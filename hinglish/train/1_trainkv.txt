 But can China also be behind this outcry caused by the waters of the Brahmaputra river? This question is arising because China did not provide important information despite the agreement with India to overcome this devastation of flood
 china ne nahin di ahm jaankarividesh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne shuukravaar ko is bare main khulaasa kiya ki china ne is saal abhi takbrahmaputraur sutluj nadi ke pani ke bare main hydrological data nahin muhaiyaa karaayaa he
 Generally after May 15 after the onset of monsoon, China keeps on continuously informing India about the water in these two rivers, so that preparations can be made in time to deal with the floods
 brahmaputra or sutluj ye donon nadiyaan tibet se nikalati hai or vahaan se bahati hui bharat main aati hai
 If China had provided India with information about the water in these two rivers like every year, the destruction could have been overcome to some extent
 2006 main hua tha samjhautabharat or china ke bich 2006 main ek samjhauta hua tha, jiske tahat donon deshon ne milakar ek export group banaaya tha jo in nadiyon main jalastr ke bare main jaankaree saajha karte the
 The last meeting of this expert group was held in April last year
 lekin is saal china ne in donon nadiyon main pani ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin di
 This could be when the spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked if the relationship between the information not given by China was going on in Doklam for the last two months, he said that he should not combine these two cases Would because sometimes there are technical reasons behind it
 lekindoklam ko lekar chinajis tarah se bharat ko roj dhamkee de rahaa he, use dekhte hue is ashanka se puri tarah se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ye bharat ko jhukaane ke liye china kii chaal bhi ho sakati he

 Niko Slate In February 1929, african-american scientist George Washington Carver outlined a special diet that included wheat flour, corn, fruit and milk made from soybeans or peanuts
 is shuddh shaakaahaari (vigan) aahaar ke saath, kaarvar ne ''bharat ke liye adhik swasthya, shakti or aarthik swatantraaa'' laane kii aashaa kii
 Can any diet really achieve such grand ambitions? The target recipient of Carver's diet certainly thought so
 kaarvar kii tarah, mahatma gandhi ek bhavuk aahaar sudhaarak the, jo maanate the ki uchit aahaar kaa adhikaar jivan jeene ke adhikaar ke mul main tha, ek achche aahaar kaa raajnneeti or naitikta se bhi utana hi sarokaar tha jitna poshan se
 However, it was not always easy to combine dietary choices with their other beliefs
 darasal, kaarvar ne jo aahaar sochaa tha uski ek vajah yah bhi thi ki gandhi ne saalon tak shaakaahaari banane ke liye sangharsh kiya tha
 They believed that the consumption of milk is unethical, but they found that removing it from the diet made them weak and unable to meet many of life's needs
 kya ek purv das ke haathon taiyaar moongfalee kaa doodh gandhi ko sampurna aahaar ke liye apni aaajeevan khoj ko puraa karne main madad kar saktaa he?jab maine gandhi ke aahaar kaa adhyayan shuru kiya, to mujhe do sawaalon main dilchaspee thi: bhojan se gandhi kaa kya abhipraay tha? or main unke paak or poshan sambandhi prayogon se kya sikh saktaa tha? ek vyakti jo behisaab vyast the, phir bhi aahaar sambandhi vishyon par lekh, patr or bhaashanon ke liye samay nikaal lete the
 He used to give food advice to friends and strangers and was eager to read science's latest research on nutrition
 ve ab bhi hamen kya ye sikhaa sakate hai ki kaise khaanaa chahie or kaise rahanaa chahie?pehali baat jo mere dimag main kaundhi vah yah thi ki gandhi ne shaakaahaari bhojan or sabut anaaj, kachche bhojan or upwas tak, aaj ke aahaar-vihaar se judi chizon ko us samay hi kaise bhaanp liya tha
 Eliminating salt and sugar from my diet, forcing wild greens and making my own almond milk, Gandhi seems to be more of a poster-child for my diet in today's age than i was when i was a radical anti-colonial activist in school
 Was read as lekin jaisaa ki maine bhojan ke saath gandhi ke sambandhon ke itihaas main gaharaai se samajha, mujhe ehsaas hua ki unka aahaar unki raajnneeti se judaa hua tha
 For Gandhi, eating ethically meant more than avoiding certain foods; It meant what we had to eat to fight against injustice and inequality
 gandhi kaa janm shaakaahaari parivaar main hua tha
 As a youth, he believed that the British got the power to conquer India only because of eating meat
 agar unhen majboot hona he to unhen bhi maance khaanaa hoga
 Sneakily, one day they ate a few pieces of goat meat
 vah ek du:swapn jaisaa tha
 He later recalled that, "whenever i had a slumber, it seemed as if the living goat was in me, and i was filled with remorse
" '' landan main kanoonee padhai shuru karne se pehle, gandhi ne maa se vaada kiya ki ve ''sharaab, mahilaon or maance'' ko nahin chhuenge
 In England, for the first time in him there was a genuinely complete belief in vegetarianism
 haalanki ve bachapan ke adhikansh samay main maance se parhez karte the, lekin yah keval landan hi tha jahaan unhone naitik kaarnon se maance na khaane kaa nirnay kiya tha
 In the process, he found the first political reason: vegetarianism
 landan vegeterian socity ke sadsy ke rup main, gandhi ne saarvajanik bhaashan ke apane dar par kaabo paa liya or pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye sangharsh karne vaale ek kaaryakarta bane
 Or rather, he became the protagonist of many issues-based conflicts
 shaakaahaari samudaay ne kai prakaar ke samaaj sudhaarkon ko aakarshith kiya or gandhi ne shaakaahaar ko kai sudhaarwadi kaarnon or ahimsa kii vyapak sankalpana se jodpha siikhaa
 Gandhi was not satisfied with simply rejecting meat
 jaise-jaise shaakaahaar ke prati unka vishwaas gaharaata gaya, ve is baat se jujhate rahe ki kya unhen na keval maance balki andey or doodh kaa seven bhi band karnaa chahie
 Ultimately, he intended to become a full-fledged vegetarian
 lekin doodh chhodia maance se parhez kii tulana main bahut kathin tha
 For decades, he discovered a vegetarian diet that could match milk
 jab tak kaarvar ne unke liye moongfalee ke doodh kaa nuskhaa taiyaar kiya, gandhi usase pehle hi ghar main baadaam kaa doodh taiyaar karne main kushal ho chuke the
 But peanut milk proved unsatisfactory, perhaps because it was difficult for them to digest it
 aakhir, gandhi ne kuch gaiyr-gandhivadi kaam kiya
 He vowed never to drink milk, but decided that his vow did not include goat milk
 bakrii ke maance se lekar bakrii ke doodh tak, gandhi kaa shaakaahaari rasta ghumaavdaar tha, aksar niraashajanak, lekin antat: bhojan ke saath unke aaajeevan sangharsh ke sabase bade sabkon main se ek sabit hua: ki koi bhi purna aahaar praapt nahin kar saktaa he
 Gandhi practiced many of today's most popular dietary principles, particularly calorie avoidance and a high diet consisting of fruits, vegetables and almonds
 unki vyaktigat or aadhyatmik vruddhi unke aahaar vikaas se gaharaai se judi hui thi
 His experiments with diet have taught us a lot, but this does not mean that he can be reduced to just a simple lesson
 aahaar sambandhi sawaalon kaa saral samaadhaan prastut kar dene kii food panditon kii pravriti se gandhi yaa to vismay main pad jate yaa chidh jate yaa shaayad donon hi bhaavon se bhar jate
 Gandhi repeatedly changed his mind
 ve apane aahaar se jujhate rahe or unke ve sangharsh hi mere liye unki aahaar vijay kii tarah aakarshak ban gaye
 Their diet and political struggle were interlinked
 unhone ek yuva ke rup main namak kii prashansa kii, jivan ke madhya main ise puri tarah se band kiya or phir aayu badaae par iskaa santulit seven karne lage
 Salt was associated with his civil disobedience movement in which he made salt
 bhojan main namak kii sahi maatra kitni honi chahie, isko lekar agar unke andar lanbaa vichaar manthan na chalaa hota to shaayad unhone kabhi bhi 'namak yatra' kii kalpana na kii hoti
 Similarly, his interest in raw food and wild food was for both nutritional and political reasons
 unhone baar-baar bina pake bhojan khaane ke prayog kiye, yaa jise vah ''mahatvapurn bhojan'' kaha karte, kyonki yah saadagi ke prati unke prem kii jhalak detaa tha
 They considered that nutrients were lost in the cooking process
 unhone likhaa ''garam karne maatr se vitamin e nasht ho jaataa he,'' lekin kachche, junglee saag ke prati unka pyaar bhi is bhaavana se prerit rahaa he ki is tarah bharat ke gramin garibon ko poshan ke tikaoo or kifayati strot mil sakate hai
 What is the most difficult? It depends on the dietary constraints of the person and his taste
 mujhe namak main katautee karnaa apekshaakrit aasaan lagata he—haalanki maine kabhi gandhi kii tarah, puri tarah se parhez karne kii koshish nahin kii
 i prefer fruit over most processed sweets and so i am not too bothered by Gandhi's rejection of refined sugar (although when i am offered dark chocolate, i easily forget Gandhi's point that ' "chocolate opens the way to death")
 mere liye, sabase bada sangharsh he—kam khaanaa
 Apart from regular fasting, Gandhi was a master of partial control
 ham gandhi ke janm kii 150veen varshganth manaa rahe hai, us maukey par yah poochna uchit he ki ham gandhi se, unki viraasat or unke aahaar se kya sikh sakate hai
 As his admiration for Carver makes it clear, Gandhi himself learned a lot from many people as well as from his mistakes
 unka aahaar judaav kaa ek swaroop tha
 Perhaps this is the biggest lesson to be learned from Gandhi's diet
 sahi khaane or sahi jivan jeene ke hamaare sangharsh main, ham kabhi akele nahin padate

 *** After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, the fence of demonstrations against Pakistan has come up in different places in the country

 basapa adhyaksh mayawati necongresski bajaay ajit jogi ke sathgathabandhanakar chhattisgarh ke ran main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 Mayawati's decision is considered to be a political blow for Gandhi
 ye pehali baar nahin he ki rahul sahyogi dalon ko saadhane main fail sabit hue hai balki isse pehle karnataka, haryana, jharkhand, tripura jaise rajyon main gachha kha chuke hai
 Rahul Gandhi, active in politics for more than a decade, was unable to keep many leaders of his own party with him along with the Chhatrapas
 rahul kii isi chook kaa phayda bijepi ne uthaaya
 The BJP managed to wrest the power of several states of UP and Northeast by bringing angry leaders of Congress
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par padana swaabhaavik he
 In view of this, the Congress was eager for an alliance with Netabaspake
 chhattisgarh ke pradesh adhyaksh bhupesh baghel or madhya pradesh ke adhyaksh kamalnath basapa ke saath gathbandhan karne kii ichha kai baar saarvajanik rup se jaahir karte rahe hai
 Jogi took the BSP under the nose of the Congress! Despite this, the Congress could not keep the BSP with them
 ajit jogi congress ke naak ke neeche se basapa ko apane paale main le aae
 Rahul may be roaming with full vigor and trying to unite the opposition, but could not succeed in an alliance with Mayawati
 iskaa khamiyaja congress ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main uthaanaa bhi pad saktaa he
 Congress leaders also believe that due to the absence of an alliance with the BSP in Chhattisgarh, the party may suffer losses in about two dozen seats
 isi tarah madhya pradesh main bhi congress ko kareeb 50 vidhansabha siton par nuksaan uthaanaa padaa saktaa he
 In the last election, the BSP got around 7 percent of the votes with 4 seats and 80 seats where the BSP got more than 10,000 votes
 ab dalit-adivasee bahul siton main jogi-maaya kii jodi congress kii satta main vaapasi kii ummiido par pani pher saktaa he
 After this move by Mayawati, the vote of Dalits can slip from the Congress's hand
 basapa loksabhaa chunaav main bhi aise hi tevar upi main bhi dikhaa sakati he
 The BSP has already formed an alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal in Haryana
 aise main congress ke paas bhi vahaan koi saathi nahin bachaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has made many mistakes in the past, Congress president Rahul Gandhi has not missed the first time
 isse pehle karnataka main bhi jedies ke saath gathbandhan kar paane main asafal rahe the
 The result was that the BJP emerged as the largest party there
 haalanki baad main trishanku vidhansabha ke halaat hone ke baad bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai
 That is why the Congress had to leave the CM chair after the Congress had more seats than the JDS
 tripura main congress or left ke saath milakar chunaav na ladane kaa khamiyaja use bhugatna padaa
 The votebank of the Congress shifted to the BJP and there was not a single seat in its account
 haalanki left ko bada nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 The Congress had to bear the loss of helping allies in Jharkhand
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa jharkhand mukti morcha se alag hokar chunaav ladane bijepi ke liye phydemand rahaa
 Not only this, in the last speaker of the UP assembly elections, an alliance with the SP was done
 kaha jaataa he ki usamen bhi priyanka gandhi ke hastkshep ke baad hi donon partiyon main sahmati ban pai
 How will Rahul be able to take allies along? Rahul could not save and keep his party leaders along with allies
 assam ke himanta biswa sarama jaise jamini netaa ne congress chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya tha
 Through Himanta Biswa, BJP has strengthened its politics not only in Assam but also in the Northeast
 modi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi kaa vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii ranneeti par lagaataar jatke par jatke lag rahe hai
 The nature of the opposition's alliance against Modi in 2019 is yet to be decided
 jabaki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or narendra modi dobaaraa se satta main vaapasi ke liye raily dar raily kar rahe hai

 skool kii kitaaben padhanaa kise acha lagata he
 But if there were comics of Chacha Chaudhary among those books, then there was a good chance of becoming a teacher in the eyes of the teacher
 chachaa choudhary, billus, pinki or sabu ko praan bakhshane vaale praan kumaar sharma, aaj aap duniya ke shor main khamosh ho gaye hai, to bachapan kii tamaam yaaden ankhon ke saamne aa rahi hai
 Pran Saheb, who kept the window of understanding in childhood's naadis, taught the lesson of moral education at a very young age while laughing
 wo paath sirf aap or aapaki aad main aapke kirdaar hi padhaa sakate the
 Uncle Chaudhary whose mind was faster than a computer
 kitna jeevant kirdaar aapane garh diya tha praan sahab
 In the age in which childhood innocence was dripping from our faces, due to your strong character composition, we also started to think of ourselves as 70-year-old mustache uncle Chaudhary
 unako padhate-padhate hamen bhi lagane laga tha ki agar dimag tej chalaanaa he to chachaa choudhary ko padhanaa chahie
 When the bicycle was punctured, how to go from school to home, then we used to pretend to think in the style of uncle in the sky as if our brain also runs faster than computer
 ham bachche the na praan saab, isiilie aapaki duniya main khote ja rahe the
 In health, we were like crunchy, packaged lays
 halke se jisamen baahar se to bahut kuch dikhataa to he par andar kuch nahin hota he
 In the days of smallness, when there was a fight with someone, we used to remember Gabru, Jawan, wrestler Sabu from your Jupiter Planet
 sabu ke dole yaad karke ham kud jate the ladaai ke maidan main
 However, due to the lack of pulp in the bones, most are losers
 par hameshaa yah sochakar khud ko santosh de dete the ki koi nahin, bade hone par hamaare paas bhi apana 15 foot kaa sabu hoga, tab dekh lenge is jaalim duniya ko
 Pran Sahab, in the footsteps of uncle-aunt (binny), we started searching for the love of our grandparents
 sabase mjedaar to chachaa kaa wo raaka daaku ko har baar haraana or uski moonche mundava dena tha
 Sir, it was good that a friend did not have a mustache at that age, otherwise we would have shaved his mustache when he defeated his friend, seeing Raka uncle's collision
 praan sahab aapke comic kairactors ke naam gobar singh, dhamaakaa singh, raaka, pinki aise the jo bacchon kii jubaan main aasaani se chadh jate the
 Amongst the characters with names like Superman, Phantom and all the parables, you got us introduced to our side-by-side characters
 billus, jiske bade baalo kii vajah se uski ankhen nahin dikhti thim
 All the girls used to take life on him
 hamen bhi laga ki shaayad aisa bal badhaane kii vajah se ho rahaa he
 But you must have understood that, like the teachers of the virtual world, the teachers of this real world were not big-hearted, so no one waited for our hair to reach the eyes
 hamaare bal to katwa die gaye, par billus kii tarah hamane bhi apana hansi-majaak or 14 saal se kam kii umr main hero banane kii koshishon ko nahin choda
 Mr
 Pran, our mother also supported your comics a lot
 jis umr main doodh pinaa nahin pasand tha
 At that age, for brains like uncle and body like sabu, we left grapes and took heavy watermelons in our little hands
 uff mummy kii wo baaten aaj bhi yaad hai hamen ki o chote chachaa choudhary kuch khate ja
 Mr
 Pran, what life did you get from your humor in comic characters
 wo hamen aaj bhi yaad he
 Today, when your charismatic mind has calmed down, we are remembering all your comic characters who, after reaching this middle age today, had brought Chacha Chaudhary, Billu, Pinky, Sabu into such a dimension in front of us
 For which no two, three, five d are needed
 sach kaha jaataa he ki aap bharat ke walt dijani hai
 Which hardly anyone can equal today or in future
 kyonki jab praan nahin rahete to jindagi ke kirdaar chup ho jate hai
 Mr
 Pran, come back soon
 kisi nae kirdaar main apane usee comics ke karishmai andaaj main
 So that the upcoming breeds do not become cartoons by watching cartoons
 kuch siikhe bhi jis tarah ham jaise logon ne siikhaa tha aapke comic kirdaaron ke jariye
 Goodbye Pran sir jaldi aaiega

 Input: IANS property bazaar ke itihaas ko rera (real estate regulation and deveopment act 2016) ne do kalkhandon main baant diya he
 In one, there are people like Smita, who was asked to give a flat in Noida Extension in three months, the builder who took the money after waiting for two years, gave possession a few months after the implementation of RERA and on the other, Rizwana who booked a flat in Faridabad in 2009 Made 70 per cent money, but did not get the flat yet
 rera se pehle kaa vakt belgaum keemton or bilderon kii manamaani vaala mana jayega, vahiin rera lagu hone ke baad kaa daur anushaasit dhang se niyamanusaar property kii kharid vaala kaha jayega
 But the barriers are not over yet
 rera ke praavdhaan bhale hi kamjor kahe gaye lekin builder isse bhi pareshaani mahasoos kar rahe hai
 In various high courts of the country including Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai, 22 petitions have been filed against RERA
 zyaadaatar bilderon or unke khilaaf gaye kharidaaron ke samoohon kii hai
 The real estate market has not only become more alert since May, but it has also undergone major changes
 ab builder rera registration number ko radio tak ke vigyapanon main bataakar apni vishwasaneeyata sabit kar rahe hai
 RERA has become a brand, but around four lakh buyers of Delhi NCR are still waiting for homes
 ghar dilaane kii maang par un kharidaaron kaa andolan abhi jari he jinaki raahat ke liye rera laayaa gaya
 After exempting all existing projects from registration, the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the National Capital Region (NCR) turned the law in favor of the builders
 lekin builder isse bhi zyada chaahate hai
 Geetambar Anand, president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI), says adjusting the new law takes some time
 builder yah baat samajhen ki rera unke khilaaf nahin he
 They have also got rights against the customer
 paise na dene vaale graahakon kii shikaayat kar sakate hai
 On the petitions, Anand says that after the implementation of the law, suggestions are made to make it practical and they are also in the form of petitions
 sarkaar sun leti he to thik he varna log court kii sharan main jate hai
 RERA should not apply from the previous date
 maujuuda projects ko rera main laane main kai dikkatein hai
 For example, lethality of government agencies etc
 jin projects main sirf kagaji karrwai baaki he unhen iske daayre main nahin laana chahie
 In which applications have been made for completion, but due to the government, it is delayed, so it is not the builder's fault
 in vishmataaon ko dur karnaa chahie
 Abhishek Kumar, president of the Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association, says, “since RERA implementation, around 20,000 flats have been found
 noida ekstansion main do lakh log ab bhi apane ghar main rahane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 We had demanded the government to implement RERA of the Center so that all the existing projects can be brought under its purview
 '' unke sanghathan ne elahabaad haai court main yachika bhi daakhil kar di he
 Abhishek says, builders were benefited by loosening the registration conditions in Uttar Pradesh
 sarkaar ne sabhi maujuuda productus ke registration kii baadhyataa khatm karte hue 60 fisadi puure ho chuke projectus ko iske daayre se baahar kar diya
 Meanwhile, the Gurgaon Citizen Council has filed a petition in the punjab-haryana High Court against Haryana Rera
 council ke adhyaksh aar
 s
 rathi ke mutabik, ''haryana sarkaar ne part complishan par bhi rera registration se builder ko mukti de di he
 Due to this, most of the projects in Gurgaon are not falling under RERA
 isse lanbaa intjaar kara rahe bilderon ke khilaaf shikaayat kaa mauka kharidaaron ko nahin mila or ve fanse hue hai
 The builders' petitions in various High Courts have said that it is wrong to apply this law from the previous date
 centre sarkaar ko yah kanoon banane kaa adhikaar nahin he kyonki bhoomi-nirmaan rajya ke vishay hai
 On this, the Central Government applied to hear all the petitions at one place
 jis par supreme court ne fori taur par yah vyavastha di he ki bombai haai court main lambit yachika kaa faisla aae bagaiyr koi or haai court yachika kaa nishpaadan na kare taaki virodhabhasi nirnyon se bachaa ja sake
 However, the parliamentary committee headed by Dilipkumar Mansukhlal Gandhi has taken cognizance of the notifications of state governments favoring the RERA rules in favor of the builders
 khaastaur par haryana, uttar pradesh, gujarat jaise tamaam rajyon main maujuuda projects ko rera ke daayre se baahar rakhane ke praavdhaan act ke niyamon main kar die hai
 Especially in Gurgaon, most of the existing projects have been pulled out due to changes in the Act
 samiti ne agast main saunpi apni report main noida ko flats dene main der kaa sabase bada shikaar shahar paaya he
 Apart from Uttar Pradesh, this problem has also been in Haryana

 But the Parliamentary Committee report quoted the Urban Development Secretary as saying that the Central Government could form a Central Advisory Council that would advise on various aspects of rera's implementation in the states
 iske gathan kii prakriya antim charan main he
 Raysh Purohit of NCR Buyers Group says, "the problem in noida-greater Noida is serious because many people are living here illegally in their flats
" builder ne athurity kaa bakaayaa nahin chukaaya he
 Because of this, the authority is not issuing the completion certificate
 aise main agar builder bhaag gaya to kisi ke paas koi vikalp nahin rahegaa
 "the government has no plan to deal with this situation
" 31 july tak sabhi projects kaa registration jaruri tha
 All subsequent projects would be declared illegal by the RERA Authority
 par kuch rajyon ne is taarikh ko aage khiskaa liya he
 The problem is that the banks have given unannounced instructions that neither the loan nor the payment should be given to those who are not registered in Project RERA
 isse ve kharidaar funs gaye hai jinka 10-20 fisadi paisa bakaayaa he or bhugtan na hone kii vajah se pajeshan nahin mil rahaa he
 RERA is now implemented in all states except West Bengal, Goa and Tripura, while six states in the northeast have constitutional issues (see box)
 assam or goa samet kuch rajyon main sarkaron kii susti kii vajah se rera lagu nahin ho sakaa he
 Its website is made in ten states
 acchhee sthiti maharashtra main he jahaan rera main 13,000 se zyada project (15 lakh se zyada ghar), 9,000 se zyada agent registerd ho chuke hai or 215 shikaayatein bhi kharidaaron ne darj karai hai jinamein dandit karne kaa kaam bhi shuru ho chukaa he
 Here, about one thousand projects have been registered in Uttar Pradesh, out of which more than five hundred are from Gautam Buddha Nagar and Ghaziabad
 yahaan shikaayatein to huin hai lekin karrwai nahin
 This situation may not last for long because the law has come into force, the builders and buyers will have to come in its favor
 rahi baat market kii susti kii to cridai adhyaksh anand kehete hai ki teen-chaar maheene main sab kuch patari par aa jayega

 The Narendra Modi government, which has completed its four years in power at the Center, is surrounded these days
 arthvyavastha, naukari, kisaanon kii samasya, dalit mudda or ab mahila suraksha ko lekar vipaksh modi sarkaar ko gher rahaa he
 Meanwhile, BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has also once again targeted his own party's government
 yashavanth sinha ne likhaa he ki chaar saal puure kar chuki sarkaar har morche par fail rahi he
 Yashwant Sinha has written an article in the English newspaper Indian Express
 yashavanth ne likhaa he ki 2014 ke chunaav main jeet ke liye party ke kaaryakartaaon ne mehnat kii thi
 Due to the hard work of the workers, we achieved such a big victory, the entire party had supported Narendra Modi
 sarkaar ab chaar saal puure kar chuki he or paanch bajet pesh kar chuki he
 But it seems that we have lost the confidence of the people
 yashavanth sinhane likhaa ki sarkaar lagaataar daawa karti he bharat duniya kii sabase tej vikaas karne vaali arthvyavastha he
 But in such a country, banks have been non-performers, farmers are unhappy, young people do not have jobs, small businesses have come to a standstill
 or isse bhi bura ye he ki pichley chaar saal main bhrashtachar lagaataar badha hi he
 Attacking the Modi government, Sinha wrote that women are not safe today, incessant rape incidents are coming out
 kuch maamalon main hamaare apane hi log shaamil rahe hai
 Today, Dalits and Adivasis are very upset
 yashavanth sinha ne sarkaar kii videsh niti par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He wrote that the Prime Minister constantly roams abroad, pictures of him embracing with other leaders also appear, but nothing has changed
 aaj bhi padosiyon ke saath hamaare rishte nahin sudhare hai
 China too is now showing its majesty over India
 sinha ne apane lekh main likhaa ki party ke andar main loktantr puri tarah se khatm ho gaya he
 Many mps complain that their voice is not heard and no action is taken even inside the meetings
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki party karyaalay puri tarah se korporate offis ho gaya he
 Apart from this, Yashwant Sinha has attacked the government on the issue of press conference by the judges of the Supreme Court, the continuous halt of the proceedings of Parliament, the budget session going waste
 yashavanth sinhane likhaa ki aisa lagata he ki party kaa mukhya lakshya sirf chunaav jeetna rah gaya he
 i do not know who will get a ticket again in the next Lok Sabha elections, but i can say that not many people are going to get tickets
 hamen ye yaad rakhana chahie ki pichley chunaav main party ko sirf 31 fisadi vot mila tha, yani 61 fisadi khilaaf gaya tha
 If the opposition is united then the party will not be known
 unhone likhaa ki ab samay aa gaya he ki hamen in muddon ko lekar bolnaa chahie
 Recently some Dalit mps raised their voice
 yashavanth ne likhaa ki is sarkaar kii kuch safaltaaen bhi rahi hai lekin zyada vifaltaaen hi rahi hai

 haryana main sielue ke naam par paise maangane ke maamle ko lekar ek baar phir se siyasat tej ho gai he
 Opposition INLD in the state has threatened to hit the streets if a case is not registered against the accused Ramkishan Fauji
 ieneldi ke netaa abhaya chautaala ne kaha he ki agar faujee ke khilaaf guuruuvaar tak maamla darj nahin hua to party sadakon par utar kar andolan karegi
 It is worth mentioning that Chautala showed a press conference on September 6 last year to Haryana Chief Parliamentary Secretary Ramkishan Fauji asking for five crore rupees in lieu of getting a CLU (change of Land Use)
 itnaa hi nahin isaki shikaayat haryana ke lokayukta justise preetam paal se bhi kii gai thi
 Now the Lokayukta of Haryana has recommended to file a case against Ramkishan Fauji under the Prevention of Corruption Act on charges of seeking bribe, but the opposition party has made up its mind to ask the government on the issue
 abhaya chautaala ne faujee ke bare main ek sidi jari kar aarope lagaaya tha ki faujee ne gudgaanv main ek sielue karaane ke evaj main paanch karod rupee kii rishwat maangi thi
 However, after this, the government had to hand over the investigation to the Lokayukta with a cleanliness in the assembly
 lokayukta ne ramkishan faujee or ieneldi netaaon se poochtacha or jaanch karne ke baad paaya ki shuruaati najar main yah maamla bhrashtachar kaa lagata aata he
 Therefore, the government should conduct a fair inquiry and file a case
 haalanki, sarkaar kii taraf se is maamle main philhal kisi ne kuch nahin kaha he lekin mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ko abhi lokayukta kii taraf se aadesh hi nahin mila he
 On the other hand, INLD has announced to take to the streets on this matter
 abhaya chautaala ne kaha, 'sarkaar faujee ko bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 If by Thursday the government has not registered a case against the army, then our party will take to the streets
 maine suna he ki faujee lokayukta par hi aarope laga rahe hai ki unhone galat faisla diya he, lihaaja faujee ke khilaaf ek or maamla darj hona chahie
 'what is the matter? INLD leader Abhay Chautala and party state president Ashok Arora had on September 6 released a CD about Ramkishan's army, alleging that the army had demanded a bribe of Rs five crore for a CLU in Gurgaon
 
 abhaya chautaala or ashok aroda ne vah sidi usee din rajyapal jagannatha pahadiya ko saunp di, jinhone ise mukhya sachiv ke paas bhej diya
 The government then sent a reference to the Lokayukta to report on two points
 abhaya chautaala ne vakil ke jariye or ashok aroda ne khud pesh hokar do logon (hisar jile ke dhiranvas nivasee dhamendra kuhaad or haans tehsil ke depal gaanv ke bhim singh) ke shapath patr pesh kiye
 Both said that they had made a CD at the government's residence in Panchkula on April 28, 2011 at half past two in the day
 faujee dwaara sielue karaane ke naam par paanch karod lene ke aarope sabit nahin hue hai, lekin sidi main ve paanch karod rupee maangate dikh rahe hai
 Abhay Chautala said that the decision of the Lokayukta is welcome
 unhone anya vidhayakon or unke rishtedaaron kii sidi kii bhi jaanch karaae jane kii maang kii
 He said, 'I had released a total of ten cds
 faujee ko fouran giraftaar kiya janaa chahie

 The rhetoric is increasing when Prime Minister Narendra Modi questions the so-called secret meeting held at the house of Congress leader Mani Shankar Iyer at the rally
 pakistan kii ore se bhi is maamle par bayaan aayaa he
 Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman has tweeted that India should not drag Pakistan into its election debate
 kya kaha tha PM modi ne?aapako bataa den ki ravivaar ko palanpur main piem modi ne manishankar ayyar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki jisane gujarat kaa apmaan kiya, usne pakistani ucchayukta ke saath gupt meeting kyon kii? aakhir pakistan main sena or intelegence main ucch padon par rahe log gujarat main ahamed patel ko siem banane kii madad kii baat kyon kar rahe hai? isaki kya vajah he?kya aayaa pakistan kaa riection?maamle par raajnneeti badhate dekh pakistan ne is vivaad main entry maari

 mohammad faisal ne twit kar kaha, bharat ko apni raajnneetik bahes main pakistan ko nahin ghaseetna chahie, is tarah kii juthi shadyantr kii khabaron ke balboote par jeet kii nahin sochna chahie
 India should stop dragging Pakistan into its electoral debate and win victories on its own strength rather than fabricated conspiracies, which are utterly baseless and irresponsible

 The question is, are the Congressmen or all the people who attended the meeting only on the target of Prime Minister Narendra Modi? What was the full charge of PM? PM Modi also said in his speech why secret meetings were held with Pakistani High Commissioner The He quoted Iyer's statement that he insulted not me but the whole of Gujarat

 Leading IT company TCS has said that the next financial year (2014-15) will be better than the current financial year due to increased expenditure in the US and Europe
 company ko cloud, big data tathaa mobility jaisi praudyogiki main maang badhane kii ummid he
 The company said that demand for social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) technology is growing, leading to billions of dollars in revenue for the company over the next three to five years
 tisies ke siio tathaa prabandh nideshak en chandrashekharan ne samvaadadaataaon ko yah jaankaree di
 "we said in early 2013-14 that this year will be good and we will stick to it," he said
 yah aisa saal rahaa, jisamen saamaanya kaarobaari pradarshan acha rahaa he, lekin digital ke liye yah saal bahut acha rahaa he
 He said that SMAC technology has created huge opportunities in various fields and the company is preparing to take advantage of them
 unhone kaha, hamaare graahakon ke saath hui shuruaati baatcheet ke anusaar 2014-15 saal 2013-14 se behatar rahegaa
 These days, BJP President Amit Shah, who went out on a 120-day smoke-filled tour across the country, spoke to Deputy Editor Udai Mahurkar and revealed many other things besides plans and plans to rejuvenate his party in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 baatcheet ke anshahapaki aguai main ubhartee is nai bhartiya janata party kii kya khubiyaan hai?yah jaruri taur par buniyadi baton kii taraf waapas jane vaali bhaajapa he, jo saath hi saath aaj kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar aadhunik party bhi he
 We will have buildings for the party office at the district level which will also have a library
 bhaajapa ke kaaryakartaaon ko 21veen sadi kii party ke hisaab se dhaalane ke liye hamaare paas prashikshan kaarykram he
 All the tools of technology including social media tools are being used accurately in this emerging party
 iske alaava, is nai bhaajapa ko paribhaashit karne vaali duusari kai khubiyaan hai, masalan, i-librari, bilkul nichle yani jila str tak achche rajkaaj ke liye ek mahakama or policy or research ke liye ek or mahakama
 We have created 19 new departments and started 10 new projects to clearly share the party's work and focus on them separately
 vyapaariyon kii party hone se garibon kii party hone tak aap party ke is safar ko kaise dekhte hai?bhaajapa vyapaariyon kii party he, yah galat dharna thi
 It is a party resting on the land of strong ideology
 party kaa saaf jhukaav satta main aane ke baad pataa chalata he
 People in Gujarat gave a long innings to the BJP and Narendrabhai to develop a true pro-poor, pro-farmer model
 usee model ke aadhaar par or kushasan or bhrashtachar se ajiz aa chuke desh main is model ne jo ummiden jagaain, unke aadhaar par ham dilli kii satta main aae
 Then we soon started schemes like Jan Dhan, Mudra loan, Ujjwala cooking gas cylinder, Prime Minister crop insurance, irrigation schemes for the benefit of poor, common man and farmers
 ek ke baad ek lagaataar nau chunavi fatah hasil karne kaa kya raaj he?bataur pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata or kaamkaaj hamaare lagaataar aage badaae kii sabase ahm vajah he
 The organization's ability to convert this power into votes has also contributed to it
 aapaki jitaane vaali chunavi ranneeti main booth management kii kitni ahmiyat he?manipur, uttarakhand or uttar pradesh main hamane apane shandaar booth management ke dam par jeet hasil kii
 We are strengthening the booth structure in 450 Lok Sabha constituencies for the 2019 elections
 hamane 4,000 vistaarak (party kaa vistaar karne vaale) tainaat kiye hai—ye party ke samarpit kaaryakarta hai jo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon tak puure bharat main hamaari booth ranneeti ko majboot banane ke liye kaam karenge
 Will the new party be merely an election machine that will swallow the support of the ideology for which the party was known? ubhartee hui bhaajapa chunavi siyasat main ajey hogi
 Yet it is not a machine, but a mission of nation building
 goa or manipur main aapane sarkaar banane ke liye dalbadal kii raajnneeti kii, phir aap 'mishan' or 'buniyadi chizon kii taraf vaapasi' sareekhe lafjon se kaise sabaka baithaate hai?main sahamat nahin hum
 We do not stray from ideology
 yah us andruni paardarshita se bhi jaahir he jo ham party main laa rahe hai
 In both Manipur and Goa, we had the highest number of votes and therefore in the perception of common people we were the largest party in the House in terms of seats won
 donon rajyon main trishanku vidhansabha ai to yah hamaari vajah se nahin ai
 Therefore, there was nothing wrong in seeking the support of other parties and mlas to form the government
 ahamed patel vaale maamle main kya kahenge jisamen aapane rajyasabha chunaav main congress ke diggaj netaa ko haraane ke liye khuleam aniatik tareeke aajamaae?congress main andruni vivaad tha jisamen hamane koi bhoomika nahin nibhaai thi
 In such a situation, his MLA left him and we fielded one of them as the third candidate against Ahmedbhai
 isamen kuch bhi aniatik yaa buree baat nahin thi
 i think it was immoral that the Congress kidnapped its mlas and took them to another state and kept them in the camp
 duusari ore hamaare vidhayak khule aam gum rahe the
 But the allegations are that you gave a huge temptation to the Congress mlas to resign from the party
 
 
 yah sach nahin he
 Where is the proof? The legislators voted for us only after leaving the Congress
 or jab unhone congress chhod di, uske baad hi kaha ki ve hamaare haq main vot denge
 Do you think that the coming of leaders and workers of other parties to the BJP will create discontent among your own workers? No party can survive without new blood
 asal main aise nae aane waalon kii taadaad party kii kul takat kii paanch fisadi se zyada nahin he
 In Uttar Pradesh, it may be less than 10 percent
 aarope yah he ki jin rajyon main party do yaa teen kaarykalon se satta main he, vahaan party kaa 'congresikaran' ho gaya he, jiskaa matlab he party ke padaadhikariyon main bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad kaa baduya
 There may be a few examples, but this is not possible in the BJP because our party never existed on the government
 congress main aisi baat nahin he jo keval satta kii raajnneeti karti he
 Where the organization has independent status, the so-called collapse you are talking about is not possible
 rajasthan, gujarat, madhya pradesh or uttar pradesh sareekhe kai rajyon main bhaajapa kaa chunavi pradarshan ucchtam str par pahunch gaya he, jahaan se ab keval utaar hi aa saktaa he
 How will you meet the lack of seats due to the anti-incumbency trends in the 2019 elections? Anti-incumbency trends such as modern-day, educated political analysts in the West have developed
 hamaare chunavi pradarshan se lagaataar pataa chalata he ki abhi tak kahin bhi siton main koi kami nahin ai he
 India Today's mood survey of the country also says the same thing
 duusari taraf pichley teen saal main hamane odisha, bengal, assam, uttar-purv, kerala, tamilnadu, andhra pradesh or telugana main acchhee-khaasi se lekar shandaar maujuudagi tak darj kii he
 We are conquering new land in Odisha
 bengal main ham duusare (number par) hai or bahut teji se bad rahe hai
 We are the number one party in Assam and the north-east

 What about the political alliance with AIADMK in Tamil Nadu? We will think about it when the time is right

 paanch rajyon ke chunavi nateezon par digvijay singh ne kaha ki parinaam niraashajanak hai lekin anpekshit nahin hai
 We have introspective enough

 It is time for the Congress to reconsider
 party ke punarnirmaan kii jarurat he
 He said that party leaders in Kerala started thinking of personal progress
 vahiin assam main 15 saal se gogoi hi siem bane rahe
 Rahul Gandhi has a different image among the people, he said that Rahul Gandhi tried, but could not bring results

 The Lok Sabha election is still three years away
 rahul gandhicongressupadhyaksh hai or unhone logon ke man par alag chhap bana rakhi he

 unhone saaf kaha he ki party ko atmavlokan kii jarurat
 The results that have come are disappointing
 unhone kaha kicongress ko samajhnaa padegaaki unase galati kahaan hui he
 At the same time, the party will have to worry about its policies so that common people can understand and assess it

 Now the Sunday Book Market has been closed following a July 1 order of the Delhi High Court
 isse kai log berozegaar ho gaye hai
 For the first time, there was no book market here, due to which there was silence in the area, with clouds of sadness on many faces
 adaalat ke nirdesh ke anusaar, jama masjid ke paas netaji subhash maarg (enes maarg) main ravivaar ko kisi bhi saptahik bazaar kii anumati nahin di jaaegi
 Please tell, Delhi Traffic Police had submitted a report to the court, which said that NS Marg is a very busy road where high traffic volume remains at all times
 aise main jab pustak vikreta footpath par kabja kar lete hai to paidal chalane waalon ke liye koi jagah hi nahin bachati he
 On the other hand, the other aspect of this is that for years, there is no way left for students, people preparing for competitive exams , teachers and people who sell books to book lovers
 hindustan times se pahadganj city sadar dipti kamishnar ” Veditha Reddy ne kaha ki ham court ke aadesh kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 The court has declared Anetaji Subhash Marg as a 'no-squatting and no-hawking' zone, so the book market cannot take place here
 This decision of the court has made a living on more than 250 booksellers
 weekend bazaaron hi inamen se adhikansh ke liye aay kaa akelaa strot he
 Surinder Singh, who sold books in Dariyaganj for 20 years, told Hindustan Times that i used to earn around 8000 to 10,000 every week by selling books here, this would have brought out enough household expenses
 ab apane parivaar ke future ko lekar soch rahaa hum
 i do not know whether this market will open again
 uttari corporation ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki ve bazaar ko yahaan se sthanantarit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We advised booksellers to run the market from Ramlila Maidan on Sunday until a town vending committee was formed and a permanent alternative location was found for them, but the vendors refused
 ham unki madad karne kii koshish kar rahe hai taaki ye lokapriy bazaar phir se chal sake
 Regarding the option of Ramlila grounds, booksellers say that this market is already popular
 doosraa ki ramlila maidan main tamaam programs or reliyaan hoti he
 Anyway, we only run the market on Sundays
 phir bhi ham ganatantr diwas or swatantraaa diwas ke aasapaas ke dinon main ghate main rahete hai
 Our business in Ramlila Maidan will be very small
 puraani dilli ke dilite cinema or golchha cinema ke bich chalane vaala bazaar pichley saal janvari main bhi asthaayee rup se band ho gaya tha, lekin paanch saptaah ke brake ke baad ise phir se khol diya gaya tha
 Now it remains to be seen whether there is any hope of running this market again

 isiilie ham isaki sachai jaanane ke liye bharat nepal ke badhani border pahunche
 We went to Krishnanagar in Nepal from this border, but to see the smugglers' intelligence passages from here, we tried to travel ahead by motorcycle
 krishnanagar se kareeb 20 kimi dur nepal bharat border kaa antim gaanv bhagavanpur he
 Here dozens of such saw machines are secretly placed very close to the river for smuggling wood from the forests of India
 nadi ke kinare maveshi charaane vaale nepal ke kisaanon ne bhi bataaya ki lakadiyon kii taskari yahaan se hoti he
 This mountainous river of Nepal flows along the side of Suhail Dev Wildlife Sanctuary and also separates India from Nepal
 isiilie ye nadi lakdi taskaron ke liye mufeed sabit ho rahi he
 On that side of this river is the Bhanbhar forest of Sohlewa Wildlife Sanctuary
 ham is pahari nadi ko paar hi kar rahe the ki yahaan din ke ujaale main nepal taskar ke korier saare aam lakdi kii taskari cycle or khud se karte mili
 All these wood are gradually being transported to Nepal from the Bhanbhar forest of India
 border kii is pahari nadi se pehle hamane apni bike nikaali phir ham is nadi ko paar kar bhambar ke ghaney jangal main pahunche
 At first sight during the rainy season this forest looks lush but how the vicious smugglers cut down the trees and hide and are slowly transported to Nepal through couriers
 nepal ke gaanv bhagavanpur ke alaava bhi lakdi taskari ke kai khufia raste hai, jahaan puraane or beshkeemtee pedo ko kaatane ke anokhe tareeke bhi hai
 But here, with the risk of attack by wood smugglers, one can go only on foot or by bicycle
 hamane jokhim lene kaa faisla kiya or nepal ke bhagavanpur gaanv se kareeb 40 kimi dur bharat ke bade bhukuvaa gaanv pahunche
 Here the wood smuggler has adopted a unique method to cut lakhs of rupees sakhu tree
 ham bhambar ke is ghaney jangal main hai, yahaan na to mobile kaam karata he or na hi yahaan aane kaa koi rasta he
 We have reached here after walking ten km, now see how the tree has been cut
 ped ko kamjor karne ke liye isaki jad ko taskaron ne kaat kar chhod diya gaya he phir ise neeche jalaayaa jayega jab ped kamjor ho jayega to ise dhire se giraakar is lakdi ko nepal pahunchaa diya jayega
 On proceeding a short distance from here, we see another giant tree which has been burnt by the smugglers from near the root so that the tree dries up and falls
 ghaney jangal main ham jaise jaise aage bad rahe hai kai bade pedo kii jade kati mili
 Some have been cut in half by fresh smugglers and some have been cut off due to rains
 sakhu or shisham kii in lakadiyon kii keemat lakhon main hone ke chalate ye jangal ke ye beshkeemtee ped nepal ke taskaron ke nishane par hai
 Despite hiding on the motorcycle, we also encountered couriers of tree-smugglers
 ye chaar se paanch logon ke group main hote hai
 Sometimes they attack and kill forest workers instead of running away
 in taskaron se bachate bachaate ham kisi tarah bhambar jangal ke is jangal kii chaowkee par pahunche
 There are lakhs of wood seized outside the outpost here and the traffickers' bicycle inside the shape of junk
 van vibhaag ke is foresti guard samet teen logon ke kandhe par 1822 hectare jangal kii rakhwali kaa jimmaa he
 The forest guard himself told that he could not guarantee our lives while patrolling in the forest
 ab aapako pataa lag gaya hoga ki suheldev vanya jeev abhayaaranyaki 452 varg kimi he jisamen kareeb 150 kimi kii seemaa nepal se lagati he
 However, looking at the data of previous years, the forest department registered 440 illegal felling cases at Suheldev Wildlife Sanctuary in 2018, whereas 149 cases have been registered so far this year
 isi tarah pichley saal 232 ped kate the lekin is saal 66 ped katane kii soochna darj hui he
 Sujoy Banerjee, chief forest conservator of the Suheldev Wildlife Sanctuary, says illegal harvesting is done by some people in an organized manner
 ham soochna ke aadhaar par chhapemari bhi karte hai lekin sarkaar ko suheldev vanyajeev abhyaaran par khaas dhyaan dene kii zarurat he taaki saalon puraane is beshkeemtee jangal ko bachaaya ja sake jo philhal lakdi ke taskaron or badhati aabaadi ke chalate khatre main aa gaya he

 Really Lionel Messi is a puzzle
 isliye nahin ki ve maidan main kya kehete hai or kya karte hai, balki isliye ki hamen nahin maaloom ki maidan ke baahar ve kya kehete hai or kya karte hai
 England striker Wayne Rooney has given a number of interviews, describing what the mind thinks while scoring goals
 sweden ke powerhouse jalatan ibrahimovich hamen bataate hai ki ve khud ke sabase bade fain hai
 Portugal's magical player Cristiano Ronaldo has proved something similar
 in khiladinnon par hamen shaayad hi shaq hota he
 They catch everyone's attention
 argentina ke messi aise khelte hai maano unhone hi is khel kaa ijad kiya ho
 His talent seems to be hereditary, but these things end with the fact that he is the best player after Diego Maradona
 maradona argentina ke aakhri world cap super star the, jinhone mexico 1986 main cap jeeta tha
 Maradona hailing from the poorest community is considered a hero in the country
 unhen log pyaar karte hai, par messi ko nahin
 They resemble Maradona in many ways in terms of their eccentricity and balance, but they are emotionally and physically far away from Argentina
 phir bhi, agar ve yah world cap dilaa dete hai to saare gile-shikave shartiya dur ho jaaenge
 Argentina have got a somewhat easy start in this tournament
 kwalifing group ke drow main kismat ne unka saath diya he
 There is no dearth of aggressive players in the Argentina f team in Group f with Iran, bosnia-herzegovina and Nigeria
 ye kaam sarjeeo acuro, agekil laveji, angel di maaria or gonjalo higuyen bakhubi kar lenge par team kii dephence kamjor he
 Argentina can try any defense player in the World Cup, but Messi and his attacking teammates may not be able to avoid defeat
 golkeeper sarjeeo romero ko pichley sijan main monaco ko de diya gaya tha
 He rarely plays for the team and defender Martin Demilis has become a joke because he seems like a joke
 agekil gaare ko chhodkar dephence he hi nahin
 Still people hope that the team will remain on top in their group
 agar uski rakshapankti ne behtareen tiimon kaa saamana kar liya, to sabko hairaani hogi
 Despite all of this, this may be the best chance of success in the last few years for Argentina, who have not performed well for years and are facing a lack of talent at key positions
 messi par in sab baton kaa dabaav bahut he
 Messi moved to Barcelona at the age of 13
 bachapan main unka shaareerik vikaas ruk gaya tha or is club ne unke liye aavashyak human growth hormone ke ilaaj kaa kharchaa uthaane kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 Messi's tone of speech is still similar to his hometown of Rosario
 unhen argentina kaa khaanaa acha lagata he or ve spain kii samskruti main ghul-mil nahin paae
 He has made a name for himself in Spain with La Liga and Champions League success
 phir bhi unhen katalaan yaa spanish nahin mana jaataa
 People in Argentina also consider them outsiders
 unki footbal khilne kii pahchaan jag-jaahir he or shaayad isiilie ve apane desh ke saathi khiladinnon se alag lagate hai
 He has learned to play at La Masia, Barcelona's famous training ground, where players are taught to give short passes and play with technical mastery
 ve puri tarah barsilona ke khilaadi hai
 Pep Guardiola, the witness of Messi's most spectacular period of success, proved himself to be the most effective coach of the new era
 unhone jab pehle pahal team kii kaman sanbhali, to pehle hi sijan main champions lig or laa liga jeet liya
 a lot happened after that
 unki tarkeeb yah thi ki laa masia main siikhe aise khiladinnon kaa kor banaaya jaae, jo tiki taka kaa niyam maanate hon
 In this, players keep the ball in their possession by giving short passes
 yah tarika dimagi or shaareerik taur par bhi sabase thakaane vaala he
 These include Javi Hernandez, Andrés Iniesta, Petro Rodriguez and Sergio Busquets in addition to Messi
 ye sab behtareen khilaadi hai, lekin messi beshak sabase mahaan hai
 He has scored all sorts of goals
 spain ne in barka khiladinnon ko liya or inke tareeke kaa istemaal karke world cap hi nahin, europea championships bhi jiti
 It's not Argentina's game; Argentina is different
 vahaan apane dhang se khelaa jaataa he
 His game is more straightforward and less nafees
 duusare khilaadi is style ke zyada abhyast ho sakate hai, lekin messi kaa asar tab kam ho jaataa he, jab ve un khiladinnon ke saath nahin khelte, jo behtareen khel dikhaate hai
 When he landed in the first team in Barcelona, he was adopted by the Brazilian gurus, who understood how special he was
 argentina main aisi koi thos koshish nahin hui ki unhen apana liya jaae or na hi aisa koi sanket mila ki ve is parivaar kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate hai
 He has so far expressed his feelings for the country's team only once, when he was fired for the first time and his tears came out, but these tears may be of his disappointment rather than patriotism
 yah kuch alag bhi he, kyonki messi ne barsilona ke liye jo 365 gol kiye hai, unamem se adhikansh kaa ek matlab he
 They happened in a season when the team was successful
 argentina ke liye messi ne 83 muqablon main 37 gol kiye hai or ye sab aise gol hai jo trophy nahin jita paae
 Some will say that he won the Olympics in 2008, but it is not seen with fondness by the players or fans
 saaf baat yah he ki jab tak ve argentina ko koi jeet nahin dilaate, argentina ke liye unka koi matlab nahin he
 There is no evidence of pride in his own city that he was born there
 shaayad isaki vajah yah ehsaas he ki barsilona main anubhav lene ke baad ve us shahar ke nahin rahe
 Argentinians worship their players, but Messi did not get such an honor
 yah desh un khiladinnon par jaan detaa he, jo rashtriya parampara kii pojishan -engaanche yaa hook par khelte hai
 Enganche is the player who starts the attack and if he plays as he should, he seems to be nafees and pride
 use teji kii jarurat nahin hoti or vah anginat gol bhi nahin karata
 One of such players in the last few days is Yuan Román Requillem, who left Barcelona before Messi's feet set and failed
 doosraa naam yuan sebastian veron kaa he, jo is sijan main duusari baar estudeens se ritair hue
 He started playing from this club
 ye donon khilaadi aise the, jaisaa messi nahin he
 Everyone knows that Messi is the best player in Argentina and the best after Maradona
 phir bhi koi aadmi josh ke saath messi ke saath khadaa nahin hota, kyonki aisa koi nahin he, jo soch-samaj kar unke khilaaf khadaa ho sake
 He has consistently been the best player in Europe over the years and therefore the best in the world
 iske bajaae requalm or veron field main ekadam ajanabi se lagate hai
 He played such a slow game that he got old
 us pojishan kaa istemaal karne main kuch khaas baat he
 Although the rest of the world tried to forget him, he sometimes made the world's knees with deadly passes and beautiful games
 unki yada-kada jaahir hone vaali pratibha messi kii har match main shandaar khel dikhaane kii kshamta ke mukaable zyada romantic lagati he
 The way they play looks like real Argentines, while Messi is the real Messi
 messi asal main aadhunik footbal kii dein hai or unki pratibha unhen turant ise paribhaashit karne or isse upar uth jane kii samarthy detii he
 They use human growth hormone, a part of the new technological treatment of injuries and the development of fitness that has produced footballers larger than humans
 ab khilaadi puure josh ke saath ek sijan main 70 game khel sakate hai
 He can recover from serious knee injuries in six months, while by the 1990s these injuries would have ended his career
 ye khilaadi gajab kii teji se daudte hai or duusare khiladinnon se ghirne ke baad bhi sidhe rahete hai
 Messi is known for his balance and his rare ability to not give up on such challenges, and is an outstanding example of this strength for everyone except his rival Cristiano Ronaldo
 ronaldo kii upasthiti or dhithaayee main vah baat he, jo messi main nahin
 We often compare Portuguese players in an attempt to understand Messi and try to distinguish how great Messi is
 duniya main duusare behtareen khiladiduniya main aaj duusare behtareen khilaadi ronaldo ghamandi hai
 After tearing a goal in the Champions League final, he tore his clothes to the waist so that the cameras captured his deal
 anginat atakalein lagati rahi hai ki ve messi ke mukaable behtareen khilaadi banane ko betaab the
 Ronaldo does not want to be the best player he can be, but wants to be better than all the other players
 isaki tulana main apane shant swabhaav kii vajah se messi akasar vinamr or saadhaaran najar aate hai
 Recently, accusations of bargaining and tax evasion on the deal to become the highest-paid player suggest that this could be merely an outward show
 ek or khilaadi se messi kii tulana karen, to sabit hota he ki apane desh main ab tak unhen saraahna kyon nahin mili
 His new partner in the Barcelona team, Neymar, is just 22 years old and has a deep connection with Brazil
 shuruaati varshon main ve brazil main rahe
 That is why, at an early age, he became a favorite of the country
 gharelu lig main kamyaabi har hafte desh bhar se logon ko aakarshith karne lagi or brazil main khel kaa str kamjor hone ke kaaran nemaar kii pratibha or behatar lagane lagi
 Neymar adopted a gorgeous haircut and business success brought him so much fame in Brazil as Messi did not find in Argentina
 messi raat ko klbon main nahin jate, lekin nemaar ko mouj-masti karte dekha gaya he
 In a way, it can be said that Argentina cannot be crazy about Messi, because Messi did not give him anything to get mad
 ek niraash sijan ke baad yah world cap messi ke liye aakhri mauka he
 After that they will have to sweat for Barcelona
 is saal unhone 41 gol kiye, jo 2008-09 ke baad se sabase kam hai
 The World Cup can put an end to this suffering, but it means more than that
 world cap main jeet se messi ko apane desh main pahchaan milegi
 It also means that the dominance of Barcelona will be liberated under the rule of Guardiola
 guardiola 2012 main barsilona chhod gaye the
 The win will also end the debate about who is the best player, Ronaldo or Messi
 lekin atakalein lagane vaale ham sab logon se zyada messi ke liye is world cap kaa kya matlab hoga yah bataa paanaa naammumkin he

 In response to Congress' 'brahmin Card' as Sheila Dixit, how workers showed enthusiasm for Kalraj, who is going to be an important part of the bjp's strategy, the hoardings and posters were made in the entire Jhansi city
 kaarykram sthal ko chhod diya jaae to puure shahar main bijepi ke is kaddavar netaa kii ek bhi hording nahin thi
 There was talk of Brahmins and the resentment of Laxmikant Bajpai, former state president and MLA from Meerut, emerging as the Brahmin face of BJP in the West, was also evident
 udghaatan satr kaa sanchaalan kar rahe pradesh mahaamantri or kanpur vidhayak salil vishnoi ne bajpeyi se baar-baar manch par baithne kaa aagrah kiya, lekin ve nahin aae
 The same thing happened again the next day in the closing session
 virdohi partiyaan bijepi par vidhansabha chunaav se pehle upi main sampradayik maahaul bigaadpee kaa aarope laga rahi hai
 As a strategy to avoid any such controversy in the state executive, all the firebrand leaders of the state, including BJP MP from Jhansi and Union Minister Uma Bharti, stayed away from the meeting
 do din chali baithak main ek baar bhi 'jai shri ram' jaise naare nahin guunje or na hi kisi bhi aise mudde ko chuaa gaya, jisamen hindutv kii parchhaayi dikhe
 The 'cow' instead of the Ram temple came on the political agenda

 Damage control by 'BSP Damage': The strategists of BJP believe that without supporting a large section of Dalits, the party cannot feed Lotus in UP in the next assembly elections

 The BJP quickly joined former BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya in the party to deal with the BSP on the issue of Dalit atrocities
 maury rajasthan se aane vaale ek bade bijepi netaa ke jariye pichley saal disambar main bijepi upi prabharee om maathur ke sampark main aae the
 Since then, the BJP was running a stealth campaign to bring some senior BSP leaders to the BJP

 The BJP now wants to create a confusion among the Dalits about the BSP by making a dent in the BSP
 modi par asamanjasjis tarah congress ne shila dikshit ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar aakraamak dhang se prachaar shuru kiya he, usne bijepi kii chintaa badha di he
 On the other hand, after the worst defeat in Bihar elections, BJP is confused about contesting elections in UP only with the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 Though the party has not been able to find any solid candidate for the post of Chief Minister, Home Minister Rajnath Singh's image of a 'hero' is being created among BJP workers

 On entering the auditorium, flowers were showered above Rajnath
 shoorveer or rashtranayak jaise sambodhano ke saath unka jayakaar kiya gaya
 Overwhelmed by the welcome, former UP Chief Minister Rajnath also thundered from the stage and said, "I am ready to give the time needed to win BJP in UP
 yahaan party kii sarkaar banavaakar hi dam luungaa
 For the first time, BJP has also become serious after the chief ministerial candidates of all the main opposition parties of UP have appeared
 upi main kaaryakartaaon or janata ke bich lokapriy netaaon kaa ek survey shuru hua he
 For the next two months, as part of a special strategy, the selected top leaders of the party will take the hearts of the workers and the public in different parts of UP about the leader suitable for the post of Chief Minister
 upi main bijepi kii chunautiyon kaa abhas pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ko bhi he

 haryana main prem karnaa jaanaleva ho saktaa he
 Especially when love is outside the caste or within the gotra
 aise main aakhir premi jode karen to kya? iskaa jawaab kapil or sonia kii kahani se miltaa he
 Sonia Pashreja's parents wanted her to marry a boy of her choice, but she had given her heart to Kapil Gandhi and was willing to do anything for his sake
 so jhajjar ke bahadurgard ke is premi jode ne ghar se bhagkar pichley saal 21 july ko court marij kar lee
 As soon as both of them came to the surface of reality, they were able to know where to go now
 In front of them six years ago, on the orders of Khap, there was an example of Manoj and Babli getting brutally killed by getting off the bus near Kaithal
 donon ne apane nae safar kii pehali raat jhajjar police line ke sef house main guzari
 Where there was an old, shabby bed in the room
 na gadda, na takiya
 There was not even a curtain on the window of the room
 sonia bataati hai, ''sef house kii haalat aisi thi ki lagata tha, yahaan se kab chhutkaaraa milegaa
 "but Kapil says," Whatever it was, at least we are lucky that we are safe and we are happy in our house now
 ”ye sef house in dinon aise hi premi jodon kaa surakshit thikaana ban rahe hai, jo khap or samaaj ke dar se apni jaan bachaana chaahate hai
 With the rapid increase in honor killing in Haryana, the number of love marriages is increasing faster than that
 yahi vajah he ki 2010 main sef house banane ke baad yahaan har saal aane vaale jodon kii sankhya main ijapha hua he
 In 2010, only a couple came to Sonipat for protection
 agle saal yah sankhya badhkar 30 ho gai
 Then in 2012, 58 and in 2013, 84 people took refuge in the safe house in Sonepat on the court's order
 chandigarh haai court main roj takreeban 45 se 55 navvivaahit jode protection ke liye aate hai
 But not everyone is as lucky as Kapil and Sonia
 pichley saal 18 sitambar ko rohtak ke paas gaanv giranavathi kii nidhi baraak or dhamendra baraak kii isliye hatya kar di gai kyonki donon ek gotra ke hone ke baavjood ek-duusare se pyaar karte the
 There were no other murderers, only the girl's father, uncle, mother and family
 unhone dharmendra kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya, uske sharir ke kai tukade kiye or shav ko uske ghar ke saamne phenk diya
 Even more shocking than this murder was that horrific statement of Nidhi's father Billu, "I did nothing wrong
" jarurat padi to dobaaraa aisa karuunga
 In June 2013, there were six consecutive honor killing incidents within the week
 bhivani jile ke nimariwali gaanv main jat samudaay ke rinku or monica ko unke gharavaalon ne markar laashon ko apane ghar ke saamne taang diya
 The relatives of Deepak Kumar and Tina Jha in Sonipat harassed them so much that they both gave up their lives by jumping in front of the train
 neshnal krime record beuro ke mutabik honor kiling ke maamle main haryana desh main awwal he
 According to Haryana's NGO Raha Group, there have been around 46 cases of honor killing since 2010
 ise dekhte hue sef house vyavastha ko or adhik pukhta karne kii jarurat saamne aa jaati he
 Loving couples believe that they come here and get security, but they are not very encouraging in terms of privacy and hygiene, and life becomes like prisoners
 november, 2010 main haryana sarkaar ne apni marji se prem vivaah karne vaale jodon ko suraksha dene ke liye har jile main protection home yaa sef house banane kaa aadesh diya tha
 So quickly any existing government building in the city was converted into a safe house
 jaise fatehabad main police line ke peeche vaale hisse ke ek kamare ko sef house banaaya gaya he
 There is nothing but a throne in the room
 alag se toilet kii bhi vyavastha nahin he
 There is garbage outside the room
 upar tank se riste pani se kamare kii chat or deevaaron par sillen aa gai he
 Two rooms in Jhajjar, Sonipat and Hisar have also been converted into safe houses, where many times three-four couples are forced to stay in the same room
 kuch jilon main sirf ek hi cameraa he, vahaan to pulicekarmiyon ke liye bhi alag se rahane kii koi vyavastha nahin hoti
 "there were four more couples in my time and we all lived in the same room," says Gudiya, who lives in the safe house in Kaithal
 vahaan koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Even our friend-well-wishers could not come to meet
 ” is par janavaadee mahila sanghathan kii rashtriya mahasachiv jagamati sangwan kahati hai, ''police ne ek kamare main protection home banaakar maan liya ki prashasan kii jimmedaari puri ho gai
 The question is, how safe are these safe houses? In these places deprived of basic amenities, the life of couples becomes like prisoners
 ”police kii asamvedansheeltaa bhi in premi jodon ke liye kam kshtakar nahin he
 Amit and Varsha (changed name) of Sonipat admit that they do not care about the facilities available in the safe house but, "when we go to the police for security, they first stare at us from head to toe
" 
 jaise ham koi apradhi or chor hai
 "varsha cries, saying that the policemen in the police station also say," Why are the noses of the families getting their nose cut
 ” police ke bade adhikari bhi isse waakif hai
 Sunepat Senior Superintendent of Police Arun Nehra says, "the police force also includes people from the same society
 isliye kanoon banane ke saath-saath police ko or samvedansheel banane kii jarurat he
 “the good thing is that the number of court-protected couples in 2010 was 216 in the 21 Safe Houses of the state, which reached 1,345 in 2012
 yah tay he ki prem kii raah par badaae vaale paravaanon kii kami nahin or sef house isamen ahm bhoomika nibhaate rahenge
 Haryana's Women and Child Development Minister Geeta Bhukkal says, "stopping honor killing is our biggest challenge
" isaki sabase zyada shikaar ladkiyaan hoti hai kyonki unhen hi ghar kii izzat mana jaataa he
 " sawan kaa maheenaa shuru ho chukaa he
 Shiva devotees do not want to leave any chance to celebrate Bholebaba
 shiv ling ko shiv ji kaa niraakaar swarup mana jaataa he
 It is most recognized in Shiva worship
 shivlinga main shiv or shakti donon hi samahit hote hai
 Worshiping both of them becomes complete by worshiping Shivalinga
 hindu dharm main vibhinn prakaar ke shiv lingon kii puja karne kaa praavdhaan he jaise- swayambhu shivlinga,narmadeshwar shivlinga,janeudhari shivlinga,sone or chaandi ke shivlinga or paarad shivlinga
 However, the worship of Swayambhu Shivling is considered to be the most important and fruitful
 shivlinga kii sthapana se jude khaas niyam-- shivlinga kii puja upasna shiv puja main sabase zyada mahatvapurn hoti hai
 - Shivalinga is installed differently in the house and it is installed differently in the temple
 - shivlinga kahin bhi sthapit ho par uski vedi kaa mukh uttar disha kii taraf hi hona chahie
 - The lingam installed in the house should not be too big
 yah adhik se adhik 6 inch kaa hona chahie
 - No matter how big Shivling can be installed in the temple
 - vishesh uddeshyon tathaa kaamanaayon kii prapti ke liye parthiv shivlinga banaakar uski puja kii jaati he
 What should one offer in the worship of Shivling? - Both water and Belpatra items have special importance in the worship of Shiva
 - in donon hi vastuon se shiv ji kii vidhivat puja kii ja sakati he 
 Apart from this, Lord Shiva is also anointed with raw milk, fragrance, sugarcane juice, sandalwood
 - shiv ji ko kabhi bhi simal,juhi,kadamb or ketki arpit nahin kerani chahie
 While offering anything on the Shiva linga, what should be kept in mind - while offering aqueous material on the Shiva Linga, you should make a stream of it and offer it
 - thos padaarth arpit karte samay, donon haathon se use shivlinga par lagaayen
 - Offer anything on Shiva linga, in the end, offer water
 - shiv ling par tamsik chizein arpit nahin kerani chahie, saath hi maaran prayog bhi nahin karnaa chahie

 haryana sarkaar main 13 mantri banaae ja sakate hankhatter cabinet main jejepi cote se 2 mantri ko maukaharyana main bijepi manohar laal khatter ke netritv main lagaatar duusari baar satta par asin hone ja rahi he
 Haryana Governor Satyadev Narayan Arya Manohar Lal Khattar will be sworn in as Chief Minister and JJP Chief Dushyant Chautala as Deputy CM
 manohar khatter cabinet main 13 mantri banaae ja sakate hai, jisamen se jejepi cote se 2 mantri ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Many young and new faces may get a chance, along with an old leader like Anil Vij
 manohar laal khatter kii cabinet ke sambhavit chehre
 
 
 Vij is the senior-most among the winning mlas of Anil Vijbjp
 varishthata ke kram main is baar mukhyamantri ke baad anil vij ko rakhana sarkaar kii majaburi hogi
 In large cases, Anil Vij has proved to be a troubleshooter for the state government
 jab kabhi kinhin muddon par vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish karata he tab anil vij ko hi aage kiya jaataa he
 Along with this, Anil Vij is also the senior-most MLA in seniority
 ambala kaint seat se wo 7 baar chunaav lade or 6 baar jite hai
 In such a situation, his seat in the cabinet is being considered
 pichhali cabinet main bhi wo swasthya, khel or yuva mantralayon ke mantri the
 Ghanshyam Sarraf's number comes after Ghanshyam Sarrafanil Vij
 haalanki, pichhali sarkaar main ghanashyam sarraf ko bijepi ne nakaar diya tha
 He was later stripped of his ministerial position after being made the first minister
 unke saath ek anya mantri ko bhi mantri pad se hataaya gaya tha
 But Ghanshyam Saraf is the second minister who has won like Anil Vij
 aise main unki seat bhi tay maani ja rahi he
 Because apart from these two ministers, all other ministers have lost elections from their respective areas
 sandip singhharyana vidhansabha chunaav main khel cote se chunakar aae vidhayakon main hockey khilaadi sandip singh kii bhi lottery lag sakati he
 Sandeep Singh is a famous young face
 saath hi babita phogot or yogeshwar dutt ke chunaav main haarane ke baad wo akele aise khilaadi hai jo raajnneeti main apni pehali hi ladaai main apana varchasv dikhaane main sabit hue hai
 Former IAS Abhay Singh Yadav, who became the MLA for the second consecutive time from Abhay Singh Yadavanangal Chaudhary, may also get the post of minister
 abhaya yadav ko prashasnic anubhav he or saath hi ve duusari baar chunakar aae hai
 Subhash Sudha, Thanesarvidhyak from Punjabi quota and Seema is in the line to become a minister from Trikham
 sudhaa manohar laal ke kareebi hai or saath hi unhone diggaj congress netaa or INLD ke purv pradesh adhyaksh ashok aroda ko haraaya he
 Apart from these, in Haryana this time, independent mlas will also have to work for the government
 lihaaja ek yaa do nirdaleeyon ko bhi mantri pad dena padegaa
 Kanwarpal Gurjar, who held the post of Speaker in the 2014 Assembly, has a strong desire to become a minister
 pichhali sarkaar main bhi ve mantri pad kii laalasaa rakhe hue the, lekin unhen spikar pad kii jimmedaari de di gai
 This time he has come again by winning
 lihaaja sarkaar ko unhen mantri banaakar yamunanagar kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karnaa hoga, kyonki yamunanagar haryana ke un jilon main se hai jahaan kaa pratinidhitiv kam hota he

 While Dr
 camel gupta hisar se duusari baar vidhayak bane hai
 Gyan Chand Gupta has also become MLA for the second time from Panchkula
 deepak mangala siem kii pasand ke aadmi bataae jate hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to say whose lottery it will take
 jat chehron main se ek hoga mantriharyana main subhash baraala, captain abhimanyu or om prakaash dhankhad jaise bade jat netaa or pichhali cabinet main mantri rahe ye tamaam log chunaav haar chuke hai
 In such a situation, Jat faces like Mahipal Dhanda, Kamlesh Dhanda, JP Dalal and Praveen Dagar have won elections
 inamen se ek chehre ko mantri bananaa majaburi hogi kyonki ye party ke tikat par jeet kar aae jat chehre hai
 Among independents, Balraj Kundu, who won from Hooda's stronghold Maham, has topped his name
 iske alaava pundari se jite randhir golan or raniyaan se jite ranjit singh ke naam kii bhi charchaa he
 Out of which at least 2 can become ministers
 baaki nirdaleeyon ko bhi sarkaar chairmani kaa pad dekar shant kar sakati he
 Ramkumar Kashyap's name is leading from the backward class to Indri in the government
 inelo se rajyasabha saansad rah chuke kashyap ko manohar laal khatter ne hi bijepi main shaamil kiya tha
 Now he can be awarded the post of minister, because he comes from backward class
 karn dev kamboj pichhali sarkaar main mantri the, ve bhi indri se the lekin is baar chunaav haar gaye the, lihaaja kashyap ko indri kaa pratinidhitiv diya ja saktaa he

 Controversy had already taken place before the proposed Hunkar rally in the capital Delhi

 Delhi Police said that Mevani was asked to rally at Ramlila Maidan

 You had to burn many files, because now we have many corruption files coming to us
 ham ab sawaal gujarat kii assembly main bhi puuchhenge or sadakon par rahakar bhi puuchhenge
 At the rally, Jignesh said that i would like to say to the PM that you have to answer why an FIR was lodged against Gogoi for the Bhima Koregaon violence, you have to answer about Rohit Vemula, you have to answer why the Bhim Army is targeted being done
 aap lav jihad kii jitani raajnneeti kerani ho kar lo, ham pyaar kii baat karenge
 At the rally, Jignesh said, "I will ask the PM what will you choose, Manu Smriti or the Constitution? Jignesh said that they are attacking us because I, Hardik, and Alpesh brought them to 99 in Gujarat

 Violence is their weapon, we do not have to be violent in any way
 ham kisi dharm ke khilaaf nahin he
 We have come here for equality

 We stand with them
 kanhaiya ne aage kaha ki bijepi party nahin washing mashin he, loktantr ko kamjor kar rahi he
 Love is politics, not revenge: At Prashant Bhushan Mevani's rally, Prashant Bhushan said that Delhi Police did not give permission to stop the rally
 isliye bheed kam he, lekin ek nai shuruyaat he
 a new hope has arisen in the country, a force is coming up against a false politics

 This is politics of love, not politics of revenge
 modi jhola uthaakar nahin ja sakate, sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga: umr khaledumr khalid ne rohit vemula or chandrashekhar ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki piem narendra modi kehete hai ki vah jhola uthaaenge or chale jaaenge, lekin vah hamaare sawaalon kaa jawaab die bina nahin ja sakate
 Now there is no way that you will cut the thumb
 sach yah he ki chandrashekhar desh ke liye khatra nahin he, balki hindu raashtra kii avadharana ke liye khatra he
 Omar Khalid further said that CM Yogi had to go and distribute shampoo and soap to the Dalits, this is an insult to the Dalits and Chandrasekhar is fighting against it
 sarkaar rohit kaa saamana nahin kar pai or use suside ke liye majaboor kiya
 The government thought that it would scare us by setting an example, but we will win this battle and make Rohit justice
 aap mujhe, jignesh mewaani se nafrat kar sakate hai, lekin isse naukariyaan nahin paidaa ho jaaengi

 On the one hand, the government does not give an opportunity to exercise the people's democratic rights, on the other hand, to ban Jignesh Mevani in this manner and stop his rally, which is revealing the anti-dalit policies of the government
 pichley teen saalon main hamane yahi dekha he
 'he said,' whether it is in the name of cow protection or whether it is in the name of the anti-romeo squad
 musalamaanon ko or daliton ko upar jo atyaachaar ho rahe hai use spasht najar aata he ki sarkaar kaa rujhaan kya he
 It is a democracy and anyone who wants to express his opinion here has the constitutional right to express his opinion
 ab yah koi kaaran nahin ho saktaa ki jo sarkaar ke saath nahin he unhen yah adhikaar istemaal karne kaa mauka nahin milegaa

 apane pehle match main poland jaisi diggaj team ko maat dene vaali senegal fifa world cap ke group-ech ke apane duusare match main asian diggaj japan kaa saamana eketerinburgh arina main karegi
 Both teams are going into this match with a win in their first match
 senegal ne poland to japan ne colombia ko apane pehle mukaable main maat di
 Both had defeated teams bigger than themselves, so the confidence of both teams would be quite high
 yah match donon tiimon ke liye behad ahm he
 Both the teams have three points each though Japan are in first place due to better in goal difference
 jo team is match ko jeetegi wo chah akon ke saath agle daur main jane kii apni sambhaavnaaon ko majboot kar legi
 At the same time, both teams will get one point from the draw
 senegal agar agle daur main pahunch jaataa he to vah duusari baar pre-quarter final main khelegaa
 Earlier, he reached the quarter-finals in 2002
 2002 ke baad se senegal ne is saal world cap ke liye kwalifai kiya he
 FIFA World Cup: With captain Kane's hat-trick England in the final-16, if Japan enters the final round, it will play the pre-quarter finals for the third time
 isse pehle wo 2002 or 2010 main antim-16 main pahunchaa tha
 The kind of balanced game that Senegal played in the last match affected everyone
 team ne ekajutata kaa parichay dete hue poland or uske diggaj khilaadi robert lewandoski ko rokane main safalataa hasil kii thi
 Senegal had played an aggressive game in the previous match without being under pressure from Poland and that was the reason they were successful in winning
 coach sise is match main bhi isi aakraamak ranneeti ke saath utar sakate hai
 The weight of the team was on its star player Sadio Mane
 maane beshak pichley match main gol nahin kar paae the, lekin unhone ek team main kii tarah maidan par pradarshan kiya tha or duusare khilaadiyon ke liye kai maukey banaae the
 They would be expected to perform similarly
 FIFA: germany kii jeet par phens ne barish main naachakar jashn manaayawahin niyang or kaliduyo coulibali bhi pichley match main behad asardaar sabit hue the or maane kaa bharpoor saath diya tha
 On the other hand, if you talk about Japan, then it is going into this match by beating the team like Colombia 2-1
 yah team world cap main kai utaar-chadhaav ke baad ai he
 a few days before his arrival in Russia, the team changed its head coach, although the way the team performed in the first match, it did not look like this team was under some kind of pressure
 japan ne bhi pichley match main behat aakraamak khel khelaa tha or is match main bhi wo isi ranneeti ke saath dobaaraa jeeta hasil karne kii koshish main hogi
 However, he will have to strengthen his defense in this match which was shown to be a bit weak and scattered in the last match as Senegal is also an aggressive team
 agar japan kaa dephence galati karata he to senegal kaa atake gol karne kaa koi mauka chode aisa lagata nahin he

 In the police interrogation, the accused confessed their crime
 na to ram kaa naam lene par roak he na ramanavami kaa juluus nikaalane par
 Before many districts get burnt, it is necessary to stop here and question whether there is any attempt to spread the frenzy of communality in the name of Ram Navami in the village towns and small towns
 in juluson main ram ji ke naare kam lagate hai, raajnneetik ho chuke naare zyaada lagane lage hai
 The leaders feel that before people ask questions of employment, hospital, show them the path in the name of Ram
 ham sabane ramanavami dekhi he, magar abhi aisa kyon ho rahaa he ki kishor umr ke ladakon ke haath main moti moti talavaarein hai, unki jubaan par bhakthi ke naam par siyaasi naare hai
 The way the effort is being made in the name of Ramnavmi, if it is not said clearly, there will not be a chance to repent
 ganimat he ki zyaadaatar jagahon par hindu or musalamaanon ne juluus kii aad main kheli ja rahi raajnneeti ko samaj liya or bhaichaare kii misaal kaayam kii phir bhi is desh main kisi kii juluus par kuch bhi phenk dene se shahar ke shahar jalane kii misaalen rahi hai
 The fire that Bihar and Bengal have gone through is not coming in the media, with the precaution that frenzy does not spread again under the guise of devotion
 magar whatsap uniwarsity kii duniya main khub chal rahaa he
 You tell me what is the sanctity of Ram Navami procession at that time when a killer's tableau is made in Shobha Yatra
 kya ham ram kii puja ko is str par le aaenge
 a procession took place on the occasion of Ram Navami in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in this procession there were tableaux of 325 deities but what is its tableau in it
 kya yah shaks devtaa ho gaya he
 a court of India , will he find a place among the tableaux of the gods
 aapako yaad aa hi gaya hoga
 The tableau is that of a murder accused who brutally murdered a Muslim laborer in December, then burnt his body and put a video of it all on social media
 lav jihad rokane kaa champiyan ghoshit kar daalaa, iske baad alag alag naam kii websites par khud ko hindu hriday samraat bataane kii koshish kii
 This man named Shambhulal Raigar is now in jail but his tableau came out like this
 ek aadmi uski shakl banaakar ek singhaasana par baitha or haath main kulhadi pakadi
 Another man was shown beating on the ground
 juluus vishwa hindu parishad kaa tha or jhaanki shivasena ke ek kaaryakarta ne banavaai
 Was it necessary, would such people sit in Ram ji's pant, think once
 ham kis str par pahunch rahe hai
 The young man who became Shambhulal in this tableau is named Suresh and he is thirty years old
 berojgaar he, bijli kaa kaam karata he or 500 rupye ke liye wo shambhulaal raigar ban gaya kyonki uski shakl usase milti he
 But in a conversation with our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh, he said that he is not a part of Shiv Sena, he did this work for money
 sochie paise lekar yah to kaam kar gaya
 But who was being challenged by doing this or doing this, when we think on this question, then you will know that the intention is something else
 harsha ne bataaya ki jab is jhaanki lekar vivaad hone laga, to ye noujvaan kuch or hi kar rahaa tha
 Perhaps he too was making a place for himself in this frenzy
 julus kaa aayojan karne vaali sanstha vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon ke bhi tevar aise hi dikhe
 They are saying that Shambhu is not guilty yet but is in jail
 to kya use wo krishna maan lenge
 Should they not wait for his release, should he not have seen the video of Shambhu in which he is committing murder
 ramanavami ke juluus main bhagwaan ram or sita or saath main anya devi devataaon kii jhaankiyaan nikaali jaati hai lekin jodhpur kii ye jhaanki us parampara ko munh chidhaati dikhi, logon ko dharm ke naam par uksaati dikhi
 Shambhu Lal Rager had tried to describe himself as a warrior against love jihad and the same effort was seen again in this tableau
 pichley dinon isi shanbhu laal raigar kaa ek or video saamne aayaa tha jisamen wo jail main baitha hindu dharm ke naam par logon ko uksaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Inciting instigators are becoming active everywhere
 wo bas maukey dhund rahe hai
 In West Bengal too, the politics of dividing people in the name of religion is at its peak
 ramanavami jaise pavitra parv logon ko bhadakaane waalon ke liye ek mauka ban rahe hai
 This is what happened in the hill settlement of Raniganj in Bengal
 yahaan saalon se mandir - masjid aasapaas rahe hai or dharm ke naam par yahaan kabhi aisi kattarta nahin dekhi gai lekin is baar ramvanami kaa ek juluus muslim bahul ilaake se kya guzara, do guton ke bich hinsa shuru ho gai
 Some shops were set on fire immediately
 hinsa main ek gaanvvaale kii maut ho gai, teen pulisavaale ghayal ho gaye
 Violents set several motorcycles on fire and attacked policemen in the local market
 hinsak ghatana main asanasol-durgapur ke disipi arindam datta choudhary ghayal ho gaye
 One of the rioters lost his hand with a bomb
 aspataal main unki haalat sthir bani hui he
 Scared after the incident, many people are leaving the area
 sara maamla ek formule kii tarah hota he
 To incite tension at the local level and then to take it to a greater level through debate and rhetoric so that the expenses of the people in the name of discussion continue
 is khel ke khilaadiyon ko pataa he, ram kaa naam lekar kuch bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The debate can be won or won on the condition that it is a crime to name Ram in this country
 magar jo tarika he uske peeche kii niyat he use saavdhaanee se dekhie
 The clashes started in Purulia in Bengal after a procession that took place on the occasion of Ram Navami
 is jhadap main ek aadmi kii maut ho gai or paanch pulisavaale ghayal ho gaye
 According to the police, despite the government's ban, BJP supporters took out a procession with swords in many places
 murshidaabad ke kandi main bhi ramanavami ke maukey par ek hathiyaarband bheed police thane main ghus gai
 Police had to lathi-charge in retaliation and drive away the mob
 bardhaman main ramanavami ke maukey par ek puja pandal par hamalaa hua
 Ram Navami has never been a big festival in West Bengal, but for the last two years, BJP and its associated organizations are leaving no stone unturned to mark their presence on this occasion
 udhar bihar ke aurangabad main ramanavami ke juluus ke baad somvaar dopaher sampradayik jhadpen huin
 The comments bataaya gaya ki ramanavami ke juluus par shahar ke navadih ilaake main patharbazi kii gai jiske baad hinsa shuru hui
 Around fifty shops on Old GT Road were set on fire by rioters during the violence
 in hinsak jhadpon main saath se zyaada log ghayal ho gaye jinamein bees pulisavaale bhi shaamil hai jo patharbazi main ghayal hue
 Police were ordered to shoot and curfew was imposed in the area to stop the violence
 mangalvaar ko bhi yahaan tanaav bana hua tha haalanki karfue uthaa liya gaya
 Yet very few people took to the streets
 suraksha balon kii baari tainaati ke kaaran koi apriy ghatana nahin hui
 The role of local BJP MP Sushil Singh in the violence in Aurangabad is being dubbed as a reaction to the action
 isi ko main hindu muslim dibet kahata hum
 So that the atmosphere is warm
 bahes chalati rahe
 Best wishes to Ramnavami, no good wishes for all that is being done in the name of Rama
 rajasthan ke jodhpur main ramanavami ke maukey par juluus niklaa, is juluus main 325 devi devataaon kii jhaankiyaan thim magar isamen isaki jhaanki kya kar rahi he
 Has this person become a god? jise bharat kii adaalat main hatya kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he kya wo devataaon ke jhaanki ke bich jagah paaegaa
 You must have remembered ye jhaanki hatya ke us aaropee kii he jisane beete disambar main ek muslim mazdoor kii nrushans hatya kii, phir uske shav ko jalaayaa or is sabakaa video soshal media par daalaa
 Love declared a champian to stop jihad, after this, on different websites of websites, he tried to call himself the Hindu heart emperor
 shambhulaal raigar naam kaa ye aadmi ab jail main he lekin baahar is tarah uski jhaanki nikali
 a man made his appearance sat on a throne and held an ax in his hand
 saamne zamin par ek duusare aadmi ko pitate hue dikhaaya gaya
 The procession belonged to Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the tableau was formed by a Shiv Sena worker
 kya yah zaruri tha, kya ram ji kii paant main aise log baithenge, sochie ek baar
 What level are we reaching? jo yuvak is jhaanki main shambhulaal bana uskaa naam suresh he or wo tees saal kaa he
 Unemployed, does electrical work and for 500 rupees he became a Shambhulal regar as his face resembles him
 lekin hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh se baatcheet main usne kaha ki wo shivasena kaa hissaa nahin he, usne paise ke liye ye kaam kiya
 Think it worked with money
 magar iske aisa karne se yaa isse aisa karwaane kise chunauti di ja rahi thi jab is sawaal par sochenge to pataa chalegaa ki niyat kuch or he
 Harsha told that when there was a dispute about this tableau, this young man was doing something else
 shaayad vah bhi apane liye is unmaad main jagah bana rahaa tha
 The attitude of the leaders of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the organization that organized the procession, looked similar
 wo kah rahe hai ki shanbhu abhi doshi nahin he magar jail main to he
 So will they accept him as Krishna
 kya unhen uske reeha hone kaa intazaar nahin karnaa chahie, kya unhone shanbhu kaa video nahin dekha hoga jisamen wo hatya kar rahaa he
 In the procession of Ramnavami, the tableaux of Lord Rama and Sita and other Gods and Goddesses are taken out, but this tableau of Jodhpur was seen teasing that tradition, provoking people in the name of religion
 shanbhu laal raigar ne khud ko lav jihad ke kilaaf ek yoddha bataane kii koshish kii thi or is jhaanki main bhi vahi koshish phir dikhi
 Recently, another video of the same Shambhu Lal Raigar came out in which he was trying to incite people in the name of Hinduism while sitting in jail
 uksaane bhadakaane vaale har jagah sakriy ho rahe hai
 They are just looking for opportunities
 pashchim bengal main bhi dharm ke naam par logon ko baantne kii siyasat apane charam par he
 Holy festivals like Ram Navami are becoming an occasion for those who provoke people
 bengal ke raniganj kii hill basti main yahi hua
 Temple-mosques have been around here for years and such fanaticism has never been seen here in the name of religion, but this time a procession of Ramavanmi passed through Muslim-dominated area, violence started between two groups
 dekhte hi dekhte kuch dukaanon ko aag laga di gai
 One villager was killed in the violence, three policemen were injured
 hinsa karne waalon ne kai motorcykilon ko aag laga di or sthaneey bazaar main pulisavaalon par hamalaa kiya
 DCP Arindam Dutta Chaudhary of asansol-durgapur was injured in the violent incident
 dangaiyon ke phenke ek bam se unka ek haath chalaa gaya
 His condition in the hospital remains stable
 ghatana ke baad dare hue kai log ilaaka chhodkar ja rahe hai
 The whole matter is like a formula
 sthaneey str par tanaav ko bhadakaana or phir use bahes or bayaanbazi ke zarie bade str par le janaa taaki charchaa ke naam par logon kaa kharchaa chalata rahe
 The players of this game know that anything can be done by taking the name of Ram
 bahes jiti ja sakati he yaa haarane par is shart par jiti ja sakati he ki kya is desh main ram kaa naam lenaa gunaah he
 But the intention behind the method is to watch it carefully
 bengal ke purulia main bhi ramanavami ke maukey par nikle juluus ke baad jhadap shuru ho gai
 One man was killed and five policemen were injured in the clash
 police ke mutabik sarkaar kii pabandi ke baavjood bijepi samarthakon ne kai jagah talavaarein haath main lekar juluus nikaale
 An armed mob entered the police station on the occasion of Ram Navami in Kandi, Murshidabad
 police ko javaabi karrwai main lathicharge kar ugr bheed ko vahaan se bhagaanaa padaa
 a puja pandal was attacked on the occasion of Ram Navami in Bardhaman
 ramanavami vaise pashchim bengal main kabhi bada tyohaar nahin rahaa lekin beete do saal se bijepi or usase jude sanghathan is maukey par apni upasthiti darj karaane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 On the other hand, communal clashes took place on Monday afternoon in Aurangabad, Bihar after the Ram Navami procession
 tippaniyan It was told that the procession of Ramnavmi was stoned in Nawadih area of the city after which the violence started
 hinsa ke dauraan old jiti road par qareeb pachaas dukaanon ko dangaiyon ne aag laga di
 More than sixty people were injured in these violent clashes, including twenty policemen who were injured in stone pelting
 hinsa rokane ke liye police ko dekhte hi goli maarane ke aadesh die gaye or ilaake main karfue laga diya gaya
 There was tension here on Tuesday, even though the curfew was lifted
 phir bhi kaafii kam hi log sadakon par utre
 There was no untoward incident due to heavy deployment of security forces
 aurangabad kii hinsa main bijepi ke sthaneey saansad susheel singh kii bhoomika sandigdh bataai ja rahi he jo kriya kii pratikriya kii baat kar rahe hai
 This is what i call Hindu Muslim Debate
 taaki maahaul garam rahe
 The debate continued
 ramanavami kii shubhakamanaayen, ram ke naam par jo yah sab kiya ja rahaa he, uske liye shubhakamanaayen bilkul nahin
 Was it necessary, would such people sit in Ram ji's pant, think once

 The Unnao rape case is full of heinous conspiracy, murder and accidents
 isliye ek nazar daalate hai is puure maamle par
 Job, meeting and rape a 17-year-old teenager living close to his house had arrived with a woman on June 4, 2017, to meet Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an MLA from Bangarmau in Unnao
 jo mahila kishori ko lekar vahaan gai thi
 His name was Shashi Singh
 wo senger kii kareebi thi
 Then suddenly one day the teenager revealed that he was raped by the MLA
 ladki or uskaa parivaar thane ke chakkar lagaate rahe
 Kept pleading with the authorities, but there was no hearing
 aakhirkaar unhone court kii sharan lee
 After that, the police registered a case
 iske baad shuru hua kishori ke parivaar par jyaadati kaa silsilaa
 The girl was constantly being forced to compromise
 use mukadmaa waapas lene ke liye kaha ja rahaa tha
 But this matter came to the media headlines
 sattarudh party ke vidhayak ke khilaaf soobe kii police jaanch main lipapoti kar rahi thi
 The girl's family was threatening
 lekin peedita ne insaaf kii aas nahin chodi
 When the matter started catching up, the investigation was handed over to the CBI in April 2018
 usee vakt sibiai kii team ne aaropee bhaajapa vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa
 The officers also saw black in the lentils
 tabhi elahabaad ucch nyaayalay peedita ko badi raahat dete hue is maamle kaa sangyaan liya or sibiai ko farmaan sunaaya ki fouran aaropee vidhayak ko giraftaar kare
 The CBI lodged a separate FIR and Sanger was placed in judicial custody for a week after his arrest
 maamla ko lekar janata main aakrosh bad rahaa tha
 Therefore, the CBI team was also working fast
 sibiai ne jaanch ke baad peedita ke balaatkaar ke aarope kii pushti kar di
 a case was registered against the accused MLA under the Indian Penal Code and 4 sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses
 hatya or hatya kaa prayasis maamle main pehle to vidhayak senger ke bhai atul ne peedita ke pita ko berahami se peeta phir use sajeesh ke tahat jhuthe maamalon main fansaa kar police thane bhijwa diya
 Where he was murdered
 is maamle main bahut baad main atul ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 When the MLA Sengar went to jail, he still did not desist from his antics
 wo jail main rahakar bhi peedita or uske parivaar ke khilaaf sajeesh rachataa rahaa
 On 28 July 2019, the victim was traveling with her uncle, aunt and lawyer in connection with the case in her car
 tabhi hive par ek trek ne unki car ko takkar maar di
 The family of the victim was killed, while he and his lawyer were seriously injured
 is maamle main senger par hatya, hatya kii koshish, aapraadhik sajeesh or aapraadhik dhamkee ke liye maamla darj kiya gaya

 bhaajapa se nishkasanais maamle main bijepi ke aalaa netaa pehle kuldeep singh senger ko bachaane kii koshish karte rahe
 Not only this, Sanger was constantly meeting the leaders even after being jailed
 wo khud ko bachaane ke liye har tarah se koshishen karata rahaa
 But when this matter took place across the country and people took to the streets
 vipaksh ne yogi sarkaar ko gherna shuru kar diya to bhaajapa ne use party se nilambit kar diya
 In August 2019, the bjp's UP government faced massive public and political outrage
 haalanki nilamban or baad main nishkasana ke baad bhi senger ko vidhayak ke rup main ayogy ghoshit nahin kiya gaya
 Unnao is behind the 18-year-old rape scandal The rivalry between the family of the victim of the Unnao rape case and accused MLA Kuldeep Sengar is 18 years old
 yahi vajah he ki peedita kii chachee or mausi kii maut kaa iljaam bhi vidhayak senger ke sir par he
 Earlier, the MLA was also held responsible for the death of the victim's tau, then the father
 yahaan tak ki peedita ke chachaa ko hatya kii koshish ke mukademe main fansaane ke liye bhi sajeesh rachane kaa iljaam vidhayak senger par hi he
 After the tough decision of the Supreme Court in this case, now everyone wants to know how the rivalry started between the victim's family and the MLA 18 years ago? We tell you darasal, is kahani kii shuruuaat unnav jile ke makhi gaanv se hoti he
 Sarai Thok Mohalla of Makhi village houses the house of accused MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and the victim girl
 donon gharon ke bich kareeb 50 kadam kaa faasla he
 We take you back a few years in the story
 makhi gaanv ke sarai thok mohalle main teen bhai rahaa karte the
 The three brothers were known as Dabangg in the area
 in par kai alag-alag mukademe bhi darj the
 The victim's tau was beaten to death in the village about 15 years ago
 peedita kaa chachaa is vakt raibareli jail main band he
 The victim was going to jail on Sunday to meet her
 jabaki pappu singh peedita ke pita the
 Who died in 2017 after beating the mla's brother and his operatives
 yani peedit ladki ke taaoo or pita donon maare ja chuke hai
 While the victim's uncle is serving a ten-year sentence in Rae Bareli prison in a case of attempted murder
 or isi chachaa kii patni or saali kii bhi ab usee sadak haadase main maut ho chuki he, jise lekar tamaam shaq or sawaal uth rahe hai
 Now the most important thing here is that barring the death of one Tau, every finger and uncle is going straight to the MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the death of uncle
 yahaan tak ki rape kaa ilzaam bhi usee ke sir he
 And now the suspicion of this road accident is going on
 par aisa kyon? kyon kareeb dedh dashak main ek puraa parivaar bikhar gaya? rape peedit ladki ke or vidhayak ke parivaar ke bich kya koi puraani dushmani he? agar haa to kis baat par?to kahani shuru hoti he 2002 main
 Till then, Kuldeep Singh Sengar and the victim girl's tau, uncle and father used to make a lot of Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 sabhi kaa ek-duusare ke ghar aana janaa tha
 Had to eat and drink
 2002 main jab kuldeep singh senger pehali baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav lard rahaa tha, tab peedit ladki ke taaoo, chachaa or pita ne senger ko chunaav jitawane main bharpoor madad kii thi
 But after becoming MLA for the first time, Kuldeep Singh Sengar suddenly started avoiding the three brothers
 iske baad donon pariwaron ke bich daraar padani shuru ho gai
 Gradually, this rift turned into a mutual rivalry
 isi bich gram pradhan kaa chunaav aa gaya
 Then the victim's tau decided to contest the election of Pradhani himself, to teach Sengar a lesson
 udhar, duusari taraf vidhayak senger kii maa chunni devi pradhani kaa chunaav lard rahi thim
 It was for the first time that the two families were face to face
 haalanki chunaav se ain pehle kuldeep singh senger ne peedita ke taaoo ke mukademon ko hathiyaar bana kar uski ummidavaari khaarij kara di thi
 So now the mother of his close Devendra Singh was removed in the election
 isi pradhani ke chunavi prachaar ke dauraan peedita ke parivaar or senger parivaar ke bich jhadap ho gai thi
 Later on behalf of MLA Sengar, the police had registered a case of attempt to murder against Mahesh Singh
 in donon pariwaron ke bich kii aapasi dushmani main pehla katl peedita ke taaoo kaa hua tha
 In the village itself, some people attacked him with brick-stones and killed him
 uski hatya kii sajeesh rachane kaa ilzaam tab vidhayak kuldeep senger par hi lagaaya tha
 Soon after the death of the brother, the victim's uncle disappeared leaving Unnao
 phir kareeb 17 saal baad 2018 main use dilli ke kareeb se pakadaa gaya or ab usee maamle main wo raibareli jail main das saal kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 On 4 June 2017, the 17-year-old victim accused MLA Sengar of robbing her at her home
 is ilzaam ke baad vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke bhai atul singh or uske saathiyon ne peedit ladki ke pita ko buree tarah peetane ke baad police ko saunp diya tha
 Then the victim's father also said that he was being implicated in a fake case
 lekin police ne phir bhi arms act kaa mukadmaa darj kar unhen jail bhej diya tha
 Where he died two days later
 ye donon pariwaron ke bich ranjish main hui duusari maut thi
 And now two more died in the family of the victim
 ek chachee or duusari chachee kii bahan kii
 Chachi was also an important witness in this case against MLA Sengar
 jabaki khud peedit ladki kii haalat najuk bani hui he
 Obviously, the matter is not just for the rape
 balki ye ek puure parivaar ke ujadane or use ujaadne kaa maamla he
 The root of this whole case comes from the name of MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar

 ) Dalit politics is taking a new turn in Bihar
 or is uthal-puthal ko shuru kiya he jithan ram maanjhi ne
 Ramvilas Paswan was doing the politics of Dalit vote bank in the state
 lekin maanjhi na sirf unase ek kadam aage bad gaye, balki apane siyaasi faislon se bihar main nayaa hi adhyay likh diya
 The result is that the leaders of the other parties are also influenced by him, and are encouraged by his decisions
 khaastaur par pappu yadav or ramai ram
 There are many leaders in JDU and RJD, who are seeing the condition of their parties thin in the next elections
 khaastaur par maanjhi prakaran ke baad
 Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Pappu Yadav had said at the beginning of the controversy that the removal of Manjhi would be an invitation to BJP directly
 ve samaj gaye hai ki bihar kii raajnneeti garibon or alpsankhyakon ke ird-gird hi gumti he
 Till now, not having a Dalit Chief Minister in Bihar was not going on
 lekin jab kisi ko bana diya to hataanaa raajnneetik rup se khatarnaak hoga
 Yadav is now asking the Dalits to turn themselves that no party likes Dalit leaders
 khabar he ki ve jald hi lalu yadav ko apana istipha bhej sakate hai
 This is speculatively true, but it is possible that Pappu Yadav will join BJP before the upcoming elections
 unki patni ranjit ranjan, jo supaul se congress saansad hai, rasta to unke liye bhi khul jayega
 Ramai Ram is another big leader of Bihar
 jediu ke vidhayak or nitish sarkaar main mantri hai
 But angry these days
 nitish ke offis sambhaal lene ke baad unke saare mantriyon ne kaamkaaj shuru kar diya he, lekin ramai ram offis nahin aa rahe hai
 He is seeking the post of Deputy Chief Minister
 ramai ram isse pehle lalu yadav or rabari devi kii cabinet main bhi rah chuke hai
 His confidence also increased after the Manjhi episode
 ve maanjhi sarkaar main bhi parivahan mantri the or nitish ne bhi unhen vahi mantralay diya he
 But Ramai Ram now needs something bigger
 maanjhi kii tarah ve bhi mahadalit hai
 Actually, the issue of Mahadalit in Bihar has never been as hot as Manjhi has done
 mukhyamantri pad se hataae jane ko bhi unhone isi rup main dikhalaayaa, jaise ye dalit kaa apmaan ho
 Then he refused to leave the chair and made one decision after another, which upset the equations of everyone
 1
 In 2008, Nitish Kumar asked to give three decimals [1306 sq ft] of land to two and a half million Mahadalit families, 50 thousand was also received
 maanjhi ne ise badhaakar paanch decimal kar diya
 2
 kaarykaal ke antim samay ke dauraan maanjhi ne mahadaliton or daliton ke bich antar ko kam kiya
 By recognizing the Paswan caste as Mahadalit
 is faisle par ramvilas paswan ne nitish ko chunauti di he ki yadi unamem himmat he to ve maanjhi ke is faisle ko palatakar dikhaaen
 3
 maanjhi ne do maah pehle faisla liya tha ki essi va asti chaatraon se snaatak kii padhai ke dauraan koi fees nahin lee jaaegi
 For women voters, this scheme was seen to be caste specific
 nitish kumaar is faisle ko radd karte hai to yah faisla mahadaliton ko unke khilaaf kar saktaa he
 4
 tolaa sevak or vikaas mitra ke rup main nitish kumaar ne mahadalit ke logon ko rakhane kaa faisla kiya tha, maanjhi ne inhen 25 varsh tak kaam dene kaa faisla liya
 Manjhi has given a new direction to the politics of Bihar
 chunaav aate-aate ho saktaa he ki maanjhi kii raah par chalane waalon ko kunba badhata jaae
 This will be bad news for JDU and RJD

 Team India has reached the semi-finals of the World Cup 2015 by defeating Bangladesh
 agar aapane aadha-adhuraa match dekha to aapako is match kii donon pariyon kaa ankhon-dekha haal bataate hai
 The first thing was the Bangladeshi innings
 melbern ke maidan par sabase badi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa, wo bhiworldcup ke quarter finalmen
 The situation was worrying for Bangladesh, soon its situation also became worrisome
 bangladesh ke liye acchhee shuruyaat jaruri thi
 The experienced duo of Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kais had a big knack, which they could not play
 bangladesh ko laga doharaa jhatka6 over tak donon ne is jimmedaari ko bakhubi nibhaayaa bhi
 Batting at an average of around 5, both added 33 runs till the seventh over, but in the same over and on the same score, a ball from Umesh Yadav was lost to Tamim, who was playing fiercely
 gend tameem ke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lete hue dhoni ke paas ja pahunchi, jinhone apane bain taraf jhukate hue ek shandaar kaich liya or tameem kii 25 ran kii pari kaa ant kar diya
 The next ball gave Bangladesh another blow
 nae ballebaaz saumy sarkaar ke saath talmail naa baitha paane kii sazaa imrul cas ko mili
 Ravindra Jadeja showed a superb fielding and delivered the ball to Umesh Yadav, standing at the non-striker end before Imrul Cass and Umesh to the stumps
 cas ko 5 ran banaakar lautnaa padaa or bangladesh kaa score 33 ran par 2 wicket ho gaya
 In-form Mahmudullah reached the crease to support the benign government
 donon ne sanbhalkar pari ko aage badhanaa shuru kar diya
 But this partnership was still 40 runs that in the 17th over of the innings, Mahmudullah Mohammad Shami was caught at the hands of Shikhar Dhawan at long leg to pull the ball
 shikhar ne boundry ke kareeb gend ko lapakkar waapas hawa main uchhaala or khud boundry se andar se waapas lautakar ek behtareen kaich lapka
 With this, Mahmudullah's 21-run innings came to an end
 ab bangladesh kii zarurat ek badi saajhedaari thi, lekin shaakib al hasan or saumy sarkaar kii jodi ne 17 ran hi or jode the ki mohammad shami ne phir bangladesh ko ek bada jhatka de diya
 Soumya Sarkar, playing for 29 runs, was quick to play shots on Shami's ball and the ball reached Dhoni kissing his bat
 dhoni ne apane bain taraf shandaar dive lagaate hue ek haath se ye kaich pakadi
 There were not even 100 runs on the board and 4 batsmen from Bangladesh were inside the pavilion
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne dikhaaya dammauka dekhakar team india ne bhi shikanja kasnaa shuru kar diya
 In the middle of 20-25 overs, India spent just 9 runs and took one wicket
 is dauraan shami or aswin ne lagaataar to madan over bhi phenke
 Bangladesh completed 100 runs in the 26th over
 bangladesh par ab dabaav badhata ja rahaa tha
 And under this pressure Shakib Al Hasan also surrendered
 jadeja kii gend ko short therdman kii taraf cat karne ke liye shaakib ke paas vakt bhi tha, room bhi tha, lekin thik usee jagah fielder bhi tha or mohammad shami ne ye aasaan kaich lapakane main koi galati nahin kii
 Shakib scored 10 runs off 34 balls before being dismissed

 In such a situation, wicketkeeper batsmen Mushfiqur Rahim and Shabbir Rahman took the front
 donon ne milakar tezi se ran banane kii koshish kii
 In the 35th over, Bangladesh took the batting powerplay, with Mushfiqur Rahim returning on the first ball
 27 ran banaakar khel rahe mushfiq ko umesh yadav kii gend udaane kii koshish mahangi padi
 Taking the upper edge of his bat, the ball fell into Dhoni's gloves
 bangladesh 139 par 6 wicket ganvaa chukaa tha or ranret kaa dabaav aasmaan chune laga tha
 The next batsman was Nasir Hussain, who showed little courage with Shabbir Rahman
 donon ne milakar 8 over main 50 ran jod daale
 Eventually, Ravindra Jadeja broke the pair by catching Nasir Hussain at short cover by Ashwin
 hossain ne 34 gendon par 35 ran banaae
 Bangladesh's 7 wickets fell at 189

 On the fourth ball of this over, Yadav first caught Rubal Hussain (0) by Ashwin and then ended the innings of 30 runs of Shabbir Rahman on the last ball of this over
 shabbir ko long leg par mohammad shami ne kaich kiya
 Bangladesh's entire team was reduced to 193 runs in 45 overs and India won the match by 109 runs
 ye worldcup main bharat kii lagaataar 11veen jeet he or mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini main 100veen van-de jeet
 With this victory, India reached the semi-finals of the World Cup for the sixth time
 team india ne kuch yun dikhaaya damaworldcup main bharat or bangladesh ke bich ye teesri takkar thi
 Team India took the revenge of losing to Bangladesh in 2007, so this match was like a new start
 toss ahm tha or donon hi captain melbern kii ranon se bhari hui pich par pehle ballebaazi kii ummid lagaae baithe the
 Dhoni got success
 team main bina kisi badlaav ke team india utari to bangladesh ke captain mashrafe murtaja ne newjiland ke khilaaf apane aakhri lig match main gaiyrhaazir rahane ke baad quarterfinal ke liye vaapasi kii
 Team India made a modest start, in-form Shikhar Dhawan and struggling for form Rohit Sharma made a good start and started sending balls across the boundary as soon as they got the chance
 donon ne milakar 9
 India got to 50 in 3 overs, but it was from here that Bangladesh started taking the test of Team India with their tight bowling
 agle 5 over main sirf 19 ran bane, jisamen rohit sharma kaa ek chakka bhi shaamil tha
 The 17th over of the Indian innings came cheaply and brought him his first blow
 shaakib al hasan ke pehle hi over kii teesri gend ko padhane main shikhar naakaam hue
 He came far ahead of the crease in an attempt to drive Shakib's tempting ball towards the covers and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim made no mistake in stumping him
 shikhar ne 50 gendon par dhime 30 ran banaae
 Bangladesh's wickets fell due to the resurgence of Bangladesh
 unke khilaaf shandaar record rakhane vaale viraat kohli bhi agle hi over main nipat gaye
 Rubal Hussain's effort to drive full length delivery cost Virat dearly, the ball took the outside edge of his bat and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim ended his just 3-run innings with a brilliant low-catch on his right side
 bangladesh ne ksaa shikanjaaran banane kii gati behad kam thi
 The Bangladeshi bowlers conceded just 14 runs between 15 and 20 overs
