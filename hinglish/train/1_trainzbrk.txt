 England fast bowler Steven Finn has been ruled out of the first two Ashes series due to a knee injury

 He was given an ejection at the time to recover from the injury

 He has performed brilliantly for England recently
 plunket ne 2017 main sirf do first class match khele hai
 The first Test of the Ashes series will be played in Brisbane on 23 November
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki fin do muqablon ke baad feet hokar maidan par lautenge
 The 28-year-old Finn has taken 125 wickets in 36 Tests, 102 wickets in 69 odis and 27 wickets in 21 T20s so far in his international career
 capatoun main bharat or dakshin africa ke bich khele jane vaale final mukaable main team india kaa palada baari dikh rahaa he
 Kohli & Co
, which started with a win in the three-match series, may have lost in the second match, but the team is a strong contender for victory in the third ODI
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne vanade ke saath-saath tii-20 muqablon main bhi apana farm barkaraar rakhaa he or tisare mukaable main ek baar phir unase bade score kii ummid he
 The third and final match played on Saturday has achieved 'final' status and the match between the two teams is going to be exciting to win it
 teen tii-20 maichon kii siries main donon timen 1-1 se barabari par hai or tisare match kaa parinaam hi siries kii vijeta team kii ghoshnaa karegaa
 Indian batsmen have performed brilliantly, the top-order batsmen led by captain Virat Kohli have done well
 shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli ke pradarshan main jahaan nirantarata dikhi he, vahiin pichley mukaable main madhya kram ke ballebaajon ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Raina has also played small but important innings in both the first matches
 in sabake bich tisare tii-20 mukaable main bhi captain kohli par sabaki nigahen rahengi, jo lagaataar prachand form main chal rahe hai
 Kohli needs less than 20 runs to complete his 2000 runs in T20 International
 bhartiya team ko yah pataa he ki agar ve yah match jitate hai to unke paas 1 test main jeet, 1 vanade siries or 1 tii-20 siries jeet ke saath swadesh waapas lautne kaa sunaharaa mauka he
 Therefore, Team India would like to leave no stone unturned
 aatmavishvaas se bhare hai team india ke gendbajjahan tak gendbaajon sawaal he, to team ke paas bhubaneshwar kumaar, shardool thakur, jayadev unadakat, hardik pandya or yujavendra chahal jaise khilaadi hai, jo dakshin africa ke ballebaajon ke liye mushkil khadi kar sakate hai
 The South African bowlers of Team India are confident since the beginning of the tour
 gendbaajon ne ahm maukon par wicket chatkaayen hai or apni team ko safaltaaen dilaai hai
 African batsmen have failed to deal with Indian spinners except for a few occasions
 duusare tii-20 mukaable main yajuvendra chahal bhale hi kharchile sabit hue hai, lekin dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki kharaab mausam ne bhi dakshin africa kii aparoksh rup se madad kii
 After the match, captain Virat Kohli admitted that Yajvendra Chahal was finding it difficult to make a grip on the ball due to rain and that was why he looked ineffective
 agar capatoun main mausam zyada kharaab nahin hua, to bhartiya spinneron ko khelnaa daure ke aakhri match main bhi africa ballebaajon ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Along with the spinners, the fast bowlers have not given any opportunity to their fans to complain about their performance
 bataa den ki capatoun main abhi badal chhaae hue hai or barish kii ashanka he
 If this happens, the challenge of the Indian team spinners will increase
 or iskaa phayda mejabaan team ko milegaa
 The hosts are under pressure
 There is no doubt that the African team playing in the T20 series lacks experience
 team kaa prabhaav bhartiya team ke saamne kamatar najar aa rahaa he
 Along with this, if the host team wins in front of the local audience in the 'final' match, if they want to change the saying of 'end well, all good, then obviously the pressure will be on the host team
 agar team ye match harati he, to uske maathe lagaataar do siries kii haar kaa daag hoga
 And this will be the first time in the history of twenty five years
 dakshin africa ke paas abraham divilliars, phalf du plasis or quinton di cock nahin hai, aise main team ko ek baar phir daalaa or classen jaise yuva khilaadiyon se badi ummiden hongi

 com / 9hg3fthrhq Even after the encounter of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani in Jammu and Kashmir, the youth of the valley are going on the path of terror, but the link of these recruitments is definitely with Burhan Wani
 8 july 2016 ko burhan kii hatya ke baad 35 se zyada yuvaaon ne aatanki sanghathan hijbul kaa rukh kiya he or inaki bhartee ke peeche nayaa chalan dekhne ko mila he
 According to the news published in the English newspaper Indian Express, after gathering information related to his family and friends about these youths who joined Hizbul after the Burhan encounter, it was found that he was somehow influenced by Burhan's death
 akhbaar ke haath lagi report main kaha gaya ki in yuvaaon ko burhan kii maut ne hijbul main daakhil hone ke liye prabhavit kiya
 Most of the encounters have been done before this terrorist could become a challenge for the security forces
 baavjood iske ab bhi nae yuva hijbul main shaamil ho rahe hai
 a senior official said that this trend needs to be ended at the earliest
 pehle kaise hoti thi bharteeghati main isse pehle aatank kii raah chunane vaale yuvaaon kii bhartee gupachup tareeke se hoti thi
 It used to happen less often that the newly recruited youth were given a big mission
 bhartee ke baad unhen seemaa paar bhej kam se kam 3 maheenon ke liye hathiyaaron kii training di jaati thi or iske baad wo goli-barood lekar waapas lautate or unhen pahchaan chhupaakar kaam par lagaaya ja tha
 In this way, in the decade of the decade, there has been a decrease in terrorist activities and after the encounter of a terrorist, the response or retaliation has also reduced
 aisa kam hi hua jab aatankwaadi kii hatya ke baad use shahid kaa darja diya gaya ho
 Burhan was initially working by hiding his identity but later changed the trend and came up with the name openly
 soshal media ke jariye usne naam or photo ujaakar kii or nayaa chalan shuru kar diya, jo ab pehle se zyada khatarnaak sabit ho rahaa he
 These days, youth joining terrorist organizations are following this trend
 aatanki aajkal hathiyaaron ke saath soshal media par photo yaa video share karte hai or iske baad parivaar waalon ko is bare main pataa chalaa paata he
 Most of them have not even got training
 haathiyaaron ke liye bhi inhen police or surakshabalon se luute gaye hathiyaaron par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 They fall prey to the security forces' bullet before executing any specific mission
 beete dinon aise kai udhaaharan dekhne ko mili hai, lekin ek udhaaharan sabase khatarnaak he
 Making this statement, senior officials say that the local people spoil the security arrangements by taking advantage of which the terrorists get their penetration
 duusari ore jab aatanki ko gher liya jaataa he to sthaneey surakshabalon ko rokane kii koshish karte hai
 If a terrorist is killed, hundreds come out of their homes to join his funeral
 aatanki ke aas-paas is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he

 ' Adding Tharoor, "the opposition's job in democracy is to stand up for the national interest, not to protest what the government has said or policies
" ' Tharoor said more, 'I have opposed not only Modi on some issues but also some of his supporters

 The Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Social Sciences in Allahabad claims that Rahul Gandhi has made a statement in his program that poverty is just a mental state i
e
 a mental state and has nothing to do with food, money and material things
 rahul gandhi ke mutabiq, jab tak koi shaks khud main aatmavishvaas nahin laaegaa, tab tak vah garibi ke makadjaal se baahar nahin nikal paaegaa
 If you mean this statement of Rahul Gandhi, then it is clear that if you do not have money, do not have food to fill your stomach properly and you are far away from physical comforts, you still have the misconception of not being poor
 You can keep yourself apart from it by keeping it

 Arrangements are also being made to eradicate poverty, but poverty cannot be eradicated unless the poor want to get out of it through their confidence and self-confidence
 sirf khaanaa or paisa muhaiyaa ho jane se log garibi se nahin ubar sakate hai
 According to Rahul Gandhi, poverty cannot be eradicated and social status cannot be changed by giving anything to anyone
 tippaniyan Rahul Gandhi said this in a seminar organized by the Dalit Resource Center of Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute of Jhunsi area of allahabad on the topic "cultural-spread democracy and highly neglected group"
 rahul gandhi is goshtee main chif guest the
 The seminar also included hundreds of representatives from different parts of Uttar Pradesh, from the highly backward castes of the Dalit community, the Nats - Musahar, Kanjar Dhrikar, Sapera, Chamarmangata and Bansphore etc

 elahabaad ke govind ballab pant saamaajik vigyaan santhaan kaa daawa he ki rahul gandhi ne unke kaarykram main yah bayaan diya he ki garibi sirf ek maansik sthiti yani dimagi haalat he or iskaa khaanaa khaane, rupee or bhautik chizon se koi vaasta nahin he
 According to Rahul Gandhi, unless a person brings confidence in himself, he will not be able to get out of poverty
 rahul gandhi ke is bayaan kaa matlab nikaala jaae to yah saaf he ki agar aapke paas paise nahin hai, thik se pet bharne ke liye khaanaa nahin he or aap bhautik sukh- suvidhaon se bhi dur hai to bhi aap khud ke garib na hone kii galatfahami paalate hue apane ko isse alag rakh sakate hai
 The Govind Ballabh Pant Institute issued a press release on Monday night, claiming to have made such a controversial statement by Rahul Gandhi
 santhaan ne dalit samudaay kii behad pichhadi hui saat jatiyon ke pratinidhiyon se rahul gandhi va duusare congress netaaon ke bich baatcheet or bahes kaa kaarykram somvaar kii shaam ko yojit kiya tha
 Along with Rahul Gandhi, Congress General Secretary Madhusudan Mistry and UP Congress President Nirmal Khatri were also present at the event
 somvaar ko hi elahabaad ke ek anya kaarykram main rahul gandhi ne beemaari ko garibi kii sabase badi vajah bataaya tha
 In this program, Rahul Gandhi said that his government is running all the schemes for the poor
 garibi ko khatm karne ke bhi intjaam kiye ja rahe hai, lekin garibi ko tab tak khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa, jab tak ki garib apane aatmavishvaas or aatmbal ke jariye isse baahar nahin nikalnaa chahega
 People cannot get out of poverty just by providing food and money
 rahul gandhi ke mutabik, kisi ko kuch dekar garibi nahin dur kii ja sakati or na hi uskaa soshal states badla ja saktaa he
 The comments rahul gandhi ne yah baaten elahabaad ke jhunsi ilaake ke govind ballab pant saamaajik vigyaan santhaan ke dalit risource centre dwaara "samskruti- janatantr kaa prasar or ati upekshit samooh" vishyak par yojit karai gai goshtee main kahi

 Representatives of these castes, describing their poverty and social conditions, demanded Rahul Gandhi to do something for himself, in return, the Congress Crown Prince gave him the advice to remove poverty through mental confidence, although in view of the Lok Sabha elections Rahul Gandhi instructed these castes to become active in politics and prepare their representatives
 unhone kaha ki maujuud siyaasi halaat main kam taadaad vaali jatiyon ke log emele jaise bade padon par nahin jeet sakate, lekin panchayat chunaavon main vah apana pradhan jarur chun sakate hai
 He assured these delegates to continue this new relationship far away
 is goshti main duusari partiyon kaa koi bhi netaa shaamil nahin tha

 5 crore unemployed will stand in search of jobs
 bajet is baat ke liye behatar avasar tha ki vitt mantri aisi thos nitiyaan banaaen or aavanton karen jisase naukariyon kaa srijan raftaar pakad saken
 But in the matter of job creation, the government is focusing on correcting the data and adopting the existing options
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki gramin arthvyavastha or nijee kshetron main ubharate sector ke dam par naukariyaan badhengin

 The Finance Minister has made a provision of Rs 3,794 crore to boost employment in msmes

 is vajah se sarkaar ne pashupaalan, food park aadi par jor diya he
 Government sources say that 98 per cent of the enterprises are outside the purview of the Labor Record Bureau, hence the exact figure of jobs is not available
 isliye nijee or saarvajanik kshetra se hasil jatil aankadon ke aadhaar par vaastavik tasviir hasil karne kii koshish ho rahi he
 According to sources, the Finance Ministry has identified sectors such as Solar Equipment Manufacturing, Cyber security, Ayurveda, Yoga, Electronics and Telecom Manufacturing to create jobs

 The festival was usually attended by students from engineering colleges in Bihar and Jharkhand and Bengal, but due to our college center being within the ISM campus, we were also allowed to participate in the festival

 Since this function was to be held late at night and the ISM campus was 15-20 km away from my house, i had to return home with my parents at 9 am
 mujhe yaad he ki main bahut royi thi ki mujhe raat main vahiin chhod diya jaae taaki main apana aword khud dow kalam se risive karti, lekin gharavaale taiyaar nahin hue or meraa aword mere badale mere college ke anya saathiyon ne risive kiya

 dow kalam agle din iesaim ke bi-tech or em-tech students ke bich ek lacture dene vaale the, maine vahaan ke chaatro se madad maangi or management se parmishan lekar agle din vahaan pahunch gai
 After the lecture, when Kalam started coming out of the hall, i reached him with great difficulty, with his certificates
 
 
 
 And the certificates were extended towards them, saying, 'sir, i am Swati, winner of yesterday's Extempore and one-act Play Competition, could not come to collect her award yesterday, so today i have come to meet you
 ' On this matter, Dr
 Kalam stepped towards the door, he stopped, then turned towards me, extended his hand and said
 
 
 
 Then i thought how could a boy named Swati
 kyonki jab tumhaara naam pukaara gaya tha tab ek chaatr ye aword lene aayaa tha
 Next time, don't compromise with such things, if you have won the competition then you should also receive the award

 i started wondering what was it like in this person that after he left the country was mourned and even a common citizen like me has memories of him
 khabaron ke kolahal main, bahuterey yaadon ke bich meri aankhon ke saamne 1998 kaa march maheenaa gum gaya
 As i was graduating, the prestigious Engineering College ISM in Dhanbad, my home town, had a 'spring Saturnalia Festival', a three-day students' festival held annually
 is festival main aamtaur par bihar or jharkhand or bengal ke ejineering college ke chaatr bhaag lete the, lekin hamaare college kaa centre iesaim campus ke bheetar hone ke kaaran hamen bhi is festival main bhaag lene kii ijazat mil jaati thi
 
 
 
 
 And I, along with my college colleagues, participated in many competitions for this festival
 teen din khatm hote-hote hamane sanyukt rup se naatak, badminton or maine ekal rup se ekstempor pratiyogita main aword jeeta tha
 It is after midnight on the last day of the Award Distribution Festival
 
 
 
 Before that there were cultural events, and our Chief Guest was then Bharat Ratna Missile Man Dr
 APJ Abdul Kalam
 dow kalam dopaher 4 baje ek navy green four seater chupar se iesaim ke loar ground main utre the
 At that time, even the helipad of our city could not challenge the ground of ISM
 chunki ye function der raat honi thi or iesaim campus mere ghar se 15-20 kimi dur tha to mujhe man masos kar raat 9 bajte-bajte mujhe apane parents ke saath ghar lautnaa padaa
 i remember that i cried so much that i would be left there at night so that i would receive my award from Dr
 Kalam myself, but the householders were not prepared and my award was received by my other college colleagues instead of me
 main bahut dukhi thi, gharavaalon ko samajha paane main asamarth thi ki meraa kya chhot rahaa he lekin mere saathi meri is manodasha se vaakif the
 Dr
 Kalam was to deliver a lecture between ism's b-tech and m-tech students the next day, i sought help from the students there and reached there the next day after taking permission from the management
 lacture ke baad jab kalam haul se nikalne lage to main badi mushkil se unke paas pahunchi, apane certifikates ke saath

 Today we have brought you a quiz related to some leaders of India, in which we have written a short introduction with four pictures, and you have to identify which leader we are talking about
 
 
 (dhyaan rahe, mahila or purush kaa bhed bataane se bachane ke liye hamane sabhi jagah pulling-suchak shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he) Hello, Ravish Kumar
 ol india council for technical ajukeshan kii site ke anusaar bharat main 6000(6223) se zyada sarkari or gair-sarkari ejineering and technalji kalege hai
 The same site shows that there are 3139 polytechnic institutions
 internet par yahaan vahaan se mili aankadon ke anusaar hamaare desh main har saal 15 lakh ejeeniyar banakar nikalate hai, magar inamen se 70 se 80 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari ke laayak nahin hai
 Such reports keep coming and we also do not pay proper attention, but in the last few days of prime time, what is the reason to discuss that the salary of the electrician is more than the engineer, then be surprised by the interest of the people

 sochaa ki aaj is masale ko vistaar se tatolte hai
 Whose report was credited, Namrata Singh of the Times of India filed a story that the monthly salary of the twelfth pass electrician is Rs 11300, while the salary of an engineer with a degree is Rs 14800 ie Rs 3500
 donon kii selary main samaan gati se vruddhi hoti he
 In the last six years, the salary of an electrician plumber, technician has increased
 jabaki iti ejiniyaron kii entry level tankhwaah lagbhag utani hi he
 This survey is from teamlease
 inkaa kahana he ki das saal pehle jab iti boom hua tha tab kaaphi maang thi
 Since then, there has been a demand of four lakh IT engineers annually, that is, there has been no significant growth, while the number of engineers coming into the IT sector itself has increased to 1
5 million
 pichley kuch saal se algalag sansthaaon kii aisi kai report aa chuki he ki hamaare zyaadaatar ejeeniyar naukari dene yogya nahin hai
 a survey by National Association of Software and Services Companies, or NASSCOM in 2011, showed that 75 percent of technical graduates are not fit for jobs
 60 arab dollar kaa iti udyog in ejiniyaron ko bhartee karne ke baad training par kareeb ek arab dollar kharch karte hai
 There is a complaint that the gap between degree and skill means knowledge and skill
 par ye kaise ho gaya ki gyaan kaa matlab hunar nahin rahaa yaa hunar gyaan se alag ho gaya
 Skill development programs started to bridge this gap and now it is also a political slogan
 pradhanmantri narendra modi skill deveopment kii baat baar-baar karte hai
 The previous government has also developed programs for skill development with Germany in 2009
 hamen internet se germany ke skill deveopment par iconomist kaa ek lekh mila he or amareeki radio enpiaar kaa
 Whatever we came to know from the video of both of us felt that we should share with you
 yah tasviir hamane you-tub se lee he hamberg vokational and training institut kii tasviir he jisamen chaatro ko sadak banane se lekar duct banane kaa kaam, badhaigiri kaa kaam sikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Overall, it was found that the dual system operates in Germany
 vahaan ke hai skool ke aadhe se zyada chaatr 344 kaarobaar main se kisi ek main training lete hai
 Whether it is leather work or dental technician
 iske liye chaatro ko sarkaar se maheene main 900 dollar ke kareeb training bhatta bhi miltaa he
 The courses of skill development either form trade unions or companies
 vahaan kaa chembers or kamrs and industries imtahaan kaa aayojan karata he
 Spain, from Britain to India, all want to adopt this model of Germany's skill development
 electrician or ejeeniyar kii tankhwaah kii survey karne vaali company kahati he ki electrician fitre or plumber kii maang bahut zyada he or mil nahin rahe hai
 One must consider the value of a company before directly relying on its data
 iske liye jeke cement ke ek vigyaapan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum
 Many times advertisements are called more than the promotion of their product
 is vigyaapan main professor sahab poochhate hai ki duniya kaa stonguest material kya he
 The answer comes
 
 Hexagonal Diamond Sir
 to doosraa kahata he ki sar its nitrite
 So a boy stands up and says sorry JK Super Cement is the strongest
 to bachche hans padate hai
 So the boy replies that OA will do the engineering by building or play quiz quiz
 kya ye vigyaapan, gyaan or kaushal ke antar ko ubhaar nahin rahaa
 If practical cleverness is eligible, then there must also have been a deficiency in knowledge
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ab ejeeniyar kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Those jobs are in the unorganized sector such as electric fitters and plumbers
 jinhen rakhana or nikaalnaa aasaan he
 a report by Aspiring Minds came out in February this year
 iske anusaar 20 pratishat se bhi kam ejeeniyar iti kshetra main naukari ke laayak hai
 Less than 8 percent of engineers deserve core engineering
 jab 90 pratishat se zyada ejiniyaron ko naukari chahie
 Aspiring Minds has also written in its report that in such an economy, there is such a large number of educated unemployed, it is not good for the efficiency of the economy and also in terms of social stability
 company ne kaaran yah bataaya he ki padhai likhaai kii gunvattta bahut acchhee nahin he
 Don't have basic knowledge of your subject
 kalege ke course main to he, magar shikshan kaa str yaa sikhaane kii kala zyaadaatar kalejon kii kharaab he
 a statement by Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu was published in the Economic Times of 6 September which he gave at the convocation of Vellore Institute of Technology
 akhbaar kii report ke anusaar shahari vikaas mantri ne nasakom kii report kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki 15 pratishat hi ejeeniyar naukari ke yogya hai
 The time has come for us to think whether we have quality engineers
 china ke chaatro kaa 34 pratishat ejineering kii padhai karata he jabaki bharat main kul chaatro kaa maatr 6 pratishat
 Is Venkaiah saying that more engineers are needed or that he is saying that the quality of the exits should be good or that he is saying both
 ek sawaal yah bhi he
 Secondly, if the demand of electricians, plumbers and technicians is increasing then how can they be taken advantage of
 kya hamaare paas aisi koi yojana he, aisa koi centre hai jo aisi naukariyon ke liye kam paise main prashikshan de saken
 Most people get jobs only after learning from their experience
 kai tarah ke angel hai baat karenge prime time main
 Laying of votes on the basis of religion in elections does not deter some political parties
 supreme court ne beete hafte ek ahm faisla bhi diya tha ki 'dharm, nasl, jati, samudaay yaa bhashaa ke aadhaar par vot maanga janaa chunaav kanoon praavdhaan ke tahat bhrasht tarika he
 The Ulama of Baghpat have also taken important steps against those seeking votes on the basis of religion
 bagpat-badot ke shahar imam ne elaan kiya he ki masjid main aakar photo khinchaakar muslimo ko apane paksh main karne ke daawa karne waalon par masjid main aane kii manaahi rahegi, agar masjid main aada he to sirf ibaadat ke liye aaen
 According to the city Imam Arif ul Haq, donations from political parties in the name of Imdad have been banned in 550 mosques and 143 madrasas of Baghpat
 bagpat kii foons vaali masjid main ulimaon kii baithak ke baad shahar imam ne ye elaan kiye
 The Ulama said that those who spread hatred should not be sanctioned at any cost
 ulimaon kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki logon ko vot dete samay party ko nahin pratyaashee ko dekhnaa chahie, uske puraane itihaas par gaur karnaa chahie
 Whoever carries the candidate along, the vote should be given to him or her, irrespective of the party
 Let us know that nominations for the first phase of UP assembly elections are starting from Tuesday
 bagpat main pehle charan main hi 11 farvari ko matdaan hona he

 a case has come to light in Karnataka that those sleeping outside will not be able to sleep
 darasal hua yah ki bangalore ke hebbal main ek mahila baahar so rahi thi
 Meanwhile, a spider entered her ear
 mahila kaa naam lakshmi (49) he
 But due to being sleepy, she does not know
 iske baad unke sar main dard shuru ho gaya
 At first i felt that the head ache must have been caused by some other reason
 lekin dhire-dhire dard or badhane laga to unako aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Lakshmi told the doctors that the pain starts slowly and then wakes up with a sharp shiver
 doctor ne jaisi hi kaan main torch lagaakar dekha to dard or bad gaya
 The doctors were examining him with a flashlight, then the spider started trying to come out with the help of his light
 doctoron ne isko mobile se uskaa video bana liya
 After the spider came out, Lakshmi got relief from the pain
 pehle to laga ki sar dard kisi or vajah se ho rahaa hoga
 But gradually the pain started increasing and he was taken to the hospital
 lakshmi ne doctoron ko bataaya ki dard dhire-dhire shuru hota he or phir tej se siharan se uthati he
 The pain increased as soon as the doctor saw a flashlight in his ear
 doctor torch lagaakar jaanch kar hi rahe the tabhi uski roshni ke sahare vah makadi baahar aane kii koshish karne lagi
 The doctors made it a video of it from mobile
 makadi ke baahar aane ke baad lakshmi ko dard se raahat mil gai
 Mumbai, the city of dreams, loots with both hands
 lekin aazaadee ke maamle main mumbai kaa haath in dinon tang he
 This city has experienced an amazing collapse! It is surprising to see India moving towards the 67th anniversary of its independence, what was the freedom achieved through so much hard work? Was it for And from whom? Take a look around you
 kya dikhaa? aakhir ham kis kism kii aazaadee kii baat kar rahe hai? kam-se-kam ek aazaadee to aisi he hi jiske bare main ham jaanate hai ki vah jald hi hamaare haath se phisalane vaali he—abhivyakti kii aazaadee
 In this case, once you kneel, what is left then? i am not in favor of making this a private matter, but the disgusting controversy that arose on my tweet last week is a shoddy and roadblind version of public discourse
 is ghatana par jis tarah kii sasti pratikriyaayein di gayi, unke baavjood main kisi ko khush karne ke liye mumbai or maharashtra ke prati apni aasthaa or shraddha kaa saream dikhaava karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hum
 i am upset about the fact that political forces are openly using muscle power
 main darasal bilkul alag baat ko lekar pareshaan hum: ham dekh rahe hai ki siyaasi takatein khulkar puri nagnata ke saath baahubal kaa prayog kar rahi hai
 In addition, the way some elected gangs are doing electoral politics while wooing their selected vote banks, they can be barbaric towards anyone whose views do not match their interests
 in siyaasi thagon ne aazaadee kaa sauda kar daalaa he
 The whole issue has become about their independence versus the independence of everyone else
 ab, jabaki ek bahuprachaarit shabd 'ilit’ ko hamaare jaise logon ke liye ek gaali kii tarah aadhikarik manyata di ja chuki he or ise jab chaahe tab hamaari ore oochaal diya jaataa he, aakhir ham kya karen? kya ham apane-apane konon main dubak kar baith jaaen or darate rahen? is desh main aise anginat netaa hai jinhone janata ko thaga- lutaa he or ratorat karodpati ban gaye hai

 They live in luxurious houses, drive big cars and have so much wealth which is not accounted for
 kuch ke khilaaf to gambhir aapraadhik aarope hai
 These are the people who want to silence the public
 ye vahi log hai jo pej 3 ke logon ke bare main abhadra baaten karte hai
 After all, what is the reason for their dissatisfaction? Is it just money? It is not
 paisa to bilkul nahin, isse bhi bura kuch he
 This is a matter in mind
 paisa to khayr koi bhi bana saktaa he, lekin aap vichaar ko kis bazaar se kharidenge? naaraazgi darasal duusare tareeke se vichaar karne ko lekar he
 Their real frustration is that no matter how much money they have made in their life, the one thing they always yearn for, but the one who runs away from them is prestige
 ab izzat to ve kama nahin paaenge, to behatar he ki izzat ganvaate raho
 The suppression of free thought is actually the result of this frustration
 jis kisi kaa unase alag vichaar hota he, use ek saaf sandesh pahunchaa diya jaataa he ki yaa to hamaari baat kaho yaa phir! yaa to hamaare hisaab se socho yaa phir! aakhir inhen dar kis baat kaa he? jab bhi main aisi dikhaawati baaten padhati hum jisamen maharashtra ke gathan ke vakt 1956 main 105 logon ke shahid hone kaa hawala diya jaataa he, to main poochna chaahati hum ki aakhir kis ek rajnatik dal ne aaj tak ek aam marathi ke jivan main sudhaar laane ke liye kuch kiya he? netaa yadi vastav main inaki smritiyon ko yaad karte hue eemaandaar or gambhir hote to unhone yah sunishchit kiya hota ki har morche par maharashtra sampann bane
 He would have focused on making Mumbai a world-class metropolis, while the opposite is true
 maharashtra bikhar chukaa he
 Mumbai is counted among the dirtiest cities in the world
 rosemara ke jivan main bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 And now this is Surat - intolerance and intimidation, rivalry and violence
 mumbai par ecchhatra raaj kaayam karne ke liye ek ghinauni ladaai ladi ja rahi he
 No matter how dirty, no smelly, but Mumbai is still the top city of India
 ek baar mumbai aapke kabje main ho to phir or kya kehane
 There is a lot at stake here
 yahi vajah he ki ek adad or saadhaaran si twit bhi itani gandi pratikriyaaon ko janm detii he jabaki usne kisi kamjor nas par nahin balki ek kamajori par haath rakhaa tha
 Nobody wants a golden hen named Mumbai to slip from his hand
 aakhir apane bashindon ke bagaiyr ek shahar hota bhi kya he? mumbai apane asaadhaaran logon ke kaaran hi mumbai he
 Mumbai is every Mumbaikar's own
 or agar koi ek cheez he jisase mumbaikar nafrat karata he to vah he dhauns-dhamkee or munh band karnaa

 Batham said, England's team is number one for a reason
 unhone pichley do saal se bhi adhik samay main behtareen khel dikhaaya he or unki safalataa aage bhi jari rahani chahie

 unhone kaha, england ne number ek team banane kaa adhikaar hasil kiya he or unhone aisa sarvshereshth cricket khelkar kiya he
 This is not a result of the failure of others, it is due to England's unmatched performance
 or duniya kii sarvshereshth team ko dhanyavad, ab main maidan ke andar or baahar apana sir garv se uthaakar chal saktaa hum

 According to Karjankari, a 74-year-old man was driving through a dark Teli alley at a high speed in a Toyota Karola car, at the same time he lost control of his car and first hit a family on the road

 philhal uski pahchaan police ne kar lee he lekin abhi uski giraftaar nahin hui he
 Police is searching for him
 pakistan aatankwaad kaa samarthan karne vaala desh he, yah uske diene main he
 Terrorism is the biggest and fundamental problem between India and Pakistan
 vah aaj bhi lagaataar aatankwaad kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 This was stated by international strategic affairs expert Farid Zakaria during an exclusive interaction with India Today Group editor-in-chief Arun Puri and TVTN Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kaa aatankwaad ke saath gathjod todna behad kathin he
 Because of this it is extremely difficult to normalize relations between India and Pakistan
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki piem modi shaktishaalee netaa hai
 He should move forward with Pakistan in the same way as US President Richard Nixon in his time with Communist China
 isi tarah mikhail gorbachov ke netritv main soviet sangh ke saath america ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati ronaald reagan ne aage kadam badhaayaa tha
 Alliance for India Necessary Jakaria said that India needs to form a coalition to understand the long-term strategy and play a big role in the emerging geo-political system
 bharat ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki aakhir vah kya karnaa chahta he? use sabase pehle iskaa faisla karnaa chahie
 India sometimes wants to become a global leader, sometimes it wants to focus on development
 jakaaria kaa yah bayaan daavos main world iconomic forum (WEF) main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke us bhaashan ke baad aayaa he, jisamen unhone vaishvikaran (globalization) kaa purajor samarthan kiya tha
 In an exclusive interview with India Today on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zakaria said that now it seems that we are in a time where politics and economy are very different from each other
 videshi maamalon ke jaankaar jakaaria ne kaha ki ham aarthik rup se samakalik vaishvik vikaas ke yug main ji rahe hai
 Today every major region of the world is moving forward, whereas it was not so decades ago
 china ke mukaable bharat kii gati dhimibharat kii vaishvik sthiti ke sawaal par jakaaria ne kaha ki nai vaishvik vyavastha main china ke ubharne ke peeche moolbhoot tathy hai
 China understood its game and planned the strategy accordingly
 ab bharat ko apane powerful padosi china ke mukaable ke liye antarrashtriya agenda kii pahchaan karne kii jarurat he
 Today, India is moving slower than China, while India has more capacity
 lihaaja bharat ko apni kshamta ko pahchaanane kii jarurat he
 Zakaria says that does India want a bigger role internationally without knowing its strategy and goals? Farid Zakaria, who hosted CNN, said that this is an era of rapid drift
 yahaan asahajata bhi zyada he
 He said that i do not understand why India is not wanting to know its game
 daavos main piem modi ke bhaashan main ranneetik sandesh kii kameeindia today group ke editor-in-chif arun puri ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi kii duniya ke netaaon ke saath kootnithik pahal kii tarif bhi kii
 However, he also said that PM Modi could not fully convey India's strategic message to the international community through his speech in Davos
 unke bhaashan main ranneetik sandesh kii kami dikhi, jiskaa saaf matlab yah he ki aapke paas ek bhi ranneeti nahin he
 Zakaria said that India needs to strategize in Asia
 china ke mukaable bharat dhimi gati se aage bad rahaa he, jabaki isaki kshamta zyada he
 Therefore, India needs to recognize its potential and make changes at the ground level
 unhone kaha ki china nirantar apane vikaas or arthvyavastha par focus kar rahaa he
 At the same time, it is completely silent on its foreign policy
 vahiin, rus kaa rukh bilkul alag he
 He goes beyond his capacity and interferes with international policies
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya modi kaa world iconomic forum main udghaatan bhaashan videshi nivesh ko badha saktaa he? jakaaria ne kaha ki piem modi kaarobaar ko lekar behad open hai or sudhaaron ko pesh kiya he, lekin videshi niveshkon ko naukarshahi or license raaj, sarkari bank or adaalaton se nipatna hoga
 He said that just laying the red carpet in Davos will do nothing but change things on the ground
 modi main pakistan ke saath behatar karne kii kshamta he
 
 
 Zakaria said, 'I think Prime Minister Modi has the ability to do something better with Pakistan, which he has not done till now
 unke andar wo karne kii kshamta he jo nicksan ne china daure par kiya tha
 He said that if you remember, Nixon communist countries could go to China and make a deal because he was a staunch anti-communist
 wo kattar dakshinpanthi raajnneetijna the, jo hameshaa itnaa communist virdohi rahe the ki koi bhi unki saakh par sawaal nahin karegaa
 Zakaria said that if Modi tries to do something good with Pakistan, no one is going to attack him for his softness
 or yah vastav main aapasi sambandh ko badalane or upmahadweep ko roopantarit karne kaa ek mauka hoga
 indo-pak trade will be a big win
 He stressed that if India and Pakistan do business together, it will be a big win
 unhone kaha ki kuch vishleshan main maine paaya he ki yah kadam bharat ke jidipi main vruddhi kar saktaa he
 But can India reach a settlement with Pakistan in the presence of a guerrilla-like Pakistani army? Can the Pakistani army be included in the talks or is it diplomatically possible? Zakaria said it could be done
 pakistani sena itani taqatvar he ki baatcheet main koi samasya nahin aegi
 But he also gave the reason why Pakistani army does not want to do this
 wo (paak sena) is game ko chaturaai se khelti he taaki wo sabhi jimmedaariyon se chhutkaaraa paa sake or parde ke peeche se niyantran kar sake
 We had a golden opportunity during Musharraf's tenure
 shaayad, kuch chijen badal sakati thim, ab vah mauka chalaa gaya he
 "all the business of the country is in profit, only the business of the farmer is in loss", says SP Mulayam Singh Yadav

 The SP chief said that unless the farmer of the country is happy, the country cannot become prosperous and great
 samaajawaadee party ke kisaan sammelan main aae pradesh ke ganna kisaan samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar se naaraaz bhi dikhe
 His displeasure was over the fact that while the SP government of the state is not paying his dues of sugarcane, the SP chief is making big promises and claims for the benefit of the farmers

 unka kahana tha ki samaajawaadee party kii niti main kisaanon ko hameshaa praathamikta di jaati hai
 Most farmers have solved the problem of highest unemployment in the country, because 72 percent people of the country have farming, of which 65 percent farmers cultivate themselves

 Highlights of the conversation: Laloo Prasad Yadav has presented five railway budgets

 Profited par aap jo rashtriya netaa hai, uske bare main kam baat karte hai
 Discusses the department we are in
 aap kahalwanaa kya chaahate hai?upie main congress ke baad sabase badi party aap hai
 Whatever happened in Pakistan, Pakistan reacted
 aap muslimon main bhi lokapriy hai, hinduon main bhi
 You are popular in Pakistan
 to kya aapako nahin lagata he ki pakistan ke bare main aapako bad-chadhakar bolnaa chahie tha?jab ek mantri bol rahe hai to usamen sabhi kii sahmati hoti he
 When every minister speaks in a different tone, that is also not a good thing
 jahaan koi mudda galat raah par jaataa he, vahaan main bolta hum
 But whether Lalu ji has any advice to Pakistan right now? My advice to Pakistan is that India wants to live peacefully with its neighbors, especially with Pakistan
 pakistan kii aam avam bhi aatankwaad se grasit he
 Concerns about terrorism have increased in India and around the world
 mumbai main jo aatanki ghatana hui, hamaare jo aarope the saboot ke saath, us par anakani karnaa uchit nahin tha, phir bhi unhone sweekaar kiya he, yah acchhee baat he
 Better late than never
 aap santusht hai, pakistan ne jo kuch abhi tak kiya usase?santusht hai iskaa yah matlab nahin ki aapane sweekaar kiya or ham santusht ho gaye

 Absolutely
 dekhie jo rashtriya partiyaan thim, congress party, baad main aakar bhaajapa
 
 
 Our party too has become a national party
 main bahut nishpaksh rup se kah rahaa hum ki rashtriya partiyon ke vajood ghate hai
 People have different understanding in different states, parties have different grounds to win elections
 rashtriya partiyaan chaahati hai ki in choti-choti partiyon kaa vajood khatm ho jaae
 Not everything is run by the will of the national party
 desh kii janata jo janamat detii he, us par chalanaa padegaa loktantr main
 Do you think their intentions are bad? No intention
 ek chunauti mil gai he inako gathbandhan ke daur main
 Mary Jo is her own Finding
 
 
 
 i do not think that any national party will get a majority
 abhi congress ne kaha ki rashtriya str par upie kii kisi bhi party ke saath gathbandhan nahin karenge?yah charchaa ai thi, par yah sach nahin tha
 Any party, be it Congress, BJP, CPM, if it does not want to join anyone, then there is no coercion
 
 
 agar koi party chaahati he ki sabhi log hamaare binar main rahen, to binar main kaise koi rah saktaa he
 There is an alliance
 gathbandhan he ki sampradayik takaton ko darkinar karo
 The government is needed to save the country
 aise haathon main ham desh ko nahin chhod sakate the, jo babari masjid ko giraate hai, danga- fasaad karte hai, muslim bhaaiyon par vishwaas nahin karte hai
 Then the same melody is being told that we will build the temple
 koun maai kaa laal he jo hamako roak degaa? ham baithe rahenge? ham sab tarah kii qurbaani dekar inako satta ke galiyaaron main nahin aane denge
 You only have a coalition to form a government, why does not a political alliance form? We have a coalition
 gathbandhan rahegaa, jab tak aatankwaad, danga-fasaad rahegaa
 Terrorism, communalism are all twin sisters
 aapke upie main hi log bante hue hai
 Pawar saheb is also talking to Shiv Sena
 jo bhi sampradayikta kaa paala pakadega, uskaa vinaash hoga
 Whether it is Lalu or someone else
 chunaav ke baad gaiyr congressi piem bhi ho saktaa he yaa nahin?kaise nahin ho saktaa he? koi bhi ho saktaa he
 So that includes you? No, we are not included
 lekin hamako ek din bananaa he

 dilli hai court ne somvaar ko apane ek aadesh main cader rivyuu ke baad itibipi main srujit aiji ke padon par deputesan par aane vaale adhikariyon kii nai niyukti par ste laga diya he
 The Division Bench of Justices s Muralidhar and Talwant Singh in the Delhi High Court while hearing a petition of ITBP officials issued this order stating that no appointment in ITBP should be made by deputation until further orders on senior administrative grade
 gyaat ho ki itibipi kaa cader rivyuu 23 disambar 2019 ko kendriya cabinet ne manjuur kiya tha jabaki union cabinet ne hi 3 july 2019 ko kendriya ardhsainik balon ko orgenised cader kaa darja diya tha
 According to the Supreme Court's decision of 5 February 2019, all the central paramilitary forces were considered as Organizations with Organized Cadre
 isi aadhaar par nae sarvice rule banane or padon ko srujit karne kii maang kendriya ardhsainik balon dwaara kii jaati rahi he jabaki 23 oktober ko itibipi ke kader rivyuu main puraane sarvice rules or esaiji par deputesan kii vyavastha ko chaalu rakhaa gaya tha
 Whereas in the event of being an organized cadre, all the posts up to IG rank in any force are required to be filled only by promotion of cadre officers
 isi ke virodh main itibipi ke kai adhikariyon ne adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya jiske alok main hoicourt dwaara antarim aadesh jari karte hue itibipi main aiji rank par kisi bhi prakaar ke deputesan se hone vaali niyukti ko ste ke madhyam se roak diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that in all the Central Paramilitary Forces- Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Sashastra Seema Bal, etc
, there is anger against IPS officers who have been on deputation since many days because these forces will cause their cadre officers Promotion prospects have the opposite effect
 saath hi yah afasar in balon kii gatividhiyon kaa anubhav nahin rakhte or sidhe inhen cmand karne ke liye commander ke taur par padasth kiye jate hai
 In this context, many lawsuits are still pending in the courts

 In his petition, Ashwini Upadhyay had sought to declare Section 2 (c) of the National Minorities Commission Act 1992 unconstitutional
 isi kanoon ke tahate 23 oktober 1993 ko ukt adhyadesh jari kiya gaya tha
 The petition demanded that minority status should not be determined at the national level, but instructions should be made to make rules in view of the population of that community in the state
 upaadhyaay ne alpsankhyakon se jude is adhyadesh ko swasthya, shiksha, awaas jaise moulik adhikaron ke khilaaf bataaya tha
 The petitioner said that Hindus may be a majority at the national level but they are a minority in eight states, so they should be given its status

 Ekta had called Sunny in a promotional event for her web series 'ragini MMS Returns'

 antarrashtriya seemaa or line of control par pakistan jis tareeke se biguef ke javaanon ko sniping ke jariye nishaanaa banane kii koshish main laga rahata he
 With that, BSF always has to be two to four
 biguef is sniping kaa jawaab behatar tareeke se dene ke liye apane kuch commandos ko isroyal ke sniper commandos ke saath training or practice karwaane kaa faisla kiya he
 According to BSF sources, a proposal has also been sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 grih mantralay kii likhit manjuuri milane ke baad biguef kii ek choti team sabase pehle israel jaaegi jahaan par 6 se 11 july ke bich hone vaale sniping compatishan or sniping seminar main bhaag legi
 According to the sources, if everything goes well, then in the coming time, the second team of BSF commandos will be sent to Israel and get special training from the Israeli shooters
 elosi par 145 se zyada paak snipers tainaatajatak ke paas aisi khufia jaankaree he ki pakistan sniping ke jariye BSF ke javaanon ko international border or line of control par nishaanaa banane kii koshish karata rahata he
 In particular, it has deployed trend snipers on its different dops
 khufia sutron ke mutabik paak army or iesai ne line of control or international border par 145 se zyada snipers ko tainaat kiya he
 Pakistan keeps trying to target Indian security forces from time to time through these sharp shooters
 khufia sutron ke mutabik elosi ke us paar paak adhikrut kashmir main pakistan army ne machal (machhal), uri (uri), tangadhaar (tangdhar), poonch (poochh), bimbar gali (bimber Gali), rampur (rampur), krishna ghati (krishna Ghati) or mendhar ke saamne apane khoonkhaar snipers ko tainaat kiya hua he
 Pak gives terrorist snipers in lieu of shooting 1 lakh rupees According to sources, these snipers have been trended with Pakistan's special operation team at the training camp in pok
 jaankaree ke mutabik snipers ke taur par pakistan kii regular army to rahati hi he
 Along with this, terrorists of terrorist organizations Lashkar, Jaish and Hizbul have also been recruited as snipers
 khufia sutron ne ye jaankaree di he ki in snipers ko pakistan kii mujahid batalian ke saath kai jagahon par tainaat kiya
 According to sources, the army of Pakistan also gives 50 thousand to 1 lakh in exchange for shooting these terrorist snipers
 kyon karata he paak snipingpakistan kii khufia agency iesai or pakistan rangers hameshaa international border ke saath-saath line of control se aatankwaadiyon ko bhejne kii firaaq main rahete hai
 Due to this, where the ceasefire violates on the Pakistan International Border and Line of Control, on the other hand, because of the strict surveillance and promptness of the Indian security forces, Pakistan failed to infiltrate the terrorists and used to keep targeting the Indian security forces through its snipers
 is
 bhartiyasurakshablainternational border main alag-alag jagahon par bane mount par tainaat rahete hai, jahaan se vah hand held thermal image ke jariye border par puri nigaraanee to karte hi hai
 Also, because of this vigil, Pakistan is unable to infiltrate terrorists
 aise main border par maujuud BSF or sena ke javaanon ko pakistan sniping ke jariye nishaanaa banaata he
 But now BSF jawans will take special training from sniper commandos of Israel whose aim is as accurate as Arjun
 BSF kii isroyal ke saath is training ke baad pakistan ke sniper kii himmat bhi nahin hogi ki wo BSF ke sniper kii taraf aankh uthaa kar dekh saken

 ek graahak ne kaha ki sharaab kii bottle par is tarah kaa steekar lagaana saraasar galat he
 If it was to be given, then what was the need to give such a picture in which a human is shown sitting with a dog
 darasal, aabkaari vibhaag 'roopalu alirajpur' (sundar alirajpur) naam ke abhiyaan ke tahat stikers ke jariye 'khule main shouch nahin karne' kaa sandesh de rahaa he

 The only aim is to make people aware in any way and to get rid of the problem of defecation in Alirajpur Kokhule

 australian ballebajphil huge kii maut cricket jagatke liye ek sadame kii tarah thi
 Huez's death filled the world with mourning
 lekin huge ke bounsar se chotil hone kii ghatana ke teen din baad hi isroyal ke purv cricketer or ampire hilel auskar kii bhi jabade main gend lagane se maut ho gai
 During a match in the Israeli city of Ashdod, the batsman shot, then the ball hit the front end of the umpiring Oscar
 chot itani jabardast thi ki auskar vahiin gir pade
 He was immediately rushed to the hospital, where he died during treatment
 55 saal ke auskar israeli cricket team ke purv captain the or philhal ampiring karte the
 Hillel's death was reported, but his death did not create a wave of grief on the world stage
 bharat main jitnaphil huge kii maut par afsosjatayaa gaya, shaayad hilel kii maut par nahin
 While Hillel belonged to India
 hilel bhartiya mul ke the or unka taalluk maharashtra se tha
 Hillel's death marked the first time the stir of Israeli cricket was relevant in the Indian media
 isse pehle shaayad hi bahuton ko pataa ho ki isroyal cricket bhi kheltaa he
 The Indian connection to Israeli cricket is historical
 itihaaskaar ramchandra guha ne bhartiya cricket ke itihaas par likhi apni kitaab main bhi iskaa zikr kiya he
 Before proceeding, consider the names of Israeli cricketers
 yephet nagaonkar, aivaishi satamkar, avanar chirekar, moshe chirekar, itmaar kehimkar, yeniv raajpurkar, shifim vaaskar, avanar vaaskar
 These names include Israeli and Indian colors
 khilaadiyon ke upnaam bataa rahe hai ki inke purvaj bharat ke pashchimi tat se isroyal aae the
 Which is also surprisingly home to the legendary Indian Sachin Tendulkar
 guha likhte hai, 'madhya yug kii yahudee birdari ke saath ghulne milane ke baad bhi shaayad unhone apane bhartiya birdarivaalon kii tarah apane mul gaanvon or peshon ko upanaamon kii tarah dhaaran kar liya he
 Kehimkar would actually belong to Kehim and Rajpurkar would have been from Rajpur and so will everyone else
 inamen se bahut se 1960-70 ke dashak main isroyal chale gaye the
 'people of India maintain their identity with them wherever they go
 pravasi bhartiya yahudee desh main cricket ko aage badha rahe hai
 Hillel Oscar was one of them
 rivaaj or paramparaayen ek peedi se duusari peedi ko sthanantarit hoti chali jaati hai
 These are Vaskar and Nagavkar, one of the heroes of cricket in Israel
 unheen vaasakaron or nagavakaron ke pote padpote the jo aadhi sadi pehle bharat se isroyal aa gaye the
 Even in Israel's holy land, the descendants of India, holding the ball and bat in their hands, are becoming the savior of the current cricket generation
 ye sunakar lagata he ki israeli jameen kaa ye tukdaa jo kal ko vishwa cricket kaa mustakabil bhi ho saktaa he, apane andar saalon puraani hindustani aatma ko samete hue aage bad rahaa he
 8 things about Israeli cricket 1
 isroyal kii cricket team non test player deshon main 12wein number par he
 2
 bhugolic rup se madhya purv kaa hissaa hone ke baavjood isroyal kii cricket european cricket council kaa hissaa he
 3

 4
 isroyal kaa cricket se parichay vaise to angrejon ne karaayaa, lekin 1960 tak cricket isroyal main sangharsh karata rahaa
 After this, migrants from South Africa and the Indian continent took cricket forward
 5
 The first cricket league in Israel was formed in 1966, and the Israeli Cricket Association was formed in 1968
 1974 main isisi kii sadsyta pani vaali isroyal ko pakistan kaa virodh jhelana padaa tha
 6
 1979 main israeli cricket team ne isisi trophy main hissaa liya, lekin pehle daur se aage nahin bad saki
 The same happened in 1982 and 86

 Protests go together wherever the Israeli cricket team goes to play
 saal 2000 se isroyal ne europea championships main khelnaa shuru kiya
 In 2006, the team faced heavy protests during the tournament

 The mysterious incident of human organs has been revealed for the last five days in different areas of Alwar city of Rajasthan
 shahar main mahila ke sharir ke tukade kar har jagah daalane vaale psico killer ko police ne giraftaar kar liya he
 The killer is nobody else but the woman's husband
 police hiraasat main usase poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 Police has arrested accused Yogesh Malhotra alias Chuchu from Hisar, Haryana
 usne dhantares kii shaam ko patni aarti devi se jhagade ke baad raat main uski hatya kar di
 After that, putting kerosene oil and set it on fire
 lekin jab shav nahin jala to usne patni ke sharir ke tukade-tukade kar unako thikaane lagaana shuru kar diya
 After this, the accused was monitoring the activities of the police
 police ko bhramit karne ke lieshvake tukdon ko shahar ke duusare sthaan par daalata ja rahaa tha
 On Thursday evening, when the police received information about a woman not appearing for several days from the street of Rangbharyo, when she reached Yogesh's house and started questioning her, she said that the wife has gone to work
 police poochtacha ke baad aaropee apni teen saal kii beti ko lekar faraar ho gaya
 When the police suspects that the police questioned the people of Aspados, they said that the accused has taken something from the house several times in Katta
 iske baad police ne mobile kol ditels ke aadhaar par shuukravaar kii subah aaropee ko haryana ke hisar se giraftaar kar liya he
 In police interrogation, the accused admitted that one of his wife left earlier also
 iske baad usne 25 hajaar rupee main aarti ko kharid kar laayaa

 in sab pahachaanon ke peeche kisaan haank diye jaaenge or phir saare sawaal agle kisi bade sankat tak ke liye sthagit kar diye jaaenge
 There are reports of farmers' loan waiver, but the real game is hidden in the specifics of the conditions of forgiveness
 madhyapradesh main hi jab se kisaan andolan shuru hua he 16 kisaanon kii khudakushi kii khabar he
 However, the Minister of State for Cooperation there is claiming that not a single farmer has committed suicide due to debt
 shukr he unhone yah nahin kaha ki kisaan ne khudakushi nahin kii
 Just said that because of debt
 agar karz ke kaaran khudakushi nahin kii to bhi ek sarkaar kaa farz banataa he ki vah dekhe ki das din ke bheetar 16 kisaanon ke aatmahatya karne kii vajahen kya hai
 The seasonal sensitivity of governments also has an impact on the administration or else the dead body of a farmer for whom he sits on a fast from the Chief Minister to the Minister does not have to take the cot in the auto to take it home after the post-mortem
 aap soch rahe honge ki ambulance kyon nahin diya gaya
 CMO told that many people had come with the deceased farmer, they could not all come in the ambulance, so they did this auto
 siemo ne kaha ki paas kii baat hoti to vyavastha kar dete magar kaaphi dur ke hai
 There is a district hospital in Vidisha and from where the body was brought was not much but only sixty km away
 kair jo log ambulance main nahin aa sakate the wo is auto main aa gaye
 By the way, the Chief Minister had to go to the house of six farmers who were killed by the police bullet, then seven helipads were made, it was rained, so one was used, the Chief Minister went to other places by car
 35 saal ke jivan singh meena vidisha zile ke karaariya thane ke ek gaanv bamaura ke nivasee the
 Was the only child of parents
 somvaar subah unhone faansee lagaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Jeevan had taken a loan of 1
25 lakh from Regional Rural Bank and 3 lakh from Cooperative Bank
 lone nahin chukaa sake to agali buvaai ke liye lone nahin mila, jisase ve khaad or beej nahin kareed sake
 Family members said that they were under stress
 kuch din pehle apni zamin bataaidaar ko di or somvaar ko patni or teen betiyon ko chhod faansee laga lee
 The post mortem report says that Jeevan Singh died due to suffocation ie hanging
 rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report ke anusaar 2015 main madhyapradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 After Jeevan Singh, now the story of Jugraj Singh
 jugraj singh punjab ke bathinda zile ke jhanduke gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 One million was owed to the bank and the commissioners
 jugraj ne aadhati se 24% salanaa byaaj par ek lakh rupaya karz liya tha jo badhkar teen lakh rupee ho gaya tha
 Jugraj was to pay Grameen Bank seven lakh rupees
 usne ek purana tractor bhi liya tha karz par, lekin karz naa chukaa paane ke kaaran tractor bechnaa padaa
 His expectation of loan waiver from the government was lost
 shuukravaar raat wo jab khet se kaam kar waapas aayaa to usne kundi lagaakar cameraa band kiya or faansee laga lee
 Last year he planted cotton in the fields, but the crop had deteriorated
 62 saal kii umr main koi khudakushi kyon karegaa? The Chief Minister of Punjab announced a loan waiver of more than 20,000 crores, but when the budget was presented, the amount of 20,000 crores could not be seen anywhere
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki sabhi chote or haashiye ke kisaanon ke do lakh tak ke lone maaf kar diye jaayenge
 Keep this in mind that farmers have a debt of more than two lakhs
 lone maafee ke baad bhi kisaan lone se mukt nahin ho rahe hai
 Their entire debt is not being forgiven, whereas in election speeches, the entire debt was about forgiveness
 mukhyamantri ne bajet se pehle kaha tha ki das lakh kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 It was claimed that about 56 percent of the farmers would benefit from it
 is hisaab se 21,000 karod kii karz maafee kaa hisaab banataa he, magar bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri manpreet badal ne maatr 1500 karod kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 The Chief Minister said that the loan to the extent of two lakh rupees will be waived off to all marginal farmers, no matter how much they are owed
 agar ise jod len to 30,000 karod ke kareeb hisaab baithta he
 The budget does not say the way the Chief Minister announced before the budget
 yahi nahin paanch acre se adhik zamin vaale kisaanon kaa koi lone maaf nahin hoga
 The Chief Minister also said that the government will repay all the loans of farmers who commit suicide
 khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ko paanch lakh rupee tak kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 If Jugraj Singh was alive till June 20, his loan of one million would not be forgiven under this scheme, now that he is hanged, then perhaps the state government will repay his loan
 punjab sarkaar ne punjab kooparative societes act 1961 ke section 67 e ko bhi radd karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 Now the land of the farmers will neither be auctioned nor seized
 is faisle se kisaanon ko raahat mil sakati he kyonki lone na chukaane par zamin chhin jane kaa dar nahin rahegaa
 Punjab is a developed state in terms of farming
 yahaan har tarah ke buniyadi dhaanche maujuud hai
 Even after this, about 86 percent of the farmers here are under debt
 jitani aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai, unamem se 90 fisadi main ye lone kaaran rahaa he
 Our colleague Nikhil reports that 33 of Punjab
 26 fisadi kisaan garibi rekha se neeche rahete hai
 That is, every third farmer of Punjab is below the poverty line
 maheene main 2500 rupee se bhi kam kamata he
 The average farm family in Punjab owes more than five and a half lakhs
 punjab uniwarsity kii ek report main yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 The director of this project, Dr
 Gyan Singh, says that the ability of marginal farmers, small farmers, semi-small farmers and landless farmers to repay loans has been reduced
 ve chukaa hi nahin sakate hai
 Farmer Pal Singh of Sohna village in Patiala is 55 years old
 vah 2000 maheenaa bhi nahin kama pate hai or karza he aath lakh
 It is clear that Pal Singh's ability to repay the loan has been exhausted
 yahi kaaran he ki kheti se sab palaayan kar rahe hai
 Think about 22000 applications for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana
 wo bhi sthaayee nahin he
 Contract is a job and salary is Rs 8800
 aathvin kii yogyata chahie magar eme kiye hue chaatro ne bhi aavedan kiya he
 Why is this so? aisa isliye he kyonki shaharon main bhi rojgaar nahin he
 Urban economists are speaking daily that people have to be shifted from farming to cities because farming cannot take the weight of 70 percent of the people
 jaise shaharon main rojgaar chappe-chappe par maujuud he
 There is no employment in cities, that is why 70 percent people are dependent on agriculture
 ise aise bhi dekha ja saktaa he, magar baat banane main ham ustad ho chuke hai
 There are two minimum wage rates in Haryana
 318 rupee or 406 rupee
 According to both of them, the peon is getting advertisement for less than minimum wage, that too in the university
 aap soch sakate hai ki nunatam mazaduri kaa bhi kya haal he or rojgaar kaa bhi
 It is a matter of honor that for this reason employment does not become an issue in this country, for this we should thank religious and ethnic issues
 ab aate hai maharashtra kii ore
 On Monday night, there was a discussion between the Maharashtra government group of ministers and farmer leaders about the terms of loan waiver
 kisaan netaaon kaa kahana he ki is baatcheet kaa nateeja nahin niklaa
 They allege that the government is reneging on the promise
 rajya sarkaar ne apane prastaav main kaha ki rajya main 2013 se 2016 ke bich sookhaa rahaa isliye 30 june 2016 tak jo karz liya gaya he usamen se sirf ek lakh maaf kiya jayega
 Farmers who have cars, who pay income tax, who have a government employee in their family, their debt will not be forgiven
 kisaan netaa jis guest house main baatcheet kar rahe the, vahiin par narebaazi karne lage or sarkaar ke prastaav kii pratiyaan jalaane lage
 Maharashtra and Punjab have announced loan waiver, but such conditions have been imposed that this pardon has no special meaning
 zaahir he netaa chunaav main kuch kehete hai, chunaav ke baad kuch or karte hai
 a report by Priyanka Kakodkar appeared in the Times of India on May 18 this year, according to which 852 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra from January to April
 har din saat kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 There have been 409 suicides in Vidarbha

 In Madhya Pradesh too, an average of 1290 farmers are committing suicide every year
 mangalvaar ke indian express main ajay vir jakhad ne likhaa he ki 2015 main kisaanon kii aatmahatya main 42 fisadi kaa izaafaa hua tha
 Not only this, the land is named after a male farmer, but the suicide of female farmers is not included in these figures
 mahila kisaanon ke halaat par to charchaa bhi nahin hoti he
 The comments 4 april 2017 ko hindustan times main devendra sharma ne ek lekh likhaa he
 In this, he has cited the Loklakha Committee of Parliament saying that the NPA of Public Sector Bank is 6 lakh 80 thousand crore
 isamen 70 pratishat difalter udyogpati hai
 Only one percent are farmers
 aap sochiye chaar lakh ke karze vaala kisaan aatmahatya kar letaa he, yahaan pachaas pachaas hazaar karod kaa difalter udyogpati bank adhikariyon ke saath meeting kar rahe hai
 How much time the farmer gets from the bank and an industrialist should be accounted for
 magar kisaanon kii ekmaatr samasya lone nahin he
 The seasonal sensitivity of governments also has an impact on the administration or else the dead body of a farmer for whom he sits on a fast from the Chief Minister to the Minister does not have to take the cot in the auto to take it home after the post-mortem
 aap soch rahe honge ki ambulance kyon nahin diya gaya
 CMO told that many people had come with the deceased farmer, they could not all come in the ambulance, so they did this auto
 siemo ne kaha ki paas kii baat hoti to vyavastha kar dete magar kaaphi dur ke hai
 There is a district hospital in Vidisha and from where the body was brought was not much but only sixty km away
 kair jo log ambulance main nahin aa sakate the wo is auto main aa gaye
 By the way, the Chief Minister had to go to the house of six farmers who were killed by the police bullet, then seven helipads were made, it was rained, so one was used, the Chief Minister went to other places by car
 35 saal ke jivan singh meena vidisha zile ke karaariya thane ke ek gaanv bamaura ke nivasee the
 Was the only child of parents
 somvaar subah unhone faansee lagaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Jeevan had taken a loan of 1
25 lakh from Regional Rural Bank and 3 lakh from Cooperative Bank
 lone nahin chukaa sake to agali buvaai ke liye lone nahin mila, jisase ve khaad or beej nahin kareed sake
 Family members said that they were under stress
 kuch din pehle apni zamin bataaidaar ko di or somvaar ko patni or teen betiyon ko chhod faansee laga lee
 The post mortem report says that Jeevan Singh died due to suffocation ie hanging
 rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report ke anusaar 2015 main madhyapradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 After Jeevan Singh, now the story of Jugraj Singh
 jugraj singh punjab ke bathinda zile ke jhanduke gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 One million was owed to the bank and the commissioners
 jugraj ne aadhati se 24% salanaa byaaj par ek lakh rupaya karz liya tha jo badhkar teen lakh rupee ho gaya tha
 Jugraj was to pay Grameen Bank seven lakh rupees
 usne ek purana tractor bhi liya tha karz par, lekin karz naa chukaa paane ke kaaran tractor bechnaa padaa
 His expectation of loan waiver from the government was lost
 shuukravaar raat wo jab khet se kaam kar waapas aayaa to usne kundi lagaakar cameraa band kiya or faansee laga lee
 Last year he planted cotton in the fields, but the crop had deteriorated
 62 saal kii umr main koi khudakushi kyon karegaa? The Chief Minister of Punjab announced a loan waiver of more than 20,000 crores, but when the budget was presented, the amount of 20,000 crores could not be seen anywhere
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki sabhi chote or haashiye ke kisaanon ke do lakh tak ke lone maaf kar diye jaayenge
 Keep this in mind that farmers have a debt of more than two lakhs
 lone maafee ke baad bhi kisaan lone se mukt nahin ho rahe hai
 Their entire debt is not being forgiven, whereas in election speeches, the entire debt was about forgiveness
 mukhyamantri ne bajet se pehle kaha tha ki das lakh kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 It was claimed that about 56 percent of the farmers would benefit from it
 is hisaab se 21,000 karod kii karz maafee kaa hisaab banataa he, magar bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri manpreet badal ne maatr 1500 karod kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 The Chief Minister said that the loan to the extent of two lakh rupees will be waived off to all marginal farmers, no matter how much they are owed
 agar ise jod len to 30,000 karod ke kareeb hisaab baithta he
 The budget does not say the way the Chief Minister announced before the budget
 yahi nahin paanch acre se adhik zamin vaale kisaanon kaa koi lone maaf nahin hoga
 The Chief Minister also said that the government will repay all the loans of farmers who commit suicide
 khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ko paanch lakh rupee tak kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 If Jugraj Singh was alive till June 20, his loan of one million would not be forgiven under this scheme, now that he is hanged, then perhaps the state government will repay his loan
 punjab sarkaar ne punjab kooparative societes act 1961 ke section 67 e ko bhi radd karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 Now the land of the farmers will neither be auctioned nor seized
 is faisle se kisaanon ko raahat mil sakati he kyonki lone na chukaane par zamin chhin jane kaa dar nahin rahegaa
 Punjab is a developed state in terms of farming
 yahaan har tarah ke buniyadi dhaanche maujuud hai
 Even after this, about 86 percent of the farmers here are under debt
 jitani aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai, unamem se 90 fisadi main ye lone kaaran rahaa he
 Our colleague Nikhil reports that 33 of Punjab
 26 fisadi kisaan garibi rekha se neeche rahete hai
 That is, every third farmer of Punjab is below the poverty line
 maheene main 2500 rupee se bhi kam kamata he
 The average farm family in Punjab owes more than five and a half lakhs
 punjab uniwarsity kii ek report main yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 The director of this project, Dr
 Gyan Singh, says that the ability of marginal farmers, small farmers, semi-small farmers and landless farmers to repay loans has been reduced
 ve chukaa hi nahin sakate hai
 Farmer Pal Singh of Sohna village in Patiala is 55 years old
 vah 2000 maheenaa bhi nahin kama pate hai or karza he aath lakh
 It is clear that Pal Singh's ability to repay the loan has been exhausted
 yahi kaaran he ki kheti se sab palaayan kar rahe hai
 Think about 22000 applications for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana
 wo bhi sthaayee nahin he
 Contract is a job and salary is Rs 8800
 aathvin kii yogyata chahie magar eme kiye hue chaatro ne bhi aavedan kiya he
 Why is this so? aisa isliye he kyonki shaharon main bhi rojgaar nahin he
 Urban economists are speaking daily that people have to be shifted from farming to cities because farming cannot take the weight of 70 percent of the people
 jaise shaharon main rojgaar chappe-chappe par maujuud he
 There is no employment in cities, that is why 70 percent people are dependent on agriculture
 ise aise bhi dekha ja saktaa he, magar baat banane main ham ustad ho chuke hai
 There are two minimum wage rates in Haryana
 318 rupee or 406 rupee
 According to both of them, the peon is getting advertisement for less than minimum wage, that too in the university
 aap soch sakate hai ki nunatam mazaduri kaa bhi kya haal he or rojgaar kaa bhi
 It is a matter of honor that for this reason employment does not become an issue in this country, for this we should thank religious and ethnic issues
 ab aate hai maharashtra kii ore
 On Monday night, there was a discussion between the Maharashtra government group of ministers and farmer leaders about the terms of loan waiver
 kisaan netaaon kaa kahana he ki is baatcheet kaa nateeja nahin niklaa
 They allege that the government is reneging on the promise
 rajya sarkaar ne apane prastaav main kaha ki rajya main 2013 se 2016 ke bich sookhaa rahaa isliye 30 june 2016 tak jo karz liya gaya he usamen se sirf ek lakh maaf kiya jayega
 Farmers who have cars, who pay income tax, who have a government employee in their family, their debt will not be forgiven
 kisaan netaa jis guest house main baatcheet kar rahe the, vahiin par narebaazi karne lage or sarkaar ke prastaav kii pratiyaan jalaane lage
 Maharashtra and Punjab have announced loan waiver, but such conditions have been imposed that this pardon has no special meaning
 zaahir he netaa chunaav main kuch kehete hai, chunaav ke baad kuch or karte hai
 a report by Priyanka Kakodkar appeared in the Times of India on May 18 this year, according to which 852 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra from January to April

 In Madhya Pradesh too, an average of 1290 farmers are committing suicide every year
 mangalvaar ke indian express main ajay vir jakhad ne likhaa he ki 2015 main kisaanon kii aatmahatya main 42 fisadi kaa izaafaa hua tha
 Not only this, the land is named after a male farmer, but the suicide of female farmers is not included in these figures
 mahila kisaanon ke halaat par to charchaa bhi nahin hoti he
 The comments 4 april 2017 ko hindustan times main devendra sharma ne ek lekh likhaa he
 In this, he has cited the Loklakha Committee of Parliament saying that the NPA of Public Sector Bank is 6 lakh 80 thousand crore

 35-year-old Jeevan Singh Meena was a resident of Bamaura, a village in Karia police station in Vidisha district
 maa-baap kii iklauti santan the
 He committed suicide by hanging himself on Monday morning
 jivan ne kshetreey gramin bank se sava lakh or sahakaari bank se teen lakh lone liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, he could not get a loan for the next sowing, so that he could not buy fertilizer and seeds

 According to the report of National Crime Branch Bureau, in 2015, 581 farmers committed suicide in Madhya Pradesh
 jivan singh ke baad ab jugraj singh kii kahani
 Jugraj Singh was a resident of Jhanduk village in Bathinda district of Punjab
 unke upar bank or aadhat waalon kaa das lakh bakaayaa ho gaya tha
 Jugraj had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh at the rate of interest of 24% per annum which had increased to Rs 3 lakh
 jugraj ko gramin bank kaa saat lakh rupaya chukaana tha
 He had also taken an old tractor on loan, but had to sell the tractor due to failure to repay the loan
 sarkaar se karz maafi kii uski ummid tut chuki thi
 When he returned from work on the farm on Friday night, he closed the room with a latch and hanged it
 beete saal usne kheton main kapaas lagaai thi lekin fasal karaab ho gai thi
 Why would someone commit suicide at the age of 62? punjab ke mukhyamantri ne 20,000 karod se adhik kii karz maafee kaa elaan kiya lekin jab bajet pesh hua to usamen kahin 20,000 karod kii raashi hi nazar nahin ai
 The Chief Minister had said that loans of up to two lakhs of all small and marginal farmers will be forgiven
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhiyegaa ki kisaanon par do lakh se adhik kaa karz he
 Even after loan waiver, farmers are not getting rid of loan
 unka puraa karz maaf nahin ho rahaa he, jabaki chunavi bhaashanon main sampurna karz maafee kii baat karte the
 The Chief Minister said before the budget that ten lakh farmers will be benefited
 daawa tha ki kareeb 56 fisadi kisaanon ko isse phayda hoga
 Accordingly, a loan waiver of 21,000 crore is made, but Finance Minister Manpreet Badal has made a provision of only 1500 crore while presenting the budget
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sabhi seemaant kisaanon ko puure do lakh rupee tak kii karz maaf kar di jaaegi chaahe un par kitna bhi karz kyon na ho
 If you add it, then it accounts for close to 30,000 crores
 bajet main us tarah se nahin kaha gaya he jaise bajet se pehle mukhyamantri ne elaan kiya tha
 Not only this, no loan will be waived for farmers with more than five acres of land
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ke jitne bhi lone baaki honge, wo sarkaar chukaayegi
 Financial assistance of up to five lakh rupees will be given to the farmers who commit suicide
 jugraj singh agar 20 june tak zindaa hote to unka das lakh kaa karz is yojana ke tahat maaf nahin hota, ab faansee laga lee he to shaayad rajya sarkaar unka lone chukaa degi
 The Punjab government has also decided to repeal section 67A of the Punjab Cooperative Societies Act 1961
 ab kisaanon kii zamin na to nilaam hogi or na zabt
 This decision can provide relief to the farmers as there will be no fear of losing the land if they do not repay the loan
 punjab kheti ke lihaaz se ek viksit rajya he
 Every type of infrastructure is available here
 iske baad bhi yahaan ke kareeb 86 fisadi kisaan karz se dabe hai
 Of all the suicides that have taken place, this loan has been the reason for 90%

 For example, in cities, employment exists on a whim

 Farmer leaders say that this conversation did not yield results
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar vaade se mukar rahi he
 The state government said in its proposal that the state remained dry between 2013 and 2016, so only one lakh will be waived out of the loan taken till June 30, 2016
 jin kisaanon ke paas car he, jo inakam tex bharte hai, jinke parivaar main koi sarkari karmchaaree he, unka karz maaf nahin hoga
 At the guest house where the farmer leaders were talking, they started shouting slogans and burning copies of the government's proposal
 maharashtra or punjab ne karz maafee kaa elaan to kar diya, magar itani sharten laga di gayi hai ki is maafee kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 Obviously leaders say something in elections, they do something else after elections

 The Punjab government has also decided to repeal section 67A of the Punjab Cooperative Societies Act 1961

 Now come towards Maharashtra
 somvaar raat maharashtra sarkaar ke mantriyon ke samooh or kisaan netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui ki karz maafee kii sharten kya hongi
 Farmer leaders say that this conversation did not yield results
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar vaade se mukar rahi he
 The state government said in its proposal that the state remained dry between 2013 and 2016, so only one lakh will be waived out of the loan taken till June 30, 2016
 jin kisaanon ke paas car he, jo inakam tex bharte hai, jinke parivaar main koi sarkari karmchaaree he, unka karz maaf nahin hoga
 At the guest house where the farmer leaders were talking, they started shouting slogans and burning copies of the government's proposal
 maharashtra or punjab ne karz maafee kaa elaan to kar diya, magar itani sharten laga di gayi hai ki is maafee kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 Obviously leaders say something in elections, they do something else after elections
 is saal 18 may ke times of india main priyanka kakodakar kii ek report chhapi he, jiske anusaar maharashtra main janvari se lekar april tak 852 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Seven farmers have committed suicide every day
 409 aatmahatyaayein vidarbha main hui hai
 In 2016, 1023 farmers committed suicide during this period
 chaar maheene main 852 kisaan aatmahatya kar len, kya aapako aisi khabaren vichlit karti hai
 On May 3, 2017, the government affidavit in the Supreme that more than 12,000 farmers have committed suicide on an average every year since 2013 in the field of agriculture, despite considerable efforts
 madhyapradesh main bhi har saal ausatan 1290 kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 In Tuesday's Indian Express, Ajay Vir Jakhar has written that in 2015, there was a 42% increase in farmer suicides
 yahi nahin zamin purush kisaan ke naam hoti he magar mahila kisaanon kii aatmahatya ko in aankadon main shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 The situation of women farmers is not even discussed
 tippaniyan On 4 April 2017, Devendra Sharma has written an article in Hindustan Times
 isamen unhone sansad kii loklekha samiti kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki public sector bank kaa enpie chah lakh 80 hazaar karod kaa he
 70 percent of the defaulters are industrialists
 maatr ek fisadi kisaan hai
 You think a farmer with a debt of four lakh commits suicide, here the defaulter industrialist of fifty fifty thousand crore is meeting with bank officials
 kisaan ko bank se kitna vakt miltaa he or ek udyogpati ko isi kaa hisaab nikaala janaa chahie
 But loans are not the only problem of farmers
 punjab ke mukhyamantri ne 20,000 karod se adhik kii karz maafee kaa elaan kiya lekin jab bajet pesh hua to usamen kahin 20,000 karod kii raashi hi nazar nahin ai
 The Chief Minister had said that loans of up to two lakhs of all small and marginal farmers will be forgiven
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhiyegaa ki kisaanon par do lakh se adhik kaa karz he
 Even after loan waiver, farmers are not getting rid of loan
 unka puraa karz maaf nahin ho rahaa he, jabaki chunavi bhaashanon main sampurna karz maafee kii baat karte the
 The Chief Minister said before the budget that ten lakh farmers will be benefited
 daawa tha ki kareeb 56 fisadi kisaanon ko isse phayda hoga
 Accordingly, a loan waiver of 21,000 crore is made, but Finance Minister Manpreet Badal has made a provision of only 1500 crore while presenting the budget
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sabhi seemaant kisaanon ko puure do lakh rupee tak kii karz maaf kar di jaaegi chaahe un par kitna bhi karz kyon na ho
 If you add it, then it accounts for close to 30,000 crores
 bajet main us tarah se nahin kaha gaya he jaise bajet se pehle mukhyamantri ne elaan kiya tha
 Not only this, no loan will be waived for farmers with more than five acres of land
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ke jitne bhi lone baaki honge, wo sarkaar chukaayegi
 Financial assistance of up to five lakh rupees will be given to the farmers who commit suicide
 jugraj singh agar 20 june tak zindaa hote to unka das lakh kaa karz is yojana ke tahat maaf nahin hota, ab faansee laga lee he to shaayad rajya sarkaar unka lone chukaa degi

 But loans are not the only problem of farmers
 mukhyamantri ne bajet se pehle kaha tha ki das lakh kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 It was claimed that about 56 percent of the farmers would benefit from it
 is hisaab se 21,000 karod kii karz maafee kaa hisaab banataa he, magar bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri manpreet badal ne maatr 1500 karod kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 The Chief Minister said that the loan to the extent of two lakh rupees will be waived off to all marginal farmers, no matter how much they are owed
 agar ise jod len to 30,000 karod ke kareeb hisaab baithta he
 The budget does not say the way the Chief Minister announced before the budget
 yahi nahin paanch acre se adhik zamin vaale kisaanon kaa koi lone maaf nahin hoga
 The Chief Minister also said that the government will repay all the loans of farmers who commit suicide
 khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ko paanch lakh rupee tak kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 If Jugraj Singh was alive till June 20, his loan of one million would not be forgiven under this scheme, now that he is hanged, then perhaps the state government will repay his loan
 punjab sarkaar ne punjab kooparative societes act 1961 ke section 67 e ko bhi radd karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 Now the land of the farmers will neither be auctioned nor seized
 is faisle se kisaanon ko raahat mil sakati he kyonki lone na chukaane par zamin chhin jane kaa dar nahin rahegaa
 Punjab is a developed state in terms of farming
 yahaan har tarah ke buniyadi dhaanche maujuud hai
 Even after this, about 86 percent of the farmers here are under debt
 jitani aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai, unamem se 90 fisadi main ye lone kaaran rahaa he
 Our colleague Nikhil reports that 33 of Punjab
 26 fisadi kisaan garibi rekha se neeche rahete hai
 That is, every third farmer of Punjab is below the poverty line
 maheene main 2500 rupee se bhi kam kamata he
 The average farm family in Punjab owes more than five and a half lakhs
 punjab uniwarsity kii ek report main yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 The director of this project, Dr
 Gyan Singh, says that the ability of marginal farmers, small farmers, semi-small farmers and landless farmers to repay loans has been reduced
 ve chukaa hi nahin sakate hai
 Farmer Pal Singh of Sohna village in Patiala is 55 years old
 vah 2000 maheenaa bhi nahin kama pate hai or karza he aath lakh
 It is clear that Pal Singh's ability to repay the loan has been exhausted
 yahi kaaran he ki kheti se sab palaayan kar rahe hai
 Think about 22000 applications for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana
 wo bhi sthaayee nahin he
 Contract is a job and salary is Rs 8800
 aathvin kii yogyata chahie magar eme kiye hue chaatro ne bhi aavedan kiya he
 Why is this so? aisa isliye he kyonki shaharon main bhi rojgaar nahin he
 Urban economists are speaking daily that people have to be shifted from farming to cities because farming cannot take the weight of 70 percent of the people
 jaise shaharon main rojgaar chappe-chappe par maujuud he
 There is no employment in cities, that is why 70 percent people are dependent on agriculture
 ise aise bhi dekha ja saktaa he, magar baat banane main ham ustad ho chuke hai
 There are two minimum wage rates in Haryana
 318 rupee or 406 rupee
 According to both of them, the peon is getting advertisement for less than minimum wage, that too in the university
 aap soch sakate hai ki nunatam mazaduri kaa bhi kya haal he or rojgaar kaa bhi
 It is a matter of honor that for this reason employment does not become an issue in this country, for this we should thank religious and ethnic issues

 kantrect kii naukari he or selary he 8800 rupee
 Eighth qualification is required but the students who have done MA have also applied

 shahari arthshaastri rose bol rahe hai ki logon ko kheti se hataakar shaharon main bhejnaa hoga kyonki kheti 70 fisadi logon kaa bhaar nahin uthaa sakati
 For example, in cities, employment exists on a whim

 One day when Amitabh Bachchan came there for shooting, the entire office turned towards the studio
 adhikari tak apane cabin se baahar nikal aae amitabh bachchan kii ek jhalak paane ke liye
 This small incident before the Mumbai attack explains why Amitabh Bachchan has become an idiom for acting
 filmi duniya main dashakon bitaa chuke amitabh bachchan ko bhi anya kalakaaron kii tarah us daur main chote parade se parhez tha jab tivi nayaa-nayaa aayaa tha
 But look at the amazing small screen that when Amitabh Bachchan's career came down the slope, TV gave him a lifeline
 tab tak ye engri main super kool ho chukaa tha
 Amitabh is known in public as an intelligent and cultured actor
 amitabh ko sin karnaa aaj bhi nirmaataaon kii chahat he
 Perhaps this will be the first artist to be seen by four generations on screen and he is still active
 varna chaar pidiyon ne naam to anek kalakaaron kaa suna he lekin sakriy taur par unhen dekha nahin he
 From Rajiv Gandhi to Narendra Modi, he will probably be the only artist (lata Mangeshkar is a singer) to have a social experience
 tab ham primary skool main padhate rahe honge jab amitabh bachchan kii kuli ai thi or unka accident hua tha
 Then there was talk of Amitabh's health everywhere
 har shahar main vishesh puja-paath hue the unki salaamati ke liye
 Till the time he came out of danger, Amitabh Bachchan used to discuss about tea shops, houses, offices in every street
 ek abhinayta kii sehat ko lekar janata ke bich itani shiddat se phikr kaa doosraa udhaaharan nahin dekhne ko mila
 Amitabh Bachchan's first film we saw on the video - Sholaye disappeared from school
 ye isliye dekhi thi ki sahpaathee sholay kii bahut charchaa karte the or ham kuch dost mahasoos karte the ki sholay nahin dekhi to jindagi bekaar he
 This is why i saw this film
 inaki laal badshaah or tufaan tip kii filmein bhi dekhin lekin jameen nahin
 In the new era, Amitabh did better story films in which Piku and Shamitabh came out completely different
 shamitabh ek bilkul alag kahani thi jiske aas-paas bhi koi duusari film nahin bani
 However, Amitabh's fans are living in this era too
 na jane kitnon ne unke dialog kii nakal shauk main kii or phir wo unki aajeevika kaa saadhan ban gaya
 Some of them became famous and some were not
 amitabh ke kapadon or dadhi kii nakal karne vaale aaj bhi har saarvajanik sthaan par aasaani se dikh jaaenge
 However, this artist is happy to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award but it seems that he got it for a while
 *** Amid escalating tensions with China at the border in Sikkim, the central government has for the first time begun an in-depth analysis of Chinese foreign investment in India's neighboring countries

 This will also include the investment being made under the Belt and Road Initiative
 belt and road inishiative ko van belt van road yaa obioar naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The $ 50 billion CPEC project, given its strategic interests, has raised concerns over China's One Belt One Road policy
 50 billian dollar kaa china-pakistan iconomic corndor pakistan adhikrut kashmir se hokar gujarata he
 The central government will also analyze the nature and impact of Chinese investment in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
 iske saath hi afghanistan or maldive main chini nivesh kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jayega

 haalanki shiyanaliyang is baat se inkaar karte hai ki van belt van road project kaa koi ranneetik yaa raajnneetik makasad he
 The report says that India does not believe in China's explanation that China's One Belt One Road project is running for economic purposes only
 iesees ke sampadak pi

 suryanarayan kaa kahana he ki china-pakistan aarthik coridor kaa ranneetik makasad hai
 Many projects being built in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the New Delhi situation, the National Security and Defense Service think tank United Service Institution of India (USI) believes that as far as India's concerns are concerned, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor has made the subject complicated
 
 is project ke tahat bharat kii sahmati ke bina pakistan adhikrut kashmir main kai project ban rahe hai or yahi cheez is project ko raajnneetik rup se mahatvapurn bana detii he
 Pakistan's debt will be heavy to repay! USI study says if China is for economic development of Pakistan Economic Corridor and One Belt One Road project area then China should reconsider it and withdraw investment from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir needed
 yuasai kaa aage kahana he ki die gaye samay ke bheetar pakistan ke liye china-pakistan aarthik coridor ke nivesh ko chukaa paanaa sambhav nahin lagata
 In such a situation, this loan will become a strategic part of China, especially Gwadar Port

 In his mother's love, Munawar is so sure that he has said that if India and Pakistan are to reunite, the Prime Ministers of the two countries should meet with their respective mothers

 dilli ke saath hi desh bhar main loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan is baar badi gadabadi kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Preparation is to stop the functioning of the Election Commission directly and that too through an attack in which the attacker is not visible
 hamalavar bhi desh ke nahin balki baahar ke hai, masalan khadi deshon or uttar korea sarike deshon ke
 If votes are to be held in Delhi, then one such shadow will be pursuing the whole process, which no one can see
 ji haa, khatra he sibar atake kaa
 Well-known hackers of many countries are desperate to spread this time in the election website of other states including Delhi
 chunaav ayog ko mili khufia jaankaree ke mutabik is baar sabase zyada khatra khadi deshon main baithe havers se he, uttari korea sareekhe deshon main bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 However, the Election Commission is showing itself ready to fight against all these threats
 dilli ke mukhya chunaav adhikari vijay dev ne kaha, ‘hamane har kism ke hamalon ke liye puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 In fact, the Election Commission is also sleepy because on December 4 last year, when voting was going on for the Delhi Assembly, the search engine of the Delhi Election Office was hacked by someone
 tab voting ke vakt kaam thapp pad gaya tha
 The responsibility of investigation in this entire case was entrusted to NTRO, the country's largest agency on these matters
 sutron kii maane to ye sari karstani china main baithe hue havers kii ho sakati he
 But this time, many countries are preparing for disturbances, so the Election Commission has installed fire walls in the website along with special equipment
 lekin jaankaar bataate hai ki ye sab kaaphi nahin he
 Cyber expert Pawan Duggal said, 'hackers are very active at the moment and laws to deal with them are very low
 ’chunaav ayog ne sirf takneekee taiyaari nahin kii he, balki website kaa back ap website bhi taiyaar kiya he
 For example, the website of Delhi will be kept as a back up in any other state, so that work can continue even during disturbances

 iske pehle bhi hamaare superstar kii superhit film toilet ek prem katha soshal ishyu par besd thi
 In the new look seen in the poster, Akki is seen carrying a sanitary napkin in her hands in a formal look
 yah luk movie kii kahani or iske sandesh ko damdaar tareeke pregent karata dikhaai de rahaa he
 The background look of the poster clearly states that the scene has been shot abroad

 It has a very interesting caption, Saprahero hai pagla hai
 akshay kumaar ne kharide 4 lagjri flats, har ek kii keemat karodon rupaposter main akshay ruiyon ke dher par khadey najar aae the
 If you look at both the posters, they are seen to tell the story
 pehle poster main rui ke dher par khadey akshay duusare poster main sanetary ko bana lene kii safal muskaan ke saath najar aa rahe hai; India's picture has come to light in terms of ease of doing business
 isse jahaan modi sarkaar ko notebandi kii saalagirah ke maukey par utsav manaane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 On the other hand, it can also bring better results for the economy
 visheshgyon kii maane to yah bharat ko kai phaayde dilaa saktaa he
 This includes many things including increasing employment and foreign investment
 vishwa bank ne kaha iconomi ke liye sabit hoga phydemandavishwa bank ke adhyakshaanet dikson ne kaha he ki jab bhi kisi desh kii vyapaar sugamawa ke maamle main ranking sudharti he, to iskaa sidhaa phayda vahaan kii arthvyavastha ko miltaa he
 In an interview given to The Hindu, he said that this not only benefits smes, but also increases employment
 smes hongi majbootadikson ne kahaaki vyapaar sugamawa ranking sudharne kaa phayda smes ko sabase zyada hoga
 According to him, there are some smes in India in which only 6 people work
 vyapaar sugamawa main behatar ranking kaa matlab he inke liye bijness karnaa aasaan hona
 Small businessmen will get benefit According to the decision, small businessmen get direct benefit of improving the ranking
 darasal ranking sudharna is taraf ishaara karata he ki desh main kaarobaar ke liye maahaul saral ho rahaa he
 This environment makes it easier for small businessmen to do their business
 isse unka vyapaar bhi badhata he
 The economy benefits from that
 badhege rojgarbharat main chote kaarobaariyon kii kaaphi zyada sankhya he
 In such a situation, employment will also increase in the country due to the promotion of small and medium scale industries
 dikson bhi kehete hai ki esemai ke majboot hone kaa phayda desh main rojgaar ke maukey badhane ke taur par milegaa
 Nisha Desai Biswal, head of the US India Business Council, said that India is going in the right direction
 unke mutabik bijens ranking sudharne se bharat ko kaaphi phayda hoga
 He told PTI that this would increase direct foreign investment in India
 kam hoga pratirodhunhone kaha ki pratyaksh videshi nivesh- epadiai pani kii tarah hota he
 According to him, where investors see ease of investing, they drift away
 niveshkon ko kam pratirodh pasand hota he
 Investors want new opportunitiesbiswal said that new opportunities need to be prepared for the growth of the economy
 iske liye videshi nivesh jaruri hota he
 Economy also grows as foreign investment increases
 arthvyavastha kaa vikaas hone kaa matlab he ki nae niveshak isse judenge
 The international trade fair in Delhi was not very good due to demonetisation, but as people started getting cash, the trade fair started getting crowded
 antim dinon main meley main record bheed dekhne ko mili
 However, if you talk about the traders, this time the traders looked very disappointed, the traders said that this time the sale was half of each time
 pichley 20 varshon se tredfare main dukaan laga rahe woodkar ji bole ki unki dukandaaree main is baar behad giravat rahi, bikri lagbhag aadhi hi rahi
 Similarly, masalavyaparivijay has been putting up his shop in this fair for the last 7 years, but according to him, this time people had such a problem of currency that their sales fell by 70 percent
 inke mutabik log dekhne to aa rahe hai lekin kharid nahin rahe
 Those who have stalled for the first and second time at the fair have lost their cost but then the profit is not as expected
 vahiin amravati ke chuudi vyapaaree javed kaa bhi yahaan doosraa saal hai lekin note bandi ne unhen bhi niraash hi kiya hai
 It is worth mentioning that the people of Kittredfair are waiting all year round, but this time the demonetisation that took place just before the fair has affected the business and number of visitors of the fair much more than the previous time
