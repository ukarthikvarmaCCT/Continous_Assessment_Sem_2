 An FIR has been filed against Akshay Kumar in Mumbai's Vakola police station, in which wife Twinkle and the organizer of Fashion Week have also been named
 inke khilaaf dhara 294 (34 ) lagaai gai he jo gairajamaanti he, yani ab jamaanat ke liye adaalat main arji lagaani hogi
 The officer who lodged the FIR is Anil Nair

 However, the police did not take their complaint easily, first they were satisfied, then the FIR was written
 vaise is maamle main akshay pehle hi maafee bhi maang chuke hai
 Akshay said that he did not want to hurt the feelings of the people and what happened was very bad
 vaise bhi akshay kumaar ke chehre se hansi to pehle hi kafoor thi
 They did not even recover from the situation of China from Chandni Chowk
 vaise is vakt akshay kumaar mumbai main nahin hai
 It is reported that he is in South Africa, so it is difficult for him to defend himself
 vankhede stadium main shanivaar ko hone vaala vishwa cap kaa final muqabla kai lihaaj se ahm hoga
 Firstly, for the first time in World Cup history, two Asian teams will clash in the final and the second will be the last World Cup match of world cricket spinner Muttiah Muralitharan
 is match ke baad muralidharan antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas le lenge
 Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar also retired after the semi-final match against India
 isaki kuch khaas charchaa nahin hui, lekin muralidharan kaa agle vishwa cap main nahin khelnaa cricket premiyon ko behad khalegaa
 Muralitharan retired from this mode after losing the 800th wicket in Tests and soon after that Murali had said that he would retire from odis after this World Cup
 srilankai captain kumaar sangakaara ne kaha he ki unki team test maichon main 800 or ekadivasiy maichon main 534 wicket lene vaale is champion gendbaaj ke liye khitaab jeetne kaa prayaas karegi
 On the other hand, it will probably be the last World Cup for the 36-year-old Sachin, but he will be active in international cricket even further
 murali se ulat sachin ko ab tak is baat kaa malaal he ki vishwa cricket ke ballebaaji ke tamaam record apane naam karne ke baavjood unhen ab bhi vishwa cap trophy kii kami khal rahi he
 Murali's case is different from this, as he was a member of the 1996 World Cup winning team
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni or unke sabhi saathi chahenge ki ve sachin ko vishwa cap kii samaapti tak yah tohfa den or isi lihaaj se final match ke rochak or romaanchak hone kii ummid he
 Two Asian teams will reach the finals for the first time and would like to bid farewell to each of their great players from the World Cup
 sachin ke liye yah match ek or vajah se khaas he
 He has scored 99 international centuries so far
 mohali main vah 15 ranon se shatak se chook gaye the, lekin agar unka 100waan shatak mumbai main lagata he or uski madad se bharat khitaab jeetta he, to yah bhartiya cricket prashansakon or khud sachin ke liye kisi sapane ke sach hone se kam nahin hoga
 The BJP has prepared a roadmap for elections to be held later this year in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh
 party ke liye ahm in dono rajyon main sanghathan ko majboot kiya jayega
 At the same time, a separate strategy to connect Congress rebels and dissidents with the BJP will also be worked out
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa ne isi tarah kii ranneeti uttarapradesh,uttarakhand,goa or manipur main lagu kii thi
 Now the BJP is preparing to extend this policy
 asantushton ko dhudhon or bhaajapa main laombhajapa ke sutara bataate he ki party kaa sheersh netritv ne in donon rajyon main congress se naaraaz chal rahe netaaon or hashie main chal rahe netaaon ko chinhit kar netaaon se samvaad shuru karne kii ranneeti tay kii he
 Under this, the BJP will explain to the disgruntled leaders that they will not be able to make their future by staying in the Congress
 saath hi congress main na to unka bhavishya banane or unki kshamtaaon kaa yogya istemaal karne kii takat bachi he
 Local leaders of Gujarat and Himachal will contact these dissidents and try to talk to the BJP president about these leaders when needed
 vipaksh ke bade netaaon ko saadhane or party main daakhil karaane kii jimmendaari pradesh adhyaksh, pradesh prabharee or sanghathan mahaamantri nibhaayenge
 The strategy of the election of five states will further increase
 The bjp's assessment is that by creating a stampede in the pre-election party, the central leadership of the opposition party will focus its attention on leaving the election preparations to the leaders
 isse vah manovaigyanik ladai main haar jaaenga
 From June 1 to August 14, there will be a program to convince opposition leaders and from August 16 to November, there will be a program to join the BJP
 bhaajapa kii ranneeti sintabar se har hafte vipaksh ke kisi netaa ko bhaajapa main shaamil karnaa he
 More than half of the mlas will cut the ticket, BJP will be targeted on the existing mlas in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh on the lines of MCD elections in Delhi
 in vidhayakon ko badalakar nae chehre laane kii planning he
 According to the report received by the party high command, this will help ease the resentment of the MLA in public
 narendra modi isse pehle bhi gujarat main ye prayog karte aae hai
 There will also be a question of prestige for the Gujarat party because of the fact that no one could fill the place of Narendra Modi after becoming Prime Minister
 saath hi netritv parivartan ke baad bhi khud amit shah or sangh pramukh ko rajya par nazar rakhni padi
 Constantly, the Sangh sent its top leaders on a state visit and met with a lot of people and prepared a feedback report which mentioned all those shortcomings
 party is report ko aage kii ranneeti kaa hissaa banaaegi
 This does not remove the power that has been in hand for 11 years
 kuch aisa hi himachal pradesh main bhi hoga jahaan congress kaa bhrashtachar mukhya mudda hoga

 Because when the party loses in Karnataka, they have a toothache
 vaise to wo hameshaa dikhaate hai ki desh ke dard se dukhi hai

 BIGGBOSS12 (@biggboss12info) on Nov 4, 2018 at 7:09pm PSTA post shared by Bigg Boss 12 (@bigg_boss_s12) on Nov 4, 2018 at 6:48pm PST Since 2013, the Bharatiya Janata Party has been fighting and winning elections in the name of Narendra Modi
 chaahe wo aam chunaav rahe hon, yaa phir rajyon ke chunaav, cheharaa bas ek hai- modi
 And this sequence continues
 rajyon main bhi mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaaron ke sahare koi chunaav nahin ladaa gaya
 He may be in the campaign, but the name remains Modi
 modi hi apni party or prachaartantr ke bahubali hai
 The rest are side actors
 aam chunaav ke liye jab pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par sitambar 2013 main narendra modi ke naam ko tay kiya gaya, tab se lekar march 2014 tak modi ne deshbhar main 475 badi-choti reliyaan kin
 Apart from this, he also appeared in discussions on 3D addresses and tea
 inaki taadaad bhi 5350 he
 However, the influence of Modi also builds and accumulates when they are present in physical meetings
 janata se sidhe samvaad kaa vikalp chaay par charchaa nahin ban sakati or na hi thri-di sambodhan
 Perhaps this is why Modi did not try this method in the 2014 elections
 iske baad modi nau rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye avatarit hote rahe
 He did more than 125 big rallies
 isamen sarvaadhik reliyaan kin bihar main, sabase kam jammu-kashmir or uttarakhand main
 These efforts of Modi paid off and except for a few states, today the BJP is seen in power almost all over India
 ek chehre vaali party kaa sankatane vaale dinon main chunaav bhale hi gujarat or himachal pradesh main he, par isaki sargarmi puure desh main mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, in view of the current political climate in his home state of Gujarat, Modi can hold 50 rallies before the assembly elections
 is varsh janvari se abtak wo 10 baar gujarat ja chuke hai
 He will also go to Himachal and it will start from the General Assembly on October 29
 yani har morche or har chunaav kaa cheharaa ek hi hai- modi
 Since becoming Prime Minister, Modi has been consistently saying that a lot of time and money of the country is spent in elections held at different times of the states and the center
 unhone suzav diya he ki rajyon kaa chunaav or centre main sarkaar chunane ke liye matdaan ekasaath hone chahie
 Even if this advice of Prime Minister Modi is accepted, then he himself is going to live in the highest poverty and loss
 isaki ekmaatr vajah he ek chehre vaali raajnneeti or prachaar vyavastha
 Modi is the face of his party
 rajyon ke muddon se lekar centre kii nitiyon tak har chunaav main modi hi vipakshiyon ko takkar dete hai
 If there is an attempt to get the states and the center elections together, Modi will have to hold thousands of rallies and public meetings in all parts of the country
 yaad kiijie ki kaise wo bihar ke ek-ek jile main pahunch rahe the
 He was seen doing road shows in Uttar Pradesh
 banaras main deraa daalkar baithe
 People from different parts of Maharashtra were seen explaining and agreeing on their issues
 aisa agar sabhi rajyon or centre sarkaar ke chunaav ke liye karnaa pade to akele modi se yah sambhav nahin ho paaegaa
 It will be impossible for him as Prime Minister
 sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj or itane saare rajyon kaa daura karne main modi apni hi party or prachaar ko wo samay or mahatv nahin de paaenge jo wo abhi de paa rahe hai
 In such a situation, Modi's own idea may prove to be the most expensive for him

 sutron ne jaankaree di he ki is mulaakaat main courian ne suryanelli gangrape cese main khud par lag rahe aaropon ko lekar safai di he
 After this meeting, speculation has intensified that resignation from Kurian may be sought, though according to Congress sources, a formal decision is yet to be taken
 haalanki courian ne sonia gandhi ke saath apni kareeb 20 minute kii mulaakaat ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin di
 When asked if there was a possibility of his resignation from the post of Deputy Chairman of the Upper House, he said, i will not comment

 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya ucch sadan ke upasabhapati ke pad se unke istife kii sambhaavna he, to unhone kaha, main tippanee nahin karunga
 i will not say anything about the conversation i had with the Congress President
 yah media ke liye nahin he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki pije courian ne istife kii maangon ke bich do din pehle sonia gandhi or rajyasabha ke sabhapati hamid ansaari ko khat likhakar aaropon se inkaar kiya tha
 Kurien is said to have told Ansari that the charges against him are political conspiracies

 Harendra Singh, the coach of the Indian junior hockey team that won the eighth junior Asia Cup after defeating Pakistan, said on Monday that it was just the beginning and players would have to go through a 'hard test' against European teams to figure themselves out
 bharat ne ravivaar ko malaysia ke kuantan main chir pratidwandvi pakistan ko final main 6-2 se harakarajunior asia kapahockey khitaab jeeta
 a year and a half ago, Harendra, who became the coach of the junior team, told Kuantan, "it is just the beginning of the winning process
 hamaare pradarshan main din pratidin nikhaar aa rahaa he or is jeet ke baad main aashwast hum kijunior hockeyke liye jo rodmap hamane taiyaar kiya he, ham sahi disha main ja rahe hai
 However, he said that Indian junior players will have to play more matches than European teams like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands to get themselves absorbed
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen sirf toornamenton par nahin balki sheersh tiimon ke khilaaf maichon par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 i would like that next year we play more matches against big European teams like Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, England to get a chance to judge ourselves
 in khilaadiyon ko us ‘hard test’ ke dabaav se guzarana jaruri he
 Asked about the importance of the victory in the Asia Cup, Harendra said that this could give India a more or less easy group in the Junior Hockey World Cup to be held on their soil next year
 unhone kaha, ‘upmahadwipiya champion ke rup main world cap main utarane se team kaa manobal to badhegaa hi, saath hi group main ek yaa do aasaan timen milane kii bhi sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 This win will prove important when the grouping is decided in the World Cup
 ’ junior hockey world cap agle saal 1 se 11 disambar tak dilli main khelaa jayega
 Refusing to give the credit of the win to a particular player, the coach said that every win comes from team efforts and he will not allow the trend to give importance to individual performance
 harendra ne kaha, ‘meraa hameshaa se maananaa rahaa he ki hockey main har jeet team prayaas kii dein hoti he
 i never value individual sports nor allow my team to give
 jeet kaa shrey puri team ko jaataa he
 When asked about the specific strategy before the final match against Pakistan, he said that he had taught the players to play without pressure like a normal match
 unhone kaha, ‘maine match se pehle dressing room main pakistani team ke bare main koi baat nahin kii
 i asked the players to play it like a normal match and show their natural game
 maine unhen kamiyon ko durust karne ke bare main bhi kaha lekin yathartwaadee lakshya die

 khud mulaayam singh yadav ne party main saare netaaon se kaha he ki wo party kii rajat jayanti samaaroh ko bhavy tareeke se manaane kaa intjaam karen
 The responsibility of celebrating the silver jubilee has been entrusted to the controversial minister Gayatri Prajapati, who was thrown out of his cabinet by Akhilesh Yadav

 After the sixth nuclear test of North Korea, China has undoubtedly been reprimanding it by uniting the whole world, but the reality is that China and North Korea have some separate and special relationship
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki north korea or america aae din ek-duusare ko dekh lene kii dhamkee to dete hai, lekin donon ko is baat kaa ahsaas bhi he ki china kii surat main unke darmyaan ek aisi diwaar khadi he, jise paar kar ek-duusare se bhid paanaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's argument is North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un on one side, then the mighty country President Donald Trump
 donon ek duusare ko aamane-saamne se dekhe bina hi is kadar nafrat karne lage hai ki lagata he ek duusare par hamalaa kiye bina chaiyn kii saans nahin lenge
 Donald Trump has been threatening Kim for a long time
 lekin is nae parmaanu pareekshan ne jaise north korea par america kii tyoriyaan or chadha di hai, jabaki kim ne bhi kasam kha rakhi he ki wo america dweep goam ko barbaad karke dam legaa
 In such a situation, after the sixth nuclear test, China is the only country whose eyes are fixed on the whole world
 north korea par china kaa rukhtrump ko bhi ye pataa he ki jab tak china he, tab tak north korea par america hamalaa nahin kar saktaa
 The reason is that not only is China's economic partnership and friendship with North Korea, but a confrontation with North Korea can also become a reason for conflict with China
 ye or baat he ki is parmaanu pareekshan ke baad china ne bhi apane saajhedaar north korea ko aade haathon liya he or sabar se kaam lene kii taakid kii he
 This treaty is between Washington and Beijing
 If the US invades North Korea, then it may have to take it because in the event of war, China will have to support North Korea in the recent times, because both the US and North Korea There are treaties of China together
 1950 se lekar 1953 tak north or south korea ke bich chali jang main china or rus ne uttar korea kaa saath diya tha
 After which the war was over with a ceasefire treaty mediated by the UN
 is sandhi ke dauraan washington or beijing ke bich ek samjhauta ye bhi hua tha ki agar america bhavishya main north korea par hamalaa karata he to sij fire tut jayega
 Apart from this treaty between North Korea and China, in 1961, the left-wing governments of China and North Korea entered into another important treaty
 iskaa naam ‘china-uttar korian parsparik sahaayta or sahyog mitrataa sandhi’ tha
 The treaty states that if China and North Korea attack any other country, the two countries will have to cooperate with each other immediately
 pichley varshon main in donon deshon ne is sandhi kii vaidhata kii avadhi badhaakar 2021 tak kar di he
 Some foreign affairs experts say that both countries have benefited greatly from this treaty, where China has satisfied its business interests, while North Korea has managed to secure itself further by making this treaty
 uttar korian bazaar main china kaa rajaarthik najariye se bhi china ke lienorth koriabahut zyada ahm he
 China has been ruling the North Korean market for the last four decades
 iske alaava america senaaon kii is kshetra main maujuudagi ne bhi china ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he or isiilie wo jald is samasya ko hal karnaa chahta he
 China is constantly trying to somehow end the situation of war
 isliye chini videsh mantri ne america or uttar korea donon ko hi chetate hue kaha tha ki agar yuddh hua to usamen jeet kisi kii nahin hogi, jabaki donon ko kabhi naa dur hone vaale jakhm jhelane pad sakate hai
 What will be the role of China? But now in China, there is a strong awareness that what will be the role of China in the event of war
 sarkari akhbaar global times ke mutabik agar america north korea ke khilaaf satta parivartan ke iraade se hamalaa karata he to china ko chup nahin rahanaa chahie

 agar unki partner acchhee nahin lag rahi hai, to jabardastee unhen khubasurat bolne kii jarurat nahin he or na hi ye bolne kii jarurat he ki ab wo pehle jaisi khubasurat nahin rahi
 3
 mahilaayein bed main tabhi parfect hongi jab unka din acha jayega
 She will never enjoy sex with words that are rude, angry, and irritating
 4
 Sex is not a serious activity
 kai purush sex ke dauraan ekadam gambhir ho jate hai
 They neither laugh nor romantic
 antarang palon ke dauraan lite mood main rahen, apane partner ke saath annjvoy karen
 5
 sex ke pehle forple bahut jaruri he
 Many women enjoy it more
 6
 Women love to romance, hold hands, fill in arms
 kai mahilaon kii shikaayat hoti he ki unka partner ye sab sirf forple ke dauraan hi karata he
 7
 sex ke baad mahilaon ko partner ke saath baat karnaa acha lagata he, lekin bahut si mahilaon kii shikaayat hoti he ki unka partner sex ke turant baad so jaataa he
 So keep this in mind and do not let them feel like this

 There is a discussion in political circles that along with SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav Mainpuri can also contest Lok Sabha elections from Azamgarh seat
 aisa purvanchal main sapa ke paksh main maahaul banane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 However, state Public Works Minister and Mulayam Singh's brother Shivpal Singh Yadav says that at present there is no proposal for Netaji to contest from Azamgarh, as will be seen
 azamgarh se mulaayam ke loksabhaa chunaav ladane kii charchaa tab shuru hui thi jab aktubar 2013 main azamgarh main sapa ne 'desh bachaao-desh banaao' raily kii shuruyaat kii
 Through this big rally in terms of crowd, SP started campaigning in the state
 is raily main purvanchal ke kai jilon ke log shaamil hue the
 Anyway, the SP chief has an old attachment with Azamgarh
 ve kehete rahe hai ki itawa ke baad azamgarh unka doosraa ghar he
 Of the 10 assembly seats falling in the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency, nine belong to the SP MLA
 jab se narendra modi ke varanasi se chunaav ladane kii charchaa tej hui he, tabhi se sapa main mulaayam singh ko varanasi se chunaav maidan main utaarne kii kavayad tej ho gai he
 To reduce Modi's 'influence', some leaders of the East Zone want Mulayam Singh to fight Azamgarh to reduce Modi's influence
 philhal azamgarh se bijepi ke ramakant yadav saansad hai
 SP has made Havildar Singh its candidate for the Lok Sabha elections
 sapaayiyon kii soch he ki mulaayam ko azamgarh se chunaav ladaane par na keval ramakant ko haraana aasaan ho jayega balki aasapaas kii kai siton par bhi party ko phayda milegaa

 The film is directed by Om Raut

 Apart from this, there is also talk of Kajol being cast in the film
 agar aisa hota he to lambey vakt baad kaajol or ajay devgan kii jodi parde par saath najar aegi
 Apart from this film, Ajay Devgan is coming with the film De De Pyar De on 17 May
 ye film ek kamedi drama he
 Earlier Ajay Devgan's film Total Dhamaal came in the cinema halls
 film ne box offis par shandaar collection kiya tha
 Inflation increased and the bus increased
 taaja ghatana main dilli sarkaar ne 173 saamaanon par waite kii dar 4 fisadi se badhaakar 5 fisadi kar di he
 The government expects a total revenue of over Rs 500 crore
 ab dit bhi mahangaa ho gaya he
 This means that all the claims and promises were kept in the loop, but inflation did not come under control
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir naakaami kii vajah kya he
 The merge continued to grow, as did medicine
 mahangaai par sarkaar kaa yahi haal rahaa
 Now that inflation is beyond its capacity, the government is unable to give anything except promises and claims
 pehle daawa kiya gaya ki antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii keemten badhin, uskaa asar mahangaai par padaa
 Now oil prices are at the bottom, but inflation remains the same
 phir kaha gaya ki kharaab monsoon ne keemton ko badhaayaa
 But the truth is that there was a buffer stock for the last three years
 is baar pehle se kadam nahin uthaae gaye
 The government's excuse number three - cheap anaja was distributed from the ration shop
 sachai yah he ki keval 20 fisadi log rashan kii dukaan se saamaan le pate hai
 Excuse number four - Only black marketing was banned
 lekin sachai yah he ki khuleam ho rahi he kalabazari
 Pretend number five - The open import of sugar and lentils was allowed
 lekin isamen bhi phayda sirf mil maalikon or vyapaariyon ko hua
 No effect on price
 jaahir he sarkaar kii bolti band hogi hi
 Not only this, the government kept making repeated statements that there would be shortage of food grains this year and these statements raised the prices further
 kul milakar sarkaar bayaan to detii rahi
 But the reality on the ground did not change
 buudhvaar ko mumbai main ek event main purv sibiefasi chif pehlaaj nihaalani ne 'padmavati' vivaad or 'juli 2' kii asafalataa par baat kii
 He said that 'padmavati' should have got the certificate by now
 padmavati ke bare main unhone kaha- padmavati ko certificate jarur milanaa chahie kyonki aaj sibiefasi or uske har sadsy par dabaav he
 Nowadays we are just reading about Padmavati
 din bhar log padmavati kii hi charchaa kar rahe hai
 It is being written in every newspaper
 mere khyaal se yah samiti ke sabhi sadasyon par asar daalega or wo alag maansikta ke saath apni ankhen kholenge
 Shatrughan Sinha was honored by the Karni Sena for opposing Padmavati
 It is sad
 sibiefasi ko pehle hi faisla le lenaa chahie tha
 If they have to give a certificate to the film, then they should have given it in advance and if not, then they should have already refused
 keval chunaav kii vajah se padmavati par vivaad, ravina boleen- sab thik ho jayegaapako bataa den ki film 'juli 2' ko pehlaaj ne distribute kiya tha
 The film was badly beaten at the box-office
 film ke bare main baat karte hue unhone kaha- film buree tarah flop hui
 We could not recover the money for the film

 com / x4ycbrbaxs soshal media par bijepi se pichhadgaye ke baad congress ne twitor par jubaan par chadhgaye vaale shabd ke saath diya jawaab
 This is considered to be the beginning of Congress' online strategy for the 2014 elections
 nai dilli main narendra modi ke do jagahon par bhaashan se do din pehle 6 april ko congress ke new soshal media se jude thinkatank (vichaarkon) ne ek teleconference kii
 In this, there was a deep churn on how to rein in Modi's growing online influence
 isamen modi ke liye ek aisa upnaam talashne par jor tha jo chota, mjedaar evam aasaani se yaad karne laayak ho or jisase yah dikhaane kaa unka iraadaa bhi puraa ho sake ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaa bhaashan jhooth, arddh satya or kori bayaanbaji se sarabor hota he
 After summarily discussing several idioms like 'modi is living (modi is a liar)' and 'modi stop lying (modi stop lying)', finally a young member of Delhi who joined his group suggested 'feku' The agreement was reached
 is charchaa main shaamil samooh ke ek sadsy ne naam na jaahir karne kii shart par india today ko bataaya, 'yah ekadam sateek shabd tha
 This word was also quite interesting and it is a word that we all know well in India
 har offis or parivaar main kai yaa ek feku (dingen haankane vaala) hota he
 The # Feku tweet trend began in India just minutes after Modi's speech at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Ladies Organization (FLO) began and it soon peaked at number one and by then Remained at the top, until the game was called off
 dopaher main kareeb ek ghante tak to yah duniya bhar main twitor kaa top trend bana rahaa
 This sidelined the pro-bjp # modistormsficci tweet and most importantly, the Congress threw a tremendous trump card in response to the # pappucii campaign
 isse pehle 4 april ko kanfederation of indian industry (siiai) main rahul gandhi ke bhaashan ke baad bijepi samarthakon ne twitor par pappu abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 Sanjay Jha, a member of the Congress social media group, says, "this time we decided to smash the BJP with his weapon because it has been used to pay money and spew venom from people with multiple accounts
 hamaare swayamsevakon ke ek chote-se samooh ne twitor par # Feku post kiya
 Soon it gained momentum and spread around the world
 ' sutron kaa kahana he ki congress ne agle loksabhaa chunaav tak isi model par ‘javaabi hamale’ karne kaa faisla kar liya he jisamen bijepi kii nitiyon or modi par khaas taur se hamalaa hoga
 Many people are unhappy that this battle of # Feku vs # Pappu has made social media as insignificant as the IPL contest, but the fact is that it is quite interesting because of three points in the 2014 election race

 pehla, pehali baar aisa hua he ki bijepi mukhyalay 11 ashok road se sanchalit or party ke majboot maane jane vaale information technology cell ko hathiyaar daalane pade hai
 Due to its strong team of 100 people spread in 25 states of the country, BJP felt that social media is such a platform on which it has an unchallenged hold
 is cell ke rashtriya pramukh arvind gupta kehete hai, 'yah to ekadam saaf he ki is abhiyaan ko congress ne bahari logon kii madad se anjaam diya he
 It does not matter
 ise kal hi bhula diya jayega kyonki yah modi ke bhaashan par hone vaali swaabhaavik pratikriya ke virodh main purv niojit gadhi hui bhaavana thi
 In contrast, he claimed that people working in the BJP cell are emotionally attached to the party
 unka kahana he ki soshal media par dakshinpanthi bhaavana or bijepi kaa online andolan itnaa majboot he ki use aisi ‘tuchh tikadam’ kii badaulat patari se nahin utaara ja saktaa
 BJP supporters tried to show Rahul Gandhi the same status by reversing the hashtag and for some time he also got some success, but by then the tag had actually stuck with Modi
 doosraa, yah congress kii soshal media ranneeti kii anadhikarik laanching thi
 Preparations have been in place since February and it is being run under the supervision of a 10-member committee headed by Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh
 # Feku abhiyaan par aadhikarik muhar tab lag gai jab samiti ke sadsy sanjay jha ne 8 april ko dopaher 1
 Tweeted at 28: # teamcongress, thanks to Narendra Modi for best title forever; # Feku! Wow sir !!! This was just as BJP encouraged the # pappucii campaign, which is clearly evident from Arvind Gupta's tweet on April 4: # pappucii did not talk about the 'vadra model' of entrepreneurship during the last recession How to make billions
 # rgcii'twitor se india today ko mili pusht aankadon ke mutabik 9 april tak # pappucii ke 40,200 twit or # Feku ke 45,700 twit ho chuke the
 But in their peak days (pappu April 4 and Feku April 8) the # Feku hashtag outnumbered the # pappucii of 18,616 hashtags with a number of 39,071
 teesraa, congress ke soshal media abhiyaan par jor ke saath hi upie sarkaar ke digital media plan ko bhi aage badhaayaa gaya he jise pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheja gaya he
 This indicates that a party which once used to consider Twitter and Facebook as a noisy, stupid idiot has finally become serious about using its power
 pradhanmantri ko bheje gaye pramukh sujhaavon main kaha gaya he: soochna evam prasaaran mantralay (iandbi) main ek new media wing banaaya jaae jo soochnaaon ke online prasaaran kaa kaam dekhe
 Until the other ministries make their own arrangements, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting should act as a hub for providing information and gathering feedback; Create a think tank of professionals who advise the government about social media; And it has also been suggested in the plan not to sanction any additional posts or finances in various existing departments of ministries, but to employ young, online friendly professionals from different ministries
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ne bataaya, 'ham 21veen sadi kii ladaai 1950 ke dashak ke films divijan or photo jaise sadhano se lard rahe hai
 Now the time has come to be modern
 ' unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar madhyasth kii jarurat ko kam karne ke siddhant par kaam kar rahi he
 It believes that giving such news directly is of great benefit as it does not have editorialization like independent newspapers, websites or TV channels
 ''is baar hamane bijepi ko usee ke hathiyaar se dharashayi karne kaa faisla kiya kyonki vah mehtaanaa dekar jehar ugalvaane kaa kaam karti ai he
 '- Sanjay Jha, Member, Congress Social Media Group Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari says,' There is a need to create a direct communication medium with the people
 technology bahut aage bad chuki he or sarkaar ne yah samaj liya he ki use iske saath kadamtal kerani hogi
 However, he declined to provide further details
 lekin trinmul congress ke netaa derexo bryan kaa kahana he ki agar koi bhi online abhiyaan, chaahe vah congress kaa ho yaa bijepi kaa, # Feku banaam # pappucii jaise keechad oochaal abhiyaan main badal jaataa he to donon pakshon ko iskaa koi phayda nahin milegaa
 Trinamool Congress chief whip and Member of Parliament o Brien said that such competition reduces politics into a "hashtag spectacle"
 unka kahana he, 'soshal media ke peeche kii soch kuch kehane se zyada sunne kii honi chahie
 But this is turning into an opportunity to show what jersey you are wearing
 racing kii bhashaa main kahen to isse galat vyakti ke prashansak taiyaar hote hai
 From the outside it seems that two horses are running, but a third horse comes and takes the bet
 ' trinmul ekmaatr aisi kshetreey party he jisaki ek samuchit online ranneeti he, vah fasebuk evam twitor par sakriy he or bijepi ke yuva itivi kii tarj par vah apana internet tivi chounal laane kii taiyaari main he
 'this is something that will be forgotten tomorrow because it is a fabricated idea to oppose Modi's speech
 ’- arvind gupta, pramukh, bijepi information technology selek baat kii chintaa in sabhi partiyon ko he, or # Feku tathaa # pappucii jaise rochak shabdon kii talash main hone vaale manthan satron main bhi yah baat pramukhataa se chai rahi ki koi bhi yah bhavishyavaanee nahin kar saktaa ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon par twitor, fasebuk or utyub par bani dharanaon kaa kya asar hoga
 These will be the first Lok Sabha elections after the massive presence of these platforms, at least in urban India

 Till now, in the name of flexi fare or dynamic fair, railway passengers are charging more than the actual price of the ticket
 vahiin ab rail mantri piyush goyal ne shuukravaar ko flixi kiraaye main puri tarah se sudhaar karne ke sanket die hai

 goyal ke anusaar bhartiya railway bhihotalonor vimaanan companiyon kii tarj par tikat booking par chhot dene kii taiyaari main he
 Under this, if the train is not fully booked, the railways can give ticket discounts like airlines and hotels
 aapako bataa den ki hotel or airlines companiyaan bhiflexi kirayeka istemaal karti hai
 In such a situation, due to lack of customers, these companies reduce the room rent or air fair, so that they do not suffer loss and the number of customers also increases due to cheap rent
 ab railway ne bhi is tarah kii koshish par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Goyal's remarks came after the formation of a six-member committee to review the flexi rental scheme
 varisht adhikariyon ke ek divasiy sammelan ke baad goyal ne kaha, "railway, vimaanan company or hotalon ke dianmik prising praaroop kaa adhyayan kar rahaa he
 We are discussing Dynamic Pricing Policy
 abhi tak hamaara dhyaan keemten na badhen is par tha, lekin main isse aage janaa chahta hum
 i am looking for the possibility that if the seats of the train are not filled, then fares like air carriers can be given concession
 "goyal ne kaha, "ham isamen air india ke siemdi rahe or vartmaan main indian railway board ke adhyaksh ashvini lohani kii visheshgyata kaa istemaal karenge
 Many hotels in the country also have dynamic pricing
 sabase pehle keemten kam, phir baad main keemten badhati jaati he or baad main bache kuch kamaron par book maay hotel or anya websiton ke madhyam se chhot kii peshkash hoti he
 "he also raised the question of why the flexi fares were only for the increase in the price of train tickets

 mahila ranger or sab diviginal officer ke liye nikaali gai bhartiyon main state PSC ne mahilaon ke liye chaati 5 centimetre phulanaa anivaary kar diya he
 Just like it is mandatory for men in the army and police to sew
 PSC ne is niyam ko lagu karte samay yah daleel di thi ki jab samvidhan ke saamne purush or mahilaayein samaan hai to physical test bhi saamaanya hone chahie
 Now when the state PSC removed the recruitment, the women of the state are beating their heads
 haalanki is niyam ko lekar rajya mahila ayog ne PSC ko kadi fatkaar lagaai he or saat din ke bheetar is niyam ko lekar jawaab maanga he
 State Women's Commission chairperson Harshita Pandey has said that this rule has been imposed on women without any solid reason

 According to him, there is a natural distinction between man and woman on the physical parameters

 Girls preparing for competition with this rule, instead of studying and writing, are trying to figure out how to inflate the chest up to five centimeters and what will be the scale of its measurement
 PSC ke is qualification ko lekar ye ladkiyaan pareshaan hai
 However, many women's groups and women's social organizations have come out in support of him
 ve is niyam ko lekar PSC ko aade haathon le rahi hai
 In addition to the educational qualification, the rule of inflating the chest up to five centimeters is neither in the parametrimtree forces nor in any other service

 Women's organizations have warned the PSC that if they decided not to remove this rule and start the recruitment process afresh, they would agitate against it across the state
