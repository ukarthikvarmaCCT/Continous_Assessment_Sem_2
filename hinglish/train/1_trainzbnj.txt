 com / qv5mun908e While addressing a gathering in Hyderabad, Owaisi also attacked the BJP
 ovaisi ne kaha ki mere musalmaan hone par shaayad tumhen shaq hoga ki ye vafaadaar he yaa anti neshnal , magar suno meri ek baat ko
 If the BJP is saying that my booth is the strongest, then i am saying that my border is strong and my country is strong

 bataa den ki pulavama main hue aatanki hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the, jisaki jimmedaari aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee he
 Asaduddin Owaisi had said that 'this attack has a link with Pakistan
 pakistani sarkaar, pakistani sena or iesai kii yojana ke anusaar is hamale ko anjaam diya gaya
 He said that the people who have killed and claimed responsibility for 40 of our soldiers are jaish-e-mohammad and not jaish-e-shaitan
 ' unhone aage kaha ki 'mohammad kaa sainik kisi vyakti kii hatya nahin karata, vah maanavtaa ke prati dayaalu he
 You are jaish-e-shaitan, jaish-e-iblis
 majood ajahar, tum moulana nahin hai, tum shaitan ke shishy ho
 It is not lashkar-e-taiba, it is lashkar-e-shaitan
 'darasal, 14 farvari ko siarpief kaa kafila jammu se srinagar ja rahaa tha
 The convoy had about 78 vehicles and 2500 personnel

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Rahul is adopting an aggressive attitude, going everywhere, interacting with the people and also with the media
 pehle yahi rahul media ko dekhte hi bhaag khad hote the
 Rahul went on vacation, i have not been able to find out where he has been yet, only kept speculating but it has been good wherever he went
 iskaa phayda congress ko mila he
 Whether in Parliament or outside, Rahul has made such an attack that people are now talking
 alam yah he ki wo sarkaar par hamalaa karte hai or sarkaar apana bachaav karti he
 Ministers have to reply on behalf of the government
 maahaul hi kuch aisa ban gaya he ki rahul kisaanon kii baat karte hue is sarkaar ko sootboot kii sarkaar sabit karne main kuch had tak safal rahe hai
 First listen to Rahul's speech, it was written
 magar ab wo taiyaari kar ke aate hai or bolte hai
 Earlier there was no communication with the front crowd, now they have started happening, jumle has started speaking
 enesyuai ke adhiveshan main bhi rahul apane rang main dikhe
 Quipped on the Prime Minister's foreign visits and also told the people when Manmohan Singh went to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bakaul rahul gandhi, manmohan singh or modi ji ne desh kii arthvyavastha par charchaa kii
 This meeting also became important because Manmohan Singh had made a sharp comment on the Modi government's economy
 manmohan singh ne is sarkaar kii mek in india kii hawa nikaalte hue kaha ki yah unheen kii sarkaar kii niti he or keval naam nayaa he
 Then Manmohan Singh said that the concern of the Governor of the Reserve Bank and advisor to the Finance Minister is justified for this economy, it also needs attention
 ab jab manmohan singh jaisaa vyakti desh kii arthvyavastha par bole to use gambhirtha se lenaa hi samajhadaari he
 And perhaps the Prime Minister did well by calling him
 tippaniyan In fact, after the completion of one year of the Modi government, the Congress has given a good competition under the strategy
 rahul ne jab ek rank ek pension par sena ke ritaryad logon se mulaakaat kii to sarkaar harakat main ai
 Now it seems that something might happen in this case
 ek ladaai amethi main bhi chal rahi he jahaan priyanka ne morcha sambhaal rakhaa he
 Now the challenge for Rahul Gandhi is how much change he can make in the party
 kyonki kisaan, majdoor or akaliyat kii baat karne vaali party kaa charitra bada hi samantvaadi he
 Only Gandhi family is talking about them, where are the other Congressmen? logon ko is baat main bhi dilchaspee hogi ki rahul kii team main koun koun se log honge
 Initially, Rahul has corrected it, but whether he is able to take it to the end, we will all have our eyes on it
 iskaa phayda congress ko mila he

 pehle rahul kaa bhaashan suniye, likhaa hua hota tha
 But now they come prepared and speak
 pehle saamne kii bheed se samvaad nahin hota tha, ab wo bhi hone laga he, jumale bolne lage hai
 Rahul was also seen in his color at the NSUI session
 pradhanmantri kii videsh yatraaon par chutki lee or logon ko yah bhi bataaya ki manmohan singh pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane kab gaye
 Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Modi ji discussed the economy of the country
 yah mulaakaat isliye bhi mahatvarpun ho gai kyonki manmohan singh ne modi sarkaar kii arthvyavastha par tikhi tippanee kii thi
 Manmohan Singh, while airing the make in India of this government, said that this is the policy of his government and only the name is new
 phir manmohan singh ne kaha ki rirjav bank ke garvanar or vitt mantri ke salaahkaar kii chintaa is arthvyavastha ke liye jaij he us par bhi dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Now when a man like Manmohan Singh speaks on the country's economy, it is prudent to take it seriously
 or shaayad pradhanmantri ne unhen bula kar acha hi kiya
 The comments darasal modi sarkaar ke ek saal puure hone par congress ne ranneeti ke tahat acchhee takkar di he
 The government swung into action when Rahul met the retired army men on a rank one pension
 ab lagata he ki is maamle main shaayad kuch ho jaae
 a fight is also going on in Amethi where Priyanka has taken charge
 ab rahul gandhi ke liye chunauti he ki wo party main kya karte hai kitna badlaav laa pate hai
 Because the character of the party talking about farmers, laborers and the Akaliyat is very feudalistic
 inaki baat keval gandhi parivaar hi kar rahaa he baaki congressi kahaan hai
 People will also be interested in which people will be in Rahul's team
 shuruyaat to rahul ne thik kii he magar kya wo ise anjaam tak le ja pate hai, isi par ham sab kii nigahen hongi

 hiskool ke antim saal menjab unhone america itihaas padhaa, to unhone aaazaad mulk kii kalpana ke liye america ko hi apana adarsh sweekaar liya
 When his family returned from Crimea, he enrolled in the University of Petrograd to study philosophy and history
 1924 main snaatak hone ke baad unhone har baat ko jaanane kii aazaadee ko khatm hote dekha or yah bhi ki dhire-dhire uniwarsity par communist thagon kaa raaj ho gaya

 net / bhale hi mahagathbandhan main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar abhi koi saaf sthiti nahi bani he, lekin argedy ne loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar apni taiyaari tej kar di he
 The party decided in the meeting of the Central Parliamentary Board on Saturday that all decisions related to the Lok Sabha elections will be taken by RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav
 yani mahagathbandhan main siton ke bantwaare se lekar argedy ke ummidavaaron ke chayan main antim muhar lalu prasad yadav kii lagegi
 National spokesperson of RJD and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said that all decisions related to elections will be taken by Lalu Prasad Yadav
 haalanki lalu prasad yadav chaara ghotaale maamle main sajayaftaa he or ranchi ke hotwar jail ke kaidi hai
 He is currently undergoing treatment at RIMS Hospital in Ranchi
 mana ja rahaa he ki mahagathbandhan main koun party kitne siton par ladegi, iskaa faisla lalu yadav hi karenge
 Anyway, all party leaders of the grand alliance are circling Ranchi
 shanivaar ko loktantric janata dal ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ne lalu yadav se mulaakat kii
 After this meeting which lasted for one and a half hours, Sharad Yadav said that soon the nature of the grand alliance will be revealed
 isse pehle ham party ke adhyaksh jeethanram maanjhi or lok samta party ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha bhi lalu se kai baar mil chuke hai
 Anyway, Lalu Prasad Yadav has been putting his seal on all decisions of RJD
 ab to party ne adhikrut kar diya to iskaa matlab ye bhi nikaala ja rahaa he ki ummidavaaron ke simbel par lalu prasad yadav kaa hi hastakshar hoga
 Earlier, it was believed that the party would authorize former Chief Minister Rabri Devi for this, because there was a problem in getting legal recognition for the signature on the symbol while in jail
 lekin rajyasabha saansad manoj jha ne kaha ki jab 2018 main rajyasabha chunaav ke liye ve ummidavaar bane the to simbel par argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne hi hastakshar kiye the
 Lalu Yadav was still in jail at that time
 rabari devi ke awaas 10 circular road par hui argedy kii is mahatvapurn baithak main party ke sabhi netaa or vidhayak maujuud rahe, lekin lalu prasad yadav ke bade bete tejpratap yadav kahin nahin dikhe
 It is believed that his displeasure with the family is still intact regarding the divorce case from Aishwarya
 karnataka main echdi kumaraswami ke netritv vaali janata dal secular-congress gathbandhan sarkaar ke liye somvaar ko agnipariksha kaa din he
 Floor test is to be held in Vidhan Sabha, where Kumaraswamy government has to prove majority
 isse pehle karnataka ke sankatmochak maane jane vaale mantri dike sivakumar ne gathbandhan sarkaar bachaane ke liye aakhri daanv chalaa diya he
 CM Kumaraswamy can be replaced by another chief minister to persuade rebel mlas
 congress ke kaddavar netaa dike sivakumar kaa kahana he ki jedies sarkaar bachaane ke liye kisi bhi tarah ke tyaag ke liye taiyaar he
 Not only this, HD Kumaraswamy's party is also ready to make someone Chief Minister from Congress
 dike sivakumar ke mutabik, unhone (JDS) iske bare main hamaare haikaman ko bhi bataa diya he
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leadership in Delhi weakened, while the Siddaramaiah faction became active in Karnataka
 congress ke istipha dene vaale 13 vidhayakon main kai vidhayak siddharmaiya gut ke hai
 This is the reason why four mlas who had resigned had said that if Siddaramaiah becomes the Chief Minister, they will withdraw their resignation
 siddharmaiya ko siem banane kii baat karne vaale congress ke baagi vidhayakon main asti somshekhar, bi basswaraju, en muniratna or ramalinga reddy pramukh naam hai
 Interestingly, the biggest name in this is Ramalinga Reddy, who was the Home Minister in the Siddaramaiah government
 unako is baar mantri pad nahin diya gaya
 Ramalinga Reddy has at least three mlas from the Ramalinga Reddy faction who are with him at the moment
 iske alaava ramesh jarakeholi kar rahe hai
 Ramesh, the MLA from Gokak, was stripped of his ministerial position and given to his immediate brother Satish Jarkholi
 ramesh tab se hi party se naaraaz chal rahe the or unhone isiilie istipha diya he
 Zerkeholi is also considered close to Siddaramaiah
 bataa den ki baagi vidhayakon ko hataakar congress-jedies kii sarkaar ke paas philhal 100 kaa aankada he, jo bahumat se dur he
 Before the floor test, DK Shivakumar has taken the bet to make Siddaramaiah as CM, after which if rebel mlas are considered then the way to save power in Karnataka may also be cleared
 karnataka vidhansabha (kul number 224)bjp-105congress+spikar- 79jedies-37basapa-1nirdaleey -2namit vidhayak-1( vot kaa adhikaar nahin)bataa den ki congress ke 79 main se 13 vidhayak istipha de chuke hai or ek congressi vidhayak mumbai ke aspataal main bhartee he duusari taraf JDS ke 37 main se 3 vidhayakon ne istipha diya
 Apart from this, two independents r Shankar and h Nagesh are also not with the Kumaraswamy government
 is tarah se congress ke paas spikar sahit philhal 65 vidhayak hai or jedies ke paas 34, jinhen milakar sankhya 99 hoti he
 Apart from this, after getting support of a BSP MLA, the figure of 100 is completed
 vahiin, bijepi ke 105 vidhayak hai or use ek nirdaleey vidhayak kaa samarthan he
 In such a situation, if the Congress rebels the proposal to make Siddaramaiah as CM, then reach the Assembly before the floor test, then the number game can be reversed
 haalanki, philhal baagi vidhayak mumbai main hai
 Bollywood actress Kajol reacted to rumors that she would soon step on the small screen, saying nothing other than her own faith would bring her into the world of television
 aisi afvaahen hai ki kaajol danish televijan dharawahik 'fobridelson' (da kiling) ke bhartiya televijan sanskaran main najar aaengi, jisamen vah jaanchakarta kii bhoomika main hongi

 main ise sirf kisi ke kehane bhar se nahin karuungi
 Kajol said, "I will not do it just because rumors of my coming on television are spreading
 main ise tabhi karuungi jab aashwast houngi ki main jo kar rahi hum, vah mere liye sahi he
 ' dilli main buudhvaar ko siyaasi maahaulaus samay garma gaya jab sangam vihaar ilaake main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or aam aadmi party (AAP) ke kaaryakarta aapas main bhid gaye
 Both sides were fiercely beaten and about half a dozen workers were injured in the incident
 police puure maamle kii jaanch main jute gai he
 It is being told that during the election campaign, an argument started between the two parties about sloganeering and the talk increased so much that the fighting also started
 khabaron kii maane to do kaaryakartaaon ke sir main chot ai he jabaki baaki maamuli rup se ghayal hue
 According to the English newspaper Indian Express, after this incident, both the parties are blaming each other
 AAP vidhayak dinesh mohaniya ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi ke gundon ne unke kaaryakartaaon ke saath budtamiji kii
 At the same time BJP candidate Dr
 essiel gupta ne aarope lagaaya, 'ek gaadi main AAP kaaryakarta raat 9:30 baje hamaare karyaalay pahunche
 Some girls got down from the car and started dancing there
 wo sabhi kiran bedi or narendra modi ke khilaaf naare laga rahi thim
 Gupta said that when the people of his party tried to stop him, he escaped and returned with 30-40 people
 gupta ne aarope lagaaya, 'wo ise nukkad naatak bataa rahe hai lekin unke paas kaarylay ke baahar is tarah parform karne kii koi parmishan nahin thi
 'later both Mohania and Gupta have lodged a complaint at Sangam Vihar police station
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko chunaav prachaar kaa aakhri din he
 The parties will not be able to campaign after 6 pm
 dilli main 7 farvari ko voting honi he jabaki counting 10 farvari ko hogi
 The first Parliament session of the 17th Lok Sabha has begun
 satr ke pehle din navnirvaachit saansadon ko shapath dilaai gai lekin saansadon ke shapath grahan ke dauraan bhi hangaamaa dekhne ko mila
 Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who was in the news for controversial statements, created a new controversy on the very first day of the Parliament session, breaking the discipline of the House
 pehali baar saansad chuni gayi pragna singh thakur jab shapath lene pahunchin to unhone apane naam ke peeche swami purna chetananand avadheshanand giri jodakar shapath lenaa shuru kiya, jisapar vipakshi saansadon ne niyam-kaayadon kaa hawala dete hue aapatti jataai
 Sadhvi Pragya cites her father's name in the affidavit at the time of her election
 pi
 Singh has registered but he took the name of Avadheshananda Giri, who is his spiritual master, in place of the father's name, while taking the oath, the name is not recorded in the records
 niyamon ke mutabik namakan patr daakhil karte vakt halafname main jo naam darj karaayaa jaataa he, saansad usee naam se shapath le sakate hai, phir bhi saansad apane pita kaa naam apane naam ke saath jod sakate hai
 But the name that Pragya took was not recorded in his affidavit
 yahi baat hangaame kii vajah ban gai
 Pragya Thakur's affidavit was opposed by the opposition mps that the name Pragya is taking is off the record
 loksabhaa kii mahasachiv ne bhi kaha ki aap samvidhan yaa ishwar ke naam par shapath le sakati hai
 On the uproar of the opposition mps, the Protem Speaker made it clear that the name which will be recorded in the record can be sworn in
 vipakshi saansadon kii aapatti ke baad protem spikar ne sadan main record check karne kii baat kahi or unka pramaan patr nikalvaaya gaya
 Pragya then started swearing with the same name, then she was stopped again
 teesri baar main pragna singh thakur apni shapath puri kar sakin
 During this, Pragya appeared angry at the uproar of the opposition mps and said that at least let them take oath in the name of God
 aakhir main pragna ne bharat mata kii jai ke naare ke saath apni shapath puri kii

 com / w2okmwxkjf— ANI (@ani)june 17, 2019saaf he ki nai-nai saansad baniin pragna thakur ne sansad main apni pari ke pehle hi vaakya main satya se pare baat kahin kyonki unhone apana jo naam bataaya wo unka asli naam(halafname ke mutabik) nahin he
 Not only this, they also created unnecessary controversy in the swearing-in ceremony, that too when they had clearly stated that they are now BJP mps and will follow the discipline of the party
 bhopal se chuni gayi pragna ke shapath grahan ke dauraan vipaksh kii narebaaji ke jawaab main bijepi saansad bhi apni seat se khadey hokar pragna kaa samarthan karte dikhe
 Pragya Singh took oath in Sanskrit

 He defeated Congress leader Digvijay Singh in the election
 sadhvi pragna singh thakur maharashtra ke maalegaanv dhamaakon kii aaropee bhi hai
 Deeply disputed by the controversies, Singh Thakur gave a disputed statement on STF Chief Hemant Karkare, who was martyred in the Mumbai blasts, saying that he had received the punishment for his deeds and i cursed him
 saath hi pragna singh apane ek anya bayaan main mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko shahid bataa chuki hai
 He was severely criticized for both these statements
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi bagaiyr naam liya kaha tha ki aise bayaan dene waalon ko vah nijee taur par kabhi maaf nahin kar sakate

 The photo of the Chief Minister has been made a question of the turban by the Akali Dal and that is why the Badal government, which is debt-ridden, is spending Rs 36 crore annually from its treasury for ambulance service

 As the battle for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 is reaching its end, the tongue of the leaders in the election campaign is becoming increasingly hot
 bhartiya janata party ke bhaashanon main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi aa gaye hai, to pradhanmantri narendra modi ko jawaab dete hue mamata banerjee ne unke haath khun se sane hone tak kii baat kah di he
 On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav, who seems soft towards the Congress, has now openly criticized the Congress leaders and in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav has called Chief Minister Nitish Kumar an uncle 420
 yani loksabhaa chunaav ke antim daur main har party va netaa khulkar va simaaon se aage badhkar apane virodhiyon par tippanee karne lage hai
 In this sequence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks about former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi have become the center of the biggest controversy
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki rajeev gandhi ke jivan kaa ant 'bhrashtachari nambar ek' ke rup main hua
 Terming the pm's remarks as rude, illegal and against Indian traditions, the Congress has complained to the Election Commission against PM Modi and demanded a ban on his campaigning
 yahaan tak ki is tippanee kaa jawaab dete hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi va priyanka gandhi ne bhi piem modi ke khilaaf apana gussa jaahir kiya tha
 Priyanka had said that the martyrdom of a noble person has been insulted in the unbridled craze

 Similar stern attitude against PM Modi has now been shown by Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress President Mamta Banerjee
 piem modi ne mamata raaj main bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki bengal main kisi bhi kaam ke liye 'trinmul tolabaji tex' yani TTT dena padataa tha
 Responding to Modi's remarks, Mamata Banerjee called PM Modi a rioter
 mamata ne kaha he ki mujhe tolbaj bol rahe ho, lekin aap sir se paanv tak khun se sane hue ho or aap danga karaane vaale ho
 'secret relationship with Imran' The same fight is being seen in Delhi too

 Earlier in Bihar, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has commented on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 tejasvi ne kaha tha ki hamane bachapan main chachee 420 film dekhi or ab chachaa 420 dekh rahe hai
 Apart from the main leaders of major political parties, other leaders are not behind in making controversial comments

 cab rape cond ke aaropee shiv kumarper pehle bhi aarope lag chuke hai par uber ne ise gambhirtha se nahin liya, ek american mahila ne twitor par apni shikaayat or shiv kumaar kii photo vaali parchi share kii he, saath hi uber ke taraf se aae jawaab bhi daalaa he jisamen shiv kumaar ke khilaaf jaanch kii baat kii gai thi
 As the horoscope of rape accused Shiv Kumar Yadav's crime horoscope is being opened in the cab on Friday from the female executive, Shiva's sensational acts are coming out
 taaja maamla he america main rahane vaali ek mahila kaa he, jisane shiv ke khilaaf ubar main shikaayat kii thi
 After the rape was revealed in the moving cab, this woman herself has heard the tweet by herself
 mahila ke mutabik 26 november ko usne chandani chowk se palam ke liye ubar kii cab book kii thi
 Even that day the driver of the cab was Shiva Yadav
 mahila ke mutabik puure safar ke dauraan aaropee shiv use buree niyat se ghur rahaa tha or safar ke baad usne ubar se isaki shikaayat bhi kii thi
 The woman has also shared the booking receipt on Twitter

 This is certainly not expected in Uber
 maine driver oparation team ko aapkaa feedback badha diya he taaki shiv ko lekar wo isaki jaanch kar saken
 Let me tell you that the woman made the complaint on 26 November and Uber's reply came on 2 December
 yani puure ek hafte kaa vakt laga
 Obviously, the seriousness of the company also raises questions
 baharhaal sawaal uthte hai ki agar ubar ne shiv ne khilaaf usee vakt karrwai kii hoti to mahila akjicutive ke saath rape nahin hota
 Significantly, Shiva is an old historyheater
 uske gaanv ke log bataate hai ki uski gandi harkaton se harkoi waakif hai
 The shocking thing is that as soon as the news of Shiva's arrest reached his village Ram Nagar, the women there started celebrating
 unhone halava baanta or shiv mandir main puja kii

 aapako bataa den ki shiv yadav ko 2013 main rape se jude ek maamle main mainpuri main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 However, he was released on bail after 6 months

 modiji chaahate hai ki log sochen or alag tareeke se kaam karen
 "naidu said," What is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan? Basically it tells citizens to think before throwing any garbage in the open
 '' "the purpose of invalidating big notes is also to change our thinking about money and the way we spend cash," he said

 He got a huge response on this
 '' Naidu said, "mamta ji (mamata Banerjee) wants to present herself as a leader

 Naidu said that the rules of the country's politics have changed to a great extent in the last few years
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, ''log kaha karte the ki aap vikaas ke agenda par chunaav nahin jeet sakate
 Modiji showed that you can win elections on the issue of development as well
 '' unhone kaha ki modi ne gujarat main sabit kiya or madhya pradesh tathaa chhattisgarh main bhaajapa teen baar vikaas ke agenda par chunaav jeet gai
 Naidu said that after demonetisation, BJP won 80 percent of panchayat seats in Gujarat
 unhone kaha, ''nae raajnneetik sameekaran main logon kii vaastavik aakankshaayen parilakshith honi chahie
 The public does not want hollow promises
 log kuch aisa chaahate hai jisase unka jivan str sudhare
 The Union Minister said that the ground reality is that the common people have fully supported the decision of demonetisation
 unhone kaha, ''isi baat se congress or kuch virdohi dal pareshaan hai

 The Parliament passed the Indian Representation of People (amendment) Bill 2013 on Friday with the seal of the Lok Sabha
 yah vidheyak sarvocch nyaayalay ke jail main kaid yaa police hiraasat se netaaon ke chunaav ladane par pabandi lagane vaale faisle ko nishprabhavi karne ke uddeshy se laayaa gaya he
 The Rajya Sabha passed the bill on 28 August itself
 sansad kaa satr shuru hone ke saath hi sabhi partiyon ne ek sur se sarkaar se sheersh adaalat ke faisle ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye vidheyak laane kii maang kii thi
 The parties feared that the opponents could disqualify any candidate from contesting elections by resorting to false trial on the occasion of the election under the apex court's decision
 yah vidheyak sarvocch nyaayalay ke 10 july ke us faisle ko nishprabhavi karegaa jisamen adaalat ne kaha tha ki jo log jail main band hai ve chunaav sambandhi kanoon ke mutabik matdaan main hissaa nahin le sakate isliye ve sansad yaa rajya vidhansabhaon kaa chunaav bhi ladane ke yogya nahin hai
 Law Bill Kapil Sibal introduced this bill
 unhone sadan se kaha, "kai baar ham chook karte hai or kai baar adaalatein chook jaati hai
 The court has defaulted in this case and today we are correcting it
 " Sibal had earlier said that there has been a common 'negative perception' in the country that leaders are criminals
 tippaniyan Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member Kirti Azad and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member Dara Singh Chauhan said that many times leaders go to jail taking part in agitations on social issues and such arrests are equivalent to arrests in criminal cases Can not be considered
 sarkaar ne sheersh adaalat main punarvichaar yachika daayar kii thi, lekin vahaan se raahat nahin milane ke baad sanshodhan vidheyak pesh kiya
 With the commencement of the session of Parliament, all parties had unanimously demanded the government to bring a bill to neutralize the verdict of the apex court
 partiyon ko is baat kaa dar tha ki sheersh adaalat ke faisle kii aad main chunaav ke maukey par jhuthe mukademe kaa sahaara lekar virdohi kisi pratyaashee ko chunaav ladane se ayogy tehra sakate hai
 The bill will nullify the Supreme Court's July 10 judgment in which the court said that those who are in jail cannot participate in voting as per election law, so they are not even eligible to contest elections in Parliament or state legislatures
 Huh
 kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ne yah vidheyak pesh kiya
 He told the House, "sometimes we miss and sometimes the courts miss
 is maamle main adaalat ne chook kii he or aaj ham use durust kar rahe hai
 " sibbal ne isse pehle kaha tha ki desh main ek aam 'nakaaratmak dharna' ban gai he ki netaa apradhi hote hai
 The comments bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke sadsy kirti aaazaad or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke sadsy daara singh chouhan ne kaha ki kai baar netaa saamaajik muddon ko lekar andolan main hissaa lete hue jail jate hai or aisi giraftaar ko aapraadhik maamalon main giraftaar ke samatuly nahin mana ja saktaa
 The government had filed a review petition in the apex court, but after not getting relief from there, introduced the amendment bill

 cricket vishwa cap 2019 main england or bharat ke bich khele gaye mukaable main bharat ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The color of India's jersey is blue, but for this match, India landed on the field especially in orange and blue jerseys
 team india kii is jersey ko lekar bavaal to pehle se hi machaa hua tha lekin match khatm hone ke baad bhi ye bavaal jari he

 There are crazy people in our country who are adding the name of the country to the soil

 On the pretext of cricket, at least the two countries are together
 bataa den ki england ke khilaaf bharat ke match jeetne kii duaen sirf bharat main hi nahin, balki padosi desh pakistan ne bhi kin
 In fact, if India had won well against England and won, then Pakistan's semi-final road would have been a little easier
 lekin ab bharat kii haar se pakistan ke semifinal main pahunchane kaa sameekaran gadabada gaya he
 In this match played between India and England, England batting first scored 337 runs at the loss of 7 wickets
 jiske jawaab main bhartiya team nirdhaarit over main 5 wicket khokar 306 ran hi bana pai

 prayagraj ke kumbh kshetra main jagatguru shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati kii ore se bulaai gai param dharm sansad main elaan kiya gaya he ki 21 farvari se ram mandir kaa nirmaan shuru hoga
 a resolution to lay the foundation stone for the Ram temple has been passed in the Supreme Religion Parliament
 iske liye sadhu sanyasi ayodhya kii ore kooch karenge
 Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati made this announcement and told that the saints of all the akharas have also been talked about for this
 haalanki, mandir kaa nirmaan kis jagah par hoga, is bare main kuch spasht nahin kaha gaya he
 The Supreme Religion Parliament made this announcement at a time when the matter is pending in the Supreme Court and other organizations including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad are pressuring the government to build the temple
 vihip kii dharm sansad kaa aayojan aaj se hone vaala he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already said that the government will take a decision only after the decision of the Supreme Court
 lekin hinduvadi sanghathan dharm sansad or pradarshnon ke jariye mandir nirmaan ke liye sarkaar par dabaav bana rahe hai
 However, the Religion Parliament of Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati is running in Prayagraj, on the other hand, the Religion Parliament of VHP will be held on 31 January and 1 February
 is dharm sansad main nrity gopal das jaise dharmik guruon ke saath aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat shaamil honge
 Sometimes the foundation will be laid, sometimes the construction will be done in such a manner that Jagatguru Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati has announced to start the construction of the temple in Prayagraj from next month, similar announcement has been done by the saints before
 kabhi koi kahata he ki ayodhya main ram mandir kii aadharshila rakhenge to kabhi koi kahata he ki ham mandir kaa nirmaan karenge
 It is also noteworthy that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) passed the resolution at the Palampur session in 1989 and openly supported the Ram temple
 tabhi se vah mandir mudde kaa khulkar samarthan karti rahi he
 When she was not in power, she used to ask the then governments to make laws and give the disputed land to build temples
 ek duusari baat yah he ki sanathan hindu dharm kii parampara ke mutabik ramanandacharya sampradaay ne is sthaan ke rakh-rakhaav or puja kaa jimmaa nirmohi akhaada ko diya he
 Nirmohi Arena has been fighting the legal battle of Ram temple since 1885
 matlab ki vishwa hindu parishad kaa ram janm bhoomi nyaas sabhi hinduon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karata
 Shankaracharya is also not with VHP
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki viechpi kaa nyaas nirmohi akhaada ko isse baahar karnaa chahta he
 What the leaders of the parties say at present? In the Ram temple case, the Modi government has sought permission from the Supreme Court to remove status quo from the government's non-disputed 67 acres of land, and return it to its owners
 jiskaa rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad ne swaagat kiya he
 But political parties are criticizing it
 bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo mayawati ne kaha, 'vivaadit or adhikrut jameen ko ram janmabhumi nyaas ko lautaane kii maang karnaa saraasar nyaay kaary main hastkshep he or yah chunaav ko prabhavit karne vaala kadam he
 This step of the central government has been taken in view of the election, so that the common people should be cautious
 supreme court kii milkiyat vaali ayodhya kii jameen par yathasthiti ko bigaadane kaa yah khel bhadakaane vaala he
 BJP is executing this keeping in mind the election
 'is mudde par congress or communist partiyon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 She has been asking for a solution to the temple issue through the Supreme Court
 congress netaa or uttar pradesh ke prabharee raaj babbar ne kuch din pehle hi kaha tha ki ram mandir banane par koi vivaad nahin he
 Actually, the dispute is about the ownership of the land concerned
 ayodhya main ram mandir kii bhoomi par ram mandir nyaas, hanuman akhaada or vakf board adaalat main cese lard rahe hai
 BJP is leaving Shigufa just to build Ram temple outside the court
 vahiin kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki log chaahate hai ki jameen ke malikana haq (tital suut) se judi yachika kaa jald se jald nipataara ho
 He also said that the central government has full faith in the Supreme Court
 29 janvari ko kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha tha bijepi chaahati he ki ram mandir bane
 PM Modi has also said in this interview
 sarkaar kaa faisla bhi kanoonee rasta he
 We are confident that this land will be free
 aisa hone se rasta prashast ho jayega

 priyanka gandhi ne apane pati robert wadra ke saath nai dilli ke lodi estate main matdaan kiya
 During this, he also responded to the statement of 45 years of austerity by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki agar unhone 50 ghante bhi tapasya kar lee hoti to is tarah se nafrat bhari baaten nahin karte
 When Priyanka Gandhi came out of the polling station after voting in Lok Sabha elections, she answered the media's questions
 is dauraan jab unase poocha gaya ki piem modi ne kaha he ki khan market gang ne meri chhavi nahin banaai he, ye 45 saal kii tapasya se bani he jise koi dhwast nahin kar saktaa
 When this same question was asked to Priyanka Gandhi, she replied that if she had done austerity for 50 hours, she would not have hated such things
 'jawaab nahin dete piem'iske alaava priyanka gandhi ne piem modi ko di gai chunauti par bhi jawaab diya
 He said that the Prime Minister does not answer anything
 priyanka ne kaha ki 15 lakh rupee va 2 karod rojgaar ke jo vaade unhone kiye us par bhi jawaab nahin dete
 Priyanka said that he (narendra Modi) does not even respond to Rahul ji's challenge
 priyanka ne piem narendra modi par nafrat va krodh kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Apart from this, Priyanka Gandhi also said that the BJP government is going, this thing is very clear
 vahiin, dilli kii siton par ho rahe chunaav par priyanka ne kaha ki aam aadmi party se gathbandhan nahin hone se bijepi ko phayda nahin hoga
 He also said that the Congress is contesting all the seats well

 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie

 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar

 Meanwhile, the Chief Minister and the Education Minister also gave orders, but nothing happened
 june main jo rigelt aa janaa chahie tha wo aayaa 19 sitambar ko
 In Maharashtra, the rule is that the result should come within 30 to 45 days of the examination
 iske baad bhi 2300 chaatro ke nattejey abhi tak nahin aae hai
 While the second season has started
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 3700 uttar pustikaayen gaayab ho gai hai
 This year, the university decided that all the results would be checked online
 shikshakon ke paas training nahin thi or shikshak bhi paryaapt nahin the
 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced
 unka kahana he ki unka paper acha hua tha
 Students are demanding a double check
 tippaniyan Like Delhi University, Mumbai University is also relying on ad hoc teachers
 yahaan jis tarah pad khaali hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki sarkaron kii nitiyon ke do charan he
 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case
 mumbai uniwarsity main 86 professor hone chahie magar hai sirf 35
 Professor has 51 vacancies
 sahaayak professor hone chahien 279 magar hai sirf 170
 You must be thinking that there will be some university which will be of the kind, where all the teachers will be there, we have not found them, you can tell which is such a university
 saadhaaran aay vaale pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye shiksha mahangi bhi ho rahi he or mushkil bhi

 After hearing all these things, one can be confident that the work of dharam-karam is going well
 ummid he log dharam-karam ke kaam main pathan-pathan kaa bhi kaam shaamil karte honge
 Education is also the work of Dharam

 yah bhi sunne ko mila ki post graduate ke chaatro ne college aana kam kar diya he
 Saket College should have 145 regular teachers but only 85 are there
 wo bhi inamen se haal philhal main bhi niyukt hue hai
 For a long time this college has been running on the strength of 60-65 teachers
 aaj bhi yahaan 60 shikshakon kii kami he

 The details of the mess will not be appropriate at this time because Ayodhya is immersed in the Deepotvas

 The rest of the students do class by standing or sitting down
 harbans ne bataaya ki yahaan 75 fisadi adivasee chaatr 40-40 kimi dur se cycle chalaakar aate hai
 They all come from Saranda area
 jahaan aaj bhi mobile tower thik se kaam nahin karata he
 The system of filling the online form has come to the university, but due to lack of network, many students are unable to fill the form
 jiske kaaran kai chaatr ek hi class main 2-2 saal se atak gaye hai
 Because you cannot give exams due to not filling the online form
 yah bhi sunne ko mila ki samasya lekar chaatr jab vaais chancelar ke paas jate hai to ve coffee pilaate hai
 The problem is not solved, but there is a plan to listen to the problem called 'coffee with VC'
 yah kaarykram is uniwarsity ke tamaam collejon main yojit kiya ja rahaa he

 There are 300 students in the Department of Politics but there is only one to teach
 janajaatiy samaaj ke liye uniwarsity banati he, janajaatiy adhyayan ke liye bhi shikshak nahin he
 Only governments can tell these jokes to their people
 janata bhi hansatii rah jaati he or netaa apni murti banavaa kar chale jate hai
 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all
 netaa aate hai or lab kaa udghaatan karke chale jate hai
 The headline is printed in the newspaper that Digital India is done
 ye khabar isliye chhapi he ki kolhaan uniwarsity main pichdi kii degree pehle baant di gai or imtahaan baad main liya gaya
 It has been published in the newspaper that the Controller of Examinations of Kolhan University issued a strange notification on September 8, 2017
 isamen piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kar chuke shodharthiyon ko bhi corsework kii pariksha ke liye aavedan karne ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 It is rarely heard that the degree is divided first and then the examination is being done
 zaruri he ki ham or aap taj mahal ke masale ko lekar uljhe rahe taaki vyavasthaaen hamen bevakoof banaati rahen
 You can also listen to the condition of Jamshedpur Women's College
 1953 main bane is kalege main 9000 chatraayen padhati hai

 There has been no appointment in these colleges since 2008
 abhi jahaan bhi niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai wo bahut dhimi gati se ho rahi hai
 Not all posts are being filled
 har jagah ek shikshak par chaatro kii sankhya itani he ki koi bhi vishwa stareey chhodie zila stareey top college banane kaa sapana nahin dekh saktaa
 According to the guide lines drawn by the UGC, a teacher in a university that dreams of becoming world class should have only 20 students
 yahaan na to 300 chaatro par ek teacher he
 Mumbai runs from Kolhan in Jharkhand

 The roof drips during the rainy season
 duusari manzil kaa ek slab tut chukaa he
 Leave repair, no one has even picked up the debris

 You yourself see its condition
 yahaan par ek haal bhi he jisaki chat do saal pehle tut gai thi, aaj tak marammat nahin hui he
 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education
 aapke hukmaranon, netaaon ne aapako fansaa diya he
 Now you can't get out of it
 isse nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he ki aap apana dhyaan hindu-muslim jaise masalon main lagaaein
 Sohit Mishra is now taking you to the Bhavan Bhawan built on the University campus
 jane kaa rasta bhi nahin he
 Sohit brings you here, avoiding any kind of slipping
 kisi ko ghaas bhi nazar nahin aati he
 Mumbai University seems to have declared himself dead
 ye bhashaa bhawan he
 The campus of Bhasha Bhawan has been built in 2015, the building is lying in this way
 jo staff sohit ko lekar gaya wo saanp ke dar se aage nahin gaya
 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you
 ye mumbai uniwarsity ke campus main he
 Branda Kurla Complex is in Mumbai University
 ye shankar raav chouhan shikshak prashikshan kii building he
 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai
 It cannot be a big positive story

 Results of all subjects should have come here by 15 June
 jab rigelt nahin aayaa to hangaamaa hone laga
 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August
 is bich mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri ne bhi aadesh die magar kuch nahin hua
 The result that should have come in June came on 19 September
 maharashtra main niyam he ki pariksha hone ke 30 se 45 din ke bheetar riselt aa janaa chahie
 Even after this, the results of 2300 students are yet to come
 jabaki doosraa satr shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 3700 answer sheets have disappeared

 He says that his paper did well
 chaatr dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments dilli uniwarsity kii tarah mumbai uniwarsity bhi edock shikshakon ke bharose chal rahi he
 Seeing the way the posts are vacant here, it seems that there are two stages of the policies of the governments
 pehle to college main bagaiyr master ke padhaao taaki ve aaajeevan berojgaar bane rahe, agar inamen se koi phir bhi pard-likh letaa he to inhen kisi bhi haal main master mat banane do
 There should be 86 professors at Mumbai University but only 35
 professor ke 51 pad khaali hai
 There should be 279 Assistant Professors but there are only 170

 They all come from Saranda area
 jahaan aaj bhi mobile tower thik se kaam nahin karata he
 The system of filling the online form has come to the university, but due to lack of network, many students are unable to fill the form
 jiske kaaran kai chaatr ek hi class main 2-2 saal se atak gaye hai
 Because you cannot give exams due to not filling the online form

 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all

 You can also listen to the condition of Jamshedpur Women's College

 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education

 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you

 Branda Kurla Complex is in Mumbai University
 ye shankar raav chouhan shikshak prashikshan kii building he
 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai
 It cannot be a big positive story
 mumbai uniwarsity main ek vivaad bhi chal rahaa he
 Results of all subjects should have come here by 15 June
 jab rigelt nahin aayaa to hangaamaa hone laga
 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August
 is bich mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri ne bhi aadesh die magar kuch nahin hua
 The result that should have come in June came on 19 September
 maharashtra main niyam he ki pariksha hone ke 30 se 45 din ke bheetar riselt aa janaa chahie
 Even after this, the results of 2300 students are yet to come
 jabaki doosraa satr shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 3700 answer sheets have disappeared

 Seeing the way the posts are vacant here, it seems that there are two stages of the policies of the governments
 pehle to college main bagaiyr master ke padhaao taaki ve aaajeevan berojgaar bane rahe, agar inamen se koi phir bhi pard-likh letaa he to inhen kisi bhi haal main master mat banane do
 There should be 86 professors at Mumbai University but only 35
 professor ke 51 pad khaali hai
 There should be 279 Assistant Professors but there are only 170

 The exact number of girls was not known but it was found that there is no toilet for them in the college campus
 girls kamanroom main maatr chah shauchalay hai
 Which are not enough
 yah bhi sunne ko mila ki post graduate ke chaatro ne college aana kam kar diya he
 Saket College should have 145 regular teachers but only 85 are there
 wo bhi inamen se haal philhal main bhi niyukt hue hai
 For a long time this college has been running on the strength of 60-65 teachers
 aaj bhi yahaan 60 shikshakon kii kami he
 In some subjects, there are guest teachers who are teaching at a salary of 15 to 20 thousand

 The details of the mess will not be appropriate at this time because Ayodhya is immersed in the Deepotvas

 jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav yahaan gaye to get band tha or andar main gaay-bakrii charaai ja rahi thim
 Shrubs have grown at the main gate itself
 gandagi kaa vivaran is vakt uchit nahin hoga kyonki ayodhya deepotvas main dubaa hua he
 This is a government college
 college kii imaarat kaa koun sa hissaa dekhakar aap khud ko tasalli dilaanaa chahenge ki kuch nahin hoga, keval is mulk main netaa baaten hi karenge
 Seeing the arrangement of the toilet, it seems that this is called the system
 jahaan shouch kii jagah ho vahiin kursiyaan rakh do
 There is a shortage of teachers in all subjects of this college
 yahaan saat vishyon kii padhai hoti he
 There are 125 students and 6 teachers
 angrezi main 20 chaatr hai or ek bhi shikshak nahin he
 There are 631 colleges in Avadh University
 33 ke kareeb hi sarkari hai or baaki self finance vaale college hai
 Which we call private colleges
 kai privet college main teacher aath se das hazaar main padhaa rahe hai
 The good thing is that there is no celebration now for studies
 samaaj or chaatro ne bhi ucch shiksha ke mudde ko chhod diya he
 Now we go to Chaibasa in Jharkhand
 yahaan par ek vishvavidhyalay he jiskaa naam he kolhaan uniwarsity
 The foundation of this university was laid for the most backward tribal and non-tribal students of the area
 2009 main uniwarsity banane kii ghoshnaa hui thi, abhi tak building banane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Tata College Chaibasa gave the land
 is uniwarsity kii bhi haalat yakeen dilaati he ki aap bharat main kahin bhi chale jaaiye, ucch shiksha kaa haal badahaal milegaa
 90 percent of the students studying at Kolhan University with 16 affiliated and 27 affiliated colleges are really poor
 zyaadaatar adivasee hai
 When we were shooting, it was a college holiday, otherwise you would have seen another reality of India
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki har vibhaag ke paas do hi kamare hai
 One room is for MA first year and one room for second year
 ek kamare kaa aakaar bees bai bees foot kaa hi he
 There are hardly 40-50 students
 baaki chaatr khadey hokar yaa neeche baithkar class karte hai
 Harbans said that 75 percent of tribal students come here cycling from 40-40 km away
 ye sabhi saranda ilaake se aate hai
 Where even today, the mobile tower does not work properly
 uniwarsity main online farm bharne kii vyavastha to aa gai he magar network na hone ke kaaran kai chaatr farm nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to which many students are stuck in the same class for 2-2 years
 kyonki online farm nahin bharne ke kaaran imtahaan hi nahin de sakate hai
 It was also heard that when the students go to the Vice Chancellor with a problem, they drink coffee
 samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota magar samasya sunne kii ek yojana he jiskaa naam he 'coffee vid visi'
 This program is being organized in all the colleges of this university
 akhabaaron main khabar chhapati he ki aaj falaan college main 'coffee vid visi' he
 The Vice Chancellor will hear the students' problem
 samaadhaan nahin hota magar hedline ban jaati he
 You must be wondering where we reached Kolhan
 aap darshakon main se hi koi hamen yahaan se vahaan le ja rahaa he
 On August 13, 2009, the state government approved the position of 22 professors, 44 associate professors, 88 assistant professors for 22 departments of this university
 aaj tak yahaan kisi bhi sthaayee bahaali nahin hui he
 There are 22 teachers who have been brought here through transfers
 paryaavaran ko lekar ham kitne gambhir ho jate hai magar sthaneey media kii report se pataa chalaa ki yahaan paryaavaran vigyaan padhaane ke liye master hi nahin he
 There are 350 students in the Hindi department but only 2 are there to teach
 raajnneeti vibhaag main 300 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf ek hai
 University is formed for tribal society, there is no teacher for tribal studies
 ye chutkula sirf sarkarein hi suna sakati hai apni janata ko
 The public also continues to laugh and the leaders go away with their idols
 kuch college main computer lab he magar lab khulte hi nahin he
 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave
 akhbaar main hedline chap jaati he ki digital india ho gaya he
 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination
 aisa kam hi suna hoga ki pehle degree bant gai or phir imtahaan ho rahaa he
 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us
 jamshedpur mahila college kaa haal bhi aap sun lijie
 This college, formed in 1953, has 9000 students
 1977 ke baad se yaha padon kii sankhya nahin badi he jabaki chaatraon kii sankhya kai guna bad gai he
 There should be 57 teachers but there are only 34 teachers
 46 guest teacher padhaa rahe hai jinhen maheene main 5000 se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 Those taking post graduate classes are getting a salary of five thousand
 jo piji toppers hota he usee ko padhaane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Details of teachers in some other colleges of this university have come to know that 84 posts are approved in Tata College Chaibasa but there are only 25 teachers
 mahila college chibasa main 40 pad manzur hai magar 15 shikshak hi hai
 Ghatshila College, Ghatshila has 40 posts, but only 18 teachers
 2008 ke baad se in collejon main niyukti hi nahin hui he
 Wherever appointments are being done, they are happening very slowly
 saare pad nahin bhare ja rahe hai
 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie
 Neither is a teacher here at 300 students
 jharkhand ke kolhaan se chalate hai mumbai
 Everything must be right there
 130 saal puraani he yah mumbai uniwarsity
 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year

 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced

 Students are demanding a double check

 You must be thinking that there will be some university which will be of the kind, where all the teachers will be there, we have not found them, you can tell which is such a university
 shauchalay kii vyavastha dekhakar lagata he ki vyavastha isi ko kehete hai
 Place chairs where there is a place of defecation

 There are seven subjects taught here

 There are 20 students in English and not a single teacher
 avadh uniwarsity main 631 college jude hai
 Around 33 are government-run and the rest are self-finance colleges
 jinhen ham privet college kehete hai
 Teachers are teaching eight to ten thousand in many private colleges
 acchhee baat he ki padhai ko lekar ab kahin utsav nahin he
 Society and students have also left the issue of higher education
 ab ham chalate hai jharkhand ke chibasa
 There is a university here called Kolhan University
 is uniwarsity kii buniyaad ilaake ke ati pichde adivasee or gair adivasee chaatro ke liye rakhi gai thi
 The university was announced in 2009, yet the construction work is going on

 It was also learned that each department has only two rooms

 The size of a room is twenty by twenty feet
 mushkil se 40-50 chaatr aate hai
 The rest of the students do class by standing or sitting down
 harbans ne bataaya ki yahaan 75 fisadi adivasee chaatr 40-40 kimi dur se cycle chalaakar aate hai
 They all come from Saranda area
 jahaan aaj bhi mobile tower thik se kaam nahin karata he
 The system of filling the online form has come to the university, but due to lack of network, many students are unable to fill the form
 jiske kaaran kai chaatr ek hi class main 2-2 saal se atak gaye hai
 Because you cannot give exams due to not filling the online form
 yah bhi sunne ko mila ki samasya lekar chaatr jab vaais chancelar ke paas jate hai to ve coffee pilaate hai
 The problem is not solved, but there is a plan to listen to the problem called 'coffee with VC'
 yah kaarykram is uniwarsity ke tamaam collejon main yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 News appears in newspapers that today there is 'coffee with VC' in Falan College
 vaais chancelar chaatro kii samasya sunenge
 There is no solution but a headline is created
 aap soch rahe honge ki ham kolhaan kahaan pahunch gaye
 Someone in the audience is taking us from here to there
 13 agast, 2009 ko is uniwarsity ke 22 vibhaagon ke liye 22 professor, 44 associat professor, 88 sahaayak professor ke pad ke liye rajya sarkaar ne sweekruti di thi
 Till date there has not been any permanent restoration here

 How serious we get about the environment, but local media reports showed that there is no master to teach environmental science here

 There are 300 students in the Department of Politics but there is only one to teach
 janajaatiy samaaj ke liye uniwarsity banati he, janajaatiy adhyayan ke liye bhi shikshak nahin he
 Only governments can tell these jokes to their people
 janata bhi hansatii rah jaati he or netaa apni murti banavaa kar chale jate hai
 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all
 netaa aate hai or lab kaa udghaatan karke chale jate hai
 The headline is printed in the newspaper that Digital India is done
 ye khabar isliye chhapi he ki kolhaan uniwarsity main pichdi kii degree pehle baant di gai or imtahaan baad main liya gaya
 It has been published in the newspaper that the Controller of Examinations of Kolhan University issued a strange notification on September 8, 2017
 isamen piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kar chuke shodharthiyon ko bhi corsework kii pariksha ke liye aavedan karne ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 It is rarely heard that the degree is divided first and then the examination is being done
 zaruri he ki ham or aap taj mahal ke masale ko lekar uljhe rahe taaki vyavasthaaen hamen bevakoof banaati rahen
 You can also listen to the condition of Jamshedpur Women's College
 1953 main bane is kalege main 9000 chatraayen padhati hai
 The number of posts has not increased since 1977, while the number of girl students has increased manifold
 yahaan par 57 shikshak hone chahie magar hai 34 shikshak hi
 There are 46 guest teachers who cannot get more than 5000 a month
 post graduate kii class lene vaale ko paanch hazaar kii selary mil rahi he
 Those who are PG toppers are asked to teach the same

 There are 40 posts sanctioned in the women's college Chaibasa but only 15 teachers
 ghatshila college, ghatshila main 40 pad manzur hai magar 18 shikshak hi hai
 There has been no appointment in these colleges since 2008
 abhi jahaan bhi niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai wo bahut dhimi gati se ho rahi hai
 Not all posts are being filled
 har jagah ek shikshak par chaatro kii sankhya itani he ki koi bhi vishwa stareey chhodie zila stareey top college banane kaa sapana nahin dekh saktaa
 According to the guide lines drawn by the UGC, a teacher in a university that dreams of becoming world class should have only 20 students
 yahaan na to 300 chaatro par ek teacher he
 Mumbai runs from Kolhan in Jharkhand
 vahaan to sab kuch thik hi hona chahie
 This University of Mumbai is 130 years old
 iske 4 campus hai or 774 college sambanddh hai
 It is counted among the large universities in India
 ye jawahar laal nehru librari he
 The building is fine but the condition inside is bad
 deevaaron par daraaren padi hui hai
 The roof drips during the rainy season
 duusari manzil kaa ek slab tut chukaa he
 Leave repair, no one has even picked up the debris
 yahaan par khel-kud ke saamaan to hai magar khilne ke liye jagah nahin he
 You yourself see its condition
 yahaan par ek haal bhi he jisaki chat do saal pehle tut gai thi, aaj tak marammat nahin hui he
 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education
 aapke hukmaranon, netaaon ne aapako fansaa diya he
 Now you can't get out of it
 isse nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he ki aap apana dhyaan hindu-muslim jaise masalon main lagaaein
 Sohit Mishra is now taking you to the Bhavan Bhawan built on the University campus
 jane kaa rasta bhi nahin he
 Sohit brings you here, avoiding any kind of slipping
 kisi ko ghaas bhi nazar nahin aati he
 Mumbai University seems to have declared himself dead
 ye bhashaa bhawan he
 The campus of Bhasha Bhawan has been built in 2015, the building is lying in this way
 jo staff sohit ko lekar gaya wo saanp ke dar se aage nahin gaya
 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you
 ye mumbai uniwarsity ke campus main he
 Branda Kurla Complex is in Mumbai University
 ye shankar raav chouhan shikshak prashikshan kii building he
 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai
 It cannot be a big positive story
 mumbai uniwarsity main ek vivaad bhi chal rahaa he
 Results of all subjects should have come here by 15 June
 jab rigelt nahin aayaa to hangaamaa hone laga
 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August
 is bich mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri ne bhi aadesh die magar kuch nahin hua
 The result that should have come in June came on 19 September
 maharashtra main niyam he ki pariksha hone ke 30 se 45 din ke bheetar riselt aa janaa chahie
 Even after this, the results of 2300 students are yet to come
 jabaki doosraa satr shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 3700 answer sheets have disappeared
 is saal uniwarsity ne faisla liya ki sabhi nattejey online check honge
 Teachers did not have training and teachers were not enough
 jo nattejey ghoshit hue hai unamem kai chaatro ko 0 se lekar 5 ank die gaye hai
 He says that his paper did well
 chaatr dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments dilli uniwarsity kii tarah mumbai uniwarsity bhi edock shikshakon ke bharose chal rahi he
 Seeing the way the posts are vacant here, it seems that there are two stages of the policies of the governments
 pehle to college main bagaiyr master ke padhaao taaki ve aaajeevan berojgaar bane rahe, agar inamen se koi phir bhi pard-likh letaa he to inhen kisi bhi haal main master mat banane do
 There should be 86 professors at Mumbai University but only 35
 professor ke 51 pad khaali hai
 There should be 279 Assistant Professors but there are only 170
 aap soch rahe honge ki koi to uniwarsity hogi jo dhang kii hogi, jahaan sabhi shikshak honge, hamen to nahin mili, aap hi bataa dijie ki aisi koun si uniwarsity he
 The good thing is that there is no celebration now for studies
 samaaj or chaatro ne bhi ucch shiksha ke mudde ko chhod diya he
 Now we go to Chaibasa in Jharkhand
 yahaan par ek vishvavidhyalay he jiskaa naam he kolhaan uniwarsity
 The foundation of this university was laid for the most backward tribal and non-tribal students of the area
 2009 main uniwarsity banane kii ghoshnaa hui thi, abhi tak building banane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Tata College Chaibasa gave the land
 is uniwarsity kii bhi haalat yakeen dilaati he ki aap bharat main kahin bhi chale jaaiye, ucch shiksha kaa haal badahaal milegaa
 90 percent of the students studying at Kolhan University with 16 affiliated and 27 affiliated colleges are really poor
 zyaadaatar adivasee hai
 When we were shooting, it was a college holiday, otherwise you would have seen another reality of India
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki har vibhaag ke paas do hi kamare hai
 One room is for MA first year and one room for second year
 ek kamare kaa aakaar bees bai bees foot kaa hi he
 There are hardly 40-50 students
 baaki chaatr khadey hokar yaa neeche baithkar class karte hai
 Harbans said that 75 percent of tribal students come here cycling from 40-40 km away
 ye sabhi saranda ilaake se aate hai
 Where even today, the mobile tower does not work properly
 uniwarsity main online farm bharne kii vyavastha to aa gai he magar network na hone ke kaaran kai chaatr farm nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to which many students are stuck in the same class for 2-2 years
 kyonki online farm nahin bharne ke kaaran imtahaan hi nahin de sakate hai
 It was also heard that when the students go to the Vice Chancellor with a problem, they drink coffee
 samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota magar samasya sunne kii ek yojana he jiskaa naam he 'coffee vid visi'
 This program is being organized in all the colleges of this university
 akhabaaron main khabar chhapati he ki aaj falaan college main 'coffee vid visi' he
 The Vice Chancellor will hear the students' problem
 samaadhaan nahin hota magar hedline ban jaati he
 You must be wondering where we reached Kolhan
 aap darshakon main se hi koi hamen yahaan se vahaan le ja rahaa he
 On August 13, 2009, the state government approved the position of 22 professors, 44 associate professors, 88 assistant professors for 22 departments of this university
 aaj tak yahaan kisi bhi sthaayee bahaali nahin hui he
 There are 22 teachers who have been brought here through transfers
 paryaavaran ko lekar ham kitne gambhir ho jate hai magar sthaneey media kii report se pataa chalaa ki yahaan paryaavaran vigyaan padhaane ke liye master hi nahin he
 There are 350 students in the Hindi department but only 2 are there to teach
 raajnneeti vibhaag main 300 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf ek hai
 University is formed for tribal society, there is no teacher for tribal studies
 ye chutkula sirf sarkarein hi suna sakati hai apni janata ko
 The public also continues to laugh and the leaders go away with their idols
 kuch college main computer lab he magar lab khulte hi nahin he
 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave
 akhbaar main hedline chap jaati he ki digital india ho gaya he
 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination
 aisa kam hi suna hoga ki pehle degree bant gai or phir imtahaan ho rahaa he
 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us
 jamshedpur mahila college kaa haal bhi aap sun lijie
 This college, formed in 1953, has 9000 students
 1977 ke baad se yaha padon kii sankhya nahin badi he jabaki chaatraon kii sankhya kai guna bad gai he
 There should be 57 teachers but there are only 34 teachers
 46 guest teacher padhaa rahe hai jinhen maheene main 5000 se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 Those taking post graduate classes are getting a salary of five thousand
 jo piji toppers hota he usee ko padhaane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Details of teachers in some other colleges of this university have come to know that 84 posts are approved in Tata College Chaibasa but there are only 25 teachers
 mahila college chibasa main 40 pad manzur hai magar 15 shikshak hi hai
 Ghatshila College, Ghatshila has 40 posts, but only 18 teachers
 2008 ke baad se in collejon main niyukti hi nahin hui he
 Wherever appointments are being done, they are happening very slowly
 saare pad nahin bhare ja rahe hai
 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie
 Neither is a teacher here at 300 students
 jharkhand ke kolhaan se chalate hai mumbai
 Everything must be right there
 130 saal puraani he yah mumbai uniwarsity
 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar
 rajyapal ne aadesh diya ki 31 agast tak riselt ghoshit ho janaa chahie

 Harbans said that 75 percent of tribal students come here cycling from 40-40 km away
 ye sabhi saranda ilaake se aate hai
 Where even today, the mobile tower does not work properly
 uniwarsity main online farm bharne kii vyavastha to aa gai he magar network na hone ke kaaran kai chaatr farm nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to which many students are stuck in the same class for 2-2 years
 kyonki online farm nahin bharne ke kaaran imtahaan hi nahin de sakate hai
 It was also heard that when the students go to the Vice Chancellor with a problem, they drink coffee
 samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota magar samasya sunne kii ek yojana he jiskaa naam he 'coffee vid visi'
 This program is being organized in all the colleges of this university
 akhabaaron main khabar chhapati he ki aaj falaan college main 'coffee vid visi' he
 The Vice Chancellor will hear the students' problem

 You must be wondering where we reached Kolhan

 On August 13, 2009, the state government approved the position of 22 professors, 44 associate professors, 88 assistant professors for 22 departments of this university

 paryaavaran ko lekar ham kitne gambhir ho jate hai magar sthaneey media kii report se pataa chalaa ki yahaan paryaavaran vigyaan padhaane ke liye master hi nahin he
 There are 350 students in the Hindi department but only 2 are there to teach
 raajnneeti vibhaag main 300 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf ek hai
 University is formed for tribal society, there is no teacher for tribal studies
 ye chutkula sirf sarkarein hi suna sakati hai apni janata ko
 The public also continues to laugh and the leaders go away with their idols
 kuch college main computer lab he magar lab khulte hi nahin he
 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave
 akhbaar main hedline chap jaati he ki digital india ho gaya he
 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination
 aisa kam hi suna hoga ki pehle degree bant gai or phir imtahaan ho rahaa he
 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us

 This college, formed in 1953, has 9000 students
 1977 ke baad se yaha padon kii sankhya nahin badi he jabaki chaatraon kii sankhya kai guna bad gai he

 Wherever appointments are being done, they are happening very slowly

 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie
 Neither is a teacher here at 300 students
 jharkhand ke kolhaan se chalate hai mumbai
 Everything must be right there
 130 saal puraani he yah mumbai uniwarsity
 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you

 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar
 rajyapal ne aadesh diya ki 31 agast tak riselt ghoshit ho janaa chahie
 Meanwhile, the Chief Minister and the Education Minister also gave orders, but nothing happened
 june main jo rigelt aa janaa chahie tha wo aayaa 19 sitambar ko
 In Maharashtra, the rule is that the result should come within 30 to 45 days of the examination
 iske baad bhi 2300 chaatro ke nattejey abhi tak nahin aae hai
 While the second season has started
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 3700 uttar pustikaayen gaayab ho gai hai
 This year, the university decided that all the results would be checked online
 shikshakon ke paas training nahin thi or shikshak bhi paryaapt nahin the
 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced
 unka kahana he ki unka paper acha hua tha
 Students are demanding a double check
 tippaniyan Like Delhi University, Mumbai University is also relying on ad hoc teachers
 yahaan jis tarah pad khaali hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki sarkaron kii nitiyon ke do charan he
 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case
 mumbai uniwarsity main 86 professor hone chahie magar hai sirf 35
 Professor has 51 vacancies
 sahaayak professor hone chahien 279 magar hai sirf 170
 You must be thinking that there will be some university which will be of the kind, where all the teachers will be there, we have not found them, you can tell which is such a university
 aap soch rahe honge ki ham kolhaan kahaan pahunch gaye
 Someone in the audience is taking us from here to there
 13 agast, 2009 ko is uniwarsity ke 22 vibhaagon ke liye 22 professor, 44 associat professor, 88 sahaayak professor ke pad ke liye rajya sarkaar ne sweekruti di thi
 Till date there has not been any permanent restoration here
 22 teacher hai jinhen tabadale ke zarie yahaan laayaa gaya he
 How serious we get about the environment, but local media reports showed that there is no master to teach environmental science here
 hindi vibhaag main 350 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf 2 hai
 There are 300 students in the Department of Politics but there is only one to teach
 janajaatiy samaaj ke liye uniwarsity banati he, janajaatiy adhyayan ke liye bhi shikshak nahin he
 Only governments can tell these jokes to their people
 janata bhi hansatii rah jaati he or netaa apni murti banavaa kar chale jate hai
 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all
 netaa aate hai or lab kaa udghaatan karke chale jate hai
 The headline is printed in the newspaper that Digital India is done
 ye khabar isliye chhapi he ki kolhaan uniwarsity main pichdi kii degree pehle baant di gai or imtahaan baad main liya gaya
 It has been published in the newspaper that the Controller of Examinations of Kolhan University issued a strange notification on September 8, 2017
 isamen piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kar chuke shodharthiyon ko bhi corsework kii pariksha ke liye aavedan karne ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 It is rarely heard that the degree is divided first and then the examination is being done
 zaruri he ki ham or aap taj mahal ke masale ko lekar uljhe rahe taaki vyavasthaaen hamen bevakoof banaati rahen
 You can also listen to the condition of Jamshedpur Women's College
 1953 main bane is kalege main 9000 chatraayen padhati hai
 The number of posts has not increased since 1977, while the number of girl students has increased manifold
 yahaan par 57 shikshak hone chahie magar hai 34 shikshak hi
 There are 46 guest teachers who cannot get more than 5000 a month
 post graduate kii class lene vaale ko paanch hazaar kii selary mil rahi he
 Those who are PG toppers are asked to teach the same

 There are 40 posts sanctioned in the women's college Chaibasa but only 15 teachers
 ghatshila college, ghatshila main 40 pad manzur hai magar 18 shikshak hi hai
 There has been no appointment in these colleges since 2008
 abhi jahaan bhi niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai wo bahut dhimi gati se ho rahi hai
 Not all posts are being filled
 har jagah ek shikshak par chaatro kii sankhya itani he ki koi bhi vishwa stareey chhodie zila stareey top college banane kaa sapana nahin dekh saktaa
 According to the guide lines drawn by the UGC, a teacher in a university that dreams of becoming world class should have only 20 students
 yahaan na to 300 chaatro par ek teacher he
 Mumbai runs from Kolhan in Jharkhand
 vahaan to sab kuch thik hi hona chahie
 This University of Mumbai is 130 years old

 It is counted among the large universities in India
 ye jawahar laal nehru librari he
 The building is fine but the condition inside is bad
 deevaaron par daraaren padi hui hai
 The roof drips during the rainy season
 duusari manzil kaa ek slab tut chukaa he
 Leave repair, no one has even picked up the debris
 yahaan par khel-kud ke saamaan to hai magar khilne ke liye jagah nahin he
 You yourself see its condition

 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education
 aapke hukmaranon, netaaon ne aapako fansaa diya he
 Now you can't get out of it
 isse nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he ki aap apana dhyaan hindu-muslim jaise masalon main lagaaein
 Sohit Mishra is now taking you to the Bhavan Bhawan built on the University campus
 jane kaa rasta bhi nahin he
 Sohit brings you here, avoiding any kind of slipping
 kisi ko ghaas bhi nazar nahin aati he
 Mumbai University seems to have declared himself dead

 The campus of Bhasha Bhawan has been built in 2015, the building is lying in this way

 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you

 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai
 It cannot be a big positive story
 mumbai uniwarsity main ek vivaad bhi chal rahaa he
 Results of all subjects should have come here by 15 June
 jab rigelt nahin aayaa to hangaamaa hone laga
 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August
 is bich mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri ne bhi aadesh die magar kuch nahin hua
 The result that should have come in June came on 19 September
 maharashtra main niyam he ki pariksha hone ke 30 se 45 din ke bheetar riselt aa janaa chahie
 Even after this, the results of 2300 students are yet to come
 jabaki doosraa satr shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 3700 answer sheets have disappeared

 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar
 rajyapal ne aadesh diya ki 31 agast tak riselt ghoshit ho janaa chahie
 Meanwhile, the Chief Minister and the Education Minister also gave orders, but nothing happened
 june main jo rigelt aa janaa chahie tha wo aayaa 19 sitambar ko
 In Maharashtra, the rule is that the result should come within 30 to 45 days of the examination
 iske baad bhi 2300 chaatro ke nattejey abhi tak nahin aae hai
 While the second season has started
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 3700 uttar pustikaayen gaayab ho gai hai
 This year, the university decided that all the results would be checked online
 shikshakon ke paas training nahin thi or shikshak bhi paryaapt nahin the
 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced
 unka kahana he ki unka paper acha hua tha
 Students are demanding a double check
 tippaniyan Like Delhi University, Mumbai University is also relying on ad hoc teachers
 yahaan jis tarah pad khaali hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki sarkaron kii nitiyon ke do charan he
 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case

 Properly implementing the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana remains a challenge for the NDA government
 gramin vikaas mantralay ke mutabik is vakt 112 saansad aise hai jinhone saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat kisi gram panchayat kaa chayan aaj tak nahin kiya he
 On October 11 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Saansad Adarsh gram Yojana
 us vakt ye tay kiya gaya tha ki sabhi saansad ek maheene ke andar 11 november (2014) tak apane-apane ilaake main ek gram panchayat kaa chayan karenge jise 2016 tak adarsh gram ke taur par viksit kiya jayega
 But according to the Ministry of Rural Development, at present there are 112 mps who have not selected any Gram Panchayat under the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana
 kuch saansadon ko dar he ki agar unhone apane ilaake main kisi ek gaanv ta chayan kiya to ilaake main padane vaale duusare gaanvon ke log unke naaraaz ho jaaenge
 According to government data, the worst condition of the MP Adarsh gram Yojana is in West Bengal
 rajya main 42 main se 39 saansadon ne gram panchayat kaa chunaav ab tak nahin kiya he
 Trinamool MP and former railway minister Dinesh Trivedi told NDTV, 'I cannot do favors
 mujhe nahin pataa ki gaanv ke chayan kii prakriya kya he? meri najar main mere sansadeey kshetra main har gaanv ko adarsh gaanv kii tarah viksit karnaa zaruri he
 Comments kuch saansad is yojana ko vyavhaarik nahin maanate
 JD-U national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP KC Tyagi said that mps do not have enough funds to invest all the money in one village
 saath hi, kisi ek gaanv par zyaada dhyaan dene se duusare gaanv vaale naaraaz ho sakate hai, unamem irshyaa kii bhaavana paidaa ho sakati he
 It would not be appropriate to do so from a political point of view
 gaanv naa chunane vaale har saansad kii apni daleel he - kahin vajah raajnneetik he, to kahin prashasnic
 But the result of this is that the deadline that was in place to implement this scheme is being left behind and it is becoming difficult to meet its target
 pichley saal 11 oktober ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne saansad adarsh gram yojana launch kii thi
 At that time it was decided that all the mps would choose a Gram Panchayat in their respective areas within a month by 11 November (2014) which would be developed as Adarsh gram by 2016
 lekin gramin vikaas mantralay ke mutabik is vakt 112 saansad aise hai jinhone saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat kisi gram panchayat kaa chayan nahin kiya he
 Some mps fear that if they choose one village in their area, then people from other villages falling in the area will get angry with them
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik saansad adarsh gram yojana kaa sabase bura haal pashchim bengal main he
 39 out of 42 mps in the state have not yet elected Gram Panchayat
 trinmul saansad or purv rail mantri dinesh trivedi ne enditivi se kaha, 'main pakshpaat nahin kar saktaa
 i do not know what is the process of village selection? According to me, every village in my parliamentary constituency needs to be developed as an ideal village
 ' tippaniyan Some mps do not consider this scheme practical
 jedy-you ke rashtriya pravaktaa or rajya sabha saansad ke si tyaagi ne kaha ki saansadon ke paas itane funds nahin hote ki wo sara paisa kisi ek gaanv main laga den
 Also, paying more attention to one village may offend others, causing a sense of envy in them
 aisa karnaa raajnneetik drushtikon se uchit nahin hoga
 Every MP who does not choose a village has his own argument - somewhere the reason is political, somewhere administrative
 lekin iskaa nateeja ye hua he ki is yojana ko lagu karne ke liye jo dedline thi wo peeche chhuti ja rahi he or iske torget ko puraa karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he

 Ever since the change of power took place in China through the armed revolution under the leadership of Mao Zedang and since then Mao's ideas have been paramount here, but now the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi, the priest of Truth and non-violence, have started getting place
 isaki misaal aaj us vakt dekhne ko mili jab baapu ke vichaaron par aadhaarit ek pustak kaa vimochan kiya gaya
 The book is titled 'gandhi's Outstanding Leadership'
 purv bhartiya rajanyik or gandhivadi paasak alan najareth dwaara likhi is pustak kaa vimochan peking vishvavidhyalay ke ‘centre for india studies’ main kiya gaya
 Indian Ambassador S
 Jaishankar was also present on the occasion
 south china normal uniwarsity ke itihaas ke professor shang kuanew ne is pustak kaa anuwaad chini bhashaa main kiya he
 Indian officials say that in many respects this book is Mao's 'official arrival' of Gandhian ideas in China
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki yah pehla mauka he jab china main kisi pustak kaa chini bhashaa main aadhikarik anumati se vimochan kiya gaya he
 Last year, American journalist William L
 Schierr's book 'gandhi Ek Memoir' appeared in the market here
 gandhi ke vichaaron par aadhaarit pustak ke lekhak najareth saal 1994 main bhartiya videsh seva se sevanivrutt hue the
 He said that Gandhi's views are relevant to the whole world, especially China
 pustak ke vimochan ke maukey par unhone is baat kaa ullekh kiya ki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay baapu ne kis tarah se china par japan ke hamale kaa virodh kiya tha
 At that time, the Mahatma had written in a letter to the people of Japan, 'you people are clinging to imperialist ambition
 ’ najareth ne kaha ki gandhi kaa darshan china ke liye praasangik he kyonki aarthik vikaas ke baad yah desh bahut adhik upabhoktavaad kaa anubhav kar rahaa he
 During a conversation with the students here, they had to face many complex questions about the poles, contrary to Mao's idea of grabbing power on arms and Gandhi's idea of non-violence

 The parliamentary examination of the central government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is starting from Monday
 modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa sansad satr somvaar yani 17 june se shuru hokar 26 july tak chalegaa
 In this session of Parliament lasting 40 days, there will be a challenge to pass many important Bills
 sarkaar bajet satr main teen talaak, kendriya shaikshanik santhaan aarakshan or naagarikta sanshodhan jaise kai ahm bill ko pesh karegi
 With the government having sufficient strength in the Lok Sabha, this bill will be easily passed in the lower house of Parliament, but the biggest challenge will be to pass it from Rajya Sabha
 teen talaak bilcendre main duusari baar bani modi sarkaar ke agenda main sabase ahm teen talaak bill he
 This is the reason why the government approved the ordinance in the first meeting of the cabinet to rid Muslim women of triple talaq, after which it will now present it in the Lok Sabha
 haalanki saal 2017 main sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon ke adhikaar se jude is bill ko loksabhaa se paarit kara liya tha lekin rajyasabha se paas nahin ho saki thi or yah bill ucch sadan ne waapas bhej diya tha
 After this, the government had also brought an ordinance for it, which was naturally repealed after the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki ek baar main teen talaak se jude ordinance ko piem narendra modi kii adhyakshata main hui cabinet kii baithak main manjuuri di gai
 It also includes some of the opposition's demands
 darasal pichley satr main jab sarkaar ne antim din rajyasabha main is bill ko pesh kiya tha to vipaksh ne yah kahkar bill paas nahin hone diya ki sarkaar ne bahut hi hadabadi main bina sabaki sahmati ke is vidheyak ko pesh kar diya he
 Now it will be presented by the Modi government in the budget session of Parliament, to see if this bill will be passed by both the houses after amendment
 jammu-kashmir aarakshan vidheyakanarendra modi sarkaar bajet satr main jammu-kashmir rigerveshan bill 2019 ko pesh karegi
 The bill will provide relief to people living near the international border in Jammu and Kashmir
 cabinet kii pehali baithak main modi sarkaar ne ordinance ke jariye isamen sanshodhan kiya he
 Actually, the cabinet has changed the provision of reservation by changing the Presidential Order of 1954 for reservation there
 iske tahat jammu-kashmir main niyantran rekha ke paas rahane vaale logon ke saath-saath ab antarrashtriya seemaa par rahane vaale logon ko bhi aarakshan kaa laabh milegaa
 Apart from this, 10 percent reservation for the poor will also be applicable and SC, ST and OBC reservation will also be applicable
 kendriya shaikshanik santhaan aarakshan bilvishvavidhyalay main niyukti ko lekar hue roster vivaad par modi sarkaar ne cabinet main dobaaraa ordinance jari kiya he
 After this, the government will now introduce the Central Educational Institutions Reservation Bill in the Lok Sabha
 isse saath hi purana system 200 point roster behaal ho jayega
 Under this, a university or college would be considered a unit rather than a department or subject
 is nirnay se shikshak kader main sidhi bhartee ke tahat 7000 se adhik rictiyon ko bharte samay yah sunishchit kiya ja sakegaa ki essi, asti or obisi ko aarakshan kaa laabh mil sake
 Citizenship Amendment Bill: The amendment bill related to citizenship is also in the top list of the government, but this bill has not been approved by the Parliament in the last term
 saal 2016 main sarkaar ne is bill ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha lekin phir ise sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke paas bhej diya gaya tha
 Now the government will bring it back to parliament again
 sarogesi regulation bilimodi sarkaar saal 2016 main sarogesi ke durupyog ko rokane ke masakad se yah bill lekar ai thi
 The bill was also introduced in the Lok Sabha in January 2017 but after all the objections, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee, since then the bill has been hanging in Parliament
 sarkaar ne is bill ko loksabhaa se paarit kara liya tha, lekin rajyasabha se paas nahin ho sakaa
 In such a situation, after the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha, the government can bring this bill for the second time
 mahila aarakshan bilsansad main kareeb 22 saal se mahilaon ko sansad or vidhansabhaon main 33 fisadi aarakshan dene se judaa bill lataka hua he
 In the year 2010, this bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha during the UPA government but due to opposition from parties like Samajwadi Party, BSP and Rashtriya Janata Dal in the Lok Sabha, this bill could not be passed
 yah bill 1996 main ech di devegoda sarkaar ne pehali baar pesh kiya tha or tab kai purush saansadon ne iskaa baari virodh kiya tha
 In such a situation, Congress may pressurize the Modi government by demanding the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill
 haalanki modi sarkaar ne pichley paanch saal ke kaarykaal main is disha main kadam nahin badha saki thi
 While he had a majority in the Lok Sabha and this time there are enough numbers
 is tarah se mana ja saktaa he ki mahila aarakshan bill modi sarkaar ke paale main he
 Let us know that apart from these bills, Modi government has many bills like Indian Medical Council Amendment, Company and Banning of Unregulated Deposit Scheme
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki modi sarkaar is bajet satr main kin-kin vidheyakon ko paas karaane main safal rahati he
 Husbands have many habits that wives do not like
 ye baaten hoti to choti hi hai lekin kai baar ye aise str par pahunch jaati hai jahaan do logon ke bich jhagade kii sthiti khadi ho jaati he
 For a happy married life, it is very important that the husband and wife understand what makes their partner happy and what makes them angry
 ye baat jaananaa jitna pati ke liye jaruri he utana hi patni ke liye bhi
 These are five such things that annoy women the most
 agar aap bhi apni patni se aisa kuch kehete hai to
 
 
 1
 tum acchhee lag rahi ho par meri maa jaisi khubasurat nahin
 If you want to tease your wife, there is no need to say anything more than this
 aisa na ho ki aapke aisa baar-baar kehane se wo itani pareshaan ho jaae ki aapse apane bare main poochna hi band kar de
 2
 kya aap jaanate hai jab aap apane doston kii patniyon kii tarif usase karte hai to use kaisaa lagata he? zyaadaatar mardon ko ye pataa hi nahin hota he ki in baton se mahilaon ko sakht nafrat he auraunhen apane pati ke munh se kisi bhi duusari aurat kii tarif sunanaa bilkul pasand nahin hota he
 3
 kai gharon main aisa hota he ki purush jaise hi offis se ghar lautate hai, tivi kaa remot lekar baith jate hai
 Or quickly change the wife's favorite soap opera
 kya aap jaanate hai aapaki is aadat par aapaki patni ko kitna gussa aata he?4
 Most men have the habit that they do not keep their belongings in an orderly manner
 geeli tauliya bistar par, gande mojey sofe ke neeche or na jane kya-kya
 The wife who keeps the house decorated does not like this habit of the husband at all
 5
 Do not accept your mistake
 kai baar aisa hota he ki saamne vaale ko pataa hota he ki wo galat he baavjood iske wo ye sweekaar nahin karata he
 Women also suffer from the habit of not accepting the mistake of men

 shaam saat baje ke aas-paas unki do beti ghar waapas aa gai jabaki choti beti un logon ke saath nahin thi
 The father said that when he asked the children, they told that Ramchandra Thakur of the village had taken him in his lap and he said that he will bring home
 iske baad pita ne ghar se nikalakar gaanv main kaaphi khojbin kii lekin vah nahin mili
 Not only this, many people of the village kept searching for her daughter at night, later on further inquiry it was found that Ramchandra Thakur was also not at home
 jaanch main saamne aayaa ki ladki ke pita or ramchandra thakur ke pita madhu thakur ke bich vivaad chal rahaa he
 For this reason, his daughter is kidnapped by Ramchandra Thakur and Madhu Thakur
