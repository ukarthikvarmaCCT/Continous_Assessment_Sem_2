 britain ke stant baajon ne krishna nadi main stant kiya
 Many people came to see the show
 flite stants ko dekhakar wo bhi excited ho gaye
 Call it the seat of fate or something else, Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Union Minister Shashi Tharoor, won the headlines as she won, now she is in the same headlines even after death
 garaj ye ki sunanda kii maut koi maamuli maut nahin he
 Sunanda, who is going through the stress of relationship with her husband, went to sleep, but was it a coincidence or was it that alcohol and sleeping pills became the reason for Sunanda's death? January 17 from Hotel Leela in Delhi At night, a puzzle of death has come out, which is no longer solved
 haalanki shuruaati postmortem report or ab tak kii chaanbin se ye baat saaf ho gai he ki maut se pehle sunanda ne sharaab pi thi or saath main neend kii goliyaan bhi lee thim, lekin kya sharaab or neend kii yahi goliyaan unki maut kii vajah bani yaa phir maut kii vajah kuch or rahi
 This question is still unresolved
 ames ke doctoron ne postmortem ke baad sunanda kaa visra jaanch ke liye bhijwaya he or unka kahana he ki visra report ke saamne aate hi maut kii asli vajah bhi saaf ho jaaegi, lekin esadm kii chaanbin se ye saaf hua he ki sunanda or shashi tharur ke bich aakhri dinon main rishte koi bahut achche nahin the
 Rather, there was a fierce clash between the two about Pakistani journalist Meher Tarar till a few hours before his death and all this went on for hours
 sutron kii maane to 15 janvari ko sunanda apane pati ke saath tiruanantpuram se dilli pahunchi thi or rastebhar donon ke bich meher ko lekar ladaai hoti rahi
 Moreover, after reaching Delhi, the fight between Sunanda and Tharoor increased so much that Sunanda started crying bitterly at the airport and she locked herself in the wash room of the airport
 haalanki tab tharur bhi kuch der tak wash room ke baahar sunanda kaa intjaar karte rahe, lekin sunanda nahin nikali
 After this, when Tharoor left from there, Sunanda came out and reached the Hotel Leela Palace directly from the airport
 yahaan unhone apane liye cameraa book karvaa liya
 Though Tharoor also reached Hotel Leela after some time, it was due to the bitterness of the relationship that despite the wife being in the same hotel, the two stayed in different rooms that day
 agle din halaat thode badal chuke the
 Tharoor managed to persuade Sunanda and on this day both of them booked a room number 345 in the same hotel
 iske baad donon saath rahe or phir 17 janvari ko shashi tharur eisisi kii meeting main shaamil hone ke liye hotel se baahar chale gaye, lekin sunanda ke dil main ab bhi uthal-puthal chal rahi thi
 So, even on this day, he did not like to meet more than anyone and kept resting in the hotel room
 sunanda pehle hi biimaar thim or kaaphi kamjor bhi ho gai thim
 She was also very upset due to the fighting and fighting from above
 haal ke dinon main wo cigarette ke saath sharaab bhi pi rahi thi or unhone thik se khaanaa tak nahin khaaya tha, lekin 17 janvari ko shaam hote-hote jo kuch hua, usne sirf tharur parivaar hi nahin, balki puure desh ko sakate main daal liya
 Suddenly Sunanda Pushkar's body was found from that room
 sunanda pushkar kii maut kii khabar se puure hotel main hadakamp much chukaa tha
 Shashi Tharoor immediately summoned a doctor for examination, but by then it was late
 udhar, tharur ne apane pies abhinav kumaar ko phone par isaki ittila di or abhinav ne police ko sunanda kii maut ke bare main bataaya
 By then, the news of Sunanda's death, which came out of hotel room number 345, had spread across the country
 maut ke baad chaanbin ke dauraan ye bhi saaf hua ki 16 or 17 kii darmyaani raat ko sunanda ne telephone par do mahila patrakaron se baat kii thi
 One of these senior journalist Nalini Singh has confirmed that at that time Sunanda was upset about her health and relationship with Tharoor and was crying on the phone
 philhal esadm ne in donon patrakaron ke saath-saath sunanda ke pati or kendriya mantri shashi tharur ke bayaan bhi darj kiye hai
 Along with this, Shashi Tharoor's brother and his PA, while Sunanda and Shashi Tharoor's two attendants Narayan and Bajrangi have also recorded their statements and in view of all these statements, forensic evidence and circumstances, now the investigating officer is now real about the death of Sunanda

 Nitish Kumar has fiercely attacked Narendra Modi and BJP amidst the heat of the Lok Sabha elections
 modi par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye bihar ke siem nitish ne sahaara liya he soshal media kaa
 In his post on Facebook, Nitish has said that BJP first duped Ram, now it is Mahadev's turn
 yani varanasi seat se modi kii ummidavaari ab nitish ko bhi khatakane lagi he
 Nitish has termed BJP of Modi's party as 'bhasmasur'
 nitish ne fasebuk par likhaa he, 'bijepi bihar main prapanch kaa jaal bun rahi he
 In Bihar, which is the link of the origin of many religions, BJP is insulting the chanting of Har Har Mahadev to bring political propaganda
 unke mukhya netaa upree taur par to kah rahe hai ki aise naare nahin lagaayenge par puure bihar main parche baant rahe hai
 When Bhasmasura too would have done penance, he would not have insulted the chanting of every Mahadev
 magar bijepi to bhasmasur se bhi do kadam aage nikal gai he
 There was no stone unturned in cheating Lord Rama, now he has also started following Lord Shiva
 jab bhagwaan nahin batch rahe to insaan kya bachenge?'modi or bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue siem aage likhte hai, 'hawa banaate hai ki bihar ko ye denge wo denge, shart rakhte hai ki mukhyamantri ko maafee maangana hoga or iske baavjood puure bihar main parche bantwate hai ‘vishesh sahyog evam vishesh package denge modi’
 We will take the status of Bihari special state - we have the right
 baat bilkul thos he or spasht bhi
 This will create industries in Bihar, provide employment to our youth, and also provide resources to the state government to run new programs of development
 ham vikaas kii wo raftaar pakadenge ki desh ke ausat str tak pahunch jaaen
 But, BJP can neither give it, nor want to give it, but in Bihar it is spreading confusion and lies by saying 'special attention, special cooperation and special package' etc
 'nitish ne likhaa he, 'kamaal he! bihar kii janata ek karod 18 lakh hastakshar kare, patna or dilli main adhikaar raily main lakhon kii maatra main apana mat rakhe, sankalp reliyon main vishesh rajya kaa sankalp le – or bijepi kaa jawaab kya he, maafee maango or bheekh bhi
 There can be no more humiliation and deception than this
 ye parchaa jo bijepi bihar main ghar ghar baant rahi he, ye har bihari ke apmaan kaa certificate he jise koodaydaan main phenk dena chahie
 By doing this, our self-respect will also be saved and Mahadev will also be respected

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strategy of raising the name of Sardar Patel and bashing the Congress for this was beneficial for Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) itself
 narendra modi kii jeet main sardaar patel kaa ahm yogadan rahaa he
 In the name of Patel, the issue of nationalism was almost hit by Modi, but he was taken away from the Congress
 sardaar patelcongress ke adhyaksh bhi rahe patelmehaan swatantraaa senaanee or desh ke pehle purv uppradhanmantri sardaar patel aaajeevan congressi rahe, lekin unki maut ke kareeb 7 dashak baad vah apni hi party se dur hote ja rahe hai
 Sardar was very successful as a lawyer but later he got inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and jumped into the freedom movement
 1918 main sardaar patel kheda andolan ke jariye charchaa main aae
 Through this movement, he demanded a tax exemption for the farmers of Kheda region who were affected by the drought
 sardaar patel, mahatma gandhi or anya logon ne kisaanon kaa netritv kiya or unhen kar na dene ke liye prarit kiya
 Later the British government had to bow down and farmers were given tax relief
 patel ko bardoli satyagrah se sardaar kii oopaadhi mili or gandhi ke saath lagaataar swatantraaa andolan main jude rahe
 Patel was elected president in the Karachi session of the Congress in 1931
 aazaadee ke baad vah pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron main the, lekin pandit jawahar laal nehru pradhanmantri bane
 He remained associated with the Congress even after several controversies

 The condition of the Congress has become extremely pathetic
 kai rajyon main congress kii sthiti aisi ban gai he ki unke paas bijepi ke khilaaf maidan main utaarne ke liye yogya ummidavaar tak nahin mil rahe hai
 Narendra Modi has been crediting Sardar Patel for the integration of India after independence
 pradhanmantri banane se pehle 2013 main sardaar patel kii jayanti ke avasar par kaha tha ki dal koi bhi ho, dil desh kaa hona chahie
 Then he said that the country needs the secularism of Sardar Patel

 nae saal kii subah jab log ek-duusare ko badhaaiyaan dene main mashgool the, tab dilli se chand kilometre ke faasale par haryana ke ek gaanv se chaunkaane vaali khabar ai
 a burnt car was lying on a deserted road in the village and there were four corpses in the car
 lekin ye koi haadasa nahin tha, balki ek ek sochi-samajhi saazish thi
 That is, all four were killed
 qatl, or wo bhi gangvaar ke chalate
 Isheri village, Haryana, near Delhi
 vaqt subah ke 09
 30 o'clock
 janvari kii is sard subah main zindagi ab bhi unindi thi
 It was the first day of the year
 ek to new year party kii khumaari or upar se dhundh or badal ne jaise vakt ko bhi peeche roak diya tha
 But in the same cold morning, the people of the village looked at such a scene that their footsteps came to a halt
 gaanv kii sunsaan kachi sadak par gaye ek car thi, jo puri tarah se jali hui thi, balki isse ab bhi halkaa dhuaan nikal rahaa tha
 Counting the dead body was also difficult; it seemed like an accident
 jisamen koi car raste main chalate-chalate achaanak aag kii lapaton main ghir gai or raakh ban gai
 But when the people of the village reached close to this car with the intention of knowing the cause of this incident, Rongte stood looking at the inside
 is car main laashen padi thim
 Yes, the dead bodies are not one, but many people
 lekin aag kii vajah se in laashon kii haalat aisi thi ki unhen pahachaanaa to dur, fori taur par ye samajhnaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa tha ki akhir is car main thik kitni laashen hai
 Meanwhile, Bahadurgarh police and forensic teams arrived on the spot as soon as the news was received and when people closely inspected the car, it was clear that no one or two, but four people died in the car fire
 happened
 yani aadhi raat aag kii lapaton main ghiri ye car main ek saath chaar-chaar logon kii chita ban gai thi
 There was no corpse in the front seat but till now the puzzle of the death of four people in this car was swinging between the incident and the conspiracy, due to the minute inspection of the occasion, it was cleared to a great extent
 garaz ye ki car main laashen beshak chaar logon kii thim, lekin ek bhi laash driving seat yaa phir uske bagalvaali seat par nahin thi
 Rather two corpses were on the back seat of the car while two more were lying in the car's diggy
 yani ek baat to takreeban saafe thi ki ye car raste main chalate-chalate achaanak kisi takneekee kharabi kii vajah se nahin jali or naa hi is car main savaar log kisi haadase kaa shikaar bane
 Because if something like this happens, the bodies of at least two out of four people would surely have been found on the front seat of the car
 gangvaar kaa anjaam!lekin yahaan to maamla ajeeb tha
 There were two corpses on the back seat of the car, while two more corpses in the car's Diggi
 ab chunki jite-ji do log car kii diggi main nahin ghus kar nahin jal sakate the
 It was also clear that someone took the life of these four and set them on fire along with the car
 lekin akhir aisa karanevaale log koun ho sakate the? or kaise ek saath chaar-chaar logon ko yun koi car samet jala saktaa tha? zaahir he, ye naa to kisi ek qaatil kaa kaam tha or naa hi aisa lagata tha ki car main savaar tamaam log zindaa jaale the, balki police ko shaq tha ki unhen to kisi ne maut ke ghat utaar kar is car main hi jala diya tha, taaki maut ke baad unki pahchaan bhi naammumkin ho jaae
 Police first tried to trace the owner of the car from the number plate and then from the chassis number
 or is koshish main jald hi police ko ye baat pataa chal gai ki dilli number kii ye car dilli ke ek gaanv mitrau kii he
 And then because of this clue, not only were the victims soon identified, but the story behind these deaths also shocked the police
 kyonki, ye koi maamuli vaardaat nahin, balki ek kaufanaak gangvaar kaa anjaam tha
 Here, news of the death of four boys came out and a fifth boy came in front of the police
 uskaa kahana tha ki maut se pehle usne apane doston kii aakiri chikh suni thi
 a friend of his from his mobile phone told that he was surrounded by his enemies and after that his phone was switched off
 pehle maari gai goli!haryana police ne car ke registration number DL8CAF 7229 or chasis number kii badaulat gaadi ke maalik kii pahchaan to pataa kar lee
 But he still had to go through many problems before it could be resolved completely
 is bich farensik jaanch ke dauraan police ko car se hi ek goli bhi baraamad hui
 There was already suspicion of murder behind these four deaths, but the bullet from the car confirmed this suspicion a little more
 kyonki goli kaa milanaa is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahaa tha ki in ladakon ko car samet aag ke hawaale karne se pehle unhen goliyon kaa nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 And in such a situation, either these bullets came out of someone's body after burning or they were shot in the car or some of them were shot
 udhar, din chadhane ke saath hi car samet gaayab hue chaaron naujavaanon kii pahchaan saafe ho gai
 These boys were Manish, Sandeep, Sudhir of Mitrau, a village in Delhi and Deepak of village Samaspur
 deepak kii umr to abhi mahaz 17 saal kii bataai gai
 But the way corpses were found in the car, it is suspected that he also became a victim of murderers along with his friends
 bahadurgard police ke bataane par in ladakon ke gharavaale bhi maukey par pahunche or unhone laashon ko pahchaanane kii koshish kii
 But the way these bodies were burnt, their identification was also difficult
 yahi vajah thi ki gharavaalon ne laashon ko dekhne ke baad phir se dilli pahunch kar police ke paas apane bacchon kii gumshudagi kii report likhavai
 But the police in the investigation had already suspected gang-rape behind this incident, the family members of some boys who had disappeared from the house along with the car were also confirming this theory
 unhone naa sirf kai or ladakon par is vaardaat main shaamil hone kaa shaq jataayaa, balki ye bhi bataaya ki kuch sandigdh ladke 31 disambar kii raat gaanv main dekhe gaye the
 Now for the last time the police was looking for the person who saw these boys i
e
 Manish, Sandeep, Sudhir and Deepak alive
 
 
 taaki unke gaanv yani mitrau se lekar mauka-e-vaardaat yani gaanv ishrhedi tak ke safar kii puri kahani kuch saafe ho sake
 There was a fight in the party on December 31
 Meanwhile, the police came to know of another shocking thing
 sutron kii maane to tafteesh ke dauraan police ko ek shaks aisa mila, jisane qatl kii raat in ladakon ke saath phone par hi gangvaar kii baat suni thi
 Actually, these four boys had gathered in their village on the night of 31 December for a New Year party at the house of a boy named Bhupesh
 jahaan sabane saath main hi drinks or dinar liya tha
 And around 12:30 these four left from there
 lekin iske baad raat ke kareeb 1 bajkar 23 minute par sudhir ne bhupesh ko apane mobile phone se kol kar ye bataaya ki unka gaanv ke hi kuch ladakon ke saath jhagada ho gaya he or wo buree tarah ghir chuke hai
 After this, Bhupesh has told the police that the mobile phones of his three friends Manish, Sandeep and Deepak along with Sudhir were mysteriously switched off
 or ab duusare din jis tarah se sandip kii car main chaar logon kii laashen milin, usase use shaq he ki in chaaron kaa qatl kiya gaya he, balki beeti raat qatl se pehle sudhir ne jin ladakon kaa naam liya tha, unhone hi uske chaar doston ko maut ke ghat utaara he
 According to police sources, Sudhir was the last to talk to Bhupesh on mobile last night
 jab wo usase khud par ai musiibat kii baat bataa hi rahaa tha, is dauraan bhupesh ne kathith taur par goli kii awaz bhi suni thi or kuch hi der baad mobile phone band ho gaya tha
 But as the night passed, the story that reached these two villages of Delhi, shocked everyone

 susheel kumaar ke baad bihar kii rajdhani patna ke rahane vaale ek or shaks ne ek karod rupee jite hai jis apisod kaa prasaaran 9 november ko hoga
 When Sushil was playing KBC, he was in trouble of drinking water

 lekin yahaan kismat ne saath diya
 After the answer given by the expert, Sushil has no doubt that this answer can only reach him as a millionaire
 ab baari thi pani pine kii or pani pine kii or pani pine kii
 Because returning from here means no, there was no scope for Sushil to return and the thirteenth question came up

 himmat ke aage jeet he or yahi himmat susheel ne dikhaai jab wo kebisi ke manch par aae
 If he wanted, he could leave the game at many stages
 aakhir 6000 kamaanevaale susheel ke liye har rakam moti rakam hoti

 iraq jal rahaa he or lakhon us aag main jhulas rahe hai
 His heat is reaching far and wide
 duniya kaa koi bhi desh usase achoota nahin he kyonki isse tel kaa bazaar garam ho rahaa he
 Expensive oil prices have gone up and are impacting the economies across the world
 aakhir yah tel hi to he jo yah khun-kharaaba or narsanhaar karvaa rahaa he
 England continued to occupy oil wells from 1917 for the next decade using enormous military power there
 tees saal tak vahaan shashan karne ke baad angrejon ne use azaadi di
 After America's entry through Saddam, everything went well until 1972 and then the government there nationalized the oil wells
 yaheen se sari samasya shuru hui
 This severely hurt the interests of England and America because by then the Iraq Petroleum Company was taking British and American interests into consideration
 iske baad vahaan america ne apane pattey khilne shuru kar die or baghawat karvaa kar saddaam hossain kii bath party ko satta dilava di
 When Saddam Hussein later realized that he had become stronger, he made the mistake of attacking Kuwait, which resulted in the first Gulf War
 america ne iraq par na keval hamalaa karke kuwait ko aaazaad karaayaa balki uski moti keemat bhi vasuuli
 60% are Shia, but Sunni is not even less powerful
 Not only this, he also fully occupied Iraq in 2003 by making false accusations with England
 2011 main iraq ko azaadi to mili lekin tab tak saddaam hossain ke parivaar tak kaa safaya ho chukaa tha
 Saddam made Iraq a prosperous and strong country during his long reign
 lekin unhen faansee die jane ke baad vahaan aantarik satta kaa santulan gadabada gaya
 The Prime Minister is Nuri al-maliki Shia and he never tried to take the Sunni community into confidence
 shiya or sunni main bante iraq main shiyaon kii taadaad lagbhag 60 fisadi he lekin vahaan sunni gut kaaphi taqatvar rahe hai jinhone hameshaa vahaan shashan kiya tha
 Sunni fighters rebelled last year as well
 Last year Sunni fighters destroyed the cities of Western Iraq, Faluja and Ramadi
 faluja par to unka kabja hi ho gaya
 Now their fighters are marching to Baghdad, conquering the city of Mosul
 vahaan bheeshan ladaai ho rahi he or hajaaron log maare ja chuke hai
 The Iraqi government is pleading with the US to escape, saying that it should attack the attackers
 lekin baraak obama or jorge bush main yaheen par fark he
 Had Bush been there, he would have sent the US Army, but Obama does not want to take such a big risk
 ve jaanate hai ki baad main iske jatil nattejey ho sakate hai
 Bush became extremely unpopular by sending Iraq troops
 america ko uski bahut zyada aarthik keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 Is Iraq moving towards Partition? Many Americans believe that this is a natural case of balance of power in which two pieces of Iraq can also occur
 agar aisa hota bhi he to america ko kai fark nahin padataa or uskaa kaaran he ki iraq ke tel bhandaron main america companiyon kii dilchaspee ab khatm hoti ja rahi he
 With the use of new technology, his dependence on others is getting reduced and he has no shortage of oil due to increasing oil supply from Venezuela and Canada
 america ek vyapaaree desh he or uskaa har kadam napha-nuksaan ke anusaar hi uthta he
 This time too, he will take similar decisions
 matlab saaf he, irakiyon ko apni ladaai khud hi ladani hogi chaahe desh ke do tukade kyon na ho jaae

 According to intelligence sources, 35 kg RDX has so far been transported from different places along the Pakistan border to Rajasthan for the bomb blast in India

 ' There has been allegations of corruption in land acquisition for the mumbai-goa highway forelane

 An RTI activist and villagers have alleged that Narayan Rane's form house 'nilesh Farms' falls on the mumbai-goa Highway Fourlane, but his land and form house are not being acquired
 artiai kaaryakarta or gaanv waalon kaa aarope he ki purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke jameen adhigrahan karne main vilamb kiya ja rahaa he
 To save his form house, the mumbai-goa Highway Fourlane is being diverted
 graminon ne mumbai-goa haive forlan ko lekar shashan dwaara sautela vyavhaar karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he

 is haive main karnaala ke najadik ke tara or kharpara gaanvon kaa bhi samavesh he
 Many people's houses, form houses, hotels and industrial construction have been demolished by the government in the construction of this 85-km highway, but the form houses of Narayan Rane and his wife have not even been touched yet

 Here the question arises that when the houses of the villagers coming on the highway were demolished, then why was the part of Narayan Rane's form house not demolished? Why are they being obliged? Rane is also considered close to Union Minister of Road Transport and Shipping, Nitin Gadkari
 congress chhod chuke rane bijepi main shaamil hone kii taiyaari main bataae ja rahe hai
 At the same time, giving clarification in this matter, Rane said, 'I also own a land, but 70 percent people besides me have been compensated
 sarkaar ne mere liye hive kaa rasta nahin modaa he
 i did not even write a letter to the government in this regard
 mere parivaar ne is jameen ko 1985 main kharida tha
 i have not received a letter from the government in this regard nor do i know the RTI activist who got information about the case

 Were
 yograj se jab poocha gaya ki kya unke bete dwaara 21 gend khelnaa hi bharat ke srilanka se mirpur main haarane kaa mukhya kaaran tha to unhone kaha, 'yuvaraj ko hi akele jimmedaar nahin tehraana chahie
 Virat Kohli then struck a brilliant innings, scoring his fourth half-century in the tournament, but the Sri Lankan bowlers clamped down on the struggling Yuvraj, which significantly affected the scoring pace
 vah puri tarah se kharaab farm main dikh rahe the jisase duusari chor par farm main chal rahaa ballebaaj bhi hataash ho gaya
 Only 19 runs were scored in the last four overs as Yuvraj failed to land big hits
 yograj ne kaha ki jab ek team harati he to chaaron ore kaaphi aalochana hoti he
 He said, 'when we lose, there is criticism from all around
 utaar-chadhaav jindagi kaa hissaa hote hai or yah is match kaa bhi hissaa tha
 ' haal ke dinon main yuvaraj kharaab farm se guzar rahe hai, is par yograj ne kaha, 'jab ek khilaadi kharaab daur se gujarata he to dimagi haalat aisi ban jaati he ki vah yah sochna shuru kar detaa he ki agar vah ran nahin bana paata to vah team se baahar ho jayega yaa phir team haar jaaegi
 'yograj said that the sportsmanship of the player is more important for the game
 unhone kaha, 'jab westeindies 1983 vishwa cap main bharat se haar gaya tha to sar viv richards bhartiya dressing room main gaye the or unhone team ko badhai di thi or kaha tha ki unhone behatar cricket khelaa or ve jeet ke hakdaar the
 'he feels that Yuvraj should play more and more domestic cricket
 bijepi 2019 kii taiyaari 2004 ke shining india ke aadhaar par katai nahin hogi
 Because from 2022 onwards, if Modi remains in power till 2025, the centenary year of the Sangh, the Sangh will be able to expand across the country
 soch yahi he isliye 2019 main ye katai nahin kaha jayega ki beete 5 baras main modi ne kya kiya, balki 2022 kaa target kya-kya he ise hi janata ko bataaya jayega, jisase janata 2014 main maange gaye 60 maheene ko yaad naa karen
 Schemes to be completed in 2022 will be a dozen schemes including Clean India, Alternative Energy and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, so that people can give their own Modi government till 2022 thinking that all plans will be completed in 2022, and very closely The slogan of New India has also been kept till 2022
 jisamen target karpshan free india se lekar kaledhan se mukti ke saath-saath shanti, ekta or bhaichara kaa naaraa bhi diya gaya he
 modi-sangh's eyes are on the alert since 2019
 It is also necessary to win every election before 2019
 isliye sabase paini najar congress kii satta vaali karnataka par he
 BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao has been thinking from now that a manifesto should be prepared for every assembly seat in Karnataka
 baqayda har vidhansabha kshetra ke 500 se 1000 logon se baatcheet kar menifesto kii taiyaari shuru hui he
 People associated with every profession are being included in the people they will interact with
 vahiin duusari taraf sangh kaa shahar sanghathan modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke saath khadey rahe iske liye ab sangh ko jo mathne kaa kaam nagpur main hone vaali pratinidhi sabha ke saath hi shuru hoga
 There will be a reshuffle in the BJP along with a change in the RSS
 masalan ye mana ja rahaa he ki akhil vidhyaarthee parishad ko bijepi kaa nayaa bhartee manch banaaya jayega
 According to the betting on the Akhil Vidyarthi Parishad, there may be a reshuffle in the Vidyarthi Parishad for this
 vidhyaarthee parishad kii kaman sambhaal rahe sunil ambekar kii jagah bijepi ke rashtriya sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal ko vidhyaarthee parishad kii kaman di jaaegi yanibijepihi nahin sangh ke bheetar bhi ye sawaal he ki 2025 main modi kii umr bhi 75 kii ho jaaegi, to uske baad yuva netritv ko banane ke tareeke abhi se viksit karne honge

 He said that 30 months were given to build this road, but it is being completed in 14 months only

 These days, employees in most chartered accountants are busy working till late in the evening
 kaam kaa bahut dabaav dikhataa he
 However, the audited tax returns which have to be filed before 30 September
 iske alaava desh ke vittamantri arun jetali ko rojaanaa saikadon chitthiyaan likhi ja rahi hai ki kripaya samaysima thodi badha dijie
 After all, it is very important to know why the tax consultants are seeking to extend the deadline
 ab pehle samaj len ki yah masalaa kya he
 Normally, the jobber or any earner who does not have to get income audit, has to file income tax return by 31 July, while those who are required to be audited such as those earning or earning more than 25 lakhs per annum
 People and private companies, the last date for filing their returns (with audit), is 30 September
 yahi system varshon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Usually, on July 31, the returns of ordinary employed people are filed and then 60 days are received for filing the audited returns of the companies, but this year the matter has gone awry
 inakam tex vibhaag ne pehle may maheene main hi aam logon ke ritern file karne kaa formet apni website par aplod kar diya
 Many information was sought in this format, which was difficult to give
 swaabhaavik tha ki desh main isaki bahut aalochana hui
 Due to this criticism, the Income Tax Department withdrew it
 phir 50 dinon tak kuch nahin hua or aakhirkaar 29 july ko nayaa formet jari hua, taaki log uske mutabik inakam tex bhar saken
 Due to this apparent failure, the Income Tax Department extended the time to 31 August
 isi dauraan gujarat main patidaar andolan ke chalate hinsa ho gai, to taarikh 7 sitambar tak badha di gai
 Now finally the income tax returns of the people were filed on 7 September
 gujarat ke agrani chartered accountint rajani shah kehete hai ki aise main audit karne ke baad tex ritern bharne kaa jo samay pehle 60 din tha, vah is saal ghatakar mushkil se 23 din rah gaya
 In such a situation how to expect quality work
 isiliye samay badhaane kii maang kii ja rahi he, lekin vitt vibhaag kii 9 sitambar ko jari ek press relies main saaf kar diya gaya he ki samyavadhi nahin badhaai jaaegi
 The government has argued that the format has not been overhauled
 shah kehete hai ki agar maamuli pherbadal hi kiye gaye hai to vibhaag ko formet aplod karne main ek saal kaa samay kyon laga, kyonki pichley saal bajet to july main hi pesh ho gaya tha
 Many feel that this year the Income Tax Department is taking revenge on the tax consultant
 aakhir kis baat kaa badla, isaki kahani bhi dilachasp or haroonges he
 Normally whoever deducts TDS (pay tax after deducting tax) has to deposit that amount with the government every quarter and then private companies have to file a report in 15 days and government departments in 30 days
 isamen agar deree hui to aapako pratidin 200 rupee kii dar se jurmaana dena hoga
 Although this rule has been in place for years, fines were still not charged, but from the second quarter of 2012-13, notices of fines suddenly started reaching millions
 sabhi aashcharya main the
 The matter reached the court, but the litigants also started collecting information from all government departments under the RTI whether the government has received this notice along with private companies, or whether the government departments fill this report on time
 isamen jo tathy aae vah chaunkaane vaale the
 The Controller and Auditor General and even the Income Tax Department themselves do not file this report in time, but action is not taken against them
 is par kaaphi shor machaa
 The government did not tighten its departments, but gave them time till 31 March 2014 for this
 tippaniyan Rajni Shah says that this was probably the first time that the law was the same, but applied to private companies and government departments were exempted
 aisa bhedbhaav unhone pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 Many cases related to this are also under consideration in different courts of the country, but the question arises that when the Digital India campaign is going on, will the basic tax system in the country ever be smooth? aakhir tex canceltent samaysima badhaane kii maang kyon kar rahe hai, yah jaananaa behad jaruri he
 Now first understand what this issue is
 aamtaur par naukareepesha yaa kisi bhi kamai karne vaale, jise aamadani kaa audit nahin karwaanaa hota he, use 31 july tak inkam tex ritern bharna hota he, vahiin jinka audit jaruri hota he jaise ki 25 lakh se zyada salanaa vetan paane vaale yaa kamai karne vaale log or privet companiyaan, unke riterns (audit ke saath) bharne kii antim tithi 30 sitambar hoti he
 This system has been in operation for years
 aamtaur par 31 july ko saamaanya naukareepesha logon ke ritern file ho jate hai or phir companiyon ke audited ritern file karne ke liye 60 din milte hai, lekin is saal maamla gadabada gaya he
 In the first month of May, the Income Tax Department uploaded the format of filing returns of common people on its website
 is formet main kai sari jaankariyaan maangi gayi thi, jo dena mushkil ho rahaa tha
 It was natural that there was a lot of criticism in the country
 is aalochana ke chalate inakam tex vibhaag ne ise waapas le liya
 Then nothing happened for 50 days and finally on July 29, a new format was released so that people could pay income tax accordingly
 apni is spasht naakaami ke chalate inakam tex vibhaag ne samay badhaakar 31 agast kar diya
 At the same time, due to the Patidar agitation in Gujarat, violence took place, then the date was extended to 7 September
 ab aakhirkaar aamalogon ke inkam tex ritern 7 sitambar ko bhare gayi
 Rajni Shah, Gujarat's leading chartered accountant, says that the time it was 60 days ago to file tax returns after an audit, this year has been reduced to hardly 23 days
 aise main quality kaam kii umid kaise kii jaae
 That is why there is a demand for extension of time, but in a press release issued by the Finance Department on September 9, it has been made clear that the time period will not be extended
 sarkaar ne tark diya he ki formet main zyada pherbadal nahin kiya gaya he
 Shah says that if only minor changes have been made, then why did the department take a year to upload the format, because last year the budget was presented in July itself
 kai logon ko lagata he ki is saal inakam tex vibhaag tex canceltent se badla le rahaa he
 After all, the story of what changed, its story is also interesting and surprising
 aamtaur par jo bhi tids (tex katkar kisi ko vetan dena) katata he use har timahi par vah dhanrashi sarkaar ke paas jamaa karwaani hoti he or phir privet companiyon ko 15 din main or sarkari vibhaagon ko 30 din main report darj karwaani hoti he
 If it is delayed, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 200 per day
 vaise yah niyam varshon se he, phir bhi jurmaana nahin liya jaataa tha, lekin 2012-13 kii duusari timahi se achaanak lakhon logon ko jurmaane ke notice pahunchane lage
 Everybody was surprised
 maamla court pahunchaa, lekin mukadmaa karne waalon ne sabhi sarkari vibhaagon se bhi artiai ke tahat jaankariyaan jutani shuru kin ki kya yah notice privet companiyon ke saath sarkari ko bhi mila he, yaa kya sarkari mahakme yah report samay par bharte hai
 The facts that came into this were shocking
 controlar and auditor general or yahaan tak ki inakam tex vibhaag khud bhi samay se yah report file nahin karata, lekin unke khilaaf to karrwai nahin hoti
 There was a lot of noise on this
 sarkaar ne apane vibhaagon par lagaam to nahin kasi, balki unhen iske liye 31 march 2014 tak kaa samay de diya
 The comments rajani shah kehete hai ki shaayad yah pehali baar ho rahaa tha ki kanoon ek hi tha, lekin privet companiyon par lagu hua or sarkari vibhaagon ko chhot de di gai
 He has never seen such discrimination before
 isse jude kai maamle desh kii alag-alag adaalaton main bhi vichaaradhin hai, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki jab digital india kii muhim chal rahi he to kya desh main buniyadi tex vyavastha bhi kabhi sucharu ho paaegi? Now first understand what this issue is
 aamtaur par naukareepesha yaa kisi bhi kamai karne vaale, jise aamadani kaa audit nahin karwaanaa hota he, use 31 july tak inkam tex ritern bharna hota he, vahiin jinka audit jaruri hota he jaise ki 25 lakh se zyada salanaa vetan paane vaale yaa kamai karne vaale log or privet companiyaan, unke riterns (audit ke saath) bharne kii antim tithi 30 sitambar hoti he
 This system has been in operation for years
 aamtaur par 31 july ko saamaanya naukareepesha logon ke ritern file ho jate hai or phir companiyon ke audited ritern file karne ke liye 60 din milte hai, lekin is saal maamla gadabada gaya he
 In the first month of May, the Income Tax Department uploaded the format of filing returns of common people on its website
 is formet main kai sari jaankariyaan maangi gayi thi, jo dena mushkil ho rahaa tha
 It was natural that there was a lot of criticism in the country
 is aalochana ke chalate inakam tex vibhaag ne ise waapas le liya
 Then nothing happened for 50 days and finally on July 29, a new format was released so that people could pay income tax accordingly
 apni is spasht naakaami ke chalate inakam tex vibhaag ne samay badhaakar 31 agast kar diya
 At the same time, due to the Patidar agitation in Gujarat, violence took place, then the date was extended to 7 September
 ab aakhirkaar aamalogon ke inkam tex ritern 7 sitambar ko bhare gayi
 Rajni Shah, Gujarat's leading chartered accountant, says that the time it was 60 days ago to file tax returns after an audit, this year has been reduced to hardly 23 days
 aise main quality kaam kii umid kaise kii jaae
 That is why there is a demand for extension of time, but in a press release issued by the Finance Department on September 9, it has been made clear that the time period will not be extended
 sarkaar ne tark diya he ki formet main zyada pherbadal nahin kiya gaya he
 Shah says that if only minor changes have been made, then why did the department take a year to upload the format, because last year the budget was presented in July itself
 kai logon ko lagata he ki is saal inakam tex vibhaag tex canceltent se badla le rahaa he
 After all, the story of what changed, its story is also interesting and surprising
 aamtaur par jo bhi tids (tex katkar kisi ko vetan dena) katata he use har timahi par vah dhanrashi sarkaar ke paas jamaa karwaani hoti he or phir privet companiyon ko 15 din main or sarkari vibhaagon ko 30 din main report darj karwaani hoti he
 If it is delayed, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 200 per day
 vaise yah niyam varshon se he, phir bhi jurmaana nahin liya jaataa tha, lekin 2012-13 kii duusari timahi se achaanak lakhon logon ko jurmaane ke notice pahunchane lage
 Everybody was surprised
 maamla court pahunchaa, lekin mukadmaa karne waalon ne sabhi sarkari vibhaagon se bhi artiai ke tahat jaankariyaan jutani shuru kin ki kya yah notice privet companiyon ke saath sarkari ko bhi mila he, yaa kya sarkari mahakme yah report samay par bharte hai
 The facts that came into this were shocking
 controlar and auditor general or yahaan tak ki inakam tex vibhaag khud bhi samay se yah report file nahin karata, lekin unke khilaaf to karrwai nahin hoti
 There was a lot of noise on this
 sarkaar ne apane vibhaagon par lagaam to nahin kasi, balki unhen iske liye 31 march 2014 tak kaa samay de diya
 The comments rajani shah kehete hai ki shaayad yah pehali baar ho rahaa tha ki kanoon ek hi tha, lekin privet companiyon par lagu hua or sarkari vibhaagon ko chhot de di gai

Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer film 'padmavati' was scheduled to release on 1 December
 lekin badhate vivaad ke baad sanjay lila bhansaali kii is film par roak lag gai or isaki relies taal di thi
 According to the news published in India Today, now the Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer film is likely to get the censor's approval today
 khabaron kii maane to film kii relies ko lekar kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki ye film 5 yaa 12 janvari ko relies ho sakati he
 Hearing in the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Padmavati, Bhansali should be present! There has been a long uproar over the film that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has twisted Padmavati's personality in his film
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki mekars kii ore se 17 november ko sensor board ko copy saunpi gai he
 The documents sent by the producers of the film to the censor board, described many flaws
 padmavati vivaad: mantriyon kii bayaanbaji ko lekar SC kii centre sarkaar ko fatkarabta den ki padmavati par jari vivaad ke bich supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko jamkar khari-khoti sunai thi
 He was also the chief minister, minister and public representative on the target of the Supreme Court, who in recent times made irresponsible statements about Padmavati
 supreme court ne yah bhi hidaayat di ki sensor board kii clearence se pehle film ke khilaaf bayaanbaji band karen
 This is creating a bad environment
 18 saal se bhansaali bananaa chaahate the padmavathibahut kam logon ko is baat kii jaankaree he ki sanjay lila bhansaali ye film kareeb 18 saal pehle se bananaa chaahate the
 For this, he had also finalized the star cast, although that could not happen then
 kuch vajahon se ye film thande baste main chali gai
 In fact, Bhansali had the story of bajirao-mastani and 'padmavati' in mind since he made 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' in 1999 with Salman Khan, Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai
 film main salmaan-aish kii jodi lene ke peeche unki on or ofscreen chemistry thi
 Bhansali wanted to produce Bajirao Mastani and Padmavati with the pair
 sutron kii maane to bhansaali kii koshish thi ki ham dil de chuke sanam kii jaadu ko ek baar phir silver screen par ricriet kiya jaae
 However, this could not happen
 jaankaree ke mutabiq aishwarya raay ko rani padmavati kaa role karnaa tha jabaki salmaan khan ko allaudin khilji kaa role diya ja rahaa tha

 gajiabad main 11 farvari ko voting honi he yani kal yahaan prachaar kaa aakhri din hoga
 On this occasion, while Modi attacked the ruling Samajwadi Party, he also failed to pinch the Congress
 haalanki mayawati unke nishane se bachi raheen
 Five years account, Akhilesh Akhilesh ji, what did you do to your father, what did uncle do, what did the daughters-in-law and nephews know about the people here
 samay kii maang he ki aap upi kii janata ke bich jaakar pichley paanch saal kaa hisaab dijie
 In five years, you disappointed and kept UP devastated
 main unke bhaashan sunata hum, bas modi kii buraai karte hai
 Hey, why don't you account for what you did? sattadhari netaaon ke sangrakshan main krimaj upi main suraj dhalane ke baad koi bahan-beti akeli raste par nahin nikal sakati
 There are 40 thousand cases of Arms Act itself
 krime yahaan ek saamaajik buraai se zyada aapaki party ke netaaon ke aashray main chal rahaa gorakhdhandha he
 These were the policemen, but when Kalyan Singh got the opportunity of service, Rajnathji got the service of Asavar, then all the goons were either in jail or repaired
 yuvaaon ko naukari kaa vaadaupi main hamaari sarkaar banane ke baad naukariyon kii bhartee main jo ghotaale hue hai, unki jaanch kii jaaegi or jinka haq banataa he, unhen naukari par lagaaya jayega
 In the center, i closed the job interview, we told all the states that you should also apply, but the UP government did not listen to me, they kept the paper in the file because if the interviews are closed then there will be no game of defeat, There are many ways to prevent corruption, but the government is sitting silently
 bhrashtachar hataanaa he to sarkaar hataoap bataaie upi main bhrashtachar chaalu rahegaa or main dilli main hataata rahoonga to pradesh se bhrashtachar jayega kya? pradesh se karpshan hataanaa he to inako satta se hataanaa padegaa, karpshan ke khilaaf meri ladaai main mujhe upi kaa saath chahie
 Mayawati's favorite officer was here, mulayam-akhilesh used to give speeches against him but as soon as his government was formed, he also became his favorite but it is CBI, Modi is today he is languishing in jail
 aise jitne bhi beyimaan hai wo sab jail main jaaenge
 a special task force will be formed for land mafias
 builder karegaa thagi to jail main kategi jindagirajyapal ji ne chitthiyaan likhin, bharat sarkaar ne kaha lekin upi sarkaar ne jidie kaa sieji se audit nahin karavaaya
 There is some black in the lentils, there is a scam of the land
 upi main hamaari sarkaar banane ke turant baad jitani deveopment athurity hai sabakaa sieji se audit kaa kanoon paas karenge
 The common man wants to buy a small flat but the builder lobby loots it
 ye pidaa 3-4 dashak se thi
 It was the responsibility of the Center to make laws
 hamane wo kanoon bana diya
 Today, the builder has to give the house as promised or else his life will be cut in jail
 fasal beemaa yojana or gehun kii kharidfasal beemaa yojana main buaai na ho pai ho to bhi or fasal katane ke baad nasht ho gai ho to bhi sarkaar paisa detii he
 Rajasthan government has insured 53 percent, Maharashtra 50 and Madhya Pradesh government 50 percent farmers, but the UP government has reached only 14 percent farmers
 jaise hi hamaari sarkaar banegi duusare hi din chote kisaanon kaa karja maaf kar diya jayega
 The work of providing crop insurance scheme will be started in the entire state
 haryana kii sarkaar kisaanon se 60 fisadi genhun kharidti he, empi kii hamaari sarkaar 50 fisadi kharidti he lekin upi kii sarkaar sirf 3 fisadi kharidti he kyon?garibon kii suchi tak nahin bana paae akhileshbharat sarkaar garibon ko do vakt bhojane mili uske liye 25-30 rupee roj ke hisaab se detii he
 We asked the UP government for this but Akhilesh government could not give this list because it looks at caste while making the list
 usase milane vaale vot dekhati he
 We have 750 million rupees lying with us, but we want to give the government sleep
 chote vyapaaree daren nahinchote vyapaariyon ko iskar vibhaag se darane kii jarurat nahin
 My government has no agenda against them
 maine iskar vibhaag ke afasaron se kaha he mail karo, esemes se jaankaree maango khud nahin jaaoge taaki saudebaaji na ho
 We will catch big fish that suppress fat goods like we removed 150 crores from a minister's house in Karnataka
 akhilesh ne kiya niraash, upi kaa vinashmain mulaayam singh kaa aadar karne vaala vyakti rahaa hum
 For Ram Manohar Lohia, there has been an impact on the minds of the poor like us
 akhilesh ji jab chunakar aae to hamen lagata tha ki noujvaan he, kuch padhaa-likhaa he jarur upi main kuch acha karne kii koshish karegaa lekin paanch saal main aapane niraash karke rakh diya, upi kaa vinaash karke rakh diya
 Regarding Mayawati less, Chutkin on Congress, Narendra Modi said that Congress is a sinking boat but Akhilesh is so scared that he has set foot on the sinking boat
 takreeban puure bhaashan main modi ke nishane par upi sarkaar hi rahi
 He mentioned the former Mayawati government and Bahujan Samaj Party only once or twice
 congress ko unhone desh ko dubaane vaali party bataaya jo khud bhi dub gai he
 In the first rally after the assembly elections of five states, Narendra Modi lashed out at the Congress
 dehradun main unhone manmohan sarkaar par jabardast hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the people sitting in the center are disconnected from the public and left out of their minds
 unhone ramdev kaa bachaav kiya
 Said that the Congress is behind Yogguru
 agar uttarakhand aapadaa peediton kii seva ke peeche padati to tasviir alag hoti
 He said that if Ramdev asks people to breathe, then the Congress breath is going away
 rahul gandhi par saadhaa nishanabhartiya janata party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne ravivaar ko lokapal vidheyak kii pairvi karne ke liye congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii khilli udaate hue kaha ki agar bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye kanoon banane ko lekar unhen itani hi chintaa he to uttarakhand main bhuvanchandra khanduri ke kaarykaal main paarit lokayukta kanoon ko lagu kyon nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Addressing a huge public meeting at the historic parade ground here, Modi said without naming Rahul that a Netaji Congress leader held a press conference on the importance of passing his bill, describing Lokpal as an effective weapon against corruption
 modi ne kaha, ‘main unase sawaal poochna chahta hum ki agar congress ko bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye kanoon banane kii itani chintaa he to uttarakhand main bhaajapa kii purvavarti bhuwan chandra khanduri ke kaarykaal main paarit lokayukta kanoon ko lagu kyon nahin kiya ja rahaa
 The Lokayukta Act, passed unanimously by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly, was approved by President Pranab Mukherjee in September this year
 haalanki pradesh ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna is lokayukta kanoon ko usee rup main lagu karne ke paksh main nahin he
 In this regard, they say that there are many flaws in this law like the inclusion of the lower judiciary and it will be implemented only after amending them
 ramdev kaa kiya bachaavmodi ne congress sarkaron par yogaguru ramdev ke khilaaf apni puri takat jhonkne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha, ‘main hairaan hum ki dilli or dehradun kii sarkaron ne apni puri shakti ek baba ramdev ke khilaaf laga rakhi he
 Had they put half of its power to the disaster victims, their condition would have improved
 ’congress kii is raajnneetik soch ko apni samaj se pare bataate hue modi ne kaha ki congress kii aankh main ramdev chubh rahe hai
 He taunted and said, 'baba Ramdev is asking to breathe, while this is going to breathe the Congress
 ’ unhone aarope lagaaya ki koi din aisa nahin he jab in sarkaron dwaara baba ramdev ke khilaaf koi maamla darj na kiya ja rahaa ho
 He said that when the activities like the work done by Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev take place in a state, then it brings consciousness, creates employment and also benefits financially
 unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘lekin inkaa :congress kaa: iraadaa aisi gatividhiyon par taala lagane kaa rahata he taaki apni dukaan chalati rahe
 Accusing the Congress of adopting a discriminatory attitude towards non-congress states, he said that when you are in government, no one is alien, all are their own
 'vaajapeyi ji ne 10 saal ke liye aarthik package diya'is sambandh main purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha, ‘varsh 2003 main uttarakhand main congress kii sarkaar hote hue bhi vaajapeyi ji ne use 10 saal ke liye aarthik package diya jiske falswaroop rajya main hajaaron karodon rupee ke kaarkaane, rojgaar aaye or khushhaali aayi
 He said that as soon as the UPA government came to power, the package for Uttarakhand was reduced to seven years
 'mujhe aapadaa peediton ke saath dukh baantne kaa avasar nahin diya'apane sambodhan ke dauraan is saal aayi prakritik aapadaa main hue janmaal ke nuksaan kaa zikr karte hue modi ne uttarakhand kii congress sarkaar kii bhi is baat ke liye aalochana kii ki uski ‘raajnneetik nishthurataa’ ne unhen peediton ke saath dukh baantne kaa avasar nahin diya or unhen yahaan se vidaa kar diya
 Modi said that there was an earthquake in 2001 in Kutch and Bhuj of Gujarat and then he had accepted help from all the states extending their hands, even Pakistan
 modi ne kaha ki uttarakhand main sansadhano kii koi kami nahin he or yahaan jalavidyut pariyojnaon, jadi booti or paryaton khaastaur se dharmik paryaton kii apaar sambhaavna he jiske vikaas se yahaan ke naujavaanon ko rajya se baahar jane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 He said, 'there is a saying in Uttarakhand again and again that mountain youth and water do not work for it
 lekin agar jalavidyut shakti or paryaton ke vikaas par dhyaan diya jaye to naujavaanon ko ghar chhodkar baahar jane kii jarurat hi nahin rahegi
 In this regard, he said that the dream of 125 crore Indians is that he must visit Haridwar and Rishikesh once and this dream is also associated with the economic benefit of the region
 'bhaajapa par vishwaas karen'ek saath janm lene vaale teen rajyon chhattisgarh, jharkhand or uttarakhand ke bare main modi ne kaha ki chhattisgarh baaki donon rajyon ke mukaable samrudh rajyon kii barabari main teji se aage bad rahaa he
 Explaining the reason for this, he said that the people of Chhattisgarh acted sensibly and formed the BJP government, while in the other two states, frequent change of party and leader led to instability and it damaged development
 unhone kaha ki vah janata se apil karte hai ki ab zyada prayog na karen or bhaajapa par vishwaas karen
 In this regard, Modi said that he has found a lot here as the party in-charge of Uttarakhand
 unhone kaha, ‘ishwar shakti de or yadi aap aashirwad den to main kuch to aapako lautaa sakuun

 Those associated with the Air Force call it the ultimate 'jugaad' - a Russian-made air-to-air missile with an Israel-made helmet-mounted display, which Indian Air Force pilots fly a France-built Mirage-2000 fighter plane Wear it
 or yahi nahin, bhartiya vayusena (IAF) apane miraj-2000 ladaaku vimaanon ko udaate hue pichley lagbhag 10 saal se isi 'jugad' kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The air-to-air France-made R-530D and Magic II missiles fitted in the Mirage aircraft inducted into the Indian Air Force in 1985 were obsolete by 2008, and without them, the iaf's Mirage aircraft have no There is no missile
 behad kam vikalpon kii maujuudagi main or mixilon ko hasil karne kii lambi prakriya ke bare main sochate hue IAF ne maujuuda roosi R-73 mixilon ko hi miraj par integrat karne kaa faisla kiya
 R-73 missiles were already deployed on Sukhoi 30, mig-29 and mig-21 'bison' aircraft of the Indian Air Force, but were never tried to integrate them on platforms from a western country
 itnaa hi nahin, france sarkaar ne bhi is kadam kaa virodh kiya, kyonki ve francisi plateform par kisi roosi missile ko integrat kiye jane main madad nahin karnaa chaahate the, khaastaur se tab, jab unke paas nae dizine se taiyaar francisi misile bharat ko niryaat kiye jane ke liye uplabdh thim
 Well, the integration took place, and was heavily supported by engineers from the Israeli company Elbit, with whom the IAF had contracted by then to supply state-of-the-art DASH helmet-mounted displays
 helmet-mounted disple aisa upkaran he, jiske zariye mishan kii mahatvapurn jaankaree payalat kii ankhon ke saamne maujuud screen par dikhti rahati he
 The easier it was to think of attaching the R-73 missiles to the DASH helmet, the more difficult it was to actually do
 integration se judi dikkaton ke bare main jaankaar ek vayusenadhikari ne kaha, "kai ahm chunautiyaan thim
 
 
 "he explained," It was a new helmet, and we were working without source code
 
 
 " duusare shabdon main kahen, to aise elgoridam banaae jane the, taaki miraj ke radar or israeli helmet-mounted site apane aap hi roosi missile kii 'harkaton ko samaj' saken
 In the absence of the right algorithms and modified software, the integration of Russian missile would have been impossible
 vayusenadhikari ne bataaya, "na rus se madad lee gai, na france se
 
 
 Of course, they were angry
 
 
 " lekin vah 'jugad' kaam kar gaya
 According to the official, "the R-73 missile was far more capable than the Magic II missile it was launched against
" 
 
 "ek dashak se bhi zyaada vakt tak vayusena ne kabhi is baat kaa zikr nahin kiya tha ki usne miraj 2000 vimaanon ke saath R-73 mixilon ko kis tarah integrat kiya tha, lekin kargil yuddh ke dauraan tiger hill par kiye gaye vayusena ke hamale kii varshganth par 24 june ko unhone R-73 missile ke saath ek miraj 2000 vimaan ko shokes kiya
 This is not the first time Israeli engineers have helped the IAF with the Mirage 2000 aircraft
 kargil yuddh ke dauraan bhi israeli ejiniyaron ne litaning lesar designetter pod ko miraj vimaanon main sirf 12 din ke bheetar feet kar diya tha, jisaki madad se lesar-gided bamon ko sena ke yuddh itihaas main pehali baar istemaal kiya ja sakaa
 However, the Indian Air Force is now gradually replacing the Russian-made R-73 missiles with other missiles in their place
 varsh 2015 se bhartiya vayusena ke paas bahut modyphid miraj 2000 vimaan aa rahe hai, jinamein hawa se hawa main maar karne vaali francisi MICA misile feet hai
 One such squadron, or 18 aircraft, have already been inducted into the IAF
 is apgrade prakriya ke jaankaar ek vayusena payalat ne bataaya, "nazadiiki ladaai main R-73 ke mukaable MICA missile lagbhag chaar guna zyaada sakasham he, or yah (israeli) DASH helmet-mounted site ke saath integrated bhi he
 
 
 "the Russian-made R-73 is the same missile used by Wing Commander Abhinandan Vardhaman to shoot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter aircraft by flying a mig-21 'bison' fighter aircraft on the Line of Control on 27 February
 isse ek din pehle hi bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan kii seemaa ke kaaphi bheetar ghuskar balakot main aatankwaadi gut jaish-e-mohammad ke prashikshan centre ko dhwast kiya tha
 All aircraft that dropped glide bombs to the target in the Balakot mission were Mirage 2000s, and all had R-73 missiles deployed to deal with Pakistani Air Force combat aircraft

 Deepika Padukone appeared for women, so now Kamaal Rashid Khan has come to the arena to advocate for men
 vaise to'maay chwwis' video kaa mail varjanabhi log dekh chuke hai jisamen ladakon kaa paksh rakhaa gaya he
 But the way KRK has responded to Deepika's video, it seems the entire possibility of a new contravention is starting
 bolte bolte keaarke itnaa bol gaye ki deepika ke puraane afares se lekar bhavishya main hone vaale afares tak ko torget kar diya
 By the way, he did not spare Homi Adajania, who made the video
 unpar nishaanaa saadhane ke liye unki patni ke kandhon par bandook rakh diya
 Interestingly, Homi's wife Anahita Shroff is also seen in that video
 isliye keaarke ne anahita ke bare main jo bolaa uske baad ashanka he ki keaarke kaa bandook baikaphire naa kar de
 Kamal Khan has also regretted the understanding of the writer who wrote the script of the video 'may Choice'
 video main keaarke ne kaha he kimaay chwwis video main mahila shashaktikaran kii paribhaashako sex, lav or clubing tak simit kar diya gaya he
 While this issue is much bigger than this
 keaarke se pehle sonakshi sinha or kangana ranot samet kai logon ne 'maay chwwis' video kii aalochana kii he
 Watch krk's review on 'my Choice' video- bharat main sarkari naukari paanaa aasaan kaam nahin he

 The film is based on the life of mountain breaker Dashrath Manjhi
 is film ke dialog se ye sikh le sakate hai students:1
 There is a lot of swagger in the Torah, see how it is uprooted
 Your dialogue should be the favorite of every student preparing for civil service
 kaaphi mehnat ke baad jab aap us str par pahunch jaaenge, jahaan aap aasaani se sawaal hal karne lagenge, vahaan aap is dialog kaa istemaal karne lagenge

 jab tak todenge nahin, tab tak chodenge nahin, bahutai bada dangal chalegaa re tohar hamaar:is pariksha main safalataa hasil karne ke liye students ko kai saal lag jate hai
 So this dialog will always increase your spirits

 People say that we are crazy
 Life is spoiling: There will be many occasions in the years of preparation for the exam, when people will advise you to leave the preparation and do another job
 is sthiti main vahi sunen jo aapkaa dil kahata ho
 It is in your hands to spoil or make a good life

 It is more difficult than breaking a mountain: Let it be difficult or easy to get a newspaper out, so those who take the newspaper will continue to decide
 aap sochie ki civil sarvice paas karnaa pahaad todane se zyada kathin he yaa nahin

 bhagwaan ke bharose mat baithiye, kaa pataa bhagwaan hamare bharose baitha ho:is dialog ko aap ek salaah kii tarah le sakate hai
 Most students start cursing God for their failure or start saying that all God is trustworthy
 bhagwaan chahega to naukari lag hi jaaegi
 Get out of these arguments and think whether you know this job awaits you

 The Home Ministry is also believed to have demanded action against the Kolkata Police Commissioner for alleged discipline and violation of All India Services rules

 Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, the Prime Minister talked about working above the politics of 'tu-tu, main-main'
 magar iskaa asar buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main dekhne ko nahin mila
 The two-day-old case of Congress MP Kumari Selja being asked about her caste when she visited a temple in Gujarat was raised by the BJP, then what was made of the speech of the Saurashtra Prime Minister was over in a minute
 darasal rajyasabha main sadan ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki congress kii ek mahila saansad ne gujarat ke jis mandir ke bare main jati puche jane kii shikaayat kii thi ki aazaadee ke itane saalon baad bhi bharat main aisa hota he, usee mandir ke visitor book main unhone mandir kii khub prashansa kii he
 In response, Kumari Selja said in a clarification that he did not mention the main temple of Dwarka, he meant the Bet Dwarka temple
 bet dwarika yaa shankhodar mandir mukhya dwarika mandir se alag he
 The Bet Dwarka temple is on an island, which takes an hour to reach from Dwarka and can be reached only by boat or steamer
 itani si baat ko lekar vipaksh or sarkaar main than gai
 Due to an old case, the proceedings of Rajya Sabha had to be stopped again and again
 vipaksh netaa sadan se maafee maangane ko kah rahaa tha, to sarkari paksh kumari shailaja se
 The comments kisi tarah donon pakshon main sulah hui, magar tab manhagaai par bahes ko taalkar chennai main baadh par bahes shuru kii ja saki, wo bhi isliye ki isse maanviya pahalu juda hua he
 The question arises as to why the issue of Shailaja was raised by the government
 kya yah kisi ranneeti ke tahat tha, kyonki yadi yah maamla nahin bhi uthta to kisi ko koi fark nahin padataa
 The debate was over
 pradhanmantri kaa jabaab bhi aa chukaa tha
 Was this case due to the sharp attacks on Rahul Gandhi's government in the Lok Sabha
 kya yah isliye bhi hua ki congress ne loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi kaam roko prastaav kii maang shuru kar ve
 K
 singh ke istife kii maang shuru karte hue wel main pahunch gaye the
 As soon as the Congress walked out of the Lok Sabha, the matter of Kumari Selja was raised in the Rajya Sabha on behalf of the BJP and the process of taking everyone along was destroyed
 yadi sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main bhi isi tarah se shah or maat kaa khel chalata rahaa to sarkaar ke mahatvarpun bilon kaa kya hoga kahana thodi jaldbaaji hogi
 In fact, the Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley said that a woman MP of Congress had complained about the temple of Gujarat about which caste is asked in India even after so many years of independence, in the visitor's book of the same temple He has praised the temple very much
 jabaab main kumari shailaja ne safai main kaha ki unhone dwarika ke mukhya mandir kaa zikr nahin kiya tha, unka matlab bet dwarika mandir se tha
 The Bet Dwarka or Shankhodar temple is different from the main Dwarka temple
 bet dwarika mandir ek tapu par he, jahaan dwarika se jane main ek ghanta lagata he or vahaan naav yaa steamer se hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The opposition and the government got very worried about this much
 ek puraane maamle kii vajah se rajyasabha kii kaarywahi baar-baar rokani paddy
 The Leader of Opposition was asking the House to apologize, then the government side Kumari Selja
 tippaniyan Somehow there was a reconciliation between the two sides, but then the debate on the flood in Chennai could be started by avoiding the debate on inflation, that is also because it has a human aspect attached to it
 sawaal yahi uthta he ki sarkaar kii taraf se shailaja kaa mudda kyon uthaaya gaya
 Was it under any strategy, because even if this does not arise, no one would mind
 bahes to khatm ho chuki thi
 The Prime Minister's reply had also arrived
 kya yah maamla rahul gandhi ke loksabhaa main kiye gaye sarkaar par tikhe hamalon kii vajah se hua
 Was it also because the Congress started demanding the stop work proposal as soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started? ke
 They had reached Vail, starting demanding Singh's resignation
 congress ke loksabhaa se walk out karte hi bijepi kii taraf se rajyasabha main kumari shailaja kaa maamla uthaa or sabko saath lekar chalane kaa taana-bana tahas-nahas ho gaya
 If the game of check and check continues in the winter session of Parliament in the same way, then it will be a little hasty to say what will happen to the important bills of the government
 bet dwarika yaa shankhodar mandir mukhya dwarika mandir se alag he
 The Bet Dwarka temple is on an island, which takes an hour to reach from Dwarka and can be reached only by boat or steamer
 itani si baat ko lekar vipaksh or sarkaar main than gai

 Was this case due to the sharp attacks on Rahul Gandhi's government in the Lok Sabha
 kya yah isliye bhi hua ki congress ne loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi kaam roko prastaav kii maang shuru kar ve
 K
 singh ke istife kii maang shuru karte hue wel main pahunch gaye the
 As soon as the Congress walked out of the Lok Sabha, the matter of Kumari Selja was raised in the Rajya Sabha on behalf of the BJP and the process of taking everyone along was destroyed
 yadi sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main bhi isi tarah se shah or maat kaa khel chalata rahaa to sarkaar ke mahatvarpun bilon kaa kya hoga kahana thodi jaldbaaji hogi
 Somehow there was a reconciliation between the two sides, but then the debate on the flood in Chennai could be started by avoiding the debate on inflation, that is also because it has a human aspect attached to it
 sawaal yahi uthta he ki sarkaar kii taraf se shailaja kaa mudda kyon uthaaya gaya
 Was it under any strategy, because even if this does not arise, no one would mind
 bahes to khatm ho chuki thi
 The Prime Minister's reply had also arrived
 kya yah maamla rahul gandhi ke loksabhaa main kiye gaye sarkaar par tikhe hamalon kii vajah se hua
 Was it also because the Congress started demanding the stop work proposal as soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started? ke
 They had reached Vail, starting demanding Singh's resignation
 congress ke loksabhaa se walk out karte hi bijepi kii taraf se rajyasabha main kumari shailaja kaa maamla uthaa or sabko saath lekar chalane kaa taana-bana tahas-nahas ho gaya
 If the game of check and check continues in the winter session of Parliament in the same way, then it will be a little hasty to say what will happen to the important bills of the government
 kya yah isliye bhi hua ki congress ne loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi kaam roko prastaav kii maang shuru kar ve

 It is noteworthy that Yogi Adityanath is going to take oath as CM of UP today
 unke saath keshav prasad maury or dinesh sharma dipti siem pad kii shapath lenge
 The swearing-in ceremony to be held at 2:15 pm will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, national president Amit Shah, and many prominent BJP leaders and chief ministers of bjp-ruled states

 The Parliamentary Committee on Security Affairs, while mentioning several flaws in the government's Counter Terror Policy, said that the government is neither able to stop the terrorist attack nor has it learned any lesson from the attack in Pathankot
 suraksha maamalon kii sansadeey samiti ne buudhvaar ko apni ek report rajyasabha main pesh kii, jisamen usne ullekh kiya ki kendriya grih mantralay kaise kaam kar rahaa he
 The committee has also raised many questions on the working of the ministry
 samiti ne kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki sarkaar tamaam koshishon ke baavjood aatankwaadi hamalon ko roak paane main naakaamayaab rahi he
 In Jammu and Kashmir alone, one after the other attacks occurred in Pampore, Baramulla, Handwara and Nagrota
 sansadeey samiti ne apni report main likhaa he ki jald se jald wo sabhi lupahole bharne kii zarurat hai jo hamaare suraksha ghere main he, saath hi intelligence ikattha karne kii takanic bhi badalane kii zarurat he
 This Parliamentary Committee on Security matters is headed by former Home Minister p Chidambaram
 chidambaram ke mutabiq unhen ye baat gale se nahin utar rahi kii teror alert ke baavjood aatanki pathankot airbase main kaise ghus gaye or hamalaa karne main kamyaabi rahe
 The committee also took cognizance that the terrorists also abducted the Punjab Police SP
 samiti kaa maananaa he hamaare suraksha greed main kai khamiyaan he
 How the terrorists managed to enter India despite flood lights on the outskirts and the Border Security Force's watch
 samiti ne yah bhi kaha he ki ye bhi samaj main nahin aa rahaa kii aatankiyon ne espi or uske dost ko agava karne ke baad kaise or kyon chhod diya
 The NIA should properly investigate this matter
 tippaniyan Regarding the work of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Security Committee also emphasized that the investigating agencies should also investigate the narco syndicate, which is active in the border areas, especially in Punjab
 samiti ne is baat par apni naaraazgi jataai ki ek saal hone ke baad bhi abhi tak enie apni jaanch puri nahin kar pai he
 This committee related to security matters has now asked the government for the answer that when Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team came, it was clear that the NIA team from India will also go to Pakistan for investigation

 suraksha maamalon kii is sansadeey samiti kii aguwai purv grih mantri pi chidambaram kar rahe hai
 According to Chidambaram, he is not getting the grief about how the terrorists entered Pathankot airbase despite the terror alert and were successful in attacking
 samiti ne is baat kaa bhi sangyaan liya ki aatankiyon ne punjab police ke espi ko agava bhi kar liya
 The committee believes that our security grid has many flaws
 sarhad par flud lits lage hone or border sicurity force ke pehre ke baavjood aatanki bharat main kaise daakhil hone main kaamyaab ho gaye
 The committee has also said that it is not understood how and why the terrorists left the SP and his friend after being abducted
 is baat kii enie ko thik tarah se jaanch kerani chahie
 The comments grih mantralay ke kaamkaam ko lekar is suraksha samiti ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki jaanch agenciyon ko narco sindicket, jo sarahadi ilaakon main khaskar punjab main sakriy he, uski bhi jaanch kerani chahie
 The committee expressed its displeasure over the fact that even after a year, the NIA has not yet completed its investigation
 suraksha maamalon se judi is samiti ne sarkaar se is baat par ab jawaab maanga he ki jab pakistan kii joint investigeshan team ai thi, tab kya ye saafe kiya gaya tha kii bharat se bhi enie kii team jaanch ke liye pakistan jaaegi

 Ursula Burns is the first african-american woman chairman and CEO of a Fortune 500 company and is proud of this identity
 unka tark ekadam sidhaa-sada he: unhen garv se surkhiyon main rahakar dusron ko prerit karnaa he, jirox korporation ke liye phayda lenaa he, jisaki ve mukhiya hai
 This company, which has become synonymous with photo copy, was in a bad state, but this woman CEO has brought her back on track
 haal hi main ve india today group kii patrika bijness today ke most powerful viman award ke silsile main bharat ai thim
 On the occasion, he spoke to Business Today editor Chaitanya Kalabagh and managing editor Joji Puliantulutal to become a product and services company of Xerox and further his personal journey
 kuch ansh:12-13 saal pehle jirox company maut ke kagaar par thi
 You took command in 2009 and made a huge acquisition
 kya aapako lagata he ki aaj company kii jo sthiti he usase yah agle 50 saal tak badhati rahegi?beshak, agar aisa nahin hua to main apni nitiyaan badal duungi
 One of my responsibilities is to use the assets that the company has so much for the best in the interests of its clients and its shareholders and employees
 mere siio banane se pehle hamaari siio ain malkehi thim, jinhone company ko mushkil daur se nikaala
 By doing this, they made my way easier and entrusted me with the reins of a company that had no financial difficulty, had flexibility, had a strong foundation and had a strategy that was already working
 siio banane par meraa kaam isaki raftaar badhaane ke upaay talash karnaa tha
 We did not take any short cut, we worked hard, we were confident
 
 
 hamaari ejineering kii aisi blue collar company he jisaki buniyaad itani thos he ki ham baari chunautiyon kaa saamana kar saken or bahut sara kaam sambhaal saken
 We started under the leadership of former CEO Ann and started the business of document outsourcing
 uskaa phayda yah hua ki mujhe or us samay ain ke maargdarshan main kaam kar rahi team ko aisi duusari baton ke bare main sochane kaa mauka mil gaya jo ham kar sakate the kyonki yah kaarobaar to chal padaa tha
 We had to think about other business, we looked around and acquired some companies at that time, legal outsourcing, e-discovery outsourcing, mortgage processing outsourcing
 
 
 hamaara makasad in choti companiyon ko kharidte janaa or apana aakaar badhanaa tha
 But when i looked at it, it seemed that it would keep going, it would take a lot of time to buy these small ten million dollar companies and there is a lot of risk in that
 hamane dekha or sochaa or sochate rahe or phir ham is company se takaraae jiskaa naam tha asies
 ACS had already become very large and had run a variety of bpo-like businesses
 hamane vah company kharid lee or vah isliye jaruri tha kyonki uske baad se ham bahut sari companiyaan kharidte gaye or unhen asies se jodate gaye
 ACS has a history of buying small companies and merging them into a larger company and expanding its scope by giving stability to a smaller company
 aap shuru se jirox main kaam karti rahi hai
 Do you think that this has made a huge difference in terms of leadership and the confidence to take the company forward in times of change and challenge? Or could it have the opposite effect because you are too much bound by the old rules and old-fashioned methods? As far as Xerox and at least the last two ceos are concerned, it was very important for the company to find a leader whom the company Have deep knowledge of the history and who has lived parts of it himself
 isliye aisa hua
 We started with this word — blue collar — and i use it deliberately in Xerox
 blue collar companiyaan yaa kaamgaar log adhiktar arthvyavasthaaon ke dil or aatma hai
 There are people who work hard, people are not afraid of challenges, people work together, people are ready to work beyond their responsibilities
 ab ham jo badlaav kar rahe hai, matlab sirf product vaale bijness se product and sarvice vaale bijness kii taraf bad rahe hai, usamen 'and’ bahut ahm he
 If i do not have full knowledge of what we have done in the past, i will end everything and make big changes and will also make a lot of mistakes in terms of what to keep and how to expand our scope and what to keep
 Need to know how to save it
 aap us sab kii taraf se ankhen pher sakate hai par mujhe us sab kii yaad dilaane vaali bahut sari baaten hai isliye main jitna behatar dhang se ho sake, kaam karte rahanaa chaahati hum or un chizon se bahut der tak nahin chipke rahanaa chaahati jinka mol nahin he
 Out of 30 big positions in your management, 11 are women
 kya aapako lagata he ki isse jirox ke halaat badale hai?company kii pahchaan asal main isse judi alag-alag pahachaanon yaa vyaktitvon ke milane se banati he
 i am 100% sure that our company's identity and our inclination has had an impact that we have had two female ceos in a row
 isamen koi shaq nahin he
 Interestingly, our way of recruiting people has probably not changed much
 hamen do kaamyaab siio isliye milin ki pehle kisi ne unhen bhartee kiya tha isliye company kii pahchaan gender se judi nahin he balki aisi company kii he jo mahilaon ko apni yogyata dikhaane main bahut aasaani se samarth karti he
 You say that women live in confusion
 yah kya he ?main aisi bahut sari mahilaon ko jaanati hum jo vastav main iskaa anubhav karti hai or mujhe aaj bhi kabhi-kabhi khud iskaa ehsaas hota he
 When i started, when i was an engineer, when i was studying engineering, when i became an engineer, when i became an engineering manager, when i became a business manager
 
 
 har baar akasar main sabase alag hoti thi, isliye nahin ki main kuch khaas smart thi balki isliye ki main mahila thi
 i was black
 meri yahi khaas baat thi
 Being young was also a big deal
 un sab baton par meraa koi niyantran nahin tha, he na?lekin hamane aatmamanthan bahut kiya he
 Men do not care about it
 ve bistar se uthte hai or kaam par chale jate hai
 Everything as usual and very satisfied with where they are
 jaruri nahin he ki mahilaayein usee tarah apane aap santusht ho jaaen
 They have to carry themselves to where they are, forcing them to introspect
 ve kuch bhi karne se pehle bahut sochati hai, ve sochane se pehle bhi thaharti hai
 They are a little more observant
 asal main ham mahilaayein apni kshamtaaon ke bare mardon ke mukaable kahin zyada asamanjas main rahati hai, apni bahut aalochana karti hai or behad saavdhaan rahati hai
 Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has written the book Lean In
 main aage yaa peeche jhukne vaali vyakti nahin hum
 In fact, they are trying to say that we women step back a lot, it is not because we are less smart or are not training properly, or are not able to put our point in the right way
 hamaari aawaaj hameshaa alag hoti he isliye ham hameshaa uljhan main rahete hai ki kya ham vaaki sahi hai?mard jo hamaare bare main kehete hai ki kya vah yahaan tak isliye ai ki vah mahila he, kya vah yahaan isliye he ki vah ashwet he, matlab jo baaten mard hamaare bare main karte hai, vahi sawaal ham khud se bhi karne lagate hai
 i myself sometimes do this which is interesting because i have become the CEO of the company
 ham mahilaayein apni kshamtaaon ke bare main mardon ke mukaable zyada asamanjas main rahati hai

 on Tuesday
 isro vaigyanikon ne subah 8
 30 to 9
 30 baje ke bich chandrayan-2 ko chand kii kaksha LBN # 1 main pravesh karaayaa
 Now Chandrayaan-2 will rotate in an elliptical orbit with 118 km of apogee (less than the moon) and 18078 km of perigee (more than the moon) for the next 24 hours
 is dauraan chandrayan kii gati ko 10
 Reduced from 98 km per second to about 1
 98 kimi prati second kiya gaya
 The speed of Chandrayaan-2 has been reduced by 90 percent so that it does not fall under the influence of the moon's gravitational force
 20 agast yani mangalvaar ko chand kii kaksha main chandrayan-2 kaa pravesh karana isro vaigyanikon ke liye behad chunauteepurn tha
 But, our scientists accomplished it with great efficiency and accuracy
 7 sitambar ko chandrayan-2 chand ke dakshini dhruv par land karegaa
 Chandrayaan-2 was launched from rocket Bahubali from Sriharikota Launch Center on 22 July
 isse pehle 14 agast ko chandrayan-2 ko trans lunar orbit main daalaa gaya tha
 It is expected that on September 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will see Chandrayaan-2's landing on the moon's south pole live

 K
 sivan ne bataaya ki chandrayan-2 chand kii kaksha main jate samay kadi pariksha se gujaregaa
 The gravitational force of the moon lasts for 65000 km
 aise main chandrayan-2 kii gati ko kam karnaa padegaa
 Otherwise, under the influence of the moon's gravitational force, it can also hit it
 gati kam karne ke liye chandrayan-2 ke onboard propalshan system ko thodi der ke liye chaalu kiya jayega
 During this time, even a small lapse can make the vehicle uncontrolled
 yah sirf chandrayan-2 ke liye hi nahin balki vaigyanikon ke liye bhi pariksha kii ghadi hogi
 Chandrayaan-2, which does not collide with the moon, will therefore be accelerated, the impact of the strength of the moon is 65,000 km
 yani chand se is duuri tak aane vaale kisi bhi vastu ko chand apni ore khinch saktaa he
 On Tuesday, 20 August, Chandrayaan-2 will be 65,000 km from the moon, about 150 km away, then ISRO will start reducing the speed of Chandrayaan-2
 isse vah chand kii gurutvkarshan shakti ke se sangharsh karte hue chand kii kaksha main pravesh karegaa
 It may be that the orbiter will work for 2 years using the Chandrayaan-2 lander 'vikram' and the rover 'pragyan' on the lunar surface
 lekin, orbitor salbhar chand kaa chakkar lagaate hue research karegaa
 According to ISRO scientists, after making all the changes in the moon's orbit, the orbiter will have so much fuel that it can work for two years
 lekin yah sab 7 sitambar ke baad tay hoga

 When the Anti Corruption Bureau raided, the officers got teary eyes

 This compounder of Sawai Man Singh Hospital was appointed as consultant by the Health Ministry of the country and was a member of the Nursing Council of India
 aarope he ki isi kii aad main nursing college se ugaahi karata tha
 Within two months of being made advisor to the Ministry of Health, he sent notices regarding the recognition of 55 nursing colleges
 lekin ek nursing college ke trustee se 5 lakh kii rishwat lete anti karpshan beuro ne use range haath giraftaar kar liya
 The second grade compounder of Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur has done such an art that jugglers who are looking at the balance sheets of good companies are peeping
 anti karpshan beuro ko pataa chalaa ki sooyee lagane vaale sarkaar ne aisi dawaai nikaali ki 200 karod se zyada kii sampatti kaa swami ban baitha
 You must be wondering where you were when this story of becoming a Kuber was written overnight
 lekin mahesh koi yun hi nahin ho jaataa
 The dipping was first made a member of the Rajasthan Nursing Council, then the Indian Nursing Council, and two months earlier, the Health Ministry of India made him the advisor of the country's nursing affairs for the services of the Compounder Sahab in the field of health and the lion's seal Maheshchandra Sharma did not get the letter that became the forest king of the collection forest
 anti karpshan beuro ne ek nursing college ke trustee se mahesh ko 5 lakh rupee rishwat lete hue dabocha to uskaa sara khel khul gaya
 In order to increase the seats of nursing colleges, the compounder is accused of recovery to get recognition

 The tournament has been a part of controversies since its inception in 2008
 vittiya aniyamittaaon ke aarope lagane ke baad pichley saal ipel ke karishmai ayukta lalit modi ko barkhaast kar diya gaya, jabaki do frenchiji kings ilevan punjab or rajasthan rails lig main bane rahane ke liye bisisiai ke saath adaalat main sangharsh kar rahi hai
 Both these teams were dismissed by the board for allegedly violating rules in the ownership pattern
 suraksha kaarnon se britain main rah rahe modi par frenchygiyon kaa adhikaar dete samay doston or rishtedaaron ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope laga
 Apart from this, he was also accused of taking bribe in various IPL related agreements, which he rejected outright
 bhartiya janata party ne mangalvaar ko congress par aarope lagaaya ki vah 'sampradayik raajnneeti' kar rahi he or bhadakaau bhaashan dene vaale majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin ke netaa akbaruddin ovaisi kii giraftaar main deree kar unhen hero banane kii koshish kii
 BJP leader Prakash Javadekar told media persons here that Owaisi should have been arrested immediately after reaching home from London
 jaavdekar ne kaha, 'congress unhen sangrakshan de rahi he
 His intention is flawed 'unhone daawa kiya ki andhra pradesh main sattarudh congress hyderabad nagar nigam chunaav main emm kaa samarthan chaahati he, or isliye uski keemat chukaa rahi he
 He said that as per the procedure, if an accused complains of poor health, he is first produced in court and then taken to the hospital
 jaavdekar ne sawaal kiya, 'aisa kyon nahin kiya gaya?
 Owaisi was sent a notice by the police in connection with the provocative speech and asked to appear for questioning
 lekin somvaar ko landan se lautne ke baad unhone kharaab swasthya kaa hawala dekar peshi ke liye chaar din kaa atirikt samay maanga tha, jiske baad police unhen swasthya pareekshan ke liye aspataal le gai
 Owaisi was eventually arrested on Tuesday evening
 vahiin, bhaajapa netaa balbir punj ne kaha tha ki congress or emm kii mileebhagat ke kaaran ovaisi kii giraftaar main deree ho rahi he
 There is a 'match fix' situation between the two parties
 punj ne yahaan kaha, 'congress or emm ke bich mileebhagat he
 Akbar Owaisi must have had the support of local or central leaders when he gave a provocative speech
 'punj ne kaha, 'police kaa unke ghar janaa, unka chaar din kaa samay maangana naatak kaa hissaa he
 His ill is an excuse
 yah match fiks kaa hissaa he
 The government is not really serious about this matter
 'ullekhneey he ki bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke kaaran hyderabad sahit andhra pradesh ke teen jilon main ovaisi ke khilaaf maamle darj hai
 He has also been accused of waging war against the country
 karan johar ke production 'dharma production' ne apni nai film 'gunjan saxena- da kargil girl' (gunjan Saxena The Kargil Girl) kaa poster jari kar diya he
 The film is based on the iaf's female pilot Gunjan Saxena
 film main gunjan kaa kirdaar janhavi kapur nibhaa rahi hai, jabaki unke pita kii bhoomika main pankaj treepathi hai
 Now the question arises who is Gunjan Saxena (who is Gunjan Saxena) and what is the reason for making a film on him? Gunjan Saxena has been a flight lieutenant in the Indian Air Force
 44 saal kii gunjan ab ritair ho chuki hai
 She is known as Kargil Girl
 gunjan ko unki veerta, saahas or deshprem ke liye shaury puraskaar se nawaja ja chukaa he
 Gunjan is the woman who proved that on the injury of Dunke that women can not only become pilots but can get their iron in the battlefield
 kargil yuddh ke dauraan gunjan saxena ne yuddh kshetra main nidar hokar chita helicopter udaaya
 During this time, she was lifted from the high hills of Dras and Batalik and brought back to a safe place
 pakistani sainik lagaataar rocket launture or goliyon se hamalaa kar rahe the
 The missile was also fired on Gunjan's aircraft but the target missed and Gunjan narrowly survived
 bina kisi hathiyaar ke gunjan ne pakistani sainikon kaa muqabla kiya or kai javaanon ko vahaan se surakshit nikaala
 Explain that when Gunjan was graduating from Hansraj College, he joined Safdarganj Flying Club of Delhi
 us samay unke pita or bhai donon hi bhartiya sena main karyrat the
 During this time, he came to know that for the first time women pilots are being recruited in the IAF
 phir unhone SSB pariksha paas kii or bharyiya vayusena main bataur payalat shaamil ho gayi
 At that time, the security forces were dominated by male officers and women officers in the Indian Air Force were not given the opportunity to fly equal to men
 beshak us samay mahila adhikariyon ko ladaaku jet udaane kii anumati nahin thi, lekin unke batch kii mahilaon ne bhartiya vayusena main pehali baar vimaan udaakar itihaas to rach hi diya tha
 However at that time there was reservation for women pilots in the Indian Air Force
 lekin tab yah saaf nahin tha ki ve udaan bharne ke liye maansik or shaareerik tanaav or yudhon kaa saamana kaise karengi? in yuvatiyon ko apni kshamta sabit karne ke liye ek mauka chahie tha jo unhen 1999 main kargil yuddh ke dauraan mila
 During the war, when the Indian Army needed a pilot, Gunjan and Sri Vidya were sent to the war zone
 unhone apane mishan ko puraa karne ke liye kai baar line of control ke bilkul najadik se bhi udaan bhari jisase pakistani sainikon kii pojishan kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 Indeed, Gunjan not only proved that he is the true soldier of the country, but he also showed the world what women can do
 ab bhartiya vayusena main mahila payalat bhi fiter plane uda sakati hai or iskaa shrey kahin na kahin gunjan saxena jaisi himmati IAF payalton ko jaataa he
