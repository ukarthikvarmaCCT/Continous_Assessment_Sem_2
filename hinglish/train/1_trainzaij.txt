 ab in halaat main aap olympic main padak kii ummid kaise kar sakate hai? The Ghazipur landfill site accident has also drawn attention to the rest of Delhi's landfill sites
 gajipur ke baad ab north dilli kii bhalswa landphil site par vivaad hota dikh rahaa he
 In Miyadanorth MCD of Bhalswa landfill site, Congress leader and former leader of opposition Mukesh Goyal has also predicted a ghazipur-like accident at Bhalswa landfill site
 unhone chetavanee di he ki yadi bhalswa landphil site par kooda daalana band nahin hua to wo iskaa virodh karenge
 Mukesh Goyal is the most senior councilor of North MCD who has won the election of the councilor a record time
 unke mutabik gajipur landphil site kii tarah hi bhalswa landphil site kii miyaad bhi puri ho chuki he
 The MCD is continuously dumping garbage on it, increasing its height also continuously
 vahiin gajipur jaise haadase kaa khatra bhi bad gaya he
 Likely, an accident like Ghazipur can tell you that while constructing the Bhalswandfil site, its height was set to 20 meters, but now its height has reached about 45 meters
 bhalswa landphil site par gajipur jaisaa haadasa hone kii isliye sambhaavna he kyonki is landphil site ke neeche do taraf coloniyaan bas chuki hai, jahaan badi sankhya main log rahete hai
 If the mountain of garbage moves, then there is a danger of falling on the population below
 iske alaava is landphil site par baar-baar aag lagane se jo pradooshan hota he usase bhi dilli kii sehat par bura asar pad rahaa he
 According to Agmukesh Goyal many times, dangerous methane gases are present at Bhalswandfil site
 jisaki ek chingaari se bhi yahaan aag lag jaati he
 There was a lot of uproar during the summer last year after repeated fire incidents, but no concrete solution could be found
 aapako bataa den ki north dilli main rozaana 3 hazaar metric ton kooda nikalataa he jo bhalswa landphil site or bavana main bane west tu energy plant bheja jaataa he
 While the North MCD is going to increase the capacity of the Waste to Energy plant in Bawana, a Waste to Energy plant is also proposed in Wahembhalswa

 The unemployment rate in the country has reached a record level since 2016
 sarkaar pehle se hi saste krishi paidaavaar or naukariyon main kam badhat ko lekar vipaksh ke nishane par he
 This has been revealed by the data released by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)
 farvari, 2019 ke dauraan desh main berogari kii dar 7
 Has reached 2 percent
 yah sitambar, 2016 ke baad kaa ab tak kaa record str he
 Unemployment rate 5 in February 2018
 9 fisadi thi
 CMI is a prestigious private sector think tank, whose data is considered to be quite reliable
 samachar agency royatres ke anusaar, CMIE ke yah aankade desh bhar ke lakhon pariwaron main kiye gaye survey par aadhaarit hote hai
 Chief of CMIE Mahesh Vyas told the agency that despite the decline in the number of job seekers, there has been a record increase in the unemployment rate
 unhone kaha ki farvari main kareeb 40 karod logon ke naukari main rahane kaa anumaan he, jabaki pichley saal farvari main yah sankhya 40
 Was around 6 crores
 gauratlab he ki april se may ke bich desh main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai, aise main yah aankada modi sarkaar ke liye takalifdeh ho saktaa he
 However, the government releases data on its level of unemployment and the government has repeatedly said that the old criteria for measuring unemployment rate needs to be changed
 gat disambar maah main ek akhbaar kii report main daawa kiya gaya tha ki saal 2017-18 main berogari kaa str 45 saal ke record level par pahunch gaya he
 It was claimed in the newspaper that this is a leaked report of NSSO
 CMIE kii janvari main jari report main kaha gaya tha ki 2018 main kareeb 1
 1 crore people became unemployed
 iske liye 2016 main modi sarkaar dwaara kii gai notebandi or 2017 main lagu jiesti ko jimmedaar bataaya gaya
 The government said in Parliament last month that it does not have data on how the demonetisation has affected jobs
 vyas ne kaha ki farvari main shramik bhagidaari dar 42
 7 per cent, while it was 43 in January
 2 fisadi thi
 Labor participation rate 43 in February 2018
 8 fisadi thi
 Reduced labor participation means that the number of job seekers has also declined
 ise or berogari dar ko jod diya jaae to samasya or gaharaa jaati he
 The newspaper then published that the unemployment rate in India was 6 in 2017-18, according to a survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office
 1 fisadi rahi
 There was a lot of controversy as soon as this report was leaked and the opposition got a chance to attack
 haalanki, abhi tak eneseso ne berogari kaa aankada jari nahin kiya he
 According to CMIE estimates, India has a working-age population of about 2 every year
 3 karod bad jaati he
 If 42 to 43 per cent of it is estimated to join the labor force, then 96 million to 99 lakh new people are added to the labor force every year

 But the family says their daughter's handwriting is not on the suicide note

 The deceased student has been identified as 13-year-old Madhu Marawi, a resident of Bhimkhundi village

 Everyone was puzzled as to why he hanged
 mahaj 13 saal kii ladki ke saath aisa kya hua ki usne maut ko lage lagane kaa khaufnak faisla kar liya
 According to the police, Madhu Maravi's body hanged near the common bathroom outside the hostel room
 soochna milane par police ne maukey par jaakar laash ko neeche utaara or madhu ke kamare kii chaanbin kii
 The police then recovered a suicide note there
 chaatra kii maut kii khabar paakar dm or police adheekshak bhi maukey par pahunch gaye
 Other students were also frightened by this incident
 police ne madhu kii laash ko postmortem ke liye bhijwaya
 Now the police had the suicide note in his hand, which was recovered from Madhu's room
 police usee ko aadhaar maanakar aage bad rahi thi
 Information was already given to the girl's family members
 lihaaja, parivaar ke log police ke paas pahunche
 Police showed the suicide note recovered from Madhu's room to her family members
 jise dekhakar parivaar vaale sakate main aa gaye
 The suicide note states that Madhu wants to become a teacher, but upon coming to Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, she felt that she had come to hell
 lekin maamle main doosraa mode us vakt aayaa, jab madhu ke parivaar waalon ne police ko bataaya ki suicide note main unki beti kii handriting nahin he
 Her father is claiming that the case of his daughter's death is suspicious, so the case should be investigated by the CBI
 madhu ke parijanon ne kaha ki wo jab jawahar navoday vidhyalay ai thi, to bahut khush thi
 Also, the height at which the rope was tied to hang
 wo bhi maamle ko shaq ke ghere main laata he
 The family clearly says that Madhu's death is not a suicide
 maamle ko aasaani se nipataane kii firaaq main juty police ke liye parivaar kaa daawa nai chunauti banakar saamne aa gaya
 The case which the police were trying to settle as mere suicide
 ab vah maamla ulajhata ja rahaa he
 The administration of Navodaya Vidyalaya is also under target due to the claim of family members
 principal kaa kahana he ki madhu ne tanaav main aakar aisa kiya
 In this case, the police is now waiting for the post-mortem report
 police jaananaa chaahati he ki kahin madhu ke saath koi anhoni to nahin hui
 Also, the police has now decided to match the handwriting of the suicide note recovered from Madhu's room with Madhu's handwriting
 iske liye suicide note ko handriting export ke paas bheja ja rahaa he

 Sarma's absence for the first time since Tarun Gogoi became Chief Minister in 2001 confirmed the long-standing suspicion in the minds of people that he was no longer the most trusted lieutenant of Assam Chief Minister Gogoi
 apane is ekala avatar main mukhyamantri ek dayaneey shakhsiyat ban gaye hai
 The Congress high command is angry with him
 rashtriya media un par tut padaa he or vipakshi partiyaan un par waar kiye ja rahi hai
 Sarma, a minister from Assam's Barak Valley, says, "sarma has been a troubleshooter for him all these years
" ab ham yah jaan gaye hai ki rajya ko vastav main koun chalaa rahaa tha
 "he is loyal to every government department and also has good support among Congress workers from across the state which helps him," says another Congress minister from the state
 ''saal 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan gogoi ne rajya kii kuch chuninda jagahon par hi chunaav prachaar kiya tha kyonki vah heart surgery ke baad swasthya laabh kar rahe the

 After the Chief Minister's son Gaurav's entry into politics, relations started growing further
 jab zyaadaatar mantri daudkar 'assam ke rajkumaar' kaa abhivadan karne gaye, sarama dur hi rahe
 "if Gaurav calls a minister and wants to meet him, the minister reaches his house," says a Congress MLA
 lekin sarama vinamrata se is yuva netaa ko apane ghar yaa offis main aane ke liye kehete hai
 Tensions between Sarma and Gogoi deepened in Ahdel when there were reports that Sarma had secretly met Sonia Gandhi to suggest the name of Chief Minister Gogoi for the vice-president
 haalanki, sarama ne iskaa khandan kiya lekin gogoi kii van mantri rakibul hossain ke saath nazdikiyaan badhane lagi jo gaurav ke bahut kareebi hai

 In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party has lost its third consecutive election
 narendra modi kii lahar main sapa kaa siyaasi kila puri tarah se dhwast ho gaya he
 While Akhilesh Yadav entered the electoral fray with Mayawati in this time's Lok Sabha elections, he still could not win the party
 vahiin, akhilesh yadav ke chachaa shivpal yadav sapa se baghawat kar alag party banaakar chunavi maidan main utre, lekin wo apni jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa sake
 There has been continuous churning over the last three days due to the sp's poor defeat
 aise main sawaal he ki akhilesh or shivpal sab kuch lutaakar kya phir saath aaenge?upi main 90 ke dashak main mulaayam singh yadav ne jis sapa kii neenv rakhi thi, soobe main aaj us party kii siyaasi jameen puri tarah se khisak chuki he
 Despite the SP-BSP alliance, Akhilesh Yadav could not stop his party's poor defeat in Uttar Pradesh
 is haar ke baad sapa main manthan kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 For the last three days, there has been a continuous meeting between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav
 mulaayam-akhilesh main manthanmodi lahar main sapa kii khiski siyaasi jameen ko dobaaraa se waapas laane kii ranneeti par akhilesh ke saath mulaayam lagaataar manthan kar rahe hai
 It is believed that large-scale changes can be made in the organization
 saath hi is baat kii bhi charchaa joro par he ki akhilesh yadav dobaaraa se party ko majoobati pradaan karne ke liye said line chal rahe jamini netaaon ko tavajjon denge
 Apart from this, the veteran leaders of the party who have left the SP can also be re-entered into the party
 kya shivpal kii hogi vaapasi?vahiin, duusari ore akhilesh yadav ke chachaa shivpal yadav ne samaajawaadee party chhodkar apni alag party banaai
 He contested from Firozabad but could not get even one lakh votes in this seat which is called Shivpal's stronghold and his bail was forfeited
 iske alaava shivpal yadav ne soobe kii jin siton par apane ummidavaar utaare, unamem se ek bhi pratyaashee ek lakh voton kaa aankada nahin chhu paaya
 In this way Shivpal's political future began to be questioned
 shivpal yadav ke kareebi sutron kii maane to wo sapa main vaapasi ke liye taiyaar hai
 For this, Mulayam Singh Yadav has started batting in his favor
 haalanki, kannauj main dimple yadav kii haar ke peeche shivpal yadav ko jimmedaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 Some audio has also been narrated to Akhilesh Yadav for this
 haalanki, ye baat alag he ki kannauj hi nahin balki soobe main sapa kaa puri tarah se safaya ho gaya he
 Even after being aligned with the BSP, the SP lost its traditional seats in Kannauj, Badaun and Firozabad
 sapa ko 2014 kii tarah is baar bhi paanch siten hi mili hai, lekin yah siten mainpuri, azamgarh, rampur, muradabad or sanbhal hai
 Of these, Akhilesh and Mulayam Singh have won two, while three Muslim mps have managed to win
 sutron kii maane to shivpal kii sapa main etry ke liye philhal akhilesh yadav taiyaar nahin hai
 In such a situation, Mulayam Singh has argued that Shivpal Yadav is a man of the organization and can play an important role in rebuilding the party
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki shivpal or akhilash kya saare gile shikave bhulaakar ek saath aaenge

 Surya Namaskar was organized in many parts of the country on the one and a half hundredth birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda
 lekin bihar main is kaarykram par khub vivaad ho rahaa he
 Amid controversy, BJP leader and Surya Namaskar Organizing Committee chairman Tarakant Jha demanded that Surya Namaskar should be included in the syllabus
 udhar bihar vidhansabha main vipaksh ne sarkaar par aarope lagaae ki soobe main sarkari nirdesh par is kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the Bihar government had earlier issued instructions to school students to attend this program, but that instruction was opposed by some organizations after which the government changed the order and left the decision to people to join Surya Namaskar
 sarkaar ke is faisle par bijepi netaa or pashupaalan mantri giriraaj singh ne nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the state government withdrew its order under the pressure of vote bank politics
 samuhik surya namaskara or vivaad kaa naata nayaa nahin he
 
 
 Of course, the controversy over community Surya Namaskar is new for Bihar
 beshak yahaan pehali baar surya namaskara ke samuhik aayojan par kadi aapatti jataai gai par bihar main itane bade paimaane par samuhik surya namaskara kaa aayojan bhi pehali baar ho rahaa he
 For the first time, the connection of dispute with the community Surya Namaskar is in Madhya Pradesh
 madhyapradesh main jab se shivaraj sihan chouhan sarkaar ke raaj main samuhik surya namaskara kaarykram kii shuruyaat hui tab se 12 janvari yani swami vivekanand ke janmdin ke maukey par amuman har varsh iskaa aapojan hota he
 In a city where Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself attends the Surya Namaskar program, his ministers go to different districts to encourage people
 lekin hameshaa kii tarah pichley saal bhi jab surya namaskara kaarykram kaa aayojan hua or world record banane kii koshish hui to ise vivaadon ne gher liya
 Christian and Muslim organizations called it an attempt to saffronise education, and some Muslim religious leaders also issued a fatwa in protest against the plan

 melbern test ke chauthe din camentry ke dauraan kerri o'kief ne ek or vivaadaaspad bayaan diya he, jisane soshal media par hangaamaa machaa diya he
 During commentary for Fox Sports, Shane Warne told o'keeffe a problem on air
 worne ne o'kief ko bataaya ki unhen bhartiya cricketer cheteshwar pujaara or rabindra jadeja jaise bhartiya naamon kaa uccharan karne main pareshaani hoti he
 What then was Carey o'keeffe giving Warne such an answer, which sparked controversy
 ran jad rahe the mayank agarwal, majaak uda rahe the kangaroo camentatero'kief ne worne ko jawaab diya, 'aap apane bachche kaa naam cheteshwar, jadeja kyon rakhenge
 'after which his fellow commentators also quipped
 o'kief kii is nasleey tipanni ke baad twitor par phens ne unhen aade haathon liya he
 Some fans even went as far as to say that he would not be seen commenting after this match
 Has o'keefe already decided that he is doing his final commentary stint? Coz this ain't comms
 These are just bad, racist remarks
 # ausvind— Aishu Haridas (@imaishu_)december 29, 2018couldn't agree more
 It's one thing to attempt to humor, however manufactured, but Kerry o'keefe in particular has only made a fool of himself when talking about most things Indian through this series

 Accompanied by cackling giggles, and said in a tone that drips with what increasingly sounds like casual racism
 - Saurabh Somani (@ saurabh_42) December 29, 2018 Let us know that on the first day of the Melbourne Test, Australian commentator Kerry o'keefe took a sarcasm at the Indian first-class cricket system during the commentary
 o'kief ne daawa kiya tha ki mayank agarwal ne tihara shatak 'kuch canteen staff yaa waiter' ke khilaaf jamaaya hoga
 Saying this, o'keefe made fun of Mayank and the Indian domestic bowlers

 In a special conversation from Aaj Tak, he shared many things about the film
 
 
 har vidha kii film aap kar chuke hai, ab ye 'jai ho demokrasi' kya film he?ji, hindustan bahut adbhut desh he or duniya kii sabase badi demokrasi he, lekin kuch kamiyaan hai jo desh ke swatantra hone ke dauraan nahin thi
 The way the debate takes place in Parliament, it is very painful
 ek duusare kii baat nahin sunate, chilla-chilli hoti he, gaali-galouj or marpet bhi ho jaati he
 This film is a sarcasm over events in Parliament in Bengaluru, Kashmir, Lucknow
 aakhir main sandesh jaataa he ki badi se badi mushkil kaa samaadhaan bahut aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 The film brings a smile on your face as well as a wetness in your eyes
 aap vot dete hai? kin baton kaa dhyaan rakhte hai?main vot detaa hum or insaan ke upar dhyaan detaa hum, party par nahin
 Has he read, written, does society serve, i take care of all these things
 aapako nahin lagata ek hi taraf kii film kar rahe hai
 'dirty Politics' followed by 'jai Ho Democracy'
 'darty politics' main gambhir mudda tha, bhrasht netaaon ke upar kii kahani thi or yahaan hasi majaak ke saath raajnneetik galiyare kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 So both are different stories
 aapane bollywood or hollywood donon jagah kaam kiya he, kya antar he?abhi bollywood main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he , lekin kahani ke taur par ham abhi bahat peeche hai
 What are the types of cinema that you would like to do now? My first love is cinema which is connected with social reality, but we do not have much choice of work choices
 to bas jo kaam aata he karata jaataa hum
 But Pratham Pyaar is always a socially connected film
 kya aapako wo pehla din yaad aata he, jab aapane shooting ke dauraan camere kaa saamana kiya ho?ji, 1975 main film institute kii ek film kii thi 'chor chor chup ja', jisamen maine pehali baar camera phase kiya tha
 Worked with children
 kis tarah ke geeton ko sunanaa pasand karte hai aap?mujhe puraane geet hi zyada pasand hai, jo 50 or 60 ke dashak ke gane hai, jinamein mithaas thi, likhaawat thi, sahitya tha
 Songs by Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh, Shailendra, Neeraj touched the heart and were part of the story
 aajkal ke gane to thope hue hote hai, shor hota he or kuch nahin
 What are the likes of sports? i like all sports, but i do not mind but i have a lot of trouble that we have kept the cricketers from God
 baaki khel jaise footbal, wollyboul, basketbaal, hockey ko koi sthaan yaa tavajjo nahin di ja rahi he
 Cricketers are becoming Arabs and Kharabapathis and when players from other sports come back to play, they have to go home in an auto and a taxi
 ye bahut hi durbhagyapurna he
 Hockey is born in our country and sorry but the energy and stamina that is used in hockey and football is not in any other sport

 bhartiya vaigyanik nai agni-6 missile bana rahe hai, jo chah hajaar kilometre tak maar kar sakati he
 The most important thing about this missile is that it can carry many nuclear weapons and can target multiple targets simultaneously

 ab ham 'agni-6' bananaa chaahate hai jisase hamaari takat kai guna bad jaaegi
 He did not say the distance the missile being developed could hit, but said that its ability to increase defense strength manifold is that it can independently target multiple targets simultaneously
 
 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) Last year, DRDO successfully tested the Agni-5 missile, which has a range of 5000 km, but can only target a single location, but the 'agni-6' is equipped with multiple independent re-entry vehicles

 apane hotel ke kamare main baithkar beficri vaale andaaj main video game controlar par ungliyaan dauda rahe mahendra singh dhoni kii nazren sidney harbar brij kii ore jhaank rahi thim
 Their focus was actually on the dark clouds surrounding the city, which were slowly turning into storms and leaving a flash of lightning behind
 mausam main is tarah ke badlaav dhoni ke liye koi nae nahin hai
 Black clouds and lightning behind - all the charges, Dhoni has withstood everything
 achaanak chaar saal pehle vankhede stadium main aakhri gend par vah yaadgaar chakka unke jehan main kaundh gaya or uske turant baad sidney cricket ground kii dhundhlee tasviir saamne aa gai jahaan unki team ko do din baad australia ke khilaaf 2015 ke vishwa cap kaa semifinal khelnaa tha
 What was written in the destiny of the man whose magic touch was lost somewhere and he returned to this biggest tournament by the end? Today, the blue T-shirt was defeated in front of the home team before the fans
 Team India is out of the tournament
 aise main dhoni kaa smriti lekh likhnaa behad aasaan hoga
 But the reality is that just as India's one-day captain took the team from the shock of not winning a single match in any format against the home team in 85 days in Australia and took them to the semi-finals with an unstoppable record in the World Cup— He was sensational, even though he was finally defeated
 mumkin he, yah unka aakhri vishwa cap ho or bharat ke adamya captain ke rup main unke gine-chune match hi bache hon lekin yah sach he ki dhoni ne bharat ke van-de khel par amit chhap chodi he or ek aisa maanak tay kar diya he jiske aadhaar par ateet ke or bhavi captainon kaa moolyankan kiya jayega
 So how did Dhoni regain his shine after overcoming the turmoil caused by the Mudgal Commission's fiery report on betting and match-fixing regarding the field defeats and his IPL team Chennai Super Kings? Was this comeback story written with a magic pen or was it a cleverly crafted plan? Sources connected with the Indian cricket team just ten days before the start of the World Cup, Dhoni and the Indian team's birth Consider the most important aspect of the resurrection story
 us subah unke saathiyon ko ummid thi ki captain dhoni unase kahenge ki vah fatafat ghar jaakar apni beti ko apni baahon main lekar laut aaenge
 Instead, Dhoni came and said that he would stay in Australia and contribute to a strategy to get the team out of the crisis
 majboot netaa phir se khadaa ho rahaa tha or achaanak lakshya sabake saamne saaf ho gaya tha
 The person inside the dressing room told, "we all knew that if the World Cup started, what else would be worse than this
 lekin phir bhi team main hichak thi, anischitata thi; dar andar tak samaaya hua tha
 But when captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided that even his greatest personal happiness could not be an obstacle in his path to complete his life in the World Cup, then he began to handle the situation suddenly
 us din sab kuch badal-sa gaya
 "the roadmap for the improvement of Indian cricket was beginning to take shape at the end of a four-test series in which India lost 2–0
 haalanki australia or england ke khilaaf trikoniya van-de siries main nattejey or bhi kharaab rahe lekin dhoni ne himmat nahin haari
 Coach Duncan Crulcher started working on the stance of most batsmen, including in-form Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane
 ab ve pichon par apane paanv failaakar khadey hote hai or balle ko behatar santulan ke liye donon paanvon ke thik bich main rakhte hai
 They are now far away from the traditional position in which the bat was placed behind the right foot
 apni baaten bebaaki se saamne rakhane main kabhi sankoch na karne vaale team diarector ravi shastri ne apane saath under-19 or ek-do test maichon main khel chuke team ke gendbaaji coach bharat arun ke saath apni samaj kaa phayda uthaate hue test or van-de maichon main saamne ai bhartiya tej gendbaajon kii kamajoriyon par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Dhoni left his place to rectify all these technical problems
 lekin dimagi jadtaaon ko dur karne kaa kaam tab shuru hua jab trikoniya siries ke final main pahunchane main team ke naakaam rahane par captain apane tej gendbaajon ko edilade se 200 kilometre dur ek boot camp main le gaye
 There he asked the bowlers to set new goals for themselves before the World Cup
 kai sari dimagi kavayadon ke baad nishkarsh yah niklaa ki tej gendbaaj yaa to bahut short gend phenk rahe the yaa phir bahut phul
 Over the next few days, he focused on hitting the ball at three-quarters of the length — first at a moderate pace and then slowly at a slow pace until he was able to easily bowl more than 140 kilometers per hour
 
 uske baad dhoni ne unke saath virdohi ballebaajon kii majbootiyon or kamajoriyon par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Some batsmen were selected from each team, who were suddenly put on short-pitched balls as possible targets to be shocked
 is bich captain ne ravichandran asina ko hawa main dhimi gati kii gend phenkane kii koshish karne ko kaha or spinner ke rup main shastri kaa anubhav isamen kaaphi kaam aayaa
 Shastri then took Ashwin to former Australian off-spinner Bruce Yardley who suggested that Ashwin should spin the ball more to be more successful in these situations
 nattejey jaldi hi saamne aane lage—pehle nets par or phir vishwa cap ke shuruaati maichon main bhi
 The three main fast bowlers, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma together took 48 wickets in the tournament
 yah dekhte hue ki toornament ke match kitne haai-scoring rahe hai, aswin ne 4
 Succeeded to take 13 wickets at a very economical rate of 28 runs per over
 england ke purv captain maaikel won ne sidney main kaha, "maine kabhi yah ummid nahin kii thi ki bhartiya team itani jaldi or itani kamyaabi ke saath rukh badal legi
 Dhoni is a very clever captain and cast his magic on his players in ICC tournaments
 ve harry potter kii tarah hai
 "vaughan's former partner Kevin Pietersen says much of the change in Team India is due to Dhoni
 australia main camentator ke rup main maujuud petersan ne india today se kaha, "ve maukon kaa intjaar karke ghaatak prahaar karne main yakeen karte hai
 He did the right by feeding five specialist bowlers and he had the confidence to call him in any position and ask him to bowl
 "bharat ke ek chatur or kaamyaab captain maane jane vaale saurav ganguli, jinaki kabhi haar na maanane vaali bhaavana hi shaayad dhoni ne viraasat main pai, dhoni ko khud se behatar captain aankate hai
 Says Ganguly, "they don't look colorful in Test matches but they are awesome in limited overs games
 australia ke khilaaf lagaataar khelte rahane se, bhale hi haar milti rahi ho, unhen majbootee mili
 Dhoni was sensible as he kept the team united and ensured that they learn a lesson from defeat
 test kii captaini se istipha dene se unhen vishwa cap main nai urja hasil hui
 “things have not been so easy though
 mudgal kamishan kii report kii vajah se bisisiai ke purv pramukh en
 After the removal of Srinivasan, Dhoni went into the shell almost as if
 mana jaataa he ki report main jin 'anaam vyaktiyon' kaa zikr he, unamem se dhoni bhi ek hai
 His relations with Srinivasan are deep — through IPL and also through India Cements in which Dhoni is the vice-president
 isliye mana jaataa he ki yah dharna puri tarah niraadhaar bhi nahin he ki mahendra singh dhoni ko bhi is sambandh kaa khaasaa phayda mila hoga or ab bhi aise kai sawaal hai jinka jawaab dhoni ko dena he taaki us masale par chaaya dhundhalaka hat sake
 Under this pressure, he not only cut himself off from the Indian media on tour but it seems that he also started opposing his interest in the affairs of the Indian team
 vishwa cap ke najadik aate-aate yah saaf ho rahaa tha ki test cricket main unka pradarshan neeche gir rahaa tha
 Realizing that the team management under selector and flamboyant Ravi Shastri felt the need for a new refreshment which was now difficult for him to deliver, captain Dhoni suddenly lost his Test cricket before the Sydney Test after losing the series
 Took retirement yah kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki is sthiti main viraat kohli ke turat-phurat captain banane ke saath hi dhoni ke liye aage ke safar par viraam lag jayega
 But possibly after the start of the World Cup, the team got the benefit of mutual understanding between these two
 andar ke log inhen ek-duusare ke dhur virdohi bataate the lekin kohli or dhoni ne is toornament ke dauraan ek-duusare kaa bharpoor saath diya or halaat ko badal daalaa
 They were seen walking along the streets, eating together, and even buying video game consoles before the match against the West Indies in Perth on 6 March
 test captain banane ke baavjood is toornament ke liye nirvivaad netaa ke taur par dhoni ke peeche kohli ne puraa jor laga diya or jab bhi jarurat padi, donon saath khadey najar aae
 Dhoni has always been an enigma as a captain, a player and a man
 apane kariyar ke uttarardh main ve spasht rup se test cricket ke prati aruchi rakhte najar aae or bhartiya team unke netritv main ek ke baad ek videshi siries harati chali gai
 But his penchant for winning trophies in ODI cricket, and especially in ICC tournaments, has made him obsessive
 haalanki ve kabhi apane man ke bhav apane chehre par jhalkane nahin dete, lekin bharat ne 2013 main champions trophy jiti or 2014 ke tii 20 vishwa cap kaa final khelaa
 However, arguably the most beautiful moment of Dhoni's life was the night of the 2011 World Cup final in Wankhede
 england ke purv captain nasir hossain kehete hai, "ve bade maichon ke khilaadi hai
 He has done this job well that when needed most, he has not allowed the attention of the team to be divided
 "vishwa cap-2015 main bhi bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kai tarah kii pratikultaaon ke baavjood team ko behad najadik tak to le hi gaye

 - Naqam and oil was stopped after joining RSS, Narendra Modi stopped eating salt and oil

 1958 main deepawali ke din gujarat aresas ke pehle praant prachaarak lakshmana raav inaamdaar urf vakil sahab ne narendra modi ko bal swayamsevak kii shapath dilwaai thi
 Modi started going to RSS branches
 lekin jab modi ne chaay kii dukaan kholi to shakhaon main unka aana janaa kam ho gaya
 According to author MV Kamath, who wrote a biography of Modinarendra Modi, who used to make tea-snacks for the promoters, Narendra Modi used to make tea snacks for the pracharaks in the morning in the Hedgewar Bhavan, the office of the Gujarat RSS

 aresas netaaon kaa train or bas main rigerveshan kaa jimmaa unheen ke paas hota tha
 Not only this, Narendra Modi had to do the work of opening every letter coming to Hedgewar Bhavan in Gujarat
 narendra modi kaa management or unke kaam karne ke tareeke ko dekhne ke baad aresas main unhen badi jimmedaari dene kaa faisla liya gaya
 For this, he was called to a month-long special training camp at the national office Nagpur
 aresas ke nagpur mukhyalay main training lekar narendra modi gujarat aresas prachaarak banakar laute
 The RSS put Narendra Modi in charge of the Gujarat Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 1975 main immergency ke dauraan bhi narendra modi ke paas yahi bhoomika thi
 During the Emergency, Narendra Modi, along with his biggest political enemy Shankar Singh Baghela, worked to reinvigorate the Gujarat BJP workers and create an army of strong activists
 un dinon shankar singh baghela janata ke priy netaa the or modi ko behtareen ranneeti banane ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 Narendra Modi was a bit arbitrary from the beginning
 unke puraane saathi bataate hai ki modi raat main der se sone ke chalate aksar sangh kii subah kii shakha ke liye let ho jaaya karte the or jab sabhi kaaryakarta phul sleeve kurta pahante to narendra modi half sleeve kaa kurta pahante the

 The yatra was to begin from Tamil Nadu in the south and end by waving the tricolor in Srinagar
 
 
 
 Murali Manohar Joshi's Ekta Yatra was a great success when Narendra Modi's brilliant management of discipline gained, but one day Joshi flashed on Narendra Modi
 darasal tay ye hua tha ki rashtriya netaaon or sabhi kaaryakartaaon ko khaanaa saath khaanaa tha
 But in Bangalore, Narendra Modi disappeared along with Anant Kumar
 joshi is par bahut naaraaz hue
 In the morning, he lambasted Modi in front of the activists and asked them to remain in discipline
 joshi kii ekta yatra ke baad se hi narendra modi kii mahatvakankshaayen badhane lageen
 Modi began to feel that he should be understood as the leader of Gujarat bjp's senior leaders Keshubhai Patel and Shankar Singh Baghela

 Narendra Modi is considered to be the root of all this trouble
 tab party ne narendra modi ko rashtriya sachiv banaakar gujarat se dilli ravaanaa kar diya

 modi sakapakaakar bole- main gujarat se chah saal dur rahaa hum, tamaam muddon se dur hum, ye kaise hoga
 Well after a while he came to know that Atalji wanted to send him as the Chief Minister of Gujarat

 vitt mantri ne krishi kshetra main 'oparation green' shuru karne ke saath hi, kharif kii fasalon ke liye emspi upaj laagat se 50 fisadi zyada tay karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 But if you check the facts and do a comparative study with the Economic Survey released a few days ago, then you will feel that all these things are just paper
 bajtiy aavanton main zyada badhat nahinkrushi par bajtiy aavanton 46,700 karod rupee kaa hi kiya gaya he, jo pichley saal ke bajet se thodaa hi zyada he or kul 21 lakh karod rupee ke bajet kaa mahaj 2
 3 percent
 pichley bajet kii tulana main isamen 4,845 karod rupee kii hi badhotaree kii gai he
 In such a situation, the question arises that in such a hike, what will the government be able to accomplish by doubling the income of farmers by 2022? i am surprised to hear this
 Farmers did not get 50% profit over cost of production in the rabi season
 In fact the MSP for several crops was in reality less than the production cost
 — Devinder Sharma (@devinder_sharma)february 1, 2018emspi kaa chhalavakhrif fasal ke liye emspi main laagat se 50 fisadi zyada kii baat sunne main bahut aakarshak lagati he, lekin sach to yah he ki iske saath ek locha he
 It is not clear whether this increase will be above the cost of production
 utpaadan laagat kaa matlab he ki usamen parivaar ke shram, lagaai gai puunji, jameen ke kiraye aadi sabhi ko shaamil kiya jaae
 Farmer leaders say, 'the allocation for market intervention and price support scheme has been reduced five times from the revised estimate of last year's budget of Rs 950 crore to just Rs 200 crore
 'purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne ise mahaj dikhaave kaa bataaya he
 He said, '1 to MSP
 5 guna badhaane kaa vaada kiya gaya he, lekin iskaa koi vivaran nahin diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the amount of Rs 2,000 crore for e-markets and Rs 500 crore for Operation Green is also modest
 isse kahin yah sanket nahin miltaa ki kisaanon kii vaastavik aay badhegi
 He said, 'the problem of the agricultural sector will continue and deepen, this will continue to plight the lives of the majority people dependent on agriculture
 'FM is using sleight of hand in talking about "cost of production"
 Instead of promising 50% 'net returns' over 'C2 cost', as recommended by Swaminathan Commission, he is talking about 'gross returns' over 'A2 + FL costs'
 — Yogendra Yadav (@_yogendrayadav)february 1, 2018karj kaa zyada phayda nahinkrushi kshetra ke liye sansthagat karj vitaran ko badhaakar 11 lakh karod rupee karne kii baat kahi gai he, lekin sach to yah he ki zyaadaatar kisaan is karj vyavastha ke daayre se baahar hai
 According to the Economic Survey, an allocation of just Rs 600 crore has been made on the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojana in this financial year, while the drought and monsoon uncertainties were seen in the states
 isaki vajah se kisaan kaaphi naaraaz rahe or rajasthan sahit kai rajyon main kisaanon ne virodh pradarshan kiye
 According to the farmers' organizations, the budget talks about the welfare of landless tenant farmers, but the truth is that despite implementing the landless farmer credit scheme for the last few years, their condition has not changed
 andhra pradesh,telugana, odisha aadi rajyon main aatmahatya karne vaale zyaadaatar kisaan bhoomihin hi rahe hai
 Nothing has really been done in the budget for the interests of the tenant farmers
 'fasal beemaa kaa bhi khaas phayda nahimbajet 2018 main pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ke liye 4,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii gai he
 But past data shows that public money is just being wasted in it and in fact farmers are not doing much good

 chunki ve ek yogi hai, isliye mujhe un par bharosa he
 "family wanted to open the coffin According to the information, the family had demanded to open the coffin

 Is not
 is par vivaad kyon? charchaa hi kyon? mujhe aisa lagata he ki deshprem ko lekar kya log kanphyus hai
 i see patriotism through my songs
 deshprem kii alag-alag mudraaen he
 Who will take it forward jo kisi bhi tareeke se desh ke liye kaam karata he, vah use aage le ja rahaa he
 On the question of whether it is necessary for the poet to have grief or should there be a fire of rebellion, Prasoon Joshi said that i should stay or not
 
 
 bharat ye rahanaa chahie, isamen kahaan deshprem par sawaal uthta he
 There is love in it isamen intecity bhi he
 The antiquity in the song or poem does not necessarily come from rebellion
 prem main jo intecity he vah parvat hilaa de
 Love should be pure
 spashtataa honi chahie
 Spine is found in love
 hamaare yahaan pyaar main girte nahin hai log
 People fall in love with us here

 Along with that
 yah jaahir kaa jamaana he
 That is, disclosure
 ab aap apane man kii baat kah rahe he
 Now people have found the stage
 jab manchon kaa loktantrikkaran hua he
 So some people have a problem that now everyone's voice is coming, brother
 isliye logon ko dikkat ho rahi he ki sabhi ko manch mil gaya he
 i am with the country, not against anyone: what is the fault of the prasundeshpram
 deshprem tha isliye desh aaazaad hua
 There were some people who loved the country
 nahin hota to ham aaj bhi usee daur main rahete
 There are arrangements to organize different forums in the country
 isi vyavastha ko santulit karne kii jarurat he
 You are with the country first
 aap kisi ke khilaaf mat hoie
 When you are with the country, your anchoring will become stronger
 agar koi parivartan desh ke liye acha he to aap usase judenge
 People say why did you choose the censor board
 kyon gaye usamen
 i said that i will do it
 mujhe isamen shaamil hona chahie
 Because i have to do something for the country
 sensor board main main vivaad nahin vichaar-vimarsh le ayaakoi kalakar samaaj ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kalakaar nahin banataa

 sensor board main aane ke baad mujhe nayaa najariya mila chizon ko dekhne kaa
 i tried to see things from every angle
 main vivaadon ke bajaay vichaar-vimarsh karte hai
 Blasphemers 
 
 gale par mat chadhiejab parivartan hota he kuch log ekadam dinayal main aa jate hai
 Where is everyone talking about their enmity? parivartan main sakaaratmak he to use sweekaar karo
 People are assuming that i have to protest
 nandak niyare raakhie
 
 
 But don't put a cynic on your neck to paralyze you
 ninda se rasta nikalnaa chahie
 No one should be exterminated by condemnation
 chalo kuch saal sakaaratmak chijen dekhte hai, hameshaa negative kyon sochenmain landan main ek intervyuu kar rahaa hum
 i am not even a journalist
 main videsh main baithkar apane pradhanmantri ke saamne desh kii buraai nahin kar saktaa
 i can not do it
 mujhe samaj nahin aata ki log kya chaahate hai
 People abuse him for several days to bring down the tree on Solomon Islands
 aakhir main ped gir jaataa he
 There are such people in our country too
 jo desh ko gaali dete rahete hai
 May i see the tree of my country falling? chaliye kuch saal sundarataa dekh le
 See your strength
 apni shaktiyon kii charchaa kare
 Perhaps it can infuse new power into our country
 kyonki desh kii ninda karne se kuch nahin mila
 People quickly become judgmental, these are false signs of change in the world of literature
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki dil bada karne kii jarurat he
 If Dadgiri has come in our democracy, then the solution is that more and more people should get the platform
 main swayan ko samajhuun ki usase pehle log mujhe samaj chuke hote hai
 Let me understand myself
 agar nai cheez aapke hisaab se chalati he to log use bauddhik maanate hai
 Otherwise, he is called bad
 sakaaraatmakataa hi vikaas kaa pehali seedhi hehamaare desh main dharmon, sampradaayon or vichaaron kaa takaraav barason se chalaa aa rahaa he
 We have to plan thinking thinking about the solution
 artist ke liye to main kahata hum ek kalakaar ke bich uske shrotaaon ke bich kaa sambandh or vishwaas
 People listen to artists till this lasts
 hamen koi bhi baat sunne ke liye puure sandarbh ko sunanaa chahie
 So why take only one thing forward
 jivan main dikkatein sabake aati he
 You will now be constantly ruined by your father's son
 roji-roti ke liye dar-dar bhatakegaa
 Should we talk to people like this? isliye sakaaratmak hi sochna chahie
 The diversity of music goes on together, just we don't pay attention that the elite class of the country has been the most irresponsible
 jab is varg ke log ghar main shastreey sangeet kaa anand le rahe hai
 Then you asked the one who fed you food, wait, son, this raga is an irritation
 lekin vah jab apane ghar jaataa he apni dholak par khud kaa sangeet gaata-bajaata he
 All kinds of music are in this world
 sab ekasaath aage bad rahe hai
 Why are you wondering brother? aapane kabhi usapar dhyaan nahin diya pehle

 Meghalaya Chief Minister Konrad Sangma blamed the location of the deep tunnels for this
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki sarkaar 2014 se pratibandhit in koyala khadaanon ko kanoonee vaidhata or niyamit kiye jane ke samarthan main he
 Talking to India Today, Meghalaya Chief Minister Konrad Sangma said that the entire river itself got buried in the mine 200-300 feet below
 is khadaan kii sthiti mukhya sadak se 40-50 kilometre dur he
 We need 30 high power pumps
 yahi sabase badi lagistical chunauti
 He said divers tried to reach the tunnel but the situation was extremely difficult

 bhagwaan shiv or maa parvati kii shaadi ke bare main kai puraanon main kaha gaya he
 This was the most beautiful marriage at that time
 inke byaah ko lekar jo katha sabase adhik prachlit he, ham aapako vahi bataate hai
 
 
 Gods, demons, humans had all arrived at the wedding It is said that apart from the gods, asuras and humans, ghosts, gana etc
 were present in this marriage
 is shaadi main bade se bade or chote se chote log shaamil hue the
 Shiva is called Pashupati, so all animals, insects and animals came to attend his wedding
 yahaan tak ki bhoot-pishaach or veikshipt bhi mehmaan bane
 When Shiva and Parvati were about to get married, a big beautiful incident happened
 unki shaadi bahut hi bhavy paimaane par ho rahi thi
 Never before had such a marriage taken place
 shiv, jo duniya ke sabase tejasvi praani the, ek duusare praani ko apane jivan kaa hissaa banane vaale the
 His wedding was attended by the biggest and the smallest
 sabhi devtaa to vahaan maujuud the hi, saath hi asur bhi vahaan pahunche
 Generally, where the deities used to go, the asuras refused to go and the deities did not go where the asuras used to go
 unki aapas main bilkul nahin banati thi
 But it was Shiva's marriage, so they forgot all their quarrels and decided to come together once
 shiv pashupati hai, matlab sabhi jeevon ke devtaa bhi hai, to saare jaanavar, keede-makode or saare jeev unki shaadi main upasthit hue
 Even ghosts and vampires arrived as guests at their wedding
 yah ek shahi shaadi thi, ek rajkumaari kii shaadi ho rahi thi, isliye vivaah samaaroh se pehle ek ahm samaaroh hona tha
 The lineage of both the rituals and the bridegroom of Bakhan of the lineage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati was to be declared
 ek raja ke liye uski vanshavali sabase ahm cheez hoti he jo uske jivan kaa gaurav hota he
 So Parvati's lineage has been described with great pomp
 yah kuch der tak chalata rahaa
 Finally, when he finished the glory of his dynasty, he turned to where Shiva was sitting
 sabhi atithi intjaar karne lage ki var kii ore se koi uthakar shiv ke vansh ke gaurav ke bare main bolegaa magar kisi ne ek shabd bhi nahin kaha
 The bride's family wonders, 'is there no one in his family who can stand up and tell about the greatness of his dynasty?' But nobody really was
 var ke mata-pita, rishtedaar yaa parivaar se koi vahaan nahin aayaa tha kyonki uske parivaar main koi tha hi nahin
 He had just come with his teammates, the Ganas who looked like deformed creatures
 ve insaani bhashaa tak nahin bol pate the or ajeeb si besuri awaajen nikaalte the
 They all looked drunk and in strange states
 bhagwaan shiv ne dhaaran kiya maunphir parvati ke pita parvat raaj ne shiv se anurodh kiya, 'kripaya apane vansh ke bare main kuch bataaie
 Shiva sat silently while looking somewhere in the void
 vah na to dulhan kii ore dekh rahe the, na hi shaadi ko lekar unamem koi utsaah najar aa rahaa tha
 Shiva sat silently while looking somewhere in the void
 vah na to dulhan kii ore dekh rahe the, na hi shaadi ko lekar unamem koi utsaah najar aa rahaa tha
 He just sat surrounded by his ganas and kept staring into the void
 vadhoo paksh ke log baar-baar unase yah sawaal poochhate rahe kyonki koi bhi apni beti kii shaadi aise aadmi se nahin karnaa chahega, jiske vansh kaa ata-pataa na ho
 They were in a hurry because the auspicious time for marriage was going out fast
 magar shiv maun rahe
 People of the society, the noble king-maharaja and the pandits looked at Shiva with great disgust and immediately started whispering, 'what is its lineage? Why is it not speaking? It may be that its family is of a lower caste and is ashamed to tell it about its dynasty
 'naarad muni ne ishaare se baat samjaani chahiphir naarad muni, jo us sabha main maujuud the, ne yah sab tamaasha dekhakar apni veena uthaai or uski ek hi taar khinchate rahe
 He continued to play the same tune - Towing Towing Towing
 isse khijhakar parvati ke pita parvat raaj apana aapa kho baithe, 'yah kya bakawaas he? ham var kii vanshavali ke bare main sunanaa chaahate hai magar vah kuch bol nahin rahaa
 Should i marry my daughter to such a man? And why are you making this annoying noise? Is this an answer? Narada replied, 'the groom has no parents
 ' raja ne poocha, 'kya aap yah kahana chaahate hai ki vah apane mata-pita ke bare main nahin jaanata?'naarad ne sabhi ko bataaya ki bhagwaan swayambhu hai'nahin, inke mata-pita hi nahin hai
 They have no inheritance
 inkaa koi gotra nahin he
 It has nothing
 inke paas apane khud ke alaava kuch nahin he
 'the whole assembly was disturbed
 parvat raaj ne kaha, 'ham aise logon ko jaanate hai jo apane pita yaa mata ke bare main nahin jaanate
 Such an unfortunate situation can happen
 magar har koi kisi na kisi se janma he
 How can it be that no one has a father or a mother
 ' naarad ne jawaab diya, 'kyonki yah swayambhu hai
 He has composed himself
 inke na to pita hai na mata
 They have no clan nor family
 yah kisi parampara se taalluk nahin rakhte or na hi inke paas koi rajya he
 They have neither gotra nor any constellation
 na koi bhaagyashaalee tara inaki raksha karata he
 They are beyond all these things
 yah ek yogi hai or inhone saare astitv ko apana ek hissaa bana liya he
 There is only one lineage for them - sound
 aadi, shunya prakruti ne jab astitv main ai, to astitv main aane vaali pehali cheez thi – dhwani
 His first expression is in the form of a sound
 ye sabase pehle ek dhwani ke rup main prakat hue
 They were nothing before that
 yahi vajah he ki main yah taar khinch rahaa hum

 The Sun's entry into a sign is called Sankranti and when Suryudhanu enters the zodiac sign, it is called Dhanusankranti
 dhanurashi brihaspati kii aagney raashi he or isamen surya kaa pravesh vishesh parinaam paidaa karata he
 Diseases and diseases increase
 logon ke man main khub sari chanchalta aa jaati he
 At this time, due to astrological reasons, auspicious activities are avoided, hence it is also called Dhanu Kharmas
 is baar dhanu kharmaas 16 disambar se shuru ho rahaa he
 Why is marriage prohibited at this time? - The greatest purpose of any marriage is the attainment of happiness and prosperity
 - dhanu raashi ko sampannataa kii raashi mana jaataa he
 - At this time, the Sun enters the Sagittarius sign, which is not considered good for happiness and prosperity
 - is samay agarvivaahakiya jaae to na to bhaavnaatmak sukh milegaa or na hi shaareerik sukh
 Why not start a new business or a new job at this time? - Starting a new business in Dhanu Kharmas gives rise to economic difficulties, because at this time, expenses can increase considerably
 - is avadhi main shuru kiye hue vyavsaay bich main ruk jate hai
 - There can be a lot of debt in the business and there can be money flow among people
 nae makaan kaa nirmaan or sampatti kaa kray kyon hota he varjit?- sampatti banane kaa uddeshy sampatti kaa sukh purvak upbhog karnaa he
 - But if it is made in this time, it will be very difficult to get its happiness
 - agar aisa prayaas kiya jaae to kaam bich main baadhaon ke kaaran ruk bhi saktaa he
 - Sometimes the chances of accidents are also formed
 - is avadhi main banaae gaye makaan aam taur par kamjor hote hai or unase nivas kaa sukh nahin mil paata he
 What works can be done in Dhanu Kharmas? - Marriage can be done if it is a matter of love marriage or swayamvara
 - agar kundali main brihaspati dhanurashimen ho to bhi is avadhi main shubh kaary kiye ja sakate hai
 - There is no bond or pressure of Kharmas in doing the tasks that are being done regularly
 - seemaant, jatakarm or annaprashan aadi karm purv nishchit hone se is avadhi main kiye ja sakate hai
 On whom will this zodiac sign of the Sun have a bad effect and good for whom? - It will not be good for those who have anger, blood pressure remains high
 - jin logon ko haddiyon kii samasya he, unhen vishesh dhyaan dena chahie
 - Those whose zodiac sign is Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Libra or Capricorn can cause problems
 - jo log prashasan ke kshetra main yaa aadhyatm ke kshetra main hai, unhen laabh hoga
 - Those who rise before sunrise, they will be saved from all difficulties
 - mesh, singh, vrishchik, dhanu or kumbh raashi ke liye yah parivartan laabhakaari hoga
 The whole country is shocked by the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 sanyukt raashtra se lekar america, rus or france jaise deshon ne is ghatana kii ninda kii he or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main bharat ke samarthan kii baat kahi he
 But generally speaking on every occasion, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who talks about amno-aman, has kept silence about this attack
 pulavama main yah aatanki hamalaa tab hua he jab aaj se (ravivaar) se paris main finantial ection task force (efeetief) kii 5 divasiy baithak honi he
 In which all countries including India have presented evidence of terrorist funding on Pakistan
 lihaaja efeetief kii baithak se pehle ise imran kii kootnithik chuppi samajha ja saktaa he
 Qamar Aga, a senior journalist with foreign affairs and a watchdog on Pakistan, said in a conversation with 'aaj Tak' that Pakistan is currently facing an economic crisis
 aise main bharat-paak ke bich tanaav kii sthiti islamabad ko suut karti he
 Because this will shift the focus elsewhere and this is what Pakistan wants
 qamar aagaa ne kaha ki pakistan pehle se hi efeetief kii grey list yani nigaraanee suchi main shaamil he
 In such a situation, this meeting in Paris becomes more important today when all countries including America, European Union, France, Germany have asked Pakistan to eliminate terrorism from their land
 sabooton kaa dogier taiyaridhar bharat bhi efeetief (FATF) kii baithak ke maddenjar sakriy ho gaya he
 After the Pulwama attack, all agencies have been asked to prepare a dossier of evidence against Pakistan and hand it over to the Ministry of External Affairs
 isse pehle suraksha maamalon kii cabinet cameti kii baithak main pakistan ko diya gaya most faverd nesan (MFN) kaa states waapas le liya gaya he
 As a result, any goods imported from Pakistan will now attract 200 per cent custom duty
 antarrashtriya dabaav ke bich bharat kaa yah prayaas rahegaa ki pehle se hi aarthik morche par jujh rahe pakistan ko vaishvik str par alag-thalag kiya jaae
 Qamar Aga says Imran Khan is waiting for this meeting to end
 kyonki islamabad ne aatank kii funding rokane ke liye ek blue print pichhali baithak main efeetief ko saunpa tha
 Masood Azhar's handiwork will be heavy
 Let us know that in the last meeting of FATF, Pakistan was included in the gray-list
 is baithak main bharat samet duniya ke anya deshon ne lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad jaise aatanki sanghathanon dwaara dhan ugaahi or banking system ke upyog karne ke saboot pesh kiye
 The United Nations has banned these terrorist organizations
 pakistan lagaataar is suchi se baahar nikalne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 But after taking responsibility for the Pulwama attack by jaish-e-mohammad, the road to Pakistan will not be easy in FATF
 efeetief kii yah ahm baithak pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii chuppi kaa taatkaalik kaaran ho saktaa he
 But another big reason for this may also be the relationship of Imran's party Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) with the intelligence agency ISI and Jaish
 bataa den ki jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar ko pakistan kii khufia agency iesai kaa samarthan hasil he
 India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has himself confirmed that the ISI supported Taliban terrorists in the 1999 Kandahar aircraft hijack incident
 is ghatana main masood ajahar samet 3 aatanki chode gaye the
 Let us tell you that Imran Khan's party emerged as the largest party in the general elections held in Pakistan last year
 tab europea sangh ke chunaav paryvekshakon ne sawaal uthaae the ki chunaav se pehle pakistan ke raajnneetik maahaul ne nateezon ko prabhavit kiya
 Pakistan's Human Rights Commission had also claimed that there were sufficient grounds to question the credibility of the election
 aakhir ye sanghathan kis ore ishaara kar rahe the, ise samajhane ke liye hame un ghatnakramon par najar daalani hogi
 After the Pathankot Air Force base attack, the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, accepting the role of Jaish, ordered the arrest of Masood Azhar and other terrorists
 chunaav main imran ko mila tha masood kaa samarthanalekin pakistani sena ne yah sunishchit kiya ki masood ajahar or uske saathiyon kii giraftaar na kii jaae, balki unhen iesai ke kisi sef house main hiraasat main rakhaa jaae
 So that neither the Sharif government nor the Government of India could touch Masood Azhar
 sharif ke is kadam par masood ajahar ne unhen 'gaddaar' or musharraf va jaradaari se bhi badtar kaha tha
 After Nawaz Sharif's name appeared in the Panama Papers, the Pakistan Army got a chance to overthrow him through the judiciary
 jabaki ajahar masood ne chunaav ke dauraan punjab praant main khulkar imran khan ke samarthan main prachaar kiya
 Islamabad High Court judge Ajir Siddiqui had made serious allegations on the general election in Pakistan
 unhone kaha tha ki khufia agency iesai ne nyaayik maamalon main hastkshep kiya or aarope lagaaya ki iesai ne hoicourt ke chif justise ko kaha tha ki chunaav khatm hone tak navaj sharif or unki beti mariyam jail se baahar na aaen
 After taking over Pakistan's power, Imran Khan merely advocated negotiating with India in statements, and on the other hand Masood Azhar, under the aegis of the army and ISI, continued to have an open leeway to expand his organization
 jaahir he jis sena or iesai kii vajah se imran khan ko kursi mili he unke haath masood ajahar ko lekar bandhe hi rahenge
 Because the Pakistani army and ISI are fighting proxy war against India, Masood Azhar is also the biggest piece of the chessboard and the dear one of both
 rashtramandal khelgaumv ke nirmaan main aniyamittaaon kaa pataa chalane ke baad sarkaar ne sakht rukh akhriyaar karte hue nijee builder company ammar-mgf dwaara di gayi 183 karod rupye kii bank guarantee jabt karne or uske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kaa nirdesh diya
 The Urban Development Ministry gave these instructions to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which had given the contract for construction of the sports village
 mantralay sutron ne bataaya ki khel gaanv main vibhinn gadabadiyon ko dekhte hue didie ko ammar-mgf dwaara di gayi 183 karod rupye kii bank guarantee jabt karne ko kaha he
 Following this instruction, the builder company will not be able to withdraw the bank guarantee
 ek din pehle hi didie ne mantralay ko antarim report saunpi thi jisamen kaha gaya he ki khel gaanv ke nirmaan main kai aniyamittaaon or gadabadiyon kaa khulaasa hua he
 Apart from the forfeiture of the bank guarantee, the Urban Development Ministry has in a letter to the DDA Vice President asked to initiate legal action against the company
 sutron ke anusaar pariyojna vikaas samjhaute main yah praavdhaan he ki pariyojna ke karyanvayan main kami or aniyamitata paae jane par bank guarantee jabt kii ja sakati he or kanoonee karrwai kii ja sakati he
 The DDA has prepared this report on the instructions of Urban Development Minister Jaipal Reddy
 antarim report ke anusaar develper company samay se pariyojna kaa karyanvayan nahin kar saki or sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane ke liye dilli jal board, bisies jaise nikaayon ko bhugtan kiye
 The report also mentions large-scale deficiencies in construction

 kendriya grih mantralay kii ore se sansad main die gaye aankadon ke mutabik pichley kuch varshon main mahilaon kaa peechha karne (stalking) ke maamalon main teji se badhotaree hui he
 Statistics shared in Parliament show that in 2016 7200 cases of stalking were registered and 7073 accused persons were charged but only 480 could be convicted
 ye aankade 29 rajyon or 7 centre shasit pradeshon ke hai
 In 2015 only 6266 cases of Stalking were reported
 isse ek saal pehle 2014 main aise 4699 maamle darj hue
 The worrying thing is that while there is an increase in such cases, the rate of proving the crime is decreasing
 2014 main jahaan aparaadh sabit hone kii dar jahaan 34
 8%, down from 26 in 2015
 4% rah gai
 Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Hansraj Ahir informed the Parliament of the data from 2014 to 2016
 agar rajyon kii baat kii jaae to 2016 main stacking ke sabase zyada 1587 maamle maharashtra main report hue
 Maharashtra police chargesheeted 1580 people
 inamen se sirf 35 ko hi adaalaton kii ore se doshi tehraaya ja sakaa
 It is evident that the police could not gather such evidence against most of the accused on the basis of which the courts would convict them
 maharashtra main pichley kuch varshon se stacking ke maamle har saal badhate ja rahe hai
 The Uttar Pradesh Police's record has been better in bringing the culprits to justice in the case of stalking
 yahaan 754 logon ko chargeshit kiya gaya
 Out of these, 200 people were proved guilty
 desh ke kisi bhi rajya main aise maamalon main ye dosha sabit hone kii sabase zyada dar he
 Telangana ranked second in the list of highest stalking cases registered in 2016, Delhi on third, Madhya Pradesh on fourth and Uttar Pradesh on fifth
 telugana main 1096, dilli main 835 or madhya pradesh main 820 stacking ke cese darj hue
 Delhi is ranked after Uttar Pradesh in the conviction rate, where 59 out of 609 chargesheets were found guilty
 tisare number par madhya pradesh he jahaan 59 par dosha sabit hua
 The blame was proved on 35 in Maharashtra and 30 in Haryana
 2015 kii baat kii jaae to maharashtra main 1400, dilli main 1124, telugana main 766, andhra pradesh main 551 or uttar pradesh main 519 cese darj hue
 This year also the rate of defect proved was seen in Uttar Pradesh only
 yahaan 219 logon ko salaakhon ke peeche bheja gaya
 Talking of the two union territories, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Lakshadweep, the record in this case has been very clear
 yahaan 2014 se 2016 main ek bhi stacking kaa maamla darj nahin hua
 After this comes the number of northeastern states where very few such cases were registered

 pehle chunaav se lekar satrahavin loksabhaa tak prati voter kharch main nau hajaar fisadi se zyada kii badhotaree hui
 India is not only the largest democracy in the world, but the budget of this election conference to be held in five years has also increased faster than the rest of the countries
 pehle chunaav main saath paisa prati voter kharchaa tha jo aaj satrahavin loksabhaa ke samay 55 rupye par pahunch gaya he
 One of the biggest reasons recommended by the Law Commission of India to hold simultaneous elections was the rising electoral expenditure
 1952 main pehla chunaav tha or sabakuch shuruyaat se hona tha
 Total 10 from ballot paper to election preparations
 45 karod rupye kaa bajet rakhaa gaya tha
 Although the budget for the second election held in 1957 was almost halved but after that the election budget continued to increase but in 1977 the election budget was doubled from the previous election budget
 1971 main chunaav kaa kharch 11
 61 crores and it increased to 23 in 1977
 03 karod rupye par pahunch gaya
 On the basis of the electoral budget and the number of voters, the cost per voter is seen to increase steadily
 1977 main prati voter kharch jahaan 71 paise tha vahiin 1980 yah dedh rupye prati voter par pahunch gaya
 For the seventeenth Lok Sabha i
e
 2019 Lok Sabha, this expenditure can reach 5 thousand crores
 yani nabbe karod voters ke hisaab se dekhen to prati voter par hone vaale kharch main 9067 fisadi kii badhotaree hui he
 Although the price of rupee has not been taken into it, it is not a minor expense
 kharchon main sabase zyada badhotaree pandrahavi loksabhaa ke baad shuru hua
 In this election held in 2009, where the expenditure was Rs 12 per voter, in the sixteenth Lok Sabha, this expenditure increased by 241 per cent to Rs 41
 is baar mana ja rahaa he ki chunaav karaane kaa kharch kareeb 5 hajaar karod rupye tak pahunch jayega
 Accordingly, the expenditure on 90 crore voters will be seen as per every voter, then the expenditure will be Rs 55 per voter
 loksabhaa par hone vaale kharchon ko centre sarkaar vahan karti he jabaki vidhaan sabha ke chunavi vyavastha par hone vaale kharchon ko rajya sarkaar chukaati he

 yugers kaa yah bhi kahana ki mekars ne itnaa sab hone par bhi aarti or shahanaz ke khilaaf koi ection nahin liya, balki unhen sahi bataakar saport kiya
 Let me tell you what social media users are saying? Though i am a # asimriazsupporter! # sidharthdeygot the worst burn out of d hand holding task! This is clearly inhuman & downright unacceptableno one deserves this kind of torture, 't raise his voice against this # artisingh & # shehnaazgillshould apologize! pic

 com / qlgu9axjrf— Follow Krutika BB13♥️💁🏻♀️ (@realkrutika)october 30, 2019 What to do now, appoint the best ministers in social affairs ministries
 laffaaj vichaarak nahin, jaldbaaj log bhi nahin, apni party ke sadasyon, doston or parivaar waalon par meharbaani barasaane vaale bhi nahin
 Party loyalists are not ponies, not just pretenders to a particular constituency
 beshak, koi aisa bhi nahin, jise apane sukun kii bahut zyada phikr ho
 People who have the intellectual urge to know why these problems become so rare
 itnaa sara paisa kharch karke bhi hasil itnaa maamuli kyon he? aise log, jo dhairya ke saath seekhney kii koshish karen, jinamein nijee hiton ke khilaaf satat sangharsh chhedgaye kii ichhashakti ho
 Teachers who do not want to teach, doctors absent from work, companies, who are happily dissolving poison in rivers and all those who are looting this country, there should be a continuous struggle against all
 yah sab itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 There is always a rush to start new schemes
 jab jahaan mumkin ho, tatkaal nai sarkaar kaa thappa lag jaae
 But if the new minister gets a chance to work properly then he will need time to do it
 dhairya bahut jaruri he
 What to do in 100 days: 100 days of the beginning is the time to work thoughtfully, later, who are expected to be unpopular for a few days only
 yah bilkul saaf he ki shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon kaa sabase bura pahalu phir sataha par aa jayega
 Cheap private schools that provide education to children belonging to a large number of poor sections are being oppressed by stating the minimum requirements of strange kind
 masalan, shikshakon kii tankhwaah kitni honi chahie, skool kii building kisi dikhni chahie
 a hundred days is not enough to decide how this law should be reformed, but it can be prevented from implementing it so that schools can keep running
 jaahir he ki isse bavaal hoga
 The powerful teachers of government teachers in the capital and their partners will make noise
 lekin jo kadam sthitiyon ko or rochak bana degaa, vah yah ki petroleum padaarthon par di jane vaali sabsidi khatm kar di jaae
 It has been clear long ago that these things are bad for our environment and are going to push us back
 is faisle ko thodaa sukhad banane ke liye sarkaar ko yah bhi elaan kar dena chahie ki maujuuda petroleum sabsidi kaa 50 fisadi hissaa universal cash transfar par kharrch kiya jayega
 No tax system is required for transfer of cash in a year
 har kisi ko yuidi yaa vishisht pahchaan patr dene se yah sunishchit karne main aasaani hogi ki koi do baar iskaa laabh na le sake
 If everyone has their own bank account, then transfer will be easy
