 He had said, "salman used to beat me
 ve mujhe kol par avyavhaarik baaten bolte the
 Besides, they used to doubt me that i had an affair with anyone else
 is baat ko lekar ve mujh par kai baat haath uthaa chuke hai

 ek vidhwaa se rape ke aaropee vyakti ko bari karte hue dilli ke ek court ne poocha ki kya rape ke aarope se bari hue vyakti ko 'rape peedit' ke rup main dekha janaa chahie? adishnal seshan jaj ne haryana nivasee rape aaropee ko reeha karte hue yah baat kahi
 Actually, the woman who accused the rape turned away from her complaint
 jaj nivedita anil sharma ne kaha, 'aajkal har jagah janata main is baat ko lekar aakrosh he ki court rape ke aropiyon ko doshi nahin tehra rahi hai
 However, no person or accused of rape can be convicted unless the witnesses support the prosecution or provide any concrete evidence, in which case the victim retracted
 'jaj ne kaha ki mukademe kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaaphi samay jail main bitaane vaale aaropee ko peedit kii gavaahi ke baad bizzat bari kiya jaataa he
 The accused did not rape her
 uski sahmati se hi is vyakti ne shaareerik sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Should such a person be addressed as a rape victim? Let us tell you that the court acquitted the accused and considered the statement of the girl
 ladki ne kaha ki usne kuch shubhachintakon kii galat salaah main aakar par aaropee ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai thi
 On March 11, 2015, the woman had stated that the accused had forcibly had physical relations with her

 input- bhashaa Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader LK Advani has asked Congress President Sonia Gandhi to break his silence on the issue of corruption and the government to issue a white paper on the issue of black money before the winter session begins
 jan chetana yatra ke agle charan ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle adwani samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet kar rahe the
 He said, 'the issue of corruption has been discussed in the country for two years in Parliament and outside the Parliament, despite why Congress President Sonia Gandhi has remained silent about it
 desh jaananaa chahta he unka is par kya mat he, or unki kya bhoomika he
 He said, "the country wants to know why the Congress President did not take steps to curb corruption
" main chaahunga ki congress adhyaksh apana maun tyaage'
 Advani lashed out at the central government over the black money issue and said why the government wants to hide the names included in the sealed envelopes presented in the black money case in the court, the government should announce these names
 varisht bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki aakhir jin logon ne galat dhang se paisa videshi bainkon main jamaa karavaaya he, unke naam ujagar karne main sarkaar kyon sankoch kar rahi he
 He said that before the Winter Session of Parliament starts, the government should issue a white paper on the issue of black money so that the country can get the correct information about the efforts made by the government and black money
 purv up pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sarkaar ne kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke liye kya prayaas kiye hai, uske bare main janata or sansad ko bataanaa chahie
 He said that the names which have come out in the case of black money include some names of India as well, the government should make these names public
 adwani ne pradhanmantri doctor manmohan singh ko ab tak kaa sabase kamjor pradhanmantri bataate hue kaha ki arthshaastri desh kaa netritv kar rahe hai or manhagaai ko kaabo main laa nahin sake
 Describing inflation and corruption as linked to each other, he suggested that the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections should be held simultaneously and on a fixed date, which did not affect the development plans
 adwani ne kaha ki pradhanmantri swayan bhi jaanate hai ki bhrashtachar ko lekar yah pehali sarkaar he jiske kai mantri jail main gayi hai yaa hathaaye gayi hai
 He said that the Prime Minister should have done this work but the court did it
 adwani ne khud ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye prastut kiye jane ko lekar puche gayi prashn ko taalte hue kaha, 'jab chunaav aata he to party tay karti he, isamen koi samasya nahin he
 In response to another question, he said that the decision to divide Uttar Pradesh into four parts should be taken very carefully, many people have committed suicide on this issue in Telangana
 unhone laapata nurse prakaran main rajasthan ke bakhrast mantri mahipal maderna kii saarvajanik hui sidi ke bare main puche gayi prashn kaa jawaab nahin diya lekin purv up pradhanmantri ne kaha ki rajasthan main jo kuch chal rahaa he vah durbhagyapurna he
 Former Union Minister and convener of Jan Chetna Yatra, Ravi Prasad, Bharatiya Janata Party State President Dr
 Arun Chaturvedi, former Chief Minister Vansudhara Raje, MP Om Prakash Mathur and senior officials were present on the occasion
 samaajawaadee party ne congress netaa or mantri benny prasad verma ko dimagi rup se kamjor qaraar dete hue kaha he ki centre sarkaar ko unhen rajya sarkaar ke supurd kar dena chahie, taaki unki dimagi beemaari kaa ilaaj karavaaya ja sake
 The SP was reacting to Beni's statement in which the minister pulled up his own party, claiming that some leaders were acting like the sp's b team
 benny kaa kahana tha ki pichley 20 saal se soobe main congress ko congressi haraate rahe hai
 He alleged that the Congress leader took 5 crore rupees from the SP to get his son defeated
 benny ne rahul gandhi kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki alaakaman ko sab bataa diya gaya he or jald hi karrwai hogi
 Read the entire statement of Beni, he always defeats himself
 After the statement of Congress, Beni's SP also became very dangerous
 jubaani tameez bhul tanj bhare jumale uchhaale jane lage
 After the circumambulation of several parties including Congress and BSP, Hardoi leader and MP Naresh Agarwal, who is associated with SP, said that 'beni is mentally ill
 unki umr kaa asar hoga
 We will ask the Center to refer Beni to the state government for treatment
 yahaan agra samet kai jagahon par achche mental aspataal hai
 He will definitely recover, and then Congress will be more useful
 or kam se kam upi main is tarah ke bayaan nahin denge
 On the other hand, BJP seized this opportunity and reiterated its allegation that there is a monopoly of tickets in Congress with money
 bijepi pravaktaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi bole, ‚Äòpataa nahin unhone kitna paisa lekar tikat liya he
 There are shops selling tickets in Congress
 ab vahi bataaenge kitne main kya bika
 On the other hand, there is a panic in the state Congress after Beni's statement
 rajya congress ke netaa akhilesh pratap singh ke mutabik, ‚Äòhamen vidhansabha chunaavon main sanghathan kamjor hone ke chalate rahul ji ke prachaar kaa laabh nahin mila
 If any senior leader has this kind of information, then he should give information on the party forum so that things can be discussed and action can be taken

 During the promotion of the film, Aajtak's program Sidhi Baat, the three stars talked about their on-screen and off-screen bonding
 jab teenon se poocha gaya ki unke bihaviour main kya samanthaayen hai
 So in response, Dharmendra said that the rites and culture we got from my father, i also gave to my children
 saath hi unhone kaha ki teenon bahut down tu arth hai
 When Sunny and Bobby are asked if they are scared of Papa or not? This person said, i was very scared of my father, even if i have made a mistake and the father does not know about it, i was afraid of what would happen to me if he came to know
 jabakibobine kaha unhen papa se dar nahin lagata
 He was more afraid of his mother
 iske alaava is sawaal par ki teenon main sabase taqatvar koun he jawaab tha dharmendra
 Sunny Deol said father is the most powerful of the three
 saath hi dharmendra ne bataaya ki unako ye personality kudarti mili he
 Earlier he was compared to the great wrestler Dara Singh

 They sit on the edge and say don't make me do anything

 In acting, on one hand, Dharmendra considers Dilipasaheb as his ideal, on the other hand, both his sons consider their father as their ideal

 bhartiya cricket team (indian Cricket Team) ke purv captain saurav ganguli (sourav Ganguly) ravivaar ko shaktishaalee bhartiya cricket niyantran board, yani BCCI ke adhyaksh ban gaye
 Now, Saurav Ganguly will run cricket in India, it is also a political bet, which has been designed by the National President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who has given the Sourav Ganguly (trinamool Congress) , Ie TMC chief and the second consecutive Chief Minister of West Bengal), wants to present Mamata Banerjee as a challenger
 amit shah ne pichley saptaah dilli sthit apane awaas main saurav ke saath ek sankshipt mulaakaat kii thi
 Shortly thereafter, he called his troubleshooter, Sankatmochan Assam leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, and asked him to go to Mumbai
 pashchim bengal kii jang main 'dada banaam didi' kii apni ranneeti kii kamyaabi ko lekar amit shah puri tarah aashwast hai
 After this Himant Biswa Sarma talked a lot on the phone till late Sunday night, and made sure that all the remaining candidates from the bcci's 'election' withdrew
 amit shah ke putr jai shah BCCI ke sachiv ban gaye, or arun dhumal cricket sanstha ke koshadhyaksh
 Arun is actually the younger brother of current Union Minister Anurag Thakur, who was the top official of the BCCI
 bhartiya cricket par ab ek tarah se puri tarah BJP kaa kabza ho chukaa he
 Assembly elections in West Bengal are now scheduled to be held in 2021 (west Bengal Assembly Elections 2021), and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) President Sourav Ganguly has been abstaining from opening his cards till now, and he has called the Narendra Modi government (narendra Modi Government) ) Has supported only the 'swachh Bharat' campaign, whose support could not be avoided
 saurav ne bhi pichley saptaah amit shah se mulaakaat kii baat to kabool kii, lekin koi bhi rajnautik mahatvakanksha hone se inkaar kiya
 The interesting fact is that Sourav Ganguly's tenure at the top of the BCCI will be just 10 months (after that Sourav will have to spend essentially a three-year 'cooling off' period, as per the rules, only six consecutive years in cricket-related administrative posts ), Which will be the perfect time to start a new innings by joining the campaign for the West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021
 maine is kollam ke liye BJP ke varisht netaaon se baat kii, or un sabhi ne ek swar main kaha ki samprati pashchim bengal main sirf 'eks-factor vaale chehre' kii hi kami he
 The current state head of the BJP, Mukul Roy, who broke away from Mamata Banerjee's own party in 2017, has tirelessly established the BJP in the state, and has brought many faces from his old party to the BJP
 He has also brought, but he does not have the weight and charisma, due to which he can meet his old boss
 iske alaava mukul roy bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kaa bhi saamana kar rahe hai, or haal hi main unhen pravartan nideshaalay (ED) ne saman bhi kiya tha
 BJP leaders believe that even though Mukul Roy may not be very happy with this latest bet by Amit Shah, he has no option but to support the scheme
 BJP ne isi saal hue loksabhaa chunaav main pashchim bengal main bahut laabh arjeet kiya, or varsh 2014 main sirf do siten jeetne vaali party ne is baar 18 siton par jeet hasil kii
 Amit Shah also repeatedly visited his land to challenge Mamta Banerjee
 BJP ke ek varisht netaa ne mujhase kaha, "(amit) shah ne tay kar rakhaa tha ki mamata banerjee ke durg ko dhwast karnaa he
 
 
 When he used to tell us that BJP will win, we did not believe him, but the result was shocking
 
 
 ab jab vah kerala or tamilnadu ke liye apni yojanaon kaa zikr karte hai, jahaan BJP kaa astitv tak nahin he, to ham bahut dhyaan se unki baat sunate hai
 
 
 "as cricket continues to be a passion all over the country, Sourav Ganguly and his team will be closely monitored, and if Sourav is able to deliver an effective and clean administration in the BCCI, his credibility will increase
 BCCI ne hameshaa se paardarshita ko rokane kii koshish kii he, so, ganguli kaa akalan isi aadhaar par hoga ki vah sthiti badal paati he yaa nahin
 Abhinav Bindra, who won the only gold medal in the individual Olympic Games for India, has advised Sourav Ganguly in a very strong words, "the Indian cricket team has no traveling doctor
 
 
 ise thik kiya janaa chahie
 
 
 Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri are not medical specialists
 
 
 BCCI ko cricket ko bhi olympics kii tarah vaishvik swaroop dene kii zarurat he
 
 
 The BCCI always stopped it because they do not want to lose control

 Has the Uttar Pradesh government surrendered to the culprits? Responding to Priyanka's tweet, the Uttar Pradesh police posted crime statistics claiming that there had been a reduction in criminal incidents

 Never before in history have leaders been considered so hay, nor have they ever had to face so much pressure and anger of the public
 hamale kaa nishaanaa baniin or kshatigrast hui imaaraton se uthta dhuaan abhi chanta bhi nahin tha ki netaaon ke khilaaf aakrosh kaa visphot hota najar aayaa
 The leader should not only be hostile to the relatives of the victims of the attacks, there was widespread hatred and resentment towards him nationwide
 beshak, is nafrat kii aag itani gahari or itani vyapak thi ki partiyaan or netaa apane jokhim par hi saarvajanik sthanon par gaye
 Even when Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi reached Mumbai during the campaign to take a tough stance towards terrorism, he had to move back immediately when the chief of the anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) of Maharashtra, which was targeted by terrorists, fired
 Hemant Karkare's widow turned down Modi's offer of financial support
 philhal vakt kii jarurat aatankwaad virdohi kade niyamon par rajnatik sarvasammati taiyaar karne or rajya tathaa centre str par aatankwaad se ladane ke liye mashinari kii sthapana karne kii he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should have convened an all-party meeting to deliberate more closely on how to deal with terrorism, but the leaders provoked public anger by his insensitivity and foolish interpretation of public sentiments
 bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne bayaan de daalaa ki ''kuch mahilaayein lipstick or powder lagaakar or purush suut or ti main sajkar sadakon par utar aati hai or netaaon ke khilaaf avishvaas failaati hai'', to kerala ke mukhyamantri ve

" beshak iskaa sabase zyada asar to maharashtra ke sattarudh gathbandhan par hi padana tha, jahaan kuch netaaon par gaaj girani lajimi thi

 patil ne aatankwaadi hamalon ko ''bade shaharon main aisi ghatnaayen ho jaati hai,'' kah kar khud ko sabake uphaas or aakrosh kaa paatr banaaya, to mukhyamantri vilasarav deshmukh ne bhi aatankwaadiyon ko taj se nikaale jane ke baad film nirmaataa ramgopal verma or apane abhinayta bete ritesh deshmukh ke saath taj hotel kaa daura kar apana ahit hi kiya
 After Patil was removed from the post by the NCP, the pressure on the Congress to place someone else in place of Deshmukh started increasing
 apni naak bachaane ke liye deshmukh ne daawa kiya ki unhone bahut pehle hi, kendriya grih mantri shivaraj patil ke saath congress kaarysmiti (seedblusi) kii baithak main istipha de diya tha
 Despite this, the party took four days to accept the resignation
 deree kii vajah vahi thi jo congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bataai gai thi, jab ve dilli hamalon ke baad grih mantri shivaraj patil kaa istipha chaah rahi thim- yani unki jagah duusare netaa ko laae jane par party main sarvasammati na ho paanaa
 Even in such a critical time of crisis, petty political triumphs were in full swing
 jis furti se party ne centre main karrwai kii, yah uske ekadam vipareet tha
 And the full credit for this goes to the mention of Sonia Gandhi and indirectly her children, even her late mother-in-law Indira Gandhi
 seedblusi kii baithak ke shuru main sarvaadhik charchit mudda tha priyanka gandhi wadra kii tippanee, jisamen unhone aatankwaad ke khilaaf apni daadi indira gandhi ke ''majboot or nirnaayak shashan'' ko yaad kiya
 Soon after, Sonia Gandhi announced with a hard face, "the time has passed for resolutions and resolutions
 ab samay nirnaayak karrwai karne or desh ko drudh netritv dene kaa he
 ‚Äúit was too late, the time of sacrifice, and the first name of it was that of Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil, during whose tenure, the most horrific terrorist attacks in the history of India and which he faced most ineffectually
 mumbai jal rahi thi or ve istipha dene main hill-huzzat kar rahe the
 But the Congress president, who had been awake for the last two nights seeing the devastation of Mumbai, was not in a mood to forgive him
 sonia seedblusi ke mood ko hi parilakshith kar rahi thim, jisane do maangen rakhi thim- isaki jimmedaari lenaa or pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai karnaa
 Rahul Gandhi, known for not saying anything in such meetings, used to say, "someone entered our house, slapped us, what would be more embarrassing than this?" Obviously, the only option was to take decisive action now

 But Lalu Prasad Yadav, who is generally in support, said that is it not a very small step taken too late? If the Congress wants to restore its credibility before the general elections, it will have to do a lot
 lekin ugr rashtrawaad kuch is kadar tari tha ki kuch sadasyon ne to pakistan ke khilaaf sainya karrwai kaa bhi suzav de diya
 The fight against terrorism, and especially action against Pakistan, has now firmly occupied the Congress agenda
 yahi vajah he ki videsh mantri pranab mukherjee ko grih mantralay kyon nahin saunpa gaya
 In his place, Dr
 karn singh ko laane kaa suzav bhi diya gaya tha
 Manmohan Singh took charge of the ministry he once handled with great efficiency, ie the Finance Ministry
 ek congressi netaa kaa kahana tha, ''pehle hamane keemten badhane or aatankwaad par naaraazgi jheli thi, ab pradhanmantri ke arthvyavastha sanbhaalane or chidambaram ke grih mantralay kaa mukhiya banane se ham donon hi morchon par jeetenge
 But at the moment, she was absent from the party headquarters with the zeal and enthusiasm with which she contested the assembly elections in early November
 us samay party ko dilli, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main jeet kaa puraa bharosa tha
 But after the Mumbai blasts it simply hopes to win in Rajasthan
 april kii jagah farvari main chunaav karaane kii charchaa ab nahin ho rahi
 The party needs time to do something concrete on issues of economy and security
 pradhanmantri ne america ke saath parmaanu qaraar par jo kuch arjeet kiya tha, ek hi jatke main ganvaa diya
 Even before the Mumbai blasts, the Congress had doubts about the electoral benefits of the deal
 rahul gandhi ke alaava kisi or netaa ne vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan yah mudda nahin uthaaya
 But the employment guarantee scheme and the loan waiver scheme for farmers were very effective
 to ummid karen ki congress parmaanu qaraar kii jagah is par apana abhiyaan adhik kendrit karegi
 And also on anti-pakistan rhetoric
 congress bhale hi samasyaon se ghiri he, lekin vipaksh bhi apni pratishtha bachaa nahin paaya he
 The party faced severe criticism over Naqvi's statement even the BJP had to disassociate itself from this statement
 party mahasachiv arun jetali kaa kahana tha, ''yadi aap kisi mudde par asahmati dikhaa rahe hai to bhi bhashaa to shaleen honi hi chahie
 Naqvi's statement was beyond that
 ''yah rajnatik kshati shikhar tak pahunch gai
 Both Leader of the Opposition LK Advani and the Prime Minister missed the opportunity to rise from politics to become a national leader when they could not even demonstrate political unity
 yah kshubdh karne vaala ghatnakram tha, jiske chalate donon netaa aatankwaad se dahale shahar kaa ek saath daura nahin kar paae
 On 26 November, when Advani went to Manmohan Singh and assured him of the bjp's assurances in times of crisis, the Prime Minister made a proposal to move to Mumbai the next day
 apni patni ke janmdin kaa samaaroh radd chuke adwani iske liye taiyaar ho gaye
 The next day he received a message from the Center that it would be better to visit another day as the operation to combat the terrorists is not yet complete
 vidhansabha chunaav kaa saamana karne ja rahe rajasthan main saarvajanik sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe adwani apane kaarykram main parivartan kar akele mumbai nahin ja sakate the
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leaders advised Manmohan Singh to go to Mumbai on the same day so that the BJP leaders do not win over them in this matter
 lihaaja, pradhanmantri sonia gandhi ke saath mumbai gaye
 Advani also offered to accompany him there, but he was not accepted

 Now his closest friend China has also decided to leave him
 bricks ghoshnaa patr main pakistani aatankiyon kaa naam shaamil kiya gaya, jiskaa china samet sabhi sadsy deshon ko samarthan karnaa padaa
 It said that those who carry out terrorist activities, organize and support terrorism should be held responsible for this
 aatankwaad se ladanaa kisi bhi raashtra kaa ahm kartavya he
 However, Pakistan clarified that there is no safe haven for terrorists on its soil
 is ghoshnaa patr se pakistan buree tarah tilamilaayaa hua he, jabaki is ghoshnaa patr main sidhe taur par uskaa naam nahin shaamil kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, it is natural to ask why Pakistan is so badly stung by the BRICS declaration against terrorism? It is clear from his anger that Pakistan believes that the BRICS declaration is against him
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan ne is ghoshnaa patr ko khaarij kiya he
 It is known that on both days of the BRICS summit held in China, PM Modi raised the issue of terrorism, whereas before the summit started, China had said that there would be no mention of Pakistan sponsored terrorism, but PM Modi did not have a single issue with China
 ghoshnaa patr main kaha gaya ki aatankwadako rokane or iske khilaaf ladaai main raashtra ko ahm bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 It was also emphasized that for this, international cooperation needs to be developed according to the principles of international law

 Despite poor performance, students took expensive loans for admission here
 ek puri peedi taiyaar ho gai jo mahange collejon se padhakar nikali thi, magar berojgaare gale lag gai

 This example can work in the context of India
 thik he ki chunaavon main in muddon par charchaa nahin hoti he or na hi shiksha ke sawaal par koi chunaav harata he,lekin aisi jaankaree par nazar rakhni chahie
 Public pressure can be made in front of the government coming after the elections that loot should be stopped in the name of private college and the government should spend
 beshak chaatr kuch adhik fees sarkari santhaan ko de den magar privet sansthaanon main lut kii samiksha honi chahie
 It should be seen whether employment is being provided in proportion to the expensive fees being paid
 bharat main privet medical college karodon kii fees lekar medical chaatro ko gulam se bhi badtar bana rahe hai
 They are being forced to enslave pharmaceutical companies
 varna emdi kii padhai kii fees nahin de paaenge

 Engineering colleges have sought permission from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to close more than 1 lakh 30 thousand seats
 494 kalejon ne apane course band kar dene kii anumati maangi he
 How many students took admission in these poor engineering colleges by taking loans and got nothing in the name of jobs
 kya yahi shiksha hamaare yuva usase aadhi keemat par hasil nahin kar sakate the? isliye apane aas-paas ho rahi ghatnaon par nazar rakhie
 This election is ruined
 pichley har chunaavon kii tarah
 But see if you have benefited by ruining colleges in village towns
 aapaki shiksha kaa bajet badha he
 The system of government schools and colleges has to be strengthened
 phir se khadaa karnaa hoga, varanaa garib or saadhaaran pariwaron ke log acchhee shiksha se vanchit honge
 Private schools and colleges are a den of loot
 manamaani fees ke khilaaf nakli andolan se kuch nahin hoga
 Even if the media does not cover and cover, nothing will happen
 hamane skulon par 15 episod or collejon par anginat episod kiye hai,media gharaanon ke apane privet skool or college khul gaye hai
 The leaders' money is invested in schools
 privet shiksha unki daulat ko dugani tiguni karne main lagi he
 You are being a pauper 80 fisadi se adhik privet santhaan sapana dikhaate hai or aap laalach main padakar lone le baithte hai
 When we go in, it is revealed that there is neither a qualified teacher nor the whole system of reading
 apane saath hue in haadason ko ab saajha kiijie
 Create a new debate for the next five years
 shiksha kii quality mangiye
 Ask for a good education
 media se nahin, sarkaar se
 Ask yourself kisi bhi chunaav yaa is chunaav main, chunaav ke pehle yaa chunaav ke baad kya aap shiksha ko lekar bahes karte hai, sochate hai, iske aadhaar par kisi netaa kaa moolyankan karte hai?

 a top defense expert has predicted that China may attack India by 2012 to divert its attention from internal dissatisfaction, rising unemployment and financial problems
 unka maananaa he ki ye samasyaayein us desh par communiston kii pakad ko khatra paidaa kar rahi hai
 Bharat Verma, editor of 'indian Defense Review' has said that before 2012 China will attack India
 niraash peiping ke liye bharat kiantim sabak sikhaane ke kai kaaran hai jiske jariye vah asia main is sadi main china kii sarvocchata sunishchit karnaa chahega
 He said that the recession has led to the closure of export shops, causing internal social unrest which is posing a serious threat to the communists' grip on society
 verma ne sampadakeey main kaha he ki is aankalan ke anya kaarnon main badhati berogari, arabon dollar mulya kii puunji udan chhu hone, iske videshi mudra bhandar main kami or badhata aantarik asantosh he
 He said that in addition to this, the increasing irrelevance of Pakistan on his right hand, working against India at the instigation of China, is increasing China's restlessness
 unhone kaha ki america raashtrapati barah obama kii afgaan-paak niti mulat: paak-afgaan niti he jisane badi chaturaai se chor ke peeche chor laga diya he
 Verma said that Pakistan has already been shaken by its proximity to Beijing, which is truly implicated in civil war and is losing importance against India
 unhone kaha ki sabase khaas baat yah he ki america or pashchim ke saath bharat ke badhate talmail se chintit he
 He said that all these concerns of the Chinese Communists are resolved by the war against pacifist India in order to fulfill the multi-pronged strategic objectives

 bhartiya telecom regulator (TRAI) ne bharat main sabhi smartphone main du note disturb ap ko anivaary karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Android already has such a feature, but Apple has not done so yet
 yujar privesi ko lekar aipal apni sakhti ke liye duniya bhar main janaa jaataa he
 There have been many instances when the company has refused to accept anything from the US government to the FBI
 iske peeche company kii daleel yujar kii privesi hi rahi he
 Following this directive issued by TRAI, Apple can now go to court against this new rule of TRAI
 TRAI ke is niyam ke tahat agar kisi company ne apane smartphone main du note disturb ap nahin daalaa to use band kara diya jayega
 ET said in a report quoting sources that this rule brought by Apple-based TRAI is not within its scope and Apple can take legal recourse for it
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki TRAI kanoonee tareeke se kisi telecom company ko kisi handset kii sarvice band karne ko nahin kah sakati he
 However, the next version of Apple ios, ios 12 software update, is expected to provide such a feature so that users can report unwanted calls and messages
 aipal ne TRAI ko iske bare main jaankaree di he or yah sitambar tak sabhi yogya iphone main diya jayega
 Due to this rule of TRAI, news has started coming that millions of iphones can be shut down
 kyonki philhal TRAI ke is niyam par aipal ne hami nahin bhari he
 What is trai's DND app? Indian Telecom Regulator i
e
 TRAI has brought a new version of DND
 regaulator kaa kahana he ki yah ap intellegent feechar ke saath banaaya gaya he or isamen esemas ke liye intelligence spam ditection diya gaya he
 Under this, users can report unwanted calls and messages so that this does not happen later
 yah ap 10MB kaa he or iske dwaara kol ko lekar kiye gaye shikaayat kaa states trek kiya ja saktaa he
 Since this app is connected to calling and messages, this app needs access from call logs and messages to entire contacts
 aipal kyon is ap ko aapke iphone par install nahin karana chahta?yujar kii niztaa yani privesi ko lekar aipal hameshaa se sakht he
 Apple fought a long battle with the FBI to unlock the iphone of San Bernadino's shooter in the US, and ultimately Apple did not unlock the iphone
 aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan aipal yujar kii privesi ko lekar sakhti dikhaa chukaa he
 To install this app of TRAI, the user has to give many types of permissions
 yah ap aapke kol log ko acces kar saktaa he, esemes or contacts ko trek kar saktaa he, massej pard saktaa he
 Generally such apps work on Android, but Apple does not allow such apps in its iphone
 kya hai opshans?aipal ne kaha he, ‚Äòios 12 ke aane ke baad yugers anachaahe esemas massej or colls ko report karne ke liye settings main ja kar anwonted communication extansion aneble kar sakate hai
 Users can enable only one unvoted communication app once
 colls ko report karne ke liye yugers ko left swip karnaa hoga or report karnaa hoga
 There will be a report feature for sms that can complain about unwanted messages' Now it will be interesting to see if TRAI makes any changes in its rules after this answer from Apple or will the iphone be discontinued

 fasebuk post ke mutabik, ritred iees adhikari shivendra ke sinha ko safar ke dauraan pentry waiter ne vegeterian khaanaa 90 rupee lekar sarv kiya
 After investigating this price, Shivendra found that he was given food at more than the IRCTC fixed price list
 iarsitisi ke rate card ke mutabik train main vegeterian khaanaa 30 rupee (tex alag se) or maansaahaari khaanaa 35 rupee (tex alag se) main bechaa janaa chahie
 So, it immediately becomes a scam as soon as the pantry employee served food in the train at a price higher than the fixed price
 vah vegitarian khaanaa jise 50 rupee par bechaa janaa chahie tha 90 rupee main bechaa gaya
 On the other hand, non-vegetarian food which should be sold for Rs 55 is sold for Rs 100
 baharhaal, safar ke dauraan ritred adhikari ne pentry karmchaaree se khaanaa kharidne ke liye mahaj 50 rupee adaa kiye
 But when the Pantry employee asked for the additional money from the said officer, the officer asked to bring the rate list
 pentry kii taraf se ritred adhikari ko rate list nahin uplabdh karai gai
 After the scam broke, though the police staff agreed to give food to that officer for 50 rupees, but also appealed that it should not be mentioned to anyone else
 is apil ke baad ritred adhikari chup nahin hua or pentry ke incharge se milane ke liye pentry car pahunch gaya
 The said retired officer in the pantry car wrote in the complaint register that he was asked for a higher price for food
 lekin ritred adhikari kaa is ghotaale ke suspence kii parten yaheen nahin khatm hui
 The Pantry Incharge filed under the complaint that only 50 rupees were taken from the said passenger and it is the habit of that passenger to file a complaint every time he travels

 raashtrapati kaa sansand ke donon sadanon main bhaashan darasal sarkaar kii pehali nitigat ghoshnaa hogi
 This address will be in the first week of June as the Lok Sabha should be constituted by June 1st
 uske do-teen dinon ke baad yah abhibhaashan hota he
 In 2009 it was read on 4 June
 sutron ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki yah taiyaari pehle se isliye kii jaati he ki nai sarkaar ke aa jane ke baad sab kuch aasaani se ho
 This type of arrangement is being done so that the work of the new government is not stopped
 pradhanmantri ke pradhan sachiv pulak chatarji ne haal hi main yah chitthee bheji he
 But there is a problem here
 vah yah ki bhaashan ke liye saamagree dene main har mantralay apane kaaryon or uplabdhiyon kaa gungan karnaa chahta he
 Apart from this, he writes about the current policies of the government
 ab agar sarkaar badal gai to phir sab kuch nayaa karnaa padegaa
 It is said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked his office to keep all kinds of materials ready
 isamen kai samvedansheel mudde bhi shaamil hai
 It is not possible to keep them separate
 pradhanmantri ne apane pradhan sachiv or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar se bhi kaha he ki ve nae pradhanmantri ko kam se kam samay main dastavej or suchanaaen muhaiyaa karaaen
 Work has started on this
 agar ateet vibhaajankaree tha to is faisle ne bharat ke liye ek nae drushtikon kaa maarg prashast kiya he jisamen desh ke yuvaaon kii apekshaaon ko bhi mahasoos kiya gaya he
 The best thing is that neither side will have to be too much disappointed by this decision
 yah ek bahut hi santulit faisla he jisamen manovigyaan ne bhi ahm yogadan diya isamen koi atishyokti nahin he
 Since this decision has not fully supported any one party, it is also not a decision in its own right
 ek tarah kii swabhaavik shanti, or kahin se kisi tarah ke apriy samachar ke na milane se sabit ho gaya ki 1992 ke baad se bharat main yuvaaon kii ek aisi peedi aa chuki he jo mukt arthvyavastha ke maahaul main paley bade hai or desh main badhate rojgaar ke avasaron ko dekhte hai tathaa jinhen sensex ke utaar chadhaav se jyaad matlab he
 It seems that these people have no meaning that a Ram temple should be built in place of Babri Masjid
 aise yuva ab aise aprasangik itihaas se khud ko judaa mahasoos nahin karte
 But the court decision of 30 September 2010 proved that as a democracy, a society, we have made so much progress that now such cases cannot deter us
 is faisle ke baad yah bhi sabit ho gaya ki hamaara desh puraani baton ko bhuulakar dukandeshi ke saath lagaataar tarakkee ke path par aage badhata rahegaa

 kya aapke pati bhi der raat ghar lautate hai? kya unki is aadat kii vajah se aap pareshaan rahane lagi hai? kya aapako apana parivaar bikharata hua najar aa rahaa he? zyaadaatar auraton ko ye shikaayat hoti he ki unke pati der se ghar lautate hai, jisaki vajah se unke bich aksar ladaai ho jaati he
 Sometimes women feel that their husbands are ignoring them
 yaa phir unka kisi or ke saath
 
 
 But every time the suspicion is correct, it is not necessary aise main acha yahi hoga ki aap donon aamane-saamne baithkar baat karen
 Talking is also important because only by talking can you understand each other's side
 agar aapke pati bhi der se aate hai ghar, to aajamaayen ye tips1
 It is important to know the exact reason
 If your partner comes late every day, then be patient instead of talking to him
 unhen change karne den or jab wo rilax najar aaen to unase unke rojaanaa der se aane kaa kaaran puuchhen
 You will also be able to breathe peacefully after knowing the exact reason
 agar wo kahen ki kuch hi dinon kii baat he kyonki offis main kaam bad gaya he to, ye aapaki jimmedaari he ki aap thodaa practical bane
 2
 apni baat ko sahi tareeke se rakhelpani baat ko sahi tareeke se rakhana aana ek bahut badi kala he
 Many times we even ask the right questions in such a way that the front person feels bad
 aise main apni baat ko or apane sawaalon ko sahi tareeke se rakhen
 If your husband comes late to friends, then explain to him that this is not a good habit
 iskaa asar sehat par to padegaa hi saath hi bacchon ke vikaas par bhi hoga
 3
 ghar kii bhi hai jimmedaariangar aapke partner roj let aate hai to unhenunki gharelu jimmedaariyon ke bare main bataaen
 Both of you have household responsibilities
 koi ek is jimmedaari ko akele uthaae ye sahi nahin he
 4
 sabak sikhaanaa bhi jaruriagar aapke baar-baar kehane ke baavjood yaa phir samajhane ke baad bhi aapkaa partner apni is aadat ko chhod nahin rahaa he to use sabak sikhaanaa jaruri he
 Which method you will try to teach a lesson depends on you
 diggaj rangamanch, tivi va malayalam film kalakaar kalasla babu kaa somvaar tadake yahaan kerala ke ek nijee aspataal main nidhan ho gaya
 He was 68
 paariwarik sutron ne yah jaankaree di

 Ravindra Kumar Pathak, born on 16 September 1974, studied at Kashi Hindu University and researched the topic of "critical adherence to the major grammar of Hindi"
 radhakrishna prakaashan ne unki diary 'jansankhya samasya' prakashit kii he
 In this book, the author is responsible for the historical-cultural-social processes of female desolation behind the population explosion, which by snatching her 'body', cursed her to become a domestic-sick machine of reproduction
 yah prakriya pitrusattatmak he, at: janansakhya-vimarsh kaa yah nayaa rasta pitrusatta ke charitra kaa pardaafash bhi he jo stri kii bahuvidh vanchanaaon-gulaamiyon va pidaaon kaa mul strot he
 Marriage and prostitution
 uske do haath hai, jinase stri ko jakadakar, vah use ‚Äòvyakti‚Äô se ‚Äòdeh‚Äô main tabdeel kar detii he
 Which creates a compulsion of reproduction through her sexual exploitation
 jiskaa khamiyaja stri apana saamaajik jivan, karier, sammaan aadi ganvaakar hi nahin, balki swasthya or astitv tak ko ganvaakar bhugatti he
 a woman is not made a mother, she is made, because there is a difference between mother-ability and the desire to become a mother
 prachlit aarthik drushti se kiye ja rahe jansankhya-vimarsh se alag, yah kriti us vimarsh kii pitrupaksheeya simaaon ko bakhubi ujagar karti he
 Book excerpt: The population problem-population problem has not been discussed so far from a holistic perspective
 meraa maananaa he ki iskaa ek puraa aitihaasik-samajashastreey-saanskrithik-aarthik-manovaigyanik va jeevvaigyanik vimarsh ho jaae
 So, a complete reading of the problems of women is prepared
 iskaa taatpary yah nahin ki vimarsh is raste se karnaa hoga ki janani banakar nari ne hi purush ko janm diya or usee kii rachana purush ne apane varchasv kii saamaajik-aarthik va saanskrithik sanrachana banaakar,phir vaicharik dhaancha banaakar us visham sanrachana ko sthayitv pradaan kar apni janmdatri maa, stri ko har prakaar kii pidaa main daal diya he,jaisaa ki sahir ludhiaanvi ne mahasoos kiya he-‚Äò‚Äòaurat ne janam diya mardon ko,mardon ne use bazaar diya
 When i wanted to raise the issue, when i wanted to abuse ‚Äô‚Äôpar,nahin
 We do not need to think through this philosophical path
 yadhyapi yah rasta darshanik he bhi nahin,thos yatharth par aadhaarit he
 Nevertheless, without getting entangled in this thread line, we can also directly find that a thorough analysis of the population problem is actually to enter into the problematic world of the woman
 phir bina is samasya ko hal kiye stri kii samasyaon kaa na yatharth hal ho sakegaa,na vah sampoorn manushya hi ban sakegi
 We have also seen the picture of this intent in the analyzes so far
 ham ekadam aadi yug main jaakar dekhen to paaenge ki stri kii kaaryakshmata va chusti-furti purush se kuch bhi kam nahin thi
 It was an era of wild life
 donon ke liye jivan kii chunautiyaan evam us par khatre bhi samaan the or unase nibatane main ve samaan rup se bhagidaar bhi the
 Both were equal partners in food-gathering and hunting, so they were equally respected
 parantu,stri kii hinata yaa gulaami kaa bijaropan hi us kshan hua,jab pehali baar stri garbhvatee hui
 In that era, the relationship of sex and conception was unbreakable
 prakritik prerana yaa deh kii pukaar se nar-nari milte the or yon-sambandh kii gali main ghus jate the
 But, it was to get down in the process that the woman got some bondage - being pregnant
 isse bachane kaa koi upaay bhi to na tha
 Gestational burden Body unformedness and lack of nutrients from the process of pregnancy has made a woman immortal or underdeveloped relative to her normal state and not to the common man
 is alpakaalik alpabalata or janit santaan ke prati hui sahaj mamata evam uske kaaran kiye gaye laalan-paalan main padane se stri kii daihik sambhaavna kuch simit ho gai or iske kaaran purush ke saath kandhe se kandha,kadam se kadam milakar chalane main vah kuch pichad gai
 Women had to go through this process almost every year - because the body-relationship was driven by natural inspiration and there was no science to avoid conception
 duusari baat,shesh pashuon kii tarah garbhaadhan kaa mausam vishesh bhi manushya main na tha
 Was a free license for a year
 sabakaa parinaam yahi hona tha ki aarthik-samjik prakriyaaon main stri bilkul purush ke baraabar apni deh-shakti phir man-shakti se judane se pichhadati rahi
 From the top, she was also fascinated by the security given by the male partner during the pregnancy period
 in sabase,stri ke ablaapan evam uske purush-nirbhar,purush-shasit hone kii vichaardhaara udit hui- jo purush va stri kii buddhi main jad jamaati gai
 As a result of this ideology, the direct conditions of the woman became worse, that is, the capacity left, it also controlled the 'thoughts'
 phir,is badtar sthiti ke sangat stri hinata yaa stri ke doum darje kii praani second sex kii idology or bhi badi
 All in all, two myths or cultural categories called 'masculinity' and 'femininity' - that is, two genders were established
 yah‚Äògender-‚Äôbhed dhire-dhire sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath viksit ho gaya or saamaajik sanrachana,arthvyavastha,kala-saanskrithik va dharmik kshetra hi nahin,jivan ke liye bhautik suvidhaon kaa anveshan karanevaali vigyaan-takneekon tak main chaa gaya
 This distinction made its presence known in all the scriptures and disciplines of knowledge, because even the backward woman was not a participant in the scriptures
 jab jivan ke har aayam main stri purush se hinatar thahar chuki thi
 The 'patriarchy' had emerged as a marriage institution and prostitute system, considering women-body as its fiefdom and using its manpower, fertility and sexuality as its own
 meraa spasht rup se maananaa he ki stri kii deh par purush ke vyaktigat adhikaar kii ichha kaa fal he vivaah-sanstha tathaa us par purushon ke samuhik adhikaar kii ichha kaa fal he veshya tantra
 The only difference is that the other only wants a recreation
 pehali usase riproduction yani santaan-janan aadi bhi chaahati he
 These institutions are the source of all the sufferings of women slaves - these are the main pillars of 'patriarchy'
 isi ne stri kii deh ko kabje main lekar uski samast vaiyaktik sambhaawanaaon chaahe deh ke kshetra main balishtha,khilaadi,sainik aadi banane kii ho yaa man ke kshetra main pratibha ke anant roopon main failane kii ko kuchal diya he
 At the same time, as a means of increasing the population, the idealized by the scriptures 'mother', 'daughter-daughter', 'child ie son is the purpose of marriage' or 'becoming a mother is a woman's debt-salvation' etc
 Made that way too
 is prakaar hamane paaya ki purush sattatmak vichaardhaara va sanrachana ke udai ke peeche kaa pahalu jansankhya samasya he or iske udai kaa hi parinaam he jansankhya vruddhi
 Patriotism is not only a social problem, but also the mother of many social problems
 phir itnaa hi nahin he
 Due to the weakness or social inferiority of women, the development programs are not only unbalanced, but the vehicle of development also slows down
 dow
 Amartya Sen has explained this by doing a very precise analysis
 jansankhya samasya kaa sabase ghaatak parinaam unhone stri kii swatantrata kaa chhin janaa batalaaya he
 Due to which she is deprived of editing many works
 striyon ko lagaataar garbhadhaaran va shishupaalan main padi rahakar swatantra kaaryakshmata to khona hi padataa he,balki kai baar to prasav chakra se unki jindagi bhi gambheer khatre main pad jaati he

 main 34 saal se aisi kisi ghoshnaa kaa intjaar kar rahaa hum kyonki mere jane ke baad se lekar ab tak hamaare paas koi bhi maanav antariksh kaarykram nahin rahaa he
 i am thrilled that it is finally going to happen
 '' kya unhen is baat kaa koi gurej hoga ki unka apana antariksh record jald hi tut jayega? ve chhutate hi kehete hai, "nahin, bilkul nahin, yah record jitani zyada baar toote utani hi khushi hogi
 "(see our first space man) In Bangalore, at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) headquarters and scattered space centers across the country, there was a wave of joy with the Prime Minister's announcement
 2006 se, jab isro ne aupchaarik rup se centre sarkaar ke samaksh ek maanav antariksh mishan kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, tab se hi uske vaigyanik is tarah kii kisi ghoshnaa kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahe the
 ISRO Chairman dr

 sivan kehete hai, "pradhanmantri ne hamen ek bada uphaar diya he
 We have been improving our technology for manned space missions over the years and therefore we are confident that we will be able to do so in the 2022 deadline
 '' pradhanmantri ne ise mishan gaganyan kaa naam diya he or isamen teen bharatiyon ko ek saptaah ke liye prithvi kii kaksha main bhejne kii yojana he
 ISRO will join the troupe of space superpowers by successful manned space missions, which currently includes the space agencies of the US, Russia and China (the newest to join this special club)
 1969 main apni sthapana ke baad isro kaa pradarshan saarvajanik kshetra ke chuninda upakramon jaisaa rahaa he
 Over the following decades, it has mastered the sophisticated and complex rocket and satellite technology required for space-oriented countries
 aaj, ise sabhi mukhya prakaar ke rocket‚Äîthos-eendhan, taral-eendhan yaa cryogenic eendhan vaale rocket‚Äîmain utkrushtataa hasil he
 It has also produced some of the world's heaviest launch vehicles
 yah sanchaar, mausam vigyaan, nevigation or sainya jaruraton samet kai anya prakaar ke kaaryon ke liye atyaadhunik or bharat main nirmit bhartiya upgrarhon ko kaksha main sthapit karne jaisi shandaar uplabdhiyon par itaraa bhi saktaa he
 In recent years, it has entered the field of space exploration by sending unmanned spacecraft to orbit the Moon and Mars
 mangal par to ise apane pehle hi prayaas main or sabase kam laagat par antariksh yaan bhejne kaa gaurav praapt he
 The manned space mission is the next ambition of ISRO
 yah maanav antariksh interphes main visheshgyata banane kaa avasar he or ise sabase jatil takneekon main se ek mana jaataa he jisamen dakshata kaa isro ne lakshya rakhaa he
 Sivan believes that it will take Indian science and technological progress to great heights
 unhone india today se kaha, "yah sirf isro kaa project nahin he balki yah ek rashtriya pariyojna he, kyonki isamen hamen kai agenciyon, sansthaanon or sansthaaon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 With their efficiency, ability and strength, we will be able to make this campaign a success
 '' (dekhen baatcheet)phir bhi, maanav antariksh mishan ke liye hari jhandi dikhaane ke peeche sarkaar kii soch or iraade ko lekar bhi kai andeh jataae gaye hai
 Some of them seem appropriate as well
 prakhyat antariksh vaigyanik ve
 Siddharth reportedly told the BBC, "sending Indians into space is a strange and stupid idea, especially 50 years after Neil Armstrong landed on the moon
 '' unka tark haih robotic mishan ab inasaanon ko bhejne main shaamil jokhim ke alaava antariksh main bahut kuch aisa kar sakate hai jo koi antariksh yatri kar saktaa he
 Kiran Karnik, another eminent space and information technology expert, says that politics is more visible in combining this mission with prestige and pride
 unka maananaa he ki maanav antariksh mishan kii tabhi sarthakata he jab makasad vinaashkari jalwaayu parivartan yaa parmaanu yuddh ke kaaran hone vaale vinaash se bachane ke liye yaa phir paryaavaran ke liye hanikaarak udyogon ko chandramaa yaa saura mandal ke anya hisson main sthanantarit karne kii taiyaari kii dirghakaalin yojana ho
 Meanwhile, Kharabapati private investors have also ventured into this sector, which is fading the glow of isro's achievements
 richard branson ke virgin galactic, alan musk ke spesex or jeff bejos ke blue origin ne bahut kam samay main shandaar antariksh kaushal kaa pradarshan kiya he
 spacex has also received an order from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop a capsule in place of the space shuttle to reach the International Space Station
 testla ke siio musk ne mangal grah ke liye maanav mishan bhejne kii apni yojana kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Bezos, the founder of Amazon and now the world's richest person, stated the goal of Blue Origin, stating that his plan is now that "millions of people live in space and work from there"
 '' unki company new shaperd naamak ek rocket taiyaar kar rahi he, jisamen badi-badi khidkiyaan hongi jisase khagol-paryatak shandaar najaara le sakenge
 And Virgin Galactic is close to launching a sub-orbital launcher and will give people a tour of space for a mere $ 250,000
 haalanki, isro ke sivan in nijee udhyamon ke saath bharat ke antariksh mishan kii tulana yaa bharat kii antariksh yojanaon ke aalochakon se naaraaz hai
 They believe that ISRO has already developed a wide range of technology which reduces the cost of manned missions
 is mishan kii laagat kaa vartmaan anumaan 10,000 karod ru
 Is, which is said to be half of the cost of such an enterprise internationally
 america or rus donon kii sarkaron ne manushyon ko antariksh main bhejne kii yojana ko phir se shuru kar diya he or china bhi apni yojanaon ko vistaar de rahaa he
 So it is not that robots will soon completely replace humans
 sivan yah bhi kehete hai ki isro ne bhi apni takanic or prodyogiki se jude bahut se kaamon main dhire-dhire desi nijee udyogon ko lagaaya he
 60 percent of rocket launcher parts are manufactured by private aerospace enterprises and the figure for satellites is up to 50 percent
 unka maananaa he ki maanav antariksh mishan desh ke audyogic vikaas ko badhaava degaa or nai takneekee kranti kaa sutaradhar banegaa jiskaa aage chalakar aam janata ko laabh milegaa
 The important thing is that if there are no state-of-the-art challenges, ISRO scientists will either fall behind or become sluggish in this new round of space races
 ve kehete hai ki maanav mishan hamaare zyada se zyada yuvaaon ko vigyaan kii ore aane ke liye prerit karegaa
 So, what do we need to send our men and women to space? First, it requires a large rocket that can lift a capsule weighing the equivalent of seven maruti-suzuki Ciaz cars
 haal ke varshon main isro ne apane baari lift launture, jeeyo-synchronas satellite launch vaahan (jieselvi) mark 3 ko bahut unnat bana liya he
 But it is designed to place large satellites in orbit
 ab is launture kii reating insaan ke saath bheje jane vaale launture kii shrenee main hogi
 Former ISRO Chairman K
 radhakrishnan bataate hai ki jab aap maanav antariksh udaan kii baat karte hai, to launture kii vishwasaneeyata 98 pratishat yaa usase adhik kii honi chahie
 That is, out of 100 launches, only two failures will be valid
 launture ko puri tarah kaamyaab banane ke liye use apane sabhi mahatvapurn hisson kii prachurtaa main nirmaan ke alaava, isro ko mark 3 launture main bahut se sanshodhan bhi karne honge taaki ise kru modul (aisa modul jisamen chaalak dal ke sadsy bhi hote hai) vaala banaakar isamen insaan ko baithaaya ja sake
 Even the launch pad would have to be modified to make it possible for the astronauts with the spacecraft (who might have got the name of "gagannotes") around
 isro ke liye vishesh rup se mahatvapurn hoga launch phej ke baad kisi bhi apaat sthiti se nipatane kii khatir taiyaar rahane ke liye ek kru escape system viksit karnaa
 After all, the crew would be sitting on over 200 tons of highly flammable fuel at launch; And if any defect occurs, they will need to be removed at a safe distance from lightning speed
 isi saal july main isro ne is tarah kii pranali kaa safaltaapurvak pareekshan kiya jab maanav sahit antariksh orbitor ke baraabar vajan vaale ek capsule ko sriharikota lonchpad par 2
 Was ejected at an altitude of 7 km and then gently lowered using a parachute
 isro ek vishesh sensor bhi viksit kar rahaa he jise rocket control system par lagaaya jayega
 This sensor will give advance warning of any failure and will give the crew module the command to exit the launcher
 is tarah kii pranali kii vishwasaneeyata kaa kadaa pareekshan hona chahie
 Only one launch out of 500 launches should have a high reliability rate like failure
 isro ke liye sabase badi chunauti orbital modul viksit karnaa or un logon ko prashikshan dena hogi jo charam sthitiyon main ise chalaa rahe honge
 The orbital module is divided into two systems: a crew module containing astronauts, and a service module that maintains the speed and orientation of the spacecraft using rocket motors in addition to solar cell-generated power supplies
 chaalak dal ke modul main aantarik vaataavaran ko barkaraar rakhana badi chunauti hogi taaki antariksh main apane ek saptaah ke pravaas ke dauraan, teen antariksh yatriyon ke liye ise aaramdaayak banaaya ja sake
 This would require the temperature to be maintained at 20 degrees centigrade, even if the outside temperature was below 60 degrees or even below zero
 iske alaava vayumandaleey dabaav ko bhi niyantrit karnaa hoga kyonki yah prithvi se 400 kimi kii oonchai par kaksha main 7 kimi prati second kii gati se daudta he
 In addition to managing human waste, scientists must also have space in the capsule to store food and water ‚Äî everything floats in zero gravity, so the trouble will be greater
 pehali udaan ke liye, bharat roosi yaa america antariksh agenciyon se sahaayta le saktaa he jinke paas maanav antariksh udaanon ke prabandhan main visheshgyata he
 On the return trip, the service module in which the motor module resides will be used to slow down the speed of the orbiter
 kru modul se khud ko alag karne se pehle avarohan ke kone ko sahi karnaa hoga
 The most important moment occurs when the crew module re-enters Earth's atmosphere in its return journey
 tab ise lagbhag 1000 degree centegrade yaa steel ke liye pighalkar ubalane jitne ucch taapmaana kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 ISRO scientists carried out a crew module Atmosphere re-entry Experiment (CARE) in December 2014
 kru modul ke vayumandal main punah pravesh ke dauraan antariksh yatri ko shant or surakshit rakhane kii takanic main maharath hasil kii
 a simulated crew module was dispatched using a GSLV rocket and was built to experience both the high temperatures and the force of gravity it would face on its return journey
 isaki sataha par carbon mishrit tiles kii lep chadhaai gai thi jisane ise atyadhik taapmaana kaa saamana karne or bina kisi nuksaan ke bengal kii khadi main ghota lagane main sakasham banaaya
 Space scientists had already completed the capsule recovery experiment in 2007, opening its parachutes that would slow it down to a safe velocity for beach landing
 unhone care prayog main main bhi recovery kshamta kaa pareekshan kiya
 Over the next two years, he worked on upgrading the re-entry and recovery system
 beshak, sabhi ke liye sabase bada kaary hoga un antariksh yatriyon kaa chayan jo kathin paristhitiyon main bhi sthiti ko niyantrit karne kii kshamta rakhte hon or chayan ke baad prashikshan bhi bada kaary he
 Choosing Indian Air Force pilots like Rakesh Sharma is an option
 lekin sivan kehete hai ki isro iske liye vyapak str par talash abhiyaan chalaaegaa
 About 500 candidates will be shortlisted, out of which the number is likely to be limited to 10 members and will be trained
 prashikshan main un gurutv-balon ko sanbhaalanaa sikhaaya jayega jinhen ve launch main or vaapasi yatra main anubhav kar sakate hai or unhen shunya gurutvkarshan sthitiyon main bhi kaam karnaa sikhaaya jayega
 India does not have such rigorous and specialized training facilities, such as centrifuge g-force for training and the facility to tailor aircraft in zero gravity conditions; It will take a few more years to achieve them
 sivan ne sanket diya he ki pehali maanav udaan ke liye, isro apane antariksh yatri ko prashikshit karne ke liye kisi anya desh kii madad le saktaa he
 Now when it comes to food for astronauts, India's defense laboratories prepared food for Sharma's flight
 prayogshaalaayein ek khaas bhartiya swaad ke saath ek behatar menu uplabdh karaane ko taiyaar hai
 The prestige of the country along with human life will be at stake in the mission, so ISRO is working towards making India's first human mission free from all kinds of risk
 ve antariksh main hone vaali maut kii jaankaree se avgat hai
 Even in America, there have been many major accidents in which many astronauts including Kalpana Chawla were killed
 2003 main apni vaapasi yatra par antariksh shatal main visphot ho gaya tha or kalpana samet sabhi chah anya chaalak dal kii jaan chali gai thi
 There will be dress rehearsals before literally sending astronauts into space, with all unmanned missions followed by two unmanned missions to ensure that all preparations are well and that the mission is now ready to take humans along
 disambar 2021 main pehle bhartiya maanav mishan ko launch karne kii yojana he
 "when i saw India for the first time from the orbit of the earth, a good feeling came from all over me
 kuch dinon baad maine antariksh se mahasoos kiya ki koi bhugaulik simaaen hai hi nahin
 The whole earth is one
 ''rakesh sharma,antariksh main jane vaale pehle bhartiya, india today, 30 april, 1984"shunya gurutvkarshan main hone par jo sabase vismayakari chijen maine mahasoos kii hai unamem se ek to yah he ki jab main sona chaahati hum, to mujhe lagata he ki mere paas keval apane vichaaron ke alaava or kuch nahin he jise mahasoos kiya jaae kyonki aap bharahin hote hai, aap apane pair yaa apane sharir ko mahasoos nahin karte
 You can say that you have nothing more to experience in your body besides your thoughts and intelligence
 ''kalpana chawla,divangat america antariksh yatri or antiraksh main jane vaali bhartiya mul kii pehali mahila, india today, 26 janvari, 1998"ek chote-se spescraft main dharti ke chaaron ore chakkar katate vakt, ho saktaa he ki aap jahaan hai or jo kar rahe hai, uskaa utana mol na samaj pate hon jitna samaj paaen

 ''sunita williams,antariksh main record banane vaali america antariksh yatri or bhartiya mul kii mahila, india today, 15 aktubar, 2007 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting will soon take steps to develop the Indian Institute of Mass Communication as a communication university
 santhaan ke 47wein dikshant samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue soochna evam prasaaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne isaki ghoshnaa kii

 jaavdekar ne kaha ki soochna or prasaaran mantralay kii website par iske liye ek sthaan tay kiya jayega, jahaan log apane vichaar or salaah de sakenge
 He said, 'the idea of developing the institute as a communication university is part of the Prime Minister's communication vision

 These people say that there was a lot of excitement about Kapil's show
 so kuch log channel ke brake main bhale hi idhar-udhar chale gaye hon, lekin channel main sho to kapil kaa hi dekha hoga
 Let me tell you that Kapil's show on Colors was such a hit that the sweat of other channels was missed in making the rest of the serial a hit

 On the other hand, people from the other side say that Kapil's show would have been more of a hit
 kyonki kai logon ne bajirao mastaani dekh rakhi hogi
 The film was a big hit
 in logon kaa kahana he ki kapil ke sho ko lekar logon main kaaphi utsaah tha
 So some people may have gone here and there in the break of the channel, but must have seen the show of Kapil in the channel
 bataa den ki kapil kaa colors par sho itnaa hit tha ki baaki serial ko hit karaane main anya channelon ke paseene chhot gaye the
 By the way, some people also say that it can also be a work of PR to call their own channel a hit
 akasar aisa hota he ki piaar vaale apane paksh main khabaron ko failaa dete hai
 Now it is also Chail Sony of Bari Kapil & Company that they come up with the facts

 The AAP government is not in the mood to take a risk regarding votes after the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle aap sarkaar mahilaon ko metro or bason main muft sawari karaane ke liye 1566 karod kharch karne se bhi gurej nahin karnaa chaahati
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself informed the media about the official blue print prepared
 aap sarkaar kii najar is baar mahila voton par he, kyonki dilli main mahilaon kii aabaadi ek bahut bada vot bank he
 In such a situation, the Kejriwal government is trying to capture this vote bank by giving free travel to women
 dilli sarkaar ke mantri is kadam ko janata ke bhale kii raajnneeti bataate hai, to vahiin mantri gopal raay kaa kahana he ki is kadam ko mahila suraksha ke lihaaj se dekha janaa chahie
 AAP, which has gained power by raising the issue of electricity water, is now planning to count this issue in big steps for women by providing free travel facilities
 haalanki, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) is maamle ko puri tarah se raajnneetik kadam bataa rahi he
 BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel attacked the Kejriwal government and said that in four and a half years, the government has failed to fulfill its promises
 isliye logon ko muft revadiyon ko baant janata kaa vot hasil karnaa chaahati he
 Significantly, the Delhi government is at the forefront of giving subsidy where the subsidy of about 1800 crores in electricity and 260 crores in water is already being given, while after this scheme additional burden of subsidy of 1566 crores on Delhi's treasury Will have to
 yahi nahin, finance se jude jaankaar dilli sarkaar ke purv vitt sachiv umesh sahagal kii maane to unka kahana he ki jis tareeke se sarkaar kaa revenue janaret lagbhag 38000 karod he, usamen se sarkaar bijli-pani par sabsidi de hi rahi he
 Along with this, DTC is running in deficit and if there will be free travel with deficit, then obviously, this deficit will increase further
 vahiin, metro par 1566 karod kii sabsidi dene vaali sarkaar par agar mahilaon kaa muft safar hoga, to yah sabsidi lagbhag 22 sau karod pahunch jaaegi
 In such a situation, the government will be seen giving subsidy of about 7 to 8 thousand crores and its burden will be on the tax payers of Delhi itself
 iske saath hi dilli main vikaas kaary bhi rukenge

 In retaliation for the death of their leader Kishenji, the burning Naxalites killed 13 soldiers by blasting a landmine on the bhandariya-bargar road in the forest of Salo in Garhwa district on 21 January

 is ghatana ke baad se naksaliyon ne surakshabalon par hamale tej kar die
 In the recent attack, he not only looted police weapons, but also kidnapped four people including Garhwa District Council President Sushma Mehta and CPI (ML) leader Akhtar Ansari
 jinhen baad main reeha kar diya gaya
 Earlier, on December 3, within 10 days of Kishenji's death, the Maoists injured 11 soldiers of a security convoy of Chatra MP Inder Singh Namdhari from Chatra in Latehar's Garu area
 kishanji ke saath hui suraksha balon kii muthbhed ko farji qaraar dete hue naksaliyon ne 4 or 5 disambar ko bharat band kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Naxalites have become aggressive in boosting the morale of the disintegrating Naxalite cadre due to the access of security forces to the ravines of Saranda, which is considered an impregnable area of naxalites and the arrest of top leaders like Girish Mahato, Narasimha Reddy, Uday

 In such a situation, even if you try to maintain your fear through Naxalite attacks, their morale is definitely dropped
 saranda or jhumara ke baad surakshabalon ne palamu pramandal ke latehar, gadwa jaise ilaakon main bhi dabish tej kar di he
 The strategy of encircling the Naxalites in areas such as Saryu, Kone, Oraiya is enough to dodge them

 We used to go from the way inside the doors, so many large courtyards and verandas were found, the doors of the verandah were open, the street used to be sunny by the end of the day and those trees were surrounded by terraces so that we would climb those trees and get on any roof when we were monkey Even more cat than cat, we were playing electric pole in the streets yesterday

 Water man i also used to think about water, that water will teach us to settle in India, water will be easy, like the light of the sun like the light of Jasapom, will be barely visible in the twilight, and will stray into a country that has to come on the map just now; In the air, it will be filled in a pit of mud till the nameless dome, whenever i feel thirsty, i will be in marriage and It was thought to be in the shadow of a tree growing on a thin and slow side, it would not only work in the body, the night we woke up on the boat, that night, the water just kept coming back to the body? What did we tell when we started writing? i do not know how to do the writing while writing in water
 Water does not do the same as it is asked to do
 Water is used to irrigate a plant

 samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke bare main ye baat is vakt bilkul sach sabit ho rahi he
 Akhilesh Yadav, who came after the results on May 23, could neither hold a review meeting of the defeat nor postmortem the results of the defeat
 ab unke saamne ek or musiibat aa khadi hui he
 The Samajwadi Party has got 5 seats in the Lok Sabha
 azamgarh se akhilesh yadav, mainpuri se mulaayam singh yadav, rampur se ajam khan, muradabad se doctor hasan or sanbhal se shafikurrarahaman bark
 The Lok Sabha session is starting from 17 June
 uske pehle akhilesh yadav ko loksabhaa main sansadeey dal kaa netaa chunanaa hoga
 Mulayam Singh will be made the leader of the parliamentary party but if Akhilesh Yadav becomes the Chief Whip, then it will not be according to his stature and if the father and son both hold the post, then the party will get the wrong message
 doctor hasan pehali baar saansad bane hai or shafikurrahman 92 saal ke hai
 Overall, Azam Khan may have to become the chief whip
 ab mushkil ye he ki mulaayam singh or shafikurrahman bujrg hone ke saath loksabhaa kii kaarywahi main bahut sakriyata se bhaag le nahin sakate
 If Dr
 Hasan wins for the first time, then Akhilesh Yadav himself will have to stay in session to keep the party's favor in the Lok Sabha on every issue
 agar ajam khan ko mauka diya to vartmaan maahaul main unke bhaashan se party ko phayda kii jagah nuksaan hi na uthaanaa pad jaay
 Due to this fear, in the entire Lok Sabha elections, Azam Khan went to promote the party only in Moradabad apart from Rampur
 akhilesh kashmakash main hai
 Wait till June 17 to see how Akhilesh saves his stature among the top leaders of the party in the Lok Sabha

 ' coton kii sari or choti si laal bindi lagaae dimple yadav, sapa kii ek or ummidavaar richaa singh ke liye chunavi abhiyaan kar rahi thim
 Many women were busy listening to his speech, who called him 'dimple Bhabhi'
 gauratlab he ki 2009 main dimple yadav ko raaj babbar ne phirozabad se sansadeey chunaav main haraaya tha
 But after three years, when Akhilesh Yadav resigned as MP from Kannauj seat after becoming Chief Minister, after that Dimple Yadav was elected unopposed from here
 tippaniyan Dimple Yadav is usually seen speaking less, she is known for not asking questions in Parliament, she has participated only twice in Parliament debates and has a record of only 37 per cent of her attendance

 In this World Cup, the Indian team management kept the questioning media away from itself
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf khele gaye world cap ke pehle match se pehle team ne net gendbaajon ko press conference main bheja
 The reasoning behind this was that this is the right time to know his experience with Avesh Khan and Deepak Chahar

 There is no evidence on paper that this was a ploy but the Indian team's stance on keeping distance from the media is not hidden from anyone

 In the middle order of this team, there were two players who did not even have the status of primary player in the team selected for the World Cup

 Shastri had said that the Indian team is the best team
 ab samay aa gaya he ki coach saamne aakar bataaen ki newjiland ke khilaaf team kyon vifal rahi

 With the announcement of Arvind Sawant's resignation, it has been decided that the Shiv Sena is out of the NDA

 haalanki maharashtra main shivasena or ensipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke bhi samarthan jarurat padegi
 But Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has said that the meeting is going to be held at 10 o'clock today and the decision will be taken according to the instructions of the high command
 lekin uske saath hi unhone kaha ki abhi tak kaa jo faisla he ki hamen vipaksh main hi baithna chahie
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 in / cricket ke khel main wicketiper kaa kaam behad thakaa dene vaala hota he
 This fatigue is aggravated when you have to start the innings after wicketkeeping several consecutive overs
 team india ke wicketiper parthiv patel ko england ke khilaaf chennai test main aise hi anubhav se guzarana padaa
 Constant dominating fatigue breaks your entire body and slows down your reflexes and running between the wickets, but Parthiv not only kept his responsibility well and started the Indian innings after wicketkeeping for over 150 overs
 Rather made a half-century
 chennai test main pehle batting ko utari england team kii pari behad lambii khinch gai
 England's innings 157 on the second day of the match
 2 overs ke baad 477 ran par samaapt hui
 The most tiring task in cricket is that of the wicketkeeper
 duusare fielder to is dauraan kuch relex karne kii sthiti main hote hai lekin wicketiper ko har gend par baarik najar jamaakar rakhni hoti he
 As soon as there is a catch or stomping miss on any ball, it is as if all its hard work gets washed away
 tippaniyan Team India's 'chhutke' player performed this responsibility well as a wicketkeeper
 unhone 157
 He did his work with complete vigil behind the wicket for 2 overs and also started batting with Lokesh Rahul due to Murali Vijay's injury
 wicketcaping ke thakaa dene vaale anubhav ke baad yah vaaki prashansa ke laayak kaam tha
 Parthiv was unbeaten on 28 on the second day of the match and Team India's score was 60 runs without losing a wicket

 Parthiv added 152 runs for the first wicket with Lokesh Rahul
 opening partnership haal ke samay main team india ke liye chintaa kaa vishay rahi he or 31 pari ke baad bharat kii ore se test main pehle wicket ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari hui he
 Parthiv was dismissed for 71 shortly before lunch on the third day
 aakarshak pari main unhone 112 gendon kaa saamana kiya or saat chauke lagaae
 In the Chennai Test, the batting of the first English team was dragged very long
 england kii pari match ke duusare din 157
 Finished for 477 runs after 2 overs
 cricket main sabase zyada thakaane vaala kaam wicketiper kaa hi hota he
 Other fielders are in a position to do some relays during this period, but the wicketkeeper has to keep a close eye on every ball
 kisi bhi gend par koi kaich yaa stamping miss hote hi maano uski puri mehnat par pani phir jaataa he
 The comments bataur wicketiper apni is jimmedaari ko team india ke 'chhutke' khilaadi ne bakhubi nibhaayaa
 He 157
 2 over tak wicket ke peeche apana kaam puri chaukasee se kiya or murali vijay ke chotil hone ke kaaran lokesh rahul ke saath ballebaaji kii bhi shuruyaat kii
 It was a work of praise after the tiring experience of wicketkeeping

 The World anti-doping Agency (WADA) has criticized the dissolution of the Union Cyclist Internationale (UCI) into an independent probe committee investigating the case involving Lance Armsstrong and termed it as a 'clever' move by the UCI
 wada ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki usiai ne ek baar phir apni jimmedaariyon kaa nirvahan nahin kiya he or lans se jude maamle kii jaanch kar rahi samiti ko bhang karke bahut galat kaam kiya he
 The comments usiai ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki vah samiti ko isliye bhang kar rahi he kyonki use wada or lans ko pratibandhit dawaaon ke seven kaa doshi qaraar dene vaali america doping nirodhi agency (uasaidie) se kisi prakaar kaa sahyog nahin mil rahaa he
 Instead, UCI has decided to set up a 'truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'
 usiai ne daawa kiya he ki uske is nae kamishan kaa wada pramukh jon phahe kaa samarthan mila hua he
 Wada said on Wednesday that UCI has not discharged its responsibilities once again and has done a lot of wrongdoing by dissolving the committee investigating the case involving Lance
 tippaniyan The UCI said on Tuesday that it was dissolving the committee because it was not receiving any support from the US anti-doping Agency (USADA), which convicted Wada and Lance of consuming banned drugs
 isaki jagah usiai ne 'truth and rikanshiliation kamishan (tiarsi)' gathit karne kaa man banaaya he
 UCI has claimed that this new commission has the support of WADA chief John Fahey

 China and Pakistan are troubled by the growing friendship between India and America
 One thing happened, but what is so special about this friendship is that we are not upset at all
 bharat or america ab maansik or raajnneetik rup se ek-duusare ke kareeb aa chuke hai
 As a precaution, you can say that you have already come very close
 itnaa ki donald trump kaa samarthan karne america or bharat main kuch log binar poster lekar aa gaye
 Whatever it is, India and America are now expressing their love in public
 somvaar ko washington main bharat ke raksha mantri manohar parrikar or america ke raksha mantri eston carter ne ek samjhaute par dastakhat kiye, jise LEMOA kehete hai
 Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
 ab america apane ladaaku vimaanon kii marammat, eendhan kii aapurti ke liye bharat kii madad le sakegaa
 India will also be able to get help from America
 is maukey par jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya he ki yah samjhauta vyaavhaarik aadan-pradaan ke liye atirikt avasaron ko uplabdh karaayega
 This line is very easy to hear, but without detail, you will not know anything from it
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki samjhaute ke kaaran lagistic saport dene ke liye donon main se koi bhi baadhya nahin he
 In each case, both sides will have to take a separate approval
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha he ki bharat or america ke bich logistic ko lekar jo qaraar hua he, usamen sainik adda banane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 This is his statement and not the details of the copy of the agreement has been made public
 sainik adda nahin banaaenge or sainik addon kaa istemaal kiya ja sakegaa donon main bahut antar he
 Both will have their own dangers and threats
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki raksha mantri ne ek amareeki patrkaar ko kaha he ki pehle ve is samjhaute kii detail saarvajanik karenge or dekhenge ki logon kii pratikriya kya he
 We have been partners of America for decades
 kareeb aa hi chuke hai
 But what does it mean to be a partner through these agreements? bas ye google karte rahen ki america kaa partner banakar duniya main koun sa aisa mulk he jo apane ilaake main super power hua he
 For the time being Pakistan is said to be close to America, in this order more countries can be named
 kya china bhi america kaa partner banakar shaktishaalee bana he
 However, India is going to have four basic agreements with the US
 ye chaaron samjhaute donon mulkon kii sainya kshetra main rishtedaari ko mukammal kar denge
 One of these four is LEMOA
 bharat ne chaar main se do par dastakhat kar die hai
 The first is, India signed it in 2002 by the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA)
 doosraa he logistic exange memorondom agreement lemoawisara he communications and information security memorondom of agreement (cismoa)chauthaa he basic exange and copereshan agreement (BECA) During research, it was found that after signing the first agreement in 2002, the Vajpayee government and the Manmohan government were not very enthusiastic about signing the second, third and fourth agreement
 ashanka thi ki bharat america kii baahon main na chalaa jaae
 In a joint statement issued from Washington on Monday, the two countries also discussed giving India the title of a key defense partner, which was announced during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US this June
 bharat ke raksha mantri kaa yah daura bataata he ki donon paksh kai kshetron main raksha sambandhon ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 Apart from enhancing strategic partnership and regional cooperation, they also want to increase cooperation in exchange of each other's troops, defense techniques and search
 is samjhaute ke baad america, bharat ko raksha takanic or vyapaar main bharat ke darje ko ooncha karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 He will now share the things that he has done so far with only his close partners and stakeholders
 america ke kaaran bharat haal hi main Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) kaa sadsy hua he, jisaki bharat ke raksha visheshgyon ne koob tarif kii thi
 The joint statement said that there have been many agreements between the two in the field of the Navy, Air Force and Intelligence Systems
 america bharat kii nau sainik kshamtaaon ko badhaane main bhi madad karegaa
 Nine soldiers and military exercises continue between the two countries
 sainik sevaaon ke maamle main aapasi samaj or badhaane par bhi baat hui he
 After the agreement reached on Monday, it is being said that there has been a big change in the relationship between India and America
 yah badlaav 90 ke dashak se aa rahaa tha magar aarthik nitiyon ke kshetra main, lekin haal philhal main yah dosti raksha kaarobaar or saajhedaari kii taraf bhi mudi he
 This change has happened so fast that what could not happen in fifteen-sixteen years of Vajpayee and Manmohan happened in two-three months
 hamane is samjhaute ke bare main media main uplabdh saamagree kaa hi adhyayan kiya he
 Manmohan Singh had also placed his government at stake at the time of nuclear deal, the result of that deal is yet to come
 do saal ke bheetar modi sarkaar ne aatmavishvaas ke saath america kii taraf haath badhaayaa he
 But it does not seem that the fears have been completely ignored
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki isi kaaran raksha mantri parrikar ne limoa main kaaphi kuch sanshodhan karavaaya, jabaki iskaa ek tay draft hota he jis par america ne kai deshon ke saath 100 se adhik aise samjhaute kiye hai
 The United States has won a great deal with this agreement or an equal agreement has been reached between the two
 tippaniyan US Secretary of State John Carrey is in Delhi
 unhone mangalvaar kii shaam kaha ki itihaas main donon desh ek-duusare ke itane kareeb kabhi nahin rahe
 Carrie said that there is no doubt that the Haqqani network and lashkar-e-taiba operate from Pakistan
 lekin saath hi unhone pakistani pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or vahaan ke senapramukh raahil shareef se hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pakistan ne aatankiyon par karrwai kaa bharosa diya he, jisamen thodaa vaqt lagata he
 In a way, Kerry defended the Pakistani government
 america main bharat ke raksha mantri hai
 In Delhi too, there has been a lot of activity between India and USA in two days
 vakt kii zarurat ke hisaab se kootnithik or ranneetik sambandh badalte hai
 Are we standing at the same mouth of the time watching this scene or are we beginning to welcome unknown results
 yah bhi nahin hona chahie ki ham isaki kushbu se anjaan rah jaaen lekin khushrahami main hi puri shaam guzar jaae, yah bhi thik nahin he
 On the other hand, why China and Pakistan are worried about it
 pakistan kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan ko china ke saath aisa qaraar kar lenaa chahie
 Why is it being said in Chinese media that Pakistan and China can irritate India with the US agreement
 is tark se bharat koi kadam hi na badaye kya yah uchit hoga
 India, reading two of the four regular writers who wrote above America, felt that they were greatly influenced by this agreement
 em
 K
 bhadrakumar hai jo purv rajaniyak hai unhone apane lekh main kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 They said that bharat ne kabhi kisi videshi shakti ko apane sainik addon kaa istamaal karne nahin diya he
 Maintained strategic autonomy to avoid being part of any faction
 dekhnaa hoga ki bharat amareeki suvidhaon kaa istamaal zyaada karegaa yaa america bharat kii suvidhaon kaa
 During limited research, it was found that America has many bases in the vicinity of India
 pakistan, afghanistan, madhya asia, iran har jagah hai
 It also has bases in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, South Korea and Japan
 khadi ke deshon main tamaam adde bane hai, jahaan uske sainkadon ladaaku vimaan, vimanavahak pot, hazaron sainik tainaat hai
 Still why does he have discomfort to use Indian facilities
 uske liye ye aitihaasik kyon hai
 Is it because India has come close or because it is historical that there was a hideout everywhere around now but India remained
 yah zarur he ki limoa ke baad se India will be able to purchase state-of-the-art technology from the US for the Air Force and Navy
 epa-16 banane vaali company ab yah vimaan bharat main bhi bana sakati he
 But it was read that this company also manufactures in Ankara, Turkey
 yah bhi mila ki epa-16 ab purana ho gaya he, isliye use america se hataaya ja rahaa he
 The company making the F-16 is making the Lockheed Martin Corps F-35
 em
 K
 bhadrakumar ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi epa-16 kyon sweekaar karenge, agar epa-35 atyaadhunik ladaaku vimaan market main aa gaya he to
 He also has a question whether we are dreaming of China's equality with America
 kahin isse pakistan or china ek duusare ke or kareeb na aa jaaen
 Bhadrakumar's apprehension was given because he told you that most people are praising it
 agar bharat or america kaa itnaa qareeb aana aitihaasik he to ham bhi is itihaas ko aaj qareeb se dekhenge
 In Washington on Monday, India's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defense Minister Aston Carter signed an agreement called LEMOA
 Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
 Now the United States will be able to take help of India for the supply of fuel, repair of its fighters
 bharat bhi america se madad le sakegaa
 a joint statement issued on the occasion stated that the agreement would provide additional opportunities for practical exchanges
 sunne main to yah pankti behad saral he magar bina detail ke aapako isse kuch bhi pataa nahin lagegaa
 The Defense Minister said that neither of them was obliged to provide logistic support due to the agreement
 har cese main donon pakshon ko alag se manzuri leni padegi
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that there is no provision for building a military base in the logistics agreement between India and America
 yah unka bayaan he na ki samjhaute kii copy kaa detail saarvajanik hua he
 There is a great difference between the two will not build military bases and military bases can be used
 donon ke apane-apane khatre or kuubiyaan hongi
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that the Defense Minister has told an American journalist that he will first make the details of this agreement public and see what the reaction of the people is
 dashakon se ham america ke partner he hin
 Have already come closer
 lekin in samjhauton ke zarie partner hone kaa kya matlab he
 Just keep googleing that by becoming a partner of America, which country is such a country which has become super power in its area
 jamaane tak pakistan ko america kaa kareebi bataaya jaataa rahaa he, is kram main or bhi deshon ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 Has China also become powerful as a partner of America
 baharhaal bharat, america ke saath chaar buniyadi samjhaute karne vaala he
 These four agreements will complete the relationship between the two countries in the military field
 in chaar main se ek he LEMOA
 India has signed two out of four
 pehla he, general secority of military information agreement (GSOMIA), 2002 main bharat ne is par dastakhat kar diya tha
 Second is Logistic Exchange Memorandum Agreement LEMOA Third is Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) Fourth is Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) research ke dauraan padhane ko mila ki 2002 main pehle samjhaute par dastakhat karne ke baad vaajapeyi sarkaar or manmohan sarkaar duusare, tisare or chauthe samjhaute par dastakhat karne ko lekar bahut utsahit nahin thi
 It was feared that India should not go into the arms of America
 somvaar ko washington se jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya he ki donon deshon ne bharat ko pramukh raksha sahyogi kii padavi dene par bhi charchaa kii, jiskaa elaan isi june main pradhanmantri modi kii america yatra ke dauraan hua tha
 This visit by the Defense Minister of India shows how much importance both sides attach to defense relations in many areas
 ranneetik saajhedaari or kshetreey sahyog badhaane ke alaava ek-duusare ke sainikon ke aadan pradaan, raksha takanic or khoj main bhi sahyog badhanaa chaahate hai
 After this agreement, the US has agreed to elevate India's status in defense technology and trade
 wo ab un chizon ko saajha karegaa jo abhi tak sirf apane kareebi saajhedaaron or hissedaaron se karata aayaa he
 India has recently become a member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) due to America, which was well praised by defense experts of India
 saajha bayaan main bataaya gaya he ki nau sena, vaayu sena, khufia system ke kshetra main donon ke bich kai tarah ke qaraar hue hai
 The US will also help in enhancing India's nine military capabilities
 nau sainik or sainik abhyaas to donon mulkon ke bich hote hi rahete hai
 There has also been talk of mutual understanding and enhancement in the matter of military services
 somvaar ko hue samjhaute ke baad kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat or america ke aapasi rishte main kaaphi bada badlaav aa chukaa he
 This change was coming from the 90s but in the field of economic policies, but recently this friendship has also turned towards defense business and partnership
 itani tezi se ye badlaav aayaa he ki vajayapi or manmohan ke pandrah-solah saal main jo na ho sakaa wo do-teen maheene main ho gaya
 We have studied only the material available in the media about this agreement
 manmohan singh ne bhi newclear deal ke samay apni sarkaar daanv par laga di thi, us deal kaa nateeja aaj tak aana baaki he
 Within two years, the Modi government has confidently extended its hand to the United States
 par aisa nahin lagata ki ashankaon ko ekadam se darkinar kar diya he
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that this is why Defense Minister Parrikar got a lot of amendments done in Limoa, while it has a fixed draft on which America has entered more than 100 such agreements with many countries
 is qaraar se badi baazi america ne maari he yaa donon ke bich baraabar kaa qaraar hua he
 The comments dilli main america ke videsh mantri jon kairi hai
 He said on Tuesday evening that the two countries have never been so close to each other in history
 kairi ne kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki hakkaani network or lashkar-e-taiyaba pakistan se hi kaam karte hai
 But at the same time, he quoted talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his army chief Rahil Sharif, saying that Pakistan has given assurance of action to the terrorists, which takes some time
 ek tarah se kairi ne pakistani sarkaar kaa bachaav kar diya
 India's defense minister is in the US
 dilli main bhi bharat or america ke bich do dinon main kaaphi gatividhiyaan hui hai
 Diplomatic and strategic relationships change according to the need of the hour
 kya ham vakt ke usee muhane par khadey hokar yah nazaaraa dekh rahe hai yaa kisi aane vaale nateezon se anjaan swaagat karne main lage hai
 It should not also be that we should remain unaware of its smell, but the whole evening is spent in happiness, this is also not right
 duusari taraf ise lekar china or pakistan kyon pareshaan hai
 Why is it being said in Pakistan's media that Pakistan should make such an agreement with China
 china kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat amareeki qaraar se pakistan or china chidh sakate hai
 Should India not make any move with this logic, is it appropriate? bharat america ke upar likhane vaale do chaar niyamit jaankaron ko padhate hue laga ki ve is samjhaute se kaaphi prabhavit hai
 M
 ke
 Bhadrakumar who is a former diplomat has raised some questions in his article
 unhone kaha he ki India has never allowed any foreign power to use its military bases
 kisi gut kaa hissaa hone se bachane ke liye or ranneetik swaittata banaae rakhi
 It will have to be seen whether India will use more American facilities or America will use Indian facilities
 simit research ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki america kaa bharat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main tamaam adde hai
 Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran are everywhere
 singapore, philippinos, australia, dakshin korea or japan main bhi uske adde hai
 All the bases in the Gulf countries are built, where hundreds of its fighters, aircraft carriers, thousands of soldiers are stationed
 phir bhi use bhartiya suvidhaon ke istamaal karne kii bechaini kyon he
 Why are they historical for him? kya isliye ki bharat kareeb aayaa he yaa isliye aitihaasik he ki aas paas ab har jagah thikaana ho gaya tha magar bharat hi rah gaya tha
 It is sure that since Limoa bharat vayusena or nau sena ke liye america se atyaadhunik technology kareed sakegaa
 The company making the F-16 can now make this aircraft in India as well
 lekin padhane ko mila ki yah company turki ke ankara main bhi banaati he
 It was also found that the F-16 is now outdated, so it is being removed from the US
 epa-16 banane vaali company lokaheed martin kor epa-35 bana rahi he
 M
 ke
 Bhadrakumar has written that why Prime Minister Modi will accept F-16, if F-35 state-of-the-art fighter aircraft has come in the market
 unka yah bhi sawaal he ki kya ham america ke bharose china kii barabari kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 This should not make Pakistan and China closer to each other
 bhadrakumar kii ashanka ko jagah isliye di kyonki aapako bataaya hi ki zyaadaatar log isaki tarif kar rahe hai
 If India and the United States are so close together, then we too will see this history today
 har cese main donon pakshon ko alag se manzuri leni padegi
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that there is no provision for building a military base in the logistics agreement between India and America
 yah unka bayaan he na ki samjhaute kii copy kaa detail saarvajanik hua he
 There is a great difference between the two will not build military bases and military bases can be used
 donon ke apane-apane khatre or kuubiyaan hongi
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that the Defense Minister has told an American journalist that he will first make the details of this agreement public and see what the reaction of the people is
 dashakon se ham america ke partner he hin
 Have already come closer
 lekin in samjhauton ke zarie partner hone kaa kya matlab he
 Just keep googleing that by becoming a partner of America, which country is such a country which has become super power in its area
 jamaane tak pakistan ko america kaa kareebi bataaya jaataa rahaa he, is kram main or bhi deshon ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 Has China also become powerful as a partner of America
 baharhaal bharat, america ke saath chaar buniyadi samjhaute karne vaala he
 These four agreements will complete the relationship between the two countries in the military field
 in chaar main se ek he LEMOA
 India has signed two out of four
 pehla he, general secority of military information agreement (GSOMIA), 2002 main bharat ne is par dastakhat kar diya tha
 Second is Logistic Exchange Memorandum Agreement LEMOA Third is Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) Fourth is Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) research ke dauraan padhane ko mila ki 2002 main pehle samjhaute par dastakhat karne ke baad vaajapeyi sarkaar or manmohan sarkaar duusare, tisare or chauthe samjhaute par dastakhat karne ko lekar bahut utsahit nahin thi
 It was feared that India should not go into the arms of America
 somvaar ko washington se jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya he ki donon deshon ne bharat ko pramukh raksha sahyogi kii padavi dene par bhi charchaa kii, jiskaa elaan isi june main pradhanmantri modi kii america yatra ke dauraan hua tha
 This visit by the Defense Minister of India shows how much importance both sides attach to defense relations in many areas
 ranneetik saajhedaari or kshetreey sahyog badhaane ke alaava ek-duusare ke sainikon ke aadan pradaan, raksha takanic or khoj main bhi sahyog badhanaa chaahate hai
 After this agreement, the US has agreed to elevate India's status in defense technology and trade
 wo ab un chizon ko saajha karegaa jo abhi tak sirf apane kareebi saajhedaaron or hissedaaron se karata aayaa he
 India has recently become a member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) due to America, which was well praised by defense experts of India
 saajha bayaan main bataaya gaya he ki nau sena, vaayu sena, khufia system ke kshetra main donon ke bich kai tarah ke qaraar hue hai
 The US will also help in enhancing India's nine military capabilities
 nau sainik or sainik abhyaas to donon mulkon ke bich hote hi rahete hai
 There has also been talk of mutual understanding and enhancement in the matter of military services
 somvaar ko hue samjhaute ke baad kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat or america ke aapasi rishte main kaaphi bada badlaav aa chukaa he
 This change was coming from the 90s but in the field of economic policies, but recently this friendship has also turned towards defense business and partnership
 itani tezi se ye badlaav aayaa he ki vajayapi or manmohan ke pandrah-solah saal main jo na ho sakaa wo do-teen maheene main ho gaya
 We have studied only the material available in the media about this agreement
 manmohan singh ne bhi newclear deal ke samay apni sarkaar daanv par laga di thi, us deal kaa nateeja aaj tak aana baaki he
 Within two years, the Modi government has confidently extended its hand to the United States
 par aisa nahin lagata ki ashankaon ko ekadam se darkinar kar diya he
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that this is why Defense Minister Parrikar got a lot of amendments done in Limoa, while it has a fixed draft on which America has entered more than 100 such agreements with many countries
 is qaraar se badi baazi america ne maari he yaa donon ke bich baraabar kaa qaraar hua he
 The comments dilli main america ke videsh mantri jon kairi hai
 He said on Tuesday evening that the two countries have never been so close to each other in history
 kairi ne kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki hakkaani network or lashkar-e-taiyaba pakistan se hi kaam karte hai
 But at the same time, he quoted talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his army chief Rahil Sharif, saying that Pakistan has given assurance of action to the terrorists, which takes some time
 ek tarah se kairi ne pakistani sarkaar kaa bachaav kar diya
 India's defense minister is in the US
 dilli main bhi bharat or america ke bich do dinon main kaaphi gatividhiyaan hui hai
 Diplomatic and strategic relationships change according to the need of the hour
 kya ham vakt ke usee muhane par khadey hokar yah nazaaraa dekh rahe hai yaa kisi aane vaale nateezon se anjaan swaagat karne main lage hai
 It should not also be that we should remain unaware of its smell, but the whole evening is spent in happiness, this is also not right
 duusari taraf ise lekar china or pakistan kyon pareshaan hai
 Why is it being said in Pakistan's media that Pakistan should make such an agreement with China
 china kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat amareeki qaraar se pakistan or china chidh sakate hai
 Should India not make any move with this logic, is it appropriate? bharat america ke upar likhane vaale do chaar niyamit jaankaron ko padhate hue laga ki ve is samjhaute se kaaphi prabhavit hai

 Bhadrakumar who is a former diplomat has raised some questions in his article
 unhone kaha he ki India has never allowed any foreign power to use its military bases
 kisi gut kaa hissaa hone se bachane ke liye or ranneetik swaittata banaae rakhi
 It will have to be seen whether India will use more American facilities or America will use Indian facilities
 simit research ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki america kaa bharat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main tamaam adde hai
 Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran are everywhere
 singapore, philippinos, australia, dakshin korea or japan main bhi uske adde hai
 All the bases in the Gulf countries are built, where hundreds of its fighters, aircraft carriers, thousands of soldiers are stationed
 phir bhi use bhartiya suvidhaon ke istamaal karne kii bechaini kyon he
 Why are they historical for him? kya isliye ki bharat kareeb aayaa he yaa isliye aitihaasik he ki aas paas ab har jagah thikaana ho gaya tha magar bharat hi rah gaya tha
 It is sure that since Limoa bharat vayusena or nau sena ke liye america se atyaadhunik technology kareed sakegaa
 The company making the F-16 can now make this aircraft in India as well
 lekin padhane ko mila ki yah company turki ke ankara main bhi banaati he
 It was also found that the F-16 is now outdated, so it is being removed from the US
 epa-16 banane vaali company lokaheed martin kor epa-35 bana rahi he
 M
 ke
 Bhadrakumar has written that why Prime Minister Modi will accept F-16, if F-35 state-of-the-art fighter aircraft has come in the market
 unka yah bhi sawaal he ki kya ham america ke bharose china kii barabari kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 This should not make Pakistan and China closer to each other
 bhadrakumar kii ashanka ko jagah isliye di kyonki aapako bataaya hi ki zyaadaatar log isaki tarif kar rahe hai
 If India and the United States are so close together, then we too will see this history today
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki raksha mantri ne ek amareeki patrkaar ko kaha he ki pehle ve is samjhaute kii detail saarvajanik karenge or dekhenge ki logon kii pratikriya kya he
 We have been partners of America for decades
 kareeb aa hi chuke hai
 But what does it mean to be a partner through these agreements? bas ye google karte rahen ki america kaa partner banakar duniya main koun sa aisa mulk he jo apane ilaake main super power hua he
 For the time being Pakistan is said to be close to America, in this order more countries can be named
 kya china bhi america kaa partner banakar shaktishaalee bana he
 However, India is going to have four basic agreements with the US
 ye chaaron samjhaute donon mulkon kii sainya kshetra main rishtedaari ko mukammal kar denge
 One of these four is LEMOA
 bharat ne chaar main se do par dastakhat kar die hai
 The first is, India signed it in 2002 by the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA)
 doosraa he logistic exange memorondom agreement lemoawisara he communications and information security memorondom of agreement (cismoa)chauthaa he basic exange and copereshan agreement (BECA) During research, it was found that after signing the first agreement in 2002, the Vajpayee government and the Manmohan government were not very enthusiastic about signing the second, third and fourth agreement
 ashanka thi ki bharat america kii baahon main na chalaa jaae
 In a joint statement issued from Washington on Monday, the two countries also discussed giving India the title of a key defense partner, which was announced during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US this June
 bharat ke raksha mantri kaa yah daura bataata he ki donon paksh kai kshetron main raksha sambandhon ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 Apart from enhancing strategic partnership and regional cooperation, they also want to increase cooperation in exchange of each other's troops, defense techniques and search
 is samjhaute ke baad america, bharat ko raksha takanic or vyapaar main bharat ke darje ko ooncha karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 He will now share the things that he has done so far with only his close partners and stakeholders
 america ke kaaran bharat haal hi main Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) kaa sadsy hua he, jisaki bharat ke raksha visheshgyon ne koob tarif kii thi
 The joint statement said that there have been many agreements between the two in the field of the Navy, Air Force and Intelligence Systems
 america bharat kii nau sainik kshamtaaon ko badhaane main bhi madad karegaa
 Nine soldiers and military exercises continue between the two countries
 sainik sevaaon ke maamle main aapasi samaj or badhaane par bhi baat hui he
 After the agreement reached on Monday, it is being said that there has been a big change in the relationship between India and America
 yah badlaav 90 ke dashak se aa rahaa tha magar aarthik nitiyon ke kshetra main, lekin haal philhal main yah dosti raksha kaarobaar or saajhedaari kii taraf bhi mudi he
 This change has happened so fast that what could not happen in fifteen-sixteen years of Vajpayee and Manmohan happened in two-three months
 hamane is samjhaute ke bare main media main uplabdh saamagree kaa hi adhyayan kiya he
 Manmohan Singh had also placed his government at stake at the time of nuclear deal, the result of that deal is yet to come
 do saal ke bheetar modi sarkaar ne aatmavishvaas ke saath america kii taraf haath badhaayaa he
 But it does not seem that the fears have been completely ignored
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki isi kaaran raksha mantri parrikar ne limoa main kaaphi kuch sanshodhan karavaaya, jabaki iskaa ek tay draft hota he jis par america ne kai deshon ke saath 100 se adhik aise samjhaute kiye hai
 The United States has won a great deal with this agreement or an equal agreement has been reached between the two
 tippaniyan US Secretary of State John Carrey is in Delhi
 unhone mangalvaar kii shaam kaha ki itihaas main donon desh ek-duusare ke itane kareeb kabhi nahin rahe
 Carrie said that there is no doubt that the Haqqani network and lashkar-e-taiba operate from Pakistan
 lekin saath hi unhone pakistani pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or vahaan ke senapramukh raahil shareef se hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pakistan ne aatankiyon par karrwai kaa bharosa diya he, jisamen thodaa vaqt lagata he
 In a way, Kerry defended the Pakistani government
 america main bharat ke raksha mantri hai
 In Delhi too, there has been a lot of activity between India and USA in two days
 vakt kii zarurat ke hisaab se kootnithik or ranneetik sambandh badalte hai
 Are we standing at the same mouth of the time watching this scene or are we beginning to welcome unknown results
 yah bhi nahin hona chahie ki ham isaki kushbu se anjaan rah jaaen lekin khushrahami main hi puri shaam guzar jaae, yah bhi thik nahin he
 On the other hand, why China and Pakistan are worried about it
 pakistan kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan ko china ke saath aisa qaraar kar lenaa chahie
 Why is it being said in Chinese media that Pakistan and China can irritate India with the US agreement
 is tark se bharat koi kadam hi na badaye kya yah uchit hoga
 India, reading two of the four regular writers who wrote above America, felt that they were greatly influenced by this agreement

 bhadrakumar hai jo purv rajaniyak hai unhone apane lekh main kuch sawaal uthaae hai

 Maintained strategic autonomy to avoid being part of any faction
 dekhnaa hoga ki bharat amareeki suvidhaon kaa istamaal zyaada karegaa yaa america bharat kii suvidhaon kaa
 During limited research, it was found that America has many bases in the vicinity of India
 pakistan, afghanistan, madhya asia, iran har jagah hai
 It also has bases in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, South Korea and Japan
 khadi ke deshon main tamaam adde bane hai, jahaan uske sainkadon ladaaku vimaan, vimanavahak pot, hazaron sainik tainaat hai
 Still why does he have discomfort to use Indian facilities
 uske liye ye aitihaasik kyon hai
 Is it because India has come close or because it is historical that there was a hideout everywhere around now but India remained
 yah zarur he ki limoa ke baad se India will be able to purchase state-of-the-art technology from the US for the Air Force and Navy
 epa-16 banane vaali company ab yah vimaan bharat main bhi bana sakati he
 But it was read that this company also manufactures in Ankara, Turkey
 yah bhi mila ki epa-16 ab purana ho gaya he, isliye use america se hataaya ja rahaa he
 The company making the F-16 is making the Lockheed Martin Corps F-35

 bhadrakumar ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi epa-16 kyon sweekaar karenge, agar epa-35 atyaadhunik ladaaku vimaan market main aa gaya he to

 kahin isse pakistan or china ek duusare ke or kareeb na aa jaaen
 Bhadrakumar's apprehension was given because he told you that most people are praising it

 Within two years, the Modi government has confidently extended its hand to the United States

 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that this is why Defense Minister Parrikar got a lot of amendments done in Limoa, while it has a fixed draft on which America has entered more than 100 such agreements with many countries

 Bhadrakumar who is a former diplomat has raised some questions in his article

 It will have to be seen whether India will use more American facilities or America will use Indian facilities
 simit research ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki america kaa bharat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main tamaam adde hai
 Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran are everywhere
 singapore, philippinos, australia, dakshin korea or japan main bhi uske adde hai
 All the bases in the Gulf countries are built, where hundreds of its fighters, aircraft carriers, thousands of soldiers are stationed
 phir bhi use bhartiya suvidhaon ke istamaal karne kii bechaini kyon he
 Why are they historical for him? kya isliye ki bharat kareeb aayaa he yaa isliye aitihaasik he ki aas paas ab har jagah thikaana ho gaya tha magar bharat hi rah gaya tha
 It is sure that since Limoa bharat vayusena or nau sena ke liye america se atyaadhunik technology kareed sakegaa

 On the other hand, why China and Pakistan are worried about it
 pakistan kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan ko china ke saath aisa qaraar kar lenaa chahie
 Why is it being said in Chinese media that Pakistan and China can irritate India with the US agreement
 is tark se bharat koi kadam hi na badaye kya yah uchit hoga
 India, reading two of the four regular writers who wrote above America, felt that they were greatly influenced by this agreement

 bhadrakumar hai jo purv rajaniyak hai unhone apane lekh main kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 They said that bharat ne kabhi kisi videshi shakti ko apane sainik addon kaa istamaal karne nahin diya he
 Maintained strategic autonomy to avoid being part of any faction
 dekhnaa hoga ki bharat amareeki suvidhaon kaa istamaal zyaada karegaa yaa america bharat kii suvidhaon kaa
 During limited research, it was found that America has many bases in the vicinity of India
 pakistan, afghanistan, madhya asia, iran har jagah hai
 It also has bases in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, South Korea and Japan
 khadi ke deshon main tamaam adde bane hai, jahaan uske sainkadon ladaaku vimaan, vimanavahak pot, hazaron sainik tainaat hai
 Still why does he have discomfort to use Indian facilities
 uske liye ye aitihaasik kyon hai
 Is it because India has come close or because it is historical that there was a hideout everywhere around now but India remained
 yah zarur he ki limoa ke baad se India will be able to purchase state-of-the-art technology from the US for the Air Force and Navy
 epa-16 banane vaali company ab yah vimaan bharat main bhi bana sakati he
 But it was read that this company also manufactures in Ankara, Turkey
 yah bhi mila ki epa-16 ab purana ho gaya he, isliye use america se hataaya ja rahaa he
 The company making the F-16 is making the Lockheed Martin Corps F-35

 bijliaap kaa vaada - dilli ko 24 ghante bijli milegi or vah bhi aadhe daam par
 Possible excuse - we have to face the central government
 aakhir ham khud itani jaldi bijli to bana nahin sakate
 4
 jan lokapalap kaa vaada - jan lokapal bill paas karaayenge
 Possible excuse - we are not getting support from central government
 centre kaa kahana he ki jab dilli ke paas pehle se hi he lokayukta he to jan lokapal bill kii kya jarurat he

 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 or 35A ko lekar lagaataar bahes chhidi hui he
 The whole country is eyeing this matter
 kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne isse pehle sansad main kaha tha ki bhartiya samvidhan main anuchhed 370 asthaayee he
 Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and no one can separate it from the country
 amit shah ko is par mili-juli pratikriya mili
 But the question is, what is Article 370 after all? in 10 binduon main aap is anuchhed ke bare main jaaniye
 1
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 or anuchhed 35A ko lekar samvidhan visheshgyon kii apni raay he
 Constitution expert Subhash Kashyap aajtak
 in se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki isamen koi do raay nahin he ki bhartiya samvidhan kaa anuchhed 370 asthaayee he
 This thing is mentioned in the article itself
 2
 As far as the removal of Article 370 is concerned, two things have gone into the Constitution regarding this
 pehali baat ye he ki anuchhed 370 ko jammu kashmir vidhansabha kii sahmati se sansad hataa sakati he, jabaki doosraa praavdhaan he ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 368 ke tahat sansad do tihaai bahumat se isko samaapt kar sakati he
 3
 subhash kashyap kaa kahana he ki anuchhed 368 sansad ko samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed main sanshodhan karne yaa usko hataane kaa adhikaar detii he
 This only solves many clues about Article 370
 4
 Constitution expert DK Dubey aajtak
 in se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki anuchhed 370 jammu kashmir rajya ke liye vishesh upbandh nahin karata he balki ye rajya ke liye asthaayee upbandh karata he
 The Indian Parliament can end this article with a two-thirds majority
 5
 Ambedkar was not in favor of Article 370: DK Dubey says that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar was not in favor of Article 370 in the Indian Constitution
 lihaaja is anuchhed ko samvidhan main jodne kaa prastaav shaikh abdulla ne rakhaa tha or yah anuchhed maamuli charchaa ke baad samvidhan main jod diya gaya
 6
 is anuchhed ko lekar sansad main gambhirtha se charchaa bhi nahin kii gai thi
 DK Dubey says that Ambedkar had said that he is not happy about the policy of Jammu and Kashmir
 7
 Constitution expert Dubey says that Article 35A of the Indian Constitution was added through the Presidential Order
 jab is presidential order ko jari kiya gaya us samay pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru the or raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad the
 Article 35A is the real root cause of Kashmir Jammu and Kashmir problem
 presidential order ke dwaara isko samaapt bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 8
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 main jammu kashmir rajya ke liye asthaayee upbandh kiya gaya he
 The temporary provision, not the special provision, has been used for Jammu and Kashmir
 9
 Subsequently, Article 35A was added to the Constitution by issuing the Constitution (application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954 under Article 370
 10
 In 2014, an NGO filed a petition in the Supreme Court, terming this article as a provision against the spirit of India and promoting separatism
 is yachika main anuchhed 35A or anuchhed 370 kii vaidhaniktaa ko chunauti di gai thi
 In this petition, it was argued that after independence, the Constituent Assembly was formed to make the constitution of the country, including 4 representatives of Jammu and Kashmir
 saath hi jammu-kashmir rajya ko kabhi bhi special status nahin diya gaya
 It was also argued that 35-A was a temporary provision which was added to stabilize the situation in the state at that time
