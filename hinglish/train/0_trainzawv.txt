 Deception: Pakistan, co-author and British journalist Adrien Levy of The United States and the Secret Trade in Nuclear Weapons, says, "the wave of radicalism has almost turned into hatred for America and the way it has been in Pakistan's domestic and foreign policies

 strot: watsap, financial express Was there any other killer of Mahatma Gandhi? Although the police believe the story that three bullets were fired at Gandhi, but was there also a fourth bullet that was fired by someone other than Nathuram Godse? Many such questions have been raised in a petition filed in the Supreme Court and it has also been requested to reveal the big conspiracy behind the assassination of Gandhi by setting up a new commission of inquiry

 And the remaining four unarmed bullets were recovered by the police

 ) The son of an auto driver, Pranav Dhanavade became an overnight celebrity by setting a world record of 1009 runs in the school tournament
 unhen cricket ke diggaj sachin tendulkar, emes dhoni or kai filmi sitaron se bhi prashansa mili
 Not only this, the Maharashtra government has also decided to bear the expenses of coaching and studies of Pranav Dhanavade
 vahiin mumbai cricket association pranav ko har maheene 10 hajaar rupee scolerishap degi
 But this record of Pranav left behind the hard work of those students who left the studies and were on the field
 khel khatm hone ke intjaar main thi vipakshi timpranav pehle hi din 652 ran par noteout rah kar 117 saal kaa record tod chuke the, unki vipakshi team (aryaa gurukul) ke chaatr buree tarah thak kar khel khatm hone ke intjaar main the
 But the coach of KC Gandhi High School kept the match going
 aryaa gurukul kii team pehali pari main sirf 32 ran par simat gai thi phir bhi kasee gandhi hai skool nen badale main 1465 ran banaae, jisaki jarurat hi nahin thi
 The opposition team played in compulsion Match Arya Gurukul's coach Yogesh Jagtap said that he had a team of 12 years old players to play under-16 matches
 unki senior team isliye taiyaar nahin thi kyonki chah mukhya khilaadi pre-board pariksha main vyast the
 But if he refuses to play this match, he might not get an entry next year

 Fearing injury, he failed to stop Pranav's 129 fours and 59 sixes
 match ke dauraan kul 21 kaich chodi gai
 However, the mistake of Pranav Dhanavade cannot be found in this because his goal was to score the biggest score while batting the opener
 bas sawaal yah uthta he ki itane bade score se koun sa uddeshy puraa hota he
 Strict rules are required at the school level
 Former India captain and current Indian under-19 coach Rahul Dravid was also not impressed with this score
 unke mutabik junior level ke cricket main kuch sakht niyamon kii jarurat he jisase zyada se zyada bachche hissaa le saken
 The opportunity should not be given only to children who are already trained and can score a century
 aise bachche bhi jaruri hai lekin jonal maichon main
 In school and club cricket, certain rules should be made which stipulate playing time for all
 sabhi ko mili pratibha dikhaane kaa maukarahul dravid ne meke pataudi memorial main ek vyaakhyaan main kaha tha ki jab 11 khilaadiyon kaa maidan ke liye chayan hota he, to unke baad 4 aise bhi bachche hote hai jo baithe rahete hai
 They take a full day off from school and have nothing to do
 pranav dhanavde ke 1009 ranon se duusare chaatro ko apni pratibha dikhaane kaa mauka hi nahin mil sakaa
 Not only this, many young children who had come out of the house with the dream of becoming a great bowler, returned with the disappointment of being beaten by a batsman

 ) SP general secretary Azam Khan, who had played an important role in the politics of Rampur 15 years ago and played an important role in getting an MP, is now facing the same Jayaprada face-to-face Rampur seat against Azam Khan as a BJP candidate
 ajam khan ne jayaprada ko lekar apattijanak tippanee kii to chunaav ayog ne 72 ghante tak unke chunaav prachaar par har tarah kii bandishen laga di hai
 However, the political and caste equations of Rampur are such that in which beating Azam Khan is not easy for Jayaprada but chewing iron gram
 rampur kii raajnneeti main ajam khan pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav maidan main utre hai
 Film actress Jayaprada, a two-time MP from this seat to contest Azam, is in the fray as a BJP candidate
 vahiin, congress ne party ke rashtriya sachiv or purv vidhayak sanjay kapur ko utaara he
 It is for the first time in Rampur after 1967 that the Congress has fielded a person from outside the 'nawab family' of Rampur
 uttar pradesh kii rampur loksabhaa seat aisi he, jahaan muslim matadaata hinduon se zyada hai
 According to the 2011 census Rampur has 51 percent Muslim population
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke nepal singh jeetne main tab kaamyaab rahe the, jab congress ne nawab kazim ali khan ko, sapa ne nasir ahamed khan ko or basapa ne akbar hossain ko maidan main utaara tha
 The BJP candidate got the benefit of the Muslim vote split due to Muslim candidates from all the three parties
 iske baavjood sapa ummidavaar ko mahaj 23 hajaar voton se haar mili thi
 The Nawab family has dominated the Rampur seat for years
 congress ne ab tak lagbhag har chunaav main nawab parivaar ke hi kisi sadsy ko tikat diya he
 This is the first time that the Congress has played bet on Sanjay Kapoor by not giving tickets to anyone from this influential family of Rampur
 aise main pramukh raajnneetik dalon ke ummidavaaron ko dekhen to ajam khan eklaute muslim ummidavaar hai
 In such a situation, Azam Khan has the support of BSP and RLD
 aise main rampur kii siyasat main jitna bhi dhruvikaran hoga iskaa sidhaa phayda ajam khan ko mil saktaa he
 However, Jayaprada won the 2009 Lok Sabha election despite Azam Khan's opposition
 isi tarah se ajam khan ne 10 saal pehle bhi jayaprada ke liye galat bayaanbaji kii thi
 At that time, Jaya Prada cried from the stage about Azam Khan's statement
 iskaa unhen siyaasi phayda mila tha
 Being from SP, Muslim voters voted despite Azam Khan's opposition
 lekin is baar ke siyaasi sameekaran kaaphi badale hue hai
 Jayaprada is in the fray as a BJP candidate instead of SP
 itnaa hi nahin rampur nawab khandaan se koi pratyaashee nahin he
 In such a situation, the entire political field for Azam Khan seems empty
 sapa ke muslim cheharaa maane jane vaale ajam khan rampur vidhansabha seat se 9 baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 Not only this, three of the five assembly seats in Rampur are controlled by the SP
 iske alaava rampur ke nawab khan kii siyasat in dinon haashiye par he
 Nawab Kazim Ali, the political heir of Rampur, was elected MLA by defeating Azam Khan's son by record votes
 iske baad nawab parivaar ke kisi kaa loksabhaa chunaav main nahin utarane se musalamaanon ke saamne koi doosraa vikalp nahin dikh rahaa he
 Though the Congress candidate of the Nawab family is Sanjay Kapoor, in the present situation, a large section of Muslim voters are seen with the alliance
 rampur kii siyasat main nawab kaa kabja1957 se hue abtak hue kul 16 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne rampur loksabhaa seat se nawab khandaan ke logon ko hi maidan main utaara
 In which this clan has won the Lok Sabha elections 9 times
 julfikar ali khan urf mikki miyaan 5 baar saansad rahe, vahiin unki patni nur baanon bhi 1996 or 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main jeet hasil kar loksabhaa pahunchi hai
 Azam Khan has drawn his political streak against the Nawab family
 rampur ke siyasat se nawab parivaar ko maat dene ke liye 2004 main ajam khan ne jaya pradaa ko chunaav ladaakar sansad pahunchaaya tha
 But Jayaprada stood with Amar Singh in the battle for political supremacy of Azam Khan and Amar Singh
 yaheen se adaavat itani bad gai ki wo sadak tak najar ai
 Azam Khan has been openly making rhetoric for Jaya Prada
 haalanki is baar donon kaa sidhaa muqabla he
 Maharashtra has now formed a coalition government of NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress
 shivasena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakare (uddhav Thackeray) maharashtra ke mukhyamantrike rup main shapath bhi le chuke hai
 As soon as he became the Chief Minister, Uddhav Thackeray first stopped the project of cutting the Aarey Forest for the construction of the metro of Maharashtra and also decided to withdraw the complaint against the workers

 Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma, who has been the target of critics for some time due to poor form, said on Thursday that he is happy with the way he is bowling right now
 ishanth ne newjiland ke khilaaf pehle test cricket match ke shuruaati din 62 ran dekar do wicket liye or is bich apane 54wein test match main 150 wicket bhi puure kiye
 He said after the first day's play ended, taking 150 wickets in Test matches is a big achievement for me
 main acchhee gendbaaji kar rahaa hum
 i also bowled well in South Africa and i don't think i need to worry about my rhythm
 abhi main jaisi gendbaaji kar rahaa hum, usase kaaphi khush hum
 Ishant and Zaheer Khan took two wickets each, but despite this, New Zealand captain Brandon mccullum and Kane Williamson managed to score 329 for four on the first day thanks to centuries
 subah ek samay uskaa score teen wicket par 30 ran tha
 Ishant said, "we had the ball in right field all day, but the batsmen are also credited
" unhone vastav main bahut acha khel dikhaaya
 The wicket became good for batting as the day progressed, especially after lunch
 is tarah ke wicket par dhairya banaaye rakhane or sahi kshetra main gendbaaji karne kii jarurat padati he

 kingmekar ke role main jananaayak janata party ke netaa dushyant chautaladushyant chautaala party kii ranneeti par shuukravaar ko dilli main baithak karengekhan to haryana main abaki baar 75 paar ke bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke armaan the, to kahaan ab sarkaar banane ke liye bhi number jugadne kii naubat aa gai he
 The BJP is still the number 1 party in Haryana but the leader of Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) has gone to the role of Kingmaker
 sutron ke mutabik congress, dushyant chautaala ko dipti siem kaa pad dene ko taiyaar he, lekin wo pattey kholane ko raji nahin he
 The results and trends of Haryana are showing that if Kikangres had not struggled with internal violence before the election, the equations could have been different
 haalanki abhi congress mukaable main haar nahin maan rahi he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has appealed that all anti-bjp leaders come together and form the government
 haalanki unhone mukhyamantri pad ko lekar kuch bhi elaan nahin kiya
 Let me tell you, there are chances of hung assembly in Haryana
 jejepi netaa dushyant singh chautaala ne kaha ki unhone party kii ranneeti par charchaa karne ke liye dilli main shuukravaar subah 11 baje party kaaryakarini kii baithak bulaai he
 Amidst his comments, it has been reported that he is pushing for the post of Chief Minister as a condition for any agreement that may be reached after the election
 90-sadasyeey haryana vidhansabha main koi bhi party bahumat ke jaadui aankade ko paar karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 BJP 40, Congress 31 and other parties are seen winning 19 seats
 bijepi 37 siten jeet chuki he jabaki teen siton par use badhat he
 How will the government be formed in Haryana and what can be the equation, let us know
 1-bijepi or nirdaleey kaa gathjodbijepi40 siten jeet chuki he
 It needs 6 more seats for majority as the magic figure of majority in the 90-member Haryana Assembly is 46
 bijepi ko kam pad rahi 6 siten nirdaleey ummidavaar de sakate hai
 These are the same candidates who contested the election as rebels on not getting tickets from BJP and won
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki apni mul party se inaki sulah ho jaae or apana samarthan dekar manohar laal khatter ko dobaaraa mukhyamantri banavaa den
 BJP can offer them a big post because the big ministers of the Khattar government have been out of the ground seeing the defeat
 lihaaja nirdaleeyon ko bada role diya ja saktaa he
 2-congress-jjp-other alliance Congress has 31 seats and JJP has 10 seats
 lihaaja congress-jejepi or anya kagathabandhansarkaar bananaa chaahe to use 6 or siton kii jarurat padengi
 These seats will come from other parties
 lekin isamen dikkat yah he ki anya ummidavaaron main 6 bijepi ke baagi hai, jinka congress kheme main janaa philhal mushkil lag rahaa he
 Other than 6, the remaining four cannot form a government by supporting the Congress
 is surat main gathbandhan kii sarkaar tabhi ban sakati he, jab anya dalon ke 6 vidhayak congress kii ore shift hon or jejepi ke saath milakar bhupendra hooda kii sarkaar banavaaen
 This is unlikely to happen because the JJP does not agree to unconditionally support anyone
 3-bijepi ko dushyant chautaala kaa samarthanek sthiti aisi bhi ban rahi he ki dushyantchautalakhud aage aaen or bijepi ko samarthan dene par raji hon
 There are reports quoting sources that Chautala has spoken of supporting the BJP
 isamen dikkat yah aegi ki bijepi dushyant chautaala ko mukhyamantri pad nahin de sakati kyonki donon partiyon main siton kaa antar kaaphi zyada he
 However, by making Chautala the deputy CM and supporting the independents, the BJP can enjoy a good government in Haryana
 aisi surat main mukhyamantrimanohar laal khattarhonge or chautaala dipti siem
 Independents who support can get the bjp's car forward by getting a creamy ministerial post
 4-haryana main karnataka formulaharyana main bhi karnataka formula lagu ho saktaa he
 In Karnataka, despite the Congress having more seats, it made JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister
 vahaan bhi haryana jaise halaat the, kyonki kisi party ko bahumat nahin tha
 But the Congress gave a call for forming a non-bjp government and sacrificed the CM chair and made Kumaraswamy as the Chief Minister
 yah alag baat he ki sarkaar shuru se danvadol rahi or antat gir gai
 If the Congress wants to implement such a formula in Haryana, it can take support of JJP
 dushyant chautaala ko mukhyamantri pad diya jaae or ieneldi samet nirdaleeyon kaa samarthan mili
 However, in this too, the case of 6 independents who are rebels of BJP
 aankadon kaa ganit bataata he ki dushyant chautaala sarkaar banane ke liye jitne mahatvapurn hai, unase kam nirdaleey bhi nahin hai kyonki unke bina kisi kii sarkaar banati nahin dikhti
 Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's earnings are going to increase tremendously
 bat tathaa sports ke saamaan banane vaali australian company sparton sports se hue ek qaraar ke mutabik vah usase spancership ke badale 18 se 20 karod rupye tak le sakenge

 west indies ke khilaaf dhoni ne sparton kaa bat istemaal kiya tha

 The interesting thing is that Reebok does not make bats and implements them by buying from other companies
 sachin tendulkar kaa bhi bat ke liye tagada qaraar tha
 He had tied up with MRF for Rs 4 crore per year
 emref bhi bat nahin banaati he
 Similarly, Virat Kohli had signed an agreement with MRF which 6
 5 karod rupye kaa he
 According to Arun Pandey, owner of Reethi Sports, which manages Dhoni's advertising, we have now started taking sponsorship in pieces
 isse hamen zyada raashi milti he
 Dhoni has also tied up with Amity University for sponsorship under which he will get Rs 6 crore per year

 According to estimates, the film has grossed Rs 3 crore on Tuesday
 is hisaab se film ne ab tak 163 karod rupee kii kamai kar lee he
 However, there are no official figures for it yet
 akshay kumaar (akshay Kumar) kii film 'mishan mangal' (mission Mangal) ne videshon main somvaar tak 5
 8 million
 is baat kii jaankaree taran adarsh ne twit kar di thi
 At the same time, the film 'mission Mangal' in West Bengal has become Akshay Kumar's highest grossing film
 bataa den is film ne akshay kumaar kii hi kesari or jolly elelbi 2 kaa record tod diya he
 The story of the film 'mission Mangal' begins with the failure of the mission named GSLV C-39
 iske mishan diarector rakesh dhawan (akshay Kumar) or project diarector tara scindia (vidya Balan) hote hai
 As the mission fails, Rakesh shifts Dhawan to a Mars mission and hands over the command to the scientist from NASA for the GSLV C-39 project
 phir niraash hokar ghar main baithi tara ko puri talane kii vidhi se mars mishan kaa project sujhata he, jiske liye dobaaraa nai team taiyaar kii jaati he
 It consists of Sharman Joshi, Sonakshi Sinha, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, Nitya Menon and HG Dattatreya
 rafel ko lekar bayaanbaji or ghotaale ke aaropon ke bich sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki sahi main agar yah fiter plane hota to nateeja kuch or hota
 After all, what is special about this aircraft that is more dangerous than aircraft like F-16s that are with Pakistan
 is vimaan kii jo sabase badi khaasiyat he vah yah he ki '150 kimi kii biond vizual range missile daagne kii kshamta
 That is, this aircraft can be targeted from 150 kilometers away

 a recent survey by India Today Group c voters has revealed that after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the role of regional parties will be very important and their cooperation will be necessary in forming the government
 pichley kaaphi varshon se ham dekh rahe hai ki kendra main gathbandhan kii sarkarein ban rahi hai
 In these regional parties, at their convenience, chose their partner and decided to stay in power or opposition
 haalanki iske liye vah ek kaaman shabd kaa istemaal karte rahe jo he sampradayikta
 Saying that to oppose them, he usually bowed down to the Congress
 lekin jab gathbandhan kii sarkare banati he to pramukh dal ko kshetreey dalon ke dawaab main rahanaa padataa he or vahaan unki sharten chalati hai
 They work on their own terms, the consequences of which not only the main party but also the country have to face
 pichley kaaphi samay se ham yah dekh rahe hai or jhel bhi rahe hai
 Whether it was AIADMK or DMK or Trinamool Congress or NCP, everyone has given their conditions as far as possible
 unhone khule aam na keval malaaidaar mantralayon kii maang kii balki kuch to bhrashtachar main bhi lipt hue or poochtacha karne par sarkaar giraane kii dhamkee dene se bhi baj nahin aae
 Of course our democracy seems to be maturing and this is also an example of the formation of shared governments, but the behavior of regional parties and their bosses is not so at all
 darasal in kshatrapon ke liye party ek jameendaari kii tarah he jahaan sab kuch apana hota he or siddhant taak par rakh die jate hai
 For them personal interest and little more state interest are important
 is prakriya main ve desh hit ko peeche chhod dete hai jaisaa srilanka ke maamle main dramuk kaa yaa bangladesh ke maamle main trinmul kaa rahaa he
 These parties did not allow certain necessary policies to be implemented for the country due to their petty interests
 kshetreey partiyon ne apni suvidha se gathjod kiye or tode, siddhanton kii baaten to phijul thim
 But it was also the fault of the major parties
 satta paane ke lobh main unhone bhi turant samjhaute kiye, yah dekhe bagaiyr ki inkaa kya parinaam hoga
 He also succumbed to blackmailing several times and worked on his terms
 pramukh dal agar kshetreey dalon ke saamne na jhuken to usase aisa jaruri nahin ki unki sarkaar gir jaae jaisaa hamane upie -2 ke kaarykaal main dekha
 The Congress refused to succumb to many things about the Trinamool and the DMK
 lekin yah tab hua jab kaaphi tamaasha ho chukaa tha
 However, it is certain that the next government will also be formed with the help of these satraps and they will enter any alliance on their own terms
 yah desh ke liye bura hoga, bahut bura

 In December 2015, only Rs 61 crore was transacted through digital transactions, which has increased to 153 crore in October 2017
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki sarkaar internet kii pahunch gaanv-gaanv tak le jane ke liye kai kadam uthaa rahi he
 Last month, Amitabh Kant, CEO of the Policy Commission, said that with 150 million GB of mobile data consumption per month, India has reached the top in terms of data consumption
 bharat kaa mobile data upbhog china or america ke sanyukt upbhog se bhi zyada he

 ) vikram lander se tutaa isro kaa samparkvikram lander se sampark sthapit kii koshishaisro ke vaigyanik ab is baat baat kii jaanch kar rahe hai ki vikram lander kii landing main gadabadi kahaan hui, kaise hui or kyon hui? iske liye isro ke vaigyanikon ne lanbaa-chaudaa data khangaalana shuru kar diya he
 ISRO scientists are studying Vikram Lander's telemetric data, signal, software, hardware, liquid engine in detail to find the answer to this question
 antim 20 minute kaa datavikram kii landing aakhri palon main gadabad hui
 This problem started when Vikram Lander was just 2 from the moon's surface
 1 kilometre upar tha
 Now scientists are analyzing the telemetric data of descent trajectory
 report ke mutabik har sab-system ke parformens data main kuch raaj chipa ho saktaa he
 Here the mention of liquid engine is very important
 vikram lander kii landing main iskaa ahm role rahaa he
 The last signal scientists from the lander are investigating those signals or emission signals to detect some disturbances
 isamen software kii samasya, hardware kii kharabi shaamil ho sakati he
 2 of the last in it
 1 kilometre ke aankade zyada mahatv hai
 Datavikram lander, downloaded from the sensor, has sent several data to the command center when it was trying to land on the lunar surface
 inamen chand ke sataha kii tasviir samet kai duusare data shaamil hai
 isro's team is working on this
 sampark kii koshish jariesro ke vaigyanik is baat kii lagaataar koshish kar rahe hai ki lander se sampark sthapit kiya ja sake
 Scientists believe that if Vikram had crashed the land, his equipment would have been damaged, but if the orbiter tried to contact the lander in the right direction, contact could be established
 landig aria kii maspingorbitor main aise upkaran he ki jinke paas chand ke sataha ko maapne, tasviren khinchne kii kshamta he
 If the orbiter sends any such picture, information about the lander can be found
 aantarik chook yaa bahari tatvaisaro vikram lander kii landing main ai khami kaa pataa karne ke liye har pahalu kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 isro's team is now investigating whether any internal defaults have occurred or whether any external elements are at hand
 duusari agenciyon se madadduniya bhar kii spes agenciyon kii nigaah chandrayan-2 kii landing par thi
 Therefore, ISRO may also consider that necessary sensor data associated with Vikram lander be taken from other agencies, such as space station, telescope, to find the location of Vikram lander
 isro ab is baat kaa adhyayan kar rahaa he ki kya vikram kii landing ke aakhri phej main kuch parformens visangati (divergences) ai he
 Because when the lander 2 from the lunar surface
 1 kimi dur tha tab tak lander kii inhen mashiinon ne sateek kaam kiya tha

 BJP MLA Surendra Singh, who is often in the discussion due to his controversial statements, has made a controversial statement this time about BSP supremo Mayawati
 surendra singh ne kaha, ab mayawati ko 'mukhyamantri banane ke liye aglaa janm lenaa hoga
 He said, "she (mayawati) became the Chief Minister thrice because of BJP and now opposing BJP has become her way of life
 yadi bhaajapa ne unhen samarthan nahin diya hota to vah kabhi mukhyamantri nahin banatin
 He will now have to take a second birth to become the chief minister
 ' surendra singh yaheen nahin ruke
 He also targeted the interim president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi, saying that she had no knowledge of 'raj Dharma' and the people of the country had already rejected her
 aapako bataa den ki kuch dinon pehle hi surendra singh ne ek vivaadit bayaan diya tha or unhone kaha tha ki muslim kai patniyaan rakhte hai or unke bachche jaanavar pravriti ke hote hai
 Not only this, he has called doctors 'demons' and journalists as 'brokers'
 hindu dharm bachaane ke liye vidhayak ne hinduon se adhik bachche paidaa karne kaa aagrah bhi kar chuke hai
 However, the BJP has consistently ignored his statements
 beete dinon hi uttar pradesh ke baliya se vidhayak surendra singh ne pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki, 'agar mamata banerjee bangladeshiyon ko rakhkar raajnneeti karnaa chaahati hai to unhen bangladesh kaa pradhanmantri ban janaa chahie
 
 
 If you dare
 ' surendra singh ne kaha, ham yah kabhi sweekaar nahin karenge ki bharat main sharnaarthiyon kii tarah rahane vaale videshi yahaan kii raajnneeti ko prabhavit karen
 Surendra Singh did not stop here
 unhone aage kaha, 'mamata banerjee bhartiya hai, isaliye ve yahaan rah sakati hai, lekin agar ve desh virdohi bhaawanaaon se prabhavit hoti hai to unhen sabak sikhaaya ja saktaa he, jis tarah pi chidambaram or dusron ko sikhaaya ja rahaa he
 (also input from IANS) pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko apane sansadeey kshetra kaashi ko kai yojanaon kii saugat dete hue apane dream project kaashi vishwanath coridor kii neenv rakhi
 On this occasion, the Prime Minister said that Baba Vishwanath was tied for years, could not even breathe, but today he will get freedom from this work
 unhone kaha ki jab main raajnneeti main nahin tha, tab bhi sochataa tha ki yahaan kuch karnaa chahie
 But it was written in my fate that this work was done by my hand
 karodon logon kii aasthaa ke centre kaashi vishwanath ko mukt karne ke piem ke is bayaan par kaashi ke vidwat janon main rosh he
 In order to make Kashi Kyoto, more than two hundred buildings were acquired and demolished from Lalita Ghat to Vishwanath Temple for expansion of Kashi Vishwanath Temple
 inamen lagbhag 50 kii sankhya main pracheen mandir va math shaamil hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he has also liberated more than 40 ancient temples on which people had encroached
 sankatmochan mandir ke mahant vishambharnath mishra ne aajtak
 Talking to in, said, 'lord Shankar is going to liberate everyone, so it is unfair to talk about liberating him
 isse main behad aahat hum
 The building of development is being demolished on the living awakening culture of Banaras
 yah lakhon logon kii aasthaa se khilwaad he
 Swami Avimukteshwaranand, a disciple of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda, who had been agitating for the protection of these ancient temples, the Deities, who came under the auspices of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, said, "aurangzeb did not break as many temples were destroyed for the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor
 
 agar pradhanmantri kaa arth he ki mainen inhen mukt karaayaa to sahi hi he kyonki unhone in dev vigrahon ko unke praan se mukt kara diya
 Tell the Prime Minister, who was freed from his possession? What has happened in Kashi is unthinkable
 jin devi devataaon ke darshan ke liye log puure bharat se aate hai ve unhen naa paakar kaisaa mahasoos karenge
 'general Secretary Deepak Malviya, organization of Kashi Vidhyat Parishad, says that Baba Vishwanath has special importance in the two Jyotirlingas of the country
 wo puure vishwa ke nath hai
 People from all over the country come to Kashi to attain liberation
 to inhen koun mukt karegaa jo khud logon ko mukti dete hai, kaashi moksh kaa kaarak he
 Beautification can be done around Baba Vishwanath, facilities can be increased but it is improper to say that Baba is liberated
 deepak malviya ne kaha ki kaashi vishwanath coridor ke nirmaan ke liye jin mandiron or dev vigrahon ko todaa gaya use jameendoj kar uske upar nirmaan karnaa anuchit prakriya he
 Because all these deities were consecrated
 agar sarkaar sundarikaran kar rahi he to inhen pun: praan pratishthit karaate hue darshan pujan kii uchit vyavastha kare
 The area falling under the auspices of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is called Pakka Mahal in Benaras
 yah kshetra ganga tat par assi se rajghat tak failaa he
 This region of Banaras itself holds many cultures
 alag-alag rajyon ke riyasaton kii pracheen imaarat va vahaan puuje jane vaale puranic mandir or dev vigrah isi kshetra main sthit hai
 People come from all over the country to visit
 pakkaa mahal main bengali, nepali, gujarati, dakshin bhartiya samudaayon ke apane apane mohalle hai or inase jude devi devataaon ke mandir hai

 com / kbw3xtaozx desh bhar main ho rahi reliyon main ghante-ghante bhar bolne vaale narendra modi party kii ahm baithkon main chup rahete hai
 
 
 The Bharatiya Janata Party's Central Election Committee has held three meetings so far to select candidates for the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, but in the selection of candidates for most of the seats, Narendra Modi neither gave his opinion nor interfered in the decision
 
 
 party ke ummidavaaron ke chayan main rajya ikaayiyon kii raay ko sabase zyaada tarjeeh di ja rahi he
 
 
 This has rarely happened when Modi has said something about a particular seat or a particular candidate
 
 
 din-dinabhar chalane vaali baithkon main modi ke alaava laalkrishna adwani or arun jetali bhi zyaada samay chup hi rahete hai
 
 
 Party leaders who know Narendra Modi closely say that Narendra Modi believes only in speaking less in the process of internal decisions of the party
 
 
 samay se pehle apane pattey na kholana, modi kii kaaryastylee kaa ek mahatvapurn lakshan he
 
 
 He also does not give anyone a chance to guess his thinking
 
 
 unke khud chunaav ladane kaa faisla bhi aisa hi ek bada kadam he, jiske bare main vahi faisla karenge or iskaa elaan bhi aakhri vakt tak rokkar rakhenge
 
 
 Whether it is the Prime Ministerial candidate from the party and the important process of selection of the candidates is a major step in the way of fulfilling this ambition, but Narendra Modi does not want to interfere in it, and it is being said that Is part of a well thought out strategy
 
 
 darasal, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke sheersh netritv main bijepi ke kendriya netaaon ke prati ek vishesh kism kaa avishvaas ghar kar gaya he
 
 
 In the last 10 years since the bjp's debacle in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the party has been busy with mutual conflicts for most of the time
 
 
 duusari peedi ke netaaon ko aapas main jhagadne se fursat nahin mili or party ke sabase bade netaa hone ke baavjood laalkrishna adwani in jhagadon ko sulajhane ke sthaan par inhen main se ek kheme ke saath nazar aane lage
 
 
 This is the reason that to reduce the influence of these leaders from the party, the RSS first assigned the party command to an outsider Nitin Gadkari and now made Narendra Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate
 
 
 vaise, narendra modi dilli kii satta ke galiyaaron se aparichit nahin hai
 
 
 While the organization's General Secretary, he has seen closely the difficulties of Hastinapur
 
 
 vah is baat se bhi anjaan nahin ki unki ummidavaari se party ke kai netaa khush nahin hai
 
 
 He also knows that many leaders are still hoping that if BJP gets close to 170 seats, someone else can become Prime Minister instead of Modi
 
 
 narendra modi ko yah andaaza bhi he ki gathbandhan or ummidavaaron ke faislon main kis tarah jaan-boojhkar party ke bheetar hi taang adai ja rahi he, taaki 200 siten paar karne ke bijepi kaa makasad puraa na ho sake
 
 
 Murali Manohar Joshi is angry that no one has told him that Narendra Modi wants to contest from Benaras and he vacates the seat for him to Kanpur
 
 
 lalji tandon is baat se naaraaz hai ki unhen koi yah kehane nahin aayaa ki rajnath singh lakhanu aana chaahate hai
 
 
 Kailash Joshi is inviting Advani to fight from there to save his Bhopal seat
 
 
 sabko ummid thi ki narendra modi unase kahenge, lekin aisa nahin hua
 
 
 And Modi remained silent
 
 
 darasal, narendra modi sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat khud ko dilli ke netaaon se dur rakh rahe hai
 
 
 Modi believes that there is only one recipe for the BJP to achieve the best, and that is direct communication with the public
 
 
 11, ashok road par baithe rahane se yah kamyaabi nahin mil sakati
 
 
 Narendra Modi says that no one else will come between him and the common people
 
 
 mahatvapurn muddon par vah apni raay party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko bataa dete hai, lekin sab kuch unki ichha ke mutabik hi ho, yaa ho rahaa he, aisa sandesh vah nahin dena chaahate
 
 
 Even as Narendra Modi's prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi is being considered as the 'first among equals' (first among equals), but if he becomes prime minister, he will become the supreme leader of the party
 
 
 tab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki vah party ke andruni maamalon par chup hi rahenge yaa party forum par khulkar apni baat rakhenge
 
 
 On the one hand, there are reports of India's hosting of the Olympics in 2024, on the other hand, only the top officials of the Indian Olympic Association are not aware of the possible visit of the President of the International Olympic Association to India
 bhartiya olympic sanghake koshadhyaksh anil khanna ne is babat ek patr likhakar jaankaree maangi he
 Anil Khanna has written in his letter that he came to know through newspapers that the President of the International Olympic Association is coming to India on 27 April
 unhone aage likhaa he ki general secommetry rajeev mehta ko bhi is baat kii jaankaree nahin he
 It is worth noting that for the last few days, there were continuous reports that India would be claiming for the Olympics in 2024
 antarrashtriya olympic sangh ke adhyaksh ke bharat aane or pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane kii bhi charchaa he
 But the Indian Olympic Association is not aware of this incident
 aise main yah samajha hi ja saktaa he ki olympic ke aayojan kii daavedaari ko lekar bhartiya olympic sangh kitna gambhir he
 Seat-sharing formula between congress-ncp: Political strength of congress-ncp in Maharashtra, seat is not fixed between bjp-bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan milakar chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya he to congress-ensipi ke bich bhi siton ke bantwaare ko lekar manthan shuru ho gaya he
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar met Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday
 mana ja rahaa he ki is dauraan donon netaaon ke bich gathbandhan kii baarikiyon or seat shering par charchaa hui
 In such a situation, the question is whether the congress-ncp will be able to compete with the bjp-shiv Sena alliance together
 maharashtra kii kul 288 vidhansabha siton main se 215 siton ke bantwaare par congress-ensipi ke bich sahmati ban pai he
 In this, the Congress will contest 111 and NCP 104 seats
 baaki 73 siton ko lekar maamla fansaa hua he, jinhen jald sulajhaa lene kii baat donon dalon kii ore se kii ja rahi he
 Let me tell you that the congress-ncp fought separately in the 2014 assembly elections, which both had to bear the brunt
 is chunaav main bijepi or shivasena bhi alag-alag lade the
 BJP has the highest number of 27 out of 288 assembly seats
 8 fisadi vot ke saath 122 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Shiv Sena 19
 3 fisadi vot ke saath 63 siten jiti thim
 Whereas Congress had 42 seats with 18 per cent votes and NCP 17
 2 fisadi vot ke saath 41 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 In such a situation, if you combine the vote of Congress and NCP, then it is close to 35 percent
 jabaki bijepi or shivasena ke vot milakar 47 fisadi ke kareeb hota he
 In this way, if both the coalitions enter the elections, then the bjp-shiv Sena alliance will look very heavy on the congress-ncp
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main bijepi main lambey samay tak senior partner kii bhoomika rahi shivasena 2014 se gathbandhan main junior partner kii haisiyat se kaam kar rahi he
 BJP wants to remain in the same role in this election, under which it wants to give less seats to the Shiv Sena
 vahiin, shivasena 50-50 seat formule par hi sahmati kii baat doharaa rahi he
 Apart from this, she is now publicly talking about claiming the chief minister's chair after performing well with the BJP in the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections
 aise main agar bijepi or shivasena ke bich seat shering ko lekar kisi tarah se sahmati nahin ban paati or congress-ensipi saath milakar chunavi ran main utarate hai to muqabla kaaphi dilachasp ho saktaa he
 However, after the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, BJP is leading
 iske alaava jis tarah ensipi or congress netaaon ne bijepi jwine kii he usase party ke hausale kaaphi buland hai
 Looking at the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP seems to be on the front foot
 darasal 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad bijepi or shivasena main sarkaar banane ko lekar sahmati banane main deree hone kii vajah se kayaas lagaae jane lage the ki ensipi bijepi ke saath ja sakati he
 This was the reason that BJP included Shiv Sena in the alliance on its own terms
 haalanki is baar ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ensipi ke bijepi ke saath jane kii sambhaavnaaon ko khud bijepi ke netaa khaarij kar rahe hai
 In the last few days, some big leaders of NCP have left Sharad Pawar and joined BJP
 aise main nahin lagata ki nikat bhavishya main sharad pavaar bijepi se kisi gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar honge
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who received praise on behalf of Anna Hazare, a veteran of Maharashtra, who waged a movement against corruption, expressed gratitude to him and said that it gives him courage to work further
 janata darbar main mukhyamantri kaarykram se itar nitish ne kaha ki isse aage kaam karne ke liye prerana milti he
 However, Nitish Kumar declined to comment on Hazare's praise of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 janpratinidhiyon ko waapas bulaane ke adhikaar par kanoon banane ke liye anna hajaare kii maang kaa samarthan karte hue nitish ne kaha ki yah to jaiprakash andolan kii mukhya maang thi jise janata sarkaar ne avyaavhaarik qaraar de diya tha
 This demand has arisen again after 30 years, it should be discussed
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main janata saarvbhaum he, jab janpratinidhi apeksha par khare nahin utarate to unhen hataane ke liye is prakaar ke kanoon kii darkaar he
 Democracy of our country is maturing, so this type of demand is arising
 nitish ne kaha ki bihar sarkaar ne apni seemaa ke daayre main sthaneey nagar nikaayon main aisa adhikaar dene ke liye vidheyak vidhanmandal ke donon sadanon se paarit karaayaa he
 The Chief Minister said that no matter what happens, wherever he is, he should take initiative against corruption in his own way
 This is the need of the hour
 bihar sarkaar ne vishesh nyaayalay kanoon lagu karakar or lok sevaaon kaa adhikaar vidheyak paarit karakar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf thos shuruuaat kii he
 He said that the Right to Public Services Act will be implemented by 15 August
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf desh kii janata mukhar ho chuki he
 The media has also considered it a major issue
 centre kii raajnneeti main jane ke sawaal par nitish ne kaha ki janata ne bihar kaa vikaas karne ke liye bahumat diya he, centre main jane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Senior Congress leader, strategist and former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said that the BJP is doing communal polarization at a frightening level in the poll-bound states and it is a big challenge for the Congress
 ramesh ne kaha ki har amit shah (bhaajapa adhyaksh) par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke 10 amit shah parde ke peeche rahakar dhruvikaran ke kaam main lage hue hai
 Speaking to the language of the news agency, the Congress leader said that the new name of dictatorship is Amit Shah and Narendra Modi does not behave like the Prime Minister during the election campaign
 unhone kaha ki modi itihaas ko galat tareeke se pesh karte hai or apane raajnneetik pratidwandiyon ke liye abhadra bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai
 The Congress leader also said that fake news has become the biggest business in the Modi government's Make in India program
 unhone bhaajapa par gaiyr-jaruri muddon ko mudda banane ke aarope bhi lagaae
 Ramesh said that the BJP is doing more and more communal polarization in every election and this is being done in these states as well
 congresaneta ne uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ko mili ‘prachand’ jeet ke liye bhi sampradayik dhruvikaran ko jimmedaar qaraar diya
 He said, 'the only explanation i have for the bjp's victory in Uttar Pradesh is that it was a communal polarization of horrific levels which they are doing in these states too
 ve chhattisgarh main yah kar rahe hai or nishchit taur par madhya pradesh or rajasthan main bhi kar rahe hai
 Congress leader said - BJP, which is doing communal polarization in two ways, member of core group formed by Congress to prepare for 2019 Lok Sabha elections, said BJP is doing two types of communal polarization across the country
 ek to khuleam dhruvikaran kiya ja rahaa he, jo amit shah or piem narendra modi kii bhashaa he
 Apart from this, the RSS and its people are polarizing with the tongue and going from house to house
 parde ke pich se ho rahe dhruvikaran kii gambhirtha nahin samaj rahaa vipakshah rameshbijapi adhyaksh par tanj kasate hue ramesh ne kaha, 'amit shahus vyakti ke achche udhaaharan hai, jo kathani or kerani main khulkar dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti karte hai
 Every Amit Shah has 10 Amit Shah of the RSS, who are behind the scenes engaged in polarization work
 uttar pradesh main bhi yahi hua tha
 The Congress leader said that the opposition is not paying attention to the polarization being done openly and also does not understand the seriousness of this polarization being done behind the scenes
 'congress or aresas ke bich chalegi lambii ladaai'yah puche jane par ki kya congress dhruvikaran ke mudde se nipatane main kaamyaab rahi he, is par ramesh ne kaha, 'yah bahut badi chunauti he
 It is not just an election challenge
 chaahe satta main rahen yaa satta se baahar, hamen is chunauti kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Describing the Congress's fight with the RSS as "long-lasting", Ramesh said, "it is not an immediate end
" yah lambii chalane vaali ladaai he
 'rahul has shown sternly on the ridiculous statements of Congress leaders, he said that it has taken years and decades to get hold of Kiko tribal areas
 jab unase poocha gaya ki seepi joshi jaise congress netaa vivaadit bayaan kyon de rahe hai, to ramesh ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is par kaaphi sakhti dikhaai he
 Calling the BJP responsible for making these statements an issue, Ramesh said, "the BJP specializes in making non-essential issues an issue and manipulating the news
 mek in india he mek in bijepi: rameshramesh ne kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki mek in india, mek in bijepi he
 In the BJP regime, fake news has become the biggest business under Make in India
 sach to yah he ki apane chunavi abhiyaanon main modi khud galat tathy pesh karte hai or galat itihaas bataate hai
 The former Union Minister said that he does not speak like the Prime Minister in his election campaigns
 aakhirkaar pradhanmantri to pradhanmantri hota he
 Regardless of the person, the post of PM should be respected

 The main contest is between the Congress and the BJP in the elections
 voting ke liye sava saat hajaar matdaan centre banaae gaye hai
 The election is a litmus test for veterans like Prem Kumar Dhumal and Virbhadra Singh who tried to woo voters in their own way
 congress ne jahaan apane chunaav prachaar main satta virdohi lahar paidaa karne kii koshish kii, vahiin sattarudh bhaajapa ne mahangaai or bhrashtachar ko mudda banaakar apni puri takat jhonk di
 The BJP and Congress are contesting all 68 seats, while the BSP has fielded candidates in 66 seats
 himachal lokhit party (36), trinmul congress (25), sapa (16), makapa (15), rakanpa (12), swabhimaan party (12), bhakpa (7) or shivasena chaar siton par chunaav lard rahi he

 Akali in Punjab
 
 The BJP alliance came to power for the second time in a row, contrary to historical practice
 kaaphi had tak punjab kii tarah hi himachal main bhi 1977 se kabhi kisi dal kii lagaataar duusari baar sarkaar nahin bani
 The election of November 4 will prove whether the BJP makes history or the Congress repeats Uttarakhand

 7253 polling stations have been set up for the election
 sabase unchaa matdaan centre 15 hajaar foot kii unchai par lahaul spiti ke hikkim main sthapit kiya gaya he
 The counting of votes will take place on December 20

 Independents won three seats and the BSP was able to capture only one seat
 bhaajapa or congress
 
 donon hi khemon ke liye rajya main bhrashtachar ek bada chunavi mudda he
 The Congress is facing serious charges due to scams like coal, 2G and Commonwealth Games
 haalanki, samooche chunaav prachaar main bhrashtachar ke aarope bada mudda bane rahe, lekin congress ne dhamul or unke mantrimandal sahakarmiyon par javaabi hamalaa kar inke prabhaav ko kam karne kii koshish kii
 Virbhadra Singh has publicly accused Dhumal that he gave away valuable land to special people at low prices
 bhrashtachar ke mudde par virbhadra ke khilaaf bhaajapa kaa aakraamak waar us samay kuch kund pad gaya jab party adhyaksh nitin gadakari par bhi aarope lag gaye
 As of yesterday, the issue of inflation has emerged as the strongest issue
 bhaajapa netritav ne gharelu gas or dijal ke daamon main vruddhi ko congress ke khilaaf shashakt hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kiya or matadaataaon se kaha ki aise main unke ghar kaa kharch kaise chalegaa
 In Himachal where the rail network is negligible, diesel is the lifeline of economy and LPG gas is also very important in the absence of alternative fuels at home
 dhumal ne congress nit centre sarkaar dwaara sabsidi vaale silendaron kii sankhya ghataae jane par induction chulhaa pesh kar 22

 sthaneey congress netaaon ko iske chalate aakhri kshanon main alpiji ke daamon main ek or vruddhi ko waapas lene ke liye centre par dabaav bananaa padaa 
 Satya Sharma, a resident of Amboya village in Sirmaur district, said, “inflation is breaking us badly and the budget of our house is going to be messed up by reducing the number of subsidized cylinders
 ’ bhaajapa ke baagiyon dwaara banaai gai himachal lokhit party ne ladaai ko rochak bana diya he
 Rebels can affect 22 of the 68 seats
 2007 ke chunaavon main bhi aisa hi hua tha jab 22 siton par jeet kaa faasla dhai hajaar se kam maton kaa tha 
 The winning margin of 40 seats was less than five thousand votes

 The presence of a third force, BSP, NCP and Trinamool Congress as Himachal Lokhit Party will also impact the results

 bade shaharon or mahanagaron kii tarah bundelkhand main bhi karvaa chouth kii khub dhooma rahi
 In Bundelkhand, women celebrated the festival of Karva Chauth somewhat differently
 karwachouth kaa vrath bhartiya mahilaayein apane pati kii dderghaayu ke liye rahati hai
 In Bundelkhand, women not only kept the fast of Karvachauth for the long life of their husbands, but also took a promise from their husbands that their husbands' lives would not be threatened
 patniyon ne apane patiyon ko anmol uphaar bhi diya
 On this occasion, women here pledged to their husbands to wear helmets while driving two-wheelers
 karvaa chouth ke din mahilaon ne aaajeevan saubhagyawati rahane kii kaamana kii or aasmaan main chand dikhne par vrath todaa
 In groups everywhere, women celebrated Karva Chauth, Alam was that the patriarch and wife were seen in pairs on the upper floor of every big building, while the night went on till the aarti taking off and watching the moon and husband's face with a sieve
 samasyaon ke liye pahachaane jane vaale bundelkhand main ravivaar ko raunak niraali rahi
 In Jhansi, women celebrated Karva Chauth in groups at many places
 saamaajik sanghathan jesiai (kohenur) ne mahilaon ke bich karvaa chouth manaaya
 Social worker Vaishali Punshi says, "this time on Karva Chauth, all of us women have only asked our husbands to wear helmets whenever they drive two wheelers
 iske liye unhen bataur uphaar helmet bhi diya kyonki vaahan chalaate samay suraksha jaruri he
 That is why they say that if there is life, there is a world
 "isi tarah urai, hamirpur, banda, tikamgarh, chhatarpur aadi sthanon par bhi karvaa chouth kii dhooma rahi
 In Chhatarpur, women worshiped in homes and temples by fasting throughout the day and wished to remain their lifelong good luck with their husband's long life

 There was a lot of furore over the coal scam, the government was very angry, the opposition made a lot of noise
 yahaan tak kii supreme court ne bhi sawaal khadey kiye lekin in sabase sarkaar or congress par koi fark nahin padataa, kyonki sarkaar ko bharosa he ki janata sab bhul jaaegi
 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has said that let the coal be voila, it was a matter of day before yesterday, Bofors was there, don't you remember, we forgot
 vaisaa hi koyale kaa he, thode din haath kaale, dhoe ki dobaaraa haath saafe
 Shinde's statement in Pune came after the IMG recommended the cancellation of three more coal mines
 jin kol block ke aavanton radd karne kii sifarish kii gai he wo hai, gaurangdih abisi kol block jo himachal iemti power limited or jeesdblyoo steel limited ko aavantit kiya gaya tha
 Ravanwara North Coal Block which was allotted to SKS Ispat & Power Limited
 new patrapaada kol block jo bhushan steel limited ke naam aavantit kiya tha
 As time goes on, the layers of coal scam are being opened up, but the Home Minister is confidently saying that it is public and will be forgotten
 scindia sahab kaa ye bayaan sunakar vipaksh ke un aaropon main dam najar aata he ki sarkaar jaanati he ki janata kaa dhyaan kaise bhatkaana he
 However, Shinde's statement makes it clear that the government does not care about the storm in the coal scam

 After receiving such information and publishing the news, it has become an embarrassment for Mamata Banerjee
 vahiin, party ke netaaon ne jahaan rail mantri dinesh trivedi par dhokhadhadi kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The Trinamool Congress on Saturday explicitly told Trivedi that he should resign from the post but Trivedi also took a tough stand and demanded a written instruction from party chief Mamata Banerjee
 trivedi ne bhale hi kaha ho ki yadi unhen likhit main pad chhodane ke liye aadesh mili yaa pradhanmantri manmohan singh kahen to vah apana istipha de denge, lekin loksabhaa main trinmul congress ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne saaf kar diya ki party likhit main koi aadesh nahin degi

 In this, Mulayam Singh Yadav will contest from his traditional seat Mainpuri
 jabaki mulaayam ke bhattije dharmendra yadav badaayun, firozabad se akshay yadav, itawa (surakshit seat) kamalesh katheria, baharich (surakshit seat) shabbir valmiki or rabartsganj (surakshit seat) se bhailal kol ke naamon kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Shivpal Singh Yadav, president of the outspoken Samajwadi Party, who is an uncle-nephew, has announced to contest from Firozabad due to political insurgency from SP General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav
 jabaki sapa ne is seat par ek baar phir apane maujuuda saasand akshay yadav ko chunaav ladaane kaa elaan kiya he
 In such a situation, there will be a fight between uncle and nephew on Firozabad seat
 ramgopal-shivpal main adaavatabata den ki shivpal or ramgopal ke bich beete dhai saal se talkhi badi he
 Even before the split in the SP, political enmity between the two had increased

 After forming the SP-BSP alliance, Ram Gopal Yadav has fielded his son from Firozabad
 lekin jis tarah se firozbad main yadav samudaay ke bich shivpal yadav ne apni pakad banaai he
 Hariom Yadav, MLA from Sirsaganj in Firozabad and Samadhi of Mulayam Singh Yadav, is also raising the flag of revolt against Ram Gopal and is seen standing with Shivpal
 itnaa hi nahin sapa purv vidhayak mohammad azim bhi shivpal ke saath hai
 The road to Firozabad is not easy: Akshay Yadav's path from Firozabad seat is not easy
 2014 ke chunaav main akshay yadav bijepi ummidavaar espi singh baghel se 1,14,059 vot se jeet hasil kar sake the
 But this time, due to Shivpal's beat, his path seems even more difficult

 They also revolted and are with Shivpal

 At the same time, it is also clear that the company is fully aware of this and is trying to deal with this problem, but in spite of this the company has neither worked to provide any information to the regulator nor the customers
 riter ne daawa kiya he ki in dashakon ke dauraan baby powder main kam maatra main esbestas paaya gaya he

 On the second day of Agenda Aaj Tak, a discussion on Digital India and Cashless India was held in the "telecom Revolution" session
 is charchaa kaa sanchaalan anjana om kashyap ne kiya
 The session was attended by Anupam Shrivastava, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL)
 anupam shrivastav ne kaha ki desh main telecom kranti campatishan ke daur aage nikal chuki he
 Now all companies in the sector need to promote competition as well as mutual cooperation
 pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara desh main cashles vyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon par bolte hue anupam ne kaha ki yah bahut hi mahatvakanshi yojana he
 Currently, a big leap is being made in the direction of cashless transactions using smart phones in the country
 lekin is disha main vaastavik laabh tab milegaa jab gramin bharat is vyavastha se puri tarah jud jayega
 Anupan said that BSNL has chosen rural India as its focal point for realizing the dream of Central Government Digital India and cashless transactions
 beasenel bahut jald mobicash naam se seva shuru karne ja rahaa he jisase ek saadhaaran phone se bhi tranjaction karnaa sambhav ho jayega
 This is the biggest step towards creating a cashless India as it can easily connect people living in far flung areas
 shrivastav ne kaha ki kuch samay pehle tak beasenel bhi sarkaar ke kisi takniki vibhaag se adhik nahin tha
 But now the situation is changing rapidly
 yah badlaav khud karmchaariyon kii pahal par aa rahaa he
 Now bsnl's moto is Service with Smile
 iske tahat ab beasenel kaa prayek karmchaaree di ja rahi suvidhaon ko behatar karne main apana puraa yogadan karata he
 Under this, it is tried that the customers do not face any problem in forming a relationship with BSNL
 beete kuch maheenon main beasenel main bada badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 This change came about during the financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16 when the company moved out of losses and started to move towards profitability
 isi badlaav ke chalate ek baar phir desh ke telecom sector main log beasenel ko pahchaanane lage hai
 On not being involved in the recent 4G spectrum sharing, Anupam said that in fact BSNL is working on a strategy separate from this spectrum
 unhone bataaya ki hamaari stretage graahakon ko tej se tej speed par data muhaiyaa karaane kii he
 For this, we have chosen the way of broadband connection with the help of wifi hotspot instead of 4G
 beete kuch maheenon main beasenel ne desh ke doordaraj ilaakon main 4000 se upar wifai hotspot network taiyaar kiya he or alge do saal ke dauraan ise 40,000 hotspot tak pahunchane kii taiyaari he
 Once this network is ready, BSNL services will be better than spectrum services in any case
 iske alaava haal main laanch hue reliance jeeyo setelecom sectorco mil rahi chunauti par bolte hue anupam ne kaha ki unhen pehle ye andeshaa tha ki reliance jeeyo kii lanchig ke baad unka data sarvice feekaa pad jayega
 However, he claimed that bsnl's data service continues to grow
 anupam ne bataaya ki telecom sector main ab nayaa mantra he
 Along with competition, collaboration has become extremely important here
 isse sabhi telecom companiyon ko phayda pahonchega hi saath hi saath kol drops or connactivity kii shikayaton ko dur karne main bhi badi kamyaabi haath lagegi
 Speaking on Cashless India once again, Anupam said that in an effort to prepare rural India for this, he has taken the initiative to connect 80 thousand panchayats of the country with bharatnet
 is koshish main usne abhitak 60 hajaar panchayaton ko jodne kaa kaam puraa kar liya he
 With this exercise, internet facility has been extended to these panchayats and they can move towards cashless transactions

 bharat-paak match ke dauraan mahaj 10 second ke vigyaapan ke liye vigyapankartaaon ko 25 lakh rupee chukaane honge
 From the number of times an advertisement appears during the entire match, guess how much money is going to be spent during the indo-pak match alone

 This is because even the broadcaster knows that when India encounters Pakistan, people get obsessed
 jin logon kii cricket main khaas dilchaspee nahin bhi hoti he wo bhibharat-paak machake dauraan tivi se chipak jate hai
 That is, while for India Pak matches, Rs

 5 lakhs

 This time in the indo-pak match, Ed is worth Rs 25 lakh
 lekin pichhali baar jab in donon kaa muqabla semifinal level main hua tha, tab isaki keemat 20 lakh rupee thi
 Then what is the reason this time that the price has been increased by five lakhs for the first match of these two rivals?

 maharashtra main mukhyamantri kii kursi paane kii daud main peeche chhot gaye netaa narayan rane ke samarthakon or congressi kaaryakartaaon ke bich marpet hui
 Slogans were raised on both sides in front of the office near the party's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminal and there was an uproar for a long time
 is bich rane ke putr ne pradesh yuva congress ke mahasachiv pad se istipha de diya he
 In view of the changing political situation, his resignation had remained a mere formality
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ke ulanghan par supreme court main daakhil kii gai yachika khaarij kar di gai he
 This petition was filed by Sushmita Deb of Congress
 adaalat kaa kahana he ki chunaav ayog ne is maamle main faisla kar diya he isliye yachika beasar hoti he or khaarij kar di jaati he
 The Supreme Court has said that if you have objection to the decision of the Election Commission, then a new petition can be filed
 chunaav ayog ne apane jawaab main kaha tha ki hamaare paas jo shikaayat ai thi vah congress ke naam se ai thi, naa ki sushmita dev ke naam se
 What was the allegation? Actually, Congress MP Sushmita Dev had claimed in the Supreme Court that the Election Commission had failed to assess the alleged hate speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 unhone kaha ki aise bhaashanon ke kaaran dharmik aadhaar par nafrat kii bhaavana fail rahi he
 He also said that despite the refusal, the armed forces were used in the speeches
 lekin phir bhi chunaav ayog ne koi karrwai nahin kii
 Commenting on former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi during a rally, PM Narendra Modi called him a corrupt No

 is par congress ne unke khilaaf somvaar ko chunaav ayog main shikaayat darj karai thi, jisamen unhen mangalvaar ko clin chit mil gai
 Deo, Lok Sabha MP from Silchar in Assam and Chief of the Indian Women's Congress, said that the way the Election Commission gave a decisive order is clearly a violation of the law set by the court
 unhone kaha ki piem ke aachaar samhita ulanghan maamle main ek chunaav ayukta ne asahmati jataai thi, lekin aadesh ke saath yah nahin bataaya gaya
 Dev's lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi contended that the argument for dismissing the complaints of code of conduct against Modi and Amit Ah is very strange
 unhone kaha ki aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kii shikaayat kaa nipataara karne ke liye supreme court ko disha-nirdesh tay karnaa chahie kyonki deree se sabhi partiyon ko samaan avasar nahin mil paaenge
 Earlier, Dev had also filed an affidavit in the Election Commission, in which he said that the statements of PM Modi and Amit Shah are also similar to those of Yogi Adityanath and Mayawati
 donon netaaon ke khilaaf aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne par karrwai kii gai
 Whereas Modi and Shah got a clean chit
 unhone kaha ki pipuls act 1951 kaa ulanghan karne par chunaav ayog ko modi shah ke khilaaf ection lenaa chahie

 ’ kai baithkon kii ricard baatcheet ke mutabik, firdaus americanyon ko ‘allaah kaa dushman’ maanata tha or unako maar kar america par manovaigyanik dabaav bananaa chahta tha
 According to the affidavit, Firdaus wanted the US to be vigorously attacked in secret

 As the summer season started, scorching sun and hot winds have started to shatter the people
 taapmaana ke badhane se kai logon ko sehat or skin sambandhit samasyaayein sataane lagati hai
 In this case, it is very important to take special care of your diet, because diet directly affects health
 garmiyon main sehatmand rahane ke liye jitna jaruri bharpoor maatra main pani pinaa hota he, utana hi jaruri khaane-pine kii chizon kaa dhyaan rakhana bhi hota he
 Your diet plan should be prepared according to the weather
 ham aapako kuch aisi chizon ke bare main bataa rahe hai, jinhen garmiyon main khaane se bachanaa chahie
 Stay away from consuming these things during summer
 zyada masaaledaar chijen na khaaen-masaale khaane kaa swaad to badhaate hai, lekin ye logon kii sehat ko gambhir rup se nuksaanabhi pahunchaate hai
 Eating more spices causes irritation, stomach problems etc
 saath hi sharir kaa temparechar bhi badhata he
 2
 maansaahaari chizon kaa kam seven karen- garmiyon main jitna ho sake maansaahaari chizon kaa seven karne se bachein
 Consuming spicy gravy in hot weather also increases body temperature, which causes excessive sweating
 saath hi digestive system bhi disturb hota he
 3
 junk food-garmiyon main junk food khaane ke bajaae hari subjiyon kaa zyada se zyada seven karen
 Green vegetables provide essential nutrients to the body, which helps in keeping away from many diseases
 4
 Tea and Coffee - Most of us start the day with a cup of tea
 lekin chaay or coffee donon hi body temparechar ko badhaati hai
 The caffeine present in it dehydrates the body
 isliye garmiyaan shuru hote hi chaay or coffee se duuri bana len
 5
 cheez sos-cheez yun to zyaadaatar logon ko pasand hoti he, lekin garmiyon main cheez kaa kam se kam seven karnaa chahie
 Actually, cheese sauces have a very high calorie content
 vahiin, is mausam main sharir ko zyada nutrishan kii jarurat hoti he
 Therefore, include healthy things in the diet

 Naga Panchami has great importance in Hinduism
 manyataon ke anusaar is din mahilaayein naag devtaa ko apane bhai ke rup main puujati hai or manokamana puri karne ke liye prarthana karti hai
 This time the festival of Nag Panchami will be celebrated on 05 August
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai naag panchami kaa sidhaa sambandh aapaki kundali main virajman raahu-ketu se he
 Rahu and Ketu reside at 180 degrees from each other, that is, they both sit in the seventh house from each other
 rahu or ketu ko sarp kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Rahu is considered to be the head and Ketu is the tail
 sarp ke samaan hone ke kaaran rahu or ketu se sambandhit samasyaon ke liye naag panchami kaa din sarvshereshth he
 By taking remedies related to Rahu Ketu on this day in the afternoon, the problems related to these are eliminated
 kaise pahachaanen rahu ketu ke lakshan-- vyakti agar hameshaa jaldbaaji main rahata ho or uske jivan main tamaam ghatnaayen aakasmik rup se ghaten to samajhnaa chahie ki yah rahu ketu kaa prabhaav he
 - If the person shows interest in eating fast food instead of sattvic food, then it is also the effect of these
 - vyakti kaa sharir rukha rahata ho or vyakti ko hameshaa aalasy rahata he
 - The person always hides things and does everything secretly
 - vyakti kii hatheliyon main bichon bich jaal ho to bhi yah rahu ketu kaa hi prabhaav he
 What is the auspicious effect of Rahu Ketu? - If Rahu Ketu is auspicious, then the person succeeds in the field of computers
 - vyakti raajnneeti main safalataa praapt karata he
 - The person succeeds in the field of film art
 - vyakti kii tamaam durghatnaon se raksha hoti he, vyakti baar baar mushkilon se bachataa he
 - Traveling abroad, knowing many languages and going on the path of spirituality are the auspicious effects of Rahu Ketu
 rahu ketu kaa ashubh prabhaav kaise pahachaanen or iskaa prabhaav kya he ?- vyakti apni shaktiyon kaa durpyog karata he, galat sangati main pad jaataa he
 - Criminal tendencies occur within a person
 - vyakti ke andar bhay kii vritti hoti he or vyakti ko kalpana kii samasyaayein hoti hai
 - The person is more complicated
 - nirnay lene main mushkil, kapat karnaa or doharaa charitra rakhana rahu ketu kaa hi ashubh prabhaav he
 Get rid of the inauspicious effects of Rahu Ketu on Nag Panchami - If Rahu Ketu is spoiling the habit of eating and eating, then plant a basil plant on Nagpanchami and worship it
 - agar rahu ketu ke kaaran buree aadaten lag gai hon to naag panchami par praatah mitti kaa ek sarp banaakar nadi main pravaahit karen
 - If there are many ups and downs in life due to Rahu Ketu, then donate seven types of grains together on this day
 - agar bhay kii vritti yaa kalpana kii samasya ho to is din neem kii lakdi par 108 baar pili sarson kii aahuti den
 If there is any problem related to Rahu Ketu, then on Nag Panchami, tie a piece of white sandalwood in a blue cloth and wear it around your neck

 main to bas samay ke bahaav ke saath chalate hue kuch alag kaam karnaa chaahati thi, jo mere liye mjedaar bhi ho
 Due to this philosophy, today i am working in six countries of five continents, traveling 45 countries and the biggest thing is that i can see the diversity of the world closely
 dilli ke ladi shriram college se iconomics (onors) kii degree lene ke baad main videsh seva main janaa chaahati thi, lekin iske liye mujhe master kii degree lene kii jarurat thi
 i enrolled in MA at both Delhi School of Economics and Jawaharlal Nehru University, but took just a week of experience as i got admission in Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata and Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai
 us samay maine sochaa ki mumbai main rahanaa zyada mjedaar rahegaa, isliye jamanalaal bajaj institute main daakhila le liya
 Even then i had in mind that after taking a business degree, i will sit for the Foreign Service examination
 lekin padhai ke dauraan hi mujhe voltas main naukari mil gai
 Voltas gave me tremendous opportunity
 maine rasna ko bazaar main utaara, jisane mujhe turant badi safalataa dilaa di
 After a brief stint at Voltas, i moved to Cadbury, where, as a young brand manager, i had the opportunity to meet Sir Adrian Cadbury, the then Global Chairman, on his tour to India
 vah mere liye yaadgaar pal tha
 In 1982, while working at Cadbury, i received a scholarship from Rotary International to study abroad
 maine turant is avasar ko hathiyaa liya
 It was a great experience as a student in America
 maine neuyork main united neshans main internship kii
 i became friends with people from all over the world and got to know their experiences in Vietnam, South Africa, Cambodia etc
 kuch din baad cadabri ne euke main mujhe senior brands manager banane kaa prastaav diya
 i launched the first aerated chocolate Vispa
 ise turant hi baari safalataa mili
 At that time (1984–86) it was a rare thing for marketing people to work abroad
 main cadabri india se pehali vyakti thi, jo euke main kaam kar rahi thi
 Cadbury's importance to me was also for another reason
 isane mujhe nigeria or dakshin africa main kaam karne kaa avasar diya
 i was the head of the sales and marketing department there
 iske baad main coca-cola company main aa gai, jahaan main pehle global marketing diarector bani
 My second role in coca-cola was equally challenging
 mujhe latin america ke liye marketing kii vaais president, andian divijan kii divijan president aadi bana diya gaya tha
 Because of this, i had to live in Santiago and learn Spanish
 vahaan meraa alag tarah kii samskruti se parichay hua
 Then i returned to India in 2005 due to personal reasons
 yahaan aakar maine britania main job kar lee
 The experience here was also unique to me
 16 saal videsh main bitaane ke baad jab bharat lauti to sab kuch badal gaya tha
 India of 2005 had become a country full of confidence and expectations
 pichley aath varshon main or bhi badlaav aa gaya he
 Today there is a huge contradiction in the country

 There is a ruckus within the BJP to go to the Rajya Sabha
 anusuchit jati samudaay main gahari paith rakhane vaale bhushan laal jangade kaa kaarykaal isi maah khatm ho rahaa he

 aise main unki khaali ho rahi seat se isi varg ke ummidavaar ke tay kiye jane kii sambhaavna zyada dikhaai de rahi he
 Still all other leaders of the other class are confident that this time they will not be ignored
