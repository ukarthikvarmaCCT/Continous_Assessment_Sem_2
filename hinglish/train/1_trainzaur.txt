 The Pataliputra seat seems to have become a question of prestige for RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 is seat par lalu yadav ke liye apni beti misa bharti kii jeet kitna jaruri he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki lalu yadav shanivaar ko us shaks ke ghar ja pahunche jo pichley kai saalon se na sirf jail main band he balki jisaki pahchaan ek behad khatarnaak apradhi ke taur par hoti rahi he
 As soon as Ritlal Yadav, who was imprisoned against Misa Bharti from Pataliputra, announced his candidature, Lalu Yadav threatened to go to his Lashkar's house
 kareeb 45 minute tak reetlal ke pita or bhai se unhone band kamare main mantranaa kii
 Lalu wanted Ritlal not to contest against Misa
 kamare se baahar aakar unhone us pita ke gale main maala daal di, jiske bete ke naam se kabhi danapur ilaake kii ruh kaanpati thi
 It was the political compulsion of Lalu Yadav that pulled him to the door of Reetlal Yadav, who was once called the terror of Patna and Danapur, due to which even today there are stains of murder of many innocents, then kidnapping of many innocents and ransom But he is still behind bars in jail
 ek vakt tha jab wo patna police kii most wanted list main shaamil tha or police use jinda yaa murda dhund rahi thi
 But today Lalu Yadav came to his head on his frame
 vajah thi agar reetlal yadav chunaav main khadaa ho gaya to unki beti misa bharti ko milane vaale yadav voton main send lag jaaegi or tab ye ladaai kaaphi mushkil ho jaaegi
 After finishing meeting Ritlal Yadav's father, Lalu said that these are our old people, they have an old relationship, they have talked to them, they will decide the politics here, which will be according to them
 darasal ramkripal yadav ke maidan main taal thokane ke baad misa bharti kii ladaai kaaphi mushkil ho gai he
 In such a situation, Lalu cannot tolerate even a dent in his vote
 reetlal yadav aisa naam tha jo lalu yadav kii baat maanane ko taiyaar nahin tha or usne chunaav main utarane kaa elaan kar liya tha
 In such a situation, Lalu Yadav kept the principles for this fight of daughter and went to the house of that Ritlal Yadav
 lalu ne reetlal ke ghar par use nirdosh tak qaraar de diya, par mulakaaton ke baad bhi abtak reetlal ke parivaar ne ye khulkar nahin kaha ki wo chunaav nahin ladega
 Ritlal Yadav is considered to be a good hold on the voters in the area and especially Yadav voters and in the last assembly elections he had won more than 50 thousand independent votes, due to which the RJD lost badly in his stronghold, this time also on 27th
 Had announced to fill the form
 aise main lalu yadav bhi use manage karne kii jaldbaaji me the
 Lalu Yadav lost a big battle today on Reetlal Yadav Mane or Mane Mane
 ek baat saaf ho gai ki ab lalu yadav ab apni jati ke votaron par bhi wo prabhaav nahin rakhte jo kabhi sirf unka hua karata tha
 It has become clear that now politically bigger than Lalu, his community leaders have become criminals

 Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily has accused Air Force Chief BS Dhanoa of lying and suppressing the truth
 moili kaa yah bayaan dhanoa kii us tippanee ke ek din baad aayaa he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki rafel ek game changer vimaan he or saude ko lekar supreme court ne behad acha nirnay diya he
 Moily's comments on this statement of the Air Force chief have led to controversy
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne apane aadesh main nyaayalay kii nigaraanee main rafel saude kii jaanch sambandhi sabhi yachikaaon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Addressing the media in Jodhpur on Wednesday, the Air Force Chief described the Rafale fighter aircraft as a game changer
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki wo adaalat ke nirnay par koi tippanee nahin karenge lekin supreme court ne bahut acha nirnay diya he
 Because we needed this aircraft very much
 vahiin guuruuvaar ko purv kendriya mantri virappa moili ne kaha ki sarkari record ke mukabik raksha mantralay or vayusena pramukh chaahate the ki is saude main hindustan aironotical limited (HAL) ko shaamil kiya jaae
 He said that the then Air Force Chief had gone to Hindustan Aeronautical Limited with representatives of Dassault and found that HAL was capable and expert in making aircraft
 meraa maananaa he ki vayusena pramukh thik nahin he, ve jhooth bol rahe hai, ve sachai ko dabaa rahe hai
 Following this statement by Veerappa Moily, BJP leaders targeted him

 The decision to discontinue Tipu Jayanthi by @ bjp4karnatakais wrong & a big mistake
 Tipu was not recognised just because he is from minority community but because of his contribution as a ruler
 He fought bravely against British & initiated many development works
 @inckarnataka— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah)july 30, 2019twit ke jariye siddharmaiya ne kaha ki tipu ko sirf isliye nahin pahachaanaa gaya kyonki vah alpsankhyak samudaay se the balki shaasha ke rup main bhi unka yogadan rahaa he

 Many questions are being raised against Chief Minister Raghubar Das (especially for giving ticket to Bhanu Pratap Sahi), accused of corruption and evicting Saryu Rai, who exposed scams
 lekin ab NDTV india se baat chit main raghubar das ne kaha he ki sawaal karne vaale ye bataaen ki congress party ke do sheersh netaa sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kya hai?raghubar das ne kaha ki agar saahi jaise logon par trial chal rahaa hai or ve doshi paae jate hai to unki sadsyta chali jaaegi
 But when he was asked how many scam people had been punished by the government of double engines in the last five years, he did not say anything clearly on it
 haalanki unka daawa he ki unke shashan kaal main jitne adhikariyon par bhrashtachar ke maamle main karrwai hui vaisaa pehle nahin hua tha
 BJP candidate Bhanu Pratap Sahi is accused of the medicine scam
 unke kilaaf CBI or idi chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Trial is currently underway

 Despite this, the BJP not only merged his party but also gave the ticket

 Party leaders say that Sahi was given the ticket on the basis that he was more likely to win in every survey in his area

 But the BJP, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah formed the government in Jharkhand five years ago on the promise of eradication of corruption

 isamen koi andeh nahin ki bhrashtachar or mahangaai ko lekar avadharanaon ne chunaav nateezon ko prabhavit kiya
 Hence the question arises, to what extent do development and governance systems affect electoral fortunes? Statistics are incomplete in this regard
 haalanki acchhee shashan pranali kaa phayda milane or kharaab shashan pranali ko dandit kiye jane ke kuch pramaan hai, lekin isaki spasht vyakhya kerani hogi ki shashan pranali kaa aakhir matlab kya he
 It is related to what the citizens expect from a state government
 ummiden darasal vah pitara hai, jinamein koi naagarik samajhta he ki use ek anukool maahaul mili, kanoon or vyavastha kii acchhee sthiti ho, thos buniyadi suvidhaayen (bijli, sadak or pani) uplabdh hon, saamaajik dhaancha durust bane or bhrashtachar main kami ho
 But some of these things are outside the purview of the state governments, causing the calculations to be reversed
 assam, pashchim bengal, kavral, tamilnadu or pudducheri main haal hi main vidhansabha chunaav ho chuke hai
 Statistics are available on the functioning of the parties in every assembly constituency of these five states
 vidhansabha kshetron ke str par kuch bhinnataaon ke saath saamaajik-aarthik suchakon ke bare main kuch vishesh aankade taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 In this way we are aware of the improvement (or their deterioration) in the socio-economic indicators between 2006 and 2011 and we also know how much difference the votes received by the parties between 2006 and 2011
 kya inke bich koi aapasi sambandh he? yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki yah sawaal nirvachan kshetra ke str par poocha ja rahaa he, kul milakar rajya ke str par nahin
 The results show that if one looks at the constituency level and below, in this way, the indicators that matter most are the deepest and direct links to the family's economic achievements — per capita income and road connectivity
 saamaajik-aarthik kasautiyaan, jaise ki shishu mrityu dar, tikaakaran or shiksha sambandhi parivarti kaarak koi khaas myne nahin rakhte
 Probably not because they are not important, but because the voter knows that they are decided under the central government schemes
 yahaan tak ki kul milakar dekhen to aparaadh bhi isamen myne nahin rakhata, lekin hinsak aparaadhon, aarthik aparaadhon or saamaajik ashaanti se sambandhi aparaadhon kaa chunaavon par asar padataa he
 Does this mean that other socio-economic indicators have no impact on the election results? nothing special
 assam, pashchim bengal, kavral, tamilnadu or pudducheri ke namoona surveykshanon main yahi baat dekhne ko mili
 The improvement in other socio-economic indicators in these five states did not have a significant statistical effect on the voting method

 input: IANS The Union Environment Ministry on Friday issued a show cause notice to the society stating the 31-storey disputed building of the Adarsh cooperative Society in Mumbai as completely illegal and asked to reply in two weeks
 adarsh kooparative houseing sosayadi ko tateey niyaman kshetra (siarjed) adhisuchana 1991 ke tahat niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main notice thamaya gaya he
 Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told reporters, "it has been proved that CRZ rules have been severely violated in the construction of the 31-storey building of Adarsh cooperative Housing Society and the entire building is illegal
" isliye sosayadi ko kaaran bataao notice jari kar poocha gaya he ki is anaadhikrut dhaanche ko kyon na gira diya jaae
 Ramesh said that the Ministry has issued a show cause notice under Section 5 of the Environment (protection) Act, 1986 and has given them two weeks to give a written reply
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava sosayadi ke prabandhan ko hamaare adhikariyon se mulaakaat ke liye ek saptaah kaa samay diya jayega
 According to the minister, the ministry will then decide on further action
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘yah spasht he ki adarsh (sosayadi) ne imaarat banane ke liye maharashtra sarkaar se yaa centre sarkaar se koi anumati nahin lee he
 Therefore the entire building is illegal
 ’ unhone sanket diya ki yah jameen rajya sarkaar kii he yaa raksha vibhaag kii he, isse unke mantralay ko koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Ramesh said, 'it does not matter to us whose land belongs to whom
 hamaara (paryaavaran mantralay kaa) taalluk yahaan tak simit he ki isamen siarjed ke tahat niyamon kaa ulanghan hua he yaa nahin
 He said that in an elaborate meeting of Maharashtra government officials and Union Environment Ministry officials in Delhi on Thursday, it came to the conclusion that the entire structure is illegal and there is a serious violation of CRZ rules
 ramesh ne bataaya ki iske sambandh main maharashtra sarkaar ne november 2009 main bhi sosayadi ko kaaran bataao notice thamaya tha
 However, the environment ministry officials did not give a clear answer regarding the response to this notice and action taken by the government on it
 kya imaarat ko puri tarah giraaye jane kii koi sambhaavna he, is bare main samvaadadaataaon ke sawaal par paryaavaran mantri ne koi spasht pratikriya nahin di, haalanki unhone kaha, ‘notice kaa jawaab milane dijie
 The first step has been taken
 hamaare saamne niyaman ko chhodkar sabhi vikalp khule hai
 In response to a question, the officials of the Ministry said that in the area in which the 31-storey building of the Adarsh society has been built, a maximum of nine floors can be allowed in the building
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘main spasht kar duun ki yadi us kshetra main nirmaan kii anumati milti to adhiktam nau manjilon kii manjuuri di jaati
 When reporters asked if the government could consider any regulation of the remaining nine by demolishing the 22 floors of the building, he said that nothing could be said about it
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha, ‘main siddhantat: kisi nirmaan kaary ke niyaman ke paksh main nahin hum
 This leads to the wrong message

 In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party seems to be ahead of the BJP and Congress in the preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sarkari kaarykram ke bahaane aam aadmi party dilli kii tamaam vidhansabhaon main apane ummidavaaron ke liye vot maang rahi he
 In this connection, AAP leaders in the Seelampur Assembly on Saturday demanded a strong vote for north-east Lok Sabha in-charge Dilip Pandey
 silampur vidhansabha main ek naale ke nirmaan ke udghaatan ko lekar manch taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 PWD Minister Satyendar Jain was accompanied by Environment Minister Imran Hussain and mlas of the area on this platform
 satyendra jain ne elaan kiya ki aam aadmi party, north east se loksabhaa prabharee dilip pandeya ko chunaav ladaane ja rahi he
 Meanwhile, appealing to the people to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party, Satyendar Jain said, 'vote for Pappu, vote for Kejriwal
 'bataa den ki virdohi dalon ke netaa congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye pappu shabd kaa istemaal karte rahete hai
 Even in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi himself made the statement that the leader of the opposition parties used this word for him, which does not matter to him
 Satyendar Jain said, "by campaigning in BJP parks, vote for Congress Have been

 Kejriwal has the power to show Modi the stars during the day, the power of mung bean in Modi's chest
 "north east loksabhaa se aam aadmi party ke prabharee dilip pandeya ne khud ke liye vot maange
 Counting the math of the vote bank, he said that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 46 percent, Aam Aadmi Party got 33 percent and Congress got 15 percent
 dilip pandeya ne aage kaha ki maan lijiye pehali sthiti main bijepi kaa 10% vot congress ko mil jaae to bijepi 46 se hatakar 36% par aa jaaegi or aam aadmi party 33% hi rahegi lekin badhat bijepi kii bani rahegi
 But in the second case, if the Aam Aadmi Party gets 10% of the bjp's 46% vote, then the Aam Aadmi Party will reach 43%
 isliye congress ko vot dekar apana vot barbaad na karen
 Let us tell you that the number of Dalit and Muslim community in Seelampur Assembly is very high, which is the eye of all the parties

 China agreed to the issue of Masood Azhar, the mastermind of the dreaded terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, but its involvement continues with India's inclusion in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)
 shuukravaar ko china ne kaha ki jab tak parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) main hastakshar nahin karne vaale deshon ko lekar kisi yojana par koi sahmati nahin ban jaati he, tab tak bharat ko enesji main shaamil karne kii koi charchaa nahin hogi
 When Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang was asked when the agreement would be reached, he refused to give a time limit
 unhone kaha ki is masale par vistaar se charchaa karne kii jarurat he
 So they cannot make any prediction about this
 jab china ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa kong se poocha gaya ki kya bharat ke enesji main shaamil kiye jane ko lekar china ke rukh main badlaav aayaa he
 In response, he said that there was no discussion about India in the NSG meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan
 jab tak parmaanu aprasar sandhi main hastakshar nahin karne vaale deshon ko lekar kisi yojana par sahmati nahin ban jaati he, tab tak enesji main duusare deshon ko shaamil karne ko lekar charchaa nahin hogi
 During this time, China's foreign ministry spokesman Kang said that China is not putting constraints on India's entry into the NSG
 china to sirf enesji ke niyamon or prakriyaaon ke paalan kii baat kah rahaa he
 He said, 'china is not putting constraints on the inclusion of any country in the NSG but not only India
 enesji kii prakriya or niyam hai, jinke mutabik sadsy desh faisla lete hai
 i think that the NSG meeting is going on in Astana and the countries with non-nuclear non-proliferation treaty, political and legal issues will be discussed
 'jab chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa se kaha gaya ki enesji ke zyaadaatar sadsy bharat ko shaamil karne kaa samarthan kar rahe hai, jabaki china lagaataar adnga laga rahaa he, to is par unhone kaha, 'yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki china enesji main bharat ke pravesh main adnga laga rahaa he
 However i would definitely say that the NSG is a multilateral non-nuclear nonproliferation mechanism that has its own rules and procedures
 sabhi sadsy deshon ko enesji ke niyamon or prakriyaaon kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Also, any decision should be taken by consensus
 'aapako bataa den ki china samet 48 desh enesji ke sadsy hai
 This group ensures the exchange of nuclear materials and technology for civilian operations on a global scale
 enesji kaa gathan bharat dwaara saal 1974 main parmaanu pareekshan kiye jane ke virodh main hua tha
 India applied for membership of NSG in May 2016, which China has been opposing since the beginning
 bharat ke saath hi pakistan ne bhi enesji kii sadsyta ke liye aavedan kiya he
 China says the NSG will include only those countries that have signed the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
 bharat ne ab parmaanu aprasar sandhi main hastakshar nahin kiya he
 Earlier, China continued to be a hindrance to India's attempt to declare Masood Azhar, the leader of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, as a global terrorist, but in the end, he had to withdraw his obstruction recently
 iske baad sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kar diya tha
 This was seen as a major success of India, while Pakistan was considered a failure

 Elections were postponed during the Emergency

 India's economy has the potential to grow rapidly, but the Modi government's mismanagement has pushed the country's economy into recession

 unhone kaha ki automobile sector main 3

 He said that the situation in rural India is even more pathetic

 As the time for the Lok Sabha elections is getting closer, the restlessness of all the political parties to fix the nail and nail in their respective areas is increasing
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii beti or congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii bahan priyanka wadra ne maa or bhai kii sansadeey seat kii kaman apane haathon main lene ke sanket de die hai, taaki ve donon aam chunaav ke dauraan swatantra hokar desh ke anya hisson kaa daura kar saken
 Priyanka Vadra has increased her activism in both these areas to fix the organizational structure in Sonia's parliamentary seat Rae Bareli and Rahul's Lok Sabha seat in Amethi
 rahul or priyanka ke pichley amethi daure ke samay yah dekhne main bhi aayaa
 Priyanka has been doing homework so far on her mother Sonia's seat, but now both parliamentary seats will be directly in her hands
 party ke ranneetikaron ko bhi lagata he ki haal hi main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaav main jis tarah se party ko raibareli or amethi main munh kii khaani padi, uske baad priyanka ne in donon siton kii kaman apane haathon main lene kaa man bana liya he
 Ramesh Gautam, a local senior journalist associated with Rae Bareli and Amethi, said that there has been a big difference between the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the situation now
 tab raibareli or amethi kii 10 vidhansabha siton main se 6 congress ke kabje main thi, lekin is baar yah sankhya ghatakar do tak pahunch gai he
 For the Gandhi family, it is like a bell of danger
 unhone kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav main donon siton par party ke bheetar hue jabardast andruni kalah kii vajah se hi party ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Annoyed with this, Priyanka has made up her mind to take command of both the seats
 duusari dilachasp baat yah he ki congress ke uttar pradesh maamalon ke prabharee madhusudan mistre or pradesh adhyaksh nirmal khatri pehle hi yah ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki congress itawa or mainpuri main bhi apane pratyaashee utaaregi, jabaki sapa pramukh ne raibareli or amethi main sapa ke ummidavaari ko lekar apane pattey nahin khole hai
 In this context, if the SP fielded its candidates in both these seats, the contest in both the seats would be very interesting
 raibareli or amethi main priyanka kii bhoomika ke bare main puche jane par congress ke pradesh pravaktaa jishaan haidar ne bataaya, ‘raibareli or amethi gandhi parivaar kii paramparaagat seat rahi he or yah faisla bhi usee parivaar ko karnaa he ki vahaan kiski kitni bhoomika rahegi
 Haider said that it is enough that Priyanka Gandhi has been giving more time to Rae Bareli so far, but this time the focus will be on both the seats and under his guidance the election was contested earlier and will still be contested

 com Steve Jobs is said to have experimented with the combination of creativity with technology in an epoch-making impact at least six sectors of the industry in the 21st century — personal computers, animation films, music, Phone, computer tablets and digital publishing
 10 aktubar, 1999 ko time patrika main prakashit lekh main unhone kaha tha ki unhen kala or vigyaan ke sandhi sthal par khadi chijen prabhavit karti hai
 Reading Steve's book: My life, my tongue, edited by George Behm, one realizes over and over again that he was a technologist who worked with an artist's creativity with digital products from the Apple company
 Who made technology a part of human life
 ipod, ipad, iphone kuch aise prabhaavshaalee utpaada rahe, jinhone takanic or manushya ke sambandhon ko ugantkaari dhang se prabhavit kiya
 While they were neither computer hardware engineers, nor software programmers
 lekin computer or uski takanic ko lekar unhone jo prayog kiye, usne computer ko 'nijee’ se niztam bana diya
 The personality of Steve Jobs and his imaginative products have in a way defined the tech era
 steve jobs khud ko 'takneekee netaa’ ke rup main dekhte the, jo behtareen logon ko apane saath jodakar apane takneekee sapanom ko is tarah se saakaar karte ki 'appal’ ke utpaada aam logon ke liye sapana ban jate
 a standard of excellence that allows people to compare and view other products such as phones or ipads
 is bhaagambhag ke daur main, jisamen logon ke paas ghar main rahane kaa samay nahin hota, appal ne aise utpaada bazaar main utaare, jisamen log daudte-bhaagate sangeet-cinema kaa apana shauk puraa kar sakate the, sabase jude rah sakate the or apane saath apane shauk ko lekar chal sakate the
 Steve Jobs was the brain behind great products like ipod, ipad, who considered the Beatles' famous group of singers as their role models
 unka maananaa tha ki 've chaar ati pratibhavan vyakti’ the jinhone ek-duusare ke nakaaratmak pakshon ko niyantran main rakhaa
 They balanced each other and overall they were great at combining fractions
 ve kehete hai, ''main bijness ko bhi aise hi dekhtaa hum
 Great things in business are never done by one person, they are done by a group of people
 ” prasangvash, unhone 9 november, 1998 ko fortune patrika ke ank main kaha tha ki prasiddh gayak bob dilan unke jivan ke aadarshon main rahe hai, kyonki ve bhi picasso kii tarah vifaltaa kaa jokhim uthaate rahe hai
 Steve constantly took this risk of failure with his new experiments and was always trying to get ahead of his time
 unka maananaa tha, ''kabristaan main sabase dhani vyakti hone se mujhe koi antar nahin padataa
 
 
 Going to bed at night and saying that we have done something amazing - this is important to me
 ”jobs kii aadhyatm main gahari ruchi thi
 In 1974-75 he also came to India to get knowledge at Neem Karauli Baba's ashram near Nainital

 The Shiv Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana', made sharp attacks on Aam Aadmi Party and Congress on Tuesday
 lekh main pathakon ko AAP kaa shraadh karne or congress kaa pindadaan karne kii salaah dete hue donon hi partiyon kii khilli udayi gai he
 The editorial said that the Aam Aadmi Party is divided into two factions and is suffering the brunt of separation from Anna
 'saamana' ne hameshaa kii tarah bhashaai shaleenta kaa khyaal nahin rakhaa he
 Targeting the AAP in the letter, it is written that Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party is such a donkey that is stinking and everyone wants to stay away from him because of his bad smell
 aisa kyon he, sach sabake saamne aana chahie
 The editorial further states, 'two factions have now formed in the party
 ek gut kumaar vishwaas kaa he, jo kejariwal ko party kaa sanyojak nahin maanati or doosraa gut kejariwal kaa he jo kuch nahin kar saktaa
 'ashwini followed the religion, in favor of the leader who was ousted from the Aam Aadmi Party, it is written that he followed his religion, but the party showed him the way out
 saamana main kaha gaya he, 'aam aadmi party ab aisi haalat main he ki yaa to uske loksabhaa ummidavaar bhaag rahe hai yaa phir tikat bechney ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Alam is that the party is also divided into two groups in which no one wants to see Kejriwal, but Kejriwal has thrown out the party's founder Ashwini Upadhyaya
 ashvini ne keval dharm, aatank or algaavvaadi baaten karne vaale logon ko baahar karne kii maang kya rakhi wo khud baahar ho gaye
 'kejriwal considers himself a emperor, while targeting Kejriwal, the editorial said,' He is the person who did not listen to his mentor, what would the public hear
 anna hajaare ne ise prishthbhumi di, lekin isane anna ke vichaarsheel eent kii base ko hi hataa liya or khud ko shahenshaah samajhakar jehar ugalane laga

 lekin kejariwal ne yah kahkar baat ghuma di thi ki wo keechad saaf karne ke liye keechad main utar rahaa he
 But after the fall of the government in Delhi and the opening of the pole-band, all the pretense of getting into the mud and cleaning it has come in front of everyone and the electoral bone thrown by Kejriwal is now stuck in his neck

 But these two are still cheating the people in the name of revolution and spewing venom
 alam yah he ki jab janata kii seva kaa mauka mila to janalokapal kaa damru bajaate rahe or bhaag gaye, lekin ye nahin dekha ki janata kitni takalif main he

 sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he ki jab sonia ko muslim vot bank kii yaad ai to vah bukhari ke paas jholii failaakar khadi ho gai, lekin kejariwal is par maun rahe
 It became clear that Kejriwal's idea of jan Lokpal was also loose
 or ant main
 
 
 It is written at the end of the editorial, 'just spewing poison on others does not prove anything

 Because of this, angry Shilpi decided to fill the nomination from his own seat to challenge Rawat
 tippaniyan Shilpi was also tried by the big Congress leaders of Delhi, but she did not listen
 unhone gadarpur se bhi apana namakan bhar diya he
 The victory or defeat of any candidate is in its place, but in the Uttarakhand, where the Congress faces the challenge of saving its power and is directly confronted with the BJP, the rebellion of the people only creates difficulty

 If the quality of laddus is good, then i have no problem in eating from Rajnath Singh's hand! Neither in greeting the Prime Minister nor in saluting Dua to Sitaram Yechury, nor in saying hello to Sonia Gandhi
 sab ek duusare ke virdohi hai lekin yah kahaan tay hua he ki ye log ek duusare se nahin milenge
 Will not even see each other hello
 pradhanmantri modi to congressi netaaon or unke bacchon kii shaadi main bhi jate hai
 Manmohan Singh used to go to Shahnawaz Hussain's Iftar party
 kya ab in tasveeron kaa istemaal chunavi raajnneeti main bhi hoga? aisa hota rahaa to ek din netaa saath uthanaa baithna band kar denge
 When everyone is the same then why should there be any problem in meeting each other
 trinmul congress ke saansad derek o bryan ne press conference main ek tasviir jari kii jisamen rajnath singh sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ko laddu khilaa rahe hai
 Looks like Mr
 Sahab got nervous after seeing himself eating laddus in the BJP office! After the release of this picture, Karat's statement came that i have never met Rajnath Singh
 thik he tasviir farzi he lekin kya yah bhi hairaani kii baat nahin ki itane saal se raajnneeti main rahane ke baad prakaash karaat or rajnath singh kii bhi kabhi mulaaqaat hi nahin hui
 Now this photo has turned out to be fake
 bijepi ne jaldi hi is tasviir kaa bhanda phod diya
 Nowadays, a lot of photographs are being taken by putting Suresh's head in Ramesh's torso
 is photoshop raajnneeti ne yah haal kar diya he ki ek din log apana hi photo dekhakar bolenge ki yah meraa hi he yaa photoshop ! soshal media par rose yah khel ho rahaa he
 If i tell who started the game of Photoshop, people will remove my own photoshop that i am traveling with the Prime Minister and now it is my turn for the Rajya Sabha
 haal hi main raashtrapati ne chah logon ko manonit kiya he
 The name for the seventh seat is yet to come for which the names of many journalists or journalist co-owners or owners of journalists are discussed
 jise bhi meraa photoshaap karnaa he jaldi karo bhai ! Recently, when the Prime Minister went on an aerial tour of the Chennai flood, a photoshopped picture was released from the Central Information Bureau
 kaaphi hangaamaa hua ki sarkaar bhi yah sab karne lagi he
 When such pictures are being released from the government office, why be surprised at the press conference
 karne se zyaada karte hue dikhnaa hamaari raajnneeti kaa nayaa jugad he
 In this country, many fake companies have been looting for years saying that you deposit money with us will be ten times in two months
 log khushi khushi lut jate hai, aaj tak lutate rahe hai
 Leaders are beginning to understand that there is no need to panic if caught twice, the public will be robbed next time too
 bijepi samarthakon ne loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke yuva kaal kii ek tasviir khub chalaai jisamen vah jhaadu lagaate dikh rahe hai
 i do not remember whether the BJP or Modiji himself denied this picture at that time
 baad main soshal media par is tasviir ko chunauti di gai ki kisi duusare kii tasviir main modiji kii tasviir laga di gai
 Ram knows what is true vaise photoshop kii jis tasviir se phayda hota ho uske khandan kaa rivaaj kam he
 Anyway, the task of challenging is with the opposing party
 patrkaar bhi ab is khel main funsane lage hai
 Some give some impression and tweet
 haal hi main ek patrkaar ne pradhanmantri kii photoshop tasviir twitor par saajha kar di
 He had to apologize and according to the news the BJP has also registered an FIR
 haal hi main ek channel main bahes ke dauraan bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne apane tablet se ek tasviir dikhaai
 On the pretext of that picture, Patra was claiming that six Indian soldiers were holding the tricolor in their hands till death
 baad main scrol dot in par shuddhbrat sengupta ne ek lambey lekh main bataaya ki yah tasviir vishwa yuddh kii he or ye bhartiya nahin america sainik hai
 He has a US flag in his hand which has been removed from Photoshop to fit the tricolor
 mujhe bilkul nahin pataa ki baad main sambit yaa ukt channel ne is par khandan prakashit kiya yaa nahin
 The comments photoshop koun karata he iskaa pataa nahin chalata lekin saajha karne waalon se chalata he
 They are spreading due to the support of party supporters
 yah itnaa bad gaya he ki ab netaa pravaktaa or patrkaar bhi photoshop tasveeron ko lekar utsahit ho jate hai
 Knowingly and unknowingly as well
 kuch log photoshop kaa sach pakadaney main lage rahete hai
 It will be difficult for you public to remain in public for a few days
 raajnneeti ko tasveeron kaa khel banane main janata bhi shaamil he kyonki ve ab tasveeron ke aage apni buddhi kaa samarpan kar rahi he
 So lie has become a big truth in Indian politics
 dinon din yah satya bada hota ja rahaa he
 Be happy that now true pictures of that lie have started coming
 aap phir lutane vaale hai
 Those who have done ten to twenty have got new technology
 aapako mubarak ! Will these pictures now be used in electoral politics as well? If this happens, then one day the leaders will stop getting up together
 jab sab ek jaise hi hai to ek duusare se milane main dikkat kyon honi chahie
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien released a picture in the press conference in which Rajnath Singh is feeding laddus to CPM leader Prakash Karat
 lagata he khud ko bijepi ke daftar main laddu khate dekh karaat sahab ghabara gaye! is tasviir ke jari hote hi karaat kaa bayaan aa gaya ki maine to kabhi rajnath singh se mulaaqaat hi nahin kii he
 OK, the picture is fake but is it not surprising that Prakash Karat and Rajnath Singh have never met after being in politics for so many years? ab yah tasviir nakli nikal gai he
 BJP soon busted this picture
 aajkal ramesh ke dhad main suresh kaa sir lagaakar kaaphi photo nikaali ja rahi he
 This Photoshop politics has made it clear that one day people will see their own photo and say whether it is mine or Photoshop! This game is happening daily on social media
 photoshop kaa khel kisne shuru kiya yah bataaoonga to log meraa hi photoshop nikaal denge ki main pradhanmantri ke saath vimaan yatra kar rahaa hum or ab rajya sabha kii baari meri he
 Recently, the President has nominated six people
 saatvin seat ke liye naam aana baaki he jiske liye kai patrakaron yaa patrkaar sah maalikon yaa patrakaron ke maalikon ke naam kii charchaa he
 Whoever wants to do my photoshop hurry brother! haal hi main jab pradhanmantri chennai kii baadh kaa hawaii daura karne gaye tab kendriya patr soochna karyaalay kii taraf se photoshop tasviir jari ho gai
 There was a lot of uproar that the government has started doing all this
 jab sarkaar ke daftar se aisi tasviren jari ho rahi hai to press conference me jari hone par hairaani kyon
 Being seen doing more than doing is the new jugaad of our politics
 is desh main kai farzi companiyaan saalon se yah bataa kar lut rahi hai ki aap hamaare yahaan paisa jamaa kijiye do maheene main das guna ho jayega
 People are happily plundered, they have been plundered till date
 netaa samajhane lage hai ki ek do baar pakade jane se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he, janata agali baar bhi luutegi
 During the Lok Sabha elections, BJP supporters gave a picture of the prime minister's youth, in which he is seen sweeping
 mujhe samaran nahin ki us daur main bijepi yaa swany modiji ne is tasviir kaa khandan kiya tha yaa nahin
 Later on social media, this picture was challenged that the picture of Modiji was put in someone else's picture
 ram jane kya sach he
 By the way, the photo of Photoshop that benefits, the custom of denying it is less
 vaise bhi chunauti dene kaa kaam virdohi dal kaa he
 Journalists are also getting entangled in this game
 kuch kaa kuch chhap dete hai or twit kar dete hai
 Recently a journalist shared a photoshopped photo of the Prime Minister on Twitter
 use maafee maangani padi or khabaron ke mutabiq bijepi ne epa ai aar bhi darj kar di he
 Recently, during a debate in a channel, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra showed a picture from his tablet
 us tasviir ke bahaane sambit paatra daawa kar rahe the ki chah bhartiya jawan marate dam tak haathon main tirangaa thame hue hai
 Later on scroll
in, Shubhbrata Sengupta told in a long article that this picture is of World War and they are American soldiers, not Indians
 unke haath main america kaa jhanda he jise photoshop se hataa kar tirangaa fit kar diya gaya he
 i do not know at all whether Sambit or the said channel published a rebuttal on it
 tippaniyan Who does photoshop is not known but is shared by those who share it
 party samarthak ke hawaale se inkaa prasar ho rahaa he
 It has grown so much that now even leaders, spokespersons and journalists get excited about Photoshop photos
 jaanboojh kar bhi or anjaane main bhi
 Some people are trying to capture the truth of Photoshop
 aap janata ke liye kuch din main janata bana rahanaa mushkil ho jayega
 The public is also involved in making politics a game of photographs because they are now surrendering their intelligence to photographs
 lihaaza bhartiya raajnneeti main jhooth ek bada satya ho gaya he
 This truth is getting bigger day by day
 kush rahiye ki ab us jhooth kaa sachhee tasviren bhi aane lagi hai
 You are going to plunder again

 swine flu kaa kahar duniya ke kai deshon main fail chukaa he or isse pehle ki ye beemaari bharat pahunche, ehtiyaat baratna bahut jaruri he
 Government of India is going to issue advisory for those going to the countries affected by this disease and has also issued a toll free number
 mexico kii sadakon par adhiktar log sargical mask pahane najar aa rahe hai
 This is the fear of swine flu which has so far taken 1614 people, 103 of whom have died
 is flu ne america ke raashtrapati bhawan main bhi khalabali machaa di he
 US President Barack Obama said that we are very serious about swine flu and all necessary steps are being taken to prevent it
 lekin isse pehle ki ye khatarnaak jaanaleva beemaari bharat tak pahunche, sarkaar ne prabhavit deshon newjiland
 Spain, France, have decided to issue advisory to those going to the US and issued a 1075 toll free number to inform the public
 iske alaava swasthya vibhaag ne swine flu prabhavit deshon se 10 din main lautne waalon kii jaanch karne ko kaha he
 The first death from spinal flu occurred in Southern Oaxaca State
 lekin jab tak marij kaa sample bheja jaataa
 By then, the merger engulfed many hospital staff
 khaas baat ye he ki aamtaur par flu ke shikaar bachche or buudhe hote hai
 But the victims of swine flu are people between the ages of 20 and 40 years
 dilli se ke saath ajtak beuro To improve its economic condition, Indian Railways is going to give its passengers the option of waiving subsidy on the lines of LPG
 rail mantralay ne iske liye tikat booking form main alag se kollam banaae jane kii manjuuri de di he
 In this column it will be asked whether you want to get subsidy on railway tickets or not
 jo log is par sabsidi lene par tik lagaayenge unako sabsidised rate par rail tikat milegaa or jo log sabsidi nahin lenaa chahenge unako phul rate par tikat milegaa
 This method will also be arranged on IRCTC website for online booking of train tickets
 rail mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik sabsidi lene yaa naa lene ke vikalp kii vyavastha agle maheene se shuru kar di jaaegi
 43 percent subsidy is received, in fact, the Railways incur a loss in passenger fares and on this 43 percent subsidy is given
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab yah hua railway ko kisi bhi tikat par sau rupee ke kharch par sirf 57 rupee kii kamai hoti he
 Because of this, there is constant economic pressure on the railways
 isse chhutkaaraa paane ke liye railway lagaataar koshish kar rahaa he, lekin in sabake bich haal hi main ek vakya aisa hua ki railway ko ek nayaa idia mil gaya
 Such was the idea that Avatar Krishna Kher of Avatar of Faridabad got his ticket booked through the website of IRCTC, when he took the print of the train ticket, it was written below that you know that 43 per cent of your fare is borne by the common citizens of the country
 We do
 iske baad avatar krishna ne apni rail tikat main mili sabsidi ke badale main 950 rupee kaa check banavaa kar railway ko bhej diya
 After this incident, Railway Board officials came up with the idea that why not give the option of giving subsidy to the common people during ticket booking
 bina sabsidi yatra karnaa chahenge logrelvay board ke ek ucch adhikari ke mutabik philhal to avatar krishna ke check ko railway abhi bhunaa nahin rahaa he kyonki abhi is tarah kaa koi system hi nahin he
 But from next month, the ministry is also going to give the option of not taking subsidy on railway tickets
 railway ko ummid he ki desh main aise tamaam log honge jo apni rail yatra kaa puraa kiraaya dene main sakasham hai or vah rail kiraye kii sabsidi nahin lenaa chahenge
 Railway is trying to give such an option to such people, where on one hand the able people will be able to travel without any subsidy, while those who want to travel at a subsidized rate will not have trouble
 yatri kiraye main ho rahaa he ghatrailvay bordki haal hi main is bare main ek baithak hui jisamen yah tay kiya gaya is sabsidi ko chhodane kaa vikalp rail rigerveshan form main diya jaae
 The special thing is that this option will be given not only to senior citizens or to fellow commuters who are getting discounts in any other category
 rail adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki pichley kai varshon main kharch ke mukaable kiraye main badhotaree naa kiye jane kii vajah se yatri kiraye main lagaataar ghaataa ho rahaa he
 Third AC gets the right fare The situation at this time is that it charges only 57% fare from the passenger as compared to the expenses incurred in railway kayatrikiraya
 is tarah se 43 fisadi sabsidi he
 In such a situation, the railway authorities claim that the Railways are continuously going into losses due to non-increase in fares
 har category kii yatra main agar dekhen to sirf or sirf third asi ke yatriyon se hi utana kiraaya miltaa he jo unke kharch ke mukaable thodaa sa zyada he
 Passenger fare in all other categories is being charged less than the expenditure
 agast main lagu ho sakati he vyavastharailvay ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he is sabsidi chhodane ke vikalp ke liye puraa system taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he or aisi sambhaavna he kii agast ke maheene tak yah vyavastha lagu kar di jaaegi
 After this it will be seen how many passengers would like to travel at full fare
 selary to badi he magar samasya usase bhi badi hai, ham saatven vetan ayog ke lagu hone kii bhi baat karenge magar pehle jo kar rahe the, karte rahenge
 The condition of higher education is not bad, it is bad for those who went to college for higher education, paid admission fees, spent 3-4 years there, yet it did not matter that no professor came to teach in the class room
 ve degree kaa intazaar karte rahe, professor kaa kiya hi nahin
 Many of the remaining professors teach very well, carry the bag of many political parties and many do not know how to teach
 jis mulk main kisi ko bhi vaais chancelar bana diya jaataa ho, vahaan sirf yogyata ke aadhaar par prophessoron kii niyukti kaa bharosa itani aasaani se paidaa nahin ho saktaa he
 Some universities are teaching professors, new ways of burdening them are being adopted so that there is no need to hire new professors and where it is difficult to avoid need, decisions are being made to keep adhoc
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne report bheji he ki uttarakhand mantrimandal ne permanent profasaron kii bahaali kii jagah theke par lekturer rakhe jane kaa faisla kiya he
 15 days ago, it was written to the Public Service Commission that the process of filling 797 posts should start but on October 11, the decision was reversed and now 585 lecturers will be hired
 chaar saal se tin shed main chal rahaa yah college uttarakhand ke champavat zile ke banabasaa shahar kaa he
 The college is running under a tin shed in the campus of the staff quarters of the hospital
 college ke paas na to apni imaarat he na apana shauchalay
 Students use the hospital toilet
 is tin shed main chah vishyon kii padhai ke liye paanch teacher hai
 It is the only college in the area
 padhai kaise hoti hogi isaki phikr na to padhane waalon ko hogi or na padhaane waalon ko
 No one is asking, everyone is spending their time
 is college main sava sau chaatr apana jivan barbaad kar rahe hai, unka jivan kahin or barbaad na ho or uski zimmedaari kisi or na par aa jaae, isliye sarkaar tin shed main yah college chalaa rahi he
 Students who do not want to be wasted here have gone to colleges in other cities from here, where you can estimate the condition of colleges
 isliye rajya sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki jo 585 lekturer theke par rakhe jaaenge unhen 500 rupaya prati ghanta par padhaanaa hoga
 No matter how many hours they read, they will not get more than 25000 in a month
 ise adhiktam nunatam kehete hai yani jo minimum he vahi adhiktam
 Raj Mistry also has a daily wage of 500 in the state and Shiksha Mistry of Government College also has a salary of 500 rupees
 ye udaaravaadi system kaa samaajwaad he
 You may also be wondering how we reached Banbasa adjacent to Tanakpur, in fact a reader on Facebook reached us
 kai baar lagata he ki samaaj ne hi ucch shiksha ko chhod diya he
 When crores of students from all over India have been passing without lecturer-professors, then why not stop the college system and all the students of the city on the 5th of every month, in a big ground in the city The pass should be declared in isse to na to professor rakhane kaa jhanjhat hoga na hi vaais chancelar or shiksha mantri
 We are witnessing the condition of a society which is not being seen during this series
 magar sochie is haalat ko hamaara samaaj kitne aaraam se dekhtaa aa rahaa he
 Just as he believes that the soul may not be immortal, this condition of colleges is definitely immortal
 lekin falodi ke jainarayan mohan laal purohit rajkeey snatakottar mahavidhyalay kii imaarat banane vaale ne aisa nahin sochaa
 The building of this college is magnificent, but even in the magnificent building, our systems leave their mark
 mumbai jaakar kamyaabi hasil karne vaale hemchand purohit ko laga ki unke ilaake main college kii acchhee imaarat honi chahie to apni jeb se 5 karod lagaakar imaarat bana di
 With so much armament, he has invested five crores to build a post graduate college with modern facilities but there are no teachers to teach here
 16 lekturer-professor hone chahie magar hai sirf teen
 There should have been 27 employees but there are only 7
 30-30 kilometre se chaatr yahaan eme karne aate hai
 Even after enrollment of nearly 2000 students, there is no teacher here
 1900 chaatro ko ek jagah jamaa kar barbaad karne kaa project sarkarein hi chalaa sakati hai
 In 2011, this college was formed and given to the government
 rajasthan main ek nae system kaa pataa chalaa he
 Only one of the permanent teachers of other districts is sent here for one month and studies here, never happens
 sochie mumbai ke seth hemchand purohit ne kya-kya sapane dekhe honge jab unhone paanch karod lagaakar yah imaarat banavaai hogi
 If they wanted, they could earn profits by building a college on their land, but there are very few who make the government get the building done
 unhone bas itnaa chaha ki unke pita kaa naam rah jaae isliye is college kaa naam he hemchand jai narayan purohit mahavidhyalay, agar sarkaar ne bharosa nahin todaa hota to hemchand jaise kitne hi udyogpati aage aate or college bana kar apane zile yaa gaanv ke naam par de dete, jaisaa ki pehle bhi log karte rahe hai
 Hemchand ji not only donated 100 bighas of land for this college, but also built buildings in ten bighas of land
 rajasthan se chalate hai ab jharkhand
 Lets take the position of Ranchi University
 12 july, 1960 se ranchi universti chal rahi he
 Today there are 64 colleges under it
 23 post graduate vibhaag hai
 There are two lakh students, in the university where such a conscious population of young people is, there should be a golden age in the practice of democracy and systems
 magar ranchi uniwarsity ke chaatr bhi, lagata he ki class main professor kaa nahin, teen saal baad kisi tarah degree kaa intazaar karte rah jate hai
 The vacant posts here should have been restored directly, but not since 1982
 aap 21veen sadi main ja rahe hai, ranchi uniwarsity 20veen sadi main hi fansi padi he
 After getting promotion to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor then retired as a professor and the seats were vacant
 yahaan kantrect par teacher rakhe jate hai
 Research scholars take classes
 prophessoron ko prashasnic kaam karne hote hai kyonki in kaamon ke liye non teaching staff kii bhartee nahin hoti he
 i doubt that many students know that reading to teach their professor is also teaching
 na professor bataate hai or na chaatr poochhate hai
 Everyone feels that professors are computers, turn them on, teach on, so get admission from them, welcome the minister and also make charge of essay writing competition
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai
 300 students have taken admission in history but the teacher is the same
 commers main aath sau chaatr hai, magar padhaane ke liye maatr 3 teacher hai
 The condition is that the teacher should take class or test or check the copy
 teen-teen, chaar-chaar maheenaa pariksha hoti he or phir kapi check hoti hai
 The teacher says that we still teach, but you can understand what education will be
 is college main ranchi ke aas-paas ke gramin ilaake se bachche padhane aate hai
 a student comes here cycling daily from 40 km, but the system fails him daily
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki is dabaav se nipatane ke liye hamane khaas tarah se routine banaaya he taaki kisi vakt ek hazaar se adhik chaatr campus main na ho
 The professor at IIM Ahmadabad should do a study on Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College
 yah college mukhyamantri ke awaas se maatr teen kilometre kii duuri par he magar sarkaar kii nigaah se ek lakh prakaash varsh dur he
 Ramlakhan Singh Yadav was a strong politician of Bihar, there is a college in his name
 hamaare mulk main maatr 200 karod kii murti banane par vivaad ho gaya
 i am sorry for this maang yah honi chahie tha ki ram kii murti ban rahi he to 200 kii jagah 20,000 karod kii laagat se banani chahie
 So that the world knows that we may not be able to build a college for the youth of India, may not save those who have remained, but if we wish, the idol will be built
 hamaare yuva ab class rup main padhakar paas nahin honge, ve tivi channel ke saamne in vishyon par dibet dekhte hue agucated ho rahe hai
 The principal of Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College is right, what can they do when someone is not doing anything, what can they do
 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he
 In many places, Naik's team also does a good job
 par nack or reating se kya hoga, kya aapako pataa chalegaa ki falaan college main 70 fisadi professor nahin hai
 The future of ten thousand to ten thousand students is being wasted by taking admission fees
 magar yah masalaa zaruri nahin he
 The idol should be made
 suna he netaa log zehar pine lage hai
 The nectar that millions of students of India have drank by going to university has immortalized the courage of our systems and the students are shabby
 yah pankti tabhi samaj aegi jab aap ise chaar baar padhenge or paanch baar sunenge
 The comments universti ke shikshakon ke liye ek khushi kii khabar he
 It is not that bad systems do not bring happiness
 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations
 centrel uniwarsity, state universti or aded college ke shikshakon kaa vetan badha he
 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent
 sattarudh dal kaa jhola uthaane waalon kii nahin, padhane waalon ko naukari milegi
 In the country in which anyone is made Vice Chancellor, the confidence of appointing professors on the basis of merit cannot be so easily created
 kuch uniwarsity main professor padhaa rahe hai, unheen par boj daalane ke nae-nae tareeke apanaae ja rahe hai taaki nae professor rakhane kii zarurat na pade or jahaan zarurat se bachanaa mushkil he, vahaan edock rakhane ke faisle ho rahe hai
 Our colleague Dinesh Mansera has sent a report that the Uttarakhand cabinet has decided to hire lecturers on contract instead of reinstatement of permanent professors
 15 din pehle lok seva ayog ko likhaa gaya tha ki 797 pad bharne kii prakriya shuru ho magar 11 oktober ke din faisla palat gaya or ab 585 lekturer theke par rakhe jaaenge
 This college, which has been running in a tin shed for four years, is from Banbasa town in Champawat district of Uttarakhand
 aspataal ke stoff quarter ke campus main tin shed ke neeche chal rahaa he college
 The college neither has its own building nor its own toilet
 chaatr aspataal ke shauchalay kaa hi istamaal karte hai
 This tin shed has five teachers for teaching six subjects
 yah ilaake kaa ekmaatr college he
 How will the studies be done, neither the students nor the students will worry about it
 koi sawaal nahin kar rahaa, sab apana samay kaat rahe hai
 In this college, 125 students are wasting their lives, their lives should not be wasted anywhere else and the responsibility falls on someone else, so the government is running this college in tin shed
 jo chaatr yahaan nahin barbaad hona chaahate wo yahaan se duusare shahar ke collejon main chale gaye hai jahaan ke collejon kii haalat kaa anumaan aap laga sakate hai
 Therefore, the state government has decided that the 585 lecturers who will be hired on contract will have to teach at 500 rupees per hour
 ve chaahe kitna bhi ghanta padhaa len magar maheene main unhen 25000 se adhik nahin milegaa
 This is called maximum minimum i
e
 maximum which is minimum
 rajya main raaj mistre kii bhi dihadi 500 he or rajkeey college ke shiksha mistre kii dihadi bhi 500 rupee hai
 This is the socialism of the liberal system
 aap bhi soch rahe honge ki ham tanakpur se sate banabasaa kaise pahunch gaye, darasal fasebuk par ek pathak ne hamen pahunchaa diya
 Many times it seems that society has abandoned higher education
 jab lekturer-professor ke bagair hi hindustan bhar ke karodon chaatr paas hote rahe hai to kyon na college system hi band kar diya jaae or shahar ke ek bade maidan main har maheene kii paanch taarikh ko jitne chaatr samaa jaaen, un sabko unki pasand ke vishay main paas ghoshit kar diya jaae
 With this, neither will there be any problem of having a professor nor vice-chancellor and education minister
 ham is series ke dauraan ek aise samaaj kii haalat dekh rahe hai jo dekhi nahin ja rahi he
 But imagine how comfortable our society has been watching this situation
 jaise wo maanata he ki aatma bhale amar na ho, collejon kii yah haalat amar zarur he
 But Jayanarayan Mohan Lal Purohit of Phalodi, who did not think of building a government postgraduate college building
 is college kii imaarat to shandaar he magar shandaar imaarat main bhi hamaari vyavasthaaen apni nishaani chhod detii hai
 Hemchand Purohit, who achieved success in Mumbai, felt that if there should be a good college building in his area, he built a building with 5 crores from his pocket
 kitne armaan se unhone paanch karod lagaakar aadhunik suvidhaon vaale post graduate college kaa nirmaan kara diya magar yahaan padhaane ke liye shikshak nahin hai
 There should be 16 lecturer-professors but only three
 27 karmchaaree hone chahie the magar 7 hi hai
 Students from 30-30 kilometers come here to do MA
 kareeb 2000 chaatro ke namakan ke baad bhi yahaan teacher nahin he
 The government can run a project to destroy 1900 students by depositing them in one place
 2011 main yah college bana kar sarkaar ko de diya gaya tha
 a new system has been detected in Rajasthan
 duusare zilon ke permanent shikshakon main se hi kisi ko ek-ek maheene ke liye bhej kar yahaan padhai hoti he, kabhi nahin hoti he
 Think about what dreams Seth Hemchand Purohit of Mumbai might have had when he built this building by planting five crores
 ve chaahate to itane main apni zamin par college banavaakar munafa kama sakate the, magar aise kam hi hote hai jo sarkaar ko imaarat banavaa kar dete hai
 He just wanted his father's name to remain, so the name of this college is Hemchand Jai Narayan Purohit College, if the government had not broken the trust, then how many industrialists like Hemchand would come forward and build a college and give it in the name of their district or village Giving, as people have done before
 hemchand ji na sirf is college ke liye 100 bigha zamin daan di, balki das bigha zamin main building banaakar bhi diya
 Now go from Rajasthan to Jharkhand
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa haal lete hai
 Ranchi University has been in operation since July 12, 1960
 aaj iske tahat 64 college hai
 There are 23 post graduate departments
 do lakh chaatr hai, naujavaanon kii itani jaagruk aabaadi jis universti main ho, vahaan to loktantr or vyavasthaaon ke chaal-chalan main swarna yug hi aa janaa chahie
 But even the students of Ranchi University, it seems that after three years somehow they are waiting for the degree, not the professor in the class
 yahaan ke khaali padon par sidhe bahaali honi chahie thi magar 1982 ke baad se hui hi nahin
 You are going into 21st century, Ranchi University is stuck in 20th century itself
 assistant professor pramotion paakar associat profasar phir profasar ban kar ritair hote gaye, siten khaali hoti gayi 
 Here the teacher is placed on the contract
 research scollar class lete hai
 Professors have to do administrative work as non-teaching staff are not recruited for these jobs
 mujhe is baat par shaq he ki bahut se chaatro ko pataa he ki unke professor ko padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padhata he
 Neither the professor tells nor the student asks
 sabko lagata he ki professor computer hai, on kar do, padhaanaa chaalu, isliye inase admician bhi karaao, mantri kaa swaagat bhi karaao or niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa incharge bhi banaao
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University
 koker ilaake main yah college he, 100 kattha zamin par bana he
 Since the 80s, there has been a judicial dispute over the college's land
 yah college hamaari nyaayik prakriya kii bhi misaal he
 In 40 years, this case has not reached its end
 college main bhi kisi ne sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 There cannot be a new construction here due to the stay of the Supreme Court
 yahaan par inter se lekar grajuation ke 9500 chaatr padhate hai
 With the introduction of the choice based credit system, the need of teachers in every subject has increased
 is vakt kisi bhi vishay ke liye ek yaa do se zyaada lekturer nahin hai
 According to the new system, this college needs about 150 teachers, but according to the old system, there are only 38
 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check
 shikshak kehete hai ki phir bhi ham log padhaa lete hai, magar aap samaj sakate hai ki kya padhai hoti hogi
 The college attracts children from rural areas around Ranchi
 ek chaatr to yahaan 40 kimi se rose cycle chalaakar aata he magar system use rose fail karata hoga
 One teacher told that to deal with this pressure, we have specially designed a routine so that no more than one thousand students are on campus at any given time
 im ahambadabad ke professor ko ramlakhan singh yadav college par ek adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The college is just three kilometers away from the Chief Minister's residence, but one lakh light years away from the government's eyes
 ramlakhan singh yadav bihar ke dabang netaa hue the, inke naam par kai jagahon par college he
 In our country, there was a dispute over the making of a statue of only 200 crores
 iskaa mujhe dukh he
 The demand should have been that if the idol of Ram is being built then it should be built at a cost of 20,000 crores instead of 200
 taaki duniya ko pataa chale ki ham bharat ke naujavaanon ke liye college bhale na bana sake, jo bane hue hai, unhen bhale na bachaa sake, magar murti ham chaah len to banaakar rahenge
 Our youth will not pass by studying in class, they are getting educated by watching debates on these topics in front of the TV channel
 ramlakhan singh yadav college ke principal sahab kii baat sahi he, aakhir ve kya kar sakate hai, jab koi kuch kar hi nahin rahaa he ve kya kar sakate hai
 Our colleagues Harbans and Manoj have sent the hall of a college in Dumka
 ye ek alag uniwarsity he
 Sido Kanhu Murmu University
 is uniwarsity main dumka, devgarh, godda, jamtada, pakudaur sahibganj ke 13 mahavidhyalay aate hai
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha
 Now i feel proud to tell the condition of Vinoba Bhave University in North Chotanagpur
 yahi ki hamaare aaj ke netaaon ne yaad karne ke maamle main kisi bhi netaa ko nahin choda
 On seeing the sign of anyone who has remembered, the soul trembles in the name of remembrance
 ab kuch ho kisi kii smriti main kuch bhi na bane
 There is also a shortage of 70 percent teachers in this university
 maatr 30 pratishat bache hue shikshakon ke bharose yah uniwarsity tal rahi he
 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 No one knows if there will be 70 per cent restoration, but the restoration is going to happen, hearing this, there has been a cloud of expectations
 professor ke aane kaa anumaan mausam vibhaag ke anumaan jaisaa ho gaya hai
 India will be the only country in the world where so many colleges have been opened for not teaching
 is halaat main aapako reating naam ke jhunjhane se dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki bharat main bhi duniya kii tarah reating shuru ho gai he
 Now colleges will be ranked
 is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie
 Heard that politicians have started drinking poison
 bharat ke lakhon-karodon chaatro ne uniwarsity main jaakar jo amrit piya he, usne hamaari vyavasthaaon ke saahas ko amar kar diya he or chaatro ko jarjar
 This line will be understood only when you read it four times and listen five times
 tippaniyan There is a happy news for the teachers of University
 aisa nahin he ki karaab system main khushiyaan nahin aati hai
 Come and will come
 prophessoron ke jivan main saatven vetan ayog kaa aagaman hua he, badhai
 The salary of teachers of Central University, State University and Aided College has increased
 is ghoshnaa se pataa chalaa ki bharat main 7 lakh, 58 hazaar professor hai
 i wish i could also find out how many lakh professors are not there in India
 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 aap bhi soch rahe honge ki ham tanakpur se sate banabasaa kaise pahunch gaye, darasal fasebuk par ek pathak ne hamen pahunchaa diya
 Many times it seems that society has abandoned higher education
 jab lekturer-professor ke bagair hi hindustan bhar ke karodon chaatr paas hote rahe hai to kyon na college system hi band kar diya jaae or shahar ke ek bade maidan main har maheene kii paanch taarikh ko jitne chaatr samaa jaaen, un sabko unki pasand ke vishay main paas ghoshit kar diya jaae
 With this, neither will there be any problem of having a professor nor vice-chancellor and education minister
 ham is series ke dauraan ek aise samaaj kii haalat dekh rahe hai jo dekhi nahin ja rahi he
 But imagine how comfortable our society has been watching this situation
 jaise wo maanata he ki aatma bhale amar na ho, collejon kii yah haalat amar zarur he
 But Jayanarayan Mohan Lal Purohit of Phalodi, who did not think of building a government postgraduate college building
 is college kii imaarat to shandaar he magar shandaar imaarat main bhi hamaari vyavasthaaen apni nishaani chhod detii hai
 Hemchand Purohit, who achieved success in Mumbai, felt that if there should be a good college building in his area, he built a building with 5 crores from his pocket
 kitne armaan se unhone paanch karod lagaakar aadhunik suvidhaon vaale post graduate college kaa nirmaan kara diya magar yahaan padhaane ke liye shikshak nahin hai
 There should be 16 lecturer-professors but only three
 27 karmchaaree hone chahie the magar 7 hi hai
 Students from 30-30 kilometers come here to do MA
 kareeb 2000 chaatro ke namakan ke baad bhi yahaan teacher nahin he
 The government can run a project to destroy 1900 students by depositing them in one place
 2011 main yah college bana kar sarkaar ko de diya gaya tha
 a new system has been detected in Rajasthan
 duusare zilon ke permanent shikshakon main se hi kisi ko ek-ek maheene ke liye bhej kar yahaan padhai hoti he, kabhi nahin hoti he
 Think about what dreams Seth Hemchand Purohit of Mumbai might have had when he built this building by planting five crores
 ve chaahate to itane main apni zamin par college banavaakar munafa kama sakate the, magar aise kam hi hote hai jo sarkaar ko imaarat banavaa kar dete hai
 He just wanted his father's name to remain, so the name of this college is Hemchand Jai Narayan Purohit College, if the government had not broken the trust, then how many industrialists like Hemchand would come forward and build a college and give it in the name of their district or village Giving, as people have done before
 hemchand ji na sirf is college ke liye 100 bigha zamin daan di, balki das bigha zamin main building banaakar bhi diya
 Now go from Rajasthan to Jharkhand
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa haal lete hai
 Ranchi University has been in operation since July 12, 1960
 aaj iske tahat 64 college hai
 There are 23 post graduate departments
 do lakh chaatr hai, naujavaanon kii itani jaagruk aabaadi jis universti main ho, vahaan to loktantr or vyavasthaaon ke chaal-chalan main swarna yug hi aa janaa chahie
 But even the students of Ranchi University, it seems that after three years somehow they are waiting for the degree, not the professor in the class
 yahaan ke khaali padon par sidhe bahaali honi chahie thi magar 1982 ke baad se hui hi nahin
 You are going into 21st century, Ranchi University is stuck in 20th century itself
 assistant professor pramotion paakar associat profasar phir profasar ban kar ritair hote gaye, siten khaali hoti gayi 
 Here the teacher is placed on the contract
 research scollar class lete hai
 Professors have to do administrative work as non-teaching staff are not recruited for these jobs
 mujhe is baat par shaq he ki bahut se chaatro ko pataa he ki unke professor ko padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padhata he
 Neither the professor tells nor the student asks
 sabko lagata he ki professor computer hai, on kar do, padhaanaa chaalu, isliye inase admician bhi karaao, mantri kaa swaagat bhi karaao or niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa incharge bhi banaao
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University
 koker ilaake main yah college he, 100 kattha zamin par bana he
 Since the 80s, there has been a judicial dispute over the college's land
 yah college hamaari nyaayik prakriya kii bhi misaal he
 In 40 years, this case has not reached its end
 college main bhi kisi ne sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 There cannot be a new construction here due to the stay of the Supreme Court
 yahaan par inter se lekar grajuation ke 9500 chaatr padhate hai
 With the introduction of the choice based credit system, the need of teachers in every subject has increased
 is vakt kisi bhi vishay ke liye ek yaa do se zyaada lekturer nahin hai
 According to the new system, this college needs about 150 teachers, but according to the old system, there are only 38
 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check
 shikshak kehete hai ki phir bhi ham log padhaa lete hai, magar aap samaj sakate hai ki kya padhai hoti hogi
 The college attracts children from rural areas around Ranchi
 ek chaatr to yahaan 40 kimi se rose cycle chalaakar aata he magar system use rose fail karata hoga
 One teacher told that to deal with this pressure, we have specially designed a routine so that no more than one thousand students are on campus at any given time
 im ahambadabad ke professor ko ramlakhan singh yadav college par ek adhyayan karnaa chahie

 lekin falodi ke jainarayan mohan laal purohit rajkeey snatakottar mahavidhyalay kii imaarat banane vaale ne aisa nahin sochaa
 The building of this college is magnificent, but even in the magnificent building, our systems leave their mark
 mumbai jaakar kamyaabi hasil karne vaale hemchand purohit ko laga ki unke ilaake main college kii acchhee imaarat honi chahie to apni jeb se 5 karod lagaakar imaarat bana di
 With so much armament, he has invested five crores to build a post graduate college with modern facilities but there are no teachers to teach here
 16 lekturer-professor hone chahie magar hai sirf teen
 There should have been 27 employees but there are only 7
 30-30 kilometre se chaatr yahaan eme karne aate hai
 Even after enrollment of nearly 2000 students, there is no teacher here
 1900 chaatro ko ek jagah jamaa kar barbaad karne kaa project sarkarein hi chalaa sakati hai
 In 2011, this college was formed and given to the government
 rajasthan main ek nae system kaa pataa chalaa he
 Only one of the permanent teachers of other districts is sent here for one month and studies here, never happens
 sochie mumbai ke seth hemchand purohit ne kya-kya sapane dekhe honge jab unhone paanch karod lagaakar yah imaarat banavaai hogi
 If they wanted, they could earn profits by building a college on their land, but there are very few who make the government get the building done
 unhone bas itnaa chaha ki unke pita kaa naam rah jaae isliye is college kaa naam he hemchand jai narayan purohit mahavidhyalay, agar sarkaar ne bharosa nahin todaa hota to hemchand jaise kitne hi udyogpati aage aate or college bana kar apane zile yaa gaanv ke naam par de dete, jaisaa ki pehle bhi log karte rahe hai
 Hemchand ji not only donated 100 bighas of land for this college, but also built buildings in ten bighas of land
 rajasthan se chalate hai ab jharkhand
 Lets take the position of Ranchi University
 12 july, 1960 se ranchi universti chal rahi he
 Today there are 64 colleges under it
 23 post graduate vibhaag hai
 There are two lakh students, in the university where such a conscious population of young people is, there should be a golden age in the practice of democracy and systems
 magar ranchi uniwarsity ke chaatr bhi, lagata he ki class main professor kaa nahin, teen saal baad kisi tarah degree kaa intazaar karte rah jate hai
 The vacant posts here should have been restored directly, but not since 1982
 aap 21veen sadi main ja rahe hai, ranchi uniwarsity 20veen sadi main hi fansi padi he
 After getting promotion to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor then retired as a professor and the seats were vacant
 yahaan kantrect par teacher rakhe jate hai
 Research scholars take classes
 prophessoron ko prashasnic kaam karne hote hai kyonki in kaamon ke liye non teaching staff kii bhartee nahin hoti he
 i doubt that many students know that reading to teach their professor is also teaching
 na professor bataate hai or na chaatr poochhate hai
 Everyone feels that professors are computers, turn them on, teach on, so get admission from them, welcome the minister and also make charge of essay writing competition
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai
 300 students have taken admission in history but the teacher is the same
 commers main aath sau chaatr hai, magar padhaane ke liye maatr 3 teacher hai
 The condition is that the teacher should take class or test or check the copy
 teen-teen, chaar-chaar maheenaa pariksha hoti he or phir kapi check hoti hai
 The teacher says that we still teach, but you can understand what education will be
 is college main ranchi ke aas-paas ke gramin ilaake se bachche padhane aate hai
 a student comes here cycling daily from 40 km, but the system fails him daily
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki is dabaav se nipatane ke liye hamane khaas tarah se routine banaaya he taaki kisi vakt ek hazaar se adhik chaatr campus main na ho
 The professor at IIM Ahmadabad should do a study on Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College
 yah college mukhyamantri ke awaas se maatr teen kilometre kii duuri par he magar sarkaar kii nigaah se ek lakh prakaash varsh dur he
 Ramlakhan Singh Yadav was a strong politician of Bihar, there is a college in his name
 hamaare mulk main maatr 200 karod kii murti banane par vivaad ho gaya
 i am sorry for this maang yah honi chahie tha ki ram kii murti ban rahi he to 200 kii jagah 20,000 karod kii laagat se banani chahie
 So that the world knows that we may not be able to build a college for the youth of India, may not save those who have remained, but if we wish, the idol will be built
 hamaare yuva ab class rup main padhakar paas nahin honge, ve tivi channel ke saamne in vishyon par dibet dekhte hue agucated ho rahe hai
 The principal of Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College is right, what can they do when someone is not doing anything, what can they do
 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he
 In many places, Naik's team also does a good job
 par nack or reating se kya hoga, kya aapako pataa chalegaa ki falaan college main 70 fisadi professor nahin hai
 The future of ten thousand to ten thousand students is being wasted by taking admission fees
 magar yah masalaa zaruri nahin he
 The idol should be made
 suna he netaa log zehar pine lage hai
 The nectar that millions of students of India have drank by going to university has immortalized the courage of our systems and the students are shabby
 yah pankti tabhi samaj aegi jab aap ise chaar baar padhenge or paanch baar sunenge

 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations

 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he

 Think about what dreams Seth Hemchand Purohit of Mumbai might have had when he built this building by planting five crores
 ve chaahate to itane main apni zamin par college banavaakar munafa kama sakate the, magar aise kam hi hote hai jo sarkaar ko imaarat banavaa kar dete hai
 He just wanted his father's name to remain, so the name of this college is Hemchand Jai Narayan Purohit College, if the government had not broken the trust, then how many industrialists like Hemchand would come forward and build a college and give it in the name of their district or village Giving, as people have done before
 hemchand ji na sirf is college ke liye 100 bigha zamin daan di, balki das bigha zamin main building banaakar bhi diya

 do lakh chaatr hai, naujavaanon kii itani jaagruk aabaadi jis universti main ho, vahaan to loktantr or vyavasthaaon ke chaal-chalan main swarna yug hi aa janaa chahie
 But even the students of Ranchi University, it seems that after three years somehow they are waiting for the degree, not the professor in the class

 Professors have to do administrative work as non-teaching staff are not recruited for these jobs
 mujhe is baat par shaq he ki bahut se chaatro ko pataa he ki unke professor ko padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padhata he
 Neither the professor tells nor the student asks
 sabko lagata he ki professor computer hai, on kar do, padhaanaa chaalu, isliye inase admician bhi karaao, mantri kaa swaagat bhi karaao or niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa incharge bhi banaao
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University

 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check

 In our country, there was a dispute over the making of a statue of only 200 crores

 Our youth will not pass by studying in class, they are getting educated by watching debates on these topics in front of the TV channel

 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he

 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there

 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole

 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
