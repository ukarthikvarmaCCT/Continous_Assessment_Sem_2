 The Supreme Court said in a very important judgment on Monday that the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory in the case of welfare schemes, although in the case of income tax or non-beneficial schemes, the government can ask for the Aadhaar card

 How difficult it has been for Team India to take England's score to 500 in the first cross of Rajkot Test can be gauged from the fact that the foreign team crossed this (500's) mark in India for the 25th time
 is
 pichley 24 baar bharat kabhi bhi jeet hasil nahin kar sakaa
 Team India players missed several catches in the first innings, due to which it was very easy for England players to reach this score
 lekin pehali pari main shatak lagane vaale olerounder moin ali ne isi baat par jor daalkar shaayad ek mind game bhi khilne kii koshish kii he
 After the end of the second day's play in Rajkot, Moin Ali said, 'we have done this before
 aisa cricket main hota he
 But the catches were untouched and became our rhythm during the day
 lekin cricket main aisa hota he or mujhe yakeen he khilaadi (team india ke) is par kaam kar rahe honge
 ' darasal bhartiya filders ne match ke pehle din pehle hi ghante main teen kaich chhod die
 Not only this, on the second day Ben Stokes missed two catches (riddhiman Saha and Umesh Yadav scored 60 and 61) and Stokes scored 128 runs in the innings
 rajkot test ke pehle din pehle hi over main mohammad shami kii gend par elister cook kaa kaich gali main chuta
 Then in the second over, Virat Kohli could not catch a catch off Umesh Yadav
 in sabake alaava bhi bhartiya filding kaa str umdaa nahin kaha ja saktaa jise lekar team management zarur fikramand hogi
 But Moin Ali has tried to create a different pressure on Team India by emphasizing this in the press conference
 yahaan tak ki purv captain sunil gavaskar ne bhi bhartiya team kii filding kii aalochana kii
 Speaking to NDTV, Gavaskar said, "apart from Ajinkya Rahane on the field, the rest of the players stand with their hands on their knees which is not the right technique
 australia or da
 In Africa, the ball comes above the waist
 lekin bharat kii pichon par gend ghutanon se neeche aati he
 Therefore it is important to stand down
 'tippaniyan Earlier, Moin Ali, who has taken 88 wickets in 32 Tests, also said that the bounce and crack of the pitch can help his bowling
 baayen haath ke ballebaaz or daaen haath ke is of spinner ne kaha, 'is pich kii oochaal kam ho rahi he
 Pitch cracks are opening
 pich main spin bhi thi
 This pitch was good yesterday and today
 mujhe lagata he is pich kii oochaal mushkilen paidaa karegi
 He also said that the pitch here is completely different from Bangladesh
 lekin ye bhi kaha ki unhen pataa he ki yahaan kii pichen unke liye aage bhi mushkil hone ja rahi hai
 The 29-year-old all-rounder from Birmingham said that he sets off by aiming to play 200 balls
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki agar wo 200 genden khel lete hai to wo shatak bana sakate hai
 He told that he also wants to play his role well as a spinner
 unhone ye bhi ummid jataai ki match main nateeja nikalegaa
 That is, the challenges have increased for Team India chasing 474 mountain without losing any wicket
 jaisaa ki match shuru hone se pehle captain viraat kohli ne captain elister cook ke bayaan (cook ne apni team ko anderdog kaa tamgaa diya tha) par kaha tha ki wo england kii baton par fokas nahin rakhana chaahate
 It should be hoped that this time too, Team India will be working on a plan to implement its plan in a concrete way in the dressing room
 team india ke khilaadiyon ne pehali pari main kai kaich chode jisaki vajah se england ke khilaadiyon ko is score tak pahunchane main bahut aasaani hui
 But all-rounder Moin Ali, who scored a century in the first innings, has probably tried to play a mind game too, by emphasizing the same thing
 rajkot main duusare din kaa khel khatm hone ke baad moin ali ne kaha, 'hamane aisa pehle bhi kiya he
 It happens in cricket
 lekin kaich chute or din main hamaari lay ban gai
 But this happens in cricket and i am sure the players (of Team India) will be working on it
 ' In fact, Indian fielders gave up three catches in the very first hour of the match
 yahi nahin, duusare din ben stokes ke do kaich chute (60 or 61 ke score par riddhimaan saaha or umesh yadav ne chode kaich) or stokes ne pari main sabase zyaada 128 ran bana liye
 Alastair Cook's catch from Mohammed Shami in the first over of the first day of the Rajkot Test was caught in the street
 phir duusare over main umesh yadav kii gend par viraat kohli kaich lapak nahin paye
 Apart from all this, the level of Indian fielding cannot be said to be good, for which the team management will definitely be concerned
 lekin moin ali ne press conference main is baat par jor daalkar team india par shaayad ek alag dabaav banane kii koshish kii he
 Even former captain Sunil Gavaskar criticized the fielding of the Indian team
 NDTV se baat karte hue gavaskar ne kaha, 'maidan par ajinkya rahane ke alaava baaqi khilaadi ghutanon par haath rakh kar khadey hote hai jo sahi takanic nahin he
 Australia and The
 africa main gend qamar se upar aati he
 But on India's pitches the ball comes down from the knees
 isliye jhuk kar khadey hona zaruri he
 Comments isse pehle 32 test main 88 wicket le chuke moin ali ne ye bhi kaha ki pich kii oochaal or daraar unki gendbaazi ko madad kar sakati he
 The left-handed batsman and right-handed off-spinner said, "the bounce of this pitch is decreasing
 pich kii daraar khul rahi he
 The pitch also had spin
 ye pich kal or aaj acchhee thi
 i think the bounce of this pitch will cause problems
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki yahaan kii pich bangladesh se bilkul alag he
 But he also said that he knows that the pitches here are going to be difficult for him even further
 birmingham ke 29 saal ke is olerounder ne kaha ki wo 200 gend khilne kaa lakshya banaakar utarate hai
 He also said that if he plays 200 balls, he can score a century
 unhone bataaya ki wo bataur spinner bhi apana role acchhee tarah adaa karnaa chaahate hai
 He also hoped that the match would result
 yani bina koi wicket khoe 474 ke pahaad kaa peechha kar rahi team india ke liye chunautiyaan bad gai hai
 As captain Virat Kohli said on the statement of captain Alastair Cook (cook had given his team the title of underdog) before the match started, he did not want to focus on England's things
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki is baar bhi team india dressing room main apane plan ko thos tareeke se lagu karne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi hogi
 In fact, Indian fielders gave up three catches in the very first hour of the match

 Anand said that today everyone will have to work together for the development of education and education without discrimination
 algaav se kabhi khushi nahin aa sakati
 In order to throw light on the Super 30, Anand gave the example of many children reaching high positions by learning in this institution and said that the disadvantaged children need to be shown the means and the way
 unhone kaha ki aaj auto rickshaw chaalak, majdoor or krishak ke bachche iaiti main pravesh paa rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that the success of Anand's organization 'super 30', which has helped the underprivileged sections of the society to get success in the prestigious IIT entrance exam, will be seen in the film 'the Big Day' by the famous French director Pascal Plesson
 is film main banaras ke ek auto chaalak kii beti nidhi jha kii kahani bhi he, jo abhi iesaim, dhanbad main pard rahi he
 The important session of the Panchayat Gujarat program was held in the attack on development this time by Union Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today televijan ke managing editor rahul kanwal ne kii
 Sitharaman said whether the Congress can explain why it took just 45 days to confer Bharat Ratna on Rajiv Gandhi and 41 years in giving Bharat Ratna to Sardar Patel
 kya gujarat model puure desh ke liye ek misaal he yaa sirf gujarat main vikaas pagalaa gaya he
 Nirmala Sitharaman said that it is a fact that Gujarat model is a successful model for development
 sitaraman ne kaha ki congress kaa yah dushprachaar ki gujarat main vikaas pagalaa gaya he yah ek bhadda majaak he
 Any one national party that should be involved in the debate by being serious is making fun of it in this way
 sitaraman ne kaha ki aaj desh main vikaas ek syrius ishyu he
 The Congress should have come out and debated in front of the Gujarat model by doing its own model so that the country can be developed on the basis of a model
 lekin congress party ab raajnneeti ke bade muddon par bhi majaak karnaa pasand karti he
 ALSO READ: EXCLUSIVE: In response to Amit Shah's clarification on the questions raised on Jai Shah's company for the first time, the Congress leader said that the politics of jumle in the country has been started by BJP leaders
 gujarat kii raajnneeti par bolte hue surajevaala ne kaha ki jab daliton par atyaachaar hoga, logon ko naukari nahin di jaaegi or yuva dar-dar kii thokaren khayega to aisi sthiti main vikaas kaa pagal hona laazmi he
 Surjewala said that Gujarat has now lagged behind on issues like education, health and employment
 gujarat main vikaas ke pagal hone ke tanj kaa jawaab dete hue nirmala ne kaha ki aakhir aisa hota to kyon bijepi ek ke baad ek rajyon main chunaav jeet rahi he
 Nirmala pulled the Congress leader and said that the Narmada issue on which the Congress is screaming today, did his government not allow water to reach Gujarat through this Narmada project
 haalanki surajevaala ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ke mantri ko puri jaankaree nahin he
 This dam was built only because the Congress Chief Minister gave the land to build it
 nirmala ne kaha ki jab gujarat main modi sarkaar ke dauraan pehali baar sarplus power hua or vah us sarplus power ko maharashtra ko bechakar apane yahaan vikaas kii gati ko tej karnaa chahta tha tab kyon congress sarkaar ne yah sauda nahin hone diya
 Did the Congress not do this to fail the Gujarat model? congress netaa ne bijepi ke congress mukt bharat ke slogan par bolaa ki loktantr ke andar kaise koi sattarudh party vipaksh ke saath milakar kaam karne ke bajaae vipaksh ko khatm kar dene kii baat karti he
 Is this the democratic understanding of the BJP that there should be only one party in the country and no one in the opposition
 rojgaar ke mudde par bolte hue surajevaala ne kaha ki jis raftaar se modi sarkaar aapnaa vaada puraa karne ke liye naukari de rahi he usase to desh main sabhi berozegaron ko naukari dene main 250 saal lagenge
 At the same time, with this form of demonetisation and GST, the Modi government has increased the number of unemployed
 aise main modi sarkaar apane model se kaise nai naukariyaan paidaa karne ja rahi he
 Cashless became a big support when demonetisation closed the doors of cash, but after 42 days, cashless has become a big problem for many traders
 cashles pement ke liye swip mashin kaa istemaal main kamjor network ek badi samasya banakar khadaa ho rahaa he
 Aaj Tak's team took stock of the largest electronic market in Chandni Chowk, in this market, everything from colorful skirting to bulbs, tube lights, electrical wires, switches and household items are sold
 jammu kashmir se lekar kanyakumari tak ke vyapaaree yahaan se thok kaa vyapaar karte hai
 Jeetu, who runs a shop here, says that he has been running the shop for the last 12 years, he ordered an swipe machine only after 2 days of demonetisation
 jitu ke mutabik footkar vyapaaree ke paas cash nahin he to wo debit yaa credit card lekar aate hai lekin dikkat ye aa rahi he ki sarwar kamjor he, shanivaar kii shaam ko ek graahak ke 50 hajaar rupye swip kiye, unke acount se to rupye cat gaye lekin mere paas balance nahin aayaa
 Jeetu tells the condition of a customer that after the rupee is deducted, when the payment is not made, the customer keeps calling customer care
 sarwar na hone kii vajah se customer ko kai ghante tak baithna bhi padataa he, abtak 3 se 4 customer ke saath aisa hua
 Once the card was not swiped, the error was coming again and again
 jitu kii maane to cash bahut acha he, cash se aaraam rahata he turant lenden ho jaataa he
 There is also a problem in taking the check because if the buyer is not knowledgeable, then there is a fear of the check being bounced
 ajtak kii team abhikashaleska test kar hi rahi thi ki jitu kii dukaan par lakhanu se aae pradeep dukaan par apana card swip karke pement karte nazar aae, pradeep hafte main 2 baar lakhanu se dilli aate hai
 Previously used to bring cash but now bring the card, Pradeep says that now he swiped the card but the error has come, i have to pay 15 thousand but no cash
 upi police ne ek aise hatyakand kaa khulaasa kiya he, jisamen shuru main mana ja rahaa tha ki gang nahar main doobane se do yuvakon kii maut hui he
 However, when the police investigation proceeded, the murder was revealed
 thana sector 24 kii police ne city centre ke paas se shuukravaar ko hatya ke aaropee ko giraftaar kiya he
 Police arrested Saurabh has been arrested for the murder of his friend
 police ke anusaar saurabh, nagendra chouhan urf mintu or bhaanu pratap teenon dost the
 Mintu had a bad eye on Saurabh's sister and used to talk dirty things about her
 iske alaava mintu ne saurabh ko lagbhag 5 lakh 50 hajaar rupee kaa karj diya tha
 Because of this, Saurabh did not know much about the wrong things Mintu had said to his sister
 saurabh koi kaam dhandha nahin karata tha or zyaadaatar mintu par hi ashrith tha
 Two to three days before the murder incident, Mintu uttered wrong things about Saurabh's sister in return for forgiving the debt, which led to Saurabh's hatred for Mintu and he decided to hide Mintoo's whereabouts
 police ne bataaya ki 23 june ko mintu kii dukaan kii baraabar main kaam karne vaale motorsikil mistre kapheel ke saale kii rampur muradabad main shaadi thi
 In it, Saurabh, Bhanu and Mintu were supposed to go, but Bhanu and Mintu refused to go to the wedding
 tab saurabh ne gang nahar main nahaane ke bahanemuradanagarle jane kii yojana banaai
 According to the plan, Mintu and Bhanu agreed to go to Muradnagar
 unhone bataaya ki teenon dost sharaab pite hue muradanagar gang nahar ghat par nahaane ke liye pahunche
 At the behest of Saurabh, he started taking selfie a little further inside the canal, where Bhanu and Mintu started drowning together
 donon ko duubataa dekh vahaan maujuud gotakhoron ne dub rahe mintu ko baahar nikaal liya or bhaanu ko bhi dhund liya
 Saurabh helped Mintu and Bhanu lie on the back seat of the car and ran away with Mintu on the pretext of taking Bhanu to the hospital without knowing his condition
 meerut road par muradanagar paar karne ke baad gajiabad kii taraf road ke kinare gaadi roki, tab tak andhera ho chukaa tha
 Saurabh fired at the car's Diggi and hit Mintoo's head
 mintu kii maut kaa vishwaas hone ke baad usne shav ko musuri se aage khichraa gaanv ke paas nahar main kinare gira diya, taaki aisa lage ki mintu kii maut doobane se hui he or shav bahakar aayaa he
 Accused Saurabh later came to know that Bhanu was taken out of the canal and admitted to the hospital, where he too died
 pulicene sector-48 ke kashyap colony nivasee saurabh ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he
 The Swift car used in the slaughter has also been recovered from his possession
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla nifjal guru ko faansidie jane kii tikhi aalochana karte hue kaha ki isse ghati ke yuvaaon kii pidiyon main phir se algaav or anyaay kii bhaavana paidaa hogi
 Omar said that it is 'sad' that the Guru was not allowed to meet his family before the execution and final farewell was also not allowed
 sansad par hamalaa maamle main abhiyukt afjal guru shanivaar ko gopneey prakriya main faansee de di gayi or tihaad jail parisar main hi dafnaaya diya gaya
 Appearing angry with Afzal's hanging, Omar said that there were many questions that needed to be answered
 umr ne kaha ki afjal kii faansee kaa dderghaavadhik nihitarth ‘kaaphi chintajanak’ he kyonki ve kashmir main yuvaaon kii nayi peedi se sambandhit hai jo makabool bhatta maamle se nahin parichit hon lekin ve afjal se parichit honge
 Bhatt was hanged in 1984 in the murder case of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mahatre in Britain
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki kripaya yah samajhie ki kashmiriyon kii ek se adhik peedi he jo apane ko peedit ke rup main dekhati he, jo apane ko us shrenee ke logon main dekhte hai jinhen nyaay nahin milegaa
 Omar said whether you like it or not, Afzal's hanging reinforces the point that there is no justice for him (the new generation) and that i think it is more worrying and disturbing than the immediate implication of security
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki unke paas iskaa koi jawaab nahin he ki ham kis prakaar anyaay or algaav kii unki dharna dur kar sakenge
 Omar, while stating himself against the death penalty, said that as long as the law provides for capital punishment, action should not be taken on selective grounds
 yah puche jane par ki kya samprag sarkaar ne afjal ko faansee dekar chuninda aadhaar par karrwai kii, umr ne kaha ki yah kashmiriyon or duniya ke saamne sabit karnaa hoga ki afjal kii faansee chuninda aadhaar par kii gayi karrwai nahin thi
 He said that i felt that if not today, Afzal will be hanged tomorrow
 kashmiriyon kii peediyaan afjal se parichit hongi
 You have to prove to the world that capital punishment has not been used on selective basis
 yah jimmedaari nyaaypalika or raajnneetik netritv par he ki yah faansee chuninda aadhaar par nahin thi
 The Chief Minister agreed that many believe that Afzal's hearing was flawed
 unhone kaha ki desh ke shesh hisse main bhi kai aise swar hai jo aisi hi raay rakhte hai
 Omar said that if the Center wants to defend itself from the allegation that Afzal's execution was political rather than legal, he will have to answer questions about other accused who have been sentenced to death
 unhone kaha ki kai anya ko bhi maut kii sajaa sunaayi gayi he jo loktantr par hamalaa main shaamil rahe hai
 He asked whether the Chief Minister of any state is not a symbol of democracy? Is no former prime minister a symbol of democracy? Of course, they are
 vah paroksh rup se purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or punjab ke mukhyamantri beant singh ke hatyaron se jude maamalon kaa zikr kar rahe the
 Omar said that many questions need to be answered
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle main istemaal kiye gaye shabdon ko samajhnaa kathin he
 In the judgment, the collective conscience has to be satisfied
 aap samuhik vivek ko santusht karne ke liye kisi ko faansee nahin de sakate
 Rather it has to meet legal requirements
 faansee ke pehle parivaar se nahin milane dene ke bare main umr ne kaha ki maanviya aadhaar par yah is faansee kaa dukhad paksh he
 The Chief Minister questioned the justification for informing Afzal's family through post and said that the credibility of this medium is under question
 unhone kaha ki agar ham kisi ko dak se yah soochna de rahe hai ki uske parivaar ke sadsy ko faansee kii sajaa di ja rahi he to nishchit rup se vyavastha main kuch gambhir gadabadi he
 Omar said that there are many other people who have already been sentenced to death
 ab main samajhataa hum ki aapane sansad par hamalaa maamle main guru ko faansee de di he or aap kehete hai ki sansad loktantr kaa pratik he
 Got it and no more debate
 unhone is baat par chintaa jataayi ki unki sarkaar ko sirf 12 ghante pehle faansee ke bare main bataaya gaya
 He said that he is sad that Afzal's family was not informed at the right time

 Mobile phone service provider Tata Docomo has started a per-second billing facility for roaming across the country: Airtel had last week announced a steep reduction in roaming fee rates
 company ne ravivaar ko jari bayaan main kaha ki uski nai peshkash kisi bhi network par mobile yaa landline phone par sabhi inakming or outgowing local or astidi sarvice ke liye he
 Currently, operators charge a roaming fee per minute and this charge varies depending on the place and network
 tata docomo kii is pahal se roming shulk ke maamle main mobile companiyon ke bich compitishan badhegaa
 Earlier, Tata Docomo had introduced a paisa per second scheme for local and STD calls, forcing other companies to introduce the facility
 ritair justise e ke patnayak kaa bayaan aayaa he ki unhen verma ke kilaaf kendriya satarkta ayukta kii report main bhrashtachar ke koi pramaan nahin mili the
 The Supreme Court had asked Justice Patnaik to investigate the CVC report
 patnayak ne chaudaa dinon ke bheetar jaanch kar apni report supreme court ko saunp di thi
 He also gave Verma an opportunity to present his case
 yah bhi kaha ki sivisi ne special diarector rakesh asthana ke sin kiye hue bayaan to bheje lekin asthana ne unke saamne aisa bayaan nahin diya
 Justice Patnaik's statement is printed in the Indian Express
 unhone seemaa chishti se baatcheet main ye sab kaha he
 He says the report of the Central Vigilance Commissioner is not the last word
 justise patnayak kaa bayaan he ki maine apni report main kaha he ki kendriya satarkta ayukta kii report main lagaae gaye kisi aarope main bhrashtachar ke pramaan nahin mili hai
 Justice Patnaik gave this report to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Ranjan Gogoi
 justise patnayak ne yah bhi kaha ki supreme court ne kaha bhi tha ki hai power cameti nirnay le to bhi itani jaldbaazi main faisalaa nahin lenaa chahie tha
 Especially when the Supreme Court judges were there, the committee should have thought deeply
 ab yahaan samajhnaa hoga
 The Supreme Court asked Justice Patnaik to investigate the cases against Verma
 justise patnayak ne apni report de di to us report par supreme court ne apana stand kyon nahin liya? kya hai power cameti ne supreme court ke aadesh se bani justise patnayak kii report par vichaar kiya? kya patnayak kii report se zyaada mahatv sivisi kii report ko diya? kya justise sikri ne supreme court kii report par koi stand liya?to is maamle main kya hua? sivisi ne verma ke kilaaf aaropon kii suchi banaai
 The government removed Verma
 verma supreme court jate hai
 The Supreme Court says that the material that the CVC has presented against Verma is insufficient to remove him from the post
 verma behaal kar die jate hai
 Now the committee headed by the Prime Minister removes Verma based on the same unproven allegations
 sarkaar samarthak bhakt soshal media par prachaar karte hai ki justise sikri ne bhi sivisi ko report ko sahi mana
 The needle of suspicion was on the Prime Minister that he wanted to remove Verma to stop the investigation in the Rafale case
 verma ko hataane kii pehali koshish supreme court main safal nahin hui thi
 Therefore, to save the Prime Minister, devotees are resorting to the vote of Justice Sikri
 udhar special diarector rakesh asthana dilli hai court pahunche the ki unke kilaaf verma ne jo exiaar darj karai thi, use nirast kiya jaae
 On the contrary, the Delhi High Court has ordered the CBI to complete the investigation within ten weeks
 ab aap ek or chiz par gaur karen
 Everything is being managed before your eyes
 sansthaaen ghulaam ho chuki hai
 The media has become the dock media
 phir bhi amit shah ko kyon dar lagata he ki 2019 main haar gaye to ghulaam ho jaaenge? kya ve bhaajapa ke kaaryakartaaon ko daraa rahe hai? jeet ke prati josh bharne kaa yah koun sa tareeqa hua ki haar jaaenge to ghulaam ho jaaenge? iske pehle bhi bijepi haari he, kya uske kaaryakarta ghulaam ho gaye the? rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main kya ghulaam ho gaye hai?amit shah ko kiski ghulaami kaa dar sata rahaa he? kahin ve apane gunahon ke itane ghulaam to nahin ho chuke hai ki haar se dar lagane laga he? kya amit shah ko bhi bharat kii mahaan sena or sansthaaon par bharosa nahin he? phir ve kyon kehete hai ki 2019 main haar gaye to do sau saal kii ghulaami aa jaaegi? dilli main amit shah ne kaha he ki 2019 kii ladaai panipat kii teesri ladaai he
 Two hundred years of slavery came after the Marathas were defeated
 amit shah apane raajnneeti pratidwandvi ko kabhi saanp chhuchhuundar kutta billi bolte hai to kabhi ahamed shah abdali bataane lagate hai
 Does BJP consider its opponents Ahmed Shah Abdali? What are the grounds for believing this? Has Amit Shah survived similar metaphors and slogans that fit the mold of communalism? BJP workers should think
 kahin aisa to nahin ki unke samarpan ko amit shah ne ghulaami main badal diya he
 If Amit Shah asks to jump into the ditch, then he will jump into the ditch
 paanch saal ke baad kya koi bhi kaam nahin hua jise lekar janata ke bich ja saken? kya janata ke bich jane ke liye ghulaami or panipat kii teesri ladaai jaise roopak hi bache hai?supreme court ne jis tarah alok verma ke maamle main spasht faisalaa nahin diya, apane hi aadesh se bani patnayak report par vichaar nahin kiya, alok verma ko hataaya gaya, uske pehle jai shah kii khabar dabaai gai, jaj loya kii khabaron par pardaa daalaa gaya, soharabuddin encounter maamle main sab bari hote gaye
 Azam Khan makes a statement about the killers of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya, all silenced
 rafaal maamle main supreme court ne us sieji report kaa zikr kar diya jise sansad kii sthai samiti main pesh hi nahin kiya gaya
 Neither the Supreme Court says anything nor the government
 sibiai or chunaav ayog kaa istamaal kar do saal tak aam aadmi party ke bees vidhayakon ke kilaaf cese chalaaya gaya, media main is dar ko bada kiya gaya ki ab aap kii sarkaar gir jaaegi
 Do you know where all those cases are? This list of crimes can be longer
 magar amit shah ko haar jane par ghulaami kaa dar kyon sata rahaa he? shah or modi to shahenshaah hai
 Why do they have to scare the workers to win now? Look, feel that if you lose or else we will be enslaved
 kaaryakarta ne aisa kya kiya he ki use haarane par ghulaami kaa dar hona chahie? kya netaaon ne kuch aisa kiya he

 Today is the birthday of Sushant Singh Rajput, who completed the journey from small screen to big screen with success
 jaaniye, unke bare main kuch dilachasp baaten
 
 
 Birthday Special: Engineering was left for acting in films
 
 
 sushantne acting main kadam rakhane se pehle 11 neshnal ejineering imtahaan paas kiye hai
 Shuddh Desi Hero was part of the group that performed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games

 The actress, who is training to fly airplanes for the shooting of the film, started traveling with the character of Preet in the upcoming TV series 'kiss Desh Mein Hai Mera Dil'
 dilli vishvavidhyalay chaatrasangh chunaav aate hi jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay kii tarah yahaan bhi ‘presidential dibet’ karaane kii charchaa hone lagati he, lekin is baar bhi yahaan presidential dibet sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 While 'presidential Debate' is going to be held at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke nirvachan adhikari dow
 In the opinion of Satish Kumar, this university does not have a suitable environment for 'presidential Debate'
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ‘presidential dibet’ ko lekar kisi bhi chaatr sanghathan kii taraf se vishvavidhyalay prashasan ko koi likhit aagrah nahin mila he
 Jawaharlal Nehru University and University of Delhi are counted among the prestigious universities not only in Delhi but also in the country and abroad
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ kii parampara rahi he, jo dilli vishvavidhyalay main nahin hoti
 Refusing the question of making 'presidential Debate' in Delhi University, the Election Officer of this University, Dr
 satish kumaar ne kaha, ‘is vishvavidhyalay kaa khulaa parisar ‘presidential dibet’ ke liye sabase badi baadha he
 The area of colleges here is also large, due to which it will be difficult to control the NSUI, ABVP cadres in large numbers
 'unhone kaha ki kai baar abivipi or enesayuai kaaryakartaaon ke bich takaraav kii khabaren aati hai or ‘presidential dibet’ ke dauraan aisi sthiti utpann hone par vishvavidhyalay ke liye pareshaani ho sakati he
 However, we have not received any request from anyone yet regarding 'presidential Debate'
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari professor di
 s
 ravat ne kaha, ‘is vishvavidhyalay main presidential dibet to nahin hoti, lekin chaatr sanghathanon ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke saamudayik radio channel ‘dilli vishvavidhyalay community radio’ (diusiaar) par chunaav prachaar kii ijaajat he
 Just, propaganda should not spread any violence
 pichley saal bhi hamane sanghathanon ko diusiaar par prachaar karne kii ijaajat di thi
 This year, no such demand has come from any organization
 ’diusiaar kii program manager vijayalakshmi sinha ne kaha, ‘dilli vishvavidhyalay ke saamudayik radio channel par chaatr sanghathanon ko prachaar kii ijaajat he, lekin ve kisi bhi tarah kii raajnneeti se prerit yaa hinsa failaane vaali baaten nahin kar sakate
 For this, we first see his screenplay and then he is allowed to speak on the radio
 pichley saal bhi aisa hua tha
 However, this time we have not yet asked for time to campaign on behalf of any organization
 ’vahiin das sitambar ko apane ghoshnaa patr jari karne ke dauraan akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ke adhyaksh pad ke pratyaashee ankit choudhary ne kaha tha ki unka sanghathan vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ kaa pakshdhar he lekin vishvavidhyalay prashasan kii taraf se unhen sahyog nahin mil rahaa
 On the other hand NSUI says that they will take any step as per the recommendations of Lyngdoh Committee
 isa (ol india students association) kii adhyaksh pad kii pratyaashee nikita sinha kaa kahana he ki unka sanghathan bhi jawaharlal nehru vishvidhyalay kii tarah dilli vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ karaane kaa pakshdhar he lekin vishvavidhyalay prashasan kaa ravaiya thik nahin he
 SFI (student Federation of India) Presidential candidate Kamal Kumar Arya is also in favor of 'presidential Debate'
 aarope pratyarope ke is daur main dilli vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ kii charchaa jor pakad rahi he
 The wide scope of colleges has been cited as an important reason for not having a 'presidential debate' in the university
 haalanki chaatr sanghathanon dwaara vishvavidhyalay ke band parisar kii bhi maang uthati rahi he
 This time too, the major student organization NSUI has again raised the demand for closed campus in its manifesto
 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke chaara ghotaale main jail jane ke baad party kii bagdor unke chote bete or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne sanbhali he, magar tejasvi yadav kaa netritv party ke kai sheersh netaaon ko nagavar guzar rahaa he
 After taking charge of Tejashwi's party, former party spokesman Ashok Kumar Sinha left the party on Tuesday
 ashok sinha ne kaha ki unhen tejasvi kaa netritv sweekaar nahin he or isi vajah se vah party chhod rahe hai
 Speaking on the steps taken by Ashok Kumar Sinha against Tejashwi Yadav, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has tweeted that many senior leaders of the party are feeling suffocated under Tejashwi's leadership and very soon he will also leave the party
 modi ne kaha ki party ke bade netaa party chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai or keval makul vakt kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Modi said that Tejashwi Yadav has become so restless due to the ruckus inside the RJD that he is making unrestrained statements against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 modi ne kaha ki argedy khud tut kii kagaar par he or aise main tejasvi yadav bevajaah NDA main tut kaa bhram failaa rahe hai
 Taking a dig at the stunning Modi said that seeing the split in the house of another does not erase the cracks in his house

 Sushil Modi said that if a Dalit is killed in the Bihar government, then his dependents are given state government 8
 50 lakh or dushkarm peedita ko 5 lakh rupye muaavja diya ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, tweeting on the issue of holding the elections of Lok Sabha and all the assemblies together, Modi said that the idea of holding both the elections of the central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi together is wise
 jis tareeke se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi loksabhaa or sabhi vidhansabhaon ke chunaav ko ek saath karaane ko lekar sahmati jataai he, uskaa bhi modi ne swaagat kiya he
 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement, Pakoras are discussed in the central politics of the country
 modi ne haal hi main apane ek tivi intervyuu main kaha tha ki pakora bechakar roj 200 rupee kamaane waalon ko bhi naukrishuda logon main gina ja saktaa he
 This statement was targeted by the Congress leaders
 ab bijepi ne modi ke is bayaan ko apni pratishtha kaa prashn bana liya he
 On Monday, BJP President and Rajya Sabha MP Amit Shah in his first speech made a statement around this statement of Modi
 darasal, is bayaan ke baad modi tamaam vipakshi netaaon ke nishane par aa gaye the or amit shah or bijepi modi ke isi bayaan ke bachaav main utar aae hai
 Why is there a ruckus? Actually, before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress and the BJP had promised that if their government comes, crores of jobs will be created every year
 congress ko to sarkaar banane kaa mauka nahin mila, par bijepi sarkaar main he to log usee se hisaab maang rahe hai
 Narendra Modi, then the PM candidate, had said at a rally in Agra in 2013 that his government would give employment to one crore people every year
 ab centre sarkaar bane kareeb chaar puure hone ko hai, isliye vipakshi partiyaan isi sawaal ko lekar bijepi par hamalavar hai
 70 lakh jobs and 'pakoda self-employment'
 Recently, two economists Palak Ghosh and Soumya Kanti Ghosh claimed based on registration data in EPFO, ESIC, NPS and GPF that 70 lakh and unorganized sector of organized sector in 2017-18 80 lakh jobs will be created
 iske baad se centre sarkaar in aankadon kaa hawala dekar apana vaada puraa karne kaa daawa kar rahi he
 However, there is a dispute over these figures and both economists acquiring them
 isi ke aasapaas piem modi ne apane ek tivi intervyuu main inhen aankadon ke hawaale se 70 lakh rojgaar kaa hawala diya tha or kaha tha ki sadak kinare pakora bechney vaale panjikrut rojgaar kii suchi main nahin aate, par ve bhi paise kama rahe hai or parivaar paal rahe hai
 Questions were raised on the figures: The employment figures of the two million economists mentioned above were questioned by other economists
 inamen jairam ramesh, praveen chakravarti purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram etc
 chidambaram ne ek lekh main kaha tha ki 150 lakh rojgaar paidaa hone se aane vaale dinon main desh main rojgaar kii samasya nahin rah jaaegi
 Chidambaram had said that China's GDP is five times bigger than India and if it is able to provide only 150 lakh jobs in a year, then the number of such jobs in India is doubtful
 jairam ramesh or praveen chakravarti ne kaha tha ki EPFO main panjikaran kaa matlab ek asangathit rojgaar kaa sangathit kshetra main aana hota he, na ki nayaa rojgaar bananaa
 Pichidambaram, who targeted Chidambaram with 'begging employment', tweeted after Modi's pakoda employment statement, 'the Prime Minister said that selling pakoda is also employment
 us tark se to bheekh maangana bhi rojgaar he
 Let us consider the poor or the handicapped as forced to beg to live
 ' bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne somvaar ko chidambaram ke is bayaan par kaha ki pakora bananaa koi shame kii baat nahin he
 He said that it is a shame not to make pakodas, but to compare the pakodas maker with beggars
 shah ne kaha ki jaise ek chaay bechney vaala desh kaa pradhanmantri bana he, vaise pakora vaale kaa betaa bhi aage jaakar kuch ban saktaa he
 Earlier, there was a dispute over 'chaiwala' PM
 Earlier, a Congress leader's statement that Modi was 'worth selling tea' was made a question of his reputation by Modi and BJP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle narendra modi ko bijepi kii ore se piem pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya gaya tha
 After this, in January 2014, at the Congress session, Mani Shankar Aiyar had said, "it is not possible for Modi to become the PM, but if he wants, he can come and sell tea in the Congress session
" ' is maamle ko bhi bijepi or modi ne apni pratishtha kaa prashn bana liya tha or tab se modi lagbhag sabhi jansabhaon main kehete the ki loktantr kuch pariwaron tak simat gaya he or kuch log yah nahin chaahate hai ki chaay bechney vaala (vah khud) desh kaa piem bane
 Since 2013, Modi used to say in his rallies, 'if the country seller (congress leader) can become the PM, then why not the tea seller?' After the tea, the 'pakoda strategy' can be made
 Later, BJP took a lot of mileage
 loksabhaa chunaavon main 'chaay par charchaa' jaise kai kaarykram shuru kiye the
 Modi tea worth Rs 1 was being sold in many cities
 is baar bijepi ke nishane par pi
 Chidambaram
 loksabhaa chunaavon or aath rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main zyada samay nahin bachaa he
 It may be that in the coming days, after tea, pakodas may also be included in the bjp's election strategy
 bharat ne vishwa ke sabase bade telescope kii mejabani karne kaa avasar gavaan diya he
 There was a lot of speculation that the 30-meter Giant Telescope (TMT) would be given a high altitude remote location in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir
 iskaa netritv kar rahe ek bahu-deshiy gathbandhan ke sadasyon ne is saptaah yah faisla kiya ki is telescope ko atlantic mahaasaagar main sthit canneri dweepasmooh par banaaya jayega
 The telescope, which will be activated in the year 2025, will cost more than two billion dollars
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki yah pradhanmantri narendra modi kii pasandida pariyojna thi
 Within four months of assuming office, the TMT project was supported by the NDA and was one of the first major science projects approved by PM Modi's cabinet
 is vrihad vaishvik kaary kaa pramukh uddeshy brahmad kii utpatti or gupt urja kaa adhyayan karnaa he
 a report from the Government of India said that through TMT, scientists will be able to study objects far away from the Earth in the universe, which gives information about the early stages of the evolution of the universe
 isse vaigyanikon ko paas ke pindon ke bare main bhi acchhee jaankaree milegi
 These bodies are planets or bodies of the solar system, which have not yet been discovered

 The preferred place to install the TMT was Maua Kiya, a 4050-meter-high mountain in Hawaii, but petitions of protest were put up by local people in Hawaii's local courts
 in logon kaa kahana tha ki telescope ke nirmaan ne ek ‘pavitra sthal’ kaa ulanghan kiya he
 In 2015, a court order halted the creation of telescopes in Hawaii, contrary to the wishes of the global scientific community
 iske kaaran baari anischitata paidaa ho gai
 Since then, a search for a better alternative location started and Hanle, located at an altitude of 4500 meters in the extreme cold region of the Himalayas in India, was seriously considered
 bharat sthit haanaley main, indian institute of estrophijics (iiapi), bengalooru dwaara sanchalit vishwa kaa sabase ooncha prakaashiya telescope pehle se maujuud he
 The principal scientist of the IIAP project, Professor Eswar Reddy said, Hanley is a good location, but a much higher place to put a giant telescope on account of obstructive winds

 Despite this, the Government of India had spread its arms to put the TMT project in India

 The new US President Donald Trump had promised that after winning, he would build a strong wall along the neighboring border with Mexico
 ab raashtrapati pad kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad is vaade ko puraa karne kaa sanket donald trump de rahe hai
 Along with Mexicans, the question is arising worldwide whether Trump's wall will have any effect on international trade? Will this wall once again reveal the old definition of relationship with the neighboring countries, due to which there has been an attempt to build the wall many times before in history
 aaie jaanate hai isse pehle duniya main kab or kyon border wal banane kii koshish hui he-china main di great waldonald trump ne mexico seemaa par banaai jane vaali border wal kii tulana china kidi great walase kii he
 Construction of this 13,000-mile wall built in China began in the third century and was built by Ming Dynasty from the 14th to the 17th century
 is wal ko banane kaa uddeshy china ko padosi mongolian akraman se bachaane ke liye tha
 But The Great Wall did not succeed in this purpose
 germany main berlin waldwitiya vishwa yuddh samaapt hone ke baad germany ko do bhaag main baant diya gaya
 East Germany with Communist influence and West Germany with democratic influence
 yuddh samaapt hone ke ek dashak baad east germany ne berlin main is wal kaa nirmaan kiya jisase west berlin se loktantric prabhaav ko east main aane se roka ja sake
 The 96-mile-long wall was demolished on 9 November 1989 when East and West Germany were once unified
 ireland kii pis walcatholic or protestant isaayiyon ko alag karti is wal kaa nirmaan 1969 main tab karaayaa gaya jab yah kshetra ek dashak se sampradayik dangon se pareshaan tha
 Even after the construction of this wall, riots continued for almost three decades
 concreet, steel or eent se bani isi wal par jagah-jagah katile taron kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha jisase logon ko aar-paar jane se roka ja sake
 In 2013, North Ireland proposed to dismantle the wall by 2023, but most people in the region still believe that riots can once again take a form of deterioration once the wall breaks down
 israel west bank walisrael ne gaja strip or west bank border ke zyaadaatar ilaake par concreet se bani wal kaa nirmaan karaayaa he
 The purpose of this wall is to stop the terrorist attack from Palestine
 haalanki antarrashtriya str par is wal kii ninda israel dwaara jameen kabja karne ke makasad se wal banane ke liye kii jaati he
 Construction of this wall started in 2002 and construction work is still going on
 philhal israel prastaavit 441 mile wal main 283 mile kaa nirmaan kara chukaa he
 Israel and Egypt's border wall Israel has built a 140-mile-long and 15-20 feet tall concrete pillar and barbed wire wall to secure its border with Egypt
 is wal ko banane kaa makasad misr ke raste israel main gaiyrkanoonee africa imigration or hathiyaaron kii smugling ko raakna tha
 Construction of the wall began in 2012 and as a result, while in 2011, around 17,000 illegal immigrants crossed the border, in 2013 only 43 illegal immigrants could cross the border

 The recent events have made many people wonder whether the honor of a respected profession of advocacy has started diminishing? Senior advocate Satyendra Nath Nigam says in this regard that there is no place in the profession of younger generation of lawyers for austerity, sacrifice, dedication and urge to learn
 pehle har vishay kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya jaataa tha or maamle kii tah tak pahunchakar adaalat ko insaaf tak pahunchane main madad karne kaa jajba hota tha, lekin ab yah kora pesha banakar rah gaya he
 The corporation says that twenty-twenty-five years ago, lawyers had a status in the society and seeing the glow of their black coat, the big princes used to salute them and respect their opinions, but now some will be left to advocate To enter the profession has meant earning money for most
 kanpur baar association ke mahaamantri naresh treepathi ne bataaya ki shahar kii jila kachhari main kareeb 10 hajaar se adhik vakil association main registedr he jabaki teen se chaar hajaar ke bich vakil aise he jinka registration hona abhi baaki he
 He says that sometimes in the eyes of the media, sometimes for some other reason, some lawyers choose the path of uproar, but because of them, the entire community has to be discredited and everyone has to suffer the loss of uproar and sabotage
 treepathi kehete hai ki baar association kaa mahaamantri hone ke naate vah pichley saptaah police or vakeelon ke bich hue jhagade ko sulajhane main lage the or police kii lathi kaa shikaar hokar ghayal ho gaye
 He alleges that the police need an excuse to run lathis and the lawyers have made up their mind to fight the police against this attitude
 treepathi kaa kahana he ki jab tak kanpur ke jila jaj or lathicharge main shaamil police adhikariyon ko hataaya nahi jaataa, vakil apana andolan or anishchit kaaleen hadtaal jari rakhenge
 Regarding the common litigants and the accused accused in petty crimes due to the strike of lawyers, he said that our fight is against the policies of the government and administration
 isamen aam aadmi ko thodi bahut pareshaani to jhelni hi padegi
 He claimed that despite this problem, the common man is with the lawyers and he is also opposing the lathi charge on the lawyers
 unhone bataaya ki 2007 main bhi police adhikariyon ne aise hi vakilo par jabardast lathicharge kiya tha
 During this time vehicles of hundreds of lawyers were burnt
 ek anya varisht vakil ne naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha ki vakeelon kaa ek chota sa samooh he, jo aae din kachhari main hangaamaa karata he
 In the heat of the black coat, these young lawyers also forget the dignity of their profession
 vah kehete hai ki agar vakaalat ke peshey kaa bhavishya yahi he to aane vaale kal main na to koi vakeelon ko sammaan kii najar se dekhegaa or na hi unke kaale kot kii koi izzat hogi
 On Tuesday, the lawyers' strike continued for the sixth consecutive day in Kanpur
 unki maang he ki jila jaj or lathicharge ke doshi pulicekarmiyon ko hataaya jaae, tabhi vah apni hadtaal waapas lenge
 On Tuesday too, hundreds of clients came to the court to hear their cases and returned unscathed

 australia ke purv captain ian chapel khush he ki steve smith or david warner ek saal ke pratibandh ke kaaran bharat ke khilaaf gharelu siries main nahin khel paaenge kyonki agar vah maidan par utarate to darshak unka virodh karte
 Cricket Australia banned former captain Smith and vice-captain David Warner for a year after being found guilty of ball tampering in the Test series against South Africa on charges of ball tampering
 bhartiya team november ke aakhir main australia kaa daura karegi jahaan use chaar test maichon kii siries ke alaava limited overon ke maichon main bhi khelnaa he
 Chappan, known for his stern remarks, said at an event, 'cricket Australia did it right
 ek tarah se unhone smith or warner kaa saath diya he
 Because, if you think that Smith and Warner would have fielded against India, some spectators would have opposed them, probably in all the grounds
 ’viraat kohli bole- maidan ke andar sachin hi mere herochapal ne kaha ki unke desh main ‘chit (dhokheybaaj)’ kaha janaa sabase bura mana jaataa he
 Know someone in Australia as a cheater - it is considered the worst
 isliye maidan main unka virodh hota, jisase unka aatmavishvaas dagamagaataa or yah khel kii chhavi ke liye bhi sahi nahi hota
 Chappell said that in the absence of Smith and Warner, India will have a chance to win the Test series against Australia for the first time in 70 years of history
 unhone kaha, ‘main test siries ( australia main ) main bharat kii jeet kii bhavishyavaanee karuunga
 i do not know whether the Indian team will win comfortably or not
 vastav main bharat ke paas australia main test siries main jeet darj karne kaa yah sarvshereshth mauka hoga
 Defeating Australia will still not be easy as their bowling is strong

 On November 14, 2017, the Supreme Court Kamini Jaiswal vs Government of India case witnessed an unprecedented uproar in the Chief Justice's court
 adaalat main is kism kii avyavashtha shaayad pehali baar dekhi gai
 The issue was delicate as it was related to a former judge who was being accused of corruption for helping a banned medical college to get orders from the Supreme Court in his favor
 aarope lagaaya gaya ki purv jaj ne anukool adalati aadesh ke liye 3 karod rupye kii maang kii thi
 On Jaiswal's plea, Prashant Bhushan and Dushyant Dave put the matter before different benches on different dates, which could technically be untenable, as the FIR did not mention the name of a Supreme Court judge
 magar sawaal yah tha ki kya yah ek sanstha ke taur par supreme court kii satyanishtha bhang karne ke baraabar tha? hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki supreme court yaa hycourt ke kisi bhi jaj ke khilaaf exiar sambandhit mukhya nyaayadhish kii ijaajat ke bagaiyr darj nahin kii ja sakati
 Technically, there was no conflict of interest between the administrative side of the Chief Justice to hand over the case to a special bench
 lihaaja maamle se hatane ke aagrah ko uchit hi naamanzoor kar diya gaya
 But we have to remember that a judge must always be above suspicion
 is bich, usee exiar ke aadhaar par pravartan nideshaalay ne mani londring kaa maamla darj kiya he
 The controversy stressed the need for an institutional mechanism to deal with complaints against judges
 nyaayik javabdehi nyaaypalika kii aazaadee kii purv shart he
 The judiciary saw the unprecedented stalemate in the Supreme Court and all the High Courts regarding the judges' continuation
 yah samasya kuch had tak us peeth ne hi paidaa kii thi jisane rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) ko radd kar diya tha, par duusari taraf yah bhi nirdesh diya tha ki kanoon or nyaay mantralay supreme court collegium ke saath mashvira karke nayaa memorandam of proscisger (emopi) taiyaar kare
 The cancellation of a law passed by parliament unanimously was unprecedented in itself, but the re-framing of the MOP became a matter of much controversy, which was not even imagined
 nyaaypalika pehle hi lambit mukademon ke jabardast boj se dabi he, tis par supreme court se lekar adhinsth adaalaton tak tamaam staron par jajon ke 40-50 fisadi khaali padon ne ise or bhi mushkil or pechida bana diya he
 It is expected that the government will understand that justice cannot be compromised by keeping a large number of sanctioned posts vacant, especially when there is a demand to double the sanctioned posts of judges
 nyaaypalika ke upar pehle hi 3
 There is a burden of 3 crore lawsuits
 maujuuda gatirodh ke chalate mukademe or bhi bahut zyada vakt tak latake rahenge or teji se insaaf kii sambhaavna kahin zyada chhalaava ban jaaegi
 If justice is to play its role, then it will have to be caught by scrutiny, because any decision given after a decade or more, loses the merits of justice
 deree khud-ba-khud insaaf ko ninsaphi main badal sakane main samarth he
 The Supreme Court and other high courts are spending more and more time in public interest petitions (pils), which can only be at the cost of further delay in handling of cases pending for years
 kabhi-kabhi to maamle ke nibatare ke intjaar main abhaage abhiyukt sajaa kii puri miyaad hi jail main bitaa chuke hote hai, tab jaakar unke begunaah yaa doshi hone kaa faisla aata he
 The Supreme Court has said on several occasions that many pils have been found to be abusing the legal process
 isse adaalat kaa samay barbaad hota he jo ki aparaadh jaisaa he, kyonki mukademon kii sunwaayee aage kai or saalon tak latak jaati he
 It is expected that the constitutional courts will once again consider and give the highest priority in awarding cases
 mukademon ke nibatare ke baad bache vakt main hi janhit yachikaayen leni chahie
 In August 2017, the Supreme Court declared the practice of triple talaq as un-islamic and unconstitutional in the case of Shaira Bano v
 Government of India and others
 bahumat ke faisle main adaalat ne kaha ki chunki teen talaak usee pal lagu ho jaataa he or palata bhi nahin ja saktaa, isliye isamen shuhar or bivi ke bich unke pariwaron ke do madhyasthon ke jariye sulah kii koshish kii gunjaaish bhi nahin he
 The court said that in the way the triple talaq is prevalent, even if it is not given due to any valid reason, it is still considered valid
 lihaaja yah manamaana he, kyonki koi muslim mard nikaah ke bandhan ko sulah kii koshish ke bagaiyr manamaani se nahin tod saktaa
 Thus, triple talaq is unconstitutional and violates the right to equality granted under Article 14 of the Constitution
 sarkaar ne aage badhkar, kisi shaks ke apni bivi ko bole yaa likhe gaye lakrajon yaa electronic shakl main teen talaak dene ko shunya or gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar dene ke liye muslim mahila (vivaah ke adhikaron kaa sangrakshan) vidheyak 2017 ko sheetakaaleen satr main loksabhaa main pesh kar diya
 Even the government added a provision of punishment in sub-rule 4 of the Bill, which makes the declaration of divorce punishable with imprisonment of three years and fine
 is tarah yah kaid ko anivaary bana detaa he
 Subsection 5 speaks of alimony, without explaining how the woman will be administered to the woman when she goes to jail
 upanium 6 naaballigon kii castady kaa haq detaa he, par iske koi disha-nirdesh tay nahin kiye gaye hai or ise kisi bhi tareeke se tay karne ke liye magistrate ke vivek par chhod diya gaya he
 The government also failed to heed the Supreme Court ruling on July 27, 2017, in Rajesh Sharma v
 Uttar Pradesh government, which was told that dowry incidents are going on rampant despite the introduction of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
 
 supreme court ne kaha ki kai maamalon main giraftaar ke praavdhaan ke chalate pati ke parivaar ke un sadasyon ko julm sahane padate hai, jinhen mukademe main jhuthe fansaa diya jaataa he
 The court also noted that in 2005, 6,141 cases registered under Section 498A (cruelty to women) of the Indian Penal Code were declared false
 2009 main aise jhuthe maamalon kii taadaad 8,352 thi
 In 2012, the number of people acquitted in such cases was reported to be 3,17,000
 is faisle main supreme court ne jila vidhik seva praadhikaranon ko nirdesh diya ki ve parivaar kalyaan samitiyon kaa gathan karen
 a three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India is scheduled to hear the case in January 2018
 iske baavjood sarkaar ne ek aadha-adhuraa kanoon loksabhaa main pesh kar diya or use jas kaa tas paarit bhi kar diya gaya
 Luckily the government could not muster the necessary support in the Rajya Sabha, where it is currently hanging
 is saal 2018 main supreme court aadhaar ko mobile phone or bank khaaton se jodgaye kii ijaajat dene yaa nahin dene ke sawaal par vichaar karegaa
 The government claims that the security of Aadhaar data is infallible, while on 4 January, The Tribune newspaper published a major dent in the security of this data
 khabar ke mutabik, yuidi ke atirikt mahanideshak ne aadhaar data main ghuspaith kii baat sweekaar kii thi
 In the last week of November 2017, UIDAI claimed that Aadhaar data was completely safe and no data was leaked

 In Chandigarh, UIDAI officials expressed surprise at having access to complete data in a matter of 20 minutes

 This has created a deep concern among citizens about the money held in banks and the privacy of mobile conversations
 ek or mudda jisase nikat bhavishya main supreme court kaa saamana ho saktaa he, vah yah he ki kya auraten bhi vyabhichaar yaa parpurushgaman ke jurm kii doshi ho sakati hai
 For the last 158 years, Section 497 of the IPC considers a man as an adulteress and a married woman as a victim, unless the woman's husband has approved an extramarital sexual relationship between the wife and another man
 vyabhichaar ko pashchim main gaiyr-aparaadh ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 Sexual intercourse between two adults is now considered a private matter, and governments tend to focus on genuine crimes while avoiding moral guard
 jaahir he, supreme court is maamle par gaharaai se vichaar karegaa or phir tay karegaa ki vyabhichaar ko gaiyr-aparaadh banaaya jaae, yaa agar ise aparaadh banaae rakhaa jaataa he, to aurat bhi baraabar se doshi hogi yaa nahin

 The Indian team performed brilliantly in the first match, but then showed a disappointing game in the second match
 ek match main shandaar to agle hi match main lachar pradarshan, bhartiya purush hockey team kii pichley kuch varshon main yahi kahani rahi he
 India played a 1–1 draw from Australia in the opening match, but due to this intermittence, they had to face a place down 3–3 defeat to the 7th-ranked England team
 ek drow or ek haar se bhartiya team is samay pool bi main ek ank ke saath antim sthaan par he, jisamen germany kii team ek jeet or ek drow se chaar ank lekar sheersh par bani hui he
 Although pool matches are only to determine who will play in the quarter-finals, the Indian team is desperate to prove its critics wrong

 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad ab maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 After the announcement of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' development journey, now Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray is preparing to take out Jan Ashirwad Yatra
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle pradesh main siyaasi maahaul ko shivasena ke paksh main banane ke liye aditya thakare kii rath yatra kii rup rekha raajnneetik ranneetikaar prashanth kishor (pike) bana rahe hai
 The Chief Minister of Maharashtra should be from Shiv Sena, as Aditya Thackeray is embarking on a state visit amid claims
 yuva sena netaaon ne aditya thakare kii rath yatra kaa prachaar prasar shuru kar diya he
 For this, posters have been put in Marathi
 isamen saaf taur par likhaa he, 'jinhone vot diya unka aabhaar jataane ke liye or jinhone nahin diya, unka dil jeetne ke liye jald jan aashirwad yatra aditya thakare karne ja rahe hai
 'at the same time, before this, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has announced to go on a Vikas Yatra in Maharashtra
 'phir ek baar shivashahee sarkaar' or 'abaki baar 220 ke paar' jaise naaron kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 For the first time in the history of Maharashtra, when a leader will travel across the state through a rath yatra while being the Chief Minister
 is yatra ke jariye fadanvis pradesh ke siyaasi mizaaj ko samajhane ke saath-saath apane vikaas kaaryon ko logon ke bich pahunchaayenge
 The yatra will begin in August and continue till the assembly elections
 fadanvis ke nakshekadam par chalate hue aditya thakare bhi apni yatra shuru kar rahe hai, mana ja rahaa he ki jisaki rup rekha prashanth kishor bana rahe hai
 On the lines of Jagan Mohan Reddy, Aditya Thackeray's travel plan has been prepared before the election
 andhra pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle prashanth kishor ke maargdarshan main jagan mohan reddy ne hajaaron kilometre kii janayatra kii thi
 Reddy got a tremendous advantage of this journey, similarly now Shiv Sena wants to launch its young face
 maharashtra main shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan ke bich seat shering par sahmati ban chuki he, lekin mukhyamantri pad ko lekar abhi kuch tay nahin he
 There is a tussle between the Shiv Sena and the BJP, so both are vying to win more seats than each other in the assembly elections
 isiilie donon partiyaan apni siyaasi jameen ko dobaaraa se majboot karnaa chaah rahi hai
 Shiv Sena has started projecting Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray as the chief ministerial candidate
 mukhyamantri pad ko lekar shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main sampadakeey bhi likhi ja chuki he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena se hoga
 Apart from this, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has clearly said that there is no such thing as Deputy in Shiv Sena

 rahane ne srilanka ke khilaaf kheli ja rahi test siries ke dauraan abhi tak ballebaaji ke dauraan maatr (17,4,0,2) ran banaae hai
 In such a situation, if Rahane does not get runs with the bat during the last Test match in Delhi starting on December 2, then his selection in the Test team for the tour of South Africa can be quite tough

 Bahubali leader and Independent MLA Anant Singh, who fled for fear of police arrest, released a video on Sunday night
 isamen unhone kaha ki wo agle 3 se 4 din main court ke saamne sarender karenge
 Anant Singh said that he has not run away from fear of arrest, but has gone to some place to see his ailing friend
 darasal, shanivaar raat patna police kii team bahubali vidhayak anant singh ko giraftaar karne ke liye unke patna awaas par pahunchi thi, lekin isaki bhanak anant singh ko lag gai thi or wo vahaan se faraar ho gaye the
 Earlier on Friday, Patna police raided his house in Ladma's ancestral village Ladma, from where an AK-47, 22 live cartridges and two bombs were recovered
 anant singh ke paitruk awaas se eke-47 kii baramadagi ke baad police ne analophul activities (privansion) act ke tahat exiaar darj kiya tha or unhen giraftaar karne ke liye shanivaar raat unke patna sthit awaas par pahunchi thi
 In the video, Anant Singh described the recovery of AK-47 from his house as a conspiracy by the police
 unhone apana bachaav karte hue kaha ki wo pichley 14 varshon se apane paitruk awaas par nahin gaye hai or aise main vahaan par eke-47 ko chupa ke rakhane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 Anant Singh alleged that Additional SP Lipi Singh had an AK-47 placed at his house to trap him
 video main anant singh ne kaha ki unhone mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se mulaakaat ke liye vakt bhi maanga tha, taaki wo apana paksh rakh saken, magar unhen vakt nahin mila
 Anant Singh said that he has full faith in the court
 antariksh yatra pehle ke mukaable sasti hoti ja rahi he, or ab to privet america companiyon ke paas kru modul maujuud hai, jinke zariye ve insaanon ko antariksh main saiyr ke liye le jane kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 But there is a question related to this development, which is constantly troubling the experts that when today or not tomorrow, the human settlement in space is to become a reality, then in that 'enemy' environment with lots of radiation without gravity How will a person be able to have sex? ab bharat bhi 'gaganyan' ke saath maanav ko antariksh main bhejne kii taiyaari main laga hua he, or america privet rocketon ke zariye antarikshayatriyon ko bhejne ja rahaa he, kyonki insaan ab antariksh main maujuud grahon (upgrahon) par basane kaa vichaar bana rahaa he, to maanav jivan ko banaae rakhane se jude sawaalon ke jawaab talash karnaa bhi zaruri ho chalaa he
 On this controversial question, we talked to General Charles Bolden, who has been associated with four space missions, and has been the head of NASA for eight years
 is samay general charles bolden bharat-america antariksh sahyog kaa prachaar-prasar karne ke liye bharat aae hue hai
 ndtv's science editor Pallava Bagla tried to answer the same questions from former NASA chief, veteran astronaut and currently US space affairs science envoy, about how humans would be able to have sex in space without gravity, or How will the child be born
 jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, mujhe nahin lagata, is mudde par kuch zyaada research kii gai he ki yah kaise hoga, kyonki yah bilkul vaisaa hi he, jaise antariksh main bathroom janaa
 
 
 We do not invent anything new, the fact is that the crew lives in micro-gravity, and that is why it is most important to keep them stable
 
 
 ham toilet kii said par chote-chote handle laga dete hai, unhen ghumaao, bas
 
 
 They are spring-loaded, and stick to your thigh
 
 
 aap isi tarah kaa kuch kar sakate hai, jo aap vahaan karte hai
 
 
 When you go to the bathroom, we produce suction with the help of a fan system, which is like a very small vacuum cleaner
 
 
 ham un halaat main dhal jate hai, jinamein ham rahete hai
 
 
 Whatever we are able to do on Earth, it is a matter of stopping or making it difficult to do in space that there is no gravity there
 
 
 lekin jab bhi kuch karne kaa vakt aata he, log koi na koi rasta nikaal hi liya karte hai
 
 
 There have been frequent rumors that astronauts have had sex at the International Space Station (ISS), but officially NASA has always denied it
 ISS darasal arabon dollar ke kharch se banaai gai aisi prayogshaala he, jo lagaataar dharti kii parikrama karti rahati he, auki jisamen har samay maanav maujuud rahe hai
 The ISS has been circling the Earth's lower orbit for the past 18 years
 airspes phizician tathaa NASA ke antariksh yatri dow maaikel aar
 Barrett says that most of the astronauts chosen today are mature people who know how to stay calm in difficult situations
 barat yah bhi kehete hai ki gurutvkarshan-rahit antariksh main garbh dhaaran karnaa or garbhavastha haragiz nahin honi chahie, kyonki ab tak ham jeevigyaan ko puri tarah nahin samajhate hai
 But according to Barrett, the biggest challenge is "to be exposed to high radiation irresistibly when someone is out of the earth's defenses
" 
 
 " darasal, prithvi hamen jivan ko sahaara dene vaala adarsh 'goldilox vaataavaran' uplabdh karaati he
 Apart from these questions, General Charles Bolden believes that India's dream of sending an Indian young man or woman from Sriharikota into space is very likely to be fulfilled
 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ke adhyaksh dow ke
 Sivan said about the 'gaganyaan Mission' that 'india does not want to be left behind when planets and satellites exist in space in the near future
 
 
 ' ummid he ki ISRO ab maanav jeev vigyaan par bhi doguni gati se kaam kar rahaa hoga, kyonki bhale hi ve shandaar rocket or upgrah banaate hai, lekin maanav jeevigyaan ke kshetra main ve utane majboot ab tak nahin rahe hai
 The man who makes satellites and spacecraft, India, will use them to settle in space, but how he will be able to have children after reaching space is still an unanswered question

 congress pichley dedh dashak se satta se baahar he or satta kii vaapasi ke liye aatur najar aa rahi he
 Despite this, a major crisis with the Congress is factionalism in the party, which is its biggest obstacle in the return of power
 MP congress main shah-maat kaa kheldansal madhya pradesh congress main digvijay singh, kamalnath,jyotiraditya sindhiya, ajay singh, satyavrath chaturvedi or suresh pachori jaise bade netaa he
 But there is a game of cheating between all these veteran leaders of Congress
 ab rajya main congress kii ore se CM pad kaa cheharaa banane kii kavayad tej ho gai he
 Who is the face of CM against Shivraj? The BJP has been in power for the last 14 years and Shivraj Singh Chauhan is the Chief Minister for 12 years
 pichley kuch dinon shivaraj singh ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar uth rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress is expecting to return to power
 isiilie congress ke netaa rajya main party kaa cheharaa banane ke liye haath pair maarane lage he
 Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath has stood up in favor of Jyotiraditya Scindia, MP from Kamal Nath Gwalior, who is making Scindia the CM face

 " sandhya va menon ne menu pehle se hi tay kar liya tha or sandhya kii team ne ain maukey par kisi dikkat se bachane ke liye shoot se pehle hi vyanjanon ko banaakar chakh liya tha
 Kumar also made sure that everything looks very luxurious and gorgeous without any artificial colors or preservatives
 sandhya kahati hai ki shef film main vyanjanon ko keval dikhaane bhar ke liye nahin rakhaa gaya he, yah ek mukhya kirdaar bhi he
 The film underscores how important food plays in Indian culture
 ''hamaara aatithy isi baat par nirbhar karata rahaa he ki ham mehmaanon ko kya khilaate-pilaate hai—hamaare yahaan to maut ke maukey par bhi bhoj hota he
 "now will these dishes be as mouth-watering as the street food seen in Angamaly Diaries? It is not known but Sandhya is sure that this film will make the audience to try the on-screen Indian cuisine

 input: bhashaa India has been on a number of attempts to ban the UN on the terrorist organization Jaish and its chief Masood Azhar, the mastermind behind the terror attack in Pathankot, Uri, Nagrota

 Azhar's assets will be confiscated if the UN is banned and his travel will be banned
 India has said that the proposal has received tremendous support from all the members of the banning committee except China

 - samarohon ko lekar punjab main congress sarkaar or akali dal ke bich kuch matbhed dikhaai detaa he
 Are you unhappy with the views of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the Akali Dal and the apex body of the Gurdwaras on this issue? Yes, think so
 aap to jaanate hi hai ki guru nanak ji jaisi kisi shakhsiyat se judaa koi utsav hota he, to uskaa aayojan sarkaar hi karti ai he
 For example, the same was done during Guru Gobind Singh Ji's ceremony
 rajya sarkaar ne sari vyavastha kii
 There was no issue
 mujhe nahin pataa, is samay ve kyon samasya paidaa kar rahe hai? guru sahab kaa sandesh ekta or saamanjasy kaa tha
 i have been telling them from day one that at least on this occasion, the unity of the Sikh fraternity and the wider interest of the country should be shown
 - kartarpur galiyare kii kya ahmiyat he or kya yah shanti kaa galiyara banegaa?main ise do tarah se dekhtaa hum
 Firstly as a Sikh
 or mujhe behad khushi he ki yah kaam kiya gaya
 The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was devastated by floods in the 1920s, when my grandfather [maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala] rebuilt it
 aise main mere liye to yah itihaas se guzarate hue kii jane vaali tirth yatra he
 This is why every Sikh is happy today
 lekin pakistan kii manshaa ko lekar mere andeshe bhi hai
 It has been 70 years
 ab tak unhone kartarpur galiyare ko jodgaye ke bare main kyon nahin sochaa? unhone pehle baba guru nanak vishvavidhyalay ke nirmaan ke bare main kyon nahin sochaa? mujhe lagata he ki yah iesai kaa ek oparation he
 You remember, Navjot Singh Sidhu was called for the swearing-in ceremony of Imran Khan as the Prime Minister of Pakistan and even before the swearing-in, General Bajwa [pakistani Army Chief] informed Sidhu that he would be happy to know
 That they are opening the corridor
 yani sena ne pehle se hi iske liye jameen taiyaar kar lee thi or ve jab bhi aisa kuch karte hai, to mere kaan khadey ho jate hai
 - Indian intelligence agencies report that a militant camp is being established or has been established near Kartarpur and this has been done by ISI
 ab mujhe vahaan ke shiviron ke bare main to jaankaree nahin he
 Intelligence agencies will know more about this
 lekin nishchit rup se, pichley ek-do varshon main, jab se main pad par hum, hamane ghuspaith kii bahut-si ghatnaayen dekhi hai
 My government busted about 26 modules when they were trying to enter Punjab
 hamane 120 se adhik logon ko jail main daalaa he
 Around 400 weapons and various types of explosives have come here
 ye log yahaan diwaali manaane ke liye to aa nahin rahe hai; jaahir he, ve kisi sajeesh ke tahat aa rahe hai or bataur mukhyamantri mujhe isi par najar rakhni he
 - Are you apprehensive about Sikh extremism returning to Punjab? darasal iesai ne avatar singh pannu or kuch anya kii aguai main ek alag khalistaan kii maang ko samarthan dene ke liye sikh for justise program (sikhon ke saath nyaay kaarykram) launch kiya he
 They want to sympathize with these things in Punjab so that their mission [a Sikh referendum by 2020] can be successful
 duusare, ve apane opareshnon ke liye punjab main adhik cell banane main sakasham hona chaahate hai
 These are the things that we have to see
 jaisaa ki maine kaha, ek sikh ke rup main main khush hum ki main kartarpur ja rahaa hum, lekin ek mukhyamantri ke rup main mujhe is baat ko lekar sajag or chaukanna rahanaa hoga ki aakhir iske peeche or kya iraadaa ho saktaa he?- kartarpur galiyare ke sandarbh main or punjab main aatankwaadiyon kii khuli awajahi na ho sake, iske liye aapane bharat sarkaar ko kis tarah kii saavdhaaniyaan baratane kii salaah di he?mujhe nahin lagata ki ve galiyare main march karne utrenge
 They are conditionally trying to create an atmosphere to support their nefarious activities in Punjab
 - paryaavaran ke liye guru nanak devji kii chintaa jagajaahir he
 But one of the biggest issues today is the increasing pollution in Delhi due to burning stubble in Punjab at present
 or aapaki sarkaar par aarope lagaae ja rahe hai ki aapane ise niyantrit karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 See, in the last two years, we have filed charges against many farmers and punished them
 hycourt ne unhen chhod diya
 We have about 39 Kisan Trade Unions, who go to the farmers and tell them that the last action was taken but they got a concession, so you need not panic, keep doing as you wish
 beshak, hamane kisaanon ko phir se dandit kiya he or zyada se zyada maamle darj kiye hai, lekin dukh kii baat he ki yah sab guru nanak dev ji kii 550veen jayanti par ho rahaa he, jinhone kaha tha ki ''pawan guru, paani pita, mata dharti mahat ( hawa hamaari guru he, pani hamaara pita or dharti hamaari mata)
 "now his words are being ignored by the same community that he gave birth to and i don't think that's okay
" -paraali ko ukhaadie kii takanic jab uplabdh he to punjab sarkaar use kyon nahin apana rahi taaki use kheton main jalaane kii jarurat hi na ho?hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki yahaan ke 70 fisad kisaanon ke paas paanch acre se kam jameen he or unamem se aadhe ke paas do acre se bhi kam
 These are people who cannot afford the use of tractors
 isiilie maine pradhanmantri ji se anurodh kiya he ki yadi ve hamen (kharide gaye anaaj ke nunatam samarthan mulya se) 100 rupye prati quintal zyada den, to ham yah pakkaa kar sakate hai ki kisaan paraali ke nibatare ke liye tractaron kaa upyog karen
 If this is not done then the farmer will not be able to feed his family
 -captain! phir iskaa rasta kya he? aapako pataa he, puraa desh ise lekar chintit he
 i will say one thing, they keep blaming Punjab but if you look at the pollution figures, then the figures of Punjab have come down by 18% compared to last year and the fact is that Delhi is far worse in terms of pollution figures
 Is in to vah pradooshan kahaan se or kaise aa rahaa he? yah lakhon lakh nai kaaron se aa rahaa he jo sadakon par utari hai
 This is the pollution of the industrial development and construction that is going on
 mi
 (arvind) Kejriwal should stop it
 -kya aapako ummid he ki koi rasta nikalegaa?aisi ummid rakhni hi hogi kyonki sthiti kharaab he
 You know, i have written in my letter to the Prime Minister that it is not my responsibility as Chief Minister to stop pollution, but my children and grandchildren all live in Delhi, so i care about them too
 - ant main, chunki ham guru nanak dev ji kii 550veen jayanti par baat kar rahe hai, to main jaananaa chaahunga ki guru nanak dev ji vyaktigat rup se aapke jivan main kya sthaan rakhte hai or aap unase kitni prerana lete hai?dekhie, mere liye to ve is sristi ke rachayita or meri aasthaa ke udgamarot hai
 What they mean to me
 
 
 ise main shabdon main vyakt karne main bhi asamarth hum
 What to say about his greatness is beyond expression
 unka ek sandesh hamen yaad rakhana chahie: 'naa koi hindu, naa koi musalmaa, sab rab de bande'—bharat ko aaj isi kii aavashyaktaa he
 They (delhi) keep blaming Punjab, but if you look at the pollution figures, it has decreased by 18% over the last year
 or tathy yah he ki aankadon ke lihaaj se dilli kahin buree sthiti main he
 That pollution is coming from millions of new cars, industrial development and construction works
