 Shiv Sena has already told that the Chief Minister in Maharashtra will be made by Shiv Sena, but it is said that BJP is not ready on this matter
 donon partiyaan vidhansabha chunaav main zyada se zyada siten chaahati hai
 On the other hand, angry with Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray's comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Maharashtra BJP branch on Sunday said that its workers do not want any more talks on the seat sharing between the two alliance partners for the next month's assembly elections
 bijepi rajya shakha ke pravaktaa madhav bhandari ne mumbai main kaha, 'uddhav thakare kii tippaniyon kaa uddeshy pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nicha dikhaanaa tha
 His comments have been severely criticized by the Maharashtra BJP
 hamaare kaaryakarta donon dalon ke bich baatcheet rokane or apni khud kii raah talashne ke liye netritv par jor de rahe hai or dabaav daal rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that Uddhav had said in the Panchayat Aaj Tak program on Saturday that the Modi wave failed to make an impact in many states and that the bjp's victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections should be credited not only to Modi but also to his coalition partners
 ’uddhav ne kaha tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main logon ne badlaav ke ek chehre (modi) ke liye vot diya or maharashtra main mili jeet main shivasena ke yogadan ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, 'did Modi wave happen in Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Odisha and West Bengal? It also depends on coalition partners
 modi hamaare gathbandhan ke pradhanmantri hai
 Bhandari said that this is not the first time Uddhav has made 'derogatory' remarks on Modi
 unhone saath hi kaha ki jamini str ke kaaryakartaaon ke aadhaar par netritv antim faisla letaa he
 He said, “the workers want to see all the talks end and the leadership finally listens to their grassroots workers as they do all the work at the grassroots level

 ajtak ne hardik se puure halaat par sidhi baatcheet kii
 Hardik's response to his answer - Aaj Tak - With whom Hardik Patel? Hardik - We are with him who will talk about our rights
 bhaajapa ne to 20 saal main hamaare adhikaar ki baat nahin kii he
 Had a meeting with Congress and spoke positively
 yah sahi he ki congress vipaksh main he, to abhi se to lagu nahin kar degi
 But they are giving assurances, and giving it among the people, then we will stand with good people
 ham party jwine nahi karenge, prachaar nahi karenge, lekin achche logon ke saath rahenge
 Aaj Tak- Congress has not yet clarified its stand? Hardik- It said good thing
 agar wo galat hote to kah dete ki ham aapaki shart maanate hai, lekin unhone kanoonee taur par use lagu karne baat kii
 It is not a problem to wait 2-4 days in a two-year battle
 ajtak- congress ne aapaki chaar baaten maan lee hai
 Will Congress play it after winning the election? Hardik - Those people explained the small things very well
 agar nahin karnaa tha to ve bol dete ki aarakshan de denge
 Then he would not say, what can we do
 unhonechaar sharten manihain, jise ve acchhee tarah nibhaayenge
 The fifth issue will be decided in 2-4 days
 agar unhen lagegaa ki jis janata ne unhen 25 saal se satta main nahin bithaaya tha usee janata ne un par bharosa kar satta main bithaaya he, to wo bhi maanenge ki inkaa kaam karenge

 He speaks as a spokesperson, he is CM, he is not known
 meraa stand clear he, main janata ke saath hum
 Aaj Tak- Will you go to Rahul Gandhi's rally or meet somewhere? Hardik- It is clear that i am not going to share any stage

 Like Narendra Bhai, i do not know how to take decisions alone
 ajtak- patidaar 2002 ke dangon ke maamle main jail main bad hai?hardik- 145 patidaar aaj bhi dangon ke maamle main jail main band hai
 Even today many people get released on parole, so tell me that you should keep this issue, hearty brother
 lekin bhaajapa kin muddon par baat karti he, aatankwaad ke mudde par, hindutv ke mudde par baat karti he bhaajapa
 Be it BJP or RSS or VHP
 lekin ve jail main patidaaron ke liye 200 rupee kaa maniorder nahin karavaate, jamaanat ke liye kuch nahin karte
 Have taken contracts in the name of Hindutva
 ham bhi hindu hai, ham patel hai, ham par atyaachaar hua to kahaan gai thi bhaajapa
 RSS people persecute
 jab bhi dangon ki baat aati he to hindutv kii baat kar netagiri chamakaane lagate hai
 Aaj Tak - Who is angry with BJP or RSS? Hardik - We are most upset
 jo hamaare adhikaron kii baat nahin karata, ham usase khafa hai
 Most of the RSS people were Patidars
 lekin jab aarakshan kaa mudda aayaa to saare log pichhe hat gaye
 Aaj Tak- Are you with Congress? Hardik- It is clear that i am against BJP
 lekin kiske saath hum, yah maine saaf nahin kiya he
 For two and a half years i have been fighting for the cause of the people and will continue to fight
 ajtak- hardik congress kaa saath denge, lekin kya patidaar samaaj hardik kaa saath degaa?hardik- aapane 2015 ke panchayat ke chunaav dekh liye ki log kiske saath hai
 Now the OBC society has come with the Patidars, the ST society has come, the farmers have come, the traders have come, the youth are there, the women have come after the demonetisation
 ye sab naaraaz hai ki unke bachaae paise bhi chale gaye
 6 crore people, Hardik is not alone
 ajtak- log bijepi se naaraaz hai, lekin kya congress ko vot denge?hardik- log bijepi se naaraaz hai
 i say again and again that the people whom you did not sit in power for 25 years must have been a little smarter now
 ekbar chance dena chahie
 Change is the rule of nature
 agar wo acha karte hai to unhen bithaana chahie
 i can't say sit it, sit it
 ajtak- aapaki baat congress ke samarthan main hoti he?hardik- main congress ke samarthan main baat nahin karata
 But naturally, when there is opposition and there is talk against the ruling party, people feel that i am in support of the opposition
 meri baat jubaan se kadavi he
 Aaj Tak- What if Congress does not talk about reservation? 
 
 hardik- bhavishyavaanee kyun karte hai, jo hoga acha hoga

 It says that both Salim and Javed have always raised their voice against bigotry in Muslims
 javed ko fatve ke khilaaf tippanee karne or ise jari karne waalon ko murkh tathaa ‘unmaadi’ kehane ke liye dhamkiyaan mili hai
 But they are not the ones who get scared by these threats

 pathakon ko yaad dilaayaa gaya he ki vah (saleem) kuch samay pehle vande maataram kaa virodh kiye jane par muslim maulaviyon kii aalochana bhi kar chuke hai
 The editorial states that if Muslim women should not take education, they should not work, then what should they do? Only people like Salim and Javed can lead them in moving Muslims from darkness to light and jihad to patriotism

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter devon ke dev shivashankar bholenath apane bhakton ke man kii baat bahut jaldi sunate hai
 If you worship with the mind, then the Shivad becomes very happy
 isliye bhakton main sabase priy bhi hai
 Shivaratri is a great chance to please Lord Shankar and his entire family
 ye 10 chijen bhagwaan shiv ko hai behad priy
 
 
 While worshiping Shiv Shankar on Pandit Praveen Mishra's idol, it is important to keep some things in mind
 khaastaur se agar aap shivlinga kii puja kar rahe hai to kuch chizon ko bhuulakar bhi shivlinga par na chadhayen
 Know which are those things 
 
 1
 Do not offer water from Shank: Lord Shiva killed a demon named Shankhchud
 shankh ko usee asur kaa pratik mana jaataa he, jo bhagwaan vishnu kaa bhakt tha
 Therefore, the tolerant God is worshiped by the conch, not the shiva
 2
 Do not offer Tulsi Leaf: Lord Vishnu has accepted Tulsi as a wife
 isliye tulsi se shiv ji kii puja nahin hoti
 3
 til yaa til se bani koi vastu na chadhayen:yah bhagwaan vishnu ke mile se utpann hua maan jaataa he, isliye ise bhagwaan shiv ko nahin arpit kiya janaa chahie
 Bholenath is soon pleased with this praise
 
 
 4
 Never offer broken rice: There is a scripture written in the scriptures about the offering of whole rice to God Shiv
 tutaa hua chaaval apurna or ashuddh hota he, isliye yah shiv ji ko nahin chadhataa
 5
 shiv ko nahin bhaataa kumkum:kumkum saubhaahgya kaa pratik he, jabaki bhagwaan shiv vairaagi hai, isliye shiv ji ko kumkum nahin chadhataa
 6
 haldi or nariyal kaa pani:haldi kaa sambandh bhagwaan vishnu or saubhaahgya se he, isliye yah bhagwaan shiv ko nahin chadhataa he or nariyal ko maa lakshmi kaa pratik mana jaataa he, isliye shiv ji ko arpit nahin kii jaati

 ) Mahadangal is going on in Maharashtra
 congress-ensipi, bijepi-shivasena sabhi aise lard rahe hai maano ajanabi hon
 Whereas bjp-shiv Sena alliance has been together for 25 years and congress-ncp has been running the government for 15 years
 magar baat ban nahin rahi he
 bjp-shiv Sena feel that this time the power is to come, in such a situation, who will become the Chief Minister is the biggest question
 koun aisa mauka chhodana chahega
 The BJP is obviously very excited after the Lok Sabha elections and wants to take advantage of the Modi wave
 saath main kuch chote dal bhi hai jo bijepi or shivasena ke bich jhul rahe hai
 This is the first election of the Legislative Assembly when Bal Thackeray is not there
 raaj thakare kamjor pad gaye se dikh rahe hai
 His mlas are joining BJP and are sitting ready
 aankadon ke hisaab se loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke anusaar bijepi 131 siton par aage he jabaki shivasena 100 siton par
 Obviously BJP does not want to back down from 130 seats
 vahiin, uddhav thakare pehle hi kah chuke hai mishan 150 yani itani siten jeetne kaa lakshya
 In such a situation, the screw of the alliance is stuck
 saath hi shivasena pehle se maanati he ki loksabhaa main adhik siten bijepi lade or vidhansabha main shivasena
 Now the tension has increased so much that there is no negotiation on a large scale
 vahiin, bijepi ne chote dalon ko apane saath kar ke sena par dabaab banane kii koshish kii he jaise raju shetty kii swabhimani shetakari sanghathan loksabhaa ke aankadon ke hisaab se nau siton par aage he
 He obviously wants at least 10 seats, while the Shiv Sena is adamant
 usase lagata he ki 15 saalon ke baad maharashtra ke mukhyamantri kii kursi unase khisak rahi he
 At the same time, the situation is not good for Congress and NCP either
 ensipi baat nahin karke samay le rahi he
 She may also be waiting that if the Shiv sena-bjp alliance breaks down, there may be a chance to form a new alliance
 jaankaar maanate hai ki ajit pavaar kii ranneeti sharad pavaar se alag he
 While Sharad Pawar may not say no to Sonia Gandhi, Ajit Pawar does not have the same sentiment for Sonia Gandhi as Sharad Pawar
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki sonia gandhi ne ek vakt main sharad pavaar ko loksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaa banaaya tha
 For Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra politics matters more than Delhi and they know that Sharad Pawar has more or less played his innings in Delhi politics and Delhi is now referred to Supriya Sule
 aise main ajit pavaar ke maharashtra ke mukhyamantri banane ke sapane kaa kya hoga
 This is the reason why NCP gave two-and-a-half-year formula to the Chief Minister, which upset the Congress
 yadi 2014 ke loksabhaa ke aakadon ko dekhen to congress keval 16 vidhansabha siton par aage he or uske paas keval do saansad hai
 While NCP is ahead in 25 assembly seats and has four mps
 aise main baraabar siton yani 144 par donon ke ladane kaa ensipi kaa daawa majboot he
 But according to the situation that is now happening, the Congress is ready to fight in all the seats
 congress ko lagata he ki maharashtra main ensipi kii haalat kharaab he kyanki sabhi mahatvapurn mantralay jaise grih, vitt, peedbludi sabhi ensipi ke paas hai or unke mantriyon ke khilaaf gussa adhik ho saktaa he
 Congress strategists also believe that whichever seats come, this is a good opportunity to apply for all seats
 kahin na kahin congress ko lagata he ki 15 saal lagaataar sarkaar chalaane ke baad janata shaayad hi is baar is gathbandhan ko mauka de or thik yahi soch kar ensipi chaahati he ki yadi bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan tuutata he to ek nayaa gathbandhan banaakar janata ko kuch nayaa pesh kiya jaae
 The question is the same, everyone's dream is to become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 kursi ek he or daavedaaron main uddhav thakare, nitin gadakari, ajit pavaar or prithviraj chouhan sabhi hai
 The assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was the biggest mistake of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)

 Balasingham has admitted that the killing of Rajiv Gandhi was the biggest mistake of the LTTE
 ' The LTTE never officially accepted that it killed Rajiv Gandhi
 ullekhneey he ki chennai main fidaayin mahila hamalavar ne unki hatya kar di thi
 Personally, Balasingham told Norway that the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a complete disaster
 solhem ke mutabik, 1987-90 ke dauraan srilanka main tainaat bhartiya sainikon dwaara tamilon kii hatya kaa prabhakaran badla lenaa chahta tha, jiske liye balasingham ne rajeev gandhi kii hatya kaa faisla kiya
 It is believed that if Rajiv Gandhi once again came to power, he would have sent the army to Sri Lanka again
 solhem ne yah bhi kaha ki balasingham kaa disambar 2006 main cancer se nidhan ho gaya, lekin vah america va europe se baahar nikalnaa chaahate the, kyonki unka vaastavik sneh bharat ke saath tha
 According to the book, 'in the last days of his life in 2006, Balasingham also tried to apologize to India for his mistake (rajiv's murder)
 ' After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the LTTE was banned and Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman were declared criminals
 duusari taraf, balasingham ko is baat ko sweekaar karne main koi gurej nahin tha ki littey ne tamil netaa va shikshavid neelam tiruchelvam kii july 1999 main ek sadak par hatya kar di
 Solheim said that when Balasingham came face to face in Norway on Rajiv's assassination, he said, "yes, we killed him and if you listen to me, i will tell you why we did it
" ' kitaab main solhem ne balasingham ke hawaale se kaha ki unhone prabhakaran ko ek sipahasaalar qaraar diya tha or kaha ki littey ko khud ko ek raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main badal dena chahie
 The comments balasingham ne solhem se kaha, 'aapako in logon (littey) kii takat ko kabhi kamatar nahin aankna chahie

 It is noteworthy that she was killed by a female suicide bomber in Chennai
 nijee taur par, balasingham ne norge se kaha ki rajeev gandhi kii hatya puri tarah se ek aapadaa thi
 According to Solheim, Prabhakaran wanted to take revenge for the killing of Tamils by Indian soldiers stationed in Sri Lanka during 1987–90, for which Balasingham decided to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi
 mana gaya ki agar rajeev gandhi ek baar phir satta main aate, to vah phir srilanka main sena bhej dete
 Solheim also said that Balasingham died of cancer in December 2006, but wanted to move out of the US and Europe, as his genuine affection was with India
 kitaab ke mutabik, 'saal 2006 main jivan ke antim dinon main balasingham ne apni galati (rajeev kii hatya) ke liye bharat jaakar maafee maangane kaa prayaas bhi kiya tha

 zyaadaatar log apane rishte badal lete hai
 No, these 8 problems of a relationship can be solved! luk fank ne bataaya ki vajan ghataane ke baad log maansik taur par kaaphi majboot ho jate hai or pehle se bahut behatar mahasoos karne lag jate hai

 Luke Funk explained the reason for this, saying that after getting the desired changes in the body, people might feel like experiencing a new kind of relationship
 isliye log partner badal lete hai
 However, researchers say that this research is not necessarily relevant to people from countries other than Sweden

 '' Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is celebrating his 75th birthday today
 mulaayam singh khud ko mahaan swatantraaa senaanee or prakhar samaajawaadee raamamanohar lohia kaa shishy bataate hai
 Mulayam, the head of the party named after Lohia, is politically the 'super Chief' of the country's most important state
 mulaayam singh raajnneeti main lagbhag paanch dashakon se sakriy hai
 Rammanohar Lohia's disciple who gave the slogan of Saptakranti knows Mulayam Singh and his guru from these seven things
 
 
 1
 Ram Manohar Lohia was a great advocate of Swadeshi
 unhone angreji bhashaa kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki yah shaskaon kii bhashaa he, desh kaa vikaas apni bhashaa main hi ho saktaa he
 But his disciple Mulayam Singh's son Akhilesh Yadav went to Australia to study engineering
 hamaara andaja he vahaan koi hindi kaa gurukul to rahaa nahin hoga
 2
 lohia ne har str par barabari kii baat kii
 The only way to bring level of education level was to improve the condition of government schools and teach their children in all government schools
 vikipedia bataata he ki mulaayam singh parivaar sarkari skulon main bas yojanaon kaa feeta kaatane hi gaya he
 In their second and third generation, no child studied in primary government school
 3
 Lohia was in opposition, the basis of his politics was opposition from Congress
 desh main jab nehru or congress ke aage raajnneeti dikhaai nahin detii thi lohia ne akele dam vipaksh khadaa kiya or congress ko kai rajyon main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Mulayam has also played the dilemma of the Congress opposition, but on every important occasion he has saved the Congress government
 4
 Lohia considered economic equality as meaningless without any equal
 lohia ke jivan kaa andaja isi tathy se lagaaie ki nidhan ke baad unhone apane peeche koi sampatti nahin chodi vahiin duusari taraf mulaayam singh yadav par aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 5
 lohia ne jivan bhar aadmi or aurat ke bhedbhaav kaa virodh kiya
 Talking about the honor and equal interests of women, some statements of Mulayam against Lohia women when the country seemed to agree to punish the rape convicts, Lohia's disciple Mulayam made a controversial statement
 mulaayam ne balaatkaariyon kaa paksh lete hue kaha ladakon se galati ho hi jaati he iskaa matlab ye to nahin ki unako faansee par chadha diya jaae
 6
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri nehru par tanj kasate hue lohia ne kaha tha ki jab desh kaa bahusankhyak maatr 3 aane kamata he, nehru kaa ek din kaa kharch 25 hajaar he
 Lohia had the moral courage to surround even the Prime Minister on the extravagance of money
 apane janmdin par lakhon kharch hota dekh mulaayam ko lohia kii yaad aa rahi hogi kya!7
 Lohia gave the principle of roti and beti to break the cycle of casteism
 lohia ne kaha tha jatvaad kaa khaatmaa karne ke liye samaaj kii har jati ko ek duusare ke saath baith kar khaanaa chahie
 Simultaneously inter-caste marriages should be promoted
 mulaayam singh kii raajnneetik jameen hi yadav or muslim ke unke sameekaran par tikaa hua he

 Shirin Mirza, who plays the character of Simany, Divyanka Tripathi's sister in Ekta Kapoor's superhit show Yeh Hai Mohabbatein, is very upset these days
 actress kii is pareshaani kii vajah mumbai main ghar nahin mil paanaa he
 The actress has shared her pain on Facebook
 unhone likhaa ki main mumbai main ek ghar lene ke kaabil nahin hum, isaki vajah he meraa MBA hona
 This MBA means being a Muslim, Bachelor, Actor
 unhone ek tasviir bhi post kii jo unke shuruaati dinon kii he
 He wrote that this picture is from when i came to Mumbai to start my career
 aaj kareeb 8 saal biit gaye hai
 What i found here 
 
 i don't deserve to get a house in Mumbai because I'm m b a - MUSLIM, BACHELOR, ACTOR
 This pic was taken when i came here with a dream of living in Mumbai and now after spending almost 8 years in this city this is what i get to hear
 
 Firstly, Yes I'm an Actor and i do not Smoke or Drink and i have no criminal records
 So, How can they judge my character on the basis of my profession?? Second, I'm a bachelor and when i call brokers they ask me higher rents for the flats which are available saying Pay extra or u won't get it since ur a Bachelor
 My question is nuisance can be created by families too ??? Third, i called up another person and they ask me wether i am a Hindu or a Muslim and reverted back with an answer that Muslims are not preferred
 They also mentioned that take the flat on ur friend's name who's not a Muslim
 i mean what's in a name ??? There's no difference in the blood
 Renting or buying a property in the city that never sleeps
 Mumbai which prides itself on its cosmopolitan character is divided on basis of religion, profession and marital status ?? I'm shocked to see that Mumbai which has given me so much that i don't stop praising about Mumbai by calling it Aamchi Mumbai still does not have a place for me and so many of us coming from out of town still struggling with identity crises
 With a heavy heart and after many refusals my question is Do i belong to this city ?? 💔💔💔 # supportandsharea post shared bymirzashireen(@shireenmirza) onapr 3, 2018 at 5:32am pdtmem sharaab nahin piti, cigarette nahin piti, meraa koi criminal record nahin he
 Then how can others judge my character by profession
 duusari baat jab main brokar ko phone karti hum to mere single stats ke baad wo kiraaya badhaakar bataa detaa he, kyonki shaadishuda nahin hone kii vajah se mujhe ghar nahin milegaa
 When he does another, he asks whether i am a Hindu or a Muslim
 
 
 
 Today, so many years have passed, yet my struggle continues
 maine yahaan bahut kuch achiv kiya he
 In the end, i just want to ask a question whether i am a resident of Mumbai city after spending so many years and getting success or not? Let me tell you that Shirina Mirza is playing negative role in Star Plus show
 is sho kii popularity ne sho ke sabhi sitaron ko ghar-ghar main pahchaan dilaa di he
 The real color of the celebrity living in Bigg Boss house is now coming to the fore
 sho ke tisare din ghar ke ek hafte ke rashan or khaane ko lekar gauhar or armaan ne khub drama kiya
 The drama grew so much that Gauhar had to cry
 jab gauhar ro rahi thim to pahalwaan sangram unke aansu ponchney ke liye pahunch gaye
 In the pictures, the first day of Bigg Boss's house has started to explode among the family in the drama-rich 'bigg Boss 7'
 jahannumavaasiyon ko puri raat chakra chalaane ke baad jab bharpoor khaanaa nahin mila to armaan bhadke, gusse main unke haath se daal bhi gir gai
 At the same time, there was a clash between Armaan and Gauhar when the residents came to explain the issue of a week's ration to the Jahnumites
 abhi ye drama khatm hi nahin hua tha ki big bos kaa nayaa farmaan aa gaya, jisamen jannatavasi ko puure samay khadey rahane kaa task diya gaya or kaha gaya ki agar unhen baithna yaa letnaa ho to unhen jahannumavaasiyon ko chakra ghumaane ke liye kahana hoga
 Later Gauhar then came to talk to Armaan and sat there for his own companions that those people talk something inside and come out and say something
 bas, phir kya tha peeche se anitha adwani or tanisha ne aakar virodh kiya or vahaan se chal pade, lekin gauhar ne apana drama jari rakhaa or armaan ke saath phir bahes main ulajh gai or ro bhi padin

 Pahwan Sangram was saddened to see Gauhar weeping and rushed to wipe his tears

 i would request the National Executive to release the minutes of the meeting
 ' gandhi ne likhaa, '26 farvari kii raat ko jab rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy arvind kejariwal se milanaa chaahate the, to arvind ne ye sandesh diya ki agar ye do sadsy PAC main rahenge to wo sanyojak ke taur par kaary nahin kar paaenge
 This was the background of the National Executive meeting held on 4 March
 'gandhi ne bataaya, 'dilli ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan prashanth bhushan ne kai baar dhamkee di thi ki ve party ke khilaaf press conference karenge kyonki unhen ummidavaaron ke chayan par kuch aapatti thi
 Some of us somehow managed to keep him calm till the election
 aarope laga tha ki yogendra yadav arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf sajeesh kar rahe hai or iske kuch saboot bhi pesh kiye gaye
 Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav had a never-ending feud
 unke bich bharosa bhi bahut kam ho chukaa tha
 'as Gandhi,' Yogendra Yadav said that he can understand that Arvind does not want to see him in PAC, it is difficult to work together so he and Prashant will stay out of PAC but they should not be excluded
 unhone do formule pesh kiye
 -PAC be reorganized and new members are elected
 PAC ke chunaav main prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav apni ummidavaari pesh nahin karenge
 -PAC continues to function in its present form and Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan will not attend any meetings
 mayank gandhi ne buudhvaar ko PAC kii voting main hissaa nahin liya or unhone apane khule khat main isaki vajah bhi bataai he
 He wrote, 'arvind needs to work well in PAC
 isliye main is baat se sahamat hum ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav PAC se baahar rah sakate hai or kuch duusari mahatvapurn bhoomika le sakate hai
 i was opposed to the proposal to keep them out in public and especially when they were willing to withdraw themselves
 unhen hataane kaa ye faisla duniyabar ke kaaryakartaaon kii bhaawanaaon ke khilaaf tha
 i agreed that they could go out of the PAC, but the feeling and manner behind it was not acceptable to me
 isliye maine gaiyr hajir rahane kaa faisla kiya

 He was asked not to give any such training
 police ko nahin mili sabutahaalanki, is soochna ke baad police deraa mukhyalay main talaashi lee thi
 But the police did not find evidence in relation to arms training

 According to the meteorological forecast for the week, the temperature will go down by 2 to 3 degrees from November 30 to December 2, due to which people will feel more cold
 iske alaava philhal kisi western disterbence kii ummid nahi hai isiilie barish ke asaar bhi najar nahin hai
 In such a situation, the Meteorological Department has not made any predictions for Delhi's chill vibrancy cold, which means that at present, the capital will have to spend this light pink cold with a little sun

 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the way the BSP supremo Mayawati is attacking the Samajwadi Party and its president Akhilesh Yadav, one after another, has provoked the SP camp
 akhilesh ne is mudde par party netaaon ko kisi bhi tarah kii bayaanbaji se roak rakhaa he, jiske chalate sapa netaa basapa or mayawati ke khilaaf apni bhadaas ko dabaae rakhane par majaboor hai lekin andarkhaane maaya se mili dhokhe kaa badla lene kaa blue print bhi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Attempts have been made to breach Maya's vote bank, which Akhilesh Yadav wants to execute through contact and dialogue formulas
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan kar chunavi maidan main utarane se sabase zyada phaayde main mayawati raheen
 The BSP reached 10 seats from zero in the state and its vote bank remained the same as in the previous election
 vahiin, akhilesh yadav gathbandhan main apni siyaasi jamaapunji lutaa baithe
 Their votes were reduced by three per cent
 party pichley chunaav kii tarah paanch siten to jeet gai, lekin uske apane hi majboot garh kannauj main dimple yadav, badaayun main dharmendra yadav or firozabad main akshay yadav haar gaye
 On Mayawati's allegations, sp's chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says that Akhilesh Yadav's character is not going to deceive anyone
 loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ne puri eemaandaaree se gathbandhan dharm nibhaayaa he
 Despite this, Mayawati broke the alliance with Samajwadi Party and announced to fight alone in the by-elections
 mayawati ke lagaataar hamalon par akhilesh yadav khamoshi akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 SP leaders are seeing an advantage in this silence
 ek varisht sapa netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki chaahe to party mayawati ke aaropon kaa palatakar jawaab de sakati he, lekin isse sthitiyaan bigadengi, kyonki sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan sirf do dalon kaa gathbandhan nahin tha balki janata kaa khaskar dalit-yadav samudaay kaa jamini str par bana gathbandhan tha
 SP feels that Dalits and backward have suffered due to Mayawati breaking the alliance
 iske alaava gathbandhan tuutane se saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai bhi kamjor hui he
 In such a situation, there is sympathy for Akhilesh Yadav among the educated sections of Dalits
 iske alaava mayawati ne apni raajnneetik viraasat jis tarah se bhai anand kumaar or bhattije akaash ko saunpi he, usase bhi daliton kaa ek tabaka basapa se ruthaa hoga
 The SP is eyeing these sections
 yahi nahin, loksabhaa chunaav ke baad upi main dalit utpeedan ke kai maamle saamne aae hai
 In Pratapgarh, the Dabangas set fire to a Dalit's hut and killed him, and in Unnao, a Dalit girl was raped
 in donon maamalon par mayawati khamoshi akhriyaar kiye raheen, vahiin akhilesh yadav ne sapa netaaon kii ek team banaakar report taiyaar karne ko kaha
 The SP is eyeing Mayawati's Dalit votebank along with bringing back its slipping mass base
 sapa ne daliton main paasi samudaay ko apane saath jodne kii ranneeti banaai he
 For this, the party will take forward all the Dalit leaders including Indrajit Saroj who came from the BSP and strengthen their base
 akhilesh yadav ne aakhri baar 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main upi ke sabhi jilon kaa daura kiya tha
 But after becoming the Chief Minister, this trend was over
 sapa netaa ne bataaya ki sansad satr khatm hone ke baad akhilesh yadav phir uttar pradesh ke sabhi jilon kaa daura karenge
 Through this tour, Akhilesh will connect and communicate with the people
 wo janata ko party kii nitiyon se avgat karaayenge or unki samasyaon ko lekar party kaaryakartaaon sang sadak par sangharsh karne ke liye utrenge
 The SP has directed its leaders, officials, district, booth and village level workers to go among the public
 party kaaryakartaaon ko samaaj ke sabhi virgon, khaskar kamjor varg tak pahunchane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Overall, the script for the political deception met Mayawati is ready and now only action is awaited

Preparations for the coronation of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi have been completed and he will take over the post of Congress President in April

 SP leader and Rampur MP Azam Khan (azam Khan) is once again in shock, this time leased to Johar Trust of Azam Khan 7
 135 hectare(150 bigha lagbhag) jameen ke patte ko radd karne kii karrwai kii gai he
 Action for cancellation of lease has been taken from SDM Sadar Court
 is ke sambandh main sarkari adhivaktaa ajay tiwari ne bataaya ki yah jameen shashan dwaara mohammad johar ali trust ke sanyukt sachiv naseer khan ko 24 june 2013 ko government grant act ke tahat patte par di gai thi
 The lease took place for 30 years while the original grade of this land was recorded in sand
 chunki ret kii jameen kaa patta nahin hona chahie tha phir aisa kar diya gaya
 Reported by the Tehsildar in this regard
 ab upjiladhikari sadar ne is jameen kii mul shrenee yani ret main darj karne ke aadesh de die
 Due to which the lease has been canceled and orders have been made to register the land in original grade sand
 darasal uttar pradesh main sapa sarkaar ke dauraan saal 2013 main ajam khan ne us jameen kaa land yuj badalawa diya or sarkari anudaan di jane vaali jameen main shaamil kara diya tha
 Now, when all kinds of investigations started against Azam Khan by changing the government, the Revenue Department has also examined it and said it is illegal to change its land use and said that it is illegal to lease land of sand along the river
 
 isliye iskaa patta nirast kiya jaataa he
 Now if Azam Khan does not get relief from any big land against the decision, then he will have to lose his hands from this land
 aapako bataa den ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa ajam khan(azam Khan) ke khilaaf vakf or sarkaar kii sampattiyon par atikaraman ke aaropon ko lekar uttar pradesh sarkaar jaanch kaaphi dinon se kara rahi he
 In a letter sent to the then Governor Ram Naik in the year 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the relevant departments are taking appropriate action against the allegations against Azam
 unhone patr main kaha, 'hamen purv mantri ajam khan dwaara vakf or sarkaar kii sampattiyon par atikaraman tathaa sarkari dhan ke durupyog ke aaropon ko lekar aapkaa patr mila he
 The concerned departments are taking appropriate action in this regard '
 isse pehle rampur se varisht congress netaa faisal khan lala ne ajam par aarope lagaae hai
 Lala made 14 allegations in the letter to the Governor, one of which is that Azam illegally displaced innocent people for the purpose of encroaching land in the name of Johar University in Rampur
 vakt bitne ke saath bagdadi kaa iesas aatankwaadi sanghatham or bhi zyada belgaum or khoonkhaar hota ja rahaa he
 No one has the exact number of how many hundred or how many thousands of unarmed militants of Baghdadi have killed so far for the last four months of occupying Iraq and Syria
 kyonki aaj bhi iraq or syria main aise naa jane kitne ilaake hai jahaan har taraf laashen padi hai par vahaan tak pahunchane vaala koi nahin he
 And in this episode, Baghdadi has now released a new video of the Iraqi army firing bullets after the video of beheading
 chaar roj pehle soshal media ke jariye ye video saamne aayaa tha
 That is, on 29 October
 is video main iraqi sainik apni fouj kii vardi main ghutanon par baitha dikhaai de rahaa he
 His two hands are tied at the back, his feet are slippers instead of shoes and his face is blurred
 us faujee ke thik peeche gan liye ek shaks bhi khadaa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This soldier, sitting in the shadow of death, is praying for the last time to his God
 jaise hi uski dua khatm hoti he or uske munh se allaah ho akbar nikalataa he, uske sir ke kareeb achaanak do aantki apni apni banduukon ko munh le aate hai or palak jhapakate hi ek saath kai goliyon uske ye he duniya ko dahalane nikle iesas kaa nayaa or khaufnak cheharaa
 Yes yes iesas ke aatankiyon ne ab duusare deshon ke nagarikon ke saath saath iraq ke bandhak banaae gaye sainikon par beraham maut barasaani shuru kar di he
 Sitting on his knees, he is the soldier of the Iraqi army who went on a rampage against ISIS militants in a war against Sunni militants and was put to death in a similar manner
 or hairat kii baat yahi he ki ab aatankiyon ne sainikon yaa iraqi nagarikon ko maut ke ghat utaarne kaa video duniya ko dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 It is thundering that the ISIS terrorists who came out of the Arabian desert to take blood, have started a new spectacle by terrorizing the hearts of the world by taking such terrifying pictures
 ek hafte main 85 se zyada kurd nagarikon ko maar daalajis iraqi faujee ko camere ke saamne goliyon se bhunkar maut ke ghat utaara gaya wo akelaa nahin tha
 Rather, it is just a hallmark of ISIS terrorists, which they have put in front of the world through social media
 agar arab se ai bikhri hui khabaron par yakeen kiya jaae to iesas ke aatankiyon ne pichley shanivaar se lekar ab tak 85 se zyada un logon ko thik isi tarah maut ke ghat utaar he or phir unki laashon ko chil or kauwon kaa niwala banane ke liye khule registan main bikher diya
 Most of those killed belong to the Kurdish tribe of Iraq and this bloody game of death was carried out on Saturday morning in the ravine of Ras al Ma of northern Ramadi
 bataaya yahi ja rahaa he ki abhi tak is jati ke 300 se zyada logon ko maut ke ghat utaara ja chukaa hai or wo bhi mahaj beete chand dinon ke bheetar
 'shoot or eat the bullet' is the only motive of ISIS to make such bloodshed
 wo ye ki iraq ke dur daraaj ke hisson main jo use aam logon se muqabla karnaa pad rahaa he
 The guns of the Iraqi people were becoming the hindrance of the terrorists
 unhen jaise bhi ho raste se hataanaa jaruri he
 This latest picture is a witness that there are only two routes left before the Iraqi people
 yaa to wo aatankiyon ko apni goli kaa nishaanaa banaaen
 Or in such a way as to be the target of their bullet with the last dua
 soshal media kaa istemaal kar rahaa bagdadiiesaes ke ladaake, iraq or syria ke kai shaharon par kabza jamaa chuke hai or kai shaharon main qatl-e-aam machaa rahe hai
 But the biggest worry for the world is that in the spiral of Baghdadi, many young people of the country are ready to bow in the furnace of terror
 or is kaam ke liye bagdadi ne hathiyaar banaaya he soshal media ko
 He is reaching out to the youth all over the world through social media and brain washing them
 abhi tak iraq or syria ke registani ilaakon kii tapati ret par insaanon kii laashen mil rahi thim
 The discovery of human corpses on the way to any village or city in Iraq had become an everyday thing
 khule maidani ilaakon main qatari main padi goliyon se chalni insaani laashen iraq main maanon ek belgaum silsilaa ban chukaa tha
 But now corpses are coming out of the well here
 paanch maheene se jari qatleam ke baad ab iraq ke logon ko un kuon se maut ke khaufnak shakl dikhaai dene lagi hai
 The wells in which life-giving water was present, and when the number of corpses released from the well, it exceeded the figure of 50
 kuen se jo laashen mili unamem zyaadaatar mahilaayein or bachche the
 They were identified as missing people from Iraq's Al Bu Nimr clan
 iraq ke maanavadhikaar mantralay kaa khulaasa he ki aies ne itvaar kii subah apane taaja hamale main is kabeeley ke logon kii goli markar hatya kii he
 The slaughter of the people of Al Bu Nimr clan is only 50 of the 65 people who were missing for the last one week
 ashanka bhi yahi jataai gai thi ki is kabeeley ke logon ko iesas ne agava kar liya he
 Iraq's official data is a witness that Baghdadi terrorists have killed more than three hundred people of this clan caste so far
 itnaa hi nahin aatankiyon ne is kabeeley ke logon ko apane kabje main karne ke saath saath unke paas maujuud tamaam gola barood bhi lut liya he
 The first of the four foreign nationals who beheaded ISIS terrorists was the head of American journalist James Foley

 The terrorists of the Islamic terror organization, who were trying to shock journalists around the world through these pictures, have now taken a new bet and if that bet is right, then believe the world will face even more frightening pictures of destruction

 yuan ke taaja adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki arab ke registan main jo ghamaasan machaa hua he
 It also includes youth from more than 80 countries in this army of terrorists
 kareeb 15000 se zyada log is jang kaa hissaa banane ke liye apane apane deshon se bhagkar iraq or syria ke un ilaakon main pahunche hai, jahaan aies ke ladake maar kaat machaa rahe hai
 IS has opened the way for youth across the world to join the army of terror and that too through social media
 report kaa ek khulaasa ye bhi he ki is sanghathan main beete do saalon ke dauraan jitne videshi noujvaan shaamil hue, utane or kisi bhi sanghathan main kabhi nahin hue
 In Iraq and Syria, there is a ruckus between the army and the militants
 vahaan aisi tasviren aksar jhandon or postaron ke saath dikhaai de jaati he
 The question is still, how long will this process last? china ke ek aise aadmi kaa video viral ho rahaa he jo pichley 20 saal se ladki kii tarah rah rahaa he
 He is 50 years old
 bahan kii maut ke baad, apni maa kii maansik haalat ko sudhaarney ke liye usne aisa kiya
 Millions of people have seen this video of the Pear Company on the social site
 video main dikh rahaa he ki shaks apni biimaar maa ke paas he or vah paaramparikchineedress pahane hue he
 Both live in Guilin, Guangxi region
 china ke soshal media par bhi shaks kaa videotrendkar rahaa he
 Many are praising the man for his unprecedented courage
 to kai log uski sundarataa kii baat bhi kar rahe hai
 At the same time, some people are afraid that the person is not hiding anything
 jab shaks ne apni bahan ke kapade pahanane shuru kiye to uski maa ko laga tha ki beti laut ai he
 She also saw happiness on the mother's face
 iske baad vah isi tarah ke kapade pahanane laga or maa ke saamne beti kii tarah baat bhi karata tha
 In a conversation with the media, the man has said that he has not worn men's clothes since then
 iske liye vah apni aalochana kii bhi parvaah nahin karata
 However, the man's name could not be revealed

 - It will help to keep an eye on enemy radars and sensors deployed on the borders
 - dushman ke ilaakon kaa sateek electronic nakshaa banane main madad yani agar koi hamaare khilaaf sajeesh rach rahaa hoga, to usapar bharat kii nazar rahegi
 - Will give accurate information about other communication devices including mobiles on the borders
 udhaaharan ke taur par border par maujuud aatanki addon par koun or kitne log active hai isaki nigaraanee karne main bharat ko aasaani rahegi
 - Will decode conversations via mobile and communication devices
 aisa pehali baar hua
 
 
 This will be the first time in India when ISRO has opened this launch to the general public, today around 1000 people saw the scene live
 iske liye isro ne ek stadium numa manch taiyaar kiya tha, jahaan par logon ke baithne kii vyavastha he
 Earlier, the US agency NASA used to do this, when it kept such projection open to the common people
 kai deshon ke upgrah hue launchisro ne aaj pieselvi-si45 rocket ke dwaara apane emisat ko to launch kiye hi balki kai anya deshon ke upgrahon ko bhi launch kiya
 These included 24 satellites from the US, two from Lithuania and one each from Spain and Switzerland
 isse pehle bhi bharat kaa isro ek saath 104 upgrah bhejne kaa record bana chukaa he
 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has advised his teammates to focus only on the basics rather than worrying about the outcome of the tri-series final against Sri Lanka
 bharat ne june main srilanka ko asia cap ke final main haraaya tha or dhoni kii team apana yah vijay abhiyaan jari rakhane kii koshish karegi
 Dhoni arrived at the press conference 45 minutes after the scheduled event on the eve of the match
 unhone kaha, ‘‘meraa maananaa he ki choti-choti baaten kaaphi myne rakhti hai
 If you take care of the small things, then the big things improve themselves, so we need to take care of the small things and follow the basics
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘yah nirbhar karegaa ki aap pehle ballebaaji karte ho yaa gendbaaji
 If we bowl first, we will try to take advantage of the circumstances
 is maidan par tej hawa chalati he or gendbaaj uski madad lekar shuru main wicket lekar pratidwandvi team ko kam score par samet sakate hai
 Dhoni said, "fielding will be important, because every ten runs of the opposing team will be very important in the end
 mujhe lagata he ki hamen basics par puraa dhyaan dena hoga
 The Indian captain said that the teams in the tri-series have struggled on the vibrant pitch of the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium and their team is not worried about the performance so far
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yadi aap kisi cheez ko lekar chintaa shuru kar do, to khilaadi hameshaa chintit rahenge
 It was a series of ups and downs not only for our batsmen but also for all three teams
 ’’lig charan main donon timen vivaadon se ghiri rahi
 The first Nobel episode took place and later the umpires' wrong decisions, but Dhoni hoped that Saturday's match would be played with full sportsmanship
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham jitna sambhav ho, vivaadon se bachanaa chahenge
 In between, we saw that a batsman was fined
 kabhi captain par dhimi over gati ke liye jurmaana lag jaataa he
 You have to go ahead with it
 aashaa he ki aage koi vivaad nahin hoga, haalanki ham match par pakad banane ke liye kadaa khel khelenge
 "dhoni said," Our strong side is not to fight the verbal war by getting on the field
 ham aisi team hai, jo gendbaaj kaa hausala badhaate hai, lekin saath hi ballebaaj ke saath bahut dostana ravaiya nahin dikhaate, isliye ham pratidwandvi ballebaaj se duuri banaaye rakhenge
 On the batting performance of the batsmen, he said, "yes, this is a big concern, but hope we do well tomorrow
" hamen itnaa score bananaa hoga jiskaa gendbaaj bachaav kar saken
 How did we achieve this score? yah myne nahin rakhata ki kisi ne acchhee pari kheli or ham 220 yaa 240 ran kaa score banane main safal rahe
 The absence of Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh has affected our lower-order batting, but the bowlers' main job is to bowl well

 aapaki or hamaari tarah maahi ko bond kitne pasand hai, yah bataanaa mushkil he, lekin bond kii tarah hi maahi number 7 main jabardast yakeen karte hai
 The number 7 is considered auspicious for you and gives full importance to this number in your personal life
 tippaniyan Many believe that the secret of this success of Mahi is hidden in number 7

 The seventh month of the year, the date and the sum of the years also become 7
 dhoni 7 number kii jersey pahante he, chaahe vah vanade ho yaa koi tii−20 match
 Last year, Dhoni also signed agreements with many big companies keeping 7 in mind
 dhoni kii gaadi or bike main bhi kisi na kisi tarah number 7 jarur hota he
 The strength of this number 7 theory also comes from the fact that Dhoni won the World Cup in the seventh year of his cricketing career, which he had not been able to captain for the last 28 years
 kai log maanate hai ki maahi kii is safalataa kaa raaj chupa he number 7 main
 Dhoni's date of birth is 07−07−81

 Dhoni wears a number 7 jersey, whether it is an ODI or a T-20 match
 pichley saal kai badi companiyon se qaraar bhi dhoni ne 7 ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hi kiya
 There is definitely a number 7 in Dhoni's car and bike too
 7 number kii is theory ko bal is baat se bhi miltaa he ki dhoni ne apane cricketting kariyar ke saatven saal main world cap jitkar vah karnama kar diya, jo pichley 28 saal se koi captain nahin kar paaya tha

 Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron, Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohit Sharma and Ashok Dinda, five of these eight bowlers are likely to join the 15-man squad
 7 janvari ko world cap ke liye 15 sadasyeey team kii list jari hogi
 Talking about performance and experience, the cut of Ishant, Bhuvi, Shami, Umesh and Varun's World Cup tickets seems almost certain
 vahiin dhaval, mohit or dinda ko sambhaviton main jagah banane ke baad niraashaa kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Interestingly, none of the fast bowlers involved in the probables have any experience of playing in the World Cup
 ab ek najar daalate hai in paanch gendbaajon par jinke kandhon par hogi team india ke khitaab bachaane kii baari jimmedaari
 Ishant Sharma: Ishant will be the most experienced bowler for India in a pace attack
 eshanth ne 75 vanade maichon main 31
 There are 106 wickets at an average of 25
 is dauraan 34 ran par chaar wicket unka best parformens rahaa he
 Ishant played 9 matches and 20 on Australian pitches
 42 kii ausat se 14 wicket jatke hai
 His best performance is also on Australian soil
 itnaa hi nahin australian pichon par eshanth ne mahaj 4
 Runs are at an economy rate of 60, while overall their economy rate is 5
 69 kaa he
 Ishant has played just 4 matches in New Zealand and his performance during this period has not been special
 unhone kiwi pichon par 47
 There are 5 wickets at an average of 60
 eshanth ke anubhav kaa team india jarur phayda uthaanaa chaahegi
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar: In the last few years Bhuvi has made his strong place in the team
 is gendbaaj ko 2014 kaa isisi pipuls chwwis aword bhi diya gaya
 Bhuvi scored 36 in 42 odis
 59 ke ausat se 44 wicket jatke hai or is dauraan unka iconmi rate 4
 It has been 60
 best bowling parformens bhuvi kii 8 ran dekar chaar wicket he
 Apart from bowling, Bhuvi can also bat well in the lower order, which he has shown on the tour of England
 bhuvi abhi tak australia main nahin khele hai lekin bharat ke maujuuda daure par unhen australian pichon par khilne kaa anubhav mil jayega
 His performance on the New Zealand pitches was nothing special and he could take just 4 wickets in 5 matches
 vahaan unka iconmi rate 5
 Was 43
 bhuvi ke paas bhale hi raftaar na ho lekin veriation or swing unka euaspy he
 Mohammed Shami: Like Bhuvaneshwar, Mohammed Shami has also made a strong place in Team India
 shami ne 36 vanade maichon main 26
 He has 68 wickets at an average of 08, while his economy rate is 5
 74 kaa rahaa he
 Shami's best performance is four wickets after spending 36 runs
 shami ne bhi australia main abhi tak koi international match nahin khelaa he lekin maujuuda daure par unhone iskaa anubhav mil jayega
 Shami may have proved expensive on New Zealand pitches, but he also took wickets
 newjiland main shami ne 5 vanade match khele or 28
 11 wickets at an average of 72
 is dauraan unka iconmi rate 7
 It was 18
 shami ke saath bhi plus point ye he ki wo telendar hone ke baavjood kuch ran jod sakate hai
 Shami bowls slowly but gets the ball moving well
 acchhee line or length shami kaa euaspy he
 Umesh Yadav: On New Zealand and Australian pitches, Umesh can prove to be successful at his own pace
 umesh yadav tej raftaar se gend phenkate hai or line or length bhi banaae rakhte hai
 Umesh has an experience of 38 odis
 is dauraan unhone 36
 Average of 5 and 5
 89 ke iconmi rate se 47 wicket jatke hai

 umesh ne australian pichon par 6 match khele hai or 59
 There are 5 wickets at an average of 80
 2012 main srilanka or mejabaan team ke khilaaf tri siries main bhale hi umesh yadav kaa pradarshan bahut joardaar naa rahaa ho lekin do saal main is gendbaaj ke andar parivakvata ai he
 Umesh has learned to control the line and length with speed
 varun aronhmaujuuda samay main eron team india ke sabase tej gendbaaj hai
 Aaron has experienced only 9 One Day Internationals during which his performances have been mixed
 australia main hue practice maichon main eron ne badhiya gendbaaji kii or agar yah pradarshan test or tri vanade siries main bhi jari rahata he to unka world cap main khelnaa lagbhag tay he
 Aaron scored 38 from 9 matches
 09 kii ausat se 11 wicket jatke hai, is dauraan unka iconmi rate 6
 Has been 61
 eron ke liye sabase badi dikkat he ki wo raftaar ke saath line length control nahin kar pate or ran kharch dete hai
 Aaron has played 3 matches in New Zealand, during this time he has 7
 03 ke iconmi rate or 40
 Four wickets at an average of 75
 eron agar raftaar ke saath line length control karnaa sikh jaaen to unki jagah bhi team main pakki ho jaaegi
 This will be the playing eleven of the playing XI! Team India can get down in the World Cup matches with the combination of three fast bowlers
 jabaki ek spinner or ek olerounder baaki ke 20 over puraa karegaa
 Also it would not be surprising if the team goes down with four bowlers
 3+1 ke formule main bhuvi or shami kaa khelnaa to lagbhag tay jabaki teesraa gendbaaj ke taur par eshanth or umesh main kadaa muqabla ho saktaa he

 India has welcomed China by spreading its arms at the International Trade Fair, which runs from 14 November to 27 November every year in Delhi
 ye ham isliye kah rahe hai kyonki vyapaar ke is sabase bade meley main videshi pavilionon main duusare deshon ke mukaable china ko baqayda ek alag hanger diya gaya he
 According to ITPO general manager Jay Guna Sekaran, more than 225 companies from many countries including Indonesia, Iraq, UK, Thailand, UAE, China, Turkey, Afghanistan, South Africa, Vietnam are participating in this fair

 But this year China has been given a separate hangar
 haalanki is hanger main china ke alaava kuch duusare exibitrers bhi maujuud hai
 But most of the stalls are from China
 ye alag baat he ki china is saal apane utpaadon se zyada apane takanic ke saath trade fere main aayaa he
 So there are of course more Chinese stalls, but the shoppers are not happy with China
 yahaan aa rahe logon ke mutabik chini saamaan kaa bahishkaar karne jaisi koi baat nahin he
 But China did not bring anything special this time which should be bought
 jitne bhi stall hai wo takanic sambandhi he, aise main vyapaariyon ke liye phir bhi kuch opshan hai, lekin aam kharidaaron ke liye kuch khaas nahin
 More than 225 exhibitors from many countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, South Korea, Myanmar, South Africa, China, UAE, UK are taking part in the Hissais Bar Trade Fair not taking place in Pakistan
 lekin pichley saal kii hi tarah pakistan is saal bhi trade fere main bhaag nahin le rahaa he
 Therefore, people fond of Pakistani suits and spices also looked a little disappointed

 jaise jab aapke mithravat vyavhaar ko sex kii khwaahish jaahir karne ke rup main liya gaya ho? ek rochak adhyayan main pataa chalaa he ki jahaan zyaadaatar mahilaon kaa maananaa he ki saathi purush unke mithravat vyavhaar ko sex ke sanket ke rup main lete hai, vahiin purushon kaa maananaa he ki mahilaayein aksar purushon kii sex kii khwaahish ko mitrataa samaj baithti hai
 Researcher Monse Bendikjen of Norway Science and Technological University (NTNU) has said that research decisions are not shocking if viewed from a development perspective
 research team ne 308 pratibhaagiyon ke saath yah adhyayan kiya, jinaki umr 18 varsh se 30 varsh ke bich thi
 Among them, 59 percent were women
 research ke mutabik purushon or mahilaon ne paaya gaya ki unke vipareet lingi saathiyon ne unki dosti kaa galat matlab nikaala
 According to the research published in the research magazine 'evolutionary Psychology', female participants said that when they showed friendly behavior towards a male partner, about 3 during the last one year
 5 baar uskaa sex kii khwaahish hone kaa matlab nikaala gaya
 Men also expressed similar distress from fellow women, although the percentage was lower in the case of men
 research ke mutabik agar vikasvaadi manovigyaan ke nazariye se dekha jaae to ise zyada acchhee tarah samajha ja saktaa he ki aksar purush kyon mahila saathiyon se baatcheet ke dauraan muskuraane or hansane ko sex kii ichha vyakt karne ke rup main le lete hai
 Bendikjen makes it clear that a man's ability to procreate depends on how many women he has the ability to conceive
 is tarah purushon ke liye sex kaa maamla kahin kam jokhim vaala ho jaataa he or kisi mahila ke saath sex uske liye kisi avasar kii tarah hota he
 But this is not the case with women
 mahilaon ke liye is tarah kaa sambandh adhik jokhim bharaa rahata he, kyonki uske saamne garbhvatee hone, baccha paidaa karne, unka paalan-poshan karne kaa jokhim ho saktaa he or saath hi duusare purush ke saath sex karke bachche paidaa karne kaa avasar kam karne vaala hota he

 jaahir he ki ye saaf nahin ho paa rahaa ki aam aadmi party ke naam se ye check kisne jari kiye or inke haath kaise lage
 The Aam Aadmi Party is also not clearly telling whether it has anything to do with these check issuing companies or not? Aam Aadmi Party leader Dilip Pandey said - you will have any company, you will give me money, talk about these checks and companies, do not ask those who have brought fake checks
 tippaniyan These two checks are deducted in the name of the Aam Aadmi Party, but they are being made cash politically by Kapil Mishra and his associates, because neither the companies issuing the checks have any knowledge and there is no direct answer to this

Former Commissioner of Municipal Corporation held responsible Water situation due to poor working style: In Patna, the Municipal Development Minister Suresh Sharma has held the former Municipal Commissioner responsible for the situation of water logging caused by rain for the past 1 week
 suresh sharma ne nagar nigam ke purv ayukta anupam kumaar suman par aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki kuch din pehle hi purv ayukta anupam kumaar suman ne sarkari naukari se istipha de diya he par jab ve apane pad par the tab manamaujee tareeke se kaam kiya karte the
 Who is responsible? Suresh Sharma said that the reason for the functioning of the former corporation commissioner was due to which the drains were not cleaned in due time, due to which the situation of water logging occurred in the capital from 1 week
 suresh sharma ne kaha ki patna ke halaat ko behatar banane main jin sarkari adhikariyon ko doshi paaya jayega unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 Sharma said that the state government is very serious about the problems faced by the people and they are making efforts to drain water from all the areas as soon as possible
 maafee maangane se inkaarhalanki, ajtak se baatcheet karte hue jab suresh sharma se poocha gaya ki kya vah patna waalon ko hui musiibat ke liye unase maafee maangenge to mantri suresh sharma ne maafee maangane se inkaar kar diya
 Suresh Sharma said that he was sad that the people of Patna are facing a lot of trouble due to the water logging situation and the government is trying to get out of the trouble but he refused to apologize

 Confidential Mode This mode is given in the new Gmail
 iske tahat sender kisisamvedansheel email bhej kar expyridet set kar saktaa he taaki us email ko puri tarah se waapas liya ja sake
 In fact, for this, Google does not send sensitive content directly and sends a link to this content, which the receiver can open via Gmail
 isamen email bhejne vaale ko yah adhikaar he ki use kabhi bhi mail waapas le
 Email snoozing / smart replyingmail has introduced this new feature on its platform
 smart riplai mobile ap par pehle se hi diya gaya tha ab aapako jimail web par bhi yahi feechar diya jayega

 On Saturday, 23 February, top officials were watching some blurry pictures on 84-inch TV screens at the Intelligence Bureau headquarters at Sardar Patel Marg, 35, in the capital, Delhi
 ve do roj pehle hyderabad visphot sthal kii sisitivi footage main sandigdhon kii pahchaan karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 The blasts killed 16 people and injured 156 people
 adhikariyon ne cycle par savaar ek vyakti kii tasviir ko dhyaan se dekha
 There was a box kept on his bicycle career
 ek adhikari bolaa, ‘‘yahi he vah
 This is what has placed the bomb
 ’’ us vyakti kii tulana indian mujahidin ke pramukh 30 saal ke yaccin bhatkal kii badi-si tasviir se karte hue duusare adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘vah yaccin bhatkal jaisaa dikh rahaa he
 "but then the third officer turned on all the excitement, saying," The bicycle shown on the screen has a bell, while the bicycle used in the blast was without a bell
 ’’yah footage un 60 ghanton kii recording kaa hissaa thi jo jaanchakartaaon ko aatankiyon kaa nishaanaa bane dilasukhanagar kshetra main lage sisitivi camaron se mili thi
 Another shot from the blur showed three suspicious people near a bicycle
 in footage kii jaanch andhra pradesh police or rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) bhi kar rahi he
 But most of the footage is extremely blurred
 ibi aatanki hamalon ko rokane main naakaam rahaa he
 This is because he does not have any concrete information on which to take any action, and then he also fails to understand the intelligence of the investigators
 vah bhi is tathy ke baavjood ki ibi ke multi agency centre (emesi) main vibhinn agenciyon or rajyon se milane vaali jaankaree jamaa hoti he
 The MAC is expected to provide information in the form of 'alerts' to the respective states
 yah jaankaree shaayad kabhi sateek hoti he
 After the attack in Mumbai on 26 / 11 in a mutual battle, the then Home Minister P
K
 chidambaram ne emesi kaa gathan kiya tha
 He also tried to create the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) and the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) to collect information from different databases of the country in one place
 lekin ensitisi ab centre or rajyon ke bich kii ladaai main funs gaya he
 Actually, IB does not want an independent NCTC whereas states do not want NCTC to function under IB
 vahiin, lalaphitaashahee ke kaaran natgrid ne to ab tak kaam karnaa bhi shuru nahin kiya he
 The US has been able to stop all the major attacks after its attack on 9 / 11 (2001) and Britain 7 / 7 (2005), while India's badly scattered intelligence system is still battling with each other
 
 america ne na keval fedral beuro of investigeshan (epabiai) ko or majboot banaaya he, balki aatank se ekajute hokar nibatane ke liye usne ensitisi kaa gathan bhi kiya he
 FBI is like a combination of IB and CBI in India
 ibi kii apni samasyaayein bhi kam nahin hai
 It has very few people (operatives) to work at the ground level
 jo log ibi ke liye kaam kar rahe hai, unke paas bhi soochnaaon ko samajhane ke liye jaruri prashikshan or takneekon kaa abhaav he
 The number of alerts that the agency issues to the states, the location or time-specific information is not available from anyone
 aise main ye sabhi alert ‘karrwai yogya nahin’ kii shrenee main aa jate hai
 On top of that, the state police do not take these IB alerts too seriously as they get around 250 such alerts every day
 kolkata ke shakespeare sarani police thane ke paas isaki koi safai maujuud nahin he ki disambar 2009 main chori ke ek maamle main giraftaar kiye gaye yaccin bhatkal ko aakhir usne kyon chhod diya
 Yasin managed to convince the police that he was Bulla Mallick, the son of Karthik Mallick, a resident of 'number 9 North Range, Kolkata-17'
 or police ne us par vishwaas bhi kar liya kyonki unke paas bharat ke is most wanted aatankwaadi or hyderabad main agast 2007 main hue bam dhamaakon tathaa sitambar 2008 bam dhamaakon ke mukhya aaropee kii koi tasviir maujuud nahin thi
 This is because the IB shared photographs of Yasin and IM co-founders Iqbal and Riyaz Bhatkal with only those intelligence agencies that are part of the MAC
 adarsh sthiti to yah hoti ki ibi in tasveeron ko emesi kii rajya ikaayiyon ke saath saz karata, phir ye ikaiyaan tasveeron ko jila or sthaneey police thanon tak pahunchaatin
 But it was not done, which is like a crack in the intelligence chain
 desh main 2007 ke baad se hue aatanki hamalon ke peeche bhatkal bandhuon kaa hi haath rahaa he lekin ve ab bhi ibi kii pahunch se bahut dur hai
 IM has its roots in India, it is formed here and it is not very much related to Pakistan's lashkar-e-taiba
 aatanki gatividhiyon ko anjaam dene ke liye iem ko iesai se paisa miltaa he
 After the ban on SIMI in India, many of its activists were joined by IM
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aatanki ghatnaon ko anjaam dene ke liye iem sthaneey or ek sadasyeey sleeper cell kaa istemaal karata he
 The IB says that it is difficult for him to make a dent in this organization because in this alone people do work and return to their everyday lives
 koshish main kamiibi ko tab bhi yaccin ke bare main koi khabar nahin thi jab vah dilli main rah rahaa tha
 He lived in the Shaheen Bagh area of south Delhi in 2008 and again in 2011
 2008 main uske saath yahaan par riyaj or ikbaal bhi rahe the
 Yasin was coming back to Delhi again in late 2011, after the February 2010 blasts in Pune and the July 2011 serial blasts in Mumbai
 field oparative ke rup main kaam kar chuke ibi ke purv diarector ajit kumaar dobhaal kehete hai ki ‘khatre se bhidde’ ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 According to Doval, clues are still found but they need to make an effort to reach their logical end
 neshnal counter terarysm centre banane kii joardaar pairvi karne vaale dobhaal ke mutabik, ‘‘chunki oparative jhatpat hal chaahate hai, lihaaja suchanaaen ikatthi karne kaa kaam sust pad gaya he
 "monitoring the Internet and tapping phones have become a major source of information gathering
" lekin vishwasaneeyata ke maamle main ye sutron se mili jaankaree kii barabari nahin kar sakate
 Desired information can be obtained by digging from the person to convert it into actionable information
 jabaki phone tap ke jariye hasil kii gai soochna se atirikt jaankaree nahin mil paati
 This is the reason why 'alerts' are becoming more and more unclear day by day
 dobhaal kehete hai, ‘‘ek sakasham netritv kii jarurat he, jo apane logon ko protsaahit kar sake
 There is also a need to change the way we work and the strategy because the current system is not working for us
 ’’nai takneekon kii jaruratsitambar 2011 main ek conference ko sambodhit karte hue tatkaaleen ibi pramukh nehchal sandhu ne yah sweekaar kiya tha ki police tantra itnaa tej or chust nahin he ki aatankwaadiyon ke mukaable apni chaalon or ranneetiyon ko badal sake
 He said, "terrorists work in small groups
 isliye ho saktaa he ki hamen apni puraani takneekon ko chhodkar unki jagah nai takneekein apnaani paden
 "but while the IB is becoming more and more dependent on technology, it is still behind the terrorists in terms of technology
 jab khufia agenciyon ne aatanvaadiyon kii mobile phone par baatcheet sunani shuru kii thi, tab tak aatankwaadi satellite phone kaa istemaal karne lage the
 The then RAW chief B
 After the 26 / 11 attack
 ke
 Chaturvedi had publicly claimed that monitoring the Thuraya satellite phone gave him information about the whereabouts of the terrorists' bosses, which he had shared
 iske baad aatankwaadiyon ne raturaat 10 dollar main uplabdh lokation spoofing aplication (lokation ko gupt rakhane vaali aplication) kaa istemaal shuru kar diya tha
 Due to which this means of collecting information of intelligence agencies also stopped
 ab aatankwaadi sanghathan nae inmarsat satellite phone kaa istemaal karne lage hai
 These phones convert voice into complex encryption
 maanav sansaadhan kii baari kamiibi main lagbhag 25,000 log kaam karte hai
 This number is about 10,000 less than the sanctioned human resources figure for IB
 sabase zyada kami grad 2 str ke adhikariyon kii he-ye field oparative hote hai jinhen agency kii ridh kii haddi mana jaataa he
 a senior IB official says, "the youth applying for the grade 2 post only want a secure government job
" unka prayaas yah hota he ki unhen surakshit or aaramdaayak asinament mili
 "even top level officials do not want to come to IB on deputation
 adhikari kabhi ibi main niyukti ko apane kariyar ke liye acha maanate the lekin is pramukh jaanch agency main koi janaa nahin chahta or usamen niyukti maano jabaran hoti he
 Promotion in the police forces of the states is quick and money is also increased
 vakt badalane ke saath hi ibi ke oparative kii training main bhi kai badlaavon kii jarurat he kyonki pichley kai dashakon se isaki prakriya main koi parivartan nahin aayaa he
 Will the new IB director Syed Asif Ibrahim be able to bring any change? Ibrahim, a 1977-batch IPS officer, is its first Muslim chief in the 125-year history of the IB
 lekin dashakon tak khufia vibhaag main rah chuke adhikariyon ko andeh he ki ibi khaskar vipaksh ke netaaon kii khufia jaankaree nikaalane ke apane kaam se chhutkaaraa paa sakegaa
 The security of the nation does not figure in the priority list for the UPA government
 doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha he ki sarkaar mobile upabhoktaaon ke liye rashtriya str par muft roming suvidha is saal oktober se pehle shuru karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 On the occasion of the inauguration of the National Internet Registry (NIR), Sibal said, 'telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has brought out a discussion paper on free roaming at the national level
 aise main tri kii siforishein aane ke baad ham oktober se pehle muft roming seva shuru karne kaa prayaas karenge
 'in December, TRAI had taken out a discussion paper to take stockholders' views on fees for national roaming services
 isamen anshadharakon se rashtriya roming sevaaon par kai prakaar ke vichaar maange gaye the
 For example, consideration was sought for the cost of call rates, methods of cost recovery after incoming calls were made free, rates of video calls and SMS during roaming and permission to issue special rate vouchers for consumers with roaming
 philhal doorsanchaar operataron ko anya operataron ke network par apane upabhokta kii kol ko puraa karne ke liye kai prakaar ke shulk masalan termination shulk, interconect shulk aadi kaa bhugtan karnaa hota he
 When asked by the Empowered Group of Ministers to allow the Indian unit of Norway-based Telenor to adjust the license fee of Rs 1,658 crore made in 2008 for the purchase of spectrum, Sibal said that the decision is for other companies as well
 
 doorsanchaar mantri ne kaha ki adhikaar praapt mantri samooh dwaara faisla kiya gaya he ki jin bhi companiyon ke license radd hue the or unhone taaja spectrum nilaamee main bhaag liya he, ve purv main chukaaye gaye license shulk ko spectrum ke bhugtan main samyojit kar sakenge
 The issue of spectrum auction was discussed in the Empowered Group of Ministers meeting on Wednesday under the leadership of Finance Minister p Chidambaram
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘dhaancha vahi he
 The majority stake is that of Telenar
 is vajah se hamane yah kiya
 It will only be adjusted, not returned
 ’ sibbal ne rashtriya internet registry kii bhi shuruyaat kii

 The Delhi government has prepared a daub on the circular that justifies the 2 finger test to investigate the rape
 sutron ke mutabik circular ke bare main swasthya mantri satendra jain ko jaankaree nahin thi
 After the circular was released, the Health Minister called a review meeting on the issue
 mana ja rahaa he ki apni chhavi bachaane ke liekejariwal sarkarcircular jari karne vaale adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai kar sakati he
 Know what is Two Finger Test: Delhi government immediately withdrew it after issuing a circular to justify 2 finger test for rape investigation
 dilli sarkaar ne visheshgyon ke 14 prishthon ke dastavej ke aadhaar par 2 finger test ko uchit tehraate hue adwijuri jari kii thi
 In which it was said that for the convenience of the doctors who are investigating the rape, it is not right to impose a complete ban on this test, as well as removing the test will make it difficult to examine the rape objectively
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he kiyon hinsa kii jaanchake liye is test ke istemaal kaa samay-samay par virodh hota rahaa he
 2 Finger test, also known as 'PV test', is used to test for rape
 isamen mahila ke guptang main ungliyaan daal kar andruni choton kii jaanch kii jaati he
 Many organizations working for women have opposed this test
 is test ke virodh karne ke peeche ek vajah yah bhi he ki is test dwaara yah jaanch kii jaati he ki rape kii shikaar mahila sex kii aadi he yaa nahin
 In 2013, the Supreme Court commented on this test, saying that this test violates the right to privacy of the rape survivor
 sheersh court ne sarkaar ko rape kii jaanch ke liye behatar tarika istemaal karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Child rights activist Raj Mangal Prasad says, 'it is now well known that the 2 finger test is a non-essential test to investigate sexual violence
 yah pehle se yon hinsa ke shikaar ke saath duusari baar rape karne jaisaa he
 However, according to a government source, the government did not impose this test on anyone
 yah adwijuri sirf is masale par sarkaar kaa paksh saamne rakhane ke liye jari kii gai he
 It is clearly written in the advisory that before taking this test it is necessary to get the approval of the victim
 ' ye alag baat he ki kai enjio ke mutabik sarkari aspataalon main yah test dhadlle se chalata he
 In many cases, the opinion is not taken from the victim

 bharat main superbike racing ko badhaava dene ke uddeshy se greater noida sthit buddha international circuit par pahunche keenan ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘mujhe pataa he ki dhoni ke paas dher sari bike hai

 motorbike ke prati bhi jununee dhoni ne 2012 main maahi racing team kii shuruyaat kii thi jo bharat kii pehali superbike racing team he
 The team got off to a good start in 2013 and its Turkish rider Keenan managed to win the first race at Phillip Island, Australia, while the team's second rider, Fabian Foret of France, finished fourth
 teen baar ke vishwa champion keenan ne kaha, ‘pichhali baar jab main yahaan aayaa to dhoni se meri sankshipt mulaakaat hui thi, lekin is baar maine unase lambii baatcheet kii
 We talked about our family, bikes, their tires, speed etc
 mere yahaan log cricket ke bare main zyada nahin jaanate lekin maine ab is khel kaa anusaran karnaa shuru kar diya he
 He said, 'I came to know that Dhoni is such a big star here but his behavior is very good
 mujhe vyaktigat taur par aise log pasand hai
 He is the champion of his sport and i believe that our racing team will also become champions
 ’keenan ne haalanki dhoni kii team se judane se pehle kaaphi vichaar vimarsh kiya tha kyonki tab motorbike ke khatarnaak kariyar ko jari rakhane ke liye unki maa ne hi manaa kar diya tha
 He said, 'my younger brother died while crossing the road in front of the house in 2002
 mere bade bhai 2008 main motorracing main jaan ganvaa baithe
 After this my father died in 2011 at the age of 54
 teen bhaiyon main main akelaa rah gaya hum
 My mother was very worried
 ’keenan ne kaha, ‘maa ne mujhe racing chhodane ke liye kaha
 i told him that i cannot do business
 main khilaadi hum or koi or kaam nahin jaanata
 i explained to the mother that if the younger brother was killed in an accident in front of the house, then death could come anywhere
 aakhir main maa maan gayi
 Now i have to become a world champion for my mother too
 is avasar par group aaf dilli superbaikers ke 30 bikers ne circuit par apni racing kaa kamaal bhi dikhaaya
 He also got a chance to talk to Keenan and Foret
 ye donon resar antarrashtriya racing team kaa hissaa hone ke kaaran yahaan abhyaas nahin kar sakate the
 Forret said, 'apart from meeting the enthusiastic youth associated with superbikes, we also got to know about the Buddha International Circuit
 hamane is circuit ke bare main kaaphi kuch suna tha
 Experience here will benefit us further
 ‘ vishwa superbike kaa 15waan charan buddha international circuit par hi hoga

 karol baag ke 150 hotel band ho gaye hai
 The hotels in Karol Bagh have a total of five and a half thousand rooms and there are five thousand people associated with the hotel business
 in hotalon main kareeb 12000 tourist har maah rukate hai
 The closure of hotels has created an employment crisis for the employees working in them
 karol baag ke ek hotel main aag lagane ke baad is ilaake ke kareeb dedh sau hotalon ko band kar diya gaya he
 While the closure of these hotels is affecting the employment of thousands of people, the travelers coming to Delhi are also suffering
 hotalon main pehle se booking karaane vaale logon ko ab cameraa nahin mil rahaa he
 There are disputes about this
 ek hotel main manager or graahak bahes karte hue dikhaai die
 People of Rakesh's family had made a booking in the hotel, but suddenly the doors of the hotel were closed for tourists by putting a board of maintenance outside the hotel
 hotel maalik or graahak donon pareshaan hai
 One person said that they had made the booking
 mumbai se log aae hai
 Where to take it now? All hotels are closed and five star charges are high
 ek hotel ke manager murali ne bataaya ki abhi fire department ne saare hotel band kara die hai
 Water is not coming
 isiilie hotel philhal band kar diya he
 Jitendra Joshi has also closed his hotel in Karol Bagh
 unka staff khaali baitha he or counter par sannata pasra he
 The Fire Department has instructed to keep the hotel closed until a separate tank of five thousand liters is installed
 jitendra joshi ne kaha ki hamaare paas das hajaar litre kaa tanks he lekin ab kaha ja rahaa he ki paanch hajaar kaa alag se tanks rakho
 Karol Bagh has about 250 to 300 hotels where 12000 tourists stay every month

 But we do not want to be harassed
 karol baag ke hotel arpit main aag lagane se 17 logon kii jaan chali gai lekin teen jaanch ke baad bhi laaparvaah sarkari adhikariyon par ab tak koi karrwai nahin hui
 In Karol Bagh, if the licenses of one and a half hotels out of two hundred and fifty hotels were suspended, then you can think that the Fire Department and the Municipal Corporation officials are taking reckless carelessness
 jaanch to kai huin lekin har baar kii tarah jimmedaari kisi bhi adhikari kii nahin he
 Arvind Kejriwal says that the Lokpal bill passed in Parliament is not of the ruling party but of Sonia and Rahul in the party
 yah bill bhrashtachariyon ko badhaava dene vaali he or aam janata ke liye khatarnaak he isliye ham is bill kaa virodh karte hai or ise khaarij karte hai
 Kejriwal said that the CBI did not put it in the bill, it would benefit leaders like Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh

 When the CBI fell behind Lalu Prasad, he took help from the government and the government removed the CBI

 Arvind Kejriwal said that according to the provisions of this Lokpal Bill, older people will be saved by stealing, while common people will suffer more
 unhone kaha ki agar raja chori karata he, to pehle usase yah poocha jayega ki usapar exiaar darj kyon na kiya jaae
 On the other hand, a common man is booked on the crime without first asking him anything
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar sibiai ko apane shikanje se baahar aane nahin dena chaahati he
 He alleged that the government misuses the CBI
 unhone sanjeeda swar main kaha ki is desh main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon kaa katl kar diya jaataa he

 notice main unase dilli bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ke khilaaf 'apusht' aarope lagane ke bare main jawaab-talab kiya gaya he
 The Election Commission said that a complaint has been received from Upadhyay, stating that Kejriwal has made wrong, baseless and unconfirmed allegations against him and Delhi Pradesh General Secretary of BJP Ashish Sood
 'bijli companiyon se satish upaadhyaay ke santhganth'ayog ne kaha ki is maamle main use dilli ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari dwaara bhi ek report mili he

 The Survey of India will soon 're-measure' the height of Mount Everest
 darasal, surveykshan vibhaag yah pataa lagaana chahta he ki nepal main do saal pehle aae bhayankar bukamp ke baad vishwa kii sabase oonchi chotii kii oonchai vastav main kam hui he yaa nahin
 a team from the Survey of India will leave for Nepal in two months for this expedition
 yah abhiyaan aise samay chalaaya ja rahaa he jab mount everest kii unchai ko lekar vaigyanik samudaay kii ore se shankaaen vyakt kii gai hai

 "we are sending an expedition to Mount Everest," he said
 everest kii oonchai kii ghoshnaa, agar main galat nahin hum to 1855 main kii gai thi
 Its height was measured by many but the measurement of the Survey of India is still considered the right height
 bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag ke anusaar everest kii oonchai 29,028 foot he, ham ise dobaaraa naapane ja rahe hai
 He said that there was a severe earthquake in Nepal two years ago, since then the scientific community suspects that Everest is shrinking, this is one reason for measuring again
 iske alaava doosraa kaaran yah he ki yah vaigyanik adhyayan or plate kii gati ko samajhane main sahaayta karata he
 Rao said on the sidelines of a program that the necessary approvals for this have been received and the campaign will begin in a month
 tippaniyan He said that this time there are plans to measure the height of Mount Everest using two methods 'global Positioning System' (GPS) and a ground method
 (inputs bhashaa se) Surveyor General of the Survey of India Swarna Subba Rao said that necessary approvals have been taken for this project and this will also help in future scientific studies

 The elevation of Everest was announced in 1855, if i am not mistaken
 kaiyon ke dwaara isaki unchai naapi gai lekin bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag kii maap ko aaj bhi sahi unchain mana jaataa he
 According to the Survey of India, the height of Everest is 29,028 feet, we are going to measure it again
 unhone kaha ki nepal main do saal pehle bheeshan bukamp aayaa tha, iske baad se hi vaigyanik samudaay ko shaq he ki everest sikud rahaa he, dobaaraa naap karaane kaa yah ek kaaran he
 Apart from this, another reason is that it helps in scientific study and understanding of the motion of the plate
 raav ne ek kaarykram se itar kaha ki iske liye aavashyak manjuuri mil chuki he or yah abhiyaan ek maah main shuru ho jayega
 The comments unhone kaha ki is baar mount everest kii oonchai do tareekon ‘global pojishning system’ (jeepies) or ek jamini paddati se naapane kii yojana he

 After winning the Lok Sabha elections, now in the second term, the BJP is also trying to strengthen itself in the Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main prachand bahumat hasil kar satta main ai bijepi ke paas philhal rajyasabha main bahumat kaa aankada nahin he jiske chalate pichley kaarykaal main teen talaak jaisaa ahm vidheyak kai koshishon ke baad bhi sadan se paarit nahin ho sakaa
 But now 4 Rajya Sabha mps of TDP have joined BJP which will strengthen the ruling camp in the Upper House
 tidipi ke paas rajyasabha main philhal 6 saansad hai lekin uske 4 saansadon ne bijepi kaa haath tham liya he
 With this, the opposition TDP has reduced to a party of just 2 mps, while BJP mps have increased from 71 to 75
 tidipi ke siem ramesh, tiji ventkesh, ji mohan raav or wies choudhary bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai or 6 main 4 saansadon ke tuutane par dal-badalu kanoon bhi lagu nahin rahegaa, jisase in saansadon kii sadsyta barkaraar rahegi
 The Rajya Sabha consists of a total of 245 members
 endie ke paas abhi 100 sadsy hai
 The NDA would need more than 123 mps for a majority
 yani 23 saansadon kii kami he
 The Congress now has just 48 mps in the Rajya Sabha while the TMC has 13 mps
 aise main tidipi saansadon ke bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad bijepi ko bahumat ke liye sirf 19 saansadon kii jarurat rah jaaegi
 Right now the status of NDA seats in Rajya Sabha BJP- 71 AIADMK- 13 JDU- 06 Akali Dal- 03 Shiv Sena- 03 Nominated- 03 RPI- Nearing majority by 3 years, elections are going to be held in 3 Rajya Sabha seats of Bihar and Gujarat this year which are Ravi Shankar Prasad, Amit Shah and Smriti Irani
 Are vacated after victory
 in teenon siton par bijepi kaa jeetna tay he
 After this, elections will be held in 10 Rajya Sabha seats of UP next year, in which the BJP can win the majority
 inamen se 9 siten abhi vipakshi dalon ke paas hai jisamen se 6 sapa, 2 basapa or 1 congress ke paas he
 On one hand the BJP has become stronger due to the change of TDP mps and on the other hand the opposition camp has become weak
 rajyasabha main bijepi ab bahumat ke aankade ke or kareeb ja pahunchi he
 Parties like BJD and YSRCP stand with the government in the house
 iske alaava kuch dal kisi bhi kheme main na aakar sadan se walkout kar sarkaar ko hi phayda pahunchane kaa kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, after Lok Sabha, the BJP is becoming stronger in Rajya Sabha
 apane drudh nishchay, saahas or nirnay lene kii adbhut kshamta ke kaaran indira gandhi ko vishwa raajnneeti main louh mahila ke rup main janaa jaataa he lekin kam logon ko maaloom hoga ki bachapan main unhen aam bacchon kii tarah andhere se kaaphi dar lagata tha
 Indira Gandhi has mentioned this in her memoir 'childhood Days'
 unhone likhaa he ki mujhe andhere se dar lagata tha, jaisaa ki shaayad prayek chote bachche ko lagata he
 The journey from the lower floor dining room to the upper floor bedroom alone in the evening terrified me
 lambe, faile hue baraamde ko paar karnaa, charmarati hui lakdi kii sidhiyon par chadhana or ek stool par chadhakar daravaaje ke handls or batti ke switch tak pahunchnaa
 He has written that if i had spoken about my fear to someone, then i am confident that someone would come up with me or see if the light is burning or not, but even at that age, courage had such importance that i decided that i had to get rid of this fear of loneliness on my own
 purv videsh mantri evam varisht netaa natwar singh ne kaha ki mata kii kharaab sehat or pita kii vyastata ke kaaran unka bachapan saamaanya bacchon kii tarah nahin beetaa lekin pita jawahar laal nehru kaa unpar gaharaa prabhaav tha
 Nehru also guided his daughter on every path
 pita kaa patr putree ke naam iskaa jeevant udhaaharan he
 Indira has also accepted this
 unhone likhaa he ki mere dada parivaar ke mukhiya the, isliye nahin ki vah umr main sabase bade the balki isliye kyonki unka vyaktitv bahut prabhaavshaalee tha lekin meri choti si duniya ke kendrabindu main mere pita the
 i loved, admired and respected him
 vahi ekmaatr vyakti the jinke paas mere antahin prashnon ko gambhirtha se sunne kaa samay hota tha
 It was he who awakened my interest in things around me and gave direction to my ideology
 indira ko khilaunon kaa zyada shauk nahin tha
 Initially my favorite toy was a bear that reminds me of the old saying that one can die with kindness because of love i bathed it and imposing new and expensive French cream on my aunt's face Had given
 apni ruaansi ho ai antee se daant khaane ke alaava mere sundar bhaaluu ke bal hameshaa ke liye kharaab ho gaye
 Indira Gandhi realized the anxious state of slave India as a child, she realized how important freedom was
 singh ne bataaya ki indira ne baalpan main ham umr bacchon or mitron ke sahyog se ‘vanar sena’ kaa gathan kiya tha
 He inherited the understanding of politics, due to which he soon entered politics

 supreme court maharashtra sarkaar kii dahi handi ke maamle main daakhil arji par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The state government had requested the Supreme Court to give clarity in the 2014 orders, allowing children up to 12 years of age to participate in Dahi Handi and also stayed the High Court's order to limit the height of 20 feet
 Was given sarkaar kaa kahana he ki kya ye aadesh ek saal ke liye the yaa abhi bhi lagu hai? ASG Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, told the Supreme Court that on August 11, 2014, the Bombay High Court had said in its order that youth below 18 years of age cannot participate in Dahi Handi and its height is not more than 20 feet
 Should be aayojakon ne supreme court main apil kii thi or supreme court ne hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue 12 saal tak ke bacchon ko hissaa lene kii ijaajat de di thi or oonchai ke aadesh par bhi roak laga di thi
 But later the Supreme Court disposed of this petition
 ASG ke mutabik, ab hoicourt is maamle main adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa maamla maanate hue sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court should clarify about its order that after all this exemption was only for the same year or will continue to apply

 salmaan khan ne yah kehete hue apane rukh kaa bachaav kiya ki vah sirf ek stand le rahe the, kisi kaa paksh nahin le rahe the
 Salman said in an interview, 'I didn't want to do Bigg Boss 8 because it is very tiring

 In such a situation, the elected government which works against the Constitution can be removed and removed

 Shanti Bhushan surrounded the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal and said these 5 big things from the platform of Swaraj India
 1
 Arvind Kejriwal, who spoke about Swaraj, has over swaraj under the guise of majority
 2
 Arvind Kejriwal was made CM of Delhi by the people of Delhi and his mind has deteriorated by winning 67 seats
 3
 Arvind Kejriwal has made Worst City (the worst) instead of making Delhi Corworld class city
 4
 Kejriwal should have worked closely with the Center but started quarreling so that he could become Prime Minister in 2019
 5
 Because of its wrong attitude, the Aam Aadmi Party is winning neither in Goa nor in Punjab

 kuch aisa hi haal tha rima lagu kaa
 In many films, Reema Lagoo played different roles, but in reality, her mother's character was very much fixed on her and it seemed as if she was a mother
 rima ne kai abhinaytaon kii maa kaa role kiya, lekin sanjay dutt or salmaan khan ke saath unki chemistry kuch alag hi thi
 Perhaps this is the reason why after the death of Reema Lagoo, Sanjay Dutt said that he had lost another mother
 rima ke nidhan ke baad sanjay dutt ne ek bayaan jari karte hue kaha- "maine ek baar phir apni maa ko khoyaa he
 i did many films with him and learned a lot whenever i worked with him
 unki kami ko puraa karnaa mushkil he
 May his soul rest in peace and his family have patience and courage
