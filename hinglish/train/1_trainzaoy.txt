 The Aam Aadmi Party is seen citing daily news to surround the Modi government on the issue of demonetisation
 shuukravaar ko bhi aisa hi kuch hua jab 'aap' netaa ashish khetaan ne shuukravaar ko press conference ke dauraan 2 vajah bataate hue aarope lagaaya ki notebandi ke elaan kii jaankaree pehle se li ho chuki thi
 1
 siem arvind kejariwal ne notebandi ke baad 12 november ko bataaya tha ki isi saal sitambar maheene main kai bainkon main 4 lakh karod rupee jamaa kiye gaye jo kalaadhan he
 In response, the Finance Minister argued that all that money was the effect of the payment of 45 thousand crores made under the 7th Pay Commission
 lekin ek akhbaar ke khulaase ke mutabik sitambar maheene main sarkari bainkon main jamaa hui raashi main se 3 lakh karod rupee kii raashi to sirf 15 sitambar se 30 sitambar ke bich fiks diposit (FD) ke madhyam se jamaa karai gai thi or inhen oktober ke maheene main tudwa diya gaya tha
 2
 iske alaava state bank of india ke chif iconomik adwiser soumyakanti ghosh ne isi saal ke march maheene main esbiai kii jari hui ek report main likhaa tha ki bahut jald puraane note band kar die jaaenge, jiske chalate kuch log apane kaledhan ko yaa to gold yaa phir dollar main tabdeel karne lage
 After these 2 facts, that claim of the Prime Minister proves to be false under which PM Modi was terming the decision of demonetisation as the top secret
 aam aadmi party ne sarkaar kii nitiyon par sawaal uthaate hue poocha he ki jo khate main dhai lakh rupee jamaa karata he to uske paas notice bhej kar uske ghar yaa dukaan par red maari ja rahi he or duusari taraf ghar kii mahilaon ne apni almaari main kitne aabhushan rakhen hai is par sarkaar najar rakh rahi he
 But on the other hand, just before demonetisation, 4 lakh crore rupees are deposited in banks and it is made white, so why is the government not ready to investigate it? grih mantri rajnath singh ne shanivaar ko bharat pakistan seemaa par barmer ke munaabaav seemaa chaowkee par seemaa suraksha bal ke jawaano ko sambodhit karte hue pakistan ko chetavanee di ki bharat kabhi kisi par akraman nahin karata

 ajtak ke 'oparation aam aadmi' main aapane dekha ki kaise dilli ke tamaam sarkari mahakamon main rishwatakhori kaa dhandha dhadlle se chal rahaa he
 It immediately had the effect that three officers were suspended and a case was registered against them
 lekin ajtak kaa asar duusare din dekhne ko mila
 In all government offices, officials are scared of bribes
 'oparation aam aadmi part 2' main dekhie ki kaise adhikari behad dare-sahame hue hai
 When the Aam Aadmi Party, which fought the corruption war, came to power, it seemed that the game of bribery in Delhi was over
 arvind kejariwal ke aane ke baad dilli kii rishwatkhor naukarshahi shaayad AAP ke aage ghutane tech degi
 But when the intelligence team of Aaj Tak came out in the offices of Delhi to do a reality test of the bribe, the camera was also shocked
 ji haa, bangaroo lakshmana style main teble ke upar paisa lete adhikari jab hare-hare note apane daraajon main sahejkar rakhane lage, to dilli kaa khulaa khel sabake saamne tha
 On Monday night, when Aaj Tak showed in Operation Aam Aadmi how the business of corruption is going on in Delhi offices, the government was also stunned at first
 lekin kuch der sanbhalkar kejariwal ne jab maukey kii najaakat ko samajha, to AAP kii sarkaar ne ajtak par hi rishwatakhori ke khilaaf jang kaa elaan kar diya
 Manish Sisodia's attitude was worth watching
 udhar arvind kejariwal ne apane daftar main ratorat dilli ke afasaron ko talab kiya or unhen hukum diya ki camere par dikh rahe ghoosekhor adhikariyon or baabuon ko turant suspend kiya jaae
 Not only this, Kejriwal also issued immediate orders for transfer of 800 employees of Delhi Jal Board
 kejariwal ke ghar se lekar mukhyamantri daftar tak hadakamp much chukaa tha
 By morning, Kejriwal took out another arrow from his quiver
 anti karpshan beuro se kaha ki wo bina vakt jaaya kiye camere par rishwat lete adhikariyon par mukadmaa darj kare
 Actually, Kejriwal considers corruption as the trump card of his government
 lihaaja yah baaji wo apane haath se nikalne dena nahin chaahate
 Here, Aaj Tak's team knocked on Delhi offices again on Tuesday to do another reality test of bribery
 ise ajtak kaa asar kahen yaa kejariwal kaa kahar, mangalvaar kii subah dilli ke daftaron main bhrashtachar ko saanp soongh gaya tha
 Aaj Tak's intelligence team reached the Employment Exchange Office at RK Puram on Tuesday
 vahaan apana naam pehle hi registration karaane ke liye daftar ke babu se kaha, to ajtak ke sting oparation kaa asar uski jubaan or chehre par saaf-saaf padhaa ja saktaa tha
 The official of the Employment Exchange Office said, 'you have not got a job, why are you bent on taking my job? teen-teen afasaron ko naap diya kejariwal ne
 
 'ajtak kii team dilli jal board ke us daftar main bhi pahunchi, jiske ek adhikari rishwat kii moti rakam lete hue hamaare khufia camere main kaid ho gaye the
 But now the view has changed
 vahaan bhi yahi duhai ki teen-teen nap gaye, ab to rishwatakhori se tauba hi tauba
 
 
 Which RTO would be like this, where the brokers outside the office do not meet you
 lekin mangalvaar ko ajtak kii khufia team jab saket ke artio ke baahar pahunchi, to badale maahaul kii duhai vahaan baitha dukandaar hi karne laga
 The shopkeeper told Aajtak that after Monday's incident, Aajtak's news had such an effect that it is now a sweep on corruption
 artio ke baahar dukandaar ne kabuula, 'yahaan se gaayab ho gaye saare dalal
 Corruption swept here
 anti karpshan branch kaa haalchaal
 
 
 The reality test was not only taken in the offices of the Delhi government, but also the Anti Corruption Branch which investigated corruption in Delhi
 dilli main police kaa anti karpshan branch ek aisa mahakama he, jahaan ab tak filein dhul phaankati thim or zyaadaatar adhikari bagaiyr kaam ke baithe rahete the
 But the effect of Operation Aam Aadmi showed that a lawsuit was filed against the suspended officers in this branch
 uske ek bade adhikari ne ajtak ke 'oparation aam aadmi part 2' main yah kabool kiya ki kaise branch alert ho gaya he or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf din raat kaam shuru hone ja rahaa he
 The headquarters of the Anti Corruption Branch is near the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 dilli sarkaar kaa wo daftar, jahaan bhrashtachar kii har file kholi, parkhi or janchi jaati he
 The prosecution of officers caught in Operation Aam Admi has also been registered in this branch
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf paardarshita laane ke liye ajtak ke andercover reporter is daftar main bhi khufia camere ke saath andar pahunche
 Hear the next story from Balwant Singh, ACC of Anti Corruption Bureau
 
 
 unhone kaha, 'ham is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 We are a growing team of people
 sidi he, isamen log arest honge
 On the arrival of the AAP government in Delhi, Balwant Singh said that nobody used to take care of this office before Kejriwal
 lekin kejariwal ke aane ke baad yahaan afasaron kii tainaati bhi ho rahi he
 Now ACP will work both day and night
 dilli ke dil ko kabhi-kabhi jaananaa vaaki mushkil he
 On the one hand, there is a stir among the officers from the operation of the common man, on the other hand there are some of the activities of the Delhi government, where even after Kejriwal's announcement, the corrupt people will not get lice on their ears
 dilli sarkaar ke sabase bade aspataalon main se ek he guru teg bahadur aspataal
 There is still a crowd of brokers to admit the patient here
 bina paise die yahaan sui lagavane main bhi dikkat aa sakati he
 Things are changing now
 lekin abhi bhrashtachar mukt dilli ke liye lanbaa safar tay karnaa hoga
 Kejriwal also knows it well, that is why through the call center, you are giving you a chance to join the campaign against corruption

 In fact, just a few days ago Shivpal Yadav had asked Akhilesh Yadav to fulfill his promise to make Mulayam the national president, about which Akhilesh Yadav was questioned by a journalist
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav aaj apane chachaa shivpal singh yadav ke party kii kaman sapa sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav ko saunpane sambandhi bayaan ko lekar sawaal poochne vaale ek patrkaar par bhadak gaye
 It happened that when a senior correspondent of a TV channel asked a question about Shivpal's statement, Akhilesh took the name of the reporter wearing a light saffron-colored shirt and said, "he has just arrived
" inkaa rang bhi thodaa bhagava tip kaa he
 With this i will tell all journalists to decide on one day in May

 Akhilesh's press conference was to be held at one o'clock, but it started about a quarter of an hour late
 is dauraan mediakarmiyon ko dhoop main khadey rahanaa padaa
 The comments jab mediakarmi sabhakaksh main pahunche to akhilesh ne kaha- aaj press conference nahin hogi
 We wanted to talk to you tomorrow

 Later, a security guard standing outside the hall pushed a senior journalist to remove him from the front of the gate

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The reporter had asked the SP president that senior members of the party and his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav are repeatedly making statements that Akhilesh had promised before the last assembly election that he would retain all the rights of the party president as well as his post after the election
 The father will hand over the party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and hence he should return to the post of president

 During this time, the media persons had to stand in the sun

 Indeed, there is a danger of suspension of some star players before they go a long way to the final
 jin khilaadiyon par nilamban kaa khatra he unamem argetina ke leonal mesi, portugal ke christiano ronaldo or brazil ke nemaar jaise star khilaadiyon ke naam shaamil hai
 What is fifa's rule? According to FIFA World Cup tournament rules - "if players are shown two yellow cards before the quarter-finals, they will be suspended for the next one match
 yadiquarter finelake baad ve referi dwaara duusari baar book paae jate hai to unhen semifinal se nilambit kar diya jayega
 This means that no player will want to go to the semi-finals with the threat of suspension, which suspends them from the final match itself
 news agency ieenes ke mutabik, "argetina ke star khilaadi leonal mesi ko group match main nigeria ke khilaaf aakhri minuton main samay barbaad karne ko lekar yelo card dikhaaya gaya tha
 In addition to Messi, five other Argentine players have received yellow cards
 mesi ko ab agar nokout main france ke khilaaf bhi yelo card miltaa he to unhen quarter final main portugal ke khilaaf baahar baithna pad saktaa he
 However this will only happen when both teams reach the next round
 or bhi khilaadiyon ke naam Nature made this paradise with great leisure
 ise pahaado, darkhton or jharanon se sajaayaa tha
 But the people of the border across the border have set their eyes on this paradise
 ise jahannam banane ke liye wo us paar se kabhi bam, kabhi barood, kabhi jallaad bheja karte the
 But even when he could not see this beauty
 to ab unhone us paar se powder, tablet or injection bhejne shuru kar die taaki is jananath ke zarre zarre ko wo cancer kii tarah wo is jananath ke bashindon ko apane nashe ke jaal main jakad len
 When the heart is in the same state
 jab uske bina ek lamhaa bhi qayaamat lagane lage
 When his addiction becomes life
 jab wo naa ho to maut nazar aae
 as when
 
 
 jab aisa to samaj lijie aap nashe main hai
 The intoxication of the pale blue zamzam
 madhoshi ek ek karke karine kii tarah pahaado par sajaae gaye in darkhton kii
 These victims floating on water
 jangalon par saaya kiye hue in chinaaron kii
 Just
 
 Stay here
 
 Stop
 aage naa badhie
 Because the surur who gives comfort to Ruh
 madhoshi or nashe kaa ahsaas bas yaheen tak he
 Next to this, the door of Jahannam opens in many places
 jahaan se jahrili hawaaen aati hai
 But who mixed the air of Jahannam in this paradise
 koun hai wo jo is firdaus se farramoshi kar rahaa he
 If Firdaus bar-ru-e-zameen Asthammi Ast o Hamin Ast o Hamin is to see Jannat on the ground itself, that is it
 yani ise zamin kaa jananath kaha gaya he
 But there is another intoxication of this paradise
 pehle punjab or ab jammu kashmir
 The consignment of drugs coming from Pakistan across the border has now started poisoning the people
 naujavaanon ke saath-saath mahilaayein bhi nashe kii aadi ho rahi hai
 The question is that before the situation is completely out of order, can Jammu and Kashmir be saved from ruin? How dangerous is the situation in the Jammu and Kashmir state surrounded by beautiful plains and mountains, only by reaching Ground Zero Can be understood saikadon log nashe ke shikaar hai
 And a large part of this drug is smuggled from Pakistan and brought here
 jammu-kashmir kii ye chaunkaanewaali haqiqat kaa pataa karne ke liye ajtak kii team rajdhani dilli se chah sau kilometre dur is pahari kasbe udhampur aa pahunchi he
 Amidst the crowded markets, dense settlements and residential areas, we want to recount how the drugs are finally making people sick
 mahaz 23 saal ke ek ladke kii kahani bhi hairaan karne vaali he
 Would you believe that the boy is addicted to dangerous drugs like heroin and is now trying to get out of the drug trap? The story of this young man is restless in itself
 par ye bechaini tab or bad jaati he, jab aapako pataa chalata he ki is noujvaan kaa bada bhai bhi pichley das saalon se nashe kii zad main hai
 Many people have been taking drugs there for years
 ye nasha dilo-dimaag par kaise or kis tarah haaavee hota he, ye bas isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki wo nashe kii ek choti si khuraaq ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar rahata he
 To any extent means to any extent! According to him, he also tried to come out of it, but drug peddlers roaming in the vicinity, drug dealers do not let him do so
 wo apane nashe kii is aadat se pareshaan to he, lekin khud apane or apane jaise dusron kii is pareshaani ko dekhte hue hamase baat karne ko taiyaar ho jaataa he
 But with the condition that we will not allow his identity to be revealed
 wo kahata he ki use samaaj main apni beizzati kaa bhi dar he or nashe ke saudagaron se khatara bhi he
 But here it is not only a few people, but the whole family
 nashe kii beemaari ne jammu-kashmir main kai pariwaron ko barbaad kar diya he
 Now know about a father
 ek baar nashe kii chapet main aane ke baad isse baahar nikalnaa kitna mushkil he, ye inase behatar shaayad hi koi bataa saktaa he
 He tried to get help from the doctors in order to overcome drug addiction, but the treatment did not produce any special result, instead, the income of a lifetime went to drugs
 70 lakh rupee se zyaada kaa family bijnes tabah ho gaya

 'nach baliye (nach Baliye 9)' nityami shirke kii is haalat se ubar paata isse pehle hi sho ke duusare contestant anita hasanandani ke pati rohit reddy biimaar pad gaye
 Seeing the constant troubles on the show, the other producers of the show including Salman Khan thought of a solution
 iske tahat salmaan khan or baaki nirmaataaon ne 'nach baliye 9 (nach Baliye 9)' main quran sharif kaa paath karavaaya
 According to a Spotboy
com report, the makers had invited the children of Madrasas to recite Quran Sharif on the sets of 'nach Baliye 9'
 reports ke mutabik set se sabhi buree chizonko dur karne ke liye madrase ke bacchon ko set par laayaa gaya
 The makers made this decision to make the journey of contestants on the show easier and to overcome the troubles of contestants
 bataa den ki star plus par aane vaale'nach baliye (nach Baliye 9)' ke produsrasalmaan khan hai
 This time the concept of the show is completely different
 sho main is baar 5 eks jodiyon or paanch maujuuda jodiyon ke dilachasp concept ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The launch of the program itself has raised its level
 'nach baliye 9' ko ravina tandon jaj karti najar aa rahi hai
 Every week there is definitely a big bang on the show's set

 aaj adaalat main cese kii sunwaayee ke vakt nila salwar-suut pahane ek baees-taees kii maasoom ladki ko bandookdhaari pulisiyon ke bich aate dekha to chaunkaa
 But the real shocking night was to be in his office
 cabin main ghuste hi ek aadmi ko uske saamne baithe dekha
 It was known that she has been making long inquiries with some people related to the case, and did not know why it was one of them, the same man with whom i had spoken on the phone
 yah khyaal aate hi ki yah vah ho saktaa he, thodaa asahaj ho gaya
 One of the reasons for being uncomfortable is that it was thought that at this time he would be able to talk freely about the case
 - baithiye na
 
 batalaaiye kya kah rahe the aap court main
 i pointed at the man, he understood my reluctance
 khud hi cese-sambandhit baat shuru kar di, mujhe sanket diya ki main us aadmi kii phikr na karun
 We kept opening
 naksal masale par batiyate rahe ki pulisavaale kis bhay main ji rahe hai, jaraa sa chook bas katar diye jaayenge
 There was also talk about the investigation of the suspect who i thought was the person sitting next to me for a long time
 usase kya poochtacha ho chuki he, kya abhi baaki he
 What is left in hand, what is left apane bare main batalaaya
 This is his first case in the police recently

 On the wall of the cabin was hanged the chart of crime records, also a large map of the district which had many red, green marks
 bolte vakt uski ungaliyon main fansaa pen ghumta rahata
 Sometimes the pen used to stare at the glass
 main bhul gaya koi bagal main baitha hua he, bich main atapata sa lagata jab masalaa thodaa adhik khufia ho jaataa ki koi hamen sun rahaa he
 But in the moment i would be carefree, what is it when i am not taking care of this man? pulisavaala hi koi hoga jarur
 - You sit, the bus comes in two minutes
 ab vah aadmi or main - us cabin main
 His eye was bent, perhaps gazing at the point of his shoes
 phir vahi keedaa naachne-nonchne laga
 Is this the one who spoke on the phone that day, which this girl cross-interrogates? Secretly added his number to the mobile

 xxrep 7 - phute kam, toote zyada kisi aspataal kaa oktober jisamen ek kathith naksali bhartee he
 As it is the most Naxal-affected state in the country, ten districts out of eighteen are Naxalite strongholds, their presence in many other districts as well, more than thirty-six percent of the country's deaths due to Naxal-violence occurred in this state, so obviously bizarre Words fly in the air
 yah baccha masalan jo police ghere ko cheerata aspataal main ghusaa chalaa aayaa he
 Ten years old, everyone ignored and he came in the ward and stood next to the bed of that 'naxalite'
 achaanak kisi sipaahi kaa dhyaan jaataa he, shart-nekar pahane yah koun he

 Somebody strongly believes' Naxalites are found only at night
 'isaki ek vajah yah bhi ki bengal or andhra pradesh main jahaan naksal andolan ko madhyavargeey or shahari samarthan rahaa he, is pradesh main lagbhag nahin
 His presence at the Jadavpur University and the College of Andhra Pradesh has been strong, with no participation in any student union here even after ten years of violence, except for a few exceptions that are concentrated in the jungle, hills and villages
 isaki ek badi vajah naksaliyon kaa is pradesh main bengal se bhinn jaivikeey vidhaan or khud is pradesh kaa vishisht snaayu tantra bhi he
 This also proves that Naxal is not a homogenous or single-faced suffix

 Smell of trees, blinding color of soil - just missing inside a step

 But there is nothing left to come here

 The action was to return

 Here one may fearlessly enter into intercourse with his death or novel
 mrityu- koi aakasmik durghatana nahin ekadam sajag, chaukanni maut- or upanyaas lekhan ke tatv mimasiy tantu ek hi to hai
 Leaving everything behind, the whole business of life is spent writing a novel, and death also brings the entire bookkeeping in disguise to the old scribe, pressed in the umbrella like a novel
 magahar main marane par nark yaa kaashi main jane se swarg miltaa tha yaa he yaa nahin, abujhmaad main saans chhodane par agle janm main upanyaaskaar ho jane, nahin to ek-aadh upanyaas likh le jane kii sambhaavna jarur banati he
 The novel's skin-touching creator struggles with awe, desolation-murdini-fear of death, recovering from them in rare moments, walking in Abujhmad, passing through the night and morning and afternoon
 Be aware of the fear that even more fearful than seeing a completely unfamiliar dress, a bullet coming from a gun lying behind a tree can break your skull
 lekin tum aage badhate jate ho, bhul jate ho, ve sabhi hidaayaten jo yahaan aane se pehle kai martabaa di gayi thim
 The unbearable terror of blank white paper is dreadful and dangerous than the fear of death
 apni aukaat, tucchapan ughad jane kaa aatank
 That's why you have no fear this night
 khauf ko kuchalate ye aakhir wo lamhe hai jab yaa to shabd yaa phir aaye to aa jaye maut
 No one else is right, Abuzhmad will be a witness

 (courtesy of narrator-journalist Ashutosh Bhardwaj's diary from Jankipul) varanasi se haare hue modi ko dilli main koi pradhanmantri nahin banayega
 The audience's acceptance of this argument by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi on 15 April was evidence that this party was not threatening to win nationally, except winning 28 seats in Delhi Assembly Has succeeded in making it realize
 party ke think tanks maane jane vaale 50 varshiya yogendra yadav ke mutabik, ‘‘prayaas karnaa, galtiyaan karnaa, prachaar ke dauraan maukey ke anuroop jodpha-ghataana or galtiyaan sudhaarte janaa’’ hi aap ke chunaav abhiyaan kaa moolmantra rahaa he
 Thanks to this mantra, the party that has come into existence recently has achieved the national form
 yahaan tak ki 434 loksabhaa siton par ummidavaar khadey kar isane is maamle main donon pramukh partiyon-rahul gandhi kii congress or narendra modi kii bijepi ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 AAP spokesperson and Lok Sabha candidate from Gurgaon while campaigning for the last phase of elections in Amethi, taking leave from Delhi's Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said, "I don't think anyone dreamed Will this party reach here? ’’aktubar, 2013 main aap kii rajnatik maamalon kii samiti (piesi) dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke abhiyaan par kaam kar rahi thi
 At that time, there was an occasional discussion about the 2014 elections
 un charchaaon main amuman 15-20 mahatvapurn loksabhaa kshetron main hi aap kaa ummidavaar utaarne kii baat hoti thi
 But a few hours in the evening of 8 December 2013 changed the party's destiny and intentions
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke aakhri nattejey ghoshit hue or apane pehle hi chunaav main rajdhani kii 28 siten apni jholii main daalane vaali aap ke liye deshbhar se samarthan kii bauchhaar hone lagi
 And its founder Kejriwal suddenly emerged as a "winner" from a "challenger"
 iske baad kejariwal ne 28 disambar ko alpamat sarkaar ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee, jise congress kaa ‘‘bina shart’’ samarthan mil chukaa tha
 Overnight as soon as the government was formed, Aam Aadmi Party units also became places where the party had never reached
 yadav bataate hai, ‘‘kerala, tamilnadu or mysore jaisi jagahon se bhi hamen kol aane lageen
 We had no idea that our supporters are also present there
 ’’aap ne 23 disambar, 2013 ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye daavedaaron se online aavedan mangavaaye
 More than 10,000 people applied for tickets
 phir janvari kii shuruyaat main party ne 20 dinon tak ‘‘main bhi aam aadmi’’ abhiyaan ke jariye lagbhag 1 karod sadsy party se jod liye

 In the first Lok Sabha election held in 1951, Congress candidate Damodaran won from here
 iske baad 57 or 62 main bhi congress ke paas yah seat rahi
 In 1967, DMK wrested this seat from Congress for the first time
 iske baad 1971 ke aam chunaav or 1971 main hi hue upachunaav main bhi yah seat diemke ke paas hi rahi
 AIADMK captured this seat for the first time in the elections held in 1977
 lekin 80 ke chunaav main diemke ne yah seat ediemke se chin lee
 But after that, in the elections of 84, 89 and 91, the AIADMK won the seat
 1996 main yahaan se pehali baar tamil manila congress (mupanaar) ne jeet darj kii
 But he could not retain his seat

 Equation of Assembly seats: Pollachi Lok Sabha seat consists of six assembly seats
 ye hai- thondamuthur, kinathukadavu, polachi, vaalparai (surakshit), udumalpet or madathukulam
 Five of these seats were won by AIADMK in the 2016 assembly elections

 haalanki naikar india today samooh main kaam karnaa chaahate hai lekin unke batch ke sabhi chaatro ko jab tak kahin naukari nahin mil jaati he, ve kisi duusari company main aavedan nahin kar sakate
 Till now 85 percent of the students of IIMC, Delhi have got jobs somewhere
 chaatro ko santhaan kii ore se isi tarah kaa sahyog miltaa he
 It is the most preferred institute for students wanting to go into media
 naikar vaise to edwartiging ke chaatr rahe hai lekin ve kisi samachar samooh main bhi naukari paane kii ummid kar sakate hai kyonki yahaan chaatro ko media se sambandhit sabhi vishyon kii training di jaati he
 Geeta Bamzai, head and dean (academics) and chair of the Department of Communication Research, says, "our students are enabled to work across all media platforms — print radio, TV and digital
" unhen jan sanchaar ke sabhi kshetron main kaam karne kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he
 "last year, the students who had taken a course from IIMC, got an average of Rs 13 lakh a year
 ke package kaa prastaav mila tha
 However, the duration of the course at IIMC may change soon as the Ministry of Human Resources has issued a letter of intent to declare IIMC as a deemed university
 jab yah santhaan vishvavidhyalay kaa darja paa jayega to yah diploma kii jagah degree kii oopaadhi degaa
 The IIMC currently works under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 societes registration act 1867 ke tahat panjikrut iiemasi socity is santhaan kaa sanchaalan karti he
 After its inauguration on 17 August 1965, the institute started operations with very limited staff including two UNESCO consultants
 shuru ke varshon main santhaan kendriya soochna seva ke adhikariyon ko prashikshan dene kaa kaam karata tha
 Apart from this, it used to conduct small scale research studies
 1969 main isane africa-asian deshon ke madhyam str ke patrakaron ke liye antarrashtriya prashikshan kaarykram shuru kiya
 After this it started many special courses of short duration
 ye course ek saptaah se lekar teen maheene tak ke hote the jinka uddeshy sarkari or saarvajanik kshetra main sanchaar se jude karmchaariyon ko prashikshan dena hota tha
 IIMC now offers postgraduate diplomas in print, radio and TV journalism in various languages as well as ad and PR
 samay bitne ke saath iiemasi ne sanchaar se sambandhit adhyaapan, prashikshan or research ke kshetra main utkrushtataa ke centre ke taur par vishesh pratishtha praapt kar lee he
 It has expanded its infrastructure — it now has six centers in Delhi, Dhenkanal, Aizawl, Kottayam, Amravati and Jammu
 isane academik gatividhiyon ko bhi badhaayaa he jisamen teji se failte media or sanchaar udyog ko dhyaan main rakhkar kai tarah ke vishisht course bhi shaamil hai
 Syllabus is reviewed here annually to ensure that it remains contemporary
 new media vibhaag kii adhyaksh anubhuti yadav kahati hai, ''hamaara jor is baat par hota he ki is kshetra ke visheshgyon ko adhyaapan ke liye niyukt kiya jaae
 For example, 70% of the training industry experts in the AD&PR department offer
 santhaan main padhai ke saath hi kadi mehnat karai jaati he or chaatro ko media se sambandhit kshetron main bhi le jaaya jaataa he taaki unhen vyaavhaarik jaankaree bhi mil sake
 According to Yadav, "this is what makes this institution different from other institutions

 iskaa uddeshy chaatro ko bharat ke pracheen ateet, samayik itihaas or loktantr main uske parivartit hone se parichit karana he
 The information technology revolution has not only broadened the field of journalism but has also changed its structure
 video or soshal media ne agar patrakarita kii sambhaavnaaon ko badhaayaa he to farji khabaron ke khatre ko bhi janm diya he
 IIMC as a reputed media institute realizes this
 isiilie usne kai kaaryshaalaayein yojit kii hai jahaan yah sikhaaya gaya he ki farji khabaron ke badhate khatre se kaise nipta jaae
 Says Bamzai, "the aim of our training here is to instill a sense of responsibility in the students so that they can play a constructive role in a multilingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural society
" isi se iiemasi ke chaatr duusare sansthaanon ke chaatro se alag hote hai
 "this kind of thinking makes IIMC consistent with its philosophy that aims at how communication can become a medium to bring about change and development in society
" iske alaava bhi aap jab bhi aap changing room main jaaen to apane hisaab se un sari jagahon par gambhirtha se nirikshan karen jahaan aapako gupt camera hone kaa shaq ho

 jiesti kii maujuuda sthiti par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne safai dete hue kaha ki bade aarthik sudhaaron kii shuruyaat main khed hota he lekin koshish kar ise dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Anshuman Tiwari, editor of India Today Hindi, says that "GST revenue collection is miles away from the target and the treasury is in a shambles
" agar sarkaar shuru se hi do tex daron vaala jiesti lekar chali hoti to baat duusari thi lekin ab to jatiltaaon kaa ambara gadha ja chukaa he
 Why not the associated small business The Prime Minister claimed that GST brought a challenge for small businesses because this revolutionary structure of tax was completely technology-based
 lihaaja desh ke asangathit kaarobaar ke liye technology kaa sahaara lenaa itnaa aasaan sabit nahin hua
 In fact, before the implementation of GST, the central government had claimed that after this tax reform, the central government will get a revenue of 1 lakh crore rupees per month
 jiesti lagu hue 18 maheene biit chuke hai or prati maah jiesti tantra is jaadooi aankade ko chune main chook ja rahaa he
 Anshuman Tiwari states that “GST is now running only on the tax contributions of the major manufacturers and service providers (who were also the major taxpayers in the previous system)
 chote karadaata or nae panjikaran vaale kaarobaari riyaayaton kii madad se tex chori ke puraane dharre par laut aae hai
 "even after 18 months, the special system of GST was not launched from midnight on July 1, 2017, the four-rate (5,12,18,28 per cent) GST was implemented across the country
 lekin ise lagu karne ke baad se lekar abhi tak jiesti main darjanon badlaav kiye gaye
 In many changes, if there was an exercise to give concession to businessmen, some changes were made to reduce the burden on the common man
 lekin in kavayadon se kya kaarobaari or aam aadmi ko phayda pahunchaa? is sawaal par suspence barkaraar he
 Anshuman Tiwari states that “the prices of products or services have also come down after the concessions in GST as companies are increasing prices due to cost overruns
 jiesti ke tahat munafkhori rokane vaala tantra abhi shuru nahin hua jisase pataa chale ki riyaayaton kaa phayda kise mila he
 "tiwari said that" On an average, 60% of business returns are being paid in GST right now

 kaarobaari or upabhokta ko bada phaaydakendra sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki jiesti lagu hone se kaarobaari ko sabase bada phayda yah hoga ki use puure desh main ek samaan tex adaa karnaa padegaa
 At the same time, in doing business from one state to another, business people have to pay many types of taxes
 iske saath hi jiesti kaa sabase bada phayda upabhoktaaon ko hoga
 According to the Geist structure, the consumer is sure to get a large share of the tax benefits

 The tax department will be tight-lipped, the minister claimed that it would be an effort to make the revenue departments including the income tax department so strong
 jetali ke mutabik is vibhaagon ke kaamkaaj kaa tarika puri tarah se technology ke sahare chalegaa jahaan sendhamari kii sambhaavnaaen nahin hongi
 At the same time, due to technology, the possibility of collusion between business and tax departments will also be eliminated

 GST to be the world's best tax system The central government had claimed that GST would make the complex tax system in the area of indirect taxes very simple and transparent
 iske chalate desh kii kar vyavasta duniya kii sabase saral vyavastha banegi
 At the same time, it was also claimed that with this economic reform, India will be able to maintain its position in the fastest growing economies of the world

 In the last few years, nothing has happened in the way the cow has been highlighted in the country
 gaay kii puja karne vaale gaubhakton kii desh main kami nahin
 But the actions of self-styled cow vigilantes were also seen in recent times
 desh ke 29 main se 24 rajyon main govadh par pratibandh he
 Uttar Pradesh is also such a state where there is a provision of strict punishment on cow slaughter
 jaahir he ki kanoon kaa paalan karne ke liye gaayon par yahaan police kii bhi najar rahani chahie
 If one considers the safest and best place for the sacred cows, then that is the cow belt of the country
 is kshetra kaa bada hissaa uttar pradesh main he
 But the truth that came out from the investigation of 'india Today / Aaj Tak' taking the position of Guy in this area is astonishing
 under cover reporters ne camere se jo kaid kiya, use jaanakar aap dang rah jaaenge ki sabase surakshit maane jane vaale kshetra main hi gaay ko kaise-kaise khataron kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 How is the nefarious nexus of cowshed operators, brokers and corrupt policemen selling and selling cows and calves? a team of under-cover reporters reached the animal market in Saifni town of Rampur district in Uttar Pradesh under this mission
 yahankurabaani ke liye gaay or bachhadonko lekar khule taur par molbhav kiya ja rahaa tha
 When the under cover reporter called himself a buyer and wanted to know the price, it came to know that a cow can be bought for 16,000 to 22,000 thousand rupees
 yahaan dekhakar sabase zyada hairaani hui ki sab kuch bekhauf chal rahaa tha
 The under cover reporter told an animal vendor, 'A cow is needed for the festival
 ' is par jawaab mila- 'yahaan bazaar main ghumkar dekhie, bahut mil jaaengi
 'another animal vendor demanded Rs 17,000 for a cream colored cow
 'india today / aaj tak' team ko rampur main sirf jivit pashu hi nahin bikate dikhe
 In the beef market here, meat was also traded indiscriminately
 meet vikritaon ne ye bhi mana ki wo gomance bech rahe hai
 When the under cover reporter asked the Ekmeet shopkeeper, "do you have a cow?" To this the shopkeeper's reply was- 'yes
 ' jo meet dukandaar bech rahaa tha, uski keemat usne 160 rupye prati kilo bataai
 Another shopkeeper claimed that the police had warned all (shopkeepers) here that whatever meat hangs on the shop, its skin should be completely clean
 jisase kabhi achaanak inspection ho to kuch pakadaa naa jaae
 The behavior of the operator of a cowshed in Rampur was the most shocking
 kanha gaushala ko chalaane vaale sundar pandeya se under cover reporter ne poocha- 'tyohaar par kurabaani ke liye wo gaay kaa intjaam kaise kara saktaa he?'is par pandeya kaa jawaab tha, 'do din main wo ise tyohaar ke liye uplabdh kara degaa, abhi jo yahaan (kanha gaushala) main jo maujuuda stock he wo kurabaani ke liye feet nahin he, kuch ke sing toote hai, kuch kii taange kshatigrast hai
 You need immaculate animals to sacrifice
 ' pandey kii baton se ye bhi saaf hua ki yahaan se meet ke liye bachade ko bhi kharida ja saktaa he
 The next day the 'india Today / Aaj Tak' team reached out to a broker named Alim
 aleem ne bataaya ki yepura gorakhdhandhakaise chalata he
 Alim said, 'the police catch them (cows) and bring them to the police station
 yahaan se unhen gaushala vaale kharid kar le jate hai
 Two, three, four lakh rupees are paid according to the number and health of the animals
 ' under cover reporter ne aleem se poocha, 'gaushala vaale in gaayon kaa kya karte hai?' dalal kaa jawaab tha, 'wo apana paisa vasuulate hai

 At the same time, Pakistan's foreign policy chief Sartaj Aziz said that the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was charged with seven charges including IED attack on important installations of Pakistan and attack on Shias

 'is dauraan kadri ne kaha ki unki party ne chaar binduon kaa prastaav paas kiya he, jisamen saaf kaha gaya he ki asia bibi kii rihaai ko islam par hamalaa mana jayega

 Generally, the names of his artistic films are well received by the people after the name of Gurudutt, while he is no match in making crime thriller films and films like 'jaal' and 'baji' are considered as standard
 filmkaar anwar jamaal ne kaha, ‘gurudutt kii story teling kii kshamta adwitiya thi or krime thriller filmon ke nirmaan main unhone maanak tay kiya tha
 His films show many folds of the story and he was one of the filmmakers who understood the socio-political scenario
 unki filmon main koi cheez bevajaah nahin milti
 'he said,' Nowadays the crime thriller has been made very compressed and ugly, which looks a bit ridiculous and disgusting to watch
 vartmaan parivesh ko dekhakar lagata he ki yadi aaj gurudutt jivit hote to vah ‘raajnneetik thriller’ banaate
 He said that Guru Dutt could set the standard because people associated with literature, music, poetry and the creative side at that time belonged to cinema and it was only because of the relationship between literature and cinema that the story of his films was established with everyone Used to succeed jamaal ne kaha ki iske alaava unke daur main aam janata main bhi cinema ko samajhane kaa ek str tha
 He said, 'whatever appears in front of it cannot be the story of the film, for this it is very important to be folded
 ’ film sameekshak vinod bharadwaj ne kaha, ‘jahiraa taur par gurudutt hote to hindi filmodyog ko kai behtareen filmein dete
 People generally consider 'pyaasa' and 'pepper Ke Phool' as their best films, but in my view their best films were 'sahab Bibi Aur Ghulam'
 haalanki, aadhikarik taur par iske nirdeshak abraar alvi hai, lekin parade ke peeche se iskaa nirdesan gurudutt ne hi kiya tha
 He said that Gurudutt initially produced very good films and he was the standard filmmaker in the production and direction of crime thriller films

 Found the titles of kaise kii rashtriya geet kii rachanabankimchandra ne jab is geet kii rachana kii tab bharat par british shaskaon kaa dabadabaa tha
 a song from Britain was' God! Save the Queen '
 bharat ke har samaaroh main is geet ko anivaary kar diya gaya
 Bankim Chandra was in a government job then
 angrejon ke bartaav se bankim ko bahut bura laga or unhone saal 1876 main ek geet kii rachana kii or uskaa sheershak diya 'vande maataram'
 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 The front part was written in Bangla, which is the praise of Maa Durga
 30 ke hue mesi, jaane star footballar kaa 'sachin conection'rashtriya geet ke rup main mili pahchanasvadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat ai to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gai
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song 'vande Mataram', because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In the wake of these objections, in 1937, the Congress deeply pondered this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti, jisamen moulana abdul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gaye hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he
 Therefore, it was decided that only the first two verses of this song were used as national songs
 is tarah gurudev rabindra nath thakur ke jan-gana-man adhinaayak jai he ko yathaavat raashtragan hi rahane diya gaya or mohammad ikbaal ke kaumi taraane saare jahaan se acha ke saath bankimachandra chatarji dwaara rachit praarambhik do padon kaa geet vande maataram raashtragit sweekrut hua
 After achieving independence, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad read a statement in the Constituent Assembly on 24 January 1950 regarding the adoption of 'vande Mataram' as the national anthem, which was accepted

 congress mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi kaa dalit netaa va bhim army pramukh chandrashekhar se mulaakaat karnaa kai logon kii najar main priyanka kaa yah kadam basapa kii dukhati rag par haath rakhane jaisaa tha
 After this meeting, BSP chief Mayawati had made up her mind to field candidates against the Congress in Amethi and Rae Bareli, but later the coalition postponed the decision for the time being
 haalanki, sapa-basapa ne tay kar liya he ki agar ab congress ne duusari dukhati rag 'shivpal yadav' par congress ne haath rakhaa to amethi-raibareli donon siton par gathbandhan chunaav ladane kaa kadam uthaa saktaa he
 Let us know that immediately after meeting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's Dalit leader Chandrashekhar Azad, a sudden meeting of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav raised alarm bells for the Congress
 naaraaz mayawati amethi or raibareli main apane ummidavaar utarkar iskaa badla lenaa chaahati thi, lekin philhal gathbandhan abhi puraane formule par hi chunaav ladega
 In the meeting between Akhilesh and Mayawati, it was also decided that at present the Congress should be called only part of the alliance with 2 seats
 lekin sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne congress ke agle kadamon ko lekar satark he or usne wet and watch kii ranneeti apana rakhi he
 SP sources said that if the Congress party decides to form any alliance with Shivpal Yadav, there will be no other option but to field candidates against Rahul gandhi-sonia Gandhi in the parliamentary seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki priyanka gandhi ne chandrashekhar se milakar basapa ke dukhati rag par haath rakhaa diya tha
 In such a situation, if the Congress formed an alliance with Shivpal Yadav, then in Amethi and Rae Bareli, the Congress would have to face the alliance candidates
 darasal, amethi or raibareli congress kaa sabase majboot garh rahaa he
 This time in Amethi, BJP has put all its strength in Amethi
 aise main sapa-basapa ko maaloom he vahaan congress party risk lene kii jahamat nahin uthaa sakati he
 According to the leaders of the party, this is not blackmail but part of the strategy and the party has made a strategy to not pay more attention to the Congress at the moment

 a post shared bypriyanka Chopra Jonas(@priyankachopra) ondec 18, 2018 at 6:29am PST Center Kinendra Modi government has increased the minimum support price (MSP) of rabi crops to alleviate the resentment of farmers
 buudhvaar ko cabinet kii baithak main gehun, chanaa, sarson, jau or masoor kiemespemen badhotaree ko manjuuri di gai
 In such a situation, the question is that what is the reaction among the farmers of the country and whether the increase in the MSP is benefiting the farmers or not? The quintal is sold with wheat private agents at Rs 1690 per quintal
 jabaki us samay main sarkari kharid centre par 1735 rupee prati quintal tha
 Dalmir Singh says that he does not get the direct benefit of the increase in the MSP
 unhone kaha, 'iskaa phayda to unhen miltaa he jo sarkari kharid centre par bechate hai, ham to privet aadhat par jaakar apnifasalbechate hai
 'dalmir Singh has a lot of complaints about the government grain procurement center
 wo kehete hai ki sarkari centre bahut dikkatein hoti hai
 Two quintals of grain is stolen from half a million
 iske alaava do se teen quintal anaaj ko bekaar bataa diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, cash is also not received
 jabaki privet adhtiya ke paas aisi koi dikt nahin hoti he
 Kisan Rahat Khan, a resident of Ambetha town in Saharanpur district, said that the government has given relief to the farmers by increasing the MSP
 isse desh ke kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 He said that when the government increases the MSP, it has an effect on private agents and they buy by increasing the rate
 raahat khan har saal 150 quintal genhu or takreeban 175 quintal dhan bechate hai
 They sell their crop both at private agents and government procurement centers
 wo kehete hai ki privet aadhat main unhen kaaphi suvidhaae hai
 Whereas the farmer is very much harassed at the government center
 itane niyam kanoon bataa die jate hai ki kisaan dobaaraa centre par jaataa hi nahin he
 Sardar Lokendra Singh, a farmer of Bahedi in Bareilly district, says that the government center purchases the crops of the same farmers who are registered
 sabhi kisaanon kaa panjikrut nahin rahata he aise main unhen duusare panjikrut kisaanon se vauchar lekar bechnaa padataa he
 Because of this, instead of the selling farmer, the money goes to the account of the registered farmer
 jinase paisa lene ke liye kaaphi dikkat hoti he
 Due to this, we think it is better to sell your broker in private mode
 bagwat ke ratol gaanv ke rahane vaale kisaan surendra mittal kehete hai ki sarkaar kaa emspi main badhotaree karke kisaan ke hit main behatar kadam uthaaya he
 Its benefits not only at government centers but also on private agents
 lekin wo apane galle ko privet aadhat ke paas bechnaa behatar samajhate hai
 They say that we have to collect gunny bags to be sold at the government center
 jabaki privet aadhat ke hamaare vyaktigat sambandh hote hai wo ghar aakar khud le jate hai
 Not only this, on reading the need, we give money before purchasing the crop
 jabaki sarkari centre main fasal bechney ke baad paise aate hai or kabhi-kabhi to lanbaa intjaar bhi karnaa padataa he
 Gulzar Ahmed, who works as a private agent of Saharanpur, says that the government always increases the MSP at the time of harvest, but this time it has been done much earlier
 kisaan to apni fasal bech chukaa he
 In such a situation, farmers will get increased prices of kharif crops in march-april
 unhone kaha ki is samay emspi main badhotaree se kisaanon ke bajaay achhatiyon ko phayda milegaa
 This move of the government will also increase inflation in the market
 bataa den ki modi sarkaar ke dwaara emspi badaye jane ke baad genhu kaa nayaa mulya 1,735 rupye prati quintal se badhaakar 1,840 rupye prati quintal kar diya gaya he
 The MSP of gram has been increased from Rs 4,440 to Rs 4,612 per quintal
 vahiin, masoor kii daal kaa emspi 4,250 se badhaakar 4,475 rupee prati quintal ho gaya he
 Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said on Wednesday that by increasing the MSP of the Rabi crop, farmers will get an additional income of Rs 62,635 crore
 unhone kaha ki sarson par kisaanon kii laagat 2,212 rupee prati quintal aa rahi he or sarkaar iskaa emspi 4,200 rupee tay kiya he

 Devendra Singh said that the original draft of the civil service exam question paper should be prepared in Hindi instead of English
 prashn patr kaa angreji se hindi main anuwaad karne par sabase zyada ashuddhiyaan or galati hoti he
 Singh claimed that the last time 600 candidates had cleared the Civil Service Examination, out of which only 40 candidates who did not clear the exam in English
 sirf 14 ummidavaaron ne hindi main exam diya tha
 Devendra Singh said that at present the examination pattern is very much in favor of those who are from science background and reasoning is the most important in this
 upiessi ke prilims exam main ganit ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 He suggested that more attention should be paid to general studies in the examination

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee apane maa-maati-maanush ke naare se aage nikal chuki hai
 Even though the common man across the country has been complaining about inflation during the upa's two terms, it seems that in West Bengal, Mamata is determined to help the people
 to yadi aap chikan khaane ke shaukeen he to kolkata kii train pakad lijie or jab tak panchayat chunaav nahin ho jate dabaakar khaaie chikan
 Because this time Mamta Banerjee has become kind to the cock eaters
 farmaan jari kar diya he ki jisane 150 rupee kilo se zyada kaa bhav bechaa uski khayr nahin
 Chicken in the state ranged between Rs 180 and Rs 200 per kg
 khabaron ke anusaar rajya main jaruri chizon kii keemton par najar rakhane vaali tascaforce kii pichley hafte baithak hui, jisamen mukhyamantri mamata banerjee chikan kii badhati keemaaton se naaraaz dikhin
 Mamta then ordered that the chicken should not be sold in the state at more than Rs 150 per kg
 tascaforce ke ek pravaktaa ne bataaya ki ye keemton kolkata nagar nigam ke antargat aane vaale sabhi bazaaron par lagu hoga
 Mamta also ordered an inquiry into the unusual increase in poultry prices
 mamata banerjee kaa ye farmaan upar-upar se graahakon ko jarur lubhaa rahaa he lekin unhen andeshaa bhi ho rahaa he ki agar sasta chikan bechney kaa dabaav padaa to vyapaaree apni laagat nikaalane ke liye quality se samjhauta kar sakate hai
 On the other hand, traders say that they cost 150 rupees, so how will they be able to do business
 mamata pehle bhi logon ke hit main aise lokapriy faisle leti raheen hai jisase aam log khush to hote hai lekin mamata ke kuch faislon kaa majaak bhi banataa he
 Panchayat elections are going to be held in Bengal and it is obvious that the chickens do not vote, but by making the lives of the chickens affordable, there can be a lot of happiness to please the voters
 vaise mamata kaa ye anokhaa idia kis had tak lagu ho paaegaa, ise lekar bhi logon ke bheetar andeh he
 Because the ground reality of the rest of the government announcements is visible to everyone
 ab mamata kaa nayaa naaraa maa-maati-maanush-murgi kya gul khilaataa he ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 But it is certain that Mamta has given good gifts to chicken lovers with this slogan

 Reversing its former chairman Mistry, the company said that the trusts of the Tata group are operated by the personal wills of Jamsetji Tata and his two sons
 iske saath hi company ne mistre par companiyon ko baari vittiya nuksaan pahunchane kaa aarope lagaaya he

 ' jin companiyon ko nuksaan hua he unamem ve companiyaan bhi shaamil hai jinke chairman mistre abhi bane hue hai
 Tata Sons said in a statement, "the trusts are governed by the personal wills of Jamsetji Tata, his sons Sir Dorabji Tata and Ratan Tata and other founders

 “this is why various trusts have been operating for decades

 haryana main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aa rahe hai or lag rahaa he jaise ki congress ke sookhte janaadhar main nirmal jal kaa ek sota footkar use phir se jivit kar gaya ho
 Haryana is also probably the land of Saraswati
 haryana kaa naam lete hi kurukshetra or saraswati nadi, ye do naam to jehn main aate hi hai
 So in today's Nadi Sutra, the same Saraswati river, which is believed to secretly join the Sangam in Prayagraj
 vahi nadi jo vaidic kaal main behad mahatvapurn hua karti thi
 By the way, the news is also that the Union Ministry of Hydropower has also discovered a dry river in Prayagraj that connects the Ganges and Yamuna
 rashtriya svachh ganga mishan ke mutabik, is khoj kaa makasad tha ki ek sambhavit bhumigat jal ke richarge strot kaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 Regarding this ancient river, the ministry said that it is 4 km wide and 45 km long and it has a 15 thick layer inside the ground
 pichley saal disambar main is nadi kii khoj main siesaiar-enziarai (neshnal jeeophysics research institute) or kendriya bhumigat jal board ne ek jeeophysical hawaii survey ke dauraan kiya
 However, if it is Saraswati, then which is the Saraswati that was tried to be found in Haryana and Rajasthan? Did Saraswati change her path due to the tectonic plate movements of the Indian subcontinent? Where did that river disappear? About the same question in 1893, 120 years ago, an English engineer c
 epa
 Oldham had also emerged, when they passed through the dry valley of this river i
e
 Ghaggar
 tab oldham ne pehali pariklpana di ki ho na ho, yah pracheen vishaal nadi saraswati kii ghati he, jisamen sutluj nadi kaa pani miltaa tha
 And whom the sage-sages wrote in the Rigveda (richa 2
 41
 16) In "ambi Tame, Nadi Tame, Devi Tame Saraswati" means the greatest mother, the biggest river, the biggest goddess
 rugveda main is bhubhag ke varnan main pashchim main sindhu or purv main saraswati nadi ke bich paanch nadiyon jhelum, chenab, sutluj, raavi or vyas kii upasthiti kaa zikr he
 Rigveda (richa 7
 36
 6) describes Saraswati as the mother of the Indus and other rivers
 is nadi ke lupt hone ko lekar oldham ne kaha tha ki kudarat ne karavat badali or sutluj ke pani ne sindhu nadi kaa rukh kar liya
 However, after that, several hypotheses cutting across each other about the nature of Saraswati came out
 1990 ke dashak main mili satellite chitron se pehali baar us nadi kaa motaa khaakaa duniya ke saamne aayaa
 These maps show an underground river valley-like shape from the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea, about 20 km in width
 ab sawaal he ki koi nadi itani chaudaai main to nahin bah sakati, to aakhir us nadi kaa sateek rasta or aakaar kya tha? in sawaalon ke jawaab dhundgaye ke liye 2011 ke ant main iity kanpur ke saath biechayu or landan ke imperial college ke visheshgyon ne shodh shuru kiya
 According to the news published in India Today, in late 2012, the team published a research paper in the journal Quaternary of the International Union of Quaternary Research
 iskaa sheershak tha: jio electric racistivity avidence for sabasarphes peleochannel systams adjacent tu hadappan cites in northwest india
 It claimed: "this study presents geophysical evidence for the first time of the underground water system of ghaggar-hakra rivers
 ” yah shodhpatr yojana ke pehle charan ke puraa hone ke baad saamne aayaa or saakshyon kii talash main abhi yah lupt saraswati kii ghati main pashchim kii ore badhata jayega
 The first evidence confirmed the hypothesis that the Saraswati River, like the Ghaggar, originated from the higher Himalayas, the origin of rivers like the Indus and Sutlej, at the foothills of the Himalayas
 adhyayan kii shuruyaat ghagghar nadi kii vartmaan dhara se kahin dur sarhind gaanv se hui or pehle nattejey hi chaunkaane vaale aae
 In Sirhind, a 40 to 50 meter thick layer of sand filled with clean water was found below the ground
 yah ghati jameen ke bheetar 20 kimi main faili he
 The amount of water in its middle is much higher than the edges
 khaas baat yah he ki sarhind main sataha par aisa koi sanket nahin miltaa jisase andaja lag sake ki jameen ke neeche itani badi nadi ghati maujuud he
 Rather, there is a very hard surface just below the ground
 pani kii itani badi maatra sahaayak nadi main nahin balki mukhya nadi main ho sakati he
 Researchers then told India Today that the fingerprint of the pebbles originated here suggests that the river originated from the high Himalayas
 koi 1,000 kimi
 Used to travel in the Arabian Sea
 iske bahaav kii tulana vartmaan main ganga nadi se kii ja sakati he
 This evidence of Sirhind confirmed Saraswati's independent presence beyond Ghaggar
 yani sutluj or saraswati ke rishte kii jo baat oldham ne 120 saal pehle sochi thi, bhu-bhautikeey sakshya us par pehali baar muhar laga rahe the
 Then how did these rivers separate? Over time, the glaciers that fed the Saraswati River dried up
 in halaat main yaa to nadi kaa bahaav khatm ho gaya yaa phir sindhu, sutluj or yamuna jaisi baad kii nadiyon ne is nadi ke bahaav kshetra par kabja kar liya
 During this entire process, the water of the Saraswati river drifted towards the east and the water of the Sutlej river shifted towards the west
 baad kii sabhyataaen ganga or uski sahaayak nadi yamuna (purvavarti chambal) ke taton par viksit huin
 Earlier there was no Yamuna river and Chambal river used to flow
 lekin uthapatak ke daur main himachal pradesh main ponta sahib ke paas nai nadi yamuna ne saraswati ke jal strot par kabja kar liya or aage jaakar isamen chambal bhi mil gai
 That is, the Sutlej, a tributary of Saraswati, migrated along with it to the west and merged with the Indus and in the east, the Saraswati and Yamuna emerged in the valley of Chambal
 aise main is baat ko bal miltaa he ki bhale hi prayag main ganga-yamuna-saraswati ke sangam kaa koi bhubhautikeey sakshya na miltaa ho lekin yamuna ke saraswati ke jalmaarg par kabje kaa pramaan in nadiyon ke alag tarah ke rishte kii ore ishaara karata he
 On the other hand, the Thar desert came in the midst of the original paths through which Saraswati used to flow
 lekin is nadi ke puraane rup kaa varnan rugveda main miltaa he
 Verse of the Rigveda (7
 36
 6) states, "O the seventh river Saraswati, which is the mother of the Indus and other rivers and makes the land fertile, give us abundant food together and irrigate it with our water
" ”iity kanpur ke sound racistivity par aadhaarit aankade bataate hai ki kalibanga or munak gaanv ke paas jameen ke neeche saaf pani se bhari nadi ghati kii jatil sanrachana maujuud he
 Studies conducted at both these places revealed that there is a sand base filled with fresh water more than 12 km wide and 30 meters thick within the ground
 jabaki maujuuda ghagghar nadi kii chaudaai mahaj 500 meter or gaharaai paanch meter hi he
 The freshwater-filled sand within the ground shows a complex structure, with many different streams joining a large river
 yah jatil sanrachana aisi nadi ko dikhaati he jo aaj se kahin adhik barish or pani kii maujuudagi vaale kalkhand main astitv main thi yaa phir nadiyon ke pani kaa vibhaajan hone ke kaaran ab kahin or bahati he
 The study further suggests that above this freshwater-filled sand is a layer of mud-filled sand
 is parat kii motaai kareeb 10 meter he
 This silt-laden layer points to the period when the river water dried up and the mud layer over it was deposited
 ye do paraten is baat kaa pramaan hai ki pracheen nadi bade aakaar main bahati thi or baad main suukh gai
 And much later after both these incidents, the Ghaggar-like rainy river came into existence
 satellite image dikhaati he ki saraswati kii ghati haryana main kurukshetra, kaithal, fatehabad, sirsa, anupgarh, rajasthan main sriganganagar, hanumangarh, thar kaa marusthal or phir gujarat main khambhaat kii khadi tak jaati thi
 There are many such borewells in Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district, from which water has been coming out automatically for many years
 ye borwell 1998 main mishan saraswati yojana ke tahat bhumigat nadi kaa pataa lagane ke liye khode gaye the
 During this time, the Central Ground Water Board dug 9 tube wells and 80 tube wells by Rajasthan Ground Water Department in an area of 80 km from Kishangarh to Ghotaru
 registan main nikalataa pani logon ke liye aashcharya se kam nahin he
 The water released from the tubewells was considered by the Bhabha Atomic Research Center to be 3,000 to 4,000 years old
 yani aane vaale dinon main kuch or romaanchak jaankariyaan mil sakati hai
 Scientific evidence and historical, archaeological and geographical facts revolving around them are testimony to the lost Saraswati in Hades
 haalanki vigyaan aasthaa se ek baat main sahamat nahin he or is asahmati ke bahut gambhir myne bhi hai
 It is believed that Saraswati is disappearing and flowing into the ground, while IIT research says that the river is not flowing, but there is a large reservoir of water in its underground valley
 agar lupt nadi ghati se lagaataar bade paimaane par borwell ke jariye pani nikaala jaataa rahaa to pataal main paithi nadi hameshaa ke liye suukh jaaegi, kyonki usamen nae pani kii aapurti nahin ho rahi he
 Scientists want that the water of the frozen river in the Hades is not used inappropriately because if this was done, then the Saraswati which had disappeared from the surface some 4,000 years ago, would also disappear from the Hades

 log in kisi sangeen jurm ke maamle main sanlipt 16 saal ke kishor ko baligon kii shrenee main shaamil karne ke liye kishor nyaay kanoon main sanshodhan kii centre sarkaar kii pahal ke baad vibhinn raajnneetik dal ke netaaon or buddhijiviyon kaa maananaa he, ki keval dand dene ke liye kishor ko balig maanane kii bajaae balig hone kii umr ko hi 16 saal kar dena chahie
 Laxmikanta Chawla, the national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said, "the Union Council of Ministers has approved the suggestion of the Minister of Child Development to punish a teenager aged 16 who is involved in hate crimes
 Will be considered a major
 centre sarkaar ne iske liye kishor nyaay kanoon main badlaav ko manjuuri de di he
 Chawla said, "once this happens, action will be taken to punish the minor under the Indian Penal Code and not under the Juvenile Justice Act
" main centre sarkaar se poochna chaahati hum, ki agar dand dene ke liye 16 saal ke kishor ko balig mana ja saktaa he to baaki sabhi kaaryon ke liye use balig kyon nahin maan liya jaae
 It would be better if the government reduces the age of majority in the country to 16 years
 ’duusari ore rashtriya balak adhikaar sangrakshan ayog kii purv sadsy sandhya bajaj ne kaha, ‘sabase jaruri yah jaananaa hota he ki kishor ne kisi khaas manshaa se aparaadh kiya he yaa nahin or agar kiya he to vah or jurm bhi kar saktaa he, aise main use balig maananaa chahie
 Sandhya Bajaj agreed with the BJP vice-president, saying, "it would be better if the government accepts 16-year-old children for every job and it should be provided every facility for adults, because if the juvenile can be a crime in crime Then why should he wait two more years for other work
 ’chawla or sandhya donon ne kaha, ‘sarkaar na keval dand dene ke liye balki sabhi kaam ke liye 16 saal ke kishor ko balig maan le ore use matdaan kaa adhikaar, naukari paane kaa adhikaar, driving license or vivaah aadi kii anumati de di jaae
 The BJP vice-president said, "the Ministry of Child Development should consider the age of 16 to be an adult for all work, only the juvenile should not be considered an adult for hanging
 ’isse pehle sandhya ne kaha, ‘sarkaar ko bacchon ke adhikaar ke prati jaagruk hona chahie
 There is already a law in the country 'care and Protection Act
 ’ agar is kanoon kaa sahi tareeke se paalan kiya jaae or bacchon kaa shuru se dhyaan rakhaa jaae to aisi ghatnaayen hongi hi nahin
 'sandhya, president of the Women's wing of Haryana Janhit Congress, said,' i welcome the move to consider the age of 16 to be an adult, but it should not be for one purpose only
 jab main ayog kii sadsy thi tab bhi maine bal vikaas mantri ko patr likh kar 16 saal tak ke bacchon ko matdaan kaa adhikaar or naukari die jane kii sifarish kii thi
 'famous novelist Drs
 ajay sharma is bare main kehete hai, ‘nishchit taur par har kaary ke liye sarkaar ko balig hone kii umr 18 saal se gata kar 16 saal kar deni chahie
 Now the children studying in 11th and 12th also go to school on scooter motorcycle or go to coaching etc
, because bike has become fashion
 unke paas license nahin hone ke kaaran police unase paise leti he
 Parents of children also face problems with this
 ’unhone kaha ki 16 saal ke kishor ko balig keval dand dene ke liye maanane kii bajaae unhen har kaam ke liye balig maan liya jaae to samaaj se bhrashtachar or aparaadh ko khatm karne main safalataa milegi
 Union Minister Jairam Ramesh today admitted that the Congress had lost the battle on the level of perception, as the top leadership did not communicate with the people
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki satta main 10 saal rahane ke baad congress satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana kar rahi he
 Ramesh said that this election campaign is challenging, but the party will win a respectable three-digit vote
 ramesh ne ek intervyuu main kaha ki atisakriy nyaaypalika, kaig jaise behad sakriy sanvaidhanik adhikari, aakraamak media or gaiyr jimmedaar naagarik samaaj mil gaye hai
 He said that our response was also slow
 hamane apni baat prabhaavshaalee tareeke se nahin pahunchaai
 Our top leadership did not communicate
 raajnneeti samvaad par aadhaarit he, isliye ham dharna ke str par ladaai haar gaye or hamane unhen paryaapt rup se gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Ramesh was asked what went wrong in the last two years of the UPA government which led to the perception of a corrupt and indecisive government
 is prashn ke uttar main ramesh ne yah baat kahi
 bjp's campaign-centric Ramesh emphasized that there is no need to be defensive or apologetic about the performance of UPA 2 and that the Congress would win a respectable three-digit number of votes in the elections
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kii muhim vyakti par kendrit he
 He said that person-centric campaigns in the media make more news
 isliye modi jo kuch bhi karte he, vah jo kuch bhi kehete he, media uske peeche jaataa he
 Ramesh said that the Congress campaign is decentralized and is largely on its way
 unhone kaha ki ek kute kaa aadmi ko kaatna koi khabar nahin he
 Biting a man's dog becomes headlines
 survey hai sunahare sapaneunhone chunaav purv surveykshan ke anumaanon ko narendra modi ke sunahare sapane qaraar diya
 Ramesh said that Congress is unaware of poll surveys which have always judged bjp's performance more than reality, whether it is in 2004 or 2009
 unhone kaha ki yogendra yadav jo ki bahut gahan or gambhir chunaav vishleshan karte hai, unhone ek baar kaha tha ki chunaav purv surveykshan sahi nahin rahe hai or unhone hameshaa bijepi ko vaastaviktaa se adhik aanka he
 Haramesh, the winning turtle, said that Congress is like a turtle in the story of rabbit and turtle
 antat: jeet kachhue kii hoti he
 Describing Rahul as a marathon man, a long distance runner, he said he has a strategy for the party
 yah puche jane par ki kya chunaavon main modi lahar he, ramesh ne nahin main jawaab diya lekin unhone saath hi kaha ki modi ko lekar kaaphi charchaa he
 Many of these things have been generated by the BJP itself
 soshal media or aresas ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich modi kii charchaa he
 He said what happens with the discussion
 bijepi kaa ek sutri agenda modi he
 She is not saying vote not to BJP but to Modi
 charchaa to hogi hi kyonki modi drameybaaj hai or yah unke bolne ke tareeke or bhashaa se spasht hota he
 BJP is weak, criticizing BJP, said that the weakness of the party is evident from the fact that it is doing alliances in various states
 sarkaar ke pradarshan ke bare main poochne par ramesh ne kaha ki ise lekar rakshaatmak hone kii koi jarurat nahin he kyonki samprag kii satta main aath pratishat or samprag do ke kaarykaal main 7
 There was 3 percent growth while the NDA tenure grew at 6 percent

 Mobile phone number 3 in India when we came to power
 5 karod thi or ab yah lagbhag 90 karod he
 Our call rates are the cheapest in the world

 ' ravivaar ko rajdhani dilli ek khabar se sann rah gai
 The news of 11 bodies found in one house shook the entire city
 har koi bas yahi sochataa rah gaya ki aakhir aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 How can one kill all the people of the same family? in sawaalon ke bich police kii shuruaati tafteesh jaise-jaise aage badi, ek saath puure parivaar kii maut par uth rahe sawaalon ke jawaab bhi milane lage
 There were indications that the turn of Tantra-mantra became the reason for the death of this large family
 haalanki, yah khudakushi he yaa shaatir ranneeti ke tahat kii gai hatya, iskaa khulaasa hona abhi baaki he
 But the documents found from that house are very shocking
 dilli police ko buraadi ilaake ke jis ghar main 11 shav mili, vahaan se kuch likhit dastavej mili hai
 These documents reveal a shocking revelation in this case
 dastavejon main baqayada puure parivaar kii maut kii patakatha likhi hui he
 In the investigation of the house, two such registers have been found in the police, in which this surprising information is written
 register main jaise-jaise likhaa hua he, thik usee haalat main 10 shav ghar ke andar latake mili hai, jabaki gyarahavaan shav duusare kamare main padaa mila he
 The police are also shocked by this information
 jiske baad register main likhi dharmik baton or tantric kriyaaon ke aadhaar ke angel se bhi jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Explain that the investigation of the case is being done by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police
 police kaa maananaa he ki ye dastavej nishchit taur par rahasyamay prathaon ke paalan kii ore ishaara kar rahe hai
 What is written in the register According to Delhi Police sources, the register found from home has been written by hand
 inamen likhaa he, 'agar aap stool kaa istemaal karenge, ankhen band karenge or haath baandh lenge to aapako moksh kii prapti hogi
 According to police sources, in some 35 pages of the two registers, some pages of the beginning mention where and where to hang the person
 yani baqayada ye likhaa hua he ki parivaar ke koun se sadsy ko kis jagah latakkar jaan deni he
 Especially it has also been written which person has to hang from the door
 'sabase zyada chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki ghar se baraamad kaagajon par maut kii jo ibaarat likhi hui he, bilkul vaise hi andaaj main ye puraa parivaar kaal ke gaal main samaa gaya
 When police reached inside the house, the dead bodies have been found hanging as per written instructions in the register

 While sons Bhavnas and Lalit, along with both their wives Savita and Tina and their children, Nidhi, Shivam, Maneka and Dhruv were found hanging from iron mesh
 inke alaava 57 saal kii pratibha or unki beti priyanka jisaki 17 june ko sagaai hui thi, unke shav khidki se latake mili
 According to sources, all but Bhavnesh and Lalit had their hands tied tight
 mandir ke bagal se mili registerburadi ke sant nagar ilaake main jis ghar main ye parivaar rahata tha, usee ke andar ek chota mandir bana hua he
 The police have found both these registers from this temple during the investigation
 inamen november 2017 se entry karnaa shuru kii gai thim, jabaki aakhri baar isi saal 25 june ko register main likhaa gaya tha
 Such small things are also mentioned in the register, which are often not seen and heard
 masalan, register main ye bhi likhaa paaya gaya he ki kaan main coton daalana he or mobile phone alag rakhana he
 Police found the same picture in the investigation
 police jaanch ke dauraan shavon ke kaan main coton mili hai, jabaki mobile phone bhi alag pade paae gaye hai
 On the basis of this information, it is feared that the whole family is getting trapped in some kind of religious-spiritual cycle
 ashanka ye bhi he ki puure parivaar ne moksh hasil karne kii kaamana se kuch khaas dharmik ritiyon ke chalate khudakushi kii he
 However, the clue given to the forensic team also reveals that a family member killed the remaining members and committed suicide after that

 However, no signs of conflict have been found on the bodies
 vahiin, duusari taraf ye jaankaree bhi mili he ki puure parivaar ne apni ankhen daan kii hui hai

 In search of a life partner at a matrimonial site, a young woman's life was spoiled
 ek shaks ne khud ko america main software ejeeniyar bataakar yuvati se shaadi kaa vaada kiya
 Take him to the hotel and have a physical relationship with him
 iske baad main kundali nahin milane kii baat kahkar shaadi ke liye manaa kar diya
 On the complaint of the victim, Vasantkunj North police station has registered a rape case
 aaropee nitin kii talash kii ja rahi he
 According to the victim's statement, she is an assistant professor in Jabalpur
 saal 2017 main metrimonial site ke jariye nitin se uski jaan-pahchaan hui thi
 After this both of them decided to get married
 aaropee jab bhi america se dilli aata, peedita ko milane ke liye vasantkunj sthit ek hotel main bula letaa
 The last time the two met was on 10 February
 iske baad aaropee ne america se lautne ke baad shaadi kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin baad main america jaakar kundali nahin milane kii baat kah shaadi se peeche gaya
 If the victim believes, the accused also switched off his mobile
 isse pareshaan hokar peedita ne use kai imail bhi kiye, lekin usne uskaa koi jabaav nahin diya
 Eventually the victim reached Vasantkunj police station
 peedita kii taharir ke aadhaar par police ne aaropee ke khilaaf cese darj karke maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 Let us tell you that by creating fake profiles on the matrimonial website, cases of cheating of girls keep coming up
 haal hi main dilli main ek duusare shaks ko isi aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 The accused used to present himself as a high-ranking officer in a channel office in Mumbai
 iske jaal main ek ladki funs gai thi
 The accused had maintained their fake profiles on two prominent matrimonial websites
 peedita se sampark main aane ke baad usne apane pita ko cancer kaa marij bataakar unke ilaaj ke naam par 6 lakh rupee le liye the
 When the reality of the accused came to light, the victim approached the police
 jaanch ke baadpulicene aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 Finally, the entire investigation has been stuck on an email id
 bharat ke sabase kukhyat hathiyaar saudagar ke khilaaf jaanch dakshin dilli ke farmahouson main hone vaali or ayyashi kii hadon ko chune vaali partiyon se shuru hui thi
 When the officers followed the clues found in them, they were embarrassing pictures of politicians shortlisted for blackmail; Through secret accounts opened in countries known as tax evaders' paradise and fraudulent companies created around the world, there was a raft of documents kept hidden as a precaution, which contained some of the most revealing secrets of the armed forces
 jaanch agenciyon ne abhishek verma ke khilaaf takreeban aadha darjan maamalon (graphic dekhen) ke bikhare hue taar kadi mehnat se ek-duusare se jode
 Verma is the same person who miraculously recovered from the stain of the 2006 Naval War Room leak case as the 'manager' of the South Block
 lekin uske ek ranjishjada sahyogi (escro fund manager) si
 When Edmunds Allen introduced new evidence in New York in 2012, it again caught up
 uske khilaaf chal rahe maamalon kii jaanch antim sire par pahunchane hi vaali thi ki jaanch agenciyaan ek digital avrodh se takaraakar ladkadaati dikhaai de rahi hai
 Much of the CBI evidence against Verma rests on a foundation
 vah buniyaad yah he ki usne alan ko kai dastavej niyamit rup se i-mail se bheje the, jinamein bank khaaton, vyavsaayik saudon or gopneey dastavejon ke byore darj the
 These were the documents Allen submitted in 2012 as evidence
 isi ke baad jaanch kaa silsilaa shuru hua tha
 But now CBI has claimed that it cannot prove that one of these e-mail id evaherzigova @ gmail
 com (jo shaayad ek check model ke naam par he or jiske madhyam se kuch sabase mahatvapurn dastavej alan ko bheje gaye the) kaa istemaal sirf or sirf verma hi karata tha
 The report presented in the court states, "it could not be proved during the investigation that evaherzigova @ gmail
 com kaa istemaal puri tarah se sirf verma hi karata tha
 "the CBI has filed this closure report in the case which is least controversial in the ongoing cases against Verma
 isamen verma par aarope he ki usne 2009 ke nausena waar room li maamle main use clin chit dene vaali sibiai afasar kii ek kathith jaali chitthee taiyaar kii
 But now the whole bundle of evidence from the cbi's closure report seems to be weakening, which has been chalked up against this infamous (even if smart) businessman
 sibiai kii report haalanki abhi adaalat ne manjuur nahin kii he
 The reasons for discontinuing the investigation are listed in this
 inamen ek yah vajah bhi shaamil he ki jaali chitthee kaa koi pramanit labhaarthi nahin he
 Another important thing has been said that the email id could not be proved to have a direct relationship with Verma
 agar adaalat is report ko manjuur kar leti he, to yah verma ke khilaaf sarkari gopneeyata kanoon (oese) ke tahat chal rahe sabase samvedansheel maamalon main khud sibiai ke rukh ke khilaaf ja sakati he kyonki ye maamle isi aadhaar par tike hai ki verma ne is i-mail aaidi se samvedansheel dastavej videsh bheje the
 The evidence against Verma in the hands of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) (ranging from sensitive documents from the Air Force and the Army and alleged fake letters of a minister and a CBI officer to details of bank accounts), most of them digital
 ye saboot do saal pehle is hathiyaar saudagar se jhagada hone ke baad alan ne die the
 If the investigating agencies are unable to prove that Verma sent these documents to Allen by e-mail, then these cases may fall on their face
 yahi nahin, aaj ke digital yug main jaanch agenciyaan technology ke saath ajeebogareeb khel khilne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 She followed the IP address of the email id to Verma's farmhouse, where she is the only tenant
 iske baavjood sibiai ne closer report main kaha he ki vah nirnaayak taur par yah sabit nahin kar sakati ki verma ne hi dastavej bhejne ke liye is i-mail aaidi kaa istemaal kiya tha
 On this, Alan says that this stance of the agency is legally so heavy that it can lead to all cases against Verma
 alan ne india today se kaha, “abhishek verma ke haathon sibiai ke patr kii kathith jaalsaji ke maamle main adaalat agar yah closer report manjuur kar leti he, to is samay bharat kii kai duusari adaalaton main uske khilaaf chal rahe sibiai or idi ke sabhi maamalon ke kanoonee taur par khaarij hone kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 Allen has also written to the Prime Minister's Office about this
 verma do se saal se zyada samay se jail main he
 Although he keeps tweeting occasionally and mysteriously, he could not be contacted to take his side
 alabatta uski kanoonee team ne closer report kaa swaagat kiya he or unhen bharosa he ki maamle radd ho jaaenge
 Verma's lawyer Maninder Singh told India Today, "there is no strong evidence against my client in any case
" yahaan tak ki bahucharchit nausena waar room li cese main bhi uski bhoomika anupoorak aaropapatr main aati he
 The second case under the Government Secrets Act is also entirely Hawaii
 ”haalanki sibiai kaa kahana he ki samaapan report kaa asar duusare maamalon kii jaanch par nahin padegaa or zyaadaatar maamalon main mukademe tej raftaar se aage bad rahe hai
 a spokeswoman for the investigating agency said, "we have strong evidence and this closing report will not have any effect on the investigation of other cases
" ” agency ke mutabik samaapan report sirf is tathy par aadhaarit nahin he ki i-mail aaidi se verma kaa sambandh sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa, vah duusare pahaluon par bhi aadhaarit he—asal jaalsaaj kaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa, na hi is baat kaa saboot he ki verma ne dhokhaa dene ke liye chitthee kaa istemaal kiya
 (abhishek Verma in his good days) The officer privately admits that when the strands of crime are spread across many areas, the agency usually finds it difficult to gather electronic evidence to present in court
 ek varisht sibiai afasar kehete hai, “digital / electronic saboot kaa apana jeevankaal hota he
 If they are not confiscated in time, they lose their meaning
 yah bhi sabit karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki in sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he yaa nahin
 Investigators also say that cases against Verma will have to face bigger hurdles
 haalanki unhen ummid he ki ve verma or uske sahyogiyon ke ugaahe gaye dhan ko talash karke jabt karne main kaamyaab honge
 In particular, the ED has seized some funds and has caused significant damage to Verma's funds
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki pichley do saal main ahm maamle bhi zyada aage nahin bade hai
 For example, take the case of documents being leaked from the Ministry of Defense
 isamen agar jurm sabit ho gaya, to verma ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 The CBI is yet to ascertain who leaked the Air Force's annual acquisition plans, a summary report of the most important acquisition projects and a database prepared from the Air Force headquarters to monitor the IAF projects
 yaa sena kii shastr pranaaliyon ke byore or samudr main toh lene vaale vimaan ke bare main nausena kii gopneey report kisne li kii
 Of course, CBI has to face many hurdles
 aisa bhi mumkin he ki duusare mulk pratyrpan vaali chitthee na den or yah bhi sambhav he ki alan bhartiya adaalat main gavaahi dene ke liye aane ko taiyaar na ho
 There is also no doubt that he is facing a very powerful and high-profile accused
 misaal dekhieh haal hi main ek iphone or 30 pannon ke likhit note idi ke haath lag gaye, jo mani londring ke aaropon kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 According to the investigating officers, iphone was recovered from Varma's employee's house during the raid
 shaq he ki verma bhi gaahe-bagaahe iskaa istemaal karata tha
 It contains details allegedly harming the Tihar jail authorities, which shows how they are providing 'amenities' to Verma in the jail by charging money
 baraamad note se verma ke un kathith nirdeshon kaa khulaasa hota he, jo usne apane kareebi sahaayakon ko dhan laane or pahunchane ke liye die the
 In a note, Verma has written to his man that he lives in Dubai, four crores from the wife of a former colleague
 le aae
 Verma's lawyer denies the allegations
 haalanki duusare maamalon main idi jarur kuch aage badha he
 These include 39 paintings and recovery of Rolex watches during a raid on Verma's farmhouse
 agency ne painting kaa bazaar mulya jaanane ke liye rashtriya aadhunik kala sangrahalay kii madad maangi
 This is probably M
 epa
 There are paintings by Hussain and Manu Parekh and other artists and are valued at Rs 20 crore
 ke kareeb he
 The way these cases proceed against India's most well-known arms dealer, this investigation rests on the strength of the authorities' intentions
