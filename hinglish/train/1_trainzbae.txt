 Sachin Pilot became MP at the age of 26
 31 saal main mantri or 33 saal main congress ke pradesh adhyaksh
 Due to these special characteristics, he is ahead in the race of CM
 haalanki, gahalot or payalat main kiske naam par faisla hoga, is par payalat khud maanate hai ki jo kismat main likhaa he use koi chin nahin saktaa, jo nahin likhaa wo ho nahin saktaa
 Regarding the role he is going to get in Rajasthan, he has never said that he does not know about the future, but has definitely brought the party to the place where we are in a position to form the government
 is baat se saaf he ki payalat kahin na kahin siem pad kii aakanksha jarur rakhte hai
 Sachin Pilot, who earned a lot of name in public life at a young age, is currently one of the veteran leaders of the state
 congress ke diggaj netaa or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke kareebi rahe rajesh payalat ke bete sachin ne shuruaati padhai dilli or uske baad america main kii

 The biggest thing is that Pilot had achieved the title of being the youngest MP in India at the age of 26
 2004 se 2008 tak ve samajhadaari ke saath siyasat dekhte or samajhate rahe
 This phase became a golden phase for him because when the Congress formed the government at the Center for the second time in 2008, he was made the Minister of Communications and Information Technology in the Cabinet
 philhal, wo rajasthan main congress adhyaksh or navnirvaachit vidhayak hai
 Sachin Pilot has taken the pilot's personal license to fly the plane

 Many many happy returns sweetheart may god bless you always @ritssajdeha photo posted by @ rohitsharma45 on Dec 20, 2015 at 8:00 pm PST 13 disambar ko hui shaadi va resepshan Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar
 is saal ramajaan kaa pavitra maheenaa 7 may 2019 se shuru hua he
 Ramadan is also known as the 'month of Quran', because the Quran was descended through Prophet Mohammed in this month
 ramajaan main rojaa-namaaj or kuran kii tilavat (kuran padhane) ke saath jakaat or fitra (daan yaa charity) dene kaa bhi bahut mahatv he
 Zakat is one of the 5 pillars of Islam
 islam ke mutabik, jis musalmaan ke paas bhi itnaa paisa yaa sampatti ho ki wo uske apane kharch puure ho rahe hon or wo kisi kii madad karne kii sthiti main ho to vah daan karne kaa paatr ban jaataa he
 In Ramadan this donation is given in two forms, Fitra and Zakat
 aaie jaanate hai fitra or jakaat kya hota he
 What is Zakat (donation) In Islam, it is said that it is necessary to give zakat on every fortunate Muslim in the Pak month of Ramadan
 aamadani se puure saal main jo bachat hoti he, uskaa 2
 5 per cent is given to a poor or needy, called Zakat
 yani agar kisi musalmaan ke paas tamaam kharch karne ke baad 100 rupee bachate hai to usamen se 2
 It is necessary to give 5 rupees to a poor person
 yun to jakaat puure saal main kabhi bhi di ja sakati he, lekin vittiya varsh samaapt hone par ritern file karne kii tarah zyaadaatar log ramajaan ke puure maheene main hi jakaat nikaalte hai
 Muslims assess their full year earnings in this month and 2 of them
 5 fisadi daan karte hai
 Actually there is a tradition of paying zakat in Ramadan before Eid
 yah jakaat khaskar garibon, vidhwaa mahilaon, anaath bacchon yaa kisi biimaar va kamjor vyakti ko di jaati he
 If women or men have any property in the form of jewelery, then zakat is also given according to its value
 lekin jo log haisiyatmand hote hue bhi allaah kii raja main jakaat nahin dete hai, wo gunaahagaaron main shumaar he
 Who has to pay Zakat: If there are five members in the family and they all earn money through job or by any means, then it is considered a duty to pay zakat on all the members of the family
 masalan, agar koi betaa yaa beti bhi naukari yaa kaarobaar ke jariye paisa kamaate hai to sirf unke maa-baap apni kamai par jakaat dekar nahin batch sakate hai, balki kamaane vaale bete yaa beti par bhi jakaat dena ferj hota he
 Regarding Zakat, the Prophet Mohammad has said, 'those who do not offer Zakat during the month of Ramadan, their fasting and worship is not acceptable, but stops between the earth and heaven
 'kya he fitrafitra wo rakam hoti he jo khate-pite, saadhan sampann gharaanon ke log aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko dete hai
 It is necessary to pay it before Eid prayers
 is tarah amir ke saath hi garib kii saadhan sampann ke saath id bhi man jaati he
 The amount of Fitre is also given to the poor, the Beawas and the Jatim and all the needy
 is sabake peeche soch yahi he ki id ke din koi khaali haath na rahe, kyonki yah khushi kaa din he
 The big difference between Zakat and Fitray is that giving Zakat is as important as fasting and reading Namaz, but giving Islam is not necessary under Islam
 fitre ke bare main islamic scollar moulana abdul hamin nomani ne bataaya ki jakaat main 2
 It is decided to give 5 per cent, while there is no limit to Fitre
 insaan apni haisiyat ke hisaab se kitna bhi fitra de saktaa he
 At the same time, throwing light on Zakat and Fitra, Public Relations Officer of the world-renowned Islamic Institute Darul Uloom Deoband, Ashraf Usmani Sahab said, 'allah Ta'ala has made the festival of Eid for the poor and rich
 garibi kii vajah se logon kii khushi main kami naa aae isliye allaah taala ne har sampann musalmaan par jakaat or fitra dena ferj kar diya he
 ' aresas (RSS) ke nagar prachaarak govind ji par tiai dwaara marpet ke aarope par aresas or bijepi ke saikadon kaaryakartaaon ne thane kaa gheraav kar diya or police prashasan ke khilaaf narebaaji shuru kar di
 During this time, the protesters were demanding to suspend police station incharge Anil Kakde and to register a criminal case
 maukey par mahayor shashaank shrivastav or vidhayak sandip jaiswal bhi pahunche
 The RSS has accused the police that the city preacher was badly assaulted in front of the police station while walking on a bicycle

 There is no need to dramatize your kiss inspired by a film or a drama
 agar unhen aapaki kisi bhi harakat main banaavat najar ai to wo hanse bina nahin rah paaengi
 They need to give such deep kiss, so that they realize that your world belongs to them
 kuch der baad aap unhen kis karte karte tham jaaie or unhen nihaariye
 That is until she points you towards her and kisses again

 You should not focus solely on their lips

 While kissing, stop moving your head from one side to the other
 ab jab agali mulaakaat ho to unhen ehsaas hone dijie ki aap unhen kitna pyaar karte hai

 Commercial and political capitals of Gujarat; Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar were settled on the banks of the Sabarmati River
 ek katha yah bhi he ki gujarat sultanate ke sultan ahamed shah ne ek baar sabarmati ke tat par aaraam farmaate vakt ek khargosh ko ek kute kaa peechha karte hue dekha

 But this scenario has also changed in the last few decades

 The first news is that the Sabarmati peta has dried up and now Narmada water flows in this river, not it

 And now there are many events from the International Kite Festival on the banks of this river

 Do you know whether you have noticed the river water or not
 visheshgy kehete hai ki sabarmati main bahane vaala pani atyadhik pradooshit he
 The NGO Environmental Safety Committee and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) have conducted a joint study in this study examining the facts related to the waste falling from industries falling in Sabarmati and the water falling from the sewage treatment plant (STP)
 is saal kii shuruyaat main ai dijastras condishan of sabarmati river naam kii is report main kai khatarnaak sandesh chhipe hai
 The report says that the sewage treatment plant next to the Vasana barrage in Ahmedabad, which has a capacity of 160 million liters per day (MLD), has 139 mg per liter of bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) in the water falling from it
 chemical oxi jan demand (siodi) 337 migra prati litre he or total dissolved solid (tids) kii maatra 732 migra prati litre he
 However, the National Green Authority (NGT) has a standard water BOD of up to 10 mg per liter
 vaise nadi ke pani main sulphate kii maatra 108 migra prati litre or chlorraide kii maatra 186 migra prati litre bataai gai he
 Similarly, when the water of the industry fell in the river ahead of the Vasana barrage, it was found that the amount of bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) in it is 536 mg per liter
 chemical oxikajan demand (siodi) kii maatra 1301 migra prati litre, total dissolved solid (tids) kii maatra 3135 migra prati litre pai gai he
 The quantity of sulfate is 933 mg per liter, while the amount of chloride is 933 mg per liter
 khaas baat he ki industrife kaa chemical yuktam kitna pani rojaanaa sabarmati main gir rahaa he iskaa koi lekha jokha nahin he
 Although stps have been made for the treatment of waste water in Sabarmati, it is creating a different problem
 ek adhyayan yah bhi bataa rahaa he ki in astipi main treetment ke dauraan beemaari paidaa karne vaale sookshmjeev antibiotic dawaaon ke prati pratirodhi kshamta viksit kar lete hai

 Experts believe that this work may have resulted from mutations in the genes of bacteria during sewage treatment during chlorination and ultra-violet radiation
 samasya yah he ki agar bacteria se yah jin transfar kisi alahada or ekadam nai prajati ko janm na de de
 It will be dangerous
 baharhaal, sabarmati nadi kii kokh main pal rahe in sambavit jaivik bamon kii taraf kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he

 Before the election, Modi promised to deposit 15 lakhs in the bank accounts of all the people, which has not been fulfilled
 3
 In this way, the monkey jumps from one tree to another, in the same way Prime Minister Modi makes a second statement after a statement on the note ban

 5
 The country is moving towards dictatorial rule
 6
 Prime Minister Modi has not said any words of condolence regarding the 105 people who died due to bank queues after the currency of currency notes

 If the Prime Minister denies this, then he should claim defamation on Rahul Gandhi
 10
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's protest against the note closure is commendable
 11
 50 days have passed and Prime Minister Modi should find an intersection for himself where he can be punished by the public
 12

 In recent times, college and university campuses in the country have often been in discussion for activities outside their academic circles
 vichaaron or vichaardhaaraon ke takaraav ne kai campason main hinsak rup bhi le liya he
 But this is perhaps a natural process of tilting the balance of political power to one side
 lekin is badlaav ne shaikshanik utkrushtataa kii talash ko prabhavit nahin kiya he
 The results of this year's survey of India Today Group about the best colleges in the country bear witness to this
 tamaam vishyon kii top ten suchi main kai sansthaanon ke sthaayee rup se apni jagah bana lene se yah baat saaf he ki utkrushtataa swabhaav kaa hissaa ban jaati he
 Yes, of course there are some light changes in it
 udhaaharan ke taur par dilli main mahilaon ke ladi shriram college ne humenities se jude vishyon main apni sarvocchata phir se hasil kar lee he
 The college, which topped the recent successful candidates in the prestigious Union Public Service Commission examination, has another reason to celebrate
 yah shiksha main snaatak (bied) kii degree dene vaale collejon main bhi sabase upar he
 This course has been included for the first time in this survey
 pichley teen saal main ubharkar saamne aane vaali kamyaabi kii ek or kahani bangaluru kii christ uniwarsity or dilli ke hansraj college ke sadhe kadamon se nirantar upar kii ore jane kii he
 This deemed private university in Bangalore has secured third place among the three undergraduate academic streams - Arts, Science and Commerce
 iske alaava bibie or bisie ke paathyakramon main vah number van par rahaa he
 Hansraj College, from where Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan has once studied, has finished fifth in science and sixth in arts
 donon main hi usne pichley saal ke naunve sthaan se chalaang lagaai he
 In commerce too, it has climbed up one place to fifth in the list this year
 in alahada kahaniyon ko kinare kar den to survey kii mukhya patakatha lagbhag waisi kii waisi hi rahi he
 in a survey Most of the colleges which have secured respectable place various academic streams in the are confined within the four metros
 haalanki isse desh main ucch shiksha main gaiyr-barabari badhane kaa chintajanak or khatarnaak sanket bhi ujagar hota he
 The most worrying conclusion is that not a single college in Kolkata, the largest city in eastern India, could figure among the top 50 colleges of arts in the country
 haalanki uske teen college vigyaan or commers dhaaraon main top 50 main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahe hai, lekin purvi bharat ke teen anya bade shaharon-guwahati, bhubaneshwar or patna kaa koi bhi college teenon mukhya dhaaraon main se kisi main bhi top 50 main jagah banane main kaamyaab nahin ho paaya he
 Even in the four metros, Delhi topped most streams
 rashtriya rajdhani ke santhaan saat dhaaraon- arts, vigyaan, commers, medicine, fishan, bied or hotel management main awwal hai
 Among the top 50 colleges of Arts, Science and Commerce, 15, 13 and 10 are in Delhi respectively
 ucch shiksha par varsh 2014-15 kii akhil bhartiya surveykshan report kahati he ki dilli main sirf 188 college hai, yani 18-23 ke aayu varg main prayek ek lakh kii aabaadi par sirf nau, jo 27 ke rashtriya ausat se bahut kam he
 This explains the reason for the fierce competition for admission every year among the admission seekers

 The situation is exactly the opposite in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh
 is vishaal rajya main desh main sabase zyada, 5,922 college hai
 Despite this, only three colleges in the state have been ranked among the top 50 colleges in arts, science and commerce
 haalanki takneekee shiksha ke maamle main yah anupaat thodaa behatar he, jahaan top 25 main rajya ke chaar ejineering collejon, teen medical collejon or do lau collejon ko sthaan mila he
 Maharashtra is in a better position in this figure

 According to FICCI, by 2030, India is projected to become the fastest growing economy in the world, touching a size of $ 1 trillion
 iske liye 2030 tak desh ko lagbhag 25 karod kii sakal shramashakti kii jarurat hogi

 But to exploit this possibility, higher education in the country will have to be geographically expanded and become more inclusive

 The process of expansion is gradually starting to take place

 Traditionally top-notch colleges may soon face new challenges

 unke vyaktigat javaabon ko ikattha karke inamen se harek maanak kaa bhaar nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 Experts were then asked to rank colleges in their cities in the streams of Arts, Science and Commerce and in other disciplines for colleges in their region (north, South, East and West)
 kisi tarah ke bhedbhaav se bachane or nishpakshta banaae rakhane ke liye visheshgyon se kaha gaya ki ve apane college kii reating na karen
 After that a second panel of experts was asked to rate the colleges according to their stream according to the national scenario
 visheshgyon ke in do panelon dwaara di gai reating ke anuroop kisi college kaa samgr avadharanatmak score nikaala gaya

 Colleges that refused to provide factual figures or to be included in the survey were not included in the final rankings
 lau ke alaava anya streemon ke liye vishvavidhyalayon ke undergraduate vibhaagon par vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 However, the single colleges which have obtained deemed university status were included in the survey
 dharnagat or tathyaatmak score ko baraabar vajan diya gaya or antim score hasil karne ke liye unhen milaayaa gaya

 The race to become number-1 in terms of subscribers on youtube includes two youtube channels
 kuch maheene se in donon channels main jam kar takkar ho rahi he
 On one side is India's legendary music company t-series and on the other side is the youtube channel pewdiepie of a Swedish video blogger
 taaja sabsakribar base kii baat karen to abhi pewdiepie ke paas 71,939,650 sabsakribar hai, jabaki t-series ke 71,736,543 sabsakribar hai
 That is, the world's number-1 youtube channel is still pewdiepie, but it is expected that t-series will go beyond this and become number-1 youtube channel
 in donon main sabsakribar kaa fark sirf 2 lakh kaa fark rah gaya he
 This happened to the subscribers, but it is not that it is just on youtube
 asal jindagi main donon taraf se phens ek tarah se digital jang lard rahe hai taaki number-1 par bane rahen
 Posters are being put up, promotions are being made, abuses are being given to each other
 mims kii bharmaar lagi he soshal media par
 pewdiepie has been the world's number-1 youtube channel for many years
 lekin ab bhartiya mujeec channel tii-siries number-1 par kabiz hone ke liye teji se bad rahaa he or aise main soshal media par logon ne ise bharat or duusare desh kii ladaai bana di he
 People are constantly promoting on social media to make the t-series channel number-1
 pewdiepie kii baat karen to is channel ke liye aid campaning kii ja rahi he taaki yah number-1 bana rahe
 The entire city is flooded with pewdiepie advertising
 tivi, radio or bilbords har taraf aid ke liye jam kar paise kharch kiye ja rahe hai
 People are being asked to subscribe to it and pewdiepie benefited from it and subscribers grew rapidly
 bhartiya yugers jinhone pewdiepie channel dekha he wo gussa hai
 The reason for this is that they do a lot of evil in their videos in India
 isaki shaayad vajah ye bhi ho sakati he ki number-1 kaa taj bhartiya mujeec company chhinane kii taiyaari main he
 It is interesting that the videos in which he has said bad about India that those videos have become more hits, in such a situation, it is also a fact that he is making more similar videos in this affair
 video vyuj ke maamle main t-series ne pehle hi pewdiepie ko peeche chhod diya he
 Because t-series videos have been viewed 53 billion times, while pewdiepie videos have 19 billion views

 Now this time Sushant himself is not there but due to him two more artists are in the news
 ham baat kar rahe hai sushant singh rajput kii eks garlfriend kriti senon or sara ali khan kii
 Both these actresses were once girlfriends of Sushant
 is baar mauka tha star screen aword kaa or stage par saath aa khadi hui sushant kii donon eks garlfriend sara or kriti
 Now old experiences show that if two x collide with each other, then there is a commotion
 nae vivaad to khadey hote hi hai
 But this time it has seen something different
 donon actress ek stage par takaraayi bhi, or phir saath main dance bhi kiya
 This is rarely seen in the Bollywood industry
 lekin star screen aword par ye sab dekhne ko mila he
 Kriti and Sara did a dance with Hrithik, in fact, Hrithik Roshanko was called on the stage to dance
 dance bhi unhen apni hi blockbster film war ke ganeghungrupar karnaa tha
 Now because Hrithik was not to dance alone on stage, he immediately invited Kriti Sanon and Sara Ali Khan
 iske baad to jo hua sabhi ne dekha

 Although neither of them has officialized their relationship
 bataa den, sushant singh rajput haali hi main film drive main dikhe the
 It was released on Netflix

 Apart from this, several states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab have declared a day off

 There is no one like Atal
 
 
 atal bihari vaajapeyi desh kii sakriy raajnneeti main paanch dashak se zyada samay tak rahe
 He was the first non-congress Prime Minister of the country
 unhone apana pehla loksabhaa chunaav 1952 main ladaa, haalanki pehali jeet unhen 1957 main mili
 From then until 2009, he remained in parliamentary politics continuously
 1977 main ve pehali baar mantri bane, jabaki 1996 main ve 13 din ke liye pradhanmantri bhi rahe
 However, in 1998, he again got the chance to become PM
 unki ye sarkaar bhi sirf 13 maheene chali lekin iske baad hue loksabhaa chunaav main endie gathbandhan ke bahumat vaali sarkaar bani or vaajapeyi ne piem ke rup main apana kaarykaal puraa kiya
 He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Lucknow in 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2004
 november 1885 main kalakatta ke tat se jab eses inds jahaaj ne yatra shuru kii to usamen nil or bhartiya chaay pattiyon ke gatthar to bhare hi the, saath hi isa purv teesri shatabdi ke kuch virale murtishilp kaa khajaana bhi bharaa tha, jise bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan (ees) ke pehle pramukh sar elexander kaningham ne khud jatan se jutaya tha
 Bharhut sculptures were obtained by Cunningham after several rounds of excavations from a Buddhist monastery in Madhya Pradesh and were being taken to London for an exhibition
 kareeb 3,462 ton vajani yah jahaaj 8 november 1885 ko madras se dakshin kii ore colombo ke raste main tha tabhi nauvahan kii ek galati ke kaaran dub gaya
 During the tide, SS Indus somehow crossed the sand heap and then an anchor of his own knocked him down
 us lungar kii vajah se jahaaj ke tal main chhed ho gaya or kuch hi ghanton main vah dub gaya
 No one was killed in this accident but the goods and furnishings could not be saved
 usamen amuly murtishilpon ke alaava kaningham kaa pracheen mudraon kaa nijee sangrrah bhi tha
 Nearly a hundred and fifty years after that accident, geologists in India and Sri Lanka have decided to launch a joint operation to take out that treasure hidden in the ocean floor

 yah jagah mulativu ke najadik sthit he, jahaan ek samay altitii kaa raaj hua karata tha
 According to ASI officials, there has been an agreement to launch a joint campaign with Sri Lanka to remove the sea-sculpted sculpture and Sudarshan Seneviratne, Sri Lanka's High Commissioner to India, is taking a keen interest in it himself

 a memorandum of understanding is being prepared for a joint sea digging campaign and work on it is expected to start soon after the approval of the Ministry of External Affairs
 ”pichhali sadi main eses inds kii talash trinkomali ke aasapaas hi hoti rahi he
 The ship is believed to have sunk 40 meters below sea level to the north of Trincomalee
 lekin 2009 main grihayuddh khatm hone ke baad srilanka ke adhikariyon ne mulativu ke aasapaas khojbin shuru kii, jahaan pehle altitii ke kabje kii vajah se janaa sambhav nahin tha
 Nandadas's report on the search for the ship rejected the presumption of the wreck being "in the foothills of the sea 50 miles north of Trikomali", as well as specifically mentioning Mullaitivu in the search
 report main kaha gaya he, “barason purana hone ke kaaran malba kaaphi bikhar chukaa hoga
 
 
 It lies on the sand floor
 
 
 malba notical chart par lagaae gaye chinh se kareeb do mile dur he

 His descriptions are also present in inscriptions next to the statues in ancient Bharhut, from the Sanchi Stupas and the frescoes of Ajanta

 He took many shapes and sculptures with him to Calcutta, where he was kept in the Indian Museum
 bharhut mandir parisar ke baaki khandhiron ke bare main adhik jaankaree maujuud nahin he
 There were also earlier a huge statue of Buddha, some Sanskrit inscriptions and idols of deities
 mana jaataa he ki inamen se anek kalakritiyaan eses inds main ladi thim, jo dub gayi
 The steam-powered passenger ship SS Indus was built in 1871
 britain ke rashtriya saamudrik sangrahalay ke record main darj he ki april 1881 kii janaganana ke dauraan yah jahaaj landan bandargah par khadaa tha
 According to museum records, there were 17 shipwrecks from Goa on it

 But Shilpa still has three strong contenders playing together
 vikaas ne hina or akaash ke saath baatcheet main yahaan tak kaha ki shilpa ko aisa koi mauka nahin dena he jisase wo ro kar chimpathy len
 This maneuver against Vikas and others against Shilpa can prove beneficial to 'bhabi Ji'

 Last night Manoj Tiwari expressed who is the bjp's boss in Delhi, amid reports of internal discord and mutual tension in the Delhi BJP
 ashoka road par manoj tiwari ne party kii kor cameti kii baithak bulaai or usamen chuninda netaaon ko bulaayaa gaya
 All Delhi mps and former Delhi BJP Presidents were called to this meeting
 haalanki pradesh bijepi ke duusare netaaon ko is baithak se dur rakhaa gaya
 It is believed that Tiwari is trying to show that there should be no misunderstanding about his lack of experience in the organization
 darasal, upi chunaav main vyast rahane ke daurandilli bijepike kuch netaaon ne kor group banaakar emsidi chunaav ke liye ummidavaar chayan kii prakriya shuru kar di thi
 Tiwari was angered by this and immediately called a meeting of the party's core core committee
 jisamen kathith kor group ke netaaon ko nahin bulaakar or ye jataa diya gaya ki faisla lene or use lagu karne ke liye adhyaksh ko darkinar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 After a close look at the politics of Delhi, in a special conversation from Delhi till date, Manoj Tiwari said that he is definitely away from Delhi for campaigning, but not different from Delhi
 wo dilli kii raajnneeti par paini nazar rakhe hue hai
 Going to the slums and listening to the complaints and problems of the people
 isiilie party main jhagade kii khabaren aam aadmi party or congress ke log failaa rahe hai
 Tiwari argued behind the call of the core committee meeting that the committee had not met for a long time in the party and work was being done through a variety of committees
 isliye hamane asli kor cameti jisamen 13 sadsy hai, uski baithak bulaai
 All members came to the meeting
 rashtriya sanghathan mantri raamalaal bhi is baithak main maujuud the
 Although Tiwari avoided the question of interference in Shyam Jaju's day-to-day functioning, he said that the one who should have come to the meeting was called
 tiwari ne kaha ki is baithak main na sirf emsidi chunaav se judi ranneeti banaai gai, balki aam aadmi party ke ghotaalon kii pole kholane kii bhi charchaa hui
 But the question is why Manoj Tiwari needed to call a core committee meeting late at night
 kahin aisa to nahin ki darkinar kiye jane kii koshish ke baad ab manoj tiwari ye jataana or bataanaa chaahate hai ki dilli main party ke bos ab vahi hai or party main unki marzi chalegi

 If the driver is canceled on behalf of the driver, then the customer should be given a penalty of `25 per cent on the price of penalty across the country
 By writing a letter to the taxi aggregators, they have demanded a ban on arbitrariness in the name of surge pricing
 SJM ne chitthee main kaha he ki sarj prising par 25 fisadi cap lagaaya jaae
 Doing so will prevent taxi aggregators from charging arbitrary fares in the name of peak hours
 chitthee main ye maang bhi kii gai he ki taxi ap company kii ore se agar ride cancel kii jaati he to company par dand lagaaya janaa chahie
 SJM has expressed surprise that an app based taxi aggregator charges a penalty if a ride is canceled on behalf of the customer but no compensation is paid to the customer if the ride is canceled by himself or the driver
 SJM ke rashtriya sah sanyojak dow ashvini mahajan ne india today ko bataaya, ‘sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay (morth) motor whical act 2019 ke tahat ap aadhaarit taxi agrigaters ke liye niyam banane kii prakriya main he, aise main hamane mantri se aagrah kiya he ki niyam logon ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaae jaaen
 'dr
 Mahajan also warned the ministry that if public interest is not taken into consideration, there will be resentment among the people and states can come up with their own separate rules for taxi aggregators
 sadak parivahan mantri ko likhi chitthee main SJM ne mukhya taur par chaar maang uthaai hai-1- sarj prising par puure desh main adhik se adhik 25% kaa cap lagaaya janaa chahie
 2- If the ride is canceled by the taxi app or the driver, then 100 rupees or 20% of the fare should be credited to the customer's account
 3- ap aadhaarit taxi agrigaters ko advance yaa sheduld booking ke vakt sarj prising kii ijazat nahin di jaae
 4- Custom service and app features should be upgraded in such a way that we can easily talk to the customer service center if there is an emergency or need
 dow
 Mahajan told India Today, it has been seen that taxi aggregators like Uber and Ola, who started work in 2014-15 in the name of low fares and convenient taxi service, have now started profiteering in the name of surge pricing

 Mahajan said that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is in the process of framing rules for aggregators
 media reports main kaha gaya he ki mantralay vichaar kar rahaa he ki sarj priceing main saadhaaran kiraye se teen guna adhik tak liye jane ko manzuri di jaae
 The same was stated in the guidelines issued by the Ministry in December 2016
 aise main hamaara aagrah he ki motor whical act 2019 ke tahat taxi agrigaters ke liye niyam banaate vakt janhit ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae

 Under the rule, on the appeal of the fielding team, if the umpire feels that the batsman makes a big change in his direction without taking a run, then it hinders the fielding's attempt to run him out and the batsman Out should be given to obstruct fielding
 yah myne nahin rakhata ki vah ran out ho rahaa tha yaa nahin
 The ICC said, 'it is also possible that the batsman is given out for obstructing the fielding in such a situation while he did not make much difference in his direction during the run, provided the umpire is clear that the batsman has somehow fielding Tried to create a deadlock
 ’ is faisle ko lene main maidani ampire tisare ampire kii madad le sakate hai lekin antim faisla maidani ampire legaa or ballebaaj ko batayega
 Apart from this, the new rule related to Powerplay in the 50-over format will also be effective

 The start of the innings will be mandatory with the first ten overs of the power play while the second and third powerplays cannot be taken before 16 overs and will have to be finished by 40 overs

 Also in any format of cricket the batsman will not get a runner
 ’ ghayal yaa biimaar ballebaaj ke paas ritred hart ho kar baad main waapas aane kaa vikalp hoga
 It cannot be an option in the event of nine wickets falling
 gendbaaji chor par khadey ballebaaj ko gendbaaj dwaara gendbaaji ke dauraan ran out karne ko lekar bhi isisi ne naye niyam jari kiya he
 Under this rule, the bowler will be allowed to attempt to run out the batsman standing on the running provided he has not bowled and has not completed his normal bowling action
 yah prayaas safal rahe yaa nahin, gend ko nahin gina jayega
 If the bowler's attempt fails, the umpire should call it 'dead ball' as soon as possible
 ampiron se ab agar koi bhi captain lunch yaa chaay ke vishram se pehle 15 minute (nunatam chaar over) ke atirikt khel kaa aagrah karata he to vah is par faisla kar sakate he lekin tabhi jab unhen lage ki is satr main nishchit taur par nateeja aa jayega
 If the umpires feel that the result cannot be achieved then no extra time will be given

 In a one-day ODI match, the interval between innings has been increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes
 vahiin kai log ye bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki jab upwas kaa samay 10 baje se nirdhaarit tha to congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi paune ek baje ke kareeb rajghat kyon pahunche
 Overall, this nationwide fast of the Congress is now surrounded by controversies
 isse pehle rajghat main hi rahul ke pahunchane se pehle congress netaa jagadish titalar or sajjan kumaar ke manch par pahunch jane se bhi bavaal ho gaya tha
 Significantly, today the Congress is fasting across the country on the issue of atrocities on Dalits, not allowing Parliament to run, and communal harmony
 ashok gahalot kii taraf se party ke sabhi pradesh adhyakshon, eisisi mahasachivon / prabhariyon or vidhayak dal ke netaaon ke bheje gaye disha nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki sampradayik sauhaard ko bachaane or badhaane ke liye sabhi rajyon or jilon ke congress mukhyalayon main 9 april ko upwas rakhaa jaae
 At the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party on Friday, it was decided to ask the BJP mps to fast on the 12th against the discriminatory policies of the Congress
 daliton ke maamle main jis tarah ke tool pakadaa or bharat band ke dauraan jo hinsa hui uske peeche bijepi vipaksh ko zimmedaar tehra rahi he
 It is clear that both the Congress and the BJP are trying to stand up for the Dalits in their own way through fasting
 gauratlab he ki aaj congress daliton par atyaachaar, sansad na chalane dene or sampradayik sauhaard ke mudde par puure desh main anshan kar rahi he
 The guidelines sent by Ashok Gehlot to all party state presidents, AICC general secretaries / in-charge and legislative party leaders said that fasting on April 9 at Congress headquarters in all states and districts to protect and enhance communal harmony Be kept
 vahiin beete shuukravaar ko bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main faisla liya gaya ki bijepi saansadon se kaha ki ve congress kii vibhedakaari nitiyon ke khilaaf 12 tarikh ko upwas rakhen
 The BJP is blaming the opposition for the kind of violence that took place in the case of Dalits and the violence that took place during the Bharat Bandh
 jaahir he congress or bijepi donon upwas ke zarie apane apane tareeqe se daliton ke haq main khadaa dikhne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Frustrated by the success of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government at the Center and frustrated, the Congress suffers from deep depression
 party or uske netaa yah samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki is avsaad kii avasthaa main wo desh ke samaksh kaise ek jimmedaar raajnneetik dal kii bhoomika nibhaayen
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is unable to understand even the difference between anti-national and national interest in this frustration
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) main jo kuch bhi hua use kahin se bhi desh hit ke daayre main rakhkar nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 In a reputed university of the country, anti-national slogans and terrorists should have open support, no citizen can accept this
 lekin congress upaadhyaksh or unki party ke anya netaaon ne jeenyu jaakar jo bayaan die hai unhone ek baar phir sabit kar diya he ki unki soch main rashtrahit jaisi bhaavana kaa koi sthaan nahin he
 In JNU, a handful of leftist-inspired students shouted the following anti-national slogans: • “pakistan jindabad” • "go India Go Back" • “bharat kii barabaadi tak jang rahegi jari” • "war on Kashmir will continue till independence" • “afazal ham sharminda he tere kaatil zindaa hai” • "how many Afzal will you die, Afzal will come out of every house" • “afazal tere khun se inkalab aayegaa” By justifying these students, which democratic system is Rahul Gandhi advocating

 i want to ask them that by supporting these slogans have they joined hands with the separatist forces of the country?

Are you not promoting anti-national powers by taking a sit-in in support of such anti-nationals? jeenyu main rahul gandhi ne vartmaan bharat kii tulana hitler ke germany se kar daali

 One of the main reasons for the bjp's defeat in the three states that were in power was the two-way beating of anti-incumbency trends
 rajya sarkaron ke khilaaf naaraazgi kii kaat ke liye bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par daanv chalaa
 But with his popularity, Modi came to the polls with the burden of anti-incumbency against the central government in the last four and a half years, which benefited the Congress
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki, 2014 ke baad jin rajyon main chunaav hue vahaan bhaajapa ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 Bihar and Delhi are exceptions and the bjp's presence in Kerala, Puducherry, Punjab and Tamil Nadu has not been significant
 yahaan tak ki isi saal ke madhya main karnataka chunaav main bhi bhaajapa sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari lekin chunaav baad jedies or congress ne mil kar sarkaar bana di or bhaajapa ko roak diya
 But the mandate was given by the people of Karnataka in support of Modi and BJP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad, chunaav dar chunaav main bhaajapa jeet hasil karti gai
 One important reason for this is that with the popularity of Modi, the BJP overthrew its rival parties in the elections
 modi kii majboot netaa kii chhavi, amit shah ke kushal chunaav prabandhan or satta main baithe virdohi dalon ke khilaaf jamaa hue sattavirohi rujhaan bhaajapa kii jeet tay karti gai
 But when the BJP entered the elections in those states where the party itself was in government, the party which was in opposition there was not in power
 isliye apni sarkaar ko dephend karne main dikkat pesh ai
 This was clearly indicated in the Gujarat elections
 bhaajapa yahaan apni sarkaar bachaane main badi mushkil se safal hui or pehali baar satta main dahaai aankadon ke saath aane par majaboor hona padaa
 The BJP itself was in power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 rajasthan main paanch saal se or anya donon rajyon main 15 saal se
 The local leadership was trying its best to bridge the anti-incumbency trend in these two states, but when the BJP leaders started mentioning the achievements of the central government in a big way in the elections, then the anti-incumbency trends gathered against the central state Anti-incumbency trends gathered against the governments and this trend proved to be decisive
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ke ek purv mantri or bhaajapa netaa kehete hai ki chunaav main congress kii taraf se sthaneey sarkaar ke khilaaf jitne aarope lagaae gaye usase do-guna se adhik aarope centre sarkaar ke khilaaf lagaae gaye
 Issues such as Rafael, Demonetisation, GST were the main election slogans of anti-parties
 centre or rajya donon ke sattavirohi rujhaan jab ekajute ho jaaen to phir jeetna kaaphi kathin ho jaataa he
 This happened and BJP could not win in all three states
 teenon rajya nikalne se bhaajapa ki chintaa sirf yaheen tak nahin he
 It will be a big challenge for 2019 as well
 kyonki centre main bhaajapa kii sarkaar he or zyaadaatar rajyon main bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar he
 In such a situation, when the anti-incumbency trends of the states are added to the anti-incumbency trend against the central government, then it will be a big challenge
 yadi bhaajapa is samasya kaa kaat nahin talash pai to 2019 kii raah kathin he
 *** chunaav ayog ne soshal netwarking site fasebuk se desh main matdaan se 48 ghante pehle raajnneetik vigyaapan hataane ke liye kaha he
 Although Facebook has not yet responded to this, it is considering it now
 gauratlab he ki cambridge analitica maamle main fasebuk kaa naam saamne aane or isse america main chunaav prabhavit hone kii ghatana ke baad duniyabar main soshal media ke chunaav main durupyog ko rokane ke prayaas ho rahe hai
 a committee was formed by the Election Commission of India in this regard
 samiti kii chaar june kii baithak main janpratinidhitiv kanoon- 1951 kii dhara -126 par vichaar kiya gaya
 At the meeting, facebook's representative agreed that he would consider providing a window or button on his page on which the complaints of election laws could be reported
 fasebuk ke pratinidhi ne is baat par bhi sahmati jataai ki uske yugers dwaara post kii jane vaali contate kii samiksha karne waalon kii sankhya maujuuda 7,500 se adhik bhi kii ja sakati he
 This number can be changed at the time of election
 janpratinidhitiv adhinium kii dhara -126 matdaan se 48 ghante pehle kisi bhi tarah ke chunaav prachaar ko pratibandhit karti he taaki matadaata ko nirnay karne kaa samay mil sake
 The Facebook representative said in the meeting that complaints against content could be made on the Facebook page itself and would be reviewed in accordance with international standards
 yadi yah content antarrashtriya maanakon kaa ulanghan karne vaali pai jaati he jo ise fasebuk ke pej se hataa diya jayega
 On the other hand, if the Election Commission or its employees complain about the violation of the rules regarding any content, then it will be decided expeditiously
 (input-bhashaa) Recall that moment when your partner is rushing to join you in arms, but he has left you in agony after being annoyed by some small thing about you
 kya kai baar aapkaa saathi aapaki choti-choti baton par ukhd jaataa he, bhale hi vah pehle kitna hi mood main kyon na ho? agar aisa he, to janaab galati unki nahin, aapaki he
 Knowingly or unknowingly, we often say such things, which make the partner uprooted
 aisa agali baar apane saath katai na hone den
 Say things differently, if your partner is unable to go on a date with you due to lack of time, then do not complain to him
 shikaayat na karne kaa matlab yah katai nahin he ki aap apni pareshaani unke saath baante hi nahin
 Say her mind, of course, but instead of saying that you don't like her going on a date with you, say that if she goes on a date with you, then that time will surely be very beautiful for her
 baat, jo kabhi na puuchhen
 
 
 Never question your partner whether he is of any gotra, religion, or caste
 yah baat unhen aapse kaaphi dur kar sakati he
 No one will be able to take these questions easily in the moments of proximity
 is ke saath hi kuch duusari baaten bhi poochne yaa kehane se parhez karen
 Like, do you like music? Have we never met before? I'm not that kind of guy, etc

 Be clever if you think that by complimenting your partner's trousers or pants, they will realize that you have thoughts of beds in your mind, then you are thinking completely wrong
 kapadon kii tarif se vah yahi andaja lagaayengi ki aap shopping ke mood main hai, isliye trouger kii tarif karne ke bajaae un kii body shape kii tarif karen or kahen ki un ke pairon par vah trouger fab rahaa he
 Say goodbye to questions
 If she is feeling with you, then feel her too
 bajaae bekaar ke sawaal poochne ke
 Never ask questioning childish or personal things, like if she is divorced, then obviously she will not want to talk about this issue at all and you will have many questions about her
 par man ke sawaalon ko man ke bheetar hi dabaa den, kyonki baahar aane par vah manmutav kii sthiti bana sakate hai
 Forget the old things, you may also have a past
 kabhi pehle aapaki koi premika rahi ho, lekin jo biit chukaa he use apane vartmaan main na laaen
 Never compare your partner to an old girlfriend
 tum bahut patali ho
 
 
 Some women are extremely thin
 ho saktaa he ki yah baat aapako akharati ho, lekin bhuulakar bhi yah baat unase na kahen ki vah behad patali dikhti hai
 Yes, if you want to convey your mind to them, then you can say something like this, 'nowadays, you have kept your fashion of zero size
 yah aap par fabtaa he, lekin yakeen maniye aap thode fat ke saath zyada acchhee lagengi
 'women do not like the comments made on their bodies at all

 With the clever captaincy and tight bowling of Harbhajan Singh, Mumbai successfully defended their low score and defeated Bangalore by 31 runs to win the title of Champions League Twenty20 cricket tournament
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 To take part, when the team of Mumbai were reduced to 139 runs in 20 overs, then the match of Bangalore seemed heavy on the match

 Bangalore's team finally 19

 Chidambaram called his office and discussed the possibilities of nuclear testing
 karyaalay sanbhaalane ke baad itani jaldi parmaanu mudde par aage badaae ke vaajapeyi ke faisle se log hairaan rah gaye
 Very few people knew that he had ordered a nuclear test in his first term as Prime Minister in May 1996, but that decision had to be canceled after his government fell within 13 days
 unhen 1998 main bhi yah baat kachot rahi thi
 Vajpayee was well aware that he was leading a fragile coalition government and time was running out
 isliye unhone teji dikhaai
 When Kalam and Chidambaram were brought to his office, Vajpayee was sitting behind his desk
 chidambaram meeting ke liye apane saath plastic shit par kuch diagram bana kar laae the
 Vajpayee also called Brajesh Mishra, who was appointed his chief secretary, the previous afternoon
 chidambaram sidhe mudde par aa gaye
 He told Vajpayee that since the last briefing given to him as Prime Minister in 1996, since then, the team has been in a position to make hydrogen bombs
 vaajapeyi yah sunakar bade khush hue
 Then through illustration, Chidambaram explained the difference between atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb
 lekin jab parmaanu urja pramukh bahut zyada vistaar main jane lage to vaajapeyi thode anmane-se dikhe
 Then he turned to Kalam and asked, how many days will it take? Kalam's reply was, "sir, t minus 30 days
 ''jab vaajapeyi kuch bhramit-se lage to kalam muskaraae or bataaya ki iskaa matlab pareekshan kaa aadesh paarit hone vaale din se agle 30 dinon se he
 Vajpayee asked them to start preparing for the test and ended the meeting saying that Vajpayee would tell them when they would pass the order
 is bich, pradhanmantri ne mishra se parmaanu pareekshan ke prabhaavon kaa akalan karne or antarrashtriya pratibandhon se nibatane kii ranneeti taiyaar karne ko kaha
 a few days later, Mishra told Vajpayee the situation
 unhone kaha ki pareekshanon kii jameen pichhali sarkaron dwaara pehle hi taiyaar kii ja chuki he
 The strategic situation around India had deteriorated
 ab pakistan samet kai desh mixilon se las the, ve sambhawatah missile parmaanu hathiyaar dhone vaali kshamta se bhi las the, jo bharat ke liye khatra paidaa kar sakate the
 Also, with the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996, the door to nuclear testing for India was rapidly closing
 sandhi kii samiksha sitambar main honi tay thi jisamen bharat ke is sandhi par hastakshar kii baat uthati
 Discussing the difficulties, Mishra said that the foreign exchange reserves are high, economic growth has declined and recession is coming
 isaki bhi ashanka thi ki america bharat par chautarafa pratibandhon kii ghoshnaa karegaa or khadi deshon par bharat ko tel nahin dene kaa dabaav banayega
 But for India's security, it will be a huge achievement in terms of being a nuclear power country
 agar bharat ko pareekshan ke baad aane vaale tufaan kaa saamana karnaa he to use isaki taiyaari ke liye chah maheene chahie
 Vajpayee listened to Mishra carefully and quietly
 ve us faisle kaa bhaar mahasoos kar rahe the jo ve lene vaale the
 From his experience of so many years, Vajpayee had mastered reaching the root of any problem without feeling the burden of mountains without arguments
 unke soch main sidhaapan tha jo unhen teji se nirnay lene main madad karata tha
 They believed that if India were to achieve greatness, it would have to be powerful militarily
 unhone apane ek sahyogi se kaha tha, "hamen raksha main aatmanirbhar hona he
 We cannot leave our defense to others hoping that they will come and help
 ''vaajapeyi kai virodhabhaason vaale vyakti the
 He also loved to call himself the Messiah of Peace
 unki kavitaaon main yah ichha jhalkati he
 Years before the trial, he had written a poignant poem Jung Dont Let Jung, calling for peace between Pakistan and India: love or strike
 
 
 khun ek hi bahna he / / jo ham par gujri he / bacchon ke sang na hone denge
 Yet after the 1998 tests, many people were of the opinion that Vajpayee had brought the region to the brink of a disastrous nuclear conflict
 main bharat ke parmaanu bam ke itihaas par ek kitaab likh rahaa tha, isliye pareekshan ke baad maine vaajapeyi se milane ke liye samay maanga
 i asked him many questions, one of which was that since he had always been giving the message of peace restoration, while deciding the nuclear test, did he have any ideological duality like Arjuna of Mahabharata
 kuch palon kii khamoshi ke baad unhone apane chir-pirichat andaaj main kaha, "bahut zyada sochane kii jarurat nahin thi
 We just had to complete it
 '' baad main ek samaaroh main apni kavitaaon kii ek audio ricarding jari karte hue unhone ise spasht kiya, "yah virodhabhasi prathit ho saktaa he ki ek vyakti jo shanti kii kavitaayen likhata he, usne parmaanu bam visphot karaayaa
 There may have been contradictions, but i can assure you that there was no contradiction
 ''paristhitiyaan aisi thim ki vaajapeyi ke liye acchhee sthiti banati gai
 The rss's sentiment regarding the atomic bomb would be the eyes of the fundamentalists with this explosion, given the militant nationalism and Vajpayee's throne would eradicate his fears of weakening his agenda
 vaajapeyi samajhate the ki parmaanu hathiyaar kshamta or takat ke pratik the or isse bharat ko garv karne ko kuch milegaa
 Some of the aura that came out of the test was definitely associated with his personality and he would have wiped out his image of the dilemma leader in a jolt
 11 may, 1998 pareekshan kaa din tay kiya gaya
 That day he had called four people to his official residence on Race Course Road in Delhi — Home Minister LK Advani, Defense Minister George Fernandes, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Jaswant Singh
 un sabhi ko rajasthan main pokaran range se aane vaali khabar kaa besabri se intjaar tha
 He sat quietly on chairs around the Prime Minister's dining table as it was a few hours late from the scheduled time for the test
 kalam ne aakhirkaar pokaran se pareekshan kii safalataa kii khabar dene ke liye mishra ko phone kiya
 Mishra narrated the news to Vajpayee and the cabinet ministers sitting around him
 pradhanmantri ke chehre par sukhad muskaan fail gai
 Later, Vajpayee told me, "it is difficult to describe the moment, but i was experiencing satisfaction and happiness at that time
" '' khabar sunate hi furnandis or adwani kii ankhon main khushi ke aansu chhalak aae the
 The ministers shook hands with each other and left
 vaajapeyi tab apane ghar se baahar aae jahaan aanan-fanan main bulaae gaye press reporters unki pratiksha kar rahe the
 a few minutes earlier, his trusted aide Pramod Mahajan had put the Indian flag in the backdrop, especially in the backdrop, showing the wisdom
 vaajapeyi ne ek sankshipt bayaan padhaa jisamen kaha gaya tha ki parmaanu pareekshan safal rahe or unhone vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron ko is uplabdhi par badhai di
 Indicating a significant change from Indira Gandhi's statement after the 1974 eruption, of which Vajpayee later described himself, he did not use the word "peaceful" to describe the nuclear explosions
 do din baad 13 may ko pokaran main bharat ne do or safal pareekshan kiye par is baar inaki tivrata kam thi
 Showing no hesitation in commenting on India's nuclear situation, Vajpayee explained in an interview to India Today: "we do not want to cover our action with an unnecessary cover of hesitation
 bharat ab parmaanu hathiyaar sampann raashtra he lekin hamaara iraadaa hameshaa shantipurna rahaa he or aage bhi rahegaa
 In retaliation a fortnight after India's 1998 explosion, when Pakistan also conducted six nuclear tests, Vajpayee was confident that tensions between the two countries would now subside
 unhone apane ek sahyogi se kaha, "ab jabaki donon deshon ne jataa diya he ki donon hi parmaanu hathiyaarasampann hai, ham yuddh main jane kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate
 This will bring us closer to each other and open the way for cooperation
 ''vaajapeyi sahi or galat donon rahe honge
 Nine months later, on 20 February 1999, he made history by traveling from bus to Lahore for a summit with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to find ways to reduce tensions between the two countries and reduce the possibility of nuclear war
 
 laga ki ek badi safalataa mil gai he
 But Pakistan strangled the trust within a few months
 may main pakistani sena ne niyantran rekha paar kar kargil kii ahm chotiyon par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan began to threaten that if India declared a full war, it would not back down from using nuclear weapons
 is bich, america or kai anya europea deshon ne pareekshan ke kaaran bharat or pakistan ke khilaaf kade pratibandh laga die
 Vajpayee was ready for this
 unhone kaha, "mujhe bharosa tha ki deshvasi parmaanu pareekshan ke kaaran desh ke saamne aane vaali kisi bhi chunauti kaa saamana karne main samarth the
 The economy was in a fundamentally strong position and i believe that our people are ready to make any sacrifice when it comes to the security of the country
 '' unka akalan sahi tha
 Indicating reconciliation in 2000, the US lifted restrictions on India and President Bill Clinton made his first visit to India — the first US president to do so in two decades
 parmaanu pareekshanon ko lekar vaajapeyi kii spashtataa, drudh vishwaas or saahas ke kaaran desh ke parmaanu itihaas main unka naam amar rahegaa
 In 2005 his successor, Dr
 manmohan singh ke bharat-america naagarik parmaanu samjhaute par hastakshar ke baad bharat ke khilaaf laga parmaanu bhedbhaav puri tarah khatm ho gaya
 Thatwajpayee said, "it is difficult for me to explain that moment, but i felt contented and happy

 padhie unki baat, unheen kii jubaani
 You are involved in social issues, are you a political man? Aamir: Yes, to some extent
 jab tak har insaan political na ho jaae, yah desh puri tarah badalegaa nahin
 Here everyone does not mean to contest elections
 masalaa saamaajik rup se jaagruk hone kaa he, taaki ham sahi faisle le saken
 My stage is cinema, by staying here i can bring change with my forces
 lekin main politics main nahin jaaunga
 Talking about the family
 
 
 aajkal mere bete aaazaad kaa play skool shuru ho gaya he
 He grabs my feet while leaving
 to phir main god main uthaa letaa hum
 i always felt that i could spend less time with children
 ye sochate-sochate 25 saal guzar gaye
 Then it seems that perhaps i am such a person that i am so lost in work that i cannot give as much time to my important relationships
 ab ye sweekaar karne kaa vakt aa gaya he ki main thodaa self-centared aadmi hum
 But i feel that i am a good father and a good husband
 aapaki jo filmein flop raheen unka kya?kai baar aisa ho jaataa he
 When i watch old and flop films, i think i have learned the most from these films
 jo bananaa chaahate the
 Could not make that
 ye bahut kuch sikhaa detaa he
 Wife Kiran watches your films? Yes Kiran was in her course when she studied in Jamia
 uske pehle unhone 'qayaamat se qayaamat tak' dekhi thi, dekh dekh kar uski casette ghisa di thi
 The sensitivity of Kiran and my cinema is different, but not as different as it seems
 ab jaise 'taare jameen par', jab hamane banaai thi to itnaa andaja nahin tha ki vah is kadar lokapriy ho jaaegi
 But it happened
 par meraa tag commercial kaa zyada rahata he
 i have been working for so many years that i am able to take different stories on a platform where more and more people can see them
 jaise pipli live he yaa talash he
 Is it not a government advertisement to endorse the government? Absolutely not
 incredibal india kaa vigyaapan karne kaa matlab yah nahin he ki main sarkaar ko bhi indorse kar rahaa hum
 It is a matter of country
 koi ghoomane aae to bharat kii buree chhavi lekar na jaae
 i am doing the same thing about UNICEF and malnutrition
 umr kya sirf number he
 
 
 Yes? main agle saal march main 49 saal kaa ho jaaoongaa
 hj my mind is curious
 main jaananaa chahta hum
 It seems from the inside that i am 18-19
 kai baar umradraj aadmi ko ankal bol detaa hum to wo palatakar jawaab de detaa he ki tumse chota hum
 But yes, i still think of myself as young
 aajkal ke yangsters kii kya approach he aapaki raay main?pataa nahin
 i remain so lost in my work
 par haa ek cheez he
 i see the youngsters of today who are doing the first film
 tab lagata he ki yaar ye pehali film main hi itnaa acha kar rahaa he
 Then i miss my start, then i think how far behind i was
 yang zyada dianmik hai
 Question of Khan Rivalry
 
 
 dekhie main apane liye jawaab de saktaa hum
 i have no negative thoughts for anyone
 iske liye main apni ammi kaa shukraguzaar hum
 This is how he was raised
 to jab kisi kaa kaam pasand aata he, to khushi hoti he
 It doesn't happen to me how man did it work well
 maine kyun nahin kiya
 When i was younger and i used to play matches, Ammi used to ask, won or lost? i say won, then she would hug
 phir kahatee ki betaa aaj jo haara hoga usase bhi uski ammi ne aise hi poocha hoga, lekin usne jawaab diya hoga ki vah haar gaya he
 Then i think that i had made a mistake by defeating him
 to ammi kii parvarish aisi thi
 When i see someone's work, like i saw Sanju's work in Munnabhai, it was so much fun
 jab maine ranbir kaa kaam dekha, barfi main, to bahut acha laga
 How can the competition feel in this? unke achche kaam se main bura kaise ho jaaoongaa
 What is the reason for this thinking? 
 
 ?bachapan main tennis bahut kheltaa tha
 Was quite good
 maharashtra main sab junior main rank player tha
 Tense lived before the match
 neend nahin aati thi
 If the match came into play, Ammi would have won or lost
 aam taur par jawaab haa hota, vah gale lagaati, phir das minute baad puuchhati, jo ladkaa tumse haara he, vah bhi is vakt ghar pahunchaa hoga
 His mother must have asked, won or lost, and he must have felt very bad
 ekadam se mujhe lagane laga ki maine kyon haraaya
 Ammi's upbringing was like this
 vah kuch sochakar nahin sikhaa rahi thim
 But still taught that every human should think of another
 ye kaabiliyat sabamein nahin hoti
 On Salman Khan
 
 
 salmaan khan mujhe bada star he
 He simply shakes the belt-belt and the film goes on
 main chintaa main mara rahata hum ki story thik he yaa nahin, acting hui ki nahin
 
 
 So i am happy to see Salman like this
 mistar parfectionist se sawaal-jawaab'taare jameen par' kii controvarsi par kya bole aamir?jab amol gupte aae to maine kaha ki main jab produs karata hum to diarector bhi apni chwis kaa rakhata hum
 He knew this condition
 6 maheene bitaane ke baad mujhe laga ki amol ko hi karnaa hoga
 But after a week, my confidence waned
 to maine ek hafte ke baad unki script waapas kar di
 Said that whoever has spent this till date will not be considered
 magar chunki meraa bharosa hat gaya he isse, to kaam nahin kar paaungaa
 Work with him, who is very sure about it
 kanuunan script meri ho sakati thi
 But the moral right was only with Amol
 amol gupte do din baad aae or bole ki main bataur diarector hat jaataa hum
 You can continue this as an Edge Producer and Actor
 vah bole ki aap ise diarect kariye
 This is the story of stars on the ground
 aamir ko gussa kis baat par aata he
 
 
 Comes very rarely
 jab koi jhooth bole, tab shaayadapaki body bhi acting kaa kamaal hissaa hoti he
 In a trailer of Dhoom 3, you are probably seen using your ears as well, when the actor is really lost in the character, it is not just about the expression or dialogue, he is seen in everything
 kaan mere bachapan se bahut baahar nikalate hai
 He is further ejected in PK
 aamir khan airport se taxi main hotel aate hai
 So comfortable, you got into the movement while doing the film
 kya raajnneeti main aane kaa iraadaa he?nahin raajnneeti nahin karuunga
 i will do my work from the stage of cinema and communication

 Former India captain Sourav Ganguly said on Monday that he did not agree with the idea of finishing the toss in Test cricket

 These include many leaders of the ruling party and opposition, as well as many government officials
 yahaan tak ki engineyar, kaarobaari or thekedaar bhi inke husn ke jaal se nahin batch paae
 It is reported that these beauties made more than 20 leaders and officers their victims
 sunakar yakeen nahin hoga par khabar he ki in paanchon blackmailer hasinaaon ne ek do nahin balki puure 90 aise video banaae the, jinamein unke saath client kii raasalila kii tasviren kaid hai
 The special thing is that out of these 90 videos, 30 videos are only of leaders-ministers and IAS-IPS officers
 police ko aaropee mahilaon ke paas se 90 video ke saath 8 sim cards bhi mili hai
 Whose entire record is being scrutinized
 haalanki police ne inhen record main nahin liya he
 But all these evidences have been sent to the lab for forensic investigation
 jin 20 netaaon-mantriyon or afasaron ke in hasinaaon ne ashleel video banaae
 a big price was also charged in return
 abhi tak kii tahakikat se pataa chalaa he ki ye shikari hasinaayen apane shikaar se ab tak kareeb 15 karod kii rakam vasuul kar chuki thim
 These include amounts ranging from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 3 crore from different victims
 yani jiskaa jitna bada ohada or rasookh
 Such a big recovery from that
 khabar he ki in blackmailer hasinaaon kaa ye darty game kai saalon se chal rahaa tha
 In which from Bhopal to Indore
 netaa se lekar naukarshah tak
 Many influential people from business to contractor were trapped
 maamla tab khulaa jab indore nagar nigam ke ek ejeeniyar ko apane jaal main fansaane ke baad usase teen karod kii rakam maangi gai
 And the engineer lodged a complaint with the police
 uske baad police ne plan banaakar pehle us blackmailer mahila ko indore bulaayaa or phir use dabochne ke baad ek ek kar teen or aaropee mahilaon ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now the question is whether the police did not already know about this sex racket running on such a large scale
 sawaal ye bhi he ki jo mantri netaa or afasar in hasinaaon kii blakemeling kaa shikaar ho rahe the
 Why did he remain silent till now? police kii padtaal main pataa chalaa he ki club main client fansaane ke alaava ye shaatir hasinaayen apane shikaar ko saadhane ke liye hai profile partiyon main bhi aayaa jaaya karti thim
 Women caught in Honey Trap were fond of late night parties
 inke mobile phone main sharaab partiyon ke kai video mili hai
 Often on Saturday nights, they used to celebrate picnics in the name of a highway party
 aksar ye haive party bhopal-indore forlan road par hoti thim
 Apart from this such parties were kept in the resort of Sehore bypass and in big hotels or farm houses
 in partiyon main netaaon or mantriyon se lekar iees or ipies afasaron tak ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 The special thing is that out of the 20 influential people caught in the trap of these blackmailer women, seven-eight were those who were fully aware of their motive
 isaki jaankaree in mahilaon se mili mobile phone par hui baatcheet or miseje se mili he
 This is the reason why the police are considering it as organized crime in a very secretive manner and even senior officers of the police administration are not allowed to meet the accused

 Kamar Aga says that Imran has failed on every front in his country
 aarthik halaat kharaab hai, pakistan main sarkaar virdohi andolanon kii baadh ai hui he
 To divert the attention of his people from these issues, he keeps giving air to the opposition of India and keeps raising the issue of Kashmir

 The Parliament building was built, but the cause of concern at this time is the Taliban peace talks led by America
 darasal america afghanistan chhodane se pehle vahaan kii raajnneeti main taliban ko mukhyadhara main laana chahta he
 For this, the United States wants the Taliban to renounce weapons and return to the democratic process

 India has already made its stand clear in this matter

 Explain that Rajapaksa is considered pro-china

 India offered a loan of US $ 400 million to Sri Lanka for the development of infrastructure and economy during Rajapaksa's visit to Delhi
 qamar aagaa kehete hai ki maujuuda srilankai sarkaar ke chini jhukaav ke baavjood wo bharat ko nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa he
 Kamar Agha says that despite Chinese pressure, Rajapaksa will try to remain neutral and continue to seek help from both countries

 Currently, Rajapaksa has praised India after returning from a tour of India and said that they are eager to maintain warm and mutually beneficial bilateral relations with India

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar refrained from commenting on the developments in his separation from the Congress, saying it would raise suspicion that he wanted to destabilize the UPA
 tippaniyan Pawar said that the next decade will be dominated by coalition politics and there is a need to create a mindset in which political differences are not seen as personal hatred
 pavaar ne kaha ki nehru parivaar ne to congress ke itihaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai hi he, saath main kuch anya logon ne bhi swatantraaa sangram main bhoomika nibhaai he or swatantraaa kaa itihaas iskaa sakshi he

 pavaar ne kaha ki unhen chah saal ke liye congress se nikaala gaya or iske baad unhone khud alag rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Significantly, Pawar had left Congress in the year 1999 on the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin
