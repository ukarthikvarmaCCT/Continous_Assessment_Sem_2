 aalia bhatta ne abhi bolnaa siikhaa hi tha ki unhone elaan kar diya thah ‘‘main star bananaa chaahati hum!’’ un dinon ko yaad karte hue unki badi bahan 26 varshiya shaheen kahati hai, ‘‘jab us choti-si bacchee ne yah baat kahi to parivaar main kisi ko bhi uske vishwaas bhare bol par hairat nahin hui, kyonki juhu sthit unke ghar par logon ne dekha tha ki aalia kaise baat-baat main acting kiya karti thim
 "family members were not shocked even when they played Preity Zinta's childhood in Sangharsh (1999) and six-year-old Alia said," It was very easy
 ’’ pita mahesh bhatta yaad karte hai ki us film ke chaar saal ke baad philosafar you
 Yes
 krishnamurthi kii najar aalia par padi thi or unhone jht se kaha ki yah ladki ‘‘star banegi jo bade parade ko raushan karegi
 "his prediction has come true today
 21 saal kii aalia kii mutthi main hive or 2 stats kii kamyaabi he
 Audiences as well as film critics have noticed how Alia, after working in her first film Student of the Year as a heroine two years ago, managed to get a comfortable life-spanning character in these two films
 Sakuchai played the role of the girl well
 pehle weekend main 37 karod ru
 The film, which has a turnover of more than 2 states, is on the verge of becoming the biggest hit of Alia's small film journey
 mahaj box offis collection kii vajah se bollywood unhen star nahin maan rahaa
 Karan Johar in his show Kafi With Karan does not stop himself from saying that "the ability to live the character in front of the camera is not in anyone else
" ’’ vahiin 2 stats ke diarector abhishek varman kehete hai, ‘‘unhen bakhubi pataa hota he ki unhen kya chahie
 The image she created after Student of the Year, she wants to break it and is taking a challenging role to prove her versatility
 ’’apni pehali film main chote-chote kapade pahane or haath main diziner bag liye college main padhgaye vaali aakarshak ladki ke taur par aalia apni shakhsiyat jaise hi role main thim
 But Imtiaz Ali's highway has an out-of-the-box character, which Alia plays as beautifully and effortlessly as she can in the clutches of the kidnappers and the innocent Veera who is unaware of the evils of the world
 film ke ek seen main jisamen koi dialog nahin he, khilakhilaati hui aalia achaanak aansuon ke sailaab main dub jaati he
 This passionate scene is loved by both Imtiaz and Alia
 aalia kahati hai, ‘‘yah jivan badalane vaala anubhav tha
 '' Of course the film made just 28 at the box office
 11 karod ru
 Did business, but it has brought Alia to such a position that everyone's eyes are on her
 ve khud bhi maanati hai, ‘‘isane mujhe apane vyaktitv ke nae pahalu se rou-ba-rou karaayaa
 i think there was no depth in my personality
 is film se pehle kisi samasya kaa saamana karne kaa meraa koi anubhav nahin tha jisase kisi ke pradarshan ko gaharaai milti he
 Shaheen, the writer and emerging director, feels that Veera's role is one in which Alia is very comfortable
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘bina kisi suvidha vaali lokation par shoot karnaa, train main so janaa or bina garm pani ke kaam chalaanaa aise anubhav rahe jisane uski jindagi ekadam se badal di
 She realized that glamor is not the reason for her love for acting
 film main aise kai seen hai jab ve roi he
 There was no texture in them, i know my sister's tears were real
 ’’aalia kii pratibha or unki kshamtaaon ko jaanane ke liye varman ko hive dekhne kii jarurat nahin thi
 He saw Alia on the set while working as an assistant director in the film Student of the Year
 ve is baat ko lekar aashwast the ki aalia chetan bhagat ke upanyaas 2 stats da story of maai marij kii tamil nayika ananyaa ke liye ekadam sahi hai
 It is the story of an IIM graduate, grounded between modern love and family values
 varman ko jitna bharosa aalia par tha, apane role ko nibhaane main aalia usase kahin aage raheen
 Alia's confidence in Karan Johar's Dharma Productions office shows confidence
 kisi project ko chunane ke liye apni samajhadaari ke alaava ve karan ke nazariye par bharosa karti hai
 She is playing Humpty Sharma's Dulhania with the Dharma film, in which she will once again be Student of the Year with her co-star Varun Dhawan
 unki tulana akasar karina kapur khan se hoti he
 Like her, she too has studied at Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai
 unhone acting kii koi aupchaarik training nahin lee he or teen filmon ke apane safar ke baad bhi ve apni sabase kareebi pratidwandviyon 25 varshiya pariniti chopra or 26 varshiya shraddha kapur kii tulana main kahin choti hai
 Alia has proved from her performance that she is going to last long in this industry
 teen safal filmon ne unhen apane bhavishya ke bare main usee bharose ke saath baat karne kaa mauka diya he jis tarah ve bachapan main kaha karti thim
 She says, "I don't think anyone would say so impatiently but i really feel that i have come to do something special and be special
" ’’us parivaar ke ek sadsy kii jabaan se yah yah bebaak kathan he jahaan pratibha kii kami nahin he
 Alia's father, writer, director, and producer Mahesh Bhatt, is also unimpressed
 maa soni razdan bhi kalakaar hai or sauteli bahan puja bhi actor or diarector hai
 Actor Emraan Hashmi and director Mohit Suri and special Bhatt are his brothers in their relationship
 lekin filmi parivaar se hone ke baavjood, mahesh bhatta ne aalia or shaheen ko is maahaul se dur rakhaa tha
 He says, "at this time she is moving her life in the best way
" vah hamaare jivan main tohfe jaisi he
 We are surprised to see him
 vah jo kuch bhi he, apane dam par he
 "the series of compliments is from both sides
" aalia kahati hai, ‘‘mujhe apane pita par garv he
 He is an honest and fair-spoken man
 ’’ ve akasar sauteli maa kiran kii banaai biryani kaa lutf uthaane unke ghar jaati hai
 "there is a good and healthy environment in our house
 ’’aalia apane parivaar main shaheen ke sabase kareeb hai
 They are his royalty
 har saal donon landan main saath chhuttiyaan manaati hai
 Alia says, "we can't separate
" ho saktaa he ki main uske saath sari baaten saajha na karun, lekin ve mere bare main sabase zyada jaanati hai
 "shaheen's responsibility is to keep in mind that Alia's feet remain on the ground
" shaheen kahati hai, ‘‘yah industry bas cheharaa bhar he
 It is easy to turn into a different person
 main hameshaa usase kahati rahati hum ki tum jo ho, vah yaad rakhana or usase bhatakana nahin
 Alia keeps posting her selfies on Instagram to show her real glimpse in which she sometimes appears with her friends Pika and Sheeba
 kabhi-kabhi shoharat or kamyaabi kii chakachaundh baari bhi guzarati he jaisaa aalia ne coffee vid karan sho main do baar aane par anubhav kiya, jisamen karan ke general nolej ke sawaalon kaa galat jawaab dene par unki khub hansi udayi gai
 Even Karan asked his other guests to "just answer you like Alia" when he made a mistake on General Knowledge questions
 lekin ve is baat kaa katai bura nahin manaati hai or apane pasandida tivi sho frends kii ek line kaa hawala dekar kahati hai, ‘‘maine ek nai tarah kii shuruyaat kii
 "all this goes on in public life
 lekin jab tak ve parade par apni adaakaari se darshakon kaa dil jitati rahengi or unka manoranjan karti rahengi, unhen chintaa karne kii zyada jarurat nahin hai

 Experts from Cyber security have revealed that some ethical hackers have started taking action against objectionable pages running on social media in India
 unhone kuch aise fasebuk profile or pej ko band kiya he, jo ladakiyon kii fasebuk elbum se unki tasviren nikaalkar unke saath chhedchhad karne main lipt the

 The Prime Minister's home state Gujarat is very important for the BJP in trying to maintain its hold in the west of the country in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as it is considered the safest electoral constituency of the party
 haalanki, logon main is baat ko lekar andeh he ki party 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main 26-0 se jeet hasil karne kaa apana pradarshan doharaa paaegi
 But the party is fully confident about this
 party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh or gujarat main chunaav prabharee omprakash maathur kaa kahana he, ''26 siton main se 22 pehle se hi surakshit hai
 We are fully confident of our performance in the remaining four seats as well
 '' is aatmavishvaas kaa ek kaaran yah he ki pakistan ke balakot main bhartiya vayusena ke hawaii hamale ke baad party ko apane chunaav prachaar main rashtrawaad kaa mudda pramukhataa se uthaane se puraa phayda milane kii ummid he
 This is a discussion that even the Congress is unable to ignore
 12 march ko ahmedabad main congress kaarysmiti kii baithak jisamen sonia gandhi or priyanka gandhi bhi upasthit thim, main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne party ke kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki ve bhaajapa ke rashtravaadi vimarsh se ghabaraaen nahin or narendra modi sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko janata ke saamne ujagar karne kaa kaam karte rahen
 The party also welcomed the involvement of Patidar leader Hardik Patel
 us din gandhinagar main rahul or priyanka kii raily main baari bheed juty thi
 This enthusiasm of the public is seen as a positive sign in the Congress
 party ke netaaon ko ummid he ki graminon ke sankat jaise vaastavik or jamini mudde antatru rashtravaadi vimarsh ko gaun bana denge or party ko gujarat main 8-12 siten mil sakati hai
 However, some analysts believe that the Congress's assessment may prove to be wrong for several reasons
 pehali to yahi ki balakot par hamale ke baad gujarat main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata bahut bad gai he
 Apart from this, the way the Congress got the support of Hardik Patel in the 2017 assembly elections and won 80 seats out of 182 seats, there is also no hope of it because Hardik himself has remained entangled with the decision of Gujarat High Court
 
 2015 main patel aarakshan ke andolan ke dauraan danga bhadakaane ke maamle main hycourt ne hardik patel ko doshi tehraane ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 This has thwarted Congress's plan to field Hardik from Jamnagar, though he is free to campaign
 rahul gandhi kii ore se niyukt rajya ke nae netritv ko abhi apane pair jamaane hai
 The state's new Congress president Amit Chavda, who is an OBC Kshatriya leader, is not yet vocal
 jabaki vipaksh ke netaa paresh dhanani kahin zyada sakriy hai
 In Gujarat, party spokesperson Manish Doshi is quite optimistic: "local issues such as rural problems and unemployment will dominate the elections
" congress ko yahaan kareeb 14 siton par jeet mil sakati he
 We are winning Jamnagar, Surendranagar, Junagadh, Amreli, Anand, Patan and Banaskantha easily
 ''lekin chunaav ke maukey par congress ke kuch asardaar obisi or patel netaaon ke paala badalane se bhaajapa ko phayda mil saktaa he
 Congress MLA from Manavadar and influential Ahir leader Jawahar Chavda joined BJP last month
 mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne unhen turant cabinet main shaamil kar liya
 The BJP had been trying to pull Chavda towards itself since 2007
 unke baad do anya netaa bhi bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye—patel bahul oonja se purv vidhayak aashaa patel or jamnagar gramin se vidhayak vallabh dharavia
 Last year, the BJP managed to pull Kunwarji Bavaliya, the influential Congress leader of the Koli fraternity, and was made a minister
 in sab jhatkon ke baavjood congress ko ummid he ki patel samudaay kii naaraazgi or rajya tathaa centre main bhaajapa ke bade-bade khokhale daavon ke kaaran matadaata uske paksh main vot kar sakate hai
 "A large section of Patels in rural areas are angry with the BJP," says Dhanani
 ''baharhaal, gujarat bhaajapa ke pravaktaa bharat pandya kehete hai ki rajya main centre kii kalyankari yojanaon ko lagu karne se party 'ajey sthiti' main pahunch gai he
 They refer for example to the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana under which poor farmers get Rs 6,000 a year
 die jate hai
 As many as 30,000 farmers of the state have been benefited under the scheme and a target of benefiting 17,000 other farmers by election day
 bhaajapa ke chunaav prachaar main party ke chaar mukhya chehre hai—saaf chhavi vaale roopaani, kendriya krishi rajyamantri purushottam roopala jo rajya main party ke star vaktaa hai, up-mukhyamantri nitin patel or pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh jitu waghani
 On the other hand, the Congress camp is relying on Amit Chavda and Dhanani, besides former state president Bharat Solanki and OBC Kshatriya leader and Congress MLA Alpesh Thakur from Radhanpur
 thakur kaa prabhaav uttar gujarat ke obisi kshatriya bahul ilaakon main myne rakhata he, khaskar banaaskantha main jahaan bhaajapa ke paas is jati kaa koi bada netaa nahin he
 Although the election campaign of the party has been boosted by the candidature of BJP President Amit Shah from Gandhinagar, but the political know-how of Ahmedabad from Japan
 pathak kehete hai ki bhaajapa booth str ke network ke maamle main congress se kahin aage he or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii jeet ke peeche yah bhi ek bada kaaran tha
 Already, 50,000 Vistaraks — BJP workers who convey the party's message directly to voters — are contacting voters at 50,000 booths and telling people about the achievements of the BJP government
 bhaajapa apane 9,500 shakti kendron ko bhi sakriy kar chuki he
 Says Pathak, "the BJP is confident with the conditions being favorable and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh fully active
 '' lekin ve chetavanee bhi dete hai ki apni uplabdhiyon ke bare main bahut zyada chaati thonkane se party ko ahamkaari bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 He says, "the ruling party going to ask for a mandate again needs to show humility
" 2014 main bhaajapa vipaksh kii party thi isliye yah chal gaya
 But it is not necessary that this time it will work
 ''siyaasi surmavijay roopaani gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii svachh chhavi he
 However, questions have been raised about his hold on the government
 unhen samajhadaar prashaasak mana jaataa he

 The chit fund scandal of West Bengal has exposed another evil face of politics
 chitfund company ke emdi kii chitthee saamne aane ke baad trinmul ke daaman par bhi chhinte pade hai or congress ke kuch netaa bhi shaq ke ghere main aa gaye hai
 The letter by Sudipto Sen, accused of robbing people of their hard-earned money in West Bengal, has created panic in the politics
 sudipton ke khat main trinmul saansad kunal ghosh kaa sidhe-sidhe naam liya gaya he
 According to sources, Sudipto has said in his letter that he had to pay big money regularly to many politicians
 unheen main se ek hai trinmul ke rajyasabha saansad kunal ghosh, jinhen har maheene 16 lakh rupye pagaar kii tarah dene padate the
 The lawyer wife of a Congress minister in the central government and a powerful Congress MP from North East also had to pay
 kaha jaataa he ki 9 april ko sudipto ne man hi man khudakushi kii taiyaari kar lee thi
 At the same time Sudipto must have written this letter with the intention of opening the whole raw paper
 sudipto kii 18 pej kii chitthee ke saath ek list he jisamen 22 logon ke naam hai
 It has been alleged that these people used Sudipto Sen to make money
 inamen se 5 naam diggaj siyaasi netaaon ke hai
 These include 2 Rajya Sabha mps of Trinamool Congress and a minister of Assam Government
 chitthee ke masaude par yakeen karen to sharada realty ke farzivaade main siyaasi saath-ganth kaa pataa chalata he
 However, both TMC and Congress are rejecting these allegations

 The matter is being tried to discredit the judiciary
 is faisle par varisht samaajawaadee netaa sharad yadav ne kaha he ki, is maamle main jaanch honi chahie thi
 It is wrong to dismiss the petition
 koi bhi nyaayatantr ko nuksaan pahunchaana nahin chahta: sharad yadavasharad yadavane kaha, 'jaanch honi chahie thi
 Nobody wants to harm the judiciary
 puraa vipaksh is maamle main jaanch kii maang kar rahaa he or aaj court main kya hua
 i think the way the petition was dismissed and it was said that an attempt was being made to discredit the judiciary is wrong
 ye upyukt tippanee nahin he
 'judge Loya's death is a serious matter: Sharad Yadavshrad Yadav further said,' Judge Loya's death is a serious matter, but the way the case was dismissed is not correct
 is maamle se jude kai mudde hai
 Had there been an inquiry, people would have had faith in justice

 The judge was hearing the case earlier, but expressed displeasure at BJP president Amit Shah not appearing in the case
 jiske baad unka tabadalaa ho gaya tha
 After this, Justice Loya had heard the case
 disambar 2014 main hui thi mautasambar, 2014 main justise loya kii nagpur main maut ho gai thi
 Which was considered suspicious
 justise loya kii maut ke baad jin jaj ne is maamle kii sunwaayee kii, unhone amit shah ko maamle main bari kar diya tha

 Samajwadi Party (SP) national vice-president Kiranmay Nanda said on Sunday that his party, along with the BSP in Uttar Pradesh, is capable of defeating the BJP in the upcoming general election and does not require a non-essential force like the Congress
 haalanki unhone yah sanket diya ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan raibareli evam amethi nirvachan kshetra ko chhod saktaa he jinka loksabhaa main pratinidhitiv kramash: samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi karte hai
 Nanda said, 'congress is an unnecessary force in Uttar Pradesh, so we are not thinking of including or keeping it out
 rajya main sapa-basapa gathbandhan mukhya takat he to bhaajapa kaa saamana karenge
 The Congress may hold one or two seats
 yah faisla lenaa congress par he ki vah apane aap ko kahaan dekhnaa chaahati he
 Nanda's remarks came after reports of talks intensifying between Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav to take a final decision on seat sharing before Lok Sabha elections
 donon netaaon ne shuukravaar ko nayi dilli main mulaakaat kii thi
 According to Nanda, the Congress is still not able to adapt to the mantra of 'coalition politics' as it is not ready for its allies to leave even an inch in states where it is strong but where it is weak for others

 prem nagari paris in dinon duusari vajahon se charchaa ke centre main aa gai he
 Paris has taken a strange initiative to control pollution
 paris main sabhi public transport ko free kar diya gaya he
 That is, here you can travel in bus, train, metro etc
 without taking a ticket
 darasal, pichley das saal ke dauraan paris main pradooshan kaa str kai guna bad gaya he
 This time the level of Parisian pollution has been found to be very high in winter

 Explain that the main causes of pollution in Paris are car smoke and wood fire in homes
 darasal, paris main sardiyon ke dauraan log ghar ko garm rakhane ke liye lakdiyaan jalaate hai
 The Delhi High Court expressed surprise at the marathon in the midst of heavy pollution, though the administration found that most people have started using public transport to avoid trouble during the odd-even rule in Paris
 aise main paris prashasan dwaara free public transport policy laane ke baad yah ummid kii ja rahi he ki log zyada se zyada public transport lene ke liye prerit honge
 Pollution is like a massacre, it needs to be stopped: Delhi High Court should also take a lesson, however the level of pollution in Paris is much lower than Delhi
 phir bhi paris ne sartakta dikhaate hue sthiti ko or gambhir mode par jane se pehle hi sanbhaalane ke liye jaruri kadam uthaa liye hai
 Delhi should also learn a lesson from this
 dilli sarkaar ne bhi dilli main od-ivan policy laakar polution ko niyantrit karne kaa prayaas kiya, par uske baad sari sartakta or koshishen thandhe baste main chali gai
 Chemical pneumonia is spreading in Delhi, there is no risk of pollution Kamdilli will have to take big steps to control pollution like Paris

 Tejashwi Yadav has attacked the government for shelving the old demand of special state status to Bihar by the Nitish Kumar government
 tejasvi yadav ne sawaal poocha he ki jab dilli or bihar main ek hi sarkaar he to bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja kyon nahin mil rahaa he?darasal, kuch vakt pehle andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin die jane ke virodh main telegu desham party (tidipi) ne centre sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 Since then, the RJD has started pressuring the Nitish government
 argedy kaa kahana he ki jab tidipi andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin milane par narendra modi sarkaar kaa saath chhod sakati he to phir nitish kumaar aisa kyon nahin kar sakate?tejasvi kaa kahana he ki jab dilli aurabiharmen ek hi sarkaar he to nitish kumaar kis se vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kar rahe hai
 From RJD or Public? On Wednesday, while tweeting on the issue, Tejashwi Yadav said, "when Mian, Biwi and Kazi Raji again why is this Noora Tirandaji"
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar, upmukhyamantrisushil kumaar modior kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko is mudde par janata ko jawaab dena hi padegaa

 bharat banaam australia
 
 
 Sharjah 
 
 coca-cola cap
 Match number 6
 australia ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 284 ranon kaa pahaad-sa score banaaya
 India needed to go to the finals, win
 lekin tabhi sharajah main retila tufaan aa gaya or score ko chota kar diya gaya
 But when the storm came to a halt, there was a storm inside the ground, which blew the entire Australia team and got its name recorded in history
 is tufaan kaa naam tha sachin ramesh tendulkar
 Sachin, as he landed at the opening with Sourav Ganguly, seemed as if he had some determination in mind
 unhone australian gendbaajon ko jis tarah khelnaa shuru kiya wo gussa ballebaaji main dikh rahaa tha
 Sachin constantly spared Shane Warne, Kasprowicz, Steve Waugh, Tom Moody
 or aage bad-bad kar chakke jade
 India lost the match, but made it to the finals on the basis of net run rate
 do din baad jab final hua to phir aisa hi nazaaraa tha
 In the final too, Sachin smashed an innings of 134 runs and similarly blasted the Australian bowlers
 sachin ke chakke, tony greg kii awaz or sharajah
 These two innings of Sachin were named as Sharjah Storm, that is, the storm of Sachin in Sharjah
 sachin tendulkar ke lagbhag 25 saal ke kariyar main naa-jane kitne aise pal yaa paariyaan ain jo unhen duusare khilaadiyon se alag kar detii ye do paariyaan bhi unheen main se ek rahi
 On November 15, 1989, when a 16-year-old boy landed in Karachi to bat in front of the dreaded Pakistan bowlers
 to kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ye hi baccha 'cricket kaa bhagwaan' kehalaayegaa
 Master blaster, God of cricket, Tendalya dont know how many names are there for Sachin
 ye sachin hi jisane lagbhag 25 saal tak bhartiya phens kii ummiido ko apane kandhe par jiya or lagbhag har baar un ummiido par khara bhi utre
 Sachin changed the way / attitude of watching cricket in this country
 kyonki 90 ke dashak main jab sachin apane charam par the, hindustan main tivi sachin kii ballebaaji ke saath khulte the or unke out hone ke baad band ho jate the
 Millions of people fasted for Sachin, former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has also said that he used to say that when Sachin came to bat, then pick me up
 ye sachin hi the, jinaki vajah naa jane kitne bacchon kaa naam hi desh main sachin ho gaya kyonki unke mata-pita ko sachin pasand he
 Sachin wanted to become a fast bowler, but luck made him a batsman
 or ballebaaj bhi aise ki cricket jagat ke saare record apane naam kar die
 Sachin used to come down to bat early in his career, but a decision by then captain Mohammad Azharuddin in 1994 completely changed Sachin's batting and perhaps even Indian ODI cricket
 27 march 1994 kaa din cricket ke liye aitihaasik din sabit hua
 In the 70th ODI career, Sachin got the opening opportunity, which he took full advantage and went on to record one after the other
 1994 ke newjiland daure main team india ke niyamit openar navjot singh siddhu kii gardan main pareshaani kii vajah se sachin se pari kaa aagaaj karaayaa gaya
 Sachin also wanted the same, for this he had appealed to captain Azharuddin and manager Ajit Wadekar
 is match main sachin ne 49 gendon main 82 ran thok die
 As an opener, Sachin set many records
 
 
 # openar ke rup main sachin ne 344 maichon main 48
 He scored 15310 runs at an average of 29
 # nichle kram par unhone 119 maichon main 33 kii ausat se 3116 ran banaae
 # Out of 49 total of Sachin's ODI career, 45 came in opening centuries
 # vanade kaa unka pehla shatak 79wein match main aayaa, vah bhi opening karte hue
 There are so many records of Sachin's name
 vanade, test cricket samet antarrashtriya cricket main sabase zyada ran, shatak kaa kirtiman unke naam hi he
 Which probably seems unbreakable
 sachin kaa kariyar or kuch record par nazar
 
 
 # 200 Test match, 15921 runs
 51 shatak, 68 ardhashatak
 Average 53
 78 # chauthe number par ballebaaji karte hue kareeb 13,492 ran
 Average 44
 83 # 463 vanade match, 18426 ran
 49 centuries, 96 fifties
 # 2278 ran, sirf world cap main
 Highest 673 runs in 2003 World Cup
 # vanade main australia ke khilaaf sabase zyada 3077 ran, uske baad srilanka 3133 ran
 # First batsman to score 200 runs in odis
 # 62 baar main of da match kaa aword
 # 15 Man of the Series Award
 # australia ke khilaaf sabase zyada 9 shatak
 # 7 times over 1000 runs in a single year
 sachin tendulkar ko cricket se alavida kahe hue lagbhag 5 saal ho gaye hai
 But in these five years neither cricket nor Sachin got away from Sachin
 aaj bhi agar sachin kahin khadey ho jaae yaa unki jhalak dikh jaae to sachin-sachin kii awaz gunj uthati he
 Sachin is still associated with Mumbai Indians in the IPL as a mentor
 aaj ke samay main ek charchaa hameshaa bani rahati he kya koi sachin ke record ko tod paaegaa
 Indian captain Virat Kohli is the most named in this episode
 viraat kaa kariyar abhi tak jis tarah se rahaa he or vah jitne ran or shatak bana chuke hai, ho saktaa he viraat sachin kaa record tod bhi den
 If this happens then it will not be surprising, once Sachin himself said that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are batsmen who can break their records
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki koi bhi ballebaaj sirf aankadon main hi sachin ke record ko tod saktaa he
 The way Sachin lived his career from 1989 to 2013 and the way he always remained a ray of hope in the heart of every Indian cricket fan during these years
 shaayad wo chiz kabhi koi doosraa cricketer nahin kar paaegaa
 The career as long as Sachin Tendulkar is not possible in today's time and neither does the spirit like Sachin appear in anyone
 sachin ne apane kariyar ke kai saal chot main guzaar die lekin khilne kii jid aisi rahi ki phir lade or phir waapas aae
 Batsmen will come, go, record will be broken
 lekin sachin ramesh tendulkar ek hi rahegaa
 Hence Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, neither ghost nor future
 happy berthde sachin tendulkar

 (you can also feel this noise) karnataka main sarkaar gathan kii disha main buudhvaar ko koi pahal nahin kii gai, kyonki pradesh bhaajapa ko rajya main vaikalpik sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ke liye kendriya netritv kii hari jhandi kaa intjaar he
 There is a need for an alternative government in Karnataka because the congress-jd (S) coalition government (karnataka Government) could not get the confidence vote in the Assembly
 do din guzar jane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ne abhi sarkaar banane ke liye koi daawa pesh nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, the question arises that why the BJP, which is hurrying to vote on the vote of confidence, has not yet made a claim to form the government? Yeddyurappa was once the biggest BJP leader and thrice Chief Minister in the state after the Kumaraswamy government fell
 Then there was the possibility of getting the responsibility of the post of CM
 lekin sawaal yahaan par yah he ki yediurppa kii umr 75 saal paar ho chuki he, aise main kya bhaajapa abhi bhi unhen siem kii jimmedaari degi?kyonki bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki vah 75 saal se zyada umr ke netaa ko koi jimmedaari nahin detii
 So is Yeddyurappa's age not a hindrance in forming a BJP government? On Thursday, Karnataka BJP leaders Jagdish Shettiger, Basavaraj Bommai and Arvind Limbawali reached his home to meet BJP National Party President Amit Shah
 iske baad karnataka bhaajapa netaa jiem parameshwar ne kaha ki We currently have 105 mlas
 maamla court main bhi he,spikar ne bhi faisla nahin kiya he
 We will make 100 percent government forever
 bhaajapa netaa bies yediurppa ne vishwaas mat main congress-jedies sarkaar girane ke baad kaha tha ki vah party netritv se milenge, uske baad rajyapal se mulaakaat karne jaaenge
 During the trust vote, 105 votes were cast in favor of BJP and 99 in favor of Kumaraswamy's government
 iske baad kumaraswami ne mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya tha
 The 14-month-old congress-jd (S) government fell on Tuesday after losing the confidence vote in the assembly
 iske baad mukhyamantri ech di kumaraswami ne istipha de diya
 Kumaraswamy got only 99 votes against the bjp's 105 votes in the strength test in the assembly
 karnataka bhaajapa adhyaksh bi es yediurppa ne kaha ki vah rajya main vaikalpik sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ke liye party ke kendriya netritv ke nirdeshon kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Yeddyurappa told reporters after meeting RSS leaders at his state headquarters' Keshav Kripa ',' i am waiting for instructions from Delhi
 main kisi bhi vakt vidhayak dal kii baithak bula saktaa hum or (daawa pesh karne ke liye) rajbhavan ja saktaa hum
 i am waiting for this ' China saw a decrease in the number of Internet cafes for the first time in 8 years

 The Supreme Court said that it will hear after 6 weeks after the report of this committee
 tippaniyan The petition said that such Santa Banta jokes hurt the sentiments of the community and also tarnish the image internationally

 sahitya ajtak ke duusare din kii shuruyaat chhath geet se huibijepi netaa manoj tiwari ne manch se gaae kai bhojpuri gitsahitya kaa sabase bada mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak 2019' shuukravaar (1 november) se shuru ho gaya he
 Today is the second day of the program
 duusare din 'sahitya ajtak' ke 'hallaa bol' manch par 'vichaardhaara kaa sahitya' seshan main sudhish pachori (lekhak), sachchidanand joshi (sadsy sachiv, indira gandhi rashtriya kala centre) or anant vijay (lekhak, aalochak) ne apni raay rakhi
 The session was conducted by Aaj Tak's Executive Editor Rohit Sardana
 is charchaa ke dauraan teenon atithiyon ne apni baaten bebaaki se rakhin
 Starting the discussion, Rohit said that ideology makes literature or literature creates ideology
 donon ek-duusare ko majboot karte hai yaa kamjor karte hai, donon main se kis par kiski chaaya rahati he or donon main se koun kisko aage badhaata he yaa peeche khinchataa he, in saare sawaalon par baat karenge
 During the discussion, writer and critic Anant Vijay said that the peg is a very small word, in fact, the pillar of Marxism is buried
 us khambhe ko aise logon ne pakad rakhaa he jinako lagata he ki khambhe se dur jate hi sab khatm ho jayega
 People of Marxism are those who have something else in their creations, they say something else and do something else
 ye prati tark diya ja saktaa he ki vyakti kisi vichaardhaara ko ho saktaa he usase uski rachana kaa kya, jaise vah charitraheen ho saktaa he lekin apni rachanaaon main bahut hi uttam charitra vaale nayak kaa chithran karata he
 But when you say such things, you do not get recognition in the society
 jo jhuthe bhram failaakar aap manyata lete bhi ho wo bahut der tak tikta nahin he
 Actually, the problem of ideology happened, when we talk about ideology in Indian context, i speak a little openly, so i also face a lot of attacks, Marxists have ruined literature in this country
 naa sirf sahitya balki saamaajik, aarthik main jo moulik lekhan hota tha usko band kar diya
 The books of Pragati Prakashan started selling here
 itani bikne lageen ki bhartiya vaichariki ko baadhit kar diya unhone
 This was followed by a joint effort of the Government of India and the Government of Russia
 iske to ab pramaan bhi milane lage hai
 If you see all the documents, there is many evidence that they made a very concerted effort to spread Marxism here and take Marxism down to the bottom
 us prayaas kaa pratifal yah tha ki bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main khaas kar hindi vibhaag main jo litarechar se jude hai unamem aap jaakar dekh lijie unamem bas logon ne vampanth kaa billaa nahin lagaaya hua he

 marxvaadi aajkal bal swayamsevak hone kii jugat main lage hanek kissa bataate hue unhone aage kaha pachori ji ne narendra kohli ji ko janavaadee lekhak sangh kaa sadsy bana diya or kahin kaa sanyojak niyukt kar diya
 Now where did Kohli ji and democracy, but when he asked Kohli, he argued that tell who was a more democratic person than Ram, let him live in the forest for 14 years
 adivaasiyon ke bich rahe
 After that, he was pressurized by all his friends to pressure Kohli to remove him
 ant kya hua ki kohli ji jaise lekhak ko pachori ji ko janavaadee lekhak sangh se baahar karnaa padaa
 The situation is that a writer was fired because he talks of Rama instead of Marx, he chants the garland of Indianness, he does not look towards Russia
 apni rachanaaon main yatharth kii mitti utani nahin todta
 The Marxists, who spread the feeling of untouchability, did a lot of damage to Indian literature
 khaskar hindi main agar dekhen to wo vichaardhaara ko lekar jabatak chalate the tabatak thik tha lekin main ye baat baar-baar kahata hum ki vichaardhaara ko dhara bananaa or dhara main baaki saare lekhakon ko chalane ke liye duraagrah karnaa yah marxvaadiyon kii sabase badi bhul thi or aaj halaat yah he ki tamaam marxvaadi aajkal bal swayamsevak hone kii jugat main lage hai
 Like Gopal Kanda, all Marxist writers are engaged in becoming child volunteers and child volunteers
 ye vichaardhaara kaa vichlan he
 From this you can understand that this ideology is based on selfishness and it has nothing to do with ideas
 marxvaadiyon ne kiye saahitiyik bhrashtachanant vijay ne kaha ki marxvaadiyon ne anya lekhakon ko chhapane se to roka hi iske saath-saath unhone sirf vaicharik aatankwaad hi nahin failaayaa balki tamaam saahitiyik bhrashtachar bhi kiye
 The progressive word, scam is there
 bina puunji ke aap marxvaadi lekhak nahin ho sakate
 The addition of Daru and Murga makes a Marxist writer
 paramparawaadi matlab dakiyanoosee ho gaya he
 Those who are traditionalists are actually progressive, while those who call themselves progressive are traditionalists, they do not want to change, they do not want to be separated from the pegs
 wo log tamatum ke ghode kii tarah sidhe hi dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Ideology is not bad
 vichaardhaara vaale log bhrasht hote hai

 donon ne ek saath milakar 'ek tha tiger' or 'bajrangi bhaijan' jaisi superhit filmein di hai or ab donon 'tubalite' main bhi saath kaam kar rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, there is a rift between the two
 salamanis film ke ko-produsar bhi hai
 It is being said that there are creative differences between the two and the talk between the two has increased so much that both have decided not to work together in future
 'tubalite' kii shooting ke liye manali pahunche salmaan khanakbirto shaayad sab kuch bhul kar aage kaam karne kaa faisla le bhi len lekin salmaan agar gusse main aa gayen to wo nishchay hi kabir ke saath kaam nahin karenge
 When Kabir was asked about this, he said, this news is wrong
 donon ke kaaman doston kaa bhi kuch yahi maananaa he
 He says there were differences between the two even at the time of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' but the film earned Rs 300 crore and both are now also working in 'tubelight'
 ham bhi yahi chaahate hai ki donon ke bich sab thik ho kyonki bhavishya main ham donon kii jodi ko phir se saath dekhnaa chaahate hai

 unhone poocha ki mujffarpur balika grih yon shoshan maamle ke mukhya aaropee brajesh thakur ko police ne remand par lene kii koshish ab tak kyon nahin kii, jabaki kaha ja rahaa he ki vah police jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 Tejashwi said that one-year phone call details of Thakur should be made public, so that the white-collar can also be exposed
 unhone yah bhi poocha ki maheenon se maasoom bacchiyon se dushkarm ho rahaa tha, aise main samaaj kalyaan or police vibhaag kya kar rahi thi? netaa pratipaksh ne kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch ucch nyaayalay kii nigaraanee main sibiai se honi chahie

 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya ab vakt aa gaya he ki balaatkaar ke liye faansee kii sajaa honi chahie? Many women's organizations fear that the provision of capital punishment for rape will increase the risk to the victim's life, as the accused will try to kill the victim to erase evidence

 However, the chairperson of the Women's Commission Mamta Sharma says that the rapists should be given life imprisonment, so that they realize death every day
 tippaniyan On October 13, 2012, the Supreme Court had said on rape, that the trial and the High Court should not take this cowardly crime lightly and punish the harshest possible accused who had also killed the victim
 saath hi, sabooton ko aankane main zyada saavdhaanee barti jaae or aaropee ko kamjor tathyon par aaazaad na kiya jaae
 On molestation, the Supreme Court said on November 30, 2012, that molestation cases could be stopped with little effort and if it was not stopped, the consequences would be terrible
 vaise isi satr main sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ek bill pesh kar rakhaa he, jisamen yon hamalon ke liye kadi sajaaon kii baat he
 This is the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 2012, which if passed, will carry a minimum sentence of seven years for sexual assaults
 agar iske liye koi police yaa sarkari afasar yaa apni haisiyat kaa istemaal kar rahaa koi manager yaa adhikari jimmedaar paaya jaataa he, to use kam se kam 10 saal kii bamashkkat kaid se lekar umrakaid tak ho sakati he
 The purpose of this bill is to amend the IPC, CRPC, 1973 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
 dilli main gangrape ke maamle ne puure desh main logon ko acroshit kar diya he
 Questions are arising everywhere that if the law is more stringent to punish these poor, there is no need to strictly follow it
 The maximum punishment for gang rape under the law is life imprisonment, but despite this there is no fear of punishment
 desh main har 22wein minute main or dilli main har 18wein minute main kisi ladki yaa mahila ke saath balaatkaar hota he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the time has come that there should be a death sentence for rape? kai mahila sanghathanon ko ashanka he ki rape ke liye faansee kii sajaa ke praavdhaan se peedit kii jaan par khatra bad jayega, kyonki mulgim saboot mitaane ke liye peedit kii hatya kii koshish karegaa
 In the country only one-fourth of the rape cases are punishable and the conviction rate is 26 percent

 There is a need to speed up the execution of the sentence

 Also, more care should be taken in assessing the evidence and the accused should not be freed on weak facts

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has now started expanding its scope rapidly
 vajah haih narendra modi ke netritv main centre kii satta main pehali baar bijepi kaa purna bahumat ke saath aana
 Taking lessons from the differences that emerged between the ruling NDA-1 in power and this mother organization, both organizations have done their homework
 samanvay ke tahat hi sangh parade ke peeche se nitigat maamalon main sarkaar ko salaah de rahaa he to khud ke vistaar kii dirghakaalik yojana par usne amal karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, especially the new young voters voted for the BJP for change, but the Sangh has taken a step in the direction of carrying out the task of how to connect those youth with ideology
 bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke chah maheene ke bheetar pehle uttar pradesh ke agra main sangh ke braj praant kii ore se yuva sankalp shivi kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 The second event was recently held at Patanjali Yogpeeth of Swami Ramdev in Haridwar, Uttarakhand
 pratibha palaayan rokane kii kavayadasangh kii yah kavayad vaise kareeb dashak bhar se chali aa rahi he
 But encouraged by the formation of a government of its ideology at the Center, the Sangh is adding new dimensions to it
 sangh ke sutron ke mutabik, modi ke mek in india naare se sidhe yuvaaon ko jodgaye kii disha main sangh kii koshish pratibha palaayan ko rokna he
 Hence 30,000 students from colleges in 12 cities were approached in the camp held from 1 to 3 November in Agra
 phir kuch samooh banaakar charchaa karai gai or 5,060 chaatro ko iske liye chunaa gaya
 In this also, the Sangh took care that the students of the faculty of Graduate, Post Graduate, Technical Education, Commerce and some professors should also join it
 isi tarah 28 se 30 november ko uttarakhand ke haridwar main yojit is shivi ko navasrujan shivi naam diya gaya
 In this unique camp organized by the Sangh, 7,000 young degree holder students participated
 isamen se 5,276 chaatr shivi main hissaa lene ke liye khud ke kharide ganavesh ke saath pahunche the
 In these two camps, Anand Kumar, the founder of Super-30, who runs the institute for the IIT entrance examination in Patna, was called to give special consideration
 unhone chaatro ko bharat ke gauravshaalee ateet kii yaad dilaate hue kaha ki ek samay tha jab duniya se log nalanda or takshashila aate the
 a senior Sangh leader says that such camps will be organized by the Sangh in all its provinces located across the country
 sutron kaa daawa he ki darasal sarkaar banane ke baad sangh parivaar or bijepi samanvay ke saath sadhi hui ranneeti par kaam kar rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi's dialogue directly with school children on September 5 on the occasion of Teacher's Day is only part of the Sangh's long-term strategy
 sangh-bijepi ab peedhishon kii aisi parat taiyaar karnaa chaahate hai jo kam-se-kam 50 saal tak desh main raaj karne kii kshamta rakh sake
 "the Sangh wants to create a new leadership in the entire country," says an RSS official involved in the camp
 isliye khaas taur se 18 se 25 saal ke yuvaaon ko in shiviron ke liye chunaa ja rahaa he or unhen bataaya ja rahaa ki rashtrawaad or hindutv kya he
 Political implications of the Sangh's Navsarjan Camp are also being extracted at the Sangh and Swami's Jugalbandi Patanjali Yogpeeth (a group of youths from various colleges participating in the Sangh's Navsarjan Camp)
 swami ramdev pehle se modi ke kattar samarthak rahe hai
 She herself is a supporter of Swadeshi and Yogpeeth herself works in this direction
 duusari taraf bhaag-daud kii jindagi main yoga kii ore yuvaaon kaa rujhaan bhi teji se bad rahaa he
 Recently, the central government has changed the security of Swami Ramdev to z plus outside Uttarakhand

 afghanistan ke punanirmaan main bharat kii bhoomika kii prashansa karte hue hillari in ‘shankaaon’ ko bhi kam karne kaa prayaas karti dikhin ki america bharat ko hameshaa afghanistan or pakistan ke ‘sandarbh’ main hi dekhtaa he
 Hillary said, "in our talks, we will talk about local issues, the most important of which is the future of Afghanistan
" bharat or america samet duniya ke vibhinn deshon kii afghanistan main bhagidaari he or afghanistan ke bhavishya nirmaan main bharat kaa yogadan sakaaratmak or ahm he
 'hillary said' India is an emerging global force and the local power of Asia
 isliye afghanistan samet puure pados kii chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye bharat ke saath kareebi sahyog se kaam karne kii jarurat he
 The US Secretary of State said, "both India and the United States must play a leading role in deciding the fate of the 21st century
" ’ krishna ne is baat par jor diya ki donon deshon ke bich sambandh gahare or vyapak ho rahe hai or ranneetik vaarta usee kaa parinaam he
 Krishna said, "both of us are interested in building stable international borders and bringing peace and stability to the whole world including Asia and now we have the best opportunity to work together to achieve this objective
 ’hillari ne kaha ki bharat main kuch logon ko shankaa he ki america nayi dilli kii ore puraa dhyaan nahin de rahaa or kai baar america main aisi shankaaen paidaa hoti hai ki bharat apane nae rup ko angikaar nahin kar rahaa
 Hillary said that through this strategic dialogue both countries will face these issues directly and openly
 ’apane saamaanya se lambey sambodhan main hillari ne bahut se muddon kii charchaa kii, jisamen aatankwaad nirodh se lekar jalwaayu parivartan, harith takanic, khaadya suraksha, antarrashtriya suraksha, shiksha kshetra main dwipaksheeya sahyog or asainya parmaanu samjhauta bhi shaamil hai
 Hillary also praised India's role in Afghanistan in an address that lasted more than 13 minutes
 hillari ne bhartiya shishtmandal ko aashwaasan diya ki america dakshin asia main bharat kii chintaaon se avgat he, khaas taur par afghanistan sambandhi chintaaon ke bare main
 He said that America will work with New Delhi to deal with these concerns
 unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki bharat or america ‘aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ke shikaar hai’ or donon deshon ke liye suraksha sheershasth praathamikta he
 Hillary said that both countries should increase cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism in the form of better intelligence participation, so that 'our countries can become safe
 ’ america videsh mantri ne kaha ki america bhartiya sena ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye patibaddh he or is baat ko kam hi log jaanate hai ki america ke bharat ke saath sarvaadhik sainya abhyaas hote hai
 Hillary emphasized that the level of relations between the people of the two countries has not yet reached that level
 unhone kaha he ki ab samay aa gaya he ki ‘washington or nayi dilli’ ko usee tarah mil janaa chahie, jis tarah ‘neuyark or mumbai’ mili hue hai
 Krishna said that given the global stand taken by the security challenges today, especially in view of transnational terrorism, it is necessary that the two countries work more closely together than ever before
 krishna ne kaha ‘haalanki aatankwaad kaa centre bharat ke pados main he, lekin yah ab dur-daraaj tak or duniya ke har kone main pahunch gaya he, jaisaa hamane haal hi main times squaire ke maamle main dekha
 Krishna said that in view of this, organizations that encourage ideology of hatred and violence are increasingly carrying out their actions by colluding with each other and sharing their resources
 , It is necessary for all of us to focus our efforts against every such organization and individual
 ’ unhone kaha ki inamen se kisi ek samooh ko nishaanaa bananaa keval kam samay kaa jhootha aaraam degaa or isse lambey samay main sthirataa nahin aegi
 In the conference room, the foreign ministers of the two countries sat in the middle, while the delegations of the two countries sat together on both sides of the table

 This demonstrated that there is mutual harmony between the authorities of the two countries

 This is the reason why Reddy accused of illegal mining is helping BJP in Karnataka

 The Education Minister said that we will soon hold talks with the teachers before implementing the dress code

 Director of Higher Education here, Amarjeet Sharma said that teachers are ideal for students

 Saree or salwar suit will be dresscode for women teachers
 iske alaava mahila shikshakon ko leging yaa genes pahanane par roak lag sakati he
 Due to such reaction coming from the mixed reactionary government coming from teachers, some teachers of the state have justified the ban on fashionable clothes

 desh ke bade shaharon main aparaadh lagaataar bad rahe hai
 In such a situation, if you ignore your safety then it can prove to be a big mistake
 ghar-baahar kahin bhi rahen, hameshaa satark or sajag rahen
 Let us know how we can protect ourselves by keeping some small things in mind
 ghar par kya karen-jab bhi ham ghar par rahete hai to bahut hi laaparvaah ho jate hai
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, some criminals carry out the crime, so whenever you stay at home, take special care of safety
 sabhi daravaajon ko lock karen
 Also do not let any stranger enter the house
 apane ghar ke taale kii chaabiyaan naukaron ke haath main naa den
 If you are alone at home, then play radio or TV so that no one can guess being alone at your house
 alevator main-alevator main jate vakt corner main khadey naa rahen
 Always stand near the doors so that you can exit immediately if needed
 lift main kisi ajanabi ke saath bahut ancomfortable mahasoos kar rahe hai to baahar nikal jaaen
 At times, showing generosity can also be expensive, so if a beggar or a disabled person is asking you something on the lonely roads, then you ignore
 car yaa parking main hone par-kai logon kii aadat hoti hai ki ve shopping, restrorent yaa offis se lautne ke baad sidhe car main baith jate hai
 Do not do this
 aap apni car main baithne se pehle thodaa satark rahen
 If driving alone and going somewhere, then lock the car lock properly
 kisi ko bhi lift naa den
 It would be better if you make the car tank full before leaving at night
 agar aap parking aria main khadey hai or uske bagal main koi badi vine he to paisanger door se car main baithiye
 You can try kidnapping from the front van while sitting in the car
 raste main-agar aap kisi raste se guzar rahe hai or aapako lag rahaa he ki koi aapkaa peechha kar rahaa he to aap turant apni disha badal lijie
 One should avoid going alone on deserted paths
 hameshaa apane cellphone ko charge karke ghar se nikalen
 In shopping malls - Always walk away from strangers in any mall or crowded shop
 raste yaa bheedbhad vaali jagahon par apane mobile main biji naa rahen balki mobile or paise apane purse main rakhen
 While exercising outdoors - Do not use earphones while walking or jogging outside
 khaskar zyada wolum par gane nahin sune
 If you do this, you will not realize if someone comes close to you
 isse logon ko yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki aap apane aas-paas kii chizon se bilkul bekhbar hai jiskaa phayda koi aaraam se uthaa saktaa he
 In dating or social events - Young girls should also take precautions while going on dating
 danceflor yaa restaroom se aane ke baad chhodkar gai hui drik ko kabhi nahin pien
 Ask the bartender for a new drink
 jab pehali baar kisi ke saath date par ja rahe ho to kisi public place par hi milen
 You must know about that person and that place
 kahin bhi akele nikalen to-khatra bhaanpane par apni bhavanaaen nazarandaaz mat kiijie
 a police department in the North Carolina state in the United States suggests: If you do not like the behavior of a person or feel hesitant to live in a place, get out of there as soon as possible
 khatra bhaanpane par aisi jagah mat rukiye
 Not under any pressure
 aatm-vishwaas se kaam lijie or satark rahiye
 To fulfill their lust, criminal elements make people especially prey to those who are straightforward and not alert
 isliye apane chalane ke tareeke se apana aatm-vishwaas zaahir kiijie
 Chennai Super Kings beat Mumbai Indians by six wickets thanks to a 109-run opening partnership between Dwayne Smith (62) and Brendon mccallum (46)
 super kings ne mumbai se mili 184 ranon ke bade lakshya ko bouna sabit karte hue chaar wicket khokar 20 gend shesh rahete hasil kar liya or ipel-8 main lagaataar teesri jeet darj kii
 See the scorecard of the match
 
 
 duusari ore mumbai indiens kii kismat ne lagaataar chauthe match main unka saath nahin diya or ipel-8 main pehali jeet se vah ab bhi dur hi rah gaye
 i did not ask anyone to bid for 16 crores: Smith and mccullum got off to a much better start than expected and made the second-highest score in the Powerplay in the IPL when the Super Kings came out to chase the Yuvraj Chennai Super Kings' innings goal
 powerple main sarvaadhik 100 ran banane kaa record bhi super kings ke hi naam he, jo unhone pichley sanskaran main kings ilevan punjab team ke khilaaf banaaya tha
 This stormy partnership between Smith and mccallum was controlled by Harbhajan Singh
 harbhajan ne aathven over kii duusari or chhathi gend par kramash: maikalam or smith ke wicket chatka daale
 mccallum catches Vinay Kumar while Smith catches Rohit Sharma
 pavilion lautne se pehle haalanki smith or maikalam ne 109 ranon kii aatishi saajhedaari kar vishaal lakshya ko aasaan bana diya
 When both batsmen returned to the pavilion, the Super Kings had scored 115 runs in eight overs and were left to score just 69 runs to win the remaining 12 overs
 maikalam ne 20 gendon main chah chauke or do chakke lagaae, jabaki smith ne 30 gendon main aath chauke or chaar chakke jade
 After this, Suresh Raina (43 not out) played a brilliant innings and led the team to victory
 raina ne 29 gendon kii apni pari main chaar chauke or do chakke lagaae
 The last run for victory was achieved by Dwayne Bravo (13 not out) hitting a six off the fourth ball of the 17th over
 super kings ke ballebaajon ke aage mumbai indiens kaa koi bhi gendbaaj prabhavit karne main naakaam rahaa
 Vinay Kumar, who gave 18 runs in two overs, was the most economical bowler, although he failed to take any wicket
 duusari ore sarvaadhik do wicket lene vaale harbhajan ne 4 overon main 44 ran lutaae
 Mumbai Indians innings before winning the toss and came to bat Mumbai Indians started very poorly and their top three batting pavilions were returned for 12 runs
 iske baad haalanki captain rohit sharma (50) ne pehle harbhajan singh (24) ke saath chauthe wicket ke liye 45 ranon or phir keeran pollard (64) ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye 75 ranon kii saajhedaari kar team ko majboot sthiti main laa khadaa kiya
 Earlier, Lendil Simmons replaced injured Aaron Finch, starting the innings with Parthiv Patel
 haalanki patel pehle hi over main khaataa khole bagaiyr ashish nehra kii gend par pagabaadha qaraar die gaye
 Nehra also caught Corey Anderson (4) in his next over at the hands of Fof du Plessis and Simmons was caught by Plessis for a personal total of five runs
 simons kaa wicket ishwar pandey ne liya
 However, Rohit and Pollard played an Atishi partnership in just 33 balls
 paanchaven number par ballebaaji karne utre harbhajan ne 21 gendon main do chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Ashish Nehra finished Rohit's innings with a catch from Dwayne Bravo just after completing the half-century off 30 balls with five fours and a six
 is bich behad aakraamak andaaj main khel rahe pollard ne 14wein over main rabindra jadeja kii gend par teen chakke lagaakar 26 gend jad daale
 Pollard shared a 49-run partnership with Ambati Rayudu (29) for the sixth wicket and brought the team to a good score
 donon hi ballebaajon ko haalanki dwen braavo ne aakhri over ke chauthe or paanchaven lagaataar do gendon par chalata kiya
 Both batsmen were caught out in an attempt to land a high shot
 raidu kaa kaich jadeja ne lapka, jabaki pollard kaa kaich dwen smith ne liya
 While Rayudu hit one four and three sixes in 16 balls, Pollard faced 30 balls and hit four fours and five sixes in his stormy innings
 super kings ke liye ashish nehra ne sabase acchhee gendbaaji kii or chaar overon main 23 ran dekar teen wicket chatkaaye
 Bravo, who took two wickets for eight runs in the last over, conceded a total of 30 runs in his spell of four overs
 team india ke thos ballebaaj cheteshwar pujaara ne bataur spin gendbaaj ravichandran aswin kii kamyaabi ke peeche kii vajah bataai he
 According to Pujara, Ashwin is such a great bowler because he thinks like batsmen
 aswin ne match ke chauthe din sabase kam maichon main 250 test wicket hasil karne kii uplabdhi puri kii
 He surpassed the record of Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee in his 45th Test, touching the figure of 250 wickets
 lily ne 48 test main 250 wicket liye the
 The comments pujaara ne bangladesh ke khilaaf test ke chauthe din kaa khel samaapt hone ke baad kaha, ‘meri raay main aswin kisi bhi pratidwandvi team ke liye sabase mushkil spinner hai
 The team now plans how they will face Ashwin
 vah (aswin) ballebaaj ke taur par sochataa he ki uski kamajori kya he or use kis line evam length main gendbaaji kerani chahie
 i think it is his experience that makes him one of the main bowlers of this team
 ’ pehali pari main aswin ne keval do wicket hasil karne ke liye kareeb 100 ran lutaae lekin pujaara ne is of spinner kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki unhen (aswin ko) ballebaajon par dabaav banane kii bhoomika di gai thi
 He said, 'he (ashwin) understands that there will be situations in which he will have to bowl a lot
 agar aap pehali pari main dekho to usne apana sarvshereshth prayaas kiya
 He bowled as a strategy
 aise bhi kuch maukey honge, jab vah wicket hasil nahin kar saktaa
 But the best thing about this Indian team is that we bowl as a unit, we bowl mostly in partnership
 aswin aisa gendbaaj he jo wicket jhatakta he or jadeja ballebaajon par dabaav banane kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Sometimes Ashwin has to play the role of preventing batsmen from scoring runs and he did so in the first innings
 ’ Pujara said after the end of the fourth day of the Test against Bangladesh, he said, 'in my opinion, Ashwin is the toughest spinner for any rival team
 team ab yojana banaati hai ki ve kis tarah se aswin kaa saamana karengi
 He (ashwin) thinks as a batsman what his weakness is and what line and length he should bowl
 mujhe lagata he ki yah uskaa anubhav he jo use is team kaa ek mukhya gendbaaj banaata he
 In the first innings, Ashwin took almost 100 runs to take only two wickets, but Pujara defended the off-spinner saying that he (ashwin) was given the role of putting pressure on the batsmen
 unhone kaha, ‘vah (aswin) samajhataa he ki aise bhi halaat honge jisamen use kasi gendbaaji kerani hogi
 If you look in the first innings, he tried his best
 usne ek ranneeti ke tahat gendbaaji kii
 There will be some occasions when he cannot get a wicket
 lekin is bhartiya team kii sabase badhiya cheez yahi he ki ham bataur ikai gendbaaji karte hai, ham zyaadaatar saajhedaari main gendbaaji karte hai
 Ashwin is a bowler who takes wickets and Jadeja plays the role of pressure on the batsmen
 kabhi kabhaar aswin ko ballebaajon ko ran banane se rokane kii bhoomika nibhaani hoti he or usne pehali pari main aisa kiya
 ' unhone kaha, ‘vah (aswin) samajhataa he ki aise bhi halaat honge jisamen use kasi gendbaaji kerani hogi

 ' supreme court ne buudhvaar ko sarkaar dwaara taiyaar gavaah sangrakshan yojana ke draft par muhar laga di he
 Once this draft is passed by the Parliament and will take the form of law, this scheme called witness protection will have to be implemented by all the states except Jammu and Kashmir
 justise e ke sikri kii aguwai vaali supreme court kii bench ne kaha ki usne is yojana ke draft main kuch badlaav kiye hai, jo centre dwaara rajyon ke paraamarsh se taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 a petition was filed in the Supreme Court today seeking protection of the witnesses in the rape case of Asaram Bapu

 Even in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Punjab retained its image of going beyond the electoral trends of the country
 darasal, punjabi matadaataaon ne 'modi lahar' par dilli main haal main hui 'kranti' ko zyada tarjeeh di or nai-naveli aam aadmi party (aap) kii jholii main ascharyajanak rup se rajya kii chaar loksabhaa siten daal deen
 But, in the 2017 assembly elections, Punjab showed that it could prove to be the Congress 'returning state'
 iske shuruaati sanket dete hue, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya ne apane 13 saansadon main se teen siton par congressiyon ko bhi chunaa
 The then ruling Shiromani Akali dal-bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance had won three Lok Sabha seats, but it was clear that the countdown to its alliance had begun in Punjab
 tab se vyas, sutluj or raavi main bahut pani bah chukaa he
 In the state assembly elections held in early 2017, Congress led by Captain Amarinder Singh won a landslide victory by putting two-thirds of the 117 seats in the assembly
 in vidhansabha chunaavon main shiromani akali dal or bhaajapa ke gathbandhan ke paanv ukhd gaye
 At the same time, AAP had already declared itself as a 'winner', but it got only 20 seats
 hameshaa kii tarah, yah anumaan lagaana kathin he ki punjab main loksabhaa 2019 chunaav main hawa kis ore bahegi, lekin vipakshi partiyon kii apni pareshaani jaise kuch kaarak maujuud hai jo ek spasht sanket dete hai
 Both AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal have been badly shaken by internal rebellions
 aap or vipaksh ke netaa sukhpal singh khera ne punjab ke sanghathan main faisle ke liye party kii punjab ikai ko zyada adhikaar die jane kii maang kii to naaraaz arvind kejariwal ne khera ko july 2018 main party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Thereafter, a small rebel group of seven AAP mlas led by Sukhpal Singh Khaira formed
 aap main aae is tufaan ne rajya main party kii sambhaavnaaon ko dhoomil kar diya
 Sukhpal Singh Khaira then formed a separate party Punjabi Ekta Party (PEP) with a small group of AAP rebels
 pieepi ab punjab loktantric gathbandhan (pidie) main shaamil hone kii prakriya main he jisamen basapa or shiromani akali dal-taksaali (akali-tii) shaamil hai
 The Taksali party is a group of veteran stalwarts of the Shiromani Akali Dal who left the Akali Dal last year protesting the 'autocratic leadership style' of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal
 taksaali khadur sahib ke saansad ranjit singh brahmpura ke netritv main, shiromani akali dal ke paaramparik sikh voton main badi send lagaakar uski sambhaavnaaon ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 In the year 2015, incidents of disobedience of Guru Granth Sahib caused a lot of resentment among Sikh devotees
 isko lekar punjab main vibhinn jagahon par virodh-pradarshan hue the
 The episode made things more difficult for Shiromani Akali Dal patron and former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal
 vah maamla ab bhi badal parivaar kaa peechha chodta najar nahin aa rahaa
 Normally, this incident of 2015 should have been dusted by now but the indications of Ranjit Singh Commission prosecuting the former Chief Minister have kept the incident going public
 rajya main congress kii nai sarkaar aane ke baad aktubar 2015 kii ghatnaon ke baad pradarshnakariyon par police firing kii jaanch ke liye ayog kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The Badal family has wisely adopted the electoral discourse of the coalition partner BJP, keeping Prime Minister Narendra Modi and national security at the center
 vastav main, apni saarvajanik baithkon main sukhbir badal lagaataar ''ek aise pradhanmantri ke liye vot karen jisase bharat ke dushman ghabaraate hai'' kii apil par jor de rahe hai
 But if any Punjab politician is showing the most enthusiasm about India's armed forces, then he is Captain Amarinder Singh
 purv sainya adhikari amarinder singh ne 1965 ke bharat-paak yuddh main sakriy rup se hissaa liya tha
 Among the people demanding retaliation after the recent Pulwama attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February, the Chief Minister of Punjab was at the forefront
 apni party ke anya sadasyon ke vipareet, unhone apane str par balakot hawaii hamalon kii safalataa ko lekar kisi bhi tarah kaa vivaad nahin khadaa hone diya he
 At the same time, analysts say that the faster the struggle between the rebel factions of these two parties to grab the Shiromani Akali Dal and aap's vote bank in Punjab, the more the Congress will gain
 congress ko satta main aae do saal hue hai or party ne nagarpalika or panchayat chunaavon main badi jeet hasil karne ke alaava, gurdaspur kii loksabhaa seat or shahkot main vidhansabha seat ke up-chunaavon main jeet darj kii he
 Obviously, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh seems confident about continuing his winning streak
 mukhyamantri kehete hai, ''ham unhen (shiromani akali dal or aap) phir se buree tarah haraa denge
 "the Congress is confident that when the voters go to cast their votes on May 19, the Punjab government's decision to waive farm loans, rein in crime and the crisis arising out of the Narendra Modi government's decision on demonetisation and Goods and Goods Tax (GST) Will inspire to vote in favor of Congress

 The chief strategist of the Shiromani Akali Dal, Sukhbir Hain Manpreet Badal, the finance minister and the staunch opponent of the Badal family, Sunil Jakhar, MP from Gurdaspur and the state Congress president, is not at all distracted by the Akali dal-bjp leadership

 However, no artist associated with the series has spoken about it
 lekin thakare ke pramotion ke dauraan navaj ne is siries ko lekar ek dilachasp kissa sunaaya he
 During a conversation with Anupama Chopra for the film Campanion, Nawazuddin talked about the second season of Sacred Games
 ek sawaal par actor ne kaha, "secred games ke duusare sijan ke liye ham kenya ke nairobi main shoot kar rahe the
 Where we were shooting, we found a British citizen who owns a very big bungalow
 ham logon kaa man tha ki uske bangale main shoot kiya jaae
 "" When our production team reached the Englishman, he inquired about us
 hamaari team ne use bataaya ki ham netflix kii series secred games se hai or aapke bangale main shoot karnaa chaahate hai
 "" There was so much to hear that the person became crazy and he gave us his bungalow without any questions and answers
 usne koi fees bhi nahin lee
 This is a proof that there is tremendous craze about Sacred Games all over the world
 ""main ye daawey ke saath kah saktaa hum ki siries kaa doosraa sizan pehle sizan se bhi bahut zyada behatar hone ja rahaa he
 i am very excited about this season and our entire team is working hard for the Sacred Games

 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has indicated his retirement from politics
 iske saath hi unhone goa jaise chote rajya main vishwasaneey netritv ke sankat ko bhi sweekaar kiya he
 The former Chief Minister of the state gave these indications at an event organized by Lokmanya Multipurpose Cooperative Credit Society on Sunday in Mapusa city, 10 km north of Goa's capital Panaji
 haalanki parrikar ne kaha ki unka dhyaan goa par hameshaa rahegaa or saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar rajya sarkaar galat raste par chalegi, to vah use sahi raste par laaenge

 On December 13, i will turn 60, so seeing this, i started thinking about it two-three years in advance

 In the Cabinet meeting today, the cabinet note related to allowance was discussed which was not expected now
 baithak ke agenda main yah mudda aaj tha hi nahin
 In this case, objection was also raised by senior government officials on the media report
 vahiin, ek union leader kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii ore aashwaasan diya gaya he ki is hafte hi is mudde ko liya jayega
 On this basis, it was being said that the government will resolve this issue this week
 pichley hafte yah khabar ai thi ki aaj kii cabinet baithak main alounces ko lekar cabinet note pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Sources in the staff unions say that the Empowered Committee of Secretaries has prepared a cabinet note after discussing the issue
 aaj kii baithak main cabinet note pesh nahin kiye jane ke peeche kaaran yah gyaat hua ki jis adhikari ko iskaa jimmaa diya gaya tha ve dilli main nahin he
 It is believed that this note would have been brought for discussion in the cabinet only when he was in Delhi
 iske peeche yah kaaran bataaya ja rahaa he ki yadi sarkaar ko jarurat padati tab is bare main unase kuch sawaal puche ja sakate the
 Let the central employees wait for the government's decision on the issue of HRA, among other allowances
 yah intjaar ab ek saal kaa hone ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on June 28 last year, the government decided to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar ne vetan ayog kii siforishein 1 janvari 2016 se lagu karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 But after several recommendations of the Pay Commission, the Central employees had raised their objection on many issues
 in muddon main alounces ko lekar vivaad bhi tha
 The government constituted a committee for this
 samiti ne apni report 27 april ko vittamantri ko saunp di thi
 This report was sent by the Finance Ministry to the committee of empowered secretaries
 ab is report par charchaa ke baad 1 june ko sachivon kii adhikaar praapt samiti ne ek cabinet note taiyaar kiya he
 It is now believed that a decision can be taken in the meeting of the Union Cabinet to be held on Wednesday
 sutron kaa kahana he ki karmchaariyon se charchaa ke liye bani lavasa samiti ne saatven vetan ayog kii alounces ko lekar kii gai kuch siforeeshon main sanshodhan ke suzav die hai
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 tippaniyan Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 ab jab ashok lavasa samiti ne apni report sarkaar ko saunp di he or jald hi vittamantri arun jetali is report par koi antim faisla sarkaar kii ore se le lenge
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 Employees say they are seeking to increase this rate
 vahiin, ek union leader kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii ore aashwaasan diya gaya he ki is hafte hi is mudde ko liya jayega

 Employees say they are seeking to increase this rate
 karmchaaree sanghon ke sutron kaa kahana he ki sachivon kii adhikaar praapt samiti ne is mudde par charchaa ke baad cabinet note to taiyaar kar liya he
 The reason behind not presenting the cabinet note in today's meeting is that the officer who was given the responsibility of this is not in Delhi
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki unke dilli main hone par hi yah note cabinet main charchaa ke liye laayaa jaataa
 The reason behind this is being told that if the government needed it, then some questions could be asked about it
 bataa den ki kendriya karmchaariyon ko anya alounces ke alaava echaare ke mudde par sarkaar ke faisle kaa intjaar he
 This wait is going to be one year now
 ullekhneey he ki pichley saal 28 june ko hi sarkaar ne saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kaa faisla liya tha
 The government had announced to implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission from 1 January 2016
 lekin vetan ayog kii kai siforeeshon ke baad kendriya karmchaariyon ne kai muddon par apni aapatti jataai thi
 There was also a dispute regarding allowances in these issues
 sarkaar ne iske liye ek samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committee submitted its report to the Finance Minister on 27 April
 vittamantralay kii ore se yah report adhikaar praapt sachivon kii samiti ko bheja gaya tha
 Now after discussing this report, on June 1, the Empowered Committee of Secretaries has prepared a cabinet note
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki har buudhvaar ko hone vaali kendriya cabinet kii baithak main is bare main faisla ho saktaa he
 Sources said that the Lavasa committee, formed for discussion with the employees, has suggested amendments in some recommendations made regarding the seventh pay commission allowances
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 The comments bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain

 karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vah is dar ko badhaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Let the central employees wait for the government's decision on the issue of HRA, among other allowances
 yah intjaar ab ek saal kaa hone ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on June 28 last year, the government decided to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar ne vetan ayog kii siforishein 1 janvari 2016 se lagu karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 But after several recommendations of the Pay Commission, the Central employees had raised their objection on many issues
 in muddon main alounces ko lekar vivaad bhi tha
 The government constituted a committee for this
 samiti ne apni report 27 april ko vittamantri ko saunp di thi
 This report was sent by the Finance Ministry to the committee of empowered secretaries

 One, trains are running late for many hours, from this time the acs of trains are also answering in this scorching heat
 aise main aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki yatriyon kii kya haalat hoti hogi
 The latest case is that of the 13152 Down jammu-kolkata Express train going from Jammu to Kolkata
 iskaa AC kharaab hone ke chalate garmi or umas se pareshaan yatriyon ne mughalsarai stesan par jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 The train stopped at Mughalsarai for more than an hour
 arpeef, jiarapy or railway ke karmchaariyon kii mashkkat ke baad train aage ke liye ravaanaa kii ja saki
 Passengers allege that the train AC was not functioning from Lucknow station already
 yatriyon ne lakhanu main bhi is baat kii shikaayat rail adhikariyon se kii lekin vahaan se unako yah kahkar taal diya gaya ki mughalsarai main asi ko thik kar diya jaayegaa
 When the train reached Mughalsarai this morning, passengers complained to the railway about this
 mughalsarai main yatriyon kii shikaayat par railway ke do maikenic bhi aaye or asi ko check kiya
 The mechanic said that the train is running very intermittently due to which the AC battery is down
 train jab puri raftaar se chalegi to asi thik kaam karnaa shuru kar degaa
 RPF and GRP jawans also reached the spot after being informed of repeated chainpulling and commotion of passengers and explained to the passengers with great difficulty
 iske baad train ko aage ke liye ravaanaa kiya ja sakaa
 Deepak Kumar Saha of Kolkata, who was traveling in the AC coach of the train, said that the AC of the train was bad

 Deepak told that we have small children with us and the heat is also very high
 vahiin mughalsarai ke arpeef ke sab inspector jai kumaar singh ne bataaya ki gaadi 13152 kii bydaree down chalane ke kaaran AC kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 Passengers were told that the AC would start functioning properly when the battery was charged
 yatriyon ke samajha-bujhaakar train ko aage ke liye ravaanaa kiya he
 However, after explaining to the passengers, the train was left for further but the big question is that in the country where trains are running late for 24-24 hours and in summer days when the AC of the train stops working
 In such a situation, the dream of bullet train will be realized
