 It may not be important to some people, but i was shocked when Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the minorities of the country in the Lok Sabha for the fact that 'they have rooted terrorist organization ISIS on this earth They did not let them freeze, but also discouraged their children
 acha lagata agar grahamantri yah badhai puure deshavaasiyon ko dete
 Why congratulate only people of a particular religion? Do only people of this religion join terrorist organizations? Are people from other religions completely clean? Is it that the Home Minister is strengthening the perception of large sections of the country that terror is related to a particular religion? It may also be that the intention of the Home Minister has not been this, but he must be cautious in choosing words
 assam ke dhubri se saasand badaruuddin ajmal kehete he ki grahamantri ko aisa nahin bolnaa chahie tha
 It seems clear that you are viewing this community through different glasses
 kahin na kahin is baat se is manyata ko bhi hawa milti he ki aatankwaad ke liye alpsankhyak hi jimmedaar he
 The UPA government had a similar thinking
 yah alag baat he ki ek khaas samudaay ko khush karne chakkar main uske netaa kai baar aise bayaan or aise kaam kar gaye ki unka zikr karnaa bhi yahaan munasib nahin he
 After the coming of the Modi government, whenever someone has asked the government about the welfare and development of minorities, it is often said that the basic mantra of our government is 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'
 ham kisi ke saath bhi dharm or varg ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahi karenge
 Then what was the need that the Home Minister had to thank the minorities in this tone? Even leaders like former Union Minister Sultan Ahmed are not digesting this statement of the Home Minister
 unka kahana he ki is bayaan se lagata he alpsankhyak desh ke baaki logon se alag hai
 It is not that this is the first case of discrimination between the majority and minorities at the government level
 sarkarein pehle bhi apane bayanon, kriyakalapon or vyavhaar main isi tarah kaa bhedbhaav karti rahi hai, lekin modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad kabhi lav jehad, to kabhi dharmantaran jaise vivaadon or kabhi sadhviyon or sadhu vastradhari netaaon ke tikhe bol saamne aane se alpsankhyak ke man main dar to paidaa ho hi gaya he
 However, former Home Secretary and now MP RK Singh defends the Home Minister, saying that this section of the society is more targeted to organizations like ISIS, so keeping this fact in mind, the Home Minister made his point
 vaise samvidhan ke mutabik or dharmik-saamaajik samarasata ke naate vakt kaa takaaza to yahi kahata he ki kam se kam sarkaar ke str par to is tarah ke vivadaspad bayanon se bachaa janaa chahie
 Now, if the governments too start giving up the thinking of fundamentalist organizations, then it is bound to generate fear of insecurity among the minorities
 khaastaur par jab pradhanmantri se lekar kai mantriyon tathaa sarkaar ke maardarshak maane jane vaale sanghathanon kaa itihaas is tarah ke bhedbhaav ko lekar paksaaf nahin rahaa ho tab to or bhi saavdhaanee baratane kii aavashyaktaa he, kyonki masalaa desh ke andambar kaa nahin he, balki kai deshon ke saath antarrashtriya kootnithik sambadhon par bhi iskaa paroksh yaa aparoksh rup se asar pad saktaa he
 It is good that the government tries to avoid such statements
 alpsankhyakon ke man main alag-thalag pad jane jaise koi bhav na aae aisi koshish sarkaar ke str se har haal main honi hi chahie, varanaa choti-choti ghatnaayen dimag main aisi tis kar jaati hai ki vah isse baahar nahin nikal pate hai or jane-anjaane main samaaj or desh virdohi tatwon / sanghathanon / soch or gatividhiyon kaa hissaa ban jate hai

 bijepi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke baad ab amit shah nirvivaad rup se swayan ko jananetaa ke rup main bhi sthapit kar chuke hai
 This is proved by Amit Shah's rallies in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections
 grahamantri ke rup main anuchhed 370 samaapt karne ke faisle kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 That is why Amit Shah emerged as a very popular leader among the people in these two states
 jansabhaon main shah ko 'hindustan kaa sher' bataaya gaya
 Among the central leaders in Maharashtra and Haryana, they were the most sought after PM Modi
 reliyon kii sankhya ke hisaab se dekhen to modi or shah ne donon rajyon ko chaan maaraa
 He went to every corner and left no stone unturned in the return of power in these states
 yah bataur grahamantri unke chote se kaarykaal main kiye gaye bade faislon kaa asar he ki shah bijepi ke star campaner ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aae hai
 Till now he had been campaigning in these states as BJP President
 lekin may main grahamantri kaa kaam sanbhaalane ke baad unke raajnneetik vyaktitv kaa ek nayaa rup saamne aayaa he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, abolishing Article 370 and Section 35A, separating Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh into a Union Territory, shutting down state politicians and restrictions on the people, they are constantly making headlines
 in donon hi rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi anuchhed 370 ke khatme ko ek bada chunavi mudda banaaya
 In the Haryana Assembly elections, Amit Shah has addressed 8 rallies while Prime Minister Modi has seven
 agar is saal hue loksabhaa chunaavon se tulana kii jaae to tab shah ne chah reliyon ko sambodhit kiya tha or piem modi ne rajya main teen reliyon ko
 Likewise, by the end of the election campaign in Maharashtra, PM must have addressed 10 rallies to Modi and Shah on 18 rallies
 shah pashchimi maharashtra main takat laga rahe hai jo congress-ensipi kaa garh mana jaataa he
 If we talk about the last assembly election, then PM Modi addressed 27 rallies and Shah more than 30
 tab bijepi ne maharashtra main shivasena se gathbandhan tod kar akele chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha or yah amit shah kaa hi faisla tha
 In this sense, he had applied more power then
 tab shah mumbai main hi deraa daal kar baithe rahe the
 BJP leaders say that this time since the goal is not to gain power but to retain power, modi-shah addressed fewer rallies than last time
 amit shah kaa badhata kad party ke bheetar bani us sahmati kii ore bhi ishaara kar rahaa he jisamen mana ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri modi sarkaar ke bade faislon or antarrashtriya sambandhon kii jimmedaari apane paas rakh kar gharelu or sarkaar se jude bade nitigat faislon kii jimmedaari amit shah ko de rahe hai
 This is when Shah has elected for the first time to the Lok Sabha
 sarkaar main kaam karne kaa isse pehle unhen gujarat sarkaar kaa anubhav tha jahaan ve modi ke mukhyamantri rahete hue unke saath bataur grih rajya mantri kaam karte the

 After the long illness and death of senior leader Arun Jaitley, PM Modi has given more responsibilities to Amit Shah
 kai cabinet mantri niyamit taur apane mantralayon ke kaamkaaj se jude faislon par charchaa ke liye shah se mulaakaat ke liye north block main dekhe jate hai
 Shah's growing stature is also evident from the fact that despite the rule of 'one man-one post' in the BJP, he holds both the Home Minister and the Party President positions as it is believed that the Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana He should be kept in this post till the election jagat prakaash nadda ko kaaryakari adhyaksh bana kar sanghathan ke rosemara ke kaam kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he

 yahi unke spikar banane kii mukhya vajah rahi he
 Message to farmers: Patole is currently a Congress MLA from Sakoli assembly seat but won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 on a BJP ticket
 maharashtra main vidarbha kshetra kaa kaaphi prabhaav he or vahaan ke kisaanon kii samasya deshbhar main charchaa kaa mudda banati hai
 In such a situation, by giving the post of speaker to a farmer leader from the same Vidarbha, Mahavikas Aghadi and the Congress Party have tried to give a message to the farmers
 chunaav ke bich bhi tamaam netaaon ne vidarbha jaakar kisaanon kaa haal janaa tha or sarkaar banane ke saath hi mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ne kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kii baat kahi thi
 In his first press conference, Thackeray had said that farmers have been asked to assess the loss and a big announcement will be made as soon as the data comes
 vidhansabha main bijepi kii ore se spikar pad kaa ummidavaar waapas lene ke baad naanaa patole ko nirvirodh spikar chunaav gaya
 On his election, CM Uddhav said that Nana Patole comes from a peasant family, so i am sure he will bring justice to all
 patole kisaan congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh hai or aise main party deshbhar main kisaan hitaishi hone ke sanket dena chaahati he
 The Mahavikas Aghadi government also intends to present Patole as the representative of the farmers in the assembly, so that farmers across the state can be assured that the government is aware of their problems
 har dal ke ajizcongress vidhayak naanaa patole pehle bijepi or shivasena main bhi rah chuke hai
 In such a situation, their acceptance is more for the Shiv Sena and the Congress involved in the government, as well as their relationship with the leaders of the opposition party BJP is considered better
 saal 2014 main patole ne bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladaa or ensipi ke diggaj netaa prafull patel ko haraaya tha
 After making a statement against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Patole left the BJP and joined the Congress again
 patole isse pehle shivasena main bhi rah chuke hai or saal 2009 main unhone kisaanon or vidarbha ke vikaas ke mudde par congress se istipha de diya tha
 He then contested as an independent candidate and secured second place
 is chunaav main ensipi ke prafull patel ko jeet mili thi
 Modi's critic in the BJP won elections on a BJP ticket in 2014, but he later accused the party of being anti-farmer
 modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal ke teen saal baad patole pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa saadhane lage the
 At an event in Nagpur, Patole had alleged that PM Modi does not listen to anyone and in the party meeting, the PM did not let him speak when he was raising the issue of farmers

 bisisiai ke adhyaksh ke chunaav kaa maamla philhal surkhiyon main he
 It is still unclear whether he will be allowed to contest the election again for the crucial post, following the curve of the Supreme Court on N
 Srinivasan, but he is constantly preparing
 vah yah daleel de rahe hai ki adaalat ne unhen chunaav ladane se nahin roka he
 It will be known only on February 14 that what is the stand of the court
 jaahir taur par agar adaalat ne nakaaratmak baaten kahin to shrinivasana ke liye daravaaje band ho jaaenge
 But those who are thinking that after this the Board of Cricket will be cleared or there will be good governance again, they are in misunderstanding because the politician's vicious and former minister Sharad Pawar has turned his eyes on it
 pavaar bisisiai kii takat or uski samruddhi kaa swaad chakh chuke hai or 2005 se 2008 tak uske adhyaksh pad par rah chuke hai
 Not only this, he has also held the position of President of the prestigious ICC from 2010 to 2012
 pavaar ab bheetar hi bheetar bisisiai adhyaksh pad ke liye apana samarthan juta rahe hai
 For this he needs the support of the eastern region, where Srinivasan is still in a strong position

 sara desh jaanata he ki upie sarkaar or maharashtra main mukhyamantri ke taur par sharad pavaar ne kaisaa kaam kiya or kya kiya
 He was always accused of serious corruption, but this clever player of politics never let his rivals attack him
 unhone apane tamaam pattey samajhadaari se phenke
 Now he is slowly preparing to come to this creamy post
 yah bhartiya cricket ke liye koi acha sandesh nahin he
 The 75-year-old Pawar has been the uncrowned emperor of manipulation and due to this he became the CM of Maharashtra in 1990 with the help of 12 independents
 yah vahi pavaar hai jinke khilaaf anna hajaare ne bhukh hadtaal kii thi
 The desire to stay in power has always shown Pawar the path to the BCCI
 yah bhartiya cricket ke liye koi shubh sanket nahin he

 ye sabase alag he or sabase bada he, isliye main ise 10 lakh se kam main nahin bechuungaa
 "tippu" is the most different, so no effort is left in his tantrums
 'tippu' kis shahana andaaj se ji rahaa he, ye isaki khuraaq se hi andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It consumes 5 kg of black gram, 4 liters of milk and 20 kg of green fodder every day
 khaane ke baad mithe main 'tippu' ko laddu chahie hi chahie varanaa iskaa mood kharaab ho jaataa he
 The cost of a day on 'tipu' is 1000 rupees

 Raj Singh said that his family had already sold donkeys for the price of three to three and a half lakhs
 bagpat ke ek kisaan ne unase saadhe teen lakh main gadhaa kharid kar aage 5 lakh rupye main bechaa

 aapako yaad hoga ki 3 saal pehle jabadillimein aam aadmi party kii sarkaar bani thi to mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ji or main aapkaa aashirwad lene aae the
 We told you that if you get your support and blessings, then we and you together will bring Delhi to the best cities of the world in the coming years, i specifically told you that what you are dreaming about the country, Such as Skill India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao etc
 unhen aapke sahyog se va apni lagan or mehnat se ham dilli main is tarah sach karke dikhaayenge ki aapako bhi garv mahasoos hoga

 aaj hamaare desh main shiksha ke kai behtareen skool or santhaan maujuud hai
 But the problem is that good education is available for only 5 percent of the children
 baaki 95 pratishat bacchon kii shiksha ke halaat behad kharaab hai, uskaa koi nunatam paimaana hi nahin he
 Most of the children in Delhi's government schools come from this 95 percent population
 ve garib hai, adhiktar mata-pita skool nahin gaye, mushkil se mehnat mazdooree karke ghar chalaate hai
 Girls are also more difficult in this
 3
 i have seen that with little resources available, many parents send their son to private school but due to lack of money, the daughter decides to get free education in government school
 in pariwaron ke bete or betiyon ke liye sarkari skool main behtareen shiksha uplabdh karana hi hamaare liye sachhee desh bhakthi he
 This is development for us
 isi vijan parkaam karte hue hamane dilli main lagaataar pichley 3 saal se shiksha par bajet kul bajet kaa kareeb 25 pratishat banaae rakhaa he
 4
 is bajet se hamane sarkari skulon main hajaaron shandaar classroom banawaye hai, unki building thik karwaai he
 Cleanliness is well maintained
 adhyapakon ko rashtriya or antarrashtriya str kii training ke liye finland, america, rus, britain va singapore aadi deshon main bheja he
 For children who are unable to read their books properly, they have organized successful programs like Challenge, Mission Foundation
 skulon main aapas main seekhney kaa vaataavaran banane ke liye menter teacher program shuru kiya he
 Conducted mega-ptm continuously to further enhance the role of parents
 padhaane or pariksha lene ke taur-taraakon main buniyadi parivartan kiye hai haal hi main dilli main 5 skool of excilence shuru kiye hai, jo garib logon ke bacchon ko sarkari skool main mil sakane vaali suvidhaon or padhai ke str kaa ek model he

 chaar din pehle achaanak aapane meri salaahkaar aatishi marlina ko barkhaast kar diya
 Atishi Marlina is the consultant with whom we thought about all the above efforts, implemented them and were able to implement them successfully
 aatishi marlina khud dilli ke saint stephen college kii topper rahi hai
 She then pursued a Masters in Education from Oxford University, receiving internationally renowned road-scholarships and evening-scholarships
 desh ke sarv pratishthit rishi vaili skool main adhyaaapak ke rup main bhi unhone kaam kiya, pichley 3 saal se vah mere saath shiksha mantri kii salaahkaar ke rup se kaary kar rahi thi
 In lieu of this, she used to take a salary of only one rupee
 aisi samarpit desh bhakt or shikshit pratibhashali mahila ko dilli ke bacchon kii shiksha ke moulik kaam se barkhaast kar aap kya sandesh dena chaahate hai
 6
 hamaare desh main shiksha kii vyavastha main nirnay lene vaale, yojana banane vaale or unhen amal main laane vaale shiksha mantri, shiksha sachiv yaa shiksha nideshak main se kisi kaa bhi shiksha visheshgy hona athwa shiksha anbhavi hona aavashyak nahin he
 In my opinion, this is one of the major reasons for the collapse of the government school system across the country
 hamane dilli sarkaar main isliye aatishi marlina jaisi sushikshit evam anbhavi mahila ko shiksha salaahkaar ke rup main rakhaa
 Its results also came to light
 aaj puure desh main hamaare sabase kattar virdohi bhi is baat ko maanate hai ki dilli sarkaar ne 3 saal main shiksha par behtareen kaam kiya he or sarkari skulon kii kaaya palatney lagi he
 7
 mujhe aashcharya he ki aapaki sarkaar ne ek jatke main jis tarah aatishi marlina ko dilli ke shiksha mantri kii salaahkaar se hataane kaa aadesh jari kiya, usase aap kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai? aapke hamase raajnneetik virodh ho sakate hai lekin dilli ke bacchon se to nahin
 Children of Delhi are also children of this country, when you call yourself a patriot, then how can your patriotism be fulfilled without the children of Delhi? Which country is devotion to remove people engaged in betterment of their education due to political opposition? 8
 aap apane raajnneetik virodhiyon ko parrast karne ke liye sam-daam-dand-bhed kii niti apnaane main kabhi koi kasar nahin chhodte
 You are the Prime Minister of the country right now
 aap ke paas satta kii takat he or nasha he
 You can use the power of power to stop any good work in the country
 lekin sochiega jarur ki ek din ham sabko bhagwaan ke saamne janaa he or use jawaab dena he ki jab aap satta ke istemaal se desh ke bacchon ko acchhee shiksha dilava sakate the tab aap shiksha ke vikaas main roda banakar kyon khadey hue? main to do tihaai rajya kaa adana sa shiksha mantri hum
 In spite of all the hurdles, i have made 8000 splendid new class rooms in Delhi
 aapkaa badppan tab hota jab aap puure desh main 2 lakh nae shandaar class room banavaate
 i have opened 14 new colleges in Delhi
 aapkaa badppan tab hota jab desh bhar main 14 hajaar nae college khulavaate
 9
 main aapako nimantran detaa hum ki aap dilli ke skulon ko dekhne ke liye kisi bhi din mere saath dilli ke sarkari skulon main chaliye
 i want to show you how much happiness is reflected in the faces of the children of the country by building good schools
 main aapako dikhaanaa chahta hum ki dilli kii shiksha main hamane kya badlaav kiya he
 While on the post of President, then President Pranab Mukherjee has visited Delhi government schools twice on my invitation and at my request, he also taught history class in government schools
 main aapako bhi nimantran detaa hum ki dilli ke sarkari skool or collejon main khule man se aaie or phir desh bhar main aise hi khub saare skool banavaaie
 10
 pradhanmantri ji! meraa aapse anurodh he ki lakeer ke saamne badi lakeer khinchakar bada banie
 You cannot become big by erasing the front with equal value
 aatishi marlina ko dilli kii shiksha mantri ke salaahkaar se hataakar aapane mujhe nahin, dilli ke bacchon ke bhavishya ko bhi mitaane kii koshish kii
 People say you are a yogi
 dhyaan-yoga karte hai
 If you sit in meditation this time, then keep in mind the faces of the children of Delhi
 unka aapse sawaal he- agar aap hamen kuch de nahin sakate to, jo hamaare liye ho rahaa he use rokie mat

 April 13 is a date to say, but this day tells such a painful story of the atrocities of the British rule, which makes humanity ashamed
 is din amritsar ke jaliyanvaala baag main gore hukmaranon ne kareeb do hajaar hindustaniyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 It is in those days of 1919, that the freedom struggle against the British rule was in full swing and the government had enacted a black law called the Rowlatt Act to suppress the voice of the freedom fighters
 is kanoon ke tahat kisi ko bhi maamla darj kiye bina giraftaar kiya ja saktaa tha
 According to Professor Chaman Lal, former president of the Indian Language Center at Jawaharlal Nehru University and who has written several books on the freedom struggle, the Rollat act was widely opposed across India and many Indian members of the provincial councils resigned from their posts in protest
 unke anusaar jab sarkaar ne lokapriy netaa dow
 Satyapal and Saifuddin Kitchloo were arrested, and discontent erupted all over the country
 in giraftaareyon tathaa rolat act ke virodh main 13 april, 1919 ko baisakhi ke din amritsar ke jaliyanvaala baag main ek shantipurna sabha rakhi gai
 The government adopted various tactics to thwart the meeting
 sabha main bhaag lene mumbai se amritsar aa rahe mahatma gandhi ko palaval railway stesan par giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Angry thousands of people reached the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on April 13, 1919
 is sabha se tilamilaae punjab ke tatkaaleen governor maaikel odwair ne brigadier general rejinald diar ko aadesh diya ki vah hindustaniyon ko sabak sikhaa den
 At this, General Dyer surrounded Jallianwala Bagh with 90 soldiers and as soon as the assembly started, indiscriminate firing from the firefighting started
 ve lagbhag 10 minute tak nihathe logon par goliyaan barasaate rahe
 His guns were not silenced until his bullets ran out
 baag teen ore se unchi-unchi deevaaron se ghira tha or isamen aane-jane kaa ek hi rasta hone kii vajah se log bhaag bhi nahin paae
 To save lives, many people jumped into the well in the park, but they also did not survive and died due to drowning in the water
 bahut se log bhagdad main maare gaye
 On the plaque in the garden it is written that 120 bodies were found only from the well
 sarkari aankadon main marane waalon kii sankhya 379 bataai gai, jabaki pandit madan mohan malviya ke anusaar kam se kam 1300 log maare gaye the
 According to Swami Shraddhanand, the death toll was more than 1500
 amritsar ke tatkaaleen civil sarjan ke mutabik maut kaa yah aankada 1800 se zyada tha
 The incident was condemned worldwide, but General Dyer said it was necessary to teach people a lesson
 britain ke ek akhbaar ne ise aadhunik itihaas kaa sabase nrushans hatyakand qaraar diya
 Dyer took the lives of freedom lovers, but after this massacre, the people's desire to get freedom became even stronger
 aazaadee ke diwaanon ke man main itani aag bhar gai ki ve jaan kii parvaah kiye bina swatantraaa ke havankund main kudane lage
 Angry over the incident, Udham Singh swore that he would avenge the incident by killing Michael Odwire
 13 march 1940 ko unki yah pratigya puri hui or unhone landan ke coxton haal main odwair ko goliyon se bhun daalaa
 On the other hand, General Dyer died after suffering from various diseases

 (special on Jallianwala Bagh Massacre on April 13) argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan par savarnon ko aarakshan ke naam par murkh banane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He said that Narasimha Rao's government had made a law of 10 percent reservation for the economically poor, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in 1992
 shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki atal ji kii sarkaar ne bhi is masale par vichaar karne ke liye ek samiti banaai thi
 But there was no conclusion
 darasal hamaara samvidhan aarakshan kaa aadhaar saamaajik or shaikshanik pichhadaapan ko maanata he
 Apart from this, how much representation is given in the government jobs in proportion to the population of the castes to be given reservation
 argedy netaa shivanand tiwari ne patna main bayaan jari kar kaha ki sarkari naukariyon main savarnon kaa pratinidhitiv unki aabaadi ke anupaat se kahin zyaada he
 Ram Vilas Paswan is justified by all these facts
 phir bhi savarna aarakshan kii baat kahkar unako bevaqoof banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The problem of poverty and unemployment is extremely serious even among the upper castes
 lekin unako samajhnaa hoga kiberojgaare kaa samadhanaarakshan se nahin hone vaala he
 The RJD leader said that the total government jobs in the country are around 1
5 crore
 jo hamaari aabaadi kaa lagbhag dedh pratishat hai
 Then there is the widespread problem of unemployment and poverty among the youth of the castes who get reservation
 isliye samajhnaa hoga ki berojgaare or garibi kaa ilaaj aarakshan nahin he
 It should be understood that the castes that get reservations constitute around 75 percent of the country's population
 lekin unke liye aarakshan kii adhiktam seemaa 49
 5 percent
 jabaki saamaanya jatiyon kii aabaadi 15 pratishat he
 But 50 indirectly for them
 5 aarakshan he
 Tiwari said that according to the Supreme Court's decision, even though reserved category candidates score more than the general category candidates, they will be counted in reserved category only
 isliye aarakshan kaa virodh kisi bhi aadhaar par nyyochit nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Rather it will create a new kind of confrontation in the society
 isliye desh ke naujavaanon ko jati-dharm ke ghere se upar uthakar berojgaare ke kilaaf sangharsh karnaa chahie
 The slogan should be that the basis of the test of development of the country is not GDP but creation of employment
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan aarthik aadhaar par savarnon ko aarakshan dene kaa mudda lagaataar uthaate rahe hai

 The controversy has escalated after Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan raised slogans of Bajrang Ali in a public meeting on Friday
 purv main yah maamla upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi uthaa chuke hai jisamen unhone kaha tha ki congress or sapa gathbandhan ke liye ali hai lekin unke liye bajrang bali hai

 com / d4jonljllp — Chowkidar Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp) April 13, 2019 Azam Khan raised the slogan of 'bajrang Ali' instead of Bajrangbali raising the issue of Ali and Bajrang Bali in Rampur
 saath hi unhone piem modi par pakistan kaa agent hone kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Addressing a general meeting, Azam Khan said that Pakistan's PM Imran Khan has given a statement that if PM Modi comes to power again, the dispute between the two countries will be resolved
 ajam khan ne kaha ki modi-imran kii ye kisi mileebhagat he?rampur se sapa ummidavaar ne aage piem modi ko aade haathon lete hue kaha, "aap kal navaj sharif ke dost the or aaj imran khan aapke dobaaraa pradhanmantri banane kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Tell people i am an agent of Pakistan or an agent of Pakistan
 
 
 "
 Significantly, as elections are approaching, the leaders have intensified the phase of allegations
 sabase pehle upi ke mukhyamantri ne bajrang bali kii jati bataai jis par hangaamaa hua
 He later associated Bajrang Bali with the BJP and Ali with the Congress and SP alliance to which the opposition parties went to the Election Commission and complained
 shuukravaar ko sapa netaa ajam khan ne is vivaad ko nai hawa di or ek jansabha main bajrang ali kaa naaraa lagavaaya
 Giriraj Singh retaliated on this and said that after the elections he will tell Azam Khan in Rampur who is Bajrang Bali

 During the hearing of the case, General Secretary of All India Rager Mahasabha Chhatar Singh Rachhoya told Judge Punit Nagpal that BSP supremo Mayawati has done the work of hurting Hindu sentiments by comparing herself to God
 yachikakarta chatar singh rachhoya ne kaha, 'mayawati ne supreme court main halafanama daayar kar khud kii tulana bhagwaan se kii he
 Therefore, the court should direct the police to register an FIR against Mayawati
 haalanki court ne is arji par kuch karne ke bajaay yachikakarta ko hi ilaake ke dm se sampark karne ke nirdesh diya he
 Also deferred hearing of the case
 court ne yachikakarta chatar singh rachhoya se kaha, 'maamle main aap apane ilaake ke dm ko aavedan den, jisase rajya yaa centre sarkaar se cese chalaane kii ijaajat mil jaae
 According to the court, to run the case, permission from either the state government and the central government is required
 ab 31 july ko court is maamle kii agali sunwaayee karegaa
 Let me tell you that the whole matter is about the affidavit filed by Mayawati in the Supreme Court, in which Mayawati has compared herself to Lord Ram
 mayawati kii daleel he ki unhone puri jindagi shaadi nahin kii or apane puure jivan ko bahujan mishan ke saath jodne kaa faisla kiya
 In her affidavit to the Supreme Court, Mayawati said that when the statue of Lord Rama of 221 meters can be installed at government expense, then why can't her statue be installed? BSP supremo Mayawati did not stop here in her affidavit recently a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat has also been questioned on a slip of Rs 3000 crore
 mayawati kaa maananaa he ki unhone apni murtiyon isliye lagavai, kyonki unke samaaj ke log aisa karke gauravanvit anubhav karte hai
 In a 20-year cricket career, Imran Khan gave excellent performance and took Pakistan to new heights

 The BJP is outspoken demanding his resignation from the PM
 lekin, ab congress bhi chup baithne ko taiyaar nahin
 On Monday, the PM broke the silence, and on Tuesday, Congress President Sonia Gandhi issued a decree to attack his leaders
 congress sansadeey dal kii baithak main sonia kaa akraman kaa aahvaan pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke us shairana jawaab ke bilkul vipareet he
 Sonia Gandhi understood that now playing on the backfoot is no use
 frontroot par aate hue unhone bijepi par blakemeling kaa iljaam jad diya
 Not just in Parliament, Sonia now wants to take this political struggle to the road
 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav hona he, sonia ne farmaan sunaaya he netaa sadakon par utren or bijepi ke iljaamon kaa jawaab den
 If Sonia made a ruckus on the BJP, the BJP also took aggressive measures
 bijepi ne saaf kar diya he ki piem ke istife kii maang se wo rattibar bhi peeche nahin hategi
 After the quarrel in the Parliament over coal, now the fight between Congress and BJP has come on the streets
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bijepi par blakemeling kaa aarope lagaaya to bijepi ne palatwaar main jaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 The BJP also brushed off Sonia's appeal in which she appealed to her leaders to be aggressive and take to the streets
 bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main party ne saaf kar diya ki janata ke bich jaakar bhrashtachar ke muddon wo sarkaar ke khilaaf deshvyapee pradarshan karegi
 In this episode, the BJP attacked the Congress through some documents on Tuesday
 ye or baat he ki congress netaa kol block aavanton main bijepi ko bhi katghare main khadaa kar rahe hai
 Where on one side, Sonia has now taken command in order to get the government out of the crisis
 is silsile main wo sansad kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle loksabhaa ke bheetar samaajawaadee supremeo mulaayam singh se baatcheet bhi kii
 This is the second time in the monsoon session of Parliament when Sonia has called for an attack to save the government from crisis
 sonia ke badale tevar kii jhalak pehali baar 8 agast ko mili thi, jab bijepi ke senior netaa laalkrishna adwani ke khilaaf khud morcha khol diya tha
 Seeing his aggressive attitude, other Congress mps also adopted the attacking attitude
 lekin, sawaal uthta he ki is waar or palatwaar se desh ko kya milegaa? jo bahes sansad main honi chahie, wo sansad ke baahar kyon? sansad kii kaarywahi janata ke paise se chalati he? aise main kaaryvahi rokkar koun kar rahaa he blackmel?sushamaa swaraj ke motaa maal vaale bayaan par congress kii tikhi pratikriya kaa bhi bijepi ne jawaab diya he
 The BJP has got the letter dated 5 February 2008 in which Subodh Kant Sahay, a minister in the central government, had allotted a coal block to his brother after making a recommendation in the PMO
 subodhakant sahay ne piem ko ek chitthee likhi or SKS ispaat limited ko kol block aavantit karne kii sifarish kii
 The PMO also extended this recommendation to the Ministry of Coal on 6 February without delay
 iske agle hi din SKS ispaat limited ko kol block aavantit kar diya gaya
 The Congress is surrounded by allegations and the BJP is not in a soft mood
 lekin, ye vidambnaa nahin to or kya jis baat par bahes sansad main honi chahie
 There is a struggle in front of the TV cameras on that issue
 kya hamaare mananeey saansad ahan kii ladaai chhod baatcheet ke mej par masalaa nahin sulajhaa sakate? kya is shah maat ke khel main wo janata ke hiton kii bali nahin de rahe hai? jawaab agar bijepi ko dena he to sarkaar bhi is sawaal se batch nahin sakati
 Because the government can reject the bjp's allegations, how can it defy the report of a constitutional body like the CAG? shaadi sijan ke bich agar aap sone kii kharidari kii soch rahe hai to aapke liye buree khabar he

 He further explained that around 60-65 per cent of financial business in the world is in dollars
 lihaaja, dollar main kamajori aane se niveshkon kaa rujhaan sone ke prati badhata he kyonki yah niveshak kaa surakshit jariya he
 According to Kedia, there is an atmosphere of tension between the US and Iran after the recent Gulf region incident
 jab kabhi bhuraajnneetik tanaav badhata he yaa kinhin vajahon se aarthik gatividhiyaan kamjor hoti hai to niveshak stock ke bajaay sone main nivesh ke prati utsahit hote hai lihaaja sone main teji kaa rujhaan bana hua he

 Actually, Himanshu Roy's claim is based on the 4 thousand emails that Yasin Bhatkal and his bosses in Pakistan have sent to each other
 roy ne kaha, 'hamaare paas thos saboot hai ki aatanki hamale pakistan dwaara pryojit the

 ranjai trophy final match main hetric lene vaale vidarbha ke tej gendbaaj rajnish gurbani ne kaha ki vah gendbaaji main gati badhaane par kaam kar rahe hai
 Vidarbha bowled Delhi for 295 in the first innings on the second day of the match with a hat-trick of Gurbani (six wickets for 59 runs)
 isse pehle gurbani ne karnataka ke khilaaf match main 12 wicket jhatak kar team kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi

 Gurbani said he did not remember about it before the hat-trick ball
 unhone kaha, ‘main bhul gaya tha ki mere paas hetric kaa mauka he

 There is a big disclosure in the case related to the fire in the Thursday Metro Hospital in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, adjacent to Delhi
 metro aspataal main pani bujhane kaa yantra sirf basament main hi maujuud tha, jabaki upare maalon par aag bujhane kii koi suvidha nahin thi
 It is clear that the hospital's negligence was revealed during the investigation
 guuruuvaar ko jab aspataal main aag lagi thi, tab vahaan kai marij bhartee the
 In the shortcomings of the hospital administration, it has been found that the sprinklers used to extinguish the fire were only in the basement
 upar ke floor par sprinclers kii suvidha nahin thi
 According to the fire officer, all the equipment to extinguish the fire was not sufficient
 2018 main sprincolor naa hone ke kaaran fire license ko rineau nahin kiya gaya or aspataal ko NOC nahin mili thi
 The fire department had issued a notice to the hospital regarding this, but no response was received
 aspataal main ek hi floor par hydrant tha, jabaki aria ke hisaab se har floor par do hydrant hone chahie
 There was no fire exit on one floor
 fire adhikari kii maane to aag bujhane kaa kaam jin hydrents se kiya jaataa tha vah paryaapt maatra main nahin the inhen hydrant se aag bujhaai jaati he jisamen horse pipe lagati he
 According to the officer, the Fire Department will issue notice to the hospital under the Limitation Act, if the deficiencies are not resolved, the matter may go to court
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko noida ke sector 12 main sthit metro aspataal main aag lag gai thi
 During this time, about 3 dozen patients were trapped, who were taken out by breaking glass panes
 aspataal main puri tarah dhuaan bhar jane ke kaaran marijon ko kaaphi pareshaani hui or jald hi unhen sector 11 main sthit aspataal kii anya branch main shift kiya gaya
 When the Air Asia ship landed from Delhi on March 10 at Dabolim Airport, Manohar Parrikar resolved that he would no longer go to Delhi again
 unhen puraa yakeen tha ki ve teesri baar goa ke mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalenge
 And on 14 March, he took the oath with the support of 22 mlas - 13 from BJP, 3 from Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), 3 from Goa Forward and three Independents
 lekin isi ke saath unhone un logon ke bich apana cheharaa or apana vishwaas bhi gavaan diya, jo lambey samay se unhen apana hero samajhate the
 Congress Legislature Party leader Chandrakant Kavlekar immediately approached the Supreme Court but rejected Kavlekar's application
 court kaa kahana tha ki congress ko bahumat dikhaane ke liye rajyapal mridula sinha ko aashwast karnaa chahie tha
 However, Parrikar did not get this reward easily
 unhen or kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ko emjeepi, goa forward or nirdaleeyon ko sarkaar banane main madad karne ke liye raji karne ko 11 march kii puri raat samet 16 ghante jagakar bitaane pade
 An insider from the BJP explained how the personal relationship and caste politics had both bettered and persuaded mgp's Sudin Dhavalikar, Goa Forward's Vijay Sardesai and Independent Rohan Khaunte — all three Brahmins — to support him
 ek anya nirdaleey govind gaude ne bhi bhaajapa kaa saath diya, kyonki bijepi ne priyole vidhansabha seat par unka samarthan kiya tha, jahaan unhone sudin ke chote bhai deepak ko haraa diya tha
 Another independent Prasad Gaonkar also supported the BJP after Sinha made Parrikar as Chief Minister
 goa kii sarkaar hameshaa se hi nai dilli ke paison par nirbhar rahi he
 And this dependency is further increased when the state government does not have majority in the assembly
 yahi vajah he ki sahyogi dalon or nirdaleey vidhayakon ne bijepi ke saath jane kaa faisla kiya
 Earlier small parties used to go with the Congress, because then it was in power at the Center
 ab parrikar ne sahyogi dalon se vaada kiya he ki ve dilli main apane sambandhon ke chalate goa ke liye zyada paisa hasil kar lenge
 Not only this, they will also ensure for the ambitious Dhavalikar that they get the department they want, ie their favorite Public Works Department
 dhawalikar pehle parrikar ke virdohi subhash weylingkar ke mitra hua karte the
 Velingkar was the former RSS chief in Goa, who formed the Goa Suraksha Manch to defeat the BJP
 dhawalikar ke bhaajapa kaa saath dene ke baad weylingkar kaa kahana tha, ''emjeepi ek swatantra party he
 They are free to take any decision
 ham angreji madhyam ke skulon ko anudaan dene ke khilaaf apana andolan jari rakhenge
 "parrikar has appointed three mlas of Goa Forward, Khaunte and Gowde as ministers
 10 sadasyon kii cabinet main keval teen vidhayak bhaajapa ke hai
 In return, the party will have to elect the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker
 baharhaal, sarkaar banane ke baad parrikar ke liye sabhi ko saath banaae rakhana kathin chunauti hogi
 Especially Sardesai, who is equally ambitious and was the most vocal of the opposition legislators in the earlier government and used to target Parrikar, calling him a "fixer"
 ve party adhyaksh prabhakar timbale or bahut-se kaaryakartaaon kii marji ke khilaaf jaakar bhaajapa main shaamil hue hai
 But they had no way
 fatorada main apana ummidavaar utarkar congress ne unke saath dhokhaa na kiya hota to saradesai or do anya vidhayakon ne sarkaar banane ke liye party kaa samarthan kar diya hota
 Sardesai says, "I know that my party people are angry with my decision, but i have to respect the public's decision
" "pichley do varshon main parrikar party sanghathan main akkhad ravaiye or apana vaada bhul jane ke liye badnaam ho chuke hai
 Ever since he has met his promise to withhold funding from English-medium schools and throw casinos into the sea, his reputation has been in a doldrums
 ab unhen yah dikhaanaa hoga ki ve kaam karne vaale vyakti hai, na ki sirf vaada karne vaale
 For example, in the campaigning for the assembly elections, Parrikar had announced that the central government's plan for each house would first start in Madgaon and Juwari Nagar
 unhone juvari nagar main kaha tha, ''aap dekhenge ki 2019 main makaanon ke nirmaan kaa kaam shuru ho jayega
 “they must now prioritize this plan
 unhen rojgaar paidaa karne ke kaam ko bhi teji se badhanaa hoga
 Apart from this, many types of tourism will have to be promoted, from environment to medical, heritage, religious, adventure and rural tourism will also have to be promoted
 bhaajapa ne apane ghoshnaa patr main vaada kiya tha ki vah dawa, electronics, menuphaccharing or soochna praudyogiki ke kshetron main pradooshanrahit udyog lagaaegi
 Parrikar will have to concentrate on implementing the promises of the manifesto
 goa ko khanan par pratibandh ke kaaran pehle hi 20 pratishat rajasav kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Despite huge loss of income, the government has continued social welfare schemes
 parrikar ko aamadani badhaane or rajya kii arthvyavastha ko patari par laane ke liye nae vikalpon kii talash kerani hogi
 Apart from this, even though Parrikar has managed to muster the required numbers for a majority in the House, his qualification will be tested in the presence of experienced Congress mlas sitting in the opposition
 paanch purv mukhyamantri—pratapsingh rane, digambar kaamat, ravi nike, luijinho falerio or churchill alemao—ko dayanand sopte, subhash shirodekar, isidore furnandis, or neelkant halarnakar kaa samarthan hoga, jo 10 saal ke antaraal ke baad vidhansabha main laute hai
 Meanwhile, the Congress will have to maintain solidarity, as its six mlas are openly expressing their displeasure over their inability to stake claim to form the government despite being the single largest party in the House
 pehle hi atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki ve congress kaa saath chhodkar bhaajapa main shaamil ho sakate hai
 The election results also show that Parrikar's magic is fading
 unhone sanguem main bhaajapa ummidavaar subhash phaldesai ke liye ghar-ghar jaakar chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 But voters won Independent candidate Prasad Gaonkar by a margin of 937 votes
 parrikar ne poravorim main khanvate ke asar ko rokane ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor laga diya tha, par is prabhaavshaalee nirdaleey ummidavaar ko ek hi jagah se do baar jeet hasil karne se nahin roak paae
 Khaonté is the first independent candidate in Goa who has won the election twice in a row
 parrikar ko unhen apni cabinet main shaamil karnaa padaa, jabaki unhone chunaavon main unke khilaaf athak prachaar kiya tha
 The number of BJP mlas in Goa has come down in five years, while these five years have been the best in terms of basic development, social welfare and healthcare
 parrikar ke liye sabase pehali or sabase badi chunauti bijepi ke vafaadaar matadaataaon kaa bharosa phir se jeetne kii hogi, jo is baar emjeepi or nirdaliyon kii taraf chale gaye the
 BJP won 34 in 2012 with 21 seats
 7 pratishat vot hasil kiye the
 In 2017, its vote percentage decreased to 32
 9 pratishat ho gaya
 In contrast mgp's vote percentage of 6
 7 pratishat se badhkar 11
 3 percent
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki konkani bhashi hindu, jo paramparaagat rup se bhaajapa ke samarthak rahe hai, konkani kii jagah angreji ko badhaava dene kii sarkaar kii niti se buree tarah naaraaz the
 This time he decided to support MGP
 emjeepi kaa bhi hinduon ke bich acha-khaasaa aadhaar he or vah jiesem ke saath thi
 Ramakant Kerkar, a supporter of Goa Forward, says the BJP suffered due to the issue of the medium of official business and the arrogance of its ministers
 parrikar sweekaar karte hai ki bhaajapa ke kuch ummidavaaron ko satta virdohi tagdi lahar kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 "people were not angry with the BJP as a party, but were unhappy about some candidates," he says
 ek choti vidhansabha seat par 2,000 se 3,000 vot bhi nattejey badal sakate hai
 "keeping in mind the anti-incumbency sentiments, the BJP fielded candidates leaving the Congress in Mayem (praveen Jante), Kumbarajua (pandurang Madakkar) and Dabolim (mauvin Godinho)
 usne khel mantri ramesh tawarkar ko tikat nahin diya, or iskaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Tawadkar rebelled and helped defeat BJP candidate Vijay Pai Khot
 purv mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar or teen anya pramukh mantri—rajendra arlekar, dayanand manderekar or dilip parulekar—chunaav haar gaye
 Parsekar had to pay for the charges of being isolated and land grab in the name of Electronic City
 arlekar jahaan aksham the, vahiin manderekar or parulekar ko mukhya rup se unke baahubal ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 Parrikar's failure to remove them proved costly for the BJP, especially in its stronghold in North Goa
 2012 main usne yahaan 21 main se 12 siten jiti thim
 Which reduced to eight this time
 darasal bhaajapa ne agar catholic ummidavaaron ko tikat na diya hota to uske sadasyon kii sankhya ek ank main hi simat gai hoti
 This will be the first time that bjp's Catholic mlas will outnumber Hindu mlas
 bhaajapa ke 13 vidhayakon main saat vidhayak—francis dyisuja, neelesh cabral, maaikel lobo, glen tiklo, alina sailadanha, godinho or jose louis carlos almeida—catholic hai
 Parrikar has often said that he prefers Goa's fish curry over Delhi's butter chicken
 lekin is baar is kari kaa majaa lenaa mushkil sabit ho saktaa he
 Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir has strongly criticized the incident of boycott by political parties and the infiltration of terrorists by the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat elections
 unhone kaha ki yah behad durbhagyapurna he ki kuch dal soobe main hone vaale panchayat chunaav kaa bahishkaar kar rahe hai
 He has welcomed the parties participating in this election
 unhone kaha ki kai dal or log chunaav main hissaa le rahe hai, jiskaa ham swaagat karte hai
 On the question of withdrawal of nomination, he said that it is not new
 namakan waapas hote hi rahete hai
 There is talk of withdrawal of nominations in elections across the country including Delhi
 isko aatankiyon kii varning kaa khauf nahin maananaa chahie
 He said that people have filled the form for election nomination
 haalanki yah sahi he ki namakan karaane waalon kii sankhya kam rahi he
 There is democracy here
 lihaaja chunaav hona chahie
 Due to elections, democracy will remain and people will be able to live in the shadow of peace
 saath hi ilaake kaa vikaas hoga
 The Union Minister said that due to non-election in Jammu and Kashmir, development works are hindered
 vikaas kaary ke liye paisa pahunch nahin paata he
 In response to a question, he said that leave aside the talk of PDP and National Conference
 inhone chunaav kaa bahishkaar kaa nirnay lekar thik nahin kiya he

 a post shared byajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) onapr 11, 2019 at 9:23 pm PDT Ajay is currently awaiting the release of his upcoming film De De Pyar De
 unki film tanaji: da ansang warrior bhi jald aegi
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, the acting Tanushree Dutta had provoked Ajay Devgan to work with Aloknath accused in the Meetu campaign
 tanushri ke tanj se naaraaz ajay ne safai dete hue kaha ki film de de pyaar de main alokanath vaale hisse kii shooting aaropon ke ujagar hone se pehle hi khatm ho chuki thi
 It was not possible to reshoot them
 jald hi vyavsaayik vaahanon ke liye fastag or trekking system lagaana anivaary ho saktaa he
 The central government has prepared a draft for this
 sarkaar iske liye motor whical act main badlaav kar sakati he
 Several other changes are also discussed in this draft
 draft ke mutabik driving license or pradooshan niyantran pramaan patr (PUC) kii digital form main rakhane kii suvidha die jane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 This facility will be available with the facility of keeping these documents in physical form
 iske saath hi registration ke vakt nai gadiyon kaa fitness praaanpatr kii anivaaryta ko khatm karne par jor diya gaya he
 According to the draft, commercial vehicles that have a national permit will have to install the Fastag on their wind screen under any circumstances
 neshnal hive par bane toll get par fastag gadiyon ke liye alag se len kii vyavastha hoti he
 It is necessary to write the vehicles that obtain the National Permit National Permit will be required to write in capital letters in front of or behind the National Permit Vehicle
 bade vaahanon main trailor ke peeche or bain ore enpi likhnaa hoga
 Vehicles carrying heavy goods will have to be painted in white
 aise vaahanon ke peeche lite ko riflact karne vaali takhten lagaani hongi
 No fitness certificate is required
 This provision has also been brought in the draft that it will not be necessary to show the fitness certificate of new trains at the time of registration
 registration kii taarikh ke baad se unke paas 2 saal ke liye pramaan patr maujuud rahegaa
 Eight year old vehicles and older vehicles will be given fitness certificate of two years and one year respectively
 sarkaar ke aalaa mantriyon ne saaf kiya he ki modi sarkaar main kisi bhi mantri ko pradhanmantri kii gaiyrhaajari main kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak kii adhyakshata karne ke liye adhikrut nahin kiya gaya he
 This simply means that no minister has been given the number two position during the foreign visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki pradhanmantri modi kii brazil yatra kii shuruyaat se pehle cabinet sachivalay kii ore se ek note jari kiya gaya he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki behad jaruri maamalon par cabinet kii raajnneetik maamalon kii samiti yani sisipie faisle karegi
 The CCPA has ten more ministers besides the Prime Minister, including six from BJP and four from allies
 ek varisht mantri ke mutabik, pradhanmantri chaahe desh main rahe yaa videsh main vah pradhanmantri hi hota he or isiilie kisi anya mantri ko duusare number kaa darja dene kii jarurat nahin he
 As far as the issues arising in the Parliament are concerned, the Parliamentary Affairs Cabinet Committee meets daily during the session
 pradhanmantri ke desh main rahane par unke karyaalay main ye baithak hoti he
 Whereas in his absence, this meeting is held in the office of the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, in which the strategy is decided on the possible issues arising in Parliament
 is samiti main pradhanmantri ke alaava grahamantri rajnath singh raksha or vittamantri arun jetali sansadeey kaarymantri em venkaiya naidu or bhootal parivahan mantri nitin gadakari shaamil hai
 There is also going to be a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party in the absence of the Prime Minister, which is called by the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Naidu
 isamen varishthatam netaa hone ke naate laalkrishna adwani loksabhaa main sansadeey dal ke up netaa hone ke naate rajnath singh rajya sabha main sansadeey dal ke upanetaa hone ke naate arun jetali or sansadeey kaarymantri baithak kii aguwai karenge
 It is worth noting that the BJP Parliamentary Party executive has also been formed, in which Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley have been made deputy leaders
 yani donon ko ek saath rakhaa gaya he
 Although it has been clarified that while Narendra Modi is the leader of the Lok Sabha, the leader of the Rajya Sabha is Arun Jaitley
 sansad main baithne kii jagah se bhi duusare number ke netaa ke bare main bhanak nahin milti
 The place with Prime Minister Modi is vacant in the Lok Sabha and is followed by Rajnath Singh
 lekin jab jetali bajet bhaashan padhane aae tab unhen modi ke saath jagah di gai or rajnath unke bagal main baithe, jabaki rajyasabha main jetali pehle baithte hai or modi unke baad
 According to analysts, the place used to be vacant in the Lok Sabha with former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 jabaki pivi narsinghraav ke bagal main arjuna singh, atal bihari vaajapeyi ke bagal main laalkrishna adwani or manmohan singh ke saath pranab mukherjee loksabhaa main baithte the
 Rajnath Singh's name comes after Modi in the Union Cabinet list
 unke baad sushamaa swaraj or phir arun jetali kaa naam he
 Rajnath Singh also sat with Modi in the first meeting of the Union Cabinet
 pradhanmantri ke baad koun? yah suspence upie sarkaar main bhi lambey vakt tak bana rahaa tha
 The reply was received in January 2009, when Manmohan Singh's bypass was cleared and then Pranab Mukherjee was asked to preside over the Union Cabinet meeting
 lekin kuch hi samay baad 26 janvari ko rakshaamantri eke antni ko ganatantr diwas samaaroh kii aguwai karne kaa mauka diya gaya
 That is, confusion about the number two leader in the cabinet is not new
 shaayad pradhanmantriyon ko bhi ye janchataa he ki is bare main tasviir dhundhlee hi bani rahe
 When India's domestic cricket is trying to bring change, the great batsman Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday suggested that each match of Ranji Trophy should be played on two different pitches, so that a better Test team can be prepared for foreign tours
 Could

 Tendulkar's suggestion of two pitches in the same Ranji match, however, was more exciting
 sachin tendulkar ne ‘hindustan times leadership summit’ ke dauraan kaha, ‘‘maine ranjai trophy main tatasth sthanon (is satr main jis par pareekshan ho rahaa he) ke bare main kaaphi soch vichaar kiya
 i have a suggestion

 ’’ Tendulkar said, "there should be a second pitch along with this ghastly pitch which is completely spin-friendly

 We focus a lot on playing fast bowling in foreign conditions but we should not forget how to play spin bowling
 ’’ He said, "don't forget that foreign teams are also losing to us in India
 shaayad ve apane gharelu maichon main esji gendon kaa istemaal shuru kar den
 Tendulkar said that by playing two innings on two pitches, the curators will not be able to create a team friendly pitch and the role of the toss will also be limited
 unhone kaha, ‘‘captain sochane lagegaa ki toss jitkar use pehle batting chunane ke adhikaar se sirf 10 pratishat hi phayda milegaa lekin agar vah ghasiyaali pich par pehle gendbaaji chunata he to use yaad rakhana chahie ki use chauthi pari main spin kii anukool pich par khelnaa hoga
 When Tendulkar was suggesting this, BCCI President Anurag Thakur was also present among the audience

 He said, "the captain will think that by winning the toss, he will get only 10 percent of the right to choose the first batting but if he chooses to bowl first on the Ghasiyali pitch, then he should remember that he should play on a spin-friendly pitch in the fourth innings

 surveykshan kitna hi khaas kyon na ho, vakt ke saath behad saamaanya ho jaataa he, usamen chaunkaane chaale tatv kam ho jate hai, balki vah gap-shap kaa acha masala banakar rah jaataa he
 The India Today sex survey has also been going on for 15 years and has become a part of stories in the media
 varshon ke surveykshanon kii baarikiyon kii yaad maamuli hi rah jaati he or amuman use samaaj vigyaan kii kisi paheli kii tarah ek saath jodakar dekhen to ye alag-alag jugnuon sareekhe chamakate dikhte hai lekin unamem badlaav kaa koi rujhaan talashne kii koshish main niraashaa hi haath lagati he
 In fact, in the middle of the survey, he finds an Indian man standing, who does not appear to be loose in any way
 badalati phijaaon se ekadam beparwaah purush pradhan samaaj kaa vah pratik khap panchayat vaali maansikta ke saath sex surveykshan ke nateezon ko abujh vigyaan kii tarah bemaani bana rahaa he
 The hustle and bustle of change is seen only indirectly, where women are seen exploring the possibility of another world
 kai saal main purushon main aae badlaavon ke aankadon par gaur karne par uske bare main ek khaas baat lagbhag aparivartaneey jaisi lagati he
 As far as sex is concerned, he seems satisfied, he has no dilemma about his goal and choice
 surveykshan ke mutabik, 18-55 varsh aayu varg ke 55 pratishat purush sex ko lekar khush dikhte hai
 For them, sex is what they want
 vah aisa rosemara kaa karmkand he jo bina condom ke puraa kiya jaataa he, kyonki condom se use anand kii anubhuti utani nahin hoti
 Men have clear aspirations for purity, especially virginity
 56 pratishat purushon kii raay spasht he ki ve us ladki yaa aurat se shaadi nahin karenge jisane vivaah purv sex kiya ho
 At least 76 percent of men have a clear opinion that marriage gives the right to have sex
 mahila lagbhag uski sampatti ban jaati he or jabaran sex saamaanya baat ho jaati he
 For a well-known Indian man, sex is a matter of solitary, later he is unable to decide whether he was merely a pump or not
 anachaahe garbh kaa sawaal use shaayad hi pareshaan karata he
 In the recent times, he has become somewhat cautious
 vyaktitv bachaae rakhane ke liye surakshit sex chahta he
 The man loves pornography, he sees it as a knowledge enhancing pleasure and tries to practice scenes like those seen in some porn movies
 mouj-maje ko praathamikta dene kii vajah se kabhi-kabhaar vah raat bhar kaa aayojan karata he or 37 pratishat kisi na kisi tarah ke samalangik sex kaa bhi anubhav lene kii baat karte hai
 Opening new opportunities for experiences gives men new workplaces
 16 pratishat ne mana ki unhone naukari main pramotion ke badale yon sambandh banane kii maang kii he
 The social picture that emerges from this is not worth discussing
 purush badlaav ke katai paksh main nahin hote, jabaki auraten badlaav ke har jharokhe se jhaankna chaahati hai
 Freedom, intimacy and respect are in the palm of every opportunity to be achieved
 unke liye mahaj ek din ke liye bhi mouj-masti or antarangta kii ahmiyat hoti he, isliye aisi sthiti main pyaar khaas myne nahin rakhata
 In fact, 33 percent of women attach more importance to safety than pleasure and fun, and financial security over sex and intimate relationships
 ek myne main yah ajeeb virodhabhas lagata he ki naitiktavaadi, paakhandee purush aazaadee kii chahat vaali mahilaon ko kam naitikta vaali bana detaa he
 Chances of changing the situation are unlikely, as parents dislike sex education in the same way as male condoms
 chote shaharon or kasbon main aazaadee or badlaav kii sambhaavna utsukata paidaa karti he, lekin desh ke kasbon main jab tak parivartan kii bayaar khulkar nahin bahane lagati tab tak intjaar karnaa chahie
 The survey suggests that sex is more of a relationship, no companionship but rather a somatic act of arousal that surrounds a puritan view of women's behavior
 mahila bhale duusari sambhaavna ke bare main soche magar purush, khaskar paariwarik vaivaahik bandhanon ke baad mahila ko sirf apni sex sambandhi jaruraton ko puraa karne vaali daasi kii tarah dekhtaa he
 Recent changes in body perception, indirect changes in small towns and cities, availability of condoms, etc
 have not made any difference in male mentality or time perception
 purush kii ankhon main aisa bhav hota he maano garbh ke thaharne main uski koi bhoomika nahin he
 The sex and information revolution does not matter much in defying this stable mindset of man
 aisi thass prishthbhumi main koi 2017 ke surveykshan ko badlaav kii afvaah sunakar khangalata he
 In the technical sense, the consumption of condoms or birth control pills every morning is still uncommon
 kabhi-kabhaar sex ke maukey talashne main halki badhotaree dikh rahi he
 Twitter and the camera are filling in a pleasant feeling as at least 10 percent of the people share videos and photos in semi-dull state
 condom kuch jhanjhat lagata he par video se vaasana or uttejnaa yaa kam se kam vaise gapshap badhati he
 a new world is slowly taking shape on social media thanks to video swaps and pornography
 nae prayogon ke liye log khul rahe hai kyonki internet sex or phone sex 20 pratishat ko aanandit kar rahaa he
 The expectation of a happy sex life in towns is high
 kareeb 80 se 90 pratishat ke bich logon kii yahi aakanksha he
 Still, when asked which part of Sangini's body arouses "excitement" in you, the answers of the people seem like a list of grocery stores
 70 pratishat logon kii jarurat abhi comarya he or vishmalingi sex hi maanak he
 It can be expected from this that only the remaining 30 percent of the people who hold a different view can do something different and create a new sense of freedom
 yah bhi ummid kii ja sakati he ki sex ko lekar shuddhtavaadi ravaiya dhilaa padane se vivaah se itar bhi duniya kii sambhaavna banane lagi he
 Marriage is a duty, but sex gives some pleasant feeling, as revealed in the survey about a one-night affair and opinions about pre-marital sex
 sex ab ek aadat, ek adhikaar kaa daawa zyada dikhne lagata he, banisbat mouj-masti yaa vaasana kii talash ke
 In this way Indian remains a figure of untouched stability from the winds of change
 (shiv vishvanathan jane-maane samaaj vigyaani hai) Uber Air and several other foreign companies are preparing to launch flying taxis
 lekin is bich bharat ke kuch honhaar yuva research swadeshi flying taxi shuru karne ke project par kaam karne ja rahe hai
 The flying taxi will be fully made in India and is targeted to be ready by 2023
 gauratlab he ki sadakon par baari trephic or jam rahane kii vajah se ab viksit deshon main parivahan ke vaikalpik saadhan taiyaar karne par jorshor se kaam ho rahaa he
 Now India too has joined this race
 google, airbas, ubar, volvo jaisi diggaj companiyaan driverles car viksit karne par kaam kar rahi hai
 Companies such as uberair, Elon Musk's Boring Company and Hyperloop One are working on developing airtaxi or underground transport systems
 ham bharatiyon ke liye khushkhabari ai haiiiti kanpurase, jisane isi maheene ek nijee company vitioel aviation india ke saath ek qaraar kiya he
 Under this agreement of Rs 15 crore, more than 100 research students of iits will develop a prototype air taxi, which can be used for commercial flying taxis
 yah project 2023 tak puraa hoga
 In India, this technology is still in infancy, but if our young researchers succeed, it can get rid of the growing traffic problem in metros like Delhi, Mumbai
 paanch saal main puraa hoga projectakaraar ke tahat iaiti ke researchrs ko yah project agle paanch saal main puraa karnaa hoga
 "we will work on the concept and identify key technology areas," said Ajoy Ghosh, head of aerospace engineering and flight lab at IIT Kanpur
 agle varshon main is par 100 se zyada student kaam karenge
 Emphasis on 'make in India': To further accelerate PM Modi's Make in India campaign, VTOL Aviation India has started a project named 'VTOL Air Taxi Campaign'
 iske tahat company atyaadhunik vitioel aircraft banaaegi jiske dwaara kifayati or teevr yatayaat sevaayen di ja sakengi
 VTOL stands for vertical take-off and landing
 is takanic kaa istemaal kisi vimaan ko sidhe jameen par utaarne or jameen se upar udaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The proposed 'flying Taxi' will operate with electric power, so it will use completely clean energy
 haalanki is tarah kii taxi kii seva shuru karne ke liesarkaar or niamkonki manjuuri kii jarurat hogi

 My commitment to the game & 20yrs of playing for my country
 The hard work, sweat, in vain
 Today, my patriotism doubted, my skill set questioned & all the mud slinging- it's the darkest day of my life
 May god give strength mitali raaj or phir ramesh powar kii report ke baad board ne abhi bhi maamle par chuppi sadhi hui he, lekin ek baat saaf he ki yah mudda abhi yaheen hi khatm hone nahin ja rahaa he

 And what does BCCI break out of it
 mujffarnagar dange ke baad musalamaanon kii naaraazgi dur karne main lage samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav kii mushkilen kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan, advisor to the handloom and textile industry, has given a big blow to Mulayam by resigning
 isaki vajah unhone sapa sarkaar kaa thik se kaam na kar paanaa bataai he
 According to Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan, the issues of Muslims in the SP government are not being resolved
 mujffarnagar dangon se beghar hue tamaam musalmaan apane gaanvon ko lautnaa chaahate hai, magar sarkaar unhen paryaapt suraksha muhaiyaa nahin kara paa rahi he
 This work can be done easily by setting up a police post in those villages, but the government is not interested in it
 jo musalmaan apane gharon ko nahin lautnaa chaahate, unke liye colony banaakar dene kii maang unhone sarkaar ke saamne rakhi thi, lekin is par bhi vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 Maulana alleges that his demand for the formation of a riot commission, withdrawal of cases filed against innocent Muslims and Urdu leaflets in PCS (J) were also unheard
 moulana tawqir ne bataaya ki inhen sab masalon ke hal na hone se unhone istipha diya he
 He will be in a position to work with the SP government only when these issues are resolved
 moulana tawqir ittehad e millat concil (iemasi) ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Maulana says that if this is the attitude of the government, then his party will be forced to reconsider the agreement with the SP
 sarkaar se istipha dene vaale barelvi masalak ke ve duusare netaa hai
 Earlier, Vice Chairman of State Integration Council Abid Khan has also sent his resignation to the Chief Minister
 tata motors ke vaahanon kii kul bikri november maheene main giri1 janvari se badhengi tata motors ke car kii keemtenmaruti sujuki ke baad tata motors ne car kii keemten badha di hai
 Mayank Pareek, an officer of Tata Motors, has informed this
 unhone news agency pitiai ko bataaya, ‘‘bharat stage-chah utsarjan maanakon ke anukool vaahanon ko bazaar main laane ke kaaran janvari se keemten badhaai jaaengi
 However, he did not say how much the price would be increased
 pari ne kaha, ‘‘ham abhi isaki gananaa kar rahe hai
 Usually, if there is a change, the prices increase by 10 to 15 thousand rupees
 abhi do chijen ho rahi hai, ek to bharat stage-chah or doosraa camodity kii badhati keemton kaa dabaav
 "tata Motors 'total vehicle sales decline
 Tata Motors' total vehicle sales 25 in November

 The company said in a statement that it had sold 55,074 units in November last year
 is dauraan, tata motors kii gharelu bikri pichley saal kii 50,470 ikaayiyon kii tulana main 25 pratishat girakar 38,057 ikaayiyon par aa gai

 Maruti has also announced that Maruti Suzuki India had also said on Tuesday that it will increase prices from January due to increased costs
 toyota, mahindra and mahindra or marcides-banj jaisi companiyaan bhi vaahanon ke daam badhaane vaali hai
 However, Hyundai Motor India and Honda Cars India have said they have not been raising prices since January, but prices will go up when India Stage-six friendly vehicles are introduced in the market
 whatsap par afvaah failaane vaale girohon ke liye masala acha he jis par ham charchaa karne ja rahe hai
 This is a great spice for political parties
 pradhanmantri to hameshaa aabaadi ko sambhaavna maanate hai
 Speak openly in rallies as well
 isi aabaadi main yuvaaon kaa pratishat badha he to ve bharat ke liye sambhaavnaaen dekh pate hai
 But some organizations and parties also look at this question with a look of apprehension
 ve dekhte rahete hai ki kis kis kaa bad rahaa he
 We increased but not those
 25 agast ko bharat sarkaar ke register general ne dharmik samoohon kaa aankada jari kiya
 We want to show you how he was reporting
 pehle hindi akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan hedline dekhte hai
 - Political data of religion, census data before election, Muslim population increased fastest (navbharat Times) - hindu ghat gaye, musalamaanon kii aabaadi main badhotaree (jansatta) - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi, hinduon kii 0
 7% decrease (dainik Bhaskar) - sikh, buddha bhi ghate, isai or jain beasar - Muslim growth is more than average growth rate - bihar chunaav main bada mudda banenge aankade Dainik Bhaskar also told in a small box that if the Hindu Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, it would take 270 to equalize, which means that by 2285, India will have a population of 13,000 crores
 isi tarah scrol news site ne bhi likhaa he ki 100 saal se daraaya ja rahaa he ki ek din musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 For this to happen, if the Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, then in 200 years, Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 tab bharat kii aabaadi 3,264 karod hogi
 The calculator of Dainik Bhaskar and scroll seems to be different
 13000 karod se lekar 3,264 karod bharat kii aabaadi
 i do not think even then the Muslims will be very happy that now we will be so much now we have no problem
 aap kalpana kiijie to dar lagegaa
 For Hindus as well as for Muslims
 aadmi ke upar aadmi chalaa karegaa
 Anyway kuch or akhbaar dekhte hai
 - Increased Muslim share (dainik Jagran) - aabaadi kii raftaar : hinduon kii dhimi, muslimon kii tej (amar ujaalaa) - It was the first time that the population of Hindus came down below 80% - varsh 2050 tak 180 karod hindu or 41 karod muslim honge According to Amar Ujala, for the next 35 years, even half of the Hindus will not be able to reach
 so afvaah failaane vaale giroh relax karen
 Hindustan newspaper headlines are - muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi 0 - The share of Hindus in the population
 7% ghati - In all Hindi newspapers, it was emphasized that the population of Muslims is increasing rapidly
 jabaki hindu akhbaar ke mutabik sachai ye he ki musalamaanon main aabaadi kii vikaas dar baakiyon ke mukaable sabase tej giri he
 In The Wire, Chitra Padmanabhan has written that census figures should not be read like the Sensex
 jaise musalmaan ap hindu down
 The pace of growth of Muslim population between 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 29
 5 se ghatakar 24
 Has arrived at 6
 shaabaashi hinduon ko bhi milani chahie
 The growth rate of their population 19
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 16
 8 percent
 kya media kaa bada hissaa musalamaanon ke bare main ek hi tarah se sochataa he
 There are more figures in the press releases of the Government of India but they probably do not attract attention
 ek akhbaar ne likhaa bhi ki beti bachaane main hinduon se aage hai musalmaan
 - Between 2001-2011, the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 for one thousand men
 - isi dauraan hinduon main ling anupaat prati hazaar purushon par 939 par pahunchaa he
 - Though Hindus have improved, the national average is one less than 940
 - musalamaanon main ling anupaat rashtriya ausat se 11 zyaada he
 It is not a matter of all of us to be able to look at the data closely
 isliye jaisaa bataaya jaataa he hamamen se kai log vaisaa maan lete hai jabaki vaisaa hota nahin he
 Let's look at how the English newspapers covered the issue and what their headline was
 pehle times of india phir uske baad hindustan times kii hedline dekhenge
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down vaise tivi kaa bhi zikr hona chahie tha magar channelon ke pichley dinon ke hedline milte nahin hai
 Both the big English newspapers also kept the Muslim population growing
 indian express or da hindu kii surkhiyaan alag thim pehle indian express dekhte hai
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population growth slows - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - Mail Today wrote that Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 kai akhabaaron kii surkhiyon ke bare main isliye bataaya taaki aap gaur kar saken ki hamaara media samaaj hindu muslim se judi khabaron ko kaise dekhtaa he
 On the scroll website, Jan Dayal has seen one aspect of these figures from his perspective
 - haryana main isai aabaadi main 85
 An increase of 22 percent has been reported
 - ab is aankade ko dekhte hi lagegaa haryana main jat gaye, isai aa gaye
 - According to the 2001 census Christians were 27,185
 - 2011 main 50,353 ho gai Like other communities, Christians have migrated to Haryana
 khaas baat ye he ki jab aabaadi hi kam ho to usamen hone vaali vruddhi pratishat ke taur par kaafii badi lagati he
 In Haryana itself, the population of Hindus has increased by 35 lakh 15 thousand and the population of Sikhs has increased by 73 thousand
 isliye janaganana ke aankadon ko hameshaa hindu banaam musalmaan ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie varna ham or aap nayaa kya janenge nayaa kya kahenge
 John Dayal has written that in Christian-dominated Nagaland, 2 in the population of Christians
 83% kii giravat ai he
 The Sangh books state that Nagaland is a state where the plurality of Christians is becoming a threat to India's security
 musalamaanon kii aabaadi kam hui he iske baad bhi puure desh kii aabaadi badhane kii ausat dar se kaaphi zyaada he
 Accordingly, the speed of the population of all Hindus and Muslims should be reduced
 lekin rashtriya ausat se 7 fisadi adhik raftaar kya vaaki musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke prati shaq paidaa karti he
 If she does, what are they suspicious about
 kyon hai
 This issue has always been serious for the RSS
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki dash main ek jansankhya niti honi chahie
 a two-child policy should be implemented for all and there should be improvement within Muslims
 is par vistaar se baat karenge
 The comments kyon vipakshi dalon ko lagata he ki iske zariye dharmik dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 It is related to Bihar elections
 jaise dhruvikaran ke aujaar kam pad gaye hon
 Is it because the figures have been leaked earlier also? kuch hindu agar muslaanon kii aabaadi ko kisi duusari nazar se dekhte hai to hindu apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhte hai
 Will Muslims be afraid of the large population of Hindus as some people scare Hindus when their population increases
 musalmaan apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhtaa he
 How to look
 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai
 Not from religion
 lekin badhane kaa aankada aate hi dharm kaaran ho jaataa he
 We will also talk about whether the population grows at the speed of producing children
 navjaat mrityu dar yaa lambey samay tak jivan kaa bhi koi role he
 It is a very complex subject
 pichhali baar prime time kiya tha to meri ek baat ko lekar whatsap main abhi tak afvaah failaai gayi
 Beware of such gangs
 magar kuch sanghathan or dal is sawaal ko ashanka kii nazar se bhi dekhte hai
 They keep watching who is growing
 ham logon kaa bade magar un logon kaa nahin bade
 On 25 August the Registrar General of the Government of India released the data of religious groups
 uski kis tarah se reporting hui ye ham aapako dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 First Hindi newspaper headlines see the headline
 - dharm kaa siyaasi data, chunaav se pehle janaganana ke aankade, muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi (navabharat times) - Hindus decreased, Muslims increased (population) - aabaadi main muslamon kii hissedari 0
 Hindus increased by 8%, 0
 7% ghati (dainik bhaskar) - Sikhs, Buddhists also decreased, Christians and Jains were ineffective - ausat vruddhi dar se zyaada he muslimon kii badhat - Statistics will become a big issue in Bihar elections dainik bhaskar ne ek chote se box main yah bhi bataaya ki agar hindu musalmaan kii aabaadi maujuuda dar se badhati rahi to donon ko barabaar hone main 270 lag jaayenge yani 2285 main aisa hote hote bharat kii aabaadi 13,000 karod ho jaaegi
 Similarly, the scroll news site has also written that for 100 years it is being intimidated that one day Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 aisa hone ke liye maujuuda dar se musalmaan kii aabaadi badhati rahi to 200 saal main musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 Then India's population will be 3,264 crore
 lagata he dainik bhaskar or scrol kaa calculator kuch alag he
 India's population from 13000 crores to 3,264 crores
 mujhe nahin lagata ki tab musalmaan bhi bahut khush honge ki dekhon ab ham itane honge nau ve haev no problem
 If you imagine, you will be scared
 hindu ke liye bhi or musalmaan ke liye bhi
 Man will run over man
 khayr
 Let's see some more newspapers
 - badi muslim hissedari (dainik jaagran) - Population speed: Hindus slow, Muslims fast (amar Ujala) - aisa pehali baar hua ki hinduon kii aabaadi 80% se neeche ai - By the year 2050 there will be 180 crore Hindus and 41 crore Muslims - amar ujaalaa ke hisaab se to agle 35 saal tak musalmaan hinduon ke aadhe bhi nahin pahunch paayenge
 So relax rumor gangs
 hindustan akhbaar kii surkhiyaan hai - Muslim population grew fastest - muslimon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 Increased 8% - hinduon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 7% decrease - sabhi hindi akhabaaron main is baat par jor rahaa ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Whereas according to Hindu newspaper, the truth is that the growth rate of population in Muslims has fallen faster than the rest
 di vir main chitra padmanabhan ne likhaa he ki sensos ke aankadon ko sensex kii tarah nahin padhaa janaa chahie
 Like Muslim up Hindu down
 1991-2001 or 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar 29
 24 down from 5
 6 par ai he
 Well done Hindus should also get it
 unki aabaadi kii badhane kii raftaar 19
 16 minus 9 percent
 8 pratishat hui he
 Does the bulk of the media think about Muslims in the same way

 Therefore, it is said that many of us accept it when it is not
 angrezi akhbaaron ne is masale ko kaise cover kiya or unki kya hedline thi is par nazar daalate hai
 First the Times of India will then see the headline of Hindustan Times
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all Communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down Although TV should also have been mentioned, but the headlines of the previous days of the channels are not available
 angrezi ke donon bade akhabaaron ne bhi muslim aabaadi badhane ko aage rakhaa
 The headlines of The Indian Express and The Hindu were different, see the Indian Express earlier
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population slows growth - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - mail today ne likhaa ki Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 Told many newspaper headlines so that you can consider how our media society views the news related to Hindu Muslim
 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he
 - 85 in Christian population in Haryana
 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come
 - 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik isai 27,185 the
 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new
 jaan dayaal ne likhaa he ki isai bahul nagaland main to isaayiyon kii aabaadi main 2
 Declined by 83%
 sangh kii kitaaben kahati hai ki nagaland aisa rajya he jahaan isaayiyon kii bahulata bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatara ban rahi he
 Even after the Muslim population has decreased, the population of the entire country is much higher than the average rate of increase
 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population
 agar karti he to ve shaq kya hai
 Why are aresas ke liye yah mudda hameshaa se gambhir rahaa he
 The Sangh believes that there should be a population policy in Dash
 sabhi ke liye do bachche kii niti lagu ho or musalamaanon ke bheetar sudhaar ho
 We will talk about this in detail
 tippaniyan Why do the opposition parties think that it will try to polarize the religious
 bihar chunaav se iskaa taalluk he
 As polarization tools have fallen short
 kya is vajah se ki pehle bhi ye aankade li kiye ja chuke hai
 If some Hindus look at the population of Muslims from another point of view, then how do Hindus see the question of population within themselves
 musalmaan hinduon kii adhik aabaadi ke bare main kya vaise hi darataa hoga jaise uski aabaadi badhane par kuch log hinduon ko daraate hai
 How does a Muslim see the question of population within himself
 kaise dekhnaa chahie
 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he
 But as soon as the figure of increase comes, religion becomes the reason
 is par bhi baat karenge ki kya aabaadi bachche paidaa karne kii raftaar se hi badhati he
 There is also a role of neonatal mortality or prolonged life
 bahut jatil vishay he
 Last time i did prime time, so far rumors were spread in whatsapp regarding one of my things
 aise girohon se saavdhaan rahiye
 - Political data of religion, census data before election, Muslim population increased fastest (navbharat Times) - hindu ghat gaye, musalamaanon kii aabaadi main badhotaree (jansatta) - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi, hinduon kii 0
 7% decrease (dainik Bhaskar) - sikh, buddha bhi ghate, isai or jain beasar - Muslim growth is more than average growth rate - bihar chunaav main bada mudda banenge aankade Dainik Bhaskar also told in a small box that if the Hindu Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, it would take 270 to equalize, which means that by 2285, India will have a population of 13,000 crores
 isi tarah scrol news site ne bhi likhaa he ki 100 saal se daraaya ja rahaa he ki ek din musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 For this to happen, if the Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, then in 200 years, Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 tab bharat kii aabaadi 3,264 karod hogi
 The calculator of Dainik Bhaskar and scroll seems to be different
 13000 karod se lekar 3,264 karod bharat kii aabaadi
 i do not think even then the Muslims will be very happy that now we will be so much now we have no problem
 aap kalpana kiijie to dar lagegaa
 For Hindus as well as for Muslims
 aadmi ke upar aadmi chalaa karegaa
 Anyway kuch or akhbaar dekhte hai
 - Increased Muslim share (dainik Jagran) - aabaadi kii raftaar : hinduon kii dhimi, muslimon kii tej (amar ujaalaa) - It was the first time that the population of Hindus came down below 80% - varsh 2050 tak 180 karod hindu or 41 karod muslim honge According to Amar Ujala, for the next 35 years, even half of the Hindus will not be able to reach
 so afvaah failaane vaale giroh relax karen
 Hindustan newspaper headlines are - muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi 0 - The share of Hindus in the population
 7% ghati - In all Hindi newspapers, it was emphasized that the population of Muslims is increasing rapidly
 jabaki hindu akhbaar ke mutabik sachai ye he ki musalamaanon main aabaadi kii vikaas dar baakiyon ke mukaable sabase tej giri he
 In The Wire, Chitra Padmanabhan has written that census figures should not be read like the Sensex
 jaise musalmaan ap hindu down
 The pace of growth of Muslim population between 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 29
 5 se ghatakar 24
 Has arrived at 6
 shaabaashi hinduon ko bhi milani chahie
 The growth rate of their population 19
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 16
 8 percent
 kya media kaa bada hissaa musalamaanon ke bare main ek hi tarah se sochataa he
 There are more figures in the press releases of the Government of India but they probably do not attract attention
 ek akhbaar ne likhaa bhi ki beti bachaane main hinduon se aage hai musalmaan
 - Between 2001-2011, the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 for one thousand men
 - isi dauraan hinduon main ling anupaat prati hazaar purushon par 939 par pahunchaa he
 - Though Hindus have improved, the national average is one less than 940
 - musalamaanon main ling anupaat rashtriya ausat se 11 zyaada he
 It is not a matter of all of us to be able to look at the data closely
 isliye jaisaa bataaya jaataa he hamamen se kai log vaisaa maan lete hai jabaki vaisaa hota nahin he
 Let's look at how the English newspapers covered the issue and what their headline was
 pehle times of india phir uske baad hindustan times kii hedline dekhenge
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down vaise tivi kaa bhi zikr hona chahie tha magar channelon ke pichley dinon ke hedline milte nahin hai
 Both the big English newspapers also kept the Muslim population growing
 indian express or da hindu kii surkhiyaan alag thim pehle indian express dekhte hai
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population growth slows - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - Mail Today wrote that Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 kai akhabaaron kii surkhiyon ke bare main isliye bataaya taaki aap gaur kar saken ki hamaara media samaaj hindu muslim se judi khabaron ko kaise dekhtaa he
 On the scroll website, Jan Dayal has seen one aspect of these figures from his perspective
 - haryana main isai aabaadi main 85
 An increase of 22 percent has been reported
 - ab is aankade ko dekhte hi lagegaa haryana main jat gaye, isai aa gaye
 - According to the 2001 census Christians were 27,185
 - 2011 main 50,353 ho gai Like other communities, Christians have migrated to Haryana
 khaas baat ye he ki jab aabaadi hi kam ho to usamen hone vaali vruddhi pratishat ke taur par kaafii badi lagati he
 In Haryana itself, the population of Hindus has increased by 35 lakh 15 thousand and the population of Sikhs has increased by 73 thousand
 isliye janaganana ke aankadon ko hameshaa hindu banaam musalmaan ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie varna ham or aap nayaa kya janenge nayaa kya kahenge
 John Dayal has written that in Christian-dominated Nagaland, 2 in the population of Christians
 83% kii giravat ai he
 The Sangh books state that Nagaland is a state where the plurality of Christians is becoming a threat to India's security
 musalamaanon kii aabaadi kam hui he iske baad bhi puure desh kii aabaadi badhane kii ausat dar se kaaphi zyaada he
 Accordingly, the speed of the population of all Hindus and Muslims should be reduced
 lekin rashtriya ausat se 7 fisadi adhik raftaar kya vaaki musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke prati shaq paidaa karti he
 If she does, what are they suspicious about
 kyon hai
 This issue has always been serious for the RSS
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki dash main ek jansankhya niti honi chahie
 a two-child policy should be implemented for all and there should be improvement within Muslims
 is par vistaar se baat karenge
 The comments kyon vipakshi dalon ko lagata he ki iske zariye dharmik dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 It is related to Bihar elections
 jaise dhruvikaran ke aujaar kam pad gaye hon
 Is it because the figures have been leaked earlier also? kuch hindu agar muslaanon kii aabaadi ko kisi duusari nazar se dekhte hai to hindu apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhte hai
 Will Muslims be afraid of the large population of Hindus as some people scare Hindus when their population increases
 musalmaan apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhtaa he
 How to look
 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai
 Not from religion
 lekin badhane kaa aankada aate hi dharm kaaran ho jaataa he
 We will also talk about whether the population grows at the speed of producing children
 navjaat mrityu dar yaa lambey samay tak jivan kaa bhi koi role he
 It is a very complex subject
 pichhali baar prime time kiya tha to meri ek baat ko lekar whatsap main abhi tak afvaah failaai gayi
 Beware of such gangs
 dainik bhaskar ne ek chote se box main yah bhi bataaya ki agar hindu musalmaan kii aabaadi maujuuda dar se badhati rahi to donon ko barabaar hone main 270 lag jaayenge yani 2285 main aisa hote hote bharat kii aabaadi 13,000 karod ho jaaegi
 Similarly, the scroll news site has also written that for 100 years it is being intimidated that one day Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 aisa hone ke liye maujuuda dar se musalmaan kii aabaadi badhati rahi to 200 saal main musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 Then India's population will be 3,264 crore
 lagata he dainik bhaskar or scrol kaa calculator kuch alag he
 India's population from 13000 crores to 3,264 crores
 mujhe nahin lagata ki tab musalmaan bhi bahut khush honge ki dekhon ab ham itane honge nau ve haev no problem
 If you imagine, you will be scared
 hindu ke liye bhi or musalmaan ke liye bhi
 Man will run over man
 khayr
 Let's see some more newspapers
 - badi muslim hissedari (dainik jaagran) - Population speed: Hindus slow, Muslims fast (amar Ujala) - aisa pehali baar hua ki hinduon kii aabaadi 80% se neeche ai - By the year 2050 there will be 180 crore Hindus and 41 crore Muslims - amar ujaalaa ke hisaab se to agle 35 saal tak musalmaan hinduon ke aadhe bhi nahin pahunch paayenge
 So relax rumor gangs
 hindustan akhbaar kii surkhiyaan hai - Muslim population grew fastest - muslimon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 Increased 8% - hinduon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 7% decrease - sabhi hindi akhabaaron main is baat par jor rahaa ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Whereas according to Hindu newspaper, the truth is that the growth rate of population in Muslims has fallen faster than the rest
 di vir main chitra padmanabhan ne likhaa he ki sensos ke aankadon ko sensex kii tarah nahin padhaa janaa chahie
 Like Muslim up Hindu down
 1991-2001 or 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar 29
 24 down from 5
 6 par ai he
 Well done Hindus should also get it
 unki aabaadi kii badhane kii raftaar 19
 16 minus 9 percent
 8 pratishat hui he
 Does the bulk of the media think about Muslims in the same way
 bharat sarkaar kii press relise main or bhi aankaden hai lekin ve shaayad dhyaan aakarshith nahin karte hai
 a newspaper also wrote that Muslims are ahead of Hindus in saving daughters

 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population

 sabhi ke liye do bachche kii niti lagu ho or musalamaanon ke bheetar sudhaar ho
 We will talk about this in detail

 If some Hindus look at the population of Muslims from another point of view, then how do Hindus see the question of population within themselves
 musalmaan hinduon kii adhik aabaadi ke bare main kya vaise hi darataa hoga jaise uski aabaadi badhane par kuch log hinduon ko daraate hai
 How does a Muslim see the question of population within himself
 kaise dekhnaa chahie
 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he
 But as soon as the figure of increase comes, religion becomes the reason
 is par bhi baat karenge ki kya aabaadi bachche paidaa karne kii raftaar se hi badhati he
 There is also a role of neonatal mortality or prolonged life
 bahut jatil vishay he
 Last time i did prime time, so far rumors were spread in whatsapp regarding one of my things
 aise girohon se saavdhaan rahiye
 According to Amar Ujala, for the next 35 years, even half of the Hindus will not be able to reach
 so afvaah failaane vaale giroh relax karen
 Hindustan newspaper headlines are - muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi 0 - The share of Hindus in the population
 7% ghati - In all Hindi newspapers, it was emphasized that the population of Muslims is increasing rapidly
 jabaki hindu akhbaar ke mutabik sachai ye he ki musalamaanon main aabaadi kii vikaas dar baakiyon ke mukaable sabase tej giri he
 In The Wire, Chitra Padmanabhan has written that census figures should not be read like the Sensex
 jaise musalmaan ap hindu down
 The pace of growth of Muslim population between 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 29
 5 se ghatakar 24

 shaabaashi hinduon ko bhi milani chahie
 The growth rate of their population 19
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 16
 8 percent
 kya media kaa bada hissaa musalamaanon ke bare main ek hi tarah se sochataa he
 There are more figures in the press releases of the Government of India but they probably do not attract attention
 ek akhbaar ne likhaa bhi ki beti bachaane main hinduon se aage hai musalmaan
 - Between 2001-2011, the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 for one thousand men
 - isi dauraan hinduon main ling anupaat prati hazaar purushon par 939 par pahunchaa he
 - Though Hindus have improved, the national average is one less than 940
 - musalamaanon main ling anupaat rashtriya ausat se 11 zyaada he
 It is not a matter of all of us to be able to look at the data closely
 isliye jaisaa bataaya jaataa he hamamen se kai log vaisaa maan lete hai jabaki vaisaa hota nahin he
 Let's look at how the English newspapers covered the issue and what their headline was

 Both the big English newspapers also kept the Muslim population growing
 indian express or da hindu kii surkhiyaan alag thim pehle indian express dekhte hai
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population growth slows - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - Mail Today wrote that Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 kai akhabaaron kii surkhiyon ke bare main isliye bataaya taaki aap gaur kar saken ki hamaara media samaaj hindu muslim se judi khabaron ko kaise dekhtaa he
 On the scroll website, Jan Dayal has seen one aspect of these figures from his perspective
 - haryana main isai aabaadi main 85
 An increase of 22 percent has been reported
 - ab is aankade ko dekhte hi lagegaa haryana main jat gaye, isai aa gaye
 - According to the 2001 census Christians were 27,185
 - 2011 main 50,353 ho gai Like other communities, Christians have migrated to Haryana
 khaas baat ye he ki jab aabaadi hi kam ho to usamen hone vaali vruddhi pratishat ke taur par kaafii badi lagati he
 In Haryana itself, the population of Hindus has increased by 35 lakh 15 thousand and the population of Sikhs has increased by 73 thousand
 isliye janaganana ke aankadon ko hameshaa hindu banaam musalmaan ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie varna ham or aap nayaa kya janenge nayaa kya kahenge
 John Dayal has written that in Christian-dominated Nagaland, 2 in the population of Christians

 The Sangh books state that Nagaland is a state where the plurality of Christians is becoming a threat to India's security
 musalamaanon kii aabaadi kam hui he iske baad bhi puure desh kii aabaadi badhane kii ausat dar se kaaphi zyaada he
 Accordingly, the speed of the population of all Hindus and Muslims should be reduced
 lekin rashtriya ausat se 7 fisadi adhik raftaar kya vaaki musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke prati shaq paidaa karti he
 If she does, what are they suspicious about
 kyon hai
 This issue has always been serious for the RSS
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki dash main ek jansankhya niti honi chahie

 The comments kyon vipakshi dalon ko lagata he ki iske zariye dharmik dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 It is related to Bihar elections
 jaise dhruvikaran ke aujaar kam pad gaye hon
 Is it because the figures have been leaked earlier also? kuch hindu agar muslaanon kii aabaadi ko kisi duusari nazar se dekhte hai to hindu apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhte hai
 Will Muslims be afraid of the large population of Hindus as some people scare Hindus when their population increases
 musalmaan apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhtaa he
 How to look
 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai
 Not from religion
 lekin badhane kaa aankada aate hi dharm kaaran ho jaataa he
 We will also talk about whether the population grows at the speed of producing children
 navjaat mrityu dar yaa lambey samay tak jivan kaa bhi koi role he
 It is a very complex subject
 pichhali baar prime time kiya tha to meri ek baat ko lekar whatsap main abhi tak afvaah failaai gayi
 Beware of such gangs
 - sabhi hindi akhabaaron main is baat par jor rahaa ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Whereas according to Hindu newspaper, the truth is that the growth rate of population in Muslims has fallen faster than the rest
 di vir main chitra padmanabhan ne likhaa he ki sensos ke aankadon ko sensex kii tarah nahin padhaa janaa chahie
 Like Muslim up Hindu down
 1991-2001 or 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar 29
 24 down from 5
 6 par ai he
 Well done Hindus should also get it
 unki aabaadi kii badhane kii raftaar 19
 16 minus 9 percent
 8 pratishat hui he
 Does the bulk of the media think about Muslims in the same way
 bharat sarkaar kii press relise main or bhi aankaden hai lekin ve shaayad dhyaan aakarshith nahin karte hai
 a newspaper also wrote that Muslims are ahead of Hindus in saving daughters
 - 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon main ling anupaat ek hazaar purushon par 951 he
 At the same time, the sex ratio among Hindus has reached 939 per thousand males
 - haalanki hinduon main sudhaar hua he magar rashtriya ausat 940 se ek kam he
 - Sex ratio among Muslims is 11 more than the national average
 ham sabhi ke bas kii baat nahin he ki aankadon ko baarik nigaah se dekh saken
 Therefore, it is said that many of us accept it when it is not
 angrezi akhbaaron ne is masale ko kaise cover kiya or unki kya hedline thi is par nazar daalate hai

 The headlines of The Indian Express and The Hindu were different, see the Indian Express earlier
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population slows growth - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - mail today ne likhaa ki Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 Told many newspaper headlines so that you can consider how our media society views the news related to Hindu Muslim
 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he

 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come

 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new

 The comments kyon vipakshi dalon ko lagata he ki iske zariye dharmik dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 It is related to Bihar elections
 jaise dhruvikaran ke aujaar kam pad gaye hon
 Is it because the figures have been leaked earlier also? kuch hindu agar muslaanon kii aabaadi ko kisi duusari nazar se dekhte hai to hindu apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhte hai
 Will Muslims be afraid of the large population of Hindus as some people scare Hindus when their population increases
 musalmaan apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhtaa he
 How to look
 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai
 Not from religion
 lekin badhane kaa aankada aate hi dharm kaaran ho jaataa he
 We will also talk about whether the population grows at the speed of producing children
 navjaat mrityu dar yaa lambey samay tak jivan kaa bhi koi role he
 It is a very complex subject
 pichhali baar prime time kiya tha to meri ek baat ko lekar whatsap main abhi tak afvaah failaai gayi
 Beware of such gangs
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all Communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down Although TV should also have been mentioned, but the headlines of the previous days of the channels are not available
 angrezi ke donon bade akhabaaron ne bhi muslim aabaadi badhane ko aage rakhaa
 The headlines of The Indian Express and The Hindu were different, see the Indian Express earlier
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population slows growth - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - mail today ne likhaa ki Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 Told many newspaper headlines so that you can consider how our media society views the news related to Hindu Muslim
 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he
 - 85 in Christian population in Haryana
 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come
 - 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik isai 27,185 the
 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new
 jaan dayaal ne likhaa he ki isai bahul nagaland main to isaayiyon kii aabaadi main 2
 Declined by 83%
 sangh kii kitaaben kahati hai ki nagaland aisa rajya he jahaan isaayiyon kii bahulata bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatara ban rahi he
 Even after the Muslim population has decreased, the population of the entire country is much higher than the average rate of increase
 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population
 agar karti he to ve shaq kya hai
 Why are aresas ke liye yah mudda hameshaa se gambhir rahaa he

 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he

 kai akhabaaron kii surkhiyon ke bare main isliye bataaya taaki aap gaur kar saken ki hamaara media samaaj hindu muslim se judi khabaron ko kaise dekhtaa he
 On the scroll website, Jan Dayal has seen one aspect of these figures from his perspective
 - haryana main isai aabaadi main 85
 An increase of 22 percent has been reported
 - ab is aankade ko dekhte hi lagegaa haryana main jat gaye, isai aa gaye
 - According to the 2001 census Christians were 27,185
 - 2011 main 50,353 ho gai Like other communities, Christians have migrated to Haryana
 khaas baat ye he ki jab aabaadi hi kam ho to usamen hone vaali vruddhi pratishat ke taur par kaafii badi lagati he
 In Haryana itself, the population of Hindus has increased by 35 lakh 15 thousand and the population of Sikhs has increased by 73 thousand
 isliye janaganana ke aankadon ko hameshaa hindu banaam musalmaan ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie varna ham or aap nayaa kya janenge nayaa kya kahenge
 John Dayal has written that in Christian-dominated Nagaland, 2 in the population of Christians
 83% kii giravat ai he
 The Sangh books state that Nagaland is a state where the plurality of Christians is becoming a threat to India's security
 musalamaanon kii aabaadi kam hui he iske baad bhi puure desh kii aabaadi badhane kii ausat dar se kaaphi zyaada he
 Accordingly, the speed of the population of all Hindus and Muslims should be reduced
 lekin rashtriya ausat se 7 fisadi adhik raftaar kya vaaki musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke prati shaq paidaa karti he
 If she does, what are they suspicious about
 kyon hai
 This issue has always been serious for the RSS

 The Supreme Court has allowed the Karnataka High Court to pronounce judgment on the appeal against Jayalalithaa's sentence
 karnataka hai court ne supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik, is maamle par faisla surakshit rakhaa tha, kyonki diemke kii taraf se supreme court main ek apil daayar kar sarkari vakil bhavani singh kii niyukti par sawaal uthaaye the
 The matter was going on in the Karnataka High Court, but Bhavani Singh was appointed by the Tamil Nadu government, to which the DMK objected
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki bhavani singh kii niyukti kaanoon kii maryaadaaon ke khilaaf he or sahi nahin he, lekin saath hi saath yah bhi kaha ki is vajah se dobaaraa is maamle main sunwaayee kii zarurat nahi he
 That is, before May 12, the Karnataka High Court will give its verdict in this case, because Jayalalithaa's bail will end on this day
 takreeban 67 karod rupee ke aay se adhik sampatti ke 1996 ke is maamle main pichley saal bengalooru kii ek vishesh trial court ne jayalalita ko 4 saal kii jail or 100 karod rupee ke jurmaane kii sajaa di thi

 maamla karnataka hoicourt main chal rahaa tha, lekin bhavani singh kii niyukti tamilnadu sarkaar kii taraf se kii gai thi, jis par diemke ne aitaraaz jataayaa tha
 The Supreme Court, in its order, said that Bhawani Singh's appointment is against the limits of law and is not correct, but at the same time said that due to this, there is no need to hear again in this case
 yani ab 12 may se pehle karnataka hoicourt is maamle main apana faisla sunayega, kyonki jayalalita kii jamaanat is din khatm ho jaaegi
 Jayalalithaa was sentenced to 4 years in jail and a fine of Rs 100 crore by a special trial court in Bengaluru in the 1996 case of disproportionate assets worth about Rs 67 crore
 tippaniyan Jayalalithaa had appealed in the Karnataka High Court against this decision
 supreme court ne teen maheene ke andar sunwaayee puri karne kaa aadesh hoicourt ko diya tha

 bengalooru kii vishesh trial court ne jayalalita ke saath-saath unki sahyogi en shashikala je elvarsi or dattak putr ve en sudhakaran ko bhi chaar-chaar saal kii sazaa or 10-10 lakh rupee ke jurmaane kii sajaa sunai thi

 It must have happened to you in your childhood that you would have kept a ball pen inside your pocket and later you would have noticed that the ink of the pen flowed into your pocket
 ham sabake saath aisa kai baar hua he, lekin hamen isaki vajah nahin maaloom hoti hai
 Know why this happens
 
 
 aisa kalam ke sharir se chipke hone ke kaaran hota he
 Due to the heat of the body, the ink of the pen becomes hot and it becomes liquid and comes out from the point of the peck
 vahiin, tub ke duusare chor par ek chote sa tel plag bhi hota he, vah bhi garam hokartaralahone lagata he
 The adhesive force (adhesive force) that keeps the liquid ink sticking to its wall also starts to decrease
 yahi vajah he ki syaahi baahar aane lagati he
 Apart from this, capillary action also comes into effect
 darasalkeshika kriyaayek aisi cheez he jo kisi taral padaarth ko gurutvkarshan kii bahari takaton ke virodh main / kii sahaayta ke bina sankeern kshetra main bahane main madad karti he
 And yes, stains can be good but ink stains are not good because they do not go away easily
 pakistan main vipakshi pakistan muslim lig ke pramukh navaj sharif ne raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari se kaha ki vah desh main loktantr ko majboot karne ke liye raashtrapati kii aseem shaktiyon ko choden
 The two leaders, however, could not agree on any time limit for this
 samvidhan ke 17wein sanshodhan ko nirast karne kii mangarashtrapati asif ali jaradaari or purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke bich teen maheene se adhik samay main pehali baar mulaakaat hui he
 The meeting was held between Sharif and Zardari on the sidelines of a dinner in honor of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who visited Pakistan
 sharif ne kaha ki sattarudh pakistan pipuls party ko bina kisi deree ke samvidhan ke 17wein sanshodhan ko nirast karnaa chahie
 Through this, the President has got unlimited powers
 1973 ke samvidhan ko lagu karne kii apilpakistan muslim lig-en ke varisht netaa raja jafrul haq ne baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki navaj sharif ne kaha ki desh main loktantric sansthaaon ko majboot banane tathaa desh kii sthiti ko or behatar banane ke liye 17wein samvidhan sanshodhan ko nisst kiya janaa aavashyak he
 According to Haq, he also appealed to implement the Charter of Democracy and the 1973 Constitution
 kuch samay pehle Jabra ne bharat main wireles yearbads Elite 65t ko launch kiya tha
 The company has priced it at Rs 12,999
 hamane is wireles yearbads ko lambey samay tak upyog kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 In the market, it competes exclusively with Apple earpods
 bilt quality or dizin:jabra ke ye yearbads plastic ke bane hue hai
 Their ear tips are made of silicone
 inke saath charging cese bhi diya gaya he jo ki yearbads ko kairi karne ke saath-saath charge karne ke bhi kaam aata he
 Both look quite premium
 rhite said ke yearbad main power on-of kaa batan diya gaya he jo personal assistant jaise- google assistant ko active karne kaa bhi kaam karata he
 For this, you have to press and hold the button for three seconds
 saath hi isi batan se kol ko cat or risive karne jaisaa function bhi kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, when talking about the left side earbuds, here are two buttons
 jo mujeec trek ko badalane ke kaam aata he
 They also work to increase and decrease the volume
 ye saare batan kaaphi smood hai or inhen oparate karne main kisi tarah kii koi takalif nahin hoti he
 Type b port is given in its charging case
 box contate kii baat karen to yahaan aapako ek premium box miltaa he or box ke andar charging cese, microdhushbh cabel, quick start guide or silicon tips ke teen set die gaye hai
 Performance and Audio Quality: These earbuds are of IP67 rating
 yani ye water or dust racistant hai
 They are very light weight and easily fit into the ears, although they cannot be considered comfortable for long-term use
 kaanon main behtareen fitting milti he, lekin fitting thodi tite lagane lagati he
 Talking about its microphone, it is quite brilliant, that means you will not need to see the phone when a call comes and you will be able to pick up the phone with a single touch
 saath hi kol ke dauraan sender or resiver donon kii aawaaj behatar bani rahati he or baahar kii awaajen bilkul aapako pareshaan nahin karti hai
 These earbuds support both ios and Android devices
 inke behatar experions ke liye yugers Jabra Sound+ ap downlod kar sakate hai
 This is not mandatory but many types of functions can be controlled through this app
 udhaaharan ke taur par bataa den inhen ambioons ke hisaab se set kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the audio of the call as well as the music audio can also be changed through the equalizer
 virtual personal assistant kii setting kii ja sakati he
 Apart from this, auto pause can also be set, that is, if either of you remove the earbuds, then the music will stop automatically and if it is kept aside for more than 60 seconds, the music will not be resumed
 compatibility kii baat karen to ye ek baar kisi bhi divaais se conect hone ke baad bluetooth on hote hi auto conect ho jaataa he or isaki connactivity kaaphi shandaar he
 Sometimes the connection stops for a few seconds due to sudden jerk while traveling
 ab agar audio quality kii baat karen to ye sabase shandaar hissaa he in yearbads kaa
 Whether speaking of low notes or all of high notes, the output is superb
 hamane tarah-tarah ke gane inke saath sune or sabhi kaa rispons behtareen aayaa
 We felt the inclination of these earbuds just a little bit for High Notes
 joki itani aasaani se samaj nahin aata
 Battery: The company claimed that it can be used continuously for up to 5 hours in a single charge and the company's claim is absolutely right here
 saath hi charging cese ke saath 15 ghante tak kii bydaree kaa laabh liya ja saktaa he
 That is, the earbuds can be charged even while traveling along with the charging case
 haalanki charging cese kaa bhi charge hona jaruri he
 The special thing is that these earbuds charge too quickly
 faisla:agar aap puri tarah se ek wireles yearphone kii talash main hai yo Jabra kaa ye audio product aapke kaam jarur aayega
 Be it battery or audio quality, these earbuds are far ahead in all respects
 saath hi inkaa luk bhi kaaphi premium he
 Using them only for long periods of time can cause difficulty
 iske alaava keemat bhi thodi kam rakhi ja sakati thi
 However, you can invest money in terms of product quality

 sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne kaha ki aaj ke faisle se ye sabit ho gaya he ki 'satya pramanit hota he'
 When the question was asked to Sadhvi Pragya that a petition has been made on the basis of her health, Sadhvi Pragya Thakur said that 'truth has won on the basis of her issues
 'bhopal ke jawahar nagar aria main prachaar ke dauraan sadhvi ne unke khilaaf lagaai gai yachika ko virodhiyon kaa shadyantr qaraar diya
 Sadhvi said that 'this is a conspiracy and those who are conspirators will always be defeated like this
 ' sadhvi ne bataaya ki 'unke saath doctor bhi rahete hai or saath main ve sab log bhi rahete hai jo unhen lekar ke chalate hai or ilaaj bhi karte hai
 In such a case, it is wrong to mock his health by petitioning

 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa 3 hajaar karod kii maang karnaa galat he
 Thousands of crores of Delhi government's land with DMRC: Gehlotamar said that being 50 percent entitled in the metro, he was asked to call a board meeting to ask the reason for increasing the fare
 dilli sarkaar kii hajaaron karod rupye kii jameen metro ke paas isliye he taaki janata par kiraye kii maar na pade
 If the purpose of earning revenue is not being fulfilled, then real state metro should not have it
 gahalot ne kaha ki honkong ne real state se 7 hajaar karod rupye kamaaye
 At the same time, Delhi Metro earned 400 crores
 agar diarector ke kehane par board kii meeting nahin bulaai jaati he, to yah dmarsi ke niyamon kaa ulanghan hoga
 In this case, necessary action will be taken as per rules
 'prati parivaar badhegaa 5 hajaar kaa boj'unhone kaha ki metro kaa kiraaya badhanaa janvirohi he
 Metro is not a company to earn profit

 If the largest slab increases by Rs 20, then the movement is Rs 40
 aise main ek ghar main 4 log hai, jo metro se safar karte hai to unke parivaar par 5 hajaar rupye kaa boj bad jayega

 Former West Indies captain Richie Richardson has seen Chris Gayle become the most explosive batsman in the world at the present time but believes that Sir Vivian Richards used to give the bowlers more panic than this Jamaican opener
 richardsan ne kaha, ‘‘donon (gail or richards) kaa apane yugon main gendbaajon par bahut gaharaa prabhaav rahaa he
 But if i take a closer assessment, the international bowler would have preferred to bowl to Gayle more than Richards

 bharat sarkaar ne watsap se maang kii thi ki wo massej ke strot kaa pataa lagane ke lagane or use trek karne ke liye tul lekar aae
 But whatsapp says that finding the source of the message will be like weakening the end-to-end encryption and it will also affect the user's privacy

 The IT Ministry has written twice to whatsapp to stop such rumored messages while following the law

 However, whatsapp does not agree to this demand of the Government of India
 kyonki company ne kaha he ki watsap kisi massej ko tres karne ke liye koisoftwarenhin bana saktaa he

 munwwar rana
 One such name in the world of Urdu poetry which made Mehbooba stand against her mother
 ve sahitya aaj tak ke manch se apane shrotaaon se rou-ba-rou hue
 Shams Tahir was the moderator of this session of Munavvar Rana in this literary event till date
 is satr main unhone siyasat, samaaj, mohabbat or sabase jaruri maa par kai sher bhi padhe
 Munavvar was familiar with the audience in the style of the story
 unhone kaha ki is daur main jab mushkilen siyasat kii peeth par baithkar aa rahi hai,shaayari sajishonko khatm karne ke kaam aati he
 Munavvar says that when Balmiki can become a complete human being the creator of Ramayana, then a modest person can become something more good
 yadi wo mere ghar aata he to iskaa matlab he ki uske bheetar achchhai jinda he
 How did you make your mother the subject of your poetry? In my childhood i used to walk in sleep
 mere walid trek driver the
 The mother had all the responsibility
 garibi ke alam main khaane-pine kii dikkat thi
 There was no problem of eating and drinking, so mother used to send us to the grandmother's house
 maa ko is baat kaa dar tha ki kahin main kuen main dub na jaaun
 So she would sit on the edge of the well of her house
 dua karti rahati
 When i visited my friends, i found that everyone's mother is the same
 kalakatta pahunchaa to vahaan sher suna
 There, a professor Saab, while teaching Ghalib, narrated a lion by Abbas Ali Bekhud
 neend uski he, dimag uskaa he, raaten uski jisaki shaanen par teri julfe pareshaan ho gayi
 On the question of a student that there may be lice in Mehbooba's head
 professor ne kaha ki wo gaalib kii mahabuuba he tumhaari nahin
 When Tulsidas's Mehboob Rama might be there, i thought my mother would be my lover
 pichley 45 varshon se is par likhane kii koshish main hum
 i tried what was right for me - is tarah wo mere gunahon ko dho detii he,maa adhik gusson main hoti he to ro detii he
 Mother used to be happy during Mushaira in the city
 pehle log gyaan or ilmaseekhney ke liye mushaaironmen jate the
 They narrate an incident
 kisi postmortem house yaa aspataal main maa apane bachche ko jism se chune ke bajaay peshaani se pahchaan leti he
 No matter how dark it is, the mother recognizes her child in a pesky manner
 ve hazrat musa ke saath ek vaakye kaa zikr karte hai ki musa ke itaraa kar chalane par log musa par tanj karte hai ki aise itaraa kar na chal
 Now there is not even your mother whose prayers used to save you
 pehle ham ganga, jamuna, saraswati yaa gaay ko maa maanate the
 Now Maruti has started to replace cow
 pehle ham gaay ko maa samajhate the ab maa ko gaay samajhate hai
 i would consider it an achievement to demolish an old age home
 ek taraf maa ko itnaa bada darja vahiin duusari taraf jhagade parama-bahanonke liye hi gaaliyaan-maa kii takat hoti he ki ambani bandhuon kii maa ke maujuud rahane par jhagada nahin hota
 i believe that if Nehru and Jinnah's mothers were alive, it would not have been divided
 koi sarhad nahin hoti, ye galiyara nahin hotengar maa bich main hoti to yah bantwaaraa nahin hotakisi ke jakhm par chahat se pattee koun baandhegaa,agar bahanen nahin hongi to raakhi koun baandhegaatumhaari mehphilon main ham bade-buudhe jaruri hai,agar ham hi nahin honge to pagadi koun baandhegabulandiyon kaa bade se bada nishaan chuaa,uthaaya god main maa ne tab aasmaan chhuaapane ghutane ke chah baar khole jane ke sawaal par ve kehete hai ki ghutana bhale hi itani baar kholaa gaya ho, magar ankhen aaj bhi thik hai
 i read easily
 mukhtsar hote hue bhi jindagi bad jaaegi,maa kii ankhen chuum lijai roshni bad jaegiudas rakhane ko acha nahin bataata he,koi bhi jehar ko meetha nahin bataata haikal apane aap ko dekha tha maa kii ankhon main,ye aainaa hamen boodha nahin bataata hapehle jahaan kapade par dhyaan rakhte the vahiin ab dawa lekar chalate hai
 Do not get the address there main jab ghar se nikalataa hum to dua saath chalati he,abhi maa jinda he meri, mujhe kuch nahin hogasamaji bebasii har shahar ko makatal banaati he,kabhi naksal banaati he, kabhi chambal banaati haijra si baat he lekin hawa ko koun samajhaae,die se meri maa meri liye kaajal banaati habulandi der tak kis shaks ke hisse main rahati he,bahut oonchi imaarat har ghadi khatre main rahati haibahut ji jahta he kaid-e-jaan se ham nikal jaaen,tumhaari yaad bhi lekin isi malbe main rahati he
 This is a loan that i cannot afford to pay until i return home, my mother is always in trouble, but she is a mother who is not angry with me
 a lion is present in cities like Delhi and Delhi - Smoke Catching carts, those who put out fires are not punished
 i wish that i could become an angel again, cling to my mother in such a way that the child should become a political scholar on the question of politics
 Do procedures do not feel good, but ran again say do not do Lgtave not good patch are that Shire gesture
 samajhane kaa kaam janata kaa he
 He recounts his journey to Benares that one sir met a great love
 banaras par unhone ek sher padhaa-mohabbat main rahe or aansu bahaanaa nahin aayaa,banaras main rahe or paan khaanaa nahin aayaa
 Today, on the question of notes, he says that - every person started to look suspiciously, i am a note of five hundred
this round is worth thousands of notes, Gandhi has also risen, and fifty four people give advice, do not vote
 chote log bachat karte hai
 The government should hold black people instead of black money
 ve lakhanu ke hone or apane landan jane kaa zikr karte hai ki vahaan pehle aap kis kadar chalata he
 They mention a urinal
 ve qatari main khadey the or pehle aap - pehle aap karne kii vajah se ek angrej tak ne puch daalaa ki kya ve india main lakhanu se hai
 They finally narrate an existing lion that Shahabuddin read in a program on Rajat Sharma's channel India TV
 bas isi baat par usne balavai rakkha he,ki hamaare ek bartan par iesai likkha he
 When a girl later asked him how this lion reached Shahabuddin, he told Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas to reach every corner of the world
 ve kehete hai ki shaayar kaa kaam shaayari karnaa he
 It is the job of the postman to transport them here and there
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne twanti20 vishwa cap se team ke jaldi baahar hone ke liye deshavaasiyon se maafee maangate hue sweekaar kiya he ki england ke khilaaf super aath charan ke match main ravinder jadeja ko yuvaraj singh se pehle bhejnaa unki galati thi
 We will prove ourselves, disappointed after losing by three runs on Sunday night at Gaylords, Dhoni said that we are more disappointed than you
 ham apane prashansakon or deshavaasiyon kii bhaawanaaon kii kadra karte hai
 We did our best and we are saying this with an open heart
 ham kuch bhi chipa nahin rahe
 After nine months, there will be a Twenty20 World Cup and we will prove ourselves in that
 dhoni ne yuvaraj or apane se pehle jadeja ko ballebaaji ke liye bheja jisane 25 ran banane main 35 genden kheli
 This put pressure on the other batsmen in the middle overs and India were eliminated from the tournament after losing the match by three runs
 dhoni ne kaha kai baar aapako pataa nahin chalata ki kya hoga
 We felt that while giving stability to the innings Jadeja would also play aggressive shots
 usne koshish kii lekin kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 This trick did not prove effective
 ravinder jadeja kaa khelaane kaa faisla sahidhoni ne haalanki pragyan ojha kii jagah jadeja ko team main shaamil karne or tas jitkar kshetrarakshan ke apane faisle ko sahi tehraaya
 He said that we were looking for a combination that would give depth to the batting
 hamen nichle kram se bhi achche pradarshan kii darkaar thi
 Ojha is a good bowler but Jadeja is an excellent fielder and all-rounder
 isse hamen ek atirikt tej gendbaaj ko shaamil karne main bhi madad mili
 Dhoni said that as far as the first fielding is concerned, we felt that the wicket would be better for batting in artificial light
 bhartiya captain ne haar ke liye apane ballebaajon ko doshi tehraate hue kaha ki 154 ran kaa lakshya hasil nahin kar paane ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 He said we failed to bat
 yadi virdohi team ne 153 ran banaaye hai or is wicket par ham use hasil nahin kar paye to mujhe nahin lagata ki iske liye koi tark diya ja saktaa he
 He said that we lost because we did not bat well
 main gendbaajon ke pradarshan se khush hum
 From shortpitch balls, England batsman Havidhoni admitted that the English bowlers had dominated the Indian batsmen with their shortpitch balls
 unhone kaha england ke gendbaajon ne aakraamak shuruuaat kii or bounsar kaa bakhubi istemaal kiya
 Our batsmen could not change their strategy suddenly
 main jaldi hi vaapasi karuungipane farm ke bare main dhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki vah aakraamak paariyaan nahin khel paa rahe hai lekin vah phir apane balle se bade shaat khilne ke liye kaaphi mehnat kar rahe hai
 He said i could not hit sixes consistently
 main mehnat kar rahaa hum lekin yah khel sirf chakke lagane ke bare main nahin he
 i hope to return soon
 dhoni ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki pichley chah maheene se lagaataar cricket khilne kaa team ke pradarshan par asar padaa
 He said i will not make an excuse for this
 main ipel ko bhi dosha nahin detaa
 No one can say that my team or i did not contribute 100 percent of the matches
 yadi koi aisa kahata he to mujhe bahut bura lagegaa
 Not the worst career loss Dhoni did not consider this defeat the worst defeat of his career, nor did he believe that it would have a bad effect on cricket in India
 unhone kaha mujhe nahin lagata ki iskaa bharat main koi bura asar padegaa
 We were also eliminated from the 2007 World Cup and that was the worst defeat
 lekin hamane vaapasi kii or lagaataar shrinkhlaayen jeetin

 - Input IANS ek tej bhaagti arthvyavastha main notebandi (dimonetigeshan) thik usee tarah he jaise ek tej raftaar racing car ke pahie par goli maarna
 This is to say that of Dreze
 peshey se arthshaastri or upie kaarykaal ke dauraan neshnal adwijuri council ke sadsy rahe zyaan drez ne ek bijness akhbaar ko die intervyuu main kaha ki notebandi kaa faisla un logon ke liye ek bhayaavah sthiti paidaa kar rahaa he jo garibi rekha ke neeche hai
 Zyan Dreze believes the move has been targeted by opposition parties
 notebandi par jari bahasamen ek bhram haaavee he ki iskaa sidhaa asar arthvyavastha main maujuud blikemani par padegaa
 Huge claims are being made to throw black money out, crush the shadow economy, and perform surgical strikes against the parallel economy
 yah daawey sarkaar or uske paksh main khadey logon dwaara notebandi ko jaij tehraane ke liye ho rahe hai
 It can be said that this claim is based on the accumulation principle of black money, according to which, where there is a pile of black money, it automatically grows, so it is necessary to clean it
 yah siddhant puri tarah se galat he
 a rascal with black money knows better ways to keep his black earning cash in a suitcase
 vah apni kaali kamai ko kharch karata he, nivesh karata he or cash ko kisi anya rup main badal letaa he
 He buys property, blows up on expensive weddings, goes shopping in Dubai or spends to please politicians
 haalanki yah bhi satya he ki kisi die samay main kuch kalaadhan uske paas rasoi ke dibbe yaa takiya kii khol main bhi padaa ho
 But the practice of taking out the remaining black money is the same as running a shower in the room
 lihaaja is kadam ko kaledhan ke khilaaf sargical strike kii sangya dena mahaj ek bhram he
 Many economists from all over the world have made this argument, but the government is feeling its own euphoria
 kaledhan kaa sanchay karne kaa kaam sambhavat: raajnneetik dal karte hai
 It is logical for them to collect large amounts of cash so that the election campaign can be made easier
 vipakshi dal notebandi ke pramukh torget hai
 This will have less impact on the ruling party
 haalanki jon drej kehete hai ki vah raajnneetik dalon dwaara jari farjivaadon ke sakht khilaaf hai lekin maanate hai ki yah tarika raajnneetik dalon ko thik karne ke liye uchit nahin he

 beijing iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan he
 If Beijing's air can clear then why not here
 vahiin, tiemasi saansad ne mask pahanakar apni baat rakhi
 TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh said whether a mission like Swachh Bharat cannot be for clean air
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko is maamle ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie or is ek rashtriya mishan bananaa chahie taaki aane vaali pidiyon ko saaf hawa mil sake
 BJP MP from East Delhi seat Gautam Gambhir also spoke
 unhone kaha ki vaayu pradooshan se har teen minute main 1 bachche kii maut hoti he
 We should think of a log-term solution instead of a shortcut, otherwise our children will have to pay a big price for it
