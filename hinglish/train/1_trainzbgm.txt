 gujarat ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua ki badi sankhya main ipies adhikari rajya ke chif secretary ke paas pahunche or shikaayat kii ki rajya main tarakkee ke maamle main unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 He says that in most states of the country including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Kerala, Maharashtra, 1990 batch IPS officers have been made additional dgps from igs, but in 1987 only 1987 batch was promoted, but in that Even half a batch was not promoted
 yani, agar dilli main deshbhar ke ipies adhikariyon kii koi baithak ho to 1990 tak ke zyaadaatar adhikari adishnal dijipi ke taur par usamen shirkat karenge, lekin gujarat ke usee batch ke adhikari aiji ke taur par, or der se pramotion milane se aarthik nuksaan to hota hi he
 The complaint of IPS officers is that the entire promotion structure has been ruined in Gujarat
 aamtaur par har saal 31 disambar tak vaarshik gopneey report (annual Confidential Report - yaa asiaar) ban jaati he, lekin gujarat main ipies adhikariyon kii asiaar banane kaa koi system nahin he, or iske aadhaar par pramotion kii sifarish karne vaali departmental pramotion cameti kii baithak bhi niyamit rup se nahin hoti, yani, pramotion kaa puraa dhaancha thik nahin he
 The officials complained that due to this injustice, the morale of police officers in the state has dropped significantly

 The government has currently assured them that action will be taken in this matter soon and the structure will be rectified, but officials say that trust will not be returned until the promotion is received

 ) world cap qualifaaing main guam main khele gaye group-di ke duusare match main bhi bharat ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In the second match of Group D, Guam defeated India 2–1
 bharat kii ore se iklauta gol captain sunil chhetri ne kiya
 Captain Chhetri made history by scoring his career's 50th goal in injury time, but this did not affect the results of the match
 group-di main bharat ko ab iran or turknamenistan ke khilaaf match khilne hai
 The comments footbal visheshgy nuvi kapadia kehete hai, meri yaaddaasht main ye bharat kii sabase buree haar he
 He says India's world ranking is 141 while Guam's 174
 bharat ke khilaadiyon ko karod rupee se zyaada salanaa kamai hoti he
 The population of India is close to 125 billion, while the population of Guam is slightly more than one and a half million
 vah kehete hai ki aisi team se bhi jeet ke liye aapako or kya chahie? nuvi 2001 main brunei ke khilaaf hue match kii yaad dilaate hai
 He says that at that time India won Brunei 5–0 in Bengaluru and then 4–0 in the match played in Brunei
 nuvi kehete hai ki sunil chhetri ne 50waan gol (87 match) kiya he yaa nahin isse fark nahin padataa
 It is obvious that the Indian football team and coach Stephen Constantine will need to do a lot of work and perhaps consider the whole strategy
 captain chhetri ne injuri time main apane kariyar kaa 50waan gol kar itihaas to kaayam kiya, lekin isse match ke nateezon par koi asar nahin padaa
 In Group D, India now have to play matches against Iran and Turkmenistan

 He says what more do you need to win from such a team? Nuvvie is reminiscent of a 2001 match against Brunei
 vah kehete hai ki us vakt bharat ne brunei ko bengalooru main 5-0 or phir brunei main khele gaye match main 4-0 se jeet hasil kii thi
 Nuvvi says that it does not matter whether Sunil Chhetri has scored the 50th goal (87 matches)

 Scientists have discovered a new planet 'super Earth'
 is grah kaa vajan dharti se 5
 4 times more
 is grah ko 'jije 536bi' naam diya gaya he
 Scientists say that it is orbiting around a very bright star (red dwarf) near the Sun and is about 33 light years away
 'jije 536bi' taron ke awasaiya kshetra main nahin he lekin 8
 Its short 7-day rotation period and its brightness make it an attractive object
 haalanki super arth par jivan kii sambhaavna kitni he, is bare main abhi tak pataa nahin chal paaya he
 But humans have a tendency to always look for alternative planets, even about migrating to another planet
 kepler-452beaprail 2014 main nasa ke kepler mishan ne dharti jaisaa grah milane kii pushti kii thi
 The size of this planet is also equal to that of the Earth
 yah aisi jagah sthit he jahaan insaanon ke rahane ke anukool maahaul he
 The Kepler 452B is 60 percent larger than the Earth but its orbit is just 5 percent longer
 yah grah 385 dinon main surya kaa chakkar lagaataa he
 The possibility has been raised that the surface of this planet is stony and the rays of sun work throughout it so that life is expected
 yahaan kaa taapmaana na to zyada thanda he, na hi zyada garm

 0 kyon?kepler 452bi kii sthiti aisi he jo ise arth 2
 Makes 0
 jaisaa ki pehle bhi bataaya ja chukaa he, yah grah 'awasaiya jone' main he
 That is, the temperature here is such that there will be no problem in making water
 yani maanav kii basaavat yahaan sambhav he
 How far from us? Now let's talk about the distance from the planet Earth
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kepler 452bi dharti se 1400 prakaash varsh dur he
 a light year 5
 88 kharab mile ke baraabar hota he
 This means that if a spacecraft is released at the speed of light, it will take one and a half thousand years to reach this planet
 lekin prakaash kii gati 670 arab mile prati ghanta hoti he or abhi kaa sabase tej gati se chalane vaala maanavrahit antariksh yaan he 'new horijan' jo 35 hajaar mile prati ghante kii raftaar se chalata he

 The Delhi government spent lakhs of rupees on foreign visits of its ministers
 ek artiai ke jawaab main khud dilli sarkaar ne ye mana he ki teen mantriyon ne aath baar videsh yatra kii he or iskaa kharch sarkaar ne uthaaya he
 40 lakhs spent on eight foreign trips, Aam Aadmi Party ministers are visiting abroad and that too on government expenditure
 chaunkaane vaali jaankaree ye he ki aath videsh yatraaon par teen mantriyon ne kareeb chalis lakh rupee kharch kar die
 Activist and BJP leader Vivek Garg had asked the Delhi government to give details of foreign visits of ministers and government expenditure incurred on them
 artiai se hua khulhasartiai ke mutabik 2015 se 2016 ke bich satyendra jain teen baar videsh gaye
 This includes travel to Manchester, Sweden and Malaysia
 isamen manchester kii yatra main ashish khetaan bhi shaamil the
 It cost Rs 783403 for this three-day foreign trip
 jabaki sweden or malaysia yatra par kareeb paanch lakh rupee kharch hue
 About four lakh rupees were also spent on Gopal Rai's only foreign trip
 wo videsh yatra par sweden gaye thevidesh yatra par hua kharch RTI kii report se bhi zyaadadilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya bhi artiai ke mutabik dedh saal main chaar baar videsh yatra par ja chuke hai
 This includes travel to London, Australia, Germany
 manish sisodiyaki ek yatra par to nau lakh se zyada kharch hue hai
 According to Vivek Garg, who filed an RTI, the expenditure incurred on the foreign travel of ministers is more than the response received in RTI
 kyonki dilli sarkaar ne mantriyon kii videsh yatra kii tamaam jaankariyaan chupa lee hai
 Vivek Garg also alleges that the government has hidden the expenses incurred on the staff accompanying the ministers and the party workers in the name of government delegation
 aam aadmi party ne di safivahin dilli sarkaar ke peedbudy mantri satyendra jain se jab videsh yatraaon par hue kharch par sawaal kiya gaya to unki daleel bhi dilachasp rahi
 According to Satyendra Jain, the minister did not go for a tour but went abroad for government work
 unki sarkaar ke mantriyon kii videsh yatraaen duusare rajyon ke mantriyon kii tulana main kaaphi kam he
 The foreign visits of the Chief Minister are not included in these foreign visits
 saath hi haal hi main vatican main mukhyamantri ke saath gaye mantri satyendra jain kii yatra kaa kharch bhi shaamil nahin he
 LG office's eye on foreign travel files, but now LG office has also kept a watch on foreign trips
 alji ne mantriyon kii videsh yatraaon kii jaankaree maangi he
 According to sources, the files related to foreign visits of ministers are also being investigated by the three-member committee constituted by LG
 sutron ke mutabik is baat kii bhi padtaal kii ja rahi he ki videsh yatraaon par kharch kii alji se manjuuri lee gai thi yaa nahin

 In Bihar, seats have been divided between the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies Janata Dal United (JDU) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)
 ravivaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki unki party 17, nitish kumaar kii jediu bhi 17 or ramvilas paswan kii algepi 6 siton par chunaav ladegi
 If we talk about the last election, then the BJP seems to be at a loss
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 29 or algepi 7 siton par chunaav ladi thi
 Of this, BJP won 22 seats and LJP won 6 seats
 jabaki jediu endie se alag 38 siton par ladi thi or vah sirf 2 hi seat jeet pai thi
 In such a situation, now questions are being raised whose JDU with two mps contesting the seats equal to the BJP with 22 mps shows whose weakness and strength? Such a question has also been raised by Leader of Opposition in Bihar and Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA Tejashwi Yadav
 , But moving ahead, he has described the entire NDA as weak
 tejasvi ne 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ke gathbandhan kii haalat patali bataate hue likhaa, 'janadesh chori ke baad bhi BJP bihar main itani majboot hui ki 22 vartmaan saansad hone ke baavjood 17 seat par chunaav ladegi or 2 MP vaale nitish ji bhi 17 seat par ladenge
 Now understand how thin the situation of NDA is
 'tejasvi ke is akalan ke alaava seat formule se duusari tasviir yah bhi ubhari he ki bijepi ko 2014 kii tulana main bada nuksaan hua he
 While Ram Vilas Paswan has managed to retain his old status
 LJP or JDU ko 2 saal baad pradhanmantri modi se notebandi par sawaal poochne kaa faaydaa mila
 Even after the mandate theft, BJP became so strong in Bihar that despite having 22 sitting mps, it will contest on 17 seats and 2 MP Nitish ji will also fight in 17 seats
 ab samaj jaaiye NDA ke kitne patale halaat he— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)december 23, 2018tejasvi ke baad endie se alag hokar mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone vaale ralospa adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne bhi seat bantwaare par chutki lee
 He wrote in his tweet, 'twenty-six inch people bowed down in front of Nitish ji's jackal bhabki

 unhen narendra modi kii aguwai main chunaav ladane main aapatti thi
 After this, JDU fielded candidates in 38 seats, but all the candidates except Nalanda and Purnia seats lost

 vahiin, algepi apni jiti hui siton par yani khagadiya, jamui, munger, vaishali, samastipur or hajipur se chunaav lard sakati he
 Even though the BJP is going to contest in 2019 on fewer seats than in 2014, BJP President Amit Shah has announced the seats, claiming that the NDA will get more seats in the upcoming elections than in the previous election

 kitaab kaa naamah tumhaare sapane hue apane (your Dreams are Mine Now)lekhakah ravinder singhnuwadah prabhaat ranjanbuk kaverh paper baikamoolyah 150 ruperatin ***sapana har koi dekhtaa he
 Somebody's dream is to do something big, change the society and do something for the world that even after you go, people remember you
 lekin kya in sapanom ko puraa karnaa itnaa aasaan he? nahin, ye itnaa aasaan nahin he
 But the author Ravinder Singh has threaded this issue very beautifully in his new book Tumse Sapne Hua Apne

 Both have a different view of life
 rupali bihar kii rajdhani patna kii ladki he jiskaa dilli uniwarsity main admician hota he
 It was his dream to get admission in Delhi University and he also worked hard for this
 lekin rupali ko kya pataa tha ki dilli uniwarsity main admician ke baad se uski jindagi puri tarah se badal jaaegi
 Arjun is a Delhi boy and has an early interest in youth politics

 If you are getting bored and want to read a light love story then definitely read this book
 kyon naa padhein: kitaab kii sabase badi khami he ki dilli raajnneeti or pyaar ke bich main balance bahut acha nahin he
 In the book, politics is simply used in the background while love is explained very well

 do saal tak is maamle main sunwaayee chaliisi saal june main court ne sunaaya tha faisladilli sarkaar ditisi kii basen kharidne main lagaataar let hui, uske kai kaaran the
 One of which was a petition in the Delhi High Court
 is yachika main dilli sarkaar ke 2000 standard floor basen kharidne ke faisle ko chunauti di gai thi
 The trial lasted for 2 years and in June this year, the court gave its verdict
 yachika vakil nipun malhotra kii taraf se lagaai gai thi, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki viklangon kii avhelnaa karte hue dilli sarkaar lo floor bas kii bajaae standard floor basen kharidne ja rahi he
 In this case, the petitioner Nipun Malhotra said that the government did not consider it appropriate to buy low floor bus further, which was easy to use for the handicapped
 dilli sarkaar ko standard floor bason ko kharidne kii koi jarurat hi nahin thi, lekin sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad hameshaa is aadesh ko isliye chunauti di ki kyonki ye basen viklangon kii dikkaton ko or badhaane vaali thi
 The petition was filed by Nipun Malhotra in 2017, on which the Delhi High Court gave its order in June this year
 sarkaar ko 1000 standard floor basen kharidne kaa aadesh is shart par diya ki vah un sabhi bason main viklangon ke liye ramp lagaaegi
 Apart from this, the Delhi High Court said that the remaining 1000 buses will have to be purchased by the Delhi government for low floor only
 isse pehle 2015 main supreme court ne dilli sarkaar ko nirdesh diya tha ki dilli kii aabaadi ke hisaab se ditisi ke paas 10 hajaar basen honi chahie
 But even after 4 years, Delhi government is not in a better position in public transport
 philhal dilli main ditisi kii kareeb 5000 basen hai
 That is, half of the buses needed are currently being provided by the Delhi government to the public for public transport
 sarkaar ke standard floor bason kharidne ke faisle ko jab court main chunauti di gai to court ne bhi sarkaar se yahi sawaal poocha ki kya dilli kii sadaken hajaaron nai basen laane ke liye upyukt he
 The court also had a question that in Delhi, where the problem of traffic jams is getting worse every day, will the Delhi government be able to create such an infrastructure by purchasing new buses and where the system of running and erecting these buses is really Be near
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii pratyaashee suchi main lakhanu cant seat se kisi ummidavaar kaa naam nahin diya gaya he
 This is important because the Samajwadi Party chief and the Chief Minister's father Mulayam Singh Yadav has fixed this seat for his younger son Prateek's wife Aparna Yadav
 mulaayam singh yadav ne 26-varshiya aparnaa yadav ko lagbhag ek saal pehle hi lakhanu cant seat se samaajawaadee party kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya tha
 Aparna is considered to be a member of the camp of Shivpal Yadav, uncle of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, with whom Akhilesh's war over power has 'split' the party
 is jhagade main mulaayam singh yadav ne ab tak puri tarah apane bhai kaa hi saath diya he, or akhilesh yadav ke samarthakon kaa aarope he ki party mukhiya ke duusari patni tathaa mukhyamantri kii sauteli maa ne hi mulaayam singh yadav ko akhilesh ke viruddh bhadakaayaa he
 These supporters of Akhilesh Yadav also believe that Aparna Yadav's political ambition is to become the young face of the Samajwadi Party in place of Akhilesh Yadav and then perhaps in time to become the chief ministerial candidate
 kuch maheene pehle akhilesh or shivpal ke bich jari jang charam par thi, or us samay saarvajanik ho gai, jab akhilesh yadav ke kareebi maane jane vaale vidhayak udaiveer singh ne mulaayam singh yadav ko likhakar kaha ki unke parivaar ke hi sadsy mukhyamantri ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 This was understood to be a gesture towards Mulayam's wife, which caused Mulayam to become very angry
 aparnaa yadav lakhanu cant vidhansabha kshetra main lagaataar dikhti rahati hai, lekin philhal is seat se reeta bahuguna joshi vidhayak hai
 The Samajwadi Party has never won the Lucknow seat
 sutron kaa kahana he ki aparnaa ne pehali baar chunaav ladane ke liye samaajawaadee party ke lihaaz se surakshit seat kii maang kii thi, lekin lakhanu cant seat par samjhauta karnaa padaa, or tabhi se vah vahaan prachaar kar rahi hai
 The comments akhilesh yadav kii saansad patni dimple yadav ko jitani aasaani se rajnatik kariyar banane kaa mauka mil gaya, bataaya jaataa he ki aparnaa ke man main usase khatas paidaa ho gai, kyonki aparnaa ke mutabik unhen dimple kii tulana main bahut zyaada mehnat kerani padi
 Aparna's husband Prateek is in a fitness business, and is not politically active, but the Akhilesh Yadav faction alleges that he has also played a role in creating a rift between his elder brother and father
 aparnaa yadav isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khuleam samarthan dene ke liye surkhiyon main ai thim, or varsh 2015 main mainpuri main hui mulaayam singh yadav ke pote kii shaadi ke maukey par aparnaa or unke pati pratik ne pradhanmantri ke saath selfi bhi khinchi thi
 She has also been very vocal in supporting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) all programs
 mulaayam singh yadav ne 26-varshiya aparnaa yadav ko lagbhag ek saal pehle hi lakhanu cant seat se samaajawaadee party kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya tha
 Aparna is considered to be a member of the camp of Shivpal Yadav, uncle of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, with whom Akhilesh's war over power has 'split' the party
 is jhagade main mulaayam singh yadav ne ab tak puri tarah apane bhai kaa hi saath diya he, or akhilesh yadav ke samarthakon kaa aarope he ki party mukhiya ke duusari patni tathaa mukhyamantri kii sauteli maa ne hi mulaayam singh yadav ko akhilesh ke viruddh bhadakaayaa he

 sutron kaa kahana he ki aparnaa ne pehali baar chunaav ladane ke liye samaajawaadee party ke lihaaz se surakshit seat kii maang kii thi, lekin lakhanu cant seat par samjhauta karnaa padaa, or tabhi se vah vahaan prachaar kar rahi hai
 The comments akhilesh yadav kii saansad patni dimple yadav ko jitani aasaani se rajnatik kariyar banane kaa mauka mil gaya, bataaya jaataa he ki aparnaa ke man main usase khatas paidaa ho gai, kyonki aparnaa ke mutabik unhen dimple kii tulana main bahut zyaada mehnat kerani padi
 Aparna's husband Prateek is in a fitness business, and is not politically active, but the Akhilesh Yadav faction alleges that he has also played a role in creating a rift between his elder brother and father
 aparnaa yadav isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khuleam samarthan dene ke liye surkhiyon main ai thim, or varsh 2015 main mainpuri main hui mulaayam singh yadav ke pote kii shaadi ke maukey par aparnaa or unke pati pratik ne pradhanmantri ke saath selfi bhi khinchi thi
 She has also been very vocal in supporting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) all programs
 is jhagade main mulaayam singh yadav ne ab tak puri tarah apane bhai kaa hi saath diya he, or akhilesh yadav ke samarthakon kaa aarope he ki party mukhiya ke duusari patni tathaa mukhyamantri kii sauteli maa ne hi mulaayam singh yadav ko akhilesh ke viruddh bhadakaayaa he
 These supporters of Akhilesh Yadav also believe that Aparna Yadav's political ambition is to become the young face of the Samajwadi Party in place of Akhilesh Yadav and then perhaps in time to become the chief ministerial candidate
 kuch maheene pehle akhilesh or shivpal ke bich jari jang charam par thi, or us samay saarvajanik ho gai, jab akhilesh yadav ke kareebi maane jane vaale vidhayak udaiveer singh ne mulaayam singh yadav ko likhakar kaha ki unke parivaar ke hi sadsy mukhyamantri ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 This was understood to be a gesture towards Mulayam's wife, which caused Mulayam to become very angry

 a few months ago, the ongoing war between Akhilesh and Shivpal was at its peak, and became public when MLA Udayveer Singh, considered close to Akhilesh Yadav, wrote to Mulayam Singh Yadav saying that his family members were targeting the chief minister
 Huh

 Aparna Yadav is a frequent figure in Lucknow Cantt constituency, but currently Rita Bahuguna Joshi is the MLA from this seat
 samaajawaadee party ne lakhanu seat kabhi nahin jiti he
 Sources say that Aparna had first demanded a safe seat for the Samajwadi Party to contest the elections, but had to compromise on the Lucknow Cantt seat, and since then she has been campaigning there
 tippaniyan As easily as Akhilesh Yadav's MP wife Dimple Yadav got a chance to make a political career, it is said that Aparna had a problem in her mind, because according to Aparna she had to work a lot harder than Dimple
 aparnaa ke pati pratik fitness bijnes main hai, or rajnatik rup se zyaada sakriy nahin hai, lekin akhilesh yadav gut kaa aarope he ki bade bhai or pita ke bich khai paidaa karne main unki bhi bhoomika rahi he
 Aparna Yadav had earlier hit the headlines for openly supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Aparna and her husband Prateek also took a selfie with the Prime Minister on the occasion of Mulayam Singh Yadav's grandson's wedding in Mainpuri in 2015
 vah bhartiya janata party (bijepi) sabhi kaaryakramon ko samarthan dene ke maamle main bhi kaaphi mukhar rahi hai

 The court has now given a new order in the Kanth case of Moradabad district in Uttar Pradesh
 elahabaad hoicourt ne kanth ke nayagaav akbarpur chendri main mandir par laudspikar lagane kii maang ko lekar daakhil janhit yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki iskaa faisla karne kaa adhikaar jila prashasan ko he
 a division bench of High Court Judge Justice Dilip Gupta and Justice MC Tripathi reserved its decision on this petition on Tuesday
 shanivaar ko adaalat ne chunnu singh or 10 anya logon kii daakhil yachika par apana yah faisla sunaaya
 The petition demanded that permission to install loudspeakers be given
 yachikakartaon ne adaalat se aagrah kiya tha ki unhen bhagwaan shiv ke mandir main har din subah or shaam ko kam se kam ek ghante laudspikar par bhakthi geet bajaane kii anumati di jaae
 He had urged that the only place of worship in his village is that temple and they have been worshiping there for more than 40 years
 baharhaal, adaalat kii raay thi ki jila prashasan or kshetreey pradooshan niyantran board kii anumati ke bina laudspikar kaa upyog karne kii anumati dena jaij nahin he
 The court said that people can approach the concerned authority on their demand and whatever decision is taken should be in accordance with the provisions of the 'noise Pollution Regulation and Control Rules, 2000'
 saath hi adaalat ne kaha ki police thanon ko yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki unke adhikaar kshetron main laudspikar yaa dhwani utpann karne vaali anya gatividhiyaan na hon
 If this happens, immediate action should be taken
 janhit yachika kaa nipataara karte hue adaalat ne kaha ki dhwani pradooshan se mukti kaa adhikaar ek moulik adhikaar he, jiske ulanghan kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 Significantly, after the uproar in Kantha on July 4, this town has become sensitive again due to political persistence

 The Delhi government and the central government have clashed several times from the district court to the Supreme Court, regarding what rights the central and state government have in Delhi
 lekin ab naubat ye aa gai he ki lagbhag sabhi bade maamalon main police kaa paksh rakhane ke liye dilli sarkaar or LG alag-alag vakil rakhte hai or donon vakeelon kii alag-alag raay ke chalate mahatvapurn maamalon kii yaa to sunwaayee tal rahi he yaa phir sunwaayee par hi ste lag jaataa he
 The result is the loss of the general public in this battle of Delhi
 ek maamle ke pairvi ke liye adaalat main do vakildrasal somnath bharti kii patni lipika mitra ne kareeb 5 maheene pehle yachika lagaai thi ki unke pati kii jamaanat ko khaarij kiya jaae
 But before the High Court decides anything on Somnath's bail, the two parties are fighting over who should put the Delhi Police's side in the case
 naaraaz court ne kaha ki ek hafte main wo khud tay karenge ki is maamle main abhiyojan paksh se vakil koun hoga? iske alaava darjanon maamle sirf hai court main hi pending hai jinpar koi faisla nahin ho paaya he kyonki vakeelon kaa takaraav court main lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 Many cases were pending in the battle of the two, it started with the notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs on 21 May 2015 in which LG was given the right to transfer posting of officers of Delhi Government
 jise lekar final order abhi bhi hai court main lambit he
 After this, there was a competition between the Center and the Delhi government to bring every case to the court
 jintendra tomars kaa farji degree kaa maamla ho yaa phir ACB ke dilli sarkaar ke adheen karne kii ladaai, jaranel singh ke avaidh nirmaan ko todane se rokane ko lekar vakeelon kii ladaai court main saaf dikhi
 The matter is also pending in the High Court for fixing the Delhi Government's Circle Rate
 CNG fitness scam main to court ne is ladaai ko dekhakar philhal sunwaayee par hi roak laga rakhi he
 While the LG appointed lawyers were opposing the bail in relation to whether Kanhaiya got bail in the JNU case, the Delhi Government's Standing Council was agreeing to grant him bail
 supreme court ne jald maamle sulajhane ke die aadeshkanoon ke mutabik land, lau and order or police centre ke adheen hai
 Delhi is not yet given full statehood
 jabaki dilli sarkaar kahati he ki grih mantralay ke prati javabdeh nahin he or grih mantralay ko dilli sarkaar ke aadesh ko radd karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Only the court has such authority and the court is unable to take any decision in time in the quarrel and exchange of lawyers
 haalanki supreme court ne nirdesh jarur die hai ki is maamle se jude lambit maamalon kii sunwaayee 31 july tak hai court puri kar le

 Hepakistani Mahilane has challenged the decision of the Hospital Committee in the High Court
 court ne kaha ki is tarah ke maamalon main sarkaar das din kaa samay nahin le sakati he
 Therefore, a decision should be made soon on the demand of the woman

 film singh sahab da great kii kahani khulti he ek patrkaar kii kalam se or bataaya gaya he ki kis tarah uttar pradesh ke ek chote se shahar kaa colector rajaneta or gundon kaa shikaar hota he
 Loses his wife and goes to jail under false charges of bribery but after coming out of jail, Voh Singh saheb fights the fight against corruption by carrying the flag of common man, which Arvind Kejriwal has brought down in the field of politics today
 90 ke dashak main dheron yaadgaar ection filmein dene vaale sani deol kii ek baar phir unke johnor main vaapasi kah sakate hai jahaan unka avatar angriman vaala he
 Fights against corruption
 dher saare dialogs hai or ection ke kai sundar drishy
 When Sunny Deol presses Prakash Raj with his hand, then there is the sound of a crackle of bone which suits Sunny
 nirdeshak anil sharma ke saath sani deol apane or gadar jaisi kaamyaab filmein de chuke hai or is film main bhi diarector−actor kii chemistry acchhee nazar aati he
 Sunny Deol plays a strong character in the film, while Prakash Raj has taken life in the role of Villan
 pichley kaafii samay se sani kii aisi film nahi ai thi jaisi unki image he or vah akasar kamedi karte nazar aa rahe the
 But now when once again the phase of action and spice films has started in Bollywood, Sunny's return to action is justified
 singh sahab da great ko bhi bollywood kii masala filmon se alag nahin kar sakate kyonki isamen ection he, drama he, imoshan he or thodi kamedi kaa tadakaa bhi
 Singh Sahab The Great is a hard-hitting film in which the romance angle seems a bit awkward

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream project Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has not completed even one year, and the head of this mission, Senior IAS Vijayalakshmi Joshi has taken voluntary retirement (VRS)
 pati ne pehle hi viares ligujrat cader kii iees vijayalakshmi joshi kii viares kii arjicendre sarkaarne manjuur bhi kar lee he
 She is currently working on a one-month notice period
 joshi ke pati bhi gujarat cader ke officer hai, jo pehle hi viares lekar america shift ho chuke hai
 That is why, according to sources, Lee Vrsi, Joshi was unhappy about the goals being set without any consultation and without clarity about the mission
 haalanki unki abhi tak pratikriya nahin mil pai he
 Retired Joshi three years ago, when she was selected for this mission, before that she was a secretary in the Ministry of Panchayati Raj
 abhi unki sarvice ke teen saal baaki the
 The results of the Swachh Bharat exercise did not come out as well as was expected and the pressure was also on Joshi
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle bijepi se nishkasit chal rahe saansad kirti jha aaazaad 15 farvari ko congress main shaamil honge
 He will join the Congress in the presence of Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Delhi
 iske baad wo 18 farvari ko apane sansadeey seat darbhanga main road sho ke jariye shakti pradarshan kar apni takat kaa ehsaas karaayenge
 Cricketer-turned-politician Kirti Jha Azad is the son of former Bihar Chief Minister Bhagwat Jha Azad
 bhagwat jha congress ke diggaj netaa rahe hai, aise main kirti aaazaad kaa congress se purana naata rahaa he
 In a way, he is returning home in Congress
 haalanki kirti aaazaad ne apni raajnneetik pari kaa aagaaj bijepi se shuru kiya tha
 But rebelling against Arun Jaitley cost him dearly and was expelled from the BJP
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kirti aaazaad ne bijepi ko alavida kehane kaa man bana liya he or congress ke haath ko thaamne ja rahe hai
 After joining Congress, he will try to create an atmosphere against BJP by visiting Mithilanchal
 haalanki kirti aaazaad ke congress shaamil hone ke baad asal sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki vah kis seat se chunaav ladenge
 He was elected from Bihar's Darbhanga Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 general election
 isse pehle 1999 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi isi darbhanga seat se wo chunakar sansad pahunchane main safal rahe the
 In such a situation, the question arises whether he will contest from Darbhanga or any other seat after joining the Congress, because Mukesh Sahni of VIP party of Mahagathbandhan has already announced to contest from Darbhanga seat
 iske alaava RJD ke ali ashraf fatmi bhi isi seat se daavedaar hai
 In such a situation, where will this seat go? ise lekar bhi rassakasi ho sakati he
 Not only Kirti Azad, many other stalwarts of Bihar can also join Congress
 isamen bihar ke bahubali netaa anant singh or purniya se bijepi ke netaa udai singh bhi congress main shaamil ho sakate hai
 In this way, Congress is going to give one big blow to BJP after another

 Pakistan's Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhary has once again become the Chief Justice after facing two years of exile
 unhone aadhi raat ke baad pad bhaar grahan kiya
 Nawaz Sharif's rebellion opened the way for the restoration of 10 judges
 haalanki iftikhaar choudhary kii dobaaraa bahaali ne musharraf or zaradaari kii niden uda di hai
 However, Gilani and Zardari had promised that if the Pakistan Peoples Party came to power, the sacked judges would be reinstated in Musharraf's time
 lekin gaddi paane ke baad ve is baat ko jaise bhul hi gaye the
 On this, Nawaz Sharif's party PML-N withdrew from the coalition
 is saal 25 farvari ko jab pakistan ke supreme court ne nawaz shareef ko chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy tehra diya or unke bhai shahabaaz shareef se punjab kii gaddi chhin gai to miyaan nawaz aag babula ho uthe
 He burnt the rebellion to overthrow the rulers, and he eventually won
 justise choudhary kii bahaali se sabase bada khatara musharraf ko he
 Musharraf must have been afraid that his truss might not be opened again if the arbitrations he had made under his rule
 isi vajah se ye charchaa bhi zoron par he ki parvej musharraf mulk chhod kar furr ho sakate hai
 Meanwhile, a petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki aatanrik maamalon ke mantralay ko aise nirdesh die jaaen ki wo musharraf kaa naam un logon kii list main shaamil karen, jo desh chhodkar bhaag sakate hai or unhen desh se baahar jane se roka jaae
 Clearly, this petition may have blown Musharraf's sleep
 gilaani or sharif kaa dostana unke liye pehle hi musiibat bana hua tha, ab iftikhar choudhary kii bahaali se unka pareshaan hona lazimi he
 At the same time, Zardari, who has been isolated in the new political equations, must have been afraid that if Justice Chaudhary had a feeling of revenge, his difficulties could increase manifold

 ek sitambar se hi jodhpur se laapata bhavari devi ke parivaar ne rajasthan ke mantri mahipal maderna par apharan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Bhanwari Devi's husband has also feared the murder of his wife
 aisi charchaa he ki bhavari devi ke mantri mahipal ke saath sambandh the or wo isaki ek sidi banaakar mantri ko blackmel kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, such rumors also spread that Bhanwari Devi's body was found in Jhansi area of orai but later this news came out false
 duniya main sabase zyada wicket lene vaale muthaiya muralidharan ne 2010 main aaj hi (22 july) ke din 800 wicket puure kiye the
 And with that, he said goodbye to Test cricket
 bharat ke khilaaf galle main siries kaa pehla test of spinner muralidharan ke liye yaadgaar rahaa
 Muralitharan, who had expressed his desire to retire even before the start of the Test, was only 8 wickets away from touching the magic figure of 800 wickets
 us test match ke tisare din tak unhen ek hi wicket mil paaya tha, vah wicket tha sachin tendulkar kaa
 Due to which the number of wickets reached 793
 match kaa doosraa din barish kii vajah se dhul gaya tha
 But India's fourth wicket fell on the fourth day, of which 5 wickets went to Murali's account
 paanchaven din foloon pari khel rahi team india match bachaane ke liye jujh rahi thi
 After VVS Laxman's run-out, Muralitharan needed just one wicket to complete his eight hundred wickets
 kai ne to aisa soch liya tha ki murali ke viketon kii sankhya 799 se aage nahin bad paaegi
 Eventually, Pragyan Ojha became his 800th victim
 vah sunaharaa kaich mahela jayavardhane ne pakadaa tha
 Like Richard Hadlee, Murali took a wicket on the last ball of his Test career
 mejabaanon ne yah test 10 wicket se jeeta
 Sri Lankan cricket officials invited all former Test captains of the country to this Test
 vivaadon main rahi muralidharan kii gendbajigauratlab he ki muralidharan kii gendbaaji ke tareeke par sawalia nishaan lagate rahe
 He has always had a flurry with Australian players and this was intensified during the 1999 tour of Sri Lanka in Australia
 australia ke purv wicketiper adam gilcrist ne apni aatmakatha main muralidharan ke mashhoor 'doosraa' par bhi sawaal khadaa kiya tha unhone aarope lagaaya ki isisi ne ise puri tarah parakhe bagaiyr aisi gendbaaji ko ijaajat de di
 Nevertheless, the highest wicket in Tests and odis was Muttiah Muralitharan played 133 Test matches and took a record 800 wickets
 shen worne unke peeche hai, jinke naam 708 wicket darj hai
 Muralitharan also took a record 534 wickets in odis
 wasim akram 502 wicket lekar duusare sthaan par hai
 In the last session of 'agenda Aaj Tak', megastar Amitabh Bachchan shared many untouched aspects and experiences of his life
 baatcheet ke kram main ve bhavuk najar aae
 Lyrics by Amitabh Bachchan, in his own words
 
 
 1
 i do not do anything new
 lekhak or diarector mere liye lekar aate hai
 i am lucky 2
 Shamitabh is releasing on 6 February
 balki kii film he
 Are male akshara hai, camel hasan kii choti beti
 3
 piku kii shooting kalkatte main kar rahaa hum
 Did the first job there
 grajuation ke baad dilli se naukari khojane kalakatta gaya
 Been seven years
 ab bahut badal gaya he
 When you go to those streets, you miss the old memories
 4
 i was there at the British Agency
 uske baad ek ishtehaar niklaa, filmphere or maadhuri magazine kaa
 Madhuri Dixit not
 ve hero talash rahe the
 Had to compete
 log applai karte the
 Then there was a screen test
 acting kaa namoona dikhaate the
 If elected, you would get five thousand rupees
 or takreeban chah bahut prakhyat diarectors ke saath kaam karne kaa avasar milegaa
 i applied shuruaati screening main hi fail ho gaya
 5
 mujhe rijection kaa aisa koi malaal nahin hua
 Then once he got there, he left his job and came to Mumbai
 6
 My favorite line in the tavern: This book was written in 1933
 1935 main pehali dfa uskaa prakaashan hua
 First heard at Kavi Sammelan at BHU
 takreeban 135 isaki panktiyaan hai
 When started, people did not let them stop
 unhen puri yaad thi
 i wonder if people still want to hear it
 babu ji gaakar sunaate the
 i do not deserve this
 7
 All the different paths, but i tell them
 ki raah pakad tu ek chalachal, pahunch jayega madhushaala
 
 
 Hate Extending Temple Mosque, Melati Tavern 8
 babu ji ne kabhi madiraa paan nahin kiya
 Used to be very surprised sharaab pite nahin to madhushaala kaise likh di
 There was a lot of opposition in that era
 kaha gaya, nayi peedi ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he
 Talk reached Gandhiji
 bulaayaa
 Gaya read what is written
 gandhi ji ne suna
 Then said, there is nothing wrong with this
 to batch gaye babu ji
 9
 pite nahin, to kaise likhte hai
 Babu ji has written
 kaaysthon ke kul main paidaa hue hai
 Which are famous for drinking
 prithviraj chouhan jab andhe kiye gaye or shahabuddin gauri ke darbar main unako laayaa gaya or kaha gaya shabdabhedi baan chalaaen chandbardaai ne ek chand padhaa tha
 How will the behavior be if different castes are made the head
 to babu ji ne likhaa ki kshatriya ko pradhan banaaenge to khayega or talwaar dikhayega
 If you become a baniya, then the house will be filled, the Raj will give someone else, if you become Kayastha head then you will drink all day
 10
 Hearing this, Babu ji wrote that i Kayastha Kulodbhav, my forefathers have molded me so much that 75 percent is in the blood of my body
 11
 He cried on my body, in whose tears, however, ah filled it, whatever it is, the alcoholic tavern
 12
 The tavern was very popular
 babu ji kaa kaam bahut vistaar main tha
 He taught English literature
 piechdi cambridge se kiya tha
 Doctorate on the eminent Irish poet Yeats
 chaar saal kaa kaam do saal main kiya13
 Sad that i got less time with Babuji
 unke man ko baton ko samajhane ke liye or vakt miltaa
 Now remember when i study
 14
 Nowadays, we see that everything is the life of Bhagdor
 babu ji ne likhaa he ki jivan kii apadhapi main, kab vakt mila, kuch der kahin baithkar ye soch saken, jo kiya, kaha, mana, kya thik kiya
 
 
 15
 hamaare jamaane main
 i am talking about 1958
 ghar main aisa maahaul tha ki ladke kii schooling ho gai
 Being a graduate was a big thing then
 aajkal ke noujvaan paanch chah saal kii umr main bataa dete hai ki kya karnaa he
 And there are big cricketers sitting here
 senior cambridge kiya, phir diu se grajuation kiya
 If you search for a job then you are not found anywhere
 frestrishan rahati thi
 So all the companions used to curse sitting in the coffee house of Delhi
 ham kehete the ki galati hamaari nahin he
 The mistake is of our parents
 paidaa kyon kiya
 i thought it was speaking the right thing
 jindagi main pehali baar oonche swar main babuji se baat kii
 i said, i found out the reason
 aapane mujhe paidaa kyon kiya tha
 Babuji remained calm
 kuch bole nahin
 We lived in Willingdon Crescent at that time
 babu ji subah 4 baje ghoomane jate the
 Then there was a lot of violence there
 babu ji subah jane lage
 Used to pick me up to read
 wo kaagaj chhod gaye bistar par
 There was a short poem on it
 raat ke sawaal main uttar likhaa
 Afraid of life and age, my sons ask me why i was born
 mere paas iske sivaa koi jawaab nahin ki mere baap ne bhi mujhase puche bina mujhe paidaa kiya tha
 
 
 You keep the new rut
 apane beton se puch unhen paidaa karnaa
 16
 babu ji ke saath mere rishte main thodaa tehraav or bhay tha
 He used to write continuously in the room
 anushaasan ke paband the
 There was not much talk
 kuch bada hua to baat thodi hui
 He had many qualities
 main sherwood college main tha, nainital main
 Drama for one year and got the Best Actor Award
 duusare saal bhi trophy jeetne kii ummid thi
 But two days before the performance i got measles
 mata-pita vahaan aspataal main mere saath the
 They kept talking to me for three to four hours
 tab babu ji ne gun kii baat bataai
 That it is good if it is of the mind, or not so good
 mujhe samaj nahin aayaa
 When asked, he said that if the mind is not there, then it is happening to the mind of the above, and he will never want anything bad for you
 17
 There are many things that will come out all night in Babuji's words 18
 jab shaadi kii thi to sochaa tha ki betaa hoga to vah meraa dost hoga
 i have always considered Abhishek as my friend
 kitaab main padhaa he
 Was over Pakistan
 vahaan kahawat he
 When the son wears the father's shoes
 tab vah betaa nahin mitra hota he
 Now Abhishek wears my pant coat
 juute bhi pahan lete hai
 i steal their things
 mitra kaa bhav rahata he
 Was different with Babu ji
 19
 Babu ji used to work in government
 ghar chalaane ke liye kai baar saadhan puure nahin ho pate the
 Many a time he used to go to the Poet Conference at night
 raat ke teen baje lautate
 Used to go to office in the morning
 main hi darwaja kholta
 i say, what do you do, so long
 vah kehete, betaa paisa, badi mehnat se miltaa he
 Then i moved into the industry
 teen shiften karata
 Returns at six in the morning
 babu ji darwaja kholte
 Speaking, this is the time to come
 main kahata, babu ji, paisa badi mushkil se miltaa he
 20
 main likh nahin paata hum
 Never even thought of such a profanity
 haa, samay par har jagah pahunchataa hum or script mehnat se padhata hum
 Daughter Shweta is writing a column in a newspaper
 padhata hum to acha lagata he
 21
 shahrukh khan mere parivaar ke liye kehete hai ki sab bachchan family main tip top rahete hai
 But they themselves remain tip top
 22
 Wasim Akram said, more fan than India in your Pakistan, we watched your film Kalia after waiting for three months
 unke liye koi sandesh denge
 23
 bachchan bole, meraa paariwarik rishta he
 My mother is from a Sikh family
 unki paidaaish faisalabad (pakistan) main he
 The study is from Lahore
 naanaa vahiin rahete the
 When he was two years old
 to vahaan le gai thim
 Don't remember much par pataa he ki vahaan bahut pyaar miltaa he
 Thank you very much to all of them
 24
 When i was injured in the shooting of Coolie
 us vakt jitani duaen bharat se milin, utani hi pakistan se milin
 Remember a special incident
 ek chota baccha, paak ke chote gaanv main rahata tha
 He used to run 15 km every day to the city to see the news of the newspaper, how is my health
 phir waapas jaataa tha
 This is a debt on me
 chahta hum ye bana rahe
 i am sitting in front of you with those blessings
 pakistan main mere chaahane waalon ko bahut bahut shukriya
 What to say 25
 Question of Babylon Supriyo
 aapke jaisi aawaaj kaa base hasil karne ke liye koi singer kya kar saktaa he
 Please, share your secret
 26
 Bachchan's question
 manyavar, iskaa uttar maa babu ji se poochna hoga
 My birth is his
 jo janm se mila
 i am presenting him only
 koi khaas kaarykram nahin kiya
 27
 kabhi kabhi mere dil main khyaal aata he
 If life had passed under the soft shade of your slaves, it could have been Shadab
 28
 Blue sky fell asleep
 is gane kii kahani
 i got the tune of this song from Shammi Kapoor Sahab
 hamaare unase paariwarik rishte hai ab
 Shammi always gave a lot of love
 ek film ham kar rahe the
 Under the name of Jamir
 shooting ke dauraan shaam ko mauka miltaa to shaam ko baithte
 Chanting a tune ye ek himachali dhun he
 He used to sing
 jab silsilaa ban rahi thi
 So during the music sitting, we were talking with Yash ji
 hari shiv dhun soch rahe the
 i told them
 gaakar sunai
 He liked it
 phir shammi ji ke paas gaya
 Told
 ijaajat maangi
 He agreed
 29
 Will i leave? kuch samaj nahin aata
 It does not want Abhishek to speak my dialogues, sing songs
 bas itnaa maan le ki main acha insaan tha
 Good friend, that's enough
 30
 In my view, my family's best film - this question has been asked
 magar raat main mujhe ghar mumbai lautnaa he
 And being hungry gustaakhee ho jaaegi
 If something is said
 baharhaal31
 Jaya's films were good
 unka chunane kaa maahaul sundar rahata tha
 She is not satisfied in the story, so she does not
 mili
 Abhiman, Piya's house, Guddi, are all good
 aishwarya ne abhi guzarish rithik ke saath kii thi
 He enjoyed acting
 abhishek film guru, maniratnam kii film main achche lage
 32
 mere jivan kaa sabase mahatvapurn kshan tha
 When i worked with Dilip Kumar Sahab in Shakti
 bachapan se unako mahanayake ke rup main mana he
 When the history of the film industry is written, it will always be before Dilip Kumar and after Dilip Kumar
 33
 It was wonderful to work with Dilip Sahab
 main nahin chaahunga ki kabhi shakti kaa rimek bane
 34
 raajnneeti mere liye ek bhavuk avasar tha
 After entering it, it was found that Bhavakuta and politics are different
 vahaan se isiilie haar maan lee
 i will not go back now
 35
 Had a difficult time
 kurki lag gai thi
 Went bankrupt
 100 ke lagbhag cese the
 Many people who wanted to work at one time
 ve aakar galigalouj karte the
 Used to threaten in sab duvidhaon se nikalne ke liye sochataa tha, kya karen
 There are so many problems
 raat bhar so nahin paata tha
 Then felt that he had come to act
 acting hi kerani chahie
 Woke up the next day and went to Yash Chopra and said, i don't have work
 or na hi paise hai
 He played the role of Narayan Shankar in love
 phir kaam nae sire se shuru hua
 The employees of Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank have been protesting against 'cross selling' from October 4 in ten cities of Rajasthan
 ‘cross sailing' ke khel ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 When the insurance company sells its product, it will hire employees, hire agents, and employment will also increase
 magar ab isaki jagah bank ke karmchaaree se kaha jaataa he ki aap bank kii sahyogi company ke beemaa product bechein
 The manager or employee of the bank is not capable of this task
 uskaa kaam bank kaa kaam karnaa he
 Handling your account, lending, etc
 lekin iske saath ab use beemaa utpaada bechney kaa target diya ja rahaa he
 To meet this target, bank employees lie to customers
 bagair uski jaankaree ke beemaa kar dete hai kyonki amuk sankhya main beemaa na karen to unka jivan dubhar ho jaataa he
 They are humiliated
 bank ke logon ne is amanviya vyavastha ko sweekaar kar liya
 Cross selling has mentally tortured bank personnel
 agar satyagrah par chalate hue kisi galat kaa virodh nahin karte hai to isi swikaarna hi kaha jayega
 As long as the ratio of immorality within you is high, you cannot be free from any exploitation
 ab bade-bade bainkon ke karmchaaree adhikari chup hi rahe lekin rajasthan marudhara gramin bank ke karmchaariyon ne virodh karnaa shuru kar diya he
 This is an interesting phenomenon
 iske liye unhone keemat bhi chukaai he
 The State Bank of India has suspended seven employees
 marudhara gramin bank kaa sangrakshan bhartiya state bank hi he
 Management has targeted every branch that 6 lakh SBI life (insurance product) has to be sold in a year
 25 lakh mutual fund bechney hai
 Over four lakh SBI General products are to be sold
 ek durghatana beemaa he or ek swasthya beemaa he
 Most of the customers of such a bank are of general economic background
 vaise bade bainkon ke bhi hote hai
 Now the bankers are told that when the farmers come to take a loan, insure it firmly
 esbiai general ke swasthya beemaa kaa ek saal kaa beemaa 10502 rupee he
 It may be that if the work of the farmer runs with Ayushman insurance, then why should he take this insurance? But the bankers lure them to meet their target and insure them and deduct the first premium from the loan amount
 lekin jab doosraa premium dene kii baari aati he to vah nahin de paata he
 At the same time, the loan amount is also reduced which he is unable to repay
 kisaan ko bhi dhokhaa miltaa he or bank kaa bhi enpie ho jaataa he kyonki uskaa diya gaya lone waapas nahin aata he
 Banks have looted the farmers of India in a big way through cross selling
 wo to kahie ki unhen yaa kisi ko bhi lagaataar dharmik rashtrawaad ke jhonke main rakhaa jaataa he isliye pataa nahin chalata he
 You have gone to the bank to withdraw money
 lone lene gaye hai
 Haven't even decided to have insurance
 sochaa bhi nahin he
 But a policy is imposed on you
 banker target puraa karne ke liye apane dost rishtedaaron ko bhi polisy bech rahe hai
 The same happened with the insurance schemes of the government
 kisi tarah bechaa gaya taaki sarkaar safal hone kaa daawa kare or aapse yah nahin bataaya gaya ki doosraa yaa teesraa premium bharaa gaya ki nahin
 Bankers are not only selling their bank products, they are also selling government products
 pehle bankeron ko iske liye kamishan kaa laalach diya gaya
 The Reserve Bank has clearly stated that commissions cannot be given, yet this work is going on
 cross sailing galat parampara he
 In 2016, the case of a bank in the us-based Wells Fargo came to light when the president of the bank had to resign
 cross sailing ko frad mana gaya tha
 The bank was fined hundreds of crores
 bharat main bhi Moneylife cross sailing ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya he
 indusind Bank broke a 79-year-old's fixed deposit and wrongly forced them to invest in other products
 samay-samay par reserve bank ke bade adhikari kah chuke hai ki bainkon ko is tarah ke product nahin bechney chahie
 The demand of the employees of Marudhara Bank is absolutely right that the accounts of the top management should be checked to know how much they are getting as commission
 ise kehete hai raajnneetik chetana
 In this context, the performance of the employees of Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank is important
 kam se kam unhone apane or dusron ke liye virodh to kiya
 It is expected that their fight will not be for getting commission but against the unethical tendency of earning by imposing insurance or wealth product on the customer
 is zulm se pareshaan duusare bainkon ke karmchaariyon ko bhi aage aakar marudhara gramin bank ke karmchaariyon kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 Even at the personal level, the bankers should clearly tell how many such customers in their bank on whom insurance was imposed, they could not pay after one or two premiums
 
 Who got more benefit from it? do premium chukaane ke kaaran kisaanon ke karze par kya asar padaa
 Bankers should secretly tell this to everyone
 ve shaadi main jaaen, bas main chal rahe hon to logon ko bataate chalem
 Make an anonymous poster and put it in place
 logon ke inbaks main chupchaap is tarah ke detail daal den
 Bankers have to earn moral strength
 itane laachaar or bhole nahin hai
 After the job of bank, it seems very brave to ask for dowry, now what has happened
 mahila bankeron ko bhi inbaks main pole khol deni chahie ki unhone jab ek banker se shaadi kii to dahez liya tha yaa nahin
 Men bankers should also do Satyagraha
 bataaen ki lone dete vakt kitna kamishan liya jaataa he, kyon log isaki shikaayat karte hai? in sab bahason se hi ham sabhi ke bheetar naitik bal aayega or hamaare jivan main pidaa kam hogi
 Writing Varna Ravish Kumar's posts or appearing on TV will not change
 jisaki unamem ghor kami he
 They are upset about these things but are not honest to erase it
 jo apane muddon ke prati eemaandaar nahin he usase dur rahanaa chahie
 So i closed the bank series
 aapkaa koi jaanane vaala bank main kaam karata he, to usase is bare main puche
 The silence on immorality is overshadowing the bankers
 do saal ho gaye magar unki selary abhi tak nahin badi
 Very few are forced to work in big cities in salary
 unke jivan main bahut pidaa he
 Officers within banks are being asked to buy shares of one lakh two lakh or five lakh
 unhen majaboor kiya ja rahaa he ki lone lekar apane bank ke share khreeden
 It is slavery by any definition
 bankeron ko pataa he ki galat ho rahaa he
 Since the political consciousness of most people (not just bankers) has become corrupt, they have started to tolerate every wrong
 andh rashtrabhakti main fanse log bhavuk or juthi baton par bhujaaen to laharaa dete hai magar apane saath ho rahe is tarah ke shoshan ke kilaaf budbuda nahin pate hai
 When the bankers do not worry about their self-respect, then who will do the other? Why would They are not alone
 unki sankhya lakhon main hai
 They are sucking the blood of the customer at the counter and the bank is sucking their blood
 sharmnaak he
 It states that 20 lakh people can be enslaved
 satyagrah karen
 Make your life pain free
 saral or sahaj banaaen
 i do not see your pain note- bahut se log bataate hai ki unki company ne teen maheene se selary nahin di he
 Send me the details of it main selary nahin dilwane ja rahaa
 Rather, i want to study how big a price is being collected from you by serving a lie on a Kashmir
 aap kaise detail bhejenge, yah aapako bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 i will know
 detail thik se den or eemaandaaree se

 In the higher reaches of Uttarakhand, the mercury started rising, but due to the sudden change in weather, Badrinath and Gangotri are experiencing snowfall
 isaki vajah se paara ludhakna shuru ho gaya he
 Earlier, the weather department had issued a warning that the temperature of the mountain would rise by eight to ten degrees in the next four-five days
 mausam vibhaag ne van vibhaag ko chetavanee jari karte hue kaha he ki ekaek taapmaana badhane se jangalon main aag lagane kii ghatnaayen bad sakati hai jiske liye pehle se hi taiyaari karne kii jarurat he
 But on the other hand, the weather has reversed
 badrinaath main bin mausambarfabaarishuru ho gai he to vahiin gangotri dham main bhi himpat ne apni chata bikherni shuru kar di he
 But this does not mean that the warning about the severe heat has been removed
 garmi or paare ke badhane ko lekar chetavanee ab bhi vaise hi jari he jaisaa ki pehle se mausam vibhaag ne bataaya hua he
 The Meteorological Center has issued a warning for the entire state
 isamen kaha gaya he ki uttarakhand ke parvatiy jilon main agle chaar se paanch dinon main taapmaana ausat se aath se das degree tak bad jayega
 This is an unusual temperature for mountainous regions
 andaja is baat se hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is samay mukteshwar main taapmaana 25
 It is 4 degrees, that is, there will be temperatures up to 35 degrees
 mukteshwar main itnaa taapmaana pichley bees saalon main kabhi nahin gaya
 Temperatures in plains districts can reach as high as 40 degrees
 badi aag lagane kii ashankis baar sardiyon main kam barish hone ke kaaran vaataavaran garm ho rahaa he or nami khatm ho rahi he
 So this boom in temperature is going to happen
 mausam centre ke nideshak bikram singh ne bataaya, parvatiy ilaakon main vaayu pradooshan maidan ke apeksha kam hota he
 Therefore, the sun will produce more heat as the air becomes dry
 ye sthit jangalon main aag ke liye mufeed hoti he
 Therefore, an alert has been sent to the forest department
 uttarakhand ke jangal main chid kii maatra bahut zyada hone kii vajah se garmiyon ke mausam main mana jaataa he ki garmi badhane se jangal main aag lagane kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Due to the way there has been a drop in the rain this time, it is being speculated that this time the forests will blaze very fast

 For women, the most precious thing is deep and in that too, Mangalasutra does not even let anyone touch
 lekin kya aap soch sakate hai ki ek mahila shauchalay ke liye apane gahane girvee rakhegi
 That too at a time when the government is subsidizing people to build toilets
 unhen prerit kar rahi he ki khule main shouch na karke shauchalay banavaayen
 But in Rohtas, Bihar, a woman got so tired after going round the government babu that she decided to get her jewelry pledged and made to be shaved
 rohtas jile kii vikramganj kii bahkhanna gaanv kii 30 varshiya phool kumari ne apane mangalsutra samet sabhi gahane girvee rakh kar ghar main shauchalay banavaane kii ek anokhi misaal pesh kii he
 This woman from Udaipur panchayat of Sanjhwhauli block, having a lot of government offices, was not able to build toilets in the house due to lack of money
 usne madad ke liye kai baar sarkari daftaron ke chakkar lagaaye, guhaar lagaai lekin koi madad nahi mili
 When he did not get help from the government which gave the slogan of toilet, he decided to make his own toilets
 gharavaalon ko bhi samajhaaii shauchalay kii ahmiyatyah nirnay aasaan nahin tha kisi mahila ke liye apane gahane or khaas kar mangalsutra girvee rakh kar shauchalay banvaanaa vaaki ek bada kadam he
 According to Phoolkumari, her mother-in-law and husband prevented her from pledging the jewelry, but she agreed to understand the utility of the toilet
 phulkumari ke mutabik khule main shouch main jane se saanp jaise jaanwaron ke khatre ke saath saath chhedhkhani kaa bhay hameshaa sataata tha isi se tang aakar usne ghar main shauchalay banane kaa faisla kiya
 To add the rest of the wages, the flower-bearer pledged his mangalsutra, including all the jewelery, to construct a toilet in the house
 shauchalay banavaane main 12 hajaar kaa kharch aa rahaa tha lekin gahane girvee rakhane ke baad keval 9 hajaar rupee hi mil paye
 Phoolkumari said that she would collect the rest of the money by doing her wages
 mishan pratishtha ke tahat milegaa puraskaraphulkumari ko ummid he ki 15 agast tak uskaa shauchalay ban jaayegaa
 He believes that if there is lakhs of jewels in the house and there is no toilet in the house then the jewels have no value
 lekin is puure prakaran main pratishtha to sarkaar kii us yojana kii gai jiske tahat kaha jaataa he ki shauchalay banavaane par sarkaar madad karegi agar sarkaar madad karti to aaj phulkumari ko apane gahane girvee na rakhane padate
 But a salute to the government officials who not only want to salute the spirit of Phulakumari now but also reward them for declaring their 'mission Reputation' as successful

 Aamir Khan's late-year film 'dhoom 3' has grossed a total of Rs 280 crore at the domestic box office
 mudra ke lihaaj se yah ab tak kii sabase safal hindi film he
 And if 'PK' overtakes it, it will become the number one film

 There is also speculation that 'PK' will get more benefits due to the opposition and controversy of Hindu organizations
 film kaa alag hi kism kaa prachaar ho rahaa he or iske chalate un logon kii utsukata bhi bad rahi he, jo aamtaur par cinemagharon se dur rahete hai
 In such a situation, 'PK' can also start 300 crore club of Hindi films
 'pike' ko is baat kaa bhi phayda mil rahaa he ki uski relies ke do hafte baad tak box offis par or koi badi film nahin aa rahi
 This Friday, Anurag Kashyap's film 'next' has been released

 This announcement was made today after hearing the court for many years on this issue
 court ne tiwari se maamle ko madhyastha ke jariye shantipurna dhang se nipataane ko kaha tha
 Tiwari's announcement was followed by a press conference, in which the Congress leader also said in front of journalists that Rohit Shekhar is my son
 kya vah aapkaa uttaradhikari bhi he, is sawaal par kuch der chuppi ke baad endi tiwari ne teen baar haa kaha
 During this, Rohit Shekhar touched his feet
 sir jhukaakar pranaam kiya
 Tiwari rubbed Rohit's cheek and said, i want Rohit to be with me
 patrakaron se baat karte hue rohit shekhar ne kaha ki main papa se kal 9 saal baad mila
 He said that if ND Tiwari sincerely honors my mother and me, all is well on my side
 main ek shabd bura nahin chahta unke liye
 The court presented the example before the society, Rohit Shekhar said that he has not spoken to ND Tiwari in detail yet
 unke mutabik, maine unase philhal bas itnaa kaha, ki agar aap mujhe betaa maanate hai to khule man se maniye
 According to Rohit, an example has been presented before the country from our case presented in court
 2008 se chal rahaa tha pitrutv vivadacongress ke varisht netaa narayan dutt tiwari (en

 tiwari) ne rohit shekhar ko apana betaa sweekaar kar liya he
 With this, the paternity case that has been going on since 2008 seems to have been settled
 89 varshiya tiwari ne ek tivi channel se kaha, ‘maine sweekaar kar liya he ki rohit shekhar meraa betaa he
 DNA reports have also proved that he is my biological son

 Many people, even singers, did not realize, as Papon said in a jolt, that this song and music would also bring out a serious and gentle message of cleanliness, a unique opportunity to announce Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Clean India campaign

 Singing in front of a crowd of spectators is really a work of courage, Daler Mehndi is undoubtedly the king of hearts

 He said that according to the World Bank report, about 600 million people in India defecate in the open and this is the biggest reason for the spread of infectious diseases

 In fact, the Chhattisgarh government has proposed construction of four major projects on the Mahanadi, of which only the construction of the Kelo Dam has been approved
 kelo ke alaava chhattisgarh ne perimandih, candula or tendula pariyojnaon ko kendriya jal ayog ke paas bheja he par inke nirmaan ko lekar takneekee salaahkaar samiti se abhi manjuuri nahin mili he
 Regarding them, the Odisha government alleges that the construction work on the Tendula Dam has been done without approval and this will cause water scarcity in Odisha

 At the same time, the Congress is entangled in its factionalism

 Opposition parties allege that the new government has raised the issue of Mahanadi to divert public attention in cases such as the encounter of five tribals in Kandhamal, death of 19 children due to malnutrition in Nagda, chit fund scam
 odisha ke mukhya sachiv aditya padhi ne kaha ki chhattisgarh kii ore se banaae ja rahe bairaj avaidh hai, inkaa nirmaan roka janaa chahie
 He also says that Chhattisgarh did not give any information to Odisha regarding the Mahanadi case
 unke mutabik, in baandhon ke banane se odisha ke liye pani hi nahin bachegaa
 BJD Spokesperson Pratap Kesari Deb says that the new barrage will reduce the flow and may end the usefulness of the Hirakud Dam

 If there is no water in the dam, water will be generated in both cities

 Its direct effect will be seen after the monsoon

 But the work of removing the claim of the BJD of not informing the Odisha government was first done by senior government minister Damodar Raut
 unhone kaha ki 2008 se kelo baandh par kaam chal rahaa he or sarkaar ko maaloom hi nahin, yah baat gale nahin utarati

 In a letter to Prime Minister Modi, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has expressed concern about the approved and proposed irrigation projects in some of its tributaries including seven pick-up wears on Mahanadi
 chhattisgarh kii vrihad, madhyam or choti jal pariyojnaon ko milakar kareeb 17 pariyojnaon kii vajah se mahanadi kaa odisha ke hisse kaa pani kam hua he
 The Government of Odisha has objected to the water agreement between the then Madhya Pradesh and the Government of Odisha and has ruled the projects on the Mahanadi and its tributaries flowing through Chhattisgarh against the rules

 On the other hand, Odisha Chief Secretary Padhi said that a decision will be taken after discussion with the Chief Minister

 The Indian team had lost the Test, however, except for one or two seasons, for the most part of this match, India's bowling seemed heavy and a unilateral victory was visible
 bhartiya dressing room main kisi matam jaisi khamoshi thi
 They had lost the Test in hand, so the fellow players were expressing their anger and daring the team to show their superiority
 abhi do test baaki the
 The captain's warning was, win and show, otherwise i will not fight for you

 He told Kohli that he was also saddened by the defeat and would no longer make old mistakes

 The young boys of the team had now become young men

 Kohli, standing in a ballpark outside the dressing room of Sri Lanka's most dormant ground, is considering the specifics of the battle, on the other hand, a handful of Indian fans are applauding the players after their 117-run win in the Test
 22 saal baad bhartiya team ne srilanka main siries jeet lee he
 Kohli took off his shirt and for a moment thought that he would also wave his shirt in the same way as Saurabh Ganguly took off his shirt after the victory at Lord's in 2002
 lekin kohli ne khud ko roak liya or apni shart va kuch anya nishaniyaan neeche khadey bhartiya prashansakon kii taraf oochaal deen
 While the team players enjoyed a party at the hotel hosted by the team's director Ravi Shastri, Kohli again said, "it should be our habit to win"
 hamen phir number van bananaa he
 "it is now the beginning of the Kohli era, and it will probably be different from the performances of the Indian team in recent times, which have been facing defeat in Test matches on foreign soil
" srilanka ke khilaaf siries main mili jeet pichley chaar varshon main videshi maidan par test siries main milane vaali pehali jeet he
 It is to be seen that the role of the bowlers in this victory has been prominent

 Apart from the changes in bowling at Galle, he understood the pitch and match conditions almost exactly

 Now a new Indian team is standing, showing new confidence

 Ishant and Umesh Yadav have become successful contenders in the matter of fast bowling, while R
 aswin agali pankti ke phiraki gendbaaj ban gaye hai
 This new team is being helped by the new reality that after a long time India has found a captain who is ready to risk winning the Test match by keeping five bowlers in the team
 dressing room kii jaankaree rakhane waalon kaa kahana he ki captain ke bharose ke kaaran hi harbhajan singh or amit mishra jaise varisht khiladinnon ne bhi shandaar pradarshan kiya
 Harbhajan's performance in Galle may not have been impressive, but Mishra did well in spin bowling
 haalanki aswin ne srilanka main 21 wicket lekar main of da siries kaa puraskaar jeet liya lekin mishra ne bhi 30 se kam gendon main ausatan 1 wicket hasil kiya
 Mishra says, "when the captain expresses his confidence in you, you get strength
" ''lekin kohli kii sabase badhibia takat agar kuch he to vah he unka lacheelaapan
 He immediately accepted the mistakes in the Galle defeat
 haalanki unki is baat ko lekar kadi aalochana hui ki unhone stuart binni ko turant bharat se bulaayaa, lekin ve sahi sabit hue
 Rohit Sharma has not been so good at the number three spot, bringing in Ajinkya Rahane
 lekin jab pujaara ne aakhri test main match jitaane vaala shandaar shatak lagaaya to kohli ke ballebaaji kram ne phir se apni lay pakad lee
 India can open with Vijay and Dhawan in four Tests against South Africa
 iske baad pujaara, kohli or rahane kaa number aayega
 If Kohli plays with six batsmen, Rohit will bat at number six
 kohli kehete hai, ''is ballebaaji kram main koi bhi slot atal nahin he
 We will decide the role of the players based on the conditions and the needs of the team
 ''kohli kii team or 2000 main team kii bagdor sanbhaalane vaale saurabh ganguli kii team ke bich tulana karne kaa lobh swaabhaavik he
 Ganguly's team had many legendary players like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, but it is also true that he built a strong team by relying on young players like Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh
 ab kohli ke paas bhi vaisaa hi mauka he
 "I don't think Virat's captaincy should be compared to me or Dravid or Dhoni," says Ganguly
 kohli kaa jajba mujhe diego maradona kii yaad dilaataa he
 "this team is also benefiting from the synergy between Kohli and team director Ravi Shastri
" kohli or unki team ko ab dakshin africa kii siries main agar badi jeet milti he to bharat antarrashtriya cricket council kii ranking main number do ke sthaan par pahunch jayega

 Mahatma Gandhi, who had made a significant contribution in the freedom of the country, used to stay without drinking every single week
 desh kii raajnneeti main badlaav main sirf mahatma gandhi kii soch kii takat kaa hi yogadan nahin tha, balki unki shaareerik takat kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika thi
 Gandhi, who won freedom for the country without a sword and without a gun, was very conscious of his health and fitness
 aap bhi gandhi ji se sehat kii ye 10 sikh le sakate hai
 
 1
 Age increases with non-violence: Mahatma Gandhi believed that non-violence is not only necessary to protect human beings, but renunciation of such ideology also gives life
 aise log shant swabhaav ke hote hai or unamem hisertension va dil kii beemaari jaisi pareshaaniyaan kam hi utpann hoti hai
 People who remain calm also have less desire for cigarettes, alcohol and non-healthy food
 2
 Sleeping early and waking early: Mahatma used to sleep only 4 to 5 hours in Gandhirat
 surya ugane se pehle hi wo bistar chhod dete the
 According to today's lifestyle, 7 to 8 hours of sleep is necessary for the youth
 aise main gandhi ji kii jaldi sone or jaldi uthne kii aadat yuvaaon ke din ko productive bana saktaa he
 3
 vrath rakhane se sudharti he sehat:mahatma gandhimante the ki vrath rakhana sehat ke liye acha hota he
 It clears the stomach and reduces body fat
 ayurveda ke anusaar bhi har vyakti ko saptaah main ek din vrath jarur rakhana chahie
 Gandhi ji fasted for 21 days for the unity of Hindu and Muslim
 4
 Consider your diet: Gandhiji used to say that our body is not dustbin
 isliye kuch pet main na daalen
 Before eating, consider it, consider what you are eating and what the long term effect will be
 5
 Distance from alcohol and tobacco: Mahatma Gandhi used to recommend distance from two things
 sharaab or tambaakoo langs cancer, stroke, hai blad pressure aadi kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 It can also cause diabetes, heart diseases
 6
 Meditation: Mahatma Gandhi often used to mediate
 meditation blad pressure ko niyantrit karata he or stress va avsaad ko control karne main bhi yah kargar he
 7
 sakaaratmak soch:hamaari soch hamaari sehat ko bhi prabhavit karti he
 Mahatma Gandhi used to say that our thinking makes us human
 sakaaratmak soch na keval sehat thik rakhti he, balki yah hamaare skills or kaam karne kii kshamta ko bhi behatar banaati he
 8
 paidal chalem:mahatma gandhiki urja or takat ke peeche unke chalane kii aadat hi sabase badi vajah thi
 Not only does walking increase your stamina, but it also increases your immunity
 9
 Learn to forgive others and yourself: Do not carry a burden on your heart
 mahatma gandhi kehete the ki jo log kamjor hote hai wo kabhi kisi ko maaf nahin karte
 Forgiveness is a sign of your strength
 jab aapke dil or dimag main stress hoga, isse aapaki shaareerik sehat bhi prabhavit hogi
 The habit of forgiveness reduces anger, depression, and fatigue
 10
 Empathy: People who sympathize with others feel better
 dusron ko samajhane main isse aapako madad milti he
 You are less critical and understand how others are feeling

 Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan has told states that many states have cut VAT and sales tax on petrol and diesel
 unhone un rajyon se bhi waite ghataane kii apil kii he, jo philhal zyada waite vasuul rahe hai
 He said that these states should take this step in the interest of common man
 petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane ko lekar unhone kaha ki jaise hi sabhi rajyon ke bich sahmati ban jaaegi, ise jiesti ke tahat laa diya jayega
 In such a situation, it is hoped that in the new year, petrol and diesel can be brought under the purview of GST

 'jharkhand main hemanth sorain kii sarkaar moorkhon se ghiri hui he


' aisa kisi or ne nahin, balki sarkaar main shaamil congress party ke vidhayak keen treepathi ne kaha he
 In fact, there is a clear lack of coordination in the newly formed joint government of Jharkhand
 sarkaar main shaamil sabhi dal apni dafali, apana raag alaap rahe hai
 No one talks about the common program on which the foundation of this government was laid
 sarkaar main shaamil dalon ke netaa jahaan kamai kaa jariya dhundne main lage hai, vahin vipaksh apane satta ke sunahare dinon kii yaadon main khoyaa he
 The account of the work done during the three months of the formation of the government has remained a cipher till now
 itnaa hi nahin, isamen shaamil vibhinn dalon ke bich aapasi talmail kii baari kami dekhi ja rahi he
 While the JMM is busy strengthening its vote bank for the upcoming elections, the Congress is very upset with Chief Minister Hemant Soren's recent statements
 sorain ne centre ke food security bill or bhoomi adhigrahan bill par apni raay rakhi thi, jisamen unhone in donon bilon kii kamiyon kaa zikr kiya tha
 Congress state president Sukhdev Bhagat says that all these issues should be raised in the appropriate forum
 mukhyamantri ke in bayanon ke chalate gathbandhan main gatirodh paidaa ho gaya he
 The Bhagat, Hemant government should stand apart from the previous governments in terms of functioning, but this is not happening
 JMM or congress ke bich ke sambandhon main ai talkhi kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki guuruuvaar ko mukhyamantri kii bulaai baithak main ghatak dalon ke sabhi vidhayakon or pradesh adhyakshon ko bhi shaamil hona tha, par isamen ikke-dukke congressi vidhayak hi shaamil hue
 Mostly, the reason for this was attributed to the pre-planned schedule and busyness
 baithak main sarkaar ke ghatak dalon ke bich ke samanvay or sarkaar ke abtak ke kaamkaaj ke alaava saajha program kii pragati kii samiksha honi thi
 While registering his comments on the progress of the Hemant Soren government so far, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Balmuchu said that the government is running the bureaucrats, because it has given people who have been elected ministers for the first time and who There is no experience of running a government
 aisa nahin he ki talkhi sirf sarkaar main shaamil donon bade dalon ke bich hi he
 The RJD in the government also joined the meeting holding a bundle of complaints
 vahiin ek nirdaleey vidhayak anos ekka kaa kahana he ki unhen baithak ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 The governor of the province also exhorted the government in gestures and gestures that it should move forward on the leaks left by them
 in sabake bich janata bechaari kii koun puche? soobe main vikaas thap padaa he, mahangaai aasmaan chhu rahi he
 The Congress, which is putting its back on the implementation of the Right to Education Bill, has failed as its Education Minister in Jharkhand
 ashikshit berozegaar to dur, shikshit berozegaron ko bhi naukari ke laale pade hai
 Every competition since the formation of Jharkhand is in examination controversy
 kisi par sibiai jaanch ho rahi he, to kisi par nigaraanee jaanch
 In one, the High Court had canceled the entire process due to the wrong appointment process
 pradesh main shiksha ko patari main laane ke liye taqariban ek lakh shikshakon kii jarurat he, jabaki tamaam parikshaon ko paas karne ke baad bhi shikshakon kii niyukti prakriya main sthaniyata kaa tota laga diya gaya he
 It is evident that Hemant Soren has been mired in controversies since the formation of the government due to his poor experience
 pehle to JMM ke andar hi mantripad ko lekar kaaphi khinchataan hui, jabaki congress to do maheenon tak mantri pad ke liye yogya ummidavaar hi nahin chun pai, jisaki vajah se in do maheenon main sarkaar ko aadhe-adhure cabinet se kaam chalaanaa padaa
 Independents hoping for a creamy ministerial position to support the government are also angry with their neglect
 aise main haashie main padi sarkaar se janata ke liye raahat kii ummid karnaa bemaani hoga, jab uski jaan khud saansat main he
 The way India was once called the golden bird looted by foreign invaders, something similar is happening with Jharkhand
 fark sirf itnaa he ki is baar luutane vaale chehre apano ke he
 The Nobel Prize-awarded poet Rabindranath Tagore, who showed his unique talent in fields like literature, music, art and education, was a humanist thinker who loved nature
 unka maananaa tha ki chaatro ko prakruti ke sanidhya main shiksha hasil kerani chahie
 Keeping this in mind, he founded Santiniketan
 tagore duniya ke sambhavat: ekmaatr aise kavi hai jinaki rachanaaon ko do deshon ne apana raashtragan banaaya
 From childhood, Rabindranath of acumen had absorbed the country and foreign literature, philosophy, culture etc
 and gave special importance to humanity
 isaki bhalak unki rachanaaon main bhi spasht rup se pradarshit hoti he
 He contributed immensely in the field of literature and was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his work "geetanjali"
 samikshakon ke anusaar unki kriti "gora" kai myanon main adbhut rachana he
 This novel mentions British carpet India
 rashtriyata or maanavtaa kii charchaa ke saath paaramparik hindu samaaj or brahm samaaj par bahes ke saath vibhinn prachlit samasyaon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 According to popular author Maheep Singh, Gora is a masterpiece in which the British couple's children thrive in the Hindu family
 uske mata pita nahin hai or use nahin maaloom he ki vah isai he
 On getting to know about the reality, he gets upset and along with this his idea changes widely
 bharat pakistan vibhaajan par kendrit ‘‘pani or pul ’’ jaisi charchit kahani likhane vaale maheep singh ke anusaar yah apane samay ko darshane vaali behtareen kriti he jisamen dharm, samaaj jaise muddon se zyada maanviya sambandhon par jor diya gaya he
 Gora considers Hindu, Christian etc
 as meaningless and considers human relations to be important
 gurdev sahi myanon main vishwakavi hone kii yogyata rakhte hai
 The humanism of his poetry gave him worldwide recognition
 tagore kii rachanaaen bangla sahitya main nayi bahaar lekar aayi
 He wrote more than a dozen novels
 in rachanaaon main chokher bali, ghare bahire, gora aadi shaamil hai
 In his novels, middle class society has emerged particularly
 rabindranath tagore kii kavitaaon main unki rachanaatmak pratibha mukhar hui he
 In his poems, various topics ranging from nature to spiritualism have been beautifully etched
 sahitya kii shaayad hi koi vidha ho jinamein unki rachana nahin hon
 He introduced his strong writing in all of poetry, songs, story, novels, plays etc
 unki kai kritiyon kaa angreji main bhi anuwaad kiya gaya
 After the English translation, the whole world became aware of his talent
 saat may 1861 ko jodasanko main paidaa hue rabindranath ke naatak bhi anokhe hai
 Those plays are symbolic
 bachapan se hi rabindranath kii vilakshan pratibha kaa abhas logon ko hone laga tha
 He wrote the first poem in just eight years and at the age of 16, his first short story was published
 unhone do hajaar se adhik geeton kii rachana kii
 Rabindra Sangeet has become an integral part of Bangla culture
 hindustani shastreey sangeet se prabhavit unke geet maanviya bhaawanaaon ke vibhinn rang pesh karte hai
 Gurudev also started drawing in later days
 rabindranath ne america, britain, japan, china sahit darjanon deshon kii yatraaen kii thi
 He died on 7 August 1941
 anna hajaare ke sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne anna ke anshan sthal mumbai ke mrdm maidan par logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ne anna or desh kii janata ko dhokhaa diya he
 On the demand of the BJP government to change the bill to Parliament after two-three months, Kejriwal said that the government must change the bill but the bill should be brought and passed in this session
 kejariwal ne sarkaar niyat par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki jab unhen janata kii baat manani hi nahin thi tab unhone saajha samiti kyon banaai
 The government did not meet the assurance given in the committee
 sarkaar ne anna se jo vaada kiya tha usamen se ek bhi baat nahin maani
