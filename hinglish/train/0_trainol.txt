 Ambassador Walid Abu Ali, who is seen in Pakistan along with Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attack, is not returning to Pakistan
 pakistani media main unke waapas aane kii khabaren hai, lekin philistin ne is khabar ko jhuthla diya he
 The Palestinian Foreign Ministry has denied this news
 philistini videsh mantralay ke bayaan ke mutabik, 'pakistan main hamaare rajdoot rahe ali abhi philistin main hi hai or is maamle main hamaara rukh nahin badla he
 We still stick to our last week's stand
 'pakistani media main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki philistin ne hafiz said ke saath najar aane vaale rajdutavalid abu aliko dobaaraa niyukti de di he
 Earlier, Palestine took a stand in favor of India in this matter following India's strict objections
 pakistan ke samachar channel jeeyo news kii ek report main pakistan ulema council (PUC) ke chairman moulana taahir asrafi ke hawaale se daawa kiya gaya he ki valid abu ali ko phir se pakistan bhej diya gaya he
 The report says that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has made Ali a Pak ambassador again
 asrafi ne paak channel par daawa kiya ki unhone philistini raashtrapati or philistin ke mukhya nyaayadhish se apil kii thi ki valid abu ali ko pakistan main phir se tainaat kiya jaae
 He has claimed that his appeal has also been accepted
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya he ki ali buudhvaar ko pakistan aaenge or phir se apana kaamkaaj sanbhaalenge
 The incident happened just before Indian PM Narendra Modi's visit to Palestine
 modi farvari main philistin kii yatra par ja sakate hai
 The Palestinian Embassy in India has also denied being aware of this news
 duutavas kii ore se kaha gaya he, 'pataa nahin, yah khabar kahaan se ai he
 According to our information, Walid Abu Ali is still in Palestine
 'we don't know from where you got this information about Palestine Ambassdor to Pakistan being reinstated
 As per our knowledge he is very much in Palestine as of now: Palestine Embassy in New Delhi to ANI on Pak media's reports on Palestine reinstated its ambassador to Pakistanpic
 twitter
 com / tuzzokc98k — ANI (@ANI) January 7, 2018 Remind you that Ali participated in the rally of Hafiz Saeed's organization dipah-e-pakistan Council in Rawalpindi
 vah hafiz ke saath gale milte or is raily ko sambodhit karte bhi najar aae the
 In this rally, Hafiz had poisoned India, Kulbhushan Jadhav, Kashmir and America
 iske baad bharat ne is maamle ko sheersh str par uthaaya tha
 The Indian Foreign Ministry had reacted strongly to the Palestine government saying that it could not be accepted at any cost
 jiske jawaab main bharat main philistin ke rajdoot adnan abu al hajaa ne kaha tha, 'hamaara desh bharat ke saath apane rishte ko kaaphi ahmiyat detaa he or aatank ke khilaaf ladaai main hameshaa bharat ke saath khadaa rahaa he
 'the Palestinian Ambassador in India said in his clarification,' Our Ambassador did not know Hafiz Saeed
 jab hafiz ne bhaashan diya to rajdoot ne poocha tha ki yah koun he? iske baad hamaare rajdoot kaa bhaashan tha
 Our Ambassador gave a speech and left from there
 'bharat main philistini rajdoot ne kaha tha, 'iske baavjood ham isaki anumati nahin de sakate or isiilie rajdoot ko waapas bulaane kaa faisla le rahe hai
 The rally, convened by Hafiz's organization, was allegedly held in support of the Palestinians' struggle
 uttar pradesh ke firozabad jile main ek gram pradhan samet do logon kii hatya kar di gayi
 Police sources said here on Saturday that late in the district of Gothua village in the district, on Friday night, a person named Devendra killed the village head Satya Prakash (45) with a brick
 unhone bataaya ki jarkhi gaanv main agyaat logon ne apane tubewel ke paas so rahe haakim singh (55) kii goli markar hatya kar di
 The police have registered a case and started proceedings
 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav kaa teesraa charan sapa ke liye sabase mahatvapurn he or akhilesh yadav ke liye sabase badi chunauti sapa ke garh itawa or aasapaas ke zilon ko bachaane kii hogi
 SP rebel candidates are in the fray in many places from this area and bjp's best effort is to demolish the sp's fort
 is baat ko akhilesh acchhee tarah se jaanate hai isliye itawa or mainpuri main jamkar reliyaan kar pasinaa baha rahe hai
 They know that this time it is not easy to compete in the SP stronghold, votes are to be cast in 69 seats in the third phase
 2012 ke chunaavon main 69 siton main sapa kaa pradarshan behtareen rahaa tha or use kul 55 siten mili thim
 At the same time, BSP got 6 seats, BJP 5 and Congress got 2 seats and one seat to independents
 tippaniyan Akhilesh has relied on the new candidates this time by cutting the ticket of many sitting mlas of this area
 aisi hi ek seat he itawa sadar, yahaan se sapa ne kuldeep shantu ko tikat diya he
 The SP has given a ticket to the current MLA Shivpal faction Raghuraj Shakya by 'shunt' and against his cycle, sp's gardener Ashish Rajput has jumped with the plow farmers plowing the Lok Dal
 bataaya jaataa he ki yah shivpal ke behad qareebi hai or vah jeetne se zyaada sapa ko haraane ke liye maidan main utre hai
 There are many other SP rebels who are spoiling the game of SP by either standing on Lok Dal or independents if they are not getting tickets
 udhar bijepi kii puri taiyaari sapa kaa kila dhahaane kii he kyonki 2012 main bijepi kaa sapa ke garh itawa, mainpuri main khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha
 From Rajnath to Uma Bharti, Amit Shah, Swami Prasad Maurya, Keshav Maurya are holding rallies in the sp's stronghold
 unhen pataa he ki unhen mulaayam ke kile main send lagane kaa isse acha mauka nahin milegaa or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone itawa se jeet darz kii thi
 Akhilesh Yadav also wants to win the party from here and give a message to Shivpal faction, but all this land does not look as easy
 akhilesh ke liye ek sher bada fit baithta he 'hamen apano ne lutaa gairon main kahaan dam tha

 ' On the other hand, the entire preparation of the BJP is to demolish the sp's fort because in 2012, the account of the bjp's SP stronghold Etawah, Mainpuri, was not even opened
 rajnath se lekar uma bharti, amit shah, swami prasad maury, keshav maury sapa ke garh main tabad tod reliyaan kar rahe hai
 He knows that he will not get a better chance of breaking into Mulayam's fort and won the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Etawah
 akhilesh yadav bhi chaahate hai ki vah party ko yahaan se jeeta kar shivpal gut ko ek sandesh den lekin ye sab kuch zamin utana aasaan nahin dikhataa he
 a lion fits very well for Akhilesh 'where did we have the strength in the loots of my own people

 The videos coming from Srinagar are telling how brutally NIT students have been killed
 sarkaron ne to lathicharge ko maamuli bataakar chaatro ko campus ke andar rahane ke naseehat bhare bayaan jari kar diye lekin chaatro kii taraf se jab video baahar aayaa to dekhakar sann rah gaya
 Can any such student be killed? is video ke baad upmukhyamantri nirmal singh ko bhi apane bayaan se palatnaa padaa ki vahaan maamuli lathicharge hua he
 Students say that we do not go out of campus like that because there is no more security outside
 hamen get ke bheetar hi maaraa gaya he
 Many people were happy when police took action at Jawaharlal Nehru University and Hyderabad Central University
 shaayad enaiti ke chaatr bhi khush honge
 They all said that these students come to study or do politics
 police ne jo kiya, thik kiya
 Can the same thing now be said about the students of NIT? It would be unfair to do so with the demands of these students
 enaiti srinagar kii ghatana sabit karti he ki jo samarthak hai unhen bhi police ke dar se chup rahanaa hoga
 They will not even be allowed to question
 vaise poocha janaa chahie ki pakistan kaa jhanda lahraane vaale chaatro ko giraftaar kyon nahin kiya gaya he? kya uske bare main koi cameti jaanch kar rahi he, jis tarah kii jaanch jeenyu main hui thi? in chaatro ko kab giraftaar kiya jayega? police kii lathi khaane vaale enaiti ke ek chaatr ne kaha ki unhone khub virodh kiya lekin ve bhi nahin chaahate ki giraftaar ho kyonki pakistan zindaabad karne vaale bhi chaatr hai or hamaari tarah bachche hai
 Later they will understand themselves
 kai chaatro kii baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki is tarah kii narebaazi yaa takaraav kabhi nahin hua he
 We all have to think about what happened at this time
 sarkaar bataa de ki kya vah chaatro kii in raay se sahamat he? Secularists were abused on social media as soon as the news of lathicharge in Srinagar came
 chand patrakaron ko bhaddi gaali dekar poocha jane laga ki bataao, ab kya kahana he
 Hey brother, what to tell pucho, unase jinaki vahaan sarkaar he
 Are these four journalists also the government, then who is the Chief Minister and who is the Deputy Chief Minister
 bharat ke khilaaf naare lagane vaale chaatro ko giraftaar pidipi-bijepi kii police karegi yaa barkhaa dutt yaa rajdeep saradesai
 Did people close their eyes at all or do they also have panic opening eyes due to fear of these political gangs
 chand logon ko secular bataakar gaaliyaan di jane lagi
 You are also a little foolish
 secular hona hi sanvaidhanik hona he
 Who are abusing those who are secular, who are they abusing? samvidhan ko ? NIT is a member of Union Ministry of Human Resources in Srinagar for 24 hours
 kya ve ab bataa sakate han ki police ne diarector ke aadesh se lathi chalaai yaa rajya sarkaar ke aadesh se
 Media was kept off campus but whats up started rumors that the media used to cover JNU but NIT is not covering the students of Srinagar as they were shouting slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 pathak or darshak ko in afvaahon se satark rahanaa chahie, ek din yahi giroh aapako dharega jab aap kisi mudde ko lekar sawaal uthaayenge
 There will be questions even when heaven will become on earth
 janata kaa reporter ne likhaa he ki esaspi( aparaadh ) ne fasebuk par ek post kiya he ki jammu-kashmir kii police ko rashtrawaad yaa tatasthta par un logon se certificate kii zarurat nahin he jinaki bahaduree keepad tak hi simit rahati he
 The story of the Jammu and Kashmir Police is of sacrifice and courage and has driven the state out of the madness of terrorism
 jis police ko soshal media par ek tabake ne sampradayik or bharat mata virdohi ghoshit kar diya he vahi police kah rahi he ki usne tyaag or saahas ke dam par rajya ko aatankwaad ke paagalpan se baahar nikaala he
 Still the question can be asked to this police that if you are so brave then why surrounded the students and students in lathi and hit them with sticks
 bharat murdaabaad ke naare lagane waalon ko tabhi kyon nahin giraftaar kiya
 Why haven't you arrested yet? chaatro ne hi kaha ki isse pehle campus main kashmiri or gaiyr kashmiri chaatro ke bich takaraav nahin hua
 He says that among non-kashmiri students there are also Muslim students from Kerala, Bihar, Rajasthan and UP who are in tune with the demands of non-kashmiri students
 isliye zaruri he ki chaatro kii maang ko bhi suna janaa chahie or usee par bahes honi chahie
 non-kashmiri students say that they are being threatened to fail, so the campus administration is no longer trusted
 ek chaatr ne kaha ki kashmiri chaatro ko zyaada number milte hai lekin ek ne kaha ki yah baat aam nahin he
 If there is any conflict with a student, then their numbers are reduced, so we are demonstrating with a mask
 phir bhi is bhedbhaav ko ghante bhar main kisi vishay ke number se sabit kiya ja saktaa he ki kya kashmiri chaatro ko zyada number milte hai
 There is a complaint that most of the teachers are from Kashmir
 yah pataa karnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 If this is the case then students have a point
 rashtriya sansthaanon main jab chaatr kai rajyon ke hai to shikshak ek rajya ke kyon hon
 Students want their country transferred to other nits and the examination to be held from April 11 is deferred
 tippaniyan It is expected that the state and the Center will make proper arrangements for the safety of these students
 ye chaatr is sthiti main chaar din baad imtahaan dene kii sthiti main nahin he
 The administration may also think liberally about extending the date
 kam se kam apana daravaaza media ke liye hi khol de taaki chaatr apni baat kah saken or media bhi dekh sake ki sachai kya he
 In the case of JNU, the Finance Minister declared that they have won the first phase of the fight, they should tell what stage the fight has been waged by the students of NIT Srinagar, and how they are going to win
 kya pakistan kaa jhanda lahraane waalon ko giraftaar kar jeetne ja rahe hai yaa enaiti ke chaatro ko vahaan se hataakar kahin or bhejkar jeetne ja rahe hai
 Students also worry that their demands should not be lost in the politicization and communalization of the issue
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay or hyderabad central uniwarsity main jab police ne karrwai kii to kai log khush the
 Perhaps NIT students will also be happy
 in sabakaa kahana tha ki ye chaatr padhai karne aate hai yaa raajnneeti karne
 The police did what was right
 kya ab yahi baat enaiti ke chaatro ke bare main kahi ja sakati he? aisa karnaa in chaatro kii maangon ke saath ninsaphi hogi
 The incident at NIT Srinagar proves that those who are supporters also have to remain silent for fear of the police
 sawaal karne kii ijazat unhen bhi nahin hogi
 By the way, why should the students who wave the flag of Pakistan have not been arrested? Is there any committee investigating him, the kind of investigation done in JNU? When will these students be arrested? a student of the NIT, who eats the police sticks, said that they protested a lot but they also did not want arrest because Pakistan is a student of life and children like us
 baad main ve khud bhi samaj jaaenge
 The interaction of many students showed that no such sloganeering or confrontation has ever occurred
 is vakt kyon hua, ye ham sabhi ko sochna hoga
 Tell the government whether it agrees with these opinions of the students? srinagar main lathicharge kii khabaren aate hi soshal media par secularavaadiyon ko gaaliyaan di jane lageen
 a few journalists began to be asked profanely, tell me what to say
 are bhai, bataanaa kya he
 Ask those who have government there
 kya ye chaar patrkaar bhi sarkaar hai to inamen se mukhyamantri koun he or upmukhyamantri koun he
 The PDP-BJP police will arrest the students shouting slogans against India or Barkha Dutt or Rajdeep Sardesai
 kya logon ne bilkul hi ankhen band kar lee yaa unhen bhi in raajnneetik girohon ke dar se ankhen kholane main ghabrahat hoti he 
 Few people started being abused as secular
 thodi to akal laga len aap bhi
 To be secular is to be constitutional
 jo secular hone ko gaali dete hai wo kisko gaali de rahe hai
 To the constitution? 24 ghante se enaiti srinagar main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke sadsy hai
 Can they now tell whether the police fired sticks on the orders of the director or on the orders of the state government? media ko campus se baahar rakhaa gaya lekin whats ap par afvaahen udayi jane lageen ki media jeenyu main to cover karata tha lekin enaiti srinagar ke chaatro ko cover nahin kar rahaa he kyonki ve bharat mata kii jai ke naare laga rahe the
 Readers and viewers should be cautious of these rumors, one day this gang will beat you when you raise a question about an issue
 sawaal to tab bhi honge jab dharti par swarg ban jayega
 The public reporter wrote that the SSP (crime) has posted a post on Facebook that the Jammu and Kashmir police do not need a certificate on nationalism or neutrality from people whose bravery is confined to the keypad
 jammu-kashmir police kii kahani tyaag or saahas kii he or isane rajya ko aatankwaad ke paagalpan se baahar nikaala he
 The police, which has been declared communal and anti-mother India by a section on social media, is saying that it has taken the state out of the madness of terrorism on the strength of sacrifice and courage
 phir bhi is police se sawaal poocha ja saktaa he ki aap itane bahadur hai to chaatro or chaatraon ko akele main gher kar laathiyon se kyon maaraa
 Why not arrest the slogans of Bharat Murdabad then? abhi tak kyon nahin giraftaar kiya he
 The students said that before this there was no confrontation between the Kashmiri and non-kashmiri students on campus
 unka kahana he ki gair kashmiri chaatro main kerala, bihar, rajasthan or upi ke muslim chaatr bhi hai jo gair kashmiri chaatro kii maangon ke saath hai
 It is therefore important that the students' demand should also be heard and debated on the same
 gair kashmiri chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen fail karaane kii dhamkee di ja rahi he isliye campus prashasan par ab bharosa nahin rahaa
 One student said that Kashmiri students get more numbers but one said that this is not common
 kisi chaatr se anban ho jaati he to unke number kam kar diye jate hai isile ham nakaab lagaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Yet this discrimination can be proved by the number of a subject in an hour whether Kashmiri students get more numbers
 ek shikaayat he ki zyaadaatar shikshak kashmir ke hai
 It is also not difficult to find out
 agar aisa he to chaatro kii baat main dam he
 In national institutions, when the students belong to many states, why should the teachers belong to one state
 chaatr chaahate hai ki unka tabadalaa desh anya enaiti main kar diya jaae or 11 april se hone vaale imtahaan ko taala jaae
 The comments ummid he rajya or centre in chaatro kii suraksha kaa uchit prabandh karegaa
 This student is not in a position to give examination after four days in this situation
 prashasan taarikh badhaane ke bare main bhi udaartaapurvak soch saktaa he
 At least open your door to the media so that the students can speak and the media can see what the truth is
 jeenyu ke maamle main vitt mantri ne elaan kar diya ki ladaai kaa pehla charan ve jeet gaye hai, unhen bataanaa chahie ki enaiti srinagar ke chaatro ne jo ladaai chhedi he wo kis charan main aata he or wo kis tarah se jeetne ja rahe hai
 Are you going to win by arresting those who hoist the flag of Pakistan or send the students of NIT from there and win it elsewhere
 chaatro ko yah bhi chintaa he ki kahin aisa na ho ki unki maangen is masale ke raajnneetikaran or sampradayikaran main kho jaaen

 In his 32-minute speech on the second day of bjp's national executive in Kozhikode, Kerala, the PM spoke only for 15 minutes on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism
 isamen ek nai baat yah thi ki unhone pakistan ke avam se samvaad karne kii koshish kii
 Made elaborate statements on poverty, illiteracy, unemployment
 jabaki isse pehle hi piem modi nai dilli main teenon sena pramukhon se mili the to ummid thi ki modi pakistan ke khilaaf kuch sakht bayaan denge
 but that did not happen
 modi ne kaha ki 'pakistan kii avam se kahana chahta hum ki aapaki sarkaar aapako gumraah karne ke liye hindustan se 1000 saal tak ladane kii baat karti he
 i am ready to fight
 aao ladate hai
 
 
 See who ends the poverty of his country first? Who ends unemployment? See who can overcome illiteracy first
 aao navjaat shishuon ko bachaane kii ladaai laden
 The PM spoke directly to the people of Pakistan and tried to give a generous response to the Uri attack
 shaayad wo yah dikhaanaa chaahate hon ki wo anya netaaon se alag hai
 Amit Shah showed strong message to Pakistan on the third day of bjp's national executive party party Amit Shah in Talkh Tevarkozhikode
 unhone kaha, 'padosi ne hamaare upar lambii ladaai thopi he lekin vah ise parinaam na samajhe, udi to ek padaav he, ladaai kitni bhi lambii ho, vijay hamaari sena kii hi hogi
 This means that the party president's attitude towards the war against Pakistan was seen
 shah ne pakistan ko nishaanaa banaate hue or use gherne ke liye modi sarkaar ke kootnithik prayaason kaa samarthan bhi kiya
 He said that the party feels the anger prevailing in the country
 shah ne kaha, 'aatankwaad kisi desh kii sarkari niti kaa hissaa ban jaae to vah yuddh aparaadh se kam nahin hota he
 This is happening in Pakistan
 bijepi sajeeshkartaaon ke khilaaf janata ke aakrosh ko mahasoos karti he
 We will give a befitting reply to this
 ' is tarah shah ne desh kii janata ke bich vyaapt gusse ko party kii ore se jagajaahir kiya
 India and Pakistan have their eyes on the diplomatic chasom-wise Evening Minister Sushma Swaraj's statement to the United Nations
 ummid he ki sushamaa kaa bayaan sarkaar or party ke rukh se thodaa hatakar hoga or vahaan ladaai kootnithik morche par ladi jaani he
 Since the Uri attack, Pakistan has been clarifying itself on international forums for not being responsible for this act
 isi kram main navaj sharif ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main jammu-kashmir kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 The Pakistani Prime Minister described terrorist Burhan Wani who was killed in Kashmir as peace loving
 sushamaa kii ore se sharif ke is bayaan kaa yuan ke manch se hi karaara jawaab die jane kii ummid he
 The Indian Foreign Ministry has said that India has every right to reply
 pakistan koatankwadpaida karne vaala or aatankwaadi desh kaha ja saktaa he
 He can be described as a war criminal by using terrorism as a weapon
 yani bharat vaishvik manch ke jariye pakistan ko duniyabar main alag-thalag karne kii kootneeti par bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 Relations between India and Pakistan are deteriorating after the Shastri chatter after the Dhuluri attack
 bharat sarkaar hafte bhar baad bhi aatankiyon ke khilaaf thos karrwai nahin kar pai he
 In such a situation, the time of Lal Bahadur Shastri, former Prime Minister of the country, gets refreshed in the mind of the countrymen
 51 saal pehle jab pakistan ne bharat kii dharti par kabje kii sochi thi to kaise us vakt piem rahe shastri ne pakistan ko dhul chataa di thi
 The world still salutes Shastri for his strong intentions and big decisions
 saal 1965 ke daur main padosi mulk ne 3-3 barsarhad langhaneki koshish kii thi
 Shastri tried to ignore this Pakistan action twice but his patience was answered for the third time
 unhone jammu-kashmir hi nahin, punjab se lekar rajasthan kii seemaa pakistan main daakhil hone kii ijaajat bhartiya sena ko de di
 It was difficult for the Pakistani army to see the occupation of Kashmir and save Lahore and Sialkot
 aakhirkaar yuan ko dakhal dena or sijafire kaa elaan kiya gaya
 When Indira broke Pakistan, people are remembering former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who fought a historic war against Pakistan in 1971, in this fragile atmosphere created after the Kamrauri attack
 1971 main ek baar aisa vakt aayaa jab bharat ke purv main based pakistan ke us hisse main, jise ab bangladesh kaha jaataa he, aisa kuch ho rahaa tha jiskaa sidhaa asar bharat par pad rahaa tha
 At that time in April, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in a big meeting, told the Army Chief of the country, that Pakistan should fight to teach a lesson
 unhen isaki parvaah nahin
 By December, Pakistan created an atmosphere of war and made the mistake of bombing some cities in India
 hamale kii khabar milte hi indira gandhi ne pakistan ko jawaab dene kii ranneeti par kaam shuru kar diya
 The next day the Indian army attacked the Pakistani soldiers
 10 dinon ke bheetar pakistani fouj ghutane techne ko majaboor ho gai
 Even after India won this battle, Indira announced to recognize Bangladesh as a separate country

 com / vv9sccvh5n— Michael Kronenberg (@mwkronenberg)january 4, 2019view this post on instagramit is with great sadness to report that one of our long-time clients of 16 years, Richard Marks, has suddenly and unexpectedly passed away on New Year's Day in New York
 i am nearly at a loss for words
 Richard began with State of the Heart Fitness back in 2005 and had been a loyal client ever since
 He was religious about his twice a week sessions, but for the past 3 months, he and Barbara were in Paris to visit friends, but also in New York, where they had an apartment
 Both from New York, originally, they would usually spend this time of the year back in NY for a few months
 Just last week Richard texted me that he was looking forward to being back and he wanted to resume his sessions starting on Monday January 21st
 i told him i couldn't wait to see him because i always loved our conversations, laughter and typical back n' forth banter
 Richard, simply, was an amazing man
 Very quiet and modest in many ways
 
 
 yet, chances are, you have all seen some of his work as an Academy Award nominated film editor
 Some of his classic films are Terms of Endearment, Apocalypse Now, and As Good As It Gets
 
 
 just to name a few
 I'm just in shock and the tears are there
 The picture of he and i at the top of this email was back in September before he left
 It is the ONLY picture i ever took of us in all of those years
 Why this time? Why now? Did i know on something on some level? i will cherish this picture forever
 As you can see
 
 
 we were laughing like always
 I'm sure i had probably just sang him a song
 Ha! He loved (NOT) when i sang
 Actually he'd say he didn't like my singing but i know he really did so i sang as much as i could
 😜 Richard
 
 
 i will miss you terribly and i know Barbara and your family will too
 
 
 and all of your friends
 You will never be forgotten
 Thank you for letting me be a part of your life and for being a part of mine
 i am a better person because of you
 i will keep your time of 11:00 am open on Monday, January 21st in honor of you
 RIP, sweet man

 unhone ek dashak se zyada samay tak usiele main editing sikhaaya
 He is survived by his wife Barbara and daughter Leslie
 naukari ho yaa bijness, safalataa ke liye kuch skill jaruri hote hai
 Let us tell you about some things that are the hallmark of every successful professional
 
 
 samvaad kshamta Communication capability is essential for success in every job
 kisi se saamne apni baat sahi or spasht tareeke se rakhane vaale log hi gambhirtha se liye jate hai
 In such a situation you will be able to instill confidence in people sampark bananaa Networking is a must in any career
 logon se alag-thalag rahane se kai maukon se chook jate hai
 In today's time, it is necessary to have a strong contact network to succeed
 faisle lene kii kshamta As you progress, the burden of decisions also increases on you
 kariyar ke alag-alag mode par aapako aise sthitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he jahaan aapako ahm faisle lene padenge, bhale hi vah aapaki company se jude ranneetik faisle hon yaa phir aapke kariyar se jude faisle
 These decisions will determine the direction of your success
 tippaniyan leadership ability acchhee leadership skill ke bina safalataa kii seedhiyaan chadhana sambhav nahin he
 Leadership ability does not just mean becoming a boss but also taking responsibility and working in coordination with others
 har koi netritv kshamta ke saath paidaa nahin hota lekin ise siikhaa jarur ja saktaa he
 Balance of work and life kaam hi puja he
 
 
 But at all times you cannot be engaged in worship
 safal log apni work or personal life main ek santulan banaakar chalate hai
 Taking a break at the right time from work, giving time at home and enjoying the important moments of life is also important because it gives you the energy to do good work

 netritv kshamta It is not possible to climb success stairs without a good leadership skill
 netritv kshamta kaa matlab keval bos bananaa nahin he balki jimmedaari uthaanaa or dusron ke saath samanvay banaakar kaam karnaa bhi he
 Not everyone is born with leadership ability but it can be learned
 kaam or jindagi kaa santulan Work is worship
 
 
 lekin har vakt puja main hi to nahin lag sakate
 Successful people strike a balance in their work and personal life
 kaam se sahi samay par brake lenaa, ghar main samay dena or jivan ke ahm palon kaa anand lenaa bhi jaruri he kyonki yahi aapako acha kaam karne kii urja detaa he
 Balance of work and life kaam hi puja he

 safal log apni work or personal life main ek santulan banaakar chalate hai

 'andher nagari chaupat raja, take ser bhaaji take ser khaja', sirf ek din main banaras ke dashashwamedh ghat par baithkar bhaaratendu harishchandra ne yah naatak likh diya tha
 This drama of 1881 returned to Bharatendu ji's own college in 2017
 bhaaratendu ji ne ek skool kii sthapana kii thi, jo aage chal kar college main bana or aajkal chal to rahaa he magar aage nahin chal paa rahaa he
 We pride our language only for rioting, not for institution
 sanstha banane ke liye karte to aaj bhaaratendu ji ke banaae college kii aisi haalat na hoti
 This is the 12th issue of the University Series
 banaras main sab biechayu nahin hota he
 Mahatma Gandhi is Kashi Vidyapeeth, Sampurnanand is Sanskrit University
 banaras zile main paanch uniwarsity hai
 There are eight government colleges in the district
 college kaa haal bhi janenge magar bhaaratendu ji ke bare main thodaa jaan lete hai
 There were only two Harishchandra in Benaras
 ek raja harishchandra or duusare bhaaratendu harishchandra
 Bharatendu lived a mere 34 years, 3 months
 itane kam samay main bhi unhone hindi ko jeene ke liye kai sadiyaan de deen
 Wrote some amazing plays
 bharat durdasha, nil devi, andher nagari, vishasya vishamaushadham, prem jogini, nij bhashaa unnati ahai, sab unnati ko mul
 It is said by them that the development of language itself can open all avenues for development
 magar ab to pragati, unnati or tarakkee sab vikaas main samahit ho chuke hai
 Today, the foundation of what you read in Hindi story poetry was laid by Bharatendu Harishchand
 patrakarita ke zarie samaaj ko badalane kaa sapana, barabari ke liye haq maangati striyaan, ye sab bhaaratendu harishchandra ne apane chote se jivan main hamen diya he
 The city of Andher had not been conceived by Bharatendu ji just for the British Raj, if it had happened, this idiom would have died after August 15, 1947; yah naatak kamaal kaa he
 In one line of this is' Churan Khawai editor Jat, whose stomach is not digestible, Churan Saheb who eats people, the entire Hindus would have been digested chuuran police vaale khate, sab kanoon hajam kar jate'
 So avoid the thunder of power that is digging you
 aaj bharat kii uniwarsity kii haalat dekhie, yah duniya kaa akelaa aisa desh hoga ki jisaki kaksha main guru nahin he, phir bhi vahaan aane vaale chaatro ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran hajam karavaaya ja rahaa he
 'roahu sub millikai matu bharat bhai, haha! Bharat plight is not to be seen, o people of India, Indians, you all come and weep together because i cannot see the plight of India
 yahi matlab he unki is pankti kaa
 Bharatendu ji established a school which later became a college
 us college kii durdasha nahin dekhi ja sakati he, magar uske liye sara bharat milakar nahin roega, bharat kahaan-kahaan ke or kis-kis ke collejon kii durdasha par roega
 You had already seen the condition of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Banaras, today we will also tell the condition of Bharatendu Harishchandra College, Banaras
 mehnat hamaare sahyogi ajay singh kii he, prastuti meri he or drishy nirmaan or saaj-sajja bhartiya vyavastha ke upeksha mantralay kii he
 Looking at colleges, it seems that the Ministry of Human Resource Neglect is running in India, not the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 banaras kaa maidagin ilaaka main he harishchandra degree college
 This college was founded by his trust
 1866 kaa saal tha unhone shiksha ke mahatv ko jan-jan tak pahunchane ke liye chowkhamba sthit makaan main 5 chaatro ko lekar ek paathshaala kii neenv rakhi
 Its name was Chaukhamba School
 1910 tak yah hai skool main badal gaya or 26 november, 1909 ko tatkaaleen leftinent garvanar sar jon hevet ne medagin main nae bhawan kaa shilanyas kiya
 Intermediate classes started here in 1939 and on 4 October 1951, it became a college
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay se yah college sambanddh he
 In 1960, Gorakhpur joined the University
 uske baad yah college purvanchal uniwarsity se judaa hua he
 Nowadays Mahatma Gandhi is associated with Kashi Vidyapeeth
 duniya kaa yah anokhaa college he jise college jaisaa hone kaa bhale hi saubhaahgya na praapt hua he magar chaar-chaar uniwarsity se sambanddh hone kaa saubhaahgya zarur praapt hua he
 Its plight suggests that it is no longer a Maha Vidyalaya, but aha Vidyalaya
 media or raajnneeti or khud banaras ke logon ne banaras ke saath ek anyaay kiya he
 The heritage of the entire city has been reduced to two-four chowk, ghat and golbar
 yahi kaaran he ki ham banaras main biechayu or ghat ke bare main hi zyaada jaanate hai jabaki banaras main iske alaava bhi bahut kuch he
 Ajay Singh has worked hard, so we are also telling comfortably that how we have all comfortably converted higher education into lower education
 8000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai, sochie jis kalege main 8000 chaatr padhate hon us college main aapane kisi netaa ko jaakar photo kheenchaate dekha he, kabhi naam suna he, maine bhi nahin suna tha
 There is so much BHU-BHU that even these 8000 would consider themselves as BHU
 inaki apni koi vyathaa hi nahin he, jaise har vyathaa kii ek hi katha he, biechayu or biechayu ke kaabil vaais chancelar
 However, this college is run in 3 shifts for 8000 students
 yah college subah saadhe saat baje jaagta he, arts, commers, sanins or lau ke chaatro ko padhaakar shaam saadhe saat baje band ho jaataa he
 This college is built in only 2 big land, there are only 40 rooms for 8000 students
 ladke-ladkiyaan bhi der shaam kii shift main hote hai

 tribhuvan narayan singh or brigadier osman jaise shaks is college se padhakar nikle hai
 This college is in the middle of the city, but there is a taxi stand at the gate of the college
 dur-daraaj se aane vaale shavon ko laane vaali gaadiyaan yaheen rukati hai
 The space left within the college is filled with a motorcycle stand
 khel kaa maidan nahin he
 Not only this, there was no toilet for girls in this degree college
 pichley saal jab khushbu singh chaatr sangh kii adhyaksh hui to unhone kaaphi sangharsh ke baad ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay banwaaya
 The problem in India does not get resolved shauchalay kii haalat bahut karaab he
 Some do not even have a door
 saaf-safai nahin hoti he
 At Harishchandra Degree College, the toilet is not only dirty
 balki puure campus main gandagi is tarah bikhri padi he jaise yah yahaan gandagi kii prayogshaala sthapit kii gai ho
 The college does not have sanitation workers
 vigyaapan se saaf to hoga nahin
 The college principal also has answers to the cause of the problem
 jab tak samasya kaa kaaran nahin hota he tab tak samasya kaa prasaaran nahin hota he
 This is the method of government response
 safai karne vaala nahin he magar do baar niyamit safai hoti he
 We understand the helplessness of the principal
 ye samasya unki dein nahin he
 There is a great need of the staff to run this college
 permanent nahin rakh sakate to maheene ke 3000 rupee par karmchaaree rakh liye jate hai
 100 rupees per day i
e
 less than the minimum wage
 bharat kii samasyaon kii ek khubi hoti he
 The responsible is not detected
 shikaar kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Whoever has offended this system, you can find out if you want
 maandey par dhyandey apekshit he
 There is no solution but the principal has reasons for the problem
 bharat ke collejon ko automatic ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Especially those colleges where there is a shortage of 40 to 50 percent teachers
 automatic college us college ko kaha jaae jahaan chaatr admician to legaa magar bina professor, lekturer se padhe hi paas ho jayega
 There should be a movement of fee refund in India by law
 jab professor ne padhaayaa hi nahin to fees kis baat kii lee gai
 Students from India can pay fees for the development of the college by impairing their development
 ab aap agali suchi dekhie or apane bacchon se puuchhiye ki tum jahaan jate hon vahaan koi aata bhi he padhaane ke liye
 The Bharatendu Harishchandra, who gave Hindi to Hindi, is also in a bad condition in the college started from his school
 magar vibhaag ke baahar pattee kii haalat kharaab nahin he
 The department room is left inside the dilapidated college like a river island
 hindi vibhaag ke paas apana pustkaalay nahin he
 The college has a collective library, but the book has not been bought there since time
 librari kii rack par kitaaben to hai magar ab wo course se baahar ho chuki hai
 Even then you say that i do not show positive story
 bataaiye bina teacher, kitaab, librari ke hazaron bachche pard kar paas ho rahe hai, isse badi positive story kya ho sakati he
 Colleges in India are non-teaching teachers' laboratories
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bharat main whatsap uniwarsity zyaada lokapriy he
 a gentleman said that i should stop this series
 boriyat hoti he
 Nobody makes a difference
 ho saktaa he kehane vaale sahi hon par main yahi to dekhnaa chahta hum ki kis-kis ko fark nahin padataa he
 Are you one of those parents or students who do not matter
 sarkari aded college he ye
 The government pays the salaries of teachers, but the college has to develop its own through fees
 fees kam hone ke kaaran bhi baaki vyavasthaaen nahin ho pai hai
 Principal says that there is a lot of craze to get admission in this college
 yahi baat samaj se baahar he ki jahaan teacher na ho, class main pankhe na ho, vahaan admician ke liye craij he yaa chaatro ke paas admician ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Admission is what makes a country great, this slogan should be written
 tippaniyan There is another particularity of India's problems
 inhen dur karne ke naam par kai log aate hai or phir kuch samay baad ve saare log samasya se bahut dur chale jate hai
 The problem stands quietly there
 yahaan se das kimi kii duuri par bhaaratendu trust kii 52 bigha zamin he
 The college asked for permission to run some classes there but did not get permission
 mujhe shaq he ki shashan main baithe logon ne bhaaratendu harishchand se badla liya he ki unhone andher nagari chaupat raja naam kaa naatak kyon likhaa
 They neither write nor the world laughs at the deeds of kings
 vaise akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ne ek karod rupee dene kii manzuri di thi magar college kaagazi khanaapurti nahin kar sakaa or yah fund aaj tak nahin aa sakaa he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, there is a possibility of a riot in politics but neither teachers are named after them nor they are given honorable salary
 is raajnneeti kaa chayan aapane kiya he
 You have seen how bad the condition of Sanskrit education is, now you see the condition of the school college built by Bharatendu Harishchand, the father of modern Hindi
 vaise aaj bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae santhaan kii report pesh kar acha nahin laga
 Has the people of India really sworn that only Hindus and Muslims will work in politics, there will be no talk of teaching and hospital
 kya vaaki aisa he, There were only two Harishchandra in Benaras
 ek raja harishchandra or duusare bhaaratendu harishchandra
 Bharatendu lived a mere 34 years, 3 months
 itane kam samay main bhi unhone hindi ko jeene ke liye kai sadiyaan de deen

 yahi kaaran he ki ham banaras main biechayu or ghat ke bare main hi zyaada jaanate hai jabaki banaras main iske alaava bhi bahut kuch he
 Ajay Singh has worked hard, so we are also telling comfortably that how we have all comfortably converted higher education into lower education
 8000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai, sochie jis kalege main 8000 chaatr padhate hon us college main aapane kisi netaa ko jaakar photo kheenchaate dekha he, kabhi naam suna he, maine bhi nahin suna tha
 There is so much BHU-BHU that even these 8000 would consider themselves as BHU
 inaki apni koi vyathaa hi nahin he, jaise har vyathaa kii ek hi katha he, biechayu or biechayu ke kaabil vaais chancelar
 However, this college is run in 3 shifts for 8000 students
 yah college subah saadhe saat baje jaagta he, arts, commers, sanins or lau ke chaatro ko padhaakar shaam saadhe saat baje band ho jaataa he
 This college is built in only 2 big land, there are only 40 rooms for 8000 students
 ladke-ladkiyaan bhi der shaam kii shift main hote hai

 tribhuvan narayan singh or brigadier osman jaise shaks is college se padhakar nikle hai
 This college is in the middle of the city, but there is a taxi stand at the gate of the college
 dur-daraaj se aane vaale shavon ko laane vaali gaadiyaan yaheen rukati hai
 The space left within the college is filled with a motorcycle stand
 khel kaa maidan nahin he
 Not only this, there was no toilet for girls in this degree college
 pichley saal jab khushbu singh chaatr sangh kii adhyaksh hui to unhone kaaphi sangharsh ke baad ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay banwaaya
 The problem in India does not get resolved shauchalay kii haalat bahut karaab he
 Some do not even have a door
 saaf-safai nahin hoti he
 At Harishchandra Degree College, the toilet is not only dirty
 balki puure campus main gandagi is tarah bikhri padi he jaise yah yahaan gandagi kii prayogshaala sthapit kii gai ho
 The college does not have sanitation workers
 vigyaapan se saaf to hoga nahin
 The college principal also has answers to the cause of the problem
 jab tak samasya kaa kaaran nahin hota he tab tak samasya kaa prasaaran nahin hota he
 This is the method of government response
 safai karne vaala nahin he magar do baar niyamit safai hoti he
 We understand the helplessness of the principal
 ye samasya unki dein nahin he
 There is a great need of the staff to run this college
 permanent nahin rakh sakate to maheene ke 3000 rupee par karmchaaree rakh liye jate hai
 100 rupees per day i
e
 less than the minimum wage
 bharat kii samasyaon kii ek khubi hoti he
 The responsible is not detected
 shikaar kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Whoever has offended this system, you can find out if you want
 maandey par dhyandey apekshit he
 There is no solution but the principal has reasons for the problem
 bharat ke collejon ko automatic ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Especially those colleges where there is a shortage of 40 to 50 percent teachers
 automatic college us college ko kaha jaae jahaan chaatr admician to legaa magar bina professor, lekturer se padhe hi paas ho jayega
 There should be a movement of fee refund in India by law
 jab professor ne padhaayaa hi nahin to fees kis baat kii lee gai
 Students from India can pay fees for the development of the college by impairing their development
 ab aap agali suchi dekhie or apane bacchon se puuchhiye ki tum jahaan jate hon vahaan koi aata bhi he padhaane ke liye
 The Bharatendu Harishchandra, who gave Hindi to Hindi, is also in a bad condition in the college started from his school
 magar vibhaag ke baahar pattee kii haalat kharaab nahin he
 The department room is left inside the dilapidated college like a river island
 hindi vibhaag ke paas apana pustkaalay nahin he
 The college has a collective library, but the book has not been bought there since time
 librari kii rack par kitaaben to hai magar ab wo course se baahar ho chuki hai
 Even then you say that i do not show positive story
 bataaiye bina teacher, kitaab, librari ke hazaron bachche pard kar paas ho rahe hai, isse badi positive story kya ho sakati he
 Colleges in India are non-teaching teachers' laboratories
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bharat main whatsap uniwarsity zyaada lokapriy he
 a gentleman said that i should stop this series
 boriyat hoti he
 Nobody makes a difference
 ho saktaa he kehane vaale sahi hon par main yahi to dekhnaa chahta hum ki kis-kis ko fark nahin padataa he
 Are you one of those parents or students who do not matter
 sarkari aded college he ye
 The government pays the salaries of teachers, but the college has to develop its own through fees
 fees kam hone ke kaaran bhi baaki vyavasthaaen nahin ho pai hai
 Principal says that there is a lot of craze to get admission in this college
 yahi baat samaj se baahar he ki jahaan teacher na ho, class main pankhe na ho, vahaan admician ke liye craij he yaa chaatro ke paas admician ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Admission is what makes a country great, this slogan should be written
 tippaniyan There is another particularity of India's problems
 inhen dur karne ke naam par kai log aate hai or phir kuch samay baad ve saare log samasya se bahut dur chale jate hai
 The problem stands quietly there
 yahaan se das kimi kii duuri par bhaaratendu trust kii 52 bigha zamin he
 The college asked for permission to run some classes there but did not get permission
 mujhe shaq he ki shashan main baithe logon ne bhaaratendu harishchand se badla liya he ki unhone andher nagari chaupat raja naam kaa naatak kyon likhaa
 They neither write nor the world laughs at the deeds of kings
 vaise akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ne ek karod rupee dene kii manzuri di thi magar college kaagazi khanaapurti nahin kar sakaa or yah fund aaj tak nahin aa sakaa he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, there is a possibility of a riot in politics but neither teachers are named after them nor they are given honorable salary
 is raajnneeti kaa chayan aapane kiya he
 You have seen how bad the condition of Sanskrit education is, now you see the condition of the school college built by Bharatendu Harishchand, the father of modern Hindi
 vaise aaj bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae santhaan kii report pesh kar acha nahin laga
 Has the people of India really sworn that only Hindus and Muslims will work in politics, there will be no talk of teaching and hospital
 kya vaaki aisa he, This play is awesome
 isi kii ek pankti main he 'chuuran khaavai editor jaat, jinke pet pachai nahin baat, chuuran sahib log jo khaataa, sara hind hajam kar jaataa
 Churan police accounts, all laws would be digested '
 isliye satta ke us chuuran se bachie jo aapako hajam kar rahaa he
 Today, see the condition of the university of India, it will be the only country in the world that does not have a teacher in its class, yet the students coming there are being made to digest the world guru
 'roahu sab milikai aavhu bharat bhai, haahaa! bharat durdasha na dekhi jaai', he bharat ke log, bharatvasi, tum sab aao, milakar roo kyonki mujhase bharat kii durdasha dekhi nahin ja rahi he
 This is the meaning of their line
 bhaaratendu ji ne ek skool kii sthapana kii jo baad college bana
 The plight of that college cannot be seen, but for that the whole of India will not cry together, India will cry on the plight of the colleges and where
 aapane banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity kaa haal to dekha hi tha, aaj banaras ke bhaaratendu harishchandra college kaa bhi haal bataaenge
 The hard work is done by our colleague Ajay Singh, the presentation is mine and the ministry of visual construction and decoration of the Indian system is neglected
 collejon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bharat varsh main maanav sansaadhan vikaas matraalay nahin, maanav sansaadhan upeksha mantralay chal rahaa he
 Harishchandra Degree College is located in the plain area of banaras
 is college kii sthapana unheen kii trust ne kii thi
 The year of 1866 was to spread the importance of education to the people and laid the foundation of a school with 5 students in a house situated in Chaukhamba
 iskaa naam chowkhamba skool tha
 By 1910 it was converted into a high school and on 26 November 1909 the then Lieutenant Governor Sir John Hivet laid the foundation stone of the new building at Madagin
 1939 main yahaan intermediat kii kakshaen shuru huin or 4 aktubar, 1951 ko yah college ban gaya
 This college is affiliated with Kashi Hindu University
 1960 main gorakhpur vishvavidlaay se jud gaya
 After that this college is associated with Purvanchal University
 aajkal mahatma gandhi kaashi viapeeth se judaa hua he
 This is a unique college in the world, which may not have had the privilege of being like a college but has got the privilege of being associated with four or four universities
 isaki durdasha bataa rahi he ki yah ab maha vidhyalay nahin, ahaa vidhyalay ho gaya he
 The media and politics and the people of Benares themselves have done an injustice to Benaras
 saare shahar kii viraasat ko do-chaar chowk, ghat or golbanr tak main samet diya he
 This is the reason why we know more about BHU and Ghats in Benaras, while in Benares there is much more
 ajay singh ne kaaphi mehnat kii he isliye ham bhi aaraam-aaraam se bataa rahe hai ki kaisen ham sabane aaraam-aaraam se ucch shiksha ko nimna shiksha main badal diya he
 8000 students study here, imagine in the college where 8000 students study, you have seen a leader go and take a photo, ever heard the name, i had not even heard
 itnaa biechayu-biechayu hota he ki ye 8000 bhi khud ko biechayu kaa hi samajhate honge
 He does not have any agony of his own, just as every agony has the same story, capable vice-chancellor of BHU and BHU

 This college wakes up at seven thirty in the morning, teaching students of arts, commerce, science and law and closes at seven and a half in the evening

 Colleges in India should be declared as automatic

 The automatic college should be called the college where the student will take admission but will pass without studying from the professor, lecturer

 When the professor did not teach, what was the fee charged? bharat ke hi chaatr apana deveopment karaab kar, college ke deveopment ke liye fees de sakate hai
 Now look at the next list and ask your children that wherever you go, someone comes to teach

 There are books on the library rack but now they are out of the course

 Tell me, what can be a big positive story without thousands of children of the teacher, book, library and reading

 Is that really so banaras kaa maidagin ilaaka main he harishchandra degree college
 This college was founded by his trust
 1866 kaa saal tha unhone shiksha ke mahatv ko jan-jan tak pahunchane ke liye chowkhamba sthit makaan main 5 chaatro ko lekar ek paathshaala kii neenv rakhi
 Its name was Chaukhamba School
 1910 tak yah hai skool main badal gaya or 26 november, 1909 ko tatkaaleen leftinent garvanar sar jon hevet ne medagin main nae bhawan kaa shilanyas kiya
 Intermediate classes started here in 1939 and on 4 October 1951, it became a college
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay se yah college sambanddh he
 In 1960, Gorakhpur joined the University
 uske baad yah college purvanchal uniwarsity se judaa hua he
 Nowadays Mahatma Gandhi is associated with Kashi Vidyapeeth
 duniya kaa yah anokhaa college he jise college jaisaa hone kaa bhale hi saubhaahgya na praapt hua he magar chaar-chaar uniwarsity se sambanddh hone kaa saubhaahgya zarur praapt hua he
 Its plight suggests that it is no longer a Maha Vidyalaya, but aha Vidyalaya
 media or raajnneeti or khud banaras ke logon ne banaras ke saath ek anyaay kiya he
 The heritage of the entire city has been reduced to two-four chowk, ghat and golbar
 yahi kaaran he ki ham banaras main biechayu or ghat ke bare main hi zyaada jaanate hai jabaki banaras main iske alaava bhi bahut kuch he
 Ajay Singh has worked hard, so we are also telling comfortably that how we have all comfortably converted higher education into lower education
 8000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai, sochie jis kalege main 8000 chaatr padhate hon us college main aapane kisi netaa ko jaakar photo kheenchaate dekha he, kabhi naam suna he, maine bhi nahin suna tha
 There is so much BHU-BHU that even these 8000 would consider themselves as BHU
 inaki apni koi vyathaa hi nahin he, jaise har vyathaa kii ek hi katha he, biechayu or biechayu ke kaabil vaais chancelar
 However, this college is run in 3 shifts for 8000 students
 yah college subah saadhe saat baje jaagta he, arts, commers, sanins or lau ke chaatro ko padhaakar shaam saadhe saat baje band ho jaataa he
 This college is built in only 2 big land, there are only 40 rooms for 8000 students

 bharat ke collejon ko automatic ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Especially those colleges where there is a shortage of 40 to 50 percent teachers
 automatic college us college ko kaha jaae jahaan chaatr admician to legaa magar bina professor, lekturer se padhe hi paas ho jayega
 There should be a movement of fee refund in India by law
 jab professor ne padhaayaa hi nahin to fees kis baat kii lee gai
 Students from India can pay fees for the development of the college by impairing their development
 ab aap agali suchi dekhie or apane bacchon se puuchhiye ki tum jahaan jate hon vahaan koi aata bhi he padhaane ke liye
 The Bharatendu Harishchandra, who gave Hindi to Hindi, is also in a bad condition in the college started from his school
 magar vibhaag ke baahar pattee kii haalat kharaab nahin he
 The department room is left inside the dilapidated college like a river island
 hindi vibhaag ke paas apana pustkaalay nahin he
 The college has a collective library, but the book has not been bought there since time
 librari kii rack par kitaaben to hai magar ab wo course se baahar ho chuki hai
 Even then you say that i do not show positive story
 bataaiye bina teacher, kitaab, librari ke hazaron bachche pard kar paas ho rahe hai, isse badi positive story kya ho sakati he
 Colleges in India are non-teaching teachers' laboratories

 Are you one of those parents or students who do not matter

 The government pays the salaries of teachers, but the college has to develop its own through fees
 fees kam hone ke kaaran bhi baaki vyavasthaaen nahin ho pai hai
 Principal says that there is a lot of craze to get admission in this college
 yahi baat samaj se baahar he ki jahaan teacher na ho, class main pankhe na ho, vahaan admician ke liye craij he yaa chaatro ke paas admician ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Admission is what makes a country great, this slogan should be written
 tippaniyan There is another particularity of India's problems
 inhen dur karne ke naam par kai log aate hai or phir kuch samay baad ve saare log samasya se bahut dur chale jate hai
 The problem stands quietly there
 yahaan se das kimi kii duuri par bhaaratendu trust kii 52 bigha zamin he
 The college asked for permission to run some classes there but did not get permission
 mujhe shaq he ki shashan main baithe logon ne bhaaratendu harishchand se badla liya he ki unhone andher nagari chaupat raja naam kaa naatak kyon likhaa
 They neither write nor the world laughs at the deeds of kings
 vaise akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ne ek karod rupee dene kii manzuri di thi magar college kaagazi khanaapurti nahin kar sakaa or yah fund aaj tak nahin aa sakaa he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, there is a possibility of a riot in politics but neither teachers are named after them nor they are given honorable salary
 is raajnneeti kaa chayan aapane kiya he
 You have seen how bad the condition of Sanskrit education is, now you see the condition of the school college built by Bharatendu Harishchand, the father of modern Hindi
 vaise aaj bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae santhaan kii report pesh kar acha nahin laga
 Has the people of India really sworn that only Hindus and Muslims will work in politics, there will be no talk of teaching and hospital
 kya vaaki aisa he, Its plight suggests that it is no longer a Maha Vidyalaya, but aha Vidyalaya
 media or raajnneeti or khud banaras ke logon ne banaras ke saath ek anyaay kiya he
 The heritage of the entire city has been reduced to two-four chowk, ghat and golbar
 yahi kaaran he ki ham banaras main biechayu or ghat ke bare main hi zyaada jaanate hai jabaki banaras main iske alaava bhi bahut kuch he
 Ajay Singh has worked hard, so we are also telling comfortably that how we have all comfortably converted higher education into lower education
 8000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai, sochie jis kalege main 8000 chaatr padhate hon us college main aapane kisi netaa ko jaakar photo kheenchaate dekha he, kabhi naam suna he, maine bhi nahin suna tha
 There is so much BHU-BHU that even these 8000 would consider themselves as BHU
 inaki apni koi vyathaa hi nahin he, jaise har vyathaa kii ek hi katha he, biechayu or biechayu ke kaabil vaais chancelar
 However, this college is run in 3 shifts for 8000 students
 yah college subah saadhe saat baje jaagta he, arts, commers, sanins or lau ke chaatro ko padhaakar shaam saadhe saat baje band ho jaataa he
 This college is built in only 2 big land, there are only 40 rooms for 8000 students
 ladke-ladkiyaan bhi der shaam kii shift main hote hai

 The space left within the college is filled with a motorcycle stand
 khel kaa maidan nahin he
 Not only this, there was no toilet for girls in this degree college
 pichley saal jab khushbu singh chaatr sangh kii adhyaksh hui to unhone kaaphi sangharsh ke baad ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay banwaaya
 The problem in India does not get resolved shauchalay kii haalat bahut karaab he
 Some do not even have a door
 saaf-safai nahin hoti he
 At Harishchandra Degree College, the toilet is not only dirty
 balki puure campus main gandagi is tarah bikhri padi he jaise yah yahaan gandagi kii prayogshaala sthapit kii gai ho
 The college does not have sanitation workers
 vigyaapan se saaf to hoga nahin
 The college principal also has answers to the cause of the problem
 jab tak samasya kaa kaaran nahin hota he tab tak samasya kaa prasaaran nahin hota he
 This is the method of government response
 safai karne vaala nahin he magar do baar niyamit safai hoti he
 We understand the helplessness of the principal
 ye samasya unki dein nahin he
 There is a great need of the staff to run this college

 aapane dekha ki sanskrit shiksha kii kitni karaab haalat he, ab aap aadhunik hindi ke janak bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae skool college kii haalat dekh lijie
 By the way, today did not like presenting the report of the institute created by Bharatendu Harishchand
 kya bharat kii janata ne vaaki kasam kha lee he ki raajnneeti main sirf hindu-muslim hi chalegaa, padhai-likhaai aspataal kii baat chalegi hi nahin
 Is that really so yah sarkari jawaab kaa tarika he
 Not a scavenger but regular cleaning is done twice
 ham samajhate hai principal sahab kii majaburi
 This problem is not theirs
 is mahavidhyalay ko chalaane ke liye karmchaariyon kii bahut zarurat he
 If you can not maintain permanent, then employees are kept at Rs 3000 per month
 100 rupee pratidin yani neutnam mazaduri se kam par
 India's problems have a quality

 samaadhaan nahin he magar pradhanacharya mahoday ke paas samasya ke kaaran maujuud hai
 Colleges in India should be declared as automatic
 khaskar un collejon ko jahaan 40 se 50 fisadi shikshakon kii kami he
 The automatic college should be called the college where the student will take admission but will pass without studying from the professor, lecturer
 kaayade se bharat main fees vaapasi kaa andolan chalanaa chahie
 When the professor did not teach, what was the fee charged? bharat ke hi chaatr apana deveopment karaab kar, college ke deveopment ke liye fees de sakate hai
 Now look at the next list and ask your children that wherever you go, someone comes to teach

 kya bharat kii janata ne vaaki kasam kha lee he ki raajnneeti main sirf hindu-muslim hi chalegaa, padhai-likhaai aspataal kii baat chalegi hi nahin
 Is that really so bharat ke collejon ko automatic ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Especially those colleges where there is a shortage of 40 to 50 percent teachers
 automatic college us college ko kaha jaae jahaan chaatr admician to legaa magar bina professor, lekturer se padhe hi paas ho jayega
 There should be a movement of fee refund in India by law
 jab professor ne padhaayaa hi nahin to fees kis baat kii lee gai
 Students from India can pay fees for the development of the college by impairing their development
 ab aap agali suchi dekhie or apane bacchon se puuchhiye ki tum jahaan jate hon vahaan koi aata bhi he padhaane ke liye
 The Bharatendu Harishchandra, who gave Hindi to Hindi, is also in a bad condition in the college started from his school
 magar vibhaag ke baahar pattee kii haalat kharaab nahin he

 hindi vibhaag ke paas apana pustkaalay nahin he
 The college has a collective library, but the book has not been bought there since time
 librari kii rack par kitaaben to hai magar ab wo course se baahar ho chuki hai
 Even then you say that i do not show positive story
 bataaiye bina teacher, kitaab, librari ke hazaron bachche pard kar paas ho rahe hai, isse badi positive story kya ho sakati he
 Colleges in India are non-teaching teachers' laboratories

 The government pays the salaries of teachers, but the college has to develop its own through fees
 fees kam hone ke kaaran bhi baaki vyavasthaaen nahin ho pai hai
 Principal says that there is a lot of craze to get admission in this college
 yahi baat samaj se baahar he ki jahaan teacher na ho, class main pankhe na ho, vahaan admician ke liye craij he yaa chaatro ke paas admician ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Admission is what makes a country great, this slogan should be written

 The problem stands quietly there

 The college asked for permission to run some classes there but did not get permission
 mujhe shaq he ki shashan main baithe logon ne bhaaratendu harishchand se badla liya he ki unhone andher nagari chaupat raja naam kaa naatak kyon likhaa
 They neither write nor the world laughs at the deeds of kings

 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, there is a possibility of a riot in politics but neither teachers are named after them nor they are given honorable salary

 You have seen how bad the condition of Sanskrit education is, now you see the condition of the school college built by Bharatendu Harishchand, the father of modern Hindi

 Both Priyanka and Nick are enjoying the scene and are lost in each other
 in donon ke saath main ye pal had se zyada romantic he or ham isaki tarif karne se khud ko roak nahin paa rahe hai
 View this post on Instagram🇮🇹 + ❤️A post shared bynick Jonas (@nickjonas) onjul 6, 2019 at 11:43 am PDT Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are never shy of expressing their love for each other

 Recently Priyanka talked about her life after her marriage to Nick Jonas in her new interview, in which she told how being a husband and having a boyfriend makes a big difference
 aap ek insaan ko apana parivaar chunate ho or uske saath surakshit mahasoos karte ho
 Priyanka had also told that she and Nick are learning something about each other everyday
 nik or priyanka ke projects kii baat karen to priyanka, bollywood main diarector shonali bose kii film da ski ij pink ke saath vaapasi kar rahi hai
 Apart from this, she is working in a Hollywood comedy film with Hollywood star Mindy Kaling
 vahiin nik jonas apni film jumanji: da next level or midway kii relies kii taiyaari kar rahe hai

 huaave kii sabsidari Honor ne haal hi main bharat main Honor 9i smartphone launch kiya he
 It costs Rs 17,999 and its specialty is the 4 cameras given in it
 iske alaava bhi isamen kai khaasiyaten hai, kuch kamiyaan bhi hai
 Is this smartphone the best of this segment? Are there any special advantages of four cameras? Is it Value for Money? In this review we will give you the answer to all similar questions
 dizin or bild qualitisbase pehle ham dizin or bild quality kii baat karenge
 This smartphone is made of body metal
 yah smartphone zyada slim to nahin he, lekin ise hold karnaa aasaan he
 On the top and bottom of the rear panel, you will see antennas lines and not on the side
 rier panel ke top centre main flash lite he jiske thik neeche dual camera modul he
 The fingerprint scanner is given below the camera and at the bottom is the branding and certification of Honor
 Honor 9i ke neeche kii taraf micro yuasabi conector he or isaki dai taraf spikar gril he
 The headphone jack is given on the left side where the microphone is also replaced
 smartphone main kam se kam bejal kaa istemaal kiya gaya he or selfi camera Mi MIX 2 jaise neeche nahin balki upar hi he
 There is also flash next to the camera
 dayee taraf wolum rocker or lock kii he or baanin tar sim trey he
 There is no two opinions about the build quality is solid and you get the feel of a premium smartphone
 rier panel phisalane vaala nahin he, isliye aap ise bina cover ke bhi aasaani se yuj kar sakate hai
 There is already a protection on the display that you can remove if you want
 dizin koi khaas nahin he or isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 Vivo launched the V7 Plus, the design can be said to be similar to that
 displehamane shuru main hi isamen char camere hone kii baat kahi or iske baad hamane kaha ki isaki or bhi khaasiyat he
 Yes yes is smartphone kii duusari badi khaasiyat isamen diya gaya disple he
 It does not have an OLED or AMOLED panel, but only an LCD screen is used
 screen sies 5
 9 and the resolution is full HD (2160X1080)
 iskaa aspect reshyo 18:9 kaa he
 Apart from this, 2
 5D karvd glass lagaaya gaya he
 For almost a week of use, we got its screen bright and also sharp
 sharp hone kii vajah se isamen aap videos or photose dekhengo to shandaar lagegaa
 Honor 9i also has an ambient light sensor and it is also useful
 aap jahaan ise istemaal kar rahe hai vahaan kii raushnee kii sthiti ke aadhaar par isaki disple britaness khud se aidjust hoti he
 Had to select manual several times
 yani yah intellegent to nahin he, lekin yah feechar niraash nahin karata he
 Overall, watching videos in Honor 9i was a great experience and the viewing angle is also good
 chunki bejal kam he or disple zyada he to gaming ke lihaaj se bhi yah badhiya he
 Overall, we can call Honor 9i's display brilliant
 is segment main hamane isaki screen ko behatar paaya he
 The Performance Honor 9i has Huawei's own Krini 659 octacore processor with a speed of 2
 36ghz he
 It has 4GB of RAM and its internal memory is 64GB
 hamane ise kai paimaanon par test kiya he
 As you know, we do not give much priority to the benchmark in our review, because sometimes there is scope for tampering
 ham rivyuu main aapako wo bataate hai jo ek aam yujar smartphone istemaal karne ke baad mahasoos karata he
 It is easy to use and Android 7
 0 nugat par aadhaarik customer yujar interphes EMUI 5
 Carries on 1
 multi tasking karne main aapako kaaphi majaa aayega
 One, its display is great and secondly, the multi-task feature given in it is also amazing
 is range ke duusare smartphone main is tarah kaa feechar kam miltaa he
 We realized that even if you are doing two things simultaneously, like watching youtube in half the screen while using Facebook, you do not lag
 ek ap se duusare ap main janaa smood he or ap swimming kaaphi fast bhi
 Unlocking this phone is even faster
 matlab ye kii isamen diya gaya rier fingerprint scinar company ke daavon par khara utarataa he
 It is late to place the finger on the scanner, before blinking an eyelid your phone will be unlocked
 fingerprint scinar ke kuch or bhi istemaal hai jo ise yuj karnaa aasaan banaate hai
 This smartphone is not for heavy usage, we have played some heavy games in it
 game to chalaa he or hamane khelaa bhi he, lekin lag dekhne ko miltaa he or phone ko slo hota hua aap aasaani se dekh sakate hai
 a lightweight mission game or racing game runs well and has a problem
 acchhee baat ye he ki agar aap dher sara videos dekhte hai or filmein dekhte hai to aapako koi problem nahin aayega
 Also because its screen is amazing and there is no drop in its performance by playing videos
 gaming ke dauraan bydaree teji se down hoti he, isolie aap iskaa dhyaan rakhen
 Overall, this smartphone is great for everyday use and if you are not fond of heavy gaming and heavy applications around the world, then Honor 9i will not disappoint you at all
 camerpub baat Honor 9i ke sabase badi khaasiyat kii
 This is probably the world's first smartphone of this price segment with four cameras
 do rier camere jabaki do selfi ke liye
 Now let's talk about the advantages of these cameras in the use of deli
 becoground bler karke photo clic karne delaar kii khaasiyat thi, lekin ab nahin rahi kyonki ab zyadakar smartphone ye feechar dene lage hai
 Similarly , due to the dual camera in this smartphone, you can click the photo after blurring the background
 lekin ab Honor 9i se selfi bhi becoground bler karke clic kar sakate hai jo acchhee baat he
 Bokeh effect / portrait mode or background blur you can say whatever you want
 is tarah kii tasviir clic karke process hone main yah smartphone thodaa time lagaataa he
 The person in front of you can tell you that the photo is taking so long to click
 darasal photo kaa becoground bler karne main ise thodaa time lagata he
 Obviously you will not like it
 lekin becogrount achche se bler karata he
 If the camera was given to do photography just by blurring the background, then the thing was different
 lekin camera kaa istemaal aam tasviren clic karne ke liye zyada karte hai aap or isamen bhi yah smartphone khara utarataa he
 But if the light is low then you will be disappointed
 is segment ke hisaab se hamen iskaa overol camera parformens niraashajanak laga he
 It clicks very good pictures in good light
 diteling kii baat karen to wo bhi aapako milti he
 For information, let us know that its rear cameras have two sensors, one is 16 megapixels while the other is 2 megapixels
 aise hi selfi ke liye bhi ek 13 megapixl kaa sensor he, jabaki doosraa 2 megapixl kaa he
 Although both cameras have a single LED flash
 bydaree lineonor 9i main 3,340mah kii bydaree he, lekin isamen yuasabi tip si nahin diya gaya he
 We believe that the company should have given USB Type c in it
 kyonki ye bajet smartphone se thodaa upar ke range kaa he or is segment ke smartfones ab yuasabi tip si kii taraf teji se bad rahe hai

 sirf college hi nahin unhone bataaya ki college ke fest or yahaan tak ki freshars party main bhi wo kabhi apane game ke chalate shaamil nahin ho pain
 Chodamanika was also fond of modeling since school time
 dilli ke narayana ilaake kii rahane vaali manika kii hit 5 feet 9 inch he or skool ke baad unhone college time main bhi modelling kii
 But when he felt that due to modeling, the table was not able to focus completely on tennis, he gave up everything and chose his game and today he played an important role in winning the gold medal while increasing the value of the country in the world

 (input: IANS) Today, the issue of ball tampering is hot on Australian players
 aise maamalon main match referi kii bhoomika bahut ahm hoti he
 In such a situation, it would be very interesting to know about the match referee - this post was created in 1993
 isisi ko ampiron se lagaataar shikaayatein mil rahi thi kii maidan main achche vyavhar kii puri zimmedaari unki hi kyon ho
 So, he created the post of match referee and made him responsible with the captains and umpires for following the ICC code of conduct during the match
 match referi ke penal main 19 purv test khilaadi hai
 It has Hanumant Singh, Gundappa Vishwanath from India
 shuru main mana gaya ki yah pad " khilaadeeyon ke prati hamadardi " ke liye banaaya gaya he magar isisi ne ab faisla kiya he ki agle satr ke liye vah paanch purnakalik match referi kaa panel banayega
 The panel will be selected by ICC President Malcolm Gray, Sunil Gavaskar and Sri Lanka's Ranjan Madugalle
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki dakshin africa main denis kaa ravaiya sakht referi ke rup main unke chayan ko bal pradaan karne ke liye tha
 After the match fixing episode, the ICC has tried to show that she acts more professionally
 usne pramukh penlon main anglo-austrilord daayre se bahaar ke khilaadiyon ko bhi shaamil karnaa shuru kiya he
 Gavaskar, for example, is the chairman of the committee on technical aspects of sports
 pichley saal isisi ne niyamavali main "khel bhaavana " sambandhit anuchhed bhi joda
 This puts the responsibility of the courtly conduct on the field
 june se apni vaarshik aamasabha ke baad isisi ne galat vyavhar par ankush lagane kii ghoshnaa kii
 The match referee was asked to be strict
 do maheene pehle usne ek nayaa logo dhaaran kiya
 Today, this world institution faces the challenge of breaking down or becoming irrelevant
 yah lekh india today ke 5 disambar 2001 ke ank main ' dakshin africa main vivaad, jang cricket kii', sheershak se chhapi aavaran katha se liya gaya he

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself raised this issue
 ab pradhanmantri narendra modi kii cabinet ne isko lekar faisla kiya

 Even if it becomes a corridor, it does not mean that the ground reality has changed then it will change
 jab tak ki pakistan sangrakshit aatankwaad puri tareeke se band naa ho jaae
 Sushma has clearly stated that it is quite clear, terrorism and dialogue cannot go hand in hand

 hamaare kuch or bhi netaa hai, jo karachi ke saath kahin or se bhi ladanaa chaahate hai
 There is an old saying that jaggery is eaten but it is avoided by dumpling
 ye kahawat aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood azhar ko lekar sanyukt raashtra ke ravaie par puri tarah feet baith rahi he
 18 years ago, in 2001, the United Nations called the jaish-e-mohammed a terrorist organization
 magar usee sanghathan ke mukhibia masood azhar ko wo aatankwaadi nahin maanata
 Do you know why? Because China does not want to
 ab sawaal ye he ki china aisa kyon nahin chahta? haalanki bihi china pulavama hamale ke baad bharat ke saath bhi khadaa dikhaai de rahaa he
 Kandhar hijacking was done only for his release
 aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad kaa gathan sirf bharat kii tabaahi ke liye hua
 The Jammu and Kashmir Secretariat was attacked
 phir jammu-kashmir vidhansabha par hamalaa hua
 Akshardham temple was attacked in Gandhinagar, Gujarat
 loktantr kii dahleez yani sansad bhawan par aatanki hamalaa hua
 The attack on the Pathankot airbase was carried out and now the CRPF convoy was attacked in Pulwama
 pichley 19 saalon main hindustan main hue 20 se zyada aatanki hamalon kaa gunahagaar, saikadon begunaahon kaa qaatil or duniya ke sabase ghaagh aatankwaadiyon main se ek he masood azhar
 The same Masood Azhar, whose organization jaish-e-mohammed was declared a terrorist organization by the United Nations in 2001, 18 years ago
 magar kamaal dekhie ki vahi sanyukt raashtra 18 saal baad bhi ye faisla nahin kar paa rahaa he ki jiskaa sanghathan aatankwaadi sanghathan he, us sanghathan ke mukhiya ko wo aatankwaadi qaraar de yaa naa de?he naa kamaal kii baat ki sanghathan to khooni he, par usee sanghathan ke mukhiya ko kaatil qaraar nahin de sakate
 Because the whole world involved in the United Nations is on one side and China on the other
 china nahin chahta isliye masood azhar aatankwaadi nahin he
 If anyone has made India cry for the most blood for the last two decades, then it is this person
 pichley do dashakon se agar kisi ne hindustan ke khilaaf sabase zyaada saazishen rachi hai, to wo yahi naam he or pichley do dashakon main agar kisi ne hindustan ko sabase zyaada zakhm die hai, to wo yahi cheharaa he
 But despite this, he is not only roaming the terrorists' pasture in Pakistan, but is also continuously spewing poison in the ancestral home of China
 ab ise aap hindustan ke khilaaf china kii kootnithik saazish kahen, pakistan se uski dosti kaa sila yaa phir hindustan ko halke main lene kii galati
 China has repeatedly expressed its opinion in the name of this kingpin of the terrorists in the United Nations, and has shown the double trick on the issue of terrorism
 phir chaahe is chaal se hindustan lahooluhaan hi kyon naa hota rahe
 In fact, Hindustan, along with several proofs against Masood Azhar, requested the UN to declare him a terrorist
 lekin china ne naa sirf use aatankwaadi maanane se inkaar kar diya, balki ye bhi kaha ki kisi par yun hi koi tag chaspa karne main aisi jaldbaazi thik nahin
 China says that India's claim should be investigated first
 sitam dekhie ki jis masood azhar ko aatankwaadi qaraar die jane ko lekar yuano main ye maathapai kaa daur chalaa, usee masood azhar ke sanghathan yani jaish-e-mohammad ko 15 mulkon vaali suraksha parishad pehle hi aatankwaadi sanghathan qaraar de chuki he
 In such a situation, the question arises that what is the meaning of this move of China? After all, how did such a dreaded terrorist become the star of his eyes? And after all, why is China willing to buy angry with India even with such tricks? purvi ukraine ke donetsk main lift main chipa kar rakhe gaye ek bam ke fatne se rus samarthak vidrohiyon ke sena pramukh arseni pawalov kii maut ho gayi

 Pakistan's economy has been going through a severe debt crisis for the past one year
 is karj sankat se use baahar nikaalane ke liye antarrashtriya mudra kosh (imef) pakistan sarkaar ko nishulk aarthik salaah ke saath-saath ek bade belout package kaa praavdhaan kar sakati he
 But Prime Minister Imran Khan is preparing to avert the debt crisis by taking huge loans from friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, using the 20-20 strategy of cricket to bring the economy back on track
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad apane pehle riyaad daure par imran khan 6 billian dollar lekar aae or ab saudi arab ke prince salmaan ne pakistan ko atirikt 20 billian dollar kii rakam bataur karj dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Apart from this, Imran Khan has taken confidential loan from UAE government and this amount of loan is not being disclosed
 iske alaava pakistan sarkaar apane karj sankat se nikalne ke liye china sarkaar se bhi kuch nae karj kii ummid lagaae baithi he
 Will the new debt that Pakistan is getting from Saudi Arabia in the name of investment will get it out of the economic crisis or will this debt cover the economy of Pakistan in such a trough that it will not be impossible for it to come out? Significantly, this is not the first time that the help of Saudi Arabia is going to cover the future of Pakistan in darkness
 girtaa rupaya-badhati mahangaai, paak kii girti iconomi ko sambhaal paaenge imran?sheet yuddh ke dauraan afghanistan main rus ke prabhaav ko simit karne ke liye bhi saudi arab ne america kii shah par pakistan ko badi aarthik madad pahunchaai
 This help was also given to Pakistan as an economic investment and as a result Pakistan has been suffering for the last four decades
 is nivesh ne pakistan main aatank kii pehali factory sthapit kii or is factory ke pehle siio general jiya-ul-haq the
 So, has Pakistan once again turned to Saudi Arabia to convert this factory of terror into a multinational corporation and now Imran Khan, the first CFO of this MNC, will be made? 
 iskaa sabase bada gavaah khud pakistan he
 Global ratings agency Moody's has been warning Pakistan to avoid getting into debt crisis for more than a year

 About 78 on the Government of Pakistan
 46 billian dollar kaa bahya karj he
 This debt is 28 of Pakistan's GDP
 3 fisadi he
 At the same time, the total external debt on Pakistan as of December 2018 is 99 billion dollars, which is 35 of its GDP
 8 fisadi he
 Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves are making this debt more dangerous because it has only 8 in foreign currency
 2 billian dollar kii rakam he
 Apart from this, the current account deficit of the Government of Pakistan is also at the level of about 8 billion dollars in the current financial year
 in aankadon se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pakistan karj ke kis time bam par baitha hua he
 Imran is right, but India is not just a fool for PAK but thinking of nuclear war, amidst this economic situation, there is a new crisis of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in front of Pakistan government
 china ke saath hue samjhaute ke mutabik 2020 se pakistan sarkaar ko project main apane hisse kaa nivesh karnaa he or china se liye gaye karj kaa byaaj bhi adaa karnaa he
 Imran Khan has visited Beijing in view of the acute debt crisis
 jaahir he china se karj main kisi raahat ke evaj main pakistan ko is coridor main china ke adhikaron main ijapha karne kaa ekmaatr vikalp he
 India will stand with Iran again, trade in rupee-riyal is that Pakistan is very important for Saudi Arabia because of Iran's neighbor
 pakistan ko saudi arab se vittiya madad kii shuruyaat 1980 main hui
 Some reasons have contributed to clearing the way for this financial help
 pehla, 1977 main pradhanmantri julfikaar ali bhutto kaa takhtapalat karte hue general jiya ul haq kaa satta par kabiz hona
 After this, the importance of Pakistan became very important for Saudi Arabia as well as America because of the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 and the Soviet Union's occupation of Afghanistan in the same year
 6 guna ho jaataa bharat-paak trade, bas aatankwaad se munh mode lete imran!sheet yuddh ke is daur main jahaan america pakistan ko aarthik madad dekar afghanistan main soviet sangh ke prabhaav ko khatm karnaa chahta tha vahiin islamic jagat main apane kattar pratidwandi iran ko shikast dene ke liye saudi arab ne pakistan ko aarthik madad kaa rasta saaf kiya
 Saudi Arabia's investment on American instigation laid the foundation for the first factory of terror in Pakistan, and the terrorism emanating from this factory was used by the US and Soviet Union against Iran
 maujuuda samay main ek baar saudi arab or america ke nishane par iran he
 Where US President Donald Trump has decided to keep away from nuclear technology bypassing former President Barack Obama's treaty with Iran
 vahiin saudi arab islamic jagat main iran ke prabhaav ko simit karne ke liye khud america se newclear technoboogy kii ummid laga rahaa he
 In such a situation, the importance of Pakistan once again is important for both countries
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki karj sankat se pakistan ko baahar nikaalane ke naam par kya imran khan aatank kii multinational company ke siio kii bhoomika adaa karenge
 Will this loan from Saudi Arabia become a means to protect American and Saudi interests with itself as before
 aisa hua to karj sankat se ladaai kii aad main pakistan main aatank kaa nayaa adhyay judega or isse ubarna uske liye naammumkin hoga

 People were surprised to know this secret of Draupadi, people named by the letter Pandava a wish to live everywhere in life

 The letter a is also sometimes a symbol of aggressive, adventurous

 Even if people treat you with generosity and humility, you do not react very fast
 inaki life par koi or control kare, ye inhen bilkul pasand nahin hota he

 There are many misconceptions in the minds of boys about girls
 log chalati phirti jubaan main kah dete hai ki ladkiyaan to paison par marati hai
 Some say that girls have a habit of making nonsense
 lekin kya aisa sachmuch he? aaie jaanate hai ladakiyon ke bare main wo 8 baaten jo har ladke ko pataa honi chahie
 Girls have a soft mind, they are more sensitive than boys
 chhipakali yaa cochroj se darate hue aapane kai ladakiyon ko dekha hoga
 This behavior is very common in them
 zyaadaatar ladkiyaan ladakon ke mukaable adhik imotional bhi hoti hai
 Every person likes a compliment and girls like it more
 agar ladakiyon kii nai dress yaa nae aabhushan ko lekar tarif karen to unhen bahut acha lagata he
 Being happy and sad on small things is one of their naughty habits
 zyaadaatar ladakiyon ko doston se lambii baatcheet karnaa acha lagata he
 She talks openly to friends because the condition of the girls in her society is that she is not able to tell her husband very often
 hansanaa sabhi ko acha lagata he
 If the boy's sense of humor is good, then the girls like him very much
 ladakiyon ko hansaane ke liye tarah-tarah ke upkram karne vaale ladke unhen bahut bhaate hai
 Love is done by both men, but often the gifts come from the girls
 isliye zyaadaatar ladkiyaan apane dil kii baat kehane main sakuchaati hai or izhaar karne main ladakon se zyada samay lagaati hai
 Vitamin d is no less than a 'boon' for children
 Vitamin d often leads girls to believe that they like to make them up but that is not the case at all
 kisi ko pasand hota he to kisi ko nahin yah puri tarah vyaktigat masalaa he
 If there is love, there is absolutely no hesitation in saying that girls are not less than men in any matter, they are like them
 lekin thodi si alag hoti hai
 There is little difference between their body functions and men's body functioning
 jo baaten ham aapako ladakiyon ke bare main bataane ja rahe hai, jaruri nahin he ki ve satya hon or sabhi ladakiyon par lagu hon phir bhi zyaadaatar ladakiyon par ye baaten lagu hoti hai

 How many firefights do we have to see before bringing a strong law to prevent fire incidents? ' 24 oktober ko maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke aae the nattejebhajapa or shivasena ke bich 50-50 formule par hui anbanmaharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lag gaya he
 Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had recommended imposition of President's rule in the state, which has been approved by the President
 haalanki maharashtra main sarkaar banane kaa vikalp abhi khatm nahin hua he
 For this, political parties have to convince the governor that they have a majority figure
 iske baad bhi rajyapal ke upar yah nirbhar karegaa ki vah sarkaar gathan ke liye rajya se raashtrapati shashan ko hataakar sarkaar banane ke liye amantrit karte hai yaa nahin
 Let me tell you that the bjp-shiv Sena alliance had a clear majority when the results of the Maharashtra assembly elections came on 24 October
 lekin mukhyamantri pad or sarkaar main 50-50 formule par shivasena ke ad jane ke chalate sarkaar kaa gathan nahin ho sakaa
 Despite the invitation of Governor Koshyari to form the government in Maharashtra, the BJP has pulled back
 shivasena tay seemaa main nahin de pai samarthan patrajbaki, shivasena tay samay seemaa main 145 vidhayakon kaa samarthan patr rajyapal ko nahin de pai
 Due to this, the Governor has invited Maharashtra's third largest party NCP to form the government but recommended imposition of President's rule in the state ahead of time
 rajyapal ne kaha ki maharashtra main koi bhi raajnneetik party sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he
 In this case President's rule should be imposed under section 356
 maharashtra main bhale hi raashtrapati shashan lag gaya ho
 But this does not mean that the path of government formation in Maharashtra has been closed
 raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad ab agar congress, bijepi, ensipi or congress main se koi bhi party rajyapal ke paas sarkaar banane ke liye jaati he
 And the party is successful in convincing the governor that they have a majority figure
 aisi sthiti main rajyapal raashtrapati shashan ko khatm karne kii sifarish kar sakate hai
 However, it will be up to the Governor to ask for a letter of support from the party claiming to form the government or to have a parade of mlas in front of them to see the majority figure
 isamen raajnneetik dal rajyapal ko vishwaas dilaane main kaamyaab rahati he
 In such a situation, the Governor will write to the Center that the way out to form a permanent government in the state, President's rule should be removed from the state so that a government can be formed in the state
 raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad ab agar shivasena, congress or ensipi ek mat hote hai or teenon partiyaan milakar sarkaar bananaa chaahati hai to aise main unhen rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ko sthai sarkaar dene kaa vishwaas dilaanaa hoga
 Only then can the Governor take steps towards ending President's rule

 Setting the purpose is necessary
 Rahul Yadav said, 'before doing anything, first of all, decide the purpose like if you want to be a judge then why do you want to be
 sabase pehle lakshya tay karnaa chahie
 i asked a girl why do you want to become a judge, then she said that there are many cases going on in my house and because of this i want to become a judge, so i said that you cannot become a judge
 'dilli ajtak ke antraprenyor summit main rahul yadav ne kaha, 'jaj bananaa ek naukari hasil karnaa hi nahin he
 This affects society a lot
 aapkaa pad ahm hota he, aapkaa ek faisla samaaj par asar daal saktaa he

 haalanki, raashtra ko iskaa laabh mili iske liye jaruri he ki yuva jansankhya ko is drushtikon ke saath taiyaar kiya jaae ki vah desh ke samgr vikaas ke liye apni kshamtaaon kaa bharpoor prayog sake
 The importance of education in this cannot be ignored at all
 yuvavastha ko aksar atyadhik utpaadakta or utsaah kaa daur kaha jaataa he
 This is the period when the youth are moving towards carrying the burden of future responsibilities
 jivan ke taiyaari ke is daur main yuva mastishk na sirf takneekee yaa peshewar kshetron kaa rukh karte hai balki saanskrithik or naitik mulyon ko bhi apane main sametate hai
 This may also include job-related training
 aaj, bharat jis sthiti main he usee sthiti main china 1980 ke dashak main hua karata tha
 He had gained maximum benefits from his youth by putting his population in human resource development
 isi sandarbh main dekhen to neshnal council for aplide iconomic research (ensieiaar) ke neshnal youth readership surveykshan 2009 (enwiares-2009) main paaya gaya he ki sampurna jansankhya ke sandarbh main shikshit bhartiya yuvaaon kii vruddhi dar kaa aankada kaaphi behatar he
 Although 'education for all' is still far-fetched, and it is also directly linked to providing 'books for all', trends suggest that the results of the national resolution are beginning to emerge
 agar doosraa pahalu dekhen to surveykshan main paaya gaya he ki sakshartaa kaa prasar bade str par sthaan (gramin yaa shahari), parivaar kii aay, abhibhavakon kii shiksha kaa str or sakriyata ke darje sareekhe karkon par nirbhar karata he
 Here the divide of urban-rural is visible - the number of youth who have got higher education is more in the cities than in the villages
 yahaan ling sambandhi antar bhi maujuud he
 As a result, policy planners have to address the gaps in the system if they are to achieve the true potential of the young population
 enwiares-2009 ke mutabik 2009 main bharat kii yuva jansankhya (13-35 varsh) kaa aankada 45
 9 crores, 2 according to 2001 census
 05 fisadi kii vaarshik vruddhi kii ore ishaara karata he
 57 of this population by 2020
 4 karod pahunch jane kaa anumaan he
 However, figures alone are not enough
 yah bhartiya yuvaaon ke jivan kii gunvattta he jo desh ko tarakkee kii disha main le jane main ahm bhoomika adaa karegi
 Literacy is directly related to quality which is a major key to socio-economic development
 agar sakshartaa dar kii baat karen to bharat main 1947 main sirf 12 fisadi log hi shikshit the, lekin yah sankhya 2007 main 66 fisadi par pahunch gai
 Although this is a five-fold increase, it is less than the global average of 84 percent
 duusari taraf ashikshit logon kii sankhya bharat main ab bhi sarvaadhik he
 Population of educated youth in India 33 in 2009
 3 karod thi, jo desh kii jansankhya kaa 27
 4% and 73% of the total youth population
 agar kul yuva shikshit jansankhya main se 62 fisadi (20
 66 crores) live in rural areas while the rest (12
 61 karod) shahari ilaakon main rahati he
 Educated urban population in the period 2001 to 20093
 21 fisadi kii dar se badi he jabaki gramin ilaakon main yah 2
 It has been only 11 percent
 haalanki aankadon se yah baat jaahir ho jaati he ki gaanvon main rahane vaale yuvaaon kii sankhya shahari yuvaaon se doguni he
 But in the case of education, the figure goes in favor of cities
 jab tak sarkaar shikshit, pratispardhaa karne waalon kii kam sankhya or skool chhodane waalon ke antaraal ko nahin paategi tab tak 'samgr vikaas' ke lakshya ko hasil karnaa ansabhav hi najar aata he
 Despite entering the seventh decade of independence, the rural population has a very weak presence in the education map
 haalanki sakshartaa ko lekar rajnatik lakshya sirf chote bacchon ko skool pahunchane tak hi he, yah sunishchit karaane ko bahut kam tavajjo di jaati he ki baccha skool kii paaydaan par aage bade or baad main apana college bhi puraa kare
 To change things into reality, it is most important to work on it

 Hear what self proclaimed no
 1 critic and trade analyst Kamaal r Khan has to say
 https: / / t
 co / wrc7moslszshocked https: / / t
 co / 0hdvrquzmc Looking at the recent report on Delhi's traffic system, we find that one crore vehicles have been registered in Delhi so far
 aaj parking dilli kii sabase badi samasyaon main se ek he
 No parking boards are installed in every area of delhi, but many vehicles are parked in front of that board
 kai jagah to sthitiyaan aisi hai ki aadhi sadak tak gadiyaan park kar di gai hai
 Due to this, many times it becomes jam
 dilli ke vyastatam ilaake ke taur par charchit pahadganj jaisi jagahon par to log aadhi sadak parking se hi gher kar rakhte hai
 In such a situation, if you park the car outside the house, be careful
 bahut jald ghar ke baahar gaadi park karne par bhi jurmaana lagane lagegaa
 Such provisions have been made in the new draft policy of the Delhi Government
 jurmaana lagane kaa adhikaar nagar nigam yani sthaneey nikaay ke paas hoga
 Breaking the rules can lead to a fine of up to Rs 2000
 abhi kya he jurmaane kaa praavdhaan?philhal emvi act 1988 section-127 ke tahat pehali barsaarvjanik sthalpar gaadi khadi karne par 100 rupee jurmaana
 At the same time, a fine of Rs 300 will have to be paid
 haalanki sarkaar ke dwaara prastaavit emvi act ke tahat yah raashi 2000 rupee tak karne kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 On this, Bipin Bihari (deputy Mayor, EDMC) says that the corporation will benefit greatly from this
 hamaare parking main log gaadi hi nahin park karte he, magar do hajaar kaa jurmaana lagane par log darane lagenge or gaadi nigam kii parking main hi park hongi
 The people of Delhi are the people of Khafadilly say that it is not right to apply this rule
 itnaa tex to bahut galat he
 More space should be arranged for parking
 haalanki sarkaar kii is baat se kai log khush bhi hai kyonki isse logon keparking sensomen sudhaar aayega
 In Delhi, the number of vehicles is more and parking is less that the number of vehicles in Delhi is more than that of parking
 purvi nagar nigam main sirf 63 parking hai or vahaan 5882 gaadiyaan khadi kii ja sakati hai
 The number of underground and multilevel parking is 39 and 3855 vehicles can be parked there
 vahiin dakshini nagar nigam kii baat kii jaae to 106 jagahon paraparking kii vyavasthaahai
 24500 vehicles can be parked here
 yahaan 7 multi level or bhumigat parking hai
 The Northern Municipal Corporation has 95 parking spots in which 24,600 vehicles can be parked
 8 multileval or bhumigat parking hai or vahaan 6433 gaadiyaan park kii ja sakati hai
 The corporation will decide the parking fee
 It is said that no such rule has been implemented in Delhi yet
 dilli sarkaar ke yatayaat mantri kailash gahalot kehete hai ki shulk tay karne kaa power nigam ke paas he
 The Corporation owns 80 percent of the parking in Delhi
 ve dilli main parking kii vyavastha sudhaarney kii baat kehete hai
 He cites London's parking fee as saying that freebies are not good
 logon main dhire-dhire sudhaar aayega
 They finally say that today there are 1 crore vehicles in Delhi but there is very less parking space
 aise main nigam ko bhi parking kii jagahen bananaa chahie
 In such a situation, it is being hoped that due to this the traffic system will also improve
 balaatkaar koi halkaa aparaadh nahin he
 He differs from other crimes in the sense that he comes across as an attack on the identity of an entire community
 isliye balaatkaar ko lekar kisi bhi tarah kii halki baat kisi samvedansheel aadmi ko chot pahunchaati he
 Politics on rape is also a problem
 durbhaagya se pichley tamaam varshon main yah raajnneeti lagaataar jari he
 Would have been nice if Rahul Gandhi did not give the phrase 'rape in India' like 'make in India'
 yah ek bahut pareshaan karne vaali sachai ko itani sapaat bhashaa main rakhana he ki uski sari bhayavahata khatm ho jaati he
 This is the sad side of this statement
 lekin rahul gandhi ke is bayaan par BJP loksabhaa main jis tarah aakraamak ho uthi, vah ek ashleel drishy jaisaa tha
 This hyper-sensitivity shown about rape would have been seen outside the House, even then it would have made sense, but it is nowhere
 yah sabko maaloom he ki balaatkaar ke aaropee or baad main nichali adaalat dwaara mujrim qaraar die gaye asaram baapu ko kaise bjp-shasit rajyon kii police arase tak giraftaar karne se bhi bachati rahi
 Everyone has also seen how the BJP was so against its MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the main accused in the horrific Unnao scandal
 chunaav jeetne ke baad BJP saansad sakshi maharaj unase milane pahunche
 Congratulations on his birthday last week
 kisi BJP netaa ne apane saansad se nahin poocha ki aise bhayaavah aparaadhon ke aaropee ke saath unki aisi gadhi dosti ke kya myne hai
 How can a party that is liberal with so-called masters like Chinmayananda and Nityananda demonstrate such sensitivity against rape to demand action against Rahul Gandhi on a statement
 
 
 ?balaatkaar ko lekar sansad se sadak tak chal rahe is khel kii hridayaheenata tab kuch or ujagar hoti he, jab ham pate hai ki rahul gandhi ne BJP ke jawaab main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa vah video twit kar diya, jisamen unhone 2014 main dilli ko 'rape capital' bataaya tha
 Will Smriti Irani and Rajnath Singh still use the same language against their Prime Minister as they have done for Rahul Gandhi
 
 
 ? sach to yah he ki unase yah apeksha bhi unke prati anyaay he
 As a matter of fact, Rahul Gandhi's point is tragically true
 yah bahut baar doharaaya ja chukaa tathy he ki desh main har ghante teen balaatkaar hote hai
 But our whole attitude towards fighting this dreadful crime is very superficial
 16 disambar, 2012 ko dilli main nirbhaya ke saath jo samuhik barbarta hui, uske pratyuttar main jaise mahilaon ke saath hone vaali hinsa ko lekar puure desh main ek toofaan uth khadaa hua
 What was the result of this storm? 
 
 ? mahilaon ke prati hinsa se jude kaanoon kuch or sakht ho gaye, balaatkaariyon ko faansee dene kii maang ke sur kuch or oonche ho gaye
 But did this new awareness about resistance to female violence also translate into a new sensitivity towards women's rights
 
 
 ? darasal, balaatkaar akelaa yaa ikharaa aparaadh nahin he - vah langik bhedbhaav ke bahut saare prachhann or pratyaksh roopon kii - jinaki kai baar ham anjaane main or kai baar jaan-boojhkar - andekhi karte hai - paraakaashtha he
 When this culmination comes, we shiver, start agitating, and demand execution, but before that we simply do not quietly tolerate a lot of categories of gender discrimination, prejudice and disharmony, many times happily in them
 Are also included
 yah kis tarah hota he
 
 
 The Many forms of female harassment are found everywhere - in the daily behavior of the family, in the jokes being shared on whatsapp, in films and in web series being made on youtube
 kabhi 'balaatkaar' hamaare gharon main varjit shabd hota tha
 Hearing this word, a frightened shudder raised his head
 yah sahi he ki shabdon ko chipa lene se, dhank dene se, unka istemaal na karne se, sachai khatm nahin ho jaati
 But it is also true that by repeatedly using a word very lightly, we almost eliminate its horrors
 isi tarah yaad kar sakate hai ki lingasuchak bahut sari gaaliyaan hamaare saarvajanik vyavhaar se baahar thim
 They could not be heard in the houses
 lekin haal ke dinon main jo web siries-samskruti viksit hui he, usamen bahut krur or sapaat dhang se in gaaliyon kaa istemaal hota he
 We are slowly getting used to it and our sensitivity to a non-contested form of gender bias has almost zeroed
 aamir khan kii mashhoor film 'thri idiyats' bahut saraahi gai
 In the twenty-first century, films which came as a combination of entertainment and purpose, the name of this film can be taken very high
 lekin film ke ek drishy main nayak ek chitthee main pherbadal karata he or 'chamatkaar' ko 'balaatkaar' or 'dhan' ko 'stan' main badal detaa he
 Within a very good film, it was a dull humor - perhaps a mockery of a sick variety, in which a sexual rot could be easily identified
 lekin puraa desh is par ho-ho karke hansata rahaa
 Apparently, it was the act of denying the word its true intent, which was made possible in the film because it was happening in life
 stri utpeedan ke aise bahut saare rup hamen filmon main hi nahin, jivan main bhi tarah-tarah se dikhte hai
 We keep them and one day we have to fight against rape
 jab is ladaai kaa koi or tareeqa samaj main nahin aata, to faansee-faansee chillane lagate hai
 This may lead to the work of newspapers, TV channels, politicians and so-called social workers, but the fight for equality and dignity of women is ultimately left behind
 is baar bhi yahi ho rahaa he
 Lok Sabha mps are suddenly becoming so sensitive, as if they do not want to hear 'rape in India' at any cost
 agar yah samvedansheeltaa sachhee hoti, to itani vaachaal na hoti - vah kuch guru-gambhir hoti, vah apane bheetar utarkar sochati or samaaj kii us biimaar rag ko pahchaanane kaa ytn karti, jahaan se stri vaimnasy kaa vah silsilaa shuru hota he, jo antat balaatkaar tak pahunch jaataa he
 However, Nitish Kumar, who was freed from the Grand Alliance, now has a challenge to convince the dissidents inside the party
 500 or 1000 ke note band karne ke sarkaar ke faisle ke bachaav main vitt mantri arun jetali khud utar aae hai

 He said that the government's decision to discontinue 500 and 1000 notes is being welcomed everywhere
 is kadam se bharat kii vishwasaneeyata ko madad milegi
 Jaitley said that initially there will be some problems, but in 3-4 weeks the problem will be resolved
 jetali ne 2000ke note main chip kii khabar ko galat bataaya

 The people of 'jain' community in India will also be a minority
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehlecendre sarkaar ne unhen alpsankhyak kaa darja de diya he
 That is, the Jains will also take advantage of the government schemes and programs being run for the minorities

 gauratlab he ki faisle se ek dinapahale hi samudaay kaa pratinidhimandal congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mila tha

 ham sabhi ke man main kai tarah kii baaten hoti hai
 Some we share with others and some just like to keep to ourselves
 par kai baar baton ko man main rakhana hamaari chintaa kaa kaaran bhi ban jaataa he lekin is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki kuch baaten raaj rahen to hi behatar
 Keeping any secret in love affairs and marital relationships can prove dangerous for the relationship, but many things happen in every relationship which even mian-biwi cannot share
 ye wo baaten hoti he jinhenchipaane se kisi ko koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 Here is a mention of some such secret which women usually hide from men: 1
 puraane prem prasangon ke bare menzyaadaatar auraton ko lagata he ki agar unhone apane partner ko puraane pyaar ke bare main bataa diya to unka partner unhen galat maan legaa
 In such a situation, it is better to hide their old relationship and love affair
 2
 Girls talk are the things that women shy away from sharing with men and men should also try to stay away from these things
 jis tarah har ladkaa apane doston ke saath kuch aisi chijen or baaten share karata hajo wo apni partner se nahin kar saktaa usee tarah mahilaon ke bhi bahut se raaj hote hai
 3
 mechap kaa boxzyaadaatar auraten apane mechap box ko ek raaj banaakar rakhana pasand karti hai
 They do not like to have someone peep into their makeup box
 unhen lagata he ki taank-jhaank karne vaala shaks unke bare main pataa karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 4
 parivaar ke bare menladakiyon ko bilkul pasand nahin hota he ki unka partner unke ghar se jude kisi bhi maamle ko lekar un par taane kase
 In such a situation, she considers hiding a lot of things related to her house, especially negative things from her partner
 loksabhaa chunaav ke duusare charan main uttar pradesh kii 8 loksabhaa siton par 18 april ko matdaan honge
 Elections are to be held in Nagina, Amroha, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura, Agra and Fatehpur Sikri seats
 soobe kii ye sabhi 8 loksabhaa siten pashchim uttar pradesh kii hai
 The second phase of the election battle is seen between BJP vs BSP
 haalanki isi daur main congress pradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar kii pratishtha bhi daanv par lagi hui he
 The 8 seats in the second phase are elections
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in sabhi 8 siton par bijepi ko jeet mili thi
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, under the seat sharing of the SP-BSP-RLD alliance, the BSP has contested on 6 seats
 ye siten nagina, amroha, bulandshahr, aligarh, agra or fatehpur sikri hai
 While SP is contesting on Hathras seat and RLD in Mathura seat
 isse saaf jaahir he ki duusare charan main mayawati banaam modi ke bich siyaasi ghamaasan hona he
 Nagina has 2 Lok Sabha seats in the triangular contest Bijnor district, the first of which is Bijnor
 nagina loksabhaa seat anusuchit jati ke arakshit he
 In the alliance, this seat has gone to the bsp's account
 yahaan se basapa ke girish chandra maidan main he
 While BJP has placed bets on sitting MP Yashwant Singh and Congress on former IAS RK Singh's wife Omvati
 is seat par gathbandhan or congress donon kii najar dalit or muslim voton par he
 Whereas BJP along with Rajput and non-jatav Dalit wants to hoist the victory again by keeping Jat voters in their court
 aise main nagina seat par trikoniya muqabla hota hua najar aa rahaa he
 Political critics say that a large section of Muslims may go with the alliance
 amroha: bijepi banaam baspamroha loksabhaa seat se basapa ne jedies se aae kunwar danish ko maidan main utaara he
 At the same time, the BJP bets on its current MP Kanwar Singh Tawanr, while the Congress has fielded Sachin Chaudhary after Rashid Alvi refused
 amroha seat ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen to kareeb 5 lakh muslim, 2
 5 lakh Dalits, 1 lakh Gurjars, 1 lakh Kashyap, 1
 5 lakh jat or 95 hajaar lodh matadaata hai
 BSP candidate Kunwar wants to win election with the help of Danish Muslims, Dalits and Jats
 jabaki bijepi ummidavaar gurjar, kashyap, lodh or jat matadaataaon ke jariye dobaaraa se jeetne khwab dekh rahe hai, lekin congress ne bhi sachin choudhary ko maidan main utarkar unki raah main mushkil kar di he
 Bulandshahr: BSP has fielded Yogesh Verma on the direct fight in BSP-BJP
 jabaki bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad bholaa singh par ek baar phir bharosa jataayaa he or congress ne purv vidhayak bansi singh pahadiya ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 BJP had won this seat in 2014 by nearly four lakh votes, but this time the political equations seem to have changed considerably
 aise main bijepi ke liye dobaaraa se jeetna aasaan nahin dikh rahaa he
 In terms of political equation, about 1 in Bulandshahr seat
 5 lakh brahman, 1 lakh rajput, 1 lakh yadav, 1 lakh jat, 3
 5 lakh Dalits, 2
 5 lakh muslim or 2 lakh lodh matadaata hai
 In such a situation, Yogesh Verma of BSP is engaged in practicing Dalit votes along with Muslim and Yadav
 vahiin, bijepi ke bholaa singh lodh, brahman, rajput maton ke sahare jeet doharaana chaahate hai
 But the way Brahmin leader Guddu Pandit of Bulandshahr has joined the BSP at the last moment
 aise main brahmanon ke vot main basapa bhi sendhamari kar sakati he
 In the political battle of Aligarh Lok Sabha seat in Aligarh, BSP has fielded Ajit Balyan, BJP sitting MP Satish Gautam and Congress Chaudhary Bijendra Singh
 teen pramukh partiyon ke netaa ek duusare kam nahin hai
 It is believed that there is a triangular contest
 haalanki jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se dekhen to yadav, brahman, rajput or jat ke kareeb dedh-dedh lakh vot hai
 Whereas Dalits are around 3 lakh and 2 lakh Muslim voters
 ise votbank kii najar se denkhe to basapa or congress donon ne jat ummidavaar utaare hai to bijepi ne rajput par daanv khelaa he
 Kalyan Singh is not happy with the BJP candidate
 aise main bijepi ke liye jeet kii raah aasaan nahin he
 The Hathras SP vs BJP Hathras Lok Sabha seat has gone to the sp's account and the SP has fielded former Union Minister Ramjilal Suman
 vahiin, bijepi ne rajvir singh balmiki or congress ne trilokiram divakar ko maidan main utaara he
 However, this seat is considered to be Jat dominated
 is seat par kareeb 3 lakh jat, 2 lakh brahman, 1
 5 lakh Rajputs, 3 lakh Dalits, 1
 5 lakh baghel or 1
 There are 25 lakh Muslim voters
 raajnneetik jaankaron kii maane to is seat par sapa banaam bijepi ke bich muqabla hota dikh rahaa he
 Agra: Jangagara Lok Sabha seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes between BJP-BSP
 is seat par basapa ne manoj soni, bijepi ne espi singh baghel or congress ne prita harith ko maidan main utaara he
 BJP SP Baghel has lived in SP and BSP, so Muslim voters have a good hold
 is tarah se bijepi ke saath-saath baghel duusare dalon ke votbank ko saadhane main kaamyaab rahete hai to ek baar phir camel khil saktaa he
 Although this old area of BSP has been in such a situation, BSP also has high expectations from this region, but Congress state president Raj Babbar has also represented this seat
 aise main unka bhi apana ek aadhaar he
 RLD vs BJP in Mathura: RLD in the Mathura Lok Sabha seat has gone to the account of RLD
 bijepi ne ek baar phir hema malini ko utaara he
 Whereas, RLD has fielded Kunwar Narendra Singh and Congress candidate Mahesh Pathak on this seat
 yah seat jat bahul maani jaati he yahaan kareeb 4 lakh jat samudaay ke matadaata hai
 While 2
 5 lakh brahman or 2
 There are also 5 lakh Rajput voters
 itane hi dalit matadaata hai or dhed lakh ke kareeb muslim hai
 In such a situation, if the RLD candidates manage to help the Rajputs as well as Jat Muslims and Dalits, then for the BJP, winning this seat will be like chewing iron gram
 fatehpur sikri: trikoniya muqablafatehpur sikri loksabhaa seat gathbandhan ke tahat basapa ke khate main gai he
 The BSP has fielded Guddu Pandit from here
 jabaki bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad babulal choudhary kaa tikat katkar rajkumaar chaher ko diya he
 At the same time, state president Raj Babbar from Congress is in the fray
 yahaan teenon partiyon ke ummidavaar kaaphi majboot maane ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is a possibility of a triangular fight
 world cap main bharat kaa number chaar ballebaaj koun hoga? pichley kuch samay se chal rahi is charchaa main dakshin africa ke purv captain capler vaisals bhi shaamil ho gaye hai or unka maananaa he ki captain viraat kohli ko is mahatvapurn sthaan par ballebaaji ke liye utarana chahie
 Vessels also conceded that South Africa deserves the title of 'chokers' and will hold on to it until it wins a major ICC tournament
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki viraat kohli number chaar sthaan ke liye sabase upyukt ballebaaj rahenge
 He can finish the innings by getting to this place and can also score fast runs if needed
 unke liye number chaar adarsh sthaan ho saktaa he
 Kohli, however, has not been particularly successful at number four
 apane kariyar main vah ab tak keval 38 maichon main hi is sthaan par utre hai jabaki number teen unka pasandida sthaan he jis par vah 166 maichon main ballebaaji ke liye utre hai
 Vessels was speaking to reporters via video conferencing from Australia on the occasion of the announcement of events related to the World Cup of Web TV channel 'power Sports'
 australia ke purv tej gendbaaj endi bikel ne haalanki mana ki bharat ke paas number chaar ke liye kai vikalp hai lekin unhen lagata he ki keel rahul is sthaan ke liye sabase upyukt khilaadi ho sakate hai
 Bickel said, 'rahul is in good form right now and can handle the number four responsibility well
 team main mahendra singh dhoni he jo ek se chah number tak kisi bhi sthaan par ballebaaji kar saktaa he
 Vijay Shankar is a young talented batsman
 kul milakar bharat ke paas number chaar ke kai vikalp he
 This is a good headache for the team management
 'vaisals ne bharat ko khitaab kaa prabal daavedaar qaraar diya
 Apart from this, he also deserved the semi-finals of England and Australia
 unhone kaha, 'bharat ke jeet kii bahut acchhee sambhaavna he
 His team is very good in odis
 england bhi khatarnaak team ho sakati he lekin uske khilaadiyon ko gharelu darshakon ke saamne khelnaa he or unhen apni bhaawanaaon par kaabo rakhana hoga
 Vessels said, "australia is the third team which has good chances
" do maheene pehle tak australia kii koi sambhaavna nahin thi lekin ab unki sabase majboot team khel rahi he
 Apart from these three, the fourth team of the semi-finals can be one of South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan
 'australia or dakshin africa donon kii taraf se khilne vaale vaisals ne kaha ki dakshin africa team jab tak bada toornament nahin jeet jaati tab tak chokars kaa tamgaa uskaa peechha nahin chhodega
 In response to a question, he said, 'yes, it will be a' Tamga 'on them till they win a big ICC tournament
 ve is tamge ke hakdaar hai
 The best example of this is 1999 when they were the best team in the tournament
 westeindies main aisa hua
 The current team has a good captain in the form of Duplessis who is capable of getting the best out of his players
 'vaisals ne kaha, 'dakshin africa main team se kaaphi apekshaayen hai lekin is baar vishwa bhar main unase utani apekshaayen nahin kii ja rahi hai
 He is not considered a strong contender for the title
 ve anderdog ke rup main shuruyaat karenge lekin unki team main kuch achche cricketer hai or team santulit he
 However, he said that the team will miss AB de Villiers who has retired from international cricket
 vaisals ne kaha, 'abi kisi bhi team ke liye ahm sabit ho saktaa he or mujhe lagata he ki uskaa team main nahin hona dakshin africa ke liye bada jhatka he
 In his absence, Hashim Amla will have to bear the important responsibility
 ' The leg-spinner also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in April this year but received no response
 pakistan kii taraf se 61 test match khilne vaale caneria par 2012 main england evam wales cricket board ne spot phixing ke maamle main aaajeevan pratibandh laga diya tha
 He then appealed twice to lift the ban but was rejected

 Shalabhanjikamanisha Kulshreshtha Bharatiya Jnanpith, Lodhi Road, New Delhi-3, Price: Rs

 net Shalabhanjika is a relatively short novel by Manisha Kulshrestha
 isamen stri-purush jis sambandh kii maang se paidaa hue hai, usamen jatilta he
 The happy wires of the future are entangled, which both resolve, scramble, and get up in the middle
 yah man or deh donon kii jarurat kaa sambandh he
 They are against sentimentality in relationships
 phir bhi purush chahta he ki stri kii deh uske saamne bisaat kii tarah bichhi rahe or vah rochakata ke saath yah mjedaar khel khele
 The novel has two frames - one of a woman; Second man's
 manisha donon frem todane kii koshish main hai
 The question is that the honesty with which a writer can present a woman's perspective, will she test the male perspective with the same honesty? Manisha has handled this question very cleverly
 aatmakathy style main rachaa-buna yah upanyaas purush ko purush ke nazariye se or stri ko stri ke nazariye se rakhata he
 The man is in the center and the woman complements him
 poorak hote hue bhi usamen itani kshamta he ki vah purush main samaa bhi sakati he or agle hi kshan usase mukt bhi ho sakati he
 This complex relationship between men and women is characteristic of the plot of the novel
 nayak chetan apni puraani premika padma ko aadhaar banaakar film bananaa chahta he
 Through this, he has to fill his emptiness
 padma ke kirdaar ke liye usne chunaa grashell ko jo na keval kirdaar ko balki chetan ke jehan main bhi padma ko jinda kar detii he
 padma-chetan Grashel's relationship tells the story of the changing relationship between men and women
 upanyaas main rishton kaa 'ateet' he, smritiyaan hai, vartmaan bhi he par bhavishya gaayab
 Probably not decided what will be the future of the man-woman relationship
 ateet nostelgia kii tarah baitha he-stri or purush donon main, jisaki parinti kalatmak hoti he
 Despite this, the present is influenced by the past and memories
 grashell kaa vartmaan padma ke ateet se baar-baar takaraata he
 Chetan discovers Padma in Grashel, catches Grashel
 vah kahati he, ''tum mere bheetar ko nahin badal paa rahe, is baat kii khij kyon? aa'm note padma
 Does not match anything with him and mine
 '' ekanishthata se dur bhaagti grashell ko ekanishthata ke sawaal se hi jujhna padataa he
 She has risen above body questions
 deh uski nijee sampatti he, shraddha kaa vishay nahin
 The past can no longer stain his body and the present is his
 manisha is maamle main spasht hai or unki grashell or padma bhi
 What attracts most in the novel is the tightness of language
 ruhani or jismani sambandhon ke kshanon main bhashaa behad paripakv dikhi
 Manisha's language and style of speaking makes her different from others and makes her better
 is hafte gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel dilli gayi, pradhanmantri narendra modi se milin or phir puri dilli or gujarat main ye charchaa shuru ho gai ki gujarat main mukhyamantri badla ja rahaa he
 Whereas the truth was that Anandiben met the Prime Minister to discuss the drought situation in the state
 kya bina chingaari ke hi ye hawa uthi ki anandiben ko badla ja rahaa he
 It is true that a senior BJP leader in Delhi must have spread this fact or else this wind does not arise in the media
 aakhir aisa koun he jo anandiben ko asthir karnaa chahta he or kyon
 Let us introduce you to some such facts of Gujarat politics, which will at least make it clear that everything is not right in Gujarat BJP, so this discussion has been going on continuously
 anandiben patel ke hathaaye jane kii charchaa pehali baar nahin uthi he
 When Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, his favorite Amit Shah was seen in Gujarat as his natural successor
 gujarat bhaajapa main zyaadaatar log ye maanate the ki amit shah hi modi ke baad gujarat kii gaddi sanbhaalenge
 But Narendra Modi did not want this and he could not even remove Amit Shah, after all Amit Shah has always been one of the people closest to Narendra Modi
 saath hi narendra modi kii sabase bharosemand sahyogiyon main amit shah ke alaava thim anandiben patel
 But it was interesting that Amit Shah and Anandiben never existed
 donon ko hameshaa se hi ek duusare se khatra tha
 Therefore, both had to handle Narendra Modi
 lihaaza anandiben gujarat kii gaddi par baithi or amit shah ko kaha gaya rashtriya raajnneeti main sakriy rahane ko or ye bhi bharosa diya gaya ki wo party ke nae rashtriya adhyaksh honge
 Everything looked fine outside, so Anandiben's name was also proposed to Amit Shah
 ek tir se do shikaar kiye modi ne
 Amit Shah agreed despite the resentment, the signs went well and Anandiben's problems were less because of Amit Shah's stay away from Gujarat
 lekin sirf amit shah hi nahin party main zyaadaatar log anandiben se khafa the
 Anandiben is a bit impassable by nature, she gives a very bold answer to anyone else, not political
 isliye anandiben jab se mukhyamantri baniin, bhaajapa main unke khilaaf asantosh rahaa lekin narendra modi kii pasand thim isliye kisi kii khulkar virodh karne kii himmat nahin thi
 Therefore, the first campaign against her was that she had become old and had cancer
 iske bare main kisi ne khule taur par charchaa nahin kii lekin jab bhi chuphi baaten hoti thim to isaki charchaa hone lagi
 It has even increased that they can be removed due to health
 anandiben ne chunki ye khuli charchaa nahin thi, kabhi is par baat nahin kii
 But she kept working for 15-16 hours a day
 jawaab saaf tha, kya koi biimaar aadmi itnaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Dinesh Sharma was then in charge of Gujarat
 sabhi ke baavjood charchaa yahaan tak pahunchi ki dinesh sharma ko kahana padaa ki anandiben ko badalane kii baaten nirarthak hai or wo bahut acha kaam kar rahi hai
 Opponents' faces fell silent for a few days
 lekin phir pichley saal agast main patidaar andolan shuru hua
 The propaganda was done that Anandiben does not want a solution from the Patidars, so she is not letting the movement go
 patidaaron kii badi raily ke ek din pehle hi anandiben ne akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar saaf kar diya ki unhen aarakshan dena samvidhan ke mutabik sambhav nahin
 In December of the same year, in the election of local bodies, the opponents were hopeful that Anandiben could be defeated badly
 bhaajapa haari lekin sirf gramin ilaakon main, apane garh main shaharon main puri tarah haaavee raheen
 Opponents did not get a chance again
 lekin pichley kuch dinon main kuch ghatnaayen huin jisane phir is charchaa ko hawa di
 BJP President Amit Shah first came to Gujarat on 29 April
 shah, anandiben or pradesh adhyaksh vijay roopaani kii baithak hui bhaajapa mukhyalay main
 After the meeting, Rupani announced a reservation for 10 percent economic upper castes at a press conference
 anandiben patel bagal main baithi
 Although this decision should have been official, but after Rupani's announcement, the power shift was happening
 lekin baat ye thi ki anandiben patel ab bhi is faisle se sahamat nahin thim, lekin narendra modi ke green signal ke baad virodh kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 So she kept herself from the announcement
 whatsap par bina naam ke massej ghoomane lage ki gujarat main satta parivartan ho rahaa he
 Opponents never denied
 roopaani amit shah kheme ke maane jate hai to iskaa khandan na karnaa ek tarah se ise hawa dena hi he
 So on Monday, Anandiben went to meet Narendra Modi to discuss the drought
 nitin patel, gujarat ke swasthya mantri, dilli gayi neet pariksha ke mudde par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel also met Amit Shah
 amit shah ke karibiyon ne ise jod diya or charchaa ched di ki nitin patel naye mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 The comments sabhi kah rahe hai ki amit shah ab gujarat ke shah nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 It is kept that 10 Chief Ministers line up in front of National President, why would Amit Shah want to become Chief Minister
 lekin iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he ki aakhir amit shah kyon gujarat ke maamuli vidhayak bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 While they are not present in the assembly also
 puure saal sirf bajet seshan main ek din hi aa pate hai
 The reason is simple, Amit Shah is still keen on becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 in sab charchaaon ko haalanki anandiben ne khud viraam diya he
 But before Anandiben, Narendra Modi himself has made it clear by tweeting his work that he is still trusted by Modi
 aise main bhaajapa main virodh chalata rahegaa anandiben ke khilaaf lekin unhen nuksaan kar paanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Yes, but Gujarat has assembly elections in 2017
 gujarat main jeetna modi ke liye bhi ahm he
 Therefore, if the controversy continues, the performance of the party can be affected
 isliye shaayad modi khud anandiben ko chunaavon se pehle ek gauravpurn vidaay den, governor banaakar
 But it still has time
 aaiye aapako gujarat kii raajnneeti ke kuch aise tathyon se parichit karavaaen jisase ye to kam se kam saaf ho jayega ki gujarat bhaajapa main sabakuch thik nahin he isliye ye charchaa lagaataar chalati rahi he
 The discussion about the removal of Anandiben Patel has not arisen for the first time
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi jab desh ke pradhanmantri bane tabhi se gujarat main unke naiysargik uttaradhikari ke taur par unke chahete amit shah ko dekha ja rahaa tha
 Most people in the Gujarat BJP believed that Amit Shah would take over the throne of Gujarat after Modi
 lekin narendra modi ye nahin chaahate the or wo amit shah ko hataa bhi nahin sakate the, aakhir amit shah hameshaa se hi narendra modi ke sabase kareebi logon main se rahe hai
 Also, among the most trusted allies of Narendra Modi, besides Amit Shah, was Anandiben Patel
 lekin maze kii baat thi ki amit shah or anandiben ke bich kabhi nahin bani
 Both were always in danger from each other
 isliye donon ko narendra modi ko sanbhaalanaa tha
 So Anandiben sat on the throne of Gujarat and Amit Shah was told to be active in national politics and also assured that he would be the new national president of the party
 baahar sabakuch thik dikhe isliye anandiben ke naam kaa prastaav bhi karavaaya amit shah se
 Modi shot two birds with one stone
 amit shah naaraazgi ke baavjood maan gayi, sanket achche gayi or amit shah ke gujarat se dur rahane kii vajah se anandiben kii mushkilen kam raheen
 But not only Amit Shah, most of the people in the party were angry with Anandiben
 anandiben swabhaav se thodi bebaak hai, kisi kii baat janchi nahin to rajnatik nahin ekadam bold jawaab de detii hai
 Therefore, ever since Anandiben became the Chief Minister, there was discontent against him in the BJP but Narendra Modi was the choice, so no one dared to openly oppose him
 isliye sabase pehle unke khilaaf campan kiya gaya ki wo budhi ho gai hai or unhen cancer ho gaya
 Nobody discussed it openly, but whenever there were hidden things, it started being discussed
 baat yahaan tak bad gai ki swasthya kii vajah se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Anandiben, since it was not an open discussion, never talked about it
 lekin wo din main 15-16 ghante kaam karti raheen
 The answer was simple, can a sick man do so much work
 tab dinesh sharma gujarat ke prabharee the
 Despite all the discussion reached here that Dinesh Sharma had to say that the talk of changing Anandiben is meaningless and she is doing a great job
 virodhiyon ke munh kuch dinon ke liye chup ho gayi
 But then in August last year, the Patidar movement started
 prachaar aisa kiya gaya ki anandiben patidaaron se samaadhaan nahin chaahatin isliye wo andolan chalane nahin de rahi hai
 a day before the big Patidar rally, Anandiben made it clear by giving advertisements in newspapers that it was not possible to give them reservation according to the constitution
 usee saal disambar main sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav main virodhiyon ko ummid thi ki anandiben buree tarah haar sakati hai
 The BJP lost but completely dominated the cities in its stronghold, only in rural areas
 virodhiyon ko phir mauka nahin mila
 But there have been some incidents in the last few days which again aired this discussion
 sabase pehle 29 april ko bhaajapa ke adhyaksh amit shah gujarat aaye
 Shah, Anandiben and state president Vijay Rupani met at BJP headquarters
 meeting ke baad roopaani ne press conference karke 10 pratishat aarthik savarna pichhadon ke liye aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anandiben Patel sat next
 haalanki ye faisla sarkari hona chahie tha lekin roopaani kii ghoshnaa ke baad laga ki power shift ho rahaa he
 But the point was that Anandiben Patel still did not agree with this decision, but there was no scope of protest after Narendra Modi's green signal
