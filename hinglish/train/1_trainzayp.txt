 a post shared by Alia (@aliaabhatt) on Sep 24, 2017 at 10:25pm pdtraazi a post shared by Vicky Kaushal (@vickykaushal09) on Sep 13, 2017 at 10:53pm PDT Two-time former champions Chennai, troubled by off-field activities, would like to bring their focus back to cricket from their opening T20 League clash against Punjab here on Friday
 pichley teen satr main dabadabaa banane vaali chennai kii team is samay spot phixing prakaran se jujh rahi he, jisamen iske kuch khilaadiyon ke alaava sheersh adhikariyon ko bhi aaropon ke ghere main rakhaa gaya he
 Coach Stephen Fleming, however, admitted that off-the-field issues cannot be ignored and this is a distraction for the team
 fleming ne sattebaaji vivaad kaa zikr karte hue kaha, kaaphi kuch chal rahaa he, main jhooth nahin kahuunga
 Too much to distract before the tournament happened
 mujhe lagata he ki ham sabhi anishchit the ki isamen kya hoga
 But the Chennai team, which struggled with the spot-fixing controversy, can be called one of the most relentless teams in the IPL, led by Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 is saal chennai kii team apane kuch nirbhar sitaron ke bina maidan par utregi, jisamen australian khilaadi maaikel hasi or dakshin africa ke albi morkal shaamil hai jinhen team ne khilaadiyon kii nilaamee main kho diya tha
 But the presence of New Zealand explosive batsman Brendon mccullum makes the Chennai team look strong
 sahvaag se hai punjab ko ummidagendbaaji main westeindies ke leg spinner samual badri mahatvapurn khilaadi sabit ho sakate hai kyonki haal main vishwa cap twanti20 main sarvaadhik wicket chatakaane vaale tisare gendbaaj hone ke naate unka aatmavishvaas badha hua hoga
 The Punjab franchise did not do well in the last season, but the team has made a balance by making some important purchases in the players' auction
 australian george beli kii aguwai vaali punjab ne bhartiya test team se baahar chal rahe visphotak ballebaaj virendra sahvaag ko hasil kiya
 Although this player is not in form, this Delhi batsman is adept at changing the attitude of the match by destroying the opposition team's attack
 masterstroke sabit ho sakate hai jansonbeli ne toornament se pehle kaha tha, isamen koi shaq nahin he ki uskaa kaaphi bada asar hoga
 His presence in the team is a great thing
 unka maidan main bina kisi dabaav ke khelnaa shandaar hoga
 The Punjab team played a masterstroke by purchasing Mitchell Johnson in the auction
 yah australian apni behtareen farm main he or ummid he ki vah punjab kii un par kharch kii gai 6
 Pai will pay the amount of Rs 5 crores
 iske alaava team austrailian ballebaaj shaan marsh ko bhi waapas laane main safal rahi
 If fitness is right, Marsh can prove to be an important player for the team, which has a good record in T20 league
 kagaji aankadon ko dekhte hue donon tiimon ke bich barabari kaa muqabla hone kii ummid he
 On 27th of November, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma introduced electronic visa scheme for tourists coming from 43 countries
 is skim ke tahat bharat aane vaale paryatakon ko yahaan kii dharti par utarate hi ek maheene kaa tourist vija jari kar diya jayega
 In this way, they will be able to take advantage of Immigration, Visa, Foreigner Registration and Tracking System (IVFRT)
 is system ko taiyaar hone main puure chaar saal kaa vakt laga or isamen 1,100 karod ru
 Cost of 26 november, 2008 ko mumbai par hue aatanki hamale se sikh lete hue grih mantralay ne may 2010 main is pahal kii shuruyaat kii thi
 This need was particularly felt in view of the flaws that caused David Coleman Headley to move between the terrorist camps in Pakistan and Mumbai for two whole years, but the immigration authorities did not hear about it
 2009 main jab hedli kii giraftaar hui to satark khufia vibhaag (ibi) ne paryaton mantralay kii tourist vija on arival (tivioe) skim kaa laabh or bhi deshon se aane vaale paryatakon ko die jane ke prastaav main adangha daalaa
 But with the IVFRT system, all the objections of the Intelligence Department were ignored
 is system ko neshnal informatics centre ne hi viksit kiya he
 With the help of this new system, there will be a synergy between all the offices issuing clearances related to visas and immigration
 isamen grih mantralay, videsh mantralay, ibi, fahrenurs registration offises or videshon main sthit 150 mishan ke karyaalay bhi shaamil hai
 In this system, all the information of the visa applicant is recorded and on the basis of this, it keeps tracking that tourist till going out of India
 electronic vija milane se paryaton ko to badhaava milegaa hi, iviefarti ke or phaayde bhi hai
 For example, the complete profile of the traveler is available
 isse taskaron par najar rakhi ja sakegi or sone tathaa nashili dawaaiyon kii taskari ke tareeke pataa chal sakenge
 Though some aspects like gathering biometric information of the applicant in IVFRT have not started yet, but according to the officials, when it starts, it will not be easy to cheat this system
 america raashtrapati baraak obama kii bahucharchit misr yatra ke pehle din obama ne kaha ki vah america or muslim jagat ke bich ek nayi shuruyaat chaahane ke liye misr aae hai
 Addressing hundreds of enthusiastic people in the dome hall of Cairo University, Obama said that to move forward we must listen to each other and learn from each other and respect each other
 koi ek bhaashan varshon ke avishvaas ko dur nahin kar saktaa
 Obama has said that America and Islam are not separate and there is no need for any rivalry
 isamen koi andeh na rakhen ki islam america kaa hissaa he
 Obama said that the US does not want a permanent presence of its army in Afghanistan
 akele sainya shakti se afghanistan or pakistan main samasya hal nahin ho sakati or yahi kaaran he ki america unhen madad muhaiyaa kara rahaa he
 Obama said that by 2012 all US troops would be withdrawn from Iraq
 gujarat ke mukhmantri nenarendra modipane 'shabdabaan' ke liye jane jate hai
 Modi targeted the Prime Minister and said that Manmohan Singh should get an Oscar Award for acting PM
 modi ne ravivaar ko ek samaaroh ke dauraan kaha, 'haal hi main mere paas ek esemes aayaa, jisamen likhaa tha ki bharat kemphn manmohan sinhako auskar se nawaja gaya he, jab maine is bare main pataa kiya to pataa chalaa ki unhen PM ke taur par acting karne ke liye auskar aword se nawaja gaya he
 'significantly, the BJP has always been calling Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the weakest and remote-run Prime Minister of the country
 pune main gujarati bandhu samaaj dwaara yojit is kaarykram main CM modi ke khaas nishane par manmohan singh hi rahe
 By the way, on Sunday, Modi attended five celebrations held in the city
 congressiyon ko kosne vaale modi ne inamen se ek kaarykram ke dauraan congressi saansad or kaamanwealth games ghotaalon ke aaropee suresh kalmari se haath milaane se manaa kar unhen jhidak diya
 Significantly, since coming out of jail, Suresh Kalmadi has been trying to appear in all public events, so Modi's rebuke to him was also a matter of discussion in the city

 gauratlab he ki paanch rajyon ke haalia vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar ke samay rahul ne ek jansabha main kaha tha ki unhen pataa chalaa he ki pakistan kii khufia agency- inter services intelligence (iesai) mujffarnagar ke hinsa peedit muslim yuvaaon se sampark saadh rahi he
 Meanwhile, on Rahul's visit to relief camps without any prior notice, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said, 'congress leaders have gone to Muzaffarnagar
 agar unka koi suzav hoga to samaajawaadee party sarkaar us par amal karegi
 'significantly, on September 8, 62 people lost their lives and around 50,000 people were left homeless in Muzaffarnagar and adjoining areas between two classes

 There are many types of news about Priyanka Gandhi often
 lekin is khabar ne logon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa ki vah varanasi se loksabhaa chunaav ladanaa chaahati thim lekin aalaa kaman se ijaajat nahin mili
 She wanted the bjp's PM candidate to hand over Narendra Modi directly
 or agar aisa hota to vaaki is puure lok sabha chunaav paridrishy kaa sabase dilachasp najaara hota
 But now she is only taking part in campaigning for her brother Rahul Gandhi and mother Sonia Gandhi
 yani is chunaav main unka role bahut simit he or vah sirf apano ke hi haath majboot karengi
 It is indeed surprising that despite Priyanka Gandhi's popularity, she never got the position she deserved politically
 vah apane bhai or maa ke nirvachan kshetra main kaaphi lokapriy hai or unhone vahaan gum-gum kar kaaphi prachaar bhi kiya he
 He also knows the pulse of the people there
 aise main unke khadey hone se party ke hataash kaaryakartaaon ke hausale buland ho jate
 Priyanka has a youthful enthusiasm and an understanding of politics
 aise main unhen chunaav se dur rakhane kaa faisla kyon hua, yah baat samaj se pare hai
 Perhaps the high command would think that this would make Robert Vadra's case more public and there would be tremendous attacks on the Gandhi family
 yaa phir priyanka par bahut keechad uchhaali jaaegi
 The matter of Vadra's property and his involvement in many cases has been jumping for a long time
 congress alaakaman isse bachanaa chahta he or nahin chahta ki yah chunaav main bahut bada mudda bane
 Perhaps thinking like this, the party may have decided to keep them away
 abhi hi party kai tarah ke vivaadon se jujh rahi he or raksha kii niti apanaae hue he, aise main priyanka par vyaktigat hamalaa us par baari pad saktaa tha
 However, keeping the Priyanka Gandhi separate from electoral politics, the party will not benefit
 unke sakriy hone kaa nishchit rup se phayda use miltaa
 He has a natural charm that reminds the old people of his grandmother Indira ji
 aaj kii raajnneeti main congress ko aisi shakhsiyat kii jarurat he
 The party, which has been facing the biggest challenge of its political life since 1977, may not have made a conscious decision
 usne raksha kii niti apanaae rakhane main hi bhalaai samajhi Dewaris Dixon, who lives in Watts near Los Angeles, had ordered chicken tenders from KFC, a world-renowned food chain, but found a fried rat
 viral hui tasveerdikson ne is chuuhe kii doshasvirenfesbuk par post kii, jo viral ho gai
 It has been shared more than one lakh times
 unhone kaha, main waapas gaya or keeffsi manager ko is bare main bataaya
 He admitted that it was a fried rat
 manager ne mujhe muft main khaanaa ofer kiya, lekin maine inkaar kar diya
 Dixon says he has hired a lawyer and will now file a case against the company
 keeffsi ne aaropon se kiya inkaarhalanki keeffsi ne safai di he, 'hamane graahak se sampark karne ke kai prayaas kiye, lekin unhone hamase khud yaa apane vakil ke jariye baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 Our chicken tenders are in many sizes and shapes and at the moment we do not have evidence to justify their allegations
 pehle di thi ye safihalanki pehlekeefisine safai di thi, 'ham graahakon ke daawey ko puri gambhirtha se lete hai or ham is maamle kii lagaataar jaanch kar rahe hai

 Sushil's hopes of making a place in the Rio Olympics were shattered on Monday when the Delhi High Court dismissed his plea seeking a selection trial
 adaalat ne kaha ki isse chaynit khilaadi narsingh pancham yadav ke maukon ko jhatka lagegaa or desh ko ‘nuksaan’ pahonchega
 Justice Manmohan acknowledged Sushil's achievements at the international level and called him a great wrestler in the 66kg category
 lekin unhen 74 kigra varg main olympic ke liye chunauti pesh karne kaa mauka nahin diya
 The court said that Sushil's plea seeking direction to the Indian Wrestling Federation to direct the selection trials for India's representation in the 74 kg category of men at the Rio Olympics is unenforceable in the eyes of the law and is also contrary to the facts
 do baar ke olympic padak vijeta ke bare main puche jane par bindra ne kaha, ‘‘uske saath sthiti kaaphi jatil thi

 is saal 14 farvari 2014 ke din arvind kejariwal ne 49 dinon tak mukhyamantri rahane ke baad apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 The TV that attempted to convert that resignation into the immortal saga is now missing both Manzar and Khanjar of that resignation from the same TV
 log bhul chuke hai ki istipha kyon hua, arvind maafee maang chuke hai ki galati ho gai
 The BJP has said that if the government does not run, then leave
 kaise kanat place ke daftar kii pehali manzil kii khidki se arvind ne elaan kiya tha ki ve mukhyamantri kii gaddi chhod rahe hai
 How dramatic was the resignation, in the era of resignation, it seemed moral
 isi din main mumbai se dilli aa rahaa tha
 At the airport where the TV was installed, people clung to what Arvind would do now
 us shaam dilli main koob barish hui thi
 But from 14 February till today, the political debate in Delhi did not return towards the post office of Jan Lokpal and Lokpal
 2011 se 2013 ke bich is mudde ne logon ko gharon se khub nikaala

 The Prime Minister is speaking on the radio that nobody knows how much black money is there, but trust him for the pie
 udhar, kuch log yaad dilaa rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ne chunaav main phir kyon kaha ki kaala dhan aayega to har naagarik ko teen-teen lakh rupee milenge

 Without Janlokpal and corruption, how will the Aam Aadmi Party save itself in this election, how will the BJP stake its claim on this issue by not taking three lakh rupees but by taking other steps, it is a question but this time Delhi will give a decision on the issue of corruption

 Portugal will face Spain on Wednesday night in the first semi-final of the Euro Cup, so all eyes will be on one player and that is Cristiano Ronaldo
 portugal ko agar kitaab apane naam karnaa he, to uske star khilaadi ronaldo ko har haal main apni chamak dikhaani hogi
 If Ronaldo does not progress to the semi-finals, Portugal will stand with their Euro Cup history
 euro main portugal kaa itihaas kuch acha nahin rahaa he
 In 2008, Portugal traveled to the quarterfinals, and in 2004 Greece defeated the Euro hosting Portugal in the final, and Greece broke her dream of winning the title
 saal 2000 main france ke haathon haar kar portugal semifinal se aage bad saki
 However, Portugal's record against Spain is not bad
 2010 ke world cap main spain ne portugal ko 1−0 se zarur haraaya tha, lekin usee saal ek dostana match main portugal ne spain ko 4−0 se maat di thi
 Obviously, this thing will definitely give some relief to the players of Portugal
 portugal ke khilaadiyon ne euro 2012 kaa taj pahanane ke liye qamar kas lee he or vah is dafaa jeet ke liye kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hai
 On the other hand Spain, the World Champion and defending champion of the Euro Cup, have not been seen in top form in Euro 2012 matches
 portugal ke kilaaf match main spain ke captain iker kasilas ek ahm record se ek kadam dur hai
 If Spain win the semi-finals, then captain Iker Casillas will be the first player to register 100 wins in international football
 pehle kuch maichon main karaab pradarshan karne ke baad ronaldo ne holland ke kilaaf apane khel ke str ko upar uthaate hue do shandaar gol kiye
 Spain are in no mood to make any changes to their game, given Ronaldo's form
 spain kii difence uski majbooti he or team ne apni majbooti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue khel main khaas badlaav naa karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 When Ronaldo takes the field against Spain, it will be very difficult for him to face his friends
 spain kii team main unke saamne honge kasilas or zaabi alonso jaise khilaadi jo unke riyal madrid club ke saathi hai
 Ronaldo can be relieved that Barcelona's players Gerrard Peek and Andres Iniesta will also be present in the Spanish team

 Party supporters and activists expressed happiness by fireworks outside the Congress headquarters, distributing sweets and dancing and singing
 congress adhyaksh ke rup main apane pehle bhaashan main rahul ne modi or bijepi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul said, 'politics is for the public, but today politics is not being used for the public
 raajnneeti kaa istemaal logon ke utthan ke liye nahin balki unhen kuchalane ke liye ho rahaa he
 'he said that many people of the country have become disenchanted with the politics of our time because today politics lacks compassion and truth
 desh ko peeche le ja rahe piem modirahul gandhi ne kaha, 'bharat ko congress 21veen sadi main lekar gaya, lekin aaj pradhanmantri ise madhyayugin kaal main waapas le ja rahe hai
 We are today forced to think that businesses can be built without harmony
 'rahul ne kaha, 'aapke saamne ek udhaaharan he' ek baar agar aag lag jaae to bujhaana mushkil hota he' ham yahi baat bijepi ke logon se kah rahe hai ki agar desh ko aap aag ke hawaale kar dete hai to us par kaabo paanaa mushkil ho jayega
 Today BJP has spread the fire of violence across the country
 'sonia ne kaha-bhay kaa maahaularahul se pehle sonia gandhi ne manch se kaha ki desh main bhay kaa maahaul he
 Congress workers and leaders are not scared
 unhone kaha, 'ham jhukenge nahin
 Our struggle is for the country and we will continue to fight for it
 ham haar nahin maanenge
 "rahul became strong" Sonia said, "if Rahul is my son, i don't think it would be appropriate for me to praise him, but i would like to say that he has suffered from the trauma of violence since childhood
 raajnneeti main aane ke baad se unhen kai nijee hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, jisane unhen or majboot banaaya he
 At the same time, former PM Manmohan Singh said that Rahul is taking command of the post of our party's president at a time when there is turbulent atmosphere in the country's politics

 The difference between perception and truth became clear on 7 December when the Patna High Court quashed the appointment of six Vice Chancellors and four pro-vice Chancellors appointed under their authority as Chancellor of Governor Devananda Konwar
 chif justise rekha em
 Doshit and Justice a
 amanulla kii khandpeeth ne ye niyuktiyaan isliye radd kar deen kyonki governor conwar ne in padon ko bharne se pehle rajya sarkaar se salaah lene kii anivaary prakriya puri nahin kii thi
 The court gave the verdict on the public interest litigation of Ram Tavakya Singh, a teacher at Veer Kunwar Singh University in Ara
 governor ko mila nyaayik aadesh taatkaalik rup se unki chhavi ko dhoomil karne vaala he, lekin yah haar sirf hnnik he or governor conwar ke maamle tak hi simit lag rahi he kyonki isse rajya sarkaar kii tulana main governor kii sthiti or majboot hui he
 The court said in its order, "the Chancellor must seek the opinion of the state government before appointing its elected people to the post of vice-chancellor and Pro vice-chancellor
" rajya sarkaar kii raay ko chancelar manjuur yaa naamanzoor kar saktaa he
 "if the order is read, it seems that the overall effect has been that the governor has benefited for the long term rather than the short-term loss
 isliye achraj kii baat nahin he ki hycourt main apni niyuktiyaan khaarij hone ke baad bhi governor is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti dene kii koi ichha nahin dikhaa rahe kyonki isse niyuktiyon ke maamle main unke varchasv kii phir se pushti ho gai he
 This order has also proved that the Chancellor's decision as the 'supreme Authority' should be final
 aakhir governor conwar court ke faisle se isse behatar kya hasil kar sakate the, jise shuru main har koi unke khilaaf maan rahaa tha
 This order may also compel the state government to cease to interpret the Bihar State University Act and Patna University Act 1976 in its own way
 isse pehle janvari, 2011 main rajya ke maanav sansaadhan vibhaag ne ekatarfa tareeke se 12 naamon kii suchi banaakar chancelar ko bhej di thi ki ve isi sujhai gai suchi main se vaais-chasanlar kii niyukti karen
 The Governor apparently dumped this list of state government names in the garbage cans and on August 1, 2011, appointed six vcs and four pro-vcs of his choice
 bataaya jaataa he ki rajyapal ne vaais chancelar kii niyukti ke maamle main rajya sarkaar ke sifarish karne par kadaa aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Governor Konwar, who has a superior legal mind with experience of practicing law for over a decade in the Guwahati High Court and Supreme Court, seems to have analyzed the specifics of the order
 isi vajah se shaayad unhone chah vaais chancelar ko agle aadesh tak kaam karte rahane kii ijaajat di he
 The court has also issued instructions for new appointments within 30 days to fill the posts of six VC and four pro-vc

 a bhajan was also organized here on this occasion
 31 oktober 1984 main indira gandhi kii dilli main hatya kar di gai thi
 Indira became a member of Congress in 1938 and Prime Minister of the country in 1966
 indira ke kaarykaal main 1975 main desh main apatkaal lagaaya gaya tha
 In the changing room of Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani, a case of sneaking camera has come to light
 smriti ne goa ke faib india ke showrooms main khufia camera pakade jane ke baad police main shikaayat darj karai he
 Goa police have arrested four people and started investigating the case

 At the same time, Parsekar urged people to show their awareness of such incidents
 police ne karrwai karte hue store ko sil kar diya he
 Police said that the police of the northern district has formed a special team to investigate the store
 yah store tateey ilaake main sthit he or isamen suraksha camere ko bahut hi galat sthaan par lagaaya gaya tha
 Superintendent of Police (north Goa) Umesh Gaonkar said that an FIR has been registered under sections 354 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code in connection with the case
 smriti irani ne bhi kalangute police thane main apana bayaan darj karaayaa he
 Goa BJP MLA Michael Lobo has demanded strict action by registering an FIR with the Condolem Police

 police ne maamle main sakhti baratate hue showrooms main video recording kii hard discs jabt kar lee he
 'smriti told husband first' BJP MLA in Goa Michael Lobo said Smriti told her husband first when she came to know about the camera

 The reasons for this failure have not been stated, but the reference is to Aung San Suu Kyi, so it is reasonable that it was a response to the allegations of ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims against the Myanmar army, which has forced millions to flee
 haalanki seemaa suraksha bal ke mahanideshak ke
 K
 sharma kehete hai ki pichley do saal main mahaj 200 rohingya sharnaarthi hi bharat aae hai jinamein sirf 12 ko is saal roka gaya
 The United Nations has said in strong terms that the military's retaliation after the attack is "unequivocal" and cautioned that Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingyas seems to be a "perfect example of ethnic cleansing"
 myanmar se rohingya musalamanon ke palaayan par duniyabar main aakrosh he kyonki pichley paanch saal ke dauraan kareeb paanch lakh log vahaan se bhaage jinamein zyaadaatar bangladesh chale gaye
 However Myanmar has found a friend in the form of India
 sitambar ke pehle saptaah main myanmar yatra ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne su kii se kaha, ''rakhin praant main ugravadi hinsa, khaas taur par suraksha balon ke khilaaf hinsa or iske kaaran maare ja rahe nirdosh logon ke prati aapaki chintaaon ko ham samajhate hai
 "india has maintained good relations with the Myanmar Army in the hope that it will help in action against militants operating in the Northeast
 in aatankwaadiyon me se kai ne myanmar ke jangalon main thikaane bana rakhe hai
 It is not a coincidence that in the last one year, the Indian Army has penetrated into the Myanmar border and conducted operations twice against the rebels operating in the Northeast
 kendriya grih mantralay kii ore se sabhi rajyon ko 8 agast ko bheje gaye patr se yah spasht he ki bharat sarkaar ne 25 agast ko hui hinsa se pehle hi rohingya maamle par apana rukh tay kar liya tha
 The Home Ministry said in that letter that Rohingya are a major threat to the security of migrant India and a burden on the country's limited resources
 iske saath hi prashasan or khufia agenciyon se kaha gaya ki, ''avaidhmyanmar suraksha balon kii yah karrwai muslim ugravadi sanghathan arakaan rohingya salveshan army (earese) ke hamalon ke jawaab main he
 The ARSA attacked several security posts in October 2016, killing several policemen
 phir is saal 25 agast ko bhi uske suniyojit hamale main 12 surakshakarmi maare gaye the
 On both occasions, Myanmar security forces carried out a massive 'cleanliness drive' to root out the ARSA, forcing some 5,00,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh
 pravaasiyon kii pahachaanakar unhen waapas bhejne kii prakriya jaldi shuru karen
 "according to the government, 40,000 Rohingya are living in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, delhi-ncr and Rajasthan
 inamen se zyaadaatar 1982 main myanmar kii naagarikta se vanchit karne ke kanoon ke baad yahaan aae
 According to recent estimates by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 200,000 refugees living in India and India is the 25th largest country in terms of refugee population
 yahaan tamaam tarah ke sharnaarthi hai—1959 main aae tibeti; 1971 main aae bangladeshi; 1963 main aae chakma; 1983, 1989 or phir 1995 main srilanka se aae tamil; or 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan aae afgaan sharnaarthi
 Refugees have come to India from all over the world including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Congo, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria
 2012 main sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv antonio guteras ne sharnaarthiyon ko lekar bharat ke rukh kii prashansa karte hue ise duniyabar ke liye udhaaharan bataaya tha
 This is the first time that the central government has expressed its intention to deport a refugee group
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne unhen 'avaidh apravasi' bataaya he
 However, it is unclear how the government will persuade Myanmar to take back Rohingya Muslims whom it does not consider to be its citizens
 aara trust, centre for rifuji lau and phosred migration studies kii kaaryakari nideshak roshni shankar kahati hai, ''ve log bhavishya main hamaare logon ke liye khatra ho sakate hai, kya mahaj is vajah se ham puure samudaay ko waapas bhejne ja rahe hai jabaki hamen bakhubi pataa he ki waapas lautne par unhen julm kaa shikaar hona padegaa?" ve kahati hai, ''hamane pehle kabhi is tarah kii niti nahin apanaai or yah bhi saaf nahin ki rohingyaon ke khilaaf hi aisa kyon kiya ja rahaa he?"sharnaarthiyon se jude kisi bhi halaat main bharat kii pratikriya kisi sanvaidhanik niti se nahin balki rajnatik vajahon se tay hoti rahi he kyonki bharat duniya ke un kuch deshon main he jahaan na to koi rashtriya sharnaarthi sangrakshan dhaancha he or na hi koi avrajan niti
 We have not even signed the UN Refugee Convention-1951 or its 1967 protocol
 na to hamane 1954 ke yuan kanvension on stateles yaa 1961 ke yuan kanvension on ridction of statelsnes kii hi pushti kii he
 Therefore, India is not bound to give refugees the rights fixed in the said treaties
 vah sharnaarthiyon ko dderghaavadhi vija dene kaa faisla tadarth tareeke se hi letaa he
 Sankara says, "due to such an ad-hoc system, a clear and consistent refugee system could not be created in India and this gave various governments the opportunity to adopt policies according to their political views
" "adhiktar maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon kaa aarope he ki rohingya musalamaanon ke khilaaf bhaajapa kaa rukh suraksha chintaaon kii vajah se nahin, balki muslim virdohi vichaardhaara ke kaaran he
 Irfan Engineer, director of the Mumbai-based Center for Study of Society and Secularism, says, "if the Tamil refugees do not pose a security threat in India while the LTTE recruits a large number of fighters from this community, how can the Rohingya be a threat to security Have become? Can't trust them just because they are Muslims? "people from all neighboring countries except Myanmar demand direct government for asylum in India and issue them the necessary documents to the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) while Myanmar Including all non-neighboring countries are covered under UNHCR
 ayog prayek vyakti ke sharan sambandhi aavedan ke moolyankan ke baad aavedak se poochtacha karata he or panjikaran ke liye biomitric data lene ke baad hi sharnaarthi ke rup main aaidi card jari karata he
 This entire process takes six months to a year
 sarkaar philhal rohingya samet yuanechasiaar aaidi prahrashwat sabhi sharnaarthiyon ko 'lambii avadhi ke vija' ke liye aavedan karne kii ijaajat detii he or har maamle par alag-alag faisla kiya jaataa he
 Says Shankar, "UNHCR is allowed to operate only from New Delhi and unfortunately not every refugee (including Rohingya) is able to formally seek asylum as they have Delhi while their applications are being evaluated
 There is no way to come
 " yahi kaaran he ki desh main rah rahe 40,000 rohingya musalamaanon main se mahaj 16,500 yuanechasiaar main panjikrut hai
 In order to make the settlement of refugees more orderly, the government proposed an amendment to the Citizenship Act of 1955
 pichley saal july main centre sarkaar ne naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak sansad main pesh kar diya
 It said that illegal migrants from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian denomination who were victims of religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan would be allowed to come in and be neither imprisoned nor sent back
 
 haalanki is vidheyak main muslim sharnaarthiyon ko shaamil nahin rohingya ke prati apni maanviya jimmedaari se pallaa nahin chhudaa saktaa
 Professor Surya Dev of the School of Law of the City University of Hong Kong agrees, having been nominated by the United Nations Human Rights Council as an advisor to its working groups on the issue of human rights, multinational corporations and other business ventures
 ve kehete hai, ''antarrashtriya halkon main hindustan kii badhati aarthik or siyaasi haisiyat ke anuroop use nishchit taadaad main rohingya musalamaanon ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 "the Center's conflicting stance on the issue of refugees also came to light when the same Central Government on 14 September sent humanitarian aid to Bangladesh to help deal with the Rohingya floods
 shankar kehete hai, ''ham bangladesh ko aarthik sahaayta muhaiyaa karne ko taiyaar hai par khud apni simaaon ke bheetar aisa karne kii aarthik vyaavhaarikta ko lekar phikrmand hai
 "although human rights agencies and activists have criticized the government for trying to identify all Rohingya Muslims as suspected terrorists, there is also considerable evidence that jihadi groups around the world have taken advantage of this crisis
 yahaan tak ki sanyukt raashtra sharnaarthi ucchayog (yuanessiaar) main darj sharnaarthi bhi khatra ban sakate hai, yah aktubar 2016 main jaahir ho gaya jab bangladesh main nayapada sharnaarthi shivi ke bheetar madad ke liye banaai gai ansaar police chaiki par hamalaa bol diya gaya
 The attack was carried out by a person named Nurul Awasar alias Ruhullah, who was registered as a refugee in the camp
 yahi vajah he ki bangladesh main bharat kii purv ucchayukta veena sikri rohingya ko waapas bhejne ke sarkaar ke faisle kii himaayat karti hai or kahati hai ki hindustan main rohingyaon ko earese ke haathon kattar banaae jane kii puri ashanka he
 The ARSA said in a statement issued on September 14 that it had no relationship with Al Qaeda, ISIS, lashkar-e-taiba or any other terror group
 suraksha vishleshak or aatankwaad visheshgy is par bharosa karne ko raji nahin hai, kyonki international chrysis group (isiji) kii 2016 kii ek report kahati he ki earese kaa netaa ataullah abu ammaar junajuni urf hafiz tohaar karachi main paidaa hua tha or saudi arab ke ek madrase main gaya tha
 Even his patron Abdus Qadus Burmese, another Pakistani of Rohingya descent, also attended meetings with Lashkar's leader Hafiz Saeed
 isiji ke mutabik, earese kii aguai saudi arab main rohingya pravaasiyon kii ek samiti karti he or yah aarthik taur par majboot or kaaphi sangathit maaloom detii he
 On September 17, a special cell of Delhi Police arrested Sameeon Rahman, a man working for Al Qaeda
 28 baras kaa yah british naagarik rohingya musalamaanon kii bhartee karke purvi bharat main ek aatanki modul sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 This is not the first time that Rohingya Muslims' association with al Qaeda has come to the fore
 9 / 11 ke baad america phujon ko aise kai video mili, jinamein afghanistan sthiti al kaayda ke shiviron main kiya gaya yaa na hi ise nepal, myanmar or srilanka sareekhe duusare padosi deshon tak badhaayaa gaya
 This was the first indication of the anti-government stance on Rohingya refugees in India
 bangladesh se aae 'avaidh hindu ghuspaithiyon' kaa boj uthaane se inkaar kar chuke assam main jabardast janaakrosh or virodh ke baad ab ek sanyukt sansadeey samiti is vidheyak kii padtaal kar rahi he
 In support of the bill, BJP leader and Assam Finance Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma even claimed that Assamese Hindus needed 1,50,000 'illegal Bengali Hindus' to counter the 55 lakh 'illegal Muslim infiltrators' in the state
 haalanki ye aadhikarik aankade nahin hai, par bhaajapa netaa kii yah ajeebogareeb daleel rohingya sharnaarthiyon ke khilaaf is aam shikaayat ko bemaani bana detii he ki ve hamaare aarthik sansadhano par boj hai
 Supreme Court lawyer Upamanyu Hazarika says, "if 40,000 Rohingya are a financial burden on us, imagine 1
 5 lakh hindu bangladeshi assam sareekhe ek rajya ko kitna nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Why only the Rohingya, the government should also expel all the intruders from Bangladesh who have entered India for economic reasons
 "dilli sthit bhartiya maanavadhikaar santhaan ke diarector rahul raaj ke mutabik, hindustan jimmedaar vaishvik takat hone ke naate myanmar ke jehadi prashikshan hasil kar rahe the
 In 2013, when the UPA was in power, Delhi Police's interrogation of Khali Mehmood, a man working for the so-called Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO), also revealed evidence of Rohingya militants' involvement with Pakistan
 maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta yah to maanate hai ki 'raashtra virdohi' kaamon main mubtila kisi bhi videshi ke khilaaf karrwai karnaa sarkaar ke adhikaar main he, par unhen lagata he ki puure samudaay ko dehshatgard qaraar de dena ninsaphi he
 Deva says, "if certain Rohingyas have solid information about their involvement in terrorist activities, then they should stop the admission and send it back
" magar puure tabake ke logon par suraksha ke liye sambhavit khatra hone kaa thahreshwapa laga dena nazaij he
 The government can of course maintain a better system of investigation
 "8 agast ke aadesh ke baad hindustan main rah rahe do rohingya sharnaarthiyon—mohammad salimullah or mohammad shakir—ne supreme court main yachika daakhil karke sarkaar se yah aashwaasan dene kii maang kii ki unhen myanmar waapas nahin bheja jayega
 The names of both these refugees are recorded in the UNHCR
 jawaab main sarkaar ne 16 sitambar ko 16 pannon kaa ek halafanama daakhil kiya jisamen kaha gaya ki sarkaar 'ugravadi guton' ke saath rohingyaon ke judaav or avaidh raaston se rakam aane ke saboot pesh karegi
 The affidavit also stated that the government has evidence gathered from security agencies and other trusted sources which suggest that some Rohingya migrants have links with terrorist organizations operating from Pakistan and similar organizations operating from other countries
 Huh
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki sampradayik or phirakaveran khoonkhraba bhadakaane kii iageies or duusare ''ugravadi guton" kii sajishon main rohingya ke shaamil hone kii suchanaaen bhi hai
 In the retaliatory petition, those two Rohingya migrants said they were "not just illegal migrants" as they fled Myanmar amid fierce repression and slaughter
 isse unhen non-rifoulment yaa gaiyr-vaapasi ke usul par aadhaarit kai antarrashtriya sandhiyon ke tahat hifaazat kaa haq mil jaataa he
 According to the principle of non-refoulement or non-return, no person seeking asylum can be sent back to a country where their "race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or life due to political opinion" Or threaten independence
 "haalanki hindustan ne 1951 kii sanyukt raashtra sharnaarthi sandhi par dastakhat nahin kiye hai, par yuanechasiaar ne dilli main ek bayaan main kaha ki non-rifoulment kaa siddhant prachlit antarrashtriya kanoon kaa hissaa he or sabhi deshon par lagu hota he, phir bhale hi unhone sandhi par dastakhat kiye hon yaa nahin
 In its affidavit to the apex court, the central government claimed that it was not bound to uphold this principle as it did not include the civil and political rights that India signed on international agreements
 iske alaava, yahaan tak ki 1951 kii sandhi ke tahat bhi non-rifoulment kii niti berokatoke nahin he balki us par rashtriya suraksha kii chintaaon kii paabandiyaan lagu hai
 However, due to the worldwide criticism and pressures within the country — the National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs on August 18 about the decision to repatriate Rohingya refugees — the government was forced to soften its stand 
 kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju kehete hai, ''hamane rajyon se kaha he ki tamaam avaidh pravaasiyon kaa pataa lagaaein or sthapit prakriyaaon ke tahat karrwai karen
 There is no talk of any particular community in this
 " india today ko die ek likhit bayaan main yuanechaarsi ne kaha ki use sharnaarthiyon ke mudde par sarkaar ke rukh main kisi badlaav ko lekar uski ore se koi aadhikarik soochna nahin mili he or yuanechasiaar main darj rohingya ko bharat se nikaalane ke kisi maamalon kii bhi koi soochna nahin he
 Many people who watch the case believe that the government's tough stand against Rohingya may have its roots in "economic and diplomatic" reasons and has nothing to do with its "communal perspective"
 
 myanmar ne 2011 main sudhaaron ko anjaam dekar desh ko videshi nivesh ke liye khol diya
 The coastal region of Rakhine province has acquired strategic importance for both India and China, as both these countries have been trying to increase their geopolitical dominance

 Political experts believe that instead of falling behind the Rohingya, the government of India should use its global status to pressure Myanmar to create an environment in which the Rohingya can return

 lakhanu ke do saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne echesbisi ke khilaaf steverland main bank khaaton main kalaadhan rakhane ke aaropon par bhartiya rigerv bank se sampark kiya he
 The activists said that they had written a letter to the Reserve Bank about this after HSBC had earlier dismissed all the allegations made in their complaint
 unhone echesbisi dwaara pehali shikaayat ke jawaab kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki echesbisi ne kaha he ki vah jahaan bhi parichaalan karata he, kanoon kaa gambhirtha se anupaalan karata he
 Through a new senior global leadership team and a new strategy last year, HSBC has taken concrete steps to tighten compliance
 kaaryaktaaon kaa kahana he ki echesbisi india kaa jawaab tab aayaa jab rigerv bank ne use shikaayat par gaur karne ko kaha
 He has again sent a complaint to the Reserve Bank as the original issue of his complaint was not answered

 The matter of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been stuck for the last 15 years due to one political bottleneck, during which it has been debated, discussed and reviewed in every way

 Clearly, the insignificant shadows are not being removed by this important tax reform
 lihaaja, atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar kaa sabase pehle san 2000 main laayaa gaya jiesti kar vidheyak na sirf narendra modi sarkaar kii tay kii gai april 2016 kii samaysima se chook jayega, balki visheshgyon ne india today se andeshaa jataayaa ki ab yah aktubar 2017 tak latak saktaa he
 There are several reasons for this disappointing trend
 inamen ek to yah he ki sarkaar ko parampara ke mutabik gaiyr-endie sadasyon main se hi mani kaa vikalp chunanaa hoga
 After that, a two-thirds majority would be needed to get the Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha
 endie isse saat sadsy peeche he kyonki congress, vam dal or eiediemke vidheyak ke khilaaf hai
 Then, after a landslide victory in Bihar, the support of 12 Rajya Sabha members of the JD (U), who had earlier supported the bill, is also not guaranteed
 utani hi jaruri is kar sudhaar par amal karne ke liye vishesh praudyogiki vyavastha or in karon ko sweekaar karne ke liye sabhi audyogic or seva kshetron kii taiyaari bhi hogi
 States such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, which produce a wide range of commodities, are already in a rage at the prospect that they will be deprived of the tax on goods produced in their state
 gujarat ne vidheyak main upbhog ke thikaane par aadhaarit kar vyavastha kaa virodh kiya he
 In this system, mainly "consuming" states such as West Bengal can benefit from GST revenue share while "producing" states may incur a loss in tax revenue
 centre ne kathith taur par gujarat ko do saal tak samaan jiesti hissedari ke alaava kar rajasav main ek pratishat atirikt kar rajasav dene par rajamandi jaahir kii he
 But he is not yet able to express his consent on this
 arthvyavastha ko phaaydajisti ke kriyanvayan ko desh kii arthvyavastha ko laabh pahunchane vaale akele sabase bade sudhaar ke rup main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa tha
 Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Industries, believes, “through GST, we will be able to double the rate of growth in the country and other things will automatically improve
 ” iskaa buniyadi vichaar yah he ki arthvyavastha ko majboot karne ke liye ek sanyukt, sahyogi or avibhajit bhartiya bazaar khadaa kiya jaae
 Sachin Menon, head of indirect tax at consulting firm KPMG, says, "once GST is implemented, every deal will fall under this tax regime
" ” is vakt kai logon ke liye kar se bachanaa aasaan ho jaataa he kyonki ve centre va rajya ke alag-alag adhikaar kshetron main aate hai
 It is also seen as a strong weapon to tackle black money
 kai log jiesti kii dar ko 20 fisadi tay karne par jor de rahe hai, vaise congress ise 18 fisadi karne ke paksh main he
 In earlier consultations between the Center and the states, the opinion of setting the GST rate at 25 to 26 percent was expressed
 lekin visheshgyon kaa kahana tha ki yah dar jiesti kii mul avadharana ko hi nuksaan pahunchane vaali thi
 Ajit Ranade, chief economist at Aditya Birla Group, says, "the GST law should avoid setting a fixed rate and simply state that the rate will be competitive and in line with international standards and the idea of revenue neutrality
 ” daron ke alaava congress vidheyak main kuch or badlaav bhi chaahati he, jisamen nagarpalikaon or panchayaton ke liye muaavje kii vyavastha or swatantra vivaad nibatara pranali kaa gathan shaamil he
 How expensive can GST delay be? In any such tax reform of such a wide scale, it is not that from the very first day there will be a significant increase in tax collection
 haalanki, kai logon kaa anumaan he ki kar sangrah main 30 se 40 fisadi kii badhotaree ho jaaegi
 This corresponds to the same increase when states adopted VAT in 2003 excluding sales tax
 april se agast 2015 main bharat kaa paroksh kar sangrah 54,396 karod rupye tha jo atirikt rajasav upayon ke kaaran utpaada shulk main vruddhi ke parinamswaroop pichley saal kii tulana main 37 fisadi zyada rahaa
 After the implementation of GST, it will increase further
 sarkaar ke liye seva kar atirikt aay badhaane kaa ek saadhan he or agar use kriyanvit nahin kiya jaataa to utpaada shulk kii daren bad sakati hai or rajya sarkarein rajasav main hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye cells tex badha sakati hai
 Impact on consumers but the biggest loss will be the consumers themselves
 jiesti se upabhokta vastuon kii ausat keemton main 1
 a reduction of 5 to 2 per cent is expected
 hamaare upbhog kaa kareeb 70 fisadi khaane, kapadon or baaki upabhokta vastuon par kharch hota he or sirf 30 fisadi upbhog sevaaon par
 After the implementation of GST, the production tax, which is currently 28 per cent, will come down to 20 per cent and the service tax, which is currently 14 per cent, will reach 20 per cent
 salaahkaar form grant thornton india ke partner or paroksh kar ke pramukh amit kumaar sarkaar kaa kahana he, “desh ke upabhoktaaon ko isse sidhe-sidhe 3 se 5 fisadi phayda hoga
 "this can reduce inflationary pressures, encouraging middle class people to spend more, and lower the GDP rate by at least 1
 5 se 2 fisadi kaa badhaava mil saktaa he
 Many people also say that the government should increase the scope of taxation of GST and bring more and more goods and services under its purview
 jaisaa ki kuch reporton main kaha ja rahaa he, petroleum utpaadon, bijli or real estate ko isse baahar rakhane se jiesti kaa uddeshy kaaphi had tak naakaam ho saktaa he
 The government claims that a technological framework has been devised to implement this tax
 paanch saal ke liye jiesti technology network taiyaar karne or uski dekharekh ke liye 1,380 karod ru
 The agreement has already been given to software company Infosys
 sarkaar ne jiesti network ke naam se ek sanstha bhi banaai he, jo jiesti ko lagu karne ke liye praudyogikeey aadhaar kaa kaam karegi or centre tathaa rajyon ke databes ko aapas main jodygi
 All that remains now is to mobilize the support of the opposition to get the GST Bill passed, but the government has so far failed, especially in the case of Land Acquisition Bill
 ranade kehete hai ki congress or bijepi ko deshhit main aapasi sahmati kaayam kerani chahie kyonki donon partiyaan kendriya bikri kar ke evaj main ek fisadi ke muaavje par pehle hi rajamand ho chuki hai
 This condition was one of the alleged preconditions of the Congress
 yah un rajyon ke liye behad sakaaratmak baat he jinhen achche-khaase rajasav nuksaan kaa dar he
 Anyway GST was on the agenda of the UPA government but then it was stuck due to opposition from BJP
 ab congress bhi yahi ravaiya apana rahi he
 But the real problem is being told about the attitude of the NDA government
 vaise ab sarkaar sabhi pramukh vipakshi dalon ke netaaon kii baithak bulaane kii yojana bana rahi he taaki mahatvapurn vidheyakon or sansad ke kaamkaaj par charchaa kii ja sake
 It is welcome vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki ve vidheyak par jari gatirodh ko dur karne ke liye congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi samet kisi se bhi baatcheet ko taiyaar hai
 He also claimed in an interview on 16 November that the government had the necessary legislation in the House to pass the bill, "the day it will be discussed and voted in the Rajya Sabha, i have absolutely no doubt that it Will be approved
 sankhya hamaare paksh main he
 "of course, these are bold words that will be tested soon

 isi kram main tejasvi yadav buudhvaar ko nitish kumaar sarkaar ke khilaaf ek report card jari karenge or sarkaar kii vifaltaaon ko ginavaayenge
 It is believed that the biggest issue that Tejashwi Yadav will present against the Nitish government will be the biggest issue in the recent communal riots in Bihar, due to which Nitish Kumar is getting very dirty
 17 march ko bhagalpur main shuru hue sampradayik dange or uske baad ramanavami ke parv ke baad pradesh ke takreeban 8 jilon main faili sampradayik hinsa ke mudde ko lekar tejasvi yadav mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko gherenge
 Significantly, in 2005, when Nitish Kumar took charge of Bihar as the Chief Minister, the incident of communal riots in Bihar was never heard between 2017
 magar pichley saal bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan karke phir se sarkaar banane ke baad se pradesh main sampradayik hinsa ke kai maamle saamne aae hai
 In the report card, Tejashwi Yadav can discuss about how Nitish Kumar has succumbed to BJP and RSS
 jisaki vajah se pradesh main lagaataar sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaayen hoti ja rahi he or sushasan kaa daawa karne vaale nitish aisi ghatnaon ko rokane main naakaamayaab dikh rahe hai
 Apart from the incidents of communal violence, recently, the Supreme Court will also speak out against the change in the law on the Scheduled Castes and Tribes
 Atrocities against Dalits have increased
 report card main tejasvi yadav bihar sarkaar ke pichley 8 maheene ke ham apana kaamkaaj kaa bhi lekha jokha pesh karenge
 Tejashwi Yadav will also mention in the report card about the manner in which many scams have come to light in the last few months in the state
 srijan ghotaalaa, shauchalay ghotaalaa, dustbin ghotaalaa, chaatravrutti ghotaalaa kaa zikr report karnaa hoga
 Tejashwi Yadav will also raise the issue of not giving special state status to Bihar till now
 tejasvi yadav pradesh main dabl ingine kii sarkaar banane ke baavjood vikaas nahin hone ke mudde ko bhi jor shor se uthaaenge or is baat kaa zikr karenge ki dabl ingine kii sarkaar hone ke baavjood bhi bihar ko ab tak vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin mila he

 The settlement efforts in the Ayodhya issue have received a major setback as the four top contenders, Nirmohi Akhara, VHP, Hindu Mahasabha and Sunni Central Waqf Board, who are facing litigation on both sides, have denied any compromise
 nirmohi akhaade or viechpi ne to kaha he ki unka dawa puri vivaadit zamin par he, isliye vahaan mandir or masjid donon unhen qubul nahin
 It is known that Mahant Gyanandas, the Mahant of Hanuman Garhi in Ayodhya and the national president of Nirmohi Akhara and Hashim Ansari, the eldest purveyors of the Babri Masjid case, offered to raise a 100 feet wall between the adjacent ground mosque and the disputed land
 mahant gyaandas us akhaada parishad ke adhyaksh hai, jiskaa nirmohi akhaada sadsy he
 So he was offering this on behalf of the Nirmohi Akhara
 1961 main jis vaqt mulk main "dharmaputra" film kaa gaanaa, "yah masjid he or vah butakhaana, chaahe yah maano, chaahe vah maano superhit hua tha, usee saal chaar muslim pairokaron ne babari masjid ke malikana haq kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 They said that idols have been kept in the mosque
 vah masjid he butakhaana nahin
 For years, it has not been decided whose prayer is there
 samjhauta vaarta kii khabaren aate hi us par har taraf se tikhi pratikriyaayein aane lageen
 Mahant Ramdas of the Nirmohi Akhara said, "any attempt at compromise can only be made between the three people to whom the High Court has given a third of the disputed land in its judgment
" chunki yah zamin nirmohi akhaade, ramalala virajman kii taraf se viechpi or sunni central vaqf board ko mili he isliye sirf vahi koi samjhauta kar sakate hai, mahant gyaandas nahin
 And since our claim is of the temple on the whole land, we cannot make any agreement to build both the temple and the mosque there
 " VHP also came in this case, its Union Minister Purushottam Narayan Singh has also said that the entire land belongs to Ramlala so there can be no agreement on it
 udhar, sunni central vaqf board ke vakil jafarayab jilani kaa kahana he ki "iske pehle jitani baar bhi adaalat se baahar samjhaute kii koshishen hui hai, har baar mandir paksh ne yahi maang rakhi ki masjid ke daavedaar apana daawa chhod den, aise main samjhaute kaa koi sawaal nahin, adaalat jo bhi faisla degi hamen manjuur hoga
 " udhar, hindu mahasabha ke rashtriya pravaktaa pramod pandit joshi ne mumbai se hamen bataaya ki ve bhi puri zamin mandir ke liye chaahate hai, isliye mahasabha is tarah kaa koi samjhauta nahin chaahati

 bharat main mausam ke aadhaar par baante gaye 36 prakhandon main se 11 main is saal 1 june se 3 sitambar ke bich 20 se 59 fisadi kam varsha hui jo saamaanya monsoon ke shuruaati teen maheenon main apekshit varsha se kaaphi kam he
 Union Minister of State for Geology Jitendra Singh announced on August 12 that the monsoon rains this year are the weakest in the last five years, which will be 87 per cent of the long-term average (LPA)
 alpie 1951 se 2000 ke bich desh main hui mausami barsaat kaa ausat aankada hota he jo anumaan ke mutabik 89 fisadi he
 It was forecast to be 93 percent in June
 is ghoshnaa ke baad desh kii us 83 karod aabaadi ke kaan khadey ho gaye jo krishi par nirbhar he
 55 percent of the cropped land receives 90 percent of the rainfall from the southwest monsoon, which is dependent on rainfall for irrigation
 ab jaraa is baat par dhyaan den
 The biggest drought in India was in 1877
 us vakt desh main 29 fisadi kam barish hui thi
 This decrease occurred during 2002 when there was a drought 19
 2 fisadi thi, jabaki 2009 main jab sookhaa padaa tha tab 21
 8 percent less rainfall
 bharat kaa mausam vibhaag monsoon kii sthiti ko samajhne ke liye kisi kshetra par hui mausami barsaat ko naapta he or us kshetra main monsoon ke alpie ke anupaat main isaki gananaa karata he
 The question arises that how bad is this year's monsoon? Scientist M
 in the Ministry of Geosciences
 rajivan kehete hai, ‘‘samooche bharat kii baat karen to 10 fisadi kam varsha ko sookhaa padana mana jaataa he
 In a weather-based block, this standard is 19 percent
 ’’vigyaan or praudyogiki vibhaag main jalwaayu parivartan kaarykram ke pramukh akhilesh gupta kehete hai, ‘‘agar barish 25 fisadi tak kam hui ho to sookhaa halke darje kaa mana jaataa he
 If the rainfall deficiency is more than 25 per cent but less than 50 per cent, then it means the drought is of medium quality
 lekin barish main kami 50 fisadi se bhi zyada he to iskaa matlab he ki sookhe kii sthiti gambhir he
 '' 622 in the country till 3 September this year
 5 millimetre (mili) barish hui he jo 734
 15 per cent less than the normal figure of 7 ml
 haalanki sarkaar ne ab tak ise sookhaa ghoshit nahin kiya he or ise barish main kami hi qaraar de rahi he
 But according to the meteorological department's own standard, the country is still in drought
 mausam kaa purvanumaan lagane vaali noida sthit nijee agency scymet ke siio jatin singh hairaani jataate hue kehete hai, ‘‘yah ajeeb baat he ki alpie se 13 fisadi kam barish par bhi sarkaar ise sookhe kaa naam nahin de rahi
 However, says Shivanand Pai, head of the long-term forecast department of the Meteorological Department, Pune, "the season is not over yet so one should not make any hasty conclusions
" ’’ agar mausam ke aadhaar par baante gaye prakhandon ko dekhen to inamen se 21 main saamaanya varsha hui he or varsha main kami 19 fisadi se zyada nahin rahi he
 According to Gupta, this distribution of rainfall deficiency on a geographical basis is inherent in the monsoon
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘isamen kai tantra hote hai, jaise madhya bhaag main kam dabaav kaa kshetra, gujarat or saurashtra main mid-tropospherick ghumaav, pashchimi tat par tateey bhanvaren tathaa uttari bharat main pashchimi vikshobh ityadi, jinke chalate barish hoti he
 These systems are manufactured in different places at different times
 kuch varshon main ye aanshik ho sakate hai yaa puri tarah gaayab bhi rah sakate hai or kabhi-kabhaar inaki sankhya zyada ho sakati he
 This is the reason why there is no monsoon rain everywhere at all times
 ’’kya ham varsha par nirbhar rah sakate hai?haal ke varshon main 2002, 2004 or 2009 ke dauraan kharaab monsoon ke kaaran is tantra ke tikaoo hone ko lekar sawaal khadey hue hai
 According to Professor Devraj Sikka, former director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, between 1960 and 2010, the average monsoon rainfall has decreased by five per cent
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘1994 ke baad ek bhi saal aisa nahin rahaa jab atirikt varsha hui ho
 Only last year we saw more rain than usual
 ’’in asaamaanya ruzanon ke baavjood vaigyanik ab tak maanate rahe hai ki monsoon tantra bahut kargar he chunki yah parighatna har saal lagbhag ek hi samay ke kareeb lagaataar ghatati he
 Not once in the last 150 years, monsoon has failed
 kerala main monsoon ke aagaman kii ausat taarikh 1 june rahi he lekin beete 100 saal ke dauraan samay se bahut pehle hi 1918 main 11 may ko or 1972 main yah 18 june ko kerala pahunchaa tha

 The worst drought in the country occurred in 1877 when it received 29 percent less rainfall
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki kam-se-kam 70 fisadi barish to hameshaa honi hi he
 In addition, normal rainfall has been seen in the last 150 years in 70 percent of the period
 ’’monsoon ke aagaman se kahin zyada ahm haalanki uskaa sakriy (jab barish jari rahati he) or supt rahane vaala charan he (jab barish ruk jaati he)
 a normal cycle is 40 days, but it has been more than a decade when this cycle has been healthy in India - either continuous rain or continuous drought

 ek hi mausam main barish kaa itnaa asmaan vitaran khatarnaak he
 According to Swadhin Bahera, Group Leader, CVPARG, Application Laboratory of Tokyo-based Jamstech, if the dormant phases of the monsoon are longer than its active phases, the country experiences a drought-like situation
 kuch aisa hi hamane 2002 main dekha tha
 Is global warming the cause? a report released in 2013 by scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says that the global monsoon trend will change due to global warming in the future
 vaigyanikon ne paaya he ki ek degree celcius kii garmi ke chalate bharat main rojaanaa kii barish main 4 se 12 fisadi tak badlaav aa saktaa he
 Pai and his colleagues are still not keen on the effects of global warming, but they believe that there may be some impact on the level of weather-based blocks
 pai kehete hai, ‘‘vibhinn adhyayanon main hamane yah paaya he ki ikkisvin sadi ke uttararddh main mausami monsooni barish aaj kii sthiti se bahut alag nahin hogi haalanki sakriy or supt charnon kii tivrata or avadhi main badlaav aa saktaa he
 "he warns that due to the uncertainty associated with larger models, such assessments emerge
" ve kuch kshetron main barish ke rujhaanon main badlaav kii ore ishaara bhi karte hai
 For example, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Northeastern states and Kerala have seen a decrease in rainfall during the last 50 years whereas West Bengal, western Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Rayalaseema, coastal Andhra Pradesh and northern Karnataka are in the interior
 Rain has increased in the areas
 madhya bharat main barish kii tivrata or barambharataa main bhi ijapha hua he
 At the same time, there has been a decrease in moderate rainfall, which did not change the average rainfall figures
 sikaa kehete hai, ‘‘global varming se baari barish main kami aa sakati he or kam der ke liye halki barsaat ke maamle bad sakate hai
 "el-nino's Impact on the Monsoon" The rise in the Pacific Ocean's surface temperature close to South America is called the el-nino effect and is believed to be associated with below-average rainfall in India
 agast main mausam vibhaag ne kamjor al-nino rahane kii 50 fisadi sambhavyata kaa purvanumaan jataayaa tha
 Subsequently, on 12 August, Australia's Meteorological Department said that there were some signs of renewed development of el-nino in the Pacific Ocean
 gupta ke mutabik, asmaan monsoon ke peeche beshak al-nino ek kaaran he
 Former Director of Meteorological Department P
 ve
 Joseph agrees, "recent research has shown that the year el-nino is strong, the dormant phases in monsoon rains are longer than normal
 ’’1901 se 2011 ke bich 20 baar pade sookhe main 13 yaa kahen 65 fisadi kaa sambandh al-nino se rahaa he
 Though Rajeevan admits that half of al-nino is related to drought, he does not see such a direct relationship between the two
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘al-nino kaa asar uski tivrata, samay or samudr ke garm hone ke bhugolic vitaran par nirbhar karata he
 Pai believes that in recent years, the relationship between el-nino and the monsoon in the Indian subcontinent has weakened
 ve bataate hai, ‘‘iskaa badhibia udhaaharan is sadi ke do bade al-nino hai jo 1982-83 or 1997-98 main aae
 The first one suffered a dangerous drought while the second one received slightly more rain than usual
 ’’al-nino se muqablamajboot al-nino ke baavjood 1997 main saamaanya se zyada barish hone kii paheli ko 1999 main indian osian dypole (iodi) kii khoj ke saath sulajhaa liya gaya
 The eastern end of the Indian Ocean, close to Indonesia and the western end of the African coast, also have an El Nino-like effect
 samudr ke garam hone kii yah parighatna hind mahaasaagar ke vishuvatiya kshetra main april-may se shuru hoti he or aktubar main apni oonchai par pahunchati he
 This type of IOD has two phases - one positive and one negative
 sakaaratmak charan ke dauraan arab sagar garm hota he or bharat main zyada varsha hoti he
 In the negative phase exactly the reverse happens
 baheda kehete hai, ‘‘sakaaratmak iodi se al-nino kaa prabhaav kam hota he or yah saamaanya monsoon ko sthapit karne main madad detaa he
 This year though a positive IOD will probably start in October when the monsoon season is over
 kya ham monsoon ke achche daur main hai?joseph ke mutabik, dashak-dar-dashak monsoon kii barish main hone vaale badlaav ko do chakree daur main baanta ja saktaa he-shushk or ardra
 For example, the three decades between 1901 and 1930 and the three decades between 1961 and 1990 were periods of drought
 sookhe ke is daur main aath monsoon varshavihin rahe jabaki teen monsoon ativrishti vaale rahe
 Similarly, during the three decades of 1871 to 1900 and 1931 to 1960, the drought was minor, which came once every 15 years
 joseph bataate hai, ‘‘is tarah 1871 se 1990 ke bich 120 varshon ke dauraan shushk or ardra ke do chakra 30-30 saal par badal-badal kar aate rahe
 That is, the period between 1991 and 2020 is a period of humid cycle and that is why in the last 23 years we have had drought only three times in 2002, 2004 and 2009
 haalanki sthitiyaan tab kaaphi mushkil ho jaaengi jab ham 2021 se sookhe ke chakra main pravesh karenge
 "shocking coexistence
 Some sporadic events like the 2013 floods in Uttarakhand or the Delhi rains in 2010 have drawn special attention to the peculiar relationship between the monsoon and the Western Disturbance
" pashchim se purab kii ore aane vaali sukhi or thandi hawaaen jo uttar se hokar guzarati hai or himalayan kshetra or usase lage hue maidaanon ko prabhavit karti hai, unhen pashchimi vikshobh kehete hai
 These winds have a mixed effect on the monsoon
 monsoon ke dauraan pashchimi vikshobh himalayan kshetra main barish ko badhaata he, khaskar uttar-pashchimi bharat ke ilaakon main isse zyada barish hoti he
 For the rest of India, however, western disturbances mean the arrival of dry and cool winds that weaken the monsoon
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik, monsoon kii lahar jab uttari bharat par majboot hoti he to yah pashchimi vikshobh ko roke rakhti he
 If western disturbance passes through northern India in this phase, the mutual action of both can cause heavy rains
 gupta kehete hai, ‘‘dilli or uttarakhand main darasal yahi hua tha
 The same phenomenon is also responsible for heavy rains in Uttar Pradesh this year
 ’’monsoon arabi shabd ‘‘mausim’’ se aayaa he jiskaa arth he hawaaon ke rukh main mausami badlaav
 For years, scientists have been trying to understand this strange phenomenon
 jaahir he, sadiyon se bina naga har saal palat kar aane vaala monsoon tikaoo to he lekin isamen antarnihit badlaav ab bhi vaigyanikon ke liye chunauti bana hua he
 So many diverse environmental factors, from the Himalayan snow to the anticipated El Nino and unpredictable IOD, are driven by the fact that it is still a long time to say a final word about the monsoon

 dilli ke purv mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal aakhirkaar jahaan se chale the, waapas vahiin aa gaye
 Kejriwal finally recovered his belongings from the government residence at Tilak Lane in central Delhi, where he had come to live as the Chief Minister of Delhi in January
 arvind kejariwal ab apane puure parivaar ke saath vaapis girnaar apartment, kaushambi, ghaziabad upi ke usee flats main laut gaye hai jahaan se vah aae the
 Arvind Kejriwal has been paying rent of Rs 85,000 every month since his resignation from the government in February, raising questions on the government housing citing morality, why Kejriwal is not vacating the government house if not CM
 pehle kejariwal chunaav main vyast the, baad main unhone beti kii pariksha kaa hawala diya or jab pariksha bhi ho gai to samasya saamne ai ki unako dilli main makaan hin nahin mil rahaa tha
 a house was found in Mayur Vihar, but did not have to do it later because there was illegal construction in that house
 dilli ke civil lines main ek makaan ko kiraye par lene kii deal aadhikarik taur par ho bhi gai, lekin baad main vah do bhaaiyon ke property vivaad main funs gaya or kejariwal usase peeche hat gaye
 Actually, there was some other reason why Arvind Kejriwal could not find a rented house in Delhi for his family
 pehla yah ki arvind kejariwal ko dhyaan rakhana tha ki jahaan vah rahen wo jagah aasaani se pahunchane laayak ho
 Also, the people and the environment around it should be such that people do not have problems if there is congestion
 arvind ke parivaar main kul chah sadsy hai isliye 3−4 kamaron kaa makaan anivaary tha
 It is also a matter of fact that Kejriwal is now a chief as well as a party chief and also an MLA from the prestigious New Delhi Assembly seat, so he must also keep an office at home for which there should be space
 or sabase badi baat makaan aisa ho ki kejariwal ko aalochana kaa shikaar na hona pade
 Now in so many conditions, disputes and circumstances, Kejriwal could not find a rented house in Delhi at least and returned to where he had come from
 ye flats kejariwal kii iares patni ke naam par aavantit hua he or pehle bhi aise hi tha, vaise unke kareebi unke kaushambi nivas ko unke liye shubh maanate hai kyonki vahiin rahakar unhone soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon, lokapal andolan jaise muddon par kaam kiya jisase unako khub shoharat mili
 Aam Aadmi Party formed
 party nen pehali hi baar main 28 seat jitkar sabko chaunkaaya or dekhte hi dekhte kejariwal dilli ke siem ban gaye
 Whereas after going to Tilak Lane, criticism, controversy prevailed and resignations from the government, events like the party's debacle in the Lok Sabha caused Kejriwal and the party's morale and confidence in the public
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki kya waapas kaushambi, upi main lautnaa kejariwal ke liye shubh hoga? The state president gave the instructions to Beniwal, BJP was able to contest the elections alone, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had entered the fray in alliance with the National Democratic Party (RLP) in the Lok Sabha elections
 ab pradesh main nikaay chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 There was speculation about the future of the alliance among the statements made by Hanuman Beniwal of RLP
 in sabake bich bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh doctorastish puniyane spasht kiya he ki party akele chunaav ladane main sakasham he
 He said that the party will contest the elections alone
 aralapi se gathbandhan nahin kiya jayega
 Dr
 Poonia said that there is no need for a coalition right now
 hamaari taraf se gathbandhan ke liye koi pahal nahin kii gai he
 He also instructed rlp's Hanuman Beniwal not to interfere in internal affairs of the BJP
 vah isse baj aaen
 Decision taken by Beniwal's fickleness? This statement of Dr
 Poonia is being linked to Beniwal's outrage
 punia ne jis tarah se beniwal ko hidaayat di, usase is charchaa ko or bal mil gaya he
 Significantly, after the Lok Sabha elections, BJP and RLP contested the assembly by-election also
 beniwal kai dfa purv mukhyamantrivasundhara raajeco lekar hamalavar ruukh apana chuke hai
 BJP leaders had been accused of frescoing recently by-election for Khivansar seat, from where Hanuman Beniwal's brother Narayan Beniwal was the candidate
 narayan ne chunaav bhi jeeta, lekin jeet kaa antar kam rahaa
 Beniwal had accused the BJP leaders of stalking on this
 isse bhi bhaajapa ke netaaon main rosh tha
 Beniwal is an MP from Nagaur, BJP had given RLP one of the 25 seats in the state
 aralapi sehanuman beniwalane nagaur sansadeey seat se congress kii jyoti mirdha ko haraakar chunaav jeeta tha
 This alliance continued in the by-elections for two assembly seats in the same month and BJP had left Khivansar seat for RLP

 Athawale had attacked Mayawati, marking the attack, Kiramdas attacked Athawalemayawati and said that if she is a true Ambedkarite, why are she still Hindu, why not adopt Buddhism?

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has once again targeted Congress President Sonia Gandhi and his rival Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra
 uddhav ne kaha ki jab assam main danga hota he to sonia gandhi vahaan jaakar daura karti hai or logon se mulaakaat karti hai, lekin kishtwar jaakar vah aisa kyon nahin karatin
 The Shiv Sena chief also commented on Sharad Pawar
 unhone kaha ki agar ensipi pramukh hindutv ke samarthak hote to bal thakare unhen jarur samarthan dete
 Uddhav said, 'we want a Prime Minister who is a supporter of Hindutva
 ' Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Rajnath Singh sought Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's resignation over the coal scam
 gauratlab he ki supreme court main koyala ghotaale kii sibiai report pesh hone se pehle piem or kanoon mantralay ke kehane par usamen badlaav kiye gaye the
 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar, while giving details of Rajnath's inaugural address at the party's national executive meeting, said, "when the Prime Minister himself is under suspicion, the cbi's status report in the coal scam, along with the then law minister Ashwani Kumar's room Why was teased? 'he said,' After seeing the changes, the Supreme Court remarked that the essence of the report changed has given
 agar is tippanee ke baad bhi pradhanmantri apane pad par bane rahete hai to yah naitikta ko darkinar kar dena hoga
 We demand that he (manmohan Singh) should resign immediately
 ’ashvini kumaar ko is khulaase ke baad kanoon mantri ke pad se istipha dena padaa tha ki koyala block aavanton main sibiai kii sthiti report ko supreme court main pesh kiye jane se pehle unhone usamen badlaav kiya tha
 The BJP president had earlier demanded that because the coal ministry was with the Prime Minister at the time of the allocation of the controversial coal block, they should introspect as to whose accountability is created in this regard
 upie ke nau saal ke shashan ke samarohon par tippanee karte hue jaavdekar ne kaha, ‘jab upie shashan ke nau saal baad desh main raajnneetik or aarthik sankat he to in samarohon kii kya aavashyaktaa he
 On Congress's allegation that the BJP interrupted the last Parliament session, Javadekar said the government was responsible for the entire situation as it did not accept the opposition's demand for the resignations of Union ministers Pawan Kumar Bansal and Ashwini Kumar
 unhone kaha, ‘ham sirf kanoon mantri or rail mantri ke istife kii maang kar rahe the
 They did not agree to our demand then, but later both had to resign
 yah pehle bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore it is the government, which is responsible for this (not running the Parliament session)

 Those who know that the sick person has to be treated in such a way that people gather outside their house and protest
 ' renuka choudhary ne kaha, 'piem istipha nahin denge
 BJP should stop dreaming of Mungerilal ' The promise of farm loan waiver was one of the important reasons for the Congress to win the assembly elections
 lekin kya rahul gandhi apane is vaade se peeche hat rahe hai ki nai congress sarkarein banane ke 10 din ke andar kisaanon ke karj maafee ke vaade ko puraa kar diya jayega? is tarah kaa daawa soshal media par hajaaron logon kii ore se kiya ja rahaa he
 Actually, the video was created by adding two clips to give a misleading message
 do jane pahachaane dakshinpanthi fasebuk pejon- ‘modinama’ or ‘nesan vid namo’ kii ore se aplod kiye gaye video main daawa kiya gaya ki rahul karj maafee ke apane vaade se peeche hat chuke hai
 The videos shared by these pages were created by combining two separate video clips
 pehla clip chhattisgarh main rahul kii ek jansabha kaa he
 The second clip is of Rahul's press conference in Delhi after the assembly election results came out on Tuesday
 modinama ke share kiye gaye video main saath main diya gaya sandesh he- ‘vaade se palate rahul’
 In the 43-second video, Rahul's videos of 'pahle' and 'baad' were simultaneously claimed - "the true color of Pappu showed within 24 hours of victory
" ”nation with namopeja par isi videyo kaa istemaal karte hue sheershak diya gaya- nattejey aane ke 24 ghanton ke bheetar hi karj maafee ke vaade se peeche hate
 The video in the first window of the Modinama page is titled with 'before winning the election
 ’ is video main rahul ke chunavi bhaashan kaa ek hissaa liya gaya he
 In this, Rahul can be heard promising that if the Congress comes to power, the loans of farmers will be forgiven within 10 days
 modinama pej ke duusare windo main video kaa sheershak diya gaya he- ‘chunaav jeetne ke baad
 In this video, a small part of Rahul Gandhi's press conference is taken, in which he can be heard saying that 'debt waiver is not the solution
 ’is report ko likhe jane tak is post ko fasebuk par 22,000 baar share kiya ja chukaa he
 Modinama has 19 lakh followers
 india today fact check team ne apni padtaal main paaya ki ‘modinama’ kii post bhraamak he
 During the election campaign, Rahul promised to waive farmers' loans in 10 days when the Congress came to power
 nattejey aane ke baad press conference main bhi rahul ne apane vaade ko doharaaya
 But at the same time, he said that 'debt waiver' is not a solution to the problems of the farmers but is 'just a step to support'
 viral video kaa pehla hissaa rahul gandhi kii chhattisgarh main die gaye chunavi bhaashana kaa hissaa he
 In this, he slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of 'failing to forgive farmers' debts'
 phir vaada kiya ki agar congress satta main ai to kisaanon ke karj 10 din main maaf kar die jaaenge
 The second part of the video was taken from Rahul Gandhi's press conference which can be seen here
 14 minute kii press conference me rahul gandhi ne karj maafee ke apane vaade ko doharaaya or kaha ki sarkaar banane ke saath hi is prakriya ko shuru kar diya jayega
 However, while answering a question in the press conference, Rahul made it clear, 'I have also said in my election speeches that debt waiver is a step to support
 karj maafee samaadhaan nahin he
 The solution to the sufferings of farmers will be a very complex process
 samaadhaan infrastracchar khada karne se or kisaanon tak takanic laane se nikalegaa
 This part of Rahul's answer was that debt waiver is not the solution
 or phir use chun kar bhraamak video banane main istemaal kiya gaya
 An investigation by the India Today Fact Check team proved that Rahul Gandhi has not backed down on his promise of debt waiver and the viral video is misleading

 BJP President Amit Shah, a close aide of PM Narendra Modi, also wanted him to become the CM of UP, but after getting a red flag from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at the last moment, his name was cut and crowned on Yogi's head

 Joint Secretary Krishna Gopal, who coordinated between RSS and BJP, was against Manoj Sinha's name for the post of CM
 90 ke daur main krishna gopal jab purvanchal main aresas ke prachaarak the, us vakt bhi manoj sinha saansad the
 On an ideological level, there was a tug of war between the two
 bhoomihaar jati se taalluk rakhane vaale manoj sinha par aarope tha ki vah ek khaas jati ke logon ke liye kaam karte hai
 The RSS wanted that such a person should become a CM who works above the caste system in the state
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki antim samay tak bijepi adhyaksh amit shah manoj sinha ke paksh main hi the
 He was also indicated
 yahi vajah he ki vah shapath grahan ke do din pehle hi apane grihnagar aa gaye the
 At that time it was also said that after visiting Kaal Bhairav and Baba Vishwanath in Varanasi, he would take the blessings of the deity in his native city and take oath of the post of CM on 19 March, but on 18 March the whole story changed

 The most shocking revelation ever revealed on Jailed Ram Rahim
 ek aisi sajeesh benakaab hui he, jo 16 saal pehle deraa ke bheetar rachi gai thi, lekin paravaan nahin chadh pai
 By making a talented student of that era his disciple, Ram Rahim wanted to get the goods of destruction which would be death at his behest
 ram rahim ke dere se hathiyaaron kaa jakhira jab jabt hua, to har koi hairaan tha ki khud ko sant bataane vaale ram rahim ke ashram main itani banduukon kii jarurat kyon aan padi
 But hearing your truth beyond this will only blow your senses
 kyonki sirf bandooken nahin ram rahim kii taiyaari to isse kahin aage bam or mixilon kaa jakhira jutaney kii thi
 No matter how strange it may sound, but one of the hundreds of secrets of Ram Rahim is that the man who describes himself as the Messenger of God was plotting such a catastrophe that if he succeeds, what would have happened
 ram rahim kii vinashlila vaali is planning kaa khulaasa kaithal ke rahane vaale virendra singh ne kiya he
 When Virender was a school student 16 years ago, he was in the limelight due to his talent
 unhone skool ke dinon missile or nae tarah ke tanks ke model taiyaar kiye the
 The then President APJ Abdul Kalam, his model placed in the Science Exhibition, was also seen and his mind was glowing
 missile modells kii jamkar charchaa hui
 This was the same period when Ram Rahim's star started climbing high
 satta ke aashirwad or kismat kii meharbaani kii badaulat ram rahim teji ke samarthakon kii taadaad lakhon se karodon kii ore teji se bad rahi thi
 In such a situation, a devilish conspiracy started taking birth in Ram Rahim's mind after hearing about Virendra's research
 usne apane logon ko virendra ke peeche laga diya
 Seeing Ram Rahim's aura in those days, Virendra too accepted his invitation
 ashram ke skool main daakhila lekar apni research par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Ram Rahim gave special status to Virendra in his ashram
 virendra ko ashram main kahin bhi berokatoke aane jane kii aazaadee mili thi
 Ram Rahim often talked to him about research
 ab sawaal uthta he ki deraa main skool ke naam par lakhon kii fees vasuulne vaale ram rahim ne virendra ko muft shiksha kaa laalach kyon diya
 Was Baba wrong to take advantage of Virendra's talent? Did he want to build a missile for himself with Virendra's help? Was Ram Rahim preparing for a future war with the government and the administration? 16 years ago, Virendra, who was camped at the invitation of Ram Rahim, believed that the truth was really dangerous, which he could not understand at that time
 wo to ganimat thi ki dere main pasre paakhand or jhooth ke samrajya ne research karne aae virendra kii ankhen jald khol di
 Virender had said goodbye to the camp in almost a year
 ram rahim kaa sapana sapana hi rah gaya

 Rahul Gandhi said, 'why don't you speak on Rafael Deal? Till date it has been said that the Defense Minister will not tell how much Rafale has been bought
 desh ko nahin bataaenge, modi ji ne ghapala kiya he, mujhe pataa he aap log darate hai
 Rahul alleged that Modi ji went to Paris and changed the Rafale agreement
 desh ko nahin bataaya ja rahaa ki rafel vimaan kitne main kharida gaya, iskaa matlab he ki ghotaalaa hua he
 Why 36 Rafale aircraft instead of 126? While senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad questioned what is the reason, this government decided to buy 36 Rafale aircraft instead of 126
 cabinet cameti of sicurity kii anumati ke bagaiyr ye sauda kiya gaya

 ' Irfan Habib, who attended the meeting of Islamic scholars with Rahul Gandhi, said that he should take up the basic issues of minority society
 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main guuruuvaar ko irfan habib ne kaha ki baithak main congress adhyaksh ko musalamaanon ke buniyadi mudde ko uthaane kii salaah di gai
 He said that Muslims are citizens of this country like the Sikh and Christian communities
 musalamaanon ko bhi unheen samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he jinase harek naagarik ko do-chaar hona padataa he
 The issue of poverty, unemployment and security is the most important before Muslims
 bataa den ki rahul ne buudhvaar ko muslim buddhijiviyon ke saath baithak kii thi
 Advice to Rahul Gandhi: Irfan Habib said to Rahul Gandhi, Muslims too feel themselves as insecure as Dalits
 uski vajah kya he, yah kuch log jaanate hai jabaki ise kuch or logon ko jaanane kii koshish kerani chahie
 Irfan Habib said, 'if you (rahul) want to talk about Muslims, then talk about those who have been sidelined
 aap unhen musalmaan kah kar bhi unki baat kar sakate hai yaa yah bhi kah sakate hai jo garib or pichde hai or khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karte hai
 Then people will feel that you are talking about the country and not just the minorities
 'itihaaskaar ne kaha, jo log congress yaa duusari partiyon paralpsankhyakon ke tushtikarnaka aarope laga rahe hai, darasal vahi log bahusnkhyakon kaa tushtikaran kar rahe hai
 He said, "is appeasement of majority majority nationalism?" Irfan Habib advised Rahul Gandhi that this is the kind of cassette that you cannot run again and again
 aap itihaas main nahin ji sakate hai or na hi use waapas laa sakate hai, lekin usase sabak le sakate hai
 The era of Indira Gandhi cannot return
 magar us jamaane se sabak lete hue congress ne jo galtiyaan kii hai, use sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 He said that not only the Congress but other parties too, when it comes to Muslims, they go out to find those with beards and hats
 ve aise dadhi topi waalon ko lekar aati hai jinka musalamaanon se koi sambandh nahin he
 They represent the small organizations that have set up shop
 irfan habib ne kaha, ' mujhe nahin lagata ki dadhi topi waalon ko musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi mana janaa chahie
 The beard cap is a religious symbol
 jo log dadhi topi kaa istemaal karte hai vah bure hai or unki bhi aalochana honi chahie jo sadhu santon ko manchon par laakar unka istemaal karte hai
 Irfan Habib expressed displeasure over politics done in the name of religion
 unhone kaha ki musalmaan, dharm or carch ke naam par siyasat nahin honi chahie
 This leads to political polarization
 aisi sthiti main hindu,hindu ban jaataa he
 a Muslim becomes a Muslim and there is no Indian
 unhone kaha, 'kal kii baithak main maine zikr kiya ki chaahe vah personal lau ho, aligarh uniwarsity ho yaa urdu kaa masalaa ho, yah aam musalamaanon ke mudde nahin hai
 The issue of common Muslims is the same as that of ordinary Hindus, in which livelihood and security is first
 ' irfan habib ne kaha, 'hamane salaah di ki vah buniyadi masalon par baat karen jisamen shiksha rojgaar jaise masale shaamil hai
 Rahul Gandhi agreed on these issues and he said that he thinks the same
 'rahul kar rahe hai party main sudharbakaul irfan habib, 'rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ham sudhaar kar rahe hai or koshish karenge ki in muddon ko uthaaen
 "he told," After listening to everyone, Rahul Gandhi said that we will improve and we know where we have made mistakes
 un galatiyon ko ham thik karne kii koshish kar rahe hai sab ko saath le chalane kii baat kar rahe hai
 'overall, it seemed that perhaps it is a matter of self-concern and the Congress cannot fight alone on its own
 use mil-julkar ladaai ladani padegi or aisa aatmachintan dikhaai pad rahaa he
 This is also true because apart from the states where the Congress can fight alone on its own, it will have to carry regional parties along with them
 hindutv kii andekhi na karenswami chakrapani ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko salaah di he ki vah maansarovar kii yatra par jaaen
 On meeting with Muslim intellectuals, he said that Congress has neglected Hindus somewhere
 congress ne hi bhagava aatankwaad kaa naam diya or usne hi sethu samudram ke ke khilaaf court main halafanama diya tha
 Today Modi has become the Prime Minister and Yogi Chief Minister, but the strength is not in him but in the Hindutva
 is baat ko samajhnaa hoga ki aap sabko saath lekar chaliye lekin hindutv ko andekha mat kiijie

 At the Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur, again on Tuesday, the same slogans were found written on the stones, which were written on the stones near the hanging corpse of Chetan Saini
 dobaaraa pattharon par vahi naare likhe milane se ilaake main hadakamp much gaya
 Soon this news started spreading on social media, due to which the police had to give clarification
 soshal media par fail rahi khabar ke chalate sampradayik maahaul kharib hone kii ashanka ke bich police ne safai di ki chetan kii maut kii gutthi sulajhane ke liye phir se puraa seen doharaaya gaya
 All those slogans were rewritten during scene recreation, some of which the police forgot to erase

 At the same time, 35 slogans found near the body of Chetan Saini were also repeated
 lekin inamen se do naaron ko mitaanaa bhul gaye
 Then what was the news on social media started becoming viral that Chetan Saini's killer once again reached the fort and is writing slogans against the Hindus
 is par mache bavaal ke bich jaipur ke adishnal kamishnar ne kaha ki ham ravivaar ko demo kar krim seen ko ricriet kar rahe the
 At the same time, these slogans were left out
 lekin media kii nasamajhi kii vajah se sansani fail gai
 The Home Minister of Rajasthan said that the police is investigating each aspect and the truth will be revealed soon
 sabhi saamaan baraamad kar ennesail ke liye bhej diya gaya he, jisaki jaanch ho rahi he
 On the other hand, FSL director BBL Arora said that they have not yet received the request for FSL investigation

 However, later the incident was not related to Padmavati
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main hui hinsa ke maamle main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chitthee likhi he
 The chairperson of the Women's Commission wrote this letter on Thursday
 aadarneey pradhanmantri ji,pichley dinon uttar pradesh ke banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay (biechayu) main ladakiyon ne apni suraksha kaa mudda uthaaya to unako suraksha dene kii bajaae unpar lathicharge kiya gaya
 This is a very sad incident
 ladkiyaan gaanv-kasbon or chote-chote shaharon se badikathinaaiyon kaa saamnakarke apane parivaar ko apni suraksha kaa bharosa dilaakar apana bhavishya banane ke liye biechayu, diu, jeenyu jaise vishvavidhyalay main padhane ke liye aati hai
 If our daughters will not be safe in the universities, how will the daughters go out to study
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar kaa 'beti bachaao beti padhaao' abhiyaan kaise safal hoga
 The incident of molestation at BHU was not the first time, but such incidents have been happening with girls for a long time
 us shanivaar ko campus ke andar ladki ke saath chhedchhad kii gai or shikaayat karne ke baad bhi biechayu prashasan ne us samay koi karrwai nahin kii
 When the university administration did not listen to the girls' complaint, they sat on a dharna to convey their voice to the university administration
 lekin unki shikayaton kaa samaadhaan karne ke bajaay unpar laathiyaan barasaai gayi
 This incident makes the mind tremble as to how and why innocent girls were lathi-punched with such bravado
 bahut shame kii baat he ki biechayu ke visi ne is mudde ko gambhirtha se lene kii bajaay ulta ladakiyon ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya or media main gaiyr samvedansheel bayaan die
 Such statements of VC of a university breaks the morale of female students from all over the country
 baar-baar ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad sirf biechayu kii ek ghatana nahin he
 In the last one week, there has been a big mistake in the safety of girls in two colleges of Delhi
 dilli uniwarsity ke ambedkar kalege ke kareeb 500 students campus ke aas paas surakshit maahaul kii maang ko lekar police stesan pahunch gaye
 Because on the day of this college campus, there are incidents of molestation and snatching of girls
 duusari ghatana dilli univircity campus ke andar khalsa kalege main hui, jahaan kuch logon ne girls hostel main ghusane kii koshish kii
 Along with the issue of safety of girls, the discrimination that is happening with them in universities and colleges across the country is also an important issue
 dilli ke kai vishvavidhyalay va colegeladakiyon ke pratibhedbhaavpurn vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 In many universities and colleges located in Delhi, the time of girls 'hostels is different from the time of boys' hostels
 jab dilli mahila ayog ne ladakiyon ke saath ho rahe bhedbhaav kaa kaaran poocha to kai uniwarsity va collejon ne tark diya ki ladakiyon kii suraksha ke chalate unhen ladakon kii tulana main jaldi apane hostalon main lautne kaa niyam banaaya gaya he
 It is very sad that even after 70 years of independence, girls are being discriminated against in the highest institutions of education
 dilli uniwarsity ke hi hindu kalege main ladakiyon se ladakon kii tulana main adhik hostel fees lee ja rahi he
 To this end, the Delhi Commission for Women tried to end discrimination against girls from UGC to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, but nothing has happened so far
 akasar dekha gaya he ki jab ladakiyon dwaara apni suraksha ko lekar uniwarsity va college prashasan se maang kii jaati he to ladakiyon par hi bhedbhaavpurn niyamon ko thopakar unhen hostalon main jaldi aane kaa farmaan suna diya jaataa he
 Instead of providing an open and safe environment in college campuses, pizjara is being made for girls
 campus ko surakshit banane ke liye kai str par prayaas karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is extremely important to install CCTV around campus, increase police patrolling and light the streets
 sabase jaruri he ki yadi kisi ladki ke saath chhedchhad yaa duusari koi apriy ghatana hoti he touniwarsitive college prashasan ko sakht hidaayat ho ki aise maamle dabaaye nahin balki peedit ladakiyon kii madad karen
 a safe environment should be created for girls not only in Delhi's campus-colleges but also in campuses across the country
 sar ham chaahate hai ki-1
 For the lathi charge on the girls in BHU campus, the Vice Chancellor should be dismissed immediately and strict action should be taken against them and girls should be provided security
 2
 The discrimination that is happening in the girls and boys hostels across the country, not in Delhi, should be eliminated immediately
 saath hi is par rashtriya str par policy banaai jaae
 3
 dilli ke hindu college sahit desh kii anya uniwarsities or collejon main ladakiyon ke hostel fees ke bhedbhaav ko tunrat khatm kiya jaae
 a policy should be formulated at this national level
 4

 ) It is not surprising to see America withdrawing from UNESCO due to the alleged controversy over the granting of Palestinian World Heritage Site status
 jaisaa ki stenford uniwarsity ke shodhakarta pro
 "the history of UNESCO and America has been controversial," says Lynn Meskell, often surrounded by conspiracies, politics and segregation
 '' taaja vivaad main america ne israel ke is paksh kii tarafdaari kii ki hebron ko falstini sthal ke rup main darj kiya janaa iske yahudee charitra ko nasht karata he
 US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said, "unesco's over-politicization has been a cause of embarrassment for a long time
" ''hebron ko viraasat sthal chune jane kaa faisla 195 sadsy deshon ke bich se chaynit 21 sadasyon kii vishwa viraasat cameti ne kiya he jo ki duniya bhar ke rashtron ke najariye kaa aks he
 Clearly, the increasing number of member countries in the United Nations is making its institutions more transparent and democratic
 bharat kii ore se vishwa viraasat cameti main 2012 se 2015 tak rahete hue maine 2012 or 2014 main falstini abhilekhon or aise faisle kaa unesco ke sachivalay par prabhaav dekha tha, jiske chalate vishwa viraasat kosh ke kaarybal main kaaphi kami ai thi or vah sankatagrast ho gaya tha
 The US had withheld payments that carried a fifth of unesco's spending
 iske baad bharat samet duusare sadsy deshon ne bakaaye ke alaava unesco ko samay-samay par apane vishesh anudaan se madad kii
 unesco's outgoing DG Irina Bokova commented that the recent exit of the United States for World Heritage Sites would hurt her further from UNESCO
 unesco ke 55 karod dollar karj kaa dendar hone ke baavjood america uski vishwa viraasat suchi main apane sthalon ko dalava kar is sthiti kaa laabh uthaata rahaa he
 The list has 23 US destinations, the last of which was added in 2015
 iske alaava bhavishya main namakan ke liye uski sambhavit suchi 20 sthalon kii he (2017 main 10)
 Nine of Israel's sites are on this list, the last of which was added in 2015 and 18 sites are on its potential list
 falstin ke teen sthal suchi main shaamil hai, jinhen 2012, 2014 or 2017 main joda gaya jabaki 13 sambhavit suchi main hai
 Is this the anti-israel position, as stated in the US State Department letter to the director-general of UNESCO? The US has had its monuments put in place since 2011 and it has not given the outstanding amount
 use afsos hoga ki kyon nahin usne 2017 main koi namakan kiya
 As his membership tenure expires on December 31, 2018, he could easily put his site on the list without paying again, to be executed in June 2018
 sadsyta se baahar ho jane kaa sidhaa asar uske 20 sambhavit namakanon par padegaa
 This act of America is unfortunate
 yah faisla america ke un sarkari or nijee saanskrithik sansthaanon ore se samarthit nahin he jo ab bhi unesco ke saath rishta banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Stakeholders of existing World Heritage sites such as San Antonio and the Met Museum and J
 paal getti jaise pratishthit saanskrithik sansthaanon ne apni chintaaen is sambandh main saarvajanik kii hai
 As a member of the committee, in its previous tenure, India played an important role in revising several UNESCO procedures
 saath hi chandigarh jaise shaharon ko viraasat sthal kii suchi main dalwaaya tha
 It will be important for India to remain behind such goals at this time while UNESCO has given equal preference to Asia, Arab countries, Latin America and African regions after the historical domination of Europe and America
 bharat ko 2014 main shuru kiye gaye project mausam ke tahat hind mahaasaagar ke namakan ko lekar or zyada sakriyata dikhaani hogi kyonki china teji se maritime silk root kaa prachaar kar rahaa he
