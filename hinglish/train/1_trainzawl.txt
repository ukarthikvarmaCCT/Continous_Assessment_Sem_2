 logon ko isse kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Given the sensitivity of the city, the DM has given this order

 Please tell that in West Bengal, there was a fierce politics on the slogan 'jai Shri Ram'
 iske baad hanuman chalisa kii raajnneeti ne teji pakadi
 When people read Hanuman Chalisa on the streets in Howrah, a similar view was seen in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan bhi hanuman chalisa kaa paath sadakon par padhaa gaya
 Because of which there was a long jam on the road
 aligarh ke saasni get chauraahey ke kaali mandir par bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad ke kaaryakartaaon ne ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye hanuman chalisa kaa paath kiya or aarti kii

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who described himself as secular, has now adopted a new tactic to woo Muslim voters
 bihar sarkaar ab muslim bahul ilaakon main urdu main hordings lagaaegi
 JDU, which broke its 17-year relationship with BJP in the name of Narendra Modi, wants to further enhance its secular image
 sarkaar kaa tark he ki urdu main hordings lagane se muslim bahul ilaakon main log sarkaar kii yojanaon ke bare main acchhee tarah se jaan sakenge
 However, BJP alleges that the government is doing this to woo Muslim voters
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mangal pande kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar muslim voton ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai, lekin isse acha massej nahin jaataa he, janata in baton ko khub samajhati he
 Even when the BJP was with Nitish Kumar, many such schemes started which benefited the minorities
 jisamen chaatr-chaatraon ko metric paas karne par wajife kaa dene kaa faisla haalanki is yojana main 75 pratishat paisa centre sarkaar kaa hota he par bihar sarkaar ne ise achche se lagu kiya
 In the same way, the state government was promptly pursuing the issue of giving land in Kishanganj for Aligarh Muslim University, while the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad also opposed it
 muslim mahilaon ke liye hunar kaarykram kii shuruyaat bijepi ke saath rahete hue kiya gaya tha, jisamen mahilaon ko kaam sikhaane ke saath-saath 25 rupee vyavsaay ke liye diya jaataa he
 Even before governments worked to polarize Muslims, former Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra declared Urdu as the second state language, when he was named Maulana by his opponents
 bihar ke simanchal main khaskar kishanganj purniyan, arriya or katihaar jaise ilaake muslim bahul hai or vahaan bahut log aise bhi hai, jinaki padhai urdu madhyam se hoti he
 In such a situation, it will be known what the government is doing for them, their families and children
 jediu ko isamen koi buraai najar nahin aa rahi he party kaa maananaa he ki urdu bihar kii mahatvapurn bhashaa he or agar us bhashaa ke jariye sarkaar janata tak apni baat pahunchaana chaahati he to kya buraai he

 Japan can prove to be very helpful in achieving this goal, which Modi has prepared for taking the Indian economy to the level of five trillion dollars
 modi ne is mudde par japani pradhanmantri shinje abe ke saath badi gambhirtha ke saath manthan kiya he
 The chemistry of the Prime Minister of both the countries is expected to revive the domestic stock market

 On this occasion, Modi stressed that the partnership between India and Japan has taken the form of a strong special strategic and global partnership
 donon desh ab sabase vishwasaneey aarthik or aadhunik takneekee ke bhagidaar hai
 The two countries are side by side on the issue of trade war and growing concerns about regional stability
 modi ne spasht kiya ki donon deshon kii saajheedaari vishesh uddeshy praapt karne ke liye he
 This friendship rests on a shared vision and commitment towards India's 'act East Policy' and an independent, open and inclusive india-pacific
 in tamaam muddon kii vajah se modi kii yah yatra duniya bhar main charchaa kaa vishay ban gai he

 However, the market has recently dismissed all the apprehensions of so-called experts
 yadi yah sakaaratmak rukh jari rahata he to nifti ke jald hi 10,500-10,600 kii ore badhane kii sambhaavna he
 However, if the Nifty remains below the psychological level of 10,000, this fact may also be reversed

 baharhaal dilli krime branch kii team ne patna police kii madad se dow jon ko giraftaar kar use court main pesh kiya he
 Now he will be taken to Delhi
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki is racket ke kai or logon ke saath master mind ko bhi jald hi dilli krime branch kii team giraftaar karegi
 a shocking video has surfaced from Maharajganj in Uttar Pradesh in which a maulana of a madrasa is seen stopping children and teachers from singing the national anthem after the flag hoisting
 is ghatana ke saamne aane ke baad police ne teen logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The Maharajganj police have arrested Mohammad Junaid Ansari, Mohammad Azlur Rahman and Mohammad Nizam
 in teenon ne 15 agast ko ladakiyon ke madrase main tirangaa fahraae jane ke baad raashtragan kaa na sirf virodh kiya tha balki use roka bhi tha
 He was arrested late last night after the case was registered
 bataa den ki maharajaganj ke kolhui thana kshetra ke ek madrase main swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par buudhvaar subah tirangaa to fahraaya gaya, lekin dhwajarohan ke turant baad hone vaale raashtragan ko roak diya gaya
 This national anthem was stopped by no one else but a Maulana of the same madrasa
 haalanki vahaan maujuud shikshak raashtragan gane ke liye jor dete rahe, lekin is tathakthith moulana ne islam or musalmaan kii duhai dete hue na sirf jabaran raashtragan gane se roka balki bacchon ko bhi vahaan se hataane par utaaru ho gaya
 The resentment of Maulana was clearly visible among the people present there, but in the madrasa he speaks, so he managed to stop the national anthem
 jahaan ek taraf puraa deshswatantraaa diwasko shandaar tareeke se manaane main laga hua tha, vahiin maharajaganj ke ek madrase arbia ahale sunnat anawaare taiba girls college badgo main hue vaakye ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 After the flag hoisting ceremony at a madrasa in Kolhui police station area, a maulvi issued a decree to the students not to sing the national anthem, after which a teacher present on the occasion protested, and the maulvi asked for a good song from Sare Jahan
 iske baad vah islam or musalmaan hone kii baat karne laga
 This video of the non-national anthem being played became increasingly viral in the entire area
 police adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki pehle jhandarohan ke baad raashtragan nahin hone diya gaya tha, lekin jab madrase ke teacher kii ore se virodh kiya gaya or uskaa video banaaya gaya to baad main raashtragan karaayaa gaya
 It is seen in this video that Maulana is ordering children not to sing the national anthem
 viral video ke is maamle kii soochna police ko di gai he
 Maharajganj SP Ashutosh Shukla said that after the video of this incident was made, the national anthem has been held in that madrasa, but it will be investigated
 agar jaanch main paaya gaya ki raashtragan nahin hua he to kanoonee karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Yogi government had talked about singing the national anthem and video recording in all the madrasas, but this madrasa of Kolhui police station also ignored the orders of the UP government

 ' Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat has changed the time of his Kedarnath visit
 ab wo 5 may se 9 may tak kedarnath kaa daura karenge
 Speaking to the media in Haldwani, he said that he has taken this decision in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit on April 29
 harish ravat ne kaha ki ve nahin chaahate ki unki vajah sepiem or unke vidhayakonke kaarykram main koi baadha utpann ho
 Let us know that the Chief Minister of 19 bjp-ruled states including Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to visit Kedarnath
 harish ravat ne kaha ki wo kedarnath ke prati aasthaa ke saath- saath yah bhi dekhnaa chaahate hai ki pichley 1 saal main rajya sarkaar dwaara vahaan kitna nirmaan kaary hua he, jisko dekhte hue piem se lekar saare vidhayak kedarnath aane ke liye itane utsuk hai
 Earlier, Harish Rawat had targeted PM Modi and BJP fiercely, saying that Kedarnath is a religious tourist destination
 ise bijepi ke log picnic spot banane main lage hue hai
 Former Chief Minister Harish Rawat also questioned the tendering being done by the excise policy of the government of Uttarakhand and said that the Chief Minister and the Excise Minister are acting like salesmen of liquor syndicate
 purv mukhyamantri harish ravat ne aarope lagaaya ki bahari sindicket ko standing ke madhyam se pradesh kii sharaab kii dukaanon ko aavantit karne kaa sarkaar kaa yah suniyojit plan he, jiske tahat i-tendering main bade-bade rasukhadaaron ko mauka milegaa jabaki chote log isamen hissaa nahin le paaenge
 Radhika Apte is known for her tough mood
 unhone ek intervyuu ke dauraan film shooting ke samay hone vaali un baton par baat kii, jo unhen katai pasand nahin he
 Radhika was asked if she disappoints people by saying 'no' during work or shooting? In response, Radhika said, It is interesting that there is this impression among people that i do not keep saying things
 jo log mujhe kareeb se jaanate hai ki ve kahenge ki main kabhi manaa nahin kar sakati
 There are many things i do not agree on
 jaise let aana, shooting ke din badhanaa, apane contract ke khilaaf janaa
 Radhika Apte described the distance from her husband as 'tedious' and quite 'expensive'
 Radhika said, 'extra time is never paid for any money'
 shoshan sirf sexual nahin hota
 i never say anything
 mujhe pataa he ki mere aawaaj uthaane se kuch nahin hoga, main apana hi kariyar kharaab kar luungi
 But if Akshay Kumar sounds, then something can happen
 unhone bollywood main apni ek jagah bana lee he
 My experience working with him at Padman was quite interesting
 ve aath ghante kaam karte the
 When Radhika Apte slaps Tamil star, know why did Aisaradhika say, "I try to go to London every month to be with my husband
" ve bhi mujhase milane ke liye aate rahete hai
 This experience is quite tiring for both of us and proves to be costly
 mujhe yaad he ki kabhi-kabhi log plane main milte hai or poochhate hai ki itnaa paisa kyon uda rahi ho? meri pratikriya hoti he ki ye kya baat hui
 i made three trips in two months
 ek to bilkul last minute par
 i suddenly got the week off
 ye kaaphi mahangi lifestil he
 Two houses in two expensive cities and two-three tickets a month
 isliye main phijul kharch nahin karti
 "let me tell you that Radhika will soon be seen in Netflix's first original Indian series" Sacred Games "
 isamen saf ali khan or navazuddin siddiki bhi honge
 Earlier Radhika was seen in r Balki's Padman with Akshay Kumar

 Although its date has not been announced yet, possibly this rally will be organized on 24 February or 3 March
 is raily ke bare main janata dal united (jediu) ne saidhantik rup se apni sahmati de di he or BJP ke netaaon ke saath kis tithi ko iskaa aayojan kiya jaye is par vichaar vimarsh chal rahaa he
 This will be the first time when Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar and National President of JDU, from the political platform will praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his work to make Prime Minister once again, besides appealing to people to vote
 nitish kumaar ne 2017 ke july maheene main jab se BJP ke saath ek baar phir se sarkaar banaai he tab se kai baar samvaadadaata sammelan main or kuch sarkari kaaryakramon main unhone is baat kaa daawa saarvajanik rup se kiya he ki agali baar phir janata janadesh pradhanmantri narendra modi ke paksh main degi

 But when Nitish left the BJP in June 2013, for the first time in October, Narendra Modi started his Lok Sabha election campaign from Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 usee raily ke dauraan bam blast main kai logon kii jaane gayi or bhartiya janata party ko puure desh main iskaa bharpoor laabh mila
 JDU said- Our stand on the Ram temple issue has not changed, BJP said- No differences on development: Ravi Vilas Paswan, the national president of Lok Janshakti Party, the third constituent of the coalition in Bihar, and his son Chirag Paswan will also be present
 jahaan tak tithi kaa sawaal he to bhartiya janata party ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki filhal 2 sambhavit tithiyon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Either this rally will be held on 24 February or a grand event will be held on 3 March
 mana ja rahaa he ki march ke pehle hafte main loksabhaa chunaav kii tithiyon kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi

 The $ 85 billion cut in expenditure will begin from March 1
 nijee or sarkari kshetra ke arthshaastri maanate hai ki isse aarthik vruddhi dar main 60 pratishat ank tak kii kami aa sakati he

 This will weaken the global economy

 yah manoram sthaan rajput gaurav kaa itihaas-sthal he jo aaj ateet kii lok kathaon or kisson main simat kar rah gaya he
 This is the same Khetri towards which a man named Narendranath Dutt (he was known as Swami Bibidishanand at that time) turned to financial aid repeatedly and wrote long letters to the immediate ruler Ajit Singh Bahadur with his thoughts
 He used to get it done
 ajit singh swami ke shishy the or unhone hi vivekanand naam sujhaayaa tha
 Swami Vivekananda was the first to return to Khetri after giving his famous lecture at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in September 1893
 khetadi hi vah jagah he jahaan bachapan main motilal nehru ko lekar unke bade bhai nandlaal aae the
 Nandlal was a teacher there before Raja Fateh Singh became the Diwan
 isi khetadi main nandlaal ne 1870 main fateh singh kii maut kii khabar ko chipa liya tha or paas sthit alsisar se ajit singh ko nau saal kii umr main god lekar unka uttaradhikari banwaaya tha
 Nandlal later moved to Agra and eventually settled in Allahabad to pursue advocacy, whose legacy was carried forward by his younger brother Motilal and then later by Motilal's son Jawaharlal

 There is a war on the ownership of property worth more than Rs

 yah sari sampatti 1987 main khetadi ke aakhri shaasha raay bahadur sardaar singh kii maut ke baad se rajya ke sangrakshan main he
 Sardar Singh was divorced with no children, due to which the state government was created after his death in 1956 but the rarely used law was to implement the Rajasthan Escorts Regulation Act and take over the entire property in the absence of a successor
 tab se kanoonee jang chali aa rahi he
 The battle is between three parties — a Khetri Trust which was created according to the will of Sardar Singh and according to the Trust's website all the property for education and research work was passed on to him
 doosraa paksh kanoonee uttaradhikari na hone kii sthiti main sardaar singh ke parijanon kaa he or teesraa paksh rajya kaa he
 Fighting in Court Those claiming their proximity to this princely state, however, have not found much success in the courts
 dilli hycourt ne 2012 main khetadi trust ko bada jhatka dete hue 1987 kii uski yachika ke khilaaf faisla sunaaya, jisamen sari shahi sampatti ko sarkaar kii ore se use die jane kii baat kahi gai thi
 During the course of 30 years, the petition was heard by 25 judges and finally giving a verdict on the legal validity of Sardar Singh's 1985 will, the court said that he doubted the genuineness of the will
 is faisle ke khilaaf trust kii apil ko ek khandpeeth ne manjuur kar liya tha lekin us par faisla aane main abhi kai or saal lag jaaenge
 In November 2012, the Rajasthan High Court dismissed the petition of Gaj Singh of Alcisar, who claimed to be the heir apparent, being the adopted son of Sardar Singh
 unhone to yahaan tak daawa kiya tha ki sardaar singh kii maut ke baad april, 1987 main unhone hi paaramparik ‘paag dastur’ (uttaradhikariyon manonith karne kii parampara) kii rasm nibhaai thi
 However, a two-judge bench of the High Court amended it the following year, following which, in July 2014, Jaipur Collector Krishna Kunal issued notice to Khetri for filing legal heirs' claims on the property
 mukademon kii is fehrist se ramakrishna ashram bhi achoota nahin rah sakaa, jise 1958 main sardaar singh ne apane dada ajit singh bahadur or swami vivekanand kii smriti main ek bhavy bhawan or kai anya suvidhaayen daan main di thim taaki rajasthan main ashram kaa pehla centre vahaan kholaa ja sake
 Last June, Khetri Trust filed an FIR against Ramakrishna Mission Secretary Swami Atmanathanananda, accusing him of evacuating the trust's office
 baad main trust ko uskaa daftar saare saamaan ke saath waapas lautaa diya gaya
 Who is the owner? Khetri House has been sold many times through fake affidavits
 ek baar to maharashtra ke ek kaarobaari netaa ne saarvajanik vigyaapan dekar use bech daalaa tha jiskaa daawa he ki vah vivaadit sampatti ke kaarobaar main he
 Ironically, this property is officially under government protection
 philhal maujuuda trustiyon main jodhpur ke tatkaaleen maharaja gaj singh, atirikt police mahanideshak ajit singh shekhavat or prithviraj singh apekshaakrit zyada prabhaavshaalee log hai lekin yah vivaad jitna bada he, us lihaaj se ye log bhi khud ko asahaay mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Also, they have no official title to these properties, so according to Gaj Singh, they have lodged 10 firs against fake buyers, sellers and encroachers and they believe that only the trust can take care of them They can be used in the spread of education
 pehle vishwa yuddh main khetadi se 14,000 sainikon ko ladgaye ke liye bheja gaya tha, jinamein 2,000 ne apni jaan de di thi
 Today, Khetri is fighting the battle to save his crumbling royal heritage in the grip of negligence, confusion, fraud and endless litigation

 Pranab Mukherjee, the then Finance Minister, presented the General Budget again on 16 March
 vipakshi dalon nepranab mukherjeeke us kadam kaa hawala dete hue chunaav ayog se kaha ki sarkaar kii manshaa bajet pehle pesh karke voter ko prabhavit karne kii he
 With reference to the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections of 2008, these parties also cited the assembly elections of Jammu and Kashmir held in 2008
 tab upie sarkaar koi skim laana chaahati thi, lekin endie ne chunaavon ko prabhavit karne kii daleel dete hue faisle ko vapaas lene kii maang kii thi or tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne apane kadam waapas bhi khinch liye the

 If this is not done then fair elections are not possible

 People take leave and go home, play Holi, but policemen are worried that there may be no riots
 police vibhaag ke 35 hajaar javaanon ne apni shahadat di, jiske baad is desh ke log aaj khud ko surakshit mahasoos karte hai
 "amit Shah said," We are considering creating a modus operandi bureau
 narkotics beuro ke dhaanche main ham badlaav chaahate hai

 holi main huddang na ho or gulaalo kii bauchhaar na ho to bhala kisi holi! bazaar main rangon tathaa pichakaari kii kharid joro par he lekin doctoron kaa kahana he ki rangon ke is parv main maamuli si asaavadhaanee sehat par baari pad sakati he
 Dr
 Sangeeta Mutreja, an ophthalmologist, says, "in Holi, there is a possibility of the eye being affected by color
 chehre par lagaate samay rang udata bhi he or yah ankhon main pahunchataa he
 Many chemicals are added to the color that can be dangerous
 isse ankhon main jalan or allergy ho sakati he
 "he said" so care should be taken while applying color that the color should not go into the eyes
 baahar jate samay ankhon par rangeen chashma avashya pahananaa chahie taaki sookhaa udata rang, dhul yaa rangeen pani ankhon par sidhe na pade
 "both dry and wet colors are harmful for asthma patients," says Dr
 AK Vats
 sookhe rang shwaas nalika ke jariye fefdon main pahunchate hai or vahaan ke vayukoshon main ekatra hote hai jisase shwaas lene main takalif hoti he
 Wet colors further exacerbate asthma
 rangon se allergy bhi asthma kaa ek kaaran hoti he
 Prussian blue is added to blue gulal which can cause skin allergies and infections
 ’’ vah kehete hai ‘‘holi ke rang twachaa ke liye or baalo ke liye bhi nuksaandaayak ho sakate hai
 Some manufacturers use diesel, chromium iodine, engine oil, copper sulphate and lead powder etc
 to make low cost gulal
 isse logon ko chakkar aata he, sirdard or saans kii takalif hone lagati he
 "it would be surprising to hear that some chemicals added to Gulal can also cause cancer," says Dr
 Vats
 chamkile gulaal main aluminium bromide milaayaa jaataa he jo cancer utpann kar saktaa he
 Mercury sulfite added to red gulal can cause skin cancer
 ye rang baalo ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 It is better to apply coconut oil on the skin and hair before applying the color so that the color does not go deeper
 ’’ mou ke anusaar, aksar sookhe gulaal main esbestus yaa silica milaai jaati he jisase asthma, twachaa main sacrunman or ankhon main jalan kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 Wet colors are usually added to the Gentian Violet, which can affect skin color and cause dermatitis
 dow sangeeta kahati hai ki jaankaree yaa jaagrukta ke abhaav main aksar dukandaar, khaas kar chote dukandaar is bare main dhyaan nahin dete ki rangon kii gunvattta kisi he
 Sometimes these colors come in boxes that are written "for industrial use only
" ’’ jaahir he ki khatra isamen bhi he
 According to Mou, the colors of Holi come under Small Scale Industries and there is no 'prescribed Ragulation and Quality Check' for Small Scale Industries

 ) november kii 19 taarikh ko bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne jab parihaas ke lahaze main kaha ki ek din ve desh ke pradhanmantri bhi ban sakate hai, to is bayaan par har koi hatprabh rah gaya
 Addressing a gathering at Patna's Sri Krishna Memorial Hall, Manjhi said, "I have become the Chief Minister by stumbling, i should not become Prime Minister now
" "is maamle ko haas-parihaas ke aage dekhen to lagata he ki maanjhi ke nae sapanom kaa izhaar darasal lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar kii ekajutata ke antarvirodhon ko hi ujagar kar rahaa he
 That too at a time when it is difficult for RJD and JD (U) to save themselves in front of BJP in Bihar
 narendra modi kii bhagava lahar ke bainks khadi rajya kii samaajawaadee raajnneeti main gajab kii uthal-puthal he
 Old enemies have been forgotten and new friendships are being restored
 maanjhi kaa ubhaar nitish ke uttaradhikari ke rup main hua tha
 But even today, his continuation in the post of Chief Minister proves that Nitish and Lalu, the two leaders of socialist politics, have joined hands but there is a distance between them
 argedy or jedy(you) netaaon ke ek tabake kaa maananaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baavjood nitish kumaar, jo bihar ke kayakalp ke sutaradhar hai, hi bihar sarkaar ke netritv ke liye vishwasaneey ho sakate hai
 Says a senior JD (U) leader, "as long as the JD (U) stayed with the BJP, Nitish Kumar kept Narendra Modi from campaigning in Bihar
" agar party ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman jithan ram maanjhi kii bajaae nitish ke haath main hi rahani he to behatar he ki ve waapas aakar sarkaar kaa netritv karen
 This will give strength to the party and the alliance
 "saamaanya paristhitiyon kaa takaza yah tha ki argedy ke jedy(you) sarkaar ko samarthan dene ke baad nitish ko jedy(you) kii santhnik takat ke bare main chintaa chhod deni chahie thi or mukhyamantri ke pad par waapas aa janaa chahie tha
 Only then could he do his best in terms of good governance, but he opted to take contact trips across the state so that the party organization could be killed
 yah ek aisa kaam he jisamen unka pichhlaa record bahut utsahjanak nahin rahaa he
 Says a JD (U) leader, "nitish Kumar has never been an organizer
" ve sanghathan ke sadsy hone ke mukaable kahin zyada ek prashaasak kii bhoomika main rahe hai
 While in the post of Chief Minister, he had taken a tough decision in the past like scrapping the discretionary grants of mlas, which also hurt the party cadre
 "jis shaks ko jananetaa or kushal prashaasak mana jaataa ho, vah agar chunaavon se saal bhar pehle se hi jedy(you) ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath apane sambandh majboot karne main juta he to nitish kii yah kavayad do kadavi vaastaviktaaon ko ujagar karti he
 First, they know that they have to activate their cadres long before the elections and second, they do not intend to rely too much on Lalu and his team for the 2015 assembly elections
 argedy ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, yahi vidambnaa he or maanjhi kii ahmiyat bhi yaheen banati he
 On the condition of anonymity, he said, "though Lalu and Nitish are serious about fighting against BJP together, there is a lack of trust between the two
" iske chalate maanjhi kaa kaarykaal chalata ja rahaa he
 It will take them time to prepare themselves to support each other for the top post in Bihar
 iskaa sidhaa-sa arth he ki tab tak maanjhi jaisaa evji ummidavaar is pad par utane lambey samay tak bana rahe jitna khud usne na sochaa ho
 "(lalu Yadav with Nitish Kumar at a meeting) On November 18, the dissenting opinion of Lalu and Nitish on the merger of RJD-JD (U) also indicates that there is a lack of dialogue between the two
 nitish ne donon dalon ke vilay kii kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar kiya tha jabaki lalu ne kaha tha ki is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 During his Sampark Yatra, Nitish had admitted that efforts are being made for solidarity among the Janata Parivar parties to take on the BJP
 vahiin lalu ne jharkhand pravaas ke dauraan kaha, ''sab charchaa main he, isko (vilay ko) rule out nahin karte
 "it is believed that apart from JD (U) and RJD, four other teams can form a front or merge with each other next month to form a new party
 mulaayam singh kii samaajawaadee party, omprakash chautaala kaa indian neshnal lok dal, purv pradhanmantri ech
 D
 devegoda kaa janata dal (secular) or takreeban lupt ho chuki samaajawaadee janata party bijepi virdohi takat ko shashakt karne ke liye ek chat ke neeche aa sakati hai
 In the meeting of these six parties in Delhi, Nitish may agree to form a new party which includes everyone
 ve akele jedy(you) or argedy ke vilay par sahamat nahin honge
 After the political solidarity of Lalu and Nitish, the much talked about merger exercise will be a logical culmination
 isse donon dalon ke bich seat bantwaare kii gambhir samasya bhi chant jaaegi kyonki yadi ise hal nahin kiya gaya to dobaaraa donon dalon ke matbhed ubhar aaenge
 The Bihar Legislative Assembly has 243 seats and the JD (U) has 118 mlas
 aise main vah isse kam siton par ladgaye ko taiyaar nahin hoga
 Lalu Dhara, however, does not recognize this JD (U) strength and reminds him that in 2010, Nitish won 115 seats by aligning with BJP
 beete loksabhaa chunaavon main argedy-congress-ensipi gathbandhan ne jedy(you) ke 17 ke mukaable 54 assembly siton par badhat banaai thi jabaki endie 171 siton par aage rahaa tha
 The RJD urges that this figure be considered as a measure of their personal electoral strength and this should also form the basis of seat sharing
 jaahir he jedy(you) is par sahamat nahin hoga
 The RJD-JD (U) and the Congress alliance had won the RJD candidate on three out of the four when the alliance was defeated by the BJP 6-4 in the state in August by-election
 jedy (you) ko do or congress ko ek seat mili thi
 Encouraged by this victory, RJD leaders do not forget to show their electoral strength against JD (U) by showing their ability to win seats
 aise paridrishy main donon dalon ke bich vilay kaa vikalp hi taakak jaan padataa he
 This will solve the controversial issue of seat sharing
 jedy(you) ko ek dar yah bhi he ki navnirmit ikai par kahin lalu kaa varchasv na ho jaae or kahin baaki takatein darkinar na kar di jaaen
 Riding on the wave of Mandal movement with Lalu, Nitish's political star was shining, but in the manner and behavior of his work, he is completely different from the RJD chief
 paramparaagat mandal raajnneeti se chipke rahe lalu se itar nitish ne khud kii chhavi sushasan vaale netaa kii banaai he jo vikaas, aarthik vruddhi or saamaajik sudhaaron kii baat karata he jinase mandal daur ke unke sahyogi lagaataar bachate rahe hai
 If anything brings up Nitish's counterpart to Narendra Modi, it is that he keeps his family away from his politics
 bhai-bhatijawad ke khilaaf unki vishwasaneeyata ne unhen anya kshetreey kshatrapon jaise mulaayam yaa lalu ke bainks majboot banaae rakhaa he
 In the past, he has refused to give tickets to relatives of his party mps
 ho saktaa he, niteesha ne mahaj chunavi uddeshyon ke liye lalu ko gale lagaaya ho taaki janata parivaar kii kavayad ke naam par apane-apane janaadhar ko modi lahar se paidaa hue khatre se bachaaya ja sake
 It is equally true that Nitish cannot be comfortable with the Lalu brand of politics
 jaahir he is dauraan maanjhi ke paas sapane dekhne ke liye kuch or vakt he

 Actress Juhi Chawla's film Chalk n Duster, which has spent more than 2 decades in the film industry, has recently been released
 ek choti si mulaakaat ke jariye jaane is film or juhi se jude kuch khaas baton ke bare main -'chock en duster' main aapako teacher kaa role kyon pasand aayaa?mujhe film kii script acchhee lagi thi
 For this role i had to see the teachers who walk
 chote bajet main jindagi gujaarte hai
 They know the price of rice and lentils
 main asal jindagi main aisi bilkul bhi nahin hum
 i wanted to play a real character
 isiilie maine yah kirdaar nibhaayaa
 Did you meet the teachers for the film? If not, but when your children used to leave school, they would see their teachers
 or unke activity ke hisaab se hi maine yah role kiya
 The film's writer's wife is also a teacher
 mainen sochaa tha ki unase jaakar miluun, par nahin mil pai
 Once upon a time, you used to do films with 'girl Next Door', why not make such films now? Raju Hirani makes films like that today
 vah hasaate or rulaate hue aapako film dikhaate hai
 But in 'chalk n Duster' i played a real life character
 aapane 2 dashak se bhi zyada kaa vakt industry main bitaayaa he, yahaan par koun aapkaa teacher rahaa he?maine kai logon se siikhaa he
 i did not know that i would become an actress
 main thodi 'mumtaj' ji jaisi bananaa chaahati thi, phir padmini kolhapure kii film 'prem rog' se prerit hui
 Then when i joined the industry, Toshridevi was a big star
 unhen dekhnaa kaaphi pasand tha
 i was convinced of her dance, romance and comedy
 phir jab maine acting shuru kii to shridevi ko copy karne kii koshish karti thi
 But could not even get close to them
 phir maine khud ko dekhnaa shuru kiya
 i have learned good Hindi from Director Aziz Mirza
 mahesh bhatta ji ne bhi kai baaten sikhain
 i learned to work in romantic films from Yash Chopra
 dream world jaisaa hota tha
 Later i learned a lot from real life movies while working with Nagesh Kukunoor
 is film main shabana azmi aapaki ko-star hai, kaisaa anubhav rahaa?shabana ji ko script pasand ai
 She played a Maharashtrian woman in the film
 unhone film main apane ghar ke pardon ke bare main poocha to mekar ne kaha kii wo regular parde honge
 Then Shabana Ji said that no, the curtains of the house should be made of old sarees
 kyonki kam kharche se ghar chalaane vaale logon ke yahaan parde unke puraane kapadon se taiyaar kiye jate hai
 i was happy to hear this thing of Shabana ji
 aap har din kuch naa kuch nayaa sikhte hai
 Were you comfortable with the presence of Shabana Azmi? i was very happy that Kishabanaji is in the film
 film main kaam karte hue unke bare main bahut kuch jaani
 Are you enjoying this phase of your career? Yes, this is very new to me
 mujhe majaa aa rahaa he
 The film also has depth of life with the drama
 aapane is film ke liye scooter chalaanaa siikhaa, aapane 'yas bos' main bhi scooter chalaaya tha?'yas bos' main to un logon ne mujhase chalava diya tha
 i did not know how to drive a scooter at that time
 mainen us seen ko bas ek tech main kar diya tha
 But in 'chocolate n Duster' i had to make Shabana ji also
 isliye siikhnaa padaa

 When the police saw the CCTV footage, everyone was shocked to see what was revealed
 pataa chalaa ki gaurav ko ek senior chaatr ne paanch manjila hostal kii chat se phenkaa tha
 The accused student, Anand Bhadoria, studying in class X, told the police that he was instigated by Ashok, the warden of the hostel, for this task
 philhal anand or ashok donon hi jail kii salaakhon ke peeche hai
 Gaurav's father and mother Prabhadevi did not believe in suicide because Gaurav had told her several times that the warden beats her insolently
 ghatana ke ek din pehle bhi usne maa ko bataaya tha ki warden ne use peeta he
 All the CCTV cameras of the hostel were closed except for one, two days before the incident
 bhind ke espi anuraag kumaar bataate hai ki footage main anand ko sote hue gaurav ko uthaakar le jate saaf dekha ja saktaa he

 He also confessed to unnatural sex with Gaurav and told that Gaurav was the one to complain, so he conspired to kill

 But there were problems in extinguishing the fire due to narrowing of the surrounding roads
 jharkhand main purv mukhyamantri arjuna munda ke dwaara shuru kiye gaye mukhyamantri daal-bhaat yojana ko ab nae naam se janaa jayega
 Now it will be run under the name of Chief Minister Canteen Scheme
 is sambandh main nirnay rajya cabinet kii baithak main liya gaya
 It will start from Ranchi district

 Few centers are currently operational, as a matter of fact, the scheme was started during the chief ministership of Arjun Munda
 garib tabake ke log isse kaaphi labhanvit bhi ho rahe the
 But during the Chief Ministership of Hemant Soren, the plan began to eclipse
 kyonki rajya sarkaar ne is yojana ke liye fund ke aavanton main ruchi nahin lee
 Because of which only such ace-two centers are working
 lekinrghuvar sarkaarake nae faisle se is yojana ko nayaa jivan mila he
 Also, the way of getting food to the poor again for just five rupees will also be paved
 niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) ne 2008 main mobile seva companiyon ko license or 2ji spectrum ke aavantnon ke maamle main anil ambani samooh or anya audyogic gharaanon ko anuchit laabh pahunchane ke liye tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri e raja kii tikhi aalochana kii he
 The government auditor has said in a prepared report on this matter that Raja ignored the Prime Minister's advice in the allocation of 2G spectrum and 1 to the public exchequer
 76 lakh karod rupee se adhik kii aay kaa nuksaan karaayaa
 The CAG report was tabled in both houses of parliament on Tuesday
 report ke anusaar, raja kii 2ji spectrum niti se kai anya audyogic gharaanon unitech, datacom (ab videokan), es-tail, swaan or loop telikam ko anuchit phayda hua
 These companies were granted licenses in January 2008
 kaig ne kaha he ki uniphid acces sarvice license (yuaesel) ke aavanton kii puri prakriya main paardarshita kaa purnataya abhaav tha or yah puri prakriya manamaane, anuchit or sabhi ko samaan avasar muhaiyaa karaae bina puri kii gai

 us samay maujuud operataron ko 6
 On the allocation of spectrum beyond the 2 mhz contract limit, it has been said that Sunil Mittal's leadership benefited the most
 bharti ko 13 cirkilon main 32
 4 mhz spectrum given
 iske baad vodaphone essar ko 19
 6 mhz spectrum allocated
 kaig kaa anumaan he ki nae license jari karne par sarkaar ko 1
 There was a loss of revenue of Rs
 40 crores, while the allocation of additional spectrum to existing operators resulted in loss of revenue of Rs
 36,993 crores
 sansad main rakhi gai 77 pej kii report main kaha gaya he ki companiyon kii sahi haisiyat kaa sahi akalan nahin kiya gaya or yahaan tak ki doorsanchaar niamak tri kii siforeeshon ko bhi sahi bhaavana se nahin apanaaya gaya
 The report said that the arbitrary methods adopted for allocation of spectrum to 122 companies and issuing licenses to operate 35 dual technology services in 2007-08 resulted in an estimated revenue loss of Rs 1,76,645 crore to the government
 auditor ne yah anumaan haal main sarkaar dwaara kii gai 3ji spectrum kii nilaamee ke mulya ke aadhaar par lagaaya he
 The government has generated revenue of Rs 67,000 crore from the auction of 3G spectrum
 sarkari auditor ne kaha he ki aise main is baat kii jarurat he ki report main jin gadabadiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, unke liye javabdehi tay kii jaae
 Referring to flaws and irregularities, the report said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wanted a transparent and fair process for allocation of spectrum
 vahiin vitt mantralay kaa suzav tha ki spectrum kaa mulya mantriyon ke adhikaar praapt samooh (ijioem) ke saath vichaar-vimarsh ke baad tay kiye jaaen
 The CAG said that the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) issued 122 new licenses for 2G spectrum at the price of 2001 in 2008, ignoring all the concerns and suggestions and ignoring all the rules and procedures
 report main kaha gaya he ki dot ne license ke liye aavedan karne vaali companiyon kii haisiyat kaa bhi sahi akalan nahin kiya or is vajah se 122 licenson main 85 license aise aavedakon ko jari kar die gaye, jo iske paatr nahin the
 At the time of application, these companies did not meet the requirement of paid up capital
 sarkari auditor ke anusaar, in 85 license main se 45 license aisi companiyon ko jari kiye gaye jo memorondom aaf association (emoe) ke mukhya uddeshyon ko hi puraa nahin karti thim
 The CAG has also questioned the process of dual technology licensing granted to major telecom companies like Reliance Telecommunications and Tata Teleservices
 report main kaha gaya he ki dohari praudyogiki ke license jari karne kii prakriya main ‘paardarshita tathaa eemaandaaree’ kaa abhaav tha or isi tarah ke anya operataron ko samaan avasar nahin uplabdh karaae gaye
 These operators could apply for dual technology only after the formal announcement of the policy

 maahaul kharaab karne ke liye muslim kabhi jimmedaar nahindesh ke bahusankhyak hindu hinsa main vishwaas nahin kartah dhawanrajeev dhawan bole- faisle khule court main hone chahiesupreme court main ayodhya maamle main muslim paksh kii ore se joardaar daleelein pesh karne vaale varisht vakil rajeev dhawan kaa kahana he ki desh kii bahusankhyak hindu aabaadi hinsak nahin he, lekin sangh parivaar aisa karata rahaa he
 On the review, Dhawan said that it is a right and it indicates that there was a lapse in the judgment
 ayodhya maamle main supreme court kii ore se faisla aane ke baad india today ko pehali baar die apane intervyuu main rajeev dhawan ne apane us bayaan par hue vivaad ke baad safai di ki vah puure hindu samudaay kii baat nahin kar rahe the, sangh parivaar aisa karata rahaa he
 Dhawan had said in a TV interview recently that Muslims have never been responsible for spoiling the atmosphere in the country
 hindu aisa karte hai
 He said, 'I am not talking about the Hindu community
 meraa vishwaas he ki is samudaay main badi sankhya main aise log hai jo is tarah kii hinsa par vishwaas nahin karata he
 "I was introduced for Muslims and Hindus" Rajiv Dhawan said, "I was not introduced only for Muslims
 main badi sankhya main un hinduon ke liye bhi vakaalat kii jo libral seculirism main vishwaas karte hai
 It was a full court case
 yah maamla muslim banaam hindu ko lekar nahin tha
 It was a matter of protecting the constitutional fabric at stake
 ''hindu shanti bhang karte hai' par kya di safirajiv dhawan ne kaha, 'main nahin jaanata ki kisne meraa intervyuu liya tha
 And yesterday's interview was taken based on false facts
 jab maine kaha ki hindu, to iskaa matlab wo hindu jobabari masjidase jude maamalon main hinsa ke liye jimmedaar hai
 In court i have called violent Hindus as Hindu Taliban
 main apane bayaan par abhi bhi kaayam hum
 He further said, 'consider the last century, how much violence took place
 1934 main musalamaanon ne masjid kii raksha karne kii koshish kii or ise tod diya gaya
 It was encroached upon in 1949
 1950 or 1992 ke bich, hinduon kii ore se har aadesh kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 And then the Babri Masjid was demolished
 or main baar-baar yah kahuunga kibabari masjidase judi hinsa hindu hinsa thi or isaki taiyaari hindu taliban ke dwaara kii gai thi, lekin main us hinsa ko sangh parivaar or un sabhi sadasyon tak simit karata hum jinhone is hinsa kii taiyaari kii thi
 The temple will be built there and the manifesto said, 'I am not talking about the Hindu community
 main is samudaay se jude badi sankhya par vishwaas karata hum ki wo is tarah kii hinsa main vishwaas nahin karata
 "rajiv Dhawan said," When the case was going on hearing, no government or anybody had to speak about it
 jab vah kehete hai ki 'mandir vahiin banegaa' to yah court kii avmaananaa he
 He added, 'bjp's manifesto is not a holy book
 ghoshnaptr keval ram mandir ke bare main baat karata he
 It should be considered contempt of court
 adwani ab tarif chaahate hai, lekin kisi ko unhen bataanaa chahie ki vinaash sahi rasta nahin he
 His Rath Yatra was not to unite Hindus but to frighten Muslims
 'rivyuu pitishan adhikarrajeev dhawan ne kaha ki rivyuu sunni vakf board kii pasand he
 i would like to give an advice regarding the review that there can be no peace without judgment
 or muslim pakshon kii ore se abhi bhi yah nahin bataaya gaya ki unhen is faisle main kya-kya aapattiyaan hai
 Whether or not this verdict will succeed, but the review is a right and will reveal what is fundamentally wrong in the verdict
 supreme court ke faisle par rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki faisle ke baad shanti vyavastha banaae rakhana supreme court kaa kaam nahin he
 Article 142 of the constitution speaks of complete justice
 isliye supreme court kii jimmedaari yah sunishchit karne kii thi ki puraa nyaay kiya jaae, jo ki yahaan nahin hua
 Rajiv Dhawan said, 'I don't think that Chief Justice Justice Ranjan Gogoi should have spoken behind closed doors with the agencies maintaining security
 yah court ke parde ke peeche nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It was a simple question that they had to give a verdict and follow it at any cost
 sijeai or justise ashok bhushan kaa rajanetaaon or police ke saath koi sambandh nahin he, yah unka adhikaar kshetra bhi nahin he
 However all this happened at the time of the Ayodhya verdict
 yah puri tarah se galat tha
 The verdict should be in open court, it should not be enforced behind closed doors
 ' The functioning of Bihar Police has always been questioned
 aisa hi ek maamla he jahaan ek thanedaar jaanch ke liye duusare thanedaar ke chakkar kaat rahaa he
 After a major crime like gang rape, the police is open
 hajipur mahila thana kii gambhir laaparvaahee dekhne ko mili
 Railway police officers kept walking around the women's police station and the woman police officer was absent
 maamla tha ek naaballig yuvati ke saath auto driver dwaara apane saathi ke saath milakar gangrape karne kaa
 The 16-year-old girl, who was in an auto from Hajipur to Patna, was taken to a secluded place where the auto driver gang-raped the girl along with one of his companions
 ladki ne hajipur stesan par rail police ko ghatana kii jaankaree di to police ne aaropee auto driver ko giraftaar kar liya
 The girl left Chhapra for Patna and boarded an auto from Hajipur station to Patna
 ladki ko akeli dekh auto driver ne ek saathi ko auto main bitha liya or patna jane kii bajaay hajipur main ek sunsaan jagah le jaakar uske saath dushkarm kiya
 But the role of the police of the women's police station in this whole case was surprising
 der raat ke is puure ghatnakram main jahaan rail police ne peedita ke bayaan par aaropee ko giraftaar kiya or mahila kaa medical karaayaa, vahiin hajipur mahila thana kii police kii gambhir laaparvaahee dikhi
 Despite repeated calls by SHO of the railway station, the officers of the Mahila police station did not pick up the phone
 hairaan pareshaan rail thane ke adhikari peedita ko lekar mahila thana pahunche lekin thane kii haalat hairaan karne vaali thi
 Not only was the lock hanging on the room of the in-charge, the in-charge and other policemen were absent from the police station
 thane main ek bhi pulicekarmi najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 The comments rail thane ke prabharee imran alam ke anusaar, chunki naaballig bacchee ke saath gangrape jaisi gambhir vaardaat hui he, aise main mahila thana ke adhikariyon kii jaanch main anivaaryta rahati he, magar der raat se kai baar thane ke chakkar lagane ke baad bhi naa to koi padaadhikari thane par mil rahaa he naa hi koi phone tak uthaa rahaa he
 Now the condition of the police station is that a female employee is running away screaming after seeing the media camera, the wireless set of the police station is lying abandoned
 baharhaal is puure maamle main vaishali ke espi rakesh kumaar ne kaha he ki rail thane kii police ko likhit shikaayat dene ko kaha gaya he, iske baad karrwai kii jaaegi
 But the question is that when a police officer is forced to visit the police station, then what would happen to the common man
 lekin is puure maamle main mahila thane kii police kii bhoomika hairaan karne vaali thi
 In this whole incident of late night, where the police arrested the accused on the victim's statement and got the woman medical, the police of Hajipur Mahila police station showed serious negligence
 rail thane ke esechao baar-baar phone karne ke baavjood mahila thana ke adhikariyon ne phone tak nahin uthaaya
 Surprised, the officers of the troubled railway station reached the woman police station with the victim, but the condition of the police station was astonishing
 prabharee ke kamare par taala to lataka tha hi, prabharee or baaki pulicekarmi thane se nadaarat bhi the
 Not a single policeman was seen in the police station
 tippaniyan According to Imran Alam, in-charge of the railway station, since there has been a serious incident of gang-rape with the minor girl, the investigation of the officers of the woman police station is imperative, but even after several rounds of the police station late in the night, neither one Neither the officer is meeting at the police station nor is anyone picking up the phone
 ab thane kaa haal yah he ki ek mahila karmchaaree media ke camere ko dekh chillaate hue bhaag rahi he, thane kaa wireles set laavaaris padaa hua he
 However, in this entire case, Vaishali SP Rakesh Kumar has said that the police station has been asked to give a written complaint, after which action will be taken
 lekin sawaal ye he ki jab ek police adhikari thane kaa chakkar lagane ko majaboor ho rahaa he to aise main aam aadmi kaa kya hota hoga

 bharat ke khilaaf pakistan hameshaa nit nai chaalen chalata rahata he
 This time, a move by Pakistan has been revealed in which there has been a huge expose of alliances between the separatist leader and Pakistan
 or yah bharat ke liye badi chunauti ban sakati he
 The information that has come from the intelligence documents that Aaj Tak has is quite shocking
 report ke mutabik kashmir ghati menatankiyonki nai bhartee or training pakistan main dilaane ke liye algaavvaadi netaa apane sifarishi letters kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The arms training in Pakistan has been reported from the Khofia report that in this way, the separatist leaders are sending the youth of Kashmir valley to Pakistan to train them, and they are sent to India by brainwashing to create terror in the valley
 sifarish patr bana hathiyaarkhufia sutron ne jaankaree di he ki jis tareeke se bhartiya sena ghati main aatankiyon kooparation aloutke tahat dher kar rahi he, vaise hi pakistan baukhalaahat mechalgaavvaadeenetaon kii madad se aatankiyon ko trend karne kaa ye nayaa rasta akhriyaar kiya he
 According to the intelligence report, through the letter of recommendation from the separatists and Muslim religious leaders of the valley, the youth of Kashmir are obtaining valid travel documents for the training of weapons
 sutron ke mutabiq ghati main VTD yani Valid travel dacuments kii vyavastha over ground varkar (ogws)ke jariye karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Through the Valid travel documents, the youth of Kashmir valley easily cross the border
 khufia report se ye bhi khulaasa hua he ki pakistan ghati ke yuvaaon ko aatank main jhonkne ke liye inako 2 se 4 saptaah kii hathiyaaron kii training detaa he
 Crash Course of Terror Pakistan's Pakistan Agency ISI has named this method of training as 'crash Course of Terror'
 sutron ne ye bhi jaankaree di he ki valid travel dacuments paane se pehle kashmir yuvaaon ko ghati main maujuud videshi aatanki unka brinwash karte hai, baad main unako pakistan ke trennig camp main trend karne ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Regarding this new move of Pakistan, security expert and former DGMO Vinod Bhatia said, 'it is a matter of great concern to go to Pakistan with the letter head of the separatist leaders and take arms training there
 bharat sarkaar ko is par gaur farmana hoga
 'those who come from Pakistan should be monitored'
 Put them in a separate camp and keep an eye on them and reorient them
 unke anusaar, duusari sabase badi baat yah he ki pakistan jo line of control ke madhyam se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaata aata tha, vah ab aatanki ko seemapar nahin kara paa rahaa he
 Therefore, Pakistan has found a new way to take the letters of recommendation from the separatists and take them through valid visas and trend the terrorists
 paak is samay nae-nae tareekon kaa jo istemaal kar rahaa he
 To beat that, our security agencies will have to work on a large scale, those who are coming back should also be checked
 paak ke ishaare par algaavvaadivahin pike sahagal ne kaha ki pichley kai saalon se safataur par yah najar aa rahaa he ki algaavvaadi kis tareeke se pakistan ke ishaare par kaam kar rahe hai
 He is a traitor whoever goes through a big mess in Kashmir is directly and indirectly behind them
 unhone kaha ki hamaare paas jo jaankaree he uske mutabik har friday prere ke baad mirwij jaise bade netaa kashmir ke yuvaaon ko bhadakaate hai or uksaate hai
 When the separatist leaders are provoking the youth of Kashmir in this way, why should the Indian government give them visas on their letters in this manner? pike sahagal ne kaha ki hamaare paas jo jaankaree he uske mutabik over ground varkar kii madad se yah saare log algaavvaadiyon ke sifarishi patr ke aadhaar par pakistan jane kaa valid document paa jate hai jiske jariye yah pakistan jate hai or vahaan par inako hathiyaaron kii training di jaati he yahaan tak ki kai baar wagha border kaa bhi istemaal pakistan jane ke liye karaayaa jaataa he
 Before the challenge for the government, let us tell you that the youth of Kashmir had to cross the line of control and after that they would go to Pakistan and train them, but now they have found an easy way through the letter head of the separatists and There is no doubt and doubt on him through this simple method, he goes straight to Pakistan, taking a valid visa and from there takes arms training
 And after taking this training, they spread terror in Kashmir valley
 unhen to yah lagata he yah badi ajeebogareeb baat he ki sarkaar isko itane dinon tak isko kyon nazarandaaj karti rahi
 Our demand is that now the time has come that the Central Government and the State Government should not accept the recommencement of any separatist leader on the basis of which the youth of Kashmir has been sent to Pakistan, trying to take the wrong advantage against India
 Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI is also involved in this

 com / ju6w47pecc gaadi se principal ko kuchalane ke maamlemen BJP saansad ranvijay singh judev ke bhai vikramaditya kii talash tej kar di gai he
 Chhattisgarh police are looking for him in three states
 mangalvaar ko hivikramaditya par paanch hajaar rupee kaa inaamaghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 But till now the police have not got any success
 is puure maamle main kai bade sawaal khadey hote hai
 The biggest question is why the whole action was so late? At first the case was not registered for 24 hours
 uske baad judev bhaag gaya
 The most surprising thing is that Vikramaditya Judev already has many cases registered
 usamen bhi vikramaditya ko pehle hi police ne pehle faraar ghoshit kiya he
 The question is that even after this, how was he roaming in Jashpur and how did he carry out this incident against the principal? ipel main apane pradarshan se sabakaa man mohane vaale karne vaale royal chalangers bangaleru (aaarasibi) ke sabase yuva ballebaaj sarfaraj khan kaa kahana he ki unhen ipel main plaing-11 team main jagah milane kii ummid nahin thi
 The 17-year-old Sarfaraz said he was not sure of a place in the playing-11 among batsmen like Chris Gayle, de Villiers and Virat Kohli, and his confidence is in seventh position given the chance at the very important number 6 position
 uttar pradesh ke azamgarh sthit apane pushtaini gaanv basoopar pahunche sarfaraj ne news agency se phone par baatcheet main kaha ki ipel kaa unka pehla satr bahut acha rahaa
 During this, all the senior players helped him a lot
 is baar ipel ke sabase kam umr ke ballebaaj ne kaha ki duniya ke sabase khatarnaak ballebaajon se saji aaarasibi kii batting linep main jagah milane kii unhen ummid nahin thi, lekin yah jarur sochaa tha jis din mauka milegaa, antim 11 main jagah pakki kar lenge
 The right-handed batsman Sarfarajne, who was bought by RCB for Rs 50 lakhs, said, 'no one gets a chance to bat at number six
 us number par aam taur par senior or anbhavi khilaadiyon ko mauka diya jaataa he
 The batsman of that number has the most pressure
 main khushnaseeb hum ki mujhe us sthaan par ballebaaji kaa mauka mila
 With this my confidence reached the seventh sky, but my feet are the ground
 'shandaar gendbaajon se saji rajasthan royles ke khilaaf lig mukaable main 21 gendon par 45 ran banaakar sabko chaunkaane vaale is ballebaaj ne kaha, 'gail, devilliars or kohli ne mujhe ballebaaji ke kai gur sikhaye
 In the coming time, i will work with them in mind
 isse meraa khel nikharegaa, isaki mujhe puri ummid he

 a woman declared dead in the attack is alive
 somvaar ko hamale ke baad sabhi ghayalon ko anantnag ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 After this, the Jammu and Kashmir Police released the list of those who died in the attack
 is list main hasuben ratilal patel kaa naam bhi shaamil tha
 But on Tuesday, information has come out that Hasuben is safe
 hasuben ke pati kii mautadrasal, amarnath tirthayatriyon se bhari jo bas somvaar shaam srinagar se jammu kii taraf aa rahi thi, hasuben patel bhi usee bas main savaar thim
 Apart from Hasuben, her husband Ratilal Patel was also present in the bus
 aatankiyon kii golibari main ratilaal patel ko gambhir chot ain or unki maut ho gai
 Ratilal was shot in the head
 vahiin husben ko halki chot ai hai or wo surakshit hai
 Laxmiben Patel's death, and the family of Laxmiben Patel of Valsad, it is difficult to believe that she is no longer in this world
