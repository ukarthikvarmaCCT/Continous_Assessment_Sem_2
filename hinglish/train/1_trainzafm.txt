 President Pakistan's spokesman Farhatullah Babar clarified that only hours after news came yesterday of the release of Sarabjit Singh by the government of Pakistan, who was convicted in Pakistan for his involvement in several incidents of the 1990 bombings and facing the death penalty
 Surjit Singh is taking steps to release another Indian prisoner, who was jailed in a case of espionage
 ‘da express tribune’ ne pehle panne par apni report main kaha he ki galat pahchaan ke maamle ko lekar pakistan antarrashtriya sharmindagi kii sthiti main aa gaya he
 The website of the Dawn newspaper has described the development as a "u-turn" of the government in a unique way
 raashtrapati ke pravaktaa ne is gadabadi ko ‘bhram’ bataaya or is prakaran se raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ko alag karne kii koshish kii he
 Babar said that any mention of the President in the case was 'out of context'
 haalanki, soshal media or khaastaur par twitor par is baat kii atakalein thi ki kya sarkaar ko shaktishaalee suraksha pratishthan se dabaav ke kaaran sarbajit ko mukt karne ke kisi bhi sambhavit kadam se palatney par majaboor hona padaa
 The Pakistani military plays an important role in deciding foreign policy, especially in terms of relations with India and the US
 ‘da express tribune’ kii report main kaha gaya he ki yah spasht nahin he ki yah gadabadi kaise hui
 Was there a mistake in giving information on behalf of the authorities or there was a failure in reporting on behalf of the media
 pakistani televijan samachar channelon ne kal dopaher sabase pehle khabar di ki raashtrapati ne sarbajit kii maut kii sajaa aaajeevan karawas main tabdeel kar di he or adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya he ki agar sarbajit ne apane karawas kii sajaa puri kar lee he to ve use reeha karne ke liye kadam uthaaen
 The President's spokesman then told at least two Indian news channels and the Western Dialogues Committee that the government was taking steps to release Sarabjit
 sarkaar ne spasht taur par palati mangalvaar raat takreeban saadhe gyaarah baje (sthaneey samyaanusaar) maari jab raashtrapati ke pravaktaa ne pushti kii ki sarbajit ko nahin balki surajeet ko reeha kiya janaa he kyonki uski maut kii sajaa 1989 main hi aaajeevan karawas main tabdeel kar di gai thi or usne apane karawas kii sajaa puri kar lee he
 The news of Sarabjit's release also dominated the much-watched talk show in Pakistan and the country's most popular anchor Hamid Mir called Sarabjit the 'ajmal Kasab of India'
 kasaab saal 2008 ke mumbai hamale main sanlipt ekmaatr aatankwaadi he, jise jivit pakadaa gaya gaya tha
 By this morning, most Pakistani television news channels had stopped reporting on the disturbances regarding Sarabjit
 jeeyo channel jaise kuch channelon par videsh mantri es em krishna kii ore se sarbajit or pakistani jelon main band anya bhartiya kaidiyon ko reeha karne kii khabaron ko dikhaaya gaya
 At least three newspapers have not published news of the mess in the identity of Indian prisoners and they have published news on their front page that Sarabjit is to be released on the orders of the President
 sarbajit or surajeet donon philhal lahore ke kot lakhapat jail main band hai
 Sarabjit was accused of involvement in the bombings that killed 14 people in the Punjab province, while Surjeet was arrested for espionage during the tenure of former military ruler zia-ul-haq

 It was a profitable company at a consolidated level and the sale of Mindtree's shares to L&T was aimed at taking the debt to repayable levels
 iske alaava unki sampatti unke karj se kai guna adhik thi
 Those who knew him well have questioned the authenticity of the suicide letter
 ve us patr par hastakshar ko sandigdh maanate hai
 Amidst the cloud of mystery, some questions have also arisen about the time of suicide — why did he actually sign the letter two days before committing suicide and leave it? Did he plan it in advance? The letter mentions two reasons for the pressure — the Income Tax Department and a private equity shareholder — and questions about it remain unanswered

 Although Kejriwal is seeking public votes every day for the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections, but campaigning in Rajouri Garden has different meanings
 darasal rajouri garden main vidhansabha seat kaa upachunaav nau april ko hona he
 The seat was won by the Aam Aadmi Party in the 2015 elections but MLA Jarnail Singh resigned from the legislature to contest the assembly elections in Punjab

 It is also a sikh-punjabi dominated seat
 tippaniyan The result of this seat will indicate what is the status of the common man in Delhi
 iske alaava 23 april ko dilli nagar nigam ke chunaav ke liye yah upachunaav kisi opinian pole se kam nahin hoga
 For this seat, the party's biggest leaders of Punjab HS Phoolka and Sanjay Singh have campaigned but Kejriwal will go for the first time
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi-akali dal ne yahaan manjinder singh sirsa or congress ne minakshi chandila ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 Actually, the by-election for the assembly seat in Rajouri Garden is to be held on April 9
 yah seat 2015 ke chunaav main aam aadmi party ne jiti thi lekin vidhayak jaranel singh ne punjab main vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye vidhayaki se istipha de diya tha
 Now after losing elections in Punjab, this seat has become a nose question for the Aam Aadmi Party
 yah ek sikh-punjabi bahul seat bhi he
 The comments is seat kaa nateeja sanket degaa ki dilli main aam aadmi kii kya sthiti he
 Apart from this, this by-election for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on April 23 will be no less than an opinion poll
 is seat par prachaar ke liye party ke punjab ke sabase bade netaa eches phulka or sanjay singh prachaar kar chuke hai lekin kejariwal pehali baar prachaar ke liye jaaenge

 Poet George Herbert had rightly said that a father is more important than hundreds of schoolteachers
 bhale hi padhai or rojgaar ke kaaran ham apane pita se dur rahete hai lekin choti se choti baat par unase salaah lenaa abhi bhi nahin bhoolatey hai
 Know that such things of your father as soon as possible, we must be included in our lives
 1
 Take care of every member of the family: Papa knows everything whether the family is big or small
 wo har ek point par maujuud hote hai jahaan unki jarurat hoti he
 If they are not able to exist for any reason, they still make their presence felt
 pariwarik jimmedaari kaise nibhaai jaati he isaki training jitne achche tarah se papa sikhaa sakate hai, utana koiinstitutebhi nahin bataa saktaa he
 Fathers are the first students of how to keep others happy
 2
 Forgive: Yes, most of us sit at the heart of someone else's mistakes and rarely forgive anyone
 agar duniya ke saare pita bhi aise ho jaaen to bacchon kaa kya hoga? yah sochane vaali baat he
 We must learn this quality from our father
 3
 Hard work: Most of the world's fathers are hardworking
 yahi nahin, unkimehnatamen ek or cheez shaamil hoti he wo he 'samay kaa paband hona'
 They also do not miss doing risky jobs to meet their family's needs
 4
 Learning from others: Dad never hesitate to learn something from others
 chaahe maamla gagetts kaa ho yaa ganit kaa
 They do not hesitate to learn from anyone
 dusron se seekhney kaa yah gun hameshaa safalataa kii raah par le jaataa he
 5
 haar ke baad hi jeet he:kai barpariwaarake saamne museebataan aati he, aise samay main pita bahut hi soch-samajhakar kadam uthaate hai or dhairya banaae rakhte hai
 At the time of difficulties, he always teaches that to learn the way forward
 jeet jarur milegi

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif pichley hafte hi pakistan kii sarajameen se aatank or aatankwaad ko khatm karne kaa dam bhar rahe the
 Then why has Pakistan kept three big names of terror in its lap? Attack on Pakistani school, Indian martyrs' rites when their tears fall, they dry on their land
 hamaare aansu jab girte hai to hamaari jameen ke daaman par sookhte hai
 Because there is no religion of tears, there is no caste of pain and there is no area of gum
 1993 ke baad seemapar se band nahin hua aatank1993 kaa mumbai dhamaakaa wo pehla aisa aatankwaadi hamalaa tha jisane pakistan ko sidhe katghare main khadaa kar diya tha
 Since then, this trend has continued in the last 23 years
 naa jane hindustan ke kitne shahar jakhmi or chalni ho gaye par pakistan ke raste hindustan aane vaala aatank band nahin hua
 In fact, the army and the ISI have been more responsible for making Pakistan the base of terror than the government there
 pakistan par aatank ke aakaaon kaa kabjayehi asli matlab he pakistan kaa
 Pak is a Persian word while location is Hindi
 in donon shabdon ko mila kar bana tha pakistan
 But now it has become a base of terror
 aatankwaadiyon kaa panaahagaah
 After all, how did a whole country get caught in the clutches of terror? How terrorist organizations and their masters captured an entire country? Before knowing the many wounds that are on the chest of India, remember any injured city in India, listen to the moaning of Mumbai in 93
 sabase hare jakhm uri kii aah mahasoos kiijie
 Remember the names of terrorist organizations and their masters
 desh ke sabase bade bhagaude don ke bare main sochie
 Consider the end of the world's largest terrorist before Baghdadi
 kashmir main jhankie to jawaab mil jayega
 The Mumbai attack was the first warhandistan's biggest and first wound of terror in 1993 as the bloodshed of Mumbai
 puure mumbai ko dhamaakon se dahala dene vaala cheharaa tabhi aam ho gaya tha
 But David Abraham had secretly escaped by then

 That is, in Pakistan

 He was the head of Al Qaeda
 puure das saal tak america isaki talash main duniya bhar kii khaak chaanati rahi par aakhir main ye bhi mila usee aatank ke adde main, yani pakistan main or vahiin maaraa gaya
 Terrorists roam freely in Pakistan
 On the map of the world, there are all those maps of Pakistan where the factory of terror runs
 jahaan aatankwaadiyon ke training camp hai
 Terrorists like Hafiz Saeed, Maulana Masood Azhar have never been able to hide in Pakistan
 khullamakhulla ghoomte hai ye pakistan main
 His sown reaping is the old saying that a person reaps what he sows
 aatank kii aag main buree tarah jhulas rahe padosi mulk kii kahani kuch aisi hi he
 In Pakistan at different times, different rulers and army used terrorism for their own benefit
 ab nateeja ye he ki vahi aatankwaad sabase zyaada ab khud pakistan ko lahooluhaan kar rahaa he
 No one knows exactly where the list of such terror attacks and deaths due to terrorism in Pakistan itself begins and ends
 or isaki vajah bhi sidhi si he, pakistan main kab kahaan kaise or kidar se aatankwaadi hamalaa ho jaae, ye na to vahaan kii police ko pataa he, na suraksha agenciyon ko or na hi gaddi par baithe siyaasi hukmaranon ko or yahi vajah he ki aaj duniya pakistan ko aatank kii jananath kah kar pukaarane lagi he
 However, there is also a reality that Pakistan, which shelters terrorists on its own land, is now itself the biggest victim of it
 kya hoga pakistan kaa bhavishyalekin ye sabakuch jaanate hue bhi pakistani hukmran, vahaan kii fouj or iesai jaisi agenciyaan apane-apane makasad kii khatir dehshatgardi ke khilaaf sanjeeda nahin he
 Rather, sometimes they start crying, calling themselves victims of terrorism and sometimes blaming others
 aise main pakistan kaa aanevaala kal khushnuma hoga, philhal is baat kii koi ummid najar nahin aati
 What is the truth of Pakistan's biggest operation? In the United Nations, Nawaz Sharif claimed that Pakistan conducted the world's largest and successful operation against terrorism
 darasal pakistan kii god main baithe do sabase bade aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar or jaish ke khilaaf ye oparation kabhi chalaaya hi nahin gaya
 Sharif stood in the UN and said that Pakistan's biggest and successful operation against terror was done by Pakistan only, then the truth comes out through the figures of their own agency
 sabase bade aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin8 june 2014 ko karachi ke jinna international airport par aatankwaadi hamale main 28 log maare gaye the
 a week after this attack, on 15 June 2014, Mian Saheb started Operation zarb-e-azb by forming a team of 30,000 special soldiers of the Pak Army
 iske tahat khaas taur par taharik-e-taliban pakistan, islamic muvament of uzbekistan, east turkistan islamic network, lashkar-e-jhangavi, al-kaayda, junadalla or hakkaani network ke khilaaf muhim chhedi gai
 But look amazing, no action was ever taken against lashkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-mohammed and d Company
 jabaki antarrashtriya str par in teenon ko naa sirf aatankwaadi sanghathan or aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he balki inke sir par inaam bhi he
 In fact, from the very beginning, a large section in the Pakistani army has been a supporter of radical Islamic organizations, which has always been a big help to the ISI
 pakistan kii anduruni raajnneeti main bhi inaki kaaphi majboot pakad he
 These fundamentalist religious organizations create a crop of terror in the name of Islam and Jihad and they have made Pakistan an obstacle to terror
 haal hi main soni sab tivi kaa sabase popular sho tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma ke ek seen ko lekar mache bavaal ke chalate serial ko bain karne kii khabaren ain thim
 What did it show in the last serial that the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) demanded an immediate ban on the serial? If sources are to be believed, SGPC chief Kripal Singh Badungar said that the show led the tenth Sikh Guru Govind Singh Filming the living form hurt the Sikh community and doing so is against Sikh principles

 Munmun has also said that Gurcharan, who is seen in the role of Guru Govind, himself comes from the Sikh community, he cannot do anything himself which hurts the sentiments of the Sikh community
 mujhe achche se yaad he ki us sikvence kii shooting ke din bhi unhone kaha tha ki kisi ko bhi shri guru govind singh ji kaa role adaa karne kii anumati nahin he
 Munmun further said, 'tarak Mehta's upside is the beauty of glasses that it has people of every culture and religion
 to ham hameshaa is baat kaa dhyaan rakhte hai ki kabhi bhi hamaare dialog yaa act kii vajah se kisi kii bhavanaaen naa aahat ho jaae
 This show has been the favorite show of the audience for 9 years
 ham kabhi nahin chahenge ki isaki vajah se desh main kisi kii bhi bhaavana ko thes pahunche
 People who are objecting to this have not seen that episode correctly
 main chaahati hum ki vah us episod ko dekhen jahaan sodi ye kah rahe hai ki wo unke khalsa he
 'taarak Mehta Ki' Babita ji's relationship with this Bollywood actor, opposite Mehta's inverted glasses, the makers of the show have also clarified on the whole matter saying that some people have misunderstood the scene of the show
 sho ke seen kaa uddeshy kisi bhi samudaay ko thes pahunchaana nahin tha

 After Uttarakhand's 2017 assembly elections, former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna was seen as politically inactive
 lekin ab jab loksabhaa chunaavon kii ranbheri baj chuki he to rajya ke nikaay chunaavon main vijayi pratyaashiyon ke sammaan main dinar party yojit karke unhone apni rajnatik sakriyata badha di he
 His activism has once again warmed up the politics of the state, especially in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 bahuguna kii is dinar diplomasi ko tehri loksabhaa seat se unki daavedaari ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Bahuguna has previously been an MP from this seat
 dehradun main 19 janvari ko yojit unki dinar party main mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat, cabinet mantri prakaash pant, subodh uniyaal, spikar premuchandra agarwal, vidhayak ganesh joshi, munna singh chouhan, sahadev pundir, harbans kapur, umesh sharma kau, kunwar pranav champion, dehradun nagar nigam ke navnirvaachit meyar sunil uniyaal gamma or rishikesh nagar nigam kii navnirvaachit meyar anitha mamgaai samet kai ahm log maujuud rahe
 In 2016, under the leadership of Bahuguna, nine mlas left the Congress and joined the BJP
 baad main is fehrist main do or vidhayak shaamil ho gaye the
 But after the 2017 assembly elections, Bahuguna spent most of his time in Delhi
 pichley dinon jab uttarakhand main rajyasabha kii seat khaali hui to unhen bhaajapa kii ore se upree sadan main bhejne kii charchaaon ne jor pakadaa
 But later Anil Baluni, who was liked by Narendra Modi, snatched this opportunity from him
 haalanki tehri se apni daavedaari ko lekar unhone abhi kuch bhi sanket dene se gurej kiya
 He said that he will announce his strategy for the Lok Sabha elections in March
 asal main, party ke bahaane bahuguna loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apane samarthakon or kareebi netaaon ko yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki ve taiyaar rahen
 Bahuguna revolted in 2016 only because of his disregard in Congress
 jaahir he, is baar bhaajapa main sugabugahat he ki kahin bahuguna party ke liye koi kathor kadam na uthaa len
 The involvement of most important leaders in the dinner party, including the Chief Minister, also shows that the BJP has taken it seriously
 haalanki trivendra ravat ne ise saamaanya baat bataate hue kaha ki iske koi or nihitarth nahin nikaale jane chahie
 But the BJP MP from Tehri, Maharani Mala Rajyalakshmi Shah, did not reach the dinner
 unhone in atakalon par aitraaj jataayaa he ki tehri se bahuguna daavedaari kar rahe hai
 Rajyalakshmi said that her first claim from Tehri was
 pichley dinon bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta ne kaha tha ki rajya main bhaajapa ke paanchon saansad hi phir se agle loksabhaa chunaav maidan main utrenge
 But Bahuguna's statement of whether he will contest the election or not will be announced in March, questioning Bhatt's statement
 aise main bahuguna kii dinar party ko lekar bhaajapa main uthaa tufaan philhal thanda hota nahin dekh rahaa

 is par, vivek ne tapaak se kaha ki yadi aisa hua to juute waapas dene ke evaj main sush jo bhi maangengi, unhen de denge
 However, in response to a question, Sushmita made it clear that she has not got her Krishna yet, she will definitely tell when she gets it

 People make mistakes but being able to own up and take responsibility takes guts

 they deserve a 2nd chance and hopefully get the right support around them now
 
 Takes a lot guts to do what they did today

 Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikarka has been decided to join the Narendra Modi cabinet
 samajha jaataa he ki bijepi unke sambhavit uttaradhikari ke taur par teen naamon kaa chayan karegi
 a senior party leader gave this information on Friday
 bijepi ke vidhayak dal kii ek baithak shuukravaar ko poravorim main hogi, jisamen up-mukhyamantri francis di’suja, rajya ke swasthya mantri lakshmikant parasekar or vidhansabha adhyaksh rajendra arlekar ke naamon kii parrikar ke uttaradhikari ke taur par sifarish kii jaaegi
 Confirming these three names, a senior party official said that the BJP Parliamentary Board will make a formal announcement about it after its meeting in New Delhi on Saturday
 is bich, goa kii rajdhani panaji main raat bhar gahan raajnneetik charchaaon or baithkon kaa daur jari rahaa
 All the BJP mlas gathered in a hotel overnight
 haalanki guuruuvaar der raat band kamare main hui baithak se baahar nikalne ke baad bijepi kii rajya ikai ke adhyaksh vinay tendulkar ne kaha ‘yah garv kii baat he ki parrikar ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he or desh kaa raksha mantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 But we will definitely miss their shortfall here in Goa
 ’ unhone parrikar ke sambhavit uttaradhikari ke taur par chune gaye naamon ke bare main bataane se inkaar kar diya lekin kaha ‘yah pad sakasham vyakti ko diya jayega
 Breaking his silence on the news about the possibility of his appointment as Defense Minister, Parrikar had said on Thursday that BJP President Amit Shah had told him that if the Center gives him any responsibility, he should take it up
 iske baad unhone yah jimmedaari apane kandhon par lene kii ichha jataai
 Parrikar, 58, of the BJP, who was instrumental in leading the party to victory in the Assembly elections in Goa, became emotional in announcing his exit from state politics
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘main pad chhodte hue vyathit hum
 But for me the country is bigger than the state
 mere andar mila-jula ahsaas he
 Later in the evening when Parrikar met a select few party workers in Panaji, his eyes fluttered
 apni bhaawanaaon ko kaabo karne main naakaam rahe parrikar ne sankshipt sambodhan main kaha, ’main isliye dilli ja rahaa hum kyonki unhone mujhase nai jimmedaari lene ko kaha he
 Whenever Goa needs it, i will always be available for it
 ’ baithak samaapt karte hue unhone kaha ‘agar main or boluungaa to or bhavuk ho jaaoongaa
 During a conversation with a news channel late on Thursday night, Parrikar said that if he is selected for the new responsibility in Delhi, he will miss 'fish Curry Rice'
 - input bhashaa se Nitish Kumar, who raised his land in Bihar elections by raising the flag against communalism, has remembered the temples just before the announcement of elections
 yahi nahin, mukhyamantri ne rajya main ek baar phir jatigat raajnneeti kaa card khelaa he
 Taking two important decisions, the state cabinet recently approved the fund for the construction of the temple boundary, while deciding to include the Mallah, Nishad and Nonia castes among the Scheduled Tribes
 rajya cabinetki shanivaar ko hui baithak main ise manjuuri di gai
 To include the Mallah, Nishad (bind, Beldar, Chandi, Tier, Khulwat, Surihaya, Godhi, Vanpar and Kewat) and Nonia castes in the list of scheduled caste of Bihar in view of their economic, political, educational and employment backwardness It was decided to send the recommendation to the Central Government
 mandiron kii suraksha ke babat faislacabinet sachiv shishir sinha ne sarkaar ke faisle kii pushti kii he
 a senior JDU leader reacting to the government's move said, 'earlier, the government released a fund for the construction of fences around the mosques
 Wants to deliver
 'haalanki netaji ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar kii ore se yah faisla kaaphi pehle liya janaa chahie tha
 Because the settlement of the dispute over the land of the temples would have sent the right message in the society
 sarkaar kaa mat he ki aisa mandiron kii suraksha ke babat kiya gaya he
 All dms of the state have been empowered to mark such temples for the protection of the precious metal or idol
 dm kii report par bhawan nirmaan vibhaag charadivari karaayega
 The second decision of the Nitish cabinet is being linked to the caste equation in the state
 yah dilachasp he ki jahaan beete shuukravaar ko rajdhani main nishad jati ko anusuchit jan jati main shaamil kiye jane kii maang ko lekar chal rahe pradarshan par police ne laathiyaan bhanji, vahiin sarkaar ne agle hi din ise apni cabinet baithak main paas kar diya
 With this decision of the government, more than one crore population will get the benefit of the facilities provided to the Scheduled Castes
 ek lambey arase se nishad, mallaah or nonia jati ko anusuchit jati main shaamil kiye jane kii maang uth rahi thi
 Earlier, the government approved the inclusion of the Lohar caste in the Scheduled Castes and the Teli, Tamoli and Chaurasia castes in the Most Backward Castes
 'nishadon kii rijhaane kii chaal'bijepike varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne sarkaar ke is kadam ko sajeesh qaraar diya he
 He said, 'this is nothing but a conspiracy to woo Nishad
 unhen beete 10 varshon se koi laabh nahin diya gaya
 How can the Nitish government combine Nishad into the Dalit caste, while this is a constitutional method and can be done only through amendment by the Center
 'bijepi ke netaa or mujffarpur se saansad ajay nishad kaa aarope he ki nitish kumaar kii sarkaar nishad samudaay ko raajnneeti ke khel main footbal kii tarah istemaal kar rahi he

 Everyone is praising the actor's performance and looks in the Ranbir Kapoor starrer 'sanju'
 lekin salmaan se jab ranbir kii acting ke bare main poocha gaya to unka kahana tha ki film kaa aakhri hissaa khud sanjay dutt ko karnaa chahie tha
 Ranbir Kapoor's reaction has now come to light on this statement of Dabangg Khan
 unhone kaha, ''aisa kabhi nahin hua he ki kisi shaks ne khud apni byopic main kaam kiya ho
 By doing this, the effect of the character is eliminated
 mujhe pataa he ki meri tulana sanjay dutt se kii jaaegi
 That is why i have worked hard and tried to do justice to the character
 ''kis vajah se 'sanju' main salmaan khan ko pasand nahin aa rahi ranbir kapur kii acting?unhone aage kaha, ''chaahe log mujhe 40 saal ke sanjay dutt ke rup main dekhe yaa 20 saal ke, unhen aisa laganaa chahie ki wo ek kalakaar ko dekh rahe hai, jo sanjay dutt kaa role nibhaa rahaa he
 It is true that i cannot become another Sanjay Dutt
 ''bataa den ki salmaan khan ne kaha tha, ''yadi film ke baad vaale hisse main sanjay dutt kaa kirdaar khud sanjay ne nibhaayaa hota to behatar hota
 For 'sanju' i felt why someone else is doing it to such an extent? The last 8–10 years roll
 aap iske saath nyaay nahin kar sakate
 "crazy fans watching Salman in Race-3, dance inside the theater had said -" Sanju himself had to play the last part

 vah 10 disambar 1988 kaa din tha jab 15 saal ke kishor sachin tendulkar ne pratham shrenee match khilne ke liye maidan par kadam rakhaa or agle din apana pehla shatak jadaa
 After this, centuries were added in the name of Tendulkar, but even after 22 years, the king of the centuries is waiting for the first triple century
 tendulkar ne in 22 varshon main ballebaaji ke kai record apane naam kiye lekin kai aise record bhi hai jo hameshaa unki jad se baahar rahenge
 The Indian run machine has so far scored 99 in international cricket, 78 in first-class cricket and 138 centuries in all three formats, but does not include triple centuries
 master blaster se jab haal main is bare main sawaal kiya gaya tha to unka saral jawaab tha ki unhen bhi prayek ballebaaj kii tarah ran bananaa pasand he or vah bhi tihara shatak jamaana chaahate hai
 However, Tendulkar has always preferred the team over personal achievements
 tendulkar kaa test cricket main sarvocch score naabad 248 ran he jo unhone bangladesh ke khilaaf 2004 main dhaka main banaaya tha
 It is also his highest score in first-class cricket, which means that this star batsman has never touched the 250-run mark yet
 unke naam par test maichon main chah dohare shatak darj hai lekin inamen se kuch avasaron par hi vah tihare shatak banane kii sthiti main pahunche the
 When he scored the highest score of his career against Bangladesh, the entire team was out and he was unbeaten at the other end
 tendulkar ke paas 2010 main srilanka ke khilaaf colombo main tihara shatak banane kaa acha mauka tha lekin tab vah 203 ran banaakar out ho gaye the
 India had scored more than 100 runs even after their dismissal
 tendulkar haalanki jab keval 14 saal ke the tab unhone schuli cricket main tihara shatak jamaaya tha
 He scored an unbeaten 326 at the Azad Maidan against St Xavier School for Shardashram Vidyamandir
 yah vahi match tha jisamen kambli or tendulkar ne ricard 664 ran kii saajhedaari kii thi
 The triple century is still in Tendulkar's JD but there are many records from which the King of Miles is behind
 inamen pratham shrenee cricket main sarvaadhik ran (61760) or sarvaadhik shatak (199) kaa jaik habs kaa ricard, wilfred rods kaa 30 saal kaa antarrashtriya karier or 1110 pratham shrenee match khilne kaa record tathaa bryan lara kaa pratham shrenee (naabad 501) or test match (naabad 400 ran) kii sarvocch pari kaa record pramukh he
 Tendulkar has played 280 first-class matches so far in which he has scored 23585 runs
 isamen 78 shatak or 105 ardhashatak shaamil hai
 Most fifties in first-class cricket are named after Frank Woolley (295)

 If the 'land for Railway Hotel' scam leads to the arrest of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Yadav along with his son Tejashwi Yadav, what will happen to the deputy cm's post in Bihar's Nitish government? This question is in everyone's mind
 darasal isaki ashanka land for hotel cese main sibiai kii ore se file kii gai exiaar main lalu or tejasvi kaa naam hone se bani he ki donon netaaon kii giraftaar ho sakati he
 According to sources associated with the RJD supremo, Laloo has prepared Plan b to deal with any situation
 is plan ke tahat agar sibiai tejasvi yadav ko giraftaar karti he, to lalu apane bade bete or bihar ke swasthya mantri tej pratap yadav ko tejasvi kii jagah dipti siem kii post par bitha sakate hai
 According to Lalu's plan-behindustan Times report, a senior RJD leader said that if the hierarchy is seen, Tej Pratap Yadav is currently at number three due to being health minister
 kisi bhi apaat sthiti main unhen number do par pramot kiya ja saktaa he
 On the condition of anonymity, he said that Tej Pratap Yadav is not an accused in the 'land for Hotel' scam
 unhone spasht karte hue kaha ki lalu parivaar ke alaava nitish sarkaar main koi or upmukhyamantri nahin ho saktaa
 This post equivalent to a cabinet minister was created in November 2015 after the Grand Alliance government came to power in Bihar
 mahagathbandhan main congress, lalu or jadyu sahabhaagi hai
 Tejashwi will not resign, RJD had unanimously decided that Tejashwi Yadav would not resign from his post after Tejashwi's name appeared in the register FIR on behalf of the CBI in the Votes for Lease scam
 haalanki bijepi lagaataar nitish kumaar par tejasvi yadav or tej pratap yadav ko hataane ke liye jor daal rahi he
 In a press conference held on Friday, Tejashwi Yadav himself pointed this out
 duusari ore shanivaar ko rajd netaaon ne isaki pushti kar di
 RJD sources said that the party's strategy is weight and watch
 party dekhnaa chaahati he ki lalu ke donon beton ko mantri parishad se hataane kii bijepi kii maang par nitish kumaar kya faisla lete hai
 RJD leader gave example of Uma Bharti
 One RJD leader said, 'we do not know whether the Chief Minister demands Tejashwi's resignation on the basis of an FIR lodged by the CBI
 lekin hamaara stand clear he
 Tejashwi Yadav will not resign from himself
 ' rajd netaa ne uma bharti kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ki aapraadhik cese main chargeshit hone ke baavjood kendriya mantri pad par bani hui hai
 Nitish Kumar's difficulties may increase in the coming days after the rjd's clear attitude towards Lalu's sons
 yahi kaaran he ki jadyu netaa shuukravaar ko sibiai kii chhapemari ke bare main kuch bol nahin rahe hai
 The Congress supported Lalu
 It is interesting that the third party of the Grand Alliance is in open support of Congress Lalu Yadav and his family members
 bihar congress president or shiksha mantri ashok choudhary ne shanivaar ko kaha ki jab deal hui to tejasvi yadav naaballig the, phir unka naam exiaar main kyon shaamil kiya gaya he
 According to sources, the Congress needs the RJD mlas and mps in view of the presidential elections on July 17
 isliye congress khulkar rajd kaa samarthan kar rahi he
 a JDU leader said that only after the presidential election will you know how close Lalu and the Congress get

 During Kejriwal's fast on the issue of electricity and water, the enthusiasm of his supporters is being seen

 He said that BJP is doing politics of corruption and we are doing politics against corruption
 congress se mili hui he bijepicageriwal ne bijepi ko bhi nishaanaa banaate huye kaha ki bijli or pani ke bill ke khilaaf bijepi kaa andolan sirf chunavi hatkandaa tha or vah congress se hi mili huyi he
 He said, 'people are being pressured to pay the bills because they are afraid of any legal action against themselves
 unhone kaha, ‘mere anshan kaa uddeshy avaidh bilon ke khilaaf zyada se zyada logon ko jodna he
 'kejriwal appealed to the people not to pay the bills
 unhone kaha ki agar zyada se zyada log bilon kaa bhugtan nahin kar ‘naagarik avagya’ andolan main hissaa lenge to sarkaar or bijli companiyaan unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar paayengi
 Kejriwal is demanding reduction in electricity rates in Delhi but he will not get support of Anna Hazare in this fast
 aam aadmi party ko mili manyatavaheen duusari ore chunaav ayog ne aam aadmi party ko manyata de di he
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which is preparing for the Delhi Assembly elections, has decided to make the problems of the common man a weapon against the government, sparking the anger of the party, party leader Arvind Kejriwal started an indefinite fast against the increased bills of electricity and water
 are doing
 23 march yani bhagat singh ke shahadat diwas par shuru ho rahe is andolan kaa pehla charan sundarangari main upwas se hoga
 Kejriwal demands that the prices of electricity and water be reduced in Delhi
 unhone dilli kii janata se apil kii he ki yaa to wo bijli or pani kaa bill na bhare, or agar bharen bhi to sirf aadha, kejariwal ne shila dikshit sarkaar par bijli companiyon se mileebhagat kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Actually, the effort of the Aam Aadmi Party is to prove itself a genuine advocate of the rights of the people of Delhi
 andolan main sarkaar se koi maang nahin kii jaaegi balki koshish logon ko dilli sarkaar ke khilaaf or aam aadmi party ke saath khadaa karne kii he
 On the other hand, the Congress and the BJP are upset with Kejriwal's bet but do not want to give attention
 dilli main ho rahi ceiling bhale hi supreme court dwaara gathit cameti ke nirdesh par ho rahi he, lekin iske liye agar kisi kii sabase zyada aalochana ho rahi he to wo he emsidi
 To avoid this, now the South MCD has taken a big step and instructed the officials not to seal without notice
 buudhvaar ko southamasidisthayee samiti kii baithak ke dauraan ceiling kaa mudda chaaya rahaa
 The Congress and BJP opposed the ceiling in unison on the problems faced by the traders with sealing
 congress dal ke netaa abhishek dutt ne south emsidi standing cameti main kaha kii "ceiling karne vaale adhikari khud kanphyus hai ki wo diemasi act ke mutabik karrwai karen yaa monitering cameti ke mutabik"
 Abhishek Dutt made a big charge, saying that "the Monitoring Committee is doing Hitlership"
 is baat kaa bijepi parshad or sthaayee samiti sadsy shikha raay ne samarthan kiya, lekin iske liye congress ko zimmedaar bataate hue kaha ki ceiling kaa mudda shila dikshit kii sarkaar ke vaqt kyon nahin suljhaayaa gaya
 On this, Congress councilor Abhishek Dutt hit back saying that the MCD has been with the BJP government for 15 years, so what has it done so far? After this, Standing Committee Chairman Bhupendra Gupta said that it is written in the DMC Act that it is necessary to give at least 48 hours notice before sealing, in that case we will ask our officials to give notice before sealing
 bhupendra gupta ne kaha ki south emsidi ke sarvadaleey parshad kendriya mantri hardip singh puri se jaakar milenge or apil karenge ki kam se kam 30 june 2018 tak ceiling naa ho or logon ko canvarjan charge jamaa karaane kaa mauka mili
 d-seelabhupendra Gupta, a farm house in Chhatarpur, said that a few days ago the Ramaya farmhouse was sealed in Chhatarpur area on the instructions of the Monitoring Committee, it has been temporarily decolored as there was already booking of weddings
 isi ko aadhaar banaate hue sthaayee samiti ne nirdesh die hai ki jin vyapaariyon ke paas sabhi kaagazat hai, zone ke disi unki madad karen or monitering cameti se milakar unki dukaanon ko disil kare kyonki sil kii gai kai aisi sampattiyaan bhi he jinke andar ro material he yaa aisa saamaan he jo kharaab ho saktaa he aise main unki dukaanon ko sthai taur par disil kiya ja sake or unka kam se kam nuksaan naa ho
 If we had to go on strike, how much pressure the MCD has on the ceiling in Bhupendra Guptadilli can be gauged from the fact that the standing committee chairman Bhupendra Gupta talked about this issue even before letting the dharna sit on the monitoring committee's office
 
 haalanki baad main unhone kaha ki is masale par pehle wo party main aalaa netaaon se baat karenge

 kalpana chawla kaa safar The central government enacted the Lokpal law, but Arvind Kejriwal and his party do not agree with this law
 dilli main aam aadmi party ne apni sarkaar banate hi 15 dinon ke bheetar ramlila maidan main rajdhani kaa apana jan lokapal kanoon paas karne kii baat kahi he, lekin kya aisa karnaa sambhav he
 Experts say no
 vah bataate hai ki dilli main lokayukta kanoon ko vidhansabha main le jane se pehle centre kii sahmati chahie isliye arvind kejariwal kaa apane vaayade par khara utarana naammumkin he
 Will Arvind Kejriwal, who opposes Anna's Lokpal, be able to pass the Lokpal according to his mind even after becoming the CM of Delhi? Will the assembly session in Ramlila Maidan be called to pass this bill within 15 days of taking oath in the elections? According to experts, the answer to all these questions is in 'no'
 vajah ye ki dilli ek purna rajya he hi nahin
 Former Delhi Assembly Secretary SK Sharma said, "neither a meeting can be held at Ramlila Maidan nor Lokpal Bill can be introduced in the Assembly in Delhi without the approval of the Center
" darasal kejariwal ke daawey main dam isliye kam lagata he, kyonki dilli baaki rajyon kii tarah apana lokayukta bill banane ke liye swatantra nahin he
 The law still applies in Delhi like Union Territory, so after the Lokayukta's law is prepared, it will be necessary to first send it to the Union Home Ministry for approval through the office of the Lt
 Governor
 grih mantralay, kanoon mantralay or baaki sambandhit mantralayon se mashvira karne ke baad lokayukta bill jaruri sanshodhano ke saath waapas uparajyapal ke jariye dilli sarkaar ko bhejegi, jiske baad hi use vidhansabha kii manjuuri ke liye laayaa jayega
 This whole process may take several months, so even though Kejriwal may be making claims, it is not so easy
 pehle bhi aam aadmi party ke kai daavon ko sawaalon ke ghere main rakhaa ja chukaa he
 In such a situation, that will be the first fire test for the Lokayukta law party, which has topped his list so far

 But both did not listen

 AAP leader Kapil Mishra, who accused Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal of taking a bribe of two crore rupees from his minister Satyendar Jain, is now surrounded by questions himself
 sawaal bada sawaal pichley do din main unke dwaara die gaye bayanon ke virodhabhas se uth rahaa he
 The truth of Mishra's allegations will be revealed only after investigation, but the way he is isolated in the Aam Aadmi Party on this issue, his bets are more likely to be reversed
 darasal kal mantripad se hataae jane ke baad kapil mishra ne twit kiya tha ki wo tanker ghotaale ko lekar kal yani ravivaar ko bada khulaasa karenge lekin ravivaar ko jab ve media ke saamne aae to unhone tanker ghotaale kaa naam hi nahin liya balki wo sidhe-sidhe kejariwal par apane mantri satyendra jain se do karod rupee ghoose lene kaa aarope laga gaye
 Just yesterday, Kapil Mishra tweeted that he had met Arvind Kejriwal and informed the Chief Minister about the corruption going on inside the party and on Sunday he will keep this information in front of the public
 lekin ravivaar ko to kapil ne kejariwal par hi karpshan ke aarope lagaae aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya kapil mishra ye kehane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki unhone kejariwal se milakar unhen visphotak jaankaree di ki mukhyamantri ne do karod rupee satyendra jain se liye?ye paanch sawaal to kapil mishra se bhi poochna jaruri he? clic kar padhein-kal kapil mishra ne khud twit kiya tha ki unhone din main kejariwal ko bhrashtachar se sambandhit mahatvapurn tathy die jinka khulaasa kal hoga
 The question is, what are those important facts? The Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders are highlighting Kapil's mistake in defending Kejriwal
 ajtak se baatcheet main aap netaa ashutosh ne bhi kapil mishra ke aaropon ke isi virodhabhas ko uthaaya
 Did Kapil change strategy at the last minute? Kapil made a sensational accusation of bribe of two crores on Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain, but questions are arising as to why he did not disclose the tanker scam? Even the allegations made by Kapil Mishra will be difficult for him to prove
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki unhone jis samay ye do karod rupee dekhe usee samay kyon nahin iskar vibhaag yaa duusari agenciyon ko phone kar kejariwal ko range haath pakadava diya? jis samay ye kathith len-dein ho rahaa tha kya us samay vahaan koi chauthaa vyakti bhi maujuud tha, jo isaki tasdik kar sake?kapil mishra se jab poocha gaya ki unhone kaise pataa kiya ki ye rakam do karod kii he to unhone kaha ki khud satyendra jain ne unhen bataaya yani jain ne unhen rakam kitni he ye to bataa diya lekin ye nahin bataaya ki ye kahaan se ai or kis kaam ke liye di gai
 Questions are also arising whether he was talking about what Kapil Mishra had revealed in the media for the last two days or did he change his strategy at the last minute? gharelu share bazaaron main teji par kaarobaar band hua

 apane udyogon ko shakti dene ke liye big data or eani se las hone ke maamle main koi bhi desh isse tej nahin bad rahaa
 Most experts believe that this is going to be the next technological wave
 pichley saal sitambar main beijing ne shiksha se lekar parivahan tak vibhinn halkon main eani takanic kaa istemaal karne kii yojana taiyaar kii thi
 China is focusing exclusively on AI technology
 ab nayaa ''maid in china"bharat main aam taur par logon ke liye ''maid inchina" kaa matlab nakli saamaan, saste khilaunon or parale darje ke electric upkarnon se hota he
 But the truth is completely different
 masalan jiyaan kii ek factory main inasaanon kii jagah roboton ne le lee he, jahaan duniya ke sabase unnat lager diod banaae ja rahe hai
 China is building the world's largest big data center in Guizhou
 beijing ke takneekee centre jhonguankun main starop se shuruyaat karne vaali internet companiyaan ab duniya kii vishalkay companiyon main shumaar ho chuki hai
 Four of the world's ten largest Internet companies in terms of earnings are from China — e-commerce giant JD and Alibaba, Tencent, which is associated with the social media app "wechat", and Baidu, which debuted as a search engine Thi and is now moving ahead in the field of AI and includes special types of cars
 duniya kii 25 badi companiyon main bharat kii keval ek flipcart aati he
 China has more than 700 million Internet users — twice as much as India
 china takneekee kshetra main teji se america kii barabari kii disha main bad rahaa he or donon ke bich kaa antar lagaataar kam hota ja rahaa he
 Particularly cautious of China's rising footprint in the field of AI, the Barack Obama administration had formulated a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan which found that the trend of AI research is "growing in the world and America is now in terms of publication numbers" Is no longer ahead
 "vah sthaan ab china le chukaa he
 That plan stated that the impact of AI on society "will continue to increase in many areas, including employment, education, public safety, and national security, which will also have an impact on America's economic growth
" "alibaba ke purv adhyaksh tu jaipei kehete hai, ''china or america ke bich antar ghatata ja rahaa he
 China has a good chance to become a leader in the field of AI

 wechat's generation is the two largest digital initiatives in China by Alibaba and Tencent's wechat
 vichet ke ek arab se zyada yujar hai
 Alibaba has transformed the business and wechat is the most unique social media platform in the world
 ise galat rup se paribhaashit karte hue china kaa whatsap kaha jaataa he
 Actually, it is more modern than whatsapp
 isane whatsap se saal bhar pehle hi aawaaj or video kaa istemaal shuru kar diya tha
 In a way, it is somewhat like a mix of whatsapp, Facebook and Paytm — users can post photographs, messages and use it as an e-wallet
 is samvaadadaata ne paaya ki aap bas ungliyaan pher kar jeb main ek paisa bhi nakadi rakhe bina beijing main film kaa tikat kharidne or taxi kaa order dene se lekar bijli or gas kaa bill chukaa sakate hai
 "wechat produces 100 million photos every day," says Tu

 And thus it can take the form of an AI company
 "eani daudbeijing main eani kaa istemaal karne vaali badi companiyon main ''yuisi" sabase aage he
 It is developing autonomous cars
 iske sah-sansthaapak or siio vu gansha kehete hai, ''ham samaaj ko puri tarah se badalane ke liye eani or big data kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai
 From traffic jams to accidents, from air pollution to the design of cities, Autonomous cars can do a lot to overcome society's problems

 "wu is working with the government to make Hongzhou's experiment nationwide and believes that China is now moving faster than the US
 ve kehete hai, ''main udyog or ity mantralay ke saath kai baar baatcheet main shaamil rahaa hum
 He believes that Autonomous cars are an integral part of smart cities
 china ne 2020 tak 1,000 nae shahar banane kii yojana banaai he
 In this way we will have 1,000 new cities that will be compatible with Autonomous cars
 "cafu lee, jo pehle google china ke pramukh rah chuke hai or ab eani-kendrit nivesh form ke pramukh hai, kehete hai ki china kii eani industry ''vishwa kii agua" he

 "lee kehete hai, agar pehali lahar internet thi to duusari lahar he eani ko kaarobaar main istemaal karnaa jisane data kaa digitikaran kar diya he
 China is using it in all sectors from banking to healthcare and transportation as part of its AI policy
 ve kehete hai, teesri lahar ab robotics or autonamas vaahanon kii he jahaan china apana dabadabaa bana rahaa he
 China's new employee robots have replaced employees in the assembly line at a company in Xian
 yah pracheen shahar apane terracotta yoddhaon ke liye mashhoor rahaa he
 The 10-year-old company manufactures advanced laser products that are used in the space sector, from information technology and life sciences
 menuphaccharing main china kii safalataa eani or anya kshetron main isaki pragati ko sahaara de rahi he
 a revolution is coming in smart manufacturing under the "made in China 2025" scheme
 is yojana par amal karte hue china ne focuslite ke sansthaapak victor liyu se sampark kiya jo 2006 main silicon vaili chhodie ke baad swadesh lautne se hichak rahe the
 By that time China had gone far ahead in manufacturing but was far behind the West in terms of new experiments
 liyu sarkaar ke us kaarykram ke pehle batch kaa hissaa the jiske tahat bharat kii tarah hi kuch pratibhaaon ko waapas apane desh laane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa tha
 With the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liu launched focuslight that manufactured advanced laser diodes, and in less than five years she was competing with American and European giants
 dekhte hi dekhte yah company apane kshetra main duniya kii teesri sabase unnat company ban gai
 "people don't know that manufacturing is the key to new experiments," says Liu
 isse neufaccharing se aapako nae idia milte hai ki kisi utpaada ko kaise dizin kiya jaae or use kaise taiyaar kiya jaae

 Strict surveillance: China's efforts to become a digital nation is seen by the one-party power as a decisive weapon to maintain its social dominance
 pichley saal november main china main ek video viral hua
 It showed that the government was using facial recognition technology prepared by the Chinese company to identify every person passing through the busiest traffic intersection with his ID number
 jis sensophes naamak company kii takanic kaa prayog kiya gaya, uske siio ke mutabik beijing, chongkwing, guangdong, sichuaan or hanaan main iskaa prayog kiya ja rahaa he or isane ek hi shahar se 40 dinon ke andar 69 aparaadhiyon / sandigdhon ko khoj nikaala
 Skynet is a nationwide system with millions of cameras equipped with AI features to keep a close watch on traffic violators and criminals
 ye camere galiyon main lagaae gaye hai
 Although the government says that this will stop crime but it also disrupts the privacy of the people
 bharat ke liye sabakabharat main yah aam dharna he ki china to nakli or saste saamaan banane kaa maharathi he
 Assessing China's progress from this perspective, the tendency to reject it can prove dangerous
 2016 tak china kii diggaj internet company bidu ke saath jude rahe kaisar kuo kehete hai, ''main nahin samajhataa ki kisi ne 15 saal pehle yah sochaa bhi hoga ki internet kii 10 sabase badi companiyon main se chaar china kii hongi
 "according to Kuo, there is a misconception among people that China is the only country that stops the challenge of foreign companies for their companies

 Regarding the safety of women, the opinion of most of the speakers was that North India or South women are not safe anywhere and discrimination against women is everywhere
 mahila suraksha or bhedbhaavlila samsundakshin bharat main khule dimag ke log hai
 But nowhere, no girl is completely safe

 Khushbooratan certainly has male prominence in politics, but women should be encouraged to enter this field
 lekin mahilaon ke liye raajnneeti aasaan nahin hota, isamen kaaphi samay dena padataa he, mahilaon ko parivaar kaa saport nahin miltaa

 Nitish also wants Tejashwi to clarify his position
 isi ko lekar jediu or argedy main thani hui he
 Even after Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi's meeting last week, no solution could be found for this

 The poster says that Tejashwi has given clarification after meeting Nitish
 iske baad bhi jediu pravaktaa anaap-shanaap bayaan de rahe hai
 It has been claimed that Nitish has denied rhetoric but still rhetoric is being done about Tejashwi
 is baar nitish kumaar ko hinsa kii ummid thi, lekin aurangabad ke sthaneey saansad ke saamne logon ke dukaan ko jaise aag lagaai gai
 As such, the real danger to Nitish is more from the opposition than BJP like ally who no longer abstains from violence under the guise of religion for votes
 agar bihar police kii maane to pradarshnakariyon ko hangaamaa or todphod karne se rokane ke bajaay unke khilaaf maamle darj karne par dhyaan dena behatar hoga

 bihar cader ke 1977 batch ke ipies adhikari abhayanand ne pichley saal sitambar main police pramukh kaa jimmaa sambhala
 He said in the meeting that during the killing of Brahmeshwar Singh in June, he ordered his men to do videography instead of taking action against the protesters
 yah sunakar vigyaan bhawan ke sabhaagaar main maujuud log hatprabh rah gaye or anand se unke faisle ko lekar sawaal karne lage
 The general opinion was that the first action of the police was to prevent destruction of property
 bihar police mahanideshak ke jawaab ne logon ko or chaunkaa diya
 He said that whatever was destroyed was government property
 
 
 kuch vaahan or kuch imaaraten
 Asked the response, Anand said, 'I do not believe that i should say anything because it is a professional matter and i would not like to debate it on the media platform
 ’bihar ke dijipi ne yah bhi kaha ki unhen apane faisle par pachhtaawaa nahin hua
 However, there was tension in some areas including the capital Patna
 unhone bataaya ki videography ke baad police ne pradarshnakariyon ke khilaaf maamle darj kiye
 However the people present there did not seem satisfied with this
 anand kaa bhaashan khatm hone ke baad kendriya ardhsainik bal ke ek varisht adhikari uthe or ummid jataai ki naksalwad ke khilaaf ladaai ke liye siarpief main tainaat bihar police is vichaar par amal nahin karegi
 After the officer said so much, the whole auditorium shouted loudly

 Whenever the Home Minister walks from place to place, the NSG Black Cat Commando briefcase carries a bulletproof shield
 jisamen agar koi achaanak hamalaa karne kii koshish karata he, to usko enesji ke commando twarit gati se roak sakate hai
 What is a Briefcase Ballistic Shield? a briefcase ballistic shield is a portable bullet proof shield that acts as a shield when the briefcase is opened
 yah ativishisht (VVIP) vyaktiyon ko tatkaal suraksha detii he
 Basically it is a portable bullet proof shield or portable fold out ballistic shield, which can be opened during an attack

 After a long political drama in Karnataka, it was finally decided on Saturday evening that the real King of the state H
K
 di kumaraswami honge
 Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa could not bring Congress, JDS or other mlas into his ranks to prove majority on the floor of the House and announced his resignation with a passionate speech
 baavjood iske congress or jedies ne apane vidhayakon ko aaazaad rahane kii anumati nahin di he
 Yeddyurappa's resignation is being attributed to the victory of democracy and the strong strategy of congress-jds
 darasal, chunaav nattejey ghoshit hone ke pashchaat hi congress-jedies ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane vidhayakon ko bachaane kii thi
 The BJP won 104 seats, so Yeddyurappa needed the support of 7 more mlas to form and save the government
 kyonki chunaav main congress-jedies ke alaava sirf ek nirdaleey or do anya vidhayak chunakar aae, aise main bijepi ke paas congress-jedies vidhayakon main send lagane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 This is the reason that only after the results came, the Congress and JDS gathered and hid their respective mlas
 shanivaar ko yediurppa sarkaar ke floor test se pehle in vidhayakon ko vidhansabha laayaa gaya
 Still not 'azad', even after the fall of the BJP government, these mlas have not been sent home
 angreji akhbaar da hindu kii khabar ke mutabik, donon party ke vidhayakon ko abhi bhi aaraam nahin diya gaya he
 Although they have now been evicted from the resort, these legislators have been kept in two private hotels in Bengaluru after the situation on the jds-congress alliance government cleared on Saturday
 akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki congress or jedies abhi bhi bijepi se chaukanni he
 Actually, after the BJP government fell, HD Kumaraswamy has got a chance to form the government, but he too has to prove his majority before the House
 rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne shanivaar shaam echdi kumaraswami ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya or 15 din ke andar bahumat sabit karne kaa vakt diya
 Kumaraswamy will take oath on May 23 after the Governor's invitation
 iske baad unhen sadan main bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 In such a situation, despite defeating the BJP, the Congress and the JDS are stepping up and they do not want to take any kind of threat until the majority is proved
 sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko daawa kiya kiati vishisht vyaktiyon kii surakshaun par khatre ke jokhim ke aadhaar par kam kii ja sakati he lekin kisi ko anaavashyak suraksha nahin di gayi he
 Union Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said that the security wing of the police assesses who needs protection and who does not and it is a continuous process based on the risk of danger
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘yadi kahin aavashyaktaa se adhik suraksha he to use kam karne kii jarurat he
 i can say that if there is excessive security, it should be reviewed and mitigated
 lekin koi anaavashyak suraksha nahin he
 However, he also cautioned that whenever a person's safety shield is removed, there are fatal assaults on him
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki jin pulicekarmiyon ko ativishisht vyaktiyon kii suraksha kii duty par lagaaya jaataa he unhen mahilaon ke liye sadak surakshit banane jaise uddeshyon ke liye tainaat kiya ja saktaa he
 a bench headed by Justice GS Singhvi has questioned the issue of police safety to a large number of vips
 peeth ne kaha ki yadi vibhinn adaalaton ke nyaayadhishon ko die gaye surakshakarmi vahaan se hataakar sadakon par tainaat kiye jaaen to unhen koi dikkat nahin hogi

 katni se transfar kiye gaye IPS gaurav tiwari ne apane nae jile main jate hi bhrashtachar ko lekar apana sakht rukh dikhaa diya he
 His latest order has given sleep to the police station in-charge of Chhindwara district
 darasal abhi tak rishwat lene par sambandhit pulicekarmi yaa adhikari par hi karrwai hoti thi, lekin IPS gaurav tiwari ne ab zile ke sabhi thana prabhariyon ko aadesh jari karte hue kaha he ki agar unke thane kaa koi bhi staff rishwat lete paaya jaataa he to uske saath-saath sambandhit thana prabharee ko bhi nilambit kar diya jayega
 In an order issued on 21 January, SP Gaurav Tiwari wrote, "all the station in-charge Chhindwara is informed that the staff and any officer or employee of the post is trapped by the Lokayukta, assuming the involvement of the in-charge of the station concerned
 Strict punitive action will be taken immediately by suspending the concerned station in-charge
 'katni main bhi bhrashtachar par ksaa tha shikanjipies gaurav tiwari jabakatnispi the, tab unhen vahaan 500 karod rupye ke hawala kaarobaar ko ujagar karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Recently, when he was transferred to Chhindwara from Katni, the entire city of Katni had come on the streets and demanded the government to make Tiwari back as Katni SP
 lagbhag ek hafte tak katni shahar mendhifsh tiwari ke samarthan main pradarshanhue the
 Later, political parties too had raised the issue and showered accusations on the government
 sarkaar puraane noton ke exange par puri tarah roak lagane par vichaar nahin kar rahi he
 The clarification came from the government officials when some government sources said on Friday that the government feels that the proposal to exchange notes can be misused and it can create 'disruptions in the banking system'
 sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya he ki 'aisa koi kadam nahin uthaaya jayega jisase janata ke bich khalabali much jaae
 Comments bataa den ki jab se notebandi kaa faisla liya gaya he uske baad se kuch sambandhit khabaron main dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah 500 or 1000 rupee ke note badalane ke liye ek hi vyakti baar baar aa rahaa he
 Because of this, those who are needy are not getting money
 paanch sau or hazaar rupee ke noton par bain lagane ke baad sarkaar ne kaha tha ki in puraane noton ko saal ke ant tak bank main jamaa karvaa diya jaae
 It was then announced that for the present, old notes of up to four thousand rupees can be replaced with new notes of five hundred and two thousand rupees
 isi hafte is seemaa ko badhaakar 4500 rupee kar diya gaya tha jise guuruuvaar ko 2000 rupee kar diya gaya
 Officials of the Finance Ministry have admitted that evidence has been found that someone else is looking for someone to take new notes or that the same person is repeatedly in line
 zyaadaatar aarthik jaankaron ne sarkaar ke is faisle lene ke peeche kii niyat kaa samarthan kiya he lekin saath hi yah bhi mana he ki zyaadaatar halaat yah dikhaa rahe hai ki sarkaar is faisle ke kriyanvayan ko lekar taiyaar nahin thi or use andaaza nahin tha ki logon ko kis had tak pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Let us know that since the note ban has been taken, some related news has shown that the same person is coming again and again to change the 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 is vajah se jo jaruratmand hai unhen paisa nahin mil paa rahaa he
 After banning five hundred and thousand rupee notes, the government had said that these old notes should be deposited in the bank by the end of the year
 uske baad ghoshnaa kii gai ki philhal ke liye chaar hazaar rupee tak ke puraane noton ko paanch sau or 2 hazaar rupee ke nae noton se badla ja saktaa he
 This week this limit was increased to Rs 4500 which was increased to Rs 2000 on Thursday
 vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ne mana he ki iske saboot dekhne ko mili hai ki nae note lene ke liye kisi or ke liye koi or lag rahaa he yaa phir ek hi vyakti baar baar line main lag rahaa he
 Most economic experts have supported the intention of the government to take this decision, but at the same time, it is also believed that most of the circumstances are showing that the government was not ready to implement this decision and did not know that people To what extent can the problem be faced

 Mistry said at a conference organized by the Indian Chartered Accountant Institute (ICAI) that reducing demand pressure to combat high inflation increases the risk of a slowdown in the economy, which has a negative impact on job creation
 unhone kaha, 'nae pratibhashali yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene ke liye hamen har saal 80 lakh nae rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karne kii jarurat he

 Discomfort because the post-independence era had taken off
 aradhana jaisi super hit film se rajesh khanna kaa aavirbhaav hua tha
 Khanna's romance took people away from the stony world, after the rain on the screen, people saw two young hearts in the deserted house burning fire and then doing everything that was only in their dreams
 rajesh khanna apane 4 saal ke chote superstaradam main logon ko lubhaa to le gaye, lekin samaaj parade par parikthaon jaisi prem kahaniyon ko dekhakar kar kasmasaa rahaa tha
 This type of escapism would not be sustainable
 so, taash ke is mahal ko bas ek phoonk kii darkaar thi
 The audience was restless
 unheen dinon parade par romance kii naakaam koshishon ke baad ek baagi tevar kii dhamak dikhi, jise logon ne amitabh bachchan ke naam se janaa
 a loud voice was needed to fight inflation, unemployment, corruption and a crippling system
 aise main is lambey ladke kii buland awaz parade par gunjane lag gai
 This young man had so much power that he could take iron out of the system himself and the self-helpman did not even bear the money thrown
 gussell nigahon ko baichaiyn haav-bhav or sanjeeda-vidrohi awaz ne nai dehbhasha di
 At a time when the country was crumbling under the nexus of hoarding, black marketing and contractors-money lenders, Bachchan made the youth's anger on screen through films like Zanjeer and Dwar
 vijay ke naam se janaa jane vaala yah shaks, ek aisa noujvaan tha, jo insaaf ke liye lard rahaa tha, or jisko nyaay nahin mili to vah akelaa maidan main kud padataa he
 Some people even go so far as to say that this angry young man played by Amitabh stopped the path of a big revolution in the seventies
 lekin badalte vakt ke saath is noujvaan ke charitra main bhi badlaav aayaa
 The youngster, who quit the job of sub-inspector for the principles in Zanjeer, becomes middle aged by film dev
 zanjeer main us sab-inspector ko jo dost miltaa he vah bhi gazab kaa
 For him, Yari is like faith
 baharhaal, amitabh kaa gussa bhi kuli, inkulab aate-aate tiped ho gaya
 Whenever Amitabh tried to change himself or his voice in someone i am free or in Agneepath, people did not accept
 to naepan ke is abhaav kii vajah se laal badshaah, matyudaata, or koharaam kaa puraane billon or unheen totakon ke saath waapas aayaa hua amitabh logon ko nahin bhaayaa
 Reason- During the period of liberalization the mind of the Indian public had changed
 ab logo ke paas kharch karne ke liye paisa tha, to vah roti ke masale par kyon gussa jaahir kare
 The change in age has also become the reason for change in principles
 dev main isi noujvaan ke police kamishnar banate hi usul badal jate hai, or vah samjhautavaadi ho jaataa he
 But for an actor like Amitabh, it does not look like two separate photographs in Indian society
 donon ek duusare main itani ghulmil gaye hai ki abhinayta or vyakti amitabh ek se hi dikhte hai
 When actor Amitabh goes through something, people remember Amitabh of real life and when Amitabh does something real, his character on the screen is seen
 amitabh kaa charitra bazaar ke saath jis tarah badla he vah bhi apane aapmen ek chaunkaane vaala parivartan he
 When a child on the wall said that the money given to him by throwing away was not acceptable, the money should be given to him, then the people played applause
 bahut se logon ko laga ki yahi to atmasamman ke saath jeena he
 Then the same Amitabh threw money in front of the people and said, 'take, let's be a millionaire
 ’ kuch logon ko yah amitabh akhar rahaa tha lekin zyaadaatar logon ko bazaar kaa khadaa kiya hua yah amitabh bhi bha gaya
 With his films, Amitabh is selling every possible thing today
 vah tel, agarbatti, polio drop se lekar rang-rogan, beemaa or cola tak kharidne kaa aagrah darshakon se karte hai
 Why not, he has an image and he has every right to redeem his image
 darshak kisi bujurg kii baat kii tarah unki baat aadhi sunata bhi he or aadhi bisraa bhi detaa he
 However, in the advertisements that Amitabh Bachchan did with his films, his standing with the market and with the trend is clear
 vigyaapan main kanghee-sheesha-tel bechney ke saath-saath amitabh ne apni siyaasi dosti bhi nibhaai
 On the one hand, he became the brand ambassador of polio under commitment and compulsion, while on the other hand he also made Uttar Pradesh the best state
 (kaam kiya yah takiyakalam he samaajwaadiyon kaa) or phir badalte vakt ke saath amitabh ne jaahir na hone dete hue paala badal liya
 Now they request the audience to spend some days in Gujarat
 baharhaal, amitabh bachchan kii sabase buree filmon main kisi ko amitabh ke abhinay se shikaayat nahin hui he
 Storm, Magician to Aks, Nishabd, Three
 
 Name any film, Amitabh is restrictive about work time and work
 unke in gunon ko lekar tanon kaagaj kharch kiye ja chuke hai
 Filhaal, looking at his stature and acting, this is what we say that the emperor of the industry had to get it
 na miltaa, to dada sahib phalke puraskaar hi arthhin hota
 *** oriental bank of commers, raipur menvakencinikali he

 rajnatik hukmran sabase zyada taqatvar hote hai or aksar bade hi nirlajj tareeke se aviveki bhi ho jate hai
 Kuldeep Narayan, a 34-year-old commissioner of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), has got to learn this lesson very bitterly
 jithan ram maanjhi kii sarkaar ne 12 disambar ko 2005 batch ke is iees adhikari ke nilamban ke aadesh jari kar die jabaki patna hycourt ne pichley saal july main shahar main avaidh nirmaanon se jude maamalon ke antim nibatare tak narayan ke tabadale par roak laga di thi
 Narayan's suspension is being seen as an indirect way for the government to get rid of him because the government could not remove him directly through transfers because of the stay
 lekin jab narayan ke nilamban ke mudde ko patna hycourt ke saamne uthaaya gaya to nyaayamurti ve
 N
 sinha or nyaayamurti pi
 K
 jha kii khandpeeth ne 15 disambar ko nilamban par bhi roak laga di
 The court said that both the suspension and the transfer is intended to remove the officer, who has already been banned by the court
 donon nyaayadhishon ne narayan ke nilamban ko 'badaniyatapurna' bataaya
 The bench is hearing a public interest litigation against high-rise buildings spreading like mushrooms in the capital
 shahari vikaas or awaasan vibhaag ne narayan ke nilamban kii sifarish karte hue un par ye aarope lagaae hai—patna solid west management project ko lagu na karnaa, aparyaapt foging karnaa jiske chalate dengue failaa, fund kaa istemaal na karnaa or piemasi main raajnneeti failaana
 The General Administration Department issued the suspension order of Narayan after the approval of the Chief Minister
 is nilamban aadesh ke chalate kai logon kii peshaani par bal pade kyonki jithan ram maanjhi or unase pehle nitish kumaar kii jedy (you) sarkaron ne ateet main gambhir galtiyaan karne vaale adhikariyon ke prati bhi aksar kaaphi narmi dikhaai he
 The Manjhi government had transferred only a few officers even after the 33 people killed in the Patna stampede in October this year and they too got new appointments soon
not a single officer was suspended despite the pramukh grih sachiv amir subhaani ke netritv vaali ucchstareey jaanch kamity kii ore se bhagdad ke liye jimmedaar gambhir prashasnic khaamiyon ko khaas taur par ingit kiye jane ke baavjood ek bhi adhikari ko nilambit nahin kiya gaya tha
 In November 2012, no action was taken against bureaucrats even after the death of 19 people in a similar stampede in Patna on the occasion of Chhath festival
 july 2013 main saaran main mid-de mile main kitnashakayukt jaharila bhojan khaane se 23 maasoom bacchon kii maut kii ghatana ke baad bhi sarkaar ne na to jila magistrate or na hi sambhddha vibhaagon ke varisht adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kiya
 Even after the Bodh Gaya blasts in July 2013 and the Patna blasts in October 2013, the state government remained lenient towards the bureaucrats, so its order to suspend Narayan has been stunned for a number of serious reasons
 mote taur par yahi samaj ja rahaa he ki rajya vidhansabha chunaavon se mahaj 10 maah pehle nilamban kaa yah aadesh building mafia ke dabaav main diya gaya he
 Considered an honest officer, Narayan was consistently active against the mighty builders' lobby in Patna
 ateet main unke adeshon se jad (you) ke vivaadaaspad or bahubali vidhayak anant singh samet kai taqatvar shakhsiyaton par pratikul asar padaa tha
 The state government, considered soft on the builders, was unhappy with this official because of their tough measures against the builders
 isse pehle shahari vikaas or awaasan vibhaag ne sarkaar ko yah suzav diya tha ki chunki piemasi apni jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah bhalee-bhaanti nahin kar rahaa he, isliye is nikaay ko bhang karke kamishnar ko nilamban par rakh diya jaae
 Although there is no official connection, some political analysts allege that Samrat Chaudhary, the minister of urban development and housing department of the state, had to pay the old account to Narayan
 haalanki samraat ne narayan ke nilamban ke peeche yah kaaran hone se saaf inkaar kiya he lekin yah to hakeekat he hi ki narayan ne november, 2012 main munger ke jiladhikari ke rup main netaa shakuni choudhary kii ore se avaidh tareeke se bechi gai 1
 Settlement of 40 acres of land was rejected
 purv mantri shakuni ko yah jameen purv-sanyakarmi ke taur par aavantit kii gai thi
 Samrat Chaudhary, Minister of Urban Development and Housing, who played the main role in Narayan's suspension order, is the son of the same Shakuni Chaudhary
 rajya sarkaar ne isse pehle bhi narayan ko piemasi se hataane ke liye kai tareeke aajamaae the
 The government filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on November 25 last year to dismiss the Patna High Court order of July 2, 2013 prohibiting the transfer of Narayan
 supreme court ne isamen hastkshep karne se inkaar karte hue sarkaar ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah usee court ke paas darkhwaast de jisane tabadale ke sambandh main nirdesh die the
 In July 2014, Narayan called Anant Singh's wife Neelam Singh's proprietary Hotel Buddha Inn illegal, and recommended its power be cut
 narayan ne yah aadesh tab jari kiya jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki jad (you) vidhayak kii patni ke naam lij kaa avaidh rup se hastantaran karke hotel kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 The hotel was built without the approval of any registration, NOC or building plan from the PMC
 phir awasaiya uddeshy ke liye lij par di gai kisi sampatti kaa istemaal hotel sareekhe vanijyik upkram ke nirmaan ke liye karnaa niyamon ke saaf khilaaf tha
 Narayan also ordered demolition of two floors of Patna Central Mall, another property of Anant Singh in Patna
 unhone building niyamon kaa ulanghan karke oonchi imaaraton kaa nirmaan karne ke aaropon main 450 bilderon or bhu-swaamiyon ke khilaaf bhi visilence kii jaanch shuru kar di thi
 In june-july 2013, Narayan issued a notice to 1,241 buildings as a PMC Commissioner and banned the construction of 449 buildings which were suspected to have been violated by building bye-laws
 sitambar, 2013 main unhone 70 imaaraton ke khilaaf visilence ke maamle daakhil kiye the
 They have so far initiated action against 472 under-construction buildings
 piemasi ayukta ke court ne aise 150 maamalon main pehle hi aadesh jari kar die hai
 The builder lobby has often been alleging that in the last two years Rs 15,000–20,000 crore due to Narayan
 kii pariyojnaayen lataki padi hai
 Bihar BJP Legislature Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi blamed a senior JD (U) leader for Narayan's suspension
 sarkaar ke nilamban ke aadesh se pehle shahar ke meyar afjal imam ne bhi narayan kii tankhwaah rokane kii naakaam koshish kii thi
 The councilors of the PMC had filed a petition in the High Court to remove him and the minister Samrat Chaudhary tried to vandalize the PMC to molest him
 haalanki narayan ne beparwaah hokar taqatvar builder lobby ke khilaaf apana abhiyaan jari rakhaa tha
 Narayan has again taken up his job after the Patna High Court stayed the suspension
 lekin is maamle ne 17 disambar ko tab nayaa mode le liya jab kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish ikbaal ahamed ansaari ne isaki sunwaayee ke liye hycourt kii purna peeth ko nirdesh diya
 His instruction came at the request of the government's lawyer
 15 disambar ko hycourt kii ore se narayan ke nilamban par roak lagane ke baad sarkaar ke vakil or pradhan atirikt mahadhivaktaa lalit kishor ne samuchit nirdesh ke liye kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish ke saamne maamla rakhaa
 On the same day, the bench of Acting Chief Justice Justice Iqbal Ahmed Ansari and Justice Samarendra Pratap Singh barred themselves from saying anything on the issue of suspension
 baharhaal, is samay narayan piemasi kamishnar ke taur par kaayam hai or jaahir he ki building up-niyamon kaa ulanghan karne waalon ke liye yah buree khabar he
 In UP, a young man had to pay the price for making a video of TTE and policemen doing illegal recovery on a train
 aropiyon ne pehle uski jamkar pitayee kii jiske baad use chalati train se dhakka de diya
 The young man died in the accident

 kangana or rajkumaar raav kii film 'mental he kya' charchaa main bani hui he
 Kangana's film is attracting attention due to its weird posters
 movie ke posters or tital par mental health exparts ne kadi aapatti jataai thi
 The Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) on Thursday wrote a letter to the censor board, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the PMO and objected to the title of the film
 ab is maamle main kangana ranut ne apni pratikriya jaahir kii he

 Team India's first Test tour of West Indies will start in Antigua from today
 iske saath hi team india ko isisi ranking main apni jagah or ank bachaane kii jaddojahad main bhi jutana hoga
 Australia and number two India, who are at the top of the ICC Test rankings, have to win as many matches in the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka and West Indies respectively, if they want to avoid losing key points in the ICC team rankings
 westeindies chaar test maichon kii siries ke liye bharat kii mejabani kar rahaa he

 bharat aathven number par sthit westeindies se 44 ank aage he
 While Australia has a lead of 33 points over number seven Sri Lanka
 aisi sthiti main yadi bharat or australia siries jeetne main naakaam rahete hai to unhen ank ganvaane padenge
 Australia will also have to win the series 2–0
 India currently have 112 points and if they are to retain them, they will have to win the Test series 3–0 from the West Indies
 3-1 yaa 2-0 se jeet kii sthiti par bhi bharat ko do ank ganvaane padenge
 In such a situation, India will be left with 110 points
 duusari taraf yadi westeindies is siries ko 3-1 yaa 2-0 se jeet letaa he to uske 79 ank ho jaaenge or bharat ke keval 98 ank rah jaaenge
 Similarly, Australia will have to beat Sri Lanka by a margin of 2–0 or better to remain at 118 points at present
 iske ulat yadi srilanka 1-0 se bhi jeet darj kar letaa he to use saat ank milenge or uske 92 ank ho jaaenge jabaki steve smith kii team ke 111 ank hi rah jaaenge
 England and Pakistan are currently playing a four-test series and so there is a possibility of considerable change at the top places in the table
 cricketrs kii ranking main bhi hoga bada badlaavayasir ke aswin se saat ank adhik hai or unhen abhi england ke khilaaf teen match or khilne hai
 It will be interesting to see how the top war goes on between these two spinners

 After the announcement of election dates in Delhi, this question was getting more and more loud that after whom Bijpi is going to challenge Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi
 modi ke netritv main chunaav ladane kii baat to thik thi, lekin ye sawaal bana hua tha ki koun hoga bijepi kaa cheharaa? The news of new faces joining the BJP started from the morning and in a few hours the speculation of faces like Jaya Prada and Shazia Ilmi joining the BJP intensified and in a short time both these names were left behind and Kiran Bedi's The name came to the forefront
 bijepi daftar main pahunchate hi sambit paatra or shrikant sharma jaise netaaon ne thodaa intazaar kiijie or abhi kuch saafe nahin hai, jaisi baaten kahin
 
 
 After that there was a message on mobile that Amit Shah will press conference at four o'clock
 isse yah saafe ho gaya ki kiran bedi ab bijepi main entry lene ja rahi hai
 By 3 o'clock, at 11 Ashoka Road, the rumor increased
 press conference kii taiyaari shuru ho gai
 Shortly before 4 pm Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay appeared and Kiran Bedi's entry with Amit Shah took place within minutes
 saath main arun jetali, prabhaat jha, dow harshavardhan, vijay goyal bhi the
 First of all Amit Shah welcomed Kiran Bedi to BJP
 unhone kaha ki kiran bedi ke aane se taaqat milegi
 But in the midst of all this, Satish Upadhyay's face was worth seeing, sitting down in the corner, constantly looking down and trying to look comfortable, but for many leaders like Satish Upadhyay, Jagdish Mukhi, Vijay Goel, Prabhat Jha, this decision was as much There is no knowledge of all this
 lekin kiran bedi pradhanmantri se milakar ain thim or unki entry amit shah or arun jetali jaise kaddavar netaa karvaa rahe hai to party netritv kaa ishaara bhi saafe he ki virodh kii awaz bheetar hi dab jaae to behatar
 Kiran Bedi started with the fact that she came into politics only with the inspiration of Prime Minister Modi and PM is also behind her decision
 sandesh saafe he ki ab unke kilaaf virodh kii awaazen sunai nahin dengi jaisaa pichhali baar unke shaamil hone kii atakalon kii bich hi sunai dene lagi thim
 In the true sense, the BJP has now landed in the riot of Delhi
 kiran bedi ke rup main bijepi ne apana trump card khelaa he
 The biggest challenge of BJP is Arvind Kejriwal and he has always been talking about honesty, clean image and fight against corruption
 aise main kiran bedi eemaandaar bhi hai or unki chhavi bedaag bhi he to ab kaante kii takkar hai
 As for the CM candidate, BJP feels that it is better to maintain suspense and perhaps the same is true

 In the electoral politics, the coin of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going on today and only, perhaps the Aam Aadmi Party has an idea

 Now focus only on Delhi: The first slide was coming as soon as the Kejriwal website opened, it was written in it
 
 
 dilli boli, 'modi for piem, kejariwal for siem
 'though many people started raising this question on social media, the party lifted the slide in a hurry
 lekin tab tak soshal media par party kii khinchaai shuru ho chuki thi
 The question also arises because in the recently concluded assembly elections, BJP gave the slogan 'chalo Modi Saath'
 vahiin maharashtra main 'centre main narendra or maharashtra main devendra' naare kaa danka baja
 Both these slogans got tremendous support from the public
 aam aadmi party kii ek slide bhi isi ke ird-gird najar aata he
 However, to avoid controversy, the party had put a bigger picture of Kejriwal than Modi
 aam aadmi party ne apane is slide ke samarthan main ek artical bhi likhaa tha jise baad main usne hataa liya
 It was written in that article, 'the people of Delhi have decided
 ve ek majboot pradhanmantri chaahate the isliye narendra modi ji ko chunaa
 Now a strong Chief Minister is wanted so that issues like corruption, inflation, schools, transport and hospitals can be resolved
 ve ab arvind kejariwal ko mukhyamantri ke taur par chaahate hai
 The party had also put a video in the article to support its claims, which has also been removed
 us video main dilli kii janata ko mukhyamantri pad par raay dete dekha ja saktaa tha
 The party also put out this video in support of its claims
