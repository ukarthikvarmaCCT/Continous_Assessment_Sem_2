 Sudhindra Kulkarni, a former Bharatiya Janata Party leader, former assistant to LK Advani and arrested in the 'note for vote' case, said in a Delhi court on Saturday that he should be made a witness and not an accused in the case
 kulkarni ke vakil mahipal singh ne vishesh nyaayadhish sangeeta dhingra sahagal se kaha, "adaalat ko mujhe is maamle main gavaah bananaa chahie, na ki aaropee

 The lawyer said, "it was just a sting operation exposing corruption and its purpose was to highlight the bargain during the trust vote
" " vakil ne kulkarni kii ore se kaha, "maine apane sahyogiyon, bhaajapa ke saansadon or suhail hindustani ke sahyog se sirf july 2008 main tatkaaleen centre sarkaar dwaara vishwaas mat main jeet hasil karne ke liye kii gai saudebaaji ko ujagar karne kii koshish kii

 'aa gaya hero' ko lekar govinda ke naam likhaa gaya he ye khat
 If you want to feel bad about a dancing star, consider it
 lekin hamaari baat par ek baar gaur jarur karen
 
 
 Dear Govinda ji, there was absolutely no need for you to come again, the way you have come
 aapkaa naam aate hi hamaare jahan main wo 'hero' saamne aata he jiske saath ham hansate the or jiske rone par ham apni ankhen bhi nam kar lete the
 The Bombay High Court gave a big relief to Govinda, getting bail in advance, be it Vicky of your 1986 film Love 86 or Kumar Saxena of 'khudgarz'
 yaa phir ham, ankhen or izzatdaar kaa vijay hi kyon naa ho, hamanen aapke un sabhi kirdaaron ko darshak ke taur par jiya he
 Also, the film 'swarg' is considered as Krishna's brother
 hamane aapke naam se hi 'number-1 ' siries ke har ek kirdaar ko dekha or uske aane par aaj bhi manoranjan doguna ho jaataa he
 The character of Raja Babu is still roaming around while writing
 yahaan tak kii aapaki film partner, kil-dil or hapi anding bhi aapaki maujuudagi kii vajah se nikharati hui najar ai hai, par aakhir kyon 'aa gaya hero'? is film kii koi bhi jarurat nahin thi
 Govinda told Karan, Dangerous, Varun Dhawan is also tight as you have not been since today, since 1986 and you have been our same level hero
 aapaki film 'aa gaya hero' dekhakar hamen bilkul bhi khushi nahin hui or har ek pal main bas yahi sawaal ham khud se kar rahe the ki aakhir aapane 2017 main itane saare paise lagaakar, is film ko kyon kiya?har ek rielity sho chaahe wo big bos ho, dance sho ho, singing sho ho yaa phir kamedi sho, aapane film kaa prachaar har ek manch par kiya or yakeen maaniye wo promoshan bhi film se kai guna behatar the kyonki pramotion ke dauraan aap apane lag rahe the
 We would like to say one more thing that during the entire promotion, you kept your agony in front of the industry, from Karan Johar to David Dhawan and Varun Dhawan, which was not needed
 aaj sach main hamen kaaphi dukh hua
 Govinda opened 'hero Number 1' restaurant in Delhi
 We just want to say that you are an actor whose name brings a different kind of excitement and thrill and we believe that you connect with better stories on screen, Because a better story will become a blockbuster with your presence
 ranvir singh aaj bhi aapaki photo ko apni disple pikchar bana ke rakhe hue hai vahiin ham phens puure parivaar ke saath tivi se chipak jate hai jab aapaki filmein aati hai
 You connect with every film, work with every type of young or similar actors and wish the above people that our hero should be the same, it does not need to be called 'aa Gaya Hero' again and again
 ant main aapke hi andaaj main kahana chahenge 'swasth rahen, mast rahen, vyast rahen'

 To do something amazing, it is important that the team play in unison, because there are discussions of differences between the players and the coach

 america main pakistan ke purv rajdoot hossain hakkaani ne kaha he ki jab tak islamabad apni sarajameen se aatankwaadi thikaanon ko nahin hataata tab tak baatcheet nirarthak rahegi
 Haqqani supported India's stand on terrorism and talks cannot go hand-in-hand, saying that any high-level dialogue between the two countries would be meaningless until Islamabad removes terrorist bases from its territory
 hakkaani ne kaha ki pakistan kii bharat ke saath vaarta kii haalia pahal ko us par pad rahe aarthik evam antarrashtriya dabaav ke pariprekshya main dekha janaa chahie
 Haqqani's statement comes ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit to be held in Kyrgyzstan on June 13-14

 Salman Khan's image has been greatly affected since Tubelight flopped
 yahaan tak ki sallu bhai ko film flop hone kii vajah se distributors ko hue nuksaan kii bharpai bhi kerani padi thi
 But now it seems that Salman has thought of fulfilling this compensation in another way
 ek report ke mutabik salmaan ne apni aane vaali film res-3 ke profit main 70 pratishat kii maang kii he
 Salman Khan is the Sultan of the Box Office
 magar jab tubalite flop hui, to unki is saakh ko kaaphi dhakka laga
 To save it, he also returned part of the loss to distributors on demand
 ab sallu bhai apni aane vaali filmon kii taiyaari main hai
 Of these, Race 3 is also a film
 dekan chronical main chhapi ek report par yakeen karen, to kaha ja rahaa he ki salmaan khan ne filmmekars se is film se hone vaale profit kaa 70 pratishat hissaa lene kii maang rakhi he
 Even before 50 percent of the stars have been taking stars, it is not new that film actors or actresses have sought a share in the profits of the film
 isse pehle bhi 50 pratishat tak profit share kiya jaataa rahaa he
 At times, these actors are also associated with the film Seabataur producers
 haalanki ab jab aamir khan film distributor bhi banane ja rahe hai, to lagata he ki sabhi top stars film distribution main bhi apana hissaa chaahate hai
 According to trade experts, if the film earns good money, then the stars associated with the film want to share it
 isamen kuch galat nahin he, haalanki res-3 ke bare main ai report ke anusaar 70 pratishat share kaaphi zyada he
 It remains to be seen what the producers of the film respond to
 jon ke film main na hone kii shart par sin kii thi filmbta den ki res-3 main salmaan khan negative role main honge
 The film will be directed by Remo d'souza
 is film main jaclin furnandis bhi ahm role main dikhengi
 The search for the rest of the actress is on
 inamen bipasha basu or desi shah jaise naam kaaphi aage chal rahe hai
 By the way, let me also tell that Salman Khan agreed to join this film only when it was decided that John Abraham would not be a part of this film

 However, Salman is currently shooting the last part of his film Tiger Zinda Hai, at the end of which he will start shooting for Race 3 next month

 india today grupah siio rahete hue, yani yuddh ke kuhase main, jaisaa ki aap ise kehete hai, kitaab likhnaa bahaduree kii baat he
 Usually ceos wait for their successes and then talk about it years later
 aapane is kitaab ko abhi likhane kaa faisla kyon kiya?satya nadelahjo ho chukaa he, use bayaan karne kii koshish yaa bhavishya ke bare main baat bhar karne ke liye kitaab likhane kii prerana nahin mili, balki yah badlaav kii prakriya ke bare main baat karne ke liye he
 Because i realized that what you do as a leader in any context — and what you do while living life — is about change
 mujhe laga ki isse guzarate hue is par vichaar karnaa apane jajbaat bayaan karke man ko halkaa karnaa or baton ko saaf karnaa he
 It is not enough to 'look back' in front of everyone's eyes
 isaki ek prerana mujhe steve (balmar, nadela ke purvavarti) se mulaakaat main mili jo unke company chhodie ke kareeb chah maheene baad hui thi
 i asked him, "are you writing a book?" He replied brilliantly, "no, looking back in the past is very boring
" '' or tabhi mujhe kaundha—bilkul abhi, jab main in sabake bichobich hum
 By no means am i saying that the journey is complete, change is over, or success is achieved
 par maine sochaa ki chalo microsoft kii apni yatra par, badlaav ke lamhon par or phir apane samaaj par vichaar kiya jaae
 These are the three things that really inspired it
 india today grupah aap microsoft kii aatma kii baat karte hai or kitaab main astitvvaadi sawaal poochhate hai
 Isn't this something Indian thing to do? Satya Nadella: As far as it is a matter of soul care, when i think of companies, strategy is talked about a lot, and obviously, that is the most important thing
 technology kii bahut baat kii jaati he, jaahir he, vah bhi behad ahm he
 You must have the right technology at the right time, and then you have to show it by your strategy and execution
 par lambey vakt ke, asal pratispardhi phaayde ke in do chhoron se jis baat par jor nahin diya jaataa, vah he makasad kaa ehsaas, pahchaan or samskruti
 When i look back, we are a very successful company for over 40 years
 or jab bhi un do chhoron par ham chijen sahi kar sake, hamane badi kamyaabi hasil kii
 When we did things that did not rest on the sense of purpose that looked around and said, "hey, who is doing the rest?" Or even jealousy, then it Did not succeed to yahi vajah he ki yah mul aatma kii baat karnaa or ise nae sire se khojna kam se kam shuruaati dauron main hamane jo kuch kiya, uskaa bahut bada hissaa rahaa he
 India Today Group: You ask the existential question of why Microsoft should exist and why it should do the things it is doing
 inke kya jawaab aapako mili?satya nadelahjab bill (gates) or paul (ellen) ne company shuru kii thi, tab microsoft ne jo pehla product taiyaar kiya, vah eltere ke liye pehla interprator tha
 At the very beginning of Microsoft, it defined everything that we did and everything we would do moving forward — that is, we created technology so that others could create more technology
 yahi ham hai
 Sometimes people ask me, "are you a consumer company? Are you a venture company? "" We are not both
 ham aisi company hai jo technology taiyaar karti he taaki duusare or zyada technology taiyaar kar saken
 According to me, this is what we are capable of
 ham kehete hai ki hamaara mishan duniya main har shaks or har sanghathan ko or zyada paane ke liye sakasham bananaa he
 Each of these words has deep meaning for us because we think about people and about people's institutions
 ham mahaj apni technology kaa jashn nahin manaa sakate
 Celebrating the success of others has to be done in developing our own technology
 microsoft kii yahi pahchaan he
 India Today Group: When you ask yourself why do you do what you do, what is the answer? Satya Nadella: When i was about 30 years old, a very powerful guy came
 us vakt main dag bergam ke saath kaam kar rahaa tha, jo abhi north dakota ke governor hai
 And they said something to me that completely changed my perspective on how i think about what i do
 unhone kaha, ''dekho, tum kaam main aakhirkaar or zyada vakt bitaane ja rahe ho (mere maamle main, main apane bacchon ke saath jitna vakt bitaauungaa, shaayad usase zyada microsoft main) to behatar hoga ki iske gahare myne hon
 It cannot be that you do something because it is a transactional thing
 '' or jab main peeche mudakar dekhtaa hum, to mere puure vakt main se jo meraa sabase santoshjanak vakt tha, vah vaaki kisi khaas technology yaa product yaa bijness process ko lekar nahin tha, balki hamane jo kiya yaa maine jo kuch apane aasapaas kiya, yah uske asar kii vajah se tha
 And the ability to gain strength from your own personal passion and philosophy, and to take on this long-running platform that Microsoft prepares, and to combine these two, is fantastic
 ho saktaa he, ham kabhi sahi na kar paaen, darasal maayusi jindagi kaa hissaa he, kisi bhi sandarbh kaa hissaa, par kam se kam yahi adarsh he
 This is what keeps me going
 india today grupah jab aapane shuruyaat kii thi tab kya kabhi sochaa tha ki aap aise logon ke samooh kaa hissaa honge jo duniya ko badal rahe hai?satya nadelassamain jo sochataa tha, jo mere bheetar gaharaai se samaaya tha, vah utsukata kaa ehsaas tha
 The ability to see things, the opportunities, and believe it is fantastic
 mujhe microsoft main aisa koi kaam yaad nahin aata jo mujhe mila or maine sochaa ho, ''he bhagwaan, yah kaam to usase kam ahm he jo pehle mere paas tha
 "I always felt that this is the most wonderful work, this is the most wonderful opportunity, how thrilled i am to find it
" yah mere pita, meri maa kaa kuch mail or mere upar unka asar he, jo ajeeb mail tha
 But it created something where there was no such thing as "oh, look for something next"
 iske ulat hota yah tha ki ''jo mila he use manjuur karo or vaaki, vaaki iskaa puraa phayda uthaao, taaki gahare se gaharaa asar pade
 "perhaps more than anything else, it has made me who i am
" india today grupah aaj aap jo kuch jaanate hai, uske saath agar aap kuch varshon pehle vaale nadela se baat karen, to kya kahenge?satya nadelatogar mujhe peeche lautnaa pade, to main use hi lagu karuunga jisaki mujhe ab behatar samaj he
 Because such a big life is lived in the hope of something
 yah ghisi-pity baat he, par yah sabase taqatvar he, yah ki aapako us lamhaa hoshiyaari se jeene ke kaabil hona hota he kyonki kul milakar yahi aapako mila he
 This is difficult to understand
 par shaayad yahi vah he jisane mere liye sabase zyada fark daalaa he
 India Today Group: Bill Gates in the role of your book speaks of the beginning of the digital revolution at this time
 yah hairat kii baat he
 Are we not in the middle of this revolution and are we not moving towards its peak? Satya Nadella: It is interesting
 puure maanav itihaas main hue in baari-bharkam badlaavon ke bare main main dher sara padhata hum
 Apparently the big change was the Industrial Revolution because it is amazing to think what the Industrial Revolution did
 1750 tak duniya kaa jidipi tamaam hisson main (agar aap duniya ke kuch hisse chhod den), khaskar asia, europe ke zyaadaatar hisson main, ek samaan tha
 In terms of per capita income and quality of life, it was not as unequal as it is now
 or phir audyogic kranti ne ise puri tarah badal daalaa
 Robert J
 gordon kii ek shandaar kitaab he (da rij and fall of american grotha da yues standard of living sins da civil war) jo america utpaadakta ke chadhgaye or girane ke bare main baat karti he
 For example, he says that if you were walking on foot in Manhattan in 1870, it was most likely that your shoes would have horse dung
 jabaki agar aap 1940 main jaaen, to aap or main vahaan daakhil hokar aisa mahasoos kar sakate hai ki haa, hamaare paas koi soshal media or koi televijan nahin he, par hamaare paas nalon main pani, garm pani, nalsaji, kaaren, air condishning, har vah cheez he jiske ham aadi hai or yah bahut kamaal kii baat lagegi
 And this is exactly what happened at the age of 70
 or isliye main ek kism se kahata hum, vaah, chauthi audyogic kranti main, jo digital kranti he, kitni barabari he? gordon khud bhi utpaadakta ke phaaydon ke bare main baat karte hai jo jahiraa taur par aarthik vruddhi main sabase moolbhoot hai, jo puure samaaj ke laabh uthaane ke liye moolbhoot hai
 This happened from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, and much of this is attributed to the advent of personal computers in the workplace
 tab se ham itane upabhokta ke pichhalggu—balki main kahuunga, upbhog ke pichhalggu—ho gaye hai ki hamen aarthik samruddhi kaa vah str hasil nahin hua jo digital technology kii vajah se zyada barabari se banta hua ho saktaa tha
 So from this perspective, i think that we need more technology, and that technology needs a wider impact
 india today grupah to technology main vah agali badi chijen kya hai jo ise takat dengi?satya nadelauekam se kam teen badi chijen hai
 One is: how can technology be made so that it is more accessible to more people among us? The decider will be when the computer is in front of your eyes and you are not even making a difference between the real world and the virtual or virtual world
 yahi vah he jise ham mishrit yatharth duniya kehete hai
 So this is one aspect of basic shifting and change
 doosraa pahalu he intelligence, masini intelligence yaa artificial intelligence
 One of the basic things that i talk about a lot is still very rare and unique in this glut of computing and technology, and that is the attention of human
 akeli raahat isamen artificial intelligence sareekhee kisi cheez kii he jo mujhe un chizon par dhyaan dene main madad kare jo mere liye or meri jindagi ke liye or mere sanghathan ke liye, mere parivaar ke liye myne rakhti he
 So, Artificial Intelligence is the second aspect which is going to have a significant impact on the lives, organizations and overall economies of humans
 or phir aakhri pahalu yah he ki agar ham computing interphes or tajurbon kii is bharmaar ko or zyada paidaa karnaa chaahate hai, har us cheez ko jo artificial intelligence kii takat se chalati he, to aapako dher sara compute karnaa hoga
 In fact, you have to go further than the classical computer, which is beyond Moore's law, because we are reaching the boundary of physics in terms of our ability to get more out of that architecture
 or yahi vah jagah he jahaan main sochataa hum ki kwantum computing sareekhee koi cheez ise puri tarah badal sakati he
 We have a very exciting program here at Microsoft, some more people are also working on it
 isamen bhautikee, ganit or computer vigyaan kii buniyadi kamyaabiyon ko ek saath aana hoga taaki anivaary taur par computing ke ek nae rup ko ijad kar saken
 India Today Group: You mentioned going beyond Moore's law
 kya koi nayaa niyam he jiske bare main aap technology kii tarakkee kii khatir soch saken?satya nadelatogar koi universal niyam he, to ek baat maine yah anubhav kii he ki jab bhi aap maan lete hai ki aapane aakhri divaais, aakhri computer, sabase sarvyaapee computer khoj liya he, tab aapako sirf itnaa karnaa hota he ki thodi der intjaar karen, vahaan or zyada computing hogi, kam computing nahin hogi
 This will be my equivalent
 india today grupah to chaliye, ham ise 'satya kaa niyam' kehete hai (thahaake)
 You have written so much about this that technology is democratizing the lives of people all over the world
 kya aap sochate hai ki ham ek aise padaav par pahunch rahe hai jahaan ham baat kar rahe hai ki technology ko koun bana rahaa or niyantrit kar rahaa he? kya isse duniya ke vibhinn hisson ke bich gairbarabari badaae ja rahi he?satya nadelahsaaf kahuun to yah un bade sawaalon main se ek he jo mere man main uthte rahe hai
 i always wondered what was happening in Aurangzeb's court when the Industrial Revolution was going on
 masalan, vahaan kaa maahaul kaisaa rahaa hoga? kunjee kuch aisi prathit hoti heru jab ek baar technology aapako sulabh ho jaati he to uskaa aap kya karte hai? hindustan ke maamle main, pehle aksharon se milakar bane is shabd kaa log istemaal karte hai, hindustan kii abisidi, yani estrology, bollywood, cricket or darshan, yaa jise aap kahenge ki kuch bhi nayaa karne ke lihaaj se ek kism se hindustan kii dilchaspee bas inhen sabamein he
 You have to go beyond this
 aap keval isi baat par khush nahin ho sakate ki are vaah, har kisi ke paas smartphone he
 What are they doing? What is its downward result? You are not creating a digital edge unless there is an acute use of technology in a very long way within the local economy
 jahiraa taur par ham jis bhi desh main hissedari karte hai, vahaan ham munafa chaahate hai, par ham is baat kii bhi bahut parvaah karte hai ki hamaari technology ke istemaal kii vajah se us desh ko kya munafa ho rahaa he
 India Today Group: Which path should we follow, in the sense that there will be countries that will be able to increase their GDP by using technology? Satya Nadella: In my opinion, for every country, for every country's entrepreneurial class, for every country It is very important for industrial policy that they really want digital technology for their agenda as the most focused priority in the whole economy
 Please use g
 jin jagahon par yah hua he, unamem se ek meri raay main hindustan he
 India Stack is a great way of saying that okay, let's take digital technology, make it more relevant so that it can bring more services to every Indian citizen
 or phir lenden kii laagat ko kam karte hai kyonki isi se aarthik vruddhi ko raftaar milegi
 For example, it is a good way of forging both industrial policy and the public sector, how they work and then of course connecting it with what is happening in India through all the entrepreneurial activities
 lekin main yah sochataa hum ki yah bahut bade paimaane par hona hoga
 And sometimes i think let's get protectionist, but it doesn't work, because if you don't have access to technology then being protectionist only means that you will be left behind
 isliye aapako bahut, bahut acha hona hoga taaki aap samaj paaen ki vah secular badlaav kya he jo ho rahaa he
 Do not be in a denial mindset
 yah pakkaa karen ki isamen lagane vaali chijen jutaayein, phir zyada oonche mulya ke nattejey paidaa karen jo hamaari apni arthvyavastha ke sandarbh main or phir vyapak duniya ke sandarbh main praasangik hon
 India Today Group: When it comes to the Indian IT sector, it appears under pressure and may have to invent itself afresh
 aap unhen kya salaah denge?satya nadelassamain do baaten kahuunga
 It is very important for any different company to start from scratch
 iskaa matlab technology kii nai lahar ko pakad paanaa bhar nahin he, balki aisa karne ke saath-saath apane bijness model ko badalanaa bhi he
 In many cases this is the more difficult part because adapting to changes in technology is one thing, but dealing with business model changes is fundamentally more difficult
 kyonki aapke munaafe badalte hai or aapako uske dauraan ek kism se vaaki sanbhaalanaa padataa he
 At the same time it becomes very difficult to get those permits from the public markets, but you have to do that
 jab main mudakar microsoft kii taraf dekhtaa hum to hamaare 45 saal main—meraa matlab he mere apane 25 saal main—hamaare astitv ko hone vaale khataron kii taadaad alag-alag rahi hai
 And actually, that's the way i measure it, which is that in every five years someone should gush in my ears in a different way that oh, there's a new person that's going to destroy you
 or agar aapke saath aisa nahin hota to kuch na kuch gadabadi he
 But overall when i see what is happening in the context of India, the reality is that technology is now being discussed on a much larger scale, whether it is in adopting its public sector technology with Aadhaar , Or whether they are Indian start-ups who are actually inventing fundamentally new things for the Indian economy
 or phir beshak ve ise niryaat bhi kar sakate hai, par bhartiya arthvyavastha anuthe tareeke se digitise ho rahi he, badi companiyon kaa nirmaan kar rahi he, yah utsahjanak baat he
 Therefore, according to me, it is a matter of adopting new technology, intensive use of it, and generating profits
 meri raay main bhartiya ity main aglaa kaam yahi hona he
 It is more profound, more comprehensive, entrepreneurial energy is enough in the country, the country's talent is amazing
 india today grupah aap ek sarkaar ko, masalan bharat kii sarkaar ko, product technology ko kahaan le jate dekhte hai? ve maukey kahaan hai or sarkaar ko kya karnaa chahie?satya nadelatogar aap, jaise saarvajanik kshetra yaa sarkaar he, asal main karadaataaon ke dhan ko kushalta ke saath kharch karne main technology kaa istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, to aap apane nagarikon kii bhalaai nahin kar rahe hai
 Therefore, the use of technology to run the government's work in the most efficient manner is the number one task
 meri pehali salaah yahi hogi, chaahe vah dilli main ho yaa washington main yaa landan main yaa kahin bhi
 The second thing, of course from the perspective of industrial policy, is to know what are the various ways for you to promote technology and technology development so that you can achieve more economic growth everywhere
 main samajhataa hum yah behad ahm he
 i think that there is no shortcut to this and especially in democratic countries you have to find legal solutions that what is the balance between privacy and security in any country is the most important
 or isliye mer mutabik in buniyadi muddon se sahi kanoonee dhaanche ke saath, jo samajhataa bhi ho or maanata bhi ho, nipat paanaa, yahi technology he
 You cannot use the legal framework that was built for the 20th century in the 21st century
 yah buniyadi mudda he
 i think different types of disharmony are being born today
 hindustan ke sandarbh main, niztaa buniyadi adhikaar he, par vahiin agar aap thik usee hindustani naagarik ke vaaste mulya paidaa karne ke liye data kaa istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, to aap us hindustani naagarik kaa bura hi kar rahe hai
 So the question of how to enable both sides, i think this is one of the challenges that we have to overcome as a society and as a global society
 india today grupah niztaa ke sawaal par, ab bank hamaare dhan kii hifaazat karte hai, par aapaki jaisi companiyaan or cloud par aadhaarit samaadhaan darasal hamaare data, hamaari pahchaan or bahut kuch kii hifaazat karti hai
 So how daunting is this challenge? Satya Nadella: When i think of the principles that guide the way we do what we do, privacy, security, being obedient to the laws of the country are the most important to us
 isliye jab ham apane cloud infrastracchar ke bare main sochate hai, tab main un sabake bare main sochataa hum
 The first is to have absolutely state-of-the-art security — though most people think of security in a way that it is a one-of-a-kind thing
 aisa nahin he, kyonki ham jaanate hai ki suraksha gym jane kii tarah he, aapako har subah uthanaa padataa he or feet rahane ke liye roj gym janaa padataa he
 It is not possible that you see other people going to the gym and say, oh, i feel better
 yah suraksha ko lekar pehali baat he
 One of the most important thing is that the larger your attitude towards operational safety, the better your capabilities around safety
 lekin ham atyaadhunik se kabhi santusht nahin hote or ham simaaon ko hameshaa or peeche dhakel rahe hai
 The second thing is about privacy
 niztaa ko lekar main sochataa hum-ahm baat bahut-bahut paardarshee hona he ki kis lihaaj se ki data kya he, ise kisalie icttha kiya ja rahaa he, iskaa kisalie istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 So in order to hand over the command back to the user, whether it is an institutional user or an end user, i think that the European rules related to GDPR (general Data Protection Regulation) clearly set the maximum standards of the world
 Going, what does this mean for every private user
 to yah ek or bahut bada hissaa he jisamen ham nivesh kar rahe hai or jisaki disha main ham kaam kar rahe hai
 The third aspect is, for example, why we built data centers in India
 ham hindustan main anivaary taur par ye aadhunik factoriyaan bana rahe hai, jinamein hamane baari-bharkam data centre nivesh kiye hai
 And this is so that the data of India can remain within the digital sovereignty of India, so that the public sector can rely on it, and then follow any regulatory audit, which the Government of India wants to run or any other agency
 Wants to india today grupah kya zyada mushkil he, usulon par chalanaa yaa apwaad ke taur par unase hat janaa?satya nadeladuniya bhar main kaayade-kanoonon kii or niztaa tathaa suraksha ko lekar duniya bhar main santulan kii thodi aparipakvahalat main hamaare sareekhee tech companiyon ke liye usulon par chalanaa behad ahm baat he
 This ultimately assumes that we are bound by the laws and regulations of different countries
 ham kanoon se upar nahin hai
 We operate in the context of individual countries and within their legal framework
 lekin aisa kehane ke baad ham manamaane dhang se kaam nahin kar sakate
 i think the most important thing for the world is that it should not depend on the ethics of any CEO or on any principles of any company
 lekin hamen maananaa hoga ki hamaare vakt ke sabase ahm muddon par ek santulan sadhana duniya ke liye fouran bahut jaruri he, jaise keval ek misaal duun to niztaa or suraksha ke bich santulan kya hoga
 This is very important
 yah sirf hindustan main hi ahm nahin he, sabhi deshon ke liye ahm he, or unhen saath aana hoga or kahana hoga ki hamane ek saajha samaj kaayam kar lee he, jaise hamane maanavadhikaron ko lekar yaa jalwaayu parivartan ko lekar yaa duusare kai muddon ko lekar kaayam kii he
 You have to achieve this, a global consensus has to be made on this
 agar ham yah nahin banaate hai, to hamen iske nattejey bhugatne honge
 India Today Group: Finally, have you ever thought of returning to India and directly helping change things? Satya Nadella: There is no doubt in my mind that i owe a lot to my heritage and my upbringing in India
 hindustan se mere gahare judaav hai or ve kabhi meraa pallaa nahin chodenge
 What i have right now is an opportunity — thanks to the job i have today and the platforms i have today — so that i can contribute not only to the country in which i was born, but also to the world
 isliye aisa kuch bhi or sab kuch jo main waapas hindustan ko ek kism se yogadan dene ke liye kar saktaa hum, to vah main karnaa chahta hum

 Maria was also angry with the media for mentioning only the Sheena Bora murder case after 36 years of police service and the investigation of a large and important case in it
 31 janvari ko apane kaarykaal ke aakhri din rakesh maaria ne apane daftar main patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha ki achaanak se hue tabadale kaa unhen koi dukh nahin he
 It is a matter of sadness that the officers who disclosed such an important case that was buried for three years did not get credit for their work

 According to Maria, he himself wrote a letter for transfer
 maaria ne daawa kiya ki homeguard kaa diji banaaye jane ko lekar unhen rajya sarkaar se koi naaraazgi nahin he
 But the pain of retiring from the post of DG of a home guard called a side posting of an ATS chief with Mumbai Police Commissioner and an important post like Mumbai Crime Branch could be easily read on his face
 tippaniyan During the 26 / 11 terror attack on Rakesh Maria, the question has been raised about the operation of the operation by sitting in the control room instead of taking the spot on the terrorists

 He further added that there is also the grief of the security personnel dying in the 26 / 11 terror attack

 When asked that you had received a job offer from abroad due to the remarkable work done in the 26 / 11 terror attack, will you look at it now? Maria laughs in her familiar style, saying, leave some things to write in books too

 rakesh maaria par 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke dauraan aatankiyon se maukey par loha lene kii bajaay control room main baithkar oparation ko anjaam dene par bhi sawaal uth chukaa he
 Referring to that, Rakesh Maria said that in that attack many policemen did their duty, showed bravery but only honor was given to those who were injured or martyred

 Sadly, i was not on the front in that attack and could not get injured or martyred
 aage unhone ye bhi joda ki 26 / 11 aatanki hamale main suraksha karmiyon ke marane kaa dukh bhi he
 Not speaking much about future plans, Maria said that now he will devote more time to writing a book on the dozens of cases he has solved and will try to enjoy living as a normal citizen

 pashchim bengal main sharada chit fund maamle main jaanch ke dauraan sibiai team ke kolkata police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ke awaas par jane ke baad maamla puraa raajnneetik rang letaa ja rahaa he
 After hearing in this regard in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Chief Justice Justice Ranjan Gogoi ordered that Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar should appear before the CBI and he should cooperate in the investigation
 court ke is faisle ke baad kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki mamata banerjee niyamon kaa paalan nahin kar raheen
 She is obstructing the CBI investigation
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat kaa faisla aane ke baad kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki mukhyamantri mamata banerjee niyamon kaa paalan nahin kar rahi hai or vah sibiai jaanch main rukaawat paidaa kar rahi hai
 Does Mamta not have a duty to investigate the matter honestly
 vah aakhir police kamishnar ko kyon bachaana chaahati thi
 This is our important question
 unhone aage kaha, 'court ke aaj faisle par main koi tippanee nahin karuunga kyonki court kaa nirnay apni jagah par he, lekin main ek raajnneetik sawaal uthaanaa chahta hum ki vah pesh kyon nahin ho rahe the
 It becomes the duty of all
 sibiai ko aakhir vahaan kyon janaa padaa
 Earlier, he was also summoned three-four times in this regard
 'ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki chintaa kii baat he ki desh ke itihaas main pehali baar hua he ki kamishnar level kaa police adhikari dharne par baith gaya
 It is a matter of concern for the governance of the country
 kya yah samvidhan kaa ulanghan nahin he ki amit shah ke helicopter ko roka jaae
 Yogi's helicopter should not be allowed to land
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko unke jansabha ke liye chota maidan diya jaae

 He has filed a petition in the court stating that the CBI was on a secret mission
 main aapako bataa duun ki unka mishan bhi sikret tha or unka bhi agenda bhi sikret tha
 His secret agenda was that the state government should be distabilized in some way
 grih mantri ne kaha tha ki ham governor se report manga rahe hai to inaki manshaa saaf he
 He further said that there should be action on corruption, no one speaks against him, but those accused are sitting with him
there is no action against unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hoti
 The TMC mps who possess them should be investigated by the CBI and those who are sitting a minister in Assam, their names have also come up in the Saradha scam and should be investigated against them as well
 lekin inkaa doosraa agenda he ki ek aisa vaataavaran paidaa karo jisase ki koi doosraa kadam uthaaya ja sake

 This is our moral victory
 unhone aage kaha ki centre samvidhan kaa ulanghan kar rahi he, ham supreme court ke aadesh kaa paalan karenge

 lokapal vidheyak ko lekar anna hajaare ke prastaavit anshan se pehle congress ne un par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki anna ko pehle apane khilaaf ek ayog kii jaanch ke gambhir nateezon par safai deni chahie
 The party also accused Anna of trying to create instability in the country
 party pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha, ‘‘16 agast se hone vaale anshan kaa bhrashtachar yaa lokapal vidheyak ke mudde se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He said that the Justice PB Sawant Commission has exposed the morality of Hazare, the results of which have been found to be steeped in corruption
 ayog ne varsh 2003 main tatkaaleen maharashtra sarkaar ke chaar mantriyon ke khilaaf hajaare dwaara lagaaye gayi bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch kii thi
 Tiwari said, "the fast from August 16 has nothing to do with corruption or the Lokpal Bill
" yadi aisa he to hajaare ko pehle bhrashtachar ke gambhir aaropon main safai deni hogi
 What is his explanation of the serious consequences
 desh jaananaa chahta he
 He said, "I believe that Hazare and his associates need to respond to the Sawant Commission results
" ’’ party ne hajaare par suniyojit tareeke se desh main asthirataa failaane kaa or sansad kaa apmaan karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Tiwari said that so far a lot of tolerance has been shown towards him
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jab koi asthirataa laane kaa prayaas karata he to isse nipatna (muqabla karnaa) kisi bhi raajnneetik dal kii jimmedaari ban jaati he
 Tiwari alleged that Team Anna was made up of "impractical fascists, cloaked in society's mask of Maoists, hidden anarchists who hide behind right-wing forces and receive money from invisible donors whose strings from abroad Can be connected
 ’’anna par sansad kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaate hue congress netaa ne anya raajnneetik dalon se bhi iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kii apil kii
 He said, "some people are bent on spreading chaos and think that this is their birthright, while the truth is that five ministers held a series of talks with them (on the issue of Lokpal)"
 ’’haalanki tiwari ne in sawaalon kaa sidhaa jawaab nahin diya ki maharashtra kii tatkaaleen sarkaar ne in nishkarshon ke baavjood hajaare ke khilaaf karrwai kyon nahin kii, jisane saavant ayog kaa gathan kiya tha or jiskaa netritv unki party kar rahi thi
 He said, "the question is of morality, not why the Maharashtra government has been soft on Hazare
 ’’ samvaadadaata sammelan main tiwari ne hajaare ke chaar nyaason se jude maamle main saavant ayog kii jaanch ke nateezon kaa byoraa bhi padhaa
 These include Hind Swaraj Trust, formed in 1995 for the purpose of rural development and moral education
 unhone daawa kiya ki nyaayamurti saavant ne 116 pannon kii apni report main hajaare ko apane janmdin samaaroh par trust se 2
 2 lakh rupees
 unhone kaha ki ayog ke anusaar unka krity avaidh he or bhrashtachar ke samaan he
 Regarding the Yadav Baba Teaching Broadcasting Circle, the commission said that the trust has not given its accounts for 20 years
 tiwari ne aarope lagaaya ki ek or trust bhrashtachar virdohi jan andolan santhaan ke bare main ayog ne nishkarsh nikaala ki kuch kaaryakarta jabaran vasuuli, blackmel, anya logon kii sampatti jabt karne ke madhyam se manch kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 He also claimed that Hazare, who called for transparency, did not respond to a question asked under RTI about his contribution during his service in the army
 tiwari ne kaha ki is saal 27 may ko unhen artiai ke tahat sawaal bheja gaya tha or aaj tak uskaa jawaab nahin diya gaya he
 He told Anna's colleagues Justice Santosh Hegde and Shanti Bhushan whether he sought any clarification on the findings of the Sawant Commission from Hazare
 tiwari ne pradhanmantri ko likhe anna ke patr ke lahaze par bhi unhen aade haathon lete hue kaha ki hajaare ne maryaada or shishtachar kii hadein paar kar di hai
 He said, "it is an insult not to the Prime Minister but to the national flag
" ham poochna chaahate hai ki vah kis tareeke se bhrashtachar ke mudde ko uthaa rahe hai jabaki ucchtam nyaayalay ke ek nyaayadhish kii adhyakshata main gathit ayog ne unhen sir se lekar pair tak bhrashtachar main lipt paaya he
 Tiwari said that the government is tolerant, but if someone tries to cross the Laxman line, it needs to show its place
 kya sarkaar ko hajaare ke saath baatcheet kerani chahie, is sawaal par tiwari ne kaha ki unhen yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki vah kis mudde par anshan kar rahe hai jab lokapal vidheyak sansad main he
 He said, "we have demolished the foundation of his sand fort
 ’’congress pravaktaa is sawaal kaa jawaab taal gayi ki kya hajaare ke andolan ke baad bane halaat 1974 main jai prakaash narayan ke halaat se milte julate hai
 On comparing Hazare to Ramdev, he said that he would not comment on it
 desh main halaat apatkaal se purv jaise lagane sambandhi bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke prashnon par ulataa hamalaa karte hue tiwari ne karnataka ke avaidh khanan kaa mudda uthaate hue kaha ki gadakari ko raashtra ko bataanaa chahie ki vah vivaadaaspad reddy bandhu ko aashirwad dene bellari kyon gayi

 court is report ke aane kaa 20 minute tak intjari karata rahaa or sunwaayee rukii rahi

 yahaan baat ho rahi he mashhoor geetkaar or lekhak javed akhtar kii, jinke mutabik danga uttar pradesh main nahin, balki bihar main hua he
 In fact, on micro-blogging website Twitter, Akhtar Saheb has tweeted a tweet, in which he wrote Muzaffarnagar of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh who is suffering from riots
 aapako bataa den ki mujffarpur bihar kaa ek jila he
 After a molestation incident, communal violence erupted in Muzaffarnagar and surrounding areas of UP

 Javed Akhtar is also deeply saddened by this incident and has compared it to rape

 In his tweet, he wrote Muzaffarnagar as Muzaffarpur
 unke twit ke mutabik, 'jo kuch bhi mujffarpur main hua, vah rashtriya shame he
 Unity, harmony, peace and centuries old culture have been raped by conspiring there
 'khabar likhe jane tak 256 log is twit ko ri-twit kar chuke hai
 School time is the best time of life
 lekin jab ham skool main hote hai to hamen skool janaa pasand nahin hota or exam ke samay to hamen skool se nafrat hi hone lagati he
 When we leave school and come to college, we come to know that the moments spent in school are the happiest and memorable moments of life
 vaise to skool time ko ham bahut miss karte hai lekin ham aapako bataa rahe hai aisi 10 chijen jo har ladki apane skool ke bare main miss karti he
 1
 subah jaldi uthanaa:apane skool time main ham marning alarm se kitni nafrat karte the
 At that time we knew how deep we had a relationship with our beds
 2
 Getting ready: How hard we worked to make our boring school uniforms stylish
 choti skirt khareednaa or mojey ko neeche pahananaa trend tha
 If you had to meet a special in school - what to say
 tab bina mechap ham sabase sundar laganaa chaahate the
 3
 senior par krash:senior ko chup-chup kar dekhne ke din bhi kitne achche the
 Almost everyone used to have a good looking senior in school, so that our eyes did not turn away
 lekin hamen kabhi usase baat karne kii himmat nahin hui
 4
 kejual vier pahanane kaa din:skool main jis din kejual kapade pahanane hote the us din hamaari khushi kaa thikaana hi nahin hota tha
 It was permissible to wear casual clothes on his birthday till class 7 but after that there was a slight reluctance
 tab ferewel or class assembly tak hi yah parampara simat ke rah gai thi
 5
 berthde or canteen food:skool main apane berthde par bahut khushi hoti thi
 Even though the celebration was simple but we had a very special feel
 'happp xxrep 6 y Biiirr xxrep 5 t xxrep 5 h dd xxrep 4 a xxrep 4 y tt xxrep 4 o yyyooo xxrep 4 u !' jab puri class gaati thi to pataa nahin chalata tha ki kiski taraf dekhnaa he
 After this there was a treat in the canteen
 6
 School Fashions: It was fun to prepare for competition and school functions
 practice ke liye skool timming ke baad bhi skool main rahanaa, duusare section ke students ke saath masti karnaa, snacks khaane kaa alag hi majaa tha
 School elections also had their own craze
 chunavi bhaashan kii taiyaari karnaa, prachaar karnaa or thodi raajnneeti bhi skool time ke yaadgaar palon main se ek he
 7
 skool bel:har period khatm hone ke baad bel kaa bajnaa bahut sukun detaa tha lekin chuttee kii ghanti kii tulana kisi or cheez se nahin kii ja sakati
 8
 sajaa milanaa:class ke baahar kaan pakad kar khadaa hona, munh par oongli rakhana- aisi sajaa milanaa un dinon aam baat thi
 The joy of smiling at the teacher's scolding was different
 9
 Teacher: Our teachers were the most proud of us after our parents
 ve hamaari har sambhav sahaayta karne ko taiyaar rahete the
 It is from them that we have received the greatest gift of life - 'knowledge'
 10
 Friend: The friendship that happens at school is the deepest
 skool time main jaise dost banate hai vaise jindagi ke kisi mukaam par nahin banate
 Our school friends grow up with us and know all our things
 wo hamaare saport system hote hai
 The vacancy has emerged at the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Noida

 All these allegations have been made by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 2015 main prachand bahumat ke saath satta sanbhaalane vaale aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ne koi bhi mauka nahin choda, jab dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main roda atakane kaa aarope centre kii modi sarkaar par nahin lagaaya
 Even the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Aam Aadmi Party fought Delhi on the issue of full statehood so that the Delhi government can take all the decisions for the people themselves
 lekin in tamaam aarope-pratyarope or jubaani jang ke baavjood kejariwal kii party ek bhi loksabhaa seat nahin jeet saki or 23 may ko nattejey aane ke baad se hi unke andaaj bilkul badale najar aa rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal has now completely changed his line
 wo baar-baar centre sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam karne kii baat kah rahe hai
 With Kejriwal congratulating PM Modi on the victory, the pledge that Kejriwal took to demand cooperation is going on continuously
 beete 21 june ko lambey vakt baad jab kejariwal or piem modi kii baithak hui to usamen kejariwal ne pradhanmantri se mohalla clinics or dilli ke sarkari skool dekhne kaa aagrah kiya
 Arvind Kejriwal's meeting with PM Modi (file photo) After this, recently when Arvind Kejriwal arrived to inaugurate the CCTV in New Delhi assembly constituency, he spoke to the media and then worked with the central government to work for the betterment of Delhi
 Somewhere uparajyapal se kejariwal kii mulakatanajeeb jang se lekar maujuuda uparajyapal anil baijal tak, kisi bhi alji se arvind kejariwal kii nahin ban pai
 Even on the issue of not passing the file of door-to-door ration scheme, Kejriwal sat on a dharna in the office of the Lieutenant Governor with the entire cabinet and stayed there for several days
 lekin isi hafte arvind kejariwal ne uparajyapal anil baijal ke awaas pahunchakar kareeb 25 minute tak unase mulaakaat kii or bhrasht adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar charchaa kii
 Arvind Kejriwal during the meeting with LG Anil Baijal clashed at the inauguration ceremony
 The Center and the Kejriwal government stood firm at the inauguration of Skywalk at ITO, Delhi in October 2018
 antat: kendriya mantri hardip singh puri ne uparajyapal ke saath milakar udghaatan kar diya or kejariwal sarkaar ko aamantrit hi nahin kiya gaya
 It was overturned by the Kejriwal government and in November 2018, the signature bridge on the Yamuna River was inaugurated by Arvind Kejriwal
 is samaaroh main centre sarkaar ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 But Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari reached and there was also a push-up
 udghaatan samaaroh main aae sathin tamaam khataason ke baad mangalvaar ko centre or dilli sarkaar kii saajha tasviir saamne ai jab okhla main sivej treetment plant kaa udghaatan kiya gaya
 Union Water Power Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were both present at the event
 kejariwal ne iske liye modi sarkaar kaa dhanyavad bhi kiya or twit main likhaa ki centre sarkaar ke sahyog ke liye bahut bahut shukriya
 i am confident that together we will definitely be able to clean the Yamuna river soon
 vahiin, jab pichley maheene maheene dilli ke andar 24 ghante main 9 murder hue to aam aadmi party netaaon samet khud kejariwal ne dilli police se twitor par sawaal puche
 But in the next statement to the media, he again spoke of working together by the Center and the Delhi government
 haalanki, baat jahaan tak dilli police kii he to ab tak kejariwal ne grahamantri amit shah se mulaakaat nahin kii he, jinke adheen dilli police aati he
 In this way, there have been many such occasions since the Lok Sabha election results, when Kejriwal's statements have not only made it easy for the Modi government but he is also repeatedly talking about cooperation
 chaar saal se zyada ke kaarykaal main kejariwal kaa aisa rukh pehali baar dekhne ko mila he
 Holika Dahan will be performed on the full moon (march 16) of Phalgun month and the next day on March 17, Dhulendi (holi) will be celebrated by playing colors and colors
 shastron ke anusaar holikaa dahan ke aath din purv holashtak lag jaataa he
 According to this, no auspicious rites are performed till Holi from Holachakta
 shastreey parampara ke anusaar shanivaar 8 march ko holashtak shuru ho gaya or ab 16 sanskaar jaise namakaran sanskaar, janeu sanskaar, grih pravesh, vivaah sanskaar jaise shubh kaaryon par roak lag gai he
 These auspicious works will start only after Dhulendi
 holashtak ke dauraan hi tara ast hone ke chalate vivaah sanskaar ab lagbhag dedh maheene baad yani 14 april ke baad hi kiye ja sakenge
 It is also believed that Prahlada was tortured a lot from Ashtami to Purnima in the eight days before Holi
 yaatnaaon se bhare un aath dinon ko hi ashubh maanane kii parampara ban gai
 In Hindu religion, no auspicious work is done in the first eight days of Holi in any house

 Manoj Shukla says that Holashtak is related to the legend of Lord Vishnu's devotee Prahlada and his father the tyrannical Hiranyakashyap

 Anyone who worshiped Lord Vishnu in his kingdom was sentenced to death

 According to the story, Prahlada, son of King Hiranyakashipu, was a devotee of Lord Vishnu
 apane putr prahlada kii vishnu bhakthi ke bare main jab raja ko pataa chalaa to usne prahlada ko samajhaayaa magar prahlada ne bhagwaan vishnu kii bhakthi kerani nahin chodi
 Enraged by this, the king sentenced his son to death
 raja ke aadesh par sainikon ne bhakt prahlada ko anek yatnaaen deen
 He was left among the wild animals to die, drowned in the river, thrown from the high mountain

 Finally, the king ordered Prahlada to burn him alive by sitting on his sister Holika's lap
 raja kii bahan holikaa ko vardaan tha ki vah agni main bhi bhasma nahin hogi
 Prahlada was saved by God grace but Holika got burnt

Whereas in fact the Prime Minister himself is morally and directly responsible for this

 The latest issue of Panchajanya states, "the country is not the property of the Congress to arbitrarily loot government treasury and the public should shut their eyes

 ek 'missd kol' ne ek parivaar ko unka khoyaa hua baccha mila diya
 In fact, a 14-year-old teenager living in the Shahabad Dairy area of delhi went missing a year ago
 police or gharavaalon ne use khub talasha, lekin koi suraag nahin mila
 Last month, a missed call on Kishore's father's mobile sparked the face of the police
 ye kol jammu-kashmir se hui thi, jahaan se kishor kii family kaa koi taalluk nahin he
 So Crime Branch took that number seriously
 joint seepi rabindra yadav ke anusaar, police ne servilans par focus kiya to kishor kaa pataa mil gaya
 The child told that he had left home after being afraid of studies
 veshno devi darshan karne gaya tha
 On the way he kept eating from the anchor
 jammu-kashmir jaakar use laga ki ghar lautne par pita bahut naaraaz honge, isliye vahiin rah gaya
 The hungry and thirsty was wandering
 usee dauraan vaishno devi maarg par khachchar chalaane vaale kailash kii najar us par padi
 He understood that the teenager had run away from home
 polisake anusaar, khachchar vaale kii 7 betia hai, lekin betaa ek nahin he
 So he kept that teenager like his son

 But even after a seven-and-a-half-hour long meeting, these questions were met with roundly answers

 But according to sources, the Election Commission does not want to create such a spectacle about machines
 ayog is baat ke liye taiyaar he ki jin iviem mashin ke jariye haal main chunaav hue hai unhen raajnneetik partiyon ko diya jaae or yah sabit karne ko kaha jaae ki unamem chhedchhad hui he yaa phir unako is tarah se hack kiya ja saktaa he ki usase manachaaha nateeja nikle

 baithak main zyaadaatar partiyaan is baat par sahamat thim ki paper trail mashin ke jarieiviem mashinase chunaav karana behatar or paardarshee tarika hoga
 But there are some parties who want to leave the EVM machine and return to the era of ballot paper

 In the all-party meeting, the Election Commission had made complete preparations to make the EVM machine reliable on its behalf and a presentation was made in detail in front of the political parties
 baithak main chunaav main votaron ko rijhaane ke liye rishwat dene ko sangey aparaadh banane ke liye, raajnneetik partiyon ko milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banane ke liye or aparaadhiyon ko chunaav maidan main aane se rokane ke liye kadamon par bhi charchaa hui
 The 7 national parties and 35 regional parties who came to the meeting made their views before the Election Commission
 lekin in baton par koi aam raay nahin ban pai
 The Election Commission has said that it will be decided further after considering all the suggestions received from political parties

 Three such miraculous stories of Ganga's devotion to Mahadev in Kalyug, after seeing that your head will automatically bow down in reverence
 to sabase pehle chalate hai ramgarh
 Here, mother Ganga consecrates Mahadev for 24 hours
 kehete hai, jisane bhi maa ke is rup ke darshan kar liye uski koi bhi muraad baaki nahin rahati
 This is the unique picture of Shiva's power, devotion to Ganga
 kaliyug main bhagwaan kaa ye rup or unka chamatkaar naastik ko bhi aastik bana detaa he
 Mother Ganga consecrates the continent here, that too for 24 hours
 jharkhand ke ramgarh jile ke mahadev mandir main bhakt jab apane aradhy kii puja karne pahunchate hai to ve yahaan isi shraddha ko dekhte hai
 The mother Ganga is seated just above the Shivling in this temple
 inaki naabhi se 24 ghante jal kii dhara bahati he
 In this stream, Shiva keeps getting wet and blesses his devotees
 ye jal kahaan se aata he ye koi nahin jaanata
 Whether it is dry or rainy, winter or summer, the flow of water from the navel of the Ganges never stops
 mahadev ke is anokhe mandir ke pujari raghunatha das ne bataaya ki bhakt ise tuuti jharnaa ke naam se pukaarte hai
 This temple came into existence in 1925, when the British were digging the land to lay the railway line
 khudaai ke dauraan unhen jameen main gumbadnuma kisi cheez kaa ahsaas hua
 This temple came out on a good view
 is baat kaa pataa lagane kii bahut koshish kii gai ki ye jal aata kahaan se he, lekin kamyaabi nahin mili
 And when this distinction could not be revealed, then this question was left forever, considering it a miracle of Mahadev
 mahadev ke ek shraddhalu bablu kehete hai tuuti jharnaa mandir main jo koi bhakt bhagwaan ke is adbhut rup ke darshan kar letaa he uski muraad puri ho jaati he
 There is always a rush of devotees here to see the miraculous form of Shiva and Ganga
 bhakt shivlinga par girane vaale jal ko prasad ke rup main grahan karte hai or ise apane ghar le jaakar rakh lete hai
 It is said that this water contains so many powers that the mind becomes calm with its reception
 dukhon se ladane kii takat mil jaati he
 Now we are going to tell you about another place
 surat main dharti kaa seenaa fadkar maa ganga gangadhar kii puja karti hai
 Surat has a Shivalinga that is fragmented, has countless holes and flows through these holes
 gangadhar ke is rup ko adbhut or durlabh bataaya gaya he
 This form is not seen again and again
 is rup kaa darshan maatr bhakt kii naiya paar laga saktaa he kyonki is rup main sristi ke sanhaarak shiv or jeevandaayini maa ganga ke ek saath darshan hote hai
 You must have heard that Ganga had passed through Shiva's shoes
 mahadev ne ganga ke veg ko tham liya tha
 We tell you the story behind this fragmented Shivling
 gujarat ke surat jile ke olpad main bane siddhanath mandir main sthapit is shivlinga ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ye swayambhu he or saikadon saalon se khandit avasthaa main he
 It is said that robbers tried to loot the Siddhnath Mahadev temple hundreds of years ago
 luteron ko laga ki shivlinga ke neeche khajaana chipa he
 So he hit the Shivling with an ax, which caused holes in it
 kaha jaataa he ki tab mahadev krodhit hokar in chhidron se bhanwaron ke rup main prakat hue or unhone luteron ko maar bhagaaya
 Janaka Bhai Goswami, the priest of the temple, told that the robbers fled but Mahadev had to give a call to Ganga to return the sanctity of the temple
 shiv kii ajna se shivlinga main prakat huyi gupt ganga aaj bhi isamen apni lay main bahati hai
 According to Hindu scriptures, the fragmented Shivalinga should not be worshiped, but not only this miraculous form of Mahadev is worshiped here but also following the law
 puja se pehle mahadev ko shivlinga se nikalne vaale jal se hi snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 Devotees are happy to see this form of Shiva
 ek shraddhalu zankhnaa ben patel kehete hai ki shivlinga main shiv ke aadesh par prakat hue jal ko yahaan aane vaale bhakt ganga jal kii tarah istemaal karte hai
 Now if we do not call it a miracle, what else would you say that while the water around this temple is very saline due to the proximity of the sea, the water coming out of the Shivling is sweet like coconut water
 yahaan aane vaale bhakton ko jahaan mahadev ke darshanon kaa saubhaahgya miltaa he vahiin gangaajal unhen kai tarah kii bimariyon se bhi chhutkaaraa dilaataa he
 The Gupta Ganges also flows into the Galteshwar temple in Vadodara
 yah ganga mahadev ke charan dhoti he
 Devotees call the name of the errant river here in the Ganges
 kehete hai galteshwar mahadev ke charnon kaa sparsh karne ke liye maa ganga yahaan apni raah badal kar aati hai
 Apart from this, both Ganges and Yamuna live in a Shivling with one hundred thousand holes in Chhattisgarh
 bhakton ko yahaan mahadev ke saath-saath maa ganga or yamuna kaa aashirwad bhi miltaa he

 He is very dangerous for just a short time
 jab aap dil se dance ko nahin lete to aap aate hai or teji se chale bhi jate hai
 On reality shows, choreographer Terence Lewis's questionterance said that nowadays i see that the circus is getting more dance less

 On August 15, we are going to tell you about a mother from Bhopal, whose son attained martyrdom 24 years ago while fighting terrorists on 10 December 1994
 bete ke shahid hone ke baad is maa ne haar nahin maani balki apane tarah se bhartiya sena ke liye raashi jamaa kar rahi hai
 In memory of the son of a martyr in Kashmir, his mother, who lives in Bhopal, is depositing the amount received from him by selling pottery and artifacts in the army fund
 ye hai bhopal ke shahpura main rahane vaaleen nirmala sharma
 He was martyred in 1994, Betanirmala's son Devashish was a captain in the Indian Army and was received by Veeragati during an army operation on 10 December 1994
 bete ke shahid hone ke baad nirmala ne faisla kiya ki bhale hi unka betaa is duniya me nahin rahaa, lekin wo uski yaad ko fouj se jode rakhana chaahati thim or isliye unhone mitti ke bartan or kalakritiyon ko banane kii jo kala sikhi thi usase ab aaajeevanabhartiya senake jhanda nidhi ke liye saunp di he
 From 2007, Nirmala makes an earthen pot exhibition in memory of her son and donates the entire proceeds from it to the army flag fund
 nirmala ke mutabik bete ke shahid hone ke turant baad hi wo ye kaam shuru karnaa chaahati thim kyonki unhone mitti ke bartan or kalakritiyon ko bananaa siikhaa tha lekin 1994 main bete ke shahid hone ke baad unke man main sena ke liye kuch karne kaa khyaal aayaa or 2006 main pati ke nidhan ke baad 2007 se nirmala ne ye kaam shuru kiya
 The surgical strike again happened in 1994, although the son died, but despite the martyrdom of the son, Nirmala was not encouraged and he not only praised the surgical strike done by the Indian Army but also expressed the wish that in the future Surgical strikes continue so that those looking at the country with their eyes can get a befitting reply
 nirmala ne abhi tak bhopal samet desh ke kai shaharon main pradarshnee laga kar usase hone vaali kamai ko sena jhanda nidhi main daan kar diya he
 According to him, he is proud of his son's martyrdom and will continue to do as much as he can for the Indian Army as long as he is alive

 On behalf of the prosecution, Special Public Prosecutor Pradeep Gharat tried to prove for five days that the story of the driver of the defense is unfounded
 kyonki iske pehle jab ek gavaah ne kaha tha ki usne gaadi se 4 logon ko utarate dekha tha
 At that time, the defendants did not try to know in the cross examines or prove who the fourth person was
 yahaan tak ki jaanch adhikari kadam kii gavaahi ke dauraan bhi bachaav paksh ne ye to poocha ki kya us raat ashok singh police stesan aayaa tha? lekin ye nahin jaananaa chaha ki kya usne ye bataane kii koshish kii thi ki gaadi wo khud chalaa rahaa tha
 According to Gharat, the first investigating officer Kadam also denied that Ashok Singh had come to the police station
 isaliye ye kahin se sabit nahin hota ki us raat car salmaan khan nahin balki unka dryver ashok singh chalaa rahaa tha

 kya 2017 main nokia or blueberi apane taabut se nikalakar chaa jaaenge? ye donon aisi companiyaan hai jo arsh se farsh tak pahunchi hai or ek baar se inamen jaan foonkane kii kavayad chal rahi he
 We have told about Nokia's plan before, but today let's talk about blackberry
 4 janvari 2017 ko kanjumar electronic sho kii shuruuaat hogi or is dauraan blueberi ke nae divaais pesh kiye jaaenge
 At the moment it is not clear whether it will be a smartphone or something
 lekin li kii is duniya main jaankariyaan li hoti hai aise hi blueberi ke is smartphone kii jaankariyaan bhi li ho rahi hai jise kodenem marakari se develop kiya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, Blackberry has closed its mobile business, but the company has also announced that it will make its smartphone from the TCL company
 dhyaan rakhane vaali baat yah he ki yujar interphes or software blueberi ke hi honge jiske liye yah company jaani jaati rahi he
 Three consecutive Android smartphones are more or less failing, but will the next Android smartphone be able to make a splash? According to reports, the blackberry Mercury or blackberry DTEK 70 have started leaking online
 inaki kuch photose or spacification bhi saamne aae hai
 Not only this, the CEO of the company has recently indicated that he has a smartphone that will have a QWERTY keyboard
 jaahir he QWERTY keyboard or blueberi kaa purana rishta rahaa he
 The CEO of the company has even stated that
 'ek or aa rahaa he or wo shaayad aakhri in house phone hoga'
 It is so clear that Blackberry has also designed it and the software will also belong to the company
 taaja li image bhi pichley se miltaa julata he ki jisamen dual karvd disple dekha ja saktaa he
 Also 4 in it
 5 inch kii disple ke saath capasitive nevigational batan or QWERTY keyboard diya jayega
 According to the reports, the next blackberry smartphone will have Qualcomm Kaletest Snapdragon 821 processor and it is being told that it will be given 32GB of internal memory with 3GB of RAM
 photography ke liye 18 megapixl rier or 8 megapixl selfi camera diya ja saktaa he
 In terms of specification, it should be mid-range, but as Blackberry has been making mistakes with some of the existing smartphones, or rather, users have found fault in their price
 blueberi Priv behtareen smartphone hone ke baavjood apni zyada keemton kii vajah se pit gaya he
 It will be interesting to see whether Blackberry can do anything through this smartphone

 shaayad yahi vajah he ki nadiadwala ne akshay ke saath sulah kar lee he or ab iske tisare bhaag main akshay ko aane ke liye raji kar liya he
 On the other hand, the news is that its director Anees Bazmee has also agreed to direct the third part of the film, as Anees Bazmee was also upset with Nadiadwala
 anis ko shikaayat thi ki nadiadwala ne unka mehtaanaa nahin diya he, jiske liye unhone shikaayat kii thi
 But now there is news that there is a reconciliation between Anees and Feroze as well, that in the third part of this film, the Purani team of the film 'welcome' can come back together
 film 'welcome' ke sikval 'welcome bek' se akshay baahar ho gaye the
 It is said that Akshay had demanded Rs 50 crore from Nadiadwala for the sequel, due to which Feroze made the film 'welcome Back' with John Abraham in place of Akshay
 haalanki, sikval ne bhi 100 karod se zyaada kaa kaarobaar kiya, magar visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki agar film 'welcome back' main akshay hote to iskaa kaarobaar 20 se 30 karod or bad saktaa tha
 Perhaps this is the reason why Nadiadwala has reconciled with Akshay and has now convinced Akshay to come in the third part
 udhar, khabar yah bhi he ki iske nirdeshak film ke tisare bhaag kaa nirdesan karne ke liye anis baazmi bhi taiyaar ho gaye hai, kyonki anis baazmi bhi nadiadwala se khafa the
 Anees complained that Nadiadwala had not paid his wages, for which he had complained
 magar ab khabar he ki anis or firoz main bhi sulah ho chuki he, yani is film ke tisare bhaag main film 'welcome' kii puraani team waapas saath aa sakati he

 - Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) January 16, 2017 lalu ne kaha ki ''suna he priyanka ji or dimpal kaa ek saath gut bana he
 He hoped that if everyone would run against the BJP in the campaign, it would be easy for Akhilesh to return to power
 haalanki lalu ne mulaayam singh ko sabakaa varisht bataaya lekin nishchit rup se lalu kaa akhilesh ke liye mukhar hona mulaayam gut ko pasand nahin aayega
 However, Lalu's sympathy for Akhilesh is well known due to Lalu Yadav's son-in-law Tej Pratap Yadav being in the Akhilesh faction
 netaji kii banaai hui party he
 Netaji will give his blessings to Akhilesh

 hamsab milakar sampradayik takaton ko haraayenge Prior to this, Lalu Yadav reached the Bihar Congress headquarters Sadaqat Ashram in a book release and said that after consulting with Congress President Sonia Gandhi a week ago, he advised to align with Akhilesh Yadav
 lalu ne kaha ki ''haal main sonia ji se baat kii thi or haalchaal poocha tha
 Urged Soniaji that there is no election for Uttar Pradesh, it is election of the country, it will be rehearsal

 iees afasaron main chal rahi tanatani ke bich dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal pichley aath dinon se uparajyapal anil baijal ke daftar main dharne par baithe hai
 The Kejriwal government demands that LG order the IAS officers of Delhi to withdraw the strike
 lekin abhi tak kejariwal kii maang par alji ne koi aashwaasan nahin diya he
 It is believed that today a big decision can be taken in this matter
 bhukh-hadtaal par baithe swasthya mantri satyendra jain kii ravivaar ko achaanak tabiyat bigadane se unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai are still frozen at the Lieutenant Governor's office
 donon ke bich gatirodh khatm karne ke liye ravivaar ko karnataka, pashchim bengal, kerala or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantriyon ne piem narendra modi se hastkshep kii apil kii
 The Chief Minister of these four states extended his support to Kejriwal and said that what is happening in Delhi against an elected government is wrong
 duusari ore centre sarkaar yaa phir alji kii taraf se is maamle main pahal kaa koi sanket nahin diya gaya he
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party now has only option left to end this dharna
 satyendra jain aspataal main bhartee ho chuke hai or gopal raay kii sehat main lagaataar giravat dekhi ja rahi he
 If similar circumstances persist, Kejriwal and Sisodia's health may also be affected
 yahi vajah he ki party koi aisa rasta nikaalane main juty hui he jisase ye dharna bhi khatm ho jaae or uske netaa jeet kaa daawa bhi kar saken
 The top leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party feel that the purpose they sat on the dharna may not have been fulfilled but the way the Chief Ministers of other states supported Kejriwal by holding a press conference in Delhi and the Center was responsible for this stalemate
 Appointed, it strengthened the demands of the Delhi government and sent the right message to the public
 yahi nahin, ravivaar ko pradhanmantri awaas ke gheraav ke liye dilli kii sadakon par jo bheed dikhi, usase bhi party ke hausale buland hai
 Many political parties of the country have supported Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal in this matter
 in sabake bich is samay kejariwal ke awaas par party kii baithak ho rahi he
 In which further strategy will be discussed
 sutron kii maane to party is baithak main dharne ko lekar bada faisla kar sakati he
 If the IAS strike announces the end of the dharna Kejriwal strike, then it will have to go backwards for the party
 aise main kejariwal sarkaar kii ab koshish hogi ki dharne ko khatm karne ke liye aisa rasta apanaaya jaae, jisase bhukh-hadtaal bhi khatm ho jaae or dilli kii janata main kejariwal or unke mantriyon kii chhavi bhi galat na bane
 This is the reason that yesterday when IAS officers made a press conference and announced that they would not go to the routine meetings of ministers of Delhi government till they get the assurance of security, Kejriwal immediately released a video message clearly saying that the officer's family Is like a member of and fully guarantees their safety
 kejariwal kii is apil par abhi tak iees association kii pratikriya nahin ai he lekin agar afasar dilli ke mukhyamantri par bharosa kar apni kathith hadtaal tod dete hai to ye kejariwal ke liye jeet kii tarah hoga
 On the other hand, this case has now gone to the High Court and the initial remarks of the court cannot be said in support of Kejriwal
 bijepi or congress bhi kam se kam dilli main ye maahaul banane main juty hai ki kejariwal ke dharne se dilli kaa vikaas ruk gaya he or kaam thap pad gaye hai
 In such a situation, if the party continues this strike, it may be difficult for the public to respond
 ye bhi vajah he ki ab kejariwal ke saamne is dharne ko jald se jald khatm karne ke alaava vikalp nahin bachaa he
 Writer director Vinita Nandanealok Nathpur was accused of sexual harassment after the # metoo Movement gained momentum
 iske baad alok nath kii patni aashu singh ne vinata par manahani kaa cese kiya tha
 Its hearing went on Friday
 mumbai court ne kaha ki vinata ko kisi bhi platform par bolne kii aazaadee he
 The court rejected the Khichika filed by Alok Nath's wife
 aashu singh ne yachika daakhil kar vinata ke kisi bhi plateform par bayaan dene par roak lagane kii maang kii thi
 After hearing the petition, the court said that Vinata is free to speak on TV, social media, print or any other platform
 court ne unki abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa hawala diya he
 Alok Nath has also given his clarification in this matter
 unhone aaropon ko khaarij kiya tha
 Soon after the allegations, Alok Nath had said, "whatever she (vinata) is speaking is her personal point of view
 main naa is maamle ko sweekaarta hum, naa hi isse manaa karata hum
 People have to talk
 main yahaan apni safai nahin dene ja rahaa hum
 In any such case, only one man is not included
 ve aage is par or baat karenge
 At this time i would like to remain silent
 abhi-abhi is maamle ko padhaa he or ve zyada clear nahin hai
 "what is the whole case? Vinata Nanda has accused Alok Nath of sexual exploitation
 unhone fasebuk par lanbaa chaudaa post likh actor par sangeen aarope lagaae
 "they physically abused me," said Vinata
 main 1994 main tivi ke number van sho 'tara' ko likh rahi thi or iskaa production kar rahi thi
 He was behind my lead girl
 ladki kii unamem koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 During a scene, Alok first came drunk on the set and then fell on Navneet during the shot, after which Navneet slapped him
 ''vinata ne bataaya ki ek baar vah alok nath ke ghar par hui party main shaamil hui
 They left home late around 2 o'clock at night
 drink main kuch mila diya gaya tha
 On the way, the person stopped the car, which was driving itself and said that i should sit in their car, i will leave the house
 main us par bharosa karke gaadi main baith gai
 Nanda said, "after this, more alcohol was poured into my mouth and i was subjected to a lot of violence
 agle din jab dopaher ko main uthi, to main kaaphi dard main thi
 i was not only raped but i was brutally treated by taking me to my home
 " The government hopes to take steps to increase the cash in the economy in the upcoming budget to give a boost to the real estate sector and to achieve the goal of housing for all by 2022
 jameen jaaydaad ke bare main paraamarsh dene or uske vikaas main lagi companiyon ne yah kaha he
 Apart from this, companies have also demanded to give industry status to real estate sector, single arrangement for approval of development of realty projects, tax rebate to house buyers, tax rebate to companies and to make a policy to promote houses on rent
 Has sibiarai ke chairman or siio (bharat, dakshin purv asia, pashchim asia or africa) anshuman magazine ne kaha, ‘modi kii aguwai vaali sarkaar ne pichley kaarykaal main kshetra ko patari par laane ke iraade se kai sudharatmak kadam uthaaye lekin kosh jutaney, puunji or nakadi se judi kai chunautiyaan abhi bhi baadha bani hui he
 He added that with the sector being given industry status, realty companies want a relaxation in external commercial borrowing rules from the government
 prope tiger daat kaam ke siio dhruv agarwal ne kaha ki gaiyr-banking vittiya companiyon main sankat ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar ke hastkshep se kshetra main nakadi baadhaon ko dur karne main madad milegi
 He said, 'we also expect the government to take steps to increase bank funding to the sector so that projects stuck with cash concerns can help
 purvankara ke prabandh nideshak ashish purvankara ne yahi baat kahi or real estate kshetra main taralata evam nakadi samasya dur karne par jor diya
 He also stressed the formulation of National Rental Housing Policy so that by 2022 the target of housing for all can be met
 (input bhashaa se) On Monday, the opposition parties created a ruckus in Parliament on the announcement of the Modi government to remove Section 370 related to Jammu and Kashmir
 isi ke saath 370 par siyaasi golbandi bhi shuru ho gai
 Many parties including the Congress criticized this decision of the Modi government and even bitter opponents like Kejriwal were seen standing in support of the Modi government
 aaie dekhte hai dhara 370 par koun party kis paale main he
 Who supported the resolution to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir: Bahujan Samaj Party - 4 mps Biju Janata Dal - 7 mps AIADMK - 11 mps YSR Congress - 2 mps - Aam Aadmi Party - 3 mps tell that these are parties which are not part of the government , Yet he has announced to support this bill
 in partiyon ke alaava shivasena, akali dal or endie ke anya sadasyon ne is bill kaa khule dil se samarthan kiya he or modi sarkaar ke is kadam ko aitihaasik qaraar diya he
 The Janata Dal Union, which is running the government with the Bharatiya Janata Party in Bihar, walked out of the Rajya Sabha during the discussion
 rajyasabha main jadyu ke 6 saansad hai, lekin vah sadan main sarkaar ke khilaaf vot nahin karenge
 Significantly, the Modi government has recently passed three divorce bills, UAPA bill, motor vehicle bill from the Rajya Sabha, so the government should have no problem in passing this proposal as well
 sadan main NDA ke paas 104 se adhik saansadon kaa samarthan hai, iske alaava vipaksh ke kai saansadon ne beete dinon main apane pad se istipha diya he, aise main bahumat kaa aankada bhi kam hua he
 Former Aam Aadmi Party member Mufti Shamoon Kasami has also jumped into the discord of the Aam Aadmi Party
 kaasmi ne kaha ki jab unhone paardarshita or india against karpshan ko milane vaale chande kaa maamla uthaaya tokejariwal ne unhen team anna se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Kasmi said, 'prashant Bhushan is raising the issues i was raising while staying in Team Anna today
 ' kaasmi ne kaha ki maine baithkon main paardarshita laane or india anguest karpshan ke chande ko public coj research foundation (pisiaref) main daalane kii baat kahi thi, agar usee samay logon ne saath diya hota to 'aap' main taanaashaahee kii samasya naa hoti
 According to 'kasami', even in Team Anna, a few people used to take decisions and the rest of the people had to just seal them
 maine us vakt bhi apana virodh darj karaayaa tha
 That is why Kejriwal could not bear to be in his Anna team
 'unhone kaha, 'shuruyaat main mujhe lag rahaa tha ki 'aap' sabhi dalon ko swatchta or paardarshita kii raajnneeti par chalane ke liye majaboor kar degi magar is party ke maujuuda ghatnakram ne svachh raajnneeti kii chaah rakhane vaale logon ko niraash kar diya he
 ' kamishnar sahab, sachmuchagudiyaase hi khilne kii to umr he uski
 And on April 15, she had crossed the threshold of her home from her little feet to play as inhungudia
 par daravaaje par hi use shaitan mil gaya jo use uthaa kar apane ghar le gaya
 And then the innocent went to nocha-khasota for two whole days
 use kamare main puure do din tak band rakhaa gaya
 During this time the father wandered from one to one in search of his doll
 sochaa kamishnar sahab ne 16 disambar ke baat itani badi-badi baaten kahi hai, ho saktaa he unki police badal gai ho
 Will find my doll
 par afsos, kamishnar sahab
 
 
 His misunderstanding soon cleared up
 kamishnar sahab
 
 
 
 aapaki police ne to taraka diya par bechaara wo baap kaise maanata? laga rahaabeti kii talashmen
 And finally the sound of groaning came from one room under the house, then people reached that room
 andar vahiin gudiya kaid thi
 He was abducted by a neighbor and ran away leaving nocha-khasota and then the injured doll for two days
 do din baad jab gudiya ghar se baahar ai to kya bataaen kis haal main thi, strechar par ek aspataal se duusare aspataal le jaai ja rahi paanch saal kii is gudiya ke jakhmon kii agar puri hakeekat aap jaan jaaen to yakeen maniye aapaki bhi chikhen nikal padengeen
 By the way, sir
 
 
 
 i am not just writing, but really writing, that in writing the account of someone's wounds, never before shook his hand
 kya kahuun uske jakhmon ke bare main
 a heart is also needed to listen
 bas yun samaj lijie ki dusron ko jindagi bakhshane vaale doctoron tak ne jab is bacchee ke jakhmon ko dekha to unke munh se bas yahi niklaa
 
 
 
 
 Can a human do the same with a baby girl like a flower
 17 april ko jab wo gudiya sabase pehle alengepi aspataal main laai gai tab tak uske jism se qataraa-kataraa kar naa jane kitna khun bah chukaa tha
 The poor people had blades all over the body
 jism ke nichle hisse ke uske zyaadaatar anduruni ang jakhmi the
 Three candles and a small vial were lying inside the stomach
 aage auki kya boluun kamishnar sahab
 
 
 
 aap sun nahin paaenge
 Neither will we be able to speak
 haalat aisi thi ki khud doctor kuch kehane kii haalat main nahin the
 There was so much satisfaction for the poor father that the girl at least reached the hands of the doctors
 ilaaj to shuru ho gaya
 But perhaps his hopes were being broken after listening to the doctors' talks
 par kamishnar sahab abhi aapaki jaanbaaj police kii besharmi kaa ek or cheharaa saamne aana baaki tha
 Your police could not find the doll itself, yes, when his story came out, to save his job, his police gave a bribe of two thousand rupees to the doll's father
 chaay-pani ke naam par
 So that he does not tell the story of their inefficiency to anyone
 par aapako to pataa hi he
 By then the doll's story had become common
 maahaul phir 16 disambar jaisaa hone laga tha phir kya tha
 First you came into action and then the government
 gudiya ko fouran alengepi aspataal se behatar ilaaj ke liye ames le jaaya gaya
 Yes yes thik vaise hi jaise hangaame ke baad 16 disambar kii us maasoom ko safadarajang se singapore le jaaya gaya tha
 It may be that doctors' medicine, people's blessings and the spirit of that doll save her life
 lekin agar wo jinda bhi rahi to puri jindagi bas jindagi se yahi shikaayat karti rahegi ki tuune mujhe kis dilli main paidaa kiya jahaan log gudiya tak ko noch daalate hai
 Former captain of the Indian team Mohammad Azharuddin today dismissed the allegations made by Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) President g Vivek, saying that he has written to the BCCI about the latest developments of the HCA
 echsie main yah vivaad tab saamne aayaa jab saat janvari ko vishesh aam baithak (esgm) main ajahar ko nahin jane diya gaya
 In this meeting, the members were to be informed about the recommendations of the Lodha Committee

 This matter became an issue when Prime Minister Narendra Modi teased mention of cemeteries and cremation grounds in Uttar Pradesh elections
 sirf uttar pradesh hi nahin, balki bijepi shashit rajyon main ye maamla garma gaya he
 Especially in Chhattisgarh, the demand for a free Muktidham for all religions on the lines of everybody's development and everyone's support has gained momentum
 dilachasp baat yah he ki isaki maang sattadhari bijepi se hi uth rahi he
 For this, a strong trial has started on making provisions in the budget
 chhattisgarh main sattadhari bijepi or mukhya vipakshi dal congress pradhanmantri modi ke us vaktavy ko lekar sakriy ho gaye hai, jo unhone uttar pradesh chunaav main apane virodhiyon par hamalaa karne ke liye chhedaa tha
 Prime Minister Modi had launched a scathing attack on the Samajwadi Party over the graveyard and crematorium, but now this issue has also gained momentum in BJP ruled states
 isaki shuruyaat chhattisgarh se hui he, jahaan party ke bheetar se hi rajya ke tamaam chote bade gaanv or shahro main ek adad muktidhaam kii maang uth khadi hui he
 That too with the arguments and arguments
 bijepi netaa or party kaarysmiti sadsy ajay shukla ke mutabik iske liye bilkul bajet main prabandh hona chahie, kyoki puure jivan main aadmi kii jo kamai hoti he, wo shanti ke saath antim sanskaar sthal main dikhaai detii he
 bjp's mantra is, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 iske liye hinduon ke shmashaan, muslimon ke liye kabristaan or isai va parsiyon ke liye bhi antim sanskaar sthal achche or viksit hona chaahi, kyonki yah aisi jagah he jahaan sabhi ko janaa he
 Not only BJP, the main opposition party of the state Congress is also demanding to set an annual budget for the maintenance and development of cremation sites for all religions
 congress netaa prabhaat meghawale ne maang kii he ki sarkaar apane salanaa bajet main iskaa praavdhaan kare
 In Chhattisgarh, there is no provision in the budget for the cremation ghats of Hindus, tombs of Muslims and graveyards of Christians, nor is there any such tradition
 vibhaajan ke baad chhattisgarh main vahi niyam-kaayade lagu hai, jo madhya pradesh main prabhaavasheel hai
 Gram panchayats, nagar panchayats, municipalities and municipal corporations in the state issue nocs in selecting only the locations for traditional cremation grounds, cemeteries and graveyards, while their development is conducted by a local social organization or a trust
 chhattisgarh ke gathan hue 17 varsh ho chuke hai, lekin in varsho main jab bhi rajya kii vidhaan sabha main bajet pesh kiya gaya , usame inke rakrakhaav yaa vikaas ke liye koi raashi aavantit nahin kii gayi
 In this case, the state revenue minister Prem Prakash Pandey argues that the state government approves the revenue for the funeral site on demand
 unke mutabik yah vishay sthaneey nikaayon kaa he
 It is the local bodies that outline the maintenance and development of the funeral site
 chhattisgarh main raipur se lekar bastar or sarguja divijan samet rajya kaa aisa koi hissaa nahin he , jahaan shmashaan ghat , kabristaan or greveyard ke liye rajya sarkaar ne koi aarthik sahaayta muhaiyaa karai ho
 The role of the government has been limited to site selection only for these places
 iske liye rajya sarkaar colectoron ke jariye bhoomi aavantit karti he
 Provided that there is no obstruction by the village and nagar panchayats in the village, the municipality and the municipal corporation in the cities for that land
 jaahir he ye nagareey nikaay us jameen ke istemaal ke liye no objection certificate jari karte he
 Thereafter, the cremation grounds are handled by local social and voluntary organizations, Waqf Boards for Muslims and their local dias for Christians according to Hindu religious system
 ye tamaam sansthaae apane str par aarthik rakam jutati he or unka rakrakhaav karti hai
 There has been no such occasion in the social and religious history of the state, when the people have approached the government for the selection or maintenance and expansion of the site of the crematorium] cemetery and graveyard
 phir ek baar modi sarkaar ke naare ke saath chennai kii rahane vaali rajalakshmi mada 15 hajaar kilometre bike chalaakar dilli pahunchin, jahaan unka jabardast swaagat kiya gaya
 During this, BJP workers flocked to welcome him

 His team includes 25 more
 kya bole manoj tiwari?is dauraan bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne rajalakshmi mada kaa swaagat karte hue kaha, 'yah bullate yatra darshaati he ki yuvaaon, mahilaon main desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ko lekar kitna utsaah he
 He said that these people who are showing enthusiasm, this is the largest practical survey in the country
 desh ek baar phir se narendra modi ko apana chaukeedaar banane ke liye nikal padaa he
 Manoj Tiwari said that the survey sample taken by Manda in his journey is the largest and reliable sample in the country
 15 hajaar kilometre kii yatra main teen se chaar lakh logon ne hastakshar karke diya he ki wo modi ko phir se desh kii bagdor saunpane ko taiyaar hai
 Rajalakshmi's bike trip states that daughters from Kashmir to Kanyakumari are also excited to win PM Modi again, because PM Modi has also guaranteed security to the women of the country
 rajalakshmi boleen- phir ek baar modi banenge piemrajalakshmi ne kaha ki unhen yatra main logon kaa bahut sahyog mila or lakhon aise log mili jo narendra modi ko dil se pradhanmantri banane kii chahat rakhte hai
 He said, 'people have assured me that the country will once again give its leadership to Narendra Modi, because the schemes launched by the central government under his leadership are reaching the people
 unke shashan main mahilaayein apane aap ko surakshit mahasoos kar rahi hai
 On the one hand there is a code of conduct in the country, on the other hand, BJP workers took out the yatra with flags
 is dauraan zyaadaatar bike chaalak bina helmet ke najar aae
 However, it was later clarified by the BJP that permission was taken from the Election Commission for this visit

 Trump, a 70-year-old real estate businessman, said that US President Barack Obama should regret his decision to put Hillary in charge of US foreign policy
 republican party kii apni ummidavaari ko sweekaar karte hue apane bhaashan main trump ne kaha, ''maut, tabaahi or kamajori - yahi hillari clinton kii viraasat he

 jilani ne kaha ki is vakt uttar pradesh main kareeb 40 daarul-kaja hai
 Efforts are made to have at least one such court in every district
 ek adaalat par har maheene kam se kam 50 hajaar rupee kharch hote hai
 Now there will be a discussion on raising resources to open darul-kaja in every district
 jilani ne kaha ki cameti kii kai kaaryshaalaaon main nyaayadhishon ne bhi hissaa liya he
 Media is also invited in these, so that they can properly bring matters of Sharia to the public
 in kaaryshaalaaon main mukhya rup se talaak, viraasat samet vibhinn masalon ke samaadhaan ke bare main bataaya jaataa he
 There has been considerable interest in these programs
 baithak main babari masjid ke silsile main supreme court main jo mukademe chal rahe hai, unki pragati par gaur kiya jayega
 Further strategies will be considered
 unhone spasht kiya ki muslim paksh ayodhya vivaad kii sunwaayee main katai der nahin karnaa chahta
 These kinds of things in the media are absolutely wrong
 dilli hoicourt ne guuruuvaar ko dilli vikaas praadhikaran (didie) kii jameen par atikaraman ke liye praadhikaran kii khinchaai kii or kaha ki vah is sthiti ke liye khud jimmedaar he
 The court said that the DDA did not take precautionary measures on this issue
 justise wike shaali ne vasant kunj main ek jhuggi basti ke gharon ko dhahaane ke didie ke faisle ke khilaaf jhuggi nivaasiyon kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue kaha, ‘jis samay pehla atikaraman hua, aapako aihtiyaati karrwai kerani chahie thi
 This is a situation created by you yourself

 The DDA must state in its affidavit whether or not it has surveyed the area to identify eligible residents for rehabilitation

 input language ghotaalon or bhrashtachar se ghiri sarkaar ko desh ke kuch jane−maane udyogpatiyon or duusare kshetron se judi hastiyon ne naseehat di he
 In an open letter written to the government, advising him to improve his work, four important things have been said on which the government should take immediate notice
 khat main kaha gaya he ki desh main har kshetra main kaamkaaz ab dhilaa ho gaya he
 It is the first responsibility of the people in power to uphold the confidence of Indians in themselves and their country
 khat ke mutabik desh ko sabase zyada nuksaan bhrashtachar se pahunch rahaa he jisase yudhstar par turant puri takat ke saath ladaa janaa chahie
 The third thing has been said in the letter that the representatives of the public should understand the difference between protest and obstruction
 gathbandhan ke is daur janata ke numaayindon ko apni zimmedaari samajni chahie
 It has also been said that the benefit of development is not reaching the poor people of the country
 isaki vajah ek paryaavaran se judi chintaaon ko bataaya gaya he jinhen lekar rajya or centre str tak log ek raay nahin hai
 The letter is signed by 14 well-known people, including Azim Premji, Keshav Mahindra, Deepak Parekh and Dr
 bimal jalaan aadi shaamil hai
 The government has given relief to the central employees troubled by inflation
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa mahangaai bhatta 6 fisad badhaakar 51 fisad kar diya gaya he
 This will benefit about 50 lakh central government employees and 38 lakh pensioners
 ek kendriya mantri ne kaha, kendriya mantrimandal kii aaj hui baithak main mahangaai bhatta badhaane kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 This increase will be considered effective from January 1 this year
 mahangaai bhatte main vruddhi se sarkari khajaane par salanaa 5,715
 There will be an additional burden of Rs 90 crore
 sarkari karmchaariyon or pensionbhogiyon ke mahangaai bhatte main vruddhi se unhen ucch mudrasphiti se nipatane main madad milegi
 At present dearness allowance is 45 percent of the basic salary
 isamen 6 fisad vruddhi kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye chathe vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke anuroop he
 This decision will benefit 50 lakh employees and 38 lakh pensioners
 mahangaai bhatta saal main do baar ek janvari or ek july ko sanshodhit kiya jaataa he
 It is noteworthy that Consumer Price Index (industrial Employees) 9 in December
 47 fisad or janvari main 9
 It was 30 percent
 isi ke aadhaar par mahangaai bhatte main sanshodhan kiya jaataa he
 Gross inflation based on wholesale price 8 in the month of February
 31 fisad rahi he jo 5
 
 6 fisad ke saamaanya str se kahin adhik he
 Food inflation also remains above 9 percent
 rajasthan kii bijepi sarkaar ne bakreed ke din shikshan sansthaanon main chhuttiyaan cancil kar pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay jayanti manaane kaa faisla kiya he
 As per the order of the Education Department, all the employees of the State Government College will come to their offices on 25 September
 is din pandit dinadayal ke naam par blad camp yojit kiye jaaenge
 It has been written in the order of the Government of Rajasthan that on 25 September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal will be celebrated in the institutions of the State College Education Commission, in which blood donation camps will be organized
 masalaa yah he ki isi din 25 sitambar ko bakreed bhi he, jisaki chhuttiyaan pehle se ghoshit hai
 It is a gazetted holiday, dating back to pre-independence era
 aise main is din karmchaariyon ke bulaane ko muslim sanghathan sochi-samajhi sajeesh bataa rahe hansbase badi baat he ki bakreed chand dikhne par nirbhar he, yani 24 or 25 sitambar ko kisi ek din bakreed ho saktaa he, jabaki pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kii jayanti 25 sitambar ko he
 In such a situation, why is the letter asked to be present on September 24? For this reason, Muslim organizations are looking at it with suspicion
 duusari ore rajasthan sarkaar kaa kahana he ki blad donneton saamaajik kaam he or pandit dinadayal bade netaa the, aise main isamen kisi ko raajnneeti nahin dekhni chahie
 Muslim organizations have warned to go to court along with agitating on this issue
 pehle bhi shikshan sansthaanon main surya namaskara ko anivaary karne or urdu teacher kaa pad khatm karne ko lekar rajasthan sarkaar vivaadon main rahi he
 a national woman kabaddi and wrestling player Ruby (name changed) from Bihar wants to make a name in the world of sports
 magar apane gaanv main jaateey vidwesh kii vajah se ab use dabang na keval khel chhodane ke liye kah rahe hai, balki unki baat naa maanane par use balaatkaar kii dhamkee bhi di ja rahi he
 Ruby hails from Pandarak village near Mokama, 40 km from Patna
 pichley kuch maheenon se ilaake ke dabang us par khel chhodane ke liye dabaav bana rahe hai
 And for not doing this, he is also being threatened with rape
 rubi yadav samaaj se he or kabddi kii rashtriya str kii khilaadi bhi he
 The same thing is passing exasperating to the upper Bhumihar caste of his village
 isi baat ko lekar rubi ne 2 maheene pehle bhi sthaneey police se sampark kiya tha or dabangon ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai thi
 But the police did not take any action on that complaint
 rubi kaa kahana he ki vah rojaanaa apane gaanv se 25 kilometre dur kabddi kii prectis ke liye jaati he or gaanv ke dabang use dhamkee de rahe hai ki usne agar kabddi khelnaa band nahin kiya to uske saath balaatkaar kiya jayega
 In fact, a few months ago, Ruby defeated a Bhumihar caste girl in a kabaddi tournament and since then she has been harassed by bullies and molested from time to time
 isi silsile main shanivaar ko rubi patna pahunchi or esaspi manu maharaj se milakar shikaayat darj karai
 After registering a complaint with the Patna SSP, Ruby said that because she comes from the Yadav society, people of Bhumihar society are constantly harassing her and pressurizing her to quit kabaddi
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki esaspi manu maharaj ne bhi is baat ko mana ki 2 maheene pehle rubi ne sthaneey police se is baat kii shikaayat kii thi magar us vakt isko lekar baatcheet ke jariye maamle ko rafa dfa kar diya gaya tha
 But despite that the bullies did not stop harassing Ruby
 patna ke esaspi manu maharaj ne kaha ki ab vah turant hi aropiyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi karenge or unki giraftaar sunishchit kii jaaegi
 The political analysis of the first budget of the Bharatiya Janata Party government has two criteria - one is the concept and the other is the way to implement it
 pehali kasuti kii baat karen to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bajet kii taiyaari ke shuru main hi apane vitt mantri or rail mantri ko rajnatik disha de di thi
 It is believed that Modi had clearly stated that populist measures should be avoided
 bematlab kii saugat na banti jaae or nivesh ko aakarshith karne ke liye puraa jor lagaaya jaae
 Experts say that he assured both ministers full political support
 avadharana ke str par pehle din se hi spasht tha ki sarkaar kii aarthik drushti dakshinpanthi hogi
 Then comes the question of modality
 vitt mantri arun jetali ke teen sipahasaalar vaanijya mantri or vitt rajyamantri nirmala sitaraman, bijli mantri piyush goyal or petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan niyamit rup se un muddon par karrwai ke liye charchaa karte rahe jinhen pradhanmantri ne tay kiya tha
 It is another matter that the Prime Minister's list was quite long
 sutron kaa kahana he ki epadi package ke liye dabaav pradhanmantri karyaalay se aana shuru hua tha
 Instructions for goods and service tax (GST) also came from there
 isi tarah modi akshay or svachh urja par ade hue the
 That is why the emphasis is on setting up very large solar power projects in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Ladakh and laying 15,000 km long gas pipeline in Government Private Partnership (PPP)
 in yojanaon ke liye modi kaa sidhaa-sada mantra yah tha ki inase laabhakaari aarthik gatividhiyaan shuru hongi, rojgaar paidaa hoga or chote tathaa majhole udhyamiyon ko phayda hoga
 All thinking was focused on cities and industries in line with rising expectations
 is disha main bajet main bahut kuch kiya gaya he lekin afasarshahi ke shikanje main aate hi is prakriya kii dhar kuch kund pad gai
 For example, if we talk about increasing the FDI limit in defense sector, initially there was a tempting proposal to take it to 100 percent so that technology can fully come to India and qualitative improvement in India's defense industry
 lekin yah prastaav upie ke samay se chali aa rahi jaani-pahachaani bahes main ulajh gaya
 India's control and security risks were being questioned
 samajha jaataa he ki afasarshahi ne kai adnge laga die or aakhirkaar sarkaar ko bhartiya niyantran par jor dete hue 49 pratishat kii seemaa kaa adhik paaramparik vikalp chunanaa padaa
 The result was a slight improvement over the UPA
 upie sarkaar bhi technology transfar kii shart ke saath 49 pratishat epadi kii manjuuri de chuki thi
 Even now these proposals will have to go through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board
 apni kor aarthik team na hone kii vajah se jetali ko sarkari afasaron par nirbhar rahanaa padaa jinamein se zyaadaatar upie ke samay se hi chale aa rahe hai
 Sources said that this seems to be the most important reason to sabotage any attempt to bring revolutionary change
 pichhali taarikh se tex vasuulne kaa mudda bhi ek aisi misaal he jahaan shuru main rajnatik iraadaa use puri tarah khatm karne kaa tha
 But this intention got entangled in the tussle between the government officials of North Block and the tax control lawyers dug out the old notes and rained the same arguments
 asli jhagada yah tha ki jab kai desh puraani taarikh se tex lagane ke apane adhikaar kaa sahaara lete hai to kya bharat sarkaar ko yah adhikaar chhod dena chahie? agar iskaa jawaab yah he ki sarkaar bhale hi istemaal na kare lekin adhikaar to apane haath main rakhana chahie, aise main puraane maamalon ko band karne kaa sawaal apane aap ulajh jaataa he
 As a result, the bureaucratic solution to form a committee in such cases emerged and the Finance Minister was forced to explain how this is a step in the right direction
 sutron kaa kahana he ki bajet bhaashan kii lambaai se bhi is par afasarshahi kii chhap saaf jhalak jaati he
 The speech was so long that Jaitley got back cramps and had to make an unusual request to interrupt the speech
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ko paanch minute ke liye kaarywahi rokani padi
 During this time the ruling party asked for permission that the Finance Minister should sit down and complete his speech
 phir bhi ve baichaiyn rahe
 He was relieved when he sat on the back instead of following the advice of the Foreign Minister and bowing down
 pi
 Chidambaram used to read every single word of his speech for several days
 lekin samaj jaataa he ki jetali ne is kaamkaaj ko dusron ko saunpane kii style apanaai he
 It also has its benefits
 lekin unke haath main itnaa lanbaa or vistrut bhaashan thama diya gaya jise padhgaye main do ghante se adhik samay laga
 It was probably the longest speech in the last few years
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee vitt mantri rahete hue lambey-lambey bajet bhaashan apni marji se dete the
 However Arun Jaitley in his budget speech has broken the tradition of resorting to poets and poets
 vidambnaa yah he ki jis bajet ko puri team ke liye sarkaar kii niti kaa disha parivartak dastavej bananaa tha, vah is tark main ulajhakar rah gaya ki yah sirf saat maheene kaa bajet he or isiilie shaayad sarkaar dirghakaalik upayon kii ghoshnaa nahin kar pai
 As a result, the sign of intention seems favorable, yet for the future, everyone is compelled to say, "go ahead and find out
" ”rajnatik morche par is bajet se yahi pushti hui ki modi sarkaar apane janadesh kii vishwasaneeyata na ganvaane ke prati puri tarah sajag he or isiilie baari ummiido ke dabaav main kshamta se zyada vaada na karne kii pravriti najar aati he
 The flip side is that there is not much ambition
 satta main aane ke pehle saal main 7-8 pratishat vruddhi dar kaa lakshya sochaa-samaj to lagata he lekin josh jagaane main kuch khaas kaamyaab nahin hota
 According to sources present in the government, the government intends to continue to take such steps along with the budget, which will change the sentiments of investors
 iske liye pranaaliyon or prakriyaaon main sudhaar kiya jayega
 For example, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion is working on relaxing the rules
 abhi niyam yah he ki 100 se adhik karmchaariyon vaale udyogon ko kisi kii chantni yaa talabandi se pehle sarkaar kii anumati lenaa jaruri he 
 It is now being talked about to impose this condition on industries with 1,000 or more employees
 isi tarah nae udyog shuru karne waalon ke liye ek i-plateform viksit kiya ja rahaa he taaki ve ek jagah aavedan karen or unke prastaav ko vahiin se sweekruti ke liye sambhddha vibhaagon ko bheja jaae
 This entire process can be monitored within a certain time
 in sabhi upayon kaa bharpoor rajnatik laabh us samay mil saktaa he jab in par asardaar dhang se amal kiya jaae
 Now all attention will have to be paid to this
 modi ko afasarshahi par kade niyantran ke saath kaam karne kii apni aadat ke saath-saath lagaataar rajnatik takat bhi dikhaani hogi
 If this does not happen, good intentions and effective messages will also be lost in the maze of arguments and complexities
 jeenyu deshadroh ke maamle main cese chalaane ke chargeshit ko dilli sarkaar ne ab tak anumati nahin di he
 The government had to give permission by Tuesday
