 The proposal to send it to the Select Committee fell during voting

 Congress has never compromised on terrorism, so it brought the bill
 lekin aapane do baar aatankwaad se samjhauta kiya he pehle rubia said ko chhudwane main phir masood ajahar ko choda gaya

 chidambaram ne kaha agar koi is bill main main sanshodhan dekhen to ise NIA ko or shakti dene kii baat kahi jaati he lekin ab is rup main paas kar rahe hai ki ab kisi ko bhi aatankwaad ghoshit kiya ja sakegaa isliye ham is bill kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 P
 chidambaram ne kaha, '2008 main jab main grahamantri tha to maine kaha tha ki aatankwaad khilaaf teen pairon par khadaa hoga
 First NIA, second NATGRID and third NTC
 lekin ab hamaare paas sirf ek pair he
 Where are NATGRID and NCTC '
 makapa ke ilamaaram kareem ne kaha ki ‘‘sarkari aatankwaad'' thopa ja rahaa he or asahmati jataane waalon ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 "this will cause widespread oppression and injustice
" '' unhone kaha ki is sanshodhan se rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ko kisi bhi rajya sarkaar kii anumati liye bina yaa use suchit kiye bina us rajya main jane tathaa kisi vyakti ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa khulaa license mil jayega
 Home Minister Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha: Chidambaram ji asked why to name an individual as a terrorist when the organization they are affiliated to is already banned
 It is because we ban one org, another one comes up by same individuals
 Till when will we keep banning orgs? # uapapic
 twitter
 com / 0inu9k8zzx Manoj Kumar Jha of RJD said that it is very easy to call anyone a terrorist but it should be seen how the person's life and his family face the situation after that
 sanshodhan vidheyak ke praavdhaanon ko kathor bataate hue jha ne kaha ki yah vidheyak us vichaardhaara kaa sanket karata he ki ‘‘agar main sarkaar kii aalochana karata hum to main rashtravirohi kahalaayuungaa
 '' Digvijaya Singh in Rajya Sabha on # uapabill: We doubt their (BJP) intentions

 Jha said that if the person caught on charges of being a terrorist proves innocent after 15-16 years and is released, then the question arises as to how to return his 15-16 years
 p Chidambaram in Rajya Sabha: In 2008 when i took over as Home Minister, i said anti-terrorism will stand on three legs- one is NIA, one is NATGRID and one is NCTC
 We have only one leg today, what have you done about NATGRID and NCTC? Why are they in limbo? https: / / t
 co / 9r85xdb8vbisake baad charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue grahamantri amit shah ne kaha, 'chidambaram ji kii aapatti he ki kisi vyakti vishesh ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kyon kiya jaae jab us uske sanghathan ko bain kiya ja chukaa ho
 Actually, when we ban an organization, it comes by forming an organization by some other name
 ham kab tak sanghathanon ko bain karte rahenge'
 Amit Shah further said that Digvijay Singh ji seems angry
 haal hi main vah chunaav haare hai
 No one has been convicted in the three cases of the NIA
 kyonki yah sabhi aarope raajnneetik pratishodh ke chalate lagaae gaye the or aatankwaad ko kisi dharm vishesh se jodne kii koshish thi

 Many primitive tribal families in Gumla, Jharkhand have converted to Christianity
 vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ne maang kii he ki is maamle main mishnariyon kii bhoomika kii jaanch kii jaae
 Administrative sources gave this information on Monday
 unhone bataaya ki ghaghara or visunpur block main 100 se zyada pariwaron ne dharm parivartan kiya he
 However, the local media has reported the number of families converting to more than 300
 jharkhand ke nau aadim adivasee samudaayon main se ek, asur kii sankhya teji se ghat rahi he
 The converting villagers say that they have taken this decision for the education of their children
 ilaake ke gaanv sadak, bijli, vidhyalay or swasthya kendron jaisi buniyadi suvidhaon se vanchit hai
 Gumla's administration has said that it will investigate the case
 gumla ke upayukta dinesh chandra mishra ne phone par kaha, 'beete hafte dharm parivartan ke kuch maamalon kii jaankaree mili, jabaki dharm parivartan ke kuch maamle puraane bhi hai
 We will examine both of them to reveal the truth
 ' He said, "only after investigation, it will be known whether conversion has been done at will or some kind of greed has been given for it
" ' vihip ne kaha ki maamle main mishnariyon kii bhoomika kii jaanch honi chahie
 The comments vihip ke bihar or jharkhand ke dharm prasar pramukh pramod mishra ne kaha, 'isai mishnariyon kii bhoomika kii jaanch honi chahie
 The primitive tribal community of the state already suffering from declining population has been Christianized under a deliberate plan

 Meanwhile, a video of Congress MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Vadding is going viral, which has been disputed
 is viral video main amarinder singh raja vading panchayat chunaav ke liye prachaar karte hue najar aa rahe hai
 During this time they are saying that our government is there, anything can be done, nomination papers can be done from here, the government has big ways
 darasal, raja vading sarpanch chunaav ke sambandh main bathinda ke ek gaanv main do ummidavaaron ke saath logon se baatcheet kar rahe the
 He said, 'the government has big ways to get their papers from here and there but both candidates are my own
 'punjab ke vitt mantri manpreet badal kaa naam lete hue raja vading ne kaha ki unke or manpreet singh badal ke bich ye baat hui he ki aap donon ummidavaaron ko chunaav na ladvaya jaae, isse donon kaa nuksaan hoga
 Now we have a government and the government can decide anything

 Opposition parties, who have already been accused of rigging and irregularities due to pressure from the government in the panchayat elections, also got a sitting opportunity to attack the Congress government of Punjab after this video went viral
 akali dal or aam aadmi party ne kaha ki wo to pehle se hi kai baar ye baat kah chuke hai ki satta kaa durupyog karke congress virdohi ummidavaaron or vipakshi partiyon ke majboot ummidavaaron ke namakan jaan-boojhkar radd karvaa rahi hai taaki aasaani se panchayat chunaav jite ja sake
 Both parties say that Captain Amarinder Singh and the Congress are aware that the people are very traumatized due to their nearly two years of rule in Punjab, that is why misuse of the government machinery is being tried to win unilaterally in these panchayat elections
 is
 punjab sarkaar ne viral hue video ko lekar apane vidhayak kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki video main unki baton kaa galat matlab nikaala gaya he
 He meant that earlier this would have happened when there was a akali-bjp government in Punjab but there would be no such bungling in our government and the nomination of any candidate would not be canceled in this way

 Imams played a key role in reducing the demonstrations during the recent unrest in the Kashmir Valley
 june main virodh pradarshnon kaa silsilaa shuru hone par ghati kii lagbhag har masjid ek tarah se reliyon kaa centre ban gai thi, jahaan yuva ladke ikatthe hokar laudspikaron se bhadakaau bhaashan dete the
 According to a senior state intelligence official, "initially, boys in the age group of 12 to 15 years used to gather in mosques and shout slogans
" ’’ unhone bataaya ki iske baad jaise-jaise nagarikon kii mauton kaa silsilaa shuru hua, algaavvaadi tatv bhi sangathit hokar, yuvaaon or bujurgon se apil karne lage ki ve virodh-pradarshnon main bhaag len
 According to the official, this was the time when the state officials decided to talk to the Imams in this matter
 unase yah sunishchit karne ke liye kaha gaya ki masjidon se naare lagane kaa silsilaa khatm ho
 Subsequently, many Imams recognized that mosques were being misused to serve 'political purposes' and played an important role in convincing the local people that this process should stop
 shahar ke ek imam najir ahamed ne kaha, ‘‘kashmir main nagarikon kii hatyaon jaisi jo ghatnaayen ho raheen hai, unase ham sahamat nahin hai lekin masjiden pavitra sthaan hoti hai or unki pavitrataa ko muslimon ko maananaa hi chahie
 He said that most of the youth who came to perform in his mosque did not attend Namaz
 imam ne kaha, ‘‘maine jyadatiyon or nirdosho kii hatyaon ke khilaaf apane ilaake main hone vaale kai shantipurna pradarshnon main hissaa liya, lekin main patharav yaa laudspikaron ke istemaal ke paksh main nahin hum
 According to another imam of the city, many locals urged him to ensure that the mosque demonstrations ended
 rajya prashasan kai kshetron main imaamon kii madad letaa rahaa he
 Earlier in 2006, the Jammu and Kashmir AIDS Control Society also sought the help of Imams in the state to remove the disease

 The 10 seats won by the Left parties CPI and CPM can be called their worst performance in the last thirty years

 CPI and CPM had only 20 seats in 2009
 sipiem ke garh pashchim bengal main isaki maujuudagi dahaai ke aankade tak bhi nahin pahunch pai
 In this election also it won only 10 seats
 pichley 25 saal main vamapanthiyon ne puure bharat main apni jameen teji se khoi he
 Where it had a presence in 9 states in 1989, today the electoral victory has been reduced to three states

 Ramachandran Pillai explains the reason behind the shrinking ground of the Left parties in West Bengal
 ve maanate hai ki rajya netritv ne kai prashasnic or rajnatik galtiyaan kin
 Pillai, who is going to become party general secretary in place of Prakash Karat next year, says, "we failed to capture the mood of the public
" kaaphi samay tak satta main rahane kii vajah se kuch netaaon main akad aa gai thi
 "but Pillai, who is over seventy, rejects the idea that he is too old for this position
" unke grih rajya kerala main sipii or sipiem kaa vam loktantric morcha (ldf) 2004 main 15 siton ke mukaable ab simatakar chah siton par aa gaya he
 But Pillai considers it a temporary setback
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ham kerala main sarkaar banane se maamuli antar se chook gaye the par ham jald vaapasi karenge
 It is also being criticized that apart from its stronghold two states, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Odisha and Assam, it has been eliminated because these parties have neglected the issues and problems related to the region
 vampanthi netaa bhi maanate hai ki ve jaateey samikarnon ke prati samvedansheel nahin rahe
 In North India, where caste politics is dominated, it was replaced by parties like SP, BSP and RJD
 maharashtra main shivasena or assam main agypi jaisi kshetreey partiyon ne bhi vamapanthiyon ko haashie par dhakel diya
 Political observers believe that the Left had little success in 2004, after a disappointing 1999 performance
 par ab ye partiyaan apraasangik or vilupt hone ke kagaar par hai
 Aditya Nigam of Delhi's Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) believes that a new leftist party has emerged in the form of AAP, attracting an idealistic group of youth
 nigam kehete hai, ‘‘aaj ke vampanthi dal mulaayam singh yadav ke samaajawaadee party kii tarah hai
 There is no socialism anywhere in the party other than the name
 ’’ avasar ko bhaanpakar aam aadmi party (aap) ne kerala ke purv mukhyanmantri ve
 s
 achyutanandan samet kai varisht netaaon ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uske binar par ladgaye kaa nyauta bheja tha
 Former CPM member Prasenjit Bose says, "he has been replaced by AAP leaders
 aakhir karaat or seetaram yechuri jaise netaa kejariwal kii tarah chunaav kyon nahin ladate?’’ ve kehete hai ki chaar baar tripura ke mukhyamantri rah chuke maanik sarkaar ko party main badi bhoomika milani chahie
 Pillai clarifies in response to the attack that not contesting the election of senior leaders is the result of our division of work, "a lot of time is needed to focus on the constituency
" sanghathanaatmak kaary ek purnakalik daayitv he
 If Karat contests the election, who will run the party? ”pillai also does not believe that the failure of the AAP is the failure of the Left
 unke mutabik, ‘‘aap kii koi vichaardhaara yaa kisi mudde par spasht raay nahin he
 It is trying to pull those who were defeated by the system
 aisi raajnneeti zyada nahin chalati
 Bose believes that the party should change with the changing times and instead of issuing press releases should use modern methods of connecting with voters
 pillai bhi isse sahamat hai lekin ve paryaapt sthaan na dene ke liye media ko bhi doshi maanate hai
 His question is, "modi, Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal's rallies got adequate coverage but why are our rallies ignored?" More needs to be done

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Friday warned the voters of the state that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP, which had formed the government thrice with the help of BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and once again with the help of the BJP, once again took similar plans

 duusare lafzon main kahen, to puri duniya main unase bad kar gairinsaani harakatein koi or kar hi nahin saktaa
 But there are many places in the same world, in spite of these non-human antics, the craze for the world's most dreaded terrorist organization, ISIS, is increasing
 ye kahani he aisi hi ek deewangi kii, jisamen yaman ke chote-chote bachche apane hi jaise duusare bacchon ke saath sir kalam karne kaa khaufnak khel, khel rahe hai

 All of these children are bare-bodied and have their hands tied behind them, while the terrorists have held their victims in the neck as other terrorists usually do before punishing someone
 ab sabake sab qatari main us thikaane kii taraf badhate hai, jahaan ravaayat ke mutabik logon ke bich in bacchon kaa sir kalam karne kaa drama kiya janaa he
 Growing up, all terror-turned children bow down once and then pick up something like a knife placed in the ground to behead
 yani manjar thik vaisaa hi he, jaisaa iesas ke kisi camp main logon ko sajaa-e-maut die jane ke vakt hota he
 Dusk is turning, and the children of terrorists, one by one, order all their victims to sit on their knees, and all the children of the victims do exactly the same as the helpless and innocent people of the terrorists
 ab baari he, sir kalam kiye jane kii, lekin yahaan bhi sir kalam karne ke drame se pehle jehadi jon kii tarah aatankwaadi bana ek baccha apni baton ke saath camere se mukhaatib hota he
 And during this entire game, the sound of something spoken in Arabic is heard in the background

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has now come down to political audacity in Kerala
 party khuleam hindutv ke mad main jhum rahi he
 In a state where 27 per cent of Muslims and 18 per cent of Christians live, this politics may seem unwise and impractical, then what will be gained from it? With Amit Shah's capable electoral tactics, the party is actually targeting the rest of the population - it is 55 per cent of the Hindu population
 bijepi apana kayantaran ek aise vishaal hindu rath ke rup main kar lenaa chaahati he jis par pichhadi jati ke ejhava, savarna namboodri or anusuchit jati ke pulayaa, teenon ko baithaaya ja sake
 The unity of Hindus here is nothing more than confusion on the social level, but the question arises whether it can be turned into a political reality
 yahaan aise kai malayalam hindu hai jinhone aadhuniktaa kii jhonk main samyawad se prerana lekar apane jatinaamon ko tilanjali de di he, baavjood iske is samaaj main ab bhi jatigat chetana badastoor kaayam he

 This claim may seem ambitious for a party that won just 6 percent of the votes in the 2011 election and did not get a single seat
 bijepi kii nigaah aam chunaav main hasil 10
 The unprecedented 3% votes cast in Aruvikkar's by-election held in June is based on 17% of the votes he contested from the CPM

 The BJP has made a detailed plan for voters under which the list of voters and caste and religion in each ward has been prepared

 The bjp's target is voters who can possibly vote for him and then the party will campaign to substantiate these possibilities

 The Mumbai police has been accused of repeatedly that she unnecessarily picks people up, beats them and makes a spectacle of them
 kuch maheene pehle isi mumbai police par premi jodon ko bhi jabardastee tang karne ke iljaam lage
 Later, the then police commissioner also had to apologize
 haalanki lagata he ki mumbai police sudharne ko taiyaar nahin
 At least this is what the picture recently revealed
 ek police stesan ke andar aadhi raat ke drame kii ye wo tasviir he jiske saamne aane ke baad ab police ko jawaab dete nahin ban rahaa
 Despite the midnight hour, there is a crowded crowd at Andheri police station in Mumbai
 thane main duusare fariyaadiyon ke saath-saath ek kapal bhi maujuud he, jinase police ke log alag-alag poochtacha kar rahe hai
 During this interrogation, the girl intermittently apologizes to the policemen and pleads to be let go
 wo kahati he ki ainda wo idhar nahin aegi, chupchaap ye yahaan se chali jaaegi lekin ladki kii fariyaad pulisavaalon par koi asar nahin karti
 The questioning continues and then both begin to reveal their respective identities
 bataate hai ki wo tech mahindra main kaam karte hai or train lekar ghar jane vaale hai lekin pulisavaale donon kii nahin sunate
 Rather, a woman policeman starts reprimanding her girl when she answers, and sometimes jerks her hand over showing an I-card, sometimes the officer being questioned pushes the girl, including the chair
 cheekhti rahi ladki lekin nahin rukii policeladki kii fariyaad in pulisavaalon ko kuch itani zyada nagavaar guzarati he wo achaanak hi donon par tut padate hai
 The police actually want to lock the boy in lockup
 or yaheen se shuru hota he ladki ke cheekhney-chillane or police ke marpet karne kaa barbar silsilaa
 Suddenly, the girl's voice becomes even louder and she is abused by this assault
 gaali sun kar pulisavaalon kapaara saatven aasmaan parja pahunchataa he phir wo donon ki aisi dhunaai karte he ki use dekhnaa bhi mushkil he
 The lady and the gents break up on both policemen simultaneously
 ab ladki apane bachaav ke aakhri hathiyaar ke taur par ye bataati he ki uski maa parliament main kaam karti he
 On not leaving them, she will talk to all the policemen, but at the boon of the girl, the policemen start ridiculing her
 hansane lagate hai lekin donon ko peetane or khinchne kaa silsilaa chalata rahata he
 And then the girl starts crying
 had to tab ho jaati he, jab pulisavaalon kii pitayee se ladki ke munh se khun aane lagata he
 After all, what was their fault? While beating the police like this, they take the boy and forcefully lock him in lockup, while the girl is dragged away and taken away
 ab ladki phir se apni maa ke parliament main kaam karne kii baat kehete hue unhen phone karne kii baat kehane lagati he
 But the policemen still laugh at him
 ab to ek pulisavaala to yahaan tak kahata he ki agar uski maa parliament main kaam karti he, to uskaa baap parliament main ministar he
 The question is, what is the fault of this couple of 20-22 years of age? After all, why is the police not willing to let them go despite all the pleas and requests? And finally they are beaten up in the police station and locked in lockup
 vardi ke rob main police ne jis jode ko aadhi raat ko thane main buree tarah peeta, uskaa jurm bas itnaa tha ki donon chalate-chalate thane ke baahar sadak kinare kisi baat par bahes karne lage
 That too just a verbal debate
 koi marpet nahin naa hi koi hangaamaa yaa tamaasha
 Now these policemen will tell what is the crime in the street wrangling? Actually, this couple working in a call center were returning home after completing their duties on Monday evening but on the way between the two There was discord about the matter
 abhi donon andheri thane se thodi dur metro stesan ke get paas khadey ho kar kahasuni kar hi rahi the ki duty par tainaat do constablon ne unhen gher liya or hangaamaa karne ke jurm main thane chalane ko kehane lage
 Both of them refused to go to the police station and said to go home quietly but the police stopped
 wo jabaran donon ko thane le ai or iske baad jo kuch hua, wo ab sabake saamne he
 According to the videotapes of the incident recorded in the robbery, the police were preparing to implicate them in a false trial that night after beating both of them, but the member of an NGO who went to the police station for some work secretly took this whole incident Shooted on a mobile phone and when the policemen threatened to do the same, the policemen changed their intention to file an FIR against both
 apane bachaav main pulisavaalon ne jo daleel pesh kii, wo bhi kam chaunkaane vaala nahin tha
 The police said off camera that both had drunk liquor that night and were brought to the police station in the middle of committing drunkenness on the road at midnight
 haalanki hawalat main band ladkaa baad main bhi pulisavaalon se hi shikaayat karata ki unke saath bevajaah marpet kii gai
 Seeing in the pleas of the police that they have not embraced, at least it does not seem that both have drunk alcohol and are making a ruckus by drinking alcohol, but if you go to the pictures, then where the boy is sitting quietly in his place, The girl is apologizing again and again and requesting them to leave
 jaahir he, agar donon ne sharaab pi thi, to police unki medical jaanch karvaa sakati thi lekin is tarah marpet karne kii kya jarurat thi? philhal is sawaal kaa police ke paas koi jawaab nahin he
 It is another matter that after the questions of the media, the top police officers have now set up a DCP level inquiry in this case

 haalanki tab bhi donon deshon ke bich ke sambandh dabe-chupe hi rahe

 These two arguments behind the distance from Israel are said to be in reconciliation with Israel
 pehla yah ki is yahudee desh se kareebi arab deshon se bharat ke sambandhon main tanaav kii ashanka, doosraa desh kii muslim aabaadi kii naaraazgi
 In fact, relations between Israel and Arab countries surrounded by Muslim nations have always been bitter

 isroyal or philistin ke bich varshon se chale rahe aa rahe takaraav ke bich bharat sarkaar kii yahi koshish rahi he ki use kisi ek kaa himachati na samajha jaae
 In such a situation, where many strategic benefits are being counted by PM Modi's lonely Israeli visit, there is also a possibility of some loss
 sabase pehla to yah ki bharat apni urja jaruraton ke liye ab bhi khadi deshon par buhat zyada nirbhar he
 In such a situation, if Arab countries are upset with India's friendship with Israel, India may have to face its consequences

 India has been standing in favor of Palestine India It is worth noting that in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, India has always stood in favor of Palestine
 bharat ne isroyal ke gathan ke prastaav kaa bhi virodh kiya tha
 At the same time, in the atmosphere of tension between India and Pakistan, the Arab countries also never took the open interest of Pakistan nor took any intervention in the Kashmir dispute

 In such a situation, bypassing the Palestine Intefada (mass movement) by India in this way, there is a fear that the Arab countries can also avoid standing in favor of India in the event of such disputes

 The formula given by the Congress was not liked by the Patidars, after which the Congress leaders had to have a separate meeting
 haalanki baithak ke baad patidaar netaaon ne kaha ki unki mulaakaat behad achche maahaul main hui
 Congress has given 2 to 3 options, which will be decided first after discussing with Hardik and later with the society, whether to support Congress or not

 Andhra Pradesh Governor ESL Narasimhan, Chief Minister n Kiran Kumar Reddy and Deputy Chief Minister c Damodar Rajanarasimhan have also mourned the demise of the senior TDP leader
 aaazaad bharat ke ab tak ke itihaas main film or raajnneeti kaa dilachasp rishta rahaa he
 Especially without film stars, the political history of South India cannot be imagined
 dakshin ke rajyon main aadha darjan se bhi zyada aise netaa hai jinhone raajnneeti main sheersh mukaam hasil kiya
 Also reached the peak of the party
 haalanki shesh bharat main ye ekadam ulat he
 It is not that film stars outside the south in the country did not achieve a place in politics
 vinod khanna, shatrughna sinha jaise netaa bhi raajnneeti ke shikhar par dekhe gaye
 But history also tells that the film stars were resorted to to defeat the popular and local leaders in the rest of India
 bharat ke purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi bhi kuch aisa hi maanate hai
 Vajpayee, who opposed the entry of film stars into politics, had said, "actors were resorted to to defeat political leaders
 " haalanki koi abhinayta raajnneeti ke maidan main vaajapeyi ko kabhi pachhad nahin paaya
 While Atalji's political career, representing the Lucknow parliamentary seat, saw two big occasions when he had a fight with the movie stars in the elections
 jab indira ne atal kii raily flop karne ke liye TV par chalavaai thi bobi!1996 se lekar 2004 tak pradhanmantri pad ke liye atal ji ko cheharaa banaakar hi bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav ladaa or ullekhneey safalataa hasil kii
 In 1996, Vajpayee managed to bring the party to power as the largest party / coalition, but his 13-day government could not win the vote of confidence
 unki sarkaar giri, baad main echdi devgauda or indra kumaar gujral ne congress kaa samarthan lekar sanyukt morcha kii sarkaar kaa netritv kiya
 However, despite changing the Prime Minister, the United Front government too could not complete its tenure
 vaajapeyi ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karenus vakt pradhanmantri pad ke liye samooche desh se sirf ek hi aawaaj uth rahi thi
 It seemed that if a vote is sought for the Prime Minister in the whole country, then there is no one to challenge Vajpayee
 darasal, desh ke har kone se har aadmi- vaajapeyi ji ko pradhanmantri ke pad par dekhnaa chaah rahaa tha
 Vajpayee looked invincible before the election
 bijepi ko apni safalataa ke liye uttar pradesh se badi ummiden thi
 It was also natural to happen
 ram mandir andolan or vaajapeyi kii vajah se pichley kuch saalon main uttar pradesh hi aisa rajya banakar saamne aayaa tha jahaan se bijepi ke sarvaadhik saansad chunakar aate the
 At that time, following the tradition of the Congress, the Samajwadi Party, Congress and BSP prepared a big game plan at their own level to stop Vajpayee and BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 bataane kii jarurat nahin ki upi ke sabase lokapriy or kaddavar ranneetikaar or netaaon main gine jane vaale hemavathi nandan bahuguna ko haraane ke liye congress ne bollywood ke sabase bade mahanayake amitabh bachchan ko chunavi maidan main utaara tha
 Due to Amitabh, a popular leader had to face a humiliating defeat in the election
 aage chalakar ye haar unke raajnneetik ant kii vajah bana or bhartiya raajnneeti main lokapriy netaaon kii jameen darkaane ke liye filmi sitare ek hathiyaar bane
 Tired by Vajpayee's popularity, the opposition planned a similar plan several years later in UP
 yojana thi ki kyon na vaajapeyi ke khilaaf majboot ummidavaar utarkar lakhanu sansadeey seat par hi gher liya jaae
 In the event of this happening, Vajpayee will be stuck in Lucknow most of the time to ensure his victory
 or agar chunaav haar gaye to vaajapeyi ke saath bijepi kaa gubbaaraa foot jayega
 When Atal told Lata - i will not pray for your hospital, in 1998 the Samajwadi Party fielded filmmaker Muzaffar Ali against Vajpayee as its candidate in Lucknow
 lakhanu ke liye mujffar ek sthaneey umidavaar jaise the
 He had a lot of domestic connections in the parliamentary constituency, and he was the glamorous face of films
 'umrao jaan' or 'gaman' jaisi charchit film banane vaale kavi, saamaajik kaaryakarta or film nirmaataa mujffar ke maidan main aa jane se lakhanu par sabaki najar thi
 Many film stars also came out in support of Muzaffar
 lekin vaajapeyi ko apane lakhanu par bharosa tha
 He joined the election campaign like he used to be
 itihaas khud ko doharaa paane main naakaamayaab hua
 Vajpayee could not be besieged
 bataane kii jarurat nahin ki apane andaaj ke liye mashhoor lakhanu ne vaajapeyi kii keemat par kisi or ko tavajjo dena pasand nahin kiya
 Muzaffar lost by a huge margin
 upi main bhi bijepi ko aitihaasik siten milin
 Vajpayee became Prime Minister
 chah saal baad 2004 main raaj babbar ko maidan main utarkar samaajawaadee party ne ek baar phir aisi hi yojana banaai thi
 This time, before the elections, the opposition was also looking a bit heavy
 congress ne soft hindutv cheharaa ke taur par mahashur dow
 Karan Singh was fielded against Vajpayee
 vahiin basapa ne brahman chehre ke rup main satish chandra mishra ko maidan main utaara
 But this time also the people of Lucknow considered it appropriate to trust their most loved leader
 majboot ranneeti, filmi sitare or taqatvar ummidavaaron kii maujuudagi ke baavjood vaajapeyi shandaar tareeke se vijay shri hasil karne main kaamyaab hue
 So Vajpayee, who called Rekha to fight Amitabh, kept trying to defeat Vajpayee through film stars
 ek intervyuu main vaajapeyi ne khud kaha tha ki amitabh ko bhi unke khilaaf chunaav ladaane kii khabar thi
 Vajpayee had said, "if i had contested from Delhi, i might have had Amitabh candidates against me
 " vaajapeyi se poocha gaya, phir amitabh se kaise muqabla karte aap? vaajapeyi ne jawaab diya, "main abhinaytaon kaa saamana to kar nahin saktaa
 i had to beg Rekha
 " vaise vaajapeyi filmi sitaron ke raajnneeti main aane kii khilaafat karte aae hai
 But under his leadership, many small and big actors from the BJP like Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha reached Parliament
 vinod khanna or shatrughna sinha to unki cabinet main mantri bhi bane
 The Meteorological Department has issued a Red Warning in view of the possibility of heavy rains in Bihar and Sikkim

 Nandini Sardesai, a member of the Board of the Revising Committee, said, "ram Rahim's film in Dera Sacha Sauda is full of controversies

 Summer falls in the month of June every year but it is a year of record breaking
 rajdhani dilli ke palam ilaake main ravivaar dopaher paara 47 degree ke paar pahunch gaya
 The scorching heat in Delhi thus broke the record of 62 years
 jaipur main paara 46 degree ke paar rahaa, jabaki churu main 47
 6 ° c and the temperature in Pali reached 50 °

 The mercury has reached beyond 46 degrees
 rajya ke baaki jilon main bhi surat devtaa kaa tej barkaraar he
 Records are also constantly being broken in Madhya Pradesh
 bhopal main 48 saal kaa record tut gaya
 Many districts are affected by heat
 bihar main bhi garmi logon par haaavee he
 From the top, electricity is missing from the houses, which is being understood by them
 kuch logon kaa sahaara to park bana he
 According to experts, the temperature in every state is 4 to 6 degree Celsius above normal
 maidan to maidan ab to garmi pahaado par bhi bad gai he
 According to the Meteorological Department, temperatures in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are also reaching 2 to 3 degree Celsius above normal
 agle kuch dinon tak haal aisa hi rahenge
 If the delay in the monsoon increases, the damage will increase
 Every person who is suffering from heat is feeling right here
 Why is June finally boiling after the cold May? The answer is hidden in this question itself
 may kaa maheenaa aamtaur par saal kaa sabase garam maheenaa hota he
 In the month of May, due to the heat, a low pressure area is formed on the Indian subcontinent, in the language of meteorology, it is called 'heat low'
 is 'hit lo' yani may kii garmi se monsoon kii hawaaon ko takat milti he jo teji se bharat kii taraf badhati hai or may khatm hote-hote kerala main jhamajham barish dena shuru kar detii hai
 But this time neither there was much heat in May nor monsoon caught pace
 kerala main monsoon 1 june ke bajaae 6 june ko pahunchaa
 Hot winds coming from Pakistan, due to the weak monsoon, the warm westerly winds from Pakistan caught pace and engulfed the entire northwest India including Rajasthan
 aise main june kii shuruyaat main hi paara teji se upar chadhana shuru ho gaya
 This situation still persists and due to this, people are having to suffer from severe heat
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki pachua hawaaon kii raftaar main lagaam tabhi lag sakati he jab monsoon dobaaraa teji pakade or uttar bharat main nam hawaaen pahunch kar jhamajham barish karen
 On the other hand, light rain in Kerala has increased the 'thirst' of the people of the whole country, especially North India
 sabake man main yahi sawaal he ki aag ugalate suraj kii garmi se kab milegi raahat? lekin sachai yah he ki monsoon kerala ke tateey ilaake se aage nahin bad rahi he
 Experts say that the onset of monsoon is not right, so fear has started growing
 amuman monsoon ke dastak ke baad kerala ke tateey ilaakon main baari barish hoti he, lekin is baar mahaj 1 semi se lekar 4 semi tak hi barish hui he
 What is the reason behind the low rainfall According to the information, El Niño, which is being formed in the Pacific Ocean, is behind the possibility of the monsoon rain being weak
 darasal, duniyabar kaa mausam samandar ke pani or vayumandal ke bich hone vaale melmilaap kaa nateeja he
 According to meteorologists, India's monsoon is the result of winds from the equator running thousands of kilometers away
 jab yahaan prashanth mahaasaagar kii sataha kaa taapmaana saamaanya se zyada hota he to is sthiti ko latin main al nino kehete hai
 El Nino is more likely to be seen on the monsoon
 aise main monsoon kii deree se shuruyaat or uske baad raftaar par lagaam laganaa achche dinon ke sanket to katai nahin maane ja sakate hai
 Therefore, meteorologists are keeping a close eye on every single change happening in the Arabian Sea

 If you also have to take something on this auspicious occasion, then know that this time the price of gold and silver has increased by about 3 thousand rupees compared to last year
 is saal sarrapha bazaar main pichley saal kii tulana main zyada mahangaai he
 If we talk in the figures, then the price of gold directly increased by three thousand rupees per 10 grams, while silver also became expensive by Rs 3500 per kg
 haalanki alag-alag shaharon main inke daamon main kuch fark he
 Know in which market is the price of gold in Ratdilli is Rs 29,100 per 10 grams
 ye 22 carat shuddhta vaale sone kii keemat he
 In Delhi, the price of 24 carat gold is Rs 31,123 per 10 grams
 mumbai main sone kaa bhav dilli se thodaa zyada he
 It is Rs 29,600 per 10 grams for 22 carats
 24 carat kii prati 10 gaam keemat 31,658 rupee he
 22 carat gold in Kolkata is priced at Rs 29,310 per 10 grams
 haalanki chennai main ye in shaharon kii tulana main sasta he
 In Chennai, 10 grams (22 carat) gold is available at a rate of Rs 28,590
 kolkata main 24 carat sone kii keemat prati 10 gram 31,348 rupee he to chennai main yah30,578 rupee ke rate par mil rahaa he
 The silver rate is Rs 42,500 per kilogram
 agar dhanteras par lenaa chaahate hai sone-chaandi ke sikkeaj ke din sone-chaandi ke sikkon kii kharidari khub hoti he
 If you have to take a gold coin, its rate is about Rs 16,436 per 5 grams
 vahiin 10 gram ke sone ke sikke kaa rate kareeb 33 hajaar rupee padegaa
 The price of such 20 gram coin is close to 65 thousand rupees
 bataa den ki ye rate sarkari sanstha mmatisi ke hai or isamen waite or duusare tex nahin jode gaye hai
 At the same time, if you want to take silver coins, then the value of 10 grams of the coin will be about 550 rupees and the silver coin of 20 grams will be about 1100 rupees
 apane liye kharidne ke saath aap ise kisi ko shagun yaa gift ke taur par bhi de sakate hai
 Beware of copying, identify such gold is pure or if you buy gold and silver on adulterated Dhanteras, then at the same time it is adulterated and cheating
 isse bachane ke liye aise karen asli sone kii parakh-1
 While buying gold, apply a small scratch on the gold with the help of a pin and then put a drop of nitric acid on it
 nakli sona turant hi haraa ho jayega
 2
 sone kii shuddhta jaanchane ke liye water test karen
 Take a cup of water and dip the gold in it, if the gold is immersed in a cup of water, it is real
 3
 Rub the gold on the ceramic plate or ceramic plate
 If the golden line is formed then your gold is correct
 4
 In India, a BIS institution checks the quality level being provided to consumers, so one should buy gold only after seeing the BIS hallmark
 aise pahachaanen sone kii sahi keemtasona kharidte samay ise 24 carat ke bhav se kharida jaataa he, jabaki sone ke gahane 22 carat ke kharide jate, jisaki keemat bahut kam hoti he
 So whenever you buy gold, divide 24 by the price of 24 carat gold and multiply it by 22, this will give you the price of 22 carat gold
 asli chaandi kii pahchaan aise karensone se zyada chaandi main milawat kii jaati he isliye isaki kharid par bhi dhyaan rakhana jaruri he
 When buying silver, rub it with a stone if the streak appears white then the silver is pure
 yadi yah lakeer pile rang kii he to isamen tamba, jasta or aluminium kii milawat he

 yogi adityanath ke raaj main uttar pradesh kii sarkari imaaraton ke bhagavakaran ke baad ab taj mahotsav par bhi soobe kii sattadhari party ke agenda kii chhap dikhaai degi
 The theme of the annual Taj Mahotsav being held for the first time in Yogi Raj has been changed
 taj mahotsav is baar bhagwaan ram ke naam par yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 The Taj Mahotsav, which has been held every year for two and a half decades, always has a glimpse of the Mughal period, but this time it will not happen
 philhal, upi main bijepi kii satta he or soobe kii kaman yogi adityanath ke haathon main he
 In such a situation, instead of Mughal style, a dance drama based on Ram will begin the Taj Mahotsav
 ye he taiyaarihar saal kii tarah is baar bhi taj mahotsav 18 farvari se shuru hokar 27 farvari tak chalegaa, jisaki rangath is baar ekadam alag hogi
 The festival will begin with the presentation of Sri Ram Kala Kendra, where Lord Rama's pastimes will be staged in front of the public through a dance drama
 ho chukaa he vivadaupi sarkaar kii paryaton sthalon kii bocolate main tajmahal kaa naam na hone par kaaphi vivaad hua tha, jiske baad meerut kii saradhana seat se bijepi vidhayak sangeet som ne kaha tha in logon ne hindustan main hinduon kaa sarvanaash kiya tha or ab bhaajapa sarkaar babar, akbar or aurangzeb kii kalank katha ko itihaas se baahar nikaalane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Apart from this, there has also been a dispute about the Namaz in the Taj Mahal
 kuch sanghathanon ne yahaan namaaj ke saath puja kii bhi maang uthaai
 Also, some people associated with the Hinduist organization went to the Taj campus and recited Hanuman Chalisa
 madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main mangalvaar ko hui do mahilaon kii pitayee ke maamle ne tool pakad liya he
 On this issue, there was a lot of uproar in the MP Assembly as well as the Rajya Sabha on this issue
 ab madhya pradesh sarkaar main grahamantri bhupendra singh ne puure maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 mp's Home Minister said - Buffalo meat was not meat of cow but Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said on Wednesday that in the report of meat from women in Mandsaur, Buffalo meat has been confirmed but it is forbidden to be taken in the state so both women Has been sent to jail grih mantri ke is bayaan ke baad maamla mayawati ne is maamle ko rajyasabha main uthaaya or doshiyon par kadi karrwai kii maang kii
 Women were beaten up on the platform
 On Tuesday evening, at the Mandsaur railway station, the activists of Hindu Dal caught and smashed the two women on the platform on suspicion of smuggling beef
 maukey par police bhi thi lekin hindu dal ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki bhi ek naa suni
 The women of the Hindu party had beaten both women fiercely
 jiske baad police donon mahilaon ko pakad kar pehle thane laai or phir court main pesh kiya jahaan se donon mahilaon ko jail bhej diya gaya tha
 The political atmosphere was heated only after the video of the beating showed the beatings at Mandsaur railway station, as the MP assembly and Parliament session is going on, there was a fierce rhetoric on this matter from the state to the national level
 mayawati ne jaise hi ye mudda rajyasabha main uthaaya to hangaamaa ho gaya
 The Congress and other opposition parties supported Mayawati on the issue
 jaanch ke aadesh die gaemaamle ne jab tool pakadaa to rajya ke grahamantri ne jaanch ke aadesh de die
 The Home Minister said that while waiting for the complaint of the women who were beaten, they have ordered an inquiry
 doshiyon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 But the big question is that when the police showed such agility in catching the women who were carrying meat, why the police could not catch the people captured in the beating video so far

 1
 notebandi par janamat sangrahaupi kaa chunaav bijepi ke liye isliye jeetna isliye jaruri he kyonki upi ke janadesh ko log notebandi ke faisle par janata kii raay ke rup main lenge
 The success of the recent local body elections was promoted by the BJP as support for demonetisation
 lekin desh ke sabase bade rajya upi kaa chunaav pehla bada chunaav chunaav hoga jahaan notebandi ke faisle kii pariksha hogi
 In this, if BJP wins, then demonetisation will be propagated as green signal of the public, but if bjp's performance is not good in separate elections, then opposition parties will get the basis to say that the people voted against demonetisation
 2

 agar bijepi desh ke sabase bade rajya main satta kabjane main safal rahati he to is modi sarkaar kii nitiyon kii jeet maani jaaegi

 There are many such bills which are passed by Lok Sabha and get stuck in Rajya Sabha
 tab bijepi ko vipakshi dalon ko saath lenaa padataa he
 The Rajya Sabha has the highest number of 30 seats from UP
 aise main sabase bade rajya upi main jitkar bijepi rajyasabha kaa sameekaran bhi badalanaa chaahegi taaki apni nitiyon ko lagu karne main use sahuuliyat ho sake
 4
 raashtrapati chunaav kii chunauti25 july 2017 se pehle raashtrapati kaa bhi chunaav hona he
 To win in this, UP victory is very important for BJP
 raashtrapati ke chunaav main upi kii kaaphi ahmiyat rahati he
 There are 403 mlas, 30 Rajya Sabha members and 100 seats of the Legislative Council
 raashtrapati chunaav main upi ke mahatv kaa isi se pataa lagata he
 Being in power at the Center, if the BJP does not win its candidate in the presidential election, it will become a battle of prestige for it
 isliye bhi upi kii jeet uske liye jaruri he
 5
 jiesti lagu karne ke liye rajyon main sarkaar jaruri1 july se guds and services tex yani jiesti lagu hona he
 This will be a major change in the country's economic system
 isamen rajyon kii kaaphi bhoomika hogi

 lekin kya mahaj yah adarsh sthiti ulatpher ke liye paryaapt hai yah 18 disambar ko hi pataa chalegaa

 zyaadaatar chunavi surveykshanon ne kaante kii takkar kii baat kehete hue bijepi ko majboot sthiti main bataaya he
 At the same time, in the survey of observations, BJP is seen crossing the figure of 92 seats
 electronic voting mashin (iviem) bhi chunaavon ke dauraan badnaam ho rahi he or is badanaami ko rokane main chunaav ayog kii sabhi koshishen bhi kargar sabit hoti nahin dikh raheen hai
 This time evms have VVPAT (facility to give voter receipt) information to the voter that his vote has gone to the party for which he had pressed the button
 iske baavjood iviem gadabadi ke kai maamle darj hone ke saath chunaav ayog kah rahaa he ki istemaal ho rahe 24 hajaar iviem main kuch ko gadabad honge hi
 Voting has been held in South Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch areas
 dakshin gujarat kaa surat ilaaka pehle patel aarakshan andolan or phir notebandi or jiesti se pareshaan kaarobaariyon ke virodh ke kendra main rahaa he
 Surat is the hub of textile polish of the country along with being the center of textile business in the state
 is kshetra ke kaarobaari lambey samay se bijepi kaa samarthan karte rahe hai lekin is baar inkaa virodh congress kii kismat chamakane kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 At the same time, the Patel reservation movement can also play a very important role in reversing the results because Surat is also a strong stronghold of the Patels
 surat ke baad saurashtra doosraa ahm kshetra he jahaan donon partiyaan bada ulatpher karne kaa daawa kar rahi hai
 Patel voters are also dominant in this area and 12 Patels have lost their lives during the movement
 lihaaja is kshetra main patel aarakshan andolan behad aakraamak or hinsa se bharaa hua rahaa he
 In this region, the Patels have claimed to teach the BJP government a lesson by holding them responsible for the death of the agitators
 haalanki kuch report daawa karti hai ki ek bade tabake ko bijepi manaane main kaamyaab hui he lihaaja congress ke paksh main kisi bade ulatpher kii sambhaavna kam he
 However, the fact that the Congress has done something unexpected in this field also cannot be denied
 vahiin kuccha jaise registani ilaake main bijepi ko samarthan do ahm kaarnon se jari rahane kii ummid he
 The achievements of the BJP government in reconstruction after the 2001 earthquake among the current voters is a big reason
 vahiin is kshetra main narmada kaa pani pahunchane se bhi pradhanmantri modi se votaron kii ummid badi he
 Voters believe that in the coming days, due to the efforts of Prime Minister Modi, tourism in the region can get a big boost
 jahaan gujarat chunaavon ke liye prachaar kii shuruyaat congress ke vikaas pagalaa gaya or bijepi ke main vikaas hum ke naare se hui lekin isse donon partiyon ke bich mahaj tikhi bahes dekhne ko mili or votaron par koi khaas asar nahin padaa
 At the same time, the shock of communalism is the second issue in elections in which both parties are playing their respective roles
 ayodhya se lekar pakistan kaa mudda chunaavon main garm rahaa he
 However, no one, including the Congress, has raised the Godhra incident of 2002 in the elections
 jahaan congress or bijepi iviem mashiinon main jang jeetne kii koshish main hai vahiin ek gaanv aisa bhi he jisane puri chunavi prakriya kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 After the boycott, no major party has even tried to ask for votes in this village
 is gaanv main bijli, pani sadak jaisi moolbhoot aavashyaktaaon kaa abhi bhi intjaar he
 All 1,065 voters in the village have vowed not to go to the polling booth in the hope that the winning party will take notice of their opposition and take necessary steps for them as soon as possible
 is gaanv ko vikaas ke mudde par ho rahe chunaav ke vakt bhi vikaas kaa intjaar he
 Bollywood actor Sunil Shetty said on Sunday that he was impressed by Chief Minister Narendra Modi's focus on the development of the state due to the development of Gujarat

 ' hotel kaa inkaar, police ne sil kar jaanch ke liye bheja samplasef ne kaha- vah meet hard ho saktaa lekin bif nahinlakhanu ke gomtinagar ke ek bade restaurant main guuruuvaar ko hangaamaa ho gaya
 a family who came to eat there, accused the restaurant that they had ordered mutton but they were served beef
 vahiin restaurant ke logon kaa kahana he ki jab is parivaar ko matan kaa ek bada tukdaa parosa gaya to ise bif kehete hue hangaamaa kar diya
 Forensic investigation teams, the case has increased so much that the police was fully informed about this
 soochna milte hi police ne restaurant pahunch kar maamle ko sangyaan main liya
 After which the police called the forensic investigation team
 forensik jaanch team ne meet ke sample ko sil kar diya or jaanch ke liye bhej diya
 According to information, the family alleged that the family of Gomti Nagar had gone to eat food in a big restaurant in the Mall of Gomti Nagar, Lucknow
 is dauraan unhonematon ke gosht kaa ordradia
 The family says that mutton meat was served and after eating it came to know that it was beef
 unka kahana he ki bif main badi si haddi milane ke baad unhone restaurant manager se isaki shikaayat kii lekin vah nahin maane
 However, the police and the investigation team were called after this
 maukey par pahunchi police ne food sample ko check kiya or use sil kar diya
 Also sent the sample forward for investigation
 vahiin restaurant shef kaa kahana he, 'un logon ne bif nahin parosa
 He guarantees 110% of this
 matan kii jagah yah hard yani ki bade bakre kaa ho saktaa he par wo bif nahin he
 'the police is investigating the case, the victim Aarushi Verma said,' We came here to eat because i had given a party here
 lekin hamen jaise hi meet parosa gaya hamaare papa ko pataa chal gaya ki isamen koi badi kami he kyonki unhen idia tha or mujhe idia nahin tha
 There was such a big bone in it, which we were surprised to see
 ham chaahate hai ki in logon ke khilaaf ection ho kyonki ham to yahaan kha chuke hai lekin aane vaale logon ko is baat kaa sangyaan ho
 Police is currently investigating the entire case
 ' The MCD toll on DND has become a major danger for those going from Noida to Delhi
 sabuh se lekar raat tak koi aisa vakt nahin jab logon ko emsidi toll kii vajah se trephic jam kaa saamana na karnaa padataa ho
 When the 'aajtak' team arrived at different times for the last five days to take stock of the MCD toll, the crowd of trucks stopped at the toll greatly upset the car drivers
 south emsidi ne manamaani karte hue commercial vaahanon se tex vasuulne ke liye bich sadak par toll booth bana rakhaa he
 DND toll free was a good news for those going from Delhi to Noida and from Noida to Delhi
 trephic jamki badhati samasya ko dekhte hue hi 26 oktober 2016 ko DND toll ko tex free kar diya gaya tha, lekin noida se dilli jane vaale logon ke liye yah khushi zyada din tak barkaraar nahin rahi
 The MCD toll booth welcomes people with heavy traffic jams as soon as the outskirts of Delhi begin at a short distance from the free DND toll
 emsidi toll se guzarane vaale trakon ko bich sadak par hi roak liya jaataa he
 The way toll workers stop trucks becomes a problem for small vehicles passing around
 bich sadak par toll-booth karmchaariyon kii fouj jab trakon ko achaanak rokatii he, to peeche teji se aa rahi gadiyon se takkar kaa khatra kaaphi bad jaataa he
 Toll workers at MCD toll booths also use sticks to stop trucks, which also instills fear in people traveling in taxis passing through here
 darasal, noida se dilli jane vaali sadak par 4 len hai, jahaan emsidi ne sadak kii ek len main toll booth banaaya he
 While tax is charged from trucks in 2 lanes
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki raat ke vakt toll booth par na to raushnee ke paryaapt intjaam hai or na hi toll booth par sisitivi camere lagaae gaye hai
 Incomplete arrangements at the toll booths run by the South MCD also raise many questions
 aaiye ab shaam ke vakt dendi par lagane vaale trephic jam kii tasviir bhi dekh lijie
 After morning, noon and evening, when the team of 'aaj Tak' reached dnd's MCD toll booth at 1 o'clock in the night, quite astonishing pictures were captured in the camera
 toll booth par karmchaariyon ke saath baithe dilli police ke jawan camera dekhte hi gaayab ho gaye
 Sitting on a table and a chair in the middle road, two Delhi Policemen enjoying the sweet mango are absent on seeing the camera
 news camere se peechha chhudaane kaa alam yah rahaa ki teble par apana helmet bhul chuke ek police ke sipaahi ne helmet lene ke liye bhi toll karmchaaree ko bheja
 Now the question arises as to why the soldiers of Delhi Police rush from the toll booths in a hurry? The question also arises whether the Delhi Police is ignoring the traffic jam around the toll booths? This question is because when traffic jam occurs, then the traffic police personnel appear to be missing from the spot
 DND par sadak ke bichobich bane tex collection booth se aa rahi samasya ke bare main 'ajtak' ne south emsidi kii netaa sadan shikha raay se jab sawaal poocha to jawaab behad taalane vaala tha
 They say that if the toll is to be taken, then the booth will remain
 agar logon ko samasya aa rahi he, to ham is par vichaar karenge or dekhenge ki koi riplacement point mil jaae
 The South MCD is currently talking to the mayor and commissioner to find a solution to the problem, but the claims seem hollow
 rashtriya janata dal ne aarope lagaaya he ki 1000 karod se bhi zyada ke srijan mahaghotaale kii sibiai jaanch main ab tak keval choti machhliyon par hi karrwai kii ja rahi he or unke khilaaf praathmiki darj ho rahi he
 RJD believes that the strings of this Mahaghotale are connected with the big leaders of the ruling party, but even then the CBI is not taking any strong action against these leaders
 srijan mahaghotaaleki sibiai jaanch par sawaal uthaate hue argedy pravaktaa shakti singh yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi is puure ghotaale main sidhe taur se shaamil hai or in donon ke satta main asin rahete hue is maha ghotaale kii nishpaksh jaanch kabhi sambhav nahin he
 On behalf of the RJD it was said that despite being in the cognizance of the Bihar government, the government did not pay attention to this entire scam, instead robbing the state exchequer by giving loot
 rashtriya janata dalsupremeo lalu prasad yadav or unke parivaar waalon ke khilaaf sibiai tatparta se jaanch kar rahi he, isko lekar shakti singh yadav ne kaha ki vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ke khilaaf jaanch main sibiai hameshaa tatparta dikhaati he, lekin bhaajapa shasit pradesh main gadabadiyon kii jaanch main sibiai shithilataa dikhaati he or iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan madhyapradesh kaa vyapam ghotaalaa he
 RJD said that if the CBI is used to protect its people and allies of the alliance, then the credibility of this institution is certain to be discounted
 shakti singh yadav ne kaha ki bhagalpur ke srijan mahaghotaale kii jaanch ko dabaaya gaya he or har prakaar ke dhyanakarshan ko nakaarte hue srijan maamle se akut sampatti dhan sangrah karne kii chhot di gai
 The RJD has demanded that the CBI investigate the entire case impartially and also file an FIR against the accused by making them named accused soon

 isse cancer, kidney kii beemaari, bacchon main otism jaisi samasya dikhi he
 This attempt to find the cause among the growing graph of the disease is to warn those in the family who are unknowingly using something that has made one of their own sick
