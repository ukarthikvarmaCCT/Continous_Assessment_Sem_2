 a sensational twist has taken place in the Anil Ambani murder plot
 is maamle ke ek gavaah bharat bhorge kii rahasyamay halaat main maut ho gai he
 Bhorge's body was found on Tuesday near a railway station in Mumbai
 bhorge ek mechanic the
 He was the first to see pebbles and stones in Ambani's helicopter
 ye kankad ingine ko kharaab kar sakate the or helicopter krash ho saktaa tha
 It is believed that it may be a conspiracy to kill Anil Ambani
 bharat kaa shav local train se kati hui haalat main mila he
 Meanwhile, Mumbai Police, which is investigating the case of chopper sabotage, has now sought an opinion from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and experts on this issue so that the results of the investigation can be confirmed
 adhikariyon ne helicopter ke gear box main mili saat pattharon ko bhi ferensik science laboratory (ennesail) jaanch ke liye bheja he taaki inke prakaar or banaavat kaa pataa lag sake
 Virender Sehwag and the fast bowlers who returned to form, will take on the field to avenge the embarrassing defeat of the league stage in the final of the tri-day one-day cricket series and win their second consecutive title on Sri Lankan soil
 bharat or srilanka isse pehle june main asia cap ke final main aamane saamne the jisamen mahendra singh dheni kii team khitaab jeetne main safal rahi thi
 For India, reaching the title match in the tri-series has not been as easy as the Asia Cup while Sri Lanka have not had much trouble reaching the final
 bharat ne karo yaa maro ke mukaable main newjiland ko 105 ran se haraakar final main jagah banaayi thi
 The controversial Nobel to Sooraj Randiv's Virender Sehwag during the tri-series also had an impact on the cricketer relations between India and Sri Lanka
 ab jabaki donon timen aamane saamne hai tab donon ek duusare ko patkhni dene main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 It will be difficult to say anything about what will be the result of the match as most of the sky is clouded here and batting later has not been easy
 aise main tas ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 a 105-run win against New Zealand seems to indicate that the Indian team is in a formidable form but the story is the opposite
 sahvaag ko chhodkar koi bhi anya bhartiya ballebaaj abhi tak acha pradarshan nahin kar paaya jo team ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 In the press conference before and after the match, a literal battle was fought, but the Sri Lankan side has been heavy on India so far
 tisara perera ne apane karier main pehali baar paanch wicket lekar bhartiya team ko gend shesh rahane ke lihaaj se ab tak kii sabase karaari haar dilvaayi thi
 Although India made a good comeback against New Zealand in a do or die match, their batting weaknesses were also revealed in this match
 visheshkar yuva ballebaaj apekshaaon par khara utarane main asafal rahe
 In the absence of Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir, players like Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina had a lot of responsibility but so far they have failed
 sahvaag kii behtareen paariyaan har samay bharat ko sankat se nahin ubaar sakati he or ab jaruri he ki yuvaraj singh sareekhe ballebaaj apane anubhav kaa istemaal karke acha pradarshan karen
 However it will not be easy in front of Sri Lankan disciplined bowling which has found another strong bowler in the form of Perera
 unke alaava lecith maalinga or angelo maithyuj jaise vishwasaneey gendbaaj bhi srilankai team main hai jisase bharatiyon ke liye ran jutanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 India's tycoon also rests on the fast bowling trinity of Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra and Ishant Sharma
 jis tarah se unhone pichley match main newjiland ke sheersh kii bakhiya udhedi thi yadi usee tarah kaa pradarshan final main bhi karne main safal rahe to phir bhartiya team kii balle balle ho jaaegi
 Team: India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Dinesh Karthik, r Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Abhimanyu Mithun, Ashish Nehra, Among Pragyan Ojha, Saurabh Tiwari and Munaf Patel

 Congress President Shahul Gandhi has targeted Modi government on this issue

 The party has also appealed to all its workers to reach there

 Police had barricaded here on the up-delhi border, where a heated debate took place between the farmer and the police
 is dauraan police ne unhen rokane ke liye pani kii bauchhaarein kii or aansu gas ke gole chode
 However, after the lathicharge-clash, efforts were made by the government to convince the farmers

 The government should have talked to the farmers on the very first day of the peasant movement

 According to Tyagi, the way the government has implemented the Swaminathan Commission half-way and is not satisfied with the other steps taken for the farmers

 India will have to work hard to maintain the run in powerplays and death overs
 bharat ne pehle match main aakhri chah wicket 26 ran ke bheetar ganvaaye
 As far as bowling is concerned, just like in the first match, India will depend on the spinners

 The 8-year-old leopard escaped from the cage into the forest on Sunday night from Banaragatta National Park in Bangalore
 chidyaghar or van vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii 6 timen use talash rahi hai
 The tendu was caught on the 7th of this month from a school in Whitefield, Bangalore, after 12 hours of hard work
 is dauraan van vibhaag ke ek adhikari samet chaar karmi ghayal hue the
 The next day, some people claimed to see 2 leopards in the area late in the evening
 afratfari machi to agle din is ilaake ke 130 skool ehtiyaat ke taur par band karvaa die gaye
 However, both of those leopards did not come under the control of the forest department
 kai jagahon par pinjre bhi lagaae gaye lekin sabhi koshish bekaar gayi
 Now he has escaped from Leopard Zoo which was caught from this school
 chidyaghar ke kaaryakari nideshak santosh kumaar ke mutabik aisa lagata he ki raat main khaanaa dete vaqt pinjre kaa daravaaza sahi se band nahin hua or wo bhaag khadaa hua
 Santosh Kumar says that this tenduah is not a man-eater, so people do not have to worry
 vahiin karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharamaiya ne un logon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kaa aadesh diya jinaki laaparvaahee se ye tendua bhaag niklaa
 At the same time, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah ordered to take strict action against those people, due to whose negligence this leopard escaped
 aam taur par log bihar ko rajnatik, aitihaasik or saanskrithik centre ke rup main jaanate hai
 Hardly anyone talks about his natural hue
 haa, yah sahi he ki bihar kaa jangalon vaala zyaadaatar ilaaka 2000 main rajya ke bantwaare ke baad jharkhand main chalaa gaya tha
 The natural heritage of Bihar is so rich that water is available only at a depth of 30 feet and in most cases there is no need for boring from the machine
 bihar ke logon kaa prakruti se lagaav saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 Apart from the shady trees of Banyan and Peepal, fruit trees can be seen everywhere
 par durbhaagya kii baat he ki is rajya kii prakritik viraasat ko sahi tarah se pesh nahin kiya gaya he
 Yes, it is a fact that Bodhgaya, Nalanda University (rajgir), Vaishali or other historical places attract more people, while the forests around Valmiki Nagar in West Champaran are not noticed
 haalanki ye jangal baagh jaise kai durlabh jaanwaron kii panaahagaah hai
 Wildlife is also flourishing in Bihar
 dolphin or magaramchh bhi yahaan ke vanyajiwan kaa hissaa hai, lekin unki taraf shaayad hi kisi sailaani kaa dhyaan jaataa ho
 If you are a nature lover, it is impossible to ignore Bihar
 yahaan valmiki tiger rigerv, kakolat jal prapaat, or baraabar gupha ke darshan karne ke baad aap apane anubhav ko jaldi nahin bhul paaenge
 a friend of mine from Kerala said about Bihar, "every inch of the land of Bihar has been used by people or nature very well
 " kudarat ne bihar par khule haathon se apni saugat lutaai he jo uttar main himalay kii talahati se lekar kuch mile dur dakshin main ganga nadi tak faili hui he
 The Ganges flows across the state from west to east
 bihar main ganga kaa maidani ilaaka atyant upjau he
 The lush fields and lush gardens are enough to give a glimpse of the natural splendor of this state
 har taraf hariyaali or upjau jameen is rajya kii prakritik sundarataa main chaar chand laga detii he
 Next time you plan to visit Bodh Gaya, after Makhdumpur market, turn towards equal caves
 ye sabase puraani chattani gufaaen hai jo maury samrajya ke kaal se judi maani jaati hai
 Known for their bird's eye view, these caves surprise the visitors
 yahaan kaa shant or pradooshan se puri tarah mukt maahaul man ko ajeeb-si shanti or taazgi pradaan karata he
 These caves are located in a mountainous area of jehanabad, 75 km from the capital Patna
 agar is jagah ke prati aapaki dilchaspee bad jaati he to aap pattharon par samraat ashok ke samay ke abhilekh bhi gaur se dekhne lagenge
 These caves are located on Parva (four caves) and Nagarjuni (three caves) mountains
 baraabar kii zyaadaatar gufaaon main do kothriyaan yaa chembar hai, jo grenite se bani hai
 They have a very high level of polish on the inner surface and produce very exciting echoes
 agar jangal, jharne or gufaaon ke darshan se aapkaa man na bharaa ho to bihar kii nadiyon main milane vaali dolphinon ko dekhakar aap romaanch se bhar jaaenge or kisi bachche kii tarah aapkaa man prafullit ho jayega
 i believe that dolphins fascinate everyone
 inhen atyant samajhadaar or milansaar jeev mana jaataa he
 In India, dolphins are considered as vehicles of Gangaji
 ye bihar kii nadiyon main badi sankhya main pai jaati hai
 Due to the educational and conservation efforts of the government, watching dolphins has become a popular pastime throughout the state
 agar aap bihar ke bhagalpur jile main vikramshila ganga dolphin sanctuary main jaaen to vahaan aapako bahut-si dolphine dekhne ko mil jaaengi
 Of the 2,000 dolphins found in the Ganges in India, 1,300 dolphins are in Bihar alone
 yahaan ghaghara, gandak, kosi, brahmaputra, mahananda, kamala or ganga jaisi sabhi nadiyon main dolphinon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya he
 The natural beauty of horse bowl in Rajgir is included in some other attractions of Bihar
 ghoda katoraa jhil bahut sundar he
 It is believed to be the place where Jarasandha's stables used to be
 yah jhil rajgir main ek hari-bhari ghati main sthit he
 This place is said to be completely free from pollution
 griddhakuta chotii ko gidhon kii chotii mana jaataa he
 Vultures come here in large numbers
 is jagah par bhagwaan buddha gyaan praapt karne ke baad lambey samay tak rahe the
 Therefore, this place is considered very sacred for the followers of Buddhism
 yah ek shant jagah he or paidal yatra ke liye bahut pasand kii jaati he
 The rich culture and natural heritage of Bihar can be seen everywhere in the entire state
 yahaan ke hare-bhare jangal, khubasurat shant pahadibhan, jharne or pakshi vihaar har samay aapkaa swaagat karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Many of Bihar's natural attractions remain untouched, which need to be explored and appreciated

 piem narendra modi japan main tarifen bator rahe hai
 His tour not only removed the dust on india-japan relations but also added a new glow to it
 vahaan unka jaisaa swaagat hua vaisaa aaj tak bharat ke kisi bhi pradhanmantri kaa nahin hua
 Not only this, he also pledged to provide adequate funds for the development of India
 unki is yatra kaa uddeshy bharat ke vikaas ko badhaava dena tha or puraane rishton main nai jaan daalani tha or usamen vah puri tarah se safal hue
 Japan has also assured India $ 35 billion for its development and opened up avenues for Indian businessmen
 modi japan main itane lokapriy ho jaaenge
 Never thought of that
 unke sahaj swabhaav or janata se sidhe samvaad karne kii kala ne vahaan unhen "hero" bana diya
 The newspapers there are littered with his praise
 pichley kuch varshon se bharat kii videsh niti america kendrit hoti ja rahi thi lekin ab modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad halaat main jabardast badlaav hua he
 Japan is a great example of this
 usne modi kaa dil se swaagat kiya or hamaari raksha jaruraton ko samajhate hue unamem madad or technology dene kii baat kahi
 More than that, it lifted the ban on defense establishments of India about 16 years old
 modi ne japan ke pehle bhutan or nepal ke logon kaa dil jitkar yah sabit karne main koi kasar nahin chodi ki unki najaron main padosiyon se rishte behatar karnaa zyada mahatvapurn he
 Overall, Modi has created new energy in foreign policy and has tried to put India in a new line
 bharat kii videsh niti kai varshon se ek doraahe par khadi thi or yah tay nahin ho paa rahaa tha ki ham kiske saath hai or koun hamaare saath he
 Now this mist is completely cut off
 dekhnaa he ki is maheene america main modi kya karte hanore america sarkaar kya rukh rakhti he
 It has been a hundred days for the Modi government
 sau din kisi bhi raashtra kii jindagi main koi behad choti avadhi hoti he lekin nai sarkaar ke maamle main yekaphi badi lagati he
 The Modi government has taken many steps and corrected many things
 unhone or unke mantriyon ne bahut mehnat se kamkia
 His ministers lack experience but are working hard to make up for it
 modi ne bhrashtachar ko apanemantrimandal ke ird-gird fatakane bhi nahin diya he or har bada kadam phoonk-phoonk kar uthaaya ja rahaa he
 The great feature of this government is that it has considered the national interest paramount and has worked in that direction only
 yah sach he ki modi ne jitne bade vaade kiye the unamem se abhi kaiyon main kaaphi kaam baaki he
 The biggest task is to stop inflation, which is the biggest problem of the country
 iske liye unhen bade kadam uthaane honge
 Not only this, they will have to earnestly complete the unfinished works, which they were talking about till recently
 unhen kade faisle karne honge taaki arthvyavastha patari par aae or rojgaar bade taaki ve karodon yuva jo unke saath hai, dur na chale jaaen

 Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf called Prime Minister Narendra Modi anti-muslim and anti-pakistan
 saath hi kaha ki wo khud modi ko sakht bayaan se jawaab dete
 Yashmushraf of Kashmir, who came to Pervez Musharraf again, said that Modi should not consider Pakistan as a toy and he cannot explain it by slapping Pakistan
 tivitien ke managing editor rahul kanwal se khaas baatcheet main musharraf ne pradhanmantri modi se lekar border tak ke vivaad par bahut sari baaten kahin
 He blamed India for firing on the border and said that India should not underestimate the Pakistani army
 musharraf ne navaj sharif kii bhi aalochana kii
 He said that during his visit to India, Sharif should have also met the leaders of the Hurriyat Conference
 padhein puri baatcheet-kya ye mana jaae ki vartmaan sthiti ko dekhte hue bharat-pakistan ke rishte main madhurata aegi yaa phir takaraar badhati jaaegi?musharraf: maine manmohan singh sahab or vaajapeyi sahab se yah baat kahi thi
 i keep saying constantly that for the betterment of relationships, it is necessary for us to have three things
 eemaandaaree, lacheelaapan or saahas
 It is important that we listen to each other, accept and have a relationship of give and take
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi jis tarah shuruaati rukh rakhte hai, pakistan main aisi dharna he ki vah muslim virdohi hai, pakistan virdohi hai
 Ever since Modi has assumed power, the loc has begun to tighten
 us par vah aise bayaan dete hai, jinamein pakistan ke liye sakhti he
 As if Pakistan is a toy, they will shut up
 lekin main kahana chaahunga ki agar main pakistan kaa pradhan hota to main unase bhi zyada sakht bayani karata
 Do you believe that relations between the two countries will be strengthened under Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif? Musharraf: It should be
 anban kaa silsilaa khatm hona chahie
 i used to meet Hurriyat leaders whenever i went to India
 hamaare pradhanmantri ko milane se roka gaya to yah galat hua
 If India has created a red line on this side, it is its red line
 narendra modi hamaare pradhanmantri nahin hai, isliye ham ise nahin maanate
 Are you assuming that Pakistan's army has weakened? Musharraf: The Pakistani army is a very powerful army
 vah bilkul kamjor nahin padi he
 Hindustan should not be under the misconception that we have become weak and cannot face the Threat
 aapaki fouj hamase badi jarur he, lekin ham kamjor nahin hai
 We have nuclear power, which is also dangerous for the world
 iske alaava pakistan kii paaramparik fouj main bhi itani takat he ki vah bharat ko na sirf roak sakati he balki haraa sakati he

 Those who stooped down to the level of polticising an issue of national security have been exposed by the Honourable Supreme Court's decision today

 Those who tried to politicize should apologize
 India is a vibrant democracy with a healthy culture of debate, discussion and dissent
 However, plotting against the country with the intent to harm our citizens is not one of these
 Those who politicised this issue need to apologise

 So, was it a political compulsion for the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been ruling in the state for 22 years, to agree on the name of Vijay Rupani
 party ko maaloom he ki is baar kii jeet pichhali 5 jeeton se kahin mushkil bhari rahi he
 This time the Congress took a lot of power and brought more seats than expected
 vidhansabha main bhi vipakshi dal kaaphi majboot he
 Not to dissatisfy others The main basis of the party's agreement on Vijay Rupani's name seems to be that Rupani was the chief minister at the time of the election and his name was almost agreed upon in the party
 saath hi pradesh kii janata ko bhi unase khaas naaraazgi nahin thi
 Rupani hails from the Jain community and is very small (2%) in the state, so betting on them without offending other castes is like playing a safe game for the party
 rajya main thakur (8%), muslim (10%) ke alaava anusuchit jati (12%), anusuchit janajati (13%), patel (15%) or obisi (35%) acchhee pojishan main hai, aise main in kisi bhi samudaay se mukhyamantri bananaa matlab baaki jatiyon ko naaraaz karnaa hota
 Party beyond pressure When the BJP government is running in 19 states along with the Center and removing the sitting CM in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's hometown and handing over the command of the state to a new face, the party would have been under tremendous pressure
 aise main modi or bhaajapa kii chhavi hi girti
 In this sense, instead of a new face, it may be their political compulsion to wager on the old face
 baar-baar badal rahe netaais faisle se shaayad bhaajapa yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki wo kisi ke dabaav main nahin jhukne vaali
 Anyway, ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left Delhi and moved to Delhi, the bjp's hold has weakened, which also showed in the recent elections
 modi ke jane ke baad anandiben patel ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha, lekin kamjor hoti pakad ko dekhte hue unhone istipha diya or vijay roopaani mukhyamantri bane
 After changing the face of the Chief Minister for the third time in 3 and a half years, the message would be that the party was not able to choose even a qualified CM
 aise main thodaa napha or thodaa nuksaan ke saath roopaani hi mukhyamantri ke rup main bhaajapa kii pehali or aakhri pansad bane

 Vandana, who is going to her office near Senai Delhi station here, told that she has been waiting for the bus for 45 minutes but in the meantime only 2 buses passed through here, due to which the crowd was not able to climb in those buses
 vandana ke mutabik ye roj kii baat he
 He said that the situation gets worse on Saturday when the bus is found after waiting for more than an hour at times, although it gets space due to reduced crowds
 vandana ke alaava okhla main kaam karne vaale madan bhi kaaphi der tak bas kaa intjaar karte dikhe
 He said that he had to leave the house early so that the time could reach the office as he had to wait at the bus stop for a long time to go to Okhla
 iske baad ypi power house bas stop pahunche to bavana main factory main jane ke liye suresh bhi aadhe ghante se zyada vakt se bas kaa intjaar karte mili

 hamase baat karte hue bhi teevr mudrika seva bas ai lekin suresh usamen nahin chadh paae kyonki bas pehle se hi thasathas bhari hui thi
 On asking Suresh, he said that he was nervous thinking what the situation would be if odd-even was implemented, because the buses are already low
 or jo bhi based hai usamen jagah itani nahin hoti ki safar kiya ja sake
 So how will the increased crowd of millions in odd-even be made to travel in buses? Now the question is that when people are not satisfied with the service of buses running at present, then how will the government handle the increasing crowd during aud-even? mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ke ek vidhayak ne apni hi party ke khilaaf sansanikhej bayaan diya he

 He alleged that Rs 2 to 10 crores are being demanded for the BSP ticket and the existing mlas are not being spared either

 Earlier, Delhi Police gave Kapil an ultimatum to undergo a medical test
 police kaa kahana tha ki agar kapil mishra nahin maane to unhen jabardastee aruna ali aspataal le jaaya jayega
 For this, a large number of police forces were stationed outside Kapil's house, while Kapil went inside by closing the gates of the house

 Doctors giving false reports while i am on camera absolutely fine‚Äî Kapil Mishra (@kapilmishraaap)may 13, 2017when me and my family is refusing then how can i be forcefully removed
 Doctors gavr fake report, they report directly to Satyendra Jain ‚Äî Kapil Mishra (@kapilmishraaap) May 13, 2017 Earlier Kapil Mishra tweeted and accused the Aam Aadmi Party of hatching a conspiracy to break the fast
 mishrane kaha ki doctor satyendra jain ke adheen kaam kar rahe hai
 And giving incorrect reports
 main thik hum lekin doctor jabaran aspataal main bhartee karaane ke liye jor de rahe hai
 He said that this is a conspiracy to end Satyagraha before Sunday's revelations

 'duusare round ke khulaase se pehle hanuman kii sharan main kapilravivaar 14 may kii subah 11 baje bade khulaase se pehle shanivaar kii shamakapil apni patni priti or samarthakon ke sathkanot place ke hanuman mandir main puja-paath karne pahunche

 Kapil, who arrived to seek Lord Hanuman's blessing on Saturday evening, said that even after the completion of four days' fast, information is not available about the 5 big leaders going abroad
 mishra ne arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf ravivaar ko nayaa khulaasa karne kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki "is ladaai ko ladane ke liye hanuman ji kaa aashirwad lene aayaa hoon
 On Sunday, i will put some paper documents in front of people, so i have come to Bajrang Bali first
 taaki itnaa bada tathy janata ke saamne rakhane se pehle bajrang bali mujhe shakti den

 " pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra ke prabharee ke taur par kaashi kshetra ke bijepi ke sanghathan mantri chandrashekhar kaa tabadalaa gajiabad kar diya gaya he
 Chandrashekhar's photo with independent MLC and mafia Brijesh Singh going viral on social media is believed to be the reason for the transfer
 soshal mediaper viral hui photo varanasi main brijesh singh ke paariwarik aayojan ke samay khinchi gai thi, jabaki brijesh beti kii shaadi ke liye jamaanat par jail se baahar aae the
 Some other leaders are seen in the photo along with Brijesh Singh and bjp's organization minister Chandrashekhar, including Awadhesh Rai who joined BJP from BSP and Ravindra Jaiswal, bjp's MLA from Varanasi North
 koun hai chandrashekhar?chandrashekhar ne aresas ke prachaarak ke taur par kariyar shuru kiya tha
 He joined the BJP in the year 2013 and was appointed by the BJP as the organization minister of Kashi region
 sanghathan mantri bijepi main purnakalik pad he, jisaki takat adhyaksh ke baad sabase zyada maani jaati he
 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election victory from Varanasi in 2014, Chandrashekhar was also responsible for the mini PMO in Varanasi
 iske alaava purvi upi kebijepisanghathan kii kaman bhi vahi sambhaal rahe the
 He was also looking after the development work of the pm's parliamentary constituency

 kudarat kaa kahar to apana kaam kar chukaa
 Who was to waste
 ab baari kudarat ke hi banaae insaanon kii he
 The havoc turned humans into zombies, so some humans are now looking for their greedy lives in the same corpses
 devbhumi ke daanvon kii kai kahaniyaan or tasviren aapane dekhi or suni hongi
 But after seeing the incident which we are going to tell you, you will say only one thing
 
 
 'mat kaho ham insaan hai'
 There is a corpse inside the shroud
 ek aurat kii laash, un saikadon laashon main se ek laash, jo 16 june kii raat uttarakhand ke pahaado par kudarat ke kahar ne giraayi thi
 The corpse lies somewhere between Kedarnath and Gaurikund
 laash kaa koi daavedaar nahin he
 An executioner ejects the finger of the corpse from the middle of the shroud
 paas main lohe ke wo tamaam auzaar hai, jo uske kaam aane vaale hai
 Now with a tool he tries to extract the gold ring from the finger of the corpse
 saath main iske kuch saathi bhi khadey hai, jo apane mobile se isaki video bhi bana rahe hai, par wo bephikr apane kaam main laga he
 Meanwhile, a woman's voice comes, she asks why you are making a video and what are you doing
 wo aurat kii baat ansuni kar ab bhi kisi tarah laash kii anguthi nikaalane main laga he
 Then after some time, he laughs shamelessly to give you
 
 
 itnaa kehane ke baad wo khud hi bataata he ki kaise kuch nepali lootparaat kar rahe hai or ve pitenge
 Between things, he is still struggling wholeheartedly
 par shaayad laash ke saath-saath ungali bhi phool chuki thi, lihaaza tamaam koshish ke baad bhi anguthi nahin nikal rahi he
 In the meantime, someone says to remove it from the place
 
 
 plas se nikaal
 Now he tries to pull the ring from Plas, but the ring does not come out
 jab tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi anguthi nahin nikali, to aakhir main ungali katkar laash se wo anguthi nikaal lee gai
 Another embarrassing picture
 
 
 jaaniye maut ke kuch aise saudagaron kii kahani, jise dekhakar aap vaaki yah sochane par majaboor ho jaaenge ki kya vaaki ye insaan kahalaane ke laayak bhi hai? uttarakhand ke pahaado main fanse logon ko helicopter se nikaala ja rahaa he
 But do you know that some private helicopter people are taking bribe to save their lives too? The bribe is about who will first sit in the helicopter

 haalanki is sting oparation ke baad jab hamane khule camere par pakade gaye aviation company ke jiem diparaj singh mehara se baat kii, to wo apane pehle ke bayaan se puri tarah mukar gaye
 Moreover, when we reminded him about his sting operation, he was very shamelessly denied all the things
 is puure masale par uttarakhand sarkaar kaa kahana he ki bachaav kaary main jitne bhi helicopter kii sevaayen lee ja rahi hai, un sabakaa kharchaa rajya sarkaar uthaayegi
 According to a senior government official, if a private company is seeking money from someone for rescue, then action will be taken on it

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has come under attack from the opposition parties over the controversial circular of his government, which warned of action against the media for any defamatory news
 isapar nishaanaa sadhate hue congress or bijepi ne un par 'paakhandee' or 'aloktantric' hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 Congress leader PC Chacko said, 'when the government is being criticized, when the media is exposing the wrong acts of their government, the Chief Minister is objecting to it
 yah mukhyamantri ke aloktantric ravaiye ko darshata he
 ' isi tarah kii raay jaahir karte hue bijepi ne kaha ki jahaan kejariwal abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke bare main baat karte hai, vahiin vah 'sabakaa galaa ghontna' chaahate hai
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said, 'he wants freedom of uncontrolled expression but wants to strangle everyone else
 yah paakhand kii paraakaashtha he
 ' aapako bataa den ki dilli sarkaar ne ek patr jari karke sabhi adhikariyon se kaha he ki agar sarkaar yaa kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf koi aapattijanak tippanee karata he to uski shikaayat pradhan sachiv (grih) se kar sakate hai
 (read - Delhi government's decree, objectionable comment will be filed, defamation case) is circular par dilli pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ne kaha ki yah 'vicitra' he ki kejariwal chunaav se pehle jo bhi bolaa karte the har kaam uske ulat kar rahe hai
 He said that this is not happening for the first time
 maakan ne kaha, 'jaise hi unki (kejariwal kii) party satta main ai unhone bhawan (sachivalay) main media ke pravesh par roak laga di
 He should not have had problems with the media, as his party came to power with his help
 'tippaniyan Criticizing Kejriwal, Congress leader Chacko said that he is being exposed on many issues and the AAP government has not been functioning like a government since day one, as internal strife has affected its functioning
 unhone kaha, 'jimmedaar padon par baithe logon ko aalochana ko sunne ke liye paryaapt dhary rakhana chahie or yah is baat kaa bhi sanket detaa he ki sarkaar main gadabadi, bhrashtachar he or samanvay kaa abhaav he
 ' congress netaa pisi chaako ne kaha, 'jab sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he, jab media unki sarkaar ke galat krityon ko ujagar kar rahi he to mukhyamantri us par aapatti jataa rahe hai
 This reflects the undemocratic attitude of the Chief Minister

 " The Defense Ministry does not want to make any kind of omission after the Pathankot attack
 iske liye mantralay ne har vibhaag kii taiyaariyon par najar daalane kaa faisla kiya he
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar gave this information on Thursday
 parrikar ne kaha, 'pathankot hamale ke baad raksha mantralay ne ek cameti kaa gathan kiya tha, jo raksha se jude sabhi vibhaagon kii taiyaariyon
 The committee will visit all these bases and will submit its suggestions to the Ministry of External Affairs soon
 'pakistan main hamale par jataayaa dukhbuudhvaar ko pakistan ke charasadda main bacha khan uniwarsity main hue aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 On the lines of the terrorist attack on the Army School of Peshawar in December 2014, 25 people were killed in this attack
 isapar bharat ke raksha mantri ne dukh jataayaa he
 Manohar Parrikar said, 'any terrorist attack or murder of innocent people is always condemnable and cannot be justified in any way
 hamen un logon kii maut kaa dukh he
 'let us tell you that a former Pakistan minister Rehman Malik has blamed Parrikar and India for this attack
 pathankot hamale ke baad parrikar ne kaha tha ki jab tak dushman apano ko khone ke dard ko nahin sahataa, tab tak use hamaare dard kaa ahsaas nahin hoga
 Rehman Malik made this allegation, making this statement the basis

 50 paise on postcard !!! ' sampradayikta ke gambhir aarope jhelane vaale bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko patel jayanti par kaha ki desh ko sardaar patel ke secularism kii jarurat he, vot bank ke secularism kii nahin
 He was speaking at the foundation stone program of 'statue of Unity' in Bharuch, Gujarat
 prastaavit sardaar patel kii murtiduniya kii sabase oonchi murti hogi
 Its height will be 182 meters and its face will be towards Narmada Dam
 yah america kii mashhoor 'stachu of liberty' se doguna oonchi hogi
 With a plan of Rs 2500 crore, Modi cleverly linked the development, charm, pride of the country and Patel's dream
 unhone sanketon main kaha ki sardaar patel kii yah pratimaa bharat ko vaisaa sthaan dilaa sakati he jaisaa china ko uske viksit shahar shanghai ne yaa japan ko bullate train ne dilaayaa
 He stressed that the days of taking India lightly are now over
 padhie unka bhaashan jyon kaa tyon
 Brothers and sisters, today the foundation of new history and new resolve is being laid on the banks of Narmada 
 kai saalon se is sapane ko maine man main sanjoya tha
 Many people had given color in this dream, suggested it
 kai manomanthan ke baad is yojana garbhaadhan hua
 Many people got guidance, inspiration and blessings
 un sabakaa abhinandan-naman karata hum
 This is the dream of all of us
 narmada jila chota jila he, iske vikaas ke liye or aane vaale dinon main yah kaam or saralata se ho, iske liye prashasnic str par kai faisle hue hai
 But after evaluating all, the government felt that a small taluka (town) should be built here to speed up this work
 mujhe pani ke mudde par kai suzav aae
 Tribal brothers have full rights, they will get water
 kisaanon ko bhi pani milegaa
 We have discovered a technical solution
 narmada ke baayen kinare ko bhi sinchai kaa laabh mili, iske liye bhi kaam kiya jayega
 Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River and the attempt to transport water through it in gujarat-rajasthan was Sardar Patel's dream
 kisi jamaane main pyaason ke liye pani kii matki bhi ghar ke baahar rakhane waalon ko samaaj aadar se dekhtaa tha
 We have water value here, especially in gujarat-rajasthan, because we have faced water scarcity
 aaj bhi gujarat sarkaar kaa sabase zyada bajet pani ke kaam ke liye diya jaataa he
 Our government has spent double the amount spent by the previous governments for the Sardar Sarovar Dam project in the last ten years
 lekin is saare kaam kaa sapana sardaar patel ne dekha
 All the work is being done on his dream
 agar ham pani kii vyavastha na kar pate to kahaan hote, koun jaanata hamen
 There was negative growth in Gujarat, people were leaving
 aaj rajasthan ke kisi bhi vyakti se milte hai to kahata he ki aapane bahut acha kaam kiya, jo hamen pani diya
 Sardar Patel is responsible for all this
 ab bhi gulaami kaa itnaa boj he, aazaadee ke itane saal baad bhi
 We have not yet come out of the shadow of slavery
 or hamane gulaami kii chaaya se nikalne ke liye is gulaami ke saaye ko todane ke liye kuch aise kaam karne honge
 Because of which we should stand in front of the world with pride and self-respect
 aaj main aapako yaad dilaataa hum
 When the budget was presented in India 15‚Äì17 years ago, it was kept in Parliament at five o'clock in the evening
 aazaadee ke pachaas saal baad bhi aisa hota tha
 Someone wondered why this was so
 isliye tha kyonki angrejon ke jamaane se parampara thi
 When we had five in the evening, it was 11 in Britain and at that time the work of Parliament started here
 jab vaajapeyi ji pradhanmantri bane tab yah parampara todi gai auki subah 11 baje bajet rakhaa janaa shuru hua
 Our thinking does not even know how much slavery is being held
 mitron is soch ke saamne ek swabhimaan ke saath khadey hone kii aavashyaktaa he
 It has become a habit to look at India inferiorly
 bharat se ho, chalo baaju jaao
 When Vajpayee ji detonated the atomic bomb shortly after coming to rule, the whole world considered it iron
 duniya ab hindustan kaa naam sunati he, to kahati he, haa kuch to he
 Friends, why should there not be a citizen of our country inside the world
 koi parampara kyon na ho
 Time demanded in today's era
 hindustan aaazaad hone ke baad bhi agar duusare deshon ko gaurav se dekha jaataa ho, to hamaare hindustan ko kyon na dekha jaekisi jamaane main china ko koun dekhtaa tha
 China made a Shanghai
 duniya ke saamne pesh kar diya
 People's habit of thinking towards China has changed
 ye jo puraane par nayaa china bana, shanghai ke aasapaas bana
 When Japan made a high speed bullet train, the world said, "hey brother, there is something
" america ne arabon dollar kharch kar chand par bheja, duniya ne loha mana
 We should also do a global positioning
 sava arub kaa desh ek takat banakar ubharna chahie
 There can be many routes
 anek kriya pratikriya ho sakati hai
 Today only this memorial of Sardar Patel
 
 
 sardaar sarovar dam bana, sardaar sahab kaa sapana puraa hua
 He was from our Gujarat
 magar ye sapana bahut bada he
 These grand monuments
 jisaki oonchai hindustan kii tarah dekhne ke liye majaboor karegi
 The task of uniting such a large kingdom
 angrejon kii kutil kootneeti kaa pardaafash, ye bharat kaa samarth ham duniya ke saamne pesh karnaa chaahate hai
 If you see the heritage of history, after Chanakya, if someone did the work of uniting this country, then it is Sardar Patel
 kya ham rana pratap kaa sammaan karenge
 We will honor Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 ham bhagat singh, sukhdev raajaguru kaa sammaan karenge
 Was he a member of BJP? kya unheen kaa sammaan hoga desh main, jo bhaajapa kaa sadsy ho
 a country is bigger than a party
 or desh ke liye marane vaala hamaare liye sabase badhkar he
 And that's why it is an insult to link Sardar Saheb with any party
 wo dal unke itihaas kaa hissaa he
 Even Narendra Modi cannot deny this
 hamen viraasat ko kabhi baantnaa nahin chahie
 Our legacies are shared
 lekin desh aaazaad hone ke baad gandhi ji chuaachhut ke khilaaf jivan bhar ladate rahe
 But this new political untouchability has increased
 ham ise bhi nasht karen
 Friends, i had the opportunity to meet the PM two days ago
 unhone ek baat bahut acchhee kahi
 i express my gratitude media ke mitra samaj nahin aae
 The matter went the opposite way
 ho saktaa he unki roji roti kii demand the
 The PM said that Sardar Saheb was a true secular
 ham bhi kehete hai ki desh ko sardaar sahab vaala secularism chahie
 Not a vote bank
 or isliye pradhanmantri ji, sardaar sahab kaa secularism chahie is desh ko
 India became one
 raaje rajavaade kisi ek sampradaay yaa samaaj ke nahin the
 All were from different traditions
 isliye mitron main bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa abhinandan karata hum
 i urge you
 ham sab milakar sardaar sahab kaa secularism aage badhayenkuch logon ke man main aata hoga kyon itnaa bada smarak
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar, he has many memorials
 magar maananaa padegaa ki dalit shoshit samaaj ke liye vah bhagwaan kaa rup hai
 And whoever wishes for the oppressed Dalits, they get inspiration from Babasaheb Ambedkar
 tab ye nahin poocha jaataa ki wo kis dal se the
 His life inspires us
 ye sanjhi viraasat he, ham sabko garv hona chahie
 We should all have our heart for the country
 nai peedi ko kaha pataa chalegaa ki louh purush kaise hue
 What was that power in him? ham sardaar sahab kaa smarak banane ke saath saath hindustan ke kone kone main phir se ek baar ekta kaa mantra pahunchaana chaahate hai
 We are well aware of this
 ki bharat kii pragati shanti ekta or sadbhaav ke bina nahin ho sakati
 Mother's milk can never crack
 praantvaad ke jhagade, bhashavad ke jhagade, jatvaad or oonch neech ke jhagade
 These things destroyed our country
 kisi dal ke kisi rajaneta kii jholii to bhar gai hogi, lekin meri bharat maa kaa gaurav ksheen hua
 If we have to regain that glory, then the mantra of unity has to be brought home
 is smarak ke jariye sardaar sahab ke sapanom kaa samaran karte hue, unki aawaaj jise kai barason se dabocha gaya tha
 By raising it
 kai logon ne sardaar sahab kii aawaaj pehali baar suni hogi
 Go stand tall
 man main feeling aata he
 We built the Mahatma Mandir first
 ye maje kii baat he, jab hamane ye mandir banaaya
 The work is still going on
 lekin us samay hamen kisi ne chalange kiya, ki modi tum to bijepi vaale ho, gandhi bijepi main nahin the
 So why are you making magar jab sardaar sahab kii baat ai, to pareshaani kyon ho rahi he
 Friends, today Gujarat is feeling proud
 pehle 31 oktober ko jo sarkari aid aate the, usamen sardaar sahab kahin nahin hote the
 Today it is not so
 ye gujarat effect he
 How can our great men be forgotten? hamaari bhi kisi ne aalochana kii ho, tab bhi unke mahaan kaamon kii puja karnaa aage vaali peedi kaa kaam hota he
 It is our endeavor that the coming generations of India live and know history
 koi samaaj apane itihaas ko bhuulakar ke, apane itihaas ke grassroot se agar bikhar jaataa he, to jaise mul se ukhda hua ped kitna bhi bada kyon na ho
 As the stream of society dries up, history gives him strength and inspiration
 raste khojane ko milte hai
 If there is a need in the mind of society for our country
 to hamaare samaaj kaa itihaas bodh hona chahie
 Through this Sardar Saheb's statue, we want to give that vision to the next generation
 bhaaiyon bahanon ye murti kaise banegi
 In this, we will put experts from all over the world
 chota kaam nahin he
 How many metals will have to be found? ye bataa detaa hum ki murti aisi banegi, jo sadiyon tak salaamat rahe
 We want to combine this work for the unity of India
 isliye tijori se rupee nikaal murti ban jaae
 He does not want to
 jan jan ko jodna chaahate hai
 Because Sardar Saheb did the work of unity, that should become the message of Sardar Saheb, so he wants to connect every village
 unase ham kuch maang rahe hai
 What are you asking for? kuch logon ne gande shabd prayog kiye
 There is filth in his mind
 kisaan, uske ghar main talwaar top bhi he, tab bhi vah sabase zyada kisi ko prem karata he, to kheti ke aujaar ko karata he
 He is most valuable for that
 sardaar vallabh bhai patel kisaan the, louh purush the
 Sardar Patel did the work of unity
 isliye hindustan ke har kone ko jodna he
 He was a farmer, so the farmer has to be added
 vah louh purush the, isliye lohe ko maangana he
 We have prayed to every village panchayat
 ki kisaan ne khet ke andar jis aujaar kaa prayog kiya he
 The instrument that is played in the lap of Mother India
 jisane garib ke pet ko bharne ke liye bharat maa ke saath ksht jhela he
 i do not want a cannon
 mujhe talwaar chahie
 i need a piece of the tool that my farmer has used in the field
 use pighalaayenge
 Will extract the best steel
 us lohe kaa arq us murti main jagah paaegaa, tab hindustan kaa har naagarik kahegaa, meraa gaanv bhi isamen he
 We will take photographs of the head of the village, take a little history of the village
 puraa smarak banegaa, usamen ek virtual world hoga, jisamen hindustan ke saat lakh gaanvon kii tasviir hogi, katha hogi, koi pachaas saal baad aayega, to apane gaanv kaa itihaas dekhegaa
 We will do this holy work
 aaj desh main taj mahal dekhne ke liye yatri aate hai
 Passengers will go to see the Statue of Liberty in America
 ham chaahate hai ye puure vishwa ke liye mahaan centre bane
 Look at our height
 is desh kii oonchai ko naape
 And when this entire memorial will be built
 ham deshavaasiyon ke liye vah prerana kaa tirth hoga
 Migration will become a destination for the world
 har ek ko apane apane liye jo chahie wo milegaa
 We have added the future of India to this memorial
 desh main adivaasiyon ke kalyaan ke liye chaahe jis sarkaar ne jo kaam kiye hon
 We want to store them all
 mere adivasee bhai bahanon ke jivan main nayaa umang utsaah kaise aae, ve sampann kaise bane
 How to be a leader
 uske research kaa kaam bhi isi smarak ke tahat ho
 This country is the country of the village
 patel kisaan putr the
 What new science is needed for the welfare of the farmer, how the villages move towards modernity
 kisaan aadhuniktaa ke maarg ko kaise aage badaye
 How did they get education initiation, for agriculture
 gaanv garib kisaan ke liye
 We also want to add this work to it
 mitron duniya main is kaam ko karne vaali shreshth companiyon ko bulaayaa he
 Three years ago put that fantasy to the fore
 use saakaar karne ke liye export aae
 Three years of his aspects were closely followed
 tab jaakar ham ise aage badha rahe he
 When we first said this work
 mujhe kuccha ke logon ne chaandi se taulakar bhent di thi
 i asked, brother why are you giving so soon
 abhi to yojana ban rahi he
 Then the people of Kutch responded
 modi ji, agar sardaar sahab na hote, is baandh kaa sapana na dekha hota, to hamaare kuccha main pani na pahunchataa, ham unke karjadaar hai
 Went to Mumbai vahaan chaandi se taula, vah bhi isi main lagegaa
 We have to add the people of India
 shashan, jan desh kii shakti, bharat sarkaar kii shakti sabko jodna he
 Even if the Earth belongs to Gujarat, the dream is of India
 ham kai barason se kah rahe hai ki sardaar sarovar baandh kaa kaam puraa ho
 But there are some people who do not make a statement, they do not go to their belly
 kuch mitron ne modi ko samaapt karne kii supaari failaai he
 Don't know what smells keep spreading
 mujhe pataa ki piem kii team har shabd sunati he, unke bos kii team sunati he
 That is why i want to say, there is still a bus gate in Sardar Sarovar Dam
 baaki kaam ho chukaa he
 Only after the gate will the most water be filled
 kai baar piem se mila
 Said, it will take three years
 band mat karne dena, khadey to karne to, mili piem to bole ki baat to aapaki samajhane kii he
 Got it after a year, then said that hey is not done yet
 phir mili to phir vahi baat
 Not only this, there should be a committee under the chairmanship of former judges to see the rehabilitation in MP etc
 bhale maharashtra main congress kii or baaki do main hamaari sarkaar ho
 These three states completed the rehabilitation work
 bharat sarkaar kii cameti ne sweekaar kar liya
 Orally stated, printed in newspapers
 ab bas meeting bulaakar final order dena he
 Make a gate
 pichley aath maheenon se rukaa padaa he
 i tell the officers
 pucho kya takalif he
 Sir, you understand
 main khulaa boluun
 Got it
 mujhe nahin bolnaa
 That's why work has stopped
 main aaj phir narmada maiyaa ke tat se piem ko aagrah karata hum
 Maharashtra Gujarat needs water
 madhya pradesh ko bijli chahie
 Maharashtra will get 400 million
 main yahaan bada shilaalekh lagane ko taiyaar hum
 The Central Government did this work
 modi kaa naam bhi mat lo
 At least allow the dam to be completed
 aise kaam main raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Brothers and sisters, i hope is narmada ke tat par, gujarat ke pashuon kii, garibon kii, kisaanon kii, ped paudhon kii aawaaj desh ke pradhanmantri tak pahonchegi
 There is a bigger country than the party, this feeling will awaken in their mind and do such a great job for India, complete it, be proud, cut the ribbon
 wo chahen to main aauungaa nahin
 i say yours today
 aap anand kiijie, magar puraa kiijie

 ) kashmir maamle main aaj har kisi kii jubaan main Article 370 kaa naam he
 There are mixed reactions to the matter of ending it
 kya ye dhara kanuunan khatm ho sakati he yaa ye sthaayee he
 Know what the constitution experts are saying about this 1
 Constitution experts have their own opinion regarding Article 370 and Article 35A
 samvidhan visheshgy subhash kashyap ne aajtak
 In a special conversation with in, said that there are no two opinions that Article 370 of the Indian Constitution is completely temporary
 is baat kaa zikr anuchhed main hi kiya gaya he
 2
 Article 370 ko jahaan tak hataane kaa sawaal he, to isko lekar samvidhan main do baaten kahin gai he
 The first thing is that Parliament can remove Article 370 with the consent of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly, while the second provision is that under Article 368 of the Constitution, Parliament can abolish it by two-thirds majority
 3
 Subhash Kashyap says that Article 368 empowers Parliament to amend or remove any article of the Constitution
 ye hi anuchhed 370 ke bare main kai gutthiyaan sulajhaata he
 4
 samvidhan visheshgy dike dube ne aajtak
 In a special conversation with in, said that Article 370 does not make special provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, rather it makes temporary provision for the state
 is anuchhed ko bhartiya sansad do tihaai bahumat se khatm kar sakati he
 LIVE: Modi government abolishes the privileges given to Jammu and Kashmir in 370, President's approval 5
 anuchhed 370 ke paksh main nahin the ambedkar: dike dube kaa kahana he ki dow bhimrao ambedkar bhartiya samvidhan main Article 370 ke paksh main nahin the
 Therefore Sheikh Abdullah proposed to add this article to the Constitution and this article was added to the Constitution after a brief discussion
 6
 This article was not seriously discussed in Parliament
 dike dube kaa kahana he ki ambedkar ne kaha tha ki vah jammu-kashmir kii policy ko lekar khush nahin he
 7
 samvidhan visheshgy dube kaa kahana he ki bhartiya samvidhan ke Article 35A ko presidential order ke jariye joda gaya tha
 When this presidential order was issued, the Prime Minister was Jawaharlal Nehru and the President was Dr
 Rajendra Prasad
 kashmir jammu kashmir kii samasya kii asli jad anuchhed 35A hi he
 It can also be eliminated by the Presidential Order
 8
 Article 370 of the Constitution of India makes a temporary provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ke liye vishesh upbandh kaa nahin, balki asthai upbandh kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 9
 iske baad anuchhed 370 ke tahat constitution (aplicoshan tu jammu kashmir) order 1954 jari karke samvidhan main Article 35A ko samvidhan main joda gaya
 10
 saal 2014 main supreme court main ek enjio ne yachika daayar kar is anuchhed ko ek bharat kii bhaavana ke khilaaf or algaavvaad ko badhaava dene vaala praavdhaan bataaya
 The legality of Article 35A and Article 370 was challenged in this petition
 is yachika main tark diya gaya ki aazaadee ke baad desh kaa samvidhan banane ke liye jo samvidhan sabha bani thi usamen jammu-kashmir ke 4 pratinidhi bhi shaamil the
 Also, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was never given special status
 ye bhi tark diya gaya ki 35-e ek asthaayee upbandh tha jise rajya main halaat ko us samay sthir karne ke liye joda gaya tha
 The framers of the Constitution did not make this article

 jald hi yah baat police tak ja pahunchi
 But on the other hand, Ravi's condition in the hospital was continuously deteriorating
 jahrile injection kaa istemalgardan main chubhoi gai ek sui ne use ek hi jatke main jismani taur par tod kar rakh diya tha
 The doctors tried a million
 lekin choubees ghante guzarate-guzarate wo ho gaya, jo nahin hona chahie tha
 Ravi lost his life
 ji haa, ek sui ke waar se ravi maaraa gaya
 But the question was, why did that unknown person kill Ravi? What hostility did he have with Ravi? What was the last injection that proved fatal for Ravi? And most importantly, why did he choose such a strange way to kill Ravi? So to know the answers to all these questions, it was most important to open the mouth of his killer
 katl ke peeche badi sajishqatil ne pehle to vardiwaalon ko uljhane kii koshish kii
 But when he started telling the truth, the policemen were also surprised
 kyonki sachai ye thi ki uski sidhe taur par ravi se koi dushmani nahin thi
 Yes, it was certain that the attacker named Prem Singh, who was caught with an injection of mauka-e-vardat, lived in the neighborhood of Ravi's in-laws
 usne poochtacha main bataaya ki ravi ke qatl ke peeche asal main wo nahin, balki kisi or kaa haath he
 Prem Singh, a betrayer of three lakhs, told the police that he had only carried out this incident
 or iske badale main use teen lakh rupee milane hai
 That is, Ravi was killed with betel nut
 or jab qaatil ne saazish rachane vaale kaa naam liya, to ek baar phir har koi hairaan tha
 Do you know why? Because Ravi had nothing to do with this person directly
 balki vah to apane qatl kii saazish rachane vaale ko jaanata tak nahin tha
 But because of Ravi's murder, it is rarely seen
 ravi naa to apni jaan lene vaale ko jaanata tha
 Nor did the person who created the murder plot, but in spite of that he was not only killed
 balki qaatilon ne qatl ke liye aisa ajeeb tareeqa dhundha jisaki misaal puri duniya main ikke-dukke se zyaada dhudhen nahin milti
 The gym trainer hatched a conspiracy to kill Ravi Kumar, an employee of Kotak Mahindra Bank, was killed
 use bich sadak par gardan main injection chubho kar maaraa gaya tha
 And the injection is not like that but of poisonous cocktails of many different drugs
 lekin qatl kaa ye tareeqa jitna ajeeb tha, iske peeche kii saazish kahin usase bhi zyaada chaunkaane vaali he
 The master mind of this murder was Aneesh Yadav, a gym trainer
 mritak kii patni kaa purana premi niklaa mukhya aaropeedrasal, dilli ke dwarka ilaake kaa rahane vaala anish yadav, makatool ravi kumaar kii patni kaa purana ashiq tha
 Both studied together in college and from here Aneesh was lying behind that girl
 aage chal kar donon kii shaadi alag-alag jagahon par ho gai
 But Aneesh was living separately from his wife these days
 isi bich uske dimag main apane puraane pyaar ko dobaaraa hasil karne kaa fitur savaar hua
 And just because of this fit, she decided to remove her beloved husband Ravi from the road
 lekin iske liye usne ek aisi kaufanaak or ajeebogarib saazish rachi, jaisaa aam taur par dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 Before the poisonous drugs were stolen for the murder, he found a full-fledged method of killing to avoid being caught
 internet khangale or injection ke zahreele waar se apane shikaar kii jaan lene kaa faisalaa kiya
 But he did not want to do this work himself
 iske liye usne apni mashooqa ke pados main rahane vaale ek physiotherapist prem singh ko raji kiya
 The matter was fixed for three lakh rupees
 phisiotherapist kii madad se anish ne kuch aisi dawaaon kaa pataa lagaaya, jinka cocktail insaani zindagi ke liye ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he
 Now he was looking for such medicines, because they are not easily found in medical story
 isi bich ek mauka haath aa gaya, jab anish ke jaankaar ek pulisavaale ne khudakushi kii koshish kii
 The policeman was admitted to AIIMS and Aneesh, who arrived as a Timardar, stole some anesthesia
 sisitivi main kaid kaatilon kii tasveerendiseepi jatin narwal ne bataaya ki qatl se pehle donon ne ek dukaan se prem ke liye naqaab bhi kharida, lekin is khariddaari se pehle police ko uljhane ke liye donon apane-apane mobile phone ghar main chhod kar gaye
 It is further said that both the pictures were captured in the CCTV camera of the shop
 saazish ke mutabik prem ko apane shikaar ravi kii gardan main injection maar kar bhaag janaa tha
 Aneesh even kept telling him that even if he is caught, do not forget his name and in return he will help him to escape from the case legally
 lekin ittefaq se injection maarane vaala prem maukey se hi pakadaa gaya or police interogeshan main tut bhi gaya
 And with this the whole conspiracy of murder was revealed
 anish yadav par pehle se darj hai kai mukademenudhar, maukey se pakade gaye qaatil prem singh kii nishandehi par jab police ne saazish rachane ke ilzaam main anish ko giraftaar kiya, to or bhi kai baaten pataa chalin
 It was clear that Aneesh had been accused of a gang rape case earlier too
 uske khilaaf dwarka ilaake main hi 2010 main gangrape kaa ek cese darj hua tha
 And these days he was out on bail
 duusari ore, uski patni ne bhi uske khilaaf dahej ke liye sataane kaa mukadmaa kar rakhaa tha
 But despite all this, his senses did not come and he only took an innocent life due to his whims and one-sided love

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki desh ko mukesh ambani chalaa rahe hai or rahul-modi unheen ke do chehre hai
 Ambanis surprised everyone by revealing the Swiss bank account number of the Ambani brothers
 kejariwal ne daawa kiya, 'mukesh ambani kaa acount number, '5090160983' or anil ambani kaa '5090160984' he, kya modi satta main aane ke baad unka paisa waapas lekar aaenge?''chaay vaale ke paas kahaan se aae helicopter?'arvind kejariwal ne saadagi ke sawaal par bhi modi or rahul ko aade haathon liya

 People criticize the Delhi government's decision of subsidy but i will definitely give subsidy to the poor
 unhone logon se apil karte hue kaha, 'purna bahumat do to bhrashtachar mitaa duungaa
 Kejriwal also clarified on his resignation
 unhone kaha ki bijepi vaale mujh par bhaag jane kaa aarope lagaate hai, lekin unhen pataa hona chahie ki laal bahadur shastri ne bhi ek train haadase ke baad railmantri ke pad se istipha de diya tha
 He did not run

 Why did Modi not leave the chair to contest the Lok Sabha elections? Kejriwal said that the BJP says that i resigned to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 main poochna chahta hum ki modi ne kyon nahin diya istipha, nitish kumaar or jayalalita ne kyon nahin diya, loksabhaa chunaav to unhen bhi ladanaa he

 He told the people of Haryana to vote for Modi and Rahul happily if you are happy with your life
 lekin khush nahin ho to is ladaai main saath aana
 Kejriwal clearly said that his party will field candidates for all 9 seats in Haryana in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and all 90 seats in the state in the upcoming assembly

 ' unhone janata se kaha, 'uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii bahumat kii sarkaar banaaie, taaki ham paanch saal baad ham hisaab den

 On March 11, after the formation of the BJP and allies government, they will make the police station and jail in jail in the true sense
 mouj kar rahe saare bahubaliyon ko ek hi din main thik kar denge
 They also get the policemen taken, they grab land and houses

 ek taraf 12 sitambar ko use faansee dene kii taiyaari ho rahi he, to vahiin coli phir supreme court main sajaa par roak lagaakar punarvichaar karne kii yachika daayar kar saktaa he
 It is to be noted that on Tuesday, the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, while giving a historic verdict, said that the reconsideration petition of those sentenced to be hanged would be heard in open court and the convict would be given half an hour to present his case
 peeth ne ye bhi kaha ki jin logon kii punarvichaar yachika khaarij ho chuki he, wo ek maheene ke bheetar phir yachika daayar kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court on July 24 dismissed Koli's reconsideration petition on delayed grounds
 yani is faisle ke aadhaar par coli ko sunwaayee kaa ek or mauka mil saktaa he
 However, on the same day, Koli appealed to the court to stop the decision on the review petition and send the hearing to the constitution bench, but it was rejected by the court
 darasal, 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaake main faansee kii sajaa paane vaale yaqub memon or laal kila hamale ke doshi aarif samet chah doshiyon ne supreme court main arji daakhil kar maang kii thi ki punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee chember main nahin balki khuli court main ho or doshi ko bhi apana paksh rakhane kii ijaajat ho
 The matter was referred to the constitution bench of five judges and on September 2, the court gave this decision
 haalanki peeth ne ye bhi kaha ki jinaki curative peetishan yani upachaaratmak yachika bhi khaarij ho chuki he, unhen ye mauka nahin milegaa
 With this decision, Yakub Memon also got a chance to file a review petition in the court
 isi aadhaar par coli supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa he

 supreme court aae din tajmahal ko lekar uttar pradesh sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaati rahati he, lekin aisa lagata he upi kii yogi sarkaar ko iskaa koi asar nahin hota he
 Because of the condition of Taj Mahal due to rain, this is what it looks like
 agra main hui bhaykanr barish kaa pani taj mahal ke andar ghus gaya he
 Let us tell you that the Supreme Court had strongly reprimanded the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh while hearing the case related to the preservation of Taj Mahal
 taj kii hifaazat kaa vijan document kaa masauda pesh karne par court ne kaha ki ham yahaan aapkaa dastavej jaanchane ke liye nahin baithe hai

 ke venugopal ne kaha ki yadi is aitihaasik smarak kaa vishwa dharohar kaa darja waapas liya jaataa he to yah desh ke liye bahut hi sharmindagi vaali baat hogi
 The way the water has entered the Taj Mahal has once again exposed the claims of the administration
 prashasan or sarkaar ne agar samay rahete taiyaariyaan kii hoti to tajmahal ke andar pani nahin ghusaa hota
 Tourists come from all over the world to see this seventh wonder of the world
 aise main yogi sarkaar or prashasan kii laaparvaahee desh hi nahin duniya ke saamne bhi aa gai he
 6 killed due to rain in Agra; 6 people died in rain in Agra in last 24 hours

 So far, about Rs 800 crore has been lost due to rain in the last two days
 isamen sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaa he or kai saamaan bhi kharaab hue hai
 Due to rain, the Agra administration has ordered all schools in the district to remain closed on July 27 and 28
 kai jagahon par baari jalairao ke kaaran trephic jam kii samasya aa rahi he
 Traffic collapsed due to a tree falling on MG Road in Agra
 prashasan ne chetavanee jari kar kaha he ki 27 july kii raat ko agra main aandhi ke saath barish aa sakati he
 The administration has advised that citizens stay indoors unless absolutely necessary
 agar baadh jaise halaat banate hai to aise main pani ko ghar main aane se rokane ke liye jaruri intjaam kar len
 Due to rain, torrential rains are raining in many areas of the country
 dilli-ensiaar main bhi mausam kaa haal kuch aisa hi he
 Due to torrential rains in Rajasthan, Jodhpur has created extremely shocking conditions
 maharashtra main kolhapur samet kai ilaake barish se behaal hai

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) July 11, 2019 Let us know that Kabir Singh has broken many more records with this year becoming the highest grossing film of the year
 film ne uri da sargical strike, bharat, kesari, total dhamal jaisi filmon kaa record tod diya he
 Despite the criticisms, the film has so far remained at the ticket window
 artical 15 ne bhi apni slo and stadi raftaar banaae rakhaa he
 The film Char Sahibzade is a 3D animation film, which depicts the story of the 10th Guru of Sikhs, Govind Singh and his four sons
 film main dikhaaya gaya he ki guru govind singh ke beton ne apane dharm kii raksha ke liye kis tarah bahaduree se ladate hue apni jaan nyochaavar kar di thi
 The film also depicts how both of his younger sons, who were minors, were murdered by the Mughal Empire
 is film kii kahani itihaas ke pannon se uthaai gai he
 But we are not talking about its research or religious aspect, but are examining it like a film
 3di anemeshan main bani yah film takneekee taur par acchhee he
 In many places in the darkness of the cinema hall, the arrow that appears from the command in the battlefield appears to penetrate the chest
 film ke anemated kirdaaron ko bhi bakhubi utraa gaya he, jisamen imoshan bhi mahasoos ho rahaa tha
 The screenplay of the film was tight, which does not bore you
 film main dilari, bahaduree, kaum or dharm ke liye jajba he
 3 stars from my side to the film
 lodha group ne mumbai main nau din main 500 karod ke flats bech die hai
 These flats belong to the 'world One Tower' project, which is in South Central Mumbai
 project puraa hone ke teen saal baad 29 november ko in flats kii booking shuru kii gai thi
 This is a 117 floor project of the company
 lodha group ke managing diarector abhishek lodha ne kaha, 'teen saal ke baad booking ko dobaaraa sirf kuch samay ke liye shuru kiya gaya
 But even in such a short time, we had 500 crore bookings till 29 November
 'in lagjri flats kii booking 14 disambar tak band ho jaaegi
 75 percent civil construction of this project has been completed
 yah project 2016 tak puraa ho jayega
 The project was announced in 2010 by the Lodha Group
 shuruyaat main diarectorat jeneral of civil avinshan (dijisie) ne suraksha ke maddenjar is project kaa virodh kiya tha
 The company claims that there is no interruption in the project now and it will be completed on time
 ye lagjri flats 3 se 4 biechake ke hai or isaki keemat 70,000-80,000 rupee prati square feet he

 Women will be separated from their children if caught illegally entering the US
 america raashtrapatidonald trampake prashasan se jude teen adhikariyon ne is tarah ke prastaav kii pushti kii he
 They reported that women who are trying to enter the United States illegally with their children
 unako america ke homeland suraksha vibhaag ke prastaav ke mutabik alag karaayaa ja saktaa he
 The reason for this proposal is to prevent mothers from entering the US with children
 jab tak mata-pita apane nirvaasan ke khilaaf ladate hai tab tak sarkaar ke paas unhen hiraasat main rakhane kaa adhikaar hoga
 With this, the children will be kept safely in the Department of Health and Human Services until they can be taken to an American relative or guardian given by the state
 vartmaan nitrubhi jitne bhi parivaar vaale nirvaasan ke khilaaf lard rahe hai, yaa phir jo sharan ke liye aavedan kar rahe hai
 Policies are easy for them
 jab tak cese kaa nateeja nahin aa jaataa tab tak ve america main rah sakate hai
 Democrats oppose the proposal, Texas Democrat Henry Cuyler has opposed this proposal
 unke jile main mexico seemaa kaa 320 kimi ilaaka aata he
 He says, 'it is wrong to separate children from their mothers
 ye maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan he
 From October 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017, 54 thousand children have been arrested
 pichley saal kii tulana main yah sankhya lagbhag dugani he
 'congressional Republicans argue that women are also willing to take such a dangerous journey
 kyonki unako yakeen he ki ve hiraasat se chhot jaaengi
 Or it will take years before a court hearing
 jabaki apravasi adhikaar ke vakeelon kaa kahana he ki kendriya america ke hinsa or garibi ke halaat, mahilaon ko sanyukt rajya kii taraf palaayan karne ke liye majaboor karte hai
 Therefore they should be given a place of refuge
 kanoonee vichaarrashtriya apravasana kanoon centre kii kaaryakari nideshak merilana hinasepi kaa kahana he ki is nai niti ko lagu karnaa, logon ko jindagi bhar ke liye aghat dena he
 Especially those children who have just taken this risky journey from Central America
 hinasepi kaa yah bhi kahana he ki sarkaar ko is policy ko lagu karne se avrajan or parivaar kanoon ke aadhaar par kanoonee chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Obamaprashasan also implemented a policy in this context
 jisamen bacchon or mahilaon ko reeha karne se pehle, unhen parivaar hiraasat kendron main 21 din se zyada nahin rakhaa ja saktaa

 Exit poll results in Uttar Pradesh are indeed a precedent
 pradhanmantri modi kii lahar ko samajhane or aankane ke liye desh kii satta ke baad upi hi satta kaa sabase bada centre mana jaataa he
 The elections to the UP Assembly are considered to be the semi-finals of the General Election and the exit poll results indicate that PM Modi's magic from the 2014 final is intact in this semi-final
 shaayad agle final tak bhi barkaraar rahe
 Since the formation of the government with a strong majority in the growing graph-lok Sabha elections of PM Modi, this magic of Modi has been increasing in almost every election
 iskaa saboot hai chunaav-dar-chunaav badhata bijepi kaa graph
 From east to west, north to south, lotus fed on every side
 bijepi ke is svarnim kaal kaa sehara bandhata he pradhanmantri modi ke sir par
 If 'good days' in the exit poll change the results of the exit poll, then BJP will capture three out of 5 states
 india today exis maai india ke agsit pole ke mutabik sirf upi hi nahin, 70 siton vaale uttarakhand main bhi bijepi ko 46 se 56 siten milane kaa anumaan he to 40 seat vaale goa main bijepi ko 18 se 21 seat milane kaa anumaan he
 It seems as if after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the whole country is getting wet from state to state Modi wave
 loktantr or siyasat main ye kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin he, kyonki satta ke saath hi shuru ho jaati he anti inakambansee kii lahar
 But Modi's magic also destroyed this grammar of politics and not just this grammar, the Modi wave overturned the presumption of the big giants, also demoralizing the effect of demonetisation
 notebandi ke faisle ne chaunkaayanotbandi piem modi kaa aitihaasik faisla tha
 The opposition used this decision fiercely against the government
 bade-bade arthshaastriyon tak ne ise khatarnaak faisla mana
 But it is also no wonder that after demonetisation, Modi's magic from local body to assembly elections not only persisted, but kept growing
 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad jin-jin rajyon main chunaav hue unamem dilli or bihar ko chhod kar bijepi ko har jagah badi kamyaabi mili
 In Haryana and Jharkhand, the BJP formed the government with its own strength, for the first time, the BJP was led by the BJP in Maharashtra
 jammu-kashmir main pehali baar party sarkaar main ai
 bjp's account opened for the first time in the southern state of Kerala
 to purvottar ke assam main pehali baar bijepi satta main ai
 According to an estimate before the latest exit polls of 5 states, about 43 percent of the country's population was ruled by the BJP and its allies
 ab 5 rajyon ke agsit pole ke mutabik desh kii kareeb 58 fisadi aabaadi par bijepi kaa raaj ho saktaa he
 In the mandate of 'congress mukt Bharat', the wave of PM Modi has uprooted the roots of the Congress, which ruled the country's power for 60 years in less than 3 years
 is maharathi ne siyasat ke tamaam samikarnon ko palat kar rakh diya he
 Wherever Modi goes, despite all the tough decisions
 logon main unke liye deewangi nazar aati he
 Modi's magic is seen crossing the borders of the country and even abroad
 din main 18 se 20 ghante kaam karne vaale pradhanmantri modi vipaksh ke har waar ko apane haq main istemaal karne kaa hunar bhi bakhubi jaanate hai
 Opponents are also surprised to see the personality of Modi constantly growing with every face, because the more Prime Minister he is, the more powerful he becomes

 Had declared himself unfit

 Sibal tweeted, 'which BJP leader stood up and publicly advised the Prime Minister and his party to stop treating the opposition and its leaders as villains?'
