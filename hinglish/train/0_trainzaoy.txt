 The same thing happened on Friday when AAP leader Ashish Khaitan, during a press conference on Friday, gave 2 reasons, alleging that the information about the announcement of demonetisation was already leaked

 CM Arvind Kejriwal told on 12 November after demonetisation that in September this year, 4 lakh crore rupees were deposited in many banks, which is black money
 iske jawaab main vitt mantri ne daleel di ki wo sara paisa 7wein vetan ayog ke tahat kiye gaye 45 hajaar karod rupee ke bhugtan kaa asar tha

 Apart from this, Saumakanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor of State Bank of India, in a report released by SBI in March this year, wrote that very soon the old notes will be closed, due to which some people can change their black money either gold or Started converting into dollars

 The Aam Aadmi Party has questioned the policies of the government and asked that if someone who deposits two and a half lakh rupees in the account is sent to his house or shop and then how many women of the house in his wardrobe The government is keeping an eye on jewelery
 lekin duusari taraf notebandi se thik pehle bainkon main 4 lakh karod rupaya jamaa karke use safed kar liya jaataa he to sarkaar isaki jaanch karaane ko kyon taiyaar nahin he? Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday while addressing Border Security Force personnel at Munabav Border Outpost of Barmer on indo-pakistan border, warned Pakistan that India never invades anyone

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh praised the courage of the soldiers that the way the farmer commits his life to protect his field
 usee tarah seemaa suraksha bal ke jawan bhi desh kii hifaazat main jute hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who reached Munabav on a day-long visit, encouraged the soldiers during the military conference and said that it is a matter of great pleasure that the security arrangements on the border are satisfactory
 unhone javaanon kii samasyaayein jaanane ke saath kendra sarkaar kii ore se harsambhav madad karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 Earlier, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh was given the Guard of Honor

 bhopal jail brake or phir 8 simi aatankiyon ke encounter ke baad har roj kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase ho rahe hai
 The documents that have been attached to the hands of 'aaj Tak' clearly show that the soldiers who were deployed in the security of the Central Jail, were posted in the duty of the Chief Minister along with the top officers on the day of the incident
 bhopal encounter maamle main har din chaunkaane vaale tathy saamne aa rahe hai
 On the one hand, questions are being raised about SIMI terrorists escaping from the prison locks by jumping 30 feet high, while it has now been revealed that most of the soldiers deployed in the security of the jail were stationed in the event
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud dastavejon se saaf pataa chalata he ki ghatana ke vakt jail suraksha main tainaat kiye gaye 80 sipaahi viviipi duty main kahaan-kahaan tainaat kiye gaye the
 According to the documents, 1-1 jawan's duty was imposed in CM House and Deputy Secretary Chief Minister's office
 pramukh sachiv ke bangale main jahaan 10 sipaahiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha, vahiin rajya ke gelmantri ke bangale main 4 sipaahi tainaat the
 Two Deputy Inspector General's bungalows and 17-17 soldiers were stationed at the prison headquarters
 vahiin rajya ke do purv jail mantriyon ke bangalon main bhi sipaahiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha
 The Jail Department itself believes that 50 of the 250 posts of security personnel in the Bhopal Central Jail are vacant
 vahiin 70 jawan vibhinn training main hai
 In such a situation, putting 80 soldiers on VIP duty raises a question mark over the safety of the jail
 dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki ghatana ke vakt bhopal central jail main kaid lagbhag 3 hajaar kaidiyon kii suraksha main mahaj 30 se 35 sipaahi hi tainaat the
 It is worth noting that in October, the jail administration had given security warning to DGP and other top officials of the state and demanded armed security personnel
 jise rajya sarkaar or police mahakme ke adhikariyon ne darkinar kar diya tha
 In such a situation, now the list of VIP duty is seen to open the seriousness of the Shivraj government's prison security

 In Aaj Tak's 'operation Aam Aadmi', you saw how the business of bribery is going on indiscriminately in all government departments of Delhi
 iskaa turant hi yah asar hua ki teen adhikari suspend ho gaye or unke khilaaf mukadmaa bhi darj ho gaya
 But the impact of Aaj Tak was seen on the second day
 tamaam sarkari daftaron main adhikari rishwat ke naam se hi dare hue hai
 In 'operation Aam Aadmi Part 2', see how the officers are very scared
 bhrashtachar kii jang ladne vaali aam aadmi party jab satta main ai, to aisa lagane laga ki dilli main rishwat kaa khel khatm ho chukaa he
 After Arvind Kejriwal's arrival, the bribery bureaucracy of Delhi will probably succumb to the AAP
 lekin ajtak kii khufia team jab rishwat kaa reality test karne dilli ke daftaron main nikali, to camera bhi chaunk uthaa
 Yes, when Bangaru Lakshmana Style officials took money above the table and kept green notes in their drawers, the open game of Delhi was in front of everyone
 somvaar kii raat jab ajtak ne oparation aam aadmi main yah dikhaaya ki kaise dilli ke daftaron main bhrashtachar kaa dhandha dhadlle se chal rahaa he, to pehle to sarkaar bhi thithak gai
 But after some time when Kejriwal understood the urgency of the occasion, the AAP government declared a war against bribery on Aaj Tak itself
 manish sisodiya ke tevar dekhne laayak the
 Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal summoned Delhi officials overnight in his office and ordered them to immediately suspend the bribe officers and babus seen on camera
 yahi nahin, kejariwal ne dilli jal board ke 800 karmchaariyon ke bhi tabadale kaa fori aadesh jari kar die
 There was a stir from Kejriwal's house to the Chief Minister's office
 subah hote-hote kejariwal ne apni tarkash se ek or tir nikaala
 He told the Anti Corruption Bureau that without taking any time, he should file a case against the officials taking bribe on camera
 darasal kejariwal bhrashtachar ko hi apni sarkaar kaa trump card maanate hai
 Therefore, he does not want to let this hand get out of his hand
 idhar, ajtak kii team ne rishwat kaa ek or reality test karne mangalvaar ko dilli ke daftaron par dobaaraa dastak di
 Call it the impact of Aaj Tak or Kejriwal's havoc, on Tuesday morning, snakes sniffed corruption in Delhi's offices
 ajtak kii khufia team mangalvaar ko aarake puram sthit imployament exange offis main pahunchi
 To get his name already registered there, he told the babu of the office, so the effect of Aaj Tak's sting operation could be read clearly on his tongue and face
 rojgaar exange offis ke adhikari ne kaha, 'tumhaari to naukari lagi nahin, meri naukari lene par kyon tule ho
 Kejriwal measured three-three officers
 
 'aaj Tak's team also reached the Delhi Jal Board office, one of whose officers was caught in our intelligence camera taking a hefty amount of bribe
 lekin ab vahaan kaa najaara badal chukaa he
 There too, the same cry that three to three nap was lost, now it is not enough to stop bribery
 
 
 aisa koun-sa artio hoga, jahaan daftar ke baahar mandaraate hue dalal aapako mil nahin jaaen
 But when Aajtak's intelligence team reached outside Saket's RTO on Tuesday, the shopkeeper sitting there started crying about the changed atmosphere
 dukandaar ne ajtak ko bataaya ki somvaar kii ghatana ke baad ajtak kii khabar kaa aisa asar hua ki ab yahaan bhrashtachar par maano jhaadu phir gaya he
 The shopkeeper outside the RTO confessed, 'all the brokers have disappeared from here
 yahaan bhrashtachar par jhaadu lag gaya'
 Operation of Anti Corruption Branch
 
 
 reality test na sirf dilli sarkaar ke daftaron main jaakar liya gaya, balki dilli main bhrashtachar kii jaanch karne vaali anti karpshan branch kaa bhi test liya gaya
 The Anti Corruption Branch of the police in Delhi is one such department where till now the files were dusting and most of the officers were sitting without work
 lekin oparation aam aadmi kaa asar yah dikhaa ki suspend adhikariyon ke khilaaf isi branch main mukadmaa darj ho gaya
 One of its senior officers confessed in Aaj Tak's 'operation Aam Aadmi Part 2' how the branch has been alerted and is going to start working day and night against corruption
 dilli vidhansabha ke paas he anti karpshan branch kaa mukhyalay
 The office of the Delhi Government, where every file of corruption is opened, tested and investigated
 oparation aam aadmi main fanse adhikariyon par mukademe bhi isi branch main darj hue hai
 In order to bring transparency against corruption, Aajtak's undercover reporters also came inside this office with an intelligence camera
 aage kii kahani anti karpshan beuro ke asisi balavant singh se suniye
 
 
 He said, 'we are investigating this matter
 ham logon kii team bad rahi he
 It is a CD, people will be arrested in it
 'dilli main AAP kii sarkaar ke aane par balavant singh ne kaha ki kejariwal se pehle is daftar kii koi sud nahin letaa tha
 But after the arrival of Kejriwal, officers are also being deployed here
 ab to asipi bhi din or raat, donon vakt kaam karenge
 It is really hard to know the heart of Delhi sometimes
 ek taraf oparation aam aadmi se afasaron main hadakamp he, to duusari taraf dilli sarkaar ke kuch mahakme aise bhi hai, jahaan kejariwal ke elaan ke baad bhi bhrashtachariyon kii kaan par jun tak nahin rengi
 One of the largest hospitals in the Delhi government is the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital
 yahaan par marij ko daakhil karaane ke liye dallalon kii bheed ab bhi jamaa he
 Without giving any money, there can be a problem in getting injected here
 ab halaat badal rahe hai
 But a long way will have to go for a corruption-free Delhi

 darasal, thode hi din pehle shivpal yadav ne akhilesh yadav se kaha tha ki vah mulaayam ko rashtriya adhyaksh banane kaa vaada puraa karen, jise lekar akhilesh yadav se ek patrkaar ne sawaal kiya
 Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Uttar Pradesh's former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today got angry at a journalist for questioning his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav's statement about handing over the party's command to SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav
 hua yun ki ek tivi channel ke varisht samvaadadaata ne shivpal ke ek bayaan ke bare main sawaal poocha to akhilesh ne halke kesaria rang kii shart pahane samvaadadaata kaa naam lete hue kaha- ‘‘yah abhi nae aae hai
 Their color is also slightly saffron type

 uske baad tay kar lenaa ki phir mere parivaar vaale maamle par koi sawaal nahin poochhoge
 "he said to the reporter in a rather uncomfortable comment"
 
 Let there be politics
 desh barabaad ho jayega to aap kahin nahin miloge
 The country is ruining because of people like you
 ’’ The reporter had asked the SP president that senior members of the party and his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav are repeatedly making statements that Akhilesh had promised before the last assembly election that he would retain all the rights of the party president as well as his post after the election
 The father will hand over the party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and hence he should return to the post of president

 The group stage of FIFA Earlde released in Russia is over

 However, before the final clash, important World Cup teams may face difficulties due to a FIFA rule
 darasal, final kaa lanbaa rasta tay karne se pehle kuch star khilaadiyon ke nilamban kaa khatra he
 Players who are at risk of suspension include star names such as Argentina's Leonel Messi, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Brazil's Neymar
 kya he fifa kaa niyam?fifa world cap toornament ke niyam ke mutabik - "quarter final se pehle yadi khilaadiyon ko do yelo card dikhaaya jaataa he to unhen agle ek match ke liye nilambit kar diya jayega
 If they are booked for the second time by the referee after the Yadikwarter final, they will be suspended from the semi-finals
 iskaa matlab he ki koi bhi khilaadi nilamban ke khatre ke saath semifinal main nahin janaa chahega, jo unhen final match se hi nilambit kara de
 According to news agency IANS, "argentina's star player Lionel Messi was shown a yellow card against Nigeria for wasting time in the last minutes in a group match
 mesi ke alaava argetina ke paanch or khilaadiyon ko yelo card mil chukaa he
 Messi may now have to sit out against Portugal in the quarter-finals if they also get a yellow card against France in the knockout

 He used to send bombs, sometimes gunpowder, sometimes executioner from across that to make it Jahannam

 So now they started sending powders, tablets and injections from across that so that through this paradise, they need to be like cancer, they hold the residents of this paradise in their drug trap

 These poplar shadows on the forests

 yaheen thahar jaaiye
 
 tham jaaiye
 Do not proceed kyonki ruh ko itminan dene vaale surur
 The feeling of drunkenness and intoxication is just here
 iske aage is jananath main kai jagah jahannam kaa daravaaza khulata he
 Where the poisonous winds come from
 magar is jananath main jahannam kii hawa ghola kisne
 Who is he who is trying to get away from this firdous? agar firdaus bar-rou-e-zameen astahamin ast o hameen ast o hameen astazamin par hi jananath dekhni he to wo yahi he
 That is, it has been called the paradise of the land
 magar is jananath kaa ek nasha or bhi he
 First Punjab and now Jammu and Kashmir
 sarhad paar yani pakistan se aanevaali nashe kii khep ab yahaan ke logon kii ragon main zehar gholne lagi he
 Along with the youth, women are also getting addicted
 sawaal ye he ki isse pehle ki halaat puri tarah se beqaabu ho jaaen, kya jammu-kashmir ko barbaad hone se bachaaya ja saktaa he?khubasurat vaadiyon or pahaado se ghire jammu kashmir soobe main haalat kitni khataranaak he, ye ground zero main pahunch kar hi samajha ja saktaa he
 Hundreds of people are addicted
 or is nashe kaa ek bada hissaa pakistan se taskari kar yahaan tak laayaa jaataa he
 To find out this shocking reality of Jammu and Kashmir, Aaj Tak team has reached Udhampur, this hill town six hundred kilometers from the capital Delhi
 bheed bhare bazaar, ghani bastiyon or rihaayshi ilaaqon ke bich ham is baat kii toh lenaa chaahate hai ki akhir nashili chizein yahaan logon ko kis tarah aahista-aahistaan biimaar kar rahi he
 The story of a 23-year-old boy is also surprising
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki wo ladkaa heroin jaisi khataranaak drug kaa aadi he or ab nashe kii jaal se baahar aane kii koshish kar rahaa he?is noujvaan kii kahani apane-aap main baichaiyn to karti he
 But this discomfort increases when you come to know that the elder brother of this young man has also been under the influence of drugs for the last ten years
 kai log vahaan saalon se drugs le rahe hai
 How and how this drug dominates the mind and heart can be understood from the fact that it is willing to go to any extent for a small dose of intoxication
 kisi bhi had tak matlab kisi bhi had tak! usee kii maane to usne isse baahar aane kii koshish bhi kii, lekin aas-paas ke ilaake main ghoomte drug padlers yani nashe ke saudagar use aisa karne nahin dete
 He is troubled by this habit of his intoxication, but seeing this problem of himself and others like him, he agrees to talk to us
 lekin is shart ke saath ki ham uski pahchaan zaahir nahin hone denge
 He says that he is also afraid of his dishonor in society and is also at risk from drug dealers
 lekin yahaan baat sirf ekaadh-logon kii nahin, puure ke puure parivaar kii he
 Drug addiction has devastated many families in Jammu and Kashmir
 ab ek pita ke bare main jaaniye
 How difficult it is to get out of it once drunk, hardly anyone can tell it better than these
 nashe se paar paane kii koshish main inhone doctoron kii madad to lee, lekin ilaaj kaa koi khaas nateeja nahin niklaa, ulta zindagi bhar kii kamai dawaaon main nikal gai
 Family business worth over 70 lakh rupees was destroyed

 The narrator, Ashutosh Bharadwaj's Naxal diary, evolves from the definitions of development and civilization to the fear-violence of the areas of the villages and towns which in the official language are called Naxal-affected areas

 pahaad or jangal ke bich atake kisi kasbe kaa bich sitambar
 - You come in free time, what will you be able to talk here in court
 - shaam ko aap free hongi?- raat nau baje kareeb chalegaa
 
 
 
 ? offis hi aa jaayiyegaa
 Click here to read the second installment
 She is investigating a major case
 naam bhar suna tha
 Very strict, intelligence has been collected within a few days
 raat bhar bitha abhiyukt or sandigdh vyaktiyon se tafteesh karti he
 Today, at the hearing of the case in court, a twenty-twenty-two innocent girl dressed in blue salwar-suit was shocked when she saw the gunman coming among the policemen
 lekin asal chaunkna raat uske offis main hona tha
 On entering the cabin, i saw a man sitting in front of him
 maaloom tha vah cese se jude kuch logon se lambii poochtacha kar rahi he, na maaloom kyon laga ki yah unamem se hi ek he, vahi aadmi jisase main phone par baat kar chukaa tha
 It became a bit uncomfortable as soon as i thought it could be him
 asahaj hone kii ek vajah yah bhi ki sochaa tha is vakt usase fursat main baat ho sakegi cese ke bare main
 - Sit
 
 Tell what you were saying in court
 maine us aadmi kii ore ishaara kiya, vah meri hichak samaj gai
 Started a case-related matter himself, hinting me not to worry about the man
 ham khulte gayi
 The Naxalites kept talking about the fear that the policemen are living in, just a little lapse will be given to Qatar
 us sandigdh vyakti kii tafteesh ke bare main bhi baat hui jise main der tak apane bagal main baitha insaan hi samajhataa rahaa tha
 What has been questioned with him, what is left
 kya saamaan haath laga he, kya bachaa he
 Told about himself
 haal hi police main ai he, yah uskaa pehla cese
 Absolutely firm that the punishment will remain
 apni si hansi
 Very own tone
 pehali kist padhane ke liye yahaan clic karencbin kii diwaar par krime ricard kaa chart tanga tha, jile kaa ek bada sa nakshaa bhi jisamen laal, hare kai nishaan bane the
 While speaking, the pen stuck in his fingers kept moving
 kabhi pen kaanch ke gilaas par takatakaane lagata
 i forgot that someone is sitting next to me, it seems a little strange in the middle when the issue becomes a little more intelligence that someone is listening to us
 lekin pal main bephikr ho jaataa, jab vah hi is aadmi kaa khyaal nahin kar rahi to mujhe kya
 Someone must be a policeman
 - aap baithiye, do minute main aayi bas
 Now that man and i - in that cabin
 uski aankh jhuki hui, shaayad apane juute kii nonk nigaah se tatolta tha
 Then the same worm started dancing and dancing
 kya yah vahi he jisase us din phone par baat hui thi, jise yah ladki gher-ghaar kar poochtacha karti he? chupake se mobile main uskaa number milaayaa
 His mobile home kept on the vibration mode on the table
 dilli main tuji cese ke dauraan manovaigyanik dawaab banane ke sibiai ke tareekon ke bare main sunate the, wo the, lekin sibiai ke shaatir parinde
 Leaving the hair loose, tied with a rubber band, this girl kept opening this man's pole for half an hour, provoking me to curse it, unaware i sat next to it and kept on singing it
 awwal ki yah iskaa pehla cese!
 One reason for the Naxal problem is that the police are considered to be excesses, it should also be thought that how the fear of Naxalism is changing the nature of the policemen

 chunki yah desh kaa sabase adhik naksal-prabhavit rajya he, atharah main se das jile naksaliyon ke garh, baaki kai jilon main bhi unki upasthiti, naksal-hinsa main hui desh kii chhattis pratishat se bhi adhik mrityu is rajya main, isaliye jaahir he vicitra lafj hawa main udate hai
 This child, for example, has entered the police cordon at Cheetah Hospital
 das saal kaa mahaj, sabane andekha kar diya or vah ward main andar aa us ‘naksali’ ke bistar ke bagal main ja khadaa hua he
 Suddenly a soldier is noticed, who is this wearing a shirt-necker
 ‘baahar sab kah rahe the, andar naksali bhartee he
 Came to see ' bachche ko nahin maaloom is par rajdroh samet kai cese hai, use sirf itnaa pataa he yah vah he, jiske bare main sabhi baat karte hai lekin jise vah abhi tak nahin dekh paaya he
 In Raipur, where their presence is relatively low, people are often seen asking such questions
 'aap to vahaan ho aaye hai
 How are those people? kisi kaa drudh vishwaas he ‘naksali log raat main hi paye jate hai
 One reason for this is that in Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, where there is middle class and urban support for the Naxalite movement, almost no in this state
 jadavapur vishvavidhyalay or andhra ke kalege main unki upasthiti shashakt rahi he, das saal kii hinsa ke baad bhi yahaan kisi chaatr union main unki bhagidaari nahin, kuchhek apwaad ke sivaay ve jangal, pahadiyon or gaanv tak hi kendrit he
 a major reason for this is the Naxalites' biological legislation different from Bengal in this state and the specific nervous system of this state itself

 Even Yaksha questions are not available to understand this Abuja

 Death - no accidental accident, vigilant death, careful death - and the elements of novel writing are the same

 According to 50-year-old Yogendra Yadav, who is considered the party's think tank, "to try, make mistakes, add to the opportunity during the campaign and keep correcting mistakes" has been the core of aap's election campaign
 isi mantra kii badaulat haal hi vajood main ai party ne rashtriya swaroop hasil kar liya he

 police ne maukey par jaakar laash ko kabje main le liya
 Police found that Reshma had beating and bruises on her body

 During investigation, it was revealed that Irfan had second marriage with Reshma
 isse pehle bhi uski shaadi ho chuki thi
 He also has two children
 is vaardaat ke baad se irfan or bachche bhi laapata hai
 Therefore, on the complaint of Reshma's maternal uncle, the police have registered a case of murder against her husband Irfan and her son Momin

 Giving clarification on the current situation of GST, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that at the beginning of major economic reforms, one feels sorry but it can be overcome by trying
 india today hindi ke sampadak anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki “jiesti kaa rajasav sangrah lakshya se milon dur he or khajaanon kaa haal khasta he
 If the government had started with a GST with two tax rates from the beginning, then the matter was different, but now the complexity has been created
 ”kyon nahin jude chote kaarobaaripradhanmantri ne daawa kiya ki jiesti chote kaarobaariyon ke liye chunauti isliye laayaa kyonki tex kaa yah krantikari dhaancha puri tarah se technology par aadhaarit tha
 Therefore, resorting to technology for the unorganized business of the country has not proved so easy
 darasal kendra sarkaar ne jiesti lagu karne se pehle daawa kiya tha ki is tex sudhaar ke baad kendra sarkaar ko prati maah kii dar se 1 lakh karod rupee kaa rajasav milegaa
 18 months have passed since GST was implemented and every month the GST system is missing the magic figure
 anshuman tiwari kehete hai ki “jiesti ab keval bade nirmaataa or seva pradaata (jo pichhali pranali main bhi pramukh karadaata the) ke kar yogadan par chal rahaa he
 Small taxpayers and newly registered businesses have returned to the old pattern of tax evasion with the help of concessions
 ”18 maheene baad bhi launch nahin hua jiesti kaa khaas tantra1 july 2017 ko aadhi raat se puure desh main chaar dar (5,12,18,28 fisadi) vaala jiesti lagu kiya gaya
 But since its implementation, dozens of changes have been made in GST
 kai badlaavon main agar kaarobaari ko riyaayat dene kii kavayad hui to kuch badlaavon se aam aadmi par boj ko kam karne kii koshish kii gai
 But did the business and the common man benefit from these exercises? Suspense remains intact on this question
 anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki “jiesti main riyaayaton ke baad utpaadon yaa sevaaon kii keemten kam hui bhi hai kyonki companiyaan laagat badaae ke kaaran mulya badha rahi hai
 The mechanism to stop profiteering under GST is yet to be introduced, so that who has benefited from the concessions
 ”tiwari ne kaha ki “jiesti main abhi ausatan 60 fisadi kaarobaari ritern bhar rahe hai
 Expectations of transparency have also come after the implementation of the e-bill

 Jaitley claimed that this would discourage the blackmarket economy and help transform the informal economy into a formal economy

 jiesti desh kaa sabase bada kar sudhaar he or isse vastu evam sevakar ke kshetra main ahm badlaav dekhne ko milenge

 tex vibhaag hoga chustavitt mantri ne daawa kiya tha ki vah iskar vibhaag samet rajasav main lage vibhaagon ko itnaa majboot banane kaa prayaas hoga
 According to Jaitley, the way of functioning of these departments will go completely with the help of technology where there will be no possibility of burglary
 vahiin technology ke chalate kaarobaari or tex vibhaagon main sathganth kii sambhaavna bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 5
 jiesti banegaa duniya kaa sabase best tex systamakendra sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki jiesti se apratyaksh karon ke kshetra main jatil kar pranali behad saral or paardarshee ho jaaegi
 Due to this, the tax system of the country will become the simplest system in the world

 The lack of coordination among the leaders is directly impacting the campaign

 Even though there is no quarrel between the leaders on the surface in the Delhi BJP, there is a clear contradiction between the statements and the mutual tussle in their respective campaign
 kyonki siem ummidavaar dow harshavardhan war room main baithkar ladaai lard rahe hai or vijay goyal apni padayatra shuru kar chuke hai
 However, leaders seem to be avoiding the direct answer to this question

 dow harshavardhan kehete hai, ‘sab ek saath jaaenge, to aapako takalif hogi ki sab ek saath gum rahe hai, koi talmail kii kami nahin he sab ek saath hai or party ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 'for fear of the high command, the leaders are not saying anything openly, but the emphasis is that in Delhi politics we are no less than anyone
 alaakaman ko phikr is baat kii he ki dilli main bijepi 15 saal se satta se baahar he or netaa aapas ke hisaab-kitaab main lage hai
 In such a situation, fear is also prevailing that the party's electoral politics may not be submerged again

 Under which law the three parties have reached the Supreme Court directly, the hearing under Article 32 on the violation of fundamental rights Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have approached the Supreme Court against the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra

 Now today the bench of three justices, headed by Supreme Court Justice NV Ramana, is hearing the case
 is bench main justise ashok bhushan or justise sanjeev khanna bhi shaamil hai
 Now the question here is, under which law did the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP reach the Supreme Court directly? Can common people also knock the doors of Supreme Court directly like Shiv Sena Congress and NCP? Violation of Fundamental Rights, Article 32 Senior Advocate of Supreme Court Pradeep Kumar Rai in this case says that all citizens are given fundamental rights in the Constitution Huh
 agar kisi ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hota he, to vah anuchhed 32 ke tahat sidhe supreme court aa saktaa he or rit pitishan file kar saktaa he
 He also said that this right does not belong to the juristic person ie the company or any organization
 agar koi juristic person anuchhed 32 ke tahat supreme court jaataa he, to uski yachika khaarij ho sakati he
 This is because the juristic person does not have the same fundamental rights as the natural person
 juristic person ko sirf kanoonee adhikaar hote hai
 In response to a question, Pradeep Kumar Rai, a member of the Executive Committee of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said that Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have filed writ petition in the Supreme Court under Article 32 on the basis of violation of fundamental rights found under Article 14
 
 yah is tarah kaa pehla maamla nahin he, isse pehle bhi kai aise maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 He said that recently there was a lot of ruckus in Karnataka about the formation of the government after which the Supreme Court had heard the matter
 karnataka maamle main supreme court ne floor test kaa aadesh diya tha
 Pradeep Kumar Rai, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court also stated that under Article 14 of the Constitution all persons have been treated as equal in the eyes of the law and equal protection of the law has been provided
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki sabhi par ek samaan kanoon lagu honge
 Nobody will be discriminated against
 agar kisi ke saath bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he to yah us vyakti ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan mana jaataa he
 He said that if someone's fundamental rights are violated, then that person can knock the door of the Supreme Court directly under Article 32
 unhone bataaya ki sirf moulik adhikaron ke hanan par hi anuchhed 32 ke tahat supreme court jaaya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the High Court can also be moved under Article 226 in case of violation of fundamental rights

 Filmmaker Anwar Jamal said, 'gurudutt's storytelling ability was unique and he set the standard in producing crime thriller films
 unki filmon main kahani kii kai tahen dikhaai detii hai or vah saamaajik raajnneetik paridrishy ko samajhakar film banane waalon main se the
 Nothing is found in his films unnecessarily
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aajkal krime thriller ko kaaphi sankuchit or bhadda bana diya gaya he, jo dekhne main bhunda evam vibhats sa lagata he
 Looking at the current environment, it seems that if Guru Dutt were alive today, he would have made a 'political thriller'
 ’unhone kaha ki gurudutt isliye maanak tay kar sake kyonki us daur main sahitya, sangeet, kavita or rachanaatmak paksh se jude logon kaa sambadh cinema se tha or sahitya evam cinema ke bich sambandh ke kaaran hi unki filmon kii kahani sabhi ke saath sambandh sthapit karne main kaamyaab rahati thi
 Jamal said that apart from this, there was a level of understanding of cinema among the general public
 unhone kaha, ‘jo kuch saamne dikhataa he vah film kii kahani nahin ho sakati, iske liye tahen hona behad jaruri he
 'film critic Vinod Bhardwaj said,' Had Guru Dutt apparently would have given many good films to the Hindi film industry
 aamtaur par log ‘pyaasa’ or ‘kaagaj ke phool’ ko unki behtareen film maanate he, lekin meri najar main unki sarvshereshth film ‘sahab bibi or gulam’ thi
 Although officially directed by Abrar Alvi, it was directed by Gurudutt from behind the scenes
 ’unhone kaha ki gurudutt ne shuruuaat main kaaphi acchhee filmon kaa nirmaan kiya or krime thriller filmon ke nirmaan evam nirdesan main vah maanak tay karne vaale filmkaar the
 His made crime thriller films managed to establish a relationship with the common man
 ’nau july 1925 ko bangalore main janme gurudutt ne 'kaagaj ke phool' kii asafalataa or chaudaavin kaa chand kii safalataa par kaha tha, ‘jindagi main, yaar kya he? do hi to chijen he - kamyaabi or naakamayaabi
 There is nothing between these two
 ’ 10 aktubar 1964 main mumbai main apane bistar main rahasyamay sthiti main mrit paye gayi gurudutt ne ek baar kaha tha, ‘dekho na, mujhe nirdeshak bananaa tha, ban gaya
 Had to become an actor, became

 Bankim was offended by the behavior of the British and he composed a song in the year 1876 and titled it 'vande Mataram'

 Despite the decisive participation of this song in the freedom struggle of 30's Messi, Learn Star Footballer's 'sachin Connection' as national song, when it came to the selection of national anthem, songs written and sung by Rabindranath Thakur in place of Vande Mataram Jana Gana Mana was given preference
 isaki vajah yahi thi ki kuch musalamaanon ko 'vande maataram' gane par aapatti thi, kyonki is geet main devi durga ko raashtra ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Apart from this, he also believed that the Anand Math novel from which this song was taken was written against Muslims
 in aapattiyon ke maddenjar saal 1937 main congress ne is vivaad par gaharaa chintan kiya
 The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, which also included Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, found that the first two verses of the song are said to be in praise of the motherland, but later verses mention Hindu deities
 isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya gaya
 In this way, Jana Hee, the Jan-gana-man of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur, was allowed to remain the national anthem as it was and the first two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee with Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha was approved

 Priyanka Gandhi's meeting with Dalit leader and Bhima Army chief Chandrashekhar, Congress general secretary and in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, was like Priyanka's move in the eyes of many to put her hand on the bsp's traumatized eye
 is mulaakaat ke baad basapa pramukh mayawati ne amethi or raibareli main congress ke khilaaf ummidavaar utaarne kaa man bana liya tha, lekin baad main gathbandhan ne is faisle ko philhal ke liye taal diya he
 However, the SP-BSP has decided that if the Congress now hands over the other painful 'shivpal Yadav', then the amethi-rae Bareli coalition can step up to contest in both the seats
 bataa den ki priyanka gandhi wadra ke dalit netaa chandrashekhar aaazaad se buudhvaar ko milane ke fouran baad mayawati or akhilesh yadav kii achaanak hui baithak ne congress ke liye khatre kii ghanti baja di thi
 Annoyed, Mayawati wanted to avenge this by putting her candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli, but for now, the coalition will still contest elections on the old formula
 akhilesh or mayawati ke bich hui meeting main yah baat bhi tay hui ki philhal congress ko 2 siton ke saath gathbandhan kaa hissaa hi kaha jaae
 But the SP-BSP alliance is cautious about the next steps of the Congress and has adopted the strategy of weight and watch
 sapa sutron ne bataaya ki agar congress party ne shivpal yadav se kisi bhi tarah kaa gathbandhan karne kaa faisla karti he to amethi or raibareli kii sansadeey siton par rahul gandhi-sonia gandhi ke khilaaf ummidavaar utaarne ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin bachegaa
 This means that Priyanka Gandhi met Chandrashekhar and laid his hand on the sadness of the BSP
 aise main congress ne shivpal yadav ke saath gathbandhan kiya to amethi or raibareli main bhi congress ko gathbandhan ke ummidavaar jhelane honge
 Actually, Amethi and Rae Bareli have been the strongest strongholds of the Congress
 is baar ke chunaav main amethi main bijepi ne apni puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 In such a situation, the SP-BSP knows that the Congress party cannot afford to take the risk
 party ke netaaon ke mutabik yah koi blackmel nahin balki ranneeti kaa hissaa he or party ne philhal congress ko zyada tavajjo nahi dene kii ranneeti bana rakhi he

 There is hardly any reader of Hindi literature who has not heard the name of Khalil Jibran
 khalil ek umdaa gadhy lekhak hone ke saath-saath ek kavi or ek chitrakaar ke rup main jane gaye
 Translations of his works were done in most of the languages of the world and exhibitions of paintings were also held in many countries
 khalil jibran kaa janm syria desh ke mount lebanon praant ke bashari naamak gaanv main san 1883 main 6 farvari ko hua tha
 He was associated with the Maronite Church denomination
 pita kaa naam khalil or mata kaa naam kamila tha
 He was the first child of his parents and was related to a wealthy family in northern Lebanon
 kehete hai ki vah shuru se hi krantikari vichaaron ke the or apane darshan or chintan ke kaaran unhen samakaleen padariyon or adhikari varg kaa kopbhaajan hona padaa
 Alam is that first Khalil Jibran was expelled from the caste, who later reached the country
 12 varsh kii aayu main vah pehle apane mata-pita ke saath baahar nikle or belgium, france, america aadi deshon main bhraman karte hue antat saal 1912 main america ke neuyork shahar main sthaayee rup se rahane lage
 Khalil Gibran had studied the painting very intensively
 apni sabhi kitabon ke liye chitra unhone khud banaae
 The imprint of the difficulties of his life is also evident in his works
 khalil jibran ne apane jivan main anekon kahaniyon kii rachana kii
 In these stories, he made the basis of subjects like society, individuals, religious hypocrisy, class struggle, love, justice, art, etc
 inaki kahaniyon main paakhand or maanviya laalach ke prati gaharaa vidroh saaf dikhataa he
 Along with this, there is a deep sense of life, sensitivity, emotionalism in his compositions with a sense of satire
 unhone apni rachanaaon main prakritik evam saamaajik vaataavaran kaa chithran kiya
 The biggest feature of Khalil Gibran's literature is that whatever he wrote, he was not for the sake of being bound by the boundaries of the country and was for everyone and for all times
 haalanki unhen aadhunik arabi sahitya main prem kaa sandeshvahak mana jaataa he, par unki samast rachanaaon main saamaajik anyaay ke prati buland awaz milti he
 An entire life philosophy appears in his compositions
 unhen padhakar anubhav hota he ki sansar main vyaapt pidaa or vishmata ke liye swayan manushya jimmedaar he or in buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye manushya ko swayan hi praytn karnaa hoga
 His writing style reflects the imagination of the poet, decency of the artist and sensitivity of the heart
 khalil jibran ke bare main yah charchit he ki unhen har baat kehane ke pehle ek yaa do vaakya sutara rup main, sukhtiyon main kehane kii aadat thi
 Khalil put forth his views in front of his readers in the form of high quality subhashita or proverbs
 kaha jaataa he ki vah apane vichaaron ko kaagaj ke tukdon, theatre kaarykram ke kaagajon, cigarette kii dibbiyon ke gatton tathaa fate hue liphaafon par likhakar rakh dete the
 These were collected by his secretary Barbara Young and later compiled and published
 unki pramukh kritiyon main, da nimphs ov da vaili, sprits rebelius, broken wings, a twor and a smil, da proseshns, da tempests, da storm, da meadman, twanti drawings, da forsionar, da prophet, sand and fom, kingdom ov da imegination, jisas : da san ov main, da arth, gods, da vandarar, da garden ov da prophet, lazaras and hiz billwed shaamil he
 Khalil Gibran was a master of amazing imaginations
 unki rachanaaen 22 se adhik bhartiya bhashaaon jinamein hindi, gujarati, marathi, urdu shaamil he, main anuvaadit ho chuki hai
 He has the most translations in Urdu and Marathi
 vah isa ke anuyaayi hokar bhi padariyon or andhvishwaas ke kattar virdohi rahe
 Although he was expelled from his country, his patriotic spirit was filled with cheering
 unhone maanviya saamaajik vyavhaar par darshan, chintan ke alaava apane desh ke liye bhi likhaa
 He died in New York on April 10, 1931, at the age of 48, being seriously injured in a car accident
 sahitya ajtak kii ore se is mahaan lekhak ko naman! The World Cup quarter-finals between India and Bangladesh continue
 bhartiya captain ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaazi kaa faisla kiya he
 Team India is looking heavy in this case, but there is one aspect which is bothering Team India
 vah pahalu he march kaa maheenaa, kyonki march ke maheene main ab tak bangladesh ne team india kaa do baar boria bistar sametane ke liye majaboor kiya he
 Bangladesh beat India by 5 wickets in the World Cup, played on 17 March in Port of Spain
 is haar ke saath hi bharat 2007 ke world cap main pehle hi round main baahar ho gaya tha
 It was then played on 16 March 2012 between the two teams in the Asia Cup
 muqabla bhi team india bhuuli nahin hogi
 Sachin Tendulkar had completed the hundredth century of his international career in this match, but Team India also lost this match by 5 wickets
 yahaan bhi haarane ke chalate team india ko asia cap se baahar hona padaa tha
 Obviously India are playing first in the quarter-finals and Bangladesh have to play later
 do ahm maukon par baad main khelte hue bangladesh ne ulatpher kar dikhaaya he, ye pahalu team india india ko pareshaan jarur kar rahaa hoga
 Let me tell you, Arvind Kejriwal was involved in the meeting held at the house of NCP leader Sharad Pawar for the opposition's strategy for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 is baithak main pashchim bengal kimukhyamantri mamata banerjee or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi the
 Rahul Gandhi's statement after the meeting indicated that the Congress would contest alone in West Bengal and Delhi
 pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee kii tiemasi or dilli main arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party kii sarkaar he
 Rahul Gandhi had said, 'will also contest against each other
 'mamata banerjee ne elaan kiya tha ki narendra modi ke khilaaf vipakshi dal chunaav se pehle gathbandhan karenge
 However, on the question of alliance in Bengal and Delhi, he said, 'it has not been decided yet
 'delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on opposition alliance: Hamare man mein desh ko leke bahut jyada chinta hai

 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki kaaman minimum program banegaa
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the exercise of the grand alliance of opposition leaders seems to be paying off
 mahagathbandhan se bijepi kii raah mushkil jarur ho jaaegi
 In fact, after the meeting of opposition parties, Rahul Gandhi said that we all agree that we will have a minimum common program
 ham bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye saath kaam karenge
 At the same time, Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee called the opposition meeting meaningful and said that they will make a pre-poll alliance
 vahiin, arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki baatcheet rachanaatmak rahi or ham saath milakar kaam karenge
 The grand alliance leaders are under pressure from the Congress over the alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi that if there is no aap-congress alliance in Delhi, the Opposition may suffer loss
 magar rahul gandhi bhi is baat par sahamat nahin hue hai ki arvind kejariwal kii party se gathbandhan karnaa he yaa nahin
 If sources are to be believed, there is a screw up on seats in Bengal and Delhi for the alliance

 He says that he has a lot of facilities in the private sector
 jabaki sarkari centre par kisaan ko bahut pareshaan kiya jaataa he
 Laws are given so many rules that the farmer does not go to the center again
 bareli jile main bahedi ke rahane vaale kisaan sardaar lokentre singh kehete hai ki sarkari centre main unheen kisaanon kii fasal kii kharidari kii jaati he, jinka panjikrut rahata he
 Not all farmers are registered, so they have to sell vouchers from other registered farmers

 But they prefer to sell their flocks to private agents
 wo kehete hai ki sarkari centre par beche jane ke liye hamen apane paas se bardana jutanaa padataa he
 While we have personal relationships with private agents, they come home and take it themselves
 itnaa hi nahin jarurat padhane par fasal kharid se pehle hi paisa de dete hai
 Whereas the money comes after selling the crop in the government center and sometimes has to wait a long time
 saharanpur ke privet aadhat kaa kaam karne vaale gulzaar ahamed kehete hai ki sarkaar hameshaa fasal katane ke vakt emspi main badhotaree karti he, lekin is baar kaaphi pehle kar di he
 The farmer has already sold his crop
 aise main kharif fasalon kii badi hui keemten kisaanon ko march-april main milengi
 He said that at this time the increase in MSP would benefit the artisans rather than farmers
 sarkaar ke is kadam se bazaar main manhagaai bhi badhegi
 Explain that after the Modi government increased the MSP, the new price of wheat has been increased from Rs 1,735 per quintal to Rs 1,840 per quintal

 So if you are fond of eating chicken, then take a train to Kolkata and eat chicken till the panchayat elections are over
 kyonki is baar mamata banerjee murga khaane waalon par meharbaan ho uthi hai
 The decree has been issued that whoever sold more than Rs 150 a kg is not well
 rajya main chikan 180 rupee se 200 rupee prati kilogram ke bich thi
 According to reports, the Taskforce, which monitors the prices of essential commodities in the state, met last week, in which Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was angered by the rising prices of chicken
 tab mamata ne aadesh diya ki rajya main chikan 150 rupee prati kilo se zyada keemat par nahin bechaa jaae
 a spokesperson of the Taskforce stated that these prices will be applicable to all markets under Kolkata Municipal Corporation
 mamata ne poltrie ke daamon main ho rahi asaamaanya vruddhi kii jaanch ke bhi aadesh die
 Mamta Banerjee's decree is enticing customers from above, but she also fears that if there is pressure to sell cheap chicken, traders can compromise with the quality to get their cost
 duusari ore vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki dedh sau rupee to unki laagat hi pad jaati he, aise main ve vyapaar kaise kar paaenge

 apane purv chairman mistre par palatwaar karte hue company ne kaha he ki tata samooh ke treston kaa sanchaalan jamshedji tata va unke do beton kii vyaktigat vasiyaton se hota he
 Along with this, the company has accused Mistry of causing huge financial losses to the companies
 tata sans 100 arab dollar ke tata samooh kii anshadharak company he jiske chairman pad se mistre ko pichley maheene achaanak hataa diya gaya tha
 Tata Sons has said in a statement that the industrial houses and their companies have suffered huge losses due to the statements of Mistry and 'a huge financial loss of thousands of crores to all the shareholders'
 ' jin companiyon ko nuksaan hua he unamem ve companiyaan bhi shaamil hai jinke chairman mistre abhi bane hue hai
 Tata Sons said in a statement, "the trusts are governed by the personal wills of Jamsetji Tata, his sons Sir Dorabji Tata and Ratan Tata and other founders

 Earlier Cyrus Mistry, intensifying his fight against Tata Sons and Ratan Tata, said on Monday that the Tata group is not a one-man estate and its future depends on the running of trusts of the Tata family

 Mistry was unexpectedly removed from Tata Sons as the chairman of Tata Sons in October, making former chairman Ratan Tata the interim chairman of the company
 uske baad se hi unke or tata sans ke kheme ke bich khinchataan chal rahi he
 Taking a dig at this, Mistry has said that the right to decide should not be given in the hands of one person and all rights should be handed over to one person or 'high command'

 Bali does not forget the beginning of age and the feeling of love first

 When we are in a new stage of age and we feel heartbroken, then the process of meeting begins
 ye silsilaa vaaki bahut sundar hota he, hameshaa jahan main rahane vaala
 If your love is true, then a moment spent with love is printed on the pages of life in non-fading letters
 lekin agar vah rishta mahaj ek hi taraf se jor pakad rahaa he, to yah to tay he ki ek na ek din kasamasaahat uthaane vaala dard aapako apane kabje main kar legaa
 And you will not be able to get out of it even if you want to
 pyaar ke baad jab rishton main daraaren aati hai or wo is anjaam tak pahunch jaataa he ki use khatm kar diya jaae, to yakeen maniye vah pal jindagi kaa sabase dard bharaa ehsaas hota he jise aap jivan bhar bhul nahin sakate
 While men do not spend much time to get rid of this problem, women take a lot of time
 agar aap bhi aise hi samay se guzar rahi hai, to ab zyada ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin
 We are here to help you
 ham aapako bataaenge ki kaise aap apane toote rishte se tut chuke dil ko sambhaal sakati hai
 So first of all, learn from this relationship
 ise ek paath kii tarah maane, isse rishton kii ahmiyat or sahi galat kii parakh ko samajhen
 So that in future, these things will not spoil any of your relationships
 iske baad apane bheetar is sab se ho rahe badlaav or dard ko sweekaar karen
 Instead of hiding your own shortcomings, review them
 visheshgy hameshaa salaah dete hai ki dil se un bhaawanaaon ko nikaal feken jo aapako rishte ke tut jane kaa ahsaas karaati hai
 It is better to find a good seducing option than being plunged into negativity
 doston se dur bhaagane ke bajaae unase milen
 Take the time to hang out
 apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke saath samay bitaayen
 Further enhancing your inner talent is also a better option
 jo kaam aap karnaa chaahati thim yaa jo aapako pasand he vahi karen
 If you want, join a cooking class or go to a photography institute
 lekin jo bhi karen apane usee puraane lalak ke saath
 Then see how you leave the old broken heart behind in the new year

 aise main agar pakistan kashmir masale ko rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii meeting main uthaata he to aisa nahin hoga ki bharat baatcheet ko khatm kar degaa
 Diplomacy did its job well this time to improve and further the relationship between India and Pakistan
 lekin saajha bayaan ko bharat kii kamyaabi kaa adwitiya jhanda bataane waalon ne pakistan ko bhi apana tevar dikhaane ko majaboor kar diya
 The source rightly said that before the match started, we started telling the result of the last over
 bharat or pakistan ke rishton ko sudhaarney or aage badhaane ke liye diplomasi ne is baar apana kaam bakhubi anjaam diya
 But those who shared the statement as the unique flag of India's success, forced Pakistan to show its attitude

 To give justice to such people who were kept in jail for years after being declared terrorists and were acquitted by the Supreme Court
 inhen main se ek tha mohammad aamir
 Aamir spent 14 years of his life in prison
 wo bhi bina kisi gunaah ke
 Aamir, who hails from Old Delhi, was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police in 1998
 dilli police ne uske khilaaf aisisajeesh rachiki uski jindagi hi kharaab kar daali
 At that time, the police had accused Aamir of being involved in 22 blasts
 lekin kehete hai ki jhooth ke paanv nahin hote
 So the case started to weaken in the court
 police kii karatuut saamne aane lagi
 Due to which Aamir was acquitted from one case after another
 haalanki is dauraan aamir ke pakade jane ke teen saal baad hi uske pita kii sadame se maut ho gai
 His family was completely shattered
 police ne aamir par 1996-97 main dilli, upi or haryana main alag-alag taarikh or vakt par hue 22 dhamaakon main shaamil hone ke ilzaam lagaae gaye the
 He was 18 then
 14 lambey saal jail main kaatane ke baad supreme court ne aamir ko begunaah bataate hue 2014 main use azaad kar diya
 The matter reached the National Human Rights Commission
 police kii sajeesh kaa sach tathyon ke saath ayog ke saamne tha
 The Commission summoned Delhi Police Commissioner and Principal Secretary, taking a tough stand on the matter

 Aaj Tak, the number one channel of the country, put this news prominently in front of the country under its campaign

 Five lakh rupees have reached Aamir's account
 magar kya jail main bitaye aamir ke wo 14 saal koi lautaa saktaa he? New Delhi: Remember, the song of the movie 'chameli' on which you used to beat the beat, 'mana saat samandar dol gaya, which you spoke with eyes, le teri ho gaya ya sajna ve sajna

 The results of the assembly elections in Haryana are coming and it seems as if a spring of clean water has revived in the drying up base of the Congress
 haryana hi sambhavatya saraswati kii bhoomi bhi rahi he
 Kurukshetra and Saraswati river, these two names come in Jehn as soon as Haryana is named
 to aaj ke nadisutra main baat usee saraswati nadi kii, jiske bare main manyata he ki vah gupt rup se prayagraj main sangam main shaamil hoti he
 The same river which used to be very important in Vedic period
 vaise, khabar yah bhi he ki kendriya jalashakti mantralay ne prayagraj main ek aisi sukhi nadi kaa bhi pataa lagaaya he jo ganga or yamuna ko jodatii he
 According to the National Clean Ganga Mission, the purpose of the discovery was to find a potential groundwater recharge source
 is pracheen nadi ke bare main mantralay ne bataaya ki yah 4 kimi chaudee or 45 kimi lambii he or isaki jameen ke andar 15 moti parat maujuud he
 This river was discovered in December last year by CSIR-NGRI (national Geophysics Research Institute) and the Central Ground Water Board during a geophysical aerial survey
 baharhaal, agar yah saraswati he to vah koun si saraswati he jisko haryana or rajasthan main khojane kii koshish kii gai thi? kya saraswati ne bhartiya upmahadweep ke vivartanik plate kii hulchalon kii vajah se apana rasta badal liya? vah nadi kahaan lupt ho gai?aaj se kareeb 120 saal pehle 1893 main yahi sawaal ek angrej ejeeniyar si
 F
 oldham ke jehan main bhi ubhara tha, jab ve is nadi kii sukhi ghati yani ghagghar ke ilaake se hokar gujarey the
 Oldham then gave the first hypothesis that it might not be, it is the valley of the ancient giant river Saraswati, which used to get water from the Sutlej River
 or jise rishi-muniyon ne rugveda (richa 2
 41
 16) main ''ambi tame, nadi tame, devi tame saraswati” arthath sabase badi maa, sabase badi nadi, sabase badi devi kahkar pukaara he
 The description of this terrain in the Rigveda mentions the presence of five rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Vyasa between the Indus in the west and the Saraswati river in the east
 rugveda (richa 7
 36
 6) main saraswati ko sindhu or anya nadiyon kii maa bataaya gaya he
 Regarding the disappearance of this river, Oldham had said that nature changed its course and the waters of Sutlej turned towards the Indus River
 haalanki uske baad saraswati ke swaroop ko lekar ek-duusare ko katati hui kai pariklpanaaen saamne ain
 Satellite images found in the 1990s revealed to the world the rough blueprint of that river for the first time
 in nakshon main kareeb 20 kimi chaudaai main himalay se arab sagar tak jameen ke andar nadi ghati jaisi akruti dikhaai detii he
 Now the question is that no river can flow in such a width, then what was the exact route and size of that river? In order to find answers to these questions, in late 2011, experts from BHU and Imperial College, London, along with IIT Kanpur started research
 india today main hi chhapi khabar ke mutabik, 2012 ke ant main team kaa 'international union of kwateronari research’ ke jarnal kwateronari jarnal main ek shodhpatr chapa
 It was titled: Geo Electric Resistance Evidence for Subsurface Paleochannel Systems Adjacent to Harappan Sites in Northwest India
 isamen daawa kiya gaya: ''yah adhyayan pehali baar ghagghar-hakara nadiyon ke bhumigat jalatantr kaa bhu-bhautikeey (jiophysical) sakshya prastut karata he
 "this paper came out after the completion of the first phase of the plan and it will continue westward in the vanishing Saraswati valley in search of evidence
 pehle sakshya ne to us pariklpana par muhar laga di ki saraswati nadi ghagghar kii tarah himalay kii talahati kii jagah sindhu or sutluj jaisi nadiyon ke udgam sthal yani oonche himalay se nikalati thi
 The study started from the village of Sirhind, far away from the current stream of Ghaggar river and the first results were startling
 sarhind main jameen ke kaaphi neeche saaf pani se bhari ret kii 40 se 50 meter moti parat saamne ai
 This valley is 20 km underground
 iske bich main pani kii maatra kinaaron kii tulana main kahin adhik he
 The special thing is that in Sirhind, there is no such indication on the surface that one can guess that such a big river valley exists below the ground
 balki yahaan to jameen ke thik neeche bahut sakht sataha he
 Such a large amount of water may not be in the tributary but in the main river
 shodhakartaaon ne tab india today kaa bataaya ki yahaan nikle kankadon kii finger printing se yah lagata he ki yah nadi oonche himalay se nikalati thi
 Any 1,000 km
 kii yatra kar arab sagar main girti thi
 Its current can be compared to the present day Ganges River
 sarhind ke is sakshya ne saraswati kii ghagghar se itar swatantra maujuudagi par muhar laga di
 That is, for the first time, the geophysical evidence was affixed to what Oldham had thought about the relationship of Sutlej and Saraswati 120 years ago
 to phir ye nadiyaan alag kaise ho gayi? samay ke saath saraswati nadi ko pani dene vaale glacier suukh gaye
 In these circumstances either the river flow was over or the later rivers like Indus, Sutlej and Yamuna occupied the river's flow area
 is puri prakriya ke dauraan saraswati nadi kaa pani purv disha kii ore or sutluj nadi kaa pani pashchim disha kii ore khisakta chalaa gaya
 Later civilizations developed on the banks of the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna (formerly Chambal)
 pehle yamuna nadi nahin thi or chambal nadi hi baha karti thi
 But the new river Yamuna, near Ponta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh, during the period of turbulence, captured the water source of Saraswati and later on it also got Chambal
 yani saraswati kii sahaayak nadi sutluj uskaa saath chhodkar pashchim main khiskkar sindhu main mil gari or purv main saraswati or chambal kii ghati main yamuna kaa udai ho gaya
 In such a situation, it is emphasized that even though there is no geophysical evidence of the confluence of ganga-yamuna-saraswati in Prayag, the evidence of Yamuna's occupation of Saraswati on the waterway indicates different relationship of these rivers
 udhar, jin mul raaston se hokar saraswati baha karti thi, uske bich main thar kaa marusthal aa gaya
 But the description of the old form of this river is found in the Rigveda
 rugveda ke shloke (7
 36
 6) main kaha gaya he, ''he saatvin nadi saraswati, jo sindhu or anya nadiyon kii mata he or bhoomi ko upjau banaati he, hamen ek saath prachur ann do or apane pani se sinchit karo
 Data based on the sound resistance of IIT Kanpur suggest that the complex structure of the river basin filled with clear water is present near Kalibanga and Munak villages
 in donon jagahon par kiye gaye adhyayan main pataa chalaa ki jameen ke bheetar 12 kimi se adhik chaudee or 30 meter moti mithe pani se bhari ret kii tah he
 Whereas the width of the existing Ghaggar river is only 500 meters and the depth is only five meters
 jameen ke bheetar maujuud mithe pani se bhari ret ek jatil sanrachana dikhaati he, jisamen bahut-si alag-alag dharaaen ek badi nadi main milti dikhti hai
 This complex structure shows a river that existed in a period with more rain and water present than today, or now flows elsewhere due to the division of rivers
 adhyayan aage bataata he ki is mithe pani se bhari ret se upar keechad se bhari ret kii parat he
 The thickness of this layer is about 10 meters
 gaad se bhari yah parat us daur kii ore ishaara karti he, jab nadi kaa pani suukh gaya or uske upar keechad kii parat jamati chali gai
 These two layers are proof that the ancient river flowed in great shape and later dried up
 or in donon ghatnaon ke kahin bahut baad ghagghar jaisi barsaati nadi vajood main ai
 The satellite image shows that the Saraswati valley traveled to Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Anupgarh in Haryana, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, the Thar Desert and then the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat
 rajasthan ke jaisalmer jile main bahut se aise borwell hai, jinase kai saal se apane aap pani nikal rahaa he
 These borewells were dug in 1998 to explore the underground river under the Mission Saraswati Scheme
 is dauraan kendriya bhoojal board ne kishangarh se lekar ghotaaru tak 80 kimi ke kshetra main 9 nalakup or rajasthan bhoojal vibhaag ne 8 nalakup khudwaaye
 The water coming out in the desert is nothing short of a surprise to the people
 nalkupon se nikle pani ko bhabha atomic research centre ne 3,000 se 4,000 saal purana mana tha
 That is, some more exciting information can be found in the coming days
 vaigyanik sakshya or unke ird-gird ghoomte aitihaasik, puratathvik or bhugolic tathy pataal main lupt saraswati kii gavaahi de rahe hai
 However science does not agree with faith in one thing and this disagreement also has very serious meaning
 manyata he ki saraswati lupt hokar jameen ke andar bah rahi he, jabaki iity kaa shodh kahata he ki nadi bah nahin rahi he, balki uski bhumigat ghati main jal kaa bada bhandar he
 If water was continuously drained from the lost river valley through a large number of borewells, the Paithi River in Patala would dry up forever, as there was no supply of new water in it
 vaigyanik to yahi chaahate hai ki pataal main jami nadi ke pani kaa behisaab istemaal na kiya jaae kyonki agar aisa kiya jaataa rahaa to jo saraswati koi 4,000 saal pehle sataha se gaayab hui thi, vah ab pataal se bhi gaayab ho jaaegi

 After the Central Government's initiative to amend the Juvenile Justice Act to include a 16-year-old juvenile in the category of juveniles involved in a serious crime, various political party leaders and intellectuals believe that only juveniles should be punished Instead of being considered adult, the age of majority should be reduced to 16 years
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii rashtriya upaadhyaksh lakshmikanta chawla ne is bare main kaha, ‘kendriya mantriparishad ne bal vikaas mantri ke suzav par is baat ko manjuuri de di he ki ghrunit aparaadhon main shaamil 16 saal kii aayu ke kishor ko dand dene ke liye balig mana jayega
 The Central Government has approved changes in the Juvenile Justice Act for this
 ’chawla ne kaha, ‘aisa ho jane ke baad naaballig ko dandit karne ke liye bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat karrwai kii jaaegi na ki kishor nyaay adhinium ke tahat
 i want to ask the central government, if a 16-year-old juvenile can be considered an adult to punish, then why should he not be considered an adult for all other purposes
 behatar to yah hoga ki sarkaar desh main balig hone kii umr ko kam kar 16 saal kar de
 On the other hand, Sandhya Bajaj, a former member of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said, "the most important thing is to know whether a teenager has committed a crime with a particular intention or not and if done he can commit further crime, in such a case He should be considered an adult
 ’sandhya bajaj ne bijepi upaadhyaksh se sahmati jataate hue kaha, ‘behatar yah hoga ki sarkaar 16 saal ke bacchon ko har kaam ke liye balig maan le or use baligon vaali har suvidha uplabdh karai jaani chahie, kyonki agar jurm main kishor balig ho saktaa he to phir anya kaam ke liye use do saal or kyon intjaar karnaa chahie
 Both Chawla and Sandhya said, "the government should not only punish but allow all 16-year-old juvenile to be adult and allow him the right to vote, right to a job, driving license and marriage etc
 
 ’ bijepi upaadhyaksh ne kaha, ‘bal vikaas mantralay sabhi kaaryon ke liye 16 saal kii umr ko balig maan le, keval faansee latakaane ke liye kishor ko balig nahin mana janaa chahie
 Earlier Sandhya said, 'government should be aware of the rights of children
 desh main pehle se ek kanoon he ‘care and protection act
 'if this law is followed properly and children are taken care of from the beginning, then such incidents will not happen
 'haryana janhit congress kii mahila shakha kii adhyaksh sandhya ne kaha, ‘main 16 saal kii umr ko balig maane jane ke kadam kaa swaagat karti hum, lekin yah keval ek kaam ke liye nahin hona chahie
 Even when i was a member of the Commission, i wrote a letter to the Minister of Child Development, recommending the right of voting and employment to children up to 16 years of age
 ’prasiddh upanyaaskaar dow
 Ajay Sharma says about this, 'for every task, of course, the government should reduce the age of majority from 18 years to 16 years
 ab 11veen or 12veen main padhane vaale bachche bhi scooter motorcycle par skool jate hai yaa koching aadi main jate hai, kyonki bike fishan ban chukaa he
 The police take money from them because they do not have a license
 bacchon ke mata-pita ko bhi isse pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 He said that instead of treating the 16-year-old teenager as an adult for only punishment, if he is considered as adult for every work, then the society will be successful in eradicating corruption and crime
 kendriya mantri jairam ramesh ne aaj sweekaar kiya ki congress dharna ke str par ladaai haar gai he, kyonki sheersh netritv ne logon se samvaad kaayam nahin kiya
 He admitted that after 10 years in power, the Congress is facing an anti-incumbency wave
 ramesh ne kaha ki yah chunavi muhim chunauteepurn he, lekin party teen ankon kii sammanjanak sankhya main mat hasil karegi
 Ramesh said in an interview that a proactive judiciary, highly active constitutional officers like CAG, aggressive media and irresponsible civil society have been found
 unhone kaha ki hamaari pratikriya bhi dhimi thi
 We did not reach our point effectively
 hamaare sheersh netritv ne samvaad kaayam nahin kiya
 Politics is based on dialogue, so we lost the battle at the level of perception and we did not take them seriously enough
 ramesh se poocha gaya tha ki samprag sarkaar ke pichley do varshon main aisa kya galat hua jisane bhrashtachar main lipt or anirnaayak sarkaar kii dharna paidaa kii
 Ramesh said this in response to this question
 bijepi kii muhim vyakti kendritaramesh ne jor diya ki samprag do ke pradarshan ke bare main rakshaatmak yaa kshamayachak hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin he or congress chunaavon main teen ankon kii sammanjanak sankhya main mat hasil karegi
 He said that the BJP campaign is focused on the individual
 unhone kaha ki media main vyakti kendrit muhim adhik samachar banaati he
 So whatever Modi does, whatever he says, the media goes after him
 ramesh ne kaha ki congress kii muhim vikendrikrut he or kaaphi had tak apni raah par he
 He said that there is no news of a dog biting a man
 aadmi kaa kute ko kaatna mukhya samachar ban jaataa he
 Surveys are golden dreams: They called the pre-election poll estimates as Narendra Modi's golden dreams
 ramesh ne kaha ki congress chunaav surveykshanon ko lekar bephikr he jinhone hameshaa bijepi ke pradarshan ko vaastaviktaa se adhik aanka he, bhale hi vah 2004 ke chunaav hon yaa 2009 ke
 He said that Yogendra Yadav, who does a very thorough and serious election analysis, once said that pre-poll surveys have not been correct and he has always judged the BJP more than the reality
 jeetta kachua hi haramesh ne kaha ki congress khargosh or kachhue kii kahani ke kachhue kii tarah he
 Finally the turtle wins
 unhone rahul ko marathon purush, lambii duuri kaa ek dhaavak bataate hue kaha ki unke paas party ke liye ek ranneeti he
 Asked if there is a Modi wave in the elections, Ramesh replied in the negative but he also said that there is a lot of discussion about Modi
 isamen se kai baaten bijepi ne hi paidaa kii hai
 Modi is discussed among social media and RSS activists
 unhone kaha ki charchaa hone se kya hota he
 One of the bjp's agenda is Modi
 vah bijepi ko mat do nahin kah rahi balki modi ko mat do kah rahi he
 There will be discussion because Modi is a drummer and it is clear from his way of speaking and language
 bijepi he kamzorramesh ne bijepi kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki party kii kamajori isi baat se jaahir hoti he ki vah vibhinn rajyon main gathbandhan kar rahi he
 Asked about the performance of the government, Ramesh said that there is no need to be defensive about it because UPA has eight per cent in power and UPA 7 in its tenure
 3 pratishat vikaas hua jabaki rajg ke kaarykaal main chah pratishat vikaas hua tha
 Referring to some achievements, he said that we raised 14 crore people above BPL
 jab ham satta main aae the tab bharat main mobile phone kii sankhya 3
 5 crores and now it is around 90 crores
 duniya main hamaari kol daren sabase sasti hai

 party ke kuch netaa satta ke nashe main ji rahe hai or kai ne badi maatra main sampatti ekatra kar rakhi he

 unhone dhumal or anuraag par bhrashtachar evam gaiyr-kanoonee bhoomi samjhaute main sanlipt rahane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He also stands apart from the government at the Anadale ground, which is trying to take possession of it from the army for the construction of the cricket stadium here
 sarkaar ke vipareet or sena ke sur main sur milaate hue shanta ne kaha he, "rashtriya suraksha cricket maidan se adhik mahatvapurn he
 " dhumal sarkaar main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue shanta ne dharmashala main pichley saptaah samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha, "party ke kuch netaa satta ke nashe main ji rahe hai, kai ne badi maatra main sampatti ekatra kar rakhi he
 He has no concern about others
 bhrashtachar par ankush lagane ke liye sarkaar ko koi bada kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 "he said," The party cannot return to power here in the next assembly election in the state without running a strong campaign like the neighboring state of Punjab, where four ministers accused of corruption were removed from office before the assembly elections
 " tippaniyan Reacting to Shanta's statement, bjp's Himachal Pradesh president Satpal Satti said, "shanta ji will be consulted on all important issues
 lekin yah acha hota yadi unhone apane vichaar media ke bajaay party ke manch par rakhaa hota
 " vahiin, rajya ke kuch bhaajapa netaaon ne apana naam jaahir na karne kii shart par kaha ki shanta apane kuch mahatvapurn muddon par dhumal sarkaar dwaara dhyaan nahin die jane or apane do pramukh mantriyon tathaa teen vidhayakon ko kinare kiye jane se naaraaz hai

 Some party leaders are living under the influence of power and many have amassed a large amount of wealth
 is kram main unhone mukhyamantri dhumal or unke bete loksabhaa saansad anuraag thakur ko bhi nahin bakhsha he
 He accused Dhumal and Anurag of being involved in corruption and illegal land agreements
 vah anadel maidan par bhi sarkaar se alag rukh rakhte hai, jo yahaan cricket stadium ke nirmaan ke liye ise sena se apane kabje main lene kii koshishen kar rahi he
 Contrary to the government and the tone of the army, Shanta has said, "national security is more important than the cricket ground
 " Accusing him of corruption in the Dhumal government, Shanta told reporters in Dharamshala last week, "some party leaders are living under the influence of power, many have amassed huge amounts of wealth
" unhen dusron ke bare main koi chintaa nahin he
 The government needs to take some major steps to curb corruption
 " unhone kaha, "padosi rajya punjab, jahaan vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhrashtachar ke aaropee chaar mantriyon ko pad se hataa diya gaya, kii tarah majboot abhiyaan chalaae bagaiyr rajya main agle vidhansabha chunaav main party yahaan satta main vaapasi nahin kar sakati
 "comments shanta ke bayaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue bhaajapa ke himachal pradesh adhyaksh satpal satti ne kaha, "shanta ji se sabhi mahatvapurn muddon par paraamarsh liya jayega
 But it would have been nice if they had put their views on the party's platform instead of the media
 " At the same time, some BJP leaders of the state, on the condition of anonymity, said that Shanta was upset with the Dhumal government not taking care of some of its important issues and sidelining its two chief ministers and three mlas
 dhumal sarkaar main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue shanta ne dharmashala main pichley saptaah samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha, "party ke kuch netaa satta ke nashe main ji rahe hai, kai ne badi maatra main sampatti ekatra kar rakhi he

 ek ghar main 11 shav milane kii khabar ne puure shahar ko hilaakar rakh diya
 Everyone just kept thinking how this could happen
 koi ek hi parivaar ke sabhi logon kii jaan kaise le saktaa he
 In the midst of these questions, as the initial investigation of the police proceeded, the answers to the questions arising on the death of the entire family simultaneously started being answered
 is baat ke sanket mili ki tantra-mantra kaa pher is bade parivaar kii maut kii vajah ban gaya
 However, whether it is suicide or murder under vicious tactics, it is yet to be revealed
 lekin us ghar se jo dastavej mili hai, wo behad chaunkaane vaale hai
 Delhi Police has got some written documents from the house in Burari area where 11 bodies were found
 in dastavejon se is cese main hairaan karne vaala khulaasa hua he
 In the documents, the script of the death of the entire family is written
 ghar kii chaanbin main police ko aise do register baraamad hue hai, jinamein ye hairaan karne vaali jaankaree likhi hui he
 As written in the register, 10 bodies have been found hanging inside the house in exactly the same condition, while eleven bodies have been found lying in another room
 police bhi is jaankaree se stabdh ho gai he
 After which the basis of religious things and tantric actions written in the register is also being investigated
 bataa den ki maamle kii tafteesh dilli police kii krime branch kar rahi he
 Police believe that these documents are definitely pointing to observance of mystical practices
 register main kya likhaa hedilli police sutron ke mutabik ghar se mili register main haath se likhaa gaya he
 It says, 'if you use a stool, close your eyes and tie your hands, you will get salvation
 'police sutron ke mutabik, donon register ke kareeb 35 pannon main shuruyaat ke kuch pannon main is baat kaa zikr he ki kis shaks ko kahaan-kaha khadaa hokar latakana he
 That is, it is written that which member of the family has to die by hanging in which place
 khaskar ye bhi likhaa gaya he ki daravaaje se kis shaks ko latakana he
 'the most shocking thing is that on the papers recovered from the house, the writing of death is written, in exactly the same way, the whole family got caught in the cheek of time
 police jab ghar ke andar pahunchi to register main likhit nirdeshon ke anusaar hi shav latake paae gaye hai
 According to police sources, 75-year-old Narayani Devi's body was found lying in a separate room
 jabaki bete bhavaness or lalit ke alaava donon kii patni savita or tina or inke bachche nidhi, sivam, menka va dhruv lohe kii jaali se latake mili
 Apart from these, 57-year-old Pratibha and her daughter Priyanka, who were engaged on June 17, found their bodies hanging from the window

 a small temple has been built inside the house where the family lived in Sant Nagar area of registerburadi, found next to the temple
 police ko jaanch-padtaal ke dauraan is mandir ke bagal se hi ye donon register baraamad hue hai
 Entries were started from November 2017, while the last one was written in the register on June 25 this year
 register main aisi choti-choti baton kaa bhi zikr he, jo aksar dekhne-sunne ko nahin milti hai
 For example, it has also been found written in the register that cotton is to be put in the ear and the mobile phone is to be kept separate
 police ko jaanch main bhi yahi tasviir dekhne ko mili he
 During the police investigation, cottons have been found in the ears of the bodies, while mobile phones have also been found lying apart
 in jaankariyon ke aadhaar par aisi ashanka jataai ja rahi hai ki puraa parivaar kisi tarah ke dharmik-aadhyatmik chakkar main fansaa lag rahaa he
 It is also feared that the whole family has committed suicide due to certain religious rituals in the hope of attaining salvation
 haalanki, forencik team ko mili suraag se ye jaankaree bhi saamne aa rahi he ki parivaar ke hi kisi sadsy ne shesh sadasyon kii hatya kii or uske baad khud bhi aatmahatya kar lee
 Postmortem police of 6 bodies have recovered all 11 bodies, 6 of which have been postmortem
 jabaki baaki 5 shavon kaa postmortem somvaar subah karaayaa jayega
 According to police sources, the matter of death is being revealed due to hanging prima facie in the Possmortem report
 haalanki, shavon par sangharsh ke koi nishaan nahin mili hai
 On the other hand, this information has also been received that the entire family has donated their eyes

 But how long will the mystery of 11 deaths be solved, time will tell

 After investigation, police arrested the accused
 aakhir main puri jaanch ek i-mail aaidi par aakar tik gai he

 Investigating agencies hard-wired about half a dozen cases (see graphic) against Abhishek Verma to each other
 verma vahi shaks he, jo 2006 ke nausena waar room li maamle ke daag se chamatkaari tareeke se ubarkar south block ke pramukh ‘manager’ ke taur par dobaaraa saamne aayaa tha
 But one of his ranjishjada associate (escrow fund manager) c
 edmonds alan ne 2012 main neuyork main jab nae saboot pesh kiye, to vah phir pakad main aayaa
 The investigation of the cases going against him was about to reach the final end that the investigating agencies are seen colliding with a digital block
 verma ke khilaaf sibiai ko mili zyaadaatar saboot ek buniyaad par tike hai
 That foundation is that he regularly sent a number of documents to Allen by email, which included details of bank accounts, business dealings and confidential documents
 yahi ve dastavej the, jo alan ne 2012 main saboot ke taur par saunpe the
 After this, the process of investigation started
 lekin ab sibiai ne daawa kiya he ki vah yah sabit nahin kar sakati ki inamen se ek i-mail aaidi evaherzigova@gmail
 com (which is probably named after a Czech model and through which some of the most important documents were sent to Allen) was used only and only by Verma
 adaalat main pesh report kahati he, “jaanch ke dauraan yah sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa ki evaherzigova@gmail
 com was used solely by Verma
 ”sibiai ne yah closer report us maamle main daakhil kii he, jo verma ke khilaaf chal rahe maamalon main sabase kam vivaadaaspad he
 In this, Verma is accused of producing an alleged fake letter of a CBI officer who gave him a clean chit in the 2009 Naval War Room Leak Case
 lekin ab sibiai kii closer report se sabooton kaa vah puraa pulinda kamjor hota lag rahaa he, jise is badnaam (bhale hi hoshiyaar) kaarobaari ke khilaaf silsilewar taiyaar kiya gaya he
 However, the CBI report has not yet been approved by the court
 isamen jaanch ko band karne kii vajahen ginai gai hai
 One of these reasons is that there is no certified beneficiary of the fake letter
 ek or ahm baat yah kahi gai he ki i-mail aaidi kaa verma ke saath sidhaa rishta sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 If the court approves this report, it can go against cbi's stand against Verma himself in the most sensitive cases under the Government Secrecy Act (OSA), because these cases are based on the premise that Verma has Sensitive documents were sent abroad by e-mail ID
 sibiai or pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke haathon main verma ke khilaaf jo saboot hai (vaayu sena or sena ke samvedansheel dastavejon or ek mantri tathaa ek sibiai afasar ke kathith jaali patron se lekar bank khaaton ke byoron tak), unamem se zyaadaatar digital hai
 This evidence was given by Allen two years ago after a fight with this arms dealer
 agar jaanch agenciyaan yah sabit nahin kar paati hai ki verma ne ye dastavej alan ko i-mail se bheje the, to ye maamle munh ke bal gir sakate hai
 Not only this, in today's digital age, investigating agencies are trying to play strange games with technology
 ve i-mail aaidi ke ipi adress kaa peechha karte hue verma ke farmahouse pahunchin, jahaan ekmaatr kiraayedaar ke taur par usee kaa naam darj he
 Despite this, the CBI has said in the closure report that it cannot conclusively prove that it was Verma who used this email id to send the documents
 is par alan kaa kahana he ki agency kaa yah rukh kanoonee taur par itnaa vajani he ki isse verma ke khilaaf sabhi maamle rafa-dfa ho sakate hai
 Allen told India Today, "if the court approves this closure report in the case of alleged forgery of cbi's letter to Abhishek Verma, then all other CBI and ED cases going against him in many other courts in India
 The way for being legally dismissed will be cleared
 ” alan ne is bare main pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bhi likhaa he
 Verma has been in jail for more than two years
 haalanki vah kabhi-kabhaar or rahasyamay dhang se ab bhi twit karata rahata he, lekin uskaa paksh lene ke liye sampark nahin kiya ja sakaa
 However, his legal team has welcomed the closure report and is confident that the cases will be quashed
 verma ke vakil maninder singh ne india today se kaha, “mere muvakkil ke khilaaf kisi bhi maamle main koi khara saboot nahin he
 Even in the well-known Navy War Room Leak Case, his role appears in the supplementary chargesheet
 sarkari gopneeyata kanoon ke tahat doosraa maamla bhi puri tarah hawaii hi he
 "however, the CBI says that the termination report will not affect the investigation of other cases and in most of the cases the cases are moving at a fast pace
 jaanch agency ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, “hamaare paas tagade saboot hai or is samaapan report kaa duusare maamalon kii jaanch par koi asar nahin hoga
 According to the agency, the termination report is not just based on the fact that Verma's connection to the email id could not be proved, it is also based on other aspects — the actual forgery could not be traced, nor was it
 There is evidence that Varma used the letter to cheat
 (apane achche dinon main abhishek verma)afasar nijee taur par sweekaar karte hai ki jab aparaadh ke taar kai ilaakon main faile hote hai, tab agency ko aam taur par adaalat main pesh karne laayak electronic saboot jutaney main mushkilen pesh aati hai
 a senior CBI officer says, "digital / electronic evidence has its own lifespan
 unhen vakt rahete jabt na kiya jaae, to ve apni sarthakata ganvaa dete hai
 It also becomes difficult to prove whether these evidence has been tampered with
 ”jaanchakarta yah bhi kehete hai ki verma ke khilaaf darj maamalon main zyada badi rukaawaton kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 However, he is hopeful that he will be able to seize the money raised by Verma and his associates
 khaskar idi ne kuch dhanrashi jabt kii he or verma ke dhansroton ko khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 But the reality is that even in the last two years, important matters have not progressed much
 misaal ke taur par, raksha mantralay se dastavejon ke li hone kaa maamla len
 If proven guilty, Verma could face 14 years in prison
 sibiai abhi yah tak pataa nahin laga pai he ki vaayu sena kii salanaa adhigrahan yojanaayen, sabase ahm adhigrahan pariyojnaon kii saar report or ieef pariyojnaon kii nigaraanee ke liye vaayu sena mukhyalay se taiyaar databes aakhir kisne li kiya
 Or who leaked details of the Army's weapon systems and the Navy's confidential report about the aircraft carrying the reconnaissance at sea
 beshak sibiai ko kai adchanon kaa saamana karnaa he
 It is also possible that other countries do not offer extradited letters, and it is possible that Allen may not be ready to testify in an Indian court
 isamen bhi shaq nahin ki uskaa muqabla ek behad taqatvar or oonche rasookh vaale aaropee se he
 Look at the example: Recently, an iphone and 30-page written note was handed over to the ED, which is investigating the allegations of money laundering
 jaanch afasaron ke mutabik, iphone verma ke ek karmchaaree ke ghar se chaape ke dauraan baraamad hua tha
 It is suspected that Varma also used it
 isamen kathith taur par tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale byore hai, jinase pataa chalata he ki ve kis tarah paisa vasuulakar jail main verma ko ‘sukh-suvidhaayen’ muhaiyaa karvaa rahe hai
 The recovered note reveals Varma's alleged instructions, which he gave to his close aides to bring and deliver the money
 ek note main verma ne apane aadmi ko likhaa he ki vah dubai main rahane vaali, ek purv sahyogi kii patni se chaar karod ru
 Brought it verma ke vakil in aaropon se inkaar karte hai
 However, in other cases, the ED has definitely moved forward
