 ) Nuclear buttoned statement of US President Donald Trump had shocked the whole world including North Korea
 is bayaan ke saath hi soshal media par ek nai jang chhid gai thi
 Is Donald Trump's mental state right? The answer to all these questions will now be found through the medical check-up of Trump
 agle saptaah white house main trump kaa formal health check-ap hoga
 71-year-old Donald Trump will be checked up by none other than the same doctor who checked-up former US President Barack Obama
 check-ap ke baad report kaa kuch hissaa saarvajanik bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 However, it is not necessary that they have to make their documents public
 america kanoon ke mutabik, unke paas inhen privet rakhane kaa bhi adhikaar he
 This check-up will be about two hours, there will be many tests
 koun-se test honge? # blad test # urine test # heart test # sone kii aadat kaa test # sex lifekhaan hogi jaanch?america raashtrapati kii jaanch desh ke sabase bade military aspataal main hogi
 Trump may undergo a medical examination next Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington DC
 raashtrapati banane ke baad trump kaa ye pehla normal check-ap hoga
 Let me tell you that recently, in a book by journalist Michael Wolfe, such questions have come up for discussion after some revelations
 kitaab main likhaa gaya ki trump pichley kuch dinon se apane puraane doston, puraani baton ko bhi nahin yaad rakh paa rahe hai
 The book said that Trump is repeating the same things repeatedly during his speech
 lagaataar uth rahe sawaalon ke bich trump ne khud bhi is mudde ko lekar twit kiya tha
 He wrote that a year after assuming office, a new theory has now emerged
 unhone kaha ki mere puure jivan main sirf do hi takatein rahi hai, ek to menter sthiti or doosraa smart hona
 He wrote that earlier Hillary Clinton had tried to do a similar trick but the result is in front of everyone
 
 
 
 
 Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart
 Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames

 Donald Trump's reply to Kim Jong's statement about the nuclear button being on the table
 trump ne ek kadam aage badhkar kaha he ki unke paas or bada newclear batan he
 Donald Trump had said in a tweet that the leader of North Korea should tell someone in his hunger-affected country that i too have a nuclear button
 trump ne apane twit main likhaa he, 'koi kim jong un ko bataae ki mere paas bhi newclear batan he, jo uske batan se bahut bada or taqatvar he

 ' In Chhattisgarh, despite the payment of government bonus, farmers' suicides are not stopping
 hafte bhar main paanch kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he jabaki saal bhar main 197 kisaan aatmahatyaayein kar chuke he
 The government is shocked because it claims that despite many steps being taken in the interest of farmers, farmers are embracing death
 jab sarkaar ne aatmahatyaon kii padtaal kii tab pataa padaa ki zyaadaatar aatmahatyaayein sarkari karj nahin balki sthaneey sahukaaron se karj lene ke chalate hui he
 At present, the farmers are on the streets for taking action against stealthy and non-licensed moneylenders
 kisaanon ke mutabik, unhen bahut oonchi byaaj daron par udhaar milti he
 Due to this, they have to mortgage their farm, and the moneylender creates so much pressure that there is no other step other than suicide
 chhattisgarh main kisaan sahukaaron ke karj ke boj tale itnaa dab chuke hai ki unhen samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki jindagi jie yaa phir jin kisaanon ne maut ko gale lagaaya he unheen ke naqshe kadam main chal pade
 For example, they should also take steps like suicide
 kaaran saaf he
 There is a double whammy on farmers who will repay the loan
 ek to bainkon or sahakaari sansthaaon kaa karj doosraa gaanv kasbon kii sahukaaron kaa karj
 It is a moneylender who does not have a legal license to lend or loan to anyone, nor any legal authority letter
 bas unki ganth main moti rakam he jisase wo din dooni or raat chauguni kamai karte he
 For such moneylenders, the farmer is not only a special customer but is also the main source of their earnings because they get the opportunity to do one ten
 or to or sarkari afasar ho yaa phir police yaa thana har kisi kaa inhe sangrakshan praapt he
 They come in handy when farmers are in trouble because after taking loan from one bank or institution, that loan will be repaid till no other bank gives them fresh loan
 aise halaat main phir kitni bhi oonchi byaaj dar ho, kisaanon ko gaanv-kasbon ke sahukaaron ke sharan main janaa hota he
 It is only because of them that they are able to buy manure seeds and also sow
 lekin yahi sahuukaar ab kisaanon kii maut ke kaaran ban gaye he
 Debt on loan and high interest rates on it have made their lives difficult
 rajya main gaiyr licency sahuukaar rojaanaa paanch fisadi tak byaaj le rahe he jabaki rashtriyakrut bank salanaa das se baarah fisadi tak hi karj vasuulate hai
 In Chhattisgarh, the practice of giving three types of loans illegally has been going on for years
 pehali hatki pratha, duusari pratidin kii pratha or teesri maahvaaree pratha
 In all these three practices, the condition of farmers has been diluted
 kisaan jis din rakam udhaar letaa he usee din sahukaaron kii jholii nakadi se bharne lagati he
 The compound interest rates are so high that the same slogan is heard in village towns
 jab tak suraj chaand rahegaa tab tak byaaj dene waalon kaa naam khaataa bahi main rahegaa
 In Chhattisgarh farmers are committing suicide in Chhattisgarh, despite giving them free power, concessions in compost seeds, and free agricultural advice, in addition to various types of concessions, up to five hards of power pumps
 aatmahatyaayein us daur main bhi ho rahi he jab rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh kisaano ko 21 sau karod kaa bonus dene ke liye gaanv kii khaak chaan rahe hai

 Incidents of Rape are Increasing On the one hand, where different state governments make big claims to curb crime, in the capital of the country, the incidence of rape has increased rather than decreasing

 rajan ke saath-saath bangaleru passport offis ke teen adhikariyon ko bhi saat saal kii sajaa sunai gai he
 a penalty of Rs 15,000 has also been imposed on the four convicts, including Rajan
 70 se zyada mukademon main aaropee chota rajan ke khilaaf yah pehla maamla he, jisamen adaalat ne use sajaa sunai he
 Chhota Rajan, once considered to be the closest to most wanted underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, had dared the police for more than two decades
 'ajtak' aapako bataane ja rahaa he ki farji passport cese main sajaa milane se lekar chota rajan kii videsh main giraftaar or use bharat laae jane kii puri insaide storiunderworld don chota rajan kaa asli naam rajendra sadashiv niklje he
 In the fake passport case, Chhota Rajan was alleged to have obtained a fake passport with the help of three Bangalore Passport Office officials Jayashree Dattatreya Rahate, Deepak Natwarlal Shah and Lalitha Laxmanan
 yah farji passport use mohan kumaar naam se ishyu kiya gaya tha
 All the three officers who helped Chhota Rajan have retired at present
 is cese main rajan samet in teenon adhikariyon ko bhi saat saal kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Trial was over in October 2016 Trial in passport case ended in October 2016 itself
 pehle maamle se judi ek yachika ke hai court main lambit hone kii vajah se or phir trial court ke jaj kaa tabadalaa hone ke kaaran yah maamla chah maheene tak adaalat main atka rahaa
 At the time of his arrest, the passport recovered from Chhota Rajan was the same passport, which was issued to him from the Passport Office in Bangalore
 rajan kaa daawa tha ki use yah passport bhartiya adhikariyon ne hi muhaiyaa karavaaya tha
 Rajan was living in Australia for the last 12 years by becoming Mohan Kumar through this fake passport
 kaise hua chota rajan giraftaarota rajan ko 25 oktober, 2015 ko indonesia ke bali shahar se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Actually, just a phone call to underworld don Chhota Rajan was sent behind bars
 hameshaa vioipi ke jariye kol karne vaale rajan ne 24 oktober, 2015 ko whatsap ke jariye apane ek shubhachintak ko phone kiya tha
 This call was taped by the security agencies
 phone par chota rajan ne kaha tha ki ab vah australia main surakshit nahin he or bahut jald se yahaan se nikal jayega
 After this the security agencies were alerted
 interpol ne bhi rajan ke desh chhodkar nikalne ke sambandh main alert jari kar diya
 On October 25, 2015, the Australian Federal Police received the news that a citizen of Indian origin was going to Bali
 federal police ne fouran interpol ke jariye bali imigration department ko isaki soochna di or chota rajan ko bali pahunchate hi airport par giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Chhota Rajan was very scared at the time of arrest
 usne khud par khatre kii baat bhi kabool kii
 He told that d Company i
e
 Dawood's gang is behind him
 aise bharat laayaa gaya anderworld donrajan kii giraftaar ke baad daaud ibrahim ke khaas gurgey chota shakeel ne kaha tha ki unke ishaare par hi rajan kii giraftaar hui thi
 Along with this, Shakeel also threatened to kill Rajan
 bali main chota rajan kii giraftaar kii bhartiya grih mantralay ne pushti kar di thi
 India has an extradition treaty with Indonesia, due to which it was not difficult to bring Chhota Rajan to India
 sutron ke mutabik, is oparation ke liye bharat sarkaar ke mantri general ve
 K
 singh khaastaur par indonesia gaye the or vah kagaji karrwai karke waapas laut aae the
 It was also said that in view of the threat from d Company, Chhota Rajan himself wanted to come to India
 chota rajanko bharat laane main sibiai, intelligence unit or mumbai krime branch kaa bada haath tha
 Chhota Rajan was airlifted from Pali to Delhi's Palam Airport in the morning of 6 November 2015 under tight security
 rajan ne plane se utarate hi sabase pehle bhartiya dharti ko choomaa tha
 The 'two plans' made to bring Rajan to Rajan from the airport to the CBI headquarters took a lot of precaution, it can be gauged from this that two plans were prepared to bring him
 plan 'e' or plan 'bi'
 Under plan 'A', a bulletproof car came out of the main gate of the airport with a dummy convoy and reached the Special Cell office at Lodhi Colony
 vahiin, doosraa 'asli kafila' use lekar sidhe sibiai daftar pahunchaa tha
 The Maharashtra government had handed over all the cases related to Chhota Rajan to the CBI
 rajan par aatanki gatividhiyon ke alaava hatya, hatya kaa prayaas, ugaahi or taskari jaise kareeb 70 sangeen maamle darj hai
 Rajan is also accused of killing journalist Jade
 farji passport maamle main sibiai kii castady main rahane ke baad 19 november, 2015 se vah tihaad jail main band he
 a warrant was also issued in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail to present Chhota Rajan before the MCOCA court, but on the plea of the Tihar administration, the CBI told the court that if Rajan is sent to Mumbai, his life is threatened there Can
 anderworld va sthaneey badmaash uski jail main hatya kar sakate hai
 Rajan himself also said that he would be murdered when he was taken to Mumbai
 jiske baad rajan kii video conferencing ke madhyam se tihaad jail se macoka adaalat main peshi hui thi
 If Sivan's troubles are related to Chhota Rajan, Chhota Rajan is kept in jail number one in Tihar
 is cell main sirf ek hi kaidi ko rakhaa jaataa he
 Special police officers are deployed to protect this cell
 supreme court ke adeshon ke baad haal hi main sivaan ke bahubali netaa shahabuddin ko bhi tihaad jail bheja gaya tha
 Shahabuddin is kept in the cell near Rajan's cell
 shahabuddin ne jail prashasan se shikaayat kii thi ki rajan kii cell main lage tivi par aksar gane-bajaane kii awaajon se use pareshaani hoti he
 After which Shahabuddin demanded the jail administration to install TV in his cell too
 bataaya jaataa he ki bich-bich main ibi ke adhikari rajan kii suraksha ko lekar tihaad jail kaa jayja lene ke liye aate rahete hai
 Rajan's security can be gauged from the fact that no prisoner is allowed to wander around Rajan even for a second

 BSP chief Mayawati had announced support to the Congress in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh after the results of the assembly elections last year
 isaki vajah unhone bataai thi, ''ham congress kii vichaardhaara se sahamat nahin hai par bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye samarthan de rahe hai
 "clearly, the enemy number one for Mayawati is BJP
" par 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue ve apane dushman number do yani congress se bhi khafa hai
 In fact, the Congress talked of not fielding candidates for the SP-BSP alliance in seven seats
 is par mayawati ne palatwaar kiya, ''ham spasht karnaa chaahate hai ki desh ke kisi bhi rajya main hamaara na to congress ke saath gathbandhan he, na hi kisi tarah kaa samjhauta
 This statement of the BSP chief is not unintended
 darasal, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se basapa kaa kor vot bank (dalit) chhin-bhinn ho chukaa he
 The BSP could not win a single seat in that election
 use modi lahar maan kar mayawati usase ubarne main lagi thim, par 2017 main upi vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey mayawati ke chehre par shikan laane ke liye kaaphi the
 The results had made it clear that the bsp's core vote bank had been breached
 bhaajapa, daliton main gaiyr-jatav votaron ko apane saath karne main safal rahi
 In the 2018 Chhattisgarh assembly elections, the BSP again tried its strength
 vahaan ajit jogi ke saath basapa ne gathbandhan kar congress ko paroksh rup se yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki bhaajapa se nipatane ke liye congress ko basapa kaa sahaara lenaa hoga
 But Mayawati's guess proved wrong
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''mayawati kii asli pareshaani chhattisgarh chunaav nattejey ke baad saamne ai he
 Till now she was assuming that even if her vote bank breaks down a little bit, then she will not stay for the BJP for a long time, will come back in the bsp's court
 par chhattisgarh ke nateezon ne bataa diya ki dalit apana rukh congress kii ore kar sakate hai
 The bsp's apparent abstention from the Congress is the result of this
 basapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''basapa ko congress-bhaajapa se parhez he, par chunaav haarane ke lihaaj se bhaajapa gambhir chunauti he to party haarane ke lihaaj se congress badi chunauti he
 In fact, the bjp's core vote bank is completely different from the BSP
 agadi jati or vyavsaayee varg bhaajapa ke kor voter hai, jabaki dalit or musalamaanon ke saamne bhi kai vikalp hai
 In many states, including UP, BSP supporters can vote for the Congress if it spreads among the Dalits that the BSP has a close association with the Congress
 khaskar upi main jis tarah congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi party main jaan foonkane kii koshish main lagi hai, dalit or muslim tabaka congress kaa rukh kar saktaa he
 However, Randeep Singh Surjewala, the head of the Congress media department, says, "the Congress is looking different in UP
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa lakshya bhi bhaajapa ko haraana he, so unke saath hamaara koi virodh nahin he
 We are only against the BJP and the Congress will do well in the general elections
 ''*** While the entire nation is congratulating Manushi Chhillar on winning the Miss World 2017 title, Shashi Tharoor, one of the most capable leaders of the Congress, has reacted differently to her victory
 tharur ne maanushi kii jeet ko bhi notebandi se jod diya he
 The Congress leader made a tweet in this regard on Sunday
 is twit main unhone likhaa, 'karency kaa vimudrikaran galati thi
 BJP should realize that Indian Cash rules the world, even our 'chillar' has become Miss World
 ' haalanki kuch der baad hi tharur ko apni galati kaa ahsaas ho gaya or unhone twit ko delit kar diya
 He then tweeted a tweet praising Manushi
 yani congress saansad ne maanushi chhillar ke sarnem ko karency vaali chillar se jodakar notebandi ke liye bijepi ko gherne kii koshish kii
 However, it is different that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has congratulated Manushi on winning the title
 bataa den ki maanushi chhillar ne china main yojit miss world pratiyogita main vishwa sundari 2017 kaa khitaab apane naam kar liya he
 Prior to Manushi, Priyanka Chopra named this title to India in 2000
 haryana kii maanushi chhillar medical student hai
 First runners-up Miss England Stephanie Hill and Miss Mexico Andrea Meza were named second runners-up
 is contest main miss india maanushi se poocha gaya tha ki kis profeshan ko sabase zyada selary milani chahie or kyon
 Responding to this, Manushi said that a mother should get the most respect and as far as salary is concerned, it does not mean money but respect and love

 Pakistan's questioning of the evidence in the Mumbai attacks case has once again been exposed
 is baar ye pole kholi haiaaj takane
 Till date, DNA reports of Kasab and his partner Abu Ismail have been lost
 jisane pakistan ke jhooth ko benakaab kar diya he
 Till date, the DNA report of Ajmal Aamir Kasab and his partner Abu Ismail
 jo ek duusare se bilkul bhinn he
 However, this claim of Pakistan was rejected by Mumbai Crime Branch on the same day
 pichley dinon pakistan ne ye daawa kiya tha ki mumbai hamalon ke maamle main di gai aatankwaadiyon kii diene report main kaaphi khamia hai
 Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik claimed that the DNA reports of Ajmal Amir Kasab, the terrorist who was killed in the Mumbai attacks and the only surviving terrorist arrested in the case, are identical
 lekin ajtak ke haath lagi in reports ne pakistan ke daavon kii maano hawa hi nikaal di he
 Abu Ismael's DNA report containing the first three digits of the STR locus is 12,13 / 28,30 / 11,11
 vahiin vyasatiar locas kii report main pehle teen ank 15, 14 or 25 hai
 Whereas the first three digits of STR locus in Kasab's DNA report are 13,13 / 33
 2,34
 2 / 10,11 and YSTR locus is 15,14 and 23
 in donon ke diene report main kaaphi fark he
 Although Home Minister p Chidambaram has accepted a clerical mistake, Pakistan Minister Rehman Malik should have thought before making any statement that the Interpol itself has been stamped on this report
 haalanki ye pehali baar nahi he jab pakistan ne mumbai hamale maamle main betuki bayaanbazi kii he
 And it is also true that Pakistan has had to reverse many times from its statement, but the day is not far when all these things will be proved even in the special court of Mumbai and milk of milk will become water of water

 Modi said that despite the Congress getting obstruction from the RJD, the Central Government will give constitutional status to the Backward Classes Commission if it gets majority in Rajya Sabha
 dipti siem modi ne yaad dilaayaa ki bihar main mukhyamantri karpuri thakur kii sarkaar ke dauraan sarkari naukariyon main pichhadon aarakshan diya gaya tha
 He said that when the NDA government was formed in Bihar in 2005, 20 per cent reservation was given to the backward in the local body elections, whereas the rjd-congress had elected the panchayat in 2002 without making any provision for reservation
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki desh main lagaataar 40 varshon tak shashan karne ke baavjood congress yaa phir bihar main 15 saal tak shashan karne vaali argedy ne kabhipichhadon kii chintaa nahinki
 He said that the report of the Kaka Kalelkar Committee for the upliftment of the backward came in 1953 but the Congress did not even implement it
 bihar ke dipti siem susheel modi ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke sahyog se 1977 main bani morarji desai kii sarkaar ne mandal kamishan kaa gathan kiya tha lekin 10 varshon tak congress us report ko lagu nahin kar pai thi
 But after implementing the Mandal Commission report in 1989, VP Singh government which included BJP also gave backward classes a chance to enroll not only in government jobs but also in various educational institutions
 modi ne bataaya ki rajya sarkaar kaksha 10 tak ke ati pichhadaa varg ke chaatro ko 600 rupaye se 1800 rupaye tak prati varsh wajipha de rahi he

 Of the Chief Justice
 ji
 Balakrishnan has said that the corrupt judges of lower courts should voluntarily step down
 aise main unhen ndehpurn vyavhaar ke kaaran pad chhodane vaale sarkari karmchaariyon kii tarah pension kaa laabh bhi milanaa chahie
 In a letter sent to the Chief Justices of the High Courts on Tuesday, Balakrishnan suggested that the High Courts should follow the fundamental law applicable to public services
 is kanoon ke tahat yadi kisi sarkari adhikari kii vishwasaneeyata par shaq jaahir kiya jaataa he, lekin uske khilaaf koi maamla darj nahin hota he, to aisi sthiti main adhikari samay se pehle sevanivrutt hota he, to gracuty, bhavishya nidhi or pension kaa puraa laabh miltaa he
 The law also provides that if a government official takes leave after a formal case of crime or corruption has been filed, he is not entitled to a full gratuity and a substantial portion of the monthly pension
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne patr main likhaa he, "yah kanoon sambhddha prashasan ko yah adhikaar detaa he ki vah janhit main kisi adhikari ko sevamukt kar saktaa he
 "he has written that the main motive behind this provision is to release the employees who are unsuitable, ineffective or whose service creates doubt
 jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai ki samay se purv sevamukt hona koi apmaan kii baat nahin he
 Shankh and Likha were the supreme ascetic sages
 donon sage bhai
 Written one day, arrived at Shankh's ashram
 shankh kahin gaye hue the
 Hungry inscribed, plucked fruit from the ashram trees and started eating
 itane main shankh aa gaye
 He asked in writing if he had taken anyone's permission before plucking the fruit
 shankh ne kaha, yah chori he
 You have to go to King Sudyumna to ask for punishment
 likhit darbar main pahunche or puraa prakaran bataakar dand dene kii yachana kii
 The king said, i forgive the crime
 likhit ne kaha, nahin, mujhe dand bhugatna hi hoga
 On the sage's insistence, the king had both his hands amputated, which was a punishment for the crime of theft
 haath ganvaakar likhit punah shankh ke paas pahunche
 Shankh asks him to bathe and meditate in the river and (as happens in myths), as soon as he takes a bath, the writing hands return
 likhit phir shankh ke paas aae or poocha ki jab aap apane tap se mujhe pavitra kar sakate the to phir dand kyon? shankh ne kaha ki ham tapasvi hai, log hamen adarsh maanate hai isliye hamaara chota-sa aparaadh bhi kshamya nahin he
 Because of the punishment, it is not my right, so sent you to the king
 katha iske baad shankh or likhit ke bare main kuch nahin kahati balki yah bataati he ki nyaay ke maanakon par rishi ko bhi sajaa dene vaala raja sudyumna sasharir swarg chalaa gaya
 In the Shanti Parva of Mahabharata, this story was told by Vyas to Yudhishthira, who was learning after the war that under justice, one: The higher the society, the greater the crime
 doh apradhi rishi ko bhi sajaa dene vaala raja poojya hota he
 The court verdict on Gurmeet Singh should be read carefully
 puure nirnay main vismay se bharaa kshobh goonjata he
 As if you want to say that saint and rape! How can it be tolerated? It is impossible for a society that considers religion to be a life of value and justice, that a saint can also be a master of his unique faith
 insaaf karnaa sabase kathin tab hota he jab samaaj ke vishwaas ke shikhar par baitha koi vyakti kathghare main hota he
 It would not have been easy to decide on a proud and lustful saint who wanted to beat justice with the power of millions of naïve followers and political clout
 faisle ke baad hinsa kii ashanka ko jaanate hue bhi, nyaayadhish gurmeet ko sajaa isliye de paae kyonki ve us bechaini ko sun paa rahe the jo hamen ek dharmik samaaj ke rup main sharminda kar rahi thi
 Are the courts of India being extra harsh towards lustful sadhus? Are the courts more aggressive about the crime of people sitting at the peak of popularity? If this is the case then we should be proud of ourselves
 yahi to vah baat he jisaki vajah se hasti mitati nahin hamaari
 Somewhere, someone comes forward and we are caught with the lamp of hope
 yadi balaatkaari baabaaon yaa ucch padasth aparaadhiyon ko lekar adaalatein beraham ho rahi hai to yah nyaay vyavastha main ek gunatmak badlaav he jise laane ke liye hamen sadak par mombatiyaan nahin jalaani padin
 Rather than being concerned about the activism of the courts, it would be better to know that the biggest complication of the church in the 21st century is actually sexually frustrated and rapist bishops and priests
 isi saal june main pope francis ke vittiya salaahkaar or vatican ke ek sarvocch cardinnal jorge pel ko melbern kii adaalat ne yon aparaadhon (jab ve australia ke arqbishap the) main sajaa sunai he
 Sexual and child abuse cases are constantly in the news in the Catholic Church
 carch main yon shoshan kii kareeb 2000 shikayaton par lambey samay se baitha vatican lambey arase se pashchimi press ke nishane par he
 The Church would like to learn something from the courts of India? Well, the courts of India are also making a kind of atonement
 apradhi or bhrasht rajanetaaon par unhone itani sakhti nahin kii thi
 This mistake is not being repeated in the case of criminal saints
 kya rajaneta lanpat guruon se duuri banaaenge? kya samaaj seva dikhaakar avaidh samrajya banane vaale baba-fakiron ko rokane ke liye kanoon banegaa? kya hindutv ke purodha bhartiya aadhyatmikta ko kalankit karne waalon se sahaj bharatiyon kii raksha karenge?pataa nahin!lekin adaalat main ro padane vaala gurmeet ham sab aam logon ko yah badi naseehat de rahaa tha
 The crowd of followers is not a guarantee of the holiness of the Guru

 banaras ke ganga ghat urja mantralay kii pahal par in dinon LED lite kii dudhia roshni se jagamaga rahe hai
 White colored LED lights started from Dashashwamedh Ghat have been gradually installed on all ghats
 ye sari qavaayad banaras ke ghaaton ke heritage luk ko or behatar banane ke liye kii gai he
 But the people of Benaras do not like this light
 unhen lagata he ki elidi kii ye safed roshni banaras ke ghaaton ko korporate, mal yaa bijness street sa abhas kara rahi hai, jisamen pracheenatam nagar kaashi kaa divya swaroop kho gaya he
 Banaras litterateurs, artists, photographers also do not like this light
 inkaa maananaa he ki is roshni ne banaras ke ghaaton ke saundarya kii sari kashish ko hi khatm kar diya he, kyonki pathar ke ye ghat hameshaa pili roshni main jeevant nazar aate hai
 Milky light has ended its life
 kuch log to isse ek qadam aage badhkar kehete hai ki is safed roshni ne hamaare jeevant ghaaton kii sundarataa hi khatm kar di
 Therefore, opposition to this LED light has begun
 logon ne pradhanmantri tak ko khat likhakar isaki shikaayat kii he
 Artist, designer Ankita Khatri says with a heavy heart "earlier when we used to come there was yellow light
 raat kaa drishy bahut manoram lagata tha
 Yellow spirit used to awaken a spirit of spirituality and when she fell in Ganga ji, a reflection would come, it added to her beauty
 jab se ye safed lit lagi hai, tab se ghat to vahi hai, par ek rangath bahut buji-buji si mahasoos hone lagi he
 Actually, there is no opposition to how these ghats appear in white light and yellow light
 iske antar ko bataane ke liye banaras ke in ghaaton ko apane camere main qaid karne waalon ne ise tasveeron ke jariye bhi samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 This difference can be understood through pictures of how the ghats which come alive in yellow light, the same ghats appear flat in white light
 yahi vajah he ki ye photographer iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Explaining the effect of this light, street photographer Manish Khatri explains that "white light flattens every subject
" lekin jo pilaa rang he, usamen ek esthetic cens judata he or uski abha ko or badha detaa he
 '' liton ke jaankaar is baat se bhi zyaada chintit hai ki jaade main kohre ke dinon main ye safed lite bahut ghaatak ho jaaengi
 No one will see anything on the stairs and people will be the victims of the accident

 To remove this light, these people also complained to Energy Minister Piyush Goyal and tried to explain the reason through their photos, but they themselves explained the difference of this light in their mobiles saying that "those who protest Are, he seems to oppose every good thing 'religion' and rejects it
 apni baat ko or pukhta karne ke liye mobile par dikhaate hue bataane lage, ''ye dekhie harish chandra ghat

 hamen iske baad bheed ke netaa - sarvendra mishra - tak pahunchaaya gaya, jo khud ko dilli bijepi kii goraksha ikai kaa sadsy bataate hai
 Standing with him was Satish Kumar, a member of the Haryana-based Goraksha Dal, who said that on entering Delhi on Thursday, he saw two trucks loaded with animals, which were stopped
 satish kumaar kaa daawa he ki in belon ko punjab se laakar uttar pradesh ke boojadkhaanon main le jaaya ja rahaa tha
 After this, Sarvendra Mishra said, "we are not able to believe that this is happening openly in Delhi
 
 
 " When asked if it was not like taking the law into hand, the two leaders and the crowd accompanying them shouted, "we just stopped the trucks, and called the police
" 
 
 " Though the claims of the Goraksha Dal are anything, the videos they put on youtube tell a different story
 ek video main satish kumaar or unke log hathiyaar laharaate hue ek jeep main savaar hokar jate dikhte hai
 They later appear to stop the trucks, and are then seen brutally beating the truck driver and his assistant
 video ke ant main ve sabhi log trek ko aag lagaate dikhaai de rahe hai

 One year passed, the scorching Jeth Masharad moonlight sadness was filled with the sound of the monsoon, one year passed; kadam milakar chalanaa hogabdhaayen aati hai aaenghiren pralay kii ghor ghataaen,paavon ke neeche angaare,sir par barasen yadi jwaalaayein,nij haathon main hansate-hansate,aag lagaakar jalanaa hoga
 Will have to step
 hasya-rudan main, tufaanon main,agar asankhyak balidanon main,udyanon main, viraanon main,apamaanon main, sammaanon main,unnat mastak, ubhara seenaa,pidaaon main palanaa hoga
 Will have to step
 ujiyaare main, andhkaar main,kal kahaar main, bich dhar main,ghor ghrinaa main, put pyaar main,kshanik jeet main, deergh haar main,jivan ke shat-shat aakarshak,armaanon ko dhalanaa hoga
 Will have to step
 sammukh failaa agar dhyey path,pragati chirantan kaisaa iti ab,susmith harsith kaisaa shram shlath,asafal, safal samaan manorath,sab kuch dekar kuch na maangate,pawas banakar dhalanaa hoga
 Will have to step
 kuch kaanton se sajjit jivan,prakhar pyaar se vanchit yauvan,neeravtaa se mukherit madhuban,parahit arpit apana tan-man,jivan ko shat-shat aahuti main,jalanaa hoga, galanaa hoga
 Will have to walk together

 There are two sensations - the first feeling is the face, the stains are very dark, the hats, the tilism, i do not sing with fear from the truth
 i do not sing the song again and again - the second feeling is the new song, i am singing the broken strings that grow in the chest of the broken voice Or the newly sprouted, all the yellow yellow cuckoo can see Arunim's line in the night's style, Whoever listens to the broken dreams, Who shall not listen to the sorrow of the broken dreams, i will not accept the rage on the eyelids, i will not write, i write on the skull of the period
 doodh main daraar pad gaikhun kyon safed ho gaya?bhed main abhed kho gaya
 The martyrs were divided, the songs were cut, there was a dagger in the heart
 doodh main daraar pad gai
 The smell of landmines in the fields, broken Nanak's verses have risen, is a disturbed bit
 vasant se bahaar jhad gaidoodh main daraar pad gai
 Hatred with your own shadow, hugs are beginning to be out of the way, the path of self-destruction, you are concerned about the country
 baat banaaen, bighad gai
 The milk turned sour

 Mahashivaratri is about to come and all the devotees have started preparing it with pomp
 vaise mahashivaratri ke bare main kai manyataayen hai
 Today tells you the story of the marriage of Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati
 ji haa, puraanon main aisa daawa kiya gaya he ki mahashivaratri ke parv par bhagwaan shiv or mata parvati kaa vivaah hua tha
 So let us also introduce you to this beautiful story - Mother Parvati was keen to marry Lord Shiva
 sabhi devtaa gana bhi isi mat ke the ki parvat rajakanya parvati kaa vivaah shiv se hona chahie
 The Gods sent Kandarpa to help Parvati
 lekin shiv ne unhen apni teesri aankh se bhasma kar diya
 Now Parvati had decided to marry Bholenath only
 shiv ko apana var banane ke liye mata parvati ne bahut kathor tapasya shuru kar di
 His austerity caused chaos everywhere
 bade-bade parvaton kii neenv dagamagane lagi
 Seeing this, Bhole Baba opened his eyes and requested Parvati to marry a rich prince
 shiv ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki ek tapasvi ke saath rahanaa aasaan nahin he
 But Mother Parvati was adamant, she had made it clear that she would marry only to Lord Shiva
 ab parvati kii ye jid dekh bholenath pigal gaye or unase vivaah karne ke liye raji ho gaye
 Shiva felt that Parvati is obstinate like him, so this pair will be good
 ab shaadi kii taiyaari joro par shuru ho gai
 But the problem was that Lord Shiva was an ascetic and there was no member in his family
 lekin manyata ye thi ki ek var ko apane parivaar ke saath jaakar vadhoo kaa haath maangana padataa he
 Now in such a situation, Lord Shiva decided to take the Dakinis, ghosts and witches along with him
 tapasvi hone ke chalate shiv is baat se avgat nahin the ki vivaah ke liye kis prakaar se taiyaar hua jaataa he
 So their Dakinis and witches decorated them with ashes and put a garland of bones on them
 jab ye anokhi baraat parvati ke dwaar pahunchi, sabhi devtaa hairaan rah gaye
 The women standing there also ran away in fear
 bhagwaan shiv ko is vicitra rup main parvati kii maa sweekaar nahin kar pai or unhone apni beti kaa haath dene se manaa kar diya
 Seeing the worsening of the situation, Parvati prayed to Shiva and he came prepared according to his customs
 shiv ne unki prathana sweekaar kii or sabhi devataaon ko farmaan diya ki wo unako khubasurat rup se taiyaar karen
 Hearing this, all the gods came into action and started preparing them
 bhagwaan shiv ko divine jal se nahalaaya gaya or resham ke phulon se sajaayaa gaya
 In a short time, Bholenath started to look more beautiful than Kandarp and his blondness was beating the light of the moon
 jab bhagwaan shiv is divya rup main pahunche, parvati kii maa ne unhen turant sweekaar kar liya or brahma ji kii upasthiti main vivaah samaaroh shuru ho gaya
 Mata Parvati and Bholebaba garlanded each other and this marriage took place

 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne ravivaar ko kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main vah saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ke netritv kaa anusaran karegi
 BJP president Nitin Gadkari said in Nagpur, "our party is with Anna Hazare until we enter a new era of corruption-free, transparent democracy
" " anna hajaare kaa anshan khatm hone par raahat mahasoos karte hue unke prati unhone kaha, "ham aap se vaada karte hai ki aapkaa sapana puraa karne ke liye aapke netritv main bhavishya main jarurat padane par kisi bhi samay hone vaali raily yaa juluus main aapkaa saath dene ke liye bhaajapa hameshaa taiyaar rahegi
 "gadkari said that the Congress had tried to propagate the misconception that the BJP was in favor of voting against Anna Hazare's demands in Parliament
 nagpur sthit apane awaas par unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "yahaan tak ki anna hajaare ke samarthan main patr dene ke baad bhi afvaah failaai gai ki ham prastaav paarit karne ke khilaaf hai
 When we made it clear that we were ready to pass the motion and vote in favor, the Congress had to accept it
 " udhar, nai dilli main bhaajapa pravaktaa prakaash javdekar ne bhi ise aam aadmi kii jeet bataaya or kaha ki isse sansadeey loktantr kii paripakvata kaa pataa chalata he
 He said, "what we are seeing in Ramlila Maidan today is a new realization of the attitude of the common man
 antatogatva isse teevr pragati ke ek nae yug kii shuruyaat hogi
 "it may be known that 74-year-old Anna Hazare ended his fast on the thirteenth day at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday after getting assurances from Parliament and the government on his three major demands included in the Jan Lokpal Bill
 jaavdekar ne aage kaha, "kal hamane sansad kii sabase acchhee baat dekhi or desh bahes ke str or uddeshy kii gambheertha ko dekhakar vaaki khush hua hoga
 This is the beauty of democracy
 " unhone kaha ki ramlila maidan main chalaa andolan madhya varg kaa andolan nahin tha, jaisaa ki kaha ja rahaa he, balki yah aam janata kaa andolan tha
 Many people came from villages to participate in it
 shaadi ke baad kai mahilaon kii ye shikaayat hoti he ki unke pati unhen wo sammaan nahin dete jo unhen milanaa chahie
 The relationship is a mixture of sweet and sweet moments
 pati-patni ke rishte main agar keval khatas hi rah jaae to phir us rishte kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa
 Both husband and wife should make equal efforts to save the marriage relationship
 agar ek bhi apni jimmedaari naa nibhaaen to phir rishte kii door kamjor pad jaati he
 Let's know about the habits of men due to which they are not able to become good husbands
 shaadi ke baad ladakon main achaanak aate hai ye 8 badlaav!1- aalochana karnaa-kai baar aisa dekha gaya he ki dusron ke saamne pati apni patniyon kii aalochana karte najar aate hai
 Or sometimes even if they do not get the food of their choice, they tell them different things
 aisa karnaa galat he
 You need to tell them what you did not like about them
 iske baad aapako unke achche kaamon kii prashansa karne kii bhi jarurat he
 2- stopping-after marriage, husbands keep various kinds of restraints on their wives
 unhen ye samajhane kii jarurat he ki jaise unki kuch icchhaaen hai waisi hi dusron kii bhi hai
 Excessive restriction leads to irritability in the nature of wives
 unhen mardon kii tarah dost banane, ghoomane-phirane kii puri aazaadee honi chahie, taaki wo apane jivan main swatantra mahasoos kar saken or unhen aapkaa saath kisi tarah kaa bandhan mahasoos naa ho
 3- Understanding them as just a working machine - If you go to office every day, then women also take care of household at home
 aise main unase zyada kaam karana koi badai vaali baat nahin he
 Nowadays, women work from house to house as well as household
 aise main ghar ke chote-mote kaamon kaa bhaar agar pati apane sar le len, to ye patniyon ke liye bade aaraam kii baat hogi
 If you want old love back, remember these 4 things- Forgetting to show love - Due to the busy day-long rush, many times husbands are unable to give enough time to their wives
 agar aap vyast hai to kam se kam 2 minute kaa vakt nikaal kar unhen hag karen or bataaen ki aap unase kitna pyaar karte hai or unki aapke jivan main kitni ahmiyat he
 5- Wrong tone of talking - husband and wife are two wheels of a car
 donon kaa ek-duusare ke bagaiyr rahanaa mumkin nahin ho saktaa
 Both need each other
 kai baar pati kaam ke tanaav ke kaaran apni patni par gussa jaahir kar dete hai yaa kai baar thik tareeke se baat nahin karte hai
 In such a situation, you need to be polite while talking so that they do not get emotional hurt
 wo aapse kuch pal kaa pyaar chaahati hai, agar aap roj aisa karenge to unhen sabase zyada khushi hogi
 People are irritated by these habits of couples! 6- Don't lie - if you think that you will try to have a relationship with someone else after marriage and your wife will remain unaware of it then it is your misunderstanding
 har rishte kii ek atmiyata hoti he or jhooth kii buniyaad par aap koi rishta khadaa nahin kar sakate
 So it is important that you try to be honest with your wife while playing a relationship
 7- zyada ummiden rakhana-har insaan rishte nibhaane ke dauraan ek dusron se had se zyada ummid rakhane lagata he
 Selfishness is naturally present inside every human being
 kisi se ek had tak ummid rakhana galat nahin he
 But it is also important to understand that if every person has some talent inside, then there are some flaws on the other side
 koi bhi insaan aapako har tarah se santusht nahin kar saktaa
 You need to understand that instead of having more aspirations, you should show love and respect to your life partner

 In the local body elections of Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress are contesting with this mood
 beete vidhansabha chunaav main kramshah tisare or chauthe number se santosh karne vaali bhaajapa or congress ne in chunaavon main puure damakham ke saath utarane kii taiyaari kii he
 Since the two main parties of the state, the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) and the main opposition Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), are not directly in the fray, this election seems to be mainly confined between BJP, Congress and some smaller parties
 is
 ek saal se latak rahe sthaneey nikaay chunaav kii adhisuchana jari hote hi bhaajapa or congress ke karyaalayon main majamaa jutane laga
 The two parties are the most active for the elections to be held in four phases from June 24 to July 7 in the 12 municipal corporations, 184 municipal councils and 404 Nagar Panchayats in the state
 haalanki inamen sabase zyada daanv bhaajapa kaa hi laga he

 2006 ke nikaay chunaavon main bhaajapa ne 12 nagar nigamon main se aath par apana paracham laharaaya tha
 There are expectations from the BJP, but its problem is still the same as it was during the assembly elections
 party ke varisht netaa bataate hai ki ek baar phir haare hue vidhayak apane samarthakon ko tikat dilwane kii hode main lag gaye hai
 This competition is highest in Lucknow

 This time the BJP has only one MLA from these areas, whereas earlier this number was four or more

 Laxmikant Vajpayee says that three names will be called for the councilor, president and mayor from the district and metropolitan committee
 inamen se kisi ek kaa chayan pradesh mukhyalay main hoga
 Vajpayee says, "no name will be added at the state level
 ''duusari ore congress ke saamne bhi chunautiyaan kam nahin hai
 In the assembly elections, candidates from other parties were given due consideration and it was also considered as the reason for defeat
 lekin is chunaav main congress phir isi galati ko dohraane ke mood main he
 There has been no change at the organizational level after the defeat in the assembly elections
 pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi pehle hi kendriya netritv ko istife kii peshkash kar chuki hai

 aise main party ke saamne khaskar meyar pad ke liye sabase bada sankat aise ummidavaaron kaa he, jo jitau hon or chunaav kaa kharch swayan vahan karen
 The Congress has delegated the right of selection of candidates to the District City Congress Committees
 party kis aadhaar par behatar pradarshan kii aas lagaae he? iske jawaab main reeta kahati hai, ''pradesh main sapa sarkaar kanoon vyavastha jaise masalon main naakaam sabit ho chuki he
 The Congress will benefit from this
 '' lekin haal main hui petrol kii keemat badhaane se shahari ilaakon main congress ke prati aakrosh badhaayaa he
 In the local body elections, even though there is no street for small parties, this time again parties like RLD, Apna Dal, Peace Party, Communist Party are ready to beat
 sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main sabhi partiyon ke shahari siton se jite vidhayakon kii bhi pariksha hogi
 The SP tops the number of urban legislators
 party ke 224 vidhayakon main se 45 shahari kshetron se chunakar aae hai
 The BSP may be the second largest party in the state in terms of the number of assembly members, but its urban mlas are less than the BJP
 bhaajapa ke kul 47 vidhayakon main se 27 shahari siton se chunakar aae hai to 80 vidhayakon vaali basapa ke paas keval 18 vidhayak shahari kshetron se hai
 The Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have 9 and 2 urban mlas respectively
 haalanki beete vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ne shahari siton par kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Despite this, the party does not want to let its energy be lost by contesting any election before the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin sapa ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko bataur nirdaleey ummidavaar chunaav ladane kii anumati de di he, lekin koi bhi party kaa chinh nahin istemaal kar sakegaa
 sp's state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says, "there is no need for any SP worker contesting the body elections to inform the party
" ''sapa kii tarah basapa bhi nikaay chunaavon ko paroksh rup se ladegi
 The elections in 2006 were boycotted by the BSP and Mayawati decided not to contest the civic elections this time too
 pichley 10 varshon main basapa ne shahari ilaakon main bhi apana aadhaar banaaya he
 In such a situation, BSP workers in urban areas were deeply disappointed by the decision of Mayawati
 isliye is baar loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar sanghathan ko banaae rakhane kii garaj se aakhirkaar mayawati ko apana faisla badalanaa padaa
 Even BSP workers will now contest the civic elections, but the party will not give them their election symbol, nor will they be able to use the image of Mayawati or Kanshi Ram
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa vijay bahadur pathak kehete hai ki sapa or basapa kaa shahari ilaakon main kabhi koi janaadhar nahin rahaa or nikaay chunaav main fajihat se bachane ke liye ye donon partiyaan paroksh rup se hi ise lard rahi hai

 ) bahut sambhalakar rakhte hai sukhbir badal apane sabhi pattey
 They can bring any leader of their choice to their party
 ” yah kah rahe hai punjab congress adhyaksh pratap singh bajva
 Apparently they seem painless and troubled these days
 ye vahi bajva hai, jinhen rahul gandhi ne rajnatik manch par noummidi jhel rahi party main aitihaasik duusari pari khilne ke liye march main khaas taur par chunaa tha
 The reason for Bajwa's frustration is for the Congress leaders to take the path of the Akali Dal one by one
 sukhbir ne aise netaaon ko ek suniyojit ranneeti ke tahat apane paale main le liya he
 In this way, Bajwa's grip on the party is bothering him
 30 aktubar kii dopaher ko congress ke sabase puraane or jane-maane chehre 82 varshiya avatar singh baraar ne faridakot ke dakshin-pashchim ilaake se chandigarh ke sector-27 tak kaa safar tay kiya or shiromani akali dal ke korporate andaaj main saje shandaar mukhyalay main ek alag tarah kaa photo khinchvaane ke liye aa pahunche
 As a Congressman, he served as a minister from 1992 to 1997 during Beant Singh's government and was a member of the All India Congress Committee
 40 varshon tak congressi ke rup main kaam karne ke baad is varisht netaa ne ab paala badalane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Brar, standing with a smile-filled face to be photographed next to Shiromani Akali Dal's youngest president and Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal, is another name joining the line of Congress leaders who have no qualms about leaving Congress
 farvari 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apni shandaar jeet ke turant baad sukhbir ne apane rajnatik pratidwandviyon ko kamjor karne kaa ek bhi mauka nahin ganvaaya
 52-year-old Deepinder Singh Dhillon, senior advocate of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the most trusted ally of Union Minister Praneet Kaur in the Patiala Lok Sabha constituency, was among the first Congressmen who quit the party on 5 July 2012 after being angered
 unhen shikaayat thi ki 2002 se ab tak lagaataar teen vidhansabha chunaavon main unhen tikat nahin diya gaya
 Sensing their displeasure, Bikram Majithia, brother-in-law of the Badal family and Sukhbir, called Dhillon to his house and talked to him and enticed him to join his party
 ve unke prati aabhaar jataate hue kehete hai, ''badal sahab, sukhbirji or bikramji ke rup main akali dal ke sheersh netritv ne vyaktigat taur par mujhase milakar party main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya
 "the chairman of the Patiala District Planning Board now tells Dhillon, is being prepared to take off against his past-day guide (kaur) in the 2014 general election
" congress netaaon ko lubhaane kii yah kavayad, khud sukhbir ke shabdon main, unki ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 Through this, they are trying to bring such leaders, who have their own base other than the party itself
 ve india today se kehete hai, ''akali dal ke adhyaksh ke rup main yah apni party ko majboot karne kii meri dirghakaalik yojana kaa ek ahm hissaa he
 Baljit Singh, a political analyst and Punjabi journalist who has been closely observing the functioning of the Akali Dal for years, also says, "these parties are part of a rigorous plan
 ”sukhbir kehete hai ki ve kisi pratidwandvi ko jeetne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai, ''do maheene pehle apni team ke logon se maine kaha tha ki nihalasinh vaala ke netaa ajit singh shant mujhe apane saath chahie
 Three days later he had become a member of the Akali Dal
 ” sukhbir aage jodate hai ki congress ke purv vidhayak shant ke judye se moga jile main akali dal kaa ab tak kamjor rahaa janaadhar majboot ho gaya he
 He says that every leader "brings with him his supporters along with the credibility of years earned in his area
 ” is tarah ve lagaataar netaaon ko chhinakar, pehle hi kamjor pade vipaksh ko or ashakt kiye de rahe hai
 Bajwa also believes that a stampede like this is going to break the morale of the party
 dabi jabaan main ve kehete hai, ''log party chhodkar ja rahe hai kyonki lagaataar do kaarykaal tak vipaksh main rahane kii vajah se ve congress ke bhavishya par sawaal uthaane lage hai
 But when bad times come on political parties, such things always happen
 ” congress pramukh bajva is baat par afsos jataate hai ki ye netaa ''ek lalabatti vaali gaadi or chand bandookdhaariyon ke liye” party chhod rahe hai
 Former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also believes that the Congress is weakening in Punjab due to defectors
 haalanki unhen bharosa he ki ''akali-bijepi sarkaar kii sushasan de paane main had darje kii naakaami kii vajah se agle loksabhaa chunaavon ke pehle hi congress ke kaaryakarta or uske voter waapas uske khemen main aa jaaenge
 "but at the moment the situation is looking very dismal
 party se netaaon kaa lagaataar palaayan to chintaa kii vajah he hi, khud bajva par do maamalon main rajya prashasan kii ore se kasata kanoonee shikanja bhi kam pareshaani kaa sabab nahin
 He is accused of illegally grabbing the land of Gram Panchayat around Chandigarh in 2012
 un par doosraa or bhi gambhir aarope lok nirmaan vibhaag ke mantri ke rup main unke kaarykaal ke dauraan 2002 se 2007 ke bich karodon rupye ke daamer kii kharid main hui aniyamittaaon se judaa he
 Sukhbir has also confirmed the investigation in this case
 bajva ne pehle aarope ko to saarvajanik rup se khaarij kiya lekin 'daamer ghotaale’ par abhi tak kuch nahin kaha he
 Bajwa is also falling apart due to the strong opposition emerging within his own party
 unhen pradesh party adhyaksh pad se khud ko hataa die jane kaa andeshaa bhi lagaataar sataata rahata he
 Without naming anyone, he says, "many senior leaders of the party want me to fail, so that they can get a seat by the close of the 2014 elections
" ”unka ishaara amarinder singh or congress kaary samiti ke purv sadsy jagamit singh baraar jaise netaaon kii ore he
 Sukhbir Badal, sitting in his luxurious home in Chandigarh, is already planning his next move
 ve kehete hai, ''sampark main rahanaa, bahut jald main congress ke do vidhayakon ko apane paale main laane vaala hum
 "he also predicts," By the next assembly elections in 2017, the Congress will remain just a party structure

 The Delhi CAG report has exposed various flaws and corruption related to ration distribution system and the formation of ration card after a big problem related to rationing
 is bich ajtak ne jamini hakeekat jaanane ke liye alag-alag jagahon pararashan kii dukaanon kaa jayja liya, to pataa chalaa kii aam janata se lekar rashan vikreta tak sarkaar or system se pareshaan hai
 Aajtak's investigation revealed many facts in areas like Dilli Sangam Vihar, Geeta Colony, Ambedkar Nagar and Anand Parbat
 ajtak kii ground report main ye tathy aae saamne- sabase zyada dikkat rashan main lagi mashiinon se hoti he
 Most machines do not carry a thumb impression, due to which many times people have to return empty handed even after hours in line
 - rashan dukaanon par portability ho jane se logon ko dikkatein bhi huin or raahat bhi mili
 This causes the biggest problem to the ration sellers, because many times people from other areas also come to take ration, which reduces the ration for the residents of that area and the loss is due to the people of the area
 - rashan kii dukaan chalaane waalon ke mutabik agar rashan card holders kii kaayade se jaanch kii jaae, to 16 lakh rashan card dharakon main se sirf do-teen lakh hi sahi paae jaaenge, baaki sab farji hai
 Atul, who runs a ration shop in Sangam Vihar, says that many times people come to his shop to get ration from big trains
 kuch aise log bhi hai, jinke paas do-teen manjila makaan he or unka do se dhai lakh rupee kiraaya aata he
 Due to such people becoming ration cards, the needy are not able to get ration many times
 - dukandaaron kii agar maane to sabase zyada dhaandhlee rashan card banane waalon kii taraf se hoti he, jo jaanch ke liye aata he, wo bhi paise khaakar kisi ke bhi rashan card bana detaa he
 In Delhi, even the richest person can get his ration card made by paying only 200 rupees and the poor are deprived of their rights
 - rashan kii dukaan chalaane waalon kaa yah bhi aarope he ki sarkaar se lekar sarkari karmchaaree tak sabhi bhrasht hai
 They also take commission for small work
 ghoosekhori kii vajah se rashan kii dukaan chalaane vaale bhi khub chori karte the
 But now with the introduction of POS machines, bribery and black marketing has been reduced
 CAG ne rashan vitaran pranali main kya khamiyaan pai?- aamtaur par rashan card ghar kii mahila sadasyon ke naam par banaaya jaataa he, lekin 13 maamalon main ghar kii sabase badi sadsy kii umr 18 saal se kam pai gai
 In 12 thousand 852 cases, not a single female member was found in the houses
 - rashan kaa saamaan dhone vaali 207 gadiyon main se 42 gaadiyaan aisi thim, jinka registration parivahan vibhaag ke paas tha hi nahin
 - There were eight vehicles, which carried rations over 1500 quintals, but their registration numbers were found to be bus, two wheeler or three wheeler
 - sabhi rashan card dharakon ko esemes par alert aane the, lekin 2,453 maamalon main number rashan dukandaaron ke hi nikle
 In the call center which was created due to the problems related to rationing, only 42 percent of the 16 lakh calls received between 2013 and 2017 were answered
 - sabhi adhikariyon ko field inspection karnaa tha, lekin audit main aise inspection nahin paae gaye
 - 412 ration cards were found in which the name of a family member was written many times
 - rashan sirf un pariwaron ko diya jaataa he, jo garib hai, lekin ek hajaar se zyada card main naukaron kaa naam bhi shaamil tha yani aise upabhokta bhi hai, jo naukar rakh sakate hai
 Such people do not even pay income tax nor do they have electricity connection of more than two kilowatts
 saath hi congress ke varisht netaa manishankar ayyar ne bhi saaf kiya he ki congress main rahul gandhi kii jagah koi nahin le saktaa
 He said that 'it depends on our party whom we will choose, there is no person in our party who wants to stand against Rahul, if there is any, stand up, see what happens
 ' Even though RJD president Lalu Yadav has been convicted and sentenced to three and a half years in another fodder scam case, the Congress party has made up his mind not to leave Lalu Yadav
 lalu or rajd ke saath ekajutata dikhaate hue bihar congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh kaukab kadri somvaar ko vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav se milane unke nivas sthaan par pahunche
 After an hour of meeting, Qadri said that these decisions are not going to affect the alliance of Congress and RJD
 unke anusaar faisle se congress party kaaphi aahat he
 He said that the alliance with the RJD would continue
 yah bhi padhein -chaara ghotaalaa maamle main aakhir lalu yadav doshi or jagannatha mishra bari kaise? At the same time, Rashtriya Bihar unit president Ramchandra Purave, who was present in this meeting, said that after today's meeting, it was clear that there would be no impact on the alliance
 purve ke anusaar vah chaahe sonia gandhi hon yaa rahul gandhi sab ne sampradayik shaktiyon ke khilaaf ladaai main unki bhoomika ko sweekaar kiya he
 However, the Congress central leaders also said after the decision that the alliance is from the party and not the leader
 lalu yadav ke netritv main koi chunaav to ladanaa nahin hai, kyonki vah philhal kai varshon tak iske liye ayogy honge

 According to Poorve, whether it is Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi, everyone has accepted his role in the fight against communal forces
 haalanki congress ke kendriya netaaon ne bhi faisle ke baad kaha tha ki gathbandhan party se he, naa ki netaa se
 No elections are to be contested under the leadership of Lalu Yadav, as he will be ineligible for this for many years

 Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting on Tuesday morning at his home after Rahul Gandhi's tweet with the Aam Aadmi Party

 The meeting, which lasted about 2 hours, sparked the alliance
 is dauraan party ne rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ko congress se baatcheet ke liye niyukt kiya he
 After the meeting, Sanjay Singh had a special conversation from today till date
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne twit karke gathbandhan kii manshaa jaahir kii he, lekin twitor par gathbandhan kii baaten nahin hoti hai
 AAP has authorized Sanjay Singh to talk to the Congress
 rahul ji bhi congress kii taraf se ek aise vyakti ko adhikrut karen jo “aap” ke saath baithkar sabhi 18 (dilli, haryana or chandigarh) siton par bhaajapa ko haraane kii ranneeti bana sake
 - Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) April 16, 2019 Earlier, Manish Sisodia, who was in a meeting with Arvind Kejriwal, was seen talking about appointing a leader directly to Congress President Rahul Gandhi through a tweet
 sisodiya ne twit main likhaa ki 'aap' ne congress se baat karne ke liye sanjay singh ko adhikrut kiya he
 Rahul ji should also authorize a person from the Congress who can sit with the Aam Aadmi Party and formulate a strategy to defeat the BJP in all 18 (delhi, Haryana and Chandigarh) seats' Gopal Rai is still seen attacking the Congress
 baithak khatm hone ke baad unhone twit karte hue likhaa 'haryana, dilli or chandigarh milakar 18 siten hai
 The Congress is saying that in these let the Congress win 3 seats, the Aam Aadmi Party win 4 seats and let the BJP win 11 seats
 ham bhaajapa ko ek bhi seat nahin dena chaahate
 The matter is stuck after coming here

 Why does the Congress want BJP to win 11 seats? - Gopal Rai (@aapkagopalrai) April 16, 2019 Are Aam Aadmi Party ready for positive talks for alliance in Delhi? In response to this, Sanjay Singh said that there can be absolutely positive conversation, there is no restriction in this
 rahul gandhi ne apni taraf se twit kar manshaa zaahir kii he
 Rahul Gandhi should understand that the words of the alliance are not on Twitter
 aaj arvind kejariwal ke saath baithak main kuch baaten tay hui hai
 Arvind Kejriwal clearly said that the pair of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah has become a threat to the Constitution of the country and the ganga-jamuna Tehzeeb of this country
 aise main is jodi ko rokane ke liye sab kuch karenge
 Congress has to tell who will talk on their behalf
 aage sanjay singh ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne mujhe congress se baatcheet karne ke liye aadhikarik taur par niyukt kiya he
 Now Congress has to decide who will negotiate the alliance on their behalf
 iske alaava sanjay singh se poocha gaya ki kya congress ko koi prastaav aam aadmi party ne bheja he? unhone jawaab main kaha ki kal congress kii taraf se baatcheet kaa prastaav tha, ab unako tay karnaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party is ready for talks
 Sanjay Singh further said that he will do everything possible to stop the BJP, but the BJP will stop only when its Lok Sabha seat numbers are reduced
 aam aadmi party, jejepi or congress kaa gathbandhan haryana se lekar dilli main hota he to saaf sandesh jayega ki narendra modi satta main nahi aaenge
 Therefore, we are ready to talk to the Congress
 sanjay singh se jab poocha gaya ki aam aadmi party ke haryana main seat maangane se gathbandhan kaa maamla bighad to nahin jayega? is par sanjay singh ne golmol jawaab dete hue kaha ki kaise atak jayega, kaise bighad jayega
 Rahul Gandhi does not understand this much that BJP can be stopped in Haryana too

 In Agra, the foundation of the Taj Mahal is laid on 110 pillars

 Police and security forces had considerable confidence in the anti-land mine vehicle (vehicle) deployed in the Naxalite front, but now the security forces have lost their trust in this vehicle
 haal yah he ki saikadon kii taadaad main anti land mine vehical khadey hai
 The soldiers of the security forces call it the ride of Yamraj and shy away from sitting in it
 vajah yah he ki anti land mine vehical main savaar hone ke baavjood ab tak saikadon kii taadaad main police or kendriya suraksha balon ke jawan apni jaan gavaan chuke hai
 How and when did its pole open? Anti-land mine vehicle's pole opened when in 2007, 12 police and CRPF personnel lost their lives despite riding in the anti-land mine vehicle in the jungles of Bijapur
 barudi surangon kii jad main aane par in anti land mine vehical ke parakhche ud gaye the
 After that a party of police and central security ballos were on their regular patrols
 paanch saal pehle hui is ghatana ke thik chaar maah baad bijapur ke gangalor main naksaliyon ne barudi surango se visphot kar ek baar phiranti land mine vehicalako nishaanaa banaaya
 In this incident, 16 police and CRPF personnel were martyred
 anti land mine vehical chakanachur ho gaya
 The Naxalites then laid a land mine of forty to fifty kilos
 iske baad kanker, kondagaanv, gariyaaband, konta, or maad ilaake main saal dar saal aisi kai vaaradaaten ho chuki hai
 Police and central security forces have suffered a tremendous loss of life and property
 dedh darjan se adhik anti land mine vehical tabah ho chuke hai
 After such incidents, the soldiers of the police and the central security forces are shying away from riding in the anti-land mine vehicle

 In the successive incidents of landmine attack in Chhattisgarh, the security forces have suffered the most from this vehicle and this happened when they considered it as their shield
 dhaal ab khud ke liye hi khatra sabit ho rahaa he
 What is the data of the past 6 years? In the last 6 years, about 126 soldiers who have been in the Anti Land Mine Vehicle have been martyred
 police or kendriya suraksha bal ke jawan ab iske bajaay motor cycle or paidal march hi kar rahe hai or naksaliyon kaa aamanaa-saamana kar rahe hai
 This vehicle proved unmatched earlier
 jangal keoobdkhabad ilakonmen bhi chadhane-utarane main sakasham thi lekin naksaliyon ne isaki kaat khoj lee
 This is the reason that these vehicles are now proving to be Yamrat for the security forces

 Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has raised the issue of reducing the GST rates on things of need
 unhone kaha ki jiesti daren zyada hone se desh main mahangaai badhegi
 Manish Sisodia said this before attending the 16th meeting of the GST Council to be held on Sunday under the leadership of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Delhi
 sisodiya ne kaha ki zyada dar hone se mahangaai ke saath inspector raaj ko bhi badhaava milegaa
 The GST rates will be at the GST Council meeting to be held at Vigyan Bhawan in Churchadilly
 The GST rates will be discussed on different things
 darasal, centre sarkaar 1 july se puure desh main jiesti lagu karnaa chaahati he, lekin usase pehle alag-alag rajyon main jiesti kii daron ko lekar sawaal bhi uthaae gaye hai
 Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that it will be his endeavor on behalf of Delhi that small businessmen and common man have minimum tax on everyday things
 haal hi main sisodiya ne dilli ke vyapaariyon kii baithak bulaai thi, jisamen alag-alag udyog ke vyapaariyon ne jiesti tex ko lekar apni maange unke saamne rakhi thim
 Sisodia said that if GST rates, including timber, marble tiles, electrical items as luxuries, will be taxed expensive then the common man's house will become expensive
 vahiin geet-sangeet, naatak, sarkas, kshetreey cinema, saamaajik muddon par bani filmon ko tex main chhot dena saamaajik taane bane ke liye zaruri he
 He said that under the GST, the Delhi government advocated a very low tax on things like Braille paper, children's drawing and picture books, school bags, computer monitors, printers
 1 july se GST lagu nahin kar paaenge desh ke sabhi rajya?jetali ke saath manthan ke baad sabhi rajya 1 july se GST lagu karne par taiyaar3 maheene pehle id ke saath manaaen deepawali, ye he GST kaa asar As the election days in Rajasthan are getting closer, the battle between the Chief Minister and Ashok Gehlot in the Congress is becoming increasingly intense

 Look ahead to what happens next, the game will start now
 gahalot se sawaal poocha gaya tha ki rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri koun banegaa? gahalot ne isse pehle is sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki koun banegaa karodpati ke khel main koi khel khilne jaataa he to use kahaan pataa rahata he ki karodpati koun banegaa
 This last question shows who will become a millionaire
 randeep singh surajevaala ne ise ashok gahalot kaa dhoni kaa helicopter shot bataaya tha
 Repeating the same thing in Jaipur and said that the game has not started yet
 game shuru hoga tab dekhie kya hota he
 Gehlot's discussion on this matter is very hot in the political corridor
 mana ja rahaa he ki gahalot ne ishaaron ishaaron main mukhyamantri pad ke liye apni daavedaari majbootee se jataa di
 In the Pilot and Gehlot, there is a Mahabharata eating inside about who will distribute the ticket of the candidates in the assembly
 mana ja rahaa he ki donon main koun mukhyamantri banegaa iskaa faisla antim round main hoga or ho saktaa he ki vidhayak dal kii baithak main faisla ho
 Earlier, both want to send a message to the people of the state and the Congress workers that they are in a strong position in the Congress and their supporters should not be disappointed
 gahalot behad naap-taul or soch samaj kar bolne vaale netaa hai
 The way he has said this, it is believed that he wants to send a message to his supporters that even though he has gone to Delhi, he is claiming the post of CM

 mahagathbandhan main siton ke talmail kii ghoshnaa to hui lekin bade netaaon kii gairmaujuudagi ne kai sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Due to the absence of big faces in the press conference of the Grand Alliance, it seems that even though the number has been decided, there is still a lot of confusion about who will fight from where
 halaki, mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ko is baat kaa bhi intjaar he ki aakhir endie kahaan-kahaan se koun-koun se ummidavaar utaarti he
 After that, the decision may be easy for them, but for the moment, the round of meetings between the leaders of the Grand Alliance continues even after the seats are announced
 halaki, mahagathbandhan main chote dalon ko khush karne kii puri koshish kii gai he
 Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party has got 5 seats, Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hum Party has got 3 seats with the by-election for Nawada Assembly
 mukesh sahani kii viipi party ko 3 siten mili hai to sharad yadav kii loktantric janata dal ko argedy main vilay karaane ke liye unhen madhepura kaa tikat thama diya gaya he
 In the name of Left, Male is supported by RJD on 1 seat
 vahaan se raju yadav ke naam kii ghoshnaa maale pehle hi kar chuki he
 Not happy with 9 seats, Congress RJD is contesting on 20 seats, which was decided earlier that it will not contest less than 20 seats and the same thing happened
 halaki, isamen sharad yadav bhi shaamil hai jo apni party ke liye 2 tikat maang rahen the
 But his party merged with the RJD
 duusari taraf congress jo 11 seat par ladanaa chaahati thi use 9 siten hi di gai hai
 However, a Rajya Sabha seat has also been promised
 iske baavjood congress khush nahin dikhi
 Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha did not see happiness on his face
 kyonki kirti aaazaad ke liye darbhanga seat abhi bhi fansaa hua he
 Here Mukesh Sahni is not giving up his claim yet, out of the three seats, Khagadia and Muzaffarpur seats are fixed for Mukesh Sahni's party but Darbhanga is still hanging
 rabari ke ghar hui baithkmahagathbandhan ke press conference ke lagbhag 2 ghante pehle se rabari devi ke awaas 10 circular road par sabhi mahagathbandhan ke varisht netaaon kii baithak bulaai gai thi lekin 4 baje tak faisla nahin ho paaya to ranneeti main badlaav karte hue pradesh str ke netaaon ko press conference ke liye bheja gaya
 Only RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha and state president Ramchandra Purve spoke in the conference, while Madan Mohan Jha remained silently seated
 idhar 10 circular main mahagathbandhan netaaon kii baithak der shaam tak jari rahi
 But this did not happen, all the leaders went one by one
 mana ja rahaa he ki valmikinagar, motihaari, darbhanga, madhubani or katihaar ko lekar mahagathbandhan main pech funs gaya he
 Both Congress and RLSP have claims on Valmikinagar, RLSP RJD claims Motihari
 darbhanga par mukesh sahani or kirti aaazaad kaa daawa he
 There are questions about Tariq Anwar in Katihar
 to madhubani main congress or argedy ke bich maamla fansaa hua he
 However, coalition leaders say that this issue will be resolved in a day or two
 'ummidavaaron ko ladaane kaa nayaa formula'maanjhi ko jo 3 siten mili hai usamen gaya, aurangabad or nalanda shaamil he
 There is a strong opposition in the Congress regarding Aurangabad
 nikhil kumaar kaa tikat katane se congress ke sadakat ashram main baari virodh dekhne ko mila
 From Aurangabad, we will be the party's candidate Upendra Prasad, who is the jlc's MLC
 halaki, gathbandhan main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar ye saaf kaha ja rahaa he ki isamen argedy kii hi chali he
 Congress playing on the front foot is now seen on the back foot
 gathbandhan ke lobh main congress ko chote-chote dalon se bhi paar paanaa padaa
 Now this formula is being given that any party can contest its good candidates on the ticket of another party and for this RJD will cooperate
 jaahir he siton ke is formule ne kai diggajon kii neenden uda di hai
 Attempting to practice the Koiri caste, the mainstay of the RLSP that has recently entered the alliance, is the Kushwaha or Koiri caste voters under the OBC, who have an 8 percent vote bank in Bihar
 koiri, kurmi or EBC dhanuk jati ko ek bada vot bank mana jaataa he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself comes from the Kurmi caste, greatly impacting this vote bank
 mahagathbandhan araspi ke dwaara in voton ko saadhane ke firaaq main he
 Mukesh Sahni's Vikas Insan Party (VIP), which has become a new partner in the grand alliance, has also been given 3 seats
 saahani nishad jati se aate hai jinka bihar main 8 fisadi vot bank he
 In such a situation, political parties are engaged in doing this in their court in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 devayani ko america main pichley saal vija dhaandhlee or neuyork main apni gharelu karmchaaree ko kam mehtaanaa dene ke aarope main hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 Some time ago he had talked about the incident in an interview to NDTV
 videsh mantralay ne is par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki khobragade ne is tarah ke bayaan dene ke liye pehle se anumati nahin lee thi
 On returning to India in January this year, Devyani was made director-level officer at the headquarters of the Ministry of External Affairs
 sutron ke mutabik devyni khobragade ke khilaaf prashasnic karrwai isliye bhi kii gai, kyonki mantralay is baat se khafa he ki unhone apane bacchon ke america passport hone kii baat jaahir nahin kii thi

 The Modi government is gearing up to accelerate slow-growing exports
 niti ayog or vaanijya mantralay milakar ek aisa index banane par kaam kar rahe hai jisase rajyon main niryaat ke liye hode paidaa kii ja sake
 In this export index, states will be ranked according to how ready they are for export and this will promote a healthy competition between them
 is export index main kareeb aadha darjan pramukh parameter ko shaamil kiya jayega, jaise rajyon kii nitiyaan, kaarobaari sugamawa, buniyadi dhaancha, lone kii uplabdhta, kul milakar niryaat bazaar or kisi rajya se hone vaala kul niryaat
 According to the Economic Times, the index will have six main subheads and will include 30 to 40 parameters, all based on international trade parameters, but some changes have been made to suit Indian needs
 sarkaar is tathy ko jaanati he ki bharat ko yadi apana niryaat badhanaa he or vaishvik vyapaar main hissedari badhaani he to rajyon ko bhi niryaat badhaane ke liye taiyaar karnaa hoga
 Therefore, this index is being brought so that not only can states encourage exports, they also create a kind of competition
 philhal centre sarkaar ke adhikari vibhinn rajyon kii niryaat niti kaa adhyayan kar rahe hai taaki desh kii sarvshereshth vyavastha ko apanaaya ja sake
 The Commerce Ministry is identifying issues such as stoppages of trucks, anti-competitive regulations and the role of intermediaries having an adverse effect on exports
 niryaat ko aasaan banane ke liye prakriyaaon ko aasaan banane, logistic kii vyavastha aasaan banane, buniyadi dhaanche kii quality behatar karne, time line kaa puraa karne, logistic operators ko sakasham banane aadi par jor diya jayega
 Apart from this, emphasis will also be laid on removing various types of barriers
 niryaat kaa index taiyaar karne main niti ayog aayaat-niryaat bank (exim Bank), bhartiya videsh vyapaar santhaan (IIFT) or vaanijya mantralay ke vibhinn vibhaagon se bhi mashvira kiya jayega

 Gradually Surya Puja expanded to the entire Bihar and Purvanchal region
 pracheen kaal main ise bihar or uttar pradesh main hi manaaya jaataa tha
 But today the people of this province celebrate this festival with the same reverence and devotion wherever they live in the world

 Therefore, on this date, the fast of Shashthi Devi started
