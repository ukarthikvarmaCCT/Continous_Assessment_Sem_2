 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main vibhinn muslim sanghathanon or dharmaguron kaa basapa ko samarthan kaa elaan is party ke liye faldaayi hone ke bajaay nuksaandeh sabit hua
 Many Muslim organizations and religious leaders, including Shahi Imam Maulana Ahmed Bukhari of Delhi's Jama Masjid, prominent Shia cleric and senior member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, and the National Ulema Council, considered influential in some areas of Purvanchal, voted for the BSP
 Announcing his support, he appealed to the Muslims to vote for this party
 lekin sabhi daanv fail ho gaye
 The comments pradesh ke muslim bahul jilon main rampur, saharanpur, muradabad, amroha, bareli, azamgarh, mau, shahjahanpur, shamali, mujffarnagar, meerut tathaa aligarh pramukh rup se shaamil hai
 Out of the total 77 seats in these districts, the BSP won only four seats
 rampur main kareeb 52 pratishat muslim aabaadi he magar yahaan kii paanch main se ek bhi seat par basapa nahin jeet saki
 The same situation of the party was also held in Saharanpur and Moradabad
 saharanpur kii saaton or muradabad kii sabhi nau siton par basapa kaa supada saaf ho gaya
 Even in the Khanty Muslim-majority seat like Deoband, the appeal of the Maulanas had no effect and the BSP was defeated there too
 muradabad main zyaadaatar siton par vah tisare nambar par rahi
 In Amroha too, the BSP could not win a single seat out of four and here too it was mostly third
 bareli kii nau siton main se sabhi main basapa ko karaari paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 BSP came third on all six seats in Shahjahanpur
 azamgarh kii 10 siton main se sirf sagadi, lalganj tathaa didarganj siton par hi basapa jeet saki
 Except the Sadar seat of Mau, the BSP lost all three seats
 meerut or aligarh kii bhi sabhi saat-saat siton par basapa kii buree haar hui
 Overall, in the picture which has come out, the appeal of Muslim religious leaders in favor of BSP has proved to be harmful rather than beneficial
 varsh 2007 main pradesh main purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaakar apane utkarsh par pahunchi basapa is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main mahaj 19 siton ke saath rasaatal main pahunch gai
 The predominantly Muslim districts of the state include Rampur, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Amroha, Bareilly, Azamgarh, Mau, Shahjahanpur, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Aligarh
 in jilon kii kul 77 siton main se basapa ko kul jamaa chaar siton par hi jeet hasil hui
 Rampur has about 52 percent Muslim population, but the BSP could not win any of its five seats
 party kaa yahi haal saharanpur or muradabad main bhi rahaa
 The BSP sweep in all seven seats in Saharanpur and in Moradabad
 yahaan tak kii devband jaisi khantee muslim bahul seat par bhi moulanaon kii apil kaa koi asar nahin hua or vahaan bhi basapa haar gai
 In Moradabad, it stood at number three on most seats
 amroha main bhi basapa chaar main se ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki or yahaan bhi vah zyaadaatar tisare sthaan par rahi
 In all of Bareilly's nine seats, the BSP suffered a crushing defeat
 shahjahanpur kii sabhi chah siton par basapa tisare sthaan par rahi
 Out of the 10 seats in Azamgarh, only the BSP could win on Sagadi, Lalganj and Didarganj seats
 mau kii sadar seat ko chhodkar baaki sabhi teen siton par basapa ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The BSP lost badly in all the seven seats in Meerut and Aligarh
 kul milakar, jo tasviir saamne aayi he usamen muslim dharmaguron kii basapa ke paksh main samarthan kii apil phaayde ke bajaay uske liye nuksaandeh hi sabit hui he
 In 2007, the BSP, which reached its height by forming an absolute majority government in the state, reached the abyss with just 19 seats in this year's assembly elections
 rampur main kareeb 52 pratishat muslim aabaadi he magar yahaan kii paanch main se ek bhi seat par basapa nahin jeet saki
 The same situation of the party was also held in Saharanpur and Moradabad

 Reacting to the statement of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Ministers not properly utilizing the funds received from the Center by the state, the state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that Congress President Sonia and Rahul were 'beating false drums'
 ’patna sthit jadyu ke pradesh karyaalay main samvaadadaataaon se nitish ne kaha, ‘na keval sonia or yuvaraj (rahul gandhi) balki unki party ke centre mantrigan bihar ko centre dwaara adhik raashi die jane kaa jhootha dhol peet rahe hai
 He said that he has expressed his reaction in the past on such claims, but once again wants to know from him how much additional amount was given by the Center as compared to other states in Bihar
 nitish ne centre se bihar ko koi atirikt aarthik sahaayta nahin die jane kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki yojana ayog kii anushansa ke anusaar hi anya rajyon kii tarah bihar ko kendriya karon main milane vaala hissaa or anya nirdhaarit rashiyaan di gayi
 Referring to the catastrophic floods that occurred in the Kosi region during the year 2008, he said, 'at that time the assistance amounting to one thousand crore rupees was given by the Center
 use unke bihar ke sahaayta ke taur par nahin mana jayega kyonki aisa karke centre ne pradesh par koi vishesh krupa nahin kii
 Nitish alleged that the states were getting 23 per cent less allocation during the tenure of the current UPA government at the center as compared to the previous Vajpayee government at the center
 centre kii samprag sarkaar dwaara vaajapeyi shasankaal kii tulana main bihar ko adhik raashi die jane ke daawey par pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ise auchityaheen bataate hue kaha ki karon kii vasuuli se sakal gharelu utpaada main lagaataar vruddhi se bajtiy sahaayta kii raashi main bhi vruddhi hui he
 Nitish accused the Center of not giving Bihar its rightful title and said that the Center takes a large part of the Union budget for its plans, otherwise the states would have got more share in the central amount
 mukhyamantri ne aarope lagaaya ki rashtriya vikaas parishad dwaara centre kii yojanaon main kami kiye jane kii anushansa kiye jane ke baavjood samprag sarkaar dwaara isamen kami kiye jane ke bajaay saal dar saal usamen vruddhi kii ja rahi he
 All the development work that has been done in Bihar so far has been done with the Center's amount
 On the Congress claim, Nitish said that the Congress leaders showed such generosity that they accepted that there was development in Bihar
 nitish ne daawa kiya ki pradesh kii rajg sarkaar ne jo vikaas kaa mantra diya tha use swikaarne ko na keval congress majaboor hui balki ‘mistar turneround’ (lalu prasad) ne bhi ab logon ko yah aashwaasan dena shuru kar diya he ki agar vah satta main waapas aae to pradesh ke vikaas par dhyaan denge
 On Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's statement regarding the migration of people from Bihar, he said that the state government has created large scale employment, as a result of which the migration of people from the state has come down significantly
 unhone kaha ki iskaa saboot punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal kaa vah bayaan he jisamen unhone apane pradesh ke kisaanon se khetihar mazdooron (bihar se vahaan jaakar mazdooree karne vaale) ke abhaav main ab mashin aadhaarit krishi pranali apnaane kaa suzav diya he

 ghabaraai hui ladki jab madad ke liye asapas dekhati he to use wo jagah puri tarah sunsaan najar aati he
 She also screams for help but the driver takes the cab to a place where no one was present nearby
 ladki ke shor machaane par driver usko maarane kii dhamkee detaa he or uske pet main saria ghusaane kii baat kahata he
 This threat of the driver frightens the girl badly and begs the driver not to harm herself
 iske baad driver ladki ke saath balaatkaar karata he
 After committing the rape incident, the driver also makes a missed call from the girl's phone to her phone number
 wo ladki ko dhamkee detaa he ki uskaa number uske paas aa chukaa he or usne agar is vaardaat kaa zikr kisi se kiya to wo use jaan se maar degaa

 Law should be same with all
 ye bhedbhaav kyon he? iske saath hi manoj tiwari ne monitering cameti kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal khadey kiye
 Why is there no sealing in Okhla? They questioned why ceilings are not being done in Okhla
 Manoj Tiwari asked why the houses of those who captured Yamuna in Okhla are not getting sealed? What was the Monitoring Committee doing from 2007 to 2017? Was the monitoring committee sleeping in Kumbhakarna? According to the monitoring committee, if illegal constructions have taken place in Delhi, then those constructors should also be punished
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki jo log sarkari jameen par ghar banavaakar baithe hai, un bhrasht logon ko jail bheja janaa chahie
 Officials should explain how they are sealing
 main bahut takalif main hum, kyonki jis tarah se garib logon ke ghar sil kiye ja rahe hai wo dukhad he, isliye main chup baithne vaala nahin hum

 What do they think people are stupid? BJP ruined the entire Delhi by demonetisation, GST and now sealing
 "alka lamba ne kii karrwai kii maangwahin aam aadmi party kii vidhayak vidhayak alka lamba ne kaha, ''manoj tiwari keval raajnneetik drama kar rahe hai

 Union minister Giriraj Singh and BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj are worried about India's growing population and are stating the need for strict legislation on this

 Giriraj Singh says that there should be a law in the entire country to stop the population growth

 Let us know that Giriraj Singh has been expressing his views on the issue of population before this

 giriraaj singh ne kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki kairana main jo baaten nikal kar ain or jo hamaare saansad mahoday ne bhi logon ke saamne laayaa ki log bhaag rahe hai
 Today there is not one Kairana, not one Love Jihad, there are thousands of Kairana and thousands of Mallapuram in the country
 jahaan-jahaan hindu kii jansankhya giri he, saamaajik samarasata tuuti he
 Therefore, there should be strict laws regarding population control in the country, which is applicable to both Hindus and Muslims
 sakshi maharaj kaa bhi yahi kahana he ki ham do hamaare do kanoon kaa paalan hona chahie
 Only then will you benefit
 giriraaj singh kaa kahana he ki maine pehle bhi kaha he ki vikaas kaa sankat he saamaajik samarasata par sankat he
 There should be no awareness on this
 iske liye logon main jaagarukta laaenge
 Sakshi Maharaj says that for population control, people will be vigorously awakened
 parivaar niyojan ke liye sakht kanoon kii maang karne vaale giriraaj singh haalanki is mudde par vivaadon ke ghere main aa chuke hai
 Actually, Giriraj had said in the year 2016 that Hindus should seriously consider increasing their population in the country by producing more children

 'didi' that the 34-year-old leftist 'fort' was completely destroyed in it
 riters building par laal jhande kii jagah trinmul congress kaa jhanda fahar gaya he
 Mamta, who once nursed her family by selling milk, will become the 14th and first woman Chief Minister of West Bengal after independence
 mamata kii is jeet kii dhamak pashchim bengal se lekar videshon tak main sunai di
 That is why Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from Kabul and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called and congratulated before the results came out completely
 unhen badhai dene waalon kaa silsilaa abhi thamane vaala bhi nahin he
 After all, on the strength of her struggle alone, Mamata has recorded a historic victory, ending 34 years of leftist rule
 nirvachan ayog se praapt aankadon ke mutabik rajya kii 294 siton vaali vidhansabha main trinmul congress or congress gathbandhan ne do tihaai bahumat hasil kiya he
 The Trinamool Congress alone has won 184 seats while its ally Congress has won 41 seats
 marxvaadi communist party (makapa) 41 siton par simat kar rah gai jabaki bhartiya communist party (bhakpa) ke khate main sirf do seat par jeet naseeb hui
 Forward Bloc candidates managed to win elections on 11 seats
 revolutionari socialist party (arsapi) ne saat siten jeetin
 Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya could not save his seat in this storm of Mamta
 24 dakshin pargana jile kii jadavapur vidhansabha seat par unhen trinmul congress ke ummidavaar manish gupta ne 16,684 maton se haraaya
 While Gupta got 103,972 votes, Buddhadev got 87,288 votes
 gyaat ho ki buddhadev varsh 1987 se jadavapur se jitate aa rahe the
 This is the first time since the formation of the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) in 1967 that they lost the Jadavpur seat
 buddhadev ke alaava unke mantrimandal ke kai sadasyon ko bhi karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After being convinced of the victory from the counting trends, Mamata addressed a crowd of people at her residence in Kalighat in South Kolkata, saying, "prime Minister Manmohan Singh has given a phone call to Afghanistan
 unhone kaha ki vah is safalataa se bahut khush hai
 "mamta said," People have been calling me since morning
 yah logon kii jeet he
 Sonia Gandhi has also congratulated by calling, while people from other parts of the country are also congratulating
 " mamata ne kaha ki yah maa, maati (mitti) or maanush (manushya) kii jeet he
 Mamata Banerjee came out of her residence at exactly 12 midway between the counting of votes and addressed her supporters gathered in lakhs and said, "this victory is of mother, mother and mother
" yah jeet pahaado or jangalon kii he
 This is the victory of the helpless and tribal people
 yah loktantr kii jeet he
 It is historic and after 34 years West Bengal has got new independence
 " haar ke baad buddhadev ne vam morcha ke adhyaksh bimaan bose ke saath sanyukt rup se jari ek bayaan main kaha, "yah hamaare 34 saalon ke shandaar shashan kaa ant he
 The result is contrary to expectation but now we will play the role of constructive opposition
 " bhakpa ke varisht netaa gurudas das gupta ne kaha, "yah logon kaa janadesh he or ham ise sweekaar karte hai
 "gurudas, however, denied that this mandate was a sign of a permanent end to the Left's state
 unhone kaha, "ham maidan main lagaataar bane rahenge
 "senior CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury while addressing reporters in New Delhi said that the public has chosen 'change' so the Left Front in West Bengal has suffered a defeat
 yechuri ne kaha, "logon ne badlaav ko chunaa he or iskaa sabase bada phayda trinmul congress ko mila he
 "he said that the Left Front's continuance in governance for 34 consecutive years is a 'record', which is nowhere to be seen in the democratic system
" "jahaan tak pashchim bengal kaa sawaal he makapa record tod lagaataar 34 varsh tak satta main rahi
 Such a record is nowhere to be seen in a democratic system
 " unhone kaha ki chunaav nateezon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye party paulitte beuro kii 16 may ko baithak hogi
 Yechury said, "we will consider the election results in detail and find out the factors of defeat
 " unhone kaha, "bengal main 34 saal ke dauraan vam morcha shashan se janata ko bahut kuch mila he
 CPI has been benefiting from this
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan vam morcha kaaryaktaaon or samarthakon ke khilaaf bade paimaane par hinsa hui
 We appeal to the people of Bengal to maintain peace and accept majority
 " bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki puri duniya main samyavaadee vichaardhaara kii haar ho rahi he
 The effect of this is being seen in India

 (input: IANS) Book: Making India Ausam (new Essays and Columns) Author: Chetan Bhagatpubliser: Rupapage: 177 Price: 176 Chetan Bhagat has had a long time writing columns in newspapers
 novelist kii pahchaan se aage badhkar ab vah 'export' bhi kahalaane lage hai
 His second non-fiction book was released in August 2015
 naam he 'mekking india osm'
 This book is a collection of his articles and essays on the problems of the country
 chetan ke hi shabdon main, netaa agar ingine ke driver hai to vah anounsar hai
 In this book, he has talked about the problems which according to him are preventing the country from becoming 'ausam'
 'osm' shabd ko lekar unka 'obseshan' jaahir he
 Regarding the title, Chetan has named this book for the Indian youth who are 'ausam' in their eyes
 baat shuru karne se pehle unhone tital ke teenon shabdon 'mekking, india or osm' kaa matlab bakaayade dictionari ke jariye samajhaayaa he
 The book is written keeping in mind the youth who find themselves lost in political disputes and rhetoric
 ye vahi noujvaan tabaka he jo badbhole netaaon, samarthakon, media or soshal media ke asar ke chalate apni khud kii politics ko lekar asamanjas main he
 According to the booklet for whom it is, if you read this book, then 4 percent of the people in the country are really concerned about the country
 lekin in phikrmand logon kii aawaaj bhi soshal media ke badbhole kattarpanthi dabaa dete hai
 Chetan writes that people who criticize his chosen party are dismissed as the eggplant of the plate
 phir harkar ve 4 fisadi log bhi aawaaj uthaanaa band kar dete hai or usee mook janata kaa hissaa ban jate hai jise desh se koi matlab nahin he
 Although the figure of 4 per cent has been determined by Chetan Bhagat not on the basis of any survey but on the basis of personal experiences which he found on social media
 kaise banaaen india ko 'osm'chetan kaa maananaa he ki ek osm desh banane ke liye chaar dishaao main mehnat kii jarurat he: shashan, samaaj, samanta or saadhan
 In the opening columns, he issues 17 instructions for Prime Minister Modi and appeals to him to become democratic
 vah janata or pradhanmantri ke bich aghoshit madhyasth kii tarah baat karte hai
 It should be kept in mind that they have said the whole thing in the language of complaint rather than protest
 vah sarkaar virdohi paksh main khadey nahin dikhte
 He blames the public along with the leaders for corruption
 unke mutabik bhrashtachar se ladanaa hamaari naitik jimmedaari he
 His view of economic development is that only by privatizing more and more by adopting a business-mindful attitude will the nation benefit
 sex jaise vishyon par vah samaaj ke doglepan par sawaal karte hai
 He talks of equality
 purushon se apil karte hai ki aurat ko vastu kii tarah nahin, insaan kii tarah dekhen
 Ask women to get out of their own woven cage
 par gender vishyon par unki samaj kii khami tab ubharkar aati he jab wo varking mahilaon ke paksh main ye tark rakhte hai ki wo ghar kii kul kamai main yogadan karti hai
 Women can work for themselves, not just for the family or the economy
 yah aazaadee kii baat he or shaayad chetan ise skip kar gaye hai
 In his arguments, he has forgotten the origin of 'right to work' and weaves a picture like every woman's job demands a man's sacrifice
 padhein yaa nahinkitab likhane kii takanic aisi he ki aapako lagegaa ki chetan bhagat saamne baithkar baat kar rahe hai
 You can read the book if you are a fan of Chetan Bhagat and follow his columns
 chetan ne is kitaab main ek baar phir vah kar dikhaaya he jiske liye wo jane jate hai- aasaan bhashaa, kaaman sens ke tark jinhen ve rosemara ke jivan kii misaal dekar samajhaate hai, or apni theorys jinhen wo flochart ke jariye pesh karte hai
 If you are a part of the youth who followed the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, you can still read this book
 par isaki sabase badi khami ye he ki chetan ke tark tathyon ke bajaay nijee anubhavon kii buniyaad par die gaye hai
 There is nothing new or different in their model of economic development of the country
 kahin kahin to muddon kaa unhone itnaa sarleekaran kar diya he ki gambhirtha baadhit ho gai he
 There is nothing in this book for that big voter section which is neither part of the political debate of the country, nor appears on social media and still decides the outcome of elections

 Asked about BJP vice-president Uma Bharti standing in his support, Asaram got angry and said, 'no one has come to my rescue, this is wrong, no party has come to my rescue, you have to persecute me Do not try 'asaram ke media par bhadakte hi vahaan maujuud unke samarthakon ne hangaamaa shuru kar diya or unamem se kai ne abhadra bhashaa kaa prayog bhi kiya
 In the meantime Asaram sat in his car giggling and left from there

 The dream of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan started in the capital city of Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 4 years ago seems to be failing in the capital city itself
 halaat yah hai ki rajdhani dilli kaa har gali chauraahaa ab kooday main tabdeel ho gaya he
 People are in a bad condition with filth and there is no one to listen to the people in the capital Delhi which is turning into this garbage
 shuru kiya campanghar ke baahar gandagi or kooday se pareshaan hokar ab logon ne sarkaar ko or prashasan ko neend se jagaane ke liye selfi vid garbej campan shuru kiya he
 The campaign is gaining much accolades on social networking sites Facebook and Twitter
 is campan ko chalaane vaale ardblue federation ke president bies vohara ne kaha ki kooday ke kaaran puri dilli nark main tabdeel hoti ja rahi he
 Neither the Delhi government nor the BJP sitting in power in the corporation is willing to hear this, because of this people are finding it difficult to live
 purvi dilli ke krishna nagar main rahane vaale jugal vadhava bataate hai ki 4 saal pehle jab pradhanmantri modi ne svachh bharat kaa sapana dikhaaya tha tab se unhone kooday ko koodaydaan main orkudauthane vaale karmchaariyon ko dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 But Jugal Wadhwa, who is caring about cleanliness, sees garbage everywhere in his street locality and the entire colony while getting out of the house every day
 hadtaal ko lekar policy banaae sarkaaris kooday or gandagi ke kaaran vah apane bacchon ko bhi ghar se baahar nikalne nahin dete
 He believes that the dream of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can be realized only when the government sets up a policy along with this entire campaign so that Delhi does not turn into a litter when the employees approach this method
 aapako bataa den ki dilli nagar nigam ke safai karmchaaree pichley 21 din se apni maangon ko lekar ke hadtaal par hai
 The impact of the strike is visible on the streets of Delhi
 puri dilli kooday main tabdeel ho gai he or gandagi se log pareshaan hai, lekin safai karmchaariyon kaa saaf kahana he ki jab tak unki maangen puri nahin ho jaatin tab tak dilli kaa kachra saaf nahin hoga
 In such a situation, the question arises that the government may be running a cleanliness drive to remove the mess, but the dream of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan cannot be fulfilled till any plans or policies are made to stop this kind of strikes

 ek din dharmendra ko gussa aa gaya, to rajkumaar ne kaha, "kya farq padataa he, rajendra ho yaa dharmendra, jitendra yaa bandar, jaani rajkumaar ke liye sab baraabar hai
 " bappi lahidi se bhi ek dilachasp kissa judaa he, jab rajkumaar ne bappi ko mangalsutra pahanane kii salaah di thi

 The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government of Madhya Pradesh is being besieged in the case of 8 SIMI terrorists fleeing from Bhopal Central Jail and then killing them in the encounter
 vipakshi dal police kii karrwai par sawaal uthaa rahe hai to maanavadhikaar ayog ne is maamle main notice jari kar diya he
 The state government is busy patrolling the case
 siem chouhan ne beshak is encounter ko lekar kisi bhi tarah kii jaanch karaane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 But all such questions are still alive, if answers are not received, then all doubts will remain about this incident
 1
 Bhopal jail has a capacity of 1500 prisoners but currently there are about 3500 prisoners in prison
 soobe ke purv diji ne bhopal jail kii suraksha ko bhagwaan bharose bataaya tha
 Despite this, why did the state government not take necessary steps to protect the prison? The jail administration had sought to increase the security of SIMI terrorists
 lekin pradesh sarkaar ne afasaron kii chitthee ko nazarandaaj kyon kiya?2
 All four CCTV cameras installed to monitor SIMI terrorists in Bhopal jail are poor
 jabaki puure jail parisar main 42 sisitivi camere lage hai
 It is being told that these four cameras have been closed for about one and a half months which were installed to keep an eye on 8 SIMI terrorists
 ab jail prashasan ne in sisitivi camaron kii marammat shuru karai he
 3
 encounter main maare gaye aatankiyon kii postmortem report bhi aa gai he
 According to this, there have been injury marks above the waist of the slain terrorists
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki agar encounter dur se hua tha to phir goliyaan sharir ke baaki hisson yaa kamare ke nichle hisson par kyon nahin lagi? tasveeron main saaf he ki pahari par aathon nihathe khadey the
 Then why not try to catch them alive? 4
 bataaya jaataa he ki aatanki aadhi raat ke aasapasgel se bhagethe
 On coming out of jail, these terrorists also helped because their clothes were changed and they also had weapons
 jail se bhaagane ke 8 ghante ke bheetar ye aatanki muthbhed main maare gaye
 The place where these terrorists were killed is at a distance of 10 km from Bhopal jail
 aise main yah sawaal bhi uthta he ki jab in aatankiyon kaa koi madadgaar bhi tha to bhi ye 8 ghante main 10 kilometre se zyada dur kyon nahin bhaag paae? agar unhen hathiyaar dene koi jail ke baahar aayaa tha to phir usne bhaagane ke liye gaadi kyon nahin di? jabaki paidal bhaagane main pakade jane kaa zyada khatra tha? jail todane ke baad aathon aatanki ek saath ek hi raste par kyon bhaage? jabaki isamen pakade jane kaa sabase zyada khatra tha?5
 Where did the four kattas come from after fleeing from jail? Who gave them the kattas outside the jail? Police claim that the eight undertrials were also firing bullets
 aisi surat main goliyon se bachane kii bajaae police vaale phone par video kaise shoot kar rahe the?6
 Usually 70 security personnel are deployed inside the jail
 jail minial ko taak par rakh kar or jail kii suraksha ko khatre main daal kar diwaali kii raat jail ke 30 staff bhi diwaali manaa rahe the
 That is, on Diwali night, only 40 staff were on duty in Bhopal Central Jail instead of 70
 or ye baat jail ke zyaadaatar kaidiyon ko pataa thi
 Why were the 30 jail staff discharged together? Why did the rest of the security guard not sound the alarm or city alert even after receiving news of the head constable's murder? 7
 encounter ke dauraan teen pulisavaalon ko chaaku se jakhm kaise aae, jabaki vahaan goliyaan chal rahi thim? encounter ke dauraan ghayal hue un teenon police waalon ko chupa kar kyon rakhaa ja rahaa he? unhen saamne kyon nahin laayaa gaya? police kaa kahana he ki aropiyon ne dhardaar hathiyaar se hamalaa kiya tha
 But the photos show that the weapon is perfectly clean and shining
 usapar khun kaa koi dhabba nahin he

 In the 2013 General Election, Maryam played the responsibility of election campaign for the seat of father Nawaz
 navaj sharif ko mariyam se raajnneeti main kaaphi madad milti rahi he
 In the ups and downs of political life, Mary was often seen standing with him
 panama maamle main jab navaj sharif ko ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya, to unki seat par hue up chunaav main unki maa kulsum navaj ko maidan main utaara gaya
 During this time he campaigned fiercely for his mother and as a result his mother won this by-election

 jahaan kolaba main ek shaks ne apane dost kii 3 saal kii maasoom bacchee ko saatvin manzil se neeche phenk diya

 Counsel for the accused in the court argued that the girl had fallen due to her mistake, not Anil Chugani's fault
 police ne aaropee par dhara 302 ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 Police has also not received any information about the reason for the murder, so orders have been given to keep the accused in police custody
 jaankaree ke mutabik aaropee or bacchee ke pita ko kai saalon se jaanata tha
 Both lived in the same building and were part of the same society, so both had good relations
 aaropee kuch saalon ke liye morokko main hi rah chukaa he
 The most surprising thing is that the accused has given the information of the police by phone and confessed to the murder
 lekin police ke haath ab tak is hatya ke peeche kii vajah nahin lagi he
 Discussion of this incident is in the entire area
 log anumaan laga nahin paa rahe hai ki aisi kya paristhiti ki aaropee jis parivaar ko kai saalon se jaananaa tha usne maasoom ko itani berahami se maar diya
 The police and people living nearby are surprised that the accused himself has given information about this by calling the police after the incident

 From next time, if people make such ridiculous allegations, then i will take legal action

 After reaching home, when i went to my room and saw Twitter, i found out that i was shocked
 maine apane parents se poocha ye kya he, kya aapako pataa tha

 We should not forget that Shahrukh's father is a freedom fighter of this country
 ' At the same time, another artist Raza Murad made it clear about the intolerance that Shahrukh would not have been such a big star if there was intolerance, but the kind of statement made against him should be put on those who make such a statement

 Now the Delhi Police has also issued an order that the tainted police personnel be shown the way out

 This order has been sent by the Vigilance Department to the DCP of all units and districts of Delhi Police

 Identify such policemen

 desh kii sabase smart police maani jane vaali dilli police main 85 hazaar se zyada afasar or jawan hai
 Many policemen are tainted among them
 ab is aadesh se ek taraf mahakme main hadakamp he to duusari taraf kai log yah maanate hai ki is kadam se police kii chhavi saaf hogi
 Goa's newly appointed Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar has made objectionable statements on the disabled
 unhone kaha ki aise log 'bhagwaan kii laaparvaahee se bane' hote hai or ve 'bhagwaan kii galati' hote hai
 Sadhvi had also given objectionable statements
 Her words were, 'there are some siblings in society who are born with disabilities
 bhagwaan unhen kuch chijen dena bhul jaataa he
 It is the negligence of God for which a child has to suffer all ages
 ' aise logon ke liye kaam karne vaali sansthaaon ke bare main parsekar ne kaha ki ve bhagwaan kii galati ko thik kar rahi hai
 Significantly, after Manohar Parrikar was made the defense minister at the Center, the BJP made Parsekar the Chief Minister of Goa
 vah viklaangata vishay par yojit ek film festival ke udghaatan main bol rahe the
 The organizer of the festival, the head of the NGO, Avalino d'souza, objected to the Chief Minister's statement
 unhone kaha, 'DRAG is bayaan kaa kadai se virodh karata he or spasht karnaa chahta he ki agar bhagwaan ne koi ashakt vyakti banaaya he to apni takat dikhaane ke liye banaaya he
 Disabilities have more strength and will
 ' Votes will be cast on Tuesday for the third phase in Jharkhand
 is baar ke chunaav main mukhya muqabla bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) ke bich he
 Other parties - Congress, Babulal Marandi's Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are fighting for their survival
 in teenon partiyon ke liye to pichley chunaavon main hasil hui siten bachaana bhi tedi kheer he
 Congress has no face, nor campaigner, nor resources in the state - in a way, this national party has surrendered before the elections in the state
 ab baat karte hai - bijepi or sorain pita-putr kii party jharkhand mukti morcha kii
 Right from the first round of elections, both the parties have left no stone unturned in campaigning in Ranchi city
 jeemem ne vigyaapan or hordings lagaae - 'hamane banaaya, ham hi sanvaarenge
 
 
 ', In response to which the BJP has now said,' Atal ji made, Modi ji will decorate
 
 
 ' People engaged in propagating JMM appeared certainly happy that even a national party like BJP had to find a cut of their words
 darasal, bijepi bhi maan rahi he ki chunki hemanth sorain sarkaar main rahe hai, isliye jeemem ke paas bhi sansadhano kii koi kami nahin he, isiilie ve ek se badhkar ek naaron or vigyapanon ke saath bijepi par hamalaa bol rahe hai, or aise main bijepi ke paas unki kaat dhundne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 But one thing is clear in this battle of advertisements that the BJP which should have challenged the Congress is facing a regional party
 ab chunaav main jeet-haar kisi kii bhi ho, lekin bijepi ko bhi maaloom he ki unke virdohi ab unheen ke chunaav ladane ke tareekon se sikhkar unheen par hamale kar rahe hai
 The BJP government at the Center passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha ignoring the Janata Dal United (JDU) national president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 iske baad ab rajyasabha main party ne iskaa virodh or iske kilaaf vot karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 The announcement was made by the party's national general secretary KC Tyagi on Sunday after a meeting of party officials in Patna
 tyaagi party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ke saath guwahati kaa daura karenge jahaan assam gana parishad, AASU ke saath vichaar vimarsh kar unke andolan ko samarthan karne ke alaava bhavishya kii ranniti taiyaar karenge
 However, on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Bill, KC Tyagi accused the Congress Party of backing the BJP from behind the scenes, otherwise it would not boycott the issue in Lok Sabha
 tyaagi ne congress party ko is mudde par apana stand saafe karne ke liye kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenzar party ke rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii baithak hogi jisamen loksabhaa chunaav se sambandhit saare faisale liye jaaenge
 Regarding the 70 seats in which the party will contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, KC Tyagi said that in Sunday's meeting it was decided that the three senior leaders of the party including state party president Vasishtha Narayan Singh, minister Lalan Singh and Vijendra Yadav were among the candidates
 Will take decision regarding selection of ravivaar ko hi baithak main naagarikta sanshodhan ke sambandh main jo faisalaa liya gaya usase saafe he ki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ke baar-baar hastkshep karne ke baad bhi BJP ne unki ek nahin suni or apane agenda par qaayam rahe jiske baad party ne tay kiya ki ab rajyasabha main is bill ke aane ke pehle party kaa stand saafe kar liya jayega

 van evam paryaavaran rajyamantri jayanti natarajan kaa istipha apane peeche kai sawaal chhod gaya he
 At first it was linked to an organizational reshuffle, but did the Congress really need a jubilee to strengthen the organization or were they punished for not clearing the projects
 jayanti natarajan kaa kahana he ki vah party main kaam karnaa chaahati hai isliye istifa diya he
 Jayanthi Natarajan was the Minister of State for Forest and Environment for the last two and a half years
 prabhaar swatantra tha
 Nevertheless, there were huge complaints of projects being stuck in his ministry
 iske baavjood pradhanmantri manmohan singh natarajan ko hataa nahin paa rahe the
 The reason was that Natarajan was close to the Gandhi family
 lekin, jab udyogpatiyon kii sidhi shikaayat rahul ke kaan main pahunchi to faisle main der nahin lagi
 Within hours of Natarajan's resignation, Rahul's speech at FICCI cleared the matter completely
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne fikki main bhaashan ke dauraan kaha tha ki kai logon ne paryaavaran manzuri na mil paane kii vajah se project let hone par niraashaa jataai he
 There should be no environmental and social harm, but the decisions must be transparent and timely
 chaahe steel ho bijli ho yaa phir khanan mantralay projects ko manzuri main deree kii shikaayat har taraf se aa rahi thi
 The National Highway Authority had to go to court against the Ministry of Environment due to delays in the 2200 crore project
 maamla piemo kii dabil ke baad hi sulajhaa
 Jayanthi Natarajan clarifies that the delay in approval is due to the state governments
 istife par safai bhi aa rahi he
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that people are shifted according to work

 a petition has been filed in the Bombay High Court on Tuesday against bjp's prime ministerial candidate Lal Krishna Advani
 yachika main bhaajapa kii ek prachaar sidi main rashtriya dhvaj ke 'apmanjanak chithran' kaa aarope lagaate hue adwani ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii gai he
 This petition has been filed by Anand Upadhyay, Member, Law Cell of Youth Congress
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki bhartiya janata yuva morcha dwaara nagpur main is maah jari sidi main adwani ko duusare sardaar patel ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he
 The CD depicts Advani waving the tricolor from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 yachikakarta ke anusaar sidi main dikhaae gaye tirange main ashok chakra nahin he
 Upadhyay said that this is an insult to the national flag
 hamane is par police or chunaav ayog se sampark kiya lekin koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 When asked why Advani was personally targeted in the petition, he said that he is the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP
 yachika par agle saptaah sunwaayee ho sakati he
 The deadlock between senior BJP leader LK Advani and Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was deepened on Wednesday night when the party leadership declared him a candidate from Gandhinagar against Advani's desire to contest Lok Sabha elections from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh
 modi swayan uttar pradesh kii varanasi seat ke alaava gujarat kii vadodara seat se bhi chunaav ladenge
 The decision was taken in the day-long meeting of the BJP Central Election Committee after extensive deliberations on Advani's case, and from this meeting, 86-year-old Advani declined to say that he was running views on the matter related to his constituency
 Did not want to be part of the discussion
 sutron ke mutabik adwani ne party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko sandesh bhijwa diya tha ki vah aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav gandhinagar kii bajaay bhopal se ladanaa chaahate hai
 However, he has represented Gandhinagar seat five times in the Lok Sabha
 adwani is baat par ade hue the ki unhen kai anya netaaon kii tarah apni pasand ke nirvachan kshetra kaa chunaav karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie kyonki kai anya netaaon ko bhi unki pasandida siten di gai hai
 Advani, who is busy celebrating, expressed his unhappiness about not fulfilling his wish
 party kii varisht netaa sushamaa swaraj or nitin gadakari ne buudhvaar ko adwani se unke awaas par mulaakaat kii
 The meeting lasted for about 45 minutes and during this, an attempt was made to convince Advani
 adwani se mulaakaat ke baad sushamaa or gadakari ne bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh se mili tathaa unhen party ke varisht netaa kii aprasanna se avgat karaayaa

 The BJP unanimously elected me as the leader of the parliamentary party and all parties in the NDA supported it and i am grateful for it
 unhone pehali baar chunakar sansad pahuche sadasyon kaa swaagat kiya
 Modi said that a strong mandate increases responsibility
 nae umang, nae utsaah se aage badhate janaa he
 PM Modi said that this incident of Central Hall is an unusual incident today
 ham aaj nae bharat ke hamaare sankalp ko ek nai urja ke saath aage badhaane ke liye ek nai yatra ko yahaan se aage badhaane vaale hai
 All of you have led this change in the politics of the country
 aap sabhi abhinandan ke abhaari hai
 But the members who have come for the first time are grateful to the special reception
 unhone kaha ki bharat main to chunaav apane aap main utsav tha, matdaan bhi anek rangon se bharaa tha
 But Vijayotsav was more spectacular than that
 desh ke saath vishvabhar ke bharat premiyon ne is vijayotsav main hissaa liya he
 It is a matter of pride for us
 ye chunaav kitna bada or vyapak hota he isaki vyavasthaaen kitni hoti hai, ye vishwa ke liye bahut bada ajooba he
 Modi said that this work is a period of hard work by the Election Commission, the State Election Commission, government employees, security forces
 bharat ke loktantr ko hamen samajhnaa hoga
 Voter of India, Neer, Ksheer, Vivek of citizen of India cannot be measured by any criteria
 ham kah sakate hai satta kaa rutaba bharat ke matadaata ko kabhi prabhavit nahin karata he

 The central government will introduce panic button in all mobiles from March, under which long pressing the number 9 button in the mobile will send alert messages to the nearest police and relatives, which will contain the location details of the user
 haal hi main cabinetmantri menka gandhi ne sansad main is plan ke bare main jaankaree di
 For this project, the Women and Child Development Ministry and the Telecom Department have recently held a meeting with mobile and telecom companies
 is program par kaam kar rahe ek adhikari ne ek angreji akhbaar ko bataaya ki companiyaan iske liye raji hai or mobile phone main yah feechar march se milanaa shuru ho jayega
 This service will be started in the Panic Button March that will start from March, under which you can send the details of your location to 9 people after pressing the mobile number 9 button continuously for some time
 yahi nahin, yah tay karnaa bhi yujar ke haath main hoga ki use kin 9 logon ko immergency ke dauraan alert massej or lokation detail bhejni he taaki ve uski madad ko aa saken
 One of these messages will go to the nearest police station
 ap besd painic batan rahe hai feliske alaava smartphone main ap besd painic batan bhi hoga
 However, such apps introduced for smartphones are still failing
 isaki mukhya vajah yahi he ki sabhi ke paas smartphone nahin hota or agar hota bhi he to internet kii sthiti aisi he ki google map se nevigation shuru karne main 5 minute se bhi zyada lagate hai
 Whether you use 3G or 4G, in many places the internet runs like little and then everywhere these apps claiming security do not work
 bina internet or jeepies vaala dedicated painic batan kargar sabit hogis program ke tahatfeechar phone main dedicated painic batan hone kii bhi baat chal rahi he
 Actually, GPS does not work in feature phones without internet
 jaahir he, aise mobile se khatre kii sthiti main apni lokation bhej paanaa mushkil he
 Yes, if mobile and telecom companies work together on a special panic button, then it can be very useful for people in emergency
 basharte iske liye internet or smartphone kii jarurat naa ho
 The purpose of this security button is to bring women safety in the country

 Do you also feel that while you are thinking about taking this relationship a step further, your partner is completely calm about this matter? Do you feel that your partner is more than you Too careless about a relationship? If yes, it is a matter of concern for you
 par ye baat sau fisadi sahi ho aisa bhi nahin kyonki aksar ladke aise maamalon main samay lete hai
 Maybe while you want to take this relationship forward, your partner does not see this relationship from that perspective
 agar aapako bhi apane partner kii manshaa par shaq he yaa phir aapako uskaa vyavhaar samaj nahin aa rahaa he to aap in chaar lakshanon se uske man main chal rahi baat kaa andaja laga sakate hai
 1
 aap donon ke alaava kisi tisare ko is baat kaa pataa na hona ki aap donon ek-duusare ko date kar rahe habgar aap donon ke bich kaa sambandh vaaki gambhir he to aapke partner ne nishchit rup se aapako apane parivaar waalon or doston se milwaaya hoga
 But if he has not done so yet, then there must be something wrong
 agar vah aapako ab bhi dost bataakar hi logon se milwataa he to aise main aapke liye jaruri he ki aap sachet ho jaaen
 2
 kya aapkaa partner bhi rahete-rahete kahin kho jaataa he or phir khud hi laut aata haijab bhi aap kahin ghoomane jane kii yojana banaate hai to kya aapkaa partner bhi aapako usamen shaamil na ho paane ke kaaran ginane lag jaataa he? kya aapke kai massej karne ke baad bhi wo aapako jawaab nahin detaa he? yaphir aapke phone kol kaa wo ek yaa do din baad hi jawaab detaa he? agar haa, to ye sthiti kisi bhi rup main sahi nahin he
 Does it also happen to you that your partner suddenly becomes very emotional towards you and someday suddenly disappears without telling you? If something similar is going on in your relationship, then it is time for you to be careful
 3
 Does your partner hesitate to meet you in a public place or does your partner immediately agree to meet you at home but when you call him at a hotel or public place, he gets annoyed? If yes, So do not be late to understand that he does not look at this relationship seriously
 4
 When talking about future plans, when two people are sincerely in a relationship and think about taking it forward, they have many things and ideas about future plans
 par agar aapkaa partner bhavishya kii yojanaon ko lekar aapse baat karne main bhi ruchi nahin rakhata he to yah samaj lijie ki usase alag ho jane main hi aapaki bhalaai he
