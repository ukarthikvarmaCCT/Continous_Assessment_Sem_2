 com Interview is a powerful discipline through which the creator expresses himself directly
 saakshatkaaron ke dwaara ham na sirf kisi rachanaakaar ke desh, samaaj or raajnneeti sambandhi vichaaron se avgat hote hai balki uske sahitya sambandhi chintan kii mukammal tasviir bhi saamne aa jaati he
 In a way, the author also advocates his creation in front of readers and critics through interviews
 is prakriya main vah apni rachanaaon par lagaae gaye aaropon kaa jawaab to detaa hi he, saath hi apni rachana se sambandhit kai naveen vyakhyaayein bhi karata he jo praaia: alakshith rahati hai
 In this context, the interview is the most reliable and authentic mode to understand both the composition and the creator
 'mere saakshaatkaar’ siries ke tahat prakashit mridula garg or mamata kaaliya ke saakshatkaaron kii ye pustaken bhi unke lekhan or vyaktiv ko samajhane kii drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 Mridula Garg and Mamta Kalia are the creators of the same generation
 unki shahari madhyavargeey prishthbhumi bhi ek he
 Hindi is not the subject of study and teaching of both
 mridula garg kaa sambandh arthshaastra se rahaa vahiin mamata kaaliya kaa angreji sahitya se
 But, both chose Hindi for their creative expression and have enriched the Hindi literary world with their many powerful creations
 sabase acchhee baat yah he ki donon ke liye rachana-karm koi shauk kaa vishay nahin he balki unke liye yah astitv kii anivaaryta se judaa hua he
 Both have almost admitted that if they had not been writers, they would have been violent or suicidal
 rachanakarm or swayan ke astitv ke bich kaa yah anyonyashrith sambandh hindi sahitya main kramash: ksheen hota gaya or aaj lagbhag samaapt ho gaya he
 For this reason, today there are a lot of creators but excellent works are absent
 apni vibhinn rachanaaon main se mamata kaaliya 'beghar’ se or mridula garg 'chitcobra’ se sarvaadhik santusht hai
 It is worth noting that despite being an influential female creator, both are strongly opposed to the gender-male divide in the field of literature-creation
 is virodh kaa taarkik kaaran dete hue mridula garg kahati hai, ''isse bahut sari mahilaon ko anaavashyak prachaar or badhaava mil jaataa he
 Those who are not truly writers and get approval to stay in the field of writing
 doosraa, stri ko alag karke dekhne ke pakshpaat se un striyon ke lekhan-kaary kaa moolyankan nahin hota yaa hota he to bahut anyaaypurna hota he, jo vastav main lekhak hai or kisi tarah kii chhot nahin chaahatin
 Mamta Kalia also has similar views
 darasal yah stri rachanakaaron kii vah peedi he jise kisi vimarsh yaa aarakshan kii jagah apane rachana-karm par adhik bharosa he
 Their creations are no less than that of male creators from anywhere
 vimarsh kii baisakhi kii jarurat to unhen hi hoti he jinaki rachanaaen kamatar hoti hai
 Mamta Kalia advocates a female identity suited to indigenous references
 ve pashchimi aadhuniktaa or nariwad se baþt santusht nahin hai
 In the name of so-called bold writings in literature, she does not accept the portrayal of 'female sexuality' by writers
 amrutha preetam, krishna sobati or swayan mridula garg ke lekhan ke sandarbh main 1984 ke ek saakshaatkaar main ve kahati hai, ''inke chithran main nari pyaasi maadaa kii tarah purushon kii talash main gumti rahati he
 These writers have often not touched the questions about the essential existence of women
 is tarah ke lekhan ke liye main krishna sobati ko apradhi maanati hum
 On the contrary, i find myself much closer to Usha Priyavanda, Mrinal Pandey, Mannu Bhandari, Mehrunnisa Parvez
 ” spasht he, 'stri vimarsh’ se parhez karne vaali lekhikaon ke bich bhi paryaapt matbhinnata he
 Actually, the real challenge of any female creator is to bring an alternative narrative vision
 iske abhaav main stri kii purush nirmit chhavi ko dhawast karke ek swatantra chhavi nahin gadhi ja sakati
 Mamta Kalia's full emphasis is on creating an independent image of the woman and not on making her the number two in the name of female advocacy like others

 bijepi ne is pad ke liye kishan kathore kaa naam prastaavit kiya tha lekin baad main ise waapas le liya gaya
 It was time to withdraw the nomination at 10:30 in the morning

 For this, a meeting of all the parties took place in which this decision was taken

 But we have decided to withdraw his name
 duusari ore ensipi netaa chagan bhujabal ne kaha ki vipaksh ne spikar pad ke liye ummidavaar khadaa kiya tha lekin kuch vidhayakon kii maang ko dekhte hue or spikar pad kii maryaada ke maddenjar unhone apana ummidavaar waapas le liya he
 Now its election will be uncontested
 ab cabinet vistaar par najraspikar ke chunaav ke alaava ab uddhav sarkaar kecabinetvistaar par bhi najar he
 It is believed that there will be a cabinet expansion of the Uddhav government in the first week of December, in which 14 ministers can take oath
 sutron ke anusaar uddhav sarkaar main siem samet shivasena ke kul 16 mantri, ensipi ke 15 mantri aurcongresske 12 mantri shaamil honge
 Sonal Nikam, a resident of Vadgaon Gupta in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, bought the Mahindra Company's Scorpio S8 new car from the Mahindra showroom on Dussehra
 do din baad gaadi chalaate hue gaadi ke brake kharaab hone se sonal ne stone corner ke ek mahindra company ke sarvice stesan par repering ke jate hi unhen pataa chalaa ki yah nai gaadi dusre ke naam par register he
 On hearing this, Sonal Mahindra showroom reached to inquire about this, the owner of the showroom expelled Sonal Nikam from the showroom
 baad main sonal ne police thane main shikaayat darj kii, lekin police ne koi karwai nahin kii
 When Sonal filed private gun in Ahmednagar District Court, the court ordered to register a case against the owner of the Mahindra company with the showroom owner under fraud, then this morning, the Mahindra company owner and showroom owner were booked at MIDC police station in Ahmednagar
 Have done maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav nateezon ke baad jis tarah ke ghatnakram saamne aae, usase ye saaf he ki ye aisa rajya he jo centre dwaara iske liye nirdhaarit har maandand ko dhata bataata rahaa he or apane logon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye har sanstha ko chunauti detaa rahegaa
 To understand this entire context and glory story, we have to remember how Chhatrapati Shivaji's determination has weakened the dominance of the rulers of Delhi
 2014 ke baad modi or shah ke netritv main bijepi kaa udai abhootpurv rahaa he
 The party has strengthened its hold in the 2019 elections
 centre main bhaajapa ke udai ke peeche kamjor vipaksh to vajah tha hi
 At the same time, the party's own allies paid the price, but it was clear from the assembly elections held just after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections that the public did not accept the dominance of any one party
 bijepi haryana or maharashtra main clin sweep kaa daawa kar rahi thi, lekin nattejey isse ulat rahe
 Talking about Maharashtra, the challenge in bjp's path here was its long-time ally Shiv Sena
 shivasena, ensipi or congress maharashtra main kal sarkaar banaaenge
 BJP and Shiv Sena remained together for nearly three decades
 har utaar-chadhaav main donon dalon kaa saath bana rahaa
 Whether in power or not
 un dinon bhi, jab laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main party rajya main apni jagah banane main juty thi or bala sahab thakare kii shivasena samarthan main thi or tab bhi jab amit shah or uddhav thakare ke rup main donon dalon ko nayaa netritv mila
 However, after the change of leadership of both parties, the situation also changed and in 2014 Shiv Sena took a different route
 haalanki chunaav ke baad vah phir endie main laut ai
 However, the division of power in the state was not equal, which led to a rift in the alliance
 lekin shivasena ne gathbandhan ke rup main mili janadesh ko sweekaar karte hue maharashtra ke logon ke hit ko sarvopari rakhaa or ise isi rup main sweekaar kiya
 Uddhav Thackeray remembered his father Bala Saheb Thackeray after being declared the CM candidate
 ek aisi kshetreey party, jiske vot share main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main badhotaree hui, jo apni kshetreey aakankshaon ko majboot karte hue gathbandhan se pare aage badhanaa chaahati thi, use har kadam par naakaami naseeb hui
 In such a situation, it was the right time for Shiv Sena to make its place and strengthen it
 aisa prathit ho rahaa tha ki is gathbandhan kaa uddeshy bijepi ke liye ek kshetreey party ko samaapt karnaa or rajya main prabhutv jamaana bhar rah gaya tha
 Despite all the disagreements, the pre-poll alliance between the two parties came to an end with BJP President Amit Shah's promise to Uddhav Thackeray that the power sharing with the top post would be equaled
 bijepi kii rajya ikai ke anurodh par shivasena kuch siton par apana daawa chhodane ko bhi taiyaar ho gai
 Despite this, the election results were neither in line with bjp's expectations nor the Shiv Sena's
 iske baad devendra fadanvis ne bagaiyr shivasena se baat kiye or tamaam vaadon ko darkinar karte hue khud ko mukhyamantri ghoshit kar diya, jo 'taabut main aakhri keel' sabit hua
 This also made it clear that the BJP wanted to share power with the Shiv Sena, but the alliance was not ready to fulfill religion and responsibility
 iske saath hi yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki is baar shivasena kisi tarah kii beijjati bardaast karne ke mood main nahin he
 The BJP and Shiv Sena alliance lasted for nearly three decades
 iske baad aisi ghatnaayen huin, jisaki koi script riter kalpana tak nahin kar saktaa tha
 The BJP, which had earlier informed the Governor that it would neither form the government nor join any coalition, suddenly took a U-turn and tried to crack the Sharad Pawar's party NCP to reach power
 satta tak pahunchane kii itani jaldi thi ki rajyapal or raashtrapati karyaalay ko rabar stamp bana diya
 However, he had no hope that the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress would compete to such an extent
 teenon dalon ne sanvaidhanik niyam-kaayadon ko taak par rakhkar bani is sarkaar se nipatane ke liye puure ji-jaan ke saath ranneeti banaai
 On the one hand the NCP was engaged in uniting all its mlas, on the other hand the Shiv Sena was busy in arranging to keep the mlas safe
 vahiin duusari taraf, congress ne puure damakham ke saath supreme court main yah ladaai ladi
 mlas of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress demonstrated strength
 bijepi kii aguwai main tamaam sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon ko taak par rakhkar satta hasil karnaa adarsh ban gaya he or is tarah ke jue ko 'masterstroke' kaha jane laga he
 Especially the dead media needs to exercise restraint before calling any such action a 'chanakya policy'
 desh kii janata ne arunachal pradesh, uttarakhand, goa, meghalaya or karnataka main dekha he ki kis tarah jaruri sankhya na hone ke baavjood bijepi satta kii kursi tak pahunchi
 Maharashtra was not inclined to take any such step and the Supreme Court ensured that the Constitution remained paramount
 uddhav thakare or unki patni rashmi rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ke saath
 
 
 This battle of Maharashtra has seen a historic and significant change in the dynamics of India's power
 bhale hi shivasena or congress pehali baar gathbandhan sarkaar chalaane ke liye saath ai hon, lekin donon ke bich yah sahyog itihaas main darj ho gaya he
 Two important regional parties like Sharad Pawar's party NCP and Shiv Sena have come together to give Maharashtra the governance it deserves
 ve log, jo yah kah rahe hai ki yah gathbandhan zyada din chalegaa, ve ek baar phir galatiyon kaa 'masterstroke' chal rahe hai
 This alliance has to remain strong, so that the principles of democracy can be further strengthened and the balance of power is maintained
 vahiin, duusari taraf vibhinn rajyon kii satta kii bhagidaari main disambar 2017 main 71 pratishat se november 2019 main 40 pratishat tak khisak chuki bijepi ko nishchit taur par apni un ranneetiyon or raajnneetik yuddhayaason ke bare main dobaaraa sochane kii jarurat he, jinaki vajah se vah apane tamaam vaadon or sahyogiyon se alag ho rahi he

 Both sides can agree on this
 ikbaal ansarimamle main pakshakaar rahe hashil ansaari ke bete ikbaal ansaari kaa kahana he ki parisar main hi ram mandir or masjid kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 The High Court ruled on this basis

 Ayodhya's Hindus and Muslims came to a stage
 is dauraan mahant gyaandas ne kaha ki subramanyam swami ne ram mandir maamle ko ulajhaa diya he
 He said that Subramanian Swamy should keep his mouth shut on this matter

 ' Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Solan in Himachal Pradesh on Monday
 yahaan unhone kaha ki ye namdaar khuleam kah rahe hai ki modi kii chhavi bigaadna inkaa mishan he, lekin modi kaa mishan bharat kii chhavi ko puri duniya main sabase ooncha uthaanaa he
 Modi said that Namdar says that his mission is to defeat Modi, but Modi's mission is to win India
 congress kii sthiti aaj desh main vot katua party kii ho gai he
 Modi is not saying this, the people of Congress themselves say
 iskaa ek hi kaaran he, inkaa ahankaar
 The Congress feels that whatever the Namdar family says is right
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress ke ye netaa apane purvajon ke naam par vot maangate hai, lekin jab unke karnaamon par sawaal puche jate hai, to ye kehete hai- hua to hua! hua to hua kii isi soch ne bharat kii raksha niti or sainya niti ko itnaa kamjor kar diya
 Narendra Modi said that Shimla has become the first place in the country to join the Udaan scheme
 tourism ko pramot karne ke liye kalka-shimla ke bich pehali baar transperent vista dom coach hamane joda he
 These facilities will greatly benefit the tourism sector here
 unhone kaha ki solan kii sabji mandi to nae bharat ke krishi vyapaar kaa model he

 Modi said 'the big countries of the world are still struggling with digitization', but in India, the power of mobile, Aadhaar and Jan Dhan account is giving strength to the poorest of the poor
 Rupay card or BHIM app aaj himachal ke gaanv-gaanv main upyog ho rahaa he, lekin aaj china raksha saamagree main aatmanirbhar hi nahin, balki sansar main iskaa bada niryaatak bhi he
 In contrast, India is today the largest importing country in the world
 bharat itnaa kuch aayaat karata rahaa, congress kahati rahi- hua to hua
 The PM said that these great dignitaries do not respect the honor and valor of our soldiers, our army
 ye hamaare senadhyaksh ko gali kaa gunda kehete hai, vayusena adhyaksh ko jhootha kehete hai
 When someone says that it has gone wrong, they answer - it happened
 unhone kaha 'sena ke apmaan, desh kii suraksha main naakaam rahane kaa yahi daagdar itihaas he, jiske kaaran congress sargical strike, air strike par baat hi nahin karti
 You tell me - by acting on the terrorists, we did it right? In comparison to the earlier government, defense production has increased by 80 percent during the last five years

 Prime Minister Modi said that from the ground to the skies, these people committed so many scams that there was no day when the news of their exploits was not published in the newspapers
 aaj bhi namdaar or unke rishtedaar jamaanat par baahar hai
 Today, Congress has become the vote cutter party in the country
 ye modi nahin kah rahaa he khud kangras ke log kehete hai
 The only reason for this is their arrogance
 inako lagata he ki namdaar parivaar jo bhi kahe vahi sahi he
 He said that the Congress and its great allies, in their ten years of rule, postponed every major decision and took the decisions in such a way that the country suffered
 atal ji ne congress ko 8 pratishat kii dar se viksit hota bharat saunpa tha or wo bhi ek arthshaastri pradhanmantri ko saunpa tha
 If the Congress had retained it during its 10 years of rule, then from where the country would have reached in 10 years today

 agar viraat ne 24 june ko hone vaale series ke aakiri match main apni dabangai nahin dikhaai to isse team ke saath-saath viraat ko bhi bada nuksaan hoga

 ve meri ore nahin dekh rahe hai, vah meri ankhon main nahin dekh sakate hai, kyonki piem ke paas sach nahin he
 This is the truth
 puure desh ne abhi dekha he
 i have spoken clearly about PM
 piem apni aankh meri aankh main nahin daal sakate
 19
 piem ne china ke raashtrapati ke saath nadi ke kinare jhula jhula tha
 At that time, thousands of Chinese soldiers were within the border of India
 20
 Our soldiers showed their strength, they stood in front of China
 magar usee ke kuch din baad piem china jate hai
 Spoken without an agenda
 doklam kaa mudda nahin uthaaya
 This was China's agenda
 sainikon ko piem ne dhokhaa diya
 This is the truth, it cannot be reversed
 21
 Farmer says, PM you waived two and a half million crores of India's richest businessmen
 haath jodakar aapse kahata he, hamaara bhi thodaa karja maaf kar dijie
 The finance minister says that your debt will not be forgiven
 22
 Prices of petrol and diesel are decreasing in the world, but are increasing in the country
 23
 In MSP, PM has given you the benefit of ten thousand crores in the whole country
 karnataka kii sarkaar ne ek pradesh main hi 34 hajaar karod kaa phayda diya
 24
 kuch hi din pehle iconomist magazine ke cover par likhaa tha, hindustan apni mahilaon kii raksha nahin kar paa rahaa he
 Other countries have such an opinion
 25
 Dalits, tribals, minorities are being tortured all over the country
 log maare ja rahe hai, kuchle ja rahe hai
 Is it not of India? piem ke munh se ek shabd kyon nahin nikalataa
 They answer in their speech
 ulta unke mantri jaakar haar daalate hai
 26
 piem or amit shah donon bhinn prakaar ke rajaneta hai
 They are not like us
 ham satta se baahar rah sakate hai
 But PM and Shah cannot stay out of power
 27
 When the proceedings were adjourned for a while, i went in and the members of the opposition congratulated me
 unhone kaha ki bahut acha bole
 Your members said hands together and said very well
 28
 The Akali Dal leader was looking at me with a smile
 ye jo feeling puure desh main he
 Our job is to add this feeling
 29
 The entire opposition and a lot of your people are going to together defeat the PM in the elections
 30
 You will think in my heart there is anger, anger, hatred against PM
 magar main dil se kahata hum, main piem, bijepi aresas kaa abhaari hum ki inhone mujhe congress kaa matlab sikhaaya
 Taught the meaning of Hindustani
 iske liye dil se dhanyavad
 You explained to me religion, Shivji and what it means to be a Hindu

 Pakistan has been stunned after the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and the abolition of special state status
 isko lekar pehle pakistan ne bharat ko gidadbhabhaki di or phir anuchhed 370 ko hataae jane ko yuddh aparaadh qaraar diya
 After this, Pakistan announced the end of trade relations with India and now it has announced to take the matter to UN Security Council and International Court of Justice
 haalanki kangaal ho chuke pakistan ko antarrashtriya manch par munh kii hi khaani padegi
 The resolution of the 1948 resolution of the United Nations Security Council that Pakistan has been repeating has (itself) scrapped that resolution
 lau professor dow
 Rajesh Dubey says that Pakistan attacked the United Nations Security Council resolution in 1965 by attacking India
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad bhi is rijolution ke samaapt kii baat kah chukaa he
 The condition of the resolution of 1948 was that no country would attack each other, but Pakistan broke this condition
 lihaaja ab us rijolution kaa koi astitv hi nahin bachaa he
 He said that even if Pakistan tried to raise the Kashmir issue on the international stage, it would have to face it
 dube kaa kahana he ki ab charchaa pioke or aksai china par honi chahie
 pok and Aksai China are also parts of India
 antarrashtriya maamalon ke jaankaar dow rajesh dube kaa kahana he ki isse bhi ahm baat yah he ki anuchhed 370 khatm hone ke baad se jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa ban chukaa he or ab is maamle main pakistan hi nahin, balki duniya kaa koi desh dakhal nahin de saktaa he
 Under international law, no country can interfere in the internal affairs of another sovereign country
 bharat ek samprabhu raashtra he or agar koi desh bharat ke antarik maamle main dakhal detaa he, to isko samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan mana jayega
 Therefore, Pakistan has no basis for taking the Kashmir issue to the UN Security Council
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main dow rajesh dube ne bataaya ki antarrashtriya nyaayalay main bhi pakistan is maamle ko nahin le ja paaegaa, kyonki antarrashtriya nyaayalay tabhi kisi maamle kii sunwaayee karata he, jab donon desh sahamat hote hai
 Dubey says that India has already been against hearing the International Court of Justice on the Kashmir issue
 bharat saaf kar chukaa he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich shimla or lahore samjhauta hue hai
 In which both countries have agreed to settle the mutual dispute by bilateral talks
 lihaaja bharat kii sahmati ke bagaiyr antarrashtriya nyaayalay pakistan kii apil par sunwaayee nahin kar saktaa he
 Law professor Dr
 Rajesh Dubey says that bilateral agreements are considered the most important at the international level
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar kinhin do deshon ke bich dwipaksheeya samjhauta he, to unke bich ke vivaad dwipaksheeya samjhaute ke tahat hi sulajhaaye jaaenge
 The United Nations cannot compel the two countries to settle a mutual dispute under the International Convention or any other law bypassing a bilateral agreement

 com / vlqhuy67rb— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) May 8, 2019 After this, Arjun arrives at Preity's house, where Preity's father catches both of them
 arjuna ko ghar se baahar nikaal phenk dete hai
 Preity's father opposes her and Arjun's relationship
 kyonki ve donon alag-alag jatiyon ke hai
 After this Arjun gives 6 hours to Preeti and asks for the final decision, if Preity does not come to them within 6 hours then that relationship will end
 is ghatana ke baad, priti ke mata-pita beti se phone le lete hai, jisaki vajah se wo arjuna se baat nahin kar paati
 After this, she arrives at Arjun's house
 par tab tak tak arjuna gusse main morphine inject karata letaa he
 And he remains unconscious for two days

 When Arjun comes to know about this marriage, he goes to his house and creates a ruckus
 arjuna ke saath marpet kii jaati he or seen creat karne ke liye use giraftaar kar liya jaataa he
 Arjun's father drives his son out of the house
 iske baad arjuna ko nashe kii lat pad jaati he
 He is always drunk
 drugs yaa sharaab pikar oparation karata he or deehydration kii vajah se gir jaataa he
 In one case, Arjun's blood sample is taken and drugs are found in it
 jiske baad arjuna par mukadmaa chalata he
 With this, there are many more twists and turns in the film
 arjuna paaglon kii tarah idhar-udhar bhatakta he
 However later he comes home
 film ke aakhir main arjuna ko pataa chalata he ki priti ne kisi se shaadi nahin kii hoti he wo ain maukey par shaadi tod detii he or arjuna ke bachche kii maa banane vaali he
 When Arjun is aware of this, both are together again and start living happily
 ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kabir singh kii kahani arjuna reddy se kitna mail khaati he
 Because the teaser of Kabir Singh and the scene shown in the new poster are exactly those of Arjun Reddy
 vaise shahid kapur ne kaha he ki rimek main kaaphi pherbadal kiye gaye hai
 China today reacted cautiously to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks about the tendency of 'expansionism' in some countries, saying that it was unclear in what context he was saying this and that China reminded him of his previous comments , In which he described India and China as strategic partners

 After all, what has happened to actor Salman Khan
 kabhi to ve katrina ko apane dil se nikaalane kii baat karte hai or kabhi brallep kii khabar ko sire se nakaar dete hai
 Salman, who arrived in Delhi on Sunday in connection with Dabang's promotion, was explaining to the media that he still wanted Katrina
 katrina se brallep ko lekar jab salmaan se sawaal kiya gaya to vah na sirf baukhala uthe balki saaf kah diya ki unka or katrina kaa brallep nahin hua he
 On hearing this statement of Salman, it seems that he does not want to leave Katrina with him
 salmaan na sirf media ko single hone kaa matlab samajhaate dikhe balki is baat par bhi jor dete rahe ki ve or katrina saath-saath hai
 So has Salman turned away from his own words? kya salmaan ne brallep ko ek mazaaq samaj liya he
 We are saying this because Salman said in his statement two weeks ago that there is no relation between him and Katrina
 aakhir salmaan itani jaldi apane hi bayaan se palat kyon gaye
 It seems from Sallu Mian's talk that something is still going on between him and Katrina and they do not want to lose Katrina at any cost

 yahaan ke chaudaa bazaar ke paas log ravan dahan dekhne ke liye ikattha hue or usee vakt jalandhar se amritsar ja rahi train kii chapet main aane se 59 logon kii dardanaak maut ho gai

 Many people ran away to avoid the train, causing injuries

 And he also died

 She does not understand how she will spend her entire life with an 8-month-old baby
 dalbir ko ghar se uski patni ne hi sajaakar bheja tha 
 Dalbir's wife said that Dalbir had left the house prematurely to do the make-up of Rama and Laxman, but what he knew was that becoming Ravana this time is going to overwhelm him

 shef prabhu bataati hai ki yah unke or kichan main unke saathiyon ke plate sajaane ke tareeke par apana asar daalane laga he
 What happens is that as soon as the plate is exposed, the first thing a customer does is take out a cellphone from the pocket, take a picture of it and post it online
 yah turat-phurat kaa faisla hota he ki dish acchhee he yaa buree
 So Prabhu started taking photographs of himself in the kitchen, so that he could know in advance about his impact on the customer

 In their kitchens, they now ask the question, "will it look good when put on Instagram and foodspotting?" This proliferation of food photos has increased to the extent of pornography
 yahi vajah he ki isse judi websiton ke saude lakhon dollaron tak pahunch gaye hai
 The American website foodspotting is one of the largest websites in the world, which has photos and recommendations on food

 com / iovtyjcat2 — India Today (@indiatoday) January 20, 2018 film kaa naam :omertadiarector:hansal mehtaster cast:rajkumaar raav, rajesh tailang, rupinder nagara, keval arodivadhi:1 ghanta 38 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3
 The duo of 5 Star National Award winning directors Hansla Mehta and Rajkumar Rao have given excellent films like Shahid, City Lights, Aligarh
 ab ye jodi omerta ko lekar ek baar phir se alag tarah kaa cinema darshakon ko dene ja rahi he
 The film has already been shown in many festivals where it has also been praised
 is film ko sensor main manjuuri ke liye kaaphi papad belane pade
 After much effort, it is ready for release somehow
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kisi bani he yah film
 
 
 The story of the film is Omar Shahid Sheikh (rajkumar Rao), who was born in Pakistan, but has been raised and raised in London
 omaar, bosnia main musalaamanon par hue hamalon kaa badla lene ke liye pehle pakistan jaataa he or phir vahaan se bharat ke dilli main rahakar kai ghatnaon ko anjaam detaa he
 The film deals with Omar's activities from 1992 to 2002
 jisamen dilli main videshiyon kii kidnaping, kandahar vimaan samjhauta, world trade centre par hamalaa or saath hi british jarnlist danniel parl kii hatya ke saath-saath or bhi kai ahm ghatnaon kaa zikr he
 You have to watch the film for how all the references are shown in the film
 omerta kii shooting ke vakt maansik sthiti asahaj ho gai thi: rawakhir kyon dekhen?yah film maatr 98 minute kii he jo ki hansal mehta kii aaj tak kii sabase choti film he
 But Rajkummar Rao has performed very well once again
 wo omaar ke kirdaar main puri tarah se lipt najar aate hai or kai aise seen ban pade hai jahaan rajkumaar raav aapako bilkul alag avatar main dekha ja saktaa he
 We can also say that making this film was not an easy task
 aisi film hansal mehta jaise filmmekar hi bana sakate hai
 The background score of the film is very good
 kai aise seen hai jo aapako sochane par vivash karte hai ki kya sach main itnaa khatarnaak aatankwaadi tha omaar
 The research work of the film is amazing
 film dekhte hue aisa bilkul nahin lagata ki ise banane ke liye hansal mehta ne ek baar bhi omaar yaa uske parivaar se mulaaqaat nahin kii ho
 The pace of the film is very impressive
 chat sho main rajkumaar raav ne actress ke saamne 'utaare kapade', videokamajora kadifilm main kuch bhi aisa nahin he, jo kamjor dikhe
 However, when this film was shown at the festival, there were many scenes, which after being censored, viewers will no longer be able to watch
 haalanki jis tarah se hansal mehta ne film ko banaaya he wo kaaphi umdaa he
 If you are an adult, you cannot miss the film

 Wherever Kejriwal paid attention, whether Punjab or Goa, the success rate has been seen by everyone
 tiwari ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal permanent vipasana main jaaen or dilli main phir se chunaav hon taaki log apana netaa chun len
 'AAP' MLA Sanjeev Jha defended his Chief Minister while answering the question of opponents
 unhone kaha ki 'arvind kejariwal aaj se nahin pichley 20 saal se vipasana ke liye jate rahe hai
 There is no big deal in this

 But work is going on very fast in the government and will continue
 siem kii nai jimmedaari ke sawaal par jha ne kaha ki baat jimmedaari kii nahin he

 unhone kaha, meraa maananaa he ki kejariwal ji ke 10 din kii chuttee par jane se itane bavaal nahin hone chahie
 'kejriwal will go on Vipassana for 10 days
 Let us tell you that this time Arvind Kejriwal will go to Vipassana Center in Igatpuri near Mumbai in Maharashtra on 10 September

 in 10 dinon tak dilli ke mukhyamantri ko naa hi akhbaar mayssar hoga naa hi vipasana centre main unhen tivi yaa mobile phone istemaal karne kii ijaajat hogi
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will not even be allowed to talk to anyone during the 10-day Vipassana session
 somvaar ko hi unhone dhai saal main pehali baar mukhyamantri ke alaava kisi vibhaag kii jimmedaari lee or aalaa adhikariyon ko talab kar report bhi maangi
 After the Vipassana session, whether Kejriwal will start a new political fight, it will be known only after his arrival

 cabinet ke note par hastakshar naa karne vaale danix (DANICS) ke do afasaron ko dilli sarkaar dwaara suspend karne se tanatani bad gai he
 With this decision, there is a possibility of re-engagement between the government and the Lieutenant Governor, as the authority to suspend senior officers is only for the Lieutenant Governor, who can do so only after getting permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs
 sarkaar ke is faisle se naaraaz danix ke sabhi adhikariyon ne ek din kii chuttee par jane kaa elaan kar diya he

 According to Satyendra Jain's confirmation of the suspension, both the suspended officers Yashpal Garg and Subhash Chandra were serving as special secretaries
 ve sabase oonchi grad keprashasnic adhikarihain
 It is being told that the cabinet note which the two officials refused to sign is related to the increase in the salary of government lawyers and jail staff
 dilli sarkaar ke mantri satyendra jain ne bhi donon adhikariyon ko suspend kiye jane kii pushti kii he
 What is the rule? According to the rules, only the President has the right to fix the salary of these employees
 haalanki uparajpal kii sahmati se is sambandh mennotificationajari kiya ja saktaa he, lekin mantri ne bina uparajyapal kii anumati ke hi adhikariyon par notification main hastakshar karne kaa dabaav banaaya
 The authorities refused to sign, citing the rules as the Lieutenant Governor himself has instructed them not to sign any such paper without their consent
 danix association ne turant bulaai baithkadonon adhikariyon ko suspend kiye jane se naaraaz danix association ne fouran baithak bulaai
 It was decided in the meeting that all the officials in support of both will go on mass leave on Thursday

 Comedian-actor Kapil Sharma, who recently appeared in the flop film Firangi, has agreed for a second innings as a comedian on TV
 unhone ek phani video share kiya he
 His comedy act has become fun in this
 kapil ne apane instagram par 'junior arora sahab' ke naam se ek video post kiya he
 The video is being linked to Kapil's return preparations on TV
 bataa den ki 2017 main kapil ko lekar kai vivaad saamne aae
 The channel stopped his comedy show on the pretext of giving him a break
 kapil sharma kii TV par vaapasi, kamedi sho ke duusare sijan kii taiyaariyaan shuruisase pehle firangi ke pramotion ke dauraan kapil khud kah chuke hai ki nae saal main wo kapil sharma sho ke saath tivi par vaapasi karenge
 Earlier in a report, Kapil Sharma Show Season 2 to 2018 talked about Kapil's big bang
 isamen bataaya gaya tha ki sho kii taiyaariyaan bhi shuru ho gai hai
 The promo is being shot
 kam back sho ke promo kaa shoot janvari ke pehle hafte main kiye jane kii baat kahi gai thi
 It is believed that the Kapil Fresh video may be part of the same promo shoot
 kya sunil grover bhi karenge vaapasi?junior arora sahib 😂 on Snapchat - kapilsharmak9a post shared bykapil Sharma(@kapilsharma) onjan 3, 2018 at 10:32am pstkapila ke is kam back sho main unki kamedi team kaa hissaa koun-koun diggaj banenge, philhal khulaasa nahin hua he
 Other details are also not revealed
 mana ja rahaa he ki kapil ke sho main unke kai puraane saathi najar aa sakate hai
 In some reports, Sunil Grover may also return from this show
 haalanki hindustan times ko die ek intervyuu main sunil ne kaha, sho ko chhodane ke baad unhone jagah-jagah live events kiye
 He received much love and respect
 sunil ne kaha kapil kaa sho chhodane ko lekar unhen koi afsos nahin he
 He will be returning to TV soon
 haalanki sunil ne yah nahin bataaya ki wo dobaaraa kapil ke saath kaam karenge yaa nahin
 Kapil Sharma cheated, despite promises not made Aaj Tak till date Kapil's show will succeed? However after Firangi's failure, the big question is whether Kapil will be able to get back the lost fame from his new show
 darasal, pichley sijan main badi-badi hastiyaan kapil sharma ke sho par najar aati rahi hai
 But will this happen this time too? Saying this is also natural because this year Kapil has canceled shoot on shoot with Shahrukh Khan, Ajay Devgan, Amitabh Bachchan and many stars
 ise lekar kai tarah kii charchaaen huin or kapil sharma ke kaam karne ke andaaj par sawaal uthaa
 Bringing comedy flavor to the show on TV will be a major challenge for not only Kapil but also the makers

 snaan, daan or visheshkar pitaron ke tarpan ke liye amavasya ko behad shubhakari or mangalakaari mana jaataa he
 Although Amavasya comes every month, but the significance of Bhadrapad i
e
 Bhadrapad Amavasya of Bhado month is very high
 darasal, bhado krishna ke janm kaa maheenaa he or is dauraan padane vaali amavasya or poornima ke vrath kaa prabhaav kai guna mana jaataa he
 Bhadrapada Amavasya or Pithori Amavasya is also special because on this day Kusha means grass is collected for religious purposes
 manyata he ki dharmik kaaryon ke liye pithori amavasya ke din ikattha kii gai ghaas bahut faldaai hoti he
 Apart from this, on the Pithori Amavasya, women fast for their children and husbands and worship Mother Durga

 kendra sarkaar ne november main sarvaadhik prachlit 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko gaiyrkanoonee qaraar dete hue iske evaj main 2000 rupee kii nai karency jari kar di
 For more than 40 days, there has been a competition across the country to get new currency instead of old currency
 vahiin rigerv bank ke printing press main nai karency kii chapai kaa kaam bina ruke chal rahaa he
 Despite this, the common man does not seem to get any relief
 500 or 1000 rupee kinotbandikar 2000 rupee ke nae note jari karnaa ek galati thi jiske kaaran beete 40 dinon main lagaataar koshish ke baavjood desh se karency sankat talane kaa naam nahin le rahaa- jaaniye kaise
 
 
 1
 notebandi se pehle desh main sarvaadhik prachlan main 500 or 1000 kii note thi
 Both the currencies were the most preferred currency for everyday expenses besides being suitable for black money
 1000 rupee kii karency ko kharch karne main bhale thodi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha lekin 500 rupee kii karency bina kisi dikkat ke kharch kii jaati thi
 2
 8 november ke baad aam aadmi ko atm se 2000 rupee kii ek note milanaa shuru hui vahiin bank se nikasi karne par use ek baar main adhiktam paanch note mili (saptahik vidroval seemaa 24,000 lekin ek baar nikasi par vaastavik seemaa 10,000 rupee maatr)
 The new currency printing of 500 rupees started after the ban on demonetisation
 rigerv bank kii kavayad notebandi ke baad sirf 2000 rupee kii nai karency ko cirkulation main laane kaa prayaas karne kaa tha
 3
 bank or atimase simit maatra main sirf 2000 kii nai karency milane ke kaaran aam aadmi ko ise bhunaane main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He was forced to buy a big deal either to run this note, otherwise he had to mortgage a 2000 note to make future purchases at the retail store next to the house
 2000 rupee kii nai note ke saath 100 or 50 kii nai note ko jari karne kaa kaam bhi nahin kiya
 4
 notebandi se aam aadmi ke paas ghar main immergency fund main padaa 10,000 rupee se 1 lakh rupee tak bank main jamaa ho gaya
 This once again made the people feel the need to keep the new 2000 note in the house as an emergency fund
 iskaa sidhaa asar bainkon dwaara 2000 kii note se bazaar main liquidity badhaane par padaa or 2000 kii note ko apni jarurat ke hisaab se logon ne bataur immergency fund gharon main stock kar liya
 5
 notebandi kii sabase zyada maar desh memblackmanirakhane vaale kaarobaari, netaa or adhikari par padane kii ummid thi
 It was the largest segment in the economy, which had the most black money accumulated in the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 bainkon dwaara jari 2000 rupee kii nai karency is tabake liye saugat bani
 The one who got a new note by paying jugaad or commission in the bank, took advantage of the large denomination and secured his black money in a new note of 2000 rupees
 isi tabake ne aam aadmi ke paas pahunch rahi simit karency ko bhi pehla mauka milte hi apane paas sanchit kar liya
 The central government used a new currency of just Rs 2000 to replace 86 per cent of the country's total currency in the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees
 iske chalate vyavhaarik dikkaton ke saath-saath kaledhan ko canwart karne kaa kaam aasaani se sambhav ho sakaa
 The decision of demonetisation was taken only to curb corruption and black money in the country
 kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank ko 2000 rupee kii badi dinomination kii jagah 50, 100 or 500 rupee kii nai karency ke jariye bazaar kii liquidity ko badalane kaa kaam karnaa tha
 The Reserve Bank data after 40 days of demonetisation, and the 2000 notes recovered in the impressions of the Income Tax Department and the CBI, are clearly indicating that the demonetisation of large denominations for demonetisation was a mere mistake

 The exit poll once again showed that every issue is dwarfed by Modi's Gujarat model
 gujarat chunaav se pehle dhruv taare kii tarah chamake hardik patel, alpesh thakor or jignesh mevani bhi itihaas kii baat hote dikh rahe
 In such a situation, the question is whether the Patidars' question has stopped in front of the development formula of Mododi? Did the anger of the Dalits not show any effect? The hardships of the farmers were buried under the carpet of Vibrant Gujarat - that is, every question which resonated from the political forums during the Gujarat elections, which gave oxygen to the Congress, political uproar through street rallies, it was submerged under the sub-poll
 yaa phir 22 baras kii bijepi kii satta ke daur main siem se piem bane modi kaa jaadu 31 reliyon ke jariye kuch is tarah chadhataa chalaa gaya ki gujarat ke votaron ko or kuch dikhaai hi nahin diya
 It is evident that the exit poll results have given rise to these questions
 agsit pole ke nateezon ko agar sahi maan len to phir congress hi nahin balki tamaam raajnneetik dalon ko sochna hoga ki chunaav jeetne ke liye lade jate hai naa ki harkar loktantr kaa naaraa buland karne ke liye
 With what preparation will Rahul Gandhi prepare himself for 2019, everyone's eyes will be on it now
 agsit pole main ek khaas baat yah bhi he ki is baar 2012 or 2014 kii tulana main bijepi ke vot kam najar aa rahe hai
 On the other hand, there is a 5 percent increase in Congress vote and a 5 percent decrease in BJP vote
 aise main kya gujarat main bijepi congress ke bich kaa antar hi itnaa bada he ki congress kii kuch kamai bhi ‘haath’ ko khaali rakhe hue he or bijepi ke varchasv main aati kami bhi use chunavi jeet dilaa hi de rahi he
 The final truth is that these are the results of exit polls
 isliye 18 disbanr kaa intjaar karnaa hoga

 The political situation ensured that the superficial promise made at the time of the Union Budget on February 28 would have become a commitment only three weeks later because 20 mps of Nitish Kumar's party are very important and the JDU UPA government is premature Can save in the event of a fall

 lekin ve jaldbaaji main koi bhi faisla nahin lene vaale
 a senior party leader says that Nitish always follows the same principle - don't worry about anything until something happens
 vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa abhi nahin hui he
 This is a point at which senior JDU leader Sharad Yadav has been expressing displeasure
 unhone 26 march ko kataaksh karte hue kaha tha ki unhone is bare main sirf akhabaaron main padhaa he

 In the 2010 assembly elections, both of them got around 40 percent votes, due to which they managed to win 80 percent seats of Bihar
 agar ve gathbandhan se alag ho jate hai, to nitish ko kareeb 16-17 pratishat voton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he, jo 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko mila tha
 They may also have to lose the votes of the upper castes, who vote for the BJP and have recently become disenchanted with the Nitish government
 yah ek badi vajah he, jiske kaaran nitish bijepi se alag hone se hichakate hai
 If Nitish wants to break away from BJP, he will have to get 16 percent Muslim votes in his favor

 Nitish is not going to benefit more from the Congress than the BJP in terms of votes
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko keval 8 pratishat vot hi mili the
 The reason for Nitish's attempt to move towards the Congress may be to stop the alliance of opposition forces — the rjd-ljp-congress alliance can defeat him if Nitish contests alone
 nitish nishchit rup se lalu ko post rakhana chaahate hai or is dharna ko bhi jhuthalaanaa chaahate hai ki lalu dhire-dhire phir se bihar main apni pakad bana rahe hai

 congress netaa chandra prakaash joshi kaa janm 29 july, 1950 ko rajasthan ke nathdwara main hua tha
 He holds a degree in law, a master's degree in physics as well as a doctorate in psychology
 joshi ne apane shaikshanik karier kii shuruuaat udaipur ke em college main ek manovigyaan ke professor kii rup main kii thi
 If we talk about his political career, then he started it as a student leader
 vah pehali baar saal 1980 main rajsamand jile ke nathdwara vidhansabha seat se vidhayak chune gaye the
 While a Congress MLA, he took charge of departments like Education, Rural Development, Public Health, Information Technology
 rajya main computer shiksha shuru karne main inhone mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Chandra Prakash Joshi was given additional charge of Railways following the resignation of Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy as Railway Minister, Road Transport and Highways Minister
 artical 370 ke mudde par centre kii bhartiya janata party ko apane sahyogi nitish kumaar kii janata dal united se niraashaa haath lagi
 Leaders of Janata Dal United in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha not only gave a speech in protest but also boycotted the House
 jabaki is mudde kii gambhirtha or janata main isko lekar aam logon ke bich jo sarkaar ke prati bhaavana he uske baad bispi, aam aadmi party jaise vipakshi dal sarkaar ke samarthan main aage aae
 But the question is that despite all this, why did Nitish stick to the old line and principle of his party on this issue
 iske liye aapako paanch varsh ke ek ghatnakram par bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kaa coment jaananaa hoga
 This was on 18 May 2014 when Nitish Kumar announced his resignation after being reduced to just two seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 uske baad sabko lag rahaa tha ki unhone istipha dene kii aupchaarikta keval puri kii he or agle ek se do din main ve istipha waapas le lenge
 Then a senior leader of the Bihar BJP called a journalist and after the journalist said that under the pressure of the party leaders, Nitishji would be forced to withdraw the resignation, the BJP leader said that you are in a misunderstanding
 main jaanata hum ve bahut ziddi hai
 So once the decision is taken, the Chief Minister will be someone else
 haalanki usee samay bihar bhaajapa ke ek or netaa susheel modi kaa twit aayaa ki istipha naatak he or nitish apni kursi nahin chhod sakate
 But Nitish did not accept that he placed Jitan Ram Manjhi in his place but did not take back his resignation
 idhar pichley ek saptaah ke dauraan yah doosraa mauqaa tha jab nitish kumaar ke nirdesan main janata dal united ne, centre sarkaar dwaara prastaavit vah chaahe tripal talaaq kaa maamla ho yaa 370 kaa mudda, apane stand par punarvichaar karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 In the Lok Sabha, the leader of the JDU parliamentary party Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh said clearly that you should take any step in the fight against terrorism, we are with you
 lekin is vivaadaaspad mudde ko aapako chhedana nahin chahie tha
 Of course, the line must have been of Nitish Kumar, who, despite being in the Grand Alliance government with Lalu Yadav and the Congress party, supported the note closure according to his and Dr
 Lohia's principles
 saath hi saath jab sargical strike hui to ve pehle vipaksh ke netaa the jinhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kadam kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Nitish's stand on surgical strikes and demonetisation had made not only his colleagues but then leaders like Sharad Yadav present in his party quite uncomfortable
 unhone nitish kumaar se apane stand par punarvichaar karne kaa aagrah bhi kiya tha
 But Nitish did not budge even at that time
 yah baat alag he ki unhen ummid thi ki kam se kam 3-4 lakh karod rupee note bandi ke baad system main waapas nahin aaenge or centre sarkaar utane hi noton ko phir se jari karegi jo vikaas par karch hoga, jiskaa laabh bihar jaise rajyon ko mil saktaa he
 But there was neither nine heart oil nor Radha Nachi
 nitish kumaar yah baat karnaa nahin bhoolatey ki krime, karpshan or communalism se koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 When his Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav was accused of corruption and the RJD was not ready for his resignation, Nitish Kumar once again resigned and formed a government with the BJP
 pichley do varshon ke dauraan bijepi ke netaaon ko is baat kaa abhas ho gaya ki sarkaar kii aad main agar unhone sampradayik ghatnaon ko hawa di to gussaye nitish kumaar samjhauta nahin karenge
 Evidence of this came to light when the police in Nawada and Samastipur simultaneously sent several BJP leaders to jail, holding them responsible for the communal incidents during Ramnavami
 haalanki janata dal united ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki ve saare chote-mote mudde the, is baar yah mudda bijepi ke liye chunaav main kaaphi laabhadaayak or janata dal united ke stand ke kaaran iske liye nuksaandeh bhi ho saktaa he
 The BJP has fulfilled the promise made at the time of election
 usne achaanak jis tarah se loksabhaa or rajya sabha main bill ko paas karaayaa usko lekar logon main kaaphi utsaah he
 Evidence of this is also found in the fact that neither in Bengal nor in Hyderabad or Delhi, Bihar did any protests take place
 janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki filhal to sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he lekin haa bijepi ke saath bhavishya main rishton main vishwaas kii kami zarur aegi kyonki modi shah kii bhaajapa he, jo party ke andar apana virodh karne vaale ko nahin chhodte tab nitish kumaar ke prati naram rahenge, isaki guarantee koun degaa
 However, Nitish will have a sense of ground realities and would not like to lose his chair due to an issue
 lekin raajnneeti main jahaan har hafte sthiti badalati rahati he vahiin nitish kumaar ne tripal talaaq ke baad anuchhed 370 ke mudde par bhi sabit kar diya he ki kursi ke liye ve siddhanton ke saath samjhauta nahin karte
