 Justice Courier is questioning the Supreme Court itself
 ab sarkaar mangalvaar ko unke sawaalon kaa jawaab degi
 Justice Kurien had earlier written a letter to the Chief Justice and the Prime Minister objecting to the judge's conference on Good Friday
 supreme court se fadanvis sarkaar ko raahat milicort mangalvaar subah 10
 The Fadnavis government is relieved by the Supreme Court at the verdict at 30 pm
 adaalat ab is maamle main kal yani mangalvaar subah 10
 Will pronounce judgment at 30
 somvaar ko kareeb 2 ghante is maamle main adaalat main tikhi bahes chali jiske baad adaalat ne is par kal faisla sunaane kaa aadesh diya he
 There was a demand from ncp-congress and Shiv Sena that floor test be done within 24 hours
 24 ghante ke andar kai floor test huecourt main sunwaayee ko dauraan mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki floor test kabhi bhi ho saktaa he
 This decision is up to the speaker
 aaj wo kah rahe hai ki unke paas 54 vidhayak hai, kal main bhi ye kah saktaa hum
 It is the responsibility of the speaker to conduct floor test, what is the responsibility of the court in this? Mukul Rohatgi said that there is no question of the court
 yahaan par horse trading kaa sawaal nahin he, balki puraa group hi duusari ore chalaa gaya he
 If the governor says that there should be no floor test today and let them do their work
 isapar supreme court ne kaha ki abhi ye posishan nahin he
 There are many cases of this type, in which the floor test has been done within 24 hours
 solicytor general ne isapar jawaab diya ki ye rajyapal kaa faisla he, kya vidhansabha kaa agenda adaalat tay karegi? iske doorgaami parinaam honge
 The solicitor told that BJP has the support of 105 apnea, NCP 54 and 11 independents
 rajyapal ke paas sabhi vidhayakon kaa samarthan patr pahunchaa tha
 On this, the Supreme Court asked where is the letter in which the Governor had invited Fadnavis to form the government
 
 
 jab poocha ajit pavaar kii taraf se koun he?mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki pavaar parivaar main kya ho rahaa he, isse unhen matlab nahin he
 a Pawar is with me and in a court, he is not denying the signature wrong, but is alleging horse trading
 supreme court ne kaha ki ham yahaan par rajyapal ke bare main kuch nahin kah rahe hai, yahaan maamla alag he
 During this, Justice Khanna said that you are talking about yesterday, there is someone from Ajit Pawar here, after this Maninder Singh, who is appearing for Ajit Pawar, said that i am the NCP and i am the leader
 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki rajyapal ko ye bhi dekhnaa hoga ki koun sthai sarkaar degaa? ajit pavaar ke vakil ne kaha ki jo maine suchi di he wo puri tarah se sahi he
 However, the decision should be taken, whether it comes out of the court or the governor
 ensipi kii ore seabhishek manu singhvine daleel rakhi
 Singhvi said that if both sides are ready for the floor test then why are there delays
 unhone kaha ki agar kuch chipaaya ja rahaa he to farjivada hua he
 Ajit Pawar's letter is completely fake
 abhishek manu singhvi kii taraf se chitthee ko frod bataane parmukul rohtagibhadke or unhone kadi aapatti jataai
 During this, Abhishek Manu Singhvi spoke of handing over letters of support to 48 NCP, 56 Shiv Sena and 44 Congress mlas
 is par mukul rohtagi ne aapatti jataai, is par adaalat ne kaha ki agar aap ye daakhil karenge to mujhe unase jawaab lenaa hoga
 After which Abhishek Manu Singhvi withdrew the letter
 abhishek manu singhvi ne daleel di he ki court ko turant floor test kaa aadesh dena chahie, pehle protem spikar kii niyukti honi chahie
 BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke on Thursday clarified that the head-of-interest allegations against former Indian batsman VVS Laxman for being a shareholder in the head coach Anil Kumble's company are false

 com / syf23r6dse 21 disambar 2018 ko sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne ajeebogareeb faisla sunaaya
 Judge CJ Sharma of the special CBI court said that the evidence in the case is not sufficient, so all the 22 accused are acquitted
 itnaa hi nahin to jaj ne tulsi prajapati kii police muthbhed main maut ko sahi paaya lekin soharabuddin shaikh ke kathith encounter ko ansulajhaa hi chhod diya
 Citing no link being proved in both encounters, the entire story of the alleged plot was sidelined
 par ye nahin bataaya ki soharbuddin ko kisne maaraa or kausar bi kii maut kaise hui? alabatta teenon kii maut kaa dukh jarur jataayaa
 The question is, when death has occurred, someone is killed but in 13 years, even after CID, CBI investigation and court trial, it could not be revealed
 aakhir kyon?soharabuddin shaikh ke bhai rubabuddin shaikh kaa kahana he ki kanoon andhaa he suna tha lekin sibiai or jaj bhi andhe hai ye bhi dekh liya
 Rubabuddin belongs to the victim's family, so his resentment against the decision is natural
 lekin kanoon or kachhari kii thodi bhi jaankaree rakhane vaala shaks bhi adaalat ke is faisle ko pachaa nahin paa rahaa he
 Why this? Special CBI judge while giving his verdict on December 21, admitted that Soharbuddin died due to bullet but who could not prove that the bullet was killed
 jabaki 26 navambar 2005 kii subah soharabuddin ko maarane kaa daawa khud gujarat kii aties or rajasthan kii police ne kiya tha
 It was not just the claim that the then DSP ML Parmar had recovered the empty shell of all 8 bullets in front of the punches and sent them to the forensic lab and it was also proved in the forensic lab that 3 bullets were fired from one gun, another 2 from another gun, The remaining 2 and 1 were run by different guns
 ab chunki ye sabhi goliyaan police waalon ne khud apni - apni sarvice pistaul or revolver se chalaai thi isliye unke record se aasaani se ye sabit kiya ja saktaa tha ki wo unke paas us din thi yaa nahin? ye kiya gaya lekin 2 saal baad saal 2007 main
 The old record was not taken then
 nateeja police waalon ko mukarne kaa mauka mil gaya
 While the FSL investigation confirmed that all guns were fired and most importantly, the gunshot fired from Soharbuddin Sheikh's thigh was fired from the gun of Inspector NH Dabi, recovered as Article 27
 was
 or to or aaropee kramank -7 abdul rahamaan, aaropee kramank -8 himanshu singh ravat or aaropee kramank-9 shyaam singh charan kii rojnama main darj tha ki soharabuddin ko goli unhone maari
 This thing also came in the charge sheet
 duusari baat, upar baraamad sabhi artical naa to aspataal main baraamad kiye gaye the or naa hi shav ke paas se
 According to the information, all the articles ML Parmar showed in front of the punches in the ATS office, saying that the medical officer witness PW-74 had given the police inspector NH Dabi to the hospital
 isse maamle main lipapoti kii baat saaf jaahir hoti he
 Tulsi Prajapati was arrested from a rented house in Bhilwara
 aarope he ki tulsi prajapati ko bhi usee din bhilwara se pakadaa gaya jis din ahmedabad main soharbuddin kaa encounter hua tha
 Could it be a coincidence or part of the conspiracy as alleged in the charge sheet? This question has arisen because the date of Tulsi's arrest was deliberately shown on 29 / 11 / 2005 so that the conspiracy could not be proved by combining both the cases
 tulsi ko 26 / 11 / 2005 ko uthaaya to bhilwara se gaya lekin giraftaari hathipol police thane main dikhaai gai wo bhi 29 / 11 / 2005 kii raat main
 While the monthly report of Udaipur SP Dinesh MN says that on 29 / 11 / 2005 at 5 pm, he went to Ambamata police station and questioned the arrested accused for killing Hamid Lala there
 jabaki hathipol police thane main darj diary main aaropee ko laane kaa samay takreeban 10 raat likhaa gaya he
 Meaning Tulsiram was already held and detained
 ambamata police thane ke esechao ranvijay gavaah pi dablyu- 67 ne 164 ke tahat bayaan diya tha ki espi dinesh em en ne use kaha tha ki giraftaar baad main dikhaaenge
 However, during testimony in court, he turned back from his old statement
 itnaa hi nahin tulsi prajapati ahmedabad main patel bandhuon par goli chalaane kaa bhi aaropee tha
 Therefore, Tulsi Prajapati was also questioned by Ahmedabad ATS police officer charge sheet witness PW-227
 poochtacha kii us report main tulsi ne khud bataaya tha ki use bhilwara se 26 november 2005 ko hi pakadaa gaya tha
 This could have been an important evidence to prove the link in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Tulsi Prajapati case but surprisingly, the charge sheet witness PW-227 was not able to testify in the court
 isi tarah rajasthan police ke afasar sudhir joshi gavaah pi dablyu 159 ne jiskaa 164 ke tahat bayaan bhi hua tha ki aaropee nambar -7 matlab police inspector abdul rahamaan or espi dinesh em en ne phone par 26 november ko hi bataaya tha ki tulsi prajapati samir naam se bhilwara ke ek makaan main chupa he
 Only after that Tulsi was captured from Bhilwara on the same day
 lekin adaalat main gavaahi ke dauraan wo mukar gaya
 He told the last week of November month by not giving the date
 us samay sibiai ke senior peepibipi raju kaa ferj banataa tha ki wo uske 164 ke tahat die puraane bayaan uske saamne rakhte
 But he did not do this intentionally or he did not know it by mistake
 jaj ke mutabik, aaropee kramank - 7 abdul rahamaan apane discharge aplication main hi us din ahmedabad main hone se manaa kar chukaa he
 DVSP Sudhir Joshi of Rajasthan Police claims that he got a call from Police Inspector Abdul Rahman's phone that Tulsiram is hiding in a rented house in Bhilwara
 lekin naa to joshi or naa hi abdul rahamaan ke mobile phone kii jaanch kii gai
 Rehman's phone's CDR and data could have known his location but that too was not done
 udaipur ke es pi dinesh em en kaa driver puuranamal meena jo maamle main ahm gavaah tha wo mukar gaya
 People's book also mentions only the visit of SP Dinesh MN
 sab inspector himanshu or shyaam singh ke bare main bhi ye sabit nahi ho paaya ki donon vaardaat ke pehle yaa baad main maukey par the
 His mobile phone was not seized by the investigating agency and neither CD was found, from which his location could be found
 yahaan tak ke gujarat e tii es ke police afasaron kaa mobile lokation bhi nahin liya gaya
 ATS inspector NH Dabi, who is accused of shooting Sohrabuddin 2, could not be proved to be on the spot
 kyonki police ke driver bhi adaalat main mukar gaye
 He says that we did not take the office car there
 ham vahaan gayi hi nahin the
 It was confirmed that the bullet recovered from Sohrabuddin's thigh was confirmed by Dabi's revolver, it was proved in the FA L, but that revolver was with Dabi that day, it could not be proved from the record
 kathith banduukon ke ishu karne kaa bhi saboot bhi nahin mila
 Their records were also not submitted
 khaali kaartuson se banduukon ke milan se jude sawaal ke jawaab bhi nahin mil paae
 According to the judge, DYSPML Parmar, who identified Sohrabuddin's body in the hospital, could have been a key witness in the case but he was made an accused
 jaj kaa daawa he ki siaidi or sibiai donon bhi apni kahani sabit karne main fail rahe
 The evidence was not collected properly
 praathmik saboot bhi nahin mil paaya
 i am helpless According to the CBI story, Sohrabuddin Sheikh went from Indore to Hyderabad with his wife
 vahaan gujarat aties kii team gai
 Sohrabuddin Sheikh was on a bus from Hyderabad to Sangli with his wife Kausar Bi
 us bas main tulsiram prajapati bhi tha
 Just then, on 23 November, the police team, chasing from Hyderabad, stopped the bus and took down the three and took them into their custody
 tulsiram ko baad main chhod diya gaya lekin soharabuddin or kausar bi kii hatya kar di gai
 But according to Judge SJ Sharma, the entire case was investigated by three agencies
 par ek bhi agency soharabuddin shaikh or kausar bi ke indore se hyderabad jane kii baat sabit nahin kar pai
 It was said that he went by Maruti car but the car was not seized
 uskaa dost kalimuddin jisane soharabuddin ko hyderabad main dekhne kaa daawa kiya tha uskaa bayaan nahin liya gaya
 Tulsiram was claimed to be there but he was not even asked
 kalimuddin urf naimuddin kii bahan jise aapa naam se pukaarte the or jisane sibiai ko bataaya tha ki soharabuddin or kausar bi hyderabad aaye the usne bhi sibiai kii kahani ko saport nahin kiya
 The story of the entire journey is doubtful as there is no evidence of his stay in Hyderabad
 yahaan tak ki jis bas main gaye the
 The ticket for that bus was also booked in the names of some Salman and Sheikh Ahmad rather than Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi
 par wo koun the ye pataa nahin chalaa
 Surprisingly, neither the travel agent nor anyone else could identify the photos of both of them
 yatriyon main ek apte dampatti ne unki photo dekh jarur bas main hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 He was also deposed under 164, but both of the court turned hostile during the trial
 soharabuddin ke bhai rubaabudin ne ekbar kaha tha ki soharabuddin ne bataaya tha ki wo sangli bas se ja rahaa tha
 But when the investigation took place, that phone of Rubabuddin was not deposited
 varanaa usase kuch pataa chal saktaa tha
 It was told that Kausar Bi was from the stomach at that time

 The complainant in the case, Rubabuddin Sheikh, did not know that Tulsiram Prajapati was also with them
 rubabuddin ne bataaya tha ki tulsiram ne ujjain main ek paper sahi kar diya tha or use pachhtaawaa tha ki uski vajah se soharabuddin shaikh kii maut hui
 This thing also happened in the year 2006 but he told it in the year 2011

 How can the words heard in prison be considered true when the inmates of the jail have also turned their back on it? sibiai kii kahani he ki tulsiram hyderabad se bas main soharabuddin ke saath bas main tha, jabaki bhilwara main jis makaan se tulsiram ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha us makaan maalik chandankumar jha ne bataaya he ki 15 dinon se tulsi us makaan main tha

 But it is also a fact that Sohrabuddin Sheikh died and Kausar Bi is missing
 soharabuddin ke encounter kii exiaar darj he
 So someone is responsible for that

 The election was held under the dictatorial rule of General Hussein Mohammad Irshad
 isi tarah shaikh hasina ne bhi 1996 main us vakt chunaavon kaa bahishkaar kiya tha, jab khalida pradhanmantri thim
 When the Hasina government rejected Khaleda's demand that the 2014 elections be conducted under the care of a fair caretaker government, Khaleda boycotted the elections

 'sandesh saaf he ki saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ye teenon netaa ek saath chunavi dangal main najar aaenge or apane virodhiyon ko dhul chataa denge
 However, here the question arises that will the solidarity seen in this poster of Tridev really show on the ground? This question is justified here because in the poster Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi are seen together
 magar hakeekat yah he vartmaan main paanch rajyon main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaav main ye donon netaa ek-duusare ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai
 Not only this, Akhilesh Yadav has even gone on to accuse the Congress that because of that it could not form an alliance with Samajwadi Party in the assembly elections in five states

 In Bihar, the war of words between the ruling Janata Dal United and the BJP on the NRC issue is intensifying
 jabase assam main neshnal register aaf citigen kii suchi ai he tab se ek ore bijepi ke netaa bihar main bhi bangladeshi ghuspaithiyaan kii sankhya lakhon main bataate hai or yahaan bhi enarasi lagu karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 The entire controversy started as soon as the list of Assam came on the last Saturday, after that the National Vice President of Janata Dal United Prashant Kishore said that due to wrongly done NRC, today millions of people have become foreign in their own country and such complex subject Implementing without deliberate and that too only for political gains will surely result in wrong
 iske baad baari aresas se jude or ab rajyasabha saansad profesar rakesh sinha ne apane twitor handle par ek pole shuru kiya ki kya bihar ke simanchal main enarasi hona chahie
 He argues that infiltration is a kind of silent invasion that is clearly visible in some districts of Bihar, especially in Araria, Purnia, Katihar and Kishanganj, due to which the social environment and secular democracy has also weakened
 saafe tha ki bijepi ke netaa janata dal united ke netaaon se is mudde par ittefaaq nahin rakhte lekin agar jediu ke netaa agar kuch bolenge uskaa wo jawaab bhi denge
 But on Wednesday, Nitish cabinet ministers also jumped into the controversy and Vinod Singh, the backward or extremely backward welfare minister and BJP leader, said that there are about 40 lakh infiltrators in Bihar and they should be removed by applying NRC
 vinod singh jo khud katihaar zile se aate hai unhone kaha ki bangladeshi ghuspaithiya avaidh rup se aakar bas gaye hai or ye din-raat aparaadh main lage rahete hai
 It was the turn of the Janata Dal United to respond to this and Industries Minister Shyam Rajak said that there is no need of NRC in Bihar at all
 yahaan par koi ghuspaithiya nahin he
 When the spat between JDU and BJP intensified, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi took the responsibility of cooling the case and he blamed Congress party for this problem
 modi ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir or assam aise simavarti rajya hai, jahaan congress sarkaron kii laaparvaahee ke chalate kai dashakon tak padosi deshon se bade paimaane par ghuspaith jari rahane se in rajyon kii samskruti par bura asar padaa, sthaneey logon ko rojgaar ke maukey ganvaane pade or desh kii suraksha ko gambhir chunautiyaan milane lageen
 According to Modi, in 1979, the students of Assam mobilized a massive movement against the intruders and forced the central government to find a solution to the problem
 endie sarkaar supreme court ke aadesh par enarasi ko apadet karne main lagi he
 The NRC list has been prepared for the identification of intruders under the supervision of the Supreme Court, options have also been given at several levels to address the shortcomings
 durbhagyavash, jammu-kashmir main dhara-370 or assam main enarasi ke mudde par congress or argedy jaisi partiyaan raajnneetik swaarth se upar nahin uth paa rahi hai
 The central government sees large numbers of infiltrators as the root of many serious crimes such as separatism, terrorism, extremism and smuggling in different parts of the country, so working strictly to deal with the problem of infiltration without worrying about political profit and loss Has been jinke liye sabase pehle dal, parivaar, satta or sampatti he, ve enarasi ke mudde ko votbank ke najariy dekh rahe hai, lekin bhaajapa ke liye desh pehle he ham raajnneeti main 'nesan first' ke siddhant ko jite hai

 Only after this it will be known that which party won the election in 16 mayors, 198 municipality and 438 nagar panchayat and who suffered a crushing defeat
 isse pehle abeepi news-si voter ke agsit pole main soobe ke 16 main se 15 nagar nigamon main bijepi ko jabardast jeet milane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 According to this survey, the posts of mayors of 15 municipal corporations including Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Agra, Allahabad, Ayodhya and Kanpur are seen going to the bjp's account
 is agsit pole main ayodhya main bhi bijepi ko jeetta dikhaaya gaya he
 The BJP is said to get 48 percent of the votes here, while the Samajwadi Party got 32%, the BSP got 17% and the Congress got 2%
 yahaan se bhi bijepi kaa meyar bananaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 According to this exit poll, in Lucknow, BJP can win 40 percent, SP 27 percent, BSP 13 percent, Congress 18 percent and others one percent
 yahaan meyar pad par bijepi baaji maarthi najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, BJP is seen winning the post of Mayor in PM Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 yahaan par bijepi 45% vot ke saath sabase aage he
 Here Mridula Jaiswal is the candidate from BJP
 survey ke mutabik is seat par 21% espi ko, bispi ko 14%, congress ko 16% or anya ko 3% vot mil sakate hai
 According to the exit poll, the mayor is going to the bjp's account in the Gorakhpur Municipal Corporation elections of CM Yogi Adityanath's stronghold
 yahaan par bijepi ko 45 fisadi, bispi 11 fisadi, espi ko 22 fisadi, congress ko 10 fisadi or anya ko 11 fisadi vot mil rahe hai

 Apart from this, only BJP can be the Mayor of Agra
 yahaan bijepi ko 52 fisadi vot milane kii baat kahi ja rahi he, jabaki samaajawaadee party kaa vot pratishat girakar 12 rah gaya he
 The bsp's vote has increased and reached 27 percent, while the Congress is likely to get only 4 percent of the vote
 is agsit pole main bijepi ko badhat mili he

 After swine flu caused havoc in the country, now its medicine is also being stolen
 mumbai airport par is beemaari kii dawa 'temiflu' kii chori kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 It was sent from Delhi, the medicine was sent from Delhi, it was stolen from Air India aircraft
 'temiflu' ke 4 packet kisi ne uda liye
 Significantly, there is a lack of mask in many cities of the country to prevent swine flu or there are complaints about it being sold at a higher price
 dawa kii chori se ajeebogareeb sthiti paidaa hoti najar aa rahi he
 However, the theft case is being investigated
 pyaar or kariyar donon ek-duusare se bahut alag hai
 When a person is in love, he likes nothing more than the partner's happiness
 kai baar ye pyaar tabatak hi barkaraar rahata he jab tak usamen kamitment kii koi maang nahin hoti
 But as soon as there is talk of advancing the relationship of love, many times the passion of career comes forward
 aisa sirf ladakon ke saath nahin hota, is maamle main ladkiyaan bhi ab mukhar hoti ja rahi hai
 Recently, some of Bollywood's hottest and loving couple Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Singh have also come to the news
 khabaron ke mutabik deepika apane kariyar par zyada focus kar rahi hai or is vajah se vah ranbir ko koi bhi kamitment dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Something similar happened when Anushka Sharma did not ask Virat Kohli's wedding proposal for his career
 aisa sirf celebrati kapal ke bich main nahin ho rahaa he
 This thing is also seen in normal life
 jahaan ladkiyaan kariyar ke peak par shaadi or kamitment jaisi ahm modon se judana nahin chaah rahi hai
 Let us know why most relationships break up on the demand for commitment
 
 
 1
 Girls are beginning to consider their careers as more important than marriage and that is why they do not agree to commit to it early
 2
 Who does not love freedom? ek yah bhi vajah he kiindependent ladkiyatpani life main kisi or kii zyada dakhlandaji ko bardaasht nahin kar paati hai
 3
 ladakon kii life main shaadi ke baad koi khaas badlaav nahin aata lekin ladakiyon ke paas dheron jimmedaariyaan aa jaati hai
 Because of this too many girls avoid falling into early marriage and commitment
 4
 Earlier, where people thought of marrying according to the age of the girl
 vahiin aaj ke jamaane main umr bas number kaa khel samajha jaataa he
 Therefore, old age also does not prevent girls from fulfilling their dreams
 5
 Nowadays girls consider it more important to get their identity than to get married
 isliye jab aisi baat saamne aati he to vorishte ke pehle apane kariyarka chunaav karti hai

 After the defeat of the Congress in the Deputy Speaker election in Rajya Sabha, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are once again seen in a quarrel
 dilli congress adhyaksh ajay maakan ne aam aadmi party par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki raajnneetik phayda uthaane ke liye aap doharaa maapdand apanaati he
 Maken said that if the Congress did not support the Aam Aadmi Party in 2013, the BJP would form the government, and it would remain history
 Those in media supporting liberal views- will you wait for another Nitish or patnaik?aap says-‘politics not run on egos’yet AK is sulking because didn’t get a call from rg-thus helped BJP
 Using this logic-in 2013, BJP would have formed Govt in Delhi & AAP would have been history — Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken) August 9, 2018 Maken said Rahul Gandhi's call to Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh that politics does not work with Iago , Kejriwal is getting depressed because Rahul Gandhi did not call him
 The arrogance which has set in AAP with lone Delhi victory, is bringing them down
 Politics is not being clever, cunning & dubious-as you all are
 Its about long term perspective+commitment to the cause, which AAP does not have!that’s why aap’s few good ones have left them!— Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken)august 9, 2018makanne kaha ki media main ek report chal rahi he ki aam aadmi party kii yah soch thi ki rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke chunaav ke samarthan ke liye rahul gandhi kejariwal ko phone karenge
 He said that in the past the Aam Aadmi Party had supported the BJP in the Rajya Sabha on the issue of impeachment of the Chief Justice
 maakan ne loksabhaa chunaav kaa zikr karte hue yaad dilaayaa ki 2014 main bijepi ko jitaane ke liye aam aadmi party ne congress ke khilaaf ummidavaar utarkar bijepi ko jitayaa tha
 Maken said that the support of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi in 2013 was a bitter experience, with our support, the AAP party started lying to form the government
 hamaare netaaon par exiaar darj karwaai gai or 2014 main hamaare ummidavaaron ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar utaare or bijepi ko chunaav jitayaa

 In fact, in its first budget, the Modi government has decided to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector from the current 26 per cent to 49 per cent, while in the defense sector also FDI has been increased from 26 to 49 per cent
 mamata ne apane fasebuk pej par likhaa he, 'hamane is sarkaar ke satta main aane se pehle majboot or jeevant bharat ke bare main suna tha
 We thought that it would provide good governance

 The only positive sign of the new government in the two budgets is that it is the government for FDI, by FDI and for FDI
 ' unhone kaha he, 'khudara main epadiai pehle se hi he
 FDI is now being reduced to 49 per cent in the defense and insurance sectors
 iske alaava banking kshetra main 49 fisadi vinievesh kiya jayega
 All these will have an adverse effect on the people of the country
 'mamata ne kaha he ki 'beti bachaao, beti padhaao' yojana ke liye maatr 100 karod rupee kaa aavanton majaak ke sivaa or kuch nahin he
 He has raised the question, 'kanyashree' scheme in our state was started for the first time with a provision of Rs 1000 crore

 Mamta has also criticized not giving West Bengal a stake in the six new textile clusters with an allocation of Rs 200 crore
 unhone kaha he, 'pashchim bengal main textile kshetra kii aseem sambhaavna hone ke baavjood use chah nae cluster main jagah nahin di gai he
 The Trinamool Congress chief has said, "despite West Bengal being the largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the country, the horticultural university announced in the budget did not come in its share, it is sad
 'mukhyamantri ne kaha he, 'yahaan tak ki garibon ke liye chalane vaali 100 din rojgaar yojana ke liye ek bhi paisa nahin badhaayaa gaya he
 On the other hand, along with petrol, diesel and kerosene, the prices of fruits and vegetables are increasing daily
 ' unhone kaha he ki nai sarkaar 'raajnneetik vair saadhane' kii raah par agrasar he
 Its intention is not good, probably because there is no vision in its budget

 a 20-day SDRF course is currently being conducted by the Uttarakhand government at the disaster management site in Amritpur, Haldwani, in which around 25 SDRF personnel are undergoing training
 rajya main kedarnath aapadaa ke baad se is aapadaa se nipatane ke liye esadiaref kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 After taking basic training from NDRF, now the personnel of SDRF are being given training according to the geographical location of Uttarakhand so that they can do rescue work in the fierce firefight in addition to disaster and also teach the villagers throughout the year

 According to Deepak, who is teaching training tricks, anywhere, after reaching the disaster-prone areas in the shortest time of the disaster, the affected people have to be brought to the right place after delivering first aid to the hospital
 unke mutabik koshish ye he ki ek vyakti 20 logon ko aapadaa se nipatane kii training de or wo 20 aage 20 logon ko pramot kare taaki puure uttarakhand main ek bachche se lekar bujurg takaapadaase nipatane kii jaankaree sabko ho
 According to Deepak, the plan to open this training to the general public by the month of January is being finalized so that the general public can also prepare to deal with the disaster, as well as options to attract tourists to Haldwani and nearby areas
 She is making
 yahaan par training le rahe javaanon ko aapadaa ke samay logon ko bachaane ke liye pahaado se neeche utarana or chadhana padataa he or marij yaa ghayal ko bhi baandhakar upar tak laana padataa he, lihaaza unako nadi ko paar karke bhi logon ko bachaane kii training di ja rahi he
 According to the jawan, who is taking training, he has done basic course of 45 days and now has come here to do another 20-day rescue and search course
 unke mutabik yahaan bahut si nai baaten seekhney ko mili hai jaise river crossing or mountain climbing, jo aane vaale dinon main un ilaakon main laabhakaari hoga jahaan aapadaa ke samay unki tainaati hogi
 However, the SDRF team, which is getting ready to deal with the disaster in Uttarakhand, will do the relief and rescue work at the time of the disaster, as well as to teach the villagers the disaster in the disaster affected areas as part of the public awareness campaign so that the victims at the time of the disaster To get immediate relief through the villagers
 kai gadhwali or punjabi filmon kaa nirdesan karne vaale diarector naresh khanna kaa nidhan ho gaya he
 Get to know about the personality of this great director by speaking of a artist
 maine janmatithi dekhne ke liye unka fasebuk dekha to paaya ki unki timeline par Friend Request Sent sho kar rahaa he
 The entire scene of Sunday wandered before my eyes
 11 baje ke lagbhag jab rakesh goud ji ne neelam chowk ajarunda metro stesan se naresh khanna ji ko apni car main baithaaya
 I, Brijmohan Sharma, Sonu Bhai were already present in the car
 ye meri naresh khanna ji se pehali or aakhri mulaakaat thi
 After the meeting, i sent a friend request after coming home
 kal dilli se dehradun jate hue train main unhen heart atake aayaa
 He was brought directly to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, but he died then
 unka parivaar mumbai main he isliye vimaan se unke parthiv sharir ko mumbai le jaaya gaya
 He directed several Punjabi films including 'bantwaru', 'chakrachal' and 'subero Gham' and 'bhuli Ai Bhuli' in Garhwali
 'chakrachaal' unki hit or charchit film thi
 Nowadays he was involved in the promotion of the recent release Garhwali film 'bhuli Ai Bhuli'
 ravivaar (7 agast) ko film 'bhuli i bhuli' faridabad neelam theatre main pradarshit ho rahi thi
 The first show was so that many people of Garhwal Sabha Faridabad were engaged in receiving Naresh Khannaji
 neelam cinema main hamane saath baithkar film dekhi
 In the epilogue i told him, Sir, you hit the mining mafia in the film well
 akhbaar or channelon kii khabaron se to sarkaar ke kaanon main jun nahin rengti lekin aapaki film janajagran kaa kaary karegi
 Then there was a brief discussion on the condition of cinema houses and the direction of Uttarakhandi film industry
 pehali hi choti-si mulaakaat main maine paaya ki ye vyakti vaisaa katai nahin he jaisaa main soch rahaa tha
 Last year, casting of 'bhuli Ai Bhuli' was taking place at Surbhi Studios in Delhi
 mere ek dost ne mujhe bataaya ki aap bhi naresh khanna ji se milakar aao unhen gadhwali kalakaaron kii aavashyaktaa he
 i thought if he is such a big director, i do not know what to think and came from Mumbai
 to ye sochakar bhi main nahin gaya
 Today i was proving to be a liar and regretting myself
 kaash main usadin surabhi studio gaya hota to aaj film 'bhuli i bhuli' kaa hissaa hota
 They got quite dissolved in the first meeting
 unhone mujhe kisi film main dekha tha aage saath kaam karne kaa bharosa bhi dilaayaa
 But what i knew was that they would break their trust on their own
 ye pehali mulaakaat aakhri mulaakaat sabit hogi or hameshaa ke liye dil main ek kasak chhod jaayegi
 Arvind Kejriwal has lost his mental stability
 yah kahana he bhartiya janata party (BJP) kii dilli ikai ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari kaa
 Manoj Tiwari's statement came when he was asked that Arvind Kejriwal has said that if the NRC is implemented in Delhi, you will go first
 is baat par apni pratikriya main manoj tiwari ne kaha, "main poochna chaahunga ki, jo shaks purvanchal se aata he, vah gaiyrkanoonee ghuspaithiya he, jise vah dilli se khaded dena chaahate hai
 
 
 "manoj Tiwari said," Those who have settled in Delhi from other states, you are considering them as foreigners
 
 
 ? aap unhen dilli se khadedakar baahar kar dena chaahate hai, to aap bhi unheen main se ek hai
 
 
 If this is his intention, i think, he has lost his mental stability
 
 
 kisi IRS adhikari ko yah kaise nahin pataa ki NRC kya he
 
 
 ? ”earlier Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced an important scheme for the people living in Delhi
 mukhyamantri jab apane press conference se baahar jane lage to us samay unase mediakarmi ne enarasi ko lekar sawaal kiya jiske jawaab main arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki agar dilli main enarasi lagu hua to sabase pehle manoj tiwari jaaenge
 Let me tell you, Tiwari has demanded on several occasions in the past that NRC should be implemented in Delhi like Assam
 pichley maheene tiwari ne kaha tha ki bangladeshi or rohingya sahit avaidh pravaasiyon kii badi sankhya main maujuudagi ke chalate dilli main sthiti ‘ khatarnaak ' ho gai he kyonki in logon ko aapraadhik gatividhiyon main sanlipt paaya gaya he
 Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has targeted the National Election Commission over tampering of evms in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh
 kejariwal ne iviem ke software se judaa data saarvajanik karne kii maang karte hue kaha he ki agar chunaav ayog ke paas data dicode karne kii takanic uplabdh nahin he to aam aadmi party ke export 72 ghante main aisa kar sakate hai
 During a press conference on Monday, Kejriwal said, 'an EVM has come out in Madhya Pradesh, where BJP is getting votes on pressing any button
 ye bhi sunne main aayaa he ki us mashin samet kul 300 mashine uttar pradesh ke kanpur ke govindnagar se madhya pradesh ke upachunaav ke liye mangai gayi hai
 What was special about these machines, which broke the rules and laws, these special evms have been sent to Madhya Pradesh? The Aam Aadmi Party demands from the Election Commission that such machines be investigated and the truth be laid before the public
 'chunaav ayog par kejariwal ke aropaniyamon kaa hawala dete hue kejariwal ne chunaav ayog ko hi sawaalon ke ghere main khadaa kar diya

 Reservation Against Cancellation Quota
 agle maheene se ye faisla lagu ho saktaa he
 The down side berths in all express, Shatabdi, Rajdhani, Duronto and Premium trains will be fully reserved for RAC
 railway ke adhikariyon kaa aisa karne ke peeche tark ye he ki maujuuda vyavastha main tikaton kii baari maang he or aise main jin logon ko kahin janaa he wo baithkar jane ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, more seats will be available for the passengers during the festival season
 railway ke aalaa afasaron ke mutabik said kii berth puri tarah searesikarne se railway ko ek saal main takreeban 1500 karod rupee kaa phayda ho paaegaa
 This will allow more passengers to travel on the one hand, while on the other side, the deficit of the railway, which is facing losses, will be reduced to some extent
 lekin yatri suvidha ke lihaaj se is faisle ko bahut acha nahin kaha ja saktaa he kyonki aap paisa puri berth kaa denge lekin safar baithkar karenge
 According to the current proposal of the proposal, the existing 4 RAC seats in AC-3 coaches in express trains will be increased to 8
 asi-2 kii dibbe main maujuuda 3 aarasi siton ko badhaakar 6 kar diya jayega
 Talking about AC-1, the existing 2 RAC seats will be increased to 4
 in sabhi aarasi siton par safar kar rahe yatriyon ko kisi tikat cancellation ke badale conform berth bhi milti rahegi
 While these losses also claim to increase passenger facilities on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, it is constantly taking such decisions, which makes the journey of railways difficult rather than pleasant
 aarasi kota doguna karne par puraa paisa dene ke baavjood logon ko baithkar hi jane ko milegaa
 The special thing is that after this system is in place, it will happen that if your ticket is not confirmed, then the expectation of getting confirmed will be reduced
 saath hi, aap paise to puri seat ke denge, lekin aapako milegi aadhi seat jis par aap letkar nahin balki baithkar safar puraa karenge
 Obviously, this proposal of the Ministry is not very good for railway passengers
 ye bhi he ek makasadakhaas baat ye he ki apni kamai badhaane ke liye railway tamaam alokapriy faisle lene kii manshaa bana chukaa he
 Railways are in loss of about 4,000 crores till now and in this way new new ways are being found to increase earnings
 kamai badhaane kii kavayad main hi sitambar maheene main flixi fere system lagu karke rajdhani, shatabdi or duranton ke kiraye dhed gune kar die gaye
 Simultaneously, the Railway Senior Citizen is also considering ending the subsidy
 1500 karod kaa hoga phaaydis prastaav ke peeche railway kii manshaa aamadani badhaane kii he
 At present, the railways are incurring a loss of about Rs
 4 thousand crores in respect of passenger fares
 rail mantri suresh prabhu kuch samay se lagaataar aise kadam uthaa rahe hai jisase railway kii kamai bade
 Whether it is the Flexi Fair system or the matter of ending subsidies to senior citizens
 anumaan ke mutabik is faisle ko lagu karne se uske khajaane main 1500 karod rupye kii badhotaree hogi
 All these decisions may improve the economic condition of the railways, but the benefits are less losses to the railway passengers

 Hodge had accused Kohli of not playing in the Dharamshala Test so that he could fit in the IPL and play
 kohli ko dharmashala se pehle ranchi test main chot lagi thi or vah ranchi main ballebaaji karne utre the
 Prior to the Dharamshala Test, Kohli said that he was not 100 per cent fit and therefore would not play in the match
 viraat ke dharmashala test main na khalane ko lekar uthaaye the sawalhoj ne ise kohli kii ipiel main khilne kii kharaab niyat bataaya tha
 He had said that Kohli withdrew from such an important series so that he could play in the IPL
 unhone aage kaha tha ki ipiel main khilaadi khub paise kamaate hai, isliye kohli ne aisa kiya hoga
 Hodge had said that other players had also done this before Kohli

 The controversy had grown so much over Hodge's statement that his team in IPL Gujarat could have suffered the same, perhaps seeing this all Hodge has now apologized

 He is producing a film with me but is not directing my film
 aap karan johar, aditya chopra se puch sakate hai
 On working with the new directors, Akshay said - Director of the film Good News, Raj Mehta is my 21st new director
 mujhe ye bhi lagata he ki acha kaam karne kaa unka laalach puraane nirdeshkon se kahin adhik he
 Because for them, it is a do or die situation, because they think they will end if the film does not work

 9 march ko satara main 150 kilo mefedrone drug ke saath pakade gaye police hawaldaar dharmraj kalokhe ko mumbai police is ummid se lekar ai he ki wo uske aakaaon tak panhuch sake
 But Kalokhe himself has raised the name of a Mumbai IPS officer in the case and sent the Mumbai Police on the back foot
 aaropee kalokhe ne adaalat ko ek patr likhakar bataaya he ki satara police usase mumbai ke ek ipies ke bare main baar-baar poochtacha kar rahi thi
 Kalokhe's lawyer Naveen Chaumal said while talking to Media outside the court that it is possible that the Mumbai police has brought a fake case against him to save his elder officers
 jabaki satara main pehle se ek maamla darj he or mumbai police kii jaanch usee kaa hissaa he
 Dharmaraj Kalokhe was actually a soldier of the Marine Drive Police in Mumbai
 wo thana incharge se ye kahkar satara main apane gaanv gaya tha ki uske pita kaa dehanth ho gaya he
 But his real motive was to sell 150 kg of MD drug to Goa
 par uske pehle hi satara police ko uski bhanak lag gai or 9 march ko unhone kalokhe ko drug ke saath giraftaar kar liya
 In the inquiry, it was found that the drug was kept hidden in his locker in the Marine Drive police station
 mumbai police ne satara police kaa intjaar kiye bina hi loker khol kar talaashi lee to usamen 12 kilo drug baraamad hua
 Therefore, Mumbai Police has registered a separate case and started investigation
 mumbai main emdi kii sabase badi saudagar jis shashikala patankar urf baby ke saath aaropee hawaldaar kaa naam joda ja rahaa he wo abhi tak naa to satara police or naa hi mumbai police ke hathe chadh pai he
 It is learned that his entire family is in a drunken business
 dharmraj kalokhe ke pakade jane kii soochna milte hi wo mumbai chhod surat bhaag gai thi
 Returned from there to Borivali in Mumbai
 lekin uske baad kahaan gaayab ho gai ye kisi ko nahin pataa
 It is said that Baby implores the police and other government officials in their lovemaking first and then cleanly involves them in his black business
 isliye drug taskari ke is raikat main ek custom adhikari kaa naam bhi aa rahaa he
 Surprisingly, the accused himself is raising the question that how can an adorable soldier run such a huge racket without the help of big officers
 lekin wo khud aaropee hokar apane aakaaon kaa naam nahin bataa rahaa he
 MD means mephedrone drug, also known as meow-meow
 haal hi main andipies kanoon ke tahat pratimbandhit kiye is drug ne mumbai main bade paimaane par yuvakon ko jakad rakhaa he
 The case has become even more complicated with the arrest of a havildar of the Mumbai Police and the name of the Customs and IPS officer
 bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha he ki janata kaa mood congress ke khilaaf to he hi, bijepi se bhi uskaa mohabhang hua he
 Advani indirectly criticized former party president Nitin Gadkari, saying the attitude of BJP in the case of then Karnataka Chief Minister YS Yeddyurappa surrounded by allegations of corruption was wrong
 endie ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ne kaha ki pichley kuch saalon se main yah dekh kar vyathit hum ki janata kaa mood vartmaan sattarudh sarkaar ke khilaaf hone ke saath hi bijepi ke prati bhi mohabhang vaala he
 Advani, who is expecting 'zero tolerance' (no tolerance at all) from the BJP against corruption, said in an interview to 'the Week' that the way we dealt with the Karnataka case has really disappointed me
 is bare main unhone spasht kuch nahin kaha, lekin lagata he vah bhrashtachar kaa saamana kar rahe yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad se hataae jane main kaaphi samay tak taal matol kiye jane se naaraaz hai
 In the context of the three-day BJP gathering held here last week, he said that he had become very emotional and was deeply saddened by the public disenchantment with his party
 saath hi unhone kaha ki vah bhaajapa ke bhavishya ko lekar ashanvit hai

 Politics has intensified due to the destruction of Uttarakhand
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri par aarope lagaaya he ki narendra modi sirf prachaar karne main aage hai or kaam karne main peeche
 In fact, there were reports in the media that Modi reached Dehradun with his special 'rescue team' on Friday and in two days, he rescued 15,000 Gujarati devotees from there
 digvijay singh ne nishaanaa sadhate hue twit kiya ki modi kii kisi tarah kii pahal se pehle hi log bachaae ja chuke the par modi iskaa shrey khud le rahe hai
 Speaking at the scathing attack, the Congress general secretary said that 'fenku' got involved in its work

 VIP people should let the administration do its work

 Significantly, the politics of Uttarakhand tragedy started at the same time when Modi reached Dehradun

 When Congress President Sonia Gandhi told the media after the Assembly election results on March 6 that 'we must not forget that we have been successful in a state,' then she was politically correct, but wrong in terms of mathematics
 She was congress manipur main jiti thi, haalanki sonia kaa ishaara uttarakhand kii taraf tha
 It was prudent to take precautions
 isse bhi kharaab baat yah hui ki jis uttarakhand main congress bhaajapa se sirf 1 seat zyada jeet saki he, chah din ke bheetar vahaan party main baghawat ho gai
 The Congress was three points behind the halfway mark with 32 mlas
 is sankhya kii vyavastha chaar nirdaleey vidhayakon kii madad se puri kii gai
 On March 9, Congress submitted a claim to form the government
 ab samay tha mukhyamantri ke chayan kaa
 Things started getting uncontrolled from here
 baarah march kii shaam ko sonia ne rajya se saansad chune gaye 65 varsh ke vijay bahuguna ko agle mukhyamantri ke taur par chunaa
 Another MP from the state and supporters of 64-year-old Harish Rawat, a Maharathi of Uttarakhand Congress, immediately rebelled
 agle din, jab bahuguna dehradun main shapath le rahe the, to 18 vidhayak dilli aa gaye or unhone nagaade bajaate, bigul phunkate hue ravat ke ghar kii lon main deraa daal diya
 Only 11 Congress mlas were present at the swearing-in ceremony
 gusse main tamtamaate or behad rahasypurna dhang se upamaayen dete ravat ne patrakaron se kaha, 'main congress kii balika vadhoo hum, mujhe nyaay chahie
 'his supporters made the point clear
 almoda ke saansad pradeep tamata ne kaha ki ravat party ke star prachaarak the, iske baavjood unase kanishtha netaa ko mukhyamantri kii kursi de di gai
 The party high command's decision has so far been challenged by public displays of power
 november 2010 main jab ashok chahvan kii jagah prithviraj chahvan ko maharashtra kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya to vilasarav deshmukh bhi naakhush the, lekin unhone naaraazgi saarvajanik taur par jaahir nahin kii thi
 a rumor has started against Team Rahul in Uttar Pradesh
 is paraajay ke liye party kaaryakarta uttar pradesh ke prabharee mahasachiv digvijay singh, congress kaarysmiti ke sadsy mohan prakaash, pradesh congress adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi or rahul ke sachiv kanishka singh ko doshi maan rahe hai
 Supporters of Amita Singh, the party candidate from Amethi, hold Rahul's closest workers responsible for her defeat
 congress kaarysmiti ke sadsy aar
 K
 dhawan kehete hai ki sari jimmedaari rahul ke salaahkaaron kii he
 On March 7, Sonia told the media that the 'wrong distribution of tickets' was responsible for the defeat in Uttar Pradesh
 congress kii kendriya chunaav samiti (siisi) ke ek sadsy ke anusaar, ummidavaaron kaa faisla rahul ke karyaalay ne kiya tha, or baithak hone ke pehle hi isaki pratiyaan siisi ke baaki sadasyon ko baant di gai thim
 Copies of some in the selectors' documents are with India Today
 unase do baaten saaf taur par ubharkar aati hai
 One is that caste was an important aspect in selecting candidates
 doosraa yah ki duusari partiyon se aane waalon ko congress ke logon se zyada tarjeeh di gai thi
 See the case of Bhogaon seat in Mainpuri
 yahaan se brajeshsingh yadav ko tikat diya gaya, jo chah saal pehle congress main shaamil hue the
 According to Rahul's team notes, Yadav was the best candidate, as' he will be the only Yadav from this seat
 ve ghosi yadav hai
 The Congress is sure to benefit from 38,000 Yadav votes by fielding one Yadav
 ' tees saal se party ke sadsy prakaash pradhan kaa daawa thukraa diya gaya
 According to a note prepared by Rahul's office for the CEC, "though he has been active in this field and may be a good candidate, the caste equations are not consistent with him
 ' is seat se yadav paanchaven sthaan par aae
 Alauddin Khan was given ticket from Bethari Chainpur seat for being Muslim only
 apane note main congress ke chayankarta kehete hai, 'haalanki ve bahut lokapriy nahin hai, lekin acha pradarshan kar sakate hai, kyonki is seat par 65,000-70,000 muslim voter hai or sapa-basapa, donon ne obisi ummidavaar khadey kiye hai
 'to believe that an unpopular candidate can win only because of his religion is gross politics
 khan saatven sthaan par rahe
 Some favorites were promoted
 eta ke kasganj se said sherwani ko tikat diya gaya, jo sapa ke purv netaa saleem sherwani ke bhai hai
 Sherwani came in fourth place
 isi prakaar, firozabad kii sisraganj seat ke liye siisi kaa note kahata he, 'sapa ke sanghathan ke aadmi rahe harishankar yadav haal hi main congress main shaamil hue hai
 He has been recommended by Raj Babbar
 ' harishankar paanchaven sthaan par aae
 According to a member of the CEC, 'we were given ready notes
 vaise bhi, hamamen se koi bhi rahul kii pasand se asahmat hona nahin chahta tha
 'it is also a telling story in itself that when Rahul met the media on March 6, he was completely alone
 iske agle din jab sonia media se milin, to ahamed patel, janardan dvivedi or motilal vora sahit party ke diggajon kii ek puri tukdi peeche maujuud thi
 Rahul needs to take his party with him first before reaching the rest of India

 itnaa hi nahin, unhone pakistan kii pole kholte hue kai bade mudde bhi duniya ke saamne rakhaa
 With this, Pakistan raised 5 big questions, which can be difficult to answer
 bharat ne pakistan kii pole kholte hue kaha ki pakistan ko itihaas nahin bhoolanaa chahie or yaad rakhana chahie ki 1971 main unhone apane logon ke saath kya kiya tha
 First of all, the news from UN General Assembly, the world's largest platform, where in response to Pakistan's war threats and hate speeches, India has used 'right to Reply' Pakistan needs to look into its poverty 
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kaa bhaashan sachai se pare he
 India has bluntly said that Pakistan should not advise India on human rights

 vaajapeyi kaa daawa he ki vishwa aitihaasik viraasat tajmahal prachin tejo mahalay mandir kaa hissaa he
 Vajpayee says that the Mughal ruler Shahjahan had bought some of the temple land from Raja Jai singh
 unka kaa daawa he ki isse sambandhit dastavej abhi bhi maujuud hai
 He alleged that Azam Khan, senior minister of the UP government sitting on the Waqf properties, is now eyeing the World Heritage building Taj Mahal
 unhone kaha, 'tajmahal main paanch vakt kii namaaj padhane kaa ajam kaa sapana kabhi nahin puraa ho paaegaa
 Waqf Minister Azam said at the conference of Mutawallis on November 13 that he would ask the state Sunni Central Waqf Board to make Taj Mahal the property of the board and appoint him as Mutawalli
 haalanki jab is bayaan par samvaadadaataaon ne ajam se sawaal kiya to vah palat gaye or kaha, 'aap log majaak ko gambhirtha se kyon le lete ho?'iske baad agra ke ek sanghathan 'imam e raja' ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or grahamantri rajnath singh se maang kii ki tajmahal ko vakf kii sampatti ghoshit karen or moharram ke dauraan vahaan matam kii ijaajat den
 However, the Shia's leading religious leaders rejected the demand for the Taj to be considered the property of the Shia Waqf Board, stating that world heritage buildings should be kept out of such disputes
