 The committee believes that aviation safety was not given as much attention and importance as it should

 The committee has noted the lack of security equipment at some airports and said that the issue of installation of CCTV cameras and error in security equipment should be taken priority so that such flaws do not become a cause of concern for the Indian airport security system

 He was amazing in these conditions, maybe the conditions here were more suited to the bat than the ball

 But when he landed he did not give any of us a chance and he blew away our bowling
 ’morgan se jab gail ko rokane kii yojana ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ‘gail ko rokane ke liye kaaphi yojanaayen thim
 Certainly we bowled him a short ball for a while

 He is a batsman who is difficult to bowl
 vah kuch ‘dot’ gend kheltaa he lekin saath hi usamen mahaj ek hi over main kisi bhi gendbaaj ko raundne kii kshamta he
 His skill level was very high in this match

 At different times in the world, there have been many bloodthirsty and bloodthirsty dictators, whose stories of persecution make the story creep
 koi taanashaah akele chah lakh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar detaa he, to koi taanashaah apane hi logon par jahrili gas chhod detaa he
 Someone just blows the front with a cannon on opening his mouth, or he removes all the clothes from his body and leaves the hungry dogs to eat
 duniya main taanaashaahon or taanaashaahee kaa ek lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 But these five of them are dictators, in front of their oppression, the story of all the oppressions of the world seems to be small
 ye wo paanch taanashaah hai, jinke haath lakhon logon ke khun se sane hai
 1
 kim jong:uttar korea kaa taanashaah hukmraanatin saal main saikadon logon ko top se uda dene or faansee par chadha dene kaa ilzaam2
 Idi Amin: Former Uganda dictator dictator accused of killing 6 lakh people 3
 karnal gaddafi:libya kaa purv taanashahajaron logon ko maut ke ghat utaar dene kaa iljaam4
 Saddam Hussein: Former President of Iraq accused of killing thousands of people 5
 husnee mubarak:mishra kaa purv taanashahsaikadon logon ko maut ke ghat utaarne kaa ilzaam
 Meet all these dictators before their dreadful tale, which has added the newest page to the centuries old story of dictatorship
 ye he duniya kaa sabase nayaa taanashaah, naam kim jong he
 North Korea is its sultanate
 ye achaanak surkhiyon main isliye aayaa he, kyonki isane pichley maheene apane hi raksha mantri ko sirf isliye top se uda diya, kyonki wo ek meeting ke dauraan so gaye the
 In this, his own uncle was stripped naked and thrown in front of a hundred hungry dogs because he became a threat to its chair
 iske mulk main agar koi videshi tivi channel, videshi filmein yaa videshi gaanaa sune to use gaye faansee par chadha detaa he or uske ghar ko aag ke hawaale kar detaa he
 In this country, ordinary people cannot walk by car
 ye haq sirf mantri or raksha mantralay ke afasaron ko he
 In this country, its hair style is considered the fashion of everyone's hair
 khabaron ke mutabik uttar korea ke sena pramukh hyon yong jol ne sena kii ek meeting main halki si jhapai le lee thi
 It was for this reason that 66-year-old Heyan was flown with an anti-aircraft gun at a military training range on April 30 in the presence of hundreds of people
 hyaan ko maut kii sajaa unki giraftaar ke teen din baad di gai
 Wonderful from above, Kim blew his last rites with full state honors after blowing his body into pieces
 vaise uttar korea ke tanashaah kim jong kii haivaaniyat kaa ye pehla maamla nahin he
 Kim Jong is accused of killing 70 senior leaders and officers, including his own uncle and aunt, by poisoning or blowing up with a cannon
 kehete hai ki usne apni garlphend tak ko naaraaz hone ke baad goliyon se bhunwa diya tha
 Kim is scared of the hairdresser, so she never got her hair cut by the hairdresser till date
 wo apane bal khud katata he or uske elaan ke baad se hi uske baalo kaa style hi north korea main baalo kaa fishan mana jaataa he
 Kim has completely banned Western media, Western civilization and sports in his country
 kim ko apane dada kii tarah dikhne kaa jabardast shauk he
 It is said that he has undergone several cosmetic operations of his face and body, in want of his grandfather's appearance
 isiilie wo apane vajan bhi kam nahin karata
 Kim has a great passion for horse riding
 lekin shart yahi he ki jis vakt wo ghudsawaari kare, koi or ghudsawaari karata na dikhaai de, varna wo usko goli se marava detaa he
 Idi amina name of a Tanashah that many people do not consider as human
 isiilie wo apane naam se zyada aadamkhor raashtrapati ke naam se janaa gaya
 This man-eater wrote the story of his life on the cheat paper with blood ink and then became the President of Uganda
 lekin uskaa asli cheharaa abhi tak duniya ne nahin dekha tha
 That face was that of a man-eater
 is aadamkhor ke naam chah lakh logon ko maut ke ghat utaarne kaa iljaam he
 This is the story of a President, who will be shaken even by the greatest courage
 ek aise aadamkhor raashtrapatiki kahani hagaddi par baith kar insaanon ke maance seapani bhukh mitaatha tha
 But the biggest question is how a human flesh eater finally became the President of a country
 darasal aadamkhor idi amin ke raashtrapati banane kii kahani jitani dilachasp he utani hi khooni bhi he
 This is the story of becoming the President of a country from an army chef
 darasal uganda kii sena main idi amin ek adana sa khansama hua karata tha
 But he had a very clever and ferocious mind
 lekin uski tarakkee kii pehali seedhi bana uskaa rakshas jaisaa sharir
 Idi Amin's height was 6 feet 4 inches and his weight was 160 kg
 sena kii naukari ke dauraan usne boxing ko apana kariyar banaaya auravo puure nau saal tak lagaataar uganda kaa neshnal champion rahaa or isi kii badaulat usesena main tarakkee milti rahi
 By 1965, Idi Amin became a general in the army of Uganda
 lekin uskinazarauganda kii gaddi par thi
 During that time, the Prime Minister of Uganda relied heavily on Milton Obote Amin
 lekin ek din amin ne is bharose ko chakanachur kar diya
 Prime Minister Obote was in Singapore and the Idi Amin coup here in the capital Kampala
 25 janvari 1971, mahaz teen ghante main puure desh kii bandor idi amin ke haath main aa gai
 Idi Amin ruled Uganda for a full 8 years
 or in 8 saalon main shaayad hi aisi koi subah rahi ho jab uganda kii sadakon par saikadon laashen naa mili hon
 It is claimed that during his rule, Idi Amin killed the entire 6 lakh people
 yahi nahin satta ke nashe main chur idi amin kii nazar jis kisi aurat par pad jaati thi wo use har haal main hasil karke hi maanata tha
 She had done not one or two marriages and had 45 children
 karnal muammar al gaddaphiaadamkhor idi amin ke julm jitani tezi se bad rahe the utani hi tezi se taiyaar ho rahe the uske dushman
 But Idi Amin had full faith in his friends and among them Amin's greatest friend was Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Al Gaddafi
 gaddaphi kii takat par idi amin ko itnaa bharosa tha ki usne padosi mulk tanzania se dushmani molle lee
 On 30 October 1978, the army of Idi Amin attacked Tanzania
 amin kii madad ke liye karnal gaddaphi ne libya kii sena bhi bhej di
 Amin's army and Gaddafi's army together fought with Tanzania for a full 6 months
 lekin aakhir main tanzania kii fouj dhaddhadati hui uganda kii rajdhani kampala main daakhil ho gai or10 april 1979 koidi amin kii julm kii hukumat kii khatm ho gai
 And with this, dictator Idi Amin left Uganda forever and ran away
 idi amin sabase pehle apane dost karnal gaddaphi ke desh libya gaya or vahaan se pahunch gaya saudi arab
 Idi Amin lived in the Arab city of Jeddah for the next 24 years and died on 20 July 2003
 do dashak tak wo iraq kaa betaj badshaah bana rahaa
 He even threatened Amorika
 par is tanshah ne bhi bas ek galati kii
 The people he ruled did not spare him
 ghar ke andar diwaar par tangi is taanashaah kii tasviir tak zaraa si tedi ho jaati to ye uski jaan le letaa
 The result of such indifference with his own people was that when he was hanged in his own country at the last moment, there was no one to save him
 saddaam hussainhathon main pistaul thame hawa main goliyaan chalata saddaam
 In the second picture, Saddam Hussein is smoking cigarettes from Befikri
 yetasviren us daur kii kahani bayaan kar rahi hai jab iraqmen saddaam hossain kii marji ke khilaaf ek patta bhi nahin hilta tha
 Now this picture has changed
 iraq kii rajdhani baghdad auravhaan ke ek chauraahey parasaream girtaa saddaam kaa but usee taanashaah ke patan kii kahani banyaa kar rahaa he
 This story is about a dictator who inflicted so much persecution on the people of his country for his stubbornness that even humanity had wept
 ye kahaneus taanashaah kii he jisane apane hi mulk or apane hi awam ko nestanabood kar diya
 The story of Saddam Hussein's oppression is as frightening as his journey to become president
 do dashakon tak iraq ke raashtrapati rahe saddaam hossain kaa janmsaal 1937 main baghdad ke uttar main sthit tikrit ke ek gaanv main hua tha
 In 1957, a twenty-year-old Saddam joined the Baath Party
 1962 main iraq main vidroh hua or brigadier abdul kareem qaasim ne britain ke samarthan se chal rahi rajshahi ko hataakar satta apane qabze main kar lee
 But there was a revolt against his government but it failed
 saddaam hossain bhi is baghawat main shaamil the or pakade jane kaa dar se saddaam bhaag kar misr main ja kar chhip gaye
 Again in 1968, there was a rebellion in Iraq and this time 31-year-old Saddam Hussein, along with General Ahmed Hasan Al Bakr, took power
 vakt ke saath-sathsaddaam hossain ne satta par apni pakad majboot kar kii or apane rishtedaaron tathaa sahyogiyon ko sarkaar ke mahatvapurn padon par niyukt karte chale gaye
 As soon as he took power, he started beating his rivals
 isi dauraanan 1982 main saddaam hossain ne apane upar hue ek aatmghaatee hamale ke baadadugel gaanv main 148 logon kii hatya karvaa di thi
 In August 1990, Iraq waged a war with Kuwait, accusing Kuwait of bringing down oil prices
 janvari 1991 main ilmerica fouz ke dabaav ke dakhal ke baad iraqi sena ko kuwait se peeche hatane ke liemajaboor hona padaa
 Thousands of Iraqi soldiers were killed and captured in this war
 lekin is shikast ke badasaddam ko iraq main shiya samudaay kevidroh kaa saamana padaa
 And by the year 2000, George Bush's coronation in America increased the pressure on the Saddam government
 iske baad america safataur par iraq main satta parivartan kii baat kehane laga
 In 2002, a UN team visited Iraq and tried to find a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons there, but found no success in this
 baavjood iske march 2003 main america ne apanemitra deshon ke saath iraq par hamalaa kar diya
 And finally Saddam Hussein's government was toppled on 9 April 2003 after a forty-day war
 iske baad 13 disambar, 2003 ko saddaam hossain ko tikrit ke ek ghar main andar bane bunker se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 After this, Saddam was tried in many cases
 aakhirkaar5 november 2006 ko saddaam hossain komaut kii sazaa suna di gai auruttari baghdad ke khademia ilaake kecamp justise main faansee de di gai
 With this, the existence of another dictator from the world disappeared forever

 Nair, former Secretary of the Department of Space and former Chairman of the Space Commission, said that the orbiter is working in normal orbit of the Moon
 vahiin chandrayan-2 ke chandramaa kii sataha par safaltaapurvak utarane sahit kai anya uddeshy the
 When Chandrayaan-2 (chandrayaan 2) lander 'vikram' lost contact with the ground station while landing on the moon, Nair told pti-bhasha on Saturday, "I think we don't need to worry too much
" 
 
 main kahuunga ki mishan ke 95 pratishat se adhik uddeshy puure hue hai
 "he said," The arbiter has reached space and must do the mapping work well
 '' kareeb ek dashak pehle chandrayan-1 mishan ko safaltaapurvak puraa karne ke baad chandrayan-2 mishan shuru kiya gaya, jisamen ek orbitor, lander (vikram) or rover (pragyan) shaamil tha
 Nair, however, said that it was very disappointing to lose contact with the lander and he never imagined it
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah ham sabhi ke liye niraashajanak he
 The whole country expected this
 ''purv isro pramukh ne kaha, ‘‘jab 2
 The distance was 1 km, the expedition was very complicated at that time

 Who does not like to sleep and if he sleeps in the morning then it becomes difficult to leave the bed
 aisa ham sabhi ke saath hota he
 We plan to get up early in the morning every day and that plan fails by night
 kabhi ham apni koi pasandida film dekhne lag jate hai to kabhi fasebuk chating main hi der raat tak jage rahete hai
 The result is that sleep opens late in the morning and all our next plans fail
 aise main ham aapako kuch aasaan upaay suza rahe hai, jinhen apana kar aap har roj subah ke suraj ke darshan kar sakenge
 
 
 1
 sone ke liye shedul bana lenek aam insaan ke liye 7 se 9 ghante kineend jarurihe
 If you go to sleep around 11 pm doing all the work, then understand all the problems ahead
 2
 Avoid the snooze button The snooze button in the alarm clock saves you just 5 minutes and you don't get any special benefit from them
 to aage se aap is sahaj or najdiki aakarshan se bachane kii koshish karen
 3
 brakefast pehle hi bana lenaisa kai baar hota he ki behtareen naashte kaakarshanapako subah uthne ke liye baadhya karata he
 The health benefit that comes from having breakfast in the morning is there
 4
 Keep the alarm clock at some distance from the bed
 This trick works many times
 aap khud ko alarm ghadi se dur rakhen or isi chakkar main aapako bistar se uthanaa pad jayega
 5
 sone se 45 minute pehle phone or laptop tyaag denyah ek aajamaayi hui tarkeeb he
 Avoid any kind of screen-light 45 minutes before bedtime
 isse raat ko neend samay par aegi or subah time par khulegi bhi
 6
 subah kamare main roshni ke aane kii vyavastha rakhenaisa aksar hota he ki ham apane kamare ko chaaron taraf se pack rakhte hai
 It is not that a ray of light comes from anywhere, but such things work to keep us away from nature
 aage se aisi koshish karen ki kamare main kahin-na-kahin se thodi roshni aae or vah baaki kaa kaam khud-ba-khud kar degi
 7
 puraane jamaane kii alarm ghadi kaa istemaal karempurani cheez hameshaa kharaab hi nahin hoti
 Now take the case of the old-fashioned alarm clock
 awwal to uski aawaaj or duja use band karne ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali trick
 8
 sone se 6 ghante pehle kisi caffeine vaale padaarth kaa istemaal na karenaisa kai adhyayanon ke madhyam se saamne aa chukaa he ki sone se pehle caffeine kaa seven hamaari neend ko maar detaa he
 So leave the intention of drinking coffee and tea before bedtime
 9
 Take the edge with smoking
 Now there is hardly any dissatisfaction with the fact that smoking makes us sleep suddenly
 ham chaah kar bhi thodi der ke liye so nahin pate
 10
 apane kamare main lavendar kii khooshbu kaa istemaal karenho saktaa he ki is baat ko pard kar aap muskura rahe honge lekin lavendar kii mahak aapako shantipurvak sone main madad karti he
 It has been proved through many research that sprinkling of lavender in your bed and room gives you better sleep and you will be able to wake up only after a good sleep
 11
 Always try for this, you have to try daily to sleep early in the night and wake up early in the morning
 aisa nahin ho saktaa ki aap ek din thaan lenge or agle din se subah uthne lagenge
 For this, try to gently mold the body
 shuruyaat main iji torget set karen or us par hi khare utarane kii koshish karen

 The Nehru Memorial has been preserved by the government in commemorating the ideology of the Congress-free Kianeharu at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library located at Teen Murti Bhawan in Delhi and the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country
 yahaan pandit nehru ke raajnneetik jivan, vichaardhaara se judi smritiyaan hai
 The Union Ministry of Culture has freed the Congress of Nehru Memorial Society and replaced people associated with the BJP and right wing ideology
 aise main congress ke saath-saath nehruvaadiyon kii chintaa he ki vaicharik rup se virodh karne vaale log nehru kii viraasat ko kaise sambhalakar rakh paaenge?1930 main hua teen murti bhawan kaa nirmaannehru memorial kii purv nideshak mridula mukherjee ne kaha ki teen murti bhawan kaa nirmaan 1929-30 main hua tha or yahaan kii librari main mordan india ke itihaas se jude dastavejon kaa khajaana rakhaa gaya tha
 After the independence of the country, Tirumurti Bhawan was the residence of Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister for a full 16 years and he remained here till his last time
 1964 main nehru ke nidhan ke baad tatkaaleen sarkaar ne ise nehru memorial sangrahalay or librari main badal diya
 'keep national heritage away from political animosity', Mukherjee said that in this memorial, memories related to Nehru, his life and objects related to India's freedom movement have been stored
 yahaan jawaharlal nehru or unke jivan or kaaryon se sambandhit kagajaton va anya aitihaasik dastavejon ko arjeet kar sangrakshit va parirakshit karne kaa kaam kiya jaataa he
 He said that intellectuals and research scholars from all over the world come here to know and understand the Indian independence movement, modern India and the legacy of Nehru
 desh kii ek badi or anmol dharohar he, jise raajnneetik dwesh se alag rakhaa janaa chahie
 The government wanted to bring its own people: Let us know that in the last few years, BJP has been constantly questioning Nehru and his legacy on different issues, but also an attacker
 vahiin, ab nehru memorial se congress netaaon ko baahar kar diya gaya he, jiske chalate siyasat garmane lagi he
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has expressed displeasure over the decision, saying, 'it is unfortunate that the government is taking every decision from a political point of view
 ye faisla sirf isliye liya gaya kyonki ve panel main apane logon ko chaahate the
 Violent tampering with the legacy of the freedom movement: Manoj Jha, a member of the rjd's Ra jya Sabha and DU professor, Manoj Kumar Jha, says that the change in the Nehru Memorial is what i consider to be a violent molestation
 ye log nehru ke mizaaj ko hi nahin samajhate hai
 He tried to tarnish Nehru's image for six years and he does not even understand history
 aise main wo kaise nehru kii viraasat ko sanbhaalenge
 He says that i consider the change in Nehru Memorial to be a petty and dwarf act
 is memoryal main sirf nehru hi nahin balki aazaadee ke andolan ke dauraan khato-khitaabat, document, monograph, chinh, news paper or tamaam itihaas se jude tathy upasthit hai
 In such a situation, i find it impossible to complete one's phd without going there
 congress kii viraasat nahin he nehru memorial: bal mukund pandikhil bhartiya itihaas sankalan yojana ke rashtriya sanghathan mantri dow
 Bal Mukund Pandey said that Nehru Memorial Congress has no legacy
 nehru desh ke pehle pradhanmantrithe, unke naam par memorial hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki unke vanshaj yaa phir unke hi vichaardhaara ke log hi vahaan kabiz rahen
 Here Nehru is opposed not as a person but as an ideology and contemplation
 aadmi to bas praani he or buddhi kaam kar rahi he to muddon par virodh hota he or saport hota he
 The Nehru Memorial is being built as a PM gallery, where people will get a chance to read and understand all the Prime Ministers
 aise main iskaa virodh kiya janaa uchit nahin he
 Senior Government Arvind Mohan says that 'the government is doing all the institutions like Gujarat', now that after putting the people close to the constitutional institutions of the country, the government is now eyeing all the institutions like Nehru Memorial
 inhone gujarat main bhi aisa hi kiya he, jiskaa nateeja he ki pichley 20 saal main gujarat se koi research paper desh yaa duniya main prakashit nahin hua he
 The country now wants to do the same
 vah kehete hai ki nehru memorial dilli main padhane-likhane ke liye nae kism kaa centre sthapit kiya gaya he
 We have been going here since 1980
 lekin ise ab raajnneetik shikaar banaaya ja rahaa he
 Although it was first to be built for the Prime Ministers of the country, it was named after Nehru
 itnaa hi nahin ise nehru se zyada congresikaran kiya gaya
 Nevertheless, we will say that the members who were created to some extent at that time had a level, but the existing members who have come have no connection with academics
 aise main wo kya karenge, kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa he
 'an attempt to make Nehru irrelevant' Senior journalist Rashid Kidwai says that since the Modi government came to power, it has been an attempt to make Jawaharlal Nehru irrelevant in the country
 yahi vajah he ki nehru memorial main nehru kii vichaardhaara vaale logon ko baahar kar aise logon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jo bijepi ke nazariye se desh or nehru ko dekhte hai
 We feel that through this they will work to tarnish Nehru's image by exposing his shortcomings
 vahiin, lakhanu vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneetik professor dow
 Dilip Agnihotri says the change in the Nehru Memorial should not be seen as ideological opposition
 hamaare lihaaj se unhen mauka diya gaya he to unke kaam ko dekha jaae or uske baad hi koi tippanee kii jaani chahie
 For those who contribute in the country, work should be done above the political ideology and party
 congress agar unka bachaav nahin kar pai he or agar koi karnaa chahta he to use mauka milanaa chahie
 In the history of ODI cricket, only four double centuries have been made and there are four Indian players
 rohit sharma kii pratibha bataane ke liye itnaa kaaphi he ki isamen se do dohare shatak unheen ke naam hai
 In odis, Rohit proved his ability on many occasions, but he still remains to prove himself in Tests
 rohit ne ab tak sirf 7 test khele hai, jisamen unke naam 489 ran he
 This includes two centuries and a half-century
 rohit ne apana pehla vanade 2007 main khelaa, lekin test main debyue karne ke liye unhen kareeb 6 saal intjaar karnaa padaa or westeindies ke khilaaf unhen kolkata test main khilne kaa mauka diya gaya
 In the debut test against West Indies, he scored a brilliant century and made everyone crazy
 dakshin africa daure par rohit ko test team main rakhaa gaya, lekin apane pehle videshi daure par vah puri tarah naakaam rahe
 On the bouncy wickets of South Africa, bowlers like Dale Steyn and Morney Morkel troubled Rohit a lot
 khaskar del sten ne rohit ko ran banane ke kam maukey die
 As a result, Rohit, who scored a century in his first two Tests, was able to score just 45 runs in the two Tests played on the ground
 newjiland daura rohit ke liye thodaa behatar rahaa
 Here he scored 122 runs in four innings of two Tests, including a stunning 72 in the first innings of the Auckland Test
 england daure par team india ke bade−bade ballebaaz flop ho rahe the or rohit bhi usee qatari main shaamil hue, haalanki unhen sirf ek test khilne kaa mauka mila, jo team india ke saath−saath rohit ke liye bhi bhula dene vaala rahaa
 Here England defeated India by a big margin of 266 runs
 ab australian daure par rohit ke saamne badi chunauti he
 Where a large army of fast bowlers along with Mitchell Johnson is ready to test him
 agar yahaan rohit australia kii tej pich par ran banane main safal hue to test cricket main bhi vah apni pahchaan banane main safal ho jaaenge, lekin yahaan naakaami unhen test cricket se dur kar sakati he
 The success of the Iraqi Sunni terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and al-sham (ISIS) is shocking
 2003 main iraq main al-kaayda ke rup main shuruyaat karne vaale gut ne hafte bhar se bhi kam samay main iraq ke ek-tihaai hisse par kabja karke america ko bhi hairaan kar diya
 There, now underestimating the capacity of ISIS has become a major political issue
 lekin al-kaayda to america ko ek dashak se jhansa detaa rahaa he kyonki rajnatik hastkshep se khufia vyavastha taar-taar ho jaati he
 In the game of destruction of Iraq, only Iran will win
 2003 main america or british hamale se pehle desh main al-kaayda kaa namonishaan nahin tha
 There was only Ahmed Fadil al-khalayilah alias Abu Musab al-zarqawi, who was the founder of the organization which is now being called ISIS
 al-jarakavi jordan kaa ek chota-motaa sargana tha, jo 2001 main hamale kii taiyaari ke liye afghanistan se aayaa tha
 He began preparations for his organization in 2002 by recruiting Sunni militants
 tab se america ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati jorge bush ne ladaai se pehle hi hamale kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 This allowed al-zarqawi to spread traps and recruit recruits to attack after the war
 iske baad al-jarakavi ne baghdad main sanyukt raashtra mukhyalay ko udaaya or videshiyon ko vahaan se bhaagane ke liye baadhya kiya
 After the removal of the Americans and British residents, al-zarqawi pushed the country into civil war
 syria kii tabaahi se faltaa-phulataa iageyesbush or unke sahyogi jaanate the ki al-jarakavi yuddh se pehle iraq main maujuud tha, lekin ve yah nahin samaj paa rahe the ki vah vahaan kya kar rahaa tha
 The then Foreign Minister Colleen Powell, in her famous speech to the UN Security Council, mentioned al-zarqawi dozens of times, saying that her presence indicated that Saddam Hussein and al-qaeda had links
 yah bada jhooth tha
 The US intelligence knew that Iraq had nothing to do with the 9 / 11 attacks and Osama bin Laden
 asal main osama bin laden to 9 / 11 hamale se pehle hi al-jarakavi kii jordan kii prishthbhumi ko lekar sashankit tha or usase hameshaa haath bhar kii duuri banaae rakhata tha
 Bin Laden expelled him from western Afghanistan for some time in 2000 because he was suspicious of his loyalty
 iske alaava shiya samudaay ke prati khoonkhaar hinsa bhi laden ko pasand nahin thi
 But after the Iraq war began, bin Laden began to value his ability
 2006 main bush al-jarakavi ke shaitani samrajya ko khatm kar dena chaahate the
 al-zarqawi and his first successor were killed, but the Sunni militants became more militant after disbanding the faction and gaining the loyalty of the Sunni tribes
 acha prashasan hi al-kaayda ko khatm kar saktaa tha, lekin saddaam ke baad iraq main vah sambhav nahin ho paaya
 Neither with myself nor with the help of America
 iraq kii raajnneeti varg-samudaay ke bhed se upar nahin uth saki
 Nor could they quit fighting among themselves
 unhen is baat kii parvaah nahin thi ki america unase kya apeksha kar rahaa he or kya chahta he
 But the US was confident that Iraq's al-qaeda was a defeated organization and the attack was a success
 syria kii ladaai iageies ke liye ek tohfa sabit hui
 At first he formed al-nusra as his agent in Iraq
 al-nusra ko al-jarakavi ke purv sahaayak mohammad al golani ke netritv main ek swatantra party ke rup main pesh kiya ja saktaa tha
 The ISIS then demanded that Nusra should confess that her loyalty would remain to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi rather than Ayman al-zawahiri, bin Laden's successor
 vidambnaa yah ki al-jawahiri ne bin laden ko bahut pehle hi uske bhavishya ke prati cheta diya tha
 In his last days when bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan, he used to tell al-zawahiri that he had the right opinion about the Jordanian terrorist and his Iraqi group
 lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 al-baghdadi, another pseudonym, is an ambitious man
 vah apane bare main rahasy banaae rakhane main safal rahaa he
 al-zarqawi keeps away from the fame behind which was crazy
 vah al-kaayda ke puraane netritv ko bhi khaarij karata he kyonki vah saamudayik nafrat bhadakaane kaa icchhuk nahin he
 His supporters want to campaign for worldwide jihad to make al-baghdadi the real successor of bin Laden
 iraq ke duusare shahar mosul par kabja karne se pehle iageies ne iraq ke ambara or syria ke rakka praant par kabja kar liya tha
 There he applies radical Islam in the Taliban style
 mosul par kabja badi uplabdhi rahi kyonki pracheen shahar hone ke kaaran iskaa pratikatmak asar he
 ISIS looted more than $ 400 billion from Mosul's banks and became the richest terrorist group in the world
 iageies kargar tareeke se arab duniya ke bichobich syrian registan main apni pakad majboot kar rahaa he or osmania samrajya ke patan ke baad ek sadi pehle britain or france kii banaai simaaen mitaa rahaa he
 Like al-zarqawi, al-baghdadi is also ambitious
 pichley maheene saudi arab ne hamale kii iageies kii yojana ko naakaam kar diya tha
 ISIS has recruited thousands of foreign fighters to fight in Syria
 sambhawatah iageies ne francisi musalamaanon ko prashikshit kiya tha
 They attacked the Jewish Museum of Brussels in May, killing four people
 iageies ke naatakeey hamale se jitna hairaan iraq tha, utani hi baaki duniya bhi
 After the attack the Iraqi army had to withdraw from Mosul and Tikrit and Sunni militants reached the Baghdad border
 iran kii khufia agenciyon ne bhi iageies kii takat ko kam karke aanka tha
 But Iran has the upper hand in Iraq, geographically, historically and by population
 aakhir kareeb 65 pratishat shiya aabaadi jo he
 Also, being a neighbor, Iran can easily send its advisors, experts and troops to Baghdad or other cities of Iraq and that too without any fragrance
 khabar he ki iran ke revolutionari gadrs ke commander kasim sulemani baghdad pahunch chuke hai
 This confirms how quickly Tehran takes action and how closely Maliki is connected with the government
 asar badhaane kaa aitihaasik avasartehran iraq ke 65 pratishat shiyaon ko ugravadiyon se ladgaye ke liye uksaa rahaa he
 This is a historic opportunity for Iran to expand its domination over the largest Arab Shia population in the world
 iran kii ministry of intelegence and security (emoies)main duusare number ke mantri kaa kahana he, “islamic republic of iran ek sher kii tarah he, jiske saath iageies aatankwaadi khilwaad nahin kar sakate
 The fate of Iran in Syria will be the same in Iraq
 ”iran ke log iraq main iageies or al-kaayda kii majbootee ke liye 2003 main america or britain ke hamale ko doshi tehraate hai, jabaki vidambnaa yah he ki jorge bush ke hamale se sabase bada phayda iran ko hi hua he
 The war brought an end to Iran's arch-enemy Saddam Hussein, who imposed the iran-iraq War on the Islamic Republic for eight years
 iraq kii kshetreey akhandta or ise ek desh ke rup banaae rakhane ke liye iran jabaani jamaa kharch hi karegaa kyonki shiya, kurd or sunni main banta iraq ek majboot desh kii tulana main iran ke liye adhik phydemand hoga
 Although the Shias have a heavy upper hand, they will depend on Tehran
 tehran america kii tarah madad ke badale shiyaon or iraq ke duusare samudaayon ke saath satta main hissedari kii maang nahin rakh rahaa
 Tehran needs strong Shia, not democracy
 beshak al-bagdadi ne iran ke hiton ke liye iraq par hamalaa nahin bolaa tha
 But like the community violence of his mentor Abu Musab al-zarqawi a decade ago, it will ultimately benefit Iran
 is bich iraq kaa yah kshetra sampradayik nafrat kii aag main jal rahaa he, jise bhadakaana behad aasaan he lekin rokna asambhav

 com / tsibkasmve Rashtriya Swayamsevak chief Mohan Bhagwat has given a big statement on the Ram temple, after which the politics has also intensified
 mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki ram janmabhumi par hi mandir banegaa, mandir ke alaava vahaan kuch nahin banegaa
 Mohan Bhagwat also questioned the arbitration of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on this issue
 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke is bayaan par muslim sanghathanon ne kadaa aitraaj jaahir kiya he
 At the same time, this statement has been challenged by the Supreme Court
 ol india muslim personal lau board ke pravaktaa moulana khalid safulla rahamaani ne news agency ko bataaya, 'board adaalat par yakeen rakhata he or uske faisle ke mutabik amal kii koshish karegaa
 Bhagwat has taken the law into his own hands by making this statement
 'sarkaar kare karravaryodhya vivaad main muslim paksh kii rahanumai kar rahe board ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki board kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar ko aise logon ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie jo khuleam adaalat kii tauheen karke kanoon ko apane haath main le rahe hai
 He said that it would not be acceptable for us to unilaterally say that Bhagwat said that a temple will be built at the disputed site
 babari ection cameti ne bataaya SC ko chunautibabari masjid ection cameti ke sanyojak jafarayab jilani ne bhi bhagwat ke bayaan par kadi pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha ki unhone supreme court ko chunauti di he, ki vah chaahe jo faisla de, magar mandir vahiin banegaa
 Jilani said, 'the Supreme Court is the supreme court in the Constitution and its order has to be enforced throughout the country
 usne vivaadit sthal par philhal yathasthiti banaae rakhane ko kaha he, vah sthiti kab tak bani rahegi yah pataa pataa nahin, lekin bhagwat ne bayaan dekar sidhe taur par supreme court ko chunauti di he
 Jilani termed it a threat to democracy and said that he feels that Bhagwat has made such a statement to benefit BJP in Gujarat assembly elections
 shiya personal lau board bhi bayaan ke khilaafaul india shiya personal lau board ke pravaktaa moulana yasuub abbaas ne kaha ki sangh pramukh supreme court se badhkar nahin hai
 The decision that the court will give in the Ayodhya case will have to be accepted by Bhagwat

 What did Bhagwat say? On Friday, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said in the Dharma Sansad held in Udupi, Karnataka that only temples will be built at the disputed site and nothing else
 ram mandir vahiin banegaa or is bare main kisi ko koi shaq nahin hona chahie
 He said that a grand temple will be built in Ayodhya as it was in the past
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki shri shri kaa is vivaad se koi lenaa dena nahin he

 But in this meeting there was a discussion between the Sangh and BJP leaders on the Ram temple to NRC issue

 At the same time, the Sangh will also conduct a nationwide campaign to accept the Ayodhya verdict to its cadre

 ' saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ne pichley 7 dinon se jari apana anshan guuruuvaar shaam ko khatm kar diya he
 Ending the fast, Anna said that the government has accepted their demands
 vahiin, anna ne dhamkee di ki agar sarkaar 6 maheene main in maangon par karrwai nahin karti he to ve phir bhukh hadtaal karenge
 Anna and her people are calling it their victory, though if they compare this movement of Anna to Delhi and Mumbai in 2011, it proved to be quite dull
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki majaburi main to anna ne andolan khatm nahin kiya
 Know the reasons that are pointing to this: The announcement has been made to increase the MSP in the budget
 The demands of the central government, which Anna has asked to agree to, are the demands of the central government itself
 anna ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ne unki yah maang maan lee ki krishi upaj kii laagat ke aadhaar par dedh guna zyada daam (MSP) mili
 Let us tell you that while presenting his fourth budget as Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley had announced that his party's manifesto in the 2014 Lok Sabha election manifesto promised to give farmers a minimum support price (MSP) of one and a half times their cost
 Are doing
 aise main sarkaar dwaara yah maang maan lenaa kahana, ek tarah se chhalaava hi he
 Government has been giving assurance on Lokpal for 4 yearsanna said that the Center has also assured that it will take a decision on the appointment of Lokpal soon
 aapako bataa den ki 2014 main chune jane ke baad se hi modi sarkarlokapal kii niyuktiko lekar aashwaasan de rahi he
 At the same time, recently the central government has held a meeting of the selection committee on March 1 for the appointment of Lokpal
 lokapal kii sellection cameti main piem modi, loksabhaa kii spikar sumitra mahajan, desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh mallikarjun khadge shaamil hai
 Anna said that the government has accepted their demands that the section be removed that the Lokpal cannot investigate the Prime Minister, MP, MLA and Cabinet Minister
 anna ke anusaar sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ne kaha he ki is bare main loksabhaa main sanshodhan kaa prastaav aayega
 The government did not pay any attention during the Anna movement of 2011 when the then UPA government was constantly talking to the committee of Anna and his movement
 us samay lagaataar centre sarkaar kaa prayaas tha ki anna andolan tod den
 Many UPA ministers were constantly talking to Anna and keeping an eye on the movement
 saath hi upie sarkaar ko anna kii kai maangon ke saamne jhukna bhi padaa tha
 However, this time there was no such view
 piemo kii ore se anna ke andolan ko khatm karne ko lekar kuch prayaas jarur hue, lekin koi bhi mantri yaa netaa anna ke is andolan par na pahunchaa or na hi koi bayaan detaa dikhaai diya
 CM Devendra Fadnavis of his home state Maharashtra and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat also reached to end Anna's movement
 vipaksh kaa nahin mila saathis samay modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh centre ke saath saath kai rajyon main bhi purajor tareeke se virodh kar rahaa he
 Opposition remains an attacker in Parliament on issues like Rafael Deal, Andhra Special Package, Cauvery issues, Kisan agitation, SSC paper leak
 haalanki vipaksh anna kii maangon or na hi uske andolan se khud jod rahaa he
 No leader came to share the stage with Anna
 yahaan tak ki centre sarkaar ke viruddh morcha banane main jutin pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee dilli pahunchin to unhone bhi anna ke andolan main pahunchane kii koshish nahin kii
 While Anna had voiced support for Mamta in 2014
 2011 ke andolan se sikh lete hue anna hajaare ne is baar pehle hi saaf kar diya tha ki jo ki unke saath is andolan kaa hissaa banenge wo kabhi raajnneeti main nahin jaaenge
 This is the reason why political celebrities have not been seen on Anna's stage till now
 hardik patel ne bhi andolan ko samarthan to diya, lekin anna se milane nahin pahunche
 People did not even see the support of Anna's movement as far away from the movement as it was in 2011
 2011 main anna andolan se kai sanstha or lakhon log jude the
 Along with Delhi, people in other parts of the country also supported this movement by taking hunger strike
 haalanki is baar najaara ulta tha
 Anna did not succeed in filling her tent
 vahiin anna jin kisaanon kii maangon ko bhi shaamil kar yah andolan kar rahe the, unke hikai sanghathanon ne is andolan se duribanaai thi
 If this was not the case, then the farmers who were taking notice of the entire country by taking a padyatra in Maharashtra, would not have reached Delhi for the movement of the Janata of their own Maharashtra
 logon kii is andolan main bhagidaari nahin hone se bhi anna ko is andolan kii haisiyat samaj main aa gai
 Last time, on social media, Anna's movement got a lot of support, but this time his movement was being made fun of
 anna ne ise lekar apana dard bhi jaahir kiya tha
 What about these promises? Starting the Anna movement, it demanded that farmers above 60 years of age dependent on agriculture get a pension of Rs
 5000 per month
 krishi mulya ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja tathaa sampoorn swaittata mili
 Nothing was said on this
 vahiin, anna ne to saaf maang kii thi ki lokapal vidheyak paarit ho or lokapal kanoon turant lagu kiya jaae
 a competent Lokayukta should be appointed in every state
 haalanki bas aashwaasan par unhone andolan khatm kar diya

 french neshnal railway yani esensief ne dilli or chandigarh ke bich hai speed coridor banane ko lekar apni antim survey report railway ko saunp di he
 According to the exclusive information received by Aaj Tak, the French Railways has said that to run a train at a speed of 220 km per hour between Delhi and Chandigarh, the Railways will have to spend an additional amount of Rs 12068 crore on the railway track
 agar railway aisa karti he to is rail line par dilli or chandigarh ke bich 18 jodi shatabdi gaadiyaan chalaayin ja sakengi or is root par 2019 tak badi sankhya main malgadiyaan daudai ja sakengi
 36 Shatabdi trains will be able to run The French National Railway has put forward three options for making Delhi Chandigarh high-speed zone
 pehle vikalp main 220 kilometre prati ghante kii spid par train daudane ke liye jaruri trek banane ke liye maujuuda trek main 12068 karod rupee kaa atirikt kharchaa aane kaa aankalan kiya gaya he
 After doing this, it is suggested to run 18 pairs i
e
 36 Shatabdi trains between Delhi and Chandigarh
 220 kilometre kii spid par train daudane ke liye puure trek par signling puri tarah se automatic kerani padegi
 There will be a complete overhaul of the power supply line
 iske alaava railway steshnon ko atyaadhunik bananaa padegaa
 delhi-chandigarh Railway Corridor will have to be fully fenced
 aisa karne ke baad dilli or chandigarh ke bich kaa safar 77 se 78 minute ke bich puraa ho sakegaa
 French Railways has suggested running high-speed trains
 aisa kaha gaya he ki pehle ingine or dibbe baahar se mangaaye ja sakate hai or uske baad yaheen par mek in india ke tahat is tarah kii gadiyon ko banaaya ja saktaa he
 French National Railway has said that if the railway wants to fit the rail corridors of Delhi and Chandigarh at a speed of 180 km per hour, then it will have to spend an amount of Rs 7020 crore
 180 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar ke liye trek ko feet karne baad semi-hispid coridor banegaa
 In this way, the distance between Delhi and Chandigarh can be completed in just 86 to 87 minutes
 agar aisa kiya jaataa he to dilli or chandigarh ke bich 18 jodi shatabdi trainen donon taraf se chalaai ja sakegeen or malgadiyon kii awajahi main pachaas fisadi kaa ijapha sambhavit he
 According to Fencing French Railways, the Indian engine can pull the train and technology can be brought from outside countries to make coaches for semi-high speed
 signling or bijli kii supplai ko atyaadhunik karnaa hoga
 Fencing on both sides of the railway line between Delhi and Chandigarh will be necessary
 french railway ne bhartiya railway ko teesraa opshan diya he ki dilli or chandigarh ke bich 160 kilometre ke liye trek ko feet kiya jaae
 In such a situation it would cost only Rs 4680 crore
 dilli or chandigarh ke bich main aisi sthiti main 15 jodi shatabdi gaadiyaan donon taraf se chalaai ja sakengi
 To do this the track will have to be repaired and all level crossings have to be completely eliminated
 signling or bijli supplai main bhi badlaav karnaa padegaa
 The Railway Ministry will soon take a decision on this final report of French Railways
 dilli hai court parisar ke baahar hue dhamaakon main ammonium nitrate or PETN kaa istemaal hua tha
 The use of shrapnel in the explosive was negligible
 lekin, abhi ye saaf nahin he ki dhamaakaa remote se kiya gaya yaa phir timer se
 At a glance modus operandi

 It was a quarter past ten in the morning

 Delhi Blast: People saw the heard eyes
 People standing outside the counter adjacent to Gate number five of Hallahicourt were getting built near them when there was a loud blast
 ajtak ko harakat-ul-jehadi ne bheja emaildhamaakaa rishepshan counter ke baahar rakhe brifces main hua tha
 The explosion was so fast that the cars parked nearby flew away
 dhamaake ke baad jameen par ek feet gaharaa or do feet chaudaa gaddha ban gaya
 In view of the pit, the investigating agencies suspect that at least two kg of explosives were used in the blast
 dhamaake ke liye ammonium nitrate or PETN kaa istemaal hua
 Let us tell you that PETN is a powerful explosive
 sirf sau gram PETN ek car ke parakhche uda sakati he
 The BJP and the Left parties condemned the blast, and usually use sharpenels or spikes in terrorist explosives to do more harm
 lekin, dilli hoicourt ke baahar hue dhamaakon main keelon kaa nahin ke baraabar istemaal nahin hua tha
 So most of the people were harmed by the explosions
 inamen bhi adhikansh log qamar ke neeche ghaatak chot ke shikaar hue
 NIA Home Minister Chidambaram will investigate Delhi bombings, 'most of the lower body has been affected
 blast se unke pair jakhmi hue hai
 a patient's leg had to be amputated
 ek-do or cese aise ho sakate hai
 i am heartbroken
 ’jaanch agenciyaan abhi is baat kii tafteesh kar rahi hai ki visphot ke liye timer kaa istemaal kiya gaya yaa phir remote kaa
 But experts believe that the timer may have been used
 isaki tasdik chashmadid ke bayaan se bhi hoti he
 The angry family members raised slogans against Rahul, according to the statement of Chashmidid, the suspect was there at the time of the blast
 agar uske paas remote hota to dhamaake kii jagah se wo hat chukaa hota
 This means that the explosive must have a timer and did not have a chance to escape
 rojaanaa 5,000 log jate hai dilli ucch nyaayalayis bich, police DL9CA 6034 number vaali ek car kii talash kar rahi he, jo hundai sentro yaa hundai ai-10 ho sakati he

 The Congress has played bets to increase the pressure on the Modi government over MJ Akbar, the Union Minister of State for External Affairs, who was under the 'me Too' campaign
 kuch maheene pehle congress ke chaatr sanghathan NSUI ke adhyaksh firoz khan par yon utpeedan ke aarope kaa maamla surkhiyon main aayaa tha
 The Congress came into action after being accused by a woman associated with the NSUI

 The committee was still investigating the case that the woman lodged a complaint with the police

 After this, Hefiroz Khan submitted his resignation and was accepted by the party
 darasal, congress ko dar tha ki, adhyaksh pad par rahete hue firoz adaalat jate to phir ulta vahi sawaal rahul par hi uthta, jo wo piem modi par khadaa kar rahe hai
 Political analysts believe that the party took this step to increase pressure on BJP, PM Modi and Akbar
 sutron kii maane to firoz apane vakeelon ke sampark main hai or party kii taraf se adaalat jane ke liye swatantra hai
 Manish Tiwari said on resignation- This is the tradition of the party, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari has said about Feroz Khan's resignation, 'the question is of tradition

 Attacking the Election Commission, Manish Sisodia said "why is the Education Department being prevented from taking voter cards, the Election Commission has no power to stop the Delhi government, the Election Commission's job is to vote in a fair manner, the Commission Don't support the education mafia like this " vah ek jugupsa paidaa karne vaala drishy he
 Not because it is being played to shoot Gandhi, but because it is being done so fantastically that there is no thought in it - not even the idea of killing Gandhi
 yah ek foohad tamaasha he jiske kuch gine-chune tamashbin hai
 Unfortunately, this pageant also becomes a 'hit'
 sirf ek khambe se duusare khambe tak daudta-bhaagta, haanfata or murda vichaaron par kisi giddh kii tarah jhapatata media is drishy ko bhi lapak letaa he
 The hypocritical politics suddenly becomes liberal towards Gandhi and the demand for arrest of these slogans begins
 tamaasha karne waalon kaa makasad itane bhar se sadh jaataa he
 He now has a national identity
 kal tak bilkul gumnaam rahe do vichaarviheen log ab desh ko bataa rahe hai ki unhen gandhi kii hatya ke naatak kaa koi pachhtaawaa nahin he or unhen afsos he ki is desh main deshadroh kii baat karne vaale aaazaad gum rahe hai, jabaki unhen giraftaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Are we satisfied now? After all, those who insult Gandhi, who hold violence against him, are caught
 jaahir he, iskaa jawaab 'haa' main nahin ho saktaa
 Because suddenly we find that in a hurry to save the Gandhi whom we had lost, we have given his so-called killers all-india fame and others also have the idea that Gandhi can become famous by killing 
 lekin kya yah gandhi ko maarane kii pehali koshish thi? yah to bas ek parody thi jisase gandhi yaa unke vichaar kaa kuch nahin bigadanaa tha
 Whereas in our whole public life, Gandhi idea is being tried in various ways
 jo gandhi ke virdohi hai, ve to yah kaam kar hi rahe hai, khud ko gandhi bhakt bataane vaale bhi chupchaap yahi kaam kar rahe hai
 Rather, in this country, a simple Gandhi of cleverness - a truncated Bonsai Gandhi - is being saved and difficult Gandhi is being sidelined
 aasaan gandhi vah he jo hamen 'lage raho munnabhai' jaisi filmon main dikhataa he
 This Gandhi opposes small injustices, fights his own battles with the help of non-violence and satyagraha and teaches not only NGO organizations but also political parties a way to fight
 lekin yah asli gandhi nahin he
 The real Gandhi demands a lot from us
 asli gandhi hamaari upabhoktavaadi jivan style kii aalochana karata he
 The real Gandhi advises to stay away from lawyers and doctors, the real Gandhi is almost 'anti-development' in the current idiom
 use hamaari chamak-damak vaali jivan style se parhez he
 He has an almost utopian view of the economy
 asli gandhi hamaare saamne jeene kii itani kadi kasautiyaan rakh detaa he ki ham chhitak kar dur ho jate hai
 This Gandhi does not digest us, does not suit us
 yah gandhi aatmanirikshan ke kinhin kshanon main hamaare bheetar sir uthaata he to ham use maar daalate hai
 Actually this is the real Gandhi whose murder we should be worried about
 lekin ham chintit tab hote hai jab ek nakli gandhi par nakli goli chalaai jaati he
 There are other ways to assassinate Gandhi
 unka andhanukaran bhi unako nirjeev murti main badalane kaa- or is tarah unki hatya karne kaa- ek or tarika he
 Gandhiji did not have such blind devotees during his lifetime
 unke sabase kareebi log bhi unase asahmat hua karte the
 Subhash Chandra Bose disagreed with Gandhi's methods; Jawaharlal also used to disagree with him
 baba sahab ambedkar to asahmat the hi
 Gandhi disagreed with Tagore and Tagore on many issues
 in asahmatiyon ne gandhi ko banaaya bhi
 Gandhi seems to be constantly disagreeing with the previous Gandhi in his later times
 dharm or varna sambandhi unki dharanaen bilkul puri tarah badalati dikhaai padati hai
 This was possible because despite Gandhi being called a Mahatma, his humanity was repeatedly tested
 us daur ke halaat bhi aise the jo unke liye nai-nai kasautiyaan banaate rahe
 But no one disagrees with Gandhi today
 kyonki gandhi anusaran kii nahin, puja kii vastu hai
 Worship is of idols, of idols
 isliye putalon par goli chalati he to hamen gussa aata he
 We are not a little restless when the real Gandhi is killed
 shaayad isliye ki hamaari shraddha bhi nakli he, hamaara gussa bhi nakli he
 We are not effeminate humans, angry effigies
 yah sthiti hamaari raajnneeti kii bhi he, hamaare media kii bhi
 His fast is over
 use gandhi se nahin, gandhi ke putale se matlab he, kyonki uski reporting aasaan he, yah sabit karnaa aasaan he ki goliyon se gandhi ko maaraa ja rahaa he
 And those who are gaining fame by killing Gandhi, their targets are actually second - far more dangerous
 gandhi par goli chalaa kar unhone ek vichaardhaara kii vaidhata hasil kar lee he- ab ve desh or dharm ke naam par kisi ko bhi goli maar sakate hai
 When they do this, they will not have fake guns in their hands
 tab bhi shaayad ham samaj nahin paaenge ki kaise apni nasamajhi main hamane kuch godse or paidaa kar die hai

 pichley saal sarkaar ko baqayada ek apil jari kerani padi thi jab chitah ke ek bachche ko doha main pakad liya gaya tha

 Not only Jawaharlal Nehru University, mtech and phd students of iits are also agitating for fee hike
 uttarakhand ke 16 ayurvedic kalejon ke chaatr bhi fees vruddhi ke khilaaf 43 dinon se andolan kar rahe hai
 This indicates that the poor economic situation has affected the common families
 jahaan naukariyaan ja rahi hon, selary na bad rahi ho, mazdooree ghat rahi ho, vahaan fees bade yah ajeeb he
 If government institutions are expensive, not everyone will get education
 jeenyu main sirf fees vruddhi ko lekar nahin balki hostal minial, librari ke samay ko lekar bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 Many people say that why do students agitate, the answer is that if you do not agitate, then what will happen in the university of the country, you will not know
 vaise hi logon kii chuppi uniwarsity ko kabad main badal rahi he jiskaa nuksaan aam logon ko hi ho rahaa he
 On November 11, a large number of students gathered on the Nelson Mandela Marg and started demonstrating
 maanav sansaadhan mantri ne jeenyu kii president oishi ghosh se baat kii
 The ministry was told that the dean of JNU will talk to the students on November 15, but the students say that the new manual will be approved in the executive council meeting of the university on November 13, so what is the benefit of the talks on November 15
 chaatr is baat par ade rahe ki uniwarsity nae hostal minial ko waapas len or chaatro se baat karne ke baad hi nae niyam banaae jaaen
 The students claim that the hostel manual was made without talking to the elected representative of the students
 ek november ko vaais chancelar ne apana paksh twit kiya tha
 It was told that for the last 14 years, the same rule is that students have to return to the hostel by 11 pm or half an hour after the library is closed
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki niyam vahi he magar ab ise lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Why should a hostel arrive in a campus college by 11 am
 abhi tak to chaatr raat bhar librari main hote the, chaay lekar dhabas par charchaa karte the, to isse kya nuksaan ho gaya
 JNU is a campus university
 vahaan raat bhar librari nahin khulegi to kahaan khulegi
 The picture of jnu's library remains forever in the hearts of the students who pass here
 raat andhere kisi raste se kitaab liye aata koi chaatr padhaaku dikhne ke liye nahin balki kitabon ke bich jeene marane ke liye librari main vakt bitaata he
 This library changed the lives of so many students
 pehle librari ke kai reeding room puri raat khule rahete the
 Now students say that not a single reading room will be open overnight
 website par aa gaya he ki special reeding haul or general reeding haul ab subah 9 baje se raat 12 baje tak hi khule rahenge
 Do not judge the condition of the library of JNU, even after this, the students here did wonders all over the world
 vaise aapako bataa den ki america main america uniwarsity aaf california barkali kii librari kaa bajet he 461 karod
 Many of its reading rooms are open 24 hours
 der raat librari se hostal tak jane ke liye transport kii suvidha milti he
 The world will laugh if it is known that a university library like JNU is not open overnight
 naan resident indian new jersey main shame se kisi ko bataa nahin paaenge
 IIT Delhi is next to JNU
 yahaan kii librari ke kuch reeding room 24 ghante khule rahete hai
 Why jnu's library should be closed at 12 o'clock
 sonipat main ek privet uniwarsity he ashoka, uski librari ke reeding room saaton din or 24 ghante khule rahete hai
 In August last year, there has been an agitation regarding the time of library at Hidayatullah National Law University, Raipur
 uniwarsity ne faisla kiya ki librari saadhe das baje band ho jaaegi
 Students started demanding that it be open 24 hours
 chaatr samay isliye maang rahe the ki class 3 baje tak khatm hoti thi
 After a little rest, the library needed a longer time, if it closed at ten and a half, then it would not get a full chance
 jab baaki neshnal lau uniwarsity kii librari 10 baje raat se lekar 3 baje subah tak khuli ho sakati he to hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity aaf lau kii librari bhi raat bhar khuli rahe
 The movement went on and the students were successful
 ab raipur kii yah librari 3 baje subah tak khuli rahati he
 In April this year, there was an agitation for the Guru Tegh Bahadur Reading Room at Punjab University
 is andolan ke baad hi guru teg bahadur reeding room or asi joshi librari kaa pehla floor shaam 6 baje se lekar agali subah 6 baje khulaa rakhana padaa
 Don't you want the library to remain open overnight
 ab aate hai fees par
 JNU fees are low, so hundreds of poor students of India have benefited from this
 ve isaki vajah se jeenyu se pard sake
 a student named Sushil Jha, a former BBC journalist, has made a comment on his poverty and experience of this fee
 susheel ne likhaa he ki bhartiya jansanchaar santhaan main second topper tha magar naukari nahin mili
 So i wanted to read JNU
 jeenyu kaa farm bhar diya magar taiyaari kii kitaaben nahin thim
 Money did not come from home and was not with himself
 doston ke saath jeenyu kii mess main khaanaa kha letaa tha
 Mess workers also used to feed
 jeenyu ke bas stand par soya hum kyonki sone kii jagah nahin thi
 One day a senior from JNU saw it, gave it a place in his room and filled my form
 taiyaari ke liye kitaaben de deen
 When i am hungry, i have a wet swab tied on my stomach and have studied
 admishan ho gaya lekin mess bill bharne kaa paisa nahin tha
 Father could not even pay 1000 rupees a month
 chah maheene tak ek dost ne mess bill ke paise die
 If the semester fees were as much as today, i would not be able to read correctly
 mere jaise kai garib chaatr aaj bhi jeenyu main hai
 a few years ago, when i was coming to campus with a bullet, a boy was walking in a sandal, there was sadness on his face
 usne haath diya to maine gaadi par bitha liya
 Talking about things happened
 main poochne laga to vahi sab jawaab mila
 Father was a farmer
 maheene ke mess bill kaa aath sau rupaya tak bhej nahin paa rahe the
 Many people start talking about the matter of fees
 chaatr juuta kharid lete hai lekin fees nahin denge
 Watch the film but will not pay the fees
 morrkhtaa ke in daavon kaa kuch nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This question can be asked how many students are from poor farmers and common families in JNU and what is their economic income
 2017-18 kii salanaa report ke anusaar 1556 chaatro main se 623 chaatr aise pariwaron se aae jinaki masik aay 12000 rupee se kam thi
 These are 40 percent
 904 chaatr aise the jinke parivaar kii masik aayaa 12000 se adhik thi
 This is the economic profile of the students there
 kya ham nahin chaahate ki gaanv or garib pariwaron ke bachche acchhee uniwarsity main padhein
 In 2017-18, 684 students were from the village
 abhi tak jeenyu hostal ke bijli pani or anya suvidhaon ke liye das karod kahaan se de rahaa tha, ab kyon nahin de paa rahaa he jo iskaa bhaar chaatro par daalaa ja rahaa he
 Earlier room rent was Rs 10 which is now being Rs 300 per month
 mess sicurity ke liye ek baar main 5500 rupee dene padate the jo ab 12000 rupee kiya ja rahaa he
 It gets refunded but asking for Rs 12000 at a time which will be refunded
 yah isliye karnaa pad rahaa he kyonki difalter bad gaye hai
 Fees are being increased after ten years
 abhi aapane suna ki jo chaatr 800 rupaya nahin de saktaa usase agar 12000 rupee liye jaaenge to vah kahaan se degaa
 Parimal has spoken to some such students
 jo aise pariwaron se aate hai jinke liye 1000 rupee kii badhottaree bhi lakh ke samaan he
 There is a movement in IIT Mumbai and IIT BHU over the increase in fees for mtech
 300 pratishat fees badi he
 Increased from 50,000 to two lakhs
 emtek ke chaatro ko jo masik wajipha miltaa tha wo band kar diya gaya he
 Obviously, the poor students who reach there will be in trouble
 to fees vruddhi ko lekar sirf jeenyu main andolan nahin ho rahaa he
 Students of the Ayurvedic Medical College of Uttarakhand are also agitating for the fee hike
 uttarakhand main hai court kii single or phir dabl bench ne faisla diya he ki ayurvedic medical kalege main fees vriddhi kii faisla waapas hoga
 Suddenly the fees were increased to 2 lakh 15 thousand instead of 80,000 years
 chaatr disambar 2016 se court main ladaai lard rahe hai
 On October 9, it was decided that the fee hike is not right
 badi hui fees waapas len lekin abhi tak faisle par amal nahin hua he
 For 43 days these students have been protesting in Dehradun
 ye itane amir nahin hai ki sava do lakh fees de den
 So you should not make fun of the fee hike because JNU students are opposing, the fee hike is being opposed by students of IIT Mumbai, BHU and students of Uttarakhand are also opposing the hike
 iskaa matlab he ki jab arthvyavastha down ho to logon par asar pad rahaa hoga
 The fees must be stinging, so don't make fun of them

 Vijayan had said, some vested interests tend to tarnish the image of those involved in politics and there have been occasions when some people have fallen prey to these tendencies
 ek loktantric samaaj aise najariye ko durust karke hi aage bad saktaa he
 ' team india ke sabase vivaadit coach rahe greg chapel ko lekarmaster blaster sachin tendulkar ne apni autobiography main jo kuch khulaasa kiyausake baad saurav ganguli ne is par pratikriya di he

" rahul captain bana or aath maheene baad use ek or captain (sachin ke rup main) kii jarurat thi

 'hopefully, i too will be able to show my side someday, hoping that one day he too will be able to tell his side of the story
