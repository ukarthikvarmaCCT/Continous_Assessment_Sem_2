 Often in Holi colors we ignore our health and skin

 surakshit holi manaane ke upaay:-rang khilne se pehle puure kapade pahanakar hi baahar nikalen taaki twachaa sidhe rangon ke sampark main nahin aae
 The colors can cause irritation and itching
 -rang khilne se pehle baalo ko bhi acchhee tarah dhak len
 If you want, you can use head covering hat, turban or dupatta
 -sharir or baalo par acchhee tarah tel lagaaein
 Applying oil does not add color to the body and makes it easy to clean
 yahhanikaarak rasayanon se tvchaaki raksha bhi karata he
 Apply nail polish on nails beforehand
 isse nakhunon par rang nahin chadhega
 - Apply Vaseline on the nails, ears and lips before playing the Holi

 Use a cleanser to remove color
 aap chahen to rang chhudaane ke liye neembu kaa istemaal bhi kar sakate hai
 - After playing the holi, wash the face with cold water
 rang hataane ke liye jaitoon ke tel kaa bhi istemaal karnaa phydemand rahegaa

 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam ke rujhaan sabhi 199 siton par aa gaye hai, jisamen congress sarkaar banaati najar aa rahi he
 Former Congress Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has considered these results as a sign of the next Lok Sabha elections
 congress ko mauka milane kii vajah bataate hue gahalot bole ki ye baat main dilli main bhi kah chukaa hum ki hamaare congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne narendra modi ko unke khud ke rajya main, amit shah ko unke khud ke rajya main jis prakaar gheraa, vah puraa desh dekh rahaa tha
 After that, he is unable to stand up
 vah samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan ke parinaam aise kyon aa rahe hai
 They are coming because they were so surrounded that they could not answer any issue
 bina ishyu ke ellection ladaa he un logon ne
 He was in power, so those who were not there, made him issue
 kabhi gujarat kii beijjati ho rahi he, kabhi meri beijjatiho rahi he, kabhi puri kaum kii beijjati ho rahi he
 He spoke this language and won the election technically
 ye na bijepi kii jeet thi or na congress kii haar thi
 i can say this with a claim
 puraa desh is baat ko maanata he
 In order to force the RBI Governor to resign, Gahlhot also added that the RBI Governor has said that you will see more changes in the coming years
 karnataka main unki sarkaar nahin ban pai
 The kind of atmosphere in the country today
 gahalot ne kaha ki desh kii sanvaidhannik sansthaaen barbaad ho rahi hai
 The resignation of the RBI governor is not a minor incident
 purv arabiai garvanar raghuram rajan ne khud ye kaha he ki arabiai garvanar koi clerk nahin he jo khud jaakar istipha de de
 Unless such an environment has been created by the government
 unhen majaboor hokar istipha dena padaa
 This is probably the first event after 25–30 years
 desh main jis tarah shashan, usase log dukhirahul ke chunavi tareekon kii tarif karte hue gahalot ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne janata se jude muddon ko in chunaavon main uthaaya
 The youth are not getting jobs
 karpshan ko mudde par amit shah ke bete ko gheraa
 Raised the issue of inflation
 tel kii antarrrashtriya keemtenkam ho rahi hai, yahaan badhati ja rahi hai
 She reduced it when the elections came
 ye tamaam log jis tarah se desh main shashan kar rahe hai, unase log dukhi hai
 No one is speaking, no one is daring
 lekin log aage is par jarur baat karenge
 People are starting to believe that the election results are not a good day, Gehlot said that the atmosphere that has been created now is an indication of what is going to happen in the Lok Sabha elections
 abhi tak inkaa ek aabhamandal ban gaya tha lekin ab log ye maanane lage hai ki achche din nahin aae
 Neither 2 crore people get jobs every year
 blikemani ek bhi nahin ai
 This situation is in front of everyone
 jiskaa parinaam is vidhansabha chunaav main najar aa rahaa he or aage bhi aayega
 Is it Narendra Modi's defeat or Vasundhara Raje? When asked whether it is Narendra Modi's defeat or Vasundhara Raje's answer, Gehlot said in response, "let the results come now, then we will sit down and talk about it
" demokrasi kahati he sabko milakar chalojab gahalot se sawaal poocha gaya ki nirdaleey kah rahe hai ki yadi congress kii sarkaar banati he to ve unke saath honge
 Replying to this, Gehlot said that democracy says, "come together everyone
" parinaam aane dijie, phir is par baat karenge
 It is such that the trend of election results in Rajasthan has resulted in the results of Rajasthan assembly elections in all 199 seats, in which Congress is seen forming the government
 pradesh main 200 vidhansabha siton main 199 siton par voting hui he or 2274 ummidavaar chunavi maidan main hai
 One thing is also clear from the current election results, the fact that the anger was being spoken against Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress's clean sweep in exit polls, the actual results were reversing
 Huh
 rajasthan main chunaavprachaar ke dauraan bhale hi 'modi se bair nahin, vasundhara teri khayr nahin' jaise naaron kii gunj sunai di ho, lekin bijepi ke pradarshan ko sammanjanak mana ja rahaa he
 Actually, see the election results of 2003 and 2008 and 2013, there was a change of power in every election, but the difference of seats between BJP and Congress has been interesting
 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 120 siten mili thim or vasundhara raaje ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkarbani thi
 Raje commanded the state for the first time
 iske baad 2008 ke chunaav hue to congress ko 96 siten milin or bijepi 78 siton ke saath bahumat se 23 seat dur rah gai

 Remember that tremendous enthusiasm? When Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal made his first major foray into Punjab and he was given a rousing welcome with loud slogans at the Maghi fair in January
 do took kahen to us vakt unhone bhagat singh ke andaaj main basanti sikh pagadi bhi baandh rakhi thi
 Showing his fighting attitude, Kejriwal promised to uproot corruption, narcotics and all other evils from Punjab
 yahaan tak ki unhone naam lekar hamale kiye the—unhone vaada kiya tha ki agar satta main aae to ''vikram majithia (shiromani akali dal ke mantri or upmukhyamantri sukhbir badal ke saale) ko kaanon se pakad ghasitkar laaenge or jail main daal denge
 "the crowd then took them in hand and in just six months after the start of organization in the state, AAP was seen moving towards a successful success
" vah punjab ke siyaasi akhaade kaa nayaa or utsaahi pahalwaan thi
 But suddenly things are not looking so spectacular now
 aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye party ke tikat bechney se lekar sambhavit ummidavaaron se kendriya paryvekshakon ke yon anugrahon kii maang karne tak, ek ke baad ek sangeen aaropon ke bich amritsar loksabhaa nirvachan kshetra ke lambey vakt se aap ke kshetreey prabharee 50 varshiya gurinder singh bajva ne 4 sitambar ko party chhodie kaa elaan kar diya
 a large number of 85 other officials also resigned
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki istipha dene waalon main amritsar-gurdaspur kii sarahadi pattee main aap ke 80 fisadi ahm kaaryakarta shaamil hai
 These mass resignations came after the AAP central leadership's decision on 27 August in which state convenor Sucha Singh Chhotepur was expelled from the party
 soobe ke siyaasi diggaj or purv akali netaa chhotepur ne rajya main party ko khadaa karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Chhotepur was removed after a sting operation which, according to many, was done at the behest of Delhi AAP leaders and they were caught taking Rs 2 lakh from a party worker
 chhotepur kii jagah ab tivi ke hansod gurprit singh 'ghuggi' ko laayaa gaya he
 Apparently 'outsiders' and 'delhiites' —the 54 AAP leaders and supervisors led by Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak — are what the activists of the state call it — they had no idea that the party was standing in the state Chotepur had acquired such deep roots
 chhotepur ko baahar karne ke mahaj do din baad 30 agast ko aap ke 13 kshetreey samanvayakon (har loksabhaa nirvachan kshetra ke liye ek) ne kendriya netritv ko ultimatum de diya ki chhotepur ko behaal karo or sanjay-durgesh kii jodi ko punjab se waapas bulaao
 After the ultimatum, a series of mass resignations began
 keval amritsar main hi nahin, balki mansa, bathinda, ferozepur or faridakot main bhi
 With this journey from the party, all the mud and dirt buried in the foothills came out
 udhar, bijwasan (dilli) se party ke vidhayak devinder saharaavat ne kejariwal ko likhi apni chitthee jari kar di, jisamen unhone punjab main netaaon kii kathith 'yon charitraheenta' ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 Shortly thereafter, an AAP faction in Barnala in Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann's home constituency issued an audio recording alleging that a supervisor from Delhi, Vijay Chauhan sexually abused a maid whom he had worked with in Punjab
 was kept

 notebandi ke faisle lagu hue 40 din beete chuke hai
 Long lines are still not decreasing outside banks and atms
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke khilaaf vipaksh ne sadak se lekar sansad tak hangaamaa kiya
 But the government has made it clear that there is no question of reconsideration of this decision
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 500 or 1000 rupee ke note ke band hone se kaledhan par lagaam lagegaa or desh main bhrashtachar kam hoga
 But the opposition is trying to misinterpret the bets of the government
 is bich notebandi ke 40 din puure hone par 'aaj tak' ne netaaon or arthshaastriyon ko lekar ek badi bahes kaa aayojan kiya
 In which the people present gave their views

 Rajiv Kumar, Black money is reaching the bank in a direct manner with the decision of the Economynotbandi
 ye faisla deshhit main he or logon ko sarkaar ko or vakt dena chahie
 If the government has given time on 31 December, then it does not mean that if people face some problems due to demonetisation on the next day i
e
 after 1 January, then open a front against the government
 sarkaar ko kam se kam farvari tak vakt dena chahie
 Black moneyers are terrified of demonetisation
 jahaan tak logon kii pareshaani kii baat he to agle kuch dinon main sthiti saamaanya hone kii ummid he
 Sunil Alagh, Brand Consulted There is corruption in the DNA of the people of India, as no strict steps have been taken so far to curb corruption
 kanoon to bahut he lekin use lagu karne main ichhashakti kii kami dikhaai di
 Banning black money is not possible only by banning notes
 sarkaar ko kaledhan par karrwai ke liye abhi or majboot kadam uthaane kii zarurat he
 People are still fearlessly turning black to white and the government is only talking about action
 kyonki sarkaar ke paas koi sateek rodmap nahin jisase ye kaha ja sake ki ab kaledhan vaale nahin batch paaenge
 Giving time to black money again and again shows that there is definitely a deficiency in the strategy designed to curb black money and corruption

 Gaurav Gogoi, Spokesperson, Congress Central Government did not consult the economists regarding the demonetization decision
 jis vajah se logon ko pareshaani ho rahi he
 This is a decision taken in arrogance
 notebandi se aam logon ke saath-saath desh ko baari nuksaan hone vaala he
 While the black with black have so far managed to whiten
 vahiin sarkaar ke is faisle se kisaan, vyapaaree or chote kaarobaari tabaahi ke kagaar par hai
 Sambit Patra, Spokesperson, bjpnotbandi is a strict step
 piem modi ne raajnneeti ke upar uthakar ye faisla liya he
 Earlier, the government used to think about such a decision but could not muster courage
 jisase desh main kalaadhan or bhrashtachar bad gaya
 Since demonetisation, black money-keepers are in panic and if they are engaged in blacking the blacks through other ways, then they are also being closely eyed by the Income Tax Department
 vipaksh keval notebandi ke faisle ko lekar logon ko gumraah kar rahaa he
 While the people of the country are with the decision
 vipaksh ko bhi raajnneeti ke upar uthakar sarkaar ko samarthan karnaa chahie taaki desh tarakkee kii raah par jo chalaa he usapar brake naa lage
 Mohammad Salim, Leader, CPM Demonetisation will not curb corruption
 notebandi se blike mani waalon ko koi pareshaani nahin hui or wo kaale ko safed karne main kaamyaab rahe, jabaki aam aadmi jiske paas mehnatee kii kamai he or notebandi ke baad avyavashtha se pareshaan hai

 Gangulyka believes that with such a team, India can make an impact in the Cricket Mahakumbh starting from 19 February in Dhaka
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘2003 kii tarah is baar bhi ham sakaaratmak soch ke saath utar rahe hai or hamaare paas aisi vyavasthit team he jo pichley kuch samay se acha pradarshan kar rahi he

 He, however, refused to make any prediction for this time
 unhone kaha, ‘vyaktigat taur par main kisi team ko khitaab kaa prabal daavedaar maanane main vishwaas nahin karata
 This is a tournament in which the last three matches from the quarter-finals will make a complete difference
 australia, bharat or dakshin africa kaaphi majboot dikh rahe hai
 He recalled the memories of 2003, saying, "our team was strong and we did well throughout the tournament
" hamane australia (final main) ko chhodkar prayek team ko haraaya
 We played cricket fearlessly
 sabhi khilaadi farm main the tathaa team ne jis tarah se ekajute hokar khel dikhaaya vah bejod tha
 Ganguly said he did not regret the decision to bowl first against Australia in the final
 australia ne 359 ran banaaye or bharat 125 ran se match haar gaya tha
 He said, 'I still believe that was not a wrong decision
 match kii pehali raat ko barish hui thi or pich main nami thi
 You may remember that the match started late
 gend subah thodaa seem le rahi thi lekin unhone hamen khel ke har vibhaag main maat di
 Ganguly said, "A target of 260 or 270 could have been achieved then but it is difficult to chase a score of over 350 in the World Cup final
 yah niraashajanak he ki ham 2003 kaa vishwa cap nahin jeet paye
 "ganguly said about the team's first round exit in 2007," the story completely changed there
 hamaari shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi or bangladesh se haarane se team kaa manobal gir gaya
 It became the turning point

 kya parshad naalon kii safai ko lekar sanjeeda nahin he, kya parshadon ko dilliwaalon kii parvaah nahin he, kya water loging ko lekar parshad beparwaah hai
 All these questions are arising because no councilor gave the status report of the cleaning when the Mayor asked the councilors of East Delhi, who were alleging that the drains were not being cleaned
 ab bhala koi parshad hi dhyaan na de, to phir afasar kyon parvaah karenge
 The mayor of the East MCD is angry, the reason why the councilors are not active in cleaning the drains in their area, even the status report the mayor had asked was not given by the councilors
 emsidi east ke meyar annapurna mishra kehete hai, ‘ek bhi parshad ne mujhe report nahin di he, ab pataa nahin kyon nahin di ye aap unase puuchhie, naalon kii safai ke bare main unase poocha tha, wo bataa sakate hai, mere paas to jaankaree nahin he, main visit karuungi to bataaungi
 The mayor had set a deadline of June 15 to clean the drains and asked the councilors what was the condition of cleaning the drains in their wards
 lekin parshad hai ki apni hi daleel de rahe hai, unka kahana he ki afasar unki sunate hi nahin he
 Councilor Preeti says, "our officers do not listen, the officials of PWD are drains, they do not talk, it has become very difficult
 ’parshadon ke apane bahaane hai, lekin jamini hakeekat ye he ki naalon se keechad nikaalane kaa kaam zamin par kam or kaagazon main zyada ho rahaa he
 In this way, the councilors make a ruckus in the house and make noise even when the drains are not cleaned, but the reality is that when it came to giving the status report, not a single councilor gave it

 According to him, 2,360 patients in the capital have benefitted from the scheme so far

 On the other hand BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said that once this scheme is implemented in Delhi, people will get another reason to support Modiji

 He said that the Aam Aadmi Party was expected to win all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, but Muslim voters voted in Confusion, causing some voters to shift to Congress
 iske alaava rajendra paal gautam ne aarope lagaaya ki voting se do raat pehle garib votaron ko paise baante gaye, jiske chalate bhi vot transfar hue hai
 Rajendra Pal Gautam is also an MLA from Seemapuri Assembly of north-east Delhi
 aapako bataa den ki dilli kii saat loksabhaa siton par ravivaar 12 may ko chhathwein charan main vot daale gaye the or kul matdaan 60
 52 percent was recorded
 dilli kii saat loksabhaa siton main se uttari-purvi dilli loksabhaa seat par sabase zyada voting hui thi
 63 here
 39 fisadi logon ne apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal kiya tha
 This Lok Sabha constituency has the largest Muslim population of Delhi
 yahaan kareeb 23 fisadi muslim he, jisamen silampur or mustafabad jaise muslim bahul ilaake aate hai
 There is a contest between Congress candidate Sheila Dixit, BJP candidate Manoj Tiwari and Aam Aadmi Party candidate Dilip Pandey from north-east Delhi Lok Sabha seat
 vahiin, uttar purvi dilli ke alaava chandani chowk or purvi dilli loksabhaa seat par bhi muslim votaron kii taadaad nirnaayak he
 In the election campaign, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal was constantly pleading not to distribute votes
 aap ko ye aas thi ki bijepi ke virodh main muslam samaaj kaa vot use ekatarfa milegaa
 But after voting, the discussion was that the Congress part has also got the vote of Muslim society
 is charchaa kii ab kejariwal ke mantri ne pushti kar di he or kaha he ki muslim votaron ne kanfusion main voting jiske chalate congress ko bhi unka vot gaya
 Exclusive Question to AAP Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam
 Answer: Question - What is the assessment of the Aam Aadmi Party after voting on May 12? Answer - Around 67% of the votes have been cast in my Assembly
 iske alaava garmiyon kaa asar tha or purvaanchaliyon ke yahaan shaadiyaan thim, jiske chalate wo apane gaanv chale gaye the
 Along with this, the effect of Roje was also seen in voting
 haalanki iske baavjood acha vot padaa
 Question- Whether Aam Aadmi Party got votes in north-east Delhi Lok Sabha seat or not? If not received, why not? Answer: Aam Aadmi Party got a lot of votes in the north-east Delhi Lok Sabha seat
 kuch bijepi kaa vot bhi hamen mila, lekin hamaara kor voter shila dikshit or congress kii taraf shift hua he
 The reason is 2 nights before the election
 chunaav se do din pehle ham ekatarfa jeet rahe the, lekin ab jeet kaa antar lakhon vot kii bajaay hajaar tak rah saktaa he
 Question- What game are you talking about on the night before the election? Answer - We have received a complaint that in north-east Delhi Lok Sabha seat, huge amount was distributed overnight
 voting khatm hone ke baad hamen votaron ne paisa baantne kii jaankaree di
 Most of the poor people voted with money, due to which the votes were transferred
 uttari-purvi loksabhaa kii simapuri vidhansabha main acha vot margin dilip pandeya ko milegaa
 However, there is a competition of cut in many other assemblies, due to which the margin of victory will be reduced now
 sawaal- saat seat jeetne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa tha, kya voting ke baad akalan main siten kam ho rahi hai?jawaab -ham vishwaas kar rahe the ki aam aadmi party ko sabhi saat siten milengi, lekin log vot dete vakt kanphyus ho gaye the
 In particular, Muslims voted in Confusion, due to which some percentage of the vote has shifted towards the Congress and the seven seats which they were hoping to win have been weakened
 ab ho saktaa he ki saat main se ek yaa do seat kam aaen
 Question - What is the reason for Muslim votes to be divided in Delhi? Answer - Actually, this confusion was spread among the people that Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi and Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi in the center
 ye sandesh dene kii koshish congress kii taraf se kii gai
 This message was spread 2 days before voting and we could not catch it, but hope to win 5 out of 7 seats
 sawaal- koun-koun si siton par jeet milane kii ummid he?jawaab-mujhe lagata he ki yamuna paar kii donon seat ham jeet rahe hai
 Raghav is also winning Chadha's South Delhi Lok Sabha seat and North West Delhi Lok Sabha seat
 haalanki chandani chowk or nai dilli loksabhaa main kaante kii takkar ho sakati he
 Question- The functioning of the Delhi government was much publicized, did not people vote after seeing the work of the government? Answer- After voting, the public openly said that the work of Delhi is no match and the Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi Assembly Will win, but it was Lok Sabha election
 sawaal- jald hi dilli main vidhansabha chunaav honge, kya loksabhaa chunaav ke rigelt kaa tab asar hoga?jawaab-dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main is chunaav kaa koi asar nahin hoga
 However, nothing is stable in politics
 samay-samay par ranneeti badalani hoti he or is par aam aadmi party manthan karegi
 If seven seats do not win and only 5 seats are won, then we will assess how many votes were cast in each booth

 After the Mumbai attack, on 13 February 2009, Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik, during a press conference, admitted that Pakistan's land was partially used for the Mumbai attack and caught some suspects against whom criminal prosecution has been started
 is
 lekin pakistan kii sarkaar un sabake kilaaf bhi apni adaalaton main sabit nahin kar pai
 The evidence given by India regarding the Mumbai attacks was also not accepted in the Adiala court in Rawalpindi
 lihaaza hafiz said lahore court se or zakiur rahamaan lakhvi adiyaala court se reeha ho gaya
 In the Pathankot case too, Pakistan has not named anyone in the FIR registered, while India considers Masood Azhar as the main accused for this attack
 kya hoga agar pakistan kii team laut kar yah kah de ki hamen jo saboot dikhaaye gaye wo paryaapt nahin he tab bharat kya karegaa
 It is true that the Indian team has got a chance to present its evidence in front of the Pakistan team too
 chaar saal pehle bharat kii jaanch agency ne david hedli se america jaakar poochtacha kii thi
 Still, his testimony is recorded here only through video link from USA
 is tarah se dekha jaae to america ko david hedli se poochtacha karne ke liye bhartiya agency ko anumati hi nahin deni chahie thi
 The comments ai es ai kaa adhikari hone ke kaaran yah daura raajnneetik virodh kaa kaaran ban rahaa he yaa pakistani team ke kaaran hi
 Now the question is whether Pakistan will allow India to interrogate from Hafiz Saeed to Masood Azhar
 bharat kahata he ki vah maang karegaa
 All this was happening when the Public Relations Agency of Pakistan Army released a video in another case
 is video main kulbhushan jadhav sweekaar kar rahe hai ki wo ro ke liye kaam karte hai
 Lt
 General Asim Bajwa and Information Minister Pervez Rasheed were present in this press conference
 bajva ne kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav RAW chif, neshnal security adwiser or RAW joint secretary se sidhe taur par sampark main tha
 Through Jadhav, Pakistan's military officer alleged that this is a type of state-sponsored terrorism and what would be the clearest evidence that India is interfering in Pakistan
 usne bataaya he ki wo ab bhi bhartiya nausena main karyrat he or 2022 ko ritair hoga
 He told that RAW joined him in 2013 and since then he has been doing a lot of activities in Karachi and Bluechistan as the RAW said
 karachi main kanoon or vyavastha bigaadane kii koshish main rahaa
 The Defense Minister of India has admitted that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a former Navy officer, but has denied involvement in any intelligence activity on behalf of India
 raksha mantri ne kaha tha ki jadhav ko jo bhi madad kii zarurat hogi, di jaaegi
 The video was released at a time when the Pakistani investigation team is present in India and the opposition parties are making various allegations against the government
 haalanki donon maamle alag hai magar video ke zariye kaboolnamaa jari karne se ek baar vahi puraani ashankaayen jaagti to hai ki kya vaaki jaanch dal ke daure jaisi gatividhiyon se koi laabh hoga
 But the government of Pakistan could not prove them even in their courts
 bharat ne mumbai hamalon se jude jo saboot die the ve bhi rawalpindi ke adiyaala court main nahin sweekaar nahin kiye gaye
 So Hafiz Saeed was released from Lahore Court and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi from Adiala Court
 pathankot maamle main bhi pakistan ne jo epa ai aar darj kii he usamen kisi kaa naam nahin liya he jabaki bharat is hamale ke liye masood azhar ko mukhya aaropee maanata he
 What if Pakistan's team returns and says that the evidence shown to us is not enough then what India will do
 yah sahi he ki pakistan kii team ke saamne bhartiya team ko bhi apane saboot rakhane kaa mauka mila he wo bhi aamane-saamne
 Four years ago, the Indian investigative agency interrogated David Headley in the United States
 abhi bhi america se video link ke zariye hi uski gavaahi yahaan ricard kii jaati he
 If seen in this way, America should not have allowed the Indian agency to interrogate David Headley
 tippaniyan Being an ISI officer, the tour is causing political opposition or due to the Pakistani team
 ab sawaal he ki kya pakistan bharat ko hafiz said se lekar masood azhar tak se poochtacha karne degaa
 India says it will demand
 yah sab ho rahaa tha tabhi ek anya maamle main pakistan kii sena kii jansampark agency ne ek video jari kar diya
 In this video, Kulbhushan Jadhav is admitting that he works for Raw
 is press conference main leftinent general aseem bajva or soochna mantri parvaiz raashid maujuud the
 Bajwa said that Kulbhushan Jadhav was in direct contact with RAW Chief, National Security Advisor and RAW Joint Secretary
 jadhav ke zariye pakistan ke sainik adhikari ne aarope lagaaya ki ye ek kism kaa rajya dwaara pryojit aatankwaad he or isse zyada saaf saboot kya hoga ki bharat kaa pakistan main dakhal he
 He has stated that he is still working in the Indian Navy and will retire on 2022
 usne bataaya ki RAW ne use 2013 main apane saath joda or tabase wo karachi or bluechistan main RAW ke kahe anusaar kai activities karata rahaa
 Law and order in Karachi tried to spoil
 bharat ke raksha mantri ne yah to mana he ki kulbhushan jadhav purv navy afasar he, lekin bharat kii taraf se kisi bhi khufia gatividhi main shaamil hone se inkaar kiya he
 The Defense Minister had said that Jadhav would be given whatever help he needed
 ye video us samay jari kiya gaya jab pakistani jaanch dal bharat main maujuud he or virdohi dal sarkaar par tarah tarah ke aarope laga rahe hai
 Though the two cases are different, the release of confession through video once raises the same old apprehensions as to whether there will be any benefit from activities such as visiting the investigation team
 kya hoga agar pakistan kii team laut kar yah kah de ki hamen jo saboot dikhaaye gaye wo paryaapt nahin he tab bharat kya karegaa
 It is true that the Indian team has got a chance to present its evidence in front of the Pakistan team too
 chaar saal pehle bharat kii jaanch agency ne david hedli se america jaakar poochtacha kii thi
 Still, his testimony is recorded here only through video link from USA
 is tarah se dekha jaae to america ko david hedli se poochtacha karne ke liye bhartiya agency ko anumati hi nahin deni chahie thi
 The comments ai es ai kaa adhikari hone ke kaaran yah daura raajnneetik virodh kaa kaaran ban rahaa he yaa pakistani team ke kaaran hi
 Now the question is whether Pakistan will allow India to interrogate from Hafiz Saeed to Masood Azhar
 bharat kahata he ki vah maang karegaa
 All this was happening when the Public Relations Agency of Pakistan Army released a video in another case
 is video main kulbhushan jadhav sweekaar kar rahe hai ki wo ro ke liye kaam karte hai
 Lt
 General Asim Bajwa and Information Minister Pervez Rasheed were present in this press conference
 bajva ne kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav RAW chif, neshnal security adwiser or RAW joint secretary se sidhe taur par sampark main tha

 Facing constant criticism on the employment issue, the Modi government is conducting a large survey for the unorganized sector
 berogari ke aankadon ko galat tehraate hue aksar modi sarkaar ke mantri yah tark dete rahe hai ki in aankadon main asangathit kshetra ke logon ko shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 PM Modi himself had argued that selling pakoda is also an employment
 to kya is sector ke liye modi sarkaar kuch bada soch rahi he? inke bare main kya he modi sarkaar kii yojana? 5 july ko bajet pesh karne ja raheen vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke pitare se hi iskaa raaj khulegaa
 Why is the need for a survey of those who sell pakodas? In fact, for the last few years, the Modi government has been constantly on the target of opposition on the employment front
 sarkaar ke sanghathan neshnal cemple survey offis (eneseso) ke aankadon ke mutabik saal 2017-18 main bharat main berogari dar 45 saal ke record str par 6
 Reached 1 percent
 duusari taraf, modi sarkaar ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki in aankadon main chote rojgaar karne vaale dukandaaron, choti dukaanon par naukari karne vaale jaise asangathit kshetra ke lakhon logon ko shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 Employment figures have been tarnishing the reputation of the Modi government to the country and the world
 is pratishtha ko chamakaane ke liye hi ipiefo main namakan ke aankade bhi aksar jari kar yah bataane kii koshish kii jaati he ki desh main rojgaar kii kami nahin he
 So by conducting a comprehensive economic survey of the unorganized sector, the Modi government wants to present large data of employment
 'bajet 2019 kii vistrut kawarej ke liye yahaan clic karen'kaise hoga sarveyjun maheene se shuru is survey main aise udhyamon, dukaanon-sansthaanon, rehadi, patari par kaam karne waalon par vishesh dhyaan diya jayega, jahaan kaam karne vaale logon kii sankhya 10 se kam he
 According to an estimate, the total workforce in India is more than 13 crore, but about 2 of them
 5 karod hi sangathit kshetra main he
 Self-employed shopkeepers will also be counted in this economic survey
 iske tahat lagbhag 27 karod gharon or 7 karod pratishthanon kaa aarthik surveykshan hoga
 Different teams will go to rural and urban areas of the country for economic census
 ye log ghar-ghar jaakar aarthik aadhaar par janaganana kaa kaam karenge
 It can cost about 300 crores rupees
 kya hoga phaaydacendre sarkaar ko lagata he ki asangathit kshetra main rojgaar kii gananaa se desh main jobs ke aankade sudharenge or ise vipaksh ke hamalon kaa jawaab diya ja sakegaa
 It may be that the Modi government is preparing a big scheme for the welfare of this class
 mana ja rahaa he ki is surveykshan ke baad rehadi-patari vaale kaarobaari bhi mukhyadhara main shaamil ho sakenge or unhen lone aadi sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh mil sakegaa
 The budget of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman can give an indication about what the government is going to do for this sector next
 to is sector se jude karodon logon ko kya bajet main milegaa koi bada gift? yah jaanane ke liye bas kuch ghanton kaa intjaar he

 centre kii modi sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko haj sabsidi khatm karne kaa faisla kiya
 The decision will be applicable from this year
 ise lekar paksh or vipaksh main tamaam tark die ja rahe hai to siyasat bhi shuru ho gai he
 However, the abolition of the Haj subsidy began in 2012 with a Supreme Court ruling
 upie sarkaar ne is charanbaddh tareeke se khatm karne kii shuruyaat kii thi or ab modi sarkaar ne ek jatke main ise puri tarah khatm kar diya he
 People of the Muslim community have been demanding this for a long time
 jaaniye kya tha iske peeche tark or kya tha haj sabsidi kaa desh main itihaas
 Such was the beginning of Haj subsidy that after independence, Haj pilgrims used to go by the ships of Mughal Shipping Company of Mumbai till 1954
 lekin 1954 main hawaii maarg se haj yatra shuru hua
 But even now a large number of passengers used to go by sea route
 1960 ke dashak main khadi yuddh, uske baad tel niryaatak deshon ke sanghathan OPEC ke banane ke baad eendhan kaa kharch badha or 1973 main haj yatriyon ko lekar ja rahe ek jahaaj ke haadase ke baad 1973 main sarkaar ne faisla kiya ki ab haj yatri sirf hawaii maarg se hi jaaenge
 Indira Gandhi's government introduced a subsidy on air travel to relieve the extra expenditure on zerines due to halt on ship journeys
 kinako milti thi sabsididuniya ke musalamaanon kii tarah bharat ke musalmaan bhi saudi arab haj ke liye jate hai
 The government used to bear some part of the travel expenses of Indian Hajis as subsidies
 ye sabsidi unheen haj yatriyon ko milti thi, jo haj cameti ke jariye jate the
 These subsidies were not available to private travel passengers
 modi sarkaar ne mangalavar ko haj sabsidi kaa ye hissaa bhi puri tarah se samaapt kar diya
 Now the Haj pilgrimage will be entirely at the expense of the Zionists
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ne sabsidi khatm nahin kiya tha1998 se 2004 tak atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi
 During this time the Parliamentary Committee had recommended the abolition of Haj subsidy but despite this the government did not stop it
 2004 main congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani
 It is to be noted that since 2006, the Ministry of External Affairs and a Parliamentary Committee on Transport and Tourism had suggested the elimination of Haj subsidy within a time limit
 iske baavjood sarkaar ne haj sabsidi ko khatm nahin kiya
 To abolish the Haj subsidy, tell PIL that BN Shukla and former BJP Rajya Sabha member Prafulla Goradia filed PIL in the Supreme Court, urging the Indian government to abolish the Haj subsidy given in the International Yatra as unconstitutional
 Was
 surpim court ne kaha- haj sabsidi 10 saal main khatm hohaj sabsidi ke sandarbh main ucchtam nyaayalay ne 8 may 2012 ko sarkaar ne aadesh diye ki haj sabsidi ko band kiya jaae
 In 2012, the court ordered it to be scrapped gradually within a 10-year deadline
 iske baad se lagaataar sarkaar se milane vaali sabsidi main katautee hui
 Money that was released by the government before 2012
 wo saal dar saal ghatata gaya
 836 in 2012 according to the Ministry of Minority Welfare
 55 karod rupee kii haj sabsidi di gai
 Since then, the burden of subsidy has been reduced from the head of the government
 agle hi saal yani 2013 main centre sarkaar ne isamen dedh sau karod se zyada kii katautee karte hue 680
 03 crore subsidy released
 2017 main haj sabsidi par mahaj 250 karod2014 main is raashi main se bhi 100 karod se zyada rakam gata di gai or sabsidi 577
 07 crores remained
 2015 main sabsidi main kareeb 50 karod kii kami ai
 Now this amount is reduced to 529
 51 karod rupee ho gai
 In 2016, the government gave Rs 405 crore as Haj subsidy, which means the subsidy amount has come down from 836 to almost half
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik 2017 main mahaj 250 karod kii haj sabsidi di gai or ab 2018 main haj sabsidi ko modi sarkaar ne puri tarah se khatm kar diya he
 The government has decided to end the Haj subsidy even if the government has increased continuously
 baavjood iske beete kuch saal se jairinon kii sankhya main badhotaree hi hui he
 In 1996, where 75346 Haj pilgrims went to Mecca, this figure increased to 113909 in the year 2000
 saal 2012 main yehaj yatriyon kii sankhya badhkar 169961 ho gai, lekin 2013 main ye ghatakar 135938 ho gai
 These quotas have been decreasing on the basis of relations with Saudi Arabia
 lekin modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad dhire-dhire ye phir se yatriyon kii sankhya main ijapha hua
 The number of Haj pilgrims increased from 135966 in the year 2014 to 169940 in 2017
 is saal bharat se bina sabsidi ke hi 175000 jaayrine haz par jaayenge
 Apart from this, 1300 women Haj pilgrims had applied to go alone this time (without family or husband) for Haj which has been approved

 @explorawatersportsa post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) onjul 21, 2017 at 12:57 pm PDT Let us know that recently, Katrina and Ranbir Kapoor's film 'jagga Jasoos' has been released which is getting mixed response from the people
 'tiger jinda he' ali abbaas jafar dwaara nirdeshit saal 2012 main ai film 'ek tha tiger' kaa sikval he
 In this film, Salman played the role of a RAW agent while Katrina became a Pakistani agent
 relationships tuutane ke baad pehali baar ek saath aae ranbir-katrina, jab actress ne poocha- tu pi ke aayaa he? The process of development in Bihar came to a standstill after the death of the then Chief Minister Shri Krishna Singh in 1961
 bihar ke shunya vikaas ke liye ham keval lalu prasad yadav ko jimmedaar nahin tehra sakate
 Of course he contributed to this and moved Bihar towards negativity
 darasal, 1990 main jab unhone rajya kii satta sanbhali, uske bahut pehle hi vahaan vikaas shashan kii praathamikta main nahin rah gaya tha
 However, Lalu destroyed the working system while ensuring the end of the rule
 assi ke dashak main bihar main chah mukhyamantri hue
 They all remained concerned about the stability of their government
 vikaas unke dimag main tha hi nahin
 The JD (U) -BJP coalition government led by Nitish Kumar in November 2005 was the first government in more than four decades with top priority: governance and development
 hamen shuru main bahut pareshaaniyaan huin, kyonki tab rajya main shaayad hi koi tantra kaam kar rahaa tha
 We started by restoring the rule of law in Bihar and brought the state back to positive development, whether in real or symbolic form
 isse mahilaon or vyapaariyon ke liye suraksha kaa maahaul bana
 Both these classes were traditionally victims of inferiority laws
 2010 kaa janadesh hamaare prayaason or matadaataaon ke sankalp kii manjuuri kaa pratik he
 But we do not want to have any happiness
 sarkaar se ummiden bahut zyada hai
 We know that the pace of expectations sometimes exceeds the growth figures
 isliye logon ke asantosh kii ashanka kaa bhi hamen khyaal he
 We have accepted the challenges
 hamen kya karnaa he, yah spasht he
 After making Bihar a dynamic state, now it has to start giving positive results while reaching the next level of governance
 mukhyamantri mahoday ne pehle hi 2015 tak bihar ko viksit rajya banane kaa lakshya tay kar diya he
 Bihar has always been a land of revolutions
 1967 main krongress ke khilaaf pehle vidroh kii shuruyaat se-jisase rajya main (kuch duusare rajyon ke saath) pehali gaiyrcongressi sarkaar bani- 1974 ke jepi andolan tak, jisane indira gandhi kii sarkaar palat di thi, bihar ne kai sakaaratmak badlaavon ko disha di he
 i consider the success of the NDA government to be a similarly successful but silent revolution
 2010 ke janadesh ko nirnaayak saamaajik ghatakon kii shinaakht ke taur par bhi dekhnaa chahie
 In the alliance formed by some castes, Lalu had more dominance in some castes
 vaise main, aashcharya nahin ki kai saamaajik samoohon ko haashiye par dhakele jane kaa ehsaas hota tha
 In the beginning, the Congress also had a similar social alliance, which resulted in many people falling out of it
 hamaari safalataa darasal vaise saamaajik samoohon ko milakar ek indradhanushi gathbandhan banane main nihit he, jinhen paraspar virdohi mana jaataa tha
 We could broaden our social base, because our work raised expectations
 hamane mahilaon or atyant pichhadi jatiyon ko shashakt karne kaa kaam kiya, jo vikaas kii daud main kahin peeche chhot gaye the
 Our policy of taking everyone along changed the nature of politics
 haalanki ise lagu karnaa mushkil tha, lekin hamaari sanjidagi or dridhtaa safal hui
 No group left
 in sabakaa chunavi asar ab dikh rahaa haih shashaktikaran kii raajnneeti ne bihar kii mahilaon ko apni ek swatantra pahchaan di he
 This mandate also has a clear national message
 bhaavnaatmak ubhaar kii raajnneeti kaa daur ab khatm ho chukaa he
 Now people want something concrete
 sabko saath lekar chalane vaali bihar kii raajnneeti kaa model hi shaayad ab akelaa vyaavhaarik rajnatik vikalp he
 The new generation of voters has seen how other states are developing
 iske alaava aaj logon kii pahunch internet or un duusare soochna media tak he, jo bataate hai ki duniya bhar main kya ho rahaa he
 This generation is not satisfied only with emotional outcries
 janadesh isaki pushti karata he ki matadaata aisi sarkaar kaa hi samarthan karne ke liye taiyaar hai, jo kaam karti he
 If the government ensures inclusive growth, the government will not have the effect of protest
 bihar ke logon ne hamen dobaaraa satta saunpi, kyonki ve jaanate hai ki ham jo kehete hai vah karte hai
 This victory also has special meaning for our alliance
 rajg bahut khush he, kyonki is jeet ne nishchit taur par uski chhavi or vyapak kar di he
 This victory comes at a time when the Congress is struggling with its stain of corruption
 jis vyapaktaa se hamen muslim vot mili, usase bhaajapa or rajg ke bare main aam dharna badal gai he
 This can create a new electoral equation for our alliance
 jinhone secularism ke naam par hamaara saath chhod diya tha, unhen ab apana vah tark galat lagegaa
 Those who left us in the past can also return now
 (modi bihar ke up-mukhyamantri hai) Former Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju has once again made sharp comments about the collegium system of judges, through his blog
 katju ne likhaa he ki colegium vyavastha apaardarshee vyavastha he or iske jariye kai bhrasht jajon kii niyukti kii gai he, is vyavastha main turant hi parivartan laayaa janaa chahie
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Justis Katjuen has raised many questions
 katju ne kaha ki justise chelmeshwar ne baithak main naa jane ki vajah bataai he ki colegium kii meeting apaardarshee hoti he, keval paanch log chupake se baithkar faisle lete hai
 'you scratch my back, i will scratch your back', Justice Katju has said that the give and take formula runs inside this system, that is, you do my work, i will help you
 yahaan bargening hoti he, aap meraa fevar kiijie, main aapkaa karuunga
 'many corrupt and noxious judges were elected' Katju said, 'good judges cannot come from this system
 issystemne bahut saare bhrasht or ayogy jajon ko chunaa he
 a Doodle Judge from Kerala was elected through the collegium, despite opposition
 ''apane rishtedaaron ko chun lete hai jaj'yahi nahin katju aage bole ki kai jaj to apane rishtedaaron ko hi jaj chun lete he
 There have been many such cases when judges are chosen over their relatives and many qualified people are put behind
