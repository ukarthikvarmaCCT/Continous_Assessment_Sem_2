 Only a few days are left for the fatherhood to end
 aise main agar aap videsh main hai or kaamkaaj main vyast hone ke kaaran shraadh nahin kara paae hai to chintaa naa karen
 Because many websites are offering online pinddaan to pay obeisance to ancestors
 in websites ke jariye videsh main rah rahe bhartiya bhi pindadaan kar sakate hai
 In Internet era everything is available online
 yahaan tak ki shraadh or tarpan bhi
 An example of this was seen in Ujjain, where pundits are performing online shraddha and tarpan of people sitting in India and abroad
 yah sab video conferencing ke jariye hota he
 Apart from Jaipur, Udaipur and Delhi, people sitting in Nepal and America are also doing shraddha and offering of their ancestors in Ujjain
 kaise hota he online shraadhonline shraadh kii is prakriya main brahman apane yajmaan ke saath muhoort ke samay par scap, eggbi chat google dayu yaa kisi anya aplicoshan se conect hote hai
 The Muhurta is calculated according to the time of Ujjain
 yajmaan kii puja kii saamagree kii list pehle hi watsape yaa mail se bhej di jaati he
 At the appointed time, Yajman decorates the contents of the Puja in his house and sits down with a laptop in front of him, and on the other side, Panditji in Ujjain and then according to the Pandit, Yajaman worships
 online dakshina bhionline pindadaan karaane ke baad panditon ko online hi pement bhi mil jaataa he
 Many times, the pundits transfer to the Dakshina account before going to Shraddh
 bollywood industry main filmon kaa hit yaa flop hona actor ke haath main nahin hota he
 But choosing the right film is the hallmark of a good actor
 bollywood main kai actress aisi hai jo hit to hui hai, lekin sirf hit ectars ke saath
 Today we will talk about one such actress
 jinhen aapane bollywood ke bade sitaron ke saath kai hits dete dekha he, lekin solo main unki kahani zyada dur tak nahin gai
 Our point is towards Sonakshi Sinha
 sonakshi sinha ne bollywood ke superstar salmaan khan kii superhit film dabang ke saath apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The film released in 2010 was a super hit and Sonakshi Sinha was in the news overnight
 iske baad sonakshi sinha kaa kariyar graph lagaataar badhata gaya
 Sonakshi was seen in the film Rowdy Rathore opposite Bollywood player Akshay Kumar
 ye film bhi superhit hui
 Such a list is very long, whether you talk about the film Son of Sardar with Ajay Devgan
 ye sabhi filmein sonakshi se zyada lead actor ke sahare chali thim
 Sonakshi Sinha flopped in Solo? Now if we talk about Sonakshi Sinha's Solo then she has not been able to do anything amazing
 film khandaani shafakhana main sonakshi sinha lead actress thim
 Apart from him, the film also had the famous rapper Badshah and the film fell on the box office
 aisi list kaaphi lambii he, chahen film akira yaa happy phir bhaag jaaegi ho
 No film has done anything special
 sonakshi sinha film dabang 3 main bhi lead role main najar aaengi
 The film Dabangg 3 will be released on 20 December 2019
 ye dabang kaa teesraa part he or is hisaab se sonakshi dabang ke sabhi part main najar ai hai
 If you look at the trailer of Dabangg 3 and social media, then this film is also a hit
 sonakshi ke liye bhi film kaa hit hona jaruri he kyonki vah pichhali kai filmon se hit kaa intjaar kar rahi hai
 If that happens, Sonakshi's wait will finally end, but Sonakshi is yet to be hit in solo

 duusari taraf, bhartiya broadcasters kaa kahana he ki ve nepal ko bina vigyapanon ke saaf feed nahin de sakate
 Let me tell you, channels like Star Plus, Colors, GTV, Sony TV, Star Utsav are very popular in Nepal
 antertenment ke liye nepali darshak bhartiya shoj ko dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 Shows like Kulfi Kumar Bajewala, Yeh Rishta Kya Ke and The Kapil Sharma are very popular among the people of Nepal
 karina kapur khan ke bete taimur ali khan kii tasviren soshal media par chai rahati hai
 Many celebs have agreed that Taimur is more hit than them and now Taimur's grandmother Sharmila Tagore has also said that Taimur is more famous than him
 kolkata main india today se baat karte hue sharmila ne yah baat kahi
 She had come to participate in a program organized by the West Bengal government and the Kolkata Police
 karishma kii berthde party main chhaae taimur, mausi kii god main kar rahe mastitamur ke bare main poochne par sharmila ne media par kataaksh karte hue kaha kaha ki unki vajah se hi taimur star ban gaya he

 AAP leader Kapil Mishra claimed that Satyendra Jain will be the next 10-15 Will go to jail during the day
 lekin kapil mishra kii is bahucharchit pressvarta or sansanikhej aarope ke baad kuch sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The way Kapil Mishra has been attacking Sheela Dixit over the tanker scam, it was believed that he would reveal something about the tanker scam
 kapil mishra ne do din pehle hi asibi ko is mudde par chitthee likhakar daawa kiya tha ki unke haath is tanker ghotaale main nae tathy lage hai jinhen ve asibi se share karnaa chaahate hai
 It was only after this letter that Kapil Mishra was dismissed from his cabinet
 kapil mishra media se lagaataar kah rahe the ki wo karpshan karne waalon or unako bachaane waalon ko nahin chodenge
 Even before going to Rajghat on Sunday morning, Kapil Mishra claimed that some people associated with Arvind Kejriwal in Tanker Ghatale were named
 jinke bare main jaanakar kejariwal ke pairon se jameen khisak jaaegi
 Kejriwal has been accused of taking a soft stand on Sheila Dixit in the tanker scam
 isliye kapil mishra kii pressvarta main pahunche tamaam mediakarmi bhi tanker ghotaale main kisi nae khulaase kii ummid kar rahe the lekin kapil ne is bare main baat hi nahin kii or bilkul nayaa aarope kejariwal or satyendra jain par madh diya
 Kapil accuses Kejriwal and Satyendra of making a bribe of two crores but questions are being raised as to why he did not disclose the tanker scam? Even the allegations made by Kapil Mishra will be difficult for him to prove
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki unhone jis samay ye do karod rupee dekhe usee samay kyon nahin iskar vibhaag yaa duusari agenciyon ko phone kar kejariwal ko range haath pakadava diya? jis samay ye kathith len-dein ho rahaa tha kya us samay vahaan koi chauthaa vyakti bhi maujuud tha, jo isaki tasdik kar sake? kapil mishra se jab poocha gaya ki unhone kaise pataa kiya ki ye rakam do karod kii he to unhone kaha ki khud satyendra jain ne unhen bataaya yani jain ne unhen rakam kitni he ye to bataa diya lekin ye nahin bataaya ki ye kahaan se ai or kis kaam ke liye di gai
 Questions are also arising whether he was talking about what Kapil Mishra had revealed in the media for the last two days or did he change his strategy at the last minute? bharat sarkaar ne ab laal kile kaa theka daalamia group ko 25 karod rupye main 5 saal ke liye de diya he
 This means that now all the maintenance of the Red Fort has been handed over to a private company

 Opposition turned red when the Red Fort was handed over to private hands, the government clarified - On 22 December 2000, the Red Fort was attacked by terrorists of the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba
 - lashkar ke aatankiyon ne andhadhundh golia chalaai gai
 In which 3 jawans were killed
 - laal kile ko pehle 'kile-e-mubarak' ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 - It took almost 10 years to give shape and beauty to the Red Fort

 Because of this, this attempt also failed

 The factory will start on 22 acres of land, but as soon as the Modi government came to power, the expectations of Sushma Swaraj's parliamentary constituency were also once again green

 All technical things were decided

 bataa den ki pichley hafte big bos ne voting lines band kar di thi or mal main live voting ke jariye alimination kii prakriya puri hui thi
 Actually, all the four nominated contestants were taken to a mall in Mumbai
 vahaan contestants ko mal main maujuud logon se vot maangana tha
 x Boyfriend, who came in support of Shilpa, said- Love Tyagi is out of Humbig Boss 11, respecting her very much
 pichley hafte ghar se baahar jane ke liye hina khan, vikaas gupta, shilpa scindia or lav tyaagi nominated the
 Shilpa got the most votes
 unhen 660 vots, hina ko 446 vots, vikaas ko 428 vots or lav ko 393 vots mili
 All four counted their votes
 ajay choudhary or unke doston ne bijepi main narendra modi ke udai ko bahut utsaah ke saath dekha he
 Every morning after exercising at the RSS branch at Char Bagh near Safdarjung Airport, he has been discussing his thinking of Adarsh india after drinking tea for hours
 unki is soch kii pratidhwani modi ke bhaashanon main bataae ja rahe bharat ke swaroop main sunai detii he—ek aisa desh jisamen sabakaa vikaas ho or kisi kaa tushtikaran na ho
 In September 2013, when the BJP announced Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, this swarm of friends began to garner support for Modi as Prime Minister
 choudhary bataate hai, “ham 10 april ko dilli main voting se pehle hafton tak ghar-ghar jaakar modi kaa prachaar karte rahe
 i do not remember that since Advani ji contested in 1991, since then we have ever worked so hard for BJP
 is baar hamane modi ko vot diya he
 "chaudhary believes that if Modi becomes Prime Minister," the same code of conduct will apply and Hindu girls will not have to adopt Islam if they love Muslim boys
 ”yahaan se saikadon mile dur mumbai main duniya kii ek pramukh investment banking or management company ke bharat karyaalay ke varisht adhikari kaa kahana tha ki ab congress or bijepi kaarobaari duniya kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karatin, sirf modi karte hai
 In his opinion, Modi will bring changes in the economy, not the BJP in the eyes of the corporate world
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki videshi sansthagat niveshak is baat kii sambhaavna se utsahit hai ki modi bharat ke agle pradhanmantri or bijepi ke nivvaad netaa banenge
 Expectations have skyrocketed in both cases
 “bazaar un surveykshanon ko salaami de chukaa he, jinamein modi ke netritv main sarkaar banane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he or bazaar kii sthiti sudhari he
 But the corporate world also expects that Modi will start making visible changes till his government completes about three months on August 15 this year
 ”ek aadmi kii hui partibijepi main modi kaa bol-balabijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne party kaa modikaran karnaa shuru kar diya he
 a picture of Modi printed in full-page advertisements printed in newspapers on the day of polling in Delhi claimed, "your vote is a vote for me for the BJP candidate
" ” desh main 1971 ke baad se ek vyakti par kendrit chunaav nahin hua he
 The campaign was focused on Indira Gandhi in 1971, when she gave the slogan "garibi Hatao"
 is chunaav main modi kaa naaraa he—congress mukt bharat
 Modi's confidant and his party captain in Uttar Pradesh, Amit Shah, said, "the people of the country had made up their mind to choose Modi as Prime Minister even before the party was declared its formal candidate
" ”yah prachaar na sirf raashtrapati style main or vyaktitv kendrit he, balki is chunaav main modi kaa udai bijepi kaa vah rup bhi badal rahaa he, jo pichley 16 saal main endie or upie ke shasankaal main rahaa he
 The era after Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani has begun
 adhikansh rajyon or adhiktar pramukh padon ke liye modi ke apane vafaadaar tay kar liye gaye hai, jo bijepi kaa nayaa rup garh rahe hai
 Apart from Shah in Uttar Pradesh, Cabinet Minister Anandi Ben Patel in Gujarat, Dharmendra Pradhan, party general secretary in Odisha and Bihar and Muralidhar Rao in southern states are some of the key loyalists
 man hi man pradhanmantri pad kii laalasaa paalane vaale kuch netaaon ko chhodkar bijepi main adhiktar netaa modi ke peeche khadey hai
 Other leaders such as Modi's mentor Advani, former party president Murali Manohar Joshi and senior leader Jaswant Singh have also faced harsh remarks and expulsion (jaswant Singh)
 13 april ko joshi ne manorama news se kaha tha, “modi pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main party ke pratinidhi hai
 Therefore it is not a very personal but representative wave
 ve janata ke mood or badlaav kii ichha ke pratik hai
 "joshi was forced not only to clarify his statement the next day, but two days later when he started addressing the workers at a BJP event in Kanpur, Modi supporters were trying to stop him from speaking to every Modi, home The house started shouting Modi's slogans
 aakhirkaar joshi ko vahaan se janaa padaa
 Earlier, Joshi was uprooted from Varanasi to Kanpur so that Modi could contest from a seat in eastern Uttar Pradesh
 indira gandhi ne jis tarah congress main sarvashaktimaan sindicket ke par katare the
 Similarly, Modi has reduced the importance of those who have not become his hangers in this election
 isse pehle party ne kabhi ek aadmi ke saamne chupchaap is tarah ghutane nahin teke the
 LK Advani, the mentor of Narendra Modi and the real hero of Hindutva, has also been facing difficulties since the time he objected that the BJP was leaving a path of consensus for Modi
 may, 2013 main adwani goa main party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main shaamil nahin hue taaki party kii prachaar samiti ke pramukh ke pad par modi kii niyukti rukvaa saken
 In response, protesters gathered outside Advani's house on Prithviraj Road in Delhi raising slogans and protesters against him and there, along with party president Rajnath Singh in Goa, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley on this appointment from the Parliamentary Board Got their stamp unhone tark diya tha ki party netritv narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kii sanghathan kii maang ko zyada samay tak andekha nahin kar saktaa
 Unlike Advani, Rajnath managed to increase his strength in the new situation and his position in the party
 unhone khud ko party ke anushaasit sipaahi ke rup main pesh kiya
 That is why he is second after Modi
 pichley dinon hi party ne adwani ko apana nirvachan kshetra gujarat main gandhinagar se badalakar madhya pradesh main bhopal karne kaa faisla palatney ke liye baadhya kar diya
 Advani was angry that Modi and Rajnath were grabbing the seats of their choice, but pushing senior leaders like Joshi and Kalraj Mishra from their seats
 adwani ke vafaadaar harin pathak ko ahmedabad purv se tikat nahin diya gaya
 In 2009, Joshi and Advani had rejected Modi's objections on giving Pathak a ticket
 is baar party ke donon purv adhyaksh modi kii dayaa par nirbhar hai or ab apane nirvachan kshetra kaa faisla karne kii unki haisiyat bhi nahin rahi
 If the BJP defeated the Congress by a huge margin and the NDA government led by Modi came to power at the Center, then the changes in the BJP with the support of the RSS with the rise of Narendra Modi would be stoned
 nai vyavasthadilli se baahar pahunchaa satta kaa cendrabijepi ke bheetar modi kaa udai aisi kai bhitari ladaaiyon kii dein he, jinhone 2004 or 2009 main party ko congress ke liye gambhir chunauti nahin banane diya
 After the party's second consecutive defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the RSS took over the reins of the party embroiled in strife
 usne di4 kahalaane vaale dilli ke us gut kaa varchasv khatm kar diya, jisamen laalkrishna adwani ke khaas log arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, anant kumaar or em
 Venkaiah Naidu was involved
 aresas ne party netaaon ke sansadeey or sanghathan sambandhi kaaryon ko baant diya
 Sushma Swaraj became the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha
 In March 2009, Mohan Bhagwat, who became the new Sarsangh driver of the Sangh, placed his trusted Nitin Gadkari on the chair of the party president in December 2009
 nagpur ke kaarobaari or maharashtra ke purv mantri nitin gadakari kaa rajnatik kad haalanki chota tha, lekin bijepi kii lagaam kasne kaa aresas kaa yahi tarika tha
 In parallel to the rss moves, Modi was laying his trap
 ve sushasan ke gujarat model or rajya main bijepi kii safalataa se mache shor ke sahare dilli kii gaddi ke sapane dekhne lage
 Gadkari's tenure and personality faded and the search for workers as a strong symbol of Hindutva ended with Modi going
 janvari, 2013 tak gadakari apni companiyon ke bhrashtachar main ulajh gaye or unki jagah rajnath singh ne le lee, jo sangh kii duusari pasand the
 Narendra Modi won the third consecutive election in Gujarat and his eyes were set on Delhi
 adwani kii phir se party adhyaksh banane kii koshishon ko aresas se koi sahaara nahin mila, jisane 2005 main unhen hataaya tha
 The overwhelming support for Modi among activists forced the Sangh not only to accept his candidature, but also to strongly support him (see box)
 narendra modi bade-bade netaaon sahit party ke 12 sadasyon ke sansadeey board par baari padane lage or haal tak sabhi bade faisle unhone khud apane aap liye hai
 In the last few months, senior leaders like Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Joshi have protested how Modi has been imposing them on the board through Rajnath Singh without taking a consensus on his decisions
 virodh ke saarvajanik hone par uske nattejey bhi saamne aate rahe hai
 About 15 per cent of the candidates selected by the super-choice Modi Modi in this election have come from outside or other parties
 party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, “agar vastav main narendra modi kii koi lahar he, to inamen se bahut saare ummidavaaron ko jeet janaa chahie
 If this happens, the loyalty of a large part of the BJP parliamentary party will be directly to Modi, not to any other party leader or unit
 yah puraa chunaav modi par simat gaya he
 If this formula is successful, Modi will not have to face the same opposition as many big leaders have faced before him
 ” saat baar saansad rah chuke harin pathak ko modi ke chahete or film actor paresh rawal ke liye seat chhodmai padi
 Initially, Rawal protested in some places, but later this protest was suppressed and everything went quiet
 nai dilli main purv kendriya mantri ajay maakan ke khilaaf utaari gayi minakshi lekhi raajnneeti main apekshaakrit zyada janaa-pahachaanaa cheharaa nahin hai, lekin modi kii pakki vafaadaar hai
 If Modi's wave works, then he will get the reward of chanting Namo Namo in TV Studio's discussions every evening
 gujarat main bijepi ke 26 ummidavaaron main se ek tihaai se zyada congress se aae hai
 These include Devji Bhai Fatehpur, a former MLA from Surendra Nagar, and Prabhu Bhai Vaswa, a candidate from Porbandar, who had joined the BJP a month before he was resigned from the legislature
 uttar pradesh main bijepi ne baba ramdev ke chaar ummidavaaron sahit do darjan se adhik bahari netaaon ko tikat diya he
 The current mps from Dumriaganj (jagdambika Pal of Congress) and Gonda (kirti Vardhan Singh of Samajwadi Party) are contesting on BJP ticket
 gajiabad main purv thal sena adhyaksh ve
 K
 singh or padosi bagpat se mumbai ke purv police pramukh satyapal singh bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 In all these places, the old leaders of BJP and this time the people who are aspiring to be candidates in the elections are not very happy, although they are not publicly disclosing this
 unhen is baat kaa ehsaas he ki modi kii ranneeti kaaphi had tak safal rahati he or agar party satta main ai to antat unhen bhi laabh hoga
 Modi has started the process of making BJP less cumbersome and cunning, with the support of BJP workers and the hand of RSS on the back
 yah nai bijepi 2014 ke chunaav main 11 ashok road par kam nirbhar he
 RSS headquarters Nagpur became important at the time of Nitin Gadkari's appointment as the party president and Gandhinagar got a bigger edge last year
 modi ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane se pehle hi unke vafaadaar amit shah ko party kaa rajya prabharee mahasachiv banaakar uttar pradesh bhej diya gaya tha
 Here, Modi has been busy selling the Gujarat model of development for the country and presenting it in new ways
 udhar, shah chunaav ke hytech management kaa gujarat model uttar pradesh le aae
 He played a key role in the selection of candidates in the state
 yahi nahin, party kaa prachaar abhiyaan bhi bahut karine se taiyaar kiya or saarvajanik bhaashan dene kii bajaae ilaake ke pramukh logon se milakar baat karne par dhyaan diya
 This led to a direct contact with the local people, while this method was more effective because the local leaders convey their message to the bottom
 aresas ne shah kii madad karne or saare oparation par najar rakhane ke liye apane do vishwaston akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ke purv sanghathan sachiv sunil bansal or sangh ke sanyukt mahasachiv krishna gopal ko tainaat kar diya
 In 2009, BJP won 10 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 is baar is team kaa lakshya 50 siten jeetna he
 Results of UP become very important from this point of view
 gujarat kaa doosraa modesahmati kaa sikudta daayramodi ke udai ke saath aise yug kaa bhi sutarapaat hua he, jo rajnatik takat badhaane ke liye technology or management takneekon kaa bakhubi istemaal karata he
 Yet the uneasiness is also very much due to the rise of Modi within the BJP
 uske kaaran samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 There is no room for disagreement in Modi's politics
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, “gujarat kaa ek or model he, jisase sab darate hai
 Narendra Modi ended the political journey of former Chief Ministers Keshubhai Patel, Suresh Mehta and many other leaders
 ” modi ne 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav main rajya ke purv grih mantri haren pandya ko tikat na dekar rajya main sangh ke saath bhi do-do haath kiye
 He was also repeatedly confronted by his colleague Sanjay Joshi at one time, and later on to be a crook, and was finally forced to resign from the bjp's national executive in 2012
 1995 main gujarat main pehali baar bijepi kii sarkaar bani or keshubhai patel mukhyamantri bane
 Modi was then the national secretary of the BJP
 unhen 1987 main joshi ke saath party main bheja gaya tha or unhone gujarat main dabadabaa bana liya tha
 Shankar Singh Vaghela objected to Modi's domination in the Patel government and divided the party
 1998 main patel jab dobaaraa mukhyamantri bane, to adwani se kahkar modi ko sanghathan mahasachiv banaakar dilli bhijwa diya, lekin khud joshi gujarat main hi rahe
 Modi never forgave Patel and Joshi for being expelled from Gujarat
 patel ke kaarykaal main vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ke kaaryakari adhyaksh or sangh ke pratinidhi praveen togdipha bhi bahut taqatvar the
 When Modi returned to Gujarat as chief minister in 2001, Togadia supported the BJP in the 2002 election
 modi ke duusare kaarykaal main rajya main viechpi or bijepi ke raste alag ho gaye
 The VHP wanted to emphasize the agenda of Hindutva in the state and Modi wanted to pursue the path of development
 is tarah unhone togdipha ko na sirf nazarandaaj kiya balki rajya kii raajnneeti main unhen gaun bana diya
 Sanjay Joshi's soaring career graph suddenly came to a halt when a sex CD surfaced in 2005, just before the BJP national executive meeting in Mumbai, which Joshi was allegedly involved in
 nitin gadakari party adhyaksh bane, joshi kii vaapasi hui or ve uttar pradesh main kaam karne lage
 But in May 2012, Modi threatened to boycott the entire Gujarat unit of the BJP
 sanjay joshi ko rashtriya kaaryakarini chhodmai padi
 Modi does not forgive easily nor forget anything
 ve anushaasanheenata bhi bardaasht nahin karte
 In July 2010, student leaders were caught after the Gujarat University vice-chancellor stormed into the house during the ABVP agitation to protest the increase in fees
 kehete hai ki us samay modi ne sangh se madad lee or 15 din main maangon par karrwai karne ke vaade par andolan khatm kara diya
 But the demands were never met
 iske vipareet modi ne jis tarah gujarat ko chalaaya, usamen bharat ke liye unki aarthik drushti kii jhalak mil sakati he
 Despite the party's claim that the food security program of the party's government in Chhattisgarh is better than the upa's program, Modi is against sharing the bailout
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki unke model main sarkaar nivesh main sahaayak ke taur par kaam karegi or nijee udhyam ko adhik badhaava diya jayega
 The party has changed its stance on FDI in retail and played acrobatics during the tenure of the UPA government
 lekin aisa lagata he ki modi bazaar se zyada sanchalit honge or sudhaaron par dhyaan denge, jisase bijepi kii aarthik drushti phir dakshinpanthi ho jaaegi, jaise england main margrat thatcher ne conservative party ke saath kiya tha
 The basic beliefs of the Sangh will surely become a headache for the NDA under Modi's leadership
 agar bijepi ko sarkaar banane or chalaane ke liye kam sahyogiyon kii jarurat padi, to aresas apane agenda ko lagu karne ke liye jabardast dabaav daalega, jisamen itihaas kii kitabon main pherbadal se lekar anuchhed-370 khatm karnaa or samaan aachaar samhita lagu karnaa shaamil he
 But Modi can take a different approach from the Sangh in this matter
 ve sushasan or vikaas ke apane agenda ko aage badhayenge
 The change Modi is dreaming of may attract millions of people feeling cheated by the upa's policy drudgery, but will not be able to woo the army of volunteers who elect them with the resolve of indigenous and simple life Are promoting agar gujarat main sangh parivaar kaa taaja itihaas koi pramaan he, to ho saktaa he ki sangh ko jald hi apana maang patr badalanaa pade
 Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav announced 325 candidates for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections, the storm in the family has once again arisen
 shivpal ke chaheton kii is list main bharmaar he
 While Akhilesh's close friends have not found a place
 tikat bantwaare se naaraaz siem akhilesh ne chachaa shivpal ke do karibiyon sandip shukla or surabhi shukla se rajyamantri kaa darja chin liya he
 Sandeep Shukla was working as an advisor in the government while his wife Surabhi was the vice chairman of the Housing Development Council
 siem akhilesh ne tikat naa paane vaale vidhayakon, mantriyon kii guuruuvaar ko baithak bhi bulaai he
 Mulayam Singh earlier said that 176 sitting mlas have been given tickets
 baaki 78 naamon kii ghoshnaa jald kii jaaegi
 During this, he said that the one who wins UP wins Delhi
 ye chunaav 28 farvari se hoga
 Mulayam's daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav will contest from Lucknow Cantt
 party pramukh ne kaha ki sabhi ummidavaaron ko soch-samajhakar chunaa gaya he
 However, Shivpal's dominance is more visible in the candidates who have been given tickets
 ayodhya skikhilesh cabinetmen mantri or unke kareebi pawan pandey ko tikat nahin mila he
 He had been in the news for pushing Ashu Malik
 benny prasad verma ke bete rakesh verma ko barabanki se tikat mila he
 Arvind Singh also did not get the ticket, he is an MLA from Barabanki, is also close to Akhilesh
 ramgovind choudhary ko bhi tikat nahin diya gaya
 Atik Ahmed, who directly challenged the Chief Minister, also got the ticket and Mukhtar Ansari's brother also got the ticket
 jin mantriyon ko akhilesh yadav ne shivpal yadav camp kaa maanakar mantrimandal se baahar kar diya tha wo sabhi log tikat paane main kaamyaab rahe
 Om Prakash Singh, Narada Rai, Ambika Chaudhary, Shadab Fatima, Shiv Kumar Beria, Rajkishore Singh, Aridaman Singh, Rajkishore Singh and Yogesh Pratap Singh have all got tickets
 sitapur ke vidhayak rampal yadav ko gundgardee ke aarope main akhilesh yadav ne party kaa pradesh adhyaksh rahete party se hi nikaal diya tha
 Shivpal Yadav gave him a ticket two days ago by bringing him back to the party
 tikat ke bantwaare main apane logon kii andekhi hone par akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki jin logon ko unke kehane par tikat nahin mila he unke bare main wo mulaayam singh yadav ko punarvichaar karne ko kahenge
 But it is so clear that uncle nephew's fight once again for ticket distribution has come to the fore
 dekhnaa he ki ab akhilesh apane logon ko kya ishaara karte hai
 Ram Govind Chaudhary, Arvind Singh Gop and Pawan Pandey went to meet Akhilesh, all three did not get tickets
 kahin se bhi chunaav lard sakate hai akhileshmukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne khud saarvajanik manch ne kaha tha ki vah bundelkhand kii kisi seat se chunaav ladanaa chahenge
 But Akhilesh Yadav is not named in the seats announced
 akhilesh yadav ke chunaav ladane ke bare main puche jane par mulaayam singh yadav ne sirf itnaa hi kaha ki vah jahaan se chaahe chunaav lard sakate hai
 In recent times, there has been a clear tussle between the Chief Minister of the state Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav's brother Shivpal Yadav over the seat sharing
 akhilesh ne apane pasandida ummidavaaron kii list mulaayam ko saunpi thi, jis par shivpal ne naaraazgi jataai thi
 On this, the party supremo said that everyone has sent the list according to their own
 jitna sambhav ho sakaa he, maine edjust karne kii koshish kii he, lekin final suchi meri pasand kii he

 shrinkhalaa ke chaar maichon main nau wicket le chuke vinay ne kaha, ‘main har match main 10 ran kam de saktaa tha
 There are some areas in which i can improve further

 i know that you can also throw a ball that does not get a run
 yah bhi jaanata hum ki main ballebal ko niyantrit kar saktaa hum
 In such a situation, i believe that i could have shown more consistency and given 10 runs less in every match
 ’pichley maheene perth se apane test kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaale vinay ne kaha ki gharelu cricket or antarrashtriya cricket main bahut fark he
 Vinay said, 'there is little scope for mistake
 agar aap ek yaa do genden kharaab bhi phenkate hai to bhi gharelu cricket main bane rah sakate hai
 In international cricket, good balls also have fours and bad balls have to be hit
 aise main yahaan aapako adhik lay main rahane kii jarurat he
 Vinay said that the team's explosive batsman Virender Sehwag is improving through treatment and any decision on his inclusion in the team will be made before the match against Australia on Sunday
 ajay devgan or kaajol kii beti nyasa vakt ke saath badi ho rahi he
 11-year-old Nyasa is very active on social networking site Facebook these days

 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani rajd pramukh lalu prasad tathaa sapa pramukh mulaayam singh ke naatakeey loksabhaa satr chalaane kii koshish main shaamil hone vaale party ke kuch saansadon se khush nahin hai or iske liye gopinath munde ko fatkaar bhi padi he
 Advani is not happy with Munde, Kirti Azad, Maneka Gandhi and his son Varun and other BJP mps who joined Prasad and Yadav's effort to run a mock parliament on Friday as the party is bitterly opposed to the RJD and SP on many issues
 bhaajapa sutron ne kaha ki is tarah naatakeey satr chalaanaa sansad kaa apmaan he or is tarah kii koshish main shaamil hona mukhya vipakshi dal ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 Advani has reprimanded Munde, the deputy leader of the BJP in the Lok Sabha, as he agreed to Prasad for a dramatic session
 is dikhaave main munde main jahaan loksabhaa adhyaksh bane, vahiin aaazaad vipaksh ke netaa ban gayi
 Munde is said to have tried to tell Advani that his party colleagues had not favored Prasad and Yadav during the session on the issue of salary hike, but merely a sound vote without discussing the Medical Council of India (amendment) Bill
 Had objected to the way it was passed by
 baharhaal, adwani is daleel se raji nahin hue or unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke kisi bhi saansad ko is tarah ke naatakeey satr main bhaag nahin lenaa tha
 The platform to protest or raise any issue is the actual Parliament

Sanjay Singh said that Nitish Kumar is a big national leader of the country and he deserves that he gets the facility as per protocol everywhere

 priyanka kii raajnneeti main entry par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki priyanka ke uttar pradesh main aane se yahaan kii raajnneeti main bada badlaav aayega
 It is believed that she can contest from her mother Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary seat Rae Bareli
 priyanka gandhi ke loksabhaa chunaav ladane par rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ye faisla puri tarah se priyanka par hi nirbhar karegaa
 But we will fight in this Lok Sabha election not on the backfoot but on the frontfoot

 Gulzar brought the 'shyam Rang Ka Jadoo' to the film world which is set on 'gore Rang Ke Guman'
 
 
 geetkaar ke taur par apni pehali hi film 'bandini' main 'mora gora rang lai le, mohe shyaam rang dai de
 
 
 'this lyricist who is writing has turned 80 today
 
 
 yah sochakar isliye bhi hairat hoti he ki is umr main bhi gulzaar ke geeton main naujavaanon ko maat karata nashilaapan he, nae jamaane ko peeche chhodti bebaaki he or apane liye nai manzilen hasil karne kaa hunar he
 
 
 The truth is that Gulzar came across as someone who knew that silence also spoke in Mumbai movies, which kept crying and laughing out loud, every emotion, to extreme heights
 More trouble than running tears produces pearls stuck on the eyelids, more afflictions than ruffles are sorrows hidden behind the lips
 
 
 darasal, gulzaar ne hindi filmon ko kam bolkar zyada kehane kaa salika diya
 
 
 In the world where every film is based on the business of love, songs of love are sung step by step, Ishq is proclaimed, there is a waving voice - 'pyaar koi boli no pyaar, pyaar no khoya, There is a silence, hears it, says it
 
 
 ' This gulp of love that has illuminated civilizations for centuries, like the drop of Noor, when Gulzar ceased, the game of burning the parishioners was left behind and people saw it making shadows in the sea, splashing the pans and coming on the waves
 , Who is not very beautiful, but is very charming in his innocent ways
 
 
 gulzaar aae to apane saath nai kala laae or rishton kii nai gaharaai bhi
 
 
 In his songs, the moon comes wearing different kinds of attire, Naina deserts the dream and tells that the more you see, the more you will suffer
 
 
 unke yahaan mohabbat sirf jismani nahin rah jaati, ruhani ho uthati he
 
 
 In his songs, time appears as a sad hero
 
 
 barason baad achaanak mil gaye kisi khoe hue jode ko unke ateet ke dinon main lautaata hua, jahaan 'fursat ke raat-din' hai or 'mohabbat kaa halkaa-halkaa taap' he, lekin sabase zyada vah pukaar he, jo baahar nahin, bheetar utarati he
 
 
 She does not leave, always stays together
 
 
 yaad dilaati he ki khud ko pahchaanane ke liye dusron ko pahchaanana bhi zaruri hota he or ham jo banate hai, usamen ek-duusare ko samajhane kii, mahasoos karne kii kuch khamosh koshishon kaa bhi haath hota he

 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke baad 2019 main bhi congress ko sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The Congress party led by Rahul Gandhi contested 421 seats out of the total 543 Lok Sabha seats, but lost 369 seats
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke baad jis tarah rahul ne mandiron main janaa shuru kiya, usase kayaas lagane jane lage the ki congress soft hindutv ke model par waapas laut rahi he
 In such a situation, now that all the results of the election results are in front, let's take a look at the graph of the Congress
 congress ne is baar 421 siton par chunaav ladaa, jisamen sirf 52 siton par use jeet mili
 The Congress stood second in 196 seats and third or even lower in 173 seats
 congress ke kul 52 saansadon main se 60 fisadi to sirf teen rajyon se hi aate hai, jo kerala, tamilnadu or punjab hai
 That is, all three are non-hindi states
 ek taraf bhaajapa 17 rajyon main 50 fisadi se adhik vot share laane main safal rahi to vahiin congress sirf pudducheri main aisa karnama kar pai
 56 to Congress Party here
 3 fisadi vot mila
 In which states Congress got respectable votes - Congress has got more than 40 percent vote in only seven states
 inamen meghalaya (48
 3), Nagaland (48
 1), lakshadweep (46
 9), andaman-nicobar (46), Goa (42
 9), chandigarh (40
 9) and Punjab (40
 1) shaamil hai
 - In Kerala where Congress has won the most 15 seats, it has only 37 seats
 3 fisadi vot mila he
 35 in Assam where the party has got three seats
 4 fisadi vot mila
 What do the figures say? - non-hindu voters are the highest in eight states where Congress has got respectable votes
 - meghalaya, nagaland main congress ko sabase zyada vot mila, yahaan 90 fisadi voter isai hai
 - Around 95% of the voters in Lakshadweep are from Muslim community
 - goa kii jis seat par congress jiti he vahaan par isai or muslimon kii sankhya zyada he to vahiin jahaan bijepi jiti he vahaan par 76 fisadi hindu aabaadi he
 Similar trends are seen in these states like Punjab, Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar
 fail rahaa soft hindutv kaa daanv?bataa den ki gujarat chunaav ke dauraan shuru hua mandiron main jane kaa silsilaa is baar loksabhaa chunaav tak chalaa
 Be it Congress President Rahul Gandhi or General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, both of them exposed the image of temple-temple forehead and soft Hindutva throughout the campaign

 On November 22, along the Line of Control in Machil sector of Kupwara district, the army has received a night vision device carrying the stamp of 'US government property' in the case of mutilating the body of a jawan
 isse machhil kii ghatana main pakistani sena ke shaamil hone kaa spasht sanket miltaa he
 It is noteworthy that on 22 November, a contingent patrolling the Machil sector was ambushed by intruders in which three soldiers were killed and the body of one of the soldiers Prabhu Singh was mutilated
 bhartiya sena ke varisht adhikariyon ne enditivi ko bataaya ki is nite vijan divaais ko america sarkaar dwaara afghanistan seemaa par aatankwaadiyon se muqabla karne ke liye paak sena ko muhaiyaa karaae jane kii sambhaavna he
 Some of these devices are believed to have been given to members of the Pakistan Border Action Team who carried out the November 22 incident
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab 'america sarkari sampatti' kii muhar lage divaais kashmir main aatankwaad virdohi oparation ke dauraan baraamad hue hai
 An officer posted last year in Machil sector told NDTV that his team had also found similar devices when they killed 4 terrorists in an encounter
 nite vijan divaais ke alaava, aise kai sanket milte hai jinase pataa chalata he ki is hamale main pakistan kii 'sidhi bhoomika' thi
 a medical gauge recovered from Machil after the attack remains the mark of the "pakistan Defense Force", while drugs have the markings of Lahore, Karachi and Multan
 iske alaava samrik radio set, gola-barood, vir kattar, bhojan saamagree, doorabeen or sleeping bag baraamad hue hai
 Following a meeting of top commanders of the Indian and Pakistani Army, on 23 November, the Indian Army in its statement termed the case of 'mutilating' the bodies of an Indian jawan by terrorists near the Line of Control
 sena ke adhikariyon ne enditivi se baatcheet main bataaya ki isamen koi andeh nahin ki 'aatankwaadi' pakistan border ection team ke sadsy nahin the
 The Border Action Team consists of the dreaded Zehadi, retired commandos of the Pakistani Army and members of the Pakistan Army's Special Service Group Commandos who often give directions and specific targeted input regarding the operation to other members of the team
 udi hamale or bharat dwaara pakistan ke aatanki campon par sargical strike kiye jane ke baad, bharat or pakistan ke bich jari tanaav ke baavjood, donon deshon ke dijiemo (diarector general of military oparation) ke bich pichley saptaah hui baithak ke baad sangharshaviram ulanghan ko koi ghatana saamne nahin ai he
 Apart from the night vision device, there are several indications that Pakistan had a 'direct role' in this attack
 hamale ke baad machhil se baraamad hue ek medical gej main "pakistan raksha bal" kaa mark bana hua he jabaki dawaaon main lahore, karachi or multan kii marking mili he
 In addition, tactical radio sets, ammunition, wire cutters, food supplies, binoculars and sleeping bags have been recovered
 bharat or pakistani sena ke sheersh cmanderon ke hui baithak ke baad, 23 november ko bhartiya sena ne apane bayaan main niyantran rekha ke paas aatankiyon dwaara bhartiya jawan ke shav ko 'kshat-vikshat' karne ke maamle ko aniatik karrwai qaraar diya tha
 Army officials told NDTV that there was no doubt that the 'terrorists' were not members of the Pakistan Border Action Team
 border ection team main khoonkhaar zehadi, pakistani sena ke ritred commando or pakistani sena ke special sarvice group commando ke sadsy shaamil rahete hai jo aksar team ke anya sadasyon ko oparation ke sambandh main disha-nirdesh or vishesh lakshith input dete hai

 supreme court ne us yachika par sunwaayee karne se inkaar kar diya jisamen anusuchit jati or janajati ko die gaye aarakshan par vichaar karne or jo jatiyaan ubar chuki hai unhen cote se baahar karne kii maang kii gai thi
 The Supreme Court said that this case is not a violation of human rights so it cannot be heard
 is par yachikakarta ne apni yachika waapas le lee
 In fact, a petitioner named OP Shukla had filed a PIL in the Supreme Court, stating that the Lokur Committee had said in its report that the castes under the SAC-SST should be reviewed from time to time but governments did not do so
 yahi kaaran he ki kai jatiyaan lagaataar aarakshan kaa phayda uthaa rahi hai
 Some of the castes have also been cited in the petition and it has been said that many of these castes no longer need reservation
 lihaaza inhen cote se hataaya jaae or nai jatiyon ko is aarakshan cote main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 For this, the central government and all state governments were made party
 lekin, supreme court ne kaha ki wo is yachika par sunwaayee nahin karegaa
 The petitioner can withdraw this petition if he so desires
 is par yachika ko waapas le liya gaya
 Significantly, while canceling the reservation given to the Jat community in the OBC quota, the Supreme Court had said that the government was inducting new castes, but not excluding anyone

 sachin tendulkar ke sanyas ko lekar chal rahi charchaa ke bich purv bhartiya captain anil kumble ne team main is star ballebaaj kii jagah par sawaal uthaa rahe logon kii kadi aalochana kii
 He said that Tendulkar's feelings should be appreciated
 tendulkar lambey samay se kharaab form main chal rahe hai or kai logon ne bhartiya team main unke sthaan par sawaal khadey kiye hai, lekin kumble ne kaha ki yah samay un par anguli uthaane kaa nahin, balki samarthan karne kaa he
 Kumble wrote in his column in 'week' magazine, there were many occasions when he single-handedly won India, but he never remained the sole cause of India's defeat
 behatar yahi hoga ki unke saamne jo he, usase unhen khud nibatane den, kyonki koi unki jagah nahin le saktaa
 No one has played 192 Test matches so far, not scored 34 thousand runs or scored 100 centuries
 unhen vah sammaan den, jiske vah hakdaar hai
 The comments unhone likhaa he, pichley 23 saal main unhone logon ke sapane saakaar karne main madad kii
 Made him feel better emotionally
 ab hamen unki bhaawanaaon kii bhi kadra kerani chahie
 He said that not only Tendulkar, but the entire team is going through a bad phase and it would be completely wrong to say that this team is performing badly due to Tendulkar's poor form
 kumble ne kaha, pehali baar log team main unke sthaan par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 It is being said that he should retire, because his performance in the last year or recently has not been the same as it was in the previous 22 years
 haa hamane is daur main sachin kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan nahin dekha, lekin keval vah akele aise nahin rahe
 If you look at the whole picture, the team has struggled in Test cricket
 to kya ham yah maanate hai ki bharat ab bhi 'van main army' he or puri tarah se sachin par nirbhar he
 i agree that it is not so

 It would be better to let them deal with what is in front of them, because no one can take their place
 kisi ne ab tak 192 test match nahin khele hai, 34 hajaar ran nahin banaae hai yaa 100 shatak nahin lagaae hai
 Give him the respect he deserves

 unhone kaha ki keval tendulkar hi nahin, balki puri team bure daur se guzar rahi he tathaa yah kahana puri tarah galat hoga ki yah team tendulkar kii kharaab form ke kaaran bura pradarshan kar rahi he
 Kumble said, for the first time people are questioning his place in the team
 kaha ja rahaa he ki unhen sanyas le lenaa chahie, kyonki pichley saal yaa haal main unka pradarshan vaisaa nahin rahaa jaisaa ki usase pehle ke 22 varshon main tha
 Yes, we did not see Sachin's best performance in this period, but he was not the only one

 seshanh kaise likhi apni pehali kitabspikarh amish treepathipatrakaron ke saath intervyuu chal rahaa tha
 One girl said that you are very inspiring
 main sunakar kuch ghabara sa gaya
 i said hey what have i done so that i can inspire someone
 usne kaha ki main apane job, apane bos se nafrat karti thi
 Salary seemed low
 phir uske haath shiva tryolji lagi or use laga ki sab kuch khatm nahin hua he
 Then she decided that she too would quit her job and write a book
 Mind rocks: dallalon ko vidhansabha nahin jane duungaa: kejarivalmujhe laga ki agar likhe kaa itnaa asar he, to agar main abhi is ladki se kah duun ki jaao, istipha de do, jo chaaho wo karo, to ye kar degi
 But there was also responsibility
 to phir maine use ye bataanaa tay kiya ki maine lekhak banane kaa faisla kisi aaveg main nahin liya tha
 It is clear, but overnight i did not get success either
 aath saal lage is vakt ke liye sabase pehali mushkil thi ki kaise likhen
 Never before had anything written fiction
 college main maha ghatiya poetry likhata tha, jise tab meri garlfriend or ab wif sunati thi
 Mind rocks: i have not seen women rioting till date: Kiran Bedifir made fun of my friends when i decided to write a book
 unhen lagata tha ki main creativili chalenced hum, tab main bank kii naukari kar rahaa tha
 But my family supported
 dhyaan rahe ki pehali do kitabon ke likhe jane tak main naukari kar rahaa tha
 So it was very important
 to pehali samajhadaari ye he ki aapmen bilashak tallent hona jaruri he, magar uske saath chahie kadi mehnat or abhyaas
 There is no substitute for hard work
 or iskaa istemaal hota he lagaataar abhyaas main
 The second point is to believe in yourself
 self billief
 People ask me if you have a self bailiff
 agar kitabon ke bare main poocha jayega to haa, iskaa jawaab haa main he
 But do i have a self-philosophy on every front of life? to shaayad jawaab khojna pade
 When my first book was going to many publishers
 to sab riject kar rahe the
 Were saying that there is a lot of knowledge in this
 ekaadh thodaa bahut ruchi dikhaa rahe the
 But i was not ready for any change
 mere liye kitaab usamen likhaa hua, bahut nijee tha
 Everything was personal
 isliye maine is baat kii parvaah nahin ki log kitaab ke bare main immortels of meluha ke bare main kya kah rahe hai
 This made me believe that there should not be any fear of failure or failure
 jarurat apana andruni vishwaas paane kii, uske sanket samajhane kii he
 The last thing i want to say is optimism
 kuch hi log hai, jo chaandi kii chamachi ke saath paidaa hue hai
 Things are accessible to them
 magar ham zyaadaatar hindustaniyon ke liye chijen aasaan nahin he
 That just woke up one day and left everyone and started fulfilling the dream
 to jimmedaariyon se, rosemara kii chizon se bachane kii firaaq chhodie
 You can start chasing your dreams with your job and other things too
 apane riting ke shuruaati 6 saalon main maine teen kaam kiye
 Job done
 kitaab likhi or family ke saath vakt bitaayato apane saath kathor banie
 Have hope saamaanya rahakar bhi asaamaanya kaamon kii neenv rakhi ja sakati he
 Questions and answers with Amish: The question of spirituality, how to make your faith center
 jab itane karmkand hai?javabaimish kaa jawaab
 This is the right question, if the rituals are not understood, then why should they be done
 sawaal poochna galat nahin he
 Is not Indian
 aap bhagavad gita padhie
 Krishna tells Arjuna that my job is to give you knowledge
 magar tumhaare paas mastishk he, uskaa istemaal karo, gyaan kii vivechna karo or jo tumhen sahi lage, vah karo
 We play cricket agar outfield main practice kar rahe hote hai, to coach baar baar cheekhta he
 Don't move your head sar phixd rakho
 Why does he say that
 ritual sa kyon banataa he
 If he sits down and starts explaining how the ball swings when in the air, how it projects towards you
 to bahut vakt lag jaae, or us vakt ye calculation nahin ho sakati
 If the head is fixed, the eye will remain fixed and can follow the ball's trajectory properly
 pridict kar sakegi
 But this rule cannot be applied everywhere
 agar badminton main sir fiks rakhenge to haar jaaenge
 Because there are frequent shuttles coming in from new ways and routes
 to aapako apane karmkaandon ko dekhnaa hoga
 If you understand and give you strength then you have to choose
 doosraa sawalidesh main dharm kaa sawaal aapasi nafrat kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 And in politics it is used only with wrong intentions
 amish kaa javabalmain raajnneetik sawaalon par jawaab nahin detaa
 First, my understanding of politics is not very good
 khayr, agar dharm kii baat karen to ye sach he ki har dharm main kuch kattarpanthi hai
 But for most people, religion means peace and faith
 jarurat un logon ko apane yakeen ko sanchalit karne waalon par dhyaan dene kii he
 Question- What is your stand on idol worship? Amish's answer: When i was called, it was said that light is a fun session
 acha sawaal he
 If you search for answers in the Vedas, you will find the concept of God at four levels
 sabase upar he nirgun niraakaar ishwar
 He has no gender, no identity
 puraane vakt main ise brahman kehete the
 Do not confuse it with the cast
 ise ekam bhi kehete the
 It was considered the most supreme
 magar yah sabko samaj nahin aa paata tha
 So those who were not ready to understand the formless God
 unke liye form aae
 Like Shiva, Vishnu
 
 
 phir aayaa avatar kaa concept, jahaan human form main aae ishwar, jaise ram or krishna
 
 
 Then came the humans who reached the equivalent of God
 buddha, mahavir
 
 
 Only after winning the second Test match against Sri Lanka, Team India suffered a big setback
 bharat kaa yah star left arm spinner siries kaa teesraa or aakhri test match nahin khel paaegaa

 maidan par maujuud on field ampiron ne mana ki jadeja kaa vah thro ballebaaj ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa tha
 On-field umpires Bruce Oxenford and Rod Tucker submitted their reports to match referee Richie Richardson, after which Jadeja admitted his mistake
 is nilamban ke baad bhi jadeja ke khate main 6 dimerit point rahenge
 Further, if this number increases to 8 or more in 24 months, then it will be converted into four suspension points

 He took 5 wickets in Sri Lanka's follow-on innings
 jadeja ko unke is pradarshan ke liye 'main of da match' kaa aword diya gaya

 So you remember that Prime Minister Modi had to apologize to the government in the House for the way he linked Manmohan Singh and Hamid Ansari to Pakistan in the Gujarat elections

 Remind you all that BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha had a special relationship with the family of Pakistan President Ziaul Haq

 There is a report in 2012 that when the delegation of Indian mps visited Pakistan, Sinha also went to meet Ziaul Haq's daughter Zain Zia
 main yah misaal isliye nahin de rahaa ki sinha deshadrohi hai balki sinha ke deshprem par koi shaq kaise kar saktaa he
 But Sinha was given a ticket in 2014 by the BJP
 uske pehle bhi tikat diya or mantri banaaya
 Then no one told Sinha that you are a traitor or BJP wants to combine with Pakistan through Sinha
 sinha apane in sambandhon ko khulkar nibhaate rahe hai
 Has anyone from within BJP dared to call him an agent of Pakistan? ham kahaan se kahaan aa gaye hai

 ek kaam kijiega, rafel deal par aapke priy hindi akhbaar main jitani bhi khabaren chhapi hai un sabko ek jagah rakhkar phir se padhie
 Remind you all that BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha had a special relationship with the family of Pakistan President Ziaul Haq
 shatrughna sinha bijepi ke manch se kaha karte the ki jioul haq kii beti unki bahan he
 There is a report in 2012 that when the delegation of Indian mps visited Pakistan, Sinha also went to meet Ziaul Haq's daughter Zain Zia
 main yah misaal isliye nahin de rahaa ki sinha deshadrohi hai balki sinha ke deshprem par koi shaq kaise kar saktaa he
 But Sinha was given a ticket in 2014 by the BJP
 uske pehle bhi tikat diya or mantri banaaya
 Then no one told Sinha that you are a traitor or BJP wants to combine with Pakistan through Sinha
 sinha apane in sambandhon ko khulkar nibhaate rahe hai
 Has anyone from within BJP dared to call him an agent of Pakistan? ham kahaan se kahaan aa gaye hai
 The comments companiyon or cricket premiyon ko kuch fark nahin padataa ki hamaari raajnneeti pakistan ke bare main kya sochati he
 People wait when Pakistan will match
 jab bhi hota he ve match dekhte hai
 During the broadcast of India Pakistan match in Dubai, you must have seen how many companies advertisements
 bazaar hameshaa pakistan ke saath hone vaale match kaa laabh uthaata he
 Politics always wants to defend itself from Pakistan
 pakistan ko lekar bhaajapa netaaon ke kuch puraane bayanon ko yaad karte hai
 Therefore, the question arising on Rafael Deal should be answered
 pakistan kaa masalaa alag he or us par baat ho sakati he or us par raajnneeti bhi ho sakati he lekin rafel ko lekar pakistan kaa kya matlab he
 Is it not that Pakistan is being used to mislead the people
 yah landan se chhapane vaala akhbaar telegraph he
 In this, Dean Nelson has spoken to the officials of Pakistan
 kaaryvahak videsh mantri sarataaj azeez se baat kii thi
 And it was written in the title that Pakistan supports Narendra Modi as the next Prime Minister
 nawaz sharif kaa bayaan he ki modi jeetenge or ham ummid karte hai ki ek majboot sarkaar aegi jo baatcheet ke liye upyukt hogi
 If the Congress party holds a press conference about this newspaper that there is a lump in Pakistan and Modi, then you tell me whether the sophist will be shy or not
 kya congress ko tab yah kahana tha ki pakistan chahta he ki modi jeeten or kya tab koi news ankar is baat ko lekar dibet karata
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh has posted Imran Khan's speech on his Facebook
 haal main pakistan main chunaav hue the, jisamen ek raily main bolte hue imran khan ne pradhanmantri modi kii eemaandaaree kii tarif kii thi
 So whether there was any friendship between Imran Khan and Prime Minister Modi, can it be concluded on this basis
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad imran khan ne pradhanmantri modi ko patr bhi likhaa or jab neuyork main hone vaali baatcheet radd hui to abhadra tippanee bhi kii, jisaki sabane ninda kii
 Imran Khan came to Delhi in December 2017 and paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Modi
 kya is aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki imran khan or pradhanmantri modi kii dosti he
 a strategy is being formed
 bhopal main pradhanmantri modi ne pakistan kaa naam nahin liya lekin vahi baat kahi jo sambit paatra ne apane press conference main kahi thi
 Those who questioned earlier were made supporters of Pakistan
 soshal media par failaayaa gaya ki ye log pakistan kii madad kar rahe hai
 It is now being said that the Congress party is in alliance with Pakistan
 iskaa aadhaar kya he
 There is no intelligence
 raajnneetik bayaan he
 Is it possible that the Congress party is aligned with Pakistan for 2019 and doing so, there is no law to take legal action against it
 aap hairaan ho jaaenge ki is gathbandhan kaa aadhaar bataane ke liye sambit paatra twit kaa print out nikaalkar sabit kar rahe hai
 Will the logic of politics be fabricated on the basis that the headline is going on in the TV channel of Pakistan on the dispute here
 vahaan ke netaa kya twit kar rahe hai
 And on this basis, from the Prime Minister to the spokesperson of the BJP, they will say that alliances are happening with the outside countries
 rafel deal ke bare main jo sawaal uth rahe hai uske sawaal or jawaab donon rafel tak hi simit rahane chahie lekin baat kahaan se kahaan pahunch rahi he
 The Prime Minister's visit to Pakistan or Navjot Sidhu's visit there may be a debate on him, it has happened but what is the work of Pakistan when the Rafale deal is being talked about
 kya pakistan ke raashtrapati ne bayaan diya he ki anil ambani kaa naam bharat sarkaar kii taraf se aayaa tha
 Or is it the statement of former President François Hollande
 pakistan ke netaa twit kar rahe hai lekin bharat main bhi to bahut se netaa twit kar rahe hai
 Are they all helping Pakistan
 kya rafel deal ko lekar sawaal uthaane yaa raajnneeti karne kaa jawaab yahi he ki pakistan kii madad kii ja rahi he
 BJP President Amit Shah does not know when to mention Pakistan
 kabhi ve bihar kii janata se kehane lagate hai ki bijepi haar gai to pakistan main pataakhe chalenge
 The BJP lost there
 pakistan main pataakhe bhi nahin chale the
 In the context of Rafael Deal, Amit Shah made a tweet on September 22 and said that Rahul Gandhi says remove Modi
 pakistan kahata he modi hataao
 Pakistan is supporting Rahul Gandhi's baseless allegations against Modi
 to kya congress modi ke khilaaf koi antarrashtriya mahagathbandhan bana rahaa he
 Pakistan was also mentioned in the 2017 Gujarat elections
 ham yahaan chahenge ki aap yaad karen ki us bayaan ke baad kya hua
 Speaking in Palanpur, Gujarat, an allegation from Prime Minister Modi created a sensation
 us aarope ke baad news channelon par khub bahes hui
 We will tell you what the outcome of that debate was
 yah isliye bataaenge taaki ham aapako ek baar phir yaad dilaa saken ki kis tarah news channel propeganda karte hai
 If you want, you can go to youtube and see the debates after this statement again
 aap utyub main jaakar news channelon kii bahason ko zarur dekhiegaa taaki pataa chale ki in chaar saalon main godi media ne aapke saath kya kiya he
 What kind of fake questions came up that had no head and legs
 saare sawaal nakli isliye the kyonki baad main rajyasabha main arun jetali ne us bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 The statement made by Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha on 27 December 2017 is very important
 hindi main yah matlab hua ki pradhanmantri modi ne apane bayaan main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh yaa purv up raashtrapati hamid ansaari kii bharat ke prati nishtha par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 If the Prime Minister's statement makes any assumption about Manmohan Singh's commitment to India, it is not correct
 ham in netaaon kaa or bharat ke prati inaki nishtha kaa bahut aadar karte hai
 Jaitley ji is saying this
 jabaki chunaav main manishankar ayyar ke ghar hui baithak ko lekar kis tarah ke bayaan die gaye or us bayaan ke baad kya hua wo hamane aapako bataa diya
 Surely after Jaitley's statement, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad assured that we do not believe in reducing the dignity of the Prime Minister
 chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke prati die gaye aise kisi bhi bayaan se khud ko alag karte hai
 So you remember that Prime Minister Modi had to apologize to the government in the House for the way he linked Manmohan Singh and Hamid Ansari to Pakistan in the Gujarat elections
 aap hindi ke akhbaar padhate hai
 Please read them carefully
 dekhie ki rafel deal ke bare main sirf bayanon kii reporting he yaa unke yahaan kaam karne vaale shandaar reporter apni taraf se padtaal bhi kar rahe hai
 From this point of view, you will do well for talented journalists who really want to do journalism
 ek kaam kijiega, rafel deal par aapke priy hindi akhbaar main jitani bhi khabaren chhapi hai un sabko ek jagah rakhkar phir se padhie

 pakistan kaa masalaa alag he or us par baat ho sakati he or us par raajnneeti bhi ho sakati he lekin rafel ko lekar pakistan kaa kya matlab he
 Is it not that Pakistan is being used to mislead the people
 agar congress party is akhbaar ko lekar press conference kare ki pakistan or modi main santh ganth he to aap hi bataaiye kutark bhi sharma jaaenge ki nahin
 Did the Congress then have to say that Pakistan wants Modi to win and would any news anchor have debated this matter
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh ne apane fasebuk par imran khan kaa bhaashan post kiya he
 Recently elections were held in Pakistan, while speaking at a rally, Imran Khan praised the honesty of Prime Minister Modi
 to kya imran khan or pradhanmantri modi ke bich koi dosti thi, kya is aadhaar par yah nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he
 After becoming the Prime Minister, Imran Khan also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Modi and when the talks in New York were canceled, he also made abusive remarks, which all condemned
 disambar 2017 main imran khan dilli aae the or unhone pradhanmantri modi se shishtachar mulaakaat kii thi
 Can it be said on this basis that there is a friendship between Imran Khan and Prime Minister Modi
 koi ranneeti ban rahi he
 In Bhopal, Prime Minister Modi did not name Pakistan but said the same thing that Sambit Patra said in his press conference
 pehle jin logon ne sawaal kiya unhen pakistan kaa samarthak banaaya gaya
 It was spread on social media that these people are helping Pakistan
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki congress party pakistan se gathbandhan kar rahi he
 What is its basis? khufia jaankaree nahin he
 Is a political statement
 kya aisa sambhav he ki congress party pakistan se gathbandhan kar rahi he 2019 ke liye or aisa kar rahi he to uske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karne ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 You will be surprised that related Patra is proving the print out of the tweet to show the basis of this alliance
 kya is aadhaar par raajnneeti ke tark gadhe jaaenge ki yahaan ke vivaad par pakistan ke tivi channel main kya hedline chal rahi he
 What are the leaders tweeting there
 or is aadhaar par pradhanmantri se lekar bhaajapa ke pravaktaa tak yah kahenge ki baahar ke deshon ke saath gathbandhan ho rahaa he
 The questions and answers of the questions that are being raised about the Rafale Deal should be confined to Rafael but from where is the matter reaching
 pradhanmantri kaa pakistan janaa yaa navjot siddhu kaa vahaan janaa un par bahes ho sakati he, hui bhi he lekin rafel deal par jab baat ho rahi ho tab pakistan kaa kya kaam he
 Has the President of Pakistan made a statement that Anil Ambani's name came from the Indian government
 yaa yah bayaan purv raashtrapati francwa oland kaa he
 Pakistan's leaders are tweeting, but in India too many leaders are tweeting
 kya ve sabhi pakistan kii madad kar rahe hai
 Is the answer to raising questions or doing politics about the Rafael deal that Pakistan is being helped
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah to pakistan kaa zikr kab kar den pataa nahin chalata
 Sometimes they start telling the people of Bihar that if the BJP loses, then fireworks will go in Pakistan
 vahaan bijepi haar gai
 There were no firecrackers in Pakistan
 rafel deal ke sandarbh main amit shah ne 22 sitambar ko ek twit kiya or kaha ki rahul gandhi kehete hai modi hataao
 Pakistan says remove Modi
 pakistan jo he vah modi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ke aadharahin aaropon kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 So, is the Congress forming an international grand alliance against Modi
 2017 ke gujarat chunaavon me bhi pakistan kaa zikr aa gaya tha
 We would like you here to remember what happened after that statement
 gujarat ke palanpur main bolte hue pradhanmantri modi ke ek aarope ne sansani failaa di thi
 After that allegation, there was a lot of debate on the news channels
 ham aapako bataaenge ki us bahes kaa kya anjaam hua
 This will tell you so that we can remind you once again how news channels propaganda
 aap chahen to utyub par jaakar is bayaan ke baad hui bahason ko phir se dekh sakate hai
 You will definitely go to youtube and watch the debates of news channels to know what the dock media has done to you in these four years
 kis tarah ke nakli sawaal uthe jinka koi sir-pair nahin tha
 All the questions were fake because later in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley opted out of that statement
 27 disambar 2017 ko arun jetali ne rajyasabha main jo bolaa tha wo bayaan kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 In Hindi, it meant that Prime Minister Modi did not question the loyalty of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or former Vice President Hamid Ansari to India in his statement
 agar pradhanmantri ke bayaan se bharat ke prati manmohan singh kii patibaddhta ko lekar koi dharna bani he to vah sahi nahin he
 We have great respect for these leaders and their loyalty to India
 ye jetali ji kah rahe hai
 While in the election, what kind of statements were made about the meeting that took place at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house and we told you what happened after that statement
 zarur jetali ke bayaan ke baad congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne aashwaasan diya tha ki ham pradhanmantri kii garima kam karne main yakeen nahin karte hai
 Distinguishes himself from any such statement made towards the Prime Minister during elections
 to aapako yaad ho gaya ki pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat chunaavon main manmohan singh or hamid ansaari ko jis tarah se pakistan se joda use lekar sadan main sarkaar ko maafee maangani padi thi
 You read Hindi newspapers
 unhen dhyaan se padhaa kiijie
 See if the statements about the Rafael deal are just reporting or the brilliant reporters working here are also investigating on their behalf
 aap is nazar se dekhenge to vaise pratibhashali patrakaron kaa bhala karenge jo vaaki patrakarita karnaa chaahate hai
 Do one thing, keep all the news published in your favorite Hindi newspaper on Rafale Deal and keep it in one place and read it again
 aap sab ko yaad dilaa den ki bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha kaa pakistan ke raashtrapati jioul haq ke parivaar ke saath khaas rishta tha
 Shatrughan Sinha used to say from the BJP platform that Ziaul Haq's daughter is his sister
 2012 kii ek khabar he ki jab bhartiya saasandon kaa pratinidhi mandal pakistan gaya tha tab sinha jioul haq kii beti zan zia se bhi milane gaye the
 i am not giving this example because Sinha is a traitor but how can anyone doubt Sinha's patriotism
 lekin sinha ko bijepi ne 2014 main tikat diya
 Even before that he was given a ticket and made a minister
 tab kisi ne sinha se nahin kaha ki aap gaddaar hai yaa bijepi sinha ke zarie pakistan ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahati he
 Sinha has been openly playing these relationships
 kya kabhi bijepi ke bheetar se kisi ko himmat hui ki unhen pakistan kaa agent kah de
 Where have we come from? tippaniyan Companies and cricket lovers do not care what our politics thinks about Pakistan
 log intazaar karte hai ki kab pakistan se match hoga
 They watch the match whenever it happens
 dubai main bharat pakistan match ke prasaaran ke dauraan aapane kitni companiyon ke vigyaapan dekhe honge
 The market always takes advantage of the match with Pakistan
 raajnneeti hameshaa pakistan se apana bachaav karnaa chaahati he
 Recall some old statements by BJP leaders about Pakistan
 isliye rafel deal ko lekar jo sawaal uth rahaa he jawaab uskaa aana chahie
 The issue of Pakistan is different and there can be talk and politics on it, but what does Pakistan mean about Rafael
 kahin aisa to nahin ki pakistan kaa istemaal janata ko bharamaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 So whether there was any friendship between Imran Khan and Prime Minister Modi, can it be concluded on this basis
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad imran khan ne pradhanmantri modi ko patr bhi likhaa or jab neuyork main hone vaali baatcheet radd hui to abhadra tippanee bhi kii, jisaki sabane ninda kii

 Will the logic of politics be fabricated on the basis that the headline is going on in the TV channel of Pakistan on the dispute here
 vahaan ke netaa kya twit kar rahe hai
 And on this basis, from the Prime Minister to the spokesperson of the BJP, they will say that alliances are happening with the outside countries
 rafel deal ke bare main jo sawaal uth rahe hai uske sawaal or jawaab donon rafel tak hi simit rahane chahie lekin baat kahaan se kahaan pahunch rahi he
 The Prime Minister's visit to Pakistan or Navjot Sidhu's visit there may be a debate on him, it has happened but what is the work of Pakistan when the Rafale deal is being talked about
 kya pakistan ke raashtrapati ne bayaan diya he ki anil ambani kaa naam bharat sarkaar kii taraf se aayaa tha
 Or is it the statement of former President François Hollande
 pakistan ke netaa twit kar rahe hai lekin bharat main bhi to bahut se netaa twit kar rahe hai
 Are they all helping Pakistan
 kya rafel deal ko lekar sawaal uthaane yaa raajnneeti karne kaa jawaab yahi he ki pakistan kii madad kii ja rahi he
 BJP President Amit Shah does not know when to mention Pakistan
 kabhi ve bihar kii janata se kehane lagate hai ki bijepi haar gai to pakistan main pataakhe chalenge
 The BJP lost there
 pakistan main pataakhe bhi nahin chale the
 In the context of Rafael Deal, Amit Shah made a tweet on September 22 and said that Rahul Gandhi says remove Modi
 pakistan kahata he modi hataao
 Pakistan is supporting Rahul Gandhi's baseless allegations against Modi
 to kya congress modi ke khilaaf koi antarrashtriya mahagathbandhan bana rahaa he
 Pakistan was also mentioned in the 2017 Gujarat elections
 ham yahaan chahenge ki aap yaad karen ki us bayaan ke baad kya hua
 Speaking in Palanpur, Gujarat, an allegation from Prime Minister Modi created a sensation
 us aarope ke baad news channelon par khub bahes hui
 We will tell you what the outcome of that debate was
 yah isliye bataaenge taaki ham aapako ek baar phir yaad dilaa saken ki kis tarah news channel propeganda karte hai
 If you want, you can go to youtube and see the debates after this statement again
 aap utyub main jaakar news channelon kii bahason ko zarur dekhiegaa taaki pataa chale ki in chaar saalon main godi media ne aapke saath kya kiya he
 What kind of fake questions came up that had no head and legs
 saare sawaal nakli isliye the kyonki baad main rajyasabha main arun jetali ne us bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 The statement made by Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha on 27 December 2017 is very important
 hindi main yah matlab hua ki pradhanmantri modi ne apane bayaan main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh yaa purv up raashtrapati hamid ansaari kii bharat ke prati nishtha par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 If the Prime Minister's statement makes any assumption about Manmohan Singh's commitment to India, it is not correct
 ham in netaaon kaa or bharat ke prati inaki nishtha kaa bahut aadar karte hai
 Jaitley ji is saying this
 jabaki chunaav main manishankar ayyar ke ghar hui baithak ko lekar kis tarah ke bayaan die gaye or us bayaan ke baad kya hua wo hamane aapako bataa diya
 Surely after Jaitley's statement, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad assured that we do not believe in reducing the dignity of the Prime Minister
 chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke prati die gaye aise kisi bhi bayaan se khud ko alag karte hai
 So you remember that Prime Minister Modi had to apologize to the government in the House for the way he linked Manmohan Singh and Hamid Ansari to Pakistan in the Gujarat elections
 aap hindi ke akhbaar padhate hai
 Please read them carefully
 dekhie ki rafel deal ke bare main sirf bayanon kii reporting he yaa unke yahaan kaam karne vaale shandaar reporter apni taraf se padtaal bhi kar rahe hai
 From this point of view, you will do well for talented journalists who really want to do journalism
 ek kaam kijiega, rafel deal par aapke priy hindi akhbaar main jitani bhi khabaren chhapi hai un sabko ek jagah rakhkar phir se padhie
 Remind you all that BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha had a special relationship with the family of Pakistan President Ziaul Haq
 shatrughna sinha bijepi ke manch se kaha karte the ki jioul haq kii beti unki bahan he
 There is a report in 2012 that when the delegation of Indian mps visited Pakistan, Sinha also went to meet Ziaul Haq's daughter Zain Zia
 main yah misaal isliye nahin de rahaa ki sinha deshadrohi hai balki sinha ke deshprem par koi shaq kaise kar saktaa he
 But Sinha was given a ticket in 2014 by the BJP
 uske pehle bhi tikat diya or mantri banaaya
 Then no one told Sinha that you are a traitor or BJP wants to combine with Pakistan through Sinha
 sinha apane in sambandhon ko khulkar nibhaate rahe hai
 Has anyone from within BJP dared to call him an agent of Pakistan? ham kahaan se kahaan aa gaye hai
 The comments companiyon or cricket premiyon ko kuch fark nahin padataa ki hamaari raajnneeti pakistan ke bare main kya sochati he
 People wait when Pakistan will match
 jab bhi hota he ve match dekhte hai
 During the broadcast of India Pakistan match in Dubai, you must have seen how many companies advertisements
 bazaar hameshaa pakistan ke saath hone vaale match kaa laabh uthaata he
 Politics always wants to defend itself from Pakistan
 pakistan ko lekar bhaajapa netaaon ke kuch puraane bayanon ko yaad karte hai
 Therefore, the question arising on Rafael Deal should be answered
 pakistan kaa masalaa alag he or us par baat ho sakati he or us par raajnneeti bhi ho sakati he lekin rafel ko lekar pakistan kaa kya matlab he
 Is it not that Pakistan is being used to mislead the people
 pradhanmantri kaa pakistan janaa yaa navjot siddhu kaa vahaan janaa un par bahes ho sakati he, hui bhi he lekin rafel deal par jab baat ho rahi ho tab pakistan kaa kya kaam he
 Has the President of Pakistan made a statement that Anil Ambani's name came from the Indian government
 yaa yah bayaan purv raashtrapati francwa oland kaa he
 Pakistan's leaders are tweeting, but in India too many leaders are tweeting
 kya ve sabhi pakistan kii madad kar rahe hai
 Is the answer to raising questions or doing politics about the Rafael deal that Pakistan is being helped
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah to pakistan kaa zikr kab kar den pataa nahin chalata
 Sometimes they start telling the people of Bihar that if the BJP loses, then fireworks will go in Pakistan
 vahaan bijepi haar gai
 There were no firecrackers in Pakistan
 rafel deal ke sandarbh main amit shah ne 22 sitambar ko ek twit kiya or kaha ki rahul gandhi kehete hai modi hataao
 Pakistan says remove Modi
 pakistan jo he vah modi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ke aadharahin aaropon kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 So, is the Congress forming an international grand alliance against Modi
 2017 ke gujarat chunaavon me bhi pakistan kaa zikr aa gaya tha
 We would like you here to remember what happened after that statement
 gujarat ke palanpur main bolte hue pradhanmantri modi ke ek aarope ne sansani failaa di thi
 After that allegation, there was a lot of debate on the news channels
 ham aapako bataaenge ki us bahes kaa kya anjaam hua
 This will tell you so that we can remind you once again how news channels propaganda
 aap chahen to utyub par jaakar is bayaan ke baad hui bahason ko phir se dekh sakate hai
 You will definitely go to youtube and watch the debates of news channels to know what the dock media has done to you in these four years
 kis tarah ke nakli sawaal uthe jinka koi sir-pair nahin tha
 All the questions were fake because later in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley opted out of that statement
 27 disambar 2017 ko arun jetali ne rajyasabha main jo bolaa tha wo bayaan kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 In Hindi, it meant that Prime Minister Modi did not question the loyalty of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or former Vice President Hamid Ansari to India in his statement
 agar pradhanmantri ke bayaan se bharat ke prati manmohan singh kii patibaddhta ko lekar koi dharna bani he to vah sahi nahin he
 We have great respect for these leaders and their loyalty to India
 ye jetali ji kah rahe hai
 While in the election, what kind of statements were made about the meeting that took place at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house and we told you what happened after that statement
 zarur jetali ke bayaan ke baad congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne aashwaasan diya tha ki ham pradhanmantri kii garima kam karne main yakeen nahin karte hai
 Distinguishes himself from any such statement made towards the Prime Minister during elections
 to aapako yaad ho gaya ki pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat chunaavon main manmohan singh or hamid ansaari ko jis tarah se pakistan se joda use lekar sadan main sarkaar ko maafee maangani padi thi
 You read Hindi newspapers
 unhen dhyaan se padhaa kiijie
 See if the statements about the Rafael deal are just reporting or the brilliant reporters working here are also investigating on their behalf
 aap is nazar se dekhenge to vaise pratibhashali patrakaron kaa bhala karenge jo vaaki patrakarita karnaa chaahate hai
 Do one thing, keep all the news published in your favorite Hindi newspaper on Rafale Deal and keep it in one place and read it again
 aap sab ko yaad dilaa den ki bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha kaa pakistan ke raashtrapati jioul haq ke parivaar ke saath khaas rishta tha
 Shatrughan Sinha used to say from the BJP platform that Ziaul Haq's daughter is his sister
 2012 kii ek khabar he ki jab bhartiya saasandon kaa pratinidhi mandal pakistan gaya tha tab sinha jioul haq kii beti zan zia se bhi milane gaye the
 i am not giving this example because Sinha is a traitor but how can anyone doubt Sinha's patriotism
 lekin sinha ko bijepi ne 2014 main tikat diya
 Even before that he was given a ticket and made a minister
 tab kisi ne sinha se nahin kaha ki aap gaddaar hai yaa bijepi sinha ke zarie pakistan ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahati he
 Sinha has been openly playing these relationships
 kya kabhi bijepi ke bheetar se kisi ko himmat hui ki unhen pakistan kaa agent kah de
 Where have we come from? tippaniyan Companies and cricket lovers do not care what our politics thinks about Pakistan
 log intazaar karte hai ki kab pakistan se match hoga
 They watch the match whenever it happens
 dubai main bharat pakistan match ke prasaaran ke dauraan aapane kitni companiyon ke vigyaapan dekhe honge
 The market always takes advantage of the match with Pakistan
 raajnneeti hameshaa pakistan se apana bachaav karnaa chaahati he
 Recall some old statements by BJP leaders about Pakistan
 isliye rafel deal ko lekar jo sawaal uth rahaa he jawaab uskaa aana chahie
 The issue of Pakistan is different and there can be talk and politics on it, but what does Pakistan mean about Rafael

 There is a report in 2012 that when the delegation of Indian mps visited Pakistan, Sinha also went to meet Ziaul Haq's daughter Zain Zia
 main yah misaal isliye nahin de rahaa ki sinha deshadrohi hai balki sinha ke deshprem par koi shaq kaise kar saktaa he
 But Sinha was given a ticket in 2014 by the BJP
 uske pehle bhi tikat diya or mantri banaaya
 Then no one told Sinha that you are a traitor or BJP wants to combine with Pakistan through Sinha
 sinha apane in sambandhon ko khulkar nibhaate rahe hai
 Has anyone from within BJP dared to call him an agent of Pakistan? ham kahaan se kahaan aa gaye hai
 The comments companiyon or cricket premiyon ko kuch fark nahin padataa ki hamaari raajnneeti pakistan ke bare main kya sochati he
 People wait when Pakistan will match
 jab bhi hota he ve match dekhte hai

 Is it not that Pakistan is being used to mislead the people

 The issue of Pakistan is different and there can be talk and politics on it, but what does Pakistan mean about Rafael
 kahin aisa to nahin ki pakistan kaa istemaal janata ko bharamaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he

 On Friday, in an informal conversation with reporters, Nitish Kumar asked that the ticket of Saryu Rai was cut on the basis that he was an old friend of Nitish Kumar and he got his book released to Nitish Kumar, then Nitish Kumar said to this That this friendship is none other than the 40-year-old student life, both of them have been friends
 nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ne kaha ki kai baar unhone sarayu raay ko jharkhand se waapas bihar aate apane saath raajnneeti karne kaa nyauta bhi diya lekin wo kinhin kaarnon se unke efort ko kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya

 tab unhone kaha ki unhone pehle se hi man bana liya tha jharkhand main chunaav prachaar se wo alag rahenge isliye wo sarayu raay ke liye bhi prachaar karne nahin ja rahe hai
 Certainly after this statement, the campaign of the group will get a lot of strength, because after the announcement of his not coming in the campaign, there were claims by BJP leaders in Jamshedpur that Nitish left Saryu Rai in the middle

 In the agustawestland case, the middleman Mitchell had told the court that he was harassed by other prisoners and asked questions related to the deal and, therefore, be given a separate cell
 mishael ko 3,600 karod rupee ke is saude ke silsile main sanyukt arab emirate main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or chaar disambar ko bharat laayaa gaya tha
 He was sent to 14 days judicial custody on Wednesday

 The other two middlemen are Ralph Guido Haske and Carlo Gerosa
 yah puraa sauda kareeb 3,600 karod rupee kaa tha
 What was more, he was a democrat at Hadarje
 yun to unhen vampanthi bataaya jaataa he, lekin swayan vampanth ke alag-alag dhadon se unka kashmakash chalata rahata, isi vajah se kisi bhi prakaar kaa vampanth ho, unhen andeh kii najar se dekha jaataa tha
 He used to make fun of the skeptics and there was so much freshness, so much newness in his words, which surprised everyone
 vah sachche dil se koshish karte the ki nayi peedi panape, aage bade
 All these things were plentiful even when he was eighty years old
 vah kaise aisa ban sake, koun-si prishthbhumi iske peeche he- yahi mul jigyaasa thi, jo hamen unke jivan kii gaharaai main jhaankne ko prerit karti thi
 There were many reasons for this, which have gone into detail in this book
 nagarjun kaa jivan yayavari kaa jivan tha
 Even in old age, he used to say that whenever i fall ill, cut a train ticket and board it in the car, i will be cured
 jab vah sarkaar kii vikaas-avadharana par khisiate to kehete ki yadi or kuch bhi karne main sarkaar bilkul hi naakaam he to yahi kar de ki har naagarik ko desh-bhraman karvaa de, isse kupamandukata to khatm hogi
 Leaving from the wisdom of Kashi, he went towards Arya Samaj, went to Sri Lanka to become a Buddhist, returned from there and joined the freedom struggle
 bhumigat rahakar varshon krantikari kisaan aandolan main shaamil rahe, swami sahjanand or subhash bose ke saath raajnneeti kii
 The Prime Ministers of the country wrote fire-burning poems against every anti-people verdict of the governments, how many times they were imprisoned, whenever there was a mass movement in the country, in any province, they joined it
 is tarah se dekhen to aazaadee ke pehle or aazaadee ke baad kaa jo bharat kaa sau barason kaa itihaas he, vah nagarjun ke jivan main murtiman tha
 All these things have come in this book
 hamaare ek vidwaan adhyeta tripurari sharan ne to us din kii goshtee main kaha bhi ki aaj kaa jo yuva he vah yadi apane desh ke banane-bigadane kaa sau baras kaa saamaajik sarokaari itihaas jaananaa chahta he, to shaayad use or kahin jane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Secondly, we had many big writers whose biographies were written and they became very famous
 inamen sharadchandra, niraala or premchand mukhya hai
 You will see that the big writers of the time not only write, they increase the power of their language with their writing
 jin kuch chizon kii abhivyakti ke liye ab tak bhashaa main koi shaur nahin thi, aise bade lekhak vah jaruri samarthy apane likhe se paidaa karte hai
 Nagarjuna was the author of this category
 aamtaur par rajanetaaon kii jeevani likhi jaati he jiske peeche samaj yah hoti he ki vah ek prayaas kii katha hoti he ki unhone is desh kii behatari ke haq main kaise sochaa
 In the context of Nagarjuna, leave aside the talk of the leader, he considered a writer a thing even higher than political parties, provided that the writer is politically conscious and deeply connected to the public
 vah kehete the ki raajnneetik dal jo faisla letaa he uske justification main bataata he ki yah saikadon dimag se kiye gaye chintan kaa nateeja he
 Nagarjuna believed that the author is representative of thousands, millions of minds
 uski baat ekadam se avichaarneey nahin ho sakati
 a representative can get a position only through attachment to the public, not with money and power
 yah badi baat isliye he ki baaki sab ko, bado-bado ko bhi to thode dinon main mar-khap janaa he, lekin janata to rahegi
 He is eternal
 nagarjun is tarah sochate the or isi ko saadhane kii koshish main lage rahete the
 You will also believe that the public must have a biography of such a man
 iske rachananubhav kii kuch baaten maine kitaab kii bhoomika main likhi hai
 Let me tell you a passage which may give some idea of the direction of my curiosity
 yah krantikari kisaan aandolan main unki bhagidaari ke daur kaa maamla he
 When asked about how Nagarjuna's political initiation took place, where his political ideas were emanating, he simply told a line that Bhai, a month-long 'summer School of Politics' was held in Sonepur, in which the socialists thrashed all over India Had taken class, where we had studied for a month as Nagarjuna, a monk clad in chevrons
 matlab jo liya vahiin se liya
 In the days of freedom struggle, especially in the revolutionary movement, such training camps were often run, whose aim was to make the common man politically aware
 nagarjun ko dekhen to paaenge ki unke raajnneetik adarsh itane oonche or nishtha itani gahari thi ki vah party-netritv tak kii parvaah karnaa, jarurat padane par chhod sakate the
 Where did he get this power? What were his ideals? The answer is available from other sources, but it was necessary for a biographer to find the details of the school that lasted that month
 ab mushkil yah ki utane vishaal, bahuaiami swatantraaa-sangram ke bheetar is maheene bhar ke skool kii bhala kya aukaat ho sakati thi, isliye is bare main kitabon main, patrikaon main kuch bhi likhaa nahin miltaa tha
 In such a situation, i went to the old government archives and started researching the CID report
 british sarkaar kaa khufia tantra bada hi majboot tha or isaki jaden un ashaanti ke dinon main chaaron ore faili thim
 Well, the DIG, intelligence about that school has got a long report, but also the essence of the so-called inflammatory speeches of the monk Nagarjuna in many public meetings
 aadi-aadi
 There are still thousands of people in the country who have a lot of precious memoirs of Nagarjuna
 unase guzarana aapako romanchit karata he kyonki ve itane positive hai ki hamamen pukhta yakeen bharte hai
 But, ultimately i had to limit myself to written evidence, because the pages of any book have their limits
 nagarjun jahaan bhi hote, bahut duubakar apni sampoornataa main hote the
 Because of this, he would inevitably influence his time, atmosphere
 in sab prasangon ko us yug main pahunchakar or unke saath hokar dekhnaa or use anubhav karnaa bahut rochak anubhav tha
 i can never forget this
 kahen ki ab yah meri daulat he
 The second was also that Nagarjuna was not a man of blind faith in his youth
 isliye tikaa-tippanee, aalochana-pratyaalochana chalati rahati thi donon ke bich
 After independence, the zamindari was eradicated, its entire chair was maintained by Sahajanand and we can be proud of the literature that our poets and writers also played an active role in it
 yah or baat he ki satta par jo log kabiz hue unhone kabhi bhi bhumisudhar lagu nahin hone diya, kyonki yah to unke liye apane hi pairon par kulhada maarna hota
 Taranand Viyogi - i am currently working on the history of Maithili poetry
 hajaar varshon main ek samaaj ne kis tarah se, kitne roopon prarupon main apane ko abhivyakt kiya, rochak he yah sab dekhnaa
 Then, something has to be done about Nagarjuna and the many materials that are stored there
 sambhav he ki aage 'yugon kaa yatri' kaa doosraa bhaag bhi aae
 But, my real plan is for ethnic novels
 ki kaise ek hi samay kai-kai anterdharaayein chalati rahati hai or kin vajahon se kuch pramukhataa praapt kar letin, baaki ko peeche dhakel detii hai, phir wo chijen apane liye kaise spes banaati rahati hai
 etc etc
 likhuunga abhi
 i have a lot of things right now

 a government decree in Kerala has created a ruckus
 rajya ke sthaneey prashasnic vibhaag dwaara sthaneey nikaayon ko 18 saal se kam umr kii muslim ladakiyon or 21 saal se kam umr ke ladakon ke vivaahon kaa panjikaran (registration) karne ke liye jari kiye gaye aadhikarik circular se kerala main vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 In this circular issued by the principal secretary of the local administrative department, the local bodies were instructed to register the weddings of Muslim girls and boys who have not completed the 18 years and 21 years of age required for marriage respectively
 nikaayon ko yah registration dharmik santhaan kii ore se jari pramaan patr ke aadhaar par karne ke nirdesh die gaye
 Official sources said that there were complaints that the secretaries working as registrars in local bodies were reluctant to register such marriages
 is vajah se khadi deshon main jane kii ichha rakhane vaale in logon ko pareshaani hoti he
 The Gulf countries demand a marriage certificate issued by local bodies for migration
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha ki in shikayaton ko dekhte hue yah circular jari kiya gaya
 Left-wing women's and cultural organizations have come out against this circular
 unka kahana he ki yah kadam rajya ko madhyakaalin yug main dhakel degaa
 Professor VN Murali, president of the CPM pro-cultural organization 'purogamna Kala Sahitya Sangam', said, 'there is a legal ban on child marriage
 rudhiwaadi dhadon ke dabaav main liye gaye faisle ko nirast kar diya janaa chahie
 PP Balan, director of the Kerala Local Administrative Institute, also sought clarification from the government on the registration of such marriages under the rules of the Kerala Marriage Registration provisions
 sarkaar kaa spashtikaran yah he ki muslim vivaah niyam, 1957 umraseema par jor nahin detaa or bal vivaah roak kanoon, 2006 yah nahin spasht karata ki 21 saal se kam umr ke ladke or 18 saal se kam umr kii ladki ke bich vivaah avaidh he
 Hence the registration of marriages of Muslims can be done without meeting the minimum age
 is certificate kaa kadaa virodh karne waalon kaa kahana he ki yah samvidhan kii bhaavana ke khilaaf or iske dwaara supreme court ke us aadesh kaa ulanghan he, jisamen usne vivaahon ke liye umraseema tay kii thim
 According to the lawyers, any administrative order issued against the law can be challenged in court
 china ne buudhvaar ko spasht kar diya he ki vah arunachal pradesh ke kisi adhikari ko vija nahin degaa or pradesh ke anya nagarikon ko natthi vija dena jari rakhega
 China claims Arunachal Pradesh
 purv ke chalan ke vipareet arunachal pradesh ke do nagarikon ko haal hi main natthi vija die jane kii report kii prishthbhumi main chini ucchayog ke ek adhikari ne naam nahin ujagar karne kii shart par bataaya ki arunachal pradesh ke nagarikon ke liye vija niti main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 "there is no change in our visa policy for the citizens of Arunachal Pradesh," the official said
 china is pradesh ke adhikariyon ko vija nahin jari karata he or aage bhi aisa nahin karegaa
 We only issue stapled visas for other citizens
 arunachal pradesh ke logon ko natthi vija jari karne kii ghatana us samay samane ai jab rajya ke do khilaadiyo ko avrajan adhikariyon ne roak diya kyonki chini ucchayog ne unhen natthi vija jari kiya tha
 a state lifter, along with Avraham Techi, joint secretary of the Indian Association of Bhartolan, was stopped by immigration officials at the IGI Airport in New Delhi as the Chinese High Commission issued him a stapled visa
 baharhaal, china ke kadam par pratikriya vyakt karte hue bhartiya videsh mantralay ne kaha ki arunachal pradesh bharat kaa abhinn ang he or is bare main chini paksh ko suchit kar diya gaya he ki jati yaa sthaan se pare bharat ke nagarikon ko vija jari karne ke liye samaan prakriya apanaayi jaani chahie
 In this case, the ministry pointed to a consultation issued to Indian citizens in November 2009 stating that stapled visas with passports would not be valid
 gauratlab he ki china ne jammu kashmir ke logon ko 2008 se natthi vija jari karnaa shuru kiya tha jiskaa uddeshy ise vivaadit kshetra ke rup main pesh karnaa tha
 In the case of Arunachal Pradesh, visas were not issued to the people of this region earlier

 gujarat kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri anandiben patel ke istife ke baad bijepi nae mukhyamantri ke naam kaa elaan agle do-teen din main kar sakati he
 BJP can also make Amit Shah the next CM to handle the crumbling support base in Gujarat
 online media reports ke mutabik gujarat ke agle siem ke taur par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke naam par bhi gambhirtha se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In the political corridor, some other names are being discussed for the claimant of this post
 sutron ke mutabikmukhyamantri banane kii res mensbase upar gujarat bijepi ke adhyaksh vijay rupani kaa naam liya ja rahaa he
 Actually, Vijay Rupani is said to have a good hold in the organization
 anubhav ke saath hi vishwasaneey cheharaa hai rupanianandiben ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad rajya main party kaa sanghathan kamjor ho rahaa tha
 The bjp's internal mobilization was going to the high command
 yahi vajah thi ki sanghathan ko majboot banane ke liye vijay rupani ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 However, Vijay Rupani himself is also in the role of Transport Minister in the government
 aise main sarkaar chalaane kaa anubhav bhi unke paas kareeb ek saal kaa he
 Rupanivijay Rupani, who is also close to Shah, is being named above all because he is one of Amit Shah's close ones
 saath hi sarkaar or sanghathan kaa samanvay wo bakhubi kar rahe hai
 Even in the last days, all the important schemes of the government were announced by Vijay Rupani in place of Anandiben Patel
 haalanki jaankaar ye bhi maan rahe hai kigaiyr-patidaar samudaay se mukhyamantribanaae jane par bijepi ko gujarat main patidaar voton kaa nuksaan bhi jhelana pad saktaa he
 Nitin Patel, a close confidant of Modi, also has another name coming up as Anandiben's successor in the race
 nitin patel ek to patidaar samudaay se aate hai, saath hi wo lambey vakt se sarkaar main mantri bane hue hai
 When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, Nitin Patel was one of the leaders close to Modi
 haalanki patidaar andolan ke vakt par nitin patel ko apane hi patidaar samaaj ke gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 Even the Patidars had brought Nitin Patel into the community on the edge
 aise main sawaal yah bhi he ki kya nitin patel bijepi kii ummiido par khara utrenge
 The name of Bhikhu Dalsania is also the chair of the third party
 bhikhu dalsania pichley lambey vakt sebijapi ke sanghathanamen kaam kar rahe hai
 When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, Bhikhu had a very good hold in the organization
 wo aresas ke bhi kaaphi kareebi rahe he
 Clean image and casteist equations are also seen in favor of Bhikhu
 purushottam rupala or saurabh patel ke naam par phul stop!purushottam rupala or saurabh patel ke naam par purnaviram lagata dikh rahaa he
 Rupala has recently been made a member of the Rajya Sabha and has also been given a ministerial position at the center
 vaise main wo istipha den or gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane, yah baat har kisi ke gale nahin utar rahi he
 On the other hand, being the son-in-law of the Ambani family, there is no hope of Saurabh Patel becoming the Chief Minister
 agar saurabh patel ko siem banaaya jaataa he to 2017 main pehali baar gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa plan bana rahi aam aadmi party ko baithe bithaae ek mudda mil jayega
 Which can also become a loss deal for BJP in the assembly elections

 The parliamentary party decides on that
