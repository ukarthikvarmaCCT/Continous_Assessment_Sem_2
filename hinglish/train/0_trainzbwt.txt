 kashmir mudde par baatcheet karne ke liye centre sarkaar kii ore se niyukt kiye gaye vaartakar dineshwar sharma somvaar ko srinagar pahunch gaye
 At the same time, the main opposition Congress has raised many questions about Sharma's visit to the valley
 congress communication department ke pramukh randeep surajevaala ne 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or unki sarkaar kii kashmir ko lekar koi niti nahin he
 According to Surjewala, the government has to make clear what are the areas and jurisdiction of Sharma who went to the valley as a negotiator? Surjewala said that we are not against negotiation but the government has to clear who are the parties? Which parties has the Prime Minister authorized? Questioning the Modi government's intention, what is the level of negotiation and what is the status of the negotiating jurisdiction? Surjewala, the Congress's chief spokesperson, said, "this government has neither cleared the role and jurisdiction of the talkative Sharma nor the parties Is defined
 is sab kii anupasthiti main kis tarah kii baatcheet hogi sivaay photo khinchvaane ke avasar ke? kya yahi sarkaar kaa makasad he?'bataa den ki sharma jammu or kashmir main centre sarkaar ke vishesh pratinidhi ke naate ghati ke daure ke dauraan sabhi pakshakaron se sampark karenge or ghati main baatcheet kii prakriya ko shuru karne kii koshish karenge
 The separatist organizations have already announced to stay away from the conversation, showing a cold attitude towards Sharma's visit
 surajevaala ne kaha ki ham baatcheet ke khilaaf nahin hai, ham vahaan saamaanya sthiti behaal dekhnaa chaahate hai
 While staying within the constitution of the country, every party that is affected should be talked about
 samvidhan ke daayre se baahar kisi vyakti yaa sanghathan se koi baat nahin ho sakati
 Not an inch can be compromised
 sarkaar ne naa tovartakaraki bhoomika ko saaf kiya he or naa hi pakshakaron ko paribhaashit kiya he
 Why is it not being made public? Why is it being kept as a top secret? Surjewala accused the Modi government of not having a clear policy on Kashmir
 surajevaala ne kaha ki traasadee ye he ki jammu or kashmir main saamaanya sthiti behaal karne kii disha main aage badhane ke liemodi sarkaaraki naa koi niti he, naa disha he or naa hi duuradrushti
 The truth is that our soldiers, our soldiers are getting martyred to protect their motherland
 aise main buniyadi sawaal yahi he ki niti kya he or aage badhane kaa rasta kya he? Performing tricks on a rope swinging between two mountain peaks in a rocky part of the Hind Sahasagar was going to be overwhelming for Corali Jirault, and he almost lost his life
 
 
 lekin kehete hai na, jako raakhe saaiyaan
 
 
 In Reunion Island, Coralie Jireault, who stopped the beats to cross a distance of about 31 meters between two peaks when walking on a rope, suddenly reached the middle of the rope, suddenly the sea became turbulent, and the high drying waves Started getting up tippaniyan It can be clearly seen in the video that amidst the sea waves taking dangerous form, Coralie is trying to maintain her balance on the rope in a very frightening situation when a wave of about 40 feet high catches her at a very dangerous speed She takes it, and goes completely 'lil'
 korali jirolt ke lahar dwaara nigal liye jane ke baad har dekhne vaale kii saans ekadam rukne kii kagaar par pahunch jaati he, kyonki video shoot kar rahi uski mitra kaa bhi santulan bighad jaataa he, or camera hilne lagata he, kyonki lahar kaa asar us chattan tak hua, jis par khadi hokar vah shooting kar rahi he
 But after a few moments when the wave calmly falls down, Coralie starts to appear on the rope, and breathes in breath
 video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki khatarnaak rup akhriyaar karti ja rahi samudri laharon ke bich korali behad bhayaavah sthiti main rassi par apana santulan banaae rakhane kii koshish kar rahi he ki tabhi lagbhag 40 foot oonchi ek lahar behad khatarnaak gati se use apni chapet main le leti he, or puri tarah 'leel' jaati he
 After Coralie Jireault is swallowed by the wave, each viewer's breath is on the verge of stopping, as the balance of his friend shooting the video also worsens, and the camera starts to move, as the effect of the wave hits that rock
 Till happened, on which she is shooting while standing
 lekin kuch hi pal ke baad jab lahar shant hokar neeche gir jaati he, korali rassi par maujuud nazar aane lagati he, or saans main saans aati he
 But after a few moments when the wave calmly falls down, Coralie starts to appear on the rope, and breathes in breath

 5GB data se badhaakar pratidin 3GB data kar diya tha
 However, the validity of both plans is 28 days
 lekin mahatvapurn baat ye he ki jeeyo kaa ye plan airtel kii tulana main thodaa sasta he
 Apart from this, the company has plans of Rs 19, Rs 52 and Rs 98, if you talk about small recharge of Jio
 19 rupee vaale plan kii validity 1 din kii he or isamen 0

 The Jaikwadi dam on the Godavari river in Aurangabad caters to all the water needs of the two districts of Aurangabad and Jalna - this leads to water for drinking water, irrigation and industry
 lekin is saal march main hi is jalashay main itnaa pani nahin bachaa ki use kaam main laayaa ja sake
 On average, the water level in this reservoir at this time is 30% of the capacity, which has come down to zero till 31 March this year
 pichley saal is samay pani kaa str 13 fisadi tha
 The Central Water Commission chairman GS Jha told NDTV, "the water level in the dam has fallen to zero which means that there is no useable water left in this dam which is a matter of concern"
 yahi haal parabhani ke yaldari baandh kaa he
 The dam, which provides water to three districts, has only 4% water to be used

 Top officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said that the decision to limit the entry of tourists to the Taj Mahal campus will be decided based on a study being conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)
 unhone kaha ki prasiddh smarak ke sangrakshan ke liye eesai kuch khaas kadam uthaaegi

 He said that ASI will take some special steps to preserve the famous monument

 It is understood that the proposals being considered include the proposal for the Tajmahal's Didar to be cut within the time period currently prescribed

 As of July 2, the country has reduced 31 percent rainfall
 jiskaa asar maharashtra, rajasthan, bihar, upi or empi main dhan kii buaayi par padaa he
 On the other hand, the rain has become fatal in Mumbai
 somvaar der shaam yahaan jhamajham pani gira to yahaan ke pawai ilaake main do bacchon ke liye ye jaanaleva ban gaya
 The rain spread the current and killed two children
 haalanki krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne ummid jataayi he ki agle hafte tak monsoon main teji aegi, saath hi unhone kaha ki abhi tak monsoon dhila rahaa he lekin halaat chintajanak nahin hai
 He said that the sowing of soybean and cotton has been good
 lekin mungfalee or dalhar kii buaayi main kami aayi he
 In Mumbai, rain and negligence took away a mother's life
 bilakhti maa us pal ko kos rahi hogi, jab sagar paas kii dukaan main jane ke liye ghar se niklaa
 Due to the accumulation of water on the road, people were walking along the shore
 isi dauraan sagar or uske saath chal rahe taahir naam ke bachche ne lohe kii is seedhi ko haath laga diya
 Both children died of electric shock
 somvaar raat hui barish or tej hawaaon ne mumbai ke kai ilaakon main tabaahi machaai
 Trees fell in many areas including Kurla, Chembur, Ghatkopar
 chembur main ek ghar par ped gir padaa, jisamen mahila kii jaan bal-bal bachi
 The mainhole has been warned to open on the middle road in Hindmata area of mumbai
 had to ye ki bade-bade jenerator pani nikasi ke kaam main lagaae gaye hai lekin sadak par sailaab aa hi jaataa he
 The most shameful thing is that just one hour of continuous rain has made Mumbai such a situation
 yani aane vaale dinon ke liye mumbai vaale pehle se khud ko taiyaar kar len kyonki biemasi ne is saal bhi puraani parampara hi doharaai he
 The Meteorological Department has forecast heavy rain for the next 48 hours
 iske alaava haai tide kii bhi chetavanee di gayi he
 Events after the rain are forgotten as an accident
 lekin kya sagar or taahir kii maut mahaj haadasa he
 Will the police be able to reach its real perpetrators? is bich mumbai main mangalvaar dopaher main hytide kii bhi ashanka jataai ja rahi he
 It is said that the tide will rise in the sea at 12
55 minutes
 ashanka he ki samandar kii lehren 4
 Can rise up to 6 meters
 aise main dar ye he ki shahar main jo pani bharaa he, wo baahar nahin nikal paaegaa
 There is also fear of rain after high tide
 chhattisgarh main police ko ek badi kamyaabi mili he
 Where in the most Naxal-affected Bastar district, about two dozen Naxalites surrendered to the police
 inamen teen inami naksali bhi shaamil hai
 Superintendent of Police of Bastar District R
 en
 Das said that 23 Naxalites have surrendered to the police during an event organized at the district headquarters
 samarpan karne vaale naksaliyon main teen janamilicia commander, ek jan milicia dipti commander, chaar dkeemes sadsy, 10 jan milicia sadsy or paanch sangham sadsy shaamil hai
 Superintendent of Police Das said that among the surrendered Naxalites, a reward of Rs 1 lakh has been declared on the heads of Janamilisia Commander Kamlesh Nag, Janamilisia Commander Tulsi Ram Nag and Jan Militia Platoon Commander Naresh Kumar Kashyap
 police adhikari ne bataaya kiatmasamarpanakarne vaale sabhi naksaliyon ke paas rashan card or aadhaar card hai, jabaki chaar naksaliyon ke paas indira awaas or 20 naksaliyon ke paas matadaata parichay patr hai or 14 naksaliyon kaa bank main khaataa bhi he
 According to the police, the reason for keeping official documents is that whoever is a lower level Naxalite, they are local Naxalites and they roam with native weapons
 sthaneey naksali hi naksaliyon kii sabase badi takat hote hai
 The police want the local Naxalites to surrender and fight the external Naxalites together with the police
 das ne bataaya ki kai saamaajik sanghathan aarope lagaate hai ki police aise adivaasiyon kaa bhi samarpan karwaati he, jo naksali nahin he
 But it is clear that Naxalites also keep documents issued by the government which is part of their strategy
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki aatmasamarpit naksali sanghathan ke sadasyon ko protsaahan raashi ke rup main shashan kii ore se das-das hajaar rupe die ja rahe hai
 They will also be given other benefits of the rehabilitation policy
 narendra modi ke shapath grahan ke baad bijepi ke saath jediu kii apratyaksh rup se takaraar saamne ai he
 This time the JDU has not taken any ministerial position in the Modi government
 iske baad janata dal united (JDU) ke adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ishaaron-ishaaron main jataayaa ki party bijepi se naaraaz he
 He said, such reports are coming in the media that we are demanding 3 seats which is totally wrong
 patna airport par utarane ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue nitish kumaar ne saaf kah diya ki unki ummid thi ki sankhya bal ke aadhaar par bijepi sahyogi dalon ko mantriparishad main jagah degi magar aisa nahin hua
 Nitish Kumar said that before his swearing in, he had proposed during the meeting with BJP President Amit Shah and Bihar BJP in-charge Upendra Yadav that allies should get a place in the Council of Ministers on the basis of numbers, but this did not happen
 nahin chahie mantri padnitish ne kaha ki vah chaahate the ki bihar main endie ke ghatak dalon kii sankhya aadhaar par yaa phir rashtriya str par endie ke ghatak dalon ke sankhya ke aadhaar par mantri parishad kaa bantwaaraa hona chahie tha
 Nitish said that giving the JDU a ministerial status in a symbolic way has led to other party leaders
 isliye party ne faisla kiya ki hamen ek bhi mantri pad nahin chahie
 However, Nitish while giving a scathing speech to the BJP also said that he is not disappointed at the lack of respectable numbers in the Modi cabinet but his party stands with the BJP
 bijepi jaisaa chaahe vaisaa faisla karabijapi se naaraaz nitish ne yah bhi elaan kar diya ki bhavishya main agar narendra modi cabinet kaa vistaar hota he or unki party ko mantrimandal main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa miltaa he, to bhi unki party isamen shaamil nahin hogi
 It is clear that Nitish has given a clear indication that he is hurt due to the government not getting a place in the cabinet in the beginning and that he will not do it even if JDU gets a chance to join the Modi government in future
 bijepi par hamalaa karte hue nitish kumaar baar-baar tanj bhi karte rahe or kaha ki is baar unhen prachand bahumat mila he isiilie vah jo chaahe vah faisla kar sakate hai
 Nitish Kumar said, "we do not need symbolic representation
" jab mujhase kaha gaya ki ek mantri jediu ko diya jayega to maine kaha ki hamen nahin chahie
 But i will talk to my party members about this
 jab ham saath hai to hamen kisi bhi tarah kii sankethik hissedari kii jarurat nahin he
 We are not angry with the BJP
 isse pehle jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha tha ki modi mantrimandal main shaamil na hone ke peeche kii vajah naaraazgi nahin he
 The matter is being discussed with Amit Shah
 baatcheet ke baad hi koi faisla liya jayega
 KC Tyagi said that it was wrong to stick to the demand for more ministerial posts
 28 may ko nitish kumaar dilli aae the uske baad unhone amit shah se baatcheet kii
 He said that we have fixed symbolic representation of all the allied parties
 28 may ko nitish kumaar ne isse asahmati jataai ki jediu pratikatmak pratinidhitiv ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 KC Tyagi said, Nitish Kumar took this decision after talking to senior members of the party and the party's parliamentary committee
 jitne bhi party pratinidhi dilli main the, sabane kaha ki pratikatmak pratinidhitiv ke liye party taiyaar nahin he
 Neither Nitish Kumar named RCP Singh nor Kushwaha, nor Lalan Singh
 jab ham pratikatmak pratinidhitiv ke liye taiyaar nahin hai, to kisi kaa naam sujhane kaa sawaal hi nahin
 All the news going on in the media is wrong
 bataa den narendra modi ke shapathgrahan se pehle hi bijepi ke saath jediu kii takaraar saamne ai thi
 In fact, this time the JDU has not taken any ministerial position in the Modi government
 jiske baad janata dal united (JDU) ke netaa kasee tyaagi kaa kahana he ki iskaa asar bihar vidhansabha chunaav par dekhne ko milegaa
 Actually, JDU demanded that there should be three ministers from their quota, but only 1 ministerial position was offered to them by BJP
 nitish kumaar chaahate the ki aaaraseepi singh or lallan singh ko kendriya mantri banaaya jaae or santosh kushvaha ko rajyamantri kaa darja mili
 Nitish Kumar is trying to adjust the caste equation for next year's assembly elections
 lekin aisa ho nahin sakaa

 Tina Sharma, who slammed Aam Aadmi Party supporter Ejaz Khan during a live debate on a TV news channel, said in a special conversation with the web team till date that Ejaz Khan has earned this slap
 unhen ek nahin do thappad padane chahie the
 They encouraged me to take this step
 tina sharma ne kaha, 'channel par dibet ke dauraan ejaj khan mere saath budtamiji karte rahe
 They had no answer to my questions
 vah puure sho ke dauraan sirf hindu-muslim kii baaten kar rahe the
 He was repeatedly saying that you cry about being a woman on every channel
 dibet ke dauraan unhone mujhe mently il kaha
 He said that i am mentally ill, greedy, asking for a ticket from the party
 mujhe besharm or ghatiya tak kaha
 Talking about the incident, Tina Sharma said that the other panellists in the debate were also opposing the way Ejaz Khan interacted
 dibet ke dauraan ejaj khan ko blassout kiya gaya or ankar ne maafee maangane ke liye bhi kaha
 The anchor said that this debate will only go ahead when Ijaz apologizes
 lekin unhone maafee maangane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Even further, the show continued to misbehave
 mere paas ejaj kii bhashaa kaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Tina Sharma said, "I had no choice but to do this (raise my hand)
" maine jo kiya is par mujhe koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 "being a member of the Aam Aadmi Party is not a big deal" Tina Sharma said that i am a member of the Aam Aadmi Party and a social worker
 mere liye aam aadmi party kaa member hona koi badi baat nahin he
 This is a very small thing

 He said that the Aam Aadmi Party's first list for the Lok Sabha elections was entirely based on caste
 janata unke paksh main nahin he
 They will get some votes only on the basis of sentimentality
 logon ko unki asaliyat samaj main aa rahi he
 When Tina Sharma was asked if she would contest the Lok Sabha elections at the behest of the party? So in response he said that he has not thought about it yet
 unhone chunaav ladane ke liye aplai nahin kiya he
 He said, 'at the time when i had to apply, i was standing with Binny against the party
 ' unhone aarope lagaaya ki tikat kise milanaa he, ye pehle se nirdhaarit he
 It was being said that the PAC would decide who to get the ticket
 tikat loktantric tareeke se tay hoga
 But it is all lies
 iske liye koi voting nahin hoti he
 The PAC has not decided on Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar vishwaas ne khud ko hi amethi se ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya he
 He said that women have also been sidelined in this party
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe is party main isliye liya gaya tha kyonki main mukhar netaa hum
 Kejriwal and Yogendra Yadav made me a part of the party by saying the same
 maine sochaa tha ki party main shaamil hokar main apane saamaajik kaary zyada behatar dhang se kar sakati hum
 But this could not happen

 com hindustan main hindu dharm main aasthaa rakhane waalon main shaayad hi aisa koi ghar hoga jahaan devi pujan na hota ho
 The worship of Goddess has different significance from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Arunachal Pradesh to Kutch's run
 or is desh main jitani bhi devi hai or unki upasna kii kahaniyaan hai unka koi na koi sira hinduon kii pramukh kitabon se jaakar jarur miltaa he
 There is no shortage of stories in Hindu scriptures that do not refer to the Goddess of Hindus and their divine powers
 lekin aise kisse bahut kam milte hai, jo deviyon ke patit ho jane yaa phir jane anjaane unase yaa unke saath hue paap kaa ullekh pramukhataa se kiya jaataa ho
 It is not written anywhere in any religion book that no god gives these brides to anyone that men should rule over women
 hindustan hi shaayad wo iklauta mulk bhi he puri duniya main jahaan dev sthalon par devon ke saath saath deviyon kii murtiyon ko bhi shaktishaalee or adarpurvak sthaan pradaan he
 Then the question arises that why this Hindu society is patriarchal? Why did Hindu law holders see women as Kamini? Why did it say that Maya should be avoided? Devdutt Patnaik, a well-known expert in mythological subjects and who brought his research to the readers through writing, wrote his new book in India
 The Goddess not only raised such complex questions in the five forms of eternal femininity
 balki hinduon kii manyata praapt pustakon ke madhyam se unke uttar bhi talashne kii koshish kii he
 From the research of mythology and legends, Devadatta Patnaik has been successful in concluding that all the goddesses worshiped in this country have originated from five major forms

 But in this sultry summer of July filled with competitive exams, instead of preparing in the room, these students are turning to the plinth next to the statue of Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee near Batra Cinema

 inaki maang he ki sangh lok seva ayog (upiessi) kii lok seva kii praarambhik pariksha se civil services kaaman aptitude test (siset) hataa diya jaae, kyonki jab 2011 main siset lagu kiya gaya to uske baad se hi iees pariksha main safal hone vaale hindi or baaki bhartiya bhashaai madhyam ke chaatro kii sankhya main tej giravat ai he
 When the students have been doing this struggle and how deep their pain is, talk about the cassette before exploring the pulse
 darasal, 2011 se pehle tak civil sarvice kii prilims pariksha main do prashnptr hote the—pehla parchaa chaatr ke mukhya vishay kaa hota tha or doosraa parchaa saamaanya adhyayan kaa
 In 2011, the prescription of the main subject was removed and the form of cassette was given

 Apart from this, the Hindi translation of questions is so complex that even Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityan can hardly understand it
 ” puraane parchon par najar daalen to isamen 'tablet’ computer kaa ngkshahadi anuwaad 'goli computer’, paryaavaran ke maamle main prachlit angreji turm 'go and no go jone’ kaa anuwaad 'haa yaa nahin avadharana’ or 'star parformar’ kaa anuwaad 'nayakkarta’ jaise abujh shabdon ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Taking the matter further, Abhishek Kashyap, who is associated with the movement, argues, "where half of the questions are not understood by the Hindi people, the qualifying marks are kept at 70 percent in that set
 yani bhartiya bhashaaon or gramin chaatro ko iees na banane dene kaa pukhta intjaam kiya gaya he
 Arun S

 In the report presented in August 2012, the committee had said, "the Ccet Form is benefiting English Medium candidates from urban backgrounds and it is harming students from rural backgrounds
" ”cameti ne is parche ke iity or iiem vaale chaatro ko phayda pahunchane vaala bhi bataaya tha
 However, the same committee had also made controversial recommendations, which had caused a ruckus in March last year
 angreji ke anivaary prashnptr or bhartiya bhashaaon ko nazarandaaj karne vaali in siforeeshon kaa tab tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je
 Jayalalithaa and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan protested

 In this case UPSC is completely silent
 ab jaraa samasya kii jad ko aankadon kii najar se dekhte hai—2008, 2009 or 2010 main prilims pariksha main angreji madhyam ke chaatr kramash: 51

 5 fisadi or 62
 2 per cent were successful, while the success figures of Hindi students were 45, 42 and 35 per cent during this period
 ab dekhie 2011 main siset lagu hone ke baad kya hua?2011 main angreji ke 83 fisadi or 2012 main 82 fisadi chaatr prilims main kaamyaab rahe, vahiin hindi se kramash: mahaj 15 or 16 fisadi chaatr hi prilims pariksha kwalifai kar paae
 In other languages, 14, 117 and 98 students of Kannada, Telugu and Tamil medium respectively were successful in the 2008 prelims, which was reduced to 5, 29 and 14 students in 2011
 jab prilims main hi chantai ho gai to antim parinaam to niraashajanak hona hi tha
 The result is that while 222 civil service officers were made through Hindi medium in 2009, according to the data received so far in 2013, only 26 Hindi mediums have qualified the public service examination
 in aankadon par pratikriya vyakt karte hue purv iares adhikari or ab supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta ne kaha, ''maine hindi mukhya vishay ke saath upiessi kaa pariksha paas kii thi

 But the fact is also that in this general election, the entire Hindi belt which fell on the charisma of Narendra Modi, the same Hindi fight returned from Modi's frame

 Chittaranjan recalls, "early 3

 to vahiin 1989, 2004, 2009 or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne apana jhanda gada
 In this sense, Jalore seat has been continuously occupied by BJP for the last 3 times

 This seat was a Congress stronghold due to being reserved for Scheduled Castes

 In the recent assembly elections, BJP has won 6 of these 8 assemblies
 jabaki 1 seat par congress or 1 seat par nirdaleey ummidavaar jeeta
 In this sense, the BJP has a heavy upper hand in the current political equation of jalore-sirohi

 Jayanthi Natarajan, who was the environment minister during the UPA government, has resigned from the Congress
 unhone saath hi ek bada khulaasa bhi kiya, jisamen unhone rahul gandhi par gambhir aarope lagaae
 According to the English newspaper 'the Hindu', Natarajan wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi, in which she said that she was under pressure from Rahul Gandhi for not giving green signal to many environmental projects
 unhone likhaa ki unke istifa dene ke baad rahul gandhi ke daphtar kii ore se unke khilaaf media main prachaar kiya gaya
 It also indicated that Rahul Gandhi was involved in important decisions during the UPA government, while the Congress always denied it
 is chitthee main jayanti natarajan ne yah bhi sanket die hai ki chunaav se 100 din pehle unhen hataaya gaya tha, jabaki congress ne us vakt ye daawa kiya tha ki unhen party ke liye kaam karne ke liye sanghathan main bheja ja rahaa he
 Jayanthi Natarajan, who was the Minister of State (independent Charge) for the Ministry of Forest and Environment from 2011 to 2013 in the UPA Government, has made serious allegations against Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, janyati natarajan par aarope laga tha ki unki dhilaai ke chalate vikaas ke kai projects shuru nahin ho paae
 During the Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also alleged that the files are blocked due to Jayanti Tax, but Jayanthi Natarajan wrote in a letter about the same Narendra Modi that the Congress had conspired to implicate Narendra Modi in Snoopgate
 vaise, sawaal timming ko lekar ho saktaa he jabaki dilli main chunaav hai or rahul gandhi prachaar main jute hai to november main likhi is chitthee ko is samay kyon li kiya gaya? It is worth mentioning that Jayanthi Natarajan is accused of not giving the go ahead to 35 such important projects, which range from thousand to five thousand crores

 He is an international terrorist

 Asked about the pressure on Dawood on the issue of cooperation with Pakistan, he said that all the necessary documents related to Dawood have been given to Pakistan

 unhone kaha, 'ISIS se koi khatra nahin he
 Along with security alerts, Muslims of the country are also against this organization
 desh kaa muslim samudaay unhen aisa karne nahin degaa
 'give these threats from terrorist organizations' In a video recently surfaced, Fahd Tanveer Sheikh, an ISIS, Indian jihadist and an engineering student from Thane, had issued a warning that he would avenge the Babri Masjid demolition and the killing of Muslims in the country

 lekhak, raajnneetijna shashi tharur kii pustak 'why i AM a HINDU' angreji main kaaphi charchit rahi
 Recently Yugank Dhir translated it into Hindi, which was published by Vani Prakashan
 yah kitaab ‘main hindu kyon hum’ ke naam se chhapi he
 The release of the 365-page book was held in a grand manner in Delhi, which was attended by many well-known writers, journalists and politicians from the capital
 sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye isi pustak kaa khaas ansh
 The first challenge was linked to the definition
 ‘hindu’ shabd kaa arth sirf ek dharm tak simit nahin he
 In many languages, including French and Persian, the word 'indian' or 'hindu' is used for Indian
 multah ‘hindu’ kaa arth sindhu yaa ‘inds’ nadi ke paar ke logon tak simit tha
 Now this river falls in Islamic Pakistan, which further complicates the situation
 kisi bhi bhartiya bhashaa main ‘hindu’ shabd kaa koi astitv nahin tha, jab tak ki videshiyon dwaara is shabd ke prayog ne bharatiyon ko aatm-paribhaasha ke liye ek shabd nahin de diya
 In other words, the word with which Hindus define themselves is not their own coined word, but is a word adopted from others
 (kai log ek alag shabd ‘sanathan dharm’ kaa bhi prayog karte hai, jisaki charchaa ham aage karenge
 ) Punyathi Special: Not To Be Forgotten 'kaal-katha' and Kamatanath
 Thus, 'hinduism' is the name given to the indigenous religion of India by foreigners
 iske daayre main bahut-se siddhanth or dharmik vyavhaar aate hai, jo ‘panthewaad’ se lekar ‘anishvarwad’ tak or ‘avtaron’ main aasthaa se lekar ‘jatvaad’ main vishwaas tak faile hue hai, parantu inamen se kisi main bhi ek hindu ke liye koi anivaary mulmantra nahin he
 There is no dogma in our religion
 yah nissandeh ek anokhi baat he
 a Catholic is Catholic because he considers Jesus the god-son, who sacrificed his life for humanity
 vah ‘nishkalank garbhadhaaran’ or ‘virgin mairi’ main vishwaas rakhata he; carch main sweekaarokti detaa he; or pope or padri ke maargdarshan ke anusaar chalata he
 a Muslim believes that there is no God but Allah and 'muhammad' is his prophet
 ek yahudee apane torah ko maanata he, to ek parsi fire temple main puja karata he
 a Sikh considers Gurugranthasahib to be uppermost and revered
 hindu dharm main inamen se kisi kaa bhi koi samatuly paryaay nahin he
 There is no mandatory condition to be a Hindu
 or to or, ishwar main vishwaas bhi nahin
 Fahmida Riaz: The poet who was called India's agent in Pakistan, i grew up in a Hindu family
 hamaare ghar main hameshaa ek puja-ghar hota tha, jahaan vibhinn devi-devataaon ke chitra hamaare purvajon ke kuch puraane chitron ke saath shelf or diwaar kii shobhaa badhaayaa karte the
 Around them, the ashes of incense sticks burned daily by my faithful parents were scattered
 main pehle kisi pustak main likh chukaa hum ki apane pita ko puja karte dekhte hue kis tarah mere man main dharmikata kii bhaavana upajani shuru hui thi
 Every morning, after taking a bath, my father wrapped a towel in his waist and used to chant in the house of worship without combing his wet hair, but he never asked me to stand with him
 yah is baat kaa udhaaharan tha ki dharm ke bare main hindu ‘vichaar’ yah tha ki yah ek purnataya nijee maamla tha
 This worship was just between you and your divine symbol
 ek hindu ke rup main mujhe apana satya khud khojna tha

 yani 25 se 27 rupee kaa genhu garib tak do rupee main detii he
 So that the poor could eat
 chaaval bhi centre sarkaar 30 se 32 rupye main kharidkar garib ko sirf teen rupye main garib ko pahunchaata he

 That means seats will be extended
 sabakuch isi se thik ho jayega yah daawa na mainen kiya na karuunga

 According to the study, the main reason for this is our irregular routine
 iske alaava iske kai duusare kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 One of the most important reasons is body posture
 baithne kaa tarika bhi hamaare sharir ke kai hisson ko prabhavit karata he
 This simply means that by improving the way we sit, we can get relief from daily body pens
 isamen sabase mahatpavurna he kursi par baithne kaa tarika

 According to the Sydney School of Public Health Study, this problem is the highest in Asia and Africa
 agar aapkaa baithne kaa tarika sahi nahin he to aapaki peeth or gardan main dard ho saktaa he

 aapako ye jaanakar aashcharya ho saktaa he ki sahi poshchar main baithne se tanaav bhi kam hota he
 In such a situation, the question arises that what should be the correct posture? Whenever you are sitting in a chair, try to have your back perfectly straight
 aapke kuulhe puri tarah kursi kii back ko choote hue hon
 If you wish, you can keep a towel in the back to create balance
 baithne ke dauraan aapke ghutane aapke kulhon kii tulana main kuch oonchai par hone chahie
 Also, there should be equal distance between your chair and the table
 aapke teble or kursi kii oonchai bhi bahut mahatv rakhti he
 Along with all these things, special care should also be taken that from time to time you keep getting up from your chair
 der tak ek hi poshchar main baithe rahanaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he

 On the other hand, effective efforts are not being made by the forest department to control the fire

 In Uttarakhand, the fire has created such a furore for the last 19 days that there are many problems in the journey route
 vahiin mausam vibhaag ne bhi saaf kar diya he ki taapmaana or badhegaa
 Which will increase the risk of fire
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki aane vaale dinon main aag kii ghatnaon main or ijapha ho saktaa he
 The hills of Devprayag, considered the first Prayag in Uttarakhand, are also not untouched by the wrap of fire
 chaar dham yatra maarg ke jangal jal rahe hai
 More than 100 people living on the other side of the hill are trapped in the village due to the fire, which has no one to take care of
 jab aag bujhegi tabhi wo mukhya maarg tak aane main sakasham ho paaenge
 Also, it has become difficult to see because of the smoke
 sthaneey log van vibhaag kii laaparvaahee se naaraaz hai kyonki van vibhaag kaa koi bhi karmchaaree vahaan aag par kaabo paane ke liye maujuud nahin he

 The story of the film is everything it needs

 Regardless of the film's screen and at the box office, one thing is certain, Prachi is truly a makeover

 Narendra Modi was to rally in Bihar for the first time after a long time
 phir kuch aisa hua jisane soobe kii siyasat ko badalakar rakh diya
 There were bomb blasts at the rally site itself
 sthiti gambhir thi par koi apni jagah se hilaa nahin
 The people in the field were eager to hear Modi
 chaaron ore 'modi
 
 
 Slogans of 'modi'
 phir modi ne apane sambodhan se saaf kar diya ki unke agenda main bihar sabase upar he
 This rally became historic and perhaps on the same day the foundation of new politics was laid in the province
 bijepi kaa gathbandhan jediu se tut gaya tha isliye party ke paas wo jaateey sameekaran nahin tha jiske dam par bihar jeeta ja sake
 Anyway, they are already seen as a party of the forward
 aise main daliton ko kaise saath laayaa jaae? aakhir pichhadon ko agado ke saath kaise laayaa jaae? kaise vishwaas jagaaya jaae ki ab bijepi ke agenda main sirf savarna nahin, dalit or pichde bhi hai
 This strategy was supported by the BJP by coming together with Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Loksamata Party
 2002 dangon ke kaaran endie chhodane vaale ramvilas paswan ek baar phir waapas aa gaye the
 How much BJP benefited from this alliance will be analyzed later

 bjp's agenda was clear
 unke nishane par nitish kumaar the, jinhone modi ko lekar bijepi ke saath 17 saal purana rishta tod diya
 Gradually Nitish started becoming weak
 unke vikaas ke agenda kaa asar bihar kii janata par kam hone laga

 With just three weeks left for the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has announced to begin the second round of campaigning
 26 march se shuru hone vaale is duusare daur main narendra modi desh bhar kii 295 loksabhaa siton par 185 vijay reliyaan karenge
 It is being started from Jammu
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh ke alaava laalkrishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, murali manohar joshi, nitin gadakari, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh, vasundhara raaje sindhiya or manohar parrikar bhi alag-alag jagahon par bharat vijay reliyon main hissaa lenge
 In order to connect directly with the common people, BJP has changed the way of these rallies
 matadaataaon ko reliyon main bulaane ke liye unhen vyaktigat taur par nimantran patr bheja jayega
 Party workers are being given a kit for this
 is kit main vyaktigat nimantran patr, narendra modi kaa sandesh, vibhinn muddon par logon se suzav maangane ke liye namo suzav patr or namo for piem fund ke liye jaruri saamaan hoga
 BJP is trying to separate Bharat Vijay rallies from other rallies
 reliyon se logon ko jodne ke alaava raily khatm hone ke baad bhi modi kaa sandesh aam logon tak pahunche, iske liye sidi vitarit kii jaaengi
 Social media will also be used to convey Modi's message to voters of every constituency and invite him to the rally
 is dauraan logon ko upie ke khilaaf chargeshit bhi di jaaegi, jisamen vibhinn paimaanon par upie sarkaar ke das saal ke kaamkaaj kii samiksha hogi
 Here in Silicon Valley, we have a few people trying to solve a riddle for a long time: Why is India a country of rich talent rich people poor? Not only Indian scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, but also the leaders and bureaucrats of India are among the most brilliant people in the world
 to phir aisa kyon he ki jab aarthik nitiyaan banane or lagu karne kii baat aati he to hindustan khud apane hi khilaaf gol karata rahaa he?hindustan ne kuch shandaar kamyaabiyaan hasil kii hai jinhone desh kaa kayapalat kiya or duniya ke liye misaal kaayam kin
 For example, the Green Revolution, due to which India grows more than it needs to feed its one billion plus population
 antariksh or atomi urja program ke kshetra main uski uplabdhiyon ne beman se hi par duniya kii izzat hasil kii he
 The innovative Aadhaar project and the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) are evidences of Hindustani understanding
 phir baaki har maamle main ham kamatar kyon sabit hote rahete hai? kya ham in shandaar uplabdhiyon se sikh sakate hai or aisi kamyaabi kii taraf le jane vaale karkon ko duusare kshetron main doharaa sakate hai?sari uplabdhiyon main ek gauratlab baat yah he ki inaki aguai kshetra ke nami visheshgyon ne kii thi or sabko ek hi palade par rakhkar tolane vaale afasarshahon ko inase itani dur rakhaa gaya tha ki koi adangha na laga paaen
 The leaders of India have been dependent on them for making policies, while they are not fit for this work
 jab bhi is netaa varg ne aarthik nitiyaan banane ke kaam main khud ko shaamil kiya—masalan 1991 kaa aarthik udaarikaran, jisane afasarshahi ko arthvyavastha ke khaase bade hisse ke liye phaltu bana diya—nattejey shandaar rahe hai
 The same is true of the freedom of telecom rules, liberalization of financial sector, removal of civil aviation from the tightening of rules, policy changes in the auto sector and so on
 saamaanya prashasan, swasthya, pratiraksha, electronics, shiksha jaise vibhinn kshetron main hindustan kii zyaadaatar nitiyon ko aaj bhi 'sab dhan baaise paseri' maanane vaali afasarshahi niyantrit karti he
 It prepares and implements a full set of policies
 kendriya rajmarg, jahajrani or jal sansaadhan mantri nitin gadakari sareekhe mantri is prakriya main gaharaai se shaamil hone ke naate apwaad hai
 And this has been the practice of every government since the independence of India
 nateezaah kahar
 This bureaucratic model of governance inherited from the British Raj had to be followed
 isaki banaavat hi aisi he ki is kism kii afasarshahi ehtiyaat baratane or puraani najiron ke nakshekadam par chalane ko taiyaar rahati he, jisase fouran or teji se kaam nahin karne ko badhaava miltaa he or loktantr main log josh or lagan se bhari jis pratikriya kii ummid karte hai, usamen or is lihaaj se nae samaadhaan talashne main oonche maanakon se bahut neeche he
 Putting every aspect of government policies and implementation into such bureaucratic steps is to adopt a narrow way and strangle the progress of India
 unamem kisi bhi niti ke bhavi nateezon kii samaj hi nahin he
 Worse, the incentive or promotion structures are mismatched, so the bureaucracy never pays the price for poor implementation of policies, but the country and the ruling leaders
 yah rujhaan baar-baar 'satta virdohi bhaavana' vaale chunaavon main jhalkata he jo rajya or centre kii sarkaron ko ulat dete hai or aisa yahaan kisi bhi duusare bade desh se zyada hota he
 Take, for example, the tricky and tricky start of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017
 bhaajapa sarkaar ko vyapaariyon or chote kaarobaariyon kii takalif or ghabrahat se nibatna padaa
 No officer was punished for this
 khushhaali or dhan-daulat navachaar yaa navonmesh ke peeche-peeche chalati he
 Take today's four most innovative and therefore profitable industries: semiconductor, aeronautics, medical devices and medicines
 hindustan ne inamen kitna yogadan kiya he? jiro
 In the semiconductor industry around the world, a significant percentage of Indians hold significant positions, yet the contribution of India is only cipher
 har technology mantri ne silicon vaili kii tirthayatra kii he, acchhee baaten kahi hai or phir bhi beete 30 saal main kuch na hua
 Meanwhile, India's electronics import bill is going to be much larger than its oil imports
 aisa kyon he ki hindustan ek asardaar semiconductor niti banane main lagaataar naakaam ho gaya? isliye ki niti nirmaataa sab dhan baaise paseri vaale afasarshah hai jinke paas is kshetra kaa uthlaa or satahi gyaan he
 It takes time for a sharp bureaucrat to learn the science of the growth of a complex global industry and by the time they get some understanding, the next deployment time comes
 agle mantralay main ve bilkul pehle hi din sabase oonchi nirnaayak bhoomika akhriyaar kar lete hai or kam jaankaree se las faisle lene, un par amal kii sankeern dizin banane or kharaab amal kaa yah chakra doharaaya jaataa rahata he
 None of this means that bureaucrats are not talented, hardworking and honest
 kuch to sachmuch asaadhaaran hai or kaam karke dene kii teji or jarurat mahasoos karte hai, par aise apwaad mahaj apwaad hi hai
 Some bureaucrats are fine, it does not mean to say that the bureaucracy is good as a system and can make the Indian economy work well
 mahaj isliye ki ashok or akbar mahaan samraat the, iskaa yah matlab nahin ki rajshahi adarsh vyavastha thi
 We understand that perhaps there is a solution hidden here
 satta main aane vaali harek sarkaar ko itani chhot honi chahie ki vah nijee kshetra se or naagarik samaaj se 30 ke aasapaas logon ko niyukt kar sake, sansad se unki jaanch-padtaal karwaae or manjuuri le or unhen us sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan afasarshahi ke hisse ke taur par faisle lene kii bhoomikaayen saunpe
 These 'political officers' should not only have the expertise required for their roles but also realize the need to act quickly and support the agenda of the government brought to power by voting
 fouran jo sawaal khadaa hoga, vah apni visheshgyata ke kshetra main niti banane or lagu karne ke kaam se nibatane ke liye ek shaks kii niyukti main hiton ke sambhavit takaraav ko lekar hoga
 In a large country like India, it is always possible to find such talented people who are of such sublime ideas that they can keep the interest of the country above their own interest
 hindustan main oonche naitik aacharan vaale or eemaandaar pratibhashali logon kii koi kami nahin he
 Nandan Nilekani, the visionary and craftsman of the base, did not oblige Infosys, sharing the bonuses of work
 nilekani sareekhe kai peshewar hai, jo mauka diya jaae to desh ke liye mahaan kaam karne kii prerana se ot-prot hai
 It is the responsibility of the party to identify such people and it is the responsibility of the Parliament to investigate them
 or ab tak hamen itnaa to pataa chal hi janaa chahie ki 'purvaagrah mukt' afasarshahi ke myth ko naamanzoor kar saken
 Ask the residents of any state capital about the political inclinations of any bureaucrat, they can tell innumerable stories
 agar logon ne ek sarkaar vishesh ko chunakar satta saunpi he to unhen raaj-kaaj ke ek aise dhaanche kaa haq he jo unki jaruraton or aakankshaon ke prati uttaradaayi ho
 Any political party taking the initiative and taking the lead in this matter will immediately be termed as a party digging the roots of authority and institutional integrity
 hamen aise aaropon se gumraah nahin hona chahie—gahari jaden jamaaye baithi kisi bhi takat kaa swaarth isi main he ki vah kisi bhi badlaav ko aniatik tehra de
 There should be a statutory warning with the status quo that it is harmful to political health
 samooche rajnatik falak ke netaaon ko is badlaav kaa samarthan karnaa chahie

 But the Congress has bluntly told Akhilesh that first you decide within the Samajwadi Party, then we are with you, if sources are to be believed, Akhilesh Yadav has given a message to Rahul Gandhi that the decision within the Samajwadi Party is on the 13th
 Will do, so only after that decision we decide together, it will be better to move forward
 isiilie 10 janvari ko rahul or akhilesh ke bich hone vaali mulaakaat philhal aage bad gai he
 Significantly, on the 13th, the Election Commission will decide whose cycle will be or whose will not be or what will be Akhilesh's motorcycle! Only then will the dialogue with the Congress move forward
 us surat main akhilesh pataa karenge ki kya vahi sapa ke survey sarva he or vahiin sab kuch tay kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is certain that Congress strategists and Akhilesh's lieutenants are agreeing that the date of the announcement of the alliance has been extended
 lekin ahm sawaal yahi he ki kuekhileshaage badhkar faisla karenge yaa phir shivpal or amar singh kii shaktiyon se gire mulaayam kii is baat ko maanenge ki congress se talmail mat karo
 Mulayam says that do not let the Muslims vote in the Congress's court, once gone, our party will suffer in the long run
 vahiin akhilesh kehete hai jab main mukhyamantri banuunga rahul se lambey vakt kaa rishta rakhuunga to siyaasi nuksaan nahin phayda hoga
 In such a situation, everything went according to Akhilesh, then there would be a grand alliance between the Congress, Akhilesh, RLD and all the smaller parties in the group
 lekin mulaayam agar apane bete ko apane paale main laakar yah samajhane main kaamyaab hue ki congress se talmail naa karo tab nai kahani siyasat kii ibaarat likh degi
 However, Akhilesh says about what he has to do, why he will go with Mulayam and we will hold Rahul's hand

 bandini film main apane behtareen abhinay kii chhap chhodane vaali nutan kaa aaj ke hi din janm hua tha
 Superhit heroine Nutan, who gave blockbuster movies for four decades, is not interested in any introduction
 bhartiya cinema main 50 ke dashak kii sabase safal abhinetriyon kii fehrist main nutan kaa naam bhi shumaar tha

 Giriraj said that the BJP has to carefully choose national and state level leaders among only 40 party campaigners and for the Gujarat elections, the party leadership has submitted a list of BJP campaigners to the Election Commission, among them five to seven national leaders while the rest are state level leaders
 
 unhone kaha ki unhen jo jaankaree mili he bihar se party netaaon ke gujarat main chunaav prachaar jane ke liye daravaaje abhi band nahin hue hai or unke saath-saath party ke do sau netaa or kaaryakarta yahaan se baad ke dinon main vahaan jaayenge
 The list of 40 campaigners for party candidates submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission during the Gujarat Assembly elections is not included in the names of Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Muslim faces Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 bhaajapa kii is suchi ko lekar party ke bheetar or raajnneetik galiyare main yah kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki modi ne jaanboojhkar bihar se apane saathiyon ko unke yahaan ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane ke kaaran darkinar kiya he
 It is also being speculated that at the behest of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi and the JD (U), the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he was campaigned by the party leaders for the election in Bihar Assembly elections held last year and 2009 Lok Sabha elections before that
 In return for not calling them

 The ghost of whatsapp Gold is back once again
 2016 main whatsapp gold ko lekar kaaphi viral post aapane dekhi hogi
 Not only this, whatsapp Plus was also very much discussed and it was also fake
 bataaya ja rahaa tha ki company whatsapp ko apgrade karke watsap gold laa rahi he, lekin ye puri tarah se galat tha or ab bhi galat he
 This time also people are posting on whatsapp Gold on social media, which is completely fake and misleading
 micro bloging website twitor or utyub par kuch aise videos bhi mil jaaenge jinamein watsap gold kaa zikr he
 If you have an email or message link to install whatsapp Gold, do not open it
 kyonki yah mailaware yaa virus ho saktaa he
 If you have any link to the feature called whatsapp Gold, report it
 watsap kii taraf se na towatsapagold laayaa gaya he or na hi watsap plus
 Let me tell you that there are two versions of whatsapp - one is the normal one you use and the other is Business whatsapp
 donon hi ek jaise hi hai, lekin bijness acount main veriphication miltaa he ki wo bijness othentic he yaa nahin
 The company communicates with its customers through a business account
 iske alaava kisi tarah kaa watsap nahin he
 a whatsapp message is also going viral, saying 'whatsapp Gold, a video will be launched called Martinelli
 ise na kholen
 It is a virus and will come to your smartphone and you cannot do anything
 aap watsap gold main apgrade na karen kyonki ye virus he
 ' kya aapane kisi dost yaa padosi se poocha he ki vah rose shaam ko hindi news channelon par hindu muslim dibet kyon dekhtaa he
 Before he sees such a debate, he sets out to join the crowd of rioters, pay the duty of friendship and neighbor
 usase puuchhie ki kahin tum hindu muslim dibet to nahin dekhte ho
 The craze of showing such a debate has started on the news channel
 unase poochne se koi phayda nahin isliye aap rail main chalate hue, bas main chalate hue, bazaar main chaay kii dukaan par apane saath vaale se zarur puuchhen ki kya aap news channelon par hindu muslim dibet dekhte hai
 This is a project
 noujvaan doctor bananaa chahta he, hindu muslim project unhen dangai bananaa chahta he
 The only purpose of this project is that you start being normalized by the words of hate
 ghar baithe-baithe dangai maansikta ke ho jaaen or jab bihar ke sitamarhi main ek 83 saal kaa bujurg zainul ansaari cycle se utaar kar maar diya jaae, jala diya jaae to aapako fark hi na pade

 We saw many farmers' movements in the last several years
 29-30 is andolan ke centre main do mudde pramukh rup se rahe
 The prices of crops should be given rightly and the system of selling the crops should be corrected
 modi sarkaar ne nunatam samarthan mulya ko apane vaade ke hisaab se laagat se dedh guna dene kaa daawa karti he lekin tathy kuch duusare bhi hote hai
 Keep watching Harish Damodaran's report on the minimum support price in Indian Express
 sarkaar jo kahati he, usase alag pataa chalegaa
 Our colleague Anurag Dwari has reported on the government price and the gap between farmers
 kisaanon kaa long march mumbai bhi pahunchaa or dilli bhi kai baar aayaa
 What the government has done, whether the opposition parties who claim to stand with the farmers, have considered the farmers as something more or different from the government
 kya chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh ke ghoshnapatron ko dekhte hue aisa lagata he ki congress kisaanon ke masale ko behatar samaj rahi he or sulajhane kaa koi thos daawa kar rahi he
 What is the claim in the bjp's manifesto, is it again a claim or what is new that the BJP could not do while running the government in these states for 15 years
 kya jo vah daawa kar rahi he in 15 saal ke dauraan main kisaanon ke liye nahin kar sakati thi
 Chhattisgarh BJP has 2013 and 2018 manifesto in front of us
 ab ham dekh sakate hai ki bhaajapa ne kisaanon ke liye kya vaade tab kiye the, kya nae ghoshnaptr main unke puure hone kii jaankaree he, nae ghoshnaptr main nayaa vaada kya he
 In 2013, the BJP promised to introduce a minimum support price of 2100 paddy
 300 rupee prati quintal bonus denge
 Every single grain of farmers would have bought paddy
 kisaanon ko kisaani hetu byaaz mukt rin dene kaa vaada tha
 Will encourage organic agriculture
 paanch saal main chhattisgarh ko dugdh utpaadan main sarplus state banane kaa lakshya he
 ' kya chhattisgarh main 2013-18 ke bich kisaanon ko bonus milakar 2400 prit quintal kaa bhav mila he? is vakt chhattisgarh main dhan ke liye 1750 rupee prati quintal diya jaataa he
 300 is given as a bonus
 is tarah se kisaanon ko ek quintal dhan kaa 2050 rupaya hi hota he
 It is neither 2400 nor 2100
 kya kisaanon ko bonus miltaa he, kitne kisaanon ko bonus mila he
 In the Business Standard dated 5 November 2018, r Krishna Das reports that a bonus of Rs 300 per quintal has been announced in Chhattisgarh this year
 vaada to 2013 main dene kaa tha, kya pehle bhi 300 rupaya bonus diya gaya yaa sirf chunavi saal main 300 rupaya bonus dene kaa elaan hua
 Are farmers getting a bonus of Rs 300 per quintal this year too
 2018 ke ghoshnaa patr main bijepi ne bataaya he ki bijepi sarkaar ne 15 saal main dhan or bonus raashi milakar kisaanon ko 76,000 karod die hai
 That is, every year spent 5066 crore on the purchase of paddy
 kul krishi kaa bajet hi he 2017-18 1887 karod rupee
 Farming budget 183 in 2003–4
 98 karod tha
 It is written that the number of irrigation pumps in the state has increased from 72000 to 5 lakhs and loans have been provided to the farmers without interest
 bijepi ne kaha he ki 7
 3 lakh farmers have availed interest free loan
 iske liye rajya sarkaar ne 184 karod kaa anudaan diya he
 In December 2017, the Home Minister of Chhattisgarh replied in the assembly that 1344 farmers have committed suicide in the last two and a half years
 is baar bijepi ne vaada kiya he ki 'kisaanon ko bina byaaz kaa rin diya jayega
 Proper arrangement for procurement of paddy and maize at the minimum support price of farmers, bonus to farmers at Rs 300 per quintal
 sabhi mandiyon ko i-naam se joda jayega
 100 percent trade will be ensured in e-name
 27 zilon main gramin krishi bazaar kii sthapana kii jaaegi
 ' har zile main cold storage banane kii baat kahi gai he
 How many districts have cold storage built, is not known
 60 saal se upar kii umr ke laghu or seemaant kisaanon or bhoomihin krishi mazaduron ko 1000 rupee kii masik pension di jaaegi
 Is it any different, has it not been given earlier, what was the amount of pension at that time
 2013 ke ghoshnaa patr main bhi tha ki chhattisgarh ko dugdh utpaadan main sarplus state banaaenge
 The 2018 manifesto states that the Dairy Revolution Campaign will be launched
 2013 ke vaade kaa kya hua
 Did Chhattisgarh become a surplus state in milk production? 2013 main bijepi ne kaha tha ki chhattisgarh ko krishi rajdhani banaaenge, kya aisi koi rajdhani bani, or ye kahaan he
 Chhattisgarh is not among the top five states in 2018
 chhattisgarh main congress kaa vaada dekh lete hai
 The debt of the farmers will be waived within ten days of the formation of the government
 yah saaf nahin he ki karza maaf karne kii sharten kya hongi, kis raashi tak kaa karza maaf hoga
 The farmers' outstanding paddy of two years will be made in bonus installments
 dhan kii kharid kii nunatam dar 2500 prati quintal, makka ke liye 1700 rupee prati quintal, soyabean kii kharid kii nunatam dar 3500 rupee prati quintal, ganna kii kharid kii nunatam dar 355 rupee prati quintal he, chanaa kii kharid kii nunatam dar 4700 rupee prati quintal he
 From the crops whose minimum support price was released by the central government in July, we have seen in the Congress manifesto that whether the Congress is promising higher prices
 dhan kaa kul nunatam samarthan mulya 1750 rupee prati quintal he
 The Congress has promised 2500 per quintal in Chhattisgarh
 centre sarkaar ne makka ke liye 1700 rupee prati quintal bhav tay kiya he
 The Congress promises to give Rs 1700 per quintal in Chhattisgarh
 centre sarkaar ne soyabean ke liye 3399 rupee prati quintal kaa bhav rakhaa he
 Congress has promised a minimum support price of 3500 rupees per quintal of soyabean
 madhya pradesh main congress ne kaha he ki sabhi kisaanon kaa 2 lakh kaa karza maaf hoga
 Will not sell below support price in mandis
 gehun, dhan, jowar, makka, soyabean sarson, kapaas jaise kai fasalon par bonus degi
 Congress has talked about new crop insurance
 fasal beemaa kii ikai khet rahegaa
 If farmers want to live separately then they can be different
 bina karz liye kheti karne vaale bhi fasal beemaa se judenge
 On the recommendation of Gram Sabha, farmers will get the benefit of crop insurance
 tippaniyan Congress has launched Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel Kisan Putra Swavalamban Yojana
 kisi ne notice nahin kiya ki congress ke ghoshnaptr main gau mutr hi nahin, sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke naam par ek yojana bhi aa gai he
 Under this, unemployed youth living in villages will be given loans at a cheaper rate for work like animal husbandry dairy
 unhen 1 karod tak kaa rin dilaayenge or sinchai kar main chhot denge, ve apana utpaada kahin bhi bech sakenge or mandi kar nahin lagegaa
 Congress has another promise
 dugdh utpaadak sangh ke madhyam se dugdh utpaadakon ko 5 rupee prati litre bonus denge
 The Congress has also promised 1000 monthly pension to farmers above 60 years of Madhya Pradesh like the BJP in Chhattisgarh
 hamane sari baaten to yahaan nahin likhi he lekin in ghoshnaa patron ko padhate hue kya yah samajha ja saktaa he ki kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar congress or bijepi kuch thos samaadhaan pesh kar rahi hai
 Their understanding is expanding
 hamane pichley kai saalon main kisaanon ke kai andolan dekhe
 29–30 Two issues figure prominently at the center of this movement
 fasalon kaa sahi daam diya jaae or fasal bikne kii vyavastha sahi kii jaae
 The Modi government claims the MSP to be one and a half times the cost as promised, but the facts are different
 indian express main nunatam samarthan mulya ko lekar aap harish damodaran kii report dekhte rahiye
 What the government says will be different from what it says
 hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne hi sarkari mulya or kisaanon ke bich kii khai ko lekar report kii he
 The farmers' long march also reached Mumbai and Delhi also came many times
 sarkaar ne jo kiya wo kiya, kya kisaanon ke saath khadey hone kaa daawa karne vaale vipakshi dalon ne kisaanon ko sarkaar se kuch zyada yaa alag samajha he
 Looking at the manifestos of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, it seems that the Congress is understanding the issue of farmers better and is making a solid claim to resolve it
 bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr main jo daawa he wo phir aasamaani daawa he yaa aisa kya nayaa he jo in rajyon main 15 saal se sarkaar chalaate hue bijepi nahin kar pai
 What she is claiming she could not do for farmers during these 15 years
