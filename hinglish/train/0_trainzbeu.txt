 The Bombay High Court has granted bail to 3 accused of murder

 It is for this reason that a citizen snatches away all his constitutional armor

 The language of the High Court judge suggests that they are giving exemption to the accused in the murder case, justifying the abetment in the name of religion

 'dangal' film main abhinay karne vaali zaayra wasim ne jammu kashmir kii mukhyamantri se mulaakaat kii or soshal media par tasviir post kar di ki mahabuuba mufti kashmir kii role model hai
 Then a section of Kashmir erupted against Zaira
 internet par trol karne laga matlab unhen dharm ke naam par laanatein bhejne laga, yahaan tak ki bharat kaa agent bhi kah diya gaya
 Zaira was obviously upset and removed his picture with Mehbooba Mufti
 maafee bhi maangi ki 16 saal kii umr main duniya ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai, lihaaza unki galatiyon ko maaf kar diya jaae
 Many prominent and unknown people like former Chief Ministers Omar Abdullah, Javed Akhtar, Anupam Kher and Aamir Khan came forward in support of Zaira
 aamir ne likhaa he ki maine zaayra kaa bayaan padhaa he
 i want to tell Zaira that we are all with you
 zaayra bharat hi nahin, puure vishwa ke liye role model he
 Zaira again wrote that she does not understand how these are national news
 maine na kisi ko aahat kiya he or na hi mujhe kisi ne majaboor kiya
 Mehbooba was praising Zaira, the youth of the same Kashmir, before meeting Mufti
 yah ek tathy he ki zaayra ke kilaaf raajnneetik kaarnon se sibar hamale kiye gaye
 It is also a fact that in these attacks, she was targeted by taking the name of Islam, which she was scared or backed away
 magar ek tathy or he
 The youth of the same Kashmir were also celebrating the success of Zaira till before meeting Mehbooba Mufti
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki usee kashmir ke noujvaan sibar hamale ke baad bhi zaayra ke samarthan main aage aae or uskaa bachaav kar rahe the
 Still done and still doing
 vithkashmir dot com par mohammad faisal or kizir hamsafraani ne likhaa he ki usee kashmir kaa ek hissaa zaayra se nafrat karne waalon ke kilaaf awaz uthaa rahaa he magar wo braking news nahin he
 The Kashmiris were so excited about 'dangal' that Kashmiri Pir came to Jammu from Panjal to watch the film
 hameshaa kii tarah netaa log bhi ek kii kamyaabi ko hathiyaane ke liye photo khinchane lage
 The events of the past year have led to the loss of credibility of mainstream leaders
 isliye netaa prayaas kar rahe the ki yuvaaon main sandesh jaae ki ve unka khyaal karte hai
 The cyber bullying that has happened to Zaira is not good and cyber bully has not received much support either
 vithkashmir dot com par kai logon ke twit hai jisamen zaayra kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 Mohammad Faisal has tweeted that let Zaira be Zaira, Kashmiris love him
 javed parsa ne zaayra ke saath apni tasviir post kii he or neshnal media or netaaon kii aalochana karte hue likhaa he ki sirf ek pahalu ko badha chadha kar dikhaaya gaya
 Many Kashmiri youths have criticized both the Internet trolls and the media a lot
 un kattarpathiyon kii bhi aalochana kii he jo zaayra ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai, uske kilaaf nafrat failaa rahe hai
 Sardar Naseer Ali Khan has also posted his picture with Zaira and said that he made a cake named Dangal, celebrated Zaira's success and also ate the cake
 hedline yah bhi ho sakati thi ki kattarpathiyon ke kilaaf zaayra ke samarthan main kashmiri noujvaan aage aae
 Whether communalism or fundamentalism is in the name of any religion, it is against women, many girls have stopped writing on social media for fear of these people
 sonam kapur, neha dhoopiya, sonakshi sinha, kavita krishnan or barkhaa dutt jaisi kai mahilaon kaa trol ne charitra hanan kiya he
 These people fight, but many girls retreat instead of this fight
 zaayra ke maamle ko lekar ek tabaka un logon kaa trol karne laga jo bahusankhyak sampradayikta ke kilaaf awaz uthaate rahe hai
 It was written about Aamir Khan's silence, though Aamir has now spoken
 anuraag kashyap ke peeche trol yani gaali-daste ne hamalaa kar diya
 Anurag also said in retaliation that he is not afraid, will face the troll
 anuraag se sawaal karne vaale ye log aksar tabhi sawaal karte hai jab inhen alpsankhyak sampradayikta se apane liye kuch khuraaq milti he ki dekho hameen ko kehete hai, unako kuch nahin kehete
 Every kind of communalism remains silent about its court, taking advantage of the other
 sirf sampradayikta ke khel main hi ye niyam he ki doosraa bura he to hamen bhi bura hone kaa haq he
 Now come to another matter
 bambe hoicourt ne hatya ke 3 aropiyon ko zamaanat di he
 What is written in the reasons of this surety should be taken cognizance of
 yah vahi kaaran he jo ek naagarik se uske tamaam sanvaidhanik kavach chin lete hai
 Three people have been given bail in connection with the 2014 killing of Mohsin Sheikh in Pune
 hai court kii jaj kii bhashaa se lagata he ki ve dharm ke naam par uksaane ko jaays bataate hue hatya ke maamle main aaropee ko chhot de rahi hai
 On 2 June 2014, Hindu Rashtra Sena held a resistance meeting in Pune
 fasebuk par kisi ne shivaji maharaj kii or shiv sena ke sansthaapak netaa divangat bal thakare kii chhavi ke saath kisi ne chhedchhad kii thi, usee ke kilaaf hindu raashtra sena ne virodh kiya tha
 No one knows who posted this on Facebook, but returning from that meeting, the accused allegedly attacked Mohsin and Riyaz Sheikh with hockey sticks and sticks
 donon hi iti ejeeniyar the or raat kaa khaanaa khaane ja rahe the
 Riyaz escaped but Mohsin was killed
 tippaniyan In the same case, these three accused were caught and what has been written while giving them bail is like this - Transcript of Dhananjay Desai's inflammatory speech shows that he instigated the feeling of religious discrimination
 aavedak yaa aropiyon kii nirdosh mohison ke kilaaf nijee shatruta jaisi koi or manshaa nahin thi
 The mistake of the deceased is that he belongs to another religion
 main is baat ko aaropee ke haq main maanati hum
 Not only this, the accused or the applicant has no criminal past
 aisa prathit hota he ki dharm ke naam unhen uksaaya gaya or unhone hatya kar di
 The accused are Vijay Gambhir, Ranjit Yadav and Ajay Lalge
 inhen pehle seshan court se zamaanat nahin mili thi tab ye hai court gaye or zamaanat mil gai
 Questions are arising regarding this order
 aadesh kaa sandarbh or aadesh kii bhashaa donon ko hi dekhnaa hoga
 It has to be kept in mind that this is not a court decision but an order of bail
 aadesh main jaj sahiba ne zamaanat kii sharten bhi likhi hai ki ye log kisi bhi tareeke se hindu raashtra sena jaise dharmik sanghathan se khud ko nahin jodenge
 The accused will not go to the area where the incident took place
 kya is aadesh main yah kaha ja rahaa he ki mohsin shaikh kii hatya bhadakaane ke kaaran hui, isliye zamaanat ke liye itnaa kaaran kaaphi he ki ve bhadakaae gaye the
 It is written in the order that the mistake of the deceased was that he belonged to another religion
 ham is aadesh ke sandarbh main baat karnaa chaahate hai
 According to the orders of the Supreme Court, you cannot question the intent of the court
 faisle kii samiksha kar sakate hai
 It is a fact that cyber attacks were carried out against Zaira for political reasons
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki in hamalon main islam kaa naam lekar use nishaanaa banaaya gaya, jise lekar wo dar gai yaa peeche hat gai
 But there is one more fact
 usee kashmir ke noujvaan mahabuuba mufti se milane ke pehle tak zaayra kii kamyaabi kaa jashn bhi manaa rahe the
 It is also a fact that the youth of the same Kashmir came forward and defended Zaira even after the cyber attack
 tab bhi kiya or ab bhi kar rahe hai
 Mohammad Faisal and Khizir Humsafrani have written on Vithkashmir
com that a part of the same Kashmir is raising voice against those who hate Zaira but that is not breaking news
 kashmiriyon main 'dangal' ko lekar itnaa utsaah tha ki kashmiri pir punjaal se jammu aae film dekhne
 As usual, the leaders also took photographs to capture one's success
 pichley saal kii ghatnaon ke kaaran mukhyadhara ke netaaon kii saakh ghati he
 Therefore, the leaders were trying to send a message among the youth that they take care of them

 Despite losing the toss and coming out to bat, last year's runners-up Bangalore, despite not being able to take advantage of the aggressive start at home, made a competitive score of 157 for seven from de Villiers' unbeaten 64 runs
 shuruuaati match main kolkata niterides ko aath wicket se haraakar aatmavishvaas se bhari dilli dairedevills aaj na to ballebaaji or na hi gendbaaji main acha pradarshan kar saki tathaa chinnaswami stadium main lagaataar antaraal par wicket ganvaane se nirdhaarit 20 over main saat wicket par 137 ran hi bana paayi
 For Royal Challengers Bangalore, Muralitharan took three for 25 in four overs while Zaheer Khan, Daniel Vettori and Andrew mcdonald took one wicket each
 dilli dairedevills ne apana pehla wicket salaami ballebaaj or captain virendra sahvaag ke rup main khoyaa jo khaataa bhi nahin khol sake
 He was already caught by Cheteshwar Pujara off Zaheer off the fifth ball of the over
 isse pehle duusare salaami ballebaaj eron finch (24 gend main 25 ran) ne shuru kii teen gendon main teen chauke lagaakar team ko acchhee shuruuaat dilaayi thi
 Finch and Ojha (33 off 26 balls with three fours and a six) added 42 runs for the second wicket which was also the team's best partnership but after that no batsman could stay at the crease for long
 venugopal raav (18), glen maxwail (3), yogesh nagar (16) bhi lambii paariyaan nahin khel paye
 In the end, Delhi was definitely expected from Irfan Pathan as he played an important role in winning the team by playing an unbeaten 42-run aggressive innings in the first match but today he failed to live up to the expectations and two fours and one in 15 balls
 He was run out after scoring 24 runs with sixes
 isse pehle royal chalangers kii ore se divilliars ne 42 gend kii visphotak naabad pari main chah chauke or do chakke jadkar team ko sammanjanak score banane main madad kii
 Explosive batsman Chris Gayle could not play in the match due to a fitness problem, which led Bangalore to face an aggressive performance from new cricket star Virat Kohli, but the Delhi batsman flopped and de Villiers (64 not out) and r Vinay Kumar (18) Except for a 54-run partnership between Bangalore, no strong partnership could be formed in the Bangalore team
 salaami ballebaaj andrew mcdonald (30) ne team ke liye mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Macdonald gave the Royal Challengers a good start but as soon as he was out, there was a parade of players returning to the pavilion
 glen maxwail dilli ke sabase safal gendbaaj rahe, unhone apane chaar over main 32 ran dekar teen wicket chatkaye
 Morne Morkel also picked up two wickets for Delhi
 divilliars ne royal chalangers bangalore kii pari ko tab sambhala jab mejabaan team ne 85 ran ke andar paanch wicket kho diye the
 Had this not been an aggressive batsman from South Africa, the Bangalore team would have been in trouble as the charismatic captain Daniel Vettori was run out by adding three runs to the score
 dilli ke star gendbaaj irfan aaj puri tarah se flop rahe, unhone chaar over main 47 ran ganvaaye jisamen se do over ke pehle spel main 23 ran bane
 He was heavily washed out by both mcdonald and de Villiers
 umesh yadav dilli ke sabase kifayati gendbaaj rahe, lekin unhen koi wicket nahin mila
 He conceded only eight runs in two overs
 vahiin number paanch par bhi kohli kaa record acha he
 In 21 innings of 16 Tests at this position, Virat has scored 771 runs with the help of 3 centuries
 teen test kii series main team india 0-1 se pichad gai he
 In such a situation, if Team India does not solve the screw of the number three in time, then the team's dream of winning the series in Sri Lanka for 22 years will never be fulfilled

 kohli ne guuruuvaar ko westeindies ke khilaaf 86 ranon kii pari ke saath ek nayaa record bhi bana daalaa
 With this half-century innings in the first match of the 3 ODI series, Kohli equaled the record of the great Caribbean batsman Viv Richards
 vanade cricket main sabase kam pariyon main 5000 ranon tak pahunchane kaa record abhi tak richards ke naam par darj tha lekin ab kohli ne bhi ye karnama kar dikhaaya he
 a record made in 114 innings of 120 odis, Kohli, who is famous for his sharp attitude, has played 120 ODI matches during which he batted in 114 innings
 richards ne bhi 30 janvari 1987 ko england ke khilaaf melbern main apni 114veen pari main 5000 ran puure kiye the
 In this way, the record of reaching this point in the lowest innings has been jointly recorded in the name of Kohli and Richards

 Virat is very happy to share the record with 'virat' khushirichards who got Kohli to match Richards' record but he never bats thinking of making a record
 viraat ne kaha, âmujhe pichley vanade match main bengalooru main (record banane ke bare main) kaha gaya tha, lekin mujhe vaaki yah yaad nahin tha kyonki main record ke bare main sochakar nahin kheltaa
 i have to say to myself that if you bat well then these milestones will keep coming in the way

 newjiland cricket team ke khilaaf mangalvaar ko chauthe ekadivasiy mukaable main match jitau pari (naabad 93 ran) khilne vaale pakistan ke ballebaaj misbah ul haq apane is shandaar form ko aage bhi barkaraar rakhana chaahate hai
 Misbah made an unbeaten 93-run innings victory to Pakistan by two wickets
 iske saath hi pakistan chah maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 2-1 se aage ho gaya he
 The website 'sportal dot ko dot in' quoted Misbah as saying, "I want to retain this form even further
 mujhe lagata he ki meri is safalataa main team prabandhan, chayankarta, coach or captain kaa bada haath he
 He exuded confidence in me, due to which i was able to play a brilliant innings
 " misbah is dauraan apane kariyar ke pehle shatak se chook gaye
 He said that he played according to the need of the team
 misbah ne kaha, "main newjiland daure kaa bharpoor lutf uthaa rahaa hum
 i have also performed well so far
 mere liye team kii jeet sabase mahatvapurn he
 " kehete hai jab police apni par aati he to achche-acchon ke hosh thikaane aa jate hai
 And now in the police interrogation, Asaram's daughter Bharti finally accepted the same thing that the police wanted to hear from her
 bharti ne maan liya ki wo apane pita asaram kii kutiyaa main ladakiyon ko bheja karti thi, lekin akhir sabakuch jaanate hue bhi bharti kyon karti thi aisa?'haa, main ye maanati hum ki main inhen (balaatkaar peedit ladki) jaanati hum
 And i sent them for the first time in the hut of Asaramji Bapu's solitude
 ' ye wo kubulanamaa he, jo balaatkaar or yon shoshan ke aaropon se ghire swayambhu sant asaram kii takadir ke taabut main aakhri keel sabit ho saktaa he
 Because this Kuboolnama is not of anyone else but of Bharti Sirumalani aka Bharti Shri, daughter of Asaram himself
 police kii maane to poochtacha ke dauraan unhone peedit ladki kaa bharti or asaram se aamanaa-saamana karavaaya
 Here Bharti not only recognized the girl, but also said that it was she who sent her to the hut near Asaram
 police kaa kahana he ki cross interogeshan ke dauraan jab ladki ne khud hi bharti se sawaal-jawaab shuru kiye, to bharti ke paas use pahchaanane or sari baat kubulane ke sivaay koi chaara hi nahin tha, kyonki ye ladki unke ahmedabad ashram main hi rahati thi
 However, when asked Bharti that despite knowing everything, why did she send the girl to Asaram's hut alone? So Bharti replied, 'I had sent the girl to Asaram Ji Bapu for mantra initiation
 kutiyaa ke andar kya hua, iske bare main mujhe koi jaankaree nahin he
 It is not Bharti's confession alone about Asaram's stigma, Dhruvben, Asaram's sage, has also confessed to the police interrogation, which the rape victim has said
 masalan, dhruvaben ne un chaar ladakiyon ko jaanane kii baat maan lee he, balaatkaar kii shikaar ladki ne dhruvaben par jin ladakiyon kaa garbhpaat karwaane kaa ilzaam lagaaya he
 Although Dhruvben has said that many of the girls had been taken to the doctor for treatment if Ayurvedic medicines did not work many times, but they did not get the girls aborted
 ahmedabad police kaa kahana he ki shuruaati poochtacha main donon kaa ye kubulanamaa is baat kii tasdik karata he ki peedit ladki kii bataai gai baaten bilkul sahi hai
 Now he needs some more circumstantial evidence to investigate this matter
 jab rasoiye ne munh kholaa to ataki asaram kii saancemblaatkaar kii shikaar ladki ko asaram kii kutiyaa tak le jane vaale rasoiye ne jab apana munh kholaa to sunne vaale bas sunate rah gaye
 Asaram's breath got stuck, because his truth was not only going to make the color creepy, but he was the biggest secret of Kutia's stigma
 ab asaram ke sabase kareebi do raajadaaron ne unke bare main jo khulaasa kiya he, use sun kar maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi police afasaron kaa dimag bhi chakra gaya he
 Because one of these rajdars has agreed to take the victim girl to Asaram's stigma, while the other has been a friend of that girl in the ashram
 inhone bataaya he ki ahmedabad ke ashram main asaram ne sirf ek nahin balki ladakiyon ke saath saalon-saal samarpan or saannnidhya ke naam par balaatkaar kiya
 Calling girls in their stigma, they continued to sexually abuse them
 akhilesh asaram kaa rasoiyaa tha
 The man who once burned the stove for Asaram, has now decided to burn Asaram's lie in the heat of truth
 mujffanagar ke rahane vaale akhilesh ne police kii poochtacha main asaram kii tamaam karatuuton kaa bhanda to phoda hi he, siarpisi kii dhara 164 ke tahat magistrate ke saamne bayaan dekar apni baton par kaanoon kii muhar bhi lagava lee he
 Akhilesh has revealed that the girl who has accused Asaram of rape in Ahmedabad, the girl was not taken by anyone else, but he himself had taken it to Asaram's hut
 or asaram ne ghanton uske saath nazaij harakat kii
 According to the police, Akhilesh had sent not only this girl, but also many more girls to Asaram in the name of dedication and belonging
 wo 1994 se lekar 2003 tak asaram ke ashram main kaam karata rahaa or is dauraan wo ashram main honevaale asaram ke har dhatakaram banataa rahaa
 The cook's wife also knew a lot
 Akhilesh's wife Varsha was the speaker of the ashram
 akhilesh kii patni varsha ne to asaram ke bare main jo khulaasa kiya he, wo kahin or bhi zyaada chaunkaane vaala he
 Because Varsha has not only been witness to Asaram's misdeeds, but has also been a friend of the girl who accused Asaram of rape
 police sutron kii maane to varsha ne police ko bataaya ki kis tarah is ladki ko bahala-phuslaa kar asaram ke gurgon ne use ekantavaas kii kutiyaa tak pahunchaaya tha
 And after spending many hours when she came out of the hut, she got feverish due to nervousness and discomfort

 AAP candidate Amanatullah, who contested on the Lok Janshakti Party ticket in 2013, seems to have made a dent in this region, which is considered to be the stronghold of Asif

 film kaa naam:welcome baikadiarector:anis bajmistar cast:jon abraham, anil kapur, naanaa patekar, paresh rawal, nasiruddin shah, dimple kapaadiya, shruti hasan ,shaini aahujyavadhi:153 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2
 5 starsal is set to release the next installment of the same film after 8 years of the 2007 release 'welcome'
 anis bajmi ne us vakt ke kuch kirdaaron ko ek baar phir se is film main liya he or bahut se nae actors bhi is frenchiji se jude hai
 Even today, when Welcome comes on TV, the interest of watching remains intact, now will the next part of that film also be appreciated by the audience? Let's review
 kahaneeyah kahani he udai (naanaa patekar), uske bhai majanu (anil kapur), bahan sanjana(shruti hasan) or hone vaale damaad ajju bhai urf ajay barsi (jon abraham) kii
 The film also stars Wanted Bhai (naseeruddin Shah) and his son (shiney Ahuja) ruling over Uday and Majnu
 ab ek taraf ajju bhai or sanjana kii lav story he to vahiin duusari taraf udai, or majanu, maharani (dimple kapaadiya) kii beti chandani (ankitha shrivastav) ke prati apana prem darshane lagate hai
 In the midst of all this, Dr
 Ghungroo (paresh Rawal) is also adamant on all kinds of insistence
 phir anis bajmi kii style menfilm ko anjaam diya jaataa he
 The script is full of comedy based on script conditions of acting and music
 interval ke pehla hissaa behtareen dikhataa he, pet pakadakar hasane tak kii naubat aa jaati he lekin interval ke baad lagata he kii kahani kahin or hi kho gai he
 Anees Bazmee wanders somewhere in the second half, quite a hilarious double story
 vaise film ke van liners or comic timming kaaphi behtareen thi
 There is a sequence of Antakshari in the film, which makes him laugh and make him laugh
 film kaa second halfakaphi niraashaajankahai
 And along with Shruti Haasan, the reason for John Abraham being in the film also looked quite meaningless
 abhinay ke maamle main anil kapur, naanaa patekar ,raajapaal yadav or paresh rawal ne utkrisht abhinay kaa pradarshan kiya he, vahiin jon abraham kii acting saraahneey he
 Somewhere in Naseeruddin Shah's acting, it seemed that he was not given the opportunity to say openly, quite loosely
 vahiin shaini ahuja kaa welcome back hua he, lekin ankitha shrivastav kii jagah or acchhee casting kii ja sakati thi
 Somewhere Akashya Kumar's lack was definitely disturbed in the film
 film ke geeton kaa jamaavada pehali vaali 'welcome' kii hi tarah rakhaa gaya he, ek taraf jon or shruti ke bich lav sang, to vahiin puure parivaar kaa 'tuuti bole wedding di' geet bhi darshaya jaataa he
 By the way, there are one or two songs that were not needed, and because of them the duration of the film increases considerably
 kyon dekhegar aap jon, anil, paresh, nasiruddin shah jaisi badi star cast or paristhitiyon par aadhaarit kamedi ke diwane hai, to yah film jarur dekhen
 Why not watch movies like Entry, Welcome and entertain you as soon as it comes on TV, it is better you can wait till the Welcome Back is also on TV

 It is decorated with colors of gold water and precious stones, and iron (top part of the page) is decorated with maps
 ab dekhie, sanskrit se farsi main anuwaad ek hindu karata he or farsi se hindi main anuwaad do muslim karte hai
 Waqarul Hasan could not even see his translation as a book
 unka dehanth ho gaya
 There is not such a large number of color photographs in the Ramayana written in any language of the world
 "bismillah-arrahaman-arrahim - sari prashansa us ishwar ke liye hi he, jo meraa pathpradarshak he or kripapaatr hona bhi usee ko shobhaneey he
 
 
 i am writing this Ramayana after the benevolence of that Wahudud Lashriq (unique, God)
 
 
 yadhyapi prithvi par teen ramayana pai jaati hai, parantu shriram kii manonukool ramayana yahi he
 
 
 " ramayana kii shuruyaat in panktiyon se hoti he
 You can buy this Ramayana for four thousand rupees
 kaaphi baari he vaise
 There can be a separate book on its pictures only
 ram-lakshmana or sita mogul style ke rajasi paridhaanon main nazar aate hai
 Especially the turban or cap are absolutely Mughal era
 kuch tasveeron main haath main dhanush kii jagah talwaar he
 Sri Ram is seen in the dhoti and janeu among the sages
 vishwamitra, shriram or raja dasharath kaa ek chitra he, jisamen bartanon main heere jade hai
 This Ramayana is highly collectable
 rampur ke paas ek aisa ramayana he, jisaki katha abhi thik se nahin kahi gai he
 
 
 Should be said tippaniyan Our governments only show religious places and palaces in tourism advertisements
 librari or musium kaa zikr tak nahin aata
 Visiting the museum is considered to be the most important tourist in outside countries 
 librari ke sahyogi kaaphi madadgaar hai
 Raza Library is open on all days except on Fridays
 mujhe ummid he ki paryaton par jor dene vaale hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi is par bhi vichaar karenge
 At least Akhilesh Yadav can promote this heritage of Uttar Pradesh
 kisne roka he ki vah centre kii librari kaa prachaar nahin kar sakate
 History is only about his kingdom
 rampur kii churi or aazam khan ke tanj bayanon ko sab jaanate hai, raza librari kaa ramayana kaha jayega to samaaj ko kahin zyada laabh hoga
 Climbing the stairs of the Raza Library, i thought of Kolkata
 librari ke sahyogi kaaphi rochak tareeke se bataa rahe the ki dekhie sidhiyon, darvaaze or deevaaron par verma kii tik lakadiyaan lagi hai
 In 1774, Nawab Faizullah Khan of Rampur laid its foundation
 nawabon kii apni ek librari hua karti thi, jise qutubanamaa kaha jaataa he
 Once, while doing research for 'ravish's report', he started calling in the areas of Western UP, then it came to know that many libraries have been finished
 baahar ke mulkon ke karidaar oune-paune daamon par kitaaben le ja chuke hai
 That report could not be made, but Raza remained hooked to see the library
 italian marble se bani in murtiyon kii umr sau saal se zyaada ho chuki he
 i wish Rampur's political heritage would have been magnificent and gentle like this corridor
 rampur ke hi hai aazam khan or muqataar abbaas naqvi, lekin unki siyaasi jubaan par is librari kaa zaraa bhi asar nahin dikhataa he
 After coming here, it felt that the city had also left this library
 vahaan javaaniyaan nahin dikhin
 Some people met, who came to see their heritage for the library
 kuch thake hue noujvaan akhbaar padhate mili
 It was told that there are a lot of scholars from Israel, America and less from India
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ko raza librari kii kubi maaloom hai
 He has asked for samples of heritage books from here for his two trips abroad
 raza librari bharat sarkaar ke tahat ek swytt sanstha he
 In different times, buildings were built from rooms to libraries
 is tasviir main aap hamid haul dekh rahe hai
 Its grandeur starts asking you the question, tell me where were you till now
 nawab mohammad said khan ne librari ke liye alag department hi banwaaya tha
 During the revolution of 1857, the British caused considerable damage to the library, yet the library stood up
 is hamid haul main musium he, lekin jab yah haul bana tha, tab yahaan nawab hamid ali kii court laga karti thi
 In this hall, balconies remain for women to see from above
 1905 main raza librari is imaarat main aa gai or tab se yaheen he
 In this hall, Chandilier is a celebrity in Asia and the Philips bulb in it has not been fused for a hundred years
 rampur kii raajnneeti badal rahi he
 Azam Khan has improved a lot
 rampur ko chamakaa rahe hai
 In suppressed and unconcerned tongue, it was heard that Azam Khan has enmity from the era of Nawabs
 vah librari ke complex ke baahar bane buland darwaazon ko dhaha sakate hai
 If the gates like Ajmeri Gate and Kashmiri Gate are not there, then the grandeur of this building of the library will become poor
 is kollam ko gaur se dekhie
 At the bottom is the mosque, then the church, the gurdwara jharokha above it and the temple at the top

 Obviously, the Nawabs would have agreed
 yah imaarat hindustan ke secular hone ke tasawwur kii ek acchhee misaal ho sakati he
 How many fights can be stopped? in sab chote-chote kisson se secular hindustan banane kii prakriya aaj bhi jari he
 These small stories are about to be relieved in the midst of countless bloodshed of religious disputes

 Nawab Mohammad Saeed Khan had set up a separate department for the library
 1857 kii kranti ke samay angrezon ne librari ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya, phir bhi librari khadi ho gai
 There is a museum in this Hamid Hall, but when this hall was built, Nawab used to put Hamid Ali's court here

 The Raza Library moved into this building in 1905 and has been here ever since

 The politics of Rampur is changing

 He can demolish the elevated doors outside the library's complex

 The Valmiki Ramayana of the seventeenth century is worth seeing

 akbar ke samay ramayana kaa farsi main anuwaad karaayaa gaya tha
 a Ramayana is in Jaipur
 raza librari main bhi farsi main ek ramayana he
 Pro
 shah abdussalaam or doctor vakaarul hasal siddiki ne farsi se hindi main anuwaad kiya he
 Watching this Ramayana was like taking yourself back three centuries
 mogul style main 258 prasangon ke chitra banaae gaye hai
 In those pictures Ram, Sita and Ravana look completely different from the present day
 is tasviir main ramayana ke das siron ke upar ek gadhaa bhi he
 The Ramayana near the Raza Library was translated in Sanskrit to Persian by Sumer Chand in 1713
 sumer chand ne mughal shaasha farrukhsier ke shasankaal main likhaa tha
 It is decorated with colors of gold water and precious stones, and iron (top part of the page) is decorated with maps
 ab dekhie, sanskrit se farsi main anuwaad ek hindu karata he or farsi se hindi main anuwaad do muslim karte hai
 Waqarul Hasan could not even see his translation as a book
 unka dehanth ho gaya
 There is not such a large number of color photographs in the Ramayana written in any language of the world
 "bismillah-arrahaman-arrahim - sari prashansa us ishwar ke liye hi he, jo meraa pathpradarshak he or kripapaatr hona bhi usee ko shobhaneey he
 
 
 i am writing this Ramayana after the benevolence of that Wahudud Lashriq (unique, God)
 
 
 yadhyapi prithvi par teen ramayana pai jaati hai, parantu shriram kii manonukool ramayana yahi he
 
 
 " ramayana kii shuruyaat in panktiyon se hoti he
 You can buy this Ramayana for four thousand rupees
 kaaphi baari he vaise
 There can be a separate book on its pictures only
 ram-lakshmana or sita mogul style ke rajasi paridhaanon main nazar aate hai
 Especially the turban or cap are absolutely Mughal era
 kuch tasveeron main haath main dhanush kii jagah talwaar he
 Sri Ram is seen in the dhoti and janeu among the sages
 vishwamitra, shriram or raja dasharath kaa ek chitra he, jisamen bartanon main heere jade hai
 This Ramayana is highly collectable
 rampur ke paas ek aisa ramayana he, jisaki katha abhi thik se nahin kahi gai he
 
 
 Should be said tippaniyan Our governments only show religious places and palaces in tourism advertisements
 librari or musium kaa zikr tak nahin aata
 Visiting the museum is considered to be the most important tourist in outside countries
 librari ke sahyogi kaaphi madadgaar hai
 Raza Library is open on all days except on Fridays
 mujhe ummid he ki paryaton par jor dene vaale hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi is par bhi vichaar karenge
 At least Akhilesh Yadav can promote this heritage of Uttar Pradesh
 kisne roka he ki vah centre kii librari kaa prachaar nahin kar sakate
 History is only about his kingdom
 rampur kii churi or aazam khan ke tanj bayanon ko sab jaanate hai, raza librari kaa ramayana kaha jayega to samaaj ko kahin zyada laabh hoga

 raza librari ke paas jo ramayana he, uskaa anuwaad 1713 main sumer chand ne sanskrit se farsi main kiya tha
 Sumer Chand wrote during the reign of Mughal Sha Sak Farrukhsiyar
 ise sone ke pani tathaa keemtee pattharon ke rango se gulbuute or naksho-nigaar se louh (panne kaa upree bhaag) sajaai gai he
 Now see, one Hindu translates from Sanskrit to Persian and two Muslims translate from Persian to Hindi
 vaqaarul hasan apane anuwaad ko pustak ke rup main dekh bhi nahin sake
 He died sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa main likhit ramayana main itani badi sankhya main rangeen tasviren nahin hai
 "bismillah-arrahman-arrahim - All praise is for the God who is my guide and it is also beautiful to be gracious
 
 
 us vahdood lacriq (adwitiya, ishwar) ke upkaar ke baad main yah ramayana likh rahaa hum
 
 
 Although three Ramayanas are found on earth, this is the Ramayana which is the desire of Shri Ram
 
 
 " The Ramayana begins with these lines
 chaar hazaar rupee main aap is ramayana ko kareed sakate hai
 Is quite heavy by the way
 isaki tasveeron par hi alag se kitaab ho sakati he
 rama-lakshmana and Sita are seen in Mughal style of royal costumes
 khaskar pagadi yaa topi bilkul hi mughaliya daur kii hai
 Some pictures have a sword in hand instead of a bow
 rishi-muniyon ke bich ke shriram dhoti or janeu main nazar aate hai
 There is a picture of Vishwamitra, Shriram and King Dasaratha, with diamonds in the pot
 yah ramayana behad sangrahntiya he

 asia cap main sabase bada apaset bangladesh ne kiya jab ek tarah se semifinal match main pakistan ko shikast de di
 In Asia, it seems that two teams are emerging, Bangladesh and Afghanistan
 do timen neeche phisalati ja rahi hai jaise srilanka or pakistan
 Sri Lanka was seen as a directionless team in a very bad condition, which needed a leader and inspiration
 uske ulat bangladesh or afghanistan aise khel rahe hai jaise kal khelen yaa na khelen
 That is, they are throwing everything in that match today and they are getting reward for that too
 bangladesh kii safalataa ke peeche unka premier lig he jahaan khilaadiyon ko match khilne kaa phayda antarrashtriya str ke maichon main miltaa he
 On the other hand, Sri Lanka has tried many times to make their Premier League debut but has not been successful
 srilanka or bangladesh ke bich abhi sabase bada antar he un khilaadiyon kaa jo baakiyon ko acha khilne ke liye prerit karen
 After the departure of Sangakkara, Jayawardene, Dilshan, Muralidharan and Chamunda Vas in Sri Lanka cricket, there is no player in the team who can inspire the rest
 jabaki bangladesh kii team main shaakib, musafijur rahim or captain mashrafe murttaja aise khilaadi hai jo apane khel se team ko upar le jate hai
 The funniest thing is that Bangladesh appointed Sri Lanka's Chandika Hathurusingha as coach under whose tenure the team performed well
 2015 main jab pakistan ne bangladesh kaa daura kiya to bangladesh ne teenon vanade jeeta or tii-20 bhi
 His ranking came in seventh place after playing well in the 2015 World Cup
 jiske kaaran bangladesh isisi champion trophy ke liye qualifi kar gaya
 Bangladesh then defeated Zimbabwe and became runners-up of the 2016 Asia Cup
 tippaniyan Behind the bowling of Bangladesh is also the hand of Kottney Walls, who was also the interim coach in the middle with the bowling coach
 
 In Sri Lanka, in the last 3 years, the selection committee has changed 5 captains, 5 head coaches, 4 batting coaches, 4 times
 yahi nahin pichley 3 saalon main 3 baar srilanka cricket board bhi badal chukaa he
 All these things have broken the back of the one time world winning team
 vahiin asia cap ke final main pahunchakar bangladesh ke hausale or buland honge
 But the biggest thing behind the victory of Bangladesh is their passion for victory and the dedication to the game
 yahi vajah he ki vah gaahe bagaahe bharat ko bhi shikast de detaa he
 Therefore, it is good to play them carefully
 yahi nahin agle saal vishwa cap ke liye bhi bangladesh ek khatarnaak team rahegi jo kisi bhi badi team kii lutiyaa dubo sakati he

 sabase mjedaar baat he ki bangladesh ne srilanka ke chandika hathurusingha ko coach banaaya jinke kaarykaal main team kaa pradarshan acha rahaa
 When Pakistan toured Bangladesh in 2015, Bangladesh won all three odis and also T20
 2015 ke world cap main acha khilne ke baad unki rankig saatven sthaan par aa gai
 Due to which Bangladesh qualified for ICC Champion Trophy
 phir bangladesh ne zimbabwe ko haraaya or 2016 ke asia cap ke upavijeta bane
 The comments bangladesh kii bowling ke peeche cotni vals kaa bhi haath he jo bowling coach ke saath bich main antarim coach bhi rahe
 
 vahiin srilanka main pichley 3 saal main 5 captain, 5 head coach, 4 batting coach , 4 baar chayan samiti badal chuki he
 Not only this, Sri Lanka Cricket Board has also changed 3 times in the last 3 years
 in sab chizon ne ek vakt ke vishwa vijeta team kii qamar hi tod di he
 At the same time, Bangladesh will be encouraged and elevated by reaching the final of the Asia Cup
 lekin bangladesh kii jeet ke peeche sabase badi baat he jeet ke liye unka jajba or khel ke liye sarmapan
 This is the reason why he defeats India too
 isliye inase sanbhalkar khilne main hi bhalaai he
 Not only this, Bangladesh will also be a dangerous team for the World Cup next year, which can sink the loot of any big team

 a Patwari, who was removed from government farms in Manesar area of gurugram, was shot and killed
 firing main patawaari kaa driver bhi ghayal ho gaya
 He is admitted to the hospital for treatment
 police maamle kii jaanch main jute gai he
 The incident is from Manesar Sector-1
 jahaan sarkari jameen par graminon ne avaidh rup se fasal laga lee thi
 Patwari Ishwar Singh of HSIIDC went there with his team to take away that crop
 dopaher kareeb 2 baje achaanak kuch log vahaan pahunche or ishwar singh parfiringeshuru kar di
 In this attack, Ishwar Singh received two bullets while his driver Virendra also got a bullet in his hand
 ishwar singh ko aspataal le jaaya gaya
 But he died before reaching the hospital
 unke driver kaa rockland aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 The deceased 52-year-old Ishwar Singh was posted as Patwari at Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation
 manesar main darjanon acre aisi sarkari jameen he, jis par graminon ne avaidh kabja karke bajre kii kheti kerani shuru kar di thi
 Ishwar Singh went there with his team to take possession of this land
 hatya kisne kii yah to abhi tak pataa nahin chal paaya, lekin police ne agyaat logon ke khilaaf cese darj kar liya he
 The great thing is that when Patwari Ishwar Singh went to take possession of the land and there was no police with him
 muslim paksh ke vakil dhawan ne kaha, 1528 main banaai gai masjidmasjid main 1528 se 22 disambar 1949 tak lagaataar namaaj padhi gaisupreme court main ayodhya cese maamle main 29wein din sunwaayee chal rahi he
 In court, the lawyer for the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan, said that the mosque was built in 1528, about five hundred years ago and continued to offer prayers till 22 December 1949
 tab tak vahaan andar koi murti nahin thi
 Once the mosque is there, there will always be a mosque
 vakil rajeev dhawan ne hycourt ke justise khan or masjid agarwal ke faislon ke ansh ke hawaale se muslim paksh ke kabje kii baat kahi
 He said that he had authority over the outer enclosure
 lagaataar or khaastaur par kabje kaa koi pruf nahin he, jabaki justise sharma ne hindu pakshakaron ke adhikaar or puja kii baat sweekaari he
 However, both parties do not even have revenue records dating back to 1885
 aurangzeb ne mandiron ke liye daan kiyaarajeev dhawan ne apni daleel main yah bhi kaha ki aurangzeb ne kai mandiron ke liye anudaan bhi die the
 There is also a belief about the Nathdwara temple
 iske maukhik or likhit pramaan bhi hai
 If a large number of people worship at a temple, then there is no basis for it to be a juristic person
 rajeev dhawan ne hai court ke faisle kii khami yah he ki ek hi jagah ke do juristic person nahin ho sakate
 Just as Gurudwara and Gurugranth Sahib cannot be two juristic persons
 sirf gurugranth sahib jab gurudwara main hote hai tabhi wo gurudwara banataa he
 The court did not consider Murthy as a juristic person
he further said that Thakur Gokulnathji Vallabhacharya had given 7 idols to his seven grandsons
 jo gokul main he
 It was disputed
 tab bhi court ne murti ko juristic person nahin mana tha
 On this plea of dhawan, Justice Bobde asked, that even without an idol, there could be a god like the element of sky, Chidambaram Nataraja
 is par dhawan ne kaha ki lekin aisi jagah par kuch na kuch nirmaan, dhaancha yaa aakaar jarur hona chahie jisase ye vishwaas ho ki ye juristic person he
 Chidambaram may be an exception to this
 justise bobade ne kaha ki chidambaram to vishisht maamla tha
 On this, Rajiv Dhawan said that according to Google, this temple was built in the 10th century during the Chola reign
 pies narsimha ne bataaya ki chidambaram main shiv ke paanch mandir banaae gaye
 Symbols of the five elements i
e
 earth, water, sky, fire and air
 chidambaram akaash ke pratik hai

 # gethalesinâ Kevin Pietersen (@kp24)november 29, 2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given such indications that the budget will not be populist
 aise main is bajet main bhi kuch kade faisle dikhaai pad sakate hai
 Soni's mother, deceased in Delhi's Bawana accident, does not agree with authorities that 17 people were killed in Saturday's fire, saying 18 people were killed in the accident, including their daughter's unborn child
 
 ek saath padhie somvaar subah kii badi khabaren
 1- This budget will not be populist Modi said - people do not want the free thing, know my work
 Preparations for the general budget have started in the country
 2019 chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar kaa ye aakhri purna bajet hoga
 In such a situation, it was expected that this budget would be slightly populist, which would attract people before the elections
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is prakaar ke sanket die hai ki bajet loklubhaavan nahin hoga
 In such a situation, some tough decisions can also be seen in this budget

 dhanyavadabandana kumarividhayak shalimaar baag Sushil Kumar Modi, who was the deputy chief minister of Bihar along with Nitish Kumar from November 2005 to June 2013, alleged that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was deliberately plotting to create an electoral issue by creating a shortage of pulses in Bihar and to discredit the central government
 Huh

 yahi nahin, anya rajyon kii tarah stock simit karne kaa bhi praavdhaan nahin kiya gaya he
 The BJP leader said that in view of the shortage of pulses, about 500 successful pulses have been made available in Delhi and 120 rupees per kg through central warehouse, while in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand, 130 also through PDS shops
 Pulses are being given to consumers at the rate of Rs 125 per kg
 dilli ke khudara bazaaron main haalanki arhar daal 200 rupee prati kilo mil rahi he
 Sushil Modi said that the Gujarat government has made arrangements to provide pulses at the rate of Rs 130 per kg in consultation with business organizations
 unhone kaha, 'bihar sarkaar apni naakaamiyon kii aad main daal kii killat paidaa kar centre sarkaar ko badnaam karnaa chaahati he
 Nitish Kumar's intention is to make pulses scarcity and rising prices an election issue, distracting the attention of people from their failures and promises

 yani har roj 17 kisaanon ne khudakushi kii he

 He said that due to the hostile conduct of the local people in the Kashmir Valley, people are more casualties and the security forces will treat those who are attacked as 'anti-nationals' during anti-terrorist operations and 'strict action' will be taken against them
 sena pramukh ke is bayaan kii jahaan kuch raajnneetik dalon ne aalochana kii he, vahiin raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne unka samarthan kiya he
 Parrikar said that the army does not consider every Kashmiri a terrorist, but if someone does something against the army, the officer present is free hand

 sabhi parents yah chaahate hai ki unke bacchon kii acchhee parvarish ho
 Good upbringing of children is not only fulfilling their food, drinking, wearing and everyday needs, but it is the responsibility of parents to develop good habits, discipline and rules to follow in children
 bacchajab bada hone lagata he tabhi se use niyam main rahane kii aadat daalani chahie
 It should not be thought for the children that the younger one will learn later
 kuchparentsbacchon ko choti-choti baton par daantne lagate hai, kuch mata-pita unhen maarthe bhi hai lekin yah tarika galat he
 This type of behavior affects the child
 jab bhibacchakoi galati kare to use uski galati kaa ehsaas karwaanaa chahie or use dobaaraa aisa na karne kii taakid kerani chahie
 Some parents believe that loving children means meeting their every demand
 joparentsbacchon kii har maang ko puraa karte hai unke bachche ziddee ho jate hai
 On insistence, give the children what is necessary
 jababacheisi jid karte hai jinhen puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa to unhen pyaar se samajhaana chahie
 Many times it happens that parents do not listen to their children and scold them and silence them
 aisa karne sebacchonpar galat asar padataa he
 Children should pay attention to their words and listen to them instead of shouting
 bachche ko jo padhai karne or jo banane main ruchi ho use vahi banane den
 When parents force their children to do their will, they have a bad effect on the child
 aaj ke vakt main bachche apni man marji ke mutabik kaam karnaa pasand karte hai
 Parents should be like friends with their children
 bacchon ke saath mitra jaisaa vyavhaar karne se bachche apneparentsse kuch nahin chhupate

 10 paise and 54 paise loan waiver certificates were distributed to the farmers, which led to a lot of deterioration of the government
 lekin ab siem yogi ne is maamle main dakhal dete hue adhikariyon ko sakht nirdash die hai ki 10 hajaar se zyada karj maaf hone vaale kisaanon ko hi certificate die jaaen
 CM Yogi Adityanath has taken this decision after the photo of the media and the complaint of the farmers
 mukhyamantri kii taraf se sabhi jila adhikariyon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki aage se 10 hajaar se kam ke karj maafee kaa na to certificate jari ho naa hi kisaanon ko is kaarykram main bulaayaa jaae jahaan certificate bant rahe hai
