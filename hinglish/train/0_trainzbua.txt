 In fact, through the petition, the BJP party had challenged the move of the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government to refuse to allow its rally

 Advocate General Kishore Dutta submitted a sealed report to the court and said that the publication of the yatra in the BJP prospectus is of a communally sensitive nature
 unhone daleel di thi ki prashasnic faisle main adaalat ke paas nyaayik samiksha karne kaa simit dayera he
 He said that since 2017, 2100 permission has been granted for various political rallies and gatherings in West Bengal but in this case, the Rath Yatra was not allowed due to the blindness

 Dear Bihar Government (if any) Why are many students of Magadh Vishwa Vidyalaya and University of Bihar writing to me that eligibility in Daroga Recruitment Examination has been kept in such a way that they cannot fill the form
 massej bhejne vaale chaatro kaa kahana he ki 2015-18 kaa parinaam 2019 main aayaa
 That too did not yield complete results
 92,000 chaatro kaa parinaam kuch din pehle aayaa he
 Due to which the doctors will not be able to fill the recruitment examination form, because the rule has been made that only the students who have graduated till 1 January 2019 can fill it
 jinka grajuation kaa satr 2015-18 kaa he, wo kaise is niyam se baahar ho sakate hai? kya jis kamare main aise niyam banate hai, vahaan kisi ko in baton se sahanubhuti nahin hoti ki ye noujvaan jo rajya kii galati ke kaaran teen saal kaa bie chaar saal main kar rahe hai, unhen kyon vanchit kiya ja rahaa he?isliye likhaa he ki bihar sarkaar yadi he
 Please correct this mistake
 deree se riselt aane kii sazaa naujavaanon ko na den
 With what hope are these students writing letters to the news media? Would it not have been disturbing at this time, would have seen news of other students' problems? They should ask themselves what they see in the media and what news do they discuss? Send me a message and even trouble the mps who have voted
 wo kya isliye hai ki chunaav ke samay aapaki bhaawanaaon kaa istamaal karen? aap istamaal hote rahen
 Just a matter of fact, once the mps call the Minister, the matter will be reached
 madhya pradesh main shikshak bhartee pariksha saat aath saal baad hui he
 The result has come after several months
 vahi haal upi ke 69,000 sahaayak shikshakon kaa he
 Due to non-sending of lawyers to the court, the results have not been coming out from seven to eight months and no appointment is being made
 jabaki 4 lakh noujvaan is pariksha ke parinaam kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Think some friends, what has this media and government made of you? How long will a Hindu Muslim work? samay par naukari chahie ki nahin chahie
 Ravish Kumar In another post- Dear Bihar Government (if there is) what should i do with these letters, how much should i write and why they write to me, why do thousands of millions consider whatsapp as Gandhi Maidan? What kind of state is it, we cannot get a BA in three years
 inaki kya galati he ki rajya hi inhen barbaad kar rahaa he
 The battle of regularizing the session for twenty five years could not be won in Bihar

 Thank you, aapkaa prashansak - Amit filmmekar madhur bhandarkar kii 2011 main ai film 'dil to baccha he ji' ko 'e' certificate diya gaya tha kyonki usamen 'virgin' shabd kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha

 Sadly during DTBHJ the V-word got my film an a certificate

 30 saal kii bhartiya shruti basappa bengaluru se iceland hawaii yatra kar rahi thi jab francfort airport par surakshakarmiyon ne jaanch ke dauraan unhen kapade utaarne ke liye kaha
 However, when Shruti's husband, who is from Iceland, came into the room at the insistence of his wife, the security personnel let them go
 is ghatana ke baad shruti ne aakrosh main aakar ek fasebuk post likhaa jisamen unhone 29 march ko hui is vaardaat kaa khulaasa karte hue likhaa 'agar hamaare saath koi europea saathi ho tabhi ham brown shaq ke ghere se baahar hote hai?' Shruti said that her full body scan was done but despite that the security personnel did not stop
 shruti ne jaanchakartaaon se kaha ki vah thapthapaakar unki jaanch kar sakate hai or nivedan kiya ki aisa karte hue vah saavdhaanee baraten kyonki unki haal hi main pet kii surgery hui he
 Medical records were also present with him but the security personnel did not agree
 basappa pichley chah saal se europe main rah rahi hai or unhone is vaardaat ko puri tarah rangabhed kaa maamla bataaya jisaki unhen aadat si pad gai thi
 It was not new for him to pick and check out any one in a long line, but Shruti also said that what happened this time has crossed all limits
 peshey se architect shruti ne fasebuk par likhaa 'mujhase mere kapade utaarne ke liye kaha gaya
 Is this a new rule? Was it not enough that out of a line, you take out any person of your choice that now i can wait to remove my clothes with my hands up? Do i have to wax the legs? Do i have to buy thoughtful underwear for the journey, which will not be to woo my husband, but to hide such shameful and hateful acts at the airport which can no longer be denied? ' airport par shruti basappa ne suraksha jaanch ke liye apane kapade utaarne se inkaar kiya or vah apane pati ko andar bulaae jane kii maang karti rahi
 He said that the tone of the officers' talk changed when they saw Shruti's husband, who is an Icelandic
 shruti likhti hai ki iske turant baad puri kaarywahi maamuli jaanch main badalakar rah gai lekin suraksha karmi ke is ravaiye ne 'mujhe or 'pareshaan' kar diya
 Comments unhone likhaa 'iske baad main khatra nahin rahi
 i was forced to think what would have happened if i had been alone or my husband was not European
 ' Frankfurt Airport officials have not yet responded to ndtv's mail in the matter
 lekin basappa ke fasebuk post par pratikriya dete hue francfort airport ke aadhikarik fasebuk acount se pratikriya main diya gaya jawaab tha ki 'yah sunakar stabdh hai
 This is obviously not a standard protocol
 hamen aapse vistrut jaankaree chahie hogi
 What actually happened? Where and when did this happen? ' shruti ne NDTV se baatcheet main kaha ki unhone is maamle main airport par aadhikarik shikaayat darj kar di thi lekin abhi tak unke paas koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Earlier in January, a 33-year-old Indian-origin Singaporean woman also filed a complaint that the German police at Frankfurt Airport had asked her to press her breasts to find out that she was feeding the baby
 darasal is mahila ke saath breast pump tha lekin vah apane bachche ke saath yatra nahin kar rahi thi
 At this the German police asked the woman to prove that she breastfeed the child
 shruti ne bataaya ki unka puraa body scan kiya gaya lekin uske baavjood surakshakarmi nahin ruke
 Shruti told the investigators that she can examine him by patting him and requested that he should be cautious while doing so as he has recently undergone a stomach surgery
 unke saath medical record bhi maujuud the lekin surakshakarmi nahin maane
 Basappa has been living in Europe for the last six years and he described the incident as a case of complete apartheid which he had become habitual
 lambii si line main kisi bhi ek ko chunakar baahar nikaalnaa or uski jaanch karnaa unke liye nai baat nahin rahi lekin shruti ne saath hi yah bhi kaha ki is baar jo hua usne sari hadein paar kar di
 Architect Shruti by profession wrote on Facebook, 'I was asked to take off my clothes
 kya ye koi nayaa niyam he? kya itnaa kaaphi nahin tha ki ek line main se aap apni marji se kisi bhi vyakti ko baahar nikaal lete hai ki ab main haath upar karke apane kapade utaare jane kaa bhi intjaar karun? kya mujhe pairon ko vaix karnaa hoga? kya mujhe soch samajhakar yatra ke liye antaravastr kharidne honge jo ki mere pati ko rijhaane ke liye nahin, balki airport par hone vaale is tarah ke sharmnaak or ghrinaa se bhare krity ko chupaane ke liye honge jise ab nakaara nahin ja saktaa?' At the airport, Shruti Basappa refused to take off her clothes for a security check and she kept demanding that her husband be called inside
 unhone bataaya ki adhikariyon ke baat karne kaa lehza tab badal gaya jab unhone shruti ke pati ko dekha jo ki ek icelandic hai
 Shruti writes that soon after, the entire proceedings turned into a minor investigation but this attitude of the security personnel 'made me more' upset '
 'tippaniyan He wrote, 'after this, i was not a threat
 main sochane par majaboor ho gai ki agar main akeli hoti yaa mere pati europea nahin hote to kya hota?' francfort airport ke adhikariyon ne abhi tak is maamle main likhe NDTV ke mail kaa jawaab nahin diya he
 But reacting to Basappa's Facebook post, the response from Frankfurt Airport's official Facebook account was' shocked to hear this

 We will need detailed information from you

 haalanki iske saath hi unhone hockey ke jaadugar major dhyanchand ko bhi yah sammaan dene kii baat kahi
 Milkha said, 'I congratulate Vajpayee on being selected for this award
 saath hi malviya ko is sammaan ke liye chune jane par bhi mujhe khushi he
 ' milkha ke anusaar purv hockey diggaj dhyanchand ko bhi is puraskaar ke liye chunaa janaa chahie
 In the presence of Dhyanchand, India managed to win gold medals in the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympic Games
 desh kii ore 1956 or 1960 ke olympic khelon main hissaa lene vaale milkha ne kaha, 'main dhyanchand ko is puraskaar ke liye chaynit hote dekhnaa chahta hum
 To promote sports in the country, it is very important that we also respect our players
 khilaadi na keval desh kaa gaurav badhaate hai balki dusron ko bhi kadi mehnat karne kii prerana dete hai
 ' milkha ke anusaar pichley saal sachin tendulkar ko chunaa janaa acha faisla rahaa

 andhra pradesh main 11veen class main padhane vaali ek ladki kii aawaaj raging kii vajah se chali gai he
 The incident occurred on the night of 19 July in Vizianagaram district where some senior girls at Gayatri Junior College lodged a police report after the ragging incident in which the victim's girl alleged that some senior girls tried to strangle her
 Due to which there were bruises in his throat
 haadase ke baad peedit ladki ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Doctors say that the girl's vocal cords have been badly affected and this has greatly reduced her chances of recovery
 philhal is maamle kii jaanch main police juty he
 The victim girl has been admitted to the hospital after the accident
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki ladki ke vocal cordon par bura asar padaa he or isse uske thik hone kii sambhaavna bahut kam ho gai he
 Police is currently investigating the matter
 kavitaayen or kahaniyon kaa khaas pahalu yah he ki ve hamen ateet, vartmaan or bhavishya kii saiyr bakhubi karaati he
 This walk is where we are confronted with a cloud of hope and darkness of despair
 kavi or kahanikar ke liye sabase mushkil kaam yahi he ki vah kaise apane pathakon ko niraash kiye bina sachai dikhaae or ek ummid kii kiran bhi chhod jaae
 Rashtrakavi Dinkar had no match in this mode
 unki ojasvi kavitaaon se lekar gadhy ke sunahare motiyon main darshan or yatharth ke beshkeemtee heere bhare hue hai
 His poetry will take you to the fertile land of thoughts, then the prose will stop at every line and make you think
 dinakar kaa sahityaaisa samudr he jisamen aap jitna ghota lagaayenge, vah utana gaharaa hota jayega
 i was introduced to him through school books
 tab mere liye yahi jaruri tha ki bas us kavita ko rat jaaun or jahaan kahin bhi jarurat ho ek saans main suna do
 The second thing that struck me in my mind is that his poems should never be read slowly, always recited in a loud voice
 mere jehan main vah ek ojasvi kavi ke rup main sthapit the
 But now things have changed
 sach kahuun to dinakar ab mujhe kavi se zyada darshanik lagane lage hai
 While reading Dinkar's composition 'four Chapters of Culture', there were many occasions when the question of consent and disagreement was felt that only Dinkar could answer my questions
 yah samay aisa he jab raajnneeti or satta ke laalach kii vajah se roj sampradayikta ko nayaa rang diya ja rahaa he
 History is being tampered with, facts are being misrepresented
 koun samaaj kaa hero hoga, yah piaar campan tay kar rahe hai
 The web of lies is being woven
 prajatantr isi jhooth, paakhand or aadambar ke boj tale jhukta ja rahaa he
 At such a time, Dinkar's compositions have become more relevant and they induce a resentment in us, the ability to test the truth and the urge to win
 har andolan main dinakar kii pankti 'singhaasana khaali karo, janata aati he' aaj bhi utani hi praasangik he
 The political-social conditions that existed in Dinkar's time are still present in other forms
 bas jo baat akharati he ki ab raajnneetik dhoortta ko pahchaan kar kalam ke jariye uskaa vyapak virodh karne vaale bahut kam bache hai
 If some are, their literature is not allowed to reach the public or they are killed
 sahitya main bhi jati, dharm or ling ne is kadar kabja kar rakhaa he ki adab kii duniya main daakhil hone se pehle math main daakhil hona hota he
 The monastery needs permission from the monastery
 ve mathadhish jo vichaarsheel prayogon ko kooda kehane ke liye kukhyat hai
 Libraries in the rural or urban areas of the country either do not exist or are in very poor condition
 aise main bihar ke simriya sthit dinakar pustkaalay kaa bina kisi sarkari madad se nirantar chalanaa kisi adarsh se kam nahin he
 This is the ideal for which the Simaria residents remember their ancestors and litterateurs Dinkar very well every year
 jis tarah se simriya main dinakar jayanti manaai jaati he, us tarah kaa ullas hindi pattee ke kisi bhi lekhak ke gaanv main shaayad hi dekhne ko miltaa ho
 But here too, like other places, new problems are arising
 gaanv main sarkari or privet skulon kii sthiti kaa akalan agar padhai or suvidhaon kii drushtikon se karen to halaat bhayaavah hai
 Hundreds of youth migrate from the village every month in search of jobs
 dinakar ne apane gaanv main kanya vidhyalay kii sthapana us samay karwaai thi, jab log ladakiyon kii padhai-likhaai ke bare main sochate bhi nahin the, lekin maujuuda samay main yah kanya vidhyalay badahaal he
 The building in the village may be ready for the 12th standard, but even after the passing of years, due to lack of teachers, it has not been started
 har saal dinakar jayanti par ghoshnaaon ke dher lag jate hai lekin unhen puraa hone main dashakon tak intjaar karnaa padataa he
 The library here should have focused on making e-library, but due to lack of resources, this work has not been done
 kuch din pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main dinakar kii do kitabon kii 50 veen varshganth puraa hone par yojit ek kaarykram main shirkat kii thi
 It was expected that something new in that program would come out for Dinkar's literature or Dinkar's village, but this did not happen
 pataa nahin kya hua ki is bhaashan ke baad dinakar ke sahitya se zyada unki jati par baat hone lagi
 Everyone wanted to fit Dinkar into vote bank politics
 vahi dinakar jinhone jati ke bandhanon par prahaar karte hue likhaa:' jati-jati ratate jinaki puunji keval pakhandamain kya jaanu jati, jati hai ye mere bhujadand'
 To tie that poet to any caste religion is unbecoming of his creations
 dinakar kii rachanaaon ne lagaataar jaat-paat or dharm kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf aapatti darj karai he or aage bhi karaati rahengi
 His literature is not for any ruler or elite class, but for the common people
 pratirodh ke naaro main dinakar kal bhi maujuud the or aage bhi rahenge
 The only fear is that these lines of Bertol Brecht may not prove to be true
 'shark machhliyon ko maine chakma diyasheron ko maine chakayamujhe jinhone hadap liyaave khatmal the

 com / k3wvlw2ko9 Sapna Choudhary's name is not an identity of any identity today

 hindi filmon main bhi specialsong kar rahi he or ab punjabi gaanon kaa swag badhaane ke liye bhi sapana (sapna Choudhary), logon kii pehali pasand bani hui hai
 Sapna is constantly in the headlines
 id ke maukey par sapana, wasim shaikh kii nai album main dikhain di
 In this album, not only Sapna did a tremendous dance but also gave her voice
 sapana choudhary (sapna Choudhary) kaa nayaa song nachke dikhaa de relies hote hi soshal media par chaa gaya

 Sapna Chaudhary's fans are commenting fiercely on this video shared on the t-series channel on youtube
 kuch log gane ke liriks kii tarif kar rahe hai to kuch mujeec kii
 But most of the comments are about Sapna Choudhary and her looks
 sapana choudhary kaa utyub sanseshan yun hi nahin kehete hai
 His songs continue to trend on social media every day

 After 'bigg Boss', his success graph continued to rise

 Overall, this dance video of him has created a boom
 mere whatsap ke inbox main subah se 500 se adhik massej aa chuke hai
 Fed up with the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh government exams, these youngsters are sending typed messages minute by minute
 un tamaam massej main kashmir par ek shabd nahin he
 Kashmir is not among his concerns
 sarkari pariksha kaa riselt nahin niklaa he or naukari nahin mil rahi he, isliye khud ko udhaas bataate hai or kuch to jivan khatm kar lene kii baat karte hai
 There is talk of media being sold in many messages
 unka kahana he ki main hi unka ekmaatr sahaara hum jo unki baat karata hum
 stop
 is baat ke aadhaar par aap yah bhram na paalen ki ye noujvaan media ke bikne or tatasth hone kii gahari samaj rakhte hai
 If their understanding about the media was clear, then it is said that the media has been strangled in Kashmir, similarly by suppressing our voice, we have also been made like Kashmir
 ve na apane liye media kii azaadi maangate hai or na kashmir ke liye
 Because then they have to understand how difficult it is for their own elected government to be media
 ve us raajnneeti kii awaz banate hai jo media kii awaz ko khatm karti he or baad main unki bhi awaz ko khatm kar detii he
 Kashmir has a population of 125 million
 upi, bihar or madhya pradesh kii sarkari parikshaon ke sataae naujavaanon kii sankhya kashmir kii aabaadi se adhik he
 This does not include the number of Group d candidates of Railways
 itani badi sankhya main noujvaan media ke spes se baahar kar die gaye hai
 They are suffering
 minute-minute mujhe massej kar rahe hai ki main prime time main inaki awaz uthaaun
 Not even once do i ask that i discuss Kashmir
 meri time line main kashmir kii baat hi nahin he
 It is a matter of job and those who talk about jobs are similar to Kashmir
 ve bhi kashmir kii tarah suchnavihin pradesh main rah rahe hai
 Neither the government talks to them and the media talks to them
 main in naujavaanon kii maansik pareshaani se bahut dukhi hum
 There is a prick before deleting all the messages
 kitni ummid or takaleef se guzar kar kisi ne yah likhaa hoga
 i know that i can do nothing
 fasebuk par likh detaa hum
 They become happy with that
 main kashmir ke baahar ke in naujavaanon ko kashmir kii tarah suchnavihin or ummidavihin hote dekh rahaa hum
 i don't feel good ye noujvaan achche hai
 What are they being punished for? kya isaki sazaa di ja rahi he ki ye media or sarkaar ke khel ko nahin samajhate hai
 i do not pick up the phone, yet after midnight there is still a number flashing on the phone
 ajeeb sa sannata pasar jaataa he
 How upset any young man will be on that side of the line
 vah har taraf se thak gaya he
 After messaging on the ministers twitter handle, it has come to my inbox
 main saikadon phone nahin uthaa saktaa
 Occasionally, the youth who should talk to Gurur are pleading
 ro rahe hote hai
 i have not been to Kashmir, but the sobs of the youth there seem to be like the sobs of the youth of North India
 bas main kashmir ke naujavaanon ke sampark main nahin hum
 The youth of UP and Madhya Pradesh are in contact with me
 editors gild ne ek bayaan jari kiya he
 Information is banned in Kashmir
 sthaneey media ko report karne nahin diya ja rahaa he jo zamin par logon kii aankh or kaan hote hai
 Unbiased reporting and freedom of the press has ended
 bina internet ke khabaron ko pahunchaana sambhav nahin he
 This government knows
 kashmir main jis tarah ke halaat hai vahaan par press kaa loktantric daayitv nibhaana zaruri he
 Journalists are being stopped in the name of the pass
 maine yah baat isliye likhi he ki taaki mujhe massej karne vaale naujavaanon ko kashmir kaa mudda mil jaae
 They will start crowding the editors guild's statement and support the freedom of the press
 yah ho jayega to isse sarkaar kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 i have no hope from these young men
 phir bhi inase ek moh he
 My close ones refuse not to write about them, i will still keep writing about them
 inaki naukari kii baat karuunga
 Is it a crime to expect them to support the freedom of media? If it is, then these youngsters will keep messaging me, if not then they will stop messaging from tomorrow
 vaise aaj kai parikshaon ke sataae naujavaanon ne patr likhaa he
 i know that you have no sympathy with Kashmir
 unki bahu betiyon ke saath kuch bhi karne kii baat karne waalon ko aap nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Still i want to keep a list
 maine sirf is ek lekh main kareeb 8 lakh naujavaanon kii pidaa darj kii he
 But their number has changed to zero
 inhen pehle se pataa he ki shunya ho chuke hai
 They have become zero towards themselves
 kashmir inke liye shunya ho chukaa he
 i can tell from a sample of 8 lakh youth that none of them are concerned about Kashmir
 kam se kam apane massej main nahin likhaa he
 None of these are concerned about the freedom of media
 kya inhen naukari mil jaaegi? main chaahunga ki mili
 i cannot throw their messages completely into the junk as the governments have thrown
 aapako bataaya to ki mujhe inase moh he
 i would like Narendra Modi, Adityanath and Kamal Nath to give jobs to eight lakh youth of UP and Madhya Pradesh
 aakhir kashmir kaa punargathan bhi sarkari naukariyon main bhartee ke liye kiya gaya he
 Then why are the youth of UP and Madhya Pradesh not getting government jobs
 mujhase lagaataar puche jane vaale 4 prashnon ke jawaab-aashaa he naukari series par mere lekh likhane ke baad mere parichit is tarah ke prashn nahin karenge
 It is expected that millions of youth will not raise their voice on media freedom
 aashaa he ki ve raveesh kumaar ko apni awaz uthaane ke liye patr likhte rahenge
 i am full of hopes
 main zindaa hum
 Those who are not alive know that

 Astuti Chalisa Shivhi, Purna Keen Kalyan mark jakarberg ne haal hi main kaha tha ki fasebuk hameshaa ke liye free rahegaa
 Also, the Facebook head also said that the possibilities of bringing a paid version of it can be considered
 ab haal hi main ek report main daawa kiya gaya he ki jald hi fasebuk kaa ek ped varjan launch kiya ja saktaa he
 According to a Bloomberg report, Facebook is conducting a research for a subscription Besmodel
 taaki ye pataa lagaaya ja sake ki kya yugers apni privesi ke liye paise kharch karne ko taiyaar hai
 However, a Facebook spokesperson has not commented on this for now
 pichley kuch samay se fasebuk ke sabsakripshan besd model ko lekar kaaphi charchaaen thim, jisamen yugers company ko paise dekar apane privesi kii suraksha sunishchit kar sakate hai
 Currently Facebook is free for all users but the company collects the data of the users
 inhen data kaa upyog kar vigyapandaata apane target yugers tak vigyaapane pahunchaate hai
 But since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a new debate has arisen over data
 iske baad se hi fasebuk kaaphi dabaav main he
 Significantly, some time ago Mark Zuckerberg appeared in the US Senate to answer questions
 us dauraan jab kaaphi saansadon dwaara mark jakarberg se ye poocha gaya ki kya ve fasebuk kaa ek aid-free varjan laane kii bare main sochate hai, jo ped bhi ho
 So while answering this question, Zuckerberg told MP Orin Hatch that a free version of Facebook will always be present, while a paid version can be thought of

 film ko shri narayan singh diarect kar rahe hai
 a news is spreading like wildfire in Jharkhand these days that Dev Kumar Singh alias Arvind, the most feared Naxalite leader of CPI Maoist, died
 uski umr mahaj 53 saal thi
 It is said that he was the mastermind of violent Naxalites
 is naksali ko 9 rajyon kii police talash kar rahi thi
 The death of a heart attack police has not found the body of Arvind
 sutron kii maane tonksalservind kai maah se biimaar tha
 Arvind died on Wednesday at 10 am on the old mountain
 udhar is babat puche jane par gadwa ke espi ne kaha ki jab tak shav nahin mil jaataa tab tak maut kii pushti aadhikarik rup se nahin kii ja sakati
 Surrender to Naxalites, the SP also said that the police were constantly trying to surrender the ailing Arvind, the police would treat him, but he did not do so
 espi ne anya naksaliyon se apil karte hue kaha ki abhi bhi jo naksali boodha pahaad par kabiz hai wo sarender kar de
 The state government placed a reward of one crore rupees on Arvind's head
 bataaya jaataa he ki naksali netaa arvind lambey samay se biimaar chal rahaa tha or oxigen par tha
 Old mountain is the stronghold of the Naxalites
 For the last two years, along with their companions, they were making their permanent hideout on the old mountain
 boodha pahaad jharkhand or chhatisgarh kii seemaa par gadwa jile main he
 Police has also been campaigning continuously for two years to liberate this mountain from the Naxalites
 boodha pahaad paranksaliyonko gherne ke liye kareeb 2000 suraksha bal ke jawan deraa daale hue hai
 There have been several reports that Arvind ji has been surrounded by security forces
 lekin, yah naksali netaa kabhi police yaa suraksha balon ke hathe nahin chadha
 Farakh Ali Gayen is 22 years old and just over five feet tall
 dekhne main zyada prabhaavshaalee bhi nahin lagata
 He is the son of an owner of a tea shop in South 24 Parganas, the largest district in West Bengal
 is jile ko 2006 main desh ke 250 ''sabase pichde jilon" main se ek ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 But Farrak was earning well
 uske khate main 13 lakh ru
 Were accumulated
 uski umr ke yuva ke liye yah khaasi badi rakam thi
 Farrak is now in police custody
 usne sweekaar kiya he ki vah ladakiyon kaa apharan karke unhen bechney kaa dhandha karata he
 The younger the girls, the more she benefited
 lekin aisi kharid-farokht karne vaala vah akelaa shaks nahin he
 Since 2014, 16,000 girls have gone missing from South 24 Parganas district
 ek enjio shakti vahini ke anusaar, pichley 18 maheenon main kareeb 300 ladakiyon ko mukt karaayaa gaya or 50 maanav taskaron ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Nobel Prize-awarded child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi started a 35-day nationwide march on 11 September demanding action against human trafficking
 satyaarthee kaa kahana tha ki ve balaatkaar, utpeeda va taskari ke khilaaf khuli jang ched rahe hai
 They say that sexual exploitation of children is a moral epidemic ‚Äî our silence is fueling this violence
 pichley maheene raashtrapati ram nath kovind se mulaakaat main satyaarthee ne rashtriya bal panchat sthapit kiye jane kii bhi maang rakhi
 Farrakh confessed that he was attracted to the business of human trafficking due to easy earnings
 use dilli main apni bahan ke rahan-sahan se rashk hota tha‚Äîaaleeshaan ghar, mahange kapade or haath main hameshaa noton kii gaddiyaan
 Farrak said, "I was told that i too can become a money-giver like my brother-in-law Radhey
" iske liye mujhe itnaa karnaa tha ki gaanv se ladkiyaan lekar aani thi or main har ladki par 20,000 rupye se 50,000 rupye tak kama saktaa tha
 "farrakh roams in local villages on his Hero Karizma motorbike and sells his 40,000
 ke mobile phone, ghadi va dhoop ke chashme kii chamak dikhaata rahata tha
 For girls in that poor area, she was a golden dream model, with whom she kept exploring the possibility of escape
 babitha kii umr 16 saal kii thi
 She was a natural victim of the trap of deception
 use uskaa number mobile richarge point se mila (dhandhebaaj har number ke liye sau rupye tak de dete hai)
 Farrak made 15 calls, when Kabita agreed to meet him at Mathurapur railway station
 vahaan se use dilli le jaaya gaya
 Babita, like most girls who were victims of this type of horse-trading, fainted because she was fed some intoxicant in something to eat and drink
 dilli main faraakh ne use apni bahan ke supurd kar diya jisane phir use agra ke ek kothe par bech diya
 Babita said, "I was put in a place where there were small rooms and no windows
 dinabhar hamen taale main band rakhaa jaataa tha
 Used only to please customers
 kisi-kisi din to 15-20 graahak nibatane padate the or agar ham kisi ko bhi manaa karte the to hamaari bahut pitayee hoti thi
 One day i took a customer's phone and told my family that i am in Agra
 "parivaar ne isaki soochna shakti vahini ko di or phir use chhudaane kii yojana banaai gai
 Babita was not recognized as her face had changed from the photo given to the rescue team
 shakti vahini ke rishikant ko aisi hi sthitiyon se ladakiyon ko bachaane ke kaam main 20 saal kaa anubhav he
 They say that often the children are given injections of drugs and hormones so that they can get teenage soon
 isse unka vajan bad jaataa he or ve badi lagane lagati hai
 Babita and six other girls from her own district were rescued from the brothel in mid-july
 maanav taskaron ke changul se chhudaayi jane vaali har das ladakiyon main se chah pashchim bengal se hoti hai
 The trafficking of children, especially for the sex trade, is flourishing
 kendriya grih mantralay ke anumaanon ke anusaar, har saal kam se kam ek lakh bachche laapata ho jate hai
 The Global March Against Child Labor (global March Against Child Labor) quoted Kailash Satyarthi in a report on professional sexual exploitation, that $ 360 billion, or Rs 21 lakh crore, would have been made in the business of enslaving young girls to the brothels
 Huh
 bal shram ke khilaaf apane kaam ke liye 2014 main nobel shanti puraskaar jeetne vaale satyaarthee ne ingit kiya ki ukt raashi desh ke jidipi ke 20 fisadi ke baraabar he
 The report, published in 2014 by Satyarthi's NGO Global March Against Child Labor, estimated the figure to be at least $ 35 billion, or 2 per cent of GDP
 satyaarthee kehete hai ki yah kaala dhan bacchiyon va auraton ke khilaaf sabase ghrunit aparaadhon ko janm detaa he
 Most of the victims of these crimes are among the poorest states in India, including Assam, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 haal ke saalon main logon kii aay main vruddhi ke saath hi sex ke vyapaar main bhi badhotaree hui he
 In many areas of the cities, secret rooms have now started flourishing
 global march against child lebar ke anusaar, veshyavriti ke liye maanav taskari kaa shikaar hone vaale logon main 90 fisadi se zyada auraten yaa bacchiyaan hoti hai
 India is also a supplier of demand, a demand-generating and transit point in this trade
 yani yon vyapaar ke liye ladkiyaan bharat se baahar bheji jaati hai, baahar se bharat laai bhi jaati hai or taskar kisi desh se duusare desh main ladakiyon ko bhejne ke dauraan unhen kuch samay bharat main rakhte bhi hai
 Girls are sent from India to about 18 countries
 vaise bal adhikaron ke liye echekue centre kii 2016 kii report main yah saamne aayaa tha ki bharat main bacchiyon kii 90 fisadi taskari aantarik he or isaki shikaar bacchiyaan bharat ke saamaajik va aarthik str par sabase nichle tabake se aati hai
 The HAQ report also said that the increase in smuggling was due to better connectivity, more traffic and faster urbanization
 zyaadaatar agent jinhen dalal va madam kahana zyada uchit hoga, peediton ko nikat ke shahari ilaakon main kaalpanik naukariyon ke laalach main fansaate hai
 Another trap used by smugglers is a fake marriage proposal
 khaastaur par punjab va haryana jaise uttari rajyon main yah hatkandaa apanaaya jaataa he
 Atia Bose of Aangan, an NGO engaged in the work of rehabilitating victims of sexual trafficking, says that poor families, in particular, fall prey to such proposals
 ye parivaar aisa sochakar kaaphi raahat main aa jate hai ki hone vaala duulhaa kisi taam-jhaam vaali shaadi yaa dahej main koi ruchi nahin rakhata
 They fail to perceive this reluctance as a threat
 iske ulat, duulhe kaa parivaar hi aisi ladki ke parivaar ko uskaa haath dene ke badale main kuch dhan dene ko taiyaar rahata he
 In such fake weddings, girls first become maids for the "groom" and his entire family, and are then sold to a buyer
 ab mobile phonon ke jariye internet kaa prachlan itnaa bad gaya he ki dhandhebaaj fasebuk jaisi soshal media citon kaa istemaal bhi jaal failaane ke liye karne lage hai
 Kant of Shakti Vahini says that recently she saved a girl from Nagaland when she had already boarded an airplane and was going to meet the smuggler who made a false Facebook profile and made a lot of false promises to her
 
 ve bataate hai ki unhen akele jharkhand main hi yon taskari se jude lagbhag 300 whatsap grupon kii jaankaree he
 Kant says that Jharkhand is a hunting ground for smugglers
 rajya kii zyaadaatar aabaadi garib or ashikshit he
 Therefore, tribal girls up to the age of ten years are being sold at the brothels
 rajdhani ranchi se mahaj 25 kilometre dur or maovadi-naksalwadi prabhaav vaale kathith ''red coridor" main shaamil khunty jile se hi haal hi main 79 maanav taskaron ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 The Global March Against Child Labor states that 70% of Indian girls sold in the sex trade are between the ages of 16 and 18 and are usually kept hidden for 12 to 18 months to protect and rehabilitate them
 The process becomes quite complicated
 peediton kii umr bhartiya yon vyapaar kii ek or kaali hakeekat kii ore ishaara karti he‚Äîzyaadaatar peediton ko unke parivaar hi taskaron ke haathon bech daalate hai
 Businessmen themselves are very young, in many cases just 18 to 19 years old
 teen saal pehle ek kukhyat maanav taskar pannalaal va uski patni ko dilli main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He had several serious charges besides smuggling minors from remote areas of Jharkhand
 media main ai kai jaankariyon main pannalaal kii sampatti 66 karod ru
 It was estimated that he had acquired 10,000 girls from Jharkhand, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh for "work"
 is dhandhe main paise kii chaal haroonges he
 The Global March Against Child Labor says that a brothel annually 1
 5 karod ru
 From 14
 4 karod ru
 Earns between is samooche kaarobaar main hi 2 lakh se 21 lakh karod ru
 (see graphic)
 itani baari-bharkam raashi se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kyon bacchon kii taskari par rajnatik rukh itnaa udasin rahata he
 a 2003 study by the National Human Rights Commission, the United Nations Women's Development Fund, and the Institute of Social Sciences estimated that 20 percent of minors were minors
 behad baichaiyn karne vaali baat yah he ki bahut saare bacchon par khatra mandara rahaa he or isse nibatane ke intjaam naakaafi hai
 However, some people working at the ground level also say that the attitude of both the police and government officials is slowly changing
 varanasi sthit enjio gudinga ke ajit singh teen dashakon se maanav taskari ke shikaar bacchon ko bachaane or unke punarvaas main lage hai
 In 1988, he "adopted" three children of a sex worker and started paying for their upbringing
 us samay ve mahaj 17 saal ke the
 Ajit Singh is currently fighting cases against 803 smugglers in Uttar Pradesh
 ajit jaanate hai ki ve nishane par hai
 His office is also his office located in the narrow streets of Khajuri Colony, Varanasi
 vahaan sab taraf filein jamaa hai
 They have installed a strong steel door and the house is equipped with state-of-the-art security system
 ek lohe kaa get bhi he
 Due to threats from the family, this man has to teach his daughter at home
 unhen jaan se maarane kii dhamkiyaan milti rahi hai or unke saathiyon ko bhi peeta jaataa rahaa he
 But even then the government does not feel any need to protect them
 ve kehete hai, ''pehle to yon vyapaar kii koi avadharana hi nahin thi
 At least now people are talking about it
 baat karnaa hi samaadhaan khoj nikaalane kii shuruyaat he
 "ajit believes that the efforts of civil society have made some difference
 ''maine jab sadakon par virodh karnaa shuru kiya tha to adhikariyon kaa buniyadi ravaiya yahi rahata tha ki ye mahilaayein to aisi hi hai, inhen lock-ap main phenkakar band kar dena chahie
 We also fought against this attitude
 hamane ise maanavadhikaar kaa mudda banane ke liye ladaai ladi
 We now have anti-human trafficking units, an advisory committee and are ready to introduce a new law
 jahaan kuch nahin tha, vahaan itnaa kuch he
 "sometimes so little optimism and pessimism goes up
 may 2015 main puduccheri police ke aath afasaron ko un chaar bacchon ke balaatkaar ke aarope main barkhaast kar diya gaya tha jinhen maanav taskaron se chhudaaya gaya tha
 Still, Triveni Acharya of the Rescue Foundation, an NGO helping rehabilitate child sex workers in Mumbai, says the changing attitude of the police is the most positive change she has seen recently
 ve kahati hai, ''pehle, police va netaa shaayad yah maanate the ki veshyavriti rahegi to balaatkaar kam honge
 Thankfully the police has become more sensitive now
 prashikshan kaaryakramon, aiti-trephiking cell or vishesh adaalaton se bhi isamen madad mili he
 After Nirbhaya (delhi gang rape victim on 16 December 2012), the law has become even more true
 ab agar kisi choti bacchee ko bachaaya jaataa he to tatkaal karrwai hoti he
 "better police or at least better intentions have now started appearing in South 24 Parganas district where women police officers have gone to 3,200 schools and talked about child trafficking
 skulon main ab dibbe lagaae gaye hai jisamen ladkiyaan kisi bhi utpeeda ke khilaaf shikaayat likhakar daal sakati hai
 Kant says that the Shakti Vahini and the police are forming "self-determination" teams that include both students and teachers
 ye timen ladakiyon ko maanav taskari ke bare main jaagruk karti hai, unhen video dikhaati hai or seminar yojit karti hai
 He says, "we educate girls so that they can recognize the danger and be vigilant
" " ve online privesi kii suraksha ke bare main schuli bacchiyon ko shikshit karne ke liye ity chaatro kii bhi madad le rahe hai
 About 350 schools in South 24 Parganas district have already associated themselves with the self-determination program
 angan main atiya bose kaa bhi mukhya kaam bachaav yani saamudayik nigaraanee samooh taiyaar karnaa he, jo ye samajhate hon ki maanav taskar kaise kaam karte hai
 But much remains to be done
 ve kahati hai, ''har jagah sarkaar ke maujuud hone kii apeksha karnaa avyavhaarik he
 We tell communities how to be aware
 " lekin tamaam achche kaamon or ashavad ke baavjood maahaul chintajanak hi he
 Despite admitting that it lacked authentic data, the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development told Parliament in March that in 2016, around 20,000 women and girls were trafficked
 yah sankhya pichley saal se 25 fisadi zyada thi
 However, many officials argue that this increase is not due to increase in smuggling but more awareness and better reporting of cases
 lekin hakeekat yah he ki maanav taskaron ko sajaa dilaae jane kii dar mahaj 2 se 5 fisadi he jo ki behad niraashajanak he
 According to Sanjog Roop Sen, an organization that works for child protection, gender justice and social equality, investigators do not get any incentive to catch such sex traffickers
 acharya isse sahmati jataate hai, ''udhaaharan ke liye jab duusare rajyon yaa deshon se ladakiyon ko mumbai laayaa jaataa he, to mumbai police ke paas koi adhikaar yaa nyaayadhikaar nahin hota ki vah vahaan jaae or girakratari kare
 Interstate investigations and cooperation need to be improved
 " is bich, maanav taskari rokane ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye ek vidheyak ke masaude ko sex workaron sahit anek logon kii aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, kyonki isamen trutiyaan hai or spashtataa nahin he
 In this, the sex worker is treated as a sexual trafficker
 sarvocch nyaayalay kii vakil aparnaa bhatta tark detii hai ki kisi bhi nae kanoon ke centre main bachche hona chahie
 Right now our law is focused on prosecution, but the victims in it are usually absent
 har koi is baat se sahamat he ki ek nae kanoon kii jarurat he
 The objective of the Human Trafficking (prevention) Bill is to create an institutional machinery under the Central Government to consider the issue of human trafficking based on the information received from all parties under the guidance and authority of the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development

 maanav taskari se nibatane ke liye susangat or ekikrut ranneeti tathaa javabdehiyon ke spasht nirdhaaran ke abhaav main anischitata kii sthiti he
 The lack of data is also hampering evidence based planning
 sen kehete hai, ''police saamaanya chhapemari kar itishree kar leti he, kyonki uske paas aavashyak gyaan nahin he
 ‚Äúrehabilitation is the challenge
 kuch gyaat anumaanon ke mutabik, police kii kasar ke kaaran naaballigon ko teen se paanch varsh tak kaid main rahanaa hota he
 After a prolonged period of prostitution, there is a hurdle in returning to normal life and reconnecting with society, so many young women turn to prostitution again despite being freed
 bose kehete hai, ''un ladakiyon ko madad kii jarurat he
 We need to allocate funds for their rehabilitation
 " mahila evam bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ne email se die jawaab main kaha, ''peedit kaa punarvaas vidheyak kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 "he wrote," The bill has a complete framework, including details of the Victims Compensation Fund

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is once again preparing to exit Delhi
 is baar party gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main utar sakati he
 According to sources, AAP may contest in a few select seats in Gujarat
 gopal raay pahunche gujaratsutron ne bataaya ki party ke gujarat pramukh gopal raay rajya main hai
 Their meeting with local leaders has started
 iske saath hi vah party ke kaaryakartaaon se bhi mil rahe hai
 According to sources, this time the party has made up its mind to contest in some seats in Gujarat
 aise main sambhav he ki gopal raay isi kii taiyaari ke liye yahaan pahunche hai
 AAP has laid down three conditions
 The Aam Aadmi Party has kept three things for the candidates who want to contest the election, first of which the candidate will be able to give a tough competition in the election under all circumstances
 to vahiin duusari shart he ki ummidavaar bhashtraachaari naa ho yani us par bhashtrachaar ke aarope nahin hone chahie
 Also, the third condition is that the candidate should not be a criminal
 yani saaf suthri chhavi vaala hona chahie
 The aap's slogan for Gujarat will be in front of the election slogan of the BJP and the Congress, based on the theme of the Aam Aadmi Party's slogan "gujarat's resolution, you are the right choice"
 iske alaava 'ek mauka aap ko phir dekho gujarat ko' jo purana naaraa he vah bhi jari rahegaa
 Party released helpline number, Hoga Road Show will be Aam Aadmi Party's road show on 17 September
 vahiin aam aadmi party ne 7818810810 ek helpline number diya gaya he
 Through this number, people can give both suggestions and funds to the party
 haalanki ab bhi aam aadmi party ne ye saaf nahin kiya he ki wo kitni siton par apane ummidavaar khadey rakhegi
 The party has tried in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party had earlier contested the Punjab assembly elections
 lekin vahaan use karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Before the election, the party claimed that it would capture all the seats in the assembly, but the Aam Aadmi Party could not even cross the figure of 20
 ye bhi padhein :bavana upachunaav main jeet se AAP gadgad, bijepi ne sweekaari haaraparty ke liye aasaan nahin hoga gujaratgujarat vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ke liye jeet hasil karnaa kaaphi chunauteepurn sabit ho saktaa he
 The state currently has a BJP government
 yahaan par bhaajapa kaaphi majboot sthiti main he
 On the other hand, it is also the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aise main ‚Äòaap‚Äô ke liye yahaan chunavi jang aasaan nahin hogi
 Also read: Relief from Delhi HC to AAP, lg's decision to cancel allotment of party office may be rejected
 It may be because the Aam Aadmi Party will not want the same situation in Gujarat as it did in Punjab
 sambhav he ki isliye hi party yahaan chuninda siton par hi chunaav lard rahi he
 Winning or losing these seats will help the party to understand the mood of the people and on this basis the party can formulate its strategy for Rajyad

 a picture has gone viral on social media, in which some people are catching people's feet on the way
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ye chaatr sangh chunaav main vot paane kaa netaaon kaa nayaa formula he
 They don't look like beggars, they don't even look like clothes

 Why are they catching the feet of the people coming? is raste main chalane waalon kii saansat ho ja rahi he
 Whose listen, not whose listen, because everyone here is folding hands, holding feet

 Pictures of these white-clad fakirs are becoming very viral on social media

 According to what was claimed on social media, these photos are from the Kashi Vidyapeeth Students Union elections
 in tasveeron main dikh rahe chaatr netaa voter chaatro ke paanv pakad rahe hai
 Student leaders are begging for votes from students
 to kya shiksha ke mandir main raajnneeti itani patit ho gai ki chaatr netaa vot ke liye ab paanv pakadaney lage
 Even if the student leader is a student, is it really a student holding the feet of another student and begging for votes? ye khabar hamaare liye chaunkaane vaali thi

 Now call it the downfall of student politics or the picture of politics holding the earth, the candidates standing in the student union elections have done wonders
 ye netaa kabhi chaatro ke pairon ko pakadakar vot maangate dikhe to kabhi haath jodakar vot maangate dikhe
 Interestingly, the policemen were passing through them, but their attention was elsewhere
 in dharti pakad netaaon ke is karname ke chalate vot dene aae chaatro ko chaar-paanch minute kaa rasta 15 minute main puraa karnaa padaa
 Some of them are justifying taking blessings by holding feet in Navratri, while some are saying that they will do whatever they have to do to make a political career
 isi ke saath hi kaashi viapeeth chaatr sangh chunaav kii tasviir or usase judi ye khabar hamaare viral test main paas ho gai

 punjab police ne ek soochna ke aadhaar par pathankot se irshaad naam ke shaks ko giraftaar kiya he
 Irshad is said to be an agent of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, which managed to get a job inside Pathankot Cantt
 phone se mili samvedansheel tasvirenirashaad ne pathankot main maimum kaint ke andar ek majdoor kii naukari hasil kar lee thi
 Intelligence agencies have recovered a smart phone from him, in which several sensitive photos of the institute have been found
 pathankot kaint, bhartiya sena ke sabase bade or samvedansheel military beson main se ek he
 a division of the Indian Army is based here, consisting of Infantry Battalion and Cavalry
 ab bhi nishane par pathankotye giraftaar bharat kii intelligence agenciyon ke liye kaaphi ahm he kyonki pichley dinon pathankot hamale ke baad ye kshetra ab bhi aatankiyon ke nishane par bana hua he
 In most cases, the ISI selects a new target after targeting a location as security is increased once it is attacked
 jaanch main juty agenciyanintelligence agenciyaan ab jaanch kar rahi hai ki irshaad ko kahaan se nirdesh die ja rahe the
 The agencies are also investigating whether Irshad played any role in the Pathankot airbase attack
 pichley kai saalon se bihar kii satta se dur rahaa rashtriya janata dal (rajd) vartmaan rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii sarkaar ke khilaaf bhale hi lagaataar hamalaa karata rahaa ho, parantu pehali baar 15 may ko hone vaali parivartan raily ke madhyam se vah khulkar saamne aane vaala he
 Through this rally, where the RJD will also try to explore the graph of its mass base, this rally will also give a message to the workers to prepare for the Lok Sabha elections with renewed enthusiasm
 aise rajd ke rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad raily dwaara raajnneeti karne ke liye prarambh se hi charchit rahe hai
 Lalu has organized about a dozen rallies so far, in which rallies like Garib Rally, Garib Raila, Lathi Rally, Tel Pilavan Rally, Alert Rally have been widely discussed but there is a difference between old rallies and this Parivartan rally
 rajd dwaara jab bhi reliyon kaa aayojan kiya gaya he, tab vah satta main rahaa he or pehali baar party vipaksh main rahakar raily kaa aayojan kar rahi he
 However, Lalu has tried to find the pulse of people by moving around the state on the pretext of preparing for the Parivartan rally and inviting the people of the state to participate in the rally
 is dauraan yojit aamasabha main judi baari bheed ne rajd netaaon ko utsahit kiya he, isamen koi do raay nahin he
 It is noteworthy that after the NDA returned to power for the second time, Lalu decided to remain silent for a long time
 rajd ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki vipaksh main rahane ke baad raily main bheed juta paanaa aasaan kaam nahin he parantu aaj bhi party ko apane kaaryakartaaon par bharosa he
 Experts believe that Lalu has been treating the crowds attending rallies as strength
 is kaaran raily main bheed jutaney ke maamle main party ke netaa koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chahenge
 The crowd will gather in the rally in the summer season, it will be known on May 15, but the people of the ruling party are also keeping a close watch on this rally
 rajd ke saansad or mahasachiv ramkripal yadav kehete hai ki raily ke liye puri taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 He alleged that the officers have started working on the instructions of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to avoid crowds in the rally
 rajdhani main lage postaron ko hataaya ja rahaa he
 However, he believes that 10 lakh people will reach the rally and from that day the countdown of the Bihar government will start
 idhar, satta paksh ke log raily ko viraasat sthanantaran kii kavayad kah rahe hai
 Janata dal-united (JD-U) spokesperson Sanjay Singh says that by wearing the mask of Parivartan rally, Lalu is actually organizing the ceremony of change in family persecution
 vah kehete hai ki lalu apane donon putron ko raajnneeti main laane vaale hai, isi kaaran yah aayojan kiya gaya he
 RJD leaders used to revolve around S1 and S2 (sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav) and now Lalu is going to transfer his status and legacy to T1 and T2 (tejaswa and Tej Pratap) under so-called politics
 vaise, rajd ke netaa is raily ke madhyam se afasarshahi, dushkarm kii ghatnaon main vruddhi, mahangaai, belgaum vidhi vyavastha, niojit or vitt rahit shikshakon ko mudda banaakar vartmaan sarkaar par hamalaa karenge
 Knowledgeable, however, consider this rally as a trailer of the RJD before the Lok Sabha elections and consider it as an exercise to garner mass base

 On the defeat in the by-election, state president Dilip Ghosh said that in the bye-election, the results are in favor of those who are in power in the state because the police and administration take advantage of power, we are evaluating the defeat of Kharagpur Sadar seat
 loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha upachunaav main kaaphi antar hota he, log vidhansabha upachunaav ko gambhirtha se nahin lete hai
 The outcome of 2021 will be different, in 2021 people will forget, the issue and condition will change
 upachunaav kii jeet par TMC kii mahua moitra ne kaha ki ham logon ko dhanyavad dete hai, mukhyamantri ne kaam kii he, itnaa kaam kiya he janata ne uske aadhaar par vot diya he, desh ke jo halaat hai log samaj gaye hai
 At the same time, Mahua Moitra hit back at Dilip Ghosh's statement, "all the people were with him, the police were all in his possession, the elephant is going from above, it is not my job to answer, we will win even 56 inches
 "while Congress MP p Bhattacharya said that tmc's victory was due to NRC, TMC got all the refugia votes
 bhaajapa NRC ke kaaran chunaav main haare hai
 Significantly, the by-elections were held on November 25 in three seats of the assembly in West Bengal (bengal Bypoll)
 bengal main 2021 main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone vaale hai

 aaj ham kah sakate hai ki NSG commando hamararial hero hai or aisa maananaa or sochna swaabhaavik hi he
 For the last two decades, whether it is fighting suicide suicide attacks or decrying any major action by terrorists, the NSG commandos have proved to be the only troublemakers of every such crisis
 enesji ke commandos hamaare desh main suraksha ke antim paryaay hai
 The most important thing about NSG commandos is their action at an accelerated pace and the elimination of targets
 apane gathan ke baad se aaj tak enesji commando do darjan se zyada khatarnaak opareshnon ko anjaam de chuke hai
 They have not failed in any operation till date
 inkaa ekmaatr lakshya hota he, har haal main safalataa
 Any operation of the NSG is carried out at such a rapid pace that the enemy does not get any chance to think about it
 conmado ne kiye demo oparation1
 On the occasion of its foundation day, the NSG showed several types of anti high jacking operations
 isamen sabase pehle NSG ke oparation main shaamil thim conot place kaa laa plaza restaurant jisko aatankiyon ne hijank kar liya NSG ke commando ne badi hi tatparta ke saath is restaurant ko aatankiyon se mukt karaayaa
 2
 aatankiyo ne vrundavan ja rahi bas ko hijac kar liya jisko safal oparation ke jariye NSG ke commando ne dikhaaya ki kaise aatankiyo se bandhakon ko mukt karaate hai
 3
 enesji is samay 15 VIP ko suraksha de rahi he
 In its operation, the NSG showed how Black Cat commandos protect vips when attacked

 Anti-high jacking is proving to be a boon for the jawans in the operation
 demo main dikhaaya gaya ki america se kharida mars anti hijacking vical kya he or kaise kaam karata he

 NSG ne belgian melonois kism ke dog ko apane oparation ke bede main shaamil kiya he, jo har ek oparation main blike cat commando ke saath saaye kii tarah shaamil rahete hai
 How to become NSG Training of each commando of NSG is very difficult
 jis training kasbse bada maksandhik se adhik yogya logon kaa NSG main chayan hona hota he
 For this, the first recruits who are selected for commandos are the best soldiers of their respective armies
 iske baad bhi unka chayan kai charnon se guzar kar hota he
 In the end, when these soldiers reach Manesar for training, they are the most precious and brave soldiers of the country
 training centre pahunchane ke baad bhi koi sainik antim rup se commando ban hi jaae yah jaruri nahin he

 The Modi government at the Center has decided to give reservation to upper castes on economic basis
 kendriya cabinet kii somvaar ko hui baithak main faisla liya gaya ki aarthik rup se kamjor savarna jatiyon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan diya jayega
 But those who have a strong opinion on Dalit issues believe that the Bharatiya Janata Party has taken this step in despair
 iskaa use raajnneetik laabh milane nahin ja rahaa he
 Senior journalist and author on dalit-adivasi issues, Anil Chamadia says, "BJP is in a state of despair over the recent assembly elections in five states
" in rajyon main bijepi kii haar ko savarnon kii naaraazgi ke taur par prachaarit-prasaarit kiya gaya
 After the nationwide protests of Bahujan Samaj on 2 April 2018, the Modi government had to step in force on the Supreme Court's decision against the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act (SC / ST Act)
 modi sarkaar ne supreme court ke faisle ko palata or kanoon kii puraani sthiti ko behaal kiya
 'anil Chamadia says, but the BJP has been in a dilemma about this decision because its vote base is among the upper castes
 kai jagah savarna jatiyon ne essi / asti act ke khilaaf apana virodh bhi darj karaayaa
 In this context, the Modi government has taken this anti-constitutional decision to bail itself out from these conditions
 vah yah bhi kehete hai, bhagava party hameshaa bahujan samaaj ko baantne kaa kaam karti he
 On the one hand, by dividing the constitutionally reserved reservation into different parts, it creates division among the Bahujans, on the other hand, the Savarnas are trying to make their vote bank solid by leaving the Shigufa of reservation
 anil chamadiya kehete hai ki bijepi 1991 ke baad se hi bahujan ekta ko todane kii koshish karti rahi he
 The BJP and other Hinduist organizations gave a boost to the temple movement only to deactivate the reservation
 bijepi ke niraashaa main kadam uthaae jane kii anil chamadiya kii raay se dalit netaa devashish jaraariya bhi sahmati jataate hai
 Jararia said that the bjp-led central government, which was surrounded by all the criticism, took this decision to change the entire political narrative which is anti-constitutional
 samvidhan main aarthik nahin balki aarthik, saamaajik, shaikshik rup se pichhadi jatiyon ke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he
 Devashish Jararia, who has been associated with the Bahujan Samaj Party and now joined the Congress, says that the Modi government has taken this decision without taking the opposition into confidence, which suggests that it has a flaw in its intentions
 loksabhaa chunaav najadik hai or sadan kaa satr kal khatm ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, no final decision can be taken on this decision of the government, because to make it legal, the constitution has to be amended and for this a meeting of the House is necessary

 Both the eligible girls or the Suhagin women are both

 In this puja, idols of shiva-parvati are duly worshiped and then the story of Hartalika Teej is heard
 mata parvati par suhaag kaa sara saamaan chadhaaya jaataa he
 It is believed that Lord Shiva himself protects the good fortune of the one who defeats all sins and worldly heat fasting

 Why the Hartalika Teej naam-hartalaika is made up of two words, green and table
 harith kaa arth heharankarna or talika arthataskhi
 This festival is celebrated on the Shukla Tritiya of Bhadrapada, due to which it is called Teej
 is vrath ko haritalika isliye kaha jaataa he, kyoki parvati kii sakhi (mitra) unhen pita ke ghar se haran karajngalmen le gai thi
 According to a legend in the hartalika Teej Vrat katha-linga Purana, mother Parvati, in her former birth, meditated in her childhood on the banks of the Ganges on the Himalayas to receive Lord Shankar as her husband
 is dauraan unhone ann kaa seven nahin kiya
 For many years he spent only by drinking air
 mata parvati kii yah sthiti dekhakar unke pita atyant dukhi the
 Meanwhile, one day Maharishi Narada approached Parvati's father on behalf of Lord Vishnu with the proposal of marriage of Parvati ji, which she accepted with pleasure
 pita ne jab maa parvati ko unke vivaah kii baat bataai to vah bahut dukhi ho gayi or jor-jor se vilaap karne lageen
 Then on the request of a Sakhi, Mata tells her that she is doing this harsh vow to get Lord Shiva as a husband, while her father wants to marry her to Vishnu
 tab saheli kii salaah par mata parvati ghaney van main chali gai or vahaan ek gupha main jaakar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana main leen ho gayi
 On the day of Bhadrapada Tritiya Shukla, Hath Nakshatra constructed the Shivalinga with the help of sand from the Matparavati and awakened the night by indulging in the praise of Bholenath
 tab mata ke is kathor tapasya se prasann hokar bhagwaan shiv ne unhen darshan die or icchaanusaar unako apni patni ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 It is believed that on this day, women who perform this fast lawfully and with full devotion, get a husband according to their mind

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi lied to the people in the matter of giving full state to Delhi
 is mudde par dilli ke log ab or anyaay bardaasht nahin karenge
 Arvind Kejriwal said that this is a false excuse that Delhi cannot be given full state status due to being the capital of the country
 ye bahaanaa nahin chalegaa kyonki dilli ke log puure endiemasi aria kaa control centre sarkaar ko dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 But the rest of Delhi, where there is an elected government, cannot be left under the central government
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar, dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ko gaiyr-nyyochit tareeke se hastkshep kiye bina kaam karne de or dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main adnga lagaana band kar de, isko lekar saare sambhav vikalp aajamaae gayi lekin usamen koi kamyaabi nahin mili
 So there is no way left for the full state to sit on an indefinite fast from March 1
 kejariwal ne kaha ki pichley chaar saal main modi sarkaar aadesh paarit karke dilli sarkaar kii shaktiyaan chhinti gai
 This deception of the Central Government with the people of Delhi is now in the people's court, which is the largest court of democracy

 We all did it
 inke saamne gidgidaae, dharna kiya
 Went to court jab koi rasta nahin bachaa to upwas kar rahe hai

 The Chief Minister said, "as the Home Minister of the country, Advani ji introduced the bill giving full statehood to Delhi in the Lok Sabha in August 2003
 diggaj congress netaa pranab da kii aguwai vaali home afares kii parliamentry cameti ne disambar 2003 main is bill kaa samarthan kiya tha
 But this bill was ultimately not allowed to proceed
 kya ye sirf dilli ke logon kii bhaawanaaon se khilne ke liye kiya gaya? dilli ke logon ke saath ye anyaay kyon?dilli, desh kii rajdhani he, isliye ise purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he, is tark ko khaarij karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, "haa, dilli, bharat kii rajdhani he
 Therefore, the center should keep the entire NDMC area under its control

 kai dal muslim vot ko khinchne main jute hai to 2014 ke aam chunaav par iskaa kya asar hoga?ab tak musalamaanon ne kamobesh gaiyr-bijepi dalon ko vot diya he
 In states like Uttar Pradesh, where more than one secular option exists, Muslims are said to have 'tactical voting' to defeat the BJP
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke prati musalamaanon kaa aakrosh bijepi ke prati naaraazgi se adhik kathor he
 The situation has become such that LK Advani is also being described as relatively secular even though he was the one who pushed the BJP towards Ayodhya
 alpsankhyak bijepi ko muslim virdohi party maanate hai
 More than 20 per cent of the decisive Muslim votes are in the 70 seats where Hindu votes can be converted in return, BJP will get a direct advantage in any election on communal basis
 puure bharat main kareeb 150 siton par musalamaanon kii vot hissedari 10 fisadi se adhik he
 Because of this number, they get the strength to decide who to vote for, but Hindu voters do not have the strength to mobilize in favor of BJP
 ye is tarah kii siten hai jahaan gaiyr-bijepi dal nirnaayak muslim vot paane ke liye apni-apni dharmanirpeksh chhavi dikhaanaa chahenge
 The margin of victory on these seats is less than 10 per cent
 dilachasp baat yah he ki ye siten un rajyon main zyada he jahaan bijepi kaa astitv nahin he
 In Kerala, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Assam, for instance, only regional parties give a direct fight to the Congress
 vahaan congress ko haraane ke liye unhen badi sankhya main muslim vot chahie
 That is why most regional parties in these states would like to oppose Modi and BJP
 isse ve congress ke mukaable khadey honge
 But this strategy does not work in states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat where the BJP is a strong contender and is desperate to move forward
 in rajyon main badi sankhya main aisi siten hai jahaan musalmaan acchhee-khaasi taadaad main hai
 In these states, the clear pro-muslim stance of Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Janata Dal (united) united Muslims towards these parties
 in siton par bijepi ke liye bhi hindu dhruvikaran kii gunjaaish ban jaati he
 The general belief is that whenever a party ties up with the BJP, the Muslim loses the vote
 yah kaaphi had tak sahi he par puri tarah sahi nahin he
 Nitish Kumar and Mayawati have proved that they can get Muslim votes even if BJP is a sidekick, although Narendra Modi's arrival has complicated matters
 muslim sanghathan loksabhaa ke sabhi 543 nirvachan kshetron main muslim matadaataaon ke liye vistrut disha-nirdesh taiyaar kar rahe hai
 It is difficult to say what will happen in the post-election environment, because the BJP may be untouchable for the Left parties, but usually every major regional party has tied up with it at some time
 muslim samudaay kaa vot kareeb 220 loksabhaa siton par saansad tay kar saktaa he
 These seats should not be matched with the seats where Muslim candidates win
 muslim saansad sirf 30 yani kul saansadon main kareeb 6 fisadi hai
 This proportion is quite low, given the 14 per cent share of Muslims in India's 120 crore population
 zyaadaatar hisaab-kitaab uttar pradesh main simat jaataa he
 In the 2007 assembly elections, when Bahujan Samaj Party was chosen among the Muslims, in 2012, the SP was joined, which led to one-party rule in the state
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone tarkeeb se kaam liya taaki sapa, bispi or congress ke behtareen ummivaar bijepi se jeet saken
 Briefly, the mandate of Uttar Pradesh seems to be fragmented in 2009, but look closely, the BJP lost only in the state, which won only 10 seats with 18 per cent votes, while the Congress seats increased from 9 to 21 and got the same number of votes
 
 iskaa arth yah hua ki uttar pradesh ne 80 main se 70 loksabhaa siton par gaiyr bijepi dalon ko chunaa
 Out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Muslims are more than 20 percent in about two dozen seats in the West
 inamen bareli, badaayun, pilibhit, rampur, sanbhal, amroha, meerut, mujffarnagar, saharanpur, bijanour or muradabad shaamil hai
 The Muslim vote is decisive in 12 more seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh, including Bahraich, Azamgarh, Gonda, Shravasti, Varanasi, Dumriaganj and Balrampur
 agar modi ne inamen se kisi seat, khaskar varanasi se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya to dhrurvikaran kaa asar na sirf pa
 Uttar Pradesh rather p
 bihar / bhojpur kshetra main bhi dikhaai degaa
 But after doing all this, Modi's development agenda will go in the background

 Search for 39 Indians who have been missing in Iraq for the last 3 years
 hindustan main jinke tadap rahe hai ki kahin se unki salaamati kii koi khabar mil jaae
 Many times the family requested the central government
 ab jabaki mosul par iraqi sena kaa kabja ho chukaa he
 Baghdadi's stronghold has been destroyed
 39 bharatiyon ke parivaar waalon ko ummid kii lau phir se jal uthi he
 The government is still giving the same assurance that the missing Indians will be safe
 ISIS se bachakar laute harjit ne kiya tha daawa- iraq main maare ja chuke hai 39 bhartiyainhin bharatiyon kii talash main ajtak iraq ke mosul pahunchaa or us jail kii talash kii, jahaan bharatiyon ke band hone kii khabar thi
 Aajtak ground report from Mosul, the stronghold of Baghdadi
 EXCLUSIVE: ajtak kii padtaal- iraq main laapata 39 bharatiyon kaa koi suraag naheembharatiyon ke gaayab hone par videshmantri kah rahi hai ki 2014 main irake ke mosul se gaayab hue 39 bhartiya badoosh kii jail main ho sakate hai
 The Minister of State for External Affairs is saying that the Ummadi holds the world
 bharat main iraq ke rajdoot fakhri al issa kah rahe hai ki sambhav he ki iraq ke mosul se laapata 39 bhartiya badoosh kii jail main hon
 That is, three big names of two countries are assuming that 39 Indians may have disappeared since 2014 in Mosul, the ruler of Baghdadi, the ruler of terror
 congress kaa EAM par hamalaa, kaha- iraq main gaayab 39 bharatiyon par sushamaa ne bolaa jhuthemosul se badoosh jane main pal pal jaan kaa khatra tha
 Anywhere Baghdadi feared to face the terrorists
 yahaan kii hawa main aatanki barood basii he
 So there was a constant fear of a blast
 magar ham dekhnaa chaahate the ki badoosh main wo jail kahaan he jahaan 2014 se gaayab bharatiyon ke rahane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 Aaj Tak's team also reached Badush, but showed us what
 
 
 usase ummid kii lau bujhati dikhaai dene lagi
 Hear from VK Singh, who returned from Mosul, INSIDE STORY, the prison of Badush, which is showing a ray of hope as a basis for the disappearance of 39 Indians, the prison itself has been set up by Baghdadi terrorists
 yahaan na banda dikhataa he na bande kii jaat
 Then the question is, where are the 39 Indians who disappeared from Mosul? Did they eat the land or swallow the sky? Aaj Tak's team reached Irbil after covering a distance of about 113 kilometers from Badush
 irbil iraqi kurdistan kii rajdhani thi or 3 saal tak bagdadi ne yahaan aatank kaa khulaa khel khelaa
 Aaj Tak directly reached the office of the Irbil Red Cross
 is ummid main ki hamen 39 laapata bharatiyon ke bare main shaayad koi suraag mil jaae
 Arriving here, we sought to know from the Red Cross officer whether he could give any information about the abducted Indians
 america raksha mantri kaa daawa- abhi bhi jinda he ISIS sargana bagdadired cross ke manager haavarey ishaan sadik ne kaha ki teen saalon tak mosul aies ke kabje main rahaa
 There is no information
 ajtak ne haavarey se poocha ki kya unke jivit hone kii sthiti main aapako jaankaree milegi, to unhone sahmati main haa kaha
 That is, no one has any idea about the officially abducted Indians
 EXCLUSIVE: ajtak kii padtaal- iraq main laapata 39 bharatiyon kaa koi suraag nahiirbil main 6000 se zyada bhartiya rahete hai lihaaza hamane sochaa kyon na bharatiyon se hi 39 bharatiyon kii jaankaree talaashi jaae
 For this purpose, Aaj Tak reached this hotel in Irbil
 yahaan tirupati naam kaa ek bhartiya shaks mila
 Tirupati told Aaj Tak that the people living here, as Indians, are sad but do not know where the 39 missing Indians are
 magar sawaal ye bhi he ki jab badoosh kii wo jail hi bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne barood se uda di to phir bharat sarkaar kis daawey se kah rahi he ki bhartiya badoosh kii jelon main band ho sakate hai

 The mps who made the charge in the Rajya Sabha said that the Adityanath Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh was snatching the livelihood of lakhs of people in the name of action against illegal slaughterhouses
 rajya sabha main shunya kaal ke dauraan hi maamla uthaate huetrinmul congress ke saansadandimul haq ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main haalat yah ho gai he ki avaidh boojadkhaanon ke khilaaf karrwai ke naam par maance bechney or ise taiyaar karne vaale logon ke aage roji-roti kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 Nadeemul Haque alleged that the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh government is taking action against the ravaged slaughterhouses has put a question mark on the basic right of the people to earn a living
 haq ne kaha ki koun aadmi kya kaam karata he or kya khaataa-peetaa he, yah tay karnaa rajya sarkaar kaa adhikaar nahin he
 He said that if the state government were to take action against the abattoirs, then a road map should be made so that the people engaged in this work can find other employment
 nadeem ul haq ne kaha ki insaanon kii baat to chhodie uttar pradesh ke chidyagharon main sher or baaghon ko bhi murge kha kar jinda rahanaa pad rahaa he

 Even though there are protests all over the country about GST, claims are being made that things will get expensive, entertainment of people will also get in trouble, but in contrast, a cinema hall in Varanasi has exempted tax from GST The new offering is made by giving the benefit of direct viewers
 cinema haul prabandhan ne tikaton ke daamon main kami kar di he
 Claims were being made that the implementation of GST would break the back of the film industry, but the cinema industry of Varanasi was happy with the government's decision
 khaskar bhojpuri cinema kii to balle balle ho gai he
 Because till now about 66 percent tax was charged as entertainment tax in Uttar Pradesh, which was too much for the low income audience
 isko kam karne ke liye samay-samay par maang bhi uthati rahi thi lekin kisi bhi sarkaar main ye tex kaam nahin hua
 Now this tax in GST has come down from 66 percent to 18 percent
 lagbhag ekatihaai se zyaada tex ke hat jane se cinema udyog se jude log badi raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 This relief has also been given to the 'anand Mandir' of Varanasi, a pioneer in Bhojpuri cinema
 lihaaja usne utana hi bada faisla liya he or ye puri raahat apane darshakon ko dene kaa elaan kar diya he

 Under the new rates, at present the tickets of Rs 70 will be reduced to Rs 50, Rs 60 tickets will be reduced to Rs 40 and Rs 50 to Rs 35
 cinema prabandhan kaa vishwaas he ki tikat dar main is kami se bhojpuri film ke darshakon ko badi raahat milegi or darshako kii sankhya badhegi jiskaa puraa laabh bhojpuri film udyog ko hoga

 People associated with the cinema industry are feeling great relief due to the withdrawal of tax by more than one third

 Therefore, he has taken an equally big decision and has announced to give this complete relief to his audience

 Kiran Kumar Reddy has stepped up the exercise to form a new party
 unhone is silsile main ravivaar ko baithak bhi kii
 Six mps and some of their closest ministers were removed from the Congress on the Telangana issue
 bhartiya salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ne ravivaar ko kaha ki dakshin africa ke khilaaf do test maichon kii shrinkhalaa ke liye rahul dravid kii anupasthiti team ke liye bada jhatka he lekin bangladesh ke khilaaf varsh ke shuru main do match jeetne se team aatmavishvaas se bhari he
 "rahul Dravid is a wall of the Indian middle order and his absence is a big setback against a strong team like South Africa," Gambhir, the brand ambassador of MRF, told reporters after the MRF Challenge Series Formula 1600 race was flagged off
 ‚Äô‚Äô unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòlekin hamane 2010 main acchhee shuruyaat kii he
 The players would like to maintain the winning momentum against South Africa
 iske alaava chot khel kaa hissaa hai or isse anya khilaadiyon ko majboot pratidwandvi ke khilaaf apana jajba dikhaane kaa mauka miltaa he
 Dravid suffered a jaw injury during the tour of Bangladesh and would miss the two-test series against South Africa starting February 6
 gambhir ne kaha ki del sten or morne morkal kii maujuudagi main dakshin africa kaa tej gendbaaji akraman majboot he lekin jahir khan or ishanth sharma kii bhartiya jodi bhi kam nahin he
 He said, "they have a strong pair in the form of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel
" hamen unhen dabaav main rakhane ke liye acchhee shuruyaat kerani hogi
 We may not have s Sreesanth but Zaheer is bowling very well

 If we bat first, we have to score big to help the bowlers and if we bowl first, we will have to get important wickets
 ‚Äô‚Äô unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdakshin africa team jab pichhali baar aayi thi to usne acha pradarshan kiya lekin shrinkhalaa nahin jeet paayi
 They will certainly be full of confidence but we have started the year well by winning the series against Bangladesh

 We will not have Mohammad Asif but there will be many other good foreign players and i believe our balance is very good
 ‚Äô‚Äô Dreaming of good and cheap treatment, chemists from the nearby states of Delhi often come to Delhi
 lekin dilli sarkaar ab aise logon par bandishen lagane ja rahi he
 Actually, people are now angry with two decrees of Delhi government
 ek taraf sarkaar ne dilli ke cancer hospital kii 80 fisadi siten dilli waalon ke liye rigerv kar di
 On the other hand, from September 10, GTB Hospital in Delhi will be discriminated against outside states
 baahar ke logon ko muft dawa or muft test kii suvidha par roak laga di jaaegi
 The government wants that Delhiites get better facilities in the hospital and people from outside states should come at least
 'india today' ke haath exclusive copy lagi he, jisamen 10 sitambar se nimnlikhit kaam karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 - Outside patients can be identified from a distance
 iske liye opidi card kaa rang badla jayega
 The OPD card of Delhi patients will be in white color while the OPD card of outside patients will be in blue color
 -opidi card banavaane ke liye dilli kaa voter card saath lekar aana hoga
 If you are a minor, you have to bring a ration card or marksheet
 -baahar ke marijon kaa ilaaj tabhi hoga, jab unke rajya kii aspataal ne dilli ke liye refer kiya hoga
 - No tests will be conducted except blood and urin test for the people of Bihar
 ultrasound, city scan eksre jaise test nahin kiye jaaenge
 - OPD medicine will not be given free of cost to patients outside Delhi
 itnaa hi nahin buudhvaar ko dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke cancer aspataal main ek aisi ghoshnaa kii, jise dilli ke baahar kaa koi bhi vyakti pasand nahin karegaa
 Kejriwal ordered to reserve 80% seats of beds of Cancer Hospital in Delhi for the people of Delhi
 jitibi hospital ke medical suparitendent kumaar kehete hai ki guru teg bahadur aspataal dilli ke border par he
 In such a situation, OPD card of 8 thousand patients is made here daily
 jabaki aspataal ke paas itane resorcej nahin he
 40% people come here for treatment outside Delhi
 aise main dilli waalon ko behatar ilaaj mili isliye ham ye skim laa rahe hai
 This hospital has approximately 15,00 beds
 vahiin aspataal main ilaaj karaane aae logon se baat kii to zyaadaatar logon ne isi skim kaa virodh kiya 
 Rakesh, who came from Baghpat to get treatment for his wife, says that Delhi is for everyone, why can not Kejriwal take such a step, there is no good hospital in Baghpat, so we come to Delhi for treatment
 vahiin gajiabad se aae harendra bataate hai ki dilli kii medical facility kaa istemaal to bahut pehle se kiya ja rahaa he
 Many governments have come, no one has stopped, then why now
 harendra beete 3 saal se apni maa kaa ilaaj yahaan kara rahe hai
 55-year-old Amina Begum, living in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, is deeply saddened by this order of Kejriwal
 ameena ko cancer he or unka ilaaj dilli ke cancer aspataal main beete do saalon se chal rahaa he
 She says that there is no good cancer hospital in and around Moradabad
 isliye majaburi main dilli main ilaaj kara rahi hai
 But now treatment will be difficult here too
 soshal activist auradilli hoicourtke adhivaktaa ashok agarwal kehete hai ki ye faisla samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 Governments cannot discriminate against anyone in the name of treatment
 ashok agarwal is maamle ko hoicourt main chalange karne kii bhi baat kah rahe hai
 Vahindilli BJP President Manoj Tiwari also appears against Kejriwal's decision
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki yah behad durbhagyapurna he ki ilaaj ke naam par bhedbhaav kiya ja rahaa he
 Kejriwal himself is outside Delhi
 upi or bihar ke logon ke saath bhedbhaav kiya ja rahaa he
 This shows that Arvind Kejriwal is mentally ill
 dilli main aag lagane kaa silsilaa jari he
 a fire broke out at Kidwai Bhawan on Janpath Road on Monday morning
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki aag chauthi manzil par lagi
 Eight vehicles of the fire department reached the spot and the fire was controlled after much effort
 philhal, kisi ke hataahat hone kii khabar nahin he
 Let us know that recently there was a fire in the main branch of SBI Bank located in Parliament Street, Delhi
 maukey par damakal vibhaag kii 7 gadiyon ne pahunchakar aag par kaabo paaya tha
 However, no damage was reported in this fire

 Earlier, Rahul Gandhi told Governor Satyapal Malik that he does not need a plane, but rather the freedom to go to Kashmir Valley and meet the people there

 He tweeted, "dear Governor Malik, a delegation of opposition leaders and i accept your invitation to visit Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh
