 Therefore, he has requested the Chief Minister to start selling it

 patr main mukhyamantri se aagrah kiya gaya he ki jagatiyal jile main bhi is bear kii bikri shuru karai jaae

 The elite anti-terrorism force ie NSG squad took part in the country's 68th Republic Day Parade at Rajpath for the first time
 parade ke dauraan sir se lekar nakh tak kaali poshaak pahane or empi five vishesh asalt rifl se las enesji ke 140 commandon ke daste ne rajpath par apni kshamta or dakshata kaa pradarshan kiya
 These commandos did not appear in the band's tune but on the Rajpath doing their style
 nakh se lekar sikh tak kaali poshaak main dhanke or puure sharir main kai kism ke raksha-kavchon se las enesji ke commandos kaa ek hi naaraa he- van for ol, ol for van
 Actually it is not an exaggerated slogan
 hakeekat yahi he ki enesji kaa ek commando aatankwaadiyon ke puure ek gang par baari padataa he
 When people saw this elite force on the Rajpath, they jumped with joy
 enesji ko apni sthapana ke baad se utkrishth kaaryo ke liye ab tak teen ashok chakra, teen kirti chakra, teen shaury chakra, 40 sena medal, 16 visisth seva medal or kai utkrishthata seva sammaan praapt ho chuke hai
 a team of NSG commandos marched on the Rajpath on a song written by noted lyricist Javed Akhtar in the parade
 enesji ke march past main hijank kii rokthaam ke liye vishesh rup se taiyaar kiye gaye vaahan or apharan rodhi abhiyaan main upyog kii jane vaali gadiyon kaa bhi is parade main pradarshan kiya gaya
 The specialty of the Black Cat commandos was the successful operation carried out by the NSG during the 26 / 11 attack
 @ pathankot hamale main bhi enesji ne safal oparation kiya tha
 @ Since its formation in 1986, to date NSG commandos have carried out more than two dozen dangerous operations
 koi yun hi aatank rodhi elite commando nahin ban jaataa, iske liye bahaate he pasinaa@ enesji kaa gathan 1986 main hua tha
 For this, paramilitary and army's best soldiers are chosen
 @ sabase pehle jin rangaruton kaa commandos ke liye chayan hota he, vah apni-apni senaaon ke sarvshereshth sainik hote hai
 Even then, they are selected through several stages
 ant main ye sainik training ke liye manesar pahunchate hai to yah desh ke sabase keemtee or jaanbaaj sainik hote hai
 @ 70 to 80 percent of the soldiers selected are trimmed
 @ commandos kii training bahut hi kathor hoti he
 The way to get selected in civil services is first preliminary examination
 phir mukhya parikshaw or baad main intervyuu
 More or less, the NSG Commandos Force also has to go through several phases
 @ jaruri nahin he ki training centre pahunchane ke baad bhi koi sainik antim rup se commando ban hi jaae
 @ Ninety days of rigorous training even before one week of such training
 jisamen 15-20 fisadi sainik antim daud tak pahunchane main rah jate hai
 Where is the selection of commandos, and what is the specialty
 NSG is formed by sorting out the specific jawans from different forces of the country
 jaankaree ke mutabik enesji main 53 pratishat commando sena se aate hai jabaki 47 pratishat commando chaar para mility forcej- siarpief, itibipi, rapid ection force or biguef se aate hai
 These commandos have a maximum service life of five years
 paanch saal bhi sirf 15 se 20 pratishat ko hi rakhaa jaataa he, shesh ko teen saal ke baad hi unki mul senaaon main waapas bhej diya jaataa he
 The biggest strength of NSG is its intensive training
 kisi saadhaaran sainik ko apni 20 saal kii samoochee sarvice main jitani training se nahin guzarana padataa he, usase kai guna zyada kisi esasji ke commando ko apni teen saal kii sarvice ke dauraan hi guzarana padataa he
 NSG also has two parts - one is (SAG) ie Special Action Group and the other is SRG i
e
 Special Rangers Group
 esaiji main multah bhartiya senaaon se chune gayi sainikon ko rakhaa jaataa he or esarji main bharat ke vibhinn ardgh sainya balon se chune gaye sainikon ko liya jaataa he
 There is a slight difference in the work of both
 haalanki donon ke liye training ek hi hoti he or mauka padane par donon ek-duusare ke vikalp ke taur par kaam karte hai
 But usually the SAG is sent on all those dangerous operations, in which an action has to be done on the spot
 is tarah kii karravaayiyon ke kendra main aamtaur par aatankwaadi vaaradaaten hoti hai
 This thinking of the government has given an opportunity to all the people and opposition parties to raise the question that in a state where millions of people are killed by diseases


 where millions of people are homeless and uneducated, such a large part of the Corporate Social Responsibility Fund is just idols, Is it permissible to spend on the development of temples and religious places or is it also part of any political agenda? dhanteras, karthik krishna trayodashi ko manaaya jaataa he
 It is believed that on this day, during the churning of the ocean, Dhanvantari appeared with the urn of nectar
 swasthya raksha or aarogy ke liye is dinadhanvantari dev kii upasnaki jaati he
 This day is also considered as the day of Kuber and Kuber is worshiped for wealth
 is din log moolyawaan dhaatuon kaa or nae bartanon va aabhushanon kaa kray karte hai or unhi bartanon tathaa murtiyon aadi se deepawali kii mukhya puja kii jaati he
 What to do and what special things to take care of on the day of Dhanteras
 
 
 sari safai ke kaarykram dhanteras ke purv nipta len,dhanteras ke din tak safijari na rakhen
 Do not worship Kubera only on this day, you must also worship Dhanvantari Deity
 agar is din dhaatuon kaa kray karnaa he to sona, pital or chaandi kharidni chahie
 Purchase ganesh-lakshmi statues and other worship materials for Deepawali on this day as well
 dhan teras ke din loha kharidne se bachanaa chahie
 What to buy on the day of Dhanteras 
 
 1
 Buying metal utensils is most beneficial
 agar pani kaa bartan ho to zyada acha hoga
 2
 ganesh lakshmi kii murtiyon, donon alag-alag honi chahie
 3
 khil bataashe or mitti ke deepak, ek bada deepak bhi jarur khariden
 4
 chahen to lakshmi or shri yantra bhi kharid sakate hai

 input language input- bhashaa Mumbai Police DIG Sunil Parskar has taken a new turn in the rape case
 model ke purv vakil ne krime branch ko bataaya he ki diaiji ke upar balaatkaar jaise sangeen aarope publicity ke liye lagaae gaye hai
 CCTV footage of the conversation between the model and her former lawyer is available with Aaj Tak
 model ke purv vakil rigwan siddiki somvaar ko krime branch kii mahila aparaadh shakha main apana bayaan record karaane pahunche the
 In this case, he had sent the first notice to Sunil Parskar
 lekin baad main peedit model ne rigwan siddiqui par bhi aarope lagaae ki wo parskar se mil gaye hai, isliye unka bayaan darj kiya gaya
 Siddiqui has handed over CCTV recordings of the victim's model meeting to them, audio recordings of conversations, chat and message details to the crime branch
 rigwan siddki kehete hai, 'main model ko dhai saal se jaanata hum
 He had to go to a big reality show, so he told me that he had to do the contravention so that publicity would come
 unhone mujhe kabhi nahin kaha ki unke saath rape hua he
 The conversation between the model and his former lawyer who complained against the DIG is as follows
 
 
 model- tum socho ki ham kisi ko kaise fansaa sakate hai
 How does it happen in a movie
 vaise vaala plan taiyaar karo
 Lawyer - You have to move, Naamodal - Yes
 tum dhundho
 Lawyer- i find according to my calculations, when it has been decided that Mohra Sunil Parskar has to be made, then planning was done for him
 model- mujhe uski bed publicity kerani he
 Lawyer - Leave it to me Model - i Really Vanna Heres Himvakil - Leave it to me Model - Not Harement
 uski bed publicity kerani he
 Don't bother him
 do teen din news main jane do
 That's all i want uski image kharaab kerani he or kuch nahin
 So was this all for publicity? Next, the whole thing is understandable
 vakil- dekho isamen kya banegaa
 It will have two or three things
 ek to wo badnaam ho jayega
 Okay
 
 We will put it indirectly through Poonam Pandey's work
 tumko punam pandeya ko atake karnaa he na inke thru
 Model- obviously
 
 Will it be through it? ab sawaal ye ki is maamle mempunam pandeya kii entry kyon hui?vajah he donon modells kii aapasi pratidwandita
 According to Rizwan Siddiqui, the accusing model had said that Poonam Pandey is her contender wherever she goes for work
 donon ke client saim hai use aisa lagata tha ki us riality sho main uski jagah kahin wo na chali jaae
 In one part of the conversation, Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria is also discussed
 matlab ye ki mashhoor hone ke liye police ke istemaal kii bhi taiyaari thi
 It is worth noting that nowhere in the alleged conversation with the former lawyer did the model mention rape or molestation

 tat par hum par tatasth nahinkunwar narayan kii bhentvartaayen; sampadakah vinod bharadwajrajakmal prakaashan,nai dilli-2,keemtah 250 ru
 Kunwar Narayan is undeniably a rare presence in the Hindi poetry scene
 patibaddhtaon or rajnatik rup se sahi hone ke atirikt dabaavon ke daur main ve bina kisi shorgul or atmprachaar ke apana kaam karte rahete hai
 His thoughts about poetry, society, life, death, politics, philosophy, etc
 are so settled that while talking on any subject, he does not have any kind of confusion and there is no dilemma or fear of two meanings in his language
 lives
 america ke iova vishvavidhyalay kii ore se yojit kii jane vaali kavy kaaryshaala main hindi ke kai vam or ati vampanthi kavi ho aae
 When Kunwarji got a proposal to go there, he had to give it in writing that he is not a leftist
 kunwar ji vaaki vampanthi nahin he, iske baavjood unhone likhakar nahin diya ki ve vampanthi nahin hai or iova janaa asweekaar kar diya
 Asking a creator for his ideology and choosing the ideology more than the creation on the basis of it, was not acceptable to a sensitive poet-mind like Kunwar ji
 isliye unki hi pankti ko udhaar lekar kaha jaae to yah sach haih tat par hum tatasth nahin
 a compilation of interviews by Kunwar Narayan has been published in the editing of poet and art critic Vinod Bhardwaj: 'coast on Hoon but not neutral
 ' is sankalan main ikkis saakshaatkaarkartaaon dwaara unase vibhinn kalkhandon or vibhinn avasaron par liye gaye saakshatkaaron ko sankalit kiya gaya he
 If the questioner who is going to interview Kunwar ji does not have any preparation, if the question is not told to him in advance, then he is usually not ready for interview
 saakshaatkaar lene vaale vyakti ke yah thodaa jaruri bhi he kyonki puraani dilli main nnagalib samaaroh main mushaayare ke baad ek bade hindi samachar channel kii mahila patrkaar ne nida fazli se yah sawaal kiya tha ki filmi geeton ke alaava bhi aap kuch likhte hai? aap urdu ke shaayar hai to kya aapako hindi-angreji aati he? jaahir he, nida sahab ke bhadakne ke liye yah kaaphi tha
 The bottom line is that interviewing a big personality is not an easy task
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main kunwar ji kavita ko lekar kehete hai: ''kavita jivan se behad pyaar kii bhashaa he
 Respect this heartlessness and this love, poetry becomes the language of sadness created by their absence
 lekin phir bhi yah ehsaas bana rahata he ki manushya ke paas ek athaah vaibhav he
 i wanted to be a poet again and again to remind myself of that two and a half days
 yah sirf bhavukta kii nahin, ek bahut badi budhimatta kii baat bhi he
 Apart from literature, Kunwar ji is a serious fan of film and Hindustani classical music
 sangeet ko lekar unki tippanee haih ''ucch koti kaa sangeet hamaare man ko roj ke dabaavon se mukt karke apane liye ek 'jagah' banaata he
 This 'place' does not become empty even after an immediate performance, settling its memories
 ham unhen bahut baad tak apane andar sun sakate hai
 This specialty is not limited to music, a permanent feature of all great arts
 ''in dinon kaviyon main atmamugdhata kaa sankraman jis teji se ho rahaa he, vah bahut bhayanak he
 Look at an interesting question asked by Kunwar ji of a great (?) Youth and see his very well-sorted, gracious, but blunt answer to that question: Is it important for a great writer to be self-assured? "no, not at all
" balki atmamukt hona jaruri he
 For good writing, it is necessary that a writer should also be associated with his society at large
 tabhi nijee kaa saadhaaraneekaran or vistaar ho paata he
 "by reading this book of interviews of Kunwar Narayan it becomes very clear why he is a great poet

 abhi tak bahut se purv saansadon ne makaan khaali nahin kiye or nae saansadon kaa dabaav he ki jaldi se jaldi unako makaan alot kiye jaaen
 Several months have passed since the Lok Sabha elections held this year

 Now the new mps have to be allotted after these government houses are vacated
 lekin alot karne se pehle makaanon ko rinovet bhi karwaanaa padataa he or is prakriya main bhi samay lagata he
 This is the reason why even after allotting houses to some mps, he has not been able to shift to his bungalows

 If ACP Crime is believed by Shamsher Singh, no such business will be allowed to run in Cyber city
 gurugram police samay-samay par aise kai spa centre or guest house main chal rahi veshyavriti ko ujagar kar chuki he
 Many people have also been arrested in this case
 bataa den ki gurugram police ne beete 11 maheenon main takreeban 100 se zyada logon ko jail kii salaakhon ke peeche bhejne kaa kaam kiya he
 All these people were involved in prostitution work

 kehane ko to paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main vibhinn partiyon main kadaa muqabla he lekin in dinon jo naam sabase adhik charchaa main he, vah he bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa
 Modi has been fully electoral by addressing rallies across the country after winning a long battle within the party two months ago to announce his name for the post of Prime Minister
 modi ke bhaashanon se pataa chalata he ki un vibhinn matadaata virgon main santulan saadhane ke liye unhen kitni jaddojahad kerani pad rahi he jinhen ve khush rakhana chaahate hai
 When they talk of development without appeasement, there is a message hidden in it for such a development-starved middle class who is ready to ignore Modi who divides society for the sake of modern Modi, because he expects him to stagger Will trigger doosraa sandesh kattarpanthi hindutv brigade ke liye he
 In his rally in Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh on November 8, Narendra Modi challenged, "CBI and Indian Mujahideen (IM) will fight to save Congress in next election"
 janata ke bich aakar hamaara muqabla kiijie
 Do not attack our backs by hiding like cowards
 ”shaayad aisa pehali baar hua he ki pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ne kisi pramukh rajnatik party yaa sibiai kii tulana aatanki sanghathan se kii ho
 In the rally, he also talked about achieving the goal of providing 24-hour power to the villages of Gujarat, but only his IM comment will be remembered for a long time
 bijepi ke ek ranneetikaar kaa kahana he ki modi chaahe apane shabd chun-chunakar bolte hon yaa unki jubaan phisal jaati ho, ''sandesh vahaan pahunch jaataa he jahaan use pahunchnaa chahie tha
 "for example, the fact that the entire BJP calls Rahul Gandhi the crown prince of the Congress, but for Modi he has always been the 'prince of the Delhi Sultanate'
 modi ke mutabik congress sirf kapade hi nahin pahenti balki muslim voton ko rijhaane ke liye vah 'dharmanirpekshata kaa burka bhi odhati he
 Modi is trying to woo Hindutva voters with symbols like Shahzada and Burka, while he is threatening the development of Gujarat for the urban middle class
 kaaryakartaaon or ati-utsaahi logon ke liye modi kaa sandesh hindu netaa kaa yaa ek bijepi netaa ke shabdon main kahen to 'hindu hriday samraat’ kaa hota he
 It is therefore no surprise that Modi and other BJP leaders continued the rally despite the many blasts that took place in Patna on October 27
 usamen saat logon ko apni jaan ganvaani padi or kai anya ghayal ho gaye
 Modi may have endangered himself and others but it was in keeping with the masculine and Bahubali image which he has been vigilantly carving for many years
 soshal media unki tulana ek sher se karte massej tathaa chhaviyon se bharaa padaa he
 a crowd chanting slogans at rallies and even BJP meetings welcomes him with the slogan ‘bharat Maa ka Sher Sher Aaya’
 jab bihar bijepi ne patna main maare gaye logon ke asthi kalshon ke saath ek yatra nikaalnaa tay kiya to modi ko hindutv kii jarurat or apni us nai naram chhavi ke bich santulan saadhane kii sabase kadi pariksha se guzarana padaa jiske nirmaan kii koshish ve apane 'nyaay sabhi kaa, tushtikaran kisi kaa nahin’ or 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas’ jaise judawaan naare ke madhyam se kar rahe hai
 Modi realizes that because of pressure from activists, the RSS has softened on the issue of his candidature for the post of Prime Minister, while if the elections are to be fought on issues like inflation, corruption and development, then he is just a few from the Hindu heart emperor Will need to be more
 bijepi ke liye sabase adarsh sthiti main party ko ek hindutv samarthak dhruvikaran kii ummid he jo 2014 main use bahumat dilaa le jayega
 Sudhanshu Trivedi, political advisor to BJP President Rajnath Singh, says, "if this election was a wave, that wave would arise due to polarization of Hindu nationalist votes
" ateet main sabhi lehren aise hi dhruvikaran kii vajah se paidaa hui hai
 "the electoral arithmetic of the BJP is based on the belief that after the Bangladesh war and from the 1984 Congress victory to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement that brought the BJP to power in Delhi, all the big waves have come on the shoulder of polarization of Hindu votes
 
 lekin modi ek hi daanv par puri tarah nirbhar nahin rahanaa chaahate
 When the Bihar BJP unit proposed the Bhatti Kalash Yatra, Modi suggested that he address a condolence meeting in Patna for those killed in the rally
 magar bijepi alaakaman ne pradesh ikai kii maang ko sweekaar kar liya
 The supporters of the yatra argued that people were killed because they had come to attend the BJP rally, so something special should be done for them
 modi santvanaa dene ke liye mritkon ke ghar jaakar unke parijanon se mili
 Modi has been trying to keep his Hindutva image a little restrained these days
 uttar pradesh main unhone do jagah reliyaan kin, baharich or kanpur (19 aktubar) main, lekin unhone kahin bhi ram mandir kaa naam tak nahin liya
 The job has been left to his trusted lieutenant and BJP general secretary Amit Shah, who began his tenure as the party's Uttar Pradesh in-charge in July with a visit to Ayodhya
 narendra modi in dinon apehnakrit naram hindutv drushtikon ko tarjeeh dete hai
 They would prefer to emphasize only on the image of Vikas Purush devoid of any urge of appeasement
 aresas netaa or gujarat bijepi ke mahasachiv bharat pandya modi ke man ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate hai
 He says, "the entire Sangh Parivar is united with him on Narendra Modi's vision of development, poverty alleviation and national pride because the RSS is also against minority appeasement and not minorities
" ”isliye patna raily main modi ke yah kehane par ki garib hinduon or musalamaanon ko aapas main ladgaye kii bajaae garibi se laduya chahie, jab sangh kii ore se koi nakaaratmak pratikriya nahin ai to kisi ko aashcharya nahin hua
 References to Maharana Pratap, Shivaji and Chanakya come up repeatedly in Modi's speeches while speaking on 'true hindu-muslim unity'
 yah baat kattarpanthi tatwon ko khush rakhti he
 In talking to Deobandi Muslim leaders, Modi never went to the extent of wooing him
 modi kaa makasad sirf itnaa he ki musalmaan unke khilaaf aakraamak hokar ekamusth matdaan na karen
 Modi's Muslim candidates have been telling the Deobandi leaders that they will also ensure the Muslims' share in the cake of development, but it will be without any special consideration
 sitambar, 2011 main ahmedabad ke apane teen din chalane vaale sadbhaavna upwas se kuch din pehle modi ne blog main likhaa tha, ''(justise sachhar cameti kii) report ke vishleshan se gujarat ke musalamaanon ne jis tarah kii tarakkee he uskaa saaf pataa chal jaataa he
 Especially compared to their siblings from other states
 ” sangh ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''jab tak modi muslim voton ke liye rashtriya gaurav ke muddon ko tilanjali nahin dete hai tab tak hamen koi dikkat nahin he
 "but the interesting thing is that those who are a challenge for Modi to win are people outside the RSS

 " kya hoga abasaramkaa? kitne dinon tak jail main hi rah sakate hai asaram? jodhpur police kyon asaram ke purv sevadaaron ko gavaah bana rahi he? jodhpur police 6 november ko jodhpur kii adaalat main iskaa khulaasa karne ja rahi he
 According to the government lawyer, the sections of conspiracy and rape can be imposed on Asaram from the sections of jismaphoris
 6 november ko asaram ke saare karnaamon kaa kaccha-chittha chargeshit main court main rakhaa jayega
 The list of sections in the chargesheet to be presented against Asaram in the Jodhpur court is quite long
 dhara 120, dhara 342, dhara 354, dhara 376, dhara 375, dhara 506, dhara 509- ye sabhi dharaaen shahjahanpur kii naaballig ladki ke dushkarm ke aarope ke maamle main lagi hai
 But the Jodhpur police is also preparing to get Asaram life imprisonment
 yahi vajah he ki nai dhara chargeshit main jodi ja rahi he, dhara 370
 It deals with deception, fear, deception, pressure, misuse of power or greed or abduction and abduction of minor girls in the ashram
 saath hi asaram ke purv sevadaaron ke bayanon ke aadhaar par jismfaroshi kii dhara bhi jodi ja rahi he, jisamen naaballig ladakiyon or mahilaon ko jismfaroshi ke daldal main dhakelnaa, dusron ke saamne pesh karnaa he yaa phir aisi jagah ko sanchalit karnaa, jisamen ye sab hota he
 To prove this allegation, the Jodhpur Police has made the basis of the statements made by former servicemen of Asaram in front of the police
 in purv sevadaaron mahendra chawla, rahul or rakesh ko is maamle main court main gavaahi ke liye bhi bulaayaa jayega
 These people have said in their statement to the Jodhpur police that Asaram and his son Narayan Sai used to physically exploit women and girls and keep them in their possession unfairly
 inke khilaaf munh kholane vaale ko sajaa di jaati thi, isiilie chargeshit main dhara 370 jodi ja rahi he
 Asaram has been charged in connection with the conspiracy to summon the minor to a hut in association with his servant Siva, Warden Shilpi, Gurukul Director Sharatchand in connection with the rape of a minor
 asaram par iske baad dhara 342 lagaai gai, jisamen naaballik peedita ko apni kutiyaa main bandhak banane kaa aarope he
 Also Section 354 is imposed, which is alleged to have molested the victim
 dhara 506 isliye lagaai gai he, kyonki asaram ne peedita ko munh kholane par puure parivaar samet jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di thi
 Asaram is charged with subsection 34 of 509, in which Asaram is accused of speaking mild and lewd things about women
 asaram par sabase gambhir aarope ban rahe hai dhara 376, dhara 375 or pokso (POCSO) act kii dhara 5 ke section 6 ke tahat
 While section 376 has accused Asaram of rape, Asaram has been charged with rape under section 375
 sansad main nae act pokso ke tahat asaram par maamla isliye darj hua he, kyonki yah section shaikshanik yaa dharmik sanstha ke prabandhan yaa karmchaaree ke rup main kiya gaya he
 If Asaram is convicted under these sections, it can range from seven years to life imprisonment

 uttarakhand rajya main do siyaasi dal congress or bhaajapa ke bich chunavi jang simati he
 Due to the main contest between the two political parties, now the electoral campaign in the state of star campaigners is catching up fast
 pichley chunaavon main is rajya kii paanchon loksabhaa siton main bhaajapa ne jeet hasil kii thi
 For this reason, this time the BJP is under pressure to repeat the 2014 Vijayagatha, while the Congress, divided in camps, has to prove itself in the five Lok Sabha seats
 aagaamee 11 april ko pratham charan main hi yahaan kii paanchon siton par matdaan hoga
 But looking at the electoral issues in the state, the ruling party, which is trying to divert attention from the local issues, seems to be successful in turning the direction of nationalism and elections on indo-pak
 ab tak congress ke star prachaarak rahul gandhi dehradun main or pradhanmantri narendra modi rudrapur main chunavi raily kar chuke hai
 For the BJP, Rajnath Singh has also held public meetings in various constituencies of Pauri and Almora Lok Sabha
 rajya ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat to saarvajanik taur par apane netaaon ko salaah de rahe hai ki ve saansadon se kaam poochne hi na den, keval pulavama hamale or sena kaa parakram bataakar logon ke bich jaaen
 Despite the plethora of local issues in the entire state, these local issues are seen flowing in the sea of national issues laid by the ruling party
 log apni pareshaaniyon or sthaneey samasyaon ke viruddh ki ja rahe chunaav bahishkaar ke elaan samet dharne pradarshan ke baavjood rajnatik dalon kaa focus in muddon par nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The state government is also trying to ensure that the performance of the government, whether the government is at the center or not, becomes an election issue of the state
 alag alag siton main alag alag mudde sthaneey str par mahatvapurn hai
 Despite the security of Ballia Nala in Nainital being essential for the survival of Nainital, the vote of the state government does not appear to be hurt
 shahar kii maal road kii durdasha ke baavjood us par sarkaar kii chuppi haldwani or usase jude bhabar ke peyajal or sinchai ke liye jamarani baandh, jo ki pichley 25 saal se ab tak banane kaa naam nahin le rahaa, ko bhi chunavi mudda banane main lage log naakaamayaab dikh rahi he
 Demonstrations are being held in Almora Lok Sabha on issues like road electric water hospital in rural areas of Bageshwar Pithoragarh Champawat district
 tehri loksabhaa main dobra chanthi pul karodon kharchane ke baavjood na ban paane se log trast hai
 Due to lack of bridge, more than one and a half lakh population of Pratapnagar area is facing problems
 nai tehri se pratapnagar jane ke liye teen se chaar ghante kaa safar tay karnaa padataa he
 If the bridge was built, Pratapnagar could be reached from New Tehri for one to one and a half hours
 tehri loksabhaa ke dhanolti vidhansabha sthit chhijula pattee ke 9 gaanv ke janpratinidhiyon ne dibhogi gaanv main mahapanchayat yojit kar sadak nahin to vot nahin ko lekar charchaa kii
 The local administration also reached the spot to convince the villagers, but no concrete result was found
 jonpur ke gaanvon ke janpratinidhiyon ne mahapanchayat yojit kar sadak nahin to vot nahin kaa nirnay liya he
 In a meeting with the local administration, the villagers said that by April 8, the administration will boycott the Lok Sabha elections if the administration does not take any concrete decision regarding the construction of the road
 13 saal main dhai arab rupee kharchane ke baad bhi dobra chanthi pul nahi bana 
 Every morning when the villagers of Pratapnagar block of Tehri district see the unfinished dobra-chanthi bridge in front of them, memories of their glorious history are floated in their eyes
 sthaneey gramin arjuna singh ke anusaar, jhil banane se pehle hamaare khet sona ugalate the, lekin jhil ne sab leel liya
 The government promised us that if the bridge is built, there will be prosperity in the area, but even after 13 years, the bridge is not built
 aaj gaanv main sadak he lekin pul nahin bana paae
 Rural Bharat Singh Rawat says that the development of Pratapnagar has also been stopped due to non-construction of a bridge
 pul na hone se biimaar logon ko samay par upachaar nahin miltaa
 The work of this bridge started in the year 2006
 varsh 2010 main digaayan sahi na hone ke kaaran kaam band ho gaya
 By then, one billion 50 crores had been spent on the bridge construction
 uske baad varsh 2015 main dobaaraa pul kaa nirmaan dedh arab kii laagat se shuru kiya gaya
 In August last year, the bridge work stopped again due to suspension breakdown of Dobra bridge
 aazaadee ke baad bhi sadak nahin pahunchane se naaraaz nainital jile ke raitkhan ke graminon ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kaa bahishkaar karne kaa ultimatum diya he
 Raitkhan villagers, 22 km from Nainital district headquarters, demand that Raitkhan, Tok Kodal, Samdhar, Thandev be connected by road
 graminon ne aakrosh vyakt karte hue kaha ki har chunaav main sadak dene kaa vaada jarur kiya jaataa he, magar chunaav ke baad koi bhi netaa gaanv nahin aata he
 So this time they will not vote for any party
 almoda loksabhaa ke bageshwar jile ke 1 darjan se adhik gaanvon ne apni kai samasyaon ko lekar chunaav bahishkaar kii chetavanee di ja rahi he
 Despite this, representatives of any political party are not reaching to convince these voters
 iske vipareet netaa apane kaamon ko ginane main lage hue hai
 The Election Commission and the team of SVEEP are constantly working from village to village to motivate voters for cent percent voting
 janpratinidhiyon kii udaseenta se jahaan janata pareshaan he, vahiin vikaas kaary bhi nahin ho rahe hai
 Demolition of political parties from villages in this manner is a threat to democracy
 graminon kaa maananaa he ki janpratinidhi keval vot maangane ke liye hi gaanv aate hai
 Despite this, no political party cares about local issues or local problems
 tehri loksabhaa kshetra main pahaad kii sabase badi samasya barojgari he
 Due to unemployment, the migration from the mountains is increasing continuously
 gaanv ke gaanv khaali hote ja rahe hai
 But the candidates who are contesting the elections do not pay any attention to it
 ve raashtra str ke muddon kii baaten kar matadaataaon kaa dhyaan bhatakaane main lage hue hai
 At the same time, local people believe that till the problems of unemployment are not resolved in the mountain, the migration will not stop

 a very interesting thing happened yesterday that it is said about the media that we will investigate on you, because Rafael's files have disappeared, but he has scammed 30 thousand crores rupees, which is clearly written in the files, There will be no investigation on that

 The basic idea is to defend Narendra Modi by manipulating anything
 chaukeedaar ko bachaakar rakhana he
 He also said that the government is saying that if Rafael's papers were stolen, it means that those papers are correct

 Investigate every person in the Rafale deal, including against the Prime Minister

 lekin takadir kaa sitam dekhie ki whats ap se apane aashiq ko bheji gai inhen panktiyon ke baad usne is duniya ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye alavida kah diya or khudakushi kar lee
 This is a painful story of failure in Ishq of a woman constable of Rajasthan Police who, if she got anything in her life instead of love, was just infidelity
 pehle pati se anban
 Then first to Rusik and then infidelity to the second lover
 aakhirkaar kahani maut par jaakar khatm hui
 Shobha, a lady constable posted at the Mandore police station in Jodhpur, had a dream
 wo padhi likhi to thi hi, kariyar vuman bhi bananaa chaahati thi
 But in the meantime he got married and by marriage he also had a son
 lekin jindagi phir bhi patari par nahin aa saki
 Soon, there was a rift in the husband-wife relationship and Shobha had to separate
 iske baad use police main naukari to mil gai, lekin jeevanasathi kii kami hameshaa salti rahi
 He got his life as another constable named Mukut Meena
 mukut ke saath kai saalon tak uske rishte rahe
 But when it came to the wedding, Mukut refused to pursue the relationship, saying she was married
 ye shobhaa kii jindagi main kisi ajaab se kam nahin tha
 But he still managed himself
 ab jindagi kii gaadi jaise-taise phir se aage badhane lagi
 But this time another police constable named Mahavir holds his hand with the promise of removing the lack of love in life
 takreeban saal bhar tak donon saath-saath vakd gujaarte rahe
 Keep eating vows of living and dying
 lekin jab is pyaar ko naam dene kaa vakt aayaa, to dusron kii tarah mahavir bhi peeche hat gaya
 Moreover, Mahavir switched off his mobile phone to get rid of the same Shobha that Mahavir would talk with for hours
 lekin itane se jaise is kahani kaa ant nahin hota tha
 So after this Mahavir's brother allegedly started threatening Shobha to stay away from his brother
 bas isi ke baad shobhaa ne jo faisla kiya, uske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 On Wednesday, Shobha tried to kill herself by eating poisonous things in her room
 vakt rahete padosiyon ko shobhaa ke is harakat kii khabar bhi mil gai or use aspataal bhi pahunchaaya gaya
 But the doctors failed to save her life
 tab usee police ne shobhaa kii maut ke maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii, kabhi wo jiskaa hissaa hua karti thi
 The police got a suicide note from his house and in this suicide note, he got the whole story, which went on Shobha's life
 philhal, police shobhaa kii khudakushi ke baad mili is suicide note kii binah par jahaan uski maut ke jimmedaar pulisavaalon par karrwai kii taiyaari main he, lekin muhabbat main mili rusavaai kii ye kahani ab har kisi ko kachot rahi he
 The police have registered a case against eight people, including her husband and two policemen, for the suicide of a lady constable by deception in the name of love
 lekin ye rajasthan kii iklauti kahani nahin he
 The shocking thing is that there are so many lady constables in police stations like her, with whom their seniors themselves are torturing and exploiting them
 aaropon kii ganga bah rahi he jis daur main, usamen ek aarope kii bayaar aam aadmi party ke purv vidhayak rajesh garg ne arvind kejariwal ek aarope lagaakar chhod di he
 He says that in December 2013, Kejriwal used to make fake calls to buy mlas in the name of BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Nitin Gadkari
 rajesh garg ke mutabik jab disambar 2013 main sarkaar banane ke liye jab aam aadmi party raishumaari kara rahi thi us samay unako or baaki duusare bahut se vidhayakon ko der raat or subah ke vakt privet number se phone aa rahe the, jisamen bolaa jaataa tha ki wo nitin gadakari or arun jetali ke offis se bol rahe hai or aapako 10 karod rupee die jaaenge, agar aap bijepi ko samarthan kar den to
 According to Garg, he got a call from Arun Jaitley on which he had lodged a complaint with the police
 lekin janvari 2014 main jab phone karne vaala pakadaa gaya to arvind kejariwal ke pie or baad main netaa sanjay singh kaa phone aayaa, jisamen unhone kaha ki apana aadmi funs gaya he, usko chhudwaao
 According to Garg, Sanjay Singh in his conversation admitted that he was making fake calls
 yani arvind kejariwal kii sahmati se hi unako or baaki vidhayakon ko jetali or gadakari ke naam se phone gaye
 This matter is important because Arun Jaitley's name was raised in December 2013 by AAP leaders in connection with the purchase and sale of mlas
 yani agar aarope sahi hai to kejariwal ke kiye se jetali bematlab badnaam ho gaye ye maamla dikhataa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is already avoiding speaking anything on media cameras nowadays, so if anyone keeps making sense of anything, the party does not seem worried
 lekin isse kya hota he
 
 
 The news will still go on like the news and will go on seeing all the aspects
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane vaali baat he ki pichhali baar jahaan rajesh garg audiyon recording kar laae the jisamen kejariwal, congress vidhayakon ko todane kii baat kar rahe the
 This time he does not have any proof to prove that what Rajesh Garg is saying is correct
 rajesh garg pehle hi party virdohi gatividhiyon ke liye party se nikaale ja chuke hai
 In such a situation, how much attention should be paid to his allegations? agar janvari 2014 main hi garg ko pataa chal gaya tha ki kejariwal kii sahmati par hi ye sab farji phone or kharid-farokht kaa silsilaa chal rahaa tha to garg march 2015 main kyon bina subut ke kejariwal par aarope laga rahe hai? aaj aisa kya ho gaya? However, there is no denying the possibility that maybe Kejriwal and his party have adopted such a method to weigh the sincerity of their mlas and see who can break the MLA which political intelligence Can also be part of
 lekin ye sabit kaise hoga? garg aarope laga rahe hai or ho saktaa he party jab bole to aarope ko nakaar de
 The truth will be known only when either the party accepts the charge or the evidence comes out
 varna to roj jis tarah reporter story karke duusare din duusari story par lag hi jaataa he
 This thing also has come and gone
 dhara to aaropon kii bah hi rahi he

 isse afghanistan ke saath dwipaksheeya vyapaar ko badhaane main madad milegi, kyonki pakistan bhartiya maal ko sadak maarg se afghanistan le jane kii anumati nahin detaa he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle said on Friday, 'the freight corridor between India and Afghanistan is now on the verge of becoming a reality

 The aim of the air cargo service is to give Afghanistan an alternative trade link in the Indian market and to transport Indian cargo to this war-ravaged country
 afghanistan ke fal, mewan or kaaleen kii bharat main kaaphi maang he or maal dhulaai galiyare se inke aayaat ko badhaava milegaa

 Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand's dream of retaining his title was shattered, while Norway's Magnus Carlson became the new chess emperor by drawing a tenth game at the World Championships
 carlson, jo ki 30 november ko apana 23waan janmdin manaayenge, ne do baziyaan shesh rahete hi khitaab apane naam kiya
 He won three of the ten games, while the remaining seven were drawn
 is tarah se carlson 6
 He became the world champion only after finishing tenth by scoring 5 points
 yah shatranj kii duniya main nae yug kii shuruyaat he
 Karlsson needed only a draw for the title, but instead of playing a dull game, he challenged Anand completely, making the tenth stakes very tough
 alam yah rahaa ki norway ke khilaadi ne anand ko chaar ghante or 45 minute tak jujhane ke liye majaboor kiya
 It was the most unilateral match in the history of the World Championships, after which Ananda must surely have breathed a sigh of relief
 anand ne paanch baar 2000, 2007, 2008, 2010 or 2012 main khitaab jeeta tha, lekin vidmbana dekhie ki unhen apane gharelu shahar chennai main apana taj ganvaana padaa
 Not only this, this is the first time, while Anand failed to win a single game in the World Championship match
 anand ne 1991 se lekar pichley 22 varshon main prayek mukaable main ek baaji jaruri jiti thi
 Carlson did the trick from the beginning of the tenth game
 unhone waisi hi shuruyaat kii jaisi vah chaahate the or apane pratidwandvi ko gherne ke liye sahi tarah se aage bade
 Anand, however, did not give up this time and eventually drew Baji with his superb defense
 jaisi ki ummid thi anand ne sicilian difens apanaaya
 He faced the Moscow Variations, which Carlson had tried before
 donon khiladiyon ne shuru main routine chaalen chali or carlson ne teesri chaal main check diya
 Carlson, who was playing with white pieces, was in a slightly advantageous position when two small pieces were finally taken off the board, but he did not attempt a draw
 vah 21veen chaal thi jiske baad adhiktar shatranj visheshgyon kaa maananaa tha ki donon khiladiyon ko apni chaalon ko dohraane main khushi hogi
 Carlson was close to the title and there was not much hope for Anand
 haalanki norway kaa khilaadi chaal dohraane se pehle hataa
 Anand then breathed some relief after the swapping of two small pieces, but the pressure was on him then
 carlson ne 28veen chaal main raja ke saamne ke pyaade ko paanchaven khaane main aage badhaakar samaapti kii taraf kadam badaye
 Anand made a comeback after a few moves and eventually went on to finish the betting horse and some pawns
 anand ke liye sthiti adhik jatil karte hue carlson ne apana raja aage badhaakar apni majboot sthiti barkaraar rakhi
 Anand had to put his horse and the king in defense so that there was no further damage
 donon khilaadi lagbhag teen ghante main pehle time control par pahunche, jabaki 40 baziyaan puri hui, lekin tab tak saaf ho gaya tha ki yaa to carlson jeet darj karegaa yaa phir baaji drow hogi
 In both cases, Anand's campaign was to end and for the five-time world champion, it was a very unpleasant task
 khel aage badhane ke saath anand kuch baichen bhi lag rahe the, lekin ek samay carlson ko dekhakar lag rahaa tha ki jaise ki vah koi khoonkhaar jaanavar hon
 He looked comfortable, but wanted to eat every victim that came in his way
 khel main 46veen chaal main naatakeey mode aayaa, jab carlson ne badi der tak vichaar karne ke baad chaal chali
 It seemed that the Norwegian player wanted to sacrifice some of his pieces and he did so after two moves
 iske kaaran anand apane sabhi pyaade ganvaa baithe or board par nai raniyaan aa gayi
 Anand had an extra horse, but Carlson had a queen and two dangerous-looking pawns
 anand ne aise main sahi chaal par dhyaan diya or carlson ko drow ke liye majaboor kiya
 This bet lasted 65 moves
 carlson ko khitaab ke alaava puraskaar raashi kaa 60 pratishat hissaa mila, jo ki lagbhag 14 karod rupee banataa he

 On October 10, the Securities Appellate Tribunal in a stringent order passed two of Roy's companies, Sahara Commodity Services Corporation Ltd

 unhone panchat ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti dene kaa faisla kiya he, lekin rigerv bank ke aadesh vaali rakam waapas karne ke liye ve vachanabaddh hai
 The arbitration order came in November 2010 following a decision by SEBI, the financial market regulator, which accused two Sahara group companies of raising money from people through OFCDS

 In its note, the Reserve Bank directed that Sahara Kaval can invest only in government securities and fully secured PSU bank deposit schemes

 Why did the government have to take such a step? When asked by India Today, the Reserve Bank declined to comment, but did say that it was investigating sifcl's advertisement

 Sahara Prime City Limited, the Sahara group company, which is planning to issue an IPO, had informed about its group in its preamble to SEBI on September 30, 2009
 sebi ne ghoshnaaon ko naakaafi maanate hue niyamon ke mutabik sahaara kii kuch companiyon ke bare main soochna maangi
 Then in a war of words, Additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran said in his opinion on the matter, "I understand that unlisted companies like Sahara Group, which do not want to list themselves, do not fall under sebi's jurisdiction
" Huh
 '' sahaara ne parasaran kii raay ko aadhaar banaate hue kaha ki yah maamla sebi ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin aata he kyonki company company maamalon ke mantralay or company register ke adhikaar kshetra main aati he
 When asked by SEBI to follow its order immediately, Sahara sent a report to the Ministry of Company Affairs through a letter dated May 31, 2010, asking it to clarify that the rights of the Ministry of Company Affairs to their company It comes in the area or of SEBI
 17 june, 2010 ko mantralay ne sahaara ko jaankaree di ki maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 He then referred the case to the Ministry of Law and Justice, where Parasaran, as a law officer of the government, found that unlisted companies do not fall under the jurisdiction of SEBI

 In November 2010, it issued show cause notices to Sahara Group companies SCSCL and SHICL in an interim order, through which they were submitted to the Registrar of Companies for red herring prospectus dated March 12, 2008 and October 6, 2009, respectively
 The public was stopped from raising money
 aisa unhone 1956 ke company kanoon kii dhara 60bi ke tahat kiya
 Those companies were also instructed not to offer their equity shares / OFCDS or any other securities to the public

 On 15 July 2011, while sending the case to the tribunal for decision, the Supreme Court directed that the Ministry of Company Affairs be made a party to the case
 mantralay ne prativedakon ko apana javaabi shapath-patr daakhil karne ko kaha
 Following this, the Ministry filed its counter affidavit on 26 August 2011 and Sahara on 30 August 2011 against Memo of Appeal
 lekin apane javaabi shapath patr main mantralay ne ekadam ulataa rukh apanaate hue kaha ki is maamle main sebi ko faisla lene kaa adhikaar he
 He also ignored the opinion of the Law Ministry
 usne lakhanu hycourt main apane pehle ke rukh se bhi alag rukh le liya
 Sahara then sent a new report to the ministry on 30 August 2011

 Rajendra Yadav, the superstar of Hindi literature, has seen 83 outings in life and 83 films
 ve 65 saal se likh rahe hai
 25 years passed while editing Hans
 abhi kuch dinon pehle varisht aalochak namvar singh se lekar lekhika krishna sobati samet hindi ke tamaam lekhakon ne unke ghar ekatrit hokar unka lok sammaan kiya to kitni puraani yaaden or sapane phir se sataha par tairne lage
 In fact, he has written a lot about himself and more than that by his friends and enemies
 lekin kuch or ankaha jaan lene kii lalak baatcheet kaa sabab bani
 At this stage of age, they will say something that has never been said before
 cigarette kaa ek packet baatcheet kii shart thi
 Although doctors have given him strict instructions not to smoke cigarettes, but what good is the status of a doctor before his life
 lok sammaan ke din bhi lakh manaa karne ke baavjood unhone sabake saamne cigarette sulgaai
 Now friends and family do not allow drinking, then drink secretly and pour ashes into the toilet
 kamaleshwar or mohan rakesh ke saath unhone nai kahani andolan kii shuruyaat kii
 Wrote novels and stories
 unke mashhoor upanyaas sara akaash par baad main basu chatarji ne film bhi banaai
 Now Rajendra ji is getting old and weak, but like Mana is still young
 bhale sharir saath nahin detaa, lekin kalpanaaen saath tikti bhi nahin hai
 On which places do they fly and sit
 unki baton kaa sira nahin miltaa
 Referring to the most tender feeling of love, he suddenly starts saying, "the debt of two lives is on me, which i wasted
" '' koun? ''mannu or mita
 No one knows who Mita is, but his 81-year-old wife and well-known Hindi writer, Mannu Bhandari, hears this confession, saying, "now what if you realized? i had only one life, which passed away in sorrow and loneliness
 25 saal pehle beti rachana ke janm ke baad se rajendra ke saath meraa koi shaareerik sambandh nahin rahaa
 My life was Mentally, Emotionally, Sectually Bankrupt
 ganimat he ki ab aakhri dinon main unhen is baat kaa ehsaas ho rahaa he
 "25 years no relation?" It was a shock to know
 kya rajendra ji ko is pidaa kaa ehsaas he? ve kehete hai, ''haa, main samajhataa hum us takalif ko, lekin main kar kya saktaa tha? tab mita meri jindagi main thi
 i have never had a physical relationship with two women in my life
 mita ke rahete main mannu ke saath aise sambandhon ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Are you Casanova in Hindi? They smile
 ''yahi sab kahkar to tum log mujhe bhadqaate rahete ho
 "they do not say precisely in these words that the basic need for writing creativity is 'woman', but some quote Hemingway in this manner
 ''hemingve ne likhaa he ki mere jivan main aane vaali har nai stri ne mujhe nayaa upanyaas diya
 "why Hemingway, if only to believe in writing, the old male characters of many writers, including Nobokov and Markhej, live in the hands of a beautiful, young girl
" kya in sabko naitikta kii ek hi jhaadoo se buhaar diya jaae? ghatiya, yon kunthit, mardwaadi? lekin phir is sawaal kaa jawaab koun degaa ki aisa kya he ki un buudhe charitron se nafrat nahin hoti
 This is a strange game of love and hate
 jis bebaaki or aazaadee se rajendra apane prem kii baaten sweekaar karte hai, is sexual freedom par bahut-si mahilaayein unhen utani hi aasaani se kairactor certificate de detii hai, jise mard lakh guna zyada aasaani se auraton ko diya karte hai
 But this certificate is cheap and feudal
 ise dene vaala mard ho yaa aurat
 But there is also a screwy and masochistic contradiction in this qualifying Bayabaki
 yah poochne par ki yadi aapke jaisaa jivan mannu ne jiya hota, vaise hi vivaahettar sambandh banaae hote to aapaki kya pratikriya hoti? ve kehete hai, ''main yah bardaasht nahin kar paata
 Mannu is unable to forgive
 '' asal antarvirodh yahi he
 On one hand, he says, "my whole life is a struggle for freedom from rules and restrictions
" niyam todna hi meraa niyam tha
 "on the other hand, if they break the rules of Manu, then they have trouble
 aakhir vahi sawaal ki is mardwaadi niyam ko ve kyon nahin tod paae?lekin kamaal kii cheez he unka democratic ravaiya
 On this answer you can get angry at that 83-year-old elder, call him good and feudal but he will smile and say, "it is true, but also think it is 20 years old
" aaj main aisa nahin sochataa
 "but even on this answer you can curse them and they will listen with pleasure
" ''weldon, apane liye aazaadee to javaani main hi chun lee, aurat kii aazaadee kaa ehsaas budhaape main ho rahaa he
 "but why should men feel the freedom of woman?" Whether or not a woman is seriously destitute, she will think and decide
 rajendra ji par danda chalaane ke hajaaron maukey namoodaar hote rahete hai
 When women wrote freely, Vibhutinarayan Rai gave them the title of 'chhinal'
 rajendra ji se ummid kii gai ki ve unki bakhiya udhedenge, lekin ve to kehane lage, ''unhone galat kaha, lekin kya iske liye use faansee par latakaaogi? in tippaniyon kii itani parvaah kyon? chhinaal kehete hai to kehane do
 You say that yes, i am a crook, what will you do
 '' is par phir unhen kairactor certificate jari hue
 But their side is clear, "why should women give a clarification in response to 'cheenal Ho'," No, we are good Indian women
 ' na, ham acchhee nahin hai
 Neither was, nor will be
 tum jo chaahe kaho, lekin hamaare bauddhik vikaas, hamaari aazaadee kii udaan ko roak nahin sakate
 But when the controversy started between Rajendra and Maitreyi about this controversy, all the masculine voices of Hindi started to fire against Maitreyi
 ve kahati hai ki kai purush lekhakon ne mujh par aarope lagaaya, ''rajendra ji ne unhen lekhika banaaya, or aaj pahchaan ban gai to unhen dhokhaa dekar chalati baniin
 "maitreyi is hurt because this comment is terrible
" aapako nahin lagata ki darasal 20 auraton ke saath sona utana saamanti or mardwaadi nahin he, jitna ki kisi aurat par use lekhika banane kaa ehsaan ladanaa? sawaal rajendra ji ke saamne tha or jawaab tha, ''ye bahut purushavaadi coment he
 Did not do the favor by printing the story
 ye kahana ki 'maine bana diya', bahut pitrusattatmak tippanee he
 As long as my and Maitreyi's friendship was, it was very intimate and selfless
 ''jindagi ke kathghare main khadey rajendra khud bhi har mukademe main khud ko clin chit dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 He says, "I will take the burden of my guilt and my life with me
" sochataa hum to dil kaanp jaataa he ki jo bitiyaa aaj beemaari main raat-din meri dekhbhaal kar rahi he, bachapan main maine uski taraf dekha tak nahin
 Never even sat for one hour and talked to him
 '' lekin rachana is bare main ab nahin sochatin
 The ravages of time have forgotten all the gum, erased the wounds
 ve khush hai yah sochakar ki ''papa ne jaisi bhi jindagi chaahi, ji
 They are popular, people know them
 mujhe koi shikaayat nahin
 "how many more Rajendras reside inside Rajendra?" Left home, wife and daughter were left with everyone, but they are still holding tight to literature
 haalanki ve kehete hai ki aaj bhi ekant bhoga rahaa hum
 When asked why Mita did not hold her hand after separating from Mannu, Rajendra, who broke the rules, starts to cry for social rules
 ''main bina shaadi ke uske saath nahin rah saktaa tha
 Had to face problems in society
 '' mannu bifer jaati hai
 When did he care about the society, which he is doing today
 ek shaadi karke doosraa rishta rakh sakate the, lekin bina shaadi ke saath rahane se gurej he
 Now even Manu has no complaints
 rajendra kaa maun kahata he ki pilaa de ok se saki, jo hamase nafrat he / piyaala gar nahin detaa, na de, sharaab to de
 And the condition of Mannu is that he is not asked, nor is he to be spoken to us
 unase rajendra kii bevafaaiyon or bedili ke bare main sawaal karen to kahati hai ki meri kitaab ek kahani yah bhi pard lo, jabaki unka maun kahata he ki ishk mujhko nahin, vahshat hi sahi
 The story of every pain of Mannu ends at this point, "I used to love Rajendra
 unamem bahut-si buraaiyaan hai to achchhaaiyaan bhi hai
 This is the hypnosis of his personality
 ''rajendra pichley 25 saal se hindi kii sabase popular saahitiyik patrika hans kaa safaltaapurvak sampadan kar rahe hai
 Through this magazine, he first raised issues related to women, Dalits and Muslims
 nae rachanakaaron ko plateform diya or is plateform ne ek darjan se zyada nae achche lekhak paidaa kiye
 Perhaps she is the only person in Hindi who says very openly that a woman should be free from body bondage
 is sectuel freedom se koi etraj nahin, lekin iske aage kya? vah kya he, jo sexual freedom se bhi zyada jaruri he
 Rajendra says, "women should be self-sufficient, break into the power of literature
" takat or pojishan hasil kare
 "asking if after 25 years you would like to sit on top and see a woman in the highest chair of Hans," he says, "yes, i want that to happen
" ''is samay hindi ke galiyaaron main ek sawaal sabase zyada kulbula rahaa he ki unke baad hans or akshar prakaashan kaa uttaradhikari koun hoga? rajendra ji kehete hai, ''vah, jo jimmedaari uthaane ke kaabil hoga
 By the way, i have decided to give this responsibility to four people, daughter Rachna, Sanjay Sahai, Veena Uniyal and Sangam Pandey
 ye sabhi milakar hans kii jimmedaari sanbhaalenge
 "rajendra is a Hindi villain to the biggest friends of all, Yarbash, Allrounder and Jindal
 unke saath rahane vaale ladke kishan or uske parivaar ke liye ve pita se badhkar hai
 His colleague Veena Uniyal never felt like a boss
 dost unase pyaar karte hai
 Girls still live on this old Casanova
 ajeeb paheli he ki usee ko dekhakar jite hai, jis kafir par dam nikle
 Rajendra turns around and says, "I have given my life to literature
" '' chaahate the ki ek lekhak ke rup main unki pahchaan badi hoti, lekin unhen dukh he is baat kaa ki hans ke sampadak ke rup main unki pahchaan lekhkeey pahchaan se zyada badi ho gai
 Some stories are still incomplete
 ummid he, puri hongi ek din
 Thousands of such unfulfilled wishes come true every day
 rajendra par jindagi kaa mukadmaa jari he
 There is a long list of allegations and counter-allegations
 khushi ke sabase saghan kshan hai or dukh kii sabase lambii raaten
 Some such guilt, some pain they will take with them, which was not a recipe to get rid of in any book of the world
 sharaab, dost, stri, prem, koi us marz kii dawa na ban sakaa
 There was only one life
 jikar khatm kar di
 Slipped at every turn, wandered in every street
 galatiyon kaa ambara laga diya
 But there is no reverse button in life
 jo biit gai, so baat gai
 But where do things go from the heart
 yaad banakar baithi rahati hai
 At this threshold of age, the arrogance of memories in the heart of Rajendra, a friend sitting at his head, can hardly raise his hand and touch him
 ve kehete hai, ''kuch dard hamen akele hi jhelane hote hai
 Nobody comes to share the life's solitude
 '' Law Minister Salman Khurshid, strongly defending the remarks on the promise of reservation in jobs for minorities, told the Election Commission that they have only expressed their intentions, this is not a policy announcement

 Singhvi said, "the person concerned was not speaking as a Union Minister

 team india mushkilon main hai
 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar has fever
 vahiin pehali pari ke dauraan jahir khan kii mansapeshi khinch gai he
 Sachin Tendulkar batted despite a fever during India's first innings in the first cricket Test against England and returned to the team hotel as soon as he was out
 100 antarrashtriya shatakon se keval ek kadam dur tendulkar jab do wicket par 77 ran ke score par maidan par utre to unhen tej bukhaar tha
 He kept England's batsmen out of success until lunch and hit six boundaries in the second season
 unhone apni lagbhag dedh ghante kii pari ke dauraan 58 gend kaa saamana karte hue 34 ran banaaye
 Tendulkar returned to the team hotel after getting caught in the second slip off Stuart Broad's ball and it is learned that he preferred to rest with antibiotics
 sachin tendulkar ko jald mil saktaa he bharat ratnabharat ko agar england ko chaar test kii shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat lene se rokna he to tendulkar kaa feet hona team ke liye ahm hoga
 Tendulkar did not even take the field for fielding on Saturday during five overs of England's second innings due to fever
 tendulkar ko agar apane niyamit sthaan number chaar par ballebaaji karne utarana he to unhen ravivaar ko chauthe din england kii duusari pari ke dauraan kshetrarakshan karnaa hoga
 If this veteran player fails to do so, then he will be able to bat only after falling five wickets during India's second innings
 england ke pehali pari main aath wicket par 474 ran par pari ghoshit ke jawaab main bharat ne pehali pari main rahul dravid kii naabad 103 ran kii pari kii madad se 286 ran banaaye the
 At the same time, Zaheer Khan's muscle was pulled during the first innings, after which he did not appear on the field 
 ballebaaji ke liye bhi jahir ranor se saath khele
 After that, he has not yet landed in the second innings of England
 unke siries ke duusare test main khilne par bhi andeh jataayaa ja rahaa he, jo shuukravaar se nottingham main hoga

 kabhi desh main cricket kaa garh rahe green park stadium bhartiya team ke liye kaaphi bhaagyashaalee rahaa he
 India has played a total of 11 matches on this ground so far, winning eight of them
 ab jabaki aaj bharat ko westeindies ke saath yahaan chal rahi siries kaa teesraa match khelnaa he, mahendra singh dhoni kii team is maidan par hetric ke saath siries jeetna chaahegi
 In the three-match series, both teams are 1-1
 bharat ne kochi main jeet hasil karte hue 1-0 kii badhat banaai thi, lekin westeindies ne vishakhapattanam main jeet ke saath barabari kar lee
 India played the last match in Kanpur in 2008
 usne us match main england ko 16 ranon se haraaya tha
 Before that the Indian team had defeated Pakistan by 46 runs at this ground in November 2007
 is maidan par bharat ko pakistan se ek baar or westeindies se do baar haar mili he
 For the West Indies, this ground has been more fortunate than India
 is team ne is maidan par do match khele hai or donon main hi use jeet mili he
 In 1994, West Indies beat India by 46 runs and before that they defeated Sri Lanka by 25 runs in 1987 World Cup
 aankaden chahen jo bhi kahani bayaan karen, lekin bharat ke liye carabian team se paar paanaa mushkil hoga
 The way Darren Sammy led his team to victory and the way four batsmen hit half-centuries, it is clear that the Caribbean batsmen have returned to rhythm
 bharat ke liye is match main toss jeetna behad jaruri hoga, kyonki toss haarane kii surat main carabian team ek baar phir gendbaaji karnaa pasand karegi, kyonki kanpur main os khub girti he or is kaaran bhartiya gendbaajon ko khaasi pareshaani ho sakati he
 In Visakhapatnam, dew started falling in the final moments of the match and due to this the Indian bowlers made a lot of mistakes
 geeli gend se bhubaneshwar ne phultos genden phenki, jo aamtaur par vah nahin phenkate
 In such a situation, captain Dhoni's eye will be on the toss first
 pradarshan ke lihaaj se bharat ko apni gendbaaji main sudhaar karnaa hoga, kyonki antim match se yahi ek kamjor kadi saamne ai he
 Though the bowlers in Kochi had made India's job easier, the conditions in Kanpur would be completely different from Kochi and the bowlers would have to start afresh
 timen is prakaar hai-bharat:mahendra singh dhoni (captain), rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli, suresh raina, yuvaraj singh, ravichandran aswin, mohammad shami, bhubaneshwar kumaar, rabindra jadeja, mohit sharma
 West Indies: Dwayne Bravo (captain), Kieran Powell, Darren Bravo, Johnson Charles, Jason Holder, Sunil Naren, Veerasamy Paramoll, Ravi Rampal, Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels, l Simmons

 a round of accusations between the Congress and the BJP over the Dholpur Palace continues
 congress kaa kahana he ki ye sarkari sampatti he, jabaki bijepi kaa daawa he ki dhaulpur mahal vasundhara raaje ke bete or bijepi saansad dushyant singh kii sampatti he
 The party stands completely in defense of Vasundhara and her son Dushyant on this issue
 party ne bachaav main kaha ki "congress court ke faisle kii copy ko thik se padhe or samajhe
 This palace belongs to Dushyant Singh
 " dushyant singh jhalwar-baaran seat se bhaajapa saansad hai
 However, this matter is still incomprehensible as to who owns the Dholpur palace
 congress har din nae-nae dastauez pesh kar congress bijepi kii mushkilen badha rahi he
 Yesterday, he presented four documents claiming to own the palace of the Rajasthan government
 party ne saaf kaha he ki jab tak vasundhara raaje istipha nahin de deteen tab tak is maamle kaa kjoger nahin hoga or vah discloger nahin karegi or lagaataar dastavej saamne laakar maamle ko uthaati rahegi
 Earlier on Wednesday, the Congress introduced four new documents, accusing the Raje Parivar family of illegal occupation of the palace
 congress kii taraf se pesh varsh 1949 ke ek kaagazat main dhaulpur mahal ko sarkari sampati bataaya gaya he or maharaja udai bhaan singh ke jivit rahane tak hi ye mahal unke paas rahane kii baat kii gai he
 The second document was a copy of the judgment of the Additional District Judge of Bharatpur dated May 17, 2007, which states that the agreement between Hemant Singh and Dushyant Singh is for movable property and not for immovable property
 jairam ramesh kehete hai ki is kaagazaat ke baad to kehane ke liye kuch bachaa hi nahin rah jaataa
