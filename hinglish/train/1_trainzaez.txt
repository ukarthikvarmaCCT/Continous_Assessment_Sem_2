 It is believed that visiting Morya Gosavi temple leads to the attainment of virtue similar to the worship of Ashtavinayak
 is mandir main na keval bappa kaa adbhut rup virajman he balki bappa ke param bhakt morya gosaavi ke saath-saath unke aath vanshajon kii samadhi bhi he jo ganpati ke prati inaki aasthaa kii kahani sunaati he
 What is common and what is the faith of every devotee in the Morya Gosavi temple, that is why devotees from all over the country come here with Bappa to see his supreme devotee Gosavi Ji
 pune ke chinchvaad gaanv ke morya gosaavi mandir main har roj hajaaron bhakt ganesh ji or morya gosaavi ke darshan ke liye aate hai
 One such devotee is Bollywood film actress Rajshri Desh Pandey, who comes to Pune from Mumbai to visit the Morya Gosavi temple
 rajshri desh pandey kaa is mandir par atoot vishwaas he
 She says that her every wish is fulfilled by coming to this temple and with this belief she comes to this temple from Mumbai to Pune to worship Lord Ganesha and Morya Gosavi
 morya gosaavi mandir main ganpati ke darshan ke liye aane vaale bhakton ke mutabit yahaan aane vaale har bhakt kii manokamana puri hoti he
 Devotees say that Ganapati Bappa gave a boon to Morya Gosavi that the name of Morya will remain associated with Ganapati for all eternity and perhaps that is the reason why people associate Morya's name with Ganapati as well
 puure maharashtra ke alag-alag ilaakon se bhakt pune ke chinchvaad main morya gosaavi mandir main maththa techne aate hai
 There is an influx of devotees here

 After 9 / 11, there was an uproar and he changed the name of his terrorist organization lashkar-e-tayyaba to dodge the world
 nayaa naam rakhaa jamaat-ud-daawa iske baad mumbai main 26 / 11 hua to usne phir vahi khel khelaa
 Changed the name of Abki jamaat-ud-dawa and then renamed it tehreek-e-hurmat-e-rasool
 par khel vahi tha
 To spread terror
 magar ab lashkar ke chif hafiz said ke chehere se mukhauta hat gaya he
 Because after the United Nations, America has now declared jamaat-ud-dawa and its allied organizations as terrorist organizations
 behad purana he aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar kaa ye pintara, kabhi cheharaa, to kabhi thikaana, to kabhi naam badal kar duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne kaa uskaa apana aajamaaya fareb

 phir mumbai hamale ke baad duniya bhar kii suraksha agenciyon kii najaron se bachane ke liye hafiz said ne vahi puraani chaal chali
 The jamaat-ud-dawa, or the religious face of Lashkar, has once again changed
 jamaat ud daawa ab ban gaya tha taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul
 The intention of Hafiz Saeed was clear that whenever his terrorist organization is banned, he will continue to change his name and spew jihad poison
 kabhi charity ke naam par, kabhi mahajab ke naam par
 In fact, after the Mumbai attacks, the Security Council of the United Nations had also banned the Pakistani organization jamaat-ud-dawa
 auki uske liye is naam se duniya ke kisi kone main kaam karnaa mushkil hone laga tha isiilie hafiz said ne nai chaal chali thi
 Such a move that he had tried many times before with success
 lekin uske iraade ab bhi utane hi khatarnaak the
 He still wanted to beat the world of jihad
 pehle kii tarah badale hue naam se
 But now after United Nations, America has also declared jamaat-ud-dawa as terrorist organization
 itnaa hi nahin jamaat ke saath-saath iske sahyogi sanghathan taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul or al anphal trust ko bhi aatankwaadi sanghathan qaraar diya he
 Along with this, the US has also declared Nazir Ahmad Chaudhary and Mohammed Hussain Gill as international terrorists in an allegation to raise funds and network for these two organizations
 in donon par hafiz said ke liye kaam karne kaa iljaam he
 The US and the United Nations have already named Hafiz Saeed in the list of the world's most dangerous terrorists
 itnaa hi nahin uske sir par america ne das million dollar yani kareeb 60 karod kaa inaam bhi rakhaa hua he

 The Australian team usually adopts the strategy of sledging to put pressure on the leading batsman of the opposition team, but Kohli's awe is such that he is reluctant to work against Kohli

 In fact, like Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli also has the same specialty that any kind of spanking against him inspires him to perform better and the Australian team certainly would not like it

 'he said that each region would have all the infrastructure, including research laboratories and convention centers in Science City, where conferences could be held

 Describing corruption and black money as the biggest issue of the country, yoga guru Baba Ramdev has said that in the upcoming elections, his organization will support Bharatiya Janata Party PM candidate Narendra Modi only if he wants to bring back the black money stashed abroad
 Will assure about baba ramdev ne kaha, hamaare kai mudde hai
 The issue of black money is the most prominent among them, because there is so much money in foreign banks that if all of them are brought here, then every village part of the country will get crores of rupees
 in rupayon se bharat ke prayek gaanv ko viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 Ramdev, who brought revolution in the field of yoga, said, 'if Narendra Modi assures me of bringing back black money, then only i will support him
 haalanki, bijepi bhi kaale dhan ko waapas laana chaahati he or vyaktigat taur par modi eemaandaar vyakti hai
 So, i think he too can agree on this issue
 baba ramdev ne bataaya ki vah nai dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main ek raily karne vaale hai
 Before this, he will discuss these issues with the BJP leadership and his issues are agreed only then he can make a formal announcement to support Modi in this rally
 haalanki, baba ne iske saath hi yah bhi kaha ki congress or bijepi donon bhrasht party he, lekin congress or uske tamaam netaa bhrashtachar main duube hai
 But this is not the case with BJP
 is party ke kuch netaa bhrasht hai lekin iskaa sheersh netritv bilkul saaf suthri chhavi kaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi rallied in Punjab for the first time after declaring the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of the Kharif crop
 muktsar ke malot kii is raily ke jariye piem modi kii najar mukhya taur par kisaanon par thi
 Modi's rally may have been presented as 'kisan Kalyan Rally', but it also has some political significance
 darasal, dakshini punjab ke malot main modi ke raily karne kaa uddeshy bijepi ke liye punjab main kisaan vot bank hasil karnaa he
 Because after the recent announcement made by the government about MSP, if the farmers of a state will benefit the most, then they are the farmers of Punjab
 aankadon par najar daudai jaae to punjab main paidaa hone vaale dhan or gehun kaa90 fisdihissaa sarkari kray kendron par kharida jaataa he
 In such a situation, the announcements made recently about MSP will have a direct impact on the farmers vote bank here
 emspi ko lekar sarkaar kii ghoshnaa kaa phayda unheen ilaakon main kisaanon ko milane ja rahaa he, jahaan unki upaj sidhe sarkari kray kendron main jaati he
 According to agricultural experts, only 35 percent of the total yield of wheat and paddy in the country goes to government purchasing centers
 dalhan or tilhan ke maamle main to yah ausat or bhi kharaab hokar 20-25 fisadi par thahar jaataa he
 Due to the production of the best quality food grains in Punjab, most of the grain here is purchased at government purchasing centers
 punjab ke alaava in rajyon par bhi he najaraiske alaava piem modi 'kisaan kalyaan raily' ke jariye modi punjab, haryana va rajasthan ke kisaanon par bhi nishaanaa saadhenge
 The reason behind this is the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in 2019
 bataa den ki 2019 main los chunaav ke sathharyana main vidhansabha chunaavbhee hai
 Before this, there will be assembly elections in Rajasthan
 aise main is raily main centre va pradesh ke bhaajapa-akali netaa kisaan vot bank hasil karne kii koshish karenge
 Doubling the income of farmers is why the challenge is that the Modi government has set a target of doubling the income of farmers in the country by 2022
 is lakshya tak pahunchane kii koshish sarkaar ne 2015 main shuru kar di hoti to 2022 tak kisaanon kii vaarshik aamadani main lagaataar 7 varshon tak 12 fisadi kaa ijapha hota or tay lakshya praapt kar liya jaataa, lekin aisa ho nahin sakaa
 During the budget session in 2015, Prime Minister Modi promised to double farmers' income in seven years
 iske baad pesh hue sabhi kendriya bajaton main is vaade ko doharaaya gaya
 But for three years, the government did not make its roadmap to fulfill this promise tied to the 2022 target
 beete teen saal tak kii krishi kshetra kii sthiti ko dekhte hue lagata he ki die gaye samay main is lakshya ko paanaa centre sarkaar ke liye mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin he
 To achieve this goal, the Central Government constituted an inter-ministerial Committee under the chairmanship of Ashok Dalwai
 is samiti ne beete do saal ke dauraan desh ke krishi kshetra kaa saghan adhyayan karte hue apni report taiyaar kii he
 The Ministry has currently sought the suggestion of the public on this report, after which it is expected to complete its report and submit a recommendation to the Central Government on the formula for doubling the income of farmers
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki pradesh main bijepi or argedy ek-duusare ke saath hai or donon hi mil-julkar chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai
 He said that Lalu Prasad's party RJD and Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP are victims of frustration, hence misrepresentation
 nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri ke bare main kaha ki unhen tathyon kii jaankaree nahin he
 Significantly, the first Prime Minister had criticized the Nitish government and said that the state government did not implement the Central schemes properly

 gujarat ke charchit ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main aaropee do varisht police adhikariyon enke amin or tie barot ne apane pad se istipha de diya
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had sought an answer from the Gujarat government on the appointment of these two officers, after which these officers gave an affidavit in the court and informed them about their resignation

 However after that he was again appointed as SP of Mahisagar district of Gujarat on a one-year contract
 vahiin barot ko ritairement ke ek saal baad pichley saal oktober maheene main vadodara main pashchimi railway ke police upaadheekshak pad par niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Barot was also an accused in the Ishrat Jahan and Sadiq Jamal encounter cases

 The bench then disposed of the petition of former IPS officer Rahul Sharma against the re-recruitment of both police officers
 purv ipies adhikari sharma ne vakil virendra kumaar sharma ke jariye daayar apni yachika main supreme court ke us aadesh kaa zikr kiya, jisamen gujarat sarkaar ko rajya ke sheersh police adhikari peepi pandeya kii police mahanideshak or police mahanireekshak ke pad chhodane kii peshkash sweekaar karne kii ijaajat di gai thi
 Sharma had challenged in the Supreme Court the dismissal of the petition filed by the Gujarat High Court against the re-recruitment of both police officers who had been in custody for eight years
 yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya ki muthbhed ke do maamalon main sibiai ke aarope patr main amin kaa naam aayaa tha or vah pehle hi lagbhag aath saal nyaayik hiraasat main rah chuke hai
 Not only this, soon after his release, he was appointed to the post of SP
 barot bhi teen saal rahe nyaayik hiraasat menisamen kaha gaya, iske alaava tarun barot bhi apharan or hatya ke maamalon main aaropee rah chuke hai, aarope patr main unka naam bhi aayaa he
 He has also been arrested in these cases and has also been in judicial custody for almost three years
 lekin rajya ne barot kii rihaai ke turant baad unhen vadodara main pashchimi railway kaa upaadheekshak bana diya
 According to the petition, knowing that the history of the two officers had been doubtful, he was given the appointment which is in violation of the Supreme Court guidelines
 yah janvishwaas ke siddhant kaa bhi ulanghan he
 In such a situation, keeping in mind the serious charges against Amin and his jail for eight years, he directed the Gujarat government to take a decision on Thursday on the appointment of the post of SP after Amin's retirement

 In fact, Sehwag was dropped from Team India for the third and fourth Test matches after the visitors failed miserably in the first two matches against Australia, and then it was decided that Dhawan and Murali Vijay would open the innings in Mohali
 shikhar dhawan shrunkhlaa se pehle ghoshit kii gai 15-sadasyeey test team main shaamil the, lekin sahvaag or murali jaise anbhavi khilaadiyon ke rahete unhen apane kariyar kaa aagaaz karne kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 However, Shikhar Dhawan has experience of scoring a lot of runs in domestic cricket and that is why he is not nervous before his debut
 shikhar ne kaha he ki vah ek anbhavi khilaadi ke taur par apana pehla test match khelenge
 The comments duusari ore, dilli kii team ke unke saathi ishanth sharma mohali main apane kariyar kaa 50waan test khelenge, haalanki 50 test maichon kaa unka safar khaas acha nahin rahaa he, kyonki unka ausat acha nahin he
 Actually, 38 for a specialist bowler

 Shikhar Dhawan was included in the 15-man Test squad announced before the series, but he did not get a chance to begin his career with experienced players like Sehwag and Murali
 vaise shikhar dhawan ke paas gharelu cricket main dheron ran banane kaa anubhav he or isi kaaran vah apane aagaaz se pehle ghabaraae hue nahin hai

 tippaniyan On the other hand, his Delhi teammate Ishant Sharma will play the 50th Test of his career in Mohali, although his journey of 50 Test matches has not been very good, because his average is not good
 darasal, ek visheshgy gendbaaj ke liye 38
 An average of 52 is not considered good and that is why Ishant, who has started his international career with a lot of bang, has not been included in the list of top bowlers so far
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki 50 ke aasapaas test match khilne vaale visheshgy gendbaajon main kisi kaa bhi ausat ishanth jitna kharaab nahin rahaa he, lekin ab ishanth ke paas mohali main acha pradarshan karne kaa mauka he, kyonki yahaan kii pich unki madad kar sakati he

 yahi vah daur tha jab dalit andolan ne bhi jor pakadaa or kanshiram ke andolan se mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party kaa udai hua
 However, the politics of backward and Dalit politics in Tamil Nadu of South India had emerged in the form of Dravidian movement in the sixties only
 pichhadon kii raajnneeti kaa ek pahalu yah bhi tha ki congress in rajyon main haashie par pahunchati gai
 The representation of backward in the Congress has always been very low, that is why even today only a few big backward leaders are seen in it
 kehane ko seetaram kesari jarur kuch samay ke liye congress adhyaksh ban gaye the lekin unki koi khaas pakad nahin thi
 Now surely leaders like Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot are seen
 idhar, jarur congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pichhadi jatiyon par focus badhaayaa he
 In the nineties, along with the Sangh Parivar and the BJP, the feeling of making inroads into the OBC and Dalit castes deepened and instead of the social justice slogan of Mandal politics, social engineering strategy was devised
 bhaajapa main laalkrishna adwani kii aguai main ke
 N
 govindacharya is soshal ejineering kii ranneeti ke sutaradhar the
 Therefore, leaders like Kalyan Singh, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar emerged
 isi kadi main aage chalakar narendra modi or shivaraj singh chouhan jaise netaa mukhyadhara main apana sthaan banane main kaamyaab ho paae
 But after the nineties, about three-and-a-quarter decades, much water has flowed into the Ganges
 pichde netaa apni chamak khone lage or parivaarwaad tathaa ek khaas jati ke aise pairokaar main tabdeel hote gaye jinase baaki pichhadi jatiyon kaa mohabhang hone laga tha
 For example, Lalu Yadav's RJD and Mulayam's Samajwadi Party became parties of Yadavs
 isse ati pichhadon ko golband karne ke liye kurmi jati se sambandh rakhane vaale bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bihar main ati pichhadaa varg, mahadalit or pasmanda (pichde) musalamaanon kii golbandi shuru karke apni ahmiyat sabit kii
 Now Upendra Kushwaha of Koyari caste, who was with him once in Bihar, also claims new mobilization of the backward
 kushvaha centre main mantri bhi hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, especially in 2009, the most backward votes went from Mulayam to Congress, which secured 22 parliamentary seats in the state
 magar 2014 ke aam chunaavon ne yah sara ganit puri tarah badal diya or pichhadon ke netaa ketaur par modi ne bhi daawa thoka
 Recall that Priyanka Gandhi of Congress blamed Modi for her "low politics" on Modi's attack on her father, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and Modi tried to gain sympathy by citing it as being of lower caste
 bhaajapa ko modi ke naam par mili khaskar ati pichhadon ke voton ne itihaas rach diya
 For this reason, the most emphasis on backward votes is seen in politics today
 uttar bharat ke duusare rajyon main pichhadi raajnneeti ab karavat badal rahi he
 The obcs in Rajasthan have 91 castes of obcs in the state list in Rajasthan and among these, Jats are the most influential caste, whose population share is considered to be 9 to 12 percent
 jat vidhayakon kii sankhya 25 se zyada he
 The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly is Rameshwar Lal Dudi Jat but there is no major Jat leader in both Congress and BJP
 rajya kii bhaajapa sarkaar main mantri ram pratap ko bhaajapa kaa pramukh jat netaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Most of the OBC leaders in the state have been affected locally but two big Congress leaders are the exception
 mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar sachin payalat gurjar hai to purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot mali jati se hai
 Pilot is the state Congress president
 mali jati se rajya main teen vidhayak hai jabaki gurjar vidhayakon kii sankhya chah he
 Government minister Prabhulal Saini is a prominent leader of the BJP from the Mali community
 yahaan obisi koi sangathit rajnatik shakti nahin he kyonki jatiyon kii aapasi samasyaayein hai
 For example, before the Jats got OBC status, the Gurjars always believed that Mali was killing their share in the reservation
 jaaton ko darja mila to gurjar apane liye anusuchit janajati kaa darja dene kii maang karne lage or maalion ne obisi kii mul suchi alag karne kii maang rakhi, jisamen jat na hon
 Apart from Jats, there are some prominent castes like Gurjar, Mali, Bishnoi, Kumawat, Sindhi Muslim, Rawat and Yadav, which have 15 mlas and about 30 seats with the influence of these castes
 jaaton ke asar vaali siton kii sankhya kareeb 40 he
 Overall, there are 50 to 60 seats in Rajasthan with the influence of OBC castes but their number of mlas is not possible
 ek baat yah bhi saamne ai he ki obisi kaa darja milane ke baad se jat pratyaashiyon kaa jeetna mushkil ho gaya he
 The number of Jat mlas is decreasing as voters from other castes are voting in favor of non-jat candidates
 haalanki bhaajapa ne kaaphi sankhya main jat afasaron ko mahatvapurn ohadon par tainaat kiya he
 Jat voters are organized in many seats and BJP hopes that Jat voters will like bjp's Jat candidate
 bhaajapa ko yah bhi ummid he ki congress ko jaaton kii naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa padegaa kyonki barmer ke rajput netaa maanavendra singh ko haal hi main congress main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Jats and Rajputs have a figure of thirty-six
 madhya pradesh main pichde netaaon kaa prabhutwalekin madhya pradesh main obisi kaa ganit kuch or he
 Here Lodhi, Kurmi, Kirar, Kalar, Patidar, Jat, Khati, Meena, Kachhi and Dangi are the dominant castes of the backward classes
 madhya pradesh main pichley 15 saal se obisi mukhyamantri he jo darshata he ki is varg kii jatiyon kii rajnatik takat kya he
 Although official figures are not available, it is still believed that OBC has the highest number of Kurmi voters
 satna, reva, or sidhi main kurmiyon kii taadaad kaaphi he jabaki shajapur, panna, chhatarpur or shadol main bhi inaki acchhee maujuudagi he
 Uma Bharti Lodhi, who was the Chief Minister in 2004, Babulal Gaur Yadav, who was the Chief Minister from 2004 to 2005, while the current Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan hails from Kirar community
 pramukh yadav netaaon main pradesh congress adhyaksh arun yadav bhi hai jabaki lodhi netaaon main prahlaad patel or uma bharti kaa naam liya jaataa he
 Congress MLA Ramnivas Rawat and BJP government minister Surya Prakash Meena are the prominent Meena leaders of the state

 Indrajit Patel and Rajmani Patel of Congress and Satna MP Ganesh Singh are prominent Kurmi leaders of BJP

 BJP MLA Narayan Singh Kushwaha hails from the Kachi community
 purv kendriya mantri vikram verma or camel patel ke saath hoshangabad ke bhaajapa saansad udai pratap singh yahaan ke pramukh jat netaa hai
 The Jat population in the state is mainly in Dhar, Hoshangabad, Harda and Narsinghpur
 mana jaataa he ki pradesh main bhaajapa kii obisi main acchhee paith he
 Former Union Minister and Damoh MP Prahlad Patel says, “the backward class has acted as a bridge between Upper Cast and Lower Cast

 "obc's laboratory Biharbihar has been a major center of OBC Politics

 According to the report of the Mungeri Lal Commission, about 128 castes were identified as backward classes but more than one hundred castes have no political representation

 26 per cent of the population is of extremely backward caste (EBC)
 yahaan kii raajnneeti main 1974 ke pehle oonchi jatiyon kaa dabadabaa tha
 Kumar Anil, a senior journalist from Patna, says, "after the Mandal Commission, the backward castes came to power collectively, but this politics also remained confined to some backward castes

 According to the Central List in Haryana, 73 castes are in the backward class but Ahir, Yadav, Gurjar and Saini have seen dominance in OBC politics

 Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, while speaking to reporters on Sunday, supported the stand of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today and said that we are not in favor of mid-term elections

 It is noteworthy that Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi and five others in connection with the grant of three acres of plots to Lalu's family in 2004, during the release of Lalu Prasad's railway ministry, issued licenses for two hotels of IRCTC located in Ranchi and Puri

 In 1980, he was awarded the King Faisal Award, Personality of the Year Award by the UAE
 unhen islamic centre oxford kaa chairman bhi banaaya gaya tha
 His popularity can also be gauged from the fact that during the second Haj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1951, the doors of khan-e-kaaba were opened for Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi
 yahi nahin, unhen khan-e-kaaba kii chaabi bhi saunpi gai thi
 Apart from the emperor of Saudi Arabia, he was the only person to be given this key
 shahbaano cese main bhoomika-moulana ali miyaan siyasat main sakriy nahin rahe hai, lekin muslim maamalon ko lekar raajnneetik dalon ke saath pul kaa kaam karte the

 However, during this time, the locks of the Babri Masjid were opened for Ramlala's darshan
 haalanki, vah sidhe taur par babari masjid andolan se nahin jude the lekin sarkaar se lekar hindu pratinidhiyon se samjhaute ko lekar har mushkil vakt par unhone maargdarshan kiya
 After the Babri Masjid demolition, the Muslim Personal Law Board headed the investigation and proceedings of the case under his chairmanship

 This time, two pictures were in front of me while returning from Bastar
 pehali vah tasviir, jisamen pradhanmantri narendra modi dantewada main jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Here he says that the problem of the tribals is not the solution to the gun on the shoulder
 pradhanmantri maovadiyon se bandook chhodane kii apil karte hai or adivaasiyon ko behatar zindagi or rojgaar kaa bharosa dilaate hai
 The second picture is a meeting of tribals some distance away from this public meeting
 yahaan adivasee naare laga rahe hai, 'jaan denge par zamin nahin denge'
 
 
 Shibbu Karkam of Chidpal village is telling the people that if the Tata company plant is set up here, it will be destruction, not development
 asal main gaanv waalon ne yah meeting sarkaar kii us ghoshnaa ke baad aanan-fanan main bulaai, jisamen kaha gaya he ki dantewada ke dilamily or usase lage gaanvon main ek ultra mega steel plant lagaaya jayega
 The steel plant is being set up under a joint venture (JV) between mining company NMDC and steel maker SAIL
 isamen tata kaa naam abhi kahin nahin he, phir shibboo madkaam tata kaa naam kyon le rahe hai? yah jaanane ke liye main utsukathavash poochta hum
 This is a government company plant, where is Tata? 28-year-old Pandu Vaitti explains by pointing to the hill behind the Adivasi gathering, "you know there has been an attempt to set up a Tata steel plant in Lohandiguda for the last ten years
 logon ko murkh banaaya gaya he
 The children and elders of the village are all fighting there
 company koi bhi ho ab yahaan koi aisi yojana aati he, to ham use tata kaa hi naam dete hai
 " nijee companiyon ne pichley kai saalon main adivasee ilaakon main jamkar shoshan kiya he, lekin adivaasiyon ko uskaa phayda kabhi nahin mila he
 There is the same fear in the notes of Pandu Vaitti and Shibbu Madakam, which is clearly visible on the face of the villagers
 yahaan koi bhi company aae, unhen dar apane shoshan kaa hi he
 Suddenly at the synagogue, the voice of Ayaturam Mandavi, the sarpanch of Dillamili village, starts echoing
 "main kai baar colector se pataa karne gaya ki kya hamaare gaanv main koi aisa plant aa rahaa he, lekin har baar hamen koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 Can we trust this government? " bastar or desh ke tamaam adivasee ilaakon main aaj sabase badi samasya bharose kii kami hona he
 Not only do the tribals have faith in the government's words, they are also looking suspiciously at the leaders who come to these areas to raise their voice
 dilamily, burungpal or chidpal samet koi dhai darjan gaanv sarkaar ke is prastaavit mega steel plant ke khilaaf khadey ho gaye hai, lekin ve raajnneetik partiyon ko isse dur rakhane kii baat karte hai
 "we cannot trust leaders in this fight
 ve hamen yaa to vot bank kii tarah istemaal karenge yaa phir hamaari takat ke evaz main company se samjhauta kar paise le lenge"
 
 
 a man's voice appears while addressing the gathering
 26 saal ke narendra karma kehete hai, "yahaan plant aa rahaa he yah bataa hamen media ke zariye hi pataa lagi
 Nobody has talked to us
 pichley dinon akhabaaron main yah chhapane laga ki log is plant ke aane se khush hai
 But the people in whose name those things were printed, people of that name do not live in these villages at all
 " On the other hand, Steel Minister Narendra Singh Tomar explains to the journalists before the Prime Minister's public meeting in Dantewada, "it is true that the plant is in initial stage right now
 lekin isse adivaasiyon kaa bhala hi hoga

 "I ask- Has not the situation been corrected by the coming of NMDC plant? Pandu Vaitti -" No sir

 The government says through the news that NMDC made a profit and spent it for the good of the people, but it does not happen
 " But is it that the situation has not changed at all? Education City and Livelihood College is seen today in Dantewada, which is deserted, and the Prime Minister came here to record 'mann Ki Baat' program with tribal children, but perhaps all these efforts are still limited to the publicity system

 There is a total of 70 million tonnes of iron in Kiranadur and Bacheli of Bastar

 If you go one kilometer from there, the reality will be seen

 Not having a gun on the shoulder (employment) is the solution to the problem
 lekin kya ham in adivaasiyon ke kandhe se unka hal nahin hataa rahe? Private companies have been fiercely exploited in the tribal areas in the last several years, but the tribals have never got the benefit
 pandu vatti or shibboo madkaam ke sur main vahi dar he, jo gaanv waalon ke chehre par saaf dikh rahaa he
 Any company comes here, they fear their exploitation
 achaanak sabhasthal par dilamily gaanv ke sarpanch yturam mandavi kii awaz gunjane lagati he
 "I went to the collector several times to find out if such a plant is coming in our village, but each time we were not given any information
 kya ham is sarkaar par bharosa kar sakate hai?" Lack of trust is the biggest problem today in Bastar and all the tribal areas of the country
 adivaasiyon ko sarkaar kii baton par to bharosa he hi nahin, ve un netaaon ko bhi shaq kii nazar se dekh rahe hai jo unke liye awaz uthaane in ilaakon main aate hai
 Some two and a half dozen villages, including Dillamili, Burungpal and Chidpal, have stood up against the government's proposed mega steel plant, but they talk of keeping political parties away from it
 "ham is ladaai main netaaon par bharosa nahin kar sakate
 They will either use us as a vote bank or they will compromise with the company and take money in return for our strength ”
 
 
 sabha ko sambodhit karte hue ek aadmi kii awaz aati he
 26-year-old Narendra Karama says, "we came to know through the media that the plant is coming here
" hamase kisi ne baat tak nahin kii he
 Recently it started appearing in newspapers that people are happy with the arrival of this plant
 lekin jin logon ke naam se ve baaten chhaapi gayi, us naam ke log in gaanvon main rahete hi nahin hai
 " udhar ispaat mantri narendra singh tomars dantewada main pradhanmantri kii jansabha se pehle patrakaron ko samajhaate hai, "yah sach he ki abhi plant aarambhik sthiti main he
 But this will only benefit the tribals

 Pandu Vetti says, "sir, the situation never improves for the tribals here
 " main poochta hum- kya enemdisi kaa plant aane se halaat thik nahin hue he? pandu vatti – "nahin sar
 For the last forty years, the locals have not benefited
 sarkaar to jaise ki news ke madhyam se kahati he ki enemdisi ne munafa kiya or use logon ke bhale ke liye kharch kiya par aisa hota nahin he
 " lekin kya aisa he ki halaat bilkul nahin badale hai? sunsaan se pade rahane vaale dantewada main aaj ajukeshan city or livelihud cholez dikh rahaa he or yahaan aakar pradhanmantri ne adivasee bacchon ke saath 'man kii baat' kaarykram kii recording bhi kii lekin shaayad yah sari koshish abhi prachaar tantra tak hi simit hai
 The common people of Bastar have not benefited from this
 enemdisi ke alaava essar company pehle hi yahaan khanan kar rahi he
 Apart from this, the Tata company plans to bring its plant
 bastar ke kirandur or bacheli main kul 70 karod ton loha he
 The question is arising whether there is any need of private companies in Bastar? sabha main shaamil hone aayaa ek anya adivasee kaa kahana he, "aap andar (gaanvon main) jaakar dekhenge to pataa chalegaa ki ek bhi vyakti kaa vikaas nahin hua he
 In the area of NMDC, it is the only township where their own people live

 " main jansabha se kuch dur khadaa hokar in logon se baat kar rahaa hum
 a voice again comes from the synagogue, "if the government cannot give us a guard job, then what company will give what job? yah hamen ghanti bajaane vaale kii naukari nahin de sakati to mashin chalaane vaale kii naukari kaise degi

 Aayaturam Mandavi says, "I am not worried about that
 main naksali nahin hum
 If they put my whole family in jail, put the entire colony in jail and then plant, then we have no problem
 " Returning, i remember the words of Prime Minister Modi again
 kandhe par bandook nahin hal (rojgaar) hona hi samasya kaa hal he
 But are we not removing their solution from the shoulders of these tribals? bastar or desh ke tamaam adivasee ilaakon main aaj sabase badi samasya bharose kii kami hona he
 Not only do the tribals have faith in the government's words, they are also looking suspiciously at the leaders who come to these areas to raise their voice
 dilamily, burungpal or chidpal samet koi dhai darjan gaanv sarkaar ke is prastaavit mega steel plant ke khilaaf khadey ho gaye hai, lekin ve raajnneetik partiyon ko isse dur rakhane kii baat karte hai
 "we cannot trust leaders in this fight
 ve hamen yaa to vot bank kii tarah istemaal karenge yaa phir hamaari takat ke evaz main company se samjhauta kar paise le lenge"

 If they put my whole family in jail, put the entire colony in jail and then plant, then we have no problem
 " Returning, i remember the words of Prime Minister Modi again

 But are we not removing their solution from the shoulders of these tribals? is ilaake main maovadi nahin hai lekin ve is ilaake se bahut dur bhi nahin hai

 Not having a gun on the shoulder (employment) is the solution to the problem

 bihar ke tamaam bade netaa raajnneeti kii bisaat par bichhi baaji jeetne ke liye khub maathapai kar rahe hai or phoonk-foonkkar mohare rakh rahe hai
 Here is the 15th installment of 'bihar diary before election'
 
 
 lalu tasveeron main hataash dikh rahe hai
 After Siddiqui, now the rebellion of Ramkripal has broken Lalu from inside
 siddiki ne jabaran madhubani seat jhatak lee or ve lalu ke liye ajam khan ban gaye hai
 Lalu worries that there is no negotiator left in the party
 raghuvansh babu achche netaa hai, lekin vaachaal hai, nigoshieatre nahin
 Jai Prakash is of the 'follower' type
 ramkripal haalanki ‘laud’ the, lekin ‘loyal’ the, jisaki misaalen di jaati thim
 The rest of Lalu has given tickets to some leaders who are not well known and who have been given tickets for financial reasons
 madhepura main lalu, pappu ko tikat dena chaahate hai, jo dikhaata he ki donon jhuke hai or kamjor hue hai
 Lalu's extra confidence in Paswan's frost has come to the ground, which was seen till a few days ago
 haalanki abhi bhi 40x50 varg kilometre ke loksabhaa kshetra main chunaav ladane laayak kaddavar ummidavaar yaa to lalu ke paas hai yaa bijepi ke paas
 Nitish Kumar gave the dwarves a place in the last Lok Sabha election so that no one can raise their voice against them
 ab uskaa khamiyaja sushasan babu ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 In the thick of time only the soldiers are getting weak
 rahi baat lalu or congress ke gathjod kii, to lalu nahin chaahate ki congressiyon ke saath manch saajha kare
 Lalu fears that seeing the Congress leaders, the public will remember the 2G scam and the BJP will also remind that the Congressmen insulted the great Yaduvanshi saint Baba Ramdev
 
 
 ab lalu kah rahe hai ki ham manch saajha nahin karenge
 On the other hand, Congressmen are also saying the same
 maje kii baat ye he ki congress-lalu kaa gathjod to ho rahaa he, lekin donon jaanate hai ki jahaan congress kaa ummidavaar chunaav ladega, vahaan yadavon kaa vot dol saktaa he or bijepi main ja saktaa he
 The real matter is about Muslim voters, behind which lalu-congress are lying
 is chunaav main agar lalu is sunahare maukey ko siton main tabdeel karne se chuke, to sthiti vaaki unke liye gambhir ho jaaegi

 But nobody ever says that good sex life is also very important in taking it further
 sex life kaa ek bahut mahatvapunar hissaa he
 But many couples are hesitant to do it and some enjoy it thoroughly
 haal hi main hue ek nae shodh ke anusaar main yah baat saamne ai hai ki jonav vivaahit mahilaayein sexka adhik majaa leti hai or isse pataa chalata he ki unka jivan ke bare main bahut utsahit hai

 They were asked to record in the diary whether they had sex every day
 agar kiya to wo ek se saat tak kii ginati main use kitne marks denge
 The results showed that couples had sex on average three to four times over this two-week period
 pichley adhyayanon main paaya gaya tha ki purush mahilaon kii tulana main adhik sex kii ichha rakhte hai or isaki pahal bhi zyada karte hai
 However, contentment is another matter and it cannot be told rightly that those who are happier have sex frequently
 lekin sex sambandhon ko majboot banaata he isamen koi do raay nahin he

 lekin party ne kurba samudaay par daanv lagaaya he
 Yeddyurappa's path will be easy or difficult by removing Maltesh, only time will tell

 But the party declared Maltesh its candidate against Yeddyurappa

 It is believed that the Congress party has made it very easy for Yeddyurappa by removing Maltesh from Shikarpura seat
 maltesh lingayat samudaay se bhi nahin aate hai, wo kurba hai
 In such a situation, the candidate of Kurba community has been fielded against Yeddyurappa from Lingayat dominated seat
 maltesh kurba chalate yediurppa ke saamne pichhadi jatiyon or essi, asti voton ko sadhana mushkil hoga
 Compared to the Congress against Yeddyurappa, the JDS has fielded a strong Lingayat community candidate, HT Baligar
 baligar shikarpura seat jeetne ke puri takat se jute gaye hai
 Yeddyurappa's son Raghavendra is struggling to win his father's assembly

 nai dilli main ol india congress cameti kii baithak main bolte hue unhone upie kii uplabdhiyon se hi baat shuru kii
 But this time, in his speech, more efforts were made to excite the activists
 unki aawaaj roj ke mukaable zyada tej or talkh thi
 Rahul's speech was in two parts
 ek angreji main or doosraa hindi main
 He started speaking in English for the workers who came from South, then spoke in Hindi also
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se congress ko 21veen sadi kii party banane kaa aahvaan kiya
 Rahul sharply criticized the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party, and demanded 12 LPG cylinders instead of 9 from Manmohan Singh, the head of his own government
 jo hindi main bole rahul gandhib main thodaa sa hindi main bolnaa chahta hum
 Our beloved workers
 aapke liye hindi main bolta chahta hum
 Those who have come from South spoke for you in English
 dekhie kai saal pehle rajeev ji ne or yahaan jo bujurg kaaryakarta baithe hai, jo dikh rahe hai
 You talked about taking the country into the 21st century
 or uski neenv aapane rakhi thi
 Now we have to do the same thing in the Congress party
 party ko 21veen sadi main pahunchaana he
 what does it mean
 yahaan kaaryakarta baitha he, jo aapaki aawaaj he, wo party main acchhee tarah joro se sunai de
 When we decide, let your voice be heard
 main aapse miltaa hum, aap kehete ho, chunaav kaa samay aata he
 We work for five years
 chunaav se teen maheene pehle dholak bajnaa shuru hota he
 People come from the other party
 kehete hai, bhaiya hamen chunaav ladaao
 If our worker is fighting
 chunaav koun ladega
 The worker will fight
 'nai peedi ko laana he'main ye nahin kah rahaa hum ki congress party ke daravaaje band karne hai
 It has to be opened
 nai peedi ko andar laana he
 But in the heart of the election that will be fought next, the ideology of the Congress party should be in the mind
 uske khun main congress party kii vichaardhaara honi chahie
 We run the government
 or jab bhi main jaataa hum pradeshon main
 The worker says, see Rahul ji
 hamaari sarkaar he, magar jis prakaar se hamaari sunwaayee honi chahie
 She is not happening
 21veen sadi kii party kaa matlab he, kaaryakarta kii sarkaar main sunwaayee hogi
 We have done three things and very big things
 ab ham kaaryakarta se, aam janata se, enjio se, sabase poochkar menifesto bana rahe hai
 Youths, women
 alpsankhyakon, udyogpatiyon, dalit, adivaasiyon, kisaanon or mazdooron se puuchhenge or jo aap hamen bataaoge, vah menifesto main jayega or vahi sarkaar karke dikhaaegi
 Asking the workers, we will choose the candidate and one step, our workers and leaders will be very happy to hear this, small but very deep step
 loksabhaa ke chunaav main 15 ilaakon main, ham aapke poochkar, kaaryakartaaon or pradhanon se poochkar
 The candidates will directly choose the candidate by asking
 aapse puuchhenge or aapkaa jo faisla hoga, use koi nahin badal saktaa he
 If it succeeds
 agar ye baat congress party ko acchhee lagi, to ham or gahare tareeke se vidhansabha or loksabhaa main karengebhavishya main kya karenge ye bhi bataanaa chahta hum
 i want to tell what is in the heart of the Congress party

 'garibon ko middle class banaaenge 5 saal main'ye koun log hai, ve hai jinke ghar main koi biimaar hota he, to ye phir garibi rekha ke neeche chale jate hai
 They panic for their child's education
 ye poochhate hai, mere bachche ko rojgaar milegaa yaa nahin milegaa
 These people are those who build and run this country

 Painter, security guard, the man who erected this stadium

 You listen well congress party aapaki ladaai ladgaye vaali he

 There is no roof or weak roof above your head

 'I want half the Chief Minister to be women', you know, what the Congress party does when it makes up its mind

 Fifty percent of the female population is there and i want half the room to be full of them
 congress party main jahaan bhi sarkaar he
 In the coming time, 50 percent women will be the Chief Ministers
 upi main maine mahilaon ke saath kaam kiya
 i run an organization
 unhone mujhe bahut baaten sikhain
 a deep thing penetrated my heart
 unhone bataaya dekhie rahul ji
 As long as there is no respect for women in this country, they will not be given power, till then the country cannot stand

 Crimes against children in the country's capital are not being named
 ravivaar ko north west dilli se shalimaar baag thana aria main golf course kii jhaadiyon main 11 saal ke ek bachche kaa shav milane se sansani fail gai
 The police have also arrested the accused, showing readiness
 haalanki north west dilli ke DCP ne jarur is maamle main media se duuri banaae rakhi
 Police have sent the dead body of the child to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital for postmortem and the accused is being questioned
 police pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki aaropee ne bachche kii hatya kyon kii
 Was the accused alone or someone else with him
 haalanki abhi bachche kihatya kii vajah rahasyahi bani hui he
 Police has registered a case against the accused under PASCO
 police ko ashanka he ki aaropee ne bachche ke saath kukarm kiya he
 Police said that the accused lives alone in Delhi and works as a laborer
 police ne bataaya ki baccha shanivaar kii shaam gaayab hua
 The poor family of the deceased child lives in a rented house on the banks of Hyderpur Canal in Shalimar Bagh
 chauthi class main padhane vaala baccha mohalle ke duusare bacchon ke saath ghar se baahar khel rahaa tha
 Then a drunken man asked the child for some goods from the shop
 iske baad usne bachche ko laalach diya ki vah use dukaan se khaane kii kuch chijen dilavaayega
 The child became greedy and started going with that unknown person
 tabhi saath khel rahe duusare bacchon ne bhaag kar uske ghar waalon ko bataaya ki koi ankal uske dost ko le ja rahe hai
 All the people ran but by then the child was missing
 gharavaalon ke lakh dhundne ke baavjood na to baccha mila or na use le jane vaala shaks
 The family kept searching for the child till morning, but no clue of the child was found
 phir parijanon ne police se shikaayat kii
 Police found the accused in the area only on the basis of the second child's description, and soon he was found in an intoxicated state
 police ne jab sakhti se poochtacha kii to usne apnajurm kubul kar liyaor bataaya ki usne bachche kii hatya kar bhalswa deyari ilaake main sthit golf course main jhaadiyon ke peeche uski laash ko phenk diya he
 Actually this golf course ground has a lot of trees and forest
 golf course par kuch guard jarur sarkaar kii taraf se tainaat hai, lekin guard andar hi rahete hai
 Whereas on the shrubs and wooded area, the nearby drunkards and addicts roam around
 isi kaa phayda uthaakar nashedi ne maasoom kii hatya kar aasaani se vahaan phenk chalaa gaya
 Team Anna has criticized the Lokayukta Bill made in Himachal Pradesh
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki himachal pradesh sarkaar ne team anna ke pramukh sadasservind kejarivalse tay kii gayi apni mulaakaat radd kar di
 The state government has decided to cancel the program to meet Kejriwal due to criticism of the Lokayukta Bill enacted in Himachal Pradesh
 kejariwal ne bhaajapa ke bare main kaha tha ki aisa lagata he ki kanoon ke maamle main bhagava party or congress kaa rukh ek jaisaa hi he
 Kejriwal termed Himachal's Lokayukta Bill as 'very weak and ineffective' and also questioned whether by bringing such a bill in the state, the 'strong' bill brought by the bjp-led government in Uttarakhand this year
 Is rejecting yah baat khub charchaa main thi ki gramin sinhal kshetron main raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe ko janvari, 2015 ke pichley raashtrapati chunaavon main beyimaani se haraa diya gaya tha
 Many people believed that the Western powers had hatched a conspiracy to remove Rajapaksa from Sri Lanka's power
 logon ke man main baithi is baat kaa asar dikhataa he ki 10 farvari ko hue sthaneey chunaavon main rajpakshe kii party kii jeet sunishchit ho gai
 While the election results have again brought Rajapaksa to the forefront of the race, the already staggered Naiya of the coalition government has suffered a major setback
 rajpakshe kii party ko kul pade voton kaa kareeb 45 pratishat mila, jabaki srilanka kii sansad main sabase badi, pradhanmantri ranil vikramsinghe kii united neshnal party (yuanpi) kareeb 33 fisadi voton ke saath duusare number par rahi
 President Maithripala Sirisena's party performed poorly
 ve 15 fisadi vot hi juta sake
 Though there is no threat to the Sirisena government due to the defeat in the local elections, people believe that these elections are like a poll of opinion for Sirisena and Wickremesinghe's coalition government
 aagaamee sansadeey chunaavon main janata kaa rukh kya ho saktaa he, is chunaav ne iske sanket de die hai
 Political analyst Dayan Jayatileka wrote, "his political opponents are not as heavy as Mohammed Ali of political politics
 '' haalanki dayaan hameshaa rajpakshe kii tarafdaari karte rahe hai phir bhi ye chunaav parinaam purv raashtrapati kii party ke satta main vaapasi ke sanket dene lage hai jinhone apane kaarykaal main kathor sainya karrwai karke libration tigers of tamil ilam yani littey kaa safaya kar diya tha
 This election result made up about 23 percent of the country's population
 1 karod udaaravaadi sinhalai, tamil or muslim aabaadi ko thodaa maayoos kiya hoga
 Rajapaksa's staunch supporters are mostly Sinhalese Buddhist communities
 vipaksh ke netaa or tamil neshnal elliance ke mukhiya rajavrothium sampanthan ne rajpakshe ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan apanaae sampradayik hatkandon kii bhartsana kii thi
 Rajapaksa had told the people during the election campaign that by voting for the UNP, you will pave the way for the creation of a separate Tamil state
 ve kehete hai, ''yah rajpakshe kaa ek durbhaavnapurna, ghrunit or bhraamak dushprachaar tha
 Rajapaksa was accused of human rights violations, nepotism, fraud and corruption charges and had to relinquish power in 2015
 logon kaa maananaa tha ki rajpakshe or unke bhai milakar ek damankaaree sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 In view of international pressure, rising debt and public outrage over misuse of power, Rajapaksa announced premature presidential elections to strengthen his position
 charchaa se dur rahane vaale rajpakshe sarkaar ke mantri or kareebi sahyogi sirisena ko vipaksh ne rajpakshe ke khilaaf saajha ummidavaar ke rup khadaa kiya
 It took stakes c taken or choose Sirisena President with the support of the Tamil and Muslim voters
 baharhaal, rajpakshe kii paraajay ke baad yuanpi kii sarkaar aapasi vaicharik matbhed kii shikaar ho gai
 The Sirisena-led Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is a left-leaning party that talks of alliances with Russia and China and advancing the non-aligned Movement
 pashchim kii taraf jhukaav rakhane vaali yuanpi ko dakshinpanth vichaardhaara se prerit mana jaataa he
 Sirisena and Wickramasinghe come from opposite backgrounds from each other
 sirisena gramin krishi pradhan polonruva jile se hai to vikramsinghe colombo ke samrudh parivaar se taalluk rakhte hai
 The two had outlined a common program that included bringing back black money stashed abroad by Rajapaksa, tightening corruption, restoring human rights and hearing war crimes charges on the armed forces
 haalanki purvavarti sarkaar ke logon ke khilaaf lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke maamalon main koi safalataa nahin mili or mukademe waapas le liye gaye
 In addition, the Prime Minister, who made his trusted aide the governor of the Central Bank, was accused of sharing confidential information related to the sale of bonds with his son-in-law
 is par sirisena ne ek raashtrapati ayog kaa gathan kiya jiske saamne pradhanmantri ko bataur gavaah upasthit hona padaa tha
 This led to a tussle between Sirisena and UNP members and accused Sirisena of unnecessarily harassing the same party, which tried hard to make him President
 jis vivaadaaspad port city project ko vikramsinghe ne satta main vaapasi ke saath hi band kara dene kaa elaan kiya tha, aaj vah puri gati ke saath aage bad rahaa he or isse rajpakshe kii china kii taraf jhuki nitiyon se chhutkaaraa paane ke vaade ko tilanjali de di gai
 Throughout the election campaign, the bitterness between the two partner parties was palpable
 rajpakshe par nishaanaa saadhane kii bajaae sirisena apane gathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ko hi bhrashtachar ke liye doshi tehraate rahe
 On the other hand, the members of the UNP continued to hold Sirisena as 'a favor'
 is par badhati mahangaai, urvarak par sabsidi main katautee or mantriyon par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ne rahi-sahi kasar puri kar di or rajpakshe ke paksh main maahaul ban gaya
 The constitution of the country does not allow anyone to contest the election of the President more than twice, so Rajapaksa will not be able to contest the election of the President
 abhi ve sansad ke sadsy hai or agar ve bahumat kaa jugad kar paane main safal rahe to pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 There will be presidential elections and parliament elections in 2020
 sirisena or vikramsinghe kii aapasi khinchataan yadi nahin rukii to rajpakshe unke roke, rukenge nahin

 The Indian team will play first three one-day matches and then a series of two Test matches, embodied after many ups and downs
 dakshin africa kii tej or oochaal vaali pichon par khelnaa bharat ke liye hameshaa chunauti bharaa rahaa he or yahi vajah he ki pichley 20 se adhik varshon se vah kabhi vahaan shrunkhlaa nahin jeet paaya
 Of the five Test series India have played in South Africa so far, the host country won four of them while the 2010–11 series was drawn
 bharat ne ab tak dakshin africa sarajameen par 15 test match khele hai jinamein se use do main jeet or saat main haar mili he
 The remaining six matches were drawn
 asal main bharat ko dakshin africa main apni pehali jeet ke liye lanbaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 The Indian team visited South Africa for the first time in November 1992 where they lost 0–1 in four Tests
 iske baad 1996-97 or 2001-02 main dakshin africa ne kramash: 2-0 or 1-0 se jeet darj kii thi
 India then went on a South African tour in 2010–11
 use centurian main pehle test match main pari ke antar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin durban main khele gaye duusare match main lakshmana ke saahasik prayaas se usne 87 ran se jeet darj karke shrunkhlaa 1-1 se baraabar karavaayi thi
 The third match played at Cape Town was a draw
 bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye vartmaan daura bhi har baar kii tarah chunauti bharaa hoga
 Batsmen like Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma will have to ensure that the team is no longer missing Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman, who have shown their batting prowess on South African soil from time to time
 dhoni kii team kii pehali chunauti haalanki teen maichon kii van-de shrunkhlaa hogi, kyonki simit overon kii cricket main bharat kabhi dakshin africa main acha pradarshan nahin kar paaya
 India has managed to win only five of the 25 one-day matches played on South African soil between these two teams so far
 is bich usne 19 match ganvaaye jabaki ek match kaa parinaam nahin niklaa
 Between these two teams, three bilateral series have been played in South Africa so far and in all three, the hosts won by a big margin
 dakshin africa ne 1992-93 main 5-2 se, 2006-07 main 4-0 se or 2010-11 main 3-2 se jeet darj kii thi
 India has thus been able to win only four of the 16 matches in the bilateral ODI series in South Africa and lost 12 of them
 dhoni kii aguwai vaali team abhi lagaataar chah van-de shrunkhalaaon main jeet darj karke dakshin africa daure par ja rahi he or is baar uske liye paas van-de or test shrunkhlaa jeetne kaa sabase badhiya mauka mana ja rahaa he
 Pakistan's win over South Africa in the first two odis will also boost the morale of the Indian team
 ram mandir kaa mudda dhire-dhire garm hota ja rahaa he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is reaching Ayodhya on Saturday
 isse pehle hi saikadon shivasainik vahaan pahunch chuke hai
 It is believed that Shiv Sena wants to surround the BJP from all sides on this issue
 shivasena kaa yah spasht kahana he ki vah ram mandir ke naam par vot nahin maangegi lekin sawaal bhi uth rahe hai ki 1992 ke baad shivasena ko ab bhagwaan ram itani shiddat se kyon yaad aae hai
 The Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992 and Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray came forward and took responsibility for it
 unhone kaha tha ki babari masjid kaa todaa janaa unke liye garv kii baat he
 Today the situation has become such that BJP and Shiv Sena are together but Shiv Sena keeps spewing venom against BJP
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi dikhaane kii koshish hoti he ki donon saath main chunaav nahin ladenge or maharashtra main inkaa gathbandhan tut jayega
 Attempting to put pressure on BJP! Political experts say that the Shiv Sena wants to bring pressure on the backfoot of the BJP by putting pressure on it to compromise the seats with the BJP
 ayodhya main agar uddhav ko acha respons miltaa he to upi main bhi siton ke liye apana daawa pesh kar sakate hai
 In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena once got the post of Chief Minister but today the situation is different
 maharashtra main bijepi kaa mukhyamantri he
 The way the Shiv Sena has become vocal about the Ram temple, it is clear that it is trying to grab the issue of its partner party BJP
 aamtaur par ab tak bijepi hi ram mandir ko mudda banaate rahi he or 2014 main ram mandir ko hi mudda banaakar vah badi jeet hasil kii thi, lekin ab aisa lag rahaa he ki yah mudda shivasena kaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray himself reaching Ayodhya shows that he is not going to leave the BJP on this issue and will continue to challenge him for the temple even while staying with him
 shivasena netaa arvind saavant ne kaha tha ki bijepi ne 2014 main kashmir vivaad, dhara 370 hataane or ayodhya main ramamandir banane kaa vaada kiya tha
 It has been more than four years to the Modi government but the construction has not even started
 yah maamla abhi bhi court main he
 Babri was not taking any responsibility for the demolition of the mosque
 us vakt shivasena ke sansthaapak balasahab thakare ne isaki jimmedaari lee thi
 Balasaheb Thackeray had said - Babri Masjid is a matter of pride, in 1993, after the fall of Babri Masjid, Balasaheb Thackeray had said in an interview that it was a matter of pride, not a shame
 mandir masjid ke neeche tha
 We brought the temple up
 aap itihaas dekhenge to pataa chalegaa, bharat main babar yaa jitne muslim shaasha aae, unhone hamaare saare mandir gira die or masjiden bana deen
 It is our duty to bring down such mosques and bring the temples up
 shivasena ke saansad sanjay raut ne kaha ki hamane 17 minute main babari tod di to kanoon banane main kitna time lagata he? raashtrapati bhawan se lekar upi tak bijepi kii sarkaar he
 There are many mps in the Rajya Sabha who will stand with the Ram temple
 jo virodh karegaa, uskaa desh main ghoomana mushkil hoga
 'government enacted legislation in Parliament: When the Modi government is in the last year of its tenure, the Shiv Sena has often reminded the BJP of its promise
 shivasena bhavy ram mandir banane ke liye sansad main kanoon banane kii maang kar chuki he
 According to Shiv Sena, the Ram temple case in Ayodhya cannot be resolved through the court
 court kaa faisla log nahin maanenge, kyonki yah aasthaa se judaa maamla he
 In such a situation, the central government should enact legislation in Parliament to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ayodhya main ram mandir banane ke liye sansad main kanoon banaae to shivasena sarkaar kaa puraa samarthan karegi

 5 stardiarectorroland emrichakalakaarlaayam hemsworth, jeff goldblam, sharlat gainsburg, bill pulman, maayka munro, travis top or jud harshahollywood bhi kai baar aisi galtiyaan kar detaa he jisaki ummid usase nahin hoti
 In 1996, there was a Independence Day film about aliens attacking the Earth
 film main dikhaae gaye alian atake or usase judi kahani ne sabakaa dil jeet liya tha
 The film did well at the box office and made a mark
 iske nirmaataa bees saal baad iskaa sikval lekar aae hai
 But this sequel disappoints in everything from story to story
 universal soljar (1992), independence de (1996), godjila (1998) or 2012 (2009) jaisi shandaar filmein banane vaale diarector rolland emrich is baar chook gaye hai
 He decided to make a sequel to the film, but he did not have a solid story for the film, and there was no x factor with which he would be able to do anything new about aliens
 or kul milakar ve kaaphi uktau, doharaav se bharaa kamjor sikval lekar aae
 The story is like it has been twenty years since the first Alien attack
 pehle hamale se ubarne ke baad duniya ke sabhi deshon ne milakar arth spes dephence banaaya he or aria51 antariksh suraksha kaa mukhyalay ban chukaa he
 Through the state-of-the-art and technology of aliens, movement in space has become easier and weapons have also changed
 iske saath hi america kii raashtrapati ek mahila ban gai hai
 But in the midst of all this, the world is again facing the threat of aliens
 tarah-tarah ke sanket milane lage hai or scientist jeff goldblam is bare main jaankaree jutaney nikalate hai to unki mulaakaat duusari scientist sharlat gainsburg (antikrist or ninfomeniyak) se hoti he
 Then all that starts in the first part
 aliens puri takat ke saath dharti kii ore lautate hai auki landan or america kii tarah duniya ke kai deshon ke shaharon ko tabah karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Then the same old story begins that was seen in Independence Day
 lekin vah us samay nai thi or alag dhang se kahi gai thi
 Perhaps the director forgot this
 unhone saim tu saim waisi hi kahani piro di, sirf itnaa antar kiya ki kirdaar badal daale
 Everything else remains the same
 puraane tarah ke alian aurakahani menkoi conection point nahin hone kii vajah se maar-dhaad boring lagane lagati he
 Even loose actors like Jeff Goldblum and Charlotte do not make an impact in the film
 bich-bich main yah sochane par bhi majaboor hona padataa he ki itane kamjor plot ke saath film kaa sikval banane kii emrich ko kya jarurat thi
 Overall, the disappointment in every case, from plot to treatment and technology, is disappointing
 ise hi kehete hai, ooncha naam or feekaa kaam

 This is the first time the two leaders appeared in court together in this case
 adaalat main nitin gadakari ne kaha ki kejariwal ko apana bayaan waapas lenaa hoga lekin kejariwal ne isse saaf inkaar kar diya
 The court has asked both of them to end their quarrel as soon as possible
 court kii kaarywahi kaa puraa byorajaj ne gadakari se kahanagar aap chahen to is matbhed ko khatm kar sakate hai
 Both of you are politicians, spend your time in good works
 gadakaringar kejariwal apana bayaan waapas le lete hai to main cese waapas lene ko taiyaar hum
 Judge: Can't you both reconcile? Mr
 Gadkari, you have also won the election
 pooraani baton ko bhul jaaen
 Gadkari: i had made a similar complaint against Manish Tiwari
 unhone maafee maang lee or maine cese waapas le liya
 Actually, i have nothing but my credit
 in aaropon ke kaaran meri chhavi ko dhakka laga he
 i am not even talking about apologizing
 agar kejariwal apana bayaan waapas le lete hai to main cese waapas le luungaa
 The judge told Kejriwal: You came into politics with an agenda
 ye kis chakkar main funs gaye? puri duniya kii najar aap donon par he
 Set an example for everyone
 yah izzat kaa sawaal nahin he
 If you have proof, then do the case
 par media main aise bayaan dene kii kya jarurat?kejarivalsameri nitin gadakari ke saath koi nijee dushmani nahin he
 Gadkari: i do not mind if Kejriwal does not apologize
 main sirf is baat ko lekar phikrmand hum ki vah apana bayaan waapas lete hai yaa nahin
 i respect Kejriwal ji
 lekin rajaneta ke taur par mere paas sammaan ke alaava kuch nahin he
 Kejriwal: i will not take back my statement
 iske baad nitin gadakari ke vakeelon ne court se kaha ki yah bayaan santoshjanak nahin he
 In today's proceedings, the court advised both the leaders not to make it a matter of honor
 donon ko sulah karne ko kaha
 In response to which Gadkari said that this is a matter of honor for him, while Kejriwal said that his fight is against corruption

 Let me tell you that Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time
 is desh main kol machaa he faqat kore bayanon kaa, aaropon ke khel ko siikho, ye khel he bade daam kaa dhandhe maataram
 Piyush Pandey's work defines Dhandhe Mataram business as new
 dhandha hi apni sanjivani he jo mrit praaia main praan phoonk detii he phir dhandha chaahe koi bhi ho
 Those who give big arguments about religion and caste, even when they are promising their respective fields, Vande Mataram is left behind and the business of Mataram wins
 piyush ne ek pagal se mulaakaat ke madhyam se yah spasht kiya he ki dharm-jaat, raashtra-samvidhan, sabko dhandha bana diya he logon ne
 And when you have made a business, then say business, Mataram
 vande maataram bolne kii aukaat nahi he
 "from a to Intolerance, a to Terrorism, Piyush has done a very satire on politics
 raajnneeti ko bhale hi ganda kaha jaae par yah dhandha bada kaamyaab bana detaa he insaan ko
 How to make the opposition stand in the charge and do not let Parliament run
 jhuthe aaropon kaa khandan karne main bhale hi rashtriya mudde puche chhot jaaen par apni raajnneeti kaa dhandha barkaraar rahanaa chahie
 The writer has also prepared a new piece for aspiring politicians
 vyangy ko lekar lekhak kii drushti bilkul alag he
 Piyush has a deep understanding of the concerns of satire
 ek vaakya " achche din aaenge " ko virodhiyon ne kis prakaar uchhaala ki tamaam pragati ko andekha kar diya
 Piyush through a sentence has satirized even if the Hindustani trains do not arrive on time
 achche din aaenge par bhartiya trainon kii tarah kahin bhatak gaye hai
 The mindset of those shouting slogans of democracy and shouting slogans of democracy has been exposed by shouting and shouting that is it really not a murder of democracy? kya dhandhe maataram hi sarvopari he
 Dengue mosquito is a symbol of our sickening mentality
 insaan hi insaan ko das rahaa he or apni is harakat par garvit ho rahaa he
 Piyush has rightly said, "dirty is but a business" Governments keep changing, but the problem of unemployment remains as it is
 kore vaadon se baat nahin banati
 If the youth comes forward in every field, "the serpent dance has to be saved", like the youth will be brought out of desperation and the declaration of political parties will not be limited to fooling the voters
 unhen vaade puure karne hi honge
 Piyush has expressed how easy it is to understand how to make our owl straight
 charchit bane rahane ke liye kya-kya nautanki kerani chahie iskaa bakhubi varnan or vyangyatmak drushtikon pradarshit kiya he
 "holi Kanhaiya Ki 
 
 " samaaj kii visangatiyon ko piyush ne ati sahajata se spasht kiya he
 It is a matter of Piyush's ability to find the subject of satire from everyday events
 chaahe baba hon yaa rajaneta sthiti kamobesh donon kii ek jaisi hi he
 Both specializes in pretending
 ankhon main dhul jhonknaa to inke baayen haath kaa khel he
 How the crowd of devotees takes them from the floor to the hailstones, even if they fall in their faces, they do not mind because they are expert in their business
 aam aadmi hone kaa dard bhi piyush ne ubhaara he
 There are some sensations in the mind that how we get broken even if we are innocent, but do not even raise our eyes towards the upper class despite harsh blows
 dikhaava hamaari rag-rag main he
 If we also donate, then for the sake of showing it, we also put it on youtube
 raajnneeti ek daldal he isamen funsate janaa laazmi he
 a large bungalow and gathering of sycophants is the identity of the people's hero
 kore vaade, nae-nae pralobhan, jinke jaal main fansata aad aadmi use kya miltaa he vahi dhak ke teen paat
 Piyush's composition shakes the mind, makes us aware of the truth of the country and society
 dhandha hi hamaare liye sarvopari he chaahe vah kaisaa bhi kyon naa ho
 The politics of protest is gaining momentum
 virodh nahin to raajnneeti kis baat kii
 Whether it is about cleanliness campaign or property details
 har acchhee baat kaa virodh karnaa hamaara janm siddh adhikaar he
 We are addicted to arbitrariness
 chunaav ke pehle ghoshnaptr main bade-bade vaade hote hai garib kii jarurat puure karne ke par garib vahiin rah jaataa he or rajaneta or amir ho jate hai
 This is the irony of the country
 piyush ko unke vyangy sangrah dhandhe maataram ke liye shubhakamanaayen, padhate hi pathakon ke man main sawaal uthenge or samaaj tathaa desh kii paristhiti chalchitr kii bhaanti unke nainon ke saamne ghumengi aisa meraa vishwaas he
 There are many serious subjects in the collection on which Piyush's writings are satirical
 bhashaa aam he isliye prabhaavshaalee he
 The public outrage has also emerged, but in a smooth and sarcastic form
 piyush kaa sangrah nishchay hi saamaajik sarokaaron par sochane ko vivash karegaa
 Book Name - Dhandhe Mataramakhalak - Piyush Pandeprakash - Prabhat Publication Price - 250 aakhirkaar sabase lambe chalane vaale big bos ke sijan 8 kaa ant 31 janvari ko ho jayega

 Ali Quli Mirza: As a wild card entry, he stepped into Bigg Boss house and entertained everyone by showing various forms
 ali ke liye sabase buree baat ye he ki aaj tak kisi bhi wild card entry ko big bos kaa vijeta banate nahin dekha gaya he
 Now will this practice continue this time, or will it change? Dimpy Mahajan: Dimpy, whose voice has been spread all around, sometimes crying loudly in the battles and sometimes getting the support of the people

 Gautam Gulati: Gautam Gulati whom Farah Khan named 'gullu' has become very popular in Bigg Boss house for his body as well as acting
 atakalon ke hisaab se shaayad big bos ke vinar banane ke sabase bade pratiyogi hai

 lekin aisa dekha gaya he ki pichley sijan main jo sabase shaktishaalee pratiyogi rahaa he, use vijeta kaa khitaab milte-milte rah gaya he
 Now will Gautam become the winner or will history be repeated again
 phinale kii raat to pataa chal hi jayega

 com / xpq89f2p0u Rebel MLA from Delhi's Timarpur Pankaj Pushkar once again targeted the Kejriwal government
 dilli vidhansabha kaa 2 dinon kaa satr bulaayaa gaya, jisko lekar apni hi party par sawaal uthaae gaye
 Pankaj Pushkar said that the assembly session is used only for the preparation of municipal elections
 jahaan prashnkaal se zyaadavidhansabhako aarope or pratyarope karne kaa akhaada bana diya jaataa he
 This time also, on 17 January, the question hour was only 20 minutes
 jabaki nagar nigam ko lekar charchaa 2 ghante chali or dilli kii janata ko footbal bana diya
 He said that the session is called on 2 days notice
 vibhageeya adhikariyon ko prashn ke uttar taiyaar karne ke liye 3 din kaa samay miltaa he
 The answers to the questions are half-baked, ambiguous and confusing
 vidhansabha main jhooth bolaa jaataa he, sach chupaaya jaataa he
 The Question Hour, which is a tool to establish the supremacy of the legislature, has been converted into Khanapurti
 do varsh main aise 5 maukey bhi nahin aae honge jabadilli vidhansabhaamein paryaapt avadhi kaa prashnkaal rakhaa gaya ho
 It is noteworthy that the Question Hour is the occasion when the Cabinet has to answer the questions of the people's representatives essentially
 dilli vidhansabha kaa anubhav he ki dilli sarkaar apane mantrimandal ko aise bachaakar chalati he jaise ki ve doodhpite bachche hon
 This is the reason why there are no question hours and even if they are half-done

 Another revelation has been made in the case of the death of journalist Jamal Khashogi at the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul
 turki ke ek akhbaar ne shanivaar ko daawa kiya ki khashogi ke hatyaron ne unke shav par tejaab daalane ke baad avasheshon ko naale main daal diya
 The Turkish president said on Saturday that recordings of journalist Jamal Khashogi's assassination last month have been shared with Saudi Arabia, the US and other countries
 haalanki adhikariyon ne bataaya ki koi bhi likhit dastavej saajha nahin kiya gaya he
 Significantly, Kikhshogiko was last seen going to the consulate on 2 October to obtain documents for her marriage
 patrkaar jamaal khashogi kii hatya ke maamle main kai baar inkaar karne ke baad saudi arab ne aakhirkaar sweekaar kiya ki 59 varshiya patrkaar kii hatya ho gai thi
 According to Khashogi's cremation agency language, some officials have pointed to Shahzada Mohammed bin Salman for the incident
 haalanki hatya ke maheene bhar baad bhi khashogi ke shav kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he
 Meanwhile, a Turkish newspaper claimed that Khashogi's killers dumped his remains in the drain after he was impregnated on his body

 Let me tell you that earlier a top prosecutor of Turkey said that he was strangled to death as he entered the embassy
 itnaa hi nahin, unke shav ko thikaane lagane se pehle sharir ke tukade-tukade kiye gaye the
 He said that all this was done in a planned manner

 The statement was the first public confirmation by a Turkish official that Khashoggi had been strangled and his body torn to pieces
 turki kaa aarope he ki saudi arab ke shahjade mohammad bin salmaan ke karibiyon ne patrkaar kii hatya kii thi or baad main us par pardaa daalane kii koshish kii

 agar koi mujhase puche ki maine shaadishuda hone ke baavjood kisi or se kyun sambandh banaaya to iskaa thik-thik uttar mere paas bhi nahin he
 Our marriage had been not one or two but seven years
 ham donon bahut khush the
 That was all between us, on which people decorate their dreams
 rishte main ham dono khush the
 They were strong both personally and professionally
 main ek IT kansaltent tha or meri patni public relation kii ek bahut badi company main kaam karti thi
 Work pressure increased and both of us reduced the quality time spent together
 mujhe kaam ke silsile main mujhe kahin or janaa padaa
 Everything went well for some time but after some time i started feeling lonely
 main kariyar main aage bad rahaa tha or apni uplabdhiyon kaa jashn kisi apane ke saath manaanaa chahta tha
 But my wife also had her professional restrictions
 tanhai dhire-dhire ghar karne lagi or main bahut akelaa mahasoos karne laga
 But to say that i have no cousin in this would be wrong
 duniya main kai or log hai jo is daur se guzarate hai lekin ve to aisa nahin karte
 To tell the truth, i started thinking that i should find someone else somewhere
 kisi nae saathi se milanaa or flert karne kaa meraa bahut man hone laga
 Eventually, i started talking to an office girl
 shuru main to sabakuch thik-thik laga
 But gradually our proximity began to grow

 Then the holidays started with weeks and then months

 Things went wrong and they got divorced
 'jab maine apane pati ke phone main unki eks garlfriend kii tasviir dekhi'is baat ko paanch saal ho gaye hai
 Today when i look back, i find that i was a coward
 maine pareshaaniyon se ladke bajaay bhaagna behatar samajha
 Increasing attraction towards someone else is normal when distance from your partner, but your personality is tested on these parameters
 aaj khud se nazar milaane kii himmat nahin hoti he
 i had a good family, a good wife, but i showed senselessness and lost everything in one stroke
 aaj main khud ko is bhari duniya main akelaa paata hum, ajanabiyon se ghira hua
 The mountain of loneliness is getting heavier every day
 maine ek khushhaal parivaar kaa hissaa hone kaa mauka ganvaa diya he

 kalakaar: pulakit samraat, varun sharma, richa chaddha, manjot singh or ali faijal
 Director: Mrigdeep Singh Lamba
 bollywood main yaari dosti ko lekar jab kuch kiya jaataa he, to vah thodi halchal to paidaa karata he
 Whether it is 'delhi Belly' or the more recent 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani'
 ' vaise bhi is kaam main farhaan akhtar ke production house ko maharath hasil he
 Films based on the story of friends, 'dil Chahta Hai' and 'zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' have also produced these, and now 'fukrey' too
 film ekadam dilli vaale andaaj kii he, jaiseh agar tu mujhase friendship karegi to kanni de diyo or bholi chidiya nahin chil he, coffeen kii aakhri keel he
 'fukrey' is the story of the soon-to-be money-making friends, who laugh fiercely but the ending is a bit drawn out, which bothers them, the rest of the film seems to be very attentive if we say it in Delhi
 kahani main kitna dam'phukare' nai peedi ke un yuvaaon kii kahani he, jo apane khwaabon ko shortkat ke jariye puraa karne kii hasarat rakhte hai
 Story of four tilangas
 ek chuuchaa (varun sharma) he jise khwab aate hai
 The job of interpreting his dreams is that of Hanny (pulkit Sharma)
 inke do dost hai laali (manjot singh) or jafar (ali jafar)
 a dream
 uskaa interpretesan or phir use puraa karne ke liye khoonkhaar bholi punjaban (richa chaddha) kii sharan
 After this, the whole mess starts
 film kii kahani kasaavat bhari he, timming jabardast he
 Jugaad to get more number in exam, jugaad to earn more money
 
 
 yani har kaam main dilli style jugad yani 'phukare' main yuvaaon or kamedi pasand karne waalon ke liye har masala he
 Star Appeal: The film does not rest on the shoulders of big stars, but it rests on the big work of small stars
 kahani main dam he, ant main thodaa khinchaav he, jo tang karata he
 Here is the hero script
 film main manjot singh or richa chaddha kii acting jabardast he
 Richa looks good richa chaddha ne dikhaa diya he ki ve bollywood main dhamal karne kii kuwvat rakhti hai
 Manjot's dialogue delivery is amazing
 hanni, chuuchaa, laali or jafar aise kairactor hai, jo adhiktar gali-mohalle main dekhne ko mil jaaenge
 Mrigdeep Singh Lamba in 'teen The Bhai' who could not do miracles, this time he has managed to make the audience laugh in 'fukrey'
 kamai kii baat'dely baili' kaa mujic dene vaale ram sanpat ne 'phukare' kaa sangeet bhi diya he
 Phuk Phuk Phukre, Ambarsaria and Jugaad are great songs
 'dely baili' ke baad 'phukare' aisi film he jisamen dilli ko behtareen dhang se pesh kiya gaya he
 The one liners of the film are awesome

 america ne teen bade aatankiyon kii sabhi sampatti ko jabt karne kaa aadesh de diya he
 The US Treasury Office has ordered the confiscation of the assets of Rahman Fakir Mohammed of South Asia, Astam Khan and Dilawar Khan of Hizbul
 america ne in sabhi aatankiyon ko global aatanki ghoshit kiya he
 Apart from blocking their assets, any organization related to them has been banned
 america kaa trevori department lagaataar aatankwaad kaa samarthan karne vaale sanghathanon par apni karrwai tej kar rahaa he
 If the department believes, they aim to eliminate all those organizations which are helping al-qaeda, lashkar-e-taiba, Taliban and other terrorist organizations
 department ne kaha he ki aatankwaad kii funding ko khatm karne ke liye america lagaataar kadam uthaa rahaa he
 We also appeal to the Pakistani government to take strong action against the terrorists
 teenon par lashkar ke liye fund jutaney kaa aaropain teenon aatankiyon par lashkar-e-taiyaba ke liye fund ikattha karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he, jiske baad america or sayukt raashtra kii taraf se inhen global aatanki ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 All three terrorists live in Pakistan
 gauratlab he ki america kii taraf se pakistan or vahaan ke aatanki sanghathanon par kadi karrwai kii ja rahi he
 Apart from this, on New Year, US President Donald Trump had attacked Pakistan strongly for not taking action against terrorist organizations
 unhone twit kiya tha ki pichley 15 varshon main america ne moorkhtaapurvak pakistan ko 33 arab dollar se zyada kii aarthik madad di, lekin pakistan ne iske jawaab main jhooth or dhokhaa ke sivaay kuch nahin diya
 He considers our leaders foolish
 usne un aatankiyon ko surakshit panaah diya, jinke khilaaf afghanistan main ham abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai

 Daljit Kaur's journey to the first elimination of Bigg Boss house ends in the show
 dalajit ke sho se nikalne par phans behad shocked main hai
 Seeing the journey of Daljit on the show, everyone felt that Daljit would go far ahead in the show, but firstly Daljit himself is quite surprised with the fans when he is homeless
 big bos ke ghar main bilkul fere game khilne ke baavjood dalajit ko sho se baahar aana padaa he
 At the end of Bigg Boss 'journey, Daljit said in an interview,' Bigg Boss is a lifetime experience
 ye aapaki mental strength kaa ek test he
 On getting out of the house first, i myself am quite shocked
 lekin maine kuch bhi phek karne kii koshish nahin kii
 i have been quite honest at home

Let us know that the fans are very disappointed with Daljit being eliminated from Bigg Boss house
 phans kaa maananaa he ki big bos ke ghar se dalajit kaa nikalnaa behad anfere he
 Some believe that Shahnaz Kaur should have been homeless from home instead of Daljeet
 vahiin, kuch logon kaa kahana he ki dalajit kii jagah koyna ko bhi ghar se nikaala ja saktaa tha
 Actually, Daljit's journey to Bigg Boss house has been very good
 2 hafton kii jarney main dalajit ko naa to kisi se budtamiji karte hue dekha gaya or naa hi kisi se jabardastee ladaai karte hue
 Daljit has played his game in Bigg Boss with plenty of grace
 khud salmaan khan ne bhi dalajit ko ghar se avict karte hue sho main unki jarney kii kaaphi saraahna kii thi
 The way Daljeet has put his personality in front of Bigg Boss house, fans have liked him a lot
 yahi vajah he ki sho se sabase pehle dalajit ke ghar se beghar hone se phans kaaphi niraash hai or soshal media par apni naaraazgi jaahir kar rahe hai

 *** samaaj seva main lage hone kii vajah se jane-maane kaarobaari or samajasevi bajranglal bokadiya ke makaan main aksar logon kaa aana-janaa laga rahata tha lekin somvaar kii subah jab tak ek padosi ne unke is ghar main dastak di, tab tak bokadiya sahab kaa katl ho chukaa tha
 This 65-year-old businessman was murdered by slayer by entering his house
 lekin makaan main katl kii iklauti vaardaat nahin thi balki bokadiya ke saath yahaan teen or laashen padi thim or maranevaale baaki log the bokadiya ke driver or do naukar
 All the wounds on all the dead bodies were pointing to the fact that they were all killed by strangulation
 bokadiya kii laash jahaan unke dining teble kii kursi par baithi hui haalat main mili, vahiin baaki ke teen logon kii laash drawing or dining spes main bikhri padi thim
 Both of Bokadia's hands were tied to the chair
 katl ke baad maukey par pahunchi police ne paaya ki unke ghar kaa sadar darwaja tutaa hua he, jabaki ghar kii tamaam chijen bikhri padi hai
 Bokadia's family consists of a son and a daughter, besides his wife, who was married and a few days ago, other people of the house had gone to Mumbai for some work, but before they returned, Bokadia Sahab was killed
 
 darasal, subah unke ghar pahunche ek padosi ko jab kai baar door bel bajaane or awaz lagane ke baavjood andar se koi jawaab nahin mila, to usne kuch duusare logon ko isaki khabar di lekin tamaam padosiyon kii koshish ke baavjood jab bokadiya nivas kaa daravaaza nahin khulaa, to logon ne phir police ko bulaanaa hi thik samajha
 The police had reached the spot
 ghar kaa darwaja kholaa gaya, lekin andar kaa manjar dekh kar kuch der ke liye vardiwaalon kaa bhi dimag gum gaya
 The bodies of four people were lying in the drawing-dining room of the house together
 bujurg bokadiya sahab kii laash jahaan kursi se bandhi hui thi, vahiin unke driver or do naukaron kii laashen neeche padi thim
 The entire house was scattered and the Sadar Darwaza was broken, indicating that the motive for the incident could also be looting
 haalanki mumkin ye bhi tha ki qaatilon ne kisi or makasad se is vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad police ko uljhane ke liye ghar kii chizein bikher deen hon yaa phir kisi khaas cheez kii talash main hi unhone bokadiya ke makaan par dhaava bolaa ho
 The highly accommodating and cheerful Bokadia used to do plastics business and a lot of his time was spent helping people
 ravivaar shaam ko takreeban saadhe paanch baje unke bhai ne unase baat karne ke liye unke mobile phone par kol kiya tha, lekin tab unhone phone nahin uthaaya
 After this, his brother called him again around 11 o'clock at night, but still did not pick up the phone, while Bokadia would never call again
 unke bhai ko tabhi se unki phikr to jarur shuru ho gai thi, lekin bhai ne unke bare main itnaa bura bhi nahin sochaa tha
 By the way, this incident of killing four people together is quite mysterious in itself because Bokadia's house is on the main road and the police picket is right in front of the house
 aksar pulisavaale bokadiya ke ghar se kursi lekar hi picket main paharaa bhi dete hai
 Also, due to having two or two banks nearby, the police are more vigilant at this place anyway, but in spite of this, four incidents of simultaneous murder in such a place are shocking
 jaahir he, yun galaa ret kar ek saath chaar logon kii jaan lenaa koi do-chaar logon kaa kaam nahin ho saktaa, balki is vaardaat main kam se kam 8-10 logon zarur shaamil rahe honge
 The broken door of the house's door indicates that all of these people forcibly entered the house, but despite this, neither did anyone see the killers coming here nor did anyone see this incident during the murder
 It got inking and it is sure to confuse everything
