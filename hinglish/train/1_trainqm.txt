 shriprakash jaiswal ne kaha ki jahaan takschinako bharat ratna dene kaa sawaal he, to us sambandh main vichaar kiya ja rahaa he or uske liye abhi bahut samay shesh he
 Kanpur MP Jaiswal was speaking at a press conference
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya congress ne sachin ko rajyasabha sadsy party kii janata ke bich kharaab hoti sthiti ko dekhte huye banaaya he, to unhone kaha ki sachin ko rajyasabha sadsy banaaye jane ke peeche koi bhi raajnneeti nahin he, vah desh ke ek mahaan khilaadi he or unhen rajyasabha sadsy banaakar party ne unka sammaan kiya he
 He said that since the Congress has hit a master stroke in this case, some political parties are not digesting this and are beginning to have stomach ache
 sachin ko saansad banaaye jane se maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ko phayda pahunchane ke sawaal par, unhone kaha ki sachin ko rajyasabha main manonith karne ke peeche party ne kisi phayda yaa nuksaan ke bare main nahin sochaa he, balki desh kii ek pratibha ko uske kaaryon ke liye sammaan diya he
 For this, all the people should thank Congress President Sonia Gandhi that they have given this honor to Sachin
 kendriya mantri jaiswal se poocha gaya ki sachin ko maharashtra chunaav ke thik pehle rajyasabha main kyon bheja gaya he, to unhone kaha ki agar kuch samay pehle unhen rajyasabha main shaamil kiya jaataa to media yah kahata ki unhen uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke madadenjar party main shaamil kiya gaya he or agar kuch samay baad saansad banaaya jaataa to aap hi log kehete ki sachin ko isaliye rajyasabha main bheja gaya he, kyonki loksabhaa ke chunaav aane vaale hai or usee ke madadenjar unhen saansad banaaya gaya he
 a good sportsman has been honored for increasing the prestige of his country, media or other political parties should not do politics in it
 unhone kaha ki sachin koi congress party main shaamil thode hi ho gayi hai, jo unke aane ke raajnneetik phaayde yaa nuksaan ke bare main sochaa jaae athwa yah dekha jaae ki iskaa asar maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav par padegaa yaa nahin
 Union Minister Jaiswal was asked that instead of being made a member of the Rajya Sabha, Sachin should be given the Bharat Ratna, then he said when Sachin was denied Bharat Ratna
 jab uchit samay aayega tab unhen bharat ratna se bhi sammanit kiya jayega
 He said that Bharat Ratna is the highest honor of the country and its decision is made by a committee
 jab samiti sachin ko bharat ratna dene kaa uchit samay dekhegi, unhen bharat ratna de diya jayega, log thodaa dhary rakhen

 There is no delay
 tareekhen aage peeche hoti rahati hai
 He said that it happened during the Congress era
 congress khamkha bebuniyaad aarope laga rahi he
 The CCPA decides the dates of the session of the Parliament
 sisipie kii baithak abhi hui nahin he, lekin jaldi hi sisipie kii baithak hogi or sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr hoga
 Arjun Meghwal says that we are not running away from discussing any issue
 sansad kashitkaaleen satrajise hi hoga, ham log har mudde par bahes karne ko taiyaar hai or charchaa karne ko taiyaar hai
 On the allegations of Sonia Gandhi, Meghwal says that no corruption case has come up in this government nor can any question be raised
 karpshan ko lekar jiro tolerance he
 So there is no point in these things
 har mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyatorjun meghavaal kaa kahana he ki aisa kuch nahin he ki ham jaanboojhkar deree kar rahe hai
 The CCPA Committee remains (cabinet Committee on Parliament)
 yah cameti tay karti he ki isaki date kya hogi
 As far as the matter of back and forth debt is concerned, it has been happening in the Congress rule too
 tab bhi date aage peeche hote rahe hai
 This means that even then a leader must have set a date
 jaisaa ki ab sonia aarope laga rahi hai ki netaa nahin bula rahe hai
 It's not like this
 sisipie kii baithak hone do, jo mudde ko uthaanaa chaahate hai, vah saare mudde uthaane ke liye swatantra honge
 We will be ready for discussion
 sisipie tay karegi datesansadeey rajyamantri meghavaal kaa kahana he ki sisipie ek alag institution he
 It has the people of the government, the Ministry is also ours, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs also has it
 logon se bich main baat kii jaati he ki unako date suut kar rahi he yaa nahin
 Meghwal said that keeping in view of so many things, the CCPA meets and a session is called
 pehle bhi congress ne aise badlaav kiye hai, paramparaayen rahi he
 According to that, the CCPA does
 arjuna meghavaal kaa kahana he ki jo congress bhrashtachar main dubi hui he, ab vah karpshan kii baat karne lag gai he
 Whereas our government makes it a priority that corruption should not happen under any circumstances
 charchaa karne ke lieshitkaaleen satrane vaala he
 Date is about to be set
 ye jaldi hi hoga

 saudi arab kii tel company aramko kii do badi rifineriyon par yaman ke hooti vidrohiyon ne drone se hamalaa kar diya, jiske baad donon jagahon par tel utpaadan thap ho gaya
 Aramco is the world's largest oil company
 in donon jagahon par band hua utpaadan aramko ke kul utpaadan kaa 50 fisadi or vaishvik utpaadan kaa 5 fisadi he
 After this news, the impact of the deepening crisis on the supply of crude oil was seen in the market on Monday
 kachche tel main ubalbrient crude kii keemat ek second main 12 dollar prati bairal tak uchhal gai
 At 12 noon, Brent was trading at $ 66 a barrel with a gain of over 10 per cent
 vaishvik bazaar kii teji kaa asar bhartiya bazaar par bhi dikhaa
 Crude oil jumped 10 per cent to Rs 4,300 per barrel on the Multi Commodity Exchange
 yah farvari, 2016 ke baad ab tak kii sabase badi ekadini teji he
 Anticipating the uptrend, Ajay Kedia, head of Kakedia Commodity, says, "there were signs of a return to crude oil even before the attack on Aramco's refinery
 ’ america or china ke bich chhide trade war ko donon desh sulajhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This is a direct indication of China extending the tariff date
 aisa hone par kachche tel kii maang main teji kaa hona swaabhaavik he
 Kedia further adds, "apart from this, the demand for petrol and diesel is expected to show improvement in the business activities in the country after the rains
 america main bhi sardiyaan shuru hone ke baad maang ko bal milegaa
 That is, before this attack on Aramco, many domestic and global signs were indicating that the demand for crude oil is going to increase
 ab aramko par hamale ke baad kachche tel kii aapurti par asar padegaa, jisase keemton main teji dekhne ko milegi
 "by the end of September, crude oil can show levels of up to $ 80 per barrel," admits Kedia
 ’’ yah str pichley saal sitambar main bana upree str he
 That is, the story of September last year will also see crude oil prices repeating
 kachche tel kii keemton main yah teji bharat ke liye buree khabar ho sakati he, jo sarkaar se sadak par chalane vaale aam aadmi tak ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban sakati he
 However, oil supplies have been allowed from the strategic reserve to prevent oil supply from the US President Donald Trump

 Until now, the leaders of the main opposition party had been avoiding harsh comments and had confined themselves to the demand to declare the devastation a national disaster
 is mudde par centre kii upie sarkaar ko bhi aade haathon lete hue sushamaa ne kaha he ‘durbhaagya se dilli main sarkaar bhi apekshit netritv dene main naakaam rahi he
 The BJP leader also said that his party leaders are avoiding going to Uttarakhand so that relief and rescue operations are not affected there
 bijepi kii taraf se gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi uttarakhand kaa daura karne vaale ekmaatr bade netaa hai
 Sushma said that 'we did not go to Uttarakhand because the Home Minister has said in a public statement that our visit will affect the rescue operation

 The BJP leader said "the truth is that i had told you about the seriousness of the tragedy only on June 18 when i spoke to the Home Minister and tweeted about it
" ’ sushamaa ne kaha ki anya dal jab centre ko uski khamiyaan bataate hai to vah un par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope laga kar bachane kii koshish karata he
 But the opposition will not allow him to do so
 unhone kaha ‘jab ham javabdehi tay karte hai to aap ise raajnneeti kehete hai
 We will not let you take this path to hide your mistakes
 ’ sushamaa ne kaha ki sarkaar ne kuch nahin kiya he
 All rescue operations were carried out by the Army, Air Force and ITBP putting their lives in danger
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki vah raksha evam ardhsainik balon ke prayaason kii saraahna karti hai
 He said 'what has your state government done? nothing

 unhone bataaya, ‘grih mantralay se anumati milane ke baad prashnawali ko dak or i-mail, donon se musharraf ko bheja jayega

 For the first time after 16 years, actor Aamir Khan not only attended the award ceremony but also received the award
 darasal bharataratna lata mangeshkar ke parivaar dwaara sanchalit 75wein deenanath mangeshkar puraskaar ke liye aamir khan ko unki film 'dangal' ke liye chunaa gaya
 It was also interesting to see Aamir Khan receiving the award at the hands of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat as Aamir Khan faced a lot of opposition in 2015 over wife Kiran Rao's statement that she left the country stating an atmosphere of fear over the issue of intolerance
 lata mangeshkar ke kehane par aae aamir khan lambey samay se aword function kaa bycott karte rahe hai
 This is the reason why many of his films for which he should have received the award did not come in his favor
 isse pehle aamir auskar seremani main najar aae the jab film 'lagaan' ke liye wo academy aword seremani main shaamil hue the
 But this time Aamir broke his vow for Lata Mangeshkar
 aamir khan ke saath vaijayanti maala or kapil dev ko bhi sammanit kiya gaya
 The comments aamir khan ke alaava diggaj cricketer kapil dev ko cricket jagat main unke mahatvapurn yogadan ke liye or apane jamaane kii mashhoor abhinetri vaijayanti maala ko hindi film industry main unki vishesh uplabdhi ke liye master deenanath mangeshkar aword se sammanit kiya gaya
 Both these stars were also awarded by RSS Chief

 Aamir Khan, who came at the behest of Lata Mangeshkar, has been boycotting the award function for a long time
 yahi vajah he ki unki kai aisi filmein jinke liye unako aword milane chahie the, wo unke haq main nahin aae
 Earlier, Aamir was seen in Oscar Ceremony when he joined the Academy Award Ceremony for the film 'lagaan'
 lekin is baar aamir ne lata mangeshkar ke liye apni pratigya tod di
 Vayjayanti Mala and Kapil Dev were also honored along with Aamir Khan
 tippaniyan Apart from Aamir Khan, veteran cricketer Kapil Dev was awarded the Master Dinanath Mangeshkar Award for his significant contribution to the cricket world and his famous actress Vyjayanti Mala for his special achievement in the Hindi film industry
 in donon sitaron ko bhi RSS chif ne aword diya

 unhone apane guru gunratn surishwaraji maharaj se ek bhavy kaarykram main diksha lee
 His entire family and big industrialists like Gautam Adani were also present on the occasion
 mulat: rajasthan ke rahane vaale bhanvaralaal doshi ne kadi mehnat se dilli main apana plastic or usase judi vastuon kaa bada kaarobaar viksit kiya tha or pahanane se lekar film dekhne tak ke shaukeen rahe

 For the last about 3-4 years, there was a discussion in this regard in the family and their sons used to try to take them to another route every time
 lekin pichley saal navambar maheene main unhone ye ghoshnaa kar di ki wo sanyas le lenge
 His Guru could not come to Delhi, so he chose Ahmedabad to take initiation because here too many people associated with Jainism live

 haalanki ek charchaa ye bhi rahi kii jab sadhu ban rahe hai to karodon kaa kharchaa kar dikhaava kyon? Originally from Rajasthan, Bhanwarlal Doshi had developed a large business of plastic and related items in Delhi with hard work and was fond of wearing clothes and watching films
 unke apane bachche bhi hai
 His wife Madhu Ben says that he has always met the saints associated with the society and for some time there was a strong desire to retire
 pichley kareeb 3-4 saalon se parivaar main is sambandh main charchaa ho rahi thi or unke bete har baar unhen bahala phusla kar duusare raste par le jane kii koshish karte the
 But in November last year, he announced that he will retire
 unke guru dilli nahin aa sakate the isliye unhone hi diksha lene ke liye ahmedabad chunaa kyonki yahaan par bhi jain dharm se jude bahut se log rahete hai
 And for three days, grand events were held in Ahmedabad
 karodon kharch karke ek jahaaj banaaya gaya tha jiskaa naam bhi sanyam jahaaj rakhaa tha
 On this, different processions were carried out for three days and in the presence of 1 lakh people in this pandal on Sunday, he retired and named him Bhavanratna Vijay from Bhanwarlal Doshi
 tippaniyan It was a time of great dilemma for the family
 ek taraf itane log unki jai jayakaar kar rahe the or unke pita unase dur ho rahe the
 Even after retiring, his wife met him, but he says that even for a moment he did not feel any sense of family towards him

 ” Ravish Pal Singh, Delhi @reporterravish South Delhi Mayor Kamaljit Sehrawat has accused the Delhi government of doing politics on the matter of 351 roads notifications
 is bare main kuch aankade south emsidi ke netaaon ne aaj saamne rakhe
 Mayor of South Delhi, Kamaljit Sehrawat and Standing Committee Chairman Bhupendra Gupta, accused the Delhi government that the Delhi government is delaying issuing notification as commercial / mixed use of 351 roads and wants to take political advantage by hanging the issue
 
 saharaavat ne kaha ki jis tarah nigam dwaara kiye gaye survey or nigam dwaara paarit prastaav ke saath dilli sarkaar ko 2183 sadakon kii adhisuchana jari karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha or sarkaar ne 10 din ke bheetar 15 sitambar 2006 ko bina koi shart lagaae adhisuchana jari kar di thi
 Similarly, notification of 351 roads should also be issued
 anya 355 sadakon kii adhisuchana bina kisi shart ke 12 april 2007 ko dilli sarkaar ne jari kar di thi
 This notification was also done on the basis of the resolution passed by the corporation
 mahayor ne kaha ki 351 sadakon ke bare main 2007 main nigam dwaara prastaav paarit kiye jane or dilli sarkaar ko bheje jane ke baad 10 saal main bhi adhisuchana jari nahin kii gai
 Sehrawat said that why did the Delhi government not object, considering sending the proposal first? He alleged that why the Delhi government is not following the procedure being adopted earlier in issuing such notification, while it is clear in the proposal of the corporation that it has conducted the survey and earlier within 90 days to issue the notification of roads No such questions were raised
 dilli sarkaar kaa ek maatr kaary he ki 351 sadakon kii adhisuchana jari karen
 It seems that the Delhi government is deliberately delaying issuing notification
 aam aadmi party apane phaayde ke liye ceiling ke halaaton kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 Standing Committee Chairman Bhupendra Gupta accused the Delhi government that while misleading the traders, the Delhi government wanted to tell that the MCD was responsible for the current situation, while the MCD sent the resolution passed in the House in 2007 and 2009 to the Delhi government

 rajasthan ke rajsamand main lav jehad ke naam par ek muslim shramik kii hatya karne video banane vaala shambhulaal raigar phir se surkhiyon main he
 Shambhulal, who is lodged in Jodhpur Central Jail, has released two new hate videos from inside the jail
 jail ke andar video banane ko lekar jail prashasan par to sawaal uth hi rahe hai, lekin donon video dekhakar kuch ahm sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 Both videos seem to be shot in two different places
 inamen se ek video toilet ke andar shoot kiya lag rahaa he
 It is clear that Shambhulal was transported from outside to a mobile, from which these videos were shot
 lekin donon videos dekhakar saaf lag rahaa he ki shanbhu likhaa hua sandesh pard rahaa he
 Now the biggest question has arisen as to how these messages were sent to Shambhulal
 shambhulaal ne kaagaj par yah sandesh khud likhe yaa video shoot karne ke liye mobile bhejne vaale logon ne hi use yah sandesh bhi bheja
 Is any organization behind this or is it someone's personal involvement
 pehle video main shambhulaal vande maataram, 'jai shri ram' or 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naaron ke saath apni baat shuru karata he
 In this video of two minutes 25 seconds, Shambhu Lal tells about the danger of his life in prison for one minute and 10 seconds of the beginning
 is dauraan to shambhulaal mobile ke camere main dekhte hue apni baat kahata he
 But after this, his eyes are set on a written text saying hateful things related to religion, love jihad, Pakistan, Bangladesh and hindu-muslim
 vah jis tarah atak-atak kar lambey-lambey or kathin shabdon se bhare vaakyon ko bol rahaa he, vah saaf ishaara kar rahe hai ki vah likhaa hua sandesh pard rahaa he
 Not only this, when the second video shot from another location starts, Shambhulal seems to repeat the same thing from the previous video
 is duusare video main shambhulaal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye 'saakshaat avtari mahapurush' kaa sambodhan istemaal kiya he
 In this second video, Shambhulal seems to be reading something to the right of the camera's eye
 baar-baar vah bain or kanakhiyon se takata he or apni baat bolta he
 In both videos, Shambhulal is wearing a black hooded jacket and saffron colored t-shirt
 usne kaan main safed rang kaa yearphone laga rakhaa he or chashme main he
 In the second video of 6 minutes 18 seconds, at 2 minutes 35 seconds, there is a sound of ejaculation by Shambhulal
 matlab saaf he ki use na sirf mobile uplabdh karavaaya gaya, balki sandesh bhi likhakar pahunchaaya gaya
 Both these videos of Shambhulal's hate haters are going viral
 video viral hone ke baad jail prashasan main hadakamp machaa hua he
 According to jail officials, the mobile used to shoot the video has not been recovered so far
 lekin jail prashasan ne kisi tarah kaa sandesh likhaa kaagaj kaa tukdaa paae jane kaa na to zikr kiya he or na hi is baat kaa pataa laga pai he ki shambhulaal ko yah sab kisne muhaiyaa karaayaa

 In the case related to the purchase of children in West Bengal, a strong drama took place even before Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Juhi Chaudhary was arrested by the police on Tuesday night
 siaidi ko juhi choudhary ke darjeeling main bharat-nepal seemaa se sirf 10 minute kii duuri par based kharibari block ke ek ghar main hone kii soochna mili thi

 Some policemen dressed as saffron and disguised the ascetics, and reached the same address on the pretext of asking for alms

 According to the police, Juhi Chaudhary has had an active role in this child trafficking racket, which was going on in Jalpaiguri in North Bengal, which has led to a large political dispute between the ruling Trinamool Congress and BJP in the state
 police kaa kahana he ki juhi choudhary giraftaar se bachane kii koshish kar rahi thim, or enjio chalaane vaali chandana chakravarti tathaa apni sahyogi sonaali mondal ke baad vah bhi nepal bhaag gai thim

 siaidi is baat kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki kya roopa ganguli ko juhi choudhary kii gatividhiyon ke bare main jaankaree thi yaa nahin, or kya juhi ne balgrih ko manzuri dilwane ke liye bhi unase madad maangi thi
 The comments kailash vijayawargeey ne aaropon kaa khandan karte hue jaanch par sawaal uthaae hai
 He has stressed that the investigation is being done at the behest of the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state
 roopa ganguli kaa kahana he ki tivi camaron ke saamne khadey hokar ek aaropee ke bayaan par pratikriya dene kii koi zarurat nahin he

 The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday reiterated that the event, which was to be attended by Mamata Banerjee in Chicago, was canceled by the organizers at the last minute under pressure from the ruling BJP

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee delivered a speech at the Ramakrishna Mission headquarters in Belur Math on the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda's historic address in Chicago
 mamata banerjee ne kaha, ‘main chicago janaa chaahati thi
 i could not go there because a certain conspiracy was being hatched by certain people

 ’mamata banerjee kaa ishaara chicago main 26 agast ko vivekananda vedanta sosayadi ke prastaavit kaarykram kii ore tha jise aayojakon ne ‘aakasmik kathinaaiyon’kaa hawala dete hue radd kar diya tha
 However, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ravish Kumar dismissed the report that Mamata Banerjee was not allowed to travel abroad, saying 'not true'

 While responding, the program was grasped by the 'global Hindu Congress'
 jabaki mamata banerjee ko nyotaa chicago kii vivekanand vedanta sosayadi kii ore se yojit hone vaale kaarykram ke liye mila tha jo radd kar diya gaya
 Also, the event was canceled long before the date of the event, so there was no need for him (mamata Banerjee) to seek political permission at first sight
 isliye videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa kii ore se ‘anumati nahin maange jane’sambandhi bayaan hi bemaayne tha

 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari shikast ke baad bhi party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel vimaan saude main kathith ghotaale ko lekar apane rukh main badlaav nahin kiya he
 On Thursday, when President Ramnath Kovind's address ended, he was asked questions outside the Parliament House
 rahul gandhi ne rafel ke mudde par kaha ki meraa stand abhi bhi vahi he, rafel vimaan saude main chori hui he
 However, when UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi was asked this question, she declined to comment on any kind
 bataa den ki raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne apane abhibhaashan main rafel vimaan kaa zikr kiya tha
 The President said that this year India will get its first Rafale fighter aircraft, which will increase the strength of the country's army
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi kii aguwai main congress party ne 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav rafel maamle par hi ladaa tha
 Rahul had targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this and accused him of stealing
 rahul gandhi ne ‘chaukeedaar chor he’ kaa naaraa puure chunaav prachaar main lagaaya
 However, Congress did not benefit from this campaign in the election
 rahul ke ‘chaukeedaar chor he’ ke jawaab main pradhanmantri modi ne ‘main bhi chaukeedaar’ campan launch kiya
 Which was made viral on social media, in addition to being launched at the ground level
 prachaar ke dauraan jab rahul gandhi rafel mudda jorshor se uthaa rahe the, tab unka daawa tha ki isi mudde kii vajah se narendra modi chunaav haar rahe hai
 However, when the results were out, the Congress was reduced to just 52 seats and it increased to only 8 seats as compared to 2014
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne rafel vimaan saude main pradhanmantri narendra modi par chori karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He said that the Prime Minister has given Anil Ambani a benefit of 30 thousand crores
 haalanki, sarkaar kii ore se lagaataar in daavon ko jhootha bataaya gaya
 This case also reached the Supreme Court, where for the first time the court had justified the process of Rafale aircraft deal
 haalanki, baad main is par dobaaraa yachika daayar kii gai thi
 As soon as the elections are over in the political circles of UP, along with the results, the most talked about interview of Mulayam Singh's wife Sadhana Gupta
 aisa isliye kyonki pehali baar unhone saarvajanik rup se kunbe kii kalah ke saath-saath akhilesh par apni chuppi todi he
 The timing of this interview is being discussed the most
 mana ja rahaa he ki yadi sadhana ko akhilesh par nishaanaa hi sadhana tha to vah chunaav ke pehle bhi kar sakati thim or yadi vah unako nishaanaa nahin bana rahi thim to do din ruk bhi sakati thim
 That is, she could do it after the election was over
 darasal is intervyuu ko siyaasi jaankaar ek ranneeti kaa hissaa maan rahe hai
 According to him, this is one of the stakes of Akhilesh's opponents in SP
 iske peeche mukhya kaaran yah mana ja rahaa he ki yadi akhilesh yadav chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab nahin ho pate hai to yah mana jayega ki sadhana gupta kii vah bhavishyavaanee sahi sabit hogi jisamen unhone kaha tha ki kunbe main kalah kaa kuch na kuch asar chunaav nateezon par hoga
 On this basis, anti-akhilesh powers will be active again after the elections and Akhilesh's domination within the party will be challenged
 party main haashie par pahunche shivpal yadav ne pehle hi chunaav nateezon ke baad alag party banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi lekin baad main vah palat gaye
 Such powers will again be vocal in the event of Akhilesh losing
 isse pehle upi main antim charan ke matdaan se pehle mangalvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav kii patni sadhana ne apni chuppi todate hue kaha ki galat samay party tuuti
 In a conversation with ANI, Sadhana said - There was no talk between my Akhilesh
 hamaari kabhi bahes tak nahin hui
 Akhilesh never gave me an answer
 maine kabhi use paraayaa nahin mana
 Time did what happened in the party
 ramgopal yadav ko lekar sadhana ne kaha ki professor ji netaji se bahut pyaar karte the, lekin bich main pataa nahin kya ho gaya, shaayad sab kuch samay ne karaayaa
 When Professor Sahab's wife was no more, i was the one who wiped her tears
 maine hi unke bacchon kii shaadiyaan karwaain
 Netaji also did not work without asking Professor Sahab
 sapa main kalah kaa asar chunaavon par kitna padegaa, isse jude sawaal par vah boleen ki nishchit taur par iskaa chunaavon par asar padegaa
 But i want our party to win again and Akhilesh Yadav becomes CM
 mujhe nahin pataa akhilesh ko kisne bahakaaya he
 He respected me and Netaji very much
 1 janvari se akhilesh ke saath meri itani baatcheet hui, jitani paanch saalon main bhi nahin hui
 The comments raajnneeti main aane ko lekar unhone kaha ki netaji ne kabhi aane nahin diya, par haa peeche se kaam karte rahe hai, lekin ab main raajnneeti main nahin aana chaahati, main chaahati hum ki meraa betaa pratik raajnneeti main aae
 Sadhna became emotional on the question related to the separation of Akhilesh Yadav and said that he (akhilesh-dimple) does not feel like going to the room
 kaise us kamare main jaaen jisamen betaa-bahu rahe hon, bachche rahe hon
 Even today, the rooms are closed after cleaning
 kabhi nahin sochaa tha netaji ke jite ji akhilesh alag ho jaaenge
 Actually, this interview is being considered by political experts as part of a strategy
 unke mutabik yah sapa main akhilesh virodhiyon kaa ek daanv he
 The main reason behind this is that if Akhilesh Yadav is not able to win the election, then it will be believed that the prophecy of Sadhna Gupta will prove to be correct in which he said that there is some effect of discord in the election results
 Will happen
 isi aadhaar par chunaav baad akhilesh virdohi shaktiyaan phir se sakriy hongi or party ke bheetar akhilesh ke varchasv ko chunauti di jaaegi
 Shivpal Yadav, who was marginalized in the party, had already announced the formation of a separate party after the election results, but later he turned around
 akhilesh ke haarane kii sthiti main is tarah kii shaktiyaan phir se mukhar hongi
 Earlier on Tuesday, Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife Sadhana broke her silence before the last phase of voting in UP, saying that the party broke at the wrong time
 ANI se baatcheet main sadhana ne kaha- mere akhilesh ke bich koi baat hi nahin thi
 We have never even had an argument
 akhilesh ne kabhi mujhe jawaab tak nahin diya
 i never considered him alien
 party main jo kuch hua, vah samay ne karaayaa
 Regarding Ram Gopal Yadav, Sadhna said that Professor ji loved Netaji very much, but in the midst of it did not know what happened, maybe everything was done by time
 professor sahab kii patni jab nahin rahi thim to maine hi unke aansu ponche the
 i got their children's weddings done
 netaji bhi professor sahab se puche bina kaam nahin karte the
 On the question related to how much discord in SP will affect the elections, she said that it will definitely have an impact on elections
 lekin main chaahati hum ki hamaari party dobaaraa jite or akhilesh yadav siem bane
 i do not know who has seduced Akhilesh
 vah to meraa or netaji kaa bahut aadar karte the
 From January 1, i had such a conversation with Akhilesh, not even in five years
 tippaniyan On coming into politics, he said that Netaji never let him come, but yes he has been working from behind, but now i do not want to get into politics, i want my son Prateek to enter politics
 akhilesh yadav ke alag ho jane se jude sawaal par sadhana bhavuk ho gayi or kaha ki unke (akhilesh-dimple) kamare main jane kaa hi man nahin karata
 How to go to the room in which sons and daughters-in-law are children
 aaj bhi kamare safai hone ke baad band ho jate hai
 Never thought that Akhilesh would be separated from Netaji's life
 isse pehle upi main antim charan ke matdaan se pehle mangalvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav kii patni sadhana ne apni chuppi todate hue kaha ki galat samay party tuuti

 Special on 13 February Hag Day, how did you celebrate your childhood when your mother was angry with you
 yaad aayaa? bilkul sahi aap unke gale lag jate the
 Then you did not know where the anger of the mother goes as soon as she hugs
 magar gussa chalaa jarur jaataa tha
 Actually, when we hug someone, the hormones of the body change
 gusse ko badhaane vaala mail hormone testesteron kam hone lagata he or aapkaa gussa shant ho jaataa he
 We are not just saying this
 haal hi main california vishvavidhyalay kii ore se kiye gaye shodh main bhi yah yah baat saamne aayi he ki ek jaadu kii jhappi se gussa turant pigal jaataa he
 According to a report published in the newspaper Telegraph, research conducted by the University of California has revealed that clasp and touch are related to many health properties that reduce stress and pain
 shodh ke anusaar iskaa prabhaav sabase zyada mahilaon par hota he
 That is, if women are angry, then they can be celebrated by giving them a hug of magic
 manovishaleshak doctor vandana prakaash ne bataaya ki gale lagane ke saath hi hamaare sharir se gusse ko badhaane ke liye jimmedaar hormone teji se kam hone lagata he
 One feels love in hugging someone, that is, when you hug someone, it means to show love towards them
 use yah bataanaa ki aapse galati ho gayi vah aapako maaf kar de
 If you say in common language, just one hug can melt the anger like a puff
 pyaar se gale lagane kaa prachlan hamaare desh main hameshaa se rahaa he
 But the hug trend started with the film 'munna Bhai MBBS'
 jab film main munna bhai sabhi ko jaadu kii jhappi detaa tha to logon kii ankhon main aansu aa jate the or is film main kisi ko gale lagane ke peeche darshai gai sadichha ne use jaadu kii jhappi bana diya
 In Valentine's Week, 'hug Day' is probably connected so that if you have anger towards someone, then before celebrating the day of love, you should embrace and cool your anger and celebrate Valentine's Day with a big bang with everyone
 velentine de se thik ek din pehle manaae jane ke kaaran iskaa mahatv bhi bahut zyada hota he

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar has once again besieged Pakistan about Dawood Ibrahim's whereabouts
 raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki daaud ibrahim kahaan chipa he, yah tathy har koi jaanata he
 Every year India assigns Pakistan a list containing the names of criminals who are wanted in India
 raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki bharat pakistan se har baar kahata he ki aise tatwon ko bharat ko waapas saunp de yaa unhen bain kare
 India is doing this continuously
 daaud kii mumbai serial bam blast main bhoomika behad saaf he
 The Indian media has also been successful in talking to Dawood
 sanyukt raashtra sangh kii ore se ghoshit antkavaadiyon ko pakistan ko har haal main bharat ko saunp dena chahie
 Ravish Kumar said that it is very clear that the links of the terrorists are with Pakistan
 lekin pakistan main maujuud aatankiyon kii list dekhne ke baad lagata he ki pakistan keval antarrashtriya samudaay se kahata he ki vah aatanki sanghathanon or aatankiyon ko khilaaf karrwai kar rahaa he lekin hakeekat main aisa kuch nahin karata he
 Pakistan does nothing when it comes to action
 pakistan jameen par aatankwaadi pal rahe hai phir bhi pakistan kahata rahata he ki vah aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahaa he
 The Ministry of External Affairs said that whenever India demands action against terrorists, Pakistan either ignores the point of India, or rejects it
 pakistan is baat se sidhe inkaar karata he ki vahaan aatanki chhipe hue hai
 On the other hand, Pakistan constantly presents itself as if it is not with the terrorists
 pakistani jameen par aaj bhi aatankwaadi pal rahe hai, jo vaishvik samudaay ke liye bhi chintajanak hai
 This situation in Pakistan shows its duplicity
 pakistan main aatanki sanghathan or aatankwaadi donon pal rahe hai
 It shows the dual character of Pakistan
 vahiin hafiz said ko lekar raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki jab pakistan ke uthaae gaye kadamon ko ham dekhte hai
 You (pakistan) claim to take action, but when it comes to taking action against those involved in anti-india activities, you do nothing
 duusari ore aap antarrashtriya samudaay ko dhokhaa dene kii koshish karte hai
 It has been told that the format, topics, sub-topics, invited speakers, guests, arrangements etc

 He was currently undergoing treatment at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences
 bataa den ki peedit chaatr ke abhibhavak tailor kaa kaam karte the
 After getting information about the incident, Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy rushed to the hospital to meet the injured
 unhone kaha tha ki yah behad dukhad he ki kuch log choti baat par bhi itnaa bada kadam uthaa lete hai
 Significantly, this is not the first such case
 isse pehle dilli ke indrapuri ilaake main ek aisa hi maamla saamne aayaa tha
 Where a student studying in the seventh grade had committed suicide
 police ke anusaar chaatra ne yah kadam tab uthaaya tha jab uski maa ghar main maujuud nahin thi
 The police officer investigating the case had said that the student had also written a suicide note on her palm
 vahiin isse pehle civil services kii taiyaari kar rahe 23 varshiya chaatr ne kuch maheene pehle karol baag stesan par metro train ke saamne kudakar kathith taur par khudakushi kii koshish kii thi

 It was being told that there was an injury to the forehead of the young man and he was kept under observation at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya tha ki mumbai kaa rahane vaala yuvak civil services kii taiyaari karata tha or purvi dilli ke nirmaan vihaar main apane dost ke saath rahata tha

 bukamp bhale hi myanmar main aayaa ho, lekin isaki dehshat dilli tak mahasoos kii gai
 Three mild earthquakes have been felt here in the last three days
 bukamp vigyaan centre ke mutabik dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon se kai folt hokar guzarate hai
 The main among these fault lines are delhi-moradabad Fault, delhi-haridwar and Sohna Fault
 folt jone wo ilaake hote hai, jinamein chattaane alag-alag disha main movement kar rahi hoti hai
 All these fault lines in Delhi's most dangerous zone have the potential to cause earthquakes of magnitude 6
 yani dilli or aas-paas ke ilaakon main richter scale par 6 ke pariman kabukampaka centre ho saktaa he
 But Delhi is not as much threatened by any local earthquake as any earthquake in the Himalayas
 himalayake najadik hone or badi aabaadi kaa shahar hone kii vajah se rajdhani dilli ko bukamp ke lihaaj se jone chaar main rakhaa jaataa he
 That is, the zone after the most dangerous zone
 
 
 
 The loss to Qutub Minar was then
 If you look directly at the capital Delhi, the distance of the Himalayas is between 200 to 250 km
 himachal ke kangra ilaake main agar koi 8 yaa isse bade pariman kaa bukamp aata he to dilli par iskaa sidhaa asar padegaa
 If there is an earthquake of magnitude 8 or 9 in Garhwal or Kunmayun of Uttarakhand, then it will have a severe impact on Delhi
 haal ke saalon main kanthmandu bukamp ko dilli tak mahasoos kiya gaya tha
 In such a situation, it would not be wrong to say that the loss of life and property in Delhi due to a huge earthquake in the Himalayas can not be denied
 1803 main gadhwal main aae ek bheeshan bukamp se aisa kaha jaataa he ki qutubameenar kii upree manzil ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 There are all kinds of construction work, illegal construction, government construction, private houses and houses built by private builders in the dangerous zone of the trans-yamuna area
 sabase badi samasya ye he ki imaaraton ke liye sarkaar ne building code to bana diya
 But there is no government agency to monitor whether someone is following it or not
 aise main building code ko kadai se lagu kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Recently microzonation was done in the capital Delhi
 isamen paaya gaya ki yamuna paar ke ilaake, dilli uniwarsity ke paas ke ilaake bukamp ke lihaaj se sabase zyada nuksaan uthaaenge
 The reason is that in the event of an earthquake in these areas, water will start coming out of the ground and buildings will sink into it
 raisina hills sabase surakshit ilakgar dilli rij or raisina hills kii baat karen to microjonaton ke lihaaj se ye dilli ke sabase surakshit ilaake hai
 But the microzoning map needs to be made more closely
 bukamp se nipatane ke sabhi sadhano ko jald se jald jutaney kii jarurat he, kyonki bahut bada bukamp himachay main kabhi bhi aa saktaa he

 Two of the 3 friends who went to bathe in Myamunandi in Delhi died by drowning
 teenon dost nahaane ke liye yamuna nadi main utre the, jinamein se do yamuna main dub gaye
 The case is of Buradi Jagatpur Ghat of Delhi
 yahaan teen dost- varun, pratik or manoj yamuna main nahaane gayi the
 They did not understand while taking bath and they went into deep water
 sthaneey logon kaa aarope he ki buraadi or jagatpur main bade paimaane par yamuna main ret khanan kiya jaataa he jiske chalate yamuna jagah-jagah se gahari ho chuki he
 They say that the youths who took bath could not know the depth of the river
 sthaneey log bataate hai ki pichley kuch dinon se lagaataar yamuna main ho rahe haadason main badhotaree kii vajah avaidh khanan hi he
 People say that there are no security arrangements on the banks of the Yamuna
 inkaa kahana he ki agar yamuna main nahaane ja rahe logon ko hidaayat di jaae or unhen gahare pani main jane se roka jaae to aise haadase ruk sakate the
 Among the deceased, 21-year-old Manoj was a resident of Sant Nagar in Burari and was preparing for BMS Doctor from Dehradun
 do din baad hi vah apane college jane vaala tha lekin usase pehle apane do doston ke saath yamuna main nahaane gaya or ghar laut kar nahin aayaa
 Manoj's friend Varun has also been a victim of this accident
 kuch dinon se jis tareeke se yamuna main haadase hue hai usko dekhte hue logon kaa sawaal uthaanaa lajimi he
 The truth is that there are no security arrangements at the ghats along the Yamuna, due to which there are frequent accidents
 sthaneey logon ne jagah jagah par gotakhoron kii bhi tainaati kii maang kii he
 During Google i / o 2019, Sundar Pichai has told about the major changes related to software in the coming days
 company ne Duplex or Next Generation Google Assistant ke bare main bataaya he
 Duplex has been improved by the company before and gradually its scope will also be expanded
 Google Assistant ab pehle se zyada smart he
 If you do not know about Duplex, then tell that the company last launched it in its developer conference
 iske tahat aapke liye Duplex sarvice aapke bihalf par restron main teble book kara saktaa he, tikat book kara saktaa he wo bhi kol karke
 However, it was introduced for the test in some US cities after a long time
 ab iskaa dayera badhaayaa gaya he
 Duplex haryana main ek bank ne difolter karjadaaron se apni rakam vasuulne ke liye anoothaa tarika nikaala he
 The bank has made big posters with photos, names, addresses of all such people and got them installed in all its branches
 bank ke mutabik aisa nahin he ki ye log bank kii rakam bharne kii sthiti main nahin he balki ye jaan boojh kar aisa nahin karte
 On the other hand, the farmers say that in the event of crop failure due to natural disaster, they would not be able to repay the bank's amount in time
 in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki iskaa ye matlab nahin ki bank unki photo samet poster lagaakar unhen sharmasaar karen
 It is true that debt waiver is a good electoral weapon of political parties
 baqayada chunaav ghoshnapatron main 'karj hoga maaf, bijli kaa bill hof' jaise lubhaavni naare tak die jate hai
 If there is a natural disaster, then one can understand the debt waiver of poor farmers
 duusari ore bank kaa kahana he ki in dinon bainkon se karj lene vaale kuch rasukhdaar log bhi kisaanon kii aad lete hai or bank se karj lene ke baad uski waapas adaayagi main aana-kani karte hai
 Preeti, an officer of Sarva Haryana Gramin Bank's Narwana branch, told Aaj Tak that all those whose posters have been installed, owe more than five lakh rupees to the bank
 priti ke mutabik bank se karj lekar waapas naa karne waalon kii vajah se hi bainkon kaa non parforming asset (NPA) badhata ja rahaa he
 According to Preeti, this path has been adopted after failing in every way of recovering money from defaulters
 naa aise logon ko police kaa dar he or naa hi bank kaa
 The posters have been put up because when other customers coming to the bank look at them and go back and tell these defaulters, they might feel ashamed and think about returning the bank money
 bank adhikari priti ne kaha ki aisa nahin he ki ye saare log bank kii rakam lautaane kii sthiti main nahin he
 One or two are not returning the bank money due to their strong political contacts
 jab recovery ke liye jaao to kehete hai, 'jab mukhyamantri rah chuke tak tak jail ja saken to ham bhi chale jaaenge, kya fark padataa he
 According to Preity, the ghost of debt waiver by some governments has been filled
 yahi sochate hai ki karj maafee aa jaaegi
 Preity said that it is not that these people cannot give back the bank money, in fact it is not willing to do so
 ye puche jane par ki jab bank karj detaa he to ise lene vaale kii padtaal nahin karata, priti ne kaha ki bank kii ore se sab kuch thok baja kar dekha jaataa he
 Everything looks fine when you visit the site
 lekin dikkat ye hoti he ki jis praayojan ke liye karj liya hota he, use aage chalakar badal diya jaataa he
 For example, if someone takes a loan for a shop, then on visiting, there is a shop and it also contains goods
 kuch vakt tak bank ko thik se bhugtan bhi kiya jaataa he
 But later the store is closed and the goods are also sold
 priti ne bataaya ki aise logon ke khilaaf kanoonee rasta apanaate hue cese bhi kiye jate hai
 However, it is understood that the poor farmers have not been able to repay the loan from the bank in case of crop failure
 lekin rasukhdaar log bhi bank se karj lekar hadap jaaen yaa kundali maar kar baithe rahe to unase nipatane kaa kya tarika he
 The case of investigation by the CBI on allegations of corruption against two senior Army officers has given a rethink to the Ministry of Defense's policy of promotion of officers in the three Services (army, Navy and Air Force)
 ek durlabh kadam uthaate hue raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne spasht sanket de diya jab unhone sena ke major general rank ke donon adhikariyon kii padonnati ke maamle ko cabinet kii niyukti samiti (asisi) ko saunp diya
 He wrote to the committee that both the officers should be promoted only when the investigating agency gave them a clean chit
 cabinet kii niyukti samiti main pradhanmantri or grahamantri shaamil rahete hai
 Both officers were to be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General
 ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir kaise ye donon adhikari itane oonche padon tak pahunch gaye
 Sources said that officers are closely monitored at every rank so that only qualified people are promoted
 raksha mantri dwaara pramotion ko sashart bananaa isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki donon adhikariyon ke purv ke padon par rahete hue hi bhrashtachar ke aarope lage
 Sources told NDTV that the ministry wants promotions to be based on merit rather than the main criteria such as age and time remaining in promotions for higher positions like lieutenant general
 tippaniyan At the moment, a lieutenant general must have at least two years of job remaining to become army chief
 ye sara maamla umr par aakar ruk jaataa he
 a senior defense ministry official said that in this way the importance of ability, competence and preference decreases and promotion to the next rank depends on how much your job is left and how many positions are vacant
 ye bhi aarope hai ki adhikari apane pasandida logon ko hi chunate hai
 Major General Ravi Arora (retd) says, 'the process is correct but due to loyalty and family spirit to its regiment, there is a possibility of it being manipulated

 sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya ki leftinent general jaise ucch padon par pramotion ke liye umr or naukari main bache samay jaise mukhya maapdandon kii bajaay mantralay chahta he ki pramotion yogyata ke aadhaar par hon
 The comments philhal, ek leftinent general ke sena pramukh banane ke liye kam se kam do saal kii naukari shesh honi chahie
 This whole matter stops on coming of age

 There are also allegations that officers choose their favorite people only
