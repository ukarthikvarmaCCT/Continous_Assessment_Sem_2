 shehryaar ne kaha, ‘‘is sahmati ke tahat vah world cap tak captain hai or unhone kaha ki vah pratiyogita ke baad sanyas le lenge
 If he changes his mind and wants to play further, then it will have to be seen whether he is selected as a player or not
 ’’ However, the PCB chairman clarified that the board did not make a mistake by appointing Afridi as the captain of the national T20 team last year

 us roj shaam 6 baje khun ke pyaase hinduon kii bheed musalamaanon ko nishaanaa bana rahi thi
 He was angry at the killing of 59 'ram sevaks' at Godhra railway station a day earlier, on 27 February
 ek bheed ne purvi ahmedabad sthit gulburg socity main 69 logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 Muzaffar, a boy of two years old, was crying loudly near that society
 vah apni fufee 18 varshiya firoza kii baahon se phisalkar gir gaya tha
 Firoza along with her brother Salim Sheikh and nephew Imran were hiding in the house of Congress leader Ehsan Jafri
 lekin bheed ne use daboch liya or katl kar diya
 By then Jaffery had also been killed
 saleem kaa betaa mujffar jinda batch gaya
 When Muzaffar was crying alone, a little away from the site of the massacre, a shopkeeper Vikram Patni, who has passed away, and his wife Veena, who sells fish, turned to him
 ve paas ke hi muhalle chamanpura main rahete the
 They took pity on the child and picked him up and took him to his three-room house
 unhone us bachche kii jaankaree ek consteble ko di lekin usne suzav diya ki ve philhal bachche ko apane paas rakhen kyonki sthiti bahut kharaab he
 After about 15 days, the couple fell in love with the beautiful child and they adopted her
 mujffar ab vivek ban gaya
 This sad but beautiful story would have ended here if the Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate the 2002 riots would not have interfered
 usne vivek ke asli pita, 35 varshiya saleem or 32 varshiya maa jebunnisa kaa pataa laga liya or teenon ko mila diya
 Vivek is now living a double life
 vah somvaar se shanivaar tak 59 varshiya veena ke saath rahata he, jinke pati vikram kaa 2004 main dehanth ho gaya
 Every Sunday he meets his real parents and brothers-14-year-old Imran, 10-year-old Faizan and 9-year-old Firdaus
 use pyaar se mujju kehete hai
 He studies in class VI in a municipal school near Veena's house
 uske pasandida actor hrithik roshan hai or jinhen usne dhooma-2 main dekha tha
 He also likes Sachin Tendulkar because 'he plays for the country with dedication
 ' lekin vah bhramit he
 He prays for a week in front of the picture of Chamundamata, the goddess of the veena
 uskaa kahana he ki vah 'veena maa' ke bina jinda nahin rah saktaa
 He says in the presence of his real father, 'I cannot live without him, though i also like my real parents (zebunnisa and Salim)
 ' do dharmon or do pariwaron ke bich fansaa vah ladkaa itnaa kahkar rone lagata he
 Salim and Zebunnisa petitioned the court to get Vivek from Veena in November 2008 on the advice of the SIT
 lekin veena apane vivek ko chhodane ke liye taiyaar nahin thim
 He argued that after Vikram's death, that is his only support
 unhone nichali adaalat se yah tathy chipa liya ki unka ek betaa or teen betiyaan hai or sabaki shaadi ho chuki he
 Then eight-year-old Vivek also favored Veena
 natijatan, adaalat ne janvari, 2009 main faisla sunaaya ki vivek ko veena ke saath rahanaa chahie kyonki unhone hi use pyaar se paala-posa he
 This decision caused a deep shock to Salim and Jebunnisa
 unhen ummid thi ki ab unka khoyaa hua baccha mil jayega
 The couple petitioned the High Court in 2009 to take Vivek under her protection
 hycourt is prakaran se dravit ho uthaa
 In February 2010, he ruled that Vivek would remain with Veena from Monday to Saturday until his next notice and with his real parents on Sunday
 pichley do saal se saleem ravivaar kii subah vivek ko lene ke liye apni motorcycle par ahmedabad ke chamanpura ilaake main veena ke ghar jate hai or use vahaan se nimna madhyavargeey vatava ilaake main sthit apane nae do kamaron vaale ghar main laate hai
 By the evening he again approaches Veena, who as a fish seller, gets Rs 10,000 every month
 kii kamai se ghar chalaati hai
 7,000 as a factory laborer every month
 kamaane vaale saleem aaj bhi us din ko nahin bhoolatey jis din mujffar or firoza kho gaye the
 They say, 'on that fateful day we were running to hide
 meri bivi shahar ke duusare hisse main apane rishtedaaron ke paas chali gai thi
 While we were running, i felt that Feroza was following back with Muzaffar
 lekin baad main hamane paaya ki khooni bheed ne firoza ko katl kar diya or mujffar kho gaya he
 When we did not find Muzaffar for months, we thought he was dead
 hamane muslim reeti-rivaaj se uskaa antim sanskaar bhi kar diya
 According to Salim, SIT contacted him in November 2008 and asked him to come to a government hospital for a DNA test
 ve kehete hai, 'ham pareshaan the ki test ke peeche kya kaaran ho saktaa he
 After 15 days, he again said on the phone that we should come to the office where there can be good news for us
 unhone hamen ek chote bachche kii puraani photo dikhaai
 Before he said anything, we said that this is a photo of our lost son Muzaffar
 jebunnisa ne khushi se ronaa shuru kar diya
 But i remained patient
 ' saleem ko khojane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale esaity ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, ve apni duusari koshish main hi kaamyaab ho gaye
 He had earlier called a Muslim couple whose DNA was not found from Muzaffar
 veena or vikram ne esaity ko shuru main bataaya tha ki mujffar unhen dangon ke chaar maheene baad mila, jabaki unhone gulburg narsanhaar ke chand ghanton ke bheetar use uthaa liya tha
 Salim says that if Muzaffar wants to live with his 'veena Maa' then they will let him stay with them
 ve kehete hai, 'aise main agar use hindu ke rup main paala-posa jaataa he to main ise allaah kii marji maan luungaa
 After all, Veena and Vikram saved her life
 hamaari samasya jebunnisa he jo mujffar ke bina nahin rah sakati
 'this type of incident can shock a child forever,' says Prashant Bhimani, chief psychologist of Gujarat
 mujffar ko apni jindagi kaa faisla khud karne diya jaae
 Zebunnisa is missing out on losing Firoza
 'ham mujffar kii jaan bachaane ke liye veena ke abhaari hai lekin use paane ke baad main use dobaaraa khona nahin chaahati
 'even after 10 years of riots, two families have to pay dearly for it

 smart to thik he lekin 'dhere smart' hona thik nahin mana jaataa he
 From the locality to the class room many times must have been interrupted
 ajeeb shabd he smart
 Goodness is also visible and chalupana
 bharat kii aatma gaanvon main basati he
 Hearing, now is the time to hear that this soul will now rise from the villages and be brought to the cities
 badi sankhya main ye aatma shahar aegi to dhang ke shahar hone chahie isliye smart city basaaya ja rahaa he
 Not one hundred jo based hue ansmart tareeke se unhen bhi smart banaaya jayega
 Some saloons also have names
 jaise wasim smart salun
 Smart city in the same way
 bharat sarkaar 100 nae smart city banane ja rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi's cabinet has approved this project
 shaharon ke buniyadi sudhaar ke liye bane jeenyuarem yojana kii jagah nai yojana aa gai he jiskaa angreji naam he atal mishan for rijuvanation and urban transformation lekin ye sankshep main hindi sanskrit ke amrit jaisaa sunai detaa he
 Under this, 100 new and 500 old cities will be made smart
 is yojana ke liye ek lakh karod kaa bajet banaaya gaya he
 JNURM was started in 2005 with a target to improve the infrastructure of cities
 kai jagah acha kaam hua he lekin kai jagahon main kaam ke naam par paisa tamaam hi hua he
 In 2012, the CAG reported that out of 1298 schemes approved under JNURM, only 231 were completed
 is yojana ke tahat 65 hazaar karod se zyada kaa bajet diya gaya lekin sarkaar ne aadha se zyada paisa relies hi nahin kiya
 Every state will have at least one smart city under the new AMRUT scheme
 jis shahar yaa jagah kaa naam smart city main aayega use paanch saal ke liye har saal 100 karod kii madad milegi
 There is a debate all over the world as to what is a smart city and for whom
 china, korea or saudi main smart city banakar taiyaar bhi ho chukaa he or kai deshon main jaise rio di janerio, madrid tip ke puraane shaharon ko smart kiya ja rahaa he
 In 2008, IBM company developed the concept of smart city but now many IT and finance companies are involved in creating smart city
 ye smart city mek in india se nahin balki videshi companiyon ke sahyog se banegi
 This January, when US President Obama came to India, there was an agreement that America will help make three cities smart in India
 teen smart shahar banane main madad karegaa
 Allahabad, Ajmer and Visakhapatnam
 2014-15 ke bajet main smart city ke kareeb 7000 karod kii raashi tay karte hue kaha tha ki smart shahar bade shaharon ke satellite kii tarah basenge
 Like Navi Mumbai near Mumbai and Greater Noida near Delhi
 is tarah kai multi neshnal companiyaan ab smart city banane ke kaam main lagi hai
 Whether or not our homegrown real estate people will get a chance will know all this later
 upie sarkaar ke samay kerala ke kochi, gujarat ke ahmedabad, maharashtra ke aurangabad, haryana ke manesar, rajasthan ke khushkeda, andhrapradesh ke krishnapattan, tamilnadu ke ponneri or karnataka ke tumkur main smart city kii yojana launch kii gai thi
 In 2012, Kamal Nath announced that he would build two smart cities in each state
 iske liye upie ne jeenenyuarem ke tahat smart city ke liye 2013 ke bajet main 18500 karod kii raashi tay kii thi
 What the UPA could do in two years is not known, but now Prime Minister Modi is going ahead on the plan to build 100 smart cities
 sarkaar ek taraf gaanvon ko digital banane kii taiyaari main lagi he to duusari taraf gaanv se shahar aane waalon ke liye digital shahar bana rahi he
 All these people who will reduce India's urban population to 70 percent, will be asked by any political party, whether or not they will be eligible to live in smart city through mobile sensor
 shahar apane aap main ek vishay he
 Scholars studying it are asking that seventy percent of people in Delhi, Mumbai are of average income or are poor
 jyadatar log galiyon ke konon main apni dukaane laga lete hai, patariyon par chaat, chinia baadaam bech lete hai, ped ke neeche maaruti car ke bonut par juute se lekar kapadaa bech lete hai or aaraam se garmi ke dinon main bel to sardi ke dinon main anda bechakar ji lete hai
 Will there be a place for these people in the smart city
 kisi ko iske bare main thik se pataa nahin he or na hi hamaare raajnneetik dalon kii is par koi samaj bani he
 By the way, our builders keep launching such cities every year
 ab to bees pachis hazaar kii aabaadi vaale in privet shaharon main thane se lekar skool tak banane lage hai
 You must have seen that outside the city of builders, from a textile presser to a vegetable shop, it feeds
 kya smart city main use chance milegaa
 Can the existing cities not be much better off? vaise duniya ke kai puraane shaharon ne khud ko behatar karne ke liye 20 se 50 million dollar ke project banaae hai
 Rio de Janeiro, madrid et cetera
 (hamane ye video cisco company kii site se liya he) dakshin korea kaa smart shahar songdo he jo 2009 main launch hua tha
 Songdo is to become a finance city like Hong Kong and Singapore
 yahaan sab kuch automatic he
 From a center you can control the temperature or energy consumption of any building
 sensor se aapako mobile par sandesh aa jayega ki kab bas aane vaali he, mobile par samasya tip kiijie, sthaneey prashasan ko pataa chal jayega
 With this, the question arises in the context of India whether our governments will also change the administration and rights of the municipality for this
 sitambar 2013 main bibisi or ek saal baad nanvabar 2014 main financial express ne likhaa he ki songdo ke karmtial spes kaa 20 pratishat bhi istamaal nahin ho sakaa he
 Your anchor does not know what is the situation right now
 tippaniyan Like Songdo, a phase of a finance city in India has been completed
 2007 main mukhyamantri ke taur par narendra modi ne isaki buniyaad rakhi thi jo 2022 main puraa hoga or puraa hone tak isamen kareeb 8 xxrep 4 0 karod rupaya lag jayega
 According to what i can understand, the Gujarat government partnered with a Mumbai company by taking wastelands and formed a new company
 nai company ne 1000 karod se zyada kii puunji lone se ugaahi or ek dhaancha taiyaar kar diya
 The gift is also like Songdo
 yahaan par centrali kooling plant he jiske zariye sari imaaraton ke taapmaana ko niyantrit kiya jayega
 There will be huge energy savings
 vaise hi sari imaaraton kaa kachra basament se ek pipe ke zariye kendriya west management plant main chalaa jayega
 The underground tunnel is built next to the roads with separate pipes to carry cold air for electricity, water, waste and AC
 china ne bhi aise kai smart city banaae hai
 Village to village zamindoz was given for smart city but no one living there now
 itani tezi se itane shahar bana diye ki zyaadaatar smart city khaali he
 These smarts have now been renamed
 inhen ghost yani bhootaha shahar kaha ja rahaa he
 What is not there, is not just man
 technology ke dam par shahar kii kshamta kaa vikaas to ho jayega magar kya shahar shahar rah jayega
 There are many questions regarding the smart city
 raajnneetik sawaal bhi hai or aarthik bhi
 Government of India is going to build 100 new smart cities
 pradhanmantri modi kii cabinet ne is pariyojna ko manzuri de di he
 a new scheme has come in place of the JNURM scheme for the basic improvement of cities, whose English name is Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, but it briefly sounds like the nectar of Hindi Sanskrit
 iske tahat 100 nae or 500 puraane shaharon ko smart banaaya jayega
 a budget of one lakh crore has been made for this scheme
 2005 main jeenyuarem shuru hui thi jiske tahat shaharon ke buniyadi dhaanchon main sudhaar karne kaa lakshya tay kiya gaya tha
 Good work has been done in many places but in many places money has been made in the name of work
 2012 main sieji ne report di thi ki jeenyuaram ke tahat manzur 1298 yojanaon main se 231 hi puri hui hai
 Under this scheme, a budget of more than 65 thousand crores was given, but the government did not release more than half the money
 nai amrit yojana ke tahat har rajya main kam se kam ek smart shahar hoga
 The city or place where the name will come in the smart city will get 100 crores every year for five years
 puri duniya main bahes he ki smart city kya he or kiske liye he
 Smart cities have also been prepared in China, Korea and Saudi and in many countries like Rio de Janeiro, old cities of Madrid type are being smartened
 2008 main ibiem company ne smart city kii avadharana viksit kii thi lekin ab kai ai or finans companiyaan smart city banane main shaamil hai
 This smart city will not be made with Make in India but with the help of foreign companies
 is janvari jab america ke raashtrapati obama bharat aae to yah qaraar hua ki america bharat main teen shaharon ko smart banane main madad karegaa
 Will help build three smart cities
 elahabaad, ajmer or vishakhapatnam
 In the budget for 2014-15, while deciding the amount of about 7000 crores of smart cities, it was said that smart cities will settle like satellites of big cities
 jaise mumbai ke paas navi mumbai he or dilli ke paas greater noida
 In this way, many multi-national companies are now engaged in the task of building smart cities
 hamaare desi real estate waalon ko mauka milegaa yaa nahin yah sab baad main pataa chalegaa
 The smart city scheme was launched at Kochi in Kerala, Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Manesar in Haryana, Kushkera in Rajasthan, Krishnapatna in Andhra Pradesh, Ponneri in Tamil Nadu and Tumkur in Karnataka during the UPA government
 2012 main kamalnath ne elaan kiya tha ki har rajya main do smart city banaaenge
 For this, UPA had fixed 18500 crore in the 2013 budget for smart city under JNNURM
 do saal main upie kya kar pai pataa nahin lekin ab pradhanmantri modi 100 smart city banane kii yojana par aage badhane ja rahe hai
 The government is preparing to make villages digital on one hand and on the other side is making digital cities for those coming from village to city
 ye saare log jo bharat kii shahari aabaadi ko 70 fisadi kar denge mobile sensor ke zariye smart city main rahane yogya honge yaa nahin ye sawaal to kisi raajnneetik dal ko poochna chahie
 The city is a subject in itself
 isaki padhai karne vaale vidwaan puch rahe hai ki dilli, mumbai main sattar fisadi log ausat aay vaale hote hai yaa garib hote hai
 Most people set up their shops in the corners of the streets, licking on the tracks, selling cinnamon almonds, selling shoes on the bonnet of a Maruti car under a tree, and the bells in the summer days, in winter They live by selling eggs
 kya in logon ke liye smart city main koi jagah hogi
 No one knows about it properly nor has our political parties made any sense on it
 vaise hamaare buildergan har saal is tarah kii city launch karte rahete hai
 Now these private cities with a population of twenty-five thousand have started being built from the police station to the school
 aapane dekha hoga ki bilderon kii city ke baahar kapadaa press karne vaala se lekar sabji vaala dukaan lagaakar pet paalataa he
 Will he get a chance in the smart city? kya maujuuda shahar ek had se zyada behatar nahin ho sakate
 By the way, many old cities of the world have built projects of 20 to 50 million dollars to better themselves
 rio da janerio, madrid vagairah
 (we took this video from the Cisco company site) South Korea's smart city is Songdo which was launched in 2009
 songdo ko honkong, singapore kii tarah finans city bananaa he
 Everything here is automatic
 ek centre se aap kisi bhi imaarat kaa taapmaana yaa urja kii khapat niyantrit kar sakate hai
 You will get a message on the mobile from the sensor that when the bus is about to arrive, type the problem on the mobile, the local administration will know
 isi se bharat ke sandarbh main sawaal uthta he ki kya iske liye hamaari sarkarein nagarpalika ke prashasan or adhikaron main bhi badlaav karegi
 In September 2013, BBC and a year later in November 2014, Financial Express wrote that not even 20 percent of Songdo's commercial space has been used
 abhi kya sthiti he aapke ankar ko nahin maaloom
 The comments songdo kii tarah bharat main ek finans city kaa ek charan banakar taiyaar ho gaya he
 In 2007, as the Chief Minister, Narendra Modi laid the foundation for it which will be completed in 2022 and till its completion it will take about 8 xxrep 4 0 crores
 jitna main samaj sakaa hum uske anusaar gujarat sarkaar ne banzar bhoomi lekar mumbai kii ek company se saajhedaari kii or ek nai company bana lee
 The new company raised capital loans of more than 1000 crores and created a structure
 gift bhi songdo kii tarah he
 There is a centrally cooling plant through which the temperature of all buildings will be controlled
 urja kii baari bachat hogi
 Similarly, the waste of all the buildings will be passed from the basement through a pipe to the Central Waste Management Plant
 sadakon ke bagal main underground tunnel bana he jisamen bijli, pani, kachra or asi ke liye thandi hawa le jane kii alag-alag pipe hai
 China has also built many such smart cities
 gaanv ke gaanv zameendos kar diye gaye smart city ke liye magar ab vahaan rahane vaala koi nahin
 Made so many cities so fast that most of the smart cities are empty
 in smarton kaa ab naam badal gaya he
 They are being called Ghost or City
 kya nahin he vahaan, bas aadmi nahin he
 On the basis of technology, the city's capacity will be developed, but will the city remain a city? bahut saare sawaal hai smart city ko lekar
 There are political questions as well as economic ones

 He said, "the SP could not get its votes transferred to the BSP
" sapa kaa buniyadi aadhaar maane jane vaale yadavon ne basapa ke ummidavaaron vaali zyaadaatar siton par bhaajapa ko vot diya
 Mayawati also announced that the BSP will contest the by-elections in 11 assembly seats vacated after the Lok Sabha elections
 basapa ke ek kshetreey koordinator kehete hai, ''samiksha baithak main basapa netaaon kii raay thi ki party un loksabhaa siton par kamjor ho gai he jahaan usne chunaav nahin ladaa or isaki vajah se uske bade netaa congress yaa bhaajapa main chale gaye
 After the 2012 assembly elections, Mayawati had announced that the BSP will not contest any by-elections in the coming days
 lekin vidhayakon ke saansad banane ke baad rikt huin 11 vidhansabha siten or hatya ke maamle main bhaajapa vidhayak ashoka chandel ke jail jane se khaali hui hamirpur seat par hone vaale upachunaav ladgaye kii ghoshnaa kar mayawati ne ek nayaa daanv chalaa he
 Out of these 12 seats, the BSP won the Jalalpur assembly seat of Ambedkar Nagar in the 2017 assembly elections and the party finished second in Tundla, Iglaas, Balha assembly seats
 pashchimi upi main basapa ke ek jonal koardinator bataate hai, ''vidhansabha upachunaav ladgaye kaa nirnay kar bahan ji basapa ke cader ko active karnaa chaahati hai
 They will also know in which direction the party's preparations for the 2022 assembly elections are going
 ''vidhansabha upachunaav main sanghathan kii dakshata jaanchane ke liye mayawati ne isamen badlaav kiya he
 Mayawati has removed the existing district and assembly in-charge, leaving the bsp's district organization
 basapa sanghathan ke lihaaj se upi ko chaar hisson main baant kar prayek main sector incharge tainaat kiye gaye hai
 Through these sector in-charge, the BSP will directly monitor the activities of the party, as well as the coordination between the top leadership of the party and the zonal coordinator
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad nai dilli ke kendriya karyaalay main yojit baithak main party netaaon ne kai jonal koardinater kii shikaayat kii thi
 Three of the 10 BSP mps who won this time are Muslims
 party kii vaapasi kii ranneeti kaa ek ahm pahalu yah he ki sapa ke bajaae musalamaanon ke liye basapa khud ko zyada bharosemand vikalp ke taur par pesh karnaa chaahati he
 The BSP, which is suffering the brunt of expelling Nasimuddin Siddiqui from the party in 2017, is preparing a new line of Muslim leaders
 isaki shuruyaat amroha ke saansad danish ali ko loksabhaa main party kaa mukhya sachetak niyukt karne ke saath ho chuki he
 Ali has special support from the Muslims of Western UP
 basapa ke aligarh ke prabharee munkad ali ko lakhanu, bareli, kanpur, jhaansi or chitrakoot kaa prabharee bhi bana diya gaya he
 "muslims have expressed confidence in the BSP in the Lok Sabha elections," he says
 party kaa makasad aane vaale chunaavon main bhi unka samarthan banaae rakhana he
 After about 15 years, the BSP has elected a Dalit leader Girish Chandra as its leader in the Lok Sabha
 jonpur ke saansad shyaam singh yadav ko nichle sadan main upanetaa banaaya gaya he
 "mayawati is trying to show that Yadav is not standing as firmly behind the SP as the Dalits are with the BSP," says Ajit Kumar, professor in the sociology department at Banaras Hindu University
 dalit-yadav sameekaran banane kii jugat main ve yah dekhnaa chaahati hai ki kya ve sapa ke gathbandhan se baahar rahakar yadav voton ko apni taraf khinch sakati hai
 "A major setback for the BSP has been that such leaders of backward castes also left the party, which was prepared by the founder of the party, Kanshi Ram
" purvi upi ke purv party koordinator rakesh singh kehete hai, ''loksabhaa chunaavon se pataa chal gaya he ki basapa gaiyr-jatav daliton or sabase pichhadi jatiyon ke bich samarthan kho rahi he
 Mayawati has opened the doors for former leaders desirous of returning to the party
 ve booth str kii 'bhaichara' cametiyon ko bhi do maheenon ke bheetar phir se khadaa karnaa chaahati hai
 Earlier these committees were active only before the elections
 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav 2022 main hone hai, par mayawati ko lag rahaa he ki vakt teji se niklaa ja rahaa he
 Mayawati, who is contesting the general election in alliance with SP-RLD, may be saying that the BSP is at a disadvantage in the election, but the figures suggest the opposite (see graphics)
 mayawati ko bhi iskaa bhaan he, so upachunaav ladgaye kii ghoshnaa karte vakt unhone akhilesh yadav kii tarif kii
 In fact, he has kept open the possibility of joining hands with the SP in the 2022 assembly elections

 com / odih0n4jqn — geeta phogat (@geeta_phogat) December 1, 2019 The wedding took place on Sunday in a very simple way

 However, today i
e
 on December 2, a program has been organized by both sides in Delhi
 is kaarykram main pradhanmantri narendra modi, grih mantri amit shah, kendriya mantriyon ke alaava mukhyamantri manohar laal sahit anek netaaon, desh or videsh ke pahalawaanon ke aane kii ummid he
 Let me tell you that for nearly 5 years, there was a friendship between Babita Phogat, a resident of village Balali in Charkhi Dadri district and Vivek Suhag of Najafgarh living in West Delhi
 bataaya jaataa he ki donon kii mulaakaat dilli ke taj hotel main yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan hui thi
 Their meeting turned into love
 iske baad donon ne apane-apane parivaar se apane rishte ke bare main bataaya or shaadi karne kii ichha jataai
 On June 2, the families of both of them said yes to marriage
 iske baad 1 disambar ko shaadi ke bandhan main bandha gaye
 The time has come for the FBI team to visit Pakistan to investigate the Mumbai attack
 pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa abdul vashisht ne jaankaree di he ki epabiai kii team 4 march ko pakistan pahunch rahi he
 The FBI team coming to Pakistan will also include FBI Director Robert Mueller
 epabiai kii team kaa pakistan pahunchnaa bharat ke liye kaaphi ahm hai
 It would be impossible for Pakistan to falsify the evidence of the FBI, and to defeat Pakistan, the Mumbai attack would have to be investigated
 padmavati dilachasp he
 Not only the film, but also the uproar about it
 is tarah ke yuddh ke drishy, shashakt bhashaa or bich-bich main hasya ne is film kaa muft main pramotion kiya he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali did not have to spend on promotion
 rajasthan ke distributors ne rajput samaaj ke virodh ke baad bhansaali kii is madhyayugin kahani ke pradarshan se inkaar kar diya he
 Now politicians have also jumped into it
 itnaa hi nahin, is film ne gujarat ke bhaajapa or congress netaaon ko bhi ek kar diya he, ve film ke editing kii maang kar rahe hai
 They do not want this to hurt the sentiments of the Rajputs
 apni bahaduree ke liye pahachaane jane vaale rajput daawa kar rahe hai ki unki bhavanaaen aahat hai, kyonki film main allaudin khilji ke kirdaar ko maharani padmamini ke bare main sochate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 The makers have clarified that there is no scene in this type of thinking
 trailor launch ho chukaa he
 It is less about Khilji and more about the bravery, sacrifice and justice of Rajputs
 is puure maamle main sunishchit nahin kiya gaya he, sirf anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki film bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne vaali he
 Now the question in such a situation is what is wrong with Padmavati? Looking at all the evidence, we can safely say that it is the choice of energy-rich actor Ranveer Singh, who chose Alauddin Khilji
 ranvir singh saamanyat: villen ke role ke liye nahin bane hai
 They are not Shakti Kapoor, Raza Murad, Amrish Puri, Prakash Raj, Ashish Vidyarthi or Ashutosh Rana, who have been accepted by the people as villains
 hamaara samaaj cinema ko gambhirtha se letaa he
 Ranveer Singh is the hero material
 ve star hai
 Indeed, his fear is that he will become attractive after playing the character of Khilji by Ranveer
 ye kisi blike and white bollywood film ke paaramparik kirdaar kii tarah nahin he
 Ranveer will make it all 'gray' and Rajput will not accept it as usual
 khilji barbar nahin tha, jaisaa ki trailor main dikhaaya gaya he
 He may be a tough and cultured emperor, but the history written by his contemporaries describes him as extremely cruel, full of religious blindness and a murderer of thousands, not even leaving women and children
 rajputon kaa maananaa he ki khilji ko maanviya bataanaa un hajaaron rajputon kaa apmaan he, jinhen isliye maar diya gaya, kyonki unhone khilji ke adhipaty ko sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 Is this the reason? This is the reason
 or doosraa he bhaawanaaon ke aahat hone ke khel kii daud
 Do we need a list of films that got in trouble for this reason, because it did not show caste and community properly
 ye sirf pahchaan or rachanaatmakataa ko kaabo main karne ke liye he
 Previous governments and opposition have been involved in this game
 rajput is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki aage jaakar samjhauta hoga
 There will be some short cuts in the film and it will be a warning to Bollywood to keep history away, because our history is different

 The questions related to NRC asked in the Rajya Sabha during the Question Hour, Home Minister Amit Shah answered all the questions related to NRC
 The minister has hit back at Amit Shah
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki ham enarasi ko bengal main nahin lagu hone denge
 He said that no one can take away citizenship of any person living in Bengal
 ham hindu or muslimon ke aadhaar par nahin baantate hai
 In fact, while making a statement in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Amit Shah said that the process of NRC was taken up in Assam
 enarasi kii prakriya jab puure desh main hogi to assam main enarasi kii prakriya phir se kii jaaegi
 People of any religion need not be afraid
 rajyasabha main prashnkaal ke dauraan enarasi ke sambandh main tamaam sawaal puche gaye jinka jawaab grih mantri amit shah ne diya
 During the discussion, the Home Minister also clarified the difference between the National Citizen Register (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Bill
 rashtriya naagarik register se jude saiyad nasir hossain ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki logon ko enarasi or citigenship amendament bill ko lekar kanfusion he
 There is no provision inside NRC that people of other religions should not be taken on the register
 sabhi dharmon ke logon ko isamen liya jayega jo bharat ke naagarik hai
 There is no question of discriminating on the basis of religion
 enarasi ek alag prakiya he or citigenship amedament bill ek alag prakriya he
 The Home Minister further said that the NRC process in Assam was taken up under the Supreme Court
 enarasi kii prakriya jab puure desh main hogi to assam main enarasi kii prakriya phir se kii jaaegi
 People of any religion need not be afraid

 The gadget notification mentioned is applicable across the country
 ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main grih mantri ne kaha ki enarasi or citigenship amedament bill alag-alag chijen hai
 But the government believes that Hindu refugees who have come, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Christians and Parsis are refugees
 Refugees from all religions who come from outside should get citizenship

 Apart from this, permission has to be obtained from Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to play in any country
 gauratlab he ki navaj sharif pisibi ke sangrakshak bhi hai
 Sharif told the PCB yesterday that the Pakistan cricket team does not need to go to India to play

 The possibility of a series was strengthened for the last few days, but PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan made it clear that there is no question of the Pakistani team visiting India for the series
 bisisiai adhyaksh shashaank manohar ne pichley shanivaar ko shehryaar ko phone karke toornament kaa aayojan bharat main karne kaa prastaav rakhkar unsesarkaar se anumati lene ke liye kaha tha
 But Shaharyar clarified that this series is only possible if India play in the UAE where Pakistan have been playing their home matches since 2009 after the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore
 shehryaar ne crickinfo se kaha, ‘bharat main khilne kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 i am still waiting for the reason of not playing in the UAE
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham 2007 or 2012 main vahaan gaye
 This will not happen again

 Isn't this too much ego? The responsibility of updating the slogan was left to the Prime Minister, leaving the space next to nationalism, and the next day the name of the late leader of the party was added to the final format of the slogan - Ajeya Bharat, Atal BJP
 party adhyaksh shah ne pehle twit kiya tha—ajey bharat, ajey bhaajapa
 But later it was deleted and added to it
 abhi yahi naaraa he, jab tak ki koi nayaa naaraa nahin aata

 There is a dispute in Karnataka this year to celebrate Tipu Sultan Jayanti
 karnataka main vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi bijepi or aresas ne aayojan na hone dene kii baat kahi he
 Last year, two people died in violence erupted in Kurg to celebrate the birth anniversary
 pichley saal kii tarah is saal bhi 10 november ko siddharmaiya sarkaar 18veen sadi main mysore ke raja tipu sultan kii jayanti manaane ja rahi he, lekin aresas pichhali baar kii tarah is baar bhi ada hua he ki vah iskaa virodh karegaa
 He argues that Tipu Sultan got mass conversions
 kannada or culture department ne iske aayojan par 69 lakh ke kharch kii baat kahi he or isse judaa circular har jile ke sthaneey prashasan ko bhej diya gaya he
 Although, Kodagu district is known for its beautiful scenery and cold weather, but due to the event last year, this area became witness to violence and two people lost their lives in clashes
 vipaksh main kabiz bijepi tipu sultan ko ek kattar or hinsak raja ke rup main pesh karti ai he, jisane badi sankhya main hinduon or isaayiyon ko dharmantaran karavaaya
 In this matter, the RSS and its associated organizations have decided to agitate against it across the state
 iske liye bengalooru main 8 november ko badi raily bhi hone ja rahi he
 RSS activist v Nagaraj said that in 1886 Ghulam Mohammad, the grandson of Tipu Sultan, wrote a book on the lives of Hyder Ali Khan Bahadur and Tipu Sultan
 yah 1886 main chhapi thi or ise dobaaraa 1976 main chapa gaya
 In this, his grandson told what did not do for Tipu Sultan's Islam
 unhone 70 hajaar isaayiyon or 1 lakh hinduon kaa jabardastee dharmantaran karvaa diya
 Many Christian organizations and especially in the coastal areas of Karnataka have expressed their unhappiness about this event

 We will take care of law and order
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki aresas sampradayik he or ve nafrat failaane kii koshish karenge
 On the other hand, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge has also targeted the RSS
 unhone poocha he ki jab ve nathu ram godse kii jayanti manaa sakate hai to kya ham tipu sultan kii nahin
 Like last year, on 10 November this year, the Siddaramaiah government is going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Tipu Sultan, the king of Mysore in the 18th century, but the RSS is adamant that it will oppose it like last time
 uski daleel he ki tipu sultan ne bade paimaane par dharmantaran karaayaa
 The Kannada and Culture Department has said to spend 69 lakhs on its organization and the circular attached to it has been sent to the local administration of every district

 He forced 70 thousand Christians and 1 lakh Hindus to convert

 By the way, the state government, which has faced criticism over poor law and order situation last year, is looking fully prepared this time

 dhara 370 ke tahat kashmir ko jo visheshadhikaar milte the, wo ab nahin mil paaenge
 In such a situation, a lot will change in the valley now
 algaavvaadi ab zyada kuch nahin kar paaenge, saath hi agar pakistan kashmir masale par adnga lagaana bhi chahega to use sidhe taur par centre sarkaar se baat kerani hogi
 What used to happen before
 
 
 darasal, bharat kaa rukh kashmir ke masale par hameshaa ek hi rahaa he ki vah pakistan se tabhi baat karegaa jab aatankwaad ke khilaaf ection liya jayega
 But in spite of this, whenever India and Pakistan came to any stage on any issue, the separatists created a closed atmosphere in the valley and performed in different places with the support of the state government
 lekin ab jammu-kashmir ek centre shasit pradesh ban jayega yani vahaan kii kanoon vyavastha sidhe taur par kendriya grih mantralay ke haath main hogi
 The central government has already been strict on the separatists, so with this new rule, the difficulties for the separatists will increase
 pakistan pehle kai baar algaavvaadiyon se baat karne kii baat kah chukaa he
 The Pakistani High Commissioner also used to invite the feast to the separatists on every issue, but now it will be difficult to do so
 ab kya hoga
 
 -jammu-kashmir main algaavvaadiyon kii sthiti kamjor hogi
 Regional parties also will not be able to impose much constraints on the decision of the Center
 -jammu-kashmir kii kanoon vyavastha sidhe taur par kendriya grih mantralay ke haath main hogi, yani algaavvaadiyon or patharbaajon ke liye ab mushkil badhati hi jaaegi
 -pakistan will have to talk directly on this issue if it has to talk on this issue and somehow the separatists will not be able to impose their constraints on this issue
 -kyonki ab UAPA bill lagu ho gaya he, aise main jo bhi vyakti aatankwaadiyon kii madad karne kii koshish karegaa to NIA sidhe taur par un par shikanja kas paaegaa
 Earlier, it has been seen many times that the state government, through its police, used to give relaxation to the stonemasons and made it difficult for the army
 lekin ab jab centre ke haath main rajya kii police hogi to ye mushkilen bhi dur ho paaengi
