 hindustan ke nakshe main bana ye gaddha hamen is baat kaa ahsaas kara rahaa he ki saalon se hamane sirf shikaayatein kii hai
 But learned nothing
 yahi vajah he ki har saal naa jane kitne hi bachche in gaddhon main ja girte hai
 Some escape from these dark pits, and some die
 do- chaar din shor hota hai
 Then we all forget
 tab tak jab tak ki aglaa koi gadde main naa gir jaae
 And this time it was Sana's turn of three years
 sanaa zamin ke neeche 110 feet gahare gadde main thi
 She kept swinging between life and death for several hours
 'mujhe yahaan se nikaalo maa'bas ek feet chaudaa ghup andhera gaddha or us gaddhe main 110 feet neeche fansi us maa kii 3 saal kii maasoom bacchee
 She is sometimes afraid inside
 kabhi ghabraati he
 Sometimes she starts crying
 baar baar kahati jaati he
 Mommy please get me out
 yahaan bahut dar lag rahaa he
 What should that forced mother also do
 110 feet gahare gaddhe se apane jigar ke tukade ko nikaale bhi to nikaale kaise
 When nothing is understood, then she starts comforting her child by inserting her mouth in this pit
 beti ko tasalli detii rahi mambaar-baar kahati he beti ghabraana nahin ham yaheen hai
 with you
 tumhen kuch nahin hone denge
 Will take it out ham yaheen hai
 But as soon as no sound is heard from the pits for a while, this helpless mother would run towards the TV screen in which the picture of CCTV is seen
 tasviir dekhati to tasalli milti
 But then as soon as the baby girl who was seen on TV stopped acting, this mother would start folding her hands in front of journalists
 bas ek guzarish karti kuch bhi karo
 Howsoever meri bacchee ko bachaa lo
 The closed circuit camera has been inserted inside the surveillance hole with CCTV camera, this scene is visible
 borwell ke liye khoda gaya gaddha
 In which half of the place is surrounded by this pipe which drains water
 or baaki bachi jagah main simati hui ye bacchee he
 Only the gumbs in the fingers of the hand are indicating that the girl is still alive
 varanaa puraa jism keechad main is tarah sanaa hua he ki samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki sir kahaan or pair kahaan
 Oxigen inserted in Boring 3-year-old innocent Sanaa fell into this borewell at Munger in Pipebihar at around 3pm on Tuesday and since then the whole family has gathered near this borewell and outside the neighboring house
 prashasnic amale ne bhi puri mustaidi dikhaai or fouran maukey par pahunch kar borwell main oxizan pipe pahunchaai gai taaki sanaa kii saansen chalati rahen
 Medicines and water were also being given continuously
 sanaa kii awaz thami to gharavaalon kii sansedin to rote peetate or fariyaad karte karte biit gaya
 But when night came, mother started getting more nervous
 bacchee ko raatbhar jagaae bhi nahin rakhana chaahati thi
 And did not even want to sleep
 kyonki 110 feet neeche borwell main agar sanaa kii awaz tham jaati, to idhar gharavaalon kii saanse thamane lagatee
 Mother's mother was crying and crying, Sana's mother was crying and crying
 apni beti ko hausala dilaane ke liye wo har mumkin jatan raatbhar karti rahi
 She kept comforting the girl every once in a while
 ghabraana nahin sanaa ham yaheen hai
 Somehow last night and on Wednesday morning, and then the operation to remove the girl from the borewell started
 110 feet neeche fansi thi sanasana kii jindagi ab police, prashasan or rescue team ke rahamo-karam par thi
 NDRF, SDRF and Army were on the spot
 ab is team ko jameen ke neeche 110 feet gahare gadde main utarana tha
 But there had to be a way to get down and there was no road
 lihaaja hemsha kii tarah pehle rasta banaaya gaya or ye rasta bana sadak ko khod kar
 This is how the rescue operation started
 On the morning of Budhwar, the initiative of the army and administration started growing in the Murgiachak locality of Munger
 behad ghanaa ilaaka hone kii vajah se rescue team ke paas iske sivaa or koi rasta nahin tha ki is sadak ko hi khodakar ghar kii us jagah tak pahunchaa jaae jahaan sanaa neeche fansi hui thi
 The work of digging the road through the JCB machine had started at night
 magar subah hote hote ye kaam yuddh str par chalane gaya
 Several teams together dug a long wide pit on the road in a few hours
 sabase pehle sidhi gaharaai karte hue sadak par gaddha banaaya gaya or phir vahaan se samtal tunnel taiyaar kii gai jisase sanaa tak pahunchaa ja sake
 Although this excavation encountered many problems, the team of NDRF and SDRF gave their full strength to save Sana
 kabr banane waalon ne khoda gaddhabehad ghanaa ilaaka hone or tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood paralal channel banane kaa kaam aasaan nahin tha
 If there is no scope for any mistake, the administration also engaged the workers who dig the graves in the rescue work
 kyonki ye majdoor tarateeb se gaddhe khodne main maahir hote hai
 There was a great surprise in Munger, Bihar
 abhi tak maut ke baad kabr khodate rahe haath aaj jindagi ke liye gadde khod rahe the
 The whole force was put in to save Sanaa, the camera was continuously on inside the ground
 usee camere se dikh rahaa tha ki sanaa 35 feet kii gaharaai main boring ke liye daale gaye plastic ke pipe main fansi he
 According to the artisans doing boring work in the house, the pit in which Stana was trapped was made 220 feet deep for boring
 jisamen kareeb 125 feet tak grabul bhi daalaa ja chukaa tha
 So to reach Sana, the rescue team will have to take a lot of precaution or else Sana can go downwards
 is bich puure ilaake ko takreeban thap kar ke sari koshish sanaa ko bachaane main laga di gaikhoda gaya samanaantar gaddhasham 5 baje tak rescue team 45 feet vertical yani sidhaa gaddha or phir horigental yani samanaantar gaddha khodakar sanaa ke bilkul nazadik pahunch chuki thi
 The last time took more time because the parallel pit was dug
 usamen ek vakt main ek hi aadmi khudaai kaa kaam kar saktaa tha
 There was neither a place to dig a deep pit here nor was it the best effort according to the administration
 
 
 
 And the innocent's life was saved
 shaam hote-hote rescue team sanaa se saat feet kii duuri tak pahunch jaati he
 Now there was a need to take more precaution from here
 kaam dhimaa ho jaataa he
 Then slowly - slowly the two hands of life reach Sana's hands
 or kariban 30 ghante baad sanaa ko bachaa liya jaataa he
 And thus the efforts of the army, NDRF, SDRF and local administration succeeded
 sanaa kii jindagi bachaa lee gai

 unhone abhinayta salmaan khan ko bari kiye jane par sawaal uthaaya he
 Government lawyer Sandeep Kumar Shinde said that they would soon send a recommendation against the decision of Salman Khan's release to the government
 unka kahana he ki is maamle ke mukhya gavaah consteble ravindra patil or sabooton ko bombai hai court kaise andekha kar saktaa he
 Patil died in the year 2007, but earlier he had given a statement before the magistrate that Salman was driving drunk on the day of the incident
 satr adaalat ne patil ke bayaan ko aadhaar banaakar hi salmaan ko 5 saal kii sajaa kaa aadesh diya tha
 At the same time, Justice Joshi of the Bombay High Court said that Patil was not a fully credible witness and the sessions court's reliance on Patil's statement was 'wrong in law'
 bombai hai court ne ullekh kiya tha ki ravindra patil kaa bayaan us vakt darj kiya gaya tha jab abhinayta salmaan khan par laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 There was a charge of culpable homicide against Salman, Patil's statement did not increase it
 phir uski maut ho jane ke baad bade maamle main uskaa bayaan darj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Shinde will submit the report to the Law and Judiciary Department on Friday
 iske baad maharashtra sarkaar shanivaar bombai hai court ke aadesh ke khilaaf apil par faisla le sakati he

 filmkaar muzaffar ali niraash hai
 The filmmaker, who made the classic 'umrao Jaan' with Rekha in 1981, is worried about his new film period drama 'janisar'
 parnia khureshi or pakistani abhinayta imran abbaas starer 'jaanisar' ko release ke liye screen nahin mil rahe hai
 The result is that Muzaffar Ali had to change the film release date
 muzaffar ali chaahate the kii film swatantraaa diwas ko release karen kyonki film us jamaane kii he, lekin date pehle se hi cinema holls main karan johar ne book kar rakhi he apni film 'bros' ke liye
 After this, Muzaffar Ali thought of releasing the film on August 21 and then came to the fore with Umesh Shukla's Abhishek bachchan-rishi Kapoor starrer 'all Is Well'
 tippaniyan Muzaffar Ali is now determined to release 'janissar' on 7 August itself
 unhone kaha, 'main bade bajet kii shor sharabe vaali multi starer filmon se kaise muqabla kar saktaa hum
 People like 'killa', 'masaan' and films of small filmmakers like me, but do not get the hall
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii period drama 'baaji raav mastaani' se tulana par 70 saal ke muzaffar ali ne kaha, maine 'jaanisar' 54 dinon main banaai vahiin 'baaji raav mastaani' 300 din main bani he

 Big budget big promotion

 In the era of Bahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the biggest challenge for small filmmakers is to get their films to the audience

 Muzaffar Ali wanted the film to be released on Independence Day as the film was of that era, but the date is already booked in cinema halls by Karan Johar for his film 'brothers'

 He said, 'how can i compete with multi-starrer films with big budget noise
 'killa', 'masaan' or mere jaise chote filmkaar kii filmein log pasand to karte hai, lekin haul nahin milte
 Comparing Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama 'baji Rao Mastani', 70-year-old Muzaffar Ali said, 'I made' Janissar 'in 54 days while' Baji Rao Mastani 'was made in 300 days

 ghare bire aaj ke bare main sen kahati hai ki unhen sapana aayaa tha: ‘‘sapane main unhone ek aadmi ko dekha jo pehali baar ek samakaleen setting main ghare bire par ek film bana rahaa he
 i woke up from sleep and realized that the man was probably me
 bhale hi vah ek aadmi tha or yah meri pehali film nahin, phir bhi vah main hi thi kyonki har film pehali film hoti he
 "she says that her film based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel Ghare Byre (home and World) is very different from Satyajit Ray's film on the same novel in 1984, because she made it today and the character is" different - Different backgrounds represent '' (bengali, Bihari, Brahmin, Dalit), while the original novel has its background during the Swadeshi movement in pre-independence Bengal
 74 varshiya sen bengal main puuje jane vaale tagore or re kii kritiyon se muqabla kar rahi hai, lekin unhen koi ghabrahat nahin
 "I believe that these 'gods' are part of my heritage, so i have every right to touch their creations

 So what parts have they left? She says, "I had decided this time not to see Satyajit Ray's house
 kai saal pehle maine ek baar vah film dekhi thi
 i do not want to copy it
 haalanki, maine upanyaas ko kai baar padhaa he, taaki main kah sakuun ki meri film ek saahitiyik kriti kaa cinemai sanskaran he
 "most of his films also show shades of political polarization
" jawaab main sen kahati hai ki aaj har ghar main vaicharik matbhed pravesh kar chukaa he
 "I feel it even among my friends, ideologies are completely divided even within the family
" is baar apane bijoya lunch par hamane faisla kiya tha ki rajnatik charchaa nahin karenge
 Our film shows how politics has slowly spread to every corner of our life
 ’’sen ne ghare bire aaj ko gauri lankesh ko samarpit kiya he, kyonki unka maananaa he ki ‘‘vah ek udaarpanthi thi jise khamosh kar diya gaya
 No voice should be silenced
 main bahut dukhi thi
 "in July this year, Sen and a group of celebrities sent an open letter to the Prime Minister on the increasing number of violent incidents of mob
 nateeja yah hua ki unke khilaaf rajdroh kaa aarope madh diya gaya
 But they did not panic
 is film nirmaataa kaa kahana he ki vah darane vaali nahin he
 "I have nothing to hide
" har koi jaanata he ki main vampanthi-udaaravaadi hum
 But i would also like to make it clear that i am not associated with any political party
 maine kabhi bhi kisi bhi party se koi uphaar yaa ehsaan yaa ek inch bhi jameen nahin lee

 Sen said that once he was sent to interview a CPI (M) leader
 ve bataati hai, ‘‘dharm kii baat uthi to unhone kaha ki chauraahey par ek mandir he jise ve tod sakate hai
 Then i asked him, "is this the reason why the Left is losing its connection with the people?" As a journalist and filmmaker, Sen says he made it his business to understand the opposition
 ‘‘dakshinpanthi vichaardhaara maanati he ki aap is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate ki bharat mulat: ek dharmik desh he
 Communists may believe what they believe, but they cannot deny the fact that ordinary people here are of a deeply religious tendency
 dharm kaa istemaal vibhaajan ke bajaae ekajute hone ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 "look at monotheism in Hinduism," says Sen, which means no one else and everyone is part of the divine
 isi tarah, islam main bhi sufiwaad khubasurat sandesh detaa he
 According to Aparna Sen, politics breathes in every person whether he thinks so or not
 ve maanati hai ki unki pehle kii filmein zyada strivadi thim
 But Arshinagar (2015) and Mr and Mrs Iyer (2002) and now Ghare Bire today featured elements of communalism
 ‘‘meri dilchaspee yah dikhaane main he ki baahar kii raajnneeti kaise ghar ke andar ke rishton ko prabhavit karti he

 Misbah says Australia do not have quality spinners and this is their weakness
 unka kahana he ki sidney main spinneron ne hameshaa acha khel dikhaaya he
 The pan of India is heavy here
 misbah ne udhaaharan dete hue bataaya ki imran taahir ne vahaan kaaphi acchhee gendbaaji kii thi
 He troubled the batsmen and took 4 wickets for 26 runs while the second spinner Duminy took 3 wickets for 29 runs
 unhone kaha ki australia ke paas dhang ke spinner nahin hai jabaki bharat ke paas hai
 This is the reason why Australians want that pitch to have some grass so that its fast bowlers can harass the Indians
 pakistan ke khilaaf match ke baad australian captain clark ne bhi kaha tha ki bharat ke khilaaf semifinal match ek chalange he
 At the same time, he also made it clear that depending on the mood of the Sydney pitch, there will be spin or bowling
 unhone kaha, ‘pich par ghaas hone kii sthiti main nishchit taur par hamaare bolers ko madad milegi, spin wicket mila to bhi hamaare paas bolers hai
 On the other hand, many former Pakistan cricketers believe that India will win this semi-final

 ’yah puche jane par ki kya vah sochate hai ki hedli america ke liye lashkar-e-tayba yaa anya aatankwaadi samoohon ke bare main soochna kaa strot tha to pillai ne kaha, ‘aisa ho saktaa he
 We do not know if David Headley was the source for America
 yah baat america sarkaar ne kabhi nahin kaha ki vah uske liye strot tha
 Pillai said, "as far as we are concerned, he was a man of lashkar-e-tayyaba and he played an important role in planning the attack on India and had access to the top lashkar-e-taib office bearers

 kyonki bharat hamaara samrik saajheedaar or mitra he or usase ham niyamit tathaa lagaataar khufia jaankaree saajha kar sakate hai
 'romer said,' so India could interrogate Headley and ask him what happened before Mumbai
 hamen is baat kaa dar nahin he ki vah kya kahegaa
 Rather, we gave India a chance to ask whatever it wanted
 ’bharat lagaataar kah rahaa he ki america ne vishisht soochna nahin di or 26 november ke hamale pehle sirf aam soochna di
 Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao had said, "in the last few months when the Headley case came up, we interacted with the US authorities in the investigation and exchanged information
 26 / 11 ke pehle hamaare paas in dhamkiyon or khataron ke bare main bahut saamaanya jaankaree se zyada kuch bhi nahin tha
 According to some reports, Headley's two wives told the FBI about a year before the Mumbai attacks that he was plotting attacks in India while working with Lashkar

 The fifth decision is going to attract the youth

 The first bet in candidate selection The Congress won the election process in Odisha

 The Congress handed over the state leadership to Niranjan Patnaik and made him the favorite team
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne 21 loksabhaa kshetron or teen jilon ke 21 vidhansabha kshetron ke prabhariyon se pratyaashee chayan par feedback liya

 The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday accused the government of delaying the investigation into the parvipip helicopter deal and sought to find the bottom of the scam so that the bribe takers could be punished
 raksha mantralay dwaara kharide gaeviviipi helicopterpar rajya sabha main sankshipt charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue bhaajapa ke prakaash javdekar ne aarope lagaaya ki is saude ke liye 400 karod rupye rishwat main di gai
 He said that the country wants to know the name of 'family' mentioned in the document of Italian investigators
 javdekar ne aarope lagaaya ki saude main anek bichauliyon sahit guido ralf haschake, carlo vailenshio ferdinando gerosa or christian mishael dallali kii rakam le chuke hai
 Part of the money was sent to India through the back door
 unhone kaha ki 'kaise bhrashtachar' hua yah pataa lagane ke liye italy ne jaanch shuru kii
 The country has benefited from the Rs
 3600 crore 12 VVIP helicopter purchase deal
 javdekar ne kaha ki ve tathakthith rishwat ke mudde ko sansad ke sheet satr main bhi uthaa chuke hai lekin sarkaar ne kaha ki usne abhi aupchaarik jaanch shuru nahin kii he
 He said the government was able to order an inquiry only after the arrest of Guiseppi Orci, the former CEO of Italian company Finmeccanica
 agasta westland finamekkanika kii sahaayak company he
 Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati said that apart from a joint parliamentary committee inquiry into the helicopter deal, a CBI inquiry should also take place

 The deal to buy VVIP 12 AW 101 chopper was done in 2010

 His own perceived micromanagement backfired
 apane 'chahete' adhikariyon ko pramukh padon par baitaane kii modi kii fitrat varisht naukarshahon ko ab raas nahin aa rahi
 The battle may be sharper as a clash is brewing in the Enforcement Directorate (ED), intelligence services and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) like CBI
 jab modi ko kisi pad ke liye 'makul shaks' nahin miltaa, to ve dusron ko baari se pehle padonnati de dete hai
 For example, Sanjay Kumar Mishra has been made the interim head of the ED for three months
 piemo main ucch adhikariyon ke kareebi bataae jane vaale mishra abhi atirikt sachiv ke rup main soochibadgh bhi nahin hue the, jisase unhen pad atirikt kaarybhaar ke rup main hi sanbhaalanaa jaruri ban gaya
 Similarly, after the departure of CBI Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana, M
R
 became the interim head of the agency
 nageshwar raav bhi niyukti ke vakt soochibadgh nahin the
 In media reports, he was described as a 'modi's beloved' officer in the CBI quarrel
 raav ne kendriya grih sachiv ko agast main chitthee likhi ki mahanideshak ke pad par padonnati ke liye unke maamle ko dekh sarkaar kaa niyukt panel unke prati bhedbhaav barat rahaa he
 They allege that they are victims of mutual 'stalking' and 'constant, internal tussle' among their fellow officers of the Odisha cadre
 raav rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal or bhaajapa ke rashtriya sachiv ram madhav ke think tanks se bhi jude hai isliye padonnati ke liye kisi bhi visheshgy panel main aapattiyon par bees sabit hote hai
 The appointments of Mishra and Rao suggest that the government does not want to appoint uncomfortable officials to important posts before the general elections next year
 idi ke ritair ho chuke pramukh karnal singh, jinka kaarykaal pichley hakrate hi samaapt hua, bhi sibiai main asthana ke saath chhidi jang main apane puraane sahyogi verma ke saath khadey dikhe
 Verma has been his partner in the Delhi Police
 yahi vajah he ki karnal singh ko ritymerament ke baad koi sthaayee niyukti nahin mili
 He was earlier on a temporary deputation and was given two extensions before the Supreme Court intervened
 unhone apane dipti rajeshwar singh kaa samarthan karke bhi sarkaar ko naaraaz kar liya tha
 Rajeshwar Singh accused Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia of 'supporting the scamsters'

 Chidambaram and fugitive Nirav are trying to save Modi
 lekin verma ne agar asthana ke khilaaf aarope lagaae hai to asthana ne bhi verma par kai gambhir aarope madhe hai
 Rajeshwar Singh may have the support of Swamy to investigate the aircel-maxis case involving Chidambaram and his son Karti, but a disproportionate assets case is under investigation against him
 supreme court ne june maheene main unke khilaaf jaanch jari rakhane ko hari jhandi di thi
 Now Rajeshwar has also gone on a two-year study leave from the ED with the farewell of his boss Karnal Singh
 yani makadzaal ulajhata hi ja rahaa he
 The Prime Minister is said to have initiated bureaucratic reforms including steps to make officers' evaluation systems more transparent, intensive vigilance checks and mandatory retirement for erring officials
 lekin sarkaar apni jarurat ke keval 34 pratishat adhikariyon ke saath hi kaam kar rahi he
 The problem is exacerbated by Modi's appointment of Gujarat cadre officers or trusted officers of his inner circle

 Shiv Senas allegedly vandalized Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) 's Worli Ward office in South Mumbai after refusing to allow construction of Bal Thackeray memorial at Shivaji Park
 shivaji park main jahaan par bal thakare kaa antim sanskaar kiya gaya tha, us sthaan ko philhal shivasena asthaayee smarak ke rup main saheje hue he or usne is jagah ko khaali karne se bhi inkaar kar diya he
 The BMC has opposed any construction in Shivaji Park as illegal

 The Congress is opposing this proposal, saying that this proposal of Shiv Sena will tamper with the history of Mumbai
 is prastaav kaa virodh to takreeban har party kar rahi he, lekin emenes ke virodh ne thakare parivaar ke saath-saath, duusare logon ko bhi achraj main daal diya he
 At the same time, in view of the fierce opposition to this proposal, the Shiv Sena's oldest political friend, BJP is also shying away from speaking anything

 England are currently trailing 1-2 in the series and will have to win on Wednesday to keep their hopes alive in the series
 bel ne pisie stadium main team ke net satr ke baad kaha, 'pichley do maichon kii tulana main yahaan ke halaat adhik anukool honge
 a little wind is good, it will definitely help everyone
 ' unhone kaha, 'ummid karte hai ki agle kuch dinon main ham pehle vanade jaisaa pradarshan karke shrinkhalaa 2-2 se baraabar karne main safal rahenge
 Bell admitted that his team performed poorly in the last ODI in Ranchi where his team collapsed for just 155 runs after which India easily achieved the target
 england ke is salaami ballebaaj ne kaha, 'agar ham 150 ran banaate hai to bharat ko in halaat main koi chunauti nahin milegi
 We have to set the stage, our middle order is very powerful and destructive
 hamen aadhaar or manch kii jarurat he jisase madhya kram ke hamaare ballebaaj score aage badha saken

 Bell, however, does not think that being ahead in the series, India will have a bigger upper hand in Mohali

 On some of the umpire's decisions going against the team, Bell said, "I feel the same but you can't control it
" ise lekar koi shikawa nahin he
 We just did not play well enough
 beshak ham kharaab nirnay nahin chaahate lekin ham acha nahin khele
 The Mohali wicket is likely to help the bowlers and Bell said that this would put more responsibility on the batsmen to play with caution

 He said, "dhoni showed us in Kochi that it is difficult for bowlers to stop runs if there are wickets in the last 15 overs

 aakhir ek lambey intjaar ke baad teen antim ummidavaaron main se vaaman kendre ko rashtriya natya vidhyalay kaa nayaa nideshak chun liya gaya
 Vamana graduated from this school 27 years ago in 1984
 paas hote hi unke saamne do ofer aae
 One is to go abroad with a theater group and second to organize a workshop on folklore styles of Kerala
 unhone duusare ofer kaa chunaav kiya
 Like the famous story of Munshi Premchand, the hero of Idgah, Hamid, he knew that traveling abroad is like a broken glass toy, but the strength of his mastery in the arts of his earth will always be useful to him
 nateeja saamne he
 Today he has been given the responsibility of the top post of the apex drama training institute in the country

 and
 karant ke baad un gine-chune rangakarmiyon main hai, jinhone apni ek pukhta dwibhashi pahchaan banaai he
 Parallel to his superhit theatrical productions such as Jhulwa and Ranangan in Marathi, there is a long series of donkey baraat in Hindi and his directed productions till the rendition Jaanaman about a decade ago
 abhi dedh maheene pehle manchit unki bilkul taaja prastuti no sex plis ek hindi prahasan hi he
 His performance Piya Bawri, based on Bhasa's Sanskrit drama Madhyamvyayoga, has created a record of being staged in three languages — Hindi, English and Marathi — in a single day
 pachpan varshiya vaaman ke natya karm kii visheshta he uskaa anushaasan or uski sampoornataa
 Needless to say, his play takes shape in visual sounds
 unki natya prastutiyaan manch ke ek saaf-suthere vyakaran se banati hai
 In the drama Janmaan based on the lives of the eunuchs, they portray sensitive aspects of this unknown world in such a way that the viewer can feel the horrific reality of the people of this neglected community in a human way
 prastuti ke dauraan drishyon ke bich ke antaraal main bhi jheenguron kii dhwani sunai detii rahati he
 This variety is also seen in the total color work of Vamana, who imaginatively uses such a variety of tips and ingredients
 ve apni prastutiyon main bharat muni ke naatyashaastra ke sutron se lekar aadhunik theatre kii tarkeebon tak kaa istemaal karte rahe hai
 For example, in Piya Bawri, the Natyashastra appears to be merely symbolic
 unke mutabik, is sanskrit naatak main sanskrit saundaryashastra kii mahaj gandh bhar he or unhone parampara, sanrachana, bhangimaaon, lay aadi ke mul rup ko ek bilkul nae tarah se is prastuti main bartaa he
 The reason for doing this is: He introduced Hidimba, the heroine of Bhasa, from a completely different point of view in his adapted playwright
 vah prem kii raajnneeti, parivaar or sambandhon ko ek aadhunik stri ke nazariye se dekh paati he
 In the same sequence of Vamana's variety of rituals, his presentation on the life of the Devadasis, Jhulwa and the Greek classic Idipas etc
 can also be remembered
 naatak jaaneman se hindi main punarvaapasi karne vaale vaaman pehle rangakarmi hai jinhen rashtriya natya vidhyalay kaa manohar singh sammaan diya gaya
 In connection with his achievements, he has also been awarded the 2012 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award given this year
 rashtriya natya vidhyalay main aane tak ve mumbai vishvavidhyalay ke theatre department ke mukhiya ke rup main kaary karte rahe hai, jiske ve sansthaapak bhi hai
 With his skill, he has brought it to the select theatrical courses of the country today
 rashtriya natya vidhyalay main agar vaaman ke aagaman ko bhavishya kii ore ek nae prasthaan kii tarah dekha ja rahaa he to isaki kuch vajahen hai
 One reason is that since Ram Gopal Bajaj's directorship, the school has been a constant depravity and confusion in its condition and direction and Vamana is a visionary in the theater with a clear vision of recognizing the importance of non-genres
 Has been ve samakaleen theatre ke rashtriya paridrishy main na sirf niyamit chahalkadami karte rahe hai, balki unke paas ek samuchit rashtriya drushti bhi he, jo jaanati he ki is raashtra kii shuruyaat vastav main gaanv se hoti he

 In Kankhal's mythical Daksheshwar Mahadev temple, devotees are also thronging to perform Lord Shiva's Jalabhisheka
 mandir main shiv ke jalabhishek ke liye bhakton kii lambii qatari lagi he
 It is believed that Lord Shiva had taken Rudravatar on the day of Chaturdashi of Falgun month and on this day, there was also union of Shiva and Shakti
 isi liye is din ko kaaphi khaas mana jaataa he
 It is believed that on this day the worship of the naive Shiva fulfills all the wishes of the devotees
 vaise to har shivaratri khaas hoti he

 (3 / 3) After praising Atal Bihari Vajpayee a few days ago for targeting Narendra Modi, Congress today described this veteran BJP leader as India's weakest Prime Minister till date, while the opposition party has often been taunting Manmohan Singh
 
 congress pravaktaa sanjay jha ne apane twit main aarope lagaaya ki vaajapeyi ‘sabase kamjor’ pradhanmantri the, kyonki vah pakistan ke maamle main bharat kii seemaa or desh ke hiton kii hifaazat karne main naakaam rahe the
 He said that Vajpayee failed to address even Narendra Modi, whom he wanted to remove from the post of Chief Minister after the 2002 Gujarat riots
 unhone twit kiya ki ab tak ke sabase kamjor pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi hai, jo gujarat narsanhaar ko lekar modi ko barkhaast karnaa chaahate the,lekin unhone ghutane tech die
 The Congress spokesperson also slammed Vajpayee for the NDA government's failure to protect India's borders and interests against Pakistan
 jha ne twit kiya he, 'ab tak bharat ke sabase kamjor pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi rahe hai, jo pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko gale laga rahe the, jabaki 50 sainik kargil main apni jaan ganvaa chuke the
 "he said," General Musharraf spent one night on the Indian soil, while the Prime Minister's Office and the NDA were sleeping
 ' Significantly, in the midst of the electoral turmoil, Congress praised Vajpayee for attacking Modi and said that a man (modi) whom the bjp's strongest leader (vajpayee) wanted to remove from the post of Chief Minister in the wake of Gujarat riots, How can he be the party's prime ministerial candidate
 congress ne apni aadhikarik website par kaha tha ki bijepi kaa koi netaa vaajapeyi ke kad kaa nahin ho saktaa, jo party ke sansthaapak adhyaksh the
 Earlier on Sunday, BJP had said that the book written by Manmohan Singh's former media advisor is an official confirmation that he is the weakest Prime Minister

 However, in the meantime, the BJP has broken into the ranks of a Congress MLA and claimed the support of 32 mlas
 bijepi ke uttar purvi bharat ke prabharee ram madhav or himant biswa sharma ne rajyapal najma hepatulla ke saamne ek anaupchaarik shakti pradarshan main 32 vidhayakon kii parade karai
 These included Congress MLA Andro Shyam Kumar and Trinamool Congress MLA Ravindra Singh
 kai or vidhayakon ko jodne kaa daawaais dauraan rajbhavan ke baahar himant biswa sharma ne patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha, 'tiemasi se ravindra ji or congress ke shyaam kumaar ji ne hamen samarthan diya he
 Many more leaders will also come forward to support us
 aap log puch rahe the ki ham bahumat ke liye 31 vidhayak kaise jutaayenge, aap hamane 32 vidhayakon kaa samarthan dikhaa diya
 Earlier, Congress leader and caretaker Chief Minister Ibobi Singh had given a new twist to the story, claiming that the Congress had a majority
 ibobi singh ne bataaya ki 4 vidhayakon vaali neshnal pipuls party ne unhen samarthan jataayaa he
 He also issued a letter supporting the NPP
 ye patr neshnal pipuls party ke mahasachiv vivekraj ke naam se rajyapal ko likhaa gaya he
 In this letter dated March 12, our party has won four seats in the assembly elections and to form a new government in the state, we extend our support to the Congress Party, which has become the largest party

 ibobi ne rajyapal se congress ko sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 Ibobi said- Congress has become the largest party by winning the most seats, in such a situation, they should get the first chance to prove their majority
 kisi ko nahin mila bahumatadrasal manipur main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila he
 There are 60 assembly seats in Manipur
 congress 28 siten jitkar sabase badi party bani he
 While BJP has got 21 seats

 Congress needs 3 mlas to form the government

 He was never sentenced by any court
 ''mujhase pucho asal kahani'haalanki shekhar haji mastaan par film banaae jane ke khilaaf nahin hai
 In the notice, he wrote, 'he raised me since childhood but never forced me to change religion

 upi main agle saal chunaav hone hai or mulaayam ke kunbe main ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav removed Akhilesh Yadav from the party's state president and handed over the command to Shivpal Yadav, while the CM withdrew eight important portions from uncle Shivpal
 jab akhilesh cabinet se shivpal ke istife kii atakalein lagane lageen to unhone buudhvaar ko press conference kar saaf kar diya ki wo netaji yani sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke adeshon kaa paalan karenge
 He also said that there is only one boss in SP and that is Netaji
 kunbe main ghamaasan kii khabaron se mache bavaal par sienkhilesh yadav nebhi chuppi todi or kaha ki yah jhagada sarkaar main he, parivaar main nahin
 Akhilesh also said that some decisions have been taken at Netaji's behest, some by him (CM) himself
 is tarah shivpal kii manamanion par ankush lagaakar akhilesh ne saaf sanket de diya he ki wo khud kii chhavi vikaas kii raah par chalane vaale netaa kii bananaa chaahate hai jabaki party ke anya netaa jati aadhaarit raajnneeti karte aae hai
 Akhilesh is a leader of the masses and does not want to let the image of the party deteriorate
 shivpalane saifai main buudhvaar subah press conference main paanch badi baaten kahin
 Let's try to find out what their meaning is
 
 
 1
 We are with the leader who will decide
 patrakaron ne jab shivpal yadav se poocha ki kya wo akhilesh cabinet se istipha dene ja rahe hai, to unhone kaha ki pehle wo netaji se milenge or netaji jo nirnay lenge, wo uskaa paalan karenge
 When the Cold War between Shivpal and Akhilesh came to the surface, the SP chief controlled the damage
 mulaayam singh ne shivpal yadav kii patni ko phone kar bhai or bete ke bich sulah karaane ko kaha
 Perhaps this is the reason why speculations were being made after Tuesday's incident, Shivpal put a stop to it and said that it will be as Netaji would say
 2
 With SP and Netaji
 jab shivpal se poocha gaya ki 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav kiske netritv main ladaa jayega to unhone isapar chuppi saadh lee
 He said that the people of Uttar Pradesh are with Netaji and Samajwadi Party
 shivpal or mulaayam jab ek manch par hote hai to maahaul kaaphi khushnuma dikhaai detaa he lekin akhilesh or shivpal ke bich kii dooriyaan har saarvajanik manch par dikh jaati hai
 3
 mantralay lenaa siem kaa adhikaar he
 This arrogance has been going on for a long time in Mulayam clan
 2012 ke chunaav main sapa kii jeet hui to mulaayam ne betikhileshko satta saunp di
 At that time Shivpal himself wanted to become CM
 kaaphi maan-manouvval ke baad shivpal maan to gaye lekin media ke saamne aae to unhone saaf kar diya ki netaji hi mukhyamantri hai
 That is, Shivpal, who was the head of important departments in the state government's cabinet, never considered Akhilesh as his CM
 4
 Netaji will do what he says on the resignation of other ministries
 kareeb saadhe chaar pehle bhi shivpal ne netaji ke prati apni nishtha dikhaai thi or aaj bhi apni usee nishtha par wo kaayam hai
 It is clear that whatever Shivpal says or does, there is acceptance of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 yaa kahen to shivpal abtak na to mulaayam ke bina chale hai yaa aage chalenge
 5
 janata kii seva karenge or unke saath anyaay nahin hone duungaa
 Now, with just 6 months left for the elections in UP, Mulayam Singh has given responsibility of the organization to Akhilesh Se
 sapa mukhiya ko pataa he ki chunaav main utarane se pehle sanghathan kii majbootee jaruri he
 Shivpal is the leader of the organization and works at the local level to organize the party

 The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the plea of aarushi's mother Nupur Talwar in the Noida's famous Aarushi murder case

 The Supreme Court bench of Justice AK Patnaik and JS Khehar issued notice to the CBI after senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for Nupur Talwar, said that the CBI investigation had several flaws
 salve ne kaha ki pesh sabooton se pataa chalata he ki jaanch main khamiyaan hai
 The investigative agency has ignored several visible evidence
 yah bataate hue ki aarushi ke pita rajesh talwaar kaa baar-baar narco test or brain masping karaae jane par bhi unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila, salve ne kaha, "maa (noopur talwaar) par aarope lagaaya gaya he, jabaki unke khilaaf is tarah kaa koi saboot nahin he

 The Supreme Court had on 6 January 2012 rejected the plea of the Talwar couple, in which they had opposed to calling themselves the prime accused
 nyaayalay ne is dampati par mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati di thi
 The Talwar couple challenged the lower court's decision in the Supreme Court which ordered the CBI to make them the main accused

 In the recently released film 'dil Dhadakne Do', here are some special excerpts from the conversation with this star who is seen best: What would you like to say about the film 'dil Dhadakne Do'? If liked, 'dil Dhadakne Do' is one of those films
 dil se banaai gayi film log soongh lete hai
 Right now 'piku' and 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' have also been highly appreciated
 yah multistar film he, khud ko kahaan pate hai?mujhe nahin lagata kii rima kaagati or joya akhtar ne likhte vakt aisa sochaa hoga keemltistarar filmbanani he
 He created a story whose character is all of us
 ab star cast ko dekh kar aap multistarar kehete hai
 i was asked to do the film, the script looked good and did it
 film main camel mehara ke kirdaar aapaki asal jindagi se kitna mail khaataa he?camel mehara se main bilkul alag hum
 i am very fun and enjoy, so i am very different from this character in the film
 aapane 'ishwar' or 'mashaal' jaisi filmein bhi kii hai, kya aap khud ko industry main alag tarah kaa actor maanate hai?dekhiye jab bhi koi or actor sadak par yaa kahin ja rahaa hota he to log use uske naam se pukaarte hai jaise dev anand ja rahaa he, shahrukh ja rahaa he lekin mujhe hameshaa logon ne kabhi 'lakhan', 'munna', 'ishwar' ke naam se to kabhi 'mistar india' ke naam se pukaara he
 Sometimes it is also called 'A Jhakas'
 to sabakaa apana-apana andaaj he
 i have always played strong characters
 'taal', 'bivi number 1' jaisi filmein ko bhi maine isiilie chunaa
 i always change myself and keep experimenting
 sikhta rahata hum
 When people call you by your character, what is the reaction? i find myself very strong and high
 khushkismat samajhataa hum
 In those times, when you used to experiment on yourself like removing mustache or making a body, those things were not much publicized, nowadays it all becomes trend
 to un chizon kaa aapako koft hota he?ji us vakt bura lagata tha, kaaphi bura lagata tha
 During 'lamhe', when i was pulling my mustache, we called the press in the film, but no one came
 kisi ko fark nahin padataa tha
 But nowadays the same things are given due consideration
 ab mujhe acha lagata he
 You have worked with Dilip Kumar on one side, and today you are also working with young actors, how do you see these changes? Young old is nothing, only talent comes in handy
 kitne yang log hai jinhe kuch aata hi nahin
 Zoyakafi is talented so i am working
 main hameshaa jarurat ke hisaab se khud ko kirdaar main dhaal detaa hum
 Ever want to be a part of a biopic? If the story is good, i will definitely do it, i will not do anyone
 kuch acha product or kahani hogi to aane vaale dino main karuunga
 There is no thought like this at the moment
 film main paaltu kutta 'pluto mehara' bhi he, kya aap animal lover hai?main animal lover nahin hum lekin meri bachche jarur hai
 It's not that I'm ruthless, i just like watching anime
 kabhi koi aisi script aae ki aapako moonche nikaalani pade, to kya ab aap apni muchhen katwaayenge?nahin, ab nahin, is vakt mujhe lagata he ki nahin nikaaloongaa
 Do you feel insecure in the industry? No, it never happens, i am always ready for the character and the work
 meri taiyaari ke kaaran hi mujhamen aatmavishvaas rahata he
 i enjoy my work very much

 He said that spinners in Mumbai will get more turn and the situation may become more difficult for England, whose batsmen are technically weak despite being mentally strong
 ’ramij ne kaha, ‘bharat siries ke sabhi match jeet saktaa he
 i think the ball will take more turn in Mumbai
 ahmedabad kii pich main spinneron ke liye pes (teji) nahin thi
 Ask any spinner you need a pace to make it spin

 He said, "if England loses Mumbai Test then the ground will be clear for India
 bharat ke paas tab 4-0 se jeet darj karne, jise ham brownwaash kehete hai, kaa sunaharaa mauka hoga

 You must have seen the first test match
 usamen unhone jis tarah se vaapasi kii usase match romaanchak ban gaya tha
 At one time it did not seem like who would win or draw the match
 isse lagata he ki siries rochak hogi
 Rameez praised India's young players, especially Cheteshwar Pujara, who won the Man of the Match award for his unbeaten 206 in the first innings of the first Test and 41 not out in the second innings

 Rameez said that comparing Pujara to Rahul Dravid would not be good
 unhone kaha, ‘dravid se unki tulana jyaadati he
 Dravid himself was telling me while commentating that when he was Pujara's age, he was not as confident as he was
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah bharat kii asal jeet he ki vah nayaa khun cricket main lekar aayaa he taaki aap puraane khilaadiyon ko bhul jaao
 We noticed that more people were eyeing Umesh Yadav and less on Zaheer Khan

 ’ramij ne kaha ki upmahadweep kii tiimon ko swadesh ke alaava videshon main bhi acha pradarshan karne ke liye apni ‘e’ or under-19 tiimon ko nirantar videshon ke daure karwaane chahie
 The artistic batsman of his time said, "the real challenge of Test cricket is to leave your comfortable place and play in difficult conditions
 har ek team kaa ek chakra hota he
 i think every team has a five-year cycle
 iske baad kai kaarnon se uskaa pradarshan prabhavit hota he
 "he said," The team whose home structure is strong, their decline quickly comes under control
 up mahadweep kii tiimon par isliye zyada dhyaan jaataa he kyonki ve swadesh main tiimon ko buree tarah haraati he jabaki videshon main dabaav main aa jaati hai
