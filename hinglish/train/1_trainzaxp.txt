 The development of tourism and industries in Uttarakhand is being claimed every day
 rajya banane ke baad se yahaan 30,000 karod ru
 Many industrial units have been set up by investing more than capital, but aviation services which are of great importance in terms of tourism and industrial development are dying every day
 rajdhani dehradun ko chhodkar pradesh ke kisi bhi sthaan se koi hawaii seva kahin ke liye bhi uplabdh nahin he
 Uttarakhand State Industrial Development Corporation Limited (SIDCUL) was established for industrial development here, after which industrial areas were established at Rudrapur, Kashipur, Pantnagar in Udham Singh Nagar as well as Bahadrabad in Haridwar and Selakui in Dehradun
 pantnagar, rudrapur or kashipur kii audyogic ikaayiyon main to desh ke namchin udyogpatiyon tata or bajaj ne bhi nivesh kiya
 There are more than 1,000 industrial units of external investors in the region, but despite this the air service is absolutely shabby
 rajya main hawaii sevaaon ke vistaar ke liye chaar hawaii pattiyaan jyoligrant (dehradun), pantnagar (udhamsingh nagar), nainisaini hawaii pattee (pithauragarh) or gauchar (rudraprayag) banaai gayi, lekin dehradun ke jyoligrant airport ko chhod baaki teenon hawaii addon ke ranve par bachche cycle chalaa rahe hai or maveshi ghaas char rahe hai
 Regular flights from Pantnagar Airport have been tried twice, but never been successful
 sthiti yah he ki pantnagar, rudrapur or kashipur kshetron main puunji nivesh karne vaale udyogpati khud ko thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe hai
 They either have to come here by hiring private aircraft or spend more time by road
 sidkul kii sthapana or tarai main udyogikaran ke baad tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ke mukhiya narayandutt tiwari kii pahal par jagson airlines ne 2005 main pantnagar airport se apni sevaayen shuru kii thim
 The company's 18-seater (dornier 228) continued flying from here until 2008

 Meanwhile, the government pulled out of the subsidy on the pretext of expanding the airport in 2008, when the then Civil Aviation Secretary P

 Darbara Singh, president of the Kumaon Garhwal Chamber of Commerce, says that in today's age it is useless to think of development without connectivity
 bakaul darbara tarai se vimaan seva shuru karne ke liye customer hai, paisanger hai
 Even after that this is the misfortune of this region
 ve kehete hai ki pichhali rajya sarkaar dijisie or airport athurity ko is maamle main sahamat nahin kar pai
 Now the new government will have to take an initiative in this regard, otherwise it will soon have a very bad effect on the capital investment in the state

 District Magistrate of Pithoragarh, Dr

 According to Rajesh Kumar, work on the expansion of the runway will be started soon
 pithauragarh main bhi hawaii sevaaon ke vistaar ko lekar raajnneeti kam nahin hui
 In November 2011, just before this time assembly elections, the then cabinet minister and local MLA Prakash Pant landed a 22 seater aircraft on the runway and claimed that air services in Pithoragarh would start from next month
 chunaav se thik pehle hawaii pattee par utaara gaya yah vimaan ek nijee company kaa tha
 Actually this was done to create a vote bank
 haalanki yah 22 seater vimaan mantri ji kii naiya paar nahin kara paaya or ve apana chunaav haar gaye
 The same situation is also in Gauchar's runway
 sarkaar yahaan se sevaayen shuru karne ko lekar kabhi gambhir nahin rahi, jabaki yahaan se pawan hans or prabhatam jaisi nijee companiyaan yatriyon ko chardhaam kii yatra karakar logon ke liye upyogi seva de rahi hai
 Uttarakhand has become the third elected government in 11 years of state formation
 is dauraan bhaajapa or congress rajya main baari-baari se satta kaa sukh bhoga chuki hai, lekin hawaii sevaaon ke vistaar ke liye kisi bhi sarkaar dwaara koi pahal nahin kii gai
 How serious the present government will be about aviation services was also realized when the Ministry of Civil Aviation Department will get an extension on April 1, who did not even mention it
 kyonki pradesh sarkaar abhi bhi naagarik uddyan ko vibhaag hi nahin maanati

 The incident in Sanaa, occupied by the Houthi rebels, was confirmed by two US officials on Wednesday
 haal ke maheenon main aisi duusari ghatana he
 Earlier, the military spokesman of the Houthi rebels had said that our army has killed the US drones late in the evening on Tuesday
 yah pehali baar nahin he ki yaman main america ke drone ko maar giraaya gaya ho
 Earlier in June also, the Houthi rebels killed US drones with the help of Iran
 america bich-bich main yaman main maujuud al kaayda kii shakha al kaayda in arabian peninsula (AQAP) ke thikaanon par hamalaa karata rahata he
 The Yemen branch of al-qaeda increased its strength, taking advantage of a four-year-old fight between the Houthi rebels and President abd-rabu Mansour Hadi
 ek adhikari ne bataaya ki america kaa drone hathiyaaron se las tha
 It was created by General Atomics, a company based in California
 hauthi vidrohiyon ne jameen se hawa main maar karne vaali missile se us drone ko maar giraaya
 However, on the other hand a Yemeni official said that the US was confident that Iran had provided missiles to the Houthi rebels
 abhi yah aspasht he ki drone ko america sena sanchalit kar rahi thi yaa khufia samudaay kar rahaa tha
 The US said that the Trump administration directly blamed Iran for the incident
 june main iran ne hormuj ke jalmaarg par america drone ko maar giraaya tha
 Even then the tension between the two countries had increased
 iran ne daawa kiya ki yah drone unki vayusima ko paar karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, the US rejected Tehran's claim and called Iran's move provocative
 donald trump ne iske baad hamale ke aadesh die the, lekin kuch samay baad hi yah aadesh waapas le liya
 The US broke the nuclear treaty with global forces last year
 iran par ekatarfa aarthik pratibandh laga die the
 Negotiations between the two sides are expected, but Iran said it would negotiate only if the sanctions were lifted
 trump bhi baatcheet ke liye kai baar sanket de chuke hai
 On the attack on US drones, US Military Central Command said that we are completely clear that Iran has carried out this attack
 iran aatankiyon or vidrohiyon kii madad kar rahaa he
 Because of this, balance and peace is not being established in that entire area
 vahiin, america ke neshnal security council ke pravaktaa garret markis ne kaha ki yah hamalaa iran samarthit hauthi vidrohiyon ne kiya he
 Iran is doing such an act to disturb the balance of the region
 jabaki, iran ne kaha ki america ke aarope galat he
 The Gulf country is providing military and financial support to the Arab Houthi rebels
 jabaki, aarope iran par lagaaya ja rahaa he

 pakistan main kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav kii giraftaar ke peeche ek nahin kai pench hai
 Through this, Pakistan is not only trying to confirm the charge of spying on Pakistan, spreading violence in Balochistan, but is also trying to put pressure on Iran somewhere
 maamla aarthik bhi he or sidhaa judaa he pakistan, bharat, iraan, saudi arab or china kii ranneetik zaruuraton se
 Pakistan's Gwadar Port has been built with the help of China and is being extended as a china-pakistan Economic Corridor at a cost of Rs 30,000 crore, but Chabahar Port is also being built with the help of India
 iraan ke sabase garib praant sistan-baluchistan praant ko ab iraan sarkaar viksit karne kii koshish kar rahi he, isliye vahaan par ab chabahaar free trade-industrial zone bhi banaaya gaya he
 Chabahar lies beyond the heavily crowded Strait of Hormuz and is connected to the Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Oman
 yani, agar china ke paas guadar he to bharat ke paas chabahaar
 Once this work is completed, India will connect directly to Afghanistan by sea route, without coming to the middle of Pakistan
 isse gas or urja kii supplai main behad aasaani ho jaaegi
 It is clear that for India, it is very important both economically and strategically
 iraan ke liye bhi yah koi kam ahm nahin
 For him, the development of sistan-balochistan is a way of overcoming the insurgency going on there
 asal main iraan kaa yah ilaaka pakistan ke baluchistan ilaake se laga hua he
 Already separatists are active in Balochistan, Pakistan
 saath hi inkaa samarthan iraan ke baluchistan main ugravadiyon ko bhi miltaa he
 Iran and Pakistan have entered into an agreement to support each other to deal with them in 2014, but Iran has many times accused Pakistan of helping these militants
 aise halaat main kathith bhartiya jasoos kii giraftaar, giraftaar ke elaan kaa vakt, pakistan or iraan kii taraf se aae bayaan, ek alag tasviir kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 Let's take a look at these situations and statements
 mana yah ja rahaa he ki kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav pakistani agenciyon ke kabze main, uski giraftaar ke elaan ke kuch maheene pehle se tha
 In such a situation, the Pakistani army announced its arrest just when Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team (joint Investigation Team) arrived in India to investigate the Pathankot attack, but also Iran's President Hassan Ruhani was in Islamabad
 jab pakistani media ne is maamle main iraan kaa bhi naam lenaa shuru kiya to vahaan ke grih mantri nisaar khan ne aisa na karne kii taakid karte hue kaha ki iraan kaa bhartiya khufia tantra se koi lenaa dena nahin
 Moreover, the Iranian embassy in Islamabad issued a statement warning that if such things continue in the media, friendly relations between Pakistan and Iran can be affected
 tippaniyan According to Pakistani media, Army Chief Raheel Sharif also talked about the involvement of Indian intelligence agency RAW in Pakistan's internal affairs, especially in Balochistan, during a meeting with President Rouhani
 yahaan tak ki sena ke pravaktaa ne ro ke iraan kii zamin kaa istemaal karne ke bare main bhi chintaa jataai thi
 But at a press conference, Iran's President Ruhani flatly denied any such talks with General Raheel Sharif
 pakistan kii is puri kavayad ko iraan par ek dabaav banane kii koshish mana ja saktaa he
 Firing has taken place on the outskirts of both countries
 or pakistan sena ke aise bayaan isi taraf ishaara karte hai ki agar chabahaar main bharat-iraan kaa aisa hi sahyog chalata rahaa to pakistan apni seemaa se iraan main ghusane vaale ugravadiyon par dhilaai barat saktaa he or iraan ke ke liye mushkilen badha saktaa he
 As far as the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav is concerned, India believes that it is a citizen but refuses to be a spy
 bharat kaa kahana he ki iraan ke chabahaar ilaake se yah shaks kaarobaar karata he or uske vahaan se agava karke pakistan pahunchaae jane kaa shaq jataayaa he
 Amidst all this, there are reports that what Jadhav was doing in Chabahar, his business was not being misused and if he was aware of it, he would investigate all these things
 
 saaf he, iraan na to bharat se or na hi pakistan se sambandh bigaadna chahta he, lekin pakistan ke dabaav main bhi nahin aana chahta
 But of course he would also like to investigate Pakistan's charge that Chabahar is not using RAW
 philhal bharat kulbhushan jadhav tak counslar acces, yani islamabad main bhartiya hai kamishan main maujuud rajanyikon ke usase milane kii ijazat, kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 Pakistan's Gwadar Port has been built with the help of China and is being extended as a china-pakistan Economic Corridor at a cost of Rs 30,000 crore, but Chabahar Port is also being built with the help of India
 iraan ke sabase garib praant sistan-baluchistan praant ko ab iraan sarkaar viksit karne kii koshish kar rahi he, isliye vahaan par ab chabahaar free trade-industrial zone bhi banaaya gaya he
 Chabahar lies beyond the heavily crowded Strait of Hormuz and is connected to the Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Oman
 yani, agar china ke paas guadar he to bharat ke paas chabahaar
 Once this work is completed, India will connect directly to Afghanistan by sea route, without coming to the middle of Pakistan
 isse gas or urja kii supplai main behad aasaani ho jaaegi
 It is clear that for India, it is very important both economically and strategically
 iraan ke liye bhi yah koi kam ahm nahin
 For him, the development of sistan-balochistan is a way of overcoming the insurgency going on there
 asal main iraan kaa yah ilaaka pakistan ke baluchistan ilaake se laga hua he
 Already separatists are active in Balochistan, Pakistan
 saath hi inkaa samarthan iraan ke baluchistan main ugravadiyon ko bhi miltaa he
 Iran and Pakistan have entered into an agreement to support each other to deal with them in 2014, but Iran has many times accused Pakistan of helping these militants
 aise halaat main kathith bhartiya jasoos kii giraftaar, giraftaar ke elaan kaa vakt, pakistan or iraan kii taraf se aae bayaan, ek alag tasviir kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 Let's take a look at these situations and statements
 mana yah ja rahaa he ki kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav pakistani agenciyon ke kabze main, uski giraftaar ke elaan ke kuch maheene pehle se tha
 In such a situation, the Pakistani army announced its arrest just when Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team (joint Investigation Team) arrived in India to investigate the Pathankot attack, but also Iran's President Hassan Ruhani was in Islamabad
 jab pakistani media ne is maamle main iraan kaa bhi naam lenaa shuru kiya to vahaan ke grih mantri nisaar khan ne aisa na karne kii taakid karte hue kaha ki iraan kaa bhartiya khufia tantra se koi lenaa dena nahin
 Moreover, the Iranian embassy in Islamabad issued a statement warning that if such things continue in the media, friendly relations between Pakistan and Iran can be affected
 tippaniyan According to Pakistani media, Army Chief Raheel Sharif also talked about the involvement of Indian intelligence agency RAW in Pakistan's internal affairs, especially in Balochistan, during a meeting with President Rouhani
 yahaan tak ki sena ke pravaktaa ne ro ke iraan kii zamin kaa istemaal karne ke bare main bhi chintaa jataai thi
 But at a press conference, Iran's President Ruhani flatly denied any such talks with General Raheel Sharif
 pakistan kii is puri kavayad ko iraan par ek dabaav banane kii koshish mana ja saktaa he
 Firing has taken place on the outskirts of both countries
 or pakistan sena ke aise bayaan isi taraf ishaara karte hai ki agar chabahaar main bharat-iraan kaa aisa hi sahyog chalata rahaa to pakistan apni seemaa se iraan main ghusane vaale ugravadiyon par dhilaai barat saktaa he or iraan ke ke liye mushkilen badha saktaa he
 As far as the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav is concerned, India believes that it is a citizen but refuses to be a spy
 bharat kaa kahana he ki iraan ke chabahaar ilaake se yah shaks kaarobaar karata he or uske vahaan se agava karke pakistan pahunchaae jane kaa shaq jataayaa he
 Amidst all this, there are reports that what Jadhav was doing in Chabahar, his business was not being misused and if he was aware of it, he would investigate all these things
 
 saaf he, iraan na to bharat se or na hi pakistan se sambandh bigaadna chahta he, lekin pakistan ke dabaav main bhi nahin aana chahta
 But of course he would also like to investigate Pakistan's charge that Chabahar is not using RAW
 philhal bharat kulbhushan jadhav tak counslar acces, yani islamabad main bhartiya hai kamishan main maujuud rajanyikon ke usase milane kii ijazat, kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 It is no less important for Iran too
 uske liye sistan-baluchistan kaa vikaas karnaa vahaan chal rahe ugravad par kaabo paane kaa ek tarika he
 Actually, this area of iran is located in Balochistan area of pakistan
 pakistan ke baluchistan main pehle hi algaavvaadi sakriy hai
 At the same time, they are also supported by militants in Balochistan, Iran
 iraan or pakistan ne 2014 main inase nibatane ke liye ek duusare kaa saath dene kaa samjhauta kiya he, lekin iraan kai baar pakistan par in ugravadiyon kii madad kaa aarope laga chukaa he
 In such a situation, the arrest of the alleged Indian spy, the time of declaration of arrest, the statements from Pakistan and Iran, point to a different picture
 ek najar daalate hai in halaat or bayanon par
 It is believed that the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was in the possession of Pakistani agencies, months before his arrest was announced
 aise main pakistani sena ne isaki giraftaar kaa elaan thik us vakt kiya jab na sirf pakistan kii Joint Investigation Team (sanyukt jaanch dal) bharat main pathankot hamale kii jaanch ke liye pahunchi thi, balki iraan ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani bhi islamabad main the
 When Pakistani media started taking Iran's name in this case, then Home Minister Nisar Khan said that Iran had nothing to do with Indian intelligence
 or to or islamabad sthit iraan duutavas ne ek bayaan jari kar chetavanee bhi di ki agar media main is tarah kii baaten jari raheen to pakistan or iraan ke dostana sambandhon par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 The comments pakistani media ke mutabik sena pramukh raahil sharif ne raashtrapati ruhani se mulaakaat ke dauraan bhartiya khufia agency ro ke pakistan ke andruni maamalon main, khaskar baluchistan main dakhal dene ke bare main bhi baat kii thi
 Even the army spokesman had expressed concern about Raw's use of Iran's land
 lekin ek press conference main iraan ke raashtrapati ruhani ne general raahil sharif se aisi kisi baatcheet se saaf inkaar kar diya
 This entire exercise of Pakistan can be considered as an attempt to put pressure on Iran
 donon deshon kii sarhad par kai baar firing ho chuki he
 And such statements of the Pakistan Army point to this that if india-iran cooperation continues in Chabahar, then Pakistan can lax on the militants entering Iran from its border and increase the difficulties for Iran
 jahaan tak kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav kaa sawaal he, to bharat yah maanata he ki yah naagarik to he lekin uske jasoos hone se saaf inkaar karata he
 India says that this man does business from Chabahar area of iran and has raised suspicions of abducting him to Pakistan
 is sabake bich khabaren yah bhi aa rahi hai ki iraan ab jadhav chabahaar main kya kar rahaa tha, uske kaarobaar kaa galat istemaal to nahin ho rahaa tha or agar galat istemaal ho rahaa tha to kya use isaki jaankaree thi, in sab chizon kii jaanch karegaa
 Clearly, Iran neither wants to spoil relations with India nor Pakistan, but does not want to come under pressure from Pakistan either
 lekin nishchit taur par vah pakistan ke is aarope kii bhi jaanch karnaa chahega ki chabahaar kaa istemaal ro to nahin kar rahi
 At present, India is waiting for the consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, ie the permission of the diplomats present in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to meet him
 mana yah ja rahaa he ki kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav pakistani agenciyon ke kabze main, uski giraftaar ke elaan ke kuch maheene pehle se tha
 In such a situation, the Pakistani army announced its arrest just when Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team (joint Investigation Team) arrived in India to investigate the Pathankot attack, but also Iran's President Hassan Ruhani was in Islamabad

 or pakistan sena ke aise bayaan isi taraf ishaara karte hai ki agar chabahaar main bharat-iraan kaa aisa hi sahyog chalata rahaa to pakistan apni seemaa se iraan main ghusane vaale ugravadiyon par dhilaai barat saktaa he or iraan ke ke liye mushkilen badha saktaa he

 It is believed that keeping the fast of Karva Chauth gives a boon of unbroken good luck
 yah sunakar usne apane bhabhiyon se kaha, "aao tum bhi chandramaa ko arghya de lo
 "but she knew this scandal, she said-" Bai Ji! The moon has not come out yet, your brothers are cheating on you and showing the light of fire with a sieve
 " bhabhiyon kii baat sunakar bhi usne kuch dhyaan na diya or bhaaiyon dwaara dikhaae gaye prakaash ko hi arghya dekar bhojan kar liya
 Thus, Ganesha became displeased with the fast after breaking the fast
 iske baad uskaa pati sakht biimaar ho gaya or jo kuch ghar main tha uski beemaari main lag gaya
 When he found out the defects he had done, he repented, praying Ganesh ji and started fasting on Chaturthi again with the law
 shraddhanusaar sabakaa aadar karte hue sabase aashirwad grahan karne main hi man ko laga diya
 In this way, Lord Ganesha became happy on seeing her deeds with devotion and devotion and donated life to her husband and made him rich with wealth after healing
 is prakaar jo koi chal-kapat ko tyaag kar shraddha-bhakthi se chaturthi kaa vrath karenge unhen sabhi prakaar kaa sukh milegaa

 If this situation were not there, the problem of Naxalism would not have arisen

 If a solution was taken by monitoring the problem correctly
 unhone kaha, ‘main aaj vardi main nahin hum to khulkar vichaar vyakt kar saktaa hum
 However, i have no idea of going into politics
 ’unhone anna hajaare or baba ramdev ke andolanon ko lakshya ke nazariye se ek hi bataaya or kaha, ‘main desh bhakton ke saath hum
 We had asked Anna Hazare to prepare a political alternative
 desh main jagriti laaen tabhi vikalp khadaa ho sakegaa

 The former army chief said, "when the opportunity arose, i waged a war against corruption in the army
" meri soch thi ki upar se muhim chalegi tabhi neeche tak sandesh jayega

 loksabhaa main paarit teen talaak bill ko rajyasabha main paarit karana aasaan nahin he
 The NDA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and apart from this, its ally JDU is not with it on this bill
 loksabhaa main bhi is bill par matdaan ke dauraan jediu ke saansadon ne walk out kiya tha
 At present, the BJP has issued a whip for its mps
 loksabhaa main guuruuvaar 25 july ko vipaksh ke baari virodh ke bich teen talaak bill (triple Talaq Bill) paas ho gaya tha
 During voting, 303 votes were cast in favor of the bill, while 82 votes were cast in the protest
 bill par voting se pehle loksabhaa se jediu, tiares, YSR congress or TMC ne walkout kar diya tha
 JDU was separated from the TMC vote, while BJD voted in favor of the bill
 tiares, wiesar congress bill ke khilaaf hai
 Describing gender justice as the core of the Narendra Modi government during the discussion on the bill before the bill was passed, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the bill to ban triple talaq is not a question of politics, religion, community but it is 'respect for women' And there is the question of 'women's justice' and everyone should support this initiative to protect the rights of daughters of Hindustan
 AIMIM ke netaa or saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha tha ki bill main aap kah rahe hai ki agar kisi pati ne patni ko teen baar talaak kah diya to shaadi nahin tuutati, supreme court kaa faisla bhi yahi kahata he phir aap ye kyon kar rahe hai
 He said that this bill is against women
 jab teen saal kii sajaa ho jaae, pati jail main rahe to aurat teen saal tak intjaar kare
 And when he came back after three years, what should he say that my lover has come out to show me the flowers
 ovaisi ne kaha ki aap ek praavdhaan lie ki agar koi tripal talaak detaa he to meher kii rakam kaa 5 guna use bharna pade
 The Congress demanded that the Bill prohibiting triple talaq be referred to the standing committee, saying that it is not proper to make triple talaq a criminal case
 loksabhaa main 'muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak 2019' par charchaa main bhaag lete hue congress saansad gaurav gogoi ne kaha ki bhaajapa kii taraf se yah bhranti failaai ja rahi he ki hamaari party kaa rukh spasht nahin he
 We want to make it clear that our stand is clear
 teen talaak ke khilaaf ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa sabase pehle congress ne swaagat kiya tha
 He said that the Congress was opposed to just three divorces making it a criminal case, whereas it is a civil matter
 gogoi ne is vidheyak ko sthaayee samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang kii
 He said that their husbands have left millions of Hindu women, why are they not being worried? Wow! Can’t believe it’s been 24 YEARS of # Baazigar and my career
 
 Good thing is
 
 i still feel 24

 ast-vyast lifestil or daud-bhaag kii vajah se ham aksar subah kaa brakefast miss kar dete hai
 Initially it is only one or two days but later it becomes a daily habit
 ham sochate hai ki ek vakt nahin khaaya to koi baat nahin dopaher main ham puraa khaanaa kha lenge par shaayad hi aapako pataa ho ki brakefast skip karne se swasthya par kitna bura asar padataa he
 1
 acidity kii samasya:bina kuch khaae ghar se nikalne par acidity kii samasya ho sakati he kyonki puri raat aapke pet main kuch bhi nahin gaya hota he or subah bhi aap bina aap kuch khaae hi ghar se baahar nikal aae hai
 If you eat anything while leaving home, there will be no problem of acidity
 2
 Effect on metabolism: When you wake up in the morning, your blood pressure decreases
 saath hi sugar level bhi
 Morning breakfast serves to rebalance it
 poshak tatwon se purna ek sampurna naashtaa aapako swasth rakhane ke saath hi aapaki upaapachay kii kriya ko bhi niyat karata he
 3
 urja ke liye:ham sabhi ke sharir main subah ke vakt kuch kam urja hoti he or subah ke hamaare aalasy kii bhi yahi pramukh vajah hoti he
 But if you skip breakfast in the morning, then your energy level keeps falling further
 jisase aapako kamajori mahasoos ho sakati he
 4
 dhyaan kendrit karne main pareshaani:subah kanaashtaa skip kar dene se urja kii purti nahin ho paati he
 Due to which, even after reaching office, you are not able to start your work with full attention
 5
 Serious health effects: It has been observed that people who regularly eat breakfast are healthier than those who do not have breakfast
 aisa sirf isliye hota he kyonki unke sharir ko samay se urja praapt ho jaati he jisaki vajah se anya shaareerik kriyaayein sucharu rup se chalati rahati hai
 6
 vajan badhanaa:agar aap subah paushtik naashtaa lete hai to isse aapkaa vajan bhi control main rahata he
 It has been found that people who do not have breakfast tend to be obese faster than those who do not have breakfast
 7
 For brain activity: The brain also needs energy to work
 agar aap apana naashtaa sahi se nahin karte hai to dimag ko energy nahin mil paati he or uski sakriyata par asar padataa he
 8
 madhumeh:jo log subah kaa naashtaa nahin kar pate he unamem madhumeh hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Especially in women, the risk of this is highest

 khaas baat yah he ki is maheene main aap kuch saadhaaran se upaay karke aap apni kundali main vyaapt paapi grahon ke ashubh prabhaav ko shubh fal main badal sakate hai
 Let's know which planets are inauspicious and what effect they have on our life
 vaidic jyotish main nau grahon or sutaees nakshatron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 All these planets have some auspicious planets, some cruel and some sinful planets
 paap grahon main shani, rahu or ketu maane jate hai
 They have the ability to motivate life towards sin karma or sin feeling
 in grahon kaa prabhaav itnaa tej hota he ki inke bure prabhaav main aakar bina ichha ke bhi vyakti paap karmon kii or chalaa jaataa he
 What is the sin effect of Shani and how to get auspicious results in the spring - due to the side effects of Shani, a person is lazy, careless and harsh
 - vyakti tamsik devataaon kii upasna karata he
 - Leads to the following tasks without cleaning
 - shani jab shubh parinaam detaa he to vyakti anushaasit hota he
 - moves towards God through meditation and religion
 shravan maas main paaen shani kii shubhta-- shani ke shubh prabhaav ko badhaane ke liye shanivaar ke din pipal ke chote-chote do paudhe kisi sthaan par lagaaein or hanuman ji kii puja karen
 What is the sin effect of Rahu, how will it give auspicious results in the spring - inauspicious Rahu character leads to downfall and intoxication
 - rahu vyakti ko shadyantra or dusron ko pareshaan karne kii aadat detaa he
 - Due to Rahu one criticizes religion and spirituality
 - rahu kaa shubh prabhaav ho to vyakti janm se hi siddh hota he
 - In such a situation one discovers a new path of spirituality
 shravan maas main paaen rahu kii shubhta-- rahu kaa shubh prabhaav badhaane ke liye satvik aahaar grahan karen
 - Worship Shiva
 - rogiyon or viklangon kii seva karen
 - Must practice yoga and meditation
 ketu kaa paap prabhaav kya he or sawan main kaise degaa shubh parinaam-- ketu kaa ashubh prabhaav hone se vyakti dharm or ishwar kaa virdohi ho jaataa he
 - Holds God responsible for every problem of life
 - kabhi kabhi ulate sidhe tantric prayog karke maansik rup se asantulit ho jaataa he
 Ketu makes pilgrimages if it is carried towards virtue
 - vyakti ko sadguru detaa he, sant banaata he
 How to make Ketu auspicious - bathe regularly
 - tirth sthanon or shubh jagahon kii yatra karen
 - Worship Ganesh ji

 varkha chulanivah kamottejnaa praapt karne main asamarth tha
 She did not find the partner attractive
 lekin vah usase pyaar karata tha or rishta khatm nahin karnaa chahta tha
 So he figured out the way - first provoking himself and then coming to bed
 is tarah, use apni kamiyon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa tha
 She always wanted different things
 usne paaya ki vah ek yon anand viheen jivan main dhansati ja rahi thi
 She would turn on the DVD and try what she saw there as much as possible
 aakhirkaar, kuch nayaa khojane se to nakal kar lenaa hi aasaan tha
 They all did not know how to make their sex life thrill
 iske liye kya karen, kaise aage badhen, in baton par zyada dimag na lagaate hue, unhone khud ko 'shikshit' karne ke liye porn kaa istemaal kiya or samajha ki apane yon anand ko badhaane main yah kis prakaar madadgaar ho saktaa he
 All these people were using porn for their own benefit
 yah sach he, porn acchhee bhoomika nibhaataa he jab koi iskaa prayog apane pradarshan kii chintaa ghataane ke liye karata he, jaisaa ki pehle udhaaharan vaale vyakti ke maamle main rahaa
 Or when one uses the methods seen in these films for self pleasure, as the woman did
 yaa jab yugal iskaa upyog yon jivan se judi jaankariyaan lene ke liye karte hai
 But when does it become harmful, when does it get in the way of healthy relationships? The dictionary defines continuous use as 'addiction' (addiction) to the level of something harmful
 sangyanatmak vyavahaarparak chikitsake kshetra main visheshgyata vaale naidanik manovaigyanikon or manochikitsakon ke rup main ham ediction yaa lat ko us aadat ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jab yah jivan kaa aisa 'anany' hissaa ban jaataa he jiske bina koi vyakti kaary hi nahin kar sake
 Porn 'addict' is a person who can perform sexual acts with a partner or alone only when porn goes along
 us vyakti ke liye porn dekhnaa ek tarah kii, 'kamottejak vastu' (fettish) yani aisi 'jarurat' ban jaataa he jiske bina vah yon sambandh bana hi nahin saktaa
 Of course, victims of 'addiction' are dependent on many factors, including their own personality
 haalanki, koi yah nahin kah saktaa he ki porn yaa kisi anya cheez kii praathamikta ko lat kaha ja saktaa he
 The functional term for addiction is procrastination or inability to function without the presence of that object
 usne kisi mahila ko saathi maananaa kathin samajha
 All these thoughts of what a woman should look like and how 'erotic' she should be in her mind stemmed from porn videos she watched for years when she was young, or from women's magazines that described how women should be considered 'sexy'
 needed
 is prakaar koi bhi mahila uske liye waisi 'acchhee' nahin thi or vah ek se duusare kii ore bhaagta rahaa
 She was always dissatisfied with her partners
 uske liye, uske partneron ke paryaapt 'lambey' nahin the
 She was also caught up in the same fictional fantasy that struck her mind due to prolonged viewing of porn and she was entangled in some exaggerated thoughts about the masculinity of any man
 kalpana or manyataon kaa doharaav yahi sthiti paidaa kar saktaa he
 Especially those reluctant people who do not question the things they see or hear
 bhale hi 'haath kangan ko aarasi kya' kii kahawat vaali baat yahaan kuch had tak sahi he lekin ek anchaaha porn dekhne vaala, badha-chadhaakar pesh kii gai chizon par sawaal hi nahin uthaata he
 They start cursing themselves believing that they are not getting what they are looking for! And these comparisons spoil the balance of their sex life
 aksar, nakal karne kii apni jaruraton main ve apana nuksaan kar lete hai or / yaa apane partner ke saath un 'standders' ko puraa na kar paane ke kaaran itane acroshit ho jate hai ki aksar unke jivan kaa astitv khatre main pad jaataa he
 Because they have limited their sexual union to the slot of either all or nothing! How brilliant a woman or man must be, a nonsensical idea that good sex is one that lasts for an unlimited amount of time and many orgasms
 (orgasm) is the 'way', sexual intercourse is sexual and to increase pleasure it is necessary to try different positions in sex and there are many misconceptions that dominate people's minds
 
 or is sthiti main porn dekhnaa hanikaarak hona shuru ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is not just porn that directly affects our perceptions, but rather the thing that we make those assumptions
 lekh ke pehle bhaag main logon ne apane phaayde ke liye porn kaa istemaal kiya or iske jariye apni madad kii
 In another, people had made some unrealistic assumptions and had to bear the brunt of it
 ham kamasutra kii dharti par hai, lekin shuddhtavaadi vichaar abhi bhi bahut haaavee hai
 Instead of passing any moral order, let us understand pornography from the perspective that it can prove to be a double-edged sword
 porn kii lat main uljhe log jaisaa dekha vaisaa karne ke pher main manobal ganvaa dete hanvarkha chulani leelavati aspataal, mumbai kii clinical psychologist / psycotherapist or neuyork sthit albert elice institute kii associat phelo or suparvizer hai
 *** desh kii rajdhani dilli main 13,000 se adhik bhagode apradhi hai jinke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj he
 According to Delhi Police figures, 13,621 criminals are still missing
 haalanki 15 march tak 711 ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The police has achieved special success this year
 36 varsh se faraar ek apradhi ko police ne giraftaar kiya he
 It killed one of his co-workers
 iske alaava hatya ke maamle main ek mrit vyakti ko 20 saal ke baad giraftaar kiya gaya he
 a man who escaped from Dubai sentenced to one year jail has been arrested after 10 years
 ek pakhwada pehle, dilli police ne faraar aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 174 (e) ke tahat karrwai karne ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya tha
 Europe's declining economy has suffered another setback
 antarrashtriya credit reating agency standard and pors ne eurozon kii 17 main se nau deshon kii reating ko gata diya he, jisamen france, austria, italy or spain shaamil hai
 But even in such a bad time, Germany has retained its Triple a rating
 agency ne is girwat ke liye in deshon kii sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The euro is at the bottom of the last 16 months against the dollar
 frans ke vittamantri ne kaha he ki standard and pors ne unke desh kii reating tripal e se neeche kar di he, lekin franswa baarwang ne kaha he ki credit reating agenciyon ko desh kii nitiyon ko prabhavit nahin karne denge
 This is a major setback for France and the move will increase the cost of government debt in France
 dollar ke mukaable euro pichley 16 maheene ke neeche str par he
 The French Finance Minister has said that Standard & Poor's has lowered his country's rating to triple A, but François Barwang has said that credit ratings will not allow agencies to influence the country's policies
 yah frans ke liye ek bada jhatka he or is kadam se france main sarkari karje kii keemat bad jaaegi

 In his address, Neeraj Shekhar fiercely targeted the central government over the announcements made in the budget
 neeran ne kaha ki sarkaar ne yojanaon ne kai banaai hai lekin unke kriyanvayan ke liye thos niti nahin banaai
 Because of this, all the schemes of the government are failing on the ground
 pakora vivaad par bhi boleniraj ne apane sambodhan main sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki chaiwale kaa betaa pradhanmantri ban gaya he lekin ab pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki pakoravaale kaa betaa pakora hi bechney ko majaboor ho

 a year of political journey of Yogi Sarkar is being completed
 aise main unke kaam-kaaj se lekar unke dwaara uthaae gaye kadam kaa moolyankan kiya ja rahaa he
 Since becoming CM, Yogi has taken one step after another, which is completely opposite to his traditional image
 yogi adityanath kareeb ek saal pehle jis tarah se muslim samaaj ke khilaaf jehar ugalate the, ab waisi bhashaa istemaal nahin kar rahe hai
 They are busy in the exercise of makeover their image
 yogi apni paramparaagat kattarwadi hindutv kii chhavi se baahar nikalne or samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke bich gahari paith banane kii koshish main hai
 Yogi has taken 5 steps in his one-year term, which shows that he wants to identify himself as an evolutionary leader
 yogi ab masjid bhi jane ko taiyaaryogi adityanath upi main kattar hindutv ke sabase bade chehre ke taur par pahachaane jate hai
 His controversial statements about Muslims before becoming CM are well known
 ab soobe ke mukhiya hai to yogi masjid bhi jane ke liye taiyaar hai
 At an event, Yogi Adityanath said, 'if i get an invitation from the mosque, i will go there too
 mujhe bataur mukhyamantri kahin jane main koi dikkat nahin
 By the way, i am a Hindu and according to my faith i have freedom of worship
 main pradesh ke har dharm-mat ke naagarik kaa mukhyamantri hum or sabko apni aasthaa kaa anusaran karne ke liye sarkaar puri suraksha degi
 'madrasa and Sanskrit school yogi Adityanath were once against the madrasas
 siem banane se pehle tak yogi madrason ko lekar tarah tarah aarope lagaate rahete the
 But now their attitude towards madrasas has changed
 yogi kah rahe hai ki madrason ko band karnaa hal nahin he, balki madrason or sanskrit vidhyalay kaa aadhunikeekaran karnaa chahie
 He said that Sanskrit schools should also adopt other subjects, only then there will be benefit
 madrasa or sanskrit vidhyalay kii baat ek saath karnaa yogi kii parpanraagat chhavi ke vipareet he
 The BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh are sweeping in front of the Taj at the time when they were making rhetoric about the Taj Mahal
 bijepi netaa tajmahal ko shivmandir bataane main lage the
 Amidst all this, Yogi Adityanath went to the Taj Mahal's premises and started a broom to start the cleanliness campaign
 jhaadu lagane ke baad siem yogi shahjahan park ke punaruddhar va agra kila- taj mahal ke madhya paidal path ke vikaas yojana kaa shilanyas kiya
 Yogi's plans to sweep the Taj complex and to make the Taj complex beautiful had left many leaders of his own party quite unhappy
 lekin yogi kaa ye kadam unki chhavi ke vipareet tha
 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath did not stand the same way as the bjp-ruled state's CM took a tough stand on the film No Banpadmavat on Padmavat
 supreme court dwaara film par lagi roak hataae jane ke baad yogi ne padmavati film ko lekar koi bayaan nahin diya he or na hi film ko soobe main bain karne kii baat kahi he
 While the Rajput society is angry about this film
 in sabake baavjood yogi kaa film par bain na lagaana kahin na kahin unke chhavi ke vipareet he
 Although Yogis themselves also come from the Rajput society

 This Chakravyuh of bad omen is considered so dangerous that in 19 years only Mayawati visited Noida as CM
 uske baad wo bhi satta main waapas nahin aa sakin
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has broken this myth by coming to Noida
 siem pad sanbhaalane ke baad se yogi teen baar noida kaa daura karke totake ko khatm kar rahe hai
 Adityanath's Hindutva image is his hold in a class of society due to his ability to make a place in the hearts of the middle class
 siem banane ke baad ab apana dayera badhanaa chaahate hai
 He has taken a step towards making his place in the hearts of the middle class of the society
 isi ke maddenjar unhone bilders se home byrs ko awaas dilaane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 Home buyers in the state were troubled by the dictatorial attitude of the builders for a decade
 bilders home byrs ko awaas kaa kabja dene ko taiyaar nahin the
 Governments have come and gone in the province, but the problems of home buyers remained the same

 a large section of the home buyers come from the middle class

 modi virdohi kshatrap 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kii aahat ke saath hi tisare morche ke liye ekajute ho rahe hai
 In UP, the SP and the BSP have forgotten the 23-year-old rivalry
 duusari ore telugana ke siem kesiar ne tisare morch kii charchaa ko phir hawa di, to pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee isaki aguwai karne or ise jameen par utaarne kii jaddojahad main jute gayi
 The Congress is happy that the opposition is coming together against Modi in 2019
 lekin kshatrapon kii ekajutata bijepi se zyada congress ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 In such a situation, tension is not good news for the Congress but a third front exercise
 kyonki congress bhi isi kavayad main juty he
 UPA chairman and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi had called the opposition parties for dinner recently
 rashtriya str par vipakshi golbandi kii koshishon main lagi congress ke liye mamata banerjee or sapa-basapa ne 2019 kii siyaasi raah main mushkilen paidaa kerani shuru kar di hai
 Mamta met Manglawar with leaders of political parties in Delhi in the exercise of the Third Front
 is fehrist main ensipi kshadhyaksh sharad pavaar, shivasena netaa sanjay raut, tidipi ke netaa wies choudhary, tiares kii ke
 Kavita, along with bjd's Pinaki Mishra, rjd's Misa Bharti are the leaders of seven parties
 itnaa hi nahin mamata bijepi ke baagi netaaon ke saath bhi sampark karnaa chaahati he
 In the parties with whom Mamata has met, the leaders of other political parties, except the Shiv Sena, are allies of the Congress in one way or the other
 aise main ye dal agar tisare morch kaa hissaa banate hai to kahin na kahin congress ke liye jhatka hoga
 In fact, the Congress is trying to unite these satraps in the electoral fray in 2019
 teesraa morcha banane par modi ke mukaable cheharaa koun hoga, ye vipaksh ke bich bada sawaal he, jiskaa uttar talash kar paanaa aasaan nahin he
 The Congress does not seem to be in the mood to accept the leader of any regional party as the face of the Prime Minister
 vahiin vipaksh ke kshatrap jo congress ke sambhavit sahyogi dal hai, wo philhal rahul gandhi or congress ke anya kisi netaa ko piem ummidavaar ke taur par sweekaar karne ko raji nahin hai
 Actually the satrap has its own political power
 upi main 80 loksabhaa, pashchim bengal main 42, bihar main 40 or tamilnadu main 39 siten hai
 In all, there are around 201 Lok Sabha seats and Congress is the junior partner (SP, BSP, TMC, Left, RJD and DMK) in these four states
 aise main congress ko kshetreey dalon kii marji par nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 The demand of the Congress is not going to be fulfilled in these states, but will have to depend on the mercy of the regional parties
 iske alaava jis tarah se gaiyrcongressi or garabijepi dalon ke saath tisare morchi kii kavayad kii ja rahi he
 This may lead to a political loss of Congress in 2019
 congress adhyaksh ke taur par jis din rahul gandhi kii tajposhi ho rahi thi, us samay unke sahyogi dalon ke netaa unhen 2019 main piem bataa rahe the, lekin teen maheene ke baad ab rahul ko 2019 kaa piem ummidavaar bataane se gurej kar rahe hai
 This means that in 2019 Rahul may be the face of the Congress but will be the opposition, it is difficult to say
 slater house, boojadkhana, katlakhaana yaa phir qamela kah lijie
 That is, the place where the license to cut animals is given
 magar ye license sirf baffalo yani bhens ke liye he
 And this slatter house remains the biggest issue in UP nowadays
 is mudde se judaa ek sawaal jiskaa jawaab har koi jaananaa chahataa he, wo ye ki kya ab upi ke saare slater house band kar die jaaenge yaa phir surf un boojadkhaanon par taale lagenge jo gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se chal rahe hai? to aaie aaj aapako upi ke boojadkhaanon ko puraa sach bataate hai
 Politics about slaughterhouses is not just about four crore people of UP, who are called as Muslims
 mudda sirf sloter house yaa boojadkhaane ko band karaane kaa nahin he, balki sawaal katlakhaane ko lekar siyasat kaa bhi he
 The biggest question that arises from this politics is that now all the slaughter houses of UP will be closed? Will all animal slaughter locks be done? Or will only those slaughterhouses where there is illegal occupation, that is, those who do not have the license to kill animals? Do not make this question trivial nor forget to understand it only and only politics
 kyonki maamla 17 hajaar karod kaa he or kareeb teen lakh logon ke rojgaar se judaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to put forth the truth beyond politics
 wo sach jise khud bijepi ke kuch netaaon ne apane bhaashan se ulajhaa diya he
 The truth is, what is the real truth of the Slater House in UP and what is the reality of the statements made about the Slaughter House? Only illegal slaughterhouses were to be taken
 Yes, first of all, know that the animals being slaughtered in the Slaughter House What is the truth of So let me tell you that there are a total of 285 slaughter houses in UP, which have the license to cut the animals, and in all these slatter houses buffalo are cut, whose meat is called beef
 chunki upi main gau maance par pratibandh he
 Hence, no slaughterhouse has got the license to kill the cow
 yani kaayade se gaaj un boojadkhaanon par giraayi jaani he jo gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se chal rahe hai
 Which is forbidden in the book of law
 wo pehle bhi thi ab bhi he
 Just before the bureaucrats would ignore it
 or ab farmaan milte hi ection main aa gaye
 That is, there was never any fault in the law
 khot to kaayade se un logon main tha jo zila str par ise lagu karavaate the
 Now the BJP has promised to shut down the abattoirs in the elections
 magar avaidh boojadkhaanon ko chhodkar un boojadkhaanon kaa kya jo centre sarkaar se license liye baithe hai or unka kya jo yantric factriyon main meet kaa kaarobaar karke desh kii kul aamadani ko 26 hazaar karod se bhi zyaada kar chuke hai
 And we are going to do 40 thousand crores in the coming time
 duniya kaa number 1 bif exporter he bharatbadi kashmakash he
 
 jis vaidhanik prakriya kii baat upi ke up mukhyamantri kaishav prasad maury kar rahe hai, na to uskaa or na hi us pink revelution kii baat bijepi ke sankalp patr main he, jiskaa zikr piem modi kiya karte the
 Let us also have a look at the figures which are telling how much income the country earns from this business
 bharat duniya kaa number 1 bif exporter desh he
 The highest beef export in the country is from UP
 2015 main 7,515 lakh kilo meet kaa utpaadan upi se hua
 In 2015, the country's total revenue from beef exports was around 27 thousand crores
 jisamen akele upi ne kul 17 hazaar karod kii kamai kii
 Among the three districts, the demand for buffalo meat is the highest in the worldwide illegal slotter houses, and India is its largest exporter
 aankadon ke mutabik duniyabar main bhens ke meet kaa 20 pratishat sirf bharat se export hota he
 India has 28 percent buffalo in Uttar Pradesh
 yani bharat main sabase zyada bhainse uttar pradesh main he
 60 percent of India's slaughterhouses and meat processing units are in Uttar Pradesh alone
 licency sloter house kii vajah se pradesh ke kareeb 3 lakh logon ko rojgaar mila hua he
 Bijnor, Amroha and Chandpur in western UP have the most illegal slotter houses
 licency kii aad main avaidh boojadkhaanehindustan duniya main baffalo meet kaa sabase bada niryaatak desh koi aaj se nahin balki barason se he
 Even from the rest of the products associated with it, crores of rupees are deposited in the treasury of the country every year
 or to or desh kii kai badi dawa companikaan bhi dawa banane main inke alag-alag products kaa istemaal karti hai
 But there is also another truth that many non-licensee slaughterhouses are also running under the guise of licensee slaughterhouses
 jo sachmuch har tarah se nuksaandeh hai or jinpar lagaam lagaana jaruri he
 The increase in the number of buffaloes in UP means that this linkage of animal products with animal products to the Indian economy is just a glimpse
 
 But the question is that the reality of the picture of slaughterhouses being presented in UP as soon as Yogi becomes Chief Minister is a reality
 Livestock Census 2012 kii report ye bataati he ki saal 2007 ke mukaable 2012 main uttar pradesh main bhainson kii sankhya main 28 fisadi kaa izapha hua he, jabaki isi dauraan uttar pradesh main gaayon kii sankhya bhi 10 fisadi bad gai he
 Maharashtra's largest slaughterhouse, the Animal Husbandry Department, in response to a question asked through RTI, has also said that UP, which is most notorious for slaughterhouses in the country, is actually second in the case of most slaughter houses
 jahaan sirf 285 boojadkhaane hai
 While the first number in this list is from Maharashtra, which has 316 slaughterhouses
 upi main teen darjan boojadkhaanon ke paas he licensoitana hi nahin uttar pradesh main kareeb teen darjan boojadkhaane aise hai, jo centre sarkaar se license praapt or registerd hai
 7 of which are in Aligarh
 5 gajiabad jile main
 Four in Unnao
 teen meerut or do saharanpur main hai
 Apart from this, one abattoir is also registered at Barabanki, Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar, Gautam Budh Nagar, Hapur, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Jhansi, and Lucknow
 engiti ne avaidh sloter house par maanga javabpichley saal central polushan control board ne engiti yani neshnal green tribunel ko ye jaankaree di thi ki upi ke 126 boojadkhaanon kii jaanch ke baad pataa chalaa ki unamem se sirf ek ke paas hi boojadkhaane kaa license tha
 However, after examining all the licensed slaughterhouses, it was also revealed that only 21 of them have the right treatment plant
 engiti ne isi ke baad centre or upi sarkaar ko notice bhej kar aligarh, gajiabad, sanbhal or bulandshahr main chal rahe gaiyr-kanoonee sloter house par jawaab maanga tha
 UP is the largest beef exporter state: UP is the largest beef exporter state in India
 yahaan beef kaa matlab bhens ke meet se he
 The emphasis on Beef Words is because the debate in the country has always been more than any issue
 jabaki sarkari aankadon ke mutabik haqiqat ye he ki desh se export hone vaale animal prodect kaa 95% fisadi hissaa bhens kaa rahaa he
 In such a situation, this discussion is once again happening strongly because the BJP has created a panic among millions associated with this profession by taking a pledge to close illegal and mechanical slaughterhouses
 24 ghante main shuru ho gai karravaiupi main yogi adityanath ke siem pad kii shapath lene ke 24 ghante ke andar hi yogi sarkaar ne bijepi sankalp patr ke vaadon ko puraa karnaa shuru kara diya he
 Sealing of illegal abattoirs has started in many areas of the state
 jinamein varanasi, lakhimpur khiri, unnav, ghazipur, elahabaad, dasna, saharanpur, mathura, shamali, aligarh, bulandshahr, meerut, kanpur, ghaziabad, barabanki, or sanbhal ke boojadkhaane pramukh hai
 For many people, the question of life and death is different from the debate of illegal and legitimate, and whose family life needs to be abused to survive
 unamem bahut bechaini he
 They do not understand that if it starts happening overnight, then what will they eat and where will it go
 yogi sarkaar ke ection se dar kaa alam ye he ki amroha ke gajraula main meet kii avaidh dukaan band karne pahunchi police ko dekhakar ek dukandaar ne khud par mitti kaa tel daal liya
 The government could not refuse the promise The promise to shut down the abattoirs was included in the first list of the BJP during the election campaign
 magar hakeekat to ye he ki sarkaar se lekar aam janata tak boojadkhaanon ko band karne naa karne par kanfus he
 Even the most learned are scratching their heads
 sarkaar ke liye bhi mushkil ye he ki jo vaada kiya usase mukar nahin sakati
 And barring small-scale merchants, they cannot lay their hands on the neck of big businessmen because the business of thousands of crores is connected with this and the employment of millions of people of UP
 isliye ratorat koi nai kranti aa jaaegi
 Such an expectation is also meaningless
 varisht bhaajapa netaa ram madhav (ram Madhav) ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki jammu-kashmir (jammu and Kashmir) main jo netaa najarband hai, unhen sheeghra hi reeha kiya jayega or ve apni ‘saamaanya' rup se raajnneetik gatividhiyon main hissaa le sakate hai

 He said that the area which had been entangled in law and order problem for months, has now become peaceful after keeping more than 200 leaders under house arrest
 rammadhav ne kaha, ‘‘yah dushprachaar he ki (jammu-kashmir main) hajaaron logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Let me tell you today that 200 leaders are in custody as a precautionary measure
 ehtiyaati hiraasat saamaanya kanoon vyavastha kaa hissaa he

 He said that keeping some 200 people in jail is largely a state of peace barring a few incidents
 rammadhav ne kaha, ‘‘aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki kitna prabhavi upaay he yah
 But you did not understand that i am saying that he will be in jail forever

 The biggest Mahamanch of the Hindi world
 filmkaar mahesh bhatta (mahesh Bhatt) kaa kahana he ki jab bhi anupam kher (anupam Kher) kuch hasil karte hai, to alag-alag raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon ke baavjood unka dil garv se bhar jaataa he
 Mahesh Bhatt was the one who launched actor Anupam Kher in the Hindi film industry with his 1984 film 'saaransh'
 kher (64) dakshinpanthi raajnneetik vichaardhaara ko maanate hai or pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Modi) ke bahut bade samarthak hai
 While Mahesh Bhatt is known for a liberal and secular political ideology
 unki vaicharik asamanta kaa vishay anupam kher (anupam Kher) kii kitaab 'lemons life thot me ananonly' kii lonchig ke maukey par saamne aayaa, jahaan mahesh bhatta (mahesh Bhatt) atithi ke taur par pahunche the
 During this time, Bhatt was questioned what is it that holds him together despite the opposite ideologies in politics
 is kaarykram ke dauraan media se baat karte hue mahesh bhatta (mahesh Bhatt) ne kaha, "mujhe khushi he ki yah sawaal saamne aayaa
 Despite our completely different political ideologies, you keep thinking about us whatever you want
 mujhe yaad he 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle karan thapar (patrkaar) ne hamen ek televijan saakshaatkaar main ek-duusare ke khilaaf khadaa karne kii koshish kii thi
 At that time he (anupam Kher) disagreed with me, but this is what Anupam Kher means
 "mahesh bhatta (mahesh Bhatt) ne kaha, "ham ek hi chat ke neeche kyon nahin rah sakate, jahaan ham ek-duusare se asahmat ho sakate hai? or ham us maanviya prem or sneh ko barkaraar kyon nahin rakh sakate, jo maanav jati ke astitv ke liye aavashyak he
 "bhatt, who gave Anupam Kher a chance in Bollywood, said that when Kher achieves something, his heart is filled with pride

 endie main seat bantwaare main sabase zyada nuksaan bijepi ko hua he isliye sabase zyada aantarik ladaai bhi bijepi main hi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 bjp's 4 seats have gone to JDU and one seat to LJP while party's national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain's seat in Bhagalpur has also gone to JDU
 somvaar ko jediu ke mahasachiv aaaraseepi singh dilli gaye
 RCP Singh's visit to Delhi after seat sharing is being linked to this
 bijepi main sabase bady ghamasan kii vajah kendriya mantri giriraaj singh kii seat navada algedy ke hisse main jane se or shahanvaj hossain kii seat jediu ko jane kii vajah se he
 There is a tussle between him and Rajya Sabha MP RK Sinha over the news that Patna Sahib has been decided to seat Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad
 bhagalpur or balmikinagar kii seat jediu ko jane se sthaneey bijepi kaaryakartaaon main naaraazgi dikh rahi he or kai mandal adhyakshon ne samuhik istife kii peshkash bhi kii he
 Giriraj Singh is upset with Nawad not getting seat
 unhone kaha ki nawad seat algepi ko dene se pehle unase poocha tak nahin gaya
 However, it is believed that Giriraj Singh will be given ticket from Begusarai from where he wanted to contest in 2014
 lekin giriraaj singh iske jawaab main kehete hai ki mai kaaryakarta hum, kaaryakarta tha or kaaryakarta rahoonga
 This means that the party will contest elections from where it is said
 lekin giriraaj singh ke is jawaab se begusarai se hi tikat ke daavedaar bijepi ke emelsi rajnish kumaar ko sahan nahin hua or unhone twit kar kaha ki giriraaj singh ko ab apana moh maaya samet kar naatak band kar dena chahie or begusarai aakar ladane kii taiyaari kerani chahie
 Rajnish Kumar says that for the last several days, it has been happening that Nawada seat has gone to LJP, why did Giriraj Singh not speak when he was silent
 ab jabaki siton ke bantwaare kaa elaan ho gaya he to uske baad apni naaraazgi jaahir kar rahe hai
 He is not even saying that he will not contest from Begusarai
 rajnish kumaar kaa kahana he ki begusarai main wo apane logon ko chunaav ke liye taiyaari karne ke liye bhi bol rahe hai
 BJP is preparing to field Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from Patna Sahib, but from here Rajya Sabha MP RK Sinha is also claiming
 donon kysth jati se aate hai or patna sahib kysth bahul loksabhaa kshetra he
 The bjp's top command is Ravi Shankar Prasad's first choice, while the RSS is trying to make RK Sinha a candidate
 somvaar ko kysth mahasabha ne bhi kaha ki aar ke sinha ko hi unka samarthan he
 bjp-ruled Madhya Pradesh has reached the first position in the country, overtaking Bihar, the fastest growing nda-ruled state so far
 kendriya sankhyikeey sanghathan kii 2012-13 kii praarambhik report main madhya pradesh ko aarthik vikaas ke maamle main number van bataaya gaya he
 With this achievement, Gadgad Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan says that his resolve seems to be fulfilled and he attributes this to his dream of making Madhya Pradesh play an effective role in the development of the country, giving credit to his leadership and team spirit
 Huh
 vikaas yojanaon kaa locarpan karne ke liye kendriya sansadeey kaarymantri kamalnath ke garh chhindwara pahunche chouhan se milane ko umadi bheed kii vajah se unhone kai daur main india tude ke pramukh samvaadadaata santosh kumaar se baatcheet kii
 Here are excerpts from a special conversation with him: In the latest report of the Central Statistical Organization, the economic progress of the state has been ranked number one in the country
 rajya kii is uplabdhi par aap kya kahenge?mere liye prasannataa kii baat he ki hamaara sankalp puraa hota dikh rahaa he
 Last year we were in double digit in terms of gross domestic product, whether it is GDP of GDP or agriculture growth rate and this time also in double digit
 ab ham bimaaru rajya kii shrenee se baahar nikal chuke hai
 In the last five-six years, every effort we have made to increase infrastructure, lay a network of roads, 24-hour electricity will now be available in every village by the end of May and along with that we have focused on agriculture, industry and human resource development
 Due to this, the economy of Madhya Pradesh has become vibrant
 kheti phaayde kaa dhandha he isliye kisaanon kii bhi kray shakti badi he, iskaa laabh bhi pradesh ko mila he
 We are proud of this achievement, but there is a possibility of moving forward
 vikaas dar badhane or use barkaraar rakhane ke peeche aap mukhya kaarak (factor) kya maanate hai?suniyojit vikaas kii yojanaayen banaai
 Madhya Pradesh had immense potential, that potential was not exploited
 hamane krishi ko aage badhaane ke liye teen guna zyada main sinchai kii vyavastha kii
 Earlier, irrigation was done on 7 lakh hectares in the state, now it has increased to 24 lakh hectares
 kisaan ko shunya byaaj dar par karj diya, gehun par ham 1500 ru
 We are giving bonus per quintal
 kisaanon ko hamane itani suvidha di he, crop pattern bhi hamane change kiya he or uskaa phayda bhi pradesh ko mila he
 Has started cultivation of fruits, flowers and vegetables
 duusari baat industry jo kabhi yahaan aati nahin thi, lekin hamane lagaataar global invester summit karke udyogpatiyon ko aakarshith kiya he
 Today, in view of setting up industries in Madhya Pradesh, our state has become one of the first rows of the country
 ek nahin anekon industry har sector main aa rahi he
 We also emphasized on human skill development, it has its own contribution, laying of network of roads for the supply of electricity has its own contribution
 garib aadmi kii aamadani bade or vikaas kaa prakaash garib tak kaise pahunche iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa
 He did many things to not only distribute to the poor, but also to increase his income
 jaise haath thele vaale ko haath thele kaa maalik banaaya, rickshaw vaale ko rickshaw kaa, kaarigaron ko karj par margin mani kaa praavdhaan kiya, byaaj par sabsidi kaa kaam
 The main efforts we have made are power, irrigation, farming profit business, industry, preparing skilled manpower and improving the economic condition of the poor
 aay badhane se kray shakti badi, jisase puri arthvyavastha gatiman ho gai usee kaa laabh ab dikhaai de rahaa he
 How much importance do you see of leadership in this economic growth rate? The state was in the category of sick state, it knows the whole country
 man main ek jid, junun, jajba tha, ek sankalp tha ki pradesh ko aage badhayen
 Overall, there is a leadership role in this, but we acted with team spirit
 pradesh main team spirit paidaa kii or 'aao banaaen madhya pradesh' abhiyaan chalaaya, jisase aam naagarik ke man main bhav paidaa ho ki rajya ko banane main hamaara bhi yogadan ho
 This changed the mindset of the public and so did our team
 aap jaanate hi hai ki isamen nishchit taur par netritv kii bhoomika hoti hi hai
 How will the development of Madhya Pradesh look in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Assembly elections are due in 2013 and i think we will get the blessings of the people
 saath hi 2014 main bhi madhya pradesh desh main sarvaadhik loksabhaa kii siten jitkar degaa
 Last time BJP won 16 out of 29 seats in the state, how much will it be this time? See, it will not be right to say in numbers, but definitely we will move ahead from the previous figures and we will win the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats from the state and the party and the country
 Will give vikaas ke saath-saath madhya pradesh se bhrashtachar ke maamle bhi kaaphi sankhya main saamne aa rahe hai
 Has corruption increased with development or is there some other reason? Lokayukta law is so strong here that prima facie if it is disproportionate assets then raids, economic crime branch raids, Lokayukta raids
 meri taraf se hameshaa ichha rahati he ki gadabad he to jaanch ho, chaape maaro, sampatti jabt karo or use rajasat karo
 We have made a law to regulate property
 koun aisa rajya he jahaan itane chaape maare gaye hai?madhya pradesh se kai guna zyada bhrashtachar anya kahin mil jayega lekin aap chaape nahin maaroge yaa karrwai nahin karoge to vah dikhaai nahin degaa
 If other states take action, more corruption will emerge from Madhya Pradesh
 agar hamane galati ko pakad liya to ye hamaara kartavya he
 You tell me there is no corruption in Delhi? We are taking action against corruption
 hamane lokseva pradaay kanoon banaaya, jiskaa anusaran desh ke kai rajya kar rahe hai
 We created special courts to govern the property of the corrupt
 agar ham karpshan ke khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai to vah dikhaai detaa he, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki hamaare yahaan zyada he
 It is a matter of transparency, if you do not take action, it will not be seen
 rajya ne vikaas kii raah pakadi he, aise main shivaraj singh chouhan kii kalpana kaa madhya pradesh kaisaa hoga?janata kaa pratap ho, ram raaj ho
 Provision of bread, clothes, houses, medicines
 shiksha-swasthya ke maamle main pradesh behatar ho
 No one will be without treatment, without education
 sabko ucch koti kii shiksha mili
 Everybody should get employment, every field gets water, every hand should have work, this is my dream
 lekin keval itnaa nahin, ham sirf vikaas nahin karenge
 Along with development, we will also do the work of giving the sacrament, because many problems can be solved only by a cremated society
 charitra nirmaan, eemaandaaree, deshbhakti, karmthata is tarah ke maanviya gunon kaa vikaas ho sake
 Work for the state as well and we can contribute better in creating a better world
 main maanata hum ki madhya pradesh kii saadhe saat karod janata ko samrudh or viksit kar diya or wo thik disha main aage chal padi to apane desh kii samruddhi or vikaas main bhi rajya kii janata kaa mahatvapurn yogadan hoga, aisa hi madhya pradesh banane kii koshish karenge

 *** In a special conversation with NDTV, Ustad Ghulam Ali said, "there should be only a wall of love between the two countries and all the other walls should fall because the language of music in the whole world is one and there is no border
 mujhe ummid he ki donon deshon ke bich tazaa hawa zarur chalegi
 Asked how he accepted the invitation to sing in the temple, Ghulam Ali Sahab said, "where love is met or where someone remembers with love, singing is very important
 hamaara kaam hi gaanaa gaanaa he, phir chaahe wo mandir main ho yaa masjid main, isse kya ferq padataa he
 'ghulam Ali says,' Our worship is with mother and sister, it is also for Allah Taala and Hanuman ji
 mandir main gane se na meraa mazahab badalegaa na mahant ji kaa dharm badalegaa, in sabase upar he allaab yaa bhagwaan jo hamaare saath he

 'prof
 Mishra further said,' The language of music is one, and there is no border, so anyone who wants to come here is welcome
 
 
 hamaara koi nagina agar baahar he to ham use vaapis laane kii koshish zarur karenge
 If Hanuman ji feels that if he hears thumri from Ghulam Ali's mouth, what can i do? 'bismillah kaan ke bete zaamin khan ne bhi ghulaam ali sahab kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki ve is aitihaasik mandir main parform karne ja rahe hai
 This means that the blessings of the Sankatmochan temple are with them
 ghulaam ali ne donon deshon ke bich diwaar girane kii bhi ummid jataate hue kaha, ‘main 35 saalon se bharat aa rahaa hum or mujhe kabhi ye ekhsaas nahin hua ki ham pakistan se hai
 'ghulam Ali believes that' music is just music

 Those who are associated with music live in our heart and we keep those who love music with us
 'gulam ali ne ye bhi kaha ki, ‘donon deshon ke bich saanskrithik rishte banaae rakhana meri liye boj nahin zimmedaari he

 "unhone kaha ki somvaar shaam se kisaan apni maangon ko lekar rajya sarkaar se thos aashwaasan paane ke liye andolan kar rahe hai

 The Congress is having a big meeting on Friday before the Lok Sabha elections
 dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main ye baithak hogi, jisamen loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti par maathapai hogi
 This meeting will also approve the resolution passed by the Congress Working Committee, according to which Rahul Gandhi has been given the command of 'mission 2014'
 congress ne di parampara kii duhai
 
 
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, most of the leaders in the Congress Working Committee meeting to infuse the disappointed workers were in favor of declaring Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, but only then Sonia Gandhi came out and reiterated the tradition of bjp's Narendra Modi Rahul Gandhi was clearly saved from the contest
 rahul piem ummidavaar ke rup main project nahin honge lekin chunaav unheen kii aguwai main ladaa jayega
 That is, the party saved the scope that if the party waving the flag of success in the election, then there should be plenty of opportunities to make Rahul from prince to emperor
 bijepi ne saadhaa congress par nishanasch he ki congress kii ye parampara nahin rahi he, lekin chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad sonia gandhi ne hi parampara todane kaa sanket diya tha
 Then Sonia Gandhi had said that the prime ministerial candidate would be announced at the right time
 ab sonia gandhi ke liye to wo uchit vakt aayaa nahin lekin bijepi ko apni dhur virdohi party par nishaanaa saadhane kaa ekadam sahi mauka mil gaya
 The BJP attacked the Congress, saying that the party did not make anyone a PM candidate for fear of defeat
 bijepi kuch bhi kahe lekin congress kaa puraa faisla sochaa-samajha he
 He also saved Rahul from a direct fight against a veteran leader like Modi and in the event of success, the path of decorating the head on Rahul's head was also open
 bhaajapa mahasachiv ram madhav ne shanivaar ko jammu main filmi andaaj main vipaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki hamaare paas modi he
 He said that nobody in the opposition camp has the capacity like Prime Minister Modi

 However, he mistakenly called it Amitabh Bachchan's dialogue instead of Shashi Kapoor, while Shashi Kapoor spoke it in the film
 riyasi jile main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue unhone is baat par jor diya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh ko ''bhrashtachar or aatankwaad mukt'' banaaya or pakistan main ghuskar aatankwaadiyon ke bich khauf paidaa kiya
 Madhav said that the opposition has no leader, but we have Modi
 yahi kaaran he ki ve (gathbandhan) kar rahe hai
 His attempt to form a grand alliance failed because many people in the opposition are eyeing the Prime Minister's chair
 kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko udhampur loksabhaa seat se phir se chunaav jitaane kii apil karte hue madhav ne kaha ki vah (vipaksh) modi ko satta se kyon hataanaa chahta he? kyonki modi ne desh ko bhrashtachar or aatankwaad mukt banaaya or vah chaahate hai ki har naagarik apane pairon par khadaa ho or pragatisheel desh kaa hissaa bane

 After coming to India, St
 Thomas built 7 churches

 But the people of Chennai did not accept the new religion
 ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki iske baad yahaan ke logon ne sentthomsapar atyaachaar karnaa shuru kar diya or ek gupha main unka katl kar diya gaya
 This place in Chennai is still famous today as St
 Thomas Mount

 It is believed that when St

 crude oil kshetra main vaishvik str ke jaankaron kaa daawa he ki bahut jald crude oil 100 dollar prati bairal ke paar bhi nikal saktaa he
 In such a situation, what is the need to be prepared that very soon the price of petrol will reach the level of Rs 100 per liter in the country
 global market main crude oil ke liye saal 2012 se 2017 tak kaa safar desh kii raajnneeti ke liye gemeanger sabit hua he
 Where global crude oil prices increased the challenges of the previous Congress government so much that in 2014 the government had to face defeat in the elections on the issue of inflation
 vahiin 2014 main chunaav ke nateezon aate hi kendra main bani nai bijepi sarkaar ke liye global crude oil kii keemten vardaan sabit hui
 Amidst this ups and downs, while the price of crude oil fell from $ 125 per barrel to $ 30 per barrel in the global market, the price of petrol in the country went from Rs 76 to Rs 56 per liter
 ab ek baar phir global market main crude kii keemton main sudhaar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 gamechanger: Manmohan's fall and Modi's boon During the Manmohan Singh government's tenure in 2012, crude oil rose to $ 125 a barrel in the international market and remained at $ 100 a barrel until the 2014 general elections
 april 2014 main chunaav hue or crude kii keemton main phislan kii bhi shuruyaat hui
 This slippery, which began in May 2014, soon after the election results brought down the price of crude from $ 100 a barrel to $ 50 a barrel by December 2015
 yah phislan yaheen nahin khatm hoti
 Crude oil prices fell to their all-time low of $ 30 a barrel by January 2016
 gauratlab he ki kachche tel kii keemten kendra sarkaar ke khajaane se kharch kaa sabase bada or sabase ahm kharch he
 Here, every penny left is used for the government to pursue its economic and social policies
 ise bhi padhein: notebandi, vitt mantralay, rigerv bank or rashtriya bhrambite 3 saal ke utaar-chadhaav main petrol kii keemtadesh main petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit karne kaa niyam badal chukaa he
 Where previously, the price of petrol was determined every two months by adding tax along with estimation of import cost per month
 iske baad is formule par petrol kii keemat prati maah or phir prati saptaah nirdhaarit kii jane lagi
 But for the past two months, the price of petrol per day is determined by the fluctuations of crude oil in the global market and the assessment of tax in the country
 lihaaja in teen saal ke dauraan crude kii keemton main baari pherbadal se petrol kii keemat main bhi utaar-chadhaav kaa silsilaa bana rahaa he
 In 2012, when the price of crude oil was at the top, petrol in Delhi was selling from Rs 73 to Rs 67 per liter
 vahiin jab 2014 main crude oil kii keemton main phislan shuru hui to puure saal ke dauraan dilli main petrol kii keemat 73 rupee se 63 rupee prati litre tak bechaa gaya
 The first benefit of this slippery of 2014 to the common man started in 2015
 jahaan crude 30 dollar prati bairal ke str par pahunch gaya vahiin dilli main prati litre petrol kii keemat pehali baar 60 rupee prati litre ke neeche gai
 However, the price of petrol ranged from Rs 66 to Rs 60 per liter throughout the year
 2016 main oktober tak saste petrol kaa khel khatm ho gaya or yahaan se ek baar phir petrol kii keemton main badhottaree shuru ho gai
 During this time, the price of one liter of petrol rose from Rs 66 to Rs 70 and during 2017, petrol price again went up from Rs 70 per liter to Rs 63 per liter
 ise bhi padhein: china bharose modi kii saubhaahgya yojana, 24 ghante bijli ke liye 10 karod dollar karj ko manjuuri100 dollar prati bairal hua crude to 100 rupee litre hoga petrol?vaishvik sanstha orgenigeshan for iconomic kooparation and deveopment (oisidi) kii bhavishyavaanee he ki maujuuda vaishvik aarthik sthiti main 2020 tak crude oil kii keemat 270 dollar prati bairal tak ja sakati he
 Significantly, in 2008, crude oil was at an all-time high of $ 145 per barrel
 vahiin 2015 or 2016 ke dauraan khadi deshon main jari vivaad or china samet vikasshil deshon main maang kii kami ke chalate crude oil kii keemat 30 dollar prati bairal ke str par pahunch gai
 The basis of the oecd's prediction is that economies like China and India could increase the demand for fuel significantly in the coming years
 baharhaal, bharat main petrol kii keemat 100 rupee kaa paar jane ke liye jaruri nahin ki crude oil is str ko chhue
 For the last three years, the price of crude in the country and the tax being charged by the Central and State Governments can bring the price of petrol to 100 rupees at the same time once the crude oil touches the 2014 level i

 $ 100 per barrel

 India's wrist spinners duo Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav are on top with 12 wickets in the current ODI series
 shuruaati teen vanade main donon kii phiraki is kadar chali ki africa lagaataar dher hote gaye or team india ne chah vanade maichon kii siries main 3-0 kii badhat hasil kar lee
 But something happened in the fourth ODI that the failure of these two became the reason for the defeat of Team India
 johanisburg vanade main team india kii haar, 5 wicket se jeeta south africadarasal, chahal or kuldeep johanisburg vanade ke dauraan match ke sabase mahange gendbaaj sabit hue
 Chahal would not have even dreamed that he would score more than 12 runs in every over, while Kuldeep scored 8
 50 ran prati over kharch kiye
 Chahal's bowling analysis 5
 3-0-68-1 rahaa, jabaki kuldeep kaa 6-0-51-2
 It is interesting that in the first three odis, Chahal and Kuldeep had a total of 13 boundaries on the balls, including 4 sixes
 lekin akele chauthe vanade main south africa ballebaajon ne 14 boundry jad di, jinamein 8 chakke bhi hai
 Another mistake Chahal made was when David Miller was bowled by Chahal, but it was a no ball
 no ball se miller ko jeevandaan mil gaya
 At that time he was just 7 runs
 aakhirkaar miller ne 39 ran banaakar team ko jeet ke kareeb pahunchaa diya
