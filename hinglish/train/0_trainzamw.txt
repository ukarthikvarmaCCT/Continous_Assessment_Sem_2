 unhone vidhansabha main ek artiai kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sarkaar ek saptaah ke bheetar teen lakh 19 hajaar chaar sau chuuhe maare jane kaa daawa kar rahi he
 If more than nine tons of rats are killed every day, then how were they killed? khadse ne is maamle kii jaanch kii maang kii he
 Khadse said that it seems that there have been scams in the tender of death of rats and the departments from which this tender was passed are under the General Administration Department and Home Department run under the Chief Minister

 ye aarope bhi lagaae khadse ne
 
 
 Khadse did not stop this
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki jis company ko chuuhe maarane kaa tender diya gaya usne 7 din main 3 lakh se zyada chuuhe kaise maar die
 In this work, the time of 6 months is also reduced
 khadse ne aage sawaal kiya ki jis company ko chuuhe maarane kaa theka mila tha uske paas mantralay main jehar laane kii anumati nahin thi
 How was the poison brought into the ministry without the permission of the Home Department and the General Administration Department? aap computer yuj kar rahe hai or router ke jariye connected hai

 It is fine if you understand, but if you do not understand yet, then understand that you should avoid clicking a popup containing an advertisement
 kyonki aap to hack honge hi or saath hi router se jude sabhi divaais ke yugers bhi hack ho jaaenge

 This kit, named dnschanger, is being transported to the people by being hidden in the image ad image
 agar aapako yaad ho to 2012 main isi dnschanger nelakhon computers ko prabhavit kiya tha
 dnschanger replaces the DNS of affected computers which is different from the DNS provided by the Internet service provider
 isse ataikars divaais ko control main le sakate hai
 After this, the users of the affected computer opens a website, then they are taken to a website which is infected by attackers instead of the original website
 itnaa hi nahin havers yahaan apni marji koi vigyaapan dikhaa sakate hai
 Once you click this affected ad, your router is affected along with it and the malware transforms itself into a DNS server controlled by the attacker
 iske jariye isse duusare divaais par bhi havers kaa kabja ho saktaa he
 Researchers have released a list of some routers who are weak and are also suffering
 haalanki philhal yah saaf nahin he ki kitne log or divaais isse prabhavit hai, lekin security form kaa kahana he ki calf pehle yah mailaware 1 din main 1 million computers ko apni chapet liya tha
 To avoid these, keep updating your router's firmware ie software from time to time
 kyonki isi apadet ke jariye company security ptch detii he jo aapke liye jaruri he
 The owners of the circus industry, which were once a special source of entertainment for the children as well as the elders, fear that the circus industry may not cease to exist due to the information revolution and neglect of the government
 bhartiya sarkas sangh or europea sarkas sanghathan (isie) ke sadsy rambo sarkas ke maalik sujith dilip ne bataaya, ‘‘is udyog ko bharat main jivit rakhane ke liye is samay sarkaar or korporate praayojakon ke sahyog kii jarurat he
 The industry is dying due to lack of favorable environment and necessary facilities
 ’’unhone kaha ki hamaare desh main sarkas udyog aisi samasyaon se jujh rahaa he jinhen yadi sahi dhang se nahin suljhaayaa gaya to yah udyog samaapt ho saktaa he
 Vinod Kumar, the manager of the Great Bombay Circus, says, "think for yourself why people would want to come to see the circus now
 har ghar main tivi he, bachche internet ke jaankaar hai
 The parents have no time
 agar samay hota bhi he, to ve apane bacchon ko ghumaane ke liye park yaa koi duusari jagah le janaa chaahate hai, jisase unki jaankaree bade
 "they say" were the main attractive animals of the circus, which the children were happy to see
 ab sarkas main jaanwaron ke rakhane par manaahi he, isiilie hamane apane sabhi pashu bahut pehle hi chidyaghar ke supurd kar die hai
 Children used to like stunts, but now kids like action Hollywood movies
 sarkas ke stant main kisi ko dilchaspee nahin rahi

 He said that the industry is also facing a shortage of artists after the ban on children's performances in the circus
 vinod kehete hai ki rus main sarkas aaj bhi lokapriy he
 This is also the reason
 vahaan sarkaar ne sarkas udyog ko kaaphi madad di he
 a location in the city is given for the circus
 hamaare yahaan manoranjan kar kii maang to khub hoti he lekin suvidha jaraa bhi nahin di jaati
 They say that earlier when the circus used to be held in the city, its posters would have been installed many days ago
 iske alaava sarkas dal or jaanwaron ko lekar prabandhan ek juluus nikaalata tha
 Now if the circus goes somewhere, it becomes difficult to find a place
 iske liye aavedan karne ke baad lanbaa intjaar karnaa hota he
 According to Vinod, nothing can be done until the government helps to save the circus industry
 ise manoranjan kar se puri tarah mukt kar diya janaa chahie or iske liye shahar main kam se kam dar par sthaan muhaiyaa karana chahie

 pehle atakalein chali thim, phir sanket die gaye the, or phir priyanka gandhi wadra ne khud bhi kah diya tha ki agar party (congress) chaahegi, to vah varanasi se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladengi, lekin aakhirkaar ab aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 His elder brother and Congress President Rahul Gandhi is seated in the highest position to make decisions in his party, and his mother Sonia Gandhi has the power to 'veto', if possible, dinner talks at home, or several times After the discussion, it was decided
 pasand saaf thi
 Fighting in front of the most powerful leader of the country would have been a great start to his political career
 haar bhi jaatin, to yah tay tha ki unhen 'prashikshu' rajaneta kii tarah nahin, gambhir, majboot or ladane main sakasham aakraamak netaaon kii qatari main shumaar kiya jaataa, jo mushkil muqablon se nahin kataraate hai
 Had she been able to narrow the margin of Modi's victory, she would surely have proved to be the same 'brahmastra' of the Congress, which has been given to her by her fans in the party
 baharhaal, ab to vah hathiyaar istemaal hi nahin kiya gaya
 
 
 So, now think, why Priyanka Gandhi Vadra retreated
 
 
 ?is aalekh ke liye jin congress netaaon se maine baat kii, unhone mujhe is kisse ke do sanskaran bataae
 a senior leader involved in the decision-making process says Priyanka was never seriously involved in the race, and her candidature against Narendra Modi was not even discussed at the top level in the party
 utsahit kaaryakartaaon kii ore se yah ek maang yaa aagrah ke rup main shuru hua tha, or bhai-bahan ke bayaan sirf kaaryakartaaon ke josh ko badaye rakhane or BJP ko kanfus karne ke liye die gaye the
 But since the story of the 'modi vs Priyanka' battle was started by Priyanka, and the 'inner people of Congress' kept it alive, and then both Rahul and Priyanka spoke openly about this, so believe this theory It is difficult to do
 ek anya netaa kaa kahana he, priyanka to ladanaa chaahati thim, lekin rahul or sonia unka rajnatik kariyar ek haar ke saath shuru karwaane kii icchhuk nahin the
 Many internal surveys showed that Modi is invincible in Varanasi, and despite this, Priyanka used to think differently from her family
 ek varisht congress netaa ke mutabik, agar rahul gandhi amethi (uttar pradesh) or vynad (kerala), donon siton par jeet jate hai, to priyanka ko amethi main hone vaale upachunaav main ladaaya jayega
 But are the real leaders hidden behind so many shields and security cycles? 
 
 ? haarana or jeetna to jananetaaon ke saath hota hi he
 Ask this question, and the Congress has no answer
 uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan ke tahat varanasi loksabhaa seat samaajawaadee party (SP) ke khate main ai thi, or SP adhyaksh akhilesh yadav khushi-khushi priyanka gandhi wadra ko sanyukt gathbandhan pratyaashee maanakar unke samarthan main apane halke-phulke pratyaashee ko hataane ko taiyaar the
 After the family put an end to the possibility of Varanasi, the party leaders are now saying that Priyanka will campaign vigorously in the 18 seats where the Congress is likely to win
 agar yah maanakar chalaa jaae ki modi hi BJP ke pramukh prachaarak hai, to unhen varanasi main baandhakar rakh dena bhi priyanka kii jeet hi mana jayega
 This second twist given to the same story seems to be a fantasy that by not making Priyanka Gandhi contest the election, the Congress actually wants to help the Grand Alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 gathbandhan kii madad karne kaa behtareen tarika to yah hota ki uttar pradesh main amethi or raibareli ko chhodkar congress kisi bhi seat se chunaav hi nahin ladati, or har jagah ladaai ko BJP banaam sanyukt vipaksh bana diya hota
 But instead the Congress will cut votes from the Grand Alliance
 aankade bataate hai ki trikoniya muqablon main BJP ko hameshaa laabh mila he
 Now it has become a habit of the Congress that it stops after reaching the worst situation

 While requesting to take the relevant part of the Department of Telecommunications affidavit filed before the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) to the court records, the company contended that the document was important for judicial decision in the criminal case against it
 LTL ne daayar kiya tha halafanamltiel ne kaha ki uske dwaara tidisat main daayar ek yachika ke jawaab main doorsanchaar vibhaag ke jariye centre sarkaar dwaara yah halafanama daakhil kiya gaya tha

 kitaab: mairi me stranger (nowell)bhashaa: angrejilekhak: navneel chakravartiprakashak: random house indiakimat: 105 rupee'mairi me, stranger' romance kii koi saamaanya kahani nahin he
 It may look like a one-time name, but a ring made of barbed wire on the cover page leaves many questions in mind
 yah ek ladki kaa peechha karne vaale us ajanabi ke bare main he, jisaki koi aawaaj, koi cheharaa, naam yaa pahchaan nahin thi
 But there was definitely a motive
 kolkata kii ek ladki he, rivaana banerjee
 She comes to Mumbai in connection with work
 paraye shahar main bhi jindagi uski thik-thaak hi chal rahi thi, lekin phir entry letaa he peechha karne vaala ek ajanabi
 However one wonders that she is not shocked at all by this thing at the beginning
 yaa shaayad maujuuda daur main itnaa bhi ascharyajanak nahin, jahaan peechha karne waalon kii bharmaar he or log virtual duniya ke logon par bhi yakeen kar baithte hai
 Well, this 'stranger' who seemed to be the main character of the story was not dangerous at all, as he helped Rivana many times
 'har cheez kii keemat chukaani padati he', rivaana ko yah chetate or kai baar dhamkaate hue vah pathakon ko bhi saavdhaan kar detaa he
 Rivana knows nothing about him and maintains his ways of being and pursuing her
 lekin phir ek din dhamkee ke baad vah is bare main kuch karne kaa faisla leti he
 The book is written in very easy English
 haalanki shuruyaat main kuch gairajaruri byore bhi hai, jaise us cab sarvice kaa naam jiskaa istemaal rivaana karti he yaa kisi local restraan kaa naam
 These names have no relation to the plot of the story and only create this hindrance at the level of communication
 haalanki jab kahani tamaam dilachasp pahaluon ko sametate hue aage badhati he to aap ise padhate chale jate hai
 Details of characters with different personalities are also given in detail
 udhaaharan ke taur par rivaana ek majboot, aatmanirbhar, vichaarsheel or apni jindagi main behad santulit ladki najar aati he
 But in front of her friend Ishita, who has been living in Mumbai for some time, she seems like a small town submissive girl with prejudices
 dil ke dukhane or virah se ubarne ke dauraan vah apni shakhsiyat ke nae pahalu se rubaru hoti he
 All with the help of that stranger
 kitaab main pyaar, vishwaas, judaai, khushi, santosh, dukh or dar jaise dher sari bhavanaaen aati or ghulti-milti rahati hai
 a virgin girl living in a big city definitely finds herself attached to these feelings
 ajanabi use jindagi ke kai jaruri sabak detaa he or rivaana ke saath aap bhi is bare main sochane lagate hai
 At one place, he tells Rivana, "if your heart is not hurt very badly, then you cannot learn
 tum gro nahin kar saktin
 If you can't grow then you can't live
 agar ji nahin saktin to tumhen apni keemat nahin pataa lagegi
 'but who is this stranger? Why is he helping Rivana? Is he a boy? Does Rivana have any relationship with strangers in their night dreams? Navneel deals with these questions efficiently and cleverly
 ajanabi kaa raaj jaanane ke liye hamen is siries kii aagaamee do kitabon kaa intjaar karnaa padegaa
 The book is not part of any intellectual reading, nor is there a 'masterpiece' in terms of language
 lekin yah nae daur kii ek halki, manoranjak or exciting kahani kaa chaalaak bayaan jarur he

 desh main dijal kaaron kii keemton main 80 hajaar rupee tak kaa ijapha ho saktaa he
 The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has sent a proposal to impose additional excise duty of 80 thousand rupees on diesel cars
 iske alaava mantralay ne dijal kii khapat kam karne ke liye liquyphid natural gas par emport duty main paanch fisadi ke chhot dene kaa bhi prastaav bheja he
 The Ministry hopes that if the Finance Ministry incorporates these proposals in the budget of 2012–2013, the government's revenue will increase as well as the consumption of diesel in the country will also be reduced considerably
 yah prastaav kirit paarikh cameti kii report ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 Apart from this, the ministry has also sent a proposal to give a rebate of five per cent in import duty on liquid natural gas to reduce diesel consumption
 mantralay ko ummid he ki 2012−2013 ke bajet main agar vitt mantralay in prastaavon ko shaamil kar letaa he, to sarkaar kii revenyu main to badhotaree hogi hi saath hi desh main dijal kii khapat bhi kaaphi kam hogi
 The proposals have been prepared on the basis of the report of the Kirit Parikh Committee
 akele rahane vaale yaa soshal media par kam sakriy rahane log dikhne main thode boring lagate hai, lekin in logon main ek dilachasp khaasiyat hoti he
 a research has revealed that people who keep reserves themselves, ie less soluble people, are more intelligent
 yah shodh world economic forum ne kii he
 This research has been done on more than 15 thousand people between 18 and 28 years
 is shodh main unki jindagi se jude kuch khaas sawaal-jawaab bhi kiye gaye
 How much they like to meet people or how much population lives around them, some such questions were asked in research
 shodh main pataa laga ki aise logon ko zyada bheed pasand nahin he
 Many people feel suffocated between them and they do not adapt themselves to that environment
 shodh kii maane to zyaadaatar budhimaan vyaktiyon ko doston ke saath lagaataar jude rahane se kam hi santushti milti he
 There can be many reasons for these people to remain in reserve
 shaayad buddhijivi log apane kaam par focus karne main zyada vishwaas rakhte hai
 The second reason may be that they need to recharge themselves like introverted people

 When treatment began and he had to undergo annoying liver biopsies, injections and drug use, he questioned his doctors, "why did i not find any signs of the disease
" ” doctoron kaa jawaab tha, ''liver ke maamle main aisa hi hota he
 "if your stomach starts coming out of your chest more, if you have difficulty bending and tying your shoelace, if you are not able to put your shirt properly inside the pants, then it is a direct sign that fat in your body Volume is increasing
 ham bharatiyon ke liye yah to koi nai baat nahin he

 doctor ek aise ang par dikhaai na dene vaali charbi ke khatre kii chetavanee de rahe hai, jiske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa: vah he liver
 Complaints of fatty liver disease are increasing rapidly in cities of India
 is tarah ke fatty liver se dil kaa daura padane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, it can also cause cancer
 liver kii yah beemaari kitni gambhir ho chuki he, iskaa andaja in tathyon se lagaaya ja saktaa he :*32 fisadi bharatiyon main kuch had tak fatty liver kii beemaari hone kaa anumaan he
 * 70 to 90 percent of obese and diabetic people suffer from fatty liver disease
 *54 fisadi log, jo na sharir or na hi pet ke motaape se grast hai, fatty liver ke rogi hai
 * 24 percent of Indian men are affected by fatty liver, while 13 percent of such women are

 * Urban Indians are at double risk of death or heart attack due to liver fat
 *bharat main liver kii gambhir beemaari main fatty liver teesraa sabase bada kaaran he
 * Indians have twice the amount of fat than people of equal weight in Western countries

 Director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Science (ILBS) in Delhi, Dr
 shiv sareen, jo non-alcoholic fatty liver dijis (eneefeldi) par global guidelins ke sah-lekhak rah chuke hai, kehete hai, ''ab vasayukta liver kaa khatra sirf un logon tak hi simit nahin rah gaya he, jo bahut zyada sharaab pite hai
 "his book is published in June this year from the World Gastroenterology Organization
 ve kehete hai, ''nakaaratmak jivan style se baio-chemical riection paidaa ho rahaa he
 Which is causing fatty liver disease
 agar ham sachet nahin hue to yah jaldi hi bharat main ek mahamari kaa rup le sakati he, kyonki iskaa ab tak koi ilaaj nahin he
 "studies suggest that Indian men may be particularly prey to fatty liver
 motaape kii samasya main liver ek nadaarad kadi he or is kshetra main ab nae research kii gati bad rahi he
 Due to the absence of any study at the all-india level, the research is being done in pieces, this problem is becoming more complicated
 dilli ke fortis hospital main motopa, madhumeh or metabolic bimariyon ke vibhaag ke pramukh dow
 Says Anoop Mishra, "pubmed on the Internet (pubmed is an internet search, including 2
 2 karod biomedical uddhran maujuud hai) non-alcoholic fatty liver kaa medical data search karne par 1995 main keval 14 or 2000 main 36 research paper mili
 More than 200 articles are being published on this subject every year in the last five years
 ” ve kehete hai, ''isse pehle liver main fat kaa jamaa hona ahaanikar samaj jaataa tha, lekin aaj ise khatarnaak mana ja rahaa he
 Dr
 of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh
 ajay duseja ke mutabik, bharat main fatty liver kii pahchaan haal hi main ek beemaari ke taur par kii gai he
 Very little research has been published on this subject
 iskaa kaaran shaayad yahi he ki pehle ise ahaanikar mana jaataa tha or yah samaj jaataa tha ki yah aage nahin failati he
 Apart from this, all the attention was being given to viral hepatitis

 Sameeran Nandi, who heads the Department of Surgical Gastro & Liver Transplant Department at Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi, says this is very common as it is the second largest organ worker in the body
 liver na to dhadkta he or na hi isaki nabj chalati he, na yah aawaaj karata he or na sikudta he
 Unlike the heart, it can also work under pressure
 liver jitne jatil kaam karata he, vah sab achche swasthya ke liye behad mahatvapurn hai
 It also does not indicate any pressure on him, unless there is a serious mess with him
 dow
 Says Nandi, "the lever has tremendous power to reinforce and heal itself
" ” nuksaan ke baavjood yah varshon tak kaam kar saktaa he, lekin ek samay ke baad yah nuksaan liver ko itnaa bigaad chukaa hota he ki uskaa thik hona asambhav ho jaataa he
 That is why doctors call liver diseases as silent killers
 fatty liver kii beemaari tab shuru hoti he, jab vasa ke anu liver kii koshikaon main jamaa ho jate hai
 This is due to obesity and diabetes
 research se pataa chalata he ki motaape or diabetes se peedit 70 se 90 fisadi log is beemaari se grast hote hai
 Fatty liver disease remains silent for years
 ek baar jab yah us vyakti ko ho jaati he, jo sharaab nahin peetaa yaa prati din 20 gram se bhi kam sharaab peetaa he to doctor ise non alcoholic steohepatitis (steo kaa matlab vasa or hepatitis kaa matlab sujan he) yaa eneese kehete hai
 If the NASH causes so much damage to the liver that it cannot be cured, it can lead to cirrhosis, the liver may stop functioning, or even cancer
 pehle se yah bataanaa asambhav he ki kise serosis ho saktaa he or kise cancer
 But the longer the fatty liver disease remains hidden, the greater the risk of disease
 fatty liver kii beemaari motaape kaa nateeja he, lekin yah hameshaa ek khaas rup main hi nahin najar aati
 Liver fat can also occur in people who have neither excess weight nor increased belly
 2010 main kolkata main institute of postagraduate medical ajukeshan and research ke shodhakartaaon dwaara namoonay ke taur par kareeb do hajaar logon par kiye gaye ek adhyayan se chintajanak nattejey saamne aae: fatty liver kii beemaari se grast 75 fisadi logon kaa body maas index (oonchai ke mutabik vajan) saamaanya se kam tha, jabaki 54 pratishat logon kaa vajan zyada nahin tha
 Doctors say that nearly 90 percent of heart diseases are caused by nine risk factors — smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, diabetes, abnormal obesity, psychological causes, inadequate diet, drinking alcohol, and lack of regular physical activity
 ab fatty liver ko dasvaan kaarak mana jane laga he
 According to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, inflammation of the liver damages the inner part of the arteries and creates blood clots
 sareen kehete hai, ''yah sab milakar heart atake kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Obesity attacked India in the 1990s
 yah tab kii baat he, jab dilli main pehle videshi food chen ne apni dukaan kholi thi
 In the last two decades, when people's income has increased four times, the country's hunger has also increased
 sanyukt raashtra ke phu da and agriculture orgenigeshan (eggeo) se praapt food balance data se pataa chalata he ki mote anaaj kii jagah polish kiye gaye anaaj ne le lee he, jabaki 1990 ke baad se bharat ke sampann shaharon main maance, fat or chini kii khapat doguni se bhi zyada bad chuki he
 Consumption of animal products in the form of food has increased the energy, but due to mechanical facilities, the physical activity of the people has come down drastically
 aahaar kii is badalati chunauti ko dekhte hue liver ko hone vaala nuksaan sharir kii mand pratikriya ko darshata he
 According to the World Health Organization, liver disease in India kills two lakh people every year
 yah mrityu ke 10 sabase bade kaarnon main se ek he
 Hospital records show that fatty liver plays one-third of such cases
 durbhaagya se fatty liver kii beemaari yaa eneese kaa ab tak koi ilaaj nahin he
 Changes in diet, physical activity and weight loss are the only hope
 dow
 Mishra says, "keeping body weight low is beneficial
 ” lekin teji se vajan ghatane se bhi liver ko nuksaan hota he
 However, it is not the case that in the case of fatty liver, there is no cloud of hope everywhere
 is kshetra se jude kaaryakarta or doctor skulon main jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai or satta ke galiyaaron main bhi jaakar rasukhdaar logon or antarrashtriya swasthya sanghathanon ko desh kii is nai samasya ke prati aagaah kar rahe hai

 The Union Health Ministry has asked the Ministry of Human Resource Development to ensure the removal of junk food from schools and college canteens
 ab campason main 'junk da junk food’ kaa naaraa sunai detaa he
 Urban India now needs to go on a fast, but no change is going to happen with a single effort
 iske liye vyapak jaagrukta abhiyaan kii jarurat he
 Only then our food habits can change significantly
 abhi tak doctor is baat se khush hai ki adhikansh fatty liveron ne ugr rup nahin dhaaran kiya he
 But if it becomes fierce it will mean the end of life

 Rahul Gandhi criticized the Finance Minister's statement in Parliament saying, "what do you eat? Has anyone asked? Rahul Gandhi has taken a dig at the statement made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament regarding onions
" 'what do you eat, someone asked you? Eat whatever you want to eat, but you are the Finance Minister of the country, explain to the country why there is maximum unemployment in 45 years? Why is the farmer committing suicide? Why are you not getting employment? Rahul said that she does not make all this, but rather says that 'no i will not explain, i do not eat onions, i do not eat garlic
 'congress bachaayegi aapaki jameenrahul gandhi ne jameen adhigrahan ke masale par modi sarkaar ko gheraa
 Rahul said that on one side there is BJP which works for the rich, while on the other side there is Congress which works for poverty-farmers
 rahul ne janata se kaha ki ye nirnay aapako karnaa he ki aap aisi sarkaar chaahate hai jo jameen chhinakar amiron ko de yaa congress kii sarkaar, jo jameen bachaane ke liye adhigrahan bill lekar ai
 Giving the example of Chhattisgarh, Rahul said that the Congress government there took a historic decision
 rahul ne bataaya ki ek company ne jameen lekar bhi paanch saal main udyog nahin lagaaya, hamane adhigrahan bill lagu kiya or company se jameen waapas lekar kisaanon ko de di
 The debt of farmers will be waived, the rate of paddy will be Rs 2500 and the land of the farmers will be protected

 Apart from this, the state exchequer is also being defrauded by conniving with health card holders
 in sabake bich sarkari aspataalon main dallalon or agenton kii bhi ban ai he
 These broker health card holders show a healthy person hospitalized as a patient and take out a hefty amount by scratching the card
 is rakam kaa aadha hissaa aspataal or dalal jabaki shesh rakam health card dharak ke bich baant diya jaataa he
 Health card holders are also receiving healthy cash from brokers and hospital agents by scratching their smart cards within the stipulated period
 bagaiyr ilaaj kiye kuch aspataal aadhi rakam us shaks ko nakad de rahe hai, to kuch aspataal maatr 10,000 rupee vasuul kar shesh 40 hajaar kii rakam lautaa de rahe hai
 Claims of fully healthy card holders are also being prepared as patients
 swasth vyakti aspataal ke dastavejon main apane hastakshar or angootha lagaakar khud ko marij sabit karata he
 Then the hospital staff are taking advantage of the insurance claim by preparing fake documents related to its treatment under the health insurance scheme
 is tarah ke farji clem se swasthya beemaa yojana bhrashtachar kii bhent chadh gai he
 The disease is small but untreated, hospitals are offering arbitrary treatment to the maximum amount of money under the Health Insurance Scheme, instead many patients are being treated through unnecessary and complicated and expensive procedures to recover the amount of smart card
 haal hi main 'public health risource network' dwaara kiye gaye survey ne puri yojana kii pole khol di he
 This was revealed after a survey conducted in different districts of the state

 The Chhattisgarh government started the scheme in 2009 to provide free treatment to the poor
 shuruyaat main health card dharakon ko 30 hajaar rupee tak muft ilaaj diya ja rahaa tha
 Later, the government increased the insurance amount from 30 thousand rupees to 50 thousand rupees
 jaise hi yah rakam badi, vaise hi yah yojana nijee kshetra ke kai aspataalon ke liye aay kaa jariya ban gai
 According to State Health Convenor Sulakshana Nandi of Public Health Resource Network, the health of the health services has worsened in Chhattisgarh due to the insurance scheme
 rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana ko smart card dekarcash-lasbanaaya gaya tha
 But this scheme has now become a discount scheme
 udhar rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana ke state nodel adhikari vijendra kataare kaa kahana he ki sandigdh aspataalon ke clem kaa audit karaayaa ja rahaa he
 At present, this scheme is proving to be a boon for private hospitals rather than patients

 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi's laundry Chand Abdul Salam Dhobi is wishing to become his Prime Minister
 vah chahta he ki chunaav kii prakriya jald hi puri ho jaae toki use godhra main makaan banane ke liye plot mili
 This news has been given by an English newspaper
 chand ne 2009 main ganatantr diwas ke avasar par narendra modi se mulaakaat kii thi
 He then applied for the plot
 modi ne adhikariyon se khaas taur se kahkar use bulawaaya tha
 It was only after that meeting that Chand, living in poverty, demanded a plot

 76-year-old Chand's nephew now looks after the laundry

 Chand has two documents according to him that the district administration has fixed a plot for him in Lilesara Panchayat
 yah jagah godhra ke bahari kshetra main he
 But the problem in this is that the permission of the state government is needed to give a plot of more than Rs 20,000
 is plot kii keemat 2,58,800 rupee he
 a proposal for this has been sent to the state government
 ab chand ko itane paison kii vyavastha kerani hogi

 According to diplomatic sources, the Prime Minister's first stop will be in France on 10 April, where 'make in India' will be the main agenda for discussion
 france apni tej gati kii rail seva 'tijivi' ke liye vikhyath he, haalanki vah apni madhyam gati kii rail praudyogiki ko bhi bharat ke saath saajha karnaa chahega
 The Ministry of Railways has announced the purchase of electric multiple units (EMU) trains from global contractors and its focus is mainly on Germany, France and Spain, where these metro trains are popular
 
 ek aadhikarik sutara ne bataaya ki shuruyaat main kharidari purna nirmit trainon ke puure set kii ho sakati he, haalanki saath main praudyogiki sthanantaran ko lekar bhi saajhedaari ho sakati he, jisase bharat baad main desh main hi is tarah kii trainon kaa nirmaan kar sake
 These metro trains running on existing broad gauge rail tracks can have a speed of 130 to 150 kilometers per hour

 amuman in upnagareey metro trainon ke do dibbon main aisi motor lagi hoti hai
 The average speed of Rajdhani trains running in the country is 90 km per hour, but due to the fast track speed and good brake system, the average speed of metro trains will be from 130 to 150 km per hour

 The Aam Aadmi Party has launched the i Fund Honest Party Challenge on the lines of the 'swachh Bharat' campaign in view of the Delhi Assembly elections
 is campan main jo bhi yah chunauti legaa, vah aam aadmi party ko chanda dekar 10 or logon se party ko chanda dilaaegaa
 The campaign was started by Arvind Kejriwal, the National Convenor of the party itself and former Chief Minister of Delhi
 unhone party ko 10 hazaar rupee kaa chanda diya or 10 logon ko nominete kiya
 These include industrialist Rajiv Bajaj and names like actress and party leader Gul Panag
 arvind kejariwal ke mutabik, jaise 'svachh bharat' abhiyaan he, aise hi svachh raajnneeti abhiyaan he
 
 
 Until politics is cleared, the country will not be clean
 kejariwal ke mutabik agar koi bada corporate gharaana chande kii badi rakam detaa he, to baad main iskaa phayda bhi uthaata he, kyonki raajnneetik partiyaan chanda lene kaa tarika paardarshee nahin rakhti
 
 
 This is why in today's politics there is a lack of decision making for the public
 kejariwal ne udhaaharan dekar bataaya ki agar koi bijli company kisi party ko chanda degi, to chunaav ke baad vah chaahegi ki bijli ke rate bade
 
 
 
 or janata agar paisa or vot degi, to chaahegi ke rate ghate
 That is why we are asking for money from the public
 kejariwal ne yah bhi kaha ki vah kisi company ke khilaaf nahin hai, lekin vah kisi corporate se bada chanda sweekaar nahin karenge, jisase chunaav ke baad corporate unase koi aisa kaam galat tareeke se karaane ke liye na kahe
 Kejriwal said that his method is transparent, whereas the BJP people never mention the names of their donors
 unhone yah bhi mana ki yah muhim raajnneetik he or duusari partiyon par dabaav banane kaa ek tarika bhi he
 In fact, three aspects of the strategy of the Aam Aadmi Party are visible in this campaign - some money also comes, some people also get involved and the party's agenda of clean politics goes a little further
 dekhnaa he, vipaksh is ranneeti kii kya kaat khojataa he

 ) There is a strange impatience in the sky, not knowing how the fate of London will change in the Olympics a week later
 jaise hi jubilee line train apane antim padaav, stretford, par pahunchati he, logon kaa hujum east landan ke punah jeevant ho uthe maahaul main dub jane ke liye utawala ho baahar umad padataa he
 As you exit the station, you will find yourself in the new West Field Mall, where small groups of Olympic volunteers wearing flashing T-shirts and long plastic signs (named Lollipops) are ready to help you
 Will be seen; In addition, you will see signboards at the place which will guide you to the Queen Elizabeth Park, made of metal and steel, which is just ten minutes away, but this distance will be fixed in the rain or in the rays of the sun, it So only your luck will decide
 agar east and jane ke liye aap tub (metro train) kii bajaae bas lete hai to jaise hi tower brij se guzrenge, landan kii sari tadak-bhadak saadagi main tabdeel hone lagegi
 Instead of high-rise buildings, small buildings and houses will be seen and shops will start seeing glimpses of diverse racial groups
 yah vaaki kisi anya shahar-sa hi dikhataa he, lekin pichhali ek sadi se landan ke is bhaag main rahane vaale logon ne bina kisi pratirodh 'outcast' kaa label apana rakhaa he
 The dark lines of violence have been washed away, but the characters of poverty, oppression and mistrust are still complimented by the atmosphere which once used to be a pile of industrial waste
 landan ke is mul ann utpaadak kshetra ne audyogikaran kii raah pakad lee thi or lee nadi se lage lahalhate upjau kheton kii hariyaali se saji-sanwari jameen main kaarkaanon, rasinic sanyatron or mashinari kaa shor or dhuna bharne laga tha
 Thus began the journey of East London's relationship with a frenzy atmosphere
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan ise puri tarah se rond diya gaya tha, phir dashakon baad bhi kam laagat se bani jhenpadiyon main ateet kii parachhaaiyaan dolati hui najar aati hai
 a place that has been heavily satirized in the novels of George Orwell and Martin Amis
 yah kukhyat jaik da ripper ke nivas sthaan ke rup main sabase zyada janaa gaya-yah ek aisa myth ban gaya he jise paryaton ke nazariye se lokapriyata mili
 But for those whose home is here, all these dry and sarcastic things are harsh reality
 unke liye landan kaa matlab khulaa aasmaan or nimna aay varg ke makaan hai
 The East End has been steadfastly preparing for its role since 2005 when London won the Olympic Games bid to compete against Paris despite this siege past
 yahi ekmaatr disha thi jis ore yah shahar vikaas kar saktaa tha
 About 7 since then
 3 arab pound (lagbhag 72,789 karod ru
 ) Five areas — Newham, Tower Hamlet, Hackney, Greenwich and Waltham Forest — have been awarded for 'sustainable Gentrification'
 ek ore jahaan in saare prayaason (or nivesh) kaa makasad yahi he ki is jagah ko garimapurna rup diya jaae, vahiin kuch behad chintajanak maamle hai
 Irish, Jews, Bangladeshi and later East Europeans made the East End their refuge in the 1960s, as they had no better option
 yah jagah unhen landan main rahete hue bhi landan kii najaron se pare ek aashray de rahi thi jiske liye unhen koi badi keemat nahin chukaani pad rahi thi
 For them it is a wonderful experience to transform the swampy area of the algae-filled River Li into a city adorned with beautiful buildings, sparkling shops and a huge cultural club, behind a decade-long process
 unhone stretford ke pashchimi ilaake ke pradooshit or kam mulya vaale kheton ke 740 acre kshetra main viksit olympic stadium ko dekha he
 There have been more changes
 stretford stesan jo haal tak asurakshit mana jaataa tha, aaj desh-videsh se aane vaale lakhon logon ke liye 27 july se shuru hone vaale olympic khelon ko dekhne kaa pravesh dwaar banane vaala he
 It has also become the halt for the extremely high speed Eurostar line trains from London to Paris
 2
 The Olympic Park, spread over 5 sq km, will have around 28,000 new homes, most of which will later be converted into low cost useful housing for the locals
 is jagah par britain kaa sabase bada shahari park viksit kiya gaya he jisamen 3,00,000 jaleey paudhe, 2,000 ped or lee se laga paanch mile kaa kshetra pehle kii tarah khubasurat bana diya gaya he
 Peter Tudor, director of the London Legacy Development Corporation for Venues, says, "london's right to hold the Olympic Games has brought a message of development for this scarcity-stricken region
 ek viraasat ko sunishchit karne kii hamaari ranneeti main olympic park ke swaroop or nirmaan ko sabase zyada ahmiyat di gai thi
 “the swampy area has been transformed into an attractive greenery, by cleaning up about 2 million tonnes of polluted soil and making it useful again
 audyogic kachare se lo-carbon kancreet banaakar or bache hue gas pipon kaa istemaal kar 80,000 siton vaala stadium banaaya gaya he jo green construction kaa model mana ja rahaa he
 "we are considering what to do when the games are over," says Sir Allen Collins, managing director of the United Kingdom Trade and Investment
 '' aisi yojana he ki stadium ko footbal team ke upyog ke liye taiyaar kar diya jaae or yahaan ke nivasee yah aashaa kar sakate he ki jaaha hadeed kaa taiyaar kiya gaya equatic centre community pool ban jaae
 For the past seven years, while the focus was on construction, debris and the upcoming Olympic Games, the residents here were busy developing their own distinct subculture
 koi bhi us khaas parivartankaree din ke bare main nahin bataa saktaa jab ek anjaanaa-sa, bekaar sa east and apane bemaani chole se nikal kar amul badlaav ke saath jagamagaataa, pradipt rup lekar saamne khadaa ho gaya
 Today, its embellished look attracted celebrities like actor Ralph Fiennes and actress Kiara Knightley to such an extent that they have made their home here
 unke is ilaake main ghar banane se iskaa maan badha he
 From common music festivals to new-found multicultural chefs, slut galleries or borderless formats and art, the East End has emerged as an original and energetic form that has even faded London
 din ke dauraan jahaan log apni pasand kii chizon kii talash main butic stores main gum rahe hote hai, vahiin raat utarate hi mouj-masti karne waalon kaa samooh yahaan kii sadakon or galiyon ko nayaa party venue banaakar anand manaa rahaa hota he
 The Olympic Games will end in the coming few weeks, but the tone of the ascending tone of a new voice that the East End has found is going to resonate everywhere and with that the legacy of the infrastructure that is going to be famous

 jatisuchak shabd kaa istemaal karne ke maamle par shilpa shetty ne 23 disambar ko twitor par maafee maang lee
 An FIR was registered against Shilpa and Salman Khan on Saturday
 shilpa ne twit kiya- mere puraane intervyuu ke shabdon ko galat bhang se pesh kiya gaya
 Those words were not uttered to hurt anyone's feelings
 Some of my words from an interview in the past have been misinterpreted
 It was never said with the intent of hurting anyone's feelings
 
 
 — SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA (@theshilpashetty)december 23, 2017ek duusare twit main unhone likhaa- agar kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchi he to main maafee maangati hum
 i apologize if they have
 I’m proud to belong to a country that boasts of diverse castes and creeds and i respect each one of them
 🙏🙏 — SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA (@theshilpashetty) December 23, 2017 Republican activists are also opposing Salman's film Tiger Zinda Hai due to controversial comments
 rajasthan, upi or gujarat main bhi film ke virodh kii khabaren saamne aa chuki hai
 a vandalism incident also occurred during the film's show at Raj Cinemahal, Jaipur
 salmaan kaa virodh kathith taur par 5 saal puraane ek viral video kii vajah se ho rahaa he
 Salman Khan is using a generic term
 is shabd par valmiki samaaj ne kadi aapatti kii he
 The RPI threatened to protest Salman's comments, enhanced security
 Earlier on Friday, the National Commission for Schedule Tribe issued a notice in the entire matter and sought a reply from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Police Commissioners of delhi-mumbai in 7 days
 is bare main valmiki samaaj kaa kahana he ki publikali galat shabd kaa istemaal karne se hamaare samaaj kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchi he
 Let me tell you that Salman used the word casteist to tell his dance style on National TV during the promotion of his film 'ek Tha Tiger' five years ago
 jabaki shilpa ne media se baatcheet ke dauraan bayaan diya tha ki ve ghar main 'khaas tarah' se dressop hoti hai
 Sanjay Leela is not taking the name of the controversy over Bhansali's film 'padmavati'
 rajasthan main film padmavati ke virodh main ab rajput mahilaayein bhi baahar nikal ai hai
 Today in Jaipur, about 200 Rajput women took to the streets and performed
 ghumar par aapattiin rajput mahilaon nesanjay lila bhansaliko chetavanee di ki agar bina rajputon ko dikhaae film relies hui to khayr nahin he
 These Kshatrani women alleged that the way Rani Padmavati was shown dancing in the film, it was not right
 is film main rani padmavati kii bhoomika mendipika padukonan to rajputi dress main hai or na hi rajputi virangana kii tarah dikh rahi he
 Therefore, this film should be shown first to the Rajput society and only after that the film is released
 inkaa aarope he ki trailor main hi jo dikhaaya gaya he, wo sahi nahin dikh rahaa he
 They allege that women do not show arms and legs in Rajputi dress and queens did not dance in front of everyone
 mahilaon kaa netritv kar raheen rajput mahasabha kii manisha singh ne kaha ki film ko ham kisi bhi surat main maujuuda swaroop main relies nahin hone denge
 The former princess is also angry
 Meanwhile, many former royal families including Jaipur have also opened their front against this film
 jaipur kii purv rajkumaari diya kumari kaa kahana he ki ye hamaare liye bhaawanaaon kaa sawaal he
 Padmavati is like a goddess to us and we do not want to see her moving around
 inkaa aarope he ki sanjay lila bhansaali main film kii shooting kii shuruyaat main kaha tha ki film puri hone par samaaj ke logon ko dikhaaenge
 But he is withdrawing from his promise and adopting such tactics to promote the film
 bhansaali ke saport main film industriciyasi pachade main fancipadmavathike khilaaf kai bade rajaneta maidan main utar aae hai
 However, Sanjay Leela Bhansali has got strong support from the film industry
 somvaar ko film industry ke paanch sanghathanon ne baithak kar kaha ki sarkaar ko padmavati kii relies ke liye surakshit maahaul dena chahie
 On November 16, five entertainment organizations will protest against Bhansali's threats and protest against Padmavati, prohibiting the shooting for 15 minutes
 usase pehle deepika ne kai sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Already given a clarification, Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmini had a dispute about the dream sequence in the Padmavati, on which the clarification has come from the makers
 bhansaali ne haal hi main soshal media main ek baar phir kaha ki film main is tarah kaa koi sikvence nahin he
 The film is to be released on 1 December
 iske alaava chunaav acharsanhita ke kaaran saare vikaas ke kaam thap pad jate hai, lekin nitish ne kaha ki unke samarthan kaa yah matlab nahin lagaaya janaa chahie ki bihar main aane vaale loksabhaa ke saath chunaav karaae jaaenge
 Dismissing all speculation in this regard, he said that at present there is no such proposal
 isse purv party kii bihar ikai ke adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne is mudde par centre sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He felt that whatever amendment the central government would bring, the party would openly support it, but today Nitish also said that the issue should be debated throughout the country

 chaparasi banane kii chahat main aisi bheed umadi ki prashasan ke haath pair phool gaye
 In G-ESI Health Care Haryana, there was a rush of youth from across the state to recruit 70 Class IV posts at DC rate
 chaparasi pad ke liye yogyata aathvin paas thi par eme-bied-beatech degree dhari das hajaar se zyada yuva yahaan pahunch gaye
 But panicked after seeing the crowd, the administration postponed the recruitment
 yah haryana kaa haal he, jahaan soobe ke mukhyamantri ko padmavat par pabandi kii zyada chintaa he, alabatta rajya ke yuva kaise chaparasi banane tak ko utaavle hai, isaki koi parvaah nahin
 Because the question is not only about the crowd in Karnal
 jind kii court main chaparasi kii 9 post ke liye 15 hajaar aavedak intervyuu dene pahunch gaye the
 a few days ago, about 22 thousand applications were received for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University
 yani pet bharne ke liye naukari chahie or naukari chaparasi kii bhi mili to kisi ko koi gurej nahin kyonki naukari he nahin
 And only Haryana is bad - it is not so
 ek pakhwaade pehle rajasthan vidhansabha sachivalay main chaparasi kii job ke liye jin 12,453 logon kaa intervyuu liya gaya, unamem 129 ejeeniyar, 23 vakil, ek chartd accountint or 393 post graduate the
 To the extent that the job included the mla's son, that is, the mla's son is also ready to become a peon
 yaa kahen ki naukari he nahin to jugad ke aasare hi sahi vidhayak ke bete ko chaparasi kii naukari main gurej nahin
 In such a question, more than four and a half crores registered in the country are unemployed, and educated youth are eager to become a peon, then what is the employment policy of the government? Because the truth is that the government is not ready to believe that there is a job crisis in the country
 bijepi ke aalaa netaa kahin mudra yojana ke aasare desh main berogari ke sankat ko khaarij karte hai to pradhanmantri yah kehane se nahin hichakate ki berogari kii baaten bemaani hai, or ab dallalon ko rojgaar kaa sankat he
