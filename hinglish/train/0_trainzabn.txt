 Why did the issue of security of the country be raised in the press conference? loksabhaa chunaav ke aae rujhaanon ke anusaar dilli kii saaton loksabhaa siton par bijepi ko banpar vot milte dikhaai de rahe hai
 The important thing is that the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party are not able to beat the BJP even with the total votes
 isse saaf he yadi dilli main congress or ‘aap’ kaa gathbandhan bhi ho jaataa, to bhi bijepi ko haraa paanaa naammumkin tha
 It is clear from the votes BJP got that the people of Delhi would not like it at all if they had an alliance between the two parties
 chunaav ayog kii website par 1 bajkar 50 minute par maujuud aankadon kii maane to bijepi ko 56
 The Congress got 22%, while the Congress got 3% votes

 Now the question arises that despite all the efforts of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and celebrity faces, the performance of 'AAP' was very poor? By 11 am, 'AAP' in only 2 seats out of 7 Lok Sabha seats in Delhi was second
 Stayed on north-west dilli se ‘aap’ pratyaashee gugan singh or south dilli se raghav chaddha duusare number par rahe
 Apart from this, Pankaj Gupta from Chandni Chowk, Atishi from East Delhi, Brijesh Goyal from New Delhi, Dilip Pandey from north-east Delhi and Balbir Jakhar from West Delhi were third

 Both of them were in the fight of second number
 chunaav jeetne ke liye ‘aap’ netaaon ne kaaphi badi ranneeti banaai thi
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal campaigned fiercely in every assembly of all Lok Sabha constituencies
 soshal media se lekar jameen tak khub prachaar hua
 Now the question arises that people have rejected the issue of full state
 However, this was already realized by the AAP leadership, which is why in the last days of the campaign, attempting to surround the central government by diverting attention from the issue of full statehood
 dilli main prachaar hua ki centre sarkaar kaam nahin karne de rahi
 Despite this, the people of Delhi did not trust AAP much
 party kaa koi ummidavaar badhat banaate nahin dikhaai diya
 aap's alliance strategy with Congress failed! Arvind Kejriwal made all efforts to have an alliance with Congress before the election
 kai maukon par unhone congress ke varisht netaaon se sampark kiya
 Rahul Gandhi too agreed on a 4-3 formula but, AAP leaders rejected it
 raajnneetik jaankaron kii maane to ‘aap’ kaa congress ke gathbandhan karne kii kavayad janata ko raas nahin ai
 Through voting, people have responded to both the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress

 It would be nice to see journalists reporting on the news channels from the ashram of Sant Rampal, but the situation is not so easy
 hisar se lekar barwaala tak police ke kai checkpost hai

 har din ham subah 4-5 baje ke bich uthte hai
 Reaching the last checkpost showing their I-card
 iske baad na to koi khud ja saktaa he or na hi koi gaadi ja sakati he
 After fighting with the police, we leave in front of the barricade
 ek baar andar gaye to puure din ke liye andar, kyonki dobaaraa police andar jane nahin detii
 We and our companions walk the road ahead carrying our shoot items in big bags
 andar na to khaane ke liye kuch he or na hi pine ke liye kuch he, kyonki ham log subah nikalate hai isliye khaanaa bhi nahin miltaa he
 Whatever we take with us a little bit of biscuits and namkeen, it works for the whole day
 yaa phir kisi ko bich main kahin se bhi kuch khaanaa laane kaa mauka mil gaya to sabhi patrkaar mil-julkar khate hai
 Although Baba's ashram tries to give tea and biscuits again and again, but no journalist drinks the tea here, because they know that after bathing Baba with milk, the same milk makes tea here
 isliye sabko lagata he ki baba ke log jo pani pilaa rahe hai, kahin uski bhi yahi kahani na ho
 Throughout the day, there are noises with the people of Baba Rampal
 ve chaahate hai ki ham khabar ko unke hisaab se chalaaen, hamen bhi hajaaron logon kii ugr bheed ke saath sanyam se reporting kerani padati he
 Many times Baba's people threaten journalists for news
 yahaan ke halaat dekhakar itnaa hi kahuunga ki baba ke log commando suicide bombar kii tarah hai, jo itane kade halaat main bhi marane maarane ko taiyaar hai
 The ashram's electricity and water are cut off, so many people have not bathed for many days
 paas khadey hone par iskaa ehsaas apane aap ho jaataa he
 Some call Baba Rampal a joke on Rumpal, and some call Barwala a Baghdadi
 majaak ke bich achaanak police ection main aati he to ham bhi apana kaam shuru kar dete hai
 Many times the mob chases the police, so we run towards the fields, because the danger here is more than the lathis of the police, people of Baba Rampal, who are ready with weapons
 hamaare paas phone yaa camere kii bydaree charge karne ke simit sansaadhan hote hai or usee main hamen samay der raat tak gujaarna hota he
 Most of the locals here are against Baba, but the police do not even let him wander close
 reporting ke baad ham der raat apane hotel kii ore badhate hai or subah-subah phir nikal padate hai, is anokhe baba ke ashram kii ore

 One day the saint was taking a morning walk with one of his followers
 achaanak ek vyakti unke nikat aayaa or unhen bhala-bura kehane laga
 The saint smiled
 sant par koi asar na dekh vah vyakti pareshaan ho gaya
 He got angry and started abusing his ancestors
 phir bhi sant muskaraate rahe
 When there was no effect on the saint, the person dismounted and went out of the way
 us vyakti ke jate hi ek anuyaayi ne sant se poocha ki aapane us dusht kii baton kaa koi jawaab kyon nahin diya, vah bolta rahaa or aap muskaraate rahe
 Did you not bother at all with his words? The saint said nothing and pointed to his follower
 kuch der baad sant ke saath vah anuyaayi kaksh main pahunchaa
 The saint said, 'you stop here, i come from inside now
 kuch der baad sant apane kamare se nikle to unke haathon main kuch maile kapade the
 He came out and said to that follower, "here you are, take off your clothes and wear them
" ’jaaniye koun hai lingayat, kyon hindu dharm se hona chaahate hai alag?anuyaayi ne dekha ki un kapadon main badi tej durgandh he, usase ajeeb si badboo aa rahi thi
 The follower threw those clothes away as soon as he took those clothes in his hand
 sant bole, ‘ab samajhe? jab koi tumse bina matlab ke bhala-bura kahata he to
 You get angry and wear his abusive words, but cannot wear other's dirty clothes
 jis tarah tum apane saaf suthere kapadon kii jagah ye maile kapade dhaaran nahin kar sakate, usee tarah maine bhi us aadmi ke phenke hue apshabdon ko dhaaran nahin kiya
 This was the reason why i did not mind his words

 karnataka kader ke iees afasar mohammad mohsin ne pradhanmantri modi kaa helicopter check kar liya
 Due to this sudden checking, the Prime Minister was delayed by 15 minutes
 chunaav ayog ne mohammad mohsin ko nilambit kar diya or kaha ki special protection group kii suraksha ghere main rahane vaale logon kii jaanch kii prakriya ke anusaar unhone kaam nahin kiya
 Mohammad Mohsin is a 1996 batch officer
 is aadesh main likhaa he ki mohammad mohsin ne espisi ke sambandh main chunaav ayog ke 22 march 2019 or 10 april 2014 ke aadesh ke anuroop kaary nahin kiya he
 The Election Commission suspends this officer, citing various rules
 ham aapako bataa den ki espiji suraksha sirf pradhanmantri, rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or priyanka gandhi ko he

 It consists of about 13 people
 grahamantri rajnath singh hai, chandrababu naidu, prafull kumaar mahant, yogi adityanath, akhilesh yadav, mulaayam singh yadav, adwani or mayawati
 When our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar asked the Commission on what basis the IAS officer was suspended due to the Prime Minister's helicopter check, the Commission cited the order of April 10, 2014 that the security guards of the SPG would not be checked
 hamaare sahyogi arvind gunashekhar kaa kahana he ki 10 april 2014 ke aadesh ko dhyaan se padhaa he
 In the order dated 10 April 2014 it is written that the use of government vehicles is completely banned in any campaign or election related work
 magar pradhanmantri va anya raajnneetik shakhsiyaton ko chhot he ki ve sarkari vaahanon kaa istamaal kar sakate hai
 Because they are at risk from terrorist and extremist activities and require high level of protection
 jinaki suraksha sansad yaa vidhansabha ke banaae sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon se hoti he
 So it becomes clear that the order of April 10, 2014 does not say that the official helicopter of the person under SPG security cover cannot be searched
 arvind kaa kahana he ki chunaav ayog ne jin niyamon kaa hawala kiya he, unka kagaz par vajood hi nahin he
 So has Mohammad Mohsin been punished for doing his duty, is it because he has searched the Prime Minister's helicopter
 samasya ye he ki ab patrkaar detail nahin padhate
 Forget in Hindi newspapers, something will be printed
 channel kaa haal to aap jaanate hai
 Arvind Gunasekhar has read the order letters which have been given by the Election Commission
 or jab padhaa he to pataa chalaa he ki kahin nahin likhaa he ki espiji suraksha hone ke naate pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii talaashi nahin hogi
 Now i want to read another part of the order of 10 April 2014
 aap ise dhyaan se padhie
 It has written that if ever there is any doubt that the authority under the SPG Act or other special provisions has increased the security assessment in such a way that the electoral interests in favor of any party or candidate from those vehicles are If affected, the Commission will bring the matter to the notice of the Government concerned so that appropriate steps can be taken
 sambidhit sarkaar kaa matlab hua ki kai baar mukhyamantri bhi espiji suraksha ghere main ho sakate hai to rajya sarkaar ko likhaa jayega ki unki samiksha yaa moolyankan karnaa he ki espiji vaahan sahi main zaruri he yaa nahin
 In this case, the Ministry of Home Affairs could be written
 hamane chunaav ayog ke aadesh kaa hindi main shabdash: anuwaad nahin kiya he
 You have also done some expressions somewhere
 yah sari mehnat hamaare sahyogi arvind gunashekhar kii he, jise main pesh kar rahaa hum
 Arvind does not know Hindi and i do not know English
 magar baat jo sahi hoti he wo bhashaa ke naam par ruk nahin paati
 Arvind has said that there is an order of 14 July 1999 by the Election Commission
 isamen likhaa he ki talaashi se kisi bhi sarkari vimaan yaa helicopter ko chhot nahin di gai he
 So has the Election Commission suspended Mohammad Mohsin with the help of a provision which is not a provision at all
 arvind bataa rahe hai ki chunaav ayog jis 10 april 2014 ke aadesh kaa hawala de rahaa he usamen likhaa hi nahin he ki espiji suraksha praapt vyakti ke helicopter kii jaanch nahin hogi
 Arvind said that Election Commission officials have also searched the Gandhi family chopper
 ye ahamed patel ne twit kiya he
 Sources in the Election Commission said that Manmohan Singh has also been searched as Prime Minister
 ab ek sawaal or he
 The Election Commission has done this action on whose complaint
 chunaav ayog ne jo nilamban kiya he uske aadesh main shikaayat karta kaa zikr nahin he
 It is also not written that the Chief Electoral Officer of Odisha, Chief Electoral Officer has sent the complaint, sent the report
 to kya chunaav ayog ne khud se karrwai kar di, apane aadesh kii public copy main yah sab kyon nahin he
 The Election Commission has cited the order dated 22 March 2019, but it is also written in this regard regarding checking at the kick-off airport
 chunavi prakriya ke dauraan vyakti or saamaan kii jaanch or talaashi se sambandhit jitne bhi niyam or prakriyaayein hai unka sakhti se paalan hona chahie
 No one should be exempted from this
 jinhen chhot mili he unhen chhod kar sabhi yatriyon or unke saamaanon kii vimaan main chadhate vakt yaa airport main pravesh karne se pehle jaanch hogi
 Nowhere in this order is written that the person acquiring SPG protection is exempt
 ek or baat 22 march 2019 kaa aadesh commercial airport se sambandhit he
 Sambalpur does not have a commercial airport
 mohammad mohsin ne raily sthal par talaashi lee thi
 So has Mohammad Mohsin got his duty
 vaise mohsin ne saahasik kadam uthaaya or chunaav ke dauraan vyavastha main bharosa badhaane vaala kadam uthaaya he
 At a time when bureaucracy is identified as weak and timid, such steps become a source of self-confidence and moral strength to those sitting in the bureaucracy for a long time
 chunaav ayog kii press conference main yah sawaal uthaa ki ayog ko kisne shikaayat kii to ayog ne kaha ki field afasar or odisha ke mukhya chunaav kaaryakari se soochna mili thi
 The Election Commission has suspended, but now an officer is being sent to the spot for investigation
 kya pehle nahin bheja janaa chahie tha tab ection liya jaataa
 You will remember that in his election speech in Latur, Maharashtra, Prime Minister Modi had said that the voters going to vote for the first time cannot dedicate their vote to the martyrs of Pulwama and the brave soldiers involved in the Airstrike
 abhi tak pradhanmantri ke bayaan par koi faisla nahin aayaa he
 The Election Commission should explain why there is a delay, is it time to ask this question in the same manner in taking action in the matter of the Prime Minister, that is prompt and fair
 aaj jab ayog ke press conference main yah poocha gaya tha ki latur vaale bayaan par kya karrwai kii gai to aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 The Commission replied that initially a paragraph of his speech had arrived
 ab pramanit bhaashan kii kapi aa gai he or jaanch ho rahi he
 This is the reply of the Election Commission
 9 april ko pradhanmantri ne latur main bhaashan diya tha
 It is 18 April
 9 din main ayog karrwai nahin kar paaya he
 When the reporters asked where is the order in which it is written that SPG will not search for the Prime Minister's Helicopter, then the answer was that we will check and tell you
 rajyapal kalyaan singh ke bare main raashtrapati ko sifarish kii gai thi ki ve karrwai karen, abhi tak koi soochna nahin he
 All these questions are being disappeared from Hindi newspapers so that the public remains in the dark

 Constitution expert Dr
 subhash kaashyap ne kaha, ‘yadi raashtrapati chunaav kaa aadhaar saal 1971 se badalakar 2011 kar diya jaae, to bich ke in 40 saalon ke dauraan badi aabaadi ko dekhte huye kai rajyon ke vidhayakon ke maton kaa mulya or kul maton main unki hissedari bad jaaegi
 According to Kashyap, in the presidential elections held on the basis of 1971 population, such states will not get proper representation, whose population has grown rapidly during these 40 years

 The basis of the 1952 presidential election was the 1951 population, while the 1962 election was also held on the basis of the 1951 population due to the timely census data of 1961
 iske baad 70 ke dashak main huye raashtrapati chunaav kaa aadhaar 1971 kii janaganana bani
 ' unhone bataaya ki iske baad 1971 kii janaganana ko aadhaar banaakar hi loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke nirvachan kshetron kaa parisemen kiya gaya or varsh 2004 tak ke sabhi aam evam vidhansabha chunaav usee parisemen ke aadhaar par karaae gaye
 During this period, presidential elections were also held according to the 1971 census
 haalanki samvidhan main jansankhya ke sabase naye aankadon ke hisaab se raashtrapati chunaav karaane kaa praavdhaan tha, lekin parisemen kaa aadhaar purana hone ke kaaran raashtrapati chunaav bhi puraani jansankhya ke aankadon ke hisaab se hote rahe
 It is noteworthy that after this, in 2002, the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Bajpai at the Center amended the constitution and decided that all the presidential elections till 2026 will be held according to the 1971 census
 aisa isaliye kiya gaya kyonki dakshin ke rajyon ne jansankhya niyantran ke kaaryakramon ko behatar tareeke se lagu kiya tha, isaliye uskaa puraskaar unhen is prakaar se diya gaya ki 2026 tak ke raashtrapati chunaav main aise rajyon kaa anupatik pratinidhitiv kam nahin ho

 The current delimitation of constituencies is based on the 2001 census data under the provisions of the Delimitation Act 2002
 saal 2002 main bharat ke samvidhan main vishesh rup se sanshodhan kiya gaya tha ki 2026 ke uparaant hone vaali pratham janaganana tak nirvachan kshetron kaa parisemen nahin kiya jayega
 Thus, the existing constituencies based on the 2001 census data will remain unchanged till the first census to be held after 2026
 ’ Subhash Kashyap said, 'the constitutional amendment in 2001 has been extended till 1971, the base year for the presidential election till 2026
 ab yadi nae parisemen kaa aadhaar varsh 2001 kii janaganana ko raashtrapati chunaav kaa aadhaar bananaa he, to iske liye samvidhan main ek baar phir se sanshodhan karnaa padegaa’ According to Virag Gupta, a lawyer and legal expert in the Supreme Court, "according to the constitution, there was a clear provision for the determination of the votes of the people's representatives for the presidential election, that the presidential election will be based on the latest census
 1952 ke raashtrapati chunaav kaa aadhaar 1951 kii jansankhya thi, jabaki 1961 kii janaganana ke aankade samay par nahin mil paane ke kaaran 1962 kaa chunaav bhi 1951 kii jansankhya ke aadhaar par karaae gaye
 After this, the 1971 census became the basis of the presidential elections held in the 70s
 ’ He said that after this, the constituencies of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha constituencies were delimited on the basis of 1971 census and till 2004 all general and assembly elections were held on the same limit
 is dauraan raashtrapati chunaav bhi 1971 kii janaganana ke anusaar hi hote rahe
 Although there was a provision in the constitution to hold presidential elections according to the latest figures of population, due to the old basis of delimitation, presidential elections were also held according to the old population figures
 ullekhneey he ki iske baad 2002 main kendra kii atal bihari bajpeyi ke netritv vaali rajg sarkaar ne samvidhan main sanshodhan karke yah tay kar diya ki 2026 tak ke sabhi raashtrapati chunaav 1971 kii janaganana ke anusaar hi honge
 This was done because the states of the south had better implemented population control programs, so they were rewarded in such a way that the proportional representation of such states is not reduced in the 2026 presidential elections
 tippaniyan According to the Election Commission 'according to Article 82 of the Constitution, after every census the Parliament enacts the Delimitation Act by law

 Due to the ever increasing pollution in delhi-ncr, Abdillihaf Marathon is also under threat
 pradooshan ke kaaran kaiathliteis baar marathon se hatane kaa man bana rahe hai
 Every year, due to pollution in Delhi, dark black smog makes Delhiites live
 or is saal to abhi sardiya shuru hone main kaaphi samay he par abhi se hi dilli kii aabhohawaa bad se badtar hoti ja rahi he
 The situation is expected to get worse in the coming days
 aise main 21 oktober ko hone vaale airtelhaf marathonamen bhaag lene vaale athleton ke swasthya ko lekar gambhir sawaal uthne lage hai
 Taking concrete steps, Dr
 Trehan, the head of Sarkar Medanta The Medicity, also believes that in such a situation many problems may arise for people going to the city or running in the morning
 unka kahana he kyonki yah samasya pichley 2 saalon se or gambhir hoti dikh rahi he tosarkaarko thos kadam uthaane chahie the jisamen vah naakaam rahi he
 He further said that many kinds of serious diseases are troubling people due to pollution, especially in this season the number of patients with respiratory problems in hospitals is increasing
 marathon kii taarikh sahidilli ke jasola ke rahane vaale anik pichley kai saalon se dilli kii half marathon main hissaa le rahe hai, lekin is saal 29 oktober ko hone vaali half marathon main hissaa nahin lenge
 However, he believes that the date fixed for the marathon this time is perfect in view of the increasing pollution because the kind of pollution that comes to Delhi when crops are burning from the surrounding states in the months of November and December is When will it be in the month of October, along with this, Diwali firecrackers and Delhi's own pollution increases manifold in the month of november-december, given that this date will be right 
 haalanki unka yah bhi kahana he ki is mausam main unke jaise health freeq bhi subah kii saiyr or kasarat chhod dete hai or ghar main hi eksrasij karte hai
 Like Anik, Tarun Wadhwa of Noida also stops morning walks and exercise for a few months in winter due to increasing pollution
 tarun peshey se ek adventure sports kii company chalaate hai or apni sehat par vishesh dhyaan dete hai
 Preparations due to pollution are incomplete
 He likes to book many types of adventure including cycle races and half marathons but this time he will not participate in this race because he believes that his preparations have not been completed due to increasing pollution
 half marathon ke liye jis tareeke kii kasarat chahie uske liye subah shaam khuli hawa main eksrasij karnaa behad aavashyak he jo vah abhi nahin kar paa rahe hai or unka kahana he ki sarkaar ko jald se jald is masale par koi thos kadam uthaane chahie
 Many times environmentalist Vimal Indu has been raising the serious problem of increasing pollution in Delhi
 unka kahana he ki is samasya ke purna nistaaran ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se jald hi thos kadam kii jarurat he
 The manner in which crops are burnt in the surrounding states and the growing problem of trains running on the roads in Delhi, every day there are many growing factories in Delhi NCR and there are many problems on which the government should take concrete steps to make any concrete results
 Can go badhate pradooshan ne half marathon main hissaa lene vaale logon ke liye fasalon ne kaaphi chot pahunchaai he
 People do not leave homes out of fear unless absolutely necessary
 agar halaat aise hi rahe to aane vaale samay main marathon main daudane vaale log naa ke baraabar honge
 Overall, the winters will disturb people a lot this time in Delhi too
 oktober ke maheene main hi jis tareeke se dilli ensiaar menvaatavarandooshit hota najar aa rahaa he usase dar yahi he ki november or disambar kaa maheenaa logon par kaaphi baari padegaa or khaastaur par saans se judi samasyaon ke marijon ke liye dilli kaaphi khatarnaak sabit hogi

 However, the article also notes that CPEC has long been seen as a symbol of china-pakistan economic cooperation

 The artists of 'fifty Shades of Darker' have been told not to use excessive profanity in social media and interviews
 yah film isi maheene relies ho rahi he
 According to a report by dailymail

 Harden said, 'ultimately it's a love story

 The story is old
 ek medical college main anatomi ke professor ne chaatro se pechida sawaal poochhaah maanav sharir kaa koun-sa ang uttejnaa main apane aakaar se kai guna bad saktaa he? puri kaksha dam sadhakar intjaar karne lagi
 Then the professor asked a student to answer
 chaatra kaa cheharaa shame se laal ho gaya
 He refused to answer and said that it was not legitimate to ask for his answer
 professor muskaraayaa or usne chaatra se teen baaten kahin: usne unke nots nahin padhe hai, uske dimag main gandagi bhari he, or jab vah shaadi karegi tab use shaayad maayusi jhelni pade

 He is not a critic of the BJP in any way
 unhone twitor par bas itnaa kaha, khoda pahaad or nikali chuhia
 Handing this 'chuhia' in a sealed envelope to the extremely angry Supreme Court, the NDA government, its legal officers and spokespersons, all made themselves laughs

 Indeed, as noted economist Ashok Desai pointed out in this week's 'the View', the most preferred option for Indians to keep black money is no longer an account in Swiss or any foreign bank
 ab yah real estate he, aprapt puunjigat laabh hai, cricket se lekar chunaav tak or jins se lekar mausam tak har kalpaneey cheez main sakriy satta bazaar hai, bank kii tijoriyaan hai, or bistar yaa gaddon ke neeche kii sabase pasandida jagahen hai
 The government itself has admitted that many of these accounts can be legal

 The honorable Supreme Court also seems to have accepted this principle

 So, why is our hand so tight in terms of a basic infrastructure? The reason is simple
 jab sieji ne 2ji spectrum main anumaanit nuksaan ke 57,000 karod ru

 Even if different figures were revealed, everyone from Modi to the media immediately accepted the maximum amount

 Now just think, could there be such a high price for so many spectrums? Could India's telecom sector provide that kind of money for it? And if you could, why did you not easily eliminate the defense budget and ask the army to auction a little bit of the spectrum stored with them every year and buy the guns, warships and jet aircraft they need? The growth of India's telecom sector was held hostage to those fantasies and the BJP government will have to face months of embarrassment in trying to get off the back of that lion, even more when the opposition is angry at every new auction Will express koyala bhi itnaa hi nishthur udaarahan he
 Of course, there were scams in the allocation of coal mines under the UPA rule, just as they were in 2G spectrum, the Commonwealth Games and other cases
 lekin kya harek aavanton main jaalsaji kii gai? kya nuksaan utane lakhon karodon main tha jo sieji ne apane kuch deele ravaie ke chalate gadhe or bataae the? kyonki endie, khaskar bijepi, ne uchhalkar adhiktam dhanrashi ke aankade ko hathohath liya tha
 As a result, when the matter was in the Supreme Court, as the government, he had little scope to do anything on 'colgate'
 1993 ke baad ke sabhi aavanton radd kar die gaye or vah laachaar dekhati rahi
 This was the first major crisis of the government, the effect of which can be seen on almost every sector from mining to energy, metals, cement and fertilizers, banking

 Social media users from the neighboring country are once again sharing old fake videos in which Prime Minister Modi was described as the mastermind for the Pulwama attack on 14 February
 pakistan ke utyub yujar doctor turki kaa ek video ek baar phir soshal media par dikh rahaa he jisamen daawa kiya gaya he ki usne pulavama ke baad pradhanmantri modi kii kol recording he
 This video is about 5 months old
 india today anti phek news war room ne paaya ki daawa jhootha or bebuniyaad he
 The truth behind the claim This video, posted on March 3, has been shared over 39000 times so far
 is video kaarkiveop yahaan dekh sakate hai
 Pakistani You Tube user presented an old fake video of a Facebook user Avi Dandia as evidence
 kai india today samet kai factchekars ne is kahani ko farji sabit kiya tha
 The voice that Avi Dandiya used in his video was fake
 video main kya hadoctor turki ke 11 minute lambey video main wo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf jehar ugal rahaa he
 It claims that an audio of PM Modi has been leaked which proves that Prime Minister Modi was behind the Pulwama attack
 iske baad wo fasebuk par farji khabar failaane vaale avi dandiya kaa video chalaata he or logon se usase sunne kii apil karata he
 That voice is between a woman and two union ministers
 isko sunne se lagata he ki inkaa iraadaa bhartiya fouj par hamalaa kar deshbhakti kii bhaavana bhadakaana he
 After this, Pakistani youtube users play a fake picture of Indian media and call it the mastermind of Pulwama
 wo pakistani ke kabje main rahe wing commander abhinandan kaa video bhi chalaata he or bhartiya logon se pradhanmantri modi ko satta se hataane kii apil karata harrantha ne kiya tha farjivade kaa khulaasa1 march 2019 ko avi dandiya ne fasebuk par ek video post kiya tha jisamen daawa kiya tha ki bijepi ke do mantriyon ne ek mahila se baat kii thi
 Later this claim proved to be fake, fact checkers like Alt News and India Today had proved it wrong
 is baatcheet ko tatkaaleen grahamantri rajnath singh or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke kai intervyuu ko jodakar taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 youtuber of Pakistan took some part of the fake video of Dandiya and claimed that it is the voice of Prime Minister Modi
 dandiya kaa daawa he ki wo ek NRI he aurfesbukapar uske 2
 There are 8 lakh followers
 doctor turki koun hepakistan ke utyub yujar ‘doctor Turki’ keutubeoractchebookper baari sankhya main phans hai
 He runs youtube channel since 2017 and is followed by nearly 5 lakh people
 ye channel wo saudi arab se chalaata he or uske zyaadaatar video modi virdohi or bharat virdohi hote hai
 conclusiondoktor Turkey's claim is misleading and has used another fake video to substantiate his claim
 haalanki usne ek baat sahi kahi he jab bhartiya media ne ek videshi sainik kii tasviir ko pulavama kaa mastermind bataa diya tha
 Many media institutions used this photo at that time but later it was corrected

 kya yah aaj bhi sach he?sansad kii lok lekha samiti ne mujhe gavaahi ke liye bulaayaa hi nahin
 If they really wanted to know the truth, they should have called me first, because i had taken the initiative of open bidding
 maine media ko kuch nahin bataaya kyonki main apane sansmaran likh rahaa hum
 It will take three or four months more
 main isamen puraa kissa bayaan kar duungaa
 Surely you can tell me something else? The Prime Minister was definitely in favor of starting the bid system
 meraa andaja he ki shaayad unhen party kaa samarthan nahin tha
 In July 2004, you took the bid file to the Prime Minister's Office

 Nair returned it after raising some technical questions
 kya naukarshahon ne paardarshee niyaman pranali kii sthapana main rukaawat daali?prakriya kii shuruyaat 28 june, 2004 ko sabhi sambhddha pakshon kii baithak se hui
 i put forward my view that the bidding process for coal block allocation is a better method
 udyog jagat main bhi mujhe zyada samarthak nahin mili
 i think people thought why pay when they can get free? i thought it would be difficult to make a fair selection when the number of applicants would increase a lot
 isliye maine spardhaatmak boli kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya or pradhanmantri ke saamne rakhaa
 i discussed this with him during my first briefing about the ministry
 ve mujhase sahamat the
 i started work by bringing some amendments to the Coal Mines Nationalization Act 1973
 meraa akalan yah tha ki 2004 ke ant tak yah pranali sthapit ho jaani chahie
 So i stopped the inquiry committee
 phir shibu sorain dobaaraa koyala mantri ban gaye or cabinet note rakhaa gaya
 He said that it is not needed at this time and decided to continue the system at that time
 spardhaatmak boli prakriya thande baste main chali gai
 After Soren's resignation, when the coal ministry again came into the hands of the Prime Minister, it was decided that work on the bidding process could be started
 maine cabinet note pesh kiya, jisamen koyala khan rashtriyakaran adhinium main kuch sanshodhan karne kaa suzav tha
 The Law Department suggested the inclusion of a small amendment that coal block allocation would be done through competitive bidding
 sambhddha niyam banane ke liye ek or sanshodhan kii baat kahi gai
 But the Prime Minister's Office thought that we do not need to bring an ordinance for priority, but should take the approval of Parliament
 vah pehali baadha thi
 This showed that the competitive bidding process could not start any time soon
 uske baad koyala rajya mantri dasri narayan raav ne kaha ki rajya sarkarein nai prakriya ke viruddh hai

 nair ne rajyon ke mukhya sachivon ke saath baithak kii
 States were to provide information limited to verifying the details of the applicants, which is useful in decision making
 lekin pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa kahana tha ki rajyon ko aavanton prakriya par aapatti thi or yah baat cabinet note main shaamil kii gai jise baad main desari narayan raav ne mere ritair hone tak thande baste main daal diya
 i then came to know that he returned the Cabinet note with the comment that the current process of allocation could continue
 uske baad prastaav kiya gaya ki yah prakriya sirf koyale tak simit na rahe, balki khan evam khanij vikaas niyaman adhinium 1957 se sanchalit anya khanijon par bhi lagu kii jaae
 In this way the proposal of the bidding process was buried
 aapane disambar, 2005 main ritair hone se pehle jab pradhanmantri karyaalay ko raji karne kii duusari koshish kii to kya hua?shibu sorain ke duusari baar koyala mantri banane par unhone kuch jaruri filein roak leen
 i went to him and told him that i think the files are being deliberately blocked

 The matter was taken up to the Prime Minister through Nair
 nair ne kuch din baad ek kaarykram main mulaakaat ke dauraan mujhe yah baat bataai
 But two weeks later, Soren said that he disagreed with me, so the offer should be dropped
 uske baad filein narayan raav ke paas gai
 Now the FIR is accused of conspiracy in your name, so how will you respond to the Prime Minister? What is your defense? Talabira-2 is a captive block, for which Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) and Hindalco were the two trusted applicants
 donon pakshon ke paas acchhee vittiya takat or takneekee maharath baraabar thim
 Initially there was a slight inclination towards NLC, a company of my own ministry
 jaanch samiti ne uske paksh main faisla liya or maine samarthan kiya
 Before issuing the order Kumar Mangalam Birla made his stand and asked me how his company's claim was inferior to NLC
 unhone bataaya ki unka daawa enelsi se kuch behatar tha, kyonki unki company pehali aavedak thi
 They said that they are not disputing the allocation to NLC but why fired us? He also stated that NLC, being a PSU, can get coal blocks anywhere, whereas the private company has the right to apply only for notified blocks
 mujhe laga ki unki baat main dam he
 The Prime Minister's Office also sent a proposal to reconsider him
 mujhe unki baat main tark najar aayaa
 i proposed to NLC and Hindalco to have a joint venture
 pradhanmantri ne use manjuuri de di
 Rethinking a decision does not mean conspiring with Kumar Mangalam Birla
 main ek nishpaksh faisle kii puri jimmedaari letaa hum
 This was approved by the Prime Minister as the Minister of Coal
 mujhe isamen koi galati najar nahin aati
 If this is a conspiracy, then there were three persons in it - Kumar Mangalam Birla, i am the daughter of the Secretary of Coal and the Prime Minister as the Minister of Coal at that time
 ek nishpaksh or tarksangat faisle ko sajeesh bataakar sibiai pradhanmantri ko birla or mere saath sajeesh karne vaale ke rup main kathghare main khadaa kar rahi he
 Do you think the scapegoat is being searched? i do not understand what the Congress will get by doing all this with me
 mujhe to bas yahi lagata he ki ve anaavashyak rup se pradhanmantri ko kathghare main khadaa kar rahe hai
 If it is a conspiracy then they will be considered involved in this conspiracy
 yah baat tark se pare he
 Senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam has urged the Chief Justice to withdraw his candidature as a Supreme Court judge

 Subrahmanyam's office said, in the present circumstances, he does not think his name should be reconsidered as a Supreme Court judge
 isliye unhone supreme court ke nyaayadhish ke taur par apni ummidavaari waapas lene ke liye mukhya nyaayadhish ko chitthee likhi he

 The Congress is yet to come out of the vortex in which its kayak was submerged
 loksabhaa chunaav main jabardast paraajay ke baad party ne sattarudh dal par aarope lagane ke alaava aisa koi kaam nahin kiya he jisase lage ki vah phir se apane ko sthapit karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 There is neither a buzz of restructuring in the party nor an attempt to reinvigorate it
 or is kaaran hi ab do rajyon main khuli baghawat dekhne main aa rahi he
 Himanta Vishwa Sarma, a senior minister in the northeastern state of Assam, has played the bugle of rebellion and resigned from his post
 unka kahana he ki mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ko fouran hataa diya jaae kyonki ve asafal ho chuke hai
 He reminded CM Gogoi that he had offered to resign after the election defeat and he should resign
 itnaa hi nahin sarama ne party main aantarik loktantr kii kami kii bhi baat uthaai
 Similarly, Maharashtra Minister Narayan Rane has resigned from the cabinet, seeking the resignation of his Chief Minister
 unke bhi samarthak chaahate hai ki siem prithviraj chavaan ko hataakar unhen yah pad diya jaae
 Only last week, he had expressed his intentions to the high command and now resigned
 darasal rane ko ummid thi ki alaakaman chavaan ko hataakar unhen siem kii kursi de saktaa he lekin aisa kuch hota nahin dikhaa to unhone yah pintara apanaaya he
 Anyway, after the plight of congress-ncp alliance in Maharashtra, there is a situation of fear in the party
 gathbandhan ke netaa surakshit raste talash rahe hai or mukhyamantri ko bali kaa bakra bananaa chaahate hai jabaki is paraajay main sabhi baraabar ke bhagidaar hai
 But the party high command is silent and watching the spectacle
 samajha jaataa he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne assam ke siem ko badalane kii maang to khaarij kar di he lekin rajya ikai main hui baghaavat ko thaamne ke bare main vah chup hai
 It does not seem that he is thinking anything about Maharashtra
 sonia gandhi ke puraane salaahkaar bhi chuppi saadhe baithe hai
 This means that the party has neither an immediate plan nor any long-term strategy
 maharashtra main to chunaav aane hi vaale hai or vahaan party kii durgati he
 In such a situation, to save its existence, it is necessary that the party works under a concrete plan
 lekin aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 The party is silent and has neither politicians nor activists to stop the Modi wave
 aisa lagata he ki party ab paraajay kii maansikta se baahar nahin nikal paa rahi he
 It seems that this party which is more than one and a half hundred years old now has neither the vision nor any concrete plan
 zaahir he aane vaala samay uske liye or kshtdaayi hoga

 Recently, Nepal's Central Investigation Agency CIB with 36 doctors from 10 districts working in the Terai area of nepal did something similar
 unhen unke kaarysthal masalan sarkari aspataal, nijee aspataal or clinicon se pakadakar police vine main aise thunsa gaya goyaa ye koi bade apradhi yaa aatanki hon
 The extent is that half a dozen women doctors were treated the same way
 doctoron ne is giraftaar kaa virodh karte hue sarkaar kii bhedbhaavpurn niti kii kadi aalochana kii he
 Anjani Kumar Jha, president of the Nepal Medical Association (NMA), said, "there should be action against the wrongdoers, but not in the" terrorist style "
 " eneme ne is puure ghatnakram ko durbhagyapurna bataate hue kaha ki is ghatana se nepal medical council (enemasi) kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal khadaa hua he
 NMC could also verify the certificate
 agar certificate galat paae jate to giraftaar se pehle in doctoron kaa license radd kiya janaa chahie tha
 35 of the 36 doctors arrested hold nmc-accredited licenses
 enemasi ke mahasachiv mukti ram shreshth ne desh ke doctoron se practice se pehle sarkaar se certificate satyapit karwaane kaa aadesh jari kiya he
 The release of the arrested doctors could not take place even after heavy protests in Birganj and an ultimatum of doctors to halt the emergency service

 tippaniyan Inzamam said, "to be honest, when Dave came, there were a lot of expectations from him
 mujhe nahin lagata ki vah ummid ke anuroop parinaam de paae hai
 "the main thing is that when the board appointed the foreign coach, it was emphasized that he would improve our team, but it has not happened since he has come," he said
 ’’ Watmore was appointed Pakistan's head coach in March 2012, replacing former Test player Mohsin Khan, since then his performance with the team has been widely criticized

 Bureaucrat-turned-minister Satyapal Singh has now transformed into a respected leader
 lagata he ki unhen raajnneeti bhaane lagi he
 Usually, the color of politics on bureaucrats descends as quickly as possible, but the color of saffron has become more intense on Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development Satyapal Singh
 chhattisgarh ke bilaspur main kendriya vishvavidhyalay ke dikshant samaaroh main hissaa lene pahunche satyapal singh ne kaha kipure desh kaa bhagavakaranhona chahie
 According to him, saffron is a symbol of knowledge and the color of the sun is also saffron
 bhagavakaran kii vakaalat karte hue satyapal singh ne kaha ki bhale hi bhartiya samaaj is rang ko sanyas kaa rang maanata he lekin yah aadhyatmik rang he
 On the other hand, Satyapal Singh has teased the Congressmen of the state by talking about the saffronisation of the country

 5 Star Artist: Nana Patekar, Gul Panag and Ashutosh Ranadirector: Aijaz Gulabana Patekar had become a shining star in gangster films when he knocked with 'ab Tak Chappan' a decade ago
 ab naanaa ne iske sikval ke saath vaapasi kii he
 Nana in the film seems to be the first monk Agashe
 bilkul usee tarah jaise vah 2004 main hua karte the
 Nanaki is now 64 years old, but his acting and body language is still as good as ever
 lekin nae diarector or kharaab production quality ne film kaa jaayaka bigaad kar rakh diya he
 Only Nana and Nana dominate the entire film
 unki acting or dialog delivery kamaal he
 The story of the film begins with former encounter specialist Sadhu Agashe who is living a retired life
 lekin halaat or dabaav kii vajah se sadhu ko phir se force main aana padataa he
 Then the same fight, the relationship of gangsters and leaders and then the same vicious cycle
 naanaa puri tarah se apane role main jamate hai, or gul panaag tathaa ashutosh rana bhi unka acha saath dete hai lekin kamjor kahani or angadh diarection saare kiye karaae par pani pher detaa he
 The film is completely reminiscent of the 1990s, but at a time when films like 'singham' and 'dabangg' are being made, making such a film at that time raises a finger on the understanding of the director and the producer
 jisaki vajah se naanaa kaa tallent bhi jaaya hota najar aata he
 Weak story and bad directions are not up to now 'chappan' name
 film main bhaashan kii jagah agar masaaledaar ection or majboot kahani par zyada dhyaan diya hota to baat hi kuch or hoti
 The film can be preferred in a single screen theater
 bahut badi kamyaabi kii ummid to kam hi he
 Anyway, this film is completely for Nana's fans

 bansal par kataaksh karte hue unhone kaha, ‘agar hamaare paas adhik sakasham sansadeey kaary mantri hota to teen mul sanshodhano main sabko samahit kiya ja saktaa tha
 ' gadakari ne kaha, chunki sarkaar loksabhaa main paarit lokapal vidheyak se jude samvidhan sanshodhan ko paarit karaane main naakaam rahi or rajyasabha main matdaan se bhaag khadi hui, ise dekhte hue use satta main bane rahane kaa koi naitik adhikaar nahin bachaa he
 Contrary to popular belief, running reduces inflammation in the knee joint and also slows down the process of osteoarthritis
 ek shodh main yah baat saamne ai he
 Matt Seeley, assistant professor of research and co-author of research at Brigham Young University in Utah, USA, said the idea that long-distance running is bad for your knees may be a myth
 shodh kaa prakaashan patrika 'european jarnal of aplide cycology' main kiya gaya he
 In this, the researchers measured the fluids of the knee joints that cause inflammation in many healthy women and men
 inaki umr 18-35 ke bich rahi
 It was measured both after and before running

 When the same fluid was extracted before and after the conditions without running, the swelling markers remained at the same level
 tippaniyan Robert Haldall, lead author of research at Brigham Young University, said that we found that exercise in young, healthy individuals creates a non-inflammatory environment that is beneficial for couples in the long run
 haldoul ke adhyayan ke parinaamon se sanket miltaa he ki vyaayaam se osteorthitis jaise rogon main jodon main apkshay vaali bimariyon main deree se shuruyaat main madadgaar hote hai
 The research is published in the journal 'european Journal of Applied Psychology'

 Researchers found that special markers extracted from the synovial fluid — two cytokines GM-CSF and IL-15 — decreased in participants 30 minutes after running

 'this poster has three pictures of Giriraj Singh, in which Union Animal Husbandry Minister is seen putting' Tilak 'on the forehead
 giriraaj singh ko is film main har garib va jaruratmand ke maseehaa ke taur par pesh kiya gaya he
 However, its roles have not yet been decided and the plot has not been finalized
 ab, giriraaj singh ne khud film nirmaataaon se un par is tarah ke poster nahin banane kaa aagrah kiya he, aise main film kaa bhavishya anishchit he
 Giriraj Singh is a Member of Parliament in the 17th Lok Sabha from Begusarai Parliamentary Constituency
 dilli-ensiaar main rape kii ghatnaayen lagaataar bad rahi hai

 rape kaa aarope sautele pita par laga he
 According to sources, her step-father raped the 7 and 14 year old girls

 On Tuesday, the relative brother in Gurgaon misbehaved with a child of five years

 Both the accused have been arrested by the police
 police remand main donon ko aamane-saamne baitaakar poochtacha kii jaaegi
 Along with this, the police will also try to know the crime sequence of that time so that both the poor people can be punished to the strictest on the basis of strong evidence
 rajasthan ke chunavi ran main siyaasi bisaat bich chuki he
 BJP President Amit Shah is making a stormy tour in Rajarajasthan and making contact with booth level workers
 to vahiin mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa tamgaa lekar janata ke bich ja rahi hai
 Congress is also engaged in making its power felt through a resolution rally
 hadoti kshetra kii baat karen to yah rajasthan kaa wo ilaaka he, jo hameshaa se bhaajapa kaa garh rahaa he
 In the last Legislative Assembly elections, out of 17 seats in Kota, Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar districts of Hadhuti, the Congress had to settle for just one seat
 jhalawad jile kii 4 vidhansabha seat-dag, jhalarapatan, khanpur, or manohar thana par sattadhari bijepi kaa kabja he
 Talking about Khanpur Assembly Constituency No
 199, this is a normal seat
 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar yahaan kii aabaadi 315623 he jiskaa 92
 Rural and 7 per cent share
 5 pratishat hissaa shahari he
 16 of the total population there
 11 fisadi anusuchit jati or 16
 8% are Scheduled Tribes
 iske alaava khanpur seat par jain matadaataaon kaa khaasaa prabhaav he
 Chandkhedi Adinath Digambar Jain Temple is of great importance to those who believe in Jainism
 2017 kii voter list ke anusaar khanpur main matadaataaon kii sankhya 209649 he or 267 poling booth hai
 In the 2013 assembly elections, this seat was voted at 81 percent
 vahiin 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main 64
 The turnout was 64 percent
 khanpur vidhansabha pichley teen chunaavon se bijepi kaa abhedya durg sabit hua he
 Result of 2013 Assembly Elections: In the 2013 assembly elections, Narendra Nagar of BJP defeated Sanjay Gurjar of Congress by 30956 votes
 bijepi ke narendra nagar ko 73955 or congress ke sanjay gurjar ko 42999 vot mili thea
 On the other hand, Anil Jain of NPP came third with 33624 votes
 2008 vidhansabha chunaav kaa parinamsaal 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke anil kumaar ne congress kii purv vidhayak minakshi chandravat ko 4955 maton se shikast di
 bjp's Anil Kumar got 63664 and Congress's Meenakshi Chandrawat received 58709 votes
 sansad main pehali baar endie kii sarkaar ko sankhya kii ahmiyat kaa pataa chal rahaa he
 Even though the BJP has 280 mps in the Lok Sabha, there are only 42 mps in the Rajya Sabha
 ek nazar daalate hai ki is ahm bill ko lekar rajyasabha main aakande kya kehete hai? rajyasabha ke kul 242 sadasyon main abhi endie ke 81 sadsy hai, vahiin upie ke paas 138 sadsy hai
 Apart from this, there are 23 others, including 9 nominated 10 independents and one MP each from four parties
 tab bhi endie bahumat ke liye zaruri 122 se kaafii kam he
 In such a situation even if TMC, BSP and SP go in favor of NDA, then the number of NDA will be 117 which is less than 122 required for majority
 vahiin agar tiemasi, bispi or sapa voting ke dauraan sadan se gairhaazir rahen to bahumat ke liye zaruri aankada ghat kar 104 rah jayega, lekin tab bhi endie ke 81 sadsy honge
 If the Insurance Bill is approved, there will be many major changes in the insurance sector
 iske mutabik desi beemaa companiyon main videshi nivesh kii seemaa badhkar 49 fisadi ho jaaegi, jo abhi 26 fisadi tak he
 According to the new bill, insurance companies can be listed on the stock exchange
 iske baad videshi companiyaan ko riinsurance companiyon main bhi nivesh kii ijazat milegi jo beemaa companiyon kaa beemaa karti hai
 At present, there are four government general insurance companies in the country, which are not allowed to raise capital from the country's stock market
 isse bharat main riinsurance sector main vikaas hoga, jahaan abhi sirf ek general insurance korporation yani jiaaisi hi ye kaam karata he
 All this is Manmohan Singh's policy, with which the Modi government also agrees
 aise main sarkaar ke paas vikalp kya he? ab ek upaay ho saktaa he ki donon sadanon kaa sanyukt adhiveshan bulaayaa jaae, magar phir kitne baar or kitne bilon par sanyukt adhiveshan bulaayaa jayega
 Another option could be to bargain with the opposition or to send the insurance bill to the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, or to deal with the Congress, because in 1999, this bill was brought by the Vajpayee government, then the Congress was opposed 
 phir jab 2008 main manmohan singh sarkaar yah bill lekar ai tab bijepi ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 The bill was then sent to a committee of Parliament, headed by Yashwant Sinha
 ab modi sarkaar yah bill lekar ai he, to congress apana tevar dikhaa rahi he
 It is a matter of time and numbers are important in a democracy
 haalanki congress kaa ek sahyogi ensipi beemaa bill ke samarthan main he or bijedy bhi
 
 magar sankhya ab bhi bahumat se kaaphi kam he
 In such a situation, the government will have to build its relationship with the Congress
 kai mudde hai jis par congress se baat ho sakati he, jaise loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad
 The post of the chairman of several parliamentary committees or the position of deputy speaker in the Lok Sabha
 yadi in sab chizon par baat ban jaati he to thik he
 The Congress will say that this is their own bill, which the NDA government is implementing
 varanaa sarkaar is bill ko kam se kam teen maheene ke liye bhul jaae yaa phir sansad ke is satr ke baad sanyukt satr bulaae
 a Delhi court ordered framing of charges against the dismissed CWG Organizing Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi and others in the Commonwealth Games (CWG) scams

 dilli ke ek rihaayshi ilaake main kuch maah pehle subah-subah ek laash milti he
 a corpse cut into seven pieces and packed in a cartun box and bag
 laash ke tukdon se saafe pataa chal rahaa tha ki ye laash kisi ladki kii he
 But in the initial investigation neither the identity of the deceased is known nor there is any clue of the killers
 lekin phir achaanak cartoon par likhe kuch harf police ko pehla suraag de jate hai
 This was actually the address of a courier company
 to kya mahaz is pate ke zarie police qaatil tak pahunch paaegi?21 june, 2018, subah 8:30 baje, sarita vihaar, dilliek ghaney rihaayshi ilaake se sate is kudaghar main logon kii nigaah do aisi chizon par padi, jo aam taur par kachare ke dher main nahin hoti
 It was a big bag and a packed cartun box near the bag
 lekin sirf in do chizon ne logon kaa dhyaan apni ore nahin khinchaa, balki inase aati badboo se bhi log pareshaan the
 The foreheads of the people were taken care of and they informed the police
 agle chand minuton main dilli police mauka e vaardaat par thi
 But after rinsing the bag and box, the steps of the policemen stopped
 bag main ek ladki kii laash thi
 That too in seven different pieces
 haath, pair, sir, gardan sab alag-alag
 Police recovered the body and sent it for postmortem
 zaahir he, jis tarah laash saat alag-alag tukdon main kaat kar bag or cartoon main bhar kar nipataai gai thi, usase ye to saafe tha ki maamla qatl kaa he
 But who was the dying girl? Where did you live? Who killed him? Under what circumstances did such pieces of corpse be made? All these questions were still unresolved
 vaise police ko in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane or qaatil tak pahunchane ke liye sabase pehle maranevaali ladki kii pahchaan kerani zaruri thi
 But the problem was that despite questioning the people around and telling the full story of the bag and cartun, the dying girl could not be identified
 yahaan tak ki ladki ne jo kapade pahane the, police ne aas-paas ke logon ko wo kapade bhi dikhaae, lekin kahin koi suraag nahin mila
 Many went out in this effort everyday
 isi bich tafteesh ke dauraan police kii nazar ek aisi chiz par padi, jisase use ummid hone lagi ki shaayad isse maranevaali kaa koi suraag mil jaae
 The cartoons were thrown into the cartoons by the murderers, who had written the address of a courier company
 police ne sochaa shaayad is pate se hi koi rasta nikle
 She immediately reached the office of that courier company in Gurugram and there she showed pictures of the cartun box to the officers of the company
 ittefaq se courier vaale ne box kii pahchaan kar lee or bataaya ki is tarah ke bade box main unke ek customer ne yuai se parcel book karavaaya tha
 The name of the customer was Javed Akhtar
 ab police courieravaale ke bataae pate par sidhe javed akhtar ke ghar aligarh pahunchi
 Javed Na got only the police here, while also identifying the picture of his cartun box
 usne bataaya ki usne teen saal pehle aise kai cartoon box main yuai se kuch zarurat kii chizein mangvayi thim
 Some of these boxes where he gave to his maid, while some boxes were kept in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh house
 shahinbagh ke us makaan main kuch ladke kiraye par rahete the
 Now the police turned to Shaheen Bagh of Delhi
 police kii sari ummid ab isi makaan par aakar tik gai thi
 Whatever clue was to be found was to meet here
 police kii team javed akhtar kii naukaraani ke paas pahunchi
 Empty boxes were found there, after which when the police reached Javed's house in Shaheen Bagh, there was a lock
 isse police kaa shaq sajid ali par gaharaa ho gaya
 The police started collecting information about Sajid from nearby people, then it turned out that he had told the people there that he was leaving the house empty
 ab police ko talash thi sajid ali ansaari kii
 Many police teams started searching for him
 or aakhirkaar wo police ke hathe chadh hi gaya
 The story Sajid told the police after being caught is shocking
 sajid ali ne police ko bataaya ki uskaa aksar apni patni ke saath jhagada hota tha
 There were two reasons for the quarrel, one was his relationship with another girl and his unemployment
 isi vajah se usne apni patni ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 20- On the night of 21 June, he strangled his wife to death
 phir apane donon bhaaiyon ke saath milakar uski laash ke kai tukade kiye
 And put the corpse in a parcel box and set it up
 police ke mutabik sajid ali ko lag rahaa tha ki is vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad wo batch jayega lekin aisa hua nahin
 That parcel box exposed his plot
 poochtacha main sajid ne police ko bataaya ki uski patni hindu thi, saal 2011 main padhai ke dauraan uski mulaakaat rajbala se hui thi
 Later both of them got married and the wife's name was changed to Juhi
 sajid peshey se beatech ejeeniyar he, lekin uske paas koi naukari nahin he
 Currently the three accused brothers are now behind bars
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he, yah jaanane ke liye is video ko jarur dekhen, taaki bhavishya main jab aap bhi kisi apane ke saath nijee yaa antarang baatcheet karen to apni niztaa ko bachaakar rakh saken

 com / uujgoyhxsn— Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) May 7, 2018 At the pm's rally on Congress, Modi criticized the Congress for celebrating 'jubilees of Sultans' for vote bank politics
 modi kaa ishaara sambhavat: 18veen sadi ke mysore ke shaasha tipu sultan kii yaad main har saal 10 november ko 'tipu jayanti' manaane ke rajya kii siddharamaiya sarkaar ke faisle kii ore tha
 Modi accused the Congress of having no agenda except saving the corrupt, adopting a policy of divide and rule, making false promises and abusing Modi
 karnataka main bijepi kii sarkaar banane kaa daawamaharashtra or tripura sahit congress kii chunavi haar ko ginate hue unhone kaha ki desh ke har kone se congress ja chuki he
 He asked the crowd, '
 
 
 or karnataka main?' iske jawaab main bheed ne kaha ki isdakshini rajyase bhi congress kaa safaya ho jayega
 Modi said, 'now they cannot escape
 congress ko ab koi nahin bachaa saktaa
 For 70 years he has misled and fooled people
 ' rajya main 12 may ko chunaav honge or voton kii ginati 15 may ko hogi
 In his rally in Chitradurga, Modi, without naming a minister, referred to allegations of corruption against him, saying, 'congress is a party that neither has the heart nor is it a Dalit supporter
 vah ek deal party he
 In Raichur, he said that the new mantra of Congress is to spread lies
 unhone kaha ki congress daliton ko gumraah kar rahi he or jhooth failaa rahi he
 Modi's attack on sonia-rahul said in Jamkhandi that Ramnath Kovind, the son of a poor mother who grew up in the village, is going to have a year to become president
 lekin madam sonia ji ko unase shishtachar mulaakaat karne ke liye vakt nahin mil paaya he
 He said that the President may be a Dalit but his office is an institution and the Congress, which has ruled the country for 70 years, does not have that much discretion (to meet them)
 modi ne congress par karnataka ko dharm, bhashaa or sampradaay ke aadhaar par baantne kii koshish karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha, 'ham karnataka ko bantane nahin denge
 He was probably referring to the giving of religious minority status to Veerashaiva and Veerashaiva Lingayat
 darasal, in samudaayon ko BJP kaa paramparaagat vot bank mana jaataa he
 Modi also attacked Siddaramaiah, targeting Siddaramaiah from contesting elections from two places and said that he had run away from Chamundeshwari seat so that he could escape and come to Badami here
 unhone bheed se kaha ki ve yahaan se bhi unhen vidaa karen
 He said that the Karnataka election is a contest between the evil deeds of the Congress and the aspirations of the people
 unhone kaha ki ek ore jahaan BJP kaa mantra 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' he, vahiin duusari ore congress ek parivaar ke liye hi sabakuch karne main yakeen rakhti he
 Attacking the Congress in Chitradurga on Tipu Jayanti, he said, look at the character of the Congress
 
 
 un logon kii jayanti manaae jane kii jarurat he jinase ham peedi dar peedi prerana lete hai
 But those people cannot think of celebrating his birth anniversary
 karnataka chunaav main 'tip sultan'unhone kaha ki veeraa maadakari or onek obaava ko bhuulaa diya gaya lekin vot bank kii raajnneeti kii khatir ve log sultaanon kii jayantiyaan manaa rahe hai
 Dalit woman Onake Obava was the wife of an army soldier of Madkari Nayak, the last ruler of Chitradurga
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone akele hi 1779 main tipu sultan ke pita haidar ali kii sena ke kai sainikon ko maar giraaya
 However, Hyder's soldiers killed him
 modi ne kaha ki tipu jayanti manaa kar congress ne karnataka or chitradurg ke logon kaa apmaan kiya he
 He has played with the feelings of the people of Chitradurga
 hubli main modi ne kaha ki BJP ke paas desh or karnataka ke liye sapana he
 He asked Congress what is his dream? For him, the world starts with family and ends with family
 unhone kaha, 'congress kii duniya vanshavaad or bhrashtachar main he
 Our goal is to get the country out of it

 dilli metro kii world class image ko ek video se jabardast dhakka laga he
 The video is of the signal room at a station in the Delhi Metro and water streams started to erupt during the rain, filling the entire signal room
 wo to ganimat rahi ki sahi vakt par dilli metro ke karmchaariyon ne tirpal or duusari waterpruf chizon se dhankkar singhling ke puure system ko barish ke pani se bachaa liya, varanaa metro kaa network bhi thap ho saktaa tha
 According to sources, it is from the Indelok metro station of the Videometroki Green Line ie Indralok Mundka Line, where the rain water started dripping in the signal room through the roof and the gradual dripping process turned into fast streams of water
 metro sutron ke mutabik is room main signling system ke mahatvapurn upkaran or mashine maujuud thim, jisasemetroca automatic oparation sanchalit hota he
 When the metro train will arrive, where will it stop on the platform and in how long will it move ahead of the platform, all these things are decided by automatic train operation and its entire basis is based on the singling
 aise main metro kii laaparvaahee se indralok line kaa puraa metro network thap ho saktaa tha
 Information about the video was sought from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation via email
 metrose poocha ki yah video kis metro stesan kaa he or signal room main pani kaise bhar gaya? kaise signal room kii puri chat bahane lagi or upkarnon ko barish ke pani se bachaane ke liye tirpal tak lagane pade? is laaparvaahee ke liye koun zimmedaar he or is bare main ab tak metro kii taraf se kya karrwai kii gai?haalanki dmarsi kii taraf se ab tak koi jawaab nahin mila he, lekin metro ke afasaron ne anaupchaarik taur par yah sweekaara he ki video metro ke hi signal room kaa he
 However, the metro is still silent on the date of the video
 agar pani signling system main ghus jaataa, upkaran pani se bhig jate or mashine kharaab ho jaatin, to metro line kaa puraa signling system thap ho jaataa
 The entire network is not affected, but the track circuit could be jammed on an entire line, so that the train where it was standing would stop and run in manual mode to push it further, in which the speed is very low and The track circuit gets jammed in a short time
 jaankaron ke mutabik yah ek badi laaparvaahee thi, kyonki aisa hone par us line par chal rahi tamaam trainon kaa aaparishan control room se sampark tut jaataa
 Although there is no underground section on the Mundka line, otherwise there would have been such negligence on an underground section, a train full of passengers could have been trapped inside the tunnel

 Now it seems that the Central Government and the State Government are face to face
 mangalvaar ko kashmir ke aiji munir khan ne kaha he ki abhi bhi lipul gogoi ke khilaaf jaanch jari rahegi, unhone kaha ki unke khilaaf exiaar pehle se hi darj he
 We do not know anything that came in this decision, but the investigation will continue
 aapako bataa den ki somvaar ko hi sena namejar lipul gogoico sammanit kiya tha
 He has been honored by a citation on behalf of the Army Chief for his distinguished service
 isse pehle is ghatana ke khilaaf janaakrosh ko dekhte hue sena ne is major ke khilaaf court of inquairi baithai thi lekin is jaanch main major gogoi ko clin chit mil gai thi
 Omar Abdullah had tweeted that the incident of tying the video man's youth Farooq Ahmed in front of the jeep is on April 9
 is ghatana kaa video clip umr abdulla ne twit kar jaanch kii maang kii thi
 The video went viral on social media and the Indian Army was also severely criticized against it
 haalanki kuch logon ne sena kii is karrwai kaa samarthan bhi kiya tha
 In this case, on 15 April, two days after the Jammu and Kashmir Police lodged an FIR against Major Nitin Gogoi of 53 Rashtriya Rifles, the Court of Inquiry was set up
 jaanch ke baad major ke khilaaf kisi tarah kii karrwai naa karne kii anushansa kii gai
 Even Major's decision was praised by senior officials as it was seen as a better way of dealing with stone pelting

 Election Results 2019 :loksabhaa chunaav parinaam se thik pehle bhartiya janata party adhyaksh amit shah (amit Shah) ne iviem(evm) par sawaal khadey karne vaali partiyon kii niyat par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 He (amit Shah) tweeted that the opposition to EVM is a disrespect to the mandate of the people of the country
 haar se baukhalaai yah 22 partiyaan desh kii loktantric prakriya par sawalia nishaan uthaa kar vishwa main desh or apane loktantr kii chhavi ko dhoomil kar rahi he
 He (amit Shah) said that the questions being raised by the opposition on evms are only an attempt to spread misconception, without which we should all try to strengthen our democratic institutions
 main in sabhi partiyon se kuch prashn poochna chahta hum
 Opposition to EVM is disrespect to the mandate of the people of the country
 haar se baukhalaai yah 22 partiyaan desh kii loktantric prakriya par sawalia nishaan uthaa kar vishwa main desh or apane loktantr kii chhavi ko dhoomil kar rahi he
 i want to ask all these parties some questions

 com / yckqvvolq0prashn-1 : EVM kii vishwasaneeyata par prashn uthaane vaali in adhikansh vipakshi partiyon ne kabhi na kabhi EVM dwaara hue chunaavon main vijay praapt kii he
 If they do not have faith in EVM, then why did these parties handle the power thread on winning the election? Question-2: The Supreme Court of the country has finalized the electoral process after taking cognizance of more than three pils
 jisamen kii har vidhansabha kshetra main paanch VVPAT ko ginaney kaa aadesh diya he
 So are you also questioning the order of the Supreme Court? Question-3: Just two days before the counting of votes, the demand of change in electoral process by 22 opposition parties is completely unconstitutional because any such decision is taken by the consensus of all parties
 Is not possible without prashn-4: vipaksh ne EVM ke vishay par hangaamaa chah charnon kaa matdaan samaapt hone ke baad shuru kiya
 This became more acute after the exit poll
 eczit pole EVM ke aadhaar par nahin balki matadaata se prashn puch kar kiya jaataa he
 So how can you question the credibility of EVM based on exit poll? Q-5: Taking proactive steps on the subject of disturbances in EVM, the Election Commission had publicly challenged and invited its performance
 parantu us chunauti ko kisi bhi vipakshi dal ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 After this, the Election Commission made EVM more transparent by linking it to VVPAT
 VVPAT prakriya ke aane ke baad matadaata mat dene ke baad dekh saktaa he ki uskaa mat kis party ko register hua
 How reasonable is it to raise questions after the process is so transparent? Question-6: Some opposition parties are making objectionable statements such as 'taking up arms' and "shedding of blood" if the election results are not favorable
 vipaksh bataaye ki aise hinsaatmak or aloktantric bayaan ke dwaara vah kise chunauti de rahaa he?gauratlab he kichunaav ayog ke vipakshi dalon kii matganana se pehle VVPAT-EVM kaa milan karne kii maang ko thukraa diya he
 On Tuesday, 22 opposition parties made this demand from the Election Commission
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election) ke nattejey aane se pehle vipaksh kii VVPAT-EVM kaa milan pehle karne kii maang ko chunaav ayog ne khaarij kar diya he
 On the issue of evms and vvpats, leaders of 22 major opposition parties, including Congress, SP, BSP, Trinamool Congress, moved the Election Commission on Tuesday and urged them to match VVPAT slips at select polling stations before the counting of votes
 vipakshi dalon ne yah bhi kaha tha ki yadi kisi ek matdaan centre par bhi vivipieti parchiyon kaa milan sahi nahin paaya jaataa to sambandhit vidhansabha kshetra main sabhi vivipieti parchiyon kii ginati kii jaae
 Opposition leaders had demanded action on complaints related to the alleged transfer of evms from Strongroom to several places
 congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne samvaadadaataaon kaha tha ‘‘hamanen maang kii he ki vivipieti parchiyon kaa milan pehle kiya jaae or phir matganana kii jaae
 These are our biggest demands
 ''vahiin, basapa ke danish ali ne kaha tha ki strong room ko lekar jo shikaayatein thim ve hamane chunaav ayog ke samaksh rakhi hai
 Actually, the administration of Uttar Pradesh is arbitrary because the BJP knows what the verdict of the people has given
 ab ve herapheri karnaa chaahate hai
 Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu had said that the Election Commission should ensure that there is no tampering of the mandate
 chunaav ayog kaa rukh karne se pehle vipakshi netaaon ne constitution club main baithak kii thi
 In the meeting of opposition leaders, Ahmed Patel, Ashok Gehlot, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Abhishek Manu Singhvi from Congress, Sitaram Yechury from CPI, Derek o'brien from Trinamool Congress, Chandrababu Naidu from TDP, Arvind Kejriwal from Aam Aadmi Party, Ram Gopal Yadav from SP, BSP Satish Chandra Mishra and Danish Ali from DMK, Kanimozhi from DMK, Manoj Jha from RJD, Praful Patel from NCP and Majid Memon and leaders of many other parties joined in

 australia ke salaami ballebaaj aron finch ne kaha he ki yadi chayankarta unhen mauka dete hai to vah ek baar phir se team kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai
 After a one-year ban on Steve Smith and David Warner in the ball tempering case, the team has started looking for captains and vice-captains for limited overs
 haalanki tim pen ko test captain bana diya gaya he, lekin abhi vanade or tii-20 ke liye captain chune jane baaki hai
 Finch told the Cricket Australia website, 'I am definitely ready for this
 lekin eemaandaaree se kahuun to maine iske bare main sochaa nahin he
 Frankly, it is a difficult moment for the team
 'ball tempring vivaad ke baad kaamanwealth games ne australia kii pratishtha phir se kaayam kii: peter batiegency ke mutabik 31 saal ke finch 2014 main tii-20 praaroop main australia ke captain niyukt hue the, lekin unhone sirf chah maichon hi captaini kii thi or baad 2016 tii-20 world cap se pehle smith ko captaini saunp di gai
 Finch said, 'for the series of odis and T20 matches, the team has to tour England in June
 iske baad july main zimbabwe main tii-20 tri siries bhi khelni he
 In such a situation, some changes are going to happen in the next few months

 ' 'unke dekhe se jo aa jaati he munh par raunak, wo samajhate hai ki biimaar kaa haal acha he

 It is being talked about Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar who is suffering from a serious illness
 nijee yatra par goa gaye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kal unase milane unke daftar pahunch gaye the
 Later in a meeting of booth level activists in Kochi, he referred to Parrikar and said that he had denied his role in the Rafale deal
 yahi baat rahul gandhi ne aaj talkatoraa stadium main doharaai
 After this Parrikar has written a letter to Rahul Gandhi
 unhone rahul gandhi ke bayaan kii ninda kii
 In the letter, Parrikar wrote that he came to meet him on the pretext of inquiring about the condition of the disease but he used this meeting to address his low-level political interests
 parrikar ne likhaa ki rahul bina kisi purv soochna ke unase milane aa gaye
 Parrikar wrote that neither Rafael was mentioned in the five-minute meeting nor did he have any discussion about Rafael
 parrikar ne likhaa ki ve pehle bhi kai baar kah chuke hai or ek baar phir kah rahe hai ki rafel sauda do sarkaron ke bich he or isamen sabhi niyamon kaa paalan kiya gaya
 There is no disturbance in this far and wide
 yah puri prakriya rashtriya suraksha kii praathamiktaaon ke aadhaar par tay niamakon ke tahat hui he
 Parrikar further wrote that coming to my house on the pretext of a courtesy visit, then making such a low level false political statement exposes your motives and intentions to come to my house
 parrikar likhte hai ki ve beemaari main apane jivan ke astitv kii ladaai lard rahe hai or goa kii seva main lage hai
 He finally pleaded with Rahul not to make any ill and unhealthy motive for his opportunistic politics
 iske turant baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa twit bhi aa gaya
 He wrote, Dear Rahul Gandhi, you showed how insensitive you are by lying in the name of a person struggling with the disease
 bharat ke log aapke vyavhaar se vyathit hai
 Manohar Parrikar has told the situation
 udhar, congress ke sutron ne kaha he ki rahul gandhi yah pehle hi spasht kar chuke hai ki yah ek nijee mulaakaat thi
 If you see Parrikar's letter, you will find that he has not written anywhere that he was aware of the cancellation of the Rafale deal
 rahul gandhi ne aaj yahi aarope lagaaya he
 According to Congress leaders, Rahul Gandhi did not say that in yesterday's meeting Parrikar gave him any information about Rafael
 lekin sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki jis tarah se achaanak rahul gandhi parrikar se milane pahunche or uske baad unhone parrikar kaa naam lekar pehle kochi main phir dilli main bayaan diya usase kya yah matlab nahin nikalataa ki is mulaakaat ke peeche makasad sirf haalchaal poochna hi nahin balki kuch or bhi tha
 So what is the truth of this? Is Rahul's point right or Parrikar's? Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are the personal views of the author

 Head coach of the Indian cricket team Ravi Shastri said that it was a mistake to include Kuldeep Yadav in the playing XI in the second Test match played against England at Lord's
 shastri ne kuldeep ko duusare test match main khilaane ke sawaal par kaha, 'saaf taur par dekha jaae, to yah galati thi
 Given the circumstances, we could have played more of a fast bowler in the playing eleven
 isse hamen jarur madad milti
 'I am ready for the start of the innings in the Test: In the Rohitplaying XI, however, defending his move, Coach Shastri said,' If you look, you could not have guessed the rain
 hamen kuldeep kii jarurat padati, lekin duusare test match kii paristhitiyon ko dekhen to tej gendbaaj behatar vikalp hota
 Apart from this, Shastri has demanded more discipline and patience from the batters of the team struggling before the third Test match
 PAK ja rahe cricketron se bole the atal- khel hi nahin dil bhi jeet kar aanashasthri ne kaha, ‘is siries main paristhitiyaan kaaphi mushkil rahi he
 But in such a situation you get an opportunity to show passion and discipline
 apko of stump ke bare main pataa hona chahie or kaaphi gendon ko chhodana hoga
 You have to be ready to show patience
