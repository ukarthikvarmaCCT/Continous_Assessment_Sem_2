 Lalu Prasad, who has been troubled by dogs and mosquitoes for the last one week, finally got some relief on Wednesday

 The most heart-breaking separation in Hollywood has been that of actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolly
 ek saal se alag rah rahe is kapal ke bare main aae din khabaren aati rahati hai
 According to a recent report, Brad Pitt has admitted that leaving first wife Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolly has proved to be the biggest mistake of her life

 The PDP has emerged as the largest party, followed by BJP
 jahaan pidipi ko pichhali baar 21 siten mili thi or is baar 28 mili he, vahiin bijepi ke hisse pichley baar 11 thi or is baar 25 siten ai hai
 The BJP fielded only 75 candidates against the PDP, National Conference and Congress and won 25
 siton ke aadhaar par bhale hi pidipi number van ho par vot pratishat ke hisaab se bijepi number van he
 The BJP got 22 percent of the votes while the PDP got 22
 7 fisadi
 bjp's vote percentage 12 in the last election
 5 fisadi tha to is baar ye badhkar 23 phisadi tak pahunch gaya
 At the same time, even today, it is being said that the lotus of the BJP has not blossomed in Kashmir elections, but in the true sense, for the first time in Kashmir, the lotus has blossomed in the snow water, that is, it has won by defeating
 
 ho saktaa he, kai logon ko meri baat par yakeen nahin hoga par pehali baar ghati main har jagah bijepi kii hi charchaa thi
 For the first time BJP posters and flags were seen at many places
 pehali baar khuleam bijepi ke ummidavaar prachaar karte najar aae
 For the first time in 31 years, a Prime Minister was seen doing bjp's election rally in the open field
 pehali baar kashmir ghati main bijepi ko dhai fisadi ke kareeb vot mili
 For the first time, 33 of its candidates were in the fray in the valley
 pichley chunaav main bijepi ko mahaj puure kashmir main sirf 14 hajaar hi vot mili the jabaki is baar ye badhkar 48 hajaar tak pahunch chukaa he
 39 central BJP leaders gathered here
 or to or har baar hone vaale chunaavon main apni jamaanat tak jabt karaane vaali bijepi kai siton par duusare number par to kai jagahon par tisare number par rahi
 All these things become more important because before this election, bjp's flag was never seen in any election nor did it get candidates here
 chunavi prachaar or raily kii baat to bahut dur rahi
 The condition was that nobody even liked to talk about BJP
 ek aisi 'achhut' party jiske paas jane se har kashmiri main bachataa tha
 But now the situation has changed
 tabhi to kabhi algaavvaadi netaa kahe jane vaale sajaad lone pradhanmantri modi ko bade bhai kehete hai
 Hina Bhatt, who is considered the face of BJP in Kashmir, says that bjp's lotus has blossomed in Kashmir and please do not judge it by electoral victory or defeat
 or to or ghati ke donon mukhya dal neshnal conferes or pidipi ke netaa ko ummid he ki kashmir ke halaat sudharenge to wo modi or bijepi kii badaulat hi sambhav ho paaegaa
 Jammu and Kashmir BJP leader Ramesh Arora says that our party's strategy for Jammu and Kashmir has been completely successful
 aisa pehali baar hua he ki vidhansabha chunaav main dhaandhlee ke aarope nahin lage hai
 By the way, the BJP thought that if it could not form a government on its own, then its role should not be ignored under any circumstances
 bijepi or khud modi ke agenda main kashmir kitna khaas he iskaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri banane ke baad shaayad hi aisa koi maheenaa beetaa ho jab modi kashmir nahin gaye hon
 This time, if the percentage of polling in Jammu and Kashmir has increased by five per cent as compared to the previous time, then its credit also goes to BJP
 khud bijepi ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki modi ke dar kii vajah se algaavvaadiyon ne chunaav bykaat kii apil nahin kii
 Due to Modi's opposition, the people of Kashmir came out of the houses so that under any circumstances the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir should not become the BJP
 bijepi kii chhavi bhi kashmir main muslim virdohi kii rahi he or rahi kasar chunaav ke dauraan desh ke kai hisson main dharmantaran ko lekar bijepi or usase jude netaaon ke bayanon ne puri kar di
 i have been watching Kashmir continuously for fifteen years
 lekin in chunaavon me jis tarah ke badlaav kii sugabgaahat sunai di wo ek naye raajnneetik mukaam kaa sanket de rahi he
 The manner in which BJP has registered a presence in Kashmir even after less preparation and without any solid ground, it seems that in the coming years, it is possible to feed lotus in Dal Lake by not only being restricted to Jammu
 mumbai main bandra-varali ceilink ke duusare charan ke udghaatan samaaroh main apni maujuudagi par uthe vivaad ko lekar amitabh bachchan ne apane virodhiyon ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki is mudde par vivaad jaanboojhkar paidaa kiya gaya he

 "congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi told reporters" the party is aware of what happened

 Party workers are unhappy because Bachchan has associated himself with Modi
 ’ bachchan ne kaha ki jo gujarat ke saath sambandhon ko lekar naaraaz hai unke paas rajya main nivesh karne evam safal udhyam chalaane se ‘kisi ratan tata athwa kisi ambani’ ko rokane kaa saahas nahin he
 He said, "do you have the courage to tell them not to belong to the state and take back all their investment and human labor from there? i think not
" aap kisi maamle main raajnneeti laa sakate hai lekin us vyakti kaa kya hoga jo gaiyr raajnneetik he

 The Supreme Court gave its verdict on Thursday in the case of Delhi Government vs Lieutenant Governor
 do jajon kii peeth ke faisle ke baad bhi maamla abhi puri tarah se sulajhaa nahin he, haalanki kuch muddon jajon ne apana faisla saaf kiya he
 There was a difference of opinion between the two judges on the issue of transfer-posting of central cadre officers, so the issue has been referred to a larger bench
 is masale par justise eke sikri or justise ashok bhushan kii peeth ne sunwaayee kii he
 First Justice AK Sikri read his decision
 maamle main faisla padhate hue justise sikri ne kaha ki rajdhani main sabhi akjicutive adhikaar dilli sarkaar ke paas hi rahenge
 Justice Ashok Bhushan also agreed with Justice Sikri on some issues, but the two judges differed on the issue of transfer-posting, so the issue has been referred to a larger bench
 haalanki, dilli main jameen, police or kanoon vyavastha se jude sabhi adhikaar centre sarkaar yani uparajyapal ke paas hi rahenge
 However, this is not yet a final decision as there appears to be differences in the two judges' benches
 justise sikri ne apane faisle main kaha ki kisi afasar kii niyukti yaa phir transfar ko lekar uparajyapal rajya sarkaar ke mantrimandal kii salaah par faisla le sakate hai
 He said that the decision of the Lt
 Governor, and DANICS-DANIPS, for the transfer-posting of the IPS, will remain with the Chief Minister
 unhone suzav diya ki DASS or DANICS ke adhikariyon ke mudde par ek cameti kaa gathan kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the order of the Supreme Court, now the Delhi government can fix the circle rate of land in the capital
 justise ashok bhushan ne bhi ACB, kamishan of inquairi ke mudde par justise sikri ke faisle main hi sahmati jataai he
 Justice Ashok Bhushan said that the right to Danics will remain with the government, but lg's consent is also necessary
 agar koi vivaad rahata he ki donon paksh raashtrapati ke paas ja sakate hai
 The President has the authority to take disciplinary action against the officers
 sabhi pakshon ko sunne ke baad is peeth ne 3 maheene pehle yani ek november ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Last week, the Delhi government raised the issue before the bench and requested for an early verdict in the case
 dilli sarkaar kii ore se peeth ko anurodh kiya gaya ki is sambandh main faisla jald sunaaya jaae kyonki prashasan chalaane main kai dikkatein aa rahi he
 Last year, the Constitution Bench, while giving its verdict, said that except for the police, law and order and land in Delhi, the Lt
 Governor will not interfere in any other work of the Delhi Government
 supreme court ke us faisle main kaha gaya tha ki uparajyapal ko dilli sarkaar kii salaah par kaam karnaa hoga or agar kisi mudde par sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich vivaad ho jaae to uparajyapal use raashtrapati ke samaksh refer karenge
 However, after this decision, the Delhi government said that despite the decision of the Constitution Bench, the deadlock on many issues remain
 tab faisla sunaate hue supreme court ke chif justise deepak mishra ne kaha tha ki uparajyapal ko dilli sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Delhi Legislative Police can legislate on any subject other than land and public order
 saath hi supreme court ne dilli hai court ke us faisle ko bhi puri tarah se ulat diya, jisamen hai court ne uparajyapal ko dilli kaa asli bos bataaya tha
 The High Court had told the Lieutenant Governor that the Bosshai court had in its judgment described the Lieutenant Governor as the boss of Delhi
 dilli hai court ne 4 agast 2016 ko is masale par sunwaayee karte hue kaha tha ki uparajyapal hi dilli ke prashasnic pramukh hai or dilli sarkaar uparajyapal kii marji ke bina kanoon nahin bana sakati
 According to the High Court's decision, the Lieutenant Governor is not bound to accept the Delhi Government's decision and he can take the decision on the basis of his discretion, along with obtaining permission of LG before issuing any kind of notification to the Delhi Government
 Will be
 dilli hai court ke is faisle ke khilaaf hi rajya kii aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha

 On the other hand, India has rejected this claim of the neighboring country outright
 pakistani khufia agency iesai ne ek bayaan jari karke kaha- 'pioke ke bhimber main ghusebhartiya drone cosena ne gira diya
 This drone came to Pakistan in violation of airspace
 'pakistani akhbaar don kii report ke mutabik, is maamle main pakistani sena kaa daawa he ki bhartiya sena drone ke jariye unki khufia jaankariyaan hasil karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Attempts were made to capture the pictures of POK through the SP cameras installed in the drone

 The Indian Army and the Indian Air Force, however, rejected the claim that one of their drones had been killed or crashed
 bhartiya sena ke pravaktaa ne kaha ‘paak adhikrut kashmir main ek drone durghatana kii kuch khabaren hai
 Any drone or UAV of the Indian Army has crashed
 ’ bhartiya vaayu sena ke pravaktaa ne bhi is baat se inkaar kiya ki unka koi drone maar giraaya gaya he
 Do you know about universal basic income? Can the government give basic income to all people? What is basic income? Is this unemployment allowance? Is this an old age pension? Can any government give basic income to crores of people? duniya bhar main is par baat hone lagi he
 Not being given anywhere right now
 tamaam yojanaon ko dekhenge to sarkaar nagarikon ke ek tabake ko madad raashi detii he
 But universal basic income looks different
 chand lekh pard kar laga ki iskaa matlab yahi he ki sarkaar sabhi ko yani garibi rekha se neeche ke logon se lekar ham aap jaise logon ko basic inakam de
 a fixed amount by month
 isi saal june main is baat ko lekar janamat sangrah hua ki bina shart sabhi ko basic inakam dene ke liye samvidhan main badlaav karnaa chahie
 There was a lot of debate, campaigning took place
 sarkaar or sansad ne virodh kiya ki isse to log kaam nahin karenge or ek din kaam laayak log nahin milenge
 Switzerland is not only a country with a better standard of living in Europe
 80 fisadi aabaadi ke paas kaam he, aise desh main universal basic inakam ko lekar bahes hui ki sabhi naagarik ko har maheene sarkaar 2,524 dollar de
 This motion was defeated in the referendum
 77 fisadi vot se yah prastaav riject ho gaya
 The idea has been debated in many countries of Europe
 kai raajnneetik dal hai jo ab ise apane ghoshnapatron main jagah dene lage hai
 Canada, Finland and the Netherlands are also considering holding a referendum on it
 abhi apane aap se maahaul main aap yahi sunate honge ki sarkaar ko lok kalyankari rajya kii dharna se mukti paa leni chahie
 The government's job is to create an environment of business or employment
 sarkaar ke khate main sabsidi kaa hissaa kam se kam hona chahie lekin agar sarkarein kabhi is niti par pahunchati hai ki sabhi yogya ayogy nagarikon ko basic selary jaisi koi raashi di jaaegi to phir sabsidi kam karne vaale tarkon kaa kya hoga
 That stream has become so strong that now when someone talks about universal basic income, then it will feel that someone is cooking an empty casserole
 koi puraane jamaane kaa communist hoga, yaa phir socialist
 How strange is this idea in the world that has gone on capitalism
 magar yah khyaal panpa hi he amir deshon main jahaan communist party kaa koi aadhaar tak nahin he
 y Combinator is a company in Silicon Valley, USA
 ye funding company he
 It has announced to start a pilot project on basic income in California
 company kaa kahana he ki wo is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chaahati he ki basic inakam kaa bhugtan kaise hoga, iskaa data kaise jamaa hoga
 The president of the company says that due to the way technology is leaving jobs, one day basic income will have to be implemented
 ek aalochana he ki isse to sarkaar garibon ko chhod middle class ko paisa dene lagegi
 As a result, poverty may only increase
 kair vaai combinetor california ke sau pariwaron kaa chayan karegi
 Whether it is in a job or not
 unhen har maheene 1000 se 2000 dollar degi
 To see how their life changes
 aap bhi meri tarah soch rahe honge ki agar sarkaar sabhi ko basic inakam dene lage to koi kaam hi nahin karegaa
 People will become lazy

 Many people feel that the problem in this scheme is less because you do not put the eligibility conditions whether it will be received or not
 ham aksar ye nahin sochate ki jinhen kaam nahin mil rahaa he unki haalat kya hoti he
 There is a scheme like MNREGA in India which talks about giving employment for at least 100 to 150 days
 hakeekat main bhale puri tarah se logon ko rojgaar na miltaa ho lekin kya ye skim universal basic inakam jaisi yojana kaa chota rup nahin he

 They believe that this scheme should be tried in India
 iske model kya honge, iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega, ye sab sawaal to hai lekin hamaare dimaag main maujuuda dhaancha is kadar ghus gaya he ki yah vichaar yaa to bekaar lagata he yaa phir samaj se baahar
 The world of technology is changing rapidly
 aap aae din akhabaaron ke rangeen pannon main padhate honge ki bina dryver ke car or bas chalaane kii technology viksit kii ja rahi he
 This trial is in its final stages

 america ke wal street main do exange oparator ne elaan kiya he ki ve artificial intelligence tul launch karne ja rahe hai
 Whose job will be to keep an eye on market fluctuations
 to kya dryver ke saath-saath share bazaar ke ustad bhi gaayab ho jaaenge
 Artificial intelligence easily captures the fine frauds of the stock market, which is also missed by the master there
 jab ye wal street main aa jayega to sochiye vahaan se bharat aate kitni der lagegi
 The speed of technology has increased and people too
 upi main sapa sarkaar ne smartphone kaa vaada kiya to lakhon logon ne website par jaakar registration kara diya
 In the coming days, all the governments from the center are releasing apps
 bahut se log is technology kii duniya se ab bhi baahar hai lekin bahut se log jisamen aam log bhi shaamil hai iske daayre main aate bhi ja rahe hai
 The comments agar aap ola yaa ubar car se chalate honge to aapke hi shahar kaa wo purana dryver ab raaston ko nahin jaanata he
 The way Google Map on a smartphone shows the way it moves
 jaise wo dilli kaa hokar dilli main nahin balki japan main car chalaa rahaa ho
 Today i realized that the driver has now given up the mental process of remembering the routes
 ek tarah se mashin par nirbhar hote hote aadmi bhi mashin ho rahaa he
 If there is no Google map and no smartphone, it is possible that many people are unable to reach their homes in the evening
 dhanteras kii bheed main ghoomte ghamate dilli se sonipat pahunch jaaen or vahaan apane ghar kaa pataa dhund rahe hon
 However, we will talk on Universal Basic Scheme
 naukariyaan nahin hongi ye chunauti to har daur kii rahi he lekin universal basic inakam dene kaa idia hi apane aap main kisi chunauti se kam nahin
 It is being talked about all over the world
 abhi kahin diya nahin ja rahaa he
 If we look at all the schemes, then the government gives help to a section of the citizens
 lekin universal basic inakam kuch alag jaan padataa he
 After reading a few articles, it means that this means that the government should give basic income from everyone to people below the poverty line to people like you
 maheene ke hisaab se ek tay raashi
 a referendum was held in June this year that the Constitution should be changed to give basic income to everyone unconditionally
 vahaan khub bahes hui, abhiyaan chalaa
 The government and Parliament protested that this would not make people work and one day they would not get workable people
 sweetrezaraland europe hi nahin duniya kaa behatar jivan str vaala desh he
 In such a country, 80 percent of the population has work, there was a debate about universal basic income that the government should give $ 2,524 to every citizen every month
 janamatsangrah main yah prastaav haar gaya
 The proposal was rejected by 77 percent of the vote
 europe ke kai deshon main is vichaar par bahes ho chuki he
 There are many political parties who are now giving it a place in their manifestos
 canada, finland or netherland bhi is par janamat sangrah karaane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 Right now in the atmosphere you will hear that the government should get rid of the notion of a public welfare state
 sarkaar kaa kaam he bijness yaa rojgaar kaa vaataavaran paidaa karnaa
 The subsidy share should be at least in the government's account, but if governments ever arrive at the policy that all eligible unqualified citizens will be given any amount like basic salary, then what will happen to the subsidy reduction arguments
 wo dhara itani majboot ho chuki he ki ab jab koi universal basic inakam kii baat karegaa to yahi lagegaa ki koi kyaali pilav pakaa rahaa he
 Someone will be an old-time communist, or a socialist
 poonjeevaad par chal chuki duniya main yah khyaal kaisaa ajeeb he
 But this idea only thrives in rich countries where the Communist Party has no basis
 america ke silicon vaili kii ek company he vaai combinetor
 It is a funding company
 isane california main basic inakam ko lekar payalat project shuru karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The company says that it wants to study how the basic income will be paid, how its data will be collected
 company ke president kaa kahana he ki jis tarah se technology ke kaaran naukariyaan ja rahi hai, ek din basic inakam lagu karnaa hi pad jayega
 There is a criticism that by this, the government will start giving money to the middle class except the poor
 nattejey main ho saktaa he ki garibi hi bad jaae
 Khair y Combinator will select 100 families from California
 chaahe wo naukari main ho yaa na ho
 Will give them 1000 to 2000 dollars every month
 dekhne ke liye ki unka jivan kaise badalata he
 You must also be thinking like me that if the government starts giving basic income to everyone, then no work will be done
 log aalsee ho jaaenge
 a few days ago Swaminathan Akleshwar Iyer has also written on this in Economic Times
 bijepi ke saansad varun gandhi ne is masale par likhaa he
 Sudipto Mandal, Emeritus Professor of National Institutes of Public Finance and Policy, has also written on The Wire News portal whether the time has come for the idea of universal Basic Income
 america kii ek rudhiwaadi think tanks sanstha he Cato Institute, vahaan ke vidwaan Michael Tanner and Matt Zwolinski kii daleel he ki america kaa jo maujuuda saamaajik suraksha system he wo bhayaavah he
 Its centers and states spend 1 billion dollars on this every year, despite this, 16 percent of America's population lives below the poverty line
 isliye maujuuda sabhi yojanaon ko band kar har america naagarik ko saal main 10,000 dollar milanaa chahie
 Provided he is 21 years of age
 kai logon ko lagata he ki is skim main jhanjhat kam he kyonki aap paatrata kii sharten nahin lagaate ki ise milegaa yaa ise nahin milegaa
 We often do not think about the condition of those who are not getting work
 bharat main manaregaa jaisi yojana he jo kam se kam 100 se 150 dinon ke liye rojgaar dene kii baat karti he
 In reality people may not get employment completely, but is this scheme not a short form of a scheme like Universal Basic Income
 duniya kii har sarkaar sabko kaam dene kii chunauti se jujh rahi he
 Recently we discussed in prime time that in 2015 only 1 lakh 35 thousand jobs were created in India
 2013 se 2015 ke bich baari giravat ai he
 Every day 550 jobs are being lost
 is saal ejineering campus main naukariyon main 20 pratishat kii giravat aa sakati he
 One third of the working population is useless
 68 fisadi kaamgaar pariwaron kii masik kamai 10,000 se adhik nahin he
 All these figures were printed in the reports of different newspapers
 vishwa bank ne bhi ek report jari kii he ki bharat main aane vaale dashakon main 69 fisadi naukariyaan robot ke kaaran khatm ho jaaengi
 Economists like Pranab Bardhan and Vijay Joshi have also advocated it
 inkaa maananaa he ki bharat main is yojana ko aazamaaya janaa chahie
 What will be its model, where will the money come from for this, these are all questions, but the current structure has entered our mind so much that the idea seems either useless or incomprehensible
 technology kii duniya tezi se badal rahi he
 You must have read in the colorful pages of newspapers that the technology of driving a car and a bus without a driver is being developed
 yah trial apane antim charan main he
 On the one hand, Ola and Uber have produced millions of new drivers in India, on the other hand how much we believe on these trials that they will soon eliminate the community of millions of drivers
 vaise ham bina gear or klach vaali automatic car chalaane bhi lage hai
 Another technical experiment is that of artificial intelligence
 isse mashin aadmi ko shatranj ke khel main haraa detii he
 Two exchange operators in Wall Street, USA, have announced that they are going to launch an artificial intelligence tool
 jiskaa kaam hoga bazaar ke utaar chadhaav par nazar rakhana
 So, along with the driver, will the masters of the stock market also vanish
 artificial intelligence share bazaar kii baarik dhokhadhadiyon ko aasaani se pakad letaa he jise pakadaney main vahaan ke ustad se bhi chook ho jaati he
 When it comes to Wall Street, think how long it will take to come to India from there
 technology kii raftaar tej ho gai he or log bhi
 If the SP government promised a smartphone in UP, millions of people went to the website and registered it
 aae din centre se lekar tamaam sarkarein ap jari kar rahi hai
 Many people are still outside the world of this technology, but many people, including ordinary people, are also coming under its purview
 tippaniyan If you will be driving by Ola or Uber car, then that old driver of your city does not know the routes now
 smartphone par google map jaise jaise rasta bataata he vaise vaise wo chalata he
 Like he is driving a car in Delhi but not in Delhi but in Japan
 aaj hi maine anubhav kiya ki dryver ne ab raaston ko yaad karne kii maansik prakriya ko chhod diya he
 In a way, depending on the machine, man is also becoming a machine
 agar google map na ho or smartphone na ho to mumkin he ki bahut se log shaam ko apane ghar hi na pahunch paaen
 While wandering in the crowd of Dhanteras, reach Sonipat from Delhi and find your home address there
 baharhaal universal basic skim par baat karenge
 Jobs will not be a challenge, it has been an all-time challenge, but the idea of giving universal basic income is not less than a challenge in itself
 isi saal june main is baat ko lekar janamat sangrah hua ki bina shart sabhi ko basic inakam dene ke liye samvidhan main badlaav karnaa chahie
 There was a lot of debate, campaigning took place
 sarkaar or sansad ne virodh kiya ki isse to log kaam nahin karenge or ek din kaam laayak log nahin milenge
 Switzerland is not only a country with a better standard of living in Europe
 80 fisadi aabaadi ke paas kaam he, aise desh main universal basic inakam ko lekar bahes hui ki sabhi naagarik ko har maheene sarkaar 2,524 dollar de
 This motion was defeated in the referendum
 77 fisadi vot se yah prastaav riject ho gaya
 The idea has been debated in many countries of Europe
 kai raajnneetik dal hai jo ab ise apane ghoshnapatron main jagah dene lage hai
 Canada, Finland and the Netherlands are also considering holding a referendum on it
 abhi apane aap se maahaul main aap yahi sunate honge ki sarkaar ko lok kalyankari rajya kii dharna se mukti paa leni chahie
 The government's job is to create an environment of business or employment
 sarkaar ke khate main sabsidi kaa hissaa kam se kam hona chahie lekin agar sarkarein kabhi is niti par pahunchati hai ki sabhi yogya ayogy nagarikon ko basic selary jaisi koi raashi di jaaegi to phir sabsidi kam karne vaale tarkon kaa kya hoga
 That stream has become so strong that now when someone talks about universal basic income, then it will feel that someone is cooking an empty casserole
 koi puraane jamaane kaa communist hoga, yaa phir socialist
 How strange is this idea in the world that has gone on capitalism
 magar yah khyaal panpa hi he amir deshon main jahaan communist party kaa koi aadhaar tak nahin he
 y Combinator is a company in Silicon Valley, USA
 ye funding company he
 It has announced to start a pilot project on basic income in California
 company kaa kahana he ki wo is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chaahati he ki basic inakam kaa bhugtan kaise hoga, iskaa data kaise jamaa hoga
 The president of the company says that due to the way technology is leaving jobs, one day basic income will have to be implemented
 ek aalochana he ki isse to sarkaar garibon ko chhod middle class ko paisa dene lagegi
 As a result, poverty may only increase
 kair vaai combinetor california ke sau pariwaron kaa chayan karegi
 Whether it is in a job or not
 unhen har maheene 1000 se 2000 dollar degi
 To see how their life changes
 aap bhi meri tarah soch rahe honge ki agar sarkaar sabhi ko basic inakam dene lage to koi kaam hi nahin karegaa
 People will become lazy
 iconomic times main kuch din pehle swaminathan akleshwar ayyar ne bhi is par likhaa he
 BJP MP Varun Gandhi has written on this issue
 National Institue Of Public Finance and Policy ke emiratus professor sudipto mandal ne bhi di vir news portal par likhaa he ki kya universal basic inakam ke vichaar kaa samay aa gaya he
 The Cato Institute, an orthodox think tank organization in the United States, argues that the current social security system of America is horrifying, by scholars Michael Tanner and Matt Zwolinski
 vahaan ke centre or rajya har saal 1 arab dollar is par kharch karte hai iske baavjood america kii 16 fisadi aabaadi garibi rekha se neeche rahati he
 Therefore, every American citizen should get $ 10,000 a year by closing all existing plans
 basharte uski umr 21 saal kii ho
 Many people feel that the problem in this scheme is less because you do not put the eligibility conditions whether it will be received or not
 ham aksar ye nahin sochate ki jinhen kaam nahin mil rahaa he unki haalat kya hoti he
 There is a scheme like MNREGA in India which talks about giving employment for at least 100 to 150 days
 hakeekat main bhale puri tarah se logon ko rojgaar na miltaa ho lekin kya ye skim universal basic inakam jaisi yojana kaa chota rup nahin he
 Every government in the world is facing the challenge of giving work to all
 haal hi main hamane prime time main is par charchaa kii thi ki bharat main 2015 main sirf 1 lakh 35 hazaar naukariyon kaa hi srijan hua
 There has been a steep decline between 2013 and 2015
 har din 550 naukariyaan khatm hoti ja rahi hai
 This year, there may be a 20 percent drop in jobs on engineering campuses
 kaam kar sakane vaali aabaadi kaa ek tihaai bekaar he
 68 percent of working families do not have a monthly earning of more than 10,000
 ye saare aankade alag alag akhbaaron kii report main chape the
 The World Bank has also released a report that in the coming decades, 69 percent of jobs in India will be lost due to robots
 pranab bardhan or vijay joshi jaise arthshaastriyon ne bhi isaki vakaalat kii he
 They believe that this scheme should be tried in India
 iske model kya honge, iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega, ye sab sawaal to hai lekin hamaare dimaag main maujuuda dhaancha is kadar ghus gaya he ki yah vichaar yaa to bekaar lagata he yaa phir samaj se baahar
 The world of technology is changing rapidly
 aap aae din akhabaaron ke rangeen pannon main padhate honge ki bina dryver ke car or bas chalaane kii technology viksit kii ja rahi he
 This trial is in its final stages
 ek taraf bharat main hi ola or ubar ne lakhon nae dryver paidaa kar diye, duusari taraf ham in trial par kitna yakeen karen ki ye jaldi hi lakhon driver kii birdari ko hi khatm kar denge
 By the way, we have also started running automatic cars with no gear and clutch
 ek or takniki prayog he artificial intelligence kaa
 This makes the machine beat the man in a game of chess
 america ke wal street main do exange oparator ne elaan kiya he ki ve artificial intelligence tul launch karne ja rahe hai
 Whose job will be to keep an eye on market fluctuations

 Artificial intelligence easily captures the fine frauds of the stock market, which is also missed by the master there

 The Delhi government started distributing certificates of subsidy to e-rickshaw drivers at Indira Gandhi Stadium
 is dauraan shanivaar ko 6 hajaar i-rickshaw chaalkon ko sabsidi di gai, jisamen har chaalak ko 30 hajaar rupee die jaaenge
 The Kejriwal government claimed during the program that e-rickshaws have reduced pollution levels in Delhi

 'sisodia advised e-rickshaw drivers not to get caught in the private school, as there are now adequate arrangements in the government school
 vahiin bheed dekhakar siem arvind kejariwal ne bhi vaahvahee luutane kaa koi mauka nahi choda
 Kejriwal first asked the e-rickshaw drivers whether they were happy with the subsidy
 Hearing the slogans of the drivers in response, Kejriwal again said, 'seeing your happiness, my one kilo of blood has increased
 'siem kejariwal ne chaalkon se apil kii he ki ve 22 july tak bank account number, license or cancil check parivahan vibhaag main jamaa kar den, taaki baaki logon ko bhi 31 july tak sabsidi mil sake
 Kejriwal also said, 'if there is a congestion in the transport department, then e-rickshaw drivers can submit paper to the MLA
 saare vidhayakon kii duty laga di jaaegi
 Apart from this, after 31 July, as the paper keeps coming, subsidy will continue to be available
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki zyada se zyada vaahan, bijli yaa bydaree se chalanaa chahie

 As the countdown to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections begins, the Congress is trying to convince the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh that no matter how much the Samajwadi Party becomes a Muslim supporter, its influence is not outside the state
 agar puure desh main koi party alpsankhyakon kii himaayat kar sakati he to vah he congress
 To show his new style, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi announced 31 district heads in the state, the maximum 13 of them were elected from the Muslim society
 isamen bhi badi sankhya pichde musalamaanon kii he
 The list includes only four Dalit names
 isse pataa chalata he ki jamini hakeekat se takaraakar rahul kii dalit kendrit rajnatik vichaardhaara ek aprihaary mode lene ko majaboor he
 In fact, Rahul's strategists understand that the love of Dalit can be very good in its place, but in Uttar Pradesh, the party has no shoulder that can take this voter down from Mayawati's elephant
 udhar musalmaan aisa voter he, jisane loksabhaa chunaav-2009 main sapa ko jhtka dekar congress ko 21 siten dilaai thi
 In the assembly elections-2012, this voter went to the SP and only 28 mlas of the Congress could win
 lekin ab jab sapa sarkaar ko ek saal se upar ho gaya he or centre kii ladaai upie banaam endie he, tab congress ke paas yah sochane kii har vajah maujuud he ki muslim voter uske paale main aa saktaa he
 SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary hurts this thinking, "congress is copying us in the case of district heads
" lekin muslim samaaj ko pataa he ki 1990 se netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) unke saath khadey hai
 Congress is not going to get anything
 ’’vaise, congress ko pataa he ki agar kuch milanaa he to yaheen se milanaa he
 Party state president Nirmal Khatri says, "this is not an imitation of SP, it is an old Congress policy
" nayaa yah he ki is baar pichde tabake ke musalamaanon ko zyada netritv diya ja rahaa he
 "it is not that the party is only giving preference to Muslims in the organization
" iske saath hi aam musalmaan se judye kii jugat bhi jari he
 Recently the Minister of Minority Affairs at the Center
 rahamaan khan jab lakhanu pahunche to mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se unke ghar jaakar mili
 After this, in a joint press conference, he said, "the Union government wants to work with the state government for the welfare of minority
" ’’ is par mukhyamantri ne jod diya ki pichhali rajya sarkaar ke kaarykaal main alpsankhyak kalyaan yojanaon kaa kaam kaaphi pichad gaya he
 And right here sp's Muslim leader Azam Khan shot an arrow, "muslim reservation is the basic spirit of the Sachar Committee recommendations
 ’’ gend congress ke paale main dhakelte hue ajam khan ne kaha, ‘‘upie sarkaar sansad main muslim aarakshan kaa prastaav lekar aae to sapa uskaa puraa samarthan karegi
 This will reveal who is in favor of reservation and who is against
 ’’ jab sapa ne muslim mudde par baaji maarane kii koshish kii to rahamaan khan ne ek kadam aage badhkar kaha, ‘‘badakismati se musalamaanon ko hameshaa ek dharmik samooh samaj gaya na ki saamaajik samooh
 Without naming the BJP, he said that some people want to give religious color to the demand for Muslim reservation
 ek-duusare se hode lagaate ye samvaad congress or sapa kii chunavi morchebandi kii baangi bhar hai
 The horizon of preparing for the Congress is wider this time
 is ghatnakram se pehle rahamaan khan ne lakhanu ke congress daftar main 200 se zyada muslim netaaon ko centre kii alpsankhyak kalyaan yojanaon kaa paath padhaayaa
 The Congress is spoiling that the Center is giving money to the minorities, but the credit is being looted by the SP
 paath khatm hone ke turant baad ve daarul ulum nadwa pahunchakar ol india muslim personal lau board ke adhyaksh moulana rabe hasani nadvi se mukhaatib hue
 This was followed by a meeting with the Imam of Aishbagh Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali and Shia religious teacher Maulana Kalbe Jawwad
 in muslim netaaon ko rahamaan ne kendriya yojanaon kii jaankaree to di hi unase is masale main ‘‘feedback’’ bhi liya
 This was the first time since the formation of a separate Ministry of Minority Affairs at the Center in the year 2006, when one of its ministers reached the state headquarters to inform the Congress workers of the state about the schemes
 kya congress vaaki sapa kii nakal karne ke chakkar main dalit agenda peeche chhod rahi he? faijabad jaise sampradayik rup se samvedansheel seat se saansad khatri kii daleel he, ‘‘dalit netaaon ko lagaataar aage laayaa ja rahaa he, chunki ve nirnaayak padon par pehle se hi kam hai, aise main sankhya badhaane main thodaa vakt lagegaa
 "actually, Congress is confused
 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad pehle to party ne pradesh adhyaksh badla
 After that, after careful consideration, he created eight zonal coordinators
 is tarah ke pad bispi kii khaasiyat rahi he
 After giving this responsibility to the Union Ministers and mps, when it was expected that the Congress would move forward, that system was scrapped after seven months
 muslim maamalon ke jaankaar or lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main persian vibhaag ke purv adhyaksh pro
 Khan Atif says, "congress has this golden opportunity to make inroads among Muslims
" kunda main sio kii hatya or phir police hiraasat main khalid mujahid kii maut ke baad musalamaanon main pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi he
 On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has put ghee in the fire by making Amit Shah, a close aide of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 ’’pradesh main 18
 In order to capitalize on this discontent among the 5 per cent Muslims, the Congress commanded the zone one of the western districts - fast-paced youth leader and MLA Pankaj Malik and the command of zone eight Dr
 mohammad muslim ko saunpi he
 By making MLA Dilanwaj in the second zone and Aslam Raini the fourth zone, the party has played a stake in creating a "connection" among the Muslims at the local level
 ambedkarnagar jile main bunakaron kii khaasi aabaadi or yahaan ke dharmik sthal kichocha (dargah) sharif se musalamaanon ke judaav ke dekhte hue congress ne saiyad merajuddin kichhauhavi ko jila adhyaksh banaaya he
 His nephews are Sajjadanshi of Kichouchha Sharif
 khaas baat yah he ki congress kaa sabase zyada dhyaan pichde musalamaanon ko party se jodgaye par he
 That is why the party has given prominence to the backward Muslims in the organization
 bulandshahr main nafe ansaari ko shahar adhyaksh banaaya gaya he to shamali main muslim gurjar birdari se aane vaale ayyub jang ko jila adhyaksh or mujffarnagar main tarik kuraishi ko shahar adhyaksh kii kaman saunpi gai he
 Rahul Gandhi may have now started trying to become an advocate of Muslims in UP, but many questions are open in front of him
 aakhir loksabhaa chunaav ke aate hi congress ko musalamaanon kii yaad kyon ai? rahul us samay kahaan the jab upi main sapa sarkaar banane kebaad sampradayik dangon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya tha? loksabhaa chunaav main musalamaanon kaa vot paane ke liye rahul ko is samudaay ke bich tair rahe in sawaalon ke jawaab talashne honge

 71 years of independence of the country have passed
 in 71 saalon main desh ke musalamaanon ne kai utaar-chadhaav bhare daur dekhen or kai chunautiyon kaa saamana bhi kiya he
 Despite this, the flame of hope of a better life was always burning within the Muslims and the dream has been cherished in their eyes
 aazaadee ke itane arase baad aaj desh kaa musalmaan kahaan or kis haalat main khadaa he
 Aajtak on this issue
 in ne desh ke tamaam muslim buddhijiviyon se baatcheet kii
 Mohammad Sajjad, Professor of the Aligarh Muslim University History Department, on the Tehzeeb of the country, says that Muslims have been partners in every form from the country's independence to cultural and social
 iske peeche kii vajah desh main dharmanirpekshata or milijuli tahjeeb par unka bharosa he
 The constitution was also made under the same practice, in which all society was equaled
 pichley kuch saalon main dakshinpanthi takaton kaa prabhaav badhane se desh kii is viraasat par bhi khatre bade hai
 In these 71 years, along with improving the economic conditions of Muslims, their representation in Panchayat Raj has also increased
 jo duusare samaaj main musalamaanon ke prati irshyaa kii vajah bani, iske jariye dakshinpanthi takaton ko apana pair pasaarne kaa mauka mila
 But i hope that right wing forces will not be able to stay in India for very long
 roodhiwaadee soch chhod progressive bane musalmanprofessor mohammad sajaad kehete hai- musalamaanon ke saamne bahut najuk daur he, aise main use aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 One has to rise above conservative thinking and come forward with progressive thinking
 itnaa hi nahin ek aam naagarik kii tarah khamoshi se apni pasand kii party ko vot karen, lekin sawaal sabhi partiyon se karen, keval bijepi se hi nahin
 Apart from this, the Muslims of the country should raise their issues together with the rest of the society of the country
 shahbaanon jaise rudhiwaadi mudde par ekajute hone ke bajaae thos aarthik muddon par ekajute hon
 Stand on par with the problems of farmers, issues of development and the fight for social justice
 khatre main dharmik aazaadeemoulana salmaan nadvi kehete hai ki aazaadee ke 71 saal ke baad bhi desh ke musalamaanon ko apni rashtrabhakti kaa saboot dena padataa he
 Whereas Muslims have made the most sacrifices in the independence of the country
 iske baavjood hamaari vafadari par shaq kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In the current era, religious freedom of Muslims is being targeted, sometimes three divorces, sometimes through common civil code
 itnaa hi nahin madrason ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The spirits of communal forces are so high that Muslims are being killed publicly
 desh kaa saamaajik tanabana bighad chukaa he
 In such a situation, freedom is no longer important
 musalamaanon kaa nuksaan modi se zyada nehru ne kiyapurv saansad eliyas aazmi kehete hai- musalamaanon kii jindagi ko jitna nuksaan jawahar laal nehru ne 1947 se 1964 ke bich main pahunchaaya he, utana to narendra modi pachaas saal main bhi nahin pahunchaa sakate
 During Nehru's time, the condition of Muslims had deteriorated so much that four Muslims could not stand together and talk
 muslim kaum puri tarah ehsaas-e-kamatari kaa shikaar ho chuki thi
 The participation of Muslims in jobs, education and politics was completely abolished
 nehru kii is sajeesh main jamiyat ulma-e-hind ke adhyaksh rahe moulana hossain ahamed madani bhi shaamil rahe
 In the era of Nehru and Indira, the curtains and the dirty streets of Tat were the hallmarks of Muslim settlements
 musalamaanon kaa golden periodilias aazmi kehete hai ki musalamaanon ke khoe hue aatmavishvaas ko waapas laane main dow
 Faridi has played an important role
 muslim majalish ke jariye unhone musalamaanon ke andar se ehsaas-e-kamatari ko khatm kiya
 The highest golden period for Muslims was from 1977 to 2009 in the 71 years of independence
 isi dauraan desh ke saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik sabhi kshetron main musalamaanon kii hissedari badi or vikaas kii disha main behatar kadam uthaae gaye
 The Muslims of the country stood with the rest of the society, after 2009 an atmosphere has been created against the Muslims
 vartmaan main modi kii sarkaar he, kuch chijen jarur musalamaanon ke khilaaf ho rahi hai, lekin nehru ke daur kii tarah musalamaanon ko haashie par nahin dhakela ja saktaa, kyonki ab 1947 ke daur vaala musalmaan nahin he
 Today's Muslim is ready to die
 apane haq kii ladaai main peeche nahin hatega
 The threat to the freedom of democracy, Professor Imtiaz Ahmed says that at the time of independence of the country, which was the meaning and concept of independence
 aaj kii paristhiti main us par khatra mandara rahaa he
 Unity diversity, which is our social specialty, is being taken back
 nateeja ye he ki hamaare freedom ke saath-saath desh kii loktantric vyavastha par bhi khatra he
 Whether the freedom gained in 1947 will survive or not
 asuraksha kii bhaavana main ji rahaa musalmaandesh kii aazaadee ke 71 saal main musalamaanon ne jo tarakkee kii he
 It has not been through the government level, but unfortunately it has been given by the market forces
 musalmaan baazaaroo sambhaavnaaon kaa phayda uthaakar pragatisheel or madhyavarg ke baraabar khadaa hua he
 But he has also suffered property attacks through communal riots
 pichley do-teen saalon main paristhitiyaan kaaphi najuk hui hai
 As a minority, the security that Muslims should have got, unfortunately that protection has come down
 unhen lagata he ki aazaadee ke samay samvidhan ke jariye unhen jo aazaadee mili thi wo bachegi bhi yaa nahin
 The Muslim is living in a sense of insecurity
 aaj hindutvvaadi soch or state ke andar taanaashaahee pravriti aa rahi he, uski dein he ki gaurakshak logon ko saream maar rahe hai
 It is now difficult to breathe in the freedom that was attained 71 years ago
 musalamaanon main tarakkee-khushhalipurv rajyasabha sadsy va patrkaar shahid siddiki kehete hai ki 71 saal main desh kaa musalmaan aage badha he or jindagi ke har kshetra main tarakkee kar rahaa he
 With the belief that his future is safe in the country
 bangladesh banane ke baad desh kaa musalmaan ird-gird dekhnaa band kar apane bhavishya ko savanrane ke liye menstream kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 Of course there are many problems and challenges today, but in the changing environment, the new breed of Muslims wants to change their thinking and work, that is the reason why today in the world, Muslims are facing the worst condition
 bharat main na to vah kisi kattarwadi soch se judaa he or na hi kisi aatankwaadi raste par he
 He is looking for new avenues and a new world by relying solely on the Constitution of India
 maujuuda daur main jo chunautiyaan hai unase ladane ke liye do hi raste hai, pehla shiksha or doosraa aarthik rup se sabal hona
 By following these two paths, a Muslim can remove the darkness and disperse the light
 srilanka ke purv raashtrapatimahinda rajpakshene shuukravaar shaam raashtrapati sachivalay main naepradhanmantrike rup main shapath lee
 President Maithripala Sirisena has replaced Neranil Wickremesinghe and made former President Mahinda Rajapaksa the new Prime Minister
 haalanki ranil vikramsinghe kaa kahana he ki wo ab bhi srilanka ke pradhanmantri bane hue hai
 How will relations with India The question of how Sri Lanka's relations with India will remain after Rajapaksa becomes Prime Minister has become a vocal one
 srilanka bharat kaa sabase kareebi padosi rahaa he, isliye vahaan kii choti ghatana bhi bharat ke liye myne rakhti he
 However, on Friday, India made it clear that who becomes the Prime Minister in Sri Lanka is an internal matter
 srilanka kii haal kii do ghatnaayen bhartiya sandarbh main kaaphi ahm maani ja rahi hai
 a few days ago, a clash took place during a cabinet meeting between President Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe
 sutron ke hawaale se colombo sthit daily mirar akhbaar ne daawa kiya tha ki raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ke bich vivaad kii sthiti colombo port par east container terminal ko bhartiya nivesh se banane par bani thi
 The China Cabinet meeting between India and Sri Lanka was proposed by the Sri Lankan Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe to the Cabinet to give responsibility for developing the East Container Coast to the Sri Lanka Port Authority
 vahiin, cabinet baithak ke dauraan srilanka ke deveopment stretage or international trade ministar malik samaarawikrama ne bhartiya nivesh se port banane kaa paksh rakhaa tha
 a dispute between the president and the prime minister arose when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe advocated accepting the trade minister's proposal
 isamen gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki cabinet baithak se pehle srilanka ke raashtrapati ne ek chini company ko hambantota port lij par die jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 Now when Rajapaksa has sat on the post of Prime Minister, india-sri Lanka relations have begun to investigate how the relationship between the two countries will be in Sri Lanka's perspective
 yahaan jaan lenaa jaruri he ki isse pehle rajpakshe srilanka kii satta se hataae gaye the, to uske peeche bhi ahm kaaran hambantota port china ko lij par die jane kaa prastaav tha
 What will happen to Hambantota in 2015, India played a role of 'elder brother', reconciled between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa was shown the way out
 maamla hambantota port kaa hi tha kyonki rajpakshe ne china ko isaki ijaajat dete hue colombo port banane par hari jhandi dikhaai thi
 Then it was also decided that Chinese submarine ships would camp in Sri Lankan waters
 haalanki baad main rajpakshe srilanka kii satta se baahar ho gaye
 Today when Rajapaksa is made Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, questions are arising as to what will happen to Hambantota and China
 in sabase pehle ek or ghatana kaaphi myne rakhti he jisamen raashtrapati sirisena ne bharat kii khufia agency ro par hatya kii sajeesh rachane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 However, later, he snapped the entire part of it by breaking the forehead of the media
 iske kuch din baad hi srilanka main purvi terminal pariyojna sahit bharat samarthit pariyojnaon main teji laane ke liye piem modi se baatcheet ke liye ranil vikramsinghe dilli aae
 The complete details of what the talks were, could not be found, but the removal of Wickremesinghe on Friday and making Rajapaksa the Prime Minister is considered a matter of concern for India
 rajpakshe kya bharat ke samarthan main?haalanki media reporton main rajpakshe or bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kii un do mulakaaton ko bhi pramukhataa se jagah di ja rahi he jisamen piem modi ne samay nikaalkar apane srilankai daure ke dauraan rajpakshe se mulaakaat kii
 Rajapaksa also came to India and met PM Modi
 isse bhi badi baat yah he ki bharat aane se pehle rajpakshe ne purv videsh mantri or apni party ke pravaktaa jiel paris ko bharat bheja or donon deshon ke bich sambandhon ko pragadh banane par jor diya
 Among all these, apart from ECT, there are many more projects that India is going to undertake there, such as Trincomalee Oil Tank Farms, Palali Airport in Jaffna, Mattala Airport in Hambantota and LNG Terminal near Colombo
 abhi haal main bhartiya compiyanon ko vahaan houseing project kaa theka mila he, jo pehle chini companiyon ke paas tha
 These are some of the changes that will determine the strategic relationship between India and Sri Lanka as many of India's strategic interests are at stake in Sri Lanka

 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will deliver its verdict today (on Thursday) on India's appeal against the death sentence awarded to Kulbhushan Jadhav in Pakistan
 sarkari sutron ke anusaar antarrashtriya adaalat aaj bhartiya samyaanusaar dopaher kareeb 3:30 baje apana faisla sunayegi
 In fact, in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, there was a strong debate between India and Pakistan in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) here on Monday
 bharat ne jadhav kii maut kii sajaa fouran sthagit karne kii maang kii, jabaki pakistan ne bharat par ‘mithyaa vichaar’ vaali ek arji ke jariye is vaishvik sanstha kaa ‘raajnneetik manch’ ke rup main istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 It is noteworthy that India has taken Jadhav's case to the International Court of Justice and accused Pakistan of violating the Vienna Agreement and of absurd prosecution for convicting Jadhav without having little evidence
 donon padosi deshon kaa 18 saal pehle yahaan aamanaa-saamana hua tha, jab pakistan ne apni nausena ke vimaan ko maar giraane ke maamle main isse hastkshep kii maang kii thi
 After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the court said that it would issue its order as soon as possible on India's request for a temporary measure
 nyaayalay ne kaha, 'saarvajanik baithak main jis taarikh ko aadesh jari kiya jayega, us bare main donon pakshon ko soochna de di jaaegi'
 India has demanded immediate adjournment of Jadhav's death sentence, fearing that Pakistan may hang him before the ICJ hearing is completed
 nausena ke 46 varshiya purv adhikari ke maamle main isije ke sunwaayee shuru karne par bharat ne joardaar daleel pesh kii
 Jadhav was arrested on March 3 last year and sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court for his alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities
 tippaniyan Deepak Mittal, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, told the ICJ in his opening remarks, "jadhav was not empowered to get appropriate legal aid and diplomatic help
" faisla hone se pehle hi unhen faansee die jane kaa ek fori khatra mandara rahaa he'
 Chief Counsel Harish Salve, representing India, said that the death sentence cannot be executed when this Court is hearing an appeal
 nahin to, yah vienna samjhauta kaa ulanghan hoga
 After India's arguments, Pakistan had said in its plea in the highest judicial body of the United Nations that India's application on Jadhav is irresponsible and misinterpreted and must be rejected
 darasal, kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main beete somvaar ko yahaan antarrashtriya nyaayalay (isije) main bharat or pakistan ke bich joardaar bahes hui thi
 India demanded an immediate adjournment of Jadhav's death sentence, while Pakistan accused India of using this global institution as a 'political platform' through an application of 'false views'
 ullekhneey he ki bharat jadhav ke maamle ko antarashtriya nyaayalay main le gaya he or pakistan par vienna samjhauta kaa ulanghan karne tathaa leshmaatr saboot ke bagaiyr jadhav ko doshi tehraane ke liye betuka mukadmaa chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya he

 The court said, "the date on which the order will be issued in the public meeting will be informed to both the parties"
 bharat ne jadhav kii maut kii sajaa ko fouran sthagit karne kii maang karte hue ashanka jataai he ki pakistan isije main sunwaayee puri hone se pehle hi unhen faansee de saktaa he
 India strongly argued the ICJ hearing in the 46-year-old former Navy officer
 jadhav ko pichley saal teen march ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha or pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne kathith jasusi evam vidhvansak gatividhiyon main sanlipt rahane ke aarope main unhen maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 The comments videsh mantralay main sanyukt sachiv deepak mittal ne apni shuruuaati tippanee main isije se kaha, 'jadhav ko upyukt kanoonee sahaayta or rajanyik madad paane kaa adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 There is an immediate danger of being hanged even before the decision is taken
 bharat kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe mukhya vakil harish salve ne kaha ki aise main jab yah nyaayalay apil par sunwaayee kar rahaa he, maut kii sajaa kaa kriyanvan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Otherwise, it would be a violation of the Vienna Agreement
 bharat kii daleel ke baad pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra kii sarvocch nyaayik sanstha main apni daleel main kaha tha ki jadhav par bharat kii arji gairajaruri or galat tareeke se vyakhya vaali he tathaa ise avashya khaarij kiya janaa chahie

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)march 25, 2019hindi samet kai bhashaaon main relies hui captain maarval ke bhi bharat main badhiya kaarobaar karne kii khabaren hai
 Overall March has proved to be quite good so far
 is shuukravaar notebook or junglee relies hogi
 May be the end of March with another hit
 is samay team india ko 'talash' he
 This search is necessary, because nothing, much of this team has been lost
 kahaan kho gaya hai, kyon kho gaya he or kaise hogi un sabaki talash, ye bada sawaal he
 This quest will have to start with team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 dhoni ahmedabad tak to sabake saamne the, lekin mumbai test ke baad kho gaye hai
 His personality, his captaincy are not found
 ahmedabad main haar kaa jhatka bada jarur he, lekin hakeekat yah bhi he ki team series main sirf ek test hi haari he
 Now it's time to hit back
 palatwaar ke liye sabase badi jimmedaari he captain dhoni ke kandhon par
 He has the responsibility of keeping the team united
 dressing room ko baandhakar rakhane kii jimmedaari he, apni galatiyon ko sudhaarney kii jimmedaari he, team kaa hausala badhaane kii jimmedaari he or aakhir main team ko jeet dilaane kii jimmedaari he
 Kolkata Test is going to be a milestone in Dhoni's career, so this quest has to be finished before Kolkata
 kyonki ek captain kaa asli cheharaa kamyaabi main nahin, haar main dikhataa he or yaheen dhoni ko dikhaanaa hoga ki wo kis mitti ke bane hai
 They have to prove
 unhen dikhaanaa hoga ki wo faisle nahin, kade faisle lete hai
 They will have to show that if there is a fightback then Dhoni will be at the forefront of this response
 darasal team india ko us dhoni kii talash he jo palak jhapakate match kaa rukh badal detaa tha, jiskaa doosraa naam karishma tha, jo jaadugar hi nahin
 
 
 
 khud jaadu tha
 Which made India champions in T20 and odis
 maahi mumbai main haare jarur ho sakate hai, lekin unke saath puri team kandhe se kandhaa milaae khadi he
 The fans of Indian cricket want to find everything that makes them happy and win Team India
 lekin ye talash itani aasaan nahin he
 The car has derailed and the circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the team to come back
 sach to ye he ki khilaadiyon ko apana kirdaar nahin pataa he or team management puri tarah bikhar chukaa haih captain pehle apni pasand kii pich maangate hai or jeet naa milane par aalochana karte hai
 
 
 
 or to or terning wicket par bhartiya spinners kamyaabi kaa koi rasta tak nahin talash pate or captain ko ye tak nahin pataa hota ki kis gendbaaj ko morche par kab lagaana he
 Indian team has two such openers, which have proved many times that the pitch and conditions do not matter to them
 lekin, mumbai test kii pehali pari main 4 or duusari pari main 30 ran kii opening saajhedaari hui
 In such a situation the foundation of batting was shaken
 vakt ek baar phir khud ko sabit karne kaa he
 If both of them did not overcome the difficulties of Team India at this time, then why is such a big stature? Not strong
 Can
 duusari pari main bhartiya team kaa score tha ek wicket ke nuksaan par 37 ran, lekin pujaara ke jate hi halaat itane bighad gaye ki team kaa score ja pahunchaa 6 wicket par 92
 Now there is a need to strengthen the middle order too strongly
 aisa nahin ki kamyaabi kii talash puri ho nahin sakati
 If there is strength, the search will also be complete
 jarurat he to sirf basics par lautne kii
 The Indian men's basketball team crashed out of the 17th Asian Games on Wednesday, losing their second consecutive match in group-e against Iran
 iran ne bharat ko 76-41 se haraaya
 The Indian team, which topped their group in the qualifier round, also lost to the Philippines on Tuesday in their first match

 tamil ko aadhikarik bhashaa banane kii maangabijepi netaa bole- diemke ne aisa kyon nahin kiyadiemke chif stallin ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se tamil ko bharat kii aadhikarik bhashaa karne kii maang kii he
 Stalin said that as the PM himself admits that Tamil is the oldest language in the world, it is the responsibility of the Center to recognize the language
 unhone madras ucch nyaayalay main tamil ko prashasnic bhashaa ke rup main banaae jane kii bhi apil kii
 Stalin demanded PM Modi to take all necessary steps and take pride in making Tamil the official language of the nation
 unhone kaha ki hamen yah dekhakar khushi ho rahi he ki modi vibhinn manchon par tamil bhashaa kii prashansa kar rahe hai
 He said that Tamil is already the official language of many countries
 isapar main piem kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chaahunga
 We Tamil people have high expectations from PM Modi
 tamil bhashaa ke prati jis tarah kaa sneh vah dikhaate hai ummid he ki vah jald hi vyaavhaarik ho jayega
 On Monday, PM Modi also recalled the speech given to the United Nations in Chennai, in which he said that Tamil is one of the oldest languages in the world
 unke is bayaan ke baad america main ye charchaa kaa vishay ho gaya tha
 On the statement of Stalin, bjp's Narayan Tirupati said what the DMK was doing from 1 year 1996 to 2005
 unhone kyon nahin kadam uthaae
 The court can decide on making Tamil an official language
 dilli main nigam chunaav ko lekar sargharmiyaan tej ho gai
 The Delhi Election Commission met all the parties including the leaders of Aam Aadmi Party, Congress, BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party regarding delimitation
 darasal parisemen ko lekar congress or bijepi ne aapattiyaan jaahir kii thi jisko lekar chunaav ayog ne meeting ke liye sari partiyon ko bulaayaa
 In this, the selection of wards for the population and the announcement on the SC seats were considered soon, because the BJP and Congress believed that there was not much time left for the elections, so it should be decided soon
 bijepi or congress ne kai muddon ko lekar apni samasya bataai
 Where both Congress and BJP parties raised the issue of ward population
 unka kahana tha ki kisi ward kii jansankhya 8 xxrep 4 0 se zyada he to kisi main 5 xxrep 4 0 se neeche, jabaki chunaav ayog ne 6 xxrep 4 0 kii jansankhya ko lekar ward banane kii baat kahi thi
 At the same time, BJP and Congress had different notes about the SC seat
 congress kii maang he ki har vidhansabha seat main ek ward essi ke liye hona chahie to bijepi chaahati he ki essi jansankhya ke aadhaar par essi seat tay ho, yani agar ek vidhansabha ke chaar vaardon main se 3 main bhi essi jansankhya zyada hoga to teenon siton ko essi seat bana dena chahie
 But all parties were looking at the issue of holding elections on time
 darasal, teenon nigamo main bijepi kaa kabza he, agar jansankhya ke aadhaar essi seat tay hoti he to bijepi ko zyada samasya nahin hogi, lekin agar ek vidhansabha main ek essi seat tay hoti he to phir bijepi main tikaton ke liye maaramaari machana tay hoga jisase bijepi bachanaa chaahati he
 However, the Election Commission will take a decision on this
 rashtriya lok samta party ke netaa upendra kushavaah ne kaha he ki lalu yadav parivaar par jo aarope lage hai agenciyaan unki jaanch kar rahi hai
 Whatever will be the factor, it will come to the fore
 lekin jo nitish kumaar naitikta kaa paath sabko padhate the, ab apane upar usko lagu karke dikhaaen
 He said, 'nitish Kumar has asked Lalu Yadav to answer the allegations of facts and explain to Laluji Nitish Kumar
 sawaal ye nahin he ki lalu yadav kya kah rahe hai
 The question is whether Nitish Kumar agrees with Lalu Yadav's cleanliness because he has asked Lalu Yadav to answer with facts
 bihar or desh kii janata lalu yadav kii itani safaai se sahamat nahin hai
 Now it is to be seen whether Nitish Kumar takes action or gives the learning of morality only to others
 'unhone kaha ki isamen pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi ke kisi netaa kaa haath nahin he
 If a case is brought before the agency, it will be investigated
 isliye pradhanmantri modi ji or bijepi par aarope lagaana galat baat he
 Lalu Yadav himself has been saying that Nitish Kumar's teeth are not in the mouth but in his intestine (stomach)
 ab lalu yadav nitish kumaar ke aant vaale daant se ghayal ho rahe hai, isliye lalu yadav khud hi jaanate hai ki kahaan se kya ho rahaa he
 'he said,' It is very difficult to identify when Nitish Kumar does friendship
 bahut kam log unhen is rup main pahchaan paye hai
 Yes, my understanding says that Lalu Yadav has recognized this form of Nitish Kumar
 jidhar jaaenge naav duubegikushvaha ne kaha ki bijepi nitish kumaar ko samarthan degi yaa nahin yah kaalpanik sawaal he
 Nitish Kumarchahe come here or go there, the boat is sure to sink wherever you go
 unhone kaha ki bijepi unki pratidwandvi party he
 If any mater comes to her, she will definitely raise it
 There is no fault of the BJP, but Lalu Yadav's friends are there
 nitish kumaar agar wo sawaal uthaa rahe hai to badi baat he
 Lalu Yadav should see about Nitish Kumar

 com / gr4s5uvwos Since the price of onion has increased, people across the country are experimenting with different types
 kuch vakt pehle hi ek khabar saamne ai thi, jisamen ek dukaan mobile phone kharidne par 1 kilo pyaaj muft dene kaa ofer chalaa rahi thi
 After this, abhibus, now an online bus ticket platform from Hyderabad
 com (abhibus
 com) has made similar offers to its customers
 company ke paas kul 4 ofer hai
 One of them is a full-paid Goa trip, an iphone, e-bike and three kilos of onions, but surprisingly, most people are taking the offer with three kilos of free onions
 company ne pyaaj kaa ofer isliye diya he kyonki pichley kuch vakt main pyaaj ke daam kaaphi bade hai
 Onion prices have reached Rs 200 a kg in many parts of the country and many mimes and jokes are being made on social media
 10 disambar ko yah ofer banaae jane ke baad company ke placeform par 54 fisadi logon ne ofer main pyaaj chunaa he
 At the same time, only 46 percent people have opted for Goa offer
 khabar ke mutabik company ne kaha, ''jis tarah se log anya ophers ko chhodkar pyaaj kaa ofer chun rahe hai, use dekh kar kaha ja saktaa he ki unke dainik jivan main pyaaj kitna jaruri he''
 The company draws lucky draws daily, out of which it chooses 20 people and delivers 3 kg of onions to their homes
 abhibas ke sioo rohit shame ne kaha, ''hamaari company graahakon ko alag-alag ofer dekar lagaataar nae prayog kar rahi he jo unki yatra ko mjedaar or sukhad banaata he or unki badalati jaruraton ko bhi puraa karata he
 Our priority is focused on providing strong customer support to consumers ''
 tyaag or balidaan kaa doosraa naam maa hi he
 He is the one who ties the troubles of the world to the end of his zone so that his children do not suffer
 sach kahuun maa banane ke baad maa ke liye sammaan or bad gaya
 The path to becoming a mother is not easy
 asli mushkilen to maa banane ke baad hi shuru hoti he
 Even after becoming a mother, i realized how much suffering my mother must have suffered
 garbh main pal rahaa ehsaas jab bahon main aayaa to jaise duniya kii sari khushiyaan mil gayi
 My whole world was reduced to both of us
 tamaam takalifon ke baad bhi uski ek jhalak dekhte hi sab khubasurat sa ho gaya
 Seeing him grow up slowly before his eyes gives a different pleasure
 bachche ke peeche daudte bhaagate kitni baar aisa laga ki ab bas
 
 
 i am tired but the mother comes to you every time and gets encouragement
 lori sunaanaa, sulaanaa, pyaar se uthaakar use khilaanaa, ye sab tumne bhi to kiya hoga mere liye
 You too must have handled everything alone
 ghar-parivaar or ham bhai-bahanon ko
 Never seen you, but you must have gone through some problem
 tumne hameshaa mujhe sahi or galat kaa fark samajhaayaa
 Always kept time for me even while away
 aaj ek maa banane ke baad bhi main tumhaare saamne khud ko bacchee hi maanati hum or tumne bhi mujhe bada hone hi nahin diya
 Many things have changed since becoming a mother
 yakeen karogi mere andar peshens aa gaya he
 Today, on Mother's Day, i hope that by seeing you, i have been able to give my child the form that i have understood
 use vahi pyaar or sanskaar de sakuun jo tumne mujhe diya

 varsh 1963 main jab main bhartiya videsh seva (iesces) kaa hissaa bana, mujhe free uniwarsity of brussels bheja gaya, taaki main apni 'anivaary videshi bhashaa' - french sikh sakuun
 It happened that our class was the subject of experiment for the first audio-visual teaching course, so a language psychologist was added to our class to see that different nationalities - Syrian, Turkish, German, Italian, Peruvian , Cuban, Japanese American - This class, consisting of people with only one French-speaking teacher, captures the language
 jald hi spasht ho gaya ki donon bhartiya - capi balakrishnan tathaa main - class ke baaki logon se kahin aage the, or ham donon ne kuch hi hafton main bhashaa ke mul siddhanton ko sikh liya
 i asked that psychologist, how is this happening - is it because we are smarter than the rest, or there is something in our background, that is why we are learning a foreign language faster than the rest of the people
 unhone kaha ki baaki class kii tulana main ham donon ke aage nikal jane kaa kaaran behad saral he
 Language psychology established a long time ago that people who grow up learning two languages can learn a third language quicker than adults who have a cut-off age of 35 years
 Adults learned language
 mere sahpaathee capi balakrishnan kii maatrubhaasha malayalam thi, jabaki meri maatrubhaasha tamil he, ham donon kii hi hindi par bhi acchhee pakad thi, or nishchit rup se ham donon angrezi bhi jaanate the, so, french ham donon ke liye chauthi bhashaa thi, so, isi kaaran ham baaki sabhi se, khaastaur se ameriganon se (jinhen sahi angrezi bhi nahin aati, or jinhen 'american' kahe jane vaale ek alag hi lahaze ko sikhaakar paala jaataa he), kahin aage nikal gaye
 Those who become an IFS have to learn their compulsory foreign language to such an extent that they can pass oral and written tests, and only then they are regularized in service
 musuri main hue pehle charan kaa prashikshan khatm karne se pehle hi hamen anivaary rup se hindi main bhi maukhik tathaa likhit pariksha paas kerani padi thi
 So, even though we had all passed our civil service exam in English, we had to gain considerable authority over at least three languages - English, Hindi and a foreign language - before coming into regular service
 iske itar, bhale hi ve din lagbhag 40 saal pehle biit chuke hai, jab mujhe rozaana french bolne kaa mauka miltaa tha, aaj bhi agar kabhi mujhase french main saakshaatkaar liya jaataa he, yaa koi french bolne vaala miltaa he, mujhe hairaani hoti he ki french meri jubaan par kitni aasaani se laut aati he
 In the same way, our fellow IAS (indian Administrative Service) compulsorily had to pass the Hindi examination, but also to become regular in their out-of-home deployment (which happens in about two-thirds of cases)
 Before that, the language of the state where the deployment was made had to be learned
 jab main apni jaankaree main uttar pradesh ke do sabase kaamyaab mukhya sachivon kalyankrishnan tathaa tiesar subramanyam ke bare main sochataa hum, spasht ho jaataa he ki prashasnic seva ke adhikari ke rup main tarakkee kerani he to rajya kii bhashaa seekhni hi hogi
 On the other hand, in my parliamentary constituency in Tamil Nadu, i also met a lot of sdms and collectors, many of them from Hindi-speaking states, and had good or appreciative Tamil knowledge (while it was generally exceptionally difficult for Indians to learn Tamil
 Happens, because unlike other Indian languages, Tamil has no roots in Sanskrit, and Sanskrit's influence on it is minor)
 mujhe lagata he, si-sat se judi samasya ke hal kaa beej apane anubhavon ke jariye hamaare paas yahi he
 Why should Aptitude Test be conducted in English only? If we say, the aptitude test will check the knowledge of any two Indian languages (one of which may be English), and 200 C-SAT marks will be divided equally in these two languages, then it becomes a common platform for all the candidates
 Will go, no matter their language
 spasht he ki sabhi abhyarthi in donon main se ek bhashaa main to praveen honge hi, or duusari bhashaa main kuch kam praveen honge
 So, no one will be able to get unnecessary benefit in the language proficiency test, and even if English is removed from these two languages, the opportunities will be equal for everyone, because each candidate must have proficiency in two languages
 Will be
 vastav main isse hindibhashiyon ko tamil athwa malayalam athwa bangla athwa oriya athwa mizo athwa asmi seekhney ke liye protsaahan milegaa, jisase rashtriya akhandta majboot hogi
 In an earlier blog i had quoted the statement of Tamil MP Ira Sezian, in response to Atal Bihari Vajpayee's statement - Hindi Prachar Sabha exists in every southern state
 ira ne kaha tha, "or aapke paas uttar pradesh main kitni tamil prachaar sabha hai, or kitni malayalam prachaar sabha madhya pradesh main hai
 
 
 ? "if proficiency in any other modern Indian language will be required for the C-SAT Aptitude Test, then those who consider English to be the product of imperialism should learn any other Indian language - Telugu, perhaps Konkani, Kannada or Urdu - Will get a discount
 parantu yah sawaal uth khadaa hota he ki vah tamilbhaashi kya karegaa, jisane si-sat ke liye duusari bhashaa ke rup main malayalam ko chunaa tha? tamilnadu or kerala ke baahar in donon bhashaaon ko koun bolta-samajhataa he? vah tamilbhaashi apane uttari, purvi, pashchimi or uttar-purvi sahyogiyon ke saath kaise vichaar-vimarsh karegaa? uttar saral he
 To be regular in service, the candidate must pass the Hindi test, and if he is posted in Maharashtra or Gujarat, he must also have a working knowledge of Marathi or Gujarati
 kisi bhi prashaasak ke liye uske kaaryon se judi bhashaagat yogyata katai zaruri he
 His knowledge of English literature and litterateurs would not be of any use to him if he had to go to Arunachal Pradesh to work
 yahaan sawaal hindi or angrezi kaa nahin he
 If it were, we could get rid of English
 parantu jin logon kii maatrubhaasha hindi nahin he, ve chintit hote hai ki yadi 42 pratishat hindibhashiyon ko 58 pratishat gaiyr-hindibhashiyon (jinke liye hindi sikhi hui bhashaa he, maatrubhaasha nahin) par is tarah tarjeeh di jaaegi, to hindibhashiyon kaa gaiyr-hindibhashiyon par sthaayee prabhutv sthapit ho jayega, or ham usee sthiti main pahunch jaaenge, jisamen varsh 1971 se pehle pakistan tha, jiske purvi hisse main urdu bolne vaale alpsankhyakon ne banglabhashi bahusnkhyakon par sthaayee bhashaayi prabhutv sthapit karne ke prayaas kiya
 For this reason, non-hindi speaking states tolerate loss from English, but they are not ready to bear the loss that non-hindi speaking people would have by making Hindi the only official language of minorities in their state
 alag-alag bhashaaon ko anumati dene ke baad dikhne vaali gaiyr-barabari se bhi ham barabari kaa maahaul hasil kar sakate hai, yadi si-sat aptitude test abhyarthi kii icchaanusaar kinhin bhi do aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon main liya jaae, or ek bhashaa angrezi hone kii anivaaryta hataa di jaae
 This attempt to throw away English speakers by making Hindi or any other Indian language the only language in C-SAT will be strongly opposed in the Northeastern states (eg English is the official language in Nagaland, where 16 local dialects are spoken)
 iskaa virodh kai or sthanon par bhi hoga, jahaan kaha jayega ki angrezi sahitya ratkar nobel or main-bukar puraskaar jeet chuke bharat ke paas bhartiyata main dhaali ji chuki angrezi he, bhale hi us bhashaa kaa mul kahin bhi rahaa ho
 English, which has been molded into Indianness, is as much an Indian language as the American form of British English in America
 (vaise, england main bhi angrezi bhashaa kii 'hatya' saikadon tareekon se kii jaati rahi he - professor higins ne maai fere ladi main kaha tha, "oh
 
 
 Why can't the British teach their children how to speak properly
 
 
 " yaa dhyaan den ki 21veen sadi main hue scottish or welsh swatantraaa sangram kii jad main angrezi-virdohi bhashabhakti hi thi)
 It is also worth noting that all other examinations (whose marks are counted in the final exam) can be written in English, Hindi or any scheduled language
 so, yadi ham aptitude test se angrezi kii anivaaryta hataa bhi den, to bhi ham abhyarthi ko 200 main se sirf 70 ank kaa laabh de rahe hai, jabaki 200 main se kul 70 ank laakar vah vaise bhi mukhya pariksha main shaamil hone kii yogyata hasil kar saktaa he, jahaan angrezi kaa gyaan katai zaruri nahin he
 But even if these 70 marks are not embraced by those who do not know English or are reluctant to learn English, let these 70 marks go, but remember, they will have to learn two more languages before they become regular in service, if they are Hindi speaking , And if they are not Hindi-speaking, they will have to learn three other languages (english, Hindi and a state or foreign language)
 phir bhi agar mukherjee nagar main hadtaal par baithe abhyarthiyon kii hataasha ko dur karne ke liye angrezi kii anivaaryta ko hataanaa zaruri he, to aisa hi hone dijie
 But if Modi remains adamant on his election promises to Hindiize everything, then this country will become fragmented
 is vakt to vah rode atakaate mahasoos ho rahe hai
 If he feels that he can overcome this crisis by promoting language-related stubbornness, then it is said in the old proverb - "this time there will be no rain, fire will start
" 
 
 " Moji Ji, a Gujarati in the past said, "english is the language of international commerce, it is the language of diplomacy, and it also has a rich literary treasury, it also introduces western ideas and culture
 
 
 isliye, hamamen se kuch ke liye angrezi kaa gyaan zaruri he
 
 
 " us gujarati kaa naam mahatma gandhi tha
 
 
 He was absolutely right that 'for some' - but only for some - knowledge of English is important
 kyonki yahi ve 'kuch' hai, jo oonche prashasnic padon par baithe hai
 No one else is required to know English, and no one will get them to refuse to learn English
 gandhi ji ne yah bhi kaha tha, "angrezi prem se chhutkaaraa paanaa swaraj kaa ek zaruri hissaa he
 
 
 "we have got rid of 'english love' by exempting the examinations whose marks are numbered to determine rankings in English, Hindi or any scheduled language
" ab sirf 70 ank hai, jinke liye angrezi anivaary he
 Let us get rid of that too, but we should not get rid of the fact that the administrative officer has knowledge of languages
 iske liye hamen jor dena hoga ki abhyarthi ko praarambhik pariksha (prilims) uteern karne ke liye kinhin bhi do bhartiya bhashaaon kaa gyaan kam se kam 70 ank paane ke laayak hona chahie, lekin is baat par bhi jor dena hoga ki use pratham yaa dwitiya shrenee ke sarkari adhikari ke rup main kaam par niyamit hone se pehle angrezi, hindi or ek teesri bhashaa main praveen hona hi hoga
 This is the real challenge, and it is also a way to solve the current crisis of UPSC-C-SAT

 Let us tell you that it is a big challenge for BJP to get the magic figure of 112 mlas in the House
 congress-jedies ne apane ek-ek vidhayakon par paharaa laga rakhaa he or puure maamle par supreme court kii najar he
 Governor Vajubhai Vala may have administered the oath to the Yeddyurappa government, but there are five reasons why Yeddyurappa's government is certain to go! The number game is not in favor of BJP, elections have been held for 222 seats in Karnataka Assembly
 bahumat ke liye 112 siton kii jarurat hogi
 104 BJP mlas have won
 jedies ke 37 or congress ke 78 vidhayak or 3 anya dalon ke vidhayak jeet kar aae hai
 Yeddyurappa will need 8 additional mlas to prove his majority
 haalanki jedies ke kumaraswami do siton se jitkar vidhayak bane hai
 In such a situation, he will have to resign from one seat
 aisi haalat main phir 221 seat ke lihaaj se bijepi ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye 111 siton kii jarurat padegi
 In such a situation, the majority game is not seen in favor of BJP
 vipaksh ke paas spasht bahumatakarnataka main congress or jedies alag-alag hokar chunaav lade the, lekin nattejey ke baad donon partiyon ne haath mila liya he
 This figure reaches 116, including 78 of Congress, 37 of JDS and 1 of BSP
 iske alaava ek nirdaleey vidhayak kaa bhi samarthan he
 In this way the number of opposition reaches 117
 inke paas bahumat se 5 vidhayak zyada hai
 If the opposition manages to save the legislators from breaking up till the last moment, then Yeddyurappa's departure is certain
 congress-jds ke 14 MLA sadan se baahar rakhanabijepi ke paas 104 vidhayak hai
 With this strength, the BJP government can pass a majority only when the number of 221 mlas is 207 in the House
 congress or jedies ke 14 vidhayakon istipha den yaa phir bahumat ke dauraan sadan se baahar rahen
 It is a big challenge for the BJP to keep 14 opposition mlas out of the House or to resign them
 congress-jedies apane vidhayakon ko saath rakhane main safal rahati he to yediurppa kii kursi jaani tay he
 The rules of defection law in case of cross voting: If Yeddyurappa can prove majority in BJP, if Congress and seven JDS mlas can vote in their favor
 lekin dalbadal kanoon ke niyam ke tahat un vidhayakon kii sadsyta chali jaaegi
 In such a situation, the crisis on the stability of the government will continue
 congress jis tarah se har maamle ko supreme court main le ja rahi he, aise main yediurppa par sankat ke badal chhaae rahenge
 The example of Uttarakhand, Arunachal must be remembered in the case of Arunachal and Uttarakhand
 congress in donon rajyon ke udhaaharan ko lekar karnataka maamle ko supreme court main dastak de sakati he
 In both these states, the BJP had formed the government in Arunachal by ousting the Congress
 jabaki vahiin uttarakhand main bijepi ne congressi vidhayakon ko todakar raashtrapati shashan lagavaaya tha
 The Congress went to the High Court on this matter, where the decision of President's rule was repealed and the Congress was again in power
 agar karnataka main bhi yediurppa is tareeke se apni sarkaar bachaa paane main safal rahete hai to congress phir se supreme court kii sharan main ja sakati he
 Delhi Congress President Sheila Dikshit met senior party leader Sonia Gandhi on Saturday and denied that there was any discussion on the issue of alliance with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during the meeting
 sutron ne haalanki kaha ki dilli main aap ke saath gathbandhan ke mudde par baithak ke dauraan charchaa hui
 When asked if the issue of coalition had come up during the meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Dixit said, "the decision (against the alliance with AAP) after the meeting with Rahul Gandhi is still intact
" AICC sutron ne kaha, “sonia gandhi or dikshit ke bich mulaakaat ke dauraan gathbandhan ke mudde par charchaa hui or sonia ne unase congress or aap ke bich voton ke vibhaajan se bijepi ke liye chunaavon main jeet kaa rasta banane ke parinaam par vichaar karne ko kaha
 The Delhi Congress leader rejected any talks on the alliance during the meeting between the two leaders
 dilli congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh devendra yadav ne kaha, shila ji somvaar ko prastaavit hamaare booth kaaryakarta sammelan ke liye sonia gandhi ko nimantran dene gai thim or yah ek afvaah he ki gathbandhan par charchaa hui jise pehle hi khaarij kiya ja chukaa he
 Rajesh Lilothia, another executive president of the Delhi unit of the Congress, said that Sonia Gandhi had already said that the party president would take a decision on issues related to the party
 unhone kaha, aisi sthiti main vah gathbandhan ke mudde par kaise rahul gandhi ke virodhabhasi kuch kah sakati hai
 In the midst of an uproar over the alliance with the Congress to contest against the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, the AAP said that instead of taking the cover of its Delhi unit to Congress President Rahul Gandhi, a decision on seat-sharing with AAP, given the situation in the country should do
 aap kii dilli ikai ke sanyojak gopal raay ne kaha, aap ne gathbandhan ke liye saidhantik faisla kiya or iske liye loksabhaa chunaav main loktantr ko bachaane or dilli kii janata kii aawaaj ko majboot karne kii jarurat ko samajha, jabaki party ke andar aapattiyaan saamne ai thim
 Rahul Gandhi had said this morning that the state unit of Congress does not want an alliance with AAP
 raay ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki yaa to rahul gandhi desh ke halaat ko nahin samaj rahe hai yaa apni party ke sanghathan ko samajha nahin paa rahe hai
 Instead of taking the cover of his state unit, Rahul should take a decision
 unhone kaha, hamaare kaaryakarta gathbandhan nahin chaahate hai
 Many leaders are personally against it
 lekin desh ke hit main gathbandhan karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Delhi Congress President Sheila Dixit on Tuesday announced after meeting with the Congress President that there was a consensus against an alliance with AAP
 is ghoshnaa ke baad aap sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki is tarah kii afvaahen hai ki congress kii bhaajapa ke saath gupt samaj ban gayi he or unki party is ‘apavitra gathbandhan' se mukaable ko taiyaar he
 Rai told reporters that it is a different matter what the Delhi Congress says about the alliance, but Gandhi should take a responsible decision in this regard, considering the challenges like the dictatorship of the BJP government at the Center

 The Samajwadi Party, which broke away from the lalu-nitish 'grand Alliance' in Bihar, has formed a new front only after two weeks
 nae gathjod ke tahat mulaayam singh yadav ensipi or janata dal democratic ke saath milakar chunavi maidan main ummidavaar utaarenge
 According to the information, PA Sangma's Nationalist Congress Party will also support the SP in the elections
 yani rajya main chunavi sameekaran samay ke saath jahaan or mjedaar hote ja rahe hai, vahiin kiski khichdi kahaan pak rahi he or satta ke liye daal kiski galegi yah kahana ab or bhi kathin ho chalaa he
 Actually, till now there was a direct fight between two big alliances in the state
 jediu-argedy or congress kaa 'mahagathbandhan'bijepi nit endie ke khilaaf khadaa he
 Nitish Kumar is the face for the grand alliance, while the NDA is moving forward under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin kuch dinon se jis tarah rajya main raajnneetik halchal machi he, har dal or gathbandhan ke liye chunaav kii dagar mushkil hoti ja rahi he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav is unhappy with his party being given only 5 seats out of 243 assembly seats under the grand alliance
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone do hafte pehle hi sapa ko gathbandhan se alag kar liya
 Laloo Prasad, who talked about tying up family relations in political circles, went to convince his relatives, but became soft and tough
 do hafte baad hi mulaayam ne jo trump card chalaa he, usase kuch ghaataa mahagathbandhan ko jarur hota dikh rahaa he
 On the other hand, NCP is also angry with the lalu-nitish pair
 use gathbandhan dharm ke naam par 3 siton kaa prastaav mila tha, jise party ne nakaar diya
 Although neither the SP nor the NCP have any special substance in Bihar, both parties have come under discussion due to joining the Grand Alliance and then splitting up after the split
 kiski kitni raajnneetik haisiyatbihar kii raajnneeti kii baat karen to 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party or ensipi donon kii jholii khaali rahi thi
 Whereas in last year's Lok Sabha elections, NCP had to be satisfied with only one seat
 sapako yahaan bhi ek boond naseeb nahin hui
 The Third Morchasp leader Ram Gopal Yadav has described himself as a 'third Front'
 is shabdaawalee kaa istemaal aam taur par gaiyr-congress or gaiyr-bijepi raajnneetik gathbandhan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Apparently, the SP has given clear indications that it will not back down from opposing lalu-nitish
 haalanki, in sab ke bich yah baat bhi myne rakhti he ki loksabhaa chunaav main beete saal bijepi ne 40 se 32 siten jiti thim or uske baad hi jediu-argedy or sapa ne saath aane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Meanwhile, Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM from Seemanchal has also decided to contest the election and the Shiv Sena has also beaten the electoral table

 i told her that my mother is not at home and i cannot come to the rehab center alone

 He asked the victim's mother to help him handle the father's business and took all the trucks, but when the victim's mother went to take payment, he turned back

 Therefore, it is being speculated whether this investigation will be completed within the stipulated time
 chhattisgarh police mukhyalay par bijapur or sukama main adivasee mahilaon ke yon shoshan ke maamle kii jaanch ko lekar dabaav lagaataar badhata ja rahaa hai
 CID investigations are on in this matter
 ghatana varsh 2015-16 kii he, jab kul 34 adivasee mahilaon ne police or kendriya suraksha bal par unke saath badsulki or samuhik balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 These are the same women who accused the police and the central security forces of rape, and the victims of the incident had also lodged a complaint with the police
 ye mahilaayein aaj bhi apane aaropon par kaayam he
 However, CID has not yet recorded their statements
 ye mahilaayein bataa rahi hai ki aakhir suraksha balon ke jawan un par kis tarah se julm dhaate hai
 In the initial investigation into the allegations against the police and central security forces, 18 women withdrew their charges
 haalanki 16 mahilaayein apane saath hue balaatkaar ke aaropon par dati raheen
 After this, the Chhattisgarh Police Headquarters directed the CID to investigate the case
 dedh saal baad bhi CID kii jaanch report kaa intjaar hai
 Meanwhile, the aggrieved women made their request in the NHRC
 siaidi kii jaanch to lambit rahi lekin NHRC ne peedit mahilaon ke paksh main faisla sunaaya
 The NHRC has confirmed the gang rape of these women as well as issued a notice to the Chhattisgarh government directing them to complete the CID investigation within a month
 ayog ne rajya sarkaar se yah bhi poocha kii kyon naa wo peediton ko muaavja bhi de
 Victimized women are demanding justice for themselves
 ilaake kii saamaajik kaaryakarta soni sori in mahilao ke samarthan main juty hai
 The first incident of excesses and mistreatment with women was in October 2015 at Peddagulur and Chindragulur of Basaguda police station
 duusari ghatana janvari 2014 main sukama ke kudapi gaanv kii, jabaki teesri ghatana janvari 2014 main bijapur ke lendra gaanv main hui thi
 In all three incidents, the victim women accused the soldiers of the police and central security forces that they gang-raped and beat them
 teenon hi ghatnaon main kul 34 mahilaon ne yon hinsa kii shikaayat sthaneey thanon main darj karai thi lekin inamen se sirf 16 mahilaon kii medical jaanch or bayaan darj kiye gaye the
 On the other hand, the police are replying in this case
 uske mutabik maamle kii abhi jaanch chal rahi he
 Police officers are not making any statements on camera in this case
 haalanki is maamle ko lekar maanav adhikaaravaadi kaaryakarta, police or kendriya surakshabalon ko aade haathon le rahe he, unki nigahen CID report par lagi hui hai
 It is imperative to see if the police can send their report to the NHRC within the time limit
 maharashtra ke bhandara gondia lok sabha seat se bijepi ke saansad nanabhau patole ne istipha de diya he
 Along with his resignation, Patole has also questioned the working style of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bataa den ki ye pehla maamla nahin he, jab patole ne baghawat kar istipha saunpa he
 The image of Nanabhau Patole, who spent nearly three decades in Indian politics, has emerged as a rebel
 congress main jari rahaa aana-janapahale shivasena se kinaaraa karne vaale patole ne congress kaa daaman thama, lekin 1992 main bhandara jilha parishad ke chunaav main party ummidavaar madhukar lichade ke khilaaf nirdaliachunavladakar jeet hasil kii
 However, he soon returned to the Congress and left the Congress in the 1995 assembly elections
 lakhdur nirvachan kshetra se nanabhau patole party pratyaashee pramila ke khilaaf khadey jarur hue, lekin jeet bijepi ke dayaram kii hui
 With his return to the Congress, Patole won Lakhondoor in the 1999 and 2004 assembly elections
 saal 2009 main kisaanon or vidarbha ke vikaas ke mudde par patole ne congress se istipha de diya
 He contested the Lok Sabha election as an independent candidate and finished second
 is chunaav main ensipi ke prafull patel kii jeet hui, jabaki bijepi saansad rahe shishupal patle tisare number rahe
 After winning the election by joining BJP, Patole joined BJP and won the Sakoli seat in the 2009 assembly elections
 patole ko vidhansabha main bijepi kii upanetaa chun liya gaya
 Patole defeated NCP candidate Praful Patel in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 piem modi par patole ke aropasadhe teen saal baad nanabhau patole pradhanmantri narendra modi paranishanaa saadhane lage
 In September, Patole alleged in an event in Nagpur that PM Modi does not listen to anyone and in the party meeting, the PM did not let him speak when he was raising the issue of farmers
 beete teen maah se patole maharashtra main bijepi sarkaar par hallaa bol rahe hai
 PM Modi and CM Devendra Fadnavis have been his constant targets
 akola main purv vitt mantri va varisht bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha dwaara yojit kisaan andolan main bhi patole shaamil hue the
 'patole ki saga nahi', says a senior Congress leader that Nanabhau Patole has never been loyal to any party
 congress netaa ne kaha ki kisaanon kaa mudda sirf ek dikhaava he, patole mantri pad kii chahat rakhte hai or bijepi dwaara nazarandaaj karne par unhen party chhodane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Congress chief Ashok Chavan in Maharashtra, ready to welcome, said, 'we welcome Patole because in politics we have to think out of the box

 But many such members are not coming to the House
 unhone kaha ki iskaa matlab yah ho saktaa he ki unki ruchi isamen nahin he, or agar unki ruchi nahin he to unhen istipha de dena chahie
 Both Tendulkar and Rekha were nominated to the House in 2012

 a new era will begin
 mahendra singh dhoni ne kal simit overon kii captaini chhod di or aise main ab test captain kohli ko in donon praroopon main team kii aguwai karne kaa jimmaa saunpa ja saktaa he
 There is no doubt about Kohli being given the responsibility of captaincy, but it will not be easy for the selectors to choose the two teams keeping the right balance as many players are still battling injuries
 mumbai ke do ballebaaj rohit sharma or anjiky rahane chotil hone ke kaaran baahar hai
 This allows Shikhar Dhawan, who is in poor form, to be given the responsibility of opening the innings with KL Rahul in the event of a fit
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki chayankarta kisi bilkul nae khilaadi par bharosa dikhaaen
 Rahul of Karnataka did not play in the ODI series against New Zealand due to injury, while Delhi batsman Dhawan was also injured during the Test series against New Zealand
 baayen haath ke ballebaaj dhawan janvari main aakhri baar australia main vanade match khele the
 After being a flop in the first two matches, he scored a century and two half-centuries in the next three games
 england ke khilaaf paanchaven or antim test match main tihara shatak jadne vaale karun nair ko rahane ke sthaan par simit overon kii team main chune jane kii sambhaavna he
 Second off-spinner Jayant Yadav had to stay out of the last Test match against England due to injury
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya chayankarta match fitness sabit kiye bina in donon gendbaaji oleroundaron kaa chayan karte hai yaa nahin
 Even though Dhoni has stepped down from the captaincy, he has kept himself available as a player
 chayankartaaon ko bhi isse avgat kara diya gaya he jo ki anya daavedaaron par unhen hi tarjeeh denge
 Akshar Patel was picked as the left-arm spinner by resting Ravindra Jadeja against New Zealand, but now Jadeja can be included in the squad after getting plenty of rest between Test and ODI
 us team main yadav ke saath amit mishra tisare spinner the
 The comments manish pandey or kedaar jadhav ke alaava mandeep singh vanade team main apni jagah banaae rakh sakate hai
 Mohammed Shami and Dhawal Kulkarni, who did not play in the ODI series against New Zealand, are out due to injury, while the selectors can choose Ishant Sharma along with good in-form Jaspreet Bumrah and Umesh Yadav
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Mahendra Singh Dhoni relinquished the limited overs captaincy yesterday and in such a situation, now Test captain Kohli can be tasked to lead the team in both these formats
 kohli ko captaini kaa jimmaa saunpe jane ko lekar kisi tarah kaa andeh nahin he lekin chayankartaaon ke liye uchit santulan banaate hue do tiimon kaa chayan karnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki kai khilaadi ab bhi choton se jujh rahe hai
 Two Mumbai batsmen Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane are out due to injury
 isse kharaab form main chal rahe shikhar dhawan ko feet hone kii sthiti main keel rahul ke saath pari kaa aagaaj karne kii jimmedaari saunpi ja sakati he
 It may also happen that the selectors show confidence in an entirely new player
 karnataka ke rahul chotil hone ke kaaran newjiland ke khilaaf vanade siries main nahin khel paae the jabaki dilli ke ballebaaj dhawan bhi newjiland ke khilaaf test siries ke dauraan chotil ho gaye the
 Left-handed batsman Dhawan last played an ODI in Australia in January
 pehle do maichon main flop rahane ke baad unhone agle teen maichon main ek shatak or do ardhashatak lagaae di
 Karun Nair, who scored a triple century in the fifth and final Test match against England, is likely to be selected in the limited-overs squad in place of Rahane
 duusare of spinner jayant yadav ko chotil hone ke kaaran england ke khilaaf aakhri test match se baahar rahanaa padaa tha
 It will be interesting to see whether the selectors select these two bowling all-rounders without proving match fitness
 dhoni bhale hi captaini se hat gaye hai lekin unhone ek khilaadi ke rup main khud ko uplabdh rakhaa he
 The selectors have also been made aware of this, which will give them preference over other contenders
 newjiland ke khilaaf ravindra jadeja ko vishram dekar akshar patel ko baayen haath ke spinner ke rup main chunaa gaya tha, lekin ab test or vanade ke bich kaaphi vishram milane ke baad jadeja ko team main liya ja saktaa he
 Amit Mishra was the third spinner along with Yadav in that team
 tippaniyan Apart from Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav, Mandeep Singh can retain his place in the ODI team
 newjiland ke khilaaf vanade siries main nahin khilne vaale mohammad shami or dhaval kulkarni chotil hone ke kaaran baahar hai to chayankarta achche form main chal rahe jasprit bumraah or umesh yadav ke saath eshanth sharma ko chun sakate hai

 We are all aware of the tug of American sprinter Justin Gatlin and Usain Bolt
 is baar gatelin ne 100 meter kii res main yusen bolt se bhi kam samay apane naam kar liya he
 But it is considered an important role of wings
 is daud main gatelin kii madad ke liye hai-power pankhe lagaaye gayi the, isliye unke record ko manyata nahin milegi
 The 100-meter race record is named after Usain Bolt
 jamaica ke bolt ne 2009 main berlin world championships main 100 meter main 9
 a record of 58 seconds was made
 gatelin ne ye stant ek japani game sho ke liye kiya he
 The comments vaise gatelin ke is sho ke baad aalochak ye bhi aarope laga rahe hai ki gatelin, bolt ko haraane ke liye itane beqaraar hai ki ab bolt se aage nikalne ke liye pankhons kaa sahaara le liya
 Gatlin completed the 100-meter race for a Japanese game show 'kasupe' with wings with the help of wings for 20 million Japanese yen, or about 11 lakh rupees
 res ke dauraan gatelin ke trek par apane peeche ek or khaas jagahon par chaar pankhe lagaae the
 With the help of wings, he was helped at a speed of 32 km / h, which is four times the limit
 gatelin par do baar doping kii vajah se (2001 or 2006 main) pratibandh bhi lag chukaa he
 But it is clear from his efforts that the thrill of 100 meter race during Rio Olympics will be more than ever
 100 meter kii res kaa record yusen bolt ke naam he
 Bolt of Jamaica won 9 in the 100 meters at the 2009 Berlin World Championships
 58 second kaa record banaaya tha
 Gatlin did this stunt for a Japanese game show
 tippaniyan However, after Gatlin's show, critics are also alleging that Gatlin is so incapable of defeating Bolt that he now resorted to wings to overtake Bolt
 gatelin ne ek japani game sho 'kasupe' ke liye 20 lakh japani yen yani qareeb 11 lakh rupee ke liye pankhons kii madad se pankh lagaakar 100 meter kii res puri kar lee
 During the race, Gatlin had four fans on one of his back and other special places on the track
 pankhons ke sahare unhen 32 kilometre / ghanta kii raftaar kii madad mili jo tay seemaa se chaar guna zyaada he
 Gatlin has also been banned twice (in 2001 and 2006) for doping
 lekin unki koshishon se saafe he ki rio olympix ke dauraan 100 meter kii res ko lekar romaanch pehle se kahin zyaada hoga
