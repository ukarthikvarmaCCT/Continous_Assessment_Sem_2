 But in the last few years many Panthic Sikh organizations, Radical groups and many political parties have been calling Sarbat Khalsa according to their advantages and disadvantages
 isi vajah se punjab police is aayojan ko lekar sakhti kar rahi he
 After the alert of the Central agencies and the strictness of the police, the Punjab Police got the impression that now the Khalsa in this matter will not be organized and due to this, the petition filed in the punjab-haryana High Court in support of the Khalsa in this regard
 Is withdrawn

 Both teams' World Cup journey has ended
 pakistan ko world cap ke aage ke safar ke liye aise antar se jeetna he, jo asambhav mana ja rahaa he
 After England beat New Zealand, it does not seem possible for Pakistan to go to the semi-finals
 pakistan aage tabhi ja saktaa he, jab pehle ballebaaji karte hue 400 kaa score khadaa kare or phir bangladesh ko 84 ranon par out kar de
 Pakistan's journey ends immediately after losing the toss
 If Pakistan loses the toss, it will be out of the semi-final race and if it wins the toss and takes the bat first, then it will have to win the match by 316 runs
 yah jeet kaa vah antar he, jo ab tak vanade itihaas main kisi bhi team ne hasil nahin kiya he
 England's victory in the 1992 Mathematics In this World Cup, Pakistan's journey so far has been the same as in 1992
 fark bas yah he ki us saal pakistani team nokout str par pahunch gai thi, lekin is saal uske raste kaaphi kathin hai
 After the defeats at the hands of India and Australia, the Pakistani team made a great comeback and defeated South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan and kept themselves in the semi-final race
 lekin iske liye use england ke match par nirbhar rahanaa tha
 If the England team had lost both their matches, then the path of Pakistan would have been cleared

 In order to provide relief to the farmers facing unseasonal rains on the wheat crop, the Modi government had promised to return 10 rupees 88 paise deducted in the name of breaking the grain
 lekin 2 maheene baad bhi kisaanon ko unki bakaayaa raashi abhi tak nahin mil pai he
 Karnail Singh, a farmer from Chandigarh, got the full price for the wheat he had sold in Kharar Mandi in Punjab, ie Rs 1450 per quintal, but FCI (food Corporation of India) bought in Chandigarh's Mandi got about 11 rupees less
 kisaan sanghathanon ke il maamle par hallaa machaane par centre ne nuksaan kii bharpai kaa bharosa diya tha
 The central government is holding back from giving the arrears of Rs 2 crore to the farmers of Punjab
 ye raqam sunne main bhale hi kam lag rahi ho, lekin yahaan baat vaadakhilaphi kii he
 Karnail Singh says that in Punjab, full money was received, but less was found in Chandigarh
 ab itnaa samay biit gaya, pataa nahin ab milegaa bhi yaa nahin
 Balraj Singh, the agent of Muktsar Grain Market, says that we have given full payment to the farmers, but we have not received the full amount yet
 rajya sarkaar centre par baat taal rahi he or centre rajya par
 We are losing between these two
 centre sarkaar kii agency epasiai ne punjab main kul 18
 48 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was purchased directly from farmers, while 80 lakh tonnes of food grains were procured through agencies of the Punjab government
 vahiin, kharid main deree par khub siyasat bhi hui thi
 Balbir Singh Rajewal, leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, says that for the first time in the country, a government imposed a value cut
 punjab sarkaar kii agenciyon ne to kisaanon ko puraa emspi (nunatam samarthan mulya) diya, lekin epasiai ne sirf 1439 rupee ke hisaab se pement kiya, jise dene main ab wo anakani kar rahi he
 Contrary to the Central Government's promise, according to the FCI order issued in April, the authorities have been given clear instructions that the payment made to the agents on their behalf should be deducted from the value cut amount
 lekin khat main saath hi ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aadhati kisaanon ko puraa emspi adaa karen, kyonki nuksaan kii bharpai kaa vaada badal sarkaar ne kiya he, lekin mukhyamantri kah rahe hai ki ye zimmedaari to centre kii he
 The comments is babat sawaal poochne par prakaash singh badal ne kaha ki ham jo bhi kharid karte hai, wo kharid centre sarkaar ke liye hoti he, pement karnaa unki zimmedaari he
 Whatever is to be given, the center will give it
 punjab ke jin kisaanon ne sidhe epasiai ko anaaj bechaa tha, un par ye dohari maar he
 First, the state government did not give compensation for the crop failure and now the central government is backing from its promise
 karz ke jaal main uljhe kisaanon ke liye raahat kii baat to ho rahi he, magar raahat un tak pahunch nahin paa rahi
 Perhaps this is why farmers like Surjit Singh are committing suicide despite getting the help of Rahul Gandhi
 centre sarkaar punjab ke kisaanon kii bakaayaa 2 karod rupee kii raashi dene se peeche hat rahi he
 The amount may seem small to hear, but here the matter is promising
 karnel singh kehete hai ki punjab main to puure paise mili, lekin chandigarh main kam mili the
 Now so much time has passed, i do not know if i will get it or not
 muktsar anaaj mandi ke aadhati balraj singh kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ko hamane puraa pement diya, lekin hamen puri raqam abhi tak nahin mili he
 The state government is avoiding talk at the center and center
 in donon ke bich hamaara nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Central government agency FCI has a total of 18 in Punjab
 48 lakh metric ton gehun sidhe kisaanon se kharida tha, jabaki 80 lakh ton anaaj kii kharid punjab sarkaar kii agenciyon ke zarie hui
 At the same time, there was a lot of politics on the delay in the purchase
 bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa balbir singh rajeval bataate hai ki desh main pehali baar kisi sarkaar ne vailu cat lagaaya
 While the Punjab government agencies gave the entire MSP (minimum Support Price) to the farmers, the FCI paid only Rs 1439, which they are now reluctant to give

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday, ignoring allegations raised from within the party in the wake of allegations of financial irregularities, said on Tuesday that it stands with its president Nitin Gadkari and is confident of them
 party ne saath hi apane netaaon ko hidaayat di ki ve is masale par saarvajanik charchaa naa karen
 The party rejected the allegations against Gadkari, stating that they had done nothing wrong either legally or on moral grounds

 According to this, in the 18 companies of Purti Group on which Gadkari has been questioned, Gadkari has not done anything wrong either legally or morally
 'bayaan main kaha gaya, 'party ko gadakari par puraa bharosa he
 He himself has come forward and said to investigate

 In Gadkari's absence, he apprised the entire matter to BJP leaders
 party unke tarko se sahamat hui
 According to Prasad, Gurumurthy had conveyed this to senior leader LK Advani early in the morning so he did not attend the evening meeting when the matter was related to Gadkari, so he deliberately abstained from the meeting
 isse pehle din bhar is prakaar kii khabaren udati rahi ki gadakari kisi bhi vakt istipha de sakate hai
 The news was bolstered by the rebellious remarks of well-known advocate and Rajya Sabha member Ram Jethmalani, in which he directly demanded Gadkari's resignation
 gadakari ke khilaaf khule taur par baghawat kaa jhanda buland karte hue jethmalani ne daawa kiya ki party ke varisht netaa yashavanth sinha, jaswant singh or shatrughna sinha bhi unke saath hai
 According to Jethmalani, they all want Gadkari to leave his post

 We are unanimous and i have no doubt about it
 unhone apane vichaar saarvajanik nahin kiye hai, main ummid karata hum ki ve jald hi apane vichaar prakat karenge
 Jethmalani also wrote a letter to Advani in this regard
 jisamen unhone kaha he ki gadakari kaa adhyaksh pad par bane rahanaa bhaajapa or desh ke liye ek traasadee he
 Jethmalani said in his letter that Gadkari should be asked to resign immediately and if the party waits till the winter session of Parliament begins it would be a betrayal of the country
 unhone kaha ki logon ko andeh hone laga he ki bhaajapa ke pramukh netaa bhrasht sattadhariyon se mili hue hai
 The well-known advocate said, 'moreover, the philosophy of resignation of public servants matches the life of government employees
 yadi kisi locasevak ke khilaaf koi jaanch chal rahi hoti he to aamtaur par use nilambit kar diya jaataa he or doshamukt ho jane par izzat ke saath use bula liya jaataa he, gadakari ke saath thik aisa hi hona chahie

 18 reconsideration petitions filed in Supreme Court in Ayodhya case: Kharijnimohi Akhara demands government to take lead role in temple construction trust Has been welcomed by the top saints and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
 unhone is ghatnakram par khushi jataate hue kaha ki ab mandir nagari main jaldi hi bhavy ram mandir kaa nirmaan hoga
 The Supreme Court's decision said that in Ayodhya, Mahant Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the temporary Ram temple told India Today, 'the top court has given the historic verdict once again
 supreme court ke november main die gaye faisle ko chunauti dene kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 i understand that a trust will soon be formed for the construction of Ram temple and the dream of seeing the grand Ram temple of crores of Hindus will be fulfilled
 ’punarvichaar yachikaaon kaa nahin tha koi aadhavyodhya ke prasiddh hanumangadhi mandir ke pujari mahant raju das ne kaha, ‘muslim pakshon kii ore se daakhil punarvichaar yachikaaon kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 The Sant community welcomes another decision of the Supreme Court
 ayodhya par faisle ke baad desh main shanti or kaumi sauhaard he
 In order to obstruct this, reconsideration petitions were filed
 ’shantipurna maahaul main mandir nirmaan par jornirmohi akhaada se jude mahant dhirendra das ne shantipurna maahaul main mandir nirmaan kiye jane par jor diya
 Mahant Das said, 'ram temple should be built in a peaceful environment

 Sharma said that VHP is hopeful that the central government will accept his demand
 tital suut main babari masjid paksh ke ahm vaadakari ikbaal ansaari ne kaha, ‘9 november ke faisle ko muslim yaa hindu pakshon kii ore se chunauti nahin di jaani chahie thi
 Decision came after decades

 Therefore, the government should now follow the decision of the Supreme Court to build the temple and mosque

 Former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, who made a place in the Modi cabinet as a defense minister, is now on the road to UP
 parrikar upi se hi rajyasabha ke raste main sadan main jagah banane vaale hai
 He arrived in Lucknow on Monday and nominated for the Rajya Sabha
 parrikar ne kaha ki vah khush hai or bhaagyashaalee mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Parrikar has reached UP the very next day after coming to the politics of the Center from the state
 lakhanu main unhone rajyasabha ke liye namakan se pehle rajyapal se mulaakaat kii
 Kalraj Mishra, a BJP leader and an important contributor to the politics of the state, said for Perkir, 'he has been sent from the Rajya Sabha from here and has been given the charge of defense minister of the country

 Chief Minister Gehlot can meet Sonia Gandhi before cabinet expansion, 3 BSP mlas can be made Minister of State and 3 can be made Parliamentary Secretary, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot can expand his cabinet after Bahujan Samaj Party mlas merge with Congress in Rajasthan
 iske saath hi sthaneey nikaay ke chunaavon se pehle board or nikaayon main raajnneetik niyuktiyaan bhi kar sakate hai
 Due to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's sudden visit to Delhi on Wednesday to meet Sonia Gandhi, speculation has intensified that the Rajasthan cabinet will expand within two-four days
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bahujan samaaj party ke jo chah vidhayak congress main shaamil hue hai, unamem se 3 ko rajyamantri or 3 ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya ja saktaa he
 The number of council of ministers in Rajasthan can be 30 and currently there are 25 ministers
 aise main 5 logon ke liye jagah khaali bachaa he
 In front of the interim national president of Congress, Sonia Gandhi, Sachin Pilot had raised the problem of law and order in the state and said that this is not going to send a message to the people that the promise with which we contested was not being fulfilled
 ise dekhte hue rajya ko grahamantri bhi mil saktaa he
 In the changed circumstances, Ashok Gehlot has become very strong in state politics and Sachin Pilot has become weak

 kya aap uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri or sapa adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke bete akhilesh yadav ko pahachaanate hai? aapkaa jawaab jo bhi ho, lekin akhilesh ko lagata he ki log unhen nahin pahachaanate
 On Tuesday, when he put his 'pain' in front of everyone in the state capital Lucknow, everyone was shocked once
 upi ke bade raajnneetik parivaar main janm lene vaale, bharat ke purv raksha mantri mulaayam singh ke bete orupi siem akhilesh yadavapradesh kii janata se aajkal kuch khafa khafa se hai
 The reason is the worry of declining popularity in public
 ji haa, agar cheharaa pahchaanane ko lokapriyata kaa paimaana maan liya jaae to pichley dinon kam se kam do maukon par unase milane aae aam log mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko pahchaan nahin paae
 Neither did he recognize the CM, nor did the minister insist on even more insistence that neither these people could recognize UP Assembly Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, nor PWD Minister Shivpal Yadav nor CM Akhilesh Yadav
 is baat ne akhilesh yadav ko asamanjas main daal diya
 The special thing was that Akhilesh was distributing relief money to the farmers suffering from unseasonal rains at that time
 mukhyamantri kaa daawa he kimuaavje kii aisi rakaman to kisi duusare rajya ne or na hi centre sarkaar ne kabhi banti
 In such a situation, the farmers and their families, who were getting help, could not recognize them
 akhilesh ne kaha, 'aap bataaie 7 se 12 lakh tak kii madad pahunchaa rahe hai
 Help was also there in the loss of crops
 abhi jab mukhyamantri karyaalay main jahaan ek kaarykram tha jahaan ek sadsy kii madad kar rahe the
 The Public Works Minister and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly were with me
 jinaki madad kii ja rahi thi us mahila se poocha ki aap lok nirmaan mantri ji ko pahachaanati hai, usne kaha nahin
 She did not even recognize the speaker
 or to or hamen bhi nahin pahachaanati thi
 So if we properly convey our point, socialists, then imagine how many members will become
 ham to kai dalon ko akele uttar pradesh main hi peeche chhod denge
 'akhilesh spurned identity pain' Actually, CM Akhilesh Yadav was answering the question of journalists on bjp's membership campaign, which painfully lost his identity by speaking
 unke mutabik sapa sarkaar lagaataar pradesh ke vikaas or janata kii bhalaai ke kaam kar rahi he, magar is kaam kaa thik se prachaar nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav blamed the party workers and the government for this
 saath hi ye bhi kah daalaa kii jis pradesh kii janata apane siem ko nahin pahchaan paa rahi he vahaan kii media ko bhi is ghatana se sabak lenaa chaiye
 When asked why people are not able to recognize him, he said, 'see, we should not live in misunderstandings
 kai baar log nahin pahachaanate hai
 Janeshwar Mishra ji had once told me
 or maine kai baar logon se poocha he or wo bilkul sahi nikali baat
 Suppose we are giving socialist pension
 garibon kii madad kar rahe hai or garib hi hamen pahchaan nahin paa rahaa he
 This help to our workers
 
 
 or hamen aapaki madad se kerani chaiye
 But there is a lesson for us as well that we are taking help from you even then the matter is not reaching
 or hamaara kaaryakarta bhi nahin pahunchaa paa rahaa he
 And the government is not able to tell that this plan was done by Samajwadi Party
 
 
 
 Look now don't make the accusation that the worker is not working
 main ye kah rahaa hum ki hamaare workars ko ye eksrasij kerani chaiye political system main ki samaajawaadee pension samaajawaadee sarkaar de rahi he
 There is a socialist government, so farmers have been given such relief
 sapa sarkaar he isaliye kisaanon kaa durghatana beemaa paanch-paanch lakh rupee or kai pariwaron ko 12-12 lakh rupaya diya gaya he
 All over the state
 'kya chunaav se pehle kii chatapataahat he?jaahir he beete loksabhaa chunaavon ke nateezon ke baad jis tarah upi sarkaar ne vikaas ke agenda par jor diya he apni baat logon tak na pahunchaa paane kii chatapataahat siem akhilesh yadav kii baton se saaf jhalak rahi he
 The 2017 elections to the Legislative Assembly are over the head and in such a situation, the Samajwadi Party government wants to improve its image among the voters by opening and launching new schemes
 shaayad isliye bemausam barsaat ke baad kisaanon kii madad ke liye jahaan centre ne abhi tak 253 karod rupaya hi bheja he upi sarkaar 1400 karod rupee baant chuki he
 In such a situation, not recognizing the farmers and common people who get help from his government, is knocking CM Akhilesh Yadav badly

 These statements are made by mps-mlas and spokespersons
 raajnneetik partiyaan inase kinaaraa kar leti hai magar samaaj ko baantne vaale or hinsa ke liye uksaane vaale ye bayaan apana asar chhod jate hai
 The first thing to talk about is Basavan Gowda Patil, MLA from Vijaypur, Karnataka BJP
 unhone kargil vijay diwas par yojit ek kaarykram main kaha ki agar ve grahamantri hote to buddhijiviyon ko goli maarane kaa aadesh de dete
 He called liberals and intellectuals as anti-nationals
 baswan gauda ke mutabik buddhijivi desh kii sari suvidhaon kaa istemaal karte hai, jiske liye janata tex detii he or uske baad bhartiya sena ke khilaaf hi narebaaji karti he
 He also said that the country is most threatened by intellectuals and secularists
 baswan gauda isse pehle bhi vivaadit bayaan de chuke hai, jab unhone parshadon se muslimon kii madad na karne kii apil kii thi
 This is the statement of the leader of Karnataka in which journalist Gauri Lankesh is shot and killed in public
 rajya police ke mutabik unki hatya main hindutvvaadi takaton kaa haath he
 Not only Karnataka, there have been attacks on intellectuals and liberals in many states of the country
 nafrat failaane ke bayanon kaa silsilaa uttar pradesh main bhi jari he
 BJP MP Hariom Pandey from Ambedkarnagar said that if the population of Muslims is not controlled then a new country like Pakistan will take shape in India
 vivaadaaspad bayaan dete rahane vaale bijepi vidhayak surinder singh bhi peeche nahin rahe
 He said that Hindus should produce five children each
 aise bayaan dene waalon main congress ke kai netaa bhi hai
 Former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor has said that if BJP wins again in 2019, India will become 'hindu Pakistan'
 ve mob liching kii ghatnaon ko lekar hindu taliban kii baat bhi kar chuke hai
 Mani Shankar Aiyar called PM Narendra Modi a low during the Gujarat elections and was suspended from the Congress
 digvajiy singh bhi gaahe-bagaahe bayanon se vivaad khadey karte hai
 Congress spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi recently used extremely derogatory words to anchor in a TV debate
 congress alaakaman ke kehane par unhone maafee maangi
 The comments enditivi ne nafrat failaane vaale bayanon kaa vishleshan kiya to pataa chalaa ki aise bayaan dene vaale adhikansh janpratinidhi or bade netaa hai
 Since 2014, there have been 130 hate speeches
 yah upie-2 ke mukaable 520 fisadi zyada hai
 BJP leaders are at the forefront of making such statements
 91 fisadi bayaan bijepi netaaon ke hai
 Out of 130 such statements since 2014, 118 are from BJP leaders
 bijepi alaakaman bhi kai baar apane saasandon or vidhayakon ko tok chukaa he
 Once, BJP President Amit Shah has reprimanded all the mps who have created problems for the party with inflammatory speeches and statements
 piem narendra modi bhi kai baar tok chuke hai
 He had said that do not spice the media by giving discourses on seeing the cameras
 iske baavjood bijepi netaaon kii bayaanbaji kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 On the other hand, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has warned party leaders for the second time within a week to desist from rhetoric
 unhone netaaon ko lakshmana rekha kii yaad dilaai he or kaha he ki jo ise laanghega uske khilaaf karrwai se party nahin hichakegi
 So why is it that despite the high command's warning, the leaders are not deterred from making inflammatory statements? And what action should be taken against hate leaders? Obviously, until such action is taken by the parties, the chain of such statements is not going to stop
 sabase pehle baat karte hai karnataka bijepi ke vijaipur se vidhayak baswan gauda patil kii
 He said in an event organized on Kargil Vijay Diwas that if he were the Home Minister, he would have ordered the intellectuals to shoot
 unhone udaarvaadiyon or buddhijiviyon ko rashtradohi qaraar diya
 According to Basavan Gowda, intellectuals use all the facilities of the country, for which the public pays tax and then shouts slogans against the Indian Army
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh ko sabase zyada buddhijiviyon or dharmanirpekshon se hi khatara he
 Basavan Gowda has also made controversial statements earlier, when he appealed to the councilors not to help the Muslims
 yah us karnataka ke netaa kaa bayaan he jis rajya main patrkaar gauri lankesh kii saream goli maar kar hatya kar di jaati he
 According to the state police, Hindutva forces are involved in his murder
 sirf karnataka hi nahin, desh ke kai rajyon main buddhijiviyon or udaarvaadiyon par hamale hue hai
 The process of spreading hate statements continues in Uttar Pradesh as well

 BJP MLA Surinder Singh, who continues to make controversial statements, also did not lag behind

 Many Congress leaders are also among those making such statements

 He has also spoken of the Hindu Taliban regarding the incidents of mob litching
 manishankar ayyar ne gujarat chunaavon ke dauraan piem narendra modi ko neech kaha tha or congress se nilambit kar die gaye the

 He apologized at the behest of the Congress high command

 91 percent of the statements are from BJP leaders
 2014 se ab tak aae aise 130 main se 118 bayaan bijepi netaaon ke hai
 The BJP high command has also stopped its mps and mlas many times
 ek baar to bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne baqayada un sab saansadon ko fatkaar lagaai thi jo bhadakaau bhaashanon or bayanon se party ke liye mushkilen khadi kar chuke hai
 PM Narendra Modi has also interrupted many times
 unhone kaha tha ki camere dekhte hi pravachan dekar media ko masala na den
 Despite this, the rhetoric of BJP leaders continues
 udhar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek hafte ke bheetar hi duusari baar party netaaon ko bayaanbaji se baj aane kii chetavanee di he
 He has reminded the leaders of Laxman Rekha and said that the party will not hesitate to take action against those who transcend it
 to aisa kyon he ki alaakaman kii chetavanee ke baavjood netaa bhadakaau bayaan dene se baaj nahin aa rahe? or nafrat failaane vaale netaaon ke khilaaf kya karrwai honi chahie? jaahir he jab tak partiyon kii ore se kadi karrwai nahin kii jaati, is tarah ke bayanon kaa silsilaa thamane vaala nahin he

 is bahupratikshit film main jon abraham, mrinal thakur, ravi kishan nora fatehi or kranti prakaash jha ne ahm kirdaar nibhaae hai
 John Abraham seems perfectly fit to play the role of a police officer but do you know that before John this film was offered to Saif Ali Khan
 deccan chronical kii ek report ke mutabik bottla house jon abraham se pehle actor saf ali khan ko ofer kii gai thi
 However, there was no coordination between him and director Nikhil Advani, due to which the film was given to John
 film bottla house kii kahani dilli ke jamiya nagar main saal 2008 main hue vivaadit encounter kii ghatana par aadhaarit he
 Deccan Chronicle quoted sources in one of its reports as saying, "yes, Saif was chosen for the role
 unhone script bhi suni thi, lekin unhone kabhi bhi aadhikarik rup se film sin nahin kii
 This is because there was no communication between him and Nikhil
 nikhil jon ke saath film satyamev jayate main kaam kar chuke hai or unhen laga ki is role ke liye jon upyukt rahenge
 So later he gave this role to John
 "jon abraham kii apakaming film bottla house kaa trailor kaaphi damdaar he or phans ise lekar kaaphi utsuk hai
 However, there is news that his excitement may come as a shock
 khabar he ki jis ghatana par film bottla house banaai gai he uske do aropiyon ne film par roak lagane kii yachika daayar kii he

 Kangana has turned down an offer of three crore rupees in one stroke
 dilli kii ek shaadi main dance karne ke liye unhen yah ofer mila tha

 yahi vajah he ki unke paas events main parform karne ke ofron kaa ambara lag gaya he

 bihar main sharabbandi ke baad na sirf aam janata chaiyn se he balki police bhi chaiyn kii banshi baja rahi he
 Crime has decreased in the state after prohibition, while road accidents have also decreased
 halaki rajya sarkaar ne purna sharabbandi kaa faisla achaanak liya lekin sarkaar ke is faisle kaa jabardast samarthan mil rahaa he
 After visiting the whole of Bihar, it becomes clear that the general public is very happy with the prohibition
 bihar main sharabbandi kaa asar sharabbandi ke khilaaf bana sakht kanoon to he hi, saath hi'aaj tak' ke sting oparationase bhi logon main kaaphi khauf he
 Police has been tightening its grip on Vinay Verma, the Congress MLA of the ruling coalition trapped in the sting operation
 unki giraftaar ke liye police lagaataar unke shikarpur sthit ghar or patna ke awaas par chhapemari kar rahi he
 The MLA had offered alcohol to Vinay Verma, MLA from Narkatiaganj, offered to drink wine in the sting till today
 un par sharabbandi kanoon ke tahat kai dhaaraon main shikarpur police thane or patliputra police thane main maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The Excise and Prohibition Department, with the help of the police, raided his residence because in the sting he said that there were many types of foreign liquor at his residence in Patna and Shikarpur
 unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki kisi ki himmat nahin ki wo unke ghar par aakar red kar sake
 However, people of the area know that mlas do not drink alcohol
 unhone kai saal pehle sharaab se tauba kar lee thi
 But he was fond of not drinking
 isi shauk ke chalate wo bhaage bhaage phir rahen hai
 Police are constantly intensifying the investigation to arrest them
 'aaj tak' se police ne maangi sting oparation kii copyis sambandh main police ne aaj tak se sting oparation kii copy bhi maangi he
 So that strong evidence can be collected against the MLA
 pashchimi champaran ke narkatiyaganj vidhansabha se congress ke tikat par jite vinay verma state fimali se aate hai
 The family of Vinay Verma, who belongs to Shikarpur State, has a lot of influence in the area
 narkatiyaganj main thana kaa naam shikarpur hai
 This station was like a check post to visit Shikarpur before independence
 jo shikarpur kii suraksha ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 Today the situation is that Shikarpur police station is constantly raiding the mla's house for his arrest
 vidhayak kii ilaake main he acchhee chhavinrkatiyaganj main vidhayak kii ilaake main acchhee chhavi he
 His entire family is political
 unke pita vidhayak the unke chachere bhai dilip verma kai baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 Another cousin has been an MP from Bettiah and younger cousin's wife has also been an MLA
 congress party bihar main mahagathbandhan sarkaar kaa hissaa he
 Despite this, there is no restriction on action against the MLA
 shikarpur thane ke esechao vinod kumaar singh ne bataaya ki vidhayak kii giraftaar ke liye tamaam prayaas kiye ja rahen hai
 However, despite raiding his residence several times, not a single bottle of liquor has been recovered
 is maamle main exiaar darj karne vaale utpaada evam madh nishedh vibhaag ke supretendent rakesh kumaar ne kaha ki vidhayak ne jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 He was called to the police station for questioning but he left
 isliye maamla zyada gambhir ho gaya or unke khilaaf exiaar darj kerani padi
 Reduction in crime The incident has sent a message to the government's drive for prohibition in Bihar
 raja ho yaa rank agar sharabbandi kanoon ke khilaaf gaye to jail janaa hi hoga
 It also does not get bail
 shikarpur thane ke aankadon par gaur karen to 2015 ke april maheene main 41 exiaar darj kii gai thim
 But in April 2016, only 30 cases have been reported
 inamen se 11 cese sharabbandi kanoon ke tahat hai
 Now it can be estimated from the recorded cases of entire Bihar how much crime has come down
 sarkaar ne shuru main kaha tha ki sharabbandi kii vajah se aparaadh main 27 pratishat kii kami ai he
 This figure may increase further
 police ko bhi mili rahatpulice ke liesharabbandike pehle shaam 6 baje se lekar raat 10 baje tak aparaadh kaa praim tim hota tha
 People used to drink and beat and riot
 lekin ab shanti he chowk chauraahey par jahaan pehle der raat tak log jamaa hokar huddang machaate the aaj shaam dhalate hi ghar ke andar chale jate hai
 Shops are open at the Chowk intersection, but buyers are rarely seen
 patna main bhi 9 baje ke baad sadake lagbhag khaali ho jaati hai
 Police is also relieved by this
 hotalon main bhi sharaab pine par pabandipatna ke panaash hotel main cameraa number 308 main ek shaadi samaaroh main aae mehmaanon ke liye sharaab pine kii vishesh vyavastha kii vajah se 7 bade vyapriyon ko jail kii hawa khaani pad rahi he
 Not only this, the police has also accused the owner of the hotel
 is tarah ke tamaam udhaaharan logon main khauf paidaa karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 100% women are happy with the decision of prohibition of alcohol, despite this, smuggling of alcohol is coming from some places
 nepal se lage khulaa border kii vajah se nepal se sate ilaako main log sharaab pikar aate hai
 The bars there are now buzzing with the people of Bihar
 nepal ke kai ilaakon main sharaab parosane kaa dhandha chal rahaa he
 Smuggling is also happening from there
 isi tarah jharkhand or uttar pradesh kii seemaa sharaabiyon ke liye nayaa thikaana ban ke ubhar rahaa he
 But despite all these oddities, the general public is very satisfied
 mahilaayein to 100 fisadi sarkaar ke is faisle se khush hai to 90 pratishat purush bhi maanate hai ki yah acha kadam he
 Side effects of alcoholism There are many side effects of alcohol
 bade-bade hotalon main hone vaali mitings ab kam ho rahi hai
 The prohibition is affecting Pertian
 yahaan tak haddi ke doctoron kaa dhandha bhi manda ho gaya he
 There has also been a decrease in patients due to reduction in accidents
 kyonki patna bypass main jitne nursing homes hai vahaan isi tarah ke marij pahunchate rahete the
 Sudden liquor ban in the state, the state government had banned domestic liquor from April 1 and the government was opening its own outlet for foreign liquor
 lekin kai jagahon par logon ne videshi sharaab kii is sarkari dukaan kaa virodh kiya or dukaan nahi khulne di
 The government then imposed full prohibition in the state on 5 April
 bina kisi ko samay die achaanak se hui is bandi se logon ko apane gharon main rakhi sharaab ko nasht karne kaa mauka tak nahin mila
 The hotel and bar restaurant in Bihar got a license to serve liquor two years ago for one year
 lekin achaanak sarkaar ke faisle se unka vyavsaay tabah ho gaya
 However, the government has asked for their license fees to be returned
 lekin jinhone infrestrechar par kharch kiya tha wo patna hoicourt main sarkaar ke khilaaf maamla darj kar virodh kar rahe hai
 It will be important to see what decision of the High Court comes in the hearing of this case on 3 May
 sharabbandi ko lekar sarkaar kis kadar gambhir he iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1 april se lekar 30 april ke bich police ne 19010 red kii
 In which 939 cases were filed against those who violated the prohibition law
 is maamle main 1291 logon ko ab tak jail bheja ja chukaa he
 The MLA and big businessmen also did not see any attitude of disrespect
 aise main aam janata main is sharabbandi ke kanoon kaa khauf to dikhegaa hi
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi many times goes through something which raises a question mark on his personality
 aamtaur par bhaashan ke dauraan netaaon kii jubaan phisalana aam baat he, lekin raajnneeti ke shikhar purushon kii jubaan phisale to kiye dhare par pani phirana laazmi he
 The word from the slipped tongue often becomes news
 aisa hi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath hua
 Rahul Gandhi gave a rushed speech in Raipur on Friday
 is dauraan unhone bijepi sarkaar, pradhanmantri modi or rajya ke siem par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He gave a speech in an aggressive style to the BJP
 rajnatik pandit maan baithe kirahulbaba ne vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul phoonk diya he, lekin jaise-jaise vakt gujara vaise hi bijepi kaa rajnatik galiyara bhi garmaane laga
 The BJP camp suddenly discovered a sentence from Rahul Gandhi's speech which is enough to question Rahul Gandhi's general knowledge
 rahul ne bijepi sarkaar se poocha BHEL se kyon nahin kharida mobilerahul gandhi ne apane andaaj main ek ke baad ek muddon par unhone bijepi, pradhanmantri modi aurachhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman sinhaper tikhaa prahaar kiya
 In the end, he teased such an issue which is now becoming a trap for him
 rahul gandhi ne mukhyamantri raman singh kii smart phone yojana ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki unhone cell phone BHEL se kyon nahin karidaa
 Not once or twice, Rahul Gandhi took the name of BHEL for mobile purchases
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf rafel ghotaalaa or is taraf cell phone ghotaalaa
 After this statement, Rahul Gandhi has come under target not only of BJP but of common voters
 soshal media main wo apane is bayaan ko lekar jamkar trol ho rahe hai
 Many Congress workers are also taking a dig at Rahul's statement
 vahiin duusari or bijepi ko baithe bithaae rahul gandhi ne ek bada mudda thama diya he
 Actually, BHEL makes heavy machinery and not cell phones
 apane bayaan par trol hue rahul gandhibijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra ne rahul gandhi ke BHEL vaale bayaan par kaha ki yah rajnatik samaj us rajaneta kii he, jo pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab dekhtaa he
 Chief Minister Raman Singh also said about Rahul Gandhi that neither he has any understanding of politics nor any knowledge about the country
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ne tanj kasate hue kaha kiraahul gandhiparty main parachute raajnneeti par lagaam lagane kii baat kehete hai, lekin ve khud parachute se congress main utre hai
 On the other hand, Chhattisgarh BJP spokesperson Srichand Sundrani said that Rahul Gandhi is neither a serious leader nor does he have a positive outlook
 kisi ne bhi unhen jo bataaya bagaiyr uski padtaal kiye wo tathy janata par lad dete hai
 Neither BHEL nor BSNL currently manufactures cell phones
 jaankaree jutaney par pataa chalaa ki donon hi companiyon kii bhavishya main cell phone nirmaan kii koi yojana bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, he would know only what BHEL company Rahul Gandhi was referring to
 philhal to ve apni is fisali jubaan ko lekar apane virodhiyon ke nishane par hai
 BJP President Rajnath Singh on Monday named Jagdish Shettar as the party's chief ministerial candidate for the state assembly elections to be held in Karnataka on May 5
 vahiin, bhaajapa ne party do saansadon ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke liye nilambit kar diya he
 He also announced that senior party leaders LK Advani and Narendra Modi will be bjp's star campaigners in the Karnataka elections
 sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali sahit kai party netaaon ke saath singh karnataka main bhaajapa ke prachaar kii shuruyaat karne ke liye aaj yahaan se bengalooru ke liye ravaanaa hue, lekin jis hawaii jahaaz se ve ja rahe the usamen kuch kharabi paidaa ho gai
 As a result, the aircraft returned after a brief flight
 baad main unhone yaheen se video conferencig ke jariye bengalooru kii sabha ko sambodhit kiya

 com / glyxng9vdm The assassination of the Russian ambassador in Turkey has been termed as a terrorist act by the leaders of Turkey and Russia
 ankara main somvaar ko andre carlov ko turki ke ek police afasar ne saream goli maar di jab wo ek art gailaree main bhaashan de rahe the
 However, the attacker was also killed after the incident
 lekin ek police afasar dwaara kisi rajdoot kii is tarah hatya kiye jane se duniyabar ke log hairaan hai
 The question arises in everyone's mind why the ambassador was killed
 
 
 sabase pehle gaur karne vaali baat he ki yah ghatana aise vakt hui he jabarus or turki ke rishtesudhar rahe hai or donon mulkon ke bich sahyog bad rahaa he
 Leaders of both countries have emphasized that this incident should not be overshadowed by the friendship between Turkey and Russia
 rus syria main chal rahe grih yuddh main raashtrapati bashar al asad kii sarkaar kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 There is tension between Turkey and Russia regarding this
 rus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin ne kaha he ki hatya kii yah ghatnauksaane vaali karrawihai
 Its purpose is to disrupt the normalizing relations between Russia and Turkey and the process of restoration of peace in Syria by Russia, Turkey, Iran and other countries
 syrian sarkaar kaa samarthan karne ke liye rus ke khilaaf istambul main rus ke vaanijya duutavas ke baahar pradarshan bhi hue hai
 But the governments of Turkey and Russia are working together on a cease-fire in Aleppo
 turki ke raashtrapati taiyap erdogan ne bhiputin ke sur main surmilaate hue kaha he ki hatyakand kaa makasad turki or rus ke saamaanya hote rishton main baadha daalana he
 But the governments of Russia and Turkey understand the plot of this provocative action well
 is ghatana kaa ek video soshal media par circulet ho rahaa he jisamen roosi rajdoot ko goli maarane ke baad hamalavar ko 'allahu akbar', 'syria ko mat bhuulo', 'aleppo ko mat bhuulo' ke naare lagaate hue suna ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that Russia is trying hard to get the Assad government back on the eastern side of Aleppo
 yahaan vidrohiyon ne kareeb chaar varshon se kabja kar rakhaa he
 In addition, Russia is the most powerful ally of the Assad government and since September 2015 has been carrying out airstrikes in all areas of Syria to strengthen the Assad government
 sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad kaa sthaayee sadsy hone ke naate syria main jari jang kaa raajnneetik tareeke se samaadhaan nikaalane kii koshishon par apane vito power kaa istemaal bhi kar chukaa he
 The assassination of the Russian ambassador comes at a time when diplomats from Turkey, Iran and Russia are about to meet in Moscow on Tuesday
 is meeting main aleppo shahar ke maujuuda halaat par charchaa honi he
 The slain ambassador Andre Karlov has been Putin's favorite
 wo roosi raashtrapati ke madhya-purv daure ke samay putin ke saath rahete the
 For the past few years, Russia has been trying to be effective even once in the Middle East
 in koshishon main carlov main ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 Russia and Turkey's relations began to get tighter since their support to Syria
 turki syria main asad ke khilaaf lard rahe vidrohiyon kaa saath de rahaa he
 In such a situation, it seems that the attacker may be part of the society which is angry with Russia's action in Syria

 Maken said that Kejriwal's dharna to the Lieutenant Governor's house was done by the Lieutenant Governor's bhagat, as the dharna drama was beneficial for both the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party
 maakan ne kaha ki dharna kejariwal ko suut karata he, kyonki kejariwal ne chunaav ke samay jo vaadein kiye the vah khokhalen nikle

 unhone match se pehle ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ''main hameshaa paanch gendbaajon ke saath khilne ke paksh main rahaa hum kyonki agar ham zyada ballebaajon ke saath khelen to ham test main 700 bana sakate hai lekin usase phir bhi madad nahin milti
 You have to take 20 wickets to win a Test match
 isliye wicket keeper ke alaava hamaare sheersh paanch ballebaajon ko jimmedaari uthaani hogi or ek bada score khadaa karnaa hoga taaki ham unhen do baar out kar saken
 '' Comments kohli ne kaha, ''agar hamen bada score khadaa karne kii jarurat ho to bhi hamen itane ran banane honge ki hamen duusari baar batting karne kii jarurat naa pade
 This is what we have been thinking for the last two seasons and we want to start the series with the same thinking that our bowling is strong enough to take 20 wickets
 '' (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said in a press conference before the match, "I have always been in favor of playing with five bowlers because if we play with more batsmen then we can make 700 in the Test but it still doesn't help
 aapako test match jeetne ke liye 20 wicket lene hote hai
 So apart from the wicket-keeper, our top five batsmen have to take responsibility and put up a big score so that we can dismiss them twice
 ''tippaniyan Kohli said, "even if we need to score big, we still have to score so many runs that we don't have to bat for the second time
" pichley do sijan se hamaari yahi soch rahi he or ham usee soch ke saath siries kii shuruyaat karnaa chaahate hai ki hamaari gendbaaji 20 wicket lene ke hisaab se paryaapt rup se majboot ho

 Arvind Kejriwal, who specializes in shooting arrows on political faces on the issue of corruption, has targeted the country's big industrialist Mukesh Ambani and his company RIL this time
 aariel va sarkaar kii mileebhagaravind kejariwal ne khulaasa kiya he ki reliance indrustries limited or sarkaar kii mileebhagat ke kaaran hi gas ke daam betahasha bad gaye hai
 Kejriwal alleged that Reliance is constantly being arbitrary and bigotry
 unhone kaha ki aisa lag rahaa he ki desh ko manmohan singh nahin, balki mukesh ambani chalaa rahe hai
 Audio tape of narrated Neera Radia: Kejriwal first delivered the audio tape of Neera Radia and Ranjan Bhattacharya at the press conference, then fired fiercely on his behalf
 gauratlab he ki ranjan bhattacharya purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke damaad hai
 Wrong use of contract: Arvind Kejriwal said that in the year 2000, the NDA government gave a contract to Reliance to extract gas from the KG basin
 ummid thi ki reliance zyada se zyada gas nikaalegi, lekin reliance ne jamkhori karnaa shuru kar diya
 Kejriwal alleged that Reliance repeatedly negotiated with the government on the price of gas, using the contract incorrectly
 reliance ko pahunchaaya gaya phaydatim kejariwal ne kaha ki aaj reliance ke 31 main se keval 13 kuen hi kaam kar rahe hai
 He said that Mukesh Ambani's company had a profit of 1 lakh crore while being the Petroleum Minister of Murali Deora
 kejariwal ne kaha ki yah ghotaalaa ekadam koyala ghotaale jaisaa hi he
 'murali Deora Man of Reliance' Arvind Kejriwal accused Murali Deora of being a man of Reliance
 unhone kaha, ‘jo manishankar ayyar ne reliance ke liye nahin kiya, wo murali devda ne kiya
 The CAG said that it is a single tender contract
 reliance ne sabhi sazosaman ek hi company se kharide hai
 We want to investigate this deal
 hoicourt ke faisle kaa diya hawalakejariwal ne mumbai hoicourt ke us faisle kaa hawala diya, jisamen court ne kaha he ki reliance kaa rate zyada he or company munafa bhi zyada kama rahi he
 Kejriwal said, 'reliance has given NTPC 4
 25 dollar main gas dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin pehle ise 6
 25 dollars and then 14
 25 dollar
 He questioned why the burden should be passed on to the customers
 arvind ne bataaya, ‘deal tay hui thi ki 8 karod unit gas nikaala jayega lekin 1 saalon ke baad bhi keval 3 karod unit gas hi nikaali gai he
 This clearly means that Reliance is hoarding gas and NTPC will get this gas only when its price is 14
 25 dollar prati unit ho jaaegi
 Kejriwal asked for a reply from the Prime Minister, Kejriwal asked a sharp question to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that despite all this, why are they silent? He sought answers from the Prime Minister that why his attitude towards Reliance is soft? Kejriwal told, 'gas price 14
 25 dollar prati unit karne ke maamle ko lekar rilanyas jaipal reddy se mila lekin wo nahin maane
 Reliance also met the Group of Ministers and they did not agree
 lekin pradhanmantri anicchhuk dikhe or unhone atarni general se raay maangane kii baat kahi
 Mukesh Ambani became unhappy with Jaipal Reddy in this episode and Reddy was removed
 pradhanmantri to arthshaastri hai to unhen kya ho rahaa he isaki bhalee-bhaanti samaj he
 They are stuck because they have signed papers related to coal allocation to Reliance
 ab in sab maamalon kii lipapoti karne ke liye unhen or bhi kagajaton par dastakhat karne padenge
 Moily is brought to the ministry because he is 14
 25 dollar prati unit par raji ho sakate hai or phir iske baad reliance congress ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bada fund degi
 Kejriwal told the people that 'they want cheap electricity and gas, they have to come down on the rebellion, because the government is committing corruption with the industrial houses

 rigerv bank of india ne bank khaaton ko lekar nayaa prastaav pesh kiya he
 According to this new proposal of RBI, now people can change their bank without changing the account number
 agar yah prastaav paas hota he to mobile number portability ke baad bank acount portability bhi sambhav ho sakegi
 It is clear that after all bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar card, it is now possible to switch accounts from one bank to another
 jo ki bank khaataa dharakon ke liye kaaphi raahat bharaa faisla ho saktaa he
 RBI says that in recent times, the use of technology in banking system has increased continuously, due to which these things have become very easy
 yahi kaaran he ki ab mobile number portability kii tarah hi bank khaataa bhi portable kiya ja saktaa he
 Advantages of this portability If you are dissatisfied with your bank, are upset with the services offered by it, then you can change the bank without changing your bank account number
 lihaaja, ab baar-baar bank acount badalane par aapako nayaa acount number nahin lenaa hoga
 After bank account portability, you can also get rid of more than one bank account number problem
 is suvidha ke baad bainkon par dabaav padegaa ki vah graahakon ko di ja rahi suvidha main sudhaar karen nahin to graahak apana bank acount lekar kisi duusare bank main ja saktaa he
 Will banks be ready for portability? It will not be easy to give portability to bank account number
 is disha main badhane ke liye bainkon ko apane data ko online karte hue technology integration kii disha main aage badanaa hoga
 It is possible that banks may have to make major changes in the existing process of giving unique bank accounts to their account holders

 Ajay Devgan reaches out to his ex-wife and children with this young companion

 The first half makes some laughs but in the second half it seems that the director does not understand how to contain the raita that he has spread

 The screenplay is also very bad
 agar acting ke morche par khangale to rakul preet singh (rakul Preet Singh) dil jeetne main kaamyaab rahati hai
 The film's life is Rakul Preet Singh and whenever she comes on screen, the face of the audience flashes

 Right now my focus is on Maharashtra elections
 darasal, aisi khabaren thi ki congress netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya or congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bich mangalvaar ko hone vaali mulaakaat radd ho gai
 Earlier it was being claimed that after the ongoing dispute between the Chief Minister Kamal Nath and supporters of Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh about the new party president in the state, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday and Wednesday Delhi was called for the meeting
 daawa kiya ja rahaa tha ki congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi jald se jald netaaon ke bich vivaad suljhaana chaahati hai
 In fact, Sonia Gandhi wants a state president of the party in Madhya Pradesh who has the support of both Kamal Nath and Scindia, but it is not yet seen

 Jyotiraditya Scindia's supporters are now coming forward

 Dangi said, "some leaders of the Congress state unit are not able to digest Scindia's popularity and are conspiring to keep him out of Madhya Pradesh
" " kai log maanate hai ki yah sab sindhiya kii sahmati se hua
 Jyotiraditya Scindia is in the race himself
 haalanki unhone yah khud nahin kaha he lekin unke samarthakon ne isaki maang karne vaale poster lagava die hai
 However, Digvijay Singh, another center in state politics, is opposed to the appointment of Jyotiraditya Scindia as Congress state president, making Kamal Nath's job easier

 didi ne shart keval itani rakhi he ki kaam 'constructive' hona chahie or sabhi virgon ke liye hona chahie
 However, Mamata Banerjee has thrown a dice of support towards the Modi government at a time when she does not need any party's support in the Lok Sabha in terms of numbers
 jahaan tak rajyasabha kii baat he, isamen TMC ke saansad kisi bill ke paas hone ke vakt samarthan dekar kaaphi madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai
 PM Narendra Modi himself has said in Parliament that his government intends to take all parties together, whether it is big or small

 The Election Commission has banned the speech of many leaders, including Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BSP President Mayawati, due to the spoils in the Lok Sabha elections

 chunaav ayog ke teen dinon ke bain ko yogi adityanath ne behatar dhang se istemaal karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 Yogi has found such a jugaad that he is also giving political messages and the Election Commission is unable to do anything

 That is why Yogi Hanuman is seen in devotion

 After this, on the second day of the ban, Yogi arrived at Hanumangarhi in Ayodhya on Wednesday
 itnaa hi nahin, bain ke tisare din unhone banaras main kaashi vishwanath mandir or sankatmochan ke darshan karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 Explain that due to the ban, Yogis can neither rally, nor can they make any rhetoric related to political meetings and elections
 chunaav ayog ne unhen soshal media ke istemaal se bhi roak rakhaa he
 Due to this, Yogi has found a way on which BJP can get more political benefits if Election Commission bans
 chunaav ayog kii pabandi ke baad yogi puri tarah bajrang bali kii sharan main najar aa rahe hai
 After Lucknow and Ayodhya, Yogi is reaching Varanasi, the parliamentary seat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Thursday
 yogi banaras main kaashi vishwanath ke darshan karne ke baad sankatmochan mandir main puja-archana karenge
 Apart from this, Yogi will also visit the Dom Raja's door in Benaras

 ‘do nyaay agar to aadha do, But, even if there is a barrier, to de do keval paanch gram, Keep all your soil ham vahiin khushi se khaayenge, The family will not take up any trouble! Duryodhana could not even give that, ashish samaaj kii le na sakaa, On the contrary, went to bind Hari, jo tha asaadhya, saadhane chalaa
 When there is an umbrella on the destroyer Manuj, pehle vivek mar jaataa he
 Hari shouted fiercely, apana swaroop-vistaar kiya, Dagmag-dagmag bhagavan kupit hokar bole- 'help me by raising the chain haan, haan duryodhana! band mujhe

 sutron ke hawaale se khabar aa rahi he ki haryana janhit congress kaa bijepi se gathbandhan tuutane ja rahaa he
 According to sources, Haryana Janhit Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi can announce it in Chandigarh on Thursday
 jald hi haryana main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai or mana ja rahaa he donon partiyon main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar baat nahin ban saki
 There are 90 assembly seats in Haryana
 haryana janhit congress 45 siton kii maang kar rahi thi, jabaki bijepi 18 siten hi dene ke liye raji he
 It is notable that earlier this month, Haryana Janhit Congress had asked the BJP to clarify the situation on the alliance for the assembly elections
 darasal bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki unke party kaaryakartaaon ko apane bal par haryana main jeet sunishchit karne par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 After this statement by Amit Shah, Kuldeep Bishnoi had said that BJP should clarify its stand on the issue very soon and said that his party (HJC) is capable of contesting all 90 seats
 unhone kaha, ‘enaies patiala ne mere pita ke laapata olympic blager ke liye laapata saamaan report chaar agast ko darj kii lekin 36 padakon or 120 durlabh tasveeron kaa koi zikr nahin he
 This information is to be filled as if a SIM card or i card has been lost

 ) The great gatekeepers of Mahadev are those idols of strength and devotion, without whose command, Mahadev is not seen
 big bul mandir main 15 feet ke vishalkay nandi maujuud hai
 On entering the temple, the eyes of the devotees keep staring intently at that giant statue
 nandi bhole ke dwarpal hai, jinaki ichha ke bina bhakthi ke dwaar nahin khulte
 shiva-shankar does not meet anyone without Nandi's will
 yahi vajah he ki har shiv mandir ke baahar unki murti jarur rahati he or unke darshan karke hi bhakt shiv mandir main pravesh karte hai
 Nandi is a symbol of devotion and power and one such huge form of power is seen in Big Bull temple
 bangalore ke basavangudi main bul temple road par big bul mandir he, jahaan pravesh karte hi bhakton kii ankhen khuli kii khuli rah jaati hai
 As soon as entering here, the huge statue of Nandi welcomes the devotees of Mahadev and brings the request of the devotees of Bhole Bhandari to them
 vaise to mahadev ke har mandir ke baahar nandi virajman rahete hai or unki ajna lekar hi bhakt mandir main pravesh karte hai, lekin big bul mandir main naam ke hi anuroop nandi kii ek hi pathar kii kaali rang kii vishalkay pratimaa maujuud he, jo 15 feet oonchi or kareeb 20 feet chaudee he or jo dur-dur se aane vaale bhakton ke liye khaas aaksharn kaa kendra hoti he
 The area is named Basavanagudi after the name of Big Bull Temple, because in the local language Basavan means bull and Gudi means temple
 hindu dharm main bul ko nandi se jodakar hi dekha jaataa he, jiske kaaran is mandir kaa naam big bul rakhaa gaya
 It is believed that this temple built in the sixteenth century was founded by Bangalore founder Kempi Gounda
 is mandir main puja va shringaar ke anokhe vidhi vidhaan hai, yahaan makkhan se nandi kaa abhishek kiya jaataa he
 It is said that about 100 kg of butter is used in this makeup, which the devotees are happy to see
 subah savere 6 baje mandir aam bhakton ke liye khol diya jaataa he or raat 8 baje tak khulaa rahata he
 It is said that whoever comes here never returns empty handed
 mahadev bigade kaam banaate hai or bhakton par khushiyaan lutaate hai
 That is why crowds of devotees flock to see this beautiful form of Shiva with Nandi
 is mandir kaa naam big bul rakhane ke peeche bhi ek kahani he
 Once Mahadev embraces him, never leave him
 jis par aughaddani kii krupa barasati he wo ajar-amar ho jaataa he
 The devotee of Shiva, his vehicle Nandi has something similar as well, only if there is any Shivala or a temple, Nandi is seen everywhere with the Shiva family
 lekin big bul mandir main nandi kii bhakthi or unki shakti kii ek alag hi kahani dekhne or sunne ko milti he
 There is a mythological belief behind the establishment of this temple
 kaha jaataa he ki kai sau saal pehle is mandir ke aas-paas badi sankhya main nariyal kii kheti kii jaati thi
 But once a wild bull created a ruckus in the whole area, he entered the fields and destroyed the entire coconut cultivation
 tabhi gussaye hue ek kisaan ne ek danda se us par hamalaa kar diya or dekhte-dekhte chamatkaar ho gaya or wo bail ek kaale rang kii pathar kii pratimaa main badal gaya
 Locals say that the size of the bull was constantly increasing in the black statue, then to stop its increasing size, the trident was installed in the bull's forehead in the form of Mahadev, which stopped the bull's size increasing
 Gone
 yaheen par baad main kempi gaunda ne shivlinga kii sthapana kar mandir kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 With the establishment of this temple, the tradition of offering coconut started here, which is still being carried out in its original form
 har saal november-disambar ke maheene main yahaan nariyal meley kaa aayojan hota he jab mandir ke baahar sadak ke donon ore nariyal kii badi-badi dukaane saj jaati hai
 In the common language, this fair is called Kadalakavi Parishe
 manyata he ki jab is mandir kaa nirmaan hua tab vahaan ke kisaanon ne nariyal chadhaane kii parampara shuru kii thi, jo guzarate samay ke saath badhati chali gai
 Even today there are many farmers who offer the first part of their crop in the temple and this faith of the devotees has taken the form of a fair today
 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri banane ja rahe hai
 The question is, what other ministers will be in his government? enditivi india ko sutron se pataa chalaa he ki patpadganj vidhansabha seat se jite manish sitaudiya kaa mantri bananaa tay he
 Apart from him, Saurabh Bhardwaj won from Greater Kailash and Vinod Kumar Binny from Laxminagar can also be included in the cabinet

 landan ke central haul westminster main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ‘bharat kii baat sabake saath’ kaarykram main desh kii badhati takat ke bare main bataaya
 Referring to the surgical strike, the PM said that India will not tolerate terrorism
 unhone pakistan kaa naam liye bina kaha ki aatank kaa niryaat karne waalon ko modi usee kii bhashaa main jawaab dena jaanata he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the surgical strikes carried out across the Line of Control in 2016, two years ago, to target those who set up terror factories
 unhone kaha ki bharat aatankwaad kaa niryaat karne waalon ko bardaasht nahin karegaa
 Will give them a befitting reply
 modi ne kaha ki kisi ne aatank ke niryaat kii factory laga lee ho or ham par peeche se hamale kii koshishen karata ho to modi usee bhashaa main jawaab dena jaanata he
 India has changed, the old-fashioned way is no longer tolerable
 When a man sitting in the spectator gallery of Westminster Hall questioned the surgical attacks, Modi replied that those who like the export of terror, i want to tell them that India has changed And their old ways will not be tolerated
 unhone kaha ki ham shanti main yakeen rakhte hai, lekin ham aatank kaa niryaat karne waalon ko bardaasht nahin karenge
 We will give them a befitting reply and in the same language that they understand
 aatankwaad kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya jayega
 Regarding the surgical strike first told Pakistan, the Prime Minister said that she was proud of the army, because she carried out the surgical strikes with precision and returned before completing her work before dawn
 modi ne bataaya ki kaise bharat ne hamalon ke bare main pehle pakistan ko suchit kiya or phir media evam logon ko bataaya
 He said that we had been calling Pakistan since 11 o'clock, but they were also afraid of coming on the phone
 12 baje hamane unase baat kii or tab bhartiya media ko bataaya gaya
