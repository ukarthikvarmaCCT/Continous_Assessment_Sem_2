 is samay rajendra paal gautam dilli main jal mantralay sambhaal rahe hai lekin kejariwal ke khud ye mantralay sanbhaalane se saafe he ki rajendra paal gautam ke kaam se kejariwal santusht nahin
 Before Rajendra Pal Gautam, Kapil Mishra was the water minister, who was removed from the cabinet in May 2017, pleading that he was not working properly, there were many complaints
 haalanki ye daleel kisi ke gale nahin utari
 Before Kapil Mishra, Manish Sisodia took over this ministry and Sheila Dixit himself used to handle this ministry while being the CM in Delhi
 2012 main kejariwal ne raajnneeti kii shuruyaat hi bijli pani jaise muddon ko uchhaalkar kii thi
 As soon as he came to power in 2013, he announced to make 20,000 liters of water free every month and the Aam Aadmi Party's election promise to provide clean drinking water to every house in Delhi was also fulfilled, which Kejriwal himself seems to fulfill Will have to handle the ministry
 mana ja rahaa he ki jald hi kejariwal rajendra paal gautam se ye mantralay apane paas le lenge
 In 2012, Kejriwal started politics only by raising issues like electricity and water
 2013 main satta main aate hi har maheene 20,000 litre pani har maheene muft karne kaa elaan kiya tha or dilli ke har ghar main pine kaa saaf pani pahunchane kaa aam aadmi party kaa chunavi vaada bhi tha jisko puraa karne ke liye bhi lagata he kejariwal ko khud ke mantralay sanbhaalanaa hoga
 It is believed that soon Kejriwal will take this ministry from Rajendra Pal Gautam
 Ok so it had to come to this

 The High Court gave this decision while hearing a case related to mental and physical torture

 Immediately after marriage, the wife insisted on removing the in-laws from the house
 vah 70 saal kii saas ko bhi ghar main rakhane ko raji nahin thi
 Also, she started asking husband for three thousand rupees every month to decorate and move around
 manaa karne par mahila ne pati, saas or anya parivaar waalon se marpet shuru kar di
 After this, the husband decided to live with only wife separated from his family
 lekin uske sasuralwaalon ne use ek baar bandhak tak bana liya

 23 may ko aae loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguwai main bijepi or endie ne itihaas rach diya
 In the election, the BJP and NDA coalition won the best ever by winning 343 seats and won an overwhelming majority
 is chunaav main bijepi hi nahin, endie ke ummidavaar bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naam par hi vot maang rahe the or khud pradhanmantri modi bhi matadaataaon se yahi kah rahe the ki logon kaa ek ek vot unako hi jane vaala he
 Now the question arises that why and how did BJP and NDA get such a huge majority, on which issues? In such a situation, we are telling you the 8 big reasons for this historic victory which overturned the election and put PM Modi once again on the highest post of Indian democracy
 modi kaa jaandaar or prabhaavshaalee vaktaa honapradhanmantri narendra modi jis tarah se desh ke karodon karod logon se sidhaa naata jod lete hai, wo samvaad adaayagi kisi or netaa main nahin he
 To hold four to five electoral meetings in a day and that too with full enthusiasm
 isse logon par itnaa prabhaav padaa ki logon ne modi ko apana maseehaa chun liya
 Breaking the caste bond, connecting with work Opposition parties formed several alliances from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka to Maharashtra
 lekin vipaksh ke in gathbandhanon par modi kaa naam baari padaa
 In fact, in front of the parties that equate votes in the name of caste, people trusted Prime Minister Modi's plans more
 ek raily main mayawati ne piem modi ko nakli pichhadaa, kaha to piem modi ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki ab reliyon main modi kii jati par baat hoti he
 To create a new atmosphere of nationalism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has raised the slogan of nationalism in almost all his election rallies
 har sabha main rashtrawaad ke mudde ko jinda rakhaa
 He managed to tell the people that his government was four steps ahead in taking tough measures against terrorists
 pradhanmantri kii is chhavi ne chunaav main unako bharpoor phayda pahunchaaya
 In response to the Pulwama incident, the martyrdom of 40 CRPF personnel in the Balakote Airstrike Pulwama terror attack shook India

 ’ Manohar Parrikar will complete one year as Chief Minister in March 2018, but he is already seen wandering the path

 This had not happened in his three previous tenures
 log maanate hai ki mukhyamantri centre or sahyogi dalon ke dabaav kii keemat chukaa rahe hai
 It is December 11
 mukhyamantri vidhayakon ko ek prajentation de rahe the
 In this, he tried his best to assure his listeners that the Center's plans to nationalize Goa's rivers and increase the coal carrying capacity of the Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) were in the state's interest
 par ve naakaam rahe
 Local people are strongly opposing both these projects for nationalization of rivers and increasing coal carrying capacity, while Nitin Gadkari is giving a lot of emphasis to them
 udhar activist bataa rahe hai ki kendriya parivahan mantralay apni rashtriya jalmaarg pariyojna ke hisse ke taur par jis tarah chapora, saal, mapusa, pomburpa, mandovi or juaari nadiyon ke istemaal kaa mansuba bana rahaa he, usase in nadiyon par rajya kaa adhikaar khatm ho jayega or aakhirkaar iskaa asar machhlee pakadaaey par padegaa—jo goa kaa teesraa sabase bada udhyam he
 On the other hand, 60 gram sabhas have opposed the lifting of more coal citing environmental concerns
 jaankaron kii raay main, khud parrikar bhi maanate hai ki ye donon prastaav goa ke hiton ke khilaaf hai
 But these insiders say that Chief Minister Gadkari owes his favor, who played a key role in mobilizing the support of Goa Forward Party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and three Independent mlas after the BJP failed to win a clear majority in the assembly elections last year
 By paying, Parrikar had cleared the way to become Chief Minister again
 jaahir he, mukhyamantri majaboor hai
 He was "not present" in response to several attempts by India Today to contact him, but Parrikar said in Panaji, "the work has been done to notify the six rivers of Goa as national waterways from the Center
 nadiyon ko jahajrani or nauvahan ke liye khol diya gaya he
 It is not nationalization of rivers
 " pataa chalaa he ki sarkaar empiti or antardeshiy jalmaarg praadhikaran ke saath sahmati patron par dastakhat kii taiyaari main he

 iske sanyukt mahasachiv olonshio simons kehete hai ki sthaneey machuaaron kii kareeb 70 fisadi machhliyaan antardeshiy jalmargon se aati hai
 But Parrikar says that even if Goa refuses to sign the mous, the Center will still implement the National Waterways Act
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se kaha, ''mujhase chand todakar laane kii maang mat kiijie
 "at the same time, he also argued that the state does not have the resources to clean the sediment of its silt-laden rivers
 tajjub kii baat yah he ki goa ke pradooshan niyantran board ne empiti ke khilaaf aapraadhik shikaayat darj karai he, jisamen manjuur kshamta se zyada koyala nikaalane ke liye bandargah ke afasaron par karrwai kii maang kii gai he
 However the MPT has denied the allegations

 This debt is equivalent to 20 per cent of the state's GDP and is dangerously approaching the 23 per cent upper limit
 ab parrikar ke dost bhi unka daaman chhod rahe hai
 Claude Alvares, director and environmentalist of the Goa Foundation, is of the opinion that Parrikar is "working under external pressures from mining companies investing money in the bjp's election campaign
" " alvares kehete hai, ''main to un par (parrikar) se bharosa kho chukaa hum
 “the increasing seizure of drug consignments is another embarrassing issue for Parrikar
 grih mahakme ko tab khaasaa nicha dekhnaa padaa jab unhen rajya ke number 2 ipies afasar bimal kumaar gupta ko ghoosekhori ke aaropon ke baad hataanaa padaa

 The government wants to memorialize the last session of the 14th Lok Sabha starting today

 haalanki unhone ye bhi mana ki 14veen loksabhaa ki viraasat to bas hangaamaa hi rahi
 Actually, the issue of Telangana has become a bone in the throat of the government
 ek ore telugana to duusari or simandhra
 The last two sessions have been the result of uproar
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki sarkaar hi apane saansadon ko kaabo main nahin kar rahi
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said that the BJP will raise the issue of murder of a student from North East in Delhi to the Farmers Insurance Scheme
 haalanki sansadeey kaarymantri kamalnath to ek baar phir telugana ke 17 or andhra ke 25 saansadon ko dar abhi se hi dikhaane lage hai jo agali loksabhaa main chun kar aane vaale hai
 Kamal Nath said that if the Telangana bill is not passed even in this session then what is the guarantee of peace in the next Lok Sabha also
 haalanki, sarkaar kii mushkil yaheen nahin kam ho rahi hai
 Be it Mulayam or Left, Sharad Yadav or BJD, they all have formed their own front and obviously the front will open against the government in this session
 yani ek baar phir hangaamen ke hi asaar ban hai

 Walter E
 of America washington kanvension centre ke sabhaagaar main jab raushnee maddhim hui or sir ke thik upar lage vishaal parade par film chalani shuru hui, to pradhanmantri narendra modi samet 50 rajdhyakshon kii nigaah ek saath vahaan ja tiki
 All of these leaders gathered in Washington DC to participate in the fourth nuclear security conference on 1 April
 isse thik pehle america raashtrapati baraak obama ne sabhaagaar se media ko baahar bhej diya tha or vahaan maujuud netaaon ko suchit kiya tha ki yah film aatankwaadiyon dwaara ek sambhavit parmaanu hamale or uske baad paidaa hone vaali sthitiyon kaa akalan karne ke liye banaai gai he
 Watching the film was like taking part in a war-based video game where the leaders had to react to the impending nuclear attack
 film ke ek drishy par sabhi kaa munh khulaa kaa khulaa rah jaataa he jab aatankwaadi crop duster uda rahe hote hai or chikitsa sansthaanon se praapt jaanaleva radiodharmee padaarth kaa chhidkaav ek saghan rihaishi ilaake par karte hai jisase logon main bhayanak beemaari failati he or unki maut ho jaati he
 The film ends with a mild message of how the world must deal with terrorists who intend to attack the public at large using radioactive materials, as anticipated in the film
 ek radiological disprsal divaais (radiodharmee padaarth failaane vaala upkaran) yaa lokapriy bhashaa main kahen to darty bam yaa shaitani bam ke ghatak vahi isotope hote hai jinase cancer kaa ilaaj hota he or blad transfusion sambhav hota he
 When these isotopes are mixed with explosives and released near an urban center, the explosion causes the people living nearby
 visphot ke baad isse hone vaala radiodharmee utsarjan do varg kilometre ke daayre main bhayankar bimaariyaan failaa detaa he-yah dilli ke conot place jitna bada ilaaka ho saktaa he-jisase hajaaron log bimariyon kii chapet main aa sakate hai
 This leaves radioactive remains active in the area behind it
 isse bhi buree baat yah he ki ukt ilaake ko barason tak gher kar rakhaa jaataa he jab tak ki aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log suraksha kavach pahanakar us ilaake ko sankraman se puri tarah saaf nahin kar dete
 This will be a nuclear destruction that this world cannot afford
 aise kisi bhi hamale ke kai baras baad tak iske manovaigyanik, rajnatik or aarthik parinaamon ko mahasoos kiya jaataa rahegaa
 a senior Indian official present during the film in the auditorium told India Today that Modi was among the first leaders to comment after the film was over
 unhone kaha, “aatankwaadiyon ko aise jansanhaarak hathiyaaron ke istemaal se rokane kaa iklauta tarika he antarrashtriya sahyog or karrwai, jisamen soochna or khufia jaankariyon kaa aadan-pradaan shaamil ho tathaa khatre se nibatane ke liye bade paimaane par maanav sansaadhan ko taiyaar kiya ja sake
 "all the leaders who spoke after Modi, all of them had to say in one voice that collective action is the only way to fight what Obama has described as" one of the biggest challenges before the world "
 mumbai, paris or haal main brussels or lahore main hue hamale is baat kaa saaf sanket hai ki aatankwaadi ab kahin zyada bade or chaunkaane vaale hamalon kii firaaq main hai
 The urgency of this concern was clearly felt at the conference
 aatankwaadiyon kaa kisi parmaanu hamale kaa khatra kitna gambhir he, iskaa pataa antarrashtriya parmaanu urja agency (ieie) dwaara jutai gai soochnaaon se chalata he jinhen parmaanu or radiodharmee tatwon ke ek insident and trephiking databes (itedibi) main sammilit kiya gaya he
 The latest data are available as of December 31, 2014, according to which the ITDB has reported a total of 2,734 confirmed cases of related criminal activity, including unauthorized ownership and theft of sensitive nuclear material and radioactive sources from 1993 to this date
 ieie kaa akalan he, “itedibi main darj ghatnaayen dikhaati hai ki parmaanu or anya radiodharmee samagriyon kii taskari ho rahi he or inaki chori, laapata hone or anya anadhikarik harkaton jaisi samasyaayein badhati ja rahi hai
 "the threat of nuclear terrorism is real from India's point of view and now it is no more than a mere fantasy
 masalan, bharat ke paas vishaal parmaanu suvidhaayen hai jisaki kshamta vyapak he-parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa nirmaan (bharat ke paas philhal 120 parmaanu hathiyaar hai), bijli paidaa karne vaale 22 riector, jinamein kuch hathiyaaron ke liye parmaanu saamagree bhi paidaa karte hai, radiodharmee kachare kaa vishaal jakhira (jal chukaa eendhan) jise vishisht bhandaaran kshetron main rakhaa gaya he or 7,000 se zyada santhaan jo radiodharmee upkarnon kaa prayog karte hai, jinamein khaskar nidaan (eks-re) or upachaar (cancer) karne vaale aspataal shaamil hai
 Although most of the nuclear complexes are under strict surveillance and the agencies monitoring the movement of nuclear material in the country are sufficiently competent, yet this concern is constantly increasing because terrorists are now getting more subtle methods to break into these institutions and facilities
 And they are not easily caught
 aatankwaadi bharat or baaki duniya main teen mukhya tareekon se nabhikeey hamale kar sakate haveparmaanu bam kaa visphot-yaa to kisi rajya ke jakhire se churaayaa gaya hathiyaar ho yaa phir hathiyaaron ke liye taiyaar kii gai parmaanu saamagree kii taskari se banaaya gaya koi parmaanu upkaran
 Attack on any major nuclear facility so that a large amount of lethal radiation can be emitted from there and bring destruction
 kisi shahari centre main ek shaitani bam yaa radiological disprsal divaais kaa visphot
 How safe is the Indian nuclear establishment? It is very difficult for terrorists in India to steal nuclear weapons or to smuggle and make bombs from nuclear weapons complexes (DAE) campuses into radioactive material
 bharat ke parmaanu hathiyaar kathith taur par desh bhar main alag-alag thikaanon par rakhe hue hai or inhen kancreet ke majboot kavach ke bheetar rakhaa gaya he jo kisi shatru desh ke parmaanu hamale yaa bunker todane vaali missile se surakshit he
 These locations are under tremendous surveillance and even very few people have access to them
 bharat ne pehle hamalaa na karne kaa siddhant apanaaya hua he (jiskaa matlab yah hua ki duusare desh ke aise hamale ke baad hi bharat apni ore se parmaanu hamalaa karegaa), isliye yah vyapak jakhira ekadam surakshit or aisi anjaan jagahon main rakhaa gaya he jis par jabardast nigaraanee or paharaa he
 If ever the risk of war is greatly increased, only then will they be combined with missiles
 bharat main kaman or niyantran kii vyavastha kaaphi chust he jo sidhe pradhanmantri (jinke paas nirdesh dene kaa code maujuud he) or rashtriya suraksha parishad tak jaati he, jo sabhi parmaanu hathiyaaron kii awajahi par niyantran rakhti he
 This system is very tight and works under the cover of secrecy
 isamen sarkaar ke duusare vibhaag bhi send nahin laga sakate, aatankwaadiyon kii to baat hi chhod den jinaki manshaa in tak pahunchane kii ho sakati he
 This is equally applicable to all nuclear complexes across the country where nuclear material for weapons is manufactured and bombs are made
 yah kaam karne vaali do ahm agenciyaan hai-bhabha parmaanu anusandhan centre (bark) jo nabhikeey centre banaata he or raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan (diardio), jo visphotak banaata he or inke parivahan ke liye misile taiyaar karata he
 The premises of these institutions are protected by a "defense in depth" system, where fences, barriers and many levels of security exist, due to which it is almost impossible to break into them
 yah baat alag he ki bharat ke ahm raksha santhaan ab bhi suraksha ke maamle main kamjor hai or vahaan zyada tagdi suraksha kii darkaar he, jaisaa ki haal hi main pathankot airbase par hue aatanki hamale ke dauraan dekhne main aayaa he
 Are India's nuclear power plants safe enough? Stealing the bomb is almost impossible, but the one danger that cannot be ignored is that terrorists can actually make a satanic bomb and for that make nuclear material or harmful weapons
 Radioactive material can be stolen from India's nuclear complexes
 jaisaa ki duniya bhar ke parisaron main hota he, aisa koi bhi khatra “aantarik” hi hota he-yani andar ke karmchaariyon kii vah baari sankhya, jo in sansthaanon main kaam karti he or jiske paas suvidhaon, padaarthon or tamaam tarah samvedansheel soochnaaon tak aadhikarik pahunch hoti he
 At the global conference held last week, it was said in this context that all countries should strengthen their staff monitoring, which is more than on-site monitoring, which can be assured to be absolutely safe

 The man has not been caught so far, but investigations have revealed that the outside contractor who was approved to investigate the plant went to fight ISIS two years ago
 doel-4 kii ghatana main haalanki ise sandigdh nahin mana ja rahaa he, lekin yah chintaa kaa vishay he ki ek sambhavit jehadi avashya tha jisaki pahunch plant ke samvedansheel kshetron tak thi
 This fear was further exacerbated when it was found that some ISIS men involved in the recent Brussels attack had a several-hour spy video made in November 2015 at the home of a senior officer of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center, where There was a sufficient amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU), which could be used to make nuclear explosives

 Rajagopalan recommends that a separate security force be created for nuclear institutions to strengthen the security of India's nuclear institutions and it is not easy to penetrate

 Terrorists can steal sensitive information by doing so, as recently seen at a nuclear plant in South Korea, where employees' personal information and premises are hacked

 In recent years, important preventive measures have been taken to ensure that radioactive waste is not misused

 This prevents the storage of plutonium which can become an important target of terrorists
 baaki ke teen fisadi radiodharmee kachare ko thos shakl dekar gumbadon ke bheetar 40 saal tak thanda kiya jaataa he, uske baad niyantrit kshetron main uskaa nistaaran kiya jaataa he
 India has currently closed its only HEU power plant, as part of measures to prevent the storage of this highly radioactive material worldwide

 "can radioactive devices go into the wrong hands? The worst danger is of a" diabolical bomb "also known as radiation dispenser device that can be made from nuclear materials commonly found in hospitals, industries and educational institutions

 It is a matter of concern that there have been many reports about this material going into the wrong hands

 The incident caused much controversy

 Following this incident, the Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) issued new guidelines to strengthen the licensing system and made it mandatory for all institutions using radioactive equipment to dispose of such equipment

 So the villagers decide the distance of 110 km for a grain of 110 rupees
 is par NHRC ne rajya sarkaar ko notice diya he or poocha he ki soobe main aise kitne gaanv hai, jahaan logon ko rashan ke liye saikadon kilometre chalanaa hota he
 The NHRC has sought a response from the government in the matter in four weeks

 Eric Trappier said that all the allegations being made by Congress President Rahul Gandhi are absolutely baseless
 unhone kaha kiraahul gandhi dasolt or reliance ke bich hue joint venture (JV) ke bare main saraasar jhooth bolaa he
 He said that whatever information is given about the deal is absolutely correct, because they do not lie
 Have 7 years to perform our offset
 During the first 3 years, we are not obliged to say with who we are working
 Already settled agreement with 30 companies, which represents 40% of total offset obligation as per contract
 Reliance is 10% out of the 40: Dassault CEO Eric Trappierpic
 twitter
 com / bewbr5gfbs — ANI (@ANI) November 13, 2018 Relations from India since the beginning Eric Trappier said that the relationship between his company and the Congress has been very old, his first deal was in 1953 with Jawaharlal Nehru
 bharat main hamaari deal kisi party se nahin balki desh ke saath he, ham lagaataar bharat sarkaar ko fiter jet muhaiyaa karaate hai
 On the agreement with Reliance in the joint venture of Reliance, not money, Reliance said that the money we have invested is not in Reliance but in the joint venture
 unhone kaha ki is venture main reliance ne bhi paisa lagaaya he, hamaare ejeeniyar industrial part ko lead karenge
 With this, Reliance will also get the experience of making aircraft
 gauratlab he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki dasolt ne reliance ko 284 karod rupee madad ke liye die the
 Whichever part of the offset he made it clear that Dassault and 51% share in Reliance is 49% share in the joint venture
 isamen kul 800 karod rupee kaa invest hoga, jisamen donon companiyaan 50-50 kii hissedaar hongi
 The CEO of Dassault said that we had 7 years to issue the offset, in which in the initial 3 years we are not obliged to name the partner of the offset
 uske baad 40 fisadi hissaa 30 companiyon ko diya gaya, isamen se 10 fisadi reliance ko diya gaya
 After all, what is the cost of Rafale? Breaking the silence on the issue of Rafale price, he said that the aircraft that are currently available are about 9 percent cheaper
 unhone kaha ki jo 36 vimaan kaa rate he, vah maujuuda 18 ke bilkul samaan he
 This price could have been doubled, but this agreement is from government to government, so the price was not increased
 balki daam 9 fisadi sasta bhi hua
 The CEO said that in a ready-to-fly condition, the price of Rafale with 36 contracts is much cheaper than the price of 126 contracts
 HAL se kyon tutaa qaraar?hal ke saath qaraar tuutane par unhone kaha ki jab 126 rafel vimaan ke qaraar kii baat chal rahi thi, tab HAL se qaraar kii hi baat thi
 But if the deal went ahead properly then the agreement would have been given to HAL
 lekin 126 vimaan kaa qaraar sahi nahin hua isliye 36 vimaan ke contract par baat hui
 After which this agreement went ahead with Reliance
 unhone bataaya ki aakhri dinon main HAL ne khud kaha tha ki vah is ofaset main shaamil hone kaa icchhuk nahin hai
 And the path of the agreement with Reliance was completely cleared
 erik bole ki is dauraan vah anya companiyon se qaraar ke bare main bhi soch rahe the, jisamen tata group jaise naam shaamil the
 But we could not take a decision at that time, later it was decided to go with Reliance

 sabhi saansad modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal ke bare main apni baat rakh rahe hai
 Ravi Kishan, Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Gorakhpur, who was present on this forum, said that the reason for Modi ji and Yogi ji was won
 modi ji ne jo 2014 main kaha tho wo sabhi kaam unhone puure kiye
 It was on the public's face that he only needed Modi ji as Prime Minister

 Speaking on all this, Modi emphasized on water conservation to deal with large scale drought in large parts of the country
 2019 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko 303 siton par jeet mili thi
 At the same time, Congress won 52 seats
 pichhali baar ke mukaable is baar bijepi ko 21 siten zyada mili hai
 In 2014, the BJP won 282 seats, while in the 2019 elections, BJP won 303 seats
 vahiin 2014 main congress ke paas 44 saansad the or 2019 main congress ke saansadon kii ginati 52 ho gai
 Apart from this, assembly elections are going to be held in Haryana this year
 punjab main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii sahyogi shiromani akali dal ne haryana main vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Like Punjab, here too, she wants to try her luck with the BJP
 akali dal ne haryana main vidhansabha siton kii demand karke bijepi kii tension badha di he
 In such a situation, the important question is that in the state where BJP is in power with absolute majority, will it leave seats for the Akali Dal

 Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa was also involved in this event through video conferencing

 It has been prepared in collaboration with Russia

 The first unit of this project involving skilled grid started functioning from 31 December 2014
 isaki kshamta 1000 megawatt unit bijli paidaa karne kii he

 ye riector NPCIL or roosi company Atomstroyexport ke sanyukt prayaas se taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai

 bharat sarkaar ne is plant ke liye nirmaan ke liye 1988 main soviet union se qaraar kiya tha
 At that time the Prime Minister of India was Rajiv Gandhi and the head of the Soviet Union was Mikhail Gorbachev
 lekin rus main raajnneetik or aarthik uthapatak ke chalate iskaa nirmaan kaary 1997 main shuru ho sakaa
 8
 pehali do units kaa kaam sitambar 2011 main phir se rokna padaa kyonki plant ke aasapaas ke gaanvvaale iskaa virodh kar rahe the
 However, work on it resumed in March 2012
 or is vakt inase bijli kaa utpaadan ho rahaa he
 9
 13 july 2013 ko pehali barbijli utpaadanhua to isaki kshamta 300 megawatt thi jise charanbaddh tareeke se badhaakar 500 megawatt kiya gaya
 10
 project kii donon ikaayiyon se kul 2,000 megawatt bijli paidaa hogi jisamen tamilnadu ko 925 megawatt, karnataka ko 442, kerala ko 266, puducheri ko 67 megawatt aavantit he
 The remaining 300 MW has not been allocated
 philhal is cote main se 150 megawatt bijli main 100 megawatt tamilnadu ko jabaki 50 megawatt andhra pradesh ko diya ja rahaa he
 Chandauli, adjacent to Banaras, was carved out of Banaras in 1997 by the then Chief Minister Mayawati
 isamen mughalsarai, sakaldiha, saiyadraja or varanasi kii ajgara ke saath shivpur vidhansabha ko shaamil kiya gaya
 22 years after the creation of the district, the Chandauli region is in a state of disrepair
 halaat yah he ki abhi tak iskaa mukhyalay tak puri tarah se nahin ban paaya he
 However, Chandauli is also named in some of the high profile seats of Purvanchal
 saal 2014 main yahaan se bhaajapa ke mahendra nath pandeya ne basapa ke anil maurya ko takreeban dedh lakh vot se patkani di thi
 The majority of the Chandauli district called the rice bowl is rural
 logon kii jeevika khetibari par nirbhar he
 But there was no means of irrigation, hence the farmers were upset and there was a rapid migration
 is ilaake main akele kamalapati treepathi ko chhod den to kisi kii raajnneetik ichhashakti ne yahaan kaam nahin kiya
 Kamalapati Tripathi laid a network of canals here, due to which it is called Purvanchal's rice bowl
 lekin unke baad kisi ne is ilaake kii krishi, shiksha, rojgaar, paryaton, jisamen ye pichhadaa he, ko badhaane kii zaroorat nahin samajhi
 This is the reason that in the initial period, i
e
 after independence, from 1952 to 1971, except for one term in 1967, in which the Socialist Party had won, the Congress continued to win from here four times in a row
 lekin 1971 ke baad ye ilaaka lagaataar apni dasha or disha ko sudhaarney ke liye pratyaashee badalata rahaa lekin isaki badahaali main koi bada sudhaar nahin hua
 Since no party made any major contribution to the development here, caste mathematics always dominated the election here
 chandauli yadav bahulya kshetra he jinaki sankhya takreeban do lakh pachhattar hazaar ke aasapaas he
 Then there is the Dalit fraternity which is around two lakh sixty thousand
 phir pichhadi jati main maurya hai jinaki sankhya ek lakh pachhattar hazaar ke aasapaas he
 Brahmins, Rajputs, Muslims, Rajbhars are also more than a lakh
 azaadi ke baad se ab tak agar is seat par ye dekhte hai ki yahaan koun-koun si party apana paracham laharaa chuki hai to usamen sabase zyaada congress he jo 6 dafe yahaan se jiti he
 But since 1984 the Congress has not tasted victory here, the main reason for this has been the rise of the regional parties and the caste equation
 congress ke baad chaar baar bijepi yahaan se apni jeet kaa paracham laharaa chuki he
 At present, this seat is still with the BJP
 do baar yahaan se sapa or janata party jiti he to ek dafe socialist party or basapa ne jeet hasil kii he
 If you look at the total number of voters at the time of elections in Chandauli Lok Sabha seat in 2014, it was 15 lakh 93 thousand 133
 bijepi ke mahendra nath pandeya ne 4 lakh 14 hajaar 135 vot paakar is chunaav main jeet hasil kii thi
 On the other hand, BSP candidate Anil Kumar Maurya got 2 lakh 57 thousand 379 votes and he finished second in this election
 iske saath hi sapa ke candidet ramkishun ne 2 lakh 4 hajaar 145 vot praapt kiye or congress ke pratyaashee tarun patel ko 27 haajar 194 vot mili
 That is, BJP has the highest percentage of votes of all parties
 23 pratishat vot mila tha uske baad bahujan samaaj party ko 26
 25 and SP to 20
 82 pratishat mat mila tha
 Whereas Congress only own 2
 77 pratishat maton se dastak hi de pai thi
 In the three elections from 1999 to 2009, SP-BSP has been snatching this seat from each other, but in 2014 Modi wave, bjp's alliance with Apna Dal and Rajbhar Party snatched this seat from SP and almost BJP state president Mahendra Pandey emerged victorious here with more than one and a half lakh votes
 is baar phir bijepi ne apane pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya ko hi maidan main utaara he par is baar sameekaran badal gaye hai
 In the alliance of SP and BSP, this seat has gone to the SP, if combined with the percentage of votes of both the last Lok Sabha elections, this percentage is 47 percent, which is more than the bjp's 42 percent
 maton ke in pratishat ke alaava bijepi ke liye om prakaash rajbhar se samjhauta na hona bhi is seat par unhen bada nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 It is clear that in 2019, BJP state president Chandauli seat is seen in the circle of caste equation and there is no clear way to break it at the moment, but what is the possible outcome in politics? It will be a sight to see

 Singh attributed the rising current account deficit (CAD) and global factors to the fall in the rupee
 unhone ummid jataai ki videshi vinimay bazaar main satoria dabaav kam hone ke saath hi rupee main giravat par kaabo paane ke liye haal main uthaae gaye kadamon ko bhartiya rigerv bank waapas le legaa
 The Prime Minister was addressing the annual meeting of the Board of Industries Assocham here today
 arthvyavastha ke bare main unhone kaha ki yadhyapi gharelu arthvyavastha kii neenv majboot tathaa adig he par par chaalu vitt varsh main aarthik vruddhi dar 6
 May be less than the budget estimate of 5 percent
 unhone udyog jagat ko aashwast kiya ki sarkaar arthvyavastha ko pun: teji kii raah par laane ke liye harsambhav kadam uthaaegi
 He said, we will not put any core effort to bring the economy back on the path of boom
 main aap sabhi se aagrah karuunga ki aap nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon main na bahen
 Manmohan said, i would like to say at the outset that we are going through a difficult phase like most other countries
 yah (udyog jagat) arthvyavastha ko oonchi vruddhi dar kii raah par waapas laane ke liye sarkaar kii ore dekh rahaa he
 (his) expectation is justified and it is uppermost in our minds
 pradhanmantri ne udyog jagat ko aashwast kiya ki sarkaar arthvyavastha ko pun: teji kii raah par laane ke liye sakriy bhoomika nibhaayegi
 He said, the government should at least interfere when everything is going well
 jab halaat bighad rahe hon, jaisaa ki ab lag rahaa he, to sarkaar kii jimmedaari banati he ki vah chaukasee ke saath kaam karen
 Singh said that the biggest concern at the moment is the recent volatility in the foreign exchange markets
 isaki bady vajah vaishvik bazaar hai
 These markets are reacting to the possible withdrawal of the US Federal Reserve's current policy of increasing cash flow
 tippaniyan He said, large amounts of money have been withdrawn from emerging markets and the exchange rate of currencies of many emerging market countries has declined
 hamane bhi rupee main tej giravat dekhi he
 In our case this is probably worsened by the fact that our current account deficit (CAD) 4 of GDP in 2012-13
 7 pratishat ho gaya
 Singh said that the government is committed to controlling CAD by addressing the demand and supply side of the problem
 vah visheshkar sone tathaa petroleum utpaadon kii maang par kaabo paaegi
 He said that there has been a huge decline in the import of gold in July and i hope that now its import will remain at normal level
 singh ne rupee main giravat ke liye badhate chaalu khate ke ghate (siedi) tathaa vaishvik karkon ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He hoped that the Reserve Bank of India would withdraw the recent steps to overcome the depreciation of the rupee with the easing of speculative pressure in the foreign exchange market
 pradhanmantri aaj yahaan udyog mandal asocham kii salanaa baithak ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Regarding the economy, he said that although the foundation of the domestic economy is strong and unsustainable, the economic growth rate in the current financial year is 6
 5 pratishat ke bajet anumaan se kam rah sakati he
 He assured the industry that the government will take all possible steps to bring the economy back on track
 unhone kaha, ham arthvyavastha ko pun: teji kii raah par laane ke liye koi kor kasar nahin rakhenge
 i would urge all of you not to run into negative feelings
 manmohan ne kaha, main shuru main hi yah kahana chaahunga ki adhikansh anya deshon kii tarah ham bhi ek kathin daur se guzar rahe hai
 It (industry) is looking towards the government to bring the economy back on the path of high growth rate
 (uski) yah apeksha uchit he or hamaare man main yah sabase upar he
 The Prime Minister assured the industry that the government will play an active role to bring the economy back on the path of acceleration
 unhone kaha, jab sab kuch thik chal rahaa ho to sarkaar ko kam se kam hastkshep karnaa chahie
 When the situation is deteriorating, as it seems now, it becomes the responsibility of the government to work with vigilance
 singh ne kaha ki is samay badi chintaa videshi mudra bazaaron main haal kaa utaar-chadhaav he
 The reason for this is the global market
 ye bazaar america fedral rigerv kii nakadi kaa praavah badhaane kii maujuuda niti ke waapas liye jane kii sambhawana par pratikriya kar rahe hai
 The comments unhone kaha, udiyaman bazaaron se badi maatra main dhan nikaala gaya he or anek udiyaman bazaar deshon kii mudraon kii vinium dar main giravat ai he

 com / kjpjwqfw3u jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 or anuchhed 35 e ko nirast karne ke khilaaf pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra main apni yachika main rahul gandhi kaa zikr karne par buudhvaar ko congress or bhaajapa ne ek duusare par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Pakistan's Human Rights Minister Shirin Mazari has shared an eight-page letter on Twitter, quoting Rahul Gandhi that "people are dying in Jammu and Kashmir"
 ' yuan ko sambodhit patr main likhaa gaya he, 'hinsa kii ghatnaon ko congress party ke netaa rahul gandhi jaise mukhyadharaon ke rajanetaaon ne kabool kiya he
 There is so much wrong going on because of this decision
 'lekin keval rahul gandhi akele bhartiya netaa nahin he, jinka zikr yuan ko sambodhit karte hue likhe khat main kiya gaya he
 The letter also mentions Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Bhajapa MLA Vikram Saini
 patr main kaha gaya he ki 10 agast 2019 ko manohar laal khatter ne kashmiri ladakiyon se shaadi karne ko lekar ek bayaan jari kiya tha
 While addressing a state-level function of Maharishi Bhagirath Jayanti celebrations in Fatehabad, Chief Minister Khattar had reportedly said, 'earlier OP Dhankad used to say that we will bring girls from Bihar to Haryana for marriage
 ab kuch log kah rahe hai ki ham kashmir se ladkiyaan laaenge
 But joke aside
 hamaare samaaj main linganupaat sahi hone ke baad hi ham santulan bana sakate hai
 'BJP MLA Vikram Saini made a similar remark
 unhone kaha tha ki desh main musalamaanon ko anuchhed 370 ke khatm hone se khush hona chahie kyonki ve ab bina kisi dar ke "gori" kashmiri ladakiyon se shaadi kar sakate hai
 Pakistan's letter has mentioned Vikram Saini regarding this statement
 bataa den, jammu-kashmir par rahul gandhi ke taaja bayaan ko lekar congress par tikhaa prahaar karte hue bhaajapa ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki congress netaa evam unki party ko kashmir main hinsa kaa aarope lagane ke sharmasaar karne vaale gaiyr jimmedaarana bayaan ke liye desh se maafee maangani chahie, jiskaa pakistan sanyukt raashtra jaise manch par istemaal kar rahaa he
 The BJP said that Rahul is playing in the hands of Pakistan and is using his statement against India in the neighboring country and he has turned away from his statement not because of circumstances but because of circumstances and under public pressure
 soochna evam prasaaran mantri evam bhaajapa ke varisht netaa prakaash jaavdekar ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘congress ne apni harkaton se desh ko sharmasaar kiya he
 The way Rahul Gandhi made comments about Jammu and Kashmir is scandalous
 ' unhone kaha ki raajnneetik matbhed rahe hai lekin aisa kabhi kisi ne nahin kaha yaa bolaa jiskaa pakistan ne istemaal kiya ho
 'such irresponsible political behavior has not been seen in the last 70 years
 ' jaavdekar ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne ek bayaan diya tha ki jammu-kashmir main kuch sahi nahin ho rahaa he
 He said that reports of violence were coming from there
 ham poochna chaahate hai ki rahul gandhi kahaan se ye jaankariyaan laa rahe hai? unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ne galat bayaan diya he, jammu kashmir main aisa kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 The Union Minister said that Pakistan has made a petition in the UN, making Rahul Gandhi's statement as evidence
 ye diwaliyapan to he hi saath hi congress kii votbank kii raajnneeti bhi he
 The BJP leader said that when the anger of people across the country came to light from this statement, Rahul Gandhi had to take a U-turn from the statement today

 "khadija also took part in the Subroto Cup this year and from the start of the tournament she was waiting for the final match so that Pelé could get a closer look
 kuch aisi hi baat ek or yuva footbal khilaadi rohan bhi kehete hai
 He says that not many visitors had come to the stadium before to see this school level tournament, but if Pelé has seen so many visitors, he will also get an idea of the school level football talent
 footbal kii duniya ke sabase bade naam pele ke karname aaj kii peedi ke liye mithkon jaise hai
 Pictures of his adventures on youtube have surprised everyone
 ipiel yaa spanish lig ke yuva phans ko bhi pele ke karname dang kar dete hai
 With Pelé making headlines in the Indian media for the last few days, the question has also arisen in the minds of the fans that in which direction Indian football is going? It is a matter of relief that after a long time, the experts are raising hope, because now, the grass root level is trying to fix the football itself
 novi kapadia kehete hai ki pehali baar under-17 yaa under-15 ke str par ek hi style se footbal sikhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 For the first time they are playing international club-like football even at the under-15 or under-17 level
 bacchon ko 4-3-3 yaa 4-2-2 se khilne kii training di ja rahi he
 When these children come in the senior team, they will be easy to play at international level
 tippaniyan Indian Football Association , says, "I am trying to change the style of Indian football
 subrato cap ke final match main bhi AIFF kii under-17 team ne acha pradarshan kiya
 "he believes that the Indian team under German coach Nikolai Adam is preparing brilliantly for the Under-17 World Cup to be held in India in 2017
 wo kehete hai ki iskaa asar das saal baad jarur dekhne ko milegaa, jab These players will be seen showing their strength at the international level
 pele ke aane se bhartiya footbal main ratorat badlaav kaa hona katai mumkin nahin, lekin phans shuruyaat ke phaayde kii ummid jarur kar rahe hai
 Football magician Pelé's arrival at Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi is a historic event, but it is very difficult to say how much the Indian football system will be able to benefit from it
 footbal kaa shahenshaah chaahe dilli main hon, lekin bhartiya footbal kii antarrashtriya kamyaabi ke liye dilli behad dur he
 For the time being, one has to be patient for the outcome
 iskaa ek andaja 2017 main bharat main hone vaale world cap ke dauraan jarur ho sakegaa
 Khadija Kazmi, an Air Force School football player who came to the stadium to see Pelé in particular, says, "I have become a fan of Pelé after listening to Papa's mouth
 pele shandaar khilaadi rahe hai
 His technique has been very good
 wo kisi se ladate bhi nahin the
 i am very happy " khadija ne is saal subrato cap main bhi hissaa liya or toornament kii shuruyaat se hi wo final match kaa intazaar kar rahi thim, taaki pele ko kareeb se dekh saken
 Another young football player Rohan also says something similar
 wo kehete hai ki skool str ke is toornament ko dekhne pehle itane darshak stadium nahin aate the, lekin pele kii vajah se agar itane darshak aae hai, to unhen skool str ke footbal tallent kaa bhi andaja ho jayega
 The feats of Pelé, the world's biggest name, are myths for today's generation
 you-tub par unke karnaamon kii tasviren sabko hairaan karti rahi hai
 Young fans of the EPL or Spanish League also stunned Pelé's exploits
 pichley kuch dinon se pele ke bhartiya media main surkhiyaan bane rahane se phans ke jehan main ye sawaal bhi uthta rahaa ki bhartiya footbal kis disha main ja rahaa he? raahat kii baat he ki lambey samay baad jaankaar ummid jagaa rahe hai, kyonki, ab grass root level se hi footbal ko thik karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Novi Kapadia says that for the first time an attempt is being made to teach football in the same style at the under-17 or under-15 level
 pehali baar under-15 yaa under-17 str par bhi antarrashtriya club jaisi footbal khel rahe hai
 Children are being trained to play 4-3-3 or 4-2-2
 ye bachche jab senior team main aaenge, to antarrashtriya str par inhen khilne main aasaani hogi
 The comments bhartiya footbal sangh ke takneekee nideshak scot o donnelle (australia ke) kehete hai, "main koshish kar rahaa hum ki bhartiya footbal kaa style badal sakuun
 The AIFF Under-17 team also performed well in the Subroto Cup final
 " wo maanate hai ki 2017 main bharat main hone vaale under-17 world cap ke liye german coach nikolai adam ke andar bhartiya team shandaar taiyaari kar rahi he
 They say that it will definitely be seen after ten years, when ye khilaadi antarrashtriya str par apana dam dikhaate najar aaenge
 The overnight change in Indian football is not possible with the arrival of Pelé, but the fans are definitely hoping for a start
 footbal ke jaadugar pele kaa dilli ke ambedkar stadium main aana ek aitihaasik ghatana he, lekin bhartiya footbal tantra iskaa kitna phayda uthaa paaegaa, ye kah paanaa behad mushkil he

 39 Indians held hostage in Iraq are still alive
 yah daawa angreji akhbaar 'da sande gargian' ne kiya he
 This information has been given in the report by sources in Pakistan's terrorist organization tehreek-e-taliban (TTP)
 is saal june main iraq ke mosul shahar main aatanki sanghathan 'islamic state of iraq and syria' (iesas) ne bandhak bana liya tha
 The TTP source spoke to the Islamic State commander twice on Saturday, according to the newspaper report
 donon baar iesas kii ore se yahi kaha gaya ki sabhi bhartiya jinda hai or iesas ke kabje main hai
 The newspaper says that it is also trying to contact ISIS in this regard
 gauratlab he ki titipi un aatanki sanghathanon main ek he, jinhone sabase pehle iesas kaa samarthan karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 Sushma Swaraj's statement on abducted Indians Earlier, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had said in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on this issue that the government does not have direct contact with the hostages at present, but six sources claim that they are alive
 haalanki, sarkaar ke paas bandhakon ke jivit yaa mrit hone ke bare main koi thos saboot nahin he
 Sushma had said, "all the news is based on the statement of that Harjeet Christ, whose statements are quite contradictory, while sources in government contacts have claimed till Thursday night that Indian hostages are alive
" 'unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke paas do vikalp hai- pehla yah he ki harjit ke bayaan par bharosa kar un 39 logon kii talash band kar di jaae
 Whereas the second is that we should continue the search by relying on the talk of the six sources who till Thursday night have claimed that 39 Indians held hostage are alive

 The judge said that the court should be careful in interfering with the government's economic policy
 unhone haalanki kaha ki ve yah nahin kahana chaah rahe hai ki sarkaar kii puri aarthik niti nyaayik samiksha se pare he
 Justice Lodha said, 'we have not said that (the government's) overall economic policy is beyond constitutional review, but the court should be extremely retarded and refrained from interfering (in economic policies) and unless it values those Do not violate those which are enshrined in the constitution and do not conflict with the rhythm and soul of the constitution

 Former Telecom Minister Shivraj Patil also lashed out at the committee's report and said that these people cannot see the documents themselves

 He said, 'while the media is covering the news of industrialists and corporates coming to the CBI, the Prime Minister has no name, m Karunanidhi has no name anywhere

 In the meeting of JD (U) workers at the Gandhi Maidan there, he was seen descending from the dais to greet former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 maanjhi ne manch par nitish ko apni kursi saunpte hue baar-baar unase baithne kaa anurodh kiya
 This was the first time Manjhi shared the stage with Nitish in the JD (U) Sampark Yatra campaign, which began on 13 November
 maanjhi ne nitish ko apana 'bada bhai' bataaya, jinhen ve 'kabhi dhokhaa nahin denge
 'this exercise by Manjhi can be understood
 darasal, party ke kai mantri or vidhayak maanjhi ko mukhyamantri pad se hataane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Apparently through his exercise, he was trying to please the JD (U) chief thinker Nitish
 iske ek din pehle hi sampark yatra ke liye nikalne se pehle maanjhi kii bayaanbaji ke mudde par nitish ne kaha tha, ''ham is par 29 taarikh ke baad baat karenge
 The 'sampark Yatra' is scheduled to end on November 29
 jabaki isse pehle tak ve party ke liye jhenp paidaa karne vaale maanjhi ke bayanon par saarvajanik rup se kuch bhi kehane se inkaar karte rahe hai
 Manjhi was present before Nitish within 24 hours of his statement
 unhone nitish ko 'bhagwaan krishna' bataate hue khud ko 'lakshmana' bataaya
 According to party sources, Manjhi started trying to please Nitish when he felt that the demand for his removal was being considered
 isse pehle 24 november ko india today se baatcheet main maanjhi ne puraa aatmavishvaas jaahir karte hue kaha tha ki unhen nitish kaa bharosa hasil he
 "they have full faith in me
" ham donon main isaki aapasi samaj he
 If there is any disturbance from their side, then we will talk or if there is any problem from our side, they will talk
 jab ham unase baat nahin kar rahe hai or ve hamase baat nahin kar rahe hai to samaj jaae ki jo ho rahaa he, vah thik ho rahaa he
 They are doing the work of the party and i of the government
 '' par jahanabad main jis tarah se ve nitish ke aage jhukate dikhe, usase saaf he ki ve sarkaar chalaane main jo aatmavishvaas dikhaa rahe the or party mahasachiv or mukhya pravaktaa ke
 C
 tyaagi ke sujhaavon kii andekhi kar rahe the, usase ab peeche hatane lage hai
 Tyagi suggested them to be prudent while making public statements
 mana ja rahaa tha ki tyaagi ke suzav ko party ke sheersh netritv kii hari jhandi mili hui thi
 Manjhi sidelined his suggestion as he considers only Nitish and Sharad Yadav the biggest leaders of the party
 maanjhi ne kisi kaa naam liye bina is suzav ko yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya tha, ''mere man main jo aayega, main bolne se nahin hichakunga
 i am more intelligent than the people who are suggesting me
 ''asal main maanjhi ko yah takat mahagathbandhan kii anokhi sthiti se mil rahi he
 They know that they cannot be removed from the Chief Minister's chair without the approval of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu lagaataar maanjhi ke sampark main hai
 It is not possible to remove him without Lalu's consent as the support of 24 RJD mlas is very important for the JD (U) government
 jab jedy(you) yaa argedy ke kisi netaa ne vivaadit bayanon par maanjhi kaa bachaav karne kii koshish nahin kii to lalu hi unke bachaav main aage aae the or kaha tha ki maanjhi ne jo kuch kaha he, vah aitihaasik sachaai he
 On November 11, Manjhi described the upper castes as descendants of Aryans from outside and the tribals and Dalits as natives of India
 tyaagi ne maanjhi ko isi bayaan par ehtiyaat baratane kaa suzav diya tha
 Manjhi also knows that he cannot depend on Lalu alone
 jedy(you) ke ek varg ne sheersh netritv ke saamne unki jagah nitish ko laane kaa suzav rakhaa tha
 With this, Nitish can become the Chief Minister again before the next assembly elections to be held in October 2015
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he jab lalu or congress ise manjuuri denge
 a section of JD (U) had also suggested to replace any other leader with Manjhi as Chief Minister under plan-b if consensus was not reached in Nitish's name
 nitish is yojana ke khilaaf nahin hai
 They have said that if they get 'wages' (public support) for their work, then they are ready to become the chief minister again
 haalanki maanjhi kai baar nitish ko jedy(you) kaa supreme netaa sweekaar kar chuke hai, lekin khud ko hataae jane par ve apni aakraamak dalit raajnneeti ke bal par party ko baari nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 The party fears that if Nitish is brought in his place, the BJP may break into the Mahadalit vote bank
 party ko yah dar bhi sata rahaa he ki rajya main vidhansabha chunaav ko saal bhar se kam samay rah gaya he or use jamini str par acha pradarshan karne kii jarurat he, jo philhal hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Manjhi, if removed from the post of CM, can harm the JD (U) with his aggressive Dalit politics, which BJP can take advantage of

 "she does the item number but when the filmmakers tell her about it, they call it a" theme song "
 ''lekin 'item sang' shabd mere liye kisi bhi lihaaj se nakaaratmak nahin he
 However, they do not understand why others believe it to be wrong
 unka maananaa he ki item sang sirf helen yaa silk smita se judaa nahin he
 Such songs and dance are the hallmarks of Bollywood
 sani kahati hai, ''jab main america ke logon ko bataati hum ki main bollywood film shoot kar rahi hum to ve sabase pehle sang, dance or rang-birange set ke bare main baat karte hai na ki film ke plot ke bare main
 According to Sunny, this is also the biggest problem while the reality is that he and other actresses have a lot of offers of item songs

 Karanjit Kaur Vohra alias Sunny Leone, 34, the daughter of a tibetan-punjabi Sikh father and Himachali mother, is a Canadian adult movie actress from Los Angeles

 Sunny has undergone breast enhancement surgery
 ve 2001 main 'paintahouse pet of da manth' or 'hasler hani' rah chuki hai or samalangik sex video main bhi kaam kar chuki hai
 Leonie is married to Daniel Weber, who has been her co-star in porn movies and is also a musician
 unhone ek wibrator ke liye modelling kii he, ituns kaa pehla pornographic ap bhi banaaya or baad main ise hataa liya gaya
 The entire business of Adult Entertainment is done through their company Leoni LLC

 From her first film Jism 2 (2012) to the superhit Ragini MMS 2 (2014) and now in legal trouble Mastizaade, she has been in the spotlight for adult filmmaking for the past five years
 unki production company san last pikchars kaa lakshya saaf taur se edlt antertenment he
 And Leonie's adult entertainment business has not declined
 sani leyoni ke saath kaam kar chuke ek film produsar unke bare main kehete hai, ''vah pav bhaaji yaa fast food kii tarah he jo zyada din tak nahin chal paata
 Since coming to Bigg Boss 5 in 2011, Sunny has not become friends in the film industry in the last four years and she herself accepts this truth
 filmi duniya main ve aaj bhi bahari hai, bade bannron ke liye ve asprishy hai or unki dibbaband film itani bakawaas he—jinhone ise dekha he, unka maananaa he ki is film main jarurat se zyada foohadataa he—ki film pramann apili nyaayaadhikaran (epasieti) ne is film ko hi bain kar diya he

 Shahid Kapoor's brother Ishaan may have used the term baby doll for his sister-in-law, which is also socially acceptable but the existence of the real baby doll is in danger

 In such a situation, they might have to return to where they came from
 leyoni ne ek baar apane ek ko-star se kaha tha ki agar katrina caff bollywood main aa sakati he to ve bhi yahaan apni kismat aajamaa sakati hai
 To this, his co-star replied, "everyone has the right to dream
 '' aaj ve unki aakankshaon ko mahaj 'bhram bataate hai
 In the last four years, writers who have portrayed Sunny in roles ranging from an attractive face to a sensible woman believe that neither vulgarity nor feminist theories can help Leon make Indian Angelina Jolie
 lekin sani ke paas iskaa jawaab he, ''bollywood kii har safal heroin kii pehali das filmein buree tarah pity thim
 She grew up watching American cinema anyway, where pornography is not considered so bad
 iske alaava unki soch bhi bhartiya nahin he
 She has been continuously isolating herself from her past
 leyoni apni keemat unhen milane vaale clicks se aankati hai
 The number of people who hate them is not less than those who like them and they give credit to the analysts

 Mahesh Bhatt once called it his 'cynicism' about Leoni's strategy of not coming forward in mainstream cinema fast
 lekin ab ve yahaan pichhadati ja rahi hai
 However, Leoni was better than Katrina Kaif, who knocked Bollywood through Boom, because her fans were already there
 ve hansate hue bataati hai, ''jab maine 2008 main shuruyaat kii thi to log mere paas aakar kehete the, 'ham aapke fain hai' or main jawaab detii thi, ''lekin ab to main yahaan aa chuki hum! '' ve aaj bhi apane maujuuda prashansakon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hi script chunati hai, iske alaava nae prashansak jodgaye kii ore bhi dhyaan diya jaataa he

 Lettie explains, box office cannot turn into such a huge success, forcing Yash Raj Films to give him a chance to work with any big star
 or jaisaa industry ke diggajon kaa kahana he, aisa kabhi hoga bhi nahin
 Leonie is in no hurry
 ve kahati hai, ''main apni jagah khud bana rahi hum
 He believes that One Night Stand, which is Rati Agnihotri's son Tanuj Virwani's first film and Jasmin d'souza's debut as director, is different from the rest of his sex comedy films
 beyimaan lav rajeev choudhary kii film he or isamen leyoni aaj kii aurat kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai
 She believes that these films will take her to serious cinema
 lekin film udyog donon hi filmon ko 'bi-grad' qaraar detaa he
 According to Ragini MMS 2 producer Tanuj Garg, Leoni is well aware that it takes time for any actor to be taken seriously
 leyoni ab pornography se swechha se alag hona chaahati hai
 She says, "I am left with no other option as things are being heard and the work is being done
" kuch log aise hote hai jo aapkaa vajood khatm karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 "she and her husband are making every effort to adapt themselves to Indian culture and that is why they have decided not to promote any kind of pornographic material in India
" yahaan khud ko sabit karne kii aisi jid kyon jabaki itani mehnat to ve los angelis kii duniya main bhi kar sakati hai jo itani kattar nahin he? leyoni kahati hai, ''jitani pahchaan yahaan mil sakati he, utani vahaan milanaa sambhav hi nahin he
 '' And in America? There are many like her: "dozens who are very beautiful, beautiful body dress, good actress and who have got the right training
" '' or yahaan bharat main, ''ve un chuninda actors main se ek ban sakati hai jinhen log pasand karte hai
 "and here they also have" x factor "and what is that x factor? She says, "my past yesterday
" '' yani jo tabah kar rahaa he, vahi bana bhi rahaa he
 Whatever allegations the Bollywood heads make, but here the truth prevails
 shikshakon kii kami se jujh rahe madhya pradesh ke sarkari skool ke shikshak in dinon vidhayak ji ke nijee staff ke taur par kaam kar rahe hai
 You may be surprised to hear but it is true
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main khud saamaanya prashasan vibhaag mantri doctor govind singh ne bataaya he ki sarkari skool ke shikshakon ko vidhayak ke personal staff ke taur par atech kiya gaya he
 Teachers of government schools of Madhya Pradesh, who are struggling with shortage of teachers, are leaving school these days and working as personal staff of honorable people
 iskaa khulaasa bhi khud sarkaar ne hi kiya he
 In fact, during the recent assembly session, the Minister of General Administration Department, Dr
 Govind Singh released the list of government teachers who have been attached as personal staff of mlas
 inamen se zyaadaatar sarkari shikshakon ko congress vidhayakon ke saath atech kiya gaya he
 In Madhya Pradesh, many questions are being raised about attaching government teachers with legislators
 ajtak ne rajgad or harda jile ke sarkari skulon main shikshakon kii kami par padtaal kii to paaya ki rajgad ke simali kalam ke sarkari skool main kareeb 157 bachche padhate hai lekin skool main ek bhi sarkari shikshak nahin he
 The entire school is running on the trust of guest teachers
 shikshakon kii kamirajgad ke simali kalam ke sarkari skool main padhaane vaale shikshak kii maane to iskaa asar skool ke rigelt par bhi pad rahaa he
 At the same time, the condition of the secondary school in Seagon of Harda is no different
 yahaan bhi shikshakon kii kami he or ise dur karne ke liye vibhaag ne jis shikshak ko padasth kiya he use jaankaree naa hote hue bhi ganit, angreji or science padhaanaa pad rahaa he
 In fact, about 4,500 schools in Madhya Pradesh are running without any regular teachers
 rajgad jile main 2,844 niyamit shikshakon kii kami he
 There is a shortage of 1600 regular teachers in Harda, while 54 schools are running without teachers
 darasal shiksha ke adhikaar ke tahat har 30 bacchon par ek shikshak kaa hona jaruri he lekin madhyapradesh main kai skool aise hai jahaan shikshak hi nahin hai or padhai kaa kaam atithi shikshakon ke bharose chal rahaa he
 Congress MLA from Nagda Dilip Singh Gurjar is also one of the mlas whose government teacher Swaroop Narayan Chaturvedi has been appointed in the staff
 ajtak se baat karte hue vidhayak ji khud bol rahe hai ki ye niyukti unhone apni pasand se karwaai he
 The MLA says that the teachers know our region and our people very well, so have taken them together
 shivaraj sarkaar main bhi hui thi niyuktiapako bataa den ki 2009 main tatkaaleen shivaraj sarkaar ne aadesh nikaal kar shiksha ke adhikaar ke tahat sarkari shikshakon ke gaiyr-shaikshanik kaaryon ke liye niyukt karne par roak laga di thi
 But even during that time, teachers continued to be appointed as personal staff of mlas
 haalanki shikshakon ko vidhayakon ke personal staff ke rup main niyukti ko khud saamaanya prashasan vibhaag mantri doctor govind singh galat nahin maanate hai
 Talking to Aaj Tak, he said that even though the policy was made in the Shivraj government, then the government did not implement it
 isliye puraani parampara ko kamalnath sarkaar ne bhi jaise kaa taisa rakhaa
 At the same time, the minister has also given a big reason for not getting the recruitment of clerks
 bijepi ne khadey kiye sawaalvahin shaskeey shikshakon ko vidhayakon ke saath atech karne par bijepi ne kamalnath sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Vishwas Sarang, a minister in the Shivraj government, has asked the government to order the teachers to teach back in school, with the demand to withdraw the order
 skool chalem ham or padhegaa india tabhi to badhegaa india jaise naaron ke jariye sarkarein bacchon ko skool tak laane kaa dam to bharti najar aati hai lekin wo ye bhul rahi hai ki skulon main jab shikshak hi nahin rahenge to bachche naa to pard paaenge naa india bad paayegaa

 The CBI, which has been camping in Sirsa for the past one week, has received some substantial evidence against Babagurmeet Ram Rahim, the head of Dera Sacha Sauda
 'mail today' ke sutron ke anusaar, pichhali baar jab sibiai sirsa gai thi to use khaali haath lautnaa padaa tha
 But this time, the CBI has handed over important evidence to make the Dera devotees collectively impotent
 pichhali baar deraa ke dabaav main peediton ne sibiai kii jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya tha
 Hans Raj Chauhan, a former supporter of Auradera Sacha Sauda, a key witness in the case, has also been produced in the Punjab and Haryana High Court
 unhone 'mail today' se baat karte hue kaha ki deraa ke zyaadaatar peediton ko jaan kii dhamkee di gai he, isliye ve gurmeet ram rahim ke khilaaf apana munh nahin khol rahe hai
 Some people also have social fear that it might spoil their honor in the society
 sutron ke anusaar hans raaj chouhan ne sibiai ke saamne ek baar phir apana bayaan darj karaayaa he, lekin unhone is bare main baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 CBI detectives have met some former Dera devotees
 is dauraan unhone kuch aise logon ko bhi dhundh nikaala jinako deraa main bhagwaan ke naam par napunsak banaaya gaya tha
 Some of these people have even agreed to record their statements before the Judicial Magistrate
 sibiai in logon ko lekar dilli aa rahi he, kyonki is maamle main cese dilli main hi darj hua he
 According to sources, the CBI is planning to videography their statements so that they do not retract when they go to court

 "my name is Monica Lewinsky
 haalanki mujhe kai baar kaha gaya ki main apana naam badal luun
 Many times i am asked why i have not changed yet, but i have not changed
 main hi wo pehali insaan hum, jisane apni izzat online shering ke zariye khoyi, jabaki us vaqt fasebuk, twitor nahin the, lekin i-mail or news website tab bhi thim
 Whenever i watched TV, whenever i went online, i was inundated with people who were treated with dirty abuses
 bhadde gaanon main meraa naam aata tha
 Only one thing resonated in the ears - i want to die
 " When Monica Lewinsky met the media 16 years later during a Forbes event, she could not stop her tears while reciting the tragedy
 ji haa, ye vahi monica levinsky he jo 1998 main america ke raashtrapati bill clinton se apane prem sambandhon ke kaaran surkiyon main aa gai thim
 Monica was just 22 years old when she started working as an intern at the White House
 mujhe hameshaa ye baat sataati rahi he ki jab is puure prakaran main do log baraabar shariq the, apni marzi se, phir sazaa akeli monica hi kyon bhugatti rahi
 a man betrayed his marriage, but his wife Hillary Clinton supported him
 us aadmi ke haath se satta nahin gai
 With the support of his wife, he came out of both political and domestic crisis
 taaqat yahi hoti he
 But a young girl became a criminal in America at such a young age
 ye ek bahut bada udhaaharan he ki log ladakiyon ke prati kitne jajmental hote hai
 Not only in India, but also in other countries
 hamaare desh main anoushka sharma panauti he
 No player's brother, son, father
 jaise aalia bhatta sabase murkh hai
 No Varun Dhawan or any other hero
 itane dinon se deepika padukon kii vogue video soshal media par viral ho rahi he
 Women are also not behind in criticizing it
 haalanki bahut hi karaab script or kamazor screenple kii vajah se ye behad karaab video thi, lekin jahaan tak mujhe lagata he, iskaa sandesh itnaa hi tha ki mahilaon ke prati jajmental kam hua jaae
 i wish it were written a little better
 main ye samajhane main naakaam hu ki "maay chois" se mahila shashaktikaran kis tarah judaa he
 Whether you want to get married or not, it can be your wish
 lekin aap shaadi nibhaaen yaa naa nibhaaen, ye faisla aap is shaadi se jude baaki logon par kaise thope sakati hai
 Of course, your wearing, wearing, walking, working is your desire
 lekin isi tark se phir aap burka pahanane vaali, sindur lagane vaali, ghar main khapane vaali mahila ko ablaa qaraar nahin de sakate, kyonki phir wo bhi kahegi - "maay chois"
 You are weakening the women's fight with this cheap script
 mahila shashaktikaran kaa matlab mere liye sirf ek hi he - aatm sammaan
 If you can fight your husband, your parents and your weaknesses for your self-respect, then you are absolutely a strong woman
 lekin aap apane aatm-sammaan ko taak par rakhkar apni bhavukta kii vajah se kisi se maar khaati hai, dhokhaa bardaasht karti hai, kisi duusari ladki ke sammaan ko thes pahunchaati hai, to phir manmarzi kapade pahanane or khub paisa kamaane ke baavjood deepika padukon yaa hillari clinton bhi saamaanya mahilaayein hi hai
 If you talk twice in the name of "my Choice", then you are taking a very easy path and will forgive that there are better women than you in this country
 aap kisi vigyaapan ke zariye is tarah kaa sandesh dene ke qaabil nahin hai
 If you are truly a strong woman, then show yourself working in the film industry on your own terms
 bazaar kaa utpaada banane se inkaar kijiye
 Raise your voice on every wrong thing
 bich kaa rasta kahin nahin le jaataa
 Due to this weak video, some men got a chance and through their videos, they started to teach women equal lessons
 sabak aap tab sikhaaiye, jab aap samaj len ki aakhir ye barabari hoti kya he
 Just read a friend's post today
 agar ek ladke ko koi ladki ghurti he, to zaruri nahin ki use isse koi aitaraaz ho, lekin ek ladke kaa ghoorna, kisi ladki ko asahaj kar saktaa he
 How should society blame girls for rape and not boys, keep this in mind
 jis din aap ye sweekaar karne lagen ki aap jis kaam ko apni mouj-masti kaa naam dete hai or mahilaayein bhi use shame kii bajaay mouj-masti kaa naam de sakati hai, to aap zarur barabari ke jhande uthaaiye
 The entire issue of women empowerment is currently focused on the equality of men

 Then who is this fight with? mujhe nahin lagata ki feminism kisi kitaab main padhakar siikhaa ja saktaa he
 Every woman should read her life first and then she will not have to learn Feminism from anyone
 kyonki aapaki yatra saamaanya nahin thi
 The girl who, instead of giving up her life, had to endure that disgrace for many years and did not change her name, might have taught Feminism to America's most powerful woman

 ) Then there was no metro speed in Delhi, no flood of floods
 naa chamchamata airport naa damakata railway stesan
 Old Delhi was also very old then and was raised from the same old Delhi
 ye kahani he puraani dilli ke teliwada ilaake main rahane vaale 18 saal ke aamir kii
 When he became independent after 14 years, not only the appearance of Delhi has changed the whole of Delhi
 lekin wo khud is badlaav kaa gavaah nahin ban paaya
 Because the most beautiful 14 years of his life were snatched away from him and given to bars
 wo salakhen ab tut chuki hai, uski baaki kii umr bhi use lautaai ja chuki hai
 But the question is whether in his past 14 years, 5110 days, will anyone be able to return? The point is 1996-97
 in do saalon main dilli, upi or haryana main alag-alag taarikh or vakt par kul 22 dhamaake hue the
 The blasts took place on the road, in the market, in restaurants, in buses, even in trains
 in dhamaakon ke liye bangladesh or pakistan main chupe aatankwaadi or bam export abdul kareem tunda va kuch duusare aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya
 The investigation of the blasts was carried out by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, but two years passed and his hands were empty
 uske baad 20 farvari 1998 kii wo raat ai, jisane aamir kii jindagi badal di
 18-year-old Aamir, who lives in Teliwara area of old Delhi, had come out of the house to take medicine
 puraani dilli se aam taur par is tarah kisi ko yun uthaa le janaa mushkil hota he
 Because people are awake till late at night, shops are open
 par yahaan sab kuch itani jaldi hua ki koi kuch samaj paata tab tak gypsy nikal chuki thi
 Till now Aamir had the illusion that maybe someone has kidnapped him
 magar ek baar jaise hi wo gaadi se baahar niklaa use sab samaj aa chukaa tha
 Aamir was illegally kept in police custody for seven days
 is dauraan us par tamaam julm dhahaae gaye
 He was forcibly signed on plain papers
 is dauraan aamir ke gharavaale lagaataar apane bete ko talash rahe the
 They did not know which people and where their son was taken away
 He received this news on 28 February
 jab akhabaaron kii hedlins main unke bete kaa naam aayaa
 Apart from Aamir, another boy was picked up by the police, his name was Mohammad Shakeel
 use aamir kaa saathi bataaya gaya
 Apparently the news of Aamir's family as well as the entire Old Delhi was startled by this news
 jitani aamir kii umr nahin thi usase zyada dhamaakon kaa iljaam ab uske naam tha
 More than age cases were on his head
 pal bhar main aamir kii jindagi hi badal chuki thi
 He was in the 11th grade when he was raised
 par ek jatke main ab wo student se ek khoonkhaar aatankwaadi banaaya ja chukaa tha
 but why? After all, why Aamir? Why was he raised? Why was he accused of 22 blasts? Could the police have picked anyone else in such a full city? So why Aamir? Did he have an old criminal record? Or any connection to Pakistan or Bangladesh? Aaj Tak found out that it was found out that Aamir's sister is married in Pakistan
 bas yahi uskaa pakistan se rishta tha
 But not just from Pakistan, but from terrorist organizations sitting in Pakistan
 aaj tak ne aamir kii pichhali jindagi ke bare main chaanbin kii
 We came to know that he had no criminal background
 phir aamir ko hi police ne kyon pakadaa? ye sawaal hamane aamir se hi puch liya
 The charge was so big and frightening that Aamir's entire family broke up
 padosi chhodie apano tak ne aamir ke gharavaalon se kinaaraa kar liya
 Aamir's father had a small business
 wo bacchon ke liye khilone banaate the, usee se ghar kaa guzar-basar hota tha
 The son was charged with the biggest charges
 police aamir ko aatankwaadi qaraar dekar apana kaam kar chuki thi
 Now Aamir had to prove that he is not a terrorist but a student and innocence is not proved for free
 iske liye court-kachhari vakil kaa kharchaa aata he
 The father gave everything for the son's case
 khilaunon ke jariye dusron ke bacchon ke chehre par muskaan bikherne vaale kaa khud apana sabase pyaara khilonaa tut rahaa tha
 There was also time left to make toys after the court-office round
 lihaaja ghar kii mali haalat khasta hoti gai
 The son's sorrow broke the father so much that Aamir's father died just three years after Aamir's arrest
 badanasibi dekhie ki aamir apane baap ko mitti bhi nahin de sakaa, kyonki wo jail main tha
 But yes, when his father came to visit him in Tihar before he died, he still remembers what he told him
 aamir ke pita kii maut ke baad ab aamir ke cese kii sari jimmedaari uski maa ne uthaa lee, kyonki ghar main or koi tha nahin
 There was a sister who had gone to Pakistan after getting married
 par aamir kii badanasibi yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The death of Shauhar and the stigma of terrorist on the forehead of the son, both of these sorrows severely broke Aamir's mother too
 sadma aisa laga ki thik usee saal jis saal shuhar kii maut hui thi, aamir kii maa ko bhi lakva maar gaya
 Most of the body stopped working
 ab ghar main ek jinda laash thi or ghar ke baahar kanoonee khel
 There was no one to lobby, but time passed slowly
 ab tak aamir par ek saath teen rajyon main hue dhamaakon ke silsile main mukadmaa chalanaa shuru ho chukaa tha
 These cases were going on in the sessions courts of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Rohtak and Sonepat
 dhamaakon ke silsile main aamir ke khilaaf 22 mukademe darj hue the
 These included sedition and war against the country along with all other streams
 mukademon kii sunwaayee apni raftaar se chal rahi thi
 Years and months were passing by
 is bich jail main aamir ne padhai shuru kar di, lekin aarope hi aisa laga tha ki jail main bhi use sukun se nahin rahane diya gaya
 Taunts were killed that even terrorists would study now
 udhar chaar shaharon yani dilli, gajiabad, rohtak or sonipat main tamaam gavaahon or sabooton ke bich mukademe kii karrwai jari thi
 The cities were different, of course, but it was not a joint operation of Delhi, UP or Haryana Police
 aamir kii giraftaar se lekar tamaam aarope dilli police kii special cell ne lagaae the
 In connection with these four cities and 22 blasts, the police had created a broad army of about 400 witnesses
 phir wo vakt bhi aayaa jab ek-ek kar adaalaton ne apana faisla sunaanaa shuru kiya
 Not a single witness in the Sonepat, Rohtak and Ghaziabad sessions courts upheld the police story
 lihaaja in teenon hi adaalaton se aamir bari ho gaya
 The blot of Delhi blasts was still on his forehead
 dilli police kii special cell ne aamir kii giraftaar sadar bazaar railway stesan signal number das se dikhaai thi
 But there was no evidence of this arrest
 jabaki kanuunan police ko is giraftaar ke bare main jiarapy yaa arpeef yani railway police force ko jaankaree deni chahie thi or unhen is giraftaar kaa gavaah bhi bananaa chahie tha
 Apart from this, there were no such witnesses who could have seen Aamir placing bombs in the place where there were blasts in Delhi
 jin gavaahon ko police ne dhamaakon kaa chashmadid bataaya tha, wo bhi adaalat main mukar gaye
 Apart from the witnesses, the police could not produce any such evidence, from which Aamir's relationship with the blasts could be established
 yahaan tak ki abdul kareem tunda yaa kisi aatankwaadi sanghathan ke saath uske rishte bhi police sabit nahin kar pai
 So, one by one, Aamir was acquitted of the charges of the blasts and then finally got his release from jail on January 9, 2012 after 14 long years
 chunki aamir kii giraftaar or aamir ke khilaaf cese dilli police kii special cell ne taiyaar kiya tha, lihaaja aaj tak ne is bare main dilli police ke aalaa afasaron se baat karne kii tamaam koshishen kin
 But the Delhi Police refused to talk about Aamir
 aamir beshak ab aaazaad he, wo ghar laut aayaa he
