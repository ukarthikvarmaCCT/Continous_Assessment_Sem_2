 After widespread protests and signature campaign against the shutdown of the Hindi service, the BBC said on Monday that it would maintain the bbc's one-hour evening service for the next one year and explore options for its funding

 The service was to stop on 31 March but has been extended for a year
 bibisi world sarvice ne kaha he ki use kai vyavsaayik pakshon ne seva ke liye vaikalpik vitt poshan kaa suzav diya tha
 But if no option is found then this service will be stopped in March 2012
 is abhiyaan ko arundati raay, vikram seth or mark tuli ne samarthan diya tha
 These people had said that the BBC Hindi service has one crore listeners, mostly from rural areas

 With the help of Rohit Sharma (140), his 24th century, Lokesh Rahul (57) and the brilliant half-centuries of captain Virat Kohli (77), the Indian cricket team has challenged 337 runs to win against Pakistan in the World Cup

 Except for the institutions of counting, what is the matter in the university of India, we keep showing you from time to time in the university series
 nai ghatana ye he ki manipur uniwarsity main chaatro ne vaais chancelar adya prasad pandey ke khilaaf andolan ched diya he
 There has been a halt of studies there for 40 days and in support of students, the chairman of about 28 departments has resigned from his post
 alag alag academik skulon ke 5 dean ne bhi istapha de diya he
 The reasons for this strike are the same which are present in many universities in India
 30 may se ye chaatr jin maangon ko lekar hadtaal par hai wo har uniwarsity main hai
 These students had also given charter of their demand earlier
 jab sunwaayee nahin hui tab dharne par baith gaye
 The emphasis of the students is on better academic calendar and to fill up vacant posts of teachers so that students can get teachers
 chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh em dayaaman ne bataaya ki uniwarsity main 115 pad khaali hai
 It has 25 professors, 51 associate professors and 39 assistant professors
 itane pad khaali hai to samajhie padhai kya khaak hoti hogi

 This causes the files to be stuck for a long time

 The academic calendar could have been better under peace conditions

 It takes 30 to 45 days to get the original certificate, whereas earlier it used to take only 2 to 5 days
 chaatr sangh kii hadtaal main staff association bhi saath aa gaya or ab to shikshak sangh bhi saath aa gaya he
 Now the matter has reached the place that the Students and Teachers Association says that until the Vice Chancellor Adya Prasad Pandey is removed, there will be no solution to this strike

 Do you know that 80 percent of the country's education takes place in colleges and their condition is very bad
 90 pratishat ucch shiksha rajya uniwarsity main hoti he jinaki haalat or bhi karaab he
 What attention is being paid to these, nothing is known
 is baat kaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki 9 july yani aaj ke din maanav sansaadhan mantri ne istitute of eminance kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Prakash Javadekar has tweeted that this is the Landmark Initiative i
e
 a step to prove to be a milestone
 unhone twit isliye kiya he kyonki sarkaar ke export ke panel ne institute of Eminence kaa chayan kar liya he
 Today we are releasing the list of 6 universities
 3 sarkari hai or 3 privet hai
 instituteofeminence are quite important for the country
 hamaare paas 800 uniwarsity hai lekin ek bhi uniwarsity duniya kii top 100 yaa 200 main nahin he
 Today's decision will help us achieve this
 manipur uniwarsity main 115 teacher nahin hai, uske jaise na jane kitne college or uniwarsity main teacher nahin hai magar bharat ko lagata he ki pehla kaam top 100 yaa 200 main aa janaa he
 It is good, it should be stubborn, but it should also be tuned that there are universities and colleges for 95 per cent students, at least they should be able to read and teach
 ranking par bahut adhik bharosa karnaa thik nahin hota he
 Somewhere its condition does not become like TRP
 prakaash jaavdekar ne 20 march 2017 ko loksabhaa main prashn kaal ke dauraan bayaan diya tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity main 9000 shikshak niyukt kar denge
 a year passed
 yaheen dilli main ye haal he
 Appointing teachers in the classroom should also be a landmark decision, but the stubbornness of the rankings is probably big news
 jin chah uniwarsity kaa chayan hua he unamem naam hai iaiti dilli, iaiti bombai, indian istitute of science bangaloru bhi shaamil hai
 The names of these three institutions have been in the world ranking even earlier
 times hair ajukeshan ranking main indian istitute of science kaa sthaan 251 se 300 ke bich he
 IIT Delhi and Bombay are ranked between 500 and 600
 in teenon ke alaava jo teen privet uniwarsity hai unamem se ek ke bare main abhi kuch khaas pataa nahin he
 Jio Institute by Reliance Foundation, Birla Institute of Technology and science-pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education
 reliance kaa jeeyo mobile or wifai ne telecom kii duniya main kaaphi uthal puthal machaa di he
 But what will the Jio Institute feed, what will be its budget and how will it reach the private universities of the world, let's see now, but the name of Jio Institute is interesting in this list
 hamane association of indian uniwarsity ke mahasachiv furqaan qamar se baat kii
 Furkan Sahab has a point
 jin das sansthaanon ko institute of eminance main shaamil kiya janaa he usamen ucch shiksha main desh bhar ke chaatro kaa sava pratishat chaatr hi honge jo ki bahut kam hai
 What's happening to 99 percent of the students
 aap apane-apane rajyon ke collejon main jaakar haalat dekh sakate hai
 50 percent are not faculty, that is, not teachers
 shaayad ab yah samasya belgaum ho chuki he, inhen thik karne kii raftaar itani dhimi hogi ki usase prachaar nahin hoga magar isaki jagah das bees sansthaanon par bada paisa kharch kiya jaae or ve ranking hasil kar len to use lekar hedline bhi tagdi banegi or cover story bhi chamakdaar lagegi
 GD College has 24,000 students and 28 teachers
 kai vibhaag khaali hai to koi college aae hi kyon
 This is a clipping of Dainik Bhaskar of Bihar
 ek shikshak par 1059 chaatr kaa ausat he
 In any sense, this average is terrible
 koi bhi akelaa shikshak ek hazaar chaatro ko padhaa hi nahin saktaa he
 Gives teeth yah college bihar ke begusarai zile main he
 In our university series, we told about the condition of another college of Shri Krishna Mahila College in this district
 vahaan saadhe das hazaar chatraayen hai or maatr 9 shikshak hai
 1200 girls on one teacher
 main kahana yah chahta hum ki zarurat bharat ke in chaatro ko shikshak kii he taaki ve bhi acchhee padhai hasil kar saken magar unhen das uniwarsity kii ranking kaa sapana dikhaa kar mile kaa pathar bataaya ja rahaa he

 On the occasion of 100 years of Patna University, Prime Minister Modi had said that 10 private and 10 government universities should bring their plan, tell how they will develop themselves, the government will give them 10,000 crore in the next five years
 hamane record check kiya
 In the 2016-17 budget, a blueprint will be prepared to make 20 Indian universities among the top 200 in the world
 magar mantri ji ne plan jari karte hue kaha he ki ummid he ki agle das saal main ye santhaan top 500 main aa jaaenge or uske baad top 100 main
 Three are still in the top 500
 kahaan to bajet main top 200 kii baat he magar elaan karte hue top 500 ho gaya
 Did the government itself reduce the target? yahi nahin, 2016 ke bajet main isaki baat thi magar 2018 aadha biit gaya tab tak sarkaar sirf 6 uniwarsity kii hi list jari kar saki he
 Less than half has been announced in two and a half years
 ab rahi bajet kii baat to 2016-17 ke bajet main sirf baat thi, bajet nahin tha
 Provision of only 50 crores in the budget of 2017-18
 us paise kaa kya hua hoga, sarkaar hi bataa sakati he kyonki 2017-18 ke bich to institute of eminance kii suchi hi nahin ai
 The 2018-19 budget has a fund of 250 crore in the name of a world-class institution
 agar bajet dekhen to abhi tak sarkaar ne iske liye 300 karod kaa hi praavdhaan kiya he jabaki vah paanch saal main 10,000 karod dene kii baat karti he
 In the budget of 2016-17, there is a matter of giving 500 crore every year to each of the 20 institutions, this amount is increased to 1000 crore in the next budget
 kya ham har saal 20 santhaan ko 1000 karod dekar paanch saal main 10,000 karod kharch kar top 200 kii ranking hasil kar sakate hai, vaise maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha he ki in sansthaanon ko agle paanch saal main ek hazaar karod tak diya jayega
 That is 200 crore to an institution every year
 200 karod main kya hoga
 If you are finding this amount too much, you are seeing milestones, then look at the budget of the University of America
 ise ham indowment fund bolte hai matlab itane paise kaa fund hai inke paas
 - Harvard University's endowment fund is $ 36 billion, ie 2,47,140 crores in Indian rupees - yel uniwarsity kaa indowment fund he 27
 17 billion dollars i
e
 1,82,128 crores in Indian rupees - stempord uniwarsity kaa indowment fund he 24
 78 billion dollars i
e
 1,70,114 crores in Indian rupees harvard kaa indowment fund kareeb dhai lakh karod kaa he
 In the fiscal year ended 30 June 2017, Harvard University spent 33,638 crore
 harvard uniwarsity main 22,000 chaatr padhate hai
 Do you know how much is the budget of Bihar's estimated annual expenditure i
e
 9 crores
 bihar kaa is saal kaa bajet he 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod
 In 2016-17, Bihar spent 20,394 crores on higher education, sports, arts and culture
 isamen se 22 pratishat hissaa selary par karch hua
 In 2017-18, the share of salary in the budget of 26,394 crores decreased to 19
 5 ho gaya
 That is, a three percent drop in salary in a year
 matlab yah hua ki nae shikshak kam behaal hue
 Can any university in India match Harvard, Yale or Stanford? Why can't she do it but can't do 10,000 crores or this kind of attitude
 2016 main hi kaha gaya tha ki 20 sansthaanon kaa chunaav hoga lekin 2018 kaa aadha biit jane par 6 sansthaanon kaa elaan ho rahaa he, usamen se ek jeeyo institute abhi kaayam nahin hui he
 Don't be disappointed, Harvard University was established in 1636, Yale University was formed in 1701 and Stanford in 1891
 harvard or yel ke pehle kaa to aapako kya milegaa, main dukhi nahin karnaa chahta
 Prior to Stanfort, Aligarh Muslim University, Allahabad University, Kolkata University and Madras University were established in India
 ye sab jaanane ke liye he
 Both knowing and promoting are separate actions

 medical college ke chaatr jabalpur court chale gaye
 Smriti was leading this movement
 adaalat ne chaatro ke haq main faisla diya magar college ne or fees maang di
 Fed up with the situation after that, Smriti Laharpur committed suicide

 Students are selected through competition

 It is good, it should be stubborn, but it should also be tuned that there are universities and colleges for 95 per cent students, at least they should be able to read and teach
 ranking par bahut adhik bharosa karnaa thik nahin hota he
 Somewhere its condition does not become like TRP

 On the occasion of 100 years of Patna University, Prime Minister Modi had said that 10 private and 10 government universities should bring their plan, tell how they will develop themselves, the government will give them 10,000 crore in the next five years
 hamane record check kiya
 In the 2016-17 budget, a blueprint will be prepared to make 20 Indian universities among the top 200 in the world
 magar mantri ji ne plan jari karte hue kaha he ki ummid he ki agle das saal main ye santhaan top 500 main aa jaaenge or uske baad top 100 main
 Three are still in the top 500
 kahaan to bajet main top 200 kii baat he magar elaan karte hue top 500 ho gaya
 Did the government itself reduce the target? yahi nahin, 2016 ke bajet main isaki baat thi magar 2018 aadha biit gaya tab tak sarkaar sirf 6 uniwarsity kii hi list jari kar saki he
 Less than half has been announced in two and a half years
 ab rahi bajet kii baat to 2016-17 ke bajet main sirf baat thi, bajet nahin tha
 Provision of only 50 crores in the budget of 2017-18
 us paise kaa kya hua hoga, sarkaar hi bataa sakati he kyonki 2017-18 ke bich to institute of eminance kii suchi hi nahin ai
 The 2018-19 budget has a fund of 250 crore in the name of a world-class institution
 agar bajet dekhen to abhi tak sarkaar ne iske liye 300 karod kaa hi praavdhaan kiya he jabaki vah paanch saal main 10,000 karod dene kii baat karti he
 In the budget of 2016-17, there is a matter of giving 500 crore every year to each of the 20 institutions, this amount is increased to 1000 crore in the next budget
 kya ham har saal 20 santhaan ko 1000 karod dekar paanch saal main 10,000 karod kharch kar top 200 kii ranking hasil kar sakate hai, vaise maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha he ki in sansthaanon ko agle paanch saal main ek hazaar karod tak diya jayega
 That is 200 crore to an institution every year
 200 karod main kya hoga
 If you are finding this amount too much, you are seeing milestones, then look at the budget of the University of America
 ise ham indowment fund bolte hai matlab itane paise kaa fund hai inke paas

 In the fiscal year ended 30 June 2017, Harvard University spent 33,638 crore
 harvard uniwarsity main 22,000 chaatr padhate hai
 Do you know how much is the budget of Bihar's estimated annual expenditure i
e
 9 crores
 bihar kaa is saal kaa bajet he 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod
 In 2016-17, Bihar spent 20,394 crores on higher education, sports, arts and culture
 isamen se 22 pratishat hissaa selary par karch hua
 In 2017-18, the share of salary in the budget of 26,394 crores decreased to 19
 5 ho gaya
 That is, a three percent drop in salary in a year
 matlab yah hua ki nae shikshak kam behaal hue
 Can any university in India match Harvard, Yale or Stanford? Why can't she do it but can't do 10,000 crores or this kind of attitude
 2016 main hi kaha gaya tha ki 20 sansthaanon kaa chunaav hoga lekin 2018 kaa aadha biit jane par 6 sansthaanon kaa elaan ho rahaa he, usamen se ek jeeyo institute abhi kaayam nahin hui he

 The Chief Minister of Manipur has also called and spoken to the President of Teachers Association
 ravivaar ko chaatro or shikshakon ne aarope lagaaya he ki uniwarsity campus main bahari tatwon ko bulaayaa gaya he taaki avyavashtha failaai ja sake
 Now that the time for talks is gone, the only solution is to have the Vice Chancellor removed
 adya prasad pandey oktober 2016 main vaais chancelar bane the
 Adya Prasad Pandey has been a student of Banaras Hindu University
 1979 se biechayu main padhaa rahe hai
 He was the chairman of bhu's economics department before becoming a VC of Manipur University
 kya aap jaanate hai ki desh kii 80 pratishat shiksha collejon main hoti he or unki haalat bahut karaab he
 90 percent of higher education is done in state universities whose condition is worse
 in par kya dhyaan diya ja rahaa he, kuch pataa nahin he
 i am mentioning this because on 9 July i
e
 today, the Minister of Human Resources has announced the Institute of Eminence
 prakaash jaavdekar ne twit kiya he ki ye landmark inishiative he yani mile kaa pathar sabit hone vaala kadam he
 He has tweeted because a panel of government experts has selected the institute of Eminence
 aaj ham 6 vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi jari kar rahe hai
 3 are government and 3 are private
 instituteofeminence desh ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 We have 800 universities but not a single university is in the top 100 or 200 in the world
 aaj ke faisle se hamen ye hasil karne main madad milegi
 There are no 115 teachers in Manipur University, not many colleges and universities like him, but India feels that the first task is to reach the top 100 or 200
 acha he, ye zid honi chahie magar ye dhun bhi honi chahie ki 95 fisadi chaatro ke liye uniwarsity or college hai wo kam se kam padhane or padhaane laayak ho saken
 It is not right to rely too much on ranking
 kahin isaki haalat tiarapy jaisi na ho jaae
 Prakash Javadekar gave a statement during Question Hour in Lok Sabha on 20 March 2017 that within a year, 9000 teachers will be appointed in Delhi University
 ek saal biit gaya
 This is the situation here in Delhi
 classroom main shikshakon ko niyukt karnaa bhi landmark disijan hona chahie magar ranking kii zid kaa aakarshan shaayad badi khabar he
 The six universities selected are IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
 in teen sansthaanon ke naam pehle bhi duniya kii ranking main aate rahe hai
 The Indian Institute of Science ranks between 251 and 300 in the Times Higher Education rankings
 iaiti dilli or bombai kaa sthaan 500 se 600 main he
 Apart from these three, one of the three private universities which are not known yet
 jeeyo institute bai reliance foundation, birla istitute of technolji and science-pilaani, manipal academy of hair ajukeshan
 Reliance's Jio Mobile and wifi have created a lot of upheaval in the telecom world
 magar jeeyo institute kya gul khilaaegaa, iskaa kya bajet hoga or kaise yah duniya kii privet uniwarsity ke baraabar pahonchega, abhi dekhte hai magar is suchi main jeeyo institute kaa naam dilachasp he
 We spoke to Furqan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities
 phurkan sahab kii ek baat main dam he
 Out of the ten institutes to be included in the Institute of Eminence, only one and a half percent of the students in higher education in the country will be very few
 99 pratishat chaatro ke liye kya ho rahaa he
 You can check the condition by going to the colleges of your states
 50 pratishat faikalti nahin hai yani teacher nahin hai
 Perhaps now this problem has been solved, the pace of fixing them will be so slow that it will not get publicity, but instead of spending big money on ten or twenty institutions and if they achieve rankings, then the headline will also be strong and cover story Will also look bright
 jidi college main 24 hazaar chaatr hai or shikshak 28 hi hai
 Many departments are empty, so why should any college come? ye bihar ke dainik bhaskar kii cliping he
 a teacher has an average of 1059 students
 kisi bhi lihaaz se yah ausat bhayankar he
 No single teacher can teach a thousand students
 daant chiar degaa
 This college is in Begusarai district of Bihar
 hamane apni uniwarsity series main isi zile ke ek or college shri krishna mahila college kaa haal bataaya tha
 There are ten and a half thousand girls and only 9 teachers
 ek shikshak par 1200 chatraayen
 i want to say that the need of these students of India is that of a teacher so that they too can get good education, but they are being shown the milestone by showing the dream of ranking ten universities
 yah usee tarah he ki railgadiyaan 30-40 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai or sapana bullate train kaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 You have to decide which priority you will choose
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke 100 saal hone ke maukey par pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 10 privet or 10 sarkari uniwarsity apana plan lekar aaen, bataaen ki kaise apana vikaas karenge, sarkaar unhen agle paanch saal main 10,000 karod degi
 We checked the record
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 bhartiya uniwarsity ko duniya kii top 200 main pahunchane ke liye ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya jayega
 But the Minister has issued a plan saying that it is expected that in the next ten years these institutions will come in the top 500 and after that in the top 100
 teen to top 500 main abhi se hai
 Where is the matter of the top 200 in the budget, but declaring the top 500
 sarkaar ne khud hi lakshya kam kar diya kya
 Not only this, it was talked about in the 2016 budget, but by the time half of 2018 has passed, the government has been able to issue a list of only 6 universities
 do dhai saal main aadhe se bhi kam kaa elaan hua he
 Now the matter of the budget was only in the budget of 2016-17, it was not the budget
 2017-18 ke bajet main maatr 50 karod kaa praavdhaan hua

 kya aap jaanate hai ki desh kii 80 pratishat shiksha collejon main hoti he or unki haalat bahut karaab he
 90 percent of higher education is in the state university , whose condition is worse
 in par kya dhyaan diya ja rahaa he, kuch pataa nahin he
 i am mentioning this because on 9 July i
e
 today, the Minister of Human Resources has announced the Institute of Eminence
 prakaash jaavdekar ne twit kiya he ki ye landmark inishiative he yani mile kaa pathar sabit hone vaala kadam he
 He has tweeted because a panel of government experts has selected the institute of Eminence
 aaj ham 6 vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi jari kar rahe hai
 3 are government and 3 are private
 instituteofeminence desh ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 We have 800 universities but not a single university is in the top 100 or 200 in the world
 aaj ke faisle se hamen ye hasil karne main madad milegi
 There are no 115 teachers in Manipur University, not many colleges and universities like him, but India feels that the first task is to reach the top 100 or 200
 acha he, ye zid honi chahie magar ye dhun bhi honi chahie ki 95 fisadi chaatro ke liye uniwarsity or college hai wo kam se kam padhane or padhaane laayak ho saken
 It is not right to rely too much on ranking
 kahin isaki haalat tiarapy jaisi na ho jaae
 Prakash Javadekar gave a statement during Question Hour in Lok Sabha on 20 March 2017 that within a year, 9000 teachers will be appointed in Delhi University
 ek saal biit gaya
 This is the situation here in Delhi
 classroom main shikshakon ko niyukt karnaa bhi landmark disijan hona chahie magar ranking kii zid kaa aakarshan shaayad badi khabar he
 The six universities selected are IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
 in teen sansthaanon ke naam pehle bhi duniya kii ranking main aate rahe hai
 The Indian Institute of Science ranks between 251 and 300 in the Times Higher Education rankings
 iaiti dilli or bombai kaa sthaan 500 se 600 main he
 Apart from these three, one of the three private universities which are not known yet
 jeeyo institute bai reliance foundation, birla istitute of technolji and science-pilaani, manipal academy of hair ajukeshan
 Reliance's Jio Mobile and wifi have created a lot of upheaval in the telecom world
 magar jeeyo institute kya gul khilaaegaa, iskaa kya bajet hoga or kaise yah duniya kii privet uniwarsity ke baraabar pahonchega, abhi dekhte hai magar is suchi main jeeyo institute kaa naam dilachasp he
 We spoke to Furqan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities
 phurkan sahab kii ek baat main dam he
 Out of the ten institutes to be included in the Institute of Eminence, only one and a half percent of the students in higher education in the country will be very few
 99 pratishat chaatro ke liye kya ho rahaa he
 You can check the condition by going to the colleges of your states
 50 pratishat faikalti nahin hai yani teacher nahin hai
 Perhaps now this problem has been solved, the pace of fixing them will be so slow that it will not get publicity, but instead of spending big money on ten or twenty institutions and if they achieve rankings, then the headline will also be strong and cover story Will also look bright
 jidi college main 24 hazaar chaatr hai or shikshak 28 hi hai
 Many departments are empty, so why should any college come? ye bihar ke dainik bhaskar kii cliping he
 a teacher has an average of 1059 students
 kisi bhi lihaaz se yah ausat bhayankar he
 No single teacher can teach a thousand students
 daant chiar degaa
 This college is in Begusarai district of Bihar
 hamane apni uniwarsity series main isi zile ke ek or college shri krishna mahila college kaa haal bataaya tha
 There are ten and a half thousand girls and only 9 teachers
 ek shikshak par 1200 chatraayen
 i want to say that the need of these students of India is that of a teacher so that they too can get good education, but they are being shown the milestone by showing the dream of ranking ten universities
 yah usee tarah he ki railgadiyaan 30-40 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai or sapana bullate train kaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 You have to decide which priority you will choose
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke 100 saal hone ke maukey par pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 10 privet or 10 sarkari uniwarsity apana plan lekar aaen, bataaen ki kaise apana vikaas karenge, sarkaar unhen agle paanch saal main 10,000 karod degi
 We checked the record
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 bhartiya uniwarsity ko duniya kii top 200 main pahunchane ke liye ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya jayega
 But the Minister has issued a plan saying that it is expected that in the next ten years these institutions will come in the top 500 and after that in the top 100
 teen to top 500 main abhi se hai
 Where is the matter of the top 200 in the budget, but declaring the top 500
 sarkaar ne khud hi lakshya kam kar diya kya
 Not only this, it was talked about in the 2016 budget, but by the time half of 2018 has passed, the government has been able to issue a list of only 6 universities
 do dhai saal main aadhe se bhi kam kaa elaan hua he
 Now the matter of the budget was only in the budget of 2016-17, it was not the budget
 2017-18 ke bajet main maatr 50 karod kaa praavdhaan hua
 What could have happened to that money, only the government can tell because between 2017-18, the list of Institute of Eminence did not come up

 manipur uniwarsity main 115 teacher nahin hai, uske jaise na jane kitne college or uniwarsity main teacher nahin hai magar bharat ko lagata he ki pehla kaam top 100 yaa 200 main aa janaa he
 It is good, it should be stubborn, but it should also be tuned that there are universities and colleges for 95 per cent students, at least they should be able to read and teach
 ranking par bahut adhik bharosa karnaa thik nahin hota he
 Somewhere its condition does not become like TRP
 prakaash jaavdekar ne 20 march 2017 ko loksabhaa main prashn kaal ke dauraan bayaan diya tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity main 9000 shikshak niyukt kar denge
 a year passed
 yaheen dilli main ye haal he
 Appointing teachers in the classroom should also be a landmark decision, but the stubbornness of the rankings is probably big news
 jin chah uniwarsity kaa chayan hua he unamem naam hai iaiti dilli, iaiti bombai, indian istitute of science bangaloru bhi shaamil hai
 The names of these three institutions have been in the world ranking even earlier
 times hair ajukeshan ranking main indian istitute of science kaa sthaan 251 se 300 ke bich he
 IIT Delhi and Bombay are ranked between 500 and 600
 in teenon ke alaava jo teen privet uniwarsity hai unamem se ek ke bare main abhi kuch khaas pataa nahin he
 Jio Institute by Reliance Foundation, Birla Institute of Technology and science-pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education
 reliance kaa jeeyo mobile or wifai ne telecom kii duniya main kaaphi uthal puthal machaa di he
 But what will the Jio Institute feed, what will be its budget and how will it reach the private universities of the world, let's see now, but the name of Jio Institute is interesting in this list
 hamane association of indian uniwarsity ke mahasachiv furqaan qamar se baat kii
 Furkan Sahab has a point
 jin das sansthaanon ko institute of eminance main shaamil kiya janaa he usamen ucch shiksha main desh bhar ke chaatro kaa sava pratishat chaatr hi honge jo ki bahut kam hai
 What's happening to 99 percent of the students
 aap apane-apane rajyon ke collejon main jaakar haalat dekh sakate hai
 50 percent are not faculty, that is, not teachers
 shaayad ab yah samasya belgaum ho chuki he, inhen thik karne kii raftaar itani dhimi hogi ki usase prachaar nahin hoga magar isaki jagah das bees sansthaanon par bada paisa kharch kiya jaae or ve ranking hasil kar len to use lekar hedline bhi tagdi banegi or cover story bhi chamakdaar lagegi
 GD College has 24,000 students and 28 teachers
 kai vibhaag khaali hai to koi college aae hi kyon
 This is a clipping of Dainik Bhaskar of Bihar
 ek shikshak par 1059 chaatr kaa ausat he
 In any sense, this average is terrible
 koi bhi akelaa shikshak ek hazaar chaatro ko padhaa hi nahin saktaa he
 Gives teeth yah college bihar ke begusarai zile main he
 In our university series, we told about the condition of another college of Shri Krishna Mahila College in this district
 vahaan saadhe das hazaar chatraayen hai or maatr 9 shikshak hai
 1200 girls on one teacher
 main kahana yah chahta hum ki zarurat bharat ke in chaatro ko shikshak kii he taaki ve bhi acchhee padhai hasil kar saken magar unhen das uniwarsity kii ranking kaa sapana dikhaa kar mile kaa pathar bataaya ja rahaa he

 On the occasion of 100 years of Patna University, Prime Minister Modi had said that 10 private and 10 government universities should bring their plan, tell how they will develop themselves, the government will give them 10,000 crore in the next five years
 hamane record check kiya
 In the 2016-17 budget, a blueprint will be prepared to make 20 Indian universities among the top 200 in the world
 magar mantri ji ne plan jari karte hue kaha he ki ummid he ki agle das saal main ye santhaan top 500 main aa jaaenge or uske baad top 100 main
 Three are still in the top 500
 kahaan to bajet main top 200 kii baat he magar elaan karte hue top 500 ho gaya
 Did the government itself reduce the target? yahi nahin, 2016 ke bajet main isaki baat thi magar 2018 aadha biit gaya tab tak sarkaar sirf 6 uniwarsity kii hi list jari kar saki he
 Less than half has been announced in two and a half years
 ab rahi bajet kii baat to 2016-17 ke bajet main sirf baat thi, bajet nahin tha
 Provision of only 50 crores in the budget of 2017-18
 us paise kaa kya hua hoga, sarkaar hi bataa sakati he kyonki 2017-18 ke bich to institute of eminance kii suchi hi nahin ai
 The 2018-19 budget has a fund of 250 crore in the name of a world-class institution
 agar bajet dekhen to abhi tak sarkaar ne iske liye 300 karod kaa hi praavdhaan kiya he jabaki vah paanch saal main 10,000 karod dene kii baat karti he
 In the budget of 2016-17, there is a matter of giving 500 crore every year to each of the 20 institutions, this amount is increased to 1000 crore in the next budget
 kya ham har saal 20 santhaan ko 1000 karod dekar paanch saal main 10,000 karod kharch kar top 200 kii ranking hasil kar sakate hai, vaise maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha he ki in sansthaanon ko agle paanch saal main ek hazaar karod tak diya jayega
 That is 200 crore to an institution every year
 200 karod main kya hoga
 If you are finding this amount too much, you are seeing milestones, then look at the budget of the University of America
 ise ham indowment fund bolte hai matlab itane paise kaa fund hai inke paas

 In 2016-17, Bihar spent 20,394 crores on higher education, sports, arts and culture
 isamen se 22 pratishat hissaa selary par karch hua
 In 2017-18, the share of salary in the budget of 26,394 crores decreased to 19
 5 ho gaya
 That is, a three percent drop in salary in a year
 matlab yah hua ki nae shikshak kam behaal hue
 Can any university in India match Harvard, Yale or Stanford? Why can't she do it but can't do 10,000 crores or this kind of attitude
 2016 main hi kaha gaya tha ki 20 sansthaanon kaa chunaav hoga lekin 2018 kaa aadha biit jane par 6 sansthaanon kaa elaan ho rahaa he, usamen se ek jeeyo institute abhi kaayam nahin hui he
 Don't be disappointed, Harvard University was established in 1636, Yale University was formed in 1701 and Stanford in 1891
 harvard or yel ke pehle kaa to aapako kya milegaa, main dukhi nahin karnaa chahta
 Prior to Stanfort, Aligarh Muslim University, Allahabad University, Kolkata University and Madras University were established in India

 You can check the condition by going to the colleges of your states

 There was a time when Ranji cricket used to be the way of selection in the Indian team
 lekin badalte daur or khel ke tareekon ke saath-saath chayan kaa paimaana bhi badal gaya
 The Indian Premier League (IPL) has not only rained heavily on players, but has also realized the dream of playing in Team India
 rabindra jadeja, mohit sharma, saurabh tiwari, parvinder awana, manpreet singh goni, stuart binni, rahul sharma or sudeep tyaagi kuch aise khilaadi hai jinhone ipel ke raste team india main jagah banaai
 This season too, there are some players who can come forward and submit their claim in Team India
 ye hai wo khilaadi jinhone jagaai he ummid:deepak hooda:ipel jaise bade stage par is ballebaaj ne bahut kam umr main bade-bade diggajon kaa dil jeeta he
 This batsman has played a very important role in the Rajasthan Royals' brilliant journey so far
 bade stage par na sirf khilaadi kaa tallent myne rakhata he balki temprament bhi kaaphi mahatvapurn hota he
 The fearlessness with which this 19-year-old young batsman has washed away the world class bowlers clearly shows his talent
 ballebaaji ke saath-saath ye part time spin gendbaaji bhi karaane main sakasham hai
 Hooda, who played Ranji for Baroda, has also shown a lot in domestic cricket
 unhone 8 first class maichon main 50
 Has scored 557 runs at an excellent average of 63
 aane vaale samay main agar yahi concystancy jari rahi to hooda ek din team india main jarur shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 Mayank Agarwal: Delhi Daredevils opener Mayank Agarwal is a player who knows how to build his innings
 match main kab aakraamak hona he, kab wicket par tikkar khelnaa hai yah baat mayank ko khub pataa he
 Regarding Mayank, who gave Daredevils their first win in IPL 2015, Yuvraj Singh also believes that this player has the ability to play international cricket
 mayank karnataka ke liye gharelu cricket khelte hai
 He made 31 in 13 matches in first class cricket
 42 kii ausat se 597 ran banaae hai
 Sandeep Sharma: Fast bowler Sandeep Sharma has a tremendous art of swinging the new ball on both sides
 kings ilevan punjab main mishael johnson ko chhodkar koi bhi bada naam gendbaaji main nahin he
 But Sandeep has never let it go with his skill
 kings ilevan punjab bowling coach or team india ke purv bowling coach jo dawes bhi sandip kii gendbaaji se khaase prabhavit hai
 Dawes has said that not yet, but one day Sandeep will definitely play for India
 21 varshiya sandip ne 27 first class maichon main 111 wicket jatke hai
 Suryakumar Yadav: 24-year-old Suryakumar Yadav is making a mark in the IPL for Kolkata Knight Riders
 pichley ipel sijan main yadav ko finishr kii bhoomika di gai
 But this time he has made more improvement in his batting and now he is ready to play any role for the team
 nite rides ke menter jaik kallis suryakumar kii ballebaaji se behad prabhavit hai
 Suryakumar is a particularly suitable player for T20 cricket
 suryakumar ke shorts se prabhavit kallis ne to yah tak kah diya ki mujhe is ballebaaj se kuch shorts khelnaa siikhnaa he
 Suryakumar scored 45 in 35 first class matches
 03 kii shandaar everej ke saath 2342 ran banaae hai
 Manan Vohra: Kings XI Punjab's top order batsman Manan Vohra is not getting much opportunities these days, but he is a long race horse
 pichley saal salaami ballebaaj kii bhoomika nibhaate hue 21 varshiya vohara punjab ke liye kaaphi concystant rahe the, lekin is saal murali vijay ke aane se unhen team main maukey nahin mil rahe hai
 But the type of his technique and temperament, he can definitely present his claim in the coming time
 haalanki gharelu cricket main unke aankade unki pratibha ke anuroop nahin he
 He scored 28 in 10 first class matches
 22 kii maamuli ausat se 508 ran banaae hai
 Consistency is very important in cricket along with talent
 in sabhi khilaadiyon main jabardast tallent he lekin inhen niyamit rup se gharelu cricket main behatar pradarshan karnaa padegaa, tabhi in khilaadiyon ke liye team india ke dwaar khulenge

 maansik santulan kho baithi he leelise bhayanak haadase ne lila ko maansik taur par behad kamjor bana diya he, ab vah bolti nahin balki bas muskuraati bhar he
 People who have lost their loved ones in this tragedy are coming to meet Leela
 in logon ne lila ko apane parijanon ke photo bhi dikhaae taaki shaayad inamen se kisi ko lila pahchaan le, lekin lila kisi ko nahin pahchaan paa rahi
 Vijender unites day and night to find Leela
 vijender ne 18 maheene lila kii photo lekar pahaado kaa konaa-konaa chaan maaraa
 In the end, Vijender wins and gets his lead
 vijender singh kaa kahana he ki us traasadee ke baad uttarakhand main pagal hone vaale logon kii sankhya badi he
 Most are those who have gone mad with shock

 — King Mika Singh (@mikasingh)february 4, 2015 The political situation in Philhalbahar is the same factor that is getting painful for BJP in Delhi
 maanjhi or nitish ke jhagade kaa puraa lutf bijepi uthaa rahi he
 He tries to take as much benefit as possible from this quarrel
 bihar ke is khel membijapi hi aisi party hajiske paas maukey hi maukey hai
 First chance: BJP is just waiting for none of Manjhi and Nitish to prove their majority in the assembly
 aise main rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagegaa jo bijepi ke liye sabase phydemand hoga
 Second chance: BJP will benefit as much as Manjhi can do to JDU
 bijepi chaah rahi he ki ye khel apane clymex par pahunche
 However, a section of the BJP is advocating to support the government from outside by voting in favor of Manjhi
 bijepi netaa khule taur par sirf itnaa hi kah rahe hai ki unka yah vikalp khulaa he
 Third chance: In the event of Manjhi not being able to prove majority, BJP is considering this strategy to encourage them to form their own party
 agar maanjhi apni party bana lete hai to bijepi ko khul kar aage nahin aana padegaa
 The BJP does not want to offend the upper castes
 jo maanjhi ko pasand nahin karte
 Fourth chance: Nitish Kumar is the most under pressure in this entire development
 bijepi chaahegi ki ye halaat you hi bane rahen taaki nitish galatiyon par galtiyaan karte jaaen
 Whether through statements or by their decisions
 taaki un galatiyon ko chunaav main mudde ke rup main bhunaane kaa mauka rahegaa
 Fifth chance: BJP will give more consideration to small losses than big losses by supporting Manjhi in the assembly
 bijepi ke liye chota nuksaan yahi he ki vah nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ban jane de or chunaavon main anti-inkambency factor kaa phayda uthaae
 By the way, BJP also likes this way too much
 pichley chunaav is baat ke gavaah hai

 Sri Sri also said that he is fully confident of finding a solution to the Ayodhya issue

 Owaisi said in Delhi on Tuesday that he appealed to the Supreme Court to hear the Ayodhya case after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as the issue was being politicized
 ovasi ke mutabik agar is maamle kii sunwaayee 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad hoti he to koi fark nahin padegaa
 Owaisi said why no one raised his finger on those who are threatening to become India of Syria
 is tarah ke bayaan wo dete hai jo bhartiya samvidhan yaa supreme court main vishwaas nahin rakhte
 Owaisi also spoke of receiving threats
 bareli main ‘aaj tak’ se baatcheet main itihaad-e-millat ke pramukh moulana tawqir raja ne kaha ki shri shri ravishankar desh prem kii bhaavana se kaam kar rahe hai
 Whatever works for good, people who believe in goodness should also be supported
 tawqir raja ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak unki baat ko maine samajha wo ye he ki court se jo faisla hoga wo ek paksh ke liye khushi kii baat hogi or duusare paksh ke liye gam kii baat hogi
 One will celebrate Shaurya Day and the other will celebrate Black Day
 aisa maahaul banegaa to desh ke halaat bigadane kaa khatra he
 It should be that before the court's decision, as an human being, an attempt should be made to persuade the two sides to negotiate
 agar baatcheet out of court kii ja sakati he to ye koshish kerani chahie
 If it is successful in reaching a conclusion, then it is no better thing
 agar aisa nahin hota to phir jaisaa chal rahaa he, vaise hi chalane diya jaae yani court ke faisle kaa intjaar kiya jaae
 Tauqeer Raza also stressed that as a human being, it should be the responsibility of all the people, not of us and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, that in any case, the riots should not be allowed to create an atmosphere of violence
 tawqir raja ne kaha ki wo sabhi log jo hindustan main ekta or bhaichaare main yakeen rakhte hai, secularism main yakeen rakhte hai, is kaam ke liye aage aaen
 When Tauqir Raza was asked what is the solution to the matter, he said, 'solution i told that we will try to get the two sides to sit together
 donon kii sharton ke aadhaar par koi samjhauta ban saktaa he to wo koshish kii jaani chahie
 There has also been talk with the Nirmohi Akhara
 ek vishwa hindu parishad kaa maamla hamen lagata he ki vah kisi bhi surat main nahin chahenge ki out of court main maamla tay ho
 Some such people are also on our side
 vishwa hindu parishad kahati he hamaari aasthaa badi he to aasthaa hamaari bhi he
 Our faith is very big and is not less than anyone
 lekin aasthaa ke naam par dange fasaad karnaa yah munasib nahin he
 Whoever is doing this job or wants to do it does not love their country
 vah desh kaa gaddaar he
 We should work for hindu-muslim unity
 iske liye jo qurbaani deni pade wo ham dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 'tauqir Raza said,' Those who are opposing Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, i understand that they are not good people
 shri shri ravishankar jaise log agar hindustan main hai to hindustan main abhi insaaniyat baaki he, aisa meraa maananaa he
 Clap rings with both hands, need to shake hands
 aaj hamane or shri shri ravishankar ne haath milaayaa he
 The effort will be that soon we can also sit the two sides together and prepare them to move towards consensus
 ’tawqir raja ne asaduddin ovaisi ke is bayaan ko lekar asahmati jataai ki shri shri ravishankar par syria vaale bayaan ko lekar cese darj kar diya janaa chahie
 According to Tauqir Raza, whoever works to provoke them in the name of the rights of Muslims, is the enemy of the country in my eyes
 ayodhya vivaad ko court ke baahar sulajhane kii vakaalat karne vaale art of living ke pramukh shri shri ravishankar ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki yah maamla nahin sulajhaa to desh syria ban jayega
 He had said, 'ayodhya is not a religious place for Muslims
 unhen is dharmik sthal par apana daawa chhod kar misaal pesh kerani chahie
 If the decision is made by the court, then one side will have to accept defeat
 aise halaat main haara hua paksh abhi to maan jayega, lekin kuch samay baad phir bavaal shuru hoga
 Which will not be good for the society

 sachin ne nijee kaarnon se chuttee le lee he, jiske liye vah niyamon ke aadhaar par sahi hai, duusari ore rekha mangalvaar ko sansad bhawan main dikhin
 Now the question is whether Rekha or Sachin's absence in Rajya Sabha is a matter of debate
 haa, yadi aap bahes karne par utaaru hai to kar sakate hai, magar yah koi aisa mudda nahin he jo kisi ko prabhavit karata ho
 Sachin's contribution to this country will not be less than any of the 780 mps, he is Bharat Ratna
 rajyasabha main apana manonayan unhone maanga nahin tha
 You awarded him this post yourself
 sachin ne dilli main koi sarkari makaan nahin liya
 Did not take any facilities related to it
 yahaan to aise saansad bhi aapako milenge jo roj ke 2000 kaa bhatta lene ke liye sansad aate hai
 Signs the register and goes away
 780 main se kitne saansadon ko aap jaanate hai jinhone apane puure kaarykaal main paanch baar bhi apni baat rakhi hogi
 If i give the figures of the 16th Lok Sabha, then perhaps the matter will be clear
 16veen loksabhaa main 197 loksabhaa saansadon ne paanch saal main ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha, to 265 loksabhaa saansadon ne paanch se kam sawaal puche
 At the same time, 70 mps in Rajya Sabha did not ask any questions and 79 mps asked less than five questions
 yadi 50 saansadon ko chhod den jo ki roj tivi ke bakse main bahes ke program main aate hai to baakiyon kaa naam bhi aapako nahin maaloom honge
 Then if a nominated MP is not able to come for any reason then why so much controversy
 kya kisi ko is baat kaa dhyaan he ki trinmul se rajyasabha ke saansad mithun chakravarti kahaan hai
 He has come to this session one day and has taken leave for the entire session as per rules
 hemamalini bhi is satr main do teen baar hi dikhi hai
 However, she is an elected Lok Sabha MP and represents Mathura
 mathura main unke gumshuda hone ke poster bhi lag gaye the
 If you remember the days of NDA, Lata Mangeshkar was also rarely in Rajya Sabha
 aisa nahin he ki manonith sadsy sadan kii kaarywahi main kam hissaa lete hai
 Currently Javed Akhtar is very active
 yahi nahin, unhone puure sadan main amrai bana kar copirite bill bhi paas karavaaya jisase lekhakon geetkaaron ko roylty milegi
 Be it Shyam Benegal or Dilip Kumar or Mrinal Sen, they were also active in their days
 koi kam to koi zyada, yani rajyasabha kaa manonayan ek sajaavati oopaadhi yaa kahen ek sammaan he jo us shakhsiyat ko diya jaataa he jisane desh ke liye koi badi uplabdhi hasil kii ho
 But, what to do In Parliament, the competition to gain cheap popularity among some people, the mentality of selling news of 24-hour news channels has at times also made the point which does not even get your attention
 aravind kejariwal kii mushkilen khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Recently, a big fraud was revealed in the Public Works Department of the Delhi Government on Friday
 PWD main karodon kaa yah ghotaalaa nirmaan or rakrakhaav ke naam par hua he
 It is being told that there has been an open loot of the state exchequer in the hail of contracts of roads and drains in Delhi
 bina bilon ke thekedaaron ko karodon kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya he
 There has been a scam of crores in the payment of bills in every zone of Delhi
 peedbludy mantri satyendra jain kii naak ke neeche hi yah puraa khel chal rahaa he
 According to the evidence available with 'aaj Tak', there is a scam going on in the construction department of the Delhi government and every officer is involved from top to bottom
 in records ke mutabik dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody vibhaag ne dilli ke 198 jagahon par rupayon kaa bhugtan bagaiyr bill ke kar diya
 And there is no record of the bill on the basis of which billions of rupees were distributed to the contractors
 sutron ke mutabik asaliyat to ye he ki bina nirmaan yaa marammat kaary karaaye dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon main thekedaar farji bill lagaakar karodon rupayon kaa bhugtan lete rahe or vibhaag chupchaap aankh band karke dekhtaa rahaa
 Even the people to whom the government paid crores did not get the work done in reality
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud dastavej bataate hai ki kaise saal 2014-15 main satyendra jain ke mantri rahete huye dilli kii tamaam sadakon or naalon kii marammat or safai kaa kaam kanoon ko taak par rakhkar kai aise thekedaaron ko diya jinke bhugtan kaa record naa to peedblyoody vibhaag ke paas he naa hi sarkaar ke cells tex vibhaag ke paas or naa hi khud thekedaar ke paas
 How the PWD department of Delhi government passed government contracts without bills and rules was revealed by the RTI reply of the construction department
 darasal, dilli sarkaar ke antargat aane vaali sadakon or naalon ke nirmaan or marammat kaa jimmaa dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody vibhaag ke paas hota he
 For which contractors are asked to work under the prescribed rules and after completion of the work, full payment is made on the basis of checks and bills
 lekin, adhikariyon ne thekedaaron ke saath milakar aisa gorakhdhandha shuru kiya ki bagaiyr bilon ke hi puraa bhugtan kar diya gaya
 When the reply was sought under RTI, the reply was received that we do not have any record of the bills paid
 is gorakhdhandhe se dilli main ek-do nahin balki saikadon jagah par ghotaalaa kiya gaya or sarkari khajaanon ko kareeb 200 karod kaa chuunaa lagaaya gaya
 According to the information, the engineers of the PWD department gave the contract of repair and maintenance work in Delhi where it was not needed or it was difficult to identify by looking at those places to execute their plot
 Whether any construction work has been done at all
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud dilli sarkaar ke un kaamon kii fehrist he jise dekhakar saaf pataa chalaa he ki jin jagahon par kaam karaayaa gaya dikhaaya gaya he wo darasal behad sandehaaspad he or jinhen dekhakar kahana mushkil he ki kaam hua kya he
 Even more surprising is that the contractors who were tasked by the Delhi government to get the work, they claimed to get work for 60 to 70 percent less than the fixed cost for getting the contract, ie the work for which the quality rules According to the government had a budget of 100 rupees, the contractors agreed to do it for 30-40 rupees, which was not possible
 makasad saaf he, tay keemat se aadhe se bhi kam laagat main kaam karaane kaa theka lene ke peeche ashanka he ki ye saare kaam vastav main kiye hi nahin gayi or naa hi iske liye koi saamaan kii construction materiel kii kharid-farokht kii gayi or bina bilon ke sarkaar ne bhi thekedaaron ko bhugtan kar diya
 Now let's put on some similar tasks
 
 
 cese- 1jagah-ignu road, purana mehrauli badarpur road, phirani rodkam-naale ko sudhaarney or aaremasi nirmaan kaaryakharcha-3,26,26,450 rupetheka-varun gupta and companycontractor-varun guptasana 2014-15 main dilli ke ignu road, purana mehrauli road or phirani road ke naalon kii marammat or nirmaan kaary ke liye theka diya gaya
 According to the allegations, no work was done at these places
 artiai main jab in jagahon par huye kaam ke bhugtan, raseedon or records ke bare main jaankaree maangi gayi to jawaab mila wo hairaan karne vaala tha
 PWD replied - We have not kept any such record because according to the agreement no such record is required to be kept
 jab 'ajtak' kii team ne in jagahon par ja kar dekha to pataa chalaa ki mehrauli road par to koi open naala hi nahin he
 After that the team reached another site near Mehrauli
 is road par marammat or naale ke rakrakhaav kaa kaam kiya gaya tha lekin ignu road ke naale kii marammat or nirmaan kii asaliyat kuch or hi thi
 After this, the team of 'aaj Tak' turned to the company that did this work
 saket main bani varun gupta and company kaa daftar rihaayshi ilaake main he
 Nominal staff in office
 hamane jab inase sawaal kiye to das tareeke ke bahaane bataae gaye
 But no answer was given as to where are the records based on which the government got a pennant of about Rs 3 crore
 khayr record nahin milanaa tha or bahaane tamaam the
 But, the PWD department's reply in RTI has already made it clear that there is no record of the work for which crores were paid
 san 2014 main dobaaraa satta main aane ke baad aam aadmi party ne dilli kii sadakon or naalon ko durust karne kaa bidaa uthaaya tha or iske liye jimmedaar vibhaag ke mukhiya the aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa or mantri satyendra jain
 The same Satyendra Jain whose arbitrary and law-abiding cases are coming out one by one
 sabooton ke mutabik satyendra jain ke vibhaag ke ejeeniyar or thekedaaron ne milakar dilli kii kareeb 200 sadakon or naalon kii marammat kaa jimmaa liya jinamein se zyaadaatar jagahen or kaam kii detail aisi he jise pahchaan paanaa bhi mushkil he
 The details of the work on the documents are written in such a way that it is not possible to find what exactly
 satyendra jainake lok nirmaan vibhaag ne dilli ke har kone main siver or sadak thik karne kaa jimmaa alag-alag contractor ko diya lekin kamaal kii baat he ki har jagah kaam ke naam par sirf ghotaalaa hi kiya gaya
 We are not referring to the papers of PWD department itself
 cese- 2jagah-dilli kaa kalka ji, rampura main road or pratap nagar rodkam-siver ke sudhaar or footpath banane kakhrch-3,88,19,934 rupetheka-new bharat consatruction companycontractor-mukhtaar ahmadajab in jagahon par kaam karne kii jaanch kii gai to kahin bhi isaki tasdik nahin ho paayi
 No nomination was found to show that any work of sewer improvement and construction has been done at these places
 yani matlab saaf tha yahaan bhi kaam sirf kaagajon par hi kiya gaya tha
 So Aaj Tak's team thought it right to check the papers
 dilli kii enjio rocco yani ki 'road anti karpshan orgenigeshan' kii artiai ke jawaab main diye gayi sabooton ke mutabik peedblyoody vibhaag jamaa kiye kagajaton ke hisaab se theka lene vaali new bharat consatruction company ne kaam karne ke liye jin jagahon se saamaan kharida wo the vinayak cells or karthik trading jo ki donon hi dilli kii companiyaan hai
 According to Mukhtar Ahmed's company New Bharat Construction, the goods he bought for construction and repair were purchased from these places
 jinke bill baqayda peedblyoody vibhaag main jamaa kiye gayi
 But when asked about these material suppliers, Vinayak Sales said that he never did any business dealing with New India Company
 unhone is baat kaa bakaayaada likhit dastavej bhi diya
 Apart from this, it was also revealed that there is no company named Karthik Trading Company
 is baat kii tasdik cells tex vibhaag ne likhit rup se kii
 Despite this, the PWD department gave the full payment of this work i
e
 about 4 crore rupees without any investigation
 vajah saaf thi siver or nirmaan ke liye jis kaam ke liye vibhaag karodon rupaye lutaa rahaa tha wo kaam darasal hua hi nahin tha
 If you talk about the pleas and replies of the PWD department in response to the RTI, then only paper forts are made in each contract
 dilli ke siver or nirmaan ke kaam main saare niyamon ko taak par rakh kar naa sirf theke diye gayi balki pement karne main to kanoon kii dhajjiyaan udaane kii hadein paar kar di gayi
 In nearly half a dozen works, the RTI answers and our investigation found that either no work has been done and payment has been taken on fake bill or if such work has been done, then it is of such poor quality, in return for which PWD department Clearly indicates complicity
 cese- 3jagah-dilli kaa britania chowk ilaakakam-guru harikishan maarg ke paas britania chowk kii road number 43 kii marammatkharcha-15,32,11,811 rupetheka-em consatruction companycontractor-mohammad ikbalartiaike jawaab se to saaf tha ki yahaan bhi bilon ke farjivade se karodon kii rakam peedblyoody ke bhrasht adhikariyon or kantractor ke bich dakaari ja chuki he
 However, the team till date thought of taking stock of the area itself
 nateeja ye mila ki is jagah par koi kaam hua hi nahin
 The same situation turned out to pay contracts for footpaths and drains in Phase Three area of ashok Vihar in Delhi
 san 2014-15 main kareeb 8 karod rupee kaa theka dilli kii emasi construction company ko diya gaya jisamen malik issar maarg par kaam kiya janaa tha
 But, nothing happened
 ab is par bhi peedblyoo vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii meharbaani dekhiye ki bagaiyr kaayade-kanoon kii parvaah kiye lagbhag 8 karod rupayon kaa pement to karvaa diya lekin jab artiai ke jariye bill or records kaa jawaab maanga gaya to jawaab mila ki pement ke baad bill or raseed kaa rakhaa janaa jaruri nahin he
 Surrounding the government on inflation, Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj blamed the policies of the government for this
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke die aankadon se garib kaa pet nahin bharegaa
 Sushma also said that during the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai, inflation was controlled, but Congress governments have failed
 loksabhaa main hue is hamale kaa jawaab vitt mantri ne rajyasabha main diya
 Pranab Mukherjee said that not only the Center is responsible for inflation but also the states
 isse pehle, 2ji ghotaale ko lekar grih mantri pi chidambaram ke istife tathaa anya muddon ko lekar vipaksh dwaara kiye gaye baari hangaame ke kaaran loksabhaa kii baithak shuru hone ke kuch hi minute baad dopaher 12 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 When the proceedings resumed at 12, the situation remained the same and the ruckus continued in the House
 adhyaksh mira kumaar ke baar-baar kehane ke baavjood jab vipakshi saansad shant nahin hue, to sadan kii kaarywahi dobaaraa dopaher 2 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 At the commencement of the proceedings of the House in the morning, members of the Janata Dal (U) started shouting slogans in front of the seat demanding Chidambaram's resignation
 endie ke pramukh dal bhaajapa ke sadsy bhi apane sthaan par khadey hokar yahi maang karte dekhe gaye
 On the other hand, AIADMK and PMK members from Tamil Nadu came in front of the posture regarding the Mullaperiyar dam issue
 sattarudh samprag ke ghatak dal dramuk ke tiaar baaluu bhi apane sthaan par khadey hokar sadan main mullaperiyar baandh par charchaa karaae jane kii maang kar rahe the
 Chairman Meera Kumar appealed to allow the Question Hour to run, but it had no effect on the members and the uproar continued
 sthiti shant nahin hote dekh unhone baithak kuch hi minute baad dopaher 12 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 The Union Public Service Commission has announced the date for the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) 2015 examination

 kyonki vah raat ke andhere main nikalataa he or sote insaanon ko maut ke ghat utaar kar phir se andhere main gum ho jaataa he
 Where he passes, there are not many corpses
 lekin naa to vah lutpaat ke liye jaan le rahaa he or naa hi maranevaalon se uski koi dushmani he
 After all, who is this person who wanders around in the city of Shirdi, Sai? The sleep of Shirdi city, usually lost in the devotion of Sai Baba, has been blown up by a strange incident these days
 sirf raat ke andhere main hone vaali ye vaardaat apane peeche hansate-bolte logon kii laashen chhod jaati hai
 The latest incident in this case came on 29 July
 subah ke kareeb 8 baje shiridy main ahmednagar-manamaad haive jindagi puri raftaar se daud rahi thi
 But then people caught sight of the corpse lying outside a hotel
 upree taur par to ye laash, laash kam or ek soya hua insaan zyaada lagata tha
 But when we tried to awaken this sleeping person, a scary truth came out
 kaafii koshish ke baad bhi jab us aadmi main koi halchal nahin hui or chadar ke neeche se risataa khun dikhaayi diya to saaf ho gaya ki ye aadmi jinda nahin he or ye koi maamuli maut nahin, balki katl he
 Just before the police could find the corpse and find the killer, another news forced him to leave for a new hideout
 or ye jagah is pehali mauka-e-vaardaat se zyada dur bhi nahin thi
 Around 8 in the morning
 30 baje the or pehali laash vaali jagah ke kareeb hi nagar-manamaad hive par bane sarkari guest house ke najadik ek or laash padi hone kii khabar police ko mili
 The corpse lay with a shutter of a shop a short distance from the road
 roj kii tarah aaj bhi jab dukandaar apane kaam-kaaj ke silsile main dukaan par pahunchaa to shater ke baahar padi laash ko dekhakar uske kadam thithak gaye
 But the strange thing was that this corpse, like the earlier corpse, was covered with a sheet just like a man was sleeping
 lekin yahaan bhi chadar ke aas-paas bikharaa khun is insaan ke katl kii gavaahi de rahaa tha
 Then the news of another incident also shocked the police
 abhi subah ke paune 9 baje the or duusari vaardaat kii jagah se thodi duuri par gyaneshwar mandir ke paas ek or laash padi mili
 Here too, the corpse was covered with sheets like both earlier incidents
 is khabar ko pate hi police turant nae thikaane kii ore ravaanaa ho gai
 The police noticed that the scene here was similar to the previous two incidents
 yahaan mandir se thodi dur kheton ke paas chadar se dhaki ek laash padi thi
 Seeing this corpse, it seemed that like the first two corpses, it was killed by crushing it with something heavy
 ab saaf tha ki in laashon kaa ek-duusare se koi naa koi rishta jarur tha
 Because on one side all the dead bodies were covered with sheets, on the other hand heavy stones or bricks were also found near all the dead bodies
 aise main chand kilometre or chand minute ke faasale par padin ye laashen mahaz ittefaq nahin ho sakati thim
 So were all these murderers the same? If yes, who was he and why was he taking the lives of the people? Police may not have reached this serial killer or his secret till now, but the picture of this serial killer is definitely with him
 or to or ek sisitivi footage main ye killer baqayada ek shaks kii jaan letaa hua dikh rahaa he
 But still Shirdi's police are looking for this killer in the dark
 ek gumnaam serial killer kii talash main lagi shiridy police ko sainagar stesan se jo sisitivi footage mili he, wo rongte khadey karne vaali he
 The CCTV here has live pictures of the serial killer who is wandering around in the darkness of night
 or in tasveeron main naa sirf us kaatil kaa cheharaa kaid he, balki isamen wo apane haathon se ek shaks kii jaan letaa hua bhi dikhaai de rahaa he
 Questions have been continuously raised about the safety of women in Mumbai Local

 Lord Shiva has told Maa Parvati about the importance of peacocks mentioned in ornithology
 pracheen kaal main sandhya naam kaa ek asur hua tha
 He was a very powerful and ascetic asura
 guru shukacharya ke kaaran sandhya devataaon kaa shatru ban gaya tha
 Sandhya Asura pleased Shiva and Brahma by doing harsh penance

 Sandhya became very powerful due to the powers
 shaktishaalee sandhya bhagwaan vishnu ke bhakton kaa sataane laga tha
 Asura had also taken over heaven, capturing the gods
 jab kisi bhi tarah devtaa sandhya ko jeet nahin paa rahe the, tab unhone ek yojana banaai
 According to the plan, all the gods and all the nine planets fell into a peacock's wings
 ab vah mor bahut shaktishaalee ho gaya tha
 The peacock took a huge form and killed Sandhya Asura
 tabhi se mor ko bhi poojaneey or pavitra mana jane laga
 Special importance of peacock feathers is also mentioned in astrology

 Before the first Test in Mohali starting on Thursday, Aaron said, 'I am very keen on the South Africa series
 maine srilanka main sirf ek test khelaa tha or yah kaaphi acha match nahin rahaa
 i managed to get just two wickets in that match

 Now it's time for me to improve
 ' The Jharkhand fast bowler has not been able to impress the selectors for the ODI matches so far, but is a part of the Test team from the last four series
 ek match ke pratibandh ke kaaran ishanth sharma mohali main pehle test main nahin khel paaenge or aise main aaron ko antim 11 main mauka mil saktaa he
 As such, Aaron has the backing of Kohli, who prefers his extra speed over bowlers bowling from the line and length
 aaron ne kaha, 'captain kaa samarthan milanaa hameshaa shandaar hota he
 But it's not just me, Virat has faith in every member of the team
 jab captain aapkaa samarthan karata he to hameshaa acha mahasoos hota he or ummid karata hum ki dakshin africa ke khilaaf unke bharose par khara utar paaunga
 ' hashim amala or abi divilliars jaise ballebaajon ko gendbaaji karnaa chunauti hogi, lekin aaron isaki jagah apni taiyaar par dhyaan laga rahe hai
 He said, 'to be honest, i am not working on any particular thing
 main kise gendbaaji kar rahaa hum is par dhyaan lagane kii jagah main basic sahi rakhane par dhyaan laga rahaa hum

 Interacted with many members of Modi's family through this technique
 modi ke chaar bhai (somabhai modi, amrit modi, pankaj modi, prahlaad modi) or hai or ek bahan (vaansati ben) bhi he 
 Amrit Modi and his son Sanjay Modi spoke with Aaj Tak with 3D holographic technology
 modi ke bade bhai amrit modi ne kaha ki dilli kii tarah ahmedabad kaa mausam bhi 'garam' he
 Modi's wishes have always been greater
 unhone gujarat main kaaphi kaam kiya he
 He was opinionated since childhood
 adiyal kabhi nahin rahe
 The child of a small society is becoming the PM of the country, it is no less a big deal
 ham modi se phone par haal chaal puch lete hai
 We do not have an understanding equal to their understanding, so the issues of the country are not discussed with them
 modi jo sochate hai wo karte hai
 Sanjay Modi's wife Kumud and daughter Nirali also talked with Aaj Tak through 3D holographic technology
 modi kii potee niraali ne kaha, 'mujhe khushi ho rahi he
 Good days will start when Dada becomes PM
 dada (narendra modi) family ko kam time dete hai
 "kumud said," Now the whole of Hindustan Modi's family is going to happen
 kam vakt dene ko lekar parivaar ko modi se kabhi koi shikaayat nahin rahi he
 Gujaratis felt that if Modi left from here, then the development here would stop

 Team Anna's core committee meeting created a ruckus
 baithak ke baad mufti shamin kazmi ne kor cameti se tyaagptr de diya
 On the other hand, on the issue of agitating with Ramdev, Team Anna appeared to be divided on two sides
 team anna sutron ke mutabik, ab ramdev ke saath 3 june se andolan nahin hoga
 In this way, the movement against corruption once again seems to be weakening
 team anna ne kaha ki mufti shamin kazmi baithak kii kaarywahi kii mobile phone se ‘audio ricarding’ karke use baahar bhej rahe the, jiske baad unhen nishkasit kar diya gaya
 Team Anna members discussed further strategies in Noida amid reports of disagreement over Ramdev's unilateral decision being taken despite Anna Hazare and Baba Ramdev's decision to support each other in agitations against corruption
 anna hajaare kii maujuudagi main hui baithak main arvind kejariwal, shanti bhushan, prashanth bhushan or kiran bedi bhi shaamil hue
 Team Anna has expressed unhappiness that Baba Ramdev held a press conference with Anna Hazare two days ago without his knowledge
 inhen khabaron kii prishthbhumi main baithak hui
 Sources say that some members of Team Anna are not in favor of running a joint movement with Ramdev
 in sadasyon kaa kahana he ki baba ke saamne saakh kaa sankat he, kyonki vah anek maamalon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 However, these members are not against supporting Ramdev's movements

 After the news of cooperation and differences between Anna Hazare and Ramdev for the past one year, Hazare announced last month that both Team Anna and Ramdev would support each other and join each other's campaign against corruption

 Although the report said that no one is seen shouting slogans of "india will remain a war till the ruin" in the video footage of the event on February 9, but it has been claimed that eyewitnesses in their testimony raised such slogans Confirmed to go
 report main kaarykram main ‘‘bharat ke tukade-tukade kar do’’ kaa vivaadaaspad naaraa lagaae jane kaa koi zikr nahin he
 The report prepared by a five-member panel headed by Rakesh Bhatnagar, a professor at the university, said that it was "unfortunate" that the students allowed outsiders to be present and shout provocative slogans
 report main kaha gaya he ki anumati radd kiye jane ke baavjood kaarykram yojit karnaa ‘‘jaanboojhkar avagya karne’’ ke baraabar he
 The panel also noted the lapses on the part of the university's security unit
 usne kaha ki usne baahar ke logon ko naare lagane se rokane or unhen parisar se jane se rokane kaa koi prayaas nahin kiye
 The committee said that although JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar had reached the premises late, he had objected to the officials' decision to revoke the permission
 kanhaiya ko kaarykram ke sambandh main deshadroh kaa aaropee banaaya gaya he
 Reportedly Omar Khalid, marked as one of the main organizers of the event, had told the officials that he would organize the event and that "the security unit can do whatever it wants
" ’’ report main kaha gaya he, ‘‘suraksha karmiyon ne bahari logon ke samooh kii maujuudagi dekhi thi or kai anya pratyakshdarshiyon ne is baat kii pushti kii he
 This group of outsiders most of the time covered their heads and faces with clothes (scarves)
 ’’ It says, "this group of people has" fought till the independence of Kashmir, will remain war "," Let India fight
 " 
 Loud slogans of 'ragda', 'go India Go Back' and 'pakistan Zindabad'
 ’’ report main kaha gaya he ki video main ek chaatr ko bhi narebaaji karte dekha gaya he
 The comments isamen kaha gaya he, ‘‘aayojakon ne kaarykram yojit nahin karne ke prashasan ke aadesh kii avhelnaa kii
 This is equivalent to deliberately disobeying
 yah atyant durbhagyapurna he ki aayojakon ne bahari logon ke samooh ko kaarykram main haaavee hone kii anumati di jinhone bhadakaau narebaaji karke maahaul garm kar diya
 "the report said," This act of outsiders has brought the entire JNU community into disrepute
 ’’(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 haalanki report main kaha gaya he ki 9 farvari ko hue kaarykram kii video footage main koi bhi ‘‘bharat kii barbaadi tak jang rahegi’’ ke naare lagaataa nahin dikh rahaa he lekin isamen daawa kiya gaya he ki pratyakshdarshiyon ne apni gavaahi main aise naare lagaae jane kii pushti kii he
 There is no mention of the controversial slogan of "cut India to pieces" in the program in the report

 The report said that holding the event despite the cancellation of permission amounts to "willful disobedience"
 panel ne vishvavidhyalay kii suraksha ikai kii ore se bhi hui chook kaa zikr kiya
 He said that he made no effort to stop outside people from shouting slogans and preventing them from leaving the premises
 samiti ne kaha ki haalanki jeenuasu adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar der se parisar main pahunche the lekin unhone anumati radd kiye jane ke adhikariyon ke nirnay par aapatti jataai thi
 Kanhaiya has been charged with treason in connection with the program

 com / mha3dqxqzf — anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) June 12, 2018 When we started searching for this artist who was praised by great people, we noticed that the language in which he is singing is not the language of India
 internet par thodi si khoj ke baad hi hamen ye shaks bhi mil gaya or ye bhi pataa chal gaya ki wo thailand kii thai bhashaa main ga rahaa he
 Her name is Saumpoung Uma and many of her videos are also available on the Internet
 uskaa khud kaa Youtube channel bhi he jise ek lakh log follow karte hai or use yahanehttps: / / www
 youtube
 com / user / mrsamapongxeka ja saktaa he
 When we tried to reach Saumpoong on the basis of the information available on social media, it was found that he lives in 'phat Nikhom' district in eastern Thailand
 kuch koshish ke baad ham un tak pahunchane main kaamyaab bhi ho gaye
 Soumpoung was very happy to know that his videos are being discussed in India
 lekin saumpong sirf thai bhashaa hi bol pate hai isliye unki ek dost ke jariye hamaari unase baat hui
 It turned out that Saumpong is a 26-year-old truck mechanic
 paanch saal pehle unhone shaukia taur par van main band shuru kiya tha jo dekhte hi dekhte khub lokapriy ho gaya
 Soumpong has sent this message to us specially from Thailand in English, for which he had to practice many times
 lekin saumpong ke bare main jaankaree jutate hue hamen pataa chalaa ki bharat main bhi aise honhaar kalakaar maujuud hai jo ek saath 12 se 15 instrument baja kar samaa baandh sakate hai
 One such artist is Gladson Peter, a resident of Byculla in Mumbai
 dekhie e aar rahamaan ke vande maataram par unka anokhaa andaaj
 Peter's story is also funny
 2012 main jab tibi kii chapet main aakar wo bistar par pade rahete the tab unhone aise kuch video dekhe
 His father is a pastor in the church and the music environment was already in his home
 unhone sochaa ki kyon na khud aisa karne kii koshish kii jaae
 He collected all the instruments for the One Man Music Band and also prepared the frame for it
 jiske jariye bajaate samay sabhi instrument main talmail banaaya jaataa he
 Shortly, Peter was recognized
 jab 'ajtak' ne peter se baat kii tab wo china main apana sho karne gaye hue the
 Peter said that there are about 35 one-man bands in the world, Saumpoung and his ilk
 lekin wo inamen sabase behatar banakar desh duniya main bharat kaa naam raushan karnaa chaahate hai

 com / 27kgkk5deu — Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) March 26, 2015pitch report Expecting the pitch to be slow, spinners may get help There are a total of 11 pitches at Sydney Cricket Ground, 1 of which has been retired
 semifinal match ke liye australian khilaadiyon ne pich par ghaas kii maang kii thi jisase uske tej gendbaajon ko acchhee swing or oochaal mil sake lekin isisi ne isse saaf inkaar kar diya
 In such a situation, the pitch on the Sydney Cricket Ground is likely to be slow, which can also help spin bowlers
 australian team main koi visheshgy spinner nahin he
 The toss at the Sydney Cricket Ground will also not be a big factor
 yahaan par pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team bhi jeet chuki he or chej karne vaali bhi
 In such a situation, Australia is also disappointed about the pitch
 Head to head records ke aadhaar par baari australian tiub tak hue 11 world cap toornament main kiye gaye pradarshan ke aadhaar par bhi in donon tiimon main se palada kangaaroon kaa hi baari he
 There have been 10 matches in the World Cup between these two teams and Team India won only 3 times
 itnaa hi nahin, team india ne ab tak kul 74 world cap maichon main se 46 jiti (62
 16 per cent)
 jabaki australia 82 world cap maichon main se 60 jeet (73
 17 per cent) tax is ahead
 ek or fact, bhale hi team india lagaataar 12veen jeet kii talash main utregi lekin lagaataar jeet kaa record bhi australia ke naam par hi he, wo bhi 25 match lagaataar jeetne kaa
 Team India has played a total of 14 odis against Australia on the SCG so far, but in the history of the last 35 years, the only win on this ground was seven years ago
 vaise isi maidan par anya tiimon khilaaf uskaa record 100 fisadi jeet kaa rahaa he
 She has defeated England, Pakistan and New Zealand in odis here
 australian team yahaan 125 vanade main 82 jeet ke aankade ke saath utregi
 For the last two years he has not lost a single ODI here
 is toornament main bhi use is maidan par ek match jeetne kaa anubhav he
 Maxwell had also scored a century in that match
 is toornament main yahaan chaar match khele gaye hai jisamen 48,000 darshakon kii kshamta vaale is stadium main cricket premi ab tak 29 chakke dekh chuke hai

 Although the minister Siddharth Nath Singh may have reprimanded his personal secretary for this, but his play in the letters has definitely taken a toll
 america ke nae raashtrapati donald trump ne mexico border par vishaal diwaar lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 It has also announced that the cost incurred on this will have to be paid to Mexico
 mexico ne iskaa virodh kiya he or vahaan ke raashtrapati ne apni america yatra bhi radd kar diya he
 The President of Mexico said that such a wall between two countries has no meaning
 gauratlab he ki mexico se logon kii aniyantrit awajahi or drugs vagairah kii taskari par roak ke liye lambey samay se maang ho rahi thi
 Trump promised during the elections to build a wall on the Mexico border
 trump ne elaan kiya he ki is diwaar kii laagat vasuulne ke liye padosi desh mexico se hone vaale aayaat par 20 fisadi tex vasula jayega
 Let's look at how practical this decision of Trump is and what hurdles can come in the way of it
 tanaav ke bich mexico ke raashtrapati ne taali yatramexico ke raashtrapati enrike paayna nito ne america kii apni purv nirdhaarit yatra america raashtrapati donald trump ke us twit ke baad radd kar di jisamen unhone kaha tha ki yadi mexico donon deshon kii seemaa par vishaldiver ke nirmaan ke liye paise dena nahin chaahtato unhen washington kii apni yatra radd kar deni chahie
 Payna Nieto said on Twitter that 'we have informed the White House that i will not attend a scheduled meeting with Trump in Washington next Tuesday
 ’ paayna nito ke faisle se kuch hi ghanton pehle trump ne twit kiya tha, ‘agar mexico is behad jaruri diwaar ke nirmaan ke liye paise nahin dena chahta to acha hoga ki aagaamee baithak radd kar di jaae
 'earlier also, Payna Nieto had condemned the US decision to build the wall on the border, reiterating that Mexico would not pay for the construction of the wall, while Trump was saying that he would ensure that Mexico paid for it
 kisapar padegaa tex kaa bojhamexico kii diwaar trump ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan ek bada vaada tha
 Now as soon as coming to power, Trump has ordered to implement it
 haalanki, iske liye mexico se hone vaale aayaat par 20 fisadi tex vasuulne kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Now it has to be seen who will ultimately spend it
 mexico se saamaan niryaat karne waalon par yaa america main use kharidne waalon par
 Because the final burden of any tax falls on the buyer
 yahaan trump ko america main virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa pad saktaa he
 The proposal in the US Parliament said that 20 percent import tax should be imposed on countries exporting more than imports in the US
 isse america companiyon ke liye apana saamaan bechney ke maukey badhenge
 Trump has been continuously giving the slogan of America First
 iske tahat trump prashasan america aane vaale saamaan par tex laga saktaa he vahiin america companiyon ko niryaat main chhot mil sakati he
 What will be the effect on Mexico? Even if the Trump administration has announced that the cost of the wall will be taxed on imports from Mexico, but ultimately the burden may fall on American consumers
 mexico kii company se ise bhale hi sarkaar vasuul le lekin aakhirkaar company america upabhoktaaon par iskaa boj daalegi
 The second question also arises whether the entire cost of the wall can be recovered by taxing imports from Mexico
 anumaan ke mutabik is vishaal diwaar kii pariyojna par 15 billian dollar tak kaa kharch aa saktaa he
 It may take time to levy a tax on trade from Mexico
 america vyapaar main mexico kii sthitiamerica kaa padosi desh mexico vahaan saamaan aayaat karne ke maamle main doosraa sabase bada desh he
 China is in first place
 america-mexico ke bich vyapaar main ai koi bhi baadha baaki deshon ko bhi prabhavit karegi
 American exporters may appear to be in favor of the tax exemption at the moment, but experts say that this will ultimately reduce jobs for the American people
 kitna legal he ye faisla?padosi desh par tex kaa boj badhaane ke america ke faisle ko uttar america mukt vyapaar samjhauta-nafta or vishwa vyapaar sanghathan-wto main virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 These organizations have been consistently raising their voice in favor of free trade and against protectionist policies
 mexico khud ko bachaane ke liye in manchon par apni aawaaj jarur buland karegaa
 If it affects the import of products and services from other countries, then the protest will intensify
 ye raste bhi apana sakate hai trump-mexico se aane vaale saamaan par aayaat ke alaava america main kaam karne vaale mexico ke logon par tex boj badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the election campaign, Trump has been continuously emphasizing this
 -america patriot tex main badlaav ke jariye mexico bheje jane vaale paise par tex badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Mexican people living and working in the United States send about $ 25 billion every year
 isapar tex badhaakar vasuuli kii ja sakati he
 -trump has been saying that if Mexico agrees to give 5 to 10 billion dollars to America then it can be exempted

 You will be surprised to know that despite the scandal of 45 thousand crore rupees, Pearl Group is still collecting money in the name of different attractive schemes from gullible investors
 45 hajaar karod rupee rajya kya, kai mulkon kaa bhi salanaa bajet itnaa nahin hoga
