 wo bhi adaalat se
 Your honor i also want to say something
 main is cese kii sabase jaruri gavaah hum
 Whose lawsuit you are deciding
 agar wo kaatil hai to main makatool hum
 If they are bloodthirsty i am known
 agar wo pathar hai to main wo dil hum jise kuchlaa gaya he
 Your Honor, how can it be that your testimony does not include my intention to give you justice
 yor honor aap jis taraazoo par julm ko insaaf se taulate hai uskaa ek palada main hum
 But your honor is not being heard for me only and only because i have turned into ashes for myself
 chaliye yor honor aapkaa kanoon kisi murda ke bayaan ko nahin maanata to na sahi
 At least i can talk to you
 yor honor mere saath 16 disambar kii raat jin logon ne havas kaa jaanaleva hamalaa kiya tha
 One of them committed suicide
 usne aapke faisle kaa bhi intjaar nahin kiya
 Made his own decision, decided his own sentence
 yor honor wo jisane mere saath sabase zyada berahami dikhaai
 Your law and our society considers him a child
 lekin bachche tak ke andar jo vahashipan samaa gaya, uskaa jimmedaar koun he? iske bare main aap or ye samaaj donon khamosh ho jate hai
 Your Honor, if you want to judge me, my death, my cruelty, in reality, then force the society, the law, the protectors of the law to create a world that girls like me
 meri bahanon ko, meri maaon ko, lage ki wo mahfuj hai
 When lust comes in someone's eyes, before that his heart trembles with the fear of the consequences
 agar aapane ye nahin kiya to kisi ko baccha kahkar chhod dena
 To hang someone or give life imprisonment will not work
 kuch nahin hoga jaj sahab
 And i know that you know this reality better than me
 yor honor aap faisla sunaane ja rahe hai isliye main chaahati hum ki us raat jo qayaamat mujh par tuuti thi wo kahani aap ek baar phir sun len
 My friend was with me that night
 us darindagi kaa sabase bada gavaah
 i am not, so my friend will tell you the story of that night
 plis sun lijie yor honor
 He has said what he had to say to the court
 ab adaalat ke baahar us raat kii kahani wo apane dost se sunaanaa chaahati he
 She wishes that whatever was spent on that night of doom, she should once again hear the court
 taaki faisla karne main aasaani ho
 It was Sunday
 main apni dost ke saath saket mal main evening sho film ‘life of pai’ dekhakar laut rahaa tha
 We were to go from Saket to Palam Mor
 par koi autowala chalane ko taiyaar hi nahin tha
 With great difficulty, he agreed to run an autowall without a meter
 vahaan se ham auto main muniraka bas stand pahunche
 We were both standing at the bus stop waiting for the bus
 magar kaaphi der tak koi bas nahin ai
 Meanwhile, a white colored charted bus stopped at the bus stop
 us bas main savaar ek ladke ne hi hamen aawaaj di thi
 On our asking, he told that the bus is going towards Palam village
 lihaaja ham donon bas main savaar ho gaye
 When we boarded the bus, three people were sitting on the ride seat inside
 hamen baad main pataa chalaa ki wo teenon sawari nahi balki usee bas ke jaanane vaale hai
 As soon as i boarded the bus, i asked him for a ticket twice
 iske baad unhone hamase bees rupee liye
 Shortly after walking, all three boys sitting on a sudden ride started looking at us and started speaking in reverse
 phir jab wo kaaphi budtamiji karne lage, to mujhe gussa aa gaya or maine un teenon kii pitayee kar di
 The fight was done deliberately to provoke me
 kyonki jhagada hote hi do or log jo pehle se hi bas main savaar the achaanak saamne aa gaye or lohe kii rod se mujhapar hamalaa kar diya
 The rod was on the head so i began to faint
 iske baad bas maine yahi dekha ki wo meri dost ko khinchate hue bas kii pichhali seat kii taraf le ja rahe the
 During this time both me and my friends were constantly screaming for help
 lekin koi madad ko nahin aayaa
 Even my friend interrupted herself to save me
 usne unase muqabla kiya
 He even tried to call the police on the number 100 from his mobile
 lekin badmaashon ne usase mobile chin liya
 We were completely trapped now
 un logon ne ab bas kii lite bhi band kar di thi
 Meanwhile, the more times my friend tried to protect herself, the more the miscreants attacked her
 use buree tarah se maaraa-peeta
 But during this time there was no help in the whole path even once
 aakhir do ghante baad jab badmaashon kii havas puri ho gai to shaayad unhen pehali baar laga ki meri dost ab mar chuki he, main sun rahaa tha
 They were talking among themselves that the girl seems to have died
 isliye ise bhi yani mujhe bhi maar daalo
 After this, suddenly the rod started attacking me again
 meri dost ab puri tarah behosh or lahuluhaan padi thi
 And i too was lying quietly on the floor of the bus
 taaki unhen ye naa lage ki mujhamen ab bhi jaan baaki he
 After this, they took my purse, bag, mobile and everything from my friend
 phir aakhir main unhone ham donon ke saare kapade bhi utaar liye
 After this, at around eleven o'clock in the night, they threw both of us down with a moving bus near Mahipalpur flyover
 neeche phenkakar wo hamen usee bas se kuchal dena chaahate the
 But somehow i pulled my friend away from the wheel of the moving bus
 iske baad wo bas ko daudaate hue andher main gum ho gaye
 Now both of us were completely lying on the roadside
 khun ab bhi bah rahaa tha
 There was not a single cloth on the body, there was also a lot of chin
 main kisi tarah himmat kar haath uthaa-uthaakar logon se madad kii bheekh maang rahaa tha ki koi ham donon ko aspataal pahunchaa de
 Someone give us clothes
 par kisi ne hamaari madad nahin kii
 During this period, many autowalls, car owners passed by, many of them also looked at us, reducing the speed, but none stopped
 shaashad log isliye hamaari madad nahin kar rahe the ki kahin police cese yaa gavaahi ke chakkar main naa funs jaaen
 Later many pedestrians also witnessed our condition
 wo hamaare paas bhi aae, khadey bhi hue, par sirf tamashbin kii tarah
 Without any help, we both stayed in this way for about 20-25 minutes
 vakt gujarata ja rahaa tha, khun behisaab bah rahaa tha
 My friend was completely unconscious
 par mujhe ab bhi andaja nahin tha ki use kaise-kaise or kya-kya jakhm mili hai? kaaphi vakt ham yunhi sadak kinare pade rahe
 Then somewhere a man saw us and he called the police
 thodi der baad hi maine dekha ki ek saath teen-teen pisiar vine hamaare paas pahunch gai thiah lekin hamaari madad karne kii bajaae wo aapas main pehle ye tay kar rahe the ki hamaara maamla kis thane main aayega? main tab bhi lagaataar cheekh rahaa tha, chilla rahaa tha
 i was beseeching him to give us clothes, call an ambulance, and go to the hospital
 par thane kii seemaa ke chakkar main kareeb aadhe ghante unhone yunhi jaaya kar diya
 Half an hour later, they went and brought a sheet with which i covered my friend
 uski haalat lagaataar kharaab ho rahi thi, phir maine kisi tarah use uthaakar pisiar vine kii seat par litayaa or uske baraabar main khud baith gaya
 There was also a hospital nearby
 maine pulisavaale se kaha bhi ki meri dost kii haalat bighad rahi he, aap yaheen le chalo
 But the police took us to Safdarjung Hospital not far from there
 vahaan pahunchane main hamaara kaaphi vakt barbaad ho gaya
 Even after reaching the hospital, no one helped us
 bahut der tak main logon se ek adad kapadaa maangata rahaa
 But no one gave even a cloth
 maine kaha thand lag rahi he, kambal nahin to daravaaje, khidki par padaa pardaa hi de do
 Asked for help from even the scavenger
 par kisi ne madad nahin kii
 Then somehow i asked a man for his mobile and called him home
 maine gharavaalon ko yahi bataaya ki hamaara accident ho gaya he
 Actually, i could not understand what i should say to them
 Could not tell about returning after watching the film with friend
 aspataal pahunchane ke baad pehali baar mujhe pataa chalaa ki meri dost ke saath kya hua he
 They treated him worse than animals
 wo bolne tak kii haalat main nahin thi
 Then i wrote to him and asked him what was happening to him
 He replied that he is suffering from treatment expenses
 bahut paise kharch ho jaaenge
 Yes, he also wrote that those miscreants should not be hanged but burnt alive
 safadarajang main main apni dost se lagaataar miltaa rahaa
 He also told him how the whole country is fighting for him
 wo un gunahagaaron ke bare main bhi mujhase puuchhati thi ki unka kya hua? maine use bataaya ki sabhi pakade gaye
 Yes, he was worried about the cost of treatment
 hameshaa puuchhati rahati thi ki kitna kharch ho jayega? main usase yahi kahata tha ki kharch kii phikr mat karo
 Just you get well
 haalanki khud mere haath-pair jakhmi the
 The leg bone was broken
 lekin 16 disambar kii us raat se hi agle teen-chaar dinon tak police ne mujhe thane main hi rakhaa
 To tell the truth, the day the SDM was taking the statement of my friend, that day, for the first time, i came to know the full truth about the atrocities on my friend
 itani krurta to jaanavar bhi nahin kar saktaa
 He also kills the victim by strangulation
 magar yahaan to jo hua uske bare main kah bhi nahin saktaa

 kashmir ko lekar britain main hinsak jhadap ke baad videsh mantri dominic raab bole, kisi bhi samudaay
 
 
 Reacting indirectly to the criticism being made by a section of the British media over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's past, he said on Friday that headlines of newspapers and TV cannot be considered as a yardstick to evaluate a country
 modi ne yahaan bhartiya samudaay ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bharat keval vah nahin he jitna akhabaaron main dikhataa he
 India is much bigger than that

 Addressing the Indian community here, Modi said that India is not just what it appears in newspapers
 bharat usase kahin bada he

 In view of the opposition to the increase in the fares of the metro for the second time within a year, the central government is planning to reduce it
 ab modi sarkaar metro kiraye ko kam karne ko lekar vichaar kar rahi he
 According to sources, the Urban Development Ministry is considering a cut in the metro fares of 5-12 km and 12-21 km slabs
 agar sutron kii maane to donon slab ke kiraye main 5-5 rupee kii katautee ho sakati he
 The fare of 5-12 km has been increased from Rs 20 to Rs 30, while the slab of 12 - 21 km has been increased from Rs 30 to Rs 40
 sutron ke mutabik shahari vikaas mantralay donon slab main is sambandh main price fixation committee ko faisle par punarvichaar ke liye jald kah sakati he
 Apart from this, the Ministry of Urban Development can also introduce a new scheme for fares for senior citizens and children in Delhi Metro train

 Sisodia said that the metro fare has been increased only to benefit private taxi companies
 metro kiraaya badhane par log privet texiyon kaa istemaal karenge
 Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia also alleged that the central government has been sold to private companies
 sisodiya ne bataaya ki dilli metro hi nahin balki duniya bhar ke metro munaafe main rahete hai, kyonki isamen bhrasht netaaon ko rishwat nahin dena hota he
 Sisodia has expressed a fear of a scam in this entire case

 Indian carrier Air India is going to start non stop flights from New Delhi to San Francisco on 2 December
 san francisco international airport ne is flite kii ghoshnaa soshal media par ek contest ke madhyam se kii he
 a competition titled 'non-stop Air India' has been organized on social media to mark the launch of the first flight from New Delhi to the popular technology city
 is pratisparddha main air india or uski san francisco international airport kii seva ke bare main paanch sawaal puche gaye hai
 SFO Public Relations Director Charles Shuller said, "this new service is important and it will be the first direct flight from the US west coast to India, saving a lot of travel time"
 esefo kii vijyapti main kaha gaya he ki is pratisparddha ke jariye pratibhaagiyon ko air india ke vimaan kii nai dilli tak vaapasi kii udaan kaa iconomi tiktaasil karne kaa mauka milegaa
 input language dilli main emsidi chunaav najadik he to vahi duusari taraf bijepi ke andar khemebaaji bhi khul kar saamne aa rahi he, bijepi ke andar isko lekar khusur-fusar bhi shuru ho chuki he
 Darsal is BJP President Manoj Tiwari, but this time it is happening, which has not happened in BJP till date
 sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyonki dilli bijepi ke prabharee shyaam jaju emsidi chunaav ke maddenjar tikat lene waalon se khud hi milane lage hai or wo bhi party offis main, jabaki bina adhyaksh ke prabharee party offis main nahin mil sakate he
 This is the first time that Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju is sitting in the party office and he is meeting ticket takers between 2 to 6 every day, while according to sources, he cannot do this without the chairman in charge
 vahiin emsidi chunaav ke maddenjar kor team bhi bana di gai he jisame adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke alaava prabharee shyaam jaju or mahasachiv ravindra gupta, rajesh bhaatia or kulajit chahal shaamil hai
 But none of these are considered to belong to the Manoj Tiwari camp
 is par ajtak se baat karte hue shyaam jaju ne iskaa khandan kiya or kaha ki party main faisla sarvasammati se liya jayega, jabaki bijepi main pehle adhyaksh hi faisla letaa he or mahasachiv isko lagu karte hai
 This time the case is quite different, about which there is a buzz
 vahiin duusari taraf dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari chunaav prachaar ke liye dilli se baahar he or sutron ke mutabik unako isaki soochna bhi de di gai he
 Now waiting for Manoj Tiwari to come to Delhi
 haalanki aisa nahin ki ye koi pehali baar he ki prabharee or adhyaksh ke bich khinchataan dikhaai de rahi ho
 Even before this, the president was excluded in choosing the team of Delhi BJP and then Manoj Tiwari also expressed a lot of resentment over it
 jiske baad unke logon ko bhi jagah di gai, lekin ek baar phir emsidi chunaav ke maddenjar prabharee or adhyaksh ke bich khinchataan dikhaai dene lagi he

 There was a lot of criticism a month ago over the disputed order of dress code for women teachers in Punjab government schools
 rajya sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag ko dress code ke notification ko waapas lenaa padaa tha
 Not only this, two officers who issued notifications were also suspended
 abhi wo vivaad thik se thama bhi nahin tha ki shiksha vibhaag ne teachers kii parformens ko lekar vaarshik gopneey report (ACR) kaa jo nayaa formet pesh kiya he, usase mahila teachers main kaaphi naaraazgi he
 In this format, the 'dress' of a teacher will also be considered to assess its performance
 maamle ke tool pakadaney par punjab kii shiksha mantri aruna choudhary ne formet se pahanaave kaa kollam hataane ke aadesh die hai
 a new column named 'clothing' has been added to the ACR for 2016-17
 iske tahat skool main 'uchit dhang se poshaak' pahan kar aane vaale teachers ko number die jaaenge
 Under this, the nodal officer or principal will be asked what kind of clothes the teacher came to school during the respective year
 ACR report main teachers ke kapadon ko lekar do kollam banaae gaye hai
 It is written in one column - 'ok' and in the second column it is written as 'inflammatory'
 haalanki ye saaf nahin kiya gaya he ki kis tarah ke kapadon ko 'bhadakaau' yaa 'aapattijanak' mana jayega
 Would a salwar suit or a sari be considered 'fine' and jeans-tops or other western clothes 'inflammatory'? It is being said that 0 out of a total of 5 numbers when judging the teacher's performance
 5 number pahanaave ke honge
 Apart from this, the performance of the teacher will also be assessed on many other aspects such as how the school got the result in the board examinations
 ACR main saaf likhaa gaya he ki parformens aankate vakt teachers ke kapadon ko bhi aadhaar banaaya jaae or sade kapade pahan kar aane par zyada marks die jaaen
 The education department has started preparing ACR report of teachers and other non-teaching staff
 31 agast tak ye report jilon ke nodel officer taiyaar karke shiksha vibhaag ko saunpny hogi
 Apart from attire, the issues on which teachers' performance will be assessed are -1
 teacher kii class kaa rigelt kitne pratishat rahaa
 2
 wo vishay jo skool teacher padhaati he usamen kitne pratishat chaatr paas hue
 3
 kya teacher ne chaatro ko padhaate hue blikeboard kaa istemaal kiya yaa nahin
 4
 kyabacchon ko padhaate huetichar kursi par baithi rahati thi yaa class main chaaron ore ghumkar chaatro par najar rakhte hue unhen padhaati thi
 5
 kya teacher ne un aadhunik takneekon kaa istemaal kiya joki shiksha vibhaag kii taraf se training ke dauraan teachers ko bataai gai thi
 6
 skool ke anya teachers or principal ke saath teacher kaa vyavhaar kis tarah kaa rahaa
 All these things are valid about the performance of the teacher, but the teachers are most angry about the dress column
 sarkari skulon main teachers ne naam nahin kholane kii shart par kaha ki bhale hi punjab ke shiksha vibhaag ne un par lagu kiye gaye dress court ke faisle ko waapas le liya ho lekin apratyaksh taur par ab formet ke madhyam se dress code thopa ja rahaa he
 They say that when they came to know about the feedback being taken about the clothes in the performance, they were shocked
 aakhirkaar sarkaar kaise ek mahila teacher ko bataa sakati he ki wo kis tarah ke kapade pahanakar skool main aae? in teachers kaa kahana he ki unki parformens kaa akalan unke rigelt or vishay ke gyaan par hona chahie naa ki unke kapadon par
 The format associated with the dress has been condemned by Aam Aadmi Party mlas Baljinder Kaur and Rupinder Ruby
 akali dal ke netaaon main purv shiksha mantri dalajit singh cheema or parminder singh dhindsa ne bhi congress sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 On learning about the matter, Punjab Education Minister Aruna Chaudhary tried to defeat the previous akali-bjp government
 aruna choudhary ne kaha ki jo parformens ATR form bheje gaye hai wo 2012 ke puraane form he or ye farm akali dal kii sarkaar ke vakt taiyaar kiye gaye the
 According to Aruna Chaudhary, her government has no intention of telling the teachers what kind of clothes they should wear
 aruna choudhary ne kaha ki teachers ke parformens kaa akalan unki yogyata ke aadhaar par hi hoga
 Aruna Chaudhary said that as soon as she got information, she has ordered to remove the dress column from these old farms
 bataa den ki jab dress code lagu karne kaa notification jari hua tha tab bhicongress sarkaar kior se ise akali-bijepi sarkaar ke vakt kaa notification bataa kar pallaa jhaadne kii koshish kii gai thi
 The notification to implement the dress code was called a notification of the time of the previous akali-bjp government
 is baar bhi punjab kii shiksha mantri is ATR parformens form ko 2012 kaa purana form bataa rahi hai
 But the question is, why were they not properly examined before sending the old form? Why was it not noticed that sending them could cause a ruckus due to the teachers' displeasure? aise samay main jab puri duniya main vaishvik taapmaana bad rahaa he, glacier teji se pigal rahe hai

 Maha Shivratri 2019: 4 march 2019 ko mahashivaratri kaa parv manaaya jayega
 It is believed that Lord Shankar was descended from Brahma as Rudra at midnight on the same day in the beginning of creation
 kehete hai ki mahashivaratri main kisi bhi prahar agar bhole baba kii aradhana kii jaae to bhole tripurari dil kholkar apane bhakton kii manokamanaayen puri karte hai
 Mahashivaratri is the biggest festival of worship of Lord Shiva
 phalgun krishna chaturdashi ko mahashivaratri parv manaaya jaataa he
 It is better to prepare before the festival
 mahashivaratri se pehle aise karen taiyaariyaan-- nahaakar halke safed yaa halke gulabi rang ke kapade pahanen
 - Give water to Lord Suryanarayana with copper lotus and do 3 pradakshina by standing there
 - ab apane ghar ke mandir main saaf safai aarambh kar den or ho sake to apane ghar ke mandir ko uttar purv ke kone main ishan kone main sthapit karen
 - Keep all the items of the temple in an orderly manner
 - mandir main prayog hone vaale diya, plate, ghantii, shankh aadi ko pehle hi saaf karke rakhen
 - Keep all the materials used in the worship of Mahashivaratri beforehand
 - mahashivaratri se ek din purv is tareeke se taiyaari karne se aapako agle din kii puja main kisi tareeke kaa vyavdhaan nahin hoga or puja paath ke kaary main man laga rahegaa
 Materials to be offered to Lord Shiva - One day before Mahashivaratri, buy all the materials to be offered to Lord Shiva
 jaise roli, moli, sabut chaaval, dhoop deep, mishri, kamalgatta, sabut haldi, paanch prakaar ke fal, safed mishthan, safed chandan, nagkesar, kesar, mishri, belptr, aak datura, bhaang, laal or pile gulab ke phool, aak ke phool, rang birange abir gulaal, gulab or chandan kaa itr
 Purchase all these materials a day in advance and keep them in your place of worship
 patrika main navagrahon kii pidaa he to nimna prakaar kaa abir bhagwaan bholenath ko arpan karen
 - Red colored abir for the suffering of Sun, Mars
 - chandramaa or shukr kii pidaa ke liye gulabi yaa safed rang kaa abir
 - Orange for Jupiter and green abir for Mercury
 - shani rahu ketu kii shanti ke liye aasamaani yaa nile rang kaa abir bhagwaan shiv ko arpan karne ke liye pehle se hi kharid kar rakhen
 Make arrangements for food offerings before Mahashivaratri - it is prohibited to eat offerings made to Lord Shankar
 aisi manyata he ki jo is prasad ko khaataa he, wo narak ke dukhon kaa bhoga karata he
 For the relief of this suffering, it is necessary to have a statue of Shaligram or a statue of Lord Vishnu near the idol of Shiva
 yadi shiv kii murti ke paas shaaligram ho, to prasad khaane kaa koi dosha nahin he
 - Use rock salt in place of normal salt in fasting dishes
 - laal mirch kii jagah kaali mirch kaa hi prayog karen
 You can make Singhara or Kuttu flour pakoras
 - saboodana kaa prayog bhi acha hoga, kyonki isamen carbohydrate kii pramukhataa hoti he or isamen kuch maatra main calcium va vitamin-si bhi hota he
 How to please Lord Bholenath- To please Lord Bholenath, wake up early in the morning on the day of Mahashivaratri and take a bath
 - ek chaandi yaa steel kaa lotaa len, jal main kaccha doodh mishri milakar apane daaen haath se bhagwaan shivlinga par namah shivaay mantra kaa jaap karte hue arpan karen
 While sitting on a pedestal, read Shivashtak 3 times
 - apane man kii ichha bhagwaan bholenath ko kahen
 While returning home, donate some fruits, clothes etc
 to the needy people who are found on the way
 - sandhya kaal ke samay ek shuddh rudraksh kii maala safed pile phulon ke saath bhagwaan shiv ko arpan karen
 Doing this will increase your health

 It was believed that Bhagwat made this remark during a coordination meeting held behind closed doors of the Sangh and its associated organizations
 samanvay baithak ke baad sangh ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha tha ki mohan bhagwatji ne spasht kaha ki ek bhi hindu ko desh nahin chhodana hoga
 He had said that Hindus who came to India after suffering persecution and suffering in other nations will remain here

 kuch logon kaa hota he ki wo bas kaam ko shuru karte hai or wo apane aap anjaam tak pahunch jaataa he
 As if there is some magic
 aisa hi kehete hai piyush mishra apane bare main 'maine pehali baar hormonium chuaa or wo baj gaya
 'and since then their harmonium has been ringing
 kabhi duniya ko thukraata he to kabhi dur des ke tower main aroplen ghusavaata he
 Piyush Mishra is among the group of people who can drag someone into the depths of their words and drown them
 or phir jo aadmi ubhar kar nikalataa he wo koi or hi hua phirata he
 Actually Piyush Mishra will be seen on the stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on 12 November
 12-13 november ko dilli main ho rahaa he sahitya aaj tak
 There was a phone conversation with Piyush Mishra about his journey since his childhood
 baatcheet ke ansh neeche padhein:-sawaal-aapkaa sahitya se pehla muqabla kab hua?piyush-bachapan se meraa sahitya kaa saath rahaa
 Was very fond of reading Hindi literature since childhood
 mere pita ji kii badaulat
 From childhood, Nandan used to read pollen and all such books
 jaise chanda mamaa
 These books introduced me to literature
 inhen kitabon se main sahitya se judaa
 Then i do not know when i wrote the first Poetry
 us vaqt main aathvin class main tha
 If i study today, i think it was well written
 wo poetry yaad he?zindaa ho haa tum koi shaq nahinsaans lete hue dekha maine bhi haihath or pairon or jism ko harakatenkhub dete hue dekha maine bhi he
 Now, even though doing this, you take a hard lip with pain, now it is so little for you, do you live well in your understanding
 ise maine apane saathiyon ko padhaayaa
 He was older than me
 unki apni samaj thi
 He said yes it is good it is good
 lekin aaj kii taarikh main itani manyata milti he is poem ko to ab mujhe lagata he ki vaaki acha likhaa tha
 The question - the way literature is evolving, how much literature do you get in films right now? Piyush - is not running anywhere
 sahitya kahin nahin he
 Question - has everything disappeared from the movies? Piyush - All is missing, Urdu poetry was alive in the earlier films
 ye tamaam behatar se behatar kitabon par filmein banty thim
 What a wonderful film, Sir Sahib made
 behtareen script sahitya ke zariye ai thim
 Bandini, etc
 were all these
 is vaqt to bilkul hi gaayab ho gaya he
 Nowadays there is no cinema inspired by literature
 ye jo byopix aaj kal ban rahi hai, inhen thodi na tum sahitya se judi filmein kahoge
 Cinema is a very big literature in itself
 cinema kos sahitya se mat jodo
 There is a lot of literature in cinema itself
 raju hiraani kii sari filmein jo hai wo masterpises hai
 Vishal Bhai's three films Maqbool, Haider and Omkara have glimpses of literature
 hindi sahitya se prerit filmein nahin hai
 But what is being written there is literature in itself
 ye cinema sahitya he
 All the pictures of Raju Hirani Lage Raho Munnabhai, Munnabhai MBBS and Three Idiots are all masterpieces of cinema
 ye scripts agar logon ko padhai jaayengi to phir kitna bhala ho jayega duniya kaa
 This is a literature in itself
 khosla kaa ghosla apane aap main ek sahitya he
 Black Friday is a slot in itself
 gangs of vasepur apane aap main ek sahitya he
 So this cinema has its own fun
 cinema ko story se or maahaul se jodakar nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Because that story crosses a lot of ranks as it is transformed into cinema
 teesri kasam kii baat lo
 a story of one and a half pages is killed in Gulfam
 wo pikchar main kitni badhiya tarah se transform hui he
 Question- You have always been writing
 magar aapke liye ab chizein badal gai hai
 What is the difference between your reading and writing after this change? Piyush - Now i read a lot less than before
 aaj kal to padhai bahut kam ho gayi he
 i am sorry for this mai likh letaa hum
 But ever since i have been balanced, there has been a slight decrease in everything
 jab main bilkul hi pagal tha tab bahut karata tha
 Whereas it should have been the opposite
 jab aap santulit hote hai to zyaada chizein kerani chahie
 But we artists have the misfortune that life was unbalanced, when life was not taking care, at that time i wrote a lot, what was acting
 bahut zyaada kiya
 Nowadays it is a little less because of balance
 jisko main galat maanata hum
 Nowadays, which means, by writing, better things have come from art
 aaj kal kisi alcoholic kii madad kar detaa hum
 If an alcoholic improves because of me, then i consider it a greater achievement than all my art
 aaj kal pryority badal gayi hai
 Question - The one thing that inspires the most in literature? Piyush - it cannot happen
 main kisi ek chiz se inspire nahin ho saktaa
 That can not be
 balki main to ye kahata hum ki basikali koi kasi se inspired nahin hota
 These are all nonsense things
 ki main isse inspired hum usase inspired hum
 Inspiration comes from inside you
 jab aapako lagata he ki kriyet karnaa, likhnaa acting karnaa aapaki zarurat he, aap uske bina rah nahin sakate varanaa aapaki saans ghut jaaegi
 Then you spit out yourself
 ye inspireshan vagairah sab bakawaas he
 i like everything
 sab achche the
 From Premchand to Tagore to Shakespeare, everyone is your modern poet
 ikbaal sahab ne bahut inspire kiya
 Sahir Sahib used to write very well
 majaruuh sahab ne to bahut inspire kiya
 But i cannot say that my poetry was made by taking inspiration from them
 bob dilan ko maine tab suna tha jab main bahut sara likh chukaa tha
 i did not understand English songs
 to maine usko tab suna jab main bahut likh chukaa tha olerady
 When i saw him, people told him that you are very inspired by him
 matlab aapkaa content kaaphi miltaa he
 But i told you why i don't take Dillon's name
 maine bahut let padhaa maine use
 i heard him
 ye ittefaq tha ki do maansiktaayen mil gayi thim
 By coincidence, i too started singing and writing on the same lines
 ek shaayad ye the ki wo bhi likhte the, main bhi likhata tha
 He used to compose, i used to do it too
 wo bhi gaate the, main bhi gaata tha
 So maybe it was too
 shaayad ye mil gayi ho
 Otherwise i have never been inspired by anyone

 When they raised us carefully, protecting us from the shadow of our past, they prepared us in such a way that we were asked to forget our past and cherish things that they had no authority over
 aisi duniya main, jahaan prem or hinsa ke aakhyaanon par savarnon kaa hi varchasv he, avarnon kii ichchhaaon ko to prakat hone se pehle hi mitaa diya jaataa he
 The Dalit adults of my generation have a tangle of bitter feelings towards their parents, as it has both anger and sympathy; We have to face them first as Dalits and then as parents
 2009 main, maine dakshinpanthi naitik paharuon kii jyadatiyon ke khilaaf shuru hue 'gulabi chaddi' abhiyaan main ek maamuli yogadan diya
 Later the same year, i was shocked to learn that my father donated ten thousand rupees to Pramod Mutalik and his Sri Ram Sene 'to protect Indian culture'
 main behad naaraaz or baichaiyn thi, isliye maine ek or undervier bheja or phir haar maan lee
 Some time ago, an Ambedkarite publisher asked me why my father was so right-wing and anti-dalit

 What else do they expect from a Dalit in the world of Savarnas? Although the decade of 2010 was a decade of moral watchdogs and protests against the love jihad and both of them, this decade has witnessed other important moments like abolishing Section 377
 , We are gradually accepting the fact that Dalit families, whether urban or non-urban, have the same status, do not have the same rights as real people
 Im news is
 ham yaa to bahut aage hai or khabaren mushkil se hamaari gati ko pakadati hai yaa itnaa peeche ki kabhi-kabhi aisa mahasoos hota he ki ham abhi bhi '90 ke dashak main hai
 We do not spend our lives in real time, whereas our existence exists today
 agar koi vaastavik samay main na ji rahaa ho to, is desh main aaj jo kuch ho rahaa he, usko dekhte hue acchhee dharna bananaa aasaan nahin he
 In a bizarre change, Twitter seems to have become a hangout where the younger generation of Dalits experience the real-time feeling
 kai dalit mahilaon ke liye, is tarah ke real time ke samudaay main hone kaa yah pehla anubhav he
 Asha Kovatal, general secretary and activist of the All India Dalit Mahila Manch, says that community love is more valuable to them than the love between two people
 haalanki, vaikalpik soshal media network smaleboard kii salaahkaar christina dhanraj kaa maananaa he ki samudaay hameshaa isaki guarantee nahin detaa he
 She says, "lack of love is at the heart of our oppression
" dalit mahilaon, or vishesh rup se jo paramparaagat rup se sundar yaa savarnon jaisi nahin hai, unhen pyaar paane ke liye mashkkat kerani hogi
 That is, they have to give a lot repeatedly and in different ways to get something in return
 iske baavjood samudaay main or rishton main aapako tuchh samajha ja saktaa he
 "the other thing that this decade has given is a particular kind of feminism which is finding itself inconvenient to include Dalit women
" mulat: yah apane se itar logon kii pyaar, hinsa yaa yahaan tak ki ichchhaaon ko samajhane main savarna vyavasthaaon kii vifaltaa kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 They are in a hurry to censor and dismiss old versions of their own, seeing new versions rapidly evolving
 2017 main ai hit telegu film arjuna reddy kii mook heroin priti kii kahani kuch jaani-pahachaani thi, jise jhuthalaanaa mujhe mushkil laga
 His inability to say 'yes', 'no', 'don't', 'get lost' made me nervous
 isane 10 saal pehle kii yaaden taaja kar deen jab maine isse badtar sthiti dekhi thi
 In 2007, there was love like the violent, abusive Arjun Reddy that i knew and wanted to know more
 isliye nahin ki ghar main hinsa kaa maahaul dekha tha yaa phir isliye bhi nahin ki mujh par bollywood yaa tollywood kaa zyada hi khumaar chadha tha balki isliye ki yah mere chaaron ore ho rahaa tha, meri doston ke saath yaa phir meri bahanon ke saath
 Needless to say that i also wanted to be a similar girl
 ye zyaadaatar sidhe-baalo vaali ucch jati kii ladkiyaan thim, jinka lajjapurna vyavhaar mujhe bada lubhaata tha or maine uski nakal kii asafal koshish bhi kii
 She was very beautiful but there was no enthusiasm in her life either
 hamaari tarah ve bhi pareshaan thim
 Yes, the troubles varied
 lekin yah tathy ki ve ladakon or ladakiyon ke bich samaan rup se lokapriy thim or isse main yah maanane lagi thi ki prem kahaniyaan (koi fark nahin padataa ki kis tarah kii) keval un jaisi ladakiyon ke liye banaai gai thim
 i could not find myself worthy of love or love in such a way that anyone could create any passion for me, and less aggression
 aaj, main 'ishwar kaa aabhaar' maanati hum
 More importantly, feminist is not fit until we give it a place to reconcile with the past, when we foolishly defended that violence
 agar gunjaaish hoti, to khwahishon badalati jatil prakruti shaayad adhik kathor vaartalap karti
 It is also shocking that the film would have created more uproar but far more violent practices such as calling the Trans Bill inhuman, which got the President's assent on December 5, 2019, and is now the law

 main aise bahut-se doctoron ko jaanata hum jo apane bangale bechakar ab multistory buildingon main ja rahe hai
 Actually, most of such people have children outside and only husband and wife are left in the house

 He feels that highrise building does not mean that there is a shortage of space in the city, only then this option is considered
 unki baat main dam he
 On reaching Meerut from Delhi, if you leave the path leading to the city and catch the bypass, then you will see a tableau of multi-storey buildings on both sides
 bahut-si imaaraten banakar taiyaar hone kii sthiti main hai to kai imaaraton kii neenv kii eent rakhi ja rahi he
 Those who like to ride in cars and fast life are now liking the traffic jams within the city of Meerut and the bypass outside the city instead of the life moving in a delayed rhythm
 or yahaan teji se ugti imaaraten isaki sanad hai
 There are also quite tall buildings on the old delhi-meerut road

 In this way, the price of flats has doubled in the last five years
 shahar main ban rahi oonchi imaaraton main is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa ja rahaa he ki ye skool-college ke paas hon
 Later, facilities like banks and hospitals will also come in such premises
 haalanki sahi sivarej line or pine ke pani kii pipeline ab bhi is tarah kii imaaraton ke liye badi chunauti hai
 Despite building on such a large scale, these two basic requirements do not appear to be on the top of the builder's agenda
 zyaadaatar coloniyaan boring kaa pani uplabdh karaane kii baat kar rahi hai, lekin gudgaanv or noida ke tajurbe se yah baat khud-ba-khud saaf he ki aise main antat: logon ko pine kaa pani kharidkar hi pinaa padegaa
 On the question of why there is no pipeline to these colonies, Meerut Mayor Harikant Ahluwalia said, "the responsibility of passing the map of the colonies lies with the Meerut Development Authority
 is bare main behatar koordination kii jarurat he or yah pehle hi pataa kar lenaa chahie ki nigam kaa pipeline bichaane kaa plan kis tarah kaa he
 "according to you, what is the biggest challenge in Meerut city? On this question, Meerut MP Rajendra Aggarwal said, "meerut is an old city

 In fact, the geographical location of the city of Meerut is such that it is now not only the major city of western Uttar Pradesh but also the largest city close to Delhi after Ghaziabad and Noida
 jis tarah se yahaan rapid rail coridor banane kii baat aage badi he, usase aane vaale samay main dilli se meerut kii duuri mushkil se paune ghante main puri kii ja sakegi
 At the same time, it is also expected that after the construction of many more bypasses, it will take less time to go from Delhi to Meerut by road

 mukhya ghat har kii paudi ke sameep qatari main khadey switsraland ke victor scandia ne bataaya ki main jaipur main tha
 There i got information about this huge religious event and i came here to see it
 mana ja rahaa he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne dilli ucch nyaayalay ke us faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kar di he jisamen usne kaha tha ki pradhan nyaayadhish kaa karyaalay artiai adhinium ke daayre main aata he
 Highly placed sources said that an appeal has been filed against the January 12 decision of the High Court
 yah apil tab daayar kii gai jab ucchtam nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon main faisle ko chunauti dene ko lekar sarvasammati bani
 Sources said that Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan also consulted the other judges of the apex court and the grounds he has created are similar to the grounds taken in the High Court
 usamen usne kaha tha ki sijeai ke paas jo soochna he, uskaa khulaasa karne se nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa prabhavit hogi
 He said that the Attorney General would plead on behalf of the Supreme Court Registry
 is maamle ke jald hi sunwaayee ke liye soochibaddh kiye jane kii ummid he
 Sources said that the apex court will demand a stay on the direction of the High Court and will plead to hand it over to the larger bench or constitution bench
 sutron ne kaha ki apil kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh ke baad daayar kii gai kyonki shuruuaat main sheersh adaalat ke nyaayadhishon main is baat par matbhed tha ki apil kii jaae athwa nahin
 In a historic judgment, the Delhi High Court on January 12 said that the office of the Chief Justice comes under the purview of the RTI Act
 usne ucchtam nyaayalay kii apil ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa nyaayadhish kaa nijee visheshadhikaar nahin he, balki use ek jimmedaari di gai he
 The High Court verdict is considered a shock for Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan, who has been consistently saying that his office does not come under the purview of the RTI Act
 sutron ne bataaya ki sheersh adaalat ucch nyaayalay ke nirdesh par roak lagane kii maang karegi or vah ise vrahat peeth yaa samvidhan peeth ko saunpane kii daleel degi
