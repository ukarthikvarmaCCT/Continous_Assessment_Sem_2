 ' Ayushman Khurana's wife Teetahira Kashyapambre has been found to develop cells of breast cancer

 Tahira wrote, "I have DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in the right breast
 ab main angelina joli kaa half indian varjan ho gai hum
 i told my doctor that now the time has come to give competition to Kardashian
 lekin kisi ne mujhe nahin suna
 It has given me a new definition of life
 "view this post on instagraman opportunity to give competition to the Kardashians just went wasted! a week back i mentioned about ‘my badge of honour’ that i was going to receive
 And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that’s the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in a contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it’s unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can’t do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined, gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself! This post is dedicated to awareness, self love and resilience of a warrior that i know each one of us possesses❤️ # breastcancerawareness # selflove # determination # faith # bodhisattva # bodhisattvaoftheeartha post shared bytahirakashyap (@tahirakashyap) onsep 22, 2018 at 1:59 am PDT Tahira also shared a photo of the hospital
 unhone likhaa he ki ye tasviir aapako pareshaan kar sakati he, magar yahi sach he
 Also, i want to make women of all ages aware
 main 35 saal kii hum, or mujhe mammogram se do baar waapas kar diya gaya tha
 If a symptom occurs, think of it as a protective form and get yourself tested
 tahiraa ne likhaa, “aasaan shabdon main samajhen to shuruaati charan (stage 0) / cancer se pehle kaa charan he jahaan cancer kaarak koshikaayen kisi ek hi jagah par bad rahi hoti hai
 As a result, i have become half the Indian version of Angelina Jolie (because there is cancer in the same breast)
 i told my doctor this time that it was time to give Kardashian some competition because Pamela's time has passed

 Veteran cricketer Yuvraj Singh's decision to train at NCA (national Cricket Academy) by not playing a Ranji Trophy match is not liked by a section of BCCI officials

 But whether to leave the Ranji Trophy is a good thing or not, Yuvraj will have to decide
 'adhikari ne kaha, ‘kya iskaa matlab he ki agar vah 16
 1 (fitness standard set by the Indian team management) and there are no runs in their account, will they be selected for the limited overs series against Sri Lanka? However, the matter could not be negotiated with Yuvraj
 bisisiai adhikari ne saath hi kaha, ‘hamane suna he ki yuvaraj ne punjab team prabandhan ko bataaya he ki unhen bhartiya team ne fitness test karaane ko kaha he, jabaki chayankartaaon ne hameshaa hi ranjai trophy ke pradarshan par jor diya he
 Look at Ishant Sharma - he is also a part of the Indian team, but released him a day before the Kolkata Test, so that he can play a Ranji Trophy match against Maharashtra

 agast 2017 main 33 fisadi janata narendra modi ko best piem maanate the or tab indira gandhi ko mahaj 17 fisadi log best piem maanate the
 But Narendra Modi's popularity has steadily declined from the last two surveys

 Politics is like a Manmohan Desai film, which begins with a flashback, in which two boys run away breaking the shackles of their surroundings and grow up in the air while jumping over the moving rail from the bridge
 parde par likhaa aata he 'intermishan'
 The film ends, but the structure of reality and contradiction remains real and on the screen life, so defeat and victory can be the turning points of a story, but it does not necessarily make much of the basic questions
 Makes a difference
 2011-13 kii dilli ne jo ummiden jagaain thim, ve ab kahaan hai
 Questions of changing politics must have been singing Gulzar's song - "I have some stuff with you, one hundred and sixteen moon nights, one mole of your shoulder, the smell of wet henna, the promise of falsehood, give it away
" 
 
 " kahin aisa to nahin ki dilli us theatre se nikalakar 'happy new year' jaisi chaturthastareey film dekhne main magan ho gai he, jahaan naitikta kaa matlab sirf jeet he
 The thieves won, but won for India
 vaise is film ne kamai ke record bhi banaae hai
 The issue of black money and corruption has now turned into a rage
 lokapal kaa junun us shaamiyane kii tarah ujaad gaya he, jiske bheetar kursi kahin se ai thi or laudspikar kahin se
 Everyone has gone away with their belongings
 vittamantri sieji ko salaah dete hai ki nitiyon ke kai paksh ho sakate hai
 The decision that has been taken, do not make that sensation, leave the headline hungry
 phir safai aati he ki baat ko sandarbh se katkar pesh kiya gaya, lekin yah nahin bataaya jaataa ki vah baat kya thi, jo cat-chant gai
 Our leaders are the editors
 kab sandarbh samaapt kar mudde ko mahaz naare main samet dete hai or kab naare ko kinare lagaakar sandarbh samajhane kii apil karne lagate hai, iskaa faisla unheen ke paas surakshit he
 Three lakhs will come in everyone's account or not, now it has become a case of rage in place of outrage
 jab pataa nahin tha, tab sansad main bahes kii maang kyon hui, sthagan kyon hue, yatraaen kyon nikaali gayi
 Where did those documents come from, based on which it was said that there is millions of crores of black money in the country
 radio par pradhanmantri kehete hai ki kisi ko pataa nahin ki kaala dhan kitna he, par pai-pai laaenge, iskaa bharosa un par kiijie
 So, was the issue of corruption fake, then why were the leaders saying that no one knew
 do sawaal hai
 One is about getting black money and another to eradicate corruption
 kya ye donon sawaal is kadar bemaani ho chuke hai ki ab in par sirf latife hi banaae ja sakate hai
 If Manmohan Singh used to say the same thing, he does not know how much black money is there, then what would the media and social media of 2013 deal with him
 ab kiran bedi, baba ramdev sab chup hai
 Everyone has left this question to the trust of only one person
 tab to inkaa sawaal kuch or tha ki bhrashtachar ke sawaal ko kisi ek vyakti yaa sarkaar ke bharose choda hi nahin ja saktaa
 This work can only be done by the Lokpal
 kya aap daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki lokapal ko lekar vaisaa aakrosh ab bhi he
 There is no Lokpal for eleven months and now there is no statement about it
 rajyon main bhrashtachar ke sawaal par to ab kareeb-kareeb khamoshi-si chaa gai he
 Just like the Central Government will end corruption and that too these two judges of SIT, who seem to be expecting an alternative Lokpal at the moment, but their claim is also strange
 ek saal main thik-thaak pataa kar lenge kaale dhan ke bare main
 The question was of a system like Lokpal, which would have started a fight against this epidemic
 is andolan ne raajnneeti main kai nayak die
 It is another matter that his heroism merges with another hero
 ab har doosraa-teesraa 'tatpunjia andolan' bhi 'azaadi kii duusari ladaai' kaha jane laga he
 Most of the anti-corruption heroes of Delhi have declared their allegiance, on the basis of which their silence and assertiveness is being decided
 tab to 'na bhrashtachar na, abaki baar na
 
 
 If an expectation was broken, a hunger would come and take care of it
 ab yah sab nautanki main badal diya gaya he
 Unknowingly, FM radio has turned democratic events into farce
 2013 main dilli bhrashtachar ke sawaal par thik se apana paksh tay nahin kar pai
 The more the BJP likes, the more the Aam Aadmi Party
 congress ko jo sazaa mili, use vahi sazaa desh bhar main mili
 Then BJP and Aam Aadmi Party were fighting not with each other, but with Congress
 is baar ladaai badal jaaegi
 The BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party are face to face and the Congress is finding some place for itself in this battle
 lekin kya vaaki aam aadmi party saamne-saamne se bijepi par waar karegi
 Not BJP, it will attack Modi
 media, soshal media ke sahare is ladaai ko vyaktigat bana diya jayega
 This is the reality
 par kya dilli khud ko is vyaktivaadee raajnneeti se nikalakar system se jude muddon par koi samajhadaari kaayam karegi
 Will change the direction of the debate
 kya aam aadmi party janalokapal or bhrashtachar ke sawaal par us bhavukta ko dobaaraa rach paaegi, jo usne un do saalon main kiya tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party will contest the election of its establishment on the basis of the issue on which it was established
 2013 or 2014 kii dilli kaaphi badal gai he
 The election of Delhi will decide the direction of Indian politics this time
 vah yah ki ab raajnneeti vahi hogi, jo madhyamvarg chahega
 He is currently watching politics like a TV serial, where characters dressed in new clothes make him cry, sometimes laughing
 is chunaav main dilli ke liye kuch nahin he
 Like there was nothing for Delhi in that election
 aam aadmi party ab ek raajnneetik dal main dhal chuki he
 There is no longer an army of novice social workers who went out to change politics
 uske raajnneetik antarvirodh bhi saamne aate rahete hai
 Within which the battle for political supremacy started after the Lok Sabha debacle had come to an end, but will emerge again after this election
 dilli kaa faisla batayega ki bhavishya main nai party ke liye raajnneetik spes kya rahegaa
 It will never end, but new types of lessons will be maintained about that space
 philhal ek baat aam aadmi party ke paksh main zarur jaati he ki uske vidhayak nahin toote
 No one created a space for BJP by resigning from outside his party and taking a stand
 dekhte hai ki arvind kejariwal apane un muddon ko chhod dete hai yaa unheen ke sahare phir maidan main utarate hai yaa nahin
 This election will not be as much as of Narendra Modi, it will be of Arvind Kejriwal
 is bich janata unhen kuch din sarkaar main or bahut din vipaksh main dekh chuki he
 The sentiment and magic of social media resources created by Kejriwal's team has been adopted by the BJP in a big way
 yah chunaav do dalon ke sansadhano ke pradarshan ke takaraav kaa bhi chunaav hone ja rahaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party will always be weaker than the BJP in terms of resources, so the real test of AAP begins now
 dilli ji, lock kiya jaae - amitabh kii style main bolen to
 Let's see, who locks Delhi
 kai log kah rahe hai ki yah chunaav aam aadmi party ke liye 'karo or maro' kaa chunaav hoga
 He estimates that if the opposition becomes fit, the party will end
 koi party vipaksh main aakar khatm kaise ho jaati he
 Did the BJP end after 15 years in opposition in Maharashtra
 kya centre main 10 saal satta se baahar rahakar bijepi khatm ho gai thi
 But in Indian politics, Arvind Kejriwal has not even brought himself into the circle of these questions by choosing a small reference and target like Delhi
 jab dilli nahin to phir kahaan
 The future of the Aam Aadmi Party will also be at stake after this election
 meraa apana maananaa he ki hindustan kii janata bhrashtachar ke sawaal par eemaandaar nahin he
 He who will jump into the fire over this issue will die by burning
 janata bhrashtachar system kii labhaarthi he
 He finds his other loyalties above corruption
 vah bhrashtachar ke saath jeena sikh chuki he
 He has got 'stockholm Syndrome' from this issue and the politics of the country
 jo utpeedak he, usee se pyaar ho gaya he use
 If Arvind falsifies this notion, the Aam Aadmi Party will come back to life as an expectation again in Modi's domination politics and era
 daanv to sirf 'aap' kaa he
 To survive and disappear
 yah chunaav ab 'aap' kaa he, janata kaa nahin
 What Arvind used to say is that the election belongs to the public, only he will win or he will lose
 zaraa sochie
 If BJP wins, how will Narendra Modi speak? modi to jitate hi aa rahe hai
 Debates are going on according to their spread accounts
 baaki dal or netaa apane antarvirodhon se bhaag rahe hai to modi rose ek nayaa antarvirodh paidaakar ke bhi batch nikal ja rahe hai
 There are anti-confuse whether to attack Modi or not
 modi ko is tarah kaa kanfuzan nahin he
 He attacks on whomever he wants
 vah ek nahin, hazaar tir lekar utarate hai
 They keep dropping left and right without looking
 haalanki unka har kadam yojana ke hisaab se hi hota he
 TV and media see only one and only warrior fighting and what they see in this world is sold
 kya arvind kejariwal modi par us tarah se sidhe target kar paaenge
 The BJP will take the help of them
 congress ke liye bhi nae netritv ko aazamaane kaa mauka he
 Will she be able to stand up? shila dikshit ke sahare maidan main utregi yaa phir koi or nayaa netaa aayega
 It has to be kept in mind that this time also Delhi's election will be for any political change
 dilli ne raajnneeti ko badalane kaa sapana chhod diya he
 If Delhi wanted change, it would not have been so silent on the events of Bawana and Trilokpuri
 vah in ghatnaon ke samarthan main bhale mukhar nahin he, lekin logon kaa maun sampradayik dhruvikaran purna ho chukaa he
 Since, like secularism, it is also a bad word, the Nephi section of Delhi will not demonstrate it
 kinhin or bahaanon ke sahare is par chup rahegaa
 Had Bawana's panchayat been in UP, by now many questions would have been pointed out at the Akhilesh government that the SP had been with the BJP, so that both of them could take advantage of this polarization together
 dilli main javabdehi ke sawaal par waisi aakraamakata gaayab he
 Why no one has said that in Delhi, whose permission is there for getting Mahapanchayats in Delhi, where the Red Fort has been called to join the country by banning communalism for 10 years
 kyon tanaav ho rahe hai
 Why don't the Prime Minister publicly scold us at such a time
 meri nazar he aisi ghatnaon par
 That too can be expected from a prime minister whose time is spent in media
 aam aadmi party ne bhi sampradayikta ke khilaaf stand lekar yatraaen nahin nikaalin
 Do not distribute leaflets from house to house
 congress or 'aap' ne median bayaan dene kii aupchaarikta bhar puri kii
 Otherwise, one could think of doing a panchayat in harmony parallel to Bawana
 sab is sawaal par kanfus hai, kyonki unhen dar he ki loksabhaa kii tarah secularism ke bed verde ban jane kaa nuksaan na uthaanaa pade
 This is politics
 nuksaan uthaakar bhi aap apane aadarshon ko nahi choden
 But what will we do when the front is bent on winning by giving all kinds of ideals? chunavi raajnneeti kii yahi to seemaa he
 Everyone has to get stuck in it
 naitikta tivi studio main bahes ke liye bachi rah jaati he

 Modi drew comparisons between President Pranab Mukherjee and the Prime Minister's speeches made on the eve of Independence Day today and criticized Manmohan Singh for not taking a hard line about Pakistan in his speech
 modi ne kaha, raashtrapati hamaare paanch sainikon ke maare jane ke mudde par chintaa jaahir kar chuke hai
 i expected the Prime Minister to express similar concerns, but he failed to talk hard
 mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko pakistan ko chetavanee di thi ki ‘‘sanyam kii seemaa hoti he’’ or aatanrik suraksha sunishchit karne tathaa kshetreey akhandta ko surakshit rakhane ke liye ‘‘jaruri kadam ’’ uthaae jaaenge
 Describing the Prime Minister's speech as "a big disappointment", Modi said that there was no life in it and it failed to give any kind of inspiration
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, mujhe is baat par hairaani hoti he ki sarvaadhik baar rashtriya dhvaj fahraane vaali hastiyon main aapkaa naam shaamil ho rahaa he, lekin aap vahi baaten kar rahe hai jo pandit nehru ne raashtra ke naam apane pehle sambodhan main kahi thim
 Modi said that Singh is still referring to the same problems and concerns that Nehru mentioned in his first speech
 unhone sawaal kiya, sawaal yah uthta he ki aapane pichley 60 saal main kya kiya
 If there is not even a slight change in the situation
 
 
 to aapane kya kiya he? maujuuda aarthik halaat ke liye pradhanmantri par barasate hue modi ne kaha, shriman pradhanmantri, aapane desh kii vartmaan aarthik haalat kaa zikr karte hue purv pradhanmantri narsingh raav kii baat kii, lekin main aapse poochna chahta hum ki rupee kii keemat jis tarah se gir rahi he, yah sankat kii ore ja rahaa he , uske liye koun jimmedaar he? Criticizing the Center for not taking remedial steps to rectify the economic 'mess', Modi said that Singh could have done at least as much to tell the nation how he would strengthen the rupee and rejuvenate the economy
 What steps are being taken to put it
 unhone kaha, iske bajaay aap iskaa thikra vaishvik aarthik mandi ke sir par phod rahe hai or kehete hai ki bharat vaishvik mandi se achoota nahin rah saktaa
 Modi said, Indian soldiers have been killed and some encouraging things should have been said to encourage the soldiers
 main nahin samajhataa ki laal kila pakistan ko chunauti dene ke liye uchit manch he or na hi hamen isamen samay barbaad karnaa chahie, lekin yah hamaare sainya balon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye uchit manch tha
 He said, this is my feeling
 
 
 unhen (pradhanmantri) hamaare sainikon kaa manobal badhanaa chahie tha
 Modi said, on one hand the President is saying that our restraint is limited but what is the limit of this restraint, President? What is the boundary line for this
 
 
 iskaa faisla centre kii sarkaar ko karnaa hoga
 He said, what is the reason that we do not know
 
 
 hamaari seemaa kya he
 
 
 
 kab tak ham bardaasht karte rahenge
 
 isko saaf bataaya janaa chahie
 And it is not only a question of Pakistan, the security of the nation is in danger today
 unhone aarope lagaaya, china ne kya kiya he? ek aaazaad bharat main aaj china ghus aata he or hamaari seemaa par avarohak khadey kar detaa he
 
 
 He comes and touches our area
 bhrashtachar par raashtrapati dwaara jataai gai chintaaon kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, bharat ke raashtrapati ne bhrashtachar par apni gahari chintaa jaahir kii he
 He expressed his sorrow over it in his speech on Wednesday
 behatar hota ki lalakile se bhi bhrashtachar ke bare main kuch bolaa jaataa
 He said, the Prime Minister is your first right to respect the feelings and concerns of the President, but that has not happened today
 modi ne sawalia andaaj main kaha, ham bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yuddh kyon nahin ched sakate or
 
 
 Brothers and sisters
 
 
 is bhrashtachar kaa janm kahaan se hua he ?
 
 
 Does the country not need to know this? unhone kaha, kya deshvasi is par jawaab nahin maangenge? main raajnneetik bhashaa main baat nahin karnaa chahta, lekin main kahana chahta hum ki bhrashtachar desh ke samaksh sabase mahatvapurn mudda he
 
 
 
 yah hamaare desh kaa dard, or santaap he
 Modi said, in the old-fashioned television serials, nepotism was the main reason for corruption
 
 
 samay badalane ke saath yah badal gaya he
 
 
 a new serial of maternal uncle and nephew came on corruption and now it is moving towards the transition of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law to serial
 modi ne gandhi parivaar ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, bhrashtachar hamaare desh ko nasht kar rahaa he or jo desh par raaj kar rahe hai, unke parivaar aankath (bhrashtachar main) duube hai
 Until the Supreme Court reprimands them, they keep a constant silence and engage in it
 unhone kaha, isliye, bhaaiyon or bahanon, raashtrapatiji kaa bayaan ham sabhi se atmavlokan kaa aahvaan karata he or yah chintaa sheersh par honi chahie
 President Mukherjee said on Wednesday, corruption has become a major challenge
 desh ke amuly sansaadhan kahili tathaa udaseenta ke kaaran nasht ho rahe hai
 They are blunting the dynamics of our society
 hamen ise rokane kii jarurat he
 Modi, in his hour-long speech, also raised the issue of the Parliament being obstructed by the ruling party
 unhone kaha, yadi vipakshi dal apni aawaaj uthaate hai to loktantr main ise samajha ja saktaa he, lekin chintaa kii baat yah he ki desh main pehali baar sattarudh party loksabhaa nahin chalane de rahi he or uske kaamkaaj main baadha daal rahi he
 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he
 After this Modi said, Sardar Patel, who devoted his entire life to the service of Congress, you do not remember that too, we are pained at this
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak or pradhanmantri ko is mudde par likhe patr kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, behatar hota ki pradhanmantri desh ko yah bataate
 The comments unhone kaha, maine pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhaa he or suzav diya he ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak main kai khamiyaan hai, jinhen durust kiye jane kii jarurat he

 He expressed his sorrow over it in his speech on Wednesday
 behatar hota ki lalakile se bhi bhrashtachar ke bare main kuch bolaa jaataa
 He said, the Prime Minister is your first right to respect the feelings and concerns of the President, but that has not happened today
 modi ne sawalia andaaj main kaha, ham bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yuddh kyon nahin ched sakate or
 
 
 Brothers and sisters
 
 
 is bhrashtachar kaa janm kahaan se hua he ?

 Modi said, in the old-fashioned television serials, nepotism was the main reason for corruption

 modi ne gandhi parivaar ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, bhrashtachar hamaare desh ko nasht kar rahaa he or jo desh par raaj kar rahe hai, unke parivaar aankath (bhrashtachar main) duube hai
 Until the Supreme Court reprimands them, they keep a constant silence and engage in it

 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he

 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure

 Modi said, the President has expressed concern over the issue of the killing of our five soldiers
 mujhe ummid thi ki pradhanmantri isi prakaar kii chintaa jataayenge lekin vah kadi baat karne main vifal rahe

" modi ne kaha ki singh aaj bhi unheen samasyaon or chintaaon kaa ullekh kar rahe hai jinka zikr nehru ne apane pehle bhaashan main kiya tha
 He questioned, the question arises what have you done in the last 60 years
 yadi halaat main maamuli-sa badlaav bhi nahin aayaa he
 
 
 So what have you done? Lashing out at the Prime Minister for the current economic situation, Modi said, Mr
 Prime Minister, you spoke of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, referring to the current economic condition of the country, but i want to ask you that the way the value of rupee is falling
 , This is going towards crisis, who is responsible for it? aarthik ‘gadabadi’ ko durust karne ke liye upachaaratmak kadam nahin uthaane ke liye centre kii aalochana karte hue modi ne kaha ki singh kam se kam itnaa to kar sakate the ki ve desh ko bataate ki vah kaise rupee ko majboot karenge or arthvyavastha main nai jaan daalane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 He said, instead you are blaming it on the head of global economic recession and says that India cannot remain untouched by the global recession
 modi ne kaha, bhartiya sainik maare gaye hai or javaanon kaa hausala badhaane ke liye kuch utsahjanak baaten kahi jaani chahie thim
 i do not think that the Red Fort is the appropriate platform to challenge Pakistan, nor should we waste time in it, but it was the appropriate platform to raise the morale of our military forces
 unhone kaha, yah meri bhaavana he
 
 
 He (prime Minister) should have boosted the morale of our soldiers
 modi ne kaha, ek taraf raashtrapatiji kah rahe hai ki hamaare sanyam kii seemaa he lekin raashtrapati ji is sanyam kii kya seemaa he? iske liye seemaa rekha kya he
 
 
 The central government will have to decide this

 What is our limit 
 
 
 How long will we tolerate
 
 It should be clearly stated
 or yah keval pakistan kaa sawaal nahin he, aaj raashtra kii suraksha khatre main he

 vah hamaare kshetra main aakar dat jaataa he
 Referring to the concerns raised by the President on corruption, Modi said, the President of India has expressed his deep concern over corruption

 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji raashtrapati ji kii bhaawanaaon or chintaaon kaa sammaan karnaa aapkaa pehla adhikaar he, lekin aaj aisa nahin hua
 Modi asked in a questioning manner, why can't we wage a war against corruption and
 
 
 bahanon-bhaaiyon
 
 
 Where is this corruption born from? 
 
 kya desh ko yah jaanane kii jarurat nahin he?

 This is the pain, and anguish of our country
 modi ne kaha, puraane jamaane ke televijan dharawahikon main bhai bhatijawad bhrashtachar kii mukhya vajah hota tha

 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he

 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ji, laal bahadur shastri, aapaki apni party ke pradhanmantri the
 Is it not better that when you were mentioning Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira ji and Rajiv ji, you would have also mentioned Lal Bahadur Shastri ji
 vah bhi hamaare desh ke pradhanmantri rahe hai or unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired
 aapako shastri ji kaa bhi naam lenaa chahie tha
 He said, no politics or politics of dynasty should have come in your way
 lekin aapane aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 
 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapako atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kaa naam yaad nahin rahaa hoga
 
 
 i understand your compulsions, but why you did not remember the name of Lal Bahadur Shastriji

 He said, we are not against serving food in the plate of the poor
 is vidheyak kii kamiyon ko sahi karnaa aapaki jimmedaari he, lekin aap (pradhanmantri) hamaari baat sunne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai

 It can get caught in some legal battles and poor people will again be deprived of food security

Criticizing the Center for not taking remedial steps to rectify the economic 'mess', Modi said that Singh could have done at least as much to tell the nation how he would strengthen the rupee and rejuvenate the economy
 What steps are being taken to put it
 unhone kaha, iske bajaay aap iskaa thikra vaishvik aarthik mandi ke sir par phod rahe hai or kehete hai ki bharat vaishvik mandi se achoota nahin rah saktaa
 Modi said, Indian soldiers have been killed and some encouraging things should have been said to encourage the soldiers

 President Mukherjee said on Wednesday, corruption has become a major challenge
 desh ke amuly sansaadhan kahili tathaa udaseenta ke kaaran nasht ho rahe hai
 They are blunting the dynamics of our society
 hamen ise rokane kii jarurat he
 Modi, in his hour-long speech, also raised the issue of the Parliament being obstructed by the ruling party
 unhone kaha, yadi vipakshi dal apni aawaaj uthaate hai to loktantr main ise samajha ja saktaa he, lekin chintaa kii baat yah he ki desh main pehali baar sattarudh party loksabhaa nahin chalane de rahi he or uske kaamkaaj main baadha daal rahi he
 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he
 After this Modi said, Sardar Patel, who devoted his entire life to the service of Congress, you do not remember that too, we are pained at this
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak or pradhanmantri ko is mudde par likhe patr kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, behatar hota ki pradhanmantri desh ko yah bataate
 The comments unhone kaha, maine pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhaa he or suzav diya he ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak main kai khamiyaan hai, jinhen durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 We have not opposed the Bill
 unhone kaha, ham garibon kii thali main khaanaa parose jane ke khilaaf nahin hai
 It is your responsibility to correct the shortcomings of this bill, but you (prime Minister) are not ready to listen to us
 modi ne kaha, garib logon kii thali main khaanaa parosane ke bajaay yah sarkaar garib logon kii thali main acid paros rahi he, namak chhidak rahi he
 He said, the Food Security Bill has failed to increase the number of beneficiaries, it has failed to raise the quality of food, it has failed to reduce the price of food
 
 
 or iske baavjood aap daawa kar rahe hai ki yah logon ke liye acha he
 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure
 yah kuch kanoonee ladaai main funs saktaa he or garib log phir se bhojan suraksha se vanchit rah jaaenge
 He also said, "we want this bill to be a good bill and for this i had suggested to the Prime Minister that he should call a meeting of all Chief Ministers"
 yadi aapako garibon kii chintaa thi to aapako baithak bulaakar vidheyak kii kamiyon par vichaar karnaa chahie tha
 He questioned, the question arises what have you done in the last 60 years
 yadi halaat main maamuli-sa badlaav bhi nahin aayaa he
 
 
 So what have you done? Lashing out at the Prime Minister for the current economic situation, Modi said, Mr
 Prime Minister, you spoke of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, referring to the current economic condition of the country, but i want to ask you that the way the value of rupee is falling
 , This is going towards crisis, who is responsible for it? aarthik ‘gadabadi’ ko durust karne ke liye upachaaratmak kadam nahin uthaane ke liye centre kii aalochana karte hue modi ne kaha ki singh kam se kam itnaa to kar sakate the ki ve desh ko bataate ki vah kaise rupee ko majboot karenge or arthvyavastha main nai jaan daalane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 He said, instead you are blaming it on the head of global economic recession and says that India cannot remain untouched by the global recession
 modi ne kaha, bhartiya sainik maare gaye hai or javaanon kaa hausala badhaane ke liye kuch utsahjanak baaten kahi jaani chahie thim
 i do not think that the Red Fort is the appropriate platform to challenge Pakistan, nor should we waste time in it, but it was the appropriate platform to raise the morale of our military forces
 unhone kaha, yah meri bhaavana he
 
 
 He (prime Minister) should have boosted the morale of our soldiers
 modi ne kaha, ek taraf raashtrapatiji kah rahe hai ki hamaare sanyam kii seemaa he lekin raashtrapati ji is sanyam kii kya seemaa he? iske liye seemaa rekha kya he
 
 
 The central government will have to decide this
 unhone kaha, kya kaaran he ki hamen nahin pataa ki
 
 
 What is our limit 
 
 
 How long will we tolerate
 
 It should be clearly stated
 or yah keval pakistan kaa sawaal nahin he, aaj raashtra kii suraksha khatre main he
 He alleged, what has China done? Today China enters an independent India and creates barriers on our border
 
 
 vah hamaare kshetra main aakar dat jaataa he
 Referring to the concerns raised by the President on corruption, Modi said, the President of India has expressed his deep concern over corruption
 unhone buudhvaar ko apane bhaashan main is par apane dukh kaa izhaar kiya
 It would have been better to have spoken about corruption than the Red Fort
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji raashtrapati ji kii bhaawanaaon or chintaaon kaa sammaan karnaa aapkaa pehla adhikaar he, lekin aaj aisa nahin hua
 Modi asked in a questioning manner, why can't we wage a war against corruption and
 
 
 bahanon-bhaaiyon
 
 
 Where is this corruption born from? 
 
 kya desh ko yah jaanane kii jarurat nahin he?
 He said, will the countrymen not ask for an answer on this? i do not want to speak in political language, but i want to say that corruption is the most important issue before the country
 
 
 
 This is the pain, and anguish of our country
 modi ne kaha, puraane jamaane ke televijan dharawahikon main bhai bhatijawad bhrashtachar kii mukhya vajah hota tha
 
 
 This has changed over time
 
 
 bhrashtachar par mamaa or bhaanje kaa nayaa dharawahik aayaa or ab yah saas, bahu or damaad ke serial main parivartit hone kii ore bad rahaa he
 Modi indirectly targeted the Gandhi family and said, "corruption is destroying our country and those who are ruling the country, their families are submerged (in corruption)"
 jab tak ucchtam nyaayalay unhen fatkaar nahin lagaataa, ve lagaataar chuppi saadhe rahete hai or isamen jute rahete hai
 He said, therefore, brothers and sisters, the statement of Rashtrapati calls upon all of us to introspect and this concern should be at the top
 raashtrapati mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha, bhrashtachar ek mukhya chunauti ban gaya he
 The priceless resources of the country are being destroyed due to kohli and apathy
 yah hamaare samaaj kii gatishiltaa ko kund kar rahe hai
 We need to stop this
 modi ne apane ghantabar ke bhaashan main sattarudh party dwaara sansad ko baadhit kiye jane kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he
 He said in response to the President's concern about the disruption of Parliament, we should do our best to maintain the pride of Parliament, the temple of democracy
 modi ne apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri dwaara keval ek parivaar ko yaad karne or baaki sabhi anya mahaan netaaon ko bhuulane ke liye pradhanmantri par hamalaa bolaa or kaha, pradhanmantri ji, badi niraashaa kii baat he ki lalakile se aapane keval ek parivaar ke bare main bolaa
 Is it not better that today you should have remembered Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a person who united India, would it not have been better if a good message that united the country was given
 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ji, laal bahadur shastri, aapaki apni party ke pradhanmantri the
 Is it not better that when you were mentioning Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira ji and Rajiv ji, you would have also mentioned Lal Bahadur Shastri ji
 vah bhi hamaare desh ke pradhanmantri rahe hai or unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired
 aapako shastri ji kaa bhi naam lenaa chahie tha
 He said, no politics or politics of dynasty should have come in your way
 lekin aapane aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 
 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapako atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kaa naam yaad nahin rahaa hoga
 
 
 i understand your compulsions, but why you did not remember the name of Lal Bahadur Shastriji
 
 
 
 i am not digesting this
 modi ne iske baad kaha, sardaar patel, jinhone puraa jivan congress kii seva main laga diya, aapako vah bhi yaad nahin rahe, is par hamen dil main pidaa hoti he
 Referring to the Food Security Bill and the letter written to the Prime Minister on this issue, Modi said, it would have been better if the Prime Minister had told the country
 tippaniyan He said, i have written a letter to the Prime Minister and suggested that there are many flaws in the Food Security Bill, which needs to be rectified
 hamane vidheyak kaa virodh nahin kiya he
 He said, we are not against serving food in the plate of the poor
 is vidheyak kii kamiyon ko sahi karnaa aapaki jimmedaari he, lekin aap (pradhanmantri) hamaari baat sunne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 Modi said, instead of serving food in the plate of poor people, this government is serving acid in the plate of poor people, sprinkling salt
 unhone kaha, khaadya suraksha vidheyak labhaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaane main vifal rahaa he, yah bhojan kii gunvattta badhaane main vifal rahaa he, yah bhojan kii keemat kam karne main vifal rahaa he
 
 
 And yet you are claiming that it is good for the people
 mukhyamantri modi ne kaha, is vidheyak ne jis tarah se hamaare sangheey dhaanche kii buniyaad kii andekhi kii he, main usase chintit hum
 It can get caught in some legal battles and poor people will again be deprived of food security
 unhone iske saath hi kaha, ham chaahate hai ki yah vidheyak ek acha vidheyak ho or iske liye maine pradhanmantri ko suzav diya tha ki vah sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaaen
 If you were concerned about the poor, you should have called a meeting and considered the shortcomings of the bill

 Referring to the concerns raised by the President on corruption, Modi said, the President of India has expressed his deep concern over corruption
 unhone buudhvaar ko apane bhaashan main is par apane dukh kaa izhaar kiya
 It would have been better to have spoken about corruption than the Red Fort
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji raashtrapati ji kii bhaawanaaon or chintaaon kaa sammaan karnaa aapkaa pehla adhikaar he, lekin aaj aisa nahin hua
 Modi asked in a questioning manner, why can't we wage a war against corruption and
 
 
 bahanon-bhaaiyon
 
 
 Where is this corruption born from? 
 
 kya desh ko yah jaanane kii jarurat nahin he?
 He said, will the countrymen not ask for an answer on this? i do not want to speak in political language, but i want to say that corruption is the most important issue before the country
 
 
 
 This is the pain, and anguish of our country

 jab tak ucchtam nyaayalay unhen fatkaar nahin lagaataa, ve lagaataar chuppi saadhe rahete hai or isamen jute rahete hai
 He said, therefore, brothers and sisters, the statement of Rashtrapati calls upon all of us to introspect and this concern should be at the top
 raashtrapati mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha, bhrashtachar ek mukhya chunauti ban gaya he
 The priceless resources of the country are being destroyed due to kohli and apathy

 We need to stop this
 modi ne apane ghantabar ke bhaashan main sattarudh party dwaara sansad ko baadhit kiye jane kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he

 Is it not better that today you should have remembered Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a person who united India, would it not have been better if a good message that united the country was given
 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ji, laal bahadur shastri, aapaki apni party ke pradhanmantri the
 Is it not better that when you were mentioning Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira ji and Rajiv ji, you would have also mentioned Lal Bahadur Shastri ji
 vah bhi hamaare desh ke pradhanmantri rahe hai or unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired
 aapako shastri ji kaa bhi naam lenaa chahie tha
 He said, no politics or politics of dynasty should have come in your way
 lekin aapane aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 
 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapako atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kaa naam yaad nahin rahaa hoga
 
 
 i understand your compulsions, but why you did not remember the name of Lal Bahadur Shastriji
 
 
 
 i am not digesting this

 hamane vidheyak kaa virodh nahin kiya he
 He said, we are not against serving food in the plate of the poor
 is vidheyak kii kamiyon ko sahi karnaa aapaki jimmedaari he, lekin aap (pradhanmantri) hamaari baat sunne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 Modi said, instead of serving food in the plate of poor people, this government is serving acid in the plate of poor people, sprinkling salt
 unhone kaha, khaadya suraksha vidheyak labhaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaane main vifal rahaa he, yah bhojan kii gunvattta badhaane main vifal rahaa he, yah bhojan kii keemat kam karne main vifal rahaa he
 
 
 And yet you are claiming that it is good for the people

 It can get caught in some legal battles and poor people will again be deprived of food security
 unhone iske saath hi kaha, ham chaahate hai ki yah vidheyak ek acha vidheyak ho or iske liye maine pradhanmantri ko suzav diya tha ki vah sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaaen

 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ji, laal bahadur shastri, aapaki apni party ke pradhanmantri the

 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired

 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapako atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kaa naam yaad nahin rahaa hoga
 
 
 i understand your compulsions, but why you did not remember the name of Lal Bahadur Shastriji

 He said, we are not against serving food in the plate of the poor
 is vidheyak kii kamiyon ko sahi karnaa aapaki jimmedaari he, lekin aap (pradhanmantri) hamaari baat sunne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 Modi said, instead of serving food in the plate of poor people, this government is serving acid in the plate of poor people, sprinkling salt

 And yet you are claiming that it is good for the people
 mukhyamantri modi ne kaha, is vidheyak ne jis tarah se hamaare sangheey dhaanche kii buniyaad kii andekhi kii he, main usase chintit hum
 It can get caught in some legal battles and poor people will again be deprived of food security
 unhone iske saath hi kaha, ham chaahate hai ki yah vidheyak ek acha vidheyak ho or iske liye maine pradhanmantri ko suzav diya tha ki vah sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaaen
 If you were concerned about the poor, you should have called a meeting and considered the shortcomings of the bill
 modi ne gandhi parivaar ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, bhrashtachar hamaare desh ko nasht kar rahaa he or jo desh par raaj kar rahe hai, unke parivaar aankath (bhrashtachar main) duube hai
 Until the Supreme Court reprimands them, they keep a constant silence and engage in it
 unhone kaha, isliye, bhaaiyon or bahanon, raashtrapatiji kaa bayaan ham sabhi se atmavlokan kaa aahvaan karata he or yah chintaa sheersh par honi chahie
 President Mukherjee said on Wednesday, corruption has become a major challenge
 desh ke amuly sansaadhan kahili tathaa udaseenta ke kaaran nasht ho rahe hai
 They are blunting the dynamics of our society
 hamen ise rokane kii jarurat he
 Modi, in his hour-long speech, also raised the issue of the Parliament being obstructed by the ruling party
 unhone kaha, yadi vipakshi dal apni aawaaj uthaate hai to loktantr main ise samajha ja saktaa he, lekin chintaa kii baat yah he ki desh main pehali baar sattarudh party loksabhaa nahin chalane de rahi he or uske kaamkaaj main baadha daal rahi he
 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he
 After this Modi said, Sardar Patel, who devoted his entire life to the service of Congress, you do not remember that too, we are pained at this
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak or pradhanmantri ko is mudde par likhe patr kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, behatar hota ki pradhanmantri desh ko yah bataate
 The comments unhone kaha, maine pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhaa he or suzav diya he ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak main kai khamiyaan hai, jinhen durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 We have not opposed the Bill
 unhone kaha, ham garibon kii thali main khaanaa parose jane ke khilaaf nahin hai
 It is your responsibility to correct the shortcomings of this bill, but you (prime Minister) are not ready to listen to us
 modi ne kaha, garib logon kii thali main khaanaa parosane ke bajaay yah sarkaar garib logon kii thali main acid paros rahi he, namak chhidak rahi he
 He said, the Food Security Bill has failed to increase the number of beneficiaries, it has failed to raise the quality of food, it has failed to reduce the price of food
 
 
 or iske baavjood aap daawa kar rahe hai ki yah logon ke liye acha he
 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure
 yah kuch kanoonee ladaai main funs saktaa he or garib log phir se bhojan suraksha se vanchit rah jaaenge
 He also said, "we want this bill to be a good bill and for this i had suggested to the Prime Minister that he should call a meeting of all Chief Ministers"
 yadi aapako garibon kii chintaa thi to aapako baithak bulaakar vidheyak kii kamiyon par vichaar karnaa chahie tha
 He said, therefore, brothers and sisters, the statement of Rashtrapati calls upon all of us to introspect and this concern should be at the top
 raashtrapati mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha, bhrashtachar ek mukhya chunauti ban gaya he
 The priceless resources of the country are being destroyed due to kohli and apathy
 yah hamaare samaaj kii gatishiltaa ko kund kar rahe hai
 We need to stop this
 modi ne apane ghantabar ke bhaashan main sattarudh party dwaara sansad ko baadhit kiye jane kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he
 He said in response to the President's concern about the disruption of Parliament, we should do our best to maintain the pride of Parliament, the temple of democracy

 The lack of staff in Jal Board is also a major reason for these deaths
 jisko sarkaar ne pichley kai saalon se nazarandaaj kiya hua he
 According to information received from an RTI, more than 600 posts of Chief Engineer to Junior Engineer are lying vacant in the Jal Board, while the water board increases the scope of 10 kilometers every year

 This is the situation when the Chief Minister of Delhi is the chairman of the Jal Board and they also have the responsibility to fill the vacant posts
 iske liye naa to centre sarkaar se poochna he or naa hi alji se parmishan leni he
 Elections are also the reason for not filling vacant posts in departments for years

 Describing the General Budget 2013-14 presented by the Finance Minister p Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha on Thursday as the 'lollipop Electoral Budget', the CPI said that the budget lacks direction to generate revenue and to curb unemployment and inflation and farmers' Anything done for bhakpa ke varisht netaa gurudas dasgupta ne sansad bhawan parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki tel kii keemton main lagaataar vruddhi ho rahi he, mahangaai lagaataar bad rahi he, berogari kii sthiti kaaphi gambhir he, kisaan pareshaan he or aam logon par lagaataar boj badhata ja rahaa he

 Opposition parties are continuously attacking the Modi government in the Punjab National Bank scam of Rs 11400 crore
 lekin is baar ghar ke andar se hi party par hamalaa hua he
 Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha said in this case that the way the congress-bjp are accusing each other, the facts will not be revealed
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki acha ye hoga ki sarkaar 2011 se 2017 tak jitne bhi aloyu neerav modi kii company ko jari hue hai, unki jaankaree saarvajanik kar deni chahie
 He said that how many lous have been issued during the UPA time from May 2011 to May 2014, now it should be mentioned how many lous have been issued in the NDA government from May 2014 to 2017
 sinha ne kaha ki ye bank ke do adhikariyon ne kiya he lekin aisa nahin hai jab itani pement ek branch se release ho rahi he to RBI kii jaankaree main zarur aayaa hoga
 He said that i have also run the finance ministry, so i can say that there is also political pressure on the big officers of the bank for such loans and many times the officers of the bank come under pressure
 ab sarkaar is baat kaa shrey lene kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 The government is saying on the one hand that the FIR has been done on the instructions of PNB, and on the other side it has said that it has recovered 6 thousand crores
 haalanki, ye thik he kyonki unhone recovery kis aadhaar par kii he jo keemat demand par likhi hui hai ye abhi saaf nahin hai
 How is the government taking credit now, when the horse has fled the stables in January? neerav modi ko bharat laana itnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki ye dekhnaa hoga ki wo kis desh chupa hua he
 After that also it has to be seen whether our country has extradition treaty with that country

 loksabhaa chunaav ke siyaasi ran main is baar bollywood kii kai hastiyaan apni kismat aajamaa rahi hai
 Urmila Matondkar, who made her Bollywood debut in the 90s, is also making her political debut this time
 chunaavon ke bich hi urmila ne congress kaa haath thama or ab maharashtra kii mumbai uttar seat se maidan main hai
 Urmila's campaign continues vigorously as soon as she joins Congress
 urmila kaa muqabla isi seat se maujuuda saansad bijepi ke gopal shetty se he
 Urmila Matondkar, 45, was not active in Bollywood for a long time, but she frequently spoke on social issues
 mumbai uttar seat se pehle bhi kai baar abhinaytaon ke khate main jaati rahi he, yahi kaaran he ki congress ne urmila matondkar daanv lagaaya
 This is just the beginning of Urmila's political journey, but in the past too many times she has been campaigning for the candidates
 lekin bollywood abhinaytaon ke liye ye aam baat si rahi he
 Now Urmila has entered the political arena, the challenge is to cross the seat of the Congress on this seat
 ummidavaari ghoshit hone ke baad se hi urmila lagaataar apni seat par prachaar kar rahi hai, logon se milane ke liye vah anokhe tareeke bhi apana rahi hai
 Not only this, many Bollywood stars are also among those who campaign for him, including big names like Shabana Azmi
 bataur bal kalakaar kii kariyar kii shuruabgar unke bollywood kariyar par najar daalen to urmila ne marathi film 'jakol 1988' se saat saal kii umr main ek bal kalakaar ke rup main shuruyaat kii thi
 After which she also worked as a child actress in Shekhar Kapur's famous film 'masoom', from which she also got an identity
 kai superhit filmon main kiya kamhalanki, bataur mukhya abhinetri unki pehali film 1981 main ai ‘kalyug’ thi, jiske baad unhone narsimha, rangila, jangal, judaai or tejaab jaisi kai superhit filmein deen
 Apart from Hindi, Urmila, who has worked in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi films, has been awarded many awards like Filmfare, Screen Award
 9 saal chote kashmiri bijnesaman se kii shadisal 2000 ke baad unke filmi kariyar main giravat ai or vah tivi kii taraf bhi ain
 Urmila played the role of a judge in several TV shows
 2016 main unhone kashmiri bijnesman mohsin akhtar mir se shaadi kii
 There is a difference of about 9 years in the age of both, in age Urmila Matondkar is older than Mohsin
 filmon or tivi kii duniya ke alaava urmila kai saamaajik kaaryon main bhi hissaa leti rahi hai
 What is the equation of Urmila's seat? If you talk about Urmila's seat Mumbai North, then last time Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam got a ticket from here, but in Modi wave Gopal Shetty defeated him by a big margin
 2004 main is seat se bollywood superstar govinda bhi jeet darj kar chuke hai, govinda ne bijepi netaa or maujuuda upi ke rajyapal ram nik ko maat di thi

 Meanwhile, sources say that the Narendra Modi government at the Center is preparing to come up with a plan that could prove to be a 'game changer' during the elections

 This scheme is being considered as UBI i
e
 Universal Basic Income Scheme
 is skim ke daayre main desh ke sabhi naagarik aaenge, inamen kisaan, vyapaaree or berozegaar yuva bhi shaamil honge
 Under this scheme, from 2,000 to 2,500 rupees can be given every month to every citizen of the country
 sarkaar jiro inakam vaale sabhi nagarikon ke bank khaaton main ek tayshuda rakam sidhaa transfar karegi
 Citizens with zero income mean that those citizens who have no means of earning

 sutron ke anusaar piemo main jaldi hi alag-alag mantralayon ke saath baithak bhi karegaa jisase jaldi se jaldi skim kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya ja sake
 How will the money come into the account? Aadhaar number will be used to implement Universal Basic Income Scheme

 Till now the subsidy on domestic gas cylinders used to be transferred to the account, but after the implementation of this scheme, every kind of subsidy can be stopped

 When the Indian team lands against Lord's at the Lord's ground today, it will definitely be on their mind that it will not be late to get out in this match
 vaise pichley tii-20 main bhi kuch isi tarah ke halaat the
 In South Africa, Team India lost to New Zealand in their first match of Super 8, but reached the semi-finals after defeating England and South Africa
 is baar phir use england or dakshin africa se paar paanaa he
 But the team members are confident that they will win over England
 siyaasi chunaav main fatah hasil karne vaale harek shaks ko jaldi hi is baat kaa ehsaas ho jaataa he ki gaddinshin hote hi use laffaaji se zyada tavajjo jimmedaariyon ko deni hogi
 This feeling became almost immediately upon Imran Khan
 chunavi stump par ve pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath meljol ke liye apane kattar pratidwandvi tatkaaleen pradhanmantri navaj sharif kaa majaak udaate the or naaraa lagaate the—"modi kaa jo yaar he, wo gaddaar he''
 a week later, when the election results showed that his party was in a position to form the Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) government, Khan's tone changed and they started talking about reconciliation
 unhone vaada kiya ki agar modi donon deshon ke bich rishte sudhaarney kii disha main ek kadam aage badhayenge to ve do kadam aage badhayenge
 When Modi politely called Mubarakabad on 30 July and Khan for best wishes, the two hoped that they would be able to start a new innings in the india-pakistan relationship
 khan ke saath acchhee baat yah he ki jab hindustan ke saath rishte sudhaarney kii baat aati he tab unase ummiden bahut hi kam hai
 So if they take even a small step with the help of taking things forward , it will look big
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki 2013 main teesri baar pradhanmantri chune jate vakt lambey-chaude vaade karne vaale sharif ne haath milaane or galabahiyaan karne se zyada kuch nahin kiya
 The relationship between the two countries went into a new abyss in the last three years instead of escalating
 aupchaarik baatcheet kii prakriya dobaaraa shuru nahin ho saki, kashmir kii najuk haalat ko pakistan ke or hawa dene kii vajah se tanaav charam par pahunch gaya, niyantran rekha par sangharsh viraam ke liye 2003 main hua samjhauta lagaataar ulalanghanon ke baad taar-taar ho gaya—yahaan tak ki ek ke baad ek uksaane vaale aatanki hamalon ke silsile ke baad pakistan ko seemaa paar dehshatgardi se baj aane ke liye aagaah karne ke vaaste hindustan ko sitambar 2016 main vaaki sargical strike kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Khan is commanding such a delicate turn when his country, surrounded by difficulties, stands at an important crossroads not only in terms of its internal ups and downs but also in terms of its relations with other countries, especially India
 fatah kii apni takreer main khan ne shikaayat kii ki hindustan ne unhen bollywood ke villen ke taur par pesh kiya he
 They should have known better that it is the country that loves cricket as much as their own countries
 hindustan main khan aaj bhi cricket ke hero hai or 1992 kii unki vishwa cap kii jeet ko keval pakistan kii jeet nahin balki upmahadweep kii jeet mana jaataa he
 Now that on 11 August Khan is taking over the political captaincy of Pakistan, he must remember that there is a natural goodwill for him in the heart of Hindustani Riyaa
 or unhen ise halke dhang se ganvaana nahin chahie
 It is now known that the Pakistani army had supported his political rise only by the fact that the intention of ousting Amad Sharif was over the fight
 magar jaisaa ki purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar or pakistan visheshgy shivashankar menon kehete hai, "bhale hi har kisi ne khan ko fouj kaa pitthu kahkar khaarij kar diya ho, magar siyasatdan jab gaddi par baithta he, to vah shaks nahin balki ohade kii apni chaal-dhaal pratishthan ke saath uske rishte tay karti he
 They will follow their own religion, just as the army chiefs do
 '' visheshgy khan ko bagdor sanbhaalane ke baad chah maheene kaa vakt dete hai jab ve apni aaazaad kchayaali or majbootee se apni baat rakhane kii khubiyaan pradarshit karne lagenge, jo cricket captain ke taur par bhi unki khaasiyat rahi he
 As an icon of both cricket and society, the feeling that he has developed to be bigger and higher than his real stature has made him even more royal and emphatic in his treatment than most of his predecessors
 takreeban sabhi hindustani netaaon ne paaya he ki pakistan ke saath nipatna kisi bhi duusare mulk kii tulana main zyada pechida or mushkil he
 This is because there is no one but many Pakistanis that have to be dealt with simultaneously
 wajire-ajam ke taur par imran khan pakistan ke ek ahm chehre kii numaaindgi karte hai, par unamem se keval ek hi chehre kii
 There is also a strong Pakistani army which will try to strengthen its grip on foreign policy and internal security
 phir vahaan dakshinpanthi islamic dhade hai—unamem ugravadi bhi shaamil hai, jinhone fouj kii shah par chunaav ladakar siyaasi mukhyadhara main aane kii koshish kii thi, haalanki isamen unhen kamyaabi nahin mili
 And there is also a fast-growing civil society that wants the country to develop rapidly and provide jobs to its aspiring youth
 khan ek pechida doharepan kii numaaindgi karte hai
 He maintained his signature with modernity, even when he embraced the support of right-wing factions to advance his political prospects, as he did in the case of the military
 pakistan main purv ucchayukta tii
 C
 e
 Raghavan says, "one thing must be clearly understood that Imran is not a 100 percent military man — he is a leader on his own
" fouj ke saath unki sahuuliyat apane purvavartiyon kii banisbat zyada ho sakati he—hamaare liye yah koi buree baat nahin he
 "actually, dealing with Khan may be easier for Hindustan than Sharif, because at least when he says he will do something, he will have a military hand on his back
" isliye duusare pakistani netaaon ke saath pesh aate vakt hindustan ko jis doharepan se do-chaar hona padaa tha, vah utana majboot nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 For example, Sharif had an open confrontation with the army, which then served to oust him from the throne
 khan pakistan main sena pramukh se panga lene vaale siyasatdanon kaa hashr dekh chuke hai or sambhaavna yahi he ki ve ehtiyaat baratenge
 On the other hand, experienced Pakistanis, who believe in Pakistan, believe that the result of a change at the peak of civilian leadership in Islamabad does not necessarily reveal the status quo in its relations with India
 pakistan main ek or purv ucchayukta sharat sabharwal isaki vajah rekhaankit kar kehete hai, "fouj to apni jagah atal he or sharif ke bedakhal hone ke saath hi hindustan ke saath rishte or bhi utaar par hai
 Sabharwal is unable to find any comfort in the PTI manifesto, especially regarding the objectives of the foreign policy stated in it
 kashmir par yah ghoshnaptr ummid ke mutabik elaan karata he ki yah mul mudda he, par sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke prastaavon ke daayre main vivaad ke samaadhaan kii baat kahkar jamaane puraani laffaaji kii yaad dilaataa he
 Both countries have come far ahead of this halt long ago and any reference to it will be seen as a trick to trap Pakistan
 sabharwal ke liye zyada chintaa kii baat yah he ki hindustan ke saath muddon ko sulajhane ke liye khan ghoshnaptr main "takaraavon ke samaadhaan or sahyog ke liye suraksha ke raste ko sabase vyaavhaarik upaay'' ke taur par dekhte hai
 This means that Khan's government will play even higher bets on the resolution of the conflict, while there is no mention of improving relations on other fronts, including trade
 menon bhi maanate hai ki rishton main koi buniyadi badlaav nahin aayega, kyonki pakistan kii fouj aisa nahin chaahati
 Menon says, "this situation is favorable for Pak army
 '' chunaav ke baad faujee generalon ke saamne ab ek kamjor gathbandhan sarkaar he or yahi ve chaahate bhi the
 They can maintain a controlled level of enmity with India so that they can take advantage of it and keep hold of domestic affairs
 isse khan ko itani gunjaaish milegi ki ve hindustan ko vyast rakhane ke liye kashmir par baatcheet ko lekar thode-bahut haath-pair maar saken or faujee general yah pakkaa karne par dhyaan lagaayenge ki afghanistan par unki pakad or asar bana rahe
 US President Donald Trump is eager to end the US presence in Afghanistan and his officers have warned Pakistan that unless he is able to meet his plans in Kabul, the US will help him with the help of loans from the IMF
 Will not let out
 to kya modi khan ke saath kaam kar sakate hai? modi kii team dhyaan se dekh rahi he ki khan videsh niti par kis kism ke salaahkaaron kii niyukti karte hai or isi kii bina par vah unki eemaandaaree or asar kii thaah legi
 One thing is clear from their side that relations cannot be progressed unless Pakistan agrees to stop the factions of terrorists from using their land to attack India
 That the ceasefire agreement be enforced on the Line of Control
 agar khan in muddon se mukhaatib ho sakate hon to hindustan baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he
 The immediate question is whether Modi should go to Pakistan if Khan invites him to attend his swearing-in ceremony
 visheshgyon kii aam raay yah he ki unhen yah nyotaa sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 By doing this, he will again show to the world that Modi is sincere in his efforts to maintain peace and tranquility with Pakistan and it is Islamabad that remains obstructed
 isse modi ko kisi agenda yaa nateezon ko lekar hindustani janata kii apeksha or ummiido ke bagaiyr pakistan jane or khan se milane kaa mauka milegaa
 a face-to-face meeting will also help Modi assess Khan as a leader and he will also get a sense of whether he will be able to live up to his promises and work on important issues of common interest
 raghavan maanate hai ki donon hi mulkon main aise logon kaa ek badhata hua tabaka he jo dotarafa rishton main gatirodh ko tuutate dekhnaa chahega
 The world has seen dramatic changes in recent times — be it between the two Koreas, America's attitude toward international trade and NATO, and the rise of Xi Jinping in China
 koi vajah nahin he ki yah upmahadweep badlaav ke is lambey daur kaa apwaad bana rahe
 After all, Khan has come to power only on the slogan of New Pakistan

 a senior bowler like Azhar Mahmood, at a crucial stage, made many such mistakes which Captain Adam Gilchrist would never have expected from him
 david hasi, mandeep singh or david miller ko chhodkar ballebaaji main kisi ne saraahneey pradarshan nahin kiya he or khud captain gilcrist kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai

 gendbaaji main dhaval kulkarni ne shanivaar ko jis str kaa pradarshan kiya, usase mumbai indiens ke ranneetikaron ko kaaphi bal mila hoga
 This team is looking very balanced at the moment and this is proved by the 58-run win over Royal Challengers
 ab dekhnaa rochak hoga ki gilcrist kii sena vankhede kaa kila bhed paati he yaa nahin, kyonki ab tak khele gaye aath maichon main se chaar jeetne vaali is team ko agali jeet ausat se acchhee team ke darje main laa sakati he

 On the other hand, every player of Mumbai Indians played an important role in victory against Royal Challengers and this makes this team extremely dangerous

 ) Salim Khan, father of Salman Khan, said on Saturday that a school should be built on five acres of land given to Muslims in Ayodhya Verdict
 ayodhya par aae supreme court (supreme Court On Ayodhya Case) ke faisle par saleem khan (83) ne kaha ki bharat ke musalamaanon ko masjid nahin, skool kii jarurat he
 Welcoming the Supreme Court's historic verdict on the Ayodhya case, the father of three Bollywood actors Salman, Sohail and Arbaaz said that the Prophet has revealed two features of Islam, including love and forgiveness
 ab jab is kahani (ayodhya vivaad) kaa da and ho gaya he to muslimon ko in do visheshtaon par chalakar aage badhanaa chahie
 'show love and forgive
 ' ab is mudde ko phir se mat kurediye
 
 yahaan se aage badhie
 Salim Khan has made this appeal to the Muslim community
 bhartiya samaaj ke paripakv hone kii baat karte hue saleem khan (salim Khan) ne ieenes se kaha, "faisla aane ke baad jis tareeke se shanti or sauhardra kaayam rahi yah prashansaneey he
 Now accept it
 
 An old controversy came to an end
 main tah-e-dil se is faisle kaa swaagat karata hum
 Muslims should not discuss it now (ayodhya dispute)
 isaki jagah unako buniyadi samasyaon kii charchaa kerani chahie or use hal karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 i am making such a discussion because we need a school and a hospital
 ayodhya main masjid ke liye milane vaali paanch acre jagah par college bane to behatar hoga
 "salim Khan said," We do not need a mosque, we will offer prayers anywhere
 
 Will read anywhere in the train, on the ground in the plane
 lekin hamen behatar skool kii jarurat he
 22 crore Muslims will get good training, so many shortcomings of this country will be eradicated
 " baliwood main kai blocbster filmein or iskaa formula dene vaale film lekhak ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi shanti par jor dete hai
 He said, "I agree with the Prime Minister
 aaj hamen shanti kii jarurat he
 We need peace to focus on our purpose
 hamen apane bhavishya par sochane kii jarurat he
 We should know that there is a better future in an educated society
 mukhya mudda yah he ki muslim talim main pichde hai
 So i repeat that let us call this (ayodhya dispute) the end and make a fresh start

 The month of June has started, but till now there has not been even procurement (government procurement) of wheat from the farmers in seven districts of Bihar
 gehun kii kharid nahin hone ke kaaran bichauliye oune-paune bhav main gehun kharid le ja rahe hai
 Wheat is to be purchased by June 30 in the state
 vaise jahaan kharid hui he yaa ho rahi he, vahaan bhi raftaar kaaphi dhimi he
 According to the data of the Cooperative Department, about 2700 tonnes of wheat have been procured in Bihar so far, against the target of two lakh tonnes
 aurangabad jile ke amba ke kisaan shyaam ji pandeya kehete hai ki gehun kii kheti to is saal bade utsaah se kii thi or is kheti ke bharose hi kai sapane bhi sanjoe the
 But as of now, procurement has not started, they are selling wheat for a quarter of a price to do the next farming, repay the debt of the Mahajans and fulfill their other needs
 yahi haal kai kisaanon ke bhi hai
 On the condition of anonymity, an official of the Cooperative Department said that seven of the 38 districts of Bihar - Vaishali, Saran, Sheikhpura, Katihar, Madhubani, Aurangabad and Jamui - have not yet started procuring wheat
 unhone bataaya ki is varsh ek april se gehun kii kharid shuru kii jaani thi, magar loksabhaa chunaav ke kaaran shuru nahin ho saki thi, pichley ek pakhwaade se kharid shuru kii gai he
 Additional Chief Secretary of Cooperative Department Atul Prasad also believes that there has been a delay in wheat procurement due to elections, but now it has gained momentum
 unhone daawa kiya ki sarkaar nishchit lakshya kii prapti kar legaa
 Sources say that the main reason for not starting the procurement of wheat in these districts is not the location in the godown
 sutron kaa daawa he ki packs or vyapaar mandal gehun kharidne se isiilie batch rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that earlier the wheat used to be procured here by the trade board, but for the first time, the cooperative department is also procuring wheat this year through Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)
 haalanki aise packson ko isamen shaamil nahin kiya gaya he, jo pehle se difolter hon yaa ve janvitaran pranali kii dukaan sanchalit kar rahe hai
 An official of the department said that so far more than 1500 committees have been selected for wheat procurement
 sabase zyada samitiyon kaa chayan madhubani jile main hua he, jabaki patna main gehun kii kharid main 135 se zyada samitiyaan juty hui hai
 The Department of Cooperatives claims that most wheat has been procured so far in Supaul
 bihar ke sahakaarita mantri rana randhir singh ne phone par bataaya ki kuch hi din purv sabhi adhikariyon kii baithak kar gehun kharid main teji laane kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 He said that wheat procurement is being monitored daily
 unhone daawa kiya ki is maheene tak lakshya ke mutabik, gehun kii kharid kar lee jaaegi

 With the election of Ranbheri ringing in Jharkhand, all political parties have stepped up the search for political 'warriors' for the war
 abhi tak jo sthiti ubhari he, usamen yah mana ja rahaa he ki rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) or vipakshi dalon ke mahagathbandhan ke bich aamane-saamne kii ladaai hogi,lekin donon gathbandhan siton kii daavedaari se pareshaan he
 All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU), the ally of the ruling BJP, has also claimed the 'double digit', putting the BJP in the 'vortex' before the election
 bhaajapa ke sutron kii maane to bhaajapa pichley vidhansabha kii tarj par seat bantwaaraa chaahati he, jise ajasu ne sidhe taur nakaar diya he
 The leader of AJSU says that a lot has changed in the last five years
 ajasu ke adhyaksh sudesh mahato kehete hai ki 2014 main sthir sarkaar dene ke liye ajasu ne badi qurbaani di thi
 This time, you will have to talk to the BJP about the seats
 unhone kaha ki is baar seat bantwaare ko lekar pradesh bhaajapa ke netaaon ke saath unka manthan jari he
 However, he also said that the matter has not been reached yet, now there is to be a talk with Delhi about seat sharing
 is bich bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmana gilua ne kaha ki bhaajapa pichley chunaav kii tarj par 72 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Significantly, the screw in the BJP and AJSU is more stuck after the mlas of many other parties join the BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki lohardaga, sisai, chandanakyari, tundi, hatiya, mandu jaisi kai siten hai, jahaan donon dalon kii daavedaari he
 In such a situation, the situation is stuck
 ajasu sutron kaa daawa he ki party vidhansabha kii 12 se 15 siton par daavedaari kii he
 The party may also propose a 'post poll alliance' with the BJP
 haal ke dinon main bhaajapa ne duusare dalon ke vidhayakon ko jis tarah apane paale main kiya he, usase ajasu khud ko asahaj mahasoos karne laga he
 Among the legislators of the opposition who have joined the BJP, AJSU has a strong claim to at least two seats
 lohardaga vidhansabha kshetra main pichley chunaav main ajasu ke camel kishor bhagat ne sukhdev bhagat ko haraaya tha
 However, Kamal Kishore's membership was withdrawn after the court sentenced him and by-elections were held in Lohardaga
 usamen sukhdev bhagat jite the
 Now Sukhdev Bhagat has moved to BJP, while AJSU considers it his seat
 maaloom ho ki mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or unke chachaa varisht kaabina mantri amar singh ke bich haal main hui uthapatak ke liye mukhyamantri or party mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne paroksh rup se amar singh ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 Akhilesh had said that the entire quarrel was caused by an 'outsider'
 agar ab unke or netaji (mulaayam) ke bich koi bahari vyakti aayaa to use baahar kar diya jayega
 He had also pointed to Amar Singh as an outsider on several forums
 ghatnakram ke dauraan ek baar to aisa laga ki sapa mukhiya parivaar main tej hoti raar ko rokane ke liye amar singh ko party se nikaal denge
 Amar Singh has also been the General Secretary of the SP in the past
 unhen varsh 2010 main party virdohi gatividhiyon ke aarope main sapa se nikaal diya gaya tha
 During the recent Rajya Sabha elections, he reached the upper house on the ticket of SP for the second consecutive time
 tippaniyan Senior SP leaders Azam Khan and Ram Gopal Yadav are said to be the strongest opponents of Amar Singh and have been outspokenly opposed to him many times
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) akhilesh ne kaha tha ki sara jhagada ek ‘bahari’ vyakti kii vajah se hua he
 If any outsider comes between him and Netaji (mulayam), he will be thrown out
 unhone kai manchon par bahari vyakti ke taur par amar singh kii ore ishaara bhi kiya tha
 During the course of events, it seemed that the SP chief would expel Amar Singh from the party to stop the intensifying rage in the family
 amar singh purv main bhi sapa ke mahasachiv rah chuke hai
 He was expelled from the SP in 2010 on charges of anti-party activities
 haal main hue rajyasabha ke chunaav ke vakt vah lagaataar duusari baar sapa ke tikat par ucch sadan main pahunche the

 Prabhu Rai, the security guard of the JDU candidate, was detained for a day on the orders of Election Observer Manish Saxena for allegedly influencing voters at the polling station located at Pakdidayal Middle School in Madhuban assembly constituency here

 naarad raay, mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav ke kareebi the

 dilli main vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar ection mod main bijepisansadon ko mil sakati he chunavi kaman kii jimmedaarisiem chehre par chunaav ke baad hi party karegi faisladilli main vidhansabha chunaav behad najadik hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants to win the election at any cost this time, away from 21 years in the assembly elections 2020
 congress kii hi tarah bijepi bhi andruni kalah kaa shikaar he
 There is also a challenge for the top party leadership, from the opinions of party workers to the face of the Chief Minister and to end factionalism within the party
 bijepi dilli main bhi jeet hasil karne ke liye koi kor-kasar nahin chhodana chaahati he
 The BJP is working on a different strategy to win the election
 sutron ke mutabik party is baar saansadon ko maidan main utaarne par vichaar kar rahi he, jisamen rajyasabha se saansad or dilli bijepi ke senior netaa vijay goyal kaa naam bhi saamne aa rahaa he
 Vijay Goyal's Rajya Sabha term ends next year
 vahiin purvi dilli se purv saansad mahesh giri ko bhi utaarne par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 While the word contender is being used for Delhi BJP mps
 daramil sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, party saansadon ke bich aapasi khinchataan ho yaa phir siem pad ko lekar daavedaari kaa sawaal, iske liye party dilli bijepi ke saansadon se daavedaari ko lekar vidhansabha chunaav ladane ko kah sakati he
 Any MP who considers himself a contender for the post of CM can be asked to contest the assembly elections
 philhal dilli bijepi ke saansadon se chunaav ladane ko nahin kaha gaya he lekin unki koi daavedaari saamne aati he to phir unako bhi vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladane ko kaha ja saktaa he
 According to sources, the party feels that by doing this, the conflict between the MP and CM posts before the Delhi Assembly elections will also be reduced and everyone will work together to win the election
 chunaav jeetne baad party alaakaman tay karegi ki aakhir koun banegaa siem
 Since mps do not even have to resign from the post of MP to contest assembly elections, because they get 6 months
 vaise to har saansad ke apane sansadeey kshetra main 10 vidhansabha kshetra aate hai jisamen har saansad ko apane apane kshetron main party ko jeet dilaane kii jimmedaari saunp di gai he
 In fact, the party's leaders also believe that whenever the CM has come out with a face in the Delhi Assembly elections, the party has lost and once even got a chance but could not get a majority, so the CM should go without face
 vahiin dilli bijepi main party kaaryakarta modi ke chehre par chunaav ladane kaa suzav de chuke hai lekin 2024 ke party taiyaariyon ko dekhte hue pradhanmantri modi ko cheharaa bananaa he yaa nahin, isapar bhi faisla party alaakaman ko karnaa he
 The party wants to field with lotus scars and some big faces
 chunaav jeetne baad koun banegaa mukhyamantri, is par party alaakaman hi faisla karegaa
 At the moment no one is willing to speak on this issue
 saansadon ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne iskaa khandan kiya or kaha, mujhe isaki jaankaree nahin he
