 ) nae raksha mantri manohar parrikar apni saadagi or saaf bol ke liye jane jate hai
 There is no trick or trick in his talk
 ajtak ke agenda 2014 kaarykram main unhone saadagi se apni baat rakhi or sarkaar kii niti kii ek jhalak bhi dikhaai
 He made it clear that he wanted to show something
 desh kii raksha ke prati vah samvedansheel hai or isamen koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahate hai
 He also said that the antics of Pakistan will be answered well, but we have to find a solution
 yani vah chaahate hai ki ek ore to bharat pakistan ko uski galat harkaton ke liye kadaa jabaav to detaa rahe, saath hi dirghashanti ke liye raste bhi dhundhata rahe
 This is worth addressing because every sensible person knows that a gun can be answered with a gun, but this policy between two neighbors may not always be effective

 It is a great thing for the Defense Minister to understand the needs of the soldiers of the country and to have a sense of doing something for them
 amuman raksha mantri hathiyaaron or gola-barood kii baat to karte hai lekin unki praathmik suvidhaon masalan juute vagairah kii baaten nahin karte
 When Pakistan invaded and captured many places in Siachen, it was revealed that our soldiers have neither warm clothes nor shoes to fight at that height
 yah bahut niraashajanak tha or us kaaran hamaare jabanj javaanon ko bahut pareshaani uthaani padi thi
 But the current defense minister seems sensitive in this matter
 unhen lagata he ki hamaare sainikon ke paas gola-barood or upkarnon kii baari kami he, jise puraa kiya janaa jaruri he lekin saath hi saath unki buniyadi jaruraton kii upeksha nahin kii ja sakati he
 His assertion that legalization should be provided to agents engaged in the deal of defense goods
 isse saudon main paardarshita aegi or kickbac ke aarope bhi nahin lagenge
 More than that, the purchase of weapons will not last for years
 manohar parrikar kii ek or baat acchhee lagati he ki unhen apni yogyata yaa degree ke bare main koi gumaan nahin he
 This is a big thing in today's context because usually people occupying big positions get very anxious about their qualifications or degrees
 raksha saudon or hathiyaaron ke utpaadan ke bare main unka bayaan sahi he
 They know that there can be no hurry in them
 ve chaahate hai ki jo kuch bhi kharida jaae vah behatar ho or jarurat kaa ho
 We can expect that during the tenure of Manohar Parrikar, there will be a drastic change in the Defense Ministry of the country as the thinking has changed here

 Many people are also linking Kasganj with Kashmir
 is baat par upi sarkaar ke mantri surya pratap shahi ne kaha- 'log kasganj kii tulana kashmir se kar rahe hai
 i say this is a big matter, but it should not be compared with Kashmir
 'surya pratap shahi ne aage kaha, 'doshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 No one is allowed to participate in such incidents
 ye mahatvapurn mudda he or sarkaar kaarywahi kar rahi he
 'kasganj violence was told small incident, before this, Surya Pratap Shahi had described Kasganj incident as a' small incident '
 unhone kaha tha, 'galat he or kisi maamle ko anaavashyak tool dena bhi sahi nahin he
 a small incident occurred in which an accident occurred with two people
 'unhone kaha tha, 'sarkaar uske bare main gambhir he or kaarywahi kar rahi he
 The atmosphere of the state should not be spoiled by comparing it with Kashmir
 'kab or kyon hui hinsa?26 janvari ko kasganj main do samudayon ke bich jhadap hui, jisamen ek yuvak chandan gupta ko goli lagi or uski maut ho gai
 After this, violence erupted in Kasganj

 Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh, Justice NK Mehrotra, while advocating to bring the Prime Minister and Chief Minister under the purview of Lokpal, said that corruption with Lokpal alone will not reduce
 nyaayamurti mehrotra ne kaha ki pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main laayaa janaa chaiye
 At the same time, the Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh should be given broad powers like Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh
 haalanki unhone kaha ki akele lokapal se bhrashtachar par lagaam nahin lagegi lekin isse maahaul zarur bana he jo ek acchhee baat he
 Mehrotra said that there is open corruption in the field of education, so higher education, village head and aided educational institutions should also come under the Lokayukta probe

 Admission and examination are going on with the bribe, what will be the future of the children in such a situation
 lokayukta ne kaha ki jab tak anudaan vaali shikshan sansthaaen or ucch shiksha lokayukta jaanch daayre shaamil nahin hogi tab tak bhrashtachar charam par hi rahegaa
 He said that the State Home Secretary Fateh Bahadur and Director General of Police have also been facing serious charges

 ikbaal kaskar nagpada kii dambaravaala building ke sabase upar sthit apane chaar kamaron vaale apartment se saat kimi dur croford bazaar main police mukhyalay ko dekh saktaa he
 It is a constant reminder of how close the law is
 or kitna shaktiheen bhi jo 46 varshiya ikbaal ko giraftaar nahin kar saktaa
 Police tried to arrest Dawood Ibrahim's younger brother at least twice after being sent to India from Dubai in 2003, but failed
 pehali baar use 2007 main croford bazaar main sthit sara-sahaara (jiskaa sahaara group se koi vaasta nahin he) shopping malls ke maamle main giraftaar karne kii koshish kii gai
 Police say Iqbal hatched a conspiracy with Dawood and Chhota Shakeel to build malls on the land reserved for the Palika school
 unhone brihannmumbai mahanagarapalika ke adhikariyon se bhi sathganth kar lee thi
 The sessions court acquitted Iqbal in June 2007 for lack of evidence
 doosraa maamla november, 2011 main aadhi raat kii aag kaa he jisamen sara-sahaara malls puri tarah jal gaya or manish market ke kuch hisson ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 The police got a sense of conspiracy in this
 use ashanka thi ki 200 karod ru
 This land of value was evacuated and set on fire for its redevelopment
 lekin pramukh sandigdh ikbaal kaskar par shikanja kasne ke liye ek baar phir koi saboot nahin mila
 However, there is a lot of evidence to clamp down on Dawood as the main conspirator in the serial bomb blasts in Mumbai on March 12, 1993
 un dhamaakon main 260 se zyada log maare gaye the
 Pakistan denies that Dawood is in Karachi
 daaud kabhi 'bhai' or 'muchhad' ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 But for the last five years he has been called Boss
 daaud ke bos hone kaa arth yah he ki ab vah vaid kaarobaari ban gaya he
 According to an estimate, his business was Rs 75,000 crore
 kaa he or usne jahajrani tathaa airlines sahit kai tarah ke vyavsaay main nivesh kiya he
 His business interests span Asia, Europe and Africa

 But the longer its shadow is on Nagpada, the more it appears nowhere else
 yah shahari basti chaar manjali imaaraton se bhari hui he
 This is where the son of a police head constable in Ratnagiri district ventured into criminality and became an 'infamous international terrorist' in the eyes of the US in 2003

 pratidwandvi chota rajan giroh ke bandookdhaariyon ne 17 may, 2011 ko is garh main send lagaakar ikbaal ke driver aarif saiyad abu bookhaa ko goli maar di thi
 Iqbal now lives in his home and watches Hollywood action movies and reality TV shows
 jab use kabhi baahar nikalnaa padataa he to vah kurta-pyjama pahanakar pichley daravaaje se baahar aata he or taxi ko ishaara karata he
 Iqbal has maintained the Kaskar family's love for Bollywood
 gangster se film nirmaataa bane ek vyakti ke jariye uske sambandh film jagat se hai
 Two of Bollywood's biggest stars still keep in touch with him and use predetermined nicknames like 'salim' to identify themselves
 mana jaataa he ki ikbaal ne madhya mumbai ke irdagird ke ilaakon ke atirikt mira road or bhayandar jaise upnagaron main bhi real estate main nivesh kiya he
 Iqbal's brother-in-law, 43-year-old Zanzeb Khan alias Guddu Pathan, is believed to handle Dawood's real estate business
 police ke ek mubir kaa kahana he, ''daaud ke paise ko janjeb apane vaid real estate kaarobaar main nivesh karata he
 He does not let Iqbal come into the discussion
 '' divangat kareem lala ke pote janjeb kii saali rijwaana ikbaal se byaahi he
 An inspector of Nagpada police station confirms that Dawood has invested a hefty amount in slum rehabilitation projects in Andheri and Jogeshwari areas of Mumbai

 In September 1992, 24 gangsters of d Company forcibly entered the hospital and rode Haldankar with AK-47

 This sensational shootout was the beginning of a fight between gangs in the 1990s
 1993 ke dhamaake ke baad kii alpavadhi ko chhod den to 1990 ke dashakabar ladaai jari rahi
 Members of the Gawli, Amar Naik, Abu Salem and Chhota Rajan gangs fought several times for strength, influence and a stake in the fast-growing real estate and film businesses

 She used to hold a court in her flat on the first floor of Nagpada Gordon Hall

 dakshin-purv asia main rahane vaala rajan ab bhi har saal use raakhi bhejtaa he
 But the shadow of death still hovers over Hasina

 After Iqbal was released from prison, Hasina came on the radar of the police
 april, 2007 main ek builder vinod avalani ne police main shikaayat kii ki jameen kaa ek sauda paravaan na chadhane par vah use dhamkee de rahi he
 The police registered a case against Hasina

 She subsists on the money she receives from her tenants

 While Hasina and Iqbal are taking advantage of the Dawood family surname, 34-year-old Zubair Khan feels uneasy with him
 unhone 2005 main hasina kii beti sanaa se shaadi kii
 Zubair's first film from TV journalist-turned-filmmaker Lakir Ke Faqir is about to be released

 kesavani kaa daawa he ki bhai-bahan donon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he kyonki police daaud ko nahin pakad sakati
 He says, "dawood is not immaculate but why did the police not find evidence against him?" Senior officials of the crime branch say that Dawood's extradition has now become a political matter which does not come under the purview of Mumbai Police
 ikbaal ke dost or ek anya chote vyavsaayee kaa daawa he ki police ankhen moond leti he
 He says, "the police told us: do anything, but there should be no shooting

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said at an event in Delhi that the next important decision that the country has to take is whether people like me should get LPG subsidy
 unhone kaha ki ham jitani jaldi is bare main faisla karenge, utana hi hamaari iconomi ke liye behatar hoga
 Currently, everyone gets 12 subsidized cylinders at the rate of Rs 414 per cylinder annually
 isse zyada silinder kii jarurat hone par prati silinder 880 rupee dene padate hai
 But now the government is eyeing those who are financially capable and can buy cylinders without subsidy
 ab aarthik aadhaar par sabsidi kaa nirdhaaran kiya jayega
 Jaitley said in the program that the country has now recovered from policy paralysis
 ab centre main faisla lene vaali sarkaar he
 We are trying our best, the public is also responsible and they should also contribute
 gauratlab he ki narendra modi sarkaar ne un logon se jo aarthik rup se samarth hai, kooking gas silinder par di jane vaali sabsidi ko svaichhik rup se chhodane kii guzarish kii thi
 However, only 0 out of a customer base with 150 million connections
 006 fisadi logon ne hi is par amal kiya he
 Three months ago the government asked people to give up subsidy on their gas cylinders and so far only 8,868 people or units have voluntarily given up subsidy
 logon kii dariyaadilii par bharosa karke sarkaar ne dekh liya ab aap apana ji kadaa kar len kyonki agar aapkaa batua baari he to sarkaar aapako sabsidi dene main apni jeb dhili nahin karegi

 The Supreme Court, while hearing the Uttar Pradesh government's petition against the Allahabad High Court's decision, has sent a notice to Surendra Koli and the Central Government seeking an answer
 hycourt ne dayaa yachika par faisla karne main ‘atyadhik deree’ ke aadhaar par isi saal 2006 ke nithari maamle ke doshi surendra coli kii maut kii sajaa ghataakar aaajeevan karawas main tabdeel kar diya tha
 During the hearing in the Supreme Court, the central government supported the UP government and said that Koli should be hanged
 is maamle main hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf centre sarkaar bhi yachika daakhil karegi
 The UP government said in the Supreme Court that it took three years to decide Koli and it cannot be called excessive delay
 tippaniyan Hence the High Court's decision should be quashed
 isse pehle hoicourt ne apane nirnay main kaha tha ki coli kii dayaa yachika par faisle main ‘atyadhik deree ko dekhte hue’ uski maut kii sajaa par amal ‘asanvaidhanik’ hoga
 The court gave the ruling on a PIL filed by the NGO 'people's Union for Democratic Rights' (PUDR)
 is sanghathan ne daleel di thi ki coli kii dayaa yachika ke nibatare main ‘teen saal or teen maheene’ kaa samay laga or aisi sthiti main uski maut kii sajaa par amal samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 main die gaye jivan jeene ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan hoga
 Later, Koli himself filed a petition challenging the death penalty on the basis of this PIL and both these petitions were filed
 supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne upi sarkaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki coli ko faansee di jaani chahie
 The Central Government will also file a petition against the High Court's decision in this matter
 upi sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha ki coli kaa faisla karne main teen saal kaa vakt laga or ise atyadhik deree nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The comments isliye hoicourt ke faisle ko radd kiya janaa chahie
 Earlier, the High Court had said in its judgment that execution of Koli's death sentence would be 'unconstitutional' in view of the 'excessive delay' in deciding the mercy petition
 adaalat ne gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ‘pipuls union for democratic ritis’ (piudiar) kii janhit yachika par yah faisla sunaaya tha
 This organization had argued that it took 'three years and three months' to settle Koli's mercy petition and in such a situation, execution of his death sentence would violate the right to live life given in Article 21 of the Constitution
 baad main coli ne khud bhi ek yachika daayar karke is janhit yachika main die gaye aadhaar par hi maut kii sajaa ko chunauti di thi or is donon yachikaaon ko natthi kar diya gaya tha
 Hence the High Court's decision should be quashed
 isse pehle hoicourt ne apane nirnay main kaha tha ki coli kii dayaa yachika par faisle main ‘atyadhik deree ko dekhte hue’ uski maut kii sajaa par amal ‘asanvaidhanik’ hoga

 is sanghathan ne daleel di thi ki coli kii dayaa yachika ke nibatare main ‘teen saal or teen maheene’ kaa samay laga or aisi sthiti main uski maut kii sajaa par amal samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 main die gaye jivan jeene ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan hoga
 Later, Koli himself filed a petition challenging the death penalty on the basis of this PIL and both these petitions were filed

 Parents who wish to enroll their children in renowned schools will have to wait
 darasal nursery daakhile main nebarhud ke chaatro ko daakhila dene kii anirvaayta vaale dilli sarkaar ke faisle se privet skool naakhush he
 The situation is that in the absence of guideline, admission in private schools built on DDA land is expected to start late
 daakhile main ho rahi deree ke liye skool dilli sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai to vahin dilli sarkaar is deree kii vajah alji kaa istipha bataa rahi he
 Delhi: Another school will be installed in NDMC schools soon
 iske baavjood bhi bachche ko skool main daakhila mil jaayegaa is baat kii koi guarantee nahin
 Therefore, parents apply in not one but 20 to 25 schools, but due to the new rules that the Delhi government is preparing to bring for the schools built on the land of DDA, parents will also have a lack of options
 nijee or sarkari jameen par bane skulon main daakhile ke niyam alag-alag hone se abhibhavakon kii dikkatein to badhegi hi lekin spasht guideline ke abhaav main ab skool ye nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki daakhile ke liye koun se formula par kaam karen
 IIT Gandhinagar will be built in Indian Army Research Center
 If schools are to be considered, then the delay will come in the guidelines
 
 
 daakhile main bhi utani hi deree hogi
 In fact, when leasing land from DDA, it was said that schools should give priority to the children of the area for admission
 alcon international skool ke principal ashok pandeya ke mutabik skool pehle se hi daakhile main nebarhud criteria ko tavajjo dete rahe hai lekin agar sibling, elumanai jaise duusare criteria ko puri tarah nazarandaaj kar diya gaya to skool or abhibhavak donon kii mushkilen bad jaaengi
 Nursery Admission: The National Progressive School Conference has approached the court to resolve the screw of admission schedules issued by the doe
 maamle kii sunwaayee 30 janvari ko he
 But meanwhile, from January 2, about 1400 schools in the capital, which are built on private land, will start admission
 
 Whereas 285 private schools built on government land, including big schools like Vasant Valley, Bal Bharti, Alcon International, Mother's Global, The Shriram, GD Goenka School, Heritage School, Hillwood School, Universal School, private admission process hangs in the balance Will remain baharhaal, didie kii jameen par bane skulon ke liye guideline kab aaengi, na sarkaar ko pataa he na skulon ko
 The case has been embroiled in a legal bet
 itnaa tay he ki is baar bhi nursery daakhile kii prakriya main deree hogi

 On Javed Miandad's remarks against India, BCCI President Anurag Thakur said on Tuesday that this former cricket captain of Pakistan is still in shock from his country's record of defeat and victory on the field of battle and cricket
 niyantran rekha ke paar bharat ke lakshith hamale (sargical strike) ke baad miyandad ne kaha tha ki pakistan bharat ke khilaaf jang ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar he
 BJP MP and BCCI chief Thakur said, "pakistan has not yet recovered from the shock suffered by India in the 1965, 1971 and Kargil battles
 miyandad ke saath bhi aisa hi he jo vishwa cap itihaas main ek baar bhi bharat ko nahin haraa paane se sadame main he
 If needed, India is ready to blow Pakistan once again, whether it is a battle ground or a cricket ground
 ’miyandad par nishaanaa sadhate hue thakur ne kaha ki is purv captain ko apane rishtedaaron or anderworld don daaud ibrahim se baahar nikalne ke liye kahana chahie
 The comments thakur ne kaha, ‘miyandad agar apane logon ko lekar itnaa aashwast he to use daaud ko bharat waapas aane ke liye kahana chahie
 Why doesn't he do this? hamane hameshaa pakistan ko haraaya he or bhavishya main dobaaraa aisa karenge
 The BCCI chief has already refused to resume the cricketing relationship with Pakistan under the current circumstances

 It is the same with Miandad who is shocked to not be able to beat India even once in World Cup history
 agar jarurat padi to bharat ek baar phir pakistan ko dhul chataane ko taiyaar he, phir chaahe ladaai kaa maidan ho yaa cricket kaa maidan
 Targeting Miandad, Thakur said that this former captain should ask his relatives and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim to get out
 tippaniyan Thakur said, 'if Miandad is so confident about his people, then he should ask Dawood to come back to India
 vah aisa kyon nahin karata
 We have always defeated Pakistan and will do so again in future
 ’ bisisiai pramukh pehle hi maujuuda halaat main pakistan ke saath cricket sambandh dobaaraa shuru karne se inkaar kar chuke hai

 Today, on the day of Shri Krishna Janmashtami, we have spoken to Shri Krishna 'nitish Bhardwaj' of Reel Life
 unhone haal hi main film 'mohenjo daaro' main kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 Here is the excerpt from the conversation with him: Whenever there is mention of Lord Krishna, your face comes in front of people? God has mercy, Mother Bhagwati is pleased that we got such an opportunity to work with that team
 Who were veterans of their respective fields
 main 'mahabharat' ke saxes kaa shrey in sabko detaa hum
 Even after 25 years, people have not forgotten it
 jab 'mahabharat' ke dauraan aapako kaha gaya ki parde par 'shri krishna' kaa kirdaar nibhaana he, to us samay aapke jahan main kya chal rahaa tha?maine 'shri krishna' se related koi bhi film nahin dekhi
 At that time, people in Maharashtra knew 'sahu Modak' Sahib as 'shri Krishna' because he used to play his role many times
 maine inaki filmein nahin dekhi
 Then after studying Marathi literature, reading a lot of books, reading 18 volumes of Mahabharata, he went on shooting
 meri sahitya kii ruchi iske liye kaam ai
 Also read books like 'yuganta' and 'dhyasaparva'
 bahut taiyaari karata tha
 Marathi literature created a 'sri Krishna' within me
 'mohenjo daaro' main bhi aapane kaam kiya?haa, meraa kaam 'durjan' ke rup main tha jo rithik roshan ke kirdaar ko paal pos ke bada karata he
 Nice to work with aajkal aap kam filmein kar rahe hai?main thodaa sa alag-alag kaamon main vyast ho gaya tha
 Was working for the development of tourism in Madhya Pradesh
 photography, kitaab likhnaa, naatak karne jaise kaamon main vyast tha
 Also, in the last 3-4 months, my Marathi film went out, whose name was 'pitra loan'
 to yahi sab kaaran the or projects na karne ke
 We have done another film 'yaksha' and have been working on my next project for the last few months which will be a biopic
 to bhagwaan vaale role ab nahin karenge?project aayega to karuunga, lekin abhi to bhagwaan vaale imoshans kii jagah human imoshan ko parde par nibhaane kaa samay aa gaya he
 And that's why I'm doing some different projects
 ab main filmein bahut zyada karuunga
 How do you look so young even today? i have kept my lifestyle very simple and comfortable
 cigarette, sharaab or nonvej kaa seven nahin karata hum
 Swimming, tennis and walk
 ek samay khaataa hum, usamen bhi fruit zyada khaataa hum
 But my only weakness is snacks and pakoras
 itnaa hi nahin, ayurvedic aushadhiyaan hi letaa hum
 What kind of scripts would you like to do now? Harscript who challenges me as an actor
 haal hi main 'aalia bhatta' ke fadar kaa kirdaar aayaa tha, lekin wo chalanging nahin tha, to maine karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 Performance is a must
 logon ne mujhe kamedi karte hue parde par nahin dekha he lekin aapako pataa he ki krishna ke role main bhi natkhtapan tha
 That's why i got that role
 main kamedi film karnaa chahta hum
 Do you protect yourself from rhetoric on religious issues? i believe that it is not necessary for everyone to speak in everything
 kuch mudde media main bolne se hal nahin hote, bas thodi publicity mil jaati he
 If i have to speak on any religious issue, then i write a letter to the person related to it
 main thodaa sanyamit tarah kaa vyakti hum
 Watch movies? i liked many films
 'dam lagaake haisha', 'madari', 'kapur and sans' or salmaan khan kii donon filmein 'bajrangi bhaijan' or 'sultan' acchhee lagi
 i feel very good that Salman is choosing very good scripts now
 main industry kaa insaan hum or khabar rakhana jaruri he
 Is the era of biopic? i would definitely like to do biopic as an actor
 lekin philhal main period film par kaam kar rahaa hum
 Want to get into politics again? Not for the next fifty years because i learned that what i wanted to do through politics, i can do it through films too
 or filmon kii popularity ke saath samaaj ke hit main kaam karnaa chaahunga
 Every person tells me that you don't go into politics
 ab main cinema main hi rahoonga
 BJP President Amit Shah arrived in Manipur on Saturday after traveling to West Bengal for the Mission 2019
 shah imphal ke hotel clasik grand main party ke netaaon ke saath baithak kii
 It is being told that the meeting has discussed with the BJP leaders of all the seven states of the Northeast for the next general elections
 bijepi ne pashchim bengal ke baad ab purvottar par focus karnaa shuru kiya he
 The saffron party wants to win more than 20 seats in this part of the country
 baithak main kendriya grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju, manipur ke mukhyamantri en
 Biren Singh, Tripura CM Biplab Deb, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Khandu, BJP leader Hemant Vishwasharma were present
 saath hi ram madhav bhi baithak main shirkat kar rahe hai
 Shah will also hold meetings with BJP state presidents from seven states in the northeast
 yah baithak raat chal sakati he
 manipurbjp is preparing to welcome Amit Shah strongly, where a meeting is scheduled to meet all the Chief Ministers of the Northeast and all the leaders of the party
 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke maddenjar purvottar kii sansadeey samiti kii baithak main chunavi ranneeti par charchaa kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 Significantly, most of the northeastern states have won the assembly elections held in the last two years
 ababijepiyaha loksabhaa chunaavon main paracham lahraane par apana dhyaan kendrit kar rahi he
 BJP first established power in Assam
 iske baad usne arunachal pradesh, manipur, nagaland, tripura or meghalaya main sarkaar banane main kamyaabi hasil kii
 It is a different matter that the BJP formed the government on its own and the support of others
 bijepi ab apana dhyaan mizoram par kendrit kar rahi he, jo iklauta isai bahul rajya he jahaan bijepi kaa shashan nahin he
 The saffron party is working aggressively in the northeast for the Lok Sabha elections so that it can compensate the electoral losses in any part of the country from this region
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or tiemasi pramukh mamata banerjee dilli daure par hai or yahaan vah tisare morche ke gathan kii kavayad main juty hui hai
 In this episode, Mamta also met the leaders of various parties on Tuesday
 mamata na sirf vipakshi dalon ke netaaon se milin balki congress or bijepi ke bhi kuch netaaon se mamata kii mulaakaat tay he
 In the next Lok Sabha election, Mamata Banerjee has spoken of forming a Federal Front to confront BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in the wake of these efforts, Mamata has met leaders of NCP, Shiv Sena, TRS, TDP, RJD and SP
 lekin in mulakaaton kaa kya asar aagaamee chunaav par padegaa is baat kovibhinn dalon kii sthitise samajha ja saktaa he
 The idea of a TRS-TMC alliancefederal Front first came to light on March 19 during a conversation between Mamata Banerjee and TRS chief k Chandrasekhar Rao
 tiares pramukh or telugana ke mukhyamantri ne mamata ke samaksh aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ko dur rakhkar fedral front khadaa kiye jane kii baat kahi thi
 In such a situation, TRS and TMC can come on one platform for 2019
 NCP ke saath par suspencemamta ne dilli main ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se mulaakaat kii
 After separating from the UPA, the NCP has contested assembly elections against the Congress in several states
 aise main mumkin he ki 2019 ke chunaav main mamata or sharad pavaar kii party bijepi or congress donon khemon ke khilaaf ek saath aae
 TDP MP and former Union Minister YS Chaudhary have also met Mamata Banerjee
 endie kaa hissaa rahi tidipi andhra ke liye vishesh darje kii maang ko lekar sarkaar se samarthan waapas le chuki he or lagaataar sadan main sarkaar ke khilaaf hallabol rahi he
 This federal front can benefit from tdp's displeasure with BJP because TDP has been blaming Congress for more Andhra division than BJP
 donon khemon se naaraaz tidipi bhi tisare morche ke saath ja sakati he
 Shiv Sena, which has been involved in the rebellious surnda government of Shiv Sena, is continuously attacking the Modi government but it is less likely to contest elections against BJP
 aaj dilli main mamata or shivasena saansad sanjay raut ke bich mulaakaat hui
 The party has announced to contest from the NDA in 2019 and contest elections, but the image of Mamata in West Bengal can hardly be shaken by Shiv Sena ideology
 sapa-bispi kaa saathutar pradesh kii raajnneeti main saath aae sapa-basapa kisi bhi sahyogi ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kaaphi hai
 The alliance has shown strength in the last by-election but Akhilesh Yadav's Congress love is also not hidden from anyone
 gaiyr congressi maurche ko sapa kaa saath milegaa, yah thodaa mushkil najar aata he
 Also, if SP does well in UP in the next election, Akhilesh himself can also try to make his camp by not going to any camp
 argedy se banegi baat?argedy saansad misa bharti ne bhi mamata banerjee se mulaakaat kii he
 Misa's father Lalu Yadav has appealed to Mamata from several forums to come together against the BJP, but the Congress has always been involved in their alliance
 aise main bina congress vaale gathbandhan ko lalu kii party argedy kaa saath milegaa yah mushkil he kyonki bihar main donon dal satta ke sahyogi rah chuke hai
 Mamta Banerjee is involved in the exercise of non-bjp and non-congress front in Delhi, but the equation may change with the coming elections
 saath hi chunaav ke baad bhi nateezon ke aadhaar par bhi saathi khemaa badal bhi sakate hai or kheme main aa bhi sakate hai

 The executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana and party MP Sanjay Raut issued a statement citing his foreign leader who said that the Shiv Sena high command did not approve the half-term loan waiver
 jo bhi ho vah rajya ke sabhi kisaanon ke liye hona chahie
 With this statement, Shiv Sena has tried to obstruct the debt waiver plan of the Maharashtra government
 ravivaar ko andolankaaree kisaan netaaon se baatcheet kar maharashtra sarkaar ne faisla liya he ki, vah chote kisaanon kaa karz turant maaf karti he or baaki kisaanon ke karzmaafi ko tatvatah manjuuri detii he
 Raut has said that such a decision is unwarranted to Uddhav Thackeray
 ve rajya ke sabhi kisaanon kaa karj maaf hote dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Shockingly, the contradiction of the Shiv Sena has come to the fore with this statement
 uddhav thakare ke sapariwaar videsh main hone ke dauraan party ke kai netaa ek hi mudde par uddhav thakare ke hawaale se alag-alag bayaan prasaarit kar rahe hai
 Party spokesperson and Maharashtra Legislative Council member Neelam Go He claimed that the government's decision to free the farmer's bookkeeping, ie debt-free, was welcomed by Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray
 yahi kya kam tha ki shrimati go he ne mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis samet bijepi ke kai anya mantriyon kaa saarvajanik abhinandan bhi kiya
 The comments lekin achraj bhari baat or bhi thi
 The committee, constituted by Chief Minister Fadnavis, has included senior Shiv Sena leader and state transport minister Diwakar Rawate for talks with farmer agitators
 karzmaafi se jude jo bhi faisle hue us prakriya main ravate shaamil the
 In such a situation, the party minister is not talking about the issue on which there is a contradiction in the party
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda karzmaafi se rajya sarkaar kareeb 30 hajaar karod rupee kharch kar 31 lakh kisaanon ko labhanvit karegi
 If the Shiv Sena accepts the stubbornness of the party chief Uddhav Thackeray, the amount of help will reach one lakh 34 thousand crore rupees, which is not practical for any state

 Just a month ago, the private banking sector appeared to be in a better position amid warnings of rising non-performing assets (npas) or sinking debt of public sector banks in India and the hurdle caused by diamond trader Nirav Modi

 On the other hand, private banks were seen as setting high standards of efficiency, customer centric approach and keeping shareholders' interests in mind and earning huge profits

 Due to this continuous deepening crisis, private sector banks are looking as bad as public sector banks
 pehle jise bank main korporate gavarnence ke masale ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha, ab use nijee banking dhaanche main nihit sabase kamjor kadi ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Now the top private banks (ICICI Bank, Axis Bank) are also being compared to the public sector banks and the top officials of private banks have also come under scrutiny of private agencies
 isiisiaai bank maamle main kai pramukh logon ke khilaaf hawaii addon ko nigaraanee (lukout) notice jari kar die gaye hai
 These include Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar, MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, Rajiv Kochhar, Deepak's brother and Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon Group
 isse yah haal ke samay kaa sabase sansanikhej maamla ban gaya he
 There has been increased pressure on the ICICI Bank's board to conduct an independent investigation into the conflict of interest and cases of transactions
 isi vajah se visheshgy phir se yah daleel de rahe hai ki nijeekaran banking kshetra kii sari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 There are 22 public sector banks, 34 private sector banks and 44 foreign banks in the country
 haalanki zyaadaatar rin or agrim (disambar 2017 main 69 fisadi) piesu bainkon ne die hai
 Then comes the number of private sector banks (27 per cent) and foreign banks (4 per cent)
 is samay laanchhan keval isiisiaai bank par hi nahin he
 The Reserve Bank of India has also asked the Board of Axis Bank to reconsider its decision to appoint Shikha Sharma as MD and CEO for a fourth term in view of concerns over rising bad debts in the bank
 bank kshetra ke prekshak pichley ek saal kii kuch anya ghatnaon kaa bhi zikr karte hai jo shikha sharma ke khilaaf gai hongi
 These include a sting by Cobrapost about officials of several private sector banks, including Axis Bank, being involved in money laundering and allegations that some branches of Axis Bank were involved in changing currency for their customers soon after the demonetisation was announced
 Were

 ICICI Bank accounts for the highest number of npas among private sector lenders (rs 44,237 crore as of end-september 2017)
 )
 Then comes the numbers of Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and Jammu & Kashmir Bank

 The rest of the non-executive directors of the bank are Tushar Shah, Dilip Choksi, Amit Aggarwal, Uday Chitale (independent director) and Neelam Dhawan (additional and independent director)
 visheshgyon ko yah baat badi ajeeb lagati he ki kisi bhi nideshak ne pichley do saal main bank main korporate gavarnence kaa masalaa nahin uthaaya
 Experts say that when a board turns a blind eye to a lapse in corporate governance, it is equal to its collusion in this case
 kai bordon main swatantra nideshak ke taur par shaamil udyog kshetra ke ek diggaj ne apana naam na jaahir karne kii shart par kaha, ''isiisiaai bank ke board ko shuru main hi chanda kochar ko clin chit dene kii jaldbaaji nahin kerani chahie thi

 kisi andeh kii chaaya kii bhi puri padtaal honi chahie or yah puri nishpakshta se hona chahie
 Despite public scrutiny in the case of ICICI Bank and scrutiny of several investigative agencies, the bank's board has not yet ordered an independent inquiry and instead has sought to take the side of its CEO and any kind of work in the bank Is denying allegations of nepotism
 global reating agency fich ne kaha he ki isiisiaai bank main maujuuda sankat ne korporate gavarnence ko lekar kai sawaal khadey kar die hai or bank kii saakh tak daanv par lag gai he
 "the presence of the bank's CEO in the credit committee and the bank's reluctance to support an independent inquiry has led to doubts in our opinion about its corporate governance practices," the agency said on 10 April
 ''or yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 In the year 2009, the role of independent directors was also questioned in the Satyam case
 usamen company ke pravartak ramling raju ne munafa bad-chadhaakar dikhaane ke liye khaaton main herapheri karne kii baat sweekaar kii thi

 Also, the age limit of non-executive directors was set to be 75 years
 panel ne yah sifarish bhi kii ki kisi nideshak ko aath se zyada board kaa hissaa nahin hona chahie
 Haribhakti says that it would not be appropriate to view all private banks from a skeptical perspective on the basis of just a few cases as many private and public banks have set high standards of corporate governance
 vah kehete hai, ''hamaare desh ne khud ko kroni capitalism ke daur se baahar nikaala he
 Independent directors must show the highest level of integrity
 beyimaani ke aaropon ke chalate unase ummiden bhi bad gai hai
 "conflict of interest" At the core of ICICI Bank's crisis is a letter written to the Prime Minister in 2016 by Arvind Gupta, a shareholder of both the bank and Videocon, accusing the bank of taking this hand and doing that hand
 gupta ne daawa kiya ki deepak kochar ne chanda se apane rishte kaa laabh uthaaya or apane energy start-ap nupower rinuables main dhoot ko niveshak ke rup main shaamil kar liya
 Investigative agencies are now investigating several deals of Nupower, including a loan of Rs 64 crore from Dhoot, setting up of separate units and Rs 3,250 crore from ICICI Bank to Videocon Group
 kaa karj milane ke chah maheene baad dhoot ke swaamitv vaale saare share deepak kochar ko hastantarit kiya janaa shaamil he
 Apart from this, investigation is also being done on the business transactions of Rajiv Kochhar, whose company Avista Advisory Group used to work for the customers of ICICI Bank
 ise hiton ke takaraav ke pratyaksh maamle ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 "he should have ensured that the business interests of relatives remain far away from the business interests of the bank," says Arun Myra, a management consultant and former member of the Planning Commission
 '' aadhikarik taur par to deepak kochar ne yahi daawa kiya he ki unki patni videokon se unke vyavsaayik rishton ke bare main anjaan thim
 At the same time, in the case of Rajiv Kochhar, the bank said in defense that the husband of the ceo's husband does not come under the defined definition of 'relatives' in the company law, it was not necessary for the bank to express its business interests
 lekin kya yah swaabhaavik nahin he ki aam log or unke saath-saath is pratishthit bank ke niveshak or shairdharak, sab uske sheersh adhikari se eemaandaaree or paardarshita ke ucchtam str kii apeksha karen
 Myra says, "when it comes to business issues, the more you climb the ladder, the more distance you should make from your immediate relatives
 yah hamen khud lagu kerani chahie kisi kanoon ke tahat nahin
 Meera Sanyal, former CEO and chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland in India, has warned the investigative agencies to reach a conclusion before the findings of the investigation
 ve kahati hai, ''isiisiaai bank maamle main jis tarah ke hiton ke takaraav ke aarope lagaae ja rahe hai, vah kaaphi gambhir hai
 We can only hope that Chanda would have revealed these notes earlier, which is expected of any CEO or senior manager according to governance standards
 '' haalanki dhoot deepak kochar ke saath vyavsaayik rishton main kisi tarah kii gadabadi se saaf inkaar karte hai
 "I did not invest in Nupower," he told India Today in a phone conversation
 ''dhoot kehete hai ki jab unhone or kochar ne saath milakar kaam karne kaa faisla kiya tha to company ko ek lakh ru
 Was established with a capital of Rs
 uske baad unka company se koi vittiya lenden nahin hua
 In a statement to the stock market, ICICI Bank has said that it has "full faith" in Chanda Kochhar and "as is being alleged in various rumors, there is no question of bargaining or nepotism or conflict of interest" getting up
 '' bank ke board kii agali baithak 7 may ko hogi or usamen 2017-18 ke liye company ke lekhaankit nateezon par vichaar kiya jayega
 The regulator's landmine cases have also put RBI in the dock over the lapses in corporate governance in private banks
 isiisiaai bank ke maamle main visheshgyon ne wisabloar arvind gupta ke do saal pehle patr likhane ke baad bhi arabiai ke khamosh bane rahane par sawaal uthaae hai
 An expert says that the RBI could have done at least as much as it would have asked ICICI Bank to set up a board committee to investigate these allegations independently
 arabiai ke paas nijee kshetra ke bainkon ko niyamit karne ke vyapak adhikaar hai
 In March, in a lecture at Gujarat National Law University, RBI Governor Urjit Patel said, "in the context of private and foreign banks, there are suitable rules about the health, behavior and internal governance of banks, they (private banks The CEO should be constantly warned by their boards and the RBI can change them if there are major or continuing irregularities
 ''shikha sharma ke maamle main arabiai ne apane isi adhikaar kaa istemaal kiya
 This led Axis Bank to agree to reduce his tenure
 nijee kshetra ke bank ke pramukh bank ke board dwaara teen saal ke liye niyukt kiye jate hai or har baar niyukti ke liye arabiai kii manjuuri jaruri he
 Experts say that RBI may replace him even in the middle of his tenure
 haalanki bharat main sabhi vanijyik bank arabiai ke banking niamak kanoon 1949 ke tahat sanchalit hote hai lekin kendriya bank saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ke nideshkon or prabandhan ko nahin hataa saktaa
 Sanyal says, "the NPA crisis and the fraud in the Indian banking sector prove that there is a serious flaw in the governance of Indian banking
" santhganth ke poonjeevaad or raajnneetik dakhsandaji ne bhartiya bainkon or bankeron kii eemaandaaree ke saath samjhauta kiya he
 a radical change is needed in this direction
 '' ve kahati hai ki bhartiya banking pranali main bharose ko phir se kaayam karne main rigerv bank kii ahm bhoomika he
 Experts say that ICICI Bank had to present any number of technical things to prove that it has not done anything wrong, but the suggestion of corporate ethics was that the bank would have put a more transparent view
 visheshgyon kaa sawaal he ki aakhir kyon nahin chanda kochar ko khud ko credit cameti se alag kar lenaa chahie tha jab videokon ke masale par charchaa ho rahi thim
 She could have put it before the board that her husband had business interests with Dhoot
 kya isiisiaai bank board rajeev kochar ke vyavsaayik saudon ke bare main waakif tha?agar haa, to usne uski taraf se ankhen kyon moond lee thim? kya use bhavishya main kisi sankat kaa andeshaa nahin ho rahaa tha jabaki khaas taur par bank dwaara videokon ko die gaye karj kaa 80 fisadi (2,810 karod ru
 ) NPA was declared in 2017? Immediate and strict steps should be taken to restore the authenticity of banks and to establish confidence in the people that they can confidently place their funds there
 haalanki sari chizon kaa samaadhaan keval kanoonon main nahin he
 Myra says, "law is one thing
 aakhirkaar baat ek vyannti kii nishtha par aa jaati he
 He reflects her character

 com / irfo9a51md Saturday was the day when 13-year-old Prabha Rani woke up in the morning, swept the house like usual, lit the stove and fed the animals
 phir apni donon choti bahanon 12 varshiya savita or 11 varshiya anitha kaa skool kaa bastaa taiyaar kiya or skool ke liye nikal padi
 a government secondary school in a village, about 20 km from Ratia, Tehsil of Fatehabad, is four km away from their village, where the three sisters used to study daily on foot
 lekin us din prabhaa or uski bahanon ko is baat kaa tanik bhi andaja nahin tha ki aaj ve aakhri baar skool ja rahi hai
 Savita remembers that day with scared eyes, the "headmaster" sir called a day before and said to bring Papa tomorrow
 ham dar gaye ki pataa nahin ve papa se kya kahenge
 "prabha was even more scared
 ek din pehle uski teacher roopinder cor ne class main band karke usase kuch sawaal puche or phir maaraa bhi
 She says, "madam first asked me everything and then slapped me hard
" unhone sabko bataa diya
 "the next day when his father, 50-year-old Kripa Shankar, reached the school, the headmaster Rajkumar Singh, who was present there, gave a decree," Your daughters can no longer study in this school
 '' ratiyaa ke ek sarkari aspataal main bhartee kripashankar us din ko yaad kar rone lagate hai, ''headmaster skool ke maidan main baithe the
 Sarpanch (jaychand) was also present there
 ve bole, prabhaa to kya, tumhaari teenon ladkiyaan ab yahaan nahin pard saktin
 Their stay will spoil the school environment
 ''13 aktubar kaa vah din un teenon ke liye skool kaa aakhri din tha
 Now the doors of the school are closed for them and the three of them standing outside that door think what was their fault in all this? The fault is that the eldest sister Prabha is a rape victim
 haryana ke jila fatehabad se 40 kimi dur ek gaanv main rahane vaali prabhaa ke saath usee gaanv kaa ek 65 varshiya shaks sohanlal pichley chaar maheenon se balaatkaar kar rahaa tha
 He used to trade fruits outside his school
 prabhaa itani choti thi ki use yah abhas tak nahin tha ki uske saath kya ho rahaa he? uski maa nahin he or pita kaam se zyaadaatar baahar hi rahete hai
 There is a very old grandparents in the house
 ladki ke akeli hone kaa phayda uthaakar sohanlal chaar maah tak is kukrity ko anjaam detaa rahaa
 The matter was opened when she was conceived
 vah kahati he, ''do maheene se maahvaaree nahin hui thi
 There was a stomach ache
 doctor ke paas gaye to usne kaha ki pet main baccha he
 Then shot to drop the child
 ''magar yah sawaal dahalaata he ki chaar maah tak vah yah sab karata rahaa or prabhaa ne munh nahin kholaa
 Why? Even today the fear on Prabha's face answering this question can be clearly read, "he used to threaten that beware, who told someone
 main tuje jaan se maar daaloongaa
 i could not say anything because of fear
 '' lekin is na bolne ke peeche dar sirf mar jane kaa nahin he
 There is another fear about which her younger sister Savita opens her mouth first, "whatever the man does, the name is bad for the girl
" samaaj use acchhee najar se nahin dekhtaa'' udhar prabhaa ankhon main aansu bharkar apni safai detii he, ''bolan tai dar laagai he ji ki kahin papa hamahin naa kutan laagen
 "this fear of Prabha was not unnecessary
 asal main yahi hua
 She says, "at first the father asked with love
 phir jab maine unhen puri baat bataai to unhone mujhe thappad maare
 "prabha considers herself guilty of her sisters, father, grandparents, villagers and even in her eyes
" vah kahati he, ''skool main sabko pataa chal gaya tha
 Girls used to look at me poorly
 majaak udaati thim ki yah to apni bahanon ko bhi barbaad kar degi
 "but she is sad about why both my sisters were expelled from school
 If a poor, weak teenager of just 13 years of age does not consider the school to be deprived of her right to study, then hearing this Don't feel shocked
 sadma tab lagata he, jab skool ke headmaster or gaanv ke sarpanch bhi khud ko kusuuravaar nahin maanate
 "we did not expel the three sisters from the school," says Rajkumar Singh, the 40-year-old headmaster
 kripashankar ne khud hi likhakar diya ki main ladakiyon kaa naam katwanaa chahta hum
 While the reality is that illiterate Kripa Shankar does not even know how to sign
 ve kehete hai, ''headmaster ne mujhse jabardastee kaagaj par angootha lagava liya
 "according to father and daughter, Sarpanch Jaichand was a partner in this decision, but when questioned about this, he almost begrudgingly says," i have three daughters of my own
 main bhala aisa kyon karuunga? '' is maamle kii jaanch karaane vaale fatehabad ke atirikt upayukta rajeev ratan kehete hai, ''hamane maamle kii padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki ladki ke pita ne khud hi skool ko likhit main diya he ki main apni betiyon ko nahin padhaanaa chahta
 The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the Haryana government in this regard and demanded an inquiry into the entire incident
 haryana kii swasthya, shiksha evam samaaj kalyaan mantri gita bhukkal kahati hai, ''ham jaanch karvaa rahe hai
 Girls will go to school again and the culprits will be punished
 '' maanavadhikaar ayog se lekar rajya sarkaar tak jaanch main juty he
 Minister-officials are engrossed in the statements
 lekin skool ke saamne se guzarati prabhaa or uski bahanon kii ankhon main ek yahi sawaal tairta he, ''skool kaa darwaja hamaare liye band kyon ho gaya? ''gaanv, peedit ladki or parivaar ke logon kaa naam parivartit a case has come up in the Delhi government, about which you will be shocked or smile
 dilli sarkaar ne 1984 main hue sikh virdohi dangon kii jaanch ke liye special investigation team banane kaa faisla kiya tha, lekin ab uske gathan kii fil hi gum ho gai he
 The Home Department of the Delhi Government has also issued a circular in this regard, stating that 'the file containing the SIT regarding the 1984 riots was sent to the then Home Minister (jitendra Tomar) on 16 March 2015, thereafter
 Can't get it from everyone, that's why all departments are requested to send it to the Home Department if you meet here
 'tippaniyan When asked about Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, he said that 'it is not known yet
 baad main bataaungaa'
 But the government sources are saying that the missing file does not matter on the case, because the SIT that the Kejriwal government had created in its previous government could not start the work and meanwhile the Center made SIT, which was 84 Investigating anti-sikh riots
 isliye is sarkaar kii SIT sambandhit file gum hone se cese par fark nahin padegaa
 But the question is that the government is a complete system and the file is lost in the system and that too related to such a sensitive matter? It cannot be a small or a matter of fact
 dilli sarkaar ke grih vibhaag ne is bare main ek circular bhi jari kiya he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki '1984 ke dangon ko lekar SIT gathan vaali file 16 march, 2015 ko tatkaaleen grih mantri (jitendra tomars) ko bheji gai thi, uske baad se nahin mil rahi, isliye sabhi vibhaagon se nivedan he ki agar aapke yahaan mili, to grih vibhaag ko bhejein
 Comments is bare main jab dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya se poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki 'iske bare main abhi jaankaree nahin he
 i will tell you later'
 lekin sarkaar ke sutara bataa rahe hai ki file gumne se cese par koi fark nahin padataa, kyonki kejariwal sarkaar ne apni pichhali sarkaar main jo SIT banaai thi, wo kaam shuru hi nahin kar pai or is bich centre ne SIT bana di, jo 84 ke sikh virdohi dangon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Therefore, missing the SIT related files of this government will not affect the case
 lekin sawaal ye he ki sarkaar ek puraa system he or system main file kho janaa or wo bhi itane samvedansheel maamle se judi? yah koi choti yaa ai gai baat to nahin ho sakati

 shuukravaar ko dilli ke jamiya nagar main aatankiyon se hue muthbhed main ghayal sharma kii aspataal main maut ho gai thi
 The Delhi Police saluted three guns after the final ceremony to Sharma, an encounter specialist of Delhi Police

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar denied any future alliance with his party JDU with the BJP, saying that whatever the outcome, this chapter is closed forever
 pichley 14 janvari ko bihar vidhanmandal ke sanyukt satr ke dauraan rajyapal di vaai patil ke abhibhaashan par charchaa ke baad sarkaar kii ore se jawaab dene ke kram main nitish ne kaha ki kisi bhi paristhiti main bijepi ke saath bhavishya main koi gathbandhan kaa prashn hi nahin uthta chaahe iske jo bhi parinaam hon
 Nitish said that no matter the future of any alliance with the BJP, whether under his government or in any situation, does not arise
 chaahe iske jo bhi parinaam hon
 Describing the future alliance between JDU and BJP as impossible, he said that the said chapter is over
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke dharmanirpeksh chhavi ko lekar prashnchinh khadaa karte hue unhen chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh banaae jane ke baad bijepi ke saath jediu ke naata tod liye jane par bijepi ke nitish par janamat ke saath vishwasghaat karne ke aarope par nitish ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki unhone vishwaas nahin tod balki bijepi ne gathbandhan ko lekar kiye gaye vaade ko bhuulakar unke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Nitish claimed that Sushil Kumar Modi, who was the Deputy Chief Minister during the NDA rule, had met another senior BJP leader with the then BJP National President Nitin Gadkari at his residence in Delhi last year and was assured by Gadkari
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne bhi unhen aashwaasan diya tha ki modi ko lekar party adhyaksh ke vaayade ko kaayam rakhaa jayega par aisa nahin hone ne unhen endie se alag hone par majaboor kiya
 Following the Chief Minister's disclosure, Leader of the Opposition Nandkishore Yadav stood up from his seat and strongly opposed it saying that they are taking the names of these leaders while they are not present in the House to present their side
 nandakishor kii aapatti ko darkinar karte hue nitish ne kaha ki dedh saal purv desh kaa pradhanmantri kaisaa hona chahie usko lekar ek angreji rashtriya dainik samachar patr main saakshaatkaar main apane vichaar rakh diye the or uske das maheene ke baad bijepi main diwaar main likhi ibaarat ko padhate hue apane siddhant ke kaaran usase rishta todane kaa nirnay le liya
 He said about the uproar when bjp's national and state unit leaders broke ties with JDU that they felt the end of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's era in BJP and the beginning of a new era
 Took nitish ne nandakishor se kaha ki or agar ve sadan ke is satr ke dauraan hi yaa kisi anya din chahen uske liye ve sadan ke adhyaksh se anurodh kar vishesh satr bula denge avishvaas prastaav laakar unki sarkaar ko gira gira den uski unako parvaah nahin he
 When the Leader of Opposition Nandkishore Yadav accused the Chief Minister of being an expert in 'jugaad technology' to save the government, Nitish told him that if he had been expert in this, his government would have remained in 2000
 nitish ke bijepi ko sarkaar giraane kii chunauti die jane par congress ke sadanand singh ne kaha ki is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hue kyon nahin nandakishor avishvaas prastaav laakar sarkaar ko gira dete hai
 Sadanand claimed that the BJP feared that four to five of its mlas would break into the JDU camp by breaking ties with their party
 sadanand kii is tippanee par nandakishor ne kaha ki yah jediu or congress ke bheetar ke prem ko ujagar karata he
 He told the Chief Minister that Nitish has done politics opposing the Congress and is talking about the principle by colluding with him
 mukhyamantri ne saath rahane ke dauraan bihar main sarkaar chalaane main bijepi ke yogadan ko nakaarte hue nandakishor se kaha ki ve roj bhagwaan ram kaa naam lete hai sach bolen ki usamen unki koi bhoomika rahati thi

 The tussle between Nitish and BJP reached a climax when the famous kidnapping case of Suhaul Hingora of Gujarat, which was alleged by Nandkishore yesterday to be the role of a leader of the JDU government, was denied by Nitish
 BJP members walked out of the House
 bijepi sadasyon ke saath sadan se vakout kar rahe nandakishor se nitish ne kaha ki sunne kaa saahas rakhie
 No such report has been released by the crime research department regarding this scandal

 Looking at the letter, it seems that this letter has been written by Sanket Bhondway, private secretary to the Minister of Road Transport and Highways on 3 December
 ye chitthee bengalooru ke vakil ravi gauda ke naam likhi gai he
 It has been written in this letter that 'as per your letter on 1 December 2019, i am directed to inform that all the lawyers of all the states of India are permanently exempted from paying toll charges in all the tolls

 While commenting on this post, some people expressed happiness and some people have raised questions

 In some similar way, another government letter is going viral with this claim, which is written on the letterhead of Sanket Bhondwe
 fasebuk yujar 'amarendra Rai Advocate Highcourt Allahabad 9911492306'ne chitthee aplod karte hue likhaa he, 'ab vakeelon ko toll tex nahin dena hoga
 'it can be seen in this official letter that it has been written to the lawyer of Chennai, Bhaskaradoss
 is chitthee main likhaa he, 'sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantri ke karyaalay ne rashtriya rajmargon par toll tex ke bhugtan se chhot suchi main 'vakeelon' ko soochibaddh karne or rashtriya rajmargon par bina toll die guzarane ke liye state baar council ke die pahchaan patr kii sweekruti dene ke sambandh main dinaank 13

 In the viral post, both the letters appear to be from the same IAS officer, Sanket Bhondwe
 kya he sach?india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki vakeelon ko toll tex se koi chhot nahin mili he
 IAS officer Sanket Bhondwe's letter has been tampered with
 AFWA kii padtalahamane sabase pehle sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay kaa soshal media acount khangala to paaya ki bhartiya rashtriya rajmarg praadhikaran ne 11 disambar ko hetvitke jariye ye saaf kiya ki vakeelon ko rajyamarg par toll tex se chhutkaaraa nahin mila he
 There are some news articles on the internet which show that Sanket Bhondwe had written a letter to Chennai lawyer Bhaskaradoss, but there is no mention in this news that this demand of lawyers has been accepted
 bharat sarkaar ke press soochna beuro ne bheetvitke jariye ye saaf kiya ki bengalooru ke vakil ravi gauda ke naam likhi chitthee farzi he
 With this we also talked to IAS officer Sanket Bhondwe
 unhone bataaya ki vakil ravi gauda ke naam likhi gai chitthee farzi he or vakeelon ko toll se chhot nahin mili he
 The conclusion is thus clear that lawyers will still have to pay toll tax to travel on national routes

 The Supreme Court today granted bail to 80-year-old ailing Pakistani microbiologist Mohammad Khalil Chishti, who is serving life imprisonment in Ajmer jail in Rajasthan in a 1992 murder case, on humanitarian grounds

 The murder case is when he came to visit his mother in Ajmer
 tabhi unka vivaad ho gaya or jhagade main ek padosi kii hatya ho gai or unka bhatija ghayal ho gaya
 Chishti was born in Ajmer into a prosperous family overseeing the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti
 vibhaajan ke samay chishti pakistan main padhai kar rahe the or unhone usee desh kaa naagarik banane kaa faisla kiya
 On the satisfaction of the conditions and Ajmer fast track court, the bench directed the release of Chishti from the jail, saying that we are satisfied that a case of release on bail is made
 nyaayalay iske saath hi chishti ke karachi waapas jane dene ke anurodh par bhi sunwaayi karne par sahamat hua or unase kaha ki vah iske liye alag yachika daayar karen
 When the senior advocate on behalf of Chishti said that he should at least be allowed to stay in Delhi, the bench said that you should file another application and mention that you want to go to your country
 ham usapar vichaar karenge
 The Rajasthan government opposed Chishti's plea for permission to visit the national capital
 usne kaha ki chishti ko jari vija main unhen sirf ajmer or najdiki ilaakon main rahane kii anumati di gai he
 The court then asked Chishti not to leave Ajmer until further orders
 chishti ko jamaanat pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari kii bharat yatra ke dauraan donon deshon ke adhikariyon ke bich unke maamle par charchaa hone ke ek din baad mili he
 During the hearing, the bench also referred to Zardari's visit
 peeth ne kaha ki ummid karte hai ki kal jo hua, vah jari rahegaa
 During today's hearing, the bench said that if Chishti has not submitted his passport, he has to do so
 chishti ke parivaar ne unhen jamaanat par reeha karne ke sheersh adaalat ke aadesh par khushi jataai
 Chishti's daughter Soha told the media in Islamabad that the bail was granted due to the efforts of 'allah' and innumerable Pakistanis and Indians
 hatya ke is maamle main 18 varsh chali sunwaayi ke baad ajmer kii satr adaalat ne antat: chishti ko doshi tehraaya or unhen aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunaayi
 During the hearing, the sessions court granted Chishti bail but was ordered not to leave Ajmer

 After being arrested in Ajmer for his alleged role in the 1992 murder case, the sessions court granted him bail a few days later but ordered him not to leave Ajmer
 hriday or bahrepan samet kai anya bimariyon se peedit chishti doshi sabit hone se pehle tak apane bhai ke murgipaalan farm main rahete the
 The case of Chishti came to light when the then Supreme Court judge Justice Markandey Katju wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh requesting that the Pakistani national be forgiven on humanitarian grounds

 After the relentless efforts of the Central Government, the border pillar of india-bangladesh in which East Pakistan is written will be replaced by Bangladesh
 aapako bataa den ki 1947 main desh kaa bantwaaraa hone ke baad maujuuda pakistan ko pakistan or bangladesh ko east pakistan ke taur par janaa jaataa tha

 This is not magic, only a little faith in your ability and some hard work is required
 syria main america hamalon ke baad uttar korea or america ke bich tanatani badhati ja rahi he
 North Korea warned the US that the US should not mistake it as Syria
 uttar korea kii sarkari media ne mangalvaar ko chetavanee di ki agar america ne uksaaya to unka desh parmaanu hamalaa kar saktaa he
 North Korea's official newspaper Rodong Sinmun has said that the country is ready to respond to any aggression by the United States
 hamaari revolutionari sena dushman kii sabhi gatividhiyon par najar rakh rahi he
 In addition, the nuclear surveillance system is not only keeping an eye on South Korea and its military bases on the Pacific Ocean but also on the US mainland
 ’iske alaava dakshin korea ke kaaryvahak raashtrapati hwang kyo aan ne sena se chaukas rahane or america fouj ke saath sahyog badhaane ko kaha he
 He feared that North Korea could take any provocative action other than nuclear tests
 uttar korea seemaa par china ne tainaat kiye dedh lakh sainikvahin, uttar korea par america hamale se upajane vaale bhavi halaat se nipatane ke liye china ne bhi qamar kas lee he
 China has deployed about 1
5 lakh troops on North Korea border
 pipuls libration army force kii medical or byaap uniton ko china-uttar korea seemaa par sthit yaaluu nadi ke kinare tainaat kiya gaya he
 At the same time, Trump has once again said that if China does not take any action against North Korea's nuclear program, then the US is ready to act alone
 trump ne kaha ki yadi china hamaari sahaayta karne kaa faisla karata he to yah uske liye bahut acha hoga or yadi vah aisa nahin karata he to yah kisi ke liye acha nahin hoga
 Facebook has been accused of hurting democracy
 data scandle main aarope lage hai ki fasebuk ne quij ap kii madad se lagbhag 5 karod fasebuk yugers kii nijee jaankaree share kii
 This data reached the Cambridge Analytica and used it to influence voters in the US presidential election by micro-targeting it
 is scandle ke baahar aane par duniyabar kii agency, sansthaaen or logphessbukke saath apane rishte par phir se vichaar kar rahe hai
 However, nothing like this is happening in India
 jab ek taraf jahaan fasebuk par loktantr or usamen hone vaale chunavi prakriyaaon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aarope lag rahe hai, vahiin duusari taraf bharat kaa chunaav ayog karnataka chunaav main fasebuk ke saath milakar kaam karegaa
 In such a situation, questions are arising as to why this is being done? Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself has apologized and assured to correct everything
 britain ke saansad jakarberg se poochtacha karnaa chaahate hai
 They suspect that Facebook has also tried to influence the electoral process in their country
 america main yahi karne kii soch rahaa he or mark jakarberg ne sahmati bhi di he
 The US regulatory agency FTC is also investigating whether Facebook has violated their confidentiality agreement, which it signed with government officials
 vishwa kii jane maani broujar Mozilla ne bhi privesi kii chintaaon kii vajah se khud ko fasebuk aid network se alag kar liya he
 Many personalities like Farhan Akhtar, many organizations like Tesla company have deleted Facebook page, accounts
 german bank commerzbank or audio product company sonoj ne bhi khud ko fasebuk ke vigyapanon se baahar kar liya he
 The # deletefacebook hashtag has also trended
 aise main yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki chunaav ayog us fasebuk ke saath kaam karne ke liye kyon hami bhari he, jiske upar aniatik or avaidh tareeke se logon kii personal jaankaree or data ko share kar voting prakriya ko prabhavit karne ke aarope lage hai
 Facebook cannot be called a force to do everything good
 haalanki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki fasebuk yaa anya soshal media loktantr ke liye kai adbhut najaare pesh kar sakate hai
 The Election Commission is also presuming this
 haalanki khud fasebuk ko is par yakeen nahin he
 a few months, Facebook itself said that it cannot always be good for democracy
 fasebuk product manager samidh chakravarti ne fasebuk company ke aadhikarik pej par likhaa tha ki kaash vah is baat kii guarantee de sakate ki fasebuk kii achchhaaiyaan hameshaa buraaiyon par baari padengi, par vah aisa nahin kah sakate
 This is the right step, usually whenever a company is charged, the relationship with it should be stopped until the investigation of the allegations
 ho saktaa he ki rus dwaara america chunaav ko prabhavit karne yaa crambridge enelitica scandle main fasebuk kaa haath na ho
 However the relationship with him should have been stopped until the investigation is complete
 khaskar un sansthaaon se jo naitikta or javabdehiper vishwaas karti he, se aisi ummiden jarur thi
 The Election Commission is not a private institution or small institution
 bharat main koi bhi chunaav koi chota survey nahin hota he
 With this, the future of millions of people is at stake
 bharat vishwa kaa sabase bada loktantr he
 In such a situation, when the whole world is investigating whether Facebook has damaged democracy or not, the Election Commission of India cannot be seen standing and working with it
 aise main adarsh sthiti yah hoti ki chunaav ayog fasebuk ke saath apane rishton ko rivyuu karata or jaanch karata ki baaki sansthaaen or log chunavi prakriya main fasebuk kaa kis tarah istemaal kar rahe hai
 Is it ethical or legal? Christopher Willey, a former Cambridge Analytica employee and dataflower scandal, confessed that his former company was working on India's election process
 yah ek khatarnaak or gambhir aarope he
 The Election Commission should have investigated this and after completion of the investigation, it should have worked with him when it was confirmed that Facebook is right for democracy
 vahiin duusari taraf chunaav ayog ke chif opiravat fasebuk ke is scandle ko bhramit or badha chadhaakar pesh karne vaala bataaya he
 While the reality is that Facebook has not apologized for any confusing and exaggerating scandal

 The story of Maharana Pratap's bravery and valor in the battle of Haldighati is on everyone's tongue
 yah madhyakaalin itihaas kaa sabase charchit yuddh he, jisamen mewar ke rana maharana pratap or maansingh ke netritv vaali akbar kii vishaal sena kaa aamanaa-saamana hua tha
 Let us tell you that this battle was fought on this day 442 years ago in 1576
 is yuddh ke liye maharana pratap ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 It is said that in this war they had half the soldiers than the Mughals and they did not even have modern weapons compared to the Mughals, but they stayed and cracked the teeth of the Mughals
 mughalon kii haalat is jang main patali ho gai thi tabhi unhen shakti singh ke rup main maharana kaa bhediya bhai mil gaya
 Shakti Singh revealed to the Mughals all the military tactics and intelligence paths of the Maharana
 chaar ghante chalaa tha yudhis baat par lagaataar bahes hoti rahi he ki is yuddh main akbar kii jeet hui yaa maharana pratap ne jeet hasil kii? is mudde ko lekar kai tathy or research saamne bhi aae hai
 The battle is said to have concluded nothing
 haalanki aapako bataa den ki yah jang 18 june saal 1576 main chaar ghanton ke liye chali thi
 In this entire war, the army of Rajputs was overcoming the Mughals and their strategy was succeeding
 mughalon kaa ho gaya tha kabjais yuddh ke baad mewar, chittod, gogunda, kumbhalgarh or udaipur par mughalon kaa kabja ho gaya
 All the Rajput kings fell under the Mughals and Maharana was left to wander from side to side
 maharana pratap haldighati ke yuddh main peeche jarur hate the lekin unhone mughalon ke saamne ghutane nahin teke
 They again started gaining their power
 maharana pratap ke paas kam thi senitihaaskaar badanuni ne likhaa he ki “5,000 savaaron ke saath kooch kiya
 "the enemy may have thought that there is an army of 5,000, but this is really just a count of horses, not a whole army
 itihaas main senaaon kii ginati ke alag-alag mat hai
 At the same time, the British historian Colonel James Tod has written that 22,000 Rajputs fought against 80,000 Mughals
 ye ginati isliye galat lagati he kyonki akbar ne jab khud chittod par hamalaa kiya tha to 60,000 sainik the
 In such a situation, how could he send more soldiers with Man Singh? Also, the use of cannons from Mewar was negligible
 kharaab pahari raaston se rajputon kii baari topein nahin aa sakati thim

 'pratap ne jeeta tha yuddh'udaipur ke rajasthan viapeeth vishvavidhyalay ke mira kanya mahavidhalay ke ek professor doctor chandrashekhar sharma ne ek shodh kiya
 In this research, he found that Maharana Pratap defeated Akbar in the battle of Haldighati on 18 June 1576
 dow
 Sharma has submitted proofs of copper letters in favor of Pratap's victory in his research at Janardhanarai Nagar Rajasthan Vidyapeeth University
 sharma kii khoj ke anusaar yuddh ke baad agle ek saal tak maharana pratap ne haldighati ke aas-paas ke gaanvon kii jameenon ke patte tamra patr ke rup main baante the jin par eklinganath ke dewan pratap ke hastakshar hai
 At that time only the king had the right to issue leases of land
 jo sabit karata he ki pratap hin yuddh jite the
 Dr
 sharma ne shodh kiya he ki haldighati yuddh ke baad mughal senapati maan singh va asif khan ke yuddh haarane se akbar naaraaz hue the
 Both were punished for not coming to the court for six months
 sharma kehete hai ki agar mughal sena jitati to akbar apane priy senapatiyon ko dandit nahin karte

 isamen keval vipakshi partiyaan hi nahin, bijepi ke bhi kuch netaa honge
 According to Digvijay, in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP got only 31 percent of the vote
 jise modi or shah badi jeet maanate hai
 But he does not know that 69 percent of the people did not vote for him, then how can you consider him a big victory
 shivaraj par hamale karte hue congress netaa ne kaha ki budhani main ek parivaar he jo sabhi kaam karata he

 iviem par sawaal khadey karte hue empi ke purv siem ne kaha ki koi aisi mashin nahin he, jise hack na kiya ja sake
 Russia hacked the US elections
 isliye mujhe iviem par bharosa nahin he
 The source code of evms is three to four people
 code videsh main daale jate hai
 If you win elections, you will force the Election Commission to use ballot paper instead of evms
 agar mujhe mashin mil jaae to reverse ejineering karne par sorce code pataa chal jayega
 As soon as the source code is known, the votes of one candidate can be cast in the other's account
 agar desh kii 70 fisadi partiyaan yah kah rahi hai ki hamen iviem nahin chahie to phir aisa hona chahie
 What has Shivraj Singh Chauhan done? narmada ke kinare 1800 kilometre kii yatra karne ke baad mujhe teen ped najar aae

 On Rafael issue, Digvijay said that when 126 aircraft were needed, why only 36 aircraft were purchased

 bijepi ne vimaanon kii sankhya ghataakar desh kii suraksha se khilwaad kiya gaya
 Why did you buy 36 planes? Only 60% of that will work
 shivaraj kii vaapasi ke sawaal par digvijay ne kaha ki is baar hamane taiyaari kii he
 Identified fake voters
 vivipat mashin main bhi dikkat aa rahi he
 This time the people will contest elections
 is baar congress sarkaar banaaegi

 pichley kuch dinon se bhopal ko badsoorat karne kii khub koshish kii gai
 He said that it is completely wrong to name a road VIP in Bhopal city
 kya isamen keval VIP hi chalenge
 Recently, hundreds of trees were cut in the name of development
 lekin us anupaat se nae paudhe lagaae nahin gaye
 Nature has made Bhopal beautiful
 shaayar manzar bhopali kii maane shahar kii sundarataa vahaan rahane vaale logon se banati hai
 People here are the protectors of love
 yahaan hindu-muslim saath milakar rahete hai
 However, the poet's pain spilled while keeping his talk in the program
 unhone kaha ki pichley 15 saalon main un jaise shaayaron kii kabhi kisi kaarykram main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan se mulaakaat nahin hui
 He said that some people who are of no use are sitting in Madhya Pradesh Urdu Academy

 8 letters were taken regarding the activities of the Academy, but no response was received
 manzar bhopali ne kaha ki sach likhane par dabaav banaaya jaataa he
 On speaking too much, he can also be sent to jail, because a case is already going against him

 The session was conducted by Rohit Sardana
 bijepi saansad prahlada singh patel ne kaarykram main kaha he ki sarkaar kaa uddeshy sabhi virgon kaa dhyaan main rakhana he, ujjwala yojana main kisi ek varg ko laabh nahin mila he
 If the government has built a road, then everything goes on it
 SC / ST act ko lekar modi sarkaar ne sahi vakt par sahi faisla liya he
 The Modi government never decides the policy by looking at the vote bank
 vahiin congress netaa arun yadav ne kaha ki madhya pradesh main sabase zyada kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 Only 45 lakh youths are roaming in Madhya Pradesh
 arun yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi galat tareeke se gujarat main gaddi tak pahunchi he
 In a way, he has again questioned EVM
 sapaks adhyaksh heeralaal trivedi ne aarope he ki pichley 70 saalon se desh main jati or dharm ke naam par raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Today's reservation is available from birth till death
 aarakshan kaa uddeshy pichde logon ko aage laana tha
 But now reservation is being misused
 heeralaal kaa kahana he ki aarthik aadhaar par 10 saal tak aarakshan dekar dekhnaa chahie
 Seventh session: What's in the heart of the youth? BJP leader Devendra Pratap Singh and Congress MLA Jayawardhan Singh participated in the seventh session of 'panchayat Aaj Tak'
 mudda- yuva ke dil main kya he? is satr kaa sanchaalan said ansaari ne kiya
 BJP leader Devendra Pratap Singh is known as Ramu Bhaiya in his area
 devendra pratap singh ne kaha ki madhya pradesh main congress ne aarakshan ke naam par maahaul ko bigaadane ke liye khub koshish kii
 a rumor spread among the people is abolishing the reservation, which took a violent form
 jabaki aisa kuch nahin hone vaala tha
 Reservation issues were uprooted only for political gains
 congress vidhayak jayavardhan singh ne kaha ki kisi netaa kaa betaa apane dam par chunaav jitkar aata he use vanshavaad nahin kaha jaataa he
 But if the son of a leader gets a ticket and he loses the election, even if he gets the ticket again, it is wrong

 chidambaram stadium par match shuru hone se pehle hi samaa bandha chukaa tha
 The audience had reached in large numbers and it was natural that everyone's name was Yuvraj Singh who was returning to international cricket after conquering cancer
 yuvaraj ne bhi apane samarthakon ko tanik bhi niraash nahin kiya or gendbaaji, kshetrarakshan tathaa ballebaaji teenon main acha pradarshan kiya
 However, Yuvraj will be disappointed that he could not win the team despite a good performance in all the three departments of the game, which suffered a one-run defeat in the second and final T20 International cricket match
 yuvaraj ek baar phir puraani lay main lautate hue dikh rahe hai
 He made 34 runs with the help of one four and two sixes in 26 balls and also took a catch
 unhone do over gendbaaji karte hue 14 ran die or apni majboot vaapasi se pratidwandviyon ko cheta diya ki vah ek baar phir unki neend udaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Yuvraj batted in his old style during this period
 unhone newjiland ke purv captain or diggaj spinner danniel vittori kii gend par wide long aan par chakka bhi jadaa
 He hit his second six over Jacob Oram at deep midwicket
 vah haalanki bhaagyashaalee bhi rahe jab adam milne par pul shaat khilne kii koshish main gend ko hawa main laharaa gai, lekin boundry se bhagkar aa rahe mills or wicketiper maikulam kaaphi koshish ke baavjood kaich nahin lapak paae
 During this, there was also a very sharp fight between Mills and mccullum, after which the game stopped for some time and Mills had to go out with an injury
 darshakon ke haathon main bade-bade binar or takhtiyaan thi jin par yuvaraj ko vaapasi kii badhai di gayi thi
 The Indian team decided to field first and when Yuvraj stepped on the field, he was greeted with a thunderous sound
 baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne bhi haath hilaakar darshakon kaa abhivadan sweekaar kiya
 India initially crushed New Zealand by taking two wickets
 isse darshak adhik romanchit ho gayi lekin chepak stadium shor ke agosh main khaskar tab duba jab pehali baar yuvaraj ke paas gend gayi
 He was fielding at the midwicket and showed the same old agility and agility in stopping Martin Guptill's shot in the first over
 bharat ke chotii ke kshetrarakshakon main se ek yuvaraj ne tisare over main ken williamson ke shaat ko dive markar roka or saaf kar diya ki unhen phir se puraane rang main lautne main koi dikkat nahin he
 In the next over of Yuvraj, Brandon mccullum hit a six but after that he tried his best to convert the same batsman's catch shot
 gend unke haath se chhitakkar chali gayi
 Yuvraj was injured by this and had to undergo treatment on the field
 darshak ekbargi unki chot se sann rah gayi the lekin jaise hi vah over kii antim gend karne ke liye aaye to phir se stadium ‘yuvi yuvi’ se gunjane laga
 Dhoni also praised Yuvraj's effort
 yuvaraj ne apane do over main 14 ran diye
 Yuvraj had to leave the field after this, which also disappointed the audience
 yuvaraj kii jagah kshetrarakshan karne ke liye unke khaas mitra or ek saal se bhi adhik samay baad team main vaapasi kar rahe harbhajan singh maidan par utre
 Yuvraj, however, did not stay out for long and soon returned to the ground
 iske baad unhone kaich bhi lapka or yah aasaan nahin tha
 Laxmipathy Balaji, who returned to the Indian team after almost three and a half years, was flown in the air by James Franklin and was caught by Yuvraj at cover point
 darshak apni siton se khadey ho gayi
 Suresh Raina first arrived to congratulate Yuvraj and later other players including captain Dhoni also surrounded him

 kendriya mantri menka gandhi ne muslim matadaataaon se kaha he ki ve aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main unke paksh main matdaan karen kyonki musalamaanon ko chunaav ke baad unki jarurat padegi
 Maneka said in an election meeting held on Thursday in the Muslim dominated area Turabkhani that i am winning with the love and support of the people, but if my victory is without the Muslims, i will not like it very much
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki itnaa main bataa detii hum ki phir dil khatta ho jaataa he
 Then when a Muslim comes for work, then i wonder what difference it makes not to let it be
 aakhir naukari bhi to ek saudebaaji hi hoti he, baat sahi he yaa nahin?''unhone kaha ki ''agar aap pilibhit main puuchhiye, pilibhit ke ek bhi bande ko phone kar pucho ki menka gandhi kaise thi vahaan
 Do not vote for us if you think that there was any mischief in us
 agar aapako lage ki ham khule haath or dil ke saath aaye hai ki aapako kal meri jarurat padegeey yah ellection to main paar kar chuki hum ab aapako meri jarurat padegi
 BJP leader Maneka also said that we are not the children of Mahatma Gandhi that we just keep giving things and in return we get nothing

 a delegation of Congress submitted its report to the Election Commission to complain on several issues
 is dauraan party shishtmandal dwaara menka gandhi ke bayaan kaa bhi mudda uthaaya gaya
 Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters that the truth is that Modi ji and his ministers have gone mad
 chunaav kii daud ko wo puri karne main apane aapako asaksham paa rahe hai
 Therefore, sometimes by taking the name of caste, sometimes by taking the name of religion, sometimes by taking the name of North and South India, sometimes by differentiating color, sometimes by taking the name of language, sometimes by taking clothes, sometimes by taking the name of food, ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb of this country Want to erase unhone daawa kiya ki modi ji, menka ji aap apane is prapanch or dhong main kabhi kaamyaab nahin honge, kyonki ye bharatvarsh he or is bharatvarsh kii samskruti ko koi mitaa nahin saktaa
 We have told the Election Commission that such a minister does not have the right to remain a candidate even for one day, which spreads hatred and division on the basis of caste and religion
 unka namakan radd karnaa chahie or dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ke liye unke khilaaf praathmiki darj honi chahie

 Knowing the latest status of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA scheme, when i reached Gaaland village in Ghaziabad, a different picture appeared
 gaanv ke pradhan ne bataaya kii mazdoor aksar factory yaa privet companiyon main kaam karnaa pasand karte hai, kyonki vahaan unhen zyada paisa miltaa he

 Subbarao, then telecom secretary D
 es
 In a letter to Mathur, he objected to the telecom ministry's decision to use the fixed prices in 2001 after six years in 2007 and asked him why the finance ministry was not consulted on this financial issue
 is tarah vitt mantralay nilaamee ke paksh main tark pesh kar rahaa tha
 On 23 November 2007, Subbarao wrote a detailed draft note to the telecom secretary challenging his claim that higher fees would result in higher rates for consumers
 nilaamee ke paksh main vitt mantralay kaa tark majboot kiya ja rahaa tha
 On January 9, 2008, a day before Raja issued 121 letters of intent to licensees, a senior finance ministry official, Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram ko spectrum kii nilaamee ke bare main ek sthiti patr saunpa
 This was in connection with the preparations for the entire Telecom Commission meeting, which was postponed from 9 January to 15 January
 15 janvari, 2008 ko chidambaram ke ise 'band adhyay' ghoshit kiye jane ke baavjood spectrum mulya ke masale par vitt mantralay main charchaa hoti rahi
 The exchange of notes and memorandum between the senior bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry in the first week of April is proof of this
 tab tak spectrum kaa aavanton nahin hua tha or license radd kiye ja sakate the
 On 6 July 2008, Subbarao wrote in a note on 'spectrum issues' that the pricing decision was taken in the presence of the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Telecom Minister
 ye dastavej grih mantri pi
 Focus on the role played by Chidambaram, who was the finance minister at the time of allocation
 vitt mantri ke naate unhen mulya nirdhaaran par raja ke faislon ko radd karne kaa adhikaar tha-sabhi vibhaagon main vitt se sambandhit masalon par vitt mantralay ke vichaaron ko spasht variyata hasil he
 Correspondence from November 2007 to April 2008 makes it clear that Chidambaram's ministry officials completely disagreed with the dot's decision not to auction the spectrum
 november 2007 se 15 janvari, 2008 ko peeche hatane ke pehle tak chidambaram khud bhi nilaamee ke paksh main rahe
 Then he wrote in a note that what happened earlier (ie the king's letter of intent), should be considered a 'closed chapter'
 yah dastavej is saal ke shuru main lok lekha samiti ke saamne kii gai prastutiyon main shaamil tha
 Chidambaram has not given any explanation as to why he abdicated his responsibility and suddenly started supporting the king's decisions contrary to the advice of his officials
 sarkaar kaa daawa ki chidambaram bhale hi nijee str par nilaamee ke paksh main rahe hon, ve cabinet ke faisle ko khaarij nahin kar sakate the, puri tarah asaty he
 According to a cabinet decision taken in 2003, the Finance Ministry has the right to interfere in the pricing of spectrum
 doorsanchaar or vitt mantralayon ke bich matbhed hone par maamla antim faisle ke liye cabinet ko bheja janaa chahie tha
 But it was never sent to the cabinet
 iske bajaae, raja kii spectrum mulya nirdhaaran nitiyon ke samarthan kaa faisla 4 july 2008 kii baithak main liya gaya, jisamen pradhanmantri, chidambaram or raja maujuud the
 Chidambaram ignored the advice of his officials for the second time after January 15 on the spectrum pricing issue
 par is baar pradhanmantri bhi isamen shaamil the
 The Prime Minister tried to escape from direct participation
 16 farvari, 2011 ko electronic media ke sampadakon se baatcheet main jab india today ke pradhan sampadak arun puri ne poocha ki raja ne nilaamee ke liye unki salaah nahin maani, to unhone koi drudh faisla kyon nahin liya, pradhanmantri ne khud ko clin chit dete hue sara dosha tatkaaleen vitt or doorsanchaar mantriyon par daal diya
 The Prime Minister said, "after several discussions, the two Ministers agreed that in the case of 2G, especially in terms of the spectrum created and the license agreement, we have to work with the current system
 yah vah prishthbhumi he ki maine spectrum mulya nirdhaaran ke maamle main aage koi karrwai kyon nahin kii, kyonki agar vitt or doorsanchaar, donon mantralay sahamat hai or 2003 ke cabinet ke faisle ke tahat masale par faisla lene ke liye baadhya hai or tri (bharat kaa doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran) tathaa doorsanchaar ayog ke visheshgy-ye sabhi ek hi vichaar ke hai, to mujhe laga ki main nilaamee par jor dene kii sthiti main nahin
 "if, as the Prime Minister said, the Finance Minister agreed, Chidambaram is as guilty as the king
 abhi tak chidambaram ne pradhanmantri kii baat kaa khandan nahin kiya he
 When contacted by India Today, Chidambaram said, "I will not say anything
" ''pradhanmantri puri tarah paardarshee nahin rahe hai
 In the same conversation, when India Today asked why you made Raja in your cabinet again in 2009 despite widespread opposition to 2G policy in 2008, he said, "until then, to be honest, i have no idea The reason was not that something seriously wrong has happened
 isliye mujhe nahin laga ki mere paas raja ke cabinet main shaamil hone par aapatti karne kaa koi adhikaar he, kyonki may 2009 main, haalanki shikaayatein sab ore se aa rahi thim, kuch un companiyon kii ore se, jinhen laabh nahin hua tha, kuch unki ore se, jinhen laabh hua, par paryaapt nahin hua tha, or isliye main aisi sthiti main nahin tha ki us samay tak raja kii karatuuton main gambhir taur par kuch galat he, yah soch paata
 By saying that the complaints were coming only from the affected companies, Manmohan Singh was turning a blind eye to the complaints coming from senior officials from within his own government, like Subbarao and Additional Secretary Sindhushree Khullar
 yah avishwasaneey lagata he ki pradhanmantri apane behad varisht adhikariyon ke vichaaron se anjaan the
 On November 22, 2007, the then Finance Secretary Subbarao, the then Telecom Secretary D
K
 es
 1,600-1,600 crore from three CDMA operators (reliance, HFCL Infotel and Shyam Telelink) asking Mathur to confirm in a letter
 shulk lekar desh bhar main jiesem oparator banane ke liye crossover license dene main uchit vittiya kaary kiya gaya he
 Subbarao's objection to this process was evident when he said, "it is not clear that the 1,600 crore fixed in 2001 was Rs
 mulya, 2007 main die gaye license ke liye, vartmaan moolyankan to chhodie, mudrasphiti ke lihaaj se samyojit tak kiye bina kaise lagu kar diya gaya
 In view of the financial results, the Ministry of Finance should have consulted on this issue before taking your final decision
 ''purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha tark dete hai ki vitt mantralay ko har vah faisla roak dene kaa puraa adhikaar he, jiske bare main use vishwaas he ki vah sarkari rajasav ke liye nuksaandeh he
 "in our system, no special ministry can cut the finance ministry," says Sinha
 vitt mantri kii moolbhoot jimmedaari sarkari rajasav kii raksha karnaa he
 In November 2007, Chidambaram's most senior financial bureaucrat was aware of this responsibility
 subbarao apane rajnatik aakaaon kii khatir is jimmedaari ko kaise bhul gaye, yah 2ji kahani kaa antarang pahalu he
 On 29 November 2007, the then Telecom Secretary Mathur defended his ministry's decision on pricing crossover licenses in a counter letter to Subbarao
 unhone likhaa, ''pravesh shulk 2003 main yueyes (uniphoid acces sarvice) pranali ke liye cabinet ke faisle ke aadhaar par tay kiya gaya tha
 It was decided to keep the entry fee for the UAS license as high as the fourth cellular operator, which was based on the 2011 auction process
 ''unhone yah nahin bataaya ki itane gambhir vittiya nattejey vaale masale par vitt mantralay se salaah kyon nahin lee gai
 The Finance Ministry was not satisfied with his reply
 30 november, 2007 kii taarikh main subbarao ne ek file par note main likhaa he, ''iskaa koi jawaab nahin mila ki vittiya nattejey vaale masale ko vitt mantralay ko kyon nahin bheja gaya
 The same two letters are not evidence that in 2007, the finance ministry was unhappy with Raja's fixed pricing of dual-use technology licenses
 23 november, 2007 ko subbarao ke maathur ko likhe ek masauda gyaapan main vitt mantralay kii sthiti ko vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 Strange that the draft was never sent to the Telecom Secretary
 is dastavej main subbarao ne doorsanchaar vibhaag ke is daawey ko, jiskaa ab khurshid samarthan kar rahe hai, chunauti di thi ki ooncha pravesh shulk lene kaa nateeja upabhoktaaon ke liye oonchi daron main nikalegaa
 Subbarao wrote, "it would not be correct to say that the increase in entry fee, which is currently based on the auction conducted in 2001, will increase the cost of the service
" yadi oparator spectrum kaa upyog zyada dakshata se kar paaegaa, to koi atirikt laagat nahin hogi, jo upabhokta par lagegi
 The finance secretary made a clear argument that the entry fee payable to the government must be increased even if there is no auction for 2G spectrum allocation
 subbarao ne likhaa, ''pravesh shulk kii gananaa 2001 kii nilaamee kii keemton ko aadhaar maan kar or phir usamen spectrum kii sanvahan kshamta ke taur par takanic main aae sudhaar or upabhoktaaon kii sankhya ke taur par maang main hui badhotaree or saath hi prati upabhokta hone vaale sanchaar main vruddhi se milan karke kii ja sakati he
 "obviously, the Finance Ministry had the option of auctioning it to increase the price of licenses, but decided not to send it to the Department of Telecommunications
 kyon?janvari, 2008 ke shuru main chidambaram ne samooche doorsanchaar ayog kii baithak par jor dekar raja kii koshish ko sire na chadhane dena chaha, jisamen vitt, doorsanchaar, soochna praudyogiki or udyog mantralayon ke alaava yojana ayog ke bhi adhikari hote hai
 The full commission has the authority to cut TRAI, which recommended the first-come, first-served method for 2G licenses
 raja pehle 9 janvari ko doorsanchaar ayog kii baithak ke liye sahamat hue
 On January 3, Chidambaram was told that the meeting has been postponed to January 15
 10 janvari ko hi 121 licensiyon ko aashay patr jari karne kii raja kii yojana se anbhigya khullar ne 9 janvari ko ek note main likhaa, ''vitt mantri ne nirdesh diya he ki spectrum ke mulyon or doorsanchaar sangharshon par pichley do maheenon kii sarthak press reporton par gaur kiya jaae
 The allocation of 2G spectrum and additional licenses to existing and new entrants is currently the most controversial topic to attract public attention and a status paper has been prepared on it
 iske masaude par vitt sachiv ke saath charchaa kii gai thi or antim masauda sanlagn he
 The entire Telecom Commission was supposed to meet today, but now this meeting has been postponed till January 15, 2008
 vitt sachiv ne ichha vyakt kii he ki is baithak main main unka pratinidhitiv karun
 "khullar, who was later sent to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, writes in this position paper," The most transparent method of spectrum allocation will be through auction
 ''10 janvari ko raja samooche doorsanchaar ayog kii baithak kii pratiksha kiye bagaiyr licensiyon ko 121 aashay patr jari karne kii disha main sidhe aage bad gaye
 Chidambaram should have objected to this, but he did not
 unhone is sthiti patr ko 15 janvari, 2008 ko pradhanmantri ko bheje apane gopneey note kaa aadhaar banaaya, jisamen unhone bhavishya main spectrum ke aavanton ke liye nilaamee aadhaarit pranali ke paksh main tark diya
 He also said that spectrum allocations made in the past should be considered as 'closed chapters'
 doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne haal hi main ek saakshaatkaar main safai dene kii cheshtaa kii, ''yah ek mat he
 January 15 is the date after the incident occurred
 tab tak aashay patr jari kiye ja chuke the
 The Finance Minister considered it after this
 iske pehle unka vichaar doorsanchaar vibhaag se nahin miltaa tha, par chali doorsanchaar vibhaag kii
 Sibal's explanation cannot be completely convincing
 aashay patr 10 janvari ko jari jarur ho gaye the, par license samajhaiton par dastakhat 27 farvari se 7 march ke bich hue the
 The actual allocation of spectrum was not done till April
 nilaamee par jor dene ke liye chidambaram or subbarao ke paas kaaphi samay tha
 But he gave up his obligations
 30 janvari, 2008 ko chidambaram or raja kii baithak ke kaaryvivaran, jisamen subbarao bhi the, chaar baton kaa khulaasa karte hai: ab iske aage jo karnaa hoga, vah kanoonee drushti se majboot aadhaar par hona chahie

 Between 3 April and 7 April 2008, the issue of pricing of spectrum came up again during the exchange between Khullar and Subbarao
 khullar ne is maamle main ek ahm bindu joda
 He wrote, "basic issues related to pricing of spectrum can be raised at this stage
 '' jawaab main subbarao ne kaha, ''vitt mantri raji hue ki spectrum ke istemaal kaa shulk badhaayaa jaae
 Subbarao directed that an office memorandum be issued reflecting the views of the Finance Minister
 yah kaam 1989 batch ke iees adhikari or vitt mantralay main infrastracchar nideshak govind mohan ko saunpa gaya
 On April 9, 2008, while waiting for a flight to London at Delhi Airport, Chidambaram saw the report of a business daily detailing Mohan's office memorandum
 usamen boli lagaae jane ke paksh main vitt mantralay kii raay di gai thi
 It is said that Chidambaram was very upset over this
 badtar to yah ki mohan ne galat letterhed-aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag kii jagah vyay vibhaag ke letterhed-par note likh diya
 Chidambaram reprimanded Mohan on the phone from the airport itself
 india today ke paas subbarao ke nirdesh ke teen din baad 10 april, 2008 ko mohan kii ore se likhit maafee maangane vaala patr he
 In this, he has accepted full responsibility of issuing wrong office memorandum on the wrong letterhead
 isamen li hone kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Mohan wrote, "the mistake, inadvertently correct, is completely undersigned
 '' mohan kaa maafinama bhartiya ucchayog ke ek adhikari kii marfat turant landan main chidambaram ke paas bhej diya gaya
 In the finance ministry note dated February 11, 2008, cited by Subbarao, an option has been given to auction for higher income
 isamen sujhaayaa gaya tha ki sarkaar 1,651 karod ru
 5,772 crores on an all India license instead of Rs
 kama sakati thi
 This suggestion was also rejected by the Finance Minister
 17 april, 2008 ko ek anya asaamaanya patrachaar main vitt mantralay ne spectrum mudde par doorsanchaar vibhaag ko ek patr (non paper) bheja
 According to a senior official in the finance ministry then, it was Chidambaram who directed the non-paper to be sent
 yashavanth sinha kehete hai, ''ajeeb he ki koi sarkari vibhaag non paper ke jariye duusare sarkari vibhaag se patrachaar kare
 It is generally used in diplomatic correspondence
 ''isamen vitt mantralay doorsanchaar vibhaag se siddhant rup main sahamat tha ki shuruyaat main spectrum kii nilaamee na kii jaae
 Moreover, it strongly supported the international competitive bidding process for 3G spectrum with two conditions
 pehali shart use anivaary rup se bazaar main utaarna thi
 If it is not launched within a year, the spectrum will be withdrawn and the bid payment will be forfeited
 duusari yogyata ke liye vishesh sharten thim, taaki gambhir pratiyogi hi maidan main aaen
 This was the opposite of what the king had done in January
 par chidambaram ne pradhanmantri or raja ke saath 4 july, 2008 kii baithak main nilaamee par jor nahin diya
 According to a former finance ministry official, "when Subbarao returned from the meeting, he told us that he (chidambaram and himself) had conceded defeat
 '' do maheene baad subbarao ko bhartiya rigerv bank kaa governor bana diya gaya
 The opposition did not delay in targeting Chidambaram
 bhaajapa ke saath hi anna dramuk pramukh jayalalita unke istife kii maang kar chuki hai
 But is Chidambaram just a scapegoat? Is the matter even higher? 10 aktubar ko supreme court janata party ke netaa subramanyam swami kii yachika par vichaar karegaa ki 2ji spectrum maamle main chidambaram kii bhoomika kii jaanch sibiai se karwaai jaae
 If the court gives this order, the Home Minister will have to resign
 sthiti kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue apane khilaaf aaropon par chidambaram kii chuppi chaunkaane vaali he
 These allegations against him start with Swamy and end on a note sent by the Finance Ministry to the PMO on March 25, 2011
 kya chidambaram kii chuppi pradhanmantri kii sambhavit bhoomika ko ujagar hone se bachaane ke liye he
 "A strange thing," said a cabinet minister
 chidambaram ne raja kaa aadesh nirast kar nilaamee kii prakriya ke liye kyon nahin dabaav daalaa, isaki vajah yahi he ki raja ke faisle main pradhanmantri kii rajamandi thi
 "the prime minister is guilty of defaulting," says Sinha, as he did not take steps when he could stop the allocation of spectrum
 tatkaaleen vitt mantri is baat ke doshi hai ki unhone moulik faisle ko chhod diya, jisamen spectrum ke durlabh hone ke kaaran uski nilaamee kii baat kahi gai thi
 "congress mps are unhappy with the Prime Minister's attempt to keep distance from this entire episode and leave all responsibility on Chidambaram's shoulder
" party grih mantri ke peeche khadi ho gai he
 Even Chidambaram's detractors like Digvijay Singh defended him in the media, saying, "he is an honest and capable person
" un par kisi aarope kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 Sonia Gandhi has given the order to defend Chidambaram
 congress netritv jaanata he ki us samay koi bhi vitt mantri hota vahi karata, jo chidambaram ne kiya
 The Congress could not do much due to coalition pressure, as the government would have collapsed without the support of DMK mps
 supreme court chidambaram kii bhoomika kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kaa faisla 2ji ghotaale kii sunwaayee kar rahi nichali adaalat par chhod saktaa he
 The Central Government's counsel in the 2G case in the Supreme Court p
 pi
 Rao argued that the demand for a CBI probe into Chidambaram's role should be clubbed with a lower court probe
 isse chidambaram or congress ko kuch mohalat mil jaaegi
 This may delay, but the contradictions will not end
 10, janpath ke saath najdiki ke liye khyath chidambaram party ke liye itane mahatvapurn hai ki unki bali nahin lee ja sakati
 If this happens, all the attention will be shifted to the role of Prime Minister
 manmohan jaanate hai ki gathbandhan ke dabaav kaa unka tark adaalat main nahin chalegaa
 This has already been dismissed in public court
 2ji spectrum ke maamle main chidambaram ko istipha dena padaa to upie kii sthirataa khatre main pad sakati he
 And then elections are to be held in five states next year

 Meanwhile, everything in the Ministry of Home Affairs looks like before
 grih mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ''chidambaram pehle kii tarah baithken kar rahe hai
 They are still rude
 ''koi nahin jaanata ki ve kya soch rahe hai
 However, the tweet of son Karti definitely shows some of his mood
 unhone likhaa, ''dushprachaar se janme sankat main acchhee baat yah he ki isamen sachche mitron kii pahchaan ho jaati he
 Chidambaram is busy pursuing his favorite scheme, the National counter-terrorism Center
 ek cabinet sahakarmi ne kaha, ''grih mantralay main unka vikalp khojna mushkil hoga
 Despite the poor record against Naxalites, there are few people who can handle this ministry so efficiently
 ''chidambaram kii kai chintaaen hai
 One is a challenge given to his election in a Tamil Nadu court

 Chidambaram said, "the meeting was held after talking to the collectors
 ''chidambaram 2011 main manmohan singh kii jagah lene kaa sapana dekhne lage the
 But in September a district collector shocks him
 jaahir he, pi
 This is not the right time for Chidambaram
 gale nahin utarati manmohan kii khud ko di gai clin chit16 farvari 2011 ko tivi sampadakon ke saath baatcheet main, pradhanmantri ne india today ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki spectrum mulya nirdhaaran ke masale par chidambaram or raja 'sahamat' the
 If Chidambaram had agreed, then he would have his cabinet colleague A
 raja jitne hi doshi kyon nahin hai ?pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unhone mulya nirdhaaran kii niti main isliye hastkshep nahin kiya, kyonki vah 2003 main cabinet ke ek faisle par aadhaarit thi
 Why did the UPA Prime Minister feel the need to follow the five-year-old cabinet decision of the NDA government? In a conversation with a group of editors in February 2011, the Prime Minister said that in February 2009 he had no reason to believe That something has gone seriously wrong
 yah sahi nahin he
 The media had been inundated with such reports for more than a year and Finance Ministry officials had repeatedly conveyed all information to the Finance Minister
 sibiai pehle hi is maamle main kaam kar rahi thi or chaar maheene baad, aktubar, 2009 main usne 2ji ghotaale main ek exiar darj kii thi
 And then, if nothing was wrong, why were they reluctant to give the same ministry to Raja? Letters of intent were issued in January 2008 and spectrum was allocated in April 2008
 isliye jab vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar isse kahin zyada rajasav juta sakati he, to phir aavanton ko radd kyon nahin kar diya gaya ?jab raja ne 2 november, 2007 ko pradhanmantri ko suchit kiya tha ki ve cat-of tithi 1 aktubar, 2007 ko sarkaakar 25 sitambar, 2007 karne ja rahe hai, to pradhanmantri ne aapatti kyon nahin kii? 12 march, 2010 ko suhdhim court ne kaha ki raja kaa kadam gaiyrkanoonee tha
 Dual talk about spectrum Sindhushree Khullar, additional secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs, prepared a detailed concept paper on telecom policy on 9 January 2008, in which he recommended a new policy which could guarantee that the government would get more revenue
 sibiai ne 2 april, 2011 ko daakhil apane aarope patr main is kaarividhi ko sarvshereshth rup main sweekaar kar liya
 In such a situation, the question arises as to why the then Finance Minister Chidambaram rejected Khullar, Additional Secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs? Chidambaram wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 15 January 2008, five days after the issuance of the letter of intent
 Said that the spectrum allocated by Raja should be considered as "closed chapter"
 unhone yah sweekaar karne ke baavjood aisa kaha ki ''spectrum durlabh sansaadhan he or uski durlabhta tathaa istemaal ke maddenjar hi uski keemat nirdhaarit kii jaani chahie
 The then Finance Minister also said that "the most transparent way of allocation of spectrum would be to auction it
" ''chidambaram or tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri e
 Raja had a meeting on 30 January 2008
 baithak ke mukhya mudde theah spectrum kii durlabhta or uske maddenjar spectrum kii keemat
 The licenses were not issued until then, so the entire process could be stopped
 iske baavjood spectrum aavanton karne kii prakriya kyon nahin roki gai?tatkaaleen vitt mantri ne tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri ko 17 april, 2008 ko ek non-paper, arddh-sarkari samvaad kyon bheja, jisamen unhone suzav diya tha ki 3ji spectrum kii nilaamee kii jaani chahie
 At the same he also accepted that the auction process for 2G is not required
 vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ne doorsanchaar mantri ko baar-baar likhaa or is ore vitt mantri kaa dhyaan bhi dilaayaa ki spectrum kii keemat bazaar kii nai hakikaton ke maddenjar tay kii jaani chahie
 It should not be allocated at 2001 prices
 agar vitt mantri or doorsanchaar mantri ne adhikariyon kaa suzav maan liya hota to isse sarkaar ko kaaphi rajasav miltaa
 Especially at a time when telecom was the single largest source of annual non-tax revenue of the government

 On the statements of Shahabuddin and Nitish, RJD leader and former Union Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh justified the statement of Shahabuddin, saying, 'there are too many parties in the alliance and Lalu is our leader
 gathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ne nitish kumaar ko siem banane kaa faisla liya
 i did not support it, but they had taken the decision
 'aise badhin mahagathbandhan kii mushkilenraghuvansh ke is bayaan par jediu bhadak gai
 Party leaders appealed to Laloo Prasad to rein in leaders like Raghuvansh and follow their alliance religion
 mahagathbandhan kii sahyogi congress ne bhi argedy netaaon ko chetavanee di ki sarkaar main rahakar siem nitish kumaar kaa virodh bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If RJD has a complaint with Nitish Kumar, he should be out of the alliance
 in sabhi ke alaava sushasan babu ke taur par mashhoornitish kumaarake raaj main shahabuddin kii rihaai ko lekar vipakshi bijepi rajya sarkaar par hamalaa bol rahi he
 There is also speculation that the state government may put Shahabuddin back in jail under the Crime Control Act, given the cm's image
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki shahabuddin kii rihaai ko lekar uthaa siyaasi ghamaasan koun sa mode letaa he
 Will Shahabuddin be jailed or will the Grand Alliance break? Power politics, which erupted in a ruling political family in Uttar Pradesh's SP clash in Uttar Pradesh, has now come to the surface
 somvaar ko mulaayam singh or shivpal ke kareebi do mantriyon gayatri prajapati or raaj kishor singh ko cabinet se baahar karne ke baad mangalvaar komukhyamantri akhilesh yadavane chif secretary deepak singhl kii bhi chuttee kar di
 In this turbulent evening, Akhilesh Yadav was removed from the post of UP State President
 mulaayam ne unki jagah shivpal yadav ko upi adhyaksh kii jimmedaari saunp di
 At the same time, in retaliation, the CM showed Shivpal out of three ministries on Tuesday late evening
 akhilesh or shivpal ke bich manmutav kaa maamla ab netaji yani mulaayam singh yadav ke darbar main pahunchaa he
 When Netaji summoned Akhilesh and Shivpal to Delhi, Shivpal went to Delhi to meet him but Akhilesh did not do so
 unhone buudhvaar ko kaha ki yah ladaai parivaar main nahin, sarkaar main he
 Akhilesh also said that some decisions have been taken at Netaji's behest, some by him (CM) himself
 pichley dinon mukhtaar ansaari kii partikumi ekta dalke sapa main vilay ko lekar bhi shivpal or akhilesh ke bich anban hui thi
 On the initiative of Shivpal Singh, the Qaumi Ekta Dal was merged with the SP, but worried about his image, CM Akhilesh opposed it and Mulayam Singh Yadav himself had to declare that Mukhtar Ansari's party would not merge with the SP
 upi main vidhansabha chunaav ko mahaj chah maheene bache hai
 In such a situation, the arrogance in the political clan will be harmful for the Akhilesh government or as a political strategy, the Yadav family is starting preparations for the next election
 jaankaar maanate hai ki shivpal ko sarkaar se alag karte hue sanghathan kii jimmedaari saunpkar unhen chunaav ke management main lagane kii taiyaari he or vikaas ke naam par siem akhilesh ko aage karte hue yuvaaon kaa vot bank majboot karne kii koshish he
 bjp's state president Nandkumar Chauhan, who had given his advice to his national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya for rhetoric against rhetoric, has been seen on the backfoot for his mistake
 vijayawargeey pradesh sarkaar or party ko lekar or bhi mukhar hote ja rahe hai or ek tarah se unhone pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar chouhan ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 Recently, two big leaders of Madhya Pradesh BJP Kailash Vijayvargiya and Gopal Bhargava questioned the internal state of the party and the functioning of the government
 party ke rashtriya mahasachiv vijayawargeey ne indore metro ko lekar sarkaar par tanj ksaa tha, to panchayat evam gramin vikaas mantri bhargav ne party main chal rahi antarkalah ko lekar bayaan diya tha or aagaamee chunaav main bijepi kabhajpaase mukaable kii baat kahi thi
 When the media asked the state president Nandkumar Chauhan, who was contemplating these statements in Panchmarhi, forgetting his position in the party, he had given advice to Vijayvargiya and said that he should follow Rajdharma and since he has gone to Delhi, Their understanding about the state has reduced
 vahiin bhargav ke bayaan ko lekar bhi chouhan ne unase phone par baat kii thi
 Bhargava had made a clean statement about his statement, but the National General Secretary has now opened a front against Nandkumar Chauhan and Chauhan has come on the defensive

 Olympic medalist Saina Nehwal is disappointed at the rejection of her application for Bhushan Award
 unhone khel mantri se sawaal kiya ki unka naam kyon nahin bheja gaya or saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi se is maamle ko dekhne kii guzarish bhi kii

 Ministry guidelines say there should be a gap of five years between the two Padma Awards
 isliye agar ve uskaa naam bhej sakate hai to unhone mere naam kii sifarish kyon nahin kii, maine paanch saal kaa samay puraa kar liya he
 i feel bad ’24 varshiya sina ne daawa kiya ki pichley saal isi aadhaar par unka aavedan khaarij kar diya gaya tha lekin is saal mantralay ne susheel ke naam kii sifarish karne kaa faisla kiya jabaki usne paanch saal ke antar kaa niyam puraa nahin kiya he
 Sushil received the Padma Shri in 2011
 sina ne poocha, ‘pichley saal jab maine padam bhushan ke liye apni file bheji thi to mantralay ne kaha tha, ‘nahin sina tum is saal aavedan nahin kar sakati kyonki tumne iske liye paanch saal puure nahin kiye hai
 'so i applied again for the awards this time
 to phir iske baad mere naam kii sifarish kyon nahin kii gai
 "after 2010, i won a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games, first Olympic medal in badminton, a career-best second ranking, and a lot of Super Series titles, so i think i deserved it too
" lekin agar aise main bhi naam nahin bheja jaataa ko bura lagata he
 'saina said,' i spoke with high officials
 unhone kaha ki susheel kaa naam pehle hi bheja ja chukaa he
 i can only urge them to look into this matter
 agar ham donon ko puraskaar mil saktaa he to acha rahegaa
 If his name can be sent as a special case then why my name was not sent because if they run according to the rules then my name should have been sent
 ’sina ne kaha ki agar unhen or susheel donon ko puraskaar miltaa he to unhen khushi hogi
 He said, 'sushil is a great player but a medal is a medal, both of us have won medals in the Olympics
 agar unhen us vishesh maamle ke taur par puraskaar dena tha to ve 2012 olympic ke baad aisa kar sakate the

 com / wyseuzz4oz Describing former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the country as an honest and responsible leader, the state BJP has asked today that he should tell how he was forced to remain the head of that dishonest and corrupt UPA government, in which Many scams took place
 tippaniyan bjp's Punjab unit spokesperson Rakesh Shantidoot issued a statement here saying, "former Prime Minister Dr

 Manmohan Singh is an honest and responsible leader, no doubt, but the truth is that he had long remained the captain of a team of dishonest and corrupt leaders'

 The former Prime Minister should explain what his compulsion was for which he was forced to continue as Prime Minister in a dishonest and corrupt government '
 shantidoot ne kaha ki dow
 If Singh can use a word like 'loot' for the Modi government's strategy of fighting black money in Parliament, then he should also be ready for a similar attack
 unhone kaha ki eemaandaar hona or baat he, lekin bhrasht or beyimaanon kaa netaa bane rahanaa bhi apane aap main kai sawaal khadey karata he
 He said that being honest is another matter, but being a leader of the corrupt and dishonest also raises many questions in itself

 Most of us insist on eating only 3 times a day
 wo 3 samay hai brakefast, lunch or dinar
 There are also some people who like to eat something at 4-5 times a day
 jabaki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki din main teen baar khaane se sehat acchhee rahati he
 Because eating in this way digests food correctly
 vahiin kuch logon kaa kahana he ki din main 5 se 6 baar thode- thode samay par khaane sharir healdi rahata he
 Come, know how many times a day should be eaten, if you believe in the Khanhealth Expert then eating from time to time throughout the day is more beneficial

 Also, eating this way strengthens our metabolic power

 Energy remains in the body
 agar aap vajan kam karnaa chaahate hai to din main teen baar heavi khaane ke bajaae gep karke thodaa-thodaa khaaen
 This way of eating food is more beneficial for health
 kyonki is tarah khaane se sharir menmetabolismasthir rahata he
 Due to which weight can be reduced easily
 health export kaa yah bhi kahana he ki diabetes ke marijon ko din main kam se kam 5 baar thode-thode samay par khaanaa chahie
 Because the blood sugar remains in the control level
 saath hi isse calories bern hoti hai or sharir ko bharpoor maatra main protein miltaa he
 However, each person's body functions differently
 isliye apane sharir ke dhyaan main rakhkar hi hamen khaanaa chahie
 Whether you want to eat 3 times a day or 6 times, it is important that your metabolism can work properly
 agar aapako is baat kii jaankaree nahin hai ki aapke sharir ke liye din main kitni baar khaanaa phydemand hoga to apane doctor se salaah jarur len

 Samaraweera's decision to bat first after winning a toss by an Indian, seemed to be wrong when he had lost five wickets for 69 runs till the 26th over, but Samaraweera kept one end and played an unmatched innings of 104 off 124 balls with ten
