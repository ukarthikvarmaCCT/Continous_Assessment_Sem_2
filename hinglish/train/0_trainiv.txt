 karina kapur or saf ali khan bollywood kii sabase romantic jodiyon main se ek hai
 Regarding romance and item songs with other actors in films, Kareena says she never gives her generous husband a chance to restrain
 32-varshiya karina ne bataaya, saf bahut hi jimmedaar vyakti hai
 i never give them a chance to stop
 unke vichaar bahut udaaravaadi hai
 He is about to stop, this thing is very wrong for him
 main saf se zyada roak-tok karne vaali ho sakati hum
 Saif married Kareena on October 16 last year, after a love affair of five years
 bahut log sochate hai ki shaadi ke baad pyaar kam ho jaataa he, lekin karina kaa maananaa he ki ye roodhiwaadee baaten hai
 Kareena said, i think it never changes
 meraa matlab he ki shaadi ke baad chijen badal jaati hai, insaan badal jaataa he, jaisi roodhiyaan bekaar kii baaten hai
 i think I'm lucky
 bahut si abhinetriyaan shaadi ke baad simaaon main bandha jaati hai, lekin karina kaa kahana he ki vah hameshaa vahi karengi, jo unhen sahi lagegaa
 The comments karina ne kaha, main ek kalakaar hum or kirdaar ke liye jo bhi karne kii jarurat hogi, main vah karuungi
 Bollywood is changing
 hamaari soch kaaphi pragatisheel he
 If i like a character and need to do something for it and it feels right to me then i will do it
 or agar mujhe lagata he ki isaki jarurat nahin he, to main nahin karuungi
 He said, not only now, i have always been like this
 'rifuji' se apane filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaali karina ne 13 saal ke kariyar main khud ko sabit kiya he
 Kareena says she likes to play different types of characters
 unhone kaha, alag-alag tarah ke kirdaar karne main meri dilchaspee hameshaa rahi he
 i enjoy acting in films and i really want to continue it
 karina is samay haal hi main pradarshit 'satyagrah' kii safalataa se kaaphi khush hai
 He said, i am very happy that people like this film
 yah saamaajik or raajnneetik film he jo ki masala filmon se ekadam alag he
 i am really happy that people want to see these kinds of movies
 prakaash jha ke saath kaam karne vaale adhiktar kalakaaron kii tarah karina bhi jha ke saath dobaaraa kaam karnaa pasand karengi
 Saif, 32, said, Saif is a very responsible person
 main unhen kabhi bhi roak-tok kaa mauka nahin detii
 His views are very liberal
 vah roak-tok karne vaale hai, yah baat unke liye bahut hi galat he
 i can be more restrained than Saif
 paanch saalon ke prem sambandh ke baad saf, karina ne pichley saal 16 oktober ko shaadi kii thi
 Many people think that love diminishes after marriage, but Kareena believes that these are stereotypes
 karina ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki yah kabhi nahin badalata
 i mean things change after marriage, human being changes, stereotypes like these are useless things
 mujhe lagata he ki main khushkismat hum
 Many actresses get tied up in boundaries after marriage, but Kareena says that she will always do what she thinks is right
 tippaniyan Kareena said, i am an artist and i will do whatever needs to be done for the character
 bollywood badal rahaa he
 Our thinking is very progressive
 agar mujhe koi kirdaar pasand he or iske liye kuch karne kii jarurat he or yah mujhe sahi lagata he to main ise karuungi
 And if i feel it is not needed, i will not
 unhone kaha, sirf abhi hi nahin, main hameshaa se aisi hi hum
 Kareena, who started her film career with 'refugee', has proved herself in a career of 13 years
 karina kaa kahana he unhen alag-alag tarah ke kirdaar karnaa pansad he
 He said, i have always been interested in doing different roles
 mujhe filmon main abhinay karne main majaa aata he or main sach main ise jari rakhana chaahati hum
 Kareena is very happy with the success of the recently released 'satyagraha'
 unhone kaha, mujhe bahut khushi he ki logon ko yah film pasand aa rahi he
 It is a social and political film which is completely different from masala films
 main sach main bahut khush hum ki log is tarah kii filmein dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Like most artists working with Prakash Jha, Kareena would also like to work with Jha again
 bahut log sochate hai ki shaadi ke baad pyaar kam ho jaataa he, lekin karina kaa maananaa he ki ye roodhiwaadee baaten hai
 Kareena said, i think it never changes
 meraa matlab he ki shaadi ke baad chijen badal jaati hai, insaan badal jaataa he, jaisi roodhiyaan bekaar kii baaten hai

 T
 ramarao ne warangal main ek chunavi sabha ke sambodhan kii shuruyaat ek shlogan se kii
 Shlogan was, "shar plus car aunty Delhi government
" '' iskaa hindi tarjuma kuch is tarah se he, kesiar kii party ke chunaav chihn car main muhar lagaao, yah car pratik he telugana se dilli tak ke mahatvapurn safar kii
 That meant to say that TRS (telangana National Committee) will get the pleasure of winning a large share in the court of Jitaoge
 darasal rajya kii tiares sarkaar in dinon chunaav prachaar ke dauraan desh ke piem ko banavaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane ke liye is jeet ko bada banane kii apil matadaataaon se kar rahi he
 The public is being promised that if KCR gets 16 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats of the state, then the people of Telangana will have to listen to the voice of Delhi
 telugana today ko die ek saakshaatkaar main ke
 T
 aar ne telugana ko desh kaa taqatvar rajya qaraar dete hue kaha ek puraani kahawat he, '' pan
 Bengal, which is thinking today, the whole of India will think tomorrow
 '' lekin ab samay badal gaya he telugana jo aaj soch rahaa he puraa desh kal sochega
 That is, there is a constant propaganda in the state that TRS will get the pleasure of winning a big share in the Delhi court
 haa, or is kahawat ko purana bataakar ke
 T
 raav ne lagaataar gathbandhan kii dhuree ban rahi mamata banerjee par bhi halke se nishaanaa saadh diya he
 K
 chandrashekhar raav daanv chalane ke maharathi hai
 He understands the fragility of opportunity
 pichley saal ke aakhir main unhone rajya vidhasabha us vakt bhang kar di jab paanch saal puure hone main kuch maheene hi baaki the
 Actually, he shot two targets with one stone
 pehla ve nahin chaahate the ki loksabhaa chunaav ke saath unke rajya main chunaav ho
 Because if it were, then the issues at the national level, not the state, would dominate
 maujuuda pradhanmantri ke chunavi mod ko haal hi main unhone dekha tha so, ve jaanate the chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapanit centre sarkaar kya-kya pattey kholegi iskaa andaja lagaana mumkin nahin
 The BJP could get the benefit of the Centre's campaign in his state
 tidipi or congress kii badhati nazdikiyaan bhi unke nishane par thim
 It was feared that if these two parties came together, the problem would increase
 shaq galat bhi sabit nahin hua
 The Congress also left 14 seats for the TDP in Telangana with 119 assembly seats
 darasal pichley saal paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt 'mahagathbandhan' ne jis tarah ekajutata dikhaai thi use dekhne se lagata tha ki rajyon main bhi bhaajapa yaa unke sahyogi dalon ke khilaaf ekajutata dikhaai padegi
 However, with the coming of Lok Sabha elections, the satraps of the states stand against each other in the same way as they always stand
 ab loksabhaa chunaav main bhi kesiar kii party logon ko dilli ke sapane dikhaane se nahin chook rahi
 In fact, TRS has been continuously propagating that if 16 of the 17 seats fall in kcr's bag, then the head of state will have an important role in forming the government of Delhi
 vahaan ke gali mohallo main ''telugana main shaar plus car aante delilo sarkaar'' yani kesiar ko vot do or tiares ke chunaav chihn car kaa matlab dilli main apni sarkaar'' kaa naaraa gunj rahaa he
 Working President of TRS and very close to KCR
 tii
 Rama Rao has taken command of the election campaign
 mjedaar baat yah he ki jis pan
 Referring to Bengal
 tii
 Rama Rao did the same there continuously campaigning in the same manner
 vahaan bhi party kaaryakarta janata ke bich jaakar kah rahe hai ki is baar 34 nahin balki puri siten 'didi' kii jholii main daalani hongi
 Because this election is not limited to forming a Trinamool government in the state but it is an exercise to take the state to Delhi
 jitani zyada siten utani hi damdaar piem pad kii daavedaari hogi
 Although the Chief Minister of Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is not known, but KCR has set an example many times that he thinks of today not tomorrow
 rajya vidhansabha ko samay se pehle bhang karne ke alaava kesiar ne jis tarah se na keval andhra pradesh vidhasabha ke up sabhapati ke pad se mahaj ek saal ke bheetar na keval istipha diya balki tidipi se naata bhi tod liya, vah kesiar kii doorgaami soch kaa hi nateeja he
 They knew the way the demand for a separate state was arising today, if not tomorrow, a Telangana state will be formed
 andhra pradesh main tidipi main chandra babu naidu kii pojishan main aana mushkil tha
 He therefore formed the Telangana Rashtra Samithi
 phir karimnagar se chunaav lade
 He was also a minister in UPA-1
 lekin phir do saal main yah kehete hue istipha de diya ki centre alag rajya kii maang nahin sun rahaa he

 The Delhi High Court on Wednesday pulled up the Delhi Police for failing to install CCTV cameras at all police stations in the national capital even though the installation of cameras began 13 years ago
 adaalat ne is maamle main police ke jawaab ko 'puri tarah se dhul jhonkne vaala' qaraar diya or kaha ki bal ko yah bhi nahin maaloom he ki uske dwaara lagaae gaecaimare abhi tak kaam kar rahe hainya nahin
 a bench of Justice BD Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdev said that the time taken by Delhi Police is not encouraging as far as CCTV cameras are concerned
 unhone 2002-2004 main 190 main se108 police steshnon main sisitivi camere lagaae
 The bench said that it is amazing that even after 13 years, Delhi Police wants to start the pilot project without any time limit
 peeth ne kaha ki police ko yah bhi nahin maaloom he ki 108 police steshnon main lagaae gaye camere kaam kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 The bench also questioned the reasons for their not working
 adaalat ne kaha, 'agardilli main kisi mahila ke khilaaf kuch hota he, to iskaa matlab he ki mahila hi jimmedaar he
 The Delhi Police thinks so
 ' peeth ne kaha ki yah puri tarah niraashajanak he ki police kyon nahin jald se jald camere laga rahi he
 The court said that the central government was also equally responsible for this delay
 ' sunwaayee ke dauraan aap sarkaar ne kaha ki agar centre sarkaar anumati de to vah rajdhani bhar main or police steshnon main bhi sisitivi camere lagaana chaahati he

 Donald Trump, a Republican candidate for the US presidency, has praised the promising Indian students

 Coast Guard Director General Rajendra Singh, State Exodus Commission Deputy Chairman SS Negi along with eminent personalities attended the event
 rabar kaarykram kaa makasad uttarakhand mul ke logon ke saath baithkar rajya kii pragati or bhavishya par chintan karnaa he
 Many celebrities did not reach 'rabar', before the program started, there were many speculations that many big personalities would be involved, especially the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and RAW chief Anil Dhasmana

 In this program of the Uttarakhand government, the representatives of the people were also angry, the thinking was mainly on how to stop the most serious problem of the state 'migration'
 magar ascharyajanak rup se jin kshetron main palaayan kii samasya sabase gambhir rup le chuki he, unheen kshetron se chune hue vidhayakon ko hi is goshtee main aamantrit nahin kiya gaya, jo kahin na kahin goshtee kii gambhirtha par sawalia nishaan he
 'bad joke with elected representatives of public' Manoj Rawat, MLA from Kedarnath assembly seat in Rudraprayag district, informed via phone that neither he nor many mlas like him got information about this event nor did anyone reach the program
 Received invitation only vidhayak kii maane to ye ek bhadda majaak hi he ki janata jinako chun kar apana pratinidhatv karne ke liye vidhansabha bhejti he, unako hi sarkaar ne ek aise kaarykram se dur rakhaa jo sidhe taur par janata se judaa he
 'family of Excellencies has left the mountain' Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat clearly said that there should be a single person speaking in closed rooms and talking about stopping migration, where does he and his family live? They have left the mountain and gone, but they do not even know properly about the great mountain

 a Delhi court on Saturday warned Arvind Kejriwal and three other AAP leaders that if they fail to appear on May 24 in a criminal defamation case filed by lawyer Amit Sibal, son of Union Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal
 Forcing him to take action
 metropolitan magistrate (mem) sunil kumaar sharma ne kejariwal, manish sitaudiya, prashanth bhushan or shajia ilmi kii taraf se pesh vakil rahul mehara se kaha ki unhen sunishchit karnaa chahie ki sunwaayee kii agali taarikh ko aaropee upasthit honge
 The court fixed the date of the case on May 24 and said, "ensure that (the hearing) will be present on the next date, otherwise forced action will be taken
 ’ adaalat ne sitaudiya, bhushan or ilmi par 2500-2500 rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya jabaki in sabhi ko aaj nijee peshi se dene chhot kii unka anurodh sweekaar kar liya
 The court had earlier allowed Bhushan and Ilmi, who appeared on March 15, to go with the assurance that they would be present on each and every date of the hearing
 pichley saal 24 july ko adaalat ne kejariwal, sitaudiya, bhushan or ilmi ko amit kii ore se daayar aapraadhik manahani shikaayat par saman kiya tha
 In the complaint, he alleged that the AAP leaders had said that he took advantage of his father's influence in lobbying a telecom company in the court case
 aaj kii sunwaayee ke dauraan mehara ne chaaron aropiyon kii nijee peshi se chhot ko lekar yachikaayen pesh kii
 He said that due to the Lok Sabha elections, the AAP leaders are busy campaigning and the court should schedule the hearing after May 16 when the election result will be declared
 mehara ne kaha, ‘ye rashtriya chunaav hai
 They (accused) are not running away from the legal process
 ve bhagode nahin hai
 Amit Sibal's lawyer Mohit Mathur opposed the plea of the accused saying that they should appear before the court
 maathur ne kaha ki aropiyon ko 15 march ko sunwaayee kii antim taarikh se kareeb paanch saptaah kaa samay mila lekin ab tak ve adaalat main pesh nahin ho sake
 He said, 'they are not allowing the case to go on
 ’ baharhaal, adaalat ne kaha ki kejariwal ko chhot dene ke anurodh par yachika vichaar kiya ja saktaa he kyonki vah khud loksabhaa chunaav lard rahe hai
 The magistrate said, 'arvind Kejriwal's exemption petition is accepted without penalty
 anya teen aropiyon kii chhot yachika jurmaane ke saath sweekaar kii jaati he
 ' pakistan ke uttari wajiristaan kshetra main buudhvaar ko kiye gaye drone hamale main 15 aatankwaadi maare gaye
 According to Dawn Online, officials said four drones were fired from the drone in the Dattakhel area
 uttari wajiristaan main beeti 10 july ko hue america drone hamale main kam se kam chah log maare gaye the
 The Pakistan government on Thursday condemned the US drone attack, saying that these attacks could have the opposite effect
 saath hi ise sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki ye desh kii samprabhutaa evam kshetreey akhandta kaa ulanghan karte hai
 The zarb-e-azb campaign by the Pakistan Army to wipe out terrorists in North Waziristan has also been disrupted due to the US drone attack
 isse pehle 18 june ko kiye gaye drone hamale main aath aatankwaadi maare gaye the
 Also, on June 11, 16 people were killed and some were injured in a drone attack at Miranshah, the administrative headquarters of the North Waziristan Agency
 2ji spectrum aavanton main 1 lakh 76 hazaar ghotaale ko sabit karne ke liye koi pakke saboot nahin mili hai
 After the decision of the special CBI court, it is not possible to understand why the CBI has not been able to produce evidence in seven years to prove the scam which was described as the biggest scam in the history of India
 2010 main sieji kii report main 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod ke ghotaale kii baat thi
 On the basis of which the debate was fiercely debated in all the media forums and this scam reached the masses
 aaj jab iske saare aaropee chhot gaye hai or koi saboot nahin mila he, yah faisla ek sadame kii tarah ham sabake saamne aa khadaa hua he
 A
 Raja, the main accused in the case, has written a letter to DMK chief m Karunanidhi
 unhone kaha he ki 'unhen koun sazaa degaa jinhone aapke 80 saal ke raajnneetik jivan ko daagdar kar diya
 i offer the 2G decision with reverence at your feet
 aapane mujhe barf main surakshit rakhaa taaki main is ladaai main pigal na jaaun
 i am waiting for your words

 The press and media did not do research and did not look at the social contexts of the spectrum
 ' Looking forward to the king's book
 saat saalon kii jaanch ke baad sabhi kaa bari ho janaa ek sadame kii tarah he
 Will it really be right as Raja is saying, has any plot been created according to which the CAG worked, then the media worked on the CAG report
 media ko bhi sieji kii report se hi manyata mili
 Vinod Rai not only gave the figures of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores in the CAG report, but also gave many figures
 sieji ne nuksaan kii chaar tarah se ginati kii thi
 67,364, 69,626, 57,666 and fourth estimate was 1 lakh 76 thousand 645 crores

 In April 2011, when the CBI filed a charge sheet against Raja, it was said that the government exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs 30,984 crore
 first post main us samay sieji rahe vinod raay kaa ek intervyuu chapa he
 His book came at that time
 unase 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod kii ginati ke bare main poocha gaya ki aap is par kaise pahunche to unka jawaab tha ki 'hamaara tark saral he, 2008 main niti thi pehle aao pehle paao
 You got x amount, in 2010 you changed the policy and brought you auction and you got y amount
 or y main se x ghataane par hota he 1
 76 lakh crore
 hamane bas itnaa kiya or kuch nahin, hamane teen or aankade bhi die the lekin public imegination ne 1
 76 lakh crores, yes it was a big amount
 ' Vinod Rai believes that it was a large amount
 kya yah chaalaaki thi
 Even then it was a huge amount, so how to accept that there is no one to blame
 kya hisaab lagane vaale ne khyaali pilav banaaya yaa jaanch karne vaale ne sara pilav kha liya
 If those who are insisting that there was a scam then why are they not emphasizing how the accused got acquitted
 kyon unke khilaaf saboot nahin pesh kiye ja sake
 Vinod Rai is yet to speak
 us dauraan media kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi bahes ho rahi he
 Let me remind you that after the revelations of the Radia tapes, the role of media also came in the wrap of 2G
 aaj sab bari ho kar khadey hai
 Media's activism in covering this scandal changed India's media for many years to come
 us vakt 1 lakh 76 hazaar kaa aankada mote phont main hedline banakar chhapata tha
 People used to get surprised after reading this
 outluk or open magazine ke cover par 2ji ke khulaase ne sansani failaa di thi
 Outlook printed Radia tape
 isi ke cover par sieji vinod raay nayak kii tarah chape the
 The headline for them was 'the Man Who Rocked the UPA', the headline of the Times of India was, 'CAG Draft Report Nails Raja Roll in Scam', Debate caught a rebound in TV channels
 anna hazaare kaa andolan upie ke saamne khadaa kiya gaya
 The Center for Media has a report
 iske anusaar 2011 main 2005 ke mukaable tivi par bhrashtachar ke maamalon kaa kawarej 11 guna bad gaya tha
 Was there a plot behind it or did the media also trust the CAG thing
 media main kai patrkaar sieji kii report se aage jaakar research bhi kar rahe the, or report bhi kar rahe the
 Today, in the context of the acquittal of everyone, those who did propaganda, even those who did journalism, all appear in the same line
 kairavan patrika ke haratosh singh bal ne us vakt badi saahasik reporting kii thi
 He says that it would not be right to dismiss the entire media
 haratosh singh bal us vakt open patrika main the jiske cover par 2ji kii khabaron kaa khub jalawaa hota tha
 Hartosh has a point that it is difficult to dismiss the entire report
 sibiai kii jaanch main bhoomika par sawaal hone chahie ki aakhir itane log kaise batch gaye, lekin jab saboot hi nahin mili to phir wo sawaal kisase poochna chahie, vinod raay to hai nahin, kya us vakt sieji ke adhikari kii baat sahi he ki unase jabaran report par dastakhat karaayaa gaya
 RK Singh is no longer in the world
 congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha he ki media ko aatmamanthan karnaa chahie
 Through the media, a corrupt environment was created in the country
 di print website par shekhar gupta ne likhaa he ki 'us vakt talcom ghotaalaa hua tha
 The scam was huge but someone forgot to tell the judge about it
 bade ghotaalon kii tarah ise bhi is tarah se khadaa kiya gaya taaki adaalat main tik na sake
 The prosecution, the CBI has become so politicized in this case, political interests have led to big myths, there has been a series of agitations, that no one even cares about the facts
 dekhnaa hoga ki unka focus kya tha, jail bhejnaa yaa hedline main jagah paanaa
 ' kya sab kuch khel kii tarah hua
 For seven years, the Supreme Court was monitoring, then how the CBI did not present evidence, how it did not do its job and all the accused were dropped or there is enough reason to believe that the CBI could not present the evidence before the judge
 jaj opi saini ne likhaa he ki ve har din subah se shaam tak intazaar karte rahe ki koi saboot lekar aayega, koi aayaa hi nahin
 So what is to be believed, do not accept the court verdict that there was no scam or if the same is done after the verdict, then from 2010 to 2017, there was a scam
 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod koun kha gaya aakhir
 Whose pocket did it go? aropiyon ko bachaane waalon kii jeb main to nahin gaya magar bachaane vaale koun he
 Coverage of the 2G scandal changed the character of TV

 CMS Media Lab report states that since 2009, coverage of corruption on TV had increased significantly
 sarkaar se sambandhit 2ji, seedbluji, adarsh or boforce
 CMS report states that 2G got more coverage by Times of India and Hindustan Times than other newspapers
 2ji ghotaale ko tivi main angrezi news channelon ne zyaada kawarej kiya
 The comments boforce kaa haal aap jaanate hai
 The headline is formed, the charge is not proved
 bambe hoicourt ne 22 disambar ko adarsh ghotaale main faisla sunaate hue kaha he ki is maamle main aaropee congress netaa ashok chwahaan par mukadmaa nahin chalegaa
 Ashok Chavan was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra when this scam came to light
 2ji ghotaale ke daur main tivi kaaphi kuch badal gaya tha
 Reporting stopped, discourse turned on
 e raja kitaab likhakar un logon kaa khulaasa karne vaale hai jinhone saazish rachi or use anjaam diya, sieji or sivisi sansthaaon main baithe logon ne
 Will his book be the final opinion or will it continue to be the headline about 2G, will keep cheating people by lying or is it not the responsibility of the institutions to carry out such a big scam or tell people that there is no scam Was

 The Center for Media has a report
 iske anusaar 2011 main 2005 ke mukaable tivi par bhrashtachar ke maamalon kaa kawarej 11 guna bad gaya tha
 Was there a plot behind it or did the media also trust the CAG thing

 Today, in the context of the acquittal of everyone, those who did propaganda, even those who did journalism, all appear in the same line

 The scam was huge but someone forgot to tell the judge about it
 bade ghotaalon kii tarah ise bhi is tarah se khadaa kiya gaya taaki adaalat main tik na sake
 The prosecution, the CBI has become so politicized in this case, political interests have led to big myths, there has been a series of agitations, that no one even cares about the facts
 dekhnaa hoga ki unka focus kya tha, jail bhejnaa yaa hedline main jagah paanaa
 ' kya sab kuch khel kii tarah hua
 For seven years, the Supreme Court was monitoring, then how the CBI did not present evidence, how it did not do its job and all the accused were dropped or there is enough reason to believe that the CBI could not present the evidence before the judge
 jaj opi saini ne likhaa he ki ve har din subah se shaam tak intazaar karte rahe ki koi saboot lekar aayega, koi aayaa hi nahin
 So what is to be believed, do not accept the court verdict that there was no scam or if the same is done after the verdict, then from 2010 to 2017, there was a scam

 mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ke bete arjuna tendulkar ko under-14 team ke 30 sambhaviton main jagah nahin mili he
 According to 'indian Express', poor performance in selection trials and tournaments has been cited as the reason
 pichhali baar arjuna mumbai kii vijeta under 14 team kaa hissaa rahe the, lekin is baar vah of sijan camp kaa hissaa bhi nahin ban paaenge
 According to sources in the Mumbai Cricket Association, Arjun did not perform well, so there was no reason for his inclusion
 unhen kaha gaya he ki vah khel sudhaar karke mumbai kii junior team main aaen
 He could not even score till 50 in matches organized by MCA during the summer holidays
 iske baad chayankartaaon ne ballebaajon ko ek or mauka diya, isamen bhi vah kamaal nahin dikhaa paae
 Apart from this, there are also problems with Arjun's fielding
 tippaniyan The selector also said that despite many people coaching Arjun, his fielding does not remain anywhere according to today's standards
 unhen khel main kaaphi sudhaar laane kii jarurat he
 His batting is good, but like other players he will have to turn a good start into a big score
 emsie ke sutron ke mutabik, arjuna ko yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki sachin tendulkar kaa betaa hone kii vajah se unke liye sabhi chijen aasaan nahin ho jaaengi
 They have to work hard
 ho saktaa he ki 2 saal baad log ek alag arjuna ko dekhen
 The last time Arjun was a part of Mumbai's winning Under-14 team, but this time he will not even be a part of the off-season camp
 mumbai cricket association ke sutron ke mutabik, arjuna ne acha parform nahin kiya, isliye unhen shaamil kiye jane kii koi vajah nahin thi
 He has been asked to improve his game and join the junior team of Mumbai
 emsie dwaara garmiyon kii chhuttiyon main yojit maichon main vah 50 tak score bhi nahin pahunchaa paae
 After this, the selectors gave the batsmen another chance, in which they could not show amazing
 iske alaava arjuna kii fielding ko lekar bhi samasyaayein hai
 The comments silector ne yah bhi kaha ki arjuna ko kai log koching de rahe hai, iske baavjood unki fielding aaj ke maanakon ke hisaab se kahin nahin thaharti
 They need to improve the game significantly
 unki ballebaaji acchhee he, lekin unhen anya khilaadiyon kii tarah acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main badalanaa hoga
 According to MCA sources, Arjun also has to understand that being the son of Sachin Tendulkar will not make everything easy for him
 unhen kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 Maybe after 2 years people will see a different Arjuna

 Initially in view of the Lok Sabha elections, which was being termed as a surgical strike of the Narendra Modi government against the opposition, that reservation of 10 percent for the economically backward class (edwrus) by the central government is now for everyone in Bihar politics a double-edged sword seems to be forming
 jahaan bhaajapa ko ukvamid he ki edadbralues kaa kota agadi jatiyon kaa vot unke paksh main dilaane main madadgaar sabit hoga
 At the same time, the state leadership of the party is very conscious that in view of the caste politics of Bihar, it will have to keep a careful balance so that the support of other castes will also be retained
 bihar main agadi jatiyon kii sankchaya kareeb 12 pratishat he, jo kuch nirvachan kshetron main ginati ke hisaab se bahut mahatvapurn he
 With a 10 per cent reservation stance, the BJP, which seemed hopeful after the defeat in the recent assembly elections, is hoping that it can beat the opposition
 lekin keval agadi jatiyon kaa samarthan hi kaaphi nahin he
 The BJP or the entire NDA cannot dare to create its image that it is only favorable to the forward castes by ignoring the votes of the OBC and the Backward Castes (EBC)
 bhaajapa or uski sahyogi partiyon ke saamne yah sunishchit karne kii chunauti he ki agadi jatiyon ko khush karte hue bhi vah kahin se bhi obisi virdohi na dikhaai de
 The nexus between obcs and obcs in the widely polarized castes of Bihar has not been successful

 The BJP has also started talking about the latest caste census by 2021
 jad (you)netritv ne maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue taaja janaganana kaa samarthan kiya he
 The rapid response by the political class in Bihar to the EWWR reservation is not unacceptable as caste has been a very sensitive issue in Bihar and the BJP well remembers that it had suffered a humiliating defeat in the 2015 assembly elections
 endie ke ek varg ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki lalu yadav ne sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke aarakshan virdohi bayaan kaa badi chaturaai se istemaal kar phayda uthaaya tha
 During the 2015 assembly elections, Lalu Prasad Yadav called the BJP anti-reservation
 darasal, edadbralues ke liye 10 pratishat aarakshan kii ghoshnaa ke baad bhaajapa ne agar duusari jatiyon ke liye aarakshan kii seemaa badhaane kii maang shuru kar di he to isaki vajah yahi he ki bhaajapa ibisi, obisi or anusuchit jatiyon main apana janaadhar ganvaana nahin chaahati he
 Tejashwi Yadav, Leader of the Opposition in Bihar, has not opposed the reservation given to the ewwlrs but has also raised the existing limit of reservation for obcs, ebcs and sc-sts to 90 per cent in government jobs and educational institutions
 
 unhone nijee kshetra kii naukariyon main bhi aarakshan die jane kii maang kii he
 Presently, there is a 50 percent reservation limit for SC, ST and other backward castes (obcs)
 duusari taraf congress is baat ko lekar chintit he ki bhaajapa bihar main agadi jatiyon kaa apana vot bank majboot banaae rakh sakati he
 On the other hand, the BJP is also worried that the backward castes should not get angry with this decision
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki jatigat rup se samvedansheel bihar main aarakshan kaa is khel kaa nateeja kiske paksh main jaataa he

 i believe that the fathers of Hindi region have created hell in society
 maaen itani pyaar or mehnat se jo bhi banaati hai sab in pitaaon ke kaaran pani main bah jaataa he
 Look carefully, how much a father who is studying is suffering
 sampradayik to hote hi hai
 If you have a father, then ask yourself with love
 kisi ko apamaanit nahin karnaa chahie
 Ask slowly, do not read Dad too
 maa ko bhi kitaaben dijie
 Some fathers are doing matriculation again in the direction of teaching children, so please also ask goodie dad that Dad does not read anything on Cool Gandhiji

 When the junior came out with his son from a school in Delhi, when he came to know that the children had to listen to the Prime Minister's speech from three o'clock in the afternoon to five o'clock in the afternoon of September 5, she got angry
 vah kahati hai, 'bacchon ko unka bhaashan kyon sunanaa he
 On Teachers' Day, the Prime Minister should deliver his speech, what will the children understand? Especially young children
 ' Some such opinions are the principal of Kalka Public School, Dr
 onika mehrotra kii bhi he
 She says that the order we have received will have to be obeyed, but from school children to teachers, there will be problems on that day
 bacchon ko der tak rokane or phir ghar pahunchane kaa sawaal he− bas kahaan se milegi? agar nahin mili to kya parantus bacchon ko skool se lekar jaaenge
 Even then, some arrangements will be made in the cities, it will be more difficult in the countryside
 ' Many principals of private schools are against the government's move, but some appear to be avoiding speaking out of fear
 haalanki shikshak diwas ke mauqe par pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ko lekar vivaad chhidaa to kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri ko safaai dene aana padaa ki ye kyrkram puri tarah se svaichhik he or agar is maamle main koi galatfahami hui he, to isliye ki ise raajnneetik taur par tod-marod kar pesh kiya gaya he
 However, in the circular issued by the government to Delhi or other schools of the country, it has not been declared as voluntary in it
 circular main saafe likhaa gaya he ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay kaa ye nirdesh he ki desh bhar ke sabhi skool puri vyavastha karen jisase ki bachche pradhanmantri kaa puraa bhaashan sun sakenge
 The special thing is that, knowing that usually all the schools are closed at 2 pm, the Prime Minister chose the time at his convenience, not the children
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chunki subah raashtrapati shikshakon ko sammanit karte hai, isliye ye kyrkram shaam ko rakhaa gaya he
 Then there is also the crisis of lack of resources in schools
 bhopal ke ek skool ke principal manoj bhatnagar kehete hai ki skool main bijli ke bill dene kaa paise nahin he to phir kaise jenerator kaa intjaam kar bacchon ko modi kaa bhaashan sunwayenge? vahiin bihar ke shiksha mantri vrushan patel to kah rahe hai ki ye to bacchon ko bhi jhuthe sunahare sapane dikhaane main lage hai, jaise desh ke logon ko dikhaa rahe he
 a private school teacher, Yuna Bawal, says, 'why are pms talking to children on Teachers' Day? This would have to cancel the program that used to happen between us and the children
 ' It is evident that what the Modi government is presenting as a national issue, many people are also seeing it like its politics

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ended the picket after 3 days
 andhra pradesh ke siem chandrababu naidu ke kehane par mamata aakhirkaar dharna todane par raji huin
 But with this, he has also announced to speak out against the Modi government in Delhi next week
 12 farvari ko ja sakati hai dillikolkata main dharna khatm karne kaa elaan karne ke baad mamata banerjee ab dilli kooch kii taiyaari main hai
 From the Kolkata forum, Mamta said that on 12, 13 and 14 February, the protest against the Modi government is being discussed in Delhi
 naidu ke manaane par maanin mamtamamata ko manaane ke liye mangalvaar shaam andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu pahunche
 He said that 23 parties have appealed to Mamata Banerjee to end the picket
 ye ladaai ab dilli main ladi jaaegi
 At the same time, Mamta said that i am trying to unify the country
 mamata ne apni police kaa phir se bachaav kiya
 Announcing the end of the strike, Mamta said that PM Modi wants to capture everyone
 unhen ab dilli chhod gujarat janaa hoga
 On the letter from the Ministry of Home Affairs, which ran for 46 hours, Mamta said that she will be answered
 ye phaltu kii cheez he
 Mamta said that she will go to Delhi next week
 desh ko bachaana he to modi ko hataanaa hoga
 This strike was to save India and democracy
 hamaare iees or ipies ke liye tha
 Mamta Banerjee sat down to sit on the Metro Channel Gate around 9 pm on Sunday night
 unka ye dharna takreeban 46 ghante baad mangalvaar shaam saadhe 6 baje khatm hua
 Then proved that the biggest leader of the alliance, in the last three days, Mamta Banerjee once again proved that she is the biggest leader of the grand alliance
 lagaataar kshetreey partiyon ke netaa mamata ke dharne par pahunche or apana apana samarthan jataate rahe
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav reached Kolkata yesterday and now today Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu also reached Mamta's stage
 chunavi ghadi main modi virodh kii siyasat main mamata kii badhat ko chandrababu ne bina laag lapet ke kabool bhi kar liya
 The direct fight in the name of the CBI, this fight started from the CBI, later became the Center vs
 Mamta Sarkar
 gauratlab he ki chandrababu pehle shaks the jinhone sibiai ko apane rajya main ghusane se bain kar diya tha
 Mamta also took the same step forward and is now directly giving two or two hands to the Modi government in the name of CBI
 baaki partiyon se mil rahe samarthan ke josh main mamata ne elaan kar diya he ki modi aglaa chunaav nahin jeetenge
 Bengal Congress unhappy! Not all anti-modi is happy with Mamta's growing stature
 gathbandhan main piem pad par kai netaaon kii daavedaari he, isliye kisi ek kaa naam uchhalana baakiyon ko pareshaan kar saktaa he
 The same concern is visible in the Bengal Congress
 isiilie kendriya netaaon ke mamata ko samarthan ke baavjood pradesh ke netaa sarkaar bhang karne jaise bayaan de rahe hai
 The big challenge is to unite the opponents of Modi, the BJP is also telling the fact that Mamata's dreams of becoming the leader of the alliance are the real reason for the strike
 aaj kendriya mantri smriti irani ne aarope lagaaya ki is dharne kaa makasad luteron ko bachaana he
 It is certain that Mamata's pace will knock the rest of the alliance partners, but it remains to be seen whether the anti-modi will be able to overcome it

 mamata is aadesh ko apni jeet bataa rahi hai
 According to Mamta and her opposition colleagues, the court's order led to the victory of democracy, while the BJP is saying that the court measured the corrupt

 If you do not step down, people will get you done
 modika kataaksh karte hue unhone kaha ki koi keval ‘‘nehru jacket’’ pahanane se purv pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru jaisaa netaa nahin ban saktaa
 Patel questioned that you cannot become Indira Gandhi by going on foreign tours
 aap dijainer jacket or kurte pahanane se rajeev gandhi nahin ban sakate
 To join the group of such leaders, you have to sacrifice like them
 kya aapmen aisa karne kaa saahas he?modi ne haal main kaha tha ki punjab kaa kartarpur congressi netaaon main ‘‘drushtikon main kami’’ ke kaaran aazaadee ke samay pakistan main chalaa gaya tha
 In the context of this remark of Modi, Patel questioned whether Modi is also blaming senior Congress leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at that time
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf aap sardaar patel kii murti bana rahe hai or duusari taraf aap unka apmaan kar rahe hai
 Patel said that Modi and BJP are trying to erase history and "distort things" to claim that Congress leaders have done nothing for the country

 police ayukta meena ne bataaya ki us maidan ke liye anumati dene se inkaar kuch niyamon ke chalate kiya gaya he or congress netaa kisi anya sthaan kaa vikalp lekar nahin aae the

 The Perhaps very few people would know or be interested
 main bhi nahin jaanata tha, baad main pataa chalaa
 Let's get rid of your dilemma
 bharat kii blind cricket team ne south africa main hue blind cricket worldcup final main pakistan ko haraakar trophy hasil kii he
 
 
 So i met these players today and was very happy
 
 
 or inase jo jaankaree mili, use aapse baant rahaa hum
 
 
 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, England, Sri Lanka and host South Africa took part in the Blind World Cup played in South Africa from 27 November to 7 December
 bharat ke 10 alag-alag rajyon se 17 khilaadi is toornament ke liye chune gaye the
 India defeated Sri Lanka and Pakistan defeated England in the semi-finals of the tournament
 coach patric rajkumaar kehete hai ki lig match ke dauraan bangladesh ke khilaaf bharat ne ek nai ranneeti apanaai, jo kisi bhi team ne aaj tak istemaal nahin kii thi
 India replaced six B-1 players instead of four
 darasal, bi-1 ve khilaadi hote hai, jo puri tarah blind hote hai
 Playing with six such players, India all-out Bangladesh for 111 and achieved the target in 12 overs without losing wickets
 chaliye, ab final match kii baat karte hai
 We all know how entertaining the match between India and Pakistan is, and the final of the Blind World Cup took place between these two rival nations
 pakistan ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 40 over main mohammad ke shandaar 102 or nisaar ali, mohammad akram or anis javed ke shandaar ardhshtakon kii badaulat bharat ke saamne 389 kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya
 
 aisa lagata tha ki shaayad bharat itane bade target tak pahunch nahin paaegaa
 This target seemed even farther when Team India lost two wickets for only 49 runs, including captain Shekhar Nayak
 lekin coach kaa bharosa khilaadiyon par bana rahaa, or phir haryana ke deepak malik or andhra ke venkatesh ne tisare wicket ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari kar bharat kii jeet kaa rasta taiyaar kar diya
 After this, Prakash Jayaramiah and Ajay Reddy shared a 134-run partnership for India for the fifth wicket
 bharat kii taraf se prakaash jairamaiya ne 38 ball main 84 ranon kii shandaar pari kheli
 However, 'man of the Match' and 'man of the Series' Chetan Bhai Patel of Gujarat contributed 76 and Ajay Reddy of Andhra also contributed 74 runs
 zaraa sochie, agar aisa hamaari saamaanya cricket team ne kiya hota to ab kya-kya nahin hua hota
 Everyone would have been sitting in front of the TV, celebrating and the BCCI would have announced any number of prizes
 iske alaava alag-alag rajyon se bhi alag-alag raashi ke inaamon kii ghoshnaaen lagaataar hoti rahati
 How strange, these blind players have no respect
 chaliye, yah acchhee baat he ki bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi khud in khilaadiyon se mili or unka hausala badhaayaa
 The Sports Ministry has announced a grant of Rs five lakh to these players
 lekin dukh kii baat yah he ki saport staff ko kuch nahin diya gaya
 No amount was announced by the BCCI, the world's richest cricket board
 
 
 americane iran par 5 november ko tamaam pratibandh laga die lekin chabahaar port project ko raahat de di he
 It is considered to be a big victory for India

 is maamle main sibiai FIR darj kar chuki he
 Raja Bhaiya is going to be face to face with the CBI team
 dspi hatyakand main unako sibiai ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga
 It is clear that Raja is getting screwed on brother
 kin-kin dhaaraon main exiaar
 
 
 The FIR, on which the Aadhaar agency will proceed, has 6 sections imposed on Akhilesh Yadav's former minister: Section 148: Demonstration with deadly weapons Section 149: Illegal mob gathering Section 302: Murder charge Section 504: Abetment of peace making Section 506 : Intimidation Section 120-B: Criminal Conspiracy

 The day DSP Ziaul Haq was killed, Nanhe Lal Yadav, the head of Balipur village and his brother were also murdered, after which DSP was shot
 is puure maamle main chaar exiaar pehle se darj hai
 The first FIR is in the case of the murder of Nanhe Yadav, the village head of Ballipur
 isi ke baad sara bavaal shuru hua
 DSP jia-ul-haq reached Balipur to investigate the same
 isamen kul chaar aaropee banaae gaye hai
 The second FIR is in the case of murder of Suresh Yadav, the brother of village head Nanhe Yadav

 The remaining two firs have been filed in Jiahul Haq murder case
 ek exiaar upi police ne darj karai he or duusari jiyaul haq kii patni parveen ne
 One has 10 accused and the other has 4 accused
 gauratlab he ki jisamen 10 aaropee hai, usamen raja bhaiya kaa naam nahin he
 Raja Bhaiya has been named in the FIR dsp's wife has filed
 matlab upi police ne khud jo teen exiaar darj kiye, usamen shuru main hi raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya ko saaf bachaa liya
 Only Parveen's FIR mentions Raja

 Let us know how he used to live against all the evils of society in his life, not only by writing but also by his gratitude
 aaie-jaane, munshi premchand se judi kuch khaas baaten
 Received 18 rupees salary, Premchand's real name was Dhanpat Rai
 unka janm 31 july, 1880 ko banaras shahar se chaar mile dur lamahi naamak gaanv main hua tha
 On the suggestion of his friend Munshi Dayanarayana Nigam, he kept the nickname Premchand instead of Dhanpat Rai
 unke pita kaa naam munshi ajaayab laal tha, jo daakghar main munshi kaa pad sambhalate the
 He was a teacher in Chunar in the early days
 tab unhen 18 rupee tankhwaah mila karti thi
 He had an equal grip on Urdu, Persian and English along with Hindi
 lekhan ko romance or kalpana kii oonchaaiyon se khinchakar samaaj ko maanviya sachchaaiyon se rubaru karaane vaale hindi ke mahaan lekhak munshi premchand kabhi ek teacher the
 He used to teach in a village school for 18 rupees in salary
 aise jiya yatharthpremchand ke upanyaas gaban, godaan, nirmala aaj bhi vaastaviktaa ke behad kareeb dikhte hai
 He lived that reality in his life too, instead of just creating a world of fictional creation of his stories
 jab unhone bal vidhwaa shivarani devi se vivaah kiya to us jamaane main ye saamaajik sarokaar se judaa maamla tha
 Not only India, they are famous and most liked all over the world
 premchand kii kahaniyon ke kirdaar aam aadmi hai
 Such stories show the problems of the common man and the ups and downs of life
 aisa tha bachapanpremchand jab 6 saal ke the, tab unhen lalganj gaanv main rahane vaale ek maulavee ke ghar farsi or urdu padhane ke liye bheja gaya
 When he was very young, his mother died due to illness
 unhen pyaar apni badi bahan se mila
 He became single after his sister's marriage
 sune ghar main unhone khud ko kahaniyaan padhane main vyast kar liya
 Later, he started writing stories himself and became a great storyteller
 dhanpat raay kaa vivaah 15-16 baras main hi kar diya gaya, lekin kuch samay baad hi unki patni kaa dehanth ho gaya
 After some time, he worked as a teacher in Chunar school after Banaras, as well as BA
 baad main unhone ek bal vidhwaa shivarani devi se vivaah kiya, jinhone premchand kii jeevani likhi thi
 Premchand was transferred to many places during his teacher's job
 unhone janajivan ko bahut gaharaai se dekha or apana jivan sahitya ko samarpit kar diya
 These are his special stories mantra, intoxication, chess players, night of Pus, Atmaram, old kaki, elder brother, daughter of elder house, shroud, borrowed clock, salt daroga, panch flowers, love full moon, fine etc
 ye thi rachanaaen jo huin puri duniya main mashhurpremuchandra ne lagbhag 300 kahaniyaan or 14 bade upanyaas likhe
 Munshi ji fell very ill in 1935 and died on 8 October 1936 at the age of 56
 lagbhag sabhi pramukh bhashaaon main unke sahitya kaa anuwaad ho chukaa he, isamen videshi bhashaaen bhi shaamil he
 Through his creation 'embezzlement', in a different and interesting way in which he presented the stereotypes of society taking a woman from 'nirmala' and the ruthlessness of society through 'budhi Kaki'
 There is no comparison
 isi tarah se pus kii raat, bade ghar kii beti, bade bhaisahab, atmaram, shatranj ke khilaadi jaisi kahaniyon se premchand ne hindi sahitya kii badi seva kii he

 No one in the whole family has eaten food since morning and there are tears in my eyes for my mentor
 jail jane se pehle ude hue the ram rahim ke chehre ke rang, dekhen pehali tasvirzara sochie, ek parivaar vaala vyakti rape kaise kar saktaa he
 The court's decision is not correct
 baba ram rahim insaan ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi gai he
 His controversy has been framed by the controversy over his dress in the year 2007
 unke viruddh aise halaat banaae gaye ki vah funs jaaen
 After all, who can save prostitutes, how can they do this? baba ram rahim insaan kii apni 3 betiyaan hai or vah parivaar ke saath rahete hai
 One of their 3 daughters is adopted
 bhala betiyon vaala koi pita kaise rape jaisi harakat kar saktaa he
 Ram Rahim Arrest, Ambala Jail reached from the seven hundred acre palace and then the question also arises why Baba got caught in the rape case
 kai adaalaton main itane saal se rape ke maamle chal rahe hai
 Baba was in good deeds and limelight so this gaz fell on him
 yahaan unako fansaaya gaya he
 Baba never supported any party
 unhone hameshaa kaha ki jise desh sahi samajhataa he use vot den
 Then our Guru has helped the government even in times of disasters
 jahaan bhi dughartnaayen yaa aapadaa ai, vahaan deraa ke logon ne jaakar jitna ho sake utana sahyog kiya
 The orgy of the Dera supporters continues, looking at these pictures will be heartbreaking, the law may also be misleading
 agar guru bhagwaan nahin he to kanoon bhi bhagwaan nahin he
 Then evidence can be produced to present in court
 ye baat aaj ke daur main kitni aasaan he, ise sabhi samajhate hai
 Our Guru told the supporters to go back
 lekin vaapasi kaa koi saadhan nahin tha kyonki bas or trainen to pehle hi radd ho gai thim
 At the same time, his anti group is taking advantage of the crowd
 waapas jane kaa saadhan na hone se bheed ho gai he or isi bich virodhiyon ke bheje log aisi harakatein kar rahe hai jinase dere ke pramukh or unke samarthakon kaa naam kharaab ho
 Followers of the camp are continuously posting videos of girls living in the ashram on Facebook
 iske jariye ve chaahate hai ki unase sunen ki wo kya kahana chaah rahi hai or bataa saken ve yahaan kitni surakshit hai
 But nobody showed this thing
 aapako ye bhi jaankaree honi chahie ki offison main bhi deraa samarthakon ko pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 To our knowledge, no one was allowed to attend the meeting because he is a supporter of the Dera and considers Ram Rahim Insaan as his Guru
 aise main baat uske naukari chhod dene par aa gai he

 ) akshay kumaar bhartiya naagarik nahin hai
 This was revealed during voting in Mumbai
 kai sitaron ne vot die
 His wife Twinkle also voted
 lekin is suchi main akshay kumaar nahin the, kyonki unhone canada kii naagarikta le rakhi he
 But does Akshay become few Indians due to lack of citizenship
 
 
 ? ittfa se pichley kuch varshon main unhone lagaataar aisi filmein kin, jinka vaasta deshbhakti se he
 Rather, showing some extra loyalty, he also did films like 'toilet - Ek Prem Katha' and 'padman' promoting absolutely government programs
 or to or, ain chunaavon ke bich unhone pradhanmantri kaa intervyuu kiya or desi chutkule bhi saajha kiye
 If you want, you can ask whether the Prime Minister should have given such an interview to a foreigner, but this question has no meaning
 akshay bhartiya naagarik na hote hue bhi puri tarah bhartiya hai
 The same thing can be said about some other stars whose citizenship is technically from another country
 ittfa se jab ye panktiyaan likhi ja rahi hai, tab rahul gandhi kii naagarikta ke sawaal par priyanka gandhi wadra yahi baat kah rahi hai
 He says, Rahul was born and lived in India - who can call him an outsider
 
 
 ?jo log akshay kumaar ko videshi nahin bataa paa rahe, ve rahul gandhi ko bataa rahe hai
 BJP MP Subrahmanyam Swamy complained to the Ministry of Home Affairs after the issue was returned from the Supreme Court and the Home Ministry sent a notice to Rahul Gandhi on the citizenship question
 lekin vichaar karne kii baat darasal duusari he
 The law of single citizenship is now outdated in India
 is kanoon ke mutabik koi vyakti agar duusare desh kii naagarikta le letaa he, to use bhartiya naagarikta chhodani padati he
 But because of this, many people are confused about the question of citizenship and are forced to give up their Indian citizenship despite not wanting
 in dinon bahut saare log hai, jo naukari ke silsile main duusare deshon main ja rahe hai
 Their offspring born there naturally become citizens of those countries
 agar unhen bhartiya bane rahanaa he, to vah naagarikta chhodani padati he
 It is not that we start treating Indians settled in other countries as alien
 pichley kuch varshon main pradhanmantri jin deshon main gaye, vahaan unhone bhartiya logon ko sambodhit kiya
 In many countries, the people of India remained behind the slogans of 'modi-modi'
 yah bhi sach he ki videshon main based bharatiyon ke liye kanuunan sahuliyatein dene kii maang bad rahi he
 The demand for voting rights for nris also arose during these days
 yani ek tarah se ekal naagarikta kanoon ke bandhan vaise hi kam ho rahe hai
 Certainly many important questions will arise regarding dual citizenship
 dohari naagarikta lekar kaarobaar yaa naukari karne vaale log kin deshon main kar denge yaa kis tarah kii nyaayik prakriyaaon se bandhe rahenge, lekin in sawaalon ke hal khoje ja sakate hai
 The important thing is that dual citizenship will expand our Indianness
 isse rashtrawaad kamazor nahin padegaa, kuch majboot hi hoga
 Currently, Prince Harry of the British royal family and his American wife Megan are going to have children
 use apane janm se hi dohari naagarikta mil jaaegi
 She will be born in Britain, but her mother is American, who is in the process of taking British citizenship, but who has not decided to give up her citizenship
 dohari naagarikta kaa aisa sweekaar hamaare yahaan bhi ho jaae, to bahut saare bhartiya apni naagarikta ganvaane ko majaboor nahin honge

 Describing the failure of detecting Osama bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad as Pakistan's intelligence failure, former President Pervez Musharraf admitted that ISI has crook elements
 unhone kaha ki sena ne alqaida pramukh ko chhavnee shahar main chhipane main madad kii hogi
 Musharraf, who is in self-exile in Britain, said that the rogue officers and military of the lower ranks of the powerful ISI must have known about bin Laden's whereabouts six years ago during the last one year of his presidency
 unhone kaha, vaaki yah bhayaavah he ki vah vahaan tha or kisi ko jaankaree nahin thi
 i am also afraid that i did not know and the intelligence people at that time did not know for six years that he was living there
 musharraf ne abisi news se kaha, is badi galati ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin he
 Investigation is on and people must be punished for this mistake
 unhone kaha ki niti ke mutabik sena or iesai alqaida or taliban sahit aatankwaad or charampanth se lard rahe hai

 He said, as i said, there is a possibility that some people at the lower level are running their policy and violating the above policies
 musharraf ne kaha ki koun kya jaanata he, is baat se pare tathy yah he ki america hamalaa pakistani samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan tha or unke kaarykaal ke dauraan aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua tha ki agar bin laden pakistan kii dharti par paaya gaya to america ko ekatarfa hamalaa karne kii anumati hogi
 Describing the Al Qaeda chief's stay in Abbottabad for six years as a big mistake on behalf of Pakistan's Intelligence Department, he warned the US that if the US kept Pakistan in the dark in bin Laden's case, doing so would harm America

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar muslim sanghathan jamaat islamic hind ne bada elaan kiya he
 Jamaat has once again hoped to form the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Gujarat
 dilli main yojit ek conference ke dauraan jamaat islamic hind ke adhyaksh saiyad jilaluddin umari ne kaha ki jis tarah kii khabaren aa rahi hai, usase lagata he ki ek baar phir bijepi kii sarkaar banegi
 He has also cited Opinion poll behind this
 haalanki, unka sanghathan kise samarthan karne ja rahaa he, ise lekar koi ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
 On the other hand, the organization has also made it clear that they do not think Muslims in Gujarat vote for BJP in large numbers
 rahul kaa asar nahinek taraf jahaan sanghathan ne bijepi kii sarkaar lautne kii ummid jataai, vahiin duusari taraf congress ko jhatka dene vaala bayaan bhi diya
 It was said in the conference that Rahul Gandhi is active about the Gujarat elections, but he is not able to make much impact
 samarthan dene par ab tak koi faisla nahinjamrit islamic hind ke adhyaksh saiyad jilaluddin se jab ye sawaal poocha gaya ki sanghathan kis party ko samarthan karne vaala he, is par unhone koi faisla na hone kii daleel di
 He said that it has not been decided who will support Jama'at in the Islamic elections
 haalanki, unhone ye bhi kaha ki sanghathan kii state cameti soobe main lagaataar kaam kar rahi he
 In fact, this statement of jamaat-islami Hind can be considered important because this organization has a wide impact in Gujarat
 yahaan tak ki gujarat kii chunavi raajnneeti main sanghathan kaaphi ahm role nibhaataa he
 On the other hand, this statement of the organization is also being seen as a pretext for Congress and Rahul Gandhi
 har vidhansabha chunaav main congress jamiyat ulema-e hind or jamaat islamic hind jaise majboot islamic sanghathanon ko bulaakar unka samarthan hasil karti ai he
 Prior to the elections, these organizations met and appealed for support
 lekin is baar aisa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Gujarati leaders of the party also believe that the Congress is moving towards soft Hindutva instead of focusing on Muslim voters
 yahi vajah he ki ab tak in sanghathanon ko party ne baatcheet ke liye nahin bulaayaa he
 Assembly elections are to be held in two phases in Gujarat
 pehle charan ke liye 9 disambar or duusare charan ke liye 14 disambar ko voting kii jaaegi
 While the result will be declared on 18 December

 fees:4,46,000seat:120 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and former Minister Kapil Mishra have come face-to-face once again for Yamuna Aarti
 jahaan ek ore kapil mishra ne is baar bhi yamuna aarti main hissaa liya, to duusari ore kejariwal ne isse kinaaraa kaata
 On this, Kapil Mishra lashed out at CM Kejriwal
 shanivaar ko dilli sarkaar main mantri rahe kapil mishra ne sonia vihaar ilaake main yamuna aarti kaa aayojan kiya
 Yamuna Aarti has been organized in Delhi for the last two years on Bhaiya Dooj
 dilli shahar main yamuna nadi bahut pradooshit he, aise menruth parvake najadik aate hi jis tarah se yamuna kii safai kii baat kii jaati he, usamen kahin na kahin rajanetaaon kii vot bank kii raajnneeti najar aa rahi he
 Last year, the entire cabinet of the Delhi government was present on the event of Yamunarati at Sonia Vihar
 haalanki is baar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal na to kudasia ghat or na hi sonia vihaar kii aarti main shaamil hue yani jahaan aapkaa vot bank he, vahaan ke alaava mukhyamantri sahab ne kahin bhi janaa munasib nahin samajha
 The Lt
 Governor performed Yamuna Aarti at Kudsia Ghat in Delhi
 is maukey par dilli sarkaar ke purv mantri kapil mishra ne elaan kiya ki yamuna safai ke liye kiye gaye tamaam vaayade oktober tak shuru nahin kiye gaye, to purvi dilli ke ilaakon main khaskar karaval nagar, sonia vihaar, bhajanpura or ghonda kii janata ko saath main lekar vah dilli ke maalik kejariwal ke yahaan pradarshan karenge
 With this, Kapil Mishra told the people of his assembly that the Yamuna love of Arvind Kejriwal has now ended
 isliye wo yamuna paar kii janata se bhedbhaav kar rahe hai
 In this way, Kapil Mishra said that somewhere after October, politics will be done in the city of Delhi in view of Yamuna, why the signature bridge since 1998 has not been built yet? After all, why has the Yamuna river, which has been continuously getting dirty for the last 25 years, turning into a drain till now? ek bayaan main unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘pradhanmantri modi sahi kah rahe hai ki rajeev gandhi bhrashtachari number ek the, lekin ve bharat ke sabase bade mob linchar bhi the
 Sirsa alleged that Gandhi not only encouraged the genocide against the Sikhs, but also protected and rewarded those involved
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apane divangat pita rajeev gandhi ke bare main pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara ‘bhrashtachari number 1' kaa tanj kase jane par ravivaar ko ‘pyaar or jhappi ke saath' unhen jawaab dete hue kaha ki aapke karm aapkaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Gandhi said that Modi is imposing his perception about himself on my father but he will not be able to save himself as the fight is over for him
 modi kii tippanee kii congress or anya vipakshi netaaon ne kadi ninda kii he jinka maananaa he ki pradhanmantri ne ek aise purv pradhanmantri, jo is duniya main nahin he, ke bare main aisi tippanee kar apane pad kii maryaada giraayi he
 But the BJP said that every word that Modi has said about Rajiv Gandhi is correct and that the Congress chief is nervous about the possible defeat of his party in the Lok Sabha elections
 maharashtra navnirmaan sena (manase) ke pramukh raaj thakare ne ravivaar ko ninda kii or kaha ki desh is bayaan ke liye unhen maaf nahin karegaa
 Thackeray tweeted, 'hatred, endless lies and no regrets for transcending public life are three things that have become the identity of Narendra Modi
 yah divangat pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf unke naveenatam bayanon se or tej hua he
 The nation will not forgive them at all

 So far, a total of 48 people have been arrested from all three districts in this connection
 hindu sanghathanon ne kathith rup se aarope lagaaya he ki isai log dharm parivartan karaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 At the same time, they are making false propaganda against the Hindu deities
 inhone pehle in maamalon ko shantipurna tareeke se nipataane kii koshish kii, lekin isaayiyon ke nahin samajhane ke baad maamle ko apane haath main liya
 Till now dozens of people have been injured in the protests and clashes of these protesting religious organizations and the loss of a good president
 rajasthan main bhale hi hameshaa se bhartiya janata party yaa congress kaa netaa mukhyamantri banataa rahaa ho, lekin pradesh kii raajnneeti main nirdaleeyon kaa khaas yogadan rahaa he
 For the first time after India's independence, when elections were held in Rajasthan, the names of many independents were among the winning leaders
 kai baar to nirdaleeyon kii vajah se hi sarkaar bani he or is baar bhi nidarleey netaa teesraa morcha banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The matter is in the year 1993, when assembly elections were being held in Rajasthan after almost one year of President's rule
 isse pehle bhairon singh shekhavat do baar se pradesh ke mukhyamantri the
 On 15 December 1992, the Chief Minister's chair was vacated
 disambar 1993 main hue chunaav main bijepi ne congress se 0
 Gained 33% more votes
 us vakt bijepi ko 38
 60% and 38 to Congress
 27% vot mili the
 During that time 21 independents had won and with the help of independents, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat formed the government
 saal 2008 main bhi congress ko 36
 82% and BJP 34
 27% vot mili the
 At that time Congress formed government with independents
 isliye pradesh main hameshaa se nirdaleeyon ne kai siton par kabja kiya he
 At the same time, Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal is in the fray with the third front
 haalanki pradesh kii raajnneeti main duusare ummidavaaron kaa khel bigaadane vaale nirdaleeyon kii sankhya main lagaataar kami najar aa rahi he

 Congress election manager Prashant Kishore's meeting with SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday is a big step towards becoming a grand alliance
 upi main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle samaajawaadee party or congress sahit samaan vichaardhaara vaale siyaasi dalon ke is gathjod se bijepi or basapa ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In the province, the ruling Samajwadi Party is trying hard to overcome the infighting within its family and to keep its vote bank from slipping away
 sapa ne iske liye nitish kumaar kii jadyu, lalu yadav kii argedy or ajit singh kii areldi se sampark kiya he
 The Congress has some Dalit votes and some forward votes
 isamen gaiyr jatav dalit jatiyaan or kuch agade aate hai
 The Mahagathbandhan will at least divide the votes of minority votes
 bispi is baar apane paramparaagat dalit votaron ke alaava alpsankhyak votaron par bhi najar gadaaye hue hai
 If Muslims get the option of a strong grand alliance then minority voters will like to return to Netaji's court
 nitish kumaar ke paas ati pichde samudaay kevotaron ko rijhaaneka damakham he to 9 fisadi yadav or 18 fisadi muslim vot upi main mulaayam singh yadav kii takat he
 If the SP chief is able to form an anti-bjp alliance, then the BJP cannot get the benefit of his family's split in the elections to be held early next year
 ajit singh jaaton ke kuch vot jod sakate hai jo kai siton par jeet ke liye nirnaayak ho saktaa he
 If Ajit Singh becomes a part of the mahagathbandhan, then Jat voters will gain strength in the Janadhar, especially in western Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP had made a dent in the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main bijepi kii prachand jeet ke baad 2014 main samaajawaadee party, argedy, jediu, jedies, inelo or samaajawaadee party ko milakar grand alliance banane kii koshish hui thi
 But this alliance broke down before the Bihar elections
 agar is baar yah gathjod kaamyaab rahaa to aane vaale aam chunaav ke lihaaj se bijepi virdohi netaaon ke liye badi jeet hogi jo piem banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 Last year, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ban on demonetisation, the line outside atms had started coming in from late night
 duusare din yah line atm ke alaava bainkon ke baahar bhi lagane lagi
 But there were many people who did not find themselves on the line, but they hired 'chhotu' for this work
 ek starop kaa jugad'chotu' ko linepar lagaakar log apane duusare kaam nipataate or line main ghanton khadey hone kii takalif se bhi bachate
 By putting 'chhotu' on the line, while the common people saved their hours, on the other hand, a startup earned lakhs of rupees from this jugaad
 inhone bhunaaya notebandi coline main lagane ke liye 'chotu'ko kiraaye par dene kaa jugad 'book maay chotu' starop kaa tha
 During the demonetisation last year, this startup increased its business manifold with this jugaad
 unhone logon ko line main lagane ke liye ' chotu' muhaiyaa kararak na sirf acchhee kamai kii, balki kaaphi shauharat bhi hasil kii
 This is how ideabook My Chhotoo founder and CEO Satjit Singh Bedi did Aajtak
 in se baatcheet main bataaya ki notebandi ke dauraan kai log line main khadaa nahin hona chaahate the
 His standing job was being affected due to standing in line
 aise logon kii madad ke liye hi book maay chotu ne 'chotu' ko kiraaye par lene kaa vikalp diya
 Relieved people, Sajjit said that we usually provide housekeeping boy service
 notebandi ke dauraan hamane in logon ko line main lagakar kamai karne kaa mauka diya
 We started providing boys to get people in line for just Rs 90
 iskaa phayda ye hua ki log apana kaam nipataate or ye ladke line main rahakar unka bhaar kam karte
 Demonetisation increased business, says Satjit, that demonetisation played an important role in increasing their business
 unhone bataaya ki notebandi se pehle jahaan unke paas 40 se 50 fisadi booking hoti thi
 During the demonetisation, this booking reached 90 to 95 per cent and these bookings were being done only to be installed in ATM and bank lines
 isse starop ko na sirf aay ke maamle main phayda hua, balki yah ratorat femes bhi ho gai
 This made the marketing cost of the company zero
 ek saal baad ye he starop kaa halanotbandi ke dauraan apane jugad se ratorat chamakane vaale 'book maay chotu' kii chamak ek saal baad bhi kam nahin hui he
 Govin Kandhari, the startup's core team and head of strategy, says that over the past year, our startup has grown 10 times and now we have more people involved
 hamaari booking main bhi teji ai he
 Focusing on expanding the scope, the startup got so much fame and fame that now Satjit is also preparing to take his business out of delhi-ncr
 iske liye vah frenchiji model laane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, taaki desh ke anya rajyon main bhi logon ko vah suvidha de saken
 Now, 'chhotu' of startups who are on the line here says that after demonetisation, people are now renting their 'chhotu' in hospitals, banks and many other places to line up
 vah bataate hai ki ham aam logon ko ghanton ke hisaab se housakiping bvoij kiraaye par dete hai
 He explains that you have a wedding in your home and you want help in settling something, with Book My Chhotu, you can hire boys for hours and get your work done

 com / ldgnycw0xs BJP mps have been given the responsibility to tell people about the 4-year achievements of the Modi government
 ujjain ke saansad chintamani malviya ne isi kadi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko unnisvin sadi main france ke samraat rahe nepolian bonapart se bhi ‘bada jaadugar’ bataa daalaa
 During the press conference in Ratlam, MP Malviya started praising achievements during the 4-year tenure of the Modi government, and made a strange comment about India's relationship with foreign countries
 malviya ne kaha, “nepolian ke bare main kaha jaataa tha ki wo teen deshon se kheltaa tha
 It was also said that he is a magician playing with three balls, out of which two balls were always in his hand and one in the air
 wo teen deshon ko is tarah ghumata tha
 Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a bigger magician than that
 chaahe vah america ho yaa britain, rus ho yaa china, israel or japan ho, jitne bhi mahatvapurn desh hai, sab se aaj hamaare dostana sambandh he, or hamaari sharton par sambandh he
 We know that Prime Minister Modi got a standing ovation 40 times in the UK Parliament
 ek vishwa netaa ke taur par desh kaa sammaan badha he
 Malaviya did not stop here
 unhone sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko ginate hue isro kii ore se ek saath chode gaye 104 satellites ke record kaa bhi hawala diya
 Malaviya said that these satellites were left as if a school bus leaves the children
 iske alaava malviya ne uplabdhiyon main 5000 kilometre tak maarak kshamta rakhane vaali agni 5 missile kaa hawala diya
 Malaviya said that this government has done a loan of Rs 11 lakh crore in the field of agriculture

 is jeet main karnataka ke dipti siem ashwathanarayan kaa bhi bada yogadan rahaa
 The victory of BJP candidate Narayan Gowda from KR Pete also matters because it has been considered a JDS stronghold
 mandya jila vokkalinga bahulya kshetra he or jedies ke netaa deveguda or echdi kumaraswami bhi isi samudaay se aate hai
 At the same time, Yeddyurappa, coming from the Lingayat community, had so much connection with the region that his roots are connected here
 yediurppa ne yaheen se shimoga ke shikaripura main shift hokar vahaan apana raajnneetik aadhaar banaaya
 This fact became a ray of hope for Yeddyurappa's son Vijayendra and he did not hesitate to become BJP in-charge in KR Pete assembly constituency

 vijayendra ne jab keaar pete kaa rukh kiya to vahaan paaya ki 258 pole booths main se 200 main party kaa koi booth sadsy nahin tha
 In such a situation, according to 10 members at each booth, BJP urgently needed 2000 loyalists
 vijayendra ne kaha, ‘jab main keaar pete gaya to maine mahasoos kiya ki vahaan hamaare paas 200 booth par saport staff nahin he
 The immediate staff was to be found and trended
 hamane samaan soch vaale log or party ke shubhachintak dhunde’
 What was the strategy? Vijayendra described KR Pete's voters as having an emotional relationship with the Yeddyurappa family's roots in the region
 bijepi ne yahaan jati card par jor dene kii jagah vikaas par jor diya
 The strategy was simple - to remind people what Yeddyurappa had done for his constituency in 2008 as CM
 doodh par sabsidi ko chaar rupee badhaayaa or 108 ambulance seva shuru kii jisase gramin sector ko madad mili’
 The message to the voters of KR Pete was clear that if BJP wins from here, Chief Minister Yeddyurappa will reverse the picture here
 vijayendra ne kaha, ‘mandya ne kabhi bijepi vidhayak yaa saansad nahin dekha tha
 When we went there we did not see any kind of development there
 gaanvon main samuchit sadaken or sampark naa dekhakar ham hairaan the
 Despite not having a BJP representative in the area, Yeddyurappa released a fund of 850 crore '
 bijepi ne is kshetra main devegoda or kumaraswami par sidhe hamale se bhi parhez kiya
 KR Pete has 96,000 Vokkalinga and 16,000 Lingayat voters
 isaki jagah bijepi ne dhyaan dilaayaa ki kis tarah se yediurppa kii vajah se vokkalinga samudaay se aane vaale kumaraswami pehali baar karnataka main siem bane, sadanand gauda siem bane, aar ashok dipti siem bane
 According to Vijayendra, the major reason for bjp's victory in this area was also that the opposition took us lightly, considering it as their stronghold, they had thought that BJP cannot win from here

 Charminar was built in the year 1591 by Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth king of the Qutb Shahi dynasty

 It has four minarets on which it is named
 kyon khaas he charminar:yah imaarat musee nadi ke purvi tat par sthit he
 Many theories have emerged as to why Charminar was formed
 lekin aamtaur par yah mana jaataa he ki haija khatm hone ke baad ise shahar ke bichombich banaaya gaya tha
 Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah had prayed for the eradication of the disease and vowed that he would build a mosque at the place where he prayed

 Wow, Daddy
 
 You have changed a lot

 This ratio is rarely found in any university in India

 We also see the report sent by our colleague Dinesh Mansera
 dinesh ke mutabik yahaan 4500 chaatr padhate hai jabaki website par likhaa he ki 2800 se 3000 padhate hai
 The number of teachers that the teacher union president has told is quite different from that given on the website

 The condition of the students is that they are celebrating the democracy of India on Facebook, cannot come on camera and speak a line on the condition of their university because we all have accepted that the name will be cut from the school college by speaking or the leader Will send prison itani badi uniwarsity main chaatr sangh nahin he

 sansaadhan kii kami ke kaaran
 Recently Rahul Gandhi hugged a professor Ranjana Awasthi in his town hall
 congress kaa video he, hamaara nahin he, pehle aap suniye sanskrit kii professor ranjana avasthi kya kah rahi hai
 Have tried to talk separately with us but did not get success, fear has made people in such a condition
 ahmedabad ke enbi patel college main 22 saal tak sanskrit padhaane ke baad ranjana avasthi kii selary 12000 hui
 Can you tell me any one job in any university in the world where after 22 years of work, the salary of a professor is 12000
 yah udaahan sirf gujarat kaa nahin he, bihar, madhya pradesh se lekar dilli uniwarsity tak kaa he
 Think salary 12000 after 22 years of job
 is shoshan ke baad bhi hamaari raajnneeti main bhavuk mudde hi chalate hai
 Just like Adhawk happens in Delhi University, Guest Teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called Guest Scholar, similarly new term is used from time to time for temporary jobs in Gujarat
 vahaan ke shikshakon se baat karne par do tarah ke permanent kaa pataa chalaa
 Full time permanent and part time permanent
 maine pehali baar part time permanent suna he
 Blunder Mistake looks like a return back, part time permanent
 niyukti patr main part time hi likhaa hota he magar ek hi college main part time padhaate-padhaate ve khud ko part time permanent kehane lagate hai
 All these examples show that if the government wants, then people can get their work done without any money and people will do the work
 hamane dinesh ke shah se baat kii, dinesh bhai ne 35 saal tak part time permanent teacher ke taur par padhaate rahe
 He taught part time at the same college from 1980 to 2015
 1980 main 2500 kii selary par jwine kiya tha
 12000 when he retired in 2015
 dinesh bhai ne ek hi college main kanoon padhaayaa
 After 35 years, Dinesh Bhai came out of college and he had nothing in his hands
 na pension na koi saamaajik suraksha
 In 1998, part time and adhoc appointments were banned in Gujarat
 300 part time teacher batch gaye hai
 All of them have been teaching for twenty years
 chah maheenaa pehle faisla hua he ki jinaki piechdi he unhen 40,000 vetan milegaa magar pehle na bakaayaa milegaa na baaki koi suvidha
 We spoke on the phone to a teacher teaching Adhoc in Gujarat
 unhone bataaya ki 2009 main kareeb 200 edock shikshakon ko sthaayee kiya gaya tha
 Many of them were teaching in colleges for ten to 15 years
 sthaayee hone se selary to bad gai magar pichhlaa bakaayaa kuch nahin mila
 Adhoc teachers are now being replaced
 inaki selary bhi fiks he, har saal nahin badhegi
 The salary of assistant teacher was increased to 40,000
 hamaare paas gujarat ke collejon main chaatro or shikshakon kii sankhya kii jaankaree nahin he
 If this information were there, how many students are there in which college, how many teachers are there, then the picture would have been more clear
 teen shikshakon se baat kar likhaa he, agar kuch galat he to vahaan ke shiksha mantri bayaan de sakate hai, ham zarur dikhaaenge
 Meanwhile, the Rajasthan government has taken a major revolutionary step in the field of education
 chaatr padhai main bhale zero rah jaaen magar deshbhakti main peeche na rahe iske liye rajasthan sarkaar ne 800 hostel main har din raashtragan gane kaa farmaan jari kar diya he
 There will be a national anthem at 7 am
 aapane uniwarsity series main aapane dekha ki rajasthan ke college ke college main shikshakon kii bhayanak kami he
 After the national anthem, what will they do when the students from the hostel arrive in the class and do not get teachers, i think whenever there is no teacher for any class, that class should also have a national anthem
 chaatr hi shikshak he tip ke naare se bhi chaatro kaa dhyaan hataaya ja saktaa he
 ndtv
 in kii site par puri uniwarsity series kaa link he aap dekh sakate hai
 The comments yah tasviir un shikshakon or chaatro kii he jo 500 kilometre chalakar mumbai main press conference karne aae hai
 So that the government sitting there can see them or the media there can convey their point to the government
 ye sabhi konkan ilaake ke chaatr or shikshak hai
 There are 103 colleges in Konkan which are affiliated to Mumbai University
 inaki maang he ki konkan ke liye alag se vishvavidhyalay hona chahie, 500 kimi kii duuri dekhte hue yah maang uchit bhi lagati he
 Students and teachers have to travel 500 km for small tasks
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra lagaataar mumbai uniwarsity kii pariksha main hui gadabadi ko lekar report kar rahe hai
 a private company was contracted to check the copy there
 sohit ko artiai kaaryakarta ne bataaya he ki us company ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiye gaye
 The company says that the rules were followed, Sohit asked the Education Minister for an answer, but refused to answer

 In 1998, part time and adhoc appointments were banned in Gujarat
 300 part time teacher batch gaye hai
 All of them have been teaching for twenty years
 chah maheenaa pehle faisla hua he ki jinaki piechdi he unhen 40,000 vetan milegaa magar pehle na bakaayaa milegaa na baaki koi suvidha
 We spoke on the phone to a teacher teaching Adhoc in Gujarat
 unhone bataaya ki 2009 main kareeb 200 edock shikshakon ko sthaayee kiya gaya tha
 Many of them were teaching in colleges for ten to 15 years
 sthaayee hone se selary to bad gai magar pichhlaa bakaayaa kuch nahin mila
 Adhoc teachers are now being replaced
 inaki selary bhi fiks he, har saal nahin badhegi
 The salary of assistant teacher was increased to 40,000
 hamaare paas gujarat ke collejon main chaatro or shikshakon kii sankhya kii jaankaree nahin he
 If this information were there, how many students are there in which college, how many teachers are there, then the picture would have been more clear
 teen shikshakon se baat kar likhaa he, agar kuch galat he to vahaan ke shiksha mantri bayaan de sakate hai, ham zarur dikhaaenge
 Meanwhile, the Rajasthan government has taken a major revolutionary step in the field of education
 chaatr padhai main bhale zero rah jaaen magar deshbhakti main peeche na rahe iske liye rajasthan sarkaar ne 800 hostel main har din raashtragan gane kaa farmaan jari kar diya he
 There will be a national anthem at 7 am
 aapane uniwarsity series main aapane dekha ki rajasthan ke college ke college main shikshakon kii bhayanak kami he
 After the national anthem, what will they do when the students from the hostel arrive in the class and do not get teachers, i think whenever there is no teacher for any class, that class should also have a national anthem
 chaatr hi shikshak he tip ke naare se bhi chaatro kaa dhyaan hataaya ja saktaa he
 ndtv
 in kii site par puri uniwarsity series kaa link he aap dekh sakate hai
 The comments yah tasviir un shikshakon or chaatro kii he jo 500 kilometre chalakar mumbai main press conference karne aae hai
 So that the government sitting there can see them or the media there can convey their point to the government
 ye sabhi konkan ilaake ke chaatr or shikshak hai
 There are 103 colleges in Konkan which are affiliated to Mumbai University
 inaki maang he ki konkan ke liye alag se vishvavidhyalay hona chahie, 500 kimi kii duuri dekhte hue yah maang uchit bhi lagati he
 Students and teachers have to travel 500 km for small tasks
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra lagaataar mumbai uniwarsity kii pariksha main hui gadabadi ko lekar report kar rahe hai
 a private company was contracted to check the copy there
 sohit ko artiai kaaryakarta ne bataaya he ki us company ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiye gaye
 The company says that the rules were followed, Sohit asked the Education Minister for an answer, but refused to answer
 bharat or america kii yah saajhedaari itani kaamyaab rahi ki isse puure desh main 31 anya krishi vishvavidlaay kaayam hue
 Its students dominate the world of agriculture
 america main jab clinton raashtrapati the tab unke krishi mantralay ke dipti secetry islam siddiki isi uniwarsity ke chaatr the
 The campus of the university is so big that it has a network of roads, a colony, a hospital, a marketplace, 6 primary schools, 3 secondary schools
 uttarakhand ke udhamsingh nagar main yah vishvavidhyalay aapako mil jayega
 It has written on the university website that there are 763 teachers, besides 59 technical staff and the rest are 2878 employees
 2800-3000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 a teacher has an average of 6 students
 ham chaunk gaye ki ek shikshak par sirf chah chaatr
 This ratio is rarely found in any university in India
 uniwarsity series main aapane dekha hi ki kai jagahon par ek shikshak par 500 se 1200 chaatro kaa anupaat he
 We also see the report sent by our colleague Dinesh Mansera
 dinesh ke mutabik yahaan 4500 chaatr padhate hai jabaki website par likhaa he ki 2800 se 3000 padhate hai
 The number of teachers that the teacher union president has told is quite different from that given on the website
 haa kai saal se kareeb dau sau shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 More than two and a half thousand employees have vacancies
 inamen lab karmchaaree, staff, duusare sahaayak pad shaamil hai
 Many posts have been said to be empty here for twenty years
 1959 main kis sapane se is vishvavidhyalay ko banaaya gaya or 2017 main aap is sapane kaa khandhar dekh rahe hai
 You will not hear this in any leader's speech
 bhaashanon kaa bhi ajeeb haal he
 Rallies are organized by spending millions of crores of rupees so that a leader can describe himself as poor
 isse badi vidambnaa kya ho sakati he
 Pant Nagar University has 14 research colleges
 9 zilon main iske iske shodh santhaan faile hue hai
 But there is dirty water in the hostels here, toilets are broken, walls are damp and complaints of bad food are common
 ek or baat pataa chali ki ek baje se teen baje kaa lunch time hota he is dauraan kai kaam band ho jate hai
 The condition of the students is that they are celebrating the democracy of India on Facebook, cannot come on camera and speak a line on the condition of their university because we all have accepted that the name will be cut from the school college by speaking or the leader Will send prison itani badi uniwarsity main chaatr sangh nahin he
 The reality is known, but when you say it, make it so light that it should be talked about and not even talked about
 vaais chancelar sahab khud hi kah rahe hai ki ham kahin nahin thaharte
 Everyone's tongue has been ranked
 chakma dene kaa yah nayaa shigupha he
 Soon the colleges of the district will start ranking and people will be happy in that
 miss world ke saath yahi hua tha, miss nainital or miss rohtak bhi hone laga he
 Dinesh Mansera has stated that there has been no permanent Vice Chancellor for the last seven years
 jis vishwa vidlaalay se kheti par shodh hona he, kheti ke liye visheshgy paidaa hone hai uskaa ye haal he
 The income from the slogan itself will double
 karmchaaree sangh pension ko lekar bhi pareshaan he
 For 30-30 years, part of the pension has been deducted and has been fighting to get it
 sarkaar kahati he ki hamane apana hissaa de diya he or ab uniwarsity baaki fund khud jutaaye
 Not only this, in 2002, the Uttarakhand government took 3339 acres of land of Pant Nagar University Agricultural Form and made it an industrial area
 dinesh mansera ko sutron ne bataaya ki yahaan to manmohan singh sarkaar ke krishi mantri or na hi modi sarkaar ke krishi mantri ne kadam rakhaa he
 We could not cover Gujarat or many other states in the University Series
 sansaadhan kii kami ke kaaran
 Recently Rahul Gandhi hugged a professor Ranjana Awasthi in his town hall
 congress kaa video he, hamaara nahin he, pehle aap suniye sanskrit kii professor ranjana avasthi kya kah rahi hai
 Have tried to talk separately with us but did not get success, fear has made people in such a condition
 ahmedabad ke enbi patel college main 22 saal tak sanskrit padhaane ke baad ranjana avasthi kii selary 12000 hui
 Can you tell me any one job in any university in the world where after 22 years of work, the salary of a professor is 12000
 yah udaahan sirf gujarat kaa nahin he, bihar, madhya pradesh se lekar dilli uniwarsity tak kaa he
 Think salary 12000 after 22 years of job
 is shoshan ke baad bhi hamaari raajnneeti main bhavuk mudde hi chalate hai
 Just like Adhawk happens in Delhi University, Guest Teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called Guest Scholar, similarly new term is used from time to time for temporary jobs in Gujarat
 vahaan ke shikshakon se baat karne par do tarah ke permanent kaa pataa chalaa
 Full time permanent and part time permanent
 maine pehali baar part time permanent suna he
 Blunder Mistake looks like a return back, part time permanent
 niyukti patr main part time hi likhaa hota he magar ek hi college main part time padhaate-padhaate ve khud ko part time permanent kehane lagate hai
 All these examples show that if the government wants, then people can get their work done without any money and people will do the work
 hamane dinesh ke shah se baat kii, dinesh bhai ne 35 saal tak part time permanent teacher ke taur par padhaate rahe
 He taught part time at the same college from 1980 to 2015
 1980 main 2500 kii selary par jwine kiya tha
 12000 when he retired in 2015
 dinesh bhai ne ek hi college main kanoon padhaayaa
 After 35 years, Dinesh Bhai came out of college and he had nothing in his hands

 uniwarsity kii website par likhaa he ki yahaan 763 shikshak hai, iske alaava 59 technical staff hai or baaki sab milakar 2878 karmchaaree hai
 2800–3000 students study here
 ek shikshak par 6 chaatro kaa ausat he
 We were shocked that just six students on one teacher
 bharat kii kisi bhi uniwarsity main yah anupaat shaayad hi mili
 You have seen in the university series that in many places there is a ratio of 500 to 1200 students on one teacher
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne jo report bheji he ham vah bhi dekh lete hai
 According to Dinesh, 4500 students study here whereas on the website it is written that 2800 to 3000 are read
 shikshak sangh ke adhyaksh ne jo shikshakon kii sankhya bataai he wo website par di gai usase kaaphi alag he
 Yes, there have been vacancies of about two hundred teachers for many years
 dhai hazaar se zyaada karmchaariyon ke pad khaali hai
 These include lab staff, staff, other assistant positions
 kai pad to yahaan bees-bees saal se khaali bataae gaye hai
 With which dream was this university built in 1959 and in 2017 you are seeing the ruins of this dream
 ye baat aap kisi netaa ke bhaashan main nahin sunenge
 Speeches are also strange
 lakhon karodon rupee karch kar reliyaan yojit kii jaati hai taaki koi netaa khud ko garib bataa sake
 What can be more ironic than this
 pant nagar uniwarsity main 14 shodh college chalate hai
 Its research institutes are spread across 9 districts
 magar yahaan ke hostalon main ganda pani aata he, shauchalay toote phute hai, sillen bhari deevaaren hai or karaab khaane kii shikaayat to aam baat he
 One more thing came to know that there is a lunch time of one o'clock to three o'clock, during which many works are stopped
 chaatro kii haalat yah he ki ve fasebuk par hi india kii demokrasi celibratt kar rahe hai, camere par aakar apni uniwarsity kii haalat par ek line nahin bol sakate kyonki ham sabane sweekaar kar liya he ki bol dene se skool college se naam cat jayega yaa netaa jail bhijwa degaa
 There is no student union in such a large university
 hakeekat maaloom he magar kehete samay use itnaa halkaa kar do ki baat bhi ho jaae or lage bhi na ki baat kii gai he
 The Vice Chancellor himself is saying that we do not stay anywhere
 sabaki jubaan par ranking aa gai he
 This is the new Shiguafa to dodge
 jaldi hi zile ke collejon kii rekking hone lagegi or usee main log khush rahenge
 The same thing happened with Miss World, Miss Nainital and Miss Rohtak have also started happening
 dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki pichley saat saal se koi sthaayee vaais chancelar nahin rahaa
 This is the situation of the world school from which research is to be conducted on agriculture, experts are born for farming
 slogan se hi aamadani dugani ho jaaegi lagata he
 The employees union is also worried about the pension
 30-30 saal se pension kaa hissaa katwate rahe or use paane ke liye ladate phir rahe hai
 The government says that we have given our share and now the university has raised the remaining funds itself
 yahi nahin 2002 main uttarakhand sarkaar ne pant nagar uniwarsity krishi form kii 3339 acre zamin lekar vahaan audyogic kshetra bana daalaa
 Sources told Dinesh Mansera that neither the Agriculture Minister of the Manmohan Singh Government nor the Agriculture Minister of the Modi Government have stepped here
 uniwarsity series main ham gujarat yaa kai anya rajya cover nahin kar paae
 Due to resource constraints
 haal hi main rahul gandhi ne apane toun haul main ek professor ranjana avasthi ko gale laga liya
 There is a video of the Congress, not ours, first you hear what Sanskrit professor Ranjana Awasthi is saying
 koshish kii he ki hamaare saath alag se baat ho jaae magar safalataa nahin mili, dar ne logon kii aisi haalat kar di he
 Ranjana Awasthi's salary was 12000 after teaching Sanskrit for 22 years at NB Patel College, Ahmedabad
 kya aap duniya ke kisi bhi uniwarsity main koi ek naukari bataa sakate hai jahaan 22 saal kaam karne ke baad professor kii tankhwaah 12000 hoti he
 This example is not only from Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh to Delhi University
 sochie 22 saal kii naukari ke baad tankhwaah 12000
 Even after this exploitation, emotional issues continue in our politics
 jaise dilli uniwarsity main edock hota he, madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kehete hai usee tarah gujarat main asthai naukariyon ke liye samay samay par nai shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 After talking to the teachers there, two types of permutations were found
 phul time permanent or part time permanent
 i heard Part Time Permanent for the first time
 blendar mistek, ritern back jaisaa lagata he part time permanent
 Part time is written in the appointment letter, but while teaching part time in the same college, they start calling themselves part time permanent
 ye sab udhaaharan bataate hai ki agar sarkaar chaahe to logon se bina paise hi zindagi bhar kaam kara sakati he or log kaam bhi kar lenge
 We talked to Shah of Dinesh, Dinesh Bhai continued to teach as part time permanent teacher for 35 years
 ek hi college main 1980 se 2015 tak part time padhaate rahe
 i joined a salary of 2500 in 1980
 2015 main ritair hue to selary hui 12000
 Dinesh Bhai taught law in the same college
 35 saal baad dinesh bhai college se nikle to unke haath main kuch nahin tha
 Neither pension nor any social security
 gujarat main 1998 main part time or edock niyuktiyon par roak laga di
 300 part time teachers have survived
 ye sabhi bees-bees saal se padhaa rahe hai
 Six months ago, it has been decided that those who have phd will get 40,000 salary but neither will get the arrears nor any other facility
 gujarat main edock padhaa rahe ek shikshak se hamane phone par baat kii
 He said that in 2009, about 200 adhoc teachers were made permanent
 inamen se kai das se 15 saal se collejon main padhaa rahe the
 Due to permanent, salary increased but the previous dues were not received
 edock kii jagah ab sahaayak shikshak rakhe jane lage hai
 His salary is also fixed, will not increase every year
 sahaayak shikshak kii selary 40,000 kar di gai
 We do not have information on the number of students and teachers in colleges in Gujarat
 agar ye jaankaree hoti to kis college main kitne chaatr hai, kitne shikshak hai to tasviir or saaf hoti
 It is written by talking to three teachers, if something is wrong, the education minister can give a statement, we will definitely show it
 is bich shiksha ke kshetra main rajasthan sarkaar ne ek bada krantikari kadam uthaaya he
 The students may remain zero in studies but do not lag behind in patriotism, so that the Rajasthan government has issued a decree to sing the national anthem every day in 800 hostels
 subah 7 baje raashtragan hoga
 You saw in the University Series that there is a terrible shortage of teachers in the college of Rajasthan
 raashtragan ke baad hostel se chaatr jab class main pahunchenge or shikshak nahin milenge tab ve kya karenge, mere khyaal se jab bhi kisi class ke liye teacher na hon us class main bhi raashtragan hona chahie
 Students can be diverted by the slogan of the type that is the teacher
 ndtv
 You can see a link to the entire university series on the site of in
 tippaniyan This picture is of those teachers and students who have come to Mumbai for 500 km to hold a press conference
 taaki vahaan baithi sarkaar unhen dekh le yaa vahaan kaa media unki baat ko sarkaar tak pahunchaa sake
 All of them are students and teachers of the Konkan region
 konkan main 103 college hai jo mumbai uniwarsity se jude hai
 They demand that there should be a separate university for Konkan, given the distance of 500 km, this demand also seems reasonable
 chote-chote kaam ke liye chaatro or shikshakon ko 500 kimi kii yatra kerani padati he
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra is continuously reporting about the disturbances in the examination of Mumbai University
 vahaan copy jaanchane ke liye ek privet company ko theka diya gaya tha
 Sohit is told by an RTI activist that changes were made to the rules for that company

 Think salary 12000 after 22 years of job
 is shoshan ke baad bhi hamaari raajnneeti main bhavuk mudde hi chalate hai
 Just like Adhawk happens in Delhi University, Guest Teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called Guest Scholar, similarly new term is used from time to time for temporary jobs in Gujarat
 vahaan ke shikshakon se baat karne par do tarah ke permanent kaa pataa chalaa
 Full time permanent and part time permanent
 maine pehali baar part time permanent suna he
 Blunder Mistake looks like a return back, part time permanent
 niyukti patr main part time hi likhaa hota he magar ek hi college main part time padhaate-padhaate ve khud ko part time permanent kehane lagate hai
 All these examples show that if the government wants, then people can get their work done without any money and people will do the work
 hamane dinesh ke shah se baat kii, dinesh bhai ne 35 saal tak part time permanent teacher ke taur par padhaate rahe
 He taught part time at the same college from 1980 to 2015
 1980 main 2500 kii selary par jwine kiya tha
 12000 when he retired in 2015
 dinesh bhai ne ek hi college main kanoon padhaayaa
 After 35 years, Dinesh Bhai came out of college and he had nothing in his hands
 na pension na koi saamaajik suraksha
 In 1998, part time and adhoc appointments were banned in Gujarat
 300 part time teacher batch gaye hai
 All of them have been teaching for twenty years
 chah maheenaa pehle faisla hua he ki jinaki piechdi he unhen 40,000 vetan milegaa magar pehle na bakaayaa milegaa na baaki koi suvidha
 We spoke on the phone to a teacher teaching Adhoc in Gujarat
 unhone bataaya ki 2009 main kareeb 200 edock shikshakon ko sthaayee kiya gaya tha
 Many of them were teaching in colleges for ten to 15 years
 sthaayee hone se selary to bad gai magar pichhlaa bakaayaa kuch nahin mila
 Adhoc teachers are now being replaced
 inaki selary bhi fiks he, har saal nahin badhegi
 The salary of assistant teacher was increased to 40,000
 hamaare paas gujarat ke collejon main chaatro or shikshakon kii sankhya kii jaankaree nahin he
 If this information were there, how many students are there in which college, how many teachers are there, then the picture would have been more clear
 teen shikshakon se baat kar likhaa he, agar kuch galat he to vahaan ke shiksha mantri bayaan de sakate hai, ham zarur dikhaaenge
 Meanwhile, the Rajasthan government has taken a major revolutionary step in the field of education
 chaatr padhai main bhale zero rah jaaen magar deshbhakti main peeche na rahe iske liye rajasthan sarkaar ne 800 hostel main har din raashtragan gane kaa farmaan jari kar diya he
 There will be a national anthem at 7 am
 aapane uniwarsity series main aapane dekha ki rajasthan ke college ke college main shikshakon kii bhayanak kami he
 After the national anthem, what will they do when the students from the hostel arrive in the class and do not get teachers, i think whenever there is no teacher for any class, that class should also have a national anthem
 chaatr hi shikshak he tip ke naare se bhi chaatro kaa dhyaan hataaya ja saktaa he
 ndtv
 in kii site par puri uniwarsity series kaa link he aap dekh sakate hai
 The comments yah tasviir un shikshakon or chaatro kii he jo 500 kilometre chalakar mumbai main press conference karne aae hai
 So that the government sitting there can see them or the media there can convey their point to the government
 ye sabhi konkan ilaake ke chaatr or shikshak hai
 There are 103 colleges in Konkan which are affiliated to Mumbai University
 inaki maang he ki konkan ke liye alag se vishvavidhyalay hona chahie, 500 kimi kii duuri dekhte hue yah maang uchit bhi lagati he
 Students and teachers have to travel 500 km for small tasks
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra lagaataar mumbai uniwarsity kii pariksha main hui gadabadi ko lekar report kar rahe hai
 a private company was contracted to check the copy there
 sohit ko artiai kaaryakarta ne bataaya he ki us company ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiye gaye
 The company says that the rules were followed, Sohit asked the Education Minister for an answer, but refused to answer
 yahi nahin 2002 main uttarakhand sarkaar ne pant nagar uniwarsity krishi form kii 3339 acre zamin lekar vahaan audyogic kshetra bana daalaa
 Sources told Dinesh Mansera that neither the Agriculture Minister of the Manmohan Singh Government nor the Agriculture Minister of the Modi Government have stepped here
 uniwarsity series main ham gujarat yaa kai anya rajya cover nahin kar paae
 Due to resource constraints
 haal hi main rahul gandhi ne apane toun haul main ek professor ranjana avasthi ko gale laga liya
 There is a video of the Congress, not ours, first you hear what Sanskrit professor Ranjana Awasthi is saying
 koshish kii he ki hamaare saath alag se baat ho jaae magar safalataa nahin mili, dar ne logon kii aisi haalat kar di he
 Ranjana Awasthi's salary was 12000 after teaching Sanskrit for 22 years at NB Patel College, Ahmedabad
 kya aap duniya ke kisi bhi uniwarsity main koi ek naukari bataa sakate hai jahaan 22 saal kaam karne ke baad professor kii tankhwaah 12000 hoti he
 This example is not only from Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh to Delhi University
 sochie 22 saal kii naukari ke baad tankhwaah 12000
 Even after this exploitation, emotional issues continue in our politics
 jaise dilli uniwarsity main edock hota he, madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kehete hai usee tarah gujarat main asthai naukariyon ke liye samay samay par nai shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 After talking to the teachers there, two types of permutations were found
 phul time permanent or part time permanent
 i heard Part Time Permanent for the first time
 blendar mistek, ritern back jaisaa lagata he part time permanent
 Part time is written in the appointment letter, but while teaching part time in the same college, they start calling themselves part time permanent
 ye sab udhaaharan bataate hai ki agar sarkaar chaahe to logon se bina paise hi zindagi bhar kaam kara sakati he or log kaam bhi kar lenge
 We talked to Shah of Dinesh, Dinesh Bhai continued to teach as part time permanent teacher for 35 years
 ek hi college main 1980 se 2015 tak part time padhaate rahe
 i joined a salary of 2500 in 1980
 2015 main ritair hue to selary hui 12000
 Dinesh Bhai taught law in the same college
 35 saal baad dinesh bhai college se nikle to unke haath main kuch nahin tha
 Neither pension nor any social security
 gujarat main 1998 main part time or edock niyuktiyon par roak laga di
 300 part time teachers have survived
 ye sabhi bees-bees saal se padhaa rahe hai
 Six months ago, it has been decided that those who have phd will get 40,000 salary but neither will get the arrears nor any other facility
 gujarat main edock padhaa rahe ek shikshak se hamane phone par baat kii
 He said that in 2009, about 200 adhoc teachers were made permanent
 inamen se kai das se 15 saal se collejon main padhaa rahe the
 Due to permanent, salary increased but the previous dues were not received
 edock kii jagah ab sahaayak shikshak rakhe jane lage hai
 His salary is also fixed, will not increase every year
 sahaayak shikshak kii selary 40,000 kar di gai
 We do not have information on the number of students and teachers in colleges in Gujarat
 agar ye jaankaree hoti to kis college main kitne chaatr hai, kitne shikshak hai to tasviir or saaf hoti
 It is written by talking to three teachers, if something is wrong, the education minister can give a statement, we will definitely show it
 is bich shiksha ke kshetra main rajasthan sarkaar ne ek bada krantikari kadam uthaaya he
 The students may remain zero in studies but do not lag behind in patriotism, so that the Rajasthan government has issued a decree to sing the national anthem every day in 800 hostels
 subah 7 baje raashtragan hoga
 You saw in the University Series that there is a terrible shortage of teachers in the college of Rajasthan
 raashtragan ke baad hostel se chaatr jab class main pahunchenge or shikshak nahin milenge tab ve kya karenge, mere khyaal se jab bhi kisi class ke liye teacher na hon us class main bhi raashtragan hona chahie
 Students can be diverted by the slogan of the type that is the teacher
 ndtv
 You can see a link to the entire university series on the site of in
 tippaniyan This picture is of those teachers and students who have come to Mumbai for 500 km to hold a press conference
 taaki vahaan baithi sarkaar unhen dekh le yaa vahaan kaa media unki baat ko sarkaar tak pahunchaa sake
 All of them are students and teachers of the Konkan region
 konkan main 103 college hai jo mumbai uniwarsity se jude hai
 They demand that there should be a separate university for Konkan, given the distance of 500 km, this demand also seems reasonable
 chote-chote kaam ke liye chaatro or shikshakon ko 500 kimi kii yatra kerani padati he
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra is continuously reporting about the disturbances in the examination of Mumbai University
 vahaan copy jaanchane ke liye ek privet company ko theka diya gaya tha
 Sohit is told by an RTI activist that changes were made to the rules for that company
 company kahati he ki niyamon kaa paalan hua, sohit ne shiksha mantri se jawaab maanga to jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 We could not cover Gujarat or many other states in the University Series
 sansaadhan kii kami ke kaaran
 Recently Rahul Gandhi hugged a professor Ranjana Awasthi in his town hall
 congress kaa video he, hamaara nahin he, pehle aap suniye sanskrit kii professor ranjana avasthi kya kah rahi hai
 Have tried to talk separately with us but did not get success, fear has made people in such a condition
 ahmedabad ke enbi patel college main 22 saal tak sanskrit padhaane ke baad ranjana avasthi kii selary 12000 hui

 In a way, it is a force multiplier but language has also been exploited by selfish interests to create artificial walls in the country

 beete kuch dinon se atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki centre sarkaar shaayad anuchhed 35-e ko khatm kar sakati he
 It is discussed everywhere from social media
 mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla 35e main chhedchhad se bachane ko kah rahe hai
 In these ten points you can understand well what is ARTICLE 35A
 1
 ARTICLE 35 a was added to the Constitution in 1954, 7 years after the independence of the country
 ye anuchhed nehru cabinet kii sifarish par tatkaaleen raashtrapati dow
 Was added to the Constitution by an order of Rajendra Prasad
 2
 The only basis of ARTICLE 35A is the agreement that was signed between Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1952 and then Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Sheikh Abdullah
 ise dilli agreement bhi kehete hai
 3
 is agreement main bhartiya naagarikta ke maamle ko jammu-kashmir ke sandarbh main rajya kaa vishay mana gaya he
 Therefore, Kashmiris get some special rights in it
 isamen unke liye niyam bhi tay hai
 4
 ARTICLE 35 a main naukariyon, sampatti kii kharid-farokht, viraasat, scolership, sarkari madad or kalyankari yojanaon se judi suvidhaon ke sambandh main ye visheshadhikaar die gaye hai
 5
 ARTICLE 35 a raashtrapati ke aadesh se samvidhan main joda gaya:raashtrapati kaa ye aadesh samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 (1) (d) ke tahat jari kiya gaya tha
 This provision empowers the President to change and waive the need in the Constitution on the subject of the state in the case of Jammu and Kashmir
 6
 The special thing related to ARTICLE 35A is that while making it, it was added to the constitution by order of the President instead of the process of making laws from the parliamentary system
 jabaki samvidhan kaa anuchhed 368 (i) samvidhan main kisi bhi sanshodhan kaa adhikaar sirf sansad ko detaa he
 7
 ARTICLE 35 a se jammu-kashmir rajya kii sarkaar un logon ko sthai nivasee maanati he jo 14 may 1954 ke pehle jammu-kashmir main bas gaye the
 These residents get benefits in buying land, government jobs and government schemes in Jammu and Kashmir
 8
 ARTICLE 35 a also decides that a resident of another state cannot make a residence here as a permanent resident in Jammu and Kashmir
 ye hi nahin kisi duusare rajya ke nivasee kashmir main jameen bhi nahin kharid sakate hai
 9
 shaadi ke bare main bhi ARTICLE 35 a alag niyam nirdhaarit karata he
 According to the rules, if a woman from Jammu and Kashmir marries a person from any other state of India, then her rights are taken away, though in the case of men, these rules are different
 10
 Many years ago, a petition filed in the Supreme Court sought to abolish such discriminatory rules and implement similar laws across the country

 According to sources, on Monday, the lawyer of Nawaz Sharif family will file three separate appeals against the decision of the three convicted in Islamabad High Court
 saath hi teen anya apil pakistan kii ehtisaab (acountibility) adaalat ke faisle ko sthagit karne ke liye bhi hai court me somvaar ko hi daakhil hogi
 Now, when Nawaz Sharif's lawyers appeal in the court, it will have to be seen whether the Nawaz Sharif family gets relief before the general elections in Pakistan on July 25 or they will have to spend time in jail even further
