 Madhya Pradesh's Dewas court has acquitted Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, an accused in the Sangh campaigner Sunil Joshi murder case
 jisaki vajah is maamle kii kamjor jaanch hai
 The court has also reprimanded the MP police and NIA in this regard
 court ne donon jaanch agenciyon latad lagaate hue kaha ki saare saboot dekhne ke baad aisa lagata he ki itane mahatvapurn or sangeen maamle main empi police orenaiene pehle se hi soch rakhaa tha yaa phir kisi agyaat kaaran kii vajah se bahut hi kamjor jaanch kii he
 There was a contradiction in all the evidence collected by the two investigating agencies
 cese ko is tarah kamjor kiya gaya ki saare abhiyukton ke khilaaf koi bhi saboot nahin tha
 The evidence gathered was so weak that the investigation itself has come under suspicion
 jaankaron ke mutabik devas court ke is order kaa asar samjhauta express blast cese par bhi padegaa, kyonki sangh ke prachaarak sunil joshi hatyakand kii ek ahm gavaah kumari nira ne court ko bataaya ki usne kabhi yah bayaan nahin diya tha ki vah swami aseemanand, pragna thakur or sunil joshi ko jaanati he
 Kumari Neera also told the court that she never said that a secret meeting was held at Swami Aseemanand's ashram on 21 February 2007, where Swami Aseemanand, Sadhvi Pragya and Sunil Joshi met
 gauratlab he ki sibiai or uske baad NIA ne apni jaanch main samjhauta express blast ke baad in logon kii ek ahm baithak kaa zikr kiya tha
 Kumari Neera also denied before the court that Pragya had ever told her that she had relations with Sunil Joshi
 or ek baar sunil joshi ne pragna ke saath abhadra vyavhaar kiya tha
 And their relationship had soured
 nira ne court se kaha ki use pragna thakur ne kabhi yah nahin bataaya ki sunil joshi murder cese ke abhiyukt raamji consagara or sandip daange se pragna indore main ek flats main mili thi
 This information is also important because last month, a suspended Maharashtra police officer said that the murder of Ramji Kansagara and Sandeep Dange was done by Maharashtra ATS
 kumari nira ne yah bhi kaha kisadhvi pragnane use kabhi nahin bataaya ki jis raat sunil joshi kaa katl hua tha, usne ek doctor ko kaha tha ki devas ke aspataal main jaakar sunil joshi kii laash ko dekho
 Neera told the court that she never told the investigating agency that the night of Sadhvi Pragya Sunil Joshi's murder was very scared and nervous
 iske baad court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki court ko in tamaam binduon par vichaar karnaa tha ki kya yah ek gahari sajeesh thi
 From which pistol was Sunil Joshi killed by the accused? Was that pistol legal or illegal
 kya abhiyukton ne sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kii thi
 Significantly, the RSS pracharak Sunil Joshi was killed on 29 December 2007
 is maamle main sadhvi pragna samet aath logon ko aaropee banaaya gaya tha
 Pragya was associated with the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh
 uski giraftaar maalegaanv blast cese main kii gai thi
 He is sick now
 bhopal main hiraasat ke dauraan uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Pakistan has been given another deadline by FATF by February 2020 to stop the terror funding
 news agency eenai ke mutabik pakistan se kaha gaya he ki usko chaar maheene ke samay diya gaya he agar is baar vah naakaam rahaa to uske khilaaf karrwai kii hogi
 Let me tell you that Pakistan has been kept in gray list right now
 isamen un deshon ko rakhaa gaya he jinke kanoon mani londring or aatanki funding rokane main kamjor maane jate hai
 Now despite repeated warnings, the situation in Paris has not been implemented by Pakistan on the suggestions given by this institution (FATF), now in this case, a decision will be taken after four months on Pakistan
 FATF ne pakistan se saaf kaha he ki farvari 2020 tak vah is acshan plan ko puraa kare
 Otherwise, action will be taken after which member countries will be asked to take special care of their trade relations and transactions with (pakistan)
 aapako bataa den ki FATF ek antar-sarkari sanstha he jise 1989 main gathit kiya gaya tha
 Its job is to curb money laundering, terrorist funding and all such matters which can become a threat to the international financial system

 Congress leader and former home minister P
 P
 on Kashmir
 chidambaram ke bayaan par siyasat tej hote dekh congress party ne unhen is mudde par bayaanbaji se bachane ko kaha he
 According to sources, the Congress is unhappy about this statement of Chidambaram
 party ne chidambaram ko ab kashmir par bayaanbazi karne se manaa kiya he
 Despite all the efforts to come out after the meeting on Monday, Chidambaram did not talk to the media, nor did he answer any questions
 sutron ke anusaar, alaakaman chidambaram ke kashmir par die bayaan se naakhush he
 What did Chidambaram say? p Chidambaram during a program justified Jammu and Kashmir's demand for autonomy
 unhone saaf kiya ki kashmiriyon kii aazaadee kehane kaa matlab swaittata he
 Chidambaram said that the idea of giving regional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir should be considered
 swaittata dene ke baavjood ve bharat kaa hi hissaa rahenge
 Chidambaram's statement about Kashmir has also become a big issue in gujarat-himachal Pradesh elections
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne himachal main kaha he ki jo log kashmir kii aazaadee chaahate hai himachal ke log unhen kabhi vot nahin denge
 So at the same time BJP leader Subramanian Swamy tweeted that bjp's victory in Gujarat has been confirmed due to a statement by Chidambaram
 gujarati rashtravaadi hai
 BJP made the issue, Smriti Irani attacked the BJP, making it a big issue and termed Congress's politics of breaking the country
 soochna evam prasaaran mantri smriti irani ne twit kiya, ‘pi chidambaram kaa algaavvaadiyon or ‘aazaadee’ kaa samarthan karnaa hairaan karne vaala he haalanki main aashcharyachakit nahin hum kyonki unke netaa ‘bharat tere tukade honge’ naare kaa samarthan karte hai
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accused the Congress of promoting separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and said that Chidambaram's statement "harms" India's national interest which is a serious issue
 khud piem modi ne kaha- congress ke netaa un logon ke samarthan main kyon bol rahe hai jo kashmir kii aazaadee kii baat karte hai
 By doing so, they are insulting all our soldiers
 shanivaar ko congress ke ek netaa ne kashmir ko lekar jo bayaan diya usase saaf jaahir hota he ki party sargical strike or hamaari bahadur sena ko lekar kya vichaar rakhti he
 The Congress had avoided Chidambaram's statement, the Congress party had shunned Chidambaram's statement
 party pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha, ''jammu-kashmir or ladakh bhartiya sangh kaa abhinn ang hai nishchit rup se hameshaa rahenge
 Nobody's personal view is the idea of congress

 Now strictness has been started on the dress code under the Motor Vehicle Act
 jaipur ke sanjay cirkil thane ke ek inspector ne ek taxi chaalak kaa 1600 rupye kaa chaalaan isliye kaat diya
 Because he was driving a taxi in pajamas and slippers
 uske upar kii kameez ke batan khule hue the
 On 6 September, the cut or challan has been sent to the court
 inspector kaa kahana he ki puraane motor whical act main bhi taxi chaalkon ke liye blue shart or paint kaa dress code kaa praavdhaan he
 It is necessary for the safety of the people of the city besides the people visiting the city
 inspector ne kaha ki puraane motor whical act ke tahat hamane taxi chaalak ke proper dress nahin pahane par chaalaan kaata he
 We have sent the challan to the court, but there may be a decision in the court that the amount of challan may be increased even more
 gauratlab he ki rajasthan main nayaa motor whical act abhi lagu nahin hua he
 According to sources, the government has decided that once the new Motor Vehicle Act comes into force in the BJP ruled states, then the new Motor Vehicle Act will be implemented in Rajasthan with a provision of a lesser penalty amount
 maldive main raajnneetik gatirodh jari he
 President Abdullah Yameen has already implemented the emergency, not obeying the order of the Supreme Court in an attempt to preserve his power
 maldive sankat ko dekhte hue bharat or china ke alaava america bhi halaat par lagaataar najar banaae hue hai
 Now 2 journalists have been arrested there, both belonging to India, citing security law
 duusari ore, maldive main china kaa prabhutv lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he jis kaaran bharat kuch khaas madad nahin kar paa rahaa
 Despite being a small country, Maldives is very important for us
 in 10 vajahon se jaanate hai ki kyon bharat ko maldive ke halaat par lagaataar najar rakhni chahie or samasya kaa hal dhundhana chahie
 1
 maldive hind mahaasaagar main samrik rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn jagah par sthit he
 It is just 700 km from the Lakshadweep group of our country
 dur he
 The Maldives is adjacent to an important ship route that supplies energy to many countries such as China, Japan and India
 bharat kaa kareeb 97 fisadi antarrashtriya vyapaar hind mahaasaagar ke dwaara hi hota he
 Therefore, it can be understood how important it is for India to secure its routes
 2
 The Indian Ocean region is home to more than 40 countries and about 40 percent of the world's population
 china ne anti pyrets abhiyaan ke naam par 10 saal pehle hind mahaasaagar main adan kii khadi tak apane nausainik jahaaj bhejne shuru kiye
 Due to this, the importance of Maldives grew steadily and now it has become the center of international geopolitics

 hind mahaasaagar ilaake main suraksha-vyavastha kaayam rakhane main bharat kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 For this, it will have to cooperate with Maldives in the field of security and defense
 4
 China's growing economic cooperation with Maldives is a matter of concern for India
 maldive ke videshi karj main kareeb 70 fisadi hissaa china kaa ho gaya he
 The Maldives have had close ties with India for the first decades
 vahaan china kaa duutavas 2011 main hi khulaa he
 India opened its embassy there long before 1972
 isliye ab bharat ko china ke is dabadabe ko kam karne ke liye koi kadam uthaanaa hi hoga
 The current political crisis is an opportunity for this
 5
 India and Maldives have a decades-old religious, cultural, social and business relationship

 India's role in SAARC is like a vanguard nation

 Therefore, it is important for India to somehow make it into SAARC
 maldive saarc kaa ekmaatr aisa desh he jahaan piem modi kaa daura nahin hua he
 10
 maldive ek sunni musalmaan bahul desh he
 The current President Yameen has promoted religious bigotry in the country
 mana jaataa he ki maldive se badi sankhya main noujvaan syria jaakar iesas main bhartee hue hai
 Weak Maldives can become a haven for religious extremists and fundamentalists
 iske alaava vahaan taskari or nashili dawaaon kaa vyapaar bhi bad saktaa he
 These are all things that raise India's concern

 Or the upper shape of this device is funnel-like
 keep main barish kaa sidhaa pani girtaa he jo iske neeche lage ek bottlenuma paatr main jamaa hota he

 varshamapi kai tarah kaa hota he
 Rainfall is mostly measured in inches or centimeters
 adarsh varshamapi use kaha jaataa he jisamen ek khokhla belan ho, andar ek bottle rakhi ho or uske upar ek keep laga ho
 The rainwater is filled into the bottle by the funnel and later the water is measured by a gauge
 jab adhikari maap lene jate hai to unhen is kaam main 10 minute se zyada samay nahin lagata
 How to measure When the rain is to be measured, the water stored in the bottle is opened in a glass beaker by opening the outer cylinder, the number of millimeters is inscribed on this beaker
 ab to yantra main bhi millimetre ke ank hote hai
 The amount of water that comes into the beaker is the measure of rain
 iskaa matlab ye he ki jitna zyada mimi main maap aata he, barish utani hi adhik hui hoti he
 How often is it measured twice a day during monsoon

 After giving super-duper hits like 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', bringing Kabir Khan such a film is really amazing
 aisa lagata he ki diarector kabir khan se lekar actorsaf ali khan or katrina cafatak ko 'phantum' se kuch khaas lagaav nahin tha
 Then the film was very weak
 film saamne ai to khoda pahaad or nikali chuhia vaali baat
 The film's lead starcast is a mismatch and his dialogue delivery also does not evoke patriotism

 Kabir Khan has created such a weak story that it does not seem that he is a Kabir with 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'ek Tha Tiger'
 unke iraade nek hai lekin agjicution kharaab or kahani kamjor
 In the film, Kabir wanted to do something like emotions, action and suspense but he could not do anything and could create a hollow 'phantom'

 com / au0n8r5y8b Any advice for newcomer actors? In response, Rishi Kapoor told Rishi Kapoor, "today's newcomer actors are more interested in building their bodies and grooming themselves
 ve masals banane par zyada dhyaan dete hai, bhavatmak abhyaason par nahin, jo ek kalakaar ke liye mahatvapurn he
 When you are preparing for acting, not only your body but also your mind, because if you have acting skills, you will definitely become an actor and if you do not have it then you will be removed
 mujhe dekhie, kya meri body he? lekin main aaj bhi kaam kar rahaa hum, kyonki har film main main kirdaaron ko ubhaarne kii koshish karata hum
 "continuing her talk, Rishi Kapoor said," Well, i am old and probably the young ones will not be inspired by me, but look at Ayushmann (khurana), Rajkumar Rao, Ranveer Singh, Vicky (kaushal) and i am not naming him because he is my son, but Ranbir is also a talented actor, neither of them has 'dole-sholay' because living by dole will not make an artist

 It follows the belief in the process of public representation
 isliye agar iviem par vishwaas dagamagaa rahaa he to phir chunaav ayog kyon iviem kii tarafdaari kiye ja rahaa he
 What is the problem for the commission to conduct elections with ballot paper? Tiwari stressed that the decision should be reviewed if the parties involved in the process are not happy with it
 tiwari ne kaha 'yah bahut hi dukhad he ki chunaavon main hone vaali gadabadiyon par kadi nazar rakhane vaala chunaav ayog khud iviem ke vakil kaa role nibhaa rahaa he
 Democracy rests on public confidence
 yah janata ke pratinidhitiv kaa prakriya par jo vishwaas he, us par chalata he

 Agra city of Uttar Pradesh is called the capital of tourism and Taj Mahal is a priceless symbol of unmatched love
 duniyabar ke sailaani tajmahal kaa didaar karne ke liye agra aate hai
 But whenever there is an incident with foreign tourists or there is a conflicting statement about the Taj Mahal, it directly affects the tourism business of Agra
 paryaton aay kaa sabase bada strotagara shahar kii pahchaan puri duniya mentajamahalase hoti he
 People from every corner of the world come to India to see this marble building
 agra shahar ke nivaasiyon kii aay kaa sabase bada strot paryaton hi he
 According to one figure, employment of about four and a half lakh people in Agra is linked to tourism
 yahi vajah he ki jab bhi agra main aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya main kami aati he to ye log bhi usase prabhavit hote hai
 These losses are caused by the rhetoric
 In the last days, many politicians have directly come out with statements about the Taj Mahal
 jisaki vajah se desh or pradesh kii raajnneeti garma gai
 Politicians may or may not benefit from this, but their absurd statements have a big impact on the tourist business
 paryaton maamalon ke visheshgy rajeev tiwari kaa kahana he ki tajmahal ko prem kaa smarak kehete hai
 There have been controversies regarding this
 usase videshi paryatakon ke man main yah bhaavana aa gai he ki agra janaa surakshit nahin he
 Hotel bookings are canceled when a dispute is added to the Taj Mahal, news related to it is shown and published all over the world
 jis vajah se bharat kii taraf aane vaale paryatak ghabara jate hai
 The result is that they cancel the program to visit Agra
 isaki vajah se hotel indresti ko khaasaa nuksaan hota he
 Ameeruddin, general manager of the Royal Residency Hotel in Agra, says that when such incidents happen, it has a very bad effect on the hotel business
 booking cancil hone lagati hai
 Rajpal, the manager of a hotel, says such incidents are embarrassing for Hindustan
 iconomi par bhi fark padataa he
 The need to enact the Tourism Act Matham Singh, the well-known tour operator of the city of Agra, says that till today there is no law for tourism in our country
 paryaton indresti ko chalaane ke liye tourism act banaae jane kii zarurat he
 According to him, there should be an Act in the Constitution and there should be better laws to conduct this business
 rajasthan sarkaar ne is disha main kuch kadam uthaae hai
 Impact of misbehavior with tourist Wasim Ahmed, a well-known exporter of Agra, says that if misbehavior or violence takes place anywhere with the tourist, then a wrong message goes all over the world
 is baat kaa asar puure desh ke paryaton kaarobaar par to padataa hi he, saath hi agra shahar kii footware or handicraft intrustee par bhi iskaa prabhaav saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 If tourism stops, the economy is affected
 kaarobaari vijit gupta bataate hai ki hotel intrustee par aise maamalon ko sidhaa asar hota he
 Tourists do not even come and the image of the country is also bad
 har varg hota he prabhavitagara main kaam karne vaale guide hon yaa phir celsman yaa phir handicraft showrooms or hotel kaarobaari, har koi is baat se pareshaan rahata he ki tajmahal ko lekar na jane kab koi betuka bayaan aa jaae or paryatak agra aane kaa kaarykram radd na kar den
 The reason is not just a statement, but also the incidents of looting, beatings and violence that happen to the tourists on the day of the day also hurt this business
 zarurat is baat kii he ki sarkaar, police or paryaton se judi sansthaaen milakar is disha main kaam karen
 So that both the tourism industry and country image of Agra can be saved
 dilli hai court ne guuruuvaar ko dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar ke bich chal rahi jang par purna viraam lagaate hue apana faisla sunaaya
 Shocking the Delhi government, the court said that the Center will take the final decision on issues related to police, law and order and land in Delhi
 court faisle ko lekar 'aaj tak' ne dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang se khaas baatcheet kii
 Question: Sir, the judgment of Johai court has come, it is clear that it should be a matter of land, law and order or police
 kya kahin na kahin aap bos hai dilli ke?najeeb jang-dekhie shabd 'bos' to anuchit he
 There is no boss in India
 hamaare paas koi raja maharaj nahin he
 But what is our formula, from which our foundation is formed, is the Constitution
 agar vijay hui he to vah samvidhan kii vijay hui he
 It is wrong to say that Kejriwal has lost and Najeeb Jung has won
 hamaara koi astitv nahin he
 The court has made it clear that the constitution will be read in this way
 sawaal-kejarivalpahale bhi sawaal uthaa rahe the ki uparajyapal kaam nahin karne dete
 Work at the behest of the central government
 pehle se hi saaf he ki koun se adhikaar aapke hai or koun se unke hai?najeeb jang-main kahata hum ki ham sau prashn le to 99 ke uttar to mil hi jate hai
 i say that there are one two percent cases in which the constitution is violated
 vah unki samaj he
 Our effort is that we send the file back that the constitution says that we should see everything
 vah na karen to isamen ham kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 Question- It is said that you do not let them work
 18 bill pending hai
 Be it salary or Lokpal, don't you pass? Najeeb Jung - See, i do not have the right to pass the bill
 kejariwal sahab ko bill pehle centre sarkaar kii sweekruti lene ke liye bhejne chahie
 The bills which were not given to the Center, were again re-approved
 mantralay main bilon kaa pareekshan chal rahaa he
 When the work is done there, they will come back
 sawaal-aapako lagata he ki hai court ke nirnay ke baad kejariwal shant ho jaaenge or unhen pataa lag jayega ki sahi kya he?najeeb jang-iskaa jawaab unheen se lijie
 i can't give sawaal-aapke upar aarope lagate hai ki aap centre ke ishaaron par kaam karte hai
 a word was also used that you are working as an agent? Najib jung-i do not believe that this type of language should be used in public
 dilli ke mukhyamantri hai
 His language should be such that he would look like the Chief Minister of Delhi
 jahaan tak agent kii baat he, vah sahi he ki uparajyapal hote raashtrapati ke pratinidhi hote hai
 i meet the Central Government and not the Delhi Government
 sawaal-kejariwal ne kaha ki hamaare vidhayakon ko giraftaar kiya ja rahaa he
 They are being intentionally framed
 kejariwal ne yahaan tak aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri modi unako marava bhi sakate hai
 Why did such a situation arise and why did they feel like this? Najeeb Jung - See, it is useless that who will get killed, who will not get killed
 main phir kahuunga ki unki bhashaa acchhee nahin he or hindustan ke pradhanmantri ke liye munasib nahin he
 Modi ji has a huge personality
 hindustan ke prime ministar he
 i don't think they have any time for all these useless things
 jahaan tak bhashaa kii baat he, meri to hameshaa adwise yahi rahegi ki kaam dosti or bhai chaare se hota he
 Question- Sir, who are arresting legislators one after the other, they are being arrested deliberately to make such charges, one after the other? Najeeb Jung - Ask these questions to the Commissioner of Police
 main samajhataa hum ki jab bhi giraftaar hogi, to wo kisi vajah se hoti hogi
 Police cannot play with the law
 agar koi baat nahin hoti to jail kyon jate hai
 If there is any reason, the case should not go on
 supreme court or hai court main jajon kii niyuktiyon ke liye bees saal se chali aa rahi kolijium vyavastha ko khatm karne vaale rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) kanoon par sunwaayee karne ke liye supreme court main 5 jajon kii samvidhan peeth bana di gai he
 The bench will start hearing from April 15
 7 april ko supreme court kii dabl bench ne maamle ko samvidhan peeth bhejte hue kaha tha ki kanoon par roak lagane kii baat samvidhan peeth ke saamne rakhe
 a number of lawyers' bodies filed petitions in the Supreme Court and challenged it
 in yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki engeesi act ko manamaana or asanvaidhanik ghoshit kar nirast karne kii apil kii gai
 The petition said that this would increase the interference of the executive in the appointment of judges, which would affect the independence and impartiality of the judiciary
 sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne court main ise sahi tehraate hue kaha tha ki supreme court is maamle main abhi sunwaayee kar saktaa kyoking iske liye notification jari nahin hua he
 The petition said that the Judicial Appointments Commission Act and the 121st Constitutional Amendment Act should be repealed, as it increases executive interference in the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and High Court, which not only impedes the independence of the judiciary but also the core of the constitution
 It also affects the framework in which there is talk of an independent judiciary
 nyaayik niyukti ayog ke adhyaksh bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish honge
 Apart from him, there will be two senior judges of the Supreme Court, law ministers and two eminent personalities
 do vikhyath hastiyon kaa chayan teen sadasyeey samiti karegi
 In this committee, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice and the Leader of the Lok Sabha will be the leader of the opposition or the largest opposition party
 kanoon kii dhara 5(6) kahati he ki agar ayog ke do sadsy kisi kii niyukti ke liye sahamat nahin to ayog us vyakti kii niyukti kii sifarish nahin karegaa
 The petitioner says that this simply means that the view of the Chief Justice can be ignored, while the Constitution Bench of the nine-judge Supreme Court Advocate on Record case has said that the Chief Justice's opinion in the appointment of judges should not be ignored
 Whereas, according to the new law, a small group of commission (two members) can do so
 naye kanoon main do vikhyath vyaktiyon kii yogyata kya hogi yah tay nahin or na hi yah tay he ki ve kis kshetra se chune jaaenge jabaki in do sadasyon ke paas baaki ke chaar sadasyon kii raay palatney kaa adhikaar hoga
 Dhoni said on this occasion, i am very happy to be a part of it and will try my best to make it a success

 Tharoor said that there should be no dispute about separate flags of states
 desh ke 29 rajya apana alag jhanda rakh sakate hai or iske liye bilkul spasht niyam hai
 The former Minister of State for External Affairs said that the rationale for separate flags for the states is quite clear
 ekajhanda anti neshnal nahin ho saktaa, agar vah rajya kii samskruti or janata ke bandhutav ko darshata ho
 Tharoor said that its rules and regulations should be very clear that the state flag cannot be an alternative to the country's tricolor flag at any given time
 isaki aakaar chota hona chahie or jab donon jhande ek saath fahraae ja rahe ho, to rajya kaa jhanda tirange kii oonchai se neeche hi fahraayega
 He said that if the state flag is considered under the national flag, then there is no problem politically or constitutionally
 rajya ke liye yah ek creative cheez ho sakati he ki ve apane logon ko jhanda dizin karne ke liye aamantrit karen, jo rajya ke jaadui swaroop ko darshaae
 Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor said that America is a democratic country and its 50 states have their own separate flag

 He said that i do not think we should raise any opposition to the demand for separate flags of the states

 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman, while speaking to reporters, launched such an inquiry, criticizing the Congress' fascist and emergency-like attitude for taking political revenge from Modi
 unhone aarope lagaaya, yah raajnneetik badale kii bhaavana se kiya gaya faisla he
 Apparently the Fascist Congress has taken such a decision from the emergency mindset and the BJP will fight any such challenge and will fight on every platform
 ye nyaay ke liye nahin, balki raajnneetik rup se prerit kadam he
 Questioning the justification for the formation of the commission, he said that the enthusiasm with which the commission was formed shows what are the priorities of the government? party pravaktaa ne kaha ki jaanch rajya kaa vishay he, usamen kendra kii ore se jaanch bithaana uske adhik utsaah kaa sanket he
 This shows that the Congress party can adopt any method to suppress its political opponents

 loksabhaa main apni party ko netaa pratipaksh kaa darja die jane kii congress kii maang ko spikar sumitra mahajan ne aaj naamanzoor kar diya
 Sumitra said of her decision not to give the status of Leader of Opposition to the Congress, 'I have studied the rules and conventions
 ' spikar ke is nirnay ke bare main congress ko patr likh kar bataa diya gaya he
 Earlier, Congress President Sonia Gandhi had written a letter to Sumitra urging Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to give the status of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 yah nirnay karne se pehle spikar ne atorni general mukul rohtagi ke vichaar bhi liye jinhone kaha ki congress ke paas sadan main vah aavashyak sankhya nahin he jisase use netaa pratipaksh kaa darja diya ja sake
 The Congress is the second largest party in the Lok Sabha with 44 seats
 282 siton ke saath bhaajapa sabase badi party he
 The speaker has told the Congress, citing the rules, that he is not in a position to give the leader of the party the status of the opposition to the party leader in the House
 yah darja paane ke liye 543 sadasyeey loksabhaa main kisi dal ke paas is sankhya kaa kam se kam se 10 pratishat yani 55 seat hona aavashyak he
 In the context of this decision, Sumitra is also said to have cited the examples of 1980 and 1984, when no opposition party was given the status of Leader of Opposition due to lack of this number in the Lok Sabha
 khadge ne is nirnay par kaha ki vah is bare main kuch kehane se pehle congress alaakaman or party ke vidhi prakoshth kii raay lenge
 He said, 'it is one thing to be a recognized leader of opposition and working as a floor leader is another thing
 ' kendriya soochna ayog or kendriya satarkta ayog jaisi sanvidhik nikaayon kii niyuktiyon main kanoonee jaruraton ko dekhte hue netaa pratipaksh ke darje kii ahmiyat bad gai he

 Krrish 3 joined the 100 crore club in three days
 dhooma 3 ne teen din main 280
 25 crore was earned by Chennai Express, 226
 70 karod
 Well this year, Salman Khan's 'kick' also joined the 100 crore club in five days, but its business 126
 70 karod kaa tha, isliye yah chauthe number par he
 Similarly, Ajay Devgan's 'singham Returns' also joined the club of 100 crores in five days and its business was 100 at that time
 45 karod tha, kyunki ab 'baing baing' ne isse zyada kamai kar lee he to 'singhm riterns' 100 karod club ke chart par chathe number par khisak gai he
 The film is doing very well and it is expected that its earnings figure will break many records even further
 team india ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ne ek baar phir sabit kar diya ki unhen disijan rivyuu system (DRS) kaa 'master' kyon kaha jaataa he
 DRS is also called as Dhoni Review System
 shaayad hi koi mauka aayaa ho jab rivyuu ke maamle main dhoni se galati hui ho
 Normally, whenever Dhoni takes a review, the umpire has to change his decision and the same was seen in the Mahamukabal against Pakistan
 DRS phir sabit hua dhoni rivyuu systempakistan kii pari ke dauraan yujavendra chahal 8waan over karne aae
 The sixth ball of Chahal's over went to the pads of Pakistan opener imam-ul-haq
 bhartiya khilaadiyon ne kaaphi tej apil kii, lekin ampire ne out nahin diya
 After this, MS Dhoni, showing his understanding of DRS, asked Captain Rohit Sharma to take DRS
 jab bhartiya team ne diares liya to imam ul haq wicket ke saamne pakde gaye or saaf elbeadblyoo out the jiske baad ampire ko apana faisla badalanaa hi padaa

 He attributed Western anthropological modernism to imposing an 'equal for all' economic model where the West was made an ideal society for the rest of society
 unhone kaha ki ji20 or vishwa bank ne mana tha ki 'sabake liye ek jaisaa' aarthik model kargar na hoga; sanyukt raashtra bhi aise model ke khilaaf tha kyonki isane deshon kii saanskrithik prishthbhumi ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa tha

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has advocated the implementation of reservation in the private sector as well, after the decision to provide reservation in recruitment also under outsourcing in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne is bare main media se baatcheet main kaha, 'meri raay he ki privet sector main bhi aarakshan lagu kiya janaa chahie
 There should be a discussion on this at the national level
 'ullekhneey he ki bihar sarkaar ne contract par rakhe gaye karmchaariyon ke liye bhi aarakshan kaa niyam lagu kiya he
 That is, private companies that supply contract workers to government departments will also have to follow this rule of reservation
 nitish kumaar ne kaha, "bihar ke rigerveshan act ke anuroop hi ousorcing main aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Reservation will have to be followed in whatever restoration takes place through outsource
 kyonki in karmchaariyon ko bhi sarkari kosh kaa paisa jaataa he
 Therefore, the rule of the government will also apply to it
 or un companiyon ko isi anuroop iskaa paalan karnaa hoga, jo outsource ke jariye sarkaar ko karmchaaree uplabdh karaati hai
 "however, Nitish believes that government departments should not outsource much
 iske ulat kisi na kisi sarkari vibhaag kii ore se samay-samay par outsorcing kii demand hoti rahati he
 Nitish said, "in such a situation, if the rule of reservation in outsourcing is not applicable, then there can be a situation when the number of employees appointed through outsourcers in departments increases
 phir aarakshan kaa kya matlab rah jayega
 Those who do not know this rule, question it
 jisko buniyadi jaankaree nahin hogi vahi is par bahes chhedega
 "he said that private companies that do the work of the government will not have any effect on them
 aisa isliye karnaa padaa kyonki contract par niyukt karmchaaree apana association banaakar sthaayee karne kii maang bhi samay-samay par karte rahete hai
 In such a situation, if these rules are not implemented, then how can the government provisions be implemented
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki gujarat main vah patidaaron ke aarakshan ke mudde par aaj bhi apane stand par kaayam hai
 At the same time, BJP MP Hukumdev Narayan is also getting support on this demand of Nitish Kumar
 narayan se jab is bare main pratikriya maangi gai to unhone kaha, 'yah mudda uthaane ke liye main nitish kumaar ko badhai detaa hum
 Yes, this is the right demand, it must be churned at the national level
 'bataa den kinitish sarkaarne buudhvaar ko apane mantrimandal kii baithak main outsorcing ke tahat pradaan ore praapt kii jane vaali sevaaon main aarakshan lagu karne kii manjuuri di

 16veen loksabhaa ke liye sabhi pratyaashiyon kii kismat kaa faisla shuukravaar ko iviem mashiinon ke khulne ke saath ho jayega
 For this, proper sealing of EVM machines will be very important, so that the counting of votes can be done objectively
 in mashiinon main hare rang kii sil sabase ahm hogi, jisase pataa chalegaa ki mashin se chhedchhad hui he yaa nahin
 In fact, just as there is a green paper seal to close the ballot box, a green paper seal is the only important seal to close the electronic voting machine control unit
 agar yah hare rang kii paper seelein barkaraar hai to control unit main koi herapheri nahin ho sakati or mashin dwaara maton kii ricardig main kisi prakaar kaa koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 At the same time, no seal such as the sealing of the control box's sealing box or the candidate set section seal or the result block seal is found to be damaged, but if the green paper seal is intact then the polling station result can be known
 shuukravaar ko hone vaali matganana ko lekar nirdesh die gaye hai ki agar hare rang kii paper seelein vahi nahin pai jaati he to control unit ko alag rakhaa jayega or us unit main ricard kiye gaye maton ke parinaam nahin gine jaaenge
 District Election Officer Rajasekhar has said that given the importance of green paper seal for counting, candidates and their counting agents should be given a fair chance to be satisfied with this
 ve santusht ho sake ki paper sil vahi he jo matdaan prarambh hone se pehle matdaan centre par peethasin adhikari dwaara lagaai gai thi

 Candidates from Gujarat will also be announced in this, after which it will be clear from where the senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani will contest the elections
 sutron se mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabik, adwani gandhinagar se nahin, madhya pradesh ke bhopal se chunaav maidan main utarane ke icchhuk hai
 It is being told that the Madhya Pradesh BJP has given him such a proposal
 adwani ne party adhyaksh rajnath singh or rashtriya kaaryakarini ke raamalaal se kaha he ki un par bhopal se chunaav ladane kaa dabaav he, baaki party jo faisla karegi unhen manjuur hoga
 Gujarat BJP has sent a recommendation Actually, the Gujarat State Committee has sent the final recommendation on 26 names to the party's Central Election Committee
 isamen gandhinagar se adwani kaa naam or gujarat kii ek seat se modi ko ladane kaa prastaav he
 There are indications that Modi may contest from Vadodara or Ahmedabad East seat

 Opposition on ticket distribution in UP, even after the announcement of 54 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the screw is stuck in 26 seats
 gajiabad seat se general ve ke singh kii ummidavaari tay he lekin jile main party ke bheetar hi unka jam kar virodh ho rahaa he
 The talks with Jagdambika Pal, who are ready to change the Congress, have not finalized the Dumariaganj seat
 lekin, unki ummidavaari tay maani ja rahi he
 At the same time, the BJP may have resolved the issue of Ayodhya and Kashi, but there has been a screw up in Mathura

 After all, there is a need for a candidate who wins every seat, even if the candidate has to be brought from outside

 shivasena ke ekmaatr mantri anant geete cabinet main bane rahenge
 An English newspaper has reported that Heavy Industries Minister Anant Geete has not resigned and remains in the Modi government

 It has also been told that the Shiv Sena high command has asked him not to resign
 haalanki donon partiyon main siton ke bantwaare par asahmati he or donon alag-alag chunaav ladenge
 But Shiv Sena believes that this is a temporary dispute and a solution will be found
 shivasena ke ek sutara ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki yah lagata he ki kisi bhi party ko purna bahumat nahin milegaa, aise main chunaav parinaam aane ke baad donon ko saath aana padegaa, tab phir donon milakar yahaan sarkaar banaaenge
 Therefore, the party has asked Geete to continue in his post
 sena kii chintaa he ki agar geete se istipha dilava diya gaya to baad main modi unhen sarkaar main lenge yaa nahin
 They have been asked to do so only if the BJP asks them to resign

 log in dilli sarkaar ke tamaam vidhayak in dinon dilli ke uparajyapal ke ghar main mohalla clinics kii tamaam file paas karwaane ke liye dharne par baithe hai
 In such a situation, it is important to know that what are the arrangements for the public in the Mohalla clinics that are running? Are all types of tests going on in the open Mohalla clinic? Are all medicines available? Keeping all these questions in mind, the Delhi Aaj Tak team conducted a reality test to know the reality of some Mohalla clinic
 pesh he ye report
 
 
 First of all, the team till today went to the Pota Cabin Mohalla Clinic on the road of Osmanpur, then found that the patients are present in the aka-dukka mohalla clinic but the dog is asleep in the clinic
 poochne par doctor sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan test nahi hote hai magar aage vaale clinics main sabhi tarah ke test hote hai
 When we reached forward to know the reality of the Mohalla clinic in which the doctor had claimed to be tested, then there was no doctor or nurse and there was construction work in that Mohalla clinic
 iske baad dilli aaj tak kii team ne dilli sarkaar main mantri gopal raay kii vidhansabha babarpur main maujuud mohalla clinics kaa daura kiya jahaan doctor or nurse maujuud the
 The doctor claimed that all types of tests written on the board were being done here, but the patients present there flatly refused to do so
 ab yahaan marijon kii maane yaa doctor kii maane isi uljhan main ham logon ne babarpur vidhansabha main maujuud duusare mohalla clinics kaa daura kiya jahaan doctor sahab maujuud nahin mili nurse ne bataaya ki mohalla clinics main gandagi rahati he doctor sahab biimaar hai jisaki vajah se vah clinics se chale gaye hai
 Here too, there was a clear refusal to have any kind of test, and only two tests like BP Sugar were mentioned
 jaahir he dilli sarkaar ke tamaam vidhayak or zyada mohalla clinics kii maang ko lekar LG nivas main dharne par baithe hai magar jo mohalla clinics khul gaye hai kya vastav main vah us str par kaam kar rahe hai jaisaa ki sarkaar daawa karti he yah kahi naa kahi sawalia nishaan jarur khadey karata he
 In total, we visited 4 Mohalla clinics, out of which the doctor said to be tested in a clinic but the patients present there denied it, the doctor himself appeared from a Mohalla clinic, so it was reassuring that the patients The medicine was found, but in the name of giving medicine, the kind of publicity that the Kejriwal government does, it did not appear on the ground of reality beyond Twitter

 Indian Fans are embarking on their dream of a second successive title for Team India after a resounding win in league matches, but in the knock-out round, India first clash with Bangladesh in Melbourne on 19 March
 bangladesh ke khilaaf bharat kaa record chaahe kitna bhi acha ho, quarter final main isaki kai vajahen hai ki bangla tigers team india ko sakate main daal sakate hai
 Team India will need to be cautious against the Bangla Tigers for a number of reasons
 thik aath saal pehle 17 march 2007 ko bangladesh ke haathon team india kii haar kii tasviren aaj bhi tis paidaa karti hai
 a moderately regarded team from Bangladesh forced Team India, full of veterans, to lick the dust
 phir ye record myne nahin rakhata ki donon tiimon ke bich khele gaye 28 maichon main bharat ne 24 jite hai, bangladesh ke naam teen jeet hai or ek kaa nateeja nahin nikal paaya
 Mashrafe Mortaza took 4 wickets in that crucial match and half-century innings of Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan forced Team India to leave the World Cup
 phans or jaankaar ise ab bhi nahin dula paae hai
 That necklace is still fresh
 purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai ki 2007 world cap main hue us haar kii yaad ab bhi barkaraar he
 'little Master' says that you cannot take him lightly, but the cricketers like the then youngsters Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan have become more experienced after that victory
 kai jaankaar maanate hai ki bangladesh world cap main ab tak kii behtareen cricket khel rahi he
 The great thing is that the team's batting and bowling are clicking simultaneously
 darasal bangladesh team ke srilankai coach chandika hathurasinghe or unke sports manovaigyanik dow
 Phil Jones has worked very hard on the team
 inaki koshishon ne khilaadiyon main nayaa aatmavishvaas bhar diya he
 Bangladesh's 47-year-old coach Chandika Hathurasinghe (28 Tests, 35 odis) explains that in the dressing room, she is always a sports psychologist, Dr
 phil jones ke saath khilaadiyon ke role ko lekar saaf taur par baat karte hai
 We try to keep the players focused on their (original) game and do not miss a decision during the match
 ham khilaadiyon ko isaki kaaphi aazaadee dete hai
 He says that this has changed the atmosphere of the Bangladeshi dressing room and it has helped them a lot
 is world cap main bangladesh main ek nahin kai match-vinar ubharkar saamne aae hai
 Captain Mashrafe Mortaza, Mahmudullah, who scored a century in two consecutive matches, wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim, Kamal all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and bowler Rubel Hossain, who became the hero of victory against England, are in formidable form
 iske alaava purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai ki quarterfinal main sabhi tiimon kaa str behatar he
 Apart from this, there will be no scope for mistakes here
 galati hui or aap toornament se baahar ho sakate hai
 Gavaskar says that there will be this additional pressure on the team
 saath hi lig ke sabhi chah match jeetne vaali team india ko kai pahaluon par ab bhi dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 It has not been easy for Team India to chase the target so far in the tournament
 west indies or zimbabwe ke khilaaf team india ko lakshya kaa peechha karte hue kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi
 Openers need to be more consistent, while the real test of the team at number seven is yet to be done
 gavaskar ye bhi kehete hai ki jis tarah se zimbabwe ne bharat ke khilaaf 300 (48
 287 in 5 overs), if it happens against Bangladesh, then Team India will face problems, especially because Bangladeshi spinners and bowlers have better experience
 team india ko quarter final main khaas taur par chaukas rahane kii jarurat hogi, varanaa ab tak jo hasil hua he, us par pani na pad jaae
 Fans still remember that defeat in 2007 very uneasily
 us match main shunya kaa score karne vaale dhoni uske baad bhartiya cricket main kai baar shandaar itihaas likh chuke hai
 But a long time has passed and Team India has a great chance to sign on a new date by going ahead

 Varun Sharma will once again make the audience laugh as Chichor
 mumbai main naveen kumaar se baatcheet ke dauraan 'chhichhore' ke alaava anya muddon par bebaaki se apni baat rakhi
 Here are the highlights - Mumbai
 duniya ko hansaane vaale varuna sharma ko dar bhi lagata he
 Their fear is slightly different
 ve kehete hai, 'main apane chaahane waalon kii us ummid ko tuutane nahin dena chahta jo unhone mujhase laga rakhi he yani wo hansanaa chaahate hai
 i also try to have a smile on his face whenever he sees me
 ' phukare kaa chuuchaa yani varuna sharma arjuna patiala or khandaani shafakhana ke baad chhichhore film main apane rochak kirdaar ke saath ek baar phir darshakon ko hansaane vaale hai
 
 ve kehete hai, 'mere kairactor kaa naam hi sexa he or yah sexa aisi harakatein karata he jisase log hans-hanskar lotpot ho jaaenge
 'dangal Fame director Nitesh Tiwari has directed this film
 isamen sushant singh rajput or shraddha kapur bhi hai
 Shraddha has just released Saaho and people are liking her
 iskaa phayda chhichhore ko mil saktaa he
 Varun has also learned a different mode of acting from Nitesh in Chichhore
 varuna kaa maananaa he ki abhinay main kamedi joner sabase kathin he
 People think it is easiest to laugh
 lekin yah sabase mushkil kaam hota he
 Today is such a time that everyone is upset and everyone also bothers others
 ham apni jaddojahad main or jindagi kii bhaag-daud main bhi lage rahete hai
 This has reduced patience
 usamen kisi ko aap thode samay ke liye hansaa sakate hai to bahut acha he
 But one cannot do the job of making a guy laugh in a comedy film alone
 team kaa sahi hona bahut jaruri he
 No matter how good i make the scene, if the reaction does not come from the front, then that scene will make you bored
 ection ke saath timming match karnaa jaruri he
 Varun, who is riding his success with Fukrey, does not get bored with being typecast for comedy
 bataur varuna, 'main tab tak bor nahin ho saktaa jab tak audiens ko mujhase hansi kaa dose mil rahaa he
 i also feel that i am getting cast on a regular basis in Comedy Zone
 mere liye jaruri he regular basis par cast hona, tipcast hona baad main hoga
 i also enjoy this thing
 hansaana acha lagata he
 It's nice to see people smiling
 ' vaise, varuna aisi script ke bhi intjaar main rahete hai jo alag joner kii ho
 He says, 'I am working in a film with a different shade called Rooh Afza
 yah ek horer kamedi he
 There is comedy in this, different joner is also with the horror
 daraate-daraate hansaaenge or hansaate-hansaate daraayenge
 Varun says that he never attempted comedy before Fukrey
 kyonki isse pehle ve chandigarh main ashwatthama or andhayug jaise gambhir naatak karte the
 After performing theater for five years, Fukrey attempted comedy for the first time at the audition
 jab film dekhi to unhen laga ki ve logon ko hansaa sakate hai
 He says, 'there was such a change in life that after Fukrey, Jonar became a comedy
 lekin main theatre ko miss karata hum
 i will definitely play one if i get a chance
 ''kamedi ke liye kisi kii nakal kii jarurat nahin he
 Varun further adds, 'it is now a situational comedy
 main charlie chaplin ko bahut pasand karata hum
 i have seen all his movies
 lekin mere abhinay main unki chhap nahin milegi
 'as Varun,' whenever i watch any series, i do not see comedy in it
 main thriller, dark aisi chijen dekhtaa hum
 Three percent, Black Mirror is my favorite show
 standap kamedi nahin dekhtaa hum
 i don't know what makes me laugh main bahut sochataa hum ki yahaan tak aane main jo samay laga he uski vailu he
 'varun has suffered from stardom that now he has to eat in a streetfood car
 congress ne bade jor shor se upi main apana chunavi campagne shuru kiya
 Hired Prashant Kishore, who won Modi in 2014 and Nitish in 2015
 prashanth kishor ne ranneeti ke saath upi main aagaaj kiya
 Congress gave the slogan of UP Behaal for 27 years
 naaraa shuruyaat main hit rahaa or kisaan yatra ke dauraan khaat sabha se bheed batorne kii koshish hui, par is chunaav ne upi main congress ke khaat sabha kii hawa nikaal di
 How Confused After a Good Start Congress From 6 September 2016, Congress started preparations in UP
 prashanth kishor ne 'kisaan yatra' kaa road map khinchaa, devaria se dilli tak yatra nikaali gai
 The Congress claimed that 25 thousand of Purvanchal directly connected with Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki, is dauraan rahul kisaanon ke saath khaat par baithkar charchaa karne utre to sabha ke baad log khaat lekar hi bhaagate najar aae
 Those photos were a big hit on social media
 political campagne ke lihaaj se acchhee shuruyaat kahi ja sakati he
 But the hope of an alliance with the SP and then the Congress was badly confused by the alliance
 kanfusion main fail hui congress kii nai timupi ke liye congress ne nai ranneeti banaai, team main badlaav kiye
 Sheila Dixit, who was defeated in Delhi as a Brahmin face, was made the face of CM at the behest of Prashant Kishore
 pradesh congress ke adhyaksh ke taur par kaman raaj babbar ko di gai
 Both started their work as well but due to co-ordination with Prashant Kishore and the confusion of not having an alliance, they could not bring success to the team
 gathbandhan hote hi bai difolt shila dikshit siem ke chehre se hat gayi, raaj babbar bhi khulkar saamne nahin aa saken
 If sources are to be believed, Prashant Kishore could not keep Congress leaders in the party
 nae president raaj babbar se upi main unki thik-thaak nahin bani
 Babbar always considered Prashant as an assistant
 rahul kii sabha main jab khaat lekar bhaage the lograhul gandhi ne sitambar ke maheene main devaria main pehali khaat sabha karne pahunche the
 After the meeting there, people escaped only by taking a cot
 vahaan rudrapur ke liye dilli se 2 hajaar khaaten mangvayi gai thim
 After finishing the speech, there was chaos for robbing the cot as soon as Rahul left
 koi sir par khaat lekar bhaaga to koi uske paae todakar le gaya
 People were taking cots on bikes and autorickshaws

 The Raman-led bench ruled that the Speaker does not have the power to disqualify mlas until the term of the House ends
 supreme court ne haalanki istife kii vaidhata par tippanee karne se parhez kiya he
 The apex court emphasized constitutional ethics, stating that the Speaker can only examine the resignation whether voluntarily given or otherwise for reasons
 supreme court ne kaha ki isamen koi andeh nahin he ki ayogyata tab hoti he jab dalbadal hota he
 The defections took place before the resignation, therefore, the doctrine of disqualification does not abate and the Supreme Court upheld the Speaker's decision to disqualify the mlas

 uttar pradesh main ho rahe nikaay chunaav ke tisare or aakhri charan main aakhirkaar pardaanasheen mahilaon kii pahchaan sunishchit hone lagi he
 In many booths in Mughalsarai, Chandauli, Baghpat and Saharanpur, women who came to vote in the burqa were identified by matching their voter eye cards and faces and only then they were allowed to vote
 sabase pehle isaki maang uttar pradesh bijepi ne kii thi or baqayada rajya chunaav ayog ko ek gyaapan dekar yah maang kiya tha ki parde, burke yaa ghunghat main ai mahilaon ke chehron kaa milan unke voter idi card se kiya jaae or iske liye mahila suraksha kii khaas vyavastha kii jaae
 Although the Election Commission had not issued any official order in this regard, but administration has implemented it in many districts
 mughalsarai, chandauli, bagpat or saharanpur main aaj kai boothon par yah dekhne ko mila ki mahila surakshakarmi burke main ai mahilaon kii pahchaan unke ai card se kar rahi hai or saath-saath burka hataakar chehre se ai card kaa milan bhi kar rahi hai
 In the last phase of the municipal elections, voting is going on in 26 districts for Municipal Corporation, Municipality and Nagar Panchayats
 matdaan ko sakushal sampann karaane ke liye ek taraf jahaan suraksha ke kade intjaam kiye gaye hai vahi farji vot ko rokane ke liye bhi chunaav ayog dwaara intjaam kiye gaye hai
 During the voting in Mughalsarai / Chandaulimuglasarai, the face of Muslim women was removed by removing the burqa
 iske liye ek mahila consteble ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 On the other hand, Muslim women voters expressed their displeasure over this system
 mughalsarai main ek booth par maujuud mahila surakshakarmi shail kumari ne kaha, "upar se nirdesh he ki jo bhi mahilaayein burka main aaen unka cheharaa pahchaan patr se milan karaayaa jaae
 "but Muslim women who came to vote wearing a burqa were offended by this
 unka kahana tha ki vah pehle se burke main vot karti rahi hai or is tarah kii pahchaan kii kavayad kabhi nahin hui
 Rumi Parveen (voter Mughalsarai) said, "we have already voted but this is the first time that the mask is being seen with the face removed
" ye ham logon ko acha nahin lag rahaa he
 "some of the same opinions were also from Nazia who came to vote at this booth
 najia kaa kahana tha ki pahchaan sunishchit ho thik he lekin yah baahar kii bajaae andar ekant main hona chahie
 Nazia (voter) said, "it should not have been so out
 thodaa andar hona chahie tha
 "the third voter, Salma, is telling this against Islam itself
 unka kahana he ki hamaari pahchaan munh dhak kar bhi ho sakati he or hamaara pahchaan patr hi pahchaan ke liye kaaphi he
 Salma (voter) said, "this is not right for Islam
 ye acha nahin he
 If fake votes are being made to stop, then we have an identity card
 munh dhak ke bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 "A similar view was seen in saharanpur-saharanpur when a large number of women dressed in burqas lined up to ensure their identity by removing the burqa before voting
 saharanpur main burkanashin auraten bhi badi sankhya main vot daalane pahunchin
 To identify him inside the polling booth, his identity was ensured by removing the burqa and cloth from his mouth
 iske baad hi apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kar sakin
 The Veer Smarak Inter College in Baghpat Baghpat has gathered crowds of Muslim voters
 yahaan jo bhi muslim mahilaayein burke main aa rahi hai
 They are being checked and only then they are being allowed to go to the polling booth
 poling booth par tainaat mahila pulicekarmi puri mustaidi se ye dekhne kii kii koshish kar rahi hai ki kahin koi burkanashin aisi to nahin he ki jo dobaaraa vot daalane ja rahi ho
 Along with this, they are also being identified by their identity cards
 haalanki kuch mahila matadaata iskaa virodh bhi kar rahi hai
 However, no Burkhanshi polling station is being filed without checking
 chaahe mughalsarai ho, saharanpur ho yaa phir bagpat
 
 
 Burkanshi women opposed this and in many places they also gave other ways to ensure identity but the administration was able to cast their votes only after checking them in front of women police and women constables
 aapako bataa den ki yah maang bijepi kii taraf se kaaphi pehle se rahi he aurabijepi se jude muslim netabhi iske samarthan main rahe hai
 Yogi government minister Mohsin Raza has already said that when the face can be shown for Aadhaar and passport then why not during voting
 baharhaal is par vivaad hona tay he kyonki muslim moulana dharmaguru iskaa virodh karte dikh rahe hai
