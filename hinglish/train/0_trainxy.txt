 ) koi aapse ye kahe ki wo kagaz ke tukdon ko dollar main badal saktaa he, to aapkaa jawaab kya hoga? blike dollar ke dhandhebaazon ke paas wo jaadui takareeb maujuud he, jo dekhte hi dekhte ankhon ke saamne kaagaj ke tukdon ko chamchamaate america dollar main tabdeel kar detii he
 But whoever believes in this trick does not open his luck, but he becomes a pauper
 aakhir kyon?kya koi bagaiyr kisi jaan-pahchaan yaa matlab ke baithe-bithaae kisi ko karodon rupye kaa vaaris bana saktaa he? aap kahenge ki aisa kisse kahaniyon main hi mumkin he
 Not in reality lekin ek shaks ko videsh se aae ek i-mail main kareeb 21 karod rupye die jane kii baat kya kahi gai, usne is par turant yakeen kar liya
 But whatever happened after that, now it is difficult for this person to believe him
 naam: venkatarmanapahchan: andhra pradesh kaa ek garib kisaanjam: dhokhe main aakar 6 lakh ganvaaeandhra pradesh ke is garib kisaan venkataramana ne aise hi ek peshkash par yakeen karke qareeb chah lakh rupye ganvaa die
 But even after this, when his dream of getting crores of rupees was not fulfilled, he came to Delhi and complained directly to the police
 nateeja ye hua ki jis shaks ne use karodon rupye dene kaa jhansa de kar usase 6 lakh rupye jhatak liye the, wo akhirkaar police ke hathe chadh gaya
 But if Venkataraman had been a little too late to react, these foreign nationals would have been nine to eleven soon after robbing millions of rupees
 ab aaie aapako blike dollar ke naam par venkataraman ke saath hui thagi kii ye puri kahani samajhane ke liye takreeban maheene bhar peeche liye chalate hai
 In this mess, trapped by email, Venkat was checking his e-mails daily
 isi dauraan uski nigaah ek aise i-mail par padi, jise dekh kar uske hosh hi ud gaye
 This mail was written to him by a woman from America
 mahila kaa kahana tha ki uske pati kii maut ho chuki he or wo khud bhi cancer ke last stage se guzar rahi he
 But before he died, he deposited a total of 8
 5 million dollar kii rakam se hindustan main garib bacchon ke liye skool or aspataal kholana chaahati he
 If she takes up this task in India, she will hand over 40% of her accumulated capital to him
 ye mail padhate hi venkat khwaabon kii duniya main kho gaya
 Because 8
 5 million dollar matlab he takreeban 52 karod 70 lakh rupye or iske 40 fisadi matlab 21 karod 8 lakh rupye
 Venkat felt that his world would change
 blike dollar ke tilism main ulajh kar ye shaks ab barbaad hone ke kagaar par tha
 He had deposited 6 lakh rupees for the greed of 21 crores
 lekin isse pehle ki blike dollar ki tijori khulti, use hosh aa gaya
 Seeing the dream of getting millions of dollars, Venkat's mind was disturbed
 use yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki kismat yun tut kar us par meharbaan hui he
 6 lakhs sent as fees, in the subsequent e-mail, as soon as the woman asked for the money in the form of processing fees and legal fees for transferring her dollars, then she did not find anything strange
 or is tarah usne us mahila ke dilli ke acount main alag-alag fees ke naam par takreeban 6 lakh rupye transfar kar die
 But even after this, when the woman continued to ask for money from him, she got some doubt and went straight to Delhi
 lekin yahaan ek hotel main use africa mul kaa ek aisa shaks mila, jisane khud ko us mahila kaa agent bataaya
 He had reached Venkat with a vault of black dollars to keep him in the loop
 lekin isse pehle ki tijori kaa puraa tilism khulata, kaale kaagaj dollar main badalte, venkat kaa shaq gaharaa gaya or wo sidhe police ke paas ja pahunchaa
 Now the police raided the hotel and arrested the foreigner for about 5 crores of fake or black dollars
 or isi ke saath thagi kii puri kahani saamne aa gai
 It was the foreigner who was sending fake e-mails and robbing Venkat sitting in Delhi

 While the BSP supremo Mayawati has announced to contest alone on 11 seats in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav has said that i am not aware of it
 jis samay mayawati ne apane party netaaon ke bich yah faisla kar rahi thim usee samay akhilesh yadav azamgarh main kaaryakartaaon kii raily ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He then interacted with the media
 jab unase bispi supremeo mayawati ke is faisle ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'mujhe isaki jaankaree nahin he, main to azamgarh main hum'
 Significantly, on Monday, Mayawati has said in a meeting of her party leaders that sp's Yadav votes have not been transferred to BSP, even Akhilesh Yadav has not been able to win his wife Dimple Yadav
 isliye party ne faisla kiya he ki rajya main 11 vidhansabha siton par hone vaale upachunaav main vah akele ladegi
 In a way, this statement of the BSP supremo is like an informal announcement to break the grand alliance
 bispi netaa sukhdev rajbhar ne bataaya ki bispi chif ne kaha, espi-bispi gathbandhan ke nattejey santoshjanak nahin rahe hai
 Both have suffered defeat
 ab isko kaise sahi kiya jaae
 i respect Akhilesh Yadav
 unako bhi is baat par vichaar karnaa chahie ki unke samudaay ke log samarthan karte he yaa nahin
 On the other hand, Samajwadi Party MLA Hariom Yadav has said that Mayawati has benefited from the alliance and the Samajwadi Party has suffered heavily
 agar gathbandhan nahin hua hota to mayawati ko ek bhi seat nahin milti or sapa ko kam se kam 25 siten milteen
 The Yadav community voted for him but his vote went to the BJP
 kul milakar aisa mana ja saktaa he ki mayawati ab sapa ke saath gathbandhan ke mood main nahi hai
 The BSP does not contest the by-elections in general
 mayawati ne party netaaon se 11 vidhansabha siton ke up chunaavon ke liye ummidavaaron kii suchi banane ke liye kaha
 This by-election will be due to these mlas being elected to the Lok Sabha
 bhaajapa ke nau vidhayakon ne loksabhaa chunaav jeeta he, jabaki basapa va sapa ke ek-ek vidhayak loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye hai
 Meanwhile State BSP President R
K
 es
 Kushwaha told reporters that evms are mainly responsible for the bsp's poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 basapa ne uttar pradesh main 10 loksabhaa siten jiti hai
 The party contested 38 seats
 duusari taraf samaajawaadee party ne 37 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or party sirf paanch siten jeet saki
 The Rashtriya Lok Dal contested three seats and could not win a single seat
 dilachasp he ki mayawati va sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne ab tak bhavishya ke gathbandhan par ek bhi shabd nahin kaha he

 a Pakistani court today dismissed a petition filed against the detention under a public safety law of 2008 Mumbai terror attacks conspirator Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and will remain in jail for the next month
 lahore hoicourt ke nyaayadhish mahmud makabool bajva ne punjab sarkaar dwaara 14 march ko lok vyavastha banaae rakhane se jude kanoon ke tahat 55 saal ke lakhvi kii hiraasat ke aadesh ke khilaaf daayar uski yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 Earlier this morning, the judge reserved the verdict after hearing the arguments of Lakhvi's lawyer Raja Rizwan Abbasi and Law Officer Khawar Ikram Bhatti
 adaalat ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'adaalat ne lakhvi kii yachika khaarij karne kii ghoshnaa karte hue ek sankshipt aadesh jari kiya
 Lakhvi challenged his detention in the Lahore High Court on Thursday and requested the court to dismiss the Punjab Home Department order which is in violation of the order of the Islamabad High Court
 abbasi ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne mere muvakkil ko mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ke maamle main jamaanat milane ke baad se use chaar baar hiraasat main liya
 According to Abbasi, the government has detained Lakhvi under pressure from India and the US
 vidhi adhikari ne daleel di ki lakhvi mumbai aatankwaadi hamale main mukhya aaropee he or jamaanat par uski rihaai se praant main kanoon vyavastha kii gambhir samasya paidaa ho sakati he
 Before Lakhvi would be released from Adiala Jail Rawalpindi on the order of the Islamabad High Court, the Punjab government had on 14 March ordered him to remain in custody for 30 days under Public Order Maintenance Act (MPO)
 islamabad hoicourt ke nyaayadhish nurul haq kuraishi ne 13 march ko lakhvi ko hiraasat main lene sambandhi sangheey sarkaar ke aadesh ko nilambit kar diya tha or uski turant rihaai ke aadesh die the
 India had reacted strongly to the Islamabad High Court's order, saying that the Pakistani evidence did not properly present the concrete evidence against Lakhvi before the court
 18 disambar 2014 ko nichali adaalat (aatankwaad rodhi adaalat-1, islamabad) ne lakhvi ko jamaanat de di thi, lekin agle hi din use empio ke tahat hiraasat main le liya gaya tha
 However, the Islamabad High Court had suspended Lakhvi's custody citing 'weak legal grounds'
 adiyaala jail se reeha kiye jane se thik pehle lakhvi ko 2009 main ek afgaan naagarik kaa apharan karne ke aaropon main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He also got bail in the kidnapping case
 baad main sarkaar ne supreme court main islamabad hoicourt ke aadesh ko chunauti di
 The Supreme Court suspended his order
 lakhvi ne apni hiraasat ko ek baar phir chunauti di or use 13 march ko adaalat se raahat mil gai
 The Islamabad High Court had constituted a three-member review board headed by Justice Shaukat Siddiqui to hear Lakhvi's plea against his custody

 Film Review- Dangal: If the casting of some characters of the film is not less than the ends, and the film would have been more interesting if the casting was improved
 aditya or shraddha ke bich kii camestry kaaphi feeki si dikhaai padati he jisase rilate kar paanaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 The film is not gripping, while Nasiruddin Shah and Leela Samson's relationship is emotional, the story of Aditya and Shraddha seems neither romantic nor emotional
 film kyon dekhen-aditya roy kapur, shraddha kapur yaa nasiruddin shah ke diwane hai to ek baar jarur dekh sakate hai
 The film can also be seen for the excellent music of AR Rahman

 vah ek alakh jagaakar gai thi
 She herself slept forever, but woke up the country
 aaj uski maa insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he
 So that the release of that minor rapist can be stopped
 taaki hajaaron bacchiyon ke aise hajaaron apradhi kuch to khauf khaaen
 When the same mother takes to the streets one night before the release of her minor, the entire administration is shaken
 jo dilli mahila ayog us repist ke punarvaas kii yojanaayen bana rahaa tha, usee kii adhyaksh swati maliwal aadhi raat ko supreme court jaj ke ghar bhaagti hai
 Appeals that this rapist should not be released
 supreme court register bhi sunwaayee ke liye maamla manjuur kar lete hai or somvaar kii taarikh bhi de dete hai
 But all this happens when the parents start staging justice for justice at night
 is pradarshan ko majboot hote dekh police unhen jabaran hataa detii he
 Now the same mother is once again appealing for the movement like three years ago, so that the government can wake up from sleep and this rapist can get her punishment
 us maa ke kai sawaal hai, aakrosh he, ahsaneey pidaa he or ek apil he
 
 
 'what did the government do in three years? What lesson? Everyone understood our pain
 lekin is kanoon vyavastha or prashasan ne nahin samajha
 We waited for three years
 main piem ke paas bhi gai
 He assured me a year ago
 par aaj jab wo reeha ho rahaa he to sab logon ne apane haath khadey kar liye
 Everyone is praising the law
 kya ek criminal kanoon todakar aparaadh kar saktaa he?puri kaaynaat ek apradhi ko bachaane ke liye ek ho gai
 When my daughter was dying, when thousands of girls are dying today, does this administration have no responsibility? aapako to ghoomane se hi fursat nahin mili
 Today i am standing on the road screaming and our PM is learning yoga
 kisi ko kuch karnaa hi nahin he
 Today i failed
 teen saal kii sari koshishen naakaam ho gayi
 a criminal won
 ek victim kii maa haar gai
 But no! This fight is still on
 mujhe meri beti kii takalif ne sab sikhaa diya
 My baby girl was alive for 10 days, but she did not get even a sip of water
 jab wo jane lagi to maine usase vaada kiya tha- insaaf kaa
 We were forced to come down the road at night for justice
 lekin police ne hamen vahaan se gaadi main bharke hataa diya
 Jyoti's father's shirt was torn
 jab ham raat main sadak par utre to supreme court jaaya gaya
 Couldn't think of it earlier? But we are not helpless
 asahaay he hamaari kanoon vyavastha
 We are angry at the hollow promises that we will protect women and when it comes time to do so, we are trying to save the culprit
 agar kisi netaa, mantri kii beti se balaatkaar ho jayega to kanoon bhi badal jayega
 But they do not care about the poor
 hamaari aankh khulti he or ham puure-puure din baahar ghoomte hai ki kahin se insaaf mil jaae
 Now, what will happen if they change their rule? God does not come and make laws
 insaan ne hi banaaya hoga kanoon
 Governments change over time, laws change
 ab to apni ankhen kholo
 This is not just a fight for justice for one daughter, it is a fight for thousands of girls
 sarkaar samay rahete sajaa nahin detii he to bahut bada andolan hoga
 Today we will start this movement from jantar-mantar
 ham aap sabhi se apil karte hai ki is ladaai main hamaara saath den

 Ishq's stories' review brings with it many responsibilities
 aisa isliye ki neelesh misra kii pahchaan ek gambhir patrkaar, lekhak, geetkaar or kissago kii he
 In such a situation, there is this fear in your mind that you do not get influenced by their established image and do not write anything wrong due to any other prejudice
 do sau bees pannon kii is kitaab main kul jamaa 14 kahaniyaan hai
 These stories have been written by renowned writers Azam Qadri, Akbar Qadri, Kanchan Pant, Durgesh Singh, Ayush Tiwari and Nilesh himself of Nilesh's radio team
 kitaab ke naam ke anuroop sabhi kahaniyaan prem kahaniyaan hai, jo unke radio sho 'yaadon kaa idiyat box' main sunai gai thim
 The first story of the book is 'phir Milenge'
 yah kahani neelesh ne likhi he or jab aap us kahani ke shabdon main chadhate-utarate hai to ek halkaa sa nasha chadhataa he, pyaar kii khumaari kaa
 
 yaadon kaa, beeti jindagi kaa or rumaniyat ke un palon jo takreeban ham sabhi ke ateet kaa hissaa rah chuke hai
 This is the story of a divorced couple reuniting and reuniting
 'bade shahar main rahane par pet ke alaava, bhaawanaaon par bhi charbi chadh jaati he
 Where does a relationship break life? ' kahani main neelesh kuch aisi hi behtareen panktiyon kii madad se jindagi kii sachchaaiyaan bhi kah jate hai
 At the end of the story, the two estranged husband and wife are reunited
 agali kahani ‘tu kuja, man kuja’ ajam kadri kii he
 Azam has made best use of Urdu language in the story
 kahani ke dialogs main bhavanaaen bahut achche se samaayi hui hai
 In one place, the protagonist of the story tells the heroine that the real prison is not where humans are imprisoned, rather it is where our soul is imprisoned
 is kahani main bhi saalon baad bichade nayak-nayika aakhir main mil jate hai
 The end of the entire nine stories one after the other is almost a bit
 jo pridictbal ban jaataa he or yahi is kitaab kii sabase badi khami he
 The tenth story of the book has a different ending
 haalanki kitaab kii bhoomika main hi ye bataa diya gaya tha ki ye kahani sangrah neelesh ke radio kaarykram 'yaadon kaa idiyat box' main shaamil kiye gaye kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Would have been nice if these stories were part of the same program because there is a difference between a book and a radio
 agar aap ke man-mastishk ko ek hi swaad kaa khaanaa diya jaae to aap nihsandeh dimagi diabetes ke shikaar ho jaaenge
 Unfortunately, this book leaves something similar in our hearts and minds
 mere khyaal se in kahaniyon ko pathakon ke saamne pesh karne se pehle is par or kaam kiye jane kii zarurat thi
 When you tell a story on the radio, it has an effect for a few hours
 lekin likhe shabdon kaa asar lambey vakt tak rahata he
 Writers or publishers have failed to understand this difference
 pyaar yaa prem ek shaashvat ehsaas he
 But his peas are quite deep
 asal jivan main behad gairajaruri lagane vaale factors bhi kai baar hamaare pyaar ko besahaara kar dete hai
 It is often impossible to return
 khaskar saalon baad, jo is kitaab kii lagbhag har kahani main badi hi aasaani se hota hua dikhaaya gaya he
 Which sometimes seems beyond the reality of our society and family
 iske baavjood kitaab kii kuch kahaniyaan behad sundar hai
 'phir Milenge, Tu Kuja Mana Kuja, Pratham Mili, Ghar Hamza and Zeenat, Train's Humsafar, Sanorita and the girl next door' are one of the interesting stories in the book
 ek ahm baat ye he ki radio par in kahaniyon ke shrota zyaadaatar yuva hai jo is daur se guzar rahe hote hai
 For them, these stories can be quite motivational
 lekin jo is daur se nikal kar aage bad chuke hai unke liye ye kahaniyaan boring or ripet si lagati hai
 The good thing about the book is its simple language and simple style
 agar ye kitaab is uddeshy se likhi gai he ki nai peedi main kahaniyon ke prati ruchi jagaai jaae to haa kitaab is maamle main tamaam sambhaavnaaon ko janm detii he
 Such spontaneous stories in Hindi are rarely read
 kitaab main kahaniyon se zyada jo baat acchhee he wo he lekhak kaa apni mandali har sadsy ko tavajjo or sabaki kahaniyon ko paryaapt jagah dena he
 This book succeeds in motivating the young people who are imprisoned in the grip of love to go ahead two weeks ahead of their comfort level
 kitaab ko aap apane book shelf main jagah dena chahenge yaa nahin, ye aapaki najar or pasand par nirbhar karata he

 kya yahi desh-videsh ke sitara cricketron se saji royal chalangers bengaluru kii team he? ipel10 ke antargat ravivaar ko aaarasibi kii ballebaaji kaa jis tarah se patan hua, use dekhte hue har kisi kii jubaan par yahi sawaal tha
 With the Bangalore bowlers bowling out to put Gautam Gambhir's Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team to 131, everyone was hopeful of Virat Kohli's victory
 lekin ballebaajon ne is maukey ko na sirf jaaya kiya balki apane aapako sharmasaar karne main bhi koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi
 The comments pehle over se hi aaarasibi ke wicket girane kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua, vah puri team ke out hone ke baad hi thama
 It seemed that the team from Bengaluru has been a victim of extreme confidence
 viraat kohli ke rup main team kaa pehla wicket gira, uske baad mandeep singh, abi divilliars, kedaar jadhav or kris gail jaise dhakad ballebaajon kii baari thi
 The batting was so disappointing that no batsman reached double runs
 teen ballebaaj viraat kohli, samual badri or yajuvendra chahal to khaataa bhi nahin khol paae
 This is the lowest ever IPL score
 isse pehle ipel kaa sabase kam score kaa record rajasthan royles ke naam tha
 Rajasthan's team collapsed in the year 2009 against Royal Challengers Bangalore team by scoring 58 runs
 aaj ke is behad kamjor pradarshan se bengaluru team ke prashansakon ko behad niraashaa hui he
 Obviously, after this embarrassing defeat, the challenge will be to raise the confidence of the Bangalore team to its height again
 nathan kulter nile ko unke gendbaaji pradarshan ke liye main of da match ghoshit kiya gaya
 He took three wickets for 21 runs in the match
 match ke baad viraat ko kohli ne sweekaar kiya ki ballebaaji ke behad sharmnaak pradarshan se unhen behad dukh hua he
 He said that we must forget this poor performance and move forward
 hamane aaj jis tarah kaa pradarshan kiya, usase kahin behatar team hai
 The series of RCB wickets started from the first over, only to end after the entire team was dismissed
 aisa laga ki bengaluru kii team ati aatmavishvaas kaa shikaar hui he
 The team's first wicket fell as Virat Kohli, followed by the dashing batsmen like Mandeep Singh, AB de Villiers, Kedar Jadhav and Chris Gayle
 ballebaaji itani niraashajanak raheen ki koi bhi ballebaaj dohari ransankhya tak nahin pahunch paaya
 Three batsmen Virat Kohli, Samuel Badri and Yajuvendra Chahal could not even open the account
 ipel kaa yah ab tak kaa nunatam score he
 Earlier, Rajasthan Royals had the lowest record of IPL scores
 rajasthan kii team varsh 2009 main royal chalangers bengaluru team ke khilaaf 58 ran banaakar dher ho gai thi
 The fans of the Bangalore team have been deeply disappointed by this very weak performance today
 jaahir he, is sharmnaak haar ke baad bengaluru kii team ke saamne apane aatmavishvaas ko phir oonchai par pahunchane kii chunauti hogi 
 Nathan Coulter Nile was declared man of the match for his bowling performance
 unhone match main 21 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 After the match, Virat was accepted by Kohli that he was deeply saddened by the extremely embarrassing batting performance
 unhone kaha ki hamen is kharaab pradarshan ko bhulaakar aage badhanaa hoga
 There are far better teams than the way we performed today
 nathan kulter nile ko unke gendbaaji pradarshan ke liye main of da match ghoshit kiya gaya
 He took three wickets for 21 runs in the match
 match ke baad viraat ko kohli ne sweekaar kiya ki ballebaaji ke behad sharmnaak pradarshan se unhen behad dukh hua he

 Ironically, this military parade was held to commemorate the end of World War II, which was dubbed the "peace Parade"
 parade ne chini sena par nigaah rakhane vaale paryvekshakon kaa dhyaan khinchaa, kyonki pehali baar yahaan 4,000 kimi tak maar karne vaali madhyam duuri kii deef-26 belistic missile kaa saarvajanik pradarshan hua
 The missile was named "guam Killer" because of its ability to reach the US Navy base in Guam
 iske alaava takreeban myth ban chuke “aircraft karier vidhvansak” deef-21di kaa bhi pradarshan kiya gaya, jo kuch logon ke mutabik, duniya kii pehali jahajarodhi belistic misile hai jinke vajood par lambey samay se videshi paryvekshak andeh jataate rahe the ki america ko bhram main daalane kii yah chini chaal bhar he
 The most surprising thing about this September parade however was that all of the Z19 antidote helicopters displayed, including long-range H-6 bombers and missiles and tanks, were all China-made
 yah sthiti do dashak pehle tak acolpaneey thi, jab yah desh hathiyaaron kaa sabase bada ayatak hua karata tha, jo darja aaj bharat ko hasil he

 The SIPRI report has seen tremendous changes in China's arms deals over the last ten years
 china kaa hathiyaar niryaat 2006-10 se 2011-15 ke bich 88 fisadi badha he or vah ab 37 deshon ko hathiyaar niryaat karne laga he
 These range from aircraft to missile frigates and anti-ship missiles

 How did the resurgence arise that how did China become a major manufacturer and exporter of modern weapons till two decades ago, especially dependent on the import of weapons from Russia? The PLA has a long history of arms manufacturing

 1989 proved to be a turning point in China after the Tiananmen Square massacre imposed a complete ban on the import of arms and high-tech goods through China from the Western world
 is vivashtaa main china ne apane puraane utpaadan model ko punerjeevit kiya or vah nae tareeke khojane laga kyonki vaishvik bazaar main uski pahunch khatm ho chuki thi
 Han Hua, a professor of international relations at Peking University and director of its Center for Arms Control and Disarmament, says, "china could not develop its homegrown technology so quickly without Bina Ban
 ”ek anya nirnaayak baat yah hui ki china ke tatkaaleen netaa deng jiyaao ping ne bing gongchaing ko fouj se alag karne kaa faisla le liya, saikadon aadim sainya utpaadan sanyantron ko band karvaa diya or sainya utpaadan ke liye vanijyik aadhaar par sarkaar kii ore se sanchalit vishaal nigam khol die
 Han says that after this, the military industrial sector in China was opened and he got an opportunity to draw better talent from the civilian sector and could continue to run profitable business ventures as well
 isane nabbe ke dashak main makul plateform taiyaar kar diya or ek dashak tak lagaataar vikaas or anusandhan main baari nivesh se yah kshetra “betahasha vruddhi kii sthiti” me aa gaya he
 The all-round change was possibly the most detailed study on the "wild growth" of China's domestic military industrial establishment, published in 2012 by the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (CAST)
 report main nishkarsh diya gaya tha ki is sadi ke pehle dashak main airospes or jahaaj nirmaan ke kuch kshetron main china “do peedi aage kii chalaang laga chukaa tha” jabaki haalia “nai sadi ke aane tak raksha praudyogiki aadim jamaane kii si thi
 “the study attributes this change to the founding of corporations such as China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) and China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC)
 in sarkari companiyon kaa istemaal vanijyik kaarobaaron ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 This was the key to their success: the capacity of defense production moved forward in step with China's economy
 masalan, siesassi duniya kii sabase badi vanijyik jahaaj banane vaali companiyon main shaamil ho gai or isane piele navy missile yudhpot tathaa malwahak jahaaj banane kii visheshgyata or buniyadi dhaanche ko bhi hasil kar liya
 China sells ships made in it to countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh
 shuruyaat main shipyard kaa nirmaan roosi sahyog or dizin se kiya gaya tha lekin is sadi kii shuruyaat main china apni kshamtaayen badhaane laga
 Since 2000, CSSC has built 22 dry docks (used in the construction of large ships) of length over 300 meters and six such docks that are 480 meters long
 ye milakar china kii dock kii kshamta ke maamle main duniya main sheersh par pahunchaate hai (sieesti ke mutabik, rus ke paas 300 meter lanbaa ek bhi dry dock nahin tha)
 If the first step was to increase production capacity, the second step was to develop the capacity for innovation and to adapt the design imported from Russia and Israel to China
 is maamle main china kaa record mila-jula rahaa he
 The success achieved in shipbuilding cannot be compared with aircraft, as China is still dependent on imports in terms of weapons systems, radars and aircraft engines
 masalan, paanchavin peedi ke desi jet vimaanon je20 or je31 ke nirmaan main mili simit kamyaabi ke chalate china ko do arab dollar kii laagat se rus se 35 sukhoi vimaan kharidne pade
 The deal reflects China's border on the one hand, and on the other hand, the importance of sharing modern technology with China despite Russia's long past of mistrust
 china ne agar kamyaabi ke saath koi vimaan niryaat kiya he to vah iklauta jeef-17 he jiskaa nirmaan pakistan ke saath milakar kiya ja rahaa he
 Increasing Steps China is yet to travel a long distance in terms of technology acquisition compared to USA and Russia but has made a good inroads into Asia's arms market
 pichley dashak ke dauraan beijing ne pakistan or bangladesh ko yudhpot niryaat kiye hai, kvayanmar or thailand ko jahajarodhi misile di hai or venezuela ko ladaaku vimaan die hai
 According to SIPRI, of the 555 modern combat aircraft exported between 2011-15, Russia has a share of 209, the US 175 and China 74
 pichley saal ke ant tak pandubbiyon ke die gaye 48 order main se china ko sabase zyada hissaa mila or use abhi das pandubbiyaan deliver kerani hai
 Eight of these will be given to Pakistan and two to Bangladesh
 vyapaar ke rujhaan dikhaate hai ki pichley dashak ke dauraan china kii hathiyaar bikri ne uski videsh niti ke agenda ko sanchalit kiya he
 The ease with which China has presented its side of export deals is not just a matter of trade
 china ne un deshon par zyada jor diya he jo yaa to uske kareebi padosi hai jaise dakshin or dakshin-purvi asia yaa phir africa or latin america desh, jinke china ke satat pratidwandvi america se tanaavpurn rishte hai
 China's "all-time friend" Pakistan has taken great advantage of this
 china ke beche hathiyaaron main ek-tihaai pakistan kharidta he jisamen vimaan, misile or yudhpot shaamil hai
 Myanmar and Thailand have also recently emerged as major buyers of China, including ships, ships, tanks, unmanned aerial aircraft and submarines
 peking uniwarsity kii haan hua kahati hai ki china ke beche jane vaale hathiyaaron kaa uski videsh niti se behad maamuli sambandh he
 She says, "the problem is that when you talk about the nexus mechanism, there are many countries as far as Japan and even South Korea that China does not sell its weapons
 ”isliye beijing ne bazaar main apni hissedari badhaane ke liye venuzuela jaise deshon par dhyaan diya he
 However, like most Chinese experts, Han does not consider this rise of Beijing to be significant yet and says that it is still far behind the US and Russia
 haalanki ve kahati hai ki gharelu sainya audyogic daayre kaa vikaas beijing kii ucch praathamikta rahegi
 This tune of Chinese leaders grew especially since 1999 when the US dropped a bomb on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in the Battle of Kosovo
 chini netaa is faisle par pahunche the ki har mahaan takat ke paas uski apni kshamtaayen honi chahie
 Han agrees
 ve kahati hai, “agar aap itihaas dekhen, to jang un deshon ne jiti he jinke paas saamne vaale ke mukaable apni sena ko las karne kii majboot kshamta rahi he
 Among them, hardly any countries have been dependent on imports of technology

 First of all, from Dream Girl and BJP MP Hema Malini, to know whether they have had trouble running the house after the ban
 saansad or celibrity hone ke saath vah bhi ek gruhinee hai
 Those who have to drive home

 But those who work at home
 naukar-chaakar or duusare log unako jo paisa dena hota he
 they did not have
 isliye thodi pareshaani jarur hui
 Hema feels the government's historic decision on demonetisation

 Therefore, after the note ban, they too have had to take money in the house for the expenses of the house
 sadhvi niranjan jyoti kaa kahana he ki vah to sadhu fakir hai, unako ghar chalaane ke liye khaas jarurat nahin hoti
 Wherever they are found, they make a living from there
 lekin bank se paise nikalwane ke baad kaaphi sukun mahasoos kar rahi hai
 Union Minister of State for Health Anupriya Patel also says that she is also a common citizen
 unako bhi jo thodi bahut pareshaani hui vah kuch khaas nahin he

 loksabhaa chunaav parinaam 2019 (lok Sabha Election Results 2019) ke antim rujhaan aa chuke hai, jisamen bhaajapa prachand bahumat ke saath jitati dikh rahi he
 The whole of India has always been eyeing the Congress stronghold Amethi seat and this time the possibility of a big upsurge cannot be ruled out
 amethi loksabhaa seat kaa yah record rahaa he ki aaj tak gandhi parivaar kaa koi bhi netaa amethi seat par haara nahin he or is baar record tut saktaa he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is standing in Amethi Lok Sabha seat, while it is facing bjp's favorite leader Smriti Irani
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main amethi se smriti irani, rahul gandhi se lagbhag 11,000 voton se aage chal rahi hai or yah pehali baar ho saktaa he ki congress se koi netaa amethi seat ganvaa saktaa he
 Let me tell you, the Congress (congress) has a golden past with the Amethi Lok Sabha seat and it started from 1967 when the Congress's Vidyadhar Vajpayee laid the foundation for the party's victory in Amethi
 1967-71 or 1971-77 tak vidhyadhar vaajapeyi amethi ke saansad bane rahe
 Ravindra Pratap Singh of the Janata Party remained the Amethi MP from 1977–80
 ab amethi kii bagdor asli rup se gandhi parivaar ke haath ai jab 1980 main sanjay gandhi congress kii ore se saansad chune gaye lekin durbhagyavash sanjay gandhi kii vimaan durghatana main maut ke baad yah jimmaa gandhi parivaar ke hi rajeev gandhi ko diya gaya
 Rajiv Gandhi remained the MP of Amethi seat from 1981 to 1991
 bam dhamaake main rajeev gandhi ke nidhan ke baad yah jimmedaari congress ke satish sharma ko saunpi gai, satish sharma ne amethi seat kii bagdor 1991 se lekar 1998 tak sanbhali or 1998 main bhaajapa ke sanjay sinha ne satish sharma ko amethi loksabhaa chunaav main shikast di
 This tenure could not go on too long and in 1999 Rajiv Gandhi's wife Sonia Gandhi defeated Sanjay Sinha in the elections and remained MP of Amethi from 1999-2004
 iske baad 2004 se abtak congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi amethi ke saansad bane hue hai
 Overall, no Congress leader has lost the Amethi seat till now, and now if Rahul Gandhi loses from his stronghold, he will be the first member of the Gandhi family to lose the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi

 In the first semi-final of the World Cup 2019, New Zealand has decided to bat first by winning the toss against Team India

 It will be a matter to be seen now
 manchester main mana jaataa he ki jo pehle ballebaaji karata he use phayda miltaa he

 In place of the expensive feed-in tariffs prevailing in countries like Germany and Spain, the Modi government played big bets on the reverse bid system already implemented under the NSM, which led to record-making prices and recently a bid in Rajasthan for electricity Rates 2

 The rate bids, however, do not reflect the 'real' cost of solar power

 Thus, even with the hidden expenses, the current price of solar power is now lower than the electricity rates from the new coal power stations (which is Rs 4)
 prati kilowat se upar he)
 In addition, the investment environment has improved rapidly as interest rates have come down

 Many new coal plants are operating at low capacity and running them further will not be a profitable deal

 After this, there is also the constraint of weak power demand in India, which is currently growing at 4-5% per annum, rather than the level of 7-8%, which was estimated by the power planners in the beginning
 agar maang sust rahati he to saura urja tabhi bad sakati he jab zyada se zyada puraane koyala bijlighar band ho jaaen

 'yogaguru baba ramdev ne kaha ki hamaara lakshya sampradayik yaa hindu bharat banane kaa nahin he, ham bharat or duniya ko aadhyatmik bananaa chaahate hai

 From the result of the investigation, it will be decided how serious Pakistan is in punishing the culprits of Mumbai attack, and then it will also decide what will be the next step of Obama warning Pakistan

 But i am sorry that anyone else's contribution to his victory can be denied

 Still will not be successful
 vaise bhi media ne modi kaa virodh hi zyada kiya he

 magar congress isamen bhi nuktachini karti he
 It is said that there is a crowd of mercenaries? Khurshid: We say that the people of India settled all over the world
 unhen vahaan kaa hissaa bananaa chahie
 But these pms are going to erect a wall again
 ki ye bhartiya hai or ye bhartiya nahin hai
 And there was talk of the charge of the mercenary crowd during Modi's show abroad
 to main aaj bhi apni baat par kaayam hum
 And i have got evidence of the mercenary crowd in Modi's show from BJP only
 ye baat or he ki main unhen yahaan lekar nahin aayaa
 Shahnawaz: Sir, keep another debate
 saare document lekar aaen or apni baat sabit karen
 Modi is your political opponent

 We may be harmed by the direction of this debate

 Even though living here

 Because the Modi government did not have the vision
 kabhi baatcheet kii baat karte hai, kabhi sthagit kar dete hai
 Shahnawaz: Pakistan is surrounded by its difficulties
 ham usase apni sharton par hi baat karenge
 Question: There is an opinion that Pakistan should leave aside and make better relations with other countries? Khurshid: They are elected government
 koi bhi niti apanaaen
 Which does not harm the country
 jab sahi samajhen saal do saal main
 State your policy as well
 lekin sach sach baat bataaen

 Claims to build hundreds of kilometers of roads are also made every day
 vikaas ko apana moolmantra bataate rajaneta thakte nahin, lekin jharkhand ke latehar jile ke gaanv naina kii tasviir bilkul ulat he
 Due to lack of road here, there is no place for people's problems
 agar durbhaagya se gaanv main koi biimaar pad jaae to aspataal le janaa pahaad par chadhane jaisaa hota he
 The nearest hospital to Naina village in Mahuadand block is 7 km away at Netarhat
 is puure kshetra conclaprabhavit mana jaataa he
 If someone falls ill in Naina village, the villagers have only one option to take him to the hospital
 or wo he bans kii tokari ko dandon se baandh kar biimaar ko usamen le janaa
 Looking at this scene, it seems that the administration is so insensitive about the basic facilities in this area
 gaanv ke logon ke mutabik kai baar biimaar ko aspataal pahunchaate hue itani der ho jaati he ki wo raste main hi dam tod detaa he
 Of course, it has been more than 16 years since Jharkhand was made, but the story of Naina village in Latehar tells a lot in itself
 sadak jaisi buniyadi suvidha ke abhaav ke bare main latehar ke upayukta pramod kumaar gupta se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone chuppi saadh lee
 Just replied that you have mentioned the problem, which will be followed by necessary steps

 Gujarat minister Ganpat Singh Vasava became eligible to condemn not only the Congress but also the state CM Vijay Rupani for the disputed statement comparing PM Modi and Rahul Gandhi
 unki vipakshi party congress ne hi nahin balki gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne bhi ninda kii he
 Rupani has also advised them to exercise restraint
 vasava isse pehle congress ke kuch samarthakon ke is daawey ko lekar nishaanaa saadh chuke hai ki gandhi ‘‘bhagwaan shiv ke avatar'' hai
 Vasava had asked Rahul Gandhi to prove this claim by drinking poison
 vasava ne shanivaar ko narmada jile ke dediapada main adivaasiyon kii ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘‘jab rahul gandhi kursi se uthte hai to aisa lagata he ki kute kaa baccha poonch hilaate hue khadaa hua he jo pakistan or china jayega yadi ve uski ore roti phenke
 During his address, he compared Prime Minister Modi to a lion
 congress pravaktaa manish doshi ne kaha ki vasava kii tippanee dikhaati he ki bijepi ko gujarat ke logon ne khaarij kar diya he
 Doshi said, "vasava has done injustice to the tribal community from which he comes
 unhen samajhnaa chahie ki aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal karne se unhen koi samarthan nahin milegaa jab tab vah yah nahin bataate ki unhone adivaasiyon ke liye kya kiya he
 "gujarat Congress in-charge Rajeev Satav said," This is the way the BJP works but the people of Gujarat have decided that they will stand with the Congress
 ''mukhyamantri roopaani ne bhi vasava kii tippanee se asahmati jataai or unase sanyam baratane ke liye kaha
 Rupani told reporters in Rajkot, "everyone should exercise restraint in the hot election environment
 shabdon kaa istemaal dridhtaa se kiya janaa chahie lekin kisi ko bhi aruchikar nijee bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 '' (from input language) bharat sarkaar ne is varsh bharat ratna ke liye mahaamanaa madanamohan malviya or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko chunaa he
 Every time it has been seen that as soon as the announcement of Bharat Ratna, long and wide controversies arise
 ikkaa-dukka bayanon ko chhod is baar aisa hota nahin dikhaa, jo saaf darshata he ki bharat ratna is baar supaatro ke naam ke pehle sushobhit hoga
 The root cause of the controversies that begin every year as soon as Vajpayee and Malaviya are announced the Bharat Ratna of Bharat Ratna are intellectuals
 taarikh gavaah he, bharatbhumi veeron or buddhijiviyon se kabhi khaali nahin rahi
 Here the heroes are so settled, that on the basis of the seven-day netpack alone, Greece, Egypt, Romans are erased and intellectuals so much that it is right to say 'netaji' or 'netaji' is encouraged to paint even four pages on this matter
 aap ek naam rakhiye or saamne se buddhijivi das or naam laakar poochhega bataao ye kyon nahin?bharat ratna par khadey hone vaale vivaad kii duusari vajah bharat kaa itihaas or samrudh bhugol rahaa he
 Such an old civilization, the country spread over a wide area and the determination to do anything for the country, there has always been a lot of things in every area and the emergence of great men in this country 
 or jab itnaa kuch karne ke baad kisi roj bharat ratna kii maang bhi kar di jaae, to sir hilaane ke pehle bhi sochna pad jaataa he
 This is not a problem with developed countries spread over three thousand five hundred kilometers, because they have only great men who can be counted on their fingers and there is no such practice of weighing great works in prizes
 desh kaa zyada mahaan hona bhi kabhi-kabhi musiibat ban jaataa he
 But the real reason for disputes is the aspirations of Indians
 atal ji ko bharat ratna milte na milte chaar jane peeche se mulaayam singh yadav or kanshiram kaa naam lekar aa jaayenge
 Some people raise the question that why Bharat Ratna is given to politicians every time? If you say that Sachin was a player, then the membership of Rajya Sabha will be shown in return

 He felt that the happier he is, the more his family will be
 us din unhen company kaa president banaaya gaya tha
 It was around 10 when she reached her home
 unki maa sidhiyon par hi unka intjaar kar rahi thim
 The impatient Indra told her mother that i have a very good news to tell you
 indra ko ummid thi ki maa bhi besabr ho jaaengi is khabar ko sunne ke liye lekin hua ulta hi
 His mother said to him instead of hearing the good news, i will hear your good news later, go and get milk first
 indra ne gairaaj main najar daudai
 Her husband's car was standing there
 unhone apni maa se poocha ki unke pati aaj ghar kitne baje aae
 The answer was that he had come at 8 o'clock
 indra ko bura laga or unhone unase poocha ki phir aapane unase doodh laane ko kyon nahin kaha
 His mother bluntly replied that he was tired
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki unke ghar main koi kaam karne vaala nahin tha
 When Indra said why not ask for servants, her mother replied that she had forgotten
 khayr ek acchhee beti kii tarah indra doodh lene to chali gayi
 But later on i complained to my mother that i wanted to give you a good news
 main company kii president ban gai hum or aapke liye doodh jaruri tha

 ye saare kirdaar tumhaare hi hai
 No one else can take this position
 isliye behatar yahi hoga ki tum apana president kaa taj vahiin offis main hi chhodkar aayaa karo

 His achievements are always minimized between household chores

 When your family is not involved in the success of work, then the happiness of achieving it also fades

 Maybe, you too have endured or are suffering this pain and if you are a man, think about your wife, sister and daughter once
 mahilaon ne offis main bhale apni ek pahchaan bana lee ho lekin ghar main wo aaj bhi sirf ek mashin kii tarah dekhi jaati hai

 He said that this does not benefit the village, poor and unemployed
 rahul gandhi ne yahaan congress kii 125veen vasharganth par ‘jan chetana yatra’ ko hari jhandi dikhaane ke baad upasthit jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue manaregaa yojana ko duniya kii sabase badi rojgarparak yojana bataate hue kaha ki isse sabase zyada phayda garibon or daliton ko hota he
 He said that the central government is giving thousands of crores of rupees to the Uttar Pradesh government under this scheme but does not know where this money is going
 kendra sarkaar dwaara uttar pradesh ke saath dohare maapdand apnaane ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki chaahe manaregaa yojana ho athwa bundelkhand ke vikaas ke liye kendra sarkaar dwaara hajaaron karod rupee ke package dene kii baat ho, is dhanrashi kaa paisa jameen tak nahin pahunch paa rahaa he
 He expressed surprise that this money of the center reaches Lucknow but this money is not reaching Ambedkar Nagar
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki desh main paise kii kami nahin he, garib ko vikaas kii mukhya dhara se kaise joda jaye yah ek ahm sawaal he
 Rahul said that the politics of religion and caste in Uttar Pradesh has lost the fleet of the state and that is why the states which were far behind Uttar Pradesh have gone ahead and Uttar Pradesh has gone behind
 rahul ne congress virdohi sabhi dalon ko gaanv or garib virdohi qaraar dete hue kaha ki desh main do vichaardhaaraon kii raajnneeti chal rahi he ek taraf congress kii vichaardhaara he jo gaanv or garib ko aage badhaane or unki shakti badhaakar desh kii unnati ke liye kaam karti he jabaki anya dalon kii rajnatik vichaardhaara shahar kii alag or gaanv kii alag he
 He attacked the Mayawati government of Uttar Pradesh, calling this government anti-dalit and Ambedkar
 rahul ne kaha ki main gaanv main isliye jaataa hum ki desh kii takat gaanv or garibon me basati he jabaki iskaa virodh karne waalon kaa najariya shaayad kuch alag he
 Responding to the economic compulsion being expressed by the Uttar Pradesh government regarding the implementation of the Right to Education Act, he said that Dalits are the best beneficiaries of this scheme and the BSP government says that the government has no money
 bundelkhand kaa ullekh karte hue rahul ne kaha ki hajaaron karod rupee kaa package yahaan ke vikaas ke liye kendra sarkaar dwaara diya gaya par jameen tak nahi pahunchaa
 Rahul Gandhi said that by pushing back the politics of religion and caste in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress will do politics of 'construction' by bringing the youth forward and removing unemployment will be our first goal
 unhone kaha ki aane vaale samay main uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti ab isi sawaal kaa jawaab talashne ke aadhaar par hogi
 He said that when we slowly started working with a positive attitude in Uttar Pradesh, it was said that the Congress is not there but when the Lok Sabha election results came out, people were surprised how the Congress got the most seats
 
 rahul ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main safalataa congress ko isliye mili kyonki hamane sahi sawaal janata ke bich jaakar uthaaye or in sawaalon ko ham aage bhi uthaate rahenge
 At the same time, he said that we will bring employment in the state with youth power and will also show development work so that the politics of the state will remain around these issues in the coming time
 ambedkar jayanti ke maukey par buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi ne congress chetana yatra kaa shubharambh bhi kiya
 This yatra will spread the history and achievements of the past and future plans of the Congress to the people from ten different parts of the state

 Today is the sixth day of Navratri and on this day, the sixth form of Mother Goddess i
e
 Mother Katyayani is worshiped
 kehete hai ki jisnemaa katyayanico prasann karke unki krupa praapt kar lee, usamen asambhav ko bhi sambhav karne kii shakti aa jaati he
 Devotees of Maa Katyayani are steadfast and achieve their goals
 aaj ham aapakoma katyayanice jude adbhut rahasyon ke bare main bataaenge, lekin sabase pehle jaan lete hai ki akhiramaa katyayanika swaroop kaisaa he
 
 
 Mother Katyayanika's body is shining like gold
 chaar bhujaaon vaalima katyayaniki sawari singh hai
 The mother has a sword in one hand and her beloved flower lotus in the other hand
 baaki do haath varmudra or abhyamudra main sushobhit hote hai
 It is said that devotees receive unfailing fruit by worshiping Mother Katyayani
 yani maa kii upasna kaa fal kabhi nasht nahin hota
 But do you know how Katyayani was born and why this form of Goddess was named Katyayani
 aaie ham aapako bataate hai
 
 
 The secret of the birth of mother Katyayani lived in a forest named Maharishi
 unka ek putr tha, jiskaa naam kaatya rakhaa gaya
 Maharishi Katyayan was born in the Katya gotra itself, but he had no child
 unki teevr kaamana thi ki maa bhagwati unako putree ke rup main praapt hon
 For this, Maharishi Katyayan did the harsh penance of Goddess Parvabha
 maharishi katyayan kii tapasya se prasann hokar devi paramba ne unhen vardaan diya or unki putree ke rup main prakat huin
 Being the daughter of Maharishi Katyayan, she was named Katyayani
 maa katyayanine hi aage chalakar rakshas mahisasur kaa vadh kiya tha
 Worship method- It would be best to worship the mother Katyayani by wearing yellow or red clothes - Offer yellow fragrant flowers and yellow naivedya to the mother Katyayani - Offering honey to the mother is especially auspicious - After this chant the mantra of the mother Katyayani, chant this mantra

 The first episode of the show aired last Sunday
 haalanki pehle episod ke baad se hi unke anprofeshnal ravaiye or laaparvaahee kii khabaren bhi aane lagi hai
 a report by Spotboy said that Rani Mukherjee kept waiting but Kapil canceled the shooting
 report ke mutabik kapil ke is ravaiye kii vajah se channel ko 30-35 lakh rupye kaa nuksaan hua he
 Seeing this attitude of Kapil, the channel has warned him
 reports ke mutabik channel ke ek adhikari ne kapil ko kade shabdon main warning di or kaha - yaa to aap vakt par shooting karen varanaa channel ke saath apana contract khatm karen
 Kapil canceled the shoot? The channel's loss of so many lakhs, his name and stardom in the industry is fading due to the ever increasing irresponsible actions of the film
 saath hi ve kai logon ko naaraaz bhi karte ja rahe hai
 Prior to canceling the shoot with Rani Mukherjee, there were reports of doing the same with Tiger Shroff
 lekin isapar kapil ne safai dete hue kaha tha ki tiger ke saath meraa koi shoot nahin tha, aise me use cancel karne kaa sawaal nahin uthta
 This is not the first time Kapil has canceled a shoot
 ve apane puraane sho main shahrukh khan, ajay devgan, akshay kumaar, vidya baalan ko set par ghanton intjaar kara chuke hai
 Tiger was never supposed to shoot for our 2nd episode, so shoot cancel hone ka sawaal hi paida nahi hota

 > Talking about the film, let us know that it is a franchise of the 2012 film Student of the Year
 student of da year main aalia bhatta, varun dhawan or siddharth malhotra ko launch kiya gaya tha
 This time, Karan Johar, Tara Sutaria and Ananya Pandey are Introducing
 student of da year-2 10 may ko film relies hogi
 The film is directed by Puneet Malhotra
 film main lav trengal bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 The life of college students will be shown in the film
 movie kaa trailor relies kiya ja chukaa he
 The trailer has not received much response on social media
 tirange main lipta smartphone, vah bhi maid in chaaina
 Yes, at first sight, the suspense about the 'freedom 251' mobile phone has revolutionized the market of the cheapest smartphone
 masalan, phone booking ke chaar maheene baad hi logon ke haath main aayega
 But the price and features with which this phone was launched, its price not only makes astonishing but also astonishing
 darasal, phone main jo khubiyaan hai vah aamtaur par chaar hajaar rupee kesmartfonmein hi milti he
 But what is the secret of this phone of just Rs 251, everyone is surprised about it from the technical expert to the consumer
 lekin jaraa thahrie, kyonki suspence or sawaalon ke bich jis adcom company ne ise banaaya he, uske naam ko phone par hi chipa diya gaya he
 Surely it is a surprise, but the fact that who made the phone has been hidden
 yahaan tak ki patrakaron ko rivyuu karne ke liye jo phone baante gaye, un par bhi stikar lagaakar diya gaya
 Reportedly, the marketing manager of the Chinese company Adcom, whose name is being taken to make it, told the media that he did not make this phone and he himself is investigating how his name was used
 
 nahin he koi manufaccharing unitoosraa suspence yah ki adcom naam kii ek bhartiya company bhi 2013 main saamne ai thi
 Its full name was Advantage Computers India Private Limited i
e
 Adcom and it launched the Adcom Thunder smartphone in 2013
 lekin ab suspence yahi he ki philhal ringing bels kii koi manufaccharing unit he nahin
 So in such a situation, the question is whether anyone made the phone, but it is almost certain that Chinese goods are installed in it
 kahin koi sabsidi to nahin?aglaa sawaal 'maid in china' ke maal ko bhartiya tirange ke aavaran main lapetakar bechney kii jarurat par he
 Because if it is a Chinese product, then why was it not sold in the same name? aakhir kise or kyon ise tirange ke rangane kii jarurat padi or agar ise bharat main hi banaaya jayega to indian celular association kaa maananaa he ki jab product par sidhe koi sabsidi nahin mili he, to yah itane kam rate par koi phone bech hi nahin saktaa
 Will the phone really come in hand? The cellular association is even saying that even if such a phone is sold on e-commerce or some kind of subsidized cell, it still costs Rs 3,500 to 3800
 phir sawaal yah bhi he ki 251 rupee main phone bechney vaali company abhi phone book kar jarur rahi he, lekin kya wo graahakon ko vastav main phone muhaiyaa kara paaegi
 Online sale of 'freedom 251' started on Thursday
 site par bikri shuru hui to har second chah lakh order bhi aae or isse shuruaati ghanton main hi site krash bhi ho gai
 The next question is how will this order be replenished, even when the company does not have a manufacturing unit
 kya sarkaar se he koi conection?aise main sawaal uthte hai ki kya bharat sarkaarringing belsako madad kar rahi he, kyonki buudhvaar ko noida main jab phone kii lonching hui to murali manohar joshi samet kai netaa maujuud the
 But the question is not only of help but also of quality and delivery
 baat tab or gambhir ho jaati he jab maamla sidhe taur par tirenge kii shaan kaa ho, jise phone ke baikacovar par lagaakar bhartiya hone kii duhai di ja rahi he or 'mek in india' kaa naaraa buland ho rahaa he

 ) It will now be necessary to provide the Aadhaar number for school children in the afternoon
 sarkaar ne mid de mile skim ke liye aadhaar jaruri kar diya he
 The Ministry of Human Resource Development has issued a notification saying that it will be mandatory to make Aadhaar card for the benefit of mid-day meal and has given time till June 30 for this
 is taarikh ke baad agar kisi bachche kaa aadhaar number nahin he to uske abhibhavak ko aadhaar registration slip dikhaani hogi taaki pataa chal sake ki aadhaar number ke liye aavedan kiya gaya he
 Under the Mid Day Meal Scheme, 12 crore children from 12 lakh schools in the country are served lunch
 is yojana par sarkaar salanaa kareeb saadhe nau hajaar karod rupee kharch karti he
 Children up to class VIII get food under this scheme
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar tamaam suvidhaayen aadhaar number se jod rahi he
 She says that she wants to stop this fraud
 lekin saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki mid de mile jaisi yojana main aadhaar ko jaruri bananaa bahut galat he, kyonki isse desh ke bahut garib or jaruratmand bachche iske phaayde se maharoom rah jaaenge
 "this is not the way to prevent fraud
 use rokane ke liye sarkaar ko yojana ko umdaa tareeke se lagu karana chahie taaki adhik se adhik bachche skool aaen
 We have seen that where people are participating in the scheme and it is going well, there is no scope for any disturbances
 jahaan tak aadhaar kaa sawaal he hamane dekha he ki kis tarah peedies or manaregaa jaisi yojanaon kaa phayda logon ko nahin mil rahaa kyonki unke finger print match nahin karte

 Amrita Johri, associated with the campaign, said, "even after such clear guidelines of the Supreme Court, the government is bringing Aadhaar in every scheme where the poor can benefit
 aisa lagata he ki sarkaar aadhaar kii aad main laagon ko saamaajik kshetra kii yojanaon se vanchit karnaa chaahati he
 " mid de mile skim ke tahat desh main 12 lakh skulon ke 12 karod bacchon ko dopaher kaa khaanaa diya jaataa he
 The government spends about nine and a half thousand rupees annually on this scheme
 aathvin tak ke bacchon ko is yojana ke tahat khaanaa miltaa he
 Significantly, the government is linking all facilities with the Aadhaar number
 uskaa kahana he ki vah isse farjivada rokna chaahati he
 But social workers say that it is very wrong to make Aadhaar necessary in a scheme like Mid Day Meal, as it will leave the very poor and needy children of the country unaware of its benefits

 tabhi se is baat kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai, haalanki baad main videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha tha ki abhi kisi tarah kaa faisla nahin liya gaya he
 Now when Imran Khan is holding this cabinet meeting on Tuesday, a decision can be taken on this issue
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi balakot airstrike ke vakt pakistan ne bharat ke liye apana airspes band kiya tha, tab kuch dinon ke andar hi pakistan ko 600 karod rupee se adhik kaa ghaataa hua tha
 This is the reason that many voices are being raised in Pakistan itself that Imran Khan's government should not take such a decision, because it will put more burden on the falling economy
 imran khan kii cabinet baithak us vakt ho rahi he, jab pakistan kii ore se rojaanaa parmaanu yuddh kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 It is also worth noting that Pakistan constantly threatens to stop nuclear threat and airspace, but recently when Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi was returning to his homeland from France after attending G-7 summit, Had passed haalanki, pakistan lagaataar in gidadbhabhakiyon par apana rukh badalata aayaa he
 Because it was previously said by Imran Khan that the situation between the two countries could lead to nuclear war, later he said that Pakistan would never take the first attack
 phir somvaar raat ko hi pakistani videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa mohammad faisal ne twit kar kaha tha ki imran khan ke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he, parmaanu hamale kii niti par pakistan ne apana rukh nahin badla he
 The train will pass through the dense greenery area of the Konkan belt, giving an enchanting view of the sea shore, mountains and valleys so that you will enjoy your journey and not just reach the destination ie Goa
 haalanki kuch badmaashon ne train ke sanchaalan se pehle hi isaki khidakiyon ko todphod diya he,lekin adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki hamane is par sangyaan liya he or ab yah koi mudda nahin he
