 Nadia says, "before getting married he used to tell me that i am very beautiful, and used to praise me a lot, but when we got married, he used to tell me that i have worn a cheap dress, and thus He slowly started to take over my confidence
 
 
 " He was an Indian businessman, so both used to come to Mumbai again and again
 
 
 is baat ne bhi unke rishte par asar daalaa
 
 
 When their first child, daughter Insiya, was born after three years of marriage, the situation worsened
 
 
 nadia kahati hai, "jab maine insia ko janm diya, vah sirf chaar din baad bacchee ke saath mujhe akelaa chhodkar chalaa gaya
 
 
 Six weeks after the birth of our daughter, moving to Mumbai resumed, but it was very difficult
 
 
 navjaat bachche ke saath safar karnaa bahut zyaada thakaa diya karata tha, or jab tak insia chah maheene kii hui, ham chah se bhi zyaada baar bharat ja chuke the
 
 
 " nadia ke mutabik, uske pati ne bacchee ko paalane main kabhi madad nahin kii
 
 
 She says that she always felt that she was the only one raising a child despite being married
 
 
 iske alaava bacchee ke baad nadia kaa pati gaali-galouj bhi karne laga, or shaareerik hinsa bhi, lekin is bare main nadia ne kisi ko nahin bataaya
 
 
 Nadia writes, "whenever he used to beat me, he always came the next day and expressed regret, apologized, and said that he had made all the mistake
 
 
 vah vaada karata tha ki vah badal jayega
 
 
 He used to say that as a human being i am much better than that, and that is why i should forgive him
 
 
 main tab bhi hamaari pariktha jaisi premakahani main yakeen karti thi, so, main use maukey detii gai, lekin jo aadmi ek baar aap par haath uthaa detaa he, vah baar-baar haath uthayega hi
 
 
 " iske baad nadia ne talaak ke liye arzi daakhil kar di, lekin pati ko unki beti se mulaakaat karne se kabhi nahin roka, or chaahati thi ki vah insia kii zindagi kaa hissaa bana rahe
 
 
 Nadia wrote, "one day he came, and placed Insia on his lap and said that he would send his friends, so that they would kill me
" 
 
 main uski taraf gai, or insia ko uski god se lekar sidhe police stesan gai, or shikaayat darj karwaai
 
 
 "but even after this the threats did not stop
 
 
 yahaan tak ki nadia ko apni car ke neeche jeepies trek and tres upkaran bhi laga mila
 
 
 The police also put AWARE system on Nadia's body so that the police could reach her as soon as possible due to an emergency
 
 
 nadia kahati hai, "iske baad ke maheenon main hamaare bich kanoonee mukademe chalate rahe, lekin is dauraan meri car ke neeche trek and tres upkaran lage milte rahe
 
 
 He continued to lose the case, and the judge decided that i should be the chief custodian of our daughter and take care of her legally
 
 
 isse uske ahm ko chot pahunchi, or iske jawaab main usne logon ko bataanaa shuru kiya ki main hamaari beti ke saath bura bartaav karti hum
 
 
 i was scared all the time, and the purpose was to break me
 
 
 " After this, everything looked calm for some time, but on September 29, Nadia's worst fears proved true
 
 
 insia ko apni maa ke paas chhodkar nadia kahin ja rahi thim ki achaanak unhen bhattije kaa phone aayaa ki kuch log unki beti ko chhinakar le gaye hai
 
 
 She says, "since then my life has become like a nightmare
 
 
 zindagi main kabhi-kabhi aapkaa din bura bitta he, lekin jab aap agle din sokar uthte hai, sab thik ho chukaa hota he, lekin meraa bura sapana khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa he
 
 
 " nadia ko jaankaree mili ki uskaa purv pati insia ko pehle germany or phir bharat le gaya tha
 
 
 She says, "I haven't been able to talk to my daughter since the day she was kidnapped
" 
 
 meri lakh koshishon ke baavjood vah (purv pati) meri do saal kii beti se meri baat nahin karwaata
 
 
 "comments ab apni beti ko talashne tathaa use waapas hasil karne ke liye nadia zamin-aasmaan ek kiye hue he
 
 
 She explains, "together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government of Holland, we are doing our best to get Insia back
" 
 
 har rose subah se raat tak main isi ke liye kaam kar rahi hum, or main tab tak nahin rukuungi, jab tak main apni beti ko waapas apni baahon main nahin paa leti

 He later kidnaps their two-year-old daughter and takes them to Mumbai, and she has been struggling to regain her daughter since then
 
 
 nadia ne kaha, "jis din hamaari shaadi hui, sab kuch badal gaya
 
 
 "according to Nadia, before marriage" he used to take great care of me, and always gave me very high status
 
 
 " Nadia and her very loving boyfriend married in 2011, and soon after that she turned into a 'dictator' husband
 
 
 nadia kahati hai, "shaadi hone se pehle vah mujhase kaha karata tha ki main bahut khubasurat hum, or meri bahut tarif kiya karata tha, lekin jab hamaari shaadi ho gai, tab vah mujhase kahata tha ki maine ghatiya poshaak pahani he, or is tarah usne dhire-dhire meraa aatmavishvaas khatm karnaa shuru kar diya
 
 
 " vah bhartiya vyapaaree tha, so, donon baar-baar mumbai aayaa karte the
 
 
 This also affected their relationship
 
 
 teen saal kii shaadi ke baad jab unki pehali santan, beti insia, paidaa hui, to halaat zyaada bighad gaye
 
 
 Nadia says, "when i gave birth to Insia, he left me alone after four days with the baby girl
" 
 
 hamaari beti ke paidaa hone ke chah hafte baad mumbai aana-janaa phir shuru ho gaya, lekin vah behad mushkil tha
 
 
 Traveling with a newborn child was very tiring, and by the time Insia was six months old, we had gone to India more than six times
 
 
 " According to Nadia, her husband never helped to raise the child
 
 
 vah kahati hai ki unhen hameshaa aisa lagata tha ki vah shaadishuda hone ke baavjood akeli hi bacchee ko paal rahi hai
 
 
 Apart from this, after the girl, Nadia's husband started abusing her, and also physical violence, but Nadia did not tell anyone about this
 
 
 nadia likhti hai, "jab bhi vah mere saath maar-peet karata tha, agle din aakar hameshaa afsos jataata tha, maafee maangata tha, or kahata tha ki sari galati uski kii thi
 
 
 He promised that he would change
 
 
 vah kahata tha ki insaan ke taur par main usase kahin behatar hum, or isliye mujhe use maaf kar dena chahie
 
 
 i still believed in our fairytale-like love story, so i kept giving her a chance, but the man who once raised his hands on you, will raise his hands again and again
 
 
 " Nadia then filed an application for divorce, but never stopped her husband from meeting her daughter, and wanted her to remain a part of Insiya's life
 
 
 nadia ne likhaa, "ek din vah aayaa, or insia ko apni god main bithakar bolaa ki vah apane doston ko bhejega, taaki ve mujhe maar daalen
 
 
 i went to her side, and took Insia from her lap and went straight to the police station, and lodged a complaint
 
 
 " lekin iske baad bhi dhamkiyaan milani band nahin huin
 
 
 Nadia even found GPS track and trace equipment under her car
 
 
 police ne nadia ke sharir par AWARE system bhi lagaaya, taaki koi emergency hone par police jald se jald uske paas pahunch sake
 
 
 Nadia says, "in the months that followed, legal litigation continued between us, but during this time track and trace equipment were found under my car

 "according to Nadia, before marriage" he used to take great care of me, and always gave me very high status
 
 
 " Nadia and her very loving boyfriend married in 2011, and soon after that she turned into a 'dictator' husband
 
 
 nadia kahati hai, "shaadi hone se pehle vah mujhase kaha karata tha ki main bahut khubasurat hum, or meri bahut tarif kiya karata tha, lekin jab hamaari shaadi ho gai, tab vah mujhase kahata tha ki maine ghatiya poshaak pahani he, or is tarah usne dhire-dhire meraa aatmavishvaas khatm karnaa shuru kar diya
 
 
 " vah bhartiya vyapaaree tha, so, donon baar-baar mumbai aayaa karte the
 
 
 This also affected their relationship
 
 
 teen saal kii shaadi ke baad jab unki pehali santan, beti insia, paidaa hui, to halaat zyaada bighad gaye
 
 
 Nadia says, "when i gave birth to Insia, he left me alone after four days with the baby girl
" 
 
 hamaari beti ke paidaa hone ke chah hafte baad mumbai aana-janaa phir shuru ho gaya, lekin vah behad mushkil tha
 
 
 Traveling with a newborn child was very tiring, and by the time Insia was six months old, we had gone to India more than six times
 
 
 " According to Nadia, her husband never helped to raise the child
 
 
 vah kahati hai ki unhen hameshaa aisa lagata tha ki vah shaadishuda hone ke baavjood akeli hi bacchee ko paal rahi hai
 
 
 Apart from this, after the girl, Nadia's husband started abusing her, and also physical violence, but Nadia did not tell anyone about this
 
 
 nadia likhti hai, "jab bhi vah mere saath maar-peet karata tha, agle din aakar hameshaa afsos jataata tha, maafee maangata tha, or kahata tha ki sari galati uski kii thi
 
 
 He promised that he would change
 
 
 vah kahata tha ki insaan ke taur par main usase kahin behatar hum, or isliye mujhe use maaf kar dena chahie
 
 
 i still believed in our fairytale-like love story, so i kept giving her a chance, but the man who once raised his hands on you, will raise his hands again and again
 
 
 " Nadia then filed an application for divorce, but never stopped her husband from meeting her daughter, and wanted her to remain a part of Insiya's life
 
 
 nadia ne likhaa, "ek din vah aayaa, or insia ko apni god main bithakar bolaa ki vah apane doston ko bhejega, taaki ve mujhe maar daalen
 
 
 i went to her side, and took Insia from her lap and went straight to the police station, and lodged a complaint
 
 
 " lekin iske baad bhi dhamkiyaan milani band nahin huin
 
 
 Nadia even found GPS track and trace equipment under her car
 
 
 police ne nadia ke sharir par AWARE system bhi lagaaya, taaki koi emergency hone par police jald se jald uske paas pahunch sake
 
 
 Nadia says, "in the months that followed, legal litigation continued between us, but during this time track and trace equipment were found under my car

 main uski taraf gai, or insia ko uski god se lekar sidhe police stesan gai, or shikaayat darj karwaai
 
 
 "but even after this the threats did not stop
 
 
 yahaan tak ki nadia ko apni car ke neeche jeepies trek and tres upkaran bhi laga mila
 
 
 The police also put AWARE system on Nadia's body so that the police could reach her as soon as possible due to an emergency

 " After this, everything looked calm for some time, but on September 29, Nadia's worst fears proved true
 
 
 insia ko apni maa ke paas chhodkar nadia kahin ja rahi thim ki achaanak unhen bhattije kaa phone aayaa ki kuch log unki beti ko chhinakar le gaye hai
 
 
 She says, "since then my life has become like a nightmare

 Nadia then filed an application for divorce, but never stopped her husband from meeting her daughter, and wanted her to remain a part of Insiya's life

 Nadia even found GPS track and trace equipment under her car

 Uncle Shivpal Yadav, who was sidelined in the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, is not yet ready to open his political cards
 sapa adhyaksh or bhattije akhilesh yadav se unki baat banati hui bhi najar nahin aa rahi he
 Not only this, he still does not have much expectations from Mulayam Singh
 aise main shivpal holi ke baad apane nae raajnneetik thikaane par faisla le sakate hai
 Please tell that during the era of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Shivpal used to speak in the SP
 unhen mulaayam kaa hanuman kaha jaataa tha
 He was the chief strategist of the SP, and at times became a troubleshooter
 bina unki marji ke party main patta bhi nahin hilta tha
 The displeasure of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav took such a political turn that today he has been sidelined in the party
 chachaa-bhattije ke bich kadavahazkhilesh or shivpal ke bich rishte kii kadavaahat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 More than a year of political enmity between uncle and nephew has passed, but the matter has not been reached yet
 jabaki shivpal ne ek tarah se akhilesh ke aage sarender tak kar diya he
 Even after this, Shivpal has not been able to get back his lost existence in the party
 sapa pramukh akhilesh or mulaayam singh se koi behatar nattejey naa paakar shivpal ab nae siyaasi thikaane kii talash main jute gaye hai
 Options are open to him from Congress to BSP
 shivpal ke kareebi kii maane to ve apana faisla karne se pehle soobe kii raajnneetik nabj ko samajhane main jute hai

 shahid ne 'ajtak' se baat karte hue kaha ki shivpal yadav ko said line karke vidhansabha chunaav main party khamiyaja bhugat chuki he
 SP does not exist without Shivpal
 shivpal ke prati akhilesh kaa yahi ravaiya rahaa to sapa se alag hokar wo apana siyaasi kadam uthaa sakate hai
 Shivpal has his own political base and stature in the state
 sutron kii maane to shivpal kisi bhi party kaa daaman thaamne se pehle raajnneetik mizaaj ko samajhane main lage hai
 He has discussed both Congress and BSP options with his close ones
 isi maddenjar congress netaaon ke sang unki baatcheet kaa silsilaa bhi jari he
 The Congress has been fighting hand in hand for the last three decades to regain its lost political ground in Uttar Pradesh, to engage veteran leaders in UP
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kii ladaai ke liye congress acchhee tarah jaanati he ki uttar pradesh main majboot hona kitna jaruri he
 In such a situation, the Congress wants to play bets by joining the outside leaders along with their Khanty leaders
 nasimuddin ke baad shivpal par najarabispi pramukh mayawati ke daahine haath rahe nasimuddin siddiki ko congress party main shaamil karaane ke baad ab shivpal ko paale main laane kii jugat lagi rahi he
 At the same time, Shivpal is busy negotiating his stature and position in the Congress
 sutron ke mutabik shivpal ne congress se pradesh adhyaksh pad kii ichha jataai, jis par congress alaakaman sahamat nahin he
 According to sources, Shivpal wants to make the Congress his base compared to the BSP

 Laxman said, 'the important thing is how much time he spends at the crease and how well he plays innings
 yadi ve 80 gendon par 100 ran banaate hai to isamen dikkat nahin he
 The faster you score runs, the more chances the bowler has of picking up wickets
 ’lakshmana se poocha gaya ki kya virendra sahvaag jaise cricketron kii vishwa cap se pehle team main vaapasi honi chahie, unhone kaha, ‘ham jaanate hai ki ve behtareen khilaadi or match vijeta hai
 But we will have to wait and see how they perform in the domestic season

 There have also been incidents when no express or passenger train has reached its destination station, but the railway system is showing that train has already arrived

 sahi soochna milane se bhartiya railway apni yojanaon ko sahi tareeke se lagu kar paaegaa
 The Prime Minister's Wednesday visit to Shimla was unique in many ways
 raajnneetik taur par himachal pradesh ke kisi mukhyamantri ke shapath grahan samaaroh main pehali baar koi pradhanmantri shaamil hua

 lekin indian coffee house unki prashansa se gadgad he
 The manager of the coffee house hopes that the Prime Minister will come and drink coffee here in the future

 The President said that the wave of a 'charismatic' leader capable of winning elections is usually revealed when the elections are over
 unhone kaha, ‘koi netaa karishmai he yaa nahin, yah baat uski vot hasil karne kii kshamta par nirbhar karata he
 i can say that as a political activist we speak in elections, but the wave is known only when elections are held
 jab yah aati he yaa jab hawa bahati he tab koi bhi yah nahin kah saktaa ki hawa yaa lahar kahaan bah rahi he

 On 15 August last year, there was a dispute over the hoisting of the tricolor by Bhagwat in Kerala
 aresas sadasyon ne kaha ki 26 janvari ko kerala main palakkad jile ke bahari kshetra sthit ek skool main tirangaa jhanda fahraaya jayega
 The RSS will host a three-day camp from 26 January
 bhagwat is shivi main hissaa lene ke liye kerala main rahenge
 a senior Sangh official said, 'wherever the RSS heads are on Independence Day and Republic Day, they hoist the national flag
 vah 26 janvari ko kerala main rahenge or vahaan tirangaa fahraayenge
 It should be seen only in this context
 ’aresas sadasyon ne kaha ki jis skool main aresas ke kaarykram kaa aayojan ho rahaa he uskaa prashasan aresas ke bhartiya vidya bhawan ke adheen he
 An official said that the RSS is a national organization and celebrating these national days is part of its culture
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat ne beete varsh 15 agast ko kerala ke palakkad jile ke ek skool main tirangaa fahraaya tha
 However, the DM there refused to do so
 dm kaa aadesh tha ki koi bhi rajaneta skool main tirangaa naa fahraae
 Even then it was done
 sthaneey dm kaa aadesh tha ki us skool main koi bhi teacher yaa koi chunaa hua vyakti hi tirangaa fahraae
 The officer said, 'it was very unfortunate that last year the state government had ordered the school not to allow them to hoist the flag
 ’ gauratlab he ki bijepi or aresas pichley kaaphi samay se kerala main apni paith banane ko juty hai
 There has also been an increase in cases of attacks and assassination of Sangh workers in Kerala
 aresas ne pehali baar 2002 main nagpur main tirangaa fahraaya tha
 BJP national president Amit Shah has also voiced several times in public forums about accidents against BJP leaders in Kerala
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehlebijapi se gathjodkii koshish main jute purv kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki wo secular hai or ise sabit karne kii jarurat nahin he
 The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) also made known its 'complaint' to Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 paswan ne yah bhi kaha ki gathbandhan ke vikalp khule hai or is bare main 3-4 dinon main faisla kar liya jayega
 Paswan told reporters, 'our alliance with RJD was not given importance
 main sonia gandhi or si pi joshi se do-do baar mila tha
 i got the answer that the Congress will decide the seats after December 31
 lekin kuch nahin hua
 He further said, "ram Vilas Paswan is a secular, there is no need to prove it
" gujarat dangon ke vakt maine cabinet se istipha de diya tha
 After the party parliamentary board meeting, Paswan said that the meeting was called to consider an alliance with the BJP
 ramvilas ke bete chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'purana gathbandhan khatm ho jane ke baad ab hamaare sabhi vikalp khule hai
 We are exploring options because we are not happy with the current alliance

 2
 How much sleep you get? How much sleep you are getting at night can also be a reason for not losing weight

 If you are not sleeping well, this can also be a major cause of weight loss
 3
 Do you take alcohol? If you are dieting, then you need to take special care that you give up alcohol completely
 alcohol aapke sharir ke fat ko bern nahin hone detaa he jisaki vajah se aapaki dieting beasar ho jaati he
 Is this not the reason for your weight loss? 4
 Do you swallow food quickly? Does chewing food just seem like a task and to avoid it, you swallow food quickly? If this is the case then change your habit immediately
 aisa karne se aap zyada khaanaa kha jaaengi or aapako ehsaas bhi nahin hoga
 5
 kya aap keval dieting hi kar rahi hai?kai mahilaayein aisi hoti hai jinhen ye lagata he ki dieting kar lene se hi unka extra fat nikal jayega
 But it is not so
 dieting ke saath hi jaruri he ki aap vyaayaam ko bhi puri praathamikta den

 The Yogi government of UP is going to take a unique initiative for those who become insane after drinking alcohol
 nagarikon ko sharaab pine kaa surakshit tarika bataane ke liye sarkaar jald hi –risponsible drinking policy laane kii taiyaari main he
 Last year, soon after the formation of the BJP government in UP, many organizations had strongly demanded to implement liquor ban on the lines of Bihar
 chunki bhaajapa sarkaar ko kisaan rin maafee or anya chunavi yojanaon ko lagu karne ke liye dhan kii jarurat thi isliye vah sharaab bandi kar aabkaari rajasav ke rup main khajaane ko milane vaale 14 hajaar karod rupye kaa nuksaan karne kaa jokhim nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi
 The Yogi government, which is going to present the second budget, will now tell the people how to drink alcohol in moderation
 chunki sarkaar agle varsh ke liye aabkaari rajasav main kam se kam das fisadi kaa ijapha karne kaa plan bana chuki he, aise main vah sharaab kii bikri kam hone ke tareekon se bhi bachanaa chaahati he
 The draft of the proposed Responsible Drinking Policy is in the final stages and will soon be placed in the Cabinet for approval
 iske mutabik sarkaar kul aabkaari rajasav kaa kam se kam ek fisadi hissaa sharaab pine ke surakshit taur tareekon ke prati logon ko jaagruk karne main kharch hoga
 UP tops the country in alcohol-related accidents
 yahaan par 18 fisadi sadak haadase sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane se ho rahe hai
 Not only this, UP is the highest in cases of liver cancer caused by drinking alcohol
 nai niti laakar sarkaar gaavon, mohallon, skool kalejon main nukkad naatakon, goshtiyon or anya tareekon se logon ko sharaab ke bare main jaagruk karegi
 However, the biggest challenge before the government will be to not let the fate of its campaign be like other alcoholic prohibition programs

 The crisis in indigo, the country's largest airline, probably began because of a fight over management control in the company and there were differences among promoters regarding the expansion strategy
 guuruuvaar ko yah khabar ai thi ki indigo ke donon sansthaapakon rahul bhaatia or rakesh gangwal ke bich matbhed chal rahe hai
 After the news, Indigo Airlines parent company Interglobe Aviation shares price 10
 5 fisadi kii giravat aa gai
 Rahul Bhatia's 38 in the company
 26 fisadi or rakesh gangwal kii 36
 69% stake
 iconomic times ke anusaar, lagbhag baraabar hissedari ke baavjood board or management par bhaatia kaa zyada niyantran tha
 His holding company Inter Globe Enterprises (IGE) has the right to appoint key management positions such as Chairman, MD, CEO and President
 register of companyj ko di gai jaankaree ke mutabik is company ko teen swatantra nideshkon kii niyukti kaa bhi adhikaar tha, jisamen se ek aaajeevan ritair nahin hote the
 On the other hand, the Rakesh Gangwal (RG) group has the right to appoint only a non-retiring, non-independent director
 ijii group kaa matlab interglobe enterprijej, rahul bhaatia, unki patni rohinee or unke pita kapil hai
 Gangwal and his wife Shobha, Kayalam Investments and Chinkarpu Family Trust in RG Group
 articals of association (aoa) ke dwaara bhi company par ijii ko sanchaalanaatmak niyantran mila hua he
 However, it is not easy for both the promoters to get out of this business
 company ke shareholders agreement main kaha gaya he, 'koi bhi sadsy arji group yaa ijii group, yadi apane share kisi tisare paksh ko transfar karne kaa prastaav rakhata he, share bazaar yaa share main kisi purv nirdhaarit bikri ke alaava, to duusare group ko is prastaav ko pehle asweekaar karne kaa adhikaar hoga

 'gauratlab he ki desh kii sabase badi airlines indigo ke do sansthaapakon ke bich gambhir matbhed kii khabaren guuruuvaar ko ain
 It was said that if these differences were not resolved, then the functioning of indigo Airlines after Jet could also be affected
 indigo desh hi nahin, duniya kii sabase teji se badhane vaali airlines main se he or iske peeche mukhya force america aviation industry main kaam kar chuke rakesh gangwal ko mana jaataa he
 It is because of Gangwal that indigo has placed a record number of aircraft orders and is aggressively expanding its operations in India
 america naagarik ban chuke gangwal parde ke peeche rahakar kaam karte hai, jabaki rahul bhaatia bharat main airlines ke growth or niyamit kaamkaaj ko dekhte hai
 This difference was seen on several occasions in the last two years
 isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki gangwal jahaan teji se airlines ko badhanaa chaahate hai, vahiin bhaatia thodaa satark rahakar aage badhane main bharosa karte hai
 If indigo is in any kind of crisis, it will be a terrible situation for the Indian aviation market, because before that we have seen the destruction of two private airlines Kingfisher and Jet Airways

 Because the reality of insurance is in the details of the policy and not in the premium
 shanivaar 9 may ko kolkata main pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana, pradhanmantri jivan jyoti yojana or atal pension yojana ko kaaphi bhavy tareeke se launch kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister said that 80 to 90 percent of the population has no insurance
 bharat sarkaar ne 15 agast se 26 janvari ke bich jandhan ke tahat 15 karod nae khate khole
 Today 95 percent of the people of the country have joined the bank
 in 15 karod khate main garib logon ne 15 hazaar 800 karod rupee jamaa kar diye
 The Prime Minister did not say that half of these 15 crores is not a money in the account, yet it is not a normal success
 yah baat isliye kahi ki jin logon ke khate main ek paisa nahin he ve nai yojana ke tahat premium kii raashi kahaan se denge
 Will the government give pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is banking ke kaaran hi suraksha kavach kii yojanaon lagu ho rahi hai
 From May 1, these schemes started on a trial basis and by May 9, more than 5 crore people had registered, when the Prime Minister was launching the scheme, i also got an SMS from my bank that a premium of Rs 330 will be taken from your account
 You SMS the name of the nominee to the number
 automatic tareeke se meraa bhi beemaa ho gaya or pradhanmantri ke khate main main bhi gina gaya
 Except the Atal Pension Yojana, this is the third public insurance scheme of the Modi government
 jandhan yojana main bhi durghatana main marane yaa sharir ke kisi hisse ke kshatigrast hone par ek lakh rupee kaa beemaa cover he to prakritik maut ke baad 30,000 kaa beemaa he
 Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, only the accounts of the poor or the rich are not clear
 jandhan ke tahat durghatana beemaa he hi to do-do nai beemaa yojana kyon launch kii gai
 None of these schemes will get money for treatment expenses
 pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana main durghatana main maut yaa sharir kaa koi ang bekaar hone par beemaa milegaa
 If one hand, one leg and one eye go into the accident, then one lakh rupees will be found
 donon haath, donon paanv chale jaaen to do lakh kaa beemaa milegaa
 People between 18 and 70 years will get benefit of this scheme
 har saal maatr 12 rupee premium dene honge
 It will have to be renewed every year
 pradhanmantri jivan jyoti yojana main 18 se 50 saal ke logon ko beemaa cover milegaa
 After death due to any reason, the family of the insurance holder will get two lakh rupees
 pratidin ek rupee ke hisaab se saal main 330 rupee kaa premium dena hoga
 But policy will be given only after giving 330 rupees together
 har saal is policy kaa navinikaran karana hoga
 If you have three accounts then you cannot take three insurance

 According to the information found in the official website of in / name, the insurance holder also has to keep in mind that life protection insurance will be over as soon as 70 years of age
 agar tab tak mrityu nahin hoti he to aapako koi paisa nahin milegaa
 You can avail the Jeevan Jyoti plan by paying premium till the age of 55 years
 beemaa kii raashi tabhi milegi jab mrityu hogi yaa durghatana ke shikaar honge
 This means that the premium of Rs 330 went waste for 37 years
 isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Just you have to know that this insurance is accident insurance
 aam taur par ham jo jivan beemaa karaate hai hamen turm khatm hone ke baad premium kii raashi se dedh se do guna yaa paanch guna raashi milti he
 The government will get the amount in the new insurance scheme, but not after the accident or death
 isi ke saath ek pension yojana bhi launch hui he
 Atal Pension Yojana 18 se 40 saal kii umr ke yuva hi is beemaa ke paatr honge jiskaa laabh 60 saal ke hone par milegaa
 For this, from 42 rupees to 1452 rupees have to be paid every month for sixty years
 is aadhaar par pension kii raashi ek hazaar se paanch hazaar tak tay ho sakegi
 For this, you will have to save in the account and if you do not fill it, the government will fill it
 lekin sarkaar 31 disambar tak hi vishesh madad karegi
 The criticism is that this scheme is only for people between 18 and 50 years old
 50 saal se paar ke logon ko kyon baahar kar diya gaya
 Senior citizens are also not included
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki garibon ke liye jo pension yojana he uske liye sabko ek hazaar rupaya diya ja rahaa he
 The Congress says that the Government of India has packaging the Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Shilpi Swasthya Yojana and National Health Scheme
 rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat shilpkaar, uski patni or do bacchon ko beemaa cover diya gaya tha
 From the day of birth till the age of 80 years were within its scope
 697 or 797 rupee premium sarkaar degi har saal or shilpkaar apni taraf se degaa 100 rupee har saal
 Any medical treatment could be done in any hospital in the country

 garibi rekha se neeche ke logon ke liye ek or yojana ai thi rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana jo chal rahi he
 Our guest Mohan Guruswamy has written that in none of the three schemes launched by the Modi government, the government will not give a single penny on its behalf
 sab janata ko dena hoga or naam sarkaar kaa hoga
 He argues that only those who have bank accounts will get the benefit of these schemes
 120 karod kii aabaadi vaale desh main 15 karod logon ke hi bank khate hai
 Why 110 crore people have been excluded from this scheme
 gurusvaami se ham puuchhenge ki ve kis aadhaar par kehete hai ki atal pension yojana ke tahat vahi paisa aapako saath saal baad milegaa jo aapane jamaa kiya he
 Not only this, the number of people who take insurance will be very less
 zyada tar log batch jaaenge
 In such a situation, the premium amount will go in the pocket of banks
 aapako dekhnaa hoga ki 50 saal yaa 60 saal hone par mrityu dar kya he
 Whatever it is, there should be discussion about such policies to which the future of most people is connected

 Except the Atal Pension Yojana, this is the third public insurance scheme of the Modi government
 jandhan yojana main bhi durghatana main marane yaa sharir ke kisi hisse ke kshatigrast hone par ek lakh rupee kaa beemaa cover he to prakritik maut ke baad 30,000 kaa beemaa he
 Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, only the accounts of the poor or the rich are not clear
 jandhan ke tahat durghatana beemaa he hi to do-do nai beemaa yojana kyon launch kii gai
 None of these schemes will get money for treatment expenses
 pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana main durghatana main maut yaa sharir kaa koi ang bekaar hone par beemaa milegaa
 If one hand, one leg and one eye go into the accident, then one lakh rupees will be found
 donon haath, donon paanv chale jaaen to do lakh kaa beemaa milegaa
 People between 18 and 70 years will get benefit of this scheme
 har saal maatr 12 rupee premium dene honge
 It will have to be renewed every year
 pradhanmantri jivan jyoti yojana main 18 se 50 saal ke logon ko beemaa cover milegaa
 After death due to any reason, the family of the insurance holder will get two lakh rupees
 pratidin ek rupee ke hisaab se saal main 330 rupee kaa premium dena hoga
 But policy will be given only after giving 330 rupees together
 har saal is policy kaa navinikaran karana hoga
 If you have three accounts then you cannot take three insurance
 jaisaa ki maine kaha ki beemaa kii khubsuurati detail main hoti he

 According to the information found in the official website of in / name, the insurance holder also has to keep in mind that life protection insurance will be over as soon as 70 years of age
 agar tab tak mrityu nahin hoti he to aapako koi paisa nahin milegaa
 You can avail the Jeevan Jyoti plan by paying premium till the age of 55 years
 beemaa kii raashi tabhi milegi jab mrityu hogi yaa durghatana ke shikaar honge
 This means that the premium of Rs 330 went waste for 37 years
 isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Just you have to know that this insurance is accident insurance
 aam taur par ham jo jivan beemaa karaate hai hamen turm khatm hone ke baad premium kii raashi se dedh se do guna yaa paanch guna raashi milti he
 The government will get the amount in the new insurance scheme, but not after the accident or death
 isi ke saath ek pension yojana bhi launch hui he
 Atal Pension Yojana 18 se 40 saal kii umr ke yuva hi is beemaa ke paatr honge jiskaa laabh 60 saal ke hone par milegaa
 For this, from 42 rupees to 1452 rupees have to be paid every month for sixty years
 is aadhaar par pension kii raashi ek hazaar se paanch hazaar tak tay ho sakegi
 For this, you will have to save in the account and if you do not fill it, the government will fill it
 lekin sarkaar 31 disambar tak hi vishesh madad karegi
 The criticism is that this scheme is only for people between 18 and 50 years old
 50 saal se paar ke logon ko kyon baahar kar diya gaya
 Senior citizens are also not included
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki garibon ke liye jo pension yojana he uske liye sabko ek hazaar rupaya diya ja rahaa he
 The Congress says that the Government of India has packaging the Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Shilpi Swasthya Yojana and National Health Scheme
 rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat shilpkaar, uski patni or do bacchon ko beemaa cover diya gaya tha
 From the day of birth till the age of 80 years were within its scope
 697 or 797 rupee premium sarkaar degi har saal or shilpkaar apni taraf se degaa 100 rupee har saal
 Any medical treatment could be done in any hospital in the country
 tippaniyan Now it has to be seen what is the status of these schemes
 garibi rekha se neeche ke logon ke liye ek or yojana ai thi rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana jo chal rahi he
 Our guest Mohan Guruswamy has written that in none of the three schemes launched by the Modi government, the government will not give a single penny on its behalf
 sab janata ko dena hoga or naam sarkaar kaa hoga
 He argues that only those who have bank accounts will get the benefit of these schemes
 120 karod kii aabaadi vaale desh main 15 karod logon ke hi bank khate hai
 Why 110 crore people have been excluded from this scheme
 gurusvaami se ham puuchhenge ki ve kis aadhaar par kehete hai ki atal pension yojana ke tahat vahi paisa aapako saath saal baad milegaa jo aapane jamaa kiya he
 Not only this, the number of people who take insurance will be very less
 zyada tar log batch jaaenge
 In such a situation, the premium amount will go in the pocket of banks
 aapako dekhnaa hoga ki 50 saal yaa 60 saal hone par mrityu dar kya he
 Whatever it is, there should be discussion about such policies to which the future of most people is connected
 atal pension yojana chhod den to yah modi sarkaar kii teesri jan beemaa yojana he
 Jan Dhan Yojana also has an insurance cover of one lakh rupees in case of death in accident or any part of the body damaged, then there is an insurance of 30,000 after natural death
 jandhan yojana ke tahat sirf garibon ke khate khule hai yaa amiron ke yah spasht nahin he
 There is accident insurance under Jan Dhan, so why were two new insurance schemes launched
 inamen se kisi bhi yojana se ilaaj ke kharche kaa paisa nahin milegaa
 In the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, insurance will be available in case of accidental death or any body part being damaged
 agar durghatana main ek haath, ek pair ek aankh chali jaae to ek lakh rupee milenge
 If both hands and both legs go, then you will get two lakh insurance
 is yojana kaa laabh 18 se 70 saal ke logon ko milegaa
 Only 12 rupees premium will have to be paid every year
 har saal iskaa navinikaran karana hoga
 Under the Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, people between 18 and 50 years will get insurance cover
 kisi bhi kaaran se mrityu ke baad beemaa dharak ke parivaar ko do lakh rupee milenge
 You will have to pay a premium of Rs 330 per year for one rupee per day
 lekin 330 rupaya ek saath dene par hi policy milegi
 This policy has to be renewed every year
 agar aapke teen khate hai to aap teen beemaa nahin le sakate hai
 As i said, the beauty of insurance lies in the detail

 in / naam kii sarkari website se mili jaankaree ke anusaar beemaa dharak ko yah bhi dhyaan rakhana he ki 70 saal kii umr hote hi jivan suraksha beemaa samaapt ho jaaegi
 If you do not die by then you will not get any money
 55 saal kii umr tak premium dekar jivan jyoti yojana kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 The amount of insurance will be received only when there is a death or an accident
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki 37 saal tak 330 rupee kaa premium bekaar gaya
 There is nothing wrong in this
 bas aapako jaananaa he ki yah beemaa durghatana beemaa he
 Generally, the life insurance that we do, we get one to one and a half to two times or five times the premium amount after the end of the term
 sarkaar kii nai beemaa yojana main raashi milegi par durghatana yaa maut hone ke baad hi varna nahin
 Simultaneously a pension scheme has also been launched
 atal pension yojana
 Only the youth between the age of 18 to 40 years will be eligible for this insurance, whose benefits will be given when they are 60 years old
 iske liye saath saal tak har maheene 42 rupee se lekar 1452 rupee dene honge
 On this basis, the amount of pension will be fixed from one thousand to five thousand
 iske liye aapako khate main bachat kerani hogi or nahin bhar paye to sarkaar bhar degi
 But the government will provide special help only till 31 December
 aalochana yah he ki yah yojana 18 se 50 saal ke logon ke liye hi hai
 Why people from beyond 50 years were excluded
 senior citigen bhi shaamil nahin hai
 The Prime Minister said that a thousand rupees is being given to everyone for the pension scheme for the poor
 congress kahati he ki bharat sarkaar ne aam aadmi beemaa yojana, rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya yojana or rashtriya swasthya yojana kii hi packaging kar di he

 janm ke din se 80 saal kii umr tak iske daayre main the
 The government will pay a premium of 697 and 797 rupees every year and craftsman will give 100 rupees every year on his behalf
 desh ke kisi bhi astpal main koi bhi medical ilaaj karaayaa ja saktaa tha
 The comments ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki in yojanaon kii sthiti kya he
 Another scheme for people below poverty line was National Health Insurance Scheme which is running
 hamaare mehmaan mohan gurusvaami ne likhaa he ki modi sarkaar ne jo teen yojanaayen launch kii hai unamem se kisi main bhi sarkaar apni taraf se ek paisa nahin degi
 Everyone has to give it to the public and the name will go to the government
 unki daleel he ki in yojanaon kaa laabh usee ko milegaa jiske paas bank khaataa he
 In a country with a population of 120 crores, only 150 million people have bank accounts
 110 karod log is skim se baahar kyon kiye gaye hai
 We will ask Guruswami on what basis they say that under Atal Pension Yojana you will get the same money after sixty years that you have deposited
 yahi nahin jitne log beemaa lenge usamen marane waalon kii sankhya bahut kam hogi
 More people will be saved
 aise main premium raashi bainkon kii jeb main chali jaaegi
 You have to see what the death rate is when it is 50 years or 60 years
 jo bhi he aisi nitiyon ke bare main charchaa honi chahie jisase zyaadaatar logon kaa bhavishya judaa he
