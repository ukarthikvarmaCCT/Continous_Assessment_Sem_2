 aaj louh purush sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii 144veen jayanti he
 This time the whole country is celebrating this day as 'unity Day' in honor of Sardar Patel
 sardaar patel kaa zikr jab bhi hota he desh ke pehle pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru (pandit Jawaharlal Nehru) kaa zikr jarur hota he
 The BJP often makes the issue of mutual relations between the two
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) apni chunavi sabhaaon main kehete rahe hai ki agar aazaadee ke baad nehru (nehru) kii jagah patel piem banaae gaye hote to desh kii sthiti aaj kuch or hoti
 How was the relationship between Sardar Patel and Pandit Nehru? If one looks at the two letters written by Patel and Patel to each other, some answers are given to this question
 1947 main nehru aaazaad bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri (prime Minister) bane to sardaar patel ko grih mantri jaisaa ahm ohada mila
 It is necessary to know here how Sardar Patel's entry in Nehru's cabinet took place

 chitthee ko yun to aupchaarik hi bataaya gaya tha lekin vah tatkaaleen raajnneeti kii do badi chhaviyon ke bich ke samvaad or rishton ko bakhubi bayaan karti he
 Nehru wrote to Sardar Patel, "I am writing to invite you to join the cabinet because it is necessary to perform some formalities
 is patr kaa koi mahatv nahin he, kyonki aap to mantrimandal ke sudrudh stambh hai
 "patel also wrote a letter to Nehru in response
 Sardar Patel also used the same medium to reply to a letter sent by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 sardaar patel ne 3 agast 1947 ko nehru ko javaabi chitthee likhi
 Patel wrote in his letter, "many thanks for your letter of August 1
 ek-duusare ke prati hamaara jo anuraag or prem rahaa he tathaa lagbhag 30 varsh kii hamaari jo akhand mitrataa he, use dekhte hue aupchaarikta ke liye koi sthaan nahin rah jaataa
 "patel further wrote in his letter," Hope my services remain under you for the rest of my life

 america videsh mantri hillari clinton ne pakistan ko bharat or afghanistan virdohi aatanki guton ko madad dene se baj aane ko kaha he
 The US Secretary of State has warned Pakistan in clear terms that it will have to take strict action against the terrorists living in it
 hillari clinton ne ye baaten ek televijan kaarykram ke dauraan kahi
 He was accompanied by former US Secretary of State James Baker at the event
 hillari clinton ne kaha, 'hamane pakistan se kaha he ki ab ve din khatm ho gaye hai jab aap apni niti ke tahat afghanistan ko asthir karne ke liye kabhi hakkaani netrvak to kabhi taliban kii madad karte rahe to bharat ke khilaaf lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa sarmathan kiya
 "according to Hillary Clinton," it is as if someone keeps poisonous snakes with them and thinks that they will only bite their neighbors
 'hillari clinton ne kaha ki pakistan ke saath rishte lambey samay se chunauteepurn rahe hai
 According to him, 'pakistan after the withdrawal of Soviet army from Afghanistan promoted jihadist ideology which led to an army of fighters inside and outside Afghanistan
 'hillari clinton ne kahaaye 'ham ek aise desh ke saath rah rahe hai jiske paas dher sari samasyaayein hai, jo ki use or hamen hi nahi auron ko bhi prabhavit kar rahi hai
 Hillary Clinton, however, ruled out the possibility of ending relations with Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'ye hamaare hit me he ki ham is rishte ko behatar dhang se nibhaaen or iske liye hamane pakistan ko bhi kaha he
 First of all, they will have to work more on safe havens of terrorists inside their country

 The area has been snatched away from them and Afghan troops are also doing a good job, but the terrorist is still active
 'amariki videsh mantri ne kaha kii pakistan ko yah samajhaana hoga ki afghanista se hamaare hatane ke baad ek shashakt or surakshit afghanistan hi unke hit me he
 Hillary Clinton said, according to him, 'this can only happen when we are part of the solution

 Questioning the use of funds donated by the public to Team Anna, social activist Swami Agnivesh claimed that the money was deposited in Arvind Kejriwal's trust while the other key members are missing
 photo: anna ke liye sadakon par utre samarthaugnivesh ne isse pehle aarope lagaaya tha ki kejariwal ne janata dwaara anna hajaare ke andolan ke dauraan daan diye gayi 80 lakh rupaye se adhik kii dhanrashi ko apane trust main jamaa karke kosh kaa durupyog kiya
 He said that Anna Hazare's name was not included in the 'public Caj Research Foundation' trust run by Kejriwal
 agnivesh ne aarope lagaaya ki jahaan tak ki saaf chhavi vaale nyaayamurti santosh heggde kaa naam bhi is trust main shaamil nahin he
 Therefore, the key members of the team were not involved in this trust and the old trust which included Kejriwal and his associates
 yah paisa unke naam se jamaa hua
 He said that Hazare is keen to form a new trust and wants to involve new members in it
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejis saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki hajaare ne khud kejariwal se kor cameti baithak main kaha tha ki vah website par daan main mili dhan kii vistrut jaankaree daalen
 Hazare had announced that he had asked his colleagues to conduct a brief audit of the funds and put the details on the website
 agnivesh ne kaha ki hajaare 15 aktubar tak dhan jamaa karne or gananaa puri karke ise website par daalana chaahate the
 He made it clear that his opposition was limited to transparency only
 saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki mainan yah isliye kaha he kyonki agar ve jald se jald aisa karenge, to koi shaq yaa sawaal khadaa nahin hoga
 If he delays, people will question why the details were not given
 agnivesh ne kaha ki main kejariwal par yah aarope nahin laga rahaa hum ki vah jaanboojhkar aisa kar rahe hai or vah paardarshita nahin chaahate hai
 i am also not saying that there has been any fraud and corruption in the accounts
 ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karenunhone kaha ki ‘india against karpshan’ andolan paardarshita ko lekar hi he
 When we are fighting against corruption, then transparency is the major and important part of it and accountability is the second part of it

 dekhen mahak chahal kaa item number 'darling': Water rail in the world has been running since the nineteenth century, India has been running since the twentieth century, and is running in the twenty-first century
 bhayankar sookhaa he or aise main koi ek boond pani pahunchaa de to uskaa shukriya
 Whatever is necessary should be done, but when a work is said to be representative of all work, then that work should also be accounted for
 isliye ki pani kii rail ek aisi tasviir rachati he jo logon kii kalpanaaon main nai he
 Whether you believe it or not, the railway of water does not solve the drought-prone areas at all, but it has become a brand of work being done there
 maharashtra ke kai zilon main bhayankar sookhaa he
 For some reason, when there was a lot of discussion about Latur, the water train went to Latur
 rail pahunchi to sthaneey netaa apana poster lekar pahunch gaye
 There is nothing wrong in this
 channel vaale camere lekar pahunch gaye
 There is nothing wrong in this, but the reporters looking at the water train made their eyes wide as if the water had come from the moon
 jabaki usee latur shahar main tractor se khinche jane vaale tanker aaj bhi pachchis lakh litre se zyaada pani baant rahe hai
 Rail also brought similar water
 iske baad bhi samasya main maamuli sudhaar aayaa he jabaki prachaar aise ho gaya ki logon ko rose pani milane laga he
 We have started seeing the tractor tanker as the villain and the railroad tanker as the hero
 sookhe kii sthiti main koi bhi sarkaar simit maatra main hi pani uplabdh karvaa sakati he
 But this image is also right that everyone is getting water
 pani kii rail latur shahar kii paanch lakh aabaadi ke liye chali he
 Latur has not moved to more than nine hundred villages in the district, where seventeen to eighteen million people live
 latur shahar main hi pani kii rail aane se simit raahat hi pahunchi he
 Local people say that earlier, the tankers of the corporation used to come in eight to ten days
 aaj bhi aath se das din ke antar par aa rahe hai
 The district administration claims that water is getting at a difference of four to five days
 saaf he raahat to pahunchi he lekin samasya waisi kii waisi he
 How much water does Latur city need? Some say 250 million liters a day and some say five crore liters
 zila prashasan kaa maananaa he ki har din ke hisaab se ek karod bees saal litre pani hi he
 Twenty liters of water is given to a man every day
 chaar logon kaa parivaar he to assi litre hi hua
 Whereas for all the tasks a family needs at least five to six hundred liters of water
 nigam ke tanker das din ke baad aakar do sau litre se zyada pani nahin dete, de bhi nahin sakate
 This water is also meant only for drinking and cooking
 latur shahar main rail chalane ke baad bhi tankeron ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 This means that the solution was less publicity
 zaahir he pani kii rail se takalif kam nahin hui he
 It happened that the problem of problems stopped and the talk of rail was started
 rail kaa dikhnaa hi paardarshee hona he
 Water rail has become the brand ambassador of drought relief for the whole of Maharashtra
 latur se zyaada bhayankar sookhaa baaki zilon main bhi padaa he
 Is there no need for water rail? Otherwise, tell us which way Beed, Parbhani and Osmanabad figured out that they did not need water rail
 rajasthan main bhi kai saal se ek pani kii rail chalati he
 i do not know the situation there, but the water rail is not the solution, it is visible
 tabhi to kai saal se chal rahi he
 Drought has not only brought thirst, hunger and unemployment
 sarkaar bataayen ki rojgaar dene ke kya prayaas hue hai? kitne logon ko kaam mila he? shaayad un kaamon kaa koi vizual nahin banataa he

 rajya sarkaar ke daawey ke anusaar bina bataaye pahunch gai
 The government says that we only asked for tankers, we have enough water
 to rajya sarkaar yahi bataa de ki centre se tanker maangane se pehle pani rakhane or uske vitaran ke kya intazaam kiye gaye hai? uske paas pani he to log pyaase kyon hai? pani pahunchaana hi bada baari kaam nahin he? uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh kii sarkarein bataayen ki bundelkhand ke samaadhaan ke liye kya kaam kiye gaye? kahaan safal rahe, kahaan asafal rahe
 Even then, the center should have informed the Jhansi district administration before delivering the tanker
 agar yah aarope sahi he to team india kii bhaavana ke kilaaf he
 The center has a rail, not a party
 aajkal kii bhavukta kii nautanki jod di jaae to yah desh kii rail he ! kendriya mantri uma bharti ne kaha ki bundelkhand ke bijepi saansadon ne pani kii qillat kii baat uthaai thi
 Uma ji should tell that only the BJP mps from UP, Bundelkhand, demanded or the mps from Madhya Pradesh too
 kya latur main pani kii rail vahaan ke saansad kii maang par gai thi? phir maharashtra ke baaki suukhaagrast zilon ke bhaajapa saansadon ne bhi kuch maang rakhi hogi? sookhaa to gujarat or madhya pradesh main bhi he, vahaan kyon nahin chali? madhyapradesh ke ratlam se chalakar train upi ke jhaansi aa jaati he
 Bundelkhand, which is part of Madhya Pradesh, is also dry, why is there no water rail? kendriya mantri umaji yaa rail mantri suresh prabhu ji bataayen ki saansadon ne kab maang kii thi or tanker kab taiyaar hue? kyonki hamane latur vaali pani kii rail ke sambandh main dekha tha ki tankeron kii safai main kitna vakt lag gaya tha
 Is the railway cleaning the washing of such tankers for other places also? The tankers sent to Jhansi station were empty
 is hisaab se mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke anusaar khaali tanker hi bheje gaye ! bijepi ke netaa pataa to kar lete ki khaali tanker he, bina jane ve pani kii rail kehane lage
 Now Jhansi station is filling tankers with its water
 centre kahegaa ki ham baantenge, rajya kahegaa ki nahin baantne denge
 Then there will be a fake match on TV about water, all the drought questions will be pushed back
 sarkaar ko bataane kaa mauka nahin milegaa ki logon ko rojgaar dene ke liye kya kiya ja rahaa he
 The comments agar jhaansi stesan se tanker bhare ja sakate hai to kyon nahin prabhu ji saare suukhaagrast ilaaqon ke steshnon ko aadesh de dete hai ki vahaan se log tanker main pani bhar ke le jaaen, muft main
 But here the water rail is running for less politics for water
 rail or helicopter sankat ke samay vir ras vaale drishy kii rachana karte hai
 Their presence in droughts and floods is said to be such as the scene of the famous song of the film 'ajnabee' - we two lovers left the world
 aapane baadh ke samay dekha hoga ki helicopter se girane vaala saamaan sabko nahin miltaa lekin raahat kaa sabase romantic or pramanik drishy garh ke chalaa jaataa he 
 Paan's rail is a good initiative but not the last
 agar ise sookhe kii samasya ko visthapit karne ke liye chalaaya gaya to galat hoga
 The creation of new new legends does not solve it
 sarkaar-samaaj or eemaandaaree se aage aae or sthaayee samaadhaan ke prayaas kare
 If this is the case, why are there so many villages in Maharashtra for water
 bachche kyon kuen main gir kar mar rahe hai? sookhe kii samasya kaa tamaasha mat banaaiye
 Run a water train, but do not let the rail only keep running
 maharashtra ke kai zilon main bhayankar sookhaa he
 For some reason, when there was a lot of discussion about Latur, the water train went to Latur
 rail pahunchi to sthaneey netaa apana poster lekar pahunch gaye
 There is nothing wrong in this
 channel vaale camere lekar pahunch gaye
 There is nothing wrong in this, but the reporters looking at the water train made their eyes wide as if the water had come from the moon
 jabaki usee latur shahar main tractor se khinche jane vaale tanker aaj bhi pachchis lakh litre se zyaada pani baant rahe hai
 Rail also brought similar water
 iske baad bhi samasya main maamuli sudhaar aayaa he jabaki prachaar aise ho gaya ki logon ko rose pani milane laga he
 We have started seeing the tractor tanker as the villain and the railroad tanker as the hero
 sookhe kii sthiti main koi bhi sarkaar simit maatra main hi pani uplabdh karvaa sakati he
 But this image is also right that everyone is getting water
 pani kii rail latur shahar kii paanch lakh aabaadi ke liye chali he
 Latur has not moved to more than nine hundred villages in the district, where seventeen to eighteen million people live
 latur shahar main hi pani kii rail aane se simit raahat hi pahunchi he
 Local people say that earlier, the tankers of the corporation used to come in eight to ten days
 aaj bhi aath se das din ke antar par aa rahe hai
 The district administration claims that water is getting at a difference of four to five days
 saaf he raahat to pahunchi he lekin samasya waisi kii waisi he
 How much water does Latur city need? Some say 250 million liters a day and some say five crore liters
 zila prashasan kaa maananaa he ki har din ke hisaab se ek karod bees saal litre pani hi he
 Twenty liters of water is given to a man every day
 chaar logon kaa parivaar he to assi litre hi hua
 Whereas for all the tasks a family needs at least five to six hundred liters of water
 nigam ke tanker das din ke baad aakar do sau litre se zyada pani nahin dete, de bhi nahin sakate
 This water is also meant only for drinking and cooking
 latur shahar main rail chalane ke baad bhi tankeron ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 This means that the solution was less publicity
 zaahir he pani kii rail se takalif kam nahin hui he
 It happened that the problem of problems stopped and the talk of rail was started
 rail kaa dikhnaa hi paardarshee hona he
 Water rail has become the brand ambassador of drought relief for the whole of Maharashtra
 latur se zyaada bhayankar sookhaa baaki zilon main bhi padaa he
 Is there no need for water rail? Otherwise, tell us which way Beed, Parbhani and Osmanabad figured out that they did not need water rail

 Run a water train, but do not let the rail only keep running
 latur shahar ko kitna pani chahie? koi kahata he rozaana dhai karod litre to koi kahata he ki paanch karod litre
 The district administration believes that there is only 10 million liters of water per day
 har rose ek aadmi ko bees litre pani diya jaataa he
 If there is a family of four, then only eighty liters were raised
 jabaki saare kaaryon ke liye ek parivaar ko kam se kam paanch se chah sau litre pani chahie
 The corporation's tankers do not come and deliver more than two hundred liters of water after ten days
 yah pani bhi sirf pine or khaanaa banane ke liye hota he
 Even after running the train in Latur city, the prices of tankers are increasing
 iskaa matlab he ki samaadhaan kam prachaar hi zyaada hua
 Apparently, the problem of water rail has not reduced
 isse hua yah ki takalifon kii baat band ho gai or rail kii baat chalane lagi he
 The appearance of the rail has to be transparent
 pani kii rail puure maharashtra ke liye sookhaa raahat kaa brands ambaseder ban gai he
 More severe drought than Latur has also occurred in other districts
 kya vahaan pani kii rail kii zarurat nahin? nahin to bataaiye bid, parabhani or osmanabad ne aisa koun sa tarika nikaala ki unhen pani kii rail kii zarurat nahin padi
 Rajasthan also has a water rail for many years
 vahaan kii paristhiti nahin jaanata lekin pani kii rail samaadhaan nahin he yah to dikh rahaa he
 That's why it has been going on for many years
 sookhaa sirf pyaas lekar nahin aayaa he, bhukh or bekaari bhi laayaa he
 Government should tell what efforts have been made to give employment? How many people have got work? Perhaps those works make no visuals
 aaj kii raajnneeti kaam main yaqiin nahin karti he, sirf us kaam main yaqiin karti he jo dikh sake
 Maharashtra government has announced to reduce the entire interest of one year and half of the next year in place of loan waiver
 teen saal se sookhaa he, kaayade se puraa karz maaf hona chahie
 When farming is closed, work is stopped, where will the loan be repaid? Will he earn double after two years? ab yahi rail uttar pradesh ke jhaansi pahunchi he
 As per the state government's claim, it arrived without informing
 sarkaar kahati he ki hamane sirf tanker maange the, hamaare paas paryaapt pani he
 So tell the state government, what arrangements have been made to keep water and distribute it before asking for a tanker from the center? He has water, so why are people thirsty? Isn't water delivery a huge task? Tell the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh what work was done to solve Bundelkhand? Where he has succeeded, where he has failed
 iske baad bhi centre ko tanker pahunchane se pehle jhaansi zila prashasan ko suchit karnaa chahie tha
 If this allegation is true then it is against the spirit of Team India
 centre kii rail he, kisi party kii nahin he
 If we add the gimmick of today's sentimentality, then it is the rail of the country! Union Minister Uma Bharti said that BJP mps from Bundelkhand had raised the issue of water scarcity
 uma ji bataayen ki sirf upi vaale bundelkhand ke bhaajapa saansadon ne maang kii thi yaa madhya pradesh vaale saansadon ne bhi
 Did the water train in Latur go on the demand of the MP there? Then the BJP mps from the rest of the drought-hit districts of Maharashtra would also have made some demands? Drought is also there in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, why did it not go there? The train moves from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh to Jhansi in UP
 madhyapradesh ke hisse vaale bundelkhand main bhi sookhaa he, vahaan kyon nahin pani kii rail gai he? Tell Union Minister Umaji or Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu ji when mps demanded and when tankers were ready? Because we saw in relation to the water train with Latur, how long it took to clean the tankers
 kya railway anya jagahon ke liye bhi aise tankeron kii dhulaai safai kar rahi he? jhaansi stesan par bheje gaye tanker khaali the
 According to this, according to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, only empty tankers were sent! The BJP leaders would have known that there is an empty tanker, without knowing they started saying water rail
 ab jhaansi stesan apane pani se tankeron ko bhar rahaa he
 The center will say that we will distribute, the state will say that it will not allow it
 phir pani ko lekar tivi par farzi match hoga, sookhe ke saare sawaal peeche dhakel diye jaaenge
 The government will not get a chance to tell what is being done to give employment to the people
 tippaniyan If tankers can be filled from Jhansi station, then why not Prabhu ji orders the stations in all the drought-hit areas to take water from the tanker, free of cost
 lekin yahaan to pani kii rail pani ke liye kam raajnneeti ke liye chal rahi he
 Rail and helicopters compose a scene of harp in times of crisis
 sookhe or baadh main inaki maujuudagi aise bataai jaati he jaise 'ajanabi' film ke mashhoor gane kaa seen ho - ham donon do premi duniya chhod chale
 You must have noticed during the flood that not everyone gets the fall of the helicopter but the most romantic and authentic scene of relief goes to the stronghold
 paan kii rail acchhee pahal he lekin antim nahin
 It would be wrong if it was run to displace the drought problem
 nai nai dantakthaon ke gadhane se samaadhaan nahin hota
 Government-society and honesty should come forward and strive for a permanent solution
 agar aisa he to maharashtra ke gaanvon main pani ke liye maaramaari kyon hai
 Why are children dying in a well? Do not make the spectacle of drought problem
 pani kii rail chalaaiye lekin sirf rail hi chalati rahe aisa bhi mat kijiye

Isn't water delivery a huge task? Tell the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh what work was done to solve Bundelkhand? Where he has succeeded, where he has failed
 iske baad bhi centre ko tanker pahunchane se pehle jhaansi zila prashasan ko suchit karnaa chahie tha
 If this allegation is true then it is against the spirit of Team India
 centre kii rail he, kisi party kii nahin he
 If we add the gimmick of today's sentimentality, then it is the rail of the country! Union Minister Uma Bharti said that BJP mps from Bundelkhand had raised the issue of water scarcity
 uma ji bataayen ki sirf upi vaale bundelkhand ke bhaajapa saansadon ne maang kii thi yaa madhya pradesh vaale saansadon ne bhi
 Did the water train in Latur go on the demand of the MP there? Then the BJP mps from the rest of the drought-hit districts of Maharashtra would also have made some demands? Drought is also there in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, why did it not go there? The train moves from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh to Jhansi in UP
 madhyapradesh ke hisse vaale bundelkhand main bhi sookhaa he, vahaan kyon nahin pani kii rail gai he? Tell Union Minister Umaji or Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu ji when mps demanded and when tankers were ready? Because we saw in relation to the water train with Latur, how long it took to clean the tankers
 kya railway anya jagahon ke liye bhi aise tankeron kii dhulaai safai kar rahi he? jhaansi stesan par bheje gaye tanker khaali the
 According to this, according to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, only empty tankers were sent! The BJP leaders would have known that there is an empty tanker, without knowing they started saying water rail
 ab jhaansi stesan apane pani se tankeron ko bhar rahaa he
 The center will say that we will distribute, the state will say that it will not allow it
 phir pani ko lekar tivi par farzi match hoga, sookhe ke saare sawaal peeche dhakel diye jaaenge
 The government will not get a chance to tell what is being done to give employment to the people
 tippaniyan If tankers can be filled from Jhansi station, then why not Prabhu ji orders the stations in all the drought-hit areas to take water from the tanker, free of cost
 lekin yahaan to pani kii rail pani ke liye kam raajnneeti ke liye chal rahi he
 Rail and helicopters compose a scene of harp in times of crisis
 sookhe or baadh main inaki maujuudagi aise bataai jaati he jaise 'ajanabi' film ke mashhoor gane kaa seen ho - ham donon do premi duniya chhod chale
 You must have noticed during the flood that not everyone gets the fall of the helicopter but the most romantic and authentic scene of relief goes to the stronghold
 paan kii rail acchhee pahal he lekin antim nahin
 It would be wrong if it was run to displace the drought problem
 nai nai dantakthaon ke gadhane se samaadhaan nahin hota
 Government-society and honesty should come forward and strive for a permanent solution
 agar aisa he to maharashtra ke gaanvon main pani ke liye maaramaari kyon hai
 Why are children dying in a well? Do not make the spectacle of drought problem
 pani kii rail chalaaiye lekin sirf rail hi chalati rahe aisa bhi mat kijiye
 Now this rail has reached Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh
 rajya sarkaar ke daawey ke anusaar bina bataaye pahunch gai
 The government says that we only asked for tankers, we have enough water
 to rajya sarkaar yahi bataa de ki centre se tanker maangane se pehle pani rakhane or uske vitaran ke kya intazaam kiye gaye hai? uske paas pani he to log pyaase kyon hai? pani pahunchaana hi bada baari kaam nahin he? uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh kii sarkarein bataayen ki bundelkhand ke samaadhaan ke liye kya kaam kiye gaye? kahaan safal rahe, kahaan asafal rahe
 Even then, the center should have informed the Jhansi district administration before delivering the tanker
 agar yah aarope sahi he to team india kii bhaavana ke kilaaf he
 The center has a rail, not a party
 aajkal kii bhavukta kii nautanki jod di jaae to yah desh kii rail he ! kendriya mantri uma bharti ne kaha ki bundelkhand ke bijepi saansadon ne pani kii qillat kii baat uthaai thi
 Uma ji should tell that only the BJP mps from UP, Bundelkhand, demanded or the mps from Madhya Pradesh too
 kya latur main pani kii rail vahaan ke saansad kii maang par gai thi? phir maharashtra ke baaki suukhaagrast zilon ke bhaajapa saansadon ne bhi kuch maang rakhi hogi? sookhaa to gujarat or madhya pradesh main bhi he, vahaan kyon nahin chali? madhyapradesh ke ratlam se chalakar train upi ke jhaansi aa jaati he
 Bundelkhand, which is part of Madhya Pradesh, is also dry, why is there no water rail? kendriya mantri umaji yaa rail mantri suresh prabhu ji bataayen ki saansadon ne kab maang kii thi or tanker kab taiyaar hue? kyonki hamane latur vaali pani kii rail ke sambandh main dekha tha ki tankeron kii safai main kitna vakt lag gaya tha
 Is the railway cleaning the washing of such tankers for other places also? The tankers sent to Jhansi station were empty
 is hisaab se mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke anusaar khaali tanker hi bheje gaye ! bijepi ke netaa pataa to kar lete ki khaali tanker he, bina jane ve pani kii rail kehane lage
 Now Jhansi station is filling tankers with its water
 centre kahegaa ki ham baantenge, rajya kahegaa ki nahin baantne denge
 Then there will be a fake match on TV about water, all the drought questions will be pushed back
 sarkaar ko bataane kaa mauka nahin milegaa ki logon ko rojgaar dene ke liye kya kiya ja rahaa he
 The comments agar jhaansi stesan se tanker bhare ja sakate hai to kyon nahin prabhu ji saare suukhaagrast ilaaqon ke steshnon ko aadesh de dete hai ki vahaan se log tanker main pani bhar ke le jaaen, muft main
 But here the water rail is running for less politics for water
 rail or helicopter sankat ke samay vir ras vaale drishy kii rachana karte hai
 Their presence in droughts and floods is said to be such as the scene of the famous song of the film 'ajnabee' - we two lovers left the world
 aapane baadh ke samay dekha hoga ki helicopter se girane vaala saamaan sabko nahin miltaa lekin raahat kaa sabase romantic or pramanik drishy garh ke chalaa jaataa he

 During the Second World War, after the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Japanese army held about 3000 civilians in Changi Prison, where there were only 600 prisoners at that time

 After this, prisoners were kept in Changi jail from UK, Australia, Netherlands and other places too

 In such a situation, ticket claimants have started coming to the party's state offices

 At the same time, another claimant who wants a ticket from Betul has also prepared a similar affidavit

 People will not get into this and the Congress will benefit from it

 babari masjid-ram janmabhumi swaamitv ke mukademe ke faisle kaa vakt kareeb aa gaya he
 Disputes continued to arise in the 40-day court proceedings for its conclusive hearing
 bilkul aakhri din supreme court ke ird-gird afvaah fail gai ki sunni vakf board jameen par daawa chhod rahaa he
 Earlier, the board had strongly argued in favor of its claim through counsel
 achaanak is elaan se bhaunhen tan gayi, kyonki yah vakf board adhyaksh ke khilaaf teen exiar ke baad aayaa tha
 Initial reports suggested that the move was taken unilaterally and unconditionally
 ab yah saaf ho gaya he ki yah prastaav supreme court kii niyukt kii gai madhyasthata prakriya ke tahat taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 The proposal had the (official) support of the Hindu Mahasabha, the All India Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Revival Committee and the Nirmohi Akhara besides the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Waqf Board with certain conditions
 koi bhi muslim paksh is pahal kaa hissaa nahin tha
 In fact, there are also unconfirmed reports that the Waqf Board has also been divided about this proposal
 viechpi ke niyantran main kaam kar rahe ram janmabhumi nyaas or bhagwaan ram ke shishu rup 'ramalala' ke pratinidhiyon se bhi salaah nahin lee gai
 Lawyers for other Muslim organizations did not take any time to reject the proposal
 alabatta mandir andolan ke kism-kism ke samarthak ram mandir ke nirmaan ke haq main musalamaanon ke samarthan kaa elaan karte hue nikal pade
 In short, the same story lies at the core of the dispute, located exactly within Ayodhya
 313 acre jameen kaa ek tukdaa he, jise aasaani se aaj bharat main real estate kaa sabase vivaadit tukdaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Hindus consider it the birthplace of Rama
 mana jaataa he ki kareeb 500 saal pehle (1528 main) mughal badshaah babar ke senapati mir baaki ne ram mandir ko todakar masjid banaai thi, jise babari masjid kaha jaataa he
 In December 1949, the idols of Ram and Sita suddenly appeared at this 'birthplace'
 hindu daawa karte hai ki yah ek chamatkaar tha or ise saboot ke taur par pesh karte hai ki yah sachmuch ram kaa janmasthan tha
 But then an FIR was lodged at the police station in Ayodhya, which says that some people who entered unauthorized places installed idols in that mosque

 These lawsuits (and a few others) have been circling the maze of courts during the last 50 years

 However, both sides insisted that it was impossible for them to give up their claims

 Hindus strongly say that they represent Ram Ramla, the infant form of Lord Rama, and they are not authorized to give up the claim on the land
 pakshon ke adig ravaiye ke baavjood supreme court ne is saal shuruyaat main madhyasthata kaa nirdesh diya
 The court bench had then said, "we are considering the possibility of healing
" ''madhyasthata gopneey prakriya he jisamen ek tatasth teesraa paksh sabhi pakshakaron ko ek sarvamaanya samaadhaan par pahunchane main madad karata he
 Such an agreement reached in arbitration on the direction of the court can be implemented as a court order

 Efforts to resolve mediation failed on 29 July
 supreme court main lambit apilon par sunwaayee 6 agast ko shuru hui
 After 25 hearings, the Nirmohi Akhara and the Waqf Board sought permission from the court to resume mediation
 adaalat raji ho gai
 Arguments in the court continued simultaneously
 vakf board kaa prastaav in vaartaon ke baad aayaa
 But this raises some very troubling questions
 adaalat ke saamne hindu or muslim pakshon kii numaaindgi darjan bhar se zyada pakshakaar kar rahe the
 There was no 'compromise' possible without agreement between them and the latest round of negotiations was conducted without the consent of all the parties
 yahi nahin, prastaav kaa li hona court ke gopneeyata ke aadesh kaa ulanghan he
 Nothing was achieved by this - a lot of bitterness was born, so different
 anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kya ye kadam muslim paksh ko samjhaute ke haq main jhukne kaa ishaara karne kii garaj se uthaae gaye the
 What next? The Sunni Waqf Board does not represent the entire Muslim community in the Supreme Court and its proposal to give up the claim on the land does not represent the views of the entire community

 The decision to confer an honorary doctorate on Viswanathan Anand sparked controversy on Tuesday when the Union Human Resource Development Ministry questioned his Indian citizenship and finally, the minister Kapil Sibal had to apologize to the chess king
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne hyderabad main anand se telephone par baat kii
 He said that his ministry has not questioned Anand's citizenship and therefore should accept his doctorate
 lekin vishwa champion ne yah kahkar namrata se unka aagrah thukraa diya ki vah apane vyast kaarykram ke kaaran abhi ise hasil nahin kar sakate lekin baad main ise sweekaar karenge
 Anand was to be conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Hyderabad on Monday night with Harvard University Professor David Mumford

 The bureaucrats of the Union Human Resource Development Ministry, however, turned down the Hyderabad University's plan to honor the 39-year-old player

 After reports in the media in this regard, Sibal tried to end the controversy
 unhone hyderabad main anand se phone par baat kii tathaa unki naagarikta ko lekar uthe sawaal par unase maafee maangi
 He attributed the procedural delay in approving Anand's doctorate degree
 is bich anand ne bhi saaf kar diya tha ki jab vah khelte hai to unke bagal main bhartiya tirangaa rahata he or unke paas bhartiya passport he
 The grandmaster told 40 mathematicians before playing chess instruments simultaneously, 'I don't understand this issue

 'anand beat all his rivals in these three-hour games
 iske baad unhone un ganitigyon ke sawaalon ke jawaab diye
 The media, however, was not allowed to ask any questions

 Anand also appeared unperturbed by this entire controversy and did not let any wrinkle on his face

 He said, 'I don't think we are disappointed

 Five years ago, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Smriti Irani of BJP defeated Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Amethi by 1,07,000 votes but Irani, who was firm on motives, did not give up
 unhone is nirvachan kshetra main khunta gaad diya, maheenon lanbaa abhiyaan chalaaya, sthaneey logon ke saath baatcheet kii or soshal ejineering kii ranneeti ko saavdhaanee se anjaam diya, vah bhi tab jab rahul desh or duniya ke dauron main vyast the
 To enter the dalit-muslim alliance of Amethi, Irani chose Suresh Passi, a BJP MLA from Jagdishpur (a constituency in Amethi) and a local Dalit leader
 yahaan tak ki paasi ko yogi adityanath ke mantrimandal main mantri bhi bana diya gaya
 In order to bring Muslim votes into his court, Irani called for Dr
 mohammad muslim ko chunaa jo tiloi (amethi kaa ek or vidhansabha kshetra) se do baar vidhayak rah chuke hai or pehle congress main the
 mohsin-raza, the lone Muslim minister in Adityanath's cabinet, was put in charge of Amethi district

 nateezon ne alabatta un anumaanon ko galat sabit kar diya he
 While the coalition had the silent support of the Congress in many constituencies, the alliance was also openly supported by the Congress in Rae Bareli, which was represented by Sonia Gandhi and in Amethi

 In his five-week long tiring campaign, the Prime Minister held 29 rallies in the state, 18 of which were done in eastern UP, where Priyanka Gandhi took over the Congress fort

 The alliance won 15 seats, while the Congress was reduced to the lone seat of Rae Bareli
 gathbandhan kii 15 siton main se basapa ne 10 or sapa ne paanch siten jeetin
 The BSP, which failed to send a single MP to the Lok Sabha in 2014, benefited from the transfer of sp's Yadav votes, especially in those seats where minority votes are in large numbers (more than 30 per cent), such as Amroha, Ghazipur, Saharanpur

 On the second day of the Test match, India had lost the wickets of openers Murali Vijay and Virender Sehwag on the score of just 12 in the first innings, and Cheteshwar Pujara, also called Team India's 'new Wall' on a total score of 105, also got a personal score of 44

 He showed the way to the boundary, and then with another four on the last ball of the same over, told that the game of Genius is not over

 gendbaajon ne acchhee bhoomika nibhaai, lekin carabian team kareebi antar se jeet darj karne main safal rahi
 India also missed captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during fielding, who was troubled by cramps during batting
 abhi yah saaf nahin ho paaya ki dhoni keval pani kii kami ke shikaar the yaa unki mansapeshiyon main khinchaav aa gaya he
 If he is suffering from a hamstring strain, he will not get enough time to get fit until Tuesday
 yahaan kii pich par ran bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 The comments rohit sharma ne haalanki sanyam bhari pari kheli or ardhashatak jamaaya
 Rohit, who is playing the role of the opener from the Champions Trophy, looks like he is enjoying playing at this position and would like to perform well against Sri Lanka too, but in the opening match of the tournament, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Dinesh Karthik struggled to score runs
 in teenon ko paristhitiyon se jald se jald saamanjasy bithaana hoga
 Suresh Raina, however, tried to keep pace with the conditions and scored 44 runs

 It will not be easy for his players to overcome this drastic defeat

 He hopes that this Federal Front will come to power after the next parliamentary election
 siarpief hameshaa yuddhrat rahati he
 Sometimes with Maoism or terrorism
 saadhaaran gharon se aae iske jabanz javaanon ne kabhi peeche kadam nahin khinchaa
 This is a great force
 inkaa kaam puraa sainik kaa he
 Still we call it paramilitary
 sarkari shreniyon kii apni vyavastha hoti he
 But we never wonder what a half soldier is
 sainik hota he yaa sainik nahin hota he
 Armed soldiers? In 2010, Maoists ambushed and killed 76 CRPF personnel
 phir ye ardh sainik bal purna sainik kii tarah morchon par jaataa rahaa he
 The heart is sad that 40 soldiers have died
 pariwaron par bijli giri he
 The thought of what must have been going on them makes us shudder
 shok kii is ghadi main ham unke bare main sochen
 It is important to understand the language of the attack that is taking place in social media and dock media
 uski lalkaar main uski kuntha he
 The soldiers and the country are not worried
 vah is vakt gam main duube nagarikon ke gusse ko hawa de rahaa he
 Is using godi media hameshaa hi unmaad kii avasthaa main rahaa he
 The martyrdom of the soldiers is doing dock as another occasion of media hysteria
 uski lalkaar ke nishane par kuch kaalpanik log hai
 No one has said anything, yet intellectuals and some journalists are being pointed out
 kya is ghatana main unka haath he? zaraa bataaen ye godi media ki kal ke hamale main ye kaalpanik log kaise jimmedaar hai, jinhen kabhi libral kaha ja rahaa he to kabhi azaadi gang kaha ja rahaa he
 Was the Army and paramilitary forces having problems writing their problems in deciding? And that's why the incident happened? Yesterday, even after the news of this incident came, Manoj Tiwari was dancing in a program at 9 pm
 amit shah karnataka main sabha kar rahe the
 They have tweets
 kya ye godi media amit shah se puch saktaa he ki kyon kaarykram radd nahi kiya? kya unase puch saktaa he ki kashmir main aapaki kya niti he, kyon aatankwaad pair pasaar rahaa he?jinaki zimmedaari he unki koi zimmedaari nahin? kahin aisa to nahin ki in aakaaon ko bachaane ke liye godi media kaalpanik khalanaayak khadey kar rahaa he jise soshal media main hawa di ja rahi he
 On this sad occasion we are being divided among the people of the country
 rajyapal satyapal malik to kai baar kah chuke hai ki dilli ke media ne kashmir ko khalanaayak banaakar maahaul bigaada he
 On the pretext of martyrdom, the dock media is diverting itself and your attention from the basics
 usamen himmat nahin ki sawaal kar sake
 In prime time yesterday, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satyapal Malik stated clearly that there has been a huge lapse
 kafila guzar rahaa tha or koi intazaam nahin tha
 Is it normal? Governor Malik said that not only that it was wrong to walk a convoy of two and a half thousand soldiers
 kafila chota hona chahie taaki uske guzarane kii raftaar tej rahe
 The governor even said that there is a standard procedure of security arrangements before the convoy passes, it was not followed
 aap godi media kii deshbhakti ko lekar kisi bhram main na rahen
 This media falls asleep when farmers come to Delhi
 jaanate hue ki inhen kisaanon ke bete seemaa par shahid hote hai
 Middle class children who create anger and create political atmosphere on social media are not young
 13 disambar ko ardh sainik balon ke hazaron purv jawan apni maangon ko lekar dilli aae
 These demands were necessary to improve their future and boost morale in the present
 sevarat jawan mujhe lagaataar messej kar rahe the ki hamaari baton ko uthaaiye
 We raised it too and they know it well
 tab to kisi ne nahin kaha ki vaah aap inke liye lagaataar ladate rahete hai, inhen sab kuch milanaa chahie kyonki yah desh ke liye jaan dete hai
 Ask yourself, did anyone worry about the December 13 performance? You should ask the leaders of the organization of the former paramilitary forces that what happened on TV on the night of 13 December? If it could not work that day, was it for another day? Recently, the officers of the paramilitary forces lost a battle
 ve apane bal main pasinaa bahaate hai
 Lives but cannot lead his force
 yah kahaan kaa nyaay hua? kya is chook ke liye koi ipies javabdehi legaa? kyon in ardh sainik balon kaa netritv kisi ipies ko karnaa chahie? ardh sainik balon ke jawan or afasar jaan de sakate hai, apana netritv nahin kar sakate? kya aapane in sawaalon ko lekar ardh sainik balon ke liye kisi ko ladate dekha he?ham or aap to shahid kehete hai lekin sarkaar se puuchhie ki inhen shahid kyon nahin kahati he? purna sainik kii tarah ladakar bhi ye ardh sainik hai or jaan dekar bhi ye shahid nahin hai
 On 11 July 2018, the government gave an affidavit in the Delhi High Court that paramilitary forces have not been given martyr status
 aap channel khol kar dekh len ki koun ankar inke haq kii baat kar rahaa he
 They do not even have a pension
 shahadat ke baad patni or uskaa parivaar kaise chalegaa? is par baat hogi ki nahin hogi?purv ardh sainik balon ke sanghathan ke netaa ranvir singh ne kaha he ki gujarat main ardh sainik balon ke shaheedon ke parivaar waalon ko 4 lakh kyon miltaa he? kyon dilli main ek karod, haryana kii sarkaar 50 lakh detii he? ranvir singh ne kaha sahaayta raashi ke liye ek notification honi chahie
 Why should there be discrimination within states about ex-gratia? Why should someone give less and someone should give more than anyone? Ranbir Singh said that GST on ticket was reduced when cinema came, applause in Parliament and paramilitary forces have been demanding since jiesti ke kaaran canteen kii daren bazaar ke baraabar ho gai hai, use kam kiya jaae
 Till date the government has not accepted
 ardh sainik bal isi 3 march ko jantar-mantar phir aa rahe hai
 That day you will see how much the dock media talks about their rights
 privet astpal main kaam karne vaale ek heart sarjan ne mujhe likhaa ki hamalaa hona chahie
 We will pay eighty percent tax

 If the same is reduced and if it is not, then resign for the sake of the country
 kya de sakate hai?is hamale se pehle bajet main agar sarkaar ne vaaki 80 percent tex laga diya hota to sabase pehle yahi doctor sahab sarkaar kii ninda kar rahe hote
 i am not even angry with the doctor
 aisi kamazori ham sabhi main hai
 We all think in this way
 hamen sikhaaya gaya he ki aise hi sochen
 Everyone wants to join the collective
 kuch aisa ho ki samuhikta main bane rahen
 But why can't it be based on logic and fact
 kyon hameshaa unmaad or gusse vaali samuhikta hi honi chahie? main samajhataa hum ki doctor yaa aisi soch vaale kisi ke paas kai tarah kii kunthaayen hoti hai
 They are broken by many unethical compromises
 khud se nazar nahin mila pate honge
 All such people also wait for this time
 ve is samuhikta ke bahaane khud ko mukt karnaa chaahate hai
 In a way, this feeling inside them is a possibility for me
 iskaa matlab he ki ve antaratma kii awaz sun rahe hai
 Just don't turn that sound into noise
 khud ko badalen
 The country will be better by their change
 javaanon ke mata pita ko eemaandaar doctor or ejeeniyar milegaa
 There should be no compromise on security at all
 koi dussahas kare to bejhijak jawaab diya janaa chahie
 We are not toys for someone to play
 magar main yahi bataa rahaa hum ki godi media aapako khilonaa samajhane laga he
 Do not let him play
 note- main ek jawan se baat kar rahaa hum
 The martyr's family is contacting him in the Pulwama attack
 unke bachche is jawan ko apana chachaa kehete hai
 You understand the human difficulties of this brave young man
 vah khub ro rahaa he ki apane senior ke bacchon ko yah chachaa kya jawaab de
 Be a little human
 kab tak aap unmaad ke bahaane bheed kaa sahaara lete rahenge

 " In the current era, where unlimited calls are available for less than Rs 500

 By the way, if the servants of the general public get 10 thousand rupees a month and 1 lakh 20 thousand rupees in the name of telephone allowance, then the question arises
 ji haa,jharkhandamen vidhayakon kii selary main ijapha hone ja rahaa he
 There has also been talk of increasing the mentality allowance
 vah bhi lagbhag 300 pratishat kii badhotaree ho rahi he
 Let me tell you that in Jharkhand, the salary and allowance of the honorable people has been increased for the second time in the present Raghuvar Das government
 iske tahat ab vidhayakon ko har maheene das hajaar rupee telephone bhatte ke taur par die jaayenge
 Now the question arises that when telecom plans are becoming cheaper, then what is the point of paying Rs
 10,000 per month to the mlas
 bill bhi nahin dena hogapako bataa den ki pehle bhi vidhayakon kaa telephone bhatta 40 hajaar salanaa ke kareeb tha

 ab is praavdhaan ko bhi khatm kar diya gaya he
 Now they do not need to submit any bill for their telephone allowance
 ab unki selary main hi prati maheene 10 hajaar rupee jud kar aaenge

 beasenel main bhi kai plan hai jo kaaphi kam paise main analimited colls kii suvidha dete hai
 In such a situation, the cost of the year is about Rs 6 thousand to Rs 10 thousand

 unhone apni garibi or aage badhane ko us tarah se bechney kii koshish kabhi nahin kii, jis tarah se hamaare pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar rahe ek netaa ne kii thi
 He did not stop here, even after becoming the Prime Minister, standing on the wall of poverty, he is busy making the image tower global
 iske ulat kalam ne bas apane man ke kaam kiye
 He became a Bharat Ratna before becoming President
 saare sammaanon se upar or raajnneeti se bhi
 We love the people on the rut
 ham adhik se adhik 'haa' kehane waalon ko saport karne ke liye vikhyath desh hai
 Therefore, he was not given a second 'term'
 unki jagah vishwasaneeyata or ‘apane’ ko tarjeeh di gai
 The politicians who are reading his verses today are the same, who strongly opposed the second term of the President of Genius and the people on partisan grounds
 ham aise logon ko system or shakti dene ke khilaaf rahete hai, jo kuch nayaa karnaa chaahate hai, jo dalgat raajnneeti se pare hote hai, jo navachaar or avishkaar ke sapanom ke saath udate hai
 We love those who follow the rut
 ham to bas adhik se adhik 'haa' kehane waalon ko saport karne ke liye vikhyath desh hai
 So when Kalam agreed to become President, there was a danger that consummate politicians might implicate him in his Chakravyuh
 lekin, kalam yahaan bhi kamaal ke nikle
 He did not come to the Rashtrapati Bhavan as Giani Zail Singh did, as did Pratibha Patil
 vah na to budhapa kaatane aae the or na hi parivaarwaad ko sanvaarane
 The comments kalam hamaari raajnneeti kii ek sukhad bhul the
 He was created for other reasons, but he remained just as President of children and science
 shaayad isliye duusari baar unke naam par vichaar nahin karke hamane pehali baar kisi mahila ko raashtrapati banane kaa avasar diya, kyonki hamen mahila shashaktikaran ke poster ginis book ko bhejne the
 We are adept at paying tribute and mastering the original lesson in the grave
 kalam ham tumhaari baton ko manusan satr main hi barish main baha denge
 Simply, the danger is from the children in whom you are filled with the urge to move forward and question, it is a difficult task to eradicate it

 Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya have become mlcs
 aise main yogi kii gorakhpur or keshav maury kii phulpur loksabhaa seat khaali ho gai he, jahaan ab upachunaav hona he
 While the challenge is for the BJP to win these seats, the challenge of the opposition is to regain their lost political ground through a by-election
 nehru kii viraasatilahabaad jile kiphulpur loksabhaasit congress kii viraasat vaali seat maani jaati he
 Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister represented the Phulpur Lok Sabha seat
 unhone phulpur loksabhaa seat se 1952, 1957 or 1962 main jeet hasil or sansad pahunche
 Politics has changed such a situation that the parliamentary election of Phulpur has been decided through the caste equation for the last several decades

 Keshav Prasad Maurya became MP from Phulpur seat in 2014 as BJP candidate, but had to resign from Phulpur after becoming deputy CM of UP in March 2017
 aise main phulpur seat par ab upachunaav he
 BJP got more than SP-BSP, in view of the votes polled in Lok Sabha elections 2014, Keshav Maurya of BJP 5,03,564 SP 1,95,256 BSP 1,63,710 and Congress 58,127 out of total 9,60,341 votes
 Got votes
 aise main teenon partiyon ke maton ko mila bhi den to bijepi ke baraabar nahin hota
 Phulpur by-election is a challenge to win the Phulpur parliamentary seat for the election of the ruling BJP and the opposition parties
 upachunaav ke jariye 2019 kaa maahaul banane kaa kaam karegi
 That is why BJP does not want to give up any core work, they have also started searching for a strong candidate

 If two Yogi ministers want tickets for their wife, then there are two ministers of the Yogi government, who are contesting tickets for their wife from Phulpur seat

 The second minister is Nandagopal Nandi, whose wife is the Mayor of Allahabad

 This is the reason that from 1996 to 2004, the Samajwadi Party candidate has been winning continuously

 This was a major setback for the Kurmis in the crisis-ridden fraternity and now they are beginning to realize that their domination in Phulpur parliamentary constituency is ending
 apane khoye hue varchasv ko punah praapt karne ke liye is baar kurmi puri takat ke saath ekajute hone ke jugat main hai
 It is not easy to maintain victory, bjp's wave in UP does not look like 2014 Lok Sabha or 2017 Assembly elections
 aise main bijepi ko gherne ke liye ye bhi kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki espi or bispi ek ho sakate hai, lekin abhi tak is tarah kuch hota najar nahin aa rahaa he
 The bjp's atmosphere during the Assembly elections has changed a lot
 yogi ke 6 maheene ke kaarykaal ko dekha jaae to unke paas ginane ko kuch khaas uplabdhiyaan bhi nahin hai
 In such a situation, the big question is how the BJP will be able to retain Phulpur

 Differences between gehlot-pilot Earlier, it was being said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi gave the responsibility of Rajasthan in-charge General Secretary Avinash Pandey to resolve the differences between the pilot Pilot and Ashok Gehlot
 uske baad shanti dhariwal sachin payalat se mili the
 But the way the press release was issued just before the election today, it is clear that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is not ready to bow down
 dhariwal ne kaha he ki sarkaar ke paas adhikaar he or yah niyam bana sakati he ki agar koi yogya vyakti chunaav nahin jeeta he to bhi baahar se kisi ko meyar yaa sabhapati banaaya ja saktaa he, yah raajnneetik dalon kaa adhikaar bhi he
 Dhariwal has said in the press release that if a person of the reserved category does not win from that party and the post of mayor is for the reserved person, then we have a new chairman from outside to stop the horse-trading from other parties
 Measures to be taken were taken
 dhariwal ne kaha ki sabhapati or meyar banane ke liye parshad banane kii koi sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 Significantly, the Kischin Pilot attacked his government on this issue, saying that this would kill democracy and the elected people would become the Mayor and Chairman from the back door entry on the basis of money
 payalat ne is par punarvichaar ke liye kaha tha
 There has been no rethinking on this from the government, but the Urban Development Minister has tried to make it clear that even if we are not withdrawing our rule, we will appoint the chairman from the elected people

 unhone kaha ki akhilesh kii sarkaar main gaiyr yadav or pichhadon ke saath ninsaphi hui, isliye unhone vot nahin kiya
 Apart from this, the SP opposed the reservation in the promotion, so the Dalits and the backward did not vote for it
 unhone kaha ki basapa ke pradesh adhyaksh ares kushvaha ko salimpur seat par samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak dal ke netaa ram govind choudhary ne haraaya
 He got the sp's vote transferred to the BJP, but Akhilesh did not take any action against him

 Today is the birth anniversary of Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar
 unki jayanti (ramdhari Singh Dinkar Jayanti) ke maukey par puraa desh unhen yaad kar rahaa he
 Dinkar was a poet who, despite being close to power, stayed in the hearts of the people
 desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai se lekar aazaadee milane tak ke safar ko dinakar (dinkar) ne apni kavitaaon dwaara vyakt kiya he
 Not only this, Dinkar has brought the victory of the country to defeat and every difficult situation in his poems
 ek ore unki kavitaao main oj, vidroh, aakrosh or kranti kii pukaar he to duusari ore komal shringaarik bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti he
 The magic of Dinkar's poems remains the same today
 dinakar kisi ek vichaardhaara kaa samarthan nahin karte the
 In his early poems, Dinkar (ramdhari Singh Dinkar), who raised the tide of feelings of nationalism and patriotism among the youth, further emphasizes the development of the spirit of internationalism by immersing nationalism
 satta ke kareeb hone ke baavjood bhi dinakar kabhi janata se dur nahin hue
 His popularity among the public has always remained
 dinakar par harivansh raay bachchan kaa kahana tha, ‘dinakar ji ko ek nahin balki gadhy, padya, bhashaa or hindi ke seva ke liye alag-alag chaar gyanpith milane chahie the'unki pehali rachana 'renuka' 1935 se prakashit hui
 Three years later, when his work 'hunkar' was published, the youth of the country liked his poems very much
 1952 main jab bharat kii pratham sansad kaa nirmaan hua, to unhen rajyasabha kaa sadsy chunaa gaya or vah dilli aa gaye
 Dinkar was awarded with many big awards like Sahitya Academy Award, Jnanpith Award, Padmavibhushan
 unhen padam vibhushan kii oopaadhi se bhi alankrita kiya gaya tha
 Dinkar's famous book 'four Chapters of Culture' has been written by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 is prastaavna main nehru ne dinakar ko apana ‘saathi' or ‘mitra' bataaya he

 sadiyon kii thandi-buji raakh sugabuga uthi,mitti sone kaa taj pahan ithlaati he;do raah, samay ke rath kaa gharghar-naad suno,singhaasana khaali karo ki janata aati he
 public ? Yes, the idols of clay are the same, enduring the tightness of winter and frost, even when the snakes are being sucked from side to side
 janata ? haan, lambi-bady jeebh kii vahi kasam,"janata,sachmuch hi, bady vednaa sahati he
 "" Well then, but, what is public opinion on this? "" What is the question that the dumb public says on this? " maano,janata hi phool jise ahsaas nahin,jab chaaho tabhi utaar sajaa lo donon main;athwa koi doodhmunhi jise bahalane kejantar-mantar simit hon chaar khilaunon main
 But there is a stir, whirlwinds arise, when the people are angry, they climb up Bhrkuti; listen to the path of time, the chariot of time, empty the throne that the public comes
 hunkaaron se mehalon kii neenv ukhd jaati,sanson ke bal se taj hawa main udata he,janata kii roke raah, samay main taav kahan ?vah jidhar chaahati, kaal udhar hi mudata he
 The darkness of the Abdos, centuries, millennia; The window is shaken by amber; it is no one else, the dreams of the public go up and down the thigh of the unseen
 sab se viraat janatantr jagat kaa aa pahunchaa,taintis koti-hit singhaasana tay karmbhishek aaj raja kaa nahin, praja kaa he,taintis koti janata ke sir par mukut dharo
 Whom do you seek for aarti in idiots, temples, royalty, in the cellars? Gods are breaking ballast on the streets, gods will be found in the fields, barns
 fawde or hal rajdand banane ko hai,dhoosarataa sone se shringaar sajaati he;do raah, samay ke rath kaa gharghar-naad suno,singhaasana khaali karo ki janata aati he

 haar kar baitha chaand ek din, mata se yah bolaa,‘‘silava do maan mujhe oon kaa motaa ek jhingola
 Sunsan, the moving air overnight, i die of winter, i complete the journey in some way by chilling
 aasmaan kaa safar or yah mausam he jaade kaa,na ho agar to laa do kurta hi koi bhaade kaa
 '' bachche kii sun baat kaha mata ne, ‘‘are salone!kushal karen bhagwaan, lagen mat tujko jaadu-tone
 Winter is fine, but i am afraid, i never see you in one size
 kabhi ek angul bhar chaudaa, kabhi ek foot motaa,bada kisi din ho jaataa he, or kisi din chota
 Every day it does this, it is visible or not; no one's eyes are visible
 ab tu hi ye bataa, naap tera kis rose livaayen,si den ek jhingola jo har roj badan main aae?''3
 Then Karna, as the 'sadhu-sadhu' got up, gross male and female, rajvansh ke netaaon par padi vipad ati baari
 Drona, Bhishma, Arjun, all faded, all getting sad, ek suyodhan badha, bolte hue, 'vir! shaabaash!' He again challenged Parth for a fight, arjuna ko chup hi rahane kaa guru ne kiya ishaara
 Kripacharya said- 'listen, o young man unknown,' Arjuna is the child of bharat-dynasty-avatans Pandu
 'kshatriya he, yah raajputr he, yon hi nahin ladega,jis-tis se hathapayee main kaise kud padegaa? If you want to fight with Arjun, do not go silent in the meeting, say something in the name, tell me who are you? ' 'jati! hai ri jati!' karn kaa hriday kshobh se dola,kupit surya kii ore dekh vah vir krodh se bolaa 'caste and caste, whose capital is only heresy, what shall i know? These are my arms
 'upar sir par kanak-chhatra, bheetar kaale-ke-kaale,sharamaate hai nahin jagat main jati poochnevaale
 i am a sutraputra, but who was the father of Parth? Say courage, do not remain silent in silence
 'mastak unchaa kiye, jati kaa naam liye chalate ho,par, adharmamay shoshan ke bal se sukh main palate ho
 Your soul, trembling with the half-castes, asks for the donation of the thumb with deceit
 'bif' ek aisa shabd he, jiske uccharan maatr se maujuuda vakt main raajnneeti or samaaj kii tamaam samvednaaen or uttejnaa tantra sakriy ho jate hai, lekin yah durbhaagya hi he ki desh kii ek mananeey adaalat ke paas is ore jaanch ke liye lab nahin he
 The helpless law can be nothing more than an agony of the law, whether a piece of meat is beef or not, it is confirmed by seeing color and reading articles on the internet
 yakeenan yah jitna dilachasp he, usase kahin zyada durbhaagya
 Because the law that seeks justice for the society and the general public, in the absence of law and technology, the Internet is forced to give its verdict
 maamla punjab or haryana hai court kaa he
 Where the court acquits most of the accused in reference to internet in case of not having lab, by referencing the internet
 haryana or punjab membif par banalaga hua he
 The judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court are said to often refer to and refer to the Internet in the decisions of cases under the Punjab Prohibition of Cow Slaughter Act of 1955
 kai baar nichali adaalaton dwaara bif rakhane yaa khaane ke aropiyon ko chhodte samay jaj internet par is silsile main darj jaankariyon kaa sandarbh dete hai
 However, in many cases when cow skin and head are recovered from the accused, cow slaughter is confirmed
 jabaki is ore pakade gaye adhiktar aaropee lab jaanch kii suvidha nahin hone ke kaaran chhot jate hai
 In 2011, Justice Alok Singh, while acquitting the accused in one such case, conducted a search on the Internet 'sorting out the best pieces of beef'
 apane faisle main adaalat ne likhaa, 'bif ke tukdon main kinare ke aasapaas kaa fat safed se iveri yani hathi daant ke rang jaisaa hona chahie
 'in a judgment in April 2015, the High Court acquitted one of the accused, writing,' Only showing a piece of meat to the conclusion that it is beef and it is wrong to sentence on this basis
 ' isi tarah march 2009 main mevaat kii ek court ne isuf ko 25 kilo bif rakhane kaa doshi maanakar sajaa sunai
 Isuf was released by the High Court, saying it was difficult to decide whether the recovered meat was actually beef
 isuf ke maamle main trial court ne sajaa sunaate hue visheshgyon kisalaah kaa havaladia tha, jo jaanwaron ke doctor hote the
 The doctors then said, 'the flesh found by the accused is red, soft and the muscles between its 2 fats are yellow in color
 yah sabit hota he ki yah maance bif hi he
 'on the other hand, the accused said that the fat color found in beef is white or cream color
 hai court ne maamle main lab nahin hone kii sthiti main internet par padhakar yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki bif main paae jane vaale vasa kaa rang kaisaa hota or ant main isi kaa sandarbh lete hue aaropee ko bari kar diya gaya

 gurdas singh tuur kabhi babaram rahim kaa khaas sevakahua karata tha
 He worshiped Baba and worshiped him
 lekin, jaise-jaise baba ke kareeb hota gaya, khud ko unki bhakthi se dur paata gaya
 He saw Baba's cave with his own eyes
 gupha main jaati bebas sadhviyon ko dekha
 Heard stories of his plundered Asmat
 isane baba ko raasalila rachaate dekha
 Meaning it saw every form of Baba
 to aaie ab aap bhi jaan lijie baba ke rahasyalok main maujuud baba kii us gupha kii asaliyat:baba ke pairon kaa pani peetin ladkiyanrojaanaa baba ke dere par baba kii aawaaj main baba kaa gaanaa becoground main baj rahaa hota he
 Baba stands at the water fountain and puts his feet in the water
 unke chaaron taraf unki sadhvi or sevak khadey hote hai
 As Baba steps forward, the Sadhvi breaks down to drink the water under her feet
 baba puri tarah se magan rahete hai
 Baba Ram Rahim has a total of two camps in the cave of Baba's forgiveness
 baba ke ye donon dere sabase bade hai
 However, apart from these, Baba also has a total of 179 ashrams across the country
 inamen se zyaadaatar main baba kii gupha he
 Baba's bedroom if the cave is spoken
 unke aaraam farmaane kii jagah
 These caves are in the basements, and somewhere above the ground
 lekin ram rahim inhen gupha kahana hi pasand karata tha
 That is, in 2001, when a sadhvi opened the cave of Ram Rahim's cave through anonymous letter, Baba started calling his base tera-vas instead of the cave
 five star hotel jaisi guphasirsa ke dere main baba kii gupha kisi five star hotel se kam nahin he
 There is a swimming pool, living room, drawing room, dining room and many other amenities in the cave
 yahaan wo apane sadhviyon kaa yonshoshan karata tha or apane khaas logon se miltaa bhi tha
 The victim girl has mentioned the same rape in the camp in Hisar camp
 gupha ke bahari hisse main jahaan baba ke sadhak commandos ke libaas main choubison ghante tainaat rahete the
 At the same time, there was an intelligence way in the cave to bring sadhus and girls
 yahi nahin ram rahim jab apane deron se dur hota tha, to apane saath chalanevaali bas main hi tent lekar chalata tha, jisase temprari gupha bana letaa tha
 Baba used to do Majlis twice in the morning and evening, resting in a luxurious life
 wo subah chah baje uth kar pehle kasarat kiya karata tha
 Then he used to get ready and give darshan and sermon to his devotees
 iske baad baba apane gupha ke drawing room main alag-alag makasad se aae logon se alag-alag jagahon par miltaa tha
 Then he used to go to rest and in the evening there was a continuation of Majlis and discourse
 isi dauraan wo bhakton or khaaskar biimaar or pareshaan logon ko prasad diya karata tha
 Then in the evening the same sequence of exploitation of the Sadhvis started
 sadhviyon ko rajbaba hameshaa hi sadhviyon se ghira rahata tha, lekin in sadhviyon main kuch ko wo apane behad kareeb rakhata tha
 In Hisar's camp, Dera Sacha Sauda, about four hundred sages were always with Baba
 inamen kareeb do sau sadhviyaan aisi thim, jinhen baba ne sat brahmacharee sadhvi kaa darja de rakhaa tha
 These sages were more educated, young and beautiful, which Baba always kept with him
 yah sadhviyaan choubison ghante baba ke khaane-pine, uthne-baithne, nahaane-dhone kaa intjaam karti thim
 Whereas Baba had given the status of Brahmachari Sadhvi to only two hundred Sadhvis, he lived a short distance from them
 girls skool se shuru hota tha khelhisar ke apane dere par baba ne apane bhakton kii ladakiyon ke liye girls skool bhi khol rakhaa he, jo baba kii rahanevaali jagah yani ashram kii gupha ke bilkul qareeb he
 People who have been devoted to Baba tell that Baba actually started the exploitation of girls from this girls' school
 sadhviyaan skool ke dinon se hi ladakiyon kaa brain wash kar unhen baba ke kareeb laane or parosane ke jugad main lag jaati thim or to or har saal pandrah agast ko apane janmdin par baba isi skool main apane sadhviyon or chaatraon ke saath aisa dance karata tha, jinhen dekhne kii ijaajat ladakiyon ke gharavaalon ko bhi nahin thi
 Lord Krishna used to give reference to Baba for sexual exploitation of his sages
 wo kahata tha ki jab bhagwaan krishna apni gopiyon ke saath raas rachaa sakate hai, to wo kyon nahin? baba ke is bol vachan kaa zikr naa sirf khud us peedit ladki ne apni shikaayat main thi balki khud baba ke sadhak rah chuke log bhi karte hai
 Expensive clothes, luxurious cars, Choparbaba was fond of expensive and luxurious clothes, it can be easily understood by looking in any of his pictures
 gadiyon ke liye baba kaa lagaav sabase alag tha
 This is the reason why Ram Rahim's fleet has such a huge fleet of expensive and luxurious vehicles including Mercedes, BMW, Bentley, Ferrari, Range Rover, Land Cruiser, which no one can think of
 ram rahim ne hisar ke apane ashram main car dizin kii unit tak laga rakhi he
 Baba also has his own helicopters for personal use
 ye bhi padhie
 
 
 The unheard story of that abla, which Ram Rahim had raped, for five reasons, people like Ram Rahim and Rampal became 'lord' Balatkari Baba
 
 
 ram rahim hi nahin in par bhi laga yon shoshan kaa aropalauf ke wo 3 ghante
 
 tabadatod chalin goliyaan or girte rahe deraa samarthak!ram rahim: rape or murder hi nahin napunsak banane kaa bhi laga aaropgel main ram rahim kaa deraa

 Now here the question arises that why the book is banned? What is the law to ban books in India? Is it a crime to keep a book with you? On this, the Supreme Court Bar Association Vice President and Senior Advocate Jitendra Mohan Sharma said that the books can be banned on books that threaten national unity and integrity or hurt one's religious sentiments

 ’ With Mamata Banerjee (didi) withdrawing support from the Center for United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government against the Centre's economic policies, foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail trade and increase in diesel prices, all eyes are now on Behenji (mayawati) ) And the political stance of Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav)

 All eyes are now on Mayawati, president of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Mulayam, president of Samajwadi Party (SP)
 raajnneeti ke dhurandhar khilaadi maane jane vaale ye donon netaa ab loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue apana napha-nuksaan taulne main jute gaye hai
 According to political experts, now pressure has also increased on Mayawati and Mulayam
 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar ye donon netaa centre sarkaar ke saath zyada din tak khadey nahin ho sakate kyonki unhen janata ko bhi jawaab dena padegaa
 Senior journalist Abhayanand Shukla says that after Mamta's decision, now the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has become dependent on the 'M factor' of the state but there is little hope of the government falling because the government can accept Mamata's demands to some extent
 basapa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki bahanji ke jald hi party ke sansadeey dal kii baithak bulaane kii sambhaavna kam hi he

 Rashid Khan, another political analyst, says that after Mamata's announcement, not only Mulayam has also put pressure on Mayawati that she is really angry with the Center's policies on FDI and inflation, or whether she is opposed only to ritualism
 rajyasabha ke ek varisht sapa saansad kaa kahana he ki sapa ko bhi ab centre sarkaar se samarthan waapas le lenaa chahie nahin to janata ke bich janaa mushkil ho jayega
 This leader doubted Mulayam's decision to take a decision in this regard
 sapa ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne bhi apane ek bayaan main kaha ki sapa philhal 20 sitambar ko hone vaale band par apana dhyaan kendrit kiye hue he
 Any decision will be taken by the central leadership of the party
 is bich bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) bhi mayawati or mulaayam par is baat ke liye dabaav badha rahe hai ki ve doharaa charitra dikhaanaa band karen or tatkaal centre se apana samarthan waapas len
 BJP state spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that SP and BSP should clarify their stand as both opposition and support cannot run simultaneously among the public
 pathak ne kaha ki epadiai or mahangaai ko lekar sapa or basapa ko bhi mamata kii tarah hi dabaav bananaa chahie or apana rukh spasht karnaa chahie
