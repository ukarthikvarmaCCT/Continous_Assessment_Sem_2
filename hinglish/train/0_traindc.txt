 After Reliance Jio's free 4G internet, calling and free roaming, now get ready for some services which are probably more important than 4G and people will also like it
 mila jula kar reliance 4G desh bhar main thik thaak hi chal rahaa he, lekin speed to kam jarur hui he
 At present, all services are free under the welcome offer, so customers do not have much complaint
 baharhaal company shaayad ab 4G ko thik karne ke bajaae nai sarvice par zyada focus karti hui najar aa rahi he
 These new services claim to offer broadband with the most typical 1gbps speed
 kyonki jahaan logon ko bamushkil1mbps speed milti he vahaan 1gbps yani 1,024mbps speed dene kaa daawa kaaphi gambhir he
 However this is possible and it is so in many countries
 aane vaale dinon main company vird broadband ko lekar bada elaan karegi
 Because its testing has started and many people are also claiming to use internet at 1gbps speed
 agle saal tak company in sarvice kii shuruyaat kar sakati he
 During the launch of Fiber to Home (FTTH) Reliance Jio, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, spoke about the introduction of 'fiber to the Home' (FTTH) early
 iske tahat maximum 1gbps internet speed dene kii baat he
 According to the report, plans of Reliance Jio Fiber will also be as attractive as Jio Mobile
 phone radar kii ek khabar main kaha gaya he ki sabase pehle company fibre tu da home kii testing dilli or mumbai main karegi
 It has been said in this report that this service has been started and for this, a welcome offer of up to 90 days will be offered, just like Jio Mobile
 90 dinon baad 500 rupee se kii shuruaati keemat ke saath yah sarvice shuru ho jaaegi
 Under Reliance Jio Fiber Broadband Service, users will get three types of plans
 inamen silver, gold or platinum shaamil hai
 Although it is not clear from the report how the three plans will work, but it has been said that like other tariffs, it will also be data, speed and price based
 jeeyo tivi ke liye set top boxcjhios ke liye set top box jo router kii tarah hi kaam karegaa
 Through this, 44 devices can be connected simultaneously
 Jio TV sarvice ke jariye 350 channel dekh sakenge jinamein 50 echdi channel honge
 All the TV programs will remain in the set top box for seven days
 iske liye alag se storage kii jarurat nahin hogi, kyonki ye jeeyo ke cloud par seve honge
 Although the information is not completely clear right now, but many things will come out in the coming months
 jeeyo media share apek aisa ap jiske jariye ek divaais se duusare divaais main content ourdeta transfar kar sakenge
 There are many such apps already, but it is being told that in many ways this app will be different from others
 iske jariye ek baar main paanch divaais ko conect kar sakenge jinamein tivi, laptop, desktop yaa computer ho sakate hai
 For example, if you are watching a video in mobile, then you can play it simultaneously in computer and TV at the same time
 jahaan se aapane mobile main film dekhni band kii he vahiin se laptop main shuru bhi kar sakate hai
 Through this, many devices can play real time video

 The smart home will be Internet of Things (iota) based which can be fitted in the home
 iske jariye aap ghar kii security system, moshan sensors, camera, spikar, dorbel, smoke or fire detector ko manage kar sakate hai
 Public wifireliance Jio introduced jabtariff during the official launch, so it has a provision of some GB data separately
 yah public wifai ke jariye yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, testing has started in some parts of Mumbai and will be in other places soon
 yani jahaan jeeyo kaa public wifai hotspot hoga vahaan se jeeyo sim yujar phone conect karke internet chalaa sakate hai
 Data will be deducted from your tariff, ie it is not a free case
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki reliance jeeyo ke darjanon eps hai
 These include film, music, security, and cloud storage, but users believe that these apps stop and stop and reduce the speed
 aise main nayaa ap or nai sarvice kaa rispons time kaisaa hoga kah paanaa mushkil he

 After this, we will all sit together again and the party with the maximum seats can claim the post of PM
 bataa den ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajute hone kii koshish main juta he, lekin abhi tak gathbandhan kaa swaroop tay nahin ho sakaa he
 Not only this, the picture has not been cleared on the candidature for the post of PM
 upie ke sahyogi dalon ke dwaara die ja rahe is formule ke lihaaj se dekha jaae ko vipaksh kii ore se sabase zyada siten congress ke khate main ja sakati hai
 The Congress currently holds the maximum seats in the party that forms part of the grand alliance 
 itnaa hi nahin, baaki dalon kii tulana main bhi congress kaa aadhaar zyada he
 The basis of regional parties is limited to their respective states
 bihar kii hi baat kii jaae to vahaan loksabhaa kii kul 40 siten hai
 In such a situation, RJD will not be able to become the largest party even after performing its best performance here
 vahiin, aise hi sameekaran trinmul congress ke saamne bhi hai
 In the case of Mayawati in UP, in the event of an alliance, her party will not be able to contest more than half of the 80 seats
 aise main wo bhi kya piem pad kii daavedaari laayak siten jeet paaengi, is par bhi sawaal he
 On the other hand, being a national party, the Congress is in a strong position in many states
 yahaan tak ki 2014 main usne sabase kharaab pradarshan main bhi 44 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 Which has reached 48 by winning the by-elections in the coming 2018
 is lihaaj se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress baaki dalon kii tulana main zyada siton par chunavi maidan main utregi
 The Congress has fixed a target of winning 200 plus seats
 aise main nishchit rup se congress kii sahyogi dalon se zyada siten aaengi
 Congress will be the strongest in terms of this formula
 yahi vajah he ki tejasvi kaa formula kahin na kahin congress rahul gandhi kii ore sanket kar rahaa he

 When Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar is starting his second term, the biggest challenge before him is how to create employment opportunities in the state and encourage entrepreneurship

 Due to Delhi's proximity to the international airport, nearly 300 of Fortune's 500 companies have their India headquarters in Gurugram, creating a conducive environment to encourage entrepreneurship in the region
 lekin iskaa vipareet asar bhi hota he
 Says an industrialist, "this is the reason that the recession in the state has had the greatest impact and will be felt even further
" ''lekin mukhyamantri, jo vyaktigat rup se sthiti par najar rakh rahe hai, ko puraa bharosa he ki unhone apane pehle kaarykaal main jo majboot aadhaar khadaa kiya tha, uske bal par berozegaar hue logon ko nai naukariyaan mil jaaengi

 Raj is one of the few actors in Hindi cinema who managed to make an impact on society
 yah ajeeb sanyog he ki mahaan filmkaar raaj kapur or unke ajij dost or geetkaar shailendra donon ke jivan main 14 disambar kii taarikh kaa ahm role he
 Born in Peshawar on December 14 in 1924, Shailendra breathed his last at the age of 43 in 1966, 42 years later
 1966 main jab shailendra kaa nidhan hua toraj kapur'meraa naam joker' film banane main biji the or unki team unke janmdin par jashn manaane kii taiyaari main juty thi
 Meanwhile, Shailendra suffered mental trauma due to the flop of the third film Kasam and his health deteriorated significantly
 usee din dopaher baad vah aspataal main jivan-maut ke bich sangharsh kar rahe the or unki sthiti ke bare main gayak mukesh lagaataar raaj ko apadet de rahe the
 But after a few hours, Raj got the last call in which he came to know that his strange friend left this world
 shailendra kii barsaat se entricalendra ko film duniya kaa hissaa banane main raaj sabase bada yogadan tha
 This is to say that Raj recognized this unique talent at the age of just 25 and added to his new team
 1949 main ai film barsaat ke saare gane hasarat jaipuri ne likh die the, lekin shailendra kii madad ke liye unhone unase do gane 'barsaat main hamase mili tum' or 'patali qamar he' is film ke liye likhwaaye, jisamen pehla gaanaa tital song he jo behad lokapriy hua
 It also has the status of the first title song of Indian cinema
 shailendra railway main kaam karte the or kavi sammelnon main jaaya karte the
 During this, Raj heard Shailendra's song 'jalata Hai Punjab' in a smile and was very impressed
 unhone filmon ke liye likhane kaa ofer diya
 After not accepting it, Raj refused to buy this song for the film Aag
 vakt guzarane ke saath hi shailendra par aarthik sankat mandaraane laga to vah raaj ke paas gaye or kaam maanga jise unhone barsaat ke liye gane likhane kaa mauka diya
 And then from here the jugalbandi of these two great personalities took such a note that became immortal and when this world will be there, their notes will continue to be played
 raaj or shailendra ne kareeb 21 filmon main ek saath kaam kiya
 This story started with the rain in 1949 Awara (1951), Anhoni, Ah, Boot Police, Shree 420, Stay awake, chori-chori, Now Delhi is not far, i am drunk, Kanhaiya, Anadi, The country in which Ganga flows
 , Aashiq, Ek Dil Sau Afsane, Sangam, Teesri Kasam, Deewana, Around the World, Sapna Ka Saudagar and Mera Naam Joker (1970)
 shailendra kii achaanak hui maut ke kaaran meraa naam joker kaa yah gaanaa 'jeena yahaan maranaa yahaan' adhuraa rah gaya jise puraa kiya tha unke bete style shailendra ne
 In the world of music, singer Mukesh and music composer shankar-jaikishan together with Raj's quartet Raja and Shailendra performed several dances
 is chaukadi ne aawaara hum (aawaara), ramaiya vastavaiya (shri420), meraa juuta he japani (shri 420), kisi kii muskaraahaton pe (anaadi), jeena yahaan maranaa yahaan (meraa naam joker) jaise dheron yaadgaar nagamen dekar na sirf hindi cinema ko sampann banaaya balki bhartiya cinema ko badi saugat saunp gai
 Raj used to fondly call Shailendra as Pushkin or Kaviraj
 sangeet ke kshetra main unke pansadeeda sangeetkaar rahe shankar-jaykishan
 He worked with the pair in 20 films, including 10 under the banner of his own production
 haalanki isamen 2 filmon main shankar ne akele sangeet diya kyonki jaykishan kaa nidhan ho chukaa tha
 Madhubala, the first heroine Kapoor was born in Peshawar in 1924 and following in the footsteps of her father actor Prithvi Raj Kapoor, decided to step into the film world

 But in 1947 he got a big break from Neelkamal and appeared in the lead role with Madhubala
 is tarah se madhubala raaj kii pehali filmi nayika bani
 Apart from Nargis and Madhubala, along with Nutan and Baijantimala, they also appeared on screen
 24 saal kii umr main raaj ne aarake production shuru kiya or us samay film aag (1948) ko nirdeshit kar sabase yuva nirdeshak bane
 The year 1949 was very successful for him
 mehboob khan kii film andaaj main vah dilip kumaar or nargis ke saath jo unke kariyar kii pehali behad kaamyaab film thi
 At the same year, Barsaat, as producer-director, also made a huge success
 unhen 3 rashtriya film puraskaar ke saath-saath 11 filmphere award bhi mili
 The prestigious Time magazine has described Raj's work in Awara as one of the 10 best performances in the world
 unki filmein asia or europe main bhi behad lokapriy raheen
 In Russia, Raj is still a well-known name and the songs of his films are heard
 tatkaaleen soviet rus main bhartiya samskruti kii pahchaan 3 baton se hoti thi jisamen shiv, yoga or raaj kapur shaamil the
 Raj Kapoor starred in 16 films with Jodinargis, who was successful with Nargis
 donon kii ek saath ai pehali film thi aag
 While chori-chori (1956) was the last film with Raj as the heroine
 haalanki iske baad jaagate raho (1956) main chemiyo ke rup main najar ai
 Raj loved working with a team
 unki team main geetkaar ke taur par shailendra or hasarat jaipuri, sangeetkaar ke rup main shankar jaykishan, gayak ke rup main mukesh, manna de or lata mangeshkar, nayika ke taur par nargis or lalita pavaar ahm hissaa hua karte the

 com / kwuffhczzg Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Azam Khan has alleged in a case of detaining himself at a US airport for a brief period that Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid conspired to 'defame' him outside India
 khan ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki bharat lautne par unke or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa paksh sunne ke baad samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav centre kii samprag sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhane ko lekar vichaar karenge
 Before leaving for India, he said, "our leaders know what happened and who is behind it
" vah samprag sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhane par jald vichaar karenge
 In reference to Akhilesh's meeting with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa in Chennai, Khan said that the possibility of forming a third front with AIADMK and Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) cannot be ruled out
 unhone kaha ki aisa morcha banane par mulaayam singh iskaa netritv karenge or vah desh ke agle pradhanmantri banenge
 Azam Khan emphasized that his position in the airport detention cannot be compared with the positions of Kalam, Shah Rukh, Indian envoy to the UN Hardeep Singh Puri and former Ambassador Meera Shankar in Washington
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah ek sajeesh kaa nateeja tha kyonki main bharat kaa ek gaiyr-congressi taqatvar muslim netaa hum or unhone (khurshid) bhartiya cabinet mantri ke apane rutabe kaa istemaal karke badi chaalaaki se aantarik suraksha vibhaag kii madad se yojana banaai

 i was taken to one room while others were let go which made me feel very humiliated
 mujhase is maamle par maafee bhi nahin maangi gai
 '' khan ne kaha ki unke paas maujuud rajanyik passport bhi kaam nahin aayaa or avrajan adhikariyon ne iskaa sammaan nahin kiya
 He said that till he came out, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav waited for him at the airport
 tippaniyan Khan said that a female officer came to him and said that forget what happened and pack your bags and leave from here, but he did not apologize or express any regret
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vahaan roke jane ke dauraan mujhase koi sawaal nahin kiya gaya or meraa maananaa he ki ve sajeesh rach rahe the or lekin ve ise anjaam nahin de sake

 Earlier news came that 5 near North Korea's nuclear test center on Wednesday morning
 1 tivrata kaa bukamp darj kiya gaya he
 However, an earthquake tracking body in China called it a suspected nuclear test
 is report ke aane ke saath hi japan or america ne bhi kaha tha ki vah maamle par najar banaae hue he or yah parmaanu pareekshan hi ho saktaa he
 However, soon after, the North Korean officially stated that it had successfully tested the powerful hydrogen bomb
 uttar korea ne kaha he ki usne apane pehle hydrogen bam kaa safaltaapurv pareekshan kiya he
 The state TV channel of North Korea confirmed the news saying that the test was conducted at 10 am

 According to officials in China and South Korea, 'there are signs that the reason is not natural
 iskaa matlab ye nikaala ja saktaa he ki uttar korea ne parmaanu pareekshan kiya ho
 'japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called the test a security threat to his country
 america ne kaha ki yah khatra puri duniya ke liye he or isapar vishwa samudaay uchit pratikriya degaa

 The 'S-400' is Russia's state-of-the-art missile defense system capable of surface-to-air hitting
 china ne rus se is pranali kii kharid ke liye 2014 main sabase pehle samjhauta kiya tha
 a five billion dollar agreement was signed between India and Russia to procure this system in October last year
 yah samjhauta pradhanmantri narendra modi or roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin ke bich vyapak charchaa ke baad hua tha
 a senior Foreign Ministry official told reporters on Thursday that the decision to buy the S-400 air defense system from Russia was important
 unhone is vichaar se asahmati jataayi ki yah koi badi baat nahin he
 The S400 missile defense system deal could result in US sanctions
 america congress ne rus se hathiyaaron kii kharid ko rokane ke liye countering americaj edwarsries thru senctions act (sieetise) kanoon banaaya tha
 And under this law, America can impose sanctions
 unhone kaha ki yadi bharat es-400 missile raksha pranali kharidne ke faisle par aage badhata he to usase raksha sambandhon par gambhir asar padegaa
 The official said that Trump Prashan clearly believes that buying Russia's advanced technology will send a wrong message to Russia even when it is taking an aggressive stance

 Justifying Navjot Singh Sidhu's statement, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said, "to achieve the big goals, you have to forget the differences
 
 
 " Nitish's statement is important for the Congress, because it came at a time when the Congress was supporting the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of demonetisation and the dahi-chura feast (the feast was canceled after the boat accident in the Ganges river)
 The BJP is embroiled in a debate with Nitish on several issues such as inviting BJP leaders

 co The recently formed contact group on civil nuclear issues between India and the US will meet for the first time in December
 yah lagbhag isaki ghoshnaa ke teen maah baad hoga
 Negotiations will be mainly on issues of nuclear liability
 bharat ko america newclear sansthaanon se haal hi main taaja adnge jhelane pade hai
 The US wants fresh bilateral security for final negotiations on the nuclear deal
 ye parmaanu-aprasar kii prakruti ke hai, jo pehle hi bharat main maujuud hai
 India and the United States have yet to make administrative arrangements to initiate this treaty
 modi-obama mulaakaat main kaaphi positive baton ke baavjood bharatiyon ko america vyavastha main 'sankatmochak' nahin mil rahe hai
 In fact, there is also a feeling in India that some elements in the American administration do not really want the nuclear deal to succeed
 yah ravaiya shaayad sheersh par nahin ho, lekin madhya str ke adhikariyon ke bich yah rog fail rahaa he or deal par pragati mushkil hoti ja rahi he
 One aspect of the matter is that if the Indians felt that the delay was being deliberate, it would be an adverse situation for American companies like Westinghouse and GE, who wanted to build nuclear reactors in India
 haalanki masalon kaa nipataara itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Apparently, on the issue of nuclear liability, India will have to be given considerable leeway to allow Indian and foreign companies to invest in nuclear energy
 saath hi, parmaanu urja ke liye nunatam mulya rakhana bhi ek chunauti hogi, jab vyavsaayik samjhaute kiye jaaenge
 However, the Indian side believes that both countries are far from that point
 alag karne kii yojana ke tahat, bharat ne swechha se apane naagarik or ranneetik kaarykram ke bich diwaar bana rakhi he
 The civilian sector will be entirely within the security cycle of the IAEA
 bharat ne ieie ke saath atirikt praavdhaan bana rakhaa he, jo aantarik jaanch kii ek or parat he
 These are all part of the indo-american deal
 haalanki, america parmaanu eendhan ke puure chakra ke dauraan ke liye ab taaja dwipaksheeya satyaapan chahta he
 India does not want to follow this path and believes that it will degrade international institutions like IAEA, as well as break the bind of bilateral agreements between countries
 gauratlab he ki modi-obama mulaakaat ke baad ghoshnaa hui ki bharat ne vaishvik parmaanu aprasar ke chaar samoohon- australia samooh, vasenar vyavastha, emticiar (missile technoboogy control rigim) or newclear saployrs group yani enesji main pravesh ke liye jaruri prakriya puri kar lee he
 India now wants to finish the whole process quickly
 haalanki, yah masalaa nae sampark samooh ke agenda par nahin he, bharat newclear deal main america raashtrapati kii patibaddhta ko jarur rekhaankit karnaa chahega, taaki parmaanu-aprasar ke in samoohon main uskaa pravesh ho sake
 When the green signal goes, India will be ready with a formal application
 aane vaale hafton main bharat, america ko is masale par gher saktaa he

 bharat ke purv captain dilip vengsarakar ne kaha ki bisisiai test maichon ko lekar adhik gambhir nahin he tathaa test maichon ke bich koi abhyaas match nahin rakhane ke kaaran bharat ko england ke haathon siries main 1-3 se haar jhelni padi
 Vengsarkar strongly criticized coach Duncan Fletcher and said that the entire coaching staff should be sacked immediately
 unhone captain mahendra singh dhoni kii netritvkshmata kii bhi aalochana kii
 Vengsarkar, who played 116 Test matches in his career, said of the Sandeep Patil-led selection committee that he was not a visionary
 lords main lagaataar teen test shatak lagane vaale vengsarakar se khaas baatcheet ke ansh is prakaar hai:paanch test maichon kii siries main is sharmnaak haar kaa aapaki najar main kya kaaran he?pehla or sabase ahm kaaran bisisiai test cricket ko bahut adhik mahatv nahin de rahaa he or iskaa saboot yah he ki paanch test maichon ke liye koi khaas taiyaari nahin kii gayi
 Apart from this, the program was also wrongly prepared
 test maichon ke bich main koi abhyaas match nahin rakhaa gaya jisase ki kharaab farm main chal rahe khilaadi farm main laut saken or baahar baithe saat rigerv khilaadiyon ko match abhyaas kaa mauka mili
 We took 18 players and we had almost the same number of so-called support staff
 gendbaaji 20 wicket lene main sakasham nahin dikh rahi thi or ballebaaj farm main nahin the
 He lacked not only the technique to play the moving ball but also the lack of commitment and combativeness
 ve bali ke bakre kii tarah dikh rahe the or unhone lagaataar ek jaisi galtiyaan kii
 i wonder what the batting, bowling and fielding coaches were doing? Was the team selected wrong here first and then in England? The job of the selectors was easy as they selected the team of the best possible 18 players
 unhone vikalp taiyaar karne ke bare main nahin sochaa
 He lacked vision and lacked courage to take tough decisions
 unhone sabase saral rasta chunaa
 Do you think the team's attention was distracted by the feud between Ravindra jadeja-james Anderson and India's insistence on banning Anderson? i don't think so
 aisi ghatnaayen test cricket kaa hissaa hai
 If such things affect you, then Test cricket is not the right place for you
 aise main aap test cricket nahin halke phulke khel kaa chunaav kar sakate hai
 How responsible do you consider Dhoni's captaincy and Fletcher's coaching for this defeat
 england, australia, dakshin africa, newjiland or ab england main lagaataar haar se kya in donon ko hataa dena chahie?dhoni ne team kii aguwai acchhee tarah se nahin kii
 His selection policy, strategy, fielding decor and bowling changes lacked practical understanding
 usne match dar match kuch badi galtiyaan kii jiskaa khamiyaja bharat ko bhugatna padaa
 It is his and India's misfortune that he has a coach like Duncan Fletcher who has no idea and does not know how to change things
 lagata he ki vah yuva team ko prerit nahin kar paa rahaa he
 The truth is that the support staff and the think tank demoralized the team badly
 ummid he ki bisisiai unhen turant prabhaav se barkhaast karegi

 But now after losing majority, this claim has received a big shock
 isse pehle europea union ke saath bregsit deal karne main naakaam hone par 7 june ko theresa me ne pradhanmantri ke pad se istipha de diya tha
 After becoming the Prime Minister of the UK, Boris Johnson promised the public that they would complete the Breguit process before 31 October, whatever it may be
 ab sansadeey bahumat khone ke baad unke liye raah bahut mushkil ho gai he
 Thousands of people are demonstrating in the UK these days on the streets of London
 log haathon main takhtiyaan lekar johnson awaas ke baahar 10 downing ke saamne jamaa hokar narebaaji kar rahe hai ki boris johnson unke pratinidhi nahin he
 Not only this, there are demonstrations against him in Central London, Belfast, York and other cities too
 samay se pehle aam chunaav kara sakate hampradhanmantri boris johnson ko 31 oktober tak vaada puraa karne ke liye samay se pehle aam chunaav kar jeet hasil kerani hogi
 According to the news agency Reuters, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson can hold a general election ahead of time if the opposition mps are able to pass the bill to pursue the Bregit deal
 britain main samay se pehle chunaav karaane ke liye vahaan ke kanoon ke anusaar pradhanmantri ko do tihaai saansadon kaa samarthan hasil karnaa padegaa
 But gaining this support will prove to be a major challenge for PM Johnson in the current situation
 jaankaron kaa anumaan he ki britain main aam chunaav 31 oktober se pehle karaae ja sakate hai, taaki 31 oktober kii dedline se pehle hi bregsit ko anjaam diya ja sake
 The proposal to suspend the sitting of Parliament approved the process of Britain's exit from the European Union called Breguit

 britain kii sansad main is vakt garmi kii chhuttiyaan chal rahi hai
 The proceedings of the British Parliament were to begin on 3 September

 For this he has also obtained permission from Queen Elizabeth
 philip lee ne kya kahaphilip lee ne ek bayaan main kaha ki jis party main ve 1992 main shaamil hue vah unki party nahin rahi, ve aaj use chhod rahe hai
 Lee accused his old party of politically influencing things and resorting to lies
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar asaidhantik rup se bregsit ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he or logon ke jivan or aajeevika ko jokhim main daal rahi he
 What did Johnson say when he met PM Modi? Conservative party MP of Indian origin Shailesh Vara asked British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on india-uk relations in the House of Common on Tuesday

 After the statement of US President Donald Trump mediating on the Kashmir issue, there was a fierce ruckus in both the houses on Tuesday
 vipakshi dal pradhanmantri modi se is masale par bayaan kii maang ko lekar vipakshi dalon ne loksabhaa se walk out kiya
 On this whole issue, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar hit back at the Congress, saying, "the statement which the US itself denied, even the Indian government has made it clear that no mediation about Kashmir is acceptable
 is
 uske baad bhi vipaksh ne jis tarah se rajyasabha main shor- sharaaba kiya wo nindaneey he
 At the same time, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi also attacked the Congress, saying, 'congress is frustrated and disappointed
 jis dhang se sadan main congress ke dwaara vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he, vah unka ahankaar he
 Today, the manner in which the arrogance of the Congress party in both the Houses is clear, it is clear that the rope was burnt but the force was not lost
 wo bhi chalaa jayega
 Further, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that this has happened to them while seeking answers from the Prime Minister
 inako janata jawaab de chuki he or 2024 main phir inako janata jawaab degi
 Naqvi says that India's stand is clear, there is no question of any arbitration in this matter
 is baar ke dilli chunaav main keval ek hi naam he jo siem ummidavaar ke taur par project kiya gaya he or vah he dilli ke purv mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jo aam aadmi party ke siem ummidavaar hai
 The BJP will not declare its CM candidate, as the party has now made its chief minister in three states under this strategy and the Congress is out of the race
 saath hi congress main siem ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii parampara hi nahin he, isliye kaayade se to dilli chunaav kaa ek hi cheharaa hai or vah hai arvind kejariwal
 Before i tell how this time, Arvind Kejriwal looks at me with a change
 arvind kejariwal ko main mangalvaar, 5 april 2011 se lagaataar cover kar rahaa hum jab ve lokapal kaa andolan karne ke liye jantar mantar par anna hazaare ke saath aae the
 i also saw the moment of Ramlila Maidan when the Central Government fell on its knees
 maine mumbai kaa anna hazaare kaa naakaam hua anshan bhi dekha, jiske baad puure lokapal andolan par sawaal khadey ho gaye the
 i saw how Kejriwal came to Hisar and appealed not to vote for Congress before entering politics
 kaise kejariwal anshan par baithe to ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ke taur par
 
 
 
 
 And Jantar came out of Mantar by becoming a leader and forming a political party
 meri hi ankhon ke saamne ye party bani
 
 
 i also saw the whole struggle
 
 
 8 disambar ko party ne sabko chaunkaaya tha tab bhi
 
 
 Even after becoming Kejriwal, he became the Chief Minister
 
 
 kejariwal ne istifa diya tab bhi
 
 
 Even when PM went to confront Modi
 
 
 loksabhaa main bura pradarshan kiya tab bhi
 
 
 All i saw with my eyes and showed the world
 
 
 in sabake dauraan kejariwal se lagaataar meraa samvaad bhi chalata rahaa he
 i have covered hundreds of public meetings of Kejriwal so far and now i can see Kejriwal in change
 saal 2014 main kejariwal apni jansabha main nakaaratmak prachaar karte nazar aate the, lekin ab unka style badal chukaa he
 In 2014, he had a direct attack on PM Narendra Modi, he used to tell people that in some circumstances vote for Modi ji or else what will happen
 
 
 gas mahangi ho jaaegi, mahangaai bad jaaegi, vagairah-vagairah
 
 
 But now in his public meeting he is far from attacking PM Modi, he does not even take his name
 
 
 haa hamale zarur karte hai lekin bijepi kii centre sarkaar par narend modi par nahin
 Rather i would say that this time Kejriwal and AAP are campaigning like Modi or BJP were campaigning in Lok Sabha elections
 
 
 keval apni 49 din kii sarkaar kii vaahvahee or agar sarkaar bani to kya karenge ye sab bataaya ja rahaa he, jabaki piem modi kii raily main bijepi ke sabhi netaa or khud piem narendra modi ne us tarah hamale kiye jaise pichhali baar kejariwal or aap karti thi
 While campaigning in the Lok Sabha elections, the media used to target Kejriwal a lot
 
 
 ek kaarykram main to unhone yah tak kah diya tha ki in mediawaalon ko jail main daalenge, jis par bahut vivaad hua lekin party ne chaar news channelon kaa naam lekar kah diya ki ye bike hue hai or ped news dikhaa rahe hai
 
 
 But now Kejriwal attacks the media in his own way as if he used to say, "when i said that i would reduce the electricity rate by half, these media persons made a big joke of me" Hearing this, the public laughs and claps
 
 
 kejariwal kehete hai, 'agar main gujarat kii siem anandiben patel kii tarah 100 karod rupee kaa helicopter le letaa siem banakar to media vaale kehete ki veri good cheef minister veri progressive cheef ministar'
 
 
 Hearing this, the public again laughs and claps and looks towards the media persons who are covering the crowd
 yah kejariwal kaa nayaa andaaz he, jisamen vah media ke prati jo unke dil kaa dard he vah baahar nikaalte hai
 
 
 They take public sympathy and actually do not say anything to the media
 loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt bhaashan dete vakt vah khaase aakraamak rahete the, lekin aaj ek dam aaraam se apni baat kehete hai
 In the last assembly election, Kejriwal used to seriously explain his things to the people, such as how the Congress government looted the public by corruption or how he left his job and entered politics, but this time he used to laugh at the people with seriousness
 Are also
 jaise ki vah mahangaai ke mudde par kehete hai ki mere siem rahete aalu itane rupee kilo the or aaj itane guna mahangaa ho gaya or phir vah apane andaaz main kehete hai ki bataao in bijepi waalon se aalu tak nahin sanbhala
 
 
 The public laughs a lot
 kejariwal sidhi si bhashaa main janata ko vah bolte hai jo uski rozmarra kii samasya he or janata aasaani se samaj sakati he
 Kejriwal talks of corruption, but not the Lokpal, whereas Kejriwal had given his resignation only on this issue
 shaayad vah maanate hai ki public lokapal se utana acha conect nahin karti, jitna chote chote bhrashtachar ke maamalon se or police kii haftaa vasuuli se
 Though the issue of Lokpal is not visible in the talks of Kejriwal and AAP, but the party is saying that it will be discussed further
 pehle kejariwal janata ko danke kii chot par seenaa thok kar kehete the ki haa maine istipha diya apane usulon or aadarshon par diya, lekin ab vah saafe saafe kehete hai, 'maine istifa diya meri galati thi or ek baat to maine raajnneeti main sikh lee he
 
 
 
 kuch bhi ho jaae istifa mat do' The way Kejriwal speaks is that the public cheers and claps
 kejariwal phir kehete hai ki pehle bahumat nahin tha kuch kami rah gai thi, lekin abaki baar bahumat do paanch saal tak kaam karke dikhaaenge
 Kejriwal now also does emotional and says to the people, 'my heart only knows how i was running the government with the support of the Congress' Kejriwal then hit a punch and said that he resigned or did not commit any theft
 janata is baat par bhi khub tali bajaati dikhti he
 Kejriwal's style has changed, but not the tone
 kejariwal ke mafalar pahanane par virodhiyon unka khub mazaaq udaaya, soshal media par chutkule bhi chale, lekin aap iskaa jawaab twitor par lambey samay tak mafalaraman shabd ko trand karakar virodhiyon ko jawaab diya
 Also, where Kejriwal used to wear the same muffler earlier, he wears two mufflers and now he does not come in front of the public without a muffler
 khud maine unako haal hi main kaha ki agar ve is tarah mafalar naa pahane, isse vah syrius se nahin lagate
 On this she said that the public does not think so
 
 
 or yah kahkar hansate hue chale gaye
 It shows a kind of confidence or else a reporter covering an old party like me would say that any leader would think once
 
 
 vaise kejariwal ko yah pehle se samasya he ki diabatiz hone kii vajah se sardiyon main ek baar khaansee or galaa baithna shuru hota he to vah puri sardi chalata he
 i mentioned this incident because when i met Arvind Kejriwal one day after the defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, i started telling him his mistakes that you should not have done or done this thing
 (ham patrakaron ke paas har kisi ke liye salaah hoti he or maargdarshan rahata he) So while i was telling Arvind, Arvind was listening and obeying
 main yah dekhakar hairaan tha ki is shaks ne ek samay main bade dhurandaron ko hawa main uda diya tha or vah aaj aise meri har baat sun rahaa he
 There was no such thing as self-confidence, but see, Arvind has not won anything since that day means no elections are won, but seeing confidence, there is a difference by looking at body language
 ek or udhaaharan dekar apni baat khatm karata hum
 When Arvind Kejriwal was coming to meet the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi as the CM nominee, i met him to interview him
 
 
 arvind par pehali nazar padi ko dekha arvind ke chehre par kisi tarah khushi nahin dikhi, balki aisa lag rahaa tha jane unhen koi jabaran siem bana rahaa ho
 That is, any happiness that was found after such a surprise victory and cm's chair did not show any special interest or fascination in his mind
 maine sochaa log jane kab se siem banane ke liye kya kya tikadam karke bhi jindagi bhar siem nahin ban pate or ye hai ki
 
 
 i was congratulating and did not appear to be in a mood to thank
 lekin ab dekhie mukhyamantri banane ke liye vah apni jaan daanv par lagaae hue hai
 
 
 The election has been announced on January 12, but has been up to two months before the election campaign
 dilli kii sari sadaken, bas stand, vagairah par aap ke poster, radio par aap kaa vigyaapan, rojaanaa do jansabha, rojaanaa chanda jutaney ke liye chaay coffee lunch dinar do shabdon main kahen to jaan hi daanv par he
 Actually, Kejriwal is only two years old, but in these two years he has seen and learned a lot
 
 
 or is baat ko samajha ki raajnneeti main bane rahane ke liye kya zaruri he
 What to give up and what to hold
 
 
 ek samay tha jab aisa lagata tha ki kejariwal bolkar sochate hai, lekin aaj vah soch samajhakar hi bolte hai or isliye badale-badale se kejariwal nazar aate hai- dekhen, raajnneeti kii dhul-aandhi main ye badlaav kab tak kaayam rahata he
 But the question here is that will the people of Delhi be able to forgive Arvind Kejriwal for his resignation? Is it so that Kejriwal delayed to change? This is the question which you and we will see on 10 February

 It was like an accident waiting to happen
 amritsar railway stesan se thodi hi duuri ek chote se maidan dhobi ghat par kai varshon se dashahra utsav hota aa rahaa he
 This time, on October 19, a crowd watching Ravana Dahan while standing on the railway tracks passed through a DMU train, and 60 people were killed and 143 were seriously injured
 is baar kaa ravan dahan kaarykram pehle se zyada bhavy or vishaal tha kyonki punjab ke paryaton or sthaneey prashasan mantri navjot singh siddhu or unki patni navjot cor, iske mukhya atithi ke rup main khaastaur par aamantrit the
 The organizers of the event — local Parshad Vijay Madan and his son Saurabh Madan — had also informed the city police that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the event
 din dhalane par jab ravan ke 60 foot oonche putale main aag lagaai gai to putale main bhare kareeb 5,000 pataakhe footne lage
 The rail tracks passing through Dhobi Ghat are high
 so, darjanon log ravan dahan kaa behatar najaara dekhne ke liye rail patariyon par khadey ho gaye
 In the noise of firecrackers, no one heard the horn of a train running at a speed of more than 80 kmph
 is durghatana main bal-bal bache ek sthaneey nivasee surinder kumaar kehete hai, ''pataakhon kii aawaaj bahut tej thi
 Therefore the horn was not heard
 '' surinder batch gaye kyonki us samay ve rail patari se chand foot peeche hat gaye the
 In a few seconds, the celebration of Dussehra turned into mourning
 is dukhad ghatana ke baad jo ho rahaa he, vah bhi utana hi pareshaan karne vaala he
 The Indian Railways was the first to clear any responsibility for the accident
 ghatana ke 24 ghanton se bhi kam samay main, railway board ke chairman ashvini lohani ne maare gaye logon ko railway ke kshetra main anadhikaar pravesh karne kaa doshi tehra diya
 Lohani said, "railways cannot be held responsible for this tragedy
 main (jalandhar-amritsar) line ke paas yojit kaarykram ke bare main railway ko jaankaree nahin di gai thi
 People were watching the festival near the main line where there is no restriction on the speed of the train
 logon ko patariyon par atikaraman nahin karnaa chahie
 Earlier, Union Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha had also made it clear that no punitive action would be taken against the railway employees
 rail mantri ne kaha, ''is durghatana main railway kii koi galati nahin
 There has been no lapse on our part and no action will be initiated against the driver
 ''jahaan durghatana hui thi, vahaan se joda phatak 300 meter se adhik dur nahin he
 His gateman Amit Singh must have seen a large number of people coming to see the Dussehra program standing on the railway tracks
 phir bhi usne aane vaali train ko satark karne yaa phir manavala yaa amritsar ke stesan mastaron ko suchit nahin kiya
 If the gateman had shown his agility, many precious lives could have been saved by stopping the passing trains or reducing the speed
 rail line ke najadik bane gharon main rahane vaale log kehete hai ki dhobi ghat kaa dashahra ek dashak se bhi adhik samay se amritsar ke bade aayojanon main gina jaataa he
 In previous years, the speed of trains passing during Ravana combustion was low
 dukhad he ki 19 aktubar ko aisa nahin hua
 Ferozepur Divisional Railway Manager Vivek Kumar insisted that this has never happened
 unka kahana he, ''hamaare driveron ko hameshaa ucchtam sweekrut gati par train ko daudane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 He said that the double track between Amritsar and Jalandhar is safe for speeds up to 110 kmph
 vivek kehete hai ki ateet main kisi stesan par rail trek ke khaali na hone ke kaaran train kii gati kam rakhi gai hogi jise logon ne aisa samaj liya ho ki yahaan gati kam kar di jaati he
 Interestingly, two former railway ministers have questioned the attitude of railway officials
 chandigarh main pawan kumaar bansal aashcharya vyakt karte hai ki kya amritsar main railway adhikari dhobi ghat main hone vaale dashahra utsav kii 'aadhikarik taur par' jaankaree milane kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 They ask what the two gatemen posted at the pair gate, the gangmen who periodically inspect the tracks, the drivers of the vehicles passing through them, all of whom would not have seen such a huge effigy of Ravana standing several days ago
 dinesh trivedi bhi railway ke pallaa jhaad lene se hairaan the
 "people have been crushed and whatever punishment for this serious crime will be reduced," says Trivedi
 yah system dwaara kiya gaya ek aapraadhik krity tha
 "the former railway minister said on TV that if the system is to be reformed, responsibilities have to be fixed
 bansal ne kaha ki rail mantralay ko ghani aabaadi vaale kshetron se guzarane vaali patariyon ke aasapaas gheraabandi par praathamikta ke aadhaar par vichaar karnaa chahie
 The tragedy in Amritsar points to the serious negligence of almost every department
 aayojak madan, jo is ghatana ke baad gaayab he, ne 15 aktubar ko kaarykram ke aayojan ke liye police se anumati maangi thi or suraksha vyavastha kaa bhi anurodh kiya tha
 Nevertheless, the SHO of the local Mokhampur police station did not even inspect the venue, other than instructing to be careful in using loudspeaker
 isse bhi badi laaparvaahee yah rahi ki or yah avishwasaneey bhi he ki bheed-prabandhan or viypi kii suraksha ke liye keval 30 consteble tainaat kiye gaye the! pratyakshdarshi kehete hai ki pulisavaale mukhya atithi navjot cor (siddhu nahin aae) ke aasapaas hi rahe, patariyon par baari sankhya main jamaa logon ko andekha kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, Madan has also shown a letter of approval to Amritsar Municipal Corporation to several correspondents, while both the city's Mayor Karanjit Singh Rintu and Municipal Corporation Commissioner Sonali Giri have denied it
 giri kaa kahana he ki shahar main yojit ho rahe 29 dashahra kaaryakramon main se vastav main keval chaar ko eemasi se purv anumati praapt thi
 Nevertheless, it is surprising that the corporation did not take any steps to stop unauthorized celebrations
 is traasadee ke baad hi shahar ke adhikari kumbhakarni neend se jaage hai or police, nagar nigam, peedblyoody or swasthya adhikariyon se manjuuri lene kii jarurat kii baaten shuru hui hai
 This is the truth of every municipal corporation, every city in the country
 haryana police ke purv adhikari rajbir desawaal, jinhone aapadaa prabandhan ke liye epabiai (america main) ke saath training kii he, kehete hai ki prashasan, police or anya agenciyon ko aisi paristhitiyon se nipatane main adhik mustaid hona chahie
 He cites the Disaster Management Act 2005, "which talks about building systems but is insufficient to" prevent disasters and minimize damage "
 ''amritsar train traasadee ko jahaan eemaandaaree ke saath vyavastha kii khaamiyon kii pahchaan karke use durust karne kaa nazeer bananaa chahie tha, vah apane hisse kii jabaavadehi ko duusare par taalane or har galati ke liye ungali duusare kii ore uthaane kii ek misaal ban gaya he
 What is happening after this scary, painful accident is even more frightening, it was the Indian Railways that first shook hands, the Chairman of the Railway Board blamed those who died for encroaching on the railway tracks
 upi ke khanan ghotaale main sibiai akhilesh yadav se poochtacha kar sakati he
 When Akhilesh Yadav had the Ministry of Mining, 14 tenders were passed at that time
 khanan ghotaale par sibiai sakht hui to samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress khulkar saamne aa gaye, ab teenon vipakshi dal bijepi sarkaar par sajeesh kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 In fact, the CBI investigating the illegal mining case claimed that the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's office had cleared 13 mining leases in a single day
 akhilesh ne 14 khanan patton ko manjuuri di thi jisamen 13 ko 17 farvari 2013 ko manjuuri di gai thi
 This was done in violation of the e-tendering process
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki 2012 kii i-tender niti kaa ulanghan karte hue mukhyamantri karyaalay se manjuuri hasil karne ke baad 17 farvari ko hamirpur kii jiladhikari bi chandrakala ne khanan patte die the
 The e-tender policy was approved by the Allahabad High Court on 29 January 2013
 is bich akhilesh yadav ne kaha he ki bhaajapa apni sari maryaadaayen bhuulakar khud sibiai kii jagah baith gai he
 So far no notice or summons have come from the CBI
 tab bhaajapa sarkaar ke mantrigan kis sanvaidhanik adhikaar se kathith aarope lagane kaa dussahas kar rahe hai

 Bombing has been happening throughout the year in the world of politics

 When Kejriwal exploded the Gadkari bomb on the BJP side, everyone was shocked

 When Kejriwal threw a bomb on Robert Vadra, son-in-law of 10 Janpath, Baba threw two-four on his behalf
 baba saal bhar bam phodte rahe, lekin congressi hansate rahe
 We have also heard them say that Baba's bomb has no merit because people do not take Baba seriously

 Lord Ram started seeing a bad husband to his lawyer

 When the bomb exploded, the sound faded far away

 Those who are with the BJP in the name of religion started throwing bombs on the bomb of Ramjethmalani
 jethmalani ne ram par bam kya phoda, jaise ram naam japti bijepi par hi bam oochaal diya

 It is not just about IPL

 He is also a superb fielder

 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘yah dekhakar acha lagata he ki gharelu cricket ke pradarshan ko dekha gaya
 You can always argue that the IPL is a domestic tournament but for me Ranji Trophy, Syed Mushtaq Ali, Vijay Hazare are tournaments in which performance should really matter when the national team is selected
 ’’ UP Congress General Secretary Umesh Pandit has launched a major attack on Congress National Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi hi upi main haar ke liye jimmedaar hai, kyonki unhone us sapa se gathbandhan kiya jiske khilaaf anti inakambency thi
 BJP had planted Prashant Kishor! Umesh Pandit has blamed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi directly for the defeat
 ajtak se baatcheet main umesh pandit ne kaha kiraahul gandhi apane ird-gird jo team chuni he vah galat he or unako bhramit karti he
 It does not give the right feedback, so it is also the responsibility of Rahul Gandhi to either change his team, change himself or clear the way for the Congress people and Priyanka Gandhi
 prashanth kishorako laakar congress kaa nuksaan kiya gaya
 It seems that Prashant Kishor was planted by the BJP
 rus kii tennis star maaria sharapova par do saal kaa pratibandh laga diya gaya he
 This Russian player was immediately banned in March
 unhen janvari main hue australian open ke dauraan pratibandhit drugs meldonium ke istemaal kaa doshi paaya gaya tha
 After this, the International Tennis Association banned him from playing tennis in his competitions
 meldonium kaa istemaal dil kii beemaari ke liye hota he
 Sharapova (29) has been using the drugs since 2006
 lekin 1 janvari 2016 ko wada ne ise pratibandhit dawaaon kii suchi main shaamil kar liya
 But Sharapova was found guilty of using it
 tippaniyan Sharapova has been banned for the next two years from 26 January 2016
 paanch grand slam vijeta sharapova ke bain ke baad kaafii vivaad bhi hue
 But now she has been convicted of doping and she will not appear on the tennis circuit for the next two years
 sharapova ne itieff ke is faisale ke kilaaf apni naaraazgi jataai he or fesabook par likhaa he ki wo is faisale ke kilaaf apil karengi
 He wrote, "I do not accept the decision of two years of suspension
 " unka maananaa he ki itieff ne unke kilaaf do saal bain kaa hi faisalaa sunaaya he jisase saafe ho jaataa he ki unhone meldonium kaa istemaal anjaane main hi kiya
 Meldonium is used for heart disease
 sharapova (29) is drugs kaa istemaal 2006 se kar rahi thim
 But on 1 January 2016, Wada added it to the list of banned drugs
 magar sharapova iske istemaal kii doshi pai gayi
 The comments sharapova par 26 janvari 2016 se agle do saal ke liye pratibandh laga diya gaya he
 There were also many controversies following the ban of five Grand Slam winners Sharapova
 lekin ab unhen doping kaa doshi paaya gaya he or agle do saal wo tennis circuit par nahin dikhaai dengi

 unhone likhaa he, " main do saal ke suspension ke faisale ko sweekaar nahin karti
 "he believes that the ITF has decided against him for a two-year ban, which shows that he used meldonium unknowingly

 Indian Railways has taken another step towards modernity
 railway ne apane titii ko atyaadhunik handeld terminal (echechati) de diya he
 Handheld terminals have been provided to ticket checking staff of Sampoorna Kranti Express
 is terminal se ab unhen yatriyon kaa tikat check karne or agle stesan par aarakshan sthiti kii soochna online mil jaaegi
 This will allow TT to make tickets inside the moving vehicle and can also see which seat is vacant and which ticket is canceled
 sampurna kranti express kii gaadi sankhya 12393 / 12394 he or yah rajendra nagar-nai dilli-rajendra nagar ke bich chalati he
 The position of the seats in the train is constantly updated through the Internet-connected terminal to the handheld terminal, so that if a seat is left vacant in the moving train, it can be allocated to the passengers as per rules
 purv madhya rail main handeld terminal ke sathtikat checking kii shuruyatpichley saal 14 disambar se patna rajdhani main kii gai thi
 Benefits of handheld terminal - Passengers boarding the train from the next station will get information about seat availability in real time
 -pratiksharat tikat vaale yatriyon ke liye khaali seat kii uplabdhta adhik hogi jisase yatri santushti badhegi
 - Higher rail bookings will increase railway earnings
 -digital india kii pahal ko badhaava milegaa
 - Work with handheld terminal more convenient for checking staff and working with gadgets will also increase their self-esteem
 -checking staff ko rigerveshan chart lekar nahin chalanaa padegaa jisase kaagaj kii bachat hogi or paryaavaran sangrakshan main bhi madad milegi
 There is still a possibility of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reaching Parliament
 unke banaras se nahin ladane ke peeche kai tarah ke tark die gaye
 
 
 Mayawati reiterated the tradition of not saying, not fighting any member of the Gandhi family against big leaders
 
 Things were also said
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki priyanka ko amethi or mayawati par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 But this does not mean that Priyanka cannot become an MP
 ab yadi congress sutron kii maane to priyanka raibareli se ladanaa chaahati thim
 After Sonia Gandhi's election there, she had made up her mind to fight against Benaras, but there was no talk of that
 rahul or sonia nahin chaahate the ki priyanka kaa rajnatik karier haar ke saath shuru ho
 Now reports are coming that if Rahul Gandhi leaves whichever seat of Amethi or Wayanad, Priyanka can be contested from there
 itnaa to tay mana ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi amethi or vynad donon jagahon se chunaav jeetne vaale hai
 Elections have been held in Wayanad in Kerala and there has been tremendous voting in Wayanad due to Rahul Gandhi contesting from there
 or jo report aa rahi he usase lagata he ki vynad rahul jeet rahe hai
 It is about Amethi, on which Smriti Irani is definitely pushing, but no one doubts Rahul's victory
 amethi gandhi parivaar kaa garh rahaa he or sanjay gandhi ke samay se yah seat gandhi parivaar ke paas he
 In 1980, Sanjay Gandhi won for the first time from here
 bich main satish sharma bhi congress ke tikat par chunaav jite
 For the year 1998-99, Sanjay Singh definitely won from here on BJP ticket
 isliye priyanka gandhi ke liye in donon siton se jeetne main koi pareshaani nahin hone vaali he
 Therefore, the argument also ends here that the first election should not be fought to lose
 magar sau baat kii ek baat ki kya rahul is baar priyanka gandhi ke liye hami bharenge
 Although Priyanka has been appointed to prepare for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, but even if she becomes an MP in 2019, the party will get a lot of strength in Purvanchal for which Priyanka will have to fight Amethi
