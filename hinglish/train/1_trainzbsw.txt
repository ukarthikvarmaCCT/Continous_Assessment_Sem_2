 The BJP is also doing a great deal
 
 
 akhilesh yadav ne gathbandhan ke sawaal par kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi mahagathbandhan ko mahamilawat kehete hai
 But the truth is that the BJP is forming an alliance from Tamil Nadu to the Northeast
 wo khud milawat kar rahe hai or ham par aarope laga rahe hai

 Taking advantage of LK Advani's marginalization and the new president Nitin Gadkari not yet being identified, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is aggressively presenting himself at the National Executive meeting held here
 shahar main adwani or gadakari se zyada tathaa unke katout se vishaal katout modi ke lage hai
 Not only this, all the newspapers published from Patna today have full page ads of Modi alone
 ye vigyaapan party kii ore se nahin balki, khud modi kii taraf se prakashit karaae gaye hai
 In these big cutouts, Modi has been accused of "hindu Hriday Samrat" by teasing the Chief Minister of the state, who did not allow the Chief Minister of Gujarat to come to the state in the promotion of any elections held in Bihar since 2004
 Slogans like "we welcome the people of Bihar who support Bihar and Biharis are welcome" on earth and in advertisements published in newspapers

 is vigyaapan main yah nahin bataaya gaya he ki ise kisne prakashit karaayaa he lekin bihar ke vibhinn kshetron ke logon ke naam isamen die gaye hai
 But who these people are, is not known

 Till the assembly elections, Nitish Kumar, who had an alleged anti-muslim image in the campaign, kept Nitish Kumar from coming to the state saying "one Modi is enough, what other Modi (narendra) needs"

 Advertisement published in newspapers has put a photo of an unknown Bihar resident along with a big photo of Modi and it reads "gujarat
 mere ghar se dur meraa ghar’’
 It also states on behalf of some unknown Biharis that Gujarat has always stood by it in the hour of Bihar's crisis
 isamen kaha gaya he ‘‘gujarat apana janmasthan chhod kar gaye hamaare jaise kai logon ke liye ghar se dur ek ghar he or yah aisi jagah he jahaan hamane sammaan, shanti or apaar avasaron kaa samaan manch paaya

 - With minimal makeup, sequins work and glitter-making have been made a part of their fashion by Bollywood actresses

 - Blouse matching with sari has become an old fashion thing
 fishan main bane rahane ke liye ab ise paaramparikjacket ke saath pahanen
 You can create a new garment by mixing different costumes
 - pastel shades ko chatkh rangon ke saath pahanen or print ke saath mix match karen
 You can give it a traditional look by wearing an embroidered Westcoat with a salwar kameez yajamp suit

 Kangana looked very attractive in a film scene in an orange-colored suit, but avoid wearing the same color from head to toe
 16 saal pehle landan se bharat ain actress katrina caff ne bollywood main apni alag pahchaan banaai he
 After her Bollywood debut with the film Boom, Katrina was helped by Salman Khan to get a good start in the industry
 haalanki katrina ne maatr salmaan khan kii heroin banane ke bajaae industry main apni alag pahchaan banaai
 Apart from Salman, he has also worked in films with Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan and has also received appreciation
 apni acting, glamer, chemistry or afares ke liye katrina kaaphi charchaa main rahi hai
 His looks, holiday photos, fashion sense and films are all crazy
 lekin ek baat jiske liye katrina kii charchaa kam hi hoti he wo he vivaad
 This is rarely the case of Katrina Kaif
 eks boyfriend ho yaa koi actress yaa phir media se unke rishte, har kisi ke saath katrina apane rishte ko positive banaakar chalane main vishwaas rakhti hai
 As a proof of this, Katrina can have a relationship with Salman Khan

 The two had a breakup and things went wrong
 haalanki tab bhi katrina kaa rishta salmaan ke parivaar ke sadasyon ke saath kaaphi acha tha or aaj unki dosti salmaan se itani badhiya he ki salmaan unki tarif karte nahin thakte
 Apart from this, Katrina is also in friendship with Ranbir after being in a relationship with Ranbir Kapoor and bitter breakup

 Let us know that you will see Katrina Kaif with Akshay Kumar in the film Suryavanshi
 daanpaty jivan main pati-patni ke bich aapasi vishwaas behad jaruri hota he
 But sometimes, bitterness starts in the relationship due to doubt
 kuch patiyon ko apni patni ke kuch kaamon se shaq hone lagata he
 Some similar work or behavior is discussed further
 
 
 1
 If the wife spends more time on mobile, if a married woman talks more on mobile or is more active on Whatsapp, Facebook, then there is an increased possibility of doubt in the husband's mind
 koi jaruri nahin ki is tarah ke shaq kii koi thos buniyaad ho hi
 2
 pati kii gairmaujuudagi main baahar janaagar patidev kii gairmaujuudagi main koi mahila baar-baar akele ghar se baahar jaati he, to vah pati kii najaron main shaq ke daayre main aa sakati he
 3
 partiyon main duusare mardon se hanskar baaten karanaagar mahila partiyon main jaakar duusaren mardon se zyada meljol badhaane kii koshish kare or hans-hanskar baaten kare, to pati ke man main chubhan ho sakati he, jo ki aage chalakar shaq main tabdeel ho sakati he
 4
 sajane-sanvarne par zyada dhyanam taur par mahilaon main sajane-sanvarne kii pravriti purushon kii tulana main zyada hoti he
 But the same thing can sometimes be passed on to men
 5
 Talking about the office even after coming home, if a working woman talks more about the office colleagues in front of her husband, then it can cause doubt in the husband's mind
 vaise to aaj ke daur main mahilaayein bhi purushon ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar aage bad rahi hai, par purushavaadi maansikta ke shikaar log bina kisi thos vajah ke apane man main shaq ke beej bo sakate hai, jo saraasar galat he

 In response to the brutal attack on innocent school children, Pakistan has opened the way to punish the terrorists
 pakistan sarkaar kade kadam uthaakar aatankiyon se sakhti se pesh aane ke sanket de rahi he, or varsh 2008 se faansee par lagi roak ko hataate hue pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz sharif ne saaf kar diya he ki faansee kii sazaa paae kaidiyon ko suuli par latakaane ke blike warrant ek-do din main jari honge

 Apart from removing the hanging, Nawaz Sharif also talked about the speedy disposal of cases related to terror
 lekin khud marane-maarane par utaaru taharik-e-taliban pakistan par kya iskaa koi asar hoga
 The roots of terror have become so deep in Pakistan that such steps will not overwhelm the suicide bombers
 unhen post or khatm karne ke liye raajnneetik ichhashakti chahie
 Sharif himself today admitted that not one, after his coming to power, talks were held at least twice to get the terrorists on the way, but it was fruitless
 bharat ko apana sabase bada dushman maanane vaale pakistan ko aaj sabase bada khatra charampanthi or kattarpanthi takaton se he, jinaki saraparasti main aatank kaa nasoor pakistan kii nai peedi par kal kahar banakar tutaa
 The answer should be asked to leaders of the Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf party like Imran Khan, whose sympathy for the hardliners and the militant Tanzeem is not hidden from anyone
 jab dusron ke liye lagaai aag kii lapten apni hi chadar ko pakad len to samaj lenaa chahie ki aag ko zamin par hi nahin, dimag main bhi shant karnaa zaruri he

 Pakistan's army, once fueled by the blasts and attacks in Afghanistan, gave the Taliban a thriving dose, gave shelter to Waziristan and the North West Frontier Province to hide its head, today the same Taliban is camping in Afghanistan and showing eyes to Pakistan 
 aatank kii fasal boi he to kaatani to padegi
 
 
 If the hands are now riddled with thorns, Pakistan should get rid of canker made by itself

 On Sunday, Rahul Gandhi started his campaign for the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 rahul ne maharashtra ke kai ilaakon main tabadatod jansabhaayen kin
 During this, Rahul mentioned in his speeches to surround the Modi government and BJP, from Rafael to Nirav Modi and Gabbar Singh tax
 yani jin muddon ko rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hathiyaar banaaya, unheen kaa jrik maujuuda vidhansabha main bhi rahul ne kiya
 Rahul Gandhi held public meetings in Latur, Chandavali and Dharavi in maharashtra on the very first day of campaigning
 rahul ne apni pehali raily main hi notebandi or bank ghotaalon kaa zikr kiya
 Rahul said, 'modi used to say that if demonetization is not good then hang me
 magar notebandi se kiskaa phayda hua, neerav modi to bhaag gaya
 'rahul said,' Demonetisation in November 2016 and GST thereafter has shaken the country's economy
 automobile se textile tak or hira se lekar chote vyavsaayon tak kaa bura haal he
 More than 2,000 factories have closed in Maharashtra alone, while 'thieves' like Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi have escaped from the country by looting
 kahaan gaye achche din?rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'aap desh main kahin bhi jaaie, log sirf berogari, krishibhumi sankat or arthvyavastha kii baat kar rahe hai

 Nothing to the farmers, to industrialists, Rahatrahul Gandhi alleged that the farmers are constantly troubled and the government in the last few years, about 5 of the 15 big industrialists
 50 lakh karod ke karj maaf kar die
 Rahul said that the government gave tax rebates last month to big industrialists 1
 45 karod rupee kaa diwali gift diya, lekin kisaanon ko koi chhot nahin di gai
 The echo of Rafael Viman and Chowkidar Chor Hai was also heard at the gathering of Rafael and Chowkidar Chor Hai
 kandivali kii raily main jab rahul gandhi ne rafel vimaan deal main chori kaa aarope lagaaya to chaukeedaar chor he kaa naaraa bhi sunai diya
 All these issues are those which were raised loudly by Rahul Gandhi during the Lok Sabha elections held five months ago
 rahul gandhi ko yakeen tha ki in muddon par janata bijepi ko sabak sikhayegi or congress satta main vaapasi karegi
 But on May 23, when the results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 came, the whole picture changed and the public sealed the tremendous return of the Modi government by winning more seats to the BJP
 vahiin, duusari taraf congress 2014 ke nateezon tak hi simit rah gai
 That is, in two consecutive Lok Sabha elections, the people of the country rejected the Congress outright and all the issues raised by Rahul Gandhi failed
 maharashtra-haryana chunaav main 370 ko mudda banane main juty bijepi, congress kaa kinarub rahul gandhi ne phir unheen muddon ko uthaaya he
 Whereas BJP is contesting elections on the basis of big issues like removing Section 370 from Kashmir and enacting laws on triple talaq
 rahul gandhi kah rahe hai ki notebandi, rojgaar or ghotaalon jaise jwalanth muddon par dhyaan kendrit karne or charchaa karne ke bajaay, sarkaar logon ko yah dikhaane main vyast he ki bhartiya chandrayan rocket ko kaise chandramaa par bheja gaya
 At the same time, Rahul says that Article 370, Pakistan, China, Japan, Korea, etc
 are being talked about in Jammu and Kashmir, but remember that this rocket will not help to feed millions of hungry

 The disclosure of NCP chief Sharad Pawar's nephew and former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has hit the Congress's forehead
 sholapur jile ke karmala tehsil main yojit apni haalia sabha main ajit pavaar ne do took shabdon main daawa kiya ki congress ke purv pradhanmantri pivi narsingh raav kii sarkaar bachaane ke liye saansadon kii kharid-farokht hui thi
 Addressing the gathering from the stage in his familiar style, Ajit Pawar said that when he first became MP in 1991, Narasimha Rao's government was running short of a few mps for a majority
 aise main kuch saansad tode gaye
 That too for just 50-50 lakh rupees
 aisi jaankaree unhen thi

 jis chunaav kshetra kii baad main lambey samay tak unke chachaa sharad pavaar ne numaaindgi kii
 Before his statement, Ajit Pawar did not miss to tell that there was a time when MP or MLA was sold for 50 lakh rupees
 aajkal to ek parshad itane paise main nahin tuutata
 The Congress has come forward on this statement
 ajit pavaar kaa bayaan tab aayaa he jab maharashtra main nikaay chunaav ke liye aachaar samhita lagu ho chuki he or congress-ensipi gathbandhan kaa faisla hona baaki he

 ajit pavaar jo kah rahe hai uski behatar soochna unheen ke paas hogi

 The constituency which was later represented by his uncle Sharad Pawar for a long time
 apane is bayaan se pehle ajit pavaar yah bataane se bhi nahin chuke ki ek samay tha jab 50 lakh rupee main saansad yaa vidhayak bikta tha
 Nowadays a councilor does not break into this much money
 is bayaan par congress sakate main aa chuki he
 Ajit Pawar's statement comes after the code of conduct for the civic elections in Maharashtra has come into force and the congress-ncp alliance is yet to be decided
 tippaniyan In such a situation, former Chief Minister of Ajit Pawar and Maharashtra Congress President Ashok Chavan has denied this disclosure in a hurry

 The first thing is that who is that idiot who will tell what a girl should wear
 2
 The loser was not afraid of what he would get by attacking an unarmed, unprepared and fully engaged girl in her work
 3
 If actresses are insecure with such dirty minded people, then what do those girls who come to work here
 4
 This makes me realize that a person may think that he can raise his hand on a woman, if he was an opinion, then why was the crowd part of it for 3 days? Why does he have the card of the junior artist of the industry, if he does not believe in these things
 5
 Who gave him the right to such disgusting work
 6
 If one does not agree with anything, then he has the right to fast, to sit in peace, to talk, not to attack anyone without reason, even with the thought that he will survive
 7
 In a good education, it is never taught to commit violence for what you want to achieve
 8
 By attacking me, he felt that by attacking an actress, he could pursue his dirty thinking, i would like to urge every woman to accompany him to take action against him
 9
 i have not come here to promote any kind of dress, i just want to say that no one has the right to attack anyone with their dress and whether it is a man or a woman, everyone has their own accounts
 Have the right to choose their attire from
 10
 i have full faith in the law of my country that justice will be given to every girl with me who is the victim of such attacks
 11
 i would also like to appeal to the media that they should understand the pain of such girls, and support the girls with the rights of such attacks
 12
 i completed the shooting even after the attack, just to prove that every single girl who is watching me, should not just sit on any of the oppressions that are on her, live her head high

 i know that this cowardly person does not represent the youth of the country, because all the people who were around him opposed its atrocities, and no one supported it
 14
 i am thankful to my whole family, close friends, media people, fans, who are standing with me at such a time, and i want to assure that yes i am sad but not broken, i am pained but i am not weak i am injured, but i have become stronger
 15
 i am proud of the girls of Rohtak, i was in shock that i did not know what happened to me, i was still thinking as a human being at that time why he killed me? i am very scared, i have no right to tell anyone about my religion, i am proud that Farhan Akhtar carries forward his 'man' companion
 16
 There is a veil system in every religion, if the issue of clothing is so big, it can be talked about, it is not right to kill someone, it shows how his education has been initiated
 17
 Now i will think ten times before taking a photo with a fan, half my face is still in pain, please support everyone, please do not support wrong, live your life and let me live, i wish the above people should give right education

 It is being told that three students have committed suicide since December
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aatmahatya karne vaale chaatr kaa naam manjunath he or vah kanpur kaa rahane vaala he
 The special thing is that his father and sister have already died and he is now left with his mother

 After the alliance of Deoband, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi are going to campaign in West Uttar Pradesh today
 donon netaa aaj usee saharanpur loksabhaa kshetra se apane prachaar kaa aagaaj kar rahe hai, jahaan ravivaar ko sapa-basapa or areldi ke mahagathbandhan kii pehali saajha raily hui or usamen basapa supremeo mayawati ne khuleam saharanpur ke muslimon se vot na baantne kii apil karte hue congress ko khuli chunauti di
 In such a situation, when Rahul and Priyanka, who have adopted a soft attitude towards the alliance so far, will reach the land of Saharanpur, then how will they respond to Mayawati's Muslim card, it will also be interesting to see
 pashchim upi kii jin aath siton par pehle charan ke tahat 11 april ko matdaan ho rahaa he, unamem congress ko saharanpur main apni sthiti sabase majboot najar aa rahi he
 The reason for this is the 2014 election results, when despite the Modi wave, Congress candidate Imran Masood was just 65 thousand votes behind from bjp's winning candidate Raghav Lakhanpal
 darasal, saharanpur loksabhaa kshetra main kareeb 38 fisadi muslim hai, jin par congress kii ek baar phir najar he or bispi ko muslim vot bank ke bantane kaa khatra sata rahaa he, kyonki haji fajalurrahman ke rup main gathbandhan ne bhi muslim pratyaashee ko maidan main utaara he
 a similar situation is seen in the Bijnor Lok Sabha seat, where the Congress has fielded Nasimuddin Siddiqui, considered the big face of the politics of UP
 bijanour loksabhaa seat par bhi kareeb 38 fisadi muslim hai or yahaan se basapa ne maluk nagar ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 That is, as a Muslim candidate, Ekloute Nasimuddin Siddiqui is challenging
 yahi vajah he ki congress ko is seat par muslim votaron kaa samarthan milane kii ummid he or rahul va priyanka gandhi donon bijanour main bhi jansabha karne ja rahe hai
 Jyotiraditya Scindia will also be with rahul-priyanka, there will be another public meeting of both the leaders today (monday) on the Kairana Lok Sabha seat of the first phase
 jat or muslim bahulya kairana seat se congress ne purv saansad harendra malik ko utarkar donon samudaay ke maton ko saadhane kii ranneeti apanaai he
 However, how effective this strategy of the Congress is, is also a big question
 kyonki 2014 ke chunaav main pehle charan kii in sabhi 8 siton par bijepi ko jeet mili thi
 Whereas now the equation of the SP-BSP and RLD has changed together completely
 aise main musalmaan matadaataaon ke congress ko samarthan milane se bijepi ke jeetne kii jo ashanka devband kii raily se mayawati ne jataai he, kya vaisaa koi samarthan hasil karne main rahul va priyanka safal ho paaenge, iskaa jawaab milanaa abhi baaki he
 Let me tell you that Rahul Gandhi has been taking a soft stand against SP-BSP till now, saying that his fight is with BJP and the fight of alliance is also against BJP
 aise main ab jabaki mayawati ke khule taur par congress ko gherna shuru kar diya he to kya rahul kii ranneeti main koi badlaav dekhne ko milegaa, ye bhi bada sawaal he

 Sri Lanka took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series on Thursday, defeating India by 10 wickets in the historic first match that left Muttiah Muralitharan's magical figure of 800 wickets and departed from Test cricket
 bharat ke puchhlle ballebaajon ne muralidharan ko 800wein wicket ke liye lanbaa intjaar karavaaya lekin aakhir main yah diggaj aaf spinner pragyan ojha ko apane chahete kshetrarakshak mahela jayavardhane ke haathon kaich karakar cricket itihaas main nayaa adhyay jodne main safal rahaa
 The Sri Lankan team also kept their promise of a memorable farewell to Muralitharan

 Tillakaratne Dilshan, batting in a stormy style, scored an unbeaten 68 off 47 balls while Taranga Paranavitana remained unbeaten on 23 runs
 dilashaan ne harbhajan ko chakka lagaakar team ko jeet tak pahunchaaya
 However, this match will be remembered for Muralitharan's last Test, his prodigious achievement and Sri Lanka's victory but it will also refer to the battling of India's lower order, especially Ishant Sharma, who scored an unbeaten 31 and batted at number four
 Be the batsman who played more than 100 balls
 bharat yadi pari kii haar se batch paaya to isamen vivies lakshmana kaa bhi ahm yogadan rahaa jinhone 69 ran banaaye tathaa ishanth ke saath nauven ripet naunve wicket ke liye 68 ran kii saajhedaari kii jo is maidan par nayaa ricard he

 Malinga showed the charisma of LBW by taking five wickets in the innings for the third time
 unke kul viketon kii sankhya ab 98 ho gayi he
 After this, Ishant also did not let the Sri Lankan bowlers take rest with Laxman
 darshak hi nahin balki muralidharan ke mata pita, patni or srilanka ke raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe or kai purv or vartmaan khilaadi bhi unke 800wein wicket ke liye dua karte rahe
 By lunch time there were only two wickets left
 lakshmana lunch ke baad durbhagyapurna tareeke se ran out ho gayi
 He hit five fours in his innings
 ab muralidharan ke paas nayaa mukaam hasil karne ke liye aakhri mauka tha lekin lakshmana kaa sthaan lene ke liye aaye ojha or ishanth ne agle 15 over tak srilankai gendbaajon ko pareshaan kiya
 Finally that clock also arrived
 ojha ne unki gend ko modana chaha lekin vah pehali slip main jayavardhane ke paas chali gayi jinhone is gendbaaj kii gendon main ricard 77 kaich lapke hai
 With this, firecrackers were released in the stadium and spectators danced in joy
 muralidharan ko sirf unheen ke saathiyon ne nahin balki bharatiyon ne bhi badhai di
 Muralitharan took the ball from the umpire and then rushed to the dressing room, accepting the audience's greetings
 ab unke naam par 133 test match main 22
 800 wickets are recorded at an average of 72, which will always be a challenge for the bowlers of the world

 Chinese President Xi Jinping has reached Chennai on a visit to India
 pradhanmantri modi or raashtrapati chinafing ke bich baatcheet ke liye chennai se 40 kimi dur maamllapuram chunaa gaya
 Earlier, Xi Chinfing came to Ahmedabad
 is daure ko anaupchaarik mana ja rahaa he
 Grand preparations have been made to welcome the President of China
 maamllapuram yani mahabalipuram main chah ghante tak donon saath rahenge
 There is no public agenda for this meeting
 na hi koi bayaan aayega
 So what will happen, what will happen, nothing concrete has come to the fore right now
 jo bhi saamne he vah mahabalipuram kii bhavyata or uskaa shandaar itihaas or uski prishthbhumi main asia ke do prabhaavshaalee mulkon ke pramukhon kaa sahajata ke saath tahalnaa
 There is talk that President Xi Chinfing's fleet was so large that it needed a large runway to land which was not in any other city
 chennai airport par aise jahaazon ko utaarne kii kshamta thi isliye yah jagah uske hisse aayaa
 56 km from Chennai lies Mahabalipuram on the banks of the Bay of Bengal which was called Mamallapuram
 yah naam pallav raja narsimhavarman pratham ke naam par padaa jinhen mahaan yoddha kaha jaataa tha
 During the reign of the Pallava king, the skill of making a single rock cut artwork was known as Dravidian architecture
 achaanak se aap chhathi or saatvin sadi ke iraadon ke saamne pate hai
 Today's technology appears to be modest in front of it
 pradhanmantri ne khud raashtrapati chinafing ko vishnu mandir, arjuna penence le jaakar dikhaaya
 Prime Minister Modi wore vest
 yah lungi jaisaa he lekin kaha jaataa veshti he
 You may remember that when President Xi Chinfing came in 2014, he was taken to Ahmedabad
 uske baad doklam vivaad hua lekin yah bhi yaad rakhie ki is saal china ne masood azhar ko global aatanki ghoshit karne main aadchan nahin daali thi
 Whereas previously he had done three times
 chunki baatcheet anaupchaarik he or agenda saarvajanik nahin hai isliye philhal focus kaaryakramon kii bhavyata par he or unase judane vaale aitihaasik or vartanaam sanyogon par he
 By the time the outcome of the conference reaches the common people, its grandeur will have made its place
 shanivaar ko donon netaaon ke bich 40 minute kii mulaakaat hogi lekin koi bayaan jari nahin hoga
 After that, President Xi will go to Nepal
 donon deshon kii taraf se baar baar kaha ja chukaa he ki pradhanmantri modi or raashtrapati shi chinafing kii mulaakaat ranneetik he
 To further improve bilateral relations
 anaupchaarik rup se mukt hokar baatcheet ke alag nattejey hote hai
 There is talk of positive progress in the border dispute between India and China
 zarur kashmir kii charchaa he lekin asia ke do netaa mil rahe hai to kya ve syria par turki ke hamale kii baat kar rahe hai, honkong main ho rahe andolan par baat kar rahe hai, hamen isaki jaankaree nahin he
 In this context, it is unlikely that President Jinping will refer to Kashmir
 beshak kashmir par china ke bayaan ne pakistan kaa hausala badhaayaa he lekin bharat ne bhi har bayaan ke baad kadaa etraz jataane main koi sankoch nahin kiya
 Whether it is the statement of China in the United Nations Conference or the Chinese Ambassador in Pakistan said that China is with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir
 bharat ne turant etraz jataayaa
 When Imran Khan went to Beijing on Wednesday in a joint statement between Pakistan and China, when China said that China is keeping a close watch on the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir kii samasya kaa samaadhaan sanyukt raashtra ke charter ke anusaar hona chahie
 China opposes any unilateral action in such a complex situation
 is vivaad kaa nipataara barabari or sammaan ke saath hona chahie
 Apparently India did not like it and it was clearly stated that a country like China knows the situation of India
 use bharat ke aantarik maamalon main dakhal nahin dena chahie
 It is written in the Chinese media that bilateral interests will remain strong
 donon netaaon ke vyaktigat sambandhon main or pragadhata aegi
 The South China Morning Post has written that China is extending its hand towards Pakistan but is moving towards India
 pakistan kaa saath dene ke baad bhi china bharat ke saath apane sambandhon ko saamaanya karnaa chahta he
 China Daily has written that during the meeting, the two will take bilateral relations to the next level
 donon deshon ke hiton par hi charchaa hogi
 The india-china relationship should be seen from the perspective of trade, apart from the border dispute and Kashmir
 aakhir kyon bharat main china se aayaat badhata ja rahaa he or bharat se china main niryaat ghatata hi ja rahaa he yaa nahin bad paa rahaa he
 This situation is called trade deficit
 bharat or china ke bich 100 arab dollars kaa vyapaar pahunchane vaala he
 95 last year
 5 arab dollar ho gaya tha
 Now look at this figure from the point of view of trade deficit
 duniya ke alag-alag deshon ke saath bharat kaa kul vyapaar ghaataa 105 arab dollar kaa he
 Of this, only China has a deficit of $ 53 billion
 2013-14 main bharat kaa china ke saath vyapaar ghaataa 36 arab dollar kaa tha
 The trade deficit widened to $ 53 billion in 2018-19
 china se aayaat badhata hi ja rahaa he yani bharat ke bazaar chini maal se bhare hai
 Jobs are being created in China
 china daawa karata he ki bharat main 1000 chini companiyaan khul gai hai
 There is an investment of 8 billion dollars and two lakh people got work
 niti ayog kii report 2017 kii he
 This report states that in 2010 India signed a Free Trade Agreement with ASEAN countries and China
 us vakt bharat kaa vyapaar sarplus tha
 We used to export 53 billion to China
 ab wo ulta ho gaya
 China is exporting
 to bharat or china ke bich is sambandh se bharat ko kya mila
 China's trade relations with Bangladesh are improving
 china ne bangladesh ko newclear power plant or prakritik gas sansadhano ko viksit karne kii peshkash kii he
 Another issue is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RECP) agreement between India and China
 yah ek nayaa kshetreey morcha he
 Under this, the duty of import and export will be greatly reduced or completely abolished
 china is deal ko jaldi karnaa chahta he kyonki vah america ke saath vyapaarik jhagade se pareshaan he
 But there is tension in India's markets that if it is recognized that the market of dairy, steel and textile will weaken
 isliye deyari udyog ke logon ne sarkaar se sangrakshan kii maang kii he
 You know that India's textile industry has been sitting around due to cheap apparel from Bangladesh
 agar aayaat shulk or kam hua to musiibat badhegi
 On the other hand, other sectors of India want the import duty on steel to be reduced so that they get cheaper steel
 swadeshi jaagran manch ne aaraiseepi ke khilaaf das dinon ke andolan kaa elaan kiya he
 If the RECP agreement is reached, the government will not be able to strengthen the manufacturing and farming sector
 retail vyapaar ke sangh ke netaa praveen khandelwal kehete hai ki china se sasta maal aayaa to nuksaan badhegaa
 This concern of the business class is not common and cannot be ignored
 swadeshi jaagran manch kaa virodh sarkaar ko kitna chintit karegaa, is par lekar zyaada maathapai karne kii zarurat nahin he
 For the time being in the evening in the Bay of Bengal, the anxieties of the business class must be flying like Kapoor behind the grandeur of these cultural programs
 udyog mantri piyush goyal isi masale ko lekar bangkok main hai
 He says that if India stays out of this new faction then it will be isolated
 saal ke ant tak is kshetreey samjhaute par dastakhat hoga
 40 percent of the world's GDP will come
 bharat ne abhi tak yahi kaha ki vah apni chintaaon ko mahatv detaa he
 Sectors like dairy should be excluded
 bharat kii arthvyavastha is vakt sankat se guzar rahi he
 India's manufacturing sector is faltering
 pichley saadhe paanch saal main is sector se koi shandaar khabar to nahin ai he
 Whose side will this cultural event celebrate? bharat ke paksh main yaa china ke paksh main
 It will be known from the Banking meeting next month that the conditions on which India signs RECP
 is samjhaute par bharat kii sabase badi chintaa vyapaar ghate ke badhane tathaa gharelu udyog dhandhon ke nuksaan ko lekar he
 India imports more than exports from the 11 countries involved in the agreement, including China, South Korea and Australia, ie the balance of trade is in favor of these countries
 china ke saath hamaara ghaataa to 55-60 arab dollar salanaa ke hisaab main he
 According to the proposal of the agreement, India will have to remove or reduce import duty on 74 to 80 percent of imports from China, 86 percent from Australia and New Zealand and 80 percent of goods from Japan, South Korea and ASEAN countries
 iske liye alag-alag vastuon ke liye paanch se pachchis saal kii avadhi tay kii gayi he
 Although there is a provision for India in the proposals that it can increase the tariffs to protect its domestic industry in the event of excessive imports of any goods, but this is not easy to do
 mukt vyapaar kii sthiti main kai vastuon ke maamle main hamaare udyogon ko gunvattta or mulya ko lekar kathor pratispardhaa karne kii naubat bhi aa sakati he
 The news on Kashmir has started changing
 indian express ne haal hi main report kii thi ki vahaan prashasan ab saamaanya he ki jagah sab kuch niyantran main he kii bhashaa bolne laga he
 The reports of Express KP Vaidyanathan Iyer and Adil Akhzar show that the language of administration is changing
 5 agast ko anuchhed 370 hataane ke faisle ke baad pratirodh kii jagah logon ne khud par karfu odh liya he
 They have become silent
 unki chuppi prashasan ko pareshaan karne lagi he
 The Express report states that the administration is now beginning to read this silence in another way
 use lagata he ki kahin yah chuppi ulta na pad jaae
 The government recently took several steps
 paryatakon se pratibandh hataaya, faruk abdulla se unki party ke netaaon ko milane diya gaya
 Even after this, people are not saying anything
 block deveopment council ke chunaav kaa bijepi chhod baaki dalon ne bahishkaar kiya he
 But the posts of 45 percent sarpanch and 61 percent panch wards are vacant
 aisi sthiti main is chunaav kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 The Express has written this report after talking to dozens of officials
 sabane of record baatcheet kii he
 You can also read the report
 adhikariyon ne is report main kaha he ki koi badi ghatana nahin hui he iskaa matlab halaat saamaanya nahin hai
 This is not the Kashmir that they knew where there was uproar even when the public got up
 aakhir is chuppi ko kaise padhaa jaae
 In this context, an advertisement by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir is necessary
 greater kashmir main chape is vigyaapan kii bhashaa express kii report main likhi gai baton ko sahi tehraati he
 This advertisement is in English and printed on the front page, which is translated as thick
 
 
 'dukaane band hai
 No use of public transport, who benefits? Are we going to surrender to terrorism? ' Think is written in big letters
 yani sochie
 It is further written that for 70 years the people of Jammu and Kashmir have been misled
 hinsa or aatank ke chakra main fansaa rahaa
 The separatists continued to send their children to study abroad, while the children here were stuck in stone-pelting and strike
 aaj phir se aatankwaadi vahi tarika apana rahe hai
 Will we be afraid of them? aaj ham chauraahey par hai
 Will we let the old ways of fear and violence affect ourselves? We have to take a decision
 kya ham chand postaron or dhamkiyon se dar jaaenge
 Not starting a business, not living a legal life? this is our house
 darana hi kyon? neeche jammu or kashmir sarkaar likhaa he
 After two months, this kind of advertisement is saying something which is probably written in the report of Express
 express kashmir ghati kii chuppi ko kisi or tareeke se pard rahaa he
 That is, everything is not normal
 sarkaar is chuppi ko aatankwaadiyon ke dar ke rup main pard rahi he, dekh rahi he
 But returning from there, the Citizen Report of Revathi Lawal, Brainley d'souza, Shabnam Hashmi and Anirudh Kala is reading this silence in another way
 inkaa kahana he ki abhi tak sarkaar ko sunaane ke liye dhamaake hue, goliyaan chalin, bandook uthaae gaye, jail gaye, janaaze main gaye, magar is baar jab anuchhed 370 hataa to logon ko chuppi ke rup main ek nayaa hathiyaar mil gaya
 He has written that do not think that something too big will happen
 log jab subah ke vakt dukaanon par aate hai, dukaane khul rahi hai to phir dopaher main vahi dukaane band kyon nazar aati hai
 It should be thought over
 kya yah kisi kism kii civil nafarmani he

 ek rajasthani ke ghar main jab koi mehmaan aata he, to use puri mehmaannawaaji ke saath bakaayade paaramparik dhang se khaanaa parosa jaataa he
 The principle of self-service or self-serving food is considered here and it is not part of the culture and courtesy of Rajasthanis
 vivaah samarohon main bhi vadhoo paksh ke log is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhte hai ki duulhe or baratiyon ko paaramparik tareeke se thaaliyon main khaanaa parosa jaae or is bhoj ko sajjangot kaha jaataa he
 The cooking style adopted in Rajasthan is decided on the natural climatic conditions of this desert region
 rajasthan main pani kii or isliye hari subjiyon kii badi kami he or yahaan kii paak kala iske pratikul asar main hi viksit hui he
 In the desert belt of Rajasthan, people still use more number of milk, buttermilk and butter in cooking so that water has to be used less and less
 rajasthani log chatniyon ke bade shaukeen hai
 Chutneys of various spices like coriander, turmeric, garlic and mint are made here
 rajasthan ke tamaam vyajanon main daal-baati-chuurma shaayad sabase zyada mashhoor he
 In fact, as you travel from one part of the state to another, you will find that every area has some unique feature and it is also reflected in the food here
 ab jab shahari jivan style rajasthan ke zyaadaatar hisson main apane pair pasaar rahi he, fast food, fine dining or khaanaa khaane kii modern jagahon ko ubharate hue dekha ja saktaa he
 The local residents here may be enjoying modern mines, but they have a deep urge to return to their traditional mines
 yah is baat se bhi sabit hota he ki aadhunik restaraanon or jagahon par bhi ham paramparaagat rajasthani khaane parose jate dekhte hai
 i would rather say that these new places have made it possible for tourists to enjoy Rajasthani cuisine in a comfortable atmosphere
 ek to sthaneey logon main apane paaramparik bhojan ke prati kaayam prem or phir desi-videshi sailaaniyon ke rajasthani bhojan ke prati aakarshan kii vajah se nae sthapit hue restaraan main bhi paaramparik bhojan parose jate hai
 There are many famous restaurants in different cities of Rajasthan
 masalan agar ham jaipur ko len, to yahaan handi or spice court jaise restaraan hai, jo paaramparik swaad ke saath-saath aadhunik swaad uplabdh karaane main maahir hai
 Non-veg food like Handi Chicken, Handi Meat and Lal Mas served at Handi Restaurant are also very tasty
 sabase acchhee baat he ki in restaraan main khate hue aapako rajasthani samskruti kaa bhi bhaan hota he
 Many restaurants have different types of events ranging from Rajasthani song and music
 vahiin udaipur kaa amarai restaraan or upare bhi kaaphi mashhoor restaraan hai
 Another specialty of these restaurants is that along with the delicious food, one can also get a charming view of the City Palace and the lakes
 yani sohe par suhaaga
 At the same time, gypsy and Indic restaurants are also very famous in Jodhpur
 gypsy jahaan shaakaahaari bhojan ke liye pasandida jagah he to indi maansaahaari bhojan ke liye
 Restaurants in Rajasthan are also known for their hospitality and people prefer to go there due to friendly behavior
 jaahir he, rajasthan main khanpan kii vividh paramparaon ko yahaan ke restaraan kaayam kiye hue hai

 Prior to the announcement of election dates, India today-axis My India conducted an opinion poll, which shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party is once again proving right to save its stronghold Gujarat
 pichley kuch samay se bhale hi rajya main GST, notebandi ko lekar vyapaariyon main badi bechaini ke baavjood, patidaar-obisi-thakor-daliton ke andolan ho rahe hon, lekin logon kaa bharosa ab bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi par he
 According to opinion poll conducted for 182 assembly seats, BJP is going to win the victory of 115 to 125 seats
 gujarat kii mukhya vipakshi party congress ke khate main 57 se 65 siten aati dikh rahi hai
 Opposition is not a big threat! However, if you look at all aspects of the survey, then the Narendra modi-amit Shah duo does not have much danger in their home state from the Congress or the three young Patidar leaders
 bhale hi in sabhi kii reliyon main bheed umad rahi ho yaa phir vipaksh lagaataar bijepi par nishaanaa saadh rahaa ho
 Who votes in Gujarat? (first position) BJP: 48% Congress + Alpesh Thakor + Jignesh Mevani: 38% Hardik-backed party: 2% Other (vaghela-backed party + AAP): 12% How many seats in Gujarat? (first position, total seats-182) Congress + Alpesh Thakor + Jignesh Mevani: 57-65 seatsbjp: 115-125 seatshardik-backed party: 0 seatsother (vaghela-backed party + AAP): 0-3 Seetakya will be second position? If Hardik Patel What will be the trend when we officially declare our support for the Congress? exis maai india ke polsters ke mutabik agar hardik khule taur par congress ke samarthan kaa elaan karte hai to is party kaa vot share 38% se badhkar 40% ho saktaa he
 In such a scenario, the Congress could benefit from 5 to 10 more seats
 itnaa hi nuksaan bijepi ko seat sankhya main ho saktaa he
 Modi himself in the way of Modi! But if there can be any obstacle in Narendra Modi's victory in Gujarat, then it is Narendra Modi himself
 ji, survey ke dauraan log modi sarkaar ke kai faislon se log naakhush dikhaai die hai
 Which can become a threat to BJP in elections
 modi sarkaar ke notebandi or jiesti ke faisle se kaaphi naakhush dikhaai die
 What do people say about GST? - 51% people are dissatisfied with GST
 - 38 fisadi log jiesti se santusht hai
 - 11 percent people did not give their opinion on GST
 notebandi se kya laabh mila?- 44 fisadi logon ne kaha haa- 33 fisadi logon ne kaha naa- 3 fisadi logon ne koi vichaar nahin rakhaabijepi sarkaar se kitne santusht hai gujarat ke kisaan?piem modi lagbhag har bhaashan main kehete hai ki unka lakshya kisaanon kii aay ko 2022 tak doguna karne kaa he
 But according to the survey, only the farmers of Gujarat are not satisfied with the BJP government
 - santusht kisaan- 38%- asantusht kisaan- 49%- behad gussa- 7%- zyada gussa nahin- 2%- jaanate nahin- 4%kya hai gujarat ke sabase bade mudde?vitt mantri arun jetali ne mangalvaar ko hi press conference kar sarkaar kii tarif kii
 Jaitley said that the government has controlled inflation
 lekin survey kii maane, to gujarat main chunaav kaa sabase bada mudda hi mahangaai he
 That is, people are troubled by rising inflation, another big issue is employment

 haal hi main IIT or dilli uniwarsity ne apane chaatro ko salikedaar kapade pahanane kaa farmaan jari kiya tha, jo soshal media par bahes kaa mudda bad gaya tha
 After going viral on social media, IIT and DU were seen giving their clarification
 DU hua 'sanskari', hostel ke students ko proper dress pahanane kaa farmatiob punjab ke sarkari skulon main teachers ko 'sanskari kapade' pahanane kaa farmaan jari kiya gaya he
 The decree states that teachers should not wear jeans-tops, shiny and flamboyant clothes to the school, which affects students studying in the school
 punjab ke diarector for public instrection (DPI) ne sabhi distric ajukeshan officer or skulon ke principal ko ek patr likhakar yah sunishchit karne ko kaha he ki skool main shikshak decent kapade hi pahanakar aaen
 Actually, this step has been taken after the parents' complaint
 sarkari skulon main padhane vaale chaatro ke mata-pita kaa kahana he ki skool main padhane vaale teachers khaastaur se mahila teachers ke uttejk, chamakdaar or fashneble par roak lagaaya janaa chahie
 Now, students will do legal studies in school
 The order states that teachers in government schools, especially ladies teachers, do duty in flashy dresses
 kai teachers genes-top jaise kai uksaau, fashneble dress pahanakar skool kii duty par aati hai, jiskaa vidhyaarthiyon par asar padataa he
 Teachers are upset after this order
 ek akhbaar main prakashit khabar ke anusaar tesearch kaa kahana he ki unhen apni pasand ke kapade pahanane kii aazaadee milani chahie
 If a teacher wants to wear jeans or other western clothes, then there is no harm in that
 IIT-K ke professor kaa daawa, do dashak baad farvari main chalegi lu
 
 
 At the same time, some women teachers say that there is a lack of logic in this order
 kyonki adhikansh teachers suut pahanakar skool aati hai, bas kuch hi kabhi kabhaar genes pahanakar aati hai
 Higher authorities should focus more on improving the quality of education and not on issuing instructions that are non-essential

 everyone's favorite Divyanka Tripathi is once again trolling on social media
 jisaki vajah he sho main unka mekaover
 Where she will be seen in the Haryanvi maid's getup
 ek troller ne actress ke mekaover ko dayaneey or bakawaas qaraar diya he
 Whose Divyanka responded in her own way and silenced the troller
 darasal, is nae hariyaanvi luk ke liye divyanka ke chehre ke rang ko dark kiya gaya he
 She looks black as Haryanvi Made
 jise loar class ke logon kaa apmaan kaha ja rahaa he
 TV actress Divyanka slaps her husband, but
 
 
 ek troller ne likhaa, ek tivi serial ke liye aapane apane rang ko kaala kiya
 It is not wrong to be black but it is ridiculous to do so
 jab aapane sho main videshi kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tab to aapane mechap kam nahin kiya
 But for a maid's character, is it fair to paint the face black? This is evidence of duplicity

 Do you think black is useless? Don't you think before writing something? Let me know before writing anything
 pehle sho kaa trek dekhen, use samajhen, sammaan karen
 Then write something

 BJP general secretary added to the resignation of IAS officers: Left connection: The officers gave resignation due to the good relations with the left
 Within three months, the resignation of three IAS officers was targeted by the Bharatiya Janata Party's national general secretary (organization) BL Santosh
 teenon iees afasaron kaa left conection jodate hue vichaardhaara se madhur sambandh bataae hai 
 BL Santosh indicated in a tweet that the three officers did not digest the ideology with full mandate, hence he quit the job
 bijepi ke rashtriya mahaamantri biel santosh ne kaha, "teen iees afasar apane padon se sirf isliye istipha de dete hai kyonki ek or vichaar prakriya desh main purna janadesh ke saath chal rahi he
 From this one can imagine the intolerance of the left-liberal system with whom they had a cordial relationship
 desh aapako puri tarah samajhataa he"3 IAS Officers resign from their positions just because a thought process other than that they were infected with moves on in the country with full mandate
 Imagine the intolerance of left, liberal ecosystem with whom they had cozy relationship

 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that India has adopted diversity and when Indians go abroad, all of them are known as Hindus
 unhone kaha, 'ham sabhi hindu hai
 There is diversity in the country, but when we go out of India, people (there) call us Hindus
 'tippaniyan Mohan Bhagwat while addressing a public meeting in the tribal-dominated Nandurbar district of North Maharashtra said, "there is no country in the world today whose basic thinking is that all people are its own
" bharat ekmaatr aisa desh he jo aisa sochataa he
 'he said,' Our culture has its roots in valleys, forests and agriculture
 jab tak bhagwaan ram ayodhya ke mahal main the, unke paas ravan ko maarane kii shakti nahin thi
 Ravana was killed by the powers that Rama gained by wandering in the jungles and valleys
 ' The RSS chief said about India's religious diversity, that all religions are acceptable here
 unhone kaha, 'ham ek aise desh ke vaasi hai, jahaan ham vibhinn roopon main ishwar kii aradhana karte hai
 The Hindu is the one who recognizes that God
 ham ek duusare ke matbhedon kaa sammaan karte hai
 ' mohan bhagwat ne uttar maharashtra ke adivasee bahul nandurbaar jile main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'duniya main aaj aisa koi desh nahin he, jisaki buniyadi soch yah ho ki sabhi log uske apane hai
 India is the only country that thinks so
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamaari samskruti kii jaden ghaatiyon, wanon or krishi main he

 ' kolkata ke eden gardens main hone vaale world tii20 ke final main ravivaar ko jab westeindies or england bhidenge to kris gail or jo root par sabaki nigahen hongi
 In the tournament, when the two teams collided the last time, Gayle single-handedly defeated England
 gail ke is dhuandhar shatak se bikhare england ko root ne south africa ke khilaaf 44 gendon main 83 ranon kii pari khelkar sambhala
 It is the result of the enthusiasm in the British after chasing 230 runs on the basis of the route that today this team is going to face the Windies in the final
 is match main jahaan angrej badla lene utrenge vahiin carabian team chaahegi ki wo group-10 ke match main mili jeet ko doharaakar world tii20 kaa khitaab apane naam kar sake
 Know the five factors of this match before the match, which will determine the result of this match to a large extent
 1
 Whether Alex hales-jason Roy's opening England first batting or chasing a target, the bat of these two will largely indicate the outcome of the match in the first 6 overs
 helles or roy aise batsman hai jinhen jamane ke liye bahut si genden nahin chahie or naa hi ye kisi gendbaaj se darate hai
 If the West Indies do not get rid of these batsmen who have the ability to turn the match towards their team in the first 6 overs, then the World T20 trophy could be a far cry for Sammy
 2
 Joe root-jose Butler's middle order Hurricane Joe Root is considered to be one of the best batsmen in the current cricketing world
 root ne apni batting se is baat ko aksar pruv bhi kiya he
 Root, batting in the middle order, specializes in both recovering the team from a bad start and capitalizing on the team's good start
 root ne apni kamaal kii batting ke dam par pehla match haarane ke baad apni team ko south africa ke khilaaf 230 ranon kaa torget chej karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Due to batting in the middle order, wicketkeeper batsman Jos Buttler, often seen at the other end along the route, is known for his batting batting
 butler vanade main england ke liye sabase tej shatak banane kaa record apane naam rakhte hai
 Butler scored 116 runs off just 52 balls on 20 November 2015 against Pakistan in Dubai
 us pari main butler ne mahaj 46 gendon par shatak thonk kar apane hi puraane record main sudhaar kiya tha

 darren saimi or andre rasel kaa oleround khempani captaini main westeindies ko 2012 kaa world tii20 jitaane vaale darren saimi ko abhi tak is toornament main apni team ke achche pradarshan ke chalate batting or bowling kam hi kerani padi he
 But, having their day in both these departments, they can show stars to good teams in the day
 bharat ke khilaaf semifinal match main mahaj 20 gendon par 43 ranon kii pari khilne vaale andre rasel is formet main duusari tiimon ke liye bada khatra hai
 Apart from West Indies leading wicket takers in this tournament, Russell is also the batsman who comes in any order and has the ability to change the result of the match in 10-20 balls

 Marlon samuels-lendl Simmons battingmerlan Samuels is yet to make a big score in this tournament
 dabaav main aksar nikharkar saamne aane vaale sampuls kaam chalau gendbaaji bhi kar lete hai
 He made the West Indies T20 champions for the first time in 2012
 duusari taraf andre flechar kii jagah aanan-fanan main bulaae gaye landal simons ne apane pehle hi match main 52 gendon main 82 ranon kii pari khelkar sabit kar diya ki wo kitne khatarnaak hai
 Another dangerous thing with these two is that they come at number three and fourth in the batting order, which means that there are more chances of batting with both of them, which is definitely a big headache for the other team

 The opening of Chris Gayle and Johnson Charles need not say much about Pairgel's batting
 puri duniya jaanati he ki gail tii20 main kya kar sakate hai
 Gayle is one of the few batsmen to be held at the crease just because the front captain breathes
 shuru main inkaa footwork jarur kharaab rahata he lekin agar ye shuru ke 2-4 over nikaal le jaaen to phir ye apni marji se boundry bhi jadte hai or apni marji se hi out bhi hote hai
 On the other hand, given the amazing batting that Johnson Charles did after Gayle's early dismissal against India, they are definitely a big threat for England

 Private security agencies that provide logistics services to banks have a shortage of armed staff
 isi vajah se vaisaa andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he
 According to an industry estimate, the number of armed guards in cash handling agencies has come down to one-third from 6 months ago, affecting logistics operations
 iske alaava navaratri, dashahra or diwali jaise tyoharon kii vajah se bhi guard chuttee par ja sakate hai
 Industry officials say that at present, most atms are cashing in every fifth day, while atms are usually poured in every other day
 logisticks company ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘atm main nakadi kii kami ho sakati he
 There is a shortage of security guards in various companies
 isse atm main nakadi daalane kii avadhi 5 din ho gai he
 However, a public sector bank official said that bank atms are taking steps to infuse additional cash in view of the festive season
 cash logisticks association ke anusaar, bainkon kii ore se har din atm main 15,000 karod rupee kii nakadi daali ja rahi he
 The association said that one of the reasons for the lack of armed security guards is that the police in many states have objected to the issue
 police kaa kahana he ki nijee hathiyaar license kaa istemaal kanoon main bataae gaye tareeke ke alaava duusari jagah kahin nahin ho saktaa
 This has led to a shortage of staff in cash logistics firms, as they do not get a formal license for weapons for cash maintenance

 romash sharma ne vah plot jaya bachchan ko transfar kar diya
 The reason he did this is that Jaya Bachchan is the director of his company
 uske baad praadhikaran ne vah plot jaya bachchan ko aavantit kar diya
 But Jaya Bachchan did not get the plot registered in her name
 unhen 5 baar notice bheje gaye, lekin unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 Now the authority has canceled the allocation of this plot
 agar iske baad jaya bachchan ise lenaa chahengi to un par 36 lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 Only by paying this amount, she will be able to register the plot in her name
 iske alaava unhen vartmaan cirkil rate kaa 10 pratishat bhi dena hoga jo kareeb 35 lakh rupee banataa he
 Now it has to be seen whether Jaya Bachchan shows interest in registering her name on that plot
 sabhi companiyaan badha rahi hai tarriff ratedeta bhi ho jayega agle maheene se mahangaa
 India currently has the cheapest data compared to other countries
 Reliance Jio ke aane ke baad data rate main teji se giravat hui or ab data kaaphi sasta ho chukaa he
 But after Reliance Jio entered the industry, only data and calling became cheap, it is not only this but other telecom companies also started a bad tour
 airsel, telenor, aar com jaisi companiyaan khatm ho gayi, jabaki idia or vodaphone kaa marjar ho gaya
 Now it is also reported that Vodafone can consolidate its business from India
 airtel ke bhi customers gire hai
 But now cheap data is going to be expensive
 airtel, vodaphone or reliance jeeyo- in teenon badi telecom companiyon ne disambar se apane sabhi tarriff badhaane kaa elaan kar diya he
 There will be both prepaid and postpaid users
 haalanki ab tak in companiyon ne nae plance jari nahin kiye hai
 The special thing is that now along with calling, data will also be expensive
 vodaphone idia ko duusari timahi main ab tak kaa sabase bada ghaataa hua he
 Not only this, 25 of the company in the month of September
 7 lakh customers kam ho gaye hai
 Experts believe that companies will increase their tariff prices rapidly due to the continuing losses
 haalanki in teenon companiyon ne tarriff rate badhaane ke peeche jo vajah bataai he wo AGR he
 An amount of 94 thousand crore rupees is to be paid by all telecom service providers to the government as AGR
 is raashi main aadhe se zyada vodaphone idia ke hisse main aata he
 Recently Reliance Jio has announced to take money on non-jio calling citing IUC
 iske liye company ne nae packs launch kar die hai
 Behind this, Reliance Jio argued that TRAI had said that the IUC charge would be abolished, but this has not been done
 kya kahana he telecom companiyon kaa?iuc ko lekar airtel or vodaphone idia kii raay relaaysan jeeyo se bilkul alag he
 Both these companies have said that the IUC that TRAI charges is still less than the industry standard
 in companiyon kaa kahana he ki is vajah se bhi telecom industry kii haalat is vakt khasta ho rahi he
 Overall, these companies say that the IUC charge should be increased so that the industry can be revived
 BSNL kii baat karen to is sarkari telecom company kii haalat bad se badtar hoti ja rahi he
 According to media reports, preparations are on to sell BSNL
 karmchaariyon kii chatni kaaphi pehle se shuru ho chuki he
 If the government does not pay the expenditure of Rs 20 thousand crores, then maybe 1 lakh employees of BSNL can hang the sword of unemployment
 ek report ke mutabik pending pement kii vajah se puure system par asar pad rahaa he
 From December 1, tariff rates will be revised; From December 1, all telecom companies in India will have tariff rate revisions
 isamen colling se lekar data tak mahange kiye jaaenge
 Although at one time the companies will not give a huge burden to the customers, but the kind of crisis going on in the telecom sector, it seems that in the coming times, companies can increase the tariff rate again
 aasaan shabdon main kahen to ab rivival ke liye companiyaan sarkaar se ummid laga kar baithi hai
 The negotiations that were going on between the telecom companies and the government regarding AGR
 haalanki supreme court ne sarkaar ke hit main faisla lete hue companiyon ko AGR chukaane kaa aadesh diya he jo 1 lakh karod rupee se zyada kaa he

 chhattisgarh ke bilaspur jila prashasan ne jati pramaan patr maamle main purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ke khilaaf praathmiki darj karai he
 Bilaspur district Superintendent of Police Prashant Aggarwal said that a case was filed against Jogi at the Civil Lines police station in the city late on Thursday
 police adheekshak ne bataaya ki bilaspur colector kii ore se tehseeldaar tii aar bharadwaj ne jogi ke khilaaf maamla darj karaayaa he
 The district administration had asked the police to file a case against Jogi under Section 10 (1) of Chhattisgarh Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (regulation of Certification of Social Status) Act 2013
 iske baad jogi ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya gaya
 The police officer said that the matter is being investigated and no arrests have been made so far in this regard
 chhattisgarh ke pratham mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii jati kaa pataa lagane ke liye bani ucch stareey pramanikaran chaanbin samiti ne is maheene kii 23 taarikh ko jari kiye gaye aadesh main jogi ke kanvar adivasee hone ke pramaan patr ko khaarij kar diya he
 The committee authorized the Collector of Bilaspur district for necessary action in this regard after which a case has been registered against Jogi
 idhar ajit jogi ke putr amit jogi ne kaha he ki rajya sarkaar badale kii bhaavana se karrwai kar rahi he
 He alleged that action is being taken against the leaders of the opposition party at the behest of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, not according to the law in the state
 jogi ne kaha ki vah is maamle ko lekar adaalat jaaenge
 The controversy over the caste of former Chief Minister Jogi in Chhattisgarh is almost two decades old
 varsh 2001 main bhartiya janata party ke netaa sant kumaar netaam ne rashtriya anusuchit jati janajati ayog se jogi kii jati ko lekar shikaayat kii thi
 According to Netam, Jogi has described himself as a tribal on the basis of fake certificates
 vahiin is maamle ko lekar bhaajapa ke varisht adivasee netaa or vartmaan main rashtriya anusuchit janajati ayog ke adhyaksh nand kumaar saay ne adaalat main pariwaad daayar kiya tha
 Later, the case went to the Supreme Court and in 2011, the court directed the state government to form a high-powered committee to investigate caste and give its verdict
 tab raman singh sarkaar ne aadim jati tathaa anusuchit jati vikaas vibhaag kii vishesh sachiv rina babasaheb kangaale kii adhyakshata main jati pramaan patr ucchstareey chaanbin samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The investigation committee did not find the caste certificates related to Kanwar Scheduled Tribes issued to Jogi to be legal
 iske falswaroop jogi ke jati pramaan patron ko june 2017 main nirast kar diya gaya tha
 Jogi filed a writ petition in the Chhattisgarh High Court, Bilaspur, against the order of the investigation committee
 tab ucch nyaayalay ne chaanbin samiti ke aadesh ko nirast karte hue ek baar phir samiti kaa gathan karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 After this order, the committee was reorganized by the state government in February 2018
 aadim jati tathaa anusuchit jati vikaas vibhaag ke sachiv di di singh kii adhyakshata main bani ucch stareey pramanikaran chaanbin samiti ne jogi ko jari jati pramaan patr nirast karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Ajit Jogi became the first Chief Minister of the state after the creation of Chhattisgarh state
 varsh 2000 se varsh 2003 tak vah rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe
 During this time he was an MLA from Marwahi assembly constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes
 varsh 2003 main congress jab bhaajapa se parajeet hui tab raman singh rajya ke mukhyamantri bane
 Ajit Jogi's son Amit Jogi formed a new party when he was expelled from the Congress
 abhi vah janata congress chhattisgarh ke mukhiya hai tathaa maarwahee vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak hai
 Bihar's package politics is undoubtedly in the spotlight, but after reaching Patna one realizes that poster politics is also important for the vote
 plateform se baahar aate vakt aapako chaaron taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi hi nazar aate hai
 The leaders of Bihar BJP are missing, BJP will understand the strategy behind it better
 vaise nitish kumaar ke poster bhi nahin dikhen
 It felt like the BJP has paid a lot of attention to the poster and is ahead in the race
 lekin stesan se baahar aate hi ye soch badalati dikhti he, piem narendra modi ke poster to kam nahin hote, lekin nitish ke bade-bade poster ye bataa dete hai ki poster ke maamle main muqaabala ek tarfaa to bilkul nahin he
 Both parties have their own alliance, but the alliance is missing in the poster
 yaa to nitish hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Nitish Kumar is once again in the JDU poster, then the crime, corruption and arrogance in the BJP poster, will this alliance increase Bihar? bijepi bihar sarkaar par sawaal uthaa rahi he to phir ek baar nitish kumaar ke naare par jediu ko jeet kaa bharosa he
 But surprisingly, Lalu Prasad, who was in power in Bihar for 15 years, is missing from the posters
 bahut dhundne par lalu prasad yadav kaa bhi poster dikhaa, jisamen nitish nahin dikhe, haa rabari zarur thim
 Well my journey continued with the poster and i reached the Gandhi Setu Bridge, which connects North Bihar with the capital
 pul kii haalat lagaataar bighad rahi he, lekin is pul ko lekar poster main kahin koi zikr nahin he
 It is surprising that the bridge through which thousands of vehicles pass, how long that bridge will last, it is very difficult to say
 chaliye arase baad pul par jam nahin mila or bihar ke vaishali pahunch gaya
 The posters of Nitish and PM Modi did not diminish, but now posters of RJD started appearing
 lalu prasad se zyaada unke bete ilaakon main poster ke zarie swaagat karte nazar aae
 Tej Pratap is in Mahua and there is a flood of Tejaswi's posters in Raghopur
 vaise duusare dal ke log bhi damakham lagaate dikh rahe hai
 But after reaching Muzaffarpur, then the posters of Nitish and PM Modi start, the height of the other posters may not be so high that they look
 khayr chunaav nazadik he or muqaabala aamane-saamne kaa he
 The only thing that strikes is the growing politics towards individualism
 jitani badi tasviren lagi hai, agar usamen yojanaayen yaa kaamon kaa zikr hota to janata ko bhi tay karne main shaayad aasaani hoti ki kiskaa saath den
 The public is sensible and will not choose poster politics and package politics but will choose the one who will have power
 bihar bijepi ke netaa gaayab hai, iske peeche kii ranneeti bijepi behatar samajhati hogi
 By the way, posters of Nitish Kumar are also not visible
 laga jaise vaaki bijepi ne poster par kaaphi dhyaan diya he or res main wo aage he
 But as soon as he comes out of the station, this thinking seems to change, the posters of PM Narendra Modi are not diminished, but the big posters of Nitish tell that there is absolutely no one-way competition in the matter of the poster
 donon dalon kaa apana-apana gathbandhan he, lekin poster main gathbandhan gaayab he
 It is either Nitish or Prime Minister Modi
 jediu ke poster main phir ek baar nitish kumaar hai to bijepi ke poster main aparaadh, bhrashtachar or ahankaar, kya is gathbandhan se badhegaa bihar
 If the BJP is questioning the Bihar government, then once again the JDU is confident of winning the slogan of Nitish Kumar
 lekin hairaani kii baat he bihar main 15 saal tak satta main rahe lalu prasad postaron se kyon gaayab hai
 After searching a lot, a poster of Lalu Prasad Yadav was also shown in which Nitish did not appear, yes Rabri was definitely there
 khayr poster ke saath meraa safar jari rahaa or main pahunch gaya us gandhi sethu pul par, jo uttar bihar ko rajdhani se jodta he
 The condition of the bridge is continuously deteriorating, but there is no mention in the poster about this bridge
 ye baat hairaan karti he, jis pul se hazaron gaadiyaan guzarati hai, wo pul kab tak tikaa rahegaa, kahana bahut mushkil he
 Let us not find the bridge jammed for a long time and reached Vaishali in Bihar
 nitish or piem modi ke poster to kam nahin hue, lekin ab argedy ke poster dikhne lage
 More than Lalu Prasad, his sons were seen welcoming in the area through posters
 mahua main tej pratap to vahiin raghopur main tejasvi ke postaron kii baadh he
 By the way, people of other parties are also seen to be stunned
 lekin mujaffarpur pahunchate-pahunchate phir nitish or piem modi ke poster shuru ho jate hai, baaki postaron kaa kad shaayad itnaa ooncha nahin ki wo dikhen
 Well, the election is close and the competition is face-to-face
 bas jo baat khatkati he wo he vyaktvaad kii taraf badhati raajnneeti
 If the big pictures are posted, if the plans or works were mentioned in it, then the public might also have an easy decision on who to support
 kair janata samajhadaar he or wo poster politics or package politics par nahin balki use chunegi jisaki baton main hoga dam

 kya kisi insaan ke sharir main chip feet kar use robot banaaya ja saktaa he? pehle pahal yah sawaal atapata lag saktaa he, lekin ek aatanki ne police par aarope lagaaya he ki uske dimag main chip feet par police uskaa robot kii tarah istemaal kar rahi he
 Not only this, the terrorist says that he does not sleep and hears dirty abuses
 aatanki ne court se guzarish kii he ki oparesh ke jariye uske dimag se chip ko baahar nikaala jaae
 In fact, Shamli militant Abdurrahman alias Moe, who is lodged in Lucknow jail in connection with country maliciousness, conspiracy and attempt to murder
 ikbaal ne dilli police par aarope lagaaya ki usne oparation ke jariye uske sharir main magnetic chip feet kara die hai
 This has made his life like a robot
 ikbaal ne adaalat se guzarish kii he ki siti scan or emarai karwaakar chip nikalwai jaae
 Special Judge BL Kesarwani in the case has directed the police station in-charge Wazirganj in Lucknow to submit a detailed report to the court before July 10
 jaankaree ke mutabik, jail adaalat main arji dekar ikbaal ne bataaya ki dilli police kii vishesh shakha ne use 21 march 2008 ko use giraftaar kiya tha
 Then he was kept in custody for more than two months without presenting it before the magistrate
 is dauraan dilli police ne na sirf use har tarah se pratadit kiya balki oparation ke jariye uske sir, aant or appendix ke paas magnetic chip lagava die
 He was then sent to jail on 22 May 2008
 chip ke garm hone par hoti he pidaanyaayalay main di gai arji main usne bataaya he ki chip lagaae jane ke baad se vah ek robot kii tarah ho gaya he jiskaa sanchaalan koi or kar rahaa he
 He cannot sleep at night due to a chip in his head

 When this chip gets hot, there is unbearable pain and it seems that the head will explode
 iske saath hi pet main lagaai gai chip ke kaaran bhi kai tarah kii pareshaaniyaan hoti hai
 In Tihar Jail, the authorities were requested to get the chip removed, but he was shifted to Lucknow Jail
 ikbaal ne arji main kaha he ki uske pet va sir par oparation ke nishaan chip lagane ke hi hai
 Significantly, Delhi Police ikbaal ko giraftaar karke jail bheja tha
 He was shifted to Lucknow Jail on 13 October 2012 in connection with the Wazirganj police station for conspiracy, conspiracy and attempt to murder
 tab se vah lakhanu jail main hi band he

 BJP is trying to win all the seats in this election so that the myth of defeat in the by-elections held so far can be broken

 On the fitness challenge of Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, the Congress leaders fiercely attacked Tanjana and the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party including Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin is bich congress netaa or purv kendriya soochna prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne chaunkaane vaala video twit kiya he
 In fact, 52-year-old Congress leader Manish Tiwari, accepting the challenge of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, put on push ups like a professional gym trainer and also shared his video on social media

 Manish Tiwari also tweeted a video of push ups and challenged them to do better and wrote, 'there is nothing better than doing push ups

 com / oldhzvps0h— Manish Tewari (@manishtewari) May 25, 2018 After this video was posted on Friday, people on Twitter also started speculating that they were going to join BJP
 haalanki, manish tiwari dwaara ye chunauti sweekaar karne ke pehle tamaam congressi netaaon ne is fitness chalange par sawaal khadey kiye the
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi asked the Prime Minister to accept the challenge of reducing fuel prices, otherwise the Congress will start a nationwide protest
 vahiin congress pravaktaa pramukh randeep surajevaala ne modi se kaha ki vah rashtriya suraksha, naukariyaan, bhrashtachar or kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya jaisi chunautiyon se nipten
 RJD leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Tejashwi Yadav said that before tackling the fitness challenge, Modi must face the challenge of filling empty stomachs and giving jobs to the unemployed of the country
 makapa netaa seetaram yechuri ne 'just jumala' hashtag kaa istemaal karte hue twit kiya, 'kachche tel kii keemton se modi kaa saamana hamen us puraani kahawat kii yaad dilaataa he
 After the tide comes down, it is known who is swimming naked
 ab vah fitness chunauti jaise nae tamaashe se hamaara dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 'let me tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accepted the' fitness challenge 'of Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli under the campaign of Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore launched on social media to promote fitness in the country
 viraat ne twitor par rathore dwaara shuru kii gai muhim 'ham feet to india feet' ke tahat pradhanmantri narendra modi, purv cricket captain mahendra singh dhoni or apni patni abhinetri anoushka sharma ko tag kiya tha
 On this, Modi accepted the challenge and tweeted- 'challenge is accepted, Virat
 main jaldi hi apanofitness chalanjavideo aplod karuunga
 ' arun jetali nahin rahe, shaayad bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga ki agar vah naa hote to naa chaara ghotaale kii sibiai jaanch ho paati or naa lalu yadav jail jate
 Apart from this, he also played an important role in making Nitish Kumar the Chief Minister, which he never beaten
 arun jetali, 70 ke dashak se chaatr andolan main sakriy rahane ke kaaran bihar ke adhikansh gaiyr bijepi dal khaskar samaajawaadee andolan se zude netaaon ko bakhubi pahachaanate the
 The real role of Arun Jaitley in the politics of Bihar started actively from the era of fodder scam
 us samay patna hoicourt main jo yachika susheel modi, sarayu raay, shivanand tiwari or lallan singh ne daayar kii thi, jisamen ravishankar prasad ne bahes kar khyaati batori thi
 From drafting to filing that petition, Arun Jaitley's role was crucial
 patna hoicourt se sibiai jaanch ke aadesh ke baad jab bihar sarkaar sarvocch nyaayalay gai tab desh ke saare top vakeelon ko apni pairvi ke liye anges kiya tha
 And from the side of the petitioners, due to Arun Jaitley and George Fernandez (then chairman of the Samata Party), Shanti Bhushan debated and the decision of the CBI investigation was finally approved by the Supreme Court as well as the monitoring of the Patna High Court The order took place
 ye ek aisa maamla he jahaan sibiai ne 90 pratishat se adhik abhiyukton ko sajaa dilaane main kamyaabi pai or aaj bhi lalu yadav jail main hai
 But even when the investigation was going on, many times this case reached the threshold of the Supreme Court
 har baar arun jetali ne yaa to khud bahes kii yaa bahes karne ke liye koi anya vaqeel karne kii salaah di
 Despite all the political power, the fodder scam is currently being sentenced to life in prison and Arun Jaitley's role in this whole case was that of Chanakya
 chaara ghotaale kii vajah lalu yadav kamazor to hue lekin satta main rabari devi kaa daur barkaraar rahaa
 At the same time, Arun Jaitley was made in charge of Bihar BJP
 aap kah sakate hai ki isi ke saath bihar kii satta se lalu raaj kaa asal ulti ginati shuru ho gai
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA alliance won only 11 seats and Nitish Kumar lost the election from his old seat
 centre main upie kii sarkaar bani or lalu yadav ko rail mantralay kii jimmedaari mili
 The NDA alliance was discouraged by this defeat and Rabri Devi's return to the 2005 assembly elections was believed to be certain
 lekin lalu-paswan main sar fotwwal ke kaaran parinaam trishanku rahe
 Finally, for the first time in Bihar, the President's rule was imposed without a session of the Legislative Assembly
 arun jetali ne ek chatur ranneetikaar kii tarah ye bhaanpane main bilkul bhi galati nahin kii ki bihar ke log rabari devi se chhutkaaraa chaahate hai or endie kii ore se bhi bihar kii janata ek vaikalpik cheharaa chaahati he
 Where Nitish Kumar's rating was higher than other leaders due to the work done by him as Railway Minister
 chunaav parinaam ke ek maheene ke andar lok janashakti party vidhayak dal ko todane kaa abhiyaan chalaa jisamen bahu had tak arun jetali or bijepi ke logon ne sakriy bhoomika adaa kii
 However, due to Lalu Yadav's pressure at the center, President's rule was imposed in Bihar by dissolving the assembly by calling a cabinet meeting at midnight
 (jiske bare main lalu yadav aaj tak maanate hai ki unke raajnneetik jivan kii ek badi bhul rahi) is faisle kaa faaydaa uthaate hue jahaan arun jetali ne ek ore supreme main cabinet ke faisle ke khilaaf yachika daayar kii to vahiin duusari ore aagaamee chah maheenon main hone vaale chunaav kii taiyaari main bhi lag gaye
 When he realized that a section of the party would not consider Nitish Kumar as the leader due to factionalism in Samata Party, he took Pramod Mahajan in confidence, and Nitish Kumar was declared the nda's Chief Ministerial candidate with the resentment of the leaders of Bihar unit Got it done
 phir nitish kumaar ko puure bihar main nyaay yatra par nikalne kii salaah bhi di
 Jaitley himself campaigned in Patna in the october-november elections and the Lalu Rabri era finally came to an end
 bahumat nitish kumaar ko mila or tab se aaj tak nitish kumaar bihar ke mukhyamantri (kuch maheenon ko chhodkar) bane hue hai
 According to experts, Arun Jaitley's original idea of making Nitish Kumar not only CM but also Sushil Modi as Deputy Chief Minister was the same
 bihar ke NDA gathbandhan main jab bhi koi gambhir sankat hua (jaise ki 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke kuch maheenon pehle jab nitish kumaar ne narendra modi dwaara die gaye ek vigyaapan ke aadhaar par dinar cancil kiya tha uske baad gathbandhan tut kii ore bad rahaa tha) arun jetali ne hi kaman sanbhali
 Perhaps this is why all BJP leaders believe that the role of Arun Jaitley was a crisis in the party
 arun jetali ke in tamaam kaaryon ke baavjood dhur virdohi lalu yadav ne unke khilaaf kabhi katu shabd nahin bole
 The reason for this is that Jaitley had a personal relationship with everyone
 iske baad jab jetali cricket kii raajnneeti main sakriy hue to lalu yadav (jo bihar cricket assosieshan ke adhyaksh the) vahi karte the jo jetali unase chaahate the
 This thing is not hidden from anyone
 2015 ke chunaav main mili haar ke baad jetali ko is baat kaa andaaza ho gaya ki nitish ke bina kisi kii sarkaar nahin ban sakati
 Then Lalu Yadav, in the plea of his case, made some such things through the mouth of Prem Gupta, who went with him on the pretext of meeting him, about which the foundation of the government of the Grand Alliance was laid as soon as Nitish Kumar got information
 madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or varisht congress netaa digvijay singh (digvijay Singh) ne shivaraj singh chouhan (shivraj Singh Chouhan) ke bayaan par tanj kasate hue kaha he ki rajya main 'tiger' kaa sangrakshan kiya jayega
 Digvijay said, 'tiger will be protected
 yah durlabh praani hota ja rahaa he
 Digvijay Singh's statement came at a time when former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had said earlier that 'no one needs to worry, Tiger is still alive
 'bataa den ki madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne rajya main congress kii sarkaar banane ke baad rajya ke matadaataaon ko nishcint rahane kaa aashwaasan behad anuthe style se diya tha
 Impressed by Bollywood's' Sultan 'salman Khan's film' Tiger Zinda Hai ', Shivraj while addressing the people of his constituency Budhni said, don't worry about what will happen next, because' Tiger is still alive
 ' budhani ke matadaataaon kaa aabhaar vyakt karte hue shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha, 'kisi ko bhi is baat kii chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin ki aage kya hoga
 i am here right now 
 
 tiger abhi zindaa he
 
 
 On the question of Hanuman's caste, Singh said, "yogi Adityanath said that Bajrang was a Dalit, Bukkal Nawab called him a Muslim, now BJP minister Chaudhary Saheb is calling him a Jat
" jo log aisa kah rahe hai unhen maafee maangani chahie or vihip va akhaada parishad ko aise logon kaa tiraskaar karnaa chahie
 In the recently concluded assembly elections, Congress became the single largest party by winning 114 out of the total 230 seats in the state, while BJP won 109 seats
 inke alaava uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (BSP) ko do, samaajawaadee party (SP) ko ek seat mili thi, jabaki chaar siton par nirdaleey pratyaashee jite the
 Later, the BSP and SP supported the Congress and formed their government
 film manikarnika bhale hi darshakon ke bich saraahi ja rahi he, lekin kangana ranut or film ke sah-nirdeshak krish ke bich vivaad khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 Krrish alleges that Kangana wanted to do everything by herself in the film
 ve kisi anya kirdaar ko haaavee nahin hona dena chaahati thi, isiilie unhone baaki kirdaaron kii bhoomikaayen choti karvaa deen
 Even the character of Sonu Sood was made 100 minutes to 60 minutes, after which he left the film
 krish ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan kaha- "film june main puri edit ho gai thi
 The dubbing was also completed by everyone except for Kangana's character
 kangana landan main "mental he kya" kii shooting kar rahi thim
 When she returned and saw the film, she said that she liked it, but she wanted a little change in it
 iske kuch din baad boleen iskaa zyada he, uskaa zyada he
 This girl is strong, she is strong
 ye change karnaa he wo change karnaa he
 He said that producer Kamal Jain also did not like the film

 He consulted Prasoon Joshi about how it would happen
 iske baad kangana achaanak sonu ke kirdaar sadashiv raav ko interval main hi maarane kii jid karne lageen
 Which was completely against history
 krish ne kaha ki jab ye baat produsar camel jain ke saamne ai to unhone kaha isse kya fark padataa he, vahi karo jo film ke hit main ho
 Kamal Jain favored Kangana
 jab krish ne is part ko diarect karne se inkaar kar diya to camel jain ne kaha ki ise kangana diarect karengi
 Krrish said that Sonu Sood's character Kangana made 100 minutes to 60 minutes, obviously no one would want to do a film after that
 jabaki ve 35 din kii shooting kar chuke the
 Kangana's other character was also edited and got smaller

 It all sounds very strange and scary to hear and see, but this is the truth of a house in Delhi
 darasal, dilli ke ek ilaake main kuch din pehle bore main band ek mahila kii laash mili thi
 The police, while solving the case, arrested a lady dancer and her live-in partner for murder
 jo do din tak mahila kii laash ke saath kamare main rahe the
 Police have revealed that a woman named Mililashahlima was in the block of j & s under Delhi's Shakarpur police station
 jise firoz or suman urf puja naamak aropiyon ne peet-petakar maar daalaa tha
 Both of them also tried to damage his face after his murder, so that he could not be identified
 police ke anusaar haleema peshey se ek dancer thi
 She used to live in a live-in-relationship with Feroze, but she split from him four years ago
 uske baad firoz suman urf puja ke saath lakshmi nagar ke ek flats main rahane laga tha
 During this, Halima once again came in contact with Feroze
 donon ke bich shikave gile dur ho gaye
 Halima wanted to be with Feroze again
 isliye vah suman ko firoz kii jindagi se nikaalane kii koshish main thi, lekin firoz haleema ko bevafa maanata tha, isliye usase peechha chhudaana chahta tha
 Police said that on the night of July 27, Halima reached Feroze's flat in Laxmi Nagar
 vahaan suman bhi maujuud thi
 Meanwhile, there was a lot of discord between the three and after that Feroz and Suman beat Halima badly
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui donon milakar haleema kaa galaa dabaakar uskihatyakar di
 After the murder, Suman and Feroz also tried to spoil Halima's face so that she could not be identified
 uske baad donon ne laash ko ek bore main daalkar thikaane laga diya
 During interrogation, Feroze told the police that he had married Alima in Assam, although no evidence has been found yet
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki firoz or uski liv in partner suman ne pehle alima kaa murder kiya or phir body ko bed ke box main daal diya or 2 din or raat ye donon isi bed par na keval soe balki laash ko thikaane lagane kii plannig bhi karte rahe
 For two days, both of them prepared and ate food by keeping the corpse at home and also watched TV
 do din baad firoz do bade plastic bag kharidkar laayaa or usame alima kii body ko rakhkar bore main daali or ghar ke paas hi kooday main phenkakar aa gaya
 Now the police have arrested both the accused
