 aarope he ki sibiai ne in mantralayon ke afasaron ke kehane par mul stats report main pherbadal kiya tha
 It is clear that the difficulties faced by the UPA government in the whole case are going to increase further

 According to sources, big government officials are taking the opinion of law experts on this matter

 The opposition is demanding the resignation of Law Minister Ashwani Kumar and the government knows that if any scathing remarks are made by the Supreme Court, it will face new trouble

 The Additional Solicitor General has accused Vahanvati of interfering in the functioning of the CBI
 harin rawal ne apni chitthee main kaha he ki atorni general ne aise kai maamalon main dakhsandaji kii jisaki sibiai jaanch kar rahi he
 The Additional Solicitor General has written that he is being made a scapegoat
 bijepi ko mila ek or maukaedishnal solicytor general ke khulaase nebijapi ko sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa ek or maukaade diya
 BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy has said that the new revelations by the Additional Solicitor General have put everyone in the loop
 unhone kaha ki is khulaase ke baad yah sabit ho chukaa he ki pradhanmantri bhi puure maamle main doshi hai or unhen fouran istipha de dena chahie
 There was a huge uproar in Parliament on Monday on the bjp's scandal over the pm's resignation
 vipaksh ke hangaame ke kaaran donon sadanon main koi kaamkaaj nahin ho sakaa
 The BJP is still firm on the demand for the Prime Minister's resignation
 bijepi ne pradhanmantri ke saath-saath kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar kaa bhi istipha maanga he
 Given the stubborn stance of the BJP, it has become clear that the deadlock in Parliament on this issue will continue
 kya maut kii sajaa ke liye faansee ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin ho saktaa
 a petition filed in the Supreme Court, calling the hanging as barbaric and inhumane, appealed to consider other options for capital punishment
 kanoon main bhi faansee kaa matlab durdaant or sangeen apradhi ko saanson kii aakhri door tuutane tak faansee ke fande par latakaae rakhana he
 When a convict is sentenced to death, the court says 'hang till death', which means that the convict should be hanged as long as his body is still alive
 lekin ab supreme court main daakhil is yachika ke jariye kanoon main sanshodhan kii maang kii gai he
 The petition cited a judgment given by the five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court, stating that the bench had said in its judgment that fundamental rights have the right to live with dignity and respect as well as dignity and respect The right to die is also included
 lekin faansee sammaan ke saath marane ke adhikaar ke vipareet he lihaaja ise khatm kar iske vikalp kii talash honi chahie
 The petition has sought the repeal of Section 354 (5) of the crpc, which provides for hanging, ie 'hang till death'
 yachikakarta ne faansee ko maut kii sajaa dene kaa sabase barbar tarika bataaya he, kyonkifansee se maut main 40 minute tak lag jate hai, jabaki goli maarane yaa electric chair vidhi main keval 2 minute
 The Law Commission also recommended abolition of punishment-a-death for all other crimes except terrorism and war against the country
 yah sifarish 2015 kii report ke jariye pichley saal kii gai thi
 Then 6 out of 9 members agreed
 teen asahmat sadasyon main se do sarkaar ke pratinidhi the
 According to the then Law IG President Justice AP Shah, there was a clear mention in the report that the principle of eye for eye is against the basic spirit of our Constitution
 badale kii bhaavana se nyaayik tantra nahin chal saktaa
 The commission report also mentions that 140 countries have abolished capital punishment in the 21st century
 bharat main bhi durlabhtam or nrushansatam maamalon main hi faansee kii sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 But the Supreme Court itself has admitted many times that this principle has also been used arbitrarily
 lau kamishan ne bhi sajaa-e-maut kii jagah umrakaid kii pairokari kii thi
 However, the State Governments have the right to make concessions in punishment
 lekin kai rajyon main gambhir aparaadh main 30 se 60 saal baad sajaa main chhot kaa praavdhaan he, to kai rajya 14, 16 yaa 20 saal baad achche chaal-chalan vaale kaidi kii sajaa main riyaayat kar dete hai
 The court may hear this petition soon
 jaahir he 5 jajon se badi peeth hi sunwaayee karegi

 Despite the bitter defeat in Haryana, factionalism among Congress leaders is not taking place
 haryana vidhansabha chunaav main mahaj teen maheene se bhi kam samay bachaa hua he, baavjood iske congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar or purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke bich varchasv kii jang jas kii tas bani hui he
 Due to keeping both Dalit and Jat communities together in the state, the top leadership of the Congress has avoided taking action against anyone in hooda-tanwar
 isi kaa nateeja he ki haryana main congress kaa graph 2014 ke baad se lagaataar girtaa ja rahaa he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress suffered a crushing defeat in all 10 seats of Haryana
 jabaki congress ne pradesh ke saare apane diggaj netaaon ko maidan main utaar diya tha, jisamen purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda, pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar se lekar purv kendriya mantri kumari shailaja tak shaamil hai
 Even after this, the Congress did not even open an account in the state, even losing the Rohtak seat
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar ke baad bhupendra singh hooda ne 9 june ko dilli main pradesh bhar se apane samarthakon ko bulaakar sandesh diya ki agle ek saptaah main pradesh congress main pherbadal ho jayega or pradesh congress kii kaman unke kheme ke paas hogi
 In response to this, State President Ashok Tanwar, on June 12, in a meeting of workers in Gurugram, took a taunt on Hooda without saying that those who talk about change in a week nowadays have been saying the same thing for the last four and a half years
 Are, but could not get any change till date
 darasal ashok tanvar or bhupendra singh hooda ke bich siyaasi varchasv kii jang aaj kii nahin he balki pichley kai saalon se chali aa rahi he
 This factionalism led the Congress to lose in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and again in 2014, the state lost its power and the BJP broke into power with an absolute majority on its own
 congress ke sheersh netritv ne party main gutbaji khatm ke liye loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se thik pehle hooda-tanvar ko ek bas main baitaakar dilli se haryana tak kaa safar tay karaayaa, iske baad bhi donon netaaon ke bich raajnneetik varchasv kii jang kam nahin hui
 The party had to bear the brunt of this in the Lok Sabha elections
 congress haryana main ek ke baad ek chunaav haarane ke baad bhupendra hooda or tanvar par kisi tarah kii karrwai karne se bachati rahi he
 The caste votebank of both the leaders is the reason behind this
 rajya main 25 fisadi jat, 20 fisadi dalit samudaay ke voter hai
 This is the reason that if action is taken against one, the other community will get a wrong message among the people
 or isi kashmakash main congress kii lutiyaa haryana main duubati ja rahi he
 The Congress is preparing for a new experiment to end the factionalism of Congress veterans in Haryana in preparation for a new experiment
 rajya main purv siem bhupendra singh hooda or ashok tanvar kii ladaai main purv kendriya mantri kumari shailaja ko phayda ho saktaa he
 In Haryana, there will be an effort to help Dalit voters by handing over the command of Tanwar to Kumari Selja
 saath hi congress haikaman sabhi guton ko ek door main baandhne kii manshaa se teen kaaryakari pradesh adhyaksh banane kaa daanv bhi chal sakati he
 At the same time, Bhupendra Singh Hooda can be made the leader of the legislative party in the direction of working the Jat community
 abhi ek bahan ke bare main pataa nahin chal sakaa he, police ko shaq he ki raju kaa puraa gang he or ho saktaa he ki ye donon maamle ek hi gang se jude hon
 After the loss of 214 runs in the fifth and final ODI at the hands of South Africa, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni once again insisted to focus on the 'process' and said that some issues should be resolved quickly to bring the team to the ground Will be dakshin africa ke chaar wicket par 438 ran ke jawaab membhartiya team 36 over main 224 ran par out ho gai
 Dhoni said after the match, 'I know that everybody in India wants results but not paying attention to the process will not give results
 yah kathin sthiti he
 He said, 'but we are also looking for a solution
 hamen kuch or chijen aajamaani hongi kyonki ek sa karne par nattejey bhi ek se milenge
 'south Africa has won the first bilateral ODI series in India
 isse pehle usne tii20 shrinkhalaa bhi 2-0 se jiti thi
 Dhoni said, 'we have to look at a big level or else you can win a couple of series
 lagaataar achche pradarshan ke liye sthir or santulit team chaiye 
 He seems to be lacking in our team
 ’ ballebaaji kram main badlaav ke liye aalochana jhel rahe dhoni ne kaha ki unhen alag-alag halaat ke liye alag samaadhaan talashne the
 He said, 'you have to make changes according to the field, wicket and conditions
 maine ballebaaji kram main kuch badlaav kiye taaki use majboot banaaya ja sake
 'akshar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are the best spin bowlers, all-rounder, also said that Stuart Binny was the best seam bowling all-rounder in just one ODI, while Akshar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are the best spin bowlers
 unhone kaha, ‘ham bolte rahenge ki hamaare paas seem gendbaaj harfanmaulaa nahin he
 When we tried Stuart, people criticized him too, but he is the best seam bowler all-rounder in the country, while Jadeja and Akshar are the best spin bowlers all-rounder
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamen sarvshereshth gendbaaji sangyojan utaarne ke tareeke talashne honge lekin uske liye ballebaaji ko halake main nahin liya ja saktaa
 These problems have to be solved
 ’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘acchhee baat yah he ki abhi hamaare paas samay he lekin hamen in sthanon ke liye khilaadiyon ko talashna hoga
 We have to find players who can withstand the pressure of international cricket and once successful, the work will become easier
 ’ unhone madhyam tej gendbaaj mohit sharma or bhubaneshwar kumaar ko utaarne ke faisle kaa bhi bachaav kiya jinhone kramash: 84 or 106 ran de daale 
 The captain said, 'we also tried fast bowlers who had speed but they were giving more runs, so we got medium fast bowlers
 mohit ko teesraa simar hona chaiye lekin aapako chunanaa hoga ki koun deth gendbaaj hoga, koun bich ke over daalega or koun nayi gend sanbhaalega
 He said, "we have tried many fast bowlers who have not performed well but they are playing well in Duleep Trophy, Deodhar Trophy or IPL
 ’pradarshan itnaa kharaab tha ki ve use bura bhi nahin kah sakatedhoni ne majaak main kaha ki kal gendbaajon kaa pradarshan itnaa kharaab tha ki ve use bura bhi nahin kah sakate
 He said, "south African batsmen made good partnerships on a flat wicket
 unke khilaaf koi ranneeti nahin chal saki
 i wouldn't call it a bad performance because it was worse than that
 ’ yah poochne par ki match main galati kahaan hui, unhone kaha, ‘ye sawaal aaj mat puch match main galati kahaan hui, saadhe chaar sau ran ke aasapaas bane or aap poochhate hai ki galati kahaan hui
 Some catches have been missed, there have been shortcomings in bowling
 hamane 20-25 over tak niyantran rakhaa lekin uske baad unhone 10, 12, 15 ran prati over se ran banaaye
 a target of 438 or 440 runs is not easy
 ’unhone kaha, ‘unhone acchhee ballebaaji kii
 We also should have formed partnerships and play the full 50 overs
 kai baar kamyaabi milti he, kai baar nahin
 Dhoni suggested making the turning wicket in ODI cricket, saying, "this wicket was good for batting but the spinners did not get any turn
" is wicket se naa to hamaare spinneron ko madad mili or naa hi tej gendbaajon ko
 This is the reason why he scored so many runs because it was difficult to stop on fours
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘aapako johanisburg yaa anya kahin terning wicket nahin milenge
 Our strength is different and there should be wickets accordingly

 Elections in Madhya Pradesh are going to the assembly, but the reputation of six mps is at stake in Gwalior district, as Gwalior district is the residence of six mps
 isamen paanch bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke or ek congress se shaamil hai
 Gwalior has a special place in the state to national politics
 baat bhaajapa kii karen to isi shahar ne use atal bihari vaajapeyi, vijaya raaje sindhiya or kushabhau thakare jaise netaa die hai
 At the same time, the relationship of Madhavrao Scindia of Congress is also from this city
 vartmaan daur main to gwalior bhaajapa netaaon kaa garh he
 Rajya Sabha MP is the residence of bjp's National Vice President Prabhat Jha, Maya Singh, Kaptan Singh, Lok Sabha MP and BJP President Narendra Singh Tomar and Yashodhara Raje Scindia in this district

 The district has six assembly constituencies, the Congress won three seats in the 2008 elections, BJP two and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidates one
 bhaajapa ne is baar do pratyaashiyon, yashodhara raaje sindhiya va maaya singh ko kramash: shivpuri or gwalior se vidhansabha chunaav main utaara he
 Except for the capitals of the country and the states, Gwalior will probably be the only district where six mps have their residence
 bhaajapa or congress ke pramukh netaaon ke prabhaav vaala jila hone ke kaaran yah unki pratishtha se jud gaya he
 Congress state general secretary Ashok Singh has alleged that BJP mps are not interested in development
 yahi kaaran he ki paanch-paanch saansad hone ke baad bhi yahaan vikaas nahin hua
 Currently Congress MP and Union Minister Scindia through his department gave power project here and also got funds for development from Central Government
 yahaan beete 10 varsho se vikaas puri tarah thama hua he
 What is in Gwalior is a product of the Congress era itself
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa va gwalior ke purv mahayor vivek shejwalkar kaa kahana he ki sab par mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii chhavi baari he, or beete 10 varsh main yahaan hue vikaas kaaryon ke kaaran tasviir hi badal gai he
 Therefore, the BJP will benefit from this in the coming elections

 unhone kaha, mahagathbandhan ke tuutane ke baad party ke log chaahate the ki party alaakaman patna aaen or halaat ko samajhen lekin aisi kuch nahin hua
 Ashok Chaudhary's term as state president has been completed and the Congress high command can announce the new state president anytime
 aise main ashok choudhary ke liye yah bahut vikat paristhiti he
 First he went to the post of minister and now he is on the verge of leaving the post of state president
 haalanki unka kahana he ki mahagathbandhan ko jeet milane ke baad congress ne hi nitish kumaar ko siem pad ke liye pramot kiya lekin ab wo bijepi ke saath chale gaye to usamencongreska kya dosha he

 a new case has come up in the Parliament House complex
 mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress main sabhi saansadon se party ke kharche ke khate se 2 hajaar rupee liye jate hai
 Which is the responsibility of gathering Trinamool Congress MP Ratna Dinag
 ratna denaag, mamata kii kaaphi kareebi maani jaati he or vah saansadon se fund ikattha karne kaa kaam karti hai
 TMC MP Ratna, after collecting the funds given by the mps in the party fund during the 30 thousand cowherd session gathered in the hall, kept him in his locker at the party office in the Parliament House complex
 abhi tak yah rakam tees hajaar rupee ikattha hui thi
 But just last week, Ratna suddenly told her mps that the money kept in the locker of the party office in the Parliament House complex was missing, after which the party mps said that you might check in your house and it will be there
 lekin ratna ne kaha ki maineparty fundke rupee loker main hi rakhe hai, jiske baad maamla gambhir ho gaya
 To complain or not to complain, TMC party mps were fearing that the party would be disgraced and Mamata didi would also be angry if a case of theft of money from such a Parliament House complex came to light, due to which many mps asked Ratna Denag Said that you put the matter here and there, there will be loss by pursuing it
 lekin ratna ne party alaakaman se baat karne ke baad khud to is maamle main media se duuri banane kaa faisla kiya, lekin party daftar ke karmchaariyon ke dwaara is puure maamle kii shikaayat darj kara di
 All is well on this serious matter - the incident of theft in the premises of the temple parliament of Chupalkotantra is a shocking thing, neither the Trinamool Congress nor the security staff of Parliament want to speak anything openly
 lekin sansad bhawan parisar main gaayab hue rupayon kii yah kahani vaaki adbhut, avishwasaneey or acolpaneey najar aati he, jisase pardaa uthaane kii jimmedaari ab sansad bhawan ke security staff kii he

 kedarnath hinduon ke chaar dham main ek dham he
 The journey there is very inaccessible
 saal 2013 main vahaan ek aisi aapadaa ghati, jisane puure desh ko hilaakar rakh diya
 Aajtak journalist Manjeet Negi made eye-witness reporting of the Kedarnath accident and continued to visit Kedarnath even during the reconstruction
 phir apane anubhavon par unhone ek kitaab likhi, naam rakhaa 'kedarnath se saakshaatkaar
 'this book is more related to the incident than the mythological significance of Kedarnath and its importance can be understood that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself praised it and wrote, "the Darun saga of Kedar tragedy, a readable compilation of Jeevat journalism"
 pragati maidan main lage vishwa pustak meley ke lekhak manch par 'sahitya ajtak' ne manjit negi or is pustak ke prakaashak hafakro ke nitin soni baatcheet kii
 Like other sessions of 'sahitya Aaj Tak', the responsibility of conducting this session was also taken up by Aaj Tak's anchor Saeed Ansari
 vishwa pustak mela 2019: meley main kahaan kya he, yahaan pard sakate hai puri detailmanjit negi ne kitaab par baat karne se pehle darshakon ko usee din shaam 5 baje kii khinchi hui tasviir dikhaayi
 Recalling that incident in June 2013, he called it a holocaust and said that the government figures killed five thousand people, but from the non-governmental figures and my experiences of a month's stay there, i can say that about ten in that tragedy Thousands of people were hunted
 mere satraa saal ke patrakarita ke kariyar main yah reporting kaa alag anubhav tha
 Manjeet told that after this incident when i reached there it was evening
 mandir ko chhod manavnirmit sabakuch tabah ho chukaa tha
 Twenty-five bodies were scattered near Nandi ji outside the temple
 himmat jutakar mandir ke andar gaya or talashne kii koshish kii
 There were no dead bodies inside
 main pehali baar kedarnath gaya tha to andhere main haath se tatolkar mandir main shivlinga dhundne kii koshish kii, to badi shila najar ai
 The destruction inside the temple had no effect
 uske baad main baba kedarnath kii krupa se kai baar vahaan gaya or apane anubhavon par yah kitaab likhi
 Halfcrow's publisher Nitin Soni said that whenever we have books for publication, after reading them, we send them to the editorial team and she takes the decision
 par jab 'kedarnath se saakshaatkaar' kitaab mere paas ai to aadha padhane ke baad meri ankhon main aansu the
 i saw this incident on TV
 par yah kitaab kuch alag hi thi
 The best part of this book is that it moves from demolition to construction
 isamen ek patrkaar or sena ke saahas or mehnat kii baangi dikhti he
 Along with this, the importance of faith is also revealed
 kitaab to acha kar hi rahi, ab isapar film bhi ban chuki thi
 Holding man-made construction behind the Kedarnath accident, the director Saeed Ansari asked the writer Manjeet Negi's opinion, his reply was the message behind the disaster
 jab aap kedarnath kii tasviir dekhenge to google par 1962 kii ek photo dikhti he, jisamen mandir ke alaava puri kedaar ghati main ekaadh jhopadiyon ke alaava kuch nahin dikhataa
 By 2013, there had been so much construction there that Kedarnath and Haridwar were starting to look the same
 jabaki kedarnath nirvana kaa dham tha
 World Book Fair 2019: Where is at the fair, you can read here the whole detailmangeet Negi said in clear terms that this tragedy was probably a message from Shiva that he did not want anything there except the temple
 unhone apni baat ko vistaar dete hue darshakon se kaha ki haadase ke dauraan aap sabane ek divya shila ke bare main suna hoga
 On the day of the tragedy, when there was a flood in Mandakini and Saraswati due to which the entire Kedarnath valley was destroyed, a rock came along that stream which stopped behind the temple
 us shila ke chalate nadi kii dharaaen do bhaagon main vibhajit ho gayi or unhone mandir ko chhod vahaan jo kuch bhi tha, use dhvansh kar diya
 Now that reconstruction work is being done there, this is being taken care of
 yah puche jane par ki kya unhone is kitaab main apane saare anubhav samete hai
 Manjit's answer was that a lot of things have been missed
 ek ghatana jo unhen yaad aa rahi ki jab ham dobaaraa puraane raste se trekking karte hue ja rahe the, to jis rambada main log kedarnath jate hue thaharte the, uskaa namonishaan tak na tha
 While there were about five thousand people there on the night of the accident
 hamen raste bhar pariwaron ke shav milte rahe
 Alam is that even today the bodies of people are found from Rambara to Kedarnath
 manjit ke mutabik rajya sarkaar ko shaayad yah abhas hi nahin hua tha ki vahaan itani badi pralay hui he
 With the steps taken by the state government in the first three days, something could have been known and saved
 kam se kam un logon kii jo thand yaa bhukh se mare the
 Praising the courage and commitment of the army, Manjeet Negi also narrated an anecdote at the request of Nitin Soni
 bataaya ki us pralayankari baadh main ek hafte se ek ghoda ek tapu main fansaa tha
 He had not got anything to eat for seven-eight days
 sena ne use bachaane kaa faisla kiya
 The helicopter somehow stopped on a patch
 andiaref ke log kisi tarah rassi ke sahare pahunche
 The horse was brought and opened on both sides of the helicopter and kept inside
 hamen kaha gaya ki donon taraf main or mere cameraman khadey rahen
 We were afraid that if the horse shook at all, we went straight down
 par bhukh-pyaas se bedam us ghode ne harakat nahin kii
 Nevertheless, we continued to read Hanuman Chalisa all the way and we were able to take it to the relief center

 Mayawati has responded to Amit Shah and said that only a speaking Prime Minister can solve the problem of the poor, laborers and small traders of the country?

 Rahul asks what we have done, then we are telling that Rahul Baba, we have done the job of giving the first speaking PM
 echdiefasi main maine 1978 se naukari shuru kii thi
 i was 26 at the time
 yah meri pehali naukari thi
 i think i grew up with this organization (HDFC was formed in 1977)
 mere kariyar main do bade mukaam aae or is sanghathan ke saath bhi vaisaa hi hua
 The first is that there has been a change in the way we do business
 echdiefasi main hamaara sochane kaa tarika badal gaya
 Although it took time to take these decisions but it made a huge difference in our business
 aaj houseing lone aam jarurat ho gaya he
 People can easily take a loan by clicking the mouse of their computer
 lekin jab hamane shuruyaat kii thi to graahak chintit rahete the ki unhen karj milegaa yaa nahin
 At that time the loan amount was maximum Rs 70,000
 hua karti thi
 But this amount was also not less than any boon for the customers
 agar unhen karj mil jaataa tha to ve hamen apane grih pravesh par nyauta dete the
 Customers from cities like Agra, Meerut, Kanpur used to come to Delhi for taking loans
 1980 ke dashak main jab main management main madhyam str kii karmchaaree thi to hamane yojana banaai ki graahakon ko unke shahar main bhi karj uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 But for this we had to grow our branches
 ek shakha kholane kaa matlab tha ki vahaan 25-30 karmchaaree rakhe jaaen
 In a small town, it was not a profitable deal, as the business was not so much
 isliye hamane hub-and-spoke model shuru kiya
 Our first spoke had just two or three employees
 graahak unke paas sampark karne aate the or baaki kaa sara kaam dilli se hota tha
 We opened the first Spoke in Kanpur and the first Spoke India Habitat Center in Delhi
 spoke graahakon ke paper ikattha karata or unhen dilli ke mukhya offis ko bhej detaa tha
 Till then there was not much progress in technology
 tab filein courier se bheji jaati thim
 Slowly the spokes started branching out on their own
 nateeja yah hua ki hamaare paas dheron offis ho gaye
 The method of expansion was very effective and the cost was also low
 aaj hamaara 40 pratishat kaarobaar majhole darje ke shaharon main ho rahaa he
 Our reputation grew rapidly due to the publicity of people
 aaj hamaare paas 25 hub or lagbhag 250 spoke hai
 The second change came because of our need
 yah echdiefasi kii soch main bada badlaav tha
 We never believed in using any middleman between us and our customers
 graahakon ke saath hamaara rishta hameshaa sauhardpurn rahaa he
 But 10 years ago, competition started increasing and representatives of other banks started arriving at the customers' home to contact them and their offices also remained open till the convenience of the customers
 isse hamaara kaarobaar prabhavit hone laga
 Initially, we tried not to hire agents
 lekin hamaari yah koshish phydemand nahin rahi
 So we thought of doing something different
 hamane agent to rakhane kaa faisla kar liya lekin unka kaam sirf graahakon se jaruri paper ekatra karnaa or karj kii sharton ke bare main bataanaa hota tha, jabaki karj dene kaa nirnay hamaare upar hota tha
 We still insist on meeting the customer directly at the time of lending
 hamane dilli main kuch agenton ke saath shuruyaat kii
 But we soon realized that we should have people who are attached to us
 isiilie hamane echdiefasi cells company shuru kii
 It is a 100% subsidiary of HDFC and is seven to eight years old
 iske karmchaaree khud ko company kaa hissaa samajhate hai
 Thus, there was no sense of giving any wrong loan
 main jab puraani baat yaad karti hum to bahut santosh hota he ki company kii unnati kii yojana taiyaar karne main main bhi bhagidaar rahi hum
 TV actress Daljit Kaur has undergone tremendous transformation

 i met him, but it's funny
 main unase 3 baar hi mili hum
 i haven't even talked to him for 9-10 months
 wo mere dost bhi nahin hai
 The mother of this big boss 'contestant' likes Vikas Gupta, asked for votes
 She said that this is a worrying situation for me
 main unase mili thi
 i did not talk to him after that
 aisa lag rahaa he jaise koi mere naam kaa phayda uthaa rahaa he
 i have a young son
 main sweekaar karti hum ki main ladaken dekh rahi hum

 aajkal job market kaaphi competative ho gai he
 It takes a lot of effort to get a job
 or jab baat ho job intervyuu kii to kaaphi baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri ho jaataa he
 If you want your interview to be successful, then you need to do many types of preparations for it
 masalan intervyuu dete samay aapako pataa hona chahie kab, kahaan, kya bolnaa he
 One wrong thing you said can take you far away from a new job
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai aisi hi 5 baaten jinka zikr aapako intervyuu ke samay nahin karnaa he
 1
 'company kii salanaa chuttee or beemaari main di jaani vaali chuttee ko lekar kya policy he? ' bhuulakar bhi intervyuu ke samay yah sawaal na puuchhen
 If you will ask this question at the time of interview, then you will feel that you are going to go on long leave after retirement
 2
 Never discuss politics and religion while giving interviews
 isaki jagah aap apane bare main bataaen ki aap kis tarah ke insaan hai or aage chalakar life main aapako kya-kya karnaa hai
 But keep in mind that do not over-exert yourself
 intervyuu main kabhi bhi apni taraf se in do topics par bhuulakar bhi charchaa na karen
 3
 'aap agle 5 saalon main apane aapako kahaan dekhte hai?' agarintervyuumen aapse yah sawaal poocha jaae to bilkul na kahen ki aap isi job main rahanaa chaahate hai
 It will feel that you do not want to move forward
 isliye jawaab kuch is tarah se den ki aapako jo jimmedaari di jaaengi aap unhen achche nibhaayenge or apni life ke aage ke lakshyon ko puraa karenge
 4
 'pichhali company main aapke bos kaise the? ' pichhali company cabosse aapke relation chahen kitne bhi kharaab kyon na hon lekin bhuulakar bhi us company yaa bos ke bare main kuch bhi galat na kahen
 If you are doing evil to the old company or boss during the interview, then the interviewers will know how unprofessional you are

 As a result, he remains a member of the BJP

 However, since the anti-romeo squad got into controversies, the exercise has started to work on its style and design
 sarkaar ne yah vyapak va ahm jimmedaari tej tarraar ipies officer navaneet sikera ko di he
 Apart from this, the top police officers are giving tips for better work

 It is worth noting that as soon as CM Yogi was sworn in in Uttar Pradesh, the scenes and videos of the anti-romeo squad raids all over the state started to be captured on camera

 They were slapped and made to sit

 His videos were made and shared on whatsapp and Facebook

 Navneet Sikera Gives Anti Romeo Squad Shapavanavneet Sikera gave members of the Anti Romeo Squad "do's and Don'ts" tips and narrated stories of being sensitive to women as well as loving couples
 unhone maukey par kaha ki police aisi harkaton se bache
 Doing this discredits them
 unka khaas jor manchalon se ladakiyon se bachaane par rahaa
 Not to disturb loving couples
 ajtak se kii khaas baatcheetis kaarykram kaa hissaa raheen mahila kanstable kahati hai ke ve premi jodon ko pareshaan nahin karte
 However, they remain outside the colleges or schools in a plain veneer so that anti-social elements can be attacked

 BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi on Saturday termed the Congress' allegations of espionage as ridiculous and said that the Congress considers itself above the law
 trivedi ne kaha ki vah ise ek mudda bana rahe hai kyonki ve khud ko kanoon se upar samajhate hai
 They think that common procedures of law do not apply to them
 rahul ke suraksha survey par dilli police kamishnar kaa bayansudhanshu trivedi ne udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi, kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii bhi isi tarah se jaanch hui he, trivedi ne kaha ki congress kaa raajnneetik jasusi kaa aarope uski maansikta ko darshata he
 He said that this is a common process which has been going on for years
 agar wo ise raajnneetik jasusi qaraar dete hai, to yah unki maansikta ko darshata he

 desh main is baar hone vaali janaganana main jati bhi puche jane kaa virodh karte hue buddhijiviyon ne nagarikon se jati ke sthaan par hindustani likhane kii apil kii he
 In a seminar on caste-based census, former Union Minister Arif Mohammad Khan said that people should point out Hindustani in place of caste by boycotting caste-based census
 is avasar par buddhijiviyon ne ek abhiyaan chalaakar jati aadhaarit janaganana kaa virodh karne kaa nirnay kiya
 He said that by conducting this campaign named 'meri Jati Hindustani', work will be done to make people aware
 videsh mantralay ke purv sachiv je si sharma, purv kendriya mantri khan or anya logon ne ek samiti banaakar is abhiyaan ko aam aadmi tak pahunchane kaa bhi nirnay kiya
 Khan said, "if only four or five crore people write Hindustani in place of their caste, it will be a big success and it will help other people to adopt it
" ’’ unhone kaha ki apni jati ko hindustani maanane vaale logon kii sankhya kam nahin he, lekin aise log philhal sangathit nahin ho paae hai
 This campaign will work to unite such people
 sangoshtee main maujuud buddhijiviyon kaa maananaa he ki jati aadhaarit janaganana desh ko baantne kii sajeesh he
 However, he said that if anyone wants to mention his caste, he will not oppose it

 It is a caste that is chosen not by birth but by its own will

 The central and state governments have agreed to negotiate with all sides of Jammu and Kashmir
 somvaar ko is bare main jaankaree dete hue grahamantri ne kaha ki jammu kashmir par baatcheet shuru karnaa chaahate hai
 Former IB chief Dineshwar Sharma will represent the Center

 He said that both the central and state government are serious about Jammu and Kashmir
 is samasya ke prati hamaari sarkaar kaa ravaiya pradhanmantri ke bayaan se pataa chalata he
 Rajnath said that as Home Minister, i am constantly visiting the state
 unhone kaha ki dineshwar sharma sabhi pakshon se baatcheet karenge or apni report centre or sarkaar ko denge
 The Home Minister said that Dineshwar Sharma will have the status of Cabinet Secretary
 dineshwar sharma kisase baat karte hai
 They will have complete freedom for this
 dineshwar sharma logon kii mahatvakanksha ko samajhenge or usee hisaab se kaam karenge
 There is complete exemption from the government
 grahamantri rajnath singh se jab yah sawaal kiya gaya ki kya chif riprogentative hurriyat netaaon se bhi sidhi baatcheet karenge to unhone sidhe jawaab na dete hue kaha ki dineshwar sharma ko is baat kii puri chhot hogi ki kashmir kii samasya ko sulajhane ke liye unhen kis se baat kerani he
 Let me tell you that through Operation Allout in the Valley, the security forces have broken the back of terrorists
 uske baad se yah mahasoos kiya ja rahaa tha ki isko ek raajnneetik pahal ke dwaara aage badhaayaa jaae taaki kashmir ke un tamaam logon ko saath liya ja sake jo aatank ke dauraan aatankiyon ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane se dar rahe the or ab sarkaar kii pahal kaa saath dene kii taiyaari main hai
 This initiative is considered to be a step towards that
 daagi janpratinidhiyon ke bachaav ke liye laae gaye bharat sarkaar ke vivaadaaspad adhyadesh par congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii tippanee par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki unke swadesh lautne par in muddon par vichaar hoga
 The Prime Minister was sleeping in his suite of 'four Seasons Hotel' here when Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was strongly condemning the ordinance and calling it 'complete nonsense'
 doshi saansadon or vidhayakon ko turant ayogy qaraar die jane ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh ko nazarandaaj karte hue unhen bachaane ke liye laae gaye adhyadesh ko mantrimandal ne haal hi main manjuuri di he
 The comments rahul ke hamale or adhyadesh ko ‘galat’ bataane vaali unki tippanee par pratikriya maangane ke liye media dwaara sampark karne par pradhanmantri ke sahyogi kii neend khuli
 The ordinance is currently with President Pranab Mukherjee for approval
 turant koi pratikriya nahin mil rahi he lekin pradhanmantri karyaalay ke sutron ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri ek oktober ko nai dilli lautne ke baad hi ‘is maamle se niptenge
 Her colleagues, who were preparing for the Prime Minister's meeting with President Barack Obama, were nervous, but she refrained from making any public comments

 The politics of Jharkhand has always been like a turbulent sea
 aise main, tab kisi ko koi tajjub nahin hua jab pratishthit jamshedpur seat par rajg kii haar ke baad kai tarah ke kayaason ko hawa milane lagi
 The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief detonated by suggesting that the chief minister's post should be interchanged but the BJP rejected his suggestion that there would be no bargaining for the top post in Ranchi
 babulal marandi kaa jharkhand vikaas morcha (jhavimo) apni sweekaaryata ko badha rahaa he, to mukhyamantri arjuna munda bahut hi samajhdaari ke saath apane dostana sambandhon ko majboot or dushmano ko kamjor karne main jute hai
 On August 10, on the same day, Munda made two tremendous moves
 unhone jahaan rajya samanvay samiti kaa pramukh banaakar shibu sorain ko cabinet mantri kaa darja dilaa diya, vahiin centre pryojit gramin vidyutikaran project main madhu kodaa ke kaarykaal kii badi aniyamittaaon kii sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kii he jo congress kaa pardaafash kar sakati he
 Because the government of that time had the support of UPA
 in surkhiyon ke alaava, yah samay jharkhand ke do yuva mantriyon par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa bhi he-ye beshak upar se ekadam shant najar aate hai lekin andar hi andar apni jaden majboot karne main bakhubi jute hue hai
 Of course, all eyes are on Jharkhand Deputy Chief Minister Sudesh Kumar Mahato and Excise and Disaster Management Minister Gopal Krishna Patar alias Raja Peter
 bahane ko taiyaarjharkhand ke 37 varshiya up-mukhyamantri sudesh mahato apane jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke adarsh pratik hai
 Like flowing water, Sudesh also seeks new ways of flowing and creates new resources
 haal hi main jamshedpur loksabhaa seat ke liye hue upachunaav main unke chune hue ummidavaar aastik mahato ne bhaajapa or jhamumo ke khel ko bigaadte hue 99,058 vot hasil kiye
 This performance of AJSU is a reflection of how this young leader is making an impressive presence in the new borders of Jharkhand
 mahato pehle hi dikhaa chuke hai ki ve kis tarah jharkhand main nai simaaon ko chhu rahe hai
 Despite the better performance in the Singhbhum region, he chose another corner of the state for the All India Students Union (AJSU-AJSU) conference
 samay ke saath hi, sammelan kaa sthaan bhi kaaphi mahatv kaa he
 Ajsu already has mlas in Chandankiyari and Ramgarh, but has to make new breakthroughs in this coal-rich area
 jameen par nazren gadaaye rahane vaale netaa kii mahato kii chhavi ko ek baar phir bal mila he or is baar yah mauka ajasu ko sammelan ke dauraan visthaapan card khilne se haath aayaa he taaki un logon ko joda ja sake jinhen udyogikaran ke naam par apni jameen se haath dhonaa padaa he
 There is a need to immediately pay attention to Mahato Garje, "displacement and Rehabilitation" in the conference
 badi sankhya main udyogon kii sthapana lajimi he lekin sarkaar ko manjuuri dene se pehle visthapiton ke liye vaikalpik rojgaar or awaas kii vyavastha bhi jarur kerani chahie
 "through the political proposal, AJSU has formed a committee which will take stock of the issue and ask the government to take necessary steps
" mahato ke sambodhan se jaahir he ki ajasu visthaapan peediton ke mudde par rajnatik or bhaavnaatmak donon hi str par apni chhap chhodane ko patibaddh he
 "various areas, including Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Koyanchal and others, are facing displacement problems," he said
 ham in sabhi sthanon par jaakar visthapiton se milenge or unki pareshaaniyon ko kam karne kii koshish karenge
 "it seems that Mahato wants to focus only on the achievable goals in small areas
" sabase bada phayda yah he ki is yuva netaa kii vishwasaneeyata he
 They can easily dent the base of established parties because they instill confidence
 yahi nahin, mahato shaayad kisi choti party ke akele vidhayak honge jinhone kabhi paala nahin badla
 After the fall of Arjun Munda's government in 2005, Mahato approved sitting in the opposition till the 2009 new elections
 is dauraan rajya main teen sarkarein ai lekin unhone paala badali nahi kii
 Sudesh did not have any political understanding before the election from the NDA but he has fulfilled his ideological commitment
 mahato main apana bharosa jataate hue pichley das maah main 30,000 yuva ajasu main shaamil ho chuke hai or bhavishya ke liye unki party ko nikhaarane main lage hai
 His bitter critics also consider him a political and skilled manager who is running his own party alone
 avibhajit bihar ke dinon main ve party ke akele vidhayak the
 Mahato's party won two seats in the 2005 election and then rose to 5 seats in the 2009 assembly elections although his candidates finished second in three seats
 asthir gathbandhan ke is daur main, ajasu pramukh saaf taur par apane kadam or aage badhanaa chaahate hai tathaa jharkhand main apane janaadhar ko majboot karne kaa iraadaa rakhte hai, jahaan kai partiyaan or netaa apana bharosa kho chuke hai
 The work is on last week, while returning from the Secretariat, Excise and Disaster Management Minister of Jharkhand Gopal Krishna Patar aka Raja Peter stopped the car at a roadside shop and got busy eating samosas with chutney
 ek ajanabi unke paas aayaa or unhen kaagaj kaa ek tukdaa thamaya
 Peter opened the paper after eating the samosa — hoping that someone would have requested the recommendation
 lekin us khat main sirf ek pankti likhi hui thi-''krupa kar jharkhand ke liye kuch karen; ham jaanate hai ki ham aap par bharosa kar sakate hai
 "at a time when the trust of the leaders of Jharkhand is at its lowest level, the king is building trust
" vidambnaa yah ki peter aise vakt main lokapriyata hasil kar rahe hai jab jharkhand main unki party janata dal (united) isse dur hoti ja rahi he
 Unlike the Bihar unit, the JD (U) is losing its image here
 82 sadasyeey vidhansabha main party do vidhayakon par simat kar rah gai he
 Jharkhand has many unwanted elements that neutralize Nitish
 kai netaa party main samta party ke jamaane se hai jo ekadam nakaara sabit ho rahe hai
 Not surprisingly, Peter, who is still new to the party, is working hard to get him out
 haalanki nitish kumaar ko jharkhand main badi sankhya main log pasand karte hai lekin unki party yahaan apana janaadhar majboot nahin kar saki he
 The party contested 18 seats in the 2009 election, but could win only two
 yahi nahin, jharkhand main jad (you) se zyada siten to nirdaleey jeet gaye the
 JD (U) continues to slow down but is lagging behind in Jharkhand
 jahaan indersingh namdhari or radha krishna kishor sareekhe varisht netaa party chhod chuke hai or rajya main kamjor netritv ke kaaran party ke paaramparik janaadhar main hris hua he
 Parties like JHVIMO and AJSU are engaged in strengthening their base by making a dent in the JD (U) 's base
 saaf taur par, jaleshwar mahato, jo lambey samay tak rajya main party ke adhyaksh rahe or jinhone haal main istipha de diya, jharkhand main party kii is durgati ke liye kisi or ko doshi nahin tehra sakate
 Jaleshwar was believed to be responsible for creating problems in the BJP-JD (U) in Jharkhand, due to which there was a huge loss of confidence in the state
 party ke sutron kaa maananaa he ki nitish kumaar rajya main party kaa or adhik hraas nahin hone denge
 Peter made headlines in 2009 when he defeated then Chief Minister Shibu Soren in the Tamar by-election
 us samay unhone jharkhand party se chunaav ladaa tha
 Inspired by Nitish, he joined JD (U) and contested from Tamar as a JD (U) candidate
 phir jaleshwar dhade ke virodh ke baavjood nitish ne unhen arjuna munda cabinet main mantri banavaa diya
 Jaleshwar's resignation also remains a mystery as no one knows why he took this step
 lekin yah saaf he ki unhone aise ahm samay main party se istipha dene kaa faisla liya jab rajya main jad (you) rajnatik rupase khud ko khadaa karne kii koshish main juty he
 His commitment to the work silences his critics
 peter kii teevr gatishiltaa or lagaataar badhati lokapriyata lagbhag usee anupaat main unke prati rajnatik jalan bhi paidaa karti he
 There are many political elements in the party and outside the party which is a reflection of his emerging image, but Nitish Kumar seems to be the right choice for JD (U) to expand in Jharkhand
 pakistan kii ek saptahik magazine 'friday times' ne chaunkaane vaala khulaasa kiya he
 According to the magazine, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia was so displeased with some of the activities of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan during the United Nations visit that he ordered the flight to return the plane from the US to the United States
 Was
 sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main shirkat ke liye america kii yatra ke dauraan imran pehle saudi arab gaye the
 He wanted to fly to the US by commercial plane from Saudi Arabia
 lekin, bin salmaan ne kaha ki yah nahin ho saktaa, imran unke khaas mehmaan hai or vah unke khaas nijee vimaan se america jaaenge
 Imran flew to America by MBS plane
 waapas isi se laut rahe the jab yah bataaya gaya ki takneekee kharabi ke kaaran unke vimaan ko bich raste se america lautnaa padaa or imran phir vanijyik udaan se waapas laute the
 Now 'friday Times' has shocked it by saying that there was no technical glitch, it was the displeasure of MBS that led to the return of Imran's aircraft
 pakistan sarkaar ke pravaktaa ne 'friday times' kii report ko khaarij karte hue ise saraasar galat or ise imran kii 'safal yatra' ko andeh ke ghere main laane kii koshish bataate hue is par gaharaa khed jataayaa he
 The Friday Times reported in its report, "in any case, fans of Imran Khan welcomed him as the winning hero upon his return from New York
" yahaan tak ki inaki taraf se suzav yah bhi aayaa ki jis vanijyik vimaan se imran jedda se islamabad laut rahe hai, use imran ke prati sammaan jataane ke liye epa-17 thunder vimaanon ke ghere main laayaa janaa chahie
 "the Friday Times" said in its report, "these supporters feel that Imran spoke in a sharp way on all the special issues like Kashmir, Islamophobia
" unhen isse koi fark nahin padataa ki (jab imran bol rahe the tab) haul aadha khaali padaa tha or unhone maan liya tha ki pakistan alqaida aatankiyon ko prashikshit karata tha
 It does not matter to them that the expectation of india-pakistan dialogue has lessened than ever before and a regional issue has been made the issue of Islamic Pakistan and Hindu India
 ''friday times' ne likhaa he, 'is yatra ke kuch anachaahe nattejey bhi rahe
 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman became so alienated from some aspects of the Pakistani Prime Minister's diplomacy in New York that he rebuked Bajahir Imran by recalling his personal plane and taking out the Pakistani delegation from it
 vah (bin salmaan) is sambhaavna se khush nahin ho sakate the ki islamic block kaa pratinidhitiv sanyukt rup se imran khan, (turki ke raashtrapati) recep taiyap erdogaan or (malaysia ke pradhanmantri) mahathir mohammad karen or bina unki (bin salmaan kii) purv sahmati ke pakistan, iran se pinge badaye
 a spokesman for the Government of Pakistan, expressing strong objection to the information of the 'friday Times', described it as incorrect
 unhone kaha, 'saudi crown prince kii taraf se imran ke vimaan ko canada se waapas america bulaane kii khabar managasaint he
 There is a good relationship between the rulers of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
 report main pradhanmantri kii vishwa ke netaaon ke saath safal baatcheet ko kamjor karne kii koshish kii gai he
 The results of the Prime Minister's meeting with the leaders of Turkey and Malaysia have been taken out of their minds
 is report kaa makasad rajnatik laabh ke liye bhaichaare vaala sambandh rakhane vaale do deshon ke bich ke rishton par hamalaa karnaa he

 uk chhattisgarh kii sabase badi uniwarsity ravishankar shukla vishvidhyalay ke campus main gaayon kii awajahi se lekar unhen paalane tak main pabandi laga di gai he
 Whatever the claim of the central and state BJP government for the protection of cows, but the university administration says that there is a possibility of infection of various diseases from animal husbandry
 uniwarsity prashasan ne apane campus main rahane vaale prophessoron or karmchaariyon ko chetavanee di he ki yadi unhone gaay bhens paali to unka sarkari awaas khaali kara diya jaayegaa
 Following the revelation of this order, the Congress has launched a scathing attack on the BJP
 chhattisgarh kii sabase badi uniwarsity ravishankar shukla vishvidhyalay raipur kaa ye aadesh he jo kisi tughluqi farmaan se kam nahin he
 In this order, the professors, doctors and staff residing in the university campus have been told that if they shift cows or buffaloes, they are not well
 aadesh ke mutabik uniwarsity parisar main gaay, bhens kii awajahi ke kaaran chaatro or shikshakon ko avrodh paidaa ho rahaa he
 This order also states that if the workers residing in the university campus have done any type of animal husbandry, they should give written consent stating that they will keep their animals tied up in the residence
 iske saath hi pashuon ke gale main pahchaan hetu tag bhi lagavaayenge
 Otherwise, the allotted house will be canceled if it is found to be in violation of the instructions
 is aadesh ke baad uniwarsity parisar main khalabali much gai he
 Because many workers keep a cow
 aadesh ke khulaase ke baad congress ne rajya kii bijepi sarkaar par karaara waar kiya he
 The Congress argues that the BJP is doing politics only for the protection of cows
 congress pravaktaa es
 According to p Singh, on the one hand, they make big claims in the name of cow protectors, on the other hand their officers who are IAS officers take orders that cows and buffalo are at risk of infectious diseases
 ek tarfasangh or bijepike log kehete hai ki gau mutr main beemaari kaa ilaaj he or isi sarkaar kaa adhikari kahata he ki gaay, bhens paalane se sankramak beemaari hogi, jo adhikari paalega use parisar se sarkari awaas chhodkar janaa padegaa
 It is the face of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 udhar aadesh jari hone ke baad kai aise karmchaaree logon kii nigaah se bachate hue apni gaay anyatra ilaakon main sthantarit kar rahe hai jo is uniwarsity parisar main rahete hai
 However, due to government regulations, these workers are unable to dare to appear before the media
 is aadesh ko lekar congress rajya kii bijepi sarkaar par taana kas rahi he
 Wahimbijepin has also admitted that this order is disputed
 ek tarafchhattisgarh sarkargau paalan ko badhaava dene ke liye kai tarah kii yojanaayen sanchalit kar rahi he
 On the other hand, such orders are enough to tell what kind of problems are being faced by animal husbandry in government premises
 germany jaisi maujuuda vijeta team ko group str par haraane vaali or aatmavishvaas se bhari mexico team fifa world cap main aaj shaam 7:30 baje se brazil se loha lene maidan par utregi
 In the pre-quarter-finals, the goal of this team will be to break the Brazilian defense and find its way to the quarter-finals
 brazil apane donon group match jeetne ke baad aatmavishvaas se bhari hui he
 Brazil, who entered the tournament with a sixth title goal, will not back down under any circumstances
 vah mexico ke pradarshan se bhaleebhanti parichit he or uskaa lakshya team ke dephence par waar karnaa hoga
 So far in the FIFA World Cup, Mexico has traveled to the quarter-finals only twice
 vah 1970 or 1986 main antim-8 main pravesh kar pai thi, vahiin brazil 13 baar quarter final main pahunchi he
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for Mexico to win against Brazil and get a place in the last-8 teams
 brazil ke liye bhale hi group str par toornament kii shuruyaat dhimi rahi he, lekin usne apane khel main sudhaar karte hue baaki donon group maichon main acha pradarshan kar pre-quarter final main jagah banaai
 Mexico beat Germany 1–0 in their first group match to prove that it would not be easy for any team to break their defense
 haalanki, dakshin korea ko haraane ke baad apane tisare group match main mexico ko sweden se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The defeat from Sweden has made Mexico even more alert
 iske alaava, is match main team ke paas unke central dephender hectares moreno nahin he
 Therefore, to avoid scoring goals against Brazil, the team must stop the attack of the rival team
 iskaa saaf matlab yah he ki mexico ko brazil ke star khilaadi philip kotinho, nemaar ko kisi bhi haal main apane gol post tak nahin pahunchane dena hoga
 Breaking the Mexico defense will be the biggest challenge for him in the pre-quarterfinal match played at the Samara Arena
 uske paas nemaar or kotinho ke alaava thiyago silva or gabriel jisas jaise khilaadi bhi shaamil hai

 Many companies are now insisting on working 24 hours to meet the target
 24 ghante offis chalane kaa matlab shift main kaam karnaa
 a large number of employees work in morning, evening and night shifts
 zyaadaatar offis main ye shift har hafte badalati he
 But do you know how the changes in the shift every week affect your body? For health, it is always morning, sometimes evening or sometimes night
 agar aap bhi is tarah kii shift main kaam karte hai to ye aapaki sehat ke liye bahut khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 This can lead to not only obesity but also diabetes and many brain diseases
 britain kii ek uniwarsity main kii gai ek study main is baat kii jaankaree saamne ai he
 This study was done on 438 people
 shodhakartaaon ne bataaya ki shift main kaam karne waalon main 33 fisadi zyada tanaav or depressant paaya gaya
 At the same time, very less stress was found in those working in the shift from 9 to 5 o'clock or those working in a fix shift
 maansik bimariyon kaa khatrashift main kaam karne vaale logon main kai tarah kii dimagi bimaariyaan bhi ho jaati hai
 According to the study, 28 percent of the 438 people were those who worked in changing shifts and were suffering from mental illness
 mood swingstudy karne vaale visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki baar-baar shift main badlaav hone se logon kii sone or jaagane kii aadat par asar padataa he
 Our body is not able to adjust the changes that are made every week, due to which people start getting irritable
 cholestrol or blad pressure kaa khatrajapan main hue ek shodh main ye baat saamne ai ki aise log jo shift main kaam karte hai unhen motopa or pachan sambandhi samasyaayein bhi hone lagati hai
 Apart from this, people also have problems like high blood pressure and cholesterol

 And where is Munna Taylor, who sits outside the Journalist Complex Society in the Vasundhara area of lower middle class in Ghaziabad adjoining Delhi
 donon main na koi rishta, na koi baatcheet
 The difference is that Jaitley is no more today and Mohammad Munna Taylor is happily cutting lives with his children
 lekin jetali nahin hote to shaayad mohammad munna aaj kaa din nahin dekh paata
 Probably it has been more than ten years
 main bijepi mukhyalay jo ki un dinon 11 ashok road par hota tha, vahaan reporting ke liye maujuud tha
 Then the wife got a call and said to me in a worried voice that Munna Taylor, who is sitting outside our society journalist's premises, is very ill and if she does not get medical immediately, she will hardly survive
 patni isse pehle bhi kai baar uski madad ke liye mujhe bol chuki thi lekin maine kabhi dhyaan nahin diya, lekin us din mujhe laga ki shaayad baat bahut aage bad gai he
 i called Arun Jaitley
 unhen bataaya ki socity ke baahar logon ke kapade seene or rafu karne vaala munna tailor he jise dil kii beemaari he
 Doctors have asked him to undergo treatment in AIIMS many times but he could not go there
 maine unhen bataaya ki agar munna tailor ko turant madad nahin mili to wo shaayad hi batch sake
 Jaitleyji told me not to worry
 thodi der main sab thik ho jayega
 Munna Taylor had reached BJP headquarters in the meantime
 uski haalat behad kharaab thi
 In a short while Arunji called me and said that i should send him to Dr
 Bishoi in AIIMS
 maine aisa hi kiya
 In the evening, Dr
 Bishoi got a call from me and he said that Munna's heart blockage is too much and a stent will have to be put for that
 unhone kaha ki kharch kii chintaa na karen or ek trust he jo aise marijon kii dekhbhaal karata he
 Mohammad Munna underwent operation
 jo kaamyaab rahaa
 Munna later spoke to me and thanked me
 maine use bataaya ki shukriya meraa nahin, arunji or dow bishoi kaa adaa karen
 Later i told Arunji that Munna has recovered and he is very grateful to her
 munna ke parivaar ke logon ne bhi unhen shukriya adaa kiya
 Such was the personality of Arun Jaitley
 unhone anginat logon kii isi tarah madad kii
 Gave houses to his staff members
 unke bacchon ko usee skool main padhane bheja jahaan unke apane bachche padhe
 Some children were even sent to study abroad
 har saal unka janmdin anathalay main manaaya jaataa tha
 They used to distribute gifts to children there
 kaha jaataa he ki achche logon kii bhagwaan ko bhi jarurat hoti he
 Perhaps that's why God called Arunji early on himself

 filmkaar-kahanikar khwaja ahamed abbaas kii kalam kii duniya bahut badi thi
 He wrote the same books in his seventy years of life
 akhbaaron or risolon main aalekh kaa to kahana hi kya
 It is said that his column was printed every Wednesday in 'blitz', titled 'the Last Page' in English and 'azad Kalam' in Urdu
 or aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki ise unhone chalis saal lagaataar likhaa, jisamen donon zabaanon ke vishay bhi aksar alag hote the
 It is said that this is a unique record of its kind in the world
 raajakmal prakaashan ne jab unki kahaniyon kaa sankalan 'mujhe kuch kahana he' naam se prakashit kiya to isaki khub charchaa hui
 All the 17 stories in this compilation have been collected by his granddaughter and his literature scholar Zoya Zaidi
 inamen kuch kahaniyaan hindi main pehali baar ain
 
 zadi kaa kahana he ki abbaas sahab aise vyakti the jinke ''jivan kaa lakshya hota he, ek uddeshy jiske liye ve jite hai
 One purpose is to change the society of man, to awaken his sleeping soul
 '' yahi kaam unhone apni kahaniyon, filmon or apane stambhon main aaajeevan kiya
 Empathy from the common man, unwavering faith in humanism, deep connoisseurship of woman's suffering, and a shrill artist-accessible jugupsa from a corrupt bureaucracy are the elements seen in these stories
 dow
 In Zaidi's words, these stories are a mirror of Abbas saheb's soul
 in kahaniyon main aapako wo abbaas milenge jo insaan ko ek viksit or achche vyakti ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the
 a special highlight of this book is an interview of Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, which was taken by none other than Krishna Chander
 ye vahi krishn chander hai jinhone tisek saal kii apni dosti ke baad unke kahani sangrah 'paaon main phool' ke prakkathan main likhaa tha, "jab main apni, ismat or manto kii kahaniyon ko padhata hoon to mujhe lagata he ki ham log ek kuubasurat rath par savaar hai
 While Abbas's stories seem as if he is flying on a plane
 hamaare rathon main chamak he
 They even have carvings on their wheels
 unki siton main bel boote lage hue hai
 Silver bells are hanging from their horses' necks
 lekin unki chaal bahut sust he
 Their roads are dirty and they have many pits
 jabaki abbaas ke lekhan main koi gadde nahin hai
 Their road is paved and flat
 aisa lagata he ki unki kalam rabar tiron par chal rahi he
 The boundaries of literature and journalism are getting blurred in the West
 vaakya chote hote ja rahe hai
 We writers have this quality in Abbas only
 "aaj abbaas kii punyatithi par unke sankalan 'mujhe kuch kahana he' se unki ek kaaljayi kahanikahani: ababil- khwaja ahamed abbasuskaa naam to rahim kaan tha magar us jaisaa zaalim bhi shaayad hi koi ho
 His name shook all over the village, neither pitying the man nor the animal
 ek din raamu luhaar ke bachche ne uske bail kii dum main kaante baandh die the to maarthe maarthe usko ad muaa kar diya
 The next day the mare of Zaildar entered her field, hit her with a stick so much that she bled
 log kehete the ki kambakht ko khuda kaa khoff bhi to nahin he
 Not even forgiving innocent children and hostile animals
 ye zarur jahannam main jalegaa
 But all this was said behind his back
 saamne kisi kii himmat zabaan hilaane kii na hoti thi
 One day, when the point came, he said, "oh brother, why do you kill children?" Just made that poor poor person that from that day people also stopped talking about not knowing what to spoil
 baaj kaa khyaal tha ki uskaa dimaag karaab ho gaya he
 It should be sent to the asylum
 koi kahata tha ab ke kisi ko maare to thane main rapat likhva do
 But who had the courage to testify against him and buy enmity with him
 gaanv bhar ne usase baat kerani chhod di
 But it had no effect on him
 subh-savere wo hal kaandhe par dhare apane khet kii taraf jaataa dikhaai detaa tha
 Nobody speaks on the way
 khet main ja kar belon se aadamiyon kii tarah baaten karata
 He kept the names of both of them
 ek ko kahata tha natthu, duusare ko chhiddu
 He used to say while running the plow, "why don't you walk straight away
 ye khet aaj tera baap puure karegaa
 And Abe Chiddu Teri bhi shamat hai kya hai? ”and then those poor people would have come
 soot kii rassi kii maar
 Both oxen were injured on the back
 shaam ko ghar aata to vahaan apane bivi-bacchon par gussa utaarata
 There is salt in lentils or greens, tore up the wife
 koi baccha sharaarat kar rahaa he, usko ulta lataka kar belon vaali rassi se maarthe-maarthe behosh kar diya
 Gharz used to have a disaster every day
 aas-paas ke jhonpadon vaale rose raat ko rahim kaan kii gaaliyon, uske bivi or bacchon ke maar khaane or rone kii awaz sunate magar bechaare kya kar sakate the, agar koi manaa karne jaye to wo bhi maar khaae
 Wife was very poor when she was killed, she seemed to be sixty years old at the age of forty
 bachche jab chote-chote the to pitate rahe
 When the elder one was twelve years old, then after killing one day who ran away, he did not return again
 qareeb ke gaanv main ek rishte kaa chachaa rahata tha
 He kept it with him
 bivi ne ek din darate-darate kaha, "bilaspur kii taraf jaao zaraa nuru ko lete aana
 "what was just then, there was a fire
 "main us badmaash ko lene jaaun
 Now even if he comes himself, i will rip off the legs
 "wo badmaash kyon maut ke munh main waapas aane laga tha
 After two years, the little boy Bindu also escaped and started staying with his brother
 rahim kaan ko gussa utaarne ke liye faqat bivi rah gai thi so wo garib itani pit chuki thi ki ab aadi ho chali thi
 But one day it hit him so much that he could not stop it
 or mauqaa paa kar jab rahim kaan khet par gaya hua tha wo apane bhai ko bula kar uske saath apni maan ke yahan chali gai
 We told Saya's lady to come and tell me that i am going to my mother's Ram Nagar for a few days
 shaam ko rahim kaan belon ko liye waapas aayaa to padosan ne darate-darate bataaya ki uski bivi apni maan ke yahan chand rose ke liye gayi he
 Rahim Khan listened silently against it and went to tie the bull
 usko yaqiin tha ki uski bivi ab kabhi na aegi
 a bull was tied inside the courtyard and went inside the hut, and a cat was doing miao miyon
 koi or nazar na aayaa to uski hi dum pakad kar darvaaze se baahar phenk diya
 When i saw the stove, it was cold
 aag jala kar roti koun daalata? bagair kuch khaae pie hi pad kar so rahaa
 The next day when Rahim Khan woke up to sleep, the day was over
 lekin aaj use khet par jane kii jaldi na thi
 Drinked milk of goats and filled the hook and sat on the bed
 ab jhonpade main dhoop bhar ai thi
 When looking in a corner, the webs were engaged
 sochaa ki lao safaai hi kar daalun
 One was sniffing the webs in a bamboo that a nest of abbeles appeared in the tile
 do ababilein kabhi andar jaati thim kabhi baahar aati thim
 At first he intended to break the nest with bamboo
 phir maaloom nahin kya sochaa
 He brought a hawker and climbed on it and looked into the nest
 andar do laal booti se bachche pade chuun chuun kar rahe the
 And his parents were hovering over his head to protect his child
 ghonsle kii taraf usne haath badhaayaa hi tha ki maadaa ababil apni chonch se us par hamalavar hui
 "ari, will the eye boil?" He said his dreadful story
 or ghadonchi par se utar aayaa
 The nest of the abbeels remained safe
 agle din se usne phir khet par janaa shuru kar diya
 None of the villagers still talked to him
 din-bhar hal chalaata, pani detaa yaa kheti katata
 But in the evening, the sun would have come home shortly before hiding
 huqqa bhar kar palang ke paas let kar ababilon ke ghonsle kii saiyr dekhtaa rahata
 Now both children were also able to fly
 usne un donon ke naam apane bacchon ke naam par nuro or bindu rakh die the
 Now his four friends in the world were left alone
 lekin unako ye hairat zarur thi ki muddat se kisi ne usko apane belon ko maarthe na dekha tha
 Natthu and Chiddu were happy
 unki qamar se zakhmon ke nishaan bhi taqariban gaayab ho gaye the
 One day, Rahim Khan was walking from the field in the morning, that some children met on the road playing latch
 usko dekhnaa tha ki sab apane juute chhodkar bhaag gaye
 He kept on saying, "oh i am a little bit kills someone
 " aasmaan par badal chhaae hue the
 Quickly brought the bulls home
 unako bandha hi tha ki badal jor se garja or or barish shuru ho gai
 After coming inside, closed the doors and lit the lamp
 hasb-e-mamul basi roti ke tukade kar ke ababilon ke ghonsle ke qareeb ek taaq main daal diye
 "hey o point
 are o nuro
 'but he did not call
 ghonsle main jo jhaankaa to chaaron apane paron main sar diye sahame baithe the
 There was a hole in the roof where Ann was nesting and the rain water was dripping
 agar kuch der ye pani is tarah hi aata rahaa to ghonslaa tabah ho jayega or ababilein be-chaari be-ghar ho jaayengi
 Thinking this, he opened the doors and climbed on the roof by putting a ladder in the torrential rain
 jab tak mitti daal kar suraakh ko band kar ke wo utraa to sharabor tha
 Many sneezed while sitting on the bed
 magar usne parvaah na kii or geele kapadon ko nichod chadar odh kar so gaya
 The next day, when i woke up in the morning, there was pain and severe fever in my body
 koun haal poochta or koun dawa laata
 He was in the same condition for two days
 jab do din us ko khet par jate hue na dekha to gaanv waalo ko tashvish hui
 Kalu Zaildar and several farmers came to see him in the evening in his hut
 jhaank kar dekha to palang par padaa aap hi aap baaten kar rahaa tha
 "hey point
 are nuru
 Where died aaj tumhen koun khaanaa degaa?" chand ababilein kamare main fadafada rahi thim
 "poor has gone mad
 " kaalu zameendaar ne sar hilaa kar kaha
 "in the morning, you will let the Shifa-eaters know that the lunatics should be sent
 "agle din subah ko jab uske padosi shifaakhaanaa waalon ko lekar aae or uske jhonpade kaa daravaaza kholaa to wo mar chukaa tha
 Four of his men were sitting silently bowing their heads

 yediurppa ne khud yahaan aane se pehle ucch shiksha mantri ve es acharya sahit apane kuch vishwasaneey logon ko dilli bheja
 Acharya, after meeting several senior leaders including party president Nitin Gadkari, claimed that the party has not yet taken a final decision regarding Yeddyurappa's future

 The inspector was in uniform at the time of the incident

 In the video, it can be seen that the inspector sitting on the driving seat himself was bleeding from many places

 People allege that the police arrived on the spot after receiving information about the incident and did not take any action against the inspector

 This time he has composed a song blaming the Delhi government for the pollution and smog spread in Delhi, which he himself has voiced on the lines of an old song

 In the presidential speech of the third 'chief Minister's Conference', Gadkari said, 'our states are making a very commendable contribution in the progress of the country
 puraa desh isi tareeke kii pragati chahta he
 But where state governments are moving fast on the path of progress, the central government remains a speed breaker (stalemate) on the path of progress
 'unhone kaha, ‘kendra kii satta paane ke liye logon kaa vishwaas jitate hue hamen yah speed braker hataanaa hoga

 goyal ne kaha ki siem pad kaa faisla party ke sansadeey board ko karnaa he or vah jo bhi faisla legi unhen sweekaar hoga

 model or eks big bos contestant sophia hayaat ne apane instagram acount par video post kar kaha he ki makka main unka yon shoshan hua he
 According to Sophia, she went to Mecca with her fiance
 sophia ne video kaa kepshan diya he, 'islam auraton kii izzat karnaa sikhaata he
 No man can touch a non-woman except his wife
 isliye mujhe islam pasand he
 But this rule does not apply in Mecca
 vahaan jaakar purush yah niyam bhul jate hai
 Today, while i was trying to touch the sacred stone, i realized that someone from behind was trying to do vulgar acts with me
 vahaan mahilaon kii line dikh nahin rahi thi, kyonki purushon ne apni shaareerik kshamta kaa prayog kar mahilaon ko dhakka dena shuru kar diya tha
 When i was one meter away from the holy stone, i was pushed, so that i could not even breathe
 main bahut dar gai
 When i looked back, my hijab got stuck in my throat
 logon ke dhakke se meraa dam ghutane laga or maine chillaanaa shuru kar diya
 Lord Shiva and Buddha will attend Sophia Hayat's wedding! Sophia further explained how some people helped her
 achaanak kuch achche log meri madad ke liye aae
 i am deeply moved by this incident
 allaah ke dar par bhi logon ko quran main likhi baaten yaad nahin rahati he
 Allah is in me and he tells me that if people feel that they will continue to disrespect such women and only after touching the holy stone will the people go away, then it is their misunderstanding
 Islam respects women
 a man must not touch a woman that is not his wife, or be violent to her
 That is why i love islam
 These rules however do not apply in Mecca
 Men forget the rules when they go there
 Today on my 2nd umra as i attempted again to touch the black stone, i was being pushed by men
 One man was pushing his genitals into me from behind
 
 the women's queue is non existent because men have used their physical strength to push women out of the way
 As i was about a metre from the black stone, i was pushed so hard against my ribs i could not breath
 i was scared, so i decided to turn back, as i did, men kept pushing, and my hijab came off and got caught between the pushing men, i was being dragged back by it and was started to be strangled by it
 i screamed
 Suddenly a few good men saw what was happening and came to my rescue
 i am so shaken up and sad that at the house of God; men do not care about the words in the Quran
 Allah is in me and she says to me that if a man thinks he will go to Jannat by touching the black stone yet disregards the respect Islam has for women, then your hajj or umrah is useless
 In the house of Allah women are being disrespected
 Allah is the greatest she is the most high 
 
 
 i am so sad this happens in her house in Makkah
 The man who lifts a women to the stone and does not touch it himself will surely see Jannat
 i appeal to the King to set up 1 day for only women so that they may with deepest respect, be able to touch the Kabba, without this non islamic behavior from men
 i know women desire as much as men to touch the kabba and stone
 
 
 so why should they have to suffer? a woman cannot match a mans physical strength
 Even in the Cave where the prophet pbuh received the Quran, people are throwing rubbish and even urinating around it as their are no toilets
 Again
 
 do you think by touching the walls of the cave your prayers will be answered if you do not look after her home? i was there 2 days and will try again
 
 i saw women trampled on and squashed by men
 
 the basic foundations of Islam
 
 peace love and respect for each other
 
 have been forgotten in the very place they should be remembered
 Namaste
 
 Salaam

 Earlier, Shiv Gopal Mishra had earlier told that he had met the Railway Minister on three dates
 is baithak main bhi railway karmchaariyon kii alouns, minimum veg or fitment formula, enpies or pension ko lekar baari rosh ke bare main railmantri sahit anya bade adhikariyon ko jaankaree di gai thi
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the 7th Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree (central employees) 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 ab tak 7wein vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baad uthe sawaalon ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se teen samitiyon ke gathan kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 In the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, a committee was formed on the dispute regarding allowance, the second committee was on the issue of pension and the third committee was made about the alleged discrepancies in the pay scale
 sabase ahm samiti visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai he
 This anomaly committee has been named
 isi samiti ke paas nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi he
 This third committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale of the fourth category employees
 yahi samiti nunatam vetanman ko badhaane kii maang karne vaale karmchaaree sanghathanon se baat kar rahi he
 This committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Finance Secretary
 samiti main chah mantralayon ke sachiv shaamil hai
 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare (HRA) ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyon kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that the Pay Commission in its report had initially fixed the HRA as 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the

 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the staff argues whether the rent of houses in cities has come down

 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced

 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the staff argues whether the rent of houses in cities has come down
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively

 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees

 nyaayadhish ne agi ko kal suchit karne ko kaha ki kya pension ke anudaan se nipatane ke liye sansad ke alaava koi tantra he saansadon ke liye
 The hearing will continue on Wednesday
 saasandon ke vetan or bhatte ko lekar daakhil janhit yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The petition calls for an independent commission on the salary and allowances of mps
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne centre sarkaar se poocha tha ki 12 saal se jo swatantra maikenism bana rahe hai, uskaa kya hua? court ne paanch march tak centre ko apana rukh spasht karne ko kaha tha
 At the same time, the central government said that independent mechanism is still under consideration
 tippaniyan Earlier, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the General Secretary of the Central Government, Election Commission, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the matter of giving life pension and allowance to former mps
 lokprahari naamak NGO ne yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki saansad kaise khud hi vetan or bhatta tay karte hai
 There should be a permanent commission for this
 vahiin purv saasandon or vidhayakon ko aaajeevan pension di ja rahi he jabaki niyamon main yah shaamil nahin he
 The petitioner stated in the Supreme Court that if a person becomes an MP even for a day, he not only gets a lifetime pension, his wife also gets a pension
 saath hi vah jivan bhar ek saathi ke saath train main free yatra karne kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he jabaki rajya ke garvanar ko bhi aaajeevan pension nahin di jaati
 Even the current judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court are not given the benefit of free travel for companionship
 chaahe vah aadhikarik yatra par hi kyon naa ja rahe hon
 In such a situation, this system is a burden for the common people and this system makes politics even more attractive
 agar asal main dekha jaae to yah kharch aise logon par kiya jaataa he jo janata kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte, isliye is vyavastha ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 The Supreme Court is hearing a public interest litigation filed for the salaries and allowances of mps
 yachika main saansadon ke vetan or bhatte ko lekar ek swatantra ayog banane kii maang kii gai he
 In the last hearing, the court had asked the central government what happened to the independent mechanisms that have been in operation for 12 years? The court had asked the Center to clarify its stand by March 5
 vahiin centre sarkaar ne kaha ki swatantra maikenism abhi vichaar main he
 The comments isse pehle purv saansadon ko aaajeevan pension or alouns die jane ke maamle main supreme court ne centre sarkaar, chunaav ayog, loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke mahasachiv ko notice jari kiya tha
 An NGO named Lokprahari has filed a petition asking how mps themselves decide salary and allowances
 iske liye koi sthai ayog hona chahie
 At the same time, former mps and mlas are being given lifetime pension, while this is not included in the rules
 yachikakarta ne supreme court main kaha ki agar ek din ke liye bhi koi saansad ban jaataa he to vah na keval aaajeevan pension kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he, uski patni ko bhi pension milti he
 At the same time, he is entitled to travel free in the train with a companion for life, whereas the Governor of the state is also not given a lifetime pension
 yahaan tak ki supreme court or hoicourt ke vartmaan jajon ko bhi saathi ke liye muft yatra kaa laabh nahin diya jaataa
 Even if he is going on an official visit
 aise main yah vyavastha aam logon ke liye boj he or yah vyavastha raajnneeti ko or bhi lubhaavna bana detii he
 If seen in reality, this expenditure is incurred on people who do not represent the public, therefore this system should be scrapped

 After the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the bjp-led NDA appears to be winning a majority in the Aaj tak-axis My India Exit Poll survey
 survey ke anusaar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) un rajyon main bhi shandaar pradarshan karti dikh rahi he jahaan kuch maheene pehle use vidhansabha chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Rajasthan is also included in this and the position of Congress here in Lok Sabha is not looking good again
 chunaav baad aae ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole survey main rajasthan main ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jaadu chalata dikh rahaa he or mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 According to the exit poll, out of the total 25 seats in Rajasthan, BJP is looking at about 23 to 25 seats and Congress is getting 0 to 3 seats
 23 may ko aane vaale chunavi nateezon main bijepi sabhi 25 siten jitati he to koi chaunkaane vaali baat nahin hogi
 Earlier in the 2014 elections too, BJP had made a clean sweep in many states including Rajasthan
 agar survey jaisaa hi rigelt aayaa to mukhyamantri gahalot ke liye bada jhatka hoga
 According to the seat of son Vaibhav Gehlot, the Jodhpur seat of Vaibhav Gehlot, son of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot himself, also looks trapped

 He informed that additional courses of b

 He said that it has been seen that where there is a lack of education, there is more child marriage and population, for which the Chief Minister has directed to establish high schools at such places and make everyone literate, to prevent and control
 
 sinha ne bataaya ki prayek ejineering collejon main prabandhan kii bhi padhai shuru kiye jane or iti literysi se mahilaon ko jode jane kaa mukhyamantri ne nirdesh dete hue kaha he ki schuli shikshakon ko computer shiksha, bhashaa va ganit main paarangat hone kii jarurat he or iske liye unhen sankul evam bipard se prashikshan diya jaae

 Besides the Chief Minister, several other ministers and departmental principal secretaries and officers were present in the meeting
 tathyon ko kaise todaa-maroda jaataa he,aap pradhanmantri se sikh sakate hai
 i call them sheer lies, because they are specially designed and then spoken at rallies
 gujarat chunaavon ke samay manishankar ayyar ke ghar kii baithak vaala bayaan bhi isi shrenee kaa tha,jise lekar baad main rajyasabha main chupchaap maafee maangi gai thi
 Referring to the incident of 1948, it is clear that the team must have given out all the facts, then a lie would have been made on the basis of those facts
 karnataka ke kalburgi main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki field marshall keem kariappa or general ke thimayya kaa congress sarkaar ne apmaan kiya tha
 This is a historical fact
 general thimayya ke netritv main hamane1948kii ladaai jiti thi
 The man who saved Kashmir was insulted by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Defense Minister Krishna Menon
 kya apmaan kiya,kaise apmaan kiya,is par kuch nahin kaha
 The General of the Indian Army in the Battle of 1947–48 was Sir Francis Butcher, not General Thimyya
 yuddh ke dauraan general thimayya kashmir main sena ke oparation kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Became Chief of Army Staff in 1957
 1959main general thimayya senadhyaksh the
 At the time, Defense Minister Krishna Menon refused to accept his opinion about China's military mobilization
 iske baad general thimayya ne istife kii peshkash kar di,jise pradhanmantri nehru ne asweekaar kar diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi knows that the media will report these things to him
 kuch website par sahi baat chap bhi jaaegi,to kya fark padegaa,magar karnataka kii janata to in baton se bahak jaaegi
 Should we not worry that the Prime Minister of India lies even to mislead the public
 
 
 ? There has been constant criticism that the BJP has given tickets to seven members of the Reddy brothers of Bellary
 koi inhen manch par bulaata he to koi inhen dur rakhata he
 Amit Shah abstains from Reddy brothers, Reddy brothers are campaigning for BJP
 yediurpparindian Expressse kehete hai ki amit shah kaa faisla tha
 Now the Prime Minister went to Bellary
 reddy bandhuon ke khilaaf avaidh khanan ke tamaam maamle chal rahe hai
 The Prime Minister was also being criticized for this
 jinke abhiyaan kii shuruyaat'na khaauungaa na khaane duungaa'se hui thi,vahi pradhanmantri ab reddy bandhuon kaa bachaav kar rahe hai
 Going to Bellary, he uses his speech art (?)
 baat ko kaise ghumaate hai,aap khud dekhie
 It is said that Congress has insulted Bellary
 congress kahati he ki bellari main chor or lutere rahete hai
 Whereas during the Vijayanagaram empire between the 14th and 17th centuries, there was 'good Governance'
 bhala ho pradhanmantri kaa,jinhone vijaynagaram ke mahaan daur koyeebhjhfsarkaar kaa daur nahin kaha
 But with what cunning and ability he defended the Reddy brothers of Bellary
 vah bellari kii janata ke apmaan ke bahaane reddy bandhuon kaa khuleam bachaav kar gaye
 Applause
 pehali baar pradhanmantri ne reddy bandhuon ko clin chit de di he
 Now CBI will also remain silent

 If the orange is not sold in a week, the entire crop will fall to the ground and be ruined
 30 saal pehle ilaake main santara kheti kii shruwaat hui jiskaa paudha nagpur maharashtra se laayaa gaya tha
 The soil and environment of this region is suitable for orange cultivation, due to which its production is so high
 abhi tak sarkaar ne aisa kii qadam nahi uthaaya jisase santara kisaanon ko phayda mil sake
 This is the third consecutive year in which orange farmers are suffering heavy losses
 saal 2015 main kisaanon ko santara sadak par fankna padaa tha tab bhav pachaas paise kilo bhi nahi mil paaya tha
 The crop was destroyed in 2016 by hailstorm and this year the price is back on the ground

 Seeing the flowering of the orange orchards, the merchant buys the advance cash, but this time due to demonetization in November, the advance deals were not done
 kisaanon ke bageeche nahi bike jiskaa sidhaa asar ab dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Orange farming started in the area 30 years ago, whose plant was brought from Nagpur Maharashtra
 is kshetra kii mitti or paryaavaran santara kheti ke liye upyukt he jisaki vajah se iskaa utpaadan itnaa adhik hota he
 So far, the government has not taken such a step so that the orange farmers can benefit
 yah lagaataar teesraa saal he jisame santara kisaan baari nuksaan uthaa rahe hai
 In 2015, farmers had to throw orange on the road, then the price could not get even fifty paisa a kilo
 2016 main ola vrishti se fasal nasht ho gai thi or is saal waapas bhav jameen par he
 The comments saamanyata bada kisaan hi santara kheti karata he kyonki iskaa kharch bahut mahangaa he
 Apart from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, there is a huge demand and supply of oranges here in Bangladesh
 notebandi kaa sidhaa asar is par hua he kyonki yah puri tarah se nagad main bikne vaali fasal he
 It is a crop that comes twice a year

 Flowering starts in the crop coming in february-march from the month of August and its deals in november-december
 santara ke bageeche flowering dekhakar advance nagdi dekar vyapaaree kharid letaa he lekin is baar navambar main notebandi kii vajah se advance saude nahi hue
 Farmers' gardens were not sold, which is now directly visible

 '' mithun chakravarti ke bete mahakshay kii shaadi 7 july ko 'yas bos' fame actress shila sharma kii beti madalsa sharma se hone ja rahi he
 However, after the FIR was lodged in the rape case against the superintendent recently, there was some apprehension about the marriage
 lekin ab khud shila sharma ne ek bayaan main saaf kar diya ki unki beti kii shaadi tay taarikh par hi hogi
 Mithun's son accused of rape, married to daughter of actress, Sheila said to Spotboy, "it (marriage) will be on July 7 only
 mimoh usase (shikayatakarta se) saal 2015 main mila tha or hamen pehle se hi is baat kii puri jaankaree he
 Rather Mimoh has also complained about this to create problems
 ab vah inkaar kyon kar rahi he jab shaadi ko sirf kuch hi din baaki rah gaye hai? usne ection lene ke liye itnaa lanbaa intjaar kyon kiya? sabakaa ek ateet hota he or ham sach jaanate hai

 agar aap sochate hai ki shaakaahaar kii avadharana sirf manushyon main he to aap bilkul galat hai, kyonki ek taaja adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki kuch kitbhakshi paudhe bhi shaakaahaar ko apana rahe hai
 The bladderwort plants of the Eutricularia species are insectivorous plant species that feed on small insects
 nae adhyayan se haalanki pataa chalaa he ki ab ye paudhe santulit poshan ke liye shaiwal or pargon kaa seven karne lage hai
 These plants catch their prey with lightning fast by suckling organs and close the doors to prevent them from escaping
 ek baar funs jane ke baad keet dam ghut jane se mar jate hai, jiske baad paudhe unhen anzime ke rup main vighatit kar pachaa jate hai
 Before adopting vegetarianism, this was the same process of taking food of these plants

 When pests are taken as food, the plants get huge amounts of nitrogen which increases the growth of hibernation organs in the plants and which is helpful in keeping the plants alive in extremely cold weather
 ayodhya main jahaan ramalala mandir nirmaan kii baat joh rahe hai, vahiin raipur se 30 kilometre dur apane nanihaal main bhagwaan ram pichley 21 varshon se taale main band hai
 Actually, Lord Ram's temple is locked here due to the ongoing battle between the two families over the hegemony
 dakshin kosal kii rajdhani aarang ke sameep lagbhag chaar hajaar kii aabaadi vaale gaanv chandkhuri ko ayodhya ke raja dasharath kii sabase badi rani kaushalya kaa janmasthal mana jaataa he
 Once in this village with 126 ponds, there is a temple of Kaushalya Mata in the center of the reservoir called Jalsen, where Lord Rama sits in Kaushalya's lap
 vishwa main kaushalya mata kaa yah ekmaatr mandir he
 Due to the maternal uncle of Mata Kaushalya, this village is considered to be a child of Lord Rama
 gaanv ke madhya main bhagwaan ram kaa mandir he jo pichley 21 varshon se band he
 The reason for this is the ongoing dispute between two families over the ownership of the temple
 mandir ke praangan main bane ghar main nivas karne vaale sharma parivaar kii mukhiya or gaanv kii sarpanch indu sharma ke mutabik mandir kaa nirmaan saikadon varsh purv karaayaa gaya tha
 When Sitaram Swami Naidu was Malguzar of Chandkuri village, he appointed Narasimh Prasad Upadhyay, who came here as Ayurvedic doctor in the year 1952, in the service of the temple and entrusted the responsibility of about 28 acres of the land of the temple
 iske kuch samay baad naidu kii mrityu ho gai
 Indu Sharma said that when his brother-in-law and temple priest Narasimh Prasad Upadhyay died in May 1997, the iconic Bais family claimed the temple and land in August and allegedly locked the temple
 tab se yah mandir band he
 He told that since then till now the fight for the right of this temple is going on between the two families
 sarpanch indu sharma chaahati hai ki mandir kaa dwaar khol diya jaae jisase gaanv ke log darshan kar saken
 The Bais family has a different claim about the temple here
 bas parivaar ke mahesh bas kehete hai ki gaanv main jab naidu parivaar kii malgujari thi tab bas parivaar ne unki puri jameen kharidi lee thi
 With which this temple also came under the Bais family
 mandir lagbhag teen sau saal purana he tathaa malgujaar naidu ne is mandir kaa jirnoddhar varsh 1915 main karaayaa tha
 Shyam Bais, a member of the Bais family, says that even after his family came to the temple, the priest Upadhyay's family used to worship at this temple
 lekin pujari kii mrityu ke baad mandir main puja band ho gai
 The temple also got dilapidated due to lack of maintenance and the temple had to be closed to avoid any untoward incident
 mandir kii jameen bhagwaan ram ke naam par he
 Bais says that his family has made a new map of the temple and renovation work will be started soon so that the temple can reopen
 rajya ke puratatvvid doctor hemu yadu kehete hai ki mandir ke gumbad ko dekhte hue lagata he ki mandir kaa nirmaan 17 veen se 18 veen shatabdi ke madhya main karaayaa gaya tha
 This temple is built after the temple of Kaushalya Mata built in the village
 kaushalya mata ke mandir kii sthapaty kala kii drushti se iske nirmaan kaa samay chhathvin shatabdi mana ja saktaa he
 The comments yadu kehete hai ki chhattisgarh ko dakshin kosal kaha jaataa he or ramayana kaal main dakshin kosal ke raja bhaanumant kaa rajya tha
 Whose daughter was Bhanumati (kaushalya)
 dakshin kosal kii rajdhani aarang nagari thi tathaa chandkhuri kaa naam pehle chandrapuri tha jahaan mata kaushalya kaa janm hua tha
 Archaeologists say that since Chhattisgarh is a nephew of Shri Ram, Ram is a nephew of the people of Chhattisgarh
 yahi kaaran he ki yahaan ke nivasee apane bhaanje main bhagwaan ram kii chhavi dekhte hai, tathaa yahaan bhaanje kaa pair chune kaa rivaaj he
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team

 ) mata kaushalya kaa maayka hone ke kaaran is gaanv ko bhagwaan ram kaa nanihaal mana jaataa he
 There is a temple of Lord Rama in the middle of the village which has been closed for the last 21 years
 isaki vajah yahaan do pariwaron ke bich mandir ke malikana haq ko lekar chal rahaa vivaad he
 According to Indu Sharma, the head of the Sharma family and sarpanch of the village, who lived in the house built in the courtyard of the temple, the temple was built hundreds of years ago
 jab seetaram swami naidu chandkhuri gaanv ke malgujaar the tab unhone varsh 1952 main ayurvedic doctor ke rup main yahaan aae narsingh prasad upaadhyaay ko mandir kii seva main niyukt kiya or mandir kii lagbhag 28 acre jameen kii jimmedaari saunpi
 Naidu died shortly thereafter
 indu sharma ne bataaya ki jab may varsh 1997 main unke shvasur tathaa mandir ke pujari narsingh prasad upaadhyaay kii mrityu hui tab agast main yahaan ke pratishthit bas parivaar ne is mandir or jameen par daawa kiya or mandir main kathith rup se taala laga diya
 Since then this temple has been closed
 unhone bataaya ki tab se lekar ab tak is mandir ke haq ke liye donon pariwaron ke madhya ladaai chal rahi he
 Sarpanch Indu Sharma wants the temple door to be opened so that the people of the village can visit
 idhar mandir ko lekar bas parivaar kaa alag daawa he
 Mahesh Bais of the Bais family says that when the Naidu family owned property in the village, the Bais family had bought their entire land
 jiske saath hi yah mandir bhi bas parivaar ke hisse main aa gaya
 The temple is almost three hundred years old and was renovated by Malguzar Naidu in the year 1915
 bas parivaar ke sadsy shyaam bas kehete hai ki unke parivaar ke paas mandir aane ke baad bhi pujari upaadhyaay kaa parivaar is mandir main puja archana karata tha
 But after the death of the priest, worship in the temple ceased
 mandir bhi rakh rakhaav ke abhaav main jeernsheern ho gaya or kisi anhoni se bachane ke liye mandir ko band karnaa padaa
 The land of the temple is named after Lord Rama
 bas kehete hai ki unke parivaar ne mandir kaa nayaa nakshaa bana liya he tathaa jald hi jirnoddhar kaa kaary shuru kiya jayega jisase mandir phir se khul sake
 State's archaeologist Dr
 Hemu Yadu says that looking at the dome of the temple, it seems that the temple was built in the middle of the 17th to 18th century
