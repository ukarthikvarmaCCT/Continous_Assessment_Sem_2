 a student committed suicide by jumping off a bridge in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh
 aatmahatya karti hui chaatra kaa video viral ho gaya he
 The girl hailing from Kullu was a student of a private college in Mandi
 ladki kaa shav abhi tak nahin mila
 Police is busy in search of the dead body
 aatmahatya karne vaali ladki kaa naam diksha he or isaki umr 20 saal he
 The girl came to visit Bilaspur a few days ago and while she was walking on the bridge to commit suicide, some of her boys made a video, which has gone viral
 chashmadid bataate hai ki yah ladki kaaphi samay tak pul par tahal rahi thi or achaanak pul kii diwaar par chadh kar chalaang laga di
 Although some people saw the girl climbing the bridge wall, they ran to save her, but before that the girl jumped
 nadi main pani zyada hone ke chalate lakdi kaa shav nahin mil paaya he, jabaki yah maamla 16 june kaa he, police ko abhi tak ladki kaa shav nahin mil paaya he
 Due to the high water in the river and the rapid flow of the river, the police have to struggle hard
 abhi tak ladki ke aatmahatya karne ke kaarnon kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he or police maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi he
 There have been many cases of suicide from this bridge

 Head of All World Gayatri Parivar Shantikunj, Dr
 pranav pandya ko congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii shakl acchhee nahin lagati he isliye ve unase milanaa nahin chaahate hai
 If Rahul comes to meet him here, he will meet him as if he met a common man
 ve rahul kaa khaas swaagat nahin karenge jaisaa unhone bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh kaa kiya tha
 Rather, they want that if Rahul Gandhi comes to meet them, like everyone else, they too meet him in line
 gauratlab he ki gayatri parivaar pramukh ke bhaajapa adhyaksh ko samarthan na dene kii baat saamne aane par ye mana ja rahaa tha ki jald hi congress ke dhurandhar unase sampark saadhane kii koshish karenge
 After all, the question is directly related to 15 crore and indirectly about 25 crore people and both big parties have their eyes set on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections of 2019 as a vote bank to all members of this family
 
 aise main ye mana ja rahaa tha ki jald hi congress adhyaksh gayatri parivaar pramukh se mulaaqaat kaa kaarykram bhi bana sakate hai
 Perhaps this may not be possible now, the kind of statement that Pandya has given today, at least after that, it can be considered
 mohan bhagwat ne dur kii naaraazgi?pandya ne bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa shaantikunj main swaagat kiya tha magar jab amit shah ne 2019 ke chunaav ke liye saport maanga to saport karne kaa aashwaasan na dekar unhone kaha tha ki wo fatwa jari nahin karenge
 Will give a message to his supporters to vote on the basis of discretion in support of BJP
 magar aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat se milane ke baad unke sur na keval bhaajapa ke liye badal gaye balki unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko lekar vivaadit bayaan de diya he
 With this the message is now going on that their resentment towards the BJP has ended
 gayatri parivaar pramukh pandya ke kehane par karodon log vot kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, BJP could not let Pandya stay angry for much longer
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki mohan bhagwat vishesh rup se gayatri parivaar pramukh se mili, jiske baad unki naaraazgi ab dur hoti dikhaai de rahi he
 Regarding the works of Asthanamami Gange Project towards Maa Ganga, Pandya said that even if we do a tie-up, we do not expect any kind of financial support
 bina apeksha ke puraa sahyog karte hai
 Will still do, where the big factory is, their waste goes
 paryaavaran ke liye janchetana ko jaagrath karnaa hoga or is kaary ko ham sabko milakar karnaa hoga
 Ram temple case is in court

 The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisory to all states and union territories to identify Rohingya Muslims living illegally
 ab bharat me avaidh tareeke se rah rahe rohingya kii pahchaan kar baahar nikaala jaae
 The advisory also mentions the threat from Rohigya Muslims
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se myanmar main rohingya muslimon kaa mudda uthaane ke baad yah adwijuri saamne ai he
 According to sources, terrorist organizations can use Rohingya Muslims in terrorist incidents against India
 vartmaan main bharat me avaidh tareeke se samay 40 hazaar rohingya alag alag rajyon main rah rahe hai
 It is being told that Rohingya Muslims are mostly living in Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi NCR and Rajasthan
 bharat main sabase zyada ronhigya muslim jammu main based hai, yahaan kareeb 10,000 ronhigya muslim rahete hai
 The biggest question in front of the Government of India is more than the livelihood of 40 thousand Rohingya Muslims, which is of paramount importance
 sarkaar ko roti, kapadaa or makaan kii dikkaton se jujhate rohingya aabaadi ke aatanki sanghathanon ke jhaanse main aasaani se aa jane kii ashanka he
 The government has also received such intelligence inputs that the terror groups operating from Pakistan have been engaged in a conspiracy to take them into their clutches
 aise main sarkaar bharat main sharan le chuke 40 hajaar rohingya sharnaarthiyon ko 40 hajaar barood ke dher ke sambhavit khatre ke taur par dekh rahi he
 After all, who are Rohingya Muslims? The Rohingya Muslim community of Myanmar is considered as the most oppressed minority community in the world
 rohingya sunni muslim hai, jo bangladesh ke chatgaanv main prachlit bangla bolte hai
 No country is ready to adopt Rohingya Muslims who have been deposed in their own country
 myanmar khud unhen apana naagarik nahin maanata
 The Rohingya population in Myanmar is close to 1 million
 sanyukt raashtra ke mutabik kareeb itani hi sankhya main rohingya bangladesh, bharat, pakistan sahit purvi asia ke kai deshon main sharan liye hue hai
 The Rohingya community settled in the Rakhine area of myanmar in the early 15th century, but the local Buddhist majority community has not adopted them till date
 myanmar main sainya shashan aane ke baad rohingya samudaay ke saamaajik bahishkaar ko baqayada raajnneetik faisle kaa rup de diya gaya or unase naagarikta chin lee gai
 Following the killing of some security personnel in Rakhine in 2012, widespread rioting broke out between the Rohingya and the Buddhists
 tab se myanmar main rohingya samudaay ke khilaaf hinsa jari he

 Answer the question rail coach factory kaa matlab kya he? swaabhaavik he, vah kaarkaana jahaan rail ke dibbon kaa nirmaan hota ho
 But by applying this straight answer to Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory, you can be proved wrong
 asal main 7 november ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne apane sansadeey kshetra raibareli main jis rail coach factory kaa locarpan kiya, vahaan par rail coach banane kaa koi kaarkaana abhi tak nahin laga he
 Here, all the goods are being brought to Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory 900 km away from Kapurthala Rail Coach Factory and it is being molded into a Rail Coach and all the workers and contractors from Kapurthala to Rae Bareli are doing it
 541 hectare main faili raibareli rail coach factory kaa nirmaan march, 2009 main shuru hua, lekin teen varsh se zyada samay bitne ke baad abhi tak factory kaa pehla charan hi puraa hua he
 The coaches which could be easily produced in Kapurthala factory were brought to Rae Bareli from there and the cost was increased by adding 900 km of unreasonable transportation expenses, allowances of employees, contractual expenses
 raibareli rail coach factory se jude ek adhikari sweekaarte hai ki saamaanya taur par ek coach taiyaar karne main 2
 50 crores Rs
 kaa kharch aata he, lekin kapoorthala se raibareli laakar coach ko taiyaar karne main keemat main 10-15 fisadi kaa ijapha ho rahaa he
 While Anil Handa, chief administration officer of the Rae Bareli factory, says, "only bare shells come from Kapurthala, while the entire work of flooring, glass, windows and berth fittings, wiring, furnishing and air conditioning is done here
" ”vahiin duusari ore kapoorthala coach factory ke general manager bi

 rajasekhar kehete hai, ''jab bhi kori nai factory sthapit hoti he to use sahyog diya jaataa he
 When the Kapurthala factory was also built, parts came from Germany
 ”bhartiya rail kii production unit ke taur par teen charnon main raibareli rail coach factory april, 2013 main taiyaar honi thi, iske liye 1,685 karod ru
 There was a provision of budget of
 lekin bhoomi adhigrahan main deree ke chalate ab yah yojana 2014 main puri hogi
 Due to increase in time, the budget of the factory has also increased to Rs 2,500 crore
 ho gaya he
 In the first three years, even though only the coach maintenance machines have been installed in the Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory, but the railway officials claim that within the next six months it will be a 'jig' for the construction of the coach factory here
 Big machines like skin tensing, EOT cranes will also be installed
 philhal kaam kii raftaar ko dekhte hue chah maheene main mashine lagane kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 But the machines which are installed are being questioned by the employees working here
 raibareli rail coach factory main is vakt kul 350 karmchaaree kaam kar rahe hai lekin inamen se 275 karmchaaree kapoorthala rail coach factory se aae hai
 a technical staff working in the coach says that the fitting machines in the Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory are not of the same quality as those in Kapurthala
 ve bataate hai, ''scru, washar, nat-bolt jaise saamaan khatm hone ke baad kapoorthala se inhen mangane main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he” kapoorthala se raibareli rail coach factory main aae karmchaaree yahaan apni seva sambandhi dashaon se bhi naakhush hai
 In January 2012, 50 employees who now come to Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory have not received a single increment
 do maah ke bheetar 40 takneekee karmchaariyon ne waapas kapoorthala rail coach factory main tainaat kiye jane ke liye prarthana patr diya he
 Not satisfied are those who gave their land for Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory

 Jagatpal, who lives in Yusufpur, says that while taking the land, the officers promised to give jobs to one member of each family, but in the first phase, none of the 136 people who are getting jobs will be posted in Rae Bareli
 factory ke adhikari aadhikarik taur se kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin
 An official, on the condition of anonymity, says that the villagers had promised him a job in the Indian Railways, which he considered a Rae Bareli coach factory
 rail coach factory kii aniyamittaaon ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale bispi netaa or raibareli sansadeey kshetra se pratyaashee ramlakhan paasi kehete hai, ''yah factory raibareli ke logon ko rojgaar nahin degi
 Nor will it buy any goods from the factories here
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle janata ko bargalane ke liye yah dhokhadhadi he
 It can also be a case related to corruption
 ” raibareli ke udyogpati or indian industries association ke sansthaapak sadsy pradeep aaazaad bataate hai ki rail coach factory tabhi safal hogi jab yahaan kaam aane vaala saamaan raibareli ke udyogon se hi taiyaar karaayaa jaae
 This will reduce expenses otherwise in the coming days another name will be added to Rae Bareli's list of closed factories

 congress sarkaar jameen adhigrahan bill lekar ai thi, lekin narendra modi ne vipaksh main rahete hue iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Rahul said that the price of paddy is low here, but where the Congress government is there, farmers are getting full price

 Asked whether the state would be developed on the lines of Bihar and Gujarat, Yadav said that no state in the country is ideal for us

 Arvind Kejriwal's old partner Yogendra Yadav has described the 5th anniversary of the Aam Aadmi Party as a beautiful and auspicious occasion
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet karte hue yadav ne andolan ke din yaad kiye or raajnneetik dal ke taur par janalokapal kanoon, bhrashtachar mukt dilli par sawaal bhi daage hai
 Yogendra Yadav said that the spirit of Janlokpal was a resolve to fight corruption
 uske saath baaki partiyon ne dhokhaa kiya, samaj aata he
 The Congress did not let the implementation, the BJP did not appoint the Lokpal till date after coming to power
 lekin, afsos yah he ki aam aadmi party ne bhi yahi kiya
 Counting the lack of a Jan Lokpal bill passed in the Delhi Assembly, Yadav said that the Lokpal bill that the Aam Aadmi Party government itself made was even weaker than the bjp's Lokpal bill made in Uttarakhand
 jaanboojhkar us bill main is tarah ke pench daale gaye ki kanoon bane hi na
 By doing this kind of game, the outsiders had cheated, as well as those who raised the flag of Janlokpal have also cheated
 aage yogendra yadav bataate hai ki ramlila maidan main janalokapal kii nunatam maang thi ki uski niyukti kaa tarika sarkaar ke dawaab se swatantra ho
 But none of these things appeared in this bill
 centre sarkaar agar bahaane banaaye ki rajya sarkaar ke adhikaar se baahar tab bhi samaj aata he lekin isamen pench daal diya gaya he ki koi bhi mantri yaa pradhanmantri tak iske daayre main aaenge, jise koi sarkaar sweekaar nahin karegi
 On the claim of Aam Aadmi Party to reduce corruption in Delhi, Yadav clearly said that if a government had reduced corruption then it would have been a big deal but after that the elections of MCD were held which everyone saw
 dilli kii janata aisi nahin he ki jis sarkaar ne bhrashtachar kam kar diya ho use chunaav main haraa de or emsidi se baahar nikaal de
 Yogendra Yadav believes that today the Aam Aadmi Party has started on the path of other parties and if questions are being asked from this party then it is a victory of the people
 5 saal main loktantr kii uplabdhi yahi he ki jo sawaal yah shila dikshit se poochhate the usase zyada ab janata inase sawaal kar rahi he
 Recalling the journey of 5 years, Yogendra Yadav compared the Aam Aadmi Party born with the movement to a soul
 unhone kaha ki yah mauka he us ghatana ko yaad karne kaa jab loktantr ne nai angadaai lee he
 Lakhs of people came on the road and took a pledge that they can change politics and control big parties
 mere liye wo aatma zyada jaruri he bajaay us kaaya ke joam aadmi partike naam se chal rahi he
 If the party's soul survives, it will find a new body, and it remains my concern

 lekin is badi yojana ke liye ab bhi bajet kaaphi kam he or desh kii aabaadi kaa bada hissaa iske laabh se vanchit he
 So this time everyone will keep an eye on what announcements about Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Ayushman
 kya iskaa bajet badhegaa? kya yojana kaa dayera badhaakar isamen madhyam varg ke garib logon ko bhi shaamil kiya ja sakegaa? in sabakaa jawaab 5 july ko milegaa, jab vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman bajet pesh karengi

 Therefore, it cannot be possible to establish this comprehensive infrastructure in such a low budget
 iske liye baari bajet kii jarurat he or is bajet aavanton main ho rahi deree se yojana kaa phayda sabhi labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane main bhi kaaphi deree hogi
 Will the scope be increased? It is also being demanded that the scheme should be expanded to include the lower middle class as well, which has largely voted for the BJP
 is yojana kaa dayera badhaane kii kuch had tak koshish bhi shuru kii gai he
 Some states have taken initiative for this

 In many places it is tried to make such a scheme, in which medical facilities can be provided to 75% of the population of the district under a single scheme
 ab dekhnaa he ki vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman is bare main kya ghoshnaaen karti hai
 What is this scheme? The objective of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana is to provide health cover to the economically weaker person
 is yojana kaa makasad har aarthik taur par kamjor shaks ko behatar swasthya seva dena he
 Under this scheme, your hospital expenses, day care surgery, follow-up care, treatment before and after hospitalization, newborn health check-up and services will be available

 74 crore families will get

 He said that India believes in 'we and our' concept
 videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘jab raashtrapati trump ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main kaha ki unka naaraa ‘pehle main’ he, to main dukhi hui
 'she was referring to Trump's speech to the United Nations in September last year in which she said,' As an American President, i will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your country will always put their country first
 And they should also put the country first

 jivan ke gudh rahasyon main se ek rahasy kaa khulaasa karte hue avivaahit udyogpati ratan tata ne kaha ki unhen bhi pyaar hua tha or vah chaar baar shaadi ke bandhan main bandhane se chuke
 In an interview to a TV channel, Tata said, but thinking remotely, he felt it was okay for her to be single, because if she had married, the situation would have been quite complicated
 unhone kaha, agar aap puuchhen ki kya maine kabhi dil lagaaya tha, to aapako bataa duun ki main chaar baar shaadi karne ke liye gambhir hua or har baar kisi na kisi dar se main peeche hat gaya
 Talking about his days of love, Tata said, "when i was working in America, i probably became very serious about love and we couldn't get married only because i came back to India
" yah puche jane par ki jinase unhen pyaar hua tha, kya ve ab bhi shahar main hai, unhone haa main jawaab diya, lekin is maamle main aage bataane se inkaar kiya
 Ratan Tata, who is heading the empire of around 100 companies of the Tata group, also said that his successor would be chosen by the middle of this year and his half-brother is also a candidate in the race
 ratan tata ne kaha, mujhe ummid he ki is saal kii pehali chamahi main, ham upyukt ummidavaar kaa chayan kar lenge or is dauraan sevanivrutt hone se pehle main kuch samay unke saath beetaa sakuunga
 73-year-old Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, will retire at the age of 75 in December 2012 as Tata Group head
 unka sthaan lene ke liye pichley saal agast main upyukt ummidavaar kii khoj ke liye ek team gathit kii gai thi
 How likely is it that the next chairman of the Tata group is a person whose name is not associated with Tata, Ratan Tata said that he would not like to answer this question

 ab madhya pradesh main chunaav ayog kii anumati ke bagaiyr afasaron ke tabadale nahin ho sakenge
 State Chief Electoral Officer VL Kanta Rao said that no officer will be transferred after December 26 without the permission of the Election Commission
 aisa isliye kaha ja rahaa he kyonki aane vaale kuch dinon main loksabhaa chunaav hai
 Due to this, transfers of officers engaged in election work will not be done without the permission of Election Commission
 mukhya nirvachan padaadhikari ve el kanta raav ne aage bataaya ki jila nirvachan adhikari, nirvaachak registrikaran adhikari, sahaayak nirvaachak registrikaran adhikari kaa sthanantaran rajya shashan ke dwaara nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 For this, permission has to be obtained from the Election Commission
 iske baad hi kisi bhi afasar kaa sthanantaran ho sakegaa
 Kamal Nath had made a quick transfer of officers as soon as the government was formed
 
 
 
 Significantly, soon after becoming the Chief Minister, Kamal Nath had taken a decisive decision and issued orders for transfer of a total of 42 officers, including collectors of 26 districts
 is kram main unhone apane sansadeey kshetra chhindwara ke dm kaa bhi tabadalaa kar diya tha
 Sources say that in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Chief Minister Kamal Nath has dropped the transfer of the officers only on the Shivraj government
 aapako bataa den ki is tabadale ke sanket kamalnath pehle bhi kai baar chunaav prachaar ke dauraan de chuke the

 5% are female students - unable to pursue higher education due to poverty
 aise main yah samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki chaatr or mata-pita sabase achche sansthaanon kii taak main kyon rahete hai
 It has also been the biggest driving force behind the India Today Group's annual college survey — to help students decide on the best colleges
 yah silsilaa 1997 main shuru hua tha or beete do dashak se zyada vakt main yah lagaataar viksit hone kii prakriya se gujara he
 It has been a constant endeavor to make it better and the method of evaluation more valuable
 sarvshereshth collejon kaa survey ab apane 22wein saal main he or is viraasat ko aage badhaate hue hamane apni paddati main kuch badlaav kiye hai (saath kaa pej dekhen)
 We have assigned this task to the new agency — the Delhi-based Marketing and Development Research Association (MDRA) —and added three new streams: Architecture, Dental or Dentistry and Social Work (in previous surveys we considered only institutions offering masters courses did)
 hamaare pichley avatar main dharnatmak or tathyaatmak ankon ko baraabar vajan (50rou50) diya gaya tha
 Over the course of so many years, we felt that sorting the colleges in the first phase on a notional basis was unfair with the emerging colleges which in the perception could not score higher than the traditional giants
 lihaaja is saal ham apni paddati main ek bada badlaav laae hai
 After preparing a list of colleges from many sources, we asked for factual data from them and at the same time sent the list to the experts to give the concept points
 collejon se mili tathyaatmak data kii gaharaai se chaanbin kii gai
 The final ranking was based on factual and inferential scores — 60 percent weight was given to factual data and 40 percent weight was given to notional marks
 is badlaav—yani pehali paaydaan par visheshgyon kii dharna ke aadhaar par collejon ko nahin chhaantane—kii vajah se bahut zyada badi taadaad main collejon ne is prakriya main hissaa liya (pichley saal ke 259 ke mukaable is baar kareeb 1,000 college)
 The result was that several new contenders emerged in the top 20 colleges in various streams
 badali hui paddati kaa takaza yah bhi tha ki ham ranking kii pichley saalon se tulana na karen
 The most significant decline has come in engineering, which is an example of contradiction in itself
 is dhara main iity kii shakl main duniya ke kuch sabase achche santhaan shumaar hai, jabaki duusari taraf desh bhar ke saikadon ejineering college kabhi lalachaai najaron se dekhi jane vaali apni siton ko bharne main naakaam rahe hai

 3 lakh siten kam karne ke liye eysitii se guhaar lagaai he
 According to the interim figures of AICTE, 83 engineering institutes with 24,000 seats have applied for closure
 iske alaava 494 collejon ne kuch program band karne kii ijaajat maangi he
 This will reduce the national filing by 42,000 seats
 nijee shiksha kii ahmiyat or ubhaar keval ejineering collejon tak simit nahin he
 According to the HRD Ministry, 77
 8 fisadi collejon kaa prabandh nijee haathon main he (jinamein se 64
 2 per cent private-aided and 13 per cent
 6 fisadi privet-sahaayta praapt college hai)
 The imbalance however lies in the fact that private colleges total 67
 3 fisadi namakanon kii jaruraton ko puraa karte hai
 Government colleges are still carrying more burden than capacity
 hamaare survey ne shiksha kii oonchi laagat ko lekar faili ashankaon ko bhi dhyaan se parkhaa he
 That is why a new feature has been added — the Return on Investment (ROI) ranking of colleges
 yah aaroai ranking placement ko lekar chaatro ke dar ko dur karne main madad karegi or saath hi unhen is baat ko bhi samajhane main madad karegi ki ve kitni acchhee naukari (tankhwaah ke package ke lihaaj se) kii apeksha kar sakate hai or course kii fees kii tulana main yah kahaan thaharti he
 However ROI rankings do not mean that they are the best colleges
 sarvshereshth collejon ke india today group-emdiare survey 2018 se kuch chintajanak sanket ubharkar aae hai
 Most of the colleges in the top 30 in all streams are confined in the north and south
 purab se sheersh collejon kii taadaad niraashajanak had tak kam he
 This justifies the results of the All India Survey 2016-17 on Higher Education published this January
 jahaan collejon kaa ghanatv—yani prati lakh yogya aabaadi par collejon kii taadaad—telugana (59) main sabase zyada he or uske baad karnataka (53) kaa number he, vahiin bihar, jharkhand or pashchim bengal is fehrist main sabase nichali paaydaanon par hai
 The national average is 28
 aaj ucch shiksha main hamaara sakal namakan anupaat (jiiaar) mahaj 25
 2 per cent (up from 10 per cent in 2004), while it is 86 per cent in the US and 43 per cent in China
 paanch main se ek college main namakan kaa aankada mahaj 100 chaatro se bhi kam kaa he, jabaki 4 fisadi collejon main 3,000 se zyada namakan hue hai
 Although the country is aiming for a GER target of 30 per cent by 2020, it will lag behind global forces by a huge margin
 aage kaa rasta yahi he ki sarkaar gunvattta prabandhan par zyada kadai se dhyaan dete hue shiksha par zyada kharch kare
 This comparison will prove to be an eye-opener, and a sense of the urgency and importance of the country, which is very much needed in this field
 jaraa is baat par gaur kijieh saal 2016-17 main avasaron kii kami ke chalate 1,90,000 hindustani chaatro ne america collejon main 44,000 karod ru
 The amount spent us saal ucch shiksha ke liye centre sarkaar kaa bajet 30,000 karod rupye se bhi kam tha

 Asked Bala Prasad why revenue is so low? Prasad argued that Rs 950 crore from Indian Oil Corporation
 kii jo apratyaashit aamadani hone vaali thi, vah kanoonee pachadon kii vajah se rajya ke khajaane main nahin pahunchi
 Nitish dismissed this argument and asked, "did we set a target of Rs 950 crore coming from Indian Oil?" bhi hisaab main rakhe the? agar nahin to phir lakshya main kami kii baat karte samay iskaa zikr kyon aayaa? achaanak hone vaale windfall (apratyaashit laabh) ko pehle se to yojana main nahin joda jaataa na
 Nitish's voice was not loud, but the arguments were irrefutable
 may, 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav main party kii khasta haalat ke baad istipha dekar bhale ve satta se baahar rahe par vibhaagon kaa chittha unhen adhiktar sachivon se behatar yaad he or ve saare bahaanon kaa sach pard sakate hai
 Hours after that meeting, when the Bihar General Administration Department issued orders for the transfer of 22 government officials on Tuesday under the direct control of the Chief Minister, both Pankaj Kumar and Bala Prasad had names in them
 22 farvari ko chauthi baar mukhyamantri pad sanbhaalane ke baad nitish bahut jaldi main hai
 Not even a week has been spent that they are busy working hard
 nai pari shuru karne ke ek hi din baad nitish ne pradhan sachivon or sachivon sahit 22 iees adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya or apane kareebi maane jane vaale afasaron ko jaruri kaam saunp die
 He spoke to district officials and superintendents of police through video conferencing and warned that they would not be spared if there was even a slight relaxation in law and order
 isse pehle aksar nitish par afasarshahon kaa paksh lene kii tohamat lagati rahi he par is baar lagata he ki ve thaan kar aae hai ki agar baabuon ne nattejey nahin die to sajaa bhugtenge
 Nitish has more than seven months till the next assembly election scheduled in october-november this year, but he has given his trusted officers till June 15 to complete the project and give concrete results
 2006 main jab nitish ne mukhyamantri kii kursi par apana pehla kaarykaal shuru hi kiya tha, tabhi unhone aparaadh par lagaam kasne ke liye mukademon kii teji se sunwaayee kaa silsilaa shuru kiya tha
 This system was also successful
 2006 se 2011 tak 56,000 se adhik aparaadhiyon ko sajaa hui thi
 But this system, which initially reduced the crime rate, was subsequently relaxed
 is baar nitish 2006-2007 ke kaam ke dhuni avatar main adhik lagate hai
 They are quite different from the image of 2013-2014 when the burden of social engineering concerns on the shoulders of the Chief Minister was seen as excessive
 ve jaanate hai ki soshal ejineering ke mukaable sushasan unhen kahin zyada vot dilaa saktaa he
 Nitish seems to have learned his lesson
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke prati unki naapsandgi ke gaayab hone kaa sanket tab mila jab mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithte hi nitish ne kaha, ''hamaari rajnatik gatividhiyaan jari rahengi
 Political issues will arise from political forums
 unka asar prashasan par nahin padegaa
 i will work with the Prime Minister in the interest of Bihar
 '' jabaki nitish 2009 se modi se milane se bachate rahe hai
 In June 2013, Modi was disbanded after being handed over the command of BJP campaign committee chief
 tab se ve modi ke sabase katu aalochakon main ek rahe hai
 a senior JD (U) leader admitted, "it seems, Nitish has understood that the more criticism of Modi and secularism is communicated, the more polarization will be in favor of the BJP
" '' lagata he, nitish ne maanjhi se bhi takaraav mol na lene kaa faisla kiya he
 Nitish is largely credited for the improved condition in the field of roads, education, electricity and health
 in sabase unka kad kai inch badha he
 But after the break with the BJP in June 2013, the zeal began to wane and Nitish was busy competing to prove himself more secular than Lalu
 prashasan apane lakshya se bhatak gaya or may 2014 main jab nitish ne maanjhi ko apana uttaradhikari banaaya tab to haalat or bighad gai
 The crop of narrow casteist politics in Bihar once again came under discussion for its changing picture
 is baar nitish hawa kaa rukh palatnaa chaahate hai or kuch thos karnaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, BJP is sweating with Manjhi to make a disorganized alliance of upper castes
 maanjhi bhi apane sangrakshak jagannatha mishra ke saath bhavishya kii ranneeti bana rahe hai
 Both are in the world of how to create such a new caste nexus by mixing Brahmins and Dalits to stop the policy

 america ke nirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump dwaara namit mukhya ranneetikaar steve binan ne 2014 main narendra modi ke bharat kaa pradhanmantri nirvaachit hone ko maujuuda tantra ke khilaaf ek 'vaishvik vidroh' kaa hissaa bataaya tha
 Bannon told Vatican City viewers in 2014 via video chat service 'skype', 'I think you will see this in Latin America, i think you will see it in Asia as well, i think you will already be in India Have seen this 'tippaniyan According to a transcript of the conversation released by the news site 'bajfeed', he said, "modi's stunning victory is based on the principles of Reagan (former US President Ronald Reagan), so i think it's a global revolt and we are very lucky and We are proud that we are the news site which is giving this news all over the world
 ' (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) binan ne 2014 main video chat seva 'skip' ke jariye vatican city ke darshakon se kaha tha, 'mujhe lagata he ki aap latin america main aisa dekhenge, mujhe lagata he ki asia main bhi dekhenge, mujhe lagata he ki aap bharat main pehle hi yah dekh chuke hai
 Comments samachar site 'bajfid' dwaara jari baatcheet kii pratilipi ke anusaar, unhone kaha, 'modi kii shandaar jeet reagan (purv america raashtrapati ronald reagan) ke siddhanton par aadhaarit he, isliye mujhe lagata he ki yah ek vaishvik vidroh he or ham behad khushkismat evam gauravanvit hai ki ham vah news site hai jo puri duniya main yah khabar de rahe hai

 ) Keshav Prasad Maurya, Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Government, returned to Lucknow on 12 November in New Delhi with a long marathon departmental meeting with Cabinet Minister Nitin Gadkari of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the Government of India
 upi main haalanki rajya sarkaar apane state hive par koi toll to nahin vasuulati lekin jald hi in sadakon par bhi toll booth dikhaai padane lagenge
 The government has made up its mind to collect toll on the state highway from commercial vehicles only
 keshav maury ne 13 disambar kii dopaher lakhanu ke kalidaas maarg sthit apane awaas par‘india today’se baatcheet kii
 Your government's focus is on Ayodhya
 lakhanu-gorakhpur hive ko chhodkar anya jilon se ayodhya aane vaali sadaken apekshaakrit sankari hai?chaahe vah lakhanu se ayodhya ko jodne vaala maarg ho yaa phir gonda, basti, ambedkarnagar, barabanki se jodne kaa maarg ho, inke vikaas kii ek yojana ‘84 kosi parikrama maarg’ centre sarkaar se sweekrut he
 This will be the four lane route
 ise tej gati se nirmaan karakar jald hi puraa karaayaa jayega
 Apart from this, it has been decided to construct a 300-km long four-lane Ram Vanagam Marg from Ayodhya to Chitrakoot
 -rajya ke rajmargon kaa rakrakhaav ek chunauti he?rashtriya rajmargon par to toll liya ja rahaa he lekin jitne state hive hai un par koi toll abhi tak nahin liya jaataa he
 The government has decided that along with providing a lot of facilities on the state highway in UP, the toll will also be charged
 yah toll paisanger vaahanon se nahin balki keval kammertial vaahanon se hi vasula jayega
 The income from this will not only repair the state highway, but will also connect the villages with paved roads
 jald hi iskaa prastaav cabinet meeting main laayaa jayega
 Apart from this, the government has also decided to construct 80 new state highways
 inamen se 67 par kaam bhi shuru ho gaya he
 - Your government's campaign to free the roads is not able to leave an impact? On a large scale the roads have been pit-free
 asal main lok nirmaan vibhaag kii sadakon se to gadde hataa die gaye hai lekin yahaan rashtriya rajmarg bhi hai jinaki kai jagahon par haalat kharaab he
 Similarly, the irrigation department has roads
 mandi, vikaas praadhikaran, nagar nigam, jila panchayat jaise alag-alag vibhaagon kii sadaken kharaab hone par inhen thik karne main kaaphi dikkatein aati hai kyonki in vibhaagon ke paas utana bajet nahin hota he
 The government is now preparing an action plan that there should not be any pit in the roads of any department
 yah ek bada nirnay he kyonki puure pradesh main teen lakh pachaas kilometre lambii sadaken hai
 Of these, more than two and a half lakh kilometers of roads are with the Public Works Department
 -bhrashtachar ko lekar mukhyamantri ne lok nirmaan vibhaag ke kuch adhikariyon par karrwai kii thi
 After all, why is the Public Works Department viewed from the perspective of a corrupt department? In previous governments, there was a lot of corruption in the manufacturing departments
 upi main kisi bhi vibhaag kii sadak kharaab ho, jaankaree ke abhaav main dosha lok nirmaan vibhaag par madh diya jaataa he
 To ensure transparency in the department, every year, all the zonal officers of the department investigate and report on other zones
 iske baad ham in sabhi jaanch report ko alag se ek swatantra agency se jaanch karaate hai
 If found guilty, strict action is taken against the people
 gunvattta se koi samjhauta nahin he
 Contracts will be awarded only through e-tendering
 agar koi thekedaar or adhikari mileebhagat karata he to pehle keval thekedaar par hi karrwai hoti thi
 Now, in such cases, the officers have also been equally convicted
 -overloding par puri tarah ankush na lagaae jane sadqon ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa he?overloding ek bahut badi samasya he
 After forming the government, we had taken drastic measures to stop overloading
 shatpratishat overloding roak bhi di thi
 Work was immediately affected by this
 iske baad sarkaar ne kuch shithilataa bhi barti lekin ab overloding ke liye kade kadam uthaae gaye hai
 - Many villages of the state are still untouchable by road? Our government has decided that a village with a population of up to two hundred and fifty hundred meters wide roadside will be connected to the main road
 isse abtak 2000 gaavon ko joda ja chukaa he
 When the BJP government came to power in March 2017, there were 1557 villages with a population of 250 according to the 2001 census, they were not connected to the main roads
 hamanen 1762 kilometre lambii aisi sadaken 1114 karod rupye se banaaya he
 Similarly, according to the 2011 census, a total of 1900 kilometers of roads have been built at a cost of 1315 crores in the villages whose population was 250

 ve un saansadon main se hai, jo is baat se behad hataash hai ki rajnatik partiyon ne vidhaan ke is mandir ko nautanki ke manch main tabdeel kar diya he
 (RLD mlas in UP Legislative Assembly demonstrated against the undressed government) Though the image of Parliament has been falling continuously for the last two decades, but it has reached its lowest level in the 15th Lok Sabha
 dilli sthit think tanks piares legislative research ne sabit kiya he ki yah bharat ke ab tak ke itihaas main sabase badtar loksabhaa he
 There are 74 major bills under consideration and 20 bills were passed in less than five minutes of discussion
 isane sirf 13 fisadi samay vidhaayi kaamkaaj main lagaaya he
 Interestingly, in 2010, mps raised their salaries by 200 per cent, making it the most expensive parliament ever
 1952 se 1957 tak pehali loksabhaa ko ummid or sambhaavna ke pratik ke taur par yaad kiya jayega
 From 1991 to 1996, the 10th Lok Sabha enacted policies that opened India's doors to the world
 apane antim padaav par khadi 15veen loksabhaa ko niskriyata kii murat hi kaha ja saktaa he
 (uproar over bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in Rajya Sabha) Former Union Minister Jaswant Singh is a nine-time MP
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘maine isse badtar loksabhaa kabhi nahin dekhi he or yah baat main apane dil par pathar rakhkar kah rahaa hum
 The Parliament is now less heard and the noise of protest is becoming very loud
 yah hamaare samaaj main pehle se zyada fail chuki uthal-puthal or asantosh kaa bhi pratik he, lekin 15veen loksabhaa ke netritv main bhi bhayankar giravat ai he
 "such debates have been heard within the Lok Sabha, which surprised people and prepared the way for the country in times to come
" 1996 main apni 13 din kii sarkaar ke prati avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kaha tha, ‘‘is janadesh ke peeche 40 saal kaa sangharsh or uthal-puthal he
 We have worked hard for this, we have gone through a tremendous struggle
 janata kaa dil jeeta he
 We have sweated 365 days every year as a party
 ’’ yah bhaashan pehali baar doordarshan par sidhe prasaarit hua tha, jisase saansadon kaa aacharan sidhe logon ke dringroom tak pahunch gaya
 Herds of people everywhere, from the dining table to the water cooler, would talk about this speech
 ram manohar lohia ne 1963 main sansad main us samay hadakamp machaa diya tha, jab unhone ek parchaa likhaa tha ki desh kii adhikansh aabaadi rojaanaa teen aane main guzaara karti he, lekin pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru par rojaanaa 25,000 ru
 Costs
 nehru ne jawaab diya ki yojana ayog ke anusaar, yah rakam 15 aane yani aaj ke ek rupye se kuch kam he
 Lohia demanded a special debate on this and when he stood up to speak, one after the other, several members gave their time to speak to Lohia and they cleverly flashed the figures of the Planning Commission
 aaj waisi bahasein nahin hotin, balki uski jagah ek-duusare ko dhakka dena, thappad maarna or chillaanaa sansadeey aacharan kaa saamaanya-sa dastur ban gaya he
 The extent was reached when an MP from Andhra Pradesh sprayed chili powder on the people around him on 13 February

 (TDP mps tore the bill from the Speaker's desk on 13 February) It is not just a stain on the dignity of Parliament, but the PRS figures show that both the duration and quality of functioning in the House is declining
 1950 ke dashak main bhartiya loksabhaa kii baithak saal main ausatan 127 din chalati thi
 But since 2000, it has been reduced to 72 days on average
 1952 se 1989 tak loksabhaa ne har saal kareeb 65 bill paarit kiye
 Now this number has fallen to about 40 bills annually
 1962 se 1991 tak har loksabhaa ne lagaataar shat-pratishat kaam kiya yani unki baithken nirdhaarit samay ke baad bhi chalin
 Lok Sabha hours are from 11 am to 6 pm and Rajya Sabha is from 11 am to 5 pm, but in the 15th Lok Sabha only 63 per cent work was done
 jaswant singh bataate hai, ‘‘un dinon kii baat alag thi
 i remember that the nationalization bill of Maruti was debated all night and the government had to answer everything
 is loksabhaa main raksha mantralay or videsh niti ke bare main ek bhi sarthak bahes nahin hui
 There was a tradition that whenever the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister went abroad, he used to return and report to Parliament
 ab ve paramparaayen nahin raheen
 "the effect of the stalled functioning in the Parliament is also visible in the states
" washington post ke bharat beuro ke pramukh rah chuke simon denyar ne apni kitaab rog elephant main likhaa he ki arunachal pradesh main 2000 se 2010 ke bich vidhansabha kii baithak ausatan sirf 8 din or haryana main sirf 14 din hui
 What does this collapse indicate? PRS co-founder c

 Madhukar argues that a major reason for this is the anti-defection law passed in 1985
 iske baad saansadon ke liye sadan main taiyaari karke aana jaruri nahin rah gaya he kyonki ve chaahe kuch bhi sochen, unhen party vip kaa paalan karnaa hi hoga
 The second reason is the rise of coalition politics
 choti partiyon kii upasthiti kii vajah se yah andaja laga paanaa naammumkin ho gaya he ki kab koun-sa mudda kaise uthegaa
 The third reason, which has become more relevant recently, is the association of Parliament with national television
 lagaataar prasaaran ke aakarshan main bandhe saansadon ne sadan ko tamaam tarah ke mudde uthaane or siyaasi baaji kaa manch bana daalaa he
 This can be understood from the fact that when the Lok Sabha approved the Telangana Bill on February 18, after the third and long session, it was not broadcast on television
 pehle chaar minute tak loksabhaa tivi ke parde par likhaa rahaa ki sansad kii kaarywahi sthagit he, jabaki vastav main kaarywahi chal rahi thi
 As soon as the news of the broadcast stopped reaching the Opposition mps, they created a ruckus by raising slogans of alleged censorship
 3:04 baje likhakar dikhaaya jane laga ki sidhaa prasaaran jald shuru hoga
 But the live broadcast began an hour later
 loksabhaa sachivalay ne safai di ki takneekee kharabi se prasaaran nahin ho sakaa
 a senior minister says, "earlier every parliamentary debate was discussed in detail in the newspapers, which might have encouraged the mps to express their views
" (15veen loksabhaa ke kul samay kaa mahaj 39 fisadi hi prashnkaal ko diya ja sakaa)televijan samachar ke is daur main sirf unheen khabaron par najar rahati he, jinase sansani paidaa ho
 "now the question arises that how can this deteriorated condition of the Parliament improve and bring it back on track?" The Constitution has entrusted Parliament with the responsibility of keeping an eye on the government, the contrary provision of which is that only the government has the right to call a meeting of Parliament
 piares main jansampark ke mukhiya chakshu roy kehete hai, ‘‘kai anya deshon main agar do tihaai saansadon kii sahmati ho to sansad kaa satr bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 We might also think of making this change
 ’’ 2011 main rajyasabha saansad rajeev chandrashekhar ne pradhanmantri ko isi tarah kaa suzav likhakar bheja tha
 He said that every year, three special sessions of Parliament should be of five days, in which major issues of the country should be debated
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne ab tak uskaa koi jawaab nahin diya he
 Similarly, the anti-defection law can also be amended
 up-raashtrapati suzav de chuke hai ki saansadon ko party kii raay ke anusaar vot tabhi dena chahie, jab sarkaar daanv par ho
 During the debate on other issues they should have the right to vote on their own volition
 2010 main congress saansad manish tiwari ne ek gaiyr-sarkari vidheyak pesh karke samvidhan main isi tarah ke sanshodhan kii maang kii thi
 During the 60-year tenure of Parliament, there has been no attempt to change its functioning
 sach to yah he ki sab jaanate hai kya karnaa chahie, par us sudhaar ke liye rajnatik sankalp yaa sahmati kaa abhaav he
 Meanwhile, the politics of hawks has stalled Parliament
 2012 main tatkaaleen sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne kaha tha ki sansad main har baar baadha padane par dhai lakh ru
 There is a loss per minute

 One of the founders of the Swatantra Party in the 1970s, Pilu Modi was an ardent speaker of Parliament
 indira gandhi sarkaar ne unke bazaar samarthak vichaaron kii vajah se unhen washington kaa agent qaraar diya tha
 The taunts and stems rose to such an extent that he came to Parliament with a large badge on which he wrote, "I am an agent of the CIA
" ’’ adhyaksh ne jab unase baij utaarne ke liye kaha to unhone yah kehete hue use utaar diya, ‘‘ab main siie kaa agent nahin rahaa

 aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmadi ne kaha vah ab bhi rashtramandal khelon ke bos hai jabaki unhone saaf kar diya ki bhrashtachar ke aarope is samay unhen pad chhodane ke liye baadhya nahin kar sakate
 Kalmadi said that successfully organizing the Games is a challenge which he has taken on his shoulder and there is no question of leaving the post because he did not do anything wrong
 unhone is gharna ko bhi galat bataaya ki bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baad unke par katar diye gayi hai
 Asked if he was the bass of the Commonwealth Games after the formation of an empowered committee of government bureaucrats, Kalmadi said, "yes, it is my responsibility to organize the games
 yah jari he
 He said, 'group of Ministers exists
 cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata main sachivon kii samiti hameshaa se thi
 The Prime Minister held the meeting and asked all these committees to be more functional and give more support
 mujhe sarkaar se or adhik samarthan mil rahaa he or main aayojan samiti kaa adhyaksh hum
 "kalmadi said," Michael Fennell, the head of the Commonwealth Games Federation, came and gave a good report
 isliye main halaaton ke kaaran in sabakaa swaagat karata hum
 Allegations of corruption and delay in construction caused a lot of controversy ahead of the Commonwealth Games to be held from October 3 to 14 but Kalmadi said that things are now under control and his team is capable of conducting 'successful and transparent' games
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin pataa ki kyon ye saare abhiyaan shuru hue
 Everything was fine until about 15 days ago
 sabhi videshi mulk kah rahe the ki khel achche honge
 i am ready to face any inquiry after the Games
 ’ kalmadi ne kaha, ‘hamaari taiyaari daanv par he or itane varshon kii kadi mehnat ke baad main is tarah se peeche nahin hatana chahta
 This is why i want to investigate
 ’yah poochne par ki kya aaropon ke bich unke man main istipha dene kaa khyaal aayaa, kalmadi ne kaha, ‘nahin, yah chunauti he jo maine lee he
 When we won the bid, i promised the CGF that we would organize successful games
 isliye is tarah ke vichaar man main aane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Kalmadi, however, said that he had trouble boosting his team's morale following allegations of corruption in the media
 yah poochne par ki kya khelon kaa nakaaratmak prachaar raajnneetik shadyantr kaa hissaa he jise party ke unke saathiyon ne khadaa kiya he, kalmadi ne kaha, ‘main kuch nahin kahana chahta, unhen kehane dijie
 i do not want to react
 main sunishchit karuunga ki khelon kaa aayojan achche se ho jaye
 'kalmadi said,' The Prime Minister has given us a lot of support
 isliye chintaa kii koi baat nahin he
 Is our focus
 agle ek maheene main puraa ekagra rahoonga or koi meraa dhyaan nahin bhatka sakegaa
 'asked that after winning the bid in 2003, not much was left for the last time
 kalmadi ne kaha, ‘shuruuaat main sweekruti lene kaa mudda tha
 a certificate was required to start the work
 aapako emsidi, endiemasi or kai anya agenciyon ke paas janaa tha
 Apart from this there were environmental issues and after this some people went to court

 Kalamadi refused to take responsibility for corruption and said that her job is to organize successful sports
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen khelon kaa safal aayojan karnaa he or main yahi kar rahaa hum
 This is my most important responsibility
 iske baad jaanch hogi or phir dekhte hai kisne kya kiya he
 "all the allegations were exaggerated," he said
 jaise ki tailet paper ke liye 4000 rupee, kya yah sambhav he
 These are all false accusations
 ’olympic or asian khelon jaisi pratishthit pratiyogitaaon ke liye bhavishya main bharat kii daavedaari prabhavit hone ke sawaal par kalmadi ne kaha, ‘sabhi khelon ke liye kuch aarope laganaa saamaanya baat he

 The MCD says that Kejriwal is not paying, so no one has the answer to the question of why the Delhi government has stopped the pension

 If the pension belongs to the MCD, it is said that it is closed because the Delhi government has stopped giving money to the corporations
 If Kejriwal would have known that these people had a huge support even with a pension of just 1000 rupees a month
 The salaries of its mlas do not make two and a half lakh that the house of mlas does not run in 88 thousand

 Watch the video here: lakhanu kaa har chauraahaa 12 janvari ko akhilesh yadav or mayawati kii tasveeron vaale hordingon se pata tha
 On this day, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) announced to come together before the Lok Sabha elections
 press vaarta main mayawati ne kaha ki unki party ne ''rashtriya hit main sapa ke saath haath milaane kaa faisla liya he
 Both parties decided to field candidates for 38-38 Lok Sabha seats in the state, while leaving two seats for Congress and two for other allies
 sapa-basapa isse pehle 1993 main saath ai thim, par vah gathbandhan do saal main basapa ke samarthan waapas lete hi tut gaya tha
 At that time, the bitterness had increased so much that SP workers attacked Mayawati, who was lodged in a VIP guest house in Lucknow in 1995
 is ghatana ne donon dalon ko ek duusare kaa kattar dushman bana diya tha
 In a press conference on 12 January, Mayawati twice referred to the 'guest house incident' and said that this alliance is in the interest of the nation
 basapa ke ek netaa ne khulaasa kiya ki 4 janvari ko akhilesh or mayawati kii baithak main siton ke bantwaare ko aakhri shakl di gai or donon ne tay kiya ki ve 'barabari kii partiyon' ke naate baraabar siton par ummidavaar utaarengi
 The BSP leader said, "they felt that if one party gets more seats then it will affect the morale of the voters of the other party
" ''is gathbandhan kii buniyaad march 2018 main rakhi gai thi, jab gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa siton ke upachunaav main sapa ke ummidavaaron ko samarthan dene ke liye mayawati raji ho gayi
 The results of the by-elections in these two seats occupied by the BJP proved that the SP-BSP can together defeat the BJP
 ek saath aakar in donon dalon ko rajya ke 22 fisadi dalit, 45 fisadi anya pichde varg or 19 fisadi musalmaan votaron kaa samarthan paane kii ummid he

 BSP 19 there
 77 fisadi vot paane ke baavjood ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki thi or 35 siton par vah duusare number par thi
 If you merge the SP-BSP, then they 42
 12 fisadi vot mili the or 41 siton par unhen mili sammilit vot bhaajapa ke voton se zyada the
 Ajit Kumar, a professor of political science at Banaras Hindu University, says, "the success of this alliance depends on the synergy of the workers of both parties
" '' 2007 se 2012 ke dauraan basapa ke shashan ke dauraan mayawati ne sapa ke yadav vot bank par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 State Scheduled Caste Commission Chairman Brijlal says, "during the BSP regime, Yadavs had to suffer a lot from the misuse of SC / ST law
 aise kai maamle ab bhi adaalat main hai
 When the SP formed the government in 2012, it canceled the promotions of more than 10,000 Dalit officers
 is tarah sapa-basapa ke buniyadi vot bank ek duusare ke kattar virdohi hai or dalit tathaa yadav vot bank main talmail ke liye donon dalon ko kadi mashkkat kerani hogi
 "both parties have lost their strength after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections," says Manish Hindavi, associate professor at Lucknow University
 baagi netaa shivpal singh yadav kii pragatisheel samaajawaadee party sapa ke vot bank main, khaskar yadavon ke prabhaav vaali siton main send laga rahi he
 On the other hand, leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya, Nasimuddin Siddiqui, Brijesh Pathak were in the BSP in the last Lok Sabha election, who have left the party
 so, pichley chunaav kaa ganit aane vaale sansadeey chunaavon main kaam nahin aayega
 SP, BSP, Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in total 50 during the last Lok Sabha election
 51 fisadi vot mili or 58 siton par unke sammilit vot bhaajapa ke vot se zyada the
 The experience of the SP and BSP has been bad for an alliance with the Congress
 1996 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan congress ke saath apane gathbandhan ko yaad karte hue mayawati ne kaha, ''congress apane vot gathbandhan kii bhagidaar party ko nahin dilava paati, jabaki sahyogi party ke voton ke transfar hone kaa phayda uthaati he
 As a result, the vote percentage of the coalition's partner party decreases
 '' vahiin 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main sapa-congress kaa naakaam gathbandhan karne vaale akhilesh ne kaha, ''congress kaa bhi vahi vot bank he jo bhaajapa kaa he
 If the Congress fights alone, it will damage the bjp's vote bank
 ''chunaav baad gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue congress zyada satark he
 On January 12, Congress President Rahul Gandhi termed the SP-BSP alliance a political decision and also said that he respects Mayawati and Akhilesh
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne daawa kiya, ''congress uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii sabhi 80 siton par ummidavaar utaaregi or bhaajapa ko maat degi
 The Congress is planning to focus on the 23 Lok Sabha seats where it won in 2009
 rajya congress ke ek sachiv ne kaha ki party chote dalon se gathbandhan karegi
 Congress's decision to contest elections alone can be helpful for BJP
 elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main professor mohan singh kehete hai, ''isse musalmaan pasopesh main rahenge or bhaajapa-virdohi vot bantega
 bjp's state organization secretary Sunil Bansal believes that the SP-BSP will have to face the anger of the workers by getting half the seats as compared to the seats it is contesting
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa muqabla karne ke liye bhaajapa ''meraa parivaar, bhaajapa parivaar' abhiyaan shuru karegi
 Under this, party leaders and workers will go from house to house to garner support for Narendra Modi's second term as Prime Minister

 Also, most farmers are based on diesel pumps for farming, which cost around 500 rupees per day
 jinke paas pump hai usamen dijal dalwaanaa padataa tha or pump kaa haada alag
 But about 7 months ago an international NGO explained to some farmers that they could use solar energy
 kisaanon ne baatcheet kii or kareeb 16 kisaan raji ho gayi is prayog ke liye
 The comments is project kaa kul kharchaa 60 lakh tha jisamen se kisaanon ko sirf 10 pratishat hi dena tha

 However, former Communications Minister Raja's former aide and witness Aservartham Achari and CBI both denied the allegations
 raja ke vakil susheel kumaar ne kaha ki vah (aachaari) aapke (sarkari vakil) kamare se sikhkar aate hai
 If you want, i can also give you pictures of it

 kumaar ne aachaari se jirah karte hue kaha ki aap sibiai ke is dabaav main uske gavaah ban gayi ki aapako bhi maamle main aaropee banaaya jayega

 It is wrong to say that i was under pressure from CBI for disproportionate assets
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah kahana galat he ki main e
 Was unhappy with Raja because he did not promote me in politics
 yah kahana galat he ki maine in vajahon se abhiyojan (sibiai) ke liye unke khilaaf jhootha gavaah bananaa pasand kiya

 court ne iske liye jaipur nagar nigam samet rajya ke sabhi nagar nigam, nagarpalika or panchayat janm-pramaan patr ke aise form rakhane ke liye kaha jisamen kisi bachche kaa pita nahin ho to sirf maa kaa naam likhane kaa kollam ho
 Even if the mother is divorced, the father's name is not necessary
 
 or usee pramaan patr ko aadhaar banaakar aage kisi bhi sarkari yaa gaiyrsarkari kaamon main form main keval maa kaa naam likhane kii chhot sarkaar sunishchat kare
 The Supreme Court had given an important decision, Justice Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia has written the decision, declaring it as a Reportable Judgment
 darasal 2015 main hi supreme court ne maa ke naam kaa certificate jari karne kaa faisla diya tha
 But due to the confusion in the government about the case before the verdict in Rajasthan and the reissue of the certificate, it was pending until now
 dobaaraa jari ho saktaa he certificatcourt ne puraane maamle or certificate ke riishu par bhi ise lagu karne ke aadesh die hai
 Also after marriage, if the parents are separated and the child remains with the mother, the father's name should be removed from the old certificate and the new certificate should be issued only in the name of the mother

 The High Court has given these orders while passing judgment on the petition of Mamta Swamy

 There was an uproar in RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's rally in Mahua, Bihar
 lalu ne mahua vidhansabha kshetra se apane bete tej pratap ke chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya, jiske baad kuch log hangaamaa karne lage
 Lalu got angry on this
 unhone logon se kaha ki yadi ve chahenge tabhi tej pratap yahaan se chunaav ladenge
 Both his sons and daughter Misa Bharti have different opinions about Lalu's political successor
 lalu jahaan tejasvi ko apana uttaradhikari bananaa chaahate hai, vahiin rabari kii pasand tej pratap hai
 One of the party wants to bring forward Dhalalalu's daughter Misa
 april main argedy kii kaaryakarini baithak main lalu ne saaf kar diya tha, 'jab uttaradhikari kii baat aati he, to wo betaa hi hota he
 'he had told the younger son, he was announcing during the 2010 Bihar assembly elections that the younger son Tejashwi would be his successor
 us dauraan tejasvi ne party ke liye dhuandhar prachaar kiya tha
 Appeared on stage with father
 us samay tejasvi kii chunaav ladane kii umr nahin thi

 ) When Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2 October 2014 with great fanfare, he too could not have imagined that so much debate would be spread on it
 saaf-safai aisa masalaa he jisase bharat main kai anya varjanaayen or rudh saamaajik manyataayen judi hui hai—masalan, shauchalayon ke istemaal main stri-purush asantulan, hindu dharm main shuddhta or pradooshan kii avadharana jiskaa jati se kareebi rishta he or mailaa nistaaran kii amanviya pratha
 More than 53 percent of people in India do not have toilets
 gaanvon ke maamle main yah sankhya 60 fisadi par pahunch jaati he
 Modi has set a target of constructing 12 crore toilets across the country and 1 for this
 96 lakh karod ru
 Will cost
 bharat main is lakshya ko hasil karne kii jaddojahad chal rahi he, lekin duusari hakeekat yah bhi he ki mahaj shauchalay banavaa dene bhar se yah tay nahin ho jaataa ki uskaa istemaal bhi kiya jayega
 The stated goal of the Swachh Bharat Mission is to free India from open defecation by 2019, for which every Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti and Zilla Parishad will be added to this work
 saath hi gramin aabaadi ke ek bahut bade tabake, schuli shikshakon or chaatro ko bhi is abhiyaan kaa hissaa banaaya jayega
 But after entering the second year of this mission, some studies have started to realize that much needs to be corrected in this campaign and its framework needs to be rethought
 research institute for compashnet iconomics ke uttari bharat ke 3,000 gramin gharon main kiye gaye ek surveykshan ke mutabik 40 fisadi se zyada ghar aise hai jahaan shauchalay hone ke baavjood log khule main shouch karte hai
 The toilets that the government has built here are so small in size that the chances of using them are extremely low
 yah spasht he ki svachh bharat mishan ko logon kaa najariya badalane kii bhi pahal kerani padegi, lekin pataa chalata he ki is mishan ke liye isse pehle upie sarkaar ke aise hi mishan nirmal bharat abhiyaan ke mukaable isamen soochna, shikshan or sanchaar ke liye saat fisadi kam aavanton kiya gaya he
 Garbage disposal is another major challenge
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board ke mutabik, shahari bharat main har saal 4
 70 million tonnes of waste is generated while more than 75% of the sewage waste water is not treated here
 shahari bharat main maamla shauchalayon se kahin aage kaa he
 Shubhagato Dasgupta, senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research, says that unless local bodies are empowered enough to meet the demand for community sanitation so that they can collect and dispose of waste in a scientific manner, then clean The case of India Mission cannot proceed
 svachh bharat mishan kii ruparekha main amulchul badlaav kii jarurat he, taaki logon ko shauchalayon ke istemaal ke liye prerit kiya ja sake or kachra nistaaran ke liye mashiinon kaa istemaal kiya ja sake
 There is no other option
 aisa karnaa hi hoga
 Lack of cleanliness or dirt and dirty water is the root cause of 80 per cent of diseases in rural India and according to UNICEF, cholera is the leading cause of death of children below five years
 modi kii preranadayak pahal se shauchalay kii baat rashtriya vimarsh ke centre main aa gai he, jaisaa ki mahatma gandhi ne 1925 main apane gujarati saptahik main likhaa tha ki ''shauchalay utana hi saaf hona chahie, jitna aapkaa baithkkhaana
 "gandhi himself used to be active in this direction
 ve na sirf apana shauchalay khud saaf karte balki apane aasapaas ke har shaks ko iske liye prerit karte the
 Modi's entire India team and governments will have to come together to clean up what Gandhi described as "our dirty way"
 svachh bharat abhiyaan kii safalataa modi ke kai duusare priy abhiyaanon kii bhi kasuti he
 For example, cooperative federalism, in which the NITI Aayog will establish dialogue between the Center and the states; The synergy between the government, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has to do with many ministries and departments of urban development, drinking water and sanitation, health, water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, rural development and environment, forests and climate change, etc
 iske alaava in abhiyaanon main logon kii bhagidaari bhi bahut jaruri he

 The Janata Dal United chief Nitish Kumar has a government in Bihar and the 'government' notes are currently being seen by change
 nitish kumaar ke ye badale andaaj alag-alag maukon par saamne aa rahe hai
 Recently, he rebuffed the theory of the grand alliance being born ideologically in opposition to the BJP and Modi
 nitish ne saaf kar diya ki wo 2019 main piem pad ke daavedaar nahin hai
 After this statement, Nitish Kumar did not even reach the Congress President Sonia Gandhi for lunch on the presidential candidate
 jabaki agle hi din morishas ke piem se mulaakaat ke bahaane dilli main piem modi se unki mulaakaat hui
 After which many questions began to be raised in political camps
 sawaal ye ki kya modi ko takkar dene ke liye virdohi dalon kaa ek saath aana mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Has the bjp's stupendous victory in the UP Assembly elections weakened the opposition, after which the statements of strong leaders like Nitish showed moderation and spontaneity

 On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav has become the party's survey after the feud in the socialist party

 In such a situation, their intentions to lead the Grand Alliance were also almost washed away, it can be believed
 vahiin bahujan samaaj kii party lagaataar ho rahi karaari shikast ne mayawati ko bhi muhane par laakar khadaa kar diya he
 In terms of electoral arithmetic in this situation, apart from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, no one is in a strong position among the possible constituents of the grand alliance
 yani ab sur ye bhi uthne lage hai ki tamaam virdohi dalon kaa ek saath aakar bhi 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav bijepi ko maat dena ek badi chunauti hoga
 Perhaps that's why, Nitish Kumar distanced himself from the race for the post of PM

 Giving information about the decision of the cabinet, Tamil Nadu government minister d Jayakumar said that the government has recommended premature end of life imprisonment of all the accused convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case under Article 161 of the Constitution, which the Governor has to approve will be sent

 He said that the central government had already opposed the release of the culprits

 If they are released then the wrong message will go
 bataa de ki purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke sabhi doshi pichley 27 saal se jail main band hai
 In 2014, former Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa decided to release all the culprits

 Significantly, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Governor of Tamil Nadu to consider the mercy plea of AG Perarivalan, convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case

 The protest was made by the central government on August 10, which had told the Supreme Court that it did not agree to the proposal to acquit seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 centre ne kaha tha ki unki sajaa main katautee se khatarnaak nazeer pesh hogi or iskaa antarrashtriya asar hoga
 On the other hand, on 20 August, on behalf of Perarivalan alias Arivu, it was told that no decision has been taken even after more than two years on the mercy petition filed by the Governor of Tamil Nadu
 bataa den ki perarivalan par nau volt kii bydaree kii aapurti kaa aarope tha jiskaa istemaal kathith taur par us belt bam ko banane ke liye kiya gaya tha jisase purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or 14 anya kii hatya hui
