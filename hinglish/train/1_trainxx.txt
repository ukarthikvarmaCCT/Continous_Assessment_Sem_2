 Nine months after the death of Sunanda Pushkar, wife of former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor, it is now known that his life was taken by poison
 ames ke forensik department ke teen doctoron kii team ne visra yani sunanda kii pet kii thili kii jaanch ke baad paaya ki pet main jehar ke kuch ansh the
 But what was this poison, what was it, Sunanda himself ate it or was it fed, the answers to all these questions are missing at the moment
 yani sunanda ko kiske jehar ne maaraa ye sawaal ab bhi sawaal hi bana hua he
 Sunanda Pushkar did not die due to illness, neither had a heart attack nor did Orvadose of medicine kill her
 to kya is nae khulaase se sunanda kii maut kii mistry sulajh gai? bilkul nahin! kyonki doctoron ne bas maut kii vajah bataai he
 It has not been told that the poison which came to know was the poison? That poison was the result of some chemical ghalamal or that the poison was carried to the stomach of Sunanda under a conspiracy
 or sabase bada sawaal ye ki wo jehar khud sunanda ne khudakushi ke iraade se liya yaa phir katl ke iraade se kisi ne unhen wo jehar khilaayaa?isi saal 19 janvari ko sunanda kii postmortem report main ye khulaasa haa tha ki unki maut dawa ke overdoj kii vajah se hui he
 In fact, on January 17, Sunanda's corpse was found in a five-star hotel room where two empty leaves of Alprax tablets were found with the corpse
 donon pattey main kul tees tablet the
 But now after the viscera report came out, it was found that Sunanda did not take a single shot of Alprax before she died
 yani dawa kii overdoj se maut hui hi nahin
 After this, the team of three doctors of AIIMS re-examined the viscera report, it was found that Sunanda had some parts of poison in her stomach and this poison became the cause of death
 ames ke forensik department ke teenon doctoron ne apni jo report di he usamen likhaa he ki sunanda ke visra yani pet kii thili main ethail, alcohol, caffeine acetamenophen, katinin ke ansh mili hai
 But which of these poisons or chemicals killed Sunanda, the modal board is silent about this
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki visra report main bahut sari bandishen hai isliye jehar ke kism ke bare main kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The AIIMS Medical Board prepared the viscera report on 27 September and submitted it to the Delhi Police on 30 September
 haalanki report main jehar ke kism kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya he par chah tarah ke jehar kaa naam lekar report main kaha gaya he ki inaki jaanch forencinc lab main mushkil he
 The viscera report arrived, the reason for the death was also given
 par phir vahi sawaal ki kya isse sunanda kii mistry sulajh jaaegi? medical board ne bhale hi jehar ke kism kaa zikr nahin kiya or naa hi ye pataa laga saki he ki jehar khudakushi ke iraade se khud sunanda ne khaaya yaa use khilaayaa gaya
 But he has definitely asked 13 questions from the Dalli police
 modical board kaa kahana he ki agar in 13 sawaalon ke jawaab mil gaye to use aakhri medical opinian dene main aasaani hogi
 Whose poison killed Sunanda, the doctors of course could not answer this question
 magar unheen doctoron ne is maamle kii jaanch ko lekar dilli police ko katghane main khadaa kar diya he
 Forensic experts say the poisoning caused by the death would also have been known if the Delhi Police had given a full investigation report to the Medical Board
 medical board ne apni jaanch report main police kii kai kotaahiyon kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The Delhi Police Commissioner says that the medical report is still incomplete and no further action is difficult until the police themselves reach a conclusion
 lekin modical board kaa kahana he ki jaanch se judi kai aisi chijen thim jo nau maheene baad bhi dilli police ne maangane ke baavjood medical board ko nahin die
 Now with its report, the Medical Board has once again sought answers from the Delhi Police for 13 questions
 medical board ne dilli police se maange 13 sawaalon ke jawaab1
 Why were the pictures of crime scenes not provided to the board? 2
 logon ke bayaan or paristhitijanya saboot kyon nahin die gaye?3
 Some medicines were found from the room along with the corpse
 ye davaaiyaan kisne likhi thim? kahaan se kharidi gai thim? or ye davaaiyaan kiske liye thim?4
 There was no mention of Alprax in the treatment slip of Sunanda Pushkar
 phir alprex kamare main kaise pai gai?5
 Two empty leaves of Alprax from 15-15 tablets were found in the room, while the Viscera report shows that they did not eat Alprax
 6
 Sunanda wore a purple colored top and a Mark & spencer lower while sleeping at the Relax Rest Sleep Company
 unke top par chah jagah halke safed rang ke daag the jo kii estaminophin, cafine, lidoken or methelparaben ke ho sakate hai
 These are circumstantial evidence that needs to be further investigated
 7
 Does Sunanda have a close Alprax account? 8
 maut se pehle kya sunanda ne hotel main koi medical madad lee thi?9
 Where is the statement of the doctor who first saw Sunanda after death? 10
 unke sharir se halki gandi gas kii badboo aa rahi thi or unki bain aankh main ghaav tha
 It should be ascertained that he was already present when he was last seen alive
 11
 Where is the email sent by Dr
 Rajiv Bhasin on January 26? 12
 sunanda kii maut ke baad 26 janvari ko dubai se bheja gaya doctor anil gupta kaa wo mail jisamen unki beemaari kaa zikr he wo kahaan he
 So that he can find out the cause of his illness and death
 13
 Why the forensic investigation was not conducted on the bed sheet and mattress on which Sunanda's body was found? The medical board has also made a sensational disclosure in its investigation report that Sunanda was healthy before death
 yani wo kisi beemaari kaa shikaar nahin thim

 The motive of their demand is that the BJP has stopped the proceedings of the Parliament while the Parliament should go on and debate

 Asked if he was looking at the possibility of a Third Front after this sit-in demonstration by Mulayam Singh, Jaiswal said, "there have been attempts at least a dozen times in the past

 Congress will start its campaign in Karnataka with Rahulisei to focus on the strength of the organization

 The relationship with the workers will be strengthened, but the Congress leadership of the state will clash with the BJP leadership of the state instead of hitting Modi in the political elections in the state

 Modi vs Rahul will not be a political battle that Rahul party will strengthen their hold in the organization by meeting 80 thousand party workers from Karnataka

 Overall, instead of making the Congress election Rahul vs Modi, the state is ready to lead the BJP leadership vs the state Congress leadership

 ' The hearing in the Supreme Court on the Maharashtra case has been postponed till Monday
 shivasena, ensipi or congress kii ore sanyukt rup se daakhil kii gai yachika par desh kii sabase badi adaalat main sunwaayee ke dauraan shikayatpaksh kii ore se joardaar daleelein di gayi
 Kapil Sibal told the court that the Governor is acting on the direct instructions of the Center
 raashtrapati shashan khatm karne kii sifarish, cabinet meeting or raashtrapati ke dastakhat kab hue isaki time line talab kii jaae
 The court has asked to bring the paper of the entire process related to government formation
 supreme courtmen sunwaayee shuru hote hi shivasena kii ore se pesh hue vakil kapil sibbal ne sabase pehle ravivaar ke din sunwaayee karaane ke liye court se maafee maangi, jis par court ne kaha ki samvidhan kii raksha karnaa hamaari dyati he
 While Kapil Sibal is appearing in the court on behalf of Shiv Sena, Abhishek Manu Singhvi is appearing on behalf of Congress
 kapil sibbal-24 oktober ko chunaav parinaam ghoshit kiya gaya
 a majority in the House requires the support of 145 legislators
 24 oktober se 9 november ke bich kuch nahin hua
 During this time the governor did not call anyone to form the government
 kapil sibbal-phir 9 november ko bijepi ko bulaayaa gaya, lekin usne sarkaar banane se manaa kar diya
 Shiv Sena was called on 10 November but was given only 24 hours
 baad main anya partiyon ko tatolkar 12 november ko dopaher main raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya
 Also read --- ncp's new bet, MLA list submitted to Raj Bhavan, Ajit Pawar's name also included Kapil Sibal - pre-election Alliance (bjp-shiv Sena) was broken and new alliance was formed after elections
 22 november kii shaam 7 baje ek pisi main elaan kiya gaya ki ham shivasena, congress or ensipi milakar sarkaar banane par sahamat ho gaye hai or sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karenge
 But the way the decision was taken is unique and i have not yet seen such a decision
 subah rajyapal kii ore se raashtrapati shashan khatm karne kii sifarish kii gai or raashtrapati shashan khatm kar diya gaya
 But there was no cabinet meeting during this period
 phir subah 8 baje 2 logon ko shapath bhi dilaa diya gaya
 Everything that happened is mysterious
 kab prastaav die gaye or aamantran kis tarah se diya gaya
 Nothing is clear on this
 kapil sibbal-agar unako ye gumaan he ki bahumat unke saath he to jald se jald sadan main bahumat sabit karen
 In the meantime, when the Supreme Court asked for all the documents, it said that nothing is on record, but it is being claimed to be between 7 pm and 7 am
 yah dilachasp he ki shanivaar subah 5:47 baje raashtrapati shashan hataaya gaya
 And within 3 hours of this decision, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn in

 mukul rohtagi- main maamle kaa ek pahalu uthaanaa chahta hum
 Look at the cases
 shivasena, ensipi or congress kii ore se pratinidhi bheja gaya
 Is it true
 yachikakarta ne anuchhed 32 ke tahat supreme court aae hai
 But no political party has any fundamental right
 unhen pehle hoicourt janaa chahie
 The earlier orders were based on a personal petition
 bahumat partiyon kii ore se sabit nahin kiya janaa he
 Justice Khanna - These technical objections can be changed
 ve maukhik ullekh karke partiyon ko jod sakate hai
 Ironically, the issue was raised by Kapil Sibal in Karnataka
 ab vah duusari paksh kii ore hai
 Mukul Rohatgi - i am appearing in court on behalf of one and some independent candidates of BJP
 ravivaar ko sunwaayee kii jarurat hi nahin thi
 If a party does not know some facts, what was the need of hearing today
 justise ramanna or justise khanna-ab to bench ban gai or hamane sunwaayee shuru kar di he to is sawaal kaa koi matlab nahin
 Court asked Kapil Sibal any other argument? So he took the example of Karnataka case
 kapil sibbal-ye sabhi aadesh susangat hai ki floor test hona chahie
 The people of Maharashtra need a government
 ve floor test nahin kara rahe kyonki ve is bich kuch alag karnaa chaahate hai
 At 7 pm, we claimed that we will form the government
 rajya main paristhitiyaan unke letters of saport ke thik ulat hai
 We can still prove a majority
 abhishek manu singhvi-sarkaar ke gathan ke liye ek nirdhaarit prakriya hoti he
 The Governor's role is to first satisfy himself through signature and physical documents
 vidhayakon kaa bhautik satyaapan kiya janaa chahie
 - When we announced at 7 pm that we were going to form the government, how did the Governor take such a decision at midnight
 kya unhone faisle se pehle kisi tarah kaa koi satyaapan karaayaa?- siem or dipti siem ke shapath grahan kaa kya aadhaar he? ajit pavaar ne daawa kiya ki mere vidhayak mere saath aa gaye hai
 - The NCP held a meeting yesterday in which 41 mlas were present
 is baithak main jab 41 vidhayakon ne ajit pavaar ko vidhayak dal ke netaa pad se hataane kaa faisla liya to ve kaise daawa kar rahe hai ki samarthan unke paas he?- rajyapal ne prakriya paalan kii hoti to ye sawaal hi nahin uthte
 There is a difference of opinion between the NCP behind the swearing in of the post of Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister
 justise ramanna- yahaan ham party kaa andruni masalaa sunne ko nahin baithe hai
 We have nothing to do with this
 mukul rohtagi-bijepi ne rajyapal ke saath milakar jo kiya wo loktantr kii hatya thi kyonki wo samarthan patr sirf 43 vidhayakon ke dastakhat vaala tha
 Proving a majority in the House alone is the most appropriate and credible measure
 mukul rohtagi-bommai maamle main die gaye faisle main bhi yah kaha gaya he ki nirnay lene kaa sabase acha tarika floor test he
 Other decisions also give 24 hours
 justise ramanna-yah saaf he
 There is no dispute in the Bommai verdict

 singhvi ne is dauraan court ko kuch suzav die ki is tarah samay prabandhan kiya ja saktaa he
 The senior-most MLA should be elected as the Protem Speaker on Monday morning
 11 baje se shaam 4 baje tak vidhayakon kii shapath puri kara lee jaae
 After this, floor test can be done by calling the session
 singhvi-karnataka maamla saaf kahata he ki matdaan gupt matdaan dwaara nahin hona chahie
 There should be open voting and the entire process should also be live
 goa maamle main bhi isi tarah se floor test karaayaa gaya tha
 i appeared for the Governor in the SG Tushar mehta-karnataka case
 hamane saare paper pesh kiye the
 Abhishek Manusinghavi - In the Uttarakhand case, a vote was taken and it was broadcast live
 SG tushaar mehta-wo governor kii ore se dastavej pesh kar sakate hai
 Singhvi- Supporters and opposing members of the motion can be seated separately on the oath or just after the swearing-in, or voting should be held
 sibbal- rajyapal kii ore se sattarudh party ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye 30 november tak kaa samay diya gaya he, iskaa matlab kuch alag ho rahaa he
 The court can order a floor test today or tomorrow
 inamen se kai aise maamle nahin the, jahaan main vidhayakon ke patron kaa utpaadan kar rahaa hum
 There is a deputy CM here who has no support
 yah loktantr kaa khullamakhulla ulanghan he kyonki loktantr sankhya par chalati he
 The governor should not have invited them
 singhvi-compojit floor test ho jaae
 The support letter is signed by 41 mlas, but Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar continues to claim 51 mlas of the NCP in his support
 court aaj yaa kal yaa phir jab suvidha ho floor test karaane kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 Mukul Rohatgi - Article 360 and 361 of the Constitution mentions the rights of the President and the Governor in detail
 361 ke tahat rajyapal apane adhikaar kshetra ke tahat kiye gaye kaam ke liye kisi bhi court ke saamne javabdeh nahin he
 The Governor has the right to elect whom as the Chief Minister
 justise ramanna- rajyapal is tarah kii niyukti nahin kar sakate hai, lekin is par sawaal nahin uthaaya ja saktaa
 Everything is already set
 faisla floor test se hona chahie
 Justice Ramanna- The law is prescribed for everything
 niyam tay he
 Rohatgi- Now the question is what should the court do and what can it do
 justise bhushan- hamen to ye bhi nahin pataa ki kya or kaise kis prakriya ke tahat yah sab kuch hua?rohtagi- tabhi to ham kah rahe hai ki logon ko itani jaldi machaakar ravivaar ko sabko pareshaan karne kii jarurat kya thi?rohtagi- kal ke liye protem spikar kii shapath, vidhayakon ko shapath or phir rajyapal kaa sankshipt bhaashan or phir test ho jaae
 rohatgi-sadan honors the court and the court honors the House
 yahi satya he
 Otherwise, the House should pass tomorrow so that the Supreme Court will settle all the cases in two years

 The court summoned the Governor's order and letter of support till yesterday morning

 Also, notices have been issued to the Center, Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar
 online shopping ke craij pichley kuch saal se teji se badha he
 You will also do online shopping
 ophers or discounts kii vajah se zyada shopping hoti he
 But what should you use as the mode of payment? Cash on delivery? Or card? If your answer is a debit card, then perhaps you should avoid shopping with a debit card
 internet par debit card ditels dekar koi bhi saamaan khareednaa khatre se khaali nahin he
 Online shopping is safe and it is also safe from offline payment
 online shopping ke liye debit card yuj na karnaa darasal aapke bachaav kaa tarika he
 Can avoid many troubles
 agar kuch galat hua to aap isse batch sakate hai
 There are two reasons for not using a debit card for online payment
 bharat main onlinetranjaction k liecard number ke saath password yaa pin kii jarurat hoti he
 The first reason is shopping with debit and credit cards uses e-transaction, but there is a big difference
 credit card kii limit hoti he jisase zyada aap spend kar hi nahin sakate
 But there is no limit on debit cards
 aapke acount main jitne paise hai utane kii shopping aap kar sakate hai
 In other words, if a debit card is hacked, you can often be a victim of online fraud
 mumkin he aapke saare paise ja sakate hai jitne aapke bank acount main hai
 If the credit card is fraud, the amount of credit limit is the same
 duusari vajahcredit card main di gai limit aapkaa paisa nahin hota he
 If you shop with a credit card, then you are using bank money which then becomes a debt on you, which the bank has to repay later
 bank iske liye interest charge karti he or kuch samay tak ye free hota he
 It also acts as protection from fraud
 agar credit card main kisi ne send bhi lagaaya he to ye jimmedaari bank kii hoti he ki wo use frod se bachaae
 You can extend this to the bank that someone has misused the credit card and you are not responsible for it
 zyaadaatar maamalon main bank tranjaction kii khud jaanch karata he or agar unhen ye samaj aata he ki aap sach bol rahe hai to frod kiye gaye paise aapse nahin maange jate hai jo aapke liye acchhee baat he
 If a debit card fraud occurs with you, then you can tell the bank that your card has been misused, it is also possible that you get that money back as well, but the difference between credit and debit card fraud is that If the debit card is fraudulent, then your money will first go away and then if the bank accepts your claim, then you will get it back
 lekin credit card ke maamle main aapkaa paisa nahin jaataa he, jab tak kii bank aage chal kar ye maanane se inkaar kar de ki aapke saath koi frod hua he
 After this you will be asked to pay the money

 Gurjit often had to go out in connection with business
 isi dauraan pati kii gairmaujuudagi main gurprit kii jindagi main 'wo' aa gaya
 He was his landlord's son Ashish
 vah college main padhane vaala chaatr tha
 Gurpreet and Ashish became extremely close
 lihaaja unke bich sari hadein tut chuki thi
 Both used to go around together
 saath khate the
 Used to watch the film together
 isi tarah se donon ishk ke samandar main gote laga rahe the
 Gurpreet's husband Gurjeet had to go to Chandigarh for some work
 maukey ke phayda uthaakar gurprit or ashish ne milane kaa program banaaya
 The two went for a walk on Scooty
 kuch der baad hi donon tii state ke jangal main sadak kinare khadey hokar baaten kar rahe the
 Just then, an argument started between the two
 or thodi der baad unke bich vivaad itnaa badha ki vahiin sadak par ashish ne gurprit kaa galaa ret diya
 Gurpreet fell down on the side of the road there
 wo khun se puri tarah san chuki thi
 Shortly after hitting his throat, Ashish escaped with scooty by chance
 aas-paas ke log ladki kii cheekh pukaar sunakar uski taraf daude lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Due to excessive bleeding, he died in front of people on the road
 logon ne is baat kii soochna police ko di
 Police reached the spot and took Gurpreet's body
 kai logon ne gurprit ko ashish ke saath skuti se vahaan aate dekha tha
 So the police had understood that the murder was done by the one who took Gurpreet there
 police ko is maamle main ashish kaa haath hone kaa puraa shaq tha
 But it remains to be proved that Ashish has done the blood
 lihaaja police ne jaanch padtaal shuru kii
 a selfie was posted on Ashish's Facebook account with Gurpreet
 jo thik katl se kuch der pehle hi post kii gai thi
 The suspicion of the police had now turned into reality

 For the past several weeks, the process of sealing shops in different markets of Delhi has been going on
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad monitering cameti or emsidi ke adhikari lagaataar karrwai bhi kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has described Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal as a formula that can provide relief to Delhi businessmen from sealing
 aam aadmi party or bijepi ke hangaame se kuch din pehle 25 janvari ko arvind kejariwal ne alji anil baijal ko ek khat likhaa tha
 Kejriwal claims that if these 4 things are implemented by the Governor, then the traders can get relief from sealing
 mukhyamantri kaa daawa he ki yah badlaav karnaa, sirf uparajyapal ke adhikaar kshetra main aata he
 The 4 things he has mentioned are
 
 
 1
 FAR of local shopping center should be increased, it should be increased from 180 to 300
 2
 The conversion charge on notified commercial roads should be reduced drastically
 3
 The FAR and conversion charge of the basement should be notified immediately at par with the upper storey
 4
 Late fees on conversion charges should be waived in full
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kanvarjan charge maaf karne kii vajah bhi bataai he
 Kejriwal says, 'traders have deposited conversion charges to MCD for a long time and MCD collected a conversion charge of Rs 3,000 crore
 ise emsidi ne acount se nikaal kar diawart kar diya or duusare mad main istemaal kar liya
 According to CM Arvind Kejriwal, the market from which the conversion charge was collected was to be spent on the development of the same market, but the MCD did not do so
 isliye ab vyapaariyon kaa sara kanvarjan charge or jurmaana maaf kar dena chahie
 Lashing out at bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for taking Gujarat's development model forward, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday rejected it and said the same formula cannot be implemented simultaneously in all states of the country
 rahul ne tejpur loksabhaa kshetra main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'prayek rajya kaa apana swayan kaa itihaas, gyaan, vichaar evam swayan kaa model hota he
 This formula cannot be implemented in all the states of the country
 ' He said, 'assam needs the Assam model, not the Gujarat model
 pehle se hi iske jariye rajya main vikaas or pragati ho rahi he
 ' congress netaa ne kaha, 'gujarat model kaaphi samay se astitv main tha or isko vahaan kii mahilaon, kisaanon or mazdooron ne swaroop pradaan kiya he
 No one person needs to take credit for this
 ' Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Assam Congress President Bhubaneswar Kalita were present with Rahul in the election meeting
 unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa keval ek vichaar main bharosa karti he jo saare desh main lagu ho sake, lekin yah kisi ek vichaar kaa desh nahin he
 ' rahul ne bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke us daawey ko lekar bhi unhen aade haath liya jiske tahat unhone kaha tha ki gujarat samooche desh ko doodh kii aapurti karata he
 Rahul said that the state has been doing well in the dairy sector since the 1950s and he (modi) is not entitled to take credit for it
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki gujarat model ko samooche desh main doharaaya ja saktaa he lekin aisa nahin ho saktaa
 Different states need their own models according to their needs
 unhone kaha ki assam ko gujarat model kii jarurat nahin he
 It needs the Assam model
 
 
 bhaajapa ko lagata he ki ek vichaardhaara samooche desh ko chalaa sakati he, lekin sachai yah he ki yah desh sirf ek soch yaa vichaardhaara se nahin bana he balki hajaaron-lakhon vichaaron se bana he
 Rahul said that the Congress will focus on the needs of 70 crore Indians, who are currently below the level of the middle class and will work for their development and prosperity

 Welcome to the family # bobbydeol@beingsalmankhan@asli_jacqueline # Race3 # Eid2018 In the midst of claims of Indians depositing billions of rupees of black money in Swiss banks, Swiss banks have said that no such alleged amount or claim about black money has any meaning

 But this touch could not come
 jab anuraag ne is bare main suna to unhone khud dialogs ke liye madad kii peshkash kii
 One reason for this was that he liked the script of the film
 'hansi to fansi' ko dharma productions or phantum films saath milakar bana rahe hai or is film main pehali baar actor siddharth malhotra or abhinetri pariniti chopra saath najar aaenge
 The director of the film says, 'anurag has made a very significant contribution, he has made these dialogues alive by giving a great flavor and witty touch

 jodhpur kii kendriya jail main band rape ke aaropee asaram kii bel par sunwaayee tal gai he
 Now the hearing will be held on 13 January
 asaram ke vakil ram jethmalani ne jamaanat yachika par bahes karaane kii badi koshish kii, lekin court ne ek nahin suni or sunwaayee ko taal diya
 a petition for bail was filed in the Jaipur High Court on behalf of Asaram
 jaipur main court or jodhpur main kendriya jail ke baahar date asaram ke samarthakon main is khabar ke baad niraashaa fail gai
 The court told Jethmalani, "do not be hasty"
 Advocate Ram Jethmalani, who arrived tightly to argue for Asaram's bail in court, wanted the matter to be debated today and Asaram gets a bail
 lekin sarkari vakil ne bahes taalane or duusari taarikh die jane kii baat kahi, jise court ne maan liya
 On Jethmalani's repeated calls, the court said what is the hurry? Just a few days ago, Asaram's bail plea was rejected
 abhi court main or bhi maamalon kii sunwaayee honi he, isliye jaldbaaji na karen
 Asaram may be paralyzed! The debate on the application in the Jodhpur District Sessions Court has been completed
 adaalat ne faisla buudhvaar tak ke liye surakshit rakh liya he
 The application given by Asaram said that he may be paralyzed by cold in the jail and his life should be guarded separately keeping in mind the danger
 'asaram adaalat kaa samay barbaad kar rahaa he'sarkari vakil ne dhara 211 ke tahat ek arji di he
 It says that the court's time is being wasted by Asaram's lawyer
 peedita ke vakil ne kaha he ki is maamle main bahes band karke sidhaa charge suna diya janaa chahie
 The court will hear this on Wednesday
 14 dhaaraon ke lapete main bure fanse asaramyon shoshan ke iljaam main giraftaar asaram ko jodhpur police ne 14 dhaaraon main kuch aisa lapeta he ki ab asaram ke liye khuli hawa main saans lenaa mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 From the rape to child sexual harassment and even the trafficking of child trafficking, the book of accounts of all the crimes of Asaram will be accounted for by this case
 soshal media par asaram ke samarthakon ne lagaaya jorgauratlab he ki jail main band asaram ke samarthak unhen jamaanat dilaane ke liye soshal media main ravivaar se kaaphi sakriy ho gaye the
 The # bailon7thjan and # Bapuji hashtags have been in the top 10 trends on Twitter since Sunday
 darasal, samarthakon kii maang he ki asaram ko nyaay mili or unhen 7 janvari ko jamaanat di jaae
 Apart from this, most of the supporters allege that the media used false allegations to defame Asaram
 yah pehla mauka nahin tha, jab asaram samarthakon ne twitor par is tarah se apni aawaaj uthaai he
 Earlier in the month of December last year also # whysobiased? And through the bapuji hashtag, Asaram's devotees tweeted in support of him

 modi sarkaar ke duusare railmantri suresh prabhu ne apana pehla rail bajet pesh kar diya
 For the first time in history, no new trains were announced
 yatri kiraaya bhi nahin badha he
 The railway minister gave this information in the beginning
 aksar railmantri is ghoshnaa ko aakhir ke liye bachaa kar rakhte the, taaki bajet bhaashan main ruchi bani rahe
 But Prabhu Ji told the story of the entire film first
 kuch filmein aise bhi shuru hoti hai
 God wants to speed up your train
 9 rail karidor main gadiyon kii raftaar badhaai ja rahi he
 In this, the speed of the train will be 160 to 200 kmph instead of 110-130 kmph
 taaki dilli kolkata or dilli mumbai ke bich ek raat main hi yatra puri ho sake
 That is, if the bullet train will come as a sample right now, but you can only dream of reaching Delhi from Patna 13 in 7 hours thinking that the existing trains will start running at a speed of 200 km per hour
 bullate train par khaas jor nahin he
 The short paragraph is dealt with, that is, the Lord has stated his priority
 iske alaava 14 in passenger fare only in June last year
 5 pratishat kii vruddhi ho gai thi
 Even after the price of diesel has come down, the freight of some things has been increased
 jaise uria kaa maal haada 10% badhegaa, cement kaa 6
 3% and a little less than 1% in iron and steel
 urvarak mantri anant kumaar ne kaha he ki uria kaa jo daam badhegaa uske liye ham sabsidi badha denge
 While preparing the railway budget, Suresh Prabhu has broadly set four goals
 in lakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye railway jo tarika apnayega vah ye hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that i am more than happy that for the first time a concrete approach has come out to make the railway technically better and modern
 2015 ke rail bajet se railway main sudhaar kii shuruyaat ho gai
 Till now there was talk on the number of trains and coaches
 railway kaa bajet ab badhkar 1 lakh 11 karod rupee kaa ho gaya he jo 65 hazaar 798 karod rupee tha
 So these are the paths for where the money will come from
 railway ko vidyutikaran ke saath patari ko dabl, tripal karne ke liye 27 guna paisa chahie
 The estimated budget of the Railways for five years has been kept at eight and a half lakh crores
 congress ne kaha he ki sirf mumbai dilli or kolkata kii baat he
 Not the whole country
 nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki pipipi mod ko lekar koi spashtataa nahin he
 a question is being raised about the MP fund
 rail mantri ne kaha he ki saansad apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa railway steshnon ko behatar karne main lagaaein
 An MP gets an amount of five crore every year for local development
 saansad nidhi, korporate soshal risponsibility fund se lekar pension fund or rajyon ke saath bhagidaari yojana banane main or kharche ko baantne main bhi, kya inase prabhu aagle paanch saal ke liye saadhe aath lakh karod rupee juta lenge
 There may be an answer that we will not be able to gather, but if it cannot, then what is the way left which the Lord has not thought about what the critics are telling you
 suresh prabhu ne is par jor diya he ki yah paanch saal kaa road map he
 Investment will come from organizations like the World Bank
 kaise aayega or kin sharton par aayega nahin pataa
 Not that it did not come before
 prabhu kaa daawa he ki agar ham upabhokta sevaaon ko behatar kar den to yatri kaa rail main bharosa badhegaa or vah zyada kiraaya de sakegaa
 Prabhu aims that the railways will have to carry three crore passengers every day instead of two crore passengers
 zaahir he yatriyon kii sankhya ke liye coach badhaane honge
 The number of trains will have to be increased
 to phir gaadi or coach kii baat hogi na
 In this budget, Prabhu has said that he will change the design of the stairs climbing the upper berth
 bistar kii dizine ke liye nift se baat kar rahe hai
 After reading the budget, it seemed that Prabhu has lost sight of the problems, he might not have his way completed but has Prabhu not shown the courage to say that the railway is poor
 use nivesh chahie
 Is any secret door to privatization of railways going to open? Did God say that there is no way except privatization? The Prime Minister had said in Varanasi that he would never privatize

 The Election Commission has called all these allegations baseless and said that wherever there was a problem, all the cases have been resolved
 chunaav ayog ne gajipur main lage aaropon par kaha ki yahaan iviem strong rup par ummidavaaron dwaara nigaraanee rakhane se sambandhit mudda tha, jise chunaav ayog ke nirdeshon ke mutabik sulajhaa liya gaya he

 In view of this, the party's General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has released the audio
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha, 'pyaare kaaryakarta, bahanon or bhaaiyon, afavaahon or eggzet pole se himmat mat haariye

 The countdown to the removal of the controversial article-35a applicable in Jammu and Kashmir has started
 yah jaankaree sheersh sutron ne di
 Sources said that two days after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval returned from a trip to the Valley, the Center has decided to deploy 10,000 additional paramilitary forces personnel in the state
 sutron ke anusaar, dobhaal ne apane teen divasiy daure ke dauraan rajya prashasan, police, ardhsainik balon, sena, rajya or kendriya khufia agenciyon ke varisht adhikariyon ke saath vistrut charchaa kii
 Sources said, "in this big contingency plan, all kinds of small things are being taken care of
 kanoon or vyavastha kii sthiti kaise kaam karegi, khulkar saamne rahane waalon se lekar bhumigat rahane vaale algaavvaadi cader kii pratikriya or mukhyadhara ke raajnneetik netritv kii pratikriya bhi isamen shaamil he
 "told by sources," it is clear that no possibility is being left for the occasion
 aadesh spasht prathit hote hai
 To oppose the abolition of Article 35A, there may be an attempt to disrupt peace by violence and anti-national elements under the guise of a public outrage
 ise niyantrit kiya jayega, taaki aam aadmi ko kam se kam asuvidha ho
 "sources say," the entire operation has also been named to deal with the deteriorating law and order after the abolition of article-35a
 " ghati main pichley teen dinon main kendriya sashastr police balon (siepief) kii atirikt companiyon kaa aana bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Special aircraft carrying CAPF have landed at Srinagar airport during the last three days, while convoys carrying additional companies of these forces are arriving in the valley via the Jammu and Srinagar National Highway
 vartmaan main ghati main chal rahi amarnath yatra evam anya suraksha kaarnon se siepief kii 450 companiyon main shaamil 40 hajaar sainik pehle se hi tainaat hai
 This number does not include the strength of the Counter Insurgency (rebellion) Rashtriya Rifles, which carry out counter-terrorism operations in Hindland and provide assistance to the state police and CAPF in difficult circumstances
 kendriya grih mantralay ne haalanki ek aadesh jari karte hue kaha he ki sena 'counter incerjet grid' ko majboot karne or ghati main kanoon vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye hogi
 At the same time, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said that the troops will be deployed in North Kashmir where the security situation is still a challenge
 jaankaar sutron kaa kahana he ki aise tatv, jo saarvajanik rup se utpaat machaane kii koshish kar sakate hai, unki suchi pehle hi taiyaar kii ja chuki he
 Sources said, "these anti-national and anti-social elements will be taken into restrictive custody to prevent them from committing nuisance
" " dilachasp baat yah he ki rajya or kendriya khufia agenciyon dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye raashtra-virdohi or asaamaajik tatwon kii suchi algaavvaadi caderon tak hi simit nahin he
 Sources said, "some local politicians looking to slip political ground from under their feet are also on the radar, so that they cannot take political advantage from the possible situation
" "srinagar main ek rashtriya sammelan ke dauraan guuruuvaar ko kaaryakartaaon kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue jammu evam kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne centre se sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle kii pratiksha karne ke liye kaha tha
 Where considerable petitions challenging article-35a and Article-370 are pending
 abdulla ne kaha, "aap jaldi kyon kar rahe hai? ham sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle kaa sammaan karenge, jaisaa ki hamane hameshaa kiya he
 "he also asked the government to give its clarity on the rumors that it is being said that after August 15, there will be another long crisis in Kashmir
 abdulla ne kaha ki naukarshah afvaah failaa rahe hai or logon ko rashan, davaaiyaan va vaahanon ke liye eendhan jutaney ko kaha ja rahaa he, kyonki anischitata kaa ek lanbaa daur aane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 The National Conference (NC), People's Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and all regional parties of the state have opposed the tampering of articles-35a and 370
 samvidhan ke in donon anuchhedon main kisi rajya ko vishesh darja dene kaa praavdhaan he
 On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party argues that apart from making this provision a hindrance in the integration of the state, it is also a hindrance in the development of Jammu and Kashmir

 Next on the list are New Zealand bowler Darryl Tuffy, whose 30 runs were scored by Australia's Ricky Ponting in one over
 
 
 varsh 2005 main oakland main khele gaye is match main tuffey ke over kaa saamana karte hue ponting ne pehali gend par chakka jadaa, phir duusari gend par do ran liye, teesri va chauthi gendon par phir chakka jadaa, or paanchavin gend par chaukaa maarane ke baad chhathi gend ko phir hawa main hi simarekha ke paar pahunchaa diya
 
 
 Even after this, T30 international matches have scored 30–30 runs in the same over on two occasions
 
 
 varsh 2014 main pakistan ke khilaaf mirpur main khelte hue australia ke eron finch or glen maxwell ke kries par rahete bilaval bhatti ke ke over main 30 ran bane

 On the occasion of the 137th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of a memorial of 'iron Man' Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Narmada district
 is maukey par laalkrishna adwani bhi maujuud the
 Modi laid the foundation stone of Patel's statue today after a two-day public debate between Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's legacy
 sardaar patel kii yah pratimaa duniya kii sabase oonchi murti hogi or iskaa naam stechu of unity rakhaa gaya he
 The height of this statue will be 182 meters and it will be ready in five years at a cost of about 2500 crore rupees
 vahiin sardaar patel ko lekar narendra modi ke prem se congress asahaj mahasoos kar rahi he or donon partiyon ke bich isko lekar jubaani jang bhi ho rahi he
 Modi wrote on his blog on Wednesday, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary will be even more special, as we are going to lay the foundation stone of the Statue of Unity
 unhone likhaa, 182 meter oonchi 'stechu of unity' duniya kii sabase oonchi pratimaaon main shaamil hogi, jiske madhyam se bharat ke louh purush ko shradhanjali arpit kii jaaegi
 It will be located in Sadhu Bet, which is close to Sardar Sarovar Dam
 modi ne blog main kaha, pratimaa kaa nirmaan aadhunik praudyogiki kaa istemaal karte hue pipipi model se kiya ja rahaa he
 a few months ago i requested my farmer brothers and sisters across India to donate the iron equipment used in their farming to build the statue
 unhone kaha ki sardaar patel na keval louh purush the, balki ek kisaan putr bhi the
 i once again appeal to everyone to cooperate in this endeavor
 mangalvaar ko sardaar patel sangrahalay ke udghaatan ke dauraan ek tarah se pradhanmantri manmohan singh or narendra modi ke bich patel kii viraasat par daawey ko lekar bahes si chhid gai thi
 Narendra Modi had said that if Sardar Patel had been the first Prime Minister of India, the condition and direction of the country would have been different, while Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reminded Patel's secular stance
 modi ne apane blog main likhaa, sardaar patel aadhunik bharat ke rachanaakaar rahe
 He crossed many barriers and united the whole country and today we can celebrate our unity, which is due to the efforts of Sardar Patel
 unhone likhaa, yah bhi utana hi sach he ki hamaare desh main kuch takatein hai, jinhen yah ekta raas nahin aa rahi
 He used guns and bombs to intimidate and mislead people
 ham bhagwaan buddha, mahatma gandhi or sardaar patel ke desh se in tatwon ko yah purajor sandesh bhejein ki unka hinsa kaa rasta kargar nahin hoga
 They should change their path to the mainstream and work for the development of the country, so that the dreams of great leaders like Sardar Patel can be fulfilled
 'stechu of unity' america kii 93 meter oonchi 'stechu of liberty' se kareeb doguni oonchi hogi or rio di generio sthit 'christ da redimer' kii pratimaa se chaar guna oonchi hogi
 The convener of the Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti said, "we have asked around 50,000 members of the community to reach the SCA Stadium tomorrow for the agitation
 ’ hardik ne kaha, ‘match kaa meraa tikat pieees kii rajkot unit ne kharide hai or main kal match main shariq hone ja rahaa hum

 Journalists are known for their credibility, but what if they get credit for stealing expensive cutlery (forks, spoons and knives) in London? Something similar happened with a senior journalist who has gone with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on her Europe tour
 mamata bengal main nivesh jutaney ke liye is samay europe daure par hai
 Mamata Banerjee, known throughout the country by Didi's address, was an invitation to a special dinner in London
 is dinar main hai profile beurocrates, udyogpatiyon ke saath bharat or britain ke jane maane log shaamil the
 Everything was being monitored through high-definition CCTV cameras, as special people were attending the event
 lekin mamata banerjee ke saath gaye bengal ke patrakaron ko isse koi fark nahin padaa
 a variety of items were served at the dinner table, along with silver gleaming cutlery, but some people were mesmerized by forks, spoons and knives instead of food
 dashakon se mamata banerjee ke vishwaasapaatr rahe in logon ke liye sabakuch manmutabik rahaa, isi vajah se chaandi ke chamchamaate katlleri ko uthaane or bag main rakhane main unke haath nahin kaanpe
 Surprised by the development, according to sources, the hotel administration made several announcements about this and said that guests please do not carry any goods with them by mistake
 hotel prashasan ne jaan boojhkar aisa kai baar kiya or sunishchit kiya ki hai profile mehmaan is baat kaa bura nahin maanenge agar unhen check kiya jaataa he or ve kisi bhi prakaar doshi paae jate hai
 The hotel administration had CCTV camera recording and the journalist was easily identified
 ek bhashaayi akhbaar ke varisht patrkaar or senior citigen ko aakhirkaar chammach churaane ke liye 50 dollar kaa jurmaana dena padaa
 After this, the entire media fraternity including the Chief Minister became angry with the actions of senior journalist
 mamata ne patrkaar se duuri bana lee
 Senior journalist who paid the fine have been reporting in Bengal for the last three decades
 media jagat main kai logon kaa maananaa he ki yah ek sabak he ki har cheez par hameshaa haq nahin jataayaa ja saktaa
 Although Mamata Banerjee has always dreamed that Kolkata should be developed like London, but the kind of incident that has unfolded seems like a scary dream
 media main ai khabaron ke mutabik rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke fasebuk pej par ek din main hi takreeban 15 hajaar like ghat gaye
 As of July 10, there were 2,15,753 likes on his Facebook page, but by 3 pm on July 11, the number of likes on his Facebook page had come down to 1,99,270
 isse pehle bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pravaktaa jyoti kiran ne yah daawa kiya tha ki lokapriyata paane ke liye rajasthan ke mukhyamantri fasebuk par 'like' kharid rahe hai
 The BJP spokesperson said that as of 1 June, Ashok Gehlot had 1,60,077 likes on his official Facebook page
 lekin sirf 30 dinon main (30 june tak) yah aankada 2,14,639 tak pahunch gaya
 But the cleverness on the page came out with a feature of the page itself
 'most popular city' feechar ke mutabik, gahalot ke panne par sabase zyada like turki ke istambul se the
 By that time, his page was liked by 63 thousand 440 people from Istanbul
 yah aankada 20 june se 7 july ke bich kaa he
 The special thing is that till May 5, Gehlot was the most popular in Jaipur
 bijepi ne ise soshal media scam bataate hue daawa kiya tha ki pradesh bijepi adhyaksh vasundhara raaje se like ke maamle main pichhadane ke baad gahalot ne yah kadam uthaaya tha
 The BJP spokesperson accused Chief Minister Gehlot of buying likes from an Istanbul IT firm and said that the Congress was also portraying its false image on social media
 bijepi ke is aarope par congress pravaktaa archana sharma ne kaha, 'fasebuk par koi kahin bhi baithkar like kar saktaa he
 What is the point of doubting this? mukhyamantri lokapriy hasti hai
 They do not have to fall to this level to gain popularity
 'congress ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki jaipur main baithkar agar apana lokation istambul daalega to pej istambul hi dikhayega
 In such a situation, it can be part of any conspiracy and BJP can also do this work to discredit it
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha, 'aap jaanate hai ki bijepi ke log sibar world main kitne maahir hai or ye sab karne kii unki aadat rahi he
 'significantly, Rajasthan has elections in December and in such a situation, Gehlot and Vasundhara are going out in public along their journey and their cyber experts are continuing their separate fight in the cyber war room

 In the month of August last year, when that MBBS student stepped foot in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Rishikesh, it felt as if he had slipped from the ground under his feet
 shivalik kii hari-bhari pahadibhan or pashulok bairaj main ganga kaa khubasurat najaara jaise uske saamne tha hi nahin, vah dekh rahaa tha ki jis ames main daakhile ke liye usne jivan ke teen behtareen saal laga die the vahaan na teacher hai, na lab or na hi hospital
 Did he renounce his name after taking admission in Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi, in trust of such brand AIIMS
 uske man main to ames ke rup main aise aspataal kii kalpana thi jisaki opidi main har saal 25 lakh se zyada marij ilaaj karaate hai or jahaan ke 50 se zyada department ke doctor duniya kaa kathin se kathin oparation karne ke liye raat-din ek paanv par khadey rahete hai
 This boy is not alone
 dilli ke ames kii tarah desh main khule sabhi chah ames jodhpur, bhopal, raipur, patna, rishikesh or bhubaneshwar kaa yahi haal he
 In the last education session, a total of 50-50 students were enrolled in every college
 ye saare chaatr desh main medical daakhile kii sabase pratishthit pariksha yani ames, dilli kii pravesh pariksha kii merit ke aadhaar par yahaan aae the
 Of these, more than 90 percent are students who were admitted to some medical college before enrolling in AIIMS
 pichley saal jahaan 300 chaatro ko embibies main daakhila mila vahiin, is saal yah sankhya badhaakar 600 kar di gari he
 Apart from this, 360 nursing students are also ready to enroll in six new AIIMS this time
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki 1 july, 2013 se aspataal chaalu kar die jaaenge
 AIIMS Rishikesh recommendation to close, but the claim opens, Dr
 Rishikesh AIIMS Director Dr
 rajkumaar ke 2 april, 2013 ko swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantralay ke sachiv keshav desiraju ko likhe gopneey patr se
 "I want to tell you that work at AIIMS Residential Complex has come to a complete standstill
 badi vinamrata se aapke sangyaan main laana chahta hum ki lagaataar reminder bhejne, nijee taur par baatcheet karne, cameti kii meetingon main baat uthaane or jaanch karaane ke baavjood adhohastakshrit ke ames rishikesh main aane ke baad se echelel ne site par koi kaam nahin karaayaa he
 "HLL is a short name for the public sector company Hindustan Latex Limited, which is famous for making condoms, but is doing the civil work of AIIMS Residential Complex in Rishikesh
 is company ke gaiyr-jimmedaarana kaam se tang aakar ames prashasan company ke khilaaf exiar bhi darj kara chukaa he
 "in view of all this, it is informed that if similar orgy of HLL Ltd
 continues, then in the coming education session, the new batch of MBBS students, recruitment of teachers, recruitment of nursing staff and students of nursing courses The process should be stopped immediately
 ” duniyabar main sammaan paane ke baad devbhumi main beuroperesi ke haathon post hua neurosrjan yaheen nahin rukaa
 He wrote, "this is my last letter about the work of HLL, because before that, all my writing and reading went to the trash
" ”jab is samvaadadaata ne ames rishikesh kii toh lee to samaj aayaa ki yah khat nahin tha, balki ames rishikesh ke halaat kaa shabdachitr tha
 Although tied to the dignity of the post of Director, Dr
 rajkumaar kaa swar tha, ''main apane vibhageeya patrachaar ke bare main koi baat nahin karuunga
 You can see the situation here yourself
 ” sthiti yah he ki hospital ke pravesh dwaar par keechad padaa he
 All the roads in the Residential Complex are incomplete
 girls or bvoize hostel ke chote-chote hisson ko kisi tarah rahane laayak banaaya gaya he
 It is illegal to get things done, Dr
 Bhopal AIIMS Director Dr
 sandip kumaar ne bhi karaayaa tha
 In fact, Kumar knew that if children were given admission, there would be a minimum arrangement of equipment for experimental studies of the four subjects of the first year, Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry and Community Medicine
 unki chintaa gairavaazib bhi nahin thi
 On July 8, 2009, Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad told the Lok Sabha on the tradition of continuous delay in AIIMS construction, "there has been some delay in the creation of six new AIIMS under the PMSSY scheme
 shuruaati deree single project kansaltent khojane ke liye aamantrit nivida ke naakaam hone se ai
 The entire process started from December 2006 was considered to be over and now a fresh initiative is being taken
 ab ames ke liye residential parisar 2009-10 main taiyaar ho jaaenge
 Hospitals and medical colleges will be ready by 2011
 ” lekin 2 disambar, 2011 ko loksabhaa main aaazaad kaa swar badal gaya, ''sabhi chah ames main academik satr 2012-13 se or aspataal academik satr 2013-14 main shuru ho jaaenge
 "despite these announcements, equipment for First Year students has not been purchased till date
 yahi sab dekhte hue bhopal or patna ames ne kuch jaruri upkaran kharide
 But what was the effect of this, is the result of a letter sent on 21 February 2013 to the Secretary, Health and Family Welfare of AIIMS Director Sandeep Kumar
 ''aap nishchit taur par mere un prayaason kii saraahna karenge jiske tahat maine first year ke chaatro ko upkarnon kii kami mahasoos nahin hone di
 
 
 
 lekin main badi pidaa se kahata hum ki hamane takreeban jo kuch bhi kiya he, use phaltu, astitvaheen, gaiyrkanoonee or anadhikrut ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 Please clarify our scope so that we do not have to be discouraged during review meetings
 ”is khat ke baavat jab dow
 When asked by Kumar, he said, "our work will not become illegal by the saying of one man
 ” bhopal main sarv-suvidhayukta aspataal ke july tak chaalu hone kii ummid nahin dikh rahi he
 Work is scattered here
 agar aspataal nahin hoga to dwitiya varsh ke chaatro ko kis hospital se atech karenge
 The same situation is in Jodhpur, Raipur and Bhubaneswar
 tauba kar sakate hai diggaj doctorane ames ko lekar ab tak thodi-si ummid yahi rahati thi, ki atyaadhunik upkaran or suvidhaayen to vakt ke saath aati rahengi, lekin kam-se-kam badhibia doctoron ko nabj to dikhaa hi lenge

 singh ne sachiv, swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan ko jo patr likhaa usase yah timatimaata diya bhi bujhataa najar aa rahaa he
 Dr
 singh kii vyathaa dekhie, ''faikalti sadasyon kii rihaayash kaa intjaam puri tarah andhakaarmay he
 If AIIMS does not take any step soon then it will be impossible to retain good faculty (renowned doctors) with AIIMS
 ” pehle hi chaar varisht doctor ames kaa diarector banane se manaa kar chuke hai
 Fed up with similar circumstances, in February this year, Dean of AIIMS Bhopal, Dr
 kishor choudhary ne apane pad se istipha de diya
 Did Azad lie in Parliament, Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said in the Rajya Sabha on 5 March 2013, "all new AIIMS have appointed officers like Director, Deputy Director, Financial Advisor, Superintendent Engineer and Administrative Officer
 is
 in adhikariyon ko diarector kii ore se prashasnic or vittiya adhikaar die gaye hai
 These powers include purchasing equipment for the institute, maintaining the building and other minor tasks

 Singh Health Secretary Keshav N
 desiraju ko likhe khat main kehete hai, ''mantralay ne kaha he ki upkarnon kii kharid ke bare main diarector koi bhi faisla nahin kar sakate kyonki sabhi chah ames ke liye mantralay yah kaam kar rahaa he

 sabhi chah ames ke nideshkon kii ore se uthaae jane vaale kisi bhi kadam par mantralay sawaal khadaa kar detaa he
 On the right of directors to buy goods, Health Secretary Desiraju said, "under the August 2012 notification, the directors were paid Rs one crore
 tak kaa saamaan kharidne kii chhot he
 It is wrong to make such an allegation
 ” bina hospital ke pehle batch ko bhartee karne ke sawaal par desiraju ne kaha, ''yah sawaal swasthya mantri ne bhi uthaaya tha lekin bihar, odisha or uttarakhand ke swasthya mantriyon ne ames ko rajya aspataalon se atech karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 Apart from this, hospitals will be started as soon as possible this year
 ”lekin jamini halaat in mahatvakankshi daavon ke saath nahin he
 State hospitals have also not received help until the first session ends
