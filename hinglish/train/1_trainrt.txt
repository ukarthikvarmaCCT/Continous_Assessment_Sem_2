 Selfie is not an interview with self
 yah swa yani aatm kaa upbhog he
 Consumption is both
 ham jiskaa upbhog karte hai, vahi hamaara bhi karata he
 We spread garbage in the outer world after consumption and consumption accumulates fat and other diseases in our internal body
 selfi hamaare loukik jivan kaa nayaa rup he jiske upbhog se sakal gharelu utpaada kii dar badhati he yaa sakal gharelu utpaada ke badhane se selfi kii khapat badhati he
 Dialogue is also consumption
 samvaad ke upbhog se kachra paidaa ho rahaa he
 We are spreading waste through dialogue
 kuch bhi likh rahe hai or kuch bhi pard rahe hai
 When nothing happens to these two, they start to see and show themselves
 selfi ek kism kaa photo kachra he
 Earlier there used to be one in selfie, now many have started
 ek frem main kai chehre thuns diye gaye hai
 Face to face has become meaningless

 Everyone sees themselves for once and gets clicked
 safalataa kaa bhi tay frem hota he to selfi kaa bhi he
 There is a crowd around the selfie self that makes us feel successful
 ham akele nahin ji sakate or jab koi saath na ho to selfi ko saath bula lete hai
 The selfie is a byproduct of the desire to be surrounded by a crowd
 jaise hi fesabook par post hota he sabakuch like kii prapti main badal jaataa he Like is a pathetic form of our ambition
 selfi is dayaniyata kaa aavaran he

 Since when has the replica of historic buildings been sold? laazmi tha ki ham duniya chhod khud ko dekhne lage
 People are seeing themselves even after reaching London
 selfi khinch rahe hai
 Like shops and cities, we have all become the same from dress to habits
 frem main ek ho yaa anek sab ek hi hai
 Selfie symbolizes the elimination of diversity of our self
 ham sab selfi hai
 We are collecting every moment of ourselves, but in reality we have to consume it
 dukaan jitani choti hoti he, utpaada ke aakaar bhi ghat jate hai
 In the odd odd corners of the metropolis, there are miniature selfies of shampoo, oil, soap, incense sticks, biscuits, and chocolates, kept in giddy shops
 selfi ham sabakaa chota hona he

 jaldi hi ham is upbhog se ub jaaenge
 We cannot have peace without consumption
 upbhog hi aadhyatm he
 Consume
 upbhog se raashtra tarakkee karata he or naagarik tripti paata he
 The year that has passed, it is telling that we will consume the grains now
 selfi hamaare viraat swa kaa anukan he
 You must be feeling dizzy after reading this article

 But haven't we had our selfies? Those who survive from it are very poor

 a public interest litigation has been filed in the Delhi High Court regarding the contradiction in the RTE (right to Education) Act and its implementation
 sunwaayee ke dauraan hai court ne dilli sarkaar or maanav sansaadhan vikaas (echaradi) mantralay ko notice jari kiya he

 Governments will have to ensure that such a situation does not affect the children's education and at the same time the poor parents are not forced to give up their children's studies

 The petition said that nowhere in the RTE rule is there any mention of the rest of the education expenses like transportation, school project related expenses, essential items for the differently-abled children to go to school and the needs of the differently-abled children, due to which Poor people have to bear many expenses to teach their children, whereas under the RTE Act, parents only need to send children to school
 No responsibility, costs
 31 agast ko hogi agali sunwyeephilhal is maamle main agali sunwaayee 31 agast ko hogi
 The petitioner says that the government and schools are not able to provide the facilities given in the RTE rule
 aise main artii kaa phayda us varg ke bacchon ko mil hi nahin paa rahaa he, jo iske hakdaar hai
 Therefore, to implement RTE properly, there is a need to stop the tension between the government and the schools
 hai court philhal dilli sarkaar ke jawaab kaa intjaar kar rahaa he kyonki uske baad hi court echaradi ministry or centre sarkaar kaa rukh dekhegaa

 sapana ne kaha ki singer naachna jaanate hai, lekin swaarthee nahin hote
 Kejriwal is selfish
 unhone dilli vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bhartiya janata party ke liye prachaar karne baat kahi he
 Why Sapna Chaudhary was angry with Kejriwal? Sapna avoided the question of presenting bjp's CM Manoj Tiwari as Delhi CM
 unhone kaha ki ham kalakaar hai
 Let us be down
 sapana se jab poocha gaya ki vah bijepi se chunaav ladanaa chaahati hai to unhone kaha ki main swaarthee nahin hum
 Let me tell you that there was news of Sapna Chaudhary going to Congress during the Lok Sabha elections, but Sapna denied it the very next day

 This election will be fought between the people of Delhi and Kejriwal
 tiwari ne kaha ki dilli kii janata kah rahi he ki kuch bhi ho jaae 'kejariwal aap ko janaa he
 In view of the preparations for the assembly elections, Tiwari said that the digital chariot will go to the 70 legislative assemblies of Delhi and expose Kejriwal's hollow promises

 However, the police officer did not say how many policemen have been deployed under his protection

 He said that when someone says 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' it is not just about a goddess in a picture

 He said that Hindutva is the culture and tradition of India which has passed through different generations
 upasna ke alag-alag tareeke ho sakate hai lekin jivan jeene kaa ek hi tarika he or vah he hindutv
 Naidu said that our culture teaches 'vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' which means the world is one family

 Pakistani courts have paved the way for the Mumbai 26 / 11 attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed to roam free
 uski pakistan main najarbandi se rihaai ab kisi bhi vakt ho sakati he
 The US has also taken this development seriously with India
 america videsh vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne buudhvaar ko kaha, ‘prashasan un media reports se avgat he jinamenlashkar-e-taiyaba netaa hafiz saidki ghar main najarbandi se rihaai kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 The US maintains its belief that Hafiz Saeed is a global terrorist and that the US sanctions against his organization lashkar-e-taiba will continue
 26 / 11 hamale ko nau saal puure hone se kuch hi din pehle pakistan kii ek adaalat ne hafiz kii rihaai kaa aadesh diya
 The court also did not consider the appeal of the provincial government of Pakistan seeking extension of Hafiz's detention by three months under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO)
 pakistan sarkaar ne ashanka jataai thi ki hafiz kii rihaai se antarrashtriya samudaay ko pratibandh lagane kaa mauka milegaa
 However, the double face of the Government of Pakistan itself was exposed because it did not present any such evidence itself to prove why it is necessary to keep Hafiz under house arrest
 yahi court ke liye hafiz kii rihaai kaa aadesh dene kaa aadhaar ban gaya
 As far as the United States is concerned, the recent Congress decision was severely criticized, in which Pakistan's financial support from the US was set aside from what action Pakistan takes against lashkar-e-taiba
 haalanki america prashasan kii ore se ye saaf kiya gaya ki wo apane is mat par kaayam he ki hafiz said global terrarist he
 In May 2008, the US administration declared Hafiz a 'specially designated global terrorist' under Executive Order 13324
 26 / 11 hamale ke baad disambar 2008 main sanyukt raashtra ne bhi yuanessiaar 1267 ke tahat hafiz ko vayktigat taur par ingit kiya tha
 India and the United States have been working together to bring the culprits of the 26 / 11 attacks to legal consequences
 iske liye intelegence inputs or sabooton ko bhi aapas main saajha kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Let us tell you that some American citizens were also among those killed in the 26 / 11 attack
 america ke videsh vibhaag ke adhikari ne kaha, ‘america apane is mat ko doharaata he ki lashkar-e-taiyaba soochibaddh videshi aatankwaadi sanghathan he jo ki aatanki hamalon main saikadon nirdosh logon kii hatya ke liye jimmedaar he, jisamen kai america naagarik bhi shaamil hai
 "the official further said," lashkar-e-taiba and many of its frontal organizations, leaders and members remain subject to sanctions from both the State Department and the Treasury Department
 ’hafiz saidais saal 31 janvari se pakistan main ghar main najarband he
 But now he can be released at any time after the court order

 It was getting very late in the night, as the priest was late in arriving, Anjali decided to set up the urn on her own
 anjali ne kaha ki wo brahman samaaj se hai or khud unhen vidhi vidhaan se puja paath aata he
 Anjali's initiative brought joy to everyone's faces
 mahila thanedaar ko puja karte dekh ek pandit aage aae
 But by then Anjali had sat for the puja
 anjali ke mutabik unhone bich main puja chhodana sahi nahin samajha or pandit ke nirdeshaanusaar pratimaa kii sthapana kii
 When the news of this incident spread, the worshipers who offered prayers in the area started to clarify that they could not reach here due to being busy in worship at other places
 saath hi unhone chhooaachhut jaisi kisi baat se bhi inkaar kiya
 Kripal, who hails from the village, said that he had gone to call the priest to install the idol of the goddess, but he clearly said that we will not do the installation
 mahila thanedaar main saamaajik samarasata kaa anoothaa udhaaharan pesh kiya

 Ayushman Bharat Yojana or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, commonly called 'modi Care', has been implemented from April 1, 2018
 kendriya vittamantri arun jetali dwaara vittvarsh2018-19ke aam bajet main prastaavit kii gai narendra modi sarkaar kii is mahatvakankshi yojana ke tahat garibi rekha se neeche (bpl)aane vaale pariwaron ko paanch lakh rupee tak kaa nakdirahit swasthya beemaa uplabdh karaayaa janaa he
 It has been said that after giving the benefit of this scheme to 50 crore members of 10 crore BPL families, the remaining Indians will also be included in it
 ujjwala yojana mul rup se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dimag kii upaj bataai jaati he,jinhone karodon sampann bharatiyon se rasoi gas silendaron par milane vaali sabsidi ko swechha se chhod dene kii apil kii,or centre sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is apil ke parinamswaroop karodon logon ne sabsidi kaa tyaag kar diya,or uski badaulat paanch karod garib mahilaon ke rasoigharon main rasoi gas pahunchi,yaa unke pariwaron ko sidhaa laabh mila
 In fact, during the tenure of the previous UPA government the subsidy on LPG was limited, and non-bpl families would get subsidy on only nine LPG cylinders a year, but thereafter any subsidy on the cylinders used Was not given
 narendra modi sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki azaadi ke baad lagbhag70saal biit jane par bhi desh kii karodon kii aabaadi banking vyavastha se achhuti rahi,or adhikansh janata ke paas ek bank bachat khaataa tak nahin tha,so,ve yah yojana lekar aae,jiske tahat zero-balance bank bachat khate khulwaaye gaye
 The most successful schemes of the Central Government mention the Jan Dhan Bank Account Scheme, which not only gave crores of Indians a chance to connect directly with the banking system, but the poor countrymen who benefited from the scheme despite having zero-balance accounts 81,203 crores deposited in banks
 bharat main jivan beemaa karne ke liye aaj life insurance of india (lic)samet kai companiyaan maujuud hai,jinke paas karodon graahak bhi hai,lekin sarkaar kii taraf se kabhi koi beemaa policy jari nahin kii gai thi
 On 9 May 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced three schemes under the Jan Suraksha Yojana, including the Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY)
 pmjjbyxo lakh rupee tak kaa jivan beemaa pradaan karti he,yani bimit vyakti kii mrityu ho jane kii sthiti main uske parivaar ko do lakh rupee kii raashi di jaati he
 The policy available under PMJJBY has to be renewed every year, and a premium amount of Rs 330 has to be paid for it
 is raashi ke atirikt bimit vyakti ko maujuuda varsh main lagu sarvice tex tathaa bainkon kii administrative fees ke taur par41rupee chukaane hote hai
 The central government claims that as of May 2018, about 19 crore Indians have joined the scheme
 9may, 2015ko pradhanmantri ne jin do anya yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kii thi,ve pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana or atal pension yojana hai
 Unemployment has been a problem among the country's growing population, which has upset most Indians
 isi samasya se nipatane ke uddeshy se narendra modi sarkaar ne logon ko swarojgaar kii ore modane kaa prayaas kiya,tathaa yuvaaon se apana-apana kaarobaar sthapit karne kaa aagrah karte hue mudra yojana shuru kii,jiske tahat sarkaar kii ore se rin uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he,taaki log apana vyapaar shuru kar saken yaa pehle se sthapit vyapaar kaa vistaar kar saken
 The government also describes this scheme as very successful, and claims that till May, 2018, 12,78,08,684 loans have been disbursed under the Mudra scheme
 desh main kisaanon kii samasyaayein lagaataar badhati nazar aa rahi thim,or aedin kisaanon dwaara khudakushi karne kii khabaren bilkul aam ho chuki thim,jo ab tak thami nahin hai
 The Narendra Modi government announced to make Soil Health Card with an aim to solve their problems, under which 13,33,13,396 Soil Health Cards were made till May, 2018
 centre sarkaar kaa daawa he ki soyal health card se kisaanon ko sidhaa laabh pahonchega or vah is card kii madad se na sirf zamin kii upjau shakti ko samaj paaenge,balki yah bhi jaan paaenge ki unhen kis fasal ke liye kitna uria or khaad kharch karnaa padegaa
 The government claims that with the help of this soil health card, farmers will be helped to increase their income
 desh main lagaataar badhati aabaadi ke saath-saath bijli kii maang bhi lagaataar bad hi rahi he,jisase nipatane ke liye centre sarkaar ne janata se aagrah kiya ki saadhaaran balbon,tubaliton tathaa sieffel (cfl)balbon ke sthaan par elidi (led)balbon kaa istemaal kiya jaae,taaki bijli kii khapat ko kam kiya ja sake
 Not only this, the government also provided LED bulbs at cheaper rates under the UJALA scheme, and the Narendra Modi government claims that 29,96,35,477 LED bulbs have been distributed to the people till May, 2018 under the UJALA scheme
 ab internet se shahari bhartiya hi nahin,bahut-sa gramin hissaa bhi nawakif nahin he,lekin takanic kaa puraa laabh ab tak bhi saare desh main nahin pahunch rahaa tha
 With a view to extend the benefit of technology to all the villages of the country, the Narendra Modi government started work through BBNL to arrange net-connectivity across the country through optical fiber
 sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki gaanvon tak takanic kaa vistaar hone se bhrashtachar par bhi ankush lagaaya ja sakegaa,or sabhi deshavaasiyon tak soochna kaa vistaar bhi saral ho sakegaa
 The central government claims that as of May 2018, 1,15,703 villages in the country have been linked to the scheme
 azaadi ke70saal se bhi zyaada biit chuke the,lekin desh ke kone-kone tak bijli bhi nahin pahunch pai thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government took steps to change the same picture, and now they claim that by May 2018, electricity has been delivered to 18,374 villages in the country where there was no electricity till now
 chhattisgarh main pichley pandrah saalon se satta se dur congress ne bijepi ko gherne ke liye nayaa pintara aajamaaya he
 Congress state president Bhupesh Baghel has alleged that BJP is now resorting to tantra-mantra to come to power for the fourth time
 vahiin bijepi ne ise congress kaa maansik diwaliyapan qaraar diya he
 In fact, one Baba came to the Assembly in Raipur on Wednesday
 ye baba or koi nahin balki chhattisgarh ke hi jaanjgir champa jile ke ek mandir ke pujari hai or bijepi ke sakriy kaaryakrtta bhi hai
 These baba are said to have left for the Amarnath Yatra, and after stopping at Raipur for some time left for their destination
 lekin congress ko andeshaa he ki baba tantra-mantra karke vidhaan sabha se nikle hai
 In the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, the proceedings of the House started on its regular time on the fourth day of the monsoon session
 lekin sadan ke baahar vidhansabha ke galiyare main congressiyon ke bich is baat kii khub charchaa rahi ki bijepi chauthi baar satta main aane ke liye tantra-mantra kaa sahaara le rahi he
 As much as the mouth
 lekin kisi ne bhi tantra-mantra hote nahin dekha
 Let us know that on Wednesday, a Baba Dan had reached the assembly premises in connection with Dakshina
 vidhayakon or mantriyon ke daftaron ke chakkar kaatane ke baad baba waapas laut gaye
 No one is aware of whether or not anyone has donated them
 lekin baba amarnath yatra main jane kii baat kahkar logon se aarthik sahaayta kii maang kar rahe the
 Then they kept searching for leaders and mlas in the campus for about 35-40 minutes
 iske baad wo vidhansabha se waapas chale gaye
 But the Congress fears that this Baba had come to the Assembly not for dan-dakshina but for Tantra-mantra
 taaki chauthi baar bijepi phir satta main kabiz ho jaae
 The Congress alleges that Baba has gone here by performing tantra-mantra
 congress kaa yah bhi aarope he ki chauthi baar satta main aane ke liye bijepi tantric kriyaaon kaa sahaara le rahi he
 At the same time, inside the assembly premises, no one has seen Baba doing tantra-mantra nor recitation
 vidhansabha main vidhayakon , netaaon, afasaron or patrakaron ke alaava aam janata kaa puure samay aana-janaa laga rahata he
 The general public comes here to watch the proceedings of the House
 jabaki police or vidhaan sabha ke suraksha adhikariyon kii bhi choubison ghante vidhaan sabha parisar main tainaati rahati he
 Amidst such a huge gathering, no one saw Baba doing tantra-mantra
 suraksha kii drushti se lage kisi bhi camere main aise koi drishy nahin paae gaye
 No such evidence has been found anywhere outside the assembly premises, which suggests that there has been a tantra-mantra or a puja-text
 congress khud bhi koi aise pramaan nahin de pai he, jisase tantra-mantra kii pushti ho
 Therefore, the BJP has retaliated on the allegations of the Congress
 party kii daleel he ki lagaataar pandrah saalon se satta se baahar rahane ke kaaran congressi naa keval andhvishwasi ho gaye hai balki unki buddhi bhi bhrasht ho gai he
 MLA Raju Kshatriya, while calling the Congressmen's allegations baseless, said that he should give any one proof of tantra-mantra
 unhone kaha ki vidhaan sabha saarvajanik sthal he
 Here the general public often comes to see their leaders and mlas participating in the proceedings of the House
 dheron logon ke bich is tarah ke aarope lagaana congress ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 Who is Baba? The name of this Baba who reached the assembly is Ramlal, who is a resident of Champa Janjgir district of Chhattisgarh
 bataaya jaataa he ki wo bijepi ke sakriy kaaryakarta hai or ek mandir ke pujari bhi
 Ramlal is fond of wearing many garlands around his neck and many rings in all the fingers of his hands
 vah aksar maathe par laal tikaa or bhagava vastra pahante hai
 It is also said that the weight of stones and necklaces around his neck is about 10 kg
 vah jitne samay vidhansabha parisar main rahe logon kii nigahen un par lagi raheen
 With no evidence of tantra-mantra coming out, BJP has taught Congress that elections are won by work and development and not by tantra-mantra
 gauratlab he kichhattisgarhmen vidhansabha kaa yah aakhir satr he
 After this, assembly elections will be held in the state
 aise main lagaataar pandrah saalon se satta paane ke liye congress, apane mukhya virdohi dal kii har ek gatividhiyon par nigaah lagaae baithi he
 Be it political activities or the arrival of leaders and babas

 kendriya mantri gopinath munde mangalvaar subah mumbai ke liye udaan pakadaney ghar se nikle the
 But watch the game of luck, in the evening, he was taken to Mumbai with full state honors by a special aircraft of the Indidan Air Force, because a road accident took his life before Munde could reach Erpopart from his government home in Delhi
 ye sab kuch hua 60 minute main
 The last 60 minutes between life and death
 kendriya mantri banane ke baad gopinath munde pehali baar mumbai ja rahe the
 There he was to attend his own reception
 samaaroh main hissaa lene ke baad unhen raat ko hi waapas dilli pahunchnaa tha, kyonki chaar june se loksabhaa kaa satr shuru ho rahaa he
 Gopinath Munde had left home from his government residence 21 Lodhi State at 6
12 am in a white colored government car SX-4 (DL8CBF 0034) to go to Mumbai
 car driver chalaa rahaa tha
 Munde was seated in the back seat of the car on the left side, while his PA was seated with the driver ahead
 subah 6 bajkar 20 minutesubah-subah kaa vakt tha
 Normally, Gopinath Munde would reach the airport from his home within half an hour
 21 lodhi state ke apane sarkari nivas se nikalne ke kareeb aath minute baad munde kii car prithviraj road-tughlaq road intersection, aurbindo maarg par pahunchati he
 There was not much rush of vehicles at the intersection, but the traffic signal was working
 jaise hi is intersection par munde kii car pahunchati he achaanak bain taraf se ek indica car (DL7CE 5459) aati he or munde kii car se bain taraf se takaraati he
 The tucker is from the same door Munde was sitting on
 us vakt munde car main baithe akhbaar pard rahe the
 As soon as the collision occurs, Munde's hands are released from the newspaper and his face and nose hit the back of the seat next to the driver
 takkar hote hi achaanak munde kii tabiyat bighad jaati he
 They immediately ask for water from the PA
 pani pine ke baad wo bas itnaa hi bolte hai ki mujhe aspataal le chalo
 After this, he faints
 munde kii haalat dekh pie or driver donon ghabara jate hai or car ko safadarajang road kii taraf mode dete hai
 Gopinath Munde arrives at AIIMS Trauma Center within 6:30 AM in the morning
 doctor jab unhen dekhte hai to pataa chalata he ki naa unki saans chal rahi he, naa nabj, naa bladpressure or yahaan tak ki dil bhi nahin dhadak rahaa tha
 The team of doctors then immediately tried to improve his condition through CPR
 seepiaar yani cardio pulmonery resus-saiteshan
 This effort continued for the next 50 minutes
 subah 7 bajkar 20 minatadoctoron kii koshish naakaam rahi
 At 7
20 am, doctors declared Gopinath Munde dead
 doctoron kii maane to munde kii maut aspataal aane se pehle raste main hi ho chuki thi
 How did the accident happen? Whose mistake was it? The Delhi Police says that the fault is from the driver of Indica
 wo tej raftaar se car chalaa rahaa tha
 But according to police sources, the truth that has come out after questioning both the drivers is that the accident occurred due to the fault of the driver of accident Gopinath Munde
 munde ke driver ne red lite jump kiya or isi vajah se ye haadasa hua
 According to police sources, when Union Minister Munde's car reached Prithviraj road-tughlaq Road intersection, the light was red
 yani munde kii car ko vahaan ruknaa tha, lekin munde ke driver ne car rokane kii bajaae aage badha di
 At that time the car was running at a speed of 60 to 70 kilometers per hour
 thik usee vakt safadarajang kii taraf se ek indica car aa rahi thi
 The light was green, so the driver pushed the car forward
 magar cirkil par achaanak indica kii dayee taraf se munde kii car saamne aa gai
 According to police sources, the driver of Indica hit the brakes with full force, but the car crashed and crashed into Munde's car
 takkar hote hi indica ke driver ne gaadi roki or neeche utraa
 Munde's driver also came out
 tab tak indica ke driver ko pataa nahin tha ki car main kendriya mantri baithe the
 But he had guessed with the red light
 indica ke driver ne hi 100 number par police control room ko phone kiya
 Gave information about the accident and told that there was a red light in the car
 police sutron ke mutabik haadase ke baad gopinath munde kii tabiyat bighad rahi thi lihaaja unke kehane par diver unhen fouran ames le gaya, jabaki indica kaa driver maukey par hi khadaa rahaa
 Later, when the police reached the spot, the driver and the car were taken to Tughlaq Road police station
 baad main indica ke driver gurinder ko police ne adaalat main pesh kiya jahaan se use jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 The driver of Indica also said in court that the driver of the red light Munde had jumped
 aakhir kaise hui munde kii maut?ye sawaal isliye kyonki haadase ke baad munde ke jism par chot kaa koi bahari nishaan nahin mila tha
 Initially, it is said that death occurred due to bursting of lever
 phir dil ke daure kii baat kahi gai
 Then in the evening, Union Health Minister Dr
 harshavardhan ne kaha ki haadase main jabardast jhatka lagane kii vajah se munde ke gardan kii haddi tut gai
 Looking at both the cars involved in the accident, it is not known that this will cause serious injury to the people sitting in the car
 vaise bhi gopinath munde ko chhod den to donon main savaar baaki teenon ko chot nahin ai he
 According to AIIMS doctors, at the time when Munde was brought to AIIMS Trauma Center, his breath, heartbeat, pulse were not working at all
 yani is hisaab se munde kii maut haadase ke fouran baad ho gai thi
 Gopinath Munde was a diabetic patient
 doctoron ke mutabik jab car main takkar hui thi tab munde ke sir, chehre or gardan par chot ai thi
 Health Minister Dr
 harshavardhan kaa kahana he ki shuruaati jaanch main aisa lagata he ki jabardast jhatka lagane kii vajah se gardan kii koi haddi tut gai thi
 But the question is, can anyone drink water with a broken neck? Because according to Munde's PA and driver's statement, Munde had drunk water after the accident
 kya haadase kii vajah se munde kii liver ko nuksaan pahunchaa or internal bleeding kii vajah se jaan gai? ames ke doctoron kii maane to ek vajah ye bhi ho sakati he
 Apart from this, doctors are also not denying that the cause of death can also be heart attack
 vaise postmortem report buudhvaar ko aane kii ummid he

 bharat or westeindies ke bich doosraa vanade shuukravaar ko vishakhapattanam ke rajasekhar reddy stadium khelaa jayega
 This is also the lucky ground of Team India, the players of the team who flopped in Cuttack will get new enthusiasm from the happy memories of this ground
 ab ummid yahi he ki is maidan par sahvaag and company jeet kaa chaukaa lagaayenge
 This ground is lucky for Team India
 is maidan par bharat ne rache hai ek se badhkar ek kirtiman or yahaan team india kaa record he sau fisadi
 India has played 3 matches here and has won all
 bharat ne yah jeet kisi aisi waisi team ke khilaaf nahin, balki pakistan, srilanka or australia ke khilaaf darj kii he
 The West Indies are already splashing with defeat
 puri test series, or phir van-de main behad kareeb aakar haar jane kii kasak dabaav main badal chuki he
 India does not have to weaken its hold
 aise main vishakhapattanam se behatar maidan bhala koun sa ho saktaa he
 Then there is the chance to register a big win against the West Indies
 aakhri test or pehle van-de main jo dhilaai barti use peeche chhodane kaa
 On this ground, India had scored the most runs against Pakistan
 356 ranon ke jawaab main paak 298 par post ho gaya tha
 It was here when Australia scored 289 that India won the match by 5 wickets
 isi maidan par duniya ne pehali baar dhoni kii dhooma dekhi thi
 It was here that Dhoni scored his first one-day century with 4 strong sixes and 15 fours
 maujuuda team main is maidan par khilne kaa anubhav sirf chuninda khilaadiyon ko he par sahvaag se lekar raina or viraat tak apni un badi pariyon ko yaad rakhana chahenge jo team ke liye yaadgaar rahi
 There has been a hat-trick of wins on this lucky ground
 ab chauke kii baari he
 The field is lucky but even luck will not work, it is necessary that Indian players learn from past mistakes and show strong game in this match
 maidan bhi lucky he or team india kaa vijayrath bhi teji se daud rahaa he lekin kya sirf takadir se hi team india ko jeet hasil ho jaaegi
 Seeing the preparation of the West Indies, the answer to this question is no
 har kisi ne dekha he ki katak main westeindies kii pes bydaree ne team india ke liye kaise alarm baja diya
 Caribbean bowlers craving for a win in India, if they get a little chance in Visakhapatnam, they can lose the hopes of a clean sweep in the ODI series
 westeindies ke tej gendbaaz kimer roach or andre rasel se nipatane ke liye team india ke ballebaazon ko khaas ranneeti banani hogi
 In Cuttack, both of them shared the top order of Team India
 vishakhapattanam main jeet ke liye jaruri he ki team india ke gendbaaz westeindies ke ballebaazon par shikanja dhilaa naa padane den
 Dwayne Bravo is in superb form in the West Indies team, while there is also Kieron Pollard, whose batting batting can turn the match in one or two overs
 bharat-westeindies ke duusare vanade ke liye batting trek taiyaar kiye gaya he, is maidan par khele gaye maichon main har baar tiimon ne 250 kaa aankada paar kiya he or is baar bhi curator kaa kahana he ki yahaan ranon kii barsaat hogi
 Changes in Team India's playing eleven for Visakhapatnam ODI are not expected, the team management is not in a mood to tamper with the winning combination
 rohit sharma ne katak main kii gai galati ko phir kabhi nahin dohraane kii kasam khai he
 Rohit, who played 72 runs in the first ODI, lost his wicket very close to victory

 It is very difficult to stop Team India's victory in Visakhapatnam after Cuttack

 Sammy said that he does not understand why his team has not achieved a single success so far on this tour despite reaching so close to victory
 vishakhapattanam vanade par barish khalal daal sakati he kyonki agle teen din vahaan boondabandi kaa purvanumaan he
 The stadium is expected to be packed on this occasion
 katak main team india jeet to gai lekin overconfidence ne kai baar daraa bhi diya or tension bhi badha di
 The Transgender Persons (protection of Rights) Bill 2019 was passed in Parliament to protect the rights of transgenders
 to kya adhikaron ke liye lambey samay se lard rahe transgender samudaay ne kya raahat kii saans lee he? kya ab transgender samudaay adhikaar ke saath sammaan janak jivan ji sakenge? transgender samudaay ke hiton ke liye andolan karne vaale 'gres banu' ne vidheyak paas hone ke din ko 'gender justise murder de' qaraar dete hai
 Grace and angrily speak, the bill is about to kill the trans community, it was hoped that the government would make laws and plans for the interest of this community
 lekin trans samudaay ke adhikaron kii raksha ke naam par laayaa gaya yah vidheyak 'bahut bada dhokhaa' he
 According to Sylvia Karpegem, who has worked closely with public health doctors and the transgender community, the bill was passed without much discussion
 ve 4 praavdhaan par to kadha etraj jataati hai
 The second number of this measure reviews 'prohibition against discrimination'
 ''yah praavdhaan kahata he ki shiksha, rojgaar, swasthya sevaaon, saarvajanik sthal par kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav, andolan karne kaa adhikaar, praparty par adhikaar yaa kiraye par rahane kaa haq, matlab yah vidheyak is samudaay ke vyakti ke saath moulik adhikaron main bhedbhaav ke khilaaf nishedh karata he
 But positive affirmation does not appear
 raajnneeti main hissedari kii baat honi chahie thi jo is vidheyak main nahin he
 The third provision is also fraught with difficulties
 "it says that if the family of a trans community is not able to take care of it, then it will be placed in the rehabilitation center
 '' yah praavdhaan trans samudaay kii bhaavana ke bilkul vipareet he
 These people want to live in the midst of their community
 yaa phir kai log auron kii tarah 'swatantra' bhi rahanaa chaahate hai
 The government should help them live independently
 hamaare desh main purnavas kendron kii dayaneey sthiti kisi se chhipi nahin he
 The sixth provision of the Bill is to increase discrimination
 ''isamen transgender samudaay ke vyakti ko alag se echivi nigaraanee or ling parivatarn kii kii vyavastha dene kii baat kahi gai he
 '' Dr
 silvia kahati hai, yah to bhedbhaav kam karne kii jagah ise badhaava dene jaise he
 Why a separate arrangement for them? Can they not treat people of other communities? Right now healthcare workers or doctors ask questions related to their sexuality and gender while treating any of their diseases
 zukam hone par bhi inhen sex life se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab dena padataa he
 Health care workers should try to end the feeling of discrimination against this community by training them for 'gender'
 vidheyak kaa saatvaan praavdhanto transgender samudaay kii maang ke bilkul ulat he
 According to this, people of the transgender community will have to get the identity certificate written in the box of the gender from the magistrate
 agar koi vyakti certificate main 'gender' badalawaanaa chahega to yah usee vyakti kaa badalegaa jisane ling parivartan kii surgery karwaai ho
 But the provision is going to increase the woes of the transgender community
 transgender samudaay ke liye self aaidentification yani transgender vyakti apane ling kaa pramann khud kar sake, aisa praavdhaan hona chahie
 Many times a trans person feels comfortable with the identity of another gender, apart from the innate gender identity, even without surgery
 to sawaal uthta he ki aisa vyakti kaise certificate paaegaa?kul milakar transgender samudaay ke hiton kii raksha ke daawey ke saath laae gaye is vidheyak ko lekar transgender samudaay ke bich gussa he
 Many organizations have started preparing for the demonstration to demand amendment in this bill
 *** The Arvind Kejriwal government and the power companies of the Aam Aadmi Party have come face to face with regard to electricity prices in Delhi

 agar bijli companiyon kaa daawa sahi he to iskaa matlab hoga dilli main aage chalakar bijli kii badi samasya, kyonki ye companiyaan bijli utpaadakon ko paise nahin de paaengi
 BSES has also said that banks are questioning our ability to return money
 media main ai khabaron se aisa lagata he ki sarkaar bijli kii daren ghataana chaahati he
 This has made them far away from us
 ve kah rahe hai ki ve hamen aage lone nahin de paaenge
 In the past, the country's largest power producer NTPC had also threatened to cut off power supply in Delhi due to non-payment
 dilli kii samasya yah he ki vah sirf 1,935 megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan karti he jabaki centre sarkaar kii companiyaan use 5,441 megawatt bijli detii hai
 The total requirement of Delhi is 7,500 MW
 bijli companiyon ne yah saaf kar diya he ki ve dilli ke bijli regulator ke adeshon kaa paalan karti hai or uske aadesh ko sarkaar ko bhi maananaa padegaa

 com / amzokbym36— Wimbledon (@wimbledon)july 16, 2017 The newly married couple of Sakshi and Ajitesh filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court seeking protection
 jisapar sunwaayee karte hue hoicourt ne somvaar ko sarkaar or police ko paryaapt suraksha pradaan karne kaa aadesh diya
 The court ordered registration of the UP marriage within two months, terming the marriage of both as legal
 hoicourt ne yah bhi kaha ki yadi niyat avadhi main shaadi kaa registration nahin hua to aadesh swatah nirast mana jayega
 Both got immediate protection from the High Court, but a question will also be faced in front of them, what now? The couple, who were alive in the shadow of fear, made the video viral, took media support, went to the High Court for protection , Will it get rid of it now? He himself is aware of this question, only then Ajitesh had also told in an interview to a TV that this security will not remain
 hoicourt se nikalate samay hui marpetsuraksha kii maang ko lekar daayar yachika par sunwaayee ke baad court se nikalate samay ajitesh ke saath marpet kii ghatana bhi hui
 The incident occurred when police was also present for security
 police marpet kii ghatana se inkaar kar rahi he, lekin khabaron ke mutabik is ghatana ke baad donon ko court main hi register ke kamare main baithaaya gaya
 On the directions of the High Court, the police took both of them from gate number two to Bamrauli Airport amid tight security
 bamrauli airport se donon ko helicopter se kisi agyaat sthaan par le jaaya gaya
 The newly married couple got immediate protection at the behest of the High Court, but the road ahead was not easy
 bareli ke is premi jode kii raah aage bhi chunautiyon bhari rahane vaali he
 Such an incident in the presence of the police suggests that Ajitesh's apprehension is not neutral
 shaadi kaa registration bhi hoga chunauteepurnis jode ke liye court ke aadeshaanusaar do maheene ke andar shaadi kaa registration karana bhi chunauteepurn hoga
 Sakshi's father Rajesh Mishra alias Pappu Bharathaul may not say anything or do anything after the matter has been uprooted in the media, but he belongs to the ruling party
 sattadhari dal ke vidhayak kii beti ke vivaah ke registration kii raah main bhi rode aa sakate hai
 The High Court has not given any instructions to the authorities in this regard
 duusari taraf pradesh sarkaar bhi tatasth he
 The Chief Minister asked for the report, but the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has summoned the report in this case, but not on the marriage or protection of Sakshi and Ajitesh
 mukhyamantri ne apni hi party ke vidhayak shyaam prakaash or pappu bhartol ke bich kathith chating kaa screenshot viral hone par gambhirtha dikhaate hue report talab kii he
 Political conspiracy is being feared behind this
 isse bhi spasht he ki sarkaar is maamle par tatasth rahanaa chaahati he
 This is the whole case, Sakshi Mishra, daughter of BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra alias Pappu Bharataul from Chainpur Bithri in Bareilly district, ran away from home with Dalit youth Ajitesh on July 3 and got married in a temple in Prayagraj, according to claims
 kuch roj pehle sakshi ne ek video viral kar apane pita se jaan kaa khatra bataate hue unase bachaane kii guhaar lagaai thi
 Sakshi and Ajitesh had also come to Aaj Tak's studio and made many allegations against the MLA family
 bareli police kii ek team donon kii suraksha ke liye dilli ai or elahabaad hoicourt main daayar yachika par sunwaayee ke liye prayagraj le gai thi
 Weddings in India are not less than any festival
 shaadi ko lekar ladki ke man main jahaan nai umangen janm le rahi hoti hai vahiin uske man main kai tarah ke andeh bhi umadte-ghumdate rahete hai
 The girl has to perform many types of customs
 saat pheron ke baad vah duusare ke ghar chali jaati he or yaheen se uski jindagi kii ek nai shuruyaat bhi ho jaati he
 In our country, couples are said to come from above
 lekin ek nae ghar main ladki ke liye sab kuch nayaa hota he
 He has to cherish many things anew
 bahut si chijen aisi bhi hoti hai jo uske saath pehali baar hoti hai
 These are the things most women have had to go through
 aise main agar bahut jaldi aapaki shaadi hone vaali he to ho saktaa he ki aapako bhi in baton se do-chaar hona padaa
 1
 jagane kaa samaybhale hi aap apane ghar main der se sokar uthati hon lekin is nae ghar main log aapse jaldi uthne kii ummid karte hai
 Getting up early in the morning is a major problem for most girls
 haalanki subah jaldi uthanaa aapako thodaa mushkil lag saktaa he lekin samay par uthakar taiyaar hone se baaki chizon ko nipataane ke liye aapke paas paryaapt vakt rahegaa
 2
 kya pahanen kya nahinye ek aisi samasya he jisase har ladki jeevanabhar juujhati he or ab to shaadi ke baad kaa pehla din he
 It is very difficult for every girl to decide what to wear and what not to wear the next day of marriage
 behatar hoga ki aap shaadi se pehle hi un kapadon ko taiyaar kar len jinako aapako agle din pahananaa he
 3
 pehla khanapako pehle din khaanaa bananaa hota he
 This concern often troubles girls
 unhen lagata he ki agar khaanaa bura ban gaya to log uske bare main kya sonchenge
 But it is not so
 jo kaam karen aatmavishvaas ke saath karen
 Everything will be good 4
 Mother-in-law has a great fear for the loving girl whether her mother-in-law will like her or not
 par yah ghabaraane kii baat nahin he
 You just need to be comfortable, the rest will happen automatically
 assam ke mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ne kaha he ki garibi or berogari dur karne ke liye sarkaar ko gramin ilaakon ke vikaas kii ore adhik dhyaan dena hoga
 At the inauguration ceremony of a women's hostel and guesthouse in Kahikuchi near Guwahati yesterday, Gogoi said that another way to eradicate poverty is to provide opportunities to youth from rural areas
 unhone kaha ‘purv main gramin ilaakon ke yuva rojgaar or anya sambandhit muddon ke liye die jane vaale surakshit laabh nahin le pate the
 In recent years our government has started many programs for employment generation and self-employment
 ’mukhyamantri ne kaha ki gramin ilaakon ke vikaas ke liye assam main panchayat raaj vyavastha ko majboot banane kii khatir yah kadam uthaae gaye hai
 He said that in the field of women's empowerment, the state's economy has changed drastically due to women associated with self-help groups
 sarkaar mahilaon ke kaushal vikaas ko badhaava dene ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Gogoi said that new courses would have to be introduced so that women and youth could be given skill training that would be relevant in today's market driven economy

 He was made a friend of the court of amicus curiae by the Supreme Court and asked to give all kinds of reports about the treasury
 bataaya jaataa he ki subramanium is baat se naaraaz hai ki unka pramotion karke supreme court kaa jaj kyon nahin banaaya gaya
 On Wednesday, he sent his resignation to Chief Justice RM Lodha without assigning any reason
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhen supreme court kaa jaj banane ke khilaaf sarkaar ne aawaaj uthaai thi jiske baad unhone apana daawa waapas hi nahin le liya balki yah bhi kaha ki vah vahaan tab tak practice nahin karenge jab tak justise lodha chif justise rahenge
 He is displeased with the attitude of the Chief Justice
 subramanium ne march main court ko apni report di thi or usamen unhone bataaya tha ki kis tarah se shahi khandaan vahaan ke khajaane se sona chura rahaa he
 He alleged that 26 kg of gold worth Rs 65 crore is missing from there
 court ne isaki jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 Surprisingly, Justice Lodha, who is hearing this case, has also removed his name from it and has referred the matter to another bench

 People from three Gond tribal-dominated villages of Madhya Pradesh's forestland Mandla district are strongly opposing the central government's proposal to start the proposed Chutka nuclear plant

 But as Chutka resident Dadulal Kudape points out, "in 2009, several resolutions were passed in the Gram Sabha

" par afsos kii baat he ki yahaan sarkaar kaa ravaiya ulataa he
 Patkar also cites a Supreme Court directive regarding the Omkareshwar dam in which the court remarked that "accepting compensation amount does not mean that the affected people have accepted all the conditions
" ''patkar or anya paryaavaran kaaryakarta prastaavit parmaanu sanyantr ke sarvaadhik bukamp sambhavit kshetra main padane ke kaaran vikiran ke khatre kii ore ishaara karte hai

 bijanour se ab indira bhaati kii jagah nasimuddin siddiki ko maidan main utaara gaya he
 Significantly, the Congress in its second list had given Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar a ticket from Moradabad
 haalanki suchi jari hone ke baad se hi aisi charchaathi ki raaj babbar muradabad se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai, balki fatehpur sikri se maidan main utarana chaahate hai
 From then on, the changing of the seat began

 It is worth mentioning that all the leaders of the Congress have been included in the list released so far
 priya dutt (priya Dutt) ko mumbai north central se chunaav maidan main utaara gaya he
 So at the same time, Savitri Bai Phule, who joined the Congress from the BJP, has been fielded from Bahraich in UP

 Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a subsidiary organization of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about a $ 16 billion (1) 77 percent stake in the flagship Indian online operator Flipkart by US retailer Walmart
 05 lakh karod rupee) main kharidne ko 'aniatik' or 'rashtrahit ke khilaaf' bataaya he
 The platform claims that the US retail company will 'kill' the Modi government's ambitious Make in India campaign

 The forum has said that surprisingly, the use of e-commerce is being used to attack the Indian market, defying the Sevolmartiniums
 ye baat note kii jaani chahie ki duniya main kahin bhi, walmart kaa koi market place model nahin he
 Manch has said that he is writing a letter to PM Modi with a heavy heart and requesting that he will intervene
 duusare deshon ke anubhavon or walmart, casco ke udhaaharan ke jariye manch ne multi neshnal companiyon dwaara gharelu companiyon ke adhigrahan ke itihaas kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The letter warns that the threat now stands at the door and may cause huge turmoil in the market
 iske saath hi patr main laghu or madhyam vyapaar, choti dukaane or zyada se zyada rojgaar paidaa karne ke maukey ke khatm hone kii bhavishyavaanee bhi kii gai he
 Manch has said, "we are confident that you will intervene and ensure that the person standing in the last row is protected
" vaishvik str par chah bade deshon ke baad walmart chini saamaanon kaa sabase ayatak he, or uskaa number saatvaan he
 "swadeshi Jagran Manch's co-convenor Ashwini Mahajan said that these acquisitions would prove to be the entry of multi-national companies in the multi-brand retail sector through e-commerce
 manch ne kaha, "in products main ve lagaataar nivesh karnaa jari rakhenge, jo hamaare chote or madhyam kaarobaariyon ko khatm kar denge
 And further, they will also kill the dream of Make in India
 ham ye bhi jaanate hai ki ve food ke multi brand retail main dilchaspee rakhte hai, or in donon kaa sanyukt upkram kisaanon ke hit ko khatm kar degaa
 "CPI (M) opposes the deal
 On the other hand, the Communist Party of India (marxist) has also opposed the flipkart-walmart deal
 party ke pravaktaa tikender panvar ne kaha ki jab bijepi vipaksh main thi, to usne multi brand retail main epadiai ko anumati dene ke upie sarkaar ke prastaav kaa jamkar virodh kiya tha or sansad ko chalane tak nahin diya
 But, now they are doing the same thing from the back door
 panvar ne kaha, "ham chaahate hai ki ye sarkaar is baat ko sunishchit kare ki chote vyapaariyon ko koi khatra na ho
 The Commerce Minister should give his response on this deal
 "unhone kaha ki single brand retail sector main epadiai ko lekar kuch niyam kaayade hai, lekin is maamle main or zyada satarkta kii jarurat he

 ab agar baat karen dilavaale kii, to usamen brands windo kii kaafii jagah thi or zaahir he abhinayta shahrukh jaise sulajhe hue bijnes main ne iskaa istemaal karke film ko kisi bhi risk se bachaaya hoga
 Anyway, this film is still doing good business, which will only increase due to holidays in the coming days
 iske alaava film kaa sangeet bhi kaaphi hit he or aise main music ritis se bhi film ko khaasaa munafa hua hoga
 The comments duusari taraf bajirao mastaani kii baat karen to yah film brands windo ke maamle main pichad gai, kyonki period film hone ke kaaran isamen aap kisi product kaa prachaar nahin kar sakate
 The money received through the brand window is a huge amount, for example, if we talk about Krrish 3, then this film earned around 100 crores only through the brand window, which is a big amount
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki kul milakar kamai ke maamle main koun si film baazi maarthi he, dilavaale yaa bajirao mastaani? saare aankade dekhen to abhi dilavaale faayde main nazar aa rahi he
 The thing to be noted here is whether both these films will prove to be a source of profit by removing their costs
 bajirao mastaani or dilavaale, in donon hi filmon kaa bajet kareeb 140 karod rupee ke aas-paas he or agar brands windo yani vah paisa jo film main istemaal kiye gaye products ke prachaar se kamaaya jaataa he, use chhod den or satellite ritis ko bhi alag kar den to dono filmon ko cinemagharon se apni laagat nikaalane ke liye kareeb 280 karod kamaane kii zarurat he
 Now, if we talk about Dilwale, then there was a lot of space in the brand window and it is obvious that a settled business man like actor Shah Rukh would have saved the film from any risk by using it
 vaise bhi yah film abhi acha kaarobaar kar rahi he, jo ki aane vaale dinon main chutteeyon ke kii vajah se badhegaa hi
 Apart from this, the music of the film is also a big hit and in such a situation the film would have benefited a lot from music rights
 tippaniyan On the other hand, when it comes to Bajirao Mastani, this film lags behind in terms of brand window, because you cannot promote any product in it because it is a period film
 brands windo ke zarie mila paisa ek badi raashi hoti he, masalan agar ham krish 3 kii baat karen to kareeb 100 karod is film ne sirf brands windo ke zarie kamaaye the, jo ki ek badi raashi he
 Now it remains to be seen that which film in terms of overall earnings wins, Dilwale or Bajirao Mastani? If you look at all the figures, it is visible in the benefits of the heart
 ab agar baat karen dilavaale kii, to usamen brands windo kii kaafii jagah thi or zaahir he abhinayta shahrukh jaise sulajhe hue bijnes main ne iskaa istemaal karke film ko kisi bhi risk se bachaaya hoga

 The raindrops are disrupting the morning peace in a small village in western Uttar Pradesh

 The villagers are inside the houses
 inamen zyaadaatar khetihar majdoor hai
 But the sound of an unfamiliar car coming from far away pulled them out one by one
 ve car ke peeche ho liye
 Eventually the car stopped in front of a rafted house made of pallet and brick and covered with polythene
 is makaan ne unke bhuule-bisare gaanv ko raturaat badnaam kar diya tha
 The most robbed in the entire village was the young man who was involved in the December 16 barbaric rape and murder scandal
 vah kareeb 11 saal kii umr tak yaheen palaa-badha tha
 The villagers were mentioning his name as brown and talking about him in different ways
 uski kad lathi, vajan or umr kaa byora alag-alag tha or aakhri baar uske gaanv aane ke bare main anumaan bhi bhinn the
 An old man with a wavy white beard said, "I haven't seen him for a long time," as if he was missing a fellow youth
 ek or sajjan hichakate hue bole, ‘‘kam-se-kam teen chaar saal to ho gaye, vaise bhura acha ladkaa tha
 "now the rest of the country considers this good boy to be the incarnation of evil
" televijan ke parade par braking news kii pattee main vah dikhaai detaa he
 The policemen take him along

 Ram Singh, the main accused of this gang rape, was found hanging in a trap in Tihar Jail on March 11 with a skylight
 tab se vah ladkaa hi is khaufnak jurm kaa pratinidhi cheharaa he
 Initially, the police described him as the bloodthirsty of the six accused and now India wants his vengeance
 maang ho rahi he ki adaalatein niyam badal de, uski umr ko nazarandaaj kar maut kii sajaa suna den
 The truth of his age is being debated
 kishor apradhi nyaay board ke baahar jutati bheed sawaal kar rahi he ki aisa aparaadh karne vaale 17 saal ke us ladke ko uske vayask saathiyon kii tarah hi sajaa kyon na di jaae

 Brown's trial began at the Juvenile Criminal Justice Board from March 6 and continued until July 5
 faisla 5 agast tak surakshit he
 For the past four months, the Brown Juvenile Criminal Justice Board sits just eight feet away from the victim's parents - 53-year-old Badrinath Singh and Asha Devi, 46, which shows their pain and helplessness
 unki 23 saal kii physiotherapist beti ke saath chalati bas main basant vihaar fliover se dilli gudgaanv express-ve par mahipalpur fliover ke bich balaatkaar hua or use berahami se peeta gaya
 Protests led to two consecutive weeks of protests at Delhi's India Gate
 aashaa devi kahati hai ki jab bhi ve us ladke ko dekhati hai to jindagi ke liye chatpataati beti kii yaaden taaja ho jaati hai
 On 29 December, when he died in a hospital in Singapore, the voices of instant justice became a storm
 badrinaath singh hataash swar main poochhate hai, ‘‘inhone jo kuch kiya sabake saamne he phir bhala fast trek adaalat ko inhen sajaa dene main saat maheene se bhi zyada vakt kyon lag rahaa he?’’ is kishor apradhi kaa naam lete hi aashaa kii halki aawaaj main jor aa jaataa he, ‘‘main to chaahati hum ki in saare rakshason ko, us ladke ko bhi maut de den
 "that girl has become a picture of a new, awakened and emerging India today

 The condition of the family in the two-room small kutcha house, the bunk on which Bhura's mother is sitting, has been demanded from the neighbors
 uskaa pati dimagi marij he jo ghutanon main thodhi ghusaae chupchaap saamne ke daravaaje ke kareeb duusari charpai par baitha rahata he yaa anapashnaap bolta rahata he
 There are two teenage girls and three young boys in this family of seven who have not received enough food for two days

 One of them broke up last week
 maa ne jabardastee muskuraate hue kaha, ‘‘kaash! main aapako kuch de sakati, phir bhi meri jindagi main aapkaa swaagat he
 As soon as he started talking about Brown, he had tears in his eyes
 uskaa yah pehla baccha 6-7 saal pehle ghar chhodkar chalaa gaya tha or bich main bas do baar kuch din ke liye aayaa tha
 Three years ago, the uncle came to the village for his wedding
 tab se use nahin dekha he
 Till two years ago he used to send money to mother, sometimes Rs 500 a month
 to kabhi zyada
 Then the money stopped coming
 maa buree tarah rote hue kahati he, ‘‘vah to gaayab ho gaya tha
 i did not even know his whereabouts until the police came here
 ’’use yaad nahin bhura kab paidaa hua tha
 Just remember that it was a rainy day
 vah bataati he, ‘‘mausam in dinon jaisaa hi tha, mere khyal se ab 16 yaa 17 baras kaa hoga
 The principal of the village's only primary school told the Juvenile Criminal Justice Board that according to school records, he was 17 years and 6 months old at the time of the crime
 police kii chargeshit main lagi register kii photocopy main uski umr kii taarikh 4 june 1995 thi
 But there is little evidence that there is no accurate record of birth
 gram pradhan kaa kahana he, ‘‘pakke taur par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa, ham apane bacchon ko skool le jate hai or headmaster sies ke hisaab se unki umr kaa andaja laga lete hai
 This is just a guess
 ’’lekin sies ke hisaab se umr kaa yah anupaat ab tak bhura kaa saath detaa rahaa he
 The boys in the village, who are still around 20 years of age, say that Brown was very young to them, and 14–15-year-olds say he was "slightly older" than them
 is tarah yah maamla asamanjas kaa he
 Whatever information is available, at least on the basis of it, the media reports seem to be wrong that to save Bhura, he is being manipulated at his age
 bhura kii maa kaa kahana he, ‘‘main uski maa hum, main to chaahati hum ki vah baahar aa jaae
 You can forgive him once
 usne dobaaraa aisa kuch kiya to main bhi use maaf nahin kar paaungi

 Then worked with a milkman in Kondli and then worked with a small bhathoor on the banks of Khoda bypass near Vaishali, Ghaziabad
 uske baad, ghadauli deyari farm main barkat dhabas main kaam karte hue vah phir parivaar se mila
 For four years he worked in this dhaba of Islamuddin
 vahaan vah khaanaa banane or safai ke kaam main haath bantaata tha or simit lekin niyamit graahakon ko khaanaa parosa karata tha
 The Barkat Hotel is an old-fashioned dhaba that people recognize by looking at it, which is not on any map and does not even have a board on its name
 log ek duusare se rasta poochhate hue, matan korma, dhimi aanch par paki nihaari, or keemaa gurde kii khushboo ke sahare eent-gaare ke is dhabas tak pahunch jate hai

 The kitchen used to start around 11 am
 fakhruddin incharge tha, bhura pyaaj kaatane or meet kaa masala taiyaar karne main madad karata tha
 Then he took care of one thing
 minute-minute main bataata tha ki rangath kaise badal rahi he or kab chalaanaa he, is bare main nirdesh kaa puraa paalan karata tha
 The first customer used to come around 1 pm and this would continue till 3:30 pm
 phir ve shaam tak ke liye dhaba band kar dete the
 The next three hours were spent sleeping, watching TV at the neighboring Naseem Kabaddi shop or gossiping among themselves

 Preparations for dinner started from 6:30 pm
 fakhruddin bataata he, shshwah kabhi khaane yaa kapade kisi cheez kii shikaayat nahin karata tha
 He had no friend in the neighborhood except us
 uske paas mobile phone nahin tha
 Was not fond of cricket or movies either
 kabhi ladakiyon kii baat nahin karata tha
 He was a common boy who was trying to survive
 uski shakhsiyat main aisi koi baat nahin thi jisase lage ki vah aisa kuch karegaa jaisaa usne kiya
 "even the non-government organization worker who understands brown regularly even says that he does not even touch alcohol, cigarettes or drugs
" barkat dhabas main kareeb chaar saal kaam karne ke baad ek din bhura ne islamuddin ko bataaya ki vah noida main apane chachaa ke ghar ja rahaa he, par uske baad vah lautakar nahin aayaa
 Shah Alam says, "he never went to his uncle's house
" uske chachaa kuch din baad uski talash main aae the
 He left three pairs of clothes and other belongings here
 kuch hi hafte baad uski maa bhi ai thi
 But we did not know where he went
 ’’ islamuddin, uske karmchaaree or scrap dealer naseem ne bhura ko bahut dhundha
 Naseem says, "someone said that he saw him in Vasant Vihar, so we went there in search of him
 vah ham main se ek tha
 We wanted to be sure of his safety
 ’’2012 ke disambar kii shuruyaat main samuhik balaatkaar kii ghatana ke kuch hafte pehle ek din achaanak uskaa phone aayaa
 Says Nasim, "he called me from an unknown number and said that i have to talk to Shah Alam
" lekin jab tak alam aae line cat chuki thi
 "he tried to talk to that number several times, but every time he got the answer that the boy is not there
" ‘‘hamane vah number uske chachaa ko de diya tha
 He was thinking of filing a complaint with the police
 lekin police tak jane se pehle hi balaatkaar kii khabar saamne aa gai thi
 Who knows, Ram Singh has called on that day, or the caller may be one of the other accused
 ’’police ab kahati he ki bhura ne 2011 main noida main shiv travel agency kii bas main ram singh ke saath ek khalasi ke rup main kuch maheene kaam kiya tha
 For eight months thereafter, Bhura worked in the 'daggamar' illegal bus service in Kaushambi opposite Anand Vihar Terminal
 daggamar bas seva kii basen uttar pradesh main khurja, saharanpur or muradabad ke bich chalati hai or unamem tikat ke naam par jarurat se zyada paisa vasula jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi yatriyon ko lut liya jaataa he
 "these buses are the breeding ground for children who turn to the world of crime," says Shahnawaz, counselor of the Haq Center for Child Rights
 ’’ uske baad vah root number 33 par chalane vaali bhajanpura-noida bas par khalasi ke rup me kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin dushkarm karne se do saptaah pehle uski naukari chhot gai thi
 Meanwhile, he met his old colleagues at Barkat Dhaba

 According to the statement of Avanindra Pratap Pandey, a 28-year-old friend of the victim who was in the bus at the time of the crime and the confessional statements of the accused, the boy was raped
 bal adaalat main pesh 56 pej kaa aaropapatr bhi isaki pushti karata he
 One of the other evidences against the boy is the blood stains of the victim on his clothes
 haalanki forensik report bas main uski ungaliyon ke nishaanon kaa sakshya pesh karne main naakaam rahi
 Asha Devi says, "my daughter did not specifically name her, but she said that all were equal partners in the crime
" vah sabase krur tha yaa nahin isse koi fark nahin padataa
 On July 23, two days before the Juvenile Justice Board gave a decision on reform by the Juvenile Justice Board, the Supreme Court approved the petition of Subramanian Swamy, President of the Janata Party, for a fresh interpretation of the word "kishore"
 swami ne sheersh adaalat ko bataaya ki unki yachika main yah baat rakhi gai he ki kisi kishor apradhi kii sajaa kaa faisla 18 varsh kii aayu seemaa kii kasuti ke bajaae uski ‘maansik or bauddhik paripakvata’ ke maddenjar hona chahie

 In view of this, the board has deferred its decision till 5 August
 udhar supreme court ke vakil karunaa nandi kaa kahana he ki 18 se kam umr ke aparaadhiyon ke prati adaalat ke vyavhaar sambandhi nirdesh acchhee tarah se soch-vichaar kar banaae gaye hai
 "unlike the adult crime justice system, there is no place for harsh punishment in the juvenile justice system
" maut kii sajaa yaa kathor sajaa kii baat nahin uthni chahie, kyonki adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki 18 se kam umr ke log apane aavegon par niyantran karne yaa dabaav sanbhaalane main asamarth hote hai
 "even after Brown comes out after following the instructions given by the court in the Child Improvement Home, there will be very little left to bring life before him
 shah alam kaa kahana he ki ve use apane dhabas par waapas kaam nahin de sakate or na hi koi or use kaam par rakhana chahega
 The head of the village of Bhura, who runs a small chemical factory next to his school, who left his studies midway, has been sitting on a plastic chair, wearing a T-shirt and pants, and other villagers around him
 Are sitting vah hiran ke ek bachche ko dulaar rahe hai jo kuch hafte pehle unke gaanv main bhatak kar aa gaya tha or kehete hai ki vah bhura ko apane is garib hi sahi lekin pavitra gaanv main nahin aane denge
 "you can also give a chance to a dacoit or an assassin, but it is better if he does not show his face after what he did
" use faansee kii sajaa ho yaa na ho, vah ladkaa hamaare liye mar chukaa he
 Foreign Minister SM Krishna again fell victim to a question about an 80-year-old Pakistani doctor in Ajmer jail and said that the Pakistan government should think about his release on humanitarian grounds
 rajyasabha main prashnkaal ke dauraan die gaye krishna ke is ajeeb jawaab se sadan main vipakshi sadsy asamanjas main pad gaye or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko hastkshep kar sthiti spasht kerani padi

 He came to India during 1992 to see his ailing mother
 krishna ne apane jawaab main kaha ki vah vyakti, pakistan main hiraasat main he or is sawaal par pakistan sarkaar ko ‘maanviya aadhaar’ par sochna he
 Hearing the answer, the members got confused
 tabhi mantri ne kaha ki dow
 Chishti is a wheelchair dependent and is over 80 years of age
 unhone kaha ki unhen puraa vishwaas he ki pakistan sarkaar is maamle main udaar rukh apnayegi
 The External Affairs Minister said that the matter will be continuously taken up at the High Commissioner level
 yah sun kar aashcharyachakit vipakshi sadasyon ne poocha ki krishna kis kaidi ke bare main bol rahe hai
 Marxist Vrinda Karat said that the minister could not understand the question and he was speaking about someone else
 vipakshi sadasyon kii tokataki ke bich pradhanmantri manmohan singh uthe or unhone kaha ki da chishti rajasthan main sajaa kaat rahe hai
 He said that he approached the Home Minister when he received a request for the release of Dr

 When the opposition members increased, Speaker Hamid Ansari arranged that nothing would go on record
 pradhanmantri ke hastkshep ke baad sabhapati ne kaha ki sthiti spasht ho gai he
 He then asked to ask the next question
 dow chishti kaa maamla haal hi main tab sukhiryon main aayaa tha jab ucchtam nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish markendeya katju ne unki maanviya aadhaar par rihaai ke liye vyaktigat taur par apil karte hue kaha tha ki unhen (da chishti ko) dil kii beemaari he or unke kuulhe kii haddi main fracture bhi he
 He had said, 'if he (dr
 Chishti) dies in jail, it will be a matter of utmost humiliation for India
 yadi unhen maafee de di jaati he to isse bharat kaa gaurav badhegaa

 aise main agar aap kisi company ke diarector hai or aapane gaiyr soochibaddh equity shares main nivesh kiya he to aapako itiar-1 form bharne kii anumati nahin hogi
 Also, if the employer fills Form 16 (TDS on salary) and Form 16A (TDS on other income) on an annual and quarterly basis, then the information of Form 16 and 26AS should ideally be the same
 lekin kai baar 26AS form or tip 16 yaa 16A ke aadhaar par inakam tex jaankaree match nahin karti
 This is due to incorrect information given by either the employer or the employee
 ab tex adhikari galat data yaa farji daavon par focus kar bariki se aisi jaankaree kii jaanch karenge or sambandhit karadaata ko notice bhejenge

 ) Many a times it happens that despite having girlfriends, boys want another girl for marriage
 agar aap bhi un ladakon main se hi hai to yah khabar aapkaa najariya badal sakati he
 Today is not the time when someone marries quietly without meeting anyone
 aaj ke samay main log pehle ek-duusare se milte hai, unhen parakhte hai or uske baad hi shaadi kaa faisla karte hai
 In such a situation, it becomes clear that no boy wants to marry a girl he does not know
 to aise main to aapaki garlfriend hi aapaki praathamikta honi chahie kyonki usase behatar aap shaayad hi kisi duusari ladki ko jaanate hon
 Marriage is a gamble in which there is a possibility of both victory and defeat
 aise main agar aap kisi anjaan shaks se shaadi kar lete hai to aapaki jindagi or bhi berang ho sakati he
 Some of the major reasons for marrying girlfriends: 1
 ham sabhi ke bheetar kuch achchhai or kuch buraai hoti he
 Our goodness comes in front of the world, but our negativity is not available to everyone
 ho saktaa he ki jo log aapke behad khaas hon jab unhenapake is negative rup kaa pataa chale to wo aapako chhodkar bhaag jaaenlekin aapaki garlfriend hi ek aisi shaks hoti he jo aapke saath har paristhiti main bhi khadi rahati he or aapke donon roopon ko samaan rup se sweekaar karti he
 In such a situation, can there be a better life partner than that! 2
 aapaki garlfriend hi aisi hoti he jo aapke har rup ko samaan rup se sambhalati he
 Whatever be the situation, it remains with you
 garlfriend se shaadi karne kaa vichaar isliye bhi swaagat yogya he kyonki vah aapke har mood or har vyavhaar ko samajhati he or use sanbhaalanaa jaanati he
 3
 jitne achche se aapaki garlfriend aapako samajhati hogi, utane hi behatar tareeke se aap bhi use samajhate hi honge
 In such a situation, it is a good thing for you that you will not have to try to understand a person again
 ho saktaa he ki kisi or ko jeevanasathi banane par uske or aapke vyavhaar main talmail na baithe
 In such a situation, it would be better to make your girlfriend your life partner
 sambhav he ki aisa karne se aapke jivan kii kai choti-choti samasyaayein khud hi dur ho jaaen
 Many eat vows in their name, and many laugh

 In fact, the then Union Minister Sukh Ram, accused of the telecom scam in the Congress government, may have crossed the age of 90 but he is ready to do anything to establish the third generation of the family in politics
 unhone ek baar or apni siyaasi nishtha badali he or apane pote aashray sharma ko bhaajapa se loksabhaa tikat na milane par ek baar phir congress kaa daaman tham liya he
 On one hand, they have given a blow to the BJP and the Congress has been forced to adopt them again
 jaahir he, yah kam se kam bhaajapa ke liye ek sabak he, jisane sanghathan se jude logon kii naaraazgi ke baavjood beete vidhansabha chunaav main sukhram ke bete anil sharma ko tikat diya or phir mantri bana diya tha
 The arrival of Sukhram has also led to an uneasy situation in the Congress as his relationship with former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has not been well
 darasal, yah ladaai mandi sansadeey seat ko lekar he
 This seat has been under the occupation of the dynasty of the traditional king-princes
 bushar riyasat ke raja or chah baar mukhyamantri rahe virbhadra singh yahaan se saansad rahe hai yaa phir unki patni pratibha singh
 From here, Maheshwar Singh of Kullu State has also been a BJP MP
 bhaajapa ke maujuuda mukhyamantri jairam thakur kaa gruhakshetra mandi hi he
 Once the by-election was held on this seat, Jairam Thakur was contested keeping in mind the Rajput fact
 lekin tab pratibha chunaav jeet gai thim kyonki virbhadra pradesh main mukhyamantri the
 At the same time, Sukhram contested as a Brahmin
 mandi par kabje ke chakkar main virbhadra or sukhram main than gai thi
 Sukhram then formed a separate party, Himachal Vikas Congress
 unhone hi 1997 main bhaajapa ke saath milakar pradesh main pehali baar gathbandhan sarkaar banaai thi
 Then BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal was the Chief Minister
 paanch saal bhaajapa ke saath rahane ke baad 2004 main sukhram ne phir se congress ke saath haath mila liya tha
 Then Sukharam's party got a seat in the Lok Sabha
 congress ne 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sukhram ko nishkasit kar diya tha
 However, his son Anil Sharma again became a part of the Congress and joined the Congress cabinet in 2012
 vahiin, 2017 main jab vidhansabha chunaav hue to anil sharma phir bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye
 Ashraya is the elder son of Anil Sharma, who is married to the cousin of cricketer Gautam Gambhir
 aashray ke liye sukhram ne edichoti kaa jor laga diya tha par jairam thakur or pradesh sanghathan ne faisla liya ki ve sukhram parivaar kii baar-baar badalati nishtha tathaa jid ke aage nahin jhukenge
 So Aashray did not get a ticket and Sukhram spoke directly to Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 congress ko bhi mandi se virbhadra ko munnt karne ke liye vikalp dhundhna tha
 Therefore, Rahul Gandhi gave ticket to the shelter without asking Virbhadra
 aise main mandi seat kii jang ab behad dilachasp ho gai he
 BJP MP Ramswaroop Sharma may be the candidate again, but Jairam Thakur's reputation is also associated here
 vahiin, virbhadra apane bete vikramaditya singh ke liye bhi yahaan se sambhaavnaaen dekh rahe the
 He will be impressed by the entry of Sukhram's grandson
 bahari taur par sukhram or virbhadra ne bhale hi ekta dikhaai he, par vyaktigat taur par virbhadra jis tarah jairam thakur kii tarif karte hai, saaf he ki congress kii raah aasaan nahin he

 a few hours after receiving his appointment as Defense Minister on 31st of May, 67-year-old Rajnath Singh called up Army Chief General Bipin Rawat

 singh ne shaayad is hakeekat kii duhai di ki rashtriya suraksha bhaajapa ke liye behad ahm mudda he
 This was the top issue in the 2019 election campaign, in which the Prime Minister strongly highlighted the air strikes that were carried out on 26 February at the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in khyber-pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan

 raksha mantralay kaa kaamkaaj nai sarkaar ke liye behad ahm hoga or khud singh kii parakh isse hogi ki ve apane kaarykaal main kya hasil kar pate hai
 The appointment of a political veteran on this position is an indication that the change in room number 129 of South Block has stopped repeatedly
 modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main yah cameraa paanch saal main teen ohadedaaron kaa gavaah bana
 But Rajnath Singh has more opportunity than any of his predecessors to mold the Ministry of Defense into a new mold
 haalanki raksha mantralay aatankwaad se jujh rahe kashmir main saamaanya halaat behaal karne ke liye kaam kar rahaa (sena ke jariye) ek saajhedaar bhar he
 Yet when it comes to the upper rungs, his role is important and topped
 uske chune vikalpon se yah tay ho saktaa he ki kashmir kii koi ghatana aantarik suraksha kaa maamla bani rahegi yaa badhkar bharat-pakistan ke bich puri jang main badal jaaegi
 This is a fact after the 26 February air strike, as an important strategic threshold has been breached in Balakot — the threshold that Prime Minister Vajpayee did not fear during Pakistan's nuclear weapons during the Kargil war of 1999
 
 mana jaataa he ki pulavama aatanki hamale kii ghatana kaa jawaab balakot kii air strike se—yani ek aise simit hamale se dekar jisane jawaab main parmaanu hamale ke liye nahin uksaaya—pradhanmantri modi ne parmaanu seemaa rekha ke vistaar kaa kaam kar diya he
 That is, they have brought it to a level that will lead Pakistan to prove its nuclear blackmail true

 However, for this to be a realistic alternative, India needs to deploy the full and all-round strength of its army
 yah sena ko bade paimaane par las or susajjit karke hi kiya ja saktaa he—us cheez ke liye susajjit karke, jise 'jang se itar karravaaiyaan' kaha jaataa he or jo kuch hi ghanton ke notice par amal main laai ja saken
 While on the chair of Home Minister, Singh has worked hard to create a pro-army image
 isaki khatir unhone ladakh main vaastavik niyantran rekha se satee sarahadi chaowkee par bharat-tibet seemaa police karmiyon ke saath yaa maowad se trast bastar main kendriya rigerv police bal ke javaanon ke saath raaten guzaarin
 He carried out a number of welfare works to elevate the armed forces on his own: allowing the jawans free air travel from Delhi to Srinagar, hardship allowances for paramilitary forces fighting left-wing extremists in Kashmir and central India (hardship Allowance), doubled the ex-gratia payment for the kin of the soldiers who died in the encounter and for the welfare of the soldiers Established 'bharat Ke Veer' Fund
 raksha mantralay main apana nayaa ohada sanbhaalane ke baad singh ne jo pehla kaam kiya, vah ek rank ek pension kaarykram main sudhaar ke liye or shaantikaal main adhikariyon ke rashan (jo 2017 main band kiye jane ke baad se hi sashastr balon ke sadasyon kii dukhati rag rahaa he) par kaam karne or ise behaal karne ke liye cameti bananaa he

 Before becoming a Lecturer in Physics at Post Graduate College, Singh had his ambition to join the Army as a Second Lieutenant

 kargil se pakistani ghuspaithiyon ko nikaal phenkane ke liye 1999 main 11 dinon kii jo ladaai ladi gai thi, uskaa ek nateeja yah bhi tha ki kargil samiksha samiti (kearsi) ne ek aitihaasik sainya sudhaar report taiyaar kii thi
 One of the biggest drawbacks that the committee highlighted was the lack of coordination between all the armed forces involved in the war and especially the army and air force
 kearsi ke nishkarshon kii jaanch-parakh ke liye banaai gai mantriyon ke samooh kii ek samiti ne bhi 2001 main is nishkarsh ko sahi tehraaya tha or sashastr balon ko raksha mantralay ke saath jodgaye or ek chif of dephence staff (sidies) niyukt karne kii sifarish kii thi
 In 2001, the Naresh Chandra Committee also suggested the need for an advisor between the government and the armed forces
 uske baad leftinent general di
 B
 shektakar samiti ne bhi 2016 main phir ise doharaaya tha
 But it was never implemented
 baharhaal, badlaav kaa shaayad yahi vakt he
 Just last year, with the rare consensus among the three services — Army, Navy and Air Force — a proposal for the appointment of CDS has been sent to the government
 yah behad ahm kadam he—sidies ke bagaiyr or vaaki sudhaaron ko unke nattejey par pahunchane ke liye jaruri raajnneetik dekharekh ke bagaiyr sashastr balon ko kargar banane or unhen 21veen sadi kii ladaaiyon ke taiyaar karne kii koshishen bekaar or naakaam ho sakati hai
 The CDS will integrate military forces and form 17 different command structures into three command-northern Command for China, Western Command for Pakistan and South Command for Marine Zone
 isse na keval sansadhano kii bachat hogi, sainya prabhaavashiltaa bhi badhegi
 Defense analyst Air Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam says, "the reason for the failure of the reforms in the last four or five years is that in order from the bottom to the top from the armies, that too was adopted in a piecemeal manner
 sheersh pratiraksha sanghathanon ko shaamil karke sudhaar kii prakriya upar se neeche kii ore honi chahie, jisamen rajnatik netritv jor dekar sudhaaron ko unke anjaam par pahunchaata he
 "there is an urgent need to carry out reforms immediately in the Ministry of Defense
 yah badlaav bhi keval rajnatik netritv hi laa saktaa he
 Former Director General of Military Operations Lieutenant General D

 bi
 Shektkar (retd), who has been the head of the reform committee of the mod — says, "rajnath Singh should avoid being fooled by bureaucracy
" mantralay ko nae sire se sangathit karne, uski dasha badalane or nae dhang se dhaancha banane kii sakchat jarurat he
 There is a need to reduce the number
 sankhya se kaarykushalta nahin badhati
 "replacing old equipment
 The bjp's 2019 manifesto promises to" speed up the purchase of defense-related equipment and weapons "and" take clean and quick steps to strengthen the offensive capability of the armed forces with modern equipment "
 isaki kis kadar fouran jarurat he, yah singh ke raksha mantri pad sanbhaalane ke kuch dinon baad 3 june ko daraavne dhang se saamne aayaa
 a military transport aircraft AN-32 crashed into the hills of Arunachal Pradesh
 isamen savaar sabhi 13 log maare gaye
 This was the tenth air crash of the Indian Air Force in the last six months, which worsened its peacetime record
 inamen se kai krash hue vimaanon kii udaan miyaad bahut pehle khatm chuki he
 Take the AN-32, for example, it was acquired in the 1980s and was to retire in the next few years
 duusare krash hue vimaanon main mig-21 or mig-27 shaamil hai or ye donon bhi dashakon puraane hai
 The AN-32 is likely to be replaced by the Airbus C-295, which is being built in India by tata-airbus
 yah pichley kareeb ek dashak se 'nirmaan kii prakriya main' he
 The recent deal for 56 aircraft, which was launched in 2009, stuck to the lowest price — the price the Defense Ministry was willing to put, much higher than it had been
 kul milakar teenon senaaon kaa 60 fisadi se zyada asalha purana or bekaar ho chukaa he or tatkaal badalane kii maang karata he
 The Air Force is in urgent need of 100 new fighter jets to strengthen its fleet against Pakistan and China
 nausena kaa pandubbiyon kaa bedaa bahut ghat gaya he
 At the same time, the list of needs of the army from anti-aircraft weapons stockpiles to logistics helicopters is already very long
 yahi vajah he ki sashastr balon ne beete ek pakhwaade main singh ko jo pregentation saunpe hai, unamem se zyaadaatar upkarnon kii talati aa rahi kharid se jude hai
 One of the pending requirements of the IAF is as old as Kargil Jung and it is 126 fighter aircraft, which can replace the crashing mig-21
 kargil ke baad senaaon ko aadhunik banane kii kavayaden bajet kii majaburiyon kii vajah se kaagajon par ataki hui hai, aise main talati aa rahi kharidon ke liye jaruri rakam, sashastr balon ke apane hisaab se, aasmaan chune lagi hai or kareeb 400 arab dollar (27 lakh karod rupye) par pahunch gai he
 In such a situation, the role of Rajnath Singh becomes doubly important
 ve tamaam sainya kharidon ko anivaary manjuuri dene vaali raksha kharid parishad ke bhi pramukh hai
 They have to do what their predecessors Manohar Parrikar and Nirmala Sitharaman did — they must prioritize essential equipment such as helmets, bulletproof jackets and assault rifles over acquisitions like ground-to-air missiles
 unhen sena or vaayu sena ke liye balakot ke baad kii apatkaaleen kharidon ko anjaam dena hoga, jinaki manjuuri pehle hi di ja chuki he
 For example, the Army needs to re-equip its Para-military Force units, which will cost around Rs 1,000 crore
 isi tarah vaayu sena ne aadhunik radio, hawa se hawa or jameen se hawa main maar karne vaali mixilon, jaimar or eideblooandsi vimaanon kii jarurat kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya he, jinamein se sabhi agle kuch maheenon main kharidne jaruri honge
 As one of the very few budget ministers, Singh's first task is to assess the funding needs of an army
 unke saamne aae pregentation kii badi taadaad, khaskar 5 july ko pesh hone vaale kendriya bajet main, zyada rakam muhaiyaa karwaane kii vakaalat karti he
 In a presentation presented to the Finance Ministry last week, the Armed Forces over and above the current defense budget 1
 5 lakh karod rupye kii jarurat bataai thi taaki behad jaruri kharidon ko anjaam diya ja sake
 All the plans to modernize the armed forces are stuck due to lack of cash
 masalan is farvari main pesh antarim raksha bajet 8 fisadi badhaakar 3
 01 lakh crore Rs
 kar diya gaya
 But this too was insufficient 
 ise samajhane ke liye jaananaa hoga ki 2018-19 main 30 fisadi rakam kam mili thi—3
 71 lakh crores
 kii jarurat ke mukaable 1
 12 lakh crore rupees was received
 singh jahaan in jaruraton ko lekar samvedansheel or prastaavon ko lekar khule hai, vahiin haal hi main unhone sahyogiyon se kaha, ''(sashastr balon ko) aisi maangen saamne nahin rakhni chahie jinhen ham keval aasmaan se taare todakar puraa kar saken
 "the question is - what should be done on insufficient funds for the armed forces?" Even if the purchase of new equipment is postponed, about 60 to 70 per cent of the capital budget of the Armed Forces is spent in accomplishing what are known as 'pre-promised liabilities'
 ye salanaa rakamen hai jo pehle kharide gaye upkarnon ke liye hathiyaar nirmaataaon ko chukaani hoti hai—usee tarah jaise automobile or ghar maalikon ko salanaa masik kistein chukaani hoti hai
 For example, the Air Force has to make a down payment of 36 Rafale aircraft purchased from France and S-400 missiles from Russia
 is tarah ke muddon ke chalate raksha mantralay ke kharchon main kisi bhi badhotaree par anadhikarik simarekha khinch di gai he
 In this context, last year the Minister of State for Defense Subhash Bhamre had said in the Lok Sabha that 18 percent of the government's expenditure already goes to defense
 (unke is aankade main raksha pension ke 1 lakh karod rupye bhi shaamil the, jo aam taur par sashastr balon ke bajet main shaamil nahin hote
 ) If the Armed Forces are expected to be ready for other battles like Kargil and Pulwama, Singh will have to fight — and win — this battle of the budget
 mek in indiamodi sarkaar ke pichley kaarykaal kii sabase badi naakaamiyon main swadesh main hi hathiyaar banane kaa mek in india kaarykram tha jo murda hi paidaa hua
 Make in India has essentially two parts
 ek he ranneetik bhagidaari (espi) jisamen bhartiya nijee kshetra se videshi hathiyaar nirmaataaon ke saath kaamkaaji rishte kaayam karke swadeshi hathiyaar utpaadan udyog viksit karne kii ummid kii jaati he
 The second part is to develop from this first part — once the manufacturing base is established, it will be expected to invest in weapons research, 'developed and manufactured in India' weapons platforms, or IDDM projects
 in pariyojnaon main bauddhik sampada—hathiyaaron ke khaake, military software or isi kism kii chizon—par puri tarah bhartiya companiyon kaa niyantran hoga
 The strategic partnership program was launched by the then Defense Minister Parrikar in 2016 and aimed to bring the Indian private sector to the task of building tanks, helicopters, fighter aircraft and submarines
 is pramukh niti par abhi raksha mantralay kii manjuuri kii mohar laganaa he
 This strategic partnership policy is circling the corridors of South Block
 is saal hathiyaar ayatak deshon kii vishwa ranking main haalanki bharat khiskkar duusare paaydaan par aa gaya he—or aisa keval isliye hua he kyonki saudi arab ne apni raksha kharid main ijapha kiya he—tis par bhi bharat apane 60 fisadi se zyada raksha hardware ab bhi aayaat karata he
 There are a lot of challenges facing Rajnath Singh and there are also very heavy ones
 is ohade par unke saamne darpesh inamen se kai gutthiyaan unke purvavartiyon ko pachhad kar chuki hai
 If the lions overcome them, they will confirm their pedestal in history
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne aaj in khabaron ko betuka bataaya ki congress netaa shashi tharur sansad main kulbhushan jadhav par padhe jane vaale ek bayaan kaa masauda taiyaar karne main narendra modi sarkaar kii madad karenge
 Sushma tweeted and said, there has been no famine of talent in my ministry
 mujhe bahut sakasham sachivon kaa sahyog praapt he
 She also posted the news to which she was responding
 khabaron ke mutabik purv videsh rajya mantri tharur kulbhushan jadhav ke mudde par sarkaar ko ekajutata kaa bayaan kaa masauda taiyaar karne main madad karenge
 According to the news, Sushma Swaraj's request for drafting of the statement came after Parliament condemned Pakistan for the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 nausena ke purv adhikari jadhav ko pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne jasusi or vidhvansak gatividhiyon main sanlipt rahane ko lekar maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 Sushma earlier in the day said in both houses of Parliament, there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav
 isse pehle is mudde par charchaa ke dauraan khadge ne kaha ki yadipakistan jadhav ko faansee detaa haito yah 'purv-niojit hatya' hogi
 No one was allowed to meet Jadhav
 use yahaan tak ki apana maamla ladane ke liye vakil bhi nahin diya gaya
 No international rules were followed
 bhaajapa netaa nishikant doobe ne maang kii ki sadan main pakistan ko aatankwaadi raashtra ghoshit karne ke liye ek prastaav paarit kiya jaae
 He said that India has put Pakistan in trouble on the issue of terrorism and that is why the neighboring country is busy insulting the Indian
 eimm sadsy asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha kibharat ko jadhav ko bachaane ke liesb kuch karnaa chahie
 The military court of Pakistan sentenced Jadhav without any evidence
 bharat ko unhen bachaane ke liye har antarrashtriya manch kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy condemned Pakistan's act and praised India's side on the issue
 unhone kaha ki bharat or bharatiyon ke khilaaf pakistan badale kii bhaavana se karrwai kar rahaa he
 The government should take every step to save Jadhav's life
 biju janata dal (bijd) ke bi
 Yes
 pandas ne kaha ki jadhav ke mudde par bharat ko vishwa nyaayalay or sanyukt raashtra se sampark karnaa chahie
 He said that Pakistan is not a normal country
 yah sainya santhaan dwaara chalaaya jaataa he or is tarah ke krityon se ve hamaare desh ko asthir karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan will not be able to play in the second Test cricket match against England starting in Trentbridge from Friday, while the play of opener Gautam Gambhir is also doubtful
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki jahir is match main nahin khelenge
 His right thigh muscle was stretched during the first test
 usamen kaaphi sudhaar dikh rahaa he or unke tisare test match tak feet hone kii sambhaavna he
 Dhoni said on the eve of the match, 'gambhir's play is also doubtful
 ham use kuch or samay denge
 It depends on how much pain he can play despite suffering
 ’ gambhir pehle test match ke dauraan mat praayar ke shaat par ghayal ho gayi the
 He was hurt on his right elbow and it is believed that he still has pain in his elbow and is not fully fit
 gambhir ne haalanki nets par ballebaaji kii
 He could not practice on Wednesday
 yadi gambhir nahin khel pate hai to phir yuvaraj singh ko antim ekadash main jagah banane kaa mauka mil jayega
 However, it will be difficult for India to decide who will start the innings with Abhinav Mukund
 bharat haal main choton se jujhataa rahaa he or dhoni ne kaha ki kabhi kabhaar hi aisa ho paaya jabaki vah test maichon main apni majboot team utaarne main safal rahe
 He said, 'our team has had to deal with this problem continuously
 jab bhi ham khelte hai tab hamaari sabase majboot team nahin khel paati he
 This is happening continuously
 ’bhartiya ballebaajon ne lords main donon pariyon main 300 se kam ran banaaye lekin dhoni ko duusare test match main kaaphi sudhaar kii ummid he
 Dhoni said, "we need good partnerships, not just one batsman
" 50 yaa 100 ran kii saajhedaariyon se vastav main pari ko aage badhaane main madad milegi
 "it is also important for the batsmen to convert their good start into a big score," he said
 nichle kram ke ballebaajon ko bhi apane wicket kaa mahatv samajhnaa hoga or yadi ve 40 se 60 ran bhi banaate hai to unase kaaphi madad milegi
 Dhoni said, 'we have done this before and we will do our best
 ’ bhartiya captain ne kaha ki bharat ko yadi match par dabadabaa bananaa he to pehali pari main acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 He said, 'it will be important to do well in the first innings
 dekha gaya he ki jab team team ko 100-120 ran kii badhat mil jaati he to duusari team ke liye vaapasi karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 'india is in danger of losing the status of the world's number one Test team but Dhoni said that they are not worried about it
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi aap khel kaa lutf uthaate ho to reating swayan aapaki parvaah karegi
 This is a regular process
 koi bhi hameshaa number ek nahin bane rah saktaa he
 How you get there is important
 jab aap vahaan pahunch jate hai to use kaayam rakhana mushkil hota he
 Dhoni admitted that the team performed better as the series progressed and never really played well at the start
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare ballebaaj, gendbaaj or kshetrarakshak paristhitiyon se saamanjasy bithaane ke saath acha pradarshan karte hai

 Famous Hindi film lyricist Shakeel Badayuni is known for his films' romantic and painful songs
 is geetkaar ne 1944 ke baad naushaad ke liye kai aise geet likhe jo aaj bhi behad mashhoor hai
 Begum Akhtar also sang Shakeel's ghazals
 dard, prem or romance shakeel kii shaayari kii pahchaan he
 Shakeel was born in Uttar Pradesh's Badaun area of ruhelkhand, which is still famous for three things
 ye ilaaka peda, poetry or pir ke liye janaa jaataa he
 It is the same area where the famous 13th century Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya was also born
 yahaan kii dargah choti jiyaarat or badi jiyaarat ke rup main jaani jaati he
 Millions of people come here every year for Jiyarat
 jabaki yahaan ke doodh se bane bhure rang ke pedo ke swaad kaa koi sani nahin hai
 There is a large list of authors poets in the form of Ismat Chughtai, Jilani Bano, Dilawar Figar, Ali Ahmed Surroor, Bekhud Badayuni, Ada Jafri, Phani Badayuni and Shakeel
 mumbai kii filmi duniya tak shakeel ke safar main badaayun kii parampara, saahitiyik viraasat or adab kii jhalak najar aati he
 Born on 3 August 1916 in Badaun, Shakeel's father Mohammad Jamal Ahmed Qadri wanted his son to be better prepared
 iske liye unhone ghar par hi arabi, urdu, farsi or hindi ke tution kii vyavastha kii
 There was no atmosphere of poetry in Shakeel's house
 haa, shakeel ke ek dur ke rishtedaar dharmik shaayar the
 Begum Akhtar: 44 years after her death, Avadh University, Shakeel will set up a music academy at a cost of 60 crores, the impact of the shayari of Badaun and a relative apart from the home environment
 ve shaayriyaan karne lage
 But he was identified as a poet after leaving Badaun
 1936 main jab shakeel padhai ke liye aligarh muslim uniwarsity pahunche, tab unhone college or vishvavidhyalayon ke mushaairon main jamkar hissaa lenaa shuru kiya
 He was married to Salma in 1940
 haalanki grajuation puraa karne ke baad supplai officer ke rup main shakeel dilli pahunch gaye
 Despite his job, he continued to go to Mushayars
 shakeel shuruyaat se hi apane daur ke shaayaron se bilkul alag the
 While his contemporary poet was writing on social and political events, the subject of Shakeel's poetry was only pain and romance
 filmi geeton ke lekhan main bhi shakeel kii yahi khaasiyat najar aati he
 It can be understood in a lion of Shakeel - i am Shakeel Dil Ka Tarjuma, i am a lover of love, i am sorry that my poetry, not apart from my life, a line made Kamashkil work in films for almost four years
 Stayed in Delhi
 unki jindagi main 1944 ke dauraan wo vakt aayaa jab unhone filmon main likhane kii thaanee
 He quit his job to become a film lyricist and moved to Mumbai
 yahaan aakar unhone film nirmaataa eaar kedaar or sangeetkaar naushaad se mulaaqaat kii
 Naushad asked Shakeel to state his poetic skills in a line
 unhone kaha-"ham dard kaa afasana duniya ko suna denge, har dil main mohabbat kii aag laga denge"begum akhtar, jinhone ghazal ko banaaya apana gahanaa25 saal tak naushaad ke saath kamiske baad jo kuch hua wo bollywood main ek itihaas jaisaa he
 The couple of Shakeel and Naushad worked together for over 20 years and gave many excellent films
 donon ne didaar, baiju baavaraa, madar india, mogul-e-ajam, dulaari, shabaab, ganga jamuna or mere mehboob jaisi filmon main saath kaam kiya
 Romance and pain can be felt even today in his songs
 shakeel ne zyaadaatar naushaad ke saath kaam kiya, par unhone kai duusare sangeetkaaron kii dhunon par bhi geet likhe
 He also worked under the music direction of Ravi and Hemant Kumar
 film "gharaana" kaa geet "hushnavaale tera jawaab nahin" ke liye shakeel or ravi ko best geetkaar or best sangeetkaar kaa filmphere mila
 Shakeel's other important films with Ravi were Chaudhavi Ka Chand
 is film ke tital gane ke liye shakeel ne 1961 main best geetkaar kaa film fere aword jeeta tha
 Shakeel's biggest hits were Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam with Hemant Kumar
 shakeel ne apane filmi kariyar main kareeb 89 filmon ke liye gane likhe
 She also wrote many such ghazals which Begum Akhtar gave her voice and she became very famous
 naushaad ke saath gahari dostinaushad kii dhunon par gaanaa likhane vaale shakeel baad main unke gahare dost bhi bane
 After meeting Shakeel for 25 years, Naushad got most of his songs written by Shakeel
 baiju baavaraa donon ke kariyar kii behtareen film he jo apane geet or sangeet ke liye aaj bhi yaad kii jaati he
 However, the film's director Vinay Bhatt wanted the poet Pradeep to write the song in it
 naushaad ko jab pataa chalaa to unhone vinay se anurodh kiya ki ek baar shakeel ke likhe ko sun len
 And after listening to Shakeel, Vinay agreed to Naushad
 dilwaai 10 guna zyada fisanushaad or shakeel kii dosti kaa ek or kissa mashhoor he
 Actually, Shakeel got TB disease and was in digestion for treatment
 naushaad jaanate the ki unki aarthik haalat bhi kharaab he
 Naushad got Shakeel three films
 bataate chalem ki in filmon ke liye naushaad ko unki saamaanya fees se 10 guna zyada bhugtan kiya gaya
 Apart from Naushad, Shakeel also had friendships with musicians Ravi and Ghulam Mohammad
 bombai hospital main ilaaj ke dauraan 53 varsh kii aayu main shakeel kii maut ho gai thi
 Strong storm and storm in North India have also hit the mountainous state of Uttarakhand
 yahaan mausam ne ek baar phir ne karavat lee he
 Police control room and fire brigade continued to receive information on tree fall in several places due to strong storm and rain in Dehradun
 yahaan musuri kshetra main kohlukhet ke paas ped girane kii vajah seyatayaat baadhitahua
 Later the path was restored by cutting down trees and with the help of JCB
 iske alaava panditwari or lalatppad kshetra main ghar ke upar ped girane se diwaar kshatigrast ho gai
 After getting the information, the police station and the fire brigade team reached the spot and removed the fallen trees with the help of sophisticated tools
 aisa hi haal chamoli ke karnaprayag kaa bhi rahaa jahaan ek baribharakam ped tufaan kii vajah se bich sadak par gir gaya
 Due to this, passengers and local residents on both sides were stranded with their vehicles for a long time
 baad main privet jesibi kii madad se ped ko hataaya gaya or rasta kisi tarah se khulwaaya gaya
 On Bageshwar Almora High Way, a huge tree fell on the road, due to which tourists remained stranded for a long time

 It has become clear from this that at this time more rains are going to hit the districts of Kumaon division
 pichley alert se sabak lete hue is baar prashashan puri tarah se mustaid nazar aa rahaa he
 The Chief Secretary has instructed all the District Magistrates in the entire state to take precautions

 ipel-6 ke final match se ek din pehle 25 may kii raat 9
 30 AM BCCI President Ann
 shrinivasana kaali or safed dhariyon vaali tii-shart main chah bounsaron se ghire kolkata ke taj bengal hotel main sabase ant main pahunche the, jahaan jagmohan daalamia kii mejabani main ratribhoj diya gaya tha
 Srinivasan entered the reception area along with Dalmiya and IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla
 pehle to daalamia bataate hai ki kaise 1997 or 2000 main jab pehali baar match phixing ke aarope lage the, tab purv bisisiai adhyaksh rajsingh duungarpur or e
 C
 muthaiya ne istipha dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 He then appealed to Srinivasan to resign on moral grounds, as his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan is himself in police custody on charges of betting and match fixing
 shrinivasana bole, 'peeche hatana meri fitrat main nahin he
 Shukla said that it is fine, now this will not be said to them
 achaanak 28 may ko sambhavat: congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke is maamle main dakhal dene se congressiyon main afratfari much gai
 The campaign was first started by Jyotiraditya Scindia, President of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association, who was taken over by Union Sports Minister Jitendra Singh and the responsibility of taking it forward was taken by Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Shukla, the head of Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association
 iske fouran baad ensipi ke mukhiya, purv bisisiai adhyaksh or kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne bhi unke sur main sur mila diya
 Right late, but this collective attempt to flirt with Srinivasan suddenly shows that the BCCI is doing this to protect itself
 mahaj 30 logon kii bapauti bana yah sanghathan, jisamen harek ke paas ek vot he, khud ko bachaane ke liye jo kar saktaa he, sab kar rahaa he taaki bahari dakhal se uskaa daaman bachaa rahe
 The question still remains, who will tie the bell in the cat's neck? How will people like Arun Jaitley and Shukla, who called a secret meeting at their Kailash Colony residence in a hurry on May 28, arrange the votes needed to oust a popular BCCI president? Srinivasan, vice-chairman and MD, India Cements, called for the working of the patronage and concessions to be implemented tomorrow during his seven-year engagement with the BCCI
 By turning in had made the air in your favor
 unki sabase badi uplabdhi yahi he ki rajya sanghon se lekar khiladinnon tak or camentataron se lekar purv cricketron tak sabaki bhagidaari se kheli gai chuppi kii ek sajeesh ke ve sargana hai
 During his tenure, he has gained strength by distributing roveries
 team india ke khilaadiyon kaa paarishramik prati test match 2
 In 2010, he had done Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7 lakh
 purv gharelu or antarrashtriya cricketron ko 25 lakh rupee se 1
 He distributed a one-time bonus of up to Rs 5 crore in 2012
 logon main cricket ko lekar dharna banane vaale camentataron, sunil gavaskar or ravi shastri, ke saath unhone salanaa 3
 6 crore central contract
 kinare baithkar tamaasha dekhne vaale rajya cricket sanghon ko lubhaane ke liye unhone 2006 main unke rahanuma purv adhyaksh daalamia ke khilaaf lage aniyamitata ke aaropon ko khatm karwaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Like Dalmiya, Srinivasan has benefited the people so much that the language of Jaitley and Shukla could not be moved until the IPL final on May 26
 bisisiai ke sheersh adhikariyon main harek ko kisi na kisi tareeke se shrinivasana se laabh mila he
 On May 29, former BCCI president Pawar made the statement that Srinivasan was not showing seriousness in dealing with 'malicious acts'
 'dilachasp yah he ki sitambar, 2008 main bisisiai ke samvidhan ke upbandh 6
 2
 4 main vivaadaaspad sanshodhan kaa kaam tatkaaleen adhyaksh pavaar kii likhi ek chitthee ke aadhaar par hi hua tha, jiske tahat bisisiai ke padaadhikari bhi team ke maalik ho sakate hai
 Due to this amendment, Srinivasan was able to bid for Chennai Super Kings
 pavaar ne 5 janvari, 2008 ko shrinivasana ko likhaa tha ki unhen 'boli prakriya main india cements ke hissaa lene main koi baadha najar nahin aa rahi he
 After this, another change in the constitution on 15 September 2012 cleared the way for Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) chief Arun Jaitley to become president in 2014
 isamen roteshan pranali ko hataa diya gaya, jiske mutabik board kaa aglaa pramukh purvi jone se aana tha
 After this, another change was made in Rule 15 (6), under which the former Board President could be re-elected to the Board
 isse na sirf shrinivasana balki pavaar, ai
 s
 bindra, daalamia or shashaank manohar ke board main bane rahane kaa rasta khul gaya
 "when you talk about BCCI, the most important thing to understand is that it is control, not cricket," says a senior official of the controlboard, not cricket
 bisisiai khel or khilaadiyon ke liye nahin, khud ke liye astitv main he
 It is a fortress built on the fear of power, money, chaos and the insecurity of ending everything
 'bisisiai aaj ek korporate sanstha ban chukaa he, jisaki kul parisampattiyaan 3,308 karod rupee kii hai or jiske paas salanaa 382 karod rupee kaa sarplus he
 Peek into it is two to four with contradictions
 ek ore, yah ek aise aadhunik khel ko chalaata he jiske har ek pahalu se iskaa vaasta hota he— superstar khilaadi, tivi par prasaaran adhikaar, praayojak, marchendyse, media kaa dhyanakarshan, logon or chaahane waalon kaa vishaal janaadhar
 On the other hand, it rests on the old model with honorary members in its rule, chosen from a two-tier system
 unhen rajya sangh vot dete hai or jahaan koi peshewar prabandhak nahin hota
 An agent of the players who have been close to the board for more than a decade says, 'this is the monarchy of the capitalists operating under the cover of democracy
 yah van-main sho he, jahaan har saal badshaah kaa takhtapalat hota he lekin dhaancha jas kaa tas bana rahata he
 'till 2006, this board used to run from the chairman's house
 iskaa mukhyalay mumbai ke breaborn stadium ke bahari ilaake main sthit dedh kamare kaa ek daftar hota tha
 The situation was that if a visitor needed to use the toilet, he had to ask the office manager Dalpat Vadolikar for the key to the Badbubar toilet located on the first floor, which was rented from another office
 aaj bisisiai kaa aaleeshaan daftar vankhede stadium main sthit cricket centre main he, jisamen aadhunik shauchalay bane hue hai
 Apart from this, everything else is the same
 bisisiai kii ahm upasmitiyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai vitt samiti, vipanan samiti, ipel kii prashaskeey parishad or tour or fikschar samiti jo maichon ke aayojan sthal tay karti he
 These include members of 27 state associations
 board ke ek adhikari kehete hai, 'isamen na to kisi ek vyakti, na hi kisi samooh kii jimmedaari hoti he
 They sign only on empty space
 saare faisle adhyaksh yaa sachiv lete hai or yah is par nirbhar karata he ki donon main se kiskaa prabhaav zyada he
 'many ICC presidents have appealed to the BCCI several times, especially between 2003 and 2006 by Pakistan's Ehsan Mani, to appoint professional people to the board, but the board refused to accept this advice
 andar ke logon kii raay main board ko dar he ki peshewar logon ke aane se unki satta main dakhal hoga
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken had tried to bring the BCCI under the Sports Bill in 2012 to come under the Right to Information Act, but the proposal was dropped before it went to Parliament
 prayek rajya sangh vot dene vaale ek sadsy ke maatahat hota he or bisisiai ke munaafe se apana paisa letaa he
 This money is disbursed annually and even though there is a formula to decide who will get from the 'IPL grant' and 'TV subsidy', these days these amount would be between 25 to 30 crores for each union
 Is only adhikari kehete hai, 'kuch chote sangh jinka salanaa vyay is raashi kaa chota-sa hissaa hota he unhen unke bank khaaton main paisa bhej diya jaataa he or ve ise kaise kharch karte hai, is bare main unase koi sawaal nahin kiya jaataa
 'to maintain this comfortable position, the chairman keeps the members of his board happy ie votes
 aisa kai tareekon se kiya jaataa he
 In the '90s, Dalmiya worked to fine-tune these methods and transformed them into an art form by Srinivasan over the last two years: handing important matches against Australia, South Africa and England to state associations To give its members dominance in the disbursement of money and passes from local sponsorship; Grant for stadium construction and academies; Sending important members from state associations as managers on foreign tours whether they have professional experience or not; Keeping the committee meeting around the big matches, so that members can pay the entire cost of coming to the stadium to watch these matches, including business class travel, accommodation in a five-star suite and a daily allowance of Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000
 Etc
 in revadiyon ke baavjood bisisiai main apane samarthan main sankhyabal jutaney kaa kaam hameshaa se hi gopneey or shadyantr bharaa rahaa he, jahaan har chunavi saal main dost achaanak dushman ban jate hai, jahaan sameekaran bahut teji se badalte hai lekin chehre vahi rahete hai
 Dalmia and Bindra have fought together and against each other over the years; The same has happened between Dalmia and Muthiah, Muthiah and Srinivasan and Srinivasan and Lalit Modi
 paise kaa khelbisisiai kii sthapana disambar, 1928 main tamilnadu societes registration act ke antargat ek nijee club ke taur par hui thi
 However, the battle for control has always been there, where the struggle of Maharaja Kumar of Patiala, Viceroy Lord Willingdon and Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagaram came to light only in 1931
 lekin bharat main udaarikaran ke baad yah jang galakat ho gai, jab prasaaran adhikaron se paisa aane laga
 To recognize the turning point in the history of BCCI, remember November 1991, when the South African team came to India to play their first international match after being freed from the 21-year-old racial ban
 teen maichon kii is ekadivasiy siries se ekaadh saptaah pehle dakshin africa cricket board ke mukhiya ali baakar ne bisisiai ke tatkaaleen secretary daalamia ko phone kar ke poocha tha ki dakshin africa main maichon ke prasaaran par kitni laagat aegi? bisisiai ko pataa hi nahin tha ki prasaaran adhikaar kiske paas he, sarkaar ke paas yaa khud uske paas?kai daur kii vaarta ke baad bisisiai ne akalan kiya ki is siries kaa prasaaran adhikaar 10,000 dollar prati match ke daam par bechaa ja saktaa he, lekin baakar ne jab puri siries ke liye 60,000 dollar dene kii peshkash kar di to daalamia ne bina chuke chakka maar diya or sauda 120,000 dollar par jaakar rukaa
 During the last match on 14 November at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, Biker handed over a check of the South Africa Broadcasting Corporation to Madhavrao Scindia, the then chairman of the BCCI
 yah pehali baar tha jab kisi videshi prasarak ne bharat main hui siries ke liye bisisiai ko bhugtan kiya tha
 After 22 years, the Star Group has paid Rs 3,851 crore to the BCCI in exchange for the broadcast rights for cricket matches on Indian soil between 2012 and 2018
 yah fees 2012 se 2014 ke bich prati match 32 karod rupee baithti he or 2014 se 2018 ke bich har match par badhkar 40 karod rupee ho jaati he
 
 board banaam bahriapanon ko bachaa le jane or bahari vyaktiyon ko nibata dene kii bisisiai kii niti ipel ke purv chairman lalit modi ke arsh se farsh par aane ke udhaaharan se samajhi ja sakati he
 The 49-year-old former Twenty20 king of Twenty20 cricket, through his political contacts, made his way to the club through his political connections, living in seclusion in London
 
 In Rajasthan, a new sports bill introduced by the then Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje became the medium of victory of Modi in the elections of Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) in 2005
 isamen jila sanghon tak matdaan ko simit kar diya gaya tha or kathith taur par ek fatwa jari kar diya gaya tha ki unhen modi ko samarthan dena he
 As a result, Modi became a part of the BCCI and the board embraced him just as every newcomer has been doing
 saamaanya dharna yah he ki modi kii dikkatein us vakt shuru huin jab 2010 main unke khilaaf aniyamita or vittiya herpher ke aarope lage, lekin asal main unke sankat kii shuruyaat us vakt hui jab ve aaarasie ke ek vivaadaaspad chunaav main iees afasar sanjay dikshit ke haathon adhyaksh kaa pad haar gaye
 The new Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had his hand on Dixit's head
 ab modi bisisiai ke andruni maamalon kaa hissaa to ban chuke the, lekin unke paas matadhikaar nahin tha isliye vahaan tak unki pahunch baadhit ho gai
 Secondly, the IPL had already stood on its feet
 modi kii jarurat ab nahin rah gai thi
 For the second time in 2010, as soon as they lost the RCA election, their game was over
 board ke ek sadsy kehete hai, 'jinke paas vot nahin hai, bisisiai main unke liye koi jagah nahin
 'srinivasan's real impact comes from being a man within the board and a strong grip on the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association
 jacket or taai yaa phir safari suut main lakadak or karine se bal jhaad kar hameshaa taiyaar rahane vaale 68 varshiya shrinivasana peshey se chemical ejeeniyar hai, jinka pehali baar vellore se 2001 main tiensie main pravesh hua
 He took command of this for only one year in 2005 at the behest of his friend Muthiah, but never let Muthiah enter it again
 ve 2012 main aathvin baar lagaataar tiensie ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 Today Muthiah is saying that bringing Srinivasan into cricket was his' biggest mistake
 'in barason ke dauraan shrinivasana ne bade khilaadiyon ko anugrahit karne kaa kaaphi kaam kiya he
 His special relationship with Mahendra Singh Dhoni extends from Team India to CSK and India Cements, with Dhoni being the vice-president
 champions trophy ke liye 28 may ko england nikalne se pehle ek press conference main jab spot phixing ke bare main dhoni se poocha gaya to ve bilkul patharilii chuppi odhe rahe
 Even now 17 of the total 30 members are in Pasopesh, hence Srinivasan's future is not decided
 satta main chaahe jo bhi rahe, lekin bisisiai ko itnaa bharosa he ki vah paale ke donon taraf maujuud un vajani siyaasi shakhsiyaton ke sangrakshan main bina kisi dikkat ke apana kaarobaar jari rakhega jo vaise to aam taur par pradhanmantri or party adhyakshon se istipha maangate phirte hai, lekin tantra ke bheetar khud itane gahare dhanse hue hai ki badlaav kii pahal kabhi nahin kar sakate

 The Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill, which makes triple talaq illegal, will be introduced in the Lok Sabha today for the fourth time
 bill pesh hone se pehle samaajawaadee party ke saansad asti hasan iske virodh main utar aae hai
 Speaking specifically to 'aaj Tak', ST Hasan, MP from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, said that i oppose the triple divorce bill
 sapa saansad asti hasan ne kaha ki is bill ko laakar sarkaar vyavastha bigaadna chaahati he
 The President should not raise the issue of triple talaq in his address

 At the same time, SP MP from Rampur Azam Khan also said that we will obey what the Quran says

 Sehwag after watching Rohit Sharma's performancerohit Sharma took the slogan "MAKE IN INDIA" very seriously :v <don> Rajnath Singh was made the bjp's Nath
 vaajapeyi or adwani ke saath do baar adhyaksh pad sanbhaalane vaale netaaon kii fehrist main shaamil ho gaye
 But in the circumstances of the party, this thorny crown is visible at the moment
 mishan 2014 main jute rajnath ke saamne 14 chunautiyaan hai, jisase paar paae bagaiyr karishma kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 The question is whether Rajnath Singh will be able to overcome the bjp's Naiya trapped in the state of politics? Senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani made it clear how many challenges Rajnath would face
 1
 BJP will form government after 2014 elections? Rajnath's biggest challenge is to complete the unfinished mission of 2009 in 2014
 rajnath singh ke liye chunautiyon kii fehrist to bahut lambii he lekin unhen sabase pehle chunavi morche par imtihaan dena hoga
 Now the question is whether Rajnath Singh will be able to do this
 2
 How will you find out Rahul Gandhi's youth strategy? Will the BJP led by Rajnath Singh find a break in Rahul's youth strategy in Congress? 3
 bijepi main piem ke kitne daavedaar?ek anaar sau biimaar kii tarj main bijepi main pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari ko lekar maaramaari ko khatm karaane main kaamyaab honge rajnath?4
 Will Rajnath Singh be able to make Narendra Modi? After becoming the President, Rajnath Singh removed Narendra Modi from the BJP Parliamentary Board
 gujarat main hetric lagane ke baad modi kaa kad jis tareeke se badha he or modi jis tarah se purana hisaab kitaab baraabar karne main maahir hai, usamen kya rajnath modi ke saath santulan bana kar chalane main kaamyaab honge?5
 Will BJP be able to maintain balance in the Sangh? Under pressure from top BJP leaders, the Sangh overtook its favorite pawn Nitin Gadkari in the game of check and match, but in the changing circumstances, taking the Sangh and BJP together is also big for Rajnath Will be a challenge
 6
 Will be able to bring modi-nitish together? It will be a challenge to take Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar together
 7
 BJP will have alliance with old alliance partners? If BJP wants to form government in 2014, then Rajnath will have to show talent to bring old allies together
 8
 Will Rajnath revive UP BJP? The challenge is to make his home state Uttar Pradesh again a BJP stronghold
 9
 The challenge of saving the bjp's stronghold in the assembly elections, he will also have to show the ability to make the fort of the BJP invincible in the Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh assembly elections this year, and his stature will be judged on his return to power in Rajasthan and Delhi
 10
 The challenge of keeping the BJP united? It will also be high on Rajnath's agenda to stop the split in the BJP by ending the confrontation of Aham among the big leaders of the BJP, who always prefer the move, character and face
 11
 How will Rajnath handle the drama of Karnataka? The way Karnataka drama started after becoming president, it will be a challenge to deal with it
 12
 How will the bjp's credibility be saved on corruption? The BJP will have to take a tough stance on the corruption of the party leaders, so that the credibility of the BJP can be saved
 13
 Returning to BJP in the role of active opposition, the most important is to eliminate the question about bjp's failure in the role of active opposition
 jis tarah se bijepi kii jagah arvind kejariwal kii nai naveli party tamaam muddon par sarkaar ko gherne main aage raheen hai, us tevar ko phir se hasil karne kii dam dikhaanaa hoga

 Kasab was caught alive during the terror attacks on Mumbai two years ago and was tried in a lower court
 lok abhiyojak pandurang pole ne kaha ki isi maamle main fahim ansaari or sabauddin shaikh ko bari karne ke aadesh ke khilaaf rajya sarkaar ek hafte ke bheetar ek apil daayar karegi 
 Subsequently, Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice Vijaya Tahilramani adjourned the hearing of the case
 nichali adaalat ne ansaari or shaikh ko mumbai main aatankwaadi hamale karne kii sajeesh rachane ke aarope se bari kar diya tha
 The court argued that the evidence available against both is questionable
 suraksha kaarnon se kasaab ko aaj ucch nyaayalay ke samaksh pesh nahin kiya gaya
 He had earlier written letters in view of which the State Legal Services Authority appointed Amin Solkar and Farhana Shah to defend Kasab at the state's expense
 solkar aaj adaalat ke samaksh upasthit nahin the jabaki shah ne kasaab kii taraf se apil daayar karne ke liye do maheene kaa vakt maanga
 However, the judges said they would hear Solkar and the state's side before passing the order on 12 August
 nichali adaalat ne pehle hi kasaab ko maut kii sajaa sunaane vaala apana faisla pushti ke liye ucch nyaayalay ke paas bhej diya he
 On November 26, 2008, Kasab and nine other Pakistani terrorists killed 166 people in attacks in various places in Mumbai

 At the same time, he will also plead on the appeal filed against the acquittal of Ansari and Ahmed by the lower court
 haalanki, nikam adaalat main aaj maujuud nahin the or rajya kaa pratinidhitiv lok abhiyojak pandurang pole ne kiya
 Apart from the confirmation of Kasab's death sentence, the appeal filed by Kasab and the state is expected to be heard simultaneously with the High Court
 gat chah may ko apana faisla sunaate vakt nichali adaalat ne kaha tha ki kasaab ne jaghanya aparaadh kiya or use jail kii sajaa kaatane ke liye bhejne kii bajaay faansee di jaani chahie taaki jail main band aatankwaadiyon kii rihaai ke badale main qandahar vimaan apharan cond jais ghatnaon kii punrariti ko roka ja sake

 Rawat told NDTV India that he is 'convincing' of many independents and would like to take him along if he gets an absolute majority
 voting se thik ek din pehle harish ravat patrakaron ke aage apni jeet or exit pole ke nateezon kii haar kii bhavishyavaanee karte hai
 He said 'plan b will not be required
 ’ lekin exit pole ke nattejey congress ke liye niraashajanak hai or har rajaneta kii tarah harish ravat bhi uttarakhand main exit pole ke nattejey maanane ko taiyaar nahin
 Rawat is also indicating that he has spoken to independents and if any party does not get majority, Congress will try to form government with help from outside
 “hamako aavashyaktaa ho yaa na ho
 
 
 i am saying that i am sure that i will cross the figure of 36, but even then if there is a right man, and he is winning by fighting independents, then i would like to take him along

 ” The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly has always had a history of close contests in 2012 when the Congress won 32 seats and the BJP 31 seats

 In such a situation, both parties know what is the importance of small parties and independents
 haalanki exit pole nateezon ke baad bijepi netaa kah rahe hai unki party ko prachand bahumat milegaa
 BJP spokesperson and BJP candidate from Vikasnagar seat Munna Singh Chauhan says, “given the Modi wave and the way our party has exposed Congress misrule and corruption, we will get more than 50 seats
 ” On the other hand, Harish Rawat, in a conversation with NDTV India, admitted that he was wrong in giving tickets to some seats
 “main maanata hum ki kuch siton main ham or majboot ummidavaar utaar sakate the
 Rawat refers to seats like Tehri and Jwalapur
 jahaan unke mutabik party ke liye ‘dikkat’ ho sakati he, lekin ravat ne isaki bharpai ke liye nirdaliyon ke saath sampark shuru kar diya he
 “to run the state, we have to form a large social coalition who are like minded people, be it from the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal or independents or anyone else
 unako ham rope in karenge
 i have also told the party that in today's situation we cannot think as conservative
 ” However, after the exit poll results, BJP leaders are saying that their party will get a strong majority
 bijepi ke pravaktaa or vikasnagar seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar munna singh chouhan kehete hai, “modi lahar ko dekhte hue or hamaari party ne jis tarah congress ke kushasan or bhrashtachar ko benakaab kiya he use dekhte hue hamen 50 se adhik siten milengi
 " udhar harish ravat ne enditivi india se baatcheet main mana ki kuch siton par tikat dene main unase gadabadi hui he
 “I believe that in some seats we could field more strong candidates
 ” ravat kaa ishaara tehri or jwalapur jaisi siton ko lekar he
 While according to him there may be 'problems' for the party, but Rawat has started contact with independents to make up for it
 “rajya chalaane ke liye hamen ek vrihad saamaajik gathbandhan karnaa hoga jo like minded log hai wo chaahe uttarakhand kranti dal se hon yaa nirdaleey hon yaa koi or ho unka saath liya janaa chahie

 The Bharatiya Janata Party is not in the mood to take any kind of laxity regarding the Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) election
 vah dilli or bihar vidhansabha jaisi galati doharaana nahin chaahati, yahi vajah he ki party ne is baar nayaa prayog karte hue apane sabhi maujuuda parshadon ko tikat nahin diya he, lekin bhojpuri film star manoj tiwari kaa yah nayaa daanv party par ulta padane laga he
 State BJP president Manoj Tiwari has told the reason for his decision to give preference to the youth, but due to the non-availability of tickets to the current councilors, the voices of protest have started to rise, even if they are in a compressed tongue! On the other hand, there is also a contradiction in the party's decision
 party ne 60 se adhik umr ke logon ko tikat dekar khud virodhiyon ko bolne kaa mauka bhi de diya he
 The BJP, which has made the MCD election a question on its nose, was talking about giving new faces a chance from the beginning and waging war against nepotism, but the list of BJP candidates is telling a different story
 party ne pradesh ke teen upaadhyakshon or ek upaadhyaksh kii patni sahit teen jiladhyakshon or do jiladhyakshon kii patni ko tikat diya he
 These include BJP Mahila Morcha president Poonam Parashar Jha and Purvanchal Morcha state president Vipin Bahari
 vahiin, bhaajapa kii maujuuda parshad hir bano ismail kii beti rubina ko kurash nagar se tikat diya gaya he to pashchimi-uttari dilli se saansad udit raaj ke bhattije vijay ko mongolpuri bi-ward se tikat diya gaya he
 Raj Kumar Ballan, who is close to Manoj Tiwari, has been given ticket from Brahmapuri in East Delhi, while Jai Prakash JP, who is close to Union Minister Vijay Goel, has been given ticket from Sadar Bazar
 kul milakar, dekha jaae to party ne maujuuda parshadon ko tikat nahin diya, lekin dabang parshadon kii baghawat ke dar se unke sage-sambandhiyon ko tikat dekar chunaav main khadaa kar diya
 Although the councilors are not happy with the new party stakes, they are seen standing with the party, playing discipline
 shalimaar ke ward number 56 se upachunaav jitkar maatr nau maheene pehle hi parshad bane bhupender mohan bhandari ne bataaya, "mujhe parshad bane hue sirf nau maheene hi hue hai
 i had to do a lot of work for the public, but now the post will not be there
 phir bhi main party ke faisle se puri tarah se sahamat hum
 The party must have taken this decision only after some deliberation
 " At the same time, Councilor Sandhya Verma from ward number 12E of East Delhi said, "the party should have given tickets to at least those councilors who have done a good job
 kaatna hi tha to un parshadon kaa tikat kaata janaa chahie tha, jinka ricard kharaab rahaa he
 Well, whatever, we stand with the party's decision
 " Councilor Madhav Prasad from Sangam Vihar ward number 76 says, "the party's decision is paramount
 party ne mujhe 2007 or phir 2012 main tikat diya tha
 If the party did not give the ticket this time, it would not have given it thoughtfully
 party ne aise kai kaaryakarta hai jo pichley kai dashakon se party ke liye kaam kar rahe hai, lekin unhen aaj tak mauka nahin mila
 i believe that everyone should get a chance, if the party wants to give a chance to the youth, its decision is welcome
 " There are many councilors present who do not seem to agree with the party's decision and they took a different route
 govindpuri se parshad chander prakaash ne bhaajapa kii ore se suchi jari kiye jane se pehle hi congress kaa 'haath' tham liya, jabaki navada se parshad krishna gahalot ne bataur nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 a sitting woman councilor from East Delhi has also filed nomination to contest as an independent
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki bhaajapa ne namakan daakhil karne kii aakhri samay-seemaa se kuch hi ghante pehle apni aakhri suchi jari kii
 The opposition is calling it a 'thought-out strategy'
 congress kii dilli ikai ke ek kaaryakarta ne kaha, "bhaajapa ne aakhir namakan se kuch hi ghante pehle apni aakhri suchi jari kyon kii? iskaa saaf matlab he ki vah nahin chaahati ki unke parshadon ko sochane kaa kuch or samay na mili
 "he said that the BJP was beating up the preference for the youth in the elections, but it has given tickets to many people over the age of 60, with candidates like Kiran Vaidya from Mayur Vihar and Kailash Sankla from Punjabi Bagh
 tippaniyan Actually, the 'gujarat model' dominates the BJP
 party ne maujuuda parshadon kaa tikat kaatane kaa prayog gujarat main bhi kiya tha, jo khaasaa safal bhi rahaa tha
 Voting is going to be held on 23 April and when the results are announced on 26 April, only then will you know how successful bjp's new bet was
 gauratlab he ki saal 2012 main emsidi ko teen hisson- uttari dilli nagar nigam, purvi dilli nagar nigam or dakshini dilli nagar nigam main baant diya gaya tha
 The 272-member MCD has a total of 104 wards in North Delhi, 64 in East Delhi and 104 wards in South Delhi
 teenon nagar nigamon par bhaajapa kabiz he, uske saamne vaapasi karne kii chunauti he
 He is pitted against the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi and the Congress which has ruled Delhi for 15 years
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) emsidi chunaav ko apni naak kaa sawaal bana chuki bhaajapa shuru se hi nae chehron ko mauka dene or bhai-bhatijawad ke khilaaf jang chhedane kii baat kah rahi thi, lekin bhaajapa ummidavaaron kii suchi alag hi kahani bayaan kar rahi he
 The party has given tickets to three district heads and two district heads, including three vice presidents and a vice president's wife
 inamen bhaajapa mahila morcha kii adhyaksh punam parashar jha or purvachal morcha ke pradesh adhyaksh vipin bahaari shaamil hai
 At the same time, Rubina, daughter of bjp's current councilor Heer Bano Ismail, has been given ticket from Quraish Nagar while Vijay, nephew of MP Udit Raj from west-north Delhi, has been given ticket from Mangolpuri B-ward
 manoj tiwari ke kareebi raaj kumaar ballaan ko purvi dilli ke brahampuri se tikat diya gaya he, jabaki kendriya mantri vijay goyal ke kareebi jai prakaash jepi ko sadar bazaar se tikat diya gaya he
 Overall, the party did not give tickets to the sitting councilors, but fearing rebellious councilors rebelled and gave tickets to their relatives and put them in the election
 party ke nae daanv se maujuud parshad haalanki khush nahin hai, phir bhi anushaasan nibhaate hue ve party ke saath khadey hote dikhaai de rahe hai
 Bhupendra Mohan Bhandari, who became a councilor just nine months before winning the by-election from Shalimar's ward number 56, said, “it has been only nine months since i became a councilor
 mujhe janata ke liye kaaphi kaam karnaa tha, lekin ab pad nahin rahegaa
 Nevertheless i completely agree with the party's decision
 party ne kuch soch-samajhakar hi yah faisla liya hoga
 " vahiin, purvi dilli ke ward number 12i se parshad sandhya verma ne kaha, "party ko kam se kam un parshadon ko to tikat dena hi chahie tha, jinhone acha kaam kiya he
 Had to be cut, then the ticket of those councilors, whose record has been poor
 khayr, jo bhi ho, ham party ke faisle ke saath khadey hai
 " sangam vihaar ward number 76 se parshad madhav prasad kehete hai, "party kaa faisla sarvopari he
 The party gave me a ticket in 2007 and again in 2012
 party ne is baar tikat nahin diya to kuch soch-samajhakar hi nahin diya hoga
 The party has many activists who have been working for the party for the past several decades, but they have not got a chance till date
 main maanata hum ki sabko mauka milanaa chahie, party yuvaaon ko mauka dena chaahati he to uske faisle kaa swaagat he
 " kai maujuud parshad aise bhi hai, jo party ke faisle se sahamat nahin dikhe or unhone alag raah pakad lee
 Councilor Chander Prakash from Govindpuri held the Congress 'hand' even before the list was released by the BJP, while Councilor Krishna Gehlot from Nawada has decided to contest as an independent
 purvi dilli kii ek maujuuda mahila parshad ne bhi bataur nirdaleey chunaav ladane ke liye namakan daakhil kiya he
 Perhaps this is why the BJP released its final list just hours before the deadline for filing nominations
 vipaksh ise 'sochi-samajhi ranneeti' kah rahaa he
 An activist of the Congress's Delhi unit said, "why did the BJP release its final list just hours before the nomination? It clearly means that she does not want her councilors to have no more time to think
 " unhone kaha ki bhaajapa chunaav main yuvaaon ko tarjeeh dene kaa dhindhora peet rahi thi, lekin usne 60 saal se adhik umr ke kai logon ko tikat diya he, jisamen mayur vihaar se ummidavaar kiran vaidya or punjabi baag se kailash saankala jaise ummidavaar hai
