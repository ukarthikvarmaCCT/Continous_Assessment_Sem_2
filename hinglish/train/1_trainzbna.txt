 upi police dwaara 27 oktober ko sipaahi ke 41,610 padon ke liye hone vaali ab tak kii sabase badi pariksha sthagit kar di gai he
 The 'uttar Pradesh Recruitment and Promotion Board' has taken this decision due to the accident of the vehicle carrying the question papers
 board ke pariksha niyantrak ke mutabik pariksha patron ko lakhanu se sambandhit kendron par bheja ja rahaa tha, inamen se ek gaadi kaa accident ho gaya
 This opened the seal of the envelopes of question papers kept in the car
 isliye prashnpatron ke li hone kii ashanka or pariksha kii shuchita banaae rakhane ke liye pariksha sthagit karne kaa nirnay liya gaya he
 However, preparations were going on for the last three months on a war footing for the examination to be held on 27 October
 iske liye record 20,78,000 logon ko prashnptr jari kiye gaye the
 Board secretary Amitabh Yash says that this exam can be conducted in the second week of December
 pariksha niyantrak ne sabhi parikshaarthiyon se apana pravesh patr sambhaal kar rakhane kii apil kii he
 Although the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board is giving the reason for the postponement of the train to the accident of the vehicle, but the SSC examination on October 27 is also being considered as the reason behind this decision
 board ke ek adhikari bataate hai pichley do maheene se vibhaag ko vaise abhyarthiyon ke prarthanapatr mil rahe hai jinhone police bhartee or esayssi kii pariksha main shaamil hone ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Both the exams were also expected due to an uproar
 police bhartee pariksha sthagit karne ke nirnay kaa virodh bhi shuru ho gaya he
 BJP spokesperson Chandramohan says that the examination board has made it clear that the examination arrangements were not well maintained and perhaps the board is not able to get such a big exam due to the possibility of leaking the question paper due to the accident

 The 2019 Lok Sabha election is surrounded by accusations
 jamini str se lekar soshal media tak, chunavi kushti main is baar netaa khub damakham ke saath nazar ladate aa rahe hai
 However, the most important battle among all this is that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-vs Rahul Gandhi
 modi or rahul gandhi ne soshal media par ek duusare ko pachhaadne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 To measure all this, the India Today Data Intelligence Unit tried to find out from the Twitter data who is heavy in the battle of social media
 10 march 2019 yani jabase chunaavon ke tarikhon kaa elaan hua tab se lekar 21 april 2019 tak hamane rahul gandhi or narendra modi ke twitor aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya gaya
 Since Modi as Prime Minister also keeps tweeting a lot, we kept all his official tweets out of our analysis and only counted political tweets
 twits kii sankhyatwitor par jab kuch post karne kii baari aati he to narendra modi kii tulana main rahul gandhi kamjor nazar aate hai
 In these 42 days till now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has posted 489 tweets
 vahiin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne isi dauraan sirf 72 twit kiye hai
 If we calculate the average, where Modi tweets about eleven times a day, Rahul Gandhi is unable to reach even the average of 2 tweets per day
 ritvit ke maamle main bhi modi rahul se kaaphi aage hai
 While Modi received nearly 36 lakh retweets on 489 tweets, Rahul Gandhi's 72 tweets, 6
 7 lakh baar hi ritvit ho paae
 Activation on twittervideo Since the character limit on Twitter is 280, therefore users are not able to express themselves freely
 photo or video is kami ko puraa karne kaa kaam karte hai
 In this case too, Rahul Gandhi is left behind
 modi ne apane 489 twits main se 176 twits ( 36 pratishat) to video ke saath hi post kii thim
 Out of the 72 tweets of Rahul Gandhi, only 11 tweets (15 per cent) were posted along with the video
 modi ke twits main video kii sankhya isliye bhi zyaada he kyonki wo ek hi chiz ko doharaa-doharaa ke twit karte hai
 Whenever Modi reaches somewhere to deliver an election speech, his Twitter broadcasts his speech live
 iske alaava modi usee bhaashan se 2-3 clip kaat karke phir se twit karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi, on the other hand, rarely goes live on Twitter and most of his videos are edited and posted later
 bhashaa kii batdonon netaaon ne kshetreey bhashaaon ko dhyaan main rakhaa he, lekin yahaan bhi modi ne rahul gandhi ko patkhni de di
 Modi did tweet in more languages, but his number was less, according to the same figures, Rahul Gandhi made more tweets in different languages
 jahaan rahul gandhi ne 6 bhashaaon main twit kiya, vahiin modi ne 9 bhashaaon main twit kiya
 Of Rahul Gandhi's 72 tweets, 71 per cent were in English, 24 per cent in Hindi and a few above 1 per cent in Tamil, Odia, Malayalam and Marathi
 modi ne apni zyaadaatar twits ko angreji bhashaa tak simit rakhaa
 He tweeted more than Rahul Gandhi in regional languages, but when he was judged in percentage, his number was less
 modi kii 489 twits main se 83 pratishat angreji main thi, 13 pratishat hindi main, telegu or marathi main 1 pratishat se thodaa adhik or oriya, gujarati, bangla, tamil or asamiya bhashaa main 1 pratishat se kam twits dekhne ko mili
 Connection with people is one area where the difference between Akash Himal and Modi and Rahul Gandhi is seen
 rahul gandhi kaa twitor sirf unki baaten hi rakhata he iske vipareet modi ke twits logon se judate hue nazar aate hai
 Modi also contacts more people on Twitter
 apane saathi mantriyon ke vichaaron ko twit karne se lekar, logon ko jaagruk voter banane ke liye modi top filmstaron, kalakaaron or patrakaron ko tag karke twit bhi karte hai
 When # mainbhichowkidaar was trending on Twitter, Modi was seen thanking the general public on Twitter
 congress ne bhi # chowkidaarhichorhai trend karne kii koshish kii lekin rahul ke twitor handle main modi vaala dam nahin dikhaa
 He rarely tweeted anything quoting a fellow Congressman and did not even retweet the tweets of his sister Priyanka Gandhi
 aam janata ke saath rahul gandhi twitor par to bilkul bhi interact karte nazar nahin aate
 On 11 March this year, Narendra Modi congratulated Punjab Chief Minister and senior Congress Party leader Captain Amarinder Singh on his birthday, while the Congress President did not congratulate him on Twitter
 haalanki, rahul gandhi bhi twitor par khaase lokapriy hai lekin in sab tathyon ke aadhaar par ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki soshal media par pradhanmantri narendra modi jitna asar chhodane ke liye rahul gandhi ko abhi ek lambii duuri tay kerani he

 After all, who is guilty of sealing and what is the solution
 ye sawaal har koi puch rahaa he or kya ceiling ko lekar didie ke prastaav main abhi or bhi pench hai
 Where everyone is struggling with these questions, tell you where is the screw, what is the solution and who is guilty
 darasal ye baat 2006 se shuru hoti he, jab ceiling ko lekar dilli main ubaal tha
 After which around 2300 roads were given relief by notifying
 uske baad dilli ke master plan 2021 lagu kar diya, jisamen vyapaariyon ko kanvarjan charge ke saath-saath jin vyapaariyon ne apane dukaan kii sies 300 squaire meter tak badha diya tha, unako bhi is master plan main raahat di gai thi
 What is the matter at which time this master plan was implemented, at that time, about 1 lakh 6 xxrep 4 0 traders got registered and gave conversion charge on it
 saath hi master plan ke mutabik har saal kii 30 june taarikh charge dene kii antim tithi di gai
 Provision for fine 10 times was given for not giving
 jinhone bhi niyamon kaa ulanghan kar apni dukaan 120 squaire yaa kuch or meter se badhaakar 300 squaire meter kar diya tha, unako bhi chhot di gai or ye kaha gaya ki jinhone bana lee unako raahat he, lekin ab aage se koi or na bane
 At the same time, MCD was asked to arrange for parking by charging a parking fee
 basament main profeshnal offis (matlab doctor, sie yaa phir vakil) banane kii chhot di gai thi
 What happened and who got relief from convicting Some businessmen gave conversion charge and some did not
 2008 main ye sankhya ghatakar 36000 ke kareeb pahunch gai or saal dar saal kanvarjan charge dene vaale vyapaariyon kii sankhya ghatati chali gai
 Most merchants forgot to pay the conversion charge and defaulted
 vahiin kuch vyapaariyon ne na to kanvarjan charge diya or duusari taraf apni dukaan 120 squaire meter yaa kuch or meter se badhaakar 300 squaire meter kar diya
 This means that neither the merchants gave conversion charge, which was required to be given, while some traders violated the rules and increased the size of their shop
 emsidi ne regularali na to kanvarjan charge vasula or na hi isko lekar koi sakhti dikhaai 
 Also forgot to arrange parking
 is dauraan kai vyapaariyon ne apni dukaan bech di to kisi ne koi or dukaan kharidi
 That is, the one who sold the shop or who bought the shop, neither of them paid the conversion charge
 iskaa nuksaan ye hua ki jisane bhi dukaan 2014 main kharidi to usko pichhlaa bakaayaa bhi dena padegaa
 MCD also did not provide parking
 matlab vyapaariyon ke saath-saath emsidi bhi iske liye doshi he
 What is the solution? The solution is to make some changes in the master plan, which provides a penalty of 10 times for non-conversion charges, the penalty should be reduced from 10 times to one or two times, which the DDA made in its proposal is
 vahiin kanvarjan charge dene main vyapaariyon ko raahat di jaae, jiske tahat charge ko 4 yaa 5 kishton main dene ko kaha jaae
 In the category which was created from Area Wise a to e in the master plan, shops falling in the a category have to pay a conversion charge of Rs 6000 per square meter a year
 matlab agar kisi vyapaaree kii dukaan 120 squaire meter main he to usase ek saal kaa 6000*120= itnaa paisa dena hota he
 Those in the e category have to pay 1500 square meters, but there is confusion about the category
 jiske mutabik khan market or subhash nagar kii dukaan ek nahin ho sakati
 Which needs to be cleared again
 sirf in donon main badlaav kar diya jaae to kareeb aadhi se adhik vyapaariyon kii samasya vahiin khatm ho jaaegi
 Where is Pench Jahan Delhi is struggling with parking problem, now there is talk of giving relief to those traders who violated the rules and increased the size of their shops
 matlab jinka 40 squaire meter main tha unhone 100 squaire meter kar di to kisi ne 100 se badhaakar 200 kar di to kisi ne 200 se badhaakar 250 kar di
 That is, the traders who got relief in violation of the rules in 2007, now the same problem is there again
 yani 10 saal baad phir niyamon main ullaghann karne vaale vyapaariyon ko chhot dene kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he, jisame didie ne FAR main badhotaree kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin phir vahi parking
 Meaning shoppers who have increased the size of the shops will have to provide parking in the ground floor after increasing the FAR
 samasya yaheen se shuru hoti he kyonki jinako nayaa bananaa he wo to bana sakate hai, lekin jinaki dukaan pehle se bani he kya wo dukaan todakar ground floor main parking banaaenge jo ki badi samasya he or yahi he sabase bada pench
 The second is that if traders who violate the rules are given relief for the second time, then what is the guarantee that no one else will increase the size of their shop
 yani jin vyapaariyon ne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 2007 main chhot pai thi, ab das saal baad phir sarkaar vahi chhot dene kii taiyaari main he
 In such a situation, there is a question whether this matter will stop, for which the government, MCD and businessmen will have to come out with concrete results, because it is not wrong to say that the businessmen and MCD officials together broke the rules
 ya aaj agar iskaa samaadhaan nahin kiya gaya to phir ho saktaa he ki 10 saal baad phir vahi sthiti hogi
 Where it is today, it will be the same and then the Supreme Court will have to intervene in it and the governments will have to tell whether the government wants to make Delhi a slum in the name of exemption

 eden garden stadium main khele gaye mukaable main kolkata niterides team ne royal chalangers bangalore team ko 47 ranon se parajeet kar diya
 Chasing a target of 191 runs set by the Knight Riders, the Royal Challengers Bangalore team could only manage 143 runs at the loss of six wickets in the stipulated 20 overs
 chalangers kii ore se kris gail ne sabase adhik 86 ran banaae
 He was dismissed in the last over and returned to the pavilion
 gail jis andaaj ke liye jane jate hai, vah unki shuruaati ballebaaji main nahin dikhaa
 In fact, his team had lost three wickets in just 34 overs
 iske baad vah dabaav main dikhe lekin iske baavjood unhone 42 gendon par apana ardhashatak puraa kiya
 At the other end he did not get any batsman's support
 pari ke tisare over main yusuf pathan kii aakhri gend par sunil narayan ne gail kaa aasaan sa kaich bhi tapakaaya tha
 Gayle was just 12 at that time
 aisi paristhiti main bhi gail ne 58 gendon par saat chauke or chah chakke lagaae or out hone se pehle 86 ran bana daale
 After hitting a half-century off 42 balls, he looked even more dangerous and in his true colors
 lekin tab tak ranon kaa dabaav itnaa haaavee ho gaya tha, chijen vash se baahar nikal chuki thi
 For the remaining 36 runs of his 86-run innings, he hit just 16 balls
 unke alaava chalangers kaa koi bhi ballebaaj maidan par na to tik sakaa or na hi koi khaas ran bana sakaa
 After Gayle, Sourav Tiwary scored the most runs
 tiwari ne 22 gendon kaa saamana karte hue ek chauke or ek chakke kii madad se 19 ran banaae
 Apart from these two, only Virat Kohli and Mayank Agarwal could reach double digits
 kohli 18 ran banaakar out hue to agarwal 10 ran banaakar pavilion laute
 Challengers had their first setback as Tillakaratne Dilshan

 apni barkhaastagi par naresh ne talkh tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki hamen nikaalane kaa adhikaar netaa ji ke paas nahin he
 Naresh Agrawal is considered an expert in recognizing the call of power 
 kaha jaataa he ki chunaav purv jis ore naresh agarwal hote hai jeet usee kii hoti he
 This time too, rumors of Naresh Aggarwal's change of face have cropped up many times but the truth is that he is currently in SP and raising the flag of Akhilesh
 naresh uttamanaresh uttam samaajawaadee party ke ek eemaandaar netaa hai
 Naresh Uttam was also one of the founding leaders of the Samajwadi Party

 Recently he came into the news when Akhilesh handed him the party reins in Uttar Pradesh
 sapa netaa naresh uttam ne apni tajposhi ke vakt hi kaha tha ki ve akhilesh ke saath milakar kisaanon or pradesh ke vikaas ke liye kaam karenge
 Abhishek Mishra In the cabinet of Akhilesh, Abhishek Mishra is also very reliable

 Pongapanthi very much

 Now it can be called Khabat

 Let's have a look
 nayika peshey se britain kii ek film diarector he
 Malaysia has come to shoot
 philhal ek cafe main baithi he
 That is today's woman
 aarthik rup se swaavlambee
 Since i have seen the film, i also tell that the heroine is also self-respecting
 magar phir use ishk sa kuch ho jaataa he
 And then all the energy within it flows away
 ladki kaa israar kya he
 Hey Piya, bring me golden earrings
 unhen main chumkar kaan main pahan luun
 Hey Piya, get me shopping
 pyaar muhabbat vaali film dikhaao
 And why do you do all this
 kyonki ji meri kalaaiyaan gori hai
 Not even white or aage badhkar agali line main kalaayiyon ke white hone kii duhai di jaati he
 And then the killer is dropped
 tere hisse aaiyaan ve
 We feel that the heroine wearing hot pants will be a strong woman in every sense
 lekin yah bhram buree tarah tuutata he jab vah kahati he, 'requestaan paaiyaan ve
 'he is dependent on the man for shopping and is in desperate mode for this
 stri kii purush par nirbharta kaa yah uttar-aadhunik rup hi to he
 That is, o man
 ye sampurna charachar jisaki kaamana karata he
 He is part of your destiny
 par uske liye tuje nayika ko kharidari karwaani hogi
 The protagonist also spews his soft lips while rapping
 vah apni kuntha kaamana ko yun prakat karata he
 White Kaliyan Drives Me Crazy
 or phir kuch kuch lantaraani
 The heroine now goes even further
 use sirf shopping or film kii hi tamanna nahin he
 Now she needs pink sardine too
 or colorphul chuudi bhi
 Why should uski marji
 Personally, i wouldn't mind tying girls to pink only
 ho saktaa he ki gulabi rangath ke kuch aitihaasik kaaran rahe hon
 But they are no longer investigated
 ye maan liya jaataa he bai difolt ki ladki he to use pink hi pasand aayega
 Or say it will be done
 kabhi kisi bachche ke liye frock kharidne jaaie
 Not a girl out of the mouth and the salesman Mar Pink Pink will cook you
 par thik he, yahaan nayika kii marji he
 To get him a pink sardine
 mujhe rang par nahin maangane par aapatti he
 Read the heroine
 naukari kare
 Shop fiercely with your money
 gaae
 i took pink sardine
 colorphul chuudi le lee
 Did a lot of shopping
 or phir kahe
 a boy

 That means in two and a half decades, we have come so far not in thinking, understanding and ground matters
 bharpoor mehnat ke saath
 As soon as the chitis hear the art, it is white
 film aaj kaa arjuna kaa gaanaa
 Here too, the heroine is wooing the hero in the village setup
 kah rahi he ki gori he kalaaiyaan, tu laa de mujhe hari hari chudiyaan
 i can make you my child aap kah sakate hai ki nabbe kaa manamohani samaa tab nahin bandhaa tha
 The heroine used to take food to the farm
 ghar sambhalati thi
 But he used to go to die selling crops
 uske hisse bachche, kapade late or jevar aate the
 No cache to uskaa kahana banataa tha ki mujhe chudiyaan laa do
 And then the hero did not even have such gift options to see that i love you so much
 puure do jibi kaa natpac dalava diya tere phone main
 It is not about Bangles
 yahaan nayak kuch thos baat karata he
 First of all, denying the greatness of whiteness, it is said that you are white
 chaahe kaali ho kalai
 Whoever gets caught wearing the bangle
 matlab nayak kuch pragatisheel he
 Does not get stuck on the color of Khaleria
 shaayad tab tak gaanv main fere and lavali ko bazaar najar nahin aayaa tha
 Or, the wholesale price did not descend into this new paradise on the slips of the Prime Minister's Gram Sadak Yojana to make a dent in the market of Pond Colgate and Lifebuoy who came out of MBA
 par aage nayak nalayak funs jaae kii baat kyon karata he
 What does that mean ji ki aadmi aurat ke husn main funs jaataa he
 As if not stranded, you should climb on Mars with a kamandal in one breath
 par thahrie, vimarsh iske baad he
 After the bangles in the song, the protagonist talks about the real issue of Earth
 vah kahata he ki hari hari chudiyon kii dekhe hariyaali, bhima kii na kheti suukh jaae
 So that means the purchase of the first farm, tab ye sab raita failaayaa jaae
 Now is the new age
 nayika kyon chuudi ke liye nayak se israar kare
 Most of the heroes have left the farm anyway
 ab ve jeth ke maheene main genhu kii kataai kii chintaa main pasinaa nahin bahaate
 Slavery in front of a computer in such rooms
 phir brake ke dauraan usee genhu ke bane rifined avatar se bane burgers khaakar bas ek minute ke liye baahar nikalate hai
 From that cold vacuum
 or kehete hai
 It's so hot nayika mardon kii cheri nahin rah gai he
 She has put on Ghaghra Utsar hot pants
 uski marji
 Who wore clothes
 magar yun nayak se chijju maangana akhar gaya kasam se
 This lophadi and seduction work was done by Salman of the nineties
 jab vah gaata tha
 Does it go from nine to twelve? vah sajjanta kaa swang nahin karata
 It makes it clear that the show is night, the tickets are two, and i will sit back
 ise kavita ko gadhy main badalte dekhte hai ham film gangs of vasepur main
 The hero has become a don
 magar dekhne main chimrakhi hi he
 The heroine is the town version of Madhuri
 baro maang meri baro dekhakar kasmasaati
 Nayak remains a guided heat sensing missile like ninety percent of men
 clivej dekhne ko aatur vyakul
 And then the heroine asks while romancing the bookstore
 karan arjuna dekhne jane se pehle
 Will sit around, find popcorn on your lap
 nayak bechaara hadakaai ke dar se na na kahata he
 And then the heroine says that when not to do all this then don't go looking with your mother
 khayr
 i knew the hero was changing the heroine
 gaanon ne bhi der saver isaki saakhi de hi di
 Please remember lakshya film kaa vah seen
 The protagonist simply states that we are together and we should be together
 nayika gussa jaati he
 Hey, how did it hit the mouth with a straight face
 adaa se kaho
 And on hearing this, the hero Chibilla starts to wobble
 agar main kahuun mujhe tumse muhabbat he
 The heroine explains to this naïve Bhandari that it would have been better to have said this in a more punishing manner
 
 
 magar dashak bitate na bitate nayika ko ye dhang bor karne lagata he
 Now he needs a straight-talking boy
 ye tu phool main bhanvara tip rupakon kii dukaan kaa stall nahin sajavaana use
 So when the protagonist turns around and admires Ishq while bowing to the subjugated ancestors of the previous lesson, the heroine scolds
 sidhe point par aane kaa farmaan sunaati he
 i swear, i remember that line of Shamsher Bahadur's poem 'broken Shattered' at that time
 uske injection kii chikotiyon main bada prem he
 Virat Kohli's aggression on the field is a topic of discussion in the cricket world but India's vice-captain is working hard to change his attitude following the advice from his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 kohli ne kaha, ‘maine iske bare main emes dhoni se kaaphi baat kii he
 He is a player who does not flow in emotions and does not cross that limit
 vah aisa khilaadi he jo hameshaa dhary se kaam letaa he
 It is important to learn this kind of thing from such an important person
 ’unhone kaha, ‘vah mujhe kahata rahata he ki jab tak main is had ke andar rahoonga tab tak cricketer ke rup main mujhamen sudhaar hota rahegaa
 Asked if the vice captaincy made him more aware, Kohli said, "when i became the vice captain, the people around me told me that i needed to change my aggression
" kyonki log kii ab mujhe par adhik najar he or mujhe apane aakraamak ravaiye main badlaav karnaa hoga
 He said, 'you learn over time
 shuruuaat main main us tarah pratikriya detaa tha jis tarah mujhe nahin deni chahie
 Now when i look back

 Pressure and special occasions made aggression difficult to control

 After registering a case in the Pradyuman murder case, the CBI team went to investigate Ryan International School in Gurgaon
 sibiai kii team main teen adhikari shaamil hai, jo skool main chaanbin kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Pradyuman's father expressed satisfaction over the commencement of the CBI investigation
 is dauraan cese ke teenon aropiyon ko sibiai remand par bheja gaya he
 The court gave the three accused in the Pradyuman murder case on remand for a day on the cbi's appeal
 in teenon aropiyon ko is sansanikhej hatyakand ke silsile main gudgaanv police ne giftaar kiya tha
 Now the CBI team will interrogate these accused
 sibiai jaanch shuru ho jane ke baad pradhyumna ke pita varun thakur ne ajtak / india today se khaas baatcheet karte hue kaha ki ve santusht hai
 Now CBI has started investigation in this matter
 unhen vishwaas he ki is maamle main sibiai maamle kii tah tak jaaegi or sahi report pesh karegi

 Let us tell you that earlier the CBI team reached Gurgaon Police Headquarters on Friday evening and took charge of this case from Haryana Police

 The question of who and why he murdered innocent Pradyumna at Ryan International School remains the same in people's minds

 At the same time, Haryana Police is claiming that it has reached the bottom of the case and the charge sheet is almost ready
 lekin kisi bhi cese ke khulaase kaa matlab sirf yah nahin hota ki police kisi aadmi ko saamne khadaa kar de jo gunaah kabool kar rahaa ho
 Investigation means that all the questions related to that matter have satisfactory answers before the police
 gauratlab he ki beeti 8 sitambar ko gudgaanv ke reyaan international skool main maasoom pradhyumna kii galaa retkar berahami se hatya kar di gai thi
 After this, the Haryana government has taken Ryan International School of Gurgaon under its control for three months

 maharashtra menkisampani tamaam maangon ko lekar somvaar ko rajya vidhansabha kagheravkarenge
 The farmers left Nashik for Mumbai on 7 March under the banner of All India Kisan Sabha
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is march main 30 hajaar se zyada kisaan hissaa le rahe hai
 Why farmers are angry The question is what is the crisis that caused the farmers to take to the streets
 darasal karj kii samasya ke chalate maharashtra main kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii khabaren aati rahati hai
 The farmers involved in the march demanded that the state government did not fulfill the promise of loan waiver last year
 kisaan swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii bhi maang kar rahe hai
 At the same time tribal farmers are also demanding settlement of land allocation related matters
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is march main sabase zyada adivasee kisaan hi hissaa le rahe hai
 In this way, there are many more demands from the farmers' government, from loan waiver to fair support price and ownership of land
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu kiya jaae or garib, majhole kisaanon kaa rin maaf kiya jaae
 Farmers allege that the data on loan waiver is being exaggerated
 keval nunatam samarthan mulya kaaphi nahinkisanon kii maang he ki unhen swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon ke mutabik kheti main hone vaale kharche ke saath uskaa 50 fisadi or daam samarthan mulya ke rup main diya janaa chahie
 Reasonable support price should be found
 keval nunatam samarthan mulya de dena kaaphi nahin
 In this march, tribal are participating in number of thousands
 asal main, isamen sabase adhik sankhya main adivasee hi shaamil hai
 Tribal farmers say that at times forest officials dig their fields
 ve jab chahen tab aisa kar sakate hai
 The tribals want rights over their land
 maharashtra ke kai hisson main kisaan kitnashkon ke prayog se bhi trast he
 Instead of providing relief, they are damaging their crops
 kya hai swaminathan ayog kii siforishendesh ke kisi bhi hisse main kisaanon ke virodh pradarshan ke saath swaminathan ayog kii charchaa bhi shuru ho jaati he
 Actually the report of this commission has come but till date it could not be implemented
 kaha jaataa he ki agar swaminathan ayog kii report ko lagu kar diya jaae to kisaanon kii takadir badal jaaegi
 The National Farmers Commission was set up by the Central Government on 18 November 2004 under the chairmanship of MS Swaminathan to make the supply of food grains reliable and to improve the economic condition of the farmers
 is ayog ne paanch report saunpi thi
 The Swaminath Commission report emphasizes on increasing land reforms
 atirikt or bekaar jameen ko bhoomihinon main baantnaa, adivasee kshetron main pashu charaane ke haq yakini bananaa or rashtriya bhoomi upyog salaah seva sudhaaron ke vishesh ang hai
 Special emphasis has also been given in the recommendations of the Commission to solve the problem of farmer suicides, create state level farmer commissions, increase health facilities and strengthen the state of finance-insurance
 newtam samarthan mulya (msp)ausat laagat se 50 fisadi zyada rakhane kii sifarish bhi kii gai he taaki chote kisaan bhi mukaable main aaen, yahi iskaa makasad he
 The minimum support price of farmers' crops should not be limited to a few cash crops, with the aim to launch rural knowledge centers and market intervention schemes have also been recommended

 ) kings ilevan punjab ke liye IPL ke beete 10 sijan bhale hi achche na rahe hon lekin is baar team acha karti jarur najar aa rahi he
 The team, led by r Ashwin, has won 2 out of 3 matches so far and is placed third in the points table after Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders
 sijan se pehle aswin ko team kii captaini die jane pehle kuch sawaal khadey hue the lekin unki tin ne bataur captain unki bhoomika par muhar laga di he
 The team registered a big win by 6 wickets in their first match played against Delhi and then stacked CSK in front of a mountain-like score in the third match played on Sunday
 haalanki duusare match main punjab ko RCB ke haathon 4 wicket se haar mili
 Clever captaincy: Ashwin, who is captaining an IPL team for the first time, seems to be taking decisions with full acumen on the field, the inclusion of Chris Gayle in the playing XI in the last match is a result of that
 aswin jaanate the ki CSK ke paas koi aisa pesar nahin he jo gail ko pareshaan kar sake jabaki gail medium pesars ke saath balle se krur bartaav ke liye jane jate hai
 The last match also showed the result of feeding Gayle and he smashed csk's bowling attack by scoring 63 runs
 aswin ne nateezon kii samiksha kar apni ranneeti main bhi pherbadal kiya he
 Ashwin got 5 over spinners during the power play in the match against RCB but the strategy was changed against CSK
 is match main punjab ke paas bada score tha isiilie aswin ne atake na karte hue apana score bachaane kii ranneeti banaai or spin bowler se sirf ek over karaayaa
 The record has been poor: Kings XI Punjab have played the final only once in the last 10 seasons
 punjab kii team 2014 ke IPL filan main KKR se haarane ke baad upavijeta rahi thi
 In the 2016 and 2015 seasons, Punjab's team was ranked the lowest in the table
 is dauraan team ne 28 main se sirf 7 match hi jite the
 The team finished fourth in the playoffs last season
 is baar punjab ko nae captain or kai nae khilaadi mili hai
 The team has foreign players like Chris Gayle, David Miller and Aaron Finch who are capable of changing any match
 vahiin yuvaraj singh, keel rahul, manoj tiwari jaise gharelu khilaadiyon ne bhi khud ko kai maukey par sabit kiya he
 Captain r Ashwin himself is also a very talented player but this season as a captain is no less than a litmus test for him
 gendbaaj ke rup main bharat ke liye vah kai karname kar chuke hai lekin IPL main unhen apane frenchiji ke liye khud ke saath-saath team kii kaabiliyat ko aage bhi sabit karnaa he

 i used to tell a lot of stories about Grandma Guru Nanak
 "main bhi to unki hi aulad hum

 It has to be forcibly seated on the back seat

 Grandma does not answer
 vah jaanati hai ki gusse main bibi ji aise hi bolaa karti hai
 Bibi would then start her dear abuses, which i used to sweep from my body and my mind as if the cat stood up after getting drenched in the rain
 ek din to maine bibi ji ko kah hi diya, "sab gaaliyaan aapako waapas lautaa deen maine bibi ji
 i did not keep one with myself
 aap hi rakhen inhen sambhaal kar
 "what was it then! It was a rage
" "mujhe gaali detii he
 She abuses her father
 ye dekho ji apni ladli ko, mere saamne zabaan ladaati he
 "bibi said to Papa ji as if due to him, i have dared to show abusiveness or gained courage
 "itani gaaliyaan mat do use! itnaa tang mat karo ki vah tumhaare julm ke khilaaf tumhaare hi saamne khadi ho jaae

 Bibji abused me badly
 maine bibi ji kii gaaliyaan unhen waapas lautaa deen
 i did not abuse any of my mouth
 "meri nanheen samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki yah gaali dena kaise hua ? maine to koi apshabd nahin bolaa tha
 Mother had said all of them
 maine to keval tark diya tha
 'does arguing mean abusing?' i would ask the 'good' girl in solitude
 ‘tark gaali nahin hota, katu hota he
 "good" girl says
 ‘par tark sach to hota he na! main kisi kaa jhooth nahin maanuungi
 Everybody calls me bad
 tum mujhe acha kahati ho na! bas yahi kaaphi he mere liye
 i would say to a 'good' girl and comfort my mind
 praayah samay nikaal kar main ‘acchhee’ ladki se batiyaa jarur leti thi
 Surrounded by accusations and accusations, when i was completely alone, that same 'good' girl would make me laugh, encourage me, support me
 vah ‘acchhee’ kahkar mujhe pukaarti thi

 It happened that most of the people licked from the chaat shop, after which the condition of some people started deteriorating
 dekhte hi dekhte gaanv main 37 logon kii haalat kharaab ho gai or gaanv ke tyohaar kaa maahaul gamgin ho gaya
 When the sick people were taken to a nearby health center, no doctors were found there
 iske baad marijon ko lekar das kilometre dur phulpur praathmik swasth centre par ilaaj karana padaa

 ’ Leaving aside the storms and deaths in it, Ujjain Simhastha has two of the most talked about things - BJP national president Amit Shah's three-day international idea Mahakumbh at Samratan Snan with Dalit monks and the Sangh patronage
 isane dharm or raajnneeti kaa kuch aisa mail banaaya ki virdohi bhi chit hote dikhe
 The saffron camp cleverly carried out the strategy
 vaise to ise vaicharik bauddhik samagam kaa naam diya gaya jisamen shiksha, swasthya, krishi, mahila shashaktikaran, jivan mulya, vigyaan or dharm ke bich sambandh jaise vibhinn vishyon par charchaa hui
 But the saffron family's strategy is to increase its social base by focusing on the lowest strata of the society through all these ventures
 isliye madhya pradesh kii shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar ne sangh kii sidhi dekharekh main is vichaar kumbh kaa aayojan kiya
 The script of the event was written about a year and a half ago, when the Modi government's image on the issue of land acquisition ordinance started becoming pro-corporate
 is abhiyaan ko gati us vakt mili jab 20 april 2015 ko loksabhaa main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 'suut-boot kii sarkaar' kaa tamgaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath chaspaan kar diya tha
 After that, after discussing different forums in the sangh-bjp, the idea of the idea Mahakumbh was woven in Simhastha
 sutron kii maane to yah bijepi kii purvavarti jansangh ke sansthaapak pan
 Deendayal Upadhyay's birth centenary year was part of the celebrations
 sangh kii ranneeti aakhir he kyaaise tarah kii gatividhiyaan aage duusare rajyon main bhi karne kii ranneeti he
 But BJP is moving towards implementing the message emanating from this brainstorm
 vichaar mahakumbh ke sanyojak bijepi saansad anil madhav dave kehete hai, ''jivan jeene kaa sahi tarika kya he, yahi aayojan kaa saarvbhaumik sandesh tha, ab isamen madhya pradesh sarkaar yaa anya sarkarein jo kar sakati hai, karengi
 That is, the roadmap to spread the agenda of intellectual gathering, especially in the BJP ruled states, has come out of the village of Ninaura
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''pan
 The recent controversy over the removal of Nehru from the course by the BJP government of Rajasthan is part of the same agenda that weakened due to allegations of saffronisation during the Vajpayee government
 lekin ab gathbandhan kii majaburi nahin he, isliye sangh kii soch ensiiarti ke paathyakramon main bhartiya manishiyon, devi-devataaon or aadhyatm ko jodne kii he
 However, the Sangh believes that such a change cannot happen in a day, so the atmosphere can be created only through a series of big events like Kumbh
 mahakumbh ke udghaatan main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bhi sanket die, ''ham samaaj main parivartan laane ke liye vaataavaran nirmit karen
 Today the atmosphere is created, but we need to work in that direction
 '' bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ne bhi 'vaicharik drushti or samaaj' par ek satr ko sambodhit kiya
 The strategy of the saffron family is to increase the ideological-political base by making inroads into the lower strata of the society, so that the Sangh is able to realize the society it has been planning to organize for three generations
 yahi vajah he ki sangh ke sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi teenon din manthan main maujuud rahe
 Disputeer has said on bathing of Dalits, do not ask the caste of a monk
 raajnneeti iske thik ulat he
 As part of the strategy, a bath program was held in Simhastha with Dalit monks on May 11, which included BJP national president Amit Shah
 pehle ise shabari snaan kaha gaya, baad main saamaajik samarasata snaan naam gadha gaya
 The saints and saints strongly opposed it, and finally the 'saint bath' took place
 haalanki dave ise media kii upaj bataate hai, ''nadi main to sab ek hai, phir samarasata vaali baat kahaan se aati he?'' lekin sutron ke mutabik, bijepi kii ranneeti iske jariye dalit card khilne or upi vidhansabha chunaav main mayawati ke vot bank main send lagane kii he
 The BJP sitting eyeing this vote bank, the Buddhist monk Dr
 dhamm virio mahthero ke netritv main dhamm chetana yatra bhi shuru kar di he
 In this, a group of 60-70 Buddhist monks are going to Buddhist Viharas and creating an atmosphere in favor of BJP
 is yatra kii puri nigaraanee bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv arun singh ke haathon main he, jo rojaanaa kii report banaate hai
 Although he does not associate this campaign with Simhastha's Dalit bath, but listen to his words, "prime Minister went to Babasaheb Ambedkar's birthplace Mhow, but Mayawati did not go there till date
 ambedkar ke naam par jitna kaam modi sarkaar ne kiya he, utana aaj tak nahin hua
 "the BJP argues that if Modi talks about Dalit monks or Dalit, backward communities, it means poverty and poor
 modi ko chahie indira vaali 'garibi'bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki isi ranneeti ke tahat modi sarkaar ne suut-boot kii sarkaar vaali chhavi badalane kii disha main kadam badhaayaa
 After making the general budget village-poor focused, the BJP insisted on strategizing according to the social equation
 darasal, iske peeche bijepi or piem modi kii ranneeti garibon ke himachati hone kaa vahi tag hasil karne kii he, jo kabhi purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke saath judaa tha
 a senior BJP leader says, "indira stuck the word poor with a slogan like 'garibi Hatao'
" lekin ab ek khalipan he or sonia gandhi-rahul gandhi us chhavi ke saath khud ko jodne main naakaam rahe hai
 To fill the same void, Modi wants to add the poor word with his name
 ''bijepi ke is netaa kii daleel he ki aam bajet ho yaa phir samvidhan par sansad main charchaa kar dow
 Increasing Ambedkar's stature, taking up the task of development of the places connected to him, playing the dalit-adivasi-backward card by not paying attention to any upper caste in the recent appointment of five state presidents is part of the same strategy
 party kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii yojanaayen bhi—stand ap india, mudra bank main dalit mahila ko karj dena anivaary, piem jivan suraksha yojana ke jariye 12 ru
 The scheme and Ujjwala scheme have also been made keeping in mind the poor
 dalit udhyamiyon ke liye bajet main praavdhaan bhi usee ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 It is evident that the Ninaura idea Mahakumbh and Dalit Snan Simhastha also became controversial
 lekin bhagava brigade kaa maananaa he ki iske jariye usne us soch ko saakaar karne kii disha main kadam aage badha diya he, jisamen nichle tabake ke logon ko vikaas se jodate hue vaicharik or rajnatik str par bhi sangh-bijepi se joda jaae
 Amitabh Bachchan is deeply in love with his granddaughter Aaradhya and granddaughter Navya Naveli

 nageshwar raav kii niyukti ke khilaaf varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 Alok Verma was removed from the post of CBI Director by the High Power Selection Committee (select Committee) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 iske baad nageshwar raav ko sheersh jaanch agency kii dobaaraa kaman di gai thi
 After the controversy in the CBI in October 2018, the government had forcibly sent director Alok Verma and special director Rakesh Asthana on leave
 iske baad nageshwar raav ko antarim nideshak banaaya tha
 Alok Verma reached the court against this decision of the government
 beeti 8 janvari ko supreme court ne verma ko nideshak ke pad par behaal karte hue kaha tha ki sarkaar sibiai nideshak ko nahin hataa sakati he, sirf select cameti hi hataa sakati he
 This was followed by a three-member selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which included Mallikarjun Kharge, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and Justice AK Sikri, a Supreme Court judge as the Chief Justice's representative, by a 2–1 majority to Alok Verma from the post
 Was removed
 sarkaar ne abhi tak koi nayaa nideshak niyukt nahin kiya he, isliye nageshwar raav hi antarim nideshak bane rahenge
 That is, he can continue in this post for about 3 weeks, but Prashant Bhushan has objected to this decision, so he has filed a petition in the Supreme Court
 court ne asthana maamle main khaarij kar di thi yachikisse pehle prashanth bhushan ne rakesh asthana ko vishesh nideshak ke rup main niyukt karne ke khilaaf bhi supreme court main apil kii thi, lekin court ne yachika khaarij kar di thi
 He then filed a review petition, but this was also rejected by the court
 iske baad unhone curative pitishan daayar kii, lekin disambar, 2018 main nyaayalay ne yah yachika bhi khaarij karte hue prashanth bhushan ko fatkaar lagaai thi

 Ramdev appealed to Lalu Prasad to play the role of an ideal Yaduvanshi and leave the Congress party to make Modi the next PM of the country
 nitish par ramdev baba ne saadhaa nishaanaa
 
 
 Putting a question on Modi's secular image, Ramdev said that any statement should be made for political gains if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was opposing the candidature of the Prime Minister, said that the atmosphere in the country was being created in his favor
 The air of the country decides 125 crore people here, not any political party and any person
 vartmaan main modi hai sabase lokapriy
 
 
 Ramdev said that whether it is a survey conducted by different agencies or the ground reality, if anyone is currently the most popular in this country, he is indisputably Narendra Modi
 nitish dwaara purv main bihar kaa ambesder banaae jane vaale ramdev ne unpar nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki chaahe koi modi kii lokapriyata ko kisi tarah kii hawa bataaen vah unki vyaktigat raay hogi par hakeekat yah he ki desh main jo hawa bani hui he vah narendra modi ke paksh main he

 He said that he would campaign against Congress President Sonia Gandhi, his son and party vice-president Rahul Gandhi in Rae Bareli and Amethi during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii tarif karte hue ramdev ne unhen vishwasaneey bataaya or kaha ki vah modi ko pradhanmantri banane liye ghar-ghar jane kii apane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat aagaamee ek march se karenge

 # sudharjaaowarnasudhaardenge— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag)february 14, 2019 On the independence anniversary this year, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that the journey in DTC and cluster buses will be free for women of the capital from October 29
 deepawali ke baad bhaidooj ke din is ghoshnaa par amal shuru ho gaya
 This in itself can be called the first experience of the world where such a large class is being provided free travel
 haalanki vipakshi dalon ke netaa ise kejariwal kii chunavi ghoshnaa bataa rahe hai
 On this, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) says that the public chooses the government that does good work
 dilli sarkaar kii taraf se is suvidha ko shuru karne ke peeche jo daleelein di gai hai, ve raajnneeti se alag hai
 Jasmine Shah, who is considered a think tank of the Delhi government and vice-president of the Dialogue and Development Commission of India working on transport reforms in the capital, says, "44 lakh people travel daily in the buses of the capital and about 30 percent of them are women Huh
 bason main muft safar kaa makasad mahilaon kaa shashaktikaran karnaa or unako barabari par laana he
 The government had conducted a survey before this announcement in which it was found that women do not take advantage of employment opportunities because of distance and insecurity
 bason main mukrat safar or har bas main marshall tainaat kar donon masalon ko hal karne kii koshish gai he
 "the participation of women in the total workforce in India is around 24 percent," says Shah
 dilli kii workforce main mahilaon kii bhagidaari 11 fisad he
 But in other developed or developing countries this average is around 48 percent
 ise dilli main badhanaa jaruri he
 However, about 4 on the first day
 77 mahilaon ne muft bas seva kaa laabh uthaaya
 There are 5,600 buses plying in Delhi and around 1
3 million women travel daily
 muft bas yatra par sarkaar salanaa 350 karod ru
 Will spend har safar par 10 ru
 Will be given to DTC
 muft safar kii bason main asi, non-asi, cluster basen, airport jane vaali basen, sab shaamil hai
 Not only this, wherever these buses are going in noida-gurgaon or National Capital Region, women will not have to take tickets
 bujurgon or vidhyaarthiyon ko bhi muft bas yatra kii saugat dene par dilli sarkaar main vichaar chal rahaa he
 The Delhi government claims that women have benefited the most from its steps so far
 mohalla clinics kaa zyada istemaal mahilaayein karti hai kyonki pariwaron main mahilaon ke swasthya par kharch se bachane kii pravriti he
 When the Delhi government first announced the free bus journey, then it was said that the metro should also be free for women
 is par party ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj kehete hai, ''dilli sarkaar ne prastaav metro or centre sarkaar ko bhej diya he
 The Center had asked for six to eight months to prepare a technical blueprint of the proposal
 vakt biit chukaa he
 As soon as the center gets the green signal, the Delhi government will pay Rs
 de degi
 "by the way, if the Center gives the green signal, then the metro will benefit only because more women traveling will increase their earnings
" vidhansabha chunaav se kuch maheene pehle muft yatra kii shuruyaat ko congress or bhaajapa raajnneeti bataa rahi hai
 But Chief Minister Kejriwal says, "the public is happy with this decision
 janata khush he to siten aa jaaengi
 Bhardwaj also believes that the public chooses a government that does good work
 haalanki ghoshnaa ke maamle main bhaajapa bhi peeche nahin rahi
 a few days ago, the NDA government at the Center announced regularization of Delhi's illegal colonies
 in donon ghoshnaaon main kiskaa rajnatik parinaam zyada gaharaa dikhegaa? iske jawaab main rajnatik vishleshak abhaya kumaar dube kehete hai, ''muft bas yatra kaa phayda turant hua isliye janata kii twarit pratikriya dikhegi
 However, if the public benefits in political battles, such announcements are welcome

 bihar main satta se baahar hui congress kii sthiti chaay main duube biscuit kii tarah ho gai he, jo kabhi bhi tut sakati he
 The Congress has 27 mlas in Bihar, but the situation here is such that they have no role and are forced to remain with the RJD
 sutron kii maane to rajya ke kai congress netaa argedy ke saath is gathjod se ub chuke hai or kareeb 9 vidhayak jediu ke sampark main hai
 However, this Congress leader denies such reports
 party ke hi ek netaa naam naa jaahir karne kii shart par kehete hai, bihar main bhale hi argedy supremeo ko bhrashtachar or parivaarwaad ke aaine se dekha jaataa he, lekin rashtriya str par dharmanirpeksh takaton ko ek manch par laane main unki bhoomika ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 There is an exercise of any grand alliance at the national level for the Lok Sabha elections, that is not possible without Lalu
 isi vajah se congress alaakaman bhi argedy ko alag rakhkar kisi raajnneetik sameekaran kii baat nahin sochataa
 The relationship between the RJD and the Congress is very old, which began in 1997 when Sitaram Kesri was the Congress President
 iske baad varsh 1998 main sonia gandhi congress adhyaksh bani or is dauraan unhenlalu prasad yadavaka puraa saath mila
 At the same time, when Lalu's government caught in the fodder scam was in crisis, the Congress supported and raised it
 haalanki bihar main jediu or argedy ke saath mahagathbandhan tuutane ke baad bihar main congress uhapoh kii sthiti main fansi dikh rahi he
 Its leader-legislators are desperate and they do not understand what will be the way forward
 bhrashtachar kaa aarope jhel rahi argedy ke saath vah apni naiya kaise paar lagaayenge
 The biggest resentment of Congress leaders is about the silence of the party high command
 congress ke adhikansh sthaneey netaaon kaa maananaa he ki tejasvi yadav ke maamle main agar alaakamananithish kumaarake saath rahane kaa nirnay le leti to shayaad yah din dekhnaa na padataa
 Due to these complaints after losing the power of Bihar, Congress leaders are now looking for an alternative
 rajya main congress ke 27 vidhayak hai, aise main jaankaron kii maane to aane vaale dinon main agar party tuutati he, to kisi ko aashcharya nahin hona chahie

 ) Former foreign minister k Natwar Singh on Wednesday claimed that Sonia Gandhi refused to become prime minister in 2004 following the bitter objections of her son Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ne aisa isliye kiya kyonki unako dar tha ki agar vah pad sweekaar leti hai to unke pita or daadi kii tarah unki bhi hatya kar di jaaegi
 Singh, 83, once considered a friend of the Gandhi family, left the Congress in 2008
 iraq ke anaaj ke badale tel ghotaale kii prishthbhumi main 2005 main samprag-1 se unhone istipha diya tha

 html indian council of medical research (ICMR) ne 2005 main pehali baar sarogesi (kiraaye kii kokh ke) maamle main niyaman kaa prayaas kiya tha
 It drafted a National Guideline for Recognition, Nig Queen and Regulation of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Medical Services in India
 ART ke tahat ivief (kritrim dhang se nishechan) ke jariye banjhapan kaa vikalp taiyaar kiya jaataa he or bhrun ke vikaas ke liye kiraaye kii kokh kaa istemaal hota he
 This effort led to the 2008 ART bill
 yah 2010 or 2014 main bhi sansad main pesh kiya gaya lekin paas nahin ho sakaa
 In 2009, the Law Commission took cognizance of this and emphasized the rights and obligations of both parties involved in surrogacy, citing the need for regulation of ART medical services
 ayog ne sirf 'paroapkaar' ke liye sarogesi ko anumati dene kii baat kahi or commercial sarogesi ko prati bandhit karne kii sifarish kii, jise 2016 ke sarogesi bill main shaamil kiya gaya
 The bill was reviewed by the Parliamentary Committee on Health and Family Welfare
 2017 main samiti ne apni report main suzav diya ki pehle ART bill laayaa janaa chahie kyonki alag se koi sarogesi clinics seva nahin hoti
 Surrogacy is usually offered under ART clinics
 samiti kaa nishkarsh tha ki 'samay kii maang he ki ART clinics ko le kar kanoon banaaya janaa chahie'
 The committee also noted that the 2014 ART bill covers all aspects related to it
 haalanki, sarkaar ne is salaah ko nazarandaaj kiya
 The Surrogacy Bill of 2016 was reintroduced in Parliament in 2019 and passed in a hurry from the Lok Sabha
 ab rajyasabha ne ise usee sansadeey samiti ke paas bhejne kaa faisla kiya he
 What's in the bill? The bill proposes a surrogacy board at the national level
 isi tarah rajya or centreshasit pradeshon ke str par bhi sarogesi board honge
 Officers will be appointed to regulate the process and procedure of surrogacy
 yah kanoon commercial sarogesi yaa sarogesi ke liye maanav bhrun kii kharid-bikri par bhi pratibandh lagaataa he
 In this, registration has been made mandatory for surrogacy clinics offering surrogacy services in any form
 bill ke praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan karne par kam se kam das saal jail kii sajaa or 10 lakh rupee jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he
 The Bill allows only 'moral altruistic surrogacy' for married Indian couples
 iske liye mahila kii umr 23-50 or purush kii umr 26-55 ke bich honi chahie
 In addition, the couple must have passed at least five years to be legally married
 'paropkaaree sarogesi' kii paribhaasha main kaha gaya he ki saroget madar ke medical kharch or insurance cover ke alaava yah bina kisi kharch ke, bina paise yaa fees ke honi chahie
 The bill also states that the surrogate mother must be a close relative of the beneficiary, also a woman who is 'married and has her own child' and must be 25-35 years of age
 kisi bhi mahila sirf ek baar saroget madar ban sakati he
 Such a womb can be removed only if the surrogate mother has written permission and the appropriate authority is also allowed
 vidheyak sarogesi se paidaa hone vaale bachche kaa parityag rokane kaa bhi praavdhaan karata he or uske ve saare adhikaar sunishchit karata he jo ki kisi jaivik putr ke hote hai
 Why was the bill introduced? The bill says that without law, surrogacy will become an uncontrolled commercial profession, there will be immoral acts, surrogacy will be exploited, children born with surrogacy will be abandoned and for surrogacy, human embryos and eggs or sperm Purchase can also be sale
 kanoon ayog kii sifarish par yah prastaav laayaa gaya he jo saroget maanon or bacchon ke adhikaron ko suraksha pradaan karata he
 Unheard Concerns of the Parliamentary Committee In 2017, aside from the concerns of the regulation, the Committee recommended several important changes, with the Parliamentary Committee stating that ART Clinics should be regulated first
 jise 2019 ke bill main nazarandaaj kar diya gaya he
 Therefore, the need to send the bill back to the same panel is beyond comprehension
 sansadeey samiti ne sifarish kii thi ki is vidheyak main 'kareebi rishtedaar', 'banjhapan' ko paribhaashit kiya janaa chahie
 Only the provision of 'philanthropic surrogacy' should be removed
 kisi vivaad kii surat main aaropee khud ko nirdosh siddh kare yah praavdhaan bhi hataanaa chahie
 There should be no provision for written permission for abortion of a woman
 samiti ne sarogesi ko 'kareebi rishtedaar' tak simit karne or ise 'paropkaaree’ banane par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki saamaajik, kanoonee, bhaavnaatmak or naitikta ke chalate paariwarik dabaav ke kaaran mahilaon ke saath jabardastee kii jaaegi or unka shoshan hoga
 The committee said that restricting surrogacy to 'close relatives' (which have not been defined) would not only reduce the availability of women, but also have no relation with preventing the exploitation of surrogacy women
 isliye mahila labhaarthi kii rishtedaar ho yaa na ho, donon haalat main use anumati milani chahie
 The committee also questioned the provision stating that surrogacy can be resorted to only after five years of marriage and child birth
 jabaki vishwa swasthya sanghathan or 2014 ke ART bill main yah samay sirf ek saal kaa rakhaa gaya he
 Such restrictions will reduce one's chances of becoming a mother, as people nowadays marry late anyway
 yah logon ke prajnan ke adhikaar kaa bhi ulanghan karata he
 The committee suggested that there should be a provision for one year and the rest should be left for medical reasons
 samiti ne sirf kanoonee rup se shaadishuda or unhen banjh hone ke praaanpatr kii shart par bhi aapatti jataai thi
 Describing the condition of the certificate as unnecessary, the committee said that restricting it to married couples would prohibit widows, divorced women, live-in couples from becoming parents
 kisi mahila ke saath banjh hone kaa laanchhan jod dena nyaaypurna nahin he
 The parliamentary committee also wanted to know what is the rationale behind the denial of compensation to the surrogate mother, who would go through a period of nine months and even after that, while paying the doctors, hospitals and lawyers involved in the process Will be done
 iske alaava, samiti ne yah bhi suzav diya ki garib mahilaon ko unki paariwarik jaruratein puri karne ke liye sarogesi kii anumati di jaani chahie
 The panel had some other recommendations that were ignored: the definition of surrogacy should be accurate, there should be clear and descriptive provisions so that there was no scope for misinterpretation, and the ban on donating eggs or dried crystals was removed, deadlines for abortions were set The provision of written permission should be removed without doing so, because the reasoning behind it is not clear and the 1971 Pregnancy a about abortion t is already seeking the right to decide the district medical board with security
 medical birdari kii mili juli raichandigarh ke pijiai or dilli ke ladi hording main padhaa chukin mashhoor streerog-ivief visheshgy or indian medical association se judin dow sharada jain is bill ko acha kadam bataati hai
 She welcomes the abolition of commercial surrogacy and restricts it to 'single parents'
 unka kahana he ki videshon se jitne log commercial sarogesi ke liye bharat aate hai, unamem se 90 fisadi samalangik samudaay se hote hai, na ki ve log jinke liye sarogesi kaa koi matlab he
 However, they agree with the parliamentary committee's recommendation that the ART bill should come first and the definition of 'close relative' should be clear

 Indian Test captain Virat Kohli today announced that the re-fit Lokesh Rahul is the team's first choice as an opener, almost ending Gautam Gambhir's chances of playing in the current Test series against England here
 rajkot main pehle test ke dauraan duusari pari main bhartiya ballebaaji ke dhwast hone ke baad rahul ko rajasthan ke khilaaf maujuuda ranjai trophy match ke bich se hataakar bhartiya team se jod diya gaya
 After Rahul's first choice, it seems that the career of senior opener Gambhir is almost over, who is returning to Test cricket after more than two years
 kohli ne duusare test kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘hamaare dimag main yah bilkul saaf he ki murali vijay ke saath lokesh rahul hamaari pehali pasand he
 He can be fit anytime, he is returning to the team and we will start with him
 chaahe iske liye use pratham shrenee match ke bich se hataanaa pade
 This is according to the rules
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen uske jald se jald ubarne kii ummid he
 This is how team composition is made, you go with the decision that you think is best for the team
 mujhe nahin lagata ki rahul ko waapas bulaane ke liye hamen kuch alag tareeke se sochane kii jarurat thi
 We are happy that he is once again in the team
 ’tippaniyan Gambhir played two Tests in the absence of Rahul
 unhone newjiland ke khilaaf 29 or 50 jabaki england ke khilaaf 20 or shunya ran kii paariyaan kheli
 Kohli said that Gambhir played very well under different circumstances
 chunki murali vijay pehle test kii pehali pari main shatak banane main safal rahe the
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that Rahul will start the Indian innings with victory in Visakhapatnam Test
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) rahul ke pehali pasand banane ke baad aisa lagata he ki senior salaami ballebaaj gambhir kaa kariyar lagbhag khatm ho gaya he jo do saal se adhik samay baad test cricket main vaapasi kar rahe hai
 Kohli said on the eve of the second Test, 'it is very clear in our mind that Lokesh Rahul is our first choice with Murali Vijay
 vah kabhi bhi feet ho saktaa he, vah team main vaapasi kar rahaa he or ham uske saath shuruuaat karenge
 Whether for that he has to be removed from the middle of the first class match
 yah niyamon ke anusaar he
 "he said," We hope to recover from him as soon as possible
 team kaa sangyojan isi tarah banataa he, aap us faisle ke saath jate hai jise team ke liye sarvshereshth samajhate hai
 i don't think we needed to think in a different way to get Rahul back
 ham khush hai ki vah ek baar phir team main shaamil he
 Comments rahul kii gairmaujuudagi main gambhir ne do test khele
 He played innings of 29 and 50 against New Zealand while 20 and zero against England
 kohli ne kaha ki gambhir alag-alag halaat main kaaphi acha khele
 Since Murali Vijay was successful in scoring a century in the first innings of the first test
 aise main is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki vishakhapatanam test main vijay ke saath rahul hi bhartiya pari kii shuruyaat karenge

 Curfew-like conditions were created throughout the valley, making it difficult for people to move out of their homes
 kai dinon ke liye kashmir kaal-kothri jaisaa ho gaya
 Four people (kavita Krishnan, Maimuna Mulla, Vimalabhai and I) left for Kashmir on 9 August to see and understand the situation there
 ham paanch din vahaan rahe
 We spent the first two days in Srinagar
 ham shahar main har taraf ghoomte rahe, vahaan ke bashindon se baat karte rahe
 Then we hired a car and traveled to Sopore, Bandipora, Pampore, Pulwama, Anantnag, Bijbehara and many villages along the way
 aksar ham checkpost jaise-taise paar kar gaye
 However, once or twice we had to turn around or turn back

 Most people in rural Kashmir have large and beautiful homes and are well nourished

 This is also confirmed by official figures
 jammu or kashmir ke saamaajik sanketak nishchit rup se gujarat se behatar sthiti main hai, jise pradhanmantri adarsh samajhate hai
 This is highlighted in several key indicators of development — for example life expectancy (74 years in Jammu and Kashmir compared to 69 years in Gujarat), full-immunization coverage of children (75 percent in Jammu and Kashmir compared to 50 percent in Gujarat ) And the ratio of the number of rural poor (12 percent in Jammu and Kashmir and 22 percent in Gujarat)

 sanyog se, jammu-kashmir kii gramin arthvyavastha ke apekshaakrit samrudh or samtawadi hone kaa ek pramukh kaaran yah he ki yahaan 1950 or 1970 ke dashak main vyapak bhoomi sudhaar hue the
 Land redistribution was possible through Article 370 — at that time, the right to property was a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution, but in Jammu and Kashmir this law was not in force because it had its own constitution
 aam dharna he ki jammu or kashmir ''pichhadaa'' ilaaka he or anuchhed 370 is pichhadepan ke liye jimmedaar he lekin is baat kaa hakeekat se koi vaasta nahin
 Since we went all the way to Kashmir, and everywhere we felt that anger and fear have gone home in the minds of people
 srinagar main kashmir ke bhaajapa pravaktaaon ke alaava, hamen aisa koi bhi shaks nahin mila jo anuchhed 370 ko nirast karne ke faisle kaa samarthan karata ho
 On the contrary, there was a lot of anger in the people about this attempt to seize the autonomy of their state
 aisa nahin he ki kashmir ke log swaittata se santusht the

 Dulat has also said openly, "nominal" was left

 An elder in Batmaloo said, "made the whole of Kashmir a prison
" 
 
 hamen baandh kar anuchhed 370 ko hataaya
 Many other people also said similar things
 krodh kii tarah, bhay bhi gaharaa gaya he
 No one agreed to speak on camera
 ham jab bhi logon kii baaten record kar rahe the, hamen iskaa dhyaan rakhana padataa tha ki unke chehre camere main kaid na hone paaen
 We did not even write the names of the people, so that there is no doubt in their minds
 logon ke darane kii vajah he—5 agast ko bharat ke kadam ke baad logon kii khub girakratariyaan hui hai

 anumaan yah he ki sabhi mahatvapurn netaaon, aayojakon or virodhiyon ko yaa to giraftaar kar liya gaya yaa phir hawalat main daal diya gaya
 Among them are also leaders of 'liberal' political parties who advocated dialogue with India
 jaisaa ki kisi kashmiri shaks ne kaha, ''jo india ke geet gaate the, unako bhi jail bheja gaya
 "the position of pro-india leaders in Kashmir has become embarrassing, their credibility crisis has arisen and this can give a boost to radical elements
" ek yaa do sthanon par jahaan ham thodi der se suraksha balon kii najar se baahar the, or jahaan hamaare aasapaas ek choti-si bheed jamaa ho gai thi, logon ne kuch naare lagane kaa jokhim uthaaya, ''ham kya chaahate hai?'' 'azaadi', 'anuchhed 370 waapas lao!', ityadi
 But they soon dispersed
 ye virodh haalanki bahut chote lag rahe the, lekin swat: sfoort ye chote-chote virodh kashmir kii us pratirodh kii samskruti kaa pratik hai jisaki jaden gahari hai

 Till then there were few incidents of protest, but this was because the situation like curfew remained and all the means of communication were stopped

 No matter how peaceful the protests are, they are not allowed in Kashmir, and the mass demonstrations soon turn into ugly confrontations with the security forces, given the brutal methods of controlling the crowd there
