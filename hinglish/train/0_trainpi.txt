 Shiv Sena argues that the NDA could not find a candidate, hence the party is supporting Pranab da
 haalanki shivasena kah rahi he ki pranab ko samarthan kaa matlab congress ko samarthan nahin hota

 For this, they put the NDA in the dock
 uddhav kii in baton se saaf he ki endie ke andar ahm muddon ko lekar gahari khai bad rahi he
 This is the reason Uddhav also wants to get the picture clear about the NDA PM candidate for 2014 on the lines of Nitish
 lekin, jab unase poocha gaya ki kahin pranab kaa samarthan kar wo congress ke saath to khadey nahin dikhenge, uddhav ne kaha, 'ham dada kaa samarthan kar rahe hai congress kaa nahin
 However, there is no wrong indication from this decision, in view of this, Uddhav did not fail to clarify that Shiv Sena will not turn to the NDA and the common fight against Congress will continue

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed concern about the waste of food in hotels and restaurants in the Mann Ki Baat program
 aise main ab NDA sarkaar hotels or restaurant main khaane kii seemaa tay karne ja rahi he
 Ram Vilas Paswan, Minister of Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution System, has called a meeting with the food industry to discuss what should be the standard dose limit for food served in hotels and restaurants

 ye bhojan or paison donon kii barbaadi he
 Paswan said that my personal experience is, sometimes the price of a bottle of water in a restaurant is something else, something outside, or something else on the plane
 kai baar khaanaa khaane jate hai to dekhte hai ki khaane kii barbaadi hoti he
 In our poor country where people are hungry, food wastage is not good in this way, so we have taken this step in the interest of the consumer

 They should voluntarily say what amount will be given to a man in a portion of food
 ek chapatti he ki do, ek idli he ki do idli he
 For example, if you give a prawn, you say that three prawns will remain in a post or four
 paswan ne yah bhi saaf kiya ki ham in maamalon main koi sarkari niyantran nahin tay kar rahe hai, bas upabhokta ke hit kii baat kar rahe hai

 Asked what is the proposal of the government in this regard, Ram Vilas Paswan said, "we said that the industry should be asked whether they can take voluntary steps in this regard or any legal provision will have to be made for this
" wo swechha se kahen ki ek aadmi ko bhojan ke ek porshan main koun si cheez kitni maatra main di jaaegi

 inamen anusuchit jati, janajati or saamaanya varg ke 12,19,930, pichhadaa varg ke 10,80,806 or alpsankhyak varg ke chaatro kii sankhya 81,621 he
 10 every year on the reimbursement of fees of all these students

 Is spending
 yahi raashi nijee college prabandhakon kii jebon main ja rahi he
 As soon as the investigation started, clutches began to open in every district
 mathura ke do ejineering collejon ne fees pratipurti ke liye die gaye 2
 36 crores Rs
 chaatro main baante hi nahin
 The Chief Development Officer here has been ordered to investigate the case and recover the fees
 is ghotaale main college prabandhakon kaa saath jila samaaj kalyaan adhikariyon ne bhi diya
 The allocation of fee reimbursement amount given to poor students studying in Mahamayanagar was violated against the City Engineering College at Tikri Kalan in Aligarh district
 jaanch se jude ek adhikari ke anusaar, zyaadaatar collejon ne fees pratipurti ke liye di gai raashi kaa laabh paatr chaatro ko nahin diya
 These colleges also took fees from students and also grabbed the amount of fee reimbursement received from the government
 jaanch ke liye chune jilon main 100 se zyada collejon main praarambhik jaanch main hi aniyamitata pai gai
 10 crore given for reimbursement of fees on two engineering colleges of Mathura, Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Mahamayanagar
 se adhik raashi ko hadapney par mukadmaa darj karaayaa gaya he
 The maximum number of 70 colleges in the capital is on the radar of investigating officers
 inamen se kai to aise hai jinamein paathyakram samaapt hone ke baad chaatro kii fees pratipurti raashi shashan se jari hui lekin in collejon ne paatr chaatro ko yah raashi nahin lautaai
 The biggest problem has been the reimbursement of fees of students of general and backward classes
 is varg ke chaatro se fees jamaa karaane ke baad collejon ko sarkaar se milane vaali fees pratipurti raashi ko paatr chaatro ko lautaane kaa niyam he
 Investigation has revealed that the college management did not give the full amount of the fees deposited to the students by half
 shesh raashi college prabandhan ne bhagdaud ke naam par khud rakh lee, lekin register main puri raashi dene kii baat likhakar us par chaatr ke hastakshar kara liye
 This register should be checked periodically
 chaatro ko milane vaali raashi kaa bhautik satyaapan karnaa chahie lekin jimmedaar adhikari is ore se aankh munde rahe
 a high official of the Social Welfare Department says that the way the flaws are coming out in the initial investigation itself, it seems that this scam will be worth several billion
 is adhikari ke mutabik,''aisa nahin he ki is puure ghotaale main ejineering or management college prabandhan hi shaamil hai
 The District Social Welfare Officer and other personnel working under him have also warmed their pockets in Bandarbat for the fees reimbursement money of the students
 ''sabhi jiladhikariyon ne mukammal tareeke se jaanch ko anjaam bhi nahin diya he
 Departmental sources say that after the expiry of one month, only 15 district magistrates have sent their reports to the government
 zyaadaatar ne apni report main ek line kaa jawaab likhaa haih ''jaanch main koi aniyamitata nahin mili'' jabaki shashan ne unase college kaa naam, unamem padhgaye vaale paatr chaatro kii sankhya or aavantit fees pratipurti kii raashi samet kai binduon par jaanch akhya bhejne ko kaha tha
 The government has taken this answer of one line seriously and they are being asked for a repeat inquiry
 samasya keval samaaj kalyaan vibhaag se hi judi nahin he
 Due to lack of budget, the matter of reimbursement of fees of backward class students is getting complicated
 yah prakaran lakhanu vivi se judaa he
 Here, there is a lot of tussle between the University and Backward Classes Welfare Department regarding fee reimbursement
 iskaa nateeja he ki kareeb 3,000 se adhik obisi chaatro ke bhavishya par sankat mandaraane laga he
 After the scam was exposed, the Social Welfare Department has started to strengthen its system
 balvinder kumaar ke mutabik, ab fees pratipurti kaa puraa paisa chaatro ke khate main sidhe bheja jayega
 Students will get reimbursement amount only after online verification of caste and income certificate
 aisa toll free number jari kiya jayega jis par fees pratipurti kii rakam nahin paane vaale chaatr shikaayat kar sakenge
 However, until the government enforces the rules, the arbitrariness of private colleges will continue and in the absence of government support, poor parents will have to put their all at stake to teach their meritorious children

 It is alleged that 750 buildings in Delhi's Dharmapura area were wrongly given heritage building status

 Which is already going through financial crisis

 jab isapar sawaal uthe to uske aas-paas ke 750 buildings ko bhi heritage kaa darja dilava diya
 Which the Northern Municipal Corporation incurred an annual loss of 25 crores

 yahi donon ne ek saal pehle brazil ke salinopolis shahar main ek chota sa ghar bhi kharid liya or unhen ummid he ki jald hi unke ghar main ek nanhe-munne mehmaan kii kilkaariyaan goojengi
 In any case, Alissanny wants a child for herself

 Despite these conditions, the couple are very positive about their future and they hope that their lives will be full of happiness
 romantic prapojal ko yaad karte hue elisani kahati hai, 'maine usase kai baar kaha ki mujhase shaadi ke liye mat poochna kyonki meraa jawaab na hoga'
 According to Francialdo, a construction worker, "I always wanted to be with a tall girl and she came into my life and my dream came true"
 ab donon mangani kii taiyaari kar rahe hai or bahut jald hi puure tamzam ke saath shaadi bhi karenge
 At the same time, Alisaini has already prepared a wedding gown for herself
 jab donon sadak par ek saath nikalate hai to raah chalate log unhen ghur-ghur kar dekhte hai, lekin francinaldo ko isse koi fark nahin padataa
 He says, 'I always want to be with it

 My friends ask me to introduce them to Alsaini, but she refuses because she is ashamed
 elisani bahut alag kism kii insaan he or mujhe pataa he ki use kaise khush rakhana he

 There are many calls for some magic medicine for weight loss, but so far no such discovery has been made
 lekin internet par daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ek aisi jaadui dawa khoj lee gai he jo “bina eksrasij or bina diet santulit kiye ek kilo vajan pratidin gata sakati he
 ”this claim is also being made on Facebook, many web pages and some blogs
 duble hone kii jaadui dawaai?yahdavapratishthit santhaan ol india institute of medical science (ames) ke ek 'doctor' kii bhavukta bhari naatakeey kahani ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he
 It is being said that "the doctor's 33-year-old brother died of heart attack due to obesity, after which the doctor devoted his entire life to this discovery
" ”is kahani ke mutabik, doctor kaa naam ramesh bhargav he jo ki ames ke “bioijineering” vibhaag main professor hai
 The archived version of this post can be viewed
 kya he sach?india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki “ames ke doctor kii pratidin ek kilo vajan ghataane vaali is adbhut khoj” kaa daawa puri tarah farji he
 This fake article with a fictional sentimental story of AIIMS doctor is sponsored by a company's marketing
 yah company motaape kii dawa bechati he
 This article is being spread on the Internet through a blog
 chunki motopa ek vyapak samasya he or ek pratishthit santhaan ke naam kaa istemaal karke logon ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he, isliye AFWA ne isaki sachai saamne laane kaa nishchay kiya
 We found that this is a cleverly designed conspiracy to cheat people who are troubled by obesity and want to get rid of it
 koun hai ramesh bhargav?viral ho rahe lekh main yah “adbhut khoj” karne vaale ames ke jis doctor kii kahani gadhi gai he, uskaa koi astitv hi nahin he
 There is no doctor named Ramesh Bhargava in AIIMS
 lekh main istemaal tasviir main doctor kii poshaak main jis aadmi ko dikhaaya gaya he, vah darasal ek model he jo doctor kii poshaak main dikh rahaa he
 It has appeared in numerous advertisements and has its photos on the photo website Shutterstock
 iske alaava, daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ramesh bhargav ames ke “bioijineering” vibhaag main professor hai, jabaki ames main koi “bioijineering” vibhaag nahin he
 It is not possible that if a person is a professor in AIIMS, he will mispronounce the name of his department
 phir bhi, andeh ko pukhta karne ke liye hamane ames ke biomedical ejineering vibhaag kii professor veena kaul se baat kii or poocha ki kya is naam kaa koi doctor unke vibhaag main he? unhone puri tarah nakaarte hue kaha ki unke vibhaag main is naam kaa koi doctor nahin he
 According to him, “I have been working in this department for the last 30 years and i can definitely say that there was never a doctor of this name here
 ”kaalpanik doctor ke kai chehregugle par hamane is lekh ke kuch kiwards ke sahare google search kiya to hamen hoobahoo yahi story kai gumnaam si websites or blog par bhi mili jinamein aisa hi daawa kiya gaya he
 After reading this article carefully we found an interesting thing which proves that this story is completely fake
 jahaan jahaan is dawa se sambandhit lekh hamen mili, us har lekh main ames ke doctor kii kahani to ek jaisi hi he lekin doctor kaa naam or photo badali hui he
 In one article, his name is written as Dr Siddharth Kumail, while in another article his name is written as Dr Rahul Mongia
 hairaan karne vaali baat to yah he ki lekh main doctor ke jis chote bhai kii motaape se maut kii kahani likhi gai he, uskaa naam or umr sabhi lekhon main vahi he
 His name is described as 'kapil'
 hamane paaya ki doctor kii jin tasveeron kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, unhen internet se liya gaya he or un tasveeron kaa is farji prachaar prapanch se koi sambandh nahin he
 Fake story for selling slimming pills In all these articles, people are being directly or indirectly motivated to buy obesity medicine, which is being called Garcinia Cambogia

 On this website named com below, a phone number (0124 450 7500) has been given for any kind of information
 hamane is number par kai baar phone karne kii koshish kii lekin yah number har baar ancering mashin mod main rahaa or koi jawaab nahin mila
 Who is doing this fraud? On looking at the domain registration details of Nutralyfe website, we came to know that this website belongs to a company named Nutravo Lifecare Pvt Ltd
 yah company udyog vihaar, gudgaanv, haryana kii he
 The registration details of this company reveal that the directors of Nutravo Lifecare Pvt Ltd are Vipul Taneja, Nipun Taneja and Amit Chauhan
 hamen nipun taneja or amit chouhan se phone par sampark karne main kamyaabi mili
 Nipun admitted that he is the director of this company and brother of Vipul Taneja
 vipul taneja hi is form ke pramukh vyakti hai
 However, when we wanted to get detailed information about this company, they disconnected the phone and switched off
 hamane amit chouhan se bhi baat kii jo ki is company ke duusare diarector hai
 He admitted that his company markets a drug called Garcinia Cambogia
 ames ke doctor ke bare main sawaal poochne par unhone email ke jariye jawaab diya, “hamaare zyaadaatar marketing partner bharat ke baahar ke hai
 We do not know that the name of an AIIMS doctor is being used
 ”vipul taneja-nutravo Lifecare kaa mukhiyavipul taneja kii linkedinpropailake mutabik, ve Adsparkx Media ke siio, Nutravo Lifecare Pvt Ltd ke diarector or public spikar hai
 According to the website of Adsparkx Media, it is an internet marketing company associated with mobile advertising and brand promotion
 in donon companiyon ke mukhiya vipul taneja hai
 This raises the legal question of whether they use their Internet marketing skills to create misleading advertisements and increase sales of Garcinia Cambogia
 amit chouhan ne apane email main daawa kiya ki “adsparkx ek swatantra nikaay he or Nutravo Lifecare Pvt Ltd se iskaa koi lenaa dena nahin he”
 We tried many times to reach Vipul Taneja to know more about the activity of these two companies
 Adsparkx kii website par die unke number par kol kiya lekin na to unhone phone uthaaya or na hi palatakar kol kiya
 What is Garcinia Cambogia? Garcinia Cambogia is the botanical name of a plant that belongs to the family Clusiaceae

 Brij Bhushan said, "we cannot force anyone to participate in the camp
 ve senior khilaadi hai or agar ve apana training kaarykram taiyaar karti he
 Which we approve
 yahi kaaran he ki ham shivi main junior khilaadiyon kaa utsaah badhaate hai

 The WFI is also looking for Japanese coaches for the Greco Roman and Women's section
 brijbhushan ne kaha, "ham yuva videshi kochon kii talash main hai

 yah ajeeb sthiti he

 WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is expected to do well from the wrestlers
 is bich unhone gita or babita ke apane pita mahavir phogot ke maargdarshan main training ke faisle kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 Now nobody knows that these two will return to the camp
 brijbhushan ne kaha, "ham kisi ko shivi main hissaa lene ke liye baadhya nahin kar sakate
 She is a senior player and if she prepares her training schedule
 jo ham sweekruti dete hai
 That is why we encourage the enthusiasm of junior players in the camp
 " When asked if the WFI Phogat sisters would recommend the name while her father is also receiving government grants due to her being the coach, the WFI president did not respond to the question

 This news came last month and now three of these Mi25 Russian gunships have also reached Kabul

 Of all the arms deals that have been done in this part of the world, this is probably the most important and the least noisy
 asal main afghanistan kii is tarah ke hathiyaaron kii maang nai nahin he
 Even the UPA government stopped giving such weapons to him
 afgaani sarkaar rus se sidhe bhi hathiyaaron kii maang kar chuki he, lekin abhi kii stithi donon deshon main (bharat or afghanistan main) badali he

 Such a situation can have a direct impact on India as well, its feeling is here

 duniya ke is hisse main jitne hathiyaaron ke saude hue hai unamem se ye shaayad sabase ahm or sabase kam shorgul ke saath kiya gaya he
 Actually, Afghanistan's demand for such weapons is not new
 yahaan tak ki upie sarkaar bhi use aise hathiyaar dete-dete ruk gai thi
 The Afghan government has also demanded arms directly from Russia, but the current situation has changed in both countries (in India and Afghanistan)
 afghanistan se nato force nikal chuki hai
 He gave the Afghan police and army all the training, but every day attacks of the Taliban, attacks in tightly guarded areas inside Kabul, the occupation of many cities and towns and the growing influence of the Islamic State also alerted the Afghan government and the public
 have make
 is tarah ke halaat kaa sidhaa asar bharat par bhi ho saktaa he, iskaa aihsaas yahaan he
 India has so far confined itself to building roads, buildings and training its military forces in Afghanistan
 vahaan ke sansad bhawan kaa nirmaan bhi bharat ne hi kiya he, jise aadhikarik taur par pradhanmantri narendra modi shuukravaar ko kabul kii apni pehali yatra par raashtrapati abdul gani ko saunp sakate hai
 Several times on behalf of the US, India was asked to give military support to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, but India remained far away
 ek vajah ye bhi thi ki bharat, rawalpindi ko bevajaah bhadakaana nahin chahta tha
 Pakistan has been continuously accusing India of trying to increase its influence in Afghanistan
 pakistan, afghanistan main majboot pakad chahta he, kyonki isse use bharat ko gherne or dabaav banane main madad milegi
 The help and support of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI to terrorist organizations such as the Haqqani network operating in Afghanistan is not a hidden thing
 lekin ab lagata he, bharat ne is rawalpindi factor ko nazarandaaz karne kaa faisalaa kar liya he
 Not only is this largely a result of a new circular foreign policy of India, but it is also an attempt to change the way of talks with Pakistan
 aise main yaa to pakistan in mahaz chaar helicopteron ko nazarandaaz kar degaa yaa ek baar phir afghanistan main bhartiya thikaanon par hamale badhenge or kashmir main or aatanki bhejein jaaenge
 The comments lekin is helicopter saude se ye to saaf he ki bharat kii afghanistan niti main badlaav aayaa he
 Russia has not objected to giving this helicopter to Afghanistan, this is also a big change

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar hit back at Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray, saying that he is hungry for publicity and has nothing to do with democracy
 tippaniyan On Raj's statement that the people of Bihar living in Maharashtra were 'infiltrators' last week, Nitish told reporters here, "raj Thackeray is doing all this for publicity and has nothing to do with democracy
 " Nitish wondered how in such a situation, when the Maharashtra government is unable to control a person like Raj, how will he fight terrorism
 maharashtra main rah rahe bihar ke logon ko pichley saptaah 'ghuspaithiya' bataane ke raaj ke bayaan par nitish ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "raaj thakare yah sab publicity ke liye kar rahe hai or unka loktantr se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 " nitish ne is par hairaani jataai ki aise main jabaki maharashtra sarkaar raaj jaise ek vyakti par niyantran nahin rakh paa rahi he to vah aatankwaad se kaise ladegi
 Nitish wondered how in such a situation, when the Maharashtra government is unable to control a person like Raj, how will he fight terrorism
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar kii tarj par hi vipaksh modi sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laayaa he
 The Lok Sabha Speaker, while approving the no-confidence motion, has set Friday for discussion and voting
 vaajapeyi sansad ke sadan main avishvaas prastaav ke khilaaf hui voting main jeet gaye the, lekin kuch maheene ke baad hue chunaav main unhen satta se vidaa hona pad gaya tha
 Now it is the turn of PM Modi, who will face the challenge of proving himself in the Assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha elections to be held in a few months, along with passing the litmus test of the House
 modi sarkaar ke khilayevishwaas prastaav aise samay aayaa he, jab chunaav main ek saal se bhi kam samay bachaa hua he
 NDA has sufficient number, in such a situation is not showing any crisis in front of the government
 aise hi vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke paas bhi 2003 main bahumat ke aakade the
 Despite this, the Congress, along with the opposition, brought a no-confidence motion against the Atal government in 2003, as they had given George Fernandes the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense
 vaajapeyi ke netritv main pehali aisi gaiyr-congressi sarkaar bani thi jisane apane kaarykaal ko puraa kiya tha
 After this, the second government is now headed by Narendra Modi, who seems to be completing his five-year term
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ke khilaaf aae avishvaas prastaav ko endie ne aasaani se paar kar liya tha
 While the BJP had less than a majority of seats at the time, the BJP currently has 273 mps
 2003 main vaajapeyi sarkaarake khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ko endie ne bahut hi aaraam se vipaksh ko voton kii ginati main haraa diya tha
 The NDA got 312 votes while the opposition was reduced to 186 votes
 avishvaas prastaav par voting se tamilnadu kii eidiemke or faruk abdulla kii party neshnal conference ne khud ko alag rakhaa tha
 Whereas the BSP voted in favor of the Vajpayee government
 vaajapeyi ke khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan tatkaaleen vipaksh kii netaa or congress kii us samay adhyaksh raheen sonia gandhi ne sadan main hindi main bhaashan diya tha or unhone vaajapeyi sarkaar ko kai morchon par asthir bataaya tha
 In the same way, when Sonia Gandhi was asked if you had enough numbers after the motion of no confidence was brought against the Modi government, her reply was, who says we do not have numbers? In Parliament against the Vajpayee government The Congress lost the House in a no-confidence motion
 is jeet se utsahit hokar vaajapeyi ne loksabhaa chunaav ko samay se pehle karaayaa tha
 But in the electoral fray, the NDA led by Vajpayee could not win and he had to leave from power
 2003 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ke khilaaf aae avishvaas prastaav ke kuch dinon ke baad hi chaar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hue the
 After this, the next year, 2004 Lok Sabha elections were held
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke chunaavon par iskaa prabhaav padaa
 The BJP undoubtedly won here but its seats were reduced earlier
 iske baad saal 2004 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke netritv main upie ko jeet mili
 The timing of the no-confidence motion against the Modi government is the same
 haalanki is baar congress ke dwaara laae avishvaas prastaav ko manjuur nahin kiya gaya he, balki tidipi dwaara andhra pradesh ko special stats ke liye laayaa gaya he
 Despite this, the timing of the motion of no confidence is the same
 kuch maheenon ke baad madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main chunaav hone hai
 The BJP has governments in all three states
 congress in rajyon main satta kii vaapasi kii ummid lagaae hue he
 The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are due after one year
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki piem modi bhi atal kii tarah loksabhaa chunaav ko samay se pehle kara sakate hai, jabaki congress unhen maat dene ke liye vipakshi dalon ke saath gathbandhan karke chunavi maidan main utarana chaahati he
 In 2004, the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi had mixed several parties to defeat Atal
 ab rahul bhi usee formule par aage bad rahe hai
 It has to be seen whether the history of 2003 is repeated again or Modi will write a new speech in 2019
 agra ke kothi minaa bazaar main 21 november ko bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne pradesh sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa makhul udaaya tha
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who came to Agra on Wednesday, gave a befitting reply to Modi
 patrakaron ke sawaalon ke jawaab main akhilesh yadav ne modi kaa naam liye bina kaha ki duusare pradesh ke log upi ke bare main kya jaanate hai?unhone kaha, 'upi kaa prachaar nahin hua he, lekin main pradesh ko gujarat se behatar banaakar dikhaaungaa
 The Chief Minister said that UP and Agra are known as Taj Mahal abroad
 soobe kaa vikaas is tarah se hoga ki upi ko 'home aaf da taj' ke naam se janaa jayega
 Akhilesh said, 'taj Mahal and Agra have been lucky for the socialists
 yahaan ke tourism ko badhaane ke liye tajmahal ke aasapaas ke vikaas ke liye 140 karod rupee ke project par kaam shuru hoga
 The BSP was building the government's inner ring road on the PPP model, but now it will be built with government funds
 land parcel ke naam par kisaanon kii jameen jabaran nahin lenge
 The Chief Minister informed that the government is considering to build an airstrip on nearly 60 acres of land on the agra-firozabad road
 prashasan ne bhi civil terminal banane kaa vikalp rakhaa he
 To provide employment to the youth, the state government is launching a big program in the state soon
 mukhyamantri ke mutabik is mishan ke tahat yuvaaon ko short turm takniki prashikshan diya jayega
 About 600 training programs will be run
 yojana kii shuruuaat 21 janvari ko hogi
 The Akhilesh Yadav government of Uttar Pradesh overturned another decision to withdraw the controversial decision to allow mlas to buy vehicles up to Rs 20 lakh from its regional development fund
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne buudhvaar ko apane sarkari awaas par samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki sarkaar ne vidhayakon ko apni kshetreey vikaas nidhi se 20 lakh rupee tak kaa vaahan kharidne kii ijaajat dene kaa nirnay waapas le liya he
 He said that after this decision, no MLA will be able to buy vehicles from his fund
 gauratlab he ki akhilesh ne mangalvaar ko vidhansabha main kaha tha ki ab vidhayak apni kshetra vikaas nidhi se 20 lakh rupee tak kaa vaahan kharid sakenge
 He had said that interested mlas would be able to buy vehicles at the HMS price
 paanch saal ke baad vidhayak hmas mulya chukaakar us gaadi par malikana haq paa sakenge
 However, the government will not pay them the maintenance costs of the vehicle
 iske purv, sarkaar ko pradesh main vyaapt bijli sankat se nipatane ke liye sabhi shoping maal or vyavsaayik pratishthanon ko shaam saat baje band karne ke haal ke nirnay ko vipaksh or vyapaaree sanghathanon ke kade virodh ke kaaran waapas lenaa padaa tha
 Akhilesh Yadav had said in the House on Tuesday that this would help the mlas who cannot afford their vehicles to visit the area
 baharhaal, basapa or bhaajapa samet vipakshi dalon ko sarkaar kaa yah faisla raas nahin aayaa tha
 He said that this would send a wrong message to the public
 bhaajapa vidhanmandal dal ke netaa hukum singh ne kaha tha ki vidhayakon ko apni nidhi se vaahan kharidne kii ijaajat dene se janata main acha sandesh nahin jayega or bhaajapa kaa koi bhi vidhayak apni nidhi se vaahan nahin kharidega
 BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya also said that the government's decision was wrong and said that the government should make a separate arrangement to buy the car
 vidhayak nidhi se gaadi kharidne se galat sandesh jayega
 However, now Maurya welcomed the withdrawal of the decision to buy the car from the Vikas Nidhi, saying that it was a result of the sharp opposition by his party
 udhar, congress pravaktaa akhilesh pratap singh ne kaha ki vah iskaa swaagat karte hai
 The government should take back this step, feeling the sentiments of the opposition parties and the public, then it should be welcomed
 is bich, bhaajapa pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki sarkaar aakhir aise faisle kyon leti he, jinhen use waapas lenaa padataa he
 He said that it seems that the advisors of the government do not understand the sentiments of the public
 champiens trophy se pehle hi baahar ho chuki bhartiya team ko doum darje kii westeindies team se aupchaarikta kaa match jeetne main bhi kaaphi pasinaa bahaanaa padaa or 130 ran kaa maamuli lakshya usne 32 
 Achieved after losing 1 wicket by playing 1 over
 austrailia kii pakistan aaj do wicket se romaanchak jeet ke saath hi bharat kaa isisi champiens trophy se boria bistar bandha gaya
 He had to pray for the victory of Pakistan along with defeating the West Indies to reach the semi-finals but luck did not support Mahendra Singh Dhoni this time
 westeindies kii sitarahin team ko 36 over main 129 ran par sametane ke baad bharat ne yah lakshya 32
 Achieved by losing three wickets in 1 over
 viraat kohli ne 104 gend main naabad 79 ran banaaye jisamen nau chauke or do chakke shaamil the
 Earlier, Praveen Kumar and Ashish Nehra took three wickets each while bowling well but the batsmen were disappointed after playing in a slow manner
 is saal yah isisi kaa doosraa toornament he jisamen dhoni kii team semifinal main nahin pahunch saki
 Earlier in the Twenty20 World Cup played in England in June, India were eliminated from the Super Eight stage
 westeindies main 2007 main khele gaye 50 overon ke vishwa cap main bhi bharat pehle daur se baahar ho gaya tha
 In the Champions Trophy, Pakistan beat India by 54 runs while their match against Australia was canceled due to rain
 bhartiya janata party ne somvaar ko loksabhaa chunaav ke chauthe charan main hue matdaan ke baad puri birbhum loksabhaa par dobaaraa chunaav karaane kii maang kii he
 Apart from this, some seats in Asansol, many polling stations in Krishnanagar and Ranaghat are being demanded for repoling
 bijepi ne rajya ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari se is maamle main sampark kiya he
 State BJP vice-president Jayaprakash Majumdar blamed Birbhum district president Anubrata Mandal of the Trinamool Congress, accusing him of mass electoral malpractices in Birbhum
 unhone kaha, "chunaav ayog ne anubrat mandal par nigaraanee rakhane kii yojana banaai thi taaki vah loktantr ko khatra nahin pahunchaa saken, vah khulkar kah rahe hai ki unhen koi fark nahin padataa
 "the BJP state vice president also said that we have demanded re-election in the entire Birbhum parliamentary constituency and in Baraboni, Pandeshwar (both Asansol), Chakdah (ranaghat) and Chhapra (part of Krishnanagar)
 jaiprakash majumdaar ne trinmul par pranaligat tareeke se hue chunaav main herapheri karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki yah trinmul congress kii ranneeti he ki unhone chunaav yojit karvaa rahe adhikariyon se yaa to kaam nahin karne liye yaa phir der se pratikriya dene ke liye kaha he
 Their other strategy is to spread violence in people and frighten them
 iske alaava kendriya balon dwaara birbhum ke dubrajpur vidhansabha main hui firing ke bare main jab jaiprakash majumdaar se poocha to unhone kaha ki kendriya bal ne apane bachaav main firing kii thi
 It also said that it is a matter of shame for the state that there are reports of jamming of booths here and denying people their franchise
 uttar pradesh jaise rajyon main jahaan kaaphi kadaa muqabla he, vahaan netagan bahes kar rahe hai, vahaan se to kahin bhi hinsa kii koi khabar nahin thi
 In fact, in the fourth phase on Monday, once again there was fierce violence in West Bengal, due to which TMC and BJP supporters clashed everywhere
 asanasol main tiemasi waalon ne bijepi pratyaashee babul supriyo kii gaadi tod di
 The uproar was so intense that the security personnel had to use force and the miscreants were lathi-charged and
 ghatana ke baad kendriya mantri babul supriyo ne matdaan centre par kendriya surakshabalon kii tainaati kii maang kii
 After this the BJP and TMC reached the Election Commission
 donon ne ek duusare ke khilaaf ayog main shikaayat kii or chunaav ayog ne kendriya mantri babul supriyon ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne kaa nirdesh de diya
 On the 7 questions asked by Rahul Gandhi's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Dr
 Jitendra Singh has answered
 jitendra singh ne bataaya ki aaj rahul gandhi ne kuch galat aankade diye the
 That figure is withdrawn after the protest
 jitendra singh ne bataaya ki rahul gandhi ke prashnon kii monitering ham pehle din se hi kar rahe hai
 We have studied the questions given on their behalf every day
 vahiin congress ke netaa arpyen singh ne is mudde par kaha ki rahul gandhi koi galat aankade nahin de rahe hai
 Jitendra Singh Answer the questions Rahul is asking
 piem khamosh hai
 What happened to 15 lakhs, what happened to 2 crore jobs every year
 gujarat me moongfalee or kapaas ke kisaanon se kiye vaade kaa kya hua
 There are many questions to which they do not have answers
 isse pehle jitendra singh ne kaha ki tarkon ke aadhaar par or aankadon ke aadhaar par yah pramanit kiya he kiraahul gandhiko aankadon kaa vishleshan unki samaj main nahin aayaa hota he yaa phir vah apni suvidha anusaar in aankadon ko project karte hai
 Jitendra Singh further said that Rahul Gandhi has once again given incorrect figures, a lot of information is coming in the media about this
 jitendra singh ne yah bataaya ki rahul gandhi ne mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar ke jo 5waan sawaal kiya tha usko lekar ke hamane yanipradhanmantricaryaalay kii taraf se jaankaree di gai thi
 The question was asked counter which part of Gujarat is it that after going to Rahul Gandhi it was realized that women are not safe here? According to Jitendra Singh, Rahul Gandhi was told that Gujarat is a place which the whole world knows that most women feel safe here
 der raat tak mahilaayein garba aadi se ghar lautati he
 This was the answer to the sixth question, Dr
 Jitendra Singh said that it was Rahul Gandhi's sixth question, in that too many figures were distorted
 jitendra ke anusaar rahul ne kaha ki gujarat main bahut bhayankar berogari he, hamaare jo pramanit aankade hai uske mutabik vahaan berogari 0
 9 percent
 neshnal everej se agar tulana karen to vah 5% he
 Jitendra further said that the information given by Rahul's team in this way is given wrong information
 jitendra ne bataaya ki agar rahul gandhi yaa phir unki team ke log arthshaastra samajhate hote to shaayad is tareeke ke sawaal vah pradhanmantri se nahin karte
 He is manipulating the figures and presenting them, which is wrong
 puri tareeke se gujarat main berogari kii baat jo lagaataar rahul gandhi kar rahe hai, vah hakeekat nahin he
 According to Jitendra, Rahul Gandhi is unable to understand that the condition of Congress-ruled states is worst
 academic drushti se rahul gandhi jis tareeke kii baaten kar rahe hai vah puri tarah se aniatik he
 According to Jitendra, Rahul Gandhi will have to study more to become an economist
 rahul kii team ke logon ko aankadon kaa sahi se vishleshan kar desh kii janata ke saamne rakhana chahie
 The second cricket Test match between India and Australia starts here on Saturday
 yahaan kii wicket kaaphi tej maani jaati he or usamen oochaal bhi he lekin bhartiya captainmahendra singh dhoniko isaki koi phikr nahin he
 Before the match, Dhoni said that he is not worried about India's record of defeat in Gaba
 unhen lagata he ki bhartiya team is tej wicket par badhiya pradarshan karegi
 He said that he has no fear of this lively wicket
 dhoni ab apni chot se ubar chuke hai or buudhvaar ko team kaa netritv karne ko taiyaar hai
 Australia has always been strong in Brisbane
 yahaan kii wicket tej he or usamen oochaal bhi he jisase baahar se ai tiimon ko pareshaani hoti he
 And in the case of India it is very much
 iskaa hi parinaam he ki aaj tak khele gaye paanch maichon main bharat kabhi nahin jeeta
 Dhoni said that if you talk about statistics, it is correct
 lekin bharat ne tej viketon par kai match jite hai chaahe vah johanansburg ho yaa durban yaa phir perth
 Dhoni himself has never played in Brisbane
 unhone kaha ki mere noujvaan khilaadiyon ke liye yah nai chunauti he or ve yahaan kaaphi kuch seekhenge
 He said that i hope that my players will stand with time and perform well
 gaba main australia aakhri baar 1988 main haara he jab viv richards kii team ne unhen nau viketon se maat di thi
 India last played a match with Australia in Gabba in 2003 when Saurabh Ganguly scored a century here and the match was drawn
 us match main bharat ne pehali pari main badhat bhi lee thi
 Dhoni said that i usually like wickets that have little greenness
 isse pratidwandvi team ke khilaaf hamaare gendbaaj zyada prabhavi ho jate hai or ballebaajon ko waisi vikaton par ran banane main dikkat hoti he
 Dhoni also said that we have done well on such wickets which are suitable for fast bowlers
 isse pratidwandvi team ke ballebaajon ko out karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 He said that we could not cash in on Test conditions in the last few series and could not win
 ve aise match the jo bharat jeet saktaa tha

 com / 22p62v2ou5— ANI (@ani_news)june 6, 2015 'mulla Radio' has become silent after the killing of Mullah Fazlullah, Pakistan's most feared terrorist
 america ne drone hamale main taharik-e-taliban pakistan (TTP) ke sargana fajalulla ko maar giraaya he
 The US targeted terrorist Mullah Fazlullah in Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province
 aatanki fajalulla vahi he, jisane pakistan ko sabase zyada khun ke aansu rulaayaa
 However, Fazlullah was raised by Pakistan and sheltered him
 pakistan ke peshawar sthit army skool main 150 se zyada maasoom bacchon kaa katleam karne main fajalulla kaa hi haath tha
 Pakistan's most dangerous terrorist was Fazlullah
 Fazlullah is the name of the most dreaded face of terror in Pakistan and on one of its gestures, the Taliban is killed in death
 ye wo shaks tha, jisane pakistan kaa switzraland kahi jane vaali swat ghati ko na sirf nark main tabdeel kar diya, balki uske napak mansoobon ne kai baar pakistan ko khun ke aansu rulaayaa
 Swat Valley of Pakistan
 behad hi khubasurat is ilaake kofjalullahne aatank kaa garh bana diya tha
 Every day his new fatwas created a sense of awe in the hearts of people that people were shivering in the name of Fazallulah
 yahaan har kisi ke chehre par fajallulaah kaa dar or khauf kaa saaf dikhaai detaa tha
 Women came out of the house with a burqa and the children were afraid to go to school
 fajalullah ne banaaya mullah radiupane sasur sufi mohammad ke saath milakar fajalullah ne swat ghati main aatank kii hukumat kabiz kar di
 On the day of his arrival on the radio Taliban played a disgusting game in the name of religion in the Swat Valley
 kabhi mahilaon ko ghar se nikalne kaa fatwa, kabhi bacchon ko skool naa bhejne kaa farmaan to kabhi sangeet sunne par maut kii sajaa dene kaa elaan
 Fazallulah's face became more dangerous with every decree
 jis kisi ne fajallulaah ke farmaanon kii andekhi karne kii jurrat kii to use mili maut kii sajaa
 So the women got the punishment of public whip
 jiske baad to kisi ne bhi fajallulaah ke saamne sir uthaane kii himmat nahin kii
 Fazal Hayat was the birthplace of Namfazlullah who killed more than 150 innocent children in a school in Peshawar, Pakistan
 iskaa paidaaishi naam fazal hayaat tha
 Born in the Swat district of Pakistan in 1974, this Pashtun militant Deoband was a supporter of Sunni Islam and wanted to implement Sharia law in Pakistan
 behad kattar vichaardhaara kaa fajalullah usee samudaay se aata he, jis samudaay se nobel prise vijeta malala yusufajai aati hai
 Fazlullah was arrested in 2005 by the government of Pakistan
 is dauraan usne jail main hi rahakar tamaam dharmik kitaaben padhin
 It was from there that his fundamentalism began
 jail se chhootane ke baad usne pakistan kii sarkaar or kattarpathiyon ke bich samjhauta karavaaya, jiske evaj main pakistan sarkaar ne use malcond jile main sharia kanoon lagu karne kii ijaajat de di
 Fazlullah gradually strengthened in the area of swat Valley after it had raised more than 4500 fighters
 phir usne khoonkhaar aatanki batulla mahsood se haath mila liya
 By the year 2007, it formed an army of 4500 fighters and started its rule on 59 villages of the Swat Valley
 10 july 2009 ko pakistani fouj ke hamale main vah jakhmi to ho gaya, lekin batch niklaa tha
 The Pakistani army destroyed its madrasa costing crores of rupees
 iske hamale ke baad fajalulla afghanistan chalaa gaya or vahiin se oparation chalaane laga
 He used to attack Pakistani forces only while staying in Afghanistan
 sharia kanoon kaa tha himaytifjalullah shuru se hi kade sharia kanoon kaa himachati tha or unhen todane waalon ko kadi sajaa detaa tha
 These included even strangling to death
 vah sangeet, tivi, cinema vagairah kaa ghor virdohi tha or aisa karne waalon ko sajaa detaa he
 He set fire to all computer shops in Swat
 fajalullah khaas taur par muslim mahilaon kii talim or unke skool jane ke khilaaf tha
 He bombed ten girls' schools
 jabaki kareeb 170 skulon ko nestnabut kar diya tha
 Malala was attacked in 2012 at the behest of Mullah Fazlullah
 jab fajalullah ke naam kii tuuti bolaa karti thi tab police chhodie paak sena tak uske garh, khaas taur par uske hadquarter kaa rukh karne se ghabraati thi
 This was the same headquarters where Safejalullahtham used to create dangerous conspiracies
 ye vahi adda tha jahaan fajalullah apane kaidiyon ko bandi banaakar unpar julm dhaha tha
 This was the same place where he would sit through mullah radio and issue all death orders
 kai baar aa chuki he marane kii khabarisase pehle bhi pakistan taliban sargana ke maare jane kii khabaren aati rahi hai, lekin wo sabhi khabaren juthi nikaleen
 In 2016 and 2015, it was reported that Fazlullah was among those killed in Khyber Agency air strikes in Tirah Valley, but after that the TTP had called it a rumor and said that their Chief is still alive
 thik isi tarah june 2009 main bhi fajalullah ke maare jane kii khabar ai thi, lekin america media kii maane to is baar shaayad fajalullah batch nahin paaya
 The Kedarnath tragedy has completed six years today
 lekin yatriyon kii bheed ko niyamit karne kii disha main ab tak koi thos pahal nahin ho pai he
 Also, the system of photo metric registration is also hanging in the balance

 Only passengers going on rotation from Rishikesh are being registered, whereas, more than that, passengers are directly reaching Kedarnath by private vehicles or heli services

 supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad tripal talaak par phir bahes chhid gai he
 Some are saying it should be banned, while some people are in favor of it
 par aaj ham iske ek or paksh se aapako rubaru karaate hai
 This is the aspect of its being valid or invalid
 indian express main chhapi khabar ke anusaar, tripal talaak ke bare main pangbar mohammad ne kuch kaha hi nahin tha
 Men later invented it for their own convenience
 rukhsana-rehana kii aapbeetee, teen talaak par khamosh rahane waalon ke khilaaf 'laudspikar'!iske alaava, duniya main kai aise muslim desh hai, jahaan barason pehle hi tripal talaak ko bain kar diya gaya tha
 The number of these countries is not 1 or 2 but a long list
 isamen turki, pakistan or bangladesh jaise deshon ke naam bhi shaamil hai
 Where came the roots of Talakatlak in Arabic language
 jahaan is shabd kaa arth hota he, 'kisi bandhan se mukt hona'
 It is derived from the word 'talaqa', which literally means free
 ek mahila ke sandarbh main iskaa arth he ki uskaa pati use shaadi ke bandhan se mukt kar rahaa he
 He is clearly talking about ending the relationship
 islam main kitni tarah ke talakislam ke jaankaar kehete hai ki islamic kanoon ke tahat do tarah ke talaak hote hai- talaak al sunna (jise pangbar mohammad ke hukum ke anusaar kiya jaataa he) or doosraa, talaak al-bidat (jise baad main paigambar mohammad ke kathin hukmon ke kaaran ho rahi dikkaton se bachane ke liye aarambh kiya gaya)
 According to Indian Express, it was later split into two methods
 pehla, jisamen teen baar talaak kahkar talaak liya jaataa he or doosraa jisamen likhit taur par talaak diya jaataa he

 Furqan Ahmad, Research Associate Professor at the Indian Law Institute, writes, 'the divorce started in the Al Bidat Dasuri century, when the Omayad rulers felt that the rules were very difficult and to avoid this difficulty He discovered this method

 The Pakistani army has claimed that India has not dropped any F16, we did not use it in this operation
 asif gafoor ne kaha ki vah chaahate to bhartiya sena ke thikaanon or prashasnic daftaron ko nishaanaa bana sakate the, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Pakistan shot down by India
 Let us tell you that this claim of Pakistan has come when India killed its F16

 The practice of implementing Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the single tax system across the country has been going on loudly since July 1
 desh kii arthvyavastha main ise aazaadee ke baad kaa sabase bada tex riform mana ja rahaa he
 But amid this reform, lakhs of central government employees are having different concerns
 pehle notebandi ne unhen saatven vetan ayog se badha hua bhatta nahin lene diya
 Because the central government could not take any decision on the allowance of employees due to economic challenges
 ab kendriya karmchaariyon ko dar he ki kahin ek baar phir kendra sarkaar desh ke sabase bade aarthik sudhaar kaarykram ke chalate unke bhatte par apane faisle ko or na taal de
 Significantly, the Central Cabinet is to meet on Wednesday

 Sources in the central government claim that this matter can be taken up in Wednesday's cabinet meeting and a final decision can be taken on it

 Know 10 special things related to dearness allowance in the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission: 1
 kendra sarkaar ke formule ke mutabik mahangaai bhatte par 2 fisadi kii vruddhi di jaaegi jise 1 janvari 2016 se lagu kiya jayega
 2
 karmchaaree unionon kaa maananaa he ki mahangaai bhatta nirdhaarit karne ke liye industrial varkar ke liye kanjumar price index ko benchmark maananaa hakeekat se alag aankade dete hai
 3
 union ke mutabik sipiai ek kaalpanik aankada he kyonki lebar beuro kaa aankada hakeekat se dur rahata he
 4
 mahangaai bhatta badhaane ke liye ausat sipiai aankada 4
 Should remain 95 per cent, which should be considered as the benchmark from January 1 to December 31, 2017
 5
 The central government had increased the dearness allowance by 2 percent in October and implemented it from July 2016, so now it is going to increase it by only 2 percent
 kendra sarkaar pichley 12 maheene kaa ausat khudara mahangaai kaa aankada lekar mahangaai bhatta nirdhaarit karata he
 6
 vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri dene ke baad kendra sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki sabhi karmchaariyon ko janvari 1, 2016 se badi hui selary or bhatta milegaa lekin notebandi lagu hone ke baad kendra sarkaar is mudde par aakhri faisla lene se kataraa rahi he
 7
 notebandi kaa faisla lene ke baad modi sarkaar ne kendriya karmchaariyon ke bhatte par vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko dekhne ke liye ek cameti gathit kar di
 This committee has also been asked to pave the way for implementing the recommendations of the Pay Commission
 8
 According to sources, the committee headed by Ashok Lavasa has submitted its report to the government
 lekin kendra sarkaar karmchaariyon ko bhatta dene main sakasham nahin he kyonki notebandi se desh main cash kii killat kendra sarkaar ko bhi pareshaan kar rahi he 
 9
 saatven vetan ayog ne echaare main 138
 Has increased by 71 percent and 49 in other allowances
 79 fisadi kii ijapha karne kaa prastaav diya he
 During the last few months, the union of central government employees has been pressing the Finance Ministry to make payments at the earliest
 karmchaaree union apni maang ko lekar strike par jane kii baat kar rahi he
 10
 chunaav ayog ke nirdesh or 5 rajyon main chunaav prakriya shuru hone ke baad ab kendra sarkaar karmchaariyon ke bhatte par koi faisle nahin le sakati
 Therefore, it is expected that now the Central employees have no option but to wait till the completion of the election process

 It was designed to bring attention to the needs and challenges of higher education in the context of the New America, the topper and asserting itself in the post-war era

 For example, it strongly recommends that institutions offering formal degrees in education cannot be separate entities in the same discipline of education, rather they have to be established as multidisciplinary institutions

 However, if this draft document would have started with the precise meaning and purpose of education and with the philosophy of practical education science, its recommendations would have been much clearer

 Interestingly, this document adopts the liberal academic format at the undergraduate level, which has many features similar to those we tried at Delhi University

 yah munhaase se lekar, vajan badhaane or hormone asuntalan jaisi anya samasyaayein bhi utpann karata he
 According to him, it is necessary for the prevention of this that if a woman starts to see these symptoms, she should consult a doctor immediately: - Regular menstruation (delayed cycle) -motapa (around the middle area - in the abdomen and thighs) - Ataxia (unwanted hair on face or body) - Oily skin and pimples - Thinning of head hair - Sudden and excessive changes in mood - Reduction in growth of breasts - Tingling

 The best thing about eating a specific PCOS fertility diet is that it can increase your chances of becoming pregnant
 2
 Eating equal amounts of protein and carbohydrates keeps the insulin level balanced and thus increases fertility
 3
 Diseases are kept away from five meals per day, these five meals include three regular meals and two healthy snacks or five small meals
 4

 With them at the other end, wicketkeeper batsman Carlton Ba is playing for 19 runs

 apana pehla match khel rahe ravichandran aswin ne lunch ke baad pehle over main hi derren braavo (12) ke rup main apana pehla wicket liya
 Chandrapal has always been successful against India and even today there is no exaggeration

 unhone saiyad kirmani (198) kaa ricard todaa
 Dhoni also achieved his 200th hunt soon
 aswin ne acchhee farm main chal rahe sampuls ko der tak nahin tikne diya
 Before this right-handed batsman could understand his slider, he kissed his bat and covered it in Dhoni's gloves

 There was a lot of trend of Sarahah app in India at one time, the trend of Face app has started in the same way
 faceapp – ek aisa ap he jo aaj kal bharat main kaaphi popular ho rahaa he
 The news feed is full of such photos in which people are looking old
 ye ap nayaa nahin he, kaaphi pehle se he
 But in India these days it is in trend
 darasal is ap main kai fitures hai jinamein se ek chehre ko boodha dikhaane vaala he
 According to faceapp, the company does this by using Artificial Intelligence Technology
 ye ap 2017 main launch hua tha
 Is it a risk to use it? Does it take full access to your photo library? Such questions are arising in people's minds
 is ap ko na sirf aam yugers balki ab celibrity yuj kar rahe hai or is vajah se ise zyada hip mil rahaa he
 This app uses neural network to edit photos
 neural network artificial intelligence kaa hi ek prakaar he
 Not only Edge but this app can also perform tasks like Younger Look, Gender Swap
 kya kahati he faceapp kii privesi policy?jab bhi aap hamaari sarvice yuj karte hai, hamaari sarvice automaticali kuch log file information record karti he
 These include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, URL and how often you interact with this service

 However, your data can be given to the companies of the face app group, because you have given its content
 company kii policy ke mutabik agar company chaahe to third party advartiging parteners ko kuch jaankariyaan de sakati he
 These include cookery data
 kya ye ap becoground main aapaki photo librari ko cloud par aplod kar rahaa he?is ap ke viral hone ke baad twitor par kuch logon ne ye baat kahi
 However according to security researcher Robert Baptiste this is not the case and no evidence has been found
 lekin jaahir he jis photo ko aap edit kar rahe hai uskaa 100% parmishan aap us ap ko de rahe hai
 Re: faceapp, can't speak to it "uploading" photos but the app is definitely capable to access my library even though i have Photos permission set to "never" 🤔pic

 com / jdmkqu5nml — Karissa Bell (@karissabe) July 16, 2019 a Twitter user posted a video
 ye ios kaa he
 They have questioned how this app can take photos without permission
 is video main unhone ye dikhaaya he ki ios kii settings main unhone Allow face app to access Photos ko NEVER par set kiya he
 That is, they have not given permission to take photos of this app, but then when they open this app, they are able to upload that photo without changing the settings
 BE CAREFUL WITH FACEAPP - the face aging fad app
 It immediately uploads your photos without asking, whether you chose one or not
