 post
 sad
 ekaaki
 Brother, why has he become so lean? baichaiyn
 Sparkling
 sulagta hua
 Why is the mother silent? Why does sister not laugh? Why don't you go to college? How will they get married
 
 
 log
 
 
 Familiar, relative
 
 
 kitna bada parivesh he
 
 
 And he is among them all
 
 
 ghayal
 
 
 His head started spinning
 
 
 andar mashin chal rahi thi
 
 
 Everything kept cropping up
 ghargharaata hua uskaa pahiyaa
 
 
 Presses the chest and rotates
 
 
 papa bataa rahe the ki astidi-pisio vaala ladkaa pakadaa gaya he
 Have identified one of them
 magar baaki kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he
 
 
 She started to flutter after hearing the news
 
 
 vikshobh or vitrushna se uskaa hriday fatne laga tha
 The wood lying in the fire pit was starting to crackle
 pani main aag lagi thi
 It was burning day and night
 
 
 ahernish
 
 
 She was crying
 
 
 
 She used to yearn for the coming days
 
 
 
 Everyone's pressure was increasing how fearless he was in court
 
 
 nirbhikta tathaa himmat se bolnaa hoga
 
 
 every moment
 
 
 bhai kii bandhi muththiyaan use baichaiyn kiye rahati
 
 
 
 usne darwaja kholkar dekha
 
 
 Brother was lying on the bed in front
 
 
 badi mushkil se didi ne khaanaa khilaayaa tha
 He is able to sleep only with a sleeping pill
 diwaar se tikkar baith gayi vah
 
 
 
 aankhon ke saamne kuch chal rahaa he
 
 
 Shadow 
 
 chehre
 
 
 When did i sleep? 
 
 uski
 
 
 The same thing was going on in the dream
 
 
 saamne jaj baitha he
 
 
 Lawyers stand around, parents and family friends together
 vakil usase puche ja rahaa he
 
 
 Question by question
 cheer rahaa he uske hriday ko
 She is tattooing her soul
 maar rahaa he hathaudaa chetana par
 
 
 And is destroying his life
 vah achakachaati jhenpati tadapati-si kabhi sir hilaati he to kabhi niruttar rah jaati he
 
 
 Wants to run, but is not able to run 
 
 sabane usko gherkar rakhaa he
 
 
 He had seen suffering in childbirth in a picture
 
 
 cheekhti
 
 
 a woman who suffers all the pain but suffers from arms and legs
 
 
 bhaag nahin paati
 Can not get up 
 
 mahasoos ho rahaa he use ki uski deh ke saath to ek hi baar balaatkaar kiya gaya tha magar aatma ke saath to
 
 
 These people are raping thousands of times
 
 
 isiilie to aatma chatapata rahi he
 
 
 There is an outcry in the heart
 
 
 use laga-gale main saansen ataki hui hai
 
 
 The hands and feet have become numb
 hilaane par bhi nahin hill rahe hai
 She sat up in panic
 
 
 haanfati hui
 
 
 Touched yourself
 
 
 lite band thi
 But all the people were in half sleep
 
 
 use kuch bhi nahin samaj main aa rahaa tha
 She was unable to see anything of scary shadows
 
 
 lag rahaa tha
 
 
 Faint 
 
 aspasht shabd
 
 
 Choking sounds
 
 
 munh se nikal rahi thim
 
 
 She was grumbling
 
 
 ro rahi thi
 
 
 He was shaking hands and feet, banging
 
 
 
 "what happened
 
 
 kya ho gaya
 
 
 ? " Mother-father and sisters were shaking her
 
 
 pani ke chhiten markar jagaa rahe the
 
 
 What happened to this? 
 
 ? kya hoga
 
 
 The Mother by saying
 
 
 rone lagi
 
 
 Immediately called the doctor
 
 
 aadhi raat ko hi sidhe nursing home le gayi
 
 
 After examination, the doctor said that she is pregnant
 
 
 anchaaha anjaanaa
 
 
 The seed is in her womb
 
 
 bina der kiye usee samay
 
 
 He was getting D&C done
 
 
 vah aadhi soi aadhi jaagi hui-si thi
 Even among the conscious and subconscious, he felt that the carcass of flesh sticking out of his internal organs was being pulled out
 
 
 or kai-kai aujaar
 
 
 In it
 
 
 chal rahe hai
 
 
 The difference was that this time
 
 
 uskaa
 
 
 That part was numb
 jab uski aankh khuli to saamne dow
 Shobha was sitting
 “kisi ho?” paas aakar unhone maathaa sahalaakar poocha
 "i'm fine auntie, what happened to me?" "what will you know? But now you should handle yourself
 bahut ho gaya
 Look at me what do i do Many times there are cases in which life or death
 
 
 yaa maan or bacchon main se kisi ek ko chunanaa hota he
 
 
 Have to save
 
 
 lekin aakhri kshan tak koshish karte hai
 So what is important, life
 
 
 sari jaddojahad jindagi ke liye hoti he na
 You have to think how much your own life is worth to you
 pehle tum swayan ke bare main socho ki tumhen deh ko lekar
 
 
 Have to keep on tormenting or walking on the voice of the soul
 
 
 baar-baar tumhaare saath ghatnaayen ghatit ho rahi hai or tum swayan kuch nahin kar paati ho
 Is this body yours or someone else's
 yadi tum meri beti hoti to main tumhen kahati utho-utho
 
 
 Wake up 
 
 jivan
 
 
 Let go at your own pace
 
 
 jo hua uskaa saamana karo
 Nobody accepts you, don't let me do it, you accept yourself
 
 
 
 Having said that, he told the whole thing and situation of the night
 ve usase koi bhi baat chupaana nahin chaahati thim
 “the whole truth is before you
 tumhaare saath he
 He was not shocked at hearing it
 aashcharya yaa du:kha bhi nahin hua
 
 
 She kept watching his face silently
 tajjub ki donon baar ghatit ghatnaon main sirf uski deh thi
 Were the components
 
 
 man nahin, aatma nahin
 "auntie, i don't want to be defeated
 meraa swabhaav vaisaa nahin he, main aatmaglani main ghul-ghulkar jeena bhi nahin chaahati
 i want to overcome all these situations, that fear
 
 
 jo chaaron taraf buna ja chukaa he
 
 
 Family members will also have to explain
 ” aaj pehali baar vah khulkar baat kar rahi thi
 From the deep bottom of events, she was now splurging to come up
 “agar doctor sharir ke ang main faile jehar ko ye sochakar na kaate ki us haath yaa paanv ke na rahane se uskaa sharir badsoorat ho jayega, aapng ho jayega to jehar to failega hi, magar main phir kahoongi ki us badsoorti yaa aapangata se mahatvapurn he jindagi
 
 
 Life 
 
 samajhi
 So you have to decide for yourself
 ” dow
 Shobha said firmly
 ghar lautate hue uskaa man ajeeb-si bechaini se ghira tha
 She wanted to throw away the stifling atmosphere around her
 
 
 sabase pehle usne apni almaari jamaai, kitaaben sajaayin, yadhyapi uskaa man swayan se lard rahaa tha
 She was fully prepared to fight a long battle
 
 
 kuch karnaa he
 
 
 some
 
 
 karke dikhaanaa he
 
 
 Everyone has to face it
 
 
 jaise vaakya uski soch, uske man ko nirantar urja de rahe the
 To reach the forefront of a child's unique aspiration
 
 
 mummy, papa, bhaiya tathaa didi ko aashcharya ho rahaa tha ki aakhir use ho kya gaya he
 
 
 The Has she been mentally broken? 
 
 achaanak hi aisa badlaav kaise aa gaya?“didi, meri marksheet bataanaa
 Will you go to college with me? ”looking at the marksheet
 
 
 vah musakara di
 He touched the marksheet as if touching something precious
 us ghatana ke baad aaj usne sabake bich baithkar baat kii thi
 The other day she stood in a tracking suit
 sharir se kamjor, magar man se swasth hokar
 "where are you going? Will you come out? Is your mind alright? "" Till the stadium
 ” usne ekadam shant tathaa sanyat awaz main kaha
 "what would everyone say if the doctor refused and would leave? Will ask then
 tumhen dekhakar sab yaad aa jayega
 By now the matter must have been suppressed
 ” buree tarah se ghabadai maan uske saamne
 
 
 Steep was questioning
 
 
 unka vyavhaar ekadam badal gaya tha
 She was suspicious
 kuch-kuch sakht bhi
 "I have not committed any mistake or crime, for which i should be engrossed in my whole life
 mummy
 i will face every situation whether or not anyone supports me
 ” kahkar vah bina ruke, bina kuch samajhe-samajhaaye scooter uthaakar chal di
 
 
 He felt that the sky is very clear and bright today
 jaani-pahachaani sadak par scooter chalaate hue uskaa man hawa se baaten karne laga

 The discord that started in the NDA over the seat sharing for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Bihar is not being named
 bijepi ke netritv vaale endie main sahyogi dalon ke bich shah-maat kaa khel jari he
 Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP where he is meeting leaders of opposition to pressurize BJP
 vahiin, jediu kaa saath milane ke baad bijepi kushvaha ko bahut zyada tavajjo dene ke mood main najar nahin aa rahi he
 RLSP President Upendra Kushwaha had demanded four seats from BJP high command Amit Shah, which the BJP leadership has categorically denied
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi upendra kushvaha ko do siten dene par raji he, lekin is par wo sahamat najar nahin aa rahe hai
 According to sources, how many seats and NDA allies will contest in Bihar, it may be announced next week
 mana ja rahaa he ki upendra kushvaha kii party ko is ghoshnaa se baahar rakhaa jayega, is tarah se upendra kushvaha kii party araspi kaa endie se baahar janaa lagbhag tay ho gaya he
 If sources are to be believed, the equation of seats will be as follows
 bihar kii 40 main se 18 siton par bijepi or 17 siton par jediu chunaav ladegi
 LJP will be given 5 Lok Sabha seats
 iske alaava kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko assam kii rajyasabha seat se sansad bheja jayega
 JDU had cleared the BJP leadership at the time of the alliance, their alliance is with BJP and Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP

 While Upendra Kushwaha's party was not included in Nitish Kumar's NDA government in Bihar
 isse nitish kumaar ne kushvaha ko lekar jediu kii raay saafe kar di thi
 Let me tell you that Chirag Paswan met Nitish Kumar and BJP general secretary and in-charge of Bihar BJP Bhupendra Yadav on Thursday three days ago about the seat sharing and discussed seat sharing
 idhar nitish kumaar ke khilaaf upendra kushvaha kii bayaanbaji se jediu khafa he

 haalanki kushvaha bhi raajnneetik chaal lagaataar chal rahe hai
 Recently i met RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and recently he met JDU rebel leader Sharad Yadav
 ise unhone nijee mulaakaat bataaya tha
 Kushwaha's meeting with opposition leaders is not appealing to BJP and JDU
 itnaa hi nahin kushvaha ne kaha tha ki yaduwanshi kaa doodh or kushavanshi kaa chaaval mil jaae to uttam kheer ban sakati he
 Let us tell you that Kushwaha contested in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections by staying in the bjp-led NDA in Bihar
 unhen teen siten mili thi or teenon siton par jeet mili thi
 However, one of his mps has left him
 iske alaava bihar main donon vidhayak bhi jediu main shaamil hone kii khabaren aa rahi hai

 Our ancestors were not illegal
 No person shld be called illegal immigrant
 B'deshi ppl who illegally enter India, their acts are illegal based on Indian law, but they are not 'illegal'
 Early humans moved from Africa to Asia for a better life
 Since then humans hv been moving
 Our human ancestors were not illegal
 - taslima nasreen (@taslimanasreen) August 1, 2018 After commenting on the nrc's list of politics between the sides and the opposition in the country, Taslima tweeted that there are many Muslims in India

 But the problem is, Indian politicians need them
 - taslima nasreen (@taslimanasreen) August 1, 2018 It is noteworthy that while attacking West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Taslima tweeted Mangwar that 'it was nice to see that Mamta Banerjee is so much for 40 lakh Bengali speakers Is more sympathetic
 unhone yahaan tak kah diya he ki vah assam baahar kiye jane vaale logon ko vah sharan dengi
 Where was his sympathy when his rival party drove me out of West Bengal 'good to see Mamtaji is so sympathetic to 40 lakh Bengali speaking people
 She even says West Bengal will shelter those people left out of Assam
 How come she doesn't have any sympathy for me who was thrown out of Bengal by her rival party? - taslima nasreen (@taslimanasreen) July 31, 2018 Taslima further tweeted that 'all homeless Bengali speakers inside Mamta k is not sympathetic to K
 yadi unke andar hota to unke andar mere liye bhi hoti or unhone mujhe bhi pashchim bengal main aane kii anumati di hoti
 Mamtaji does not have sympathy for all rootless or homeless Bengali speaking people

 The situation is that when the Modi government is completing its four years, the country has seen four defense ministers and five information and broadcasting ministers
 At the time of the formation of the government, on May 26, 2014, Prakash Javadekar was made the Minister of State (independent Charge) for Information and Broadcasting
 
 lekin kuch hi maheenon ke baad 9 november, 2014 ko hue pherbadal main unhen yahaan se hataa diya gaya
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was given the additional charge of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 9 November 2014, replacing Javadekar
 haalanki unke paas bhi is mantralay kaa prabhaar 5 july, 2016 tak hi rahaa
 On 5 July 2016, the charge of this ministry was handed over to senior BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu
 vah is pad par kareeb ek saal 17 july, 2017 tak rahe, kyonki unhen bharat ke up raashtrapati pad ke liye bijepi ne ummidavaar bana diya
 Smriti Irani's tenure was followed by Smriti Irani, the high-profile minister of the Modi government
 unhone 18 july, 2017 ko mantralay kaa prabhaar sambhala
 But she too could not stay in this post for long
 14 may, 2018 ko phir ek pherbadal main smriti irani se yah mantralay chin liya gaya
 In his place Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore was made the Minister of Information and Broadcasting (independent charge)
 smriti irani se soochna evam prasaaran jaisaa mahatvapurn vibhaag kyon chhina gaya, isko lekar tamaam khabaren saamne ain
 Ban proposal on journalists for fake news, ruckus on Padmavati's release, not showing two films at IFFI, replacing Censor Board President, removing condom ads from TV during day time, President during distribution of Film Awards Being present for a limited period are some of the issues that have kept this ministry in the limelight
 raksha mantralay main bhi lagaataar pherbadalsarkaar gathan ke samay 26 may, 2014 ko arun jetali ko desh kaa pehla raksha mantri banaaya gaya
 However, he was able to remain in this post for a few months
 pherbadal main unhen 9 november, 2014 ko is mantralay se hataa diya gaya
 In his place, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar was appointed as the new Defense Minister of the country
 manohar parrikar kaa kaarykaal thodaa lanbaa jarur rahaa, lekin 13 march, 2017 ko unhone istipha de diya, kyonki unka naam phir se goa ke mukhyamantri pad ke liye tay ho gaya tha
 During his tenure, on September 28-29, 2016, a surgical strike was carried out by brave soldiers of the Indian Army across the loc
 yah mantralay phir ek baar arun jetali ko saunpa gaya
 But Arun Jaitley had additional charge of this
 isliye is pad par kisi purnakalik raksha mantri ko laayaa janaa jaruri tha
 However, it was during Jaitley's tenure that the government implemented its long-pending One Rank One pension, keeping its promise
 3 sitambar, 2017 ko nirmala sitaraman ko desh kaa nayaa raksha mantri banaaya gaya
 This is the second time a woman has been given the Ministry of Defense
 iske pehle indira gandhi piem rahete hue raksha mantri rah chuki thim
 PM Modi was happy with the work of JNU student Nirmala Sitharaman in the Ministry of Commerce, so she was promoted to cabinet minister of an important department

 Kriti realized the power of counseling while counseling a rape victim
 ek bacchee ke doctor pita ne uske paidaa hone se pehle hi maa ko tyaag diya tha
 Relatives wanted the mother to give birth, but in the seventh month of pregnancy, Kriti, born in an unknown place in Gujarat, grew up in Bhilwara, where her mother worked in a government job
 unke parivaar ne kriti ko kabhi sweekaara hi nahin or unhen andeh he ki unhen dhimaa jehar diya gaya tha kyonki jab ve 10 varsh kii thim tab unka sharir ekadam sust ho gaya tha or unhen lakva bhi maar gaya tha

 The water of the Brahmaputra has turned red with blood, but Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi's dilemma continues
 20 july ko bodo or muslim pravaasiyon ke bich khooni takaraav ke baad 4,00,000 visthapit log bodoland kshetreey swaitshasi jila (beatiedi) ke vibhinn kshetron main chalane vaale 278 raahat shiviron main bhar gaye
 On August 1, Gogoi announced that his government would send refugees back to their homes by Independence Day
 lekin 7 agast ko unka man badal gaya
 He said, "I did not say that i will send people back by August 15
" mere kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki punarvaas prakriya 15 agast se shuru ho jaaegi
 "from this U-turn one can understand how ignorant Gogoi is from the incident in which 78 people have lost their lives and about which he himself said on August 7," Assam is like a volcano, it Can burst anytime
 aisi chijen (sampradayik hinsa) hoti rahengi, aisa pehle bhi ho chukaa he or aage bhi ho saktaa he
 "such a statement of the head of a government cannot be called satisfactory
" assam gana parishad ke adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri prafull kumaar mahant kehete hai, ''yadi aisi chijen hoti rahengi or sarkaar ise niyantrit nahin kar sakati to phir sarkaar kii bhoomika hi kya he? hamen mukhyamantri se aise aparipakv bayaan kii ummid nahin thi
 "gogoi is looking satisfied only after announcing the CBI probe into the violence
" 26 july kii hinsa ke baad kuch din kii shanti rahi lekin 5 or 7 agast ko kokarajhaar or chirang main nau logon kii hatya kar di gai
 Gogoi claims that 170 people allegedly involved in the riots have been arrested
 chirang jile ke bhauragudi kaa saat saal kaa muslim baccha abhi tak apane 55 varsh ke pita or 18 varsh ke bhai kii maut ke sadame se ubar nahin paaya he
 The house of the family was burnt down on 23 April, after which the whole family was staying in the relief camp at Bhoraguri
 5 agast ko ye teenon chupake se shivi se baahar chale gaye taaki kajalgaanv ke saptahik bazaar main gaayon kii bikri main dallali kar kuch aamadani kar saken
 Here they were surrounded by about 25 tribal youths and cut off the child's father and brother
 baccha kisi tarah jaan bachaakar bhaaga or raahat shivi main laut aayaa
 He and his 37-year-old mother are now afraid to return to the village
 hamalavar aise hi dar kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahate hai
 Even the Bodo people are not willing to leave the camp by the date fixed by Gogoi for fear of revenge
 kokarajhaar jile ke gosigaanv ke ek raahat shivi main rah rahe van vibhaag ke karmchaaree 34 varshiya pranjit mushahara kehete hai, ''ham yahaan kam se kam id ke paanch din baad tak intjaar karnaa chaahate hai
 We will not leave the camp
 ''raahat shiviron main rahane vaale sharnaarthi apane ghar lautne ko taiyaar nahin hai, to duusari taraf , bodoland kshetreey parishad (beatisi) ne maang kii he ki beatiedi kshetron main punarvaas se pehle vahaan basaae jane vaale logon ke parichay-patr aadi kii jaanch honi chahie
 The BTC suspects that all the people living in the relief camps are displaced from the BTAD region during the ethnic conflict
 vah chaahati he ki punarvaas kii prakriya charanbaddh tareeke se shuru kii jaae
 BTC Deputy Chief Khampa Borogyari says that the council has passed a resolution that in the first phase, those who have any land in the BTAD area should be immediately rehabilitated
 jin logon ke paas jameen nahin he, lekin matadaata suchi main naam he, unhen tab tak raahat shiviron main rakhaa janaa chahie jab tak beatisi or sarkaar unki takadir kaa faisla karne ke liye kisi samjhaute par nahin pahunch jate
 Borogyari claimed 'illegal migrants' could take advantage of this situation and infiltrate the BTAD area
 ve kehete hai, ''2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik kokarajhaar jile kii jansankhya kareeb 10
 3 lakhs and 2 in it
 3 lakh musalmaan hai
 But around 4,50,000 people are staying in relief camps in Kokrajhar and Dhubri district
 kokarajhaar kii muslim jansankhya kaa aadhe se bhi kam hissaa jhadpon se prabhavit hua he
 It is very difficult to believe that the population of Muslims has increased so fast in a year
 ''gogoi bhi is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki raahat shiviron main rah rahe logon main prabhavit ilaakon se itar baahar ke log bhi ho sakate hai
 He said, "we have told the BTC leadership that there should be no place for any illegal migrant in the BTAD area
" keval adhikrut jameen maalikon ko hi beatiedi main rahane kii ijaajat di jaaegi
 We have a record and we will work on that basis
 ''mukhyamantri kaa daawa he ki raahat shiviron kii sankhya 278 se ghatakar 242 ho gai he, or kareeb 1,16,000 log apane gharon ko laut aae hai
 But there are still 3,50,960 people living in the camps
 buree khabar yah he ki shivi chhodkar apane gaanv waapas gaye logon ke jhund ke jhund kokarajhaar or chirang main nae sire se hui hinsa ke baad phir se shiviron main aane lage hai
 The second match of the three-match T20 series between Team India and England will be played tonight at 10:00 pm at the Sofia Gardens ground in Cardiff
 pehle tii-20 match main jeet hasil karne ke baad bhartiya team kii nazren aaj duusare match main england ko maat dete hue teen tii-20 maichon kii siries main 2-0 kii ajey badhat lene par hogi
 If India reiterates the way they performed in the last match, then the return of England will cool down
 england ke liye kisi bhi tarah se vaapasi aasaan nahin rahane vaali he
 The biggest obstacle in his path is the pairing of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal
 kuldeep ne paanch wicket apane naam kiye the
 Although Chahal could not take wickets, but he has the ability to take wickets and stop runs
 yah jodi england ke ballebaajon ke liye puri siries main pareshaani kaa sabab hogi
 The England camp is using the spin bowling machine 'merlin' for practice as it does not have wrist spin bowlers for practice
 team india lagaaegi tii-20 siries jeet kaa chhakkabhartiya team tii-20 cricket main lagaataar chhathi siries jeetne kii dahalij par he
 The sequence was started in November 2017 with a home series win over New Zealand
 uske baad se bharat ne ek bhi tii-20 siries nahin ganvaai he
 If India have a chance to improve their T20 rankings, if India wins the series 2–0, the difference will be narrowed to second-placed Australia in the ICC rankings, while winning 3–0 will move them to second place after Pakistan
 duusari ore bharat ko aisa karne se rokane ke liye australia ko zimbabwe main chal rahi maujuuda tri siries ke agle do maichon main jeet darj kerani hogi
 On the other hand, if England loses, it will come in seventh place after New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies
 england ne pichley 10 tii-20 maichon main se paanch hi jite hai
 IND vs ENG: Watch the second T20 today, when and where LIVE streaming team indiateam India has captain Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Hardik Pandya apart from Rahul
 pichley match main bharat ke tej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar prabhavi nahin rahe the
 His share wicket did not come either
 is match main bhubaneshwar apana khaataa kholana chahenge
 Apart from them, fast bowling will take on Umesh Yadav and Pandya
 ek match ke baad bhartiya team prabandhan badlaav karne ke mood main nahin hoga
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar can be retained in the team despite proving costly
 england ke sheershakram ne tej akraman ko bakhubi jhela tha jo bharat ke liye chintaa kaa sabab he
 Both Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar had failed in Old Tafford
 englandengland kii baat kii jaae to pichley match main jose butler ke alaava koi khaasaa prabhaav nahin chhod sakaa tha
 Apart from Butler, the hosts have Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Johnny Bairstow, captain Eoin Morgan T20 legends
 in sabhi ke upar kuldeep, chahal se nipatane kaa jimmaa hoga
 In bowling, Liam Plunkett, David Wiley will have to return
 vahiin spin vibhaag main moin ali or adil rashid ko badi bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 For England, however, the problem does not end here
 bharat kii ballebaaji uske liye doosraa chintaa kaa sabab he
 In Manchester, Lokesh Rahul had hoisted the English bowlers fiercely
 vah shandaar form main hai or is match main bhi england ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Teams: India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Lokesh Rahul, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Dinesh Karthik, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Suresh Raina, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Deepak Chahar, Siddharth Kaul, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav

 @bombaysunshine and me we both still don't feel like parents or "mom" & "dad" in the making
 
 
 
 We have always felt that parents only mean our respective mum n dad😋😋😋 now there will be a new entity calling us that
 
 
 completely unfathomable so far
 But we are ready and with the grace of God we will humbly receive the gift he gives us🙏

" ' (also from input language) melbern test ke drow hote hi border-gavaskar trophy mezbaan australia ke naam ho gai
 Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to retire made this Test memorable forever, but before leaving, captain Dhoni pointed out a lack of team that without fixing Team India difficult to win even further Will continue to happen melbern test ke paanchaven din team india australia ke do wicket hasil kar pai, wo bhi kaafii der se or mushkil se
 According to former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar he had little hope that the Indian bowlers would be able to take 20 wickets to help Team India win the match, while former captain MS Dhoni admits that Team India lacks an all-rounder due to which gendbaazon par boj bad gaya he
 Shortly after the Melbourne Test, Mahi stated clearly that he is very happy with the current bowlers of the team
 unhone acchhee gend daali, lekin team main olerounder kii kami kii vajah se in gendbaazon par boj bad gaya
 Clearly, the team to which Mahi is pointing out, there is hardly any refusal to accept it
 kyonki is kami kaa kaamiyaaza team ne kai baar bhugta he
 It is to be noted that in the current series, the Indian team could not get out of the Australian team four times out of six, that is, the Australian team failed to take 20 wickets
 yahi nahin australia ne teenon test main ek baar 500 se bada score khadaa kiya
 In these three Tests, Australian batsmen have played six centuries and 11 fifties
 matlab saafe he ki agar team india ko sidney test main gendbaaz apana damaum dikhaa paaen iske liye unhen 20 wicket lekar aalochakon ko galat sabit karne kii zarurat hogi
 How the new captain Virat Kohli will be able to do this in the current situation is going to prove very big for him as well

 Addressing Manoj Tiwari, Kejriwal said, "who are you, is your father's Delhi?" During a public meeting in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal said that Chief Ministers staged sit-ins in Gujarat, Andhra and Bihar, making these states also half two
 isse aage unhone manoj tiwari ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'tum hote koun ho dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene vaale
 Is your father's Delhi? Who is Manoj Tiwari, who will give full state to Delhi? ' Kejriwal also said that Manoj Tiwari's father had not staged a sit-in
 bataa den ki haal hi main manoj tiwari ne kaha tha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya janaa chahie, kyonki aisa hone se desh ke sangheey dhaanche ke liye khatra sabit ho saktaa he
 Kejriwal told Shah that Gundakejriwal tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah on Wednesday by tweeting
 unhone likhaa, 'aaj subah hamaare do kol centre par amit shah ne dilli police kin red karai
 Now the owners of all call centers are being threatened by the police station
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aam aadmi party kaa kaam band kar do

 In this process, the call center which was hired to get votes is being grieved daily
 amit shah rojaanaa dilli police ko gunde kii tarah istemaal kar rahe hai
 Sisodia further said that why the arrest of the owner of the call center was made by the Aam Aadmi Party
 himmat he to aam aadmi party ko karen giraftaar
 The owner of the call center is being pressured not to work for the Aam Aadmi Party
 amit shah ke gunde kii tarah kaam na karo
 If we go to whose house Amit Shah got his votes, then arrest the Aam Aadmi Party
 sisodiya ne kaha ki dilli police aukaat main rahe or bijepi kaa gunda na bane

 Apart from this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also promised to make Delhi a full state on winning seven seats in his statements

 bjp's manifesto Jalayadilai Vajpayee and Madanlal Khurana's Yadarwind Kejriwal also referred to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former Delhi Chief Minister Madanlal Khurana (both BJP leaders have passed away)
 unhone kaha, 'madanlaal khurana ji kii aatma aasmaan se dekh rahi hogi to aansu baha rahi hogi ki aaj unka betaa (harish khurana) is tarah se apane baap ke saath gaddari kar rahaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal did not stop here and he also gave the example of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unhone kaha, 'vaajapeyi ji dilli ko purna rajya banane ke liye sansad main bill laae the
 Narendra Modi ji, if you really respect Vajpayee ji, then show this by making Delhi a full state, otherwise stop doing politics with his ashes
 'apane bayaan ke aakhir main kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaakar rahenge
 Even if my life is lost to get Delhi its right, there is a spot
 yah andolan he or jab tak purna rajya kaa darja dilli ko nahin mil jaataa yah andolan jari rahegaa

 bhartiya cricket team ke liye saal 2016 behad khaas rahaa
 While the record for 18 consecutive Test matches remained undefeated, one after the other five Test series made a name, and also created a new record of winning the most Test matches in a calendar year
 haalanki isi dauraan lodha cameti kii siforeeshon ko lagu nahin kar paane kii vajah se bisisiai kii kirakiri bhi hui to australia main vanade siries or apni dharti par isisi world tii20 toornament ke final main nahin pahunch paane kaa jhatka bhi laga
 Virat Kohli, the Test captain of Team indiateam India, who was invincible in 2016, also says that the year was good for Indian cricket, except for the failure of World T20 and Australian soil
 cricket ko pratispardhaa ke nai oonchai par le jane vaale kohli kaa yah kahana bharat ke cricket main pradarshan kii kahani bayaan karata he
 This year, Team India played 12 Test matches and set the record for the most nine wins in a calendar year, becoming the only team this year that did not lose a single match in this format
 viraat ne saal 2010 main mili aath jeet ke record ko peeche choda
 Bench strength performance with triple century is a cricket team game, so the contribution of each player leads to victory in the match but captain Virat Kohli and all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin were the biggest heroes of this year
 inke saath hi cheteshwar pujaara, murali vijay, ravindra jadeja, ajinkya rahane or saal ke antim test main tihara shatak laga kar karun nair ne bhi surkhiyaan batorin
 India became a 'virat' under Kohli's captaincy: Virat Kohli became the captain of Team India after Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from Test cricket at the end of 2014 and since then he has been taking the team to new heights
 saal 2016 main test siries kii shuruyaat westeindies daure se hui or team india ne vahaan 2-0 se jeet darj kii
 After this, New Zealand were beaten 3–0 at their home grounds and then ended the year by winning the 5 Test series against England by a historic margin of 4–0
 jin nau test maichon main bharat ko jeet mili unhen team india ne teen pari ke antar se, teen 200 ran se adhik ke antar se, do test 150 ran se adhik ke antar se or ek test aath wicket ke bade antar se jiti or ek baar phir test kii world ranking main pakistan se number-1 kaa taj chhina
 Kohli's Team India is at the same position today as it was a few years ago
 test ranking main bharat 120 ankon ke saath number do par khadey australia (105 ank) se bade antar se aage he
 Virat Kohli has captained 22 Tests so far in the year 2016
 inamen se unhone 14 main bharat ko jeet dilaai he jabaki keval do main haar
 This year he played 75 out of 12 Test matches
 93 kii ausat se 1215 ran bhi banaae or jab jab jarurat padi to diwaar kii tarah khadey hokar team ko sankat se ubaara
 Virat also scored double centuries this year against all of the West Indies, New Zealand and England
 kohli kii majboot ballebaaji kii baangi cricket ke teenon hi formet main dekhne ko mili
 Currently, Kohli is second in Tests and odis in the ICC World Rankings and first in T20 batsmen
 kohli se kandhaa milakar khadey hai asvintest maichon main bharat kii safalataa kii kahani main jitna ahm role captain kohli kaa he usase kam ravichandran aswin kaa nahin
 Ashwin performed extremely commendably this year not only with the ball but also with the bat
 unhone 2016 main khele gaye 12 test maichon main 23
 While taking 72 wickets at an average of 90, 43
 72 kii ausat or do shatakon kii madad se 612 ran bhi jade
 Ravindra Jadeja also gave an unforgettable performance along with Ashwin
 unhone pich par duusare chor se aswin kaa puraa saath diya or khele gaye 9 maichon main 43 ballebaajon ko pavilion bheja
 With seven wickets in the second innings of the final Test against England and 10 wickets in the match, Jadeja rose to exactly number-2 in the ICC bowling rankings after Ashwin (number-1)
 aswin ko unke shandaar pradarshan ke liye isisi ne test cricketer of da year chunaa
 He became the third Indian cricketer to win the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy after Rahul Dravid (2004) and Sachin Tendulkar (2010)
 ekadivasiy main ausat pradarshnavanade main team india, 900waan vanade khilne vaali pehali team baniin
 India won this match against New Zealand in Dharamsala by six wickets, but in the very next match, New Zealand defeated the Indian team at Kotla, which was also India's 400th defeat in odis
 saal 2016 main khele gaye 13 vanade muqablon main team ko saat main jeet to chah main haar mili
 After four consecutive defeats on Australian soil, they won the final ODI, then defeated Zimbabwe 3–0 and New Zealand 3–2 in the middle of the year
 asia cap main jeet, world tii20 main haarais saal khele gaye 21 tii20 muqablon main se 15 jeetne or keval paanch haarane ke baavjood pradarshan vaisaa nahin rahaa jaisaa test formet main kohli kii captaini main tha kyonki world tii20 par apni hi pichon par jab team ko jeet kii jarurat thi tab naakaami mili
 The year started with a 3–0 win on Australian soil, then lost the series 2–1 after losing the first match on their own soil to the Sri Lankan youth team and won the Asia Cup tournament without losing a single match
 iske baad world tii20 ke pehle hi match main newjiland ke khilaaf keval 79 ranon par out hokar haar ke saath is toornament kii shuruyaat kii
 After this, West Indies showed their way to the semi-finals after defeating arch-rivals Pakistan (for the second time this year after the Asia Cup), Bangladesh and Australia
 carabian team hi is toornament kii champion bhi bani
 Virat Kohli, who scored 273 runs in five matches, was adjudged Man of the Tournament
 iske baad bharat ne zimbabwe ko tii20 siries 2-1 se jarur haraaya lekin america main westeindies se wo world tii20 kaa badla chukaane main naakaam rahi
 Here the first match was won by the West Indies while the second match was canceled
 hyderabad bani ipel-2016 kii championcricket kii baat ipel kii charchaa ke bagaiyr adhuri rahati he or is saal to viraat kohli ne yahaan bhi apni ballebaaji se records kii jhadi laga di
 Kohli scored a record 973 runs in 16 matches in this tournament but his team lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final and with this Kohli's dream of making his team Royal Challengers Bangalore the IPL champions could not be fulfilled
 gharelu cricket main mumbai championgharelu cricket main ek baar phir mumbai kaa sikaa chalaa or wo 41veen baar ranjai trophy jitkar rashtriya champion bana
 Mumbai defeated Saurashtra by a margin of one innings and 21 runs in the final played in February

 He then held the office of Chief Minister of Karnataka and is now in the fray to win BJP from hubli-dharwad Central seat
 is seat ko unki paramparaagat seat mana jaataa he, yahaan se 5 baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 Born in December 1955, Shettar was the 21st Chief Minister of Karnataka from 2012 to 2013

 Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was in US custody for some time before he was killed
 ahmedinejad ne irani sarkari tivi par kaha, mere paas pakki soochna he ki jis din laden maaraa gaya usase kuch pehle vah america sena dwaara kaid kar liya gaya tha
 He said, please pay attention to what i said

 He said, the US President did what he did for domestic political gains
 duusare shabdon main, unhone obama ke chunaav (phir se raashtrapati nirvaachit hone) ke liye use maar daalaa
 Two days after Osama was killed on May 2 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Iranian Defense Minister Ahmed Waheedi also expressed suspicion over Laden's death
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sheersh padaadhikariyon kii teen divasiy ek mahatvapurn baithak gujarat ke somnath main mangalvaar se shuru ho rahi he
 All the RSS pracharaks are participating in this
 isamen prachaarkon ko nae kaary saunpane, sanghathan ke kaamkaaj aadi par vichaar kiya jayega

 ise dekhte hue sangh ne yah nirnay liya he ki sanghathan ko har jile ke har tehsil tak pahunchaaya jayega or shatabdi varsh manaane ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di jaaengi
 In order to facilitate its functioning, the Sangh has divided the entire country into 43 provinces
 is baithak main RSS ke sabhi 43 praant prachaarkon ke alaava uske rashtriya str ke kai padaadhikari bhi shaamil honge
 For example, UP is divided into seven and Maharashtra is divided into four provinces
 sangh philhal upi, empi aurkerala ke sabhitahseelon tak apni pahunch bana chukaa he
 This meeting of Somnath is important in the sense that there are only a few days left for the Lok Sabha elections
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki is baar bijepi ko phir se satta main laane ke liye aresas ke kaaryakarta chunaav prachaar main jor-shor se lagenge
 Top leaders of the RSS and BJP have also started reviewing the functioning of all the mps

 Youth is the beat of this country and in the current Lok Sabha elections, only the younger generation will determine the direction of votes in the country
 raajnneetik partiyaan yuvaaon ke vot to hasil karnaa chaahati hai, lekin ve yuva netaaon ko chunaav main utaarne se kataraati hai
 India Today's data intelligence unit found in its investigation that all parties are far behind in leading the youth
 chaahe ve sipiai ke kanhaiya hon yaa bhaajapa ke tejasvi surya, is chunaav main yuva netaaon kii awaz kaaphi had tak sunne ko mili he
 But the India Today Data Intelligence Unit found that youth representation in politics is very modest
 is tathy tak pahunchane ke liye hamane 2019 loksabhaa chunaav lard rahe sabhi ummidavaaron kii umr ko teen shreniyon main baanta- 25-40 (yuva) 40-60 (madhyam umr ) or 60 se upar (vruddh)
 The data showed that only 33 percent of the candidates were young, ie below 40 years of age
 lagbhag aadhe ummidavaar (48%) 40-60 varsh kii shrenee main aae or vruddh logon kaa aankada lagbhag 19% tha
 Average age The average age of India in 2018 was stated to be 28 years
 data intelligence unit ne paaya ki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav lard rahi partiyon main kisi bhi badi party kii ausat umr rashtriya ausat ke aas paas nahin he
 The average age of all the contesting candidates is 46 years
 yani ummidavaaron kii umr kaa ausat rashtriya ausat se 18 varsh zyaada he
 This means that half of the candidates contesting this time are over 46 years old and half are under 46 years old
 badi kshetreey or rashtriya partiyon main keval ek hi party is aankade se neeche thi
 The average income of the total candidates of Shiv Sena is 44 years
 vah hamaare aankalan main sabase yuva party ke rup main saamne ai
 Shiv Sena is the only major party whose average age is less than the average age of the total candidates
 andhra pradesh kii wiesar party ek maatr aisi party nikali jisaki ausat umr kul ummidavaaron kii umr ke baraabar yani 46 saal rahi
 The average age of Telugu Desam Party, All India Anna DMK, Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party is 47 years
 57 varsh kii ausat umr ke saath jad(you) hamaare aankalan main sabase zyaada vruddh pai gai
 The average age of candidates of Congress Party and BJP were also 56 and 55 years respectively
 basapa ke ummidavaaron kii umr 53 saal rahi
 The large average age of these big parties clearly shows that they did not give opportunity to the youth to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 sabase yuva party koun?sabase yuva party koun?40 saal se kam umr ke 45
 With 3% young candidates, the Shiv Sena has given the maximum number of youth to contest elections
 shivasena ke baad aati he basapa or aam aadmi party
 29% candidates of both these parties are youth
 uske baad aati he trinmul congress jiske 26% ummidavaar yuva hai
 DMK of Tamil Nadu does not have any candidate whose age is below 40 years
 sabase kharaab pradarshan karne vaali partiyon main dramuk ke baad aati he bijepi
 Only 8% of the BJP candidates are under 40 years of age
 congress party kaa bhi pradarshan kuch zyaada acha nahin tha
 Congress also gave election tickets to only 12% of the youth
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki lagbhag sabhi badi partiyon ke paas chaatr yuva ikaiyaan maujuud hai, lekin uske baavjood yuvaaon ko raajnneeti main jagah nahin mil rahi
 Who is the oldest party? Telugu Desam Party has proved to be the oldest party by dropping 52% candidates over the age of sixty
 tidipi ke baad aati he jad(you) jahaan 42% ummidavaar vruddh hai
 39% of Trinamool Congress candidates are above the age of sixty
 hairaani kii baat yah ki bhaajapa or congress ke vruddh ummidavaaron kii sankhya unke yuva ummidavaaron se teen guna zyaada he
 While 32% of BJP candidates are aged, 38% of Congress candidates are aged
 sabase vruddh ummidavaar tamilnadu kii madurai seat se chunaav lard rahe pi algar hai jinhen vahaan kii sthaneey party dasia makkal shakti katchhi kaa tikat mila he
 Who are the young candidates of the parties? According to the rules, it is necessary to be 25 years old to contest elections
 diaiu ne aise 65 ummidavaar paae jinaki umr 25 varsh he
 Among the larger parties, two BSP candidates are aged 25, Gitanjali Singh, from Durg (chhattisgarh) and Nikhil from Thrissur in Kerala
 shivasena or trinmul congress ke paas bhi ek-ek ummidavaar hai jinaki umr 25 varsh he
 25-year-old Rinku Sahni is contesting from Bahraich (uttar Pradesh) on Shiv Sena ticket, while 25-year-old Rupali Biswas of Trinamool Congress is contesting from Ranaghat (west Bengal)

 bade rajyon main telugana ke ummidavaar sabase yuva hai
 45 percent of Telangana candidates are young
 jharkhand ke 39 pratishat, haryana ke 36 pratishat or gujarat ke 38 pratishat ummidavaar yuva hai

 aapako shaayad yakeen na ho lekin lakdi kii kanghee se bal sanvaarane par bal kam jhadate hai or dendraf bhi nahin hota he
 Apart from this, the use of wooden comb also relieves headaches

 According to experts, the use of any other comb will cause hair to break in the middle or lose its shine, but with the use of a wood comb, neither the hair breaks in the middle nor does it lose its shine

 During combing, the wooden extract is given to the body through the scalp, which also gives relief in problems like headaches

 Returning officer Manish Faujdar said that Rakesh Jain, a voter who went to vote, said that when i went to vote with EVM machine, i saw that i was voting for someone and in VVPAT machine, someone was going to vote
 matdaan do ghante tak roak diya gaya
 Angry Congress workers also shouted slogans outside many polling stations

 The latter became operational, causing a lot of anger among voters

 Now Arun Jaitley has clarified many of its provisions by tweeting
 iskar kanoon main sanshodhan ke liye loksabhaa main karadhaan kanoon (doosraa sanshodhan) vidheyak 2016 somvaar ko pesh kiya gaya tha jise mangalvaar ko paarit kiya
 Now this bill will be introduced in Rajya Sabha

 iskar kii dhara 270 e ke tahat aay chupaane yaa uske bare main galat jaankaree dene par lagane vaali 200 fisadi kii penalty purvavat lagati rahegi
 2
 abhi tak aisi nakadi par sirf 30 fisadi tex lagata tha, jiske strot ke bare main vyakti koi jaankaree na de paata ho, lekin ab is par 60 fisadi tex, is tex ke 25 fisadi tak sarcharge or tex ke 3 fisadi tak ses ke rup main liya jayega

 New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram retired from Test cricket on Tuesday, but will continue to play ODI and Twenty20 cricket
 soch-vichaarkar kiya nirnayaoram ne kaha ki kaarybhaar kam hone se ve apane antarrashtriya karier ko vistaar de sakate hai
 He said, "I have decided to retire from Test cricket
 yah kathin tha, lekin maine kaaphi soch-samajhakar yah tay kiya he
 The 31-year-old Oram, who was suffering from a hamstring injury, did not play in the Champions Trophy as well

 More opportunities in instant cricket, he said, "the reason for continuing to play ODI and T20 cricket is that there are more opportunities to play in it
 newjiland team test cricket kam khelti he, lekin vishwa cap, tii-20 vishwa cap, champiens trophy or indian premier lig jaise toornamenton main khel ke laghu swaroop main khilne ke kaaphi maukey hai
 '' vakt jakhmon ko bhar detaa he, lekin afsos he ki aisa raajnneeti ke bajaae muhaavaron main hi hota he

 Suppose the Congress would have got 11 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in Assam if the UPA had preferred to conduct a general election in March this year or were forced to do so

 nellur main ek train haadase ne desh ko yah yaad dilaa diya he ki uske paas koi rail mantri nahin he, kam-se-kam aisa to nahin hi he, jo offis main baithe
 News was written all over the world about the power failure, but Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari did not see it, it created anger everywhere
 alag-alag hisson main chap rahi har khabar kaa ek hi masauda haih sarkaar thap ho chuki he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cannot escape by looking helpless
 unki ek samasya he jisaki ve saarvajanik taur par bilkul charchaa nahin kar sakate, lekin nishchit rup se apane drawing room kii privesi main ise sweekaar kar sakate hai: congress ke paas tallent kaa akaal pad gaya he
 He did not make Energy Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde the Home Minister on the day of the blackout because he has a very strong sense of humor
 unhone aisa isliye kiya kyonki unke paas or koi vikalp nahin tha
 Shinde is perhaps the only cabinet minister who has both the experience and maturity to work peacefully in this ministry 
 ek consteble se lekar desh ke policeblon ke kaaryakari pramukh tak kii unhone chupchaap lekin vilakshan yatra kii he
 It is shameful for the Finance and Home Minister to reiterate some other names which were in discussion in Delhi before handing over the portfolios to Chidambaram and Shinde
 kabhi aisa vakt bhi rahaa he ki congress ke paas aisi do cabinet banane ke laayak kai diggaj hua karte the
 But the Congress has gradually eroded its people so systematically that even its chief minister does not fit the needs of the Home Ministry
 ve iske liye sharad pavaar kii ore bhi dekh sakate the, lekin congress kii samskruti apane sahyogi dalon ko duusare darje kaa kaam dene kii rahi he
 The Congress had the best option
 urja mantralay rahul gandhi ke liye ekadam sahi vibhaag ho saktaa tha
 The failure of his predecessors certainly left him with a scope to show his administrative skills and strengthen his claim to the leadership of the country
 kisi ne rahul ko bargala diya he ki agar ve hakeekat main kuch karne ke bajaae jab-tab tivi camaron ke saamne kuch johar dikhaa denge to ve bharat ke pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 It is not easy to rule or become a part of India

 Poor administration has to pay a heavy price and its results start immediately

 You have to rule with both hands, think about the use of legs and work round the clock
 shashan ke myne logon ke liye kaam he, or pehali cheez ve yahi chaahate hai ki sarkaar un par puraa dhyaan de
 They then seek decisions, especially on matters related to life and death
 upie sarkaar kaa antim charan tab shuru hoga jab pradhanmantri manmohan singh asahaay se hataash ho jaaenge
 They probably have not made the move because they think that there is some hope left from their visit to Pakistan in late November

 '' bhartiya janata party ne dilli or bihar main netritv parivartan karne kaa nirnay liya he
 The party has now made singer and MP Manoj Tiwari the president of the state BJP after Satish Upadhyay in Delhi, while Nityananda Rai has been given the command of the party in Bihar
 ullekhneey he ki donon hi rajyon main party pramukhon kaa kaarykaal puraa ho chukaa tha or party ne nai niyukti nahin kii thi
 Leaders holding positions in both places have been doing the work uninterrupted
 ab party ne parivartan kaa nirnay liya he
 Let us know that the central unit of the party has been blaming Sushil Modi, Mangal Pandey and Nand Kishore Yadav for the party's defeat in Bihar
 inaki tikdi ko party ke sheersh netritv ne haar ke baad tavajjo nahin di
 Mangal Pandey is the president of Bihar BJP and now the party's signal is clear for him after the new announcement
 bataa den ki vidhayak dal ke netaa ke rup main party ne nand kishor yadav ko nahin chunaa
 There was speculation of Sushil Modi being sent to the Rajya Sabha
 lekin party netritv ne yah bhi nahin mana
 Gopal Narayan Singh was sent to the Rajya Sabha
 tippaniyan Nityananda Rai is a Yadav by caste and is a leader of a domineering image
 chaar baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeet chuke hai or abhi There is a Lok Sabha MP from Ujiarpur
 yah mana jaataa he ki susheel modi, nand kishor yadav or mangal pandey kii team ne bihar main haar ke baad saarvajanik rup se jimmevary na lekar ek tarah se haar kaa jimmaa narendra modi or amit shah par daal diya tha
 It is noteworthy that the tenure of the party chiefs in both the states was over and the party did not make a new appointment
 donon hi jagahon par pad sambhaal rahe netaa kaam yathaavat karte aa rahe hai
 Now the party has decided to change
 bataa den ki party kii kendriya ikai bihar main party kii haar ke liye susheel modi, mangal pandey or nand kishor yadav ko jimmedaar maanati rahi he
 His trio was not paid attention by the top leadership of the party after the defeat
 mangal pandey bihar bijepi ke adhyaksh hai or ab nai ghoshnaa ke baad unke liye party kaa sanket saaf he
 Let me tell you that the party did not choose Nand Kishore Yadav as the leader of the legislative party
 susheel modi ko rajyasabha main bheje jane kii atakalein thi
 But the party leadership also did not agree
 rajyasabha main gopal narayan singh ko bheja gaya tha
 The comments nityanand raay jati se yadav hai or dabang chhavi ke netaa hai
 Have won the assembly elections four times and now ujiyarpur se loksabhaa saansad hai
 It is believed that the team of Sushil Modi, Nand Kishore Yadav and Mangal Pandey had put the responsibility of defeat on Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in a way of not taking public responsibility after the defeat in Bihar

 adwani ne kaha ki iske baad maine phir kaha ki bhale hi donon deshon ke bich pratyrpan sandhi na ho lekani pakistan ko chahie ki vah daud ko bharat ke supurd kar de, kyonki 1993 main mumbai bam dhamaakon ke aarope us par sabit ho chuke hai

 This position of India was right and this proves that the Indian government was serious about terrorism
 adwani ne kaha ki pakistan kii koshish sadaiv bharat ko asthir karne kii rahi he
 He knows that he cannot wage war against India, so he starts promoting terrorism
 unhone kaha ki desh main lagaataar ho rahi aatankwaadi ghatataaon main kuch logon kii sanliptata ke liye kisi dharm vishesh ko nishaanaa banaaya janaa bilkul galat he
 Advani said that even though terrorist organizations quote Quran in their threatening emails, Islam should not be targeted any more

 People are posting this on social media by putting a recent photo of their 10 year old with this trend
 apni photo ke alaava log khud se judi chizon kii bhi photo soshal media plateforms par share kar rahe hai
 On the one hand, where people are sharing their old photos emotionally connected, on the other hand some people say that this is a cleverly started trend from Facebook
 taaki fasebuk apni mashin larning system ke liye umr se sambandhit data ikattha karnaa chahta he
 Now Facebook has responded to this and told that there is nothing like it
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki ye trend isliye viral he kyonki logon ko isamen majaa aa rahaa he
 Facebook has tweeted that 10yearchallenge is a user generated meme
 isse ye pataa chalata he ki logon ko fasebuk par majaa aa rahaa he or kuch nahin
 The 10 year challenge is a user-generated meme that started on its own, without our involvement
 It’s evidence of the fun people have on Facebook, and that’s it
 - Facebook (@facebook) January 16, 2019 Tech companies use user-uploaded photos to train facial recognition algorithms
 isi vajah se fasebuk kisi yujar dwaara photo aplod kiye jane ke baad cheharaa pahchaan kar photo main maujuud doston or rishtedaaron ko photo tag karne ke liye kahata he
 However, after being engulfed in some recent controversies, people's trust on Facebook has been shaken

 The farmers of Jewar village have decided to oppose land acquisition by holding a panchayat
 greater noida ke shahberi or patawaari gaanv par supreme court or elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle se javeri gaanv ke kisaanon ko hausala mila he
 The government has reserved 10,000 hectares of land in several villages of Zaveri tehsil for the airport and has told the farmers that their lands will be acquired
 javeri ke kisaanon kaa kahana he ki airport ke naam par rigerv kii gai jameen kaa dayera chaar baar badhaayaa ja chukaa he or unhen dar he ki sarkaar is jameen kaa ek bada hissaa rihaayshi coloniyaan basaane ke liye privet bilderon ko bech degi
 These farmers have demanded that they should get the right to sell their land directly to private builders
 unka kahana he ki jab tak ye maamla adaalat main sulajh nahin jaataa yahaan koi kaam nahin hone diya jayega
 Layers of corruption in the Botanical Garden built in the new capital region of Raipur are being opened like onion peels
 lekin maamle kii jaanch ko lekar van vibhaag ke aalaa afasaron ke kaanon main jun tak nahin reng rahi he
 Actually, the danger is that they may not even get exposed to corruption
 lihaaja afasar jaanch ke nirdesh ke baavjood band file kholane main hila-hawali kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the misdeeds of responsible officers in the Botanical Garden of corruption have started coming to light
 haalanki, maamle kii ucchstareey jaanch kii maang ko lekar daayar janhit yachika kii agali sunwaayee jald hi hoicourt main hone vaali he
 It is also being told that what written answer should be given to the High Court in this matter, it is only after thinking that the hands of the officers are swollen
 darasal, do maheene pehle nai rajdhani kshetra main nirmit botanical garden ke nirmaan ke wo dastavej artiai ke jariye saamne aaye jisase pataa chalaa ki kis tarah se afasaron ne karodon kii sarkari rakam par daaka daalaa tha
 Numbers of government and private cars, motorcycles and scooties were shown as heavy vehicles in government records
 afasaron ne in vaahanon ko apane ricard main trek, danpar or bulldozer bataaya
 These vehicles sometimes showed the movement of sand, soil, ballast, cement and murum and sometimes tree plants
 iske evaj main afasar karodon kii rakam dakaar gaye
 There is again a new revelation in this matter
 van vibhaag main karodon ke botanical garden nirmaan ghotaale main phir ek nayaa khulaasa hua he
 According to the information received from RTI, in the name of digging the pond in the Botanical Garden, a well-planned burglary was done
 is ghotaale main van vibhaag ke afasaron ne bina kisi bajet or prashaskeey sweekruti ke hi karodon kaa nirmaan kaam kara daalaa
 Not only this, the officials have reported the use of bikes like bike hundreds of times for digging the pond
 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat mili dastavejon se pataa chalaa he ki van vibhaag ke mukhya van sangrakshak karyaalay ne ek sarkari patr ke madhyam se 4 may ko garden nirmaan kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya tha
 In this, budget and administrative approval was sought for digging and deepening of the pond in pond numbers 3 and 4 of Botanical Garden
 van vibhaag ke mukhyalay ne ek maah baad arthath 3 june ko bajet sweekrut kiya
 But the field officers of the forest department started this work only in the first week of March without any budget approval and permission
 dastavejon se yah bhi pataa chalaa ki prastaav taiyaar hone se pehle hi van vibhaag main lakhon rupee ke bill sweekrut ho gaye or rakam afasaron kii jeb main chali gai
 RTI activists are expressing surprise that on the basis of the documents, the construction work was approved in the month of June
 uske bilon kaa bhugtan april maheene se hi hone laga
 After all, how the payment process was started is a matter of investigation
 udhar, van vibhaag ke sisief arun pandeya ke mutabikbotanical gardenmen talab kii khudaai ke purv takneekee or prashaskeey sweekruti kaise lee gai thi isaki jaanch kii jaaegi
 According to RTI activist Sanjeev Aggarwal, this is just a small sample of the forest department's arbitrary and jungle raj
 jahaan bina kisi sweekruti ke karodon rupee ke kaam shuru ho jate hai
 Fake bills are incurred and half the incomplete departmental inquiry is done for mere supply
 lekin jaanch main kin varisht afasaron ke nirdesh par manamaane dhang se ye kaam bina nivida ke kiya gaya, unke naam kaa khulaasa adhikari or vibhageeya mantri nahin karte hai

 The administration has said that whichever person is found violating it, a strict action will be taken against them by filing a case
 saath hi prashasan dwaara aise logon ko blaclist kii suchi main bhi daal diya jayega
 This means that in case of any disturbance at any time in the future, action will be taken against these people first, assuming possible trouble
