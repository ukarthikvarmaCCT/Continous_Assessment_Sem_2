 team india main kabhi bhi aise coach ko pasand nahin kiya jaataa jo apni swatantra raay rakhata ho yaa captain se alag sochataa ho

 NDTV reached Loni in Ghaziabad to know the ground situation where many illegal slaughterhouses have been closed on Wednesday
 jab ham loni main pichley 12 saal se chal rahe avaidh boojadkhaane tak pahunche tab tak police vahaan aakar sil laga chuki thi
 The eagles were sitting on the wall
 shaayad soch rahi hongi ki kal tak is diwaar ke neeche unhen khaane ke liye milane vaala maance or mare jaanavar achaanak kahaan gaayab ho gaye

 loni ke esadm premaranjan kaa kahana he ki "puure pradesh main aisi muhim chal rahi he

 They say that now their children may not survive to do this due to the closure of work, because now they are unemployed
 vahaan kai or log mili jo apane license dikhaane lage
 These slaughterhouse workers allege that their licenses were not renewed for the last 20 years
 achaanak prashasan ne unki roji-roti chin lee
 Well it is important to create an atmosphere, but the question is that if the administration was so vigilant, why were these illegal slaughterhouses not closed earlier? Why did the administration become very active as soon as a new government was formed? enditivi jamini sthiti jaanane ke liye gajiabad ke loni pahunchaa jahaan buudhvaar ko kai avaidh boojadkhaane band karaae gaye hai
 By the time we reached the illegal slaughterhouse in Loni for the last 12 years, the police had come and sealed it

 There were many more people who started showing their licenses
 boojadkhaanon ke in kamgaaron kaa aarope he ki pichley 20 saalon se unke license rineau nahin kiye ja rahe the
 Suddenly the administration took away their livelihood
 khayr maahaul bananaa bhi jaruri he, lekin sawaal yahi he ki agar prashasan itnaa hi chaukanna tha to yah avaidh boojadkhaane pehle kyon nahin band karaae gaye? kyon nai sarkaar banate hi prashasan ati sakriy ho gaya?

 Experts on this amount to be given to the banks say that giving money to state-run banks will have a major impact on the economy

 Therefore they have a decisive role in the economy
 aise main yadi sarkari bainkon ko paisa diya jaataa he to rojgaar ke avasar paidaa honge
 He is such that many industrialists are saying that they are unable to complete the projects due to lack of loans from banks
 agar sarkari bainkon ke aisi pariyojnaon ko karj detaa he to pariyojnaayen shuru hongi or aarthik gatividhi tej hogi saath hi rojgaar ke maukey banenge
 Will get GDP growth
 
 
 sarkari bainkon ko paisa milane se rojgaar ke avasar badhenge
 Also people will spend on goods and services
 isse jidipi growth hogi or public sector bainkon kii vittiya madad se sarkaar jo makasad hasil karnaa chaahati he, vah puraa hoga
 Governance of public sector banks will improve
 
 
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki yadi bainkon ko paisa diya jaataa he to iskaa asar unke gavarnence par padegaa
 Governance of public sector banks will improve and financial support from the government and recovery of debt submerged by insolvency law
 sarkaar bainkon se share bazaar se bhi puunji jutaney kii ummid kar rahi hai, bhale hi bank pichley kuch varshon main ve aisa nahin kar pai hon
 Corporate tax relief is also expected to increase employment
 
 
 bajet main korporate sector ko sarkaar ne badi saugat di he
 Till now companies with annual turnover up to Rs 250 crore were taxed at 25 percent, but now companies with annual turnover up to Rs 400 crore will be taxed at 25 percent
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki is kadam se unhen tex kaa nuksaan to hoga, lekin rojgaar badhegaa

 After the presence of King Cobra in Kumaon Division of Uttarakhand in 2011, now the Sahastradhara region Mant, which is in the Mussoorie Forest Division of Garhwal, has also found the nest of King Cobra
 van vibhaag ne isaki nigaraanee kii
 Out of the 29 eggs present in the nest, 24 hatched, while five eggs were damaged
 van vibhaag ne inhen safaltaapurvak rajaji neshnal park kshetra ke alag-alag do renjon main chhod diya he
 The forest department was monitoring the children of King Cobra from satellite through GPS
 nae bacchon ko jahaan choda gaya, us jagah kii bhi nigaraanee kii ja rahi he taaki pataa lag sake ki unamem se kitne bachche jivit bache
 According to reptile expert Romulus Whitaker, "king cobra is found in dense forests and areas with high rainfall
" ve purvottar ke rajyon, pashchim bengal, andhra pradesh, tamilnadu, karnataka, kerala or goa aadi main paae jate hai
 Whitaker has made a deep study of the natural habitat and nature of this snake
 isaki lambaai 20 foot tak ho sakati he
 The female cobra lays eggs only once a year
 is duniya ke sabase jahrile sanpon main se ek mana jaataa he or isaki lambaai bhi sabase zyada hoti he
 The only king cobra among the species of snakes is the snake that builds a nest and eats other snakes
 chunki king cobra duusare sanpon ko khate hai to isse sthaneey prajatiyon ko khatra ho saktaa he
 But Whitaker does not believe so
 unka kahana he, ''ve un naag, karait, viper jaise sanpon ko khate hai, jinke dasane se hajaaron mautein hoti hai
 "there is no threat to the local species because it is part of nature
" is main ek saath 20 logon ko maarane laayak vish chhodie kii kshamta hoti he
 The finding of King Cobra's nest near the population in the Sahasradhara region is also indicative of its changing migration
 visheshgy iskaa adhyayan kar rahe hai
 These snakes were believed to be found only in the rainforest but as Whitaker says, "we used to believe that they live in the rainforest, but now we find them in Odisha, in the forests of the Garan, the grasslands of Kaziranga and Andhra Looking into the small forests of the state, which is a very hot and dry state

 Abhishek Singh, who has practical knowledge of the behavior and nature of snakes, says, "we have contacts and network with local people
 is kaaran hamen vanyajeevon se sambandhit jaankariyaan milti rahati hai
 "due to their specialty, they have also trained more than 500 forest guards in the forest department regarding snakes

 Bas ab Kuch kar dikhao! 🇮🇳 uttar pradesh ke dibapur main bhartiya janata party ke pratyaashee shiv pratap rajput ke samarthan main 20 farvari ko yojit raily main party ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne jab bhi batla house cond main maare gaye inspector mohan chandra sharma kaa naam liya, to uske aage pandit shabd jarur joda
 Gadkari said, "why does Sonia have tears at the death of terrorists, why don't she worry about the family of martyr Pandit Mohan Chandra Sharma?" The special thing in this election speech is that the Brahmin's self-respect was awakened to win his candidate
 dekhen UP chunaav par vistrut kaverejasube main ab tak bane 19 mukhyamantriyon main se 14 savarna rahe hai
 From independence till the early 90s, the politics of the state was Thakur vs Brahmin vs Baniya, and then hardly any leader thought of such caste alliances
 lekin pichley do dashak main pehle pichhadon or uske baad dalit raajnneeti ke ufaan main savarnon kii hekdi kuch aisi nikali ki ve thakur-brahman-baniyaa-kysth kaa bhed bhuulakar ek manch par aane ko majaboor hue or is majaburi ke eka main bhaajapa or congress ko apni badhat dikh rahi he
 Actually, during the first four phases of voting in the state, an average of 58 per cent of the votes were cast
 yah aankada 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii tulana main 15 fisadi adhik he
 In such a situation, there is a perception that the Dalit voter had voted with his full capacity even last time, so the voters of the upper castes should have a substantial share in the increased voting this time
 poling booth tak gaadi se jane kii chhot milane ke kaaran agadi jatiyon kii mahilaon ne bhi khub vot daale
 Regarding the zeal of the forward and the trend of silent mobilization about voting, Professor of Political Science at Lucknow University, Dr
 ramesh dikshit bataate hai, ‘duusari jatiyon kii bhaanti savarna samudaay ke brahman, thakur, vaisya or kysth lambey samay tak rajnatik ikai ke rup main sangathit nahin ho paae the
 This is the reason why his influence in the political field was stopped
 ve bhale hi ghoshit taur par na sahi lekin shaayad nae rajnatik maahaul main ve nae nazariye se vot daal rahe hai
 'hariom Pathak, president of the Uttar Pradesh Brahmin Mahamandal, pointing to this new perspective, says,' Due to the neglect found during the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments, both the Brahmin or the entire upper castes
 Is intent on opposing jo savarna mayawati kii soshal ejineering ke chalate 2007 main basapa ke saath khadey the, ve ab congress or bhaajapa kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 "expressing a similar attitude in the Thakur community," said Shailendra Singh Bundela, president of Jhansi Mandal Kshatriya Samaj, "hundreds of Kshatriyas under my leadership had become members of the BSP before the last election
 lekin basapa main kshatriyon kii jis tarah upeksha or beijjati hui, use panidaar thakur kaum kabhi nahin bhula sakati
 'though the opinion of these representatives of the Brahmin and Thakur community cannot be considered the general opinion of these communities, but there is no reason to dismiss it completely
 vaise, agadi jatiyon ko apane saath jode rakhane ke liye basapa or sapa ne koi kasar nahin chodi he
 If we look at the candidates of all the parties, it is found that the BSP has relied on 117 upper castes, SP 116, Congress 116 and BJP 180 most
 vidhansabha chunaavisiilie savarna voter se bhaajapa kii ummiden bhi zyada hai
 In its manifesto, the party has said to create a Savarna commission in the state on the lines of Bihar and give reservation to poor upper castes
 party ke varisht netaa or lakhanu se saansad lalji tandon kehete hai, ‘sapa or basapa kii sarkaron ne savarnon kii upeksha kii he or isse naaraaz yah varg ab bhaajapa kii ore jhukaa he
 'together they do not forget to say according to the party line,' BJP is saying not only the upper caste but all sections of the society to take along
 ’kendriya mantri or congress netaa pradeep jain aditya kehete hai, ‘basapa main brahmanon or savarnon kii jamkar beijjati hui
 This class is now with the Congress
 ’ unke mutabik agadi jatiyon ke saath hi samaaj ke har varg kaa samarthan congress ko hasil he
 Dalits, extremely backward and Muslims stand with the party

 But given the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the bjp's path seems difficult
 zyada sambhaavna yahi he ki pidipi apni 'dharmanirpeksh' chhavi ko banaae rakhte hue congress se haath mila sakati he

 - a lot of positive energy comes out from the swastika made in the right way - This energy is helpful in protecting, protecting the object or person - If the energy of the swastika is used in home, hospital or daily life, then the person is disease free and anxious
 Can remain free - the wrongly used swastika can also give terrible problems, never do insult to the mother, otherwise the murderers will have to suffer What are the correct rules of usage? - The lines and angles of the swastika must be absolutely correct - Do not forget to construct and use the inverted swastika - Red and yellow swastika are the best - if the swastika is to be worn, it should be rounded
 If you are not selling any property, then how do you use these measures? - Where there is a Vastu defect or at the main gate of the house

 On compromising on the highest security provided by the government, Shah revealed that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi went on 99 foreign trips since 1991, not seeking protection of the SPG on 78 such trips

 com / 7iykglp6eg— ANI UP (@aninewsup)august 7, 2016 If an issue is to be misguided, then how should it be learned from what happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Wednesday
 ovaisi kii party eimm ke vidhayak vaaris pathan ko isliye sari party ke netaaon ne milakar vidhansabha adhiveshan se suspend kiya kyonki unhone bharat mata kii jai bolne se inkaar kar diya
 On looking at the above, this seems correct, especially after Javed Akhtar's speech in Rajya Sabha, what is the objection of the mother of India
 vaaris baar-baar ye bolte rahe kii wo jai hind bolenge lekin bharat mata kii jai nahin bolenge
 Heir Pathan is a lawyer by profession and knowledgeable in law
 to kanoon par ungali rakhkar wo ye kehete rahe ki unase koi jabardastee nahin kar saktaa
 But the issue is not of law but of emotions and it is unnecessarily gaining importance
 bal thakare ke smarak se shuru hua vivadasadan main mudda koi chal rahaa tha charchaa kisi or vishay par ho rahi thi or baat bharat mata kii jai tak pahunch gai
 The motion of thanks on the Governor's address was being discussed in the House

 Opposing the government's money to build a memorial for Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, he asked why taxpayers' money is being spent to build a memorial for Shiv sena-bjp leaders? Taking objection to that, Shiv Sena BJP mlas asked him whether he was opposing the memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji

 On this, Jalil refused and said Vijay Mallya has run away with a lime of 9000 crores while speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 is bich vaaris pathan ne shivasena bijepi vidhayakon ko chunauti di ki wo bharat mata kii jai nahin bolenge or phir baat suspension tak pahunch gai
 The issue reached somewhere else
 1998 main bhi bani thi aisi sthitiye baat thik he kii bharat mata kii jai bolne par kisi ko bhi aapatti nahi honi chahie lekin rajyapal ke abhibhaashan par chal rahaa bhaashan kahin or hi bhatak gaya
 It seems to have become a way
 1998 main bhi kuch isi tarah kii ghatana ghati thi
 Same Maharashtra assembly place

 Discussion was going on on the report of Sri Krishna Commission on Mumbai riots in which Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray was blamed
 mukhyamantri manohar joshi ke netritvvali shivasena-bijepi sarkaar is report ko thukaraane kaa man bana chuki thi
 In response to the ongoing discussion on this, Manohar Joshi said that if the Shiv Sena had not been there, Mumbai would not have survived in the 1992 riots
 congress or sapa ne jataai thi aapattivirdohi congress or samaajawaadee party ke sadasyon ne is bayaan par aapatti jataai
 After which Manohar Joshi pointed to Samajwadi Party MLA Sohail Lokhandwala and said that some people do not speak Vande Mataram at the end of the proceedings of the House
 us par hamaari najar rahegi
 Sohail Lokhandwala objected to this saying that Muslims do not speak Vande Mataram as they do not do idol worship
 iske baad vande maataram naa kehane par vivaad shuru ho gaya
 Significantly, after the 1992 riots, there was a religious polarization of votes in Mumbai in the 1995 assembly elections, in which the Congress was reduced to 1 out of 34 seats in Mumbai while the newly formed Samajwadi Party won 3 seats in Mumbai
 alpsankhyak votonka base samaajawaadee party kii taraf jhukne kii vajah se congress ko baari nuksaan hua tha
 Seeing the debates of the Assembly, it seemed that this was an attempt to strengthen polarization in the name of Vande Mataram
 haalanki vande maataram naa kehane main sohail lokhandwala kii bhoomika par samaajawaadee party main bhi kaiyon ne aapatti jataai ye kahkar ki ashfak ulla khan ne bhi faansee chadhate vakt vande maataram kaa naaraa diya tha
 But this dispute had the benefit of both the Samajwadi Party as well as the Shiv Sena BJP
 MIM banaam bijepi-shivasena ho rahi he ladaimaharashtra main aaj kii sthiti main MIM kii takat bad rahi he
 The party opened its account by winning two seats in the 2014 assembly elections, but before that, the party started raising its foot in Marathwada in Aurangabad, Nanded, Latur as well as Solapur and Mumbai
 ye congress ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban rahaa he
 When the Congress comes to power, the performance of the party in Marathwada and Mumbai is good and minority votes have a strong hand in it
 ovaisi kii party ne ye base khokhla karnaa shuru kiya he to bhavishya main MIM banaam bijepi yaa shivasena jitna zyada hoga utana congress ko nuksaan hona hi he
 Then there will be Vande Mataram in it, sometimes Bharat Mata ki Jai

 People start to judge without thinking anything
 bhansaali ek plan kar rahe hai or is bemail casting kii ek khaas vajah he
 i am very excited to work with Salman Khan
 maine bhi nahin sochaa tha ki meri or salmaan kii bemail jodi kabhi ek saath kaam karegi
 "while Salman said," i hope this is going to be an interesting journey

 1994 ke ismail faruki cese parasupreme courtne apana faisla guuruuvaar ko sunaaya
 According to the Supreme Court's decision, there is no need to refer the 1994 case to a larger bench
 court ne kaha ki hamen 1994 vaale faisle ko samajhane kii jarurat hogi
 a petition was filed by Muslim parties to reconsider this decision of the Supreme Court, on which the judgment was reserved by the bench headed by Chief Justice Deepak Mishra on 20 July
 kya tha ismail faruki kerryodhya main karsevakon ne 6 disambar, 1992 main babarimasjidko gira diya tha
 After this, on 7 January 1993, the Central Government, by bringing an ordinance, acquired 67 acres of land in Ayodhya
 iske tahat vivaadit jameen kaa 120x80 feet hissaa bhi adhigrahit kar liya gaya tha jise babari masjid-ram janmabhumi parisar kaha jaataa he
 Ismail Farooqui challenged this decision of the central government in the Supreme Court in his petition and said how the government can acquire the religious site
 is par sunwaayee karte hue sheersh adaalat ne kaha tha ki masjid memnmajpadhanislamka anivaary hissaa nahin he
 The Muslim community does not agree on this decision of the Supreme Court
 ve chaahate hai ki supreme court apane faisle par dobaaraa vichaar kare
 The Muslim community also wants that the judgment on the 1994 Ismail Farooqui case be revisited before the judgment in the case relating to the ownership of disputed land in Ayodhya
 bataa den ki is saal 7 july ko chif justise kii adhyakshata vaali teen jajon kii bench ayodhya main vivaadit jameen ke malikana haq se jude maamle kii jab sunwaayee kar rahi thi to muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne masjid main namaaj padhanaa islam kaa anivaary hissaa he yaa nahin he, is maamle ko samvidhan peeth ke paas bhejne kii maang kii thi
 His plea was to listen carefully to the arguments of the Muslim community and be tested
 sunwaayee ke dauraan rajeev dhawan ne kaha tha ki islam samuhikta kaa majahab he
 Although namaz can be recited anywhere, but when there is a collective namaz on Friday, it is recited in the mosque
 unhone kaha ki puri duniya main islam kii shuruyaat se hi yah parampara he
 In this regard, we have submitted 24 verses of the Quran to the Supreme Court, which proves that reciting the Namaz in the mosque is the main part of Islam, says Muslim party Mohammad Khalid
 vahiin, hindu pakshakaron kaa kahana he ki yadi is maamle kii sunwaayee dobaaraa shuru hoti he to iskaa asar tittle suut se jude mukhya maamle kii sunwaayee par pad saktaa he
 Explain that if the Supreme Court sends this matter to the big bench of the Constitution, then the hearing of the main case can be stuck for a long time

 Hamirpur kushtiyaan to aapane bahut dekhi hongin, lekin kya aapane ghunghat vaali kushti bhi dekhi he
 Hundreds of women fall into the arena with the veil
 bina kisi umr ke bandhan ke sab kii sab ek duusare ko dharti par patakekar chit karne main tulin hon
 If you have not seen such wrestling, then we will take you to Hamirpur district of Bundelkhand where veil wrestling has become a practice
 yah pratha shuru to british fouj ke khilaaf mahilaon ko ladane ke liye taiyaar karne ko kii gai thi, lekin kaayam saikadon saal baad bhi he
 According to Hamirpur journalist Pankaj Mishra, many local women of the village now celebrate it as a celebration
 vahiin, jis din is ghunghat vaale mahila dangal kaa aayojan hota he us din gaanv ke mardon ko gaanv ke baahar kar diya jaataa he or lathait mahilaayein paharaa detii hai taaki koi mard unki kushti ke daav-pench kaa chashmadid na ban sake
 This is also where women's wrestling first started
 bundelkhand ke hamirpur jile kaa muskaraa kshetra rakshabandhan ke ek din baad surkhiyon main rahata he
 After the Rakshabandhan, women conduct veil wrestling with great vigor, but no men are allowed to watch it
 pehali baar is anokhi kushti kaa video saamne aayaa he, jise dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 Just a day after Rakshabandhan, a village in Bundelkhand came under discussion
 is gaanv main ilaake kii mahilaayein shaam ko ikaitha huin or vahaan ek aisa aayojan kiya gaya jisamen mahilaon ko hi mahilaon se bhidana tha
 The crowd of thousands of women was a spectacle
 dhol bajte hi muqabla shuru ho gaya
 Women entered the wrestling arena with full tenacity
 ghunghat chadaaye hue kushti ke daav pench kii is anokhi pratispardhaa ne sabhi ko romanchit kar diya
 How the beginning of this wrestling practice is about 250 years old
 jab british fouj ne desh kii tamaam jagahon par kabja kar liya or vah hindustaniyon par julm dhane lage to inase muqabla karne ke liye mahilaayein bhi kud padi
 For the sake of their dignity, women united several villages in Hamirpur district of Bundelkhand and then prepared the women for the fight
 us daur main ghunghat pratha bundelkhand main sab par haaavee thi isliye iskaa bhi maan rakhte hue mahilaayein ghunghat main hi akhaade main pahunchane lageen
 There he learned the tricks of wrestling and fighting, then confronted the British
 aaj bhi jile ke muskaraa kshetra ke lodhipur nivaada gaanv main ghunghat vaali kushti kaa aayojan puraani parampara ko jeevant rakhe hue hai
 Malati Devi Shukla of the Gram Panchayat Steering Committee says, this is a very old practice which gives the message of women to become self-reliant and empowered
 bundelkhand main maharani lakshmibai akeli virangana nahin thim jo angrejon ke khilaaf ladiin balki hamirpur main to iske pehle hi mahilaayein angrej fouj ke khilaaf utar padi thim
 Lakshmi Devi of the village says that no man can enter the village at the time of wrestling in the village
 aaj bhi is gaanv kii mahilaayein kushti kaa abhyaas karti hai
 Who gave Patkni? Who tells that Kalsia wrestled between Munni Devi in dangal, on which Kalsia slammed Munni Devi into the arena
 siyadulari va leelavati ke bich romaanchak kushti karaayi gai jisamen siyadulari ne use akhaade kii dhul chataakar dangal apane naam kiya
 a fierce wrestling ensued between Lakshmi and Lakshmi, a member of the Steering Committee of the Gram Panchayat, in which Lakshmi slammed her into the arena
 tamaam bujurg mahilaon ke bich bhi kushti hui
 Pangaj Mishra, journalist from Dangal, Hamirpur, continues from the time of the British, says the women's riot has been going on since the British
 unhone bataaya ki angrej sainikon ke atyaachaar kaa saamana karne ke liye us jamaane main mahilaon ne akhaade main daanvpench siikhe the
 Since then, the tradition has persisted

 There is also a record Indian team on this ground
 yah team beete 26 saal se yahaan haari nahin he
 Now the challenge before the young Indian team of '27 years' is whether it can maintain this record or not
 bharat kii yuva brigadeke aadha darjan se adhik khilaadi 26 saal se kam ke hai
 The funny thing is that when the Indian team lost in Kotla for the last time, they were not even born and the rest of them would not have learned the story of cricket except a few

 iske baad 1979 se 1983 ke bich paanch match benatija rahe or phir 1984 main bharat ko ek baar phir england ne patkhni di
 Just before the 1987 defeat to the West Indies, the teams of India and Australia clashed on this ground, which did not yield results
 varsh 1987 main bharat ne westeindies se patkhni khaane ke baad is maidan par apana ajey kram barkaraar rakhaa or uske baad kul 10 maichon main se nau main jeet hasil kii
 In 2008, there was a clash with Australia once again, which was inconclusive
 is maidan par bharat or australia ke bich 22 march se saatvaan match khelaa jayega
 So far India has won two matches while Australia has won one
 teen match barabari par chute hai
 India defeated Australia in 1996 and 1969
 vaise kotla par ab tak kaa sabase bemisaal recordnil kumbleke naam he, jinhone 1999 main pakistan ke khilaaf duusari pari main sabhi 10 wicket lekar gym lekar ke karname kii barabari kii thi

 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main arthvyavastha kaa mudda ahm sabit hua or voter ne manmohan singh ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 The new NDA government formed under Narendra Modi's leadership in May 2014 raised huge expectations from voters, besides global investors
 niveshkon ko bharosa tha ki yah nai sarkaar duniya ke sabase bade loktantr kii arthvyavastha ko na sirf sahi raah par khadaa karegi balki ek tej raftaar ke saath-saath desh ke saamne khadi aarthik chunautiyon ko dur karne kaa kaam karegi
 Lok Sabha elections are knocking once again
 modi sarkaar niveshkon or votaron kii us ummid ko sambhavat: bhuuli nahin he or ab apane kaarykaal ke aakhri saal main uski koshish un aarthik aankadon ko apane paksh karne kii he jinpar vaishvik niveshkon or votaron kii najar rahegi
 GDP: During the last three years, there has been a dispute regarding the estimation of GDP in the country
 modi sarkaar ke pehle saal ke kaarykaal ke baad 2015 main kendra sarkaar ke sankhyaki vibhaag (CSO) ne jidipi ke aankalan karne ke liye nirdhaarit vitt varsh main badlaav karte hue paddati main bhi bada parivartan kiya
 The result of this change was that the central government got a large figure of GDP growth
 udhaaharan ke liye dekhen to nae formule ke mutabik jahaan vitt varsh 2013-14 main jidipi vikaas dar 6
 2 per cent was recorded, whereas in the old formula it was just 4
 8 fisadi darj hoti he
 During this period, special figures are available from the production sector because the old formula records the growth rate of -2%, while the new formula estimates it at 6%
 is anischitata ke bich desh kii vaastavik vikaas dar kya he ise kendra sarkaar ko aam chunaavon ses pehle kay karnaa he kyonki yah anischitata bani rahane par use chunaavon main nuksaan uthaanaa padaa saktaa he
 Petrol, Diesel and Inflation: After the Modi government took over the reins of the country in 2014, the global market started showing a major decline in crude oil prices
 vahiin 2014 se pehle manmohan singh sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kaccha tel vaishvik bazaar main 100 dollar prati bairal ko todate hue desh main mahangaai kaa bada sankat lekar khadaa ho gaya tha
 At the same time, during 2015, 2016 and 2017, crude oil remained at its record low level, due to which the Central Government benefited from the revenue as well as helped in curbing inflation
 lekin ab aam chunaavon main ek saal se kam samay baaki he or vaishvik bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat lagaataar bad rahi he
 The result is that at present the prices of petrol and diesel in the country have reached their peak and the rising inflation numbers are continuously troubling the central government
 is chunavi varsh main kachche tel kii vaishvik keemat main ijapha yadi mahangaai ko belgaum karata he to chunaavon main vipaksh kaa hamalaa sanbhaalanaa sattarudh party ke liye chunauti se bharaa hoga
 Therefore, there is a need to rein in the price of petrol-diesel rising due to rising crude oil prices, so that inflation figures do not become an election issue
 rojgaar: kendra sarkaar kaa daawa he ki desh main rojgaar kii samasya nahin he balki rojgaar ke aankadon kii samasya he
 During the last one year, the Prime Minister, including many Union Ministers, has claimed that jobs have been created as per the requirements during his tenure, but most of these jobs have not been included in the government figures
 sarkaar kii daleel he ki nae yug kii nai naukariyon kii gananaa karne ke liye desh main istemaal ho rahe dashakon puraane formule ko badalane kii jarurat he
 Economists affiliated to the Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India and IIM Bangalore also accept the government's argument and further argue that the Central Government's EPFO figures are not sufficient to calculate employment accurately
 vahiin centre for iconomic sarkaar kii daleel se ittefaq nahin rakhte or daawa karte hai ki desh main tej aarthik raftaar ke baavjood jarurat ke mutabik naukariyon kaa srijan nahin ho rahaa he
 Therefore, now the central government should remove the differences before the elections and ensure its data whether the employment figures have improved during his work in the country

 Many parents feel that the more they protect their child from dust and dirt and the external environment, the more healthy the child will be
 lekin kya vaaki aisa he? bilkul nahin
 Despite being protected from dust and soil, such children often fall ill while in the villages, children playing in dust, mud and open are relatively more healthy
 kuch aisi hi soch nakhun chabane or angootha chusane ko lekar bhi he
 It is generally believed that thumb sucking and chewing of nails is a bad habit, which makes children fall ill
 maa-baap ko dar hota he ki isse kai tarah ke bacteria bachche ke sharir main pravesh kar jaaenge, jisase baccha biimaar pad saktaa he
 But this is not completely true

 According to this research in New Zealand, nail chewing and thumb sucking children become less ill

 Parents of children aged 5, 7, 9 and 11 were asked about their habits for this study
 uske baad jab ye bachche 13 saal ke hue to unki twachaa kaa pareekshan kiya gaya

 a day before the MCD election in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal's old partner and member of the Swaraj Abhiyan, Yogendra Yadav has written a letter to CM Kejriwal
 yogendra yadav ne apni chitti main kejariwal ko dilli kii gandagi or kharaab halaat ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya he
 He wrote that Kejriwal has broken the trust of the people of Delhi
 saath hi unhone aam aadmi party ke vaadon kaa zikr karte hue likhaa he ki kejariwal ne dilli kii janata se laalach, dar or dhamkee dekar vot hasil karne kii koshish kii he
 Arvind Kejriwal named Yogendra Yadav Patriya Arvind, the historic mandate that Delhi gave two years ago was not the charisma of any single leader or party
 uske peeche hazaron volantir kaa tyaag or unki tapasya thi
 But the biggest reason for this charism was the self-confidence of the people of Delhi
 janalokapal andolan se dilli ke lakhon nagarikon ko yah bharosa dilaayaa kii wo bechaare nahin hai
 They are more powerful than leaders, parties and governments
 aaj main us aatmbal ko dagamagaate hue dekh rahaa hoon
 That is why i am communicating with you for the first time in the last two years and i am reminded of the promise of recall made at Ramlila Maidan
 pichley maheene main mujhe dilli nagar nigam (MCD) ke chunaav ke dauraan dilli ke kone-kone main jane kaa mauka mila
 There are piles of garbage all around in Delhi, dirty water is stagnant, smelly and dangerous air
 har koi jaanata he kii isaki pehali jimmevary pichley das saal se MCD par raaj kar rahi bijepi kii he
 But still the BJP is shamelessly standing in this election, asking for votes
 aise bahut voter hai jinhone 2015 main aitihaasik badlaav ke liye vot diya tha, lekin jo is baar thak-haar ke bijepi ke paas vaapis ja rahe hai
 i have been thinking since last month, who is responsible for giving the BJP running this poor and corrupt government a chance to stand in the MCD election
 bahut sochane ke baad main is nishkarsh par panhucha hoon ki dilli kii is durghatana ke liye vyaktigat rup se aap jimmevaar hai
 You have broken the trust of the people of Delhi
 vishwaas sirf ek netaa yaa party se nahin tutaa he
 The public has lost faith in themselves - after being deceived by you, they feel that they do not recognize the good and the bad
 isliye toote man se bahut log unhi puraani partiyon ke paas ja rahe hai jinhe unhone do saal pehle kaarij kar diya tha
 In democracy, it is a great sin to arouse the hope of the people and break it
 janata ke aatmbal ko kamjor karnaa sabase bada aparaadh hai
 i am forced to say that you have committed this crime in your ego, self-fascination and greed for the chair
 ye sirf main nahin kahata, dilli ke har mohalle or gali main har koi ye kahata he
 During this election campaign, i see the signs of "anti-destructive intelligence" in the greed, fear and threat you have threatened the voters
 jaahir he aap mujhase sahamat nahin honge
 You have repeatedly said that the people of Delhi are with you
 dilli main kal hone vaale MCD ke chunaav ko apane apni vyaktigat lokapriyata ke referendom main badal diya he
 Your party is only seeking votes in your name
 hording main party kaa naam tak nahin he
 Your party has also released an internal survey that your party is winning the MCD election with 218 seats
 meraa ek prastaav he
 If you get an overall majority (ie only 137 seats) in all three mcds in this election then i will assume that my understanding is wrong and the people of Delhi do not consider you as a fraud
 aise main agar centre sarkaar aapaki sarkaar ke khilaaf koi shadyantra karti he to hamaari party or main khud aapkaa samarthan karenge
 But if you lose in this referendum within two years of winning 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi, then morality demands that you do not make any excuse like EVM, resign from the post of Chief Minister and your government 'recall' in Delhi According to the principle of, get the trust vote again from the public

 These days, there is a war between two states over the species of chicken named Kadaknath
 is prajati ke murge kii GI tag ko lekar madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh donon hi rajya apana apana daawa kar rahe hai
 Madhya Pradesh claims that it owns the GI tag, as the main source of this species is Jhabua district of their state
 chhattisgarh kaa daawa he ki yah brid jhabua se zyada dantewada main pai jaati he
 Here, its conservation and natural reproduction has been done for centuries
 chhattisgarh ke is daawey par fikki ne bhi muhar lagaai he
 Dantewada Collector Saurabh Kumar has stated his stand regarding GI tag, saying that he does not mind that GI tag should not be given to Jhabua of Madhya Pradesh
 is maamle main chhattisgarh ke dantewada ko najar andaaj nahin kiya janaa chahie
 According to him, in this Dantewada district alone, about 1
5 lakh annual chicken fowl is produced

 According to him, the production of this species of murti is being encouraged as farming

 ’ a murder incident in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow last year shook the entire police department
 marane vaala shahar kaa ek property dealer tha
 Which was shot dead at midnight
 is hatyakand ko sulajhane main police ne raat din ek kar diya tha
 And when the matter was revealed, everyone was shocked knowing the reality
 aise hua tha jaid kaa murdermau
 Zaid Shakeel was a youth leader as well as a property dealer
 use cricket match kaa shauk tha
 On the day of the incident i
e
 4 June 2016, at midnight, he was going back home after watching a night cricket match with his friend Farhan
 tabhi eshbagh ke waterworks rod par anjuman cinema ke paas peeche se do bike savaar badmaash aae or unhone jaid par tabadatod firing shuru kar di
 During this, Zaid received several shots
 jabaki farhaan batch gaya
 Zaid was killed in the incident
 is khabar se puure lakhanu shahar main sansani fail gai thi
 SP Crime handled the investigation, commander Zaid was related to influential family
 uske pita shakeel pataakhon ke bade kaarobaari hai
 And Sambhal's former MP and senior leader Shafiqur Rahman Burke seems to be her maternal grandfather in the relationship
 vah khud bhi yuva netaa tha
 So the case of his murder was no less than a challenge to the police
 pehle police ko lag rahaa tha ki maamla kisi property ke vivaad kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Because Zaid used to act as a property
 maamle ke koi ahm suraag haath nahin aa rahe the
 Then this case was filed by Lucknow's Tej Tarrar SP Crime Dr
 sanjay kumaar ne khud apane haathon main liya
 Surveillance's help police first examined the deceased's mobile phone
 phir uski sidiaar nikalwai gai
 On the basis of this, the police around Zaid and those who met him were put on surveillance
 is dauraan police ko kol ricard se jaid ke dost farhaan par kuch shaq hua
 This was the same Farhan who was riding the bike on the night of the incident, and Zaid was sitting behind him
 police ne farhaan se poochtacha karne kaa faisla kiya or farhaan ko bula liya
 Must Read: Jisha was killed by molesting animals
 Such was the fate of Shakpulis on Farhan that why the path through which Zaid always came home, why he came on the other way on the day of the incident
 kyonki vah us raat farhaan ke saath tha to police ke shaq kii sui usee kii taraf gum rahi thi
 The attackers fired so many bullets, but the question of how Farhan survived was also making him suspicious
 shuru main farhaan police ko bahalane kii koshish karata rahaa
 The police was also checking his phone details
 lekin baad main vah police kii sakhti ke saamne tut gaya
 After the affair, Zaid's death began to unravel the murder case
 police ko pataa chalaa ki dilli kii tihaad jail main band kukhyat apradhi or serial killer saleem ne is katl kii sajeesh rachi thi
 Actually, Salim was acquainted with Zaid
 lekin uske jail chale jane ke baad jaid or uski patni anjum aara ek duusare ke kareeb aa gaye the
 Both used to go together
 un donon ko kai baar saath dekha gaya tha
 When Salim came to know about this, he made up his mind to hide Zaid
 jiske liye shooter kii zarurat thi
 Must Read: The bloody conspiracy to murder two girls in Delhi was planned at the railway station, in fact 13 days before the murder of Zaid i
e
 on 25 May 2016, Gangster Salim was brought from Tihar Jail to Kanpur Court for production of a case i went
 vahiin railway stesan ke rest room main usne apane gurgon ke saath milakar jaid ko raste se hataane kii yojana banaai
 For this, he asked Farhan to deepen his friendship with Zaid and also selected two sharp shooters for the job
 jisamen saleem kaa khaas shooter ravi gautam bhi shaamil tha
 Three shooters were sent to Lucknow for this purpose
 sajeesh main shaamil 5 log giraftaarfarhaan ke pakad main aane ke baad police ne uski nishandehi par is maamle kul milakar paanch logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 But the police is still searching for Ravi Gautam and his accomplices who carried out the murder
 is maamle main saleem ke khilaaf ek or mukadmaa darj kar liya gaya
 The greatest feature with nationalism is that anyone can claim to know it without knowing it
 19veen sadi se pehle to iske bare main koi jaanata hi nahin tha lekin pichley 200 saalon main raashtra or rashtrawaad kaa swaroop ubharta chalaa gaya
 Fascism also came in the name of nationalism in these 200 years when millions of people were put into gas chambers and killed
 hamaare hi desh main rashtrawaad kaa naam japate japate apaat kaal bhi aayaa or duniya ke kai deshon main ekadhikaarwaad jise angreji main totalitarian state kehete hai
 In which you do not do what the state and its head do not like
 satta par jis party kaa kabza hota he wo police ke dam par aapke naak main dam kar detii he
 In my opinion, political parties do not have or should not have the ultimate definition of nationalism
 maine kaha ki raajnneetik dalon ke paas rashtrawaad kii antim paribhaasha tab hoti he jab unka iraadaa loktantr ko khatm kar dena hota he
 Have you ever noticed that political party workers are shouting slogans against their own party during any policy, event and scam that the country is important for them and not the party
 aisa hota to bijepi se pehle congress ke kaaryakarta 2ji ghotaale ke khilaaf sadakon par aa gaye hote
 If this happens, BJP workers and leaders would resign from the party on the Vyapam scam
 desh jab 200 rupee kilo daal kha rahaa tha to apni hi sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karte

 Sujeet was killed
 kya aap ummid karenge ki congress, sipiem ke netaa is hatya cond ke khilaaf sadak par utrenge
 Would you expect all BJP leaders to be their own leaders o
 pi
 Will hit the road against Sharma
 ninda paraninda chhod dijie
 Therefore, the politics of the parties is in the interest of the parties
 hinsa kaa itihaas aapako har raajnneetik dal kii sarkaar main milegaa
 You cannot see every incident through the prism of nationalism
 dange kis dal kii sarkaar main nahin hue or kis dal kaa naam nahin aayaa he, to kya aap unhen gaddaar yaa rashtravirohi kahenge
 i am not saying that political party people are not patriots
 bilkul hote hai
 Each party imagines a decoration to decorate the country according to their thinking
 lekin jab dharm, nasl, rang, bhashaa or yahaan tak ki tex ke naam par rashtrawaad ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he to uskaa iraadaa rashtrawaad nahin hota
 He intends something else
 rashtrawaad ke naam par apana ekadhikaar kaam karnaa
 Silence every argument
 jahaan dal or netaa kii chalati he
 All the others follow his directions
 jeenyu main bharat ko todane or barbaadi ke naare lagane waalon kii abhi tak pahchaan kyon nahin hui he
 Why news is coming from sources
 sabhi ne inkaa virodh kiya he
 All the students and teachers of JNU too
 unka virodh kanhaiya kumaar kii giraftaar ko lekar he jiske khilaaf abhi tak deshadroh ke koi saboot nahin mili hai
 Delhi Police says that now if they apply for surety, they will not protest
 wo noujvaan he, use doosraa mauka diya ja saktaa he
 Prior to this change of heart, JNU was ransacked in the street alleging that anti-national elements study there
 patiala house court main duusare din bhi jo hua wo kya he
 Will any crowd stand with the tricolor in their hands, then it will become more patriotic than us
 kya ab tirangaa lekar logon ko daraaya jayega or insaaf ke haq se vanchit kiya jayega
 Despite the resentment of the Supreme Court, Kanhaiya Kumar was assaulted on the second day
 supreme court ne jin vakeelon ko court ke bheetar jane kii anumati di thi unhone bataaya ki gaaliyaan di gai hai
 There is an atmosphere of fear
 supreme court ne hastkshep kar sunwaayee roak di or court room ko khaali karaayaa
 Kanhaiya Kumar was sent to judicial custody for 14 days
 tees hazari court ke vakeelon ne kaha he ki patiala court maamle main yadi kisi vakil ko giraftaar kiya gaya to dilli police kaa virodh kiya jayega
 All the associations of Delhi are considering going on strike
 sunwaayee hui nahin, faisla aayaa nahin lekin channelon or vakeelon or sanghathanon ne aatankwaadi ghoshit kar diya
 If such a crowd picks you up and declares that there are terrorists and kills you with a tricolor in your hand, then where will you go for justice
 itihaas main yah sab hua he
 There have been murders of political opponents, calling them anti-national
 germany main saath lakh yahudiyon ko gas kii bhatti main jhonk diya gaya
 These are their risks of nationalism
 in khataron par hameshaa baat honi chahie tab to or jab log rashtrawaad kii khubiyaan baghaarne main jute hon
 At Kolkata's Jadhavpur University, some students raised slogans of independence and supported Afzal Guru
 inhen radical group kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 One student clarified that we raised the slogan of freedom in the context of freedom of expression, one student said that he has raised slogans for the freedom of Kashmir and Afzal Guru
 mere naare rashtravirohi kaise ho sakate hai kyonki bijepi ne to pidipi se milakar sarkaar banaai he or pidipi ke liye afzal guru shahid he
 Many students have opposed such thinking and many organizations have condemned it
 jadhavpur uniwarsity ke visi ne kaha he ki jin logon ne naare lagaae wo vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr nahin the, baahar ke asaamaajik tatv the
 The Vice Chancellor has said that the democratic right of students should not be taken away due to the actions of anti-social elements
 kanoon ke panne par deshadroh kii alag samaj he or janata ke dilo dimag main alag
 There are infinite explanations for nationalism in the history books
 awwal to rashtrawaad or deshbhakti donon main hi milon kaa antar he
 If we use political talk in a complex matter, then you audience should read ten or twenty books of history before becoming nationalist
 raashtragan likhane vaale tagaur ne rashtrawaad ko ajgar saapon kii ekta niti kaha tha
 Even by such examples our understanding is not clear
 magar rashtrawaad ko uchakkon kii sharansthali bhi kaha gaya he or rashtrawaad ke liye logon ne sarvocch balidaan bhi diye hai
 The professors at JNU have decided to hold a public class on nationalism for the next one week
 paanch baje se ye class lagegi
 On Wednesday, Professor Gopal Guru took the first class among thousands of students
 topic tha raashtra kya he
 After this, Professor G
 Arunima, Tanika Sarkar, Nivedita Menon, Ayesha Kidwai, Achin Vinayak will lecture on nationalism
 ye khubi aapako sirf jeenyu main milegi
 i have two requests
 ek ki yah open class ho sake to hindi main bhi ho or doosraa isamen aresas se jude prophessoron ko bhi rashtrawaad par lacture dene ke liye bulaayaa jaae
 Nationalism has been the most powerful ideology of the 19th century that changed us humans forever
 ek raashtra ek bhashaa ek samskruti jaisi soch ne tamaam tarah kii vividhtaon ko kuchal diya to kahin in vividhtaon ne is vichaardhaara ke khilaaf sangharsh karte hue khud ko bachaae bhi rakhaa
 Many people say that the soldier who gives life in Siachen, is it allowed to shout slogans for Afzal Guru
 lekin kya isi desh main jantar mantar par van rank van pension kii maang kar rahe sainikon ke kurte nahin phaade gaye
 The medals were not drawn
 sainikon kii chintaa he to jantar mantar par sainik maheenon baad bhi kyon baithe hai
 Are they traitors? kuch ne kaha ki taxpere ke paise se jeenyu kyon chale
 Such absurd arguments also say that students of iits, AIIMS and iims study on tax payer's money and leave the country service and go to work abroad
 tex rashtrawaad ne kyon nahin awaz uthaai ki bank or udyongon ke lakhon karod rupee ke karj kyon maaf ho rahe hai or garib kisaanon ke kyon nahin
 Obviously, the argument of tax nationalism is anti-poor
 iconomik times main aaj swaminathan es ankalesaria ayyar ne ek lekh likhaa he
 The article says that anti-nationalism is just an abuse, it has no place in a free society
 unhone ek misaal di he
 1933 was the year when the Oxford University Students' Union debated that this House would not fight for the king or the country under any circumstances
 prastaav paas ho gaya or puure britain main khalabali much gai
 The students were severely criticized but no one was arrested in the sedition case
 scottish neshnal party britain se alag hona chaahati he
 If they want to build their Scottish nation, should their leaders be arrested for treason
 aisa to hua nahin
 Iyer has given many such examples
 tippaniyan The process of the formation of a nation in the world map has not yet been completed
 kahin raashtra tabah ho rahe hai to kahin bikhar bhi rahe hai
 Every year a new flag is made, and somewhere the old one is disappearing
 jeenyu kii ghatana ke baad bijepi or sangh is baat ko logon ko tak pahunchane main safal rahe ki rashtravirohi naaron ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Whoever spoke of breaking India was even asked to shoot
 kanoon adaalat kaa koi lihaaz nahin
 Nationalism is not a license to take up law
 assam main hi bodo alag rajya kii maang karte rahe hai lekin unke ek gut ke saath congress ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 In this country, there has been bloodshed about the demand for Khalistan
 kya ram jethmalani ne indira gandhi kii hatya se jude logon kaa mukadmaa nahin ladaa tha
 Did BJP not make Jethmalani a member of Rajya Sabha? party main shaamil nahin kiya
 Who does not know what the PDP is about Afzal Guru
 unke saath kisne sarkaar banaai koun nahin jaanata
 The problem is that when it comes to reading history, you and we make fun of history
 phir jab raajnneeti kerani hoti he to itihaas kii anaap shanaap vyakhyaayein karne lagate hai
 Currently, the political use of nationalism is creating a new understanding of nationalism, or an absurd version of what has happened many times before
 yah khataranaak pravriti he yaa log aise khataron se nipatane main sakasham hai
 The party that is in power, it makes your eyes ache on the strength of the police
 meri raay main raajnneetik dalon ke paas rashtrawaad kii antim paribhaasha nahin hoti he na honi chahie
 i said that political parties have the ultimate definition of nationalism when they intend to abolish democracy
 kya kabhi aapane dekha he ki raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta kisi niti, ghatana or ghotaale ke vakt apane hi dal ke khilaaf naare laga rahe hon ki unke liye dal nahin desh mahatvapurn he
 If this had happened, before the BJP, Congress workers would have come on the streets against the 2G scam
 aisa hota to bijepi ke kaaryakarta, netaa vyapam ghotaale par party se istipha de dete
 When the country was eating 200 rupees a pulse, they would protest against their own government
 kerala main aresas kaaryakarta pi
 V
 sujith kii hatya kar di gai
 Would you expect the Congress, CPM leaders to hit the road against this murder scandal
 kya aap ummid karenge ki bijepi ke sabhi netaa apane hi netaa o
 P
 sharma ke khilaaf sadak par utrenge
 Leave the condemnation blasphemous isliye dalon kii raajnneeti dalon ke hit ke liye hoti he
 You will find history of violence in the government of every political party
 aap har ghatana ko rashtrawaad ke chashme se nahin dekh sakate
 If the riots did not take place in the government of which party and which party has not been named, would you call them traitors or anti-nationals
 main yah nahin kah rahaa he ki raajnneetik dal ke log deshbhakt nahin hote
 Exactly
 har dal apni soch ke hisaab se desh ko sajaane sanvaare kii kalpana karata he
 But when attempting to define nationalism in the name of religion, race, color, language and even tax, it is not intended to be nationalism
 uskaa iraadaa kuch or hota he
 To make our monopoly work in the name of nationalism
 har daleel ko chup kara dena
 Where the party and the leader walk
 baaki sab uske ishaare par chalate hai
 Why have the slogans of India breaking and ruining India not yet identified in JNU
 kyon sutron ke hawaale se khabaren aa rahi hai
 Everyone has opposed them
 jeenyu ke tamaam chaatro or shikshakon ne bhi
 Their protest is against the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar against whom no evidence of treason has been found so far
 dilli police kahati he ki ab agar wo zamaanat ke liye applai karegaa to virodh nahin karenge
 He is a young man, he may be given a second chance
 is hriday parivartan se pehle gali gali main raily kar jeenyu ko badnaam kiya gaya ki vahaan rashtravirohi tatv padhate hai
 What happened in Patiala House Court on the second day as well
 kya koi bheed haath main tirangaa lekar khadi ho jaaegi to wo hamase aapse zyaada deshbhakt ho jaaegi
 Will people be scared with the tricolor and be denied the right to justice? supreme court kii naaraazgi ke baad bhi duusare din kanhaiya kumaar ke saath marpet kii koshish hui
 The lawyers who were allowed by the Supreme Court to go inside the court said that they were abused
 bhay kaa maahaul he
 The Supreme Court intervened and halted the hearing and vacated the court room
 kanhaiya kumaar ko 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 The lawyers of Tis Hazari Court have said that if any lawyer is arrested in the Patiala court case, then Delhi Police will be opposed
 dilli ke tamaam baar sangh hadtaal par jane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 There was no hearing, the verdict did not come but channels and lawyers and organizations declared terrorist
 agar aisi hi bheed aapako uthaa le jaae or haath main tirangaa lekar ghoshit kar de ki aatankwaadi hai or maar de to aap insaaf ke liye kahaan jaaenge
 All this has happened in history
 rashtravirohi bataakar raajnneetik virodhiyon kii hatyaein hui hai
 Six million Jews were burnt in a gas furnace in Germany
 ye rashtrawaad ke apane khatare hai
 These dangers should always be talked about when and when people are busy in appreciating the merits of nationalism
 kolkata kii jadhavpur university main bhi kuch chaatro ne azaadi ke naare lagaae or afzal guru kaa samarthan kiya
 They are being described as Radical Group
 ek chaatr ne safai di ki hamane abhivyakti kii azaadi ke sandarbh main azaadi kaa naaraa lagaaya to ek chaatra ne kaha ki usne kashmir kii azaadi or afzal guru ke liye naare lagaae hai
 How can my slogans be anti-national because BJP has formed a government by joining PDP and Afzal Guru is a martyr for PDP
 kai chaatro ne aisi soch kaa virodh kiya he or tamaam sanghathanon ne ninda kii he
 The VC of Jadhavpur University has said that the people who raised slogans were not students of the university, there were anti-social elements from outside
 vaais chancelar ne kaha he ki asamaajik tatwon kii harakat kii vajah se chaatro ke loktantric adhikaar ko nahin chhinana chahie
 There is a different understanding of treason on the page of the law and different in the minds of the public
 itihaas kii kitabon main rashtrawaad ko lekar anant vyakhyaayein hai
 First, there is a difference of miles between both nationalism and patriotism
 ek jatil masale kaa agar ham baat-baat main raajnneetik istamaal karenge to aap darshakon ko rashtravaadi hone se pehle itihaas kii das bees kitaaben pard leni chahie
 Tagore, who wrote the national anthem, called nationalism a unity policy of dragon snakes
 is tarah ke udaahranon se bhi hamaari samaj saaf nahin hoti he
 But nationalism has also been called the refuge of high spirits and people have also made supreme sacrifices for nationalism
 jeenyu main prophessoron ne rashtrawaad par agle ek hafte tak saarvajanik class lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 This class will start from five o'clock
 buudhvaar ko professor gopal guru ne hazaron chaatro ke bich pehali class lee
 What is Topic Tha Nation
 iske baad professor ji arunima, tanika sarkaar, nivedita menon, aaysha kidawai, achin vinayak kaa rashtrawaad par lacture hoga
 You will only get this quality in JNU
 meri taraf se do guzarish he
 One, that if it can be open class, then it should be in Hindi and second, in this, professors associated with the RSS should also be called to give lectures on nationalism
 rashtrawaad 19veen sadi kii sabase taqatvar vichaardhaara rahi he jisane ham insaanon ko hameshaa hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 One nation, one language, one culture and one kind of thinking crushed all the diversities, but somewhere these variations kept fighting against this ideology and kept themselves safe
 kai log kehete hai ki siachin main jaan dene vaale sainik ko kya yah chhot he ki wo afjal guru ke liye naare lagaae
 But did not the kurtas of soldiers demanding One Rank One Pension were torn off at Jantar Mantar in this country
 medal nahin khinche gaye
 The soldiers are worried, so why are the soldiers sitting at Jantar Mantar even after months
 kya ve deshadrohi hai
 Some asked why JNU moved with taxpayer money
 is tarah kii betuki daleel dene vaale yah bhi kehete hai ki iaiti, ames or im ke chaatr tex peyar ke paise par padhate hai or desh seva chhod videsh naukari karne chale jate hai
 Why tax nationalism did not raise the voice of why millions of crores of rupees loans of banks and industries are being waived and why poor farmers are not
 zaahir he tex rashtrawaad kii daleel garib virdohi he
 Swaminathan S
 Anklesaria Iyer has written an article in The Economic Times today
 lekh kaa unvaan he ki rashtrawaad virdohi mahaz ek gaali he, ek mukt samaaj main isaki koi jagah nahin
 He has given an example
 1933 kaa saal tha jab oxford uniwarsity ke chaatr sangh main is baat par bahes hui ki yah sadan kisi bhi paristhiti main raja yaa desh ke liye nahin ladega
 The proposal passed and there was a panic across Britain
 chaatro kii jamkar aalochana hui lekin kisi ko deshadroh ke maamle main giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 The Scottish National Party wants to secede from Britain
 apana scottish raashtra bananaa chaahati he to kya unke netaaon ko deshadroh ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya jaae
 This has not happened
 ayyar ne is tarah ke kai udhaaharan diye hai
 The comments duniya ke nakshe main raashtra ke banane kii prakriya abhi bhi mukammal nahin hui he
 Somewhere nations are being destroyed, and elsewhere they are disintegrating
 har saal kahin nayaa jhanda banataa he to kahin purana gaayab ho ja rahaa he
 After the JNU incident, the BJP and the Sangh were able to convey to the people that anti-national slogans would not be tolerated
 jo bharat ko todane kii baat karegaa use goli maar dene kii baat tak kahi gai
 Law courts have no consideration
 rashtrawaad kanoon haath main lene kaa license nahin he
 In Assam itself, the Bodos have been demanding a separate state, but the Congress contested together with one of their factions
 isi desh main agal khalistaan kii maang ko lekar koon kharaba ho chukaa he
 Had Ram Jethmalani not fought the case of those involved in the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 kya jethmalani ko bijepi ne rajya sabha kaa sadsy nahin banaaya
 Did not attend the party
 pidipi kii afzal guru ke bare main kya raay he koun nahin jaanata
 Who did not know who formed the government with them
 dikkat ye he ki jab itihaas padhane kii baari aati he to aap or ham itihaas kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Then when politics has to be done, then it begins to explain the mystery of history
 maujuuda samay main rashtrawaad kaa raajnneetik istemaal rashtrawaad kii koi nai samaj paidaa kar rahaa he yaa jo pehle kai baar ho chukaa he usee kaa betuka sanskaran he
 This is a dangerous trend or people are able to deal with such threats
 kya kabhi aapane dekha he ki raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta kisi niti, ghatana or ghotaale ke vakt apane hi dal ke khilaaf naare laga rahe hon ki unke liye dal nahin desh mahatvapurn he
 If this had happened, before the BJP, Congress workers would have come on the streets against the 2G scam
 aisa hota to bijepi ke kaaryakarta, netaa vyapam ghotaale par party se istipha de dete

 kyon sutron ke hawaale se khabaren aa rahi hai
 Everyone has opposed them
 jeenyu ke tamaam chaatro or shikshakon ne bhi
 Their protest is against the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar against whom no evidence of treason has been found so far
 dilli police kahati he ki ab agar wo zamaanat ke liye applai karegaa to virodh nahin karenge
 He is a young man, he may be given a second chance
 is hriday parivartan se pehle gali gali main raily kar jeenyu ko badnaam kiya gaya ki vahaan rashtravirohi tatv padhate hai
 What happened in Patiala House Court on the second day as well
 kya koi bheed haath main tirangaa lekar khadi ho jaaegi to wo hamase aapse zyaada deshbhakt ho jaaegi
 Will people be scared with the tricolor and be denied the right to justice? supreme court kii naaraazgi ke baad bhi duusare din kanhaiya kumaar ke saath marpet kii koshish hui
 The lawyers who were allowed by the Supreme Court to go inside the court said that they were abused
 bhay kaa maahaul he
 The Supreme Court intervened and halted the hearing and vacated the court room
 kanhaiya kumaar ko 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 The lawyers of Tis Hazari Court have said that if any lawyer is arrested in the Patiala court case, then Delhi Police will be opposed
 dilli ke tamaam baar sangh hadtaal par jane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 There was no hearing, the verdict did not come but channels and lawyers and organizations declared terrorist
 agar aisi hi bheed aapako uthaa le jaae or haath main tirangaa lekar ghoshit kar de ki aatankwaadi hai or maar de to aap insaaf ke liye kahaan jaaenge
 All this has happened in history
 rashtravirohi bataakar raajnneetik virodhiyon kii hatyaein hui hai
 Six million Jews were burnt in a gas furnace in Germany
 ye rashtrawaad ke apane khatare hai
 These dangers should always be talked about when and when people are busy in appreciating the merits of nationalism
 kolkata kii jadhavpur university main bhi kuch chaatro ne azaadi ke naare lagaae or afzal guru kaa samarthan kiya
 They are being described as Radical Group
 ek chaatr ne safai di ki hamane abhivyakti kii azaadi ke sandarbh main azaadi kaa naaraa lagaaya to ek chaatra ne kaha ki usne kashmir kii azaadi or afzal guru ke liye naare lagaae hai
 How can my slogans be anti-national because BJP has formed a government by joining PDP and Afzal Guru is a martyr for PDP
 kai chaatro ne aisi soch kaa virodh kiya he or tamaam sanghathanon ne ninda kii he
 The VC of Jadhavpur University has said that the people who raised slogans were not students of the university, there were anti-social elements from outside
 vaais chancelar ne kaha he ki asamaajik tatwon kii harakat kii vajah se chaatro ke loktantric adhikaar ko nahin chhinana chahie
 There is a different understanding of treason on the page of the law and different in the minds of the public
 itihaas kii kitabon main rashtrawaad ko lekar anant vyakhyaayein hai
 First, there is a difference of miles between both nationalism and patriotism
 ek jatil masale kaa agar ham baat-baat main raajnneetik istamaal karenge to aap darshakon ko rashtravaadi hone se pehle itihaas kii das bees kitaaben pard leni chahie
 Tagore, who wrote the national anthem, called nationalism a unity policy of dragon snakes
 is tarah ke udaahranon se bhi hamaari samaj saaf nahin hoti he
 But nationalism has also been called the refuge of high spirits and people have also made supreme sacrifices for nationalism
 jeenyu main prophessoron ne rashtrawaad par agle ek hafte tak saarvajanik class lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 This class will start from five o'clock
 buudhvaar ko professor gopal guru ne hazaron chaatro ke bich pehali class lee
 What is Topic Tha Nation
 iske baad professor ji arunima, tanika sarkaar, nivedita menon, aaysha kidawai, achin vinayak kaa rashtrawaad par lacture hoga
 You will only get this quality in JNU
 meri taraf se do guzarish he
 One, that if it can be open class, then it should be in Hindi and second, in this, professors associated with the RSS should also be called to give lectures on nationalism
 rashtrawaad 19veen sadi kii sabase taqatvar vichaardhaara rahi he jisane ham insaanon ko hameshaa hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 One nation, one language, one culture and one kind of thinking crushed all the diversities, but somewhere these variations kept fighting against this ideology and kept themselves safe
 kai log kehete hai ki siachin main jaan dene vaale sainik ko kya yah chhot he ki wo afjal guru ke liye naare lagaae
 But did not the kurtas of soldiers demanding One Rank One Pension were torn off at Jantar Mantar in this country
 medal nahin khinche gaye
 The soldiers are worried, so why are the soldiers sitting at Jantar Mantar even after months
 kya ve deshadrohi hai
 Some asked why JNU moved with taxpayer money
 is tarah kii betuki daleel dene vaale yah bhi kehete hai ki iaiti, ames or im ke chaatr tex peyar ke paise par padhate hai or desh seva chhod videsh naukari karne chale jate hai
 Why tax nationalism did not raise the voice of why millions of crores of rupees loans of banks and industries are being waived and why poor farmers are not
 zaahir he tex rashtrawaad kii daleel garib virdohi he
 Swaminathan S
 Anklesaria Iyer has written an article in The Economic Times today
 lekh kaa unvaan he ki rashtrawaad virdohi mahaz ek gaali he, ek mukt samaaj main isaki koi jagah nahin
 He has given an example
 1933 kaa saal tha jab oxford uniwarsity ke chaatr sangh main is baat par bahes hui ki yah sadan kisi bhi paristhiti main raja yaa desh ke liye nahin ladega
 The proposal passed and there was a panic across Britain
 chaatro kii jamkar aalochana hui lekin kisi ko deshadroh ke maamle main giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 The Scottish National Party wants to secede from Britain
 apana scottish raashtra bananaa chaahati he to kya unke netaaon ko deshadroh ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya jaae
 This has not happened
 ayyar ne is tarah ke kai udhaaharan diye hai
 The comments duniya ke nakshe main raashtra ke banane kii prakriya abhi bhi mukammal nahin hui he
 Somewhere nations are being destroyed, and elsewhere they are disintegrating
 har saal kahin nayaa jhanda banataa he to kahin purana gaayab ho ja rahaa he
 After the JNU incident, the BJP and the Sangh were able to convey to the people that anti-national slogans would not be tolerated
 jo bharat ko todane kii baat karegaa use goli maar dene kii baat tak kahi gai
 Law courts have no consideration
 rashtrawaad kanoon haath main lene kaa license nahin he
 In Assam itself, the Bodos have been demanding a separate state, but the Congress contested together with one of their factions
 isi desh main agal khalistaan kii maang ko lekar koon kharaba ho chukaa he
 Had Ram Jethmalani not fought the case of those involved in the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 kya jethmalani ko bijepi ne rajya sabha kaa sadsy nahin banaaya
 Did not attend the party
 pidipi kii afzal guru ke bare main kya raay he koun nahin jaanata
 Who did not know who formed the government with them
 dikkat ye he ki jab itihaas padhane kii baari aati he to aap or ham itihaas kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Then when politics has to be done, then it begins to explain the mystery of history
 maujuuda samay main rashtrawaad kaa raajnneetik istemaal rashtrawaad kii koi nai samaj paidaa kar rahaa he yaa jo pehle kai baar ho chukaa he usee kaa betuka sanskaran he
 This is a dangerous trend or people are able to deal with such threats
 main yah nahin kah rahaa he ki raajnneetik dal ke log deshbhakt nahin hote
 Exactly
 har dal apni soch ke hisaab se desh ko sajaane sanvaare kii kalpana karata he
 But when attempting to define nationalism in the name of religion, race, color, language and even tax, it is not intended to be nationalism
 uskaa iraadaa kuch or hota he
 To make our monopoly work in the name of nationalism
 har daleel ko chup kara dena
 Where the party and the leader walk
 baaki sab uske ishaare par chalate hai

 One student clarified that we raised the slogan of freedom in the context of freedom of expression, one student said that he has raised slogans for the freedom of Kashmir and Afzal Guru

 rashtravirohi bataakar raajnneetik virodhiyon kii hatyaein hui hai
 Six million Jews were burnt in a gas furnace in Germany
 ye rashtrawaad ke apane khatare hai
 These dangers should always be talked about when and when people are busy in appreciating the merits of nationalism
 kolkata kii jadhavpur university main bhi kuch chaatro ne azaadi ke naare lagaae or afzal guru kaa samarthan kiya
 They are being described as Radical Group
 ek chaatr ne safai di ki hamane abhivyakti kii azaadi ke sandarbh main azaadi kaa naaraa lagaaya to ek chaatra ne kaha ki usne kashmir kii azaadi or afzal guru ke liye naare lagaae hai
 How can my slogans be anti-national because BJP has formed a government by joining PDP and Afzal Guru is a martyr for PDP
 kai chaatro ne aisi soch kaa virodh kiya he or tamaam sanghathanon ne ninda kii he
 The VC of Jadhavpur University has said that the people who raised slogans were not students of the university, there were anti-social elements from outside
 vaais chancelar ne kaha he ki asamaajik tatwon kii harakat kii vajah se chaatro ke loktantric adhikaar ko nahin chhinana chahie
 There is a different understanding of treason on the page of the law and different in the minds of the public
 itihaas kii kitabon main rashtrawaad ko lekar anant vyakhyaayein hai
 First, there is a difference of miles between both nationalism and patriotism
 ek jatil masale kaa agar ham baat-baat main raajnneetik istamaal karenge to aap darshakon ko rashtravaadi hone se pehle itihaas kii das bees kitaaben pard leni chahie
 Tagore, who wrote the national anthem, called nationalism a unity policy of dragon snakes
 is tarah ke udaahranon se bhi hamaari samaj saaf nahin hoti he
 But nationalism has also been called the refuge of high spirits and people have also made supreme sacrifices for nationalism
 jeenyu main prophessoron ne rashtrawaad par agle ek hafte tak saarvajanik class lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 This class will start from five o'clock
 buudhvaar ko professor gopal guru ne hazaron chaatro ke bich pehali class lee
 What is Topic Tha Nation
 iske baad professor ji arunima, tanika sarkaar, nivedita menon, aaysha kidawai, achin vinayak kaa rashtrawaad par lacture hoga
 You will only get this quality in JNU
 meri taraf se do guzarish he
 One, that if it can be open class, then it should be in Hindi and second, in this, professors associated with the RSS should also be called to give lectures on nationalism
 rashtrawaad 19veen sadi kii sabase taqatvar vichaardhaara rahi he jisane ham insaanon ko hameshaa hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 One nation, one language, one culture and one kind of thinking crushed all the diversities, but somewhere these variations kept fighting against this ideology and kept themselves safe
 kai log kehete hai ki siachin main jaan dene vaale sainik ko kya yah chhot he ki wo afjal guru ke liye naare lagaae
 But did not the kurtas of soldiers demanding One Rank One Pension were torn off at Jantar Mantar in this country
 medal nahin khinche gaye
 The soldiers are worried, so why are the soldiers sitting at Jantar Mantar even after months
 kya ve deshadrohi hai
 Some asked why JNU moved with taxpayer money
 is tarah kii betuki daleel dene vaale yah bhi kehete hai ki iaiti, ames or im ke chaatr tex peyar ke paise par padhate hai or desh seva chhod videsh naukari karne chale jate hai
 Why tax nationalism did not raise the voice of why millions of crores of rupees loans of banks and industries are being waived and why poor farmers are not
 zaahir he tex rashtrawaad kii daleel garib virdohi he
 Swaminathan S
 Anklesaria Iyer has written an article in The Economic Times today
 lekh kaa unvaan he ki rashtrawaad virdohi mahaz ek gaali he, ek mukt samaaj main isaki koi jagah nahin
 He has given an example
 1933 kaa saal tha jab oxford uniwarsity ke chaatr sangh main is baat par bahes hui ki yah sadan kisi bhi paristhiti main raja yaa desh ke liye nahin ladega
 The proposal passed and there was a panic across Britain
 chaatro kii jamkar aalochana hui lekin kisi ko deshadroh ke maamle main giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 The Scottish National Party wants to secede from Britain
 apana scottish raashtra bananaa chaahati he to kya unke netaaon ko deshadroh ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya jaae
 This has not happened
 ayyar ne is tarah ke kai udhaaharan diye hai
 The comments duniya ke nakshe main raashtra ke banane kii prakriya abhi bhi mukammal nahin hui he
 Somewhere nations are being destroyed, and elsewhere they are disintegrating
 har saal kahin nayaa jhanda banataa he to kahin purana gaayab ho ja rahaa he
 After the JNU incident, the BJP and the Sangh were able to convey to the people that anti-national slogans would not be tolerated
 jo bharat ko todane kii baat karegaa use goli maar dene kii baat tak kahi gai
 Law courts have no consideration
 rashtrawaad kanoon haath main lene kaa license nahin he
 In Assam itself, the Bodos have been demanding a separate state, but the Congress contested together with one of their factions
 isi desh main agal khalistaan kii maang ko lekar koon kharaba ho chukaa he
 Had Ram Jethmalani not fought the case of those involved in the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 kya jethmalani ko bijepi ne rajya sabha kaa sadsy nahin banaaya
 Did not attend the party
 pidipi kii afzal guru ke bare main kya raay he koun nahin jaanata
 Who did not know who formed the government with them
 dikkat ye he ki jab itihaas padhane kii baari aati he to aap or ham itihaas kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Then when politics has to be done, then it begins to explain the mystery of history
 maujuuda samay main rashtrawaad kaa raajnneetik istemaal rashtrawaad kii koi nai samaj paidaa kar rahaa he yaa jo pehle kai baar ho chukaa he usee kaa betuka sanskaran he
 This is a dangerous trend or people are able to deal with such threats
 kolkata kii jadhavpur university main bhi kuch chaatro ne azaadi ke naare lagaae or afzal guru kaa samarthan kiya
