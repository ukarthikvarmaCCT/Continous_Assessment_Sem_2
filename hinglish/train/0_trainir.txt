 In this sense, this time flood has destroyed the palace huts of 400 crores
 bhagalpur kaa srijan ghotaalaa, jisamen naukarshahon or netaaon ne milakar 700 karod kaa gaban kiya he, wo bhi samajhiye baadh main hi bah gaya
 Investigation will continue, it will take many years only to prove the blame
 point yah he ki agar is tarah kaa ek ghotaalaa roak diya jaae to bihar ke das lakh logon ko sarkaar 30 se 50 hazaar rupee jhopadi banane ke liye de sakati he
 If you add the amount of potato-sand scam, money can be distributed to the poor people with both hands without accounting
 magar janata ko miltaa he bhaashan
 In the flood, along with the hut, the goods kept in it also flow away
 ek choti se paan kii dukaan main 25,000 rupee tak kaa saamaan hota he
 The shop of groceries carries goods of 50 to one lakh
 do quintal chaaval hi baha hoga to vahi das hazaar kaa ho jaataa he
 All these figures are not there in the book according to the devastation of the flood
 isi tarah hamen akhabaaron or tivi kii satahi report se pataa chalata he ki hazaron kii sankhya main maveshi bah gaye
 But we do not know what it means to be swept away
 ek bhens kii keemat 40,000 rupee hoti he
 a cow costs 30,000
 narptganj ilaaka he, vahaan kaha ja rahaa he ki ek basti ke hazaar se zyaada maveshi bah kar mar gaye hai
 In a colony, buffaloes or cows of 4 to 5 crores died or were swept away
 kitne karod kii bakriyaan bah gayi hongi, unka hi hisaab nahin he
 a goat costs five thousand
 kya aapako sarkaar ne bataaya ki baadh se garib janata kii itane karod kii puunji barbaad ho gai he or sarkaar isaki bharpai karne vaali he kyonki uskaa kaam janata kii seva ke alaava kuch bhi nahin he
 We did not add waste to crops in this regard
 chaare kii barbaadi nahin jodi
 Did not add waste to all types of machines from tractors
 puri kaa puri gramin arthvyavastha tabah ho gai he
 Poor and poor sarkaron ko ham tivi or akhbaar waalon kii satahi reporting kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie kyonki hamaari vajah se baadh kii tabaahi kaa asli manzar kabhi janata ke saamne nahin aata he
 The floods are not just in the 18 districts of Bihar
 assam ke 33 zile kai hafton se baadh kii chapet main hai
 In Assam, 3
4 million people are affected by floods
 mukhyamantri ne pradhanmantri ko bataaya he ki fasalein bhi barbaad hui hai or ghar bhi tabah hue hai
 The Prime Minister had announced a fund of 100 crore for studies on the Brahmaputra and tributaries to find solutions to the floods
 assam ke kajiranga main 25 jaanavar bhi mar gaye
 The death toll has crossed 150
 baadh kaa pani ghat to rahaa he magar pani ke hatane se barbaadi kaa str bada hota ja rahaa he kyonki kya barbaad hua he pani hatane ke baad hi dikh rahaa he
 Six districts of North Bengal have also been flooded
 yahaan bhi baadh se 55 logon ke marane kii khabar he
 There are floods in 24 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan bhi marane waalon kii sankhya 69 ho chuki he
 More than 500 people have died in floods in four states
 karodon log visthapit hai
 It is not that governments are not trying through relief camps, they are doing it at all
 wo kaam bhi apni khaamiyon or chunautiyon ke bich chal hi rahaa he
 But flood is not just relief and rescue work
 'down tu arth' akeli patrika he jisane baadh aane se pehle baadh kii khabar lee
 The flood story was featured on the cover of its Hindi edition in the month of July
 down tu arth patrika ab hindi main bhi aati he
 Archana Yadav traveled from Patna to Farakka in Bengal and tried to know what are the causes of Bihar floods and what is the solution
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki bihar ke adhikariyon mantriyon ne baadh ko lekar july main koi baithak kii thi yaa nahin
 i want to put some key parts of what is in Down to Earth magazine here
 1950 ke dashak main bengal ke farkka main jab bairaj ban rahaa tha tabhi us vakt ek ejeeniyar kapil bhattacharya ne kaha tha ki Due to Farakka, Patna, Barauni, Munger, Bhagalpur and Purnia of Bihar will submerge in water every year along with Malda and Murshidabad in Bengal
 farkka bairaj se paidaa hui rukawat ke kaaran ganga kii gati dhimi ho jaaegi or pani main bahakar ai gaad ganga ke tal main jamane lagegi
 Due to which the Ganges will start becoming shallow
 jaise jaise ganga uthali hogi, vaise-baise uskaa baadh kaa prabhaav kshetra bhi badhege
 The comments bihar ke kisi bhi ilaake main jaaiye log nadiyon ko lekar apane anubhav bataate hai, un tamaam anubhavon main gaad kaa bharna pramukh kaaran aa jaataa he
 We tied rivers less with embankments, opened up new avenues of waste
 baadh kii tabaahi barish ke pani se nahin aati he, nitiyon ke kaaran aati he
 These people also know, but not always knowing all the way
 1950 ke dashak ke kapil bhattacharya kii ashanka kii pushti haal main ganga ke ilaake kaa hawaii survey karne vaaleiiti ke professor rajeev sinha karte hai
 Whose statement is printed in Down to Earth that the deposition of silt is really too much
 yah avishwasaneey he
 Sinha is a member of the expert team constituted by the Bihar government to study the flood problem
 iske baad archana machuaaron kii basti main jaati hai, vahaan bhi vahi baat kahi jaati he ki pehle ganga pachaas se saath haath gahari hoti thi ab aath se das haath gahari he
 That is, from 1950 to 2017, the same opinion emerges
 archana ne jab kendriya jal ayog, ganga baadh niyantran ayog, kendriya jal sansaadhan mantralay se baat kerani chaahi to kisi ne baat nahin kii
 Everyone knows why answer the question when the vote is received
 yahi nahin pehle baadh aati thi to pani kuch dinon main chalaa jaataa tha, ab baadh kaa pani kai dinon tak mehmaan banakar rahata he
 It has also affected farming
 gaad bharne se ganga kii assi fisadi machhliyaan samaapt ho gayi hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's statement is that a state like Bihar has to spend 1000 crores only to prevent the immediate impact of land erosion and floods
 gaad ko hataanaa ab sambhav nahin he
 Keep it away, where it has become a big challenge
 baadh main jhopadi ke saath-saath usamen rakhaa saamaan bhi bah jaataa he
 a small paan shop carries goods up to Rs 25,000
 parchun kii dukaan main 50 se ek lakh kaa saamaan hota he
 If two quintals of rice are shed, then it becomes ten thousand
 baadh kii tabaahi ke hisaab-kitaab main ye sab aankade nahin hote hai
 Similarly, we find from the surface reports of newspapers and TV that thousands of cattle were swept away
 lekin hamen pataa nahin chalata ki unke bah jane kaa matlab kya he
 a buffalo costs Rs 40,000
 ek gaay kii keemat hoti he 30,000
 In the Narpatganj area, it is said that more than a thousand cattle have died from a settlement
 ek basti me 4 se 5 karod kii bhens yaa gaayen mar gayi yaa bah gayi
 The amount of crores of goats must have been washed away, it is not accounted for
 ek bakrii kii keemat paanch hazaar hoti he
 Did the government tell you that so many crores of capital have been wasted by the poor people due to the flood and the government is going to compensate it because its work is nothing but public service
 hamane is hisaab main fasalon kii barbaadi nahin jodi
 Did not add waste to fodder tractor se lekar tamaam tarah kii mashiinon kii barbaadi nahin jodi
 The entire rural economy has been devastated
 garib or garib ho gaye
 Governments should thank the superficial reporting of us TV and newspaper people because the real vision of the devastation of floods never comes before the public because of us
 baadh sirf bihar ke 18 zilon main nahin he
 33 districts of Assam have been in floods for several weeks
 assam main 34 lakh log baadh se prabhavit hai
 The Chief Minister has told the Prime Minister that crops have also been destroyed and houses have also been destroyed
 pradhanmantri ne baadh kaa samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye brahmaputra or sahaayak nadiyon par adhyayan ke liye 100 karod kaa fund dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 25 animals also died in Kaziranga, Assam
 yahaan marane vaale logon kii sankhya 150 ke paar ja chuki he
 Flood water is decreasing, but the level of waste is increasing due to the removal of water, because what is ruined is visible only after the water is removed
 uttari bengal ke chah zilon main bhi baadh ai hui he
 Here also 55 people are reported to have died due to floods
 poorabi uttar pradesh ke 24 zilon main baadh ai hui he
 The death toll has also reached 69 here
 chaar rajyon kii baadh main 500 se adhik log mar gaye hai
 Millions of people are displaced
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein raahat shiviron ke zariye prayaas nahin kar rahi hai, bilkul kar rahi hai
 That work is going on in the midst of its flaws and challenges
 magar baadh sirf raahat or bachaav kaary nahin he
 'down to Earth' is the only magazine that reported the flood before the flood
 iske hindi sanskaran ke july maheene ke ank ke cover par baadh kii story chhapi thi
 Down to Earth magazine now also comes in Hindi
 archana yadav ne patna se bengal ke farkka tak yatra kar jaanane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki bihar kii baadh ke kya kaaran hai or upaay kya he
 i do not know if the Bihar ministers had any meeting in July about the floods
 down tu arth patrika main jo baaten hai unke kuch pramukh hisse ko yahaan rakhana chahta hum
 In the 1950s when a barrage was being built in Farakka, Bengal, at that time an engineer Kapil Bhattacharya said that farkka ke kaaran bengal ke malda va murshidaabad ke saath bihar ke patna, barauni, munger, bhagalpur or purniya har saal pani main duumbenge
 Due to the blockage caused by the Farakka barrage, the speed of the Ganges will slow down and the silt flowing into the water will start settling in the Ganga floor
 jisase ganga uthali hone lagegi
 As the Ganges becomes shallow, its flood effect area will also increase
 tippaniyan Go to any area of bihar, people tell their experiences about rivers, in all those experiences, silt filling is the main reason
 tatbandhon se hamane nadiyon ko baandha kam, barbaadi ke nae-nae raste zyaada khol liye
 The devastation of floods does not come from rain water, due to policies
 ye bhi log jaanate hai magar hameshaa ki tarah se jaanane se hi sab nahin ho jaataa
 Kapil Bhattacharya's fears of the 1950s are confirmed by IIT professor Rajiv Sinha, who recently conducted an aerial survey of the Ganges area
 jinka bayaan down tu arth main chapa he ki gaad kaa jamaav sachmuch main bahut zyada he
 this is incredible
 sinha baadh kii samasya kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bihar sarkaar dwaara gathit visheshgy dal ke sadsy hai
 After this, Archana goes to the fishermen's colony, the same thing is said that earlier Ganga was fifty to sixty cubits deep, now eight to ten cubits deep
 yani 1950 se lekar 2017 tak ek hi raay ubhar kar saamne aati he
 When Archana wanted to talk to the Central Water Commission, Ganga Flood Control Commission, Union Water Resources Ministry, no one spoke
 sabko pataa he ki jab vot mil hi jaataa he to sawaal kaa jawaab kyon den
 Not only this, before the flood, the water used to go away in a few days, now the flood water remains as a guest for many days
 iskaa asar kheti par bhi padaa he
 Eighty percent of the Ganges fishes have died due to silt filling
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa bayaan he ki bihar jaise rajya ko zamin ke kataav or baadh ke tatkaal prabhaav ko rokane par hi 1000 karod kharch karnaa padataa he
 It is no longer possible to remove silt
 hataakar rakhenge kahaan ye badi chunauti ho gai he
 We did not add waste to crops in this regard
 chaare kii barbaadi nahin jodi
 Did not add waste to all types of machines from tractors
 puri kaa puri gramin arthvyavastha tabah ho gai he
 Poor and poor sarkaron ko ham tivi or akhbaar waalon kii satahi reporting kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie kyonki hamaari vajah se baadh kii tabaahi kaa asli manzar kabhi janata ke saamne nahin aata he
 The floods are not just in the 18 districts of Bihar
 assam ke 33 zile kai hafton se baadh kii chapet main hai
 In Assam, 3
4 million people are affected by floods
 mukhyamantri ne pradhanmantri ko bataaya he ki fasalein bhi barbaad hui hai or ghar bhi tabah hue hai
 The Prime Minister had announced a fund of 100 crore for studies on the Brahmaputra and tributaries to find solutions to the floods
 assam ke kajiranga main 25 jaanavar bhi mar gaye
 The death toll has crossed 150
 baadh kaa pani ghat to rahaa he magar pani ke hatane se barbaadi kaa str bada hota ja rahaa he kyonki kya barbaad hua he pani hatane ke baad hi dikh rahaa he
 Six districts of North Bengal have also been flooded
 yahaan bhi baadh se 55 logon ke marane kii khabar he
 There are floods in 24 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan bhi marane waalon kii sankhya 69 ho chuki he
 More than 500 people have died in floods in four states
 karodon log visthapit hai
 It is not that governments are not trying through relief camps, they are doing it at all
 wo kaam bhi apni khaamiyon or chunautiyon ke bich chal hi rahaa he
 But flood is not just relief and rescue work
 'down tu arth' akeli patrika he jisane baadh aane se pehle baadh kii khabar lee
 The flood story was featured on the cover of its Hindi edition in the month of July
 down tu arth patrika ab hindi main bhi aati he
 Archana Yadav traveled from Patna to Farakka in Bengal and tried to know what are the causes of Bihar floods and what is the solution
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki bihar ke adhikariyon mantriyon ne baadh ko lekar july main koi baithak kii thi yaa nahin
 i want to put some key parts of what is in Down to Earth magazine here
 1950 ke dashak main bengal ke farkka main jab bairaj ban rahaa tha tabhi us vakt ek ejeeniyar kapil bhattacharya ne kaha tha ki Due to Farakka, Patna, Barauni, Munger, Bhagalpur and Purnia of Bihar will submerge in water every year along with Malda and Murshidabad in Bengal
 farkka bairaj se paidaa hui rukawat ke kaaran ganga kii gati dhimi ho jaaegi or pani main bahakar ai gaad ganga ke tal main jamane lagegi
 Due to which the Ganges will start becoming shallow
 jaise jaise ganga uthali hogi, vaise-baise uskaa baadh kaa prabhaav kshetra bhi badhege
 The comments bihar ke kisi bhi ilaake main jaaiye log nadiyon ko lekar apane anubhav bataate hai, un tamaam anubhavon main gaad kaa bharna pramukh kaaran aa jaataa he
 We tied rivers less with embankments, opened up new avenues of waste
 baadh kii tabaahi barish ke pani se nahin aati he, nitiyon ke kaaran aati he
 These people also know, but not always knowing all the way
 1950 ke dashak ke kapil bhattacharya kii ashanka kii pushti haal main ganga ke ilaake kaa hawaii survey karne vaaleiiti ke professor rajeev sinha karte hai

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday alleged that due to weak policies of the UPA government, China and Pakistan are repeatedly daring to cross the border into Indian territory
 dashahra par salanaa raily ko sambodhit karte hue bhagwat ne kaha, ‘hamaari rashtriya suraksha par kaale badal mandara rahe hai kyonki china seemaa par baar-baar ghuspaith kar hamaare sanyam or dhary kii pariksha le rahaa he, iske alaava apane utpaada hamaare desh main bhar rahaa he
 He said, "china and Pakistan are infiltrating Indian territory repeatedly in which the latest attack was carried out by Pakistan on a police station and army camp in Jammu
" ’sarasanghachaalak ne daawa kiya, ‘jammu kashmir main kishtwar jile main pakistan ke samarthan main naaraa laga rahe ek samudaay ke logon ne kuch hindu kaarobaariyon par hamalaa kiya
 He also criticized Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's statement made before the European delegation, stating that the state was incorporated into India and not formally merged
 mohan bhagwat ne desh kii khasta aarthik sthiti ke liye centre main congress nit upie sarkaar kii nitiyon ko jimmedaar tehraaya or kaha ki aisi sthiti main bharat kaise aarthik mahashakti banegaa
 Without mentioning the populist schemes of the government, the Sarsanghchalak said, "the economy has stagnated due to fiscal deficit, current account deficit and depletion in foreign exchange reserves, along with clear indications of rapid growth in foreign debt vis-à-vis GDP
 It is found that our economic policies are wrong
 ’bhagwat ne kaha, ‘yah chintaa kaa vishay he ki hamen antarrashtriya bazaar main rupaye ke mulya main aa rahi giravat ko rokane kii jarurat pad rahi he
 He also attacked the instructions of Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde sent to the states in support of minorities
 uttar pradesh main ek baar phir asamanjas main 17 jatiyaanyogi sarkaar ne OBC se essi main kiya tha shamilhai court ne rajya sarkaar ke faisle par lagaai rokuttar pradesh main yogi adityanath sarkaar kii ore se obisi kii 17 jatiyon ko essi varg main shaamil karne ke faisle par elahabaad hai court ne roak laga di
 The High Court has sought an answer from the state government on this issue
 hai court ne yogi sarkaar se kaha ki pradesh sarkaar ko is tarah kaa faisla lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Only Parliament has the right to make changes in ST / SC castes
 uttar pradesh main in 17 jatiyon ko pichhadaa varg se anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kii koshishen pichley do dashak se hoti raheen hai
 The erstwhile BSP and Samajwadi Party governments have also tried this
 magar rajya sarkaar ke adhikaar se baahar jaakar faisla lene ke chalate iskaa kriyanvayan nahin ho sakaa
 Recently, the Yogi government issued a mandate on June 24, arranging for the re-inclusion of 17 castes from obcs into Scheduled Castes
 jilon ke dm ko anusuchit jati kaa praaanpatr jari karne kaa aadesh bhi de diya gaya
 But after the High Court has imposed a ban, now the case of these 17 castes has again been caught in the vortex
 is maamle kii hai court main sunwaayee ke dauraan justise sudhir agarwal or justise rajeev mishra kii divijan bench ne maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue ye aadesh diya he
 The court has considered the government's decision wrong
 court ne kaha ki is tarah ke faisle lene kaa adhikaar sarkaar ko nahin tha
 Who are the castes, the backward castes are Nishad, Bind, Mallah, Kewat, Kashyap, Bhar, Dhivar, Batham, Fisherman, Prajapati, Rajbhar, Kahar, Kumhar, Dhimar, Manjhi, Turaha, Gaur etc
 in pichhadi jatiyon ko ab essi category kii list main daalaa gaya tha
 The government had ordered the district officer to issue caste certificates to the families of these 17 castes, which has been stayed by the High Court

 While the Congress is moving towards a big defeat due to the resentment arising out of the division of the state
 tedepa ne 36 nagarpalikaon par, jabaki wiesarsipi ne 11 nagarpalikaon par jeet darj karai he

 The Supreme Court, while canceling the petition of farmers of 65 villages here, said that land will not be returned to the farmers
 supreme court ne elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 The farmers had said in their petition that the land acquisition in Greater Noida West was done illegally and permission was not taken from the NCR Planning Board
 vahiin athurity kii daleel thi ki ilaake ke vikaas ke liye zamin kharidi gai thi or kisaanon ke hiton kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa gaya he
 The comments pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan kisaan kii ore se daayar yachika par court ne apana faisalaa surakshit rakh liya tha

 The bench of Chief Justice HL Dattu rejected the plea of both the authorities in the case, saying that there was no need to interfere in the High Court's decision in the matter
 kisaanon ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki greater noida west main zamin adhigrahan gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se kiya gaya or iske liye ensiaar planning board se bhi anumati nahin lee gai
 At the same time, the authority argued that the land was purchased for the development of the area and the interests of the farmers have been taken full care of
 tippaniyan During the last hearing, the court reserved its decision on the petition filed by the farmer
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kisaanon ke vakeelon se sawaal kiya tha ki agar adhigrahan sambandhi notification galat tha, to unhone apil daakhil karne main deree kyon kii? saath hi is maamle main muaavja bhi le liya gaya or phir rit daakhil kar di gai

 It has been 70 years since Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose went missing
 ek baar phir netaji se sambandhit gopneey filein saarvajanik karne kii maang jor pakad rahi he
 This time, the descendants of Netaji, the families of the remaining soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and many civil organizations have taken initiative to pressurize the government through a hunger strike
 haalanki sarkaar ne saaf kar diya he ki kisi bhi surat main gopneey filein saarvajanik nahin kii ja saktin
 File related to the plane crash, such things were revealed that on 18 August 1945, Netaji was killed in the plane crash, but after that there is no news of the leader
 ab tak us haadase kii asaliyat sirf filon main darj he
 The demand to get this reality out of files and to the public continues till now
 tabhi to jantar-mantar par kramik bhukh hadtaal chal rahi he
 The name is Long March for Netaji
 
 
 isamen naagarik sanghathan bhi shaamil hai
 The demands of all the people including the descendants, also the descendants of the martyrs as well as the family of Netaji as nine and ten members of the fourth generation of involved in the Bhukhi strike
 maang vahi puraani ki netaji se sambandhit gopneey filein saarvajanik kii jaay
 Netaji's great-grandson Chandra Kumar Bose says, "the government has to make the files public
 piem modi ne kaha he ki ye to desh kaa kartavya he
 More than 100 files are with the central government and 64 files with the Bengal government
 netaji kii bhatiji kahati hai
 'our movement will continue
 sarkaar ko hamaari baat manani chaiye
 The government is adamant on itself
 'soochna ayog ne bhi kahahaal hi main mukhya soochna ayukta ne bhi centre sarkaar se kaha tha ki gopneey filon ko saarvajanik karne par apana rukh saaf karen
 The government reiterated that it cannot be done
 ab ye andolan kitna asardaar hoga kahana mushkil he
 But the motives of the agitators are also clear
 long march jari rahegalang march kii aayojak gopa ghosh kahati hai, 'chaahe do-chaar jaan chali jaaen lekin ye andolan rukegaa nahin jab tak kinetaji se sambandhit filanaarvajanik nahin ho jaatin
 There is also a plea of the government that by making the confidential files public, our relations with some countries will deteriorate
 to ab kashmakash ye he ki ek ore jan bhaavana or duusari ore videshi kootneeti
 See who wins in a tug of relationships and emotions
 kya aap kisi bhi samay acchhee kahaniyaan sunaane kii maharath rakhte hai? to shodhakartaaon ke mutabik aap badi teji se mahilaon kaa dil jeet sakate hai
 Women consider men to be more attractive and engaging who are good storytellers
 is shodh ke nishkarsho se pataa chalata he ki mahilaayein acchhee kahaniyaan sunaane vaale purushon ko adhik vaanchhneeya samajhati he or unhen dirghakaalik saathi ke rup main dekhati hai
 The research team found that the reason is that the man telling the stories knows how to connect, how to express emotions and possibly how to be vulnerable
 personal relationships naamak jarnal main prakashit is shodh main shodhakartaaon ne kaha he, "iske alaava, vah yah bhi sanket karata he ki vah dilachasp or mukhar he tathaa vah sansaadhan juta saktaa he or sambal ban saktaa he

 "comments kisi sambandh ko pragadh karne main sari raat baatcheet karnaa or kahaniyaan sunaanaa mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Researchers say that apart from telling stories to each other, it also helps you to remember why you were attracted to each other for the first time
 jis tareeke se log apni kahani kaa bunate hai vah unke shaareerik or maansik sehat par bhi gaharaa asar daalati he
 Apart from this, good memories of the past and the successes that they had achieved together that freshen up the memories also increase the bonding among the couples
 shodhadal ne paaya ki iskaa kaaran yah he ki kahaniyaan sunaane vaala purush jaanata he ki kaise judaa jaae, kaise bhaawanaaon kaa izhaar kiya jaae or sambhavat: kaise subhedya hua jaae
 In this research published in the journal Personal Relationships, the researchers stated, "in addition, he also indicates that he is interesting and assertive and that he can gather resources and become a support
 " Australian

 yah sunaanevaale ko shashakt banaata he ki use shrota kii sweekruti milti he

 Both players agreed to the draw after 46 moves

 Even after this, if you have the courage, then you know that in the meantime, suddenly the children have grown up with a clutch, it is also known that your biggest enemy is that you have kept a house in your house, it is the same that would have unnecessarily picked up on Sunday morning
 Is, anyway, on weekends, the world seems to be the enemy, no one should ask for a glass of water for life, but should sleep half an hour on Sunday morning, do not let all the universe's variable, macro-subtle ingredients work with you
 The moment comes, the atmosphere is made such that if you sleep even for a moment, the earth will stop moving and the planetary constellations will fall on your balcony
 chuttee ke din so paanaa bhi itnaa aasaan nahi hota, kai baar to isliye ki sote-sote peeth dukhane lagati he, or kai baar to is khatke ke chalate soya nahi jaataa ki zyada so lo to lagata he aukaat se zyada kharch kar rahe hai
 What was the point that the world seems to be an enemy to you also proves that, throughout the week, you should try to watch a special report on a film or news channel of Gurudutt because someone is running 'jodha-akbar' or 'ninja Hattori'
 
 lekin weekend par jab remote haath aayega to film ke naam par 'jigar kalejaa' or samachar main kamedi shoj kii jhalkiyaan dekhne ko hi milengi
 Even if the world falls behind you on the weekend, remove the old rivalries of the TV channels, do not stop the process of complaints and demands, the martyrs should also throw all these obstacles in the fire of their comfort and lacquer back dukh or body barbs of twelve Do not leave bed earlier

 The Assembly committee summoned the three MCD commissioners of Delhi on Wednesday

 The special thing of this meeting was that for the first time this committee held in front of media cameras so that no one could run away from responsibility

 This meeting was called because the work of notification of 351 roads has been stopped for the last 12 years, due to which the ceiling of the ceiling is hanging here and the Delhi government-mcd is blaming each other for this
 buudhvaar ko bulaai baithak main jab vidhansabha samiti kii adhyaksh bhaavana goud nedilli sarkaaraki shahari vikaas mantralay sachiv renu sharma se 351 sadakon ko notiphoi kiye jane ko lekar tazaa sthiti jaani to unhone bataaya, "emsidi ne proper survey nahin karvaa kar diya
 "on this MCD commissioners told the committee that the survey has been sent
 iske baad shahari vikaas mantralay kii sachiv ne bataaya ki survey mila to he lekin wo satyapit nahin he
 When the committee asked the commissioners present there to verify the survey, the commissioners asked for more time for this

 How to verify the old survey? In front of the committee, the commissioners presented their views and asked how to verify the survey MCD sent about 12 years ago
 kamishnaron ne bataaya ki yudi mantralay ke sachiv ke mutabik supreme court ke aadesh ke tahat sadaken tab tak notiphoi nahin hongi jab tak unka thik se survey nahin hoga
 In such a situation, they have to study the survey sent by the old commissioners and officers and only after conducting the latest survey, they will verify it so that no shortage is found later

 malik ko malaal is baat kaa he ki us badi jeet ko sabhi bhul chuke hai
 Malik said that Kargil was India's first television war and it promoted a 'strategic culture' in the country, but lost what we found due to political constraints
 chandigarh ke upnagar panchakula main rahane vaale 74 varshiya malik ne kaha ki hamen kargil vijay kaa utsav manaanaa chahie
 Unfortunately, the Kargil war has become a political football
 unhone kaha ki kargil vijay main raajnneeti pravesh kar gai or samaaroh raajnneetik footbal ban gaye
 As we saw, political rivals did what they thought was appropriate
 kisi ne jashn manaaya to kisi ne yuddh kii aalochana kii
 Malik said that the armed forces got a lot of support from the people and media, but politics entered it
 natijatan, shuruyaat main to behatar aayojan hue lekin baad main shaayad hi koi samaaroh hua ho
 Gradually people started forgetting it, because it did not bring much political benefit to anyone

 The Kargil War lasted from May to July in 1999
 is yuddh main pakistani sainikon ko peeche hatana padaa tha bhartiya sainikon ne pakistan ke kabje vaale ilaake ko khaali kara liya tha
 Malik, however, considers the 1971 war with Pakistan much bigger and 'great' than Kargil and agrees that this war brought Bangladesh into existence

 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi met more than 100 tribal leaders from across the country
 rahul se milakar nikle netaaon ko sabase zyaada khushi is baat kii thi ki takreeban 4 ghante rahul ne sabhi netaaon kii baat suni
 In these four hours, Rahul himself spoke for only 5 minutes and then listened to the leaders for 4 hours
 madhya pradesh se adivasee vidhayak onkaar singh ne ajtak se kaha ki rahulji par virdohi, ilzaam lagaate hai ki wo kisi kii sunate nahin, jabaki unhone 4 ghante aaraam se ham sabko suna
 Initially, Rahul said that you people should speak on the political, social and economic issues of the tribals
 jiske baad sabane yaheen se shuruyaat kar di
 In the Congress party, tribals are no longer respected
 is par rahul ko kahana padaa ki maanata hum ki party main adivaasiyon ke prati kuch netaaon kii durbhaavna hoti he, par main nai vyavastha bana rahaa hum
 a letter written in Hindi and English was also distributed to the leaders who attended the meeting, in which 15 questions related to the tribals and 12 issues related to them were asked to put their views around
 kya hogi nai vyavastheb congress main sirf asti vibhaag kaa mukhiya banane kii bajaay ek adivasee ko mahasachiv bhi banaaya jayega
 Tribal areas across the country will be divided into 4 regions
 mahasachiv ke neeche 4 adivasee sachiv honge, jinke haath main ek ek rigen hoga
 With this, this group will be involved in every major meeting of the party, as well as in the states, the ST department of the state will also be given importance along with the chairman
 rahul ke saamne uthi adivasee regiment kii mangarahul ke saamne odisha ke purv mukhyamantri hemanand biswal ne naksaliyon se nipatane ke liye gorkha regiment kii tarj par vishesh taur se adivasee regiment banane kii sarkaar se maang karne kii vakaalat kii, jiskaa zyaadaatar logon ne samarthan bhi kiya
 On this, Rahul said that, he will seriously consider this issue in the party
 upie sarkaar main mantri rahe tushaar choudhary ne ajtak se kaha ki bilkul ye maang saamne ai jis par party ke bade netaaon ke saath charchaa hogi
 Former Union Minister Kishore Chandra Dev, who was officially confronted with the media after Rahul asked him to prepare a blueprint against the tribal policies of the Modi government, said that the Modi government is the enemy of the tribals
 iske baad unhone 7 muddon ko centre main rakhkar apni ranneeti banane kii baat kahi-1
 Heila-hawali of Modi Sarkar in implementing Water Jungle Law 2
 khanan ke patton kaa adivaasiyon ko uchit muaavja nahin3
 No new plans for the interests of tribals, many schemes were discontinued and many were renamed
 narmada baandh ke aas paas rahane vaale adivaasiyon ko pani ab tak naseeb nahin, jabaki unki zaminein le lee gayi thim5
 There is no government plan for tribal youth, why are they attracted towards the Naxalites 6
 naksaliyon ke nishane par ek taraf CRPF jawan to duusari taraf adivasee, lekin sarkaar koi pahal nahin kar rahi7
 Funds cut in Naxal-affected areas
 Why Kehrahul believes that to stop the Modi government's land acquisition law, the way the farmers gathered forced the Karmodi government to step back, in the same way, raise the issues of the tribals and launch a movement against the Modi government 
 lekin usase pehle adivaasiyon ko congress se jodne kii badi chunauti unke saamne hai

 But could not win a single seat
 isse pehle ke aam chunaav main basapa se 21 saansad chune gaye the
 Therefore, given all these conditions, Mayawati does not want the 2019 election to be short of any alliance and reduce her seats

 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘varsh 1991 ke (bhugtan santulan sankat) sankat ko doharaaye jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he

 According to a Delhi Police official, a DCP of the Special Cell has sent an alert to all the districts in view of the possibility of a terrorist attack

 mafia don se rajaneta bane atik ahamed ne kshetreey sanghathan ‘apana dal’ ke ummidavaar ke rup main elahabaad (pashchim) vidhansabha seat se parchaa daakhil kiya
 Ahmed is currently under judicial custody in a jail in Basti district of Uttar Pradesh under the Gangster Act
 chunaav adhikari ko unka namakan patr unke vakil saulat hanif ne daakhil kiya
 The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, which had once been fiercely opposed to each other, have started the work of sending a message to the voters that both parties have forgotten their old feud
 saath hi kaaryakarta donon dalon ke ummidavaaron ko jitaane ke liye qamar kas len, or isse bhi badi baat yah he ki basapa supremeo mayawati sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ke liye raily karne mainpuri jaaengi
 Sources said that Mayawati will address a joint rally in Mainpuri on April 19 from where Mulayam Singh Yadav is the candidate
 donon dalon ke sabhi cordinator ko saajha reliyon kii taiyaari karne ko kaha gaya he
 However, it is being told that the joint election rallies of SP-BSP and RLD in Uttar Pradesh will start in a phased manner after Holi
 lekin sawaal he ki mayawati mulaayam singh ke saath manch saajha karengi yaa nahin?baharhaal, mainpuri main mayawati kii prastavi raily ko mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 This is important because after about 28 years, perhaps the BSP-SP has come together
 isse pehle 1995 main sapa-basapa ne upi vidhansabha kii kramshah 256 or 164 siton par milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 The SP managed to win 109 seats while the BSP was successful in 67 seats
 lekin 1995 main hue guest house cond se donon partiyaan alag ho gayi or phir inamen tab gathbandhan kii sambhaavna tab bani jab donon partiyon ke saamne apana astitv bachaane kaa sawaal saamne aa khadaa hua
 It is also well known that after the guest house scandal Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav have been making rude comments against each other
 is talkhi kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki basapa ke saath sapa ke gathbandhan ko lekar mulaayam singh virodh jataa chuke hai
 Recently, Mulayam Singh had said, 'now he (akhilesh Yadav) has aligned with Mayawati in half the seats
 akhilesh ne mujhase puche bina hi basapa se gathbandhan kar liya
 What is the basis of giving half the seats? Now we have only half the seats left
 hamaari party kahin adhik damdaar he
 We are strong, but our people are weakening the party
 hamane kitni shashakt party banaai thi or main mukhyamantri bana or raksha mantri bhi bana
 But despite this resentment of Mulayam Singh, SP President Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati are pushing forward the agenda of the alliance
 donon dalon ne chunaav prachaar ko lekar sanyukt kaarykram taiyaar kiya he
 In this sequence, joint rallies from western UP will begin in Navratri
 pehali sanyukt raily 7 april ko devband main hogi jise mayawati, sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh ajit singh sambodhit karenge
 Such rallies will take place across the state with coalition leaders jointly sharing the stage
 sapa ke rashtriya sachiv rajendra choudhary ne guuruuvaar ko bataaya ki sapa-basapa-ralod ke gathbandhan se raajnneeti main ek nai lahar paidaa hui he
 Akhilesh Yadav believes that there is nervousness and resentment in the BJP camp due to the increasing trend in the public towards this alliance based on ideology
 unhone kaha ki janata haalanki ab bhaajapa ke bahekaave main aane vaali nahin he
 He has come to know the full character of the BJP, so now with the determination to elect a new Prime Minister and a new government in the 2019 elections, no power can deter the voter
 bataa den ki akhilesh yadav ne kabhi sapa kii dhur virdohi rahi basapa ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 Both parties have also allocated seats for the Lok Sabha elections
 sapa 37 jabaki basapa 38 siton par chunaav ladegi, vahiin, gathbandhan amethi or raibareli main koi ummidavaar nahin utaaregaa
 When the budget is presented in the Parliament, the highest officers of our forces numbering more than 10 lakhs watch it carefully
 in logon ke kandhe par desh kii simaaon kii raksha, ek arab se zyada logon kii suraksha kii jimmedaari hoti he
 Ultimately, the fate of the defense sector is determined by how much the government is willing to allocate for the forces
 pichley kai bajet se raksha kshetra ko jo aavanton ho rahaa he, vah sena adhikariyon ko santusht karne laayak baat nahin he
 In such a situation, when our country has to deal with the situation like Doklam, the defense budget of one and a half percent of GDP can be considered sufficient
 desh ke saamne khatre bade hai, do parmaanu takat vaale padosi hamaare dushman hai
 But the equipment that our soldiers have is small and is getting old
 haalat yah he ki airforce ke tamaam helicopter or vimaanon ko 'udate taabut' kaha ja rahaa he
 The Navy has only a few dozen submarines, while China has more than 60
 sena ko agle kuch varshon main 2,200 155eem topon kii jarurat he, lekin use abhi 145 hovitger em 777 top bhi nahin mil paae hai
 There is no end to this list
 hamaare paas jo gola-barood hai, unase mahaj 40 din tak hi jang ladi ja sakati he
 Most of our helicopters are old and require 1,000 to 1200 helicopters in the next 10 years
 vaayu sena ke 42 squadrance ghatakar 32 hi rah gaye hai or inamen or kami aegi, kyonki mig 23 or mig 27 jaise vimaan ritair ho gaye hai
 The government is showing interest in approving all defense procurement deals, but it seems that the Ministry of Defense is not coming out of its failure
 agar ham raksha kharid kii baat karen to sena ke paas dikhaane ke liye kuch khaas nahin he
 The government's new defense procurement process (DPP), 2016 is more progressive than the old DPP 2013, but it has not increased the pace of procurement
 agar jidipi ke hisaab se baat karen to pratiraksha bajet iskaa mahaj 1
 56 percent, while the Parliamentary Committee on Defense Affairs says it should be at least 3 percent
 shekatkar samiti ne ise kam se kam 2
 It is said to be 2 percent
 pakistan kaa raksha bajet vahaan ke jidipi kaa 3
 5 percent and 1 in China
 9 fisadi he
 Israel 5 of its GDP
 7 fisadi pratiraksha par kharch karata he
 If we talk about global average, then also 2
 2 fisadi he
 China's economy is much larger than us, so it can be understood that its defense budget is much higher than us
 agar ham isi tarah pratirakshabajet kaa aavantankarte rahe to hamaari sena or china kii sena ke bich khai or badhati jaaegi
 Therefore our country's defense budget will have to increase significantly
 aisa bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki zyada raksha kharch se baaki growth par asar padegaa
 After all, a country like Israel has a GDP of 5
 7 fisadi kharch karte hue bhi apane growth ko acchhee tarah se prabandhit kar rahe hai
 Our country stands at a crossroads in terms of security
 hamen apni kshetreey suraksha ko banaae rakhane ke liye nirnaayak kadam uthaane honge

 '' (input bhashaa se) The mastermind of the suicide bombings in Sri Lanka was none other than Maulvi Zahran Hashim, a terrorist of the National Tauheed Jamaat (NTJ) organization
 ek website ke hawaale se khabar he ki hashim ne shangari laa hotel main aatmghaatee hamalaa kiya or khud ko uda liya
 Extremist cleric Zahran Hashim was a lecturer and speaker
 jaankaree mili he ki vah dow
 Zakir was inspired by Naik, who is currently the most wanted in India
 jerusalem post ke anusaar, charampanthi maulavee zahraan hashim ek imam ke taur par NTJ ke saath kaam karata tha
 According to a CNN report, Hashim wanted to attack the Indian High Commission in Colombo earlier this month, but the attack was foiled
 imam maulavee zahraan hashim naslwad or islamic varchasv kii vichaardhaara ko maanane vaala tha
 She also posted several videos on youtube, in which she could be seen promoting propaganda
 apane ek video main kattarpanthi maulavee zahraan hashim kahata dikh rahaa he ki zakir nike ke liye srilankai musalmaan kya kar sakate hai?bharat main jakir nike kaa naam janaa-pahachaanaa he
 However, he is now one of the most controversial permanent residents of Indian Islamic preacher Malaysia
 apane vyakhyanon or sandeshon se nafrat failaane ke liye badnaam jakir nike bharat main most wonted he
 The question then arises as to whether the mastermind of Sri Lankan terror attacks was inspired by Zakir Naik
 Last month, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) of India accused the controversial Muslim preacher Zakir Naik of money laundering in the name of the Islamic Research Foundation
 jise wo muslim samudaay ke saamaajik kalyaan ke liye chalaata tha
 It is alleged that he diverted his income to organize suspected donations for the same and to purchase the property
 zakir nike ne kathith rup se 113 million kii sampatti diawart kii thi
 According to a Times of India report, these properties also included at least 20 flats in Mumbai and Pune cities of India
 idi ne 21 march ko jakir ke sahyogi jeweler abdul kaadir najmuddin shatak ko giraftaar kiya tha, jo kathith taur par yuai se sandigdh mul fund ko transfar karne main jakir nike kii madad kar rahaa tha
 Most Wanted Zakir Naik's citizenship in India was also revoked
 use malaysia kii purv najeeb sarkaar ne sthaayee nivas kii anumati di thi
 After this, when the new government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad took power, the Prime Minister said that Malaysia will not deport Zakir unless he is creating a problem in the country
 bataate chalem ki dow
 Zakir Naik is already banned in Canada and the UK
 use 1 july 2016 ko dhaka ke ek restaraan main 22 logon kii hatya karne vaale aatankwaadiyon ko prerit karne vaala muslim upadeshak bhi mana jaataa he
 In a video uploaded to youtube in 2009, one of the viewers asked Zakir if the suicide attack could ever be right
 is par jakir ne vivaadaaspad jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki agar halaat kii zarurat or vakt kii maang ho to aatmghaatee bam visphot haraam nahin ho saktaa he
 He also mentioned Palestine in that video
 ek baar jakir nike ne daawa kiya tha ki al-kaayda netaa osama bin laden aatankwaadi nahin tha
 He said that if osama-bin-laden is fighting the enemies of Islam, then i am with him
 agar vah sabase pade aatanki america ko aatankit kar rahaa he to main uske saath hum or aise kaam ke liye har musalmaan ko aatankwaadi hona chahie
 If he is terrorizing a terrorist, he is following Islam
 dow
 Zakir Naik once justified keeping sex slaves
 usne daawa karte hue kaha tha ki islam main is tarah kii pratha kii anumati he
 In 2010, Zakir said that there are many verses in the Quran that say that you can have sex with your wife and also with others
 dilachasp baat yah he ki, jakir nike ne srilanka ke aatanki hamalon kii ninda kii he
 So that it is not linked to NTJ

 el ken ke ek alag maamle main maathur ne raashtrapati bhawan ke us tark ko khaarij kar diya ki unka sawaal ‘‘soochna’’ kii paribhaasha ke tahat nahin aata jise artiai kanoon ke tahat poocha jaae
 He had asked the question whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi had informed the President of his decision to discontinue the 500 and one thousand rupee notes and issue a new note of two thousand rupees
 notebandi par yachikakarta kii artiai par pradhanmantri karyaalay, raashtrapati sachivalay or vitt mantralay se santoshjanak jawaab nahin milane ke baad ken ne soochna ayog kaa ruukh kiya tha
 Ken had also sought a copy of the order given for issuing a new currency of Rs 2000 along with a copy of the note ban decision from the Prime Minister's Office
 iske saath kii yachikakarta ne doordarshan dwaara prachaarit pradhanmantri ke us bhaashan kii mul prati bhi maangi thi jisamen unhone notebandi kaa elaan kiya tha
 Read this: After demonetisation, these 9500 companies had illegally changed old currency! Denying these demands of the petitioner, the Prime Minister's Office said that the answer to these questions will harm the economic interest of the country
 iske saath hi pradhanmantri karyaalay ne daleel di thi ki yachikakarta ne sawaal poocha he or na ki usase kisi soochna ke liye aavedan kiya he
 Therefore, on the basis of this reply of the Prime Minister's Office, the Information Commission has asked the Prime Minister's Office how demonetisation data can harm the country's economy
 iske saath hi ayog ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ke un adhikariyon ko bhi aane ke liye kaha he jinke paas notebandi se jude dastavej maujuud hai
 Significantly, Ken had questioned in his petition whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi had informed the President about the decision of demonetisation
 yachikakarta ne yah bhi daawa kiya tha ki 2000 rupee kii nai karency ko jari karne ke maamle main rigerv bank ke niyamon kii andekhi kii gai he
 Ken's response to questions asked through RTI was also significant because the demonetization decision had an impact on the entire country and nearly 150 deaths were also recorded in the demonetization process

 shaadiyon kaa mausam chal rahaa he to ek rupee ke note se jude kisse ham sabhi ko yaad honge
 To give the omen, envelopes bearing one rupee coin have started coming, but there was a time that family members used to go around looking for a rupee note
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki yahi ek rupee kaa note kareeb 100 saal kaa ho chukaa he or isaki shuruyaat kaa itihaas bhi bada dilachasp he
 It happened that it was the era of the First World War and the British ruled the country
 us dauraan ek rupee kaa sikaa chalaa karata tha jo chaandi kaa hua karata tha lekin yuddh ke chalate sarkaar chaandi kaa sikaa dhaalane main asamarth ho gai or is prakaar 1917 main pehali baar ek rupee kaa note logon ke saamne aayaa
 It replaced that silver coin
 thik sau saal pehle 30 november 1917 ko hi yah ek rupee kaa note saamne aayaa jis par britain ke raja jorge pancham kii tasviir chhapi thi
 According to the Reserve Bank of India website, the printing of this note was first discontinued in 1926 because it cost more
 iske baad ise 1940 main phir se chhapana shuru kar diya gaya jo 1994 tak anwarat jari rahaa
 Later printing of this note was resumed in 2015
 is note kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki ise anya bhartiya noton kii tarah bhartiya rigerv bank jari nahin karata balki swayan bharat sarkaar hi isaki chapai karti he
 It is not signed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank but is signed by the Finance Secretary of the country
 itnaa hi nahin kanoonee aadhaar par yah ek maatr vaastavik ‘mudra’ note (karency note) he baaki sab note dhariya note (promisri note) hote hai jis par dharak ko utani raashi adaa karne kaa vachan diya gaya hota he
 Girish Veera, a prominent coin collector of Dadar, said, "during the first world war, silver prices had increased a lot
 isliye jo pehla note chapa gaya us par ek rupee ke usee puraane sikke kii tasviir chhapi
 Since then, it has become a tradition that a rupee coin has a picture of a rupee coin printed on it
 ’ shaayad yahi kaaran he ki kanoonee bhashaa main is rupee ko us samay ‘sikaa’ bhi kaha jaataa tha
 The first one rupee note was signed by three finance secretaries of the British Government
 ye naam ms gubbe, asi macwators or ech
 Were Denning
 aazaadee se ab tak 18 vitt sachivon ke hastakshar vaale ek rupee ke note jari kiye gaye hai
 According to Veera, printing of one rupee note was halted twice and its design also underwent radical changes at least three times, but it is still invaluable for collectors
