 Left leader Gurudas Das Gupta questioned why Saurabh Ganguly and other captains were not nominated to the Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ke gopinath munde ne kaha ki sachin ko pehle bharat ratna diya janaa chahie
 Uddhav Thackeray of Shiv Sena raised some similar objections
 unhone pehle to vyangyatmak tippanee kii, baad main sanjay raut ne kaha ki sachin ko pehle bharat ratna diya janaa chahie
 When asked by Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray that the central government is nominating Sachin for Rajya Sabha, he said in a sarcastic tone that it is only Sachin and Congress that know what is going on between the two
 aurangabad main uddhav thakare jis kaarykram main hissaa lene pahunche the usee kaarykram main bijepi ke varisht netaa gopinath munde bhi pahunche the
 Gopinath Munde has also questioned the nomination of Sachin for the Rajya Sabha
 munde ne kaha ki sachin ko saasand banane kii bajaae centre sarkaar ko pehle unhen bharat ratna dena chahie
 Munde questioned the intent of the Congress regarding the matter
 mashhoor singer aashaa bhonsle ne bhi sachin ko sansad main manonith kiye jane par sawaal khadey kiye
 He said that Sachin should show his skill in the cricket field itself
 sachin kii pehle sonia gandhi se mulaakaat or phir rajyasabha kii sadsyta ke liye manonayan- kai sawaal khadey kar gaya
 There is speculation that there is no breach between the Congress and Sachin, but if Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar believes that Sonia and Sachin's meeting should not be interpreted in any other way
 is bich sachin ko lekar siyasat bhi tej ho gai he
 The news of Sachin coming to Congress is hot
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main sanjay nirupam ne kaha ki sachin kaa congress main swaagat he
 If they come to the Congress, then the Congress will have a stronger hand
 sipiai netaa gurudas dasgupta ne sachin ko rajyasabha ke liye manonit karne kaa swaagat kiya he lekin unhone sawaal kiya ki saurav ganguli ko ye sammaan kyon nahin diya gaya
 He said that the government should focus on sports other than cricket

 According to sources, he has told all this to the Delhi Police

 ' The Gandhian Anna Hazare side sought to clarify the stand of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the issue, alleging that there was no proper provision for 'investigation and prosecution' against judges in the Judicial Accountability Bill
 hazaare paksh ne sawaal kiya ki kya sarkaar nyaayik javabdehi vidheyak ko waapas lekar nayaa vidheyak pesh karegi
 Know who are Anna Hazareralen: After two days of meeting in Siddhi, the workers of Hazare party returned to the capital, through the issue of Judicial Accountability Bill, again raised their old demand to include the higher judiciary within the purview of the proposed Lokpal
 hazaare paksh ke arvind kejariwal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ham chaahate hai ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh puri eemaandaaree ke saath is mudde par sthiti spasht karen
 The government had said that the higher judiciary will not be placed under the purview of the Lokpal and appropriate provisions will be made for this in the Judicial Accountability Bill
 ’unhone kaha ki lekin is vidheyak par sthaayee samiti kii haalia report main bhi nyaaypalika ke sadasyon ke bhrashtachar se nipatane ke praavdhaan nahin hone ke chalate pradhanmantri ko yah spasht karnaa chaiye ki kya unki sarkaar is vidheyak ko waapas lekar nayaa vidheyak pesh karegi or agar aisa hua to vah kab hoga
 Photo: Fellow pro-hazar activist and advocate Prashant Bhushan, who took to the streets for Anna, alleged that the government kept the entire country in mind that proper provisions would be made for it in the Judicial Accountability Bill, not keeping the judiciary within the ambit of Lokpal
 lekin sarkaar ne aisa nahin karke desh ko gumraah kiya
 Significantly, the Judicial Norms and Accountability Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha last year
 is par pichley maheene hi vidhi or nyaay maamalon kii sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne apni report pesh kii he
 Bhushan said, 'therefore, we reiterate our old stand that the judiciary should be allowed to remain within the ambit of the Independent Lokpal as the Judicial Accountability Bill has many bad provisions and that is to investigate the allegations of corruption on members of the higher judiciary and Does not throw light on the issues of prosecution of them
 ’anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejunhone daawa kiya ki nyaayik javabdehi vidheyak or us par sthaayee samiti kii report kisi nyaayadhish ke khilaaf kadachaar kii shikaayat milane par hone vaali karrwai se hi sambandhit he
 It does not mention the investigation and prosecution of corruption charges
 adhivaktaa ne aarope lagaaya ki is vidheyak main aise kai praavdhaan hai jinamein khamia hai
 The bill states that the allegations against any judge will be investigated by his fellow judges and members of the legislature and the executive will also be included in the monitoring committee and investigation committee
 in muddon par hamen aapatti he
 Know what is Jan Lokpal? Bhushan and Kejriwal also took on the NCPRI of retired judges and National Advisory Council member Aruna Roy
 unhone kaha ki ensipiarai or sevanivrutt nyaayadhishon ne kaha tha ki lokapal ke daayre main nyaaypalika ko nahin rakhaa jaye, lekin kisi ne bhi yah spsht nahin kiya ki iskaa vikalp kaisaa hona chaiye
 He said that questions arise as to whether NCPRI had tried to create any pressure before the Standing Committee and whether the issue was also raised in the National Advisory Council meeting
 ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karankejariwal kaha ki is sambandh main hazaare paksh pradhanmantri ko savistaar chitthee likhegaa or iske baad aage kii ranneeti tay hogi

 unhone kaha ki yah yah mudda isaliye bhi praasangik he kyonki nyaayamurti saumitr sen ke khilaaf haal hi main rajyasabha ne mahabhiyog prastaav ko paarit kiya he
 But now the question arises whether they will be investigated and whether they will be tried
 purv vidhi mantri shanti bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki nyaayik javabdehi vidheyak betuka he
 He said that the plea of not including the judiciary within the purview of the Lokpal will be accepted only when concrete provisions will be made in this subject in the Judicial Accountability Bill
 kiran bedi ne kaha ki yah vidheyak darshata he ki kis tarah janpratinidhi janata kii ichha ke khilaaf jaakar vidheyak banaate hai or use paarit karaane kii koshish karte hai

 i have not received any such communication from the state government so far that any of my actions are beyond my jurisdiction

 Jyotiraditya Scindia has increased his activities in Madhya Pradesh especially Bhopal ever since Congress President Rahul Gandhi changed Madhya Pradesh organization and made MP and former Union Minister chairman of Madhya Pradesh Election Campaign Committee
 duusare congressi netaa jab bhopal main deraa daale hue hai to aise main sindhiya ko yahaan rahakar kaaryakartaaon se sidhaa judaav rakhkar apana prabhaav barkaraar rakhane main sabase badi chunauti awaas ko lekar aa rahi he
 That is why they have sent an application to the government for a government bungalow
 isamen unhone tark diya he ki apane kshetra ke vikaas ke liye baar-baar bhopal aana janaa padataa he
 Being an MP from Madhya Pradesh, he deserves a government bungalow in the capital Bhopal, but the BJP argues something else behind it
 bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki congress main sindhiya ke par katare ja rahe hai
 He is asking for a government bungalow in Bhopal to save his political status, not for public problems
 aisa nahin he to chunaav ke maukey par hi kyon vah awaas ke liye chitthee likh rahe hai
 Actually, Jyotiraditya Scindia has written such a letter after sixteen years about the government residence in Bhopal
 jyotiraditya sindhiya ne jo sarkari bangala maanga he use vidhansabha chunaav main unki sakriyata ko dekhakar joda ja rahaa he
 Right now, if in a program in Bhopal, if Sindya has to reach to cut the lace, then she has to reach Bhopal by catching a flight from Delhi
 sindhiya ke dilli main rahane ke kaaran unke samarthakon ko unase milane main lagaataar kathinaayee aa rahi he
 Right now either Scindia stays in the hotel or he has to stay in the guest house
 haalanki bhaajapa ise doosraa hi rang de rahi he
 BJP State Spokesperson Rahul Kothari believes that Jyotiraditya Scindia is constantly being shunned by the Congress
 pehle lag rahaa tha ki digvijay singh ko kinare kar sindhiya ko party ne aage kiya he, lekin baad main pachori or digvijay singh ko ahm jimmedaari dekar sindhiya ko party str par jhatka laga he
 In such a situation, Jyotiraditya Scindia is now beginning to realize that in the coming time, he will not have any room to sit in the state Congress office
 kothaari kehete hai ki sindhiya vaise bhi maharaj hai or nawabi hotel main ruknaa unka shauk rahaa he
 Where would they like the government bungalow anyway
 bhaajapa ke anya netaa bhi maanate hai ki darasal sindhiya ko rahanaa to mahal or hotalon main hi he
 To maintain his political existence, he wants to open office in it and seat supporters
 vahiin congress ke pravaktaa pankaj chaturvedi kehete hai, jyotiraditya sindhiya guna loksabhaa ke saansad he
 As an MP, he is eligible to get government accommodation in the capital
 kai bhaajapa netaaon ko sarkari awaas bhopal main mila hua he to sindhiya ko bhi milanaa chahie
 If the leaders of BJP have objections in this, then it is their petty politics
 jo bhaajapa kah rahi kahin baat vahi to nahin !jyotiraditya sindhiya ne 23 may ko hi shashan ko shaskeey awaas ke liye patr likhaa to is par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye
 In the letter, Scindia has mentioned that he is an MP from Guna Lok Sabha constituency and has to come to Bhopal in connection with the development work of his region
 ab sawaal yahi he ki vah chunaav ke pehle hi kyon bhopal main awaas chaahate hai
 Is he lagging behind other Congress leaders and now has the leadership also started questioning him after his stay in Delhi
 yah baat bhi saaf he ki sindhiya ko sarkari bangala miltaa he to vah congress pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath or purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke baad vah congress kaa teesraa bada power centre sabit ho sakate hai
 In this election, Scindia's focus is on connecting the youth with him and drawing a big political streak
 bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh ne bhi maanga sarkari awaas, mushkil main grih vibhagapehle bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh rakesh singh or phir congress prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh jyotiraditya sindhiya dwaara sarkari awaas maange jane ko lekar grih vibhaag pareshaani main he
 The biggest difficulty before the allocation of government bungalows is that which bungalow should he give to Rakesh Singh and which to Scindia! Both are mps from Madhya Pradesh
 abhi kai daavedaar qatari menhain
 Self
 sunderlaal patwa ke nidhan ke baad unke bhattije va rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) surendra patwa 74 bangale sthit awaas main rah rahe hai, jabaki bagal vaala bangala bhi unke paas tha, jo ab rajya maanavadhikaar ayog ke adhyaksh ko aavantit kar diya gaya he
 Minister of State Vishwas Sarang is living on Link Road and an application has been made on his behalf to get a bungalow attached to it
 mantri rampal singh ke shaskeey awaas se laga hua bangala bhi ve hi istemaal kar rahe hai
 It is being told that the bungalow is allotted to all other public representatives except the ministers as being exclusive

 unhone kaha, "khudara main epadiai se bichauliya samskruti samaapt nahin hogi
 There are also examples such as sugar industry, where there is no middleman, yet farmers have to struggle for cane pricing

 Sibal said, "but if a chief minister wants to bring FDI in retail, how can you stop it?" " Sibal said, "the purpose of this policy is to provide farmers more than the price they are getting in the market today
" " Sibal said, "only 15 to 17 percent of the market value is available to the farmers
 vipakshi netaaon ko yah tay karnaa hoga ki ve kisaanon ke saath hai yaa bichauliyon ke saath
 
 
 
 " Sibal said, "it has been decided that FDI will be allowed in retail only in cities where the population is more than 10 lakh
 aise 53 shahar hai
 After that we realized that some states have opposition governments
 yadi un rajyon ko alag kar diya jaae, jo ise lagu nahin karnaa chaahate, to 18 shahar batch jate hai
 "he said that therefore such stores can be opened in only 18 cities in the country

 loksabhaa main bahes kii shuruyaat karte hue netaa pratipaksh sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki bahubrands khudara main epadiai chote udyogon ke liye mrityughosh sabit hoga
 Swaraj said that the government's claim is a myth that foreign investment will benefit farmers, consumers and create employment
 swaraj ne kaha, "sarkaar khudara main epadiai kii anumati dene se pehle sabhi ghatakon ke saath raay-mashvira karne ke apane vaade se palat gai he
 " bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, "antarrashtriya anubhav bataate hai ki khudara vyapaaree mulya nirdhaaran main luteri niti apanaate hai or ve keemten gata dete hai taaki anya dukaane band ho jaaen or jab puraa bazaar samaapt ho jayega tab ve keemten badha denge or aisi sthiti main upabhoktaaon ke paas oonchi keemton par kharidari karne ke alaava doosraa koi vikalp nahin bachegaa
 " sushamaa ne sarkaar ke is tark ko khaarij kar diya ki videshi nivesh se bichauliye kii bhoomika samaapt ho jaaegi
 He said, "FDI in retail will not end the middleman culture
 yahaan chini udyog jaise udhaaharan bhi hai, jahaan koi bichauliya nahin he, phir bhi kisaanon ko ganne ke mulya nirdhaaran ke liye sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 " sarkaar ke is daawey ko khaarij karte hue ki epadiai se rojgaar badhegaa, sushamaa ne kaha, "sarkaar kahati he ki epadiai se 40 lakh logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 But considering these figures, if we have to give employment to such a large number of people, then Walmart, Tesco and other companies coming to India will need to open more than 36,000 stores in 53 cities
 or iskaa arth yah hota he ki prayek shahar main 600 se adhik store honge
 " swaraj ne kaha, "sarkaar kahati he ki videshi companiyon ko 30 pratishat utpaada bhartiya chote or madhyam udhyamon se lenaa hoga, yani 70 pratishat utpaada aayaat kiye jaaenge
 Can an industry survive at 30 percent production? And 90 percent of imported goods will come from China and this will lead to employment and growth in China, not in India
 " Sushma reiterated US President Barack Obama's statement that small businesses are the engines of growth in America

 The Supreme Court stayed the decision of the Allahabad High Court on 24 September on the Babri Masjid Ramjanm land ownership dispute in Ayodhya for a week and fixed the next hearing in the case to 28 September
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne ramesh chandra treepathi kii yachika par sabhi sambhddha pakshon ko notice jari kiya
 Tripathi, in his petition, challenged the Allahabad High Court's decision refusing to stay the stay on the ownership dispute
 nyaayalay agle mangalvaar ko faisle ko taalane ke treepathi ke aagrah par sunwaayee karegaa
 He stayed the verdict for a week after a bench of Justices RV Raveendran and HL Gokhale challenged the high court order challenging the hearing of the petition
 nyaayamurti rabindran kaa maananaa tha ki vishesh anumati yachika ko khaarij kar diya janaa chaiye jabaki nyaayamurti gokhale kaa kahana tha ki samaadhaan ke vikalp kii talash karne ke liye sambhddha pakshon ko notice jari kiya janaa chaiye
 But then Justice Raveendran agreed to accept the opinion of Justice Gokhale
 apane aadesh main nyaayamurti rabindran ne kaha ki parampara yahi he ki jab kisi ek nyaayadhish kii raay alag ho to notice jari kiya jaye
 The Supreme Court also sent notice to the Attorney General
 treepathi kii ore se pesh hote hue varisht vakil ne kaha ki is maamle main sulah safai kaa mauka dekar ucchtam nyaayalay raahat pradaan kar saktaa he
 He said that it is possible that on receipt of the notice of the Supreme Court, the parties concerned will agree on a discussion for a good solution
 rohtagi ne kaha ki agle mangalvaar ko unka paksh sheersh nyaayalay ko yah bataane kii koshish karegaa ki maamle par faisla taal diya jaye taaki dharmik, raajnneetik or rashtriya netaa milakar koi samaadhaan nikaalane kaa prayaas kar saken
 He said that it is not only a matter involving ten or twenty parties in the case but a matter involving millions of crores of people and some way out of the discussion can be found
five days after elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu peeth ke treepathi kii yachika khaarij kar dene ke paanch din baad unhone ucchtam nyaayalay main yachika daayar kar madhyasthata ke liye thodaa or samay dene kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Apart from this, he has also challenged the fine imposed by the High Court
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke samaksh daayar yachika main treepathi ne kaha he ki is faisle se sampradayik sadbhaav ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or desh main hinsa ho sakati he
 In the petition, Tripathi has given several reasons behind the appeal to defer the decision
 unhone kaha he ki sampradayik dangon kii ashanka, aane vaale rashtramandal khelon, bihar main chunaav or kashmir ghati main hinsa evam naksal prabhavit kshetron main hinsa ke maddenjar is faisle ko taala janaa ‘lok hit’ main hoga
 It has been feared in the petition that security personnel will also not be sufficient to provide security in Uttar Pradesh
 treepathi ne adaalat ke 27 july ke ek puraane faisle kaa sandarbh diya he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki sambandhit partiyaan peeth ke gathan ke liye visheshadhikari se sampark karne ke liye swatantra hai, basharte is vivaad ko khatm kiye jane yaa aapasi sahmati se kisi parinaam par pahunchane kii sambhaavna ho
 The Supreme Court bench of Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice AK Patnaik on Wednesday refused to hear the petition in haste
 peeth ne kaha tha ki unhen is mudde par nirnay karne kaa ‘adhikaar’ nahin he
 The bench had also said that it would be listed against the other bench
 isse purv treepathi ne faisla taalane ke liye elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha, lekin paanch din pehle ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu khandpeeth ne 60 saal puraane ram janmabhumi-babari masjid malikana haq ke vivaad kaa samaadhaan talash karne ke liye madhyasthata kii anumati maangane vaali yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 After this Tripathi knocked in the Supreme Court
 elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne treepathi ke adaalat ke baahar sulah-samjhaute ke prayaas ke bare main daayar yachika ko ‘shararthpurna prayaas’ kehete hue un par 50,000 rupee kaa ‘baari jurmaana’ bhi lagaaya tha
 However, later the third judge of the same bench disagreed with this decision

 Indian coach Stephen Constantine made a change in the second half and sent Ashike Kurien to the field in place of Jerry Lalrinzuala
 jordan aatmavishvaas se bhari thi
 In the opening minutes of the second half, he made some successive strikes which were thwarted by Gurpreet, but in the 58th minute the Indian captain failed and Jordan were ahead 2–0

 ‬A photo posted by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Jan 1, 2017 at 7:04pm PST India's star of spinner Harbhajan Singh, who did not describe the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotli as international cricket, said that Motera's pitch in Ahmedabad is also not fit for Test cricket
 harbhajan ne kaha ki ahmedabad kii pich ballebaajon kii madadgaar he or is par mere, amit mishra yaa muthya muralidharan jaise gendbaajon kii bhi jamkar dhunaai hui
 It is unfair to bowlers
 bharat or srilanka ke bich november main ahmedabad main dra rahe pehle test main 1598 ran bane or sirf 21 wicket gire
 Harbhajan said that we should not play Test cricket on such wickets because it will end the bowlers
 aisi pichen kisi tarah kii cricket ke laayak nahin he
 He said that we should make such pitches for Test matches where the fast bowlers get the benefit in the initial days and later the spinners can show their talent
 unhone is baat par khushi jataai ki cricket board is saal adhik test maichon ke aayojan kii taiyaari main he jisase bharat ko number van ranking lambey samay tak bachaaye rakhane main madad milegi
 Harbhajan said, "it's a good thing to play more Tests
 bharat adhik test jitkar apni number van ranking barkaraar rakh saktaa he
 We played just six Tests last year and became number one
 ummid he ki is saal 10 se 12 test khel sakenge jinhen jitkar apni ranking kaayam rakhenge
 In the last 14 months, India rose from third to first place in the ICC Test rankings
 harbhajan kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda team bhartiya cricket ke itihaas kii sarvshereshth tiimon main se ek he
 He said, "if we look at the records then this is the best team
 hamane 35 saal baad newjiland ko uski dharti par haraaya, australia ko 24 saal baad shikast di or tii 20 vishwa cap jeeta
 The team has achieved a lot of achievements and that is why i feel that it is the best team
 ’’ vyaktigat pradarshan ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘‘main apane pradarshan se khush hum
 i took 29 wickets in six Tests, of which six wickets were against New Zealand whereas the pitches there are not helpful to the spinners
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘2008 main maine 12 test main 64 wicket liye the
 If we had played the same number of Tests in 2009, i could have repeated that performance
 ’’ yah poochne par ki karier ke kisi mode par kya unhone captaini kii khwaahish kii, harbhajan ne kaha, ‘‘har khilaadi team kaa captain bananaa chahta he
 This is a big responsibility but also a matter of Fakhr
 yadi mujhe karier ke kisi padaav par yah mauka mila to yah garv kii baat hogi
 As long as i am contributing to the success of the team, i do not hesitate to face any challenge
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin abhi dhoni bahut acha pradarshan kar rahaa he or vah bharat kaa sabase safal captain he
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, the team has become the number one Test team, whose credit goes to him
 ’’ bangladesh main trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘‘ham kisi team ko halake main nahin le rahe hai
 Bangladesh has always done well on their soil and beat Australia, England and us
 ’’ Suspended Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi has sought time till May 15 to reply to the cricket board's charge sheet and there are indications that the board will accept his request

 China has taken a new bet on the border dispute with India and Bhutan
 china ne nayaa nakshaa jari kiya he, jisamen usne gatirodh vaali jameen par daawa kiya he
 Putting forward its claim, China has said that India has interfered in its land
 iske alaava china ne ab ek nakshaa jari kiya he, jisamen gatirodh vaale kshetra ko dikhaaya gaya he
 Simultaneously, China has also claimed the india-china-bhutan tri-junction
 maanchitr kaa daawa he kibhartiya senaane dokala paas par seemaa paar kii
 The Doklam Plateau views India and Bhutan as Bhutanese territory, but is claimed by China
 ye nakshaa shuukravaar ko jari kiya gaya he
 The Chinese triangular junction is marked by an arrow, which it claims is under the british-china Treaty of 1890
 pichley 4 dinon se purvottar rajya sikkim se sate china ke border par tanaav he
 The forces of India and China are face to face
 china ne bhartiya sainikon par border main ghusane or sadak nirmaan kaa kaam rokane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Where did the dispute start? For the last few days, Indian troops protested against the construction of road in Donglong in Sikkim sector from China
 iske baad chini sainikon ne sikkim sector main bharat ke do banksron ko tod diya
 China is telling it in its border
 bhartiya sainikon ne chini sena kii is karrwai kii virodh kiya
 The history of china-india border dispute is quite long
 donon deshon ke bich 3,488 kilometre lambii seemaa he jo jammu-kashmir se lekar arunachal pradesh tak he
 Of this, 220 km falls in Sikkim
 chunki is ilaake main border line puri tarah spasht nahin he isliye koi spasht aadhaar nahin he seemaa kaa
 China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that countries are expected to respect the sovereignty of other countries
 china-bhutan simaniroopit nahin he, kisi tisare paksh ko is maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie tathaa gairjimmedaarana tippanee yaa karrwai nahin kerani chahie
 China accused India of a secret agenda and said that if a third party intervenes with a secret agenda, it is an insult to Bhutan's sovereignty
 ham aisa nahin dekhnaa chaahate kyonki bhutan antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara samprabhutaa kaa hakdaar he
 China legalized road construction in the Sikkim sector and insisted that it was being built in the Chinese region, which neither belonged to India nor Bhutan
 unhone kaha ki kisi anya desh ko hastkshep karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Few pessimists have not been convinced that it took Sachin Tendulkar and Rekha so many days to take oath as a nominated MP in the Rajya Sabha
 ve lagaataar is par chillaaye ja rahe hai
 Indeed, the political pundits of Delhi are accustomed to seeing new faces dripping saliva, whose names Akashvani can pronounce or not, but before that they are eager to jump into the golden building of democracy
 jaahir he, der-saver kii aisi ghatnaon par hamaare jaankaar aisi rahasyamay kahaniyaan nikaal laate hai jinke khilaaf daleelein kaam nahin aatin
 Let us look at the situation from the perspective of Sachin
 meraa matlab yah nahin ki ham koi marsia likhane baith jaaen, lekin sachin ke saath sahanubhuti to banati hi he
 For a person who has been promised the Bharat Ratna, membership of the Rajya Sabha is a mild option
 kuch santvanaa puraskaar aapako santvanaa dete hai, kuch dil ko chaak kar jate hai
 After all, Sachin did not ask for this honor
 vah to dilli ke netaaon kii aadat he ki ve kisi bhi baat ko lekar ud jate hai, unhone hi sachin ke 99wein antarrashtriya shatak par bharat ratna kaa raag ched diya tha
 Lady Macbeth's disaster management rule is as effective at killing Scottish rulers as it is about respect for Indian personalities - "the sooner it goes, the better
" '' agar sachin ne apana sauvaan shatak england ke khilaaf lords par yaa sidney main australia ke khilaaf bina kisi jeevandaan ke banaaya hota, to bharat ratna kii lahar ko unki ore se lautaanaa naammumkin tha
 But kharama-kharama reach Bangladesh and make a century by hanging, that too in a match in which India loses is not a great thing
 desh vaapasi par sachin kisi vijay kii lahar par savaar nahin the, koi jang jeet kar aane jaisaa unka sammaan nahin hua
 It was as if he had returned from Bangladesh riding a pony
 jab sachin ne everest jeeta, shikhar par din dhal chukaa tha or talahati main kuhasaa chaa chukaa tha
 The country had a chilling atmosphere rather than applause
 sachin ankhen khole hue the
 The crowd of those who had made up the chant was cut off and they left behind just a thank you note
 jaahir he, sansad kii sadsyta sachin ko fokat main mil gai, lekin utsaah yaa avsaad sthitiyon par nirbhar karata he
 It depends on where you started
 iske alaava sachin ko vyaavhaarik chijen bhi dekhni thim
 The daily allowance of an MP is Rs 2,000 in the Parliament session
 hota he
 Apart from this, Rs 16 as road mileage bonus
 prati kilometre kii aiyashi bhi saansadon ko hasil he
 Now do not ask how much is Sachin's daily earnings from IPL or how much his bank account would become empty after blowing a few liters of oil on the road
 main nahin jaanata ki ipiel kii kamai kaise nikaali jaati he, vah bhi tab jab khaas logon kii mehfil main shaamil hone ke alag se paise milte hon yaa nahin bhi milte hon! yadi sansad is baat ko jaraa bhi samajhati, to ipiel ke dauraan apana satr nahin rakhti, kam-se-kam tab agar vah chaahati ki sachin tendulkar is dauraan hi shapath len
 No matter how sorry you are, you cannot get happiness of both things simultaneously
 baharhaal, is sawaal kaa jaraa khud jawaab dijie ki bhartiya sansad kii 60veen saalagirah par 13 may ko aap kahaan hote? thake hue ghise-pite chutkulon ke bich lalu prasad yadav ke saath yaa phir david hasi kaa sadha hua hamalaa dekhne ke liye stands main? jabaki donon hi ghatnaon kaa sidhaa or muft prasaaran ho rahaa tha? aap kise chunate? yadi saansadon ko iskaa jawaab chahie, to unhen loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha tivi par vigyaapan ke slot bech dene chahie
 a spot of Sachin's bat would be more expensive than the Prime Minister's address sponsored by the Steel Authority in an exclusive manner
 phir sachin ko kyon dosha diya jaae yadi unhone udhaar ke vimaanon se dilli kii yatra ko thukraa kar kingfisher main bangaloru janaa chunaa?sansadeey shuddhtavaadi is baat se hataash hai ki sachin sansad ke kendriya kaksh main meetha toast or kuch had tak jaayakedaar coffee pine nahin aae
 But no one has answered a basic question: what is the hurry? It is not that there is any final date of his swearing in
 na hi sachin telecom udyog kii asann barabaadi par koi joardaar bhaashan dekar is desh ko hilaa dene yaa sarkaar ko jagaa dene kii khwaahish paale baithe hai
 Beautiful and shapely Rekha does not play cricket, this much we all know
 iske baavjood hamid ansaari ke saamne kuch lafj padhane main unhone teen hafte le liye
 i do not agree with this mischievous thing that they delayed so as to avoid confronting anyone
 shapath grahan main bole jane vaale lafjon ko lekar bhi unhen phikr karne kii koi jarurat nahin thim: hamid ansaari ko umrao jaan ke andaaj main aadab kah dene bhar se kaam ban jaataa
 Rekha's personality is quite big, but do you have any idea how long it will take for a big personality to decide what she will wear on the biggest occasion of her life? Think with your heart
 or agar dilkash rekha ke liye aap itnaa-sa bhi nahin kar sakate, to aapke paas dil hi nahin he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will take the final decision on the long-standing Shani Shingnapur temple dispute in Maharashtra

 ladki ko rokane or shuddhikaran ke baad vivadashani shinganapur mandirmen shani dev ke chabutare par mahilaon ke jane yaa puja karne kii manaahi he
 In the past, a girl tried to worship there
 mandir prabandhan ke logon ne use roka or chabutare ko saaf kiya
 After this the dispute started
 vivaad main ladki or se brigade ne andolan shuru kar diya tha
 There is a demand of women attached to the brigade not to be prevented from going to Hashni Chaputara and worshiping in the temple
 maamla sulajhane ke liye aage ai sarkarandolan ke baad siem devendra fadanvis ne desai ko ye bharosa dilaayaa tha ki mandir prabandhan se baatcheet ke baad vivaad ko sulajhane kii puri koshish karenge
 Home Minister Ram Shinde had also said that the government will make efforts to find solutions through dialogue between the temple administration and women activists
 desai ne kaha kimahila-purushonmen bhedbhaav ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Tripti is confident of victory, Trupti Desai, leader of the Brigade, said that we will put all our demands in the meeting with facts
 400 saal kii parampara ke naam par mahilaon ko rokane kii koshish sahi nahin he
 Why should women give up their rights? Seven members of the brigade went to the meeting
 dharm sansad main hogi shani puja par charchajyotishpeeth, dwarka ke shankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati ne elahabaad ke magh meley main yojitdharm sansadamein gosangrakshan or ganga kii swatchta ke saath hi shani puja masale par bhi vichaar karne kaa faisla kiya he

 bhulakshmi ke chote bete ravi kehete hai ki vah khud bhi baahar chaahate hai, lekin parivaar par karje kaa baari boj he, isliye vah yahaan se nahin ja saktaa he
 With this, he explains that any crop he grows, he has to incur losses
 karj kabhi ghatata nahin, bas badhata hi jaataa he
 This statement of Ravi reflects the anger of many poor farmers across the country
 haal hi main aae aarthik survey main bhi yah baat saamne ai he ki jidipi main kheti or isse jude kshetron kaa hissaa teji se kam hua he

 haalanki, ab bhi krishi desh ke 55 fisadi logon ko rojgaar detii he, lekin visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki kheti ke sahare jeevika chalaanaa bahut mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Despite promises and schemes, the country is not seeing a decrease in farmer suicides
 is vajah se log teji se kheti chhod rahe hai or 2001 se 2011 ke bich desh main kareeb 90 lakh logon ne kheti karnaa chhod diya

 In his speeches, Sinha calls Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah an "army of two people"
 raily main sinha ne kaha, ‘‘do logon kii sena dwaara thopi gai notebandi or jiesti ne desh kii arthvyastha ko bahut prabhavit kiya
 Shatrughan Sinha, who left the BJP and joined the Congress, had also recently targeted the BJP over the victory of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh assembly elections last year
 sinha ne sawaal kiya, "kripaya mujhe bataaie ki pappu koun he or asli phenku koun sabit hua he

 86 percent cheaper
 iske alaava CAG kii reportmen kuch or pahaluon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he
 As compared to the 2007 and 2015 deals, it is explained
 puraane or nae saude main kaaphi antar he
 This is explained in detail on page number 130 of the CAG report tabled in the Rajya Sabha
 - rafel deal ke liye jo daam bataaya gaya tha or 2015 main Indian Negotiating Team (INT) ne jis daam par fiks kiya, vah 1
 23 percent was cheaper
 lekin 2016 main jab deal sin hui to daam or bhi kam ho gaya tha, jisase deal kii kul keemat 2
 86 percent decrease
 - bataae gaye daam or fiks daam main antar isliye bhi he kyonki INT ne vimaan kii sankhya main kuch badlaav kiya tha
 Some offers were also taken care of while deciding the deal, which were also mentioned earlier
 - NDA sarkaar ne rafel par jo deal kii he, usamen 6 package liye gaye hai
 This included the fly away aircraft package, maintenance package, Indian specific enhancement, weapons package, accompanying service and a simulator package
 in 6 package main kul 14 vasteen shaamil thim
 (photo-screen shot of CAG Report Page No
 130) - When looking at the prices of these 14 items, 7 of these items were priced higher, equal to the previous deal of three and four were fixed cheaply
 iske alaava iske element ke daamon kii tulana isliye nahin kii ja sakati he kyonki 2007 or 2015 ke ofer main kaaphi antar tha
 Read here 
 
 CAG report : rafel deal UPA se sasti, 9% kaa modi sarkaar kaa daawa khaarij- report ke anusaar, 2007 or 2016 kii deal main price or dizin main bhi antar rahaa
 According to the 2007 offer, the Rafale that was to come first had 8 engines + spares for 18 aircraft, but later the total of 16 engines in 16 aircrafts totaled 16 engines, while the contractedprice is 12 engines + spares
 (photo- CAG report pej number 130 kaa screen shot)- yahaan report main kaha gaya he ki chunki, kuch chijen bharat main hi DRDO devlep kar rahaa tha
 So the prices of some things were reduced
 iske alaava bhi aircraft spes, ingine spanners main kuch chijen badhaai gai hai, jabaki avinoix spanners main chizon kii kami hui he
 Based on this, the report reads that 17 compared to the old deal with the new deal
 08 fisadi paisa vimaanon par bachaaya gaya he
 Read the ten big things of the CAG report here

 ) The merciless face of the police was seen in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh
 2 naaballig ladakon par pulisavaalon ne pehle to lutpaat kaa aarope lagaaya, phir unhen zanjiron se baandhakar peeta
 The minor boys were beaten so brutally that a boy had to be taken to the hospital
 maamuli iljaam kii barbar sajaakhaaki vardi waalon ne na rapat likhi, na mukadmaa hi darj kiya
 Damoh's police apprehended 2 minor boys in the charge of minor robbery and trample the law with their boots
 police ne donon ladakon ko ghanton bediyon main jakade rakhaa or unke saath jaanwaron se bhi badtar suluk kiya
 The khaki uniforms used to torture the boys in turn
 jagah-jagah jakhm dete rahe
 Ultimately, that is what was expected
 barbarta ladakon kii bardaasht se baahar ho gai or inhen aanan-fanan main aspataal le janaa padaa
 Seeing this brutality in police duty, the police will be shaken by anyone forgetting it, but the police had forgotten that the people they are torturing are minors
 police yah bhi bhul chuki thi ki bacchon ko hiraasat main lene ke baad unke khilaaf maamla bhi darj hona chahie
 The impact of the news of Aaj Tak, the case of ruthlessness of the policemen on the minor boys is slowly becoming hot
 ajtak par khabar dikhaae jane ke baad beraham police waalon par gaaj giri he
 Top police officers have suspended both police constables
 police kii berahami kaa shikaar ek naaballig ladkaa abhi tak aspataal me bhartee he

 com / 02v60lntgc Yamuna Tire has been approved for Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's World Cultural Festival between 11 March and 13 March in Delhi under the shadow of Rs 5 crore
 is aayojan ko kanoonee manzuri mil gai he lekin 5 karod kaa jurmaana isaki naitikta par sawaal nahin khadey karata
 What orders to pay fines to those departments is not light
 vibhaag janata ke paise se hi to jurmaana bharenge
 There will be a Mahasangam of cultures along the banks of the Yamuna, but will it also include the Yamuna
 nadiyon ko maa, mausi kehane ke bhavuk vimarsh main nuksaan nadiyon kaa hi ho rahaa he
 It seems that the culprit is the applicant who reached the tribunal late against the event and the innocent are all those who have no shortage to pay 5 crore as penalty
 neshnal green tribunel ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki aavedak ne tribunel main aane main der kii or yamuna ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai kii ja sakati he isliye aavedak kii ye prarthana sweekaar nahin kii ja sakati ki is kaarykram par roak laga di jaae yaa phir nirmaan saamagree ko hatwa diya jaae
 The tribunal said that the applicant had written to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi in this regard on December 11, but he filed a petition in the court only on February 8, and during this time a lot of construction work was done in the Khadar of Yamuna
 aavedak ne 20 june 2015 ko didie kii ore se di gai ijazat ko bhi chalange nahin kiya naa hi baaki vibhaagon ke un khaton ko jinamein kaha gaya ki kaarykram ke liye unki manzuri kii zarurat nahin he
 The tribunal also said that we do not agree with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's plea that they do not have to approve or give permission for this program
 is maamle main dipisisi apni zimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahaa he isliye us par ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 According to the tribunal's order, the organizers had sought permission from the police, fire brigade, water resources and river development ministry but could not be obtained from anywhere
 jabaki 31 july 2014 ke notification ke mutabik jal sansaadhan mantralay yamuna nadi ke sangrakshan, vikaas, prabandhan or pradooshan niyantran ke liye zimmedaar he
 All these departments have failed to fulfill their responsibilities
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aayojakon ne yah nahin bataaya ki kitne bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Land leveling, roads, pontoon bridges, ramps, parking spaces are being done on a large scale
 40 feet ooncha, 1000 feet lanbaa or 200 feet chaudaa stage banaaya ja rahaa he
 All this goes against the organizer and he will have to pay compensation for it
 adaalat van or paryaavaran mantralay kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin he ki uske vibhaag kii manzuri kii zarurat nahin he jabaki 2006 ke ek notification ke mutabik 50 hectare se zyaada ilaake main kisi bhi kaam ke liye van or paryaavaran mantralay kii manzuri kii zarurat he
 According to the tribunal, experts believe that the Yamuna's floodplain has been tampered with extensively, affecting its natural drift
 yamuna kinare prakritik vanaspati jaise ghaas, sarkandon par asar padaa he, pani main rahane vaale jeev jantu prabhavit hue hai or yamuna ke aasapaas kii water bodies ko nuksaan hua he
 The order also stated that without the permission of the Ministry of Water Resources, the ramp, road, pontoon bridge were built and temporary construction was done
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar se jo ijazat maangi gai uskaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki is bare main ijazat dene ke liye wo sakasham nahin he
 Organizers are responsible for the damage caused to the environment, ecology, river fauna and they are initially fined five crores as compensation for the damage to the environment
 aayojakon ko kaarykram hone se pehle hi ye rakam chukaani hogi
 These amounts will later be adjusted to the final amount of compensation to be decided on the basis of loss
 dilli sarkaar se lekar centre sarkaar ke vibhaag milakar madad karte rahe
 Now everyone from the Union Minister to the Chief Minister is happy that India will be promoted because Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is the Brand Ambassador of India
 faisle ke mutabik art of living ko paanch karod, Delhi Development Authority yani didie par paanch lakh rupye kaa jurmaana laga he
 Delhi Pollution Control Board has been fined one lakh rupees
 ab supreme court kaa hi rasta bachaa he
 The Art of Living says it will go against the decision in appeal because it has not violated the rules on its behalf
 kya sarkari vibhaag bhi jaaenge
 The National Green Tribunal pulled up the Ministry of Forest and Environment before hearing the decision as it had not submitted the affidavit sought on Tuesday
 neshnal green tribunel ne kaha mantralay se saafe nirdesh lekar aaie ki kya yamuna par asthaayee pul banane ke liye ijazat kii zarurat he
 The environment ministry later stated in its affidavit that no environmental clearance is required for the construction of temporary structures in the Yamuna basin
 haalanki isse pehle NGT ko die ek or halafanaame main paryaavaran mantralay kah chukaa tha ki yamuna ke basin main kisi bhi tarah kaa nirmaan gair kanoonee he
 That is, there is no stand of the Ministry of Environment on this matter, whereas the Ministry of Environment has a big responsibility in this matter
 ham paryaavaran mantralay kii site par gaye to vahaan hamen ek vibhaag mila National River Conservation Directorate
 The responsibility of this department is to conserve the rivers, fauna, lakes and wetlands in the country
 iske liye centre sarkaar kii skiimon jaise National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) ko lagu karnaa isaki zimmedaari he
 It is clear on the banks of the Yamuna that the role of this department was not clearly visible during this event
 is aayojan kii swaagat samiti kii suchi dekhni chahie
 Former Supreme Court Justice RC Lahoti, former UN Secretary General Boutras Boutras Ghali, former Prime Minister of Netherlands, former Deputy Prime Minister of India LK Advani, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha Dr Karn Singh, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, Delhi You will find the name of Kapil Mishra, the culture minister of the government, among many foreign mps and celebrities
 NGT ne jal sansaadhan mantralay se bhi poocha ki kya is maamle main unki bhi koi bhoomika he to mantralay ne saafe kah diya ki unki koi bhoomika nahin he
 And this was also said by the Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti outside the Parliament itself
 ab sawaal ye he ki jis mantralay ke paas desh kii nadiyon or uske flud basin ke rakh rakhaav kii zimmedaari ho wo aisa bayaan kaise de saktaa he
 We went to the website of the Ministry of Water Resources
 yahaan apper yamuna river board naam se puraa ek mahakama he jo is mantralay ke tahat aata he
 The board consists of members from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, besides the Central Water Commission
 yamuna main pani ke nunatam bahaav ko sunishchit karne ke liye bane is board kii or bhi kai zimmedaariyaan hai
 These include improving the quality of water above and below ground in Khadar of Yamuna, collecting water flow data in Yamuna basin, monitoring and reviewing all projects up to Okhla barrage in Delhi
 saafe he mantralay ke is vibhaag ne bhi apni koi spasht bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 Not only this, no study of the impact on the environment was done before this event
 indian express ke anusaar pichley saal engiti ne aadesh dekar yamuna ke kinare kisi bhi tarah ke nirmaan par roak laga di thi
 You know that a big movement from Mathura comes to Delhi from time to time to save Yamuna
 tippaniyan In the month of March last year, Mathura Yamuna Muktikaran Padyatra came for Delhi
 jantar mantar par iske sadasyon ne aamaran anshan bhi kiya tha
 They demand that the flow of water in Yamuna should be continuous and uninterrupted
 uma bharti ne inase mulaakaat kar aashwaasan bhi diya tha magar ab aayojakon kaa kahana he ki ek saal main kuch bhi nahin hua
 People of many sects of Mathura, especially those of the Ballabhpur sect, are carrying out the campaign of Yamuna Bachao Braj Bachao
 inhone upie ke samay 2013 main bhi march nikaala tha magar kuch nahin hua
 Then the BJP leaders gave loud speeches on the pretext of this march in Parliament
 endie kii sarkaar ai to inhen laga ki bahut kuch hoga magar abhi tak intazaar hi ho rahaa he
 For 21 years, a campaign to clean Yamuna ji has been going on under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 kuch nahin hua
 At first there was a dispute over the construction of the Akshardham temple, but later everything went right
 phir kaamanwealth game ke dauraan khelgaumv ko lekar vivaad hua baad main sahi ho gaya
 There was also a dispute over the DTC bus depo
 saare vivaadon kii kismat acchhee hoti he
 Later they are corrected
 rahi baat yamuna ji kii to wo sahi nahin ho paati hai
 For the moment, except Yamuna, watch the programs of India's brand ambassador
 jurmaane kii chintaa mat kiijie
 The National Green Tribunal, in its order, has said that the applicant was late in coming to the tribunal and the damages to the Yamuna could be repaid, hence the request of the applicant could not be accepted that the program should be stopped or else Construction materials should be removed
 tribunel ne kaha ki aavedak ne 11 disambar ko dilli ke leftinent governor ko is silsile main likhaa tha lekin court main yachika unhone aath farvari ko hi di or is dauraan yamuna ke khadar main nirmaan kaa kaafii kaam ho chukaa tha
 The applicant did not challenge the dda's approval on 20 June 2015, nor did the other departments' accounts state that their approval was not needed for the program
 tribunel ne ye bhi kaha ki ham dilli pradooshan control cameti kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin hai jisamen kaha gaya ki unhen is kaarykram ke liye ijazat dene yaa naa dene kii zarurat nahin he
 In this case DPCC has failed to fulfill its responsibility and hence a fine of Rs one lakh is imposed on it
 tribunel ke aadesh ke mutabik aayojakon ne police, damakal, jal sansaadhan or nadi vikaas mantralay se ijazat maangi thi lekin kahin se nahin mili
 Whereas according to the notification dated 31 July 2014, the Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for the conservation, development, management and pollution control of the Yamuna River
 kul milakar ye sabhi vibhaag apni zimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahe hai
 The order also said that the organizers did not say how large a scale is happening
 zamin ko samtal karne kaa kaam, sadaken, pontun brij, ramp, parking spes kaa kaam bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Stage is being built 40 feet high, 1000 feet long and 200 feet wide
 ye sab aayojak ke kilaaf jaataa he or iske liye use muawza chukaana hoga
 The court also does not agree with the plea of the Ministry of Forest and Environment that its department does not need approval while according to a 2006 notification, any work in more than 50 hectares area requires the approval of the Ministry of Forest and Environment
 tribunel ke mutabik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yamuna ke flud plane ke saath bade paimaane par chhedchhad kii gai he, uske prakritik bahaav par asar daalaa gaya he
 Natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds have been affected on the banks of the Yamuna, living creatures have been affected in the water, and water bodies around the Yamuna have been damaged
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki jal sansaadhan mantralay kii ijazat ke bagaiyr ramp, road, pontun brij bana die gaye or asthaayee nirmaan kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, the permission sought from the Delhi government has no meaning because it is not able to give permission in this regard
 paryaavaran, paristhitiki, nadi ke jeev jantuon ko hue nuksaan ke liye aayojak zimmedaar hai or paryaavaran ko is nuksaan ke muaavze ke taur par un par shuru main paanch karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The organizers must pay this amount before the event
 ye rakam baad main nuksaan ke aadhaar par tay hone vaale muaavze kii antim rakam main edjust kii jaaegi
 Departments from Delhi Government to Central Government continued to help together
 ab kendriya mantri se lekar mukhyamantri tak sab khush hai ki bharat kaa prachaar hoga kyonki shri shri ravishankar bharat ke brands ambesader hai
 According to the verdict, the Art of Living has been fined five crores, Delhi Development Authority or DDA for five lakh rupees
 dilli pradooshan control board par ek lakh rupye kaa jurmaana kiya gaya he
 Now only the way of Supreme Court is left
 art of living kaa kahana he ki is faisle ke khilaaf apil main jaaegi kyonki usne apni taraf se niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 Will government departments also go
 faisalaa sunaane se pehle neshnal green tribunel ne van or paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii kyonki usne mangalvaar ko maanga gaya halafanama nahin saunpa tha
 The National Green Tribunal said, "please take clear instructions from the ministry whether permission is needed to construct a temporary bridge over the Yamuna
" paryaavaran mantralay ne baad main apane efidavit main kaha ki yamuna ke basin main asthaayee dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran se judi koi manzuri nahin chahie
 However, in another affidavit to the NGT earlier, the Ministry of Environment had said that any construction in the basin of Yamuna is illegal
 yani is maamle par paryaavaran mantralay kaa koi ek stand nahin dikhaa jabaki paryaavaran mantralay kii is maamle main badi jimmedaari banati he
 When we went to the site of the Ministry of Environment, we found a department there National River Conservation Directorate
 is vibhaag kii zimmedaari he desh main nadiyon, unamem rahane vaale jeev jantuon, jhiilon, or wetelends ke sangrakshan kaa kaam karnaa
 For this it is the responsibility of implementing Central Government schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)
 saafe he yamuna kinare is aayojan ke dauraan is vibhaag kii bhoomika kahin spasht dikhaai nahin di
 The reception committee's list of this event should be seen
 supreme court ke purv justise aar si lahoti, sanyukt raashtra sangh ke purv secretary general butaras butaras ghaali ji, netherland ke purv pradhanmantri, bharat ke purv up pradhanmantri laal krishna adwani, rajyasabha main congress saansad doctor karn singh, kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma, dilli sarkaar ke samskruti mantri kapil mishra kaa naam aapako kai videshi saansadon or hastiyon ke bich milegaa
 NGT also asked the Ministry of Water Resources if they have any role in this matter, then the Ministry has clearly said that they have no role
 or ye baat sansad ke baahar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne khud bhi kahi
 Now the question is, how can a ministry that has the responsibility of maintaining the country's rivers and its flood basin make such a statement
 ham jal sansaadhan mantralay kii website par gaye
 There is a complete department called Upper Yamuna River Board which comes under this ministry
 is board main central water kamishan ke alaava uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or dilli ke sadsy hote hai
 This board, made to ensure minimum flow of water in Yamuna, has many other responsibilities
 inamen yamuna ke khadar main zamin ke upar or zamin ke andar pani kii gunvattta ko behatar karnaa, yamuna basin main pani ke bahaav ke aankadon ko jamaa karnaa, dilli main okhla bairaj tak sabhi projects kii nigaraanee or samiksha shaamil he
 It is clear that this department of the ministry also did not play any clear role
 yahi nahin is aayojan se pehle paryaavaran par padane vaale asar kaa koi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 According to the Indian Express, last year, the NGT had given an order prohibiting any kind of construction along the banks of the Yamuna
 aap jaanate hai ki yamuna ko bachaane ko lekar mathura se ek bada andolan samay samay par dilli aata rahata he
 The comments pichley saal march ke maheene main hi mathura yamuna muktikaran padayatra dilli ke liye ai thi
 At Jantar Mantar, its members also went on a fast-unto-death
 inaki maang he ki yamuna main pani kaa bahaav aviral or nirmal ho
 Uma Bharti had met them and assured them, but now the organizers say that nothing happened in a year
 mathura ke kai sampradaayon ke log khaskar ballabhapur sampradaay ke maananevaale yamuna bachaao braj bachaao kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 He also took out a march in 2013 during the UPA but nothing happened
 tab sansad main is march ke bahaane bijepi ke netaaon ne zordaar bhaashan diye the
 When the NDA government came, they thought that a lot will happen, but it is still waiting
 21 saal se supreme court kii nigaraanee main yamuna ji ko saaf karne kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 nothing happen
 pehle vahaan akshardham mandir banane ko lekar vivaad hua magar baad main sab sahi ho gaya
 Then there was a dispute about Khelgaon during the Commonwealth game, which later became correct
 ditisi bas depo ko lekar bhi vivaad ho gaya
 All disputes have good luck
 baad main ve sahi ho jate hai
 If this is the case of Yamuna ji, then she is not right
 philhal yamuna ko chhodiye, bharat ke brands ambesader ke kaarykram dekhiye
 Do not worry about the fine aavedak ne 20 june 2015 ko didie kii ore se di gai ijazat ko bhi chalange nahin kiya naa hi baaki vibhaagon ke un khaton ko jinamein kaha gaya ki kaarykram ke liye unki manzuri kii zarurat nahin he
 The tribunal also said that we do not agree with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's plea that they do not have to approve or give permission for this program
 is maamle main dipisisi apni zimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahaa he isliye us par ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 According to the tribunal's order, the organizers had sought permission from the police, fire brigade, water resources and river development ministry but could not be obtained from anywhere
 jabaki 31 july 2014 ke notification ke mutabik jal sansaadhan mantralay yamuna nadi ke sangrakshan, vikaas, prabandhan or pradooshan niyantran ke liye zimmedaar he
 All these departments have failed to fulfill their responsibilities
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aayojakon ne yah nahin bataaya ki kitne bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Land leveling, roads, pontoon bridges, ramps, parking spaces are being done on a large scale
 40 feet ooncha, 1000 feet lanbaa or 200 feet chaudaa stage banaaya ja rahaa he
 All this goes against the organizer and he will have to pay compensation for it
 adaalat van or paryaavaran mantralay kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin he ki uske vibhaag kii manzuri kii zarurat nahin he jabaki 2006 ke ek notification ke mutabik 50 hectare se zyaada ilaake main kisi bhi kaam ke liye van or paryaavaran mantralay kii manzuri kii zarurat he
 According to the tribunal, experts believe that the Yamuna's floodplain has been tampered with extensively, affecting its natural drift
 yamuna kinare prakritik vanaspati jaise ghaas, sarkandon par asar padaa he, pani main rahane vaale jeev jantu prabhavit hue hai or yamuna ke aasapaas kii water bodies ko nuksaan hua he
 The order also stated that without the permission of the Ministry of Water Resources, the ramp, road, pontoon bridge were built and temporary construction was done
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar se jo ijazat maangi gai uskaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki is bare main ijazat dene ke liye wo sakasham nahin he
 Organizers are responsible for the damage caused to the environment, ecology, river fauna and they are initially fined five crores as compensation for the damage to the environment
 aayojakon ko kaarykram hone se pehle hi ye rakam chukaani hogi
 These amounts will later be adjusted to the final amount of compensation to be decided on the basis of loss
 dilli sarkaar se lekar centre sarkaar ke vibhaag milakar madad karte rahe
 Now everyone from the Union Minister to the Chief Minister is happy that India will be promoted because Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is the Brand Ambassador of India
 faisle ke mutabik art of living ko paanch karod, Delhi Development Authority yani didie par paanch lakh rupye kaa jurmaana laga he
 Delhi Pollution Control Board has been fined one lakh rupees
 ab supreme court kaa hi rasta bachaa he
 The Art of Living says it will go against the decision in appeal because it has not violated the rules on its behalf
 kya sarkari vibhaag bhi jaaenge
 The National Green Tribunal pulled up the Ministry of Forest and Environment before hearing the decision as it had not submitted the affidavit sought on Tuesday
 neshnal green tribunel ne kaha mantralay se saafe nirdesh lekar aaie ki kya yamuna par asthaayee pul banane ke liye ijazat kii zarurat he
 The environment ministry later stated in its affidavit that no environmental clearance is required for the construction of temporary structures in the Yamuna basin
 haalanki isse pehle NGT ko die ek or halafanaame main paryaavaran mantralay kah chukaa tha ki yamuna ke basin main kisi bhi tarah kaa nirmaan gair kanoonee he
 That is, there is no stand of the Ministry of Environment on this matter, whereas the Ministry of Environment has a big responsibility in this matter
 ham paryaavaran mantralay kii site par gaye to vahaan hamen ek vibhaag mila National River Conservation Directorate
 The responsibility of this department is to conserve the rivers, fauna, lakes and wetlands in the country
 iske liye centre sarkaar kii skiimon jaise National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) ko lagu karnaa isaki zimmedaari he
 It is clear on the banks of the Yamuna that the role of this department was not clearly visible during this event
 is aayojan kii swaagat samiti kii suchi dekhni chahie
 Former Supreme Court Justice RC Lahoti, former UN Secretary General Boutras Boutras Ghali, former Prime Minister of Netherlands, former Deputy Prime Minister of India LK Advani, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha Dr Karn Singh, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, Delhi You will find the name of Kapil Mishra, the culture minister of the government, among many foreign mps and celebrities
 NGT ne jal sansaadhan mantralay se bhi poocha ki kya is maamle main unki bhi koi bhoomika he to mantralay ne saafe kah diya ki unki koi bhoomika nahin he
 And this was also said by the Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti outside the Parliament itself
 ab sawaal ye he ki jis mantralay ke paas desh kii nadiyon or uske flud basin ke rakh rakhaav kii zimmedaari ho wo aisa bayaan kaise de saktaa he
 We went to the website of the Ministry of Water Resources
 yahaan apper yamuna river board naam se puraa ek mahakama he jo is mantralay ke tahat aata he
 The board consists of members from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, besides the Central Water Commission
 yamuna main pani ke nunatam bahaav ko sunishchit karne ke liye bane is board kii or bhi kai zimmedaariyaan hai
 These include improving the quality of water above and below ground in Khadar of Yamuna, collecting water flow data in Yamuna basin, monitoring and reviewing all projects up to Okhla barrage in Delhi
 saafe he mantralay ke is vibhaag ne bhi apni koi spasht bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 Not only this, no study of the impact on the environment was done before this event
 indian express ke anusaar pichley saal engiti ne aadesh dekar yamuna ke kinare kisi bhi tarah ke nirmaan par roak laga di thi
 You know that a big movement from Mathura comes to Delhi from time to time to save Yamuna
 tippaniyan In the month of March last year, Mathura Yamuna Muktikaran Padyatra came for Delhi
 jantar mantar par iske sadasyon ne aamaran anshan bhi kiya tha
 They demand that the flow of water in Yamuna should be continuous and uninterrupted
 uma bharti ne inase mulaakaat kar aashwaasan bhi diya tha magar ab aayojakon kaa kahana he ki ek saal main kuch bhi nahin hua
 People of many sects of Mathura, especially those of the Ballabhpur sect, are carrying out the campaign of Yamuna Bachao Braj Bachao
 inhone upie ke samay 2013 main bhi march nikaala tha magar kuch nahin hua

 For 21 years, a campaign to clean Yamuna ji has been going on under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 kuch nahin hua
 At first there was a dispute over the construction of the Akshardham temple, but later everything went right
 phir kaamanwealth game ke dauraan khelgaumv ko lekar vivaad hua baad main sahi ho gaya
 There was also a dispute over the DTC bus depo
 saare vivaadon kii kismat acchhee hoti he
 Later they are corrected
 rahi baat yamuna ji kii to wo sahi nahin ho paati hai
 For the moment, except Yamuna, watch the programs of India's brand ambassador
 jurmaane kii chintaa mat kiijie
 The order also said that the organizers did not say how large a scale is happening
 zamin ko samtal karne kaa kaam, sadaken, pontun brij, ramp, parking spes kaa kaam bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Stage is being built 40 feet high, 1000 feet long and 200 feet wide
 ye sab aayojak ke kilaaf jaataa he or iske liye use muawza chukaana hoga
 The court also does not agree with the plea of the Ministry of Forest and Environment that its department does not need approval while according to a 2006 notification, any work in more than 50 hectares area requires the approval of the Ministry of Forest and Environment
 tribunel ke mutabik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yamuna ke flud plane ke saath bade paimaane par chhedchhad kii gai he, uske prakritik bahaav par asar daalaa gaya he
 Natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds have been affected on the banks of the Yamuna, living creatures have been affected in the water, and water bodies around the Yamuna have been damaged
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki jal sansaadhan mantralay kii ijazat ke bagaiyr ramp, road, pontun brij bana die gaye or asthaayee nirmaan kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, the permission sought from the Delhi government has no meaning because it is not able to give permission in this regard
 paryaavaran, paristhitiki, nadi ke jeev jantuon ko hue nuksaan ke liye aayojak zimmedaar hai or paryaavaran ko is nuksaan ke muaavze ke taur par un par shuru main paanch karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The organizers must pay this amount before the event
 ye rakam baad main nuksaan ke aadhaar par tay hone vaale muaavze kii antim rakam main edjust kii jaaegi
 Departments from Delhi Government to Central Government continued to help together
 ab kendriya mantri se lekar mukhyamantri tak sab khush hai ki bharat kaa prachaar hoga kyonki shri shri ravishankar bharat ke brands ambesader hai
 According to the verdict, the Art of Living has been fined five crores, Delhi Development Authority or DDA for five lakh rupees
 dilli pradooshan control board par ek lakh rupye kaa jurmaana kiya gaya he
 Now only the way of Supreme Court is left
 art of living kaa kahana he ki is faisle ke khilaaf apil main jaaegi kyonki usne apni taraf se niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 Will government departments also go
 faisalaa sunaane se pehle neshnal green tribunel ne van or paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii kyonki usne mangalvaar ko maanga gaya halafanama nahin saunpa tha
 The National Green Tribunal said, "please take clear instructions from the ministry whether permission is needed to construct a temporary bridge over the Yamuna
" paryaavaran mantralay ne baad main apane efidavit main kaha ki yamuna ke basin main asthaayee dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran se judi koi manzuri nahin chahie
 However, in another affidavit to the NGT earlier, the Ministry of Environment had said that any construction in the basin of Yamuna is illegal
 yani is maamle par paryaavaran mantralay kaa koi ek stand nahin dikhaa jabaki paryaavaran mantralay kii is maamle main badi jimmedaari banati he
 When we went to the site of the Ministry of Environment, we found a department there National River Conservation Directorate
 is vibhaag kii zimmedaari he desh main nadiyon, unamem rahane vaale jeev jantuon, jhiilon, or wetelends ke sangrakshan kaa kaam karnaa
 For this it is the responsibility of implementing Central Government schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)
 saafe he yamuna kinare is aayojan ke dauraan is vibhaag kii bhoomika kahin spasht dikhaai nahin di
 The reception committee's list of this event should be seen
 supreme court ke purv justise aar si lahoti, sanyukt raashtra sangh ke purv secretary general butaras butaras ghaali ji, netherland ke purv pradhanmantri, bharat ke purv up pradhanmantri laal krishna adwani, rajyasabha main congress saansad doctor karn singh, kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma, dilli sarkaar ke samskruti mantri kapil mishra kaa naam aapako kai videshi saansadon or hastiyon ke bich milegaa
 NGT also asked the Ministry of Water Resources if they have any role in this matter, then the Ministry has clearly said that they have no role
 or ye baat sansad ke baahar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne khud bhi kahi
 Now the question is, how can a ministry that has the responsibility of maintaining the country's rivers and its flood basin make such a statement
 ham jal sansaadhan mantralay kii website par gaye
 There is a complete department called Upper Yamuna River Board which comes under this ministry
 is board main central water kamishan ke alaava uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or dilli ke sadsy hote hai
 This board, made to ensure minimum flow of water in Yamuna, has many other responsibilities
 inamen yamuna ke khadar main zamin ke upar or zamin ke andar pani kii gunvattta ko behatar karnaa, yamuna basin main pani ke bahaav ke aankadon ko jamaa karnaa, dilli main okhla bairaj tak sabhi projects kii nigaraanee or samiksha shaamil he
 It is clear that this department of the ministry also did not play any clear role
 yahi nahin is aayojan se pehle paryaavaran par padane vaale asar kaa koi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 According to the Indian Express, last year, the NGT had given an order prohibiting any kind of construction along the banks of the Yamuna
 aap jaanate hai ki yamuna ko bachaane ko lekar mathura se ek bada andolan samay samay par dilli aata rahata he
 The comments pichley saal march ke maheene main hi mathura yamuna muktikaran padayatra dilli ke liye ai thi
 At Jantar Mantar, its members also went on a fast-unto-death
 inaki maang he ki yamuna main pani kaa bahaav aviral or nirmal ho
 Uma Bharti had met them and assured them, but now the organizers say that nothing happened in a year
 mathura ke kai sampradaayon ke log khaskar ballabhapur sampradaay ke maananevaale yamuna bachaao braj bachaao kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 He also took out a march in 2013 during the UPA but nothing happened
 tab sansad main is march ke bahaane bijepi ke netaaon ne zordaar bhaashan diye the
 When the NDA government came, they thought that a lot will happen, but it is still waiting
 21 saal se supreme court kii nigaraanee main yamuna ji ko saaf karne kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 nothing happen
 pehle vahaan akshardham mandir banane ko lekar vivaad hua magar baad main sab sahi ho gaya
 Then there was a dispute about Khelgaon during the Commonwealth game, which later became correct
 ditisi bas depo ko lekar bhi vivaad ho gaya
 All disputes have good luck
 baad main ve sahi ho jate hai
 If this is the case of Yamuna ji, then she is not right
 philhal yamuna ko chhodiye, bharat ke brands ambesader ke kaarykram dekhiye
 Do not worry about the fine adaalat van or paryaavaran mantralay kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin he ki uske vibhaag kii manzuri kii zarurat nahin he jabaki 2006 ke ek notification ke mutabik 50 hectare se zyaada ilaake main kisi bhi kaam ke liye van or paryaavaran mantralay kii manzuri kii zarurat he
 According to the tribunal, experts believe that the Yamuna's floodplain has been tampered with extensively, affecting its natural drift
 yamuna kinare prakritik vanaspati jaise ghaas, sarkandon par asar padaa he, pani main rahane vaale jeev jantu prabhavit hue hai or yamuna ke aasapaas kii water bodies ko nuksaan hua he
 The order also stated that without the permission of the Ministry of Water Resources, the ramp, road, pontoon bridge were built and temporary construction was done
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar se jo ijazat maangi gai uskaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki is bare main ijazat dene ke liye wo sakasham nahin he
 Organizers are responsible for the damage caused to the environment, ecology, river fauna and they are initially fined five crores as compensation for the damage to the environment
 aayojakon ko kaarykram hone se pehle hi ye rakam chukaani hogi
 These amounts will later be adjusted to the final amount of compensation to be decided on the basis of loss
 dilli sarkaar se lekar centre sarkaar ke vibhaag milakar madad karte rahe
 Now everyone from the Union Minister to the Chief Minister is happy that India will be promoted because Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is the Brand Ambassador of India
 faisle ke mutabik art of living ko paanch karod, Delhi Development Authority yani didie par paanch lakh rupye kaa jurmaana laga he
 Delhi Pollution Control Board has been fined one lakh rupees
 ab supreme court kaa hi rasta bachaa he
 The Art of Living says it will go against the decision in appeal because it has not violated the rules on its behalf
 kya sarkari vibhaag bhi jaaenge
 The National Green Tribunal pulled up the Ministry of Forest and Environment before hearing the decision as it had not submitted the affidavit sought on Tuesday
 neshnal green tribunel ne kaha mantralay se saafe nirdesh lekar aaie ki kya yamuna par asthaayee pul banane ke liye ijazat kii zarurat he
 The environment ministry later stated in its affidavit that no environmental clearance is required for the construction of temporary structures in the Yamuna basin
 haalanki isse pehle NGT ko die ek or halafanaame main paryaavaran mantralay kah chukaa tha ki yamuna ke basin main kisi bhi tarah kaa nirmaan gair kanoonee he
 That is, there is no stand of the Ministry of Environment on this matter, whereas the Ministry of Environment has a big responsibility in this matter

 If this is the case of Yamuna ji, then she is not right
 philhal yamuna ko chhodiye, bharat ke brands ambesader ke kaarykram dekhiye
 Do not worry about the fine faisalaa sunaane se pehle neshnal green tribunel ne van or paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii kyonki usne mangalvaar ko maanga gaya halafanama nahin saunpa tha
 The National Green Tribunal said, "please take clear instructions from the ministry whether permission is needed to construct a temporary bridge over the Yamuna
" paryaavaran mantralay ne baad main apane efidavit main kaha ki yamuna ke basin main asthaayee dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran se judi koi manzuri nahin chahie
 However, in another affidavit to the NGT earlier, the Ministry of Environment had said that any construction in the basin of Yamuna is illegal
 yani is maamle par paryaavaran mantralay kaa koi ek stand nahin dikhaa jabaki paryaavaran mantralay kii is maamle main badi jimmedaari banati he
 When we went to the site of the Ministry of Environment, we found a department there National River Conservation Directorate
 is vibhaag kii zimmedaari he desh main nadiyon, unamem rahane vaale jeev jantuon, jhiilon, or wetelends ke sangrakshan kaa kaam karnaa
 For this it is the responsibility of implementing Central Government schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)
 saafe he yamuna kinare is aayojan ke dauraan is vibhaag kii bhoomika kahin spasht dikhaai nahin di
 The reception committee's list of this event should be seen

 NGT also asked the Ministry of Water Resources if they have any role in this matter, then the Ministry has clearly said that they have no role
 or ye baat sansad ke baahar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne khud bhi kahi
 Now the question is, how can a ministry that has the responsibility of maintaining the country's rivers and its flood basin make such a statement
 ham jal sansaadhan mantralay kii website par gaye
 There is a complete department called Upper Yamuna River Board which comes under this ministry
 is board main central water kamishan ke alaava uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or dilli ke sadsy hote hai
 This board, made to ensure minimum flow of water in Yamuna, has many other responsibilities
 inamen yamuna ke khadar main zamin ke upar or zamin ke andar pani kii gunvattta ko behatar karnaa, yamuna basin main pani ke bahaav ke aankadon ko jamaa karnaa, dilli main okhla bairaj tak sabhi projects kii nigaraanee or samiksha shaamil he
 It is clear that this department of the ministry also did not play any clear role
 yahi nahin is aayojan se pehle paryaavaran par padane vaale asar kaa koi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 According to the Indian Express, last year, the NGT had given an order prohibiting any kind of construction along the banks of the Yamuna
 aap jaanate hai ki yamuna ko bachaane ko lekar mathura se ek bada andolan samay samay par dilli aata rahata he
 The comments pichley saal march ke maheene main hi mathura yamuna muktikaran padayatra dilli ke liye ai thi
 At Jantar Mantar, its members also went on a fast-unto-death
 inaki maang he ki yamuna main pani kaa bahaav aviral or nirmal ho
 Uma Bharti had met them and assured them, but now the organizers say that nothing happened in a year
 mathura ke kai sampradaayon ke log khaskar ballabhapur sampradaay ke maananevaale yamuna bachaao braj bachaao kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 He also took out a march in 2013 during the UPA but nothing happened
 tab sansad main is march ke bahaane bijepi ke netaaon ne zordaar bhaashan diye the
 When the NDA government came, they thought that a lot will happen, but it is still waiting
 21 saal se supreme court kii nigaraanee main yamuna ji ko saaf karne kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 nothing happen
 pehle vahaan akshardham mandir banane ko lekar vivaad hua magar baad main sab sahi ho gaya
 Then there was a dispute about Khelgaon during the Commonwealth game, which later became correct

 It is clear on the banks of the Yamuna that the role of this department was not clearly visible during this event

 Former Supreme Court Justice RC Lahoti, former UN Secretary General Boutras Boutras Ghali, former Prime Minister of Netherlands, former Deputy Prime Minister of India LK Advani, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha Dr Karn Singh, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, Delhi You will find the name of Kapil Mishra, the culture minister of the government, among many foreign mps and celebrities
 NGT ne jal sansaadhan mantralay se bhi poocha ki kya is maamle main unki bhi koi bhoomika he to mantralay ne saafe kah diya ki unki koi bhoomika nahin he
 And this was also said by the Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti outside the Parliament itself
 ab sawaal ye he ki jis mantralay ke paas desh kii nadiyon or uske flud basin ke rakh rakhaav kii zimmedaari ho wo aisa bayaan kaise de saktaa he

 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) s
 srisanth par lage aaajeevan pratibandh par vichaar karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 BCCI Secretary Anurag Thakur said this in a special conversation with NDTV
 anuraag thakur ne kaha, haalanki bisisiai ab bhi spot phixing ke muddon ko behad gambhirtha se leti he But if anyone wants to discuss it in the next meeting of BCCI, then it can definitely be discussed
 halanki ise ye hargiz na samajha jaae ki srisanth kii aage kii raah aasaan hone vaali he
 According to the BCCI rules, it is not necessary that the court cannot leave the BCCI punishable by those who leave innocent in the absence of evidence
 bisisiai ke kaam karne kaa apana tarika he or court kaa apana
 According to Thakur, there are no strict laws related to fixing in this country, so it becomes very difficult to punish anyone legally in this case, but this does not mean that they cannot punish these players
 dilli kii adaalat ne spot fixing ke mudde par es
 Ever since the acquittals of Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankit Chavan, there has been a question whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India will lift the ban on these players? shuru main bisisiai ne apane tevar bhi dikhaae or kaha ki bhale wo court ke aadesh kaa sammaan karte hai lekin in khilaadiyon par se bain nahin hatega, kyonki bisisiai apni chaanbin main in khilaadiyon ko doshi paa chukaa he
 But after this the Kerala Cricket Association was seen standing with Sreesanth and there was an appeal that the ban on Sreesanth be lifted
 bisisiai kii is pahal ne bhale hi srisanth kii samasyaon ko hal na kiya ho, lekin unke liye ummid kii ek kiran zarur khadi kar di he
 Anurag Thakur said, though BCCI still takes the spot fixing issues very seriously lekin agar koi bisisiai kii agali meeting main is par charchaa karnaa chahta he to is par baat zarur kar sakate hai
 However, it is not to be understood that Sreesanth's road ahead is going to be easy
 bisisiai ke niyamon ke hisaab se ye zaruri nahin ki court jinhen sabooton ke abhaav main begunaah chhod de, unhen bisisiai sazaa nahin de saktaa
 The BCCI has its own way of functioning and the Court has its own way
 thakur kii maane to is desh main phixing ko lekar kade kanoon abhi nahin hai, isliye kisi ko is maamle main kanoonee taur par sazaa dena bahut mushkil ho jaataa he, lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo in khilaadiyon ko sazaa nahin de sakate
 Delhi court on the issue of spot fixing s
 srisanth, ajit chandila or ankit chavaan ko jab se bari kiya he tab se ye sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya bhartiya cricket control board in khilaadiyon se bain hataayega?tippaniyan Initially, BCCI also showed its attitude and said that even though they respect the court order, the ban on these players will not be removed, because BCCI has found these players guilty in their investigation
 lekin iske baad kerala cricket sangh srisanth ke saath khadaa nazar aayaa or vahaan se apil hui ki srisanth par lage pratibandh ko hataa diya jaae
 This BCCI initiative may not have solved Sreesanth's problems, but has certainly created a ray of hope for him
 halanki ise ye hargiz na samajha jaae ki srisanth kii aage kii raah aasaan hone vaali he
 According to the BCCI rules, it is not necessary that the court cannot leave the BCCI punishable by those who leave innocent in the absence of evidence

 com / vvgs4kdynj— Sony Xperia India (@sonyxperiaindia)august 25, 2015 Breaking his silence in the case of Bhopal gas tragedy, Congress leader and then Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Arjun Singh said on Wednesday that several calls were received from the Union Home Ministry to release Warren Anderson, the then head of Union Carbide, and the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did not say a single word in support of Anderson
 arjuna singh ne rajyasabha main bhopal gas traasadee sambandhi ghatnakramon par charchaa main bhaag lete hue kaha ki bhopal kii dharti par kadam rakhte hi anderson ko giraftaar karne kaa nirnay unhone hi kiya tha
 He wanted Anderson to be arrested in this case so that he could be summoned if needed to prosecute him
 singh ne kaha ki us samay halaat aise ho gaye the ki jab anderson hawaii adde par pahunchaa tha to kai mediakarmi or prabhavit logon ke parijanon ko uske aane kaa pataa lag gaya or ve vahaan pahunch gaye the
 It was feared that angry people would beat him to death
 unhone kaha ki giraftaar ke baad rajya ke tatkaaleen mukhya sachiv ne unase kaha ki kendriya grih mantralay se anderson ko chhodane ke liye kai baar phone aa chuke hai
 Singh said that he left the decision to the Chief Secretary
 singh ne kaha ki vah yah baat puri gambhirtha or jimmedaari se kah sakate hai ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne anderson ke samarthan main yaa uski samasya ko dur karne ke liye ek bhi shabd nahin kaha
 Arjun Singh said that Anderson is directly responsible for the tragedy
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko uske pratyrpan ke liye puure prayaas karnaa chahie tathaa haadase ke liye paryaapt evam purna muaavja maanga janaa chahie
 He said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should insist on Anderson's extradition and compensation during the forthcoming visit of US President Barack Obama
 ghatana ke bare main apana paksh rakhte hue singh ne kaha ki unhen yah baat betuki lagi ki anderson sarkari vimaan se bhopal se ravaanaa hua
 But he did not give more details in this matter and said that he does not want to elaborate on this because it will increase the pain and bitterness
 arjuna singh ne kaha ki bhopal haadase ke baad chaar disambar ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi bhopal aaye the
 He had offered his resignation to the Prime Minister but Rajiv Gandhi refused him to do so
 rajeev gandhi ne unase kaha ki iske liye koi bhi mukhyamantri par aarope nahin laga rahaa he
 Singh said that after the tragedy ‘I formed the NK Singh Commission against myself
 ’ unhone kaha ki haadase kii raat unhone vishakt gas ko mahasoos kiya tha or kuch logon ne unhen bhopal chhodkar jane kii salaah di thi
 But he did not leave Bhopal due to being the Chief Minister
 desh ke sabase bade tex rifarm yani jiesti ko lekar dilli ke up-mukhyamantri evam vittamantri manish sisodiya dilli ke vyapaariyon se mili or uske baad media ke saamne alag-alag chizon par lagane vaale tex ko lekar aapattiyaan jataain
 Manish Sisodia said that the GST Act is a very good concept in itself
 hamaari sarkaar kal vidhansabha kaa satr bulaakar is act ko paas bhi karegi
 But he questioned the process of GST and said that the public should not be imposed on GST disaster

 Apart from this, Manish Sisodia also said that increasing the tax on all these things will affect both trade and traders
 trade wing ke adhyakshabrajesh goyal ne bataaya ki vitt mantri (manish sisodiya) ne hamen aashwaasan diya he ki 3 june ko hone vaali jiesti council main in sabhi chizon par badhane vaale tex kaa mudda uthaaenge
 In the absence of hearing on these things, the trade wing has also talked about the peaceful movement
 sabhi vyapaariyon ne jiesti kaa samarthan bhi kiya lekin dilli ke vyapaar ko dhyaan main rakhane kii apil kii
 The ongoing confrontation between Kangana Ranot and Hrithik Roshan is in the news these days and different statements are coming from both sides

 In the event of delimitation, the number of assembly seats in Jammu may increase, in the event of new system and a law of the country, Gurjar and Bakarwal's position may be strengthened and in many assembly constituencies, the role of the deciding voter may come
 jammu-kashmir main ab centre shasit pradesh ke rup main vidhansabha chunaav ladaa jayega
 After delimitation, seats will increase in Jammu while after the new system many political parties can go to Kashmir and contest elections

 This is the case of Noida's Sector-22, where Sanjay's daughter Kashish mysteriously disappeared while playing outside the house in 2016, about three years ago
 us vakt beti kii gumshudagi ko lekar uske parijanon ne police kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaate hue pradarshan bhi kiya tha
 The 4-year-old Kashish family went missing three years ago, says her 4-year-old daughter went missing three years ago

 From the news that is coming out till now, it seems that Kejriwal is serious on these issues and taking the initiative in this direction, he is intending to make a very honest officer his principal secretary

 Kejriwal has been a bureaucrat himself and knows how the files in the government revolve
 agar vah un achche adhikariyon ko saath lekar chalenge, to unke liye kaam thodaa aasaan hoga
 Does Kejriwal want to run a socialist government, is he a supporter of the leftist government or does he want to plunge the state into debt like Bengal? Many such questions are flying in the air and their answers are being sought
 bijli, pani, pakki naukariyon par hone vaale kharch ke bare main jo aankade saamne aae hai unase to kuch aisa hi lagata he kyonki in sab ke liye arabon rupee chahie jo dilli sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 It cannot print notes like the Central Government

 So now wait for the second part of Arvind Kejriwal's magic

 Everyone has played their role very well

 Now they need to work very hard

 But the poor treatment with the story disappoints, which can create obstacles in connecting with the audience

 kal ke episod main hamane dekha ki tanu koshish karti he ki abhi uske saath trial room main adhik samay tak rahe taaki isse vah pragna ko jala sake lekin isamen tanu naakaam ho jaati he
 After readying Pragya in the fitting room, Abhi tells her that she is a perfect wedding material and grandmother will be very happy to find such a daughter-in-law
 is par pragna abhi se puuchhati he ki use khushi nahin hogi
 Abhi is unable to say anything but the mind thinks that she should be with Pragya instead of Tanu
 tippaniyan Tanu and Alia on the other hand come towards the trial room looking for Abhi
 ve donon is baat ko lekar pareshaan hoti hai ki abhi ko apane saath lekar jane main pragna phir kaamyaab ho gai
