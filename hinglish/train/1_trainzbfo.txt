 # Hindi day supreme court ne aaj us yachika par vichaar karne se inkaar kar diya jisamen narendra modi ko gujarat main varsh 2002 main hue dangon kii jaanch ke silsile main vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) dwaara clin chit die jane par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 a bench of justices HL Dattu and SA SA Bobde also refused to consider the plea urging a reorganization of the Special Investigation Team comprising retired judges of the Supreme Court and a person from the minority community
 peeth ne bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ko vishesh jaanch dal dwaara clinit die jane ko chunauti dene vaale aagrah kaa sandarbh dete hue kaha ki is sthiti main vishesh jaanch dal kaa punargathan sahi nahin he
 After this remark by the court bench, advocate Fatima decided to withdraw the petition
 yachika fatima ne hi daakhil kii thi
 It is known that the SIT constituted by the Supreme Court gave a clean chit to Modi in 2012 in the Gulberg Society riots case
 esaiti kii report ke virodh main dange main maare gaye purv congress saansad jakia jaafaree kii patni ne yachika daakhil kii thi, lekin nichali court ne disambar 2013 main modi ko clin chit dene vaali esaiti kii closer report par muhar laga di thi
 In the closure report, the SIT had said that it had not found any evidence against Modi
 jakia jaafaree kaa kahana he ki is maamle main modi samet duusare netaaon, police adhikariyon or naukarshahon ke khilaaf abhiyojan chalaane ke liye paryaapt saboot hai
 Ekadashi of Shukla Paksha of Falgun month is called Amalaki Ekadashi
 aamalki yani aanwala ko shastron main shreshth sthaan praapt he
 When Vishnu gave birth to Brahma to create the creation, at the same time he gave birth to the Amla tree
 aanwale ko bhagwaan vishnu ne aadi vriksh ke rup main pratishthit kiya he
 In every part of it, the place of God is considered
 somvaar ko aamalki ekadshi he, shani kaa nakshatra pushya bhi he
 Pushya is considered the king of constellations
 aamalki ekadshi vishnu bhagwaan kaa din hota he
 One should worship Shiva on this day
 jaaniye aamalki ekadshi main laabh paane ke upaay
 Amla Ekadashi fast worshiping Amla has special significance in Amalki Ekadashi
 is din pujan se lekar bhojan tak har kaary main aanwale kaa upyog hota he
 On this day, wake up in the morning and meditate on Lord Vishnu and resolve to fast
 vrath kaa sankalp lene ke baad snaan aadi se nivrutt hokar bhagwaan vishnu kii puja karnaa chahie
 Recite Vishnu Sahasranama, lamp lamp of ghee
 ghar main kachua rakhane ke hai kai laabh, par jarur rakhen disha kaa dhyanpuja ke baad aanwale ke vriksh ke neeche navratna yukt kalash sthapit karnaa chahie
 If Amla tree is not available, then offer Amla fruit to Lord Vishnu as a Prasad
 aanwale ke vriksh kaa dhoop, deep, chandan, roli, pushp, akshat aadi se pujan kar uske neeche kisi garib, zaruratmand vyakti yaa brahman ko bhojan karana chahie
 Jain Mahakumbh: Who were Lord Bahubali, know the real story, on the next day i
e
 after bathing in Dwadashi, after worshiping Lord Vishnu, the person or Brahmin should donate the urn, clothes and amla etc
 iske baad bhojan grahan kar upwas kholana chahie
 According to the importance of the Amalaki Ekadashi fast, observing Amalaki Ekadashi fasting gives a virtue similar to hundreds of pilgrimage
 samast yagyon ke baraabar fal dene vaale aamalki ekadshi vrath ko karne se vyakti ko moksh kii prapti hoti he
 Those who do not observe Amalaki Ekadashi fast should also offer Amla to Lord Vishnu on this Ekadashi and eat it themselves
 shastron ke anusaar aamalki ekadshi ke din aanwale kaa seven karnaa bahut laabhakaari hota he

 Aye Mere Watan's Facebookers and Twitterers, today we will talk about Rahul Gandhi
 apni pratikriyaayein zarur dijiega
 Criticisms would be more welcome
 rahul gandhi kii charchaa isliye nahin ki haal hi main unhone akhbaar or television ko intervyuu diya
 But, in terms of how often the Congress will pre-launch, launch and re-launch them
 haal ke eisisi seshan main jab rahul gandhi ganjon ko kanghee bechney jaise jumale bolte sune gaye to ye baat saafe ho gai ki wo bhi narendra modi kii tarah jumalebaazi kar sakate hai
 When he told the entire Congress in the presence of Manmohan Singh that nine cylinders will not work, we need 12 cylinders, it seems that Rahul Gandhi has learned to speak the language of Netagiri
 lekin, phir bhi rahul gandhi kii jitani chamak dikhni chahie vah nahin dikh rahi he
 Despite this, in the coming times, the prospects of Manmohan Singh's comeback are very less and the whole party is standing behind Rahul Gandhi
 akhbaaron main lagaataar die ja rahe vigyapanon se lekar bayanon tak sab rahul ke haq main he, lekin vah janjudaav kii dahleez tak nahin pahunch paae hai
 Is Congress expecting more than Rahul Gandhi? Let's see the discussion

 yah kisi thos aadhaar par liya gaya nirnay nahin he

 Necessary preparation was also not done for this

 No legal framework has yet been prepared for regularization of teachers
 cabinet dwaara paarit bill thos aadhaar par prastaavit na hokar kaccha-pakkaa he or isamen itnaa dam nahin ki vah nyaaypalika or kanoonee prakriya par khara utar sake
 This is political manipulation to mislead people

 Along with this, the level of education is being affected

 dilli vidhansabha kaa bajet satr mangalvaar ko khatm ho gaya
 Even on the last day of the session, the BJP mlas wanted to discuss the shortage of water in Delhi, but due to the frequent uproar, the speaker, with the help of marshals, removed the BJP mlas from the House
 iske baad netaa pratipaksh vijendra gupta ne kaha ki dilli jal board ke adhyaksh ormukhyamantri kejarivaldilli main pani kii kami or siver mili hue gande pani kii supplai par charchaa karne se bhaag rahe hai
 Vijender Gupta said that the agenda was listed on the agenda today from 3 to 4 pm and the government was supposed to respond to it, but by 5 pm, Chief Minister Kejriwal did not come to Parliament when the opposition demanded a discussion on the water issue but the speaker Asked not to discuss the issue of water and when BJP mlas showed dirty bottles of water in the House and the Chief Minister was present in the House The pass was adjourned the House for half an hour then sought to answer
 aadhe ghante ke baad jab sadan phir se shuru hua tab bijepi vidhayakon ne phir se pani kii kami or gande pani kii supplai kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karaayaa
 He again showed dirty water bottles and demanded a discussion in the House
 is baar bijepi vidhayakon ne gale main takhtiyaan bhi pahani thim jin par likhaa tha- 'dilli pyaasi, gande pani se bura haal, vidhaan sabha se gaayab kejariwal'
 But this time the speaker, with the help of marshals, asked Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta, OP Sharma, Jagdish Pradhan and Manjinder Singh Sirsa to leave the House
 sadan se baahar aane ke baad vipakshi netaaon ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar janhit ke mudde par jawaab dene se bhaag rahi he or kejariwal sarkaar dilli main pani kii samasya se nipatane ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta demanded his resignation accusing Kejriwal of running away from the water issue
 dalte siyaasi sameekaran ne nau maheene ke liye jithan ram maanjhi ko bihar kaa mukhyamantri bana diya
 This change led him to rebel against JD (U) Nitish Kumar and due to this, resigned from his post before the power test in the assembly and finally gave up
 is kram main maanjhi apni naiya bhale hi dubo baithe lekin unhone mahadaliton ko rajya kii raajnneeti main mahatvapurn bana diya
 However, just two months after becoming the Chief Minister, Manjhi's attitude had changed and he was trying to tarnish Nitish's image among the Mahadalits
 jaahir he, isse sabase zyada khush bijepi thi
 It is believed that the script of the revolt's drama was prepared by the BJP, Manjhi was just a pawn
 vidhansabha main shakti pradarshan kii purv sandhya par, sankhyabal puri tarah nitish kumaar ke saath tha
 He had a parade of 97 JD (U) mlas in his favor, and had the support of Lalu Prasad's RJD (24 mlas), Congress (5), CPI (1) and two independents in the 233-member house
 Had finished 87 vidhayakon vaali bijepi bahumat ke liye jaruri 30 or vidhayakon ko apane saath laane kii sthiti main nahin thi
 However, till the last moment, the party kept everyone guessing whether it would support Manjhi
 lekin bihar main khel ab shuru hoga—or yah khel kaaphi had tak 70 varshiya maanjhi, or jedy (you) se vah jitani sankhya main vot le sakenge, uske idgird ghumta rahegaa
 The BJP tried to put Manjhi's ambitions and Manjhi's arrogance to the very verge by announcing that Nitish Kumar had insulted the Mahadalit communities and that she would avenge it
 bijepi ko ummid he ki mahadalit vot katkar maanjhi nitish kumaar ko jitna nuksaan pahunchaayenge, usase nibatane ke liye nitish kumaar ko utani hi mushkil ladaai ladani hogi
 Ironically, a sub-division of the 22 'poorest Dalit' castes — Mahadalit — was created by Nitish Kumar in 2007 as chief minister
 ummid he ki aane vaale maheenon main bijepi maanjhi se baat karegi, unhen apni swayan kii party banane ke liye prerit karegi, or isi ke saath chunavi maidan thodaa or khul jayega
 Justifying supporting Manjhi, a top NDA leader from Bihar said, "the enemy of our enemy will be our friend
" ''2013 main nitish or bijepi kii raahen alag hone ke pehle tak up-mukhyamantri rahe susheel kumaar modi ne 16 farvari ko kaha tha, ''ham agle chah maheene tak vipaksh main rahenge
 We are not going to form any government in Bihar
 '' is tarah antim khel 2015 kii sardiyon tak khele jane ke liye taiyaar najar aata he, jisamen bijepi ko ummid hogi ki maanjhi nitish kaa aadhaar khiskaa denge
 Caste mathematics will not be easy for whoever will succeed Manjhi
 yah ganit prayek khand kii jatigat or dharmik sanrachana kii napjokh kaa hoga, or is bare main hoga ki kise kitna laabh hoga
 BJP leaders believe that Manjhi becomes important in this math with his Mahadalit identity, which he hopes will help him to demolish the lalu-nitish fort
 isaki kilabandi pichde-muslim-mahadalit ke shashakt vot bank ne kii hui he
 An analysis of the results of the Lok Sabha election shows that a large proportion of the voters belonging to the Backward Castes (EBC) had joined the BJP except the JD (U), but the Mahadalits had stayed with the JD (U)
 rajya main ranneeti banane ke liye jimmedaar sheersh bijepi netaa kehete hai, ''hamaare aakalnon se sanket miltaa he ki mahadaliton ne thok main (lagbhag 90 pratishat) nitish ke paksh main vot diya tha
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi believes that BJP has got an answer on Nitish Kumar's sway among Mahadalits
 unhone 16 farvari ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''jaise hi jedy (you) ne jithan ram maanjhi ke khilaaf karrwai kii, rajya bhar main kuch sau sthanon par party ke khilaaf swat:sfoort pradarshan hue
 What does this indicate? That Manjhi has become a Dalit icon
 ''agar maanjhi vastav main mahadalit voton kaa acha-khaasaa hissaa bhi le lete hai, to rajya ke bijepi netaaon ke liye yah badla le lene jaisaa hoga, jo hameshaa is baat kaa durbhaav man main paale hue hai ki nitish unhen har myanon main ek kanishtha bhagidaar samajhate rahe the
 However, in the mid-1990s, when Nitish was on the verge of political collapse after ending relations with Lalu Prasad, his political stature was enhanced by the BJP by projecting him as the leader of the anti-lalu front
 agle chah yaa aath maheenon main jis bhi disha main hawa chale, nitish ke liye pichley dashak ke mad bhare dinon ke lautne kii sambhaavna nahin he
 After winning the 2005 assembly elections and then the NDA winning 32 of the state's 40 seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish launched a support among minorities and Mahadalits in 2010 by isolating the Paswan caste, one of the prominent Dalits
 Aadhaar was prepared and then had his party contest elections in 141 assembly seats
 24 november, 2010 ko jab vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi, to aisa lag rahaa tha jaise nitish koi galati kar hi nahin sakate—bijepi ke saath gathbandhan main unki jedy (you) ne akele 65
 Over 6 lakhs, or 22 of the total
 58 pratishat vot hasil kiye the
 He had complete collapse in less than four years
 june, 2013 main endie se alag hone ke baad isibi-mahadalit-alpsankhyak janaadhar ke bharose nitish 2014 ke aam chunaav main akele utre
 JD (U) was reduced to just two seats from the 20 seats it got in 2009
 yahaan tak ki use mili voton kii sankhya main bhi kami ai (58 lakh se adhik se ghatakar 56
 6 lakhs)
 haalanki party 37 siton par chunaav ladi thi, jo 2009 kii tulana main 12 adhik thim
 While RJD received more than 72 lakh votes
 jab party kii qamar tuuti hui thi, to nitish ko is ganit main ummid kii kiran najar ai- jedy (you) or argedy ko milakar bijepi se zyada vot mili the, or nitish ko ummid he ki aktubar-november ke aasapaas hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye ve is janaadhar ko majboot kar lenge
 This is precisely the point where Manjhi becomes important
 bijepi ko ummid he ki nitish kaa soshal ejineering formula is baar dhwast hona tay he
 However, it is not uncommon for the politics of Bihar to become king again from Ranka

 Let us tell you that Prime Minister Modi has participated in the centenary celebrations of Patna University on Saturday
 jahaan piem modi ne desh kii 20 uniwarsity ke liye 10 hajaar karod rupye ke funda kaa elaan kiya
 Also, PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of various schemes costing about Rs 3,700 crore in Nawada
 kaale dhan ke khilaaf pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shuru kiye gaye ''shuddhikaran abhiyaan" ke thik agle din desh ke upar tabaahi ke kaale badal ghir aae
 The poisonous smog thickened, the toxic fine particles in the air became so dense that it was impossible to measure them with standard equipment
 iske baad 10 november ko kareeb 1,400 schuli bacchon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhakar maang kii ki desh main ek rashtriya svachh hawa diwas ghoshit kiya jaae
 Although this letter written by the children could not be made news, but the school children showed that they too are undoubtedly a part of the collective subconscious
 hawa kii shuddhi se kahin zyada is desh main hameshaa shuddhikaran ke karmkand kaa bolbalaa rahaa he
 Ideas like Karma, Yoga, Ayurveda have always fascinated this country
 kachare se lekar kaale dhan tak har gandi cheez ko desh se saaf karne ke pradhanmantri ke vaade kii roshni main is desh ke mood ko anken to kah sakate hai ki jindagi, swatantraaa or sukh-shanti se jude masalon ke ird-gird logon ko ab bhi thodi- bahut ummiden hai
 In the first mood survey of the country after the commencement of Prime Minister Modi's tenure, the concern of the people was largely about the increase in communalism, politics on school books and sexual crimes
 2015 or 2016 main logon kaa dhyaan berogari, mahangaai, bhrashtachar ke maamalon or sampradayik tanaav par tha
 However, this year, it seems that these things have gone completely out of people's minds
 logon ne apni praathamiktaayen jaahir kar di haih pradooshit hawa or pani, aspataalon kii khasta haalat or badahaal skulon se lekar kanoon-vyavastha or nyaay ab unki praathamikta he
 70 per cent of the people surveyed believe that air and water pollution is a matter of concern and 32 per cent of them consider it a "very serious matter"
 65 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki netaaon kaa logon ke jivan kii asli sthitiyon se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or inamen 18 fisadi kaa kahana he ki ''netaa unheen muddon kii chintaa karte hai, jo unhen vot dilava saken
 "these concerns of the people are justified because the World Health Organization's" Global Burden of Disease "report in mid-november says that India has overtaken China for the first time in deaths due to air pollution
 pehali baar aisa hua he ki yahaan kii hawa main ausat pradooshnakaari kanon kii maatra china kii hawa se zyada ho gai he
 This does not mean that things are out of tolerance because more than half of the people also say that their standard of living has improved and these people are also giving credit to the Center for the services which are under the purview of the state government
 She comes
 58 fisadi log yah maanate hai ki modi ke raaj main skulon kii haalat sudhari he, jabaki 59 fisadi logon kii yahi raay aspataalon ke bare main he
 However, the factual truth is that more such things are coming from the BJP ruled East and West states
 sarkaar ke saath do saal se sangharsh kar rahi nyaaypalika apni jagah kaayam he
 More than judicial corruption, more people complain about the lack of courts and judges, which they consider to be the biggest obstacle in the country's judicial system
 kul 64 fisadi log haal hi main supreme court ke cinemagharon main anivaary kiye gaye raashtragan bajaae jane ke faisle ke samarthan main hai
 On December 31, after fifty days of demonetisation, the Prime Minister said in his address to the nation, "the example of what India has done is nowhere in the world

 ab peedit pita ne insaaf kii guhaar lagaate hue dm se shikaayat karne ke saath hi sadak par bheekh maangane kaa faisla liya he
 What's the matter? Haji Sagir Ahmed's son Shahzan was a class VIII student at the prestigious St
 Francis of Agra school
 uske fail hone par skool prashasan ne use tisi thama di thi
 After this, father Sagir had asked the school management to promote the son, citing the Continuous and Comprehensive Evolution Rules
 unke mutabik, ve kai baar skool gaye, lekin sunwaayee nahin hui
 He then sought a report from the Secondary Joint Education Director Agra Seshiyataki and the school, but the school administration did not respond
 beete 18 april ko sagir khan ne adhivaktaa ke madhyam se skool prabandhan ko notice bheja
 Along with this, a letter from the Ministry of Human Institutions Development was also attached, which mentions the passing of the student up to class VIII
 15 din main jamaa karaae 1 karod rupenotice ke madhyam se poocha gaya ki kis niyam ke tahat shahjan ko fail kiya he? lekin, skool ne notice kaa bhi koi jawaab nahin diya
 On this, Sagir sent a reminder of the notice to the principal on 28 April
 notice ke jawaab ke badale skool prashasan ke adhivaktaa kii ore se 6 may ko chaatr ke adhivaktaa ke naam notice bheja gaya
 It said that the school is outside the purview of the right to education due to being a minority college
 saath hi notice bhejne or jhuthe aarope lagane kii baat kehete hue chaatr par ek karod rupee kii rakam 15 din ke andar adaa karne kii baat kahi gai
 The DM handed over the investigation to the City Magistrate, saying that they were opposing the unreasonable demands of the school
 isi vajah se skool prashasan unase puraani ranjish rakhata he
 In fact, in 2014, he had instructed the school to deposit Rs 300 from the students
 is par unhone sistar se poocha ki kis baat ke rupee liye ja rahe hai
 Sister said that it does not make any sense to you what rupees are being taken
 aapako raseed de rahe hai, bas baat khatm ho gai
 He said that since then the school administration had started retaining him
 is vajah se jaanboojhkar unke bete ko fail karke ek karod kaa notice thama diya
 The victim's family decided to beg, the victim's father says that if he sells his house even once, he cannot raise Rs 1 crore, while the school lobby is very strong
 aise main ve lambii kanoonee ladaai bhi nahin lard sakate
 They do not have the capacity to be expensive lawyers
 ab ve ek karod rupee jutaney ke liye apane parivaar ke saath mandir, carch, gurudware or masjid par baithkar bheekh maangenge
 When he complained to DM Agra, DM handed over the investigation to the City Magistrate
 chaatr shahjan kaa kahana he ki use jaanboojhkar skool ne fail kiya he
 Three of the eight subjects had his retest, in which he also appeared
 iske baad bhi usko fail kar diya or tisi de di
 What does the school side say? School side lawyer Surendra Gupta says that notice was issued on behalf of student's father Sagir
 isamen aarope lagaaya ki skool dwaara gaiyrkanoonee ugaahi kii jaati he
 The school has a reputation in surrounding districts including Agra
 ise dekhte hue itnaa gambhir aarope lagaana ek badi baat he
 The school administration is not in a position to tolerate this
 skool kaa apmaan hua he
 For this reason, in response to the notice, compensation has been demanded for this amount

 ham or sachin bhi sunil gavaskar, gundappa vishwanath jaise khilaadiyon ko adarsh maanate the

 vah jis tarah se tej gendbaajon par dabadabaa banaate the, yah tarika bilkul alag tha

 ' The Supreme Court has ordered a CBI inquiry into the alleged fake murders in the Tulsiram Prajapati case involving Gujarat
 prajapati soharabuddin shaikh farji muthbhed maamle kaa pratyakshdarshi tha
 The name of former state minister Amit Shahka is reportedly associated with this massacre
 nyaayamurti pi sadashivam or nyaayamurti bi es chouhan kii peeth ne gujarat sarkaar kii is yachika ko khaarij kar diya ki is maamle main sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh nahin diya ja saktaa kyonki pradesh police ne is maamle main pehle hi aaropapatr daayar kiya hua he
 An appeal was filed in this regard by Prajapati's mother Narmada Bai
 apil main aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki gujarat police ne prajapati ko kathith taur par farji muthbhed main maar diya kyonki vah soharabuddin or uski patni kausar bi kii hatya kaa pratyakshdarshi tha
 The court said that the petitioner has presented this case very forcefully to transfer the CBI as there are many doubts related to the involvement of the police of three states, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat in this case
 peeth ne haalanki yah spasht kar diya ki is faisle main jo bhi vichaar die gaye hai, unka is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi nichali adaalat par koi prabhaav nahin hoga
 The court also criticized the Gujarat police's slow investigation into the murder
 peeth ne is baat par bhi khed vyakt kiya ki pradesh police ne hatya ke baad aaropapatr daayar karne main saadhe teen saal se bhi zyada kaa samay liya
 The Gujarat government opposed the CBI probe on the grounds that Prajapati's murder was a separate case of encounter and was not related to the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case
 peeth ne 15 march ko is maamle main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 The Gujarat government and Shah had opposed the handing over of the case to the CBI on the grounds that the Center was trying to implicate former minister Shah and Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the matter
 haalanki sibiai kii ore se pesh varisht vakil ke tii es tulsi or narmada bai ke vakil ne is maamle ko sibiai ko saunpe jane ko nyaaysangat tehra diya
 He argued that the Gujarat Police investigation was 'partisan' and that Prajapati's murder was a case related to Sohrabuddin's murder

 Union Finance Minister and BJP leader Arun Jaitley has once again targeted the opposition grand alliance through his blog
 mahagathbandhan par tanj karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki mahagathbandhan main koi bandhan nahin he or yah siyaasi sarkas he
 Several political parties, including parties traditionally opposed to the BJP, have come together against the NDA in the general elections starting on 11 April
 arun jetali ne blog par likhaa ki beete kai maheenon se bharat mahagathbandhan kii baton se ub chukaa he
 He said that the reasoning behind this is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP are very strong and no single party can challenge them
 jetali ne jor diya ki bhartiya log netaaon kaa moolyankan unki gunvattta or kshamta se karte hai, kisi paramparik judaav se nahin
 Everywhere the Finance Minister said, 'we were promised a coalition of opponents because India had to be saved
 hamen kaaman minimum program kaa vaada kiya gaya
 Every leader aspiring to become Prime Minister wanted to be the architect of the alliance
 ve apane rajya main sho kaa aayojan karenge or puure samooh ko aamantrit karenge
 The agenda to remove Modi said that there is an impasse over leadership in the opposition camp as many candidates have already shown willingness to take the leadership into their own hands
 unhone mahagathbandhan naam kaa raajnneetik sarkas naam ke blog main kaha ki sthirataa sarvopari he jo badi pareshaani he
 Shared talk is a negative agenda to 'remove a person', it is a formula of chaos

 Referring to UP, he wrote that the Congress has been separated from the SP-BSP alliance here

 Regarding Bihar, Jaitley writes that here Congress has beaten up some of our well-known leaders and we thank them because they were a problem for us

 In Odisha, the Congress is fighting for the third position due to finding no partner

 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann is not taking the name of diminishing difficulties in the matter of making a video of Parliament House and uploading it on Facebook

 Bhansali worked closely on everything about the film
 film bhavy set, costums, drametic seen or soundtrack par behtareen kaam hua tha
 Devdas was the highest grossing film of that year in terms of earnings
 devdas main shahrukh landan se lau kii padhai kar bachapan ke pyaar paro se shaadi karne ke liye bharat waapas lautate hai
 Meanwhile, Shahrukh's housemates do not let him marry Paro, then he gets drunk and starts ruining himself
 isamen maadhuri ne tawayph chandramukhi kaa role play kiya tha jo shahrukh ke pyaar main pad jaati he
 According to the reports, Devdas is said to be the most expensive film at that time
 iskaa bajet kareeb 50 karod tha
 It also starred Kiran Kher, Jackie Shrop and Smita Jayakar
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ne 30 june ko kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa elaan kiya tha
 He was then expected to pay Rs 32,020 crore
 kii is 'aitihaasik' karj maafee kaa phayda 89 lakh kisaanon ko milegaa
 But it was learned that till the last date of 22 September, only 58 lakh farmers have applied for loan waiver
 sarkari adhikari kehete hai ki karj maafee ke vaade ke tahat kam liwaalon kaa aage aana hairaan karne vaali baat he
 a big officer of the cooperative department is aware of the scam: It may be that the district cooperative banks have opened fake or benami accounts of farmers who do not exist
 karj maafee ke hakdaar kisaanon kii taadaad inhen bainkon se muhaiyaa kiye gaye aankadon kii bina par nikaali gai thi
 "it is possible that they (the bank officials) have overstated the figures," says an officer
 ''pehle kii yojanaon main rakam sidhe bainkon main jamaa kar di jaati thi
 But this time the amount of loan waiver has to be known directly in the accounts of different farmers and that too after confirming their Aadhaar identification
 iske liye online arji kii prakriya mukarrar kii gai jisamen kisaanon ke liye jameen kii milkiyat ke saboot ke saath unke aadhaar number ke kagajaat dena anivaary kar diya gaya
 Principal Secretary of State Government Information Technology Department V
 ke
 Gautam says that applicants who have not submitted their Aadhaar details will not be entitled to loan waiver
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kisaanon ko aadhaar card kii nakal pesh karne ke liye ek or mauka diya jayega
 However, the Minister of Agriculture, Pandurang Phundkar, gives another reason for less applications than Uquamid
 unke mutabik, kai kisaan pariwaron main bhaaiyon ke bich jot kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa he par kaagajon par milkiyat nahin badali
 "there are many such cases in Vidarbha and Marathwada," says Phundkar
 khet kii jameen kaa maalik hi chunki karj maafee kaa hakdaar he isliye dusron ko labhaarthi nahin mana jaataa
 However, the loan is given to the family as a unit
 kisaanon ke sanghathanon ne bhi aadhaar ke jariye tasdik kii mukhaalafat kii he

 The chain of irresponsible statements after the Delhi gang rape is still not stopped
 taaja misaal he mumbai ke police kamishnar satyapal singh kii
 Satyapal Singh says that educational institutions are guilty for incidents like gang rape
 sanskaron kii duhai dekar kis tarah se apni khaal bachaai jaati he, koi mumbai police ke mukhiya se puche
 Police commissioner Satyapal Singh called the compulsion the name of education and announced that nothing is behind the Delhi gang-rape that shook the country, and taught school
 kamishnar ne kaha ki dilli ke andar jo gangrape hua wo apsamskruti kaa parinaam he
 The education that is imparted in our schools is given without rites, no one teaches the value of life
 koi satyapal singh se puche, dilli gangrape kanoon-vyavastha kaa masalaa kyon nahin he
 The philosopher's mind of Commissioner Satyapal, why did the police not consider this incident at nine thirty in the night as a matter of negligence? Has it not happened once in Satyapal Singh's mind that even the children who have shaken the rule of the historical sentiments on the death of an unnamed girl have grown up in the school environment of this country
 bal kii khaal nikaalte hue vardi ko bedaag tehraane kii koshish main satyapal singh ne usee tarah tark die jaise ek jhooth ko chhipaane ke liye kai jhooth bolne padate hai

 anpadh log aatmahatya nahin karte or jo angreji padhate hai ve aatmahatya karte hai
 i do not know which studies have taught the commissioner that from inside the figures, the meaning of the place of meaning is found

 kaante kii sitembijapi ne jo 18 siten jeetin hai vahaan trinmul duusare number par rahi he
 Of these, there are 7 seats where the difference of votes between the two is only 5% or less

 Based on the results of the Lok Sabha, diu found that there are 20 such seats where Trinamool has got more votes than BJP

 com / nbz3v1j8yw Senior BJP leaders LK Advani and Narendra Modi appeared side-by-side on the issue of compulsory voting and after being bitter over the Gujarat Chief Minister being made the party's prime ministerial candidate, Advani said voting with the option 'none of these' Should be made mandatory
 adwani ne apane taaja blog main supreme court ke us suzav kaa swaagat kiya ki logon ko nakaaratmak matdaan kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 He, however, said that the provision of voting should be made mandatory
 adwani ne kaha, ‘aaj jo sthiti he, vah matadaata jo samvidhan pradutt apana mat dene ke bahumoolya adhikaar kaa bina kisi vaid kaaran ke upyog nahin karata he, anachaahe hi sabhi ummidavaaron ke khilaaf nakaaratmak vot detaa he
 'he said,' Therefore i believe that a negative vote would be meaningful if at the same time voting is made compulsory
 ' Layers of Punjab National Bank Mahaghotale are being opened minute by minute
 kareeb saadhe 11 hajaar karod ke is ghotaale main bainkon ke kuch niyamon kaa durupyog karne kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 Ignoring systems like letter of undertaking and swift transfer are responsible for this scam
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai ki letters of anderteking (lou) or swift kya he or kaise ye tranjaction hote hai
 What is lou? Letter of Undertaking (lou) is a kind of bank guarantee
 yah aayaat ke liye oversij bhugtan karne ke liye jari kiya jaataa he
 The issuing bank of the lou becomes the guarantor and accepts the principal amount on its client's loan and the unpaid interest on it
 jabantou jaarikia jaataa he to isamen ise jari karne vaala bank, sweekaar karne vaala bank, ayatak or videsh main isse labhanvit hone vaali company shaamil hoti he
 In the case of PNB, fake lous were obtained and based on these loans were taken from foreign branches of banks like Axis and Allahabad
 SWIFT kaa bhi kiya durupyogbataya ja rahaa he ki rakam kii len-dein ke liye pienbi ke karmchaariyon ne 'SWIFT' kaa bhi durupyog kiya
 Through this, they dodged the core banking system (CBS) that processes daily banking transactions
 iske jariye unhone lous par di jane vaali guarantee ko jaruri manjuuri ke bina hi paas kar liya
 On the basis of this, branches abroad of Indian banks gave loans
 SWIFT kya he?jab bhi kisi bank kii taraf se lou jari kiya jaataa he
 After this, the information about the credit transfer is given to the bank located abroad
 yah jaankaree SWIFT (society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) vyavastha ke jariye di jaati he
 This is an important information through which the bank gives its consent and guarantee
 swift kii jaankaree dene ke liye bank adhikari colog inkarna padataa he or isamen gopneey jaankaree darj kerani padati he
 This includes the account number and SWIFT code
 saamaanya taur par isamen teen layer hote hai
 The Core Banking System (CBS) consists of a 'maker (code creator), checker (checker) and verifier (information taker), which is released only after passing
 darasal, 'swift' se jude massej pienbi ke pinaikal software system main tatkaal trek nahin hote hai kyonki ye bank ke CBS main entry kiye bina jari kiye jate hai
 Two PNB employees took advantage of this and made transactions worth crores
 CBS kya ?kor banking system athwa sibies vah system hota he, jisase bank kii sabhi shakhaaen judi hoti hai
 It is CBS, due to which you are able to operate your account and send money from any branch of the bank
 is vyavastha ke aane ke baad aap ek branch ke nahin, balki sidhe bank ke graahak ban jate hai
 Here every transaction in banking system is updated on real time
 pienbi mahaghotaleke maamle main sibies ke paas karmchaariyon ne tranjaction kii detail bheji hi nahin
 This was the reason why the bank could not find the scam at that time

 What can be more shameful that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stealing the money of the army which is currently protecting the country
 modi sirf senaaon kaa dhan hi chori nahin kar rahe hai balki vah kisaanon se, mazdooron se or adivaasiyon se unki jangal or jameen bhi chori kar rahe hai

 june akhaada ke mahamandaleshwar or bahucharchit sant payalat baba chini dragon ke prem main duube hue hai
 He is so fond of the dragon, considered to be the national symbol of China, that he prefers to install the giant dragon figurines first in every ashram

 Pilot Baba is considered to be the most powerful of the Juna Arena in the religious city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges
 aajkal is ashram ko or vishalkay banaaya ja rahaa he
 Please tell that this ashram belongs to the same pilot Baba whose saint speaks in the Samaj and Juna Akhara
 mana jaataa he ki baba akhaadon ke santo main sabase bade dhan-kuber hai or isaki vajag bhi he
 The reason is that not only Baba's country, but also many devotees are spread abroad
 baba ke videshi bhakton main china ke bhakton kii sankhya zyada he
 Pilot Baba's ashrams are full of idols of gods and goddesses
 lekin baba ke ashramon kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki unke ashramon main vishalkay chini dragon bahut pramukhataa ke saath dikhaai dete hai
 Pilot captures Baba so much that he gets statues of this dragon installed in his ashram
 dragon prem kii vajah se hi payalat baba ko kai baar virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa he
 When Pilot Baba was building an ashram in Uttarkashi, a huge dragon was also installed in that ashram, on which the locals objected and created a ruckus there
 logon ke virodh ko dekhte hue hi unhen naa keval ashram se dragon kii murtiyon hatwani padin, balki unhen hameshaa ke liye uttarkashi kaa ashram bhi chhodana pad gaya tha
 But even after this protest, Pilot Baba's dragon love did not diminish
 baba ke har ashram main andar daakhil hone ke pehle aap daravaajon par dragon kii pratimaayein dekh sakate hai
 The dragon is also installed in Pilot Baba's ashram being built in Haridwar
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki baba apane dragon prem ko maanate hai or ve isaki tulana bharat ke rashtriya chinh se bhi karte hai
 If you think Pilot Baba loves Chinese Dragon only then you are wrong
 baba kaa pyaar to china ke liye khub umadta he
 Baba feels that India has no threat from China, not only this, Pilot Baba reads the praises of China as if he is the national spokesperson of China
 sarkaar bhi baba ko hidaayat de rahi he sarkaar ne baba ko kanoon kaa dar bhi dikhaaya he
 In the past, China not only encroached on the Indian border in many places but also had the courage to show a part of Kashmir in its map and the whole of Arunachal in its map, which caused anger among people across the country
 aise main desh kaa ek aisa sant jis par lakhon log bharosa karte hon or wo aise samvedansheel vakt main china kaa bachaav karen to us sant kii deshbhakti par to log andeh karenge hi
 Rahul Dravid missed his sixth double century while Mahendra Singh Dhoni missed his fifth century but the partnership of 193 runs for the sixth wicket between the two gave India a huge lead of 373 runs in the first innings and the third and final Test cricket against New Zealand

 -input bhashaa se Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, in a meeting of Chief Ministers convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requested that at least 50 per cent of the central plan budget be made available to the states in a lump sum so that the state governments can run the schemes according to local needs
 'udaarikaran se badale halaat main jaruri he parivartan'akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki centre ke kul bajet kaa 26 pratishat bhaag plan bajet ke rup main he
 Out of them, the total allocation to the central ministries goes to 85 per cent and only 15 per cent remains as block grant for the states
 isliye vyavastha yah honi chahie ki centre apane paas bajet kaa bada ansh rakhane ke bajaay use rajyon ko de den
 Akhilesh Yadav said in New Delhi on Sunday that not all states normally benefit from the programs run by the Center
 kuch aise kaarykram bhi hai, jinase kuch hi rajya phayda uthaa pate hai, kyonki kaaryakramon main lagaai gai sharton or pratibandhon kii vajah se kathinaayee aati he
 Allocation of financial resources should be done among the states in a transparent manner and in this sharing priority should be given to the needs of backward regions and states
 unhone kaha ki yojanaon ke tahat kam se kam 90 pratishat anudaan raashi rajyon ko uplabdh karai jaae, kyonki centre dwaara sanchalit yojanaon kaa rajyon par bada vittiya bhaar pad rahaa he
 Such programs bring unnecessary pressure on the economic condition of the states and in some cases the state governments find themselves helpless in fulfilling such obligations
 akhilesh ne rajyon ko apni jarurat ke anusaar yojanaayen chalaane karne kii purna swatantraaa die jane par jor dete hue kaha ki panchavarshiya yojanaon ko antim rup dene se pehle rajya sarkaron se vistrut vichaar-vimarsh kiya jaae
 The Chief Minister suggested that the Center and the States should have equal participation in the form of the Planning Commission, so that all-round development of the states could be preserved collectively without any discrimination and the federal structure could be strengthened
 akhilesh ne kaha ki rajyon kii apni-apni praathamiktaayen hai, isliye sabhi rajyon par ek hi niti kargar nahin ho sakati
 Flexibility in policies is necessary so that states can make changes in their economic, social and geographical conditions
 unhone kaha ki yojana ayog ke swaroop par vichaar karne se pehle rajyon ko yadi isaki ruparekha kii prati uplabdh karakar us par raay lee jaati, to zyada phydemand hota

 On 9 July, when Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah met the party's in-charge of the party's superpower center and Shakti Kendra in Chennai, he was told that "opposition parties are ridiculing the party by saying that the BJP in Tamil Nadu Finding does not help
 ''halki si muskaan ke saath shah ne uttar diya, "yadi vipaksh ko tamilnadu main bhaajapa ko dhundhna he to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iviem main dhund le
 There is no doubt that the BJP is going to emerge as a major force in Tamil Nadu in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ''unhone yah bhi elaan kar diya, "agaami loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ham uchit samay par tamilnadu main gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Whichever alliance it will be with, it will ensure that the state is free from corruption and is on the path of development
 ''shah kaa yah bayaan anayas nahin he
 In fact, he has prepared a blueprint for the future plan by taking full details of the last two Lok Sabha and Assembly elections from Tamil Nadu as well as those states where the party's presence is nominal
 aise rajyon main apane chunavi pradarshan ko prabhavi banane ke liye bhaajapa chote-chote dalon (panjikrut lekin gaiyr manyata praapt) ke saath gathjod kii raah talash rahi he
 The process of contacting such parties has also started
 bhaajapa kii yah ranneeti shah ke us lakshya ke lihaaj se bhi makul he jisamen unhone 2019 main bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat 50 fisadi karne kii baat kii he
 In informal conversations, BJP leaders believe that the ruling party or chief ministers of states like Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal are so strong that it is difficult for the party to succeed in these states in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne trikoniya yaa bahukoniya mukaable vaale jin rajyon main shandaar pradarshan kiya tha vahaan bhaajapa virdohi dal lamaband ho rahe hai
 These include the states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Delhi, Haryana and the Northeast
 bhale hi in rajyon ke prabhaavshaalee dal aapas main ek-duusare ke virdohi hai lekin apana astitv bachaane ke liye or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko rokane ke naam par sabhi aapasi matbhed bhulaakar ekajute ho rahe hai
 The brunt of this has been suffered by the BJP in the by-elections held during the last few months
 jin rajyon main bhaajapa kaa sidhaa muqabla congress se he vahaan bhi bhaajapa kii raah 2014 kii tarah aasaan nahin dikh rahi
 For example, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa
 in rajyon main bhaajapa ko bhi sattavirohi rujhaan kaa ehsaas he
 Amit Shah has reiterated this many times, "in states where the party had great success in 2014, some seats may be lost
 is kami kii bharpai ham duusare rajyon se karenge
 In Coromandel State and coastal states, BJP will get good success in 2019
 '' pichley do saal se unhone apni team ko aise 150 siton par kaam karne ke liye lagaaya bhi he, jahaan bhaajapa kii upasthiti nammaatr he
 a senior BJP leader says, "it is true that in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal or Telangana, the party is a force but is not in a position to win the seat alone
 par yah sikke kaa ek pahalu maatr he
 The second aspect of the coin is that the BJP will be able to join small allies in these states to compete with the larger parties there
 '' unka tark he ki tripura main bhaajapa ne aisa hi kiya tha
 By joining the small parties there, the BJP gained majority on its own in the state
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main apana dal or phir 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main om prakaash rajbhar kii party ke saath samjhauta karke badi safalataa hasil kii
 BJP strategists believe that there are more than 70 such small parties in the whole country who may not win the elections on their own, but these parties have between 50 thousand and 10 lakh votes
 ye vot loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se dekhne main bhale kam dikhte hon lekin agar bhaajapa ke saath ye dal judate hai to un rajyon main bhi use badi safalataa hasil ho sakati he, jahaan philhal vah kamjor maani jaati he
 Many of these small parties hold good among the farmers
 kuch dalon kii majdoor sanghathanon main to kuch kii aadhyatmik jagat ke logon main apni pahchaan he
 For example, the Peasant and Workers Party of India is a political party associated with the trade union
 iskaa prabhaav maharashtra ke ramgarh, sholapur, nagpur, nanded, nasik ke alaava andhra pradesh ke kuch hisson main bhi he
 This team also has a good work among the students and its student organization called Purogami Yuva Sangathan is also effective
 yah dal vidhansabha main ek-do seat jitati he, lekin loksabhaa chunaav main badi safalataa hasil nahin kar paati
 According to the BJP strategists, if the votes of these parties are transferred to the BJP, then its candidates can win the seats where the BJP loses by 50 thousand to 1 lakh votes
 misaal ke taur par, tamilnadu main tenkasi main bhaajapa ke sahyogi emdmake ne 1,89,386 vot hasil kiya tha or pitipi ne 2,61,757 vot
 If the votes of both are added then it is 26,557 votes more than the 4,24,586 votes won by the victorious AIADMK
 jaahir he, chote dal kai siton par ahm sabit ho sakate hai
 Shah has made it clear that in 2019 the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will have a bigger clan than the opposition parties
 isliye endie kaa kunba badhaane ke liye anaam odisha party, bahujan mukti party, bahujan vikaas aghadi, bharip bahujan mahasang, gondvanaa ganatantr party, jaibharat samanta party, jai samyak andhra party, loksatta party, manithaneya makkaal kaachi (memke), puthia tamilagam (piti), pyramid party of india, rashtriya samaaj paksh, visike, welfare party af india jaise kai chote-chote dal hai jinhen bhaajapa apane saath jodgaye ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 For this, the Organization Minister of States has been given the responsibility
 har booth par tainaat booth padaadhikariyon ko likhit nirdesh diya gaya he ki ve pichley do loksabhaa or do vidhansabha chunaav ke aankade sanghathan mantri se hasil kar dekhen ki jin boothon par 1,000 se 5,000 voton se party pichad gai thi, us margin ko puraa karne ke liye kis chote dal se talmail karne kii jarurat he
 Why are there small parties Parbhajpa formed an alliance with only a few big parties in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 anya jagahon par chote-chote dal hi endie ke kunbe main shaamil the
 The Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh were with the BJP
 anaupchaarik baatcheet main bhaajapa netaa yah kehete hai ki bade dal par nirbharta adhik rahati he
 It is also more likely to deteriorate
 bhaajapa ke saath yah kai baar ho chukaa he
 For example, the TDP left the BJP recently
 shivasena bhi ghudki de rahi he
 This creates an uncomfortable situation for the BJP
 bhaajapa 2014 se lekar ab tak akele itani majboot ho chuki he ki vah apane dam par bahumat hasil kar chuki he or abhi bhi us sthiti main he
 But smaller parties abound because in the seats where they win and lose by a small margin, the bjp's position will be better by joining with these parties and there will be a possibility of victory
 bihar main pichley chunaav main ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party or upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party, uttar pradesh main apana dal, maharashtra main shetakari sanghathan or ramdaas athavle kii arpiai se gathjod kargar sabati hua
 In such a situation, smaller parties can prove to be better allies for the BJP
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa tamilnadu kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 39 main se bhaajapa yahaan sirf ek seat hi jeet saki thi
 If this time in the state, the BJP makes alliances with smaller parties like PT, VCK of the state and relatively state parties like MDMK or PMK, then both the major parties in the 10 Lok Sabha seats including Theruvallur, Chennai South, Sriperembudur, Kanchipuram, Arakkonam, The DMK and AIADMK can be bumped up
 bhaajapa ke rajyasabha saansad or media vibhaag ke pramukh anil baluni kehete hai, "pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main desh ne pichley chaar saal main prabhavi vikaas kiya he
 Given the work and intentions of the Prime Minister, many parties wish to join the NDA
 itnaa tay he ki 2019 main endie kaa kunba 2014 se bhi bada hoga
 Whether the party is small or big, all have their own importance
 bhaajapa sabhi dalon ko baraabar sakvamaan detii he
 "sadhana is not easy but it is not easy for BJP to take small parties together
" chote dal is baar apni ahmiyat acchhee tarah se samaj rahe hai
 These parties feel that going with the BJP may get one or two seats, but even after winning the elections, the BJP will benefit
 ek yaa do saansadon ko lekar bhaajapa par dabaav banane kii sthiti main nahin rahenge
 Raju Shetty of the Shetkari organization says, "the things the BJP asks for support later retract
 2014 main ham bhaajapa ke saath kisaanon ke hiton ko lekar gaye the lekin sarkaar banane ke baad kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar hamaari baat ko usne nazarandaaj kar diya or hamen bhaajapa se dur janaa padaa
 At the same time, Dr
 K
 K
, the leader of the PT Party of Tamil Nadu
 krishnasami kaa kahana he, "jo bhi dal hamase gathjod kii baat karne aate hai unhen hamaari ahmiyat kaa pataa he
 But our work is not as much as one or two mps, but it is important to know how much importance they give to our ideology
 yadi sirf sansad main pahunchane kii baat hoti to ham apni alag party kyon banaate, ham congress yaa bhaajapa main hi shaamil ho jate
 Similarly, Prakash Ambedkar, the leader of Maharashtra's Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh, has also been strongly critical of the BJP
 andhra pradesh main adhik sakriy pyramid party ke ek padaadhikari kehete hai, "ham acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki kuch badi partiyaan hamaare sahyog se apana hit sadhana chaahati hai, lekin ve yah baat acchhee tarah se samaj len ki ham kya chaahate hai
 Since vegetarianism, performing arts and spirituality are our core ideologies, we can consider the issue of going with whoever talks about them
 ''congress kii bhi najarchhote dalon kii ahmiyat kaa andaja isi baat se jaahir he ki un par sirf bhaajapa nahin, congress kii bhi najar he
 Randeep Surjewala, the head of the Congress's media department, says, "in the kind of environment in the country, whether a big party or a small one, everyone's rights are being oppressed
 yah baat sabhi mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Therefore, the Congress expects cooperation from all those parties which believe in the plurality of this country
 congress ke liye koi bhi party achhut nahin he
 As far as the alliance and seat sharing is concerned, A
 ke
 The Antony Committee is authorized for this
 vahi is vishay main vichaar karegi
 To protect democracy, it is necessary that all parties, big and small come together
 '' congress ke ek netaa kehete hai, "kai chote dal vaicharik rup se congress ke najadik hai
 Be it the MMK of Tamil Nadu or the Kaumi Ekta Dal of the Hindi belt or the National Samaj Paksha of Maharashtra
 ''vahiin surajevaala bhaajapa par kataaksh karte hue kehete hai, "jis tarah bhaajapa ab har rajya main chote-chote dalon ko saadhane kii jugat main he, usase saaf he ki vah yah maanakar chal rahi he ki kisi bhi rajya main koi bhi badi party uske saath jane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Those who were together have left and are ready to leave some
 ''philhal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bade dal ek-duusare ko haraane ke liye jis tarah chote dalon ko saadhane main jute hai, usase chote dalon kii ahmiyat badhegi tathaa kai siton par jeet- haar tay karne main bhi inaki bhoomika ahm ho sakati he
 Obviously, local and small issues may not affect the Lok Sabha elections very much, but in the seats where there will be a contest of thorns, their issues with smaller parties can also play a decisive role
 *** Renowned historian and biographer Ramachandra Guha says that the Congress party going towards 'continuous decline' can be overcome only by 'change in leadership'
 iske saath hi unhone suzav diya ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya janaa chahie
 However, Guha termed the suggestion as his 'fantasy' and said that if JDU president Nitish takes over the Congress party 'in a friendly manner' it will be like a 'couple in paradise'
 apni kitaab 'india after gandhi' kii 10veen varshganth par iske rivizd sanskaran ke vimochan ke maukey par guha ne kaha, 'main aisa isliye kah rahaa hum, kyonki congress bagaiyr netaa vaali party he or nitish bagaiyr party vaale netaa hai
 He said that Nitish is a 'reasonable' leader
 guha ne ek kaarykram main kaha, 'modi kii tarah, un par parivaar kaa koi boj nahin he
 But like Modi, he is not complacent
 vah sampradayik nahin hai or langik muddon par dhyaan dete hai, ye baaten bhartiya netaaon main virale hi dekhi jaati hai
 Nitish has some things that used to appeal and appeal
 ' unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh jab tak nitish ko yah pad nahin saunpatin, tab tak 'bhartiya raajnneeti main unka yaa sonia gandhi kaa koi bhavishya nahin he
 The columnist-writer Guhane said that the 131-year-old Congress can no longer be a major political force and may increase its existing 44 seats in the Lok Sabha to 100 in future
 saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa hawala dete hue guha ne kaha, 'ab agar kal unka koi nayaa netaa yaa netritv ban jaataa he, to chijen badal sakati hai
 Two years is a long time in politics
 ' unhone kaha ki congress kaa patan bhi 'chintajanak' he, kyonki ek party vaali pranali loktantr ke liye 'acchhee cheez' nahin he
 Guha, who has been critical of both the Left and the Right, said, "the rule of a single party made even a big democrat leader like Jawaharlal Nehru egoistic
 isane pehle se hi nirankush rahi indira gandhi ko or nirankush bana diya
 In such a situation, i have started thinking about how this thing will make Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 'guha ne kaha ki bharat pashchimi loktantron ke do party ke sthaayee model ko apnaane main naakaam rahaa he
 He said that the two-party rivalry in the states should not be weakened
 unhone kaha, 'pichley 70 saal main bharat ke jin teen rajyon ne aarthik or saamaajik index ke mutabik acha pradarshan kiya he, unamem tamilnadu, kerala or himachal pradesh shaamil hai
 
 
 And all these have a comparatively two-party permanent system
 'guha ne pashchim bengal (vam morcha) or gujarat (bijepi) kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki jin rajyon main lambey samay tak ek hi party kii sarkaar rahi, vah 'vinaashkari' sabit hua
 He said, "the states that have a permanent two-party system do well, because in Kerala the Congress keeps the Left in check, while the BJP in Himachal keeps the Congress in Himachal
" 'pan macmilan india kii ore se 2007 main prakashit pustak ke rivizd sanskaran main ling, jati or bharat main samalangik andolan ke udai sahit kai anya muddon par nae adhyay shaamil kiye gaye hai

 Metropolitan Magistrate Dheeraj Mittal issued summons on Friday Smriti and directed him to appear in court on September 27
 purv congress saansad nirupam ne 20 disambar, 2012 ko smriti ke khilaaf shikaayat daakhil kar aarope lagaaya tha ki smriti ne tivi par ek charchaa ke dauraan unke khilaaf apmanjanak or abhadra tippanee kii
 During that time the results of the Gujarat assembly elections were announced
 vakil aarake handu ke madhyam se daakhil shikaayat main kaha gaya, 'bijepi kii sansad sadsy aaropee (smriti) ne shikayati (nirupam) ke charitra par sidhaa laanchhan lagaakar unki manahani kii
 'the allegation in the complaint,' the accusatory, abusive and defamatory remarks of the accused during the alleged discussion has affected the credibility of the excellence and loyalty of the complainant (nirupam)
 'isse pehle smriti ne bhi ek samachar channel par hui ukt bahes ko lekar hi kathith taur par apni manahani ke liye nirupam ke khilaaf shikaayat daakhil kii thi or adaalat ne smriti ke liye kathith apmanjanak or abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal karne ke maamle main unke (nirupam) ke khilaaf aarope tay kiye the
 Nirupam had alleged in her complaint that Smriti also deliberately made derogatory remarks against him
 shikaayat ke mutabik, 'aaropee kii abhadra or apmanjanak tippaniyon or aaropon ke kaaran shikayati kii saakh or raajnneetik kariyar ko baari nuksaan hone ke saath unhen maansik pidaa pahunchi he
 Nirupam said that he had sent a legal notice to Smriti through her lawyer on 25 July last year and asked her to seek an unconditional apology but Smriti did not respond
 smriti kii shikaayat par adaalat ne nirupam par ipisi kii dhara 500 (manahani) or 509 (kisi mahila ko apamaanit karne ke iraade se koi shabd bolnaa yaa koi mudra bananaa) ke tahat mukadmaa chalaaya
 If convicted, Section 500 of the IPC provides for two years of simple imprisonment or fine or both
 dhara 509 main ek saal kii saadhaaran kaid yaa jurmaana yaa donon kaa praavdhaan he
 In her complaint, Rajya Sabha member Smriti claimed that Nirupam had allegedly questioned her ability to analyze the election results as an actress
 anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad pioke main teror lonchpad main khoonkhaar aatankiyon kaa jamaavadaelosi se sate simavarti ilaakon main anuchhed 370 hataae jane kaa nahin dikh rahaa asarmodi sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ko hataate hue jammu-kashmir ke vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm kar diya, jiskaa asar dikhne laga he
 At the same time, this move of Modi government has shocked Pakistan and is constantly trying to infiltrate terrorists from across the border
 haalanki bhartiya sena kii chaukasee ke chalate khoonkhaar aatanki ghuspaith karne main naakaam ho rahe hai
 Lt Gen KJS Dhillon, commander of the 15 Corps, Srinagar, said that the terror launch pad in pok has gathered the dreaded terrorists
 anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad se pakistani aatanki rojaanaa raat ko ghuspaith kii koshish kar rahe hai, jisko bhartiya sena lagaataar vifal kar rahi he
 However ceasefire violations at the border remain closed
 dhillan ne kaha ki pakistan kya-kya kar rahaa he, isaki hamako puri jaankaree he
 There will be a befitting reply to every nefarious act of Pakistan on the border
 iske liye bhartiya sena puri tarah se taiyaar he
 Pakistani shelling in areas adjoining the loc is not seen to have any significant effect on the removal of Article 370 in the areas of Junk Kashmir adjacent to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok)
 niyantran rekh (elosi) se sate ilaakon ke logon ko 370 ke hatane yaa na hatane se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 People in the Tangdhar area bordering the Line of Control (loc) are only afraid of the nefarious activities and firing of Pakistan
 simavarti ilaakon main 370 hataane kaa nahin dikhaa asarthangadhaar main suraksha karmiyon kii tainaati bhi zyada nahin dekhne ko mil rahi he
 At the same time, a large number of security forces have been deployed in other parts of Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir ghati ke kuch hisson main chhitput hinsa kii khabaren bhi ai hai
 However, there is an atmosphere of peace in the border areas adjacent to the loc
 pehle kii tarah hi bazaar khulte hai or log khariddaari karte hai
 The Tangdhar area is populated by Gujjars, Bakarwals and Pahari people
 ye log zyaadaatar kashmir ghati se puri tarah se kate rahete hai
 An official said that the stir in the Kashmir Valley has no effect on the areas adjacent to the pok
 tangadhaar ilaake ke sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki un logon kii kashmir se alag pahchaan he
 They have their own local dialect, which is very similar to Punjabi
 yahaan ke logon kii sabase badi samasyaayein pakistan ke golabari kaa khatra, garibi or sardi ke mausam main kashmir ghati se sampark tootna hai
 Here the share of population in politics is also very less
 thandi ke mausam main ghati se cat jate hai simavarti ilakethndi ke mausam main barfbaari ke chalate is ilaake kaa kashmir ghati se sampark tut jaataa he
 This area is extremely backward
 jab ajtak ne tangadhaar main dukaan chalaane vaale mohammad makabool se anuchhed 370 ko lekar baatcheet kii gai, to unhone kaha ki anuchhed 370 ko hataae jane kii unako koi jaankaree nahin he
 He says that Article 370 has no effect on our lives
 hamako sirf pakistan ke golabari se suraksha chahie
 We appeal to the government to build bunkers here and protect us from Pakistani shelling
 simavarti ilaakon ke logon kii maang- bunker banaae sarkaar30 june ko pakistan ne tangadhaar ke ilaake main baari golabari kii thi
 Many buildings were damaged and many people were injured
 haalanki is baar kii golabari main kisi kii maut kii khabar nahin he
 Locals say they had not seen so much shelling for decades before
 iske baad bhartiya sena ne pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya tha, jisamen kai pakistani sainik maare gaye the
 However, people here always have a fear of firing Pakistan
 yahaan ke log lambey samay se sarkaar se bunker banavaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 According to the sources, 3000 bunkers have been approved to be built in the areas adjacent to the loc and work will start soon

 Posted byryoton Wednesday, September 23, 2015 aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state (is)ne iraq ke aitihaasik shahar nimrud ko dhamaake se tabah kar diya he
 In a video released by the IS on Sunday, it can be clearly seen how the terrorists of IS destroyed this historic city by blasting
 IS dwaara jari ye video koun-si taarikh kii he, yah abhi tak saaf nahin ho paaya he
 But it can be seen clearly in this video that the IS located 30 kilometers from Mosul has been leveled by the blasts
 mana ja rahaa he ki IS ne is ghatana ko kareeb ek maheene pehle anjaam diya tha
 However, the damage done to the city has not been reviewed yet
 aapako bataa den ki pichley kuch dinon se IS ke aatankiyon ne iraq ke kai pracheen or aitihaasik shaharon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he

 gujarat main chunaav prachaar khatm ho chukaa he
 After a bitter election battle, by Thursday evening, the voters of Gujarat will seal the fate of both BJP and Congress in evms
 somvaar ko subah 11 baje tak haal ke varshon ke sabase pratikshit vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kii tasviir saaf ho jaaegi
 Rajdeep Sardesai, India Today tv's consulting editor and host of the popular prime-time show News Today, toured the entire state of Gujarat to understand the political beat of the state
 apni gahan chunavi reporting ke aadhaar par ve bataa rahe hai gujarat chunaav kii 10 mukhya baaten:1
 Modi's magic: Narendra Modi's rule rests on the hearts of Gujaratis
 unhone rajya main mukhyamantri ke rup main lagaataar teen chunaav lade or jite hai
 Today he is not fighting for the post of Chief Minister, yet this election is being fought on his charisma
 gujaratiyon se unka jis tarah se judaav he, vaisaa kisi bhi or netaa kaa nahin
 2
 rahul kaa nayaa avatar:kareeb ek dashak se jujh rahe or raajnneeti main anichhaa se kaam karte dikh rahe rahul gandhi ko nayaa rup mil gaya he
 The energy with which he is contesting the Gujarat elections has surprised all his critics
 apane mukhya pratidwandvi jaise bold to vah nahin hai, lekin ek bade vaktaa kii jagah ek achche shrota hone ke apane naram, udaar ravaie se unhone logon ke dil main jagah banaai he
 If he can actually convert his rise into votes, then a strong fight could be seen in 2019
 3
 x Factor: a new leader has emerged in the stronghold of the Patels and he has become a shocking special force of this election
 hardik patel ladaai ko sadakon par le jane vaala ek aisa yoddha ban gaya he, jisane bijepi ke liye ladaai ekatarfa hone ko asambhav bana diya
 The Congress will owe its rise largely to Hardik Patel
 unke andar mamata banerjee jaisaa lagaataar ladane kaa jujharupan, kejariwal jaisaa akkhadpan or bal thakare jaisi tej dhar vaali vakputata he
 According to today, he is a leader of strength and future
 4
 Gujarat Model: The Gujarat model has been questioned
 is chunaav ne gujarat ke vikaas par itani roshni daal di he jitani pehle kabhi nahin thi, is vajah se isaki khamiyaan bhi ujagar ho gai hai
 Yes, Gujarat has done a good job towards building physical infrastructure, but its performance in social and services sector is poor
 shiksha or sehat puri tarah se nijee haathon ko saunp dene kii vajah se modi kaa gujarat model haasyaaspad ban gaya he
 Therefore, in the battle of 'vikas Gando Thayo' versus 'hu Vikas Chhun', the battle of concept has reached a very low level
 5
 Partition game: There is a lot of difference between villages and cities in the state
 shaharon main chamakdaar naeflioveror oonchi imaaraten dikhti hai, to gramin gujarat main kaaphi pichhadaapan he
 It seems that despite the Patel factor, the BJP will win most of the seats in cities, but rural Gujarat is not going to make a concession
 rajya main panchayat vyavastha kaaphi pehle tut chuki he
 Farmers are troubled and unemployed among both educated and illiterate youth in villages
 6
 Economic issues: Gujarati was ready to adopt GST and demonetisation, but only when 'business is not affected
 ' chote or majhole udayamon main gujarati kaarobaari ke liye notebandi or jiesti dohari maar sabit hue hai
 The anger is perhaps even greater because the Gujarati PM government, considered business friendly, is not ready to listen to their grievances
 yah gussa ek gumnaam tip ke siem dwaara chalaai ja rahi sarkaar ke khilaaf ja saktaa he
 7
 musalmaan koi masalaa nahin:miyaan musharraf se lekar mughalon, miyaan ahamed patel or salmaan nijaami tak, shaayad hi kisi rajya main samudaayon ke dhruvikaran kii is tarah se aasaan or vaidhanik koshish hui ho, jaisi ki gujarat main hui
 Despite all this, there is no talk of Muslims having a 10% share in the population of Gujarat
 yahaan tak ki congress ne bhi is baar chunaav main ek baar bhi 2002 kii charchaa nahin kii or rahul gandhi mandir-mandir darshan ke liye jate rahe
 8
 jati kii raajnneeti:gujarat main jati kii raajnneeti ek alag tarah kii he
 Here caste is important but is not going to be distributed on the basis of parties
 patelon kii ekajutata hardik patel ke peeche dikh rahi he, haalanki unka ek varg bijepi ko vot degaa
 The Kolis of Saurashtra can vote separately from the Kolis of South Gujarat, Dalits and Adivasis are also divided and obcs may not run according to Alpesh Thakor
 jis tarah se bijepi ko apane vistaar ke liye hindutv plus kii jarurat padati he, usee tarah se congress ko apane matadaata aadhaar ko badhaane ke liye cast plus raajnneeti kii jarurat he
 9
 koun jitegaa gujarat:sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki gujarat koun jitegaa? lekin yah kaaphi jatil sawaal he
 Gujarat has been a strong fort of BJP for almost two decades
 amit shah ne rajya main booth kaaryakarta se lekar sheersh tak ek majboot sanghathan banaaya he
 Gujarat is the home ground of modi-shah
 congress ne bhi ab is par kaam karnaa shuru kiya he
 The advantage for the Congress is that there is a kind of undercurrent against the government
 to koun jitegaa, is sawaal kaa jawaab 18 se pehle milanaa asambhav he

 BJP leader and minister in UP government Shrikant Sharma said that Rahul Gandhi & Co
 is in the fraternity
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi tregedi tourist hai, jahaan tregedi hoti he, vah jarur jate hai
 The UP government, which is rescuing the culprits, reacted to this matter by Congress leader Randeep Surajwala, who is Mr

 At the same time, Subrata Rai requested the court that he wanted to stay at home, but would follow whatever the court ordered

 It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Rai on February 26 and asked the police to arrest him and appear before him on March 4

 It was for the first time that the top leaders of the party stood at the Samajwadi Party (SP) event in front of the Hindu saints from Ayodhya and Mathura and the sages from Mathura, from whom they still kept a distance
 parashuram jayanti par beeti 12 may ko sapa ke pradesh mukhyalay main yojit bhavy brahman samaaroh ne saaf kar diya ki dalit, musalmaan ke baad ab brahmïna samudaay bhi raajnneetik partiyon kii vot bank kii raajnneeti main nishane par aa gaya he
 At the same time, BSP National General Secretary Satish Chand Mishra, in the eastern district of Maharajganj, 350 km from Lucknow, at a Brahmin conference organized in the grounds of Jawaharlal Nehru PG College, was counting the benefits of joining the BSP to the Pandits
 beete ek maah main sapa kaa apane party karyaalay main yah doosraa brahman sammelan tha to beete 18 april ko lakhanu main brahman bhaichara raily karne ke baad bispi ne soobe kii 36 loksabhaa siton par aisi hi reliyon kaa silsilaa shuru kiya he
 With the bugle of preparations for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, why have parties suddenly started seeing a vote bank among the Brahmins? Senior Congress leader Narayan Dutt Tiwari, who was the four-time chief minister of the state and the last Brahmin chief minister till the 1989 assembly elections, says, "in the past years, the highest Brahmin in the state has been neglected
 ab pehali baar yah varg apane adhikaron ke liye ekajute ho rahaa he
 In this solidarity, the parties see the vote bank
 '' aisa daawa he ki upi main 12 fisadi brahman hai
 According to a state planning institute official, according to a survey conducted in Sultanpur district in 2007, about 40 per cent of the girl students receiving money here were from Brahmin families
 itnaa hi nahin, pichley varsh sapa sarkaar banane ke baad berogari bhatta paane vaale berozegaron main sabase zyada 40 se 45 fisadi brahman hai
 For the last 20 years, Brahmins have been the worst hit in the ever-decreasing jobs in UP
 naukariyon main uchit pratinidhitiv na milane ke kaaran brahman samudaay main rosh he
 There are 20 such seats in the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, in which the Brahmin voters claim to be 20 to 25 percent and here this community is playing a decisive role in the elections
 ye siten hai—shahjahanpur, hardoi, sitapur, lakhanu, unnav, raibareli, amethi, sultanpur, bhadohi, varanasi, mirzapur, faijabad, gonda, basti, devaria, baliya, khalilabad, maharajaganj, kushinagar or gajiabad
 These 20 Lok Sabha seats come from all the backward districts except Lucknow, Varanasi and Ghaziabad
 isse saamaanya rup se ek andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki brahman varg main ekajutata kii ek badi vajah aarthik pichhadaapan bhi he
 Among the parties involved in the preparations for the Lok Sabha elections, the SP started trying to bring the Brahmins into its court
 party ne iskaa jimmaa raibareli kii oonchaahar vidhansabha se vidhayak or samaajawaadee brahman sabha ke adhyaksh dow

 pandeya ne pichley saal november main sapa ke pradesh mukhyalay se brahmïna sammelnon ke ek silsile kaa aagaaj kiya, jo soobe ke aadhe se zyada jilon main hue
 After the murder of CO Ziaul Haq in Kunda in Pratapgarh in March, the SP feared that Thakur voters would pull out of the party after showing MLA and then Food and Civil Supplies Minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya out of the cabinet
 Compensation is done by taking the strategy of associating the Brahmins
 pandeya bataate hai, ''pichley saal pradesh main sarkaar banane ke baad sarkari naukariyon main pramotion main aarakshan ko samaapt karne se bhi sapa brahman matadaataaon ke bich behad lokapriy hui he
 Reservation in promotion is one such issue on which BSP Brahmin is on the backfoot among voters
 '' bispi ke pradesh pravaktaa or vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh swami prasad maury kehete hai, ''pramotion main aarakshan anusuchit jati or janajati ko mila sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 This will not harm the rights of other castes
 lekin vipakshi partiyaan is mudde par kuprachaar kar brahmïna samet sabhi savarna jatiyon ko bhramit kar rahi hai
 "if SP and BSP have jumped into the battle of Brahmin votes, then BJP also sees the possibility of Brahmins joining the BJP again in the atmosphere created by the SP government's policy of Muslim appeasement
" varisht bijepi netaa calraj mishra kehete hai, ''ramajanm bhoomi kaa nirmaan na karvaa paane se brahman matadaata party se dur hua
 Efforts to resolve it by consensus have intensified after the High Court's decision on the issue three years ago
 iske alaava sapa or bispi kii sarkaron ke kushasan se ajiz aakar brahman matadaataaon main bijepi ke sushasan se judye kii lalak paidaa hui he
 "even though the Congress may be slow in the race for election preparations compared to BJP, SP and BSP in the state, the battle to grab the Brahmin votes in UP has now gone from the popular hoarding to rallies
" aagaamee dinon main bijepi or congress jaisi rashtriya partiyaan bhi agar is jang main apane brahman netaaon ke kandhon par bandook rakhkar kud paden to aashcharya nahin hoga
