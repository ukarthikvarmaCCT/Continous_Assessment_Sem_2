 The monsoon session of Parliament has been announced
 rajyasabha ke upasabhapati pije courian kaa kaarykaal bhi 30 june ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 Therefore, political agitation has intensified regarding the election of the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 kaha ja rahaa he ki upasabhapati ummidavaar ke taur par congress trinmul congress ko samarthan dene kaa man bana rahi he
 Congress does not have sufficient strength, the number of Congress members in the 245-member Rajya Sabha is 51
 aise main congress ke paas apana ummidavaar jita paane ke liye paryaapt sankhyabal nahin he
 Therefore, the Congress is trying to support any opposition candidate with which more and more non-bjp parties can be gathered
 ise padhein: monsoon satr : kya sanyukt vipaksh ko haraane ke liye samjhauta karegi modi sarkaar?trinmul congress kaa samarthan kar sakati he congressutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar congress, trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke varisht netaa or rajyasabha sadsy sukhendu shekhar raay ko samarthan dene kaa man bana rahi he
 Working on this strategy, the Congress has opened the way for talks with its arch rivals TMC and BJD in West Bengal and Odisha

 On the other hand, Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP Derek o'brien appeared to be avoiding this question, in a statement on Wednesday, Derek has said that the name of the deputy candidate for the Deputy Speaker has not been decided yet
 hamane kisi kaa naam nahin liya he

 usne sapane dekhe ki ek din vah un sab logon kii tarah amir ho jayega jo uske gaanv se bahut pehle yahaan aakar bas gaye the
 But then time conspires against him
 use prem ho jaataa he ek ladki se
 Which she was seen only once in a wedding
 teen saal tak us ladki ko prem patr likhata he or phir ek galatfahami main uski bahan ke saath bhagkar shaadi kar letaa he
 He confesses to his 'mistaken' wife and his family
 uski jindagi ke varsh bitate jate hai
 During this time he does many jobs which do not take him anywhere
 lekin har shaam, naakaami ke bhav se virakt vah istambul kii sadakon par bhatakta he, boja bechata he or apane dimag kii 'strengeness' par hairaan hota he
 Due to this thrill, he is able to feel different from others

 You might not know that Lata Mangeshkar and her sister Asha Bhosle had to sing the song 'A Mere Watan Ke Logo' by poet Pradeep, who brought tears to the eyes of the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 lekin ek nayi pustak main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he ki geet ko sangitabaddh karne vaale si
 Lata did not have a good rapport with Ramachandra and she only voiced the song on the condition that she would record it solo
 raju bharatan ne apni nayi pustak ‘e jarney down melody len’ main likhaa he, ‘si
 Ramachandra first thought of 'aye Mere Watan ki People' according to Duet
 
 Till then Lata & c
 ramchandra ke bich sharton main baatcheet nahin thi
 The poet Pradeep reconciled them
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah sanyog hua jab lata anpekshit tareeke se subah chah baje pradeep ke viley parley sthit awaas par ‘i mere vatan ke logo’ gane kii ichha jataane pahunch gayin bashart unhen yah gaanaa akele gane diya jaae
 According to Bharatan, Asha had also collaborated with the composer for the song but Asha retreated when Lata insisted on recording it alone
 is geet ne china se 1962 ke yuddh ke baad desh main samvednaa kii ek lahar paidaa kar di thi or nehru is geet se itnaa prabhavit hue ki unhone lata ko gale laga liya
 Regarding the two sisters, Bharatan said that OP Nayyar was the only music composer who stayed away from Lata at that time while other musicians wanted to vocalize their songs to Lata's voice
 pustak kahati he ki naiyar ne na keval lata kaa virodh kiya balki pratidwandvi ke taur par aashaa ko taiyaar kiya or donon ne nau saal tak saath main kaam kiya
 The confrontation between OP Nayyar and Lata began when the famous singer protested against Nayyar in 1954 when he replaced his favorite director in the film 'mehbooba'
 opi or aashaa kii jodi ne ‘ye he reshmi julfon kaa andhera’, ‘jaaie aap kahaan jaaenge’ or ‘ishaaron ishaaron main dil lene waalon’ jaise geet diye lekin baad main alag ho gayi
 Later, Asha worked in RD Burman's musical direction to create a different identity and later married him

 california main pakistani mul ke apane america pati ke saath golibari karne vaali pakistani mahila ne fasebuk par post daalkar islamic state aatankwaadi sanghathan ke netaa abu bakr al-bagdadi ke prati vafadari jataai thi or is hamale se pehle duusare hamalavar-apane pati ko kattarpanth kaa paath padhaayaa tha
 14 people lost their lives in this attack
 is ghatana kii jaanch se jude tirmerica adhikariyonne sienen se kaha ki jab saan banardino hamalaa chal rahaa tha tab 27 varshiya hamalavar tashaphin malik ne fasebuk par aies netaa ke prati apni vafadari kaa zikr karte hue post kiya
 An American official said that Malik had commented on Facebook from an account created under a different name
 adhikariyon ne yah nahin bataaya ki unhen kaise pataa chalaa ki malik ne hi post kiya tha
 It is the woman who drew her husband to fundamentalism! a law enforcement official said that it appears that the inspiration for Wednesday's attack may have been taken from the Islamic State
 lekin kisi bhi adhikari ne yah nahin bataaya ki aies ne isahamale kaa nirdeshdia tha
 The attack killed 14 people and injured 21 others
 baad main hamalavar malik or uske pati 28 varshiya saiyad rigwan faruk police muthbhed main maare gaye
 One official said, 'it looks like reading a text of fundamentalism by itself
 ’ ek anya adhikari ne bataaya ki anya ne is kattarpanthi drushtikon ke liye asar daalaa ho 
 Investigators are also looking at whether this firing occurred due to any religion related issue at the workplace
 pehle jaanchakartaaon ne kaha tha ki shaayad malik ne apane pati ko kattarpanth kii ghunt pilaayi
 The two had hatched another attack
 Law enforcement sources said that there was a strong possibility that Malik might have taught radicalism lessons for Farooq and he had planted pipe bombs at various crime spots
 jaanchakartaaon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki in donon ne saamaajik seva centre main golibari kii is ghatana ke baad ek or hamale kii sajeesh rachi thi
 But their second attack did not lead to the killing of the two in a police encounter
 donon kii chah maah kii ek beti bhi he
 There was not much known about Malik's previous background before he came in contact with Farooq, who had met in Saudi Arabia
 lekin ek america adhikari ne kaha ki faruk ke sitambar, 2013 mensaudi arbajaane ke baad donon mili or phir donon kii sagaai ho gayi
 Malik, a Pakistani national, applied for a K-1 visa at the US Embassy in Islamabad in May 2014 and Farooq traveled to Saudi Arabia in July that year to bring him to the US
 donon kii 16 agast, 2014 ko shaadi hui
 According to Fox News, investigators believe that during these visits to Saudi Arabia, both came in contact with one or two suspected Al Qaeda terrorists
 lekin us sampark kii prakruti tatkaal spasht nahin hui he
 - input language ek danga peedit ne adaalat main congressi netaa sajjan kumaar ko saal 1984 narsanhaar ke dauraan sikhon kii hatya ke liye bheed ko uksaane waalon main se ek ke rup main pahchaanane kaa daawa kiya he
 These riots took place after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 abhiyojan ke gavaah ke rup main gavaahi dete hue shila cor ne adaalat se kaha ki usne sajjan kumaar ko bheed se yah kehete hue dekha ki sikhon ne ‘hamaari maa’ ko maaraa he or unhonebheed ko unki hatyakarne ke liye uksaaya
 Sheila testified before District Judge Kamlesh Kumar, saying, "I don't remember the time on November 1, 1984, i heard a voice outside my house
" main ghar se baahar ai or dekha ki mere ghar ke saamne park main bheed ikattha thi
 i saw the accused Sajjan Kumar telling the crowd that the Sikhs had killed our mother
 bheed ne narebaaji shuru kar di
 'they said,' Keep on killing the accused Sajjan Kumar, burn their houses
 main apane ghar kii ore bhaagi
 The crowd came towards my house with sticks
 
 He told the court that the mob had taken out and murdered three of her family members husband Balbir Singh, father-in-law Basant Singh and brother-in-law Balihar Singh
 sajjan kumaar, brahmanand gupta or veda prakaash pashchimi dilli ke sultanpuri main surajeet singh kii hatya ke maamle main hatya tathaa danga karne ke aarope menmukademeka saamana kar rahe hai
 In hotels and restaurants, you must have seen most men as chefs
 desh or duniya ke kai namchin hotalon main purush hi head shef hai
 Despite this, even today, the work of cooking food is considered to be exclusively for women only
 aapane kitne gharon main purushon ko kichan main khadey hokar lunch yaa dinar taiyaar karte dekha he? haalanki aisa nahin he ki khaanaa banane main patni kii madad karne vaale purushon kii sankhya naganya he lekin ye bhi sach he ki aise purushon kii sankhya behad kam he
 While this is a bitter truth, there is also a truth that almost every wife wants her husband to cook for her only occasionally
 par kya aap jaanate hai, shaadishuda mahilaayein aisa kyon chaahati hai?1
 Who does not want his partner to love him, to feel affection and love
 kisi din aapkaa kaam karne kaa man na ho or aapke pati khud hi aapse ye kahen ki aaj wo kooking karenge to nishchit rup se aap special mahasoos karengi
 This effort of the partner will give you comfort and will also make them feel loved
 iske saath hi rosemara kii jindagi main ek badlaav bhi aayega
 Women feel that their partner is sensitive to them
 2
 The second major reason behind the expectation of women to spend time together is that they like to spend time with their partners
 kooking main acha-khaasaa samay lagata he
 In most of the households, the wives cook in the kitchen and the husband is busy with his work
 par jab pati khaanaa bana rahaa ho to patniyaan unke saath hi khadi rahati hai or madad karti hai
 These light-hearted moments spent together strengthen the relationship
 3
 The state of equilibrium in the house also cannot be super human
 jo ghar or baahar kaa puraa kaam sanbhale or uske baad thake bhi nahin
 In such a situation, it would be better not to put the responsibility of a house on the shoulders of the wife only and only, the husband and wife should divide it in half
 kichan main pati dwaara kii gai thodi bahut madad bhi patni ko raahat dene ke liye bahut he
 This will also tackle the work quickly and there will not be any burden on any one
 4
 a child's home is also his first school for children
 jahaan wo rosemara kii chijen dekhakar, sunakar sikhta he
 When the child sees that both his parents are doing household chores equally, he also has respect for domestic chores
 varanaa zyaadaatar maamalon main yahi dekha gaya he ki bachche ghar ke kaam ko kamatar samajhate hai or maanate hai ki baahar jaakar paisa kamanaa hi sabakuch he
 This thinking is wrong and parents can explain it to the child only through their own efforts
 5
 a new color comes in life
 The same routine every day can be boring for anyone
 aise main agar kabhi-kabhaar pati khaanaa banaae to routine main ek nayaapan aayega
 Not only the wife but also the husband can enjoy it as a creative work

 hyderabad main mahila doctor ke saath hui haivaaniyat se deshbhar ke log kaaphi gusse main hai
 Many fake news related to this are also going viral on social media
 isi tarah soshal media par ek video viral ho rahaa he, jisamen dekha ja saktaa he ki ek jalati chita ke chaaron ore baari sankhya main log khadey hai
 The video is claimed to be of the funeral of a female doctor who was the victim of rape and heinous murder in Hyderabad
 clic kar dekhen videois post kaarkivd varjanayahaan ( dekha ja saktaa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the claim made in the video is completely false
 iskaa hyderabad main balaatkaar or nirmam hatya kii shikaar hui mahila doctor ke antim sanskaar se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Actually, this video is of Bachhadau of Barmer district in Rajasthan, where a final farewell is being given to the Indian soldier Piraram Thori who died on the border
 fasebuk par ek public group 'naveen Pattnaik Fan Club' main fasebuk yujar 'pyari Ka Dairy Babu' ne yah video post kiya he, jisamen ek jalati chita ko ghere hue kaaphi log dikh rahe hai
 This video has been shared more than 800 times till the news is written
 is video ko hamane jab invid Tool kii madad se reverse search kiya to ‘upi fite times’ naam kii website par shahid piraaram kii khabar mili
 Through this lead, when we looked at videos related to Shaheed Peeram on youtube, we saw many videos of similar location, which were posted on youtube by many people
 khabar ko or pukhta karne ke liye hamane google ke jariye vahaan kii ek sthaneey dukaan ‘shriram fishan shop’ ke maalik bajrang choudhary se sampark kiya or watsape ke jariye video unako bheja
 Bajrang Chaudhary also confirmed that this video is of the funeral of martyr Piraram
 bhartiya jawan piraaram jammu-kashmir kii 15 hajaar feet oonchi barfili chotii par duty ke dauraan himaskhalan kii chapet main aakar pichley maheene hi shahid ho gaye the
 Several local channels have also aired news related to this
 hamane hyderabad kii doctor ke antim sanskaar kaa video bhi net par search kiya or ETV Andhra Pradesh ke utyub channel par hamen vah video mil gaya
 It is said that his body was cremated in Hyderabad itself
 is dauraan unke parivaar ke log bhi video main dekhe ja sakate hai
 It is thus clear that the video that is going viral has nothing to do with the doctor who was victim of humanity in Hyderabad
 yah video rajasthan ke barmer kaa he jahaan shahid piraaram kaa antim sanskaar kiya gaya tha

 Suppose today you know that the stent that was put in your heart four years ago was not necessary and the ninety thousand you gave for that stent was thirty thousand, so what would you do

 jo aapako hindu- muslim ke naam par ladaata he uski taraf hi zyaada dhyaan hota he Virender Sangwan, a lawyer by profession, filed a petition in the Delhi High Court in 2014 that the cost of stents in hospitals was going to be much higher
 sangwan ne maang kii ki stant ko National List of Essential Medicines (NELM) main daalaa jaae
 When Sangwan came to know that Rs 1 lakh 26 thousand was taken for a stent in a hospital in Faridabad and the price was not written on his box, then he came to know that the government does not regulate the price of the stent, so the hospital or the dealer arbitrary Is charged isi dauraan pataa chalaa ki company se oparation teble tak pahunchate-pahunchate stant kii keemton main 1000 se 2000 guna kii badhottaree ho jaati he
 Sangwan won his case and the Delhi High Court also ordered the central government, but the government continued to lax
 july, 2016 main avmaananaa yachika daayar kii gai ki sarkaar court ke aadesh ke anusaar kaam nahin kar rahi he
 The government took the decision after filing another petition in December 2016
 iske tahat ab sarkaar ne saare aspataalon ke liye stant kii keemten tay kar deen
 Millions of patients can benefit from this decision if the hospital does not take out other ways of earning due to fixing the price of the stent so that the patients have to pay as much money as before
 abhi se sunai dene laga he ki stant kii keemat fiks karne ke baad se aspataalon ne angeoplasty kaa package manhagaa karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Another heroine of this story is Doctor Meera Siva of All India Drug Action Network
 inhone bhi isaki ladaai ladi he
 You know that there are many types of stents
 drug alutting stant or biorezorbeble stant kii keemat 30,000 kar di gai he
 Only the price of metal stent has been fixed at Rs 7,500
 pehle drug alutting stant kii keemat 24,000 se 1
 There used to be 5 lakhs
 biorezorbeble stant kii keemat ek lakh sattar hazaar se lekar do lakh nabbe hazaar hua karti thi
 Now both will meet for 30,000
 acha faisla to he hi, isse bahuton ko raahat milane vaali he
 During this report, while doing research on the internet, it was found that in the year of 2016, 6 lakh stents were used in hospitals of India
 ab sochiye 30,000 kaa stant aapane dedh paune do lakh main lagavaaya
 Hospitals have earned a lot through stents
 kai jagah yah bhi padhane ko mila ki bharat se lekar america tak main 25-30 pratishat logon ko stant lagaaya gaya jabaki wo sirf dawa se thik ho sakate the
 According to the order that has been made now, the hospitals will separately tell in their bill how much the cost of the stent has been recovered
 is faisle kii tarif ke saath ek sawaal uth rahaa he agar us par kuch nahin kiya gaya to is tarif kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 Meaning, the hospital will charge you thirty thousand stents, but will increase the price of other things
 tab aap kya karenge
 The matter is arising that in the situation in America, the whole process of what to do is decided
 vahaan bhi bina zarurat ke stant lagaakar aspataalon main baari munafa kamaaya he
 Therefore, the process of operation and installation of stents should be fixed and then the regulator should be made to monitor this process, which will come from outside and audit the hospitals
 2009 main america main dil ke doctoron ne stant lagane kii ek guideline banaai thi
 After that the effect was good
 766 aspataalon main 27 lakh stant prakriya kaa adhyayan karne par paaya gaya ki vahaan ab bejaruri stant lagane kam ho gaye
 Earlier 25 percent of the unnecessary stents were seen, then now 13 percent are being found
 giravat ai he
 One thing is arising that the Clinical Establishment Act will be required
 ye kya he, isse kya ho jayega ham baat karenge
 Rema Nagarajan of Times of India has done a lot of reporting on these things
 unki puraani report se pataa chalata he ki dilli kaa jibi pant aspataal stant lagane kii factory ban gaya tha
 There were 1000 stents a month
 14 march, 2015 kii rema nagarajan kii report kahati he ki zyaadaatar marizon se doctoron ne kaha ki aspataal se stant kii jagah privet dukaanon se stant kharid kar laaen
 The rate of stent in government hospitals is Rs 23,625
 privet sapliron ne marizon se 23,625 kii jagah 68,000 or 42,000 rupee main stant bechaa
 As of August 2014, the hospital had 12,000 stents
 inamen se 7,200 stant aspataal ke baahar baari keemat dekar khride gaye the
 Later, when there was an uproar, Astpal stopped bringing stents from outside
 tippaniyan Those who do not know much about the stent, it is important to briefly explain what the stent is
 ye ek tarah kaa chota challa hota he, kisi choti spring yaa baloon jaisaa jise dil kii dhamniyon main us jagah feet kiya jaataa he jahaan cholestrol jamane kii vajah se khun kaa pravaah band yaa phir bahut kam ho gaya he
 This procedure is called angioplasty
 sharir main ek patali tub jise catheter kehete hai uske zarie ise pair or haathon kii badi dhamniyon ke raste dil tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 During this entire conversation you should also be aware of an important government department
 ye he NPPA yani National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority
 The job of this institute is to control the prices of medicines in the country
 dawaaon kii kami par nigaah rakhana or use thik karnaa bhi iske kaam ke daayre main aata he
 The NPPA also advises the government on medicines-related policies and prices
 pichley hi saal may ke maheene main NPPA ne 81 dawaaon kii qimaton kii ceiling tay kar di thi
 These included medicines for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, bacterial infections
 peshey se vakil virendra sangwan ne 2014 main dilli hoicourt main ek yachika daayar kii ki aspataalon main stant kii keemat bahut zyaada vasuuli ja rahi he
 Sangwan demanded that the stent be inserted into the National List of Essential Medicines (NELM)
 sangwan ko jab pataa chalaa ki faridabad ke ek aspataal main stant ke liye 1 lakh 26 hazaar rupee liye gaye or uske bakse par keemat bhi nahin likhi thi tab inhen pataa chalaa ki sarkaar stant kii keemton ko regulate nahin karti he, isliye aspataal yaa dealer manamaane daam vasuulate hai
 At the same time, it was found that by reaching the operation table from the company, the price of the stent increases by 1000 to 2000 times
 sangwan apana cese jeet gaye or dilli hoicourt ne centre sarkaar ko aadesh bhi de diya, magar sarkaar dhilaai baratati rahi
 a contempt petition was filed in July 2016 that the government was not acting as per the court order
 disbanr 2016 main ek or yachika daayar karne ke baad sarkaar ne faisla liya
 Under this, the government has now fixed the stent prices for all hospitals
 is faisle se lakhon marizon ko phayda ho saktaa he basharte aspataal stant kii keemat fiks karne ke kaaran apni kamai ke duusare raste na nikaal len jisase marizon ko pehle jitna hi paisa dena pade
 It is now heard that since fixing the price of stent, hospitals have started to make the package of angioplasty expensive
 is kahani kii ek or nayika hai ol india drug ection network kii doctor mira shiva
 They too have fought it
 aap jaanate hai ki stant kai tarah ke hote hai
 The price of drug eluting stents and bioresorbable stents has been increased to 30,000
 sirf metal stant kii keemat 7,500 rupee fiks kar di gai he
 The first drug eluting stent costs 24,000 to 1
 5 lakh tak hua karti thi
 The price of bioresorbable stents ranged from one lakh seventy thousand to two hundred ninety thousand
 ab donon hi 30,000 main milenge
 It is a good decision, it will provide relief to many
 is report ke dauraan internet par research karte hue jaankaree mili ki 2016 ke saal main bharat ke aspataalon main 6 lakh stant kaa istemaal hua
 Now think that you got 30,000 stents installed in one and a quarter to two and a half lakhs
 aspataalon ne stant ke zariye kaaphi kamaaya he
 It was also read at many places that 25-30 percent of people from India to America were put on stents, whereas they could only be cured with medicine
 ab jo aadesh hua he, uske anusaar aspataal apane bill main alag se bataayenge ki stant kii kitni keemat vasuuli gai he
 a question is being raised with praise for this decision, if nothing is done on it, then this compliment will have no meaning
 matlab aspataal aapse stant ke tees hazaar hi lenge magar baaki chizon ke daam badha denge
 What will you do then
 baat ye uth rahi he ki america main kis sthiti main kya karnaa he, isaki puri prakriya tay he
 There too, he has made huge profits in hospitals by installing stents without need
 isliye oparation or stant lagane kii prakriya tay ho or phir is prakriya kii nigaraanee ke liye regulator bane jo baahar se aakar aspataalon kaa audit kare
 In 2009, heart doctors in the US created a guideline to install stents
 iske baad asar acha hua
 After studying 27 lakh stent procedures in 766 hospitals, it was found that there are less number of bezturi stents
 pehle 25 pratishat phaltu stant lag rahe the to ab 13 pratishat lag rahe hai
 Has declined
 ek baat uth rahi he ki clinical establishment act kii zarurat hogi
 What is this, what will happen with this, we will talk
 times aaf india kii rema nagarajan ne in baton par khub reporting kii he
 His old report shows that GB Pant Hospital in Delhi had become a factory to install stents
 maheene main vahaan 1000 stant lagate the
 Rema Nagarajan's report of March 14, 2015, states that doctors asked most patients to buy stents from private shops instead of stents from the hospital
 sarkari aspataalon main stant kaa rate 23,625 rupee he
 Private suppliers sold stents from patients for Rs 68,000 and Rs 42,000 instead of 23,625
 2014 ke agast tak is aspataal main 12,000 stant lage the
 Of these, 7,200 stents were purchased outside the hospital at a heavy price
 baad main jab hangaamaa hua to astpal ne baahar se stant laane par roak laga di
 The comments jin logon ko stant ke bare main zyaada jaankaree nahin he unhen sankshep main bataanaa zaruri he ki stant hota kya he
 It is a kind of small ring, like a small spring or balloon which is fitted in the arteries of the heart where the blood flow has stopped or is reduced due to cholesterol freezing
 is prakriya ko angeoplasty kaha jaataa he
 a thin tube in the body called a catheter is delivered to the heart through the large arteries of the feet and hands
 is puri baatcheet ke dauraan ek mahatvapurn sarkari mahakme kii jaankaree bhi aapako honi chahie
 This is NPPA i
e
 National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority
 is santhaan kaa kaam desh main dawaaon kii qimaton par kaabo rakhana he
 Monitoring and correcting the shortage of medicines also comes under its purview
 NPPA dawaaon se judi nitiyon or qimaton par sarkaar ko salaah bhi detaa he
 In the month of May last year, the NPPA fixed the ceiling of 81 medicines
 inamen cancer, diabetes, hisertension, epilepsy, bacterial infections jaisi bimariyon kii dawaaen shaamil thim
 Millions of patients can benefit from this decision if the hospital does not take out other ways of earning due to fixing the price of the stent so that the patients have to pay as much money as before

 Too bad if the pitches you played on got a ‘good’ rating— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash)december 21, 2018 In the national capital Delhi, the miscreants have become so fearless that they are also attacking the policemen
 buudhvaar raat ek badmaash ambedkar nagar ilaake main ek rahgeer se lutpaat kar rahaa tha, tabhi dilli police ke sipaahi sohan laal uski madad karne pahunche gaye
 The crook attacked the soldier Sohan Lal instead of running away from there
 is hamale main ghayal sohan laal ko fouran ames le jaaya gaya, jahaan unka ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Police said the miscreant who attacked constable Sohan Lal was arrested on Wednesday night
 uskaa naam jubair he, jo ambedkar nagar main rahata he
 Several cases of looting and snatching are already registered against Zubair
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki buudhvaar raat ambedkar nagar ilaake main sadak ke kinare jubair kathith taur par ek rahgeer se lutpaat kar rahaa tha
 In the darkness of the night, that passerby was screaming 'bachao-bachao' in panic
 jubair ke haath main chaaku tha, jisaki vajah se rahgeer buree tarah se daraa hua tha
 The screamer of that passerby fell in the ears of the policeman Sohan Lal, who was passing by that time
 haalanki yah sohan laal kaa ilaaka nahin tha
 Sohan Lal is posted at Sarai police station and during the night he went to Ambedkar Nagar police station for some work
 jab wo waapas apane thane ja rahe the, tab unako rahgeer kii cheekhney kii aawaaj sunai di
 Sohan Lal was in uniform
 lihaaja unhone turant apni bike sadak ke kinare roki or us rahgeer kii madad karne ke liye maukey par pahunch gaye
 Sohan Lal thought that the crook would be scared and run away after seeing the policeman, but that crook did not scare him seeing him in uniform, but he attacked Sohan Lal
 usnedilli polisake sipaahi sohan laal ke kaan or chehre par chaaku se kai waar kiye
 During this, people ran towards the scene after hearing the noise, and then the crook ran away from the spot
 iske baad hamale mengayal sipahisohan laal ko turant ames le jaaya gaya, jahaan unka ilaaj chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, the rogue, who attacked Sohan Lal, has been arrested by the police

 370 ke khatme ke baad jis tarah se pakistan lagaataar bharat ke khilaaf agenda chalaa rahaa he us par altaaf hossain ne naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 The impunity of the MQM leader has always hit Pakistan

 Since then, he has remained politically in Pakistan from London

 muslim paksh ne limitesan kii avadhi khatm hone se chaar din pehle daakhil kiya tha
 Justice Chandrachud said that after 23 December 1949 there was no Namaz there, but the worship continued? On this, Dhawan said that if for some reason the namaz could not be performed in the mosque, it does not mean that the existence of the mosque ended
 ram janmabhumi nyaas kaa gathan isliye kiya gaya taaki masjid ko giraaya ja sake
 Rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu side had no proof that Lord Rama was born in the inner enclosure
 is baat ke bhi koi saboot nahin kii aantarik ahaate main puja hoti thi
 Rajeev Dhawan said that the opinion of Justice Khan and Justice Sharma in the judgment of Allahabad High Court was different
 justise khan ne kaha tha ki masjid banane ke liye kisi strecchar ko dhwast nahin kiya gaya tha, jabaki justise sharma kii raay isse alag thi
 Dhawan said that Jilani had rightly said that no documents before 1885 should be accepted
 1885 se pehle ke jo dastavej hindu paksh ke paas he wo sirf videshi yatriyon kii kitaab or skanda puraana or duusari kitabe hai
 Rajiv Dhawan said that even though the mosque has been demolished, the mosque is always a mosque
 ayodhya main dhwast yaa giraayi gai imaarat aaj bhi masjid he
 Rajiv Dhawan said that Aurangzeb was an extremely liberal king
 mohammad gori sahit duusare log jinhone bharat main yuddh kiya, kya unhone masjidon kaa nirmaan kiya? - ek nai tarah kaa itihaas likhane kii koshish na ki jaae

 02

 or aakhri baar 16 disambar, 1949 ko namaaz hui
 On this Rajiv Dhawan said that whether to worship or not does not establish the right on the land
 masjid to masjid hi rahegi, hamane muslim scolers se bhi baat kii he
 On this, Justice Bobde said that Zafaryab Jilani was giving interviews yesterday

 He said that under the Bench Molding of Relief, if one party gives an option to the other by giving ownership, then the claim of Muslim parties is made
 unhone kaha ki teen pahalu tital ke sawaal par bantwaaraa hi galat tha, islamic kanoon or quran bahut pechida he
 Hindu parties cannot reject our wafed mosque on the basis of one side of it, the other is about the limit and the third is the possession
 ise padhein: ayodhya: SC se bole muslim paksh ke vakil- aap mujhase sawaal karte hai, hindu paksh se nahin!12
 14 PM: On behalf of the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan said that i will not talk about any diary, reverence or faith

 1885 se 1989 tak hindu paksh kii ore se jameen par koi daawa nahin kiya gaya
 11

 Rajiv Dhawan said that the claim of offering flowers to the devotees of Ram Janmabhoomi under the dome has not been proved, there were people by trespassing
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki jab vahaan par puja chal rahi thi, to ghusane kaa kya tha
 He said that never broke the temple and built a mosque, there has been frequent prayers

 Rajiv Dhawan said that when it was decided for four days on Friday, i could not answer the argument of the Hindu side
 ab main puri raftaar se apni daleelein rakhuunga, facts bataa die gaye hai or ab sirf kanoon kii baat rakhuunga
 Section 144 is applicable in Ayodhya, the administration is fully ready before the final hearing commencing on Monday
 ayodhya jile main 10 disambar tak ke liye dhara 144 laga di gai he, chappe-chappe par surakshabal mustaid hai
 So that if the decision has some effect then it can be handled
 haalanki, dhara 144 ke is faisle se ayodhya main diwali ke maukey par hone vaale deepotsav par koi asar nahin hoga
 Hearing to be completed in four days? According to the deadline set by the Supreme Court, now there is a total of four days for the hearing

 'the team needs such a bowler

 Apart from this, the strength of the team also has to be seen
 jaise ki yadi ham do spinneron ke saath utarate hai to unamem se ek acha ballebaaj hona chahie
 We do not have a fast bowler all-rounder who can score four overs in T20 and ten overs in a 50-over match and also bat well
 isliye hamen in sab chizon ko dimag main rakhana hota he
 The captain did not reveal whether he would come up the batting order or not
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen team kaa sangyojan dekhnaa hoga ki koun kis pojishan par khel saktaa he

 In the midst of political drama, the BJP leaders also held meetings in the BJP twice a day
 Today, the BJP Core Committee convened again, whose government will be formed in Maharashtra, this is the question for which everyone is waiting for the answer
 magar ye sawaal raajnneeti kii kai paraton main ab bhi dabaa hua he
 The Shiv Sena has broken up to a 30-year-old alliance with the BJP in the hope of supporting the Congress and the NCP, despite it not being able to stake claim to form the government as the congress-ncp has not taken a final decision on support
 yani sarkaar par suspence ab bhi barkaraar he or is puure siyaasi drame ke bich bijepi bhi kisi taiyaari main juty najar aa rahi he
 After the assembly election results on 24 October, Monday was the most interesting and dramatic day in Maharashtra's politics
 shivasena ke paas shaam 7 baje tak rajyapal ke saamne sarkaar kaa daawa pesh karne kaa mauka tha, jiske liye congress or ensipi kaa samarthan jaruri tha
 So, the Congress and NCP kept meeting all day, but no solution was found and finally the Governor offered the Shiv Sena the third largest party NCP to form the government, saying your time is over
 bijepi kor cameti kii do baithkethjod ke is puure siyaasi drame ke bich sabase zyada siten jeetne vaali bijepi bhi active najar ai
 The BJP Core Committee held two meetings within a few hours at Devendra Fadnavis' residence in Mumbai
 is meeting ke baad bijepi netaa sudhir mungantiwar ne bataaya ki ham puri sthiti ko dekh rahe hai or jo bhi ghatnakram ho rahe hai un par hamaari paini najar he
 Sudhir Mungantiwar told that we have decided to play the role of 'weight and watch'
 bijepi ab kis baat kaa intjaar kar rahi he, yah behad ahm he
 Because the situation that is arising in the state is not clear yet that a new government should be formed under the leadership of Shiv Sena
 aise main agar shivasena ko congress or ensipi kaa samarthan nahin mil paata he to phir ek baar bijepi kii bhoomika ahm ho jaaegi or satta kii chaabi phir se uske haathon main aa sakati he
 Therefore, BJP is not only keeping a close watch on the khichdi that is brewing between Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, but also remains active

 CASAC has made several recommendations since 2004 to continuously streamline procedures and improve infrastructure at airports where passengers' safety is compromised to an alarming extent
 ” maujuuda airodrome code kii samiksha, ranve ke chor par suraksha ilaaka (aaraiese), vimaanon ko uplabdh ranve kii vaastavik lambaai or yantron kii sahaayta se landing kii sambhaavna par vichaar hua
 It was asked to immediately stop the operation of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft up to Jammu and Patna and flight of wide bodied Boeing 747 and 777 aircraft to Calicut
 sieesaisi ne ladakh ke nikat siachin ke paas 10,046 foot oonchai par bane duniya ke sabase oonche sainya airbase thoij tak naagarik udaan le jane par bhi aitraaj kiya
 Thoise only has a 3,000-meter asphalt airstrip and does not have facilities such as marking, air tower control or runway lights
 ranganathan ne kaha ki thoij jaise oonchai vaali hawaii pattiyon par landing ke liye apatkaaleen 'go ground’ prakriya kii sthapana ke bina hi udaanon kii ijaajat de di gai
 Dangerous landing permanent obstructions made the Patna runway 400 meters shorter than the length recorded in the paper
 It has been known for decades that Patna airport is not safe for landing of jets
 17 june, 2000 ko elliance air kii vimaan durghatana main 60 logon ke maare jane ke baad jab ek hawaii vishleshan kiya gaya to donon ranve, 07 or 25 par udaanon ke raste main 100 se zyada avrodh paae gaye
 There were also temporary obstructions such as electric poles, clock tower and trees
 in avarodhon se na keval vimaanon ke liye uplabdh ranve kii lambaai kam ho jaati he, balki isse ielas ke signlon main bhi baadha pahunchati he, jinase ve bekaar ho jate hai
 On November 9, 2010, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ruled that the actual length of the Patna airstrip is 1,556 meters, while the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (CGCA) claim its length to be 1,954 meters
 
 is tarah yah airbas e320-200 vimaan kii landing kii 2,480 meter kii jarurat se 924 meter chota or bowing 737-800 kii landing ke liye jaruri 2,090 meter se 534 meter chota he
 Advising the DGCA to redefine Patna Airport to declare it 4C aerodrome to 3C, the ICAO said it is only suitable for landing small turboprop aircraft
 ranganathan kaa kahana tha, ''garmiyon main agar oonche taapmaana or samudr kii sataha se oonchai ke aadhaar par gananaa kii jaae to patna hawaondde kii ghoshit lambaai or kam ho sakati he or yah jet vimaanon ke sanchaalan ke liye baari khatre vaala sabit ho saktaa he
 In reply to India Today's e-mail on 16 November, DGCA Arun Mishra claimed, "85% of the barriers (trees) have been removed or reduced by AAI
 or is vajah se yah ranve jet vimaanon ke utarane ke liye feet ho gaya he
 "but he did not accept the permanent hurdles and insisted that Patna's ILS was not threatened by secondary signals coming through such barriers
" zyaadaatar payalat aapako yahi bataaenge ki patna main bowing yaa airbas kii landing ek 'du:swapn’ jaisaa hi he
 "the need to come down fast after crossing the trees often makes the aircraft unstable dangerously and is forced to land immediately," said a pilot
 ”sieesaisi kaa maananaa he ki hawaii suraksha kii gambhir chintaaon par aksar raajnneeti or kaarobaari chintaaen haaavee ho jaati hai
 a NOTAM (notice to Airmen) issued (DG0516 / 12) by DGCA in case of Patna's Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Airport asked AAI to stop Boeing and Airbus flights there from 16 August
 lekin bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke nagar vimaanan mantri ajit singh ko patr likhe jane ke baad ise waapas le liya gaya
 Nitish, in his letter dated 6 August, requesting the postponement of the ban, said, "it appears from the reports published in local newspapers that AAI has imposed amended (reduced) distance from August 16, 2012
 Has decided
 isse patna se vimaanon ke sanchaalan main kaaphi kami aa jaaegi or har kisi ko baari asuvidha hogi
 Ranganathan and his team say that Patna is waiting for a major disaster
 dijisie or rajya sarkaron ke daawey ke vipareet unka kahana he ki hawaondde par avarodhon kii sankhya main or badhotaree hi hui he
 He emphasized that the jets should not be allowed to fly from there on any occasion as the runway is short and "every aircraft landing" has the possibility of becoming a coffin
 ” yah chetavanee uddyan mantralay or rajya sarkaar ke liye kaaphi honi chahie
 But it doesn't look like anyone is listening
 galati ke liye koi gunjaaish nahinjammu jaise sainya airbase par naagarik udaanon ke liye suvidhaon kaa abhaav havimanan kshetra par nigaraanee rakhane vaali sanstha ne jammu se jet vimaanon kii udaan par bhi isi tarah kaa pratibandh lagane kii maang kii he
 It is basically a military airbase and the length of the runway is 2,054 meters
 kisi bhi chor par na to aaraiese he or na hi anivaary 60 meter kii pattee
 The safety of this airport is at stake as there is no side strip on either side of the runway and the place where the ILS Localizer for Runway 36 is placed is not in accordance with ICAO rules and AAI manual
 ise ek eent kii diwaar or contile taron se alag kiya gaya he or ek vyast aam sadak ke paas he
 "the signals emanating from the ILS deviate from the surrounding construction and the aircraft arriving at the airport are confused by this," explains a senior pilot of Indigo Airlines
 ”ant kii 60 meter kii pattee or 90 meter ke aaraiese ke baad sanshodhit karne par is hawaondde ke ranve kii lambaai sirf 1,700 meter rah jaati he
 Apart from short runways, the heavy presence of birds in Jammu is another problem
 iske alaava payalton ne jammu airfield ke upar kai baar ''apratyaashit drone gatividhi (bina chaalak vaale chote vimaan) kii bhi shikaayatein kii hai
 Apart from this, the flight around there can also be limited because neighboring Pakistan cannot tolerate violation of its airspace
 ”in asal samasyaon ko jaanane ke baavjood mishra jammu hawaondde par koi roak lagaae jane ke icchhuk nahin dikhaai dete
 He emphasized that the problem of not having additional area required for security will be solved soon as AAI is going to get forest land
 tab tak payalat or yatriyon ko har din maut se bachane ke liye bhagwaan se prarthana kerani hogi kyonki jammu ke liye jet vimaanon kii udaanen berokatoke jari hai
 Dangerous Slippery Kalkatak Major problem in landing a thick rubber coating at the airport
 On July 9, 2012, the Air India Express Boeing 737-800 slipped rapidly while landing in Calicut during heavy rains and also broke several runway lights
 haalanki, yatriyon ko koi chot nahin lagi, lekin isane suraksha sambandhi kai gambhir sawaal khadey kar die
 The story of the plane crash in Mangalore in 2010 was expected to be repeated here
 agast, 2011 main clin air scientific adwijuri kamity (kasaakh) ke sadsy arun raav kii jaanch se maaloom hua ki kalikat kaa airfield bowing 747 or 777 or airbas e 330 jaise vishaal aakaar ke vimaanon ke liye sahi nahin he
 These aircraft are using that airport facility only because the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has licensed it for 4E code aircraft
 uske baad 2012 main ranganathan ke karaae gaesurve main suzav diya gaya ki pahari kshetra ke bich based is hawaondde ko ek shrenee neeche 4si main daal diya jaae or agal-bagal 150 me or donon siron par 240 me kaa ranve or sefti aria diya jaae—donon hi antarrashtriya suraksha bafer hai
 Ranganathan says, "after launching it, there will be no problem in flying a heavy aircraft like the 747
 unhone aage kaha ki khastahal tarkol kaa ranve jisamen tiron kaa bada kabad ikattha ho gaya he, us par barish or vimaanon ke udaanon se faili dhul se jameen par phislan bhar jaati he or isaki gharshan kshamta kam ho jaati he
 The possibility of the aircraft overtaking at high speeds increases
 ” dilachasp baat he ki india today ke sawaal par dijisie najar churaate dikhe
 Mishra argues, "B-747 and 777 aircraft have been flying from Calicut for quite some time
 ” unke jawaab par america sthit hawaii suraksha ke sheersh visheshjna ne naam na chhapane kii shart par pratikriya di, ''lagaataar kiye ja rahe asurakshit vyavhaar ko surakshit kaa naam nahin diya ja saktaa

 khatre ko nyauta de rahe hawaonddemangalore main ab bhi agnishamak kshamtaaon or bachaav ke paryaapt saadhan moujdu nahinzyaadaatar yatriyon ko pataa bhi nahin ki 2010 jaisi vimaan durghatana 25 june, 2011 ko phir ghatane vaali thi
 Air India's Express Boeing 737-800 almost went off the runway
 salbhar pehle haadase kaa shikaar bane jahaaj kii tarah captain ne throtal (ingine main bhaap ke pravaah ko rokane vaala valve) khol diya taaki vimaan ko surakshit rokane main safalataa mili
 At the same time, the co-pilot, wisely reversing the aircraft, stopped the aircraft on the right side of the runway
 2012 main hi 14 agast ko air india kaa doosraa express ranve par utarane kii bajaae ise teji se choota hua aage nikal gaya or waapas duusari baar main hi utarane main kaamyaab hua
 The aircraft was damaged, but fortunately the passengers were safe
 hairat kii baat he ki vimaan durghatana ke do saal baad bhi na mantralay, na hi dijisie yaa eei ne samaadhaan kii disha main koi kadam uthaae
 Frustrated Ranganathan told former Aviation Secretary and Kasak President Nasim Zaidi on May 20, 2012, "the DGCA did not follow any of our suggestions
" ”mangalore main ab bhi agnishamak kshamtaaon or bachaav ke paryaapt saadhan maujuud nahin hai
 Currently, there are four Rosenbauer crash tenders and one Tatra vehicle that keep the airport safe from fire
 lekin patali sadak se judi vah pahari dhalaan ab bhi suraksha suvidha se vanchit he
 Ranganathan says that the densely populated areas near the airport in Mangalore form a barrier to rescue and firefighters
 yahi vajah he ki kasaakh ne resa ke liye kam-se-kam 240 me kaa sujhav diya he
 This means that the runway will be shortened and airlines will face burden restrictions
 ''eei ne july, 2010 main kasaakh ke saath hui baithak main iske liye patibaddhta jataai thi
 But nothing happened
 rajnatik or vanijyik sarokaar unase zyada ahm ban gaye hai
 66-year-old Girish Kaushik, retired president of the National Aviators Guild and a former senior pilot of Jet Airways, is not surprised by the dgca's attitude of ignoring the reality of the airport
 ve kehete hai, ''aisa lagata he ki ye niamak (dijisie, eei) airline prabandhanon ke hiton kii seva ke liye bane hai
 Truth will open their own incompetence so they try their best not to give information to the public or knowingly give false information
 ” unka anubhav bhi alag nahin
 "the DGCA complaint has been kept for so many days," the pilot recalled recalling a large number of complaint letters written in connection with Mumbai's Category 3 Instrumental Landing System (ILS) going waste every rain
 Suppresses that people give up the case after losing
 ” ielas lagane kaa koi phayda nahin agar yah barish ke mausam ke dauraan dhundhale aasmaan main udaan bharne main madad karne ke liye uplabdh na ho
 An experienced Air India pilot says that "if our rules and ICAO guidelines are implemented, 90 percent of India's airports will be closed
" hamaara kaam yah dekhnaa he ki vimaan ne kitni dur udaan bhari, suraksha ke bare main faisla netaa or manager karte hai
 Referring to the recently launched Airbus A-330 flights from Srinagar to Saudi Arabia for the Haj, "it may be politically correct for Jammu and Delhi, but towards Air India and DGCA" This was a dangerous and irresponsible decision
 ” ranganathan kaa kahana he ki dohari niti par chal rahaa dijisie ankhen mundakar baitha he or vimaanon main durghatnaon ke kaaran aae hue nuksaan ko 'chook’ kahkar yaa nazarandaaj karte hue saaf batch nikalnaa chahta he
 However, Mishra disagrees
 niamak ne aisi kai chook ko isieo kii website par durghatnaon kii fehrist main daalaa he
 (see box)
 hawaii suraksha visheshgyon ne chetavanee di he ki baar-baar is tarah kii ghatnaon kaa hona, karrwai karne main dijisie kii laaparvaahee bhartiya vimaanan kii antarrashtriya reating par asar daal sakati he
 The US Federal Aviation Administration was about to put India from category one to lower class two, which would have resulted in Indian aircraft paying higher insurance premiums, as well as prohibiting the expansion of international flights
 shrenee do un deshon par lagu hoti he jo aksar isieo maanakon kaa ulanghan karte hai
 It is clear that among the middle class Hindus who travel regularly by plane, the worrying concern is not only the rising ticket prices but also safe air travel

 com / fbnrynhm0o chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri dow
 Raman Singh arrives at the village of Jashpur, whose sons have sacrificed their lives in the Sukma attack
 naksali hamale main shahid jawan swargeey banmali yadav ke grih gram dhaurasand, jila-jashpur pahunche mukhyamantri raman singh ne shahid kii patni ko assistant sab inspector (asi)banaaye jane kii suchana di
 He expressed his condolences by meeting Jiteshwari Yadav, wife of martyr Jawan Banamali Yadav and family members in the Naxalite attack in Burkapal
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki rajya shashan dwaara shahid banmali yadav kii dharmapatni ko vishesh prakaran ke tahat chhattisgarh police main sahaayak up nireekshak ke pad par anukanpa niyukti di jaaegi
 The state government announced a financial assistance of Rs 28 lakh to the family of martyr Banmali Yadav
 shahid banmali ke parivaar ko kheti ke liye sinchai suvidha pradaan karne ke liye saura sujala yojana ke antargat solar pump kii sweekruti di gai he
 Bore mining has been done on April 29 as per the need and demand of the martyr family
 mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgarguarantee yojana ke tahat shahid swargeey banmali ram ke parivaar hetu kuen ke marammat evam bhoomi sudhaar ke liye 2 lakh 68 hajaar rupee sweekrut kiye gaye hai
 To help the martyr family, the officers of Jashpur district administration voluntarily collected Rs 3 lakh 50 thousand from the amount of their salary and deposited the fixed deposit in the name of Kumari Khushboo, daughter of Shaheed Banmali Yadav, to the State Bank of Jashpur Main Branch

 jate-jatemukhyamantri raman sinhane maukey par maujuud shahid ke parijanon or graminon se kaha ki sukama hamale main shahid javaanon kii shahdat vyarth nahin jaaegi
 Naxalites will get a befitting reply to this, just you wait
 sho main huma kuraishi ke alaava actor vivek obray or diarector omang kumaar bhi jaj kii bhoomika main hai
 After arriving on the set, all the judges start to vibe like children
 aakhir karen bhi kyon na, bacchon ke saath rahane ke liye unke jaisaa bananaa padataa he
 Recently something happened on the set that everyone was surprised
 box offis par sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavat or pedman ke bich ab bhidnt nahin hogi
 In fact, the producers of both films have found a way to avoid such a confrontation with mutual consent
 pedman ke nirmaataa farvari main apni film relies karne ko taiyaar hai
 Akshay Kumar himself informed this in the presence of Sanjay Leela Bhansali at a press conference in Mumbai
 pehle charchaa thi ki akshay usee date par film relies karne ko ade hai
 Let us know why Padman's date released on January 25 has gone ahead
 
 
 
 # 1) Splitting of screens Actually, both films were harmed by Padmavat and Akshay Kumar's film Padman
 baari bharkam bajet (kareeb 180 karod) main bani padmavat ek bhavy film he
 After the release announcement, Padmavat was expected to be ahead of the screen sharing in theaters
 film kaa vishay, starcast or usko lekar bane maahaul main aisa sochna swaabhaavik bhi he
 In the opinion of trade experts, if both films were released, then Padmavat would have got 65 percent of the screens of theaters
 padmavat se nahin takaraayegi pedman, ab 9 farvari ko relies hogi akshay kii film # 2) film kii starcast or bhansaali signecharpadmavat kii starcast bhi ek badi vajah he
 This is a bit further than Padman
 film main deepika padukon, shahid kapur or ranvir singh jaise sitare hai
 Barring Shahid Kapoor, the trio has a very good track record at the box office
 inaki jodi raasalila or bajirao-mastaani ke saath box offis par jaadu dikhaa chuki he
 On the other hand, Bhansali Signature's films have made a tremendous impact on the audience
 haalanki box offis par pichley do saal ke dauraan akshay kumaar kaa bhi trek record bahut behtareen he
 But Padman does not have the same fan appeal of stars other than Akshay as the stars of Padmavat
 supreme faislah kisi rajya main bain nahin hogi padmavat, sarkarein sanbhaalein kanoon vyavastha # 3) padmavat ek family film he
 Actually, this film full of action, emotion, drama and historical fiction has many spices of entertainment
 is baar chaar din kaa lanbaa-chaudaa weekend he
 Would have liked to see Padmavat in the audience
 darasal, pedman kii kahani ek shaks ke sainitory napkin banane kii dhun par aadhaarit he
 The story of Padman may be based on a social subject, but for most middle-class Indian society, it is still a big deal to argue with the family on sanitary pads or watch a film
 trade export kii raay main bhi is ek vajah se padmavat ke saath klesh hone kaa pedman ko nuksaan pahunchataa
 Even before he became the Chief Minister of UP, Akhilesh Yadav had made it clear that hooliganism will not work this time
 party netaaon ko saaf hidaayat bhi di thi
 But the Bahubali leaders of SP are listening to this news of Akhilesh and removing it from that ear and that is why the hooliganism of SP leaders continues in UP
 aisa lagata he jaise samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar naa banakar gundon kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 There is a flood of hooliganism even before the Samajwadi Party formed the government
 muradabad main vidhayak ke samarthakon kii dabangai
 Openly misbehaved with policemen
 consteble ko ronda, daaroga ke saath hathapayee
 This condition of a hospitalized constable is from the vehicle of Samajwadi Party MLA
 aarope he ki espi vidhayak ashutosh maurya apane samarthakon ke saath gadiyon se muradabad aa rahe the to unki gaadi ne bike savaar consteble ko takkar maar di
 The police officer who reached the spot and the rest of the constable also attacked the mla's supporters
 philhal police ne accident kaa maamla darj kar liya he
 There was also hooliganism of SP supporters in Pratapgarh
 or ye aarope laga he mulaayam singh yadav ke kareebi raja bhaiya ke samarthakon par
 Raja Bhaiya's supporters beat the BSP candidate's servant badly
 aspataal main bhartee amit kii is haalat ke jimmedaar bhi espi samarthit vidhayak raja bhaiya ke samarthak hai
 Amit, the driver of BSP candidate Archana Tiwari, alleged that when he was at a barber shop, Raja Bhaiya's supporters beat him badly
 police ne report darj karke jaanch shuru kar di he
 But the question is that when this is the condition of hooliganism before the formation of the SP government, then what can happen after the formation of the government can be estimated
 uttar pradesh ke nae mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne akhilesh sarkaar kii sari yojanaon se samaajawaadee naam hataane kaa aadesh diya he
 Now the word 'chief Minister' will be written in its place
 misaal ke liye 'samaajawaadee ambulance seva' ab 'mukhyamantri ambulance seva' ho jayega
 The Samajwadi Party has opposed this
 uskaa kahana he ki 'samaajawaadee' shabd kaa raajnneeti se sambandh nahin he
 This is in the preamble of the constitution of the country
 isliye is par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 The Yogi government has imposed a lot of restrictions after coming to power
 unheen main ek roak samaajawaadee naam par he, jiskaa istemaal akhilesh sarkaar kii tamaam yojanaon main kiya gaya tha
 Siddharth Nath Singh, Minister and Spokesperson of UP Government, told about Yogi's decision
 unhone kaha ki, upi sarkaar kii jo bhi yojanaayen hai uske tahat jahaan 'samaajawaadee' naam laga he vahaan se wo hatega or uske aage 'mukhyamantri yojana' kehete hue chalegaa
 In the Akhilesh government, the word socialist was attached to the name of most of the schemes
 yahaan tak ki ambulance bhi samaajawaadee naam se chalati thi
 Since the money was received from the Center for this, the Central Government also objected to writing socialist words on the ambulance
 akhilesh kii tamaam yojanaon main samaajawaadee naam tha
 Such as Samajwadi Ambulance Service, Samajwadi Smartphone Scheme, Samajwadi Pension Scheme, Samajwadi Health Insurance Scheme, Samajwadi Salt Distribution Scheme, Samajwadi Kisan Bima Yojana, Samajwadi Yuva Swarozgar Yojana, Samajwadi Handloom Weaver Pension Scheme, Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana, Samajwadi Housing Scheme and Samajwadi e- Rickshaw Scheme, etc
 tippaniyan Though socialism has never had any relation with perfumes, but on 15 March 2016, Akhilesh Yadav launched a perfume named 'samajwadi Sugandha' on the completion of 4 years of his government
 tab akhilesh ne kaha tha, 'maine ek baar kah diya ki nadiyaan samaajawaadee hai kyonki swaabhaavik he ki har dharm-jati ke log uske aas-paas rahete hai
 i have called Lapto a socialist because it eliminates discrimination and when the internet is installed, it works to bring all kinds of information on a platform
 yah samaajawaadee sugandh bhi har tarah kaa bhedbhaav khatm kar degi
 " desh main alag-alag partiyon kii sarkarein apni vichaardhaara ke mahapurushon ke naam se sarkari yojanaon ke naam rakhti rahi hai
 For example, the Congress government ran various schemes like Indira Awaas Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme, Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana
 maujuuda modi sarkaar main bhi “deen dayaal upaadhyaay gram jyoti yojana, deen dayaal upaadhyaay gramin kaushal yojana, deen dayaal upaadhyaay shramev jayate kaarykram, deen dayaal upaadhyaay unnat krishi shiksha yojana jaisi tamaam yojanaayen chalaayin
 But the Samajwadi Party objected to the removal of the term Samajwadi
 yogi sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad bahut sari roak lagaai he
 Among them, a ban is in the name of socialist, which was used in all the schemes of Akhilesh government
 upi sarkaar ke mantri or pravaktaa siddharth nath singh ne yogi ke is faisale ke bare main bataaya
 He said that under the schemes of the UP government, under the name 'samajwadi', he will move from there and will go ahead saying 'chief Minister's plan'
 akhilesh sarkaar main zyaadaatar yojanon ke naam ke aage samaajawaadee shabd judaa tha
 Even ambulances used to run under the name Samajwadi
 chunki iske liye centre se paisa mila tha isliye centre sarkaar ne bhi tab ambulance par samaajawaadee lafz likhane par aitraaj kiya tha
 Akhilesh had a socialist name in all his schemes
 jaise samaajawaadee ambulance seva, samaajawaadee smartphone yojana, samaajawaadee pension yojana, samaajawaadee swasthya beemaa yojana, samaajawaadee namak vitaran yojana, samaajawaadee kisaan beemaa yojana, samaajawaadee yuva swaarongaar yojana, samaajawaadee hathkargha bunakar pension yojana, samaajawaadee rojgaar yojana, samaajawaadee awaas yojana or samaajawaadee i-rickshaw yojana vagairah
 The comments yun to samaajwaad kaa parfyum se kabhi koi rishta nahin rahaa he lekin 15 march 2016 ko akhilesh yadav ne apni sarkaar ke 4 saal puure hone par 'samaajawaadee sugandh' naam se ek parfyum launch kar diya tha
 Then Akhilesh had said, 'I once said that the rivers are socialist because it is natural that people of every religion and caste live around it
 maine lapto kah diya samaajawaadee he kyonki vah bhedbhaav khatm karata he or jab internet lag jaae to har tarah kii information ko ek plateform par laane kaa kaam karata he
 This socialist fragrance will also end all forms of discrimination
 ” Governments of different parties in the country have kept the names of government schemes in the name of great men of their ideology
 misaal ke liye congress sarkaar ne indira awaas yojana, rajeev gandhi gramin vidyutikaran yojana, jawahar rojgaar yojana, nehru rojgaar yojana jaisi tamaam yojanaayen chalaayin
 In the current Modi government too, many schemes like “deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gramin Kaushal Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate Program, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Advanced Agricultural Education Scheme were launched
 lekin samaajawaadee shabd hataane par samaajawaadee party ne etraz kiya he

 Your next film 'action Jackson' is coming, how excited are you about this film? Right now, i asked someone about Action Jackson when you launch anything, you speak a lot, then it shows how much i i am excited, and the second thing is that Prabhu Deva does not speak (laughs), so i have to speak
 aap indinon dadhi ke luk main hai, yah khaas luk kya kisi film ke liye he?main apni khud kii production kii film 'shivaay' ke liye ek luk rakhane kii koshish kar rahaa hum, isliye apane luks ke saath experiment kar rahaa hum or abhi bas koshish he ki koun sa acha rahegaa, to bas vahi rakhuunga
 What kind of film is Shivaay going to be? It will be too soon to tell about 'shivaay', i will definitely tell you next month
 'acshan jackson' ke liye ghar or baahar waalon kaa kya rispons mila he aapako abhi tak?ghar or baahar donon kii ore se acha rispance mil rahaa he
 The first trailer of the film was well liked by the people, and the song worm was also liked by the people
 abhi haal hi main 'gangster baby' gane kaa riection ek hi din main bahut acha or sakaaratmak aayaa he
 How do you keep yourself fit in terms of action? i don't know, i think it happens on its own, but i workout and try to keep myself fit as much as i can

 How does it feel today to remember the stunts of 'phool Aur Kaante' film keeping the two legs on different bikes? Now it seems that i would be able to do the stunt to spread that leg or not, but if someone challenges me If you do, i will definitely do it in a month

 Critics and editors almost say as accusations that so much fame by writing so little! How many such apna is achieved among the readers
 or shivamurti se kabhi kisi ne is babat jaananaa chaha to unhone jawaab diya, “mujhe to kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki main lekhak hi nahin hum

 "this simplicity and simplicity in life and literature is Shivamurti's strength
" 11 march, 1950 ko sultanpur (uttar pradesh) ke kurang gaanv main janme shivamurti janmajaat kissago hai
 The first story was written at the age of 13
 gaanv javaar ke unke baalasakhaa bataate hai ki kisi ghatana ko shivamurti is andaaj main sunaate the ki sab kuch jaise saamne aa khadaa hua ho
 His early life was very rugged
 pita bachapan main hi ghar kaa bhaar inke kandhon par daal sanyasi kii tarah svachhand ho gaye the
 Shivamurthy is responsible for everything related to agriculture, education, relationships, money
 mela bazaar main majamaa lagaakar takat kii goliyaan tak bechin
 The struggle of life wrought him
 dalit, stri or kisaan chetana ke bejod rachanaakaar hai shivamurti
 His step-by-step life was drenched in the clutches of upper casteism
 jati ke aadhaar par duriae, latiyaaye jate logon kii pidaa unhone bhogi
 Shivamurthy's Dalit, woman, that conversation takes shape from the unique experiences of life
 inhen anubhavon se ve katha rachanaaen nikaleen jinhone apni sthai chhap chodi
 His stories are Kasai Bada, Akaldand, Siri Upma Jog, Bharata Natyam, Tiriya Charittar, Keshar Kasturi and Khwaja o Mere Pir
 or upanyaas hai trishul, tarpan or aakhri chalaang
 Shivamurthy's compositions are character-oriented
 yahi kaaran he ki unke paatr hamaari smriti main tike rahete hai
 Tiriya Charittar had created a stir in the Hindi world
 vimali par uske sasur kii kudrushti
 After misconduct blamed Vimali itself and the panchayat decided that instead of planting Tikuli, it would be fired with hot spikes
 or phir chann
 
 
 As soon as it touches the stiletto skin, the cry of the Pahtu tear apart
 upanyaas rachana main bhi shivamurti kaa hastkshep ullekhneey he
 The Trishul, created by keeping communalism at the center, explains the changing Dalit reality and the last leap to tell the truths of Tarapan and farmers committing suicide
 kehete hai ki rachana main sab kuch ho, magar saahas na ho to rachana nistej ho jaati he
 Pierre of Tarpan can avoid going to jail in the ongoing feud with the upper castes, but he mocks his lawyer by saying, "I have to go to jail
" jail kii roti khaakar praayshchit karnaa he
 The atonement of this sin that by pressing the tail of the ear, the people had been persecuting them for so many days
 ”shivamurti ko vyakti or lekhak banane main bahut sari striyon kaa haath he
 Balsakha Shivakumari and Jeevan Sangini Sarita also have a special hand in these
 naach-gaakar pet paalatin bedica jati kii sivakumari ne sangharshon main pisate shivamurti ko kadam-kadam par madad kii
 Sarita kept her mindful of studies
 shivamurti ne kabhi yah nahin sochaa ki ab amuk vimarsh fishan main he to ek frenchiji main bhi le luun
 Her losses interfere long before the duly initiated female discourse
 fabricated dalit vimarsh se alag tarpan jaisi rachana kisi ko bhi vicharottejit kar detii he
 The truth is that his achievement is the readers' trust in Shivamurthy, who understands the common man's happiness and misery as "activist storytelling" and takes it out on the pages

 What should we do when we are not getting our rights? ' Pushpa and his fellow villagers deny that he was under any kind of pressure to convert

 When Maina was asked how he would get his rights by changing religion, his answer was that he would fight and take his right
 donon hi mahilaon ne dharm parivartan ke peeche bhim army kaa haath hone se bhi inkaar kiya
 Not only the identity, but also the name Dalit's Dalits have not only left Hinduism but have also changed their surname

 They are also among those who convert
 unka kahana tha, 'hamane marji se dharm parivartan kiya he

 'on the lines of Manoj, the rest of the youth of the village are also hurt by the atrocities on Dalits

 If Dalit youth of Eghri, Roopdi and Kaparpur are to be believed, the police do not allow them to meet and they are being forced to leave the village forcibly

 ' isi gaanv ke roshan ke mutabik, 'jab hamaare bacchon par julm ho rahaa he to ham kya karenge? hindu dharm main hamen kahin baithne kii jagah nahin milti, ham par atyaachaar hota he
 Due to this, we have adopted Buddhism

 Very serious charges have been made against Dalit youth
 sthaneey daliton kaa maananaa he ki dalit naujavaanon ko jhuthe keson main fansaaya ja rahaa he
 However the local police administration is denying this
 itnaa hi nahin, daliton ke khilaaf hinsa ke liye jimmedaar logon kii shinaakht hone ke baavjood unpar koi karrwai nahin hui he
 Realizing the seriousness of the police's stand, Saharanpur DIG JK Shahi has summoned a report from the Local Intelligence Unit on conversion

 In fact, on Tuesday, Nitin Gadkari was answering questions in Lok Sabha regarding the demands of the funds of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 isi dauraan unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki toll jindagi bhar band nahin ho saktaa
 Less can be more
 gadakari ne aage kaha ki toll kaa janmdata main hum
 If you want good services, then you have to pay the price because the government does not have enough funds
 nitin gadakari ne iske saath hi kaha ki modi sarkaar main sadak, pot parivahan or jal sansaadhan ke kshetron main 17 lakh karod rupee kii pariyojnaon ko award kiya gaya, lekin ek rupee kaa bhrashtachar nahin hua
 Gadkari said, "I want to assure the House that the priority set by the Prime Minister for the development of infrastructure has yielded very good results
" ’’ gadakari ke mutabik rajmarg or bhawan nirmaan kshetra main pragati doguni ho chuki he
 This is a huge progress

 In Gujarat's electoral battle, on the one hand, the main opposition Congress is sidelining its traditional Muslim vote and moving towards soft Hindutva, on the other hand Muslim leaders are getting attracted towards BJP
 ab jabaki chunavi taarikh kii ghoshnaa ho chuki he, aise main tikat paane ko lekar donon dalon main baari rassakashi machi hui he
 Talking of BJP, in addition to its own leaders, Muslim leaders are also claiming to fight on BJP ticket
 khabaren ye bhi aa rahi hai bijepi kaa tikat paane ko muslimon main hode machi hui he
 Especially in the seats where the Muslim vote is in a decisive role, the Muslim leaders are trying to hit the ground on a BJP ticket
 nikaay chunaav main pratinidhitiv badhane se jaagi aasgujrat main mukhya rup se congress or bijepi ke bich muqabla hota he
 After 1995, the Congress has not reached the power of the state
 vahiin duusari taraf bijepi kaa graph lagaataar badha he
 This is the reason that in the 2010 local body elections, BJP fielded Muslim candidates on their ticket and they performed better
 jiske baad musalamaanon main vidhansabha ke tikat milane kii ummid jaagi, haalanki, 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unhen jhatka laga or ek bhi tikat kisi muslim ummidavaar ko nahin mila
 After this, in the 2015 civic elections also, the Muslims got their tickets by getting tickets from BJP
 kareeb 350 ummidavaaron ne bijepi ke tikat par chunaav jite
 This is the reason why Muslims seem to be desperate to get a ticket from BJP in the upcoming December elections
 mana ye bhi ja rahaa he ki bijepi muslimon ko tikat na dene kii rasm tod sakati he
 Muslim candidates can be given tickets from the seats where Muslim votes are in a decisive role
 in siton par daavedarimedia reports ke mutabik, jamalpur, vejalpur, vagara, vaankaner, bhuj or abdasa se muslim netaa tikat milane kii ummid kar rahe hai
 It is also being told that Imran Khedawala, the current independent councilor of Jamalpur, can beat the Congress against the Jamalpur seat by wearing saffron
 is seat par musalamaanon kii sankhya lagbhag 60 fisadi se zyada he
 However, old-time Usman Ghanchi from BJP is also contesting from this seat
 sirf ek baar bijepi ne utaara muslim ummidavaar1980 ke baad bijepi ke itihaas sirf ek baar aisa mauka aayaa he, jab usne gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main kisi muslim ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 In the 1998 assembly elections, the party gave a ticket to a Muslim who could not win the election
