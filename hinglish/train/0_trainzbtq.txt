 bijepi ne aarope lagaaya ki is tarah ke phone kol dilli ke baaki votaron ke paas bhi kiye ja rahe hai or unhen bargalaaya ja rahaa he
 The BJP demanded the Election Commission to take cognizance of the violation by the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal on the issue
 kejariwal-vijendra gupta main hui thi twitor warhal main voter list se naam gaayab hone vaale is mudde par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta ke bich twitor par jamkar ghamaasan hua tha
 Kejriwal alleged that 24 lakh names disappeared from the voter list in Delhi
 is par bijepi netaa or rohinee se vidhayak vijendra gupta ne tark diya ki pichley 10 saalon main 30 lakh nae vot bane hai
 Challenging this argument of Vijender Gupta, Arvind Kejriwal wrote in his tweet, 'your Election Commission has given us a list of 24 lakh people who have been cut within 4 years
 is baar bijepi kaa ganda khel pehle hi khul gaya he
 Therefore you are dazed
 'aam aadmi party lambey samay se is mudde ko uthaa rahi he

 India: 3100+ Overseas: 650+ Worldwide total: 3750+ screens # DDPD The story of Ajay Devgn (ajay Devgn) film 'de De Pyaar De (de De Pyaar De)' is about 50-year-old Ajay Devgan who is separated from his wife
 ajay devgan ko 26 saal kii rakul preet se ishk ho jaataa he
 This unique love story flows throughout the boom
 ajay devgan apni is yuva saathi ke saath apni purv patni or bacchon ke paas pahunchataa he
 a strange story begins after that
 pehla half kuch hansaata he lekin duusare half main aisa lagata he ki diarector ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jo raita unhone failaayaa he, use kaise samete
 The pace of the film becomes very slow
 screenple bhi behad kharaab he
 If we look at the acting front, Rakul Preet Singh manages to win the heart
 film kii jaan rakul preet singh hai or jab bhi ve screen par aati hai, darshakon ke chehre par chamak daud jaati he
 Tabu has done a good acting, but Ajay Devgn is not very involved in this role, and in the case of acting, he is seen out somewhere
 kul milakar unki acting bahut hi everej rahi he
 It can also be said that they seem misfit somewhere in this role, the direction of 'de De Pyaar De' is very weak and the story is also derailed
 haalanki film kaa sangeet jarur mjedaar he, or un songs par rakul preet singh ko dekhnaa vaaki acha anubhav he
 The connection connecting the youth in the film also appears to be missing
 aise main 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' niraash karti he

 com The revelations made by the American cyber expert about EVM just before the Lok Sabha elections have caused a bit of an uproar in Indian politics
 in daavon ko sattadhari dal bhartiya janata party or chunaav ayog ne niraadhaar bataaya he, jabaki congress ne is masale par jaanch kii maang kii he
 Now, in this case, the Indian Journalist Association (IJA) chief Ashish Ray has come out with a clarification, in which he has given a statement on the revelations of the expert and the presence of Congress leader Kapil Sibal in the press conference
 ashish re kaa kahana he ki IJA is prakaar kii press conference pehle bhi yojit karaata rahaa he
 Many allegations about evms made by Syed Shuja here are shocking, which is why many people are having problems with this
 unhone kaha ki export dwaara jo daawey kiye gaye hai, vah kai tarah ke sawaalon ko khadaa karte hai aise main inaki jaanch honi chahie
 However, he also said that people will not believe it until experts show EVM hacked
 unhone kaha ki hamane is press conference main shaamil hone ke liye chunaav ayog or anya raajnneetik dalon ko bhi nimantran bheja tha, lekin koi bhi nahin aayaa
 On the presence of Sibal, he also said about the presence of Congress leader Kapil Sibal in the press conference, he said that we had called the party presidents, but on Sibal's presence he felt that he had come from the Congress
 haalanki baad main party ne inkaar kar diya
 He said that Kapil Sibal just attended the press conference, he did not ask any questions
 haalanki, ashish re ne ye bhi kaha ki sibar export ne hamen niraash kiya, kyonki jis live hekking kii baat hui thi vah nahin ho pai
 But it is not that we should not listen to them
 ashish re ne is dauraan chunaav ayog or unke bich kii baatcheet ko bhi saajha kiya
 What was the expert's claim? Significantly, in a press conference held in London, American cyber expert Syed Shuja claimed that the 2014 Lok Sabha election in India was rigged
 or in chunaavon main iviem main hekking hui thi, jiske dampar bhartiya janata party ne prachand jeet hasil kii thi
 The expert has also claimed that he had done hacking for the Aam Aadmi Party in the 2015 Delhi assembly elections
 haalanki, in sabhi daavon ko bhartiya janata party ne khaarij kiya he
 On Tuesday, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called these allegations false and said that all these are Congress sponsored
 unhone kaha ki congress haikar ke jariye bharat ke loktantr ko badnaam kar rahi he
 At the same time, Kapil Sibal has also given clarification about his presence
 unhone kaha he ki vah congress party ke pratinidhi ke rup main nahin, balki vyaktigat bulaave par is press conference main gaye the
 He also said that the things that cyber experts have said should be investigated
 maldive kii sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko desh main apatkaal ghoshit kar diya he
 With this, the security forces have gained considerable powers
 desh kii rajdhani maale ke saath hi ek resort par hathiyaar or visphotak milane ke baad apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 Presidential spokesman Muez Ali tweeted, 'maldives has declared an emergency for 30 days from 12 noon on Wednesday
 ' aadhikarik sutron ke mutabik, maale main khadi ek lorie main hathiyaar or visphotak milane ke baad apatkaal lagu kiya gaya
 He said explosives have also been found at a resort in the peninsula
 inamen se kuch hathiyaarmaldiverashtriya suraksha bal ke shastraagaar ke hai
 "how did the weapons come out of the arsenal?" The officer said that at present, it is being investigated who is responsible for bringing these explosives and how these weapons came out of the arsenal
 yah kadam raashtrapati ke naav par visphot ke silsile main 25 aktubar ko uparashtrapati ahamed adib kii giraftaar ke kuch dinon baad uthaaya gaya he
 Officials called it an attempt to assassinate the President

 He was finally arrested from the ashram of Indore late Saturday after a high voltage drama that led to the arrest of spiritual guru Asaram for sexual exploitation charges
 asaram kii giraftaar ke baad peedit ladki ke parivaar waalon ummid jataai he ki unhen insaaf jarur milegaa
 Asaram, imprisoned after the arrest of Asaram, was caught in the clutches of the new Ashapulpis, and the family of the victim's girl's trust in the police increased
 is parivaar main ek nai ummid jaagi ki shaayad unki naaballig beti ko insaaf mil jayega
 The father of the victim's girl broke the hunger strike in up's Shahjahanpur in order to get justice for the girl
 asaram kii giraftaar kii khabar ne is pita ko raahat di he
 After Asaram's arrest, the fast of the victim's father was broken by drinking lemonade, and the victim's father again reiterated that he will fight till the end to get Asaram punished
 peedit ladki ke parivaar ko mil rahi hai dhamkiyanhaalanki asaram ke khilaaf cese darj karwaane ke baad se hi is parivaar ko dhamkiyaan mil rahi hai, lekin peedit ladki ke pita ne kaha he ki wo in dhamkiyon se darane vaale nahin hai
 Police has also registered a case against the man who threatened the victim's family

 He said that no one has asked him anyway

 jinhone logon se jhuthe vaade kiye kaam nahin kiya
 He only showed dreams to the general public
 'shila dikshit se chunaav ladane ke bare main jab poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'pichley chunaav main mujhe jawaab mil chukaa he
 i accept that
 kaam karo phir bhi uskaa phayda nahin hota
 When Sheila Dixit was asked if she would lead the Congress, her reply was, 'congress has collective leadership
 hamaare yahaan sab milakar kaam karenge
 When the former Chief Minister was asked that the Delhi Assembly elections are seen as a battle between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party, do you consider the Congress on the backfoot? His reply was, 'look we did not start campaigning, both BJP and Aam Aadmi Party are campaigning
 hamen aane to dijie maidan main
 When Sheila Dixit ji was asked that Kejriwal said that no one could do the work they did, what do you say? He replied, 'he is praising himself

 But this discussion of regret is about his uniform rather than his better performance, which was worn by team members for the first time in the past
 nae uniform main laal, pilaa or ujle rang kesath hi neude color (sharir ke ang kaa rang) kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Interestingly, the use of nude color has been done there, where it would have been better if the ingarments were used
 colombia mahila cycle team beete saptaah ek tour par gai thi
 For the first time, the team members were given a new uniform
 jaahir taur par uniform ko lekar team main utsaah tha, lekin ise pahante hi team members kuch bhi bolne-samajhane se jhijak rahe hai
 According to team members, the problem of using the nude color in the uniform becomes worse when the angle of light changes and it looks exactly like body parts
 soshal network par charchaaon kaa daurane uniform main team members kii tasviir saamne aate hi soshal network khaskar twitor par ise lekar charchaa kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 While some people advised to change the uniform immediately, many people took a dig at the designer, calling it a 'dress disaster'

 Minister Beni Prasad Vermane has spoken on Mulayam Singh Yadav, the worst attack ever
 apane sansadeey kshetra main benny babu aavesh main aa gaye or mulaayam par jamkar bhadaas nikaali
 Union Steel Minister had come to lay the foundation stone of ITI College in a village of Meghoun Legislative Assembly of Gonda, but his statement about how bitter he is within the Samajwadi Party government of the state is very clear
 benny prasad ne kaha he ki mulaayam singh yadav gunda hai or unke sambandh aatankwaadiyon se hai
 When Beni Babu came off the stage, and when asked about his speech, he refused to repeat the stage
 shaayad manch par wo aavesh main apane puraane netaa ke bare main bol gaye
 Such a bid by Beni about Netaji i
e
 Mulayam Singh, the Samajwadi Party could hardly digest
 benny babu ke bayaan par samaajawaadee party ke netaa ram aasare kushvaha ne kaha ki benny prasad pagal ho gaye hai
 Beni Babu speaks less, but when he speaks, something goes wrong
 kisko mantri banaaya jaae or kisko nahin, congress alaakaman ke liye ye tay karnaa mushkil sabit ho rahaa he
 According to the figures, the UPA government's cabinet can have 79 ministers
 inamen se 19 ko pehle hi shapath dilaai ja chuki he
 Out of the remaining 60 ministerial posts, 18 are contested by TMC, DMK, NCP and National Conference
 42 mantri congress apane liye rakh sakati he
 This time, if the number of Congress mps has increased in the elections, the list of ministerial contenders has also increased
 phir kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki rahul chaahate hai ki mantrimandal main youth brigade ko or tarjeeh diya jaae
 In such a situation, the Congress is unable to decide who to please and who is angry
 iske alaava mantralayon ke bantwaare kaa mudda bhi ahm he
 Twenty years before today, when India and Israel's relationship became normal, no one could say at that time that these two countries would come so close
 vyapaar or usamen paraspar sahyog to chhod dijie, ye bahut baad main aate hai
 The real point connecting the two is the strategic sector: Israel has become India's most trusted arms supplier today and the two countries have started ambitious cooperation in arms production
 yah baat haalanki kam hi log jaanate hai ki israel ne sabase pehle 1962 main bharat ko china yuddh main hathiyaar dene kii peshkash kii thi
 In that war, India's poor preparedness on the strategic front was exposed
 israeli sutron kii maane to tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru is shart par hathiyaar kharidne ko taiyaar the ki un par israel kii muhar na ho
 Israel refused to accept the condition
 israel ke vartmaan raashtrapati shimon perej 1953 main raksha mantralay sanbhaalane vaale sabase kam umr ke diarector-general bane
 He was just 29 then
 baad main 1959 main ve mantri bhi hue
 Since then, he has been witness to an entire chapter of history

 Delhi is still indifferent to his visit, although S

 Krishna made his first official visit to Israel as foreign minister

 je
 In an exclusive interview with Akbar, he politely shared this point
 unhone isaki pushti bhi kii, ki israel ne 1962 main bharat ko hathiyaaron kii peshkash kii thi jise nehru ne thukraa diya
 Did Israel offer arms to India after the China War in 1962 and did Nehru decline the offer? Yes, three things are worth noting
 ek yah ki nehru bheetar se democrate kism ke shaks the, duusare unka jhukaav rus kii ore tha or tisare, england se judaav khatm nahin hua tha
 He proposed to Mountbatten to become the President of India
 (sampadak kii tippaneeh yah pad bharat ke governor-general kaa tha, jise mountbeton ne sweekaar kar liya tha
 ) Yes, they did accept, but between 1947 and 1950 we had an independent colony
 takneekee rup se ham aaazaad nahin the
 Yes, Nehru invited all British administrators to remain in India
 yah aisi mili-juli niti thi jo behad jatil thi

 M
 krishna ne kaha tha ki bharat or israel jaise swaabhaavik sahyogiyon ko aatankwaadiyon par lagaam kasne or antat unke safaaye kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 But did they discuss who the terrorist is? Yes, there was talk
 or hamane unki pahchaan bhi ki-ve aatankwaadi jinhen aap jaanate hai or ve jinhen aap nahin jaanate
 Today the largest terrorist country is Iran
 iran or uske atomi kisse dohraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Hezbollah of Iran is destroying Lebanon
 hamaas philstin ko barbaad karne main laga he
 And right now, people of Hezbollah who were trying to kill some Israelites in Thailand were caught
 aaj aatankwaad kii dhuree iran he or vahiin se tamaam sanghathan punap rahe hai
 But the problem today is something else: the fight is between democratic forces which have the support of the people
 lekin aatank failaane main isaki jarurat nahin hoti
 i saw how much trouble India faced in its efforts to arouse democratic spirit to fight terrorism, whereas terrorism is anti-democracy
 yah kanoon kii kadra nahin karata
 Had it been under control, all your mps would have been killed
 haa, aap 13 disambar kii baat kar rahe hai
 
 
 But have you tried to persuade India that Iran is a terrorist country, or that it is supporting terrorism? Do you know that India has very good relations with Iran? No, i did not make any such attempt
 main jaanata tha ki donon ke rishte achche hai
 But i think that in this new world, instead of fighting the enemy, it is more important to fight the dangers
 aatank aaj vaishvik ho chukaa he
 It has no flag
 iskaa koi naam nahin
 And the problem of all countries is that globalism is embarrassing nationalism in a way
 chunki ab rashtriya arthvyavasthaaen rah nahin gayi, ek vaishvik arthvyavastha kaayam he, lihaaja vichaar nahin badale hai, halaat badal gaye hai
 You see that till now we have been defining this world by geography
 jameen vaastavik ikai he jo baantati he, simaaen banaati he
 You understand the nature of land, know its products, based on which national resources are calculated
 lekin jis pal vigyaan ne jameen kii jagah lee, yah paribhaasha khatm ho gai
 Science does not know boundaries, nor does it have different presidents
 sab kuch badal gaya he
 After all, how can you define modern reality in terms of nations only? Suppose there is a 27-year-old young man with no army, no political party, no police force, no one knows about him nor does he know anything about himself
 
 
 lekin jab vah fasebuk par apana account kholta he to vah ek samrajya khadaa kar letaa he
 This kingdom has not only economic but also social impact
 is baat kaa andaja na to adam smith ko tha, na hi karl marks ko
 They would have been shocked to see this
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ham aisi duniya main rah rahe hai jise ham nahin jaanate
 It is wonderful to see the changing ways of war, but for now let's return to the indo-israeli relationship: If we do not have one definition of terror, how will we be able to cooperate? For example, will India cooperate against Hamas, which is a terrorist in your eyes but not in the eyes of India? The kind of world we live in today has better informal relationships than diplomatic relations
 aatank ke khilaaf ladaai main kootnithik rishton ke mukaable guptchar sevaayen zyada kargar hoti hai
 Since terror is not a national agenda but a global phenomenon which is modern and also fast, and the biggest thing is that if the chances of loss are high, it can choose a place for any reason
 lihaaja hamen ek-duusare ko cheta kar, soochna dekar hamalon se bachane main sahyog karnaa hi hoga
 Obviously, you would never want something like this in a hotel in India or in Parliament
 israel is maamle main bada badakismat rahaa haih hamaare yahaan krishi ke naam par kuch nahin he jabaki suraksha ke naam par hamaare yahaan bahut kuch he
 So we had to become experts
 jahaan tak hamaara sawaal he, ham maanate aae hai ki awwal hindustan ek samskruti he
 We have to understand that India is a very cultured country, it has its own vision, it has its own symbols
 yah aisi neeras cheez nahin jise kootnithik maansikta ke daayre main sameta ja sake
 Let me give you an example
 hamaare zyaadaatar bachche bharat ja rahe hai
 
 
 This makes them feel spiritual
 main to ab yah tak maanane laga hum ki ek lihaaj se gandhi paigambar the
 And the Prophet today is more important than the emperors
 lihaaja, ham judaav mahasoos karte hai
 Does Mossad support the Indian government in Kashmir? i don't know, and even if i know, i won't answer it (laughs)
 intelligence meraa kshetra nahin he
 To save lives, we can definitely make suggestions for internal security
 maine yah sawaal aapse isliye poocha kyonki bharat par lagaataar hamale karne vaale aatanki samoohon main ek lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa sargana lahore main rahata he
 He believes that India, Israel and America are his three biggest enemies
 samrik sambandh sirf dosti ke naam par to nahin banate, uske liye dushman kaa bhi dushman hona hi padataa he
 So have the terrorists brought India and Israel together? The thing is good but it is not always effective
 nai paribhaasha main dushmano kii jagah khataron ne le lee he
 Do you consider Pakistan's nuclear bomb as a threat to yourself? See, the problem is who will be holding it (pakistani bomb)
 bam apane aap nahin dagate
 For example, if Switzerland has a bomb, i can not say with a claim, but i can say that not many people will panic
 lekin bam agar uttari korea ke paas ho, to dikkat ho jaati he
 So, it depends on who is in control of Pakistan
 lekin pakistan apane bam ko pakistani nahin, islamic bam kahata he
 What is the meaning of this name? Look at the world, they have no place
 main to kahata hum ki aakhir 'islam' chahta kya he? kya jameen jeetna or rashtron ko tabah karnaa? main allaah ko samaj saktaa hum lekin unhen samajhnaa mere liye mushkil he jo uske naam kaa galat istemaal karte hai
 The message of Allah is friendship, love and understanding
 isliye aap jab mujhase puuchhenge ki musalmaan kya he, to main puuchhuunga ki un musalamaanon kii siyasat kya he?kya aapako lagata he ki pakistan kattarpathiyon yaa charampanthiyon ke haathon main ja rahaa he?pataa nahin, kyonki kattarpanthi jo nuskhe muslim aadamiyon or auraton ko dete hai, unke nattejey ulate hote hai
 Take the case of both West Asia and Pakistan
 asal dikkat siyasat nahin he, balki garibi he, bhukh he, berogari he
 On the other hand, if they start punishing themselves, such as not giving women equal status as men, then what is the purpose? What i mean is that money alone cannot cure poverty
 hindustan ko bachaane na to rus kaa paisa aayaa na hi america kaa, balki uske bheetar badlaav kii andruni tadap thi jo bahut gahari thi
 So when you talk about Muslims, i ask which Muslim are you talking about? i do not see any contradiction between science and Islam, but what is pulling most of the countries of West Asia back is the men who do not want to give equal status to their women
 ve auraton ko adhikaar nahin dena chaahate
 Women do not have equal status in the governments there
 mujhe isse kya fark padegaa, lekin kam se kam apane liye to ve sochate or langik samanta kaayam karte
 If you don't do this, you will remain poor
 islam ne to mahilaon se bhedbhaav baratane ko kaha nahin he
 Is not Israel also becoming weaker in gender equality due to the rise of ultra-radicals? According to today's Jerusalem Post news, they don't want women to sing? They are a minority 
 aap khud akhbaar ke dhandhe main hai
 My point about that news is that the danger in it was not as great as the sensation, whose strength you felt
 iconomist patrika ke 10 disambar ke ank ke mutabik, desh main sattarudh gathbandhan ke bheetar 40 fisadi roodhiwaadee yahudee hai or sena ke 40 fisadi nae afasar ladaake hai
 This number will not be called small? It is not
 ho saktaa he ki unamem mahilaon ke virdohi hon, lekin ve 40 main se sirf 3 fisadi hai
 Newspapers do not differentiate between them
 kattarpanthi kuch sau yaa hajaar honge, bas! lekin maamla chunki sansanikhej he, isliye surkhiyon main jagah bana letaa he
 Do you see Iran as a threat to Israel's existence? i consider Iran a threat to the whole world
 main ise sirf israel kii samasya nahin maanata! dekhie, ve hamen tarjeeh bhi nahin dete
 They are so rude
 ve kehete hai ki agar sabase bada shaitan america he, to uske baad ham (israel) hai
 They say profanity, discriminate
 mujhe lagata he ki iran kii mahatvakanksha kii vajah se zyaadaatar arab desh ghabaraae hue hai
 They want to establish their supremacy in West Asia in the name of religious control
 israel ke raksha mantri ehud baraak ne kaha tha ki iran ko bam taiyaar karne ke liye sirf nau maheene chahie
 Does it mean that there has to be a war? (editor's note: On February 15, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad inaugurated three new nuclear projects, saying, "the list of the fighting initiatives of the world's crocodile forces is very long
" unhone duniya ko lut liya he
 ') i think there are other ways
 sainya karrwai se shuruyaat karne kii kya jarurat? main sirf israel kii baat nahin kar rahaa, puri duniya kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Sanctions have started working
 iran main masalaa bam nahin he balki vahaan kii hukumat kii fitrat he
 The issue is not just that they are making bombs but that they want to bring destruction
 is saal unhone bagaiyr sunwaayee ke 600 logon ko faansee de di
 After this he said that all these people were gay
 ve logon ko maarthe hai
 They send their terrorists to South America
 saudi arab ke rajanyik ko hi le lijie jise ve maarna chaahate the
 They are murderers and deceived
 dekhie, meri jo umr he or meraa jitna anubhav he, uske hisaab se main iran ko bhrashtachar ke pratik ke rup main dekhtaa hum
 Of course you would mean Hukumat, not Iran
 agar iran main hukumat badal jaae to kya vah aapako manjuur hoga?iskaa jawaab main kyon duun? mujhe lagata he ki hamen yah baat samajni chahie ki agar vahaan hukumat badalati he to shaayad vah bam na banaae
 Is the security rationale behind the Israeli bomb? We first built an atomic reactor base, then announced that Israel had prepared an atomic option, not because we needed Hiroshima (demolition), but rather we wanted Oslo (peace)
 israel vaigyanik anusandhan main shakti kaa centre hoga
 Egypt's leader and diplomat Amr Musa came to me one day and said, "why don't you take me to show the nuclear reactor close to Dimona?" i asked, "are you crazy?" You will see our people laughing and then stop doubting
 ye hamaare liye nuksaandaayak hoga, kyonki aapkaa shaq hi hamen atomi avarohak kii takat detaa he
 "do you think that Iran has created an area full of uncertainty with Natanj and its nuclear program? How? They do not need it
 israel ko to iran se bhi khatra he
 But who will be threatened by Iran? They do not need to do this
 hamen thi or hamane aisa kiya, lekin kaaphi sanyam or samajhadaari ke saath
 (editor's note: Indications are that Iran is creating uncertainty)
 aapako kya lagata he ki kahaan aakar maamla nirnaayak ho jayega? masalan, agar iran hormuj kii khadi ko band kar detaa he to kya yah jang chhidane kii paryaapt vajah ho sakati he?ham apni sena ko hormuj nahin bhejte hai, lekin america ise bardaasht nahin karegaa
 England will not allow this to happen
 yahaan tak ki koi bhi iran ko aisa nahin karne degaa
 The Gulf of Hormuz is the international oilway and no one can be allowed to stop this lifeline
 kya aap arab main hue andolan par chaunke the?main shekhi nahin baghaaroonga, lekin mujhe yakeen tha aisa hoga
 This movement is happening all over the world and you cannot avoid it
 yah bilkul nai duniya he
 It happened that the new generation was more educated and used modern equipment
 
 
 usne kaha, dekho ham ub chuke hai, hamaare paas naukariyaan nahin hai, hamen pataa nahin ki ham kya karen, apni jindagi ham taanaashaahee hukumaton or bhrashtachar aadi par barabaad kiye ja rahe hai
 
 
 How do you see its results? Once again in Barak, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood (ikhwanul Muslimeen) in Egypt is a matter of concern for Israel? First of all, whatever is happening in Egypt, Israel has no say in that
 iske baavjood agar brotherhud khatra he, to mistra kii nai peedi ek ummid he
 i do not think it is a clash of civilizations, rather it is a clash of generations
 mujhe yakeen he ki mistra main yuva peedi kii jeet hogi kyonki puraani peedi ko nahin maaloom ki ki apane logon kii buniyadi jaruraton ko kaise puraa kiya jaae
 As far as we are concerned, the better the options for them, the better they will be as our neighbors
 ham arab yaa musalamaanon se mahaj isliye nafrat nahin karte ki ve arab yaa musalmaan hai
 The world has become global both economically and ideologically; For example, i think globalism will eventually eliminate racism
 bilkul
 But young people are also changing the nature of the conflict — attacks from Saudi Arabia via the Internet

 But we have youths on the Internet - Israeli, Arab, Palestinian - talking

 So, these are the two faces of the Internet
 israel is baat ko lekar itnaa aashwast kaise he ki syria main bashar al-asad ke din ab puure ho gaye?har hatyare kii ek had hoti he
 He commits a lot of murders, when people demand his removal, he commits more murders
 aaj taanashaah badi vikat sthitiyon main ji rahe hai kyonki unhone teen chijen ganvaa di hai: ve logon ko andhaa nahin banaae rakh sakate kyonki jaankaree paane ke tamaam aujaar ab uplabdh hai
 They cannot reap the wealth of their citizens because it is no longer easy to fool them
 or ab ve apni fouj ke bharose bhi nahin rah sakate kyonki fouj apane hi nagarikon par goli nahin daagna chaahati
 That is why i do not see the future of dictators right
 syria kaa raashtrapati taanashaah he, hatyara he

 unhone kaha, ‘ant main do hi vikalp bachate hai
 Life imprisonment or hanging '

 In South India, it is said to be the beginning of bjp's move, so the challenge is going to be bigger for the Congress in the coming days
 aaie jaanate hai ki congress kii is haar kii kya paanch badi vajahen raheen
 
 
 1
 anti inkamabency factorkarnataka ko rajya main anti inkamabasi factor kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The Congress government led by CM Siddaramaiah failed to woo the people despite schemes like Indira Canteen
 congress or bijepi donon ke menifesto main mahilaon ko aarakshan, yuvaaon ko shiksha or rojgaar ke bharose jaise tamaam vaade lagbhag ek jaise hi the
 However, during the Congress rule, the BJP surrounded the state government on issues like corruption and not implementing central schemes and funds
 2
 Modi's answer is no, Prime Minister Narendra Modi commanded the campaign on behalf of the BJP in these elections
 is dauraan party adhyaksh amit shah ne unka kadam-dar-kadam saath diya
 In his campaign, Modi appeared to be fighting alone in the war of words from Congress President Rahul Gandhi to CM Siddaramaiah
 congress kii ore se rahul gandhi ne jamkar campaning kii, lekin piem modi apni cabinet ke mantriyon, kai rajyon ke siem ke saath chunaav prachaar main utre or logon ko apane vaadon par bharosa karwaane main safal rahe
 3
 basapa or ensipi kaa jedies ke saath janaparamparik rup se dalit voters ko congress ke saath mana jaataa he
 In these elections, Bahujan Samaj Party contesting elections along with JDS was also harmful for the Congress
 iske alaava congress ko secular vot ke bantwaare kaa bhi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 In the name of competing with BJP, these voters got divided into Congress, NCP and JDS
 bahujan samaaj party or ensipi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye gaiyr bijepi, gaiyr congressi third front banane ke liye congress se chhitak rahi hai, yahi cheez congress ko baari padaa

 siddharmaiya ko khuli chhot or aantarik gutbajikarnataka chunaavon main congress main khemebaaji bhi dekhne ko mili
 Many Congress leaders were secretly opposed to giving open relaxation to CM Siddaramaiah in the party
 tikat bantwaare main bhi siddharmaiya kii hi chali
 In the coming days, one reason for the party's defeat will be searched in ticket distribution
 kai jagahon par enesayuai or youth congress ke yuva netaaon ko tikat mili to kai badi siton par congress ne jila or block str ke netaaon ko tikat die

 His tour to India was so far good
 orchha dekhne ke baad is dampati kaa aglaa padaav agra tha
 The Swiss couple, six feet tall, left Orchha on 15 March
 unhone datia tak kaa 49 kimi kaa safar cycle se tay kiya
 Since the day had ended, the couple decided to spend the night in the forest to make the journey more exciting and put their transparent tent under a palm tree just 50 meters from the Sevdha road
 tab unhen yah pataa nahin tha ki yah madhya pradesh he jahaan pichley saal desh main balaatkaar ke sabase zyada 3,406 maamle darj hue hai
 The place where they stayed was close to Jhadiya village in Datia district
 unhen agle din subah main taj nagari agra ke liye nikalnaa tha isliye ve jaldi sone kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 But then something happened that they may not have even thought about in their dreams
 raat 8 baje achaanak is dampati par musiibat tut padi
 Six armed men entered their tent with the intention of looting
 ye lutere vahaan se maatr aadha kimi dur apni basti se aae the
 Sensing the danger, the couple gave the robbers Rs 200-300
 de die lekin unki niyat kharaab ho chuki thi
 Two robbers tied a 30-year-old Swiss male's hands and beat him badly
 baaki lutere swiss mahila ko tent se baahar khinchakar le gaye or uske saath baari-baari se balaatkaar kiya
 During this time the two robbers were under the supervision of the woman's husband
 police ke mutabik, chah badmaashon ne switzraland ke lusaan ke rahane vaale is dampati se 10,000 ru
 Looted cash, a laptop and a mobile
 police ke ek ucch adhikari bataate hai, ''swiss purush ne paardarshee tent ke andar se shaayad apni patni ke saath gang rape hote na dekha ho, kyonki uskaa motaa chashma chin liya gaya tha
 "both the foreign tourists, terrified by the havoc with them, somehow got into a small event running on the other side of the falling main road
 unhone vahaan maujuud logon se police stesan kaa pataa poocha
 Seeing their condition, people came forward for help
 ek vyakti ne unhen apni motorcycle par bithakar raat 10 baje ke lagbhag civil lines police stesan pahunchaa diya
 But the difficulties were not yet over for the couple
 police stesan pahunchane ke baad dampati ne pulimakarmiyon ko apni aapbeetee bataani chaahi
 But both the tourists were speaking English and there was no person who understood English at the police station
 iske baad police waalon ne swiss purush se apni shikaayat likhakar dene ko kaha
 When the police could not figure out any other way to understand what the complaint was, he asked the professor of Government PG College, Datia, Dr
 ratan suryavanshi se sampark saadhaa
 Dr
 unhone paryatak dampati kii shikaayat kaa hindi main anuwaad kiya tab jaakar police ko asal baat samaj ai
 Dr

 They numbered six to seven
 aropiyon kii giraftaar ke baad unki baat sahi sabit hui
 Unfortunately, despite reaching the police station and registering a complaint, the couple's troubles did not end
 dard se karaahati mahila ko ilaaj ke liye datia laayaa gaya, jo rajya ke swasthya mantri narottam mishra kaa nirvachan kshetra bhi he
 But the district hospital here did not have a single female doctor
 aakhirkaar mahila ko medical test or ilaaj ke liye yahaan se 75 kimi dur gwalior ke aspataal main laana padaa
 But despite the treatment here, the victim was not satisfied
 tab use dilli bhejne kaa nirnay liya gaya
 According to a police officer, "the victim was afraid that she would not get AIDS and that she would not become pregnant
" '' agle din dampati ne police se anurodh kiya ki unhen dilli main unke duutavas pahunchaa diya jaae

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has targeted industrialist Mukesh Ambani, who recently said that Mumbai belongs to all Indians
 shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main thakare ne likhaa he, ‘marathi logon kaa mumbai par utana hi adhikaar he jitna mukesh ambani kaa reliance company par
 Thackeray said, "mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra and will remain its capital
 mumbai or marathi maanush kii raah main dakhal mat do
 Thackeray said, "when Pandit Mukesh Ambani says that Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi are all Indians, why does he leave cities like Ahmedabad, Jamnagar and Rajkot
" ’ ullekhneey he ki reliance industries ke adhyaksh mukesh ambani ne haal main kaha tha ki mumbai main taxi permit ke liye marathi bhashaa kaa gyaan anivaary bananaa ‘durbhagyapurna’ he or mahanagar sabhi bharatiyon kaa he
 During a discussion at the London School of Economics, he recently said, "first of all we are Indians

 damn is true
 ’isse pehle beete saal november main shivasena pramukh isi mudde par sachin tendulkar ko raajnneeti se dur rahane kaa paraamarsh de chuke hai
 Thackeray then said, "sachin should confine himself to cricket and not interfere on the political pitch"
 thakare ne tab likhaa tha, ‘‘aisi tippaniyan karke sachin marathi maanas kii pich par ran out ho gaye hai
 You were not even born when Marathi manas got Mumbai and 105 Marathi people sacrificed their lives for Mumbai

 Assembly elections are going to be held in the state this year
 iske liye chaar maah se bhi kam kaa vakt bachaa he
 On the other hand, regional parties are engaged in making a dent in the vote bank of both BJP and Congress
 lihaaja apni haar jeet ke samikarnon ko dhyaan main rakhkar bijepi or congress jaise bade dal kshetreey dalon ke saamne natmastak najar aa rahe hai
 Traditionally there has been a direct contest between BJP and Congress in Chhattisgarh, but this time by jumping into the fray of BSP, Janata Dal Y, Sharad Yadav's Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party, Gondwana Ganatantra Party and Chhattisgarh Adivasi Mahasabha Congress and BJP are seeing their equations completely deteriorating
 kshetreey partiyaan bijepi or congress donon ke vot bank par sendhamari karne main juty hui hai
 Due to this, both the big national parties are in danger

 While BJP got 41 per cent of the total voting, the Congress got 40
 03 fisadi vot mili the
 The Congress lost power due to less than 1% of the vote, thus the Congress lost power due to just one percent vote, while the remaining twenty percent of the votes went to the accounts of other parties including BSP
 lihaaja is baar bijepi ko dhul chataane ke liye congress uske tamaam virodhiyon ko ekajute karne main juty hui he, taaki mat vibhaajan se bachaa ja sake
 For this, the Congress has strategically found a way to join hands with the BSP

 uski daleel he ki varsh 2011 kii janaganana main adivaasiyon kii jansankhya main 10 fisadi se zyada kii badhotaree hui he
 Therefore, the reservation they are currently getting should be increased to 35 percent
 adivaasiyon kii is maang ko bijepi or congress donon ne hi najar andaaj kiya he
 So now the tribals are also preparing to enter the electoral arena to teach a lesson to both parties

 (from input language) bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se sambaddh ram madhav ne jammu kashmir ke vartmaan halaat ke maddenjar kaha he ki (AFSPA) jaise kanoon maje ke bajaay jarurat par lagaae jate hai
 Governments should create an atmosphere of adequate peace within the state to remove it
 is bich bhaajapa jammu kashmir main pidipi ke saath milakar do sansadeey siton or 6 emelsi kii siton par chunaav ladane kii ranneeti taiyaar kar rahe hai
 BJP has taken a tough stand on AFSPA BJP has taken a strong stand on Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's demand to reconsider AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir
 is par ram madhav kehete hai ki aise kanoonmaje ke bajaay jaruratke tahat lagaae jate hai
 Also, they say that such laws are removed as soon as the situation in any state improves
 ram madhav ne kaha ki ve srinagar or anantnag kii do sansadeey siton parpidipi or bijepike ladane kaa faisla ravivaar ko karenge

 arabiai ne disambar se ab tak repo rate main 1
 There is a 10 per cent cut, repo rate 5 after this deduction
 40 fisadi par aa gaya habite dinon rigerv bank of india ke governor shaktikant das ne sabhi bainkon se byaaj daron ko repo rate se link karne kii apil kii
 But even after the RBI Governor's appeal, only a few banks implemented it
 ahm baat ye he ki jinhone repo rate se byaaj daron ko jodne kaa faisla liya he, wo sabhi sarkari bank hai
 Other large private banks, including HDFC, Axis and ICICI, have remained silent
 haalanki beete shuukravaar ko vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne yah jarur bataaya ki bank ab repo rate ko byaaj dar se link karne par raji ho gaye hai
 But still no private bank has explained the situation
 linking main SBI sabase agearabiai governor kii salaah maanane waalon main sabase pehla bank bhartiya state bank (SBI) tha
 Last May, SBI linked FD to repo rate
 iske baad SBI ke nae graahakon ko 1 july se home yaa auto lone par repo rate linking kii suvidha milane lagi
 Now from September 1, SBI has talked about providing this facility to its old customers
 SBI kii tarj par saarvajanik kshetra ke bank of baroda or union bank ne bhi lone ko repo rate se link karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Apart from this, Bank of Maharashtra (bom) has also linked retail loans to repo rate
 isi tarah sindicket bank or elahabaad bank bhi ab repo rate linkd lone kii peshkash karne vaale hai
 What is the situation? At present, different loan interest rates are based on an internal benchmark such as the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) and the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR)
 is benchmark par bhi bainkon kii byaaj daren repo rate par hi aadhaarit hoti hai lekin yah anivaary prakriya nahin hoti
 This is to say that even after the rbi's repo rate cut, there is no pressure on banks to reduce the interest rate
 vah apane mutabik byaaj daron main katautee karte hai
 Explain that the repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends to banks
 bank isi aadhaar par graahakon ko karj muhaiyaa karaate hai
 The banks get relief from the low repo rate
 iske baad bank karj ko kam byaaj dar par graahakon tak pahunchaa sakate hai
 What is the status of the current system? In fact, in the year 2016, the MCLR system was adopted
 iskaa makasad, policy daron main badlaav kaa phayda bank graahakon ko teji se pahunchaana tha
 However, it did not yield good results as expected
 maujuuda sthiti main bainkon kii manamaani bhi saamne ai he
 For example, since December last year, the Reserve Bank of India has held a review meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) four times
 arabiai ne har baar repo rate main katautee kii he
 But the benefit of this deduction has not been given to the general public as expected
 vartmaan main repo rate 5
 Has come to 40 percent
 nae badlaav se aapako kya hoga phayda?repo rate ko byaaj dar se linking kii vyavastha lagu hone kaa sidhaa phayda aapako milegaa
 In fact, whenever the Reserve Bank cuts the repo rate, it will become mandatory for banks to cut the interest rate
 iskaa asar yah hoga ki aapaki auto lone or home lone samet anya lone kii iemai dar main kami aegi
 Not only this, the system will become more transparent than before, after the system of linking loan to repo rate is implemented
 isse har karj lene vaale vyakti ko byaaj dar ke bare main pataa hoga
 They will also know what profit the banks are taking
 iske alaava graahak bainkon ke lone kii byaaj daron kii bhi tulana kar sakenge
 The RBI may increase strictly, so banks have not been given any specific instructions from the central bank to link the repo rate
 lekin, beete dinon governor shaktikant das ne ise anivaary karne ke sanket jarur die
 Recently Shaktikanta Das said, "I think now is the right time to formalize linking of new loans with external standards like repo rate
 ham nigaraanee kar rahe hai or jaruri kadam uthaaenge
 "with this, the RBI governor said that we will play our role as regulators
 maharashtra ke jalgaanv main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha he ki vah virodhiyon ko chunauti dete hai ki agar unamem himmat he to is chunaav main bhi or aane vaale chunaavon main bhi apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main ye elaan karen ki ve anuchhed 370 (article 370)ko waapas laaenge

 Look at the statements of congress-ncp leaders in the last few months
 'jammu-kashmir kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki jo puraa desh sochataa he, usase ekadam ulta inaki (vipaksh) soch dikhti he
 Their synergy with the neighboring country is similar
 pie modi ne kaha ki aaj durbhaagya ke saath kahana pad rahaa he ki hamaare desh ke kuch raajnneetik dal, kuch rajaneta, rashtrahit main liye gaye is nirnay par raajnneeti karne main jute hai
 PM Modi said, 'you will be surprised to know that our Valmiki brothers of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were also denied human rights for 70 years
 aaj main bhagwaan valmiki ke charnon main naman karte hue kahata hum ki mujhe apane un bhaaiyon ko gale lagane kaa saubhaahgya mil rahaa he'
 Jammu and Ladakh is not just a piece of land, it is the head of Mother Bharati, where particle by particle strengthens the power of India
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 5 agast ko aapaki bhaavana ke anuroop bhaajapa- NDA sarkaar ne ek abhootpurv faisla liya

 Today, New India is determined not to be bound by unnecessary bonds of the past
 modi ne kaha ki aaj nayaa bharat khud ke vartmaan ko majboot tak kar hi rahaa he, khud kaa bhavishya bhi tay kar rahaa he
 For some time now we have been continuously challenging the challenges, today the voice of India is listening strongly to every force of the world
 duniya kaa har desh aaj bharat ke saath khadaa hai, hamaare saath milakar aage badhane ke liye utsahit he ab nae bharat kaa nayaa josh, duniya ko bhi dikhne laga he

 At the same time, the general perception of the minister's move is that the government department is not working properly, so the minister himself has to clean the drains and drains

 Prasad, who had already thrown two bouncers, then bowled the ball closer to Ishant, who took a run in point

 Ishant then reached the bowler again

 Significantly, on the fourth day of the india-sri Lanka series and on the fourth day of the decisive Test, on Monday, Ishant, along with Ishant, also accused Dhammika Prasad, Dinesh Chandimal and Lahiru Thirimane
 isisi ne twitor par likhaa tha, 'eshanth sharma, dinesh chandimal, lahiru thirimane or dhammika prasad ko isisi ne aropit kiya he

 However, when Ishant got close to Prasad while taking runs, this bowler said something to him

 When Prasad and Ishant were saying something to each other after this, Dinesh Chandimal, while passing by, collided with the Indian batsman and said something, which also angered Indian batsman Ravichandran Ashwin
 tippaniyan Ashwin drew the attention of umpires Road Tucker and Nigel Long, who then asked Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews to pacify his players

 saudi arab (saudi Arabia) bharat kii aarthik vruddhi kii sambhaavnaaon ko dekhte hue desh main petro rasayan, buniyadi sanrachana or khanan samet anya kshetron main 100 arab dollar nivesh karne kii sambhaavnaaen dekh rahaa he
 Ambassador of Saudi Arabia Dr
 Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati said that India is an attractive investment destination and Saudi Arabia is looking at long-term partnership in core sectors like oil, gas and mining
 unhone pitiai bhashaa se ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘‘saudi arab eendhan, parishodhan, petro rasayan, buniyadi sanrachana, krishi, khanij or khanan jaise kshetron main 100 arab dollar nivesh karne ke avasaron par gaur kar rahaa he
 Al Sati said Saudi Arabia's largest oil company Aramco's proposed partnership with India's Reliance Industries reveals the strategic nature of the energy relations between the two countries
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke tel aapurti, khudara eendhan bikri, petrorsayan or lubricant bazaar main aramko kii nivesh kii yojana in kshatron main company ke vaishvik vistaar kii ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 He said that from the vision of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, by 2030, there will be a significant expansion in trade and trade between the two countries in different areas
 saudi arab vijan 2030 ke tahat petroleum utpaadon par aarthik nirbharta kam karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 India buys 17 per cent crude oil and 32 per cent LPG from Saudi Arabia

 He said that there is bilateral trade of $ 34 billion between the two countries and there is no doubt that there will be an increase in it
 aramko ke ipo ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki yah company ko vistrut duniya ke sampark main laaegaa
 Asked about future relations with India, he said that the relationship between the two countries has already expanded beyond the supply of crude oil, petroleum products and LPG and focus on joint participation and investment in areas such as petrochemicals and exploration

 unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat dwaara saudi arab ko ranneetik petroleum bhandar main nivesh karne kaa nimantran diya janaa donon deshon ke bich aapasi bharose kaa saboot he
 '' yah pichley aam chunaav se hi dikhne laga tha ki upie sarkaar patan kii ore bad rahi he
 But now this speed of decline has become fatal
 upie ke liye ummid kii bas ek hi kiran najar aati haih karnataka main congress kaa ubhaar
 This emergence can only give very small relief
 india today-nilsan desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan ke mutabik, karnataka ke alaava puure bharat main upie, khaskar congress jis gati se siton par pakad khoti ja rahi he, uski agle aam chunaav (takneekee rup se 2014 kii shuruyaat main tay) tak bharpai asambhav ho sakati he
 In our last survey six months ago, we had said that despite being a small coalition, the NDA is competing with the UPA
 ab yah sthaayee rujhaan banataa dikh rahaa he
 NDA is now 15-20 seats ahead of UPA, which is enough for the change of power in Delhi
 aisa lagata he ki kabhi global brands kii pratishtha hasil karne vaale manmohan singh kaa ab koi mol hi nahin rahaa he
 The survey reveals people's anger towards UPA-2, which has shown shameless indifference towards good governance and national accountability
 bharat badlaav ke liye baichaiyn he
 If elections are held today, the NDA may get an edge
 upie 171 se 181 siton ke saath (2009 main 259 siten) endie se pichad jayega
 NDA can get respectable 195 to 205 seats (159 seats in 2009)
 teen saal main pehali baar endie sattarudh gathbandhan se kaaphi aage bad gaya he or vikalp kii aakanksha kii is teevr lahar ko isse or bal mila he ki bijepi achche shashan vaali party ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 After a long time, BJP is looking to rebuild its place in North India, but its stronghold Karnataka in the south seems to be collapsing
 congress ke liye vindhyachal ke paar khush hone kii yahi ekmaatr vajah ho sakati he
 Other major parties who give life to the UPA are also struggling to save themselves
 uttar pradesh main mulaayam singh virdohi hawa bahane lagi he or saaf taur par unke uttaradhikari par sankat haih pichley vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko vot dene vaale 15 fisadi log ab bijepi ke paale main aa gaye hai jisane congress se bhi 11 fisadi voter chin liye hai

 Here too, the biggest disadvantage is for the Congress: 16 percent of the voters who voted for it in the last assembly election have gone to the DMK
 mamata banerjee hi congress kii ekmaatr aisi sahyogi dikh rahi hai jinhone apane kile ko surakshit rakhaa he
 The power has not diminished his aura, but his temper has increased further
 rajyon main khel saaf he
 By institutionalizing the politics of revenge and harassment, the Congress has made itself largely irrelevant in Andhra Pradesh
 rajya ke 64 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main jagan mohan reddy ko sibiai jaanch ke daayre main laana rajnatik badale kii karrwai hi he
 His YSR Congress may emerge as the largest party in Andhra Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections
 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko vot dene vaale 47 fisadi log uskaa saath chhodkar viesar congress kii taraf chale gaye hai
 If assembly elections are held today, the YSR Congress, along with the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, can get more than half of the state's seats
 gujarat main congress narendra modi kii lokapriyata main send lagane main naakaam rahi he
 The Congress can come down from the 11 seats it won in the last general election here
 maharashtra or rajasthan se aane vaali khabaren bhi congress ke liye isi tarah niraashajanak hai
 The rise of Congress in Karnataka is not due to its own hard work but because of the suicidal politics of local BJP leaders
 aaj congress ke paas ek bhi netaa aisa nahin bachaa he jo kisi rajya kii janata ko pasand ho, centre main tehraav kaa daur he
 The survey is like a referendum for UPA 2 and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's downfall as an icon-embarrassing personality is now complete
 yah kisi or yug kii baat thi, jab sansad ke central haul main khele gaye ek bharpoor naatak main, vijayi bhav se bharin lekin bhavuk sonia gandhi ne apane chatukaaron kii bheed ke vilaap ko nazarandaaj karte hue unamem se sabase gaiyr-rajnatik vyakti ko pradhanmantri chunaa tha
 In his first term, Manmohan Singh earned his image as a wise man of the East on the global niche platforms thanks to his reassuring silence and professional seriousness
 lekin desh main vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ke kaale khel main unki tathakthith anubhavheenata ke boote ve aise gathbandhan main apni sweekaaryata bana rahe the jis par manje hue rajnatik jeevon kaa prabhutv tha
 His second term as Prime Minister proved to be unfortunate
 kabhi british pradhanmantri jon major ke liye kahi jane vaali baat aaj unke liye puri tarah se upyukt lagati haih ve ab bhi pad par hai lekin satta main nahin
 The irony is that the 2009 election proved to be an inviting misfortune, the highest point of his political life
 surveykshan main shaamil aadhe se zyada logon ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne unhen niraash kiya he, ve 2009 main bani ummid ke str par bhi bane rahane main naakaam sabit hue hai
 About 50 percent of the people believe that they have defended the corrupt to save their chair
 ve aisi sarkaar ke mukhiya hai jiske bare main ab aam dharna yah he ki vah sabhi morchon par naakaam ho chuki haih chaahe vah aarthik sudhaar hon, mahangaai par ankush yaa anya har kshetra main uskaa pradarshan
 This proves how Manmohan has disappointed the public within just three years
 ye vahi manmohan singh hai jo apane market vijan ke bal par pi
 V
 narsingh raav sarkaar ke vitt mantri ke rup main nabbe ke dashak main desh ko aarthik udaarikaran ke raste par le gaye the
 This is an irony they would like to forget: The glow of the Indian development story has faded just as the pioneer of modernity has become completely lethargic
 anumaan ke mutabik, naitik javabdehi kho chuki sarkaar ke pradhanmantri or pi
 Chidambaram, Sharad Pawar and A
 ke
 The functioning of many senior ministers, such as Antony, is assessed by most respondents as 'average'
 unke vyaktitv main ab aisa koi kavach nahin bachaa he jo bhrashtachar ko apni vishistataa bana lene vaali unki sarkaar ko janata ke abhiyog se bachaa sake
 Congress's PM in waiting Rahul Gandhi has also not got such numbers so that he can reduce the disappointment of his party

 Vaishno Devi cave temple situated on Trikuta mountain in Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir is not only India but one of the busiest pilgrimage place in the world
 trikuta parvat par sthit hone ke kaaran vaishno devi kaa ek naam trikuta devi bhi he
 Come, know some interesting things related to this cave temple and visit here: jis sthaan par vaishno devi pindiyon, devi kaali (daaen) or devi saraswati (baayen) or devi lakshmi (madhya), ke rup main gupha main virajit he, vah sthaan ‘mata rani kaa bhawan’ kehalaata he
 It is believed that here Vaishno Devi killed Bhaironath
 yatriyon ko vaishno devi kaa darshan karne ke liye katra main yatra parchi lenaa padatihai
 If it is not entered at the check post within 6 hours of taking the travel slip, the journey slip is canceled
 maa vaishno devi ke darshan ke liye vartmaan main jis maarg kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, vah prakritik maarg nahin he
 It was built when the number of pilgrims who came here increased significantly
 jab darshanathiyon ke sankhya kam hoti he, tab pracheen gupha kaa maarg bhi khol diya jaataa he
 Vaishno Devi cave temple is about 98 meters long
 gupha ke andar ek vrahat chabutara he, jise ‘maa kaa asana’ kaha jaataa he
 There are two more artificial routes to come here
 gupha ke ek sthaan ko ‘garbh-pujan sthaan’ yaa ‘garbhajun’ kehete hai
 Devotees believe that Vaishno Devi resided here just as the infant stays in the womb for nine months
 aaie, jaanate hai is gupha mandir or yahaan kii yatra se judi kuch rochak baaten: The place where Vaishno is enshrined in the cave as Devi Pindis, Goddess Kali (right) and Goddess Saraswati (left) and Goddess Lakshmi (middle), is called 'mata Rani ka Bhavan'
 manyata he ki yaheenpar vaishno devi ne bhaironath kaa vadh kiya tha
 Travelers have to take a travel slip to Katra to see Vaishno Devi
 yatra parchi lene ke 6 ghante ke bheetar yadi ise check post par entry nahin karavaaya jaataa he, to yatra parchi radd ho jaati he
 The path currently used to visit Maa Vaishno Devi is not a natural path
 iskaa nirmaan tab karavaaya gaya tha, jab yahaan aanevaale tirthayatriyon kii taadaad kaaphi bad gai
 When the number of visitors is less, the path of the ancient cave is also opened
 vaishno devi gupha mandir lagbhag 98 meter lambaa he
 There is a huge platform inside the cave, which is called 'mother's seat'
 yahaan aane jane ke liye do or kritrim raste bane hue hai
 One place in the cave is called 'garbha-poojan place' or 'garbhajoon'
 shraddhaluon kaa maananaa he ki jis tarah se shishu nau maas tak garbh main rahata he, usee prakaar vaishno devi ne yahaan vaas kiya tha

 pashchim bengalmen jadavapur vishvavidhyalay ke ek professor ko rajya kii mukhyamantri vatrunmul congress kii adhyaksh mamata banerjeethatha party ke kuch anya netaaon kaa apmanjanak cartoon baantne ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 a police official said that a professor named Ambikesh Mahapatra was arrested on Thursday night
 unke khilf bhartiya dand samhita or soochna praudyogiki adhinium kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The cartoon is based on Satyajit Ray's film 'sonar Kella', in which Mamta and Railway Minister Mukul Rai are shown discussing ways to deal with party MP Dinesh Trivedi
 rail bajet main kiraaya vruddhi ke baad mamata or party ke dabaav main trivedi ko rail mantri ke pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The professor's arrest has been widely criticized
 trinmul ke hi baagi saansad kabir suman ne kaha ki maine cartoon dekha he, lekin main samaj nahin paa rahaa ki yah kis prakaar sibar aparaadh he
 It is created as a satire
 yadi aaj unhen giraftaar kiya gaya he to koun jaanata he kal hamen bhi giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray has once again attacked the Modi government at the Center
 party ke mukhpatr saamana ko die saakshaatkaar main uddhav ne bijepi ke achche din ke vaade par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki achche din sirf sarkari vigyapanon main hi dikhaai de rahe hai, baaki sirf anand hi anand he
 'stay calm not in our blood' Uddhav Thackeray also strongly criticized the way GST was implemented
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah se chijen ho rahi hai wo sab gadabad he
 It is difficult to remain calm in view of this
 uddhav ne kaha philhal samajhadaari isi main he ki jo ho rahaa he use shanti se dekhte raho
 But if the legacy of Shiv Sena chief is to be maintained, it is not in our blood to remain calm
 jo kuch ho rahaa he use sirf dekhte rahanaa bhi hamase nahin hoga
 So wherever we find things that are not right there, we are keeping our thoughts firmly
 satta kaa kendriyakaran ho rahathakare ne jiesti ke bahaane hi modi sarkaar par satta ke kendriyakaran kaa aarope lagaaya
 Uddhav said that the only motive behind protesting is whether we have to centralize or decentralize everyone? If the person whose sticks are the way to rule his buffalo, then Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister, then he brought the Panchayati Raj to a lower level
 ajamodi pradhanmantri hanore us swaittata ko khatm kar sab kuch centre ke haath main rakhane kaa kaam shuru he
 Uddhav Thackeray also targeted the Modi government on demonetisation with 15 lakh unemployed GST from demonetisation
 saamana ko die intervyuu main uddhav thakare ne kaha ki chaar maheene main 15 lakh log berozegaar ho gaye
 Jobs lost, 1
5 million people who lost their jobs, is there a system of pulses and bread? Am i not anti-government? Uddhav made it clear that he should not be treated as anti-government for all these issues
 
 mujhe ek baat saaf kerani he ki jab main yaa shivasena kuch bolti he to us samay hamen sarkaar virdohi samajha jaataa he
 i am not anti-government
 main janata ke saath hum
 Uddhav also expressed concern over the ongoing tensions with China at the Sikkim border in a conversation with the Shiv Sena that will continue to play the role of watchman
 unhone saaf kaha ki shivasena beshak bijepi ke saath he lekin wo wochaman kii bhoomika nibhaati rahegi
 These days BJP leaders are competing for food for Dalits
 isi qatari main begusarai main kendriya rajya mantri eses ahaluvalia ne ek dalit ke ghar khaanaa to khaaya, lekin iske baad ve vivaadon main aa gaye
 Minister Ahluwalia has been accused that food for him was cooked from outside
 haalanki is mudde par sawaal hone par par mantri ahaluvalia bhadak uthe
 At the same time, the minister refused to eat by asking for food from outside
 in dinon bijipi netaaon kaa daliton ke ghar jaakar bhojan kaa silsilaa lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa he
 First ate the house of Keshav Prasad Maurya, Suresh Rana and Yogi Adityanath and later SS Ahluwalia Nedalit

 Costly rice, high quality pulses and vegetables made from outside belonged only to the courtyard and dalit

 At the same time, some BJP leaders are also criticizing the decision of Dalits to eat food
 bijepi saansad savitri bai phule ne ise dikhaava or bahujan samaaj kaa ‘apmaan‘ qaraar diya he
 Savitri said that the matter should be when eating the food cooked by the Dalit and washing his utensils himself
 vahiin uma bharti ne kaha tha ki ham bhagwaan ram nahin hai ki daliton ke saath bhojan karenge, to wo pavitra ho jaaenge
 When the Dalits come to our house and sit and dine together, then we will be able to become pure
 dalit ko jab main apane ghar apane haathon se khaanaa parosungi tab meraa ghar dhanya ho jayega

 partner ko kis karnaa pyaar ke izhaar kaa ek behtareen tarika he
 Although there are many ways to express love, but by which to express love is the most effective
 isse do logon ke bich kaa shaareerik bandhan to majboot hota he hi saath hi bhaavnaatmak judaav bhi badhata he
 According to experts, they also consider it a healthy way of expressing love, but at the same time it is very important to take special care of many things while kissing
 kis karne ke dauraan safai kaa dhyaan rakhana behad ahm he
 While kissing, the partner should always take care that his partner does not feel uncomfortable
 is dauraan bahut adhik uttejit ho janaa bhi galat vyavhaar he
 Apart from these habits, most loving couples make these mistakes while kissing
 par agar aap in galatiyon ko na karen to vaaki ye pal aapke liye khaas ban jayega
 1
 munh se aati ho badboo to sabase pehle ise dur karengar aap apane partner ko kis karne ja rahe hai to yah sunishchit kar len ki aapke munh se badboo nahin aa rahi ho
 If your mouth smells, do not kiss your partner even if you forget
 isse aapkaa impressant to kharaab hoga hi saath hi ye sankraman kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 You can use a mouth freshener to solve this problem
 2
 Getting too close is also not right, during which most people get very close
 ye galat tarika he
 Your partner may not like this behavior of yours
 pyaar main koi bhi kaam hadabadi main nahin kiya janaa chahie
 3
 kis karne kaa galat tarika kar saktaa he aap donon ko doorkai baar kis karne ke dauraan ek partner jarurat se zyada utawala ho jaataa he
 It is not right to do so
 aapako apane partner kii ichha or uski pasand kaa bhi puraa dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat he
 4
 kis karne ke dauraan ankhon kaa bhi hota he ahm rollpartner ko kis karne ke dauraan zyaadaatar log apni ankhen khuli rakhte hai or idhar-udhar dekhte hai
 This method is not wrong but it is also not completely correct
 aise main aapkaa puraa dhyaan apane partner par nahin rah jaataa he or ho saktaa he ki aapke is vyavhaar se aapkaa partner khud ko upekshit mahasoos kare
 5
 kis karne kaa andaaj bhi daal saktaa he rang main bhangahar baar ek hi tareeke se kis karnaa thodaa boring ho saktaa he
 You can try something new every time to impress the partner
 inhen bhi padhein:vaaki pet se hokar jaataa he dil kaa rasta
 
 
 Want to know how? After falling in love, girls change this girl, if she is a girlfriend, then marry her, why would you want to know? Give this special gift to a partner, do not do it accidentally in front of the impressor aakhir ranvir hai kya? kaam ko lekar junun se bharaa, apane luks ke saath experiment karata, naachata-kudata apane phans kaa dil bahalaata or har chalange puraa karata
 Who can match it? Ranveer got his iron once again by completing Hrithik Roshan's Bang Bang Dare

 isro ne ekaparmaanu ghadiviksit kii he jiskaa upyog sateek sthaan data ko maapne ke liye nevigation satellite main kiya jayega
 Currently, the space agency imports atomic clocks from European aerospace manufacturer Astrium for its navigation satellites
 ahmedabad sthitaspes aplicoshan centre(esaysi) ke nideshak tapan mishra ne kaha, 'esaysi ne ek swadeshi parmaanu ghadi viksit kii he or abhi ghadi par quality test ho rahe hai
 Once all these tests are successful, the home nuclear clock will be used on the experimental navigation satellite to test its accuracy and durability in space
 'esaysi nideshak ne kaha, 'desi parmaanu ghadi ke vikaas ke saath, isro duniya ke kuch antariksh sanghathanon main se ek ban gaya he jisane is behad parishkrut takanic ko viksit karne kii kshamta praapt kii he
 We do not know much about the design and technology of imported atomic clock
 lekin desi ghadi hamaare dizin or vinirdeshon ke aadhaar par viksit kii gai he
 This watch is as good as imported
 hamen aashaa he ki yah aasaani se paanch saal se adhik samay tak kaam karegaa
 'all seven navigation satellites previously launched as part of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) or Navich have three imported rubium atomic clocks
 in parmaanu ghadiyon ke kaamkaaj par tapan mishra ne kaha, 'pehle shuru kiye gaye sabhi saat upgrahon main parmaanu ghadiyon ko samakaleen (sincranaise) kiya gaya he
 The time difference between the atomic clocks of different satellites located in different orbits is used to measure the exact position of a navigation receiver or an object on Earth
 yadi parmaanu ghadi me koi khamiyaan aati he, yaa uske bich or anya ghadiyon ke bich kii gai samay antar sateek nahin he, to wo badale main object kii galat sthiti pradaan karata he
 In addition to atomic clocks, a navigation satellite also has crystal clocks but they are not as accurate as atomic clocks
 isliye, agar satellite kii teen atomic ghadi erar dikhaati he, to hame nai atomic ghadi ke saath back up satellite launch kerani hogi
 According to a reliable source at ISRO, nine of the 21 atomic clocks used in some of the seven navigation satellites launched are showing errors
 isliye, isro ne bhartiya nakshatra (NAVIC) ke saath nevigation ko prabhavi rakhane ke liye chaar byaap nevigation upgrahon ko launch karne kii yojana banaai he
 These backup satellites, which are also likely to have indigenous atomic clocks, will add buffers to homegrown GPS systems
 sorce ke anusaar, 'isro ko byaap upgrahon ke liye sarkaar se vittiya manjuuri kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 'on 12 April last month, ISRO successfully launched the naval irnss-1i to replace India's first navigation satellite IRNSS-1A, whose three nuclear clocks had stopped functioning two years earlier
 is prakaar iareneses-1 ai ne naviaisi parichaalan ko banaae rakhane ke liye antariksh main aavashyak saat kaaryaatmak nausenaon kaa nakshatra puraa kiya
 Tapan Mishra said, 'atomic clocks have complex technology
 ve vibhinn kaarnon se kaam karnaa band kar sakate hai
 It is not only an Indian navigation satellite, but the atomic clocks on the Galileo (european Union navigation satellite system) satellites have also failed earlier
 'lagbhag 12 saal pehle eneviisi ko 1,420 karod rupee kii laagat se 1,420 karod rupee kii laagat se ekaswadeshi upgrahadhaarit nevigation pranali sthapit karne ke liye bhartiya bhumigat or aasapaas ke kshetra main 1,500 kimi tak kii sthiti, nevigation or samay sevaayen pradaan karne ke liye anumodith kiya gaya tha
 Although the indigenous navigation system is much more operational, it is not as popular as American GPS in the country because receivers and mobile chipsets are not required to access the home system

 ) The murder case of an 8-year-old innocent girl gang-raped in Kathua, Jammu, will now be heard in Pathankot court
 supreme court ne aaj cese kii sunwaayee jammu evam kashmir se baahar kiye jane kii maang vaali yachika par sunwaayee karte hue yah aadesh diya
 Also, the Supreme Court has ordered the case to be heard on a daily basis, on a fast track basis and in a closed room
 supreme court ne peedit paksh kii suraksha ke maddenjar yah aadesh sunaate hue kaha ki feare or fere trial ekasaath nahin ho sakate
 The Supreme Court also said in the order that no High Court will presently hear cases related to this case
 supreme court ne sarkaar ko yah aadesh bhi diya he ki wo gavaahon ke bayaan darj karaane ke liye unhen pathankot laane le jane kaa kharj vahan karegi
 The government will also have to bear this expense in the case of the accused
 sarvocch adaalat ne sarkaar ko thodi raahat dete hue is maamle main special peepi niyukt karne kii chhot jarur di he
 Now the Supreme Court will next hear the case on 9 July
 rajya mahabuuba mufti sarkaar is cese kii sunwaayee rajya se baahar nahin chaahati thi
 The lawyers appearing in the court on behalf of the state government while praising the state police investigating the case, wanted to assure the court that they will get the victim to the Fair Trier
 lekin supreme court ne unki baat nahin maani
 The Mufti government also offered options to have the case heard elsewhere in Jammu and Kashmir
 rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki maamle kii sunwaayee rajya ke andar hi kahin or transfar kiya ja saktaa he
 The state government gave four options for transferring the hearing of the case - Jammu, Udhamsingh Nagar, Ramban and Sambha
 rajya sarkaar dwaara die gaye in vikalpon main se sambha par ek yachikakarta ne sahmati bhi jataa di he
 But the aggrieved side says that Jammu, Sambha and Udhamsingh Nagar are the hubs of miscreants, yes it would be easy to go to Jammu, 80 km from Kathua
 supreme court ne vahiin kaha ki gavaahon ko adaalat tak laana le janaa sarkaar kii zimmedaari hoti he
 Along with the Supreme Court, the petition demanding the CBI to investigate the case in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court will be dismissed
 jammu evam kashmir hoicourt main aaj is cese par sunwaayee honi thi, lekin rajya sarkaar dwaara apana paksh rakhane ke liye or samay maange jane ke baad hoicourt ne sunwaayee agle saptaah tak ke liye taal di thi
 The petition seeking a CBI probe into the Kathua case was filed by Veenu Gupta, a lawyer in the High Court
 peedita kii ore se court main pesh huin vakil ne rajya sarkaar dwaara apni pratikriya na de paane ko lekar aalochana kii
 The victim's lawyer said that this shows the seriousness of the Mufti government about the case
 saath hi vakil vinu gupta ne mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ke us taaja bayaan kii bhi aalochana kii, jisamen mufti ne kaha he ki maamle kii sibaai se jaanch karwaae jane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 He said that since the matter is pending before the court, the Chief Minister should refrain from making such a statement
 bataa den ki mahabuuba mufti ne ekbar phir maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karwaae jane kii jarurat ko nakaarte hue kaha ki agar aap rajya kii police par vishwaas nahin karte, phir rajya vishwaas karne laayak koi bachataa hi nahin
 Mufti said, "it is shameful and dangerous to question the officers of the CBI team probing the case on the basis of their religion or their region"
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aparaadh hone par uski jaanch ke liye team gathit karne ke liye ham har baar janamat nahin kara sakate

 ’ Gujarat Infantry Regiment
 pradhanmantri modi or amit shah donon samaajawaadee party kaa ghoshnaptr padhakar chaunk gaye honge
 Both the BJP may be wondering why this SPI is building a regiment in the name of his state? If you wanted to build, then you would make Gujarat Armored Regiment and Ahir Infantry Regiment! What is the game plan of Akhilesh Yadav studying in Sainik School? amit shah ne to chachaa shivpal se poocha hoga ki akhilesh kyon ahir bakhtarband regiment or gujarat infentry regiment bana rahe hai?upi jab gujarat ke modi ko piem bana saktaa he to unke rajya ke naam par regiment nahin de saktaa? upi kaa dil bada bhi to he! kahin iske virodh main gujarat main andolan na ho jaae ki aap hamaare rajya ke naam par regiment kyon bana rahe hai? kyon sena main bhejnaa chaahate hai? sab ladaai main chale jaaenge to kaarobaar koun karegaa! modi ji kii sena thik nahin he to gujarat ke naam par sena banane kii baat kaise thik he!mazaaq chhodie
 Recently, many leaders said that the people of Gujarat are not martyrs
 yah baat sahi nahin he
 In 2017, Scoop Whoop has compiled reports published in different places on it
 ritu singh ne bataaya tha ki 31 march 2017 tak gujarat main 26,656 purv sainik the
 39 soldiers from Gujarat have received bravery awards
 aatankwaad se ladate hue 20 javaanon ne balidaan diya he
 24 soldiers have martyred at the border
 kab se kab tak kaa zikr nahin he
 There are good people in the army from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Uttarakhand
 kuch rajya se nahin jate
 There is no comparison between the number of martyrs between states
 vaise upi se shaheedon kii sankhya kaa pataa nahin chal paaya
 Aakar Patel reports on Rediff that Nepal is half the size of Gujarat, he sends more troops from Gujarat to the army
 gujarat main 2009 main vishesh abhiyaan ke baad 719 sainik bhartee hue the
 Before that 230 soldiers were recruited
 sena ko hi sabhi rajyon kii suchi nikaal deni chahie
 Even of the martyrs
 isse ek laabh yah hoga ki koi madad karnaa chaahe to vah sidhe parivaar se sampark kar saktaa he
 In many places it becomes a trend to go to a particular job
 sena kaa bhi ban jaataa he
 At one time the people of Gujarat did long sea voyages and did business all over the world
 wo kam saahasik nahin rahaa hoga
 i would have got off the wooden boat to see the height of the waves! Doing business in unknown places is adventurous and adventurous
 2014 main do gujaratiyon kaa upi ke dhurandharon ko zero par pahunchaa dena bhi kam saahasik nahin tha!jis tarah se sena kaa raajnneetikaran ho rahaa he
 The doer does not care about any public consideration
 uske jawaab main to ye sab hoga
 Some would ask why does Gujarat give four lakh to the families of the martyrs of the paramilitary forces and why is UP twenty five lakh? All states should have a policy
 ek niti yah bhi ho ki sena ko lekar raajnneeti na ho
 By the way, Akhilesh Yadav should know that Modi and Shah are themselves Gujarat Infantry Regiment, UP people have to make armored regiment in response! Fire! Dh dh dh dh dha

 Significantly, there were many such reports in the media that China is building a huge military complex in Dokmala

 Prior to this, his relationship with India was sparked by China building a road in Doklam last year and deadlock persisted for several months

 < vitt mantri arun jetali apana paanchvaan or modi sarkaar kaa aakhri purna bajet pesh kar rahe hai
 The biggest question on this budget is whether the central government will work to continue the economic reforms or due to the compulsion of general elections to be held in 2019, the government treasury will turn towards the public breathtaking announcements
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke aankadon se mil rahe sanketon ko dekhen to kaha ja saktaa he ki yah bajet isliye bhi khaas rahegaa kyonki aane vaale dinon ke kendra sarkaar ke saamne khadi zyaadaatar chunautiyaan khud ba khud aasaan ho jaaengi
 The biggest relief before the Modi government is that the coming year is expected to be good according to the growth rate
 aarthik survey ke mutabik is saal jahaan vikaas dar 6 se 6
 It will be between 5 percent and 7 to 7 next year
 5 fisadi tak rah saktaa he
 The return to the global economy is giving relief to the Central Government, further improving the expectation of good growth rate
 aane vaale dinon main desh main aarthik gatividhiyaan tej hongi or nai naukariyaan bhi paidaa hongi
 Increasing employment in the country will solve the biggest challenge of the central government and the path of victory will be easy for the government in the general elections
 ise padhein: BUDGET 2018: inakam tex main raahat samet kya tex dhaanche main honge ye badlaav?aarthik maamalon ke zyaadaatar jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agle 6 se 12 maheenon ke dauraan jiesti main jari sabhi dikkatein dur ho jaaengi
 This is another major reason why the Central Government will get relief
 maujuuda samay main jis tarah jiesti se sarkaar kii kamai par asar padaa he vahiin jiesti durust ho jane ke baad uske rajasav main bada ijapha ho sakegaa
 Apart from this, the business organizations claim that the steps being taken by the central government to improve the health of sick banks will start showing their effect within a year and before the elections most of the public banks will not only correct their balance sheets but also in the country New businessmen will play an important role in giving a fast pace to the economy by giving loans
 in sabake bich kendra sarkaar ke saamne ek badi chunauti bachati he ki kisaanon kii samasya se nipatane ke liye vah kya kadam uthaati he
 On one hand, the demand for farmer loan waiver is rising across the country
 vahiin aane vaale dinon main climet change ke asar or kamjor monsoon se kisaanon kii aamadani kam hone kaa nayaa khatra khadaa he
 However, the Central Government has promised to double the income of farmers in the country by 2022
 is sthiti main maujuuda bajet sarkaar sarkaar ke liye behad ahm he
 Some experts claim that in view of the elections and with the strengthening economy, the central government should announce a big welfare scheme, on the basis of which the election journey of 2019 can be made easier for him
 ise padhein: jaane bajet 2018 kii spich kaa share bazaar par padegaa kya asar!manuphaccharing sector main emport or export main maujuuda vitt varsh kii duusari or teesri timahi ke dauraan sudhaar dekhne ko mila he
 Export growth during the third quarter of the financial year 13
 6 fisadi par rahaa jabaki emport sust hokar 13
 1 percent
 yah aankaden global trend par hai or saaf sanket de rahe hai ki notebandi or jiesti kaa kaa asar kam ho rahaa he
 Significantly, in the field of FDI, a big relief is expected for the central government
 vitt varsh 2014-15 main sarkaar ko 45 billian dollar kaa videshi nivesh mila tha
 Whereas in 2013-14 it was just 36 billion dollars
 phir 2015-16 main sarkaar ko kul 55
 Foreign investment of 46 billion dollars was received
 vitt varsh 2016-17 epadiai ke maamle main behad khaas rahaa or kul epadiai 60 billian dollar se paar nikal gaya
 This year, the central government has made significant changes in keeping FDI in many areas, after which it is expected that the next financial year may be in the name of FDI
 bada epadiai aane kii sthiti main jahaan kendra sarkaar ko rajasav main raahat milegi vahiin desh main kaarobaar kii raftaar bhi tej hogi

 unka pramukh kaam sara din sharaab pinaa, ladaai jhagada karnaa or choti choti bacchiyon kii shaadi kar dena tha
 When girls gave birth to children themselves, they used to die
 jiske chalate vahaan anaath bachche bhi kaaphi hai
 When we went there, we talked to them and explained about many things, due to which changes were also seen in them
 jin jaanwaron kaa maance wo kaccha khate the aaj unki puja karte hai
 Alcoholic trees have been uprooted
 sharaab chhod di, unke bainkon main khate hai, ab vahaan skool he jahaan wo bachche padhate hai, un anaath bacchon ke liye anathalay hai
 Now people have started understanding social methods
 is film ke jariye hamane yahi massej dene kii koshish kii he ki jab junglee log apni aadat badal sakate hai to hamaara sabhy samaaj kyon nahin ?is baar film main ection aapaki pehle relies hui film se kaaphi alag he?ji haa is baar ection kaaphi nayaa he
 Just like there is 'malla Khamb' in yoga, we have captured and destroyed the bad guy
 kai fite seen bhi is baar aajamaae hai
 Did you take acting training? Did not take acting training, but have tried to get better than before
 jin logon ne film dekhi he unka maananaa he ki pehle relies hui film se isamen behatar acting kii he
 i do not believe that we are good actors but we have a message so that the youth see it
 or un chizon ko chune, baaki antertenment to he hi
 How have you threaded the songs this time? Initially this film has songs of tribals
 phir lav story kaa geet he
 We have sung 6 songs from the film
 ek desh main badlaav laane ke liye bhi ek gaanaa gaaya he
 The first film was good, what is expected this time? The response of the trailer is tremendous, as far as the earnings are concerned, the makers know the information better
 hamane is film produs nahin kiya he
 Our aim is that we reach the people
 hamaare free satsang main logon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 Just reached the film Jana Jana
 balki is film ke mekars to teesri film banane kii taiyaari main bhi hai
 So it is clear from this that they are also benefiting through the film, the message of human goodness is reaching our people
 tisare part kaa kya subject rahegaa?kai subject chal rahe hai, unamem se ek 'vedon' par bhi aadhaarit he
 How this earth was made, just like the English 'avatar' film has come, so we will make a film based on our Vedas, how thousands of feet people used to be, there were different views, some people had water, some had water There was a volcano, there was snow on some mountains and somewhere
 unamem jivan kaise panpa, kaise aage badha
 Will try to show that era
 bharat kii taraf se vishwa ke liye kuch alag lekar aaenge
 You have made changes on your look this time too? We felt that we should change the look according to the youth, so we kept it aside
 ham koshish yah bhi kar rahe hai ki youth ke hisaab se apane aap main or bhi badlaav laaen
 Do you see movies on your own? In fact, more of our time is spent in recovering girls who indulge in drugs
 ham unase paisa bilkul nahin lete, unka rahanaa khaanaa free hota he
 They are called meditation and service
 kabhi kabhaar bete betiyaan hamen filmon ke bare main kuch naa kuch dikhte rahete hai
 Your first film was surrounded by a lot of controversies? For the first time we did not know anything, this time we have already cleared everything
 pehle relies hui film main bhi hamane kisi ko kuch galat nahin bolaa tha, naa jane kyon log virodh kar rahe the
 If you have to go to some reality show to promote the film, will you go? If there is any benefit in it, then we will definitely go
 kya us sho ke madhyam se koimasejade paaenge?agar massej dene ke laayak sho hoga to jarur jaaenge, varanaa nahin

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked the members of the bjp's core group to be alert to those who divert attention from the functioning of the government and thwart their efforts
 piem modi ne kaha he ki iske liye jaruri he ki nishpaksh logon se sampark saadhaa jaae or virodhiyon ke dushprachaar kaa pardaafash ho
 In his concluding speech to the BJP on Tuesday evening at the core group members meeting, Prime Minister Modi gave an example to explain his point
 unhone kaha ki jab aap kisi kamare main baith kar shant chitt se koi pustak pard rahe hai tab agar kamare main koi gatividhi ho to isse dhyaan bhatakta he
 In the same way, when the government is focusing its attention in the schemes of poor welfare, then the opponents try to divert the attention of the government by doing such activities one after the other
 unhone kaha ki aisi kai takatein hai, jo nahin chaahati hai ki desh aage bade or vah is tarah kii koshishon main jute hai
 PM Modi told the party leaders that now the way of contesting elections is changing
 paaramparik dhang se chunaav ladane ke din lad chuke hai

 In this episode, when the turn of Bhopal MP Sadhvi Pragya Thakur came, he expressed the apprehension of the use of lethal force on BJP leaders by the opposition on the demise of BJP leaders
 # watchpragya thakur,bjp MP: Once a Maharaj ji told me that bad times are upon us&opposition is upto something, using some 'marak shakti' against BJP

 In fact, with the party getting only five percent votes at the national level in the 2004 general elections, there is no possibility of Mayawati becoming Prime Minister on her own, so she wants others to put her on the throne
 vaise, unhone apana sapana marane nahin diya or navgathit tisare morche par dabaav daalaa ki vah unke naam par vichaar kare
 a week later, he announced to contest elections alone for the new social coalition of Dalits (21 per cent) and Muslims (18 per cent) apart from Brahmins
 unhone sochaa ki isse pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par unka samarthan karne yaa na karne ko lekar duvidha main fanse brahmanon ke vot main daraar ko nae sameekaran se puraa karne main aasaani hogi
 The Brahmins were giving signs of disenchantment this time and Bhadohi's assembly by-election gave a glimpse of it
 ab mayawati ke liye uttar pradesh ko jeetna aadhe bharat ko jeet lene jaisaa he
 Researchers from Michigan University, who are traveling to Dalit areas to study the mood of voters, Dr
 amit aajaa ke anusaar, isiilie mayawati ne is baar apane chunaav prachaar ko raashtrapati chunaav vaali style main badal diya he or ve pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par vot maang rahi hai
 But according to party insiders, some of his advisers have convinced him not to accept the bulk of Brahmins' support as pre-decided
 unhone ise aankadon ke hawaale se sabit kiya
 Even in 2007, Brahmins did not blindly vote for the BSP, hence 54 of the 87 Brahmin candidates were defeated
 is baar phir unhone ek-chauthai yani 20 tikat brahmanon ko die
 But along with the party's almighty national general secretary Satishchandra Mishra, he also engaged his Muslim loyalist Nasimuddin Siddiqui to support the Muslims
 pichley chunaavon main sirf mishra ko helicopter diya gaya tha, is baar yah siddiki ko bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 Mayawati, popularly known as Iron-woman, has always been vague but clear about political ambitions in policy matters and has never shown interest in governance
 amar singh kehete bhi hai, ''sarkaar chalaane or rajya ko barbaad karne ke liye unhone apane navratna adhikari chhod rakhe hai
 "but they don't care about it
" ve dilli kii ore antim kooch kii taiyaari main vyast raheen
 He announced to field 500 candidates more than the BJP and Congress across the country and aimed to win twice the number of seats in Uttar Pradesh as compared to 2004
 tab basapa 19 siten praapt kar pai thi
 Election data experts are still confused and seem to predict his victory
 par itihaas or aankade unke samarthan main hai
 Mayawati said, in 1984, while the Pandits made the bsp's horoscope that it would not be able to run as a political party, it has contested more than 200 seats since the 1991 general elections and has 1 vote across the country
 80 fisadi se badhkar pichley aam chunaav main 5
 33 percent
 1996 main to party ne 11
 21 per cent of the votes were received, on which the Election Commission declared him a national party and allotted him a permanent elephant symbol
 mayawati kii party ke ek vichaarak sudhir goyal bataate hai, ''pehle bhi hamaari party ko nuksaan pahunchane ke virodhiyon ke prayaas vifal rahe hai
 Reason: Even though our mps, mlas were bought, the vote base of the party increased
 '' maujuuda mizaaj ko goyal ne is tukbandi ke rup main pesh kiyah congress-bhaajapa ast / samaajawaadee party post / maaya kaa hathi mast
 However, the road to Delhi has not been easy for Mayawati, who has recently been described as a hard-working political ascension by a prominent sociologist
 chunki na to koi gaiyr-bhaajapa yaa gaiyr-congressi gathbandhan unhen oonchi kursi laayak apane ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karne ko taiyaar he or na hi rescorse ke bangale ko hathiyaane kii daud main uttar pradesh ke bheetar-baahar ke matadaataaon ne manmohan singh or laalkrishna adwani ke mukaable unhen apana ummidavaar maanane kaa sanket diya he, so ho saktaa he antat ve mukhyamantri hi bani rah jaaen
 khubi-bsp voted 1 in 1991
 80 fisadi se badhaakar 2004 main jis tarah 5
 With 33 per cent tax, Mayawati's hopes are high

 Congress has not been given a place in this alliance, but Chaudhary Ajit Singh's party RLD has also not been given special consideration

 These include Baghpat, Mathura, Kairana, Hathras, Muzaffarnagar and Amroha seats
 sutron ke mutabik sapa-basapa gathbandhan areldi ko bagpat or mujffarnagar siten dena chahta he
 In this, Chaudhary Ajit Singh from Muzaffarnagar and his son Jayant Chaudhary from Baghpat seat can contest
 kya he pech?mujffarnagar or bagpat ke alaava bhi sapa-basapa do siten areldi ke dena chaahati he, lekin wo siten sidhe taur par unki nahin hongi
 The SP-BSP alliance has agreed to give RLD two seats under the Kairana model
 iske mutabik areldi ke ummidavaaron ko sapa or basapa ke chunaav chinh par chunavi maidan main utarana hoga
 In a way, officially he will be the candidate of SP and BSP
