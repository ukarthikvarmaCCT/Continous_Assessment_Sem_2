 ho saktaa he ki yah baat kuch logon ko ahm na lage, lekin mujhe to atapata-sa laga, jab kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne loksabhaa main desh ke alpsankhyakon ko is baat ke liye badhai di ki ‘unhone aatanki sanghathan iesas kii jaden is dharti par jamane nahin deen, saath hi apane bacchon ko isko lekar hatotsahit kiya’
 It would have been nice if the Home Minister would have given this congratulation to the entire countrymen
 sirf ek khaas dharm ke logon ko hi badhai kyon? kya sirf isi dharm ke log aatanki sanghathanon main shaamil hote hai? duusare dharm ke log kya puri tarah se paak-saaf hai? kahin aisa to nahin ki grahamantri desh ke bade tabake kii dharna ko hi majboot kar rahe hai ki aatank kaa rishta ek khaas majahab se he? aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki grahamantri kii manshaa yah nahin rahi ho par shabdon ke chayan main to jarur unhen saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 Badruddin Ajmal, a member of Parliament from Dhubri in Assam, says that the Home Minister should not have said that
 isse to saaf lagata he aap is samudaay ko alag chashme se dekh rahe hai
 At some point, this belief also gives rise to the belief that only minority is responsible for terrorism
 upie sarkaar kii soch bhi kuch aisi hi thi
 It is a different matter that in order to please a particular community, its leaders have made such statements and such acts many times that even mentioning them is not appropriate here
 modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad jab bhi kisi ne alpsankhyakon ke kalyaan or vikaas ke bare main sarkaar se poocha he to aksar yahi jawaab miltaa he ki hamaari sarkaar kaa mul mantra he ‘sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas’
 We will not discriminate anyone on the basis of religion and class
 phir aisi kya jarurat aan padi ki grahamantri ne is lahaze main alpsankhyakon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa padaa? purv kendriya mantri sultan ahamed jaise netaaon ko bhi grahamantri kaa yah bayaan hajam nahin ho rahaa he
 He says that this statement suggests that minorities are different from the rest of the country
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari str par bahusankhyak or alpsankhyakon ke bich bhedbhaav kaa yah koi pehla maamla he
 Governments have been discriminating in their statements, activities and behavior in the past, but after the coming of the Modi government, sometimes love jihad, sometimes there are controversies like conversion and sometimes the loud words of the sadhvi and sadhu-clad leaders
 i have already become afraid
 haalanki purv grih sachiv or ab saansad aarake singh grahamantri kaa bachaav karte hue kehete he ki samaaj kaa yahi tabaka iesas jaise sanghathanon ke zyada nishane par yahi he isliye is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi grahamantri ne apni baat rakhi
 According to the constitution and due to religious-social harmony, the reason of the time is that such controversial statements should be avoided, at least at the government level
 ab yadi sarkarein bhi kattarwadi sanghathanon kii soch ko hawa dene lagegi to isse alpsankhyakon main asuraksha kaa bhay utpann hona lajimi he
 Especially when the history of the Prime Minister to many ministers and the government's guiding organizations is not clear about such discrimination, then more caution is needed, because the issue is not within the country, but many countries It may also have an indirect or indirect impact on international diplomatic relations with
 acha ho ki sarkaar aise bayanon se bachane kaa prayaas kare
 There should not be any feeling like being isolated in the minds of the minorities, such an attempt should be made at all levels from the government level, otherwise small incidents are such that they are unable to get out of it and know- Unknowingly society and country become part of anti-elements / organizations / thinking and activities

 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP, now Amit Shah has unquestionably established himself as the Janata
 yah baat maharashtra or haryana ke vidhansabha chunaav main amit shah kii reliyon se sabit hoti he
 He is credited as the Home Minister for the decision to abolish Article 370
 yahi kaaran he ki in donon rajyon main janata ke bich amit shah behad lokapriy netaa ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aae
 In public meetings, Shah was described as the 'lion of India'
 maharashtra or haryana main kendriya netaaon main piem modi ke baad sabase zyada unheen kii maang rahi
 Modi and Shah searched both the states according to the number of rallies
 ve kone-kone tak gaye or in rajyon main satta kii vaapasi main koi kasar nahin chodi
 It is the effect of big decisions taken in his short tenure as Home Minister that Shah has emerged as the star campaigner of the BJP
 abhi tak ve bataur bijepi adhyaksh in rajyon main chunaav prachaar karte aae the
 But after taking over as Home Minister in May, a new form of his political personality has emerged
 jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 or dhara 35 e ko samaapt karnaa, jammu-kashmir or ladakh ko alag kar centre shasit pradesh bananaa, rajya ke rajanetaaon ko band karnaa tathaa janata par lagaai gai paabandiyon ke chalate ve lagaataar surkhiyaan bator rahe hai
 In the assembly elections of both these states, BJP made the abolition of Article 370 a major electoral issue
 haryana vidhansabha chunaav main amit shah ne 8 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya he jabaki pradhanmantri modi ne saat
 If compared to the Lok Sabha elections held this year, then Shah addressed six rallies and PM Modi addressed three rallies in the state
 isi tarah maharashtra kii baat karen to vahaan par chunaav prachaar samaapt hone tak piem modi ko 10 reliyon ko sambodhit kar chuke honge to vahiin shah 18 reliyon ko
 Shah is exerting power in western Maharashtra, which is considered a stronghold of the congress-ncp
 agar pichley vidhansabha chunaav kii baat karen to tab piem modi ne 27 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya tha or shah ne 30 se bhi zyada
 At that time, the BJP had decided to contest the elections alone by breaking alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and it was Amit Shah's decision
 is lihaaj se tab unhone zyada takat lagaai thi
 Then Shah was camping in Mumbai
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki is baar chunki lakshya satta hasil karnaa nahin, balki satta banaae rakhana he isliye modi-shah pichhali baar kii tulana main kam reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 Amit Shah's growing stature is also pointing to the consensus within the party that it is believed that Prime Minister Modi is responsible for the big decisions related to domestic and government by keeping the responsibility of the government's big decisions and international relations
 Giving it to Shah
 yah tab he ki jab shah pehali baar chun kar loksabhaa pahunche hai
 Prior to working in government, he had experience of Gujarat government where he used to work with Modi as the Minister of State for Home while being the Chief Minister
 shah ko kai mahatvurna antarmantralay samitiyon kii kaman saunpi gai he
 The task of disinvestment of Air India has also been given to the committee constituted under his chairmanship
 varisht netaa arun jetali kii lambii beemaari or nidhan ke baad piem modi ne amit shah ko adhik jimmedaariyaan di hai
 Many cabinet ministers are regularly seen in North Block to meet Shah to discuss decisions related to the functioning of their ministries
 shah ke badhate kad kaa andaaza is baat se bhi ho jaataa he ki bijepi main ‘ek vyakti-ek pad' kaa niyam hone ke baavjood ve grih mantri or party adhyaksh donon padon par hai kyonki yah mana gaya ki maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana ke vidhansabha chunaav hone tak unhen is pad par rakhaa jaae
 Jagat Prakash Nadda has been given the responsibility of day-to-day work of the organization by making him the executive chairman
 anya badi khabaren : Former AIIMS CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi, who exposed several cases of corruption in the country's largest government hospital, has accused the Council of Appointment, or SCC, of transferring and appointing administrative officials
 is cameti ke adhyaksh khud pradhanmantri hote hai
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi has given an affidavit in the court CAT hearing the case of the administrative officials that he has been sided with
 unhone halafname main kam se kam 14 maamalon kaa zikr kiya he jisamen centre sarkaar ne niyamon main dheel dekar kai afasaron ke tabadale mahaz 2 se 4 maheene ke bheetar kar diye
 Chaturvedi, a 2002-batch IFS officer, had sought to change his cadre from Haryana to Uttarakhand in 2012 but the ACC asked him to re-process the entire process at the last moment
 pradhanmantri kii adyakshata vaali is cameti ne chaturvedi ke uttarakhand tabadale kii prakriya ye kah kar roak di ki haryana or uttarakhand se ek baar phir se no objection yani enosi liya jaye
 After this, Chaturvedi filed a case in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), the court hearing the plea of government officials
 In his affidavit, Chaturvedi has said that the Modi government has ignored the rules in the case of more than a dozen cadre deputations in the last 10 months
 
 cat pehle hi chaturvedi kii shikaayat kaa sangyaan lete huye cabinet cameti of appointment ke adeshon par pehle hi ste laga chuki he
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi was the target of the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government after exposing several corruption cases in Haryana and termed his life as a threat there
 ames main sivio ke taur par unhone kai maamle khole or bade adhikariyon se unki nahin bani
 The current Health Minister JP Nadda wrote a letter to the then Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to remove him, after which a lot of controversy arose
 ames main satr bataate hai ki centre sarkaar ne chaturvedi ko sidline kiya hua he or abhi unke paas koi kaam nahin he
 It is believed that the angry government is blocking his transfer due to his reckless attitude
 gauratlab he ki chaturvedi ko dilli sarkaar ne mukhyamantri kejariwal ke oesady ke taur par maanga tha lekin centre sarkaar ne unki file roak kar rakhi hui he jabaki kai duusare afasar kejariwal kii maang par relive kar diye gayi hai
 In this regard, environment minister Javadekar on Tuesday deferred the questions and said that he could not give any eye-sight to the movement of the file

 mahavikas aghadi ne congress netaa naanaa patole ko spikar jaisaa ahm pad dekar vidarbha ilaake ke saath-saath obisi samudaay ko bhi saadhane kii koshish kii he
 Patole is identified as a farmer leader and is considered a keen sportswoman in politics
 spikar pad ke liye bijepi ne kishan cathore ko apana pratyaashee banaaya tha
 However, in keeping with the Assembly's tradition, the opposition withdrew its candidate and defied the government's hurdles to carry on the tradition of electing an unopposed speaker
 patole ko modi virdohi ke taur par pahchaan mili, saath hi vah kisaan netaa hai or vidarbha kii jameen se taalluk rakhte hai
 This has been the main reason for his becoming a speaker
 kisaanon ko sandeshnana patole philhal sacoli vidhansabha seat se congress ke vidhayak hai lekin 2014 main unhone bijepi kii tikat par loksabhaa chunaav jeeta tha
 Vidarbha region has a great influence in Maharashtra and the problems of farmers there become a matter of discussion all over the country
 aise main usee vidarbha se kisi kisaan netaa ko spikar kaa pad dekar mahavikas aghadi or congress party ne kisaanon ko sandesh dene kii koshish kii he
 In the midst of elections, all the leaders had to go to Vidarbha to know the condition of the farmers and with the formation of the government, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had talked about waiving the debt of farmers
 apane pehali press vaarta main thakare ne kaha tha ki kisaanon ko hue nuksaan kaa akalan karne ko kaha gaya he or aankade aate hi bada elaan kiya jayega
 Nana Patole went to the Speaker election unopposed after BJP withdrew its Speaker's candidature in the Assembly
 unke nirvachan par sadan main siem uddhav ne kaha ki naanaa patole kisaan parivaar se aate hai, isliye mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ve sabhi ko nyaay dilaayenge
 Patole is the national president of the Kisan Congress and in such a situation the party wants to indicate the country to be farmer friendly
 mahavikas aghadi sarkaar kii bhi manshaa he ki vidhansabha main patole ko kisaanon ke pratinidhi ke taur par prastut kiya jaae jisase rajyabar ke kisaanon ko yah bharosa jataayaa jaae ki sarkaar unki samasyaon ko lekar sajag he
 Aziz Congress MLA from every party Nana Patole has also previously lived in BJP and Shiv Sena
 aise main sarkaar main shaamil shivasena or congress ke liye to unki sweekaaryata zyada he hi saath main vipakshi dal bijepi ke netaaon se bhi unke sambandh behatar maane jate hai
 In 2014, Patole contested on a BJP ticket and defeated NCP veteran Praful Patel
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne ke baad patole ne bijepi kaa daaman chhod phir se congress kaa haath tham liya
 Patole has also previously served in the Shiv Sena and in 2009, he resigned from the Congress on the issue of development of farmers and Vidarbha
 iske baad wo nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav lade or doosraa sthaan hasil kiya
 In this election, Praful Patel of NCP won
 bijepi main rahete modi kii aalochananana patole 2014 main bijepi kii tikat par chunaav jite lekin baad main unhone party par kisaan virdohi hone kaa aarope laga tha
 Three years after the first term of the Modi government, Patole started targeting Prime Minister Modi
 patole ne nagpur main hue ek kaarykram main aarope lagaaya tha ki piem modi kisi kii bhi baat nahin sunate or party baithak main piem ne unhen us vakt apni baat nahin rakhane di thi, jab wo kisaanon kaa mudda uthaa rahe the

 Air India pilots deferred the strike on November 24 for 6 days in protest against proposals to cut salary and allowances

" unhone or samay kii bhi maang kii or mukhya shram ayukta ke aagrah par hamane 30 november tak ke liye hadtaal taal di
 Singh said that the management made a "vague proposal" to address our demands, so the conversation failed

 The matter of election of BCCI President is currently in the news

 He is arguing that the court has not stopped him from contesting elections
 is bare main 14 farvari ko hi pataa chal paaegaa ki adaalat kaa rukh kya he
 Apparently if the court said negative things, the doors would be closed for Srinivasan
 lekin jo log soch rahe hai ki uske baad cricket board main safai ho jaaegi yaa vahaan phir se sushasan ho jayega wo galatfahami main hai kyonki raajnneeti ke shaatir khilaadi or purv mantrisharad pavaar ne us ore nazren gada dihain
 Pawar has tasted the strength and prosperity of the BCCI and served as its President from 2005 to 2008

 iske liye unhen purvi kshetra ke samarthan kii jarurat he, jahaan shrinivasana abhi majboot sthiti main hai
 It is surprising that Bihar Cricket Association secretary Aditya Verma, who brought the IPL fixing scam before the country and the court, urged Pawar to contest
 verma kaa daawa tha ki unhone bisisiai main safai kaa abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa he or vahaan se bhrashtachar mitaakar rahenge
 But now he is urging Sharad Pawar to sit there
 pavaar mumbai cricket association ke adhyaksh hai or unki nigahen duniya ke is sabase amir khel sanghathan par he
 The whole country knows how and what Sharad Pawar did as the Chief Minister of UPA Government and Maharashtra
 un par bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope hameshaa lage, lekin raajnneeti ke is chatur khilaadi ne apane pratidwandviyon ko kabhi apane par hamalaa nahin karne diya
 They threw all their leaves wisely
 ab vah phir dhire-dhire is malaaidaar pad par aane kii taiyaari main hai
 This is not a good message for Indian cricket
 75 saal ke pavaar jod-tod ke betaj badshaah rahe hai or iske boote hi 1990 main 12 nirdaleeyon kii madad se maharashtra ke siem pad par kabiz ho gaye the
 This is the same Pawar against whom Anna Hazare went on hunger strike

 Counsel for Delhi Government, from Judge NV Raman and Justice Rajiv Sahai, said that admission in nursery would not begin until the court action committee would pass an order on the petition of unaccredited recognized private schools
 buudhvaar ko maamle main teen ghante se adhik samay tak daleel chali
 During this time, the government claimed that the nursery admission guidelines issued by the Lt

 On the eve of the first Test match with India at the Eden Gardens Stadium since Wednesday, visiting team captain Darren Sammy said that his bowlers would not focus on any one player

 However, the captain said that his bowlers will have to work hard to get wickets in Eden
 saimi bole, ‘bhartiya ballebaaj acha khel rahe hai
 This series will be very difficult for our bowlers, but in spite of that we will try to win the match with 20 wickets with the right strategy

 This donkey named 'tipu' is not like that but is considered to be the 'most expensive donkey' in the country so far
 kya he is 'tippu' kii khaasiyat, aaie jaanate hai isi ke maalik raaj singh se
 Raj Singh, 40, living in Nayabas, Sonepat, has charged Rs 10 lakh to sell 'tipu'
 raaj singh kaa daawa he ki unke paas 5 lakh rupye main 'tippu' ko kharidne kii peshkash aa bhi chuki he
 Raj Singh, engaged in the business of breeding, said, 'tippu is not a minor donkey
 ye saadhaaran gadhon ke kad se saat inch lanbaa he
 It is used for breeding
 rohtak ke beri pashu meley main uttar pradesh ke ek breader ne ise kharidne ke liye 5 lakh rupye kii boli lagaai thi lekin maine bechney se manaa kar diya
 It is the most different and the biggest, so i will not sell it for less than 10 lakhs
 ''tippu' sabase alag he isliye uske nakhre uthaane main bhi koi kasar nahin chodi jaati
 Which Shahana is living with 'tipu', it can be estimated from its dose only
 ye har din 5 kilogram kaale chane, 4 litre doodh or 20 kilo haraa chaara hajam kar jaataa he
 After eating sweets, 'tipu' needs laddus or else its mood gets spoiled
 'tippu' par ek din kaa kharch 1000 rupye baithta he
 Apart from this, Janab also has a habit of walking in the morning and evening
 majaal he jo 'tippu' ke is routine main koi khalal aa jaae

 Earlier his father Dharam Singh was in this profession for five decades, who died last month
 raaj singh ne bataaya ki unka parivaar pehle bhi teen se saadhe teen lakh kii keemat main gadhe bech chukaa he
 a farmer from Baghpat bought a donkey for three and a half lakh rupees and sold it for 5 lakh rupees

 You will remember that 3 years ago when the Aam Aadmi Party government was formed in Delhi, then Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and i came to take your blessings 
 hamane aapse kaha tha ki agar aapkaa sahyog or aashirwad milegaa to ham or aap milakar aane vaale kuch varshon main dilli ko duniya ke sabase achche shaharon main le aaenge, maine vishesh rup se aapse kaha tha ki desh ko lekar aap jo sapane dekh rahe hai, jaise ki skill india, digital india, svachh bharat, beti bachaao beti padhaao aadi
 With your cooperation and with our dedication and hard work, we will show the truth in Delhi in such a way that you too will feel proud

 Today there are many excellent schools and institutes of education in our country
 lekin samasya yah he ki acchhee shiksha mushkil se sirf 5 pratishat bacchon ke liye hi uplabdh he
 Education conditions of the remaining 95 percent of the children are very bad, there is no minimum scale
 dilli ke sarkari skulon main aane vaale adhiktar bachche isi 95 pratishat aabaadi se aate hai
 They are poor, most of the parents did not go to school, work hard and work hard to drive home
 isamen bhi zyada mushkil ladakiyon ko hoti he
 3
 maine dekha he ki thodaa bhi saadhan uplabdh hone par kai mata-pita apane bete ko to privet skool main bhejte hai par beti ko paise kii kami ke kaaran sarkari skool main muft shiksha dilaane kaa faisla karte hai
 Providing the best education in government school for the sons and daughters of these families is true patriotism for us
 hamaare liye sahi myne main yahi vikaas he
 Working on this vision, we have maintained about 25 percent of the total budget on education in Delhi for the last 3 consecutive years
 4
 With this budget, we have built thousands of magnificent classrooms in government schools, got their buildings fixed
 saaf-safai kii acchhee vyavastha kii he
 Teachers have been sent to countries like Finland, America, Russia, UK and Singapore for national and international level training
 jo bachche apni kitaaben bhi thik se nahin pard pate, unke liye chunauti, mishan buniyaad jaise safal kaarykram yojit kiye hai
 To create a learning environment in schools, a mentor teacher program has been started
 mata-pita kii bhoomika or badhaane ke liye lagaataar mega-pitim yojit kii he
 We have made fundamental changes in the way of teaching and taking examinations, recently started 5 Schools of Excellence in Delhi, which is a model of the facilities and level of education that children of poor people can get in a government school

 Four days ago you suddenly dismissed my mentor Atishi Marlina
 aatishi marlina wo salaahkaar hai jisaki madad se hamane uparokt sabhi prayaason ke bare main sochaa, unhen amal main laae or unhen safaltaapurvak lagu kar paae
 Atishi Marlina herself has been the topper of St
 Stephen's College, Delhi
 uske baad unhone oxford vishvavidhyalay se ajukeshan main masters kii padhai kii, ve antarrashtriya khyaati praapt road-skalaruship or shaivaning-scolership praapt kar chuki hai
 She also worked as a teacher at the country's most prestigious Rishi Valley School, for the last 3 years she was working with me as an advisor to the Minister of Education
 iske evaj main ve maatr ek rupee kaa vetan leti thi
 What message do you want to give by dismissing such dedicated country devotees and educated talented women from the fundamental work of education of the children of Delhi? 6
 In our country, none of the Education Ministers, Education Secretaries or Education Directors are required to be education experts or education experts in the decision making, planning and implementation of education system
 meri raay main desh bhar main sarkari skool system ke doobane kaa ek bada kaaran yahi he
 We have hired a well educated and experienced woman like Atishi Marlina as education consultant in Delhi government
 iske nattejey bhi saamne aae
 Today even our most staunch opponents in the whole country believe that the Delhi government has done a great job in education in 3 years and the government schools have started to turn around
 7
 i wonder what you want to gain from the manner in which your government issued an order to remove Atishi Marlina from the advisor to the Education Minister of Delhi? You may have political opposition from us but not the children of Delhi
 dilli ke bachche bhi isi desh ke bachche hai aap jab apane aap ko deshbhakt kehete hai to dilli ke bacchon ke bina aapaki desh bhakthi kaise puri ho sakati he? raajnneetik virodh ke kaaran unki shiksha kii behatari main lage logon ko hataanaa koun-si desh bhakthi he?8
 You never leave any stone unturned in adopting a policy of equal punishment for defeating your political opponents
 aap abhi desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 You have the power and the intoxication of power
 is nashe ke dam par aap satta kii takat kaa istemaal karke desh main koi bhi acha kaam rukva sakate hai
 But think that one day we all have to go in front of God and he has to answer that when you could get good education to the children of the country using the power, then why did you stand as a hindrance in the development of education? i am the second Minister of Education of two thirds of the state
 mainen tamaam adchanon ke baavjood dilli main 8 hajaar shandaar nae class room banaavaaye hai
 Your greatness would have happened if you had built 2 lakh new class rooms in the whole country
 maine dilli main 14 nae college khulwaaye hai
 Your greatness would have happened when 14 thousand new colleges were opened across the country
 9
 i invite you to visit Delhi's government schools with me any day to see the schools in Delhi
 main aapako dikhaanaa chahta hum ki achche skool banavaane se desh ke bacchon ke chehron par kitni khushi jhalkati he
 i want to show you what changes we have made in the education of Delhi
 raashtrapati pad par rahete hue tatkaaleen raashtrapati pranab mukherjee mere nimantran par do baar dilli ke sarkari skulon main aa chuke hai or mere anurodh par unhone sarkari skulon main itihaas kii class kii padhai bhi karai
 i also invite you to come to Delhi's government schools and colleges with an open mind and then build many such schools across the country
 10
 Mr
 Prime Minister! i request you to draw a big line in front of the line and make it big
 saamne vaale ko sam-daam-dand-bhed se mitaane se aap bad nahin ban sakate
 By removing Atishi Marlina from Advisor to the Education Minister of Delhi, you tried to erase the future of Delhi's children, not me

 kehane ko 13 april ek taarikh bhar he, lekin yah din british hukumat ke atyaacharon kii aisi dardanaak kahani bayaan karata he, jisase maanavtaa sharmasaar ho jaae
 On this day in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, the white rulers killed about two thousand Indians
 baat 1919 ke un dinon kii he, jab british hukumat ke khilaaf swatantraaa kii ladaai joro par thi or sarkaar ne aazaadee ke matavaalon kii aawaaj dabaane ke liye rolat act naam kaa kaala kanoon banaaya tha
 Under this law, anyone could be arrested without registering a case
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main bhartiya bhashaa centre ke purv adhyaksh or swatantraaa sangram par kai pustaken likh chuke professor chaman laal ke anusaar rolat act kaa puure bharat main vyapak virodh hua or prantiy parishadon ke kai bhartiya sadasyon ne iske virodh main apane padon se istipha de diya
 According to him when the government popular leader Dr
 satyapal or safuddin kichalu ko giraftaar kar liya, to deshbhar main asantosh or bhi adhik bhadak gaya
 a peaceful meeting was held at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on Baisakhi on April 13, 1919 to protest against these arrests and the Rollout Act
 sabha ko vifal karne ke liye hukumat ne tarah-tarah ke hatkande apanaae
 Mahatma Gandhi, coming to Amritsar from Mumbai to attend the meeting, was arrested at Palwal railway station
 hukumat kii cargujariyon se gussaye log hajaaron kii sankhya main 13 april, 1919 ko amritsar ke jaliyanvaala baag pahunch gaye
 Stung by this gathering, the then Governor of Punjab, Michael Odwire, ordered Brigadier General Reginald Dyer to teach the Indians a lesson
 is par general diar ne 90 sainikon ko lekar jaliyanvaala baag ko gher liya or jaise hi sabha shuru hui mashniganon se andhadhundh golibari shuru kar di gai
 They kept firing on unarmed people for about 10 minutes
 unki bandooken tab tak khamosh nahin hui, jab tak ki unki goliyaan khatm nahin ho gayi
 The garden was surrounded by high-rise walls on three sides and people could not even escape because there was only one way to go
 jaan bachaane ke liye bahut se logon ne park main maujuud kuen main chalaang laga di, lekin ve bhi nahin bache or pani main doobane se unki maut ho gai
 Many died in the stampede
 baag main lagi pattica par likhaa he ki 120 shav to sirf kuen se hi mili
 Government figures put the death toll at 379, while according to Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya at least 1300 people were killed
 swami shraddhanand ke mutabik marane waalon kii sankhya 1500 se adhik thi
 According to the then Civil Surgeon of Amritsar, this figure of death was more than 1800
 is ghatana kii duniyabar main ninda hui, lekin general diar ne kaha ki logon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye yah jaruri tha
 a British newspaper called it the most brutal massacre in modern history
 diar ne aazaadee ke diwaanon kii jaan to le lee, lekin is narsanhaar ke baad logon kaa aazaadee paane kaa jajba or bhi buland ho gaya
 Freedom lovers filled such a fire that they started jumping into the Havan Kund of freedom, regardless of their lives
 ghatana se gussaye udham singh ne kasam khai ki ve maaikel odwair ko markar is ghatana kaa badla lenge
 On 13 March 1940, his pledge was fulfilled and he gunned down Odwire at Caxton Hall, London
 vahiin duusari ore general diar kai tarah kii bimariyon se tadap-tadapakar mar gaya
 There are still bullet marks on the walls of Jallianwala Bagh, which appear to tell the story of the oppression of the British rule
 (13 april ko jaliyanvaala baag narsanhaar par vishesh) RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari has accused Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan of fooling the upper castes in the name of reservation
 unhone kaha ki narsingh raav kii sarkaar ne aarthik rup se garibon ke liye 10 pratishat aarakshan kaa kaanoon banaaya tha jisko 1992 main sarvocch nyaayalay ne amaanya kar diya tha
 Shivanand Tiwari said that Atal ji's government had also formed a committee to consider this issue
 lekin uskaa koi nishkarsh nahin niklaa
 Actually our constitution considers social and educational backwardness as the basis of reservation
 iske alaava jin jatiyon ko aarakshan dena he unka unki aabaadi ke anupaat main sarkari naukariyon main kitna pratinidhitiv he, yah bhi dekha jaataa he
 RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari issued a statement in Patna saying that the representation of upper castes in government jobs is more than the proportion of their population
 in sabhi tathyon se ramvilas paswan vaaqif hai
 Still, the Savarnas are trying to make them stupid by saying reservation
 savarnon ke bich bhi garibi or berojgaare kii samasya atyant gambhir he
 But they have to understand that the solution of unemployment is not going to happen through reservation
 argedy netaa ne kaha ki desh main kul sarkari naukari dedh karod ke aasapaas hai
 Which are about one and a half percent of our population
 phir aarakshan paane vaali jatiyon ke naujavaanon main berojgaare or garibi kii vyapak samasya he
 Therefore, it has to be understood that the treatment of unemployment and poverty is not reservation
 yah samajhnaa chahie ki aarakshan paane vaali jatiyaan desh kii aabaadi kii 75 pratishat ke lagbhag hai
 But the maximum reservation limit for them is 49
 5 pratishat he
 While the general castes constitute 15 percent of the population
 lekin unke liye apratyaksh rup se 50
 There is 5 reservations
 tiwari ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisale ke mutabiq arakshit shrenee ke ummidavaar bhale hi saamaanya shrenee ke ummidavaar se zyaada ank laate hon, unki ginati arakshit shrenee main hi hogi
 Therefore, opposition to reservation cannot be justified on any basis
 balki yah samaaj main nae tarah kaa takaraav paidaa karegaa
 Therefore, the youth of the country should rise above caste and religion and fight against unemployment
 naaraa laganaa chahie ki desh ke vikaas kii kasuti kaa aadhaar jidipi nahin balki rojgaar kaa srijan ho
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has been continuously raising the issue of giving reservation to the upper castes on economic grounds

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator On the petition seeking registration of an FIR against former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and BSP supremo Mayawati, the Tis Hazari court of Delhi has asked the petitioner to apply to the DM of the area

 Petitioner Chhatar Singh Rachhoya said, 'mayawati has compared herself to God by filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 lihaaja court police ko mayawati ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne kaa nirdesh de
 However, instead of doing anything on this application, the petitioner has directed the petitioner to contact the DM of the area
 saath hi maamle kii sunwaayee ko taal diya he
 The court told the petitioner Chhatar Singh Rachhoya, 'in the case, you should apply to the DM of your area, allowing the state or central government to run the case
 court ke mutabik cese chalaane ke liye rajya sarkaar or centre sarkaar donon main se kisi ek se ijaajat leni jaruri he
 Now on 31 July, the court will next hear the case

 Parliament is stalling for the sixth consecutive day due to bjp's uproar over the alleged scam in allocation of coal blocks
 piem se istife kii maang kar rahi bijepi mukhar he
 But now the Congress is also not ready to sit up
 somvaar ko piem ne khamoshi todi to mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi apane netaaon ko akraman karne kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 The call of Sonia's attack in the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting is the complete opposite of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's poignant reply
 sonia gandhi samaj gayi ki ab baikfoot par khilne se koi phayda nahin
 Coming to the front foot, he blamed the BJP for blackmailing
 sirf sansad main nahin sonia ab is siyaasi sangram ko sadak tak le janaa chaahati hai
 Lok Sabha elections are to be held in 2014, Sonia has given a decree that the leaders should take to the streets and answer the allegations of BJP
 sonia ne bijepi par hallaa bolaa to bijepi ne bhi tevar aakraamak kar liye
 The BJP has made it clear that it will not back down even a little with the demand of pm's resignation
 koyala par sansad main koharaam ke baad ab congress or bijepi kii ladaai sadakon par aa gai he
 If Congress President Sonia Gandhi accused the BJP of blackmailing, the BJP did not delay in retaliation
 bijepi ne sonia ke is apil kii bhi dhajjiyaan uda deen jisamen unhone apane netaaon se aakraamak hone or sadakon par utarane kii apil kii thi
 In the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, the party made it clear that going public, it will conduct a nationwide protest against corruption issues
 isi kadi main mangalvaar ko bijepi ne kuch dastavejon ke jariye congress par hamalaa bolaa
 It is another matter that Congress leaders are also putting BJP in the dock in coal block allocation
 jahaan ek taraf jaahir he sarkaar ko sankat se nikaalane ke liye sonia ne ab kaman apane haath main le lee he
 In this connection, he also spoke to the socialist supremo Mulayam Singh within the Lok Sabha before the commencement of the proceedings of Parliament
 sansad ke monsoon satr main ye doosraa mauka he jab sarkaar ko sankat se bachaane ke liye sonia ne akraman kaa aahvaan kiya he
 The first glimpses of Sonia's reprimand were first seen on 8 August, when senior BJP leader LK Advani opened his front against himself
 unke aakraamak tevar ko dekhte hi duusare congressi saansadon ne bhi hamalavar tevar apana liye the
 But, the question arises that what will the country get from this war and counterattack? The debate that should be held in Parliament, why should it be outside Parliament? Parliament proceedings run with public money? In such a situation, who is doing blackmail by stopping the proceedings? BJP has also responded to the sharp response of Congress on Sushma Swaraj's statement of fat goods
 bhaajapa ke haathon lag gai he 5 farvari 2008 kii wo chitthee jisamen centre sarkaar main mantri subodhakant sahay ne piemo main sifarish karke apane bhai ko kol block aavantit karavaaya tha
 Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to PM and recommended allocation of coal block to SKS Ispat Limited
 piemo ne bhi bina deree kiye 6 farvari ko koyala mantralay ko ye sifarish badha di
 The next day SKS Ispat Ltd
 was allotted a coal block
 congress aaropon se ghiri he or bijepi jaraa bhi narmi ke mood main nahin
 But, if not ironically, what else should be debated in Parliament
 us masale par tivi camaron ke aage sangram ho rahaa he
 Can not our honorable MP leave the battle of ego and settle the issue at the negotiating table? Are they not sacrificing the public interest in this checkmate game? If the answer is to be given to the BJP, then the government too cannot avoid this question
 kyonki sarkaar bijepi ke aaropon ko to khaarij kar sakati he sieji jaisi sanvaidhanik sanstha kii report ko kaise jhuthla sakati he? If you are thinking of buying gold in the middle of the wedding season then there is bad news for you
 darasal, sone kaa bhav saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya he
 On Friday, the price of gold reached Rs 34 thousand 468 per 10 grams in early trade
 multi camodity exange (emsiex) par yah 6 saal kaa ucchtam str he
 Earlier, on 28 August 2013, gold reached 35 thousand 074 per 10 grams
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko bhi sona main record teji rahi
 What was the global situation? If you talk about global, gold on Friday is 11
 45 dollar yani 0
 1,408, up 82 percent
 35 dollar prati ounce par kaarobaar kar rahaa tha jabaki isse pehle sone kaa bhav 1,414
 Bounced to $ 95 an ounce
 yah sitambar 2013 ke baad kaa str he jab sone kaa bhav 1,416 dollar prati ounce tak chalaa gaya tha
 Explain that the price of gold in the international market is decided on the basis of ounces
 kya he sone main teji kii vajahakamodity bazaar ke jaankaar bataate hai ki haalia bhuraajnneetik tanaav ke bich america kendriya bank dwaara byaaj dar main katautee kaa sanket die jane ke baad surakshit nivesh ke prati niveshkon kaa rujhaan badhane se antarrashtriya bazaar main sone main lagaataar teji dekhi ja rahi he
 Ajay Kedia, director of Kedia Commodity, said, "the US central bank has indicated that it may cut interest rates in the upcoming meeting, which will continue to weaken the dollar
" ''unhone aage bataaya ki duniyabar main takreeban 60-65 fisadi vittiya kaarobaar dollar main hota he
 Therefore, due to weakness in the dollar, the trend of investors increases towards gold because it is the safe way for the investor
 kedia ke mutabik haal hi main khadi kshetra kii ghatana ke baad america or iran ke bich tanaav kaa maahaul he
 Whenever geopolitical tensions rise or for some reason economic activities are weak, investors are excited about investing in gold rather than stocks, so there is a sharp trend in gold

 darasal, himanshu roy kaa daawa un 4 hajaar email par aadhaarit he jo yasin bhatkal or pakistan main uske aakaaon ne ekadusre ko bheje hai
 Roy said, 'we have solid evidence that the terror attacks were sponsored by Pakistan

 Do not know the extent to which Pakistan should be expected to cooperate
 'hafiz said ke aatank se jude hai tareetis chif ne kaha ki unke paas is baat ke bhi puure saboot hai ki pakistan or hafiz said ke taar aatank se jude hai

 Vidarbha fast bowler Rajneesh Gurbani, who took a hat-trick in the Ranji Trophy final, said he was working on increasing the pace in bowling
 gurbani (59 ran par chah wicket) kii hetric se aaj match ke duusare din vidarbha ne dilli ko pehali pari main 295 ran par samet diya
 Earlier, Gurbani played a key role in the team's victory against Karnataka by taking 12 wickets in the match

 Gurbani's hat-trick of Vidarbha, for the first time after 44 years in the Ranji final, he said, "usually we start training three months before the session, but this time we started this work a month ago
" mere kaarykram main ek din gym or ek din kshamta badhaane par kaam hota tha
 i know that there is a lot of improvement in terms of fitness as well
 'gurbani ne kaha ki hetric gend se pehle unhen iske bare main yaad nahin tha

 According to US President Barack Obama, apartheid remains a smear on society even today
 unhone kaha ki america main ab bhi unke liye N-shabd (nigro) kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Obama made this comment on Monday in an interview to Commander Mark Maron
 obama ne kaha ki unke janm se lekar ab tak nasl ke prati logon kaa ravaiya kaaphi badla he, lekin daastaa kii parampara kaa prabhaav ab tak puri tarah se nahin gaya he
 He said, 'it is still in our DNA, which keeps on going from generation to generation
 'buudhvaar ko dakshin kerolina ke ek carch main hui golibari kii ghatana kaa zikr karte hue obama ne kaha, 'hamalavar jis baat se prerit tha vah hamen yaad dilaati he kinaslbhed ab bhi samaaj par ek dhabbahai jise hamen milakar dur karnaa hoga

 dilli se sate uttar pradesh ke noida main guuruuvaar metro aspataal main lagi aag se jude maamle main bada khulaasa hua he
 In the Metro Hospital, the water sprinkler system was present only in the basement, while there was no facility to extinguish the goods
 saaf he ki jaanch main aspataal kii laaparvaahee saamne ai thi
 When there was a fire in the hospital on Thursday, many patients were admitted there
 aspataal prashasan kii jo kamiyaan saamne ai hai, usamen pataa laga he ki aag bujhane ke liye jo sprincolor hota he vah sirf basament main the
 The floor above did not feature sprinklers
 agnishman adhikari ke mutabik, aag bujhane ke jitne bhi upkaran aspataal main the vah paryaapt nahin the
 In 2018, the fire license was not renewed due to the non-sprinkler and the hospital did not receive a NOC
 isko lekar agnishman vibhaag ne aspataal ko notice jari kiya tha, lekin koi jawaab nahin mila tha
 The hospital had hydrants on only one floor, while there should be two hydrants on each floor according to the area
 ek floor par tho fire agsit hi nahin tha
 According to the fire officer, the hydrants that were used to extinguish the fire were not in sufficient quantity, the fire is extinguished with these hydrants in which horse pipes are installed
 adhikari ke mutabik, fire vibhaag limitesan act ke tahat aspataal ko notice jari karegaa, agar kamiyaan dur nahin huin to maamla court tak ja saktaa he
 Significantly, there was a fire in the Metro Hospital located in Sector 12, Noida on Thursday
 is dauraan kareeb 3 darjan marij funs gaye the, jinhen kaanch ke shishe todakar baahar nikaala gaya
 Due to full smoke in the hospital, the patients suffered a lot and soon they were shifted to another branch of the hospital located in Sector 11
 jab air asia kaa jahaaj 10 march ko dilli se udakar dabolim airport par utraa to manohar parrikar ne sankalp liya ki ve ab dobaaraa dilli nahin jaaenge
 He was confident that he would take over as the Chief Minister of Goa for the third time
 or 14 march ko unhone 22 vidhayakon—bijepi ke 13, maharashtravaadi gomantak party (emjeepi) ke 3, goa forward ke 3 or teen nirdaleey—ke samarthan ke saath shapath lekar vahi kiya
 But at the same time, he lost his face and his faith among those who had long considered him his hero
 congress vidhayak dal ke netaa chandrakant kaavlekar ne turant supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya lekin usne kaavlekar kii arji khaarij kar di
 The court said that Congress should have convinced Governor Mridula Sinha to show majority
 baharhaal, parrikar ko yah inaam aasaani se nahin mila
 He and Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had to spend 16 hours awake, including the entire night of March 11, to persuade MGP, Goa Forward and Independents to help form the government
 bhaajapa ke ek andruni sutara ne bataaya ki kis tarah nijee sambandh or jati kii raajnneeti kaa daanv khelkar donon ne emjeepi ke sudin dhawalikar, goa forward ke vijay saradesai or nirdaleey rohan khanvate—teenon brahman—ko samarthan dene ke liye raji kiya
 Another independent Govind Gowde also supported the BJP, as the BJP supported him in the Priol assembly seat where he defeated Sudin's younger brother Deepak
 ek anya nirdaleey prasad gaanvkar ne bhi sinha kii ore se parrikar ko mukhyamantri banaae jane ke baad bhaajapa kaa samarthan kar diya
 The Government of Goa has always been dependent on the money of New Delhi
 or yah nirbharta tab or bad jaati he jab rajya sarkaar ke paas vidhansabha main bahumat na ho
 This is the reason why allies and independents decided to go with the BJP
 isse pehle choti partiyaan congress ke saath jaaya karti thim, kyonki tab vah centre kii satta main hoti thi
 Now Parrikar has promised the allies that they will get more money for Goa due to their ties in Delhi
 itnaa hi nahin, ve mahatvakankshi dhawalikar ke liye yah bhi sunishchit karenge ki unhen vah vibhaag mil jaae, jo ve chaahate hai, yani unka pasandida lok nirmaan vibhaag
 Dhavalikar was previously a friend of Parrikar's rival Subhash Velingkar
 weylingkar goa main aresas ke purv pramukh the, jinhone bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye goa suraksha manch bana liya tha
 After Dhavalikar supported the BJP, Welingkar said, "MGP is an independent party
 ve koi bhi faisla lene ke liye aaazaad hai
 We will continue our agitation against grant to English medium schools
 "parrikar ne goa forward ke teenon vidhayakon, khanvate or gaude ko mantri bana diya he
 The BJP has only three mlas in the 10-member cabinet
 iske badale party ko vidhansabha adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh chunane ko milenge
 However, it will be a tough challenge for Parrikar to keep everyone together after forming the government
 khaskar saradesai, jo utane hi mahatvakankshi hai or pehle kii sarkaar main vipakshi vidhayakon main sabase mukhar the or parrikar par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhen ''fiksar" kii sangya diya karte the
 He has joined the BJP against the wishes of party president Prabhakar Timbale and many activists
 lekin unke paas koi rasta bhi nahin tha
 Had the Congress not betrayed him by landing his candidate in Fatorda, Sardesai and two other mlas would have supported the party to form the government
 saradesai kehete hai, ''main jaanata hum ki mere party ke log mere faisle se naaraaz hai, lekin mujhe janata ke faisle kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 "in the last two years, Parrikar has become infamous for his rude attitude and forgetting his promise in the party organization
 jab se ve angreji madhyam ke skulon ko aarthik madad roak dene or kisino ko samudr main phenk dene ke apane vaade se mukare hai, tab se unki kchayaati palaturam vaali ho chuki he
 Now they have to show that they are working people, not just promising people
 misaal ke taur par vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar main parrikar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki centre sarkaar kii harek ke liye makaan kii yojana pehle madagaanv or juvari nagar main shuru hogi
 He said in Juwari Nagar, "you will see that the construction of houses will start in 2019
" " unhen ab is yojana ko praathamikta deni hogi
 They will also have to accelerate the job of generating employment
 iske alaava kai tarah ke paryaton ko badhaava dena, paryaavaran se lekar medical, dharohar, dharmik, adventure or gramin paryaton ko bhi badhaava dene kaa kaam karnaa hoga
 The BJP in its manifesto promised that it would set up pollution-free industries in the fields of medicine, electronics, manufacturing and information technology
 parrikar ko ghoshnaa patr ke vaadon ko amali jama pehanaane par dhyaan dena hoga
 Goa is already losing 20 percent of its revenue due to the mining ban
 aamadani main baari nuksaan ke baavjood sarkaar ne saamaajik kalyaan kii yojanaon ko jari rakhaa he
 Parrikar will have to look for new options to boost income and bring the state economy back on track
 iske alaava, parrikar ne bhale hi sadan main bahumat ke liye jaruri sankhya kaa jugad kar liya ho, lekin unki is yogyata kii pariksha vipaksh main baithe congress ke anbhavi vidhayakon kii maujuudagi main hoti rahegi
 The five former chief ministers — Pratapsingh Rane, Digambar Kamat, Ravi Naik, Luizinho Falerio and Churchill Alemao — will have the support of Dayanand Sopte, Subhash Shirodkar, Isidore Fernandes, and Neelkant Halarnkar, who returned to the Assembly after a 10-year hiatus
 is bich, congress ko ekajutata banaae rakhni hogi, kyonki uske chah vidhayak sadan main sabase badi party hone ke baavjood sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar paane main uski asamarthta ko lekar khuleam apni naaraazgi jaahir kar rahe hai
 There is already speculation that he may leave the Congress and join the BJP
 chunaav nattejey bhi dikhaate hai ki parrikar kaa jaadu feekaa pad rahaa he
 He campaigned from house to house for BJP candidate Subhash Faldesai in Sanguem
 lekin matadaataaon ne 937 voton ke antar se nirdaleey ummidavaar prasad gaanvkar ko jita diya
 Parrikar had tried hard to stop the impact of Khaonte in Porvorim, but could not stop this influential independent candidate from winning twice from the same place
 khanvate goa main aise pehle nirdaleey ummidavaar hai jinhone lagaataar do baar chunaav jeeta he
 Parrikar had to induct him in his cabinet while he campaigned tirelessly against him in the elections
 goa main bhaajapa ke vidhayakon kii sankhya paanch varshon main kam hui he, jabaki ye paanch saal buniyadi vikaas, saamaajik kalyaan or healthcare ke maamle main sabase achche rahe hai
 The first and foremost challenge for Parrikar will be to regain the trust of the loyal voters of the BJP, who this time went to the MGP and independents
 bhaajapa ne 2012 main 21 siton ke saath 34
 Had secured 7 percent votes
 2017 main iske voton kaa pratishat ghatakar 32
 9 percent
 uske vipareet emjeepi ke voton kaa pratishat 6
 11 percent increase from 7 percent
 3 pratishat ho gaya he
 The main reason for this was that Konkani speaking Hindus, who have traditionally been supporters of the BJP, were badly offended by the government's policy of promoting English in place of Konkani
 is baar unhone emjeepi kaa saath dene kaa faisla kiya
 MGP also has a strong base among Hindus and was with GSM
 goa forward ke samarthak ramakant kerakar kehete hai ki bhaajapa ko sarkari kaamkaaj ke madhyam ke mudde or uske mantriyon ke ahankaar ke chalate nuksaan hua
 Parrikar admits that some of the BJP candidates had to bear the brunt of the anti-incumbency wave
 ve kehete hai, ''log ek party ke taur par bhaajapa se naaraaz nahin the, lekin kuch ummidavaaron ko lekar naakhush the
 2,000 to 3,000 votes on a small assembly seat can also change the outcome
 " satta-virdohi bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi bhaajapa ne meyam (praveen jante), kumbarajua (pandurang madkaikar) or dabolim (mouvin godinho) main congress chhodkar aae ummidavaaron ko tikat diya
 He did not give the ticket to Sports Minister Ramesh Tawadkar, and it suffered
 tawarkar baghawat par utar aae or bijepi ummidavaar vijay pai khot ko haraane main madad kar di
 Former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar and three other key ministers — Rajendra Arlekar, Dayanand Mandrekar and Dilip Parulekar — lost the election
 parsekar ko alag-thalag rahane or electronic city ke naam par jameen hadapney ke aaropon kii keemat chukaani padi
 While Arlekar was incapacitated, Mandrekar and Parulekar were primarily known for their muscle power
 inako hataane main parrikar kii vifaltaa bhaajapa ke liye mahangi sabit hui, khaskar uttari goa ke uske garh main
 In 2012, it won 12 out of 21 seats here
 jo is baar ghatakar aath ho gai
 In fact, if the BJP had not given tickets to Catholic candidates, its number of members would have been reduced to single digits
 aisa pehali baar hoga jab bhaajapa ke catholic vidhayakon kii sankhya hindu vidhayakon se zyada hogi
 Seven of the bjp's 13 mlas — Francis d'souza, Nilesh Cabral, Michael Lobo, Glenn Tickalo, Alaina Saldanha, Godinho and Jose Louise Carlos Almeida — are Catholic
 parrikar ne aksar kaha he ki unhen dilli ke butter chikan kii jagah goa kii fish kari zyada pasand he
 But this time it can prove difficult to enjoy this curry
 jammu-kashmir kepanchayat chunaavka raajnneetik dalon dwaara bahishkaar kiye jane or aatankiyon kii ghuspaith kii ghatana kii kendriya grih rajyamantrihansraj ahirne kadi aalochana kii he
 He said that it is very unfortunate that some parties are boycotting the panchayat elections to be held in the state
 unhone is chunaav main hissaa lene vaali partiyon kaa swaagat kiya he
 He said that many parties and people are participating in the elections, which we welcome
 namakan waapas lene ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki yah koi nai baat nahin he
 Nominations keep coming back
 dilli samet deshbhar main chunaav main namakan waapas liye jane kii baat saamne aati rahati he
 It should not be feared by terrorists' warning
 unhone kaha ki chunaav namakan ke liye logon ne form bharaa he
 However, it is true that the number of nominees has been small
 yahaan loktantr he
 So there should be an election
 chunaav hone se loktantr bana rahegaa or log shanti ke saae main ji sakenge
 The area will also develop
 kendriya mantrine kaha kijammu-kashmir main chunaavanhin hone se vikaas ke kaaryon main rukaawat aati he
 Money does not reach for development work
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki pidipi or neshnal conference kii baat to chhod dijie
 They have not done well by deciding to boycott the election
 inako loktantr main vishwaas karke chunaav main hissaa lenaa chahie
 Due to the stubborn attitude of PDP and National Conference, the courage of terrorists can increase
 ghuspaith ke liye lonching pad par baithe aatankiyon par hansraj ahir ne kaha ki wo kitni bhi koshish kar len, lekin ghuspaith main safal nahin honge
 Our security forces are deployed along the border
 wo aatankiyon ko munhtod jawaab denge
 We stand fully with the security forces
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kii napak harkaton ko lagaataar jawaab diya ja rahaa he
 It is known that 250 terrorists are sitting across the border from 27 to 250 terrorists
 ye aatanki kashmir ghati main ghuspaith kar panchayat chunaav main khalal daalana chaahate hai
 There are also security forces on the target of these terrorists

 Ajay's stunts in the 1991 film Phool Aur Kaante became an inspiration to the youth at one time
 bachapan se hi ajay ko aag se khilne kaa shauk tha
 He was not afraid of anything
 tasviir main dekhen to tendue ke shaavak ko pakadaney ke baavjood ajay ke chehre par muskaan he
 He is seen carrying the cub without fear

 His film Tanaji: The Unsung Warrior will also come soon
 bataa den ki kuch dinon pehle abhinetri tanushri datta ne ajay devgan par mitu abhiyaan main aropit alokanath sang kaam karne ko lekar bhadaas nikaali thi
 Angered by Tanushree's stance, Ajay clarified that the shooting of Aloknath's part in the film De De Pyar De was over before the allegations were exposed
 inako rishute karnaa mumkin nahin tha
 It may soon become mandatory for commercial vehicles to install fastags and tracking systems
 centre sarkaar ne iske liye masauda taiyaar kar liya he
 The government can change the Motor Vehicle Act for this
 is draft main or kai badlaav kii bhi charchaa he
 According to the draft, a provision has been made to provide driving license and pollution control certificate (PUC) in digital form
 ye suvidha in dastavejon kophysical formamen rakhane kii suvidha ke saath milegi
 Along with this, emphasis has been laid on the elimination of the fitness certificate requirement of new vehicles at the time of registration
 masaude ke mutabik jin vyavsaayik vaahanon ke paas neshnal permit hoga, unako kisi bhi haal main fastag ko apane wind screen par lagaana hoga
 The toll gate on the National Highway provides a separate lane for Fastag trains
 likhnaa jaruri he neshnal permitnational permit ko hasil karne vaale gadiyon ko bade aksharon main neshnal permit vaahan ke aage yaa peeche likhnaa jaruri hoga
 Larger vehicles will have NP write on the rear and left side of the trailer
 baari samaanon kii dhulaai karne vaale vaahan ko safed rang main paint karnaa hoga
 Behind such vehicles, light reflecting planks have to be installed
 fitness pramaan patr kii nahi he aavashyaktadraft main yah praavdhaan bhi laayaa gaya he ki registration ke vakt nai gadiyon kaa fitness pramaan patr dikhaanaa jaruri nahin hoga
 They will have a certificate for 2 years from the date of registration
 aath saal puraane vaahanon or isse zyada puraane vaahanon ko do saal or kramash: ek saal kaa fitness pramaan patr diya jayega
 Top ministers of the government have made it clear that no minister in the Modi government has been authorized to preside over the meeting of the Union Cabinet in the absence of the Prime Minister
 iskaa sidhaa matlab ye he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii videsh yatra ke dauraan kisi bhi mantri ko duusare number kaa darja nahin diya gaya he
 However, before the start of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Brazil, a note has been issued by the Cabinet Secretariat, which said that the CCPA will take decisions on the cabinet's political affairs committee on the most important matters
 sisipie main pradhanmantri ke alaava das or mantri hai, jinamein bijepi ke chah or sahyogi dalon ke chaar mantri shaamil hai
 According to a senior minister, whether the Prime Minister stays in the country or abroad, he is the Prime Minister and that is why there is no need to give second number status to any other minister
 jahaan tak sansad main uthne vaale muddon kaa sawaal he, to satr ke dauraan har rose sansadeey maamalon kii cabinet samiti kii baithak hoti he
 This meeting takes place in his office when the Prime Minister is in the country
 jabaki unki gaiyr maujuudagi main sansadeey kaarymantri ke karyaalay main ye baithak yojit hoti he, jisamen sansad main uthne vaale sambhavit muddon par ranneeti tay hoti he
 In this committee, apart from the Prime Minister, Home Minister Rajnath Singh Defense and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu and Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari are included
 pradhanmantri kii gaiyr maujuudagi main bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak bhi hone ja rahi he, jo sansadeey kaarymantri naidu ne aahut kii he
 Being the senior-most leader in it, LK Advani as Deputy Leader of Parliamentary Party in Lok Sabha, Rajnath Singh as Deputy Leader of Parliamentary Party in Rajya Sabha and Arun Jaitley and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs will lead the meeting
 gauratlab he ki bijepi sansadeey dal kii kaaryakarini kaa bhi gathan kiya gaya he, jisamen rajnath singh or arun jetali ko upanetaa banaaya gaya he
 That is, both are kept together
 haalanki yah spasht kiya gaya he ki jahaan narendra modi loksabhaa ke netaa hai, vahiin rajya sabha ke netaa arun jetali hai
 The sitting position in Parliament also does not give a clue about the number two leader
 loksabhaa main pradhanmantri modi ke saath kii jagah khaali he or unke baad rajnath singh kaa sthaan he
 But when Jaitley came to read the budget speech, he was accommodated with Modi and Rajnath sat next to him, while Jaitley sits first in the Rajya Sabha and Modi after him
 vishleshkon ke mutabik, loksabhaa main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke saath kii jagah khaali hoti thi
 Whereas Pranab Mukherjee used to sit in Lok Sabha with Arjun Singh next to PV Narasimha Rao, LK Advani and Manmohan Singh next to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 kendriya mantrimandal kii suchi main rajnath singh kaa naam modi ke baad aata he
 He is followed by Sushma Swaraj and then Arun Jaitley
 kendriya mantrimandal kii pehali baithak main bhi rajnath singh modi ke saath baithe the
 Who is after the Prime Minister? This suspense was also sustained for a long time in the UPA government
 iskaa jawaab janvari 2009 main mila tha, jab manmohan singh kii bypass sajarri hui thi or tab pranab mukherjee ko kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak kii adhyakshata karne ko kaha gaya tha
 But shortly after, on 26 January, Defense Minister AK Antony was given the opportunity to lead the Republic Day celebrations
 yani mantrimandal main duusare number ke netaa ko lekar asamanjas koi nai baat nahin he
 Perhaps the Prime Ministers also feel that the picture should remain blurred
 bharat kaa gharelu cricket jab badlaav laane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he tab mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ne shanivaar ko suzav diya ki ranjai trophy kaa prayek match do alag-alag pichon par khelaa janaa chahie, jisase ki videshi dauron ke liye behatar test team taiyaar kii ja sake
 To make the bilateral series even more exciting, Tendulkar suggested that the two teams should have two consecutive series on the basis of domestic and foreign soil, so that the strength of both teams in different circumstances can be assessed
 ek hi ranjai match main do pichon kaa tendulkar kaa suzav logon ko haalanki adhik romaanchak laga
 Sachin Tendulkar said during the 'hindustan Times Leadership Summit', "I thought a lot about the neutral places in the Ranji Trophy (this season which is being tested)
" mere paas ek suzav he
 When we go to places like Australia, New Zealand, West Indies and South Africa, we play with Kookaburra balls which swing in the beginning
 aise main us yuva ranjai ballebaaj ke bare main sochie jo bharat main esji test gend se kheltaa he or iske baad videshon main use mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘aisa karte hai pehali pari kukabura gend se ghasiyaali pichon par karaate hai jisase salaami ballebaajon ko chunauti milegi
 Even the bowlers will get help
 hamaare spinner bhi ghasiyaali pichon par kukabura gend se gendbaaji seekhenge
 '' tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘is ghasiyaali pich ke saath hi duusari pich honi chahie jo puri tarah se spin ke anukool ho
 The second innings should be played on this pitch with SG test ball, which will also help our bowlers to play against level spin bowling
 ham videshi halaat main tej gendbaaji ko khilne main kaaphi dhyaan lagaate hai lekin hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki spin gendbaaji ko kaise khelen
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘mat bhuuliye ki videshi timen bhi bharat main hamaare se haar rahi hai
 Maybe they start using SG balls in their home matches
 ’’ tendulkar ne kaha ki do paariyaan do pichon par khilne se curator team ke anukool pich taiyaar nahin kar paaenge or saath hi toss kii bhoomika bhi simit ho jaaegi
 He said, "the captain will think that by winning the toss, he will get only 10 percent of the right to choose the first batting but if he chooses to bowl first on the pitch, he should remember that he should play on a spin friendly pitch in the fourth innings 
 Will happen
 ’’ tendulkar jab yah suzav de rahe the to darshakon ke bich bisisiai adhyaksh anuraag thakur bhi maujuud the
 The comments test cricket main ghatate darshakon ke bare main poochne par tendulkar ne iske liye lambey praaroop main pratidwandvita kii kami or tii20 cricket ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) To make the bilateral series even more exciting, Tendulkar suggested that the two teams should have two consecutive series on the basis of domestic and foreign soil, so that the strength of both teams in different circumstances can be assessed

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Tendulkar's suggestion of two pitches in the same Ranji match, however, was more exciting
 sachin tendulkar ne ‘hindustan times leadership summit’ ke dauraan kaha, ‘‘maine ranjai trophy main tatasth sthanon (is satr main jis par pareekshan ho rahaa he) ke bare main kaaphi soch vichaar kiya
 i have a suggestion
 jab ham australia, newjiland, westeindies or dakshin africa jaise sthanon par jate hai to kukabura gendon se khelte hai jo shuru main swing karti hai
 So think of that young Ranji batsman who plays with SG test ball in India and after that he has to face difficulties abroad
 ’’ He said, "let's do the first innings with Kookaburra ball on the crocodile pitches, which will challenge the openers
" yahaan tak ki gendbaajon ko madad milegi
 Our spinners will also learn bowling with the Kookaburra ball on Ghasiali pitches
 ’’ Tendulkar said, "there should be a second pitch along with this ghastly pitch which is completely spin-friendly
" duusari pari is pich par esji test gend se kheli jaani chahie, jisase hamaaregendbaajon ko stareey spin gendbaaji ke khilaaf khilne main bhi madad milegi
 We focus a lot on playing fast bowling in foreign conditions but we should not forget how to play spin bowling
 ’’ He said, "don't forget that foreign teams are also losing to us in India
 shaayad ve apane gharelu maichon main esji gendon kaa istemaal shuru kar den
 Tendulkar said that by playing two innings on two pitches, the curators will not be able to create a team friendly pitch and the role of the toss will also be limited
 unhone kaha, ‘‘captain sochane lagegaa ki toss jitkar use pehle batting chunane ke adhikaar se sirf 10 pratishat hi phayda milegaa lekin agar vah ghasiyaali pich par pehle gendbaaji chunata he to use yaad rakhana chahie ki use chauthi pari main spin kii anukool pich par khelnaa hoga
 When Tendulkar was suggesting this, BCCI President Anurag Thakur was also present among the audience
 tippaniyan Asked about the dwindling audience in Test cricket, Tendulkar blamed the lack of long-form rivalry and T20 cricket for this

 No matter how special the survey is, it becomes very common with time, the astounding elements are reduced in it, rather it becomes a good spice of gossip
 india today sex surveykshan bhi 15 saal se jari he or media main kahakahon kaa hissaa bhi ban gaya he
 The nuances of the surveys of the years remain little to be remembered, and usually by combining them together like a puzzle of social science, these different firefighters look like shining but disappointment in trying to find a trend of change
 is
 asal main surveykshan ke bich main vah bhartiya purush khadaa miltaa he, jo kisi bhi tarah se dhilaa padataa nahin dikhataa
 That symbol of male dominated society, completely irrespective of changing circumstances, is making the results of sex survey with Khap Panchayat mentality meaningless like science
 badlaav kii halchal, uttejnaa sirf paroksh taur par dikhti he, jahaan auraten kisi duusari duniya kii sambhaavna talashti najar aati hai
 After looking at the figures of changes in men over the years, one particular thing about him seems almost irreversible
 jahaan tak sex kaa maamla he, vah santusht dikhataa he, apane lakshya or pasand ke bare main use koi duvidha nahin he
 According to the survey, 55 percent of the men in the age group of 18-55 seem happy about sex
 unke liye sex vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa ve chaahate hai
 It is an everyday ritual that is done without a condom, because the condom does not give it that much of pleasure
 purush kii shuchita, khaskar comarya ko lekar spasht aakankshaayen hai
 56 percent of men have a clear opinion that they will not marry a girl or woman who has had pre-marital sex
 kam se kam 76 pratishat purushon kii raay ekadam saaf he ki vivaah se sex karne kaa adhikaar mil jaataa he
 The woman almost becomes his property and forced sex becomes commonplace
 jane-anjaane bhartiya purush ke liye sex akele kaa maamla he, baad main vah tay nahin kar paata ki vah mahaj pump bana tha yaa kya
 The question of unwanted pregnancy hardly bothers her
 haal ke daur main vah kuch satark rahane laga he
 Personality seeks safe sex to preserve
 purush ko pornography pasand he, vah use anand kii anubhuti badhaane vaale gyaan kii tarah dekhtaa he or kuchhek porn filmon main dikhe drishyon jaise abhyaas kii koshish karata he
 Due to prioritizing fun, he sometimes organizes overnight and 37 percent talk about experiencing some form of gay sex
 anubhavon ke nae maukey khulne se purushon ko kaarysthal nae maidan dikhte hai
 16 percent admitted that they had sought sex in exchange for a job promotion
 isse kul milakar jo saamaajik tasviir ubhartee he, vah charchaa laayak nahin he
 Men are not on the side of change, while women want to look through every window of change
 aazaadee, antarangta or maan-sammaan hasil karne ke har maukey kii tad main rahati hai
 For them, fun and intimacy are important even for just one day, so in such a situation, love does not matter
 darasal 33 pratishat mahilaayein anand or mouj-masti se adhik suraksha ko, sex or antarang sambandhon ke badale vittiya suraksha ko adhik mahatv detii hai
 In a sense, it seems a strange contradiction that moralist, hypocritical men make women with less morality wanting freedom
 halaat badalane kii sambhaavna kam hi dikhti he kyonki maa-baap sex shiksha se usee tarah bidakate hai, jaise purush condom ke naam par
 The possibility of independence and change in small cities and towns creates curiosity, but in the towns of the country one must wait till the winds of change start flowing freely
 surveykshan se lagata he ki sex koi rishta, koi saahchary nahin balki uttejnaa kii ek daihik kriya adhik he jo auraton ke vyavhaar ke bare main ek shuddhtavaadi nazariye se ghira hota he
 The woman may think of a second possibility, but the man, especially after the family marital bonds, sees the woman as a maid only fulfilling her sex-related needs
 deh ko lekar bani dharna main haal ke daur main aae badlaav, chote shaharon-kasbon main aae paroksh badlaav, condom kii uplabdhta vagairah se purush kii maansikta yaa samay bodh main koi fark nahin aayaa he
 There is such a feeling in a man's eyes as if he has no role in the pregnancy
 purush kii is sthir maansikta ko digane main sex or soochna kranti khaas myne nahin rakhti
 In such a backdrop, someone rushes the 2017 survey to hear rumors of change
 takneekee arthon main condom yaa har subah garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa seven abhi bhi asaamaanya he
 Sometimes there is a slight increase in finding opportunities for sex
 twitor or camera ek sukhad ehsaas bhar rahaa he kyonki kam se kam 10 pratishat log ardhangn avasthaa main video or photo saajha karte hai
 The condom sounds a bit of a mess, but the video leads to lust and excitement or at least gossip
 video swap or pornography kii badaulat dhire-dhire soshal media par ek nai duniya aakaar le rahi he
 People are opening up to new experiments as internet sex and phone sex are making 20 per cent blissful
 kasbon main khushhaal sex jivan kii aas kaaphi oonchi he
 About 80 to 90 percent of people have the same aspiration
 phir bhi yah poochne par ki sangini kii deh kaa koun-sa ang aapmen ''uttejnaa" jagaa detaa he, logon ke jawaab kiraanaa dukaan kii kisi fehrist jaise lagate hai
 70 percent of people are still in need of virginity and straight sex is the norm
 isse yahi ummid kii ja sakati he ki isse alahada vichaar rakhane vaale baaki 30 pratishat log hi kuch alag karne se lekar aazaadee kaa ek nayaa bhav paidaa kar sakate hai
 It can also be expected that with the purist attitude loosening about sex, the world has started to become a possibility other than marriage
 vivaah ek kartavya he lekin sex kuch sukhad ehsaas detaa he, jaisaa ki surveykshan main ek raat ke sambandh or vivaah-purv sex ke bare main ubhari raay se pataa chalata he
 Sex is now more of a habit, a claim to rights, than looking for fun or lust
 is tarah bhartiya purush badlaav kii bayaaron se anchhua sthirataa kii murti bana hua he
 (shiva Vishwanathan is a well-known socialist) ubar air or kai anya videshi companiyaan udne vaali taxi launch karne kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 But in the meantime, some promising young researchers from India are going to work on the project of starting indigenous flying taxis
 yah flying taxi puri tarah se maid in india hogi or 2023 tak ise taiyaar karne kaa lakshya he
 It is worth noting that due to heavy traffic and traffic jam on the roads, work is now being done to develop alternative means of transport in developed countries
 ab bharat bhi is daud main shaamil ho gaya he
 Giants like Google, Airbus, Uber, Volvo are working on developing driverless cars
 ubarar, alon musk kii boring company or hiparaloop van jaisi companiyaan airtaxi yaa underground transport system viksit karne par kaam kar rahi hai
 The good news for us Indians has come from IIT Kanpur, which has signed an agreement with a private company VTOL Aviation India this month
 15 karod rupee ke is qaraar ke tahat iaiti ke 100 se zyada research student ek prototip hawaii taxi viksit karenge, jise commercial flying taxi ke liye istemaal kiya ja sakegaa
 The project will be completed by 2023
 bharat main yah takanic abhi bahut shishav avasthaa main he, lekin agar hamaare yuva researchrs ko safalataa mil gai to isse dilli, mumbai jaise mahanagaron main badhati trephic samasya se nijaat mil sakati he
 To be completed in five years, under the project agreement, the researchers of iits will have to complete this project in the next five years
 iaiti kanpur ke airospes ejineering or flite lab ke pramukh ajoy ghosh ne bataaya, 'ham concept par kaam karenge or pramukh technology kshetron kii pahchaan karenge
 In the following years more than 100 students will work on it
 'mek in india par jorpm modi ke mek in india abhiyaan ko or gati dete hue vitioel aviation india ne ek project shuru kiya he, jiskaa naam 'vitioel air taxi abhiyaan' rakhaa gaya he
 Under this, the company will create state-of-the-art VTOL aircraft through which economical and rapid traffic services can be provided
 vitioel kaa matlab he vertical tech-of and landing
 This technique is used to land an aircraft directly on the ground and fly above the ground
 prastaavit 'flying taxi' vidyut power se kaam karegi, isliye isamen puri tarah se clin energy kaa istemaal hoga
 However, the introduction of such a taxi would require the approval of government and regulators

 Samajwadi Party national president Mulayam Singh Yadav is not taking the name of the difficulties being reduced to alleviate the resentment of Muslims after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 hathkargha evam vastra udyog ke salaahkaar moulana tawqir raja khan ne istipha dekar mulaayam ko ek bada jhatka de diya he
 The reason for this is that they have not been able to work properly for the SP government
 moulana tawqir raja khan ke mutabik sapa sarkaar main musalamaanon ke masale hal nahin ho rahe hai
 All Muslims who have been rendered homeless by the Muzaffarnagar riots want to return to their villages, but the government is not able to provide them adequate security
 un gaanvon main police chaowkee sthapit karke is kaam ko aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he, magar sarkaar kii isamen koi ruchi nahin he
 For Muslims who do not want to return to their homes, they had made a demand to build a colony before the government, but this was not even considered
 moulana kaa aarope he ki danga ayog ke gathan, begunaah musalamaanon ke khilaaf darj cese waapas lene or pisies (je) main urdu ke parche kii unki maang bhi ansuni kar di gai

 On 25 August the Registrar General of the Government of India released the data of religious groups
 uski kis tarah se reporting hui ye ham aapako dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 First Hindi newspaper headlines see the headline
 - dharm kaa siyaasi data, chunaav se pehle janaganana ke aankade, muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi (navabharat times) - Hindus decreased, Muslims increased (population) - aabaadi main muslamon kii hissedari 0
 Hindus increased by 8%, 0
 7% ghati (dainik bhaskar) - Sikhs, Buddhists also decreased, Christians and Jains were ineffective - ausat vruddhi dar se zyaada he muslimon kii badhat - Statistics will become a big issue in Bihar elections dainik bhaskar ne ek chote se box main yah bhi bataaya ki agar hindu musalmaan kii aabaadi maujuuda dar se badhati rahi to donon ko barabaar hone main 270 lag jaayenge yani 2285 main aisa hote hote bharat kii aabaadi 13,000 karod ho jaaegi
 Similarly, the scroll news site has also written that for 100 years it is being intimidated that one day Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 aisa hone ke liye maujuuda dar se musalmaan kii aabaadi badhati rahi to 200 saal main musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 Then India's population will be 3,264 crore
 lagata he dainik bhaskar or scrol kaa calculator kuch alag he
 India's population from 13000 crores to 3,264 crores
 mujhe nahin lagata ki tab musalmaan bhi bahut khush honge ki dekhon ab ham itane honge nau ve haev no problem
 If you imagine, you will be scared
 hindu ke liye bhi or musalmaan ke liye bhi
 Man will run over man
 khayr
 Let's see some more newspapers
 - badi muslim hissedari (dainik jaagran) - Population speed: Hindus slow, Muslims fast (amar Ujala) - aisa pehali baar hua ki hinduon kii aabaadi 80% se neeche ai - By the year 2050 there will be 180 crore Hindus and 41 crore Muslims - amar ujaalaa ke hisaab se to agle 35 saal tak musalmaan hinduon ke aadhe bhi nahin pahunch paayenge
 So relax rumor gangs
 hindustan akhbaar kii surkhiyaan hai - Muslim population grew fastest - muslimon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 Increased 8% - hinduon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 7% decrease - sabhi hindi akhabaaron main is baat par jor rahaa ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Whereas according to Hindu newspaper, the truth is that the growth rate of population in Muslims has fallen faster than the rest
 di vir main chitra padmanabhan ne likhaa he ki sensos ke aankadon ko sensex kii tarah nahin padhaa janaa chahie
 Like Muslim up Hindu down
 1991-2001 or 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar 29
 24 down from 5
 6 par ai he
 Well done Hindus should also get it
 unki aabaadi kii badhane kii raftaar 19
 16 minus 9 percent
 8 pratishat hui he
 Does the bulk of the media think about Muslims in the same way
 bharat sarkaar kii press relise main or bhi aankaden hai lekin ve shaayad dhyaan aakarshith nahin karte hai
 a newspaper also wrote that Muslims are ahead of Hindus in saving daughters
 - 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon main ling anupaat ek hazaar purushon par 951 he
 At the same time, the sex ratio among Hindus has reached 939 per thousand males
 - haalanki hinduon main sudhaar hua he magar rashtriya ausat 940 se ek kam he
 - Sex ratio among Muslims is 11 more than the national average
 ham sabhi ke bas kii baat nahin he ki aankadon ko baarik nigaah se dekh saken
 Therefore, it is said that many of us accept it when it is not
 angrezi akhbaaron ne is masale ko kaise cover kiya or unki kya hedline thi is par nazar daalate hai
 First the Times of India will then see the headline of Hindustan Times
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all Communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down Although TV should also have been mentioned, but the headlines of the previous days of the channels are not available
 angrezi ke donon bade akhabaaron ne bhi muslim aabaadi badhane ko aage rakhaa
 The headlines of The Indian Express and The Hindu were different, see the Indian Express earlier
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population slows growth - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - mail today ne likhaa ki Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 Told many newspaper headlines so that you can consider how our media society views the news related to Hindu Muslim
 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he
 - 85 in Christian population in Haryana
 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come
 - 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik isai 27,185 the
 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new
 jaan dayaal ne likhaa he ki isai bahul nagaland main to isaayiyon kii aabaadi main 2
 Declined by 83%
 sangh kii kitaaben kahati hai ki nagaland aisa rajya he jahaan isaayiyon kii bahulata bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatara ban rahi he
 Even after the Muslim population has decreased, the population of the entire country is much higher than the average rate of increase
 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population
 agar karti he to ve shaq kya hai
 Why are aresas ke liye yah mudda hameshaa se gambhir rahaa he
 The Sangh believes that there should be a population policy in Dash
 sabhi ke liye do bachche kii niti lagu ho or musalamaanon ke bheetar sudhaar ho
 We will talk about this in detail
 tippaniyan Why do the opposition parties think that it will try to polarize the religious
 bihar chunaav se iskaa taalluk he
 As polarization tools have fallen short
 kya is vajah se ki pehle bhi ye aankade li kiye ja chuke hai
 If some Hindus look at the population of Muslims from another point of view, then how do Hindus see the question of population within themselves
 musalmaan hinduon kii adhik aabaadi ke bare main kya vaise hi darataa hoga jaise uski aabaadi badhane par kuch log hinduon ko daraate hai
 How does a Muslim see the question of population within himself
 kaise dekhnaa chahie
 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he
 But as soon as the figure of increase comes, religion becomes the reason
 is par bhi baat karenge ki kya aabaadi bachche paidaa karne kii raftaar se hi badhati he
 There is also a role of neonatal mortality or prolonged life
 bahut jatil vishay he
 Last time i did prime time, so far rumors were spread in whatsapp regarding one of my things
 aise girohon se saavdhaan rahiye
 But some organizations and parties also look at this question with a look of apprehension
 ve dekhte rahete hai ki kis kis kaa bad rahaa he
 We increased but not those
 25 agast ko bharat sarkaar ke register general ne dharmik samoohon kaa aankada jari kiya
 We want to show you how he was reporting
 pehle hindi akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan hedline dekhte hai
 - Political data of religion, census data before election, Muslim population increased fastest (navbharat Times) - hindu ghat gaye, musalamaanon kii aabaadi main badhotaree (jansatta) - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi, hinduon kii 0
 7% decrease (dainik Bhaskar) - sikh, buddha bhi ghate, isai or jain beasar - Muslim growth is more than average growth rate - bihar chunaav main bada mudda banenge aankade Dainik Bhaskar also told in a small box that if the Hindu Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, it would take 270 to equalize, which means that by 2285, India will have a population of 13,000 crores
 isi tarah scrol news site ne bhi likhaa he ki 100 saal se daraaya ja rahaa he ki ek din musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 For this to happen, if the Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, then in 200 years, Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 tab bharat kii aabaadi 3,264 karod hogi
 The calculator of Dainik Bhaskar and scroll seems to be different
 13000 karod se lekar 3,264 karod bharat kii aabaadi
 i do not think even then the Muslims will be very happy that now we will be so much now we have no problem
 aap kalpana kiijie to dar lagegaa
 For Hindus as well as for Muslims
 aadmi ke upar aadmi chalaa karegaa
 Anyway kuch or akhbaar dekhte hai
 - Increased Muslim share (dainik Jagran) - aabaadi kii raftaar : hinduon kii dhimi, muslimon kii tej (amar ujaalaa) - It was the first time that the population of Hindus came down below 80% - varsh 2050 tak 180 karod hindu or 41 karod muslim honge According to Amar Ujala, for the next 35 years, even half of the Hindus will not be able to reach
 so afvaah failaane vaale giroh relax karen
 Hindustan newspaper headlines are - muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi 0 - The share of Hindus in the population
 7% ghati - In all Hindi newspapers, it was emphasized that the population of Muslims is increasing rapidly
 jabaki hindu akhbaar ke mutabik sachai ye he ki musalamaanon main aabaadi kii vikaas dar baakiyon ke mukaable sabase tej giri he
 In The Wire, Chitra Padmanabhan has written that census figures should not be read like the Sensex
 jaise musalmaan ap hindu down
 The pace of growth of Muslim population between 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 29
 5 se ghatakar 24
 Has arrived at 6
 shaabaashi hinduon ko bhi milani chahie
 The growth rate of their population 19
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 16
 8 percent
 kya media kaa bada hissaa musalamaanon ke bare main ek hi tarah se sochataa he
 There are more figures in the press releases of the Government of India but they probably do not attract attention
 ek akhbaar ne likhaa bhi ki beti bachaane main hinduon se aage hai musalmaan
 - Between 2001-2011, the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 for one thousand men
 - isi dauraan hinduon main ling anupaat prati hazaar purushon par 939 par pahunchaa he
 - Though Hindus have improved, the national average is one less than 940
 - musalamaanon main ling anupaat rashtriya ausat se 11 zyaada he
 It is not a matter of all of us to be able to look at the data closely
 isliye jaisaa bataaya jaataa he hamamen se kai log vaisaa maan lete hai jabaki vaisaa hota nahin he
 Let's look at how the English newspapers covered the issue and what their headline was
 pehle times of india phir uske baad hindustan times kii hedline dekhenge
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down vaise tivi kaa bhi zikr hona chahie tha magar channelon ke pichley dinon ke hedline milte nahin hai

 On the scroll website, Jan Dayal has seen one aspect of these figures from his perspective
 - haryana main isai aabaadi main 85
 An increase of 22 percent has been reported
 - ab is aankade ko dekhte hi lagegaa haryana main jat gaye, isai aa gaye
 - According to the 2001 census Christians were 27,185
 - 2011 main 50,353 ho gai Like other communities, Christians have migrated to Haryana
 khaas baat ye he ki jab aabaadi hi kam ho to usamen hone vaali vruddhi pratishat ke taur par kaafii badi lagati he
 In Haryana itself, the population of Hindus has increased by 35 lakh 15 thousand and the population of Sikhs has increased by 73 thousand
 isliye janaganana ke aankadon ko hameshaa hindu banaam musalmaan ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie varna ham or aap nayaa kya janenge nayaa kya kahenge
 John Dayal has written that in Christian-dominated Nagaland, 2 in the population of Christians
 83% kii giravat ai he
 The Sangh books state that Nagaland is a state where the plurality of Christians is becoming a threat to India's security
 musalamaanon kii aabaadi kam hui he iske baad bhi puure desh kii aabaadi badhane kii ausat dar se kaaphi zyaada he
 Accordingly, the speed of the population of all Hindus and Muslims should be reduced
 lekin rashtriya ausat se 7 fisadi adhik raftaar kya vaaki musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke prati shaq paidaa karti he
 If she does, what are they suspicious about
 kyon hai
 This issue has always been serious for the RSS
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki dash main ek jansankhya niti honi chahie
 a two-child policy should be implemented for all and there should be improvement within Muslims
 is par vistaar se baat karenge
 The comments kyon vipakshi dalon ko lagata he ki iske zariye dharmik dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 It is related to Bihar elections
 jaise dhruvikaran ke aujaar kam pad gaye hon
 Is it because the figures have been leaked earlier also? kuch hindu agar muslaanon kii aabaadi ko kisi duusari nazar se dekhte hai to hindu apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhte hai
 Will Muslims be afraid of the large population of Hindus as some people scare Hindus when their population increases
 musalmaan apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhtaa he
 How to look
 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai
 Not from religion
 lekin badhane kaa aankada aate hi dharm kaaran ho jaataa he
 We will also talk about whether the population grows at the speed of producing children
 navjaat mrityu dar yaa lambey samay tak jivan kaa bhi koi role he
 It is a very complex subject
 pichhali baar prime time kiya tha to meri ek baat ko lekar whatsap main abhi tak afvaah failaai gayi
 Beware of such gangs
 - dharm kaa siyaasi data, chunaav se pehle janaganana ke aankade, muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi (navabharat times) - Hindus decreased, Muslims increased (population) - aabaadi main muslamon kii hissedari 0
 Hindus increased by 8%, 0
 7% ghati (dainik bhaskar) - Sikhs, Buddhists also decreased, Christians and Jains were ineffective - ausat vruddhi dar se zyaada he muslimon kii badhat - Statistics will become a big issue in Bihar elections dainik bhaskar ne ek chote se box main yah bhi bataaya ki agar hindu musalmaan kii aabaadi maujuuda dar se badhati rahi to donon ko barabaar hone main 270 lag jaayenge yani 2285 main aisa hote hote bharat kii aabaadi 13,000 karod ho jaaegi
 Similarly, the scroll news site has also written that for 100 years it is being intimidated that one day Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 aisa hone ke liye maujuuda dar se musalmaan kii aabaadi badhati rahi to 200 saal main musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 Then India's population will be 3,264 crore
 lagata he dainik bhaskar or scrol kaa calculator kuch alag he
 India's population from 13000 crores to 3,264 crores
 mujhe nahin lagata ki tab musalmaan bhi bahut khush honge ki dekhon ab ham itane honge nau ve haev no problem
 If you imagine, you will be scared
 hindu ke liye bhi or musalmaan ke liye bhi
 Man will run over man
 khayr
 Let's see some more newspapers
 - badi muslim hissedari (dainik jaagran) - Population speed: Hindus slow, Muslims fast (amar Ujala) - aisa pehali baar hua ki hinduon kii aabaadi 80% se neeche ai - By the year 2050 there will be 180 crore Hindus and 41 crore Muslims - amar ujaalaa ke hisaab se to agle 35 saal tak musalmaan hinduon ke aadhe bhi nahin pahunch paayenge
 So relax rumor gangs
 hindustan akhbaar kii surkhiyaan hai - Muslim population grew fastest - muslimon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 Increased 8% - hinduon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 7% decrease - sabhi hindi akhabaaron main is baat par jor rahaa ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Whereas according to Hindu newspaper, the truth is that the growth rate of population in Muslims has fallen faster than the rest
 di vir main chitra padmanabhan ne likhaa he ki sensos ke aankadon ko sensex kii tarah nahin padhaa janaa chahie
 Like Muslim up Hindu down
 1991-2001 or 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar 29
 24 down from 5
 6 par ai he
 Well done Hindus should also get it
 unki aabaadi kii badhane kii raftaar 19
 16 minus 9 percent
 8 pratishat hui he
 Does the bulk of the media think about Muslims in the same way
 bharat sarkaar kii press relise main or bhi aankaden hai lekin ve shaayad dhyaan aakarshith nahin karte hai
 a newspaper also wrote that Muslims are ahead of Hindus in saving daughters
 - 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon main ling anupaat ek hazaar purushon par 951 he
 At the same time, the sex ratio among Hindus has reached 939 per thousand males
 - haalanki hinduon main sudhaar hua he magar rashtriya ausat 940 se ek kam he
 - Sex ratio among Muslims is 11 more than the national average
 ham sabhi ke bas kii baat nahin he ki aankadon ko baarik nigaah se dekh saken
 Therefore, it is said that many of us accept it when it is not
 angrezi akhbaaron ne is masale ko kaise cover kiya or unki kya hedline thi is par nazar daalate hai
 First the Times of India will then see the headline of Hindustan Times
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all Communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down Although TV should also have been mentioned, but the headlines of the previous days of the channels are not available
 angrezi ke donon bade akhabaaron ne bhi muslim aabaadi badhane ko aage rakhaa
 The headlines of The Indian Express and The Hindu were different, see the Indian Express earlier
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population slows growth - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - mail today ne likhaa ki Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 Told many newspaper headlines so that you can consider how our media society views the news related to Hindu Muslim
 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he
 - 85 in Christian population in Haryana
 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come
 - 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik isai 27,185 the
 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new
 jaan dayaal ne likhaa he ki isai bahul nagaland main to isaayiyon kii aabaadi main 2
 Declined by 83%
 sangh kii kitaaben kahati hai ki nagaland aisa rajya he jahaan isaayiyon kii bahulata bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatara ban rahi he
 Even after the Muslim population has decreased, the population of the entire country is much higher than the average rate of increase
 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population
 agar karti he to ve shaq kya hai
 Why are aresas ke liye yah mudda hameshaa se gambhir rahaa he
 The Sangh believes that there should be a population policy in Dash
 sabhi ke liye do bachche kii niti lagu ho or musalamaanon ke bheetar sudhaar ho
 We will talk about this in detail
 tippaniyan Why do the opposition parties think that it will try to polarize the religious
 bihar chunaav se iskaa taalluk he
 As polarization tools have fallen short
 kya is vajah se ki pehle bhi ye aankade li kiye ja chuke hai
 If some Hindus look at the population of Muslims from another point of view, then how do Hindus see the question of population within themselves
 musalmaan hinduon kii adhik aabaadi ke bare main kya vaise hi darataa hoga jaise uski aabaadi badhane par kuch log hinduon ko daraate hai
 How does a Muslim see the question of population within himself
 kaise dekhnaa chahie
 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he
 But as soon as the figure of increase comes, religion becomes the reason
 is par bhi baat karenge ki kya aabaadi bachche paidaa karne kii raftaar se hi badhati he
 There is also a role of neonatal mortality or prolonged life
 bahut jatil vishay he
 Last time i did prime time, so far rumors were spread in whatsapp regarding one of my things
 aise girohon se saavdhaan rahiye
 Dainik Bhaskar also told in a small box that if the Hindu Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, it would take 270 to equalize, which means that by 2285, India will have a population of 13,000 crores
 isi tarah scrol news site ne bhi likhaa he ki 100 saal se daraaya ja rahaa he ki ek din musalmaan hinduon ke baraabar ho jaaenge
 For this to happen, if the Muslim population continues to grow at the current rate, then in 200 years, Muslims will become equal to Hindus
 tab bharat kii aabaadi 3,264 karod hogi
 The calculator of Dainik Bhaskar and scroll seems to be different
 13000 karod se lekar 3,264 karod bharat kii aabaadi
 i do not think even then the Muslims will be very happy that now we will be so much now we have no problem
 aap kalpana kiijie to dar lagegaa
 For Hindus as well as for Muslims
 aadmi ke upar aadmi chalaa karegaa
 Anyway kuch or akhbaar dekhte hai
 - Increased Muslim share (dainik Jagran) - aabaadi kii raftaar : hinduon kii dhimi, muslimon kii tej (amar ujaalaa) - It was the first time that the population of Hindus came down below 80% - varsh 2050 tak 180 karod hindu or 41 karod muslim honge According to Amar Ujala, for the next 35 years, even half of the Hindus will not be able to reach
 so afvaah failaane vaale giroh relax karen
 Hindustan newspaper headlines are - muslim aabaadi sabase tej badi - Muslims share in the population 0
 8% badi 0 - The share of Hindus in the population
 7% ghati - In all Hindi newspapers, it was emphasized that the population of Muslims is increasing rapidly
 jabaki hindu akhbaar ke mutabik sachai ye he ki musalamaanon main aabaadi kii vikaas dar baakiyon ke mukaable sabase tej giri he
 In The Wire, Chitra Padmanabhan has written that census figures should not be read like the Sensex
 jaise musalmaan ap hindu down
 The pace of growth of Muslim population between 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 29
 5 se ghatakar 24
 Has arrived at 6
 shaabaashi hinduon ko bhi milani chahie
 The growth rate of their population 19
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 16
 8 percent
 kya media kaa bada hissaa musalamaanon ke bare main ek hi tarah se sochataa he
 There are more figures in the press releases of the Government of India but they probably do not attract attention
 ek akhbaar ne likhaa bhi ki beti bachaane main hinduon se aage hai musalmaan
 - Between 2001-2011, the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 for one thousand men
 - isi dauraan hinduon main ling anupaat prati hazaar purushon par 939 par pahunchaa he
 - Though Hindus have improved, the national average is one less than 940
 - musalamaanon main ling anupaat rashtriya ausat se 11 zyaada he
 It is not a matter of all of us to be able to look at the data closely
 isliye jaisaa bataaya jaataa he hamamen se kai log vaisaa maan lete hai jabaki vaisaa hota nahin he
 Let's look at how the English newspapers covered the issue and what their headline was
 pehle times of india phir uske baad hindustan times kii hedline dekhenge
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down vaise tivi kaa bhi zikr hona chahie tha magar channelon ke pichley dinon ke hedline milte nahin hai

 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai
 Not from religion
 lekin badhane kaa aankada aate hi dharm kaaran ho jaataa he
 We will also talk about whether the population grows at the speed of producing children
 navjaat mrityu dar yaa lambey samay tak jivan kaa bhi koi role he
 It is a very complex subject
 pichhali baar prime time kiya tha to meri ek baat ko lekar whatsap main abhi tak afvaah failaai gayi
 Beware of such gangs
 - amar ujaalaa ke hisaab se to agle 35 saal tak musalmaan hinduon ke aadhe bhi nahin pahunch paayenge
 So relax rumor gangs
 hindustan akhbaar kii surkhiyaan hai - Muslim population grew fastest - muslimon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 Increased 8% - hinduon kii jansankhya main hissedari 0
 7% decrease - sabhi hindi akhabaaron main is baat par jor rahaa ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Whereas according to Hindu newspaper, the truth is that the growth rate of population in Muslims has fallen faster than the rest
 di vir main chitra padmanabhan ne likhaa he ki sensos ke aankadon ko sensex kii tarah nahin padhaa janaa chahie
 Like Muslim up Hindu down
 1991-2001 or 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar 29
 24 down from 5
 6 par ai he
 Well done Hindus should also get it
 unki aabaadi kii badhane kii raftaar 19
 16 minus 9 percent
 8 pratishat hui he
 Does the bulk of the media think about Muslims in the same way
 bharat sarkaar kii press relise main or bhi aankaden hai lekin ve shaayad dhyaan aakarshith nahin karte hai
 a newspaper also wrote that Muslims are ahead of Hindus in saving daughters
 - 2001-2011 ke bich musalamaanon main ling anupaat ek hazaar purushon par 951 he
 At the same time, the sex ratio among Hindus has reached 939 per thousand males
 - haalanki hinduon main sudhaar hua he magar rashtriya ausat 940 se ek kam he
 - Sex ratio among Muslims is 11 more than the national average
 ham sabhi ke bas kii baat nahin he ki aankadon ko baarik nigaah se dekh saken
 Therefore, it is said that many of us accept it when it is not

 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he
 - 85 in Christian population in Haryana
 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come
 - 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik isai 27,185 the
 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new
 jaan dayaal ne likhaa he ki isai bahul nagaland main to isaayiyon kii aabaadi main 2
 Declined by 83%
 sangh kii kitaaben kahati hai ki nagaland aisa rajya he jahaan isaayiyon kii bahulata bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatara ban rahi he
 Even after the Muslim population has decreased, the population of the entire country is much higher than the average rate of increase
 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population
 agar karti he to ve shaq kya hai
 Why are aresas ke liye yah mudda hameshaa se gambhir rahaa he
 The Sangh believes that there should be a population policy in Dash
 sabhi ke liye do bachche kii niti lagu ho or musalamaanon ke bheetar sudhaar ho
 We will talk about this in detail
 tippaniyan Why do the opposition parties think that it will try to polarize the religious
 bihar chunaav se iskaa taalluk he
 As polarization tools have fallen short
 kya is vajah se ki pehle bhi ye aankade li kiye ja chuke hai
 If some Hindus look at the population of Muslims from another point of view, then how do Hindus see the question of population within themselves
 musalmaan hinduon kii adhik aabaadi ke bare main kya vaise hi darataa hoga jaise uski aabaadi badhane par kuch log hinduon ko daraate hai
 How does a Muslim see the question of population within himself
 kaise dekhnaa chahie
 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he
 But as soon as the figure of increase comes, religion becomes the reason
 is par bhi baat karenge ki kya aabaadi bachche paidaa karne kii raftaar se hi badhati he
 There is also a role of neonatal mortality or prolonged life
 bahut jatil vishay he
 Last time i did prime time, so far rumors were spread in whatsapp regarding one of my things
 aise girohon se saavdhaan rahiye
 - In all Hindi newspapers, it was emphasized that the population of Muslims is increasing rapidly
 jabaki hindu akhbaar ke mutabik sachai ye he ki musalamaanon main aabaadi kii vikaas dar baakiyon ke mukaable sabase tej giri he
 In The Wire, Chitra Padmanabhan has written that census figures should not be read like the Sensex
 jaise musalmaan ap hindu down
 The pace of growth of Muslim population between 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 29
 5 se ghatakar 24
 Has arrived at 6
 shaabaashi hinduon ko bhi milani chahie
 The growth rate of their population 19
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 16
 8 percent
 kya media kaa bada hissaa musalamaanon ke bare main ek hi tarah se sochataa he
 There are more figures in the press releases of the Government of India but they probably do not attract attention
 ek akhbaar ne likhaa bhi ki beti bachaane main hinduon se aage hai musalmaan
 - Between 2001-2011, the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 for one thousand men
 - isi dauraan hinduon main ling anupaat prati hazaar purushon par 939 par pahunchaa he
 - Though Hindus have improved, the national average is one less than 940
 - musalamaanon main ling anupaat rashtriya ausat se 11 zyaada he
 It is not a matter of all of us to be able to look at the data closely
 isliye jaisaa bataaya jaataa he hamamen se kai log vaisaa maan lete hai jabaki vaisaa hota nahin he
 Let's look at how the English newspapers covered the issue and what their headline was
 pehle times of india phir uske baad hindustan times kii hedline dekhenge
 - Muslim share of population up 0
 8%, Hindus' down 0
 7% - Muslim population grows 24% but slower than last decade - Numbers growing slower for all communities - Hindu proportion of India's population less than 80% - Decadal growth rate of Muslims slowing down vaise tivi kaa bhi zikr hona chahie tha magar channelon ke pichley dinon ke hedline milte nahin hai
 Both the big English newspapers also kept the Muslim population growing
 indian express or da hindu kii surkhiyaan alag thim pehle indian express dekhte hai
 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population growth slows - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - Mail Today wrote that Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 kai akhabaaron kii surkhiyon ke bare main isliye bataaya taaki aap gaur kar saken ki hamaara media samaaj hindu muslim se judi khabaron ko kaise dekhtaa he
 On the scroll website, Jan Dayal has seen one aspect of these figures from his perspective
 - haryana main isai aabaadi main 85
 An increase of 22 percent has been reported
 - ab is aankade ko dekhte hi lagegaa haryana main jat gaye, isai aa gaye
 - According to the 2001 census Christians were 27,185
 - 2011 main 50,353 ho gai Like other communities, Christians have migrated to Haryana
 khaas baat ye he ki jab aabaadi hi kam ho to usamen hone vaali vruddhi pratishat ke taur par kaafii badi lagati he
 In Haryana itself, the population of Hindus has increased by 35 lakh 15 thousand and the population of Sikhs has increased by 73 thousand
 isliye janaganana ke aankadon ko hameshaa hindu banaam musalmaan ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie varna ham or aap nayaa kya janenge nayaa kya kahenge
 John Dayal has written that in Christian-dominated Nagaland, 2 in the population of Christians
 83% kii giravat ai he
 The Sangh books state that Nagaland is a state where the plurality of Christians is becoming a threat to India's security
 musalamaanon kii aabaadi kam hui he iske baad bhi puure desh kii aabaadi badhane kii ausat dar se kaaphi zyaada he
 Accordingly, the speed of the population of all Hindus and Muslims should be reduced
 lekin rashtriya ausat se 7 fisadi adhik raftaar kya vaaki musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke prati shaq paidaa karti he
 If she does, what are they suspicious about
 kyon hai
 This issue has always been serious for the RSS
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki dash main ek jansankhya niti honi chahie
 a two-child policy should be implemented for all and there should be improvement within Muslims
 is par vistaar se baat karenge
 The comments kyon vipakshi dalon ko lagata he ki iske zariye dharmik dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 It is related to Bihar elections
 jaise dhruvikaran ke aujaar kam pad gaye hon
 Is it because the figures have been leaked earlier also? kuch hindu agar muslaanon kii aabaadi ko kisi duusari nazar se dekhte hai to hindu apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhte hai
 Will Muslims be afraid of the large population of Hindus as some people scare Hindus when their population increases
 musalmaan apane bheetar aabaadi ke sawaal ko kaise dekhtaa he
 How to look
 aabaadi badhane kaa sambandh garibi se hai

 - Hindus dip below to 80% of population: Muslim share up, slows down - Muslim Population slows growth - Gap with Hindu growth rate narrows - Bihar elections among factors in data release - mail today ne likhaa ki Hindu rate of Growth Falls
 Told many newspaper headlines so that you can consider how our media society views the news related to Hindu Muslim
 scrol website par jaan dayaal ne apni nazar se in aankadon ke ek pahalu ko dekha he
 - 85 in Christian population in Haryana
 22 pratishat kii vruddhi bataai gai he
 Now, seeing this figure, Jats will come to Haryana, Christians come
 - 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik isai 27,185 the
 - increased to 50,353 in 2011 - anya samudaayon kii tarah isai bhi palaayan kar haryana aae hai
 The special thing is that when the population is small, the increase in it seems to be quite large as a percentage
 haryana main hi hinduon kii aabaadi 35 lakh 15 hazaar badi he or sikhon kii aabaadi 73 hazaar badi he
 Therefore, the census data should not always be viewed through the prism of Hindu versus Muslim or else we will know what is new and what is new
 jaan dayaal ne likhaa he ki isai bahul nagaland main to isaayiyon kii aabaadi main 2
 Declined by 83%
 sangh kii kitaaben kahati hai ki nagaland aisa rajya he jahaan isaayiyon kii bahulata bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatara ban rahi he
 Even after the Muslim population has decreased, the population of the entire country is much higher than the average rate of increase
 kaayade se hindu muslim sabhi kii aabaadi kii raftaar kam honi chahie
 But is the 7 per cent higher than the national average really raises doubts about the Muslim population
 agar karti he to ve shaq kya hai
 Why are aresas ke liye yah mudda hameshaa se gambhir rahaa he
 The Sangh believes that there should be a population policy in Dash
 sabhi ke liye do bachche kii niti lagu ho or musalamaanon ke bheetar sudhaar ho
 We will talk about this in detail
 tippaniyan Why do the opposition parties think that it will try to polarize the religious
 bihar chunaav se iskaa taalluk he
 As polarization tools have fallen short
 kya is vajah se ki pehle bhi ye aankade li kiye ja chuke hai
 If some Hindus look at the population of Muslims from another point of view, then how do Hindus see the question of population within themselves
 musalmaan hinduon kii adhik aabaadi ke bare main kya vaise hi darataa hoga jaise uski aabaadi badhane par kuch log hinduon ko daraate hai
 How does a Muslim see the question of population within himself
 kaise dekhnaa chahie
 Increasing population is related to poverty
 dharm se nahin he
 But as soon as the figure of increase comes, religion becomes the reason
 is par bhi baat karenge ki kya aabaadi bachche paidaa karne kii raftaar se hi badhati he
 There is also a role of neonatal mortality or prolonged life
 bahut jatil vishay he
 Last time i did prime time, so far rumors were spread in whatsapp regarding one of my things
 aise girohon se saavdhaan rahiye

 The Karnataka High Court, according to the order of the Supreme Court, reserved judgment on the matter, as the DMK had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court questioning the appointment of government lawyer Bhawani Singh

 The matter was going on in the Karnataka High Court, but Bhavani Singh was appointed by the Tamil Nadu government, to which the DMK objected
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki bhavani singh kii niyukti kaanoon kii maryaadaaon ke khilaaf he or sahi nahin he, lekin saath hi saath yah bhi kaha ki is vajah se dobaaraa is maamle main sunwaayee kii zarurat nahi he
 That is, before May 12, the Karnataka High Court will give its verdict in this case, because Jayalalithaa's bail will end on this day

 'if this argument of Facebook is correct, then this data leak can pose a big threat to the privacy of a common user

 ek student ke sawaal par ki mahabuuba ke sir main jun bhi to ho sakati he
 The professor said that she is a lover of Ghalib, not yours
 jab tulsidas ke mehboob ram ho sakate hai to maine sochaa ki meri maa hi meri mehboob hogi
 i have been trying to write on this for the last 45 years
 jo meri aukaat rahi maine koshish kii
 - In this way she washes my sins, mother is more angry then she cries
 shahar main mushaayare ke vakt maa khush hoti thim
 Earlier people used to go to Mushayars for learning and learning
 ve ek vakya sunaate hai
 In a post-mortem house or hospital, the mother recognizes her child with prostration instead of touching her body
 chaahe andhera kitna bhi ho maa apane bachche ko peshaani se pahchaan leti he
 He recounts an incident with Hazrat Musa that when Musa is walking, people scoff at Moses for not doing it
 ab to teri maa bhi nahin he jisaki duaae tuje bachaa liya karti thim
 Earlier we used to consider Ganga, Jamuna, Saraswati or cow as mother
 ab gaay kii jagah maaruti khadi karne lage hai
 Earlier we used to consider cow as mother, now mother is considered as cow
 main ek old age home ko gira dena hi apni uplabdhi maanoonga
 On one hand, the mother has such a big status, on the other hand, quarrels are the strength of the mother and mother for sisters and sisters that there is no quarrel when the mother of Ambani brothers is present
 meraa yah maananaa he ki agar nehru or jinna kii maanen jinda hotin to yah bantwaaraa hi nahin hota
 There is no border, it is not a corridor, if the mother was in the middle, then it would not have been divided who would tie the belt with a wish on someone's wound, if there are no sisters, then who will tie the rakhi, we are old and important in your festivals, if we are not there only then Who wore the turban, touched the biggest mark of the bulls, raised the mother in the lap then touched the sky, on the question of her knee being opened six times, they say that the knee is also Area to be opened so often, but his eyes are fine today
 main aasaani se pard letaa hum
 Life will go on, despite the power, kiss the mother's eyes, the light will grow, it does not tell good to keep the light, no one tells the poison to be sweet, only saw herself in the eyes of the mother, this mirror does not tell us the old where clothes
 But used to take care there, now we go with medicine
 kya pataa vahaan mili na mili
 When i get out of the house, my prayers go with me, my mother is still alive, i will have nothing but helplessness makes every city tumbling, sometimes making a naxal, sometimes making chambal is a matter but who can explain the wind, from the given My mother makes mascara for me
 Whose person stays for a long time, a very tall building is always in danger every time
 Very well, i think we can get out of the prison, i remember you too but in this rubble She lives

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has apologized to the countrymen for the early exit of the team from the Twenty20 World Cup, admitting that it was his mistake to send Ravinder Jadeja ahead of Yuvraj Singh in the Super Eight stage match against England
 ham khud ko sabit karengellards par ravivaarrat teen ran se haar ke baad niraash dhoni ne kaha ki ham aapse bhi zyada niraash he
 We value the feelings of our fans and countrymen
 hamane apana sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya or yah ham khule dil se kah rahe hai
 We are not hiding anything
 nau maheene baad phir twanti20 vishwa cap hoga or usamen ham khud ko sabit karenge
 Dhoni sent Jadeja to bat before Yuvraj and himself, who played 35 balls to make 25 runs
 isse bich ke overon main duusare ballebaajon par dabaav ban gaya or bharat teen ran se match harkar toornament se baahar ho gaya
 Dhoni said many times you do not know what will happen
 hamen laga ki jadeja pari ko sthirataa dene ke saath aakraamak shaat bhi khelegaa
 He tried but could not succeed
 yah tarkeeb kargar sabit nahin hui
 Ravinder Jadeja's decision to play Sahidhoni, however, justified his decision to field Jadeja by replacing Pragyan Ojha and winning the toss
 unhone kaha ki ham aisa sangyojan talash rahe the jisase ballebaaji ko gaharaai mil sake
 We also needed a good performance from the lower order
 ojha acha gendbaaj he lekin jadeja behtareen fielder or harfanmaulaa he
 It also helped us to include an extra fast bowler
 dhoni ne kaha jahaan tak pehle kshetrarakshan kaa sawaal he to hamen laga ki kritrim roshni main wicket ballebaaji ke liye behatar hoga
 The Indian captain blamed his batsmen for the defeat and said that no excuse can be made for not achieving the target of 154 runs
 unhone kaha ham ballebaaji main naakaam rahe
 If the opposing team has scored 153 runs and we have not been able to achieve it on this wicket, then i do not think any argument can be given for this
 unhone kaha ham isaliye haare kyonki hamane acchhee ballebaaji nahin kii
 i am happy with the performance of the bowlers
 shortpich gendon se england ke ballebaaj havidhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki england ke gendbaaj apni shortpich gendon ke jariye bhartiya ballebaajon par haaavee ho gaye the
 He said the England bowlers started aggressively and used the bouncers well
 hamaare ballebaaj apni ranneeti achaanak nahin badal sake
 i will be back soon
 Regarding his form, Dhoni admitted that he is not able to play aggressive innings but then he is working very hard to play big shots with his bat
 unhone kaha main lagaataar chakke nahin laga paa rahaa
 i am working hard but this game is not just about hitting sixes
 ummid he ki main jaldi vaapasi karuunga
 Dhoni denied that playing cricket continuously for the last six months had an impact on the team's performance
 unhone kaha main iskaa bahaanaa nahin banaaungaa
 i don't blame the IPL either
 koi yah nahin kah saktaa ki meri team yaa maine maichon main shat pratishat yogadan nahin diya
 If anyone says that, i will feel very bad
 karier kii sabase kharaab haar nahindhoni ne is haar ko apane karier kii sabase kharaab haar nahin mana or naa hi vah ye maanate hai ki isse bharat main cricket par bura asar padegaa
 He said i do not think it will have any bad effect in India
 ham 2007 vishwa cap se bhi baahar ho gaye the or vah sabase kharaab haar thi
 But we bounced back and won consecutive series
 ram mandir ke liye masjid kaa daawa chhodane ke evaj main paanch hajaar karod rupee kii deal ke aarope maamle main art of living kii ore se safai di gai he
 The institute on Thursday denied being aware of any such deal
 darasal, buudhvaar ko ram janmabhumi sadbhaavna samiti ke adhyaksh or shrishri ravishankar ke sabase kareebi amarnath mishra ne aarope lagaaya tha ki ol india muslim personal lau board (AIMPLB) ke agxcutive member rahe moulana salmaan nadvi masjid kaa daawa chhodane ke evaj main paanch hajaar karod rupee kii deal chaahate the
 On Thursday, a statement issued by the Art of Living said that if there was a conversation between Amarnath Mishra and Maulana Salman Nadvi on February 5 to give up the mosque claim, they were not aware of it
 buudhvaar yani 14 farvari ko amarnath mishra ne is babat media main bayaan dene ke baad phone par isaki jaankaree di
 We will find out the reality of their complaints
 art of living ne kaha gaya ki jahaan tak moulana nadvi se baatcheet kaa maamla he, to unhone aisi koi maang nahin kii he
 Some people are busy derailing the process of resolving the Ram temple issue and creating mistrust
 maaloom ho ki buudhvaar ko amarnath mishra ne salmaan nadvi par bada aarope lagaaya tha
 Mishra said that Nadvi wanted a deal of five thousand crore rupees in lieu of leaving the mosque claim
 ram janmabhumi sadbhaavna samiti ke adhyaksh or shrishri ravishankar ke sabase kareebi amarnath mishra ne aarope lagaaya ki jis formule ko lekar salmaan nadvi or sunni central board ke adhyaksh shrishri ravishankar se milane gaye the
 Behind that formula was the preparation for a big deal
 amarnath mishra ne kaha ki yah formula darasal unka tha, jo unhone paanch farvari kosalman nadvior duusare muslim netaaon ko diya tha, lekin usee mulaakaat ke dauraan salmaan nadvi ne is deal kii evaj main paanch hajaar karod rupee, ayodhya main 200 acre jameen or rajyasabha kii ek seat maangi thi
 According to Amarnath Mishra, this was done to him so that this matter of Nadvi could be conveyed to the big people associated with the construction of the temple, the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister and somehow the deal could be confirmed
 mishra ne khaas baatcheet main ajtak ko bataaya tha ki dil kii yah baat sabhi bade netaaon ko bataa di gai he
 Even Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is known
 mishra ne kaha tha ki mandir nirmaan ke out of court setlement kaa formula lekar muslim personal lau board ke kai sadasyon ke paas gaye the
 He also gave this formula to Salman Nadvi, so that it could be discussed in the meeting of the Muslim Personal Law Board, Salman Nadvi also gave assurance of this discussion to Amarnath Mishra
 mishra ne daawa kiya tha ki is maamle par board main charchaa karne ke bajaesalmaan nadviis formule ko lekar sidhe shrishri ravishankar ke paas chale gaye the or vahaan se unhone is formule kaa elaan kar diya tha
 According to Amarnath Mishra, he did not know whether the deal was made with Shree Ravi Shankar or not, but it was done to him and he has strong evidence

 - input IANS Demonetisation is exactly the same as shooting at the wheel of a high speed racing car in a fast running economy
 yah kahana he zyaan drez kaa
 Zyan Dreze, an economist by profession and a member of the National Advisory Council during his UPA tenure, said in an interview to a business newspaper that the demonetisation decision is creating a terrible situation for those who are below the poverty line
 zyaan drez kaa maananaa he ki yah kadam vipakshi dalon ko nishaanaa saadh kar uthaaya gaya he
 An ongoing debate on demonetisation dominates the illusion that it will directly affect the black money in the economy
 kaledhan ko nikaalkar baahar phenkane, shadow iconomi ko kuchalane or parelal iconomi ke khilaaf sargical strike karne ke bade-bade daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 These claims are being made by the government and people standing in its favor to justify demonetisation
 kaha ja saktaa he ki yah daawey kaledhan ke us sanchay siddhant par aadhaarit he jiske mutabik jahaan kaledhan kaa dher ho vah swat: badhata rahata he lihaaja use saaf karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 This theory is completely wrong
 kalaadhan rakhana vaala dhoort vyakti apni kaali kamai ke cash ko suutakes main bharkar rakhane se behatar tareeke jaanata he
 He spends his black earnings, invests and converts the cash into another form
 vah sampatti kharid letaa he, mahangi shaadiyon par uda detaa he, dubai main shopping karata he yaa netaaon ko khush karne ke liye kharch kar detaa he
 However, it is also true that at any given time, some black money may have been lying in the kitchen compartment or pillow shell
 lekin is bache-khuche kaledhan ko baahar nikaalane kii kavayad kuch usee tarah he ki aap kamare main shower chalaakar pochha lagaaein
 Hence, calling this move a surgical strike against black money is merely an illusion
 duniyabar ke kai arthshaastri yah tark saamne rakh chuke hai lekin sarkaar ko apana hi dhol suhaavna lag rahaa he
 Political parties probably perform the task of storing black money
 unke liye yah taarkik he kibadi maatra main cashekatrit kare jisase chunaav prachaar ke kaam ko sahaj kiya ja sake
 Opposition parties are the main targets of demonetisation
 sattarudh dal par iskaa kam asar hoga
 Although John Dreze says that he is strongly against the frauds perpetrated by political parties, but believes that this method is not appropriate to correct political parties

 President Ramnath Kovind said that this is a time of the year when the air quality of many cities including the capital Delhi has deteriorated
 unhone kaha ki ham sab ek aisi chunauti kaa saamana kar rahe hai jo pehle kabhi nahin rahi
 At the Conference of Directors of iits, nits and iists held at Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Kovind said, 'many scientists and prophets have spoken of the end of the world (doomsday)
 hamaare shaharon main aajkal dhundh jaisi sthitiyon ko dekhakar yah dar sataane laga he ki bhavishya ke liye kahi yah baat kahin abhi hi sach nahin ho jaae
 'pollution in the Parliament was widely discussed in the Lok Sabha in the Parliament
 is dauraan congress saansad manish tiwari ne kaha ki dilli kii aabhohawaa itani zyada pradooshit ho jaati he, itnaa zyada dhuaan ho jaataa he ki log jahrili gas kii saans lete hai
 He said that 14 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world are from India
 tiwari ne yah bhi kaha ki aisa nahin he ham is samasya se nipat nahin sakate
 Beijing is the biggest example of this
 agar beijing kii hawa saaf ho sakati he to yahaan kyon nahin
 At the same time, the TMC MP put forward his speech by wearing a mask
 tiemasi saansad kakoli ghosh ne kaha ki kya svachh bharat jaisaa mishan svachh hawa ke liye nahin ho saktaa
 He said that the government should take this matter seriously and should make this a national mission so that the coming generations can get clean air
 dilli purv seat se bijepi saansad gautam gambhir ne bhi apni baat rakhi
 He said that 1 child dies every three minutes due to air pollution
 hamen shortkat ke bajaay log-turm samaadhaan par sochna chahie nahin to hamaare bacchon ko isaki badi keemat chukaani hogi
 That means President Ramnath Kovind was also worried about the concern which was expressed in the Parliament
