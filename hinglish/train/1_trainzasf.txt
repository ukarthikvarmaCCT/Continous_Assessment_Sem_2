 This budget, which comes just two months before the election, will be interim

 It is also a tradition that the going government does not make any big policy announcement in this interim budget
 lekin sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya modi sarkaar parampara ko taak par rakhkar is antarim bajet yaa vot on acount main aane vaale chunaavon ke maddenjar bade elaan kar sakati he, taaki votaron ko lubhaaya ja sake? kuch aise elaan hai jinka lambey samay se intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 There is also a discussion about these within the government

 It is being said that the income tax exemption limit in the interim budget can be increased from 2

 After losing the government in three states, BJP has realized the resentment of farmers
 pradhanmantri modi karj maafee ko naakaafi bataa chuke hai
 In such a situation, it is believed that some new announcements for farmers can be made either in the interim budget or earlier
 isamen shunya byaaj dar par karj dena or do lakh rupye tak ke karj ke liye kuch bhi girvee na rakhana jaise upaay shaamil hai
 One option is to provide relief on the lines of the Rayat Bandhu of Telangana or the Kalia scheme of Odisha, in which small and medium farmers are given a fixed amount for seed-manure, per acre per crop, etc
 berozegaron ke liye bhi koi bada elaan sambhav he
 But amidst all these possibilities, the question is, will the Modi government really be able to open the treasury? The government itself targeted financial losses 3
 3% rakhaa he
 Collection in GST is less than expected
 sarkari companiyaan bhi nahin bik pain
 In such a situation, the challenge is to fulfill this goal
 ek taraf parampara kaayam rakhane kii chunauti he to duusari taraf satta main vaapasi kaa lakshya
 Many BJP leaders have started saying that what is the benefit of filling the treasury if another government comes and loots it
 isse acha he aap khajaana lutaa kar phir satta main aaen
 By the way, let me tell you that the previous government has been saved from the breathtaking announcement in the interim budget in the election year, but there are some exceptions

 Strong protests against the law of citizenship 'violation of the right to equality' The protests are going on across the country over the Citizenship Amendment Act
 dilli, aligarh, patna, bengalooru main joardaar pradarshan chal rahaa he
 The question is which provision of the citizenship law is the Muslim society demonstrating

 Muslims of these three countries are excluded from this scope
 uttar, purv or dakshin bharat main is kanoon ke isi pravaadhan ko lekar ugr virodh ho rahaa he
 Why is there opposition to the citizenship law? The first controversy is that this bill is against the Muslims, and secondly, how can it be decided according to religion that there is censorship, and who does not
 
 vipakshi partiyon or muslim sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki ye kanoon bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed-14 (samanta kaa adhikaar) kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he

 What is Citizenship Law 1955 Citizenship Law 1955 is a detailed law related to Indian citizenship
 is kanoon main vistaar se bataaya gaya he ki kisi shaks ko kin praavdhaanon ke aadhaar par bhartiya naagarikta kaise di ja sakati he or bhartiya naagarik hone ke liye kya-kya sharte hai
 According to this law, a person can be given citizenship of India in four ways
 is adhinium main ab tak paanch baar (1986, 1992, 2003, 2005 or 2015) badlaav kiya ja chukaa he
 Why protest in Assam? People opposing this bill in Assam say that the Citizenship Amendment Act violates the Assam Accord 1985
 is samjhaute ke mutabik 24 march 1971 se pehle hi duusare deshon se bharat aae logon ko bharat kii naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan he
 But according to the new law, this limit has been increased to 31 December 2014

 The Karnataka assembly election is being considered as the semifinal of 2019
 rajya kii siyaasi baaji jeetne ke liye congress or bijepi ne puri takat jhonk di he
 With the support of Siddaramaiah, the Congress is struggling to retain its power, while the BJP is trying to return to power again by putting forward the face of BS Yeddyurappa
 lekin karnataka kii siyasat ke sanyog kuch or kahani bayaan kar rahe hai
 The ruling party has not been able to consistently return to power in the state in the last 33 years
 itnaa hi nahin, 2013 ko chhodkar centre main sattarudh dal kabhi bhi rajya main bahumat hasil nahin kar saki
 In the political battleground of Karnataka assembly elections, there seems to be a contest between the Congress and the BJP
 1972 se pehle ise mysore rajya ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, lekin punarnamakaran kar iskaa naam karnataka kar diya gaya
 If we look at the political history of Karnataka for four decades, the Janata Party government was formed twice in 1983 and 1985
 iske baad se jab bhi vidhansabha chunaav hue hai, sattadhari party lagaataar duusari baar satta main vaapasi nahin kar saki
 The Congress won the fifth Assembly elections in 1972 and the sixth election in 1978, after Mysore was named Karnataka
 apatkaal ke baad1983 main hue rajya ke saatven vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii satta se vidaai hui or janata party kii sarkaar bani
 The Janata Party won 95 seats and Ramakrishna Hegde, along with other smaller parties, formed the first non-congress government in the state
 haalanki, ye sarkaar zyada din nahin chal saki
 Subsequently, in the 1985 elections, the Janata Party achieved a spectacular success with 139 seats
 ye vahi daur tha jab centre kii satta par indira gandhi ke netritv vaali congress kii sarkaar thi
 Despite this, his magic could not work in Karnataka and the state could not come to power
 1989 main karnataka ke saatven vidhansabha chunaav hue, janata party kii vidaai hui or congress ne jabardast jeet ke saath satta main vaapasi kii
 The record for winning the highest ever 178 seats in the history of the state, which no party has yet to break
 iske baad 1994 main vidhansabha chunaav hue main congress ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Janata Dal formed the government by winning 115 seats under the leadership of HD Deve Gowda
 jabaki centre kii satta main pi ve narsinghraav ke netritv main congress kii sarkaar thi
 Five years later, in the 1999 assembly elections, the Janata Dal had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of the Congress
 congress ne 132 siten jitkar rajya kii satta main vaapasi kii
 This was the same time when the BJP coalition under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the NDA government at the center
 2006 main hue vidhansabha main congress ko satta se baahar hona padaa
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 79 seats and the Congress got 65 seats
 congress ne jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai jo rajya kii pehali gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani
 At the same time, the Congress coalition government was in power at the Center
 iske baad jedies ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar banaaya or mukhyamantri kumaraswami bane
 The JD (S) assembly elections in 2008 had to face a crushing defeat
 bijepi 110 siton ke saath satta par virajman hui or siem kii kaman bies yediurppa ko mili
 BJP government was formed for the first time in South India
 2008 main centre main congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar thi
 Despite this, the Congress was reduced to just 80 seats
 paanch saal ke baad 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Whereas the Congress, with a majority of 122 seats, came to power
 1999 ke baad congress ne karnataka kii satta main vaapasi kii thi
 For the first time in the last three decades, the party in power at the center formed a government in the state
 karnataka kii siyasat 2018 main nai ibaarat likhegi yaa phir apana purana itihaas doharayegi
 Congress holds state power and BJP at center power

 a bench of Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly held that under these conditions the law allows the assailant to be killed and cannot be considered a crime of murder
 peeth ne kaha ‘‘kanoon kisi kaayda pasand insaan se aisi sthiti main jabaki uski jaan par ban aayi ho bujadili kii ummid nahin karata

 Darshan shot Gurcharan on seeing his father moving towards him after attacking him with a sharp weapon
 nichali adaalat ne ipisi ke praavdhaanon ke tahat yah mana ki darshan singh ne aatmaraksha main gurcharan kii jaan lee thi or use bari kar diya
 Later, on appeal against the verdict, the High Court overturned the judgment of the lower court and sentenced Darshan Singh to life imprisonment
 ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke khilaaf darshan kii apil par sheersh adaalat ne ipisi kii dhara 96 se dhara 106 kii vyakhya karte hue kaha ki is praavdhaan kaa sahaara un halaat main liya ja saktaa he jabaki kisi vyakti ko is baat kaa vaastavik andeshaa ho ki uskaa pratidwandi us par hamalaa karne ja rahaa he or is hamale se use gambhir shaareerik kshati pahunch sakati he
 "in such a situation, one can go to the extent of killing the assailant in self-defense," the bench said
 bhale hi us par koi prahaar na hua ho yaa use koi chot nahin pahunchi ho
 The court said that the question of how reasonable the threat was depends on the facts and circumstances of the case
 is silsile main koi tayshuda formula nahin banaaya ja saktaa

 Earlier, Pawar had written a letter to the CM and appealed to the government to take necessary steps for the most severe famine after 1972
 maharashtra ke 21 hajaar gaanv sookhe se jujh rahe hai, 151 tahseelon ko sarkaar suukhaagrast ghoshit kar chuki he
 There is a total of 16 per cent water left in the dams across the state, while Marathwada has only a quarter to five per cent water
 monsoon aane main lagbhag ek maheenaa bachaa he
 Opposition parties are accusing the Fadnavis government of failing to deal with the famine
 ye gaanv bhayankar sookhe kaa saamana kar rahemaharashtra ke kuch gaanv bhayankar sookhe kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 a village in Yavatmal district has become so infamous due to the drought that has been going on continuously for many years that no one is ready to give their girl here
 gaanv ke yuvaaon kii shaadiyaan nahin ho paa rahi hai
 People of Azanti village, located in Yavatmal district, have to walk 2-3 kilometers every day in search of water
 aise main gaanvnivaasiyon kaa adhikansh vakt pani kii suvidha karne me chalaa jaataa he
 The situation is that the youth do not even have time to go to work
 pani ke abhaav ke chalate yahaan yuvaaon kaa vivaah nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Yavatmal district of Maharashtra has not received enough rainfall for the last three-four years, due to which there is a famine-like situation in Yavatmal district today
 prashasan kareeb 755 gaanvon ko sukhagrast ghoshit kar chukaa he, lekin gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki sukha ghoshit karne ke alaava prashasan ne ab tak koi bhi thos kadam nahin uthaae hai, jisase logon ko pani kii is baari killat se chhootkaraa mil sake
 You can guess the water shortage in Yavatmal district by the fact that in many villages people have to come down to the wells for water
 yavatmal jile ke kai kisaanon ne ab apane pashuon ko aadhe daamon main bech diya he
 Due to this, now the income earned by the milk of the farmers has also completely stopped
 prashasan kii andekhi ke chalate aajanti gaanv ke nivasee lagaataar prashasan par aarope laga rahe he
 Disturbed by the drought, some villages in Maharashtra have started migrating towards the city, because the entire time of people goes many kilometers to fill water and they are unable to go on wages
 pine kii dikkat to he hi ghar main khaane ke bhi laale padane lag hai
 Something similar is in Varkhed Devdhari village in Akola district of Vidarbha

 The water level in the village has gone down
 gaanv main sirf ek handpump kaam kar rahaa he
 After spending hours trying it, a bucket of water comes
 zyaadaatar gaanv nivasee yahaan mazdooree karke ghar chalaate hai
 Villagers have to wander for a bucket of water for hours

 991 villages in Akola district are drought-hit, but only two villages receive water from a government tanker
 sunne se lagata he ki is gaanv ke log duusare gaanvon ke mukaable kitne bhaagyashaalee hai ki unhen paise dekar pani nahin khareednaa padataa
 But it is not so

 Where the flock of villagers break on the tanker after the government tanker arrives
 tanker kaa pani sidhe pipeline se gaanv ke sookhe kune main daalaa jaataa he
 After that, the struggle of the people for water starts, everyone's time is tied to get water

 But would you believe that the people of the village adjacent to Shirdi are yearning for water
 sthiti itani kharaab he ki yahaan ke log dinabhar gaanv main sthit borwell ke paas pani ke liye intjaar main baithe rahete hai
 Big people of the country reach the village of Kakdi, adjacent to Shirdi, in fact, Shirdi Airport is built on the land of this village and more than 1 lakh passengers come here every day, but this airport, built a year and a half ago, gave the people here their sorrow
 reminds me of
 is gaanv main 3,000 se zyada log rahete hai or inkaa kahana he ki maharashtra airport deveopment korporation se 24 ghante pani or naukari dene jaise vaade kiye gaye the, lekin in dinon kakdi gaanv itane bure haal se guzar rahaa he ki gaanv main maujuud ek sarkari borwell naa ke baraabar pani aata he
 The government has also provided facility of water tanker, but the tanker only comes once in 20 days
 isi vajah se is gaanv ke log ab subah shaam pani ke liye dar dar bhatak rahe hai
 The people of Kakri village yearning for water are not able to go to their jobs even, but the administration has remained silent on this condition of Kakri village

 Paresh Rawal takes a dig at Vivek Oberoi piem narendra modi kii byopic film kaa pehla luk poster haal hi main relies kiya gaya
 Actor Vivek Oberoi plays the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the film
 lekin kuch dinon pehle charchaa thi ki piem modi kaa kirdaar actor paresh rawal nibhaane vaale hai
 After the arrival of the new poster, it was speculated that Paresh Rawal had left the film
 lekin is baat par paresh rawal ne saare kanfusion dur kar die hai
 Paresh Rawal told in an interview that no one can play PM Modi better than him
 is tarah paresh rawal ne vivek oberoi kii casting par sawaal uthaa die hai
 It has also made it clear that two films are going to be made on PM Modi
 duusari film main khud paresh rawal piem modi kaa kirdaar nibhaayenge
 Let me tell you that Paresh Rawal had announced a film on Narendra Modi some time ago, but so far no talk about it could be moved because who would direct the film, it could not be decided
 paresh ne ab kaha he ki vah apni film banane ke plan par kaayam hai
 When asked if the second film on Prime Minister Modi directed by Umang Kumar could come before your film, he said that there are many such incidents in the life of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on which the film can be made
 kai saare log ise bana sakate he
 He told that he will show many such parts of Narendra Modi's life that people are unaware of

 i too know villages very well like Modi
 paresh rawal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif karte hue kaha ki ve bhi purv pradhanmantri bahadur shastri kii tarah eemaandaar he
 Life is unfair Dr Manmohan Singh got someone of the calibre of Anupam Kher
 Poor Modi ji has to settle for Vivek Oberoi
 Salman Khan hota toh kya maza aata
 — Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)january 8, 2019vivek oberoi kii casting par bole umr abdullavivek obray kaa piem modi ke kirdaar main pehla luk aane ke baad mila-jula rispance mil rahaa he
 Along with the audience, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has also quipped on Vivek's casting
 unhone twit kar likhaa- ''jindagi bhi kitni ajeeb he
 The role of Dr
 Manmohan Singh got Anupam Kher as a qualified artist
 garib modi ji ko vivek oberoi se samjhauta karnaa padaa
 What would have been fun if Salman Khan '' In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Narendra Modi registered a historic victory and formed the government at the Center
 iske baad puure desh main bhagava rang chadhataa chalaa gaya
 However, before coming to the center, the BJP government was in only 7 states, while at that time, the Congress ruling the country was ruling in 13 states
 lekin modi ko gaddi milte hi maano, congress kaa bura vakt shuru ho gaya
 Election-by-election, he continued to get bitter defeats
 jabaki duusari taraf bijepi ne jis mitti ko bhi chuaa vah sona ban gai
 The result was that the BJP, along with its allies at one time, reached the record of running the government simultaneously in 20 states
 lekin ab jabaki 2019 kaa loksabhaa saamne he, to halaat thode juda hai
 At the time of getting power in 2014, BJP had only 7 states
 inamen se 2 rajyon main uski gathbandhan sarkaar thi
 In Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Goa, the BJP was running the government on its own, while in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh it was running a coalition government
 duusari taraf congress 13 rajyon main shashan main thi
 In Himachal, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Jammu Kashmir and Kerala, the party was running governments on its own or in coalition
 centre main modi sarkaar ke baad chali bijepi kii lahar2014 main narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad haryana, maharashtra, jharkhand, andhra pradesh or jammu kashmir main bijepi ne apane dam yaa sahyogiyon ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai
 He formed a government in Sikkim with his help
 2016 main bijepi ne assam main itihaas rachaa or congress ke 15 saal ke shashan ko khatm kar diya
 After this, in 2017, there were assembly elections in 7 states, BJP formed governments in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, while Congress opened its account in Punjab
 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko chhattisgarh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh ke rup main apane bade rajya ganvaane pade or yahaan congress ne jeet darj kii
 Congress and JDS formed government in Karnataka
 jabaki tripura jaise left ke garh main bhi bijepi apana camel khilaane main kaamyaab rahi
 In the states of North East also, the BJP formed several governments with its cooperation
 yani 2017 tak bijepi kaa viyaji rath bina kisi avrodh ke chalata rahaa, lekin 2018 kii shuruyaat main jab karnataka main chunaav hue to congress ne jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai or apana graph sudhaarney kaa kaam kiya
 Things changed after that and in the end of 2018, the Congress overthrew the BJP in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 in teenon rajyon main mili jeet ne congress ko badi takat di
 Earlier this year, he withdrew his support from the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, thus leaving his government there
 ab maujuuda halaat ye hai ki piem narendra modi ne congress ke 'teen-p' yani punjab, puducheri or parivaar congress ko lekar jo tippanee kii thi, congress usase aage bad gai he
 That is, after Punjab and Puducherry, the Congress has been able to form governments in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as well
 yani congress ab paanch rajyon or sangh shasit rajya main sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Whereas bjp's graph has come down
 philhal, bijepi kii sarkaar 17 rajyon main he, jinamein se kuch rajyon main uski gathbandhan kii bhi sarkaar chal rahi hai
 In the current situation, BJP on its own or with allies in governance in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, UP and Uttarakhand
 is
 haalanki ye tasviir abhi loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane tak or badal sakati he, kyonki andhra pradesh, arunachal pradesh, sikkim or odisha main loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai
 However, in the current situation, it is no longer the responsibility of the BJP to cross the new government on the central government, but also in front of the bjp-ruled state governments, there is a big target to bring their party once again to the power of the center
 saath hi hindi pattee ke teen rajyon kii satta milane ke baad congress sarkaron par bhi loksabhaa chunaav main party kii buree sthiti se ubharne kii chunauti he
 The trend of trolling celebs on social media has become common these days
 haal hi main aisi hi koshish junior bachchan ke saath kii gai
 But he stopped speaking of the troller with his presence
 aakhirkaar unki ladli aradhya bachchan kii padhai or aishwarya pareinting par jo sawaal uthe the
 Actually, a woman on Twitter tagged Abhishek Bachchan and questioned his daughter's going to school
 saath hi unki patni aishwarya raay ko ghamandi tak kah daalaa
 Aishwarya was in short dress, so why was Abhishek furious at the photographer? The user lady tweeted and wrote, Abhishek Bachchan, doesn't your daughter go to school? i am surprised which school approves the child to go on a trip with Mom
 yaa aap log apni beti ko bina dimag vaali khubasurat mahila bananaa chaahate ho

 — Abhishek Bachchan (@juniorbachchan)december 4, 2017aksar aishwarya or aradhya ko lekar protective rahane vaale junior bachchan ko mahila kaa ye coment bilkul pasand nahin aayaa
 Giving a befitting reply to the woman, she wrote, 'mam, as far as i know, most schools are closed on weekends
 aradhya wyk days main skool jaati he
 You should probably do this in view of your spellings in this tweet

 vaise yah pehali baar nahin he jab abhishek ne aradhya or aishwarya kaa bachaav kiya ho
 a few days ago he took on the photographer for taking wrong photographs of Aishwarya

 The war of words between the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump continues, with Russia taking a dig at both leaders
 rus ke videsh mantri sergei lavarove ne kaha ki kim jong un or donald trump bacchon kii tarah lard rahe hai
 US President Donald Trump, in an earlier speech at the United Nations, warned of a complete dismantling of North Korea, to which North Korea countered his speech as a dog bark
 itnaa hi nahin, kim jong un ne donald trump ko pagal tak qaraar de diya he
 At the same time, Donald Trump has called the North Korean dictator even to Rocketman and Madman
 roosi videsh mantri ne donon deshon se tanaav karne ko kaha he
 He also said that silently watching North Korea's nuclear test is not acceptable, but starting a war on the Korean peninsula is also not acceptable
 vahiin, america ke raashtrapati donald trump kii ore se barbaad karne kii dhamkee ke jawaab menuttar koriake videsh mantri ne kaha ki vah prashanth mahaasaagar main hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan karne par vichaar kar sakate hai
 Condemning a speech given by the US President at the United Nations this week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un warned in response to 'take the most drastic step against any step in history'
 isi maheene kim ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kar duniya ko chintaa main daal diya tha
 North Korea claimed that it could be fired from a hydrogen bomb missile
 uttar korea ke videsh mantri ri yong-ho ne neuyork main media se baatcheet main bhavishya main or adhik shaktishaalee hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan karne kii baat kahi
 He said, 'I think there may be an unprecedented level of hydrogen bomb testing over the Pacific Ocean, but it depends on our leader Kim Jong
 lihaaja main is babat acchhee tarah nahin jaanata
 Analyst Chung Sung Un at the Korea Institute for National Unification said that there was a "very high possibility" that Kim could act in any further provocation
 baharhaal, abhi yah spasht nahin he kiuttar koriakya karegaa? chung ne kaha ki is baat kii sambhaavna he ki uttar korea uttari prashanth mahaasaagar main hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kar saktaa he
 He said that this would allow the US to potentially try to hit the rocket, while China could impose more stringent restrictions on it, which would be disastrous for the country facing the economic crisis
 pehle do test maichon main shandaar jeet darj karne vaale england ko ashes apane paas barkaraar rakhane ke liye ab wimbledon or shahi parivaar se jude mithkon ko apane khyal main bhi laane se bachanaa hoga
 England beat Australia by 14 runs in the first match played in Nottingham
 iske baad usne lords main duusare test match main 347 ran se shahi jeet darj kii
 Looking at Australia's batting batting, it is believed that England will be able to retain the Ashes, but if you look at some myths, then the path will not be easy
 inamen wimbledon se judaa myth kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Britain's Andy Murray has won the Wimbledon men's singles title this time
 unhone britain kaa 77 saal kaa intjaar samaapt kiya
 The last time before him was in 1936 Fred Parry won the Wimbledon title to Britain and that year England lost the Ashes 2-3 despite winning the first two matches
 peri ne bhi mare kii tarah teen set main jeet darj kii, lekin iske baad jo ashes kheli gai usamen england acchhee sthiti main hone ke baavjood haar gaya tha
 England won the first Test in Brisbane by 322 runs and the second match in Sydney by an innings and 22 runs
 australia ne haalanki shandaar vaapasi kii tathaa melbern main 365 ran, edilade main 148 ran or melbern main pari or 200 ran se jeet darj karke ashes jiti thi
 Now England are again 2–0

 Australia won the second Test in Brisbane by seven wickets and in Adelaide by eight wickets
 australia melbern main keval teen ran se match haar gaya, lekin phir vah ashes 2-1 se apane naam karne main safal rahaa
 The interesting fact is that England had previously won the Ashes in 1981, while the following two series had been won by them
 usne 1980 se 1989 tak bich main keval ek baar 1982-83 main hi ashes ganvaayi thi
 William's younger brother Prince Harry was born on 15 September 1984, but the Ashes were not played that year
 england ne naatingham main khele gaye pehle match main australia ko 14 ran se haraaya
 He then registered a royal victory by 347 runs in the second Test match at Lord's
 australia kii lachar ballebaaji ko dekhte hue mana ja rahaa he ki england ashes apane paas banaae rakhane main safal rahegaa, lekin yadi kuch mithkon par gaur karen to uski raah aasaan nahin hogi

 ' saansad ne kaha- sanskrit se durust hota he nervas systamsarangi ne kaha- sanskrit se bane hai kai angreji shabdabhartiya janata party (bijepi) saansad ganesh singh ne guuruuvaar ko daawa kiya ki america ke ek shaikshanik santhaan ke shodh ke mutabik rojaanaa sanskrit bhashaa bolne se nervas system (tantrika tantra) ko tandoorusti milti he
 He said that it also keeps diabetes and cholesterol away
 sanskrit vishvavidhyalay ke bill par charchaa ke dauraan unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki america antariksh anusandhan sanghathannasake ek shodh ke mutabik agar computer programing sanskrit main kii jaati he to isamen koi gadabadi nahin rahegi
 BJP MP Ganesh Singh said that 97 percent of the world's languages, including some Islamic languages, are based on Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii buniyaad sanskrit rahi he
 During the discussion on this Sanskrit Bill, Union Minister Pratap Chandra Sarangi while speaking in Sanskrit language said that it is a very flexible language in which a single sentence can be spoken in many ways
 saarangi ne kaha, angreji ke kai shabdasanskritse nikle hai
 These include the words Brother (brother) and Kau (cow) from Sanskrit
 unhone kaha ki sanskrit jaisi pracheen bhashaaon ko badhaava dene se anya bhashaaon par koi asar nahin padegaa
 With this, the Lok Sabha on Thursday approved the Central Sanskrit University Bill 2019 granting the status of Central University to three honorary Sanskrit Universities in the country

 Before the arrival of Amit Shah on the 18th of August, there was a clear feeling of panic among the BJP leaders of Bhopal
 shivaraj singh sarkaar ke varisht mantriyon ne jahiraa taur par apane maatahaton ke saath ghanton baithken kin
 The issues of the priests were brightened and healed and corrected
 ek din kii deree se (ve dilli se apni udaan chook gaye the) shahar main aae bijepi adhyaksh ko bas kaam se matlab tha
 He even stopped long welcome speeches of some leaders
 shah kaa daura 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle chunavi ranneeti tay karne ke liye rajyon kii yatra kaa hissaa tha
 Maintaining its hold in states like Madhya Pradesh is very important for the saffron gameplan
 rajya main 2018 main vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai
 At various meetings during three days in Bhopal, the BJP chief had warned ministers and party officials not to divulge any details of the conversation to the press
 phir bhi sthaneey akhabaaron ne ultimatum jari karne or kharaab kaam karne vaale mantriyon ko chetavanee kii reportein chhaapin
 Later talking to the media, Shah dismissed these reports as speculation
 haalanki unhone 'khamosh rahane ke hukum' kii tasdik jarur kii or kaha ki yah 'anushaasan ke liye jaruri' tha
 Shah also dismissed rumors of a possible leadership change in the state
 unhone kaha ki chouhan agle saal chunaav main party kaa cheharaa honge
 Interestingly, he did not make such a promise regarding the continuance of state president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan
 mukhyamantri ke saath shah ke rishton ko khaskar vyapam ghotaale kii sharmindagi or kisaan andolan ke jor pakadaaey ke baad aksar 'utsaahhin' rishton ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 Despite this, he tied the bridge to praise Chauhan and patted him to bring Madhya Pradesh out of the status of BIMARU (backward) states
 unhone vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle madhya pradesh ke mantrimandal ke vistaar kii sambhaavna par bhi kuch kehane se manaa kar diya
 He said that it is a privilege of Chief Minister Chouhan to fill six vacant seats in the cabinet
 ye mahatvapurn isliye he kyonki mana ja rahaa tha ki rajyon kii baithkon ke madhyam se shah netritv ke kaabil chehre bhi talash rahe hai
 In meetings with local leaders, Shah insisted on winning all 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 bhaajapa pramukh kii takareeron main guna or chhindwara kii siton ko jeetna bhi shaamil tha, jo lambey arase se congress netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya or camel nath kaa garh rahi hai or 2014 kii narendra modi lahar main bhi inhen chhina nahin ja sakaa tha
 Akbaruddin Owaisi, brother of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi, has returned to India after a month of treatment
 gambhir beemaari se peedit akbaruddin shuukravaar subah landan se laute to samarthakon ne joardaar swaagat kiya

 After this Asaduddin Owaisi appealed to his supporters to pray for his brother Akbaruddin Owaisi

 He was then hospitalized

 AIMIM adhyaksh or hyderabad se saansad ovaisi ne shanivaar ko party kaaryakartaaon ko id milaap ke maukey par sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki ve akbaruddin kii sehat ke liye dua karen
 He said, "I congratulate you on Eid and pray that you pray for Asaduddin's health, he has gone for treatment
" mujhe pataa chalaa he ki unki sehat ek baar phir se kharaab ho gai he
 May Allah protect them and keep their health right, "tell that Akbaruddin is not out for treatment for the first time
 unke paariwarik sutron ne bataaya ki akbaruddin haj karne ke liye saudi arab gaye the, yahaan se ve landan gaye
 Akbaruddin Owaisi has intestinal problems

 Lucknow Metro has been inaugurated
 udghaatan par raajnneeti bhi ho chuki he
 The war of plundering credit has also taken place
 metro kharaab bhi ho chuki he
 Meanwhile, something happened that should not have happened
 lakhanu metro pariyojna ke safal hone kaa shrey jis vyakti ko sabase pehle janaa chahie vah hai desh ke 'metro main' or lakhanu metro ke chif adwiser i shridharan
 Under his leadership, the entire metro team worked and gave this beautiful gift to UP
 lekin, metro ke aitihaasik uddhatan main ain vakt shridharan peeche chhot gaye or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or grih mantri rajnath singh samet tamaam netaaon ne batan dabaakar metro kaa uddhatan kar diya
 (photo from social media) According to the people present on the occasion, this happened because the order of the chair of the stage was something like this
 or uddhatan kii hadabadi main unki ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya
 Whatever the reason, it is clear that if this mistake happened, then it has been in the race to take credit
 jis dimag ne nawabon ke shahar main metro pahunchaai, jisane lakhanu ko nai raftaar di vahi kuch kadamon se peeche rah gaya
 If you look closely, it is just a picture, but it says a lot
 kisi behatar kaam main, vikaas ke kaam main, raajnneeti kis kadar haaavee hoti he yah uski baangi bhar he
 On this occasion, the Lucknow metro rail service was launched on the first metro route from Transport Nagar to Charbagh by pressing the button

 com / njbafmt8oj — Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) September 3, 2017 isse pehle ke ghatnakram main pradhan nyaayadhish ne sarkaar ke saath supreme court or hoicourt main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ko lekar chal rahe vivaad ke bich colegium baithak bulaai thi
 Justice J
 chelmeshwar us baithak main shaamil nahin hue the
 Not only this, Justice Chelameswar also wrote a letter in this regard to Chief Justice TS Thakur
 tippaniyan According to sources, due to the stand of Justice Chelameswar, the other judges postponed the meeting as they believe that this undermines the prestige of the Supreme Court of India
 udhar, bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish ties thakur ne is mudde par kal apni sankshipt pratikriya dete hue kaha tha, "ham is mudde ko sulajhaa lenge
 " gauratlab he ki pichley saal oktober main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne centre sarkaar ke neshnal jeudicial appointment kamishan (engeesi) ko asanvaidhanik qaraar dete hue radd kar diya tha
 In a five-member bench, Justice Chelameswar had given a different verdict and questioned the collegium
 sansad main paarit kanoon kaa samarthan karte hue justise chelmeshwar ne jajon kii niyukti kii colegium pranali kii aalochana kii thi
 He said it had "no accountability"
 sutron ke mutabik, justise chelmeshwar ke rukh ke chalate anya jajon ne baithak ko taal diya kyonki unka maananaa he ki isse bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay kii pratishtha kaa avamulyan hota he
 On the other hand, Chief Justice of India TS Thakur, while giving his brief response on the issue yesterday, said, "we will resolve this issue
" " Significantly, in October last year, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court quashed the Central Government's National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC) as unconstitutional
 paanch sadasyeey bench main justise chelmeshwar ne sabase alag faisla sunaaya tha or colegium par sawaal uthaae the
 Supporting the law passed in Parliament, Justice Chelameswar criticized the collegium system of appointing judges
 unhone kaha tha ki isamen "koi javabdehi nahin he"

 i have been writing this column for 18 years and during this time i have often been advised by the people who are angry with me to get my mind checked
 lekin main jaraa bhi nahin diga, kam-se-kam abhi tak to nahin
 Now, when i am writing this column for the first time in a magazine, which i have recently taken up the task of editing, i am going to tamper with the central theme of this week's special report
 lekin soochna ke aadhiky ke is daur main jab har shaks har cheez aapse behatar jaanata he, us par apni nishchit raay bhi rakhata he, or swaghoshit ‘newnebrake’ main aapako chaunkaane kaa madda nahin rah gaya he to ek khaas rapat se aap yah to ummid kar hi sakate hai ki usamen aapako uksaane kaa madda ho
 So, this week's special report provokes me to ask some questions
 agar narendra modi apane naukarshahon ko aise adhikaron se navaj rahe hai, jo kareeb-kareeb apratyaashit he to ve unhen takat de rahe hai yaa kamjor kar rahe hai? ve babu raaj kaa aagaaj kar rahe hai yaa use khatm karne kii ore bad rahe hai? rajnatik karypalika kii takat or adhikaron ko simit kar rahe hai yaa use behaal kar rahe hai? ve ‘parampara’ todgaye ja rahe hai yaa ‘vyavastha’ banane kaa iraadaa rakhte hai yaa phir parampara kii taraf hi lautne kii raah bana rahe hai?agar main yah kahuun ki darasal narendra modi jo kadam uthaa rahe hai, vah pichley 10 saal ke babu raaj ke nirnaayak ant kii ore badha hua kadam he to is par aap kya kahenge?isse pehle ki aap mujhe chir-parichit salaah den yani kahen ki shekhar gupta ji, apane dimag kii jaanch karwaaie, jaraa in tathyon kii jaanch-padtaal kar lijie
 Although nobody does these days
 aap jaisaa sochate hai, uske vipareet, upie kaa ek dashak kaa shashan asal main bhartiya babushahi ke liye sabase suhana daur thiskaa yah arth katai nahin he ki babushahi sarvashaktimaan ho gai thi or mantrigan kamjor ho gaye the
 In a sense, both were weak during this period, their confidence decreased, their quality decreased and they came in miserable condition
 alabatta is dashak main naukarshahon kaa jivan behad aaramdaayak rahaa
 The working period also increased by at least five years
 bharat ke itihaas main isse pehle yah kabhi nahin hua ki kisi ek dashak main itane kam technocrat, visheshgy or baad mant pravesh paae afasar vagairah naukarshahi main aae
 Dr
 manmohan singh ko vitt sachiv or baad main bataur technocrat arabiai kaa governor niyukt kiya gaya
 His closest advisor and advocator of reforms Montek Singh Ahluwalia was later promoted to finance secretary
 yah baat ullekhneey he ki 2004 se 2014 ke bich aarthik afasarshahi main ek bhi gaiyr-iees adhikari is suhaani vyavastha main vyavdhaan, bauddhik vividhta yaa chunauti dene ke liye nahin laayaa gaya
 Dr
 manmohan singh ne apni satta ke aakhri varsh main hi kisi ‘bahari’ vyakti ko mahatvapurn aarthik pad ke liye chunaa
 Raghuram Rajan was made the Governor of RBI
 vah bhi tab, jab yah spasht ho gaya ki unase halke kad kaa koi shaks vaishvik chintaaon ko viraam nahin de paaegaa or desh kii teji se girti reating ko nahin sudhaar paaegaa
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee least of all industry
 ve
 Shahi was brought in as the Secretary of Power and his revolutionary thinking initiated extensive reforms in the field of electricity
 upie ke raaj main naukarshahi aisi kisi chunauti se mukhaatib nahin hui, balki is dauraan nae niamakon kii sthapana se naukarshahi kaa apratyaashit vistaar hua
 Some new regulators have multiple members
 isse hua yah ki koi nahin jaanata tha ki koun kise regulate kar rahaa he kyonki sari vyavastha uljhe taron main bandhi hui thi
 It seemed that the regulator needed only two qualifications - be a career bureaucrat and have retired from service
 modi ke daur main jis yuva, kaam ke prati jununee or tej-tarraar adhikariyon kii charchaaen suni jaaengi, vaise hi ek adhikari (chaliye hameshaa kii tarah naam na chhapane kii shart kaa laabh unhen de dete hai) ne haal main mujhase poochhaah aapane gaur kiya ki kis tarah sarkaar ne niamak kii niyukti kii nunatam aayu 60 varsh tay kar di he? apane kshetra ke 40 varshiya visheshgy aakhir niamak kyon nahin ho sakate?lekin main aakhir niamakon ko lekar itnaa gambhir kyon hum? vajah yah he ki yahi misaal yah bataane ke liye sabase sateek he ki pichley dashak main naukarshahi ko itnaa dulaar mila, jitna ab se pehle kabhi nahin mila tha
 Service expansion after 60 years and expansion of existing buildings in New Delhi
 dakshin dilli main kuch sabase puraane vyavsaayik ilaakon main baithne vaale adhikariyon ke liye varishthata hi ekmaatr yogyata rah gai thi
 It is as if there is a caretaker government in the country under the code of conduct of the Election Commission, in which merit is not given due consideration

 a new enclave has been built in Delhi, named Kriknyu Moti Bagh (I would like to name it New Kremlin in moments of impulse of honesty)
 yahaan 21veen sadi main lutiuns style ke lagbhag 100 bangale ‘cell’ financing ke aadhaar par banaae gaye
 This story will be discussed again sometime
 un bangalon main rahane waalon kii padtaal karen to adhiktar ritred adhikari hai, jo ab aaraamdeh padon par baithe hue hai
 Getting a thick salary and no obligation
 to rajyon ne bhi yahaan se prerana lee or apane yahaan bhi aisi hi aaraamgahon kaa nirmaan kar liya
 The officials were placed in the information commission, electricity rate regulator, tax tribunal, etc
 upie sarkaar ne kaaphi badi sankhya main netaaon kii bajaae purv naukarshahon ko rajyapal niyukt kiya
 He never sent any politician to the important embassy
 dow
 Singh empowered his most trusted bureaucrats so that they could advance their agenda rapidly
 udhaaharan ke liye rahul khullar (kabhi vitt mantralay main unke nijee sachiv rahe) ko commers sachiv banaaya gaya or baad main tri pramukh, shyaam saran or satinder lamba ko parmaanu qaraar karne or kashmir par sambhavit samjhaute ke liye bheja gaya
 Both made their ministers redundant
 jab upie ke ek dashak ke shasankaal main naukarshahi ko itnaa dulaar diya gaya to kya vah adhik taqatvar ban gai thi? yadi aap aisa sochate hai to mujhe sirf paanch naukarshahon ke naam gina dijie, jinhone apni chhap chodi
 i get stuck on three names - Shyam Saran and Shivshankar Menon from Foreign Service and m from IPS
 ke
 Narayanan
 ab main vyaktigat rup main inke bare main bataaungaa
 One of our fastest-growing foreign secretaries, Saran also saw the time in the short period of 2007-08, when Dr
 singh ne nai videsh niti kaa aadhaar rakhaa
 especially as
 natwar singh ke jane ke baad
 He later withdrew from his role as climate change treaty negotiator as Manmohan Singh lost political importance

 Narayanan got strength from his past
 jahaan tak hamen yaad padataa he, tii

 Nair and Pulak Chatterjee have been the weakest chief secretaries in the PMO
 asal main upie kaa kaarykaal isiilie yaad kiya jayega ki naukarshah khud ko kitna kamjor mahasoos karte the, kitne varisht adhikari jail gaye yaa sibiai dwaara pareshaan kiye gaye or kitne uske khilaaf ho gaye

 This is sufficient to confirm that the Takwatar leaders strengthen the bureaucracy and use them as their weapons of power
 modi yahi karne ja rahe hai
 Modi is going to strengthen both the political class and its loyal bureaucrats or, using a word of Urdu, they are going to raise their Iqbal

 narayanan ne pashchim bengal ke rajyapal pad se istipha de diya
 Normally i would not mention it, but Sanjay Baru, an eyewitness of the incident, has mentioned it in his book The Accidental Prime Minister
 nai dilli ke hyderabad house main ek party main narayanan mere paas aae or meri ankhon ke saamne apni ungliyaan laakar bole ki meraa akhbaar (tab indian express) raashtrapati pad ke liye upie ummidavaar pratibha patil ke peeche kyon padaa he
 Our articles are correct, even then what is necessary to be printed
 ham kaise faisla karte hai ki kya chhaapen? meraa jawaab tha, jo chhapane laayak hota he, chhapate hai
 He said, maybe you think that your newspaper is the New York Times and this is America
 ab yadi main kisi mahatvapurn shakhsiyat ke daagdar pahalu ko chhapana chahta hum to ve mujhe kisi bhi mahatvapurn vyakti ke daagdar pahalu bataa sakate hai
 My answer was, if it is in public interest then i will definitely print it
 ham main se ek bhi haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 But over time we got compromised and i began to understand, like them - their talent, energy, patriotism and even their sense of humor
 2008 main kashmir ghati main phir ubaal aayaa
 Leaders and officials were losing their patience
 lekin narayanan majbootee se vahaan khadey rahe
 i would even say that he saved Kashmir for India
 haal main gata ek mazaakia vakya bhi yaad aa rahaa he
 He recently met her at a wedding in Hyderabad
 jab ham log dinar ke liye jane lage to hamase peeche ke raste se vanquet haul main pravesh karne ke liye kaha gaya, jahaan ek kone main viypi ke liye arakshit jagah thi
 The emperor of the detectives smiled and said, "I have forgotten when i entered through the front door last time

 But as far as i know them, they will not do it

 Contrary to what you think, the 10 years of the UPA was actually the happiest period for Indian babushahi
 iskaa yah arth nahin he ki babushahi sarvashaktimaan ho gai thi or mantrigan kamjor
 In a sense, both became weak, helpless and pathetic during that period

 Lalu Yadav has been angry with Nitish Kumar for breaking the grand alliance in Bihar
 lalu ne nitish kai gambhir aarope bhi lagaae
 Lalu attacked Nitish saying that the resignation was completely set
 nitish par bhi 302 kaa mukadmaa darj he or unke khilaaf sangyaan liya ja chukaa he
 There is no Chief Minister of the country who has a murder case registered
 un par jo mukadmaa darj he usamen faansee kii sajaa he
 This statement is not mine but his affidavit mentions the matter, so how did he sit on the post of CM
 eemaandaaree or bhrashtachar se bada he atyaachaar or nitish kumaar usee hatya ke aaropee hai
 This is the zero tolerance policy of my younger brother Nitish Kumar
 unako yah maaloom tha ki ab is maamle main ham bachane vaale nahin he isliye unhone tejasvi se istipha na mangakar khud istipha de diya
 Apart from this, Lalu also targeted Nitish by tweeting one after the other
 lalu ne nitishako chunaav main aane kii bhi chunauti di he
 Lalu said in a tweet that Nitish, who calls for morality and corruption, should come to the polls
 pataa lag jayega janata bhrashtachar / naitikta kii ladaai main kitna unke saath he?naitikta or bhrashtachar kii duhai dene vaale nitish ko chunaav main aana chahie
 Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) July 26, 2017 Lalu said that the poor, deprived and reservation-backed sections of Bihar had given the Grand Alliance a historic majority against the BJP
 mahagathbandhan kii bhrunahatya kii ja rahi he
 The charge is on both Nitish and Tejashwi
 mahagathbandhan dalon ke vidhayako ko baithkar nayaa netaa chunanaa chahie
 This is the expectation of the socially just people of Bihar
 bihar main record tod bahumataibhjhf ke viruddh mila tha
 Now with the support of the same BJP, Nitish will set a moral record by running the government
 bihar main record tod bahumat BJP ke viruddh mila tha
 Now with the support of the same BJP, Nitish will set a moral record by running the government
 — Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd)july 26, 2017argedy pramukh ne twit kar kaha ki hamaare upar bhrashtachar ke tathakthith aarope pehle se hi the
 Didn't Nitish Kumar know when forming alliances and forming a government? We were already having allegations of corruption
 kya gathbandhan karte or sarkaar banaate vaqt nitish kumaar nahin jaanate the?— Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd)july 26, 2017when Nitish Kumar broke alliance with BJP in 2013 he choreographed & followed the same script to secure himself
 He surrenders as per needs— Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) July 26, 2017 Lalu's charges against Nitish; RJD supremo Lalu Yadav also came to the media after Nitish's move and made many serious allegations against Nitish Kumar
 lalu yadav ne nitish kumaar par vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat lage aaropon kii fehrist bataai
 RJD supremo said, a murder case is registered against Nitish Kumar, in which he can also be sentenced to life imprisonment
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ne khud chunavi halafname main 302 or 307 kii dhara ke tahat cese kii baat sweekaari thi
 Nitish knew that he would not survive, he was afraid of life imprisonment and death sentence, so he resigned
 pakistani sena ne elosi par sijafire kaa ulanghan kiyabharatiya sena se pakistan ne kii thi sanyam baratane kii apilpakistani sena ne mangalvaar ko sizafire kaa ulanghan kiya
 Children were trapped in schools due to the shelling of Pakistani army
 hairaani kii baat he ki pakistan ne is harakat se pehle khud hi bhartiya sena se sanyam baratane kii apil kii thi
 Pakistan had appealed that it plans to take diplomats and journalists to areas near the Line of Control in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok)
 rajanyikon or patrakaron ke ek group ne agrim ilaakon kaa daura kiya, vahiin pakistani sena ne mangalvaar ko elosi par sijafire kaa ulanghan kiya
 Firing and mortar shells were fired from across the Mendhar sector of Poonch
 bhartiya sena ke sutron ne bataaya, ‘samvaad ke sthapit channel ke jariye unhone hamen sijafire kaa ulanghan naa kiye jane kii zarurat bataai kyonki rajanyik samudaay or patrakaron ko elosi ke paas daura karnaa tha
 The Indian Army honored this request but the Pakistani Army itself violated the ceasefire
 bataa den ki pakistan ne shanivaar ko tangadhaar sector main nagarikon ko nishaanaa banaate hue baari golabari kii thi
 The Indian Army also gave a fitting reply
 donon taraf se golabari 10 ghante tak jari rahi
 The Indian Army destroyed four terrorist targets
 is karrwai main pakistani sena kii kuch chaukiyon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa
 Pakistan was embarrassed when people demonstrated for independence against the Government of Pakistan in Muzaffarabad of pok
 unka paak surakshakarmiyon se takaraav bhi hua
 This happened on the day the Pakistani Army moved diplomats and journalists to areas near the loc
 appal yphone-6 launch hone ke saath hi surkhiyon main he
 4 million phones have been ordered within 24 hours of the launch of the iphone-6 and iphone-6 Plus
 company ne bataaya ki yphone-6 or yphone-6 plus kii delivery 19 sitambar se shuru ho jaaegi lekin kuch jagahon par phone kii delivery oktober tak nahin hogi
 Last Friday, Apple's website came to a standstill due to more online orders
 appal ke phone kii deewangi pehle bhi logon main bahut rahi he
 Last year, Apple sold 9 million phones within 3 days of the sale of the phone
 appal yphone-6 ko pichley hafte hi launch kiya gaya tha
 In India, its price will be more than 50 thousand rupees
 haalanki company ne is bare main koi aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 Preparations have started once again to produce identity card
 bhartiya nagarikon kii pahchaan kaa kaam ab phir se shuru hoga
 Government servants will go door-to-door to identify Indian citizens
 kendra sarkaar ne nirdesh diya he ki teen varshon main desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke naam neshnal population register main darj kar die jaaen
 The aim of the government is that all the citizens get verified in three years and only Indian citizens get this card
 yah card unke pahchaan kaa sabase bada saboot hoga or yahaan tak ki vot daalate vakt bhi ise paas rakhana hoga
 The government wants to get these made and ensure that only Indian citizens are registered in it
 logon ko apni pahchaan sabit karne ke liye pehle se nirdhaarit chah tarah ke dastavej main se koi ek pesh karnaa hoga
 Obviously, the government will exert a lot of power on this campaign and will spend a lot of money
 lekin sawaal he ki us aadhaar card kaa kya hoga jis banane ke liye sarkaar ne arabon rupee kharch kiye ? aadhaar card banane ke liye sarkaar ne ek puraa vibhaag banaaya, nandan neelekani ko cabinet mantri kaa darja diya or arabon rupee kharch kiye
 Thousands of employees participated in this campaign and information was gathered from door to door
 lekin baad main upie sarkaar main hi uski pramanikta par sawaal khadey ho gaye or enpiaar project par kaam karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 Now the NDA government has decided to put full emphasis in it
 lekin sawaal phir uthta he ki is desh main itani baar card banaakar bhi ham avaidh rup se rahane vaale videshi nagarikon kii pahchaan nahin kar paae
 The BJP itself claims that more than one crore Bangladeshis live illegally in Bharatha
 hairaani kii baat he ki unke paas passport sahit sabhi tarah ke card hai
 Ration card etc
 is very simple
 ab sarkaar chaahati he ki asli bhartiya nagarikon kaa hi nae card ke liye registration ho
 But how will it be done? When sensitive and important documents like passports are made illegal citizens, any card can be made
 uske liye bhi pulicekarmi jaanch karne ghar par hi jate hai
 Despite this, there are reports that many people have multiple passports
 agar aisi sthiti he to phir is nae card ke bare main kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki yah bilkul surakshit dhang se ban sakegaa
 In the country whose DNA itself has entered corruption, such cards will be made with complete honesty, what is the guarantee? If thousands of people still enter the border of Bangladesh with India by paying money, how will their cards be prevented? Even more important is how it will be ensured that the cards of millions of Bangladeshi who have entered India, then Not made of? Then how will the cards of those who are very poor and homeless be made because they do not even have any documents
 mahanagaron main sudur gaanvon se aakar kaam karne vaale shramikon, gharon main jhaadu-pochha karne vaale lakhon karmiyon ke paas to koi bhi dastavej nahin hota he
 How will their cards be made? All these questions are complex and relevant
 sarkaar inke samaadhaan ke liye kya karegi? kya uske paas koi yojana he? sirf yah ghoshnaa kar dene maatr se ki sarkari karmchaaree ghar-ghar jaaenge or pataa lagaayenge, vaid or avaidh kaa fark nahin mit jayega
 Local leaders also do not want anything like this to happen due to vote bank politics
 yah sabhi jaanate hai ki bihar, bengal, assam or yahaan tak ki dilli main bhi bangladeshiyon ko sthaneey netaaon ne sharan di or unhen vot bank main tabdeel kiya
 Now it remains to be seen how the government implements it and how it results
 tab tak ham intjaar hi kar sakate hai

 He said, 'we had scored almost 90 runs in the first ten overs
 yah shandaar shuruyaat thi or hamen ise barkaraar rakhana tha
 Sachin, Sehwag gave us a good start and then Gambhir contributed fruitfully
 ’bhartiya captain ne kaha ki ab trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke final main pahunchane kii unki ummid austrailia or srilanka ke bich shuukravaar ko hone vaale match par tiki rahengi or isliye unke khilaadi do din kharidari main bithaayenge
 He said, 'we will go shopping for the next two days and will spend some time in practice as well
 ab hamaare haath main kuch bhi nahin he
 'man of the match Kohli said that the goal of 321 runs could be achieved in 40 overs only with the efforts of the entire team

 Sources said that the Pakistani media reported that it was "factually incorrect and misleading" that the two leaders sat next to each other in the SCO meeting
 unhone kaha, ‘essio main baithne kii vyavastha roosi varnmaala ke anusaar hota he jiske tahat bharat or pakistan ek saath nahin aa sakate
 This is the ideal tradition of SCO meetings
 ’essio ke videsh mantriyon kii baithak main hissaa lene ke liye sushamaa mangalvaar ko kirgiz ganraajya kii rajdhani pahunchin
 India was granted SCO membership along with Pakistan in 2017

 His complaint was that we sometimes talk bitterly
 vah aaj mithai lekar ain taaki ham meetha bol saken

 Is everything going well between BJP and Nitish Kumar? When Nitish Kumar was asked about this, he said that you are a journalist, you are free to interpret anything, there is no restriction on you
 nitish ne kaha ki ham pehle hi kah chuke hai ki jab bhi kuch hoga to chalegaa hi naa kuch naa kuch
 We have no objection in this nor do we have any objection but we have put our point in front of you and have also said publicly that now you can get the chance of whatever you want, you are free to do so
