 The Bihar Assembly has 243 seats
 jedy (you) ke paas 118 vidhayak hai or uske paas rajyasabha main 3 pratyaashiyon ko bhejne ke baad 13 atirikt vot bache hai

 Is it necessary that after being successful in Mumbai or Kolkata or America, Marwari Businessman or NRI will also invest in Rajasthan
 kya koi gujarati vyapaaree ko yaad dilaayaa jaae ki aap gujarat se hai or ek factory vahaan bhi daal sakate hai yaa phir koi bijness samudaay ko telugana banaam andhra main baantkar unhen nyotaa dene lage to isse desh ke bheetar bijnesaman kii kya chhavi hogi yaa is kaaran rajyon ke bich jo pratiyogita hogi, kya isse do rajyon ke bich tanaav paidaa ho saktaa he

 Of course, we should speak, but if the purpose of speaking is that she wants to promote the neighborhood identity in a professional community, then there can be a problem

 Last year, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel also visited Mumbai
 bijness jagat ko angreji main sambodhit karte-karte achaanak gujarati bolne lageen
 According to the report of Indian Express, Anandiben Patel said that when Narendra Bhai can speak Hindi in America, i can speak Gujarati in Mumbai
 beshak bolnaa chahie, lekin bolne kaa agar yah makasad ho ki vah ek peshewar community main ilaakai pahchaan ko ubhaarna chaahati hai to samasya ho sakati he
 In the same sequence, today's Indian Express has reported that N
 Lokesh Naidu, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and KT Rama Rao, son of Telangana Chief Minister K
 Chandrasekhar Rao, are in America these days
 rajya banta to america main rahane vaale enarai kaa bhi bantwaaraa ho gaya he or isi aadhaar par inhen lubhaane ke kram main donon ke bich pratiyogita chhidi hui he
 Lokesh Naidu is in California and Rama Rao in New York
 chandrababu naidu ke bete sarkaar ke pratinidhi to nahin he, phir bhi mukhyamantri kii taraf se america main andhra community ke saath rishte sudhaarney gaye hai
 The us-based Andhra Pradesh will attend a meeting of NRE and also appeal for investment
 las angelis main lokesh ne smart village - smart ward ke naam par 100 limosin kaaron ke saath ek pradarshnee bhi nikaali or sthaneey samudaay se apil kii ki ve ek-ek gaanv ko god len
 It is written in the report of Indian Express
 ramarao bhi telugana ke enarai se mulaakaat karenge
 In one way, nobody should see evil in it, but when it starts appearing at the extreme level, then there will be problem
 baahar ke desh yaa rajya main paisa aa jane yaa kaamyaab ho jane se hi us rajya ke liye aapaki upyogita bad jaati he, yah ek kism kaa licenseraj or saanskrithik avasarwaad he
 The ability to invest in someone is being evaluated based on language and culture
 nishchit rup se in tathakthith kaamyaab enarai ne america main kamyaabi vahaan ke khule maahaul ke kaaran hi banaai, varna unhen andhra pradesh chhodane kii zarurat hi nahin hoti
 These NRI businessmen have become important for every political party these days
 inaki vajah se rajya kii arthvyavastha main kya badlaav aayaa, yah kisi ko nahin maaloom, lekin inhen lubhaane ke naam par rajya kaaphi paisa kharch kar rahaa he, taaki apane-apane kshetron main voter ko prabhavit kiya ja sake
 Investment opportunity is for everyone, then it should be done in a neutral way
 varna desh main ek mukhyamantri kii vaahvahee to ho jaaegi, magar anya rajyon main vikaas kaa asantulan jari hi rahegaa
 In this context, no one will come to invest in Bihar or UP
 vaise iskaa raajnneetik matlab yah bhi he ki in samudaayon kii kamyaabi ateet se lekar aaj tak aise hi network ke aadhaar par khadi hui he

 ek lihaaz se isamen kisi ko buraai na dikhe, lekin jab yah ati ke str par dikhne lagegaa to samasya hogi
 It is a kind of licentiousness and cultural opportunism that increases your usefulness for that state only when money comes or becomes successful in an outside country or state

 Otherwise a Chief Minister will be praised in the country, but the imbalance of development in other states will continue

 sabaki daavedaari yahi he ki hamane ye niyam bana die hai, hamaare yahaan ye he or wo he
 Business is not spread by calling someone from somewhere
 bijness failata he samay or bazaar kii zarurat ke aadhaar par

 After the insistence and insistence of the state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, now the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital will be upgraded to AIIMS
 shanivaar ko patna main swasthya mantralay ke ek kaarykram main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke is aagrah parkendriya swasthya mantri jepi nadda ne sahmati jataa di
 Let me tell you that for the last several months, there was a lot of controversy about the location of other AIIMS in Bihar
 mana ja rahaa tha ki kendriya swasthya rajya mantri ashvini choube bhagalpur main duusare ames kii sthapana karnaa chaahate the
 For this reason, this matter was hanging
 shanivaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki 2015 ke kendriya bajet main vittamantri arun jetali ne bihar main doosraa ames kholane kighoshnaa kii thi, lekin abhi tak iskejagah kaa chayan nahin ho paaya
 He said that just as Patna's Bihar College of Engineering was upgraded to NIT, Darbhanga Medical College Hospital should be upgraded to AIIMS
 nitish kumaar ne saafakia ki vartmaan main DMCH main jo bhi doctor ames ke laayak hai unhen hi rakhaa jaae or baaki doctoron ko rajya sarkaar apnekisi anya medical college yaa swasthya vibhaag main samyojit kar legi
 However, this requires a change in the current policy
 is kaarykram main kendriya swasthya rajya mantri ashvini choube bhi maujuud the or unhone bhi is prastaav par sahmati jataai
 Actually, Nitish Kumar is adamant on upgrading Darbhanga Medical College Hospital to AIIMS because it has enough 200 acres of land

 israel kaa kahana he ki ye rocket rihaayshi ilaakon se daage gaye or isi vajah se javaabi karrwai main aam naagarik hataahat ho sakate hai

 There was a loud explosion and then a smoldering smoke was seen

 Before we left Gaza, this news was shown on NDTV and also posted on our website
 hamaas uski ore se rocket daage jane kii khabar ko kabhi sweekaar nahin karata, lekin jis tarah se israel dwaara hamalon se hataahat gaja ke logon ko dikhaanaa jaruri tha, utana hi jaruri yah dikhaanaa bhi tha ki kis tarah hamaas khud shahar kii ghani aabaadi ke bich se rocket daag rahaa he

 Justice Chaudhary dismissed the plea against Musharraf for a sedition case
 sainya shashan ke dauraan 60 se adhik jajon ko barkhaast kar diya gaya tha, jisamen justise choudhary bhi shaamil the

 supreme court ne pakistan ke purv raashtrapati ko saman jari kar kaaran bataane ko kaha tha ki unhone 2007 main desh main apatkaal kyon lagaaya or 60 se adhik jaj ko bakhrast kyon kiya

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, the googly of Samajwadi Party mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav has stirred political circles
 mulaayam singh yadav ke bayaan par lagaataar aa rahi tippaniyon ke bich unke hi purv saathi rahe amar singh ne bada bayaan diya he
 Amar Singh says that Mulayam is making such a statement so that he can get benefit in the case of Chandrakala and Rama Raman and cannot take big action to Narendra Modi
 rajyasabha saansad amar singh ne news agency ANI se baat karte hue kaha, ‘’ye bayaan sirf kanfusion failaane ke liye diya ja rahaa he, taaki chandrakala or rama raman ke jo maamle chal rahe hai jinhone mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati ke raaj main bhrashtachar kiya tha vah maamla dab sake
 And Prime Minister should not take big action for Modi
 ’’aapako bataa den ki buudhvaar ko aae mulaayam singh yadav ke bayaan ke baad se iske kai myne nikaale ja rahe the
 In such a situation, now Amar Singh's statement can make the matter even more tense

 In the match between India and Bangladesh in March 2007, the visiting team declared the innings by scoring 387 runs for eight wickets in the first innings, in the midst of rain, in response to which the hosts were reduced to 268 runs

 While some aspects of the terrorist attack have been touched upon in the film, the terrorist incident in Mumbai's Trident has also been ignored
 
 
 lekin haa, ek-do jagahon par film aapako bhavuk kar detii he
 
 
 i would just like to mention here that 26 / 11 is a sad incident in our country, which cannot be put in the field of entertainment, and i think it would be wrong to weigh the film made on this attack in the rating scales, so i can No one wants to give a rating

 Shah said that the Congress' tweet reflects negativity

 pradhanmantrinarendra modiki mahatvakankshi yojanaon main se ek kaushal vikaas ke saath khilwaad ke kai maamle saamne aae hai
 False certificates and names of subsidized money are reaching brokers
 kaushal vikaske jariye pradhanmantri modi kaa sapana he ki desh kaa noujvaan vyavsaayik vishyon main prashikshit hokar rojgaar paidaa karen
 For this, the government has also kept a huge budget, but till today the team started investigating at the ground level, it was found that the subsidy money is being consumed by the brokers with false certificates and names
 40 karod logon ko rojgaar kaa lakshyapradhanmantri modi kii mahatvakankshikaushal vikaas yojanaki shuruyaat july 2015 main kii gai thi
 Through this, a target has been set to provide about 40 crore people in the country by 2022
 chaahe mantralay hon yaa tamaam enjio yaa phir privet companiyaan, inkaa makasad he ki 2022 tak kaushal vikaas kaa yah lakshya hasil kar liya jaae
 The objective of the skill development scheme is to provide high-speed vocational training to the people at a rapid pace so that the country can become the world's largest employable country for the next decade, but until today it has joined the Skill India Mission When i started investigating the Integrated Skill Development Scheme of the Ministry of Textiles, it was found that many questions are standing in the way of this program
 yahaan yah bhi dhyaan dene kii jarurat he ki kapadaa mantralay kaa integrated skill dawalpment skim (aisads) project public prite partnership yani pipipi model par chalata he
 The agencies working in this get 75 percent government subsidy of the fixed amount of ten thousand rupees per candidate, but when we started the investigation, it was found that some of those who were to be benefited, some of them fell victim to the deception of corrupt middlemen
 yojana main gadabadjhaalaa kaa puraa maamla saamne aane ke baad kaushal vikaas mantri dharmendra pradhan kaa kahana he ki puure maamle kii jaanch kii jaaegi
 Strict action will be taken against the culprits
 bina prashikshan mila certificatuttar pradesh ke bundelkhand ilaake ke doordaraj vaale gaanv chaukin purava main hamane aiesadi yojana main phayda paane waalon kii list nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Among the government schemes, we have identified three people
 aisads ke record main tara chandra ek prashikshit darji hai jinhone modern ajukeshan sosayadi main silaai kaa prashikshan liya he
 For this, he was also given a certificate (number 17210867803) by the Ministry of Textiles on 23 September 2017, while Tara Chandra himself says that he never visited that center
 tara chandra ke alaava rakesh ko bhi silaai main prashikshan ke liye isi sosayadi se kapadaa mantralay kii ore se jari certificate (condidet number 1507398) hasil hua he
 On February 5, 2018, Rakesh has been shown on the website of ISDS on employment and that too on earning Rs 6500 a month, but Rakesh himself says that he never went for any training
 anita devi kaa bhi yahi haal he jinhen 23 sitambar 2017 ko jari certificate (number 17210867810) diya gaya
 His name is also included in the list of beneficial people of ISDS
 duusare gaanv kaa bhi yahi halchaukin purava hi paas ke ek anya atarra gaanv main bhi yahi gadabadjhaalaa dikhaa
 Ramanuja of this village has also got a certificate of being a tailor under ISDS
 inhen MAEER, maharashtra kii ore se certificate (number 17130665810) diya gaya he
 But Ramanuj does not know that he has been trained in Maharashtra Academy of Engineering and Educational Research i
e
 MAEER in 2016 because he never went there
 jab unase kaarykram ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone bataaya ki chhedilal naam ke ek bichauliye ne unako thag liya
 Ramanuja alleges that Usadlal had taken his Aadhar card by making false promises of government training
 maharashtra academy of ejineering and ajukational research ke pune sthit daftar main ramanuj ke aaropon kii sachai kii jaanch kii gai to iske cordinating officer mahesh deshpandey ne daawa kiya ki sarkari niyamon ke mutabik hi kaarykram karaayaa gaya tha
 Deshpande, who is in need of a government inquiry, categorically denied the scam, but the documents and the statements of the people that Aaj Tak has, show that there have been malfunctions and it needs government investigation
 jin naujavaanon ko hunarmand banane ke liye training or certificate diya gaya, unako uske bare main pataa hi nahin
 All this happened on paper and middlemen blew away government subsidies
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki sarkaar kii yojanaon ko amal main laane vaali nijee companiyaan or santhaan bhi to isamen mili hue nahin hai
 Social activist Ruby Zainab, who runs an NGO named Al Fiza in Aliganj in up's Banda district
 unka enjio al phija upekshit-vanchit samudaay ke logon ko vyavsaayik prashikshan detaa he
 Modern Education Society, a Sonepat organization affiliated to the Ministry of Textiles, selected Ruby Zainab's NGO to train 150 women in sewing under the ISDS program last year
 artiai se hua khulaasiske baad jainab ne training class shuru kii
 He felt that this was a reliable scheme sponsored by the government
 shuruaati daur main sab kuch acha chalata rahaa, lekin unke pareshaan hone kii ghadi tab ai jab modern ajukeshan sosayadi ke inspectoron ne achaanak unke enjio main aana band kar diya
 Zainab then filed an RTI for information about the program, in which the reply shook him
 23 agast, 2018 ko artiai kii ore se bheje gaye jawaab se khulaasa hua ki unke enjio se 146 mahilaon ko pehle hi training mil chuki he
 Not only this, 95 women got work even among them
 jainab ke mutabik unke yahaan training lene waalon ko na to koi course certificate mila, naa hi us program ko karaane ke liye unako koi bhugtan hua
 But the RTI revealed that the Ministry has also paid to the Modern Education Society of Sonepat for running ISDS course at different places and that too a huge amount of Rs 1 crore 12 lakh
 20 saal kii shabnam kaa naam bhi jainab ke centre par silaai course main darj he, lekin naa to usko diploma certificate mila, naa koi kaam, jabaki artiai ke jawaab se pataa chalaa ki ummidavaaron kii ek lambii chaudee list to badi companiyon main naukari bhi paa chuki he
 The refusal of the disturbance When the team of the senior reached Mohinder Gaur, the then President of the Modern Education Society, for his clarification, he dismissed the charge of any kind of error
 mohinder gaur ne kisi tarah kii gadabadi se inkaar kar diya
 In his defense, he showed the same figures of the Ministry on which Zainab was disputed
 upi ke atarra gaanv main sthaneey saamaajik kaaryakarta raja bhaiya kaa aarope he ki vyavsaayik prashikshan kaa jhootha bharosa dekar bichauliye gaanv waalon ke aadhaar card ikattha kar rahe hai
 Raja Bhaiya started his center to run the state government program linked to the Skill India Mission, but he says he stopped it due to corruption

 bhrashtachar par ankush lagane vaale 6 vidheyakon ko sansad se paarit karaane main vipaksh dwaara sahyog nahin kiye jane ke rahul gandhi ke aarope ko khaarij karte hue bhaajapa ne shanivaar ko kaha ki is duraachaar ke khilaaf congress adhyaksh pichley 10 saal main ek shabd nahin bole or bhrashtachar virdohi muhim main shaamil hone kii unki daavedaari eemaandaar nahin he
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that Rahul has been the late leader in the anti-corruption campaign
 pichley das saal se samprag shashan bhrashtachar kaa shikaar rahaa he or itane varshon main vah is sambandh main ek shabd nahin bole
 But now he is claiming that the fight against corruption is his issue
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne isamen jodate hue kaha ki rahul na sirf bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main der se shaamil hue hai balki apane prayaason main vah eemaandaar bhi nahin hai
 Jaitley and Swaraj blamed the Congress and the UPA government for not being able to pass other anti-corruption bills in Parliament in response to questions at a joint press conference here today after the winter session of Parliament concluded on Friday
 sushamaa ne kaha ki sansad main hangaamaa sattarudh dal ke sadasyon ne kiya
 It is the Congress and its leadership that has lost control over its mps
 vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha ki samprag sarkaar kaa shashan bhrashtachar se bharaa rahaa lekin rahul kabhi bhi uske khilaaf nahin bole
 He said that Rahul's involvement in this fight cannot be called an honest attempt if there is an anti-corruption environment in the country, and it is as if a cat is eating Haj after eating a hundred rats
 jetali ne sawaal kiya ki congress upaadhyaksh us samay kyon khamosh baithe rahe, jab ek ke baad ek 2ji spectrum, koyala block aavanton, rashtramandal khel, adarsh houseing sosayadi or viviipi helicopter jaise ghotaale saamne aa rahe the

 The company may give its employees anything in the name of bonus, but they have to show off
 aapako bonus bolaa kitna bhi jaae lekin asal main kisko kitna mila, ye baat har kisi ke dimag main rahati hi he

 ji haa, ek company ne kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon ko kitna rupaya bonus ke naam par diya, is baat kaa saboot pahaad banaakar dikhaa diya
 According to Shanghai, a 'cash Mountain' was built in a steel plant company in China

 media ke alag−alag madhyamon main chunaav chaane laga he
 The wall of TV and Twitter is broken
 donon ek duusare ko dekhakar rang badalane lage hai
 According to the parties on social media, camps have been formed and truthful arguments are being made on every incident
 isi ke saath tamaam raajnneetik dal tamaam kamiyon ke baavjood kai acchhee baaten bhi kah rahe hai
 They are claiming to present a new perspective, but our question is something else
 ek adarsh chunaav kii sthiti kya honi chahie ki sirf matdaan kaa pratishat hi bade usee kaa gauravgaan ho yaa matdaan pratishat kii chintaa chhod muddon ko samajhane main bhagidaari kare
 What are the means for this, speech advertising, manifesto or media
 kya paryaapt jaankaree na hone kii sthiti main vot dene se nahin bachanaa chahie
 It is not right that our voter does not vote wisely
 agar iske ulat kuch kahenge to aapako itani daant padegi ki aap khandan kar phir yahi kahenge ki voter se samajhadaar koi nahin hota
 But, we are raising this question because rallies have been going on since year, hundreds of crores of rupees have been blown on the advertisement, but no one has released the manifesto yet
 reliyon main netaa alag−alag mudde uthaate hai, magar is tarah se kisi ek mudde ke prati vyapak samaj nahin ban paati

 Over gestures and emotionality in gestures
 netaaon ke alaava media kaa ek bada hissaa bhi yahi karata he
 Every party has its claims
 un daavon kaa koi pareekshan nahin he
 There are 100 million new voters in the 2014 election
 do karod tees lakh matadaata aise hai jo 18 se 19 saal ke hai
 All the parties are watching them
 vaise baaki sattar karod bhi kam mahatvapurn nahin he
 The desire for change is not less than the youth
 aaj ham is nae matadaata ke chote se hisse ke saath baat karenge
 Our sample is also diverse according to the socio-economic diversity of India, i cannot claim it completely, but talking to these 18 to 24 year old voters, one can get a rough idea of what the old and new parties are thinking about
 Huh
 aaj indian express main rahul verma or pradeep chhibbar kaa ek lekh padhaa
 Both of them are associated with the Department of Political Science of the University of California Berkeley, USA
 inhone 1996 se 2009 ke chunavi aankadon kaa vishleshan kar bataaya he ki ek matadaata alag-alag raajnneetik dalon main is aadhaar par fark karata he ki vanchit saamaajik samoohon ke liye uske paas kya yojanaayen hai
 What will be the policies of a party's government in these matters of the state
 rahul or pradeep is dharna ko tod rahe hai ki bharat kaa chunaav vichaaron nitiyon or vijan ke aadhaar par nahin hota
 This article states that most people who oppose the rules of social security are in the upper caste
 dalit or muslim aisi sarkari yojanaon ko kaafii mahatv dete hai
 In a way, the citizen according to his religion or caste makes his view whether the scheme of social security goes on or not
 kai log saamaajik suraksha yojanaon ko sabsidi, tushtikaran or karadaataaon ke paise ke durupyog kii nazar se dekhte hai hamaara sawaal he ki kya is baar kaa matadaata or das karod nae matadaata bilkul nae nazar se chunaav main bhagidaari karenge
 Apart from these questions for him, what will be the questions that will make his decision go here and there
 rahul verma or pradeep chhibbar ne dow ambedkar kaa ek uddhran diya he
 It is not enough just to be a voter
 kanoon nirmaataa hona bhi zaruri he
 Otherwise the lawmakers who will be their masters will be mere voters
 pichley do saal main 22 rajyon main chunaav hue hai jahaan mat pratishat main kaaphi vruddhi hui he
 This is no small achievement
 purv mukhya chunaav ayukta esavai kuraishi ne indian express main hi likhaa he ki chaar saal pehle 18−19 saal ke yuva matadaataaon main se das−baarah pratishat hi registerd hote the
 Now this percentage has increased significantly
 matdaan karne waalon main mahilaon kaa pratishat kaaphi badha he
 For this, the Election Commission has run continuous programs of voter awareness
 yahaan tak ki chunaav ayog ab swayan matadaata ke ghar matdaan kii parchi bhijwane laga he
 Whenever you feel that nothing has happened in India, at least you can be proud of the Election Commission for these two months
 thik thaak feel karenge
 So today we will gossip on how the new voter is going to make his decision
 haar jeet kii baat nahin karenge magar samajhenge is jaandaar matadaata ke faisle kii prakriya google se guzarati he yaa tivi se yaa suni sunai baton se yaa koun jitegaa tip ke survey se

 Before changing bio on Twitter, he said that before this Jyotiraditya was in discussion about changing his bio on Scindia

 " dilli ke mahrauli ilaake main ek pita ne ruh kampa dene vaala jurm kiya he
 The executioner sanded the neck of his wife, two flower daughters and innocent son with a knife
 isse us shaks kii maansik haalat kaa andaja laga sakate hai
 Neighbors are saying that the man's mental condition was not right
 bigadi maansik sthiti main hi usne apane hi parivaar ke saath khooni khel khelaa he
 According to DCP Vijay Kumar, police received information about the murder at 7

 In these notes, Upendra wrote that i have done all these murders

 According to the DCP, Upendra's wife Archana was suffering from diabetes and may be the cause of financial depression, depression and murder
 uski sabase badi beti kii umr 7 saal
 The second daughter was one and a half months old and the son was 5 years old

 Now he is being questioned
 system of air quality and wedar forcasting and research yani safar (SAFAR) india ne is baar diwali par pichley saal ke mukaable vaayu pradooshan kam rahane kaa purvanumaan jataayaa he
 According to SAFAR, the national capital Delhi is not receiving the same amount of polluted air from the surrounding areas as it did last year
 isaki vajah yah he ki is baar dilli ke upar diwali ke din uttar pashchimi hawaaen chal rahi hai, jinaki disha main lagaataar badlaav ho rahaa he
 Although casserole is continuously being burnt in the fields around Delhi, the wind will provide relief in the national capital
 iske alaava supreme court ne dilli-ensiaar memptaakhon kii bikri par bhi pabandilga di he
 Hence air pollution is more likely to be less than fireworks
 mausam vibhaag ke tahat kaam karne vaali safar agency ne teen sthitiyon kii pariklpana karte hue diwali ke din sambhavit vaayu pradooshan kaa akalan kiya he
 In the first situation, Safar envisaged that if people fireworks like 2016, then what will happen on Diwali in the year 2017? According to the travel, even if this happens, the direction of the winds towards Delhi is such that the pollution of the surrounding areas will not reach here as much as it reached last year
 aise main is sthiti main bhi jab log pichley saal kii tarah jamkar aatishbaajee karenge, to bhi is diwali main badali hui mausami paristhitiyon ke chalate pradooshan kam rahegaa
 In the second situation, Safar assessed that what would happen if fireworks remained just half of the year 2016? Apart from this, Safar envisaged in the third situation that what would happen if people do not fireworks than in 2016? After assessing these three conditions, Safar found that this time Diwali pollution will be less than last year
 aisi rahegi dilli kii aabhohawaasafar kii bhavishyavaanee ke mutabik agar pichley saal ke mukaable is baar log aatishbaajee bilkul na karen, to dilli kii hawa veri pur category main rahegi or yah sthiti 22 oktober tak bani rahegi
 In comparison, even if people do fireworks despite the Supreme Court ban and do the same as last year, even on Diwali, the air level will remain in the Very Poor category
 lekin diwali ke duusare din yah sthiti bhayanak hokar civvier condishan main pahunch jaaegi
 This situation will remain on 20-21 October, but on October 22, this pollution will improve if the air condition changes
 pradooshan ke liye aatishbaajee se zyada duusare kaaran jimmedaarsafar ke akalan kaa labboluab yah he ki aatishbaajee kii vajah se sthiti to hawa kii kharaab hoti he, lekin dilli kii aabhohawaa khatarnaak hone ke peeche aatishbaajee ke alaava duusare bade kaaran zyada jimmedaar hai
 The biggest reason for these causes of air pollution is the millions of vehicles operating in the capital Delhi and along with this, the air in delhi-ncr is poisoned by burning puva in the fields around Delhi before Diwali
 jab tak in kaarnon ko khatm nahin kiya jayega, tab tak rajdhani dilli main diwali ke aasapaas saaf hawa kii ummid karnaa bemaani he
 Do not run for 10 days on burning firecrackers, Sunita Narayan, the director general of her Center for Science and Environment, says that in recent days, several steps have been taken to stop pollution
 isamen rajya sarkaron dwaara uthaae gaye kadamon ke alaava supreme court kaa pataakhe par bain bhi shaamil he
 Sunita says that firecrackers should be banned and also applicable in the states
 saath hi yah vyavastha kii jaani chahie ki diwali main pataakhe jalaane vaale ko 10 din tak apni gaadi chalaani chhodani hogi, taaki aatishbaajee se hone vaale pradooshan ko kam kiya ja sake
 Steps taken to curb pollution Sunita says that everyone has supported the initiative taken to reduce pollution in Delhi
 jahaan ek ore bies-4 lagu kiye jane se pradooshan kam hua he, to duusari ore court ne pradooshan badhane par kadam uthaane ke liye plan banane ko kaha he
 It includes all the states of NCR
 lihaaja sabhi sarkarein mil-julkar pradooshan rokane ke liye kadam uthaane par vichaar kar rahi hai
 a forum has been created for this

 apane sansmaran 'da chlose aaf play' main riki ponting ne kaha ki vah yah nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki us vakt apil par sunwaayee ke dauraan sachin tendulkar ne harbhajan singh kaa saath kyon diya, jabaki match referi mike procter dwaara harfanmaulaa andrew symonds par kathith nasleey tippanee karne ke liye shuru main nilambit kiye jane par harbhajan singh khud hi chup rahe the
 Ricky Ponting said, "I don't understand why Sachin Tendulkar didn't tell this to Match Referee Mike Proctor earlier

 Ricky Ponting said of the incident that he found it strange when Harbhajan Singh was only fined after that incident, when the incident threatened to deteriorate relations between the two countries
 'daily telegraph' main chape kitaab ke anshon main riki ponting ke hawaale se kaha gaya, ''prashasnic galati kaa hawala dekar jaj ko harbhajan singh ke pichley kisi aparaadh ke bare main nahin bataaya gaya, jisase use vah sajaa nahin mili, jo milani chahie thi
 
 
 '' ponting ne aage likhaa he, ''shaayad 21veen sadi main bhartiya cricket kaa itnaa dabadabaa ho gaya tha ki use hilaayaa nahin ja saktaa tha, lekin phir maine sochaa ki kis tarah se khel main kai logon ne hamaari manshaa par sawaal uthaae
 
 
 How did they think that we want to take advantage of the series instead of working on the principles
 
 
 '' He said that the then Indian captain Anil Kumble's statement tarnished the image of the Australian team that Australia did not play with sportsmanship
 unhone kaha, ''mujhe lagata he ki mankigate maamle main kaaphi aadambar dekhne ko mila
 
 
 Harbhajan Singh was found guilty by Mike Proctor after examining all the evidence
 
 
 agle din bharatiyon ne daura chhodkar lautne kii dhamkee de di
 
 
 '' unhone kaha, ''anil kumble ke is bayaan ko kaaphi tavajjo mili ki australia ne khelbhaavna ke vipareet khelaa
 
 
 Later the perception quickly became that the controversy arose because of us, not by the decision of the proctor

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has started pushing towards making Sanskrit the lingua franca in the country
 jhuggi-jhopadiyon se lekar ab desh kii sabase badi panchayat sansad bhawan main bhi das din kaa shivi lagane kii taiyaari he
 This plan has been prepared by Sanskrit Bharati, a subsidiary organization of the RSS
 sansad bhawan main sanskrit sikhaane vaale shivi ke aayojan ke liye sangh isliye bhi utsahit he, kyonki is baar sansad main jahaan sanskrit main shapath lene vaale saansadon kii sankhya badi he, vahiin angreji main shapath lene vaale saansadon kii sankhya ghati he
 The Sangh is trying to have mps who take oath in Sanskrit more than English in the next Lok Sabha
 taaki angreji ke dabadabe ko chunauti dete hue desh main sanskrit ko lekar bada sandesh jaae
 All India Organization Minister Dinesh Kamat of Sanskrit Bharati has already met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in connection with setting up a lecture camp in Parliament House
 sanskrit bharti kaa yah prastaav om birla ko bha gaya he
 He has assured to organize a camp for ten days at the earliest
 darasal aresas kii koshishon ke chalate desh main sanskrit kaa prasar haalia varshon main badha he
 mps are beginning to feel interest and pride in taking oath in Sanskrit
 2014 main jahaan 34 saansadon ne sanskrit main shapath lee thi, vahiin is baar 2019 main 47 saansadon ne shapath lee
 Whereas only 54 mps took oath in English this time as compared to 114 in 2014
 17 veen loksabhaa main sabase zyada 210 saansadon ne hindi main shapath lee
 Thus, now there are only seven figures among mps taking oath in English and Sanskrit
 iske peeche aresas kii prerana bataai ja rahi he
 Union Health Minister Drs
 harshavardhan, pratap chand saarangi, gadhwal saansad or bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv tirath singh ravat, minakshi lekhi, pashchim bengal bijepi adhyaksh or midinapur saansad dilip ghosh aadi ne is baar sanskrit main shapath liya
 All such mps were also honored by Sanskrit Bharti at the Constitution Club in Delhi on Monday
 magar, sanskrit bharti desh kii sabase badi panchayat ke sabhi saansadon main sanskrit ke prati pyaar paidaa karne kii koshish main he
 What will the MP Sanskrit Bharti's Delhi Province Minister Kaushal Kishore Tiwari call aajtak
 in ko bataaya ki sansad bhawan main kul 20 ghanton kaa yah shivi das dinon tak chalegaa
 Every day for two hours, mps will be trained in writing, reading and speaking Sanskrit
 prashikshan sanskrit bharti se jude acharya denge
 He said that many mps expressed their willingness to organize this camp from the organization itself, after which this decision has been taken
 tiwari kehete hai ki bhashaa kaa prasar sirf likhane or padhane se hi nahin hota, balki bolne se hota he
 mps will be motivated to speak Sanskrit through this camp

 The Lok Sabha elections to be held next year in the country will be fought on principles and issues, and after winning the elections, they will decide on the Prime Minister in collaboration with allied organizations
 unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aakraamak hokar bijepi ko katghare main khadaa kiya he
 The Modi government will not be able to return to power again in 2019
 ajtak ke khaas kaarykram sidhi baat main rajasthan main congress kii satta main vaapasi ke baad upmukhyamantri pad par kabiz hone vaale sachin payalat ne madhya pradesh kii tarj rajya ke pradesh hone ke baavjood mukhyamantri nahin banane par kaha ki padhe-likhe yuva varg se jitne zyada log raajnneeti main aaenge, wo shubh sanket he raajnneeti ke liye
 The politics of each state is different
 madhya pradesh main jo faisla liya gaya wo vahaan kii raajnneeti ke aadhaar par liya gaya he
 The decision taken in Rajasthan is in the interest of everyone and the state
 pradesh main ham sabane milakar nirnay liya he ki aane vaale samay main ham kaise rajya ko behatar sarkaar den
 'no pique with CM' When the Chief Minister was made, there was no feeling of sadness on the face, the pilot said, 'what sadness
 main is baat kaa abhaari hum ki party ne mujhe is kaabil samajha
 The party has given important responsibility for this big state, so my effort is to discharge it properly
 ham acchhee sarkaar dene kii koshish karenge
 Regarding the dependence on Delhi for the state cabinet, he said that it has already been done and the final decision is taken by the Congress president
 rajya ke mukhyamantri ke saath koi manmutav nahin he
 Everyone is credited for the victory in the state
 agle aam chunaav se pehle 4 maheene ke mili samay par sachin payalat ne kaha ki sarkaar kii jo manshaa he wo shuru-shuru main dikh jaati he
 If we work away from the public by staying in big palaces, then the public will not accept it, but our determination, way of working and our behavior and government policy depends on how it is done
 kaam karne vaale babu to vahi rahenge, lekin nirbhar karata he ki inase kaam kaise liya ja saktaa he
 On the transfer of officers in Madhya Pradesh, he said that change is necessary at the administrative level, but the way of working is important how they can be used

 After the victory, it will be decided on the preparations for the next election of Netarahul Gandhi and on the question of the Prime Ministerial candidate, Sachin Pilot said that Rahul Gandhi never said that he should project him as Prime Minister
 diemke ne rahul ko pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ghoshit karne kii baat rakhi he
 But Congress and allied organizations have decided among themselves that after winning the election, the Prime Minister will decide by sitting together
 jeet ke baad hi tay hoga ki gathbandhan kaa netaa koun hoga
 He said that for the last nearly 30 years no Prime Minister from the Gandhi family has been formed, he has not become the Chief Minister
 har koi party ke liye kaam karata he or aaj kaa hamaara sangharsh satta hasil karne ke liye nahin he
 The system has to change because the atmosphere that BJP has created in the country today is not a good sign
 ham chunaav muddon or siddhanton par lard rahe hai
 Fighting with everyone
 agar samvidhan or desh ke sanvaidhanik sanghathanon ko nuksaan pahunchataa he to yah deshhit main nahin hoga
 If the trust of the organizations is not there, then how can the pilot believe that it is a big thing in Congress and BJP that we take everyone along
 endie main lagaataar tut ho rahaa he, abhi haal main upendra kushvaha ne daaman chhod diya he
 Shiv Sena and TDP have also left together
 shivasena ne saath choda hi hua he aap dekh lenaa
 Those who cannot get the trust of their partner organizations, how can they gain the trust of the people of the country
 inkaa samay aa gaya he
 The UPA is set to win the elections next year and the electoral outcome of these 3 states has made everything clear
 3 rajyon ke chunavi parinaam ke baadaraahul gandhike netritv par payalat ne kaha ki nishchit taur par lagata he, rahul gandhi ne teenon rajyon main hamaare chunavi abhiyaan ko shuru kiya
 He has aggressively raised the BJP in the dock
 unke netritv main hamane teenon rajyon main chunaav ladaa or jeet hasil kii
 His opponents and critics will have to agree that Rahul Gandhi proved that despite all the money and power, he won here
 rahul gandhi ke hindootvvaadi netaa banane parpayalatne kaha ki rahul ne hameshaa bhrashtachar, manhagaai, kisaanon ke mudde aadi par focus rakhaa he
 BJP is of caste-religion politics
 congress ne kabhi bhi dharm kii baat nahin kii
 The Congress is the only party that runs all together
 unhone kaha ki endie ko haraane ke liye sabhi vipakshi sanghathanon ko ekajute hona padegaa
 His blue eyes still have that dream of success, which is in every artist's eyes
 lekin fark yah he ki nil nitin mukesh ab bhi apni keemat teen karod ru
 And the film market is laughing at it as a joke
 nil ko apni nai film ke liye sin karne ke chakkar main lage ek nirmaataa se kahani sunne ke baad jab nil ne teen karod kii keemat maangi to usne thodi mohalat maangi
 In three days, she was among the buyers of the film market and was not willing to pay more than 50 lakhs of Neil
 ek kharidaar ne to khulkar kaha ki itani rakam bhi abbaas mastaan kii film (jisamen unke saath abhishek bachchan bhi hai) ke relies hone tak he
 If this film did not do anything amazing then Neil would have to suffer the loss of a zero out of 50
 vah produsar nil kaa khyaal chhod chukaa he or nil ab usase sampark kar rahe hai taaki keemat ko lekar kuch mol-bhav ho sake
 The savvy builder got Jai Ram ji and poor Neil with his own hands for Rs 50 lakh
 bhi phisalte najar aa rahe hai
 a few years ago in a weekly i read a story of Akanksha Pare Kashiv - Teen Saheliya: Three Lovers
 choti-si kahani thi ki ek restaraan main sardiyon kii dopaher main teen saheliyaan milti hai or apane-apane prem prasangon ke bare main bahut hi sahaj rup main baatcheet karti hai or kuch der baad ek-duusare se vidaa leti hai
 Very simple looking and devoid of any kind of extra drama
 iske baavjood kahani hamen ant tak baandhe rakhti he ki abhi kuch hoga
 No wonder, the story was conferred with Ramakant Smriti Samman in the same year
 aakanksha kii is pehali kahani ne hi vishwaas dilaa diya tha ki unki duusari kahaniyon main bhi sambhaavnaaon se rou-ba-rou hone kaa mauka milegaa
 Now he has a collection of 14 stories seventy-two beats seventy-three Armaan
 isamen bhi do-teen kahaniyon ko chhodkar kisi main bhi aisa nahin lagata ki charitron yaa sthitiyon main kahin se koi bahari naatakeeyata aropit kii gai he
 From this point of view, stories like Flower Girl, Dear Dad, Campus Love, Intermediate and love-business can be outlined
 ek sthiti kii shuruyaat hoti he, charitra aapas main milte hai or ant tak kuch bhi aisa ghatit nahin hota, jise saamaanya arthon main naatakeey kaha ja sake
 The stories of Amarkant immediately remind me of lunch
 prashn uthaaya ja saktaa he ki yadi kahani main apane aap main koi naatakeeyata nahin he to phir aisi kya baat he jo ant tak hamaari utsukata banaae rakhti he? mere vichaar main iske liye jimmedaar he kahaniyon kii sanrachana or shilp, jiske bheetar se ve apni kahaniyon kaa taana-bana bunati hai
 He has adopted a new style every time
 bahattar dhadakanen tihattar armaan main abhaya shukla or naureen kii apni-apni soch ke madhyam se kahani kaa aage badhanaa, dil kii rani sapanom kaa sahjada main theth khantee andaaj main prem-patron kaa aadan-pradaan yaa phir kathin ishk kii aasaan daastaan main ek sarkari college main padhaane vaale staff ke bich panpate prem sambandh hon—har kahani kaa shilp hi vah nirnaayak tatv he jis par jane-pahachaane, rosemara ke kathyon or kisse-kahaniyon ko ek nai tarah kii naatakeeyata hasil hone lagati he
 It is not that Akanksha has a lot of love stories, whenever he has the opportunity, he has also taken a deep review of the social, political situation
 dukaan vaali mausi ko hi len ki sampradayik dangon ke baad ek behad chirparichit mausi jaise paatr ko lekar logon kii soch kaise badal jaati he
 The title story itself, which involves first love, then marriage and finally separation between a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl
 donon hi isliye badi or gahari kahaniyaan ban jaati hai kyonki inamen kahin bhi sthitiyon, samasyaon par atishay bhavukta kaa leshmaatr bhi nahin, varan sahaj normal pratikriyaaon ke madhyam se sari sthitiyon par gaur kiya gaya he
 Here also those two stories cannot be left out which are the product of social media spread all around us
 control edilit ho yaa nigehabaani—donon kahaniyaan internet, twitor, instagram or audyogic yantrikta ke dabaav main hamaare jivan main chaati bhayavahata ko saamne laati hai
 All stories lead to aspiration and hope for a better future

 This statue will be placed on a 36 meter platform
 bataa den ki pichley saal yogi sarkaar ne 100 meter oonchi bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa lagane kii yojana kaa elaan kiya tha
 The Yogi government had also shown a proposal to Governor Ram Naik to promote religious tourism under the 'navya Ayodhya' scheme
 paryaton vibhaag kii ore se bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa ko lekar may 2018 main yojana banaai gai thi
 The statue will be installed on the banks of the Saryu River under the 'naya Ayodhya' scheme
 is par 330 karod rupye tak ke kharch kaa anumaan he
 Along with this, the government will make proper arrangements for Ramkatha Gallery, Tourist Accommodation, CCTV Camera, Police Booth, Traffic Means, and other civic facilities including toilets and drainage for security purposes

 # TZHA post shared by ali (@aliabbaszafar) on Dec 17, 2017 at 9:24pm PST In India, the value of coins has steadily decreased over the past few decades
 ab sikke se bahut kam hi chizein aisi hongi jo kharidi ja sakati ho
 Especially from low denomination coins
 har koi jaanata he ki sikke kaa mulya kya he kyonki wo usee par hi ukera rahata he
 But have you ever wondered how much it costs to make a coin? Can these costs be more than the value of the coin? To solve this riddle involving the cost of coins, India Today sought information from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Right to Information (RTI)
 hamane RBI se ye bhi jaananaa chaha ki maujuuda vakt main kis kis mulya ke sikkon kaa bharat sarkaar kii ore se nirmaan karaayaa ja rahaa he? beete 5 saal main aise kitne sikke dhaale gaye
 RBI sent our questions to all the mints of the country
 bhartiya sarkari taksaal, mumbai kii ore se jawaab diya gaya ki maujuuda vakt main 10 ru, 5 ru, 2 ru or 1 ru ke sikkon ko hi is taksaal main dhaala ja rahaa he
 In response, different value coins minted by Mint were also given in the last 5 years
 haalanki is taksaal ne sikkon par aane vaali laagat kii jaankaree gopneeyata kaa hawala dete hue dene se inkaar kar diya
 Mint said in response, "this information cannot be made available under section 8 (1) (d) of the RTI Act, 2005 as it is a trade secret
" hyderabad ke sarkari taksaal kaa javabaishbhi ne india today ke sawaalon ko hyderabad sthit ek or sarkari taksaal ko bhi bheja tha
 The same answer was also given by this mint that at the moment only four coins of value are being minted by him
 or wo sikke hai- 10 ru, 5 ru, 2 ru or 1 ru
 Hyderabad Mint also told how many coins of different value were minted in the last four years
 haalanki is taksaal ko mumbai taksaal kii tarah sikkon ke nirmaan par aane vaali laagat ko bataane main koi gurez nahin tha
 According to Hyderabad Mint, the average cost to make a 1 rupee coin is 1 rupee 11 paise
 saaf he ki is sikke kaa jitna mulya he, usase laagat zyaada he
 Average cost of production of coin is Rs

 Input: PTI pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ke rishte sabase nichle str par pahunch gaye hai
 He said this before leaving to attend the Shanghai Corporation Organization (SCO) summit in Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek
 is dauraan pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne yah ummid bhi jataai ki unke bhartiya samakaksh narendra modi loksabhaa chunaav main mili vishaal janadesh kaa istemaal pakistan ke saath kashmir samet sabhi vivaadit muddon ko sulajhane main karenge
 The Pakistani Prime Minister said that the SCO Summit has given him an opportunity to talk to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to improve relations between India and Pakistan
 pakistan ne har tarah kii madhyasthata ke liye rasta khol rakhaa he or bharat samet sabhi padosiyon ke saath shanti chahta he
 In an interview to the Russian news agency Sputnik, the Pakistani PM said that three minor wars have devastated India and Pakistan, due to which both countries are facing severe poverty
 modi or imran khan ke bich nahin hogi mulakatisase pehle pichley hafte bhartiya videsh mantralay ne bishkek main essio summit se itar pradhanmantri narendra modi or pakistani piem imran khan kii mulaakaat hone kii baat se inkaar kiya tha
 The Foreign Ministry had said that no bilateral talks were planned between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the SCO Summit in Bishkek
 isse pehle imran khan pradhanmantri narendra modi ko do baar khat likhakar kashmir samet sabhi vivaadit muddon par vaarta behaal karne kii maang kar chuke hai
 Kashmir is the cause of the india-pakistan dispute, while emphasizing on resolving the differences peacefully and through dialogue, Imran Khan said, 'the main dispute between India and Pakistan is about Kashmir
 agar donon deshon ke pradhanmantri or unki sarkarein faisla leti hai, to is mudde ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 But unfortunately we have not been able to do this so far
 haalanki ham ab bhi ummid karte hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi loksabhaa chunaav main mili vishaal janadesh kaa istemaal donon deshon ke rishte behatar karne or kshetra main shanti sthapit karne ke liye karenge

 haalanki rus saaf kar chukaa he ki pakistan se kareebi kaa bharat ke saath rishton par koi fark nahin padegaa
 Modi spoke to Chinese President - Pakistan to take action on terror
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of Pakistani infiltration and cross-border terrorism during a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, apart from SCO Summit
 unhone kaha ki bharat chahta he ki pakistan aatankwaad ke khilaaf thos karrwai kare, taaki donon deshon ke bich vaarta shuru karne ke liye aatank mukt maahaul ban sake
 Let us tell you that Pakistan is constantly demanding to resume talks, but India says that both cross-border terrorism and dialogue cannot go on simultaneously
 pakistan ko vaarta shuru karne se pehle aatankiyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 PM Modi and Imran Khan did not join hands; currently Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek to attend the SCO Summit
 essio summit ke pehle din yani guuruuvaar ko donon ek-duusare ke aasapaas or ek chat ke neeche najar aae, lekin haath nahin milaayaa
 Not only this, the conversation between the two was also not seen
 mahatma gandhi kii punyatithi yani 30 janvari jaise-jaise kareeb aa rahi he, madhya dilli main hindu mahasabha ke daftar main maahaul garma rahaa he
 She plans to install the idol of her most notorious member, Nathuram Godse, who murdered Gandhi, in offices in Delhi and Meerut
 haal ke dinon main prachaar paakar vah aise aaveg main he ki use parvaah nahin ki isse zyaadaatar haashie par pade rahane vaale in ugr dakshinpanthi sanghathanon kaa sab kuch taar-taar hi kyon na ho jaae
 These days when the BJP, formed in traditional right-wing politics, is trying to move ahead with a democratic face at the center, it will not be forced to deal with enthusiasts like Rajeshwar Singh of the RSS, but also against the hardline organizations like Hindu Mahasabha
 May have to take action
 rajeshwar ngkshasah ne haal main elaan kiya tha ki jald hi bharat ''hindu raashtra" ban jayega
 The result will be that the politics and good governance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who barely completed six months in the center, will be disturbed
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr punardharmantaran yaa 'ghar vaapasi' jaise vivaadon main jaaya ho chukaa he or ashanka he ki vipaksh inhen muddon ke bahaane bajet satr ko bhi barbaad kar saktaa he
 It is with this concern that Modi has spoken to the senior leadership of the RSS and said that they should keep their militant allied organizations under control
 modi ke kareebi bijepi ke ek netaa ne haal hi main ahmedabad main kaha, ''punardharmantaran kaa aisa khulaa abhiyaan puri tarah ulataa pad saktaa he kyonki isse na sirf isai mishnariyon ke kaam main nai teji aegi, balki modi ke sushasan ke agenda or unki antarrashtriya chhavi par bhi iskaa kaaphi asar padegaa
 Our agenda has to be taken forward quietly and without making headlines
 "lagata he ki aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ko kam-se-kam philhal yah baat samajh main aa gai he
 Not only has Rajeshwar Singh, a senior RSS pracharak, been sent on long leave, but this month at an RSS conference in Ahmedabad, Bhagwat did not even discuss 'homecoming'
 unhone apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri bane apane prachaarak kii loksabhaa chunaav main vishaal jeet kaa zikr kiya or kaha, ''hamen anukool paristhitiyon kaa laabh uthaanaa chahie
 "BJP president Amit Shah was present on the occasion
 punardharmantaran ke mudde par aresas ke kathith rup se palatney ke maamle main modi ke kareebi netaa ne sanket diya ki modi or aresas netritv main gambhir matbhed ubharne shuru ho gaye the kyonki rajeshwar jaise aresas padaadhikariyon ne apni harkaton se modi ke ghoshit aarthik vikaas ke rashtriya agenda se dhyaan bantaana shuru kar diya tha
 Modi's message to the RSS was conveyed by Amit Shah and RSS Sah Sarkaryavah and its coordinator Krishna Gopal from BJP
 krishna gopal pehle modi kii nirankush kaaryastylee ko naapsand karne ke liye jane jate the lekin ab ve hathiyaar daal chuke hai
 According to a leader close to Modi, Krishna Gopal proved to be helpful in sending Rajeshwar Singh on long leave
 lekin ek duusare aresas ke netaa naam na chhapane kii shart par bataate hai ki modi kii naaraazgi ke alaava rajeshwar aresas netritv kii najaron se bhi gir chuke hai
 The reason is that by 2021, his announcement of building a 'hindu Rashtra' was probably challenging the talk of Bhagwat himself
 aresas pramukh ne kolkata or ahmedabad main haal hi main kaha tha ki 'hindu raashtra' to sanathan satya he, bharat ke sabhi panth or dharm uski ikaiyaan hai yani vistrut parivaar ke sadsy hai
 However, the RSS leadership has realized that it needs to keep the Hindutva agenda under control
 isliye disambar main jab hindu mahasabha ne apane dilli, meerut or ambala (jahaan use faansee di gai thi) ke daftaron main godse kii murti lagane kaa elaan kiya to dilli main aresas ke think tanks india policy foundation ke diarector rakesh sinha ne twit kiya, ''kisi bhi hatyare kaa mahimamandan nahin hona chahie, chaahe vah linkan kaa ho yaa gandhi kaa
 Godse had no connection with the RSS
 "ek intervyuu main sinha ne godse ke mahimamandan kii koshishon par do-took raay rakhi
 He said, "there should be no temple of Godse
 ham use mahimamandit karke ulti dhara nahin baha sakate, chaahe vah kabhi rashtravaadi hi kyon na rahaa ho
 The fact that he killed the Mahatma is why we forgot his earlier contribution
 aresas kuch aapattiyon ke baavjood mahatma ko kaaphi sammaan kii najar se dekhtaa he
 "hindu Mahasabha General Secretary Madan Acharya retorted," The RSS should first be "brought back home" as it has ever descended from the Hindu Mahasabha
 " madan acharya ke khilaaf meerut police ne mahatma gandhi kaa apmaan karne ke liye mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 There is no doubt that Godse was a man between the Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS
 aresas chaahe jitna khandan kare par vah donon sanghathanon kaa sadsy rahaa he
 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the RSS Sarsanghchalak M
 at the time of Mahatma's assassination

 It was written in a letter to Golwalkar that the RSS people had distributed sweets after hearing the news of Mahatma's assassination

 Ashok Sharma, a member of the Hindu Mahasabha sitting there, says, "modi won this election not on his economic development promise, but on the agenda of Hindutva
" unhen yah samajhna chahie
 They should help us in carrying forward the agenda of Hindutva
 "isi tarah punjab main dharm jaagran manch ke rajya pramukh ram gopal ne kaha ki khaskar pakistan kii seemaa se sate ilaakon main rahane vaale sikhon ko dobaaraa hindu dharm main waapas laane kaa abhiyaan 2005 main tatkaaleen aresas pramukh ke

 Gopal and his army of 'swayamsevaks' first started the 'ghar Wapsi' campaign from Fazilka's Gurdwara
 ab gurdaspur, amritsar, batala, taran taaran, ferozepur or abohar main har saal unhone 2,000 logon ke dharmantaran main kamyaabi pai he
 However, on the issue of conversion, it can only be said that between Modi and the RSS, a temporary agreement was reached
 donon hi paksh use surkhiyon se alag rakhane par raji ho gaye hai
 As far as Godse's glorification of the Hindu Mahasabha is concerned, both the RSS and Modi know that they cannot allow another organization to take advantage of the Hindutva agenda
 yah poochne par sinha ne munh si liya ki agar hindu mahasabha godse kii pratimaa lagaataa he to aresas uske khilaaf koi kadam uthayega? aresas ke pravaktaa manmohan vaidya ise ''bemaani-mudda" kahkar khaarij kar dete hai
 An RSS leader, on the condition of anonymity, admitted that Modi is holding the reins in Delhi in the same way as he used to in Gujarat
 aresas netritv ko iskaa puraa ehsaas he
 According to these leaders, when Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he would have agreed on the promise of more importance at the Center to eradicate differences with the RSS, whether it is a matter of bypassing Vishwa Hindu Parishad's Praveen Togadia or the RSS pracharak of RSS in elections There should be a case of disregarding the advice or neglecting the demand of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, an affiliate of the RSS, against raising the electricity rates
 kuch maheene pehle aresas ke mahasachiv bhaiyaji joshi bangladesh seemaa par teen bigha hnetra dekhne gaye to seemaa surahna bal (biguef) ne unhen ''maujuuda surahna vyavastha" ke bare main vistaar se bataaya
 The RSS is also happy to see that many of its leaders have held positions of power and importance and Modi advises the RSS on many issues ranging from appointing governors
 ek aresas netaa ne kaha, ''yah hamaari sarkaar he
 After all, Modiji has been a pracharak for many years
 ham ek-duusare ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 Unlike Atalji, who runs a coalition government, Modiji has got an overwhelming majority and we are all together
 "modi ke kareebi netaa maanate hai ki pradhanmantri or aresas, donon ko ek-duusare kii darkaar he or zyaadaatar matbhed buniyadi nahin, ranneetiyon ko lekar hai
 They say that Modi had played its role in the beginning
 pichhali may main chunaav jeetne ke baad sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main bijepi ke nav-nirvaachit saansadon kii baithak main modi ne kaha ki ''1,200 saal kii gulaami" ke baad ek hindutv samarthak party satta main ai he
 The Modi government has overcome its initial problems in six months in power and it seems that it has now agreed to extensive consultations with the RSS on broad issues like education, culture, economy and national security
 lekin vah yah bhi jaanati he ki agar use apni chhap chhodmai he to use in tamaam maamalon, khaskar arthvyavastha main kamyaabi dikhaane kii jarurat he
 It is also certain that the failure will make him more dependent on the wishes of the RSS
 nae saal ke saath hi modi sarkaar kaa honeymoon daur biit chukaa he
 There are difficult and difficult paths ahead of him

 He said that industrialists should have a role in the education of the country
 apane baat ko rahul ne ek ghatana se spasht kiya
 He said, 'A friend of mine came from America and he wanted to get some engineering related things done
 maine unhen IIT main kisi professor ke paas jane kaa suzav diya
 When he went to an IIT professor, his work was done for only Rs 2000
 wo mitra mere paas aae or kaha ki mujhe bahut aashcharya hua ki meraa kaam keval 2000 rupee main ho gaya
 It would cost 30,000 rupees for this work in America
 ’rahul ne udyogpatiyon ko bataaya ki aisa isliye hua kyonki professor ko market kaa abhas nahin he
 Rahul said that industrialists should have a role in the education of the country
 rahul ne kaha ki aaj vishvavidhyalayon ko udyog jagat se jodne kii jarurat he
 Addressing the annual meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), Rahul said, 'when i went to university in the year 1991, nobody knew India, but now this is not the situation

 Within two days, two wing commanders of the Air Force have been caught in suspicious condition
 darasal pakistan desh ke sarahadi ilaake main jasusi ke nae-nae tareeke izaad kar rahaa he
 The latest among them is the Pakistan spy spy call center in Bahawalpur, the ISI headquarters
 is kol centre main jasusi ke liye baithe iesai agent din bhar sarahadi ilaakon main sainikon ko tarah-tarah ke laalach dekar yaa phir anjaan ban kar miss kol dekar phone karte rahete hai or ilaake se judi or sena ke movement se judi jaankaree lete rahete hai
 The Air Force has sought to stop calls from Pakistan and Bangladesh for this
 pehle jodhpur kaa airforce kaa wing commander sunil bhaati jasusi ke aarope main pakadaa gaya or ab airforce kaa hin wing commander shashaank shekhar pakistan jane ke chakkar main border par sriganganagar main pakadaa gaya
 Such incidents have already been reported in the Airforce earlier also
 inamen se zyaadaatar maamalon main jasusi ke fande main fansane kii shuruyaat phek kol se hui he
 In fact, Pakistan has opened a front of espionage against India, in which it is trying to collect information about the army in India without taking the risk of sending spies
 pakistani khufia agency kaa nayaa tarika he jasusi kaa kol centre jisamen bahawalpur main baithe inke trend log 24 ghante bharat ke sarahadi ilaakon main phone karte rahete hai
 Their aim is to gather information related to the Army and the Air Force and become a spy
 saath hin ye sena ke adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko nishaanaa banaate hai
 Not only this, people living in the border area also keep calling for movement and strategic information
 kabhi miss kol ke jariye dosti karte hai to kabhi lottery jeetne ke naam par
 In these areas, it is being told that the phones and mobile numbers that have 0092 / + 92 in front of them, do not talk to those numbers or even if it happens, do not give any information of any kind
 pakistan ke in napak harkaton kii vajah se raksha or grih mantralay ne tay kiya he ki sabhi suraksha agenciyon main collar idi vaale phone hin lagenge or saath main beasenel ko bhi nirdesh kiya he ki simavarti ilaake main logon ko bhi collar idi vaale phone hin die jaaen
 Airforce has asked BSNL to stop calls coming from the Pakistani code +92 forever
 pakistan ne ab ek nae saftware phone farak kaa istemaal karne laga he, jisamen kol to pakistan se aata he, lekin number bharat kaa hota he
 For example, spying calls came from a person from Jaisalmer from the number 091-9030040963 and 091-8885517481
 wo britain kaa pakistan banakar seemaa par sena ke movements ke bare main jaananaa chaah rahaa tha, lekin pataa karne par pataa chalaa ki ye kol pakistan se root kii gai thi
 BSF says that all the officers of BSF have been alerted for this as well as the district administration has also alerted all the police stations against this new spying operation of ISI
 is tarah kii ghatnaon ke baad raksha mantralay ne sabhi suraksha agenciyon ke liye nirdesh nikaala he ki koi bhi apane ghar par yaa daftar main anjaan kol atend nahin karegaa, saath hin simavarti ilaakon main bhi logon ko iske liye jaagruk kiya ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will perform special pooja of Pashupatinath in Kathmandu on the last Monday of the Sawan i
e
 August 4
 bataaya jaataa he ki sawan main pashupatinath ke darshan kaa vishesh mahatv he or yadi somvaar ko darshan ho to iskaa mahatv or bad jaataa he
 The temple administration is busy preparing special prayers for the pm's arrival to the temple
 haalanki sabase badi chunauti aakhri somvaar ko mandir main bhakton kii bheed ko sanbhaalanaa he
 According to Pandit Arjun Acharya, priest of Pashupatinath Temple, Modi will perform special puja on last Monday, which includes Jalabhishek and Rudrabhishek of Pashupatinath
 pradhanmantri 4 agast ko kareeb saadhe 9 baje mandir pahunchenge or aadhe ghante tak puja-archana karenge
 During this time the entry of common people in the temple will be stopped
 piem kii puja ke liye taiyaariyannarendra modi kii puja achche tareeke se ho iske liye pashupatinath kshetra vikaas kosh puri tatparta se laga hua he
 The priests in the Pashupatinath temple are South Indian Brahmins and will have full support for the worship of Modi, while it is reported that Modi will also bring a Pandit along with you for this special puja
 pashupatinath kshetra vikaas kosh ke adhyaksh govind tandon ke mutabik, pradhanmantri kii puja kii taiyaari jorshor se chal rahi he
 Extensive arrangements have also been made for security
 aakhri somvaari ke kaaran kareeb 3 lakh bhakt pashupatinath ke darshan ko aaenge
 In such a situation, there will be some problem with the arrival of PM, but the temple administration is apologizing to the devotees for this
 gauratlab he ki pashupatinath mandir jyotirling he
 It is believed that the philosophy of 12 Jyotirlinga benefits from their philosophy
 yahi nahin, yadi pashupatinath ke darshan chaar taraf se ki kiye jaae to chaaron dham kii yatra kaa fal miltaa he
 Man is not born in the animal yoni by the philosophy of Pashupatinath and it destroys the ego
 haalanki narendra modi himalay main agyaat vaas main rah chuke hai or sambhav he ki us dauraan vah pashupatinath ke darshan kar chuke honge, lekin pradhanmantri banane ke baad baba ke darshan se unhen vishesh laabh milegaa
 Modi will not be able to go to Janakpur
 On the other hand, pm's desire to go to Janakpur, the mother-in-law of Lord Ram and the land of Sita, can remain unfulfilled
 khabar he ki kharaab mausam or suraksha kaarnon ke kaaran piem kii janakapur or lumbani kii yatra sthagit kar di gai he, vahiin sambhav he ki pradhanmantri pashupatinath, janakapur or lumbani ke vikaas ke liye vishesh package kii ghoshnaa karenge

 ) purvi dilli ke mandavali ilaake main shanivaar kii subah ek agyaat shaks kii yearphone lagaakar railway trek paar karte samay train se kuchal kar maut ho gai
 The accident occurred around ten o'clock in the morning and the person is over 30 years old
 uski train se kuchal kar maut ho gai
 Eyewitnesses told police that they saw the person crossing the track with earphones
 police adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘ghatana ke baad hamen maukey se koi yearphone yaa mobile nahin mila
 Mobile can help us find out the identity of the person
 hamen mritak ke paas se koi pahchaan patr yaa anya dastavej baraamad nahin mila he’’ Does the ruling Janata Dal United in Bihar now consider its supremo Nitish Kumar as 'improvised' and 'temporary'
 ye sawaal somvaar ko party daphtar ke baahar lagaae gayi nae hording ke baad log puch rahe hai
 On Sunday evening, new hoardings were installed outside the party office in Patna, with the slogan, 'why should you think about it, Nitish Kumar'
 nishchit rup se jisane bhi slogan likhaa hoga usamen party ke varisht netaaon khaaskar nitish kumaar ke qareebi aaaraseepi singh ke sahmati se hi ye hording lagaayi hogi
 But the party leaders feel that this slogan is not digestible to the people
 thike kaa matlab bihar kii raajnneeti or gaanv ghar main yahi hota hai ki wo bahut achche to nahin lekin thik thaak kaamchalaoo hai
 This is the new slogan of Janata Dal United
 bihar main bahaar hai neetishae kumaar hai prashanth kishor kaa dimaag tha 
 But he has nothing to do with this new slogan

 twitter
 com / tjspohtrriunaka kahana he ki jahaan pichley vidhaan sabha chunaav ke dauraan ‘bihar main bahaar hai neetishae kumaar he' uske baad lok sabha chunaav ke dauraan ‘ sachcha he acha he nitish ke saath chale ‘ jaise naare ke saath hording poster lagaae gaye the
 At the same time, a word that has been used this time proves that Nitish Kumar's party also believes that he is no longer the best or efficient administrator, but he is just right in the political environment
 abhi tak party kaa yahi daawa tha ki bihar main nitish kumaar se behatar koi mukhyamantri nahin hua unase acha koi kushal prashaasak nahin he lekin jab party hi maan rahi ho ki wo thike hai to tab kya kahana
 However, Janata Dal United spokesperson Sanjay Singh says that this slogan is a symbol of aspiration of twelve crore people
 unhone yah bhi mana ki is slogan ke peeche party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor kaa koi lenaa dena nahin hai

 Chandrasekhar "ravan", founder of Bhima Army Unity Mission of Uttar Pradesh, recently says in a viral video made during his appearance on 8 November, "chandrashekhar Azad was not afraid of hanging so why should i fear Rasuka
 " pashchimi uttar pradesh main chandrashekhar or unka sanghathan ek baar phir surkhiyon main hai
 The reason is that the National Security Act (rasuka) should be imposed on him on behalf of the state government, soon after he got bail from the High Court
 maano siyasat chandrashekhar kaa peechha chhodie ko taiyaar nahin he
 It seems that political forces want to woo the Dalits on the one hand, but on the other they want to suppress their young face Chandrashekhar
 usee video main chandrashekhar kehete hai, ''sarkaar nahin chaahati ki main jail se baahar niklun
 "actually, Chandrasekhar was arrested on 8 June 2017 from Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh by the STF (special Task Force) on charges of ethnic violence in Saharanpur in May 2017
 sabhi maamalon main court se jamaanat milane ke baad rihaai kaa farmaan aane se pehle hi jila prashasan ne un par rasuka ke tahat karrwai kaa notice taamil kara diya
 Before this action, Chandrasekhar had threatened his life in jail
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki jis vyakti ko khud apni jaan ke khatre kii ashanka ho, usase achaanak rashtriya suraksha ko khatra kaise ho gaya? or agar rashtriya suraksha ko nahin to phir khatra kise he?haal hi main 27 aktubar ko chandrashekhar ko pet main gambhir sankraman ke chalate achaanak jila jail se ilaaj ke liye saharanpur jila aspataal laayaa gaya or isiu main bhartee kar diya gaya
 It was only a week after he was shifted to jail after treatment that on November 7, at night, he was referred from Meerut Medical College for treatment at the Meerut Medical College
 un par 21 mukademe darj hue the or esaity kii vivechna ke dauraan inhen paanch mukademon main nihit kar diya gaya tha
 Chandra Shekhar advocate Harpal Singh Jeevan says, "in one case, SGM has been granted bail by Saharanpur court and the remaining four have been granted bail on 30 October and 2 November from the Allahabad High Court
" " hycourt se jis din jamaanat hui, usee din jila magistrate pi
 K
 pandeya ne chandrashekhar ko rasuka ke tahat niruddh karne kaa aadesh diya
 Pandey, referring to the cases registered on him in the order, wrote, "for the purpose of maintaining the general public order affected by Chandrashekhar's crime, i have been disallowed on behalf of the National Security Act in the public interest
 " tajjub ki pandeya ke is aadesh main jin keson kaa zikr kiya gaya he, unamem chandrashekhar ko jamaanat mil chuki he
 Joint Director (prosecution) o
 pi
 Mishra says, "rasuka's action is not abrupt
 ise dehaat kotwali ke esao puttan laal verma ne prastaavit kiya tha or yah espi city, esaspi ke anumodan ke baad jila magistrate ke paas pahunchi
 The public order was not disrupted, so the DM issued orders
 "lekin baat sirf chandrashekhar tak simit nahin lagati
 In fact, Rasuka's action on Chandrasekhar was taken when the civic election process has started in Uttar Pradesh and no major political party can remain in the contest without adding Dalits
 shuru se bhim army or chandrashekhar ke samarthan main khadey rahe upi congress ke pradesh upaadhyaksh or purv vidhayak imran masood ise rajnatik durbhaavna ke tahat kii gai karrwai qaraar dete hai, ''prashasan ne rasuka jaise gambhir kanoon ko majaak banaakar rakh diya he
 The government is bent on suppressing the voice of democracy by creating conditions like emergency
 pehle dange ke aaropee thakur yuvakon par rasuka lagaai or ab balance karne ke liye chandrashekhar ko niruddh kar diya
 "chandrasekhar, who was detained in Rasuka, is not the only one, but three Thakur youths Sudhir, Raju and Sonu were accused of committing violence against Dalits in Shabbirpur on 8 September
 unke saath dalit paksh ke aropiyon main shabbirpur ke pradhan shiv kumaar or ek anya yuvak sonu par bhi rasuka kii karrwai hui
 But in Chandrasekhar's case, the wait was done
 sawaal yah he ki jin aaropon main chandrashekhar ko jamaanat mil gai, unke aadhaar par hi unhen rasuka main kyon niruddh kiya gaya? bhim sena ke ek netaa satish gautam do-took kehete hai, ''bhaajapa sarkaar nahin chaahati ki chandrashekhar jail se baahar aakar daliton ke adhikaron kii ladaai laden
 Fearing that Dalits would gain strength in the civic elections due to their exit, the state government has misused the administrative machinery
 " haalanki abhi rajya or centre stareey standing council se rasuka sambandhi adeshon kaa satyaapan hona he or 12 din ke bheetar chandrashekhar paksh kii ore se dm ko jawaab bhi diya janaa he, lekin kanoon ke jaankaron kii maane to yah aadesh bhavishya main police prashasan kii kaabiliyat par sawaal jarur uthaaenge
 Actually, the BJP did an experiment in Saharanpur as soon as the civic elections were called
 bhaajapa saansad raghav lakhanpal sharma kii aguai main april maah main nagar nigam kshetra ke gaanv sadak doodhli main jabaran ambedkar shobhaayatra nikaali gai jise lekar sampradayik hinsa ho gai thi
 The MP sat on a sit-in at the residence of the then SSP Luv Kumar and his supporters vandalized the SSP residence
 is maamle main bhaajapa ko daliton kaa samarthan nahin mila or ulate saansad ko mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii naaraazgi bhi jhelni padi thi
 The mps wanted their Anuj Rahul Lakhanpal to contest the election of Mayor
 par saharanpur ke pehle meyar kii kursi ati pichhadaa varg ke liye arakshit ho gai
 Dalit voters are decisive here
 na keval yahaan balki pashchimi uttar pradesh kii siyasat par dalit vot asar daalate hai
 Chandrasekhar's name is associated with Dalit identity and which can affect Dalit voters
 lekin daliton ko apane paale main karne kii bhaajapa kii ranneeti 5 may, 2017 ko saharanpur ke shabbirpur gaanv main daliton or thakuron ke bich hue jaateey hinsa ke baad ulta pad gai
 At that time local SDM Manoj Singh was allowed to celebrate Maharana Pratap Jayanti in a room in the Inter College in Shimlana, a neighboring village of Shabbirpur, but no procession was allowed
 is kaarykram main phulan devi kaa hatyara sher singh rana bhi tha, jo parole par he
 After the clash, Dalits were attacked by a mob of Thakurs who arrived in Shabbirpur from nearby villages
 daliton ke pachaas se adhik ghar jala die gaye or darjanon dalit jakhmi hue the
 a Thakur youth was killed by suffocation

 Angry Dalits protested fiercely
 chandrashekhar ne 21 may ko dilli ke jantar mantar par daliton kii baari bheed jutakar rajya sarkaar ko lalakaara tha
 As a result, BSP chief Mayawati also had to visit Shabbirpur
 unki sabha se laut rahe daliton par bhi suniyojit hamale hue or ek yuvak kii hatya kar di gai thi
 On 18 July, Mayawati resigned from the Rajya Sabha membership, saying, "I wanted to put the matter of oppression of the exploited, laborers, peasants and Dalits in the House
" shabbirpur ke dalit utpeeda kii baat uthaanaa chaahati thi, par satta paksh ke sabhi log ek saath khadey ho gaye or mujhe bolne kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 "in this case the BSP woke up late, rather he was forced to wake up by Chandrashekhar's new Dalit avatar
 tab tak congress ke pradesh upaadhyaksh imran masood ne chandrashekhar kaa samarthan kar dalit sahanubhuti kaa daanv chal diya tha
 However, Congress National Vice President Rahul Gandhi was unable to visit Shabbirpur and had fallen behind Mayawati in reaching Saharanpur
 jaahir he, chandrashekhar ke bahaane chunavi bisaat par dalit hi hai or nikaay chunaavon main unki nirnaayak bhoomika he
 In such a situation, Chandrasekhar is feeling the danger and he is also facing danger from Chandrasekhar

 unhone film musafir main kishor kumaar or dilip kumaar ko cast kiya tha
 Very few people will know that the script of the film was written by Ritwik Ghatak
 film ko kaaphi unic dhang se filmaaya gaya tha
 The film was well liked
 musafir ruthvik ke kariyar kaa terning point sabit hui thi
 Apart from film direction and script writing, Ritwik Kamal was also an actor
 unhone chinnamul film main acting kii thi
 Russian film maker Vsevolod Pudovkin liked the film
 unhone ruthvik ke abhinay kii tarif kii thi
 Also, this film was later released in Russia
 iske alaava or bhi filmon main unke abhinay kii prashansa kii gai
 Ritvik also taught at Film and Television Institute of India, Pune
 is dauraan unhone fier naam kii ek 35 minute kii short film banaai thi
 One coincidence in the film was that comedian Asrani and director Subhash Ghai also acted in it
 baad main donon apni apni field main janaa pahachaanaa naam bane
 During that time, both institutions were also winners
 ruthvik ne ek intervyuu main ye bhi kaha tha ki ve har din ek short film bana sakate hai
 It used to be a good practice for students to learn
 ‘ajantrik naam se bani unki is bengali film ko science fiction par banaai gai bhartiya cinema kii pehali film maani jaati he
 The film received a special entry at the 1959 Venice Film Festival
 iske alaava unhone paanch play bhi likhe
 She wrote plays named 'charter' (dalil), 'communication' (sanko), 'agony' (jwala), 'ablaze' (jwalanta) and 'that Woman' (shei Meye)
 theatre or cinema ke kshetra main rithwik kaa kaam athulaneey or awwal darje kaa rahaa
 He died on 6 February 1976 at the age of 50
 patni kii jasusi karaane ke aaropon par bollywood actor navazuddin siddiqui kii safai ke baad unki patni aalia kaa riection saamne aayaa he
 He has surprised the whole matter by writing a post on Facebook
 aalia ne likhaa, kal se media main jo bhi khabaren chal rahi hai use dekhakar navaj ke saath main khud hairaan hum
 In the past, many types of things have come up in the media about me and Nawaz
 jinamein talaak se lekar hamaare saath na rahane jaisi kai baaten kahi gayi, lekin kal se jo news fail rahi hai wo ham donon ke liye hairaan karne vaali raheen or majaboor hokar mujhe aaj apni khamoshi ko todna padaa
 Alia further wrote, He was also criticized a lot recently for his biography
 navaj kaa kusur sirf itnaa tha ki wo sach bolte hai
 There is no lie inside them
 lekin bajaae unhen samajhane ke unako galat tehra diya gaya
 My and Nawaz's relationship is 15 years old
 jab navaj kuch bhi nahin the, ek chote se ghar se shuru hui hamaari prem kahani main kai utaar chadhaav rahe
 But after a long relationship, we finally got married
 navaj ne bhi kariyar kii bulandiyon ko chhu liya
 What was lacking a lot was fulfilled by the birth of our two children Shora and Yanni
 patni kii jasusi karwaane ke aarope par bole navazuddin siddikiapani fasebuk post main aalia ne likhaa ki nawaz duniya ke liye aaj ek cilabrity hai lekin unke liye aaj bhi vah nawaz hai
 He wrote, The good thing that i always liked about Nawaz is his open views
 unhen jitna apana spes pasand he dusron ko bhi wo utana hi spes dete hai or iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan he ham donon kaa dharm
 He told, i am from a Hindu Brahmin family, while Nawaz is a Muslim
 lekin navaj ne kabhi mere alag dharm se hone kaa mujhe ahsaas nahin hone diya
 Nor did he ever try to impose his religion on me
 wo jitna apane dharm ko maanate hai vahi rispect wo mere dharm ko bhi dete hai
 Referring to the strength of their relationship, he wrote in the post, This is the foundation of a strong relationship between us
 isi baat ne achche pati or pita ke saath saath unhen ek behtareen insaan banaaya he
 Probably because despite being a celebrity, he could not dominate any kind of stardom
 aaj bhi unke vahi puraane dost hai
 Those are small hobbies
 vahi simple si unki life he
 Finally, Alia wrote, Nawaz is still the same Nawaz
 rahi baat sidiaar se judi is nai controvarsi kii to sachai jald sabake saamne aa jaaegi bas mai yahaan itnaa hi kahuungi ki navaj par lagaae gaye iljaam puri tarah se jhuthe or bebuniyaad hai
 Being a celebrity, he has been made a soft target
 navaj ne kii media ke ravaiye kii aalochanise puure maamle par actor navaj ne puure media ke ravaiye kii aalochana karte hue ise ghrunit qaraar diya tha
 He did his part by posting a picture on social media while spending time with his daughter at school
 navaj bole mujhe hairaani he ki media kuch aaropon ko lekar mere upar sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 Disgusting
 Last evening, i was helping my daughter to prepare her school project Hydroelectric Power Generator & went to her school this morning for Project Exhibition
 To my surprise the media had questions about some random allegations on me # Disgustpic

 Pranab said, other countries came to know about its (terrorism's) heinousness and dangerous consequences later, whereas India has to face this war much earlier than that
 pranab ne kaha ki bharat ke logon ne ghaavon kaa dard sehate hue paripakvata kaa udhaaharan prastut kiya he
 Those who incite violence and incite hatred must understand the truth
 varshon ke yuddh ke mukaable shanti ke kuch kshanon se kahin adhik uplabdhi praapt kii ja sakati he
 India is complacent and driven by the desire to sit on the highest peak of prosperity

 There is no greater humiliation than hunger
 suvidhaon ko dhire-dhire neeche tak pahunchane ke siddhanton se garibon kii nyaaysangat aakankshaon kaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 We have to uplift those who are poorest, so that the word poverty is erased from the dictionary of modern India
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki hamaara vikaas vaastavik lage, iske liye jaruri he ki hamaare desh ke garib se garib vyakti ko mahasoos ho ki vah ubharate bharat kii kahani kaa ek hissaa he
 Later the Hindi translation of his speech was read by Vice President Hamid Ansari
 pranab ne kaha, meri raay main shiksha vah mantra he, jo bharat main aglaa swarna yug laa saktaa he
 In our oldest texts, the structure of society is erected on the pillars of knowledge

 Talking about corruption, he said that sometimes the weight of the post falls on the dreams of the person
 bhrashtachar ek aisi buraai he, jo desh kii manodasha main niraashaa bhar sakati he or isaki pragati ko baadhit kar sakati he
 We cannot sacrifice our progress due to the greed of some people
 tippaniyan He ended the speech with the well-known metaphor of Swami Vivekananda, in which he said that India would rise
 sharir kii takat se nahin, balki man kii takat se
 Not from the flag of demolition, but the flag of peace and love

 Upon reaching there, Kapadia, Ansari and Meera Kumar welcomed him and accompanied him to the Central Hall

 Pranab said that the people of India have presented an example of maturity with the pain of wounds
 jo hinsa bhadakaate hai or ghrinaa failaate hai, unhen ek sachai samajni hogi
 Far more than a few moments of peace can be achieved by years of war
 bharat aatmasantusht he or samruddhi ke oonche shikhar par baithne kii ichha se prerit he
 It will not be deterred due to dangerous people spreading terrorism in its mission
 kaali bhavy achkan or safed jhak chudeedaar pajame main pranab mukherjee ne jaise hi shapath puri kii, kaksh main baithe sabhi logon ne megen thapthapaakar or taaliyaan bajaakar unka swaagat kiya

 In his speech, the President said that the curse of poverty has to end and create such opportunities for the youth so that they take our India forward at a rapid pace
 bhukh se bada koi apmaan nahin he
 The principles of gradually bringing facilities to the bottom cannot solve the legitimate aspirations of the poor
 hamen unka utthan karnaa hoga, jo sabase garib hai, taaki garibi shabd aadhunik bharat ke shabdkosh se mit jaae
 The President said that our development should be real, for that it is necessary that the poorest person in our country should feel that he is a part of the story of emerging India
 baad main unke bhaashan kaa hindi anuwaad uparashtrapati hamid ansaari ne padhaa
 Pranab said, in my opinion education is the mantra that can bring the next golden age in India
 hamaare pracheenatam granthon main samaaj ke dhaanche ko gyaan ke stambhon par khadaa kiya gaya he
 Our challenge is to spread knowledge to every corner of the country and turn it into a democratic force
 bhrashtachar kii charchaa karte hue unhone kaha ki kabhi-kabhi pad kaa bhaar vyakti ke sapanom par baari pad jaataa he
 Corruption is an evil, which can fill the mood of the nation and frustrate its progress
 ham kuch logon ke laalach ke kaaran apni pragati kii bali nahin de sakate
 The comments bhaashan kaa ant unhone swami vivekanand ke suprasiddh roopak se kiya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki bharat kaa udai hoga
 Not by strength of body, but by strength of mind
 vidhwans ke dhvaj se nahin, balki shanti or prem ke dhvaj se
 Collect all the powers of goodness

 Green, blue or red, but also mix all the colors and create a bright glow of white, which is the color of love

 Somewhere there is a struggle to save the dam from breaking, while somewhere, trying to get out of the village and evacuate people in the middle of the sharp edge of the Ganges
 kahin chhaton par jame pariwaron tak khaanaa pahunchane kii jaddojahad, to kahin maweshiyon tak chaara le jane kii koshish, koi ghar chhodane ko taiyaar nahin to koi ghar jane ko taiyaar nahin kyonki ganga ne kai bastiyon ke namonishaan mitaa die hai
 The flood-affected villages in Ballia district are different but everyone's pain is one, everyone's story is one
 upi kaa baliya jilabaki bheeshan vibhishika jhel rahaa he
 All the villages on the banks of the Ganges in the district are in the grip of floods, somewhere the Ganges has engulfed the entire village, somewhere people are trying to save the dam from the erosion of the Ganges so that their village does not get hit by water
 kai gaanv aise mili jahaan logon ke paas naaven nahin hai to rasse ko pakadakar tejadhaar ko paar karne kii chunauti he
 Hridaypur village Hridaypur village in Ballia district is adjacent to the Ganges dam where water has engulfed the entire village
 nadi kii dhar itani tej he ki agar paanv phislaa to phir maut tay he, logon ke paas naavon kii suvidha nahin he ki log gaanv aa-ja sake
 In such a situation, the villagers together got out of the way so that people could get out of the village safely

 The village head says that there is neither arrangement of boats nor arrangements are being made to transport logistics to the villages

 But the floods have worsened the situation here

 The big houses are completely immersed and people have taken shelter on their roofs

 All the houses are filled with 5 to 6 feet of water and the high tide of flood is also hollowing out the houses
 alam ye he ki raahat or bachaav kii aas main logon ne apane makaanon ke upar sharan le rakhi he
 People are forced to stay on the roofs by putting up tents because the entire house is filled with water several feet, neither can take the risk of getting into the house nor coming out of the village

 The waves of Ganga Ganges are continuously cutting this Dubey Chapra village, but hundreds of sacks planted with the help of administration and people have kept the dam from breaking

 What to wear before going to work, what not? What to ask before ordering food, what not? Whether to go after reservation or not? And the biggest thing is that you keep changing your opinion about the relationship
 jaise ek vyakti kuch samay (kuch din-maheene) aapako acha laga or phir uske bare main aapaki raay badal gai
 Especially in love relationships, this 'confusion' can be overwhelming
 relationships thirepist ise sambandhon ke liye khatre kii ghanti ke rup main dekhte hai
 And it is more dangerous when you break up with the same person again and again
 rahaa bhi naa jaae or saha bhi naa jaae, aisa sirf filmon main hi acha lagata he
 In psychology, this attitude of yours is called 'recycling relationship'
 jaraa sanbhalkar, asal jindagi main yah kanfusion aapaki jindagi ko tabah kar saktaa he
 If you are going through all these confusions day by month and year then it should be taken seriously rather than in laughter
 kabhi-kabhaar agar aapako aisa mahasoos hota he to koi baat nahin lekin agar yah kanfusion aapaki rosemara kii jindagi kaa hissaa ban gaya he to phir iskaa solution aapako jald se jald khoj lenaa chahie
 In psychology, this stage is called delirium i
e
 'acute confusion state' or 'acute brain syndrome'
 imoshans ko lekar kai artical likh chuki dow
 Mary C
 Limia says, "if you repeatedly breakup with the same person or different people and then start persuading them, then you should think deeply about this relationship
 lekin usase bhi zyada sochane kii jarurat aapako apane imoshans ke asthir rahane ke bare main he
 Your brain is not a victim of confusions
 ''darasal 'kanfusion' hone par dar or gussa do imoshan hamaare andar paidaa hote hai
 Think of this example as if you go to buy a car
 aapako uskaa rang nahin pasand
 But your friends tell you that Dekh Bhai is the last vehicle of this brand
 agar chook gaye to phir maheenon itanjar karnaa padegaa
 The pressure is on you to turn your dislikes into an opportunity
 aap us car ko khone ke dar se kharid to lete hai lekin us gusse kaa kya karenge jo aapaki pasand kaa rang naa milane kii vajah se paidaa hua
 You will remember the car of your choice, and if you see a car of that color with someone else, then your own car will be momentarily annoyed
 yahi kuch sambandhon man bhi hota he
 If you have fallen in love with someone because of fear or pressure, then you will not be able to live with him in a stable emotion
 gussa haaavee hoga to usase brake-ap kar lenge or phir vikalpaheenata kaa dar paidaa hoga to use manaane daud padenge
 Many times you will go through a break-up relationship, leaving one second and then the other third and then not knowing
 kanfusion hi he koi pahaad to nahin jo tuutegaa hi nahin
 
 
 Instead of suppressing the fear and anger arising from Confusion, it needs to be analyzed in depth
 jaahir aap khud nahin kar paaenge lekin kanfusion ke is daur se aap guzar rahe hai to kisi manovaigyanik se salaah len
 Because delirium ie 'acute confusion state' is not incurable
 thirapist aapako dar or gussa donon imoshans ko pahachaanakar vaastavik pyaar vaali feeling jagaane main madad karegaa
 Even if you are looking for a life partner and if you have chosen a partner, then the thirapist will be helpful for you in both the situations

 noida athurity kaa sabase bada bakaaedaar he unitech grupanoida sector-113 main aavantit jameen ko nirast kiya he21 oktober ko athurity ne jari kiya tha cancellation letternoida athurity ne apane sabase bade bakaaedaar unitech group par badi karrwai kii he
 The Authority has canceled the land allotted to Unitech Group in Noida Sector-113
 saath hi group houseing ke nirmaan ke liye aavantit kiye gaye plot number jiech-01 ko radd karke 15 din main jameen kaa kabja waapas lene ke nirdesh die hai
 Due to these reasons, the action was taken by the Noida Authority on October 21 in relation to this action, which was informed on October 30
 is hisaab se agle 6 dinon yani 5 november tak athurity ise apane kabje main lene kii prakriya shuru kar sakati he
 Noida Authority to cancel allotment of land, outstanding installments of land, interest, leaserant, 64
 7% pratikaar (kisaanon ko court ke aadesh ke mutabik badha hua muaavja) or samyavriddhi shulk ke 1203
 45 crore has been declared as the reason
 saath hi athurity ne tay miyaad main project puraa karke abhiyog praaanpatr (OC) naa lene ko bhi cancellation kaa kaaran bataaya he
 The Unitech Group is also accused of starting the construction of 17 towers without passing the map
 is tarah nirmaan karke unitech ne building regulation act kaa bhi ulanghan kiya he
 Not only this, Unitech has given 19,181 against the rules to m / s Sethi Residency and m / s GMA Developers on the land allotted to them
 50 varg meter jameen bech di
 No action was given to the notice
 Before this action, the Noida Authority had issued a notice to Unitech on August 24 and directed to file its reply, but no one from the jailed Unitech promoters tried to answer it
 athurity ne unitech se koi bhi santoshjanak jawaab naa milane or unitech kii taraf se bakaayaa bhugtan par kabhi bhi koi thos yojana naa milane par ab jameen aavanton radd karne kii karrwai kii he
 After this action, now not only Unitech but also home buyers of other developers who are building the project in this plot, a crisis has arisen
 philhal main supreme court main maamla lambit he
 The Supreme Court had rebuked the authority
 Let me tell you that in the Amrapali case, the Supreme Court had repeatedly reprimanded the Noida Authority
 court ne kaha tha ki agar athurity ne apni jimmedaari nibhaai hoti to is tarah se hajaaron ghar kharidaaron ko yun dar-dar kii thokaren naa khaani padatin
 In such a situation, now the Noida Authority is continuously taking action to issue the recovery certificate and cancel the land allotment before proving any further negligence
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne mangalagavar ko rashtriya janata dal (rajd) sansthaapak lalu prasad yadav par mujffarnagar dangon ko lekar raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unhen khub khari-khoti sunaayi or kaha ki danga peediton ko sarkaar dwaara di gai madad kii jaankaree hone ke baavjood vipakshi netaa is mudde par siyasat kar rahe hai
 Yadav said at a function organized at the SP state headquarters on the 27th death anniversary of socialist leader Rajnarayan that socialists do not go anywhere except their policies
 ve nitiyon ko chhodkar satta nahin chaahate hai, lekin rajd netaa lalu prasad yadav to satta ke liye bhaajapa ke bhi najadik ho gaye the
 He lashed out at Lalu, saying, "despite the government helping the Muzaffarnagar riot victims so much, any aira-gaira does politics there
" kuch log jail se nikalakar sidhe mujffarnagar pahunch gayi
 Lalu had said that he would not allow Mulayam to become Prime Minister
 lalu congress kii chapalusee main lag gayi hai
 Now they have nothing left
 ' Yadav said that out of all the riots that have taken place since independence in the country, no government has given any riot victims to Muzaffarnagar victims
 unhone kaha, 'aisi kshatipurti kabhi kisi duusari sarkaar ne nahin kii he
 We distributed 90 crore rupees together
 vipakshi netaaon ko yah sab pataa to he lekin tab bhi ve raajnneeti kar rahe hai

 ' yadav ne kaha ki raajnneeti main shakti kii hi puja hoti he, kamjor ko koi nahin puujata
 Therefore increase the strength of SP
 sapa pramukh ne kaha ki china bharat kii seemaa main 19 kilometre andar tak ghus aayaa he
 The central government is timid
 jab suraksha sambandhi baithak hoti he to koi kuch nahin bolta
 Pakistan beheaded our jawan
 iske alaava sarkaar mahangaai or bhrashtachar rokane ke morche par bhi naakaam rahi he
 He reiterated that the BJP will get some edge in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, but it will not be able to form the government as there is no other party with it
 chunaav baad kendra main teesraa morcha hi satta main aayegaa
 Highlighting the personality of socialist leader Rajnarayan, Yadav said that he fought against injustice throughout his life
 vah aakshark bhaashan dete the
 He was of a bizarre personality and needs inspiration from him
 unhone kaha ki rajanarayan ne indira gandhi ko chunaav main haraaya tha
 Made significant contribution to the country
 bina jokhim uthaaye koi bhi bada netaa nahin ban saktaa
 On this occasion, Chief Minister and SP President Akhilesh Yadav said that only socialist people are giving strength to democracy
 satta main hone kii vajah se unke saamne chunautiyaan bhi hai
 There are many people who we have to compete with
 unhone kaha ki sabhi samaajwaadiyon kii koshish honi chaiye ki uttar pradesh ke alaava anya pradeshon main bhi falkar samaajwaad kii takat ko badaye
 Only socialist people can show the way
 akhilesh ne kaha ki pradesh kii pichhali mayawati sarkaar ne sahakaarita andolan ko khatm kar diya tha or panchayatiraj ko nasht kar diya tha
 SP has revived him as soon as he comes to power
 jo sahakaari bank band ho gayi the unako dobaaraa kholaa gaya
 He said, 'there are only two-three months left for the Lok Sabha elections
 agar ham loksabhaa chunaav main kaamyaab hue to pradesh main agali sarkaar bhi banane main safal honge
 Our responsibility is big
 
 
 jab tak hamaare sabhi saathi milakar nahin ladenge, tab tak ham kaamyaab nahin ho sakate
 If SP has to become a big force, then the Lok Sabha elections are a big opportunity
 ' The Chief Minister took a dig at the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi and said, 'recently a cartoon was published in a newspaper that there is a party in Delhi which is standing at the crossroads, and she is sending SMS by asking the public on which way Go

 He said that if the Congress gives him a ticket from Budhni, he can defeat Shivraj
 'tikat vaapasi' par video jari kiya thorjun arya ne beete ravivaar ko ek video jari kiya tha
