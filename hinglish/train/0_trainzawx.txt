 But this fight of both of them will turn into Pooja's death in the morning, she did not even think that herself
 pehle se shaadishuda he inspector amitbharat ne khulaasa karte hue bataaya ki amit pehle se shaadishuda he
 He also has two children
 aise main amit or puja ne aapas main shaadi kii hogi, aisa use nahin lagata he
 But aside from this statement of Bharat, the revelation of Pooja's sister-in-law Usha on Wednesday is also not surprising in itself
 ushaa ne kaha tha ki use khud puja ne bataaya tha ki amit ne uske saath chupake se shaadi kar lee thi or usne ek baar aborshan bhi karavaaya tha
 According to the mouth-sister-in-law, Pooja had also sent her and Amit's wedding photos
 koun he bankijis banki naam ke ladke ko lekar amit or puja ke darmyaan us raat ladaai ho rahi thi, vah marchent navy main kaam karata he
 His real name is Yatendra
 vah chunki barabanki kaa rahane vaala he, isliye use uske dost banki ke naam se pukaarte hai
 According to Bharat, he and Banki met only during journalism
 donon achche dost the
 But just because of this it is not right to point fingers at Pooja
 shaq ke ghere main inspector amitis maamle main inspector amit kii bhoomika pehle din se hi sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 Despite this, the Faridabad police have only registered a case of abetment to suicide against the doctor couple who complained to Pooja to the police
 aaropee doctor ne kaha he ki agar unke saath koi blakemeling karata he or wo police ke paas jate hai, to kya use khudakushi karne kaa aaropee bana diya jayega, wo bhi tab jab report darj karwaane ke baad unki puja se kabhi koi baat hi nahin hui
 The investigation will be done afresh
after all this is revealed and audio clips of Pooja, Amit and India are revealed, the Faridabad Police is preparing to explore all the aspects in the case afresh
 lekin abhi bhi is maamle main police kii jaanch ek tarfaa or aadhi-adhuri hi kahi jaaegi kyonki us raat itnaa sab kuch hone ke baavjood police ne maukey par puja ke saath maujuud bharat or amarine kii medical jaanch nahin karwaai thi

 khaastaur par sardiyon main log anda khaanaa isliye pasand karte hai kyonki ye paushtik tatwon se bharpoor hote hai or vitamin di kii maatra inamen acchhee hoti he
 But do you know how much vitamin d is found in eggs? agar yah jaan jaaenge to aapako hairaani hogi or isi ke saath aap yah bhi check karne lagenge ki yah anda kisi murgi ne diya he!darasal, jo murgiyaan dhoop main zyada rahati hai unke andey zyada nutrients vaale hote hai or inamen vitamin di kii maatra bhi duusare andon kii tulana main adhik hoti he

 jo murgiyaan dinabhar pinjaron main band rahati hai, unke die andon main vitamin di kii maatra kam hoti he
 So, it is recommended to eat raj egg
 
 
 argenic farm kii murgiyaan zyaadaatar khule main rahati hai
 Therefore, research has said that the level of 25 hydroxy D3 in eggs coming from organic form is high which is better for human health
 shodh ye bhi bataata he ki 'free-range'andonmen 2 microgram tak vitamin di hota he
 2 in organic eggs

 By the way, in addition to eggs, the highest amount of vitamin d is found in fish such as tuna, sonaman and marakel
 vahiin paneer se bhi vitamin di miltaa he

 ' supreme court ne france kii company dasolt se 36 rafel vimaan saude main kisi tarah kii jaanch kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue court kii nigaraanee main sibiai jaanch se manaa kar diya he
 Supreme Court 8
 7 billian dollar kii raksha deal main kisi tarah kii aniyamitata nahin pai he
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi ruled that he did not find any evidence to suggest that the government had entered into an agreement with France to benefit a private company
 supreme court ke is faisle se kendra sarkaar ko raahat mili he or vipaksh kii sibiai jaanch karaane kii maang ko khaarij kar diya gaya he
 Despite this decision, there are many unanswered questions on the deal between the Government of India and France, which neither the Supreme Court decision nor the government is expected to answer
 rafel kaa vanshavaad: tajurba nahin, parivaar dekhakar dasolt ne kiya ambani se kararpartner chunane par sawaal?court ne apane faisle main kaha ki use rafel deal main aisa koi subut nahin mila he jiske aadhaar par kaha ja sake ki kendra sarkaar ne dasolt samjhaute main reliance ko phayda pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 In the court, the central government has said that the French company had the responsibility to choose an offset partner in the agreement with Dassault
 lekin sawaal yah he ki jab bharat or france sarkaar ke bich hui is deal main dasolt ke liye yah jimmedaari chodi gai tab kis aadhaar par bharat sarkaar kii aviation ikai echeel ek aisi company se pichad gai jisane aviation kshetra main kadam qaraar ke baad rakhaa
 Who is misleading Rafael? Who is wrong in Rahul, Macron, Nirmala? Offset clause part of france-india deal? With this deal, an agreement was reached between the governments of India and France that the company got half of the total revenue from the deal to Dassault in a certain way
 Have to invest back in India
 deal ke is paksh ko ofaset cloj kaha gaya
 So, under the deal, Dassault had to make sure that he was 8
 7 billian dollar kii aadhi rakam ko waapas bharat ke raksha kshetra main nivesh kare
 So, when the investment was to be made with this money and the offset clause is part of the indo-french government deal, this investment was made in India for 3 decades in aviation instead of a company whose foundation was laid after the agreement

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has responded to the challenge of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan amidst the tremendous politics over water in Delhi
 kejariwal ne kaha ' main pani ke upar raajnneeti nahin karnaa chahta
 None of them has any concern with the water of Delhi
 keval pani ko lekar gandi raajnneeti kii ja rahi he
 i have the same request through you guys, if dirty water is coming somewhere, then tell us, we will fix it
 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko chunauti dete hue kaha tha 'yadi dilli kaa pani shuddh he to arvind kejariwal ji ye ghoshnaa karen ki unke sabhi karyaalayon se RO hataa liya jayega, sabhi sarkari baithkon main nal kaa pani pilaayaa jayega or dilli sarkaar pani ke maanak ko mendetary karne kii anushansa kare
 'apart from this, there is a deadlock between the central government and the Delhi government over getting Delhi water tested
 taaja team main centre sarkaar kii taraf se bhartiya maanak beuro ke mahanideshak or up mahanideshak ke naam kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kii taraf se namit kiye gaye hai jabaki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii taraf se dilli jal board ke upaadhyaksh dinesh mohaniya or dilli jal board ke sadsy chal ab kumaar kaa naam diya gaya he
 But Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan is objecting to the name of Dinesh Mohania, the vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board
 buudhvaar ko hi vah mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko kah chuke hai ki dinesh mohaniya 1 vidhayak hai or is team main koi rajaneta nahin hona chahie
 On Thursday, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had said, 'mr
 Arvind Kejriwal has nominated two people, including the vice chairman of the Jal Board, on his behalf in the joint team, in which the vice president is a political figure
 maine saafe kaha he ki isamen DJB ke CEO yaa samakaksh adhikari ko namit karen'lekin dilli sarkaar philhal paswan kii maang maanane ko taiyaar nahin
 When Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was asked if Ram Vilas Paswan was objecting to the name of Dinesh Mohania, vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board, in such a situation whether Dinesh Mohania's name would be removed from the shared team, Kejriwal said, 'I don't want to get into this politics
 meraa makasad dilli ke logon ko acha pani pilaanaa he
 If there is bad water, tell me, i will get it corrected
 kaaphi samay se yah khabar aa rahi thi ki fawaad khan, salmaan khan kii agali film kaa hissaa honge
 The film will be made under the production house of Salman Khan
 is film kaa nirdesan nitin kakkad karenge
 Shooting of the film will begin from next year
 lekin ab yah khabar aa rahi he ki fawaad is film kaa hissaa nahin honge
 Nitin said in an interview that he has not signed for Fawad Khan
 vah is baat se inkaar nahin karte ki unki film main fawaad ko lene kii khabaren ai hai, aisi khabaren unhone bhi padhi hai lekin unhone fawaad ko sin nahin kiya he
 Nitin said, 'perhaps someone would have been very happy to have spread such news
 ham kisi pakistaniadakaarake saath koi film nahin bana rahe hai'
 Whereas last year, Nitin told a well-known newspaper that he could start shooting for the film next year with Fawad
 unhen is film ke liye sin kar liya gaya he
 Right now we are busy in selecting the actress for the film
 'ab nitin apane is bayaan se palat gaye hai
 When Nitin was asked whether this decision was taken on the appeal of MNS to ban Pakistani actors, he said that no artist is from any religion or country

 The Congress did not comment on the cbi's argument against senior Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in the anti-sikh riot language and said the matter was under consideration
 party ne kaha ki 1984 main jo hua vah kaaphi dukhadaayak tha
 Party spokesman Manish Tiwari said, 'since the matter is in the CBI court, it is not appropriate to comment
 ’1984 ke sikh dangon kii sunwaayee kar rahi dilli kii ek adaalat ko sibiai ne somvaar ko bataaya ki dangon ke dauraan logon ko bhaybheet karne main sajjan kumaar or police ke bich sathganth thi
 However, Tiwari said, 'what happened in 1984 is very unfortunate and regrettable
 isliye congress netritv main pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh ne do baar is par afsos jataayaa
 When asked why the Congress was commenting on the riot issues despite the case being in court in bjp-ruled Gujarat, the Congress spokesperson said that the party talked about the systemic failure of the Gujarat government in the case
 1984 ke narsanhaar ke dauraan dilli kaint ilaake main chah logon kii hatya maamle main sajjan kumaar or paanch anya vyakti adalati prakriya kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 When Harish Rawat could not become the Chief Minister despite the Congress victory in Uttarakhand Assembly elections, a spicy development occurred for the news channels, but those who knew the party's spirit were not surprised by this
 balki unki pehali jigyaasa yahi thi ki apane haq ke liye aawaaj uthaane vaale ravat ab bhi sansadeey kaary rajya mantri kaise bane hue hai? kyonki congress main naakaam hona utana bada gunaah nahin he, jitna bada gunaah janata par pakad rakhane vaala netaa hona or apni pahchaan bananaa he
 That is why the threat to Rawat is not yet averted and the Congress is very clever in this matter that any compromise be reached at the time of the dispute and the rebel be put on the spot later

 Soon after the death of Rajasekhara Reddy, when jana-jowar was with Jagan, the Congress perceived him to some extent and stopped him from forming a new party

 But now there is no such fragrance far and wide
 udhar vijay bahuguna dhire-dhire hi sahi, apni sthiti majboot karte ja rahe hai
 He slowly increased his rival Harak Singh Rawat's stature as a minister and immediately filed his nomination from the Sitarganj assembly seat
 halaat se nibatane ke liye harish ravat ne bhi maheen kootneeti kaa rasta chunaa he
 First, he got half the ministers in Bahuguna cabinet from his camp, then his supporters Govind Singh Kunjwal managed to get the Speaker of the Assembly and Mahendra Singh Mahra sent to Rajya Sabha
 vahiin rajya yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh kaa pad bhi ravat samarrthak mayukh mahar ko mila he
 Despite all this Rawat does not want to let loose the balance of power
 yahi vajah he ki mahar ne upaadhyaksh banane ke baavjood ab tak padbhaar grahan nahin kiya he
 His argument is, "I don't want to get a chair only
" jab tak sarkaar yah saaf nahin karti ki meri banaai or manjuur kii gai yojanaon par amal kiya jayega tab tak main kaam nahin sanbhaaluungaa
 "rawat's supporter, Congress MLA from Dharchula, Harish Dhami, reached the House wearing a black band
 ravat samarthak vidhayak lalit farsavan yah sawaal poochhate nahin thak rahe ki bahuguna mantrimandal main varisht vidhayakon kii puch kyon nahin hui
 Rawat knows that the matter will not come under control only by the commotion of supporters
 isiilie apni takat dikhaane ke liye ve july kii shuruyaat main 'gadhera bachaao-gaanv bachaao' andolan shuru kar rahe hai
 The donkey is called a small stream
 ravat kaa kahana he, ''badrinaath or kedranathji kaa aashirwad lekar andolan shuru hoga
 In the movement, i will make people aware of the environment
 iske liye agal-alag jagah jansabhaayen hongi
 "despite such turmoil, State Congress President Yashpal Arya believes that there is no factionalism in the state Congress
 bahuguna ke kareebi or narendranagar ke vidhayak subodh uniyaal ek duusare pahalu kii ore dhyaan khinchate hai
 Uniyal says that there was a gap in ticket distribution at many places

 The Congress had to face 8 of the 11 seats in this Lok Sabha constituency
 inamen se zyaadaatar siton par tikat bantwaaraa ravat kii marji ke mutabik hua tha
 Rawat is also alleged to have duped the Congress' Lutiya by handing out tickets to the weaker candidates in the face of favorites
 uniyaal ne kaha, ''ravat varisht netaa hai or sabaki apni-apni mahatvakankshaayen hoti hai
 "but it does not seem that Rawat's ambition to become the Chief Minister as a Congressman will be fulfilled
" puure ghatnakram ko 'muskaraahat ke saath hridyangam' karne vaale ravat kab tak muskaan main apni tis chhupate rahenge or congress kab tak unki gatividhiyon ko nazarandaaj karegi, yah ravat ke siyaasi bhav par nirbhar karegaa
 By the way, both Rawat and his party know the style of the Congress and its current planets better

 Paswan said that according to the information they have received, in the said encounter, policemen were sent to fight without weapons and many of them were not even properly trained
 unhone kaha ki isse aisa prathit hota he ki ve muqabla karne nahin balki kuch chote aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar karne vahaan gaye hue the
 LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan blamed the state government for the encounter and the death of the policemen killed after that, saying that the Chief Minister of the state should explain what steps were taken for his release after the four policemen were taken hostage

 When asked by the Chief Minister of Bihar to call an all-party meeting to solve this problem, Paswan sought to know how many times Nitish called an all-party meeting to solve the Naxal problem and when the water has passed over the head, now it Talking of an all party meeting
 paswan ne kaha ki centre or rajya sarkaar ek saath milakar kyon nahin naksali samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye aage aate hai
 On the other hand, Bihar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Ajit Pratap Singh called the Chief Minister's decision to call an all-party meeting to discuss this current situation as a late step and said that the government should take the opposition in confidence in this matter Was
 singh ne kaha ki unki party kaa maananaa he ki bihar main naksali hinsa se nipatane main rajya sarkaar puri tarah se vifal sabit ho chuki he or iskaa mukhya kaaran naksaliyon ke prati sarkaar kaa naram rukh or kendra kii pahal ke prati udaseenta he
 Bihar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Ajit Pratap Singh said that his party believes that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has repeatedly exposed his soft attitude towards Naxalites by calling them a part of society
 unhone kaha ki naksali bhi samaaj ke hi ek ang he isse koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa he lekin yah bhi satya he ki yah samooh hatyaron kaa ek samooh he or iske saath bhi kanoon ke tahat hi nipta janaa chaiye
 Singh said that Congress believes that during the last two decades, both RJD or JDU have been resorting to Naxalites to win the elections and that is why no concrete action has ever been taken against the militant organizations and the killers This group of the government flourished under government protection
 unhone kaha ki lakhisarai main ghatit gat 29 agast kii ghatana ke baad bhi rajya sarkaar ne koi thos pahal nahin kii balki keval bayaanbaji karti rahi he or isi dauraan bandhak banaaye gaye ek pulicekarmi kii hatya bhi naksaliyon ne kar di
 Singh said that what can be more proof of the apathy of the Bihar government that a policeman injured in Naxal violence has not been fired from his body even after five days and he is in Patna Medical College Hospital for life and death
 Swinging between unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh evam kendriya grih mantri ne naksali hinsa ko desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye ek bada khatra maanate huye prabhavit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii do baar dilli main baithak aahut kii lekin donon baar bihar ke mukhyamantri is baithak main shaamil nahin huye or na to naksaliyon ke khilaaf sanchalit vishesh abhiyaan ke prati gambhirtha hi dikhaai
 Bihar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Ajit Pratap Singh said that his party pays tribute to the policemen who were martyred in the Naxalite violence and expresses condolences to the bereaved family
 unhone kaha ki unki party rajya sarkaar se naksali hinsa main maare gayi pulicekarmiyon ke ashrith parivaar ko 25-25 lakh rupee muaavja dene tathaa parivaar ke ek sadsy ko sarkari naukari or awaas uplabdh karaane kii maang karti he
 Meanwhile, CPI-ML National General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, while expressing the need for a political solution to the matter, said that if the Chief Minister of Bihar wants to send a message that the government is ready for talks, i think Nitish ji should make RJD supremo Lalu Prasad as mediator Negotiations should be offered

 Union Minister and BJP leader Nitin Gadkari said on Monday that reservation is necessary for the development of people belonging to socially and economically backward communities, but their overall development cannot be ensured only by the quota system
 unhone shiksha, saamaajik evam aarthik kadamon se samudaay ke vikaas par jor diya
 Gadkari spoke of leadership rising above caste considerations and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for never taking recourse to his caste
 ' kendriya mantri ne mahatma phule shikshan santhaan dwaara yojit 'akhil bhartiya mali samaaj mahaudhiveshan' main aae logon ko sambodhit kiya

 Later, Gadkari addressed the people present there
 unhone kaha ki har samudaay se aam taur par aisi maangen saamne aati hai or is tarah ke daavon se pare hatakar sochna chahie
 The BJP leader said that he has personally felt that having more and more ministers from the community does not mean that people of the said social group will make more progress

 'but, i asked him if Indira Gandhi had got reservation
 kai saal tak unhone desh par shashan kiya or lokapriy baniin
 Gadkari said, "in the same way what reservation was given to Vasundhara Raje and Sushma Swaraj (BJP leader)?" The Union Minister stressed on promoting better and visionary leadership from a community so that the people of that community can move forward on the path of success
 unhone kaha, 'aarakshan diya janaa chahie lekin un logon ko jo shoshit-peedit, dalit, samaaj main saamaajik evam aarthik rup se pichde hai
 'he said,' But if anyone thinks that only reservation will lead to the overall development of a community, it is not true
 jis samudaay ko atyadhik aarakshan miltaa he
 This development is not correct even thinking
 ' gadakari ne kaha, 'raajnneeti main jo acha kaam karata he, use vot ke liye poochna nahin padataa he kyonki use vot swaabhaavik rup se milte hai
 'gadkari said,' Prime Minister Modi never talked about his caste

 Finally, the entire investigation against the country's notorious arms dealer has been stuck on an e-mail ID
 uske khilaaf digital saboot jutaney main jaanch agenciyon ko pasinaa aa gaya he
 The investigation against the notorious arms dealer Abhishek Verma began with parties being held in farmhouses in South Delhi and touching the limits of Ayyashi
 adhikariyon ne jab inamen mili suraagon kaa peechha kiya, to ve blackmel ke liye chhanti gai netaaon kii sharmnaak tasveeron, tex choron kii videshi gupt khaaton or duniya bhar main banaai gai farji companiyon se hote hue ehtiyaat se chhipaakar rakhe gaye dastavejon ke ek jakhire tak pahunche
 Some of the most secure secrets of the armed forces were recorded in it
 jaanch agenciyon nobhishek verma ke khilaaf takreeban aadha darjan maamalonke bikhare hue taar kadi mehnat se ek-duusare se jode
 Verma is the same person who miraculously recovered from the stain of the 2006 Naval War Room leak case as the 'manager' of the South Block
 lekin uske ek sahyogi (escro fund manager) si
 When Edmunds Allen introduced new evidence in New York in 2012, it again caught up
 uske khilaaf chal rahe maamalon kii jaanch antim sire par pahunchane hi vaali thi ki jaanch agenciyaan ek digital avrodh se takaraakar ladkadaati dikhaai de rahi hai
 Most of the evidence found by the CBI against the foundations of evidence rests on one foundation
 vah buniyaad yah he ki usne alan ko kai dastavej niyamit rup se i-mail se bheje the, jinamein bank khaaton, vyavsaayik saudon or gopneey dastavejon ke byore darj the
 These were the documents Allen submitted in 2012 as evidence
 isi ke baad jaanch kaa silsilaa shuru hua tha
 But now the CBI has claimed that it cannot prove that one of these e-mail id evaherzigova @ gmail
 com kaa istemaal sirf or sirf verma hi karata tha
 The report presented in the court says, "during the investigation, it could not be proved that this email id was used solely by Verma
 ' sibiai ne jis maamle main closer report daakhil kii he usamen verma par aarope he ki usne 2009 ke nausena waar room li maamle main use clin chit dene vaali sibiai afasar kii ek kathith jaali chitthee taiyaar kii
 However, the CBI report has not yet been approved by the court
 isamen jaanch ko band karne kii vajahen ginai gai hai
 One of these reasons is that there is no certified beneficiary of the fake letter
 ek or ahm baat yah kahi gai he ki i-mail idi kaa verma ke saath sidhaa rishta sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 If the court approves this report, it can go against the cbi's stand against Verma in the most sensitive cases under the Government Secrecy Act (OSA), because these cases have been sustained on the basis that Verma -mail ID sent sensitive documents abroad
 digital sabutasibiai or pravartan nideshaalay ke haathon main verma ke khilaaf jo saboot hai unamem se zyaadaatar digital hai
 This evidence was given by Allen two years ago after a fight with this arms dealer
 agar jaanch agenciyaan yah sabit nahin kar paati hai ki verma ne ye dastavej alan ko i-mail se bheje the, to ye maamle munh ke bal gir sakate hai
 Chasing the IP address of the e-mail ID, the investigating agencies reached Verma's farmhouse, where he is registered as the sole tenant
 iske baavjood sibiai ne closer report main kaha he ki vah nirnaayak taur par yah sabit nahin kar sakati ki verma ne hi dastavej bhejne ke liye is i-mail idi kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Regarding this, Allen told India Today, 'if the court approves this closure report in the case of alleged forgery of the CBI letter, then legally all the cases of CBI and ED are running against it in many other courts of India
 But the path of rejection will be cleared

 After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, the statement made by Navjot Singh Sidhu was fiercely debated
 soshal media par siddhu ko bycott karne kaa hashtag trend karne laga

 According to the report, Sunil will arrive to promote his film 'bharat'

 pichley kai dinon se hisar ke barwaala main ashram ke baahar deraa jamaaye rampal samarthakon kii diwaar ab tuutane lagi he
 After the order of the administration, a large number of supporters of the siege have started going back home and along with this, the reality of many Rampal is also coming to the fore
 ashram se laut rahe samarthakon ko kahana he ki unhen jabaran ashram ke andar roak kar rakhaa gaya tha or media se baat karne tak kii manaahi thi
 Some supporters are also saying that for the last four days nothing was given for food and drink
 darasal court ke aadesh par rampal ko giraftaar karne pahunchi police ke bich yahi samarthak diwaar banakar khadey the, jisaki vajah se puraa prashasnic amala rampal ko giraftaar karne kii koshish karata rahaa, lekin safalataa uske haath nahin lagi
 Meanwhile, the court issued a new non-bailable warrant against Rampal and ordered him to be produced in the court on the 21st
 saath hi court ne prashasan ko yah aadesh diya he ki giraftaar kii koshishon main ho rahe kharche kii bharpai rampal se karwaai jaae
 On one hand, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung is issuing a statement and asserting his authority over the ACB, saying that he has not yet come up with a proposal to appoint Bihar police officers in Delhi Anti Corruption Branch and If it comes, we will check it well and decide
 to duusari taraf dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya kaa kahana he kii dilli sarkaar or asibi ko apane yahaan adhikari niyukt karne kaa puraa adhikaar he
 This matter is going on in the court as well, yet why are the circumstances such that LG and Delhi government have come face to face again? While the hearing was held in the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court on Friday itself
 asal main na to shuukravaar 29 may ko sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne dilli asibi ke adhikaar par koi tipanni kii yaa phir dilli hoicourt ke 25 may ke aadesh par koi roak lagaai, jisame asibi ko dilli main karpshan maamalon main karrwai kaa purna adhikaar bataaya gaya tha
 And when the hearing was held in the Delhi High Court also, the court had given only such order in the appointment case that the two recent transfer orders should be sent to the Delhi Government LG as a proposal, which they will discuss
 yani kyonki court ne dilli sarkaar yaa asibi par kahin kisi tarah kii karrwai par na to koi roak lagaayee na koi niyukti ko lekar aadesh diya (do adeshon ke atirikt) isliye dilli sarkaar maanati he ki wo jaisaa kar rahi he vahi sanvaidhanik he, sahi he
 The comments jabaki alji yah maan rahe hai ki notification par court ne koi roak nahin lagaai or na hi ye radd hua he isliye dilli sarkaar jo kar rahi he vah galat he or vah jo kah rahe hai vahi sahi or sanvaidhanik he
 See, both were interpreting the law and its provisions till now, and were confronting it, but now both the court order and the hearing are being interpreted according to their own, so that the matter is still stuck where Was earlier

 yah maamla court main bhi chal rahaa he phir bhi halaat aise kyon bane hue hai ki alji or dilli sarkaar phir se aamane-saamne aa gaye hai? jabaki shuukravaar ko hi supreme court or dilli hoicourt main is par sunwaayee hui thi
 In fact, neither did the Supreme Court make any comment on the Delhi acb's authority during the hearing on Friday 29 May, or put a moratorium on the Delhi High Court's order of 25 May, in which the ACB was given full authority to take action in corruption cases in Delhi
 Was
 or dilli hai court main bhi jab sunwaayee hui to court ne niyukti maamle main keval itnaa aadesh diya tha ki haal ke tabadale ke do aadesh prastaav ke taur par dilli sarkaar alji ko bheje, jis par vah charchaa karenge
 That is, because the court neither banned any action on Delhi government or ACB nor ordered any appointment (except for two orders), so the Delhi government believes that what it is doing is constitutional, right
 
 tippaniyan While LG is assuming that the court has not put any restriction on the notification and it has not been canceled, therefore what the Delhi government is doing is wrong and what they are saying is right and constitutional
 dekh lijiye kanoon or uske praavdhaanon kii vyakhya abhi tak donon apane hisaab se kar rahe the or bhide hue the, lekin ab court ke aadesh or sunwaayee kii vyakhya bhi donon apane hisaab se kar rahe hai, jisase maamla aaj bhi vahiin par fansaa hua he jahaan pehle tha

 It is now very easy to get doctors treated at AIIMS, India's most prestigious medical institute
 is premier santhaan main har roj ausatan 8,000 marij aate hai or isliye yahaan hameshaa maaramaari rahati he
 It becomes very difficult to meet the doctors, but now it has become easier to see the doctors
 aspataal ne ek nai vyavastha kii he jiske tahat ab phone se doctoron se samay liya ja sakegaa
 This news has been given by an English newspaper
 uske mutabik yah vyavastha 15 agast se shuru ho chuki he
 The newspaper quoted Dr
 MC Mishra, director of AIIMS, as saying that now every day 1500 calls are coming from doctors to take time
 phone karne vaale har marij ko ek number diya jaataa he jise UHID number kaha jaataa he
 They get time there only with this number
 marijon ko iske liye santhaan ke phone number 09266092660 par phone karnaa hota he
 This call is transferred to a call center which books the date and time for the particular department
 lekin isamen shart yahi he ki us din vahaan uplabdhta ho
 It can be spoken in English and Hindi
 iske baad ek list sambandhit doctor ko di jaati he or yah pradarshit bhi kar di jaati he
 The institute is also trying to make lab reports available online
 isse vahaan bheed ghategi or marijon ko bhi aaraam milegaa
 If we talk about thrills, then the assembly elections in Delhi have also left T20 cricket behind
 vot padane se teen hafte pehle hi dilli main har ghante chunavi bisaat jis teji se badal rahi he, usase dilli ke votaron ke alaava baaki desh ke tamashbinon ko bhi bada majaa aa rahaa he
 When the talk of elections was starting, till such time there was such an atmosphere that BJP riding on Modi wave has an edge and Kejriwal's challenge is to stop the wave
 lekin jald hi phija badali, bijepi or aap donon kii hi ranneetiyon se aisa laga jaise kejariwal kii party kaa palada baari he or mashkkat karne kii baari bijepi kii he
 After that, when Kejriwal made public the horoscope of state BJP president Satish Upadhyay, it seemed that AAP had won
 kuch had tak hua bhi aisa hi
 Upadhyay, who seemed to be at the forefront till yesterday, suddenly became marginalized and the condition was that he did not even get an assembly ticket
 unhone kejariwal par manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karne kii baat kahi, lekin unke daawey ko graahak nahin mili
 Upadhyay, who looked like a new face of BJP at the beginning of the election, is now a burden on the party
 is hamale kaa jawaab koi bhi badi or khaskar centre or desh ke adhikansh rajyon main jabardast jeet hasil kar rahi party apane andaaj main detii
 But the BJP showed great agility
 party agle hi din purv ipies afasar kiran bedi ko saamne laai
 The party does not hesitate to say what people will say
 Because the question was to arise that after the last Lok Sabha elections, why did the BJP, which has been contesting all the assembly elections without a face in Delhi, need a face in Delhi? He is insufficient in Delhi
 duusari tarah kaa sawaal yah he ki kya party ko dilli main haar kaa dar sata rahaa he? aise main vah bijepi kii haar ko modi kii haar ke vajaay kiran bedi yaa sthaneey netritv kii haar bataanaa chaahati he
 Had there been any other party than the party led by Amit Shah, he would have shown similar traditional thinking after reaching the highest position of power, but Amit Shah is very agile
 isiilie 19 janvari raat 11 baje jab unhone press conference kar kiran bedi ko bijepi kaa mukhyamantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kiya to patrakaron ke isi tarah ke sawaalon par kaha, ‘‘party aapke sawaalon se nahin chalegi
 We know the good and bad of the party
 ’’jamini sachaai ko dekhakar ranneeti main buniyadi badlaav karne kaa yah samathrya congress tab kabhi nahin dikhaa saki, jab vah satta ke sheersh par thi
 Due to not being able to understand the pulse of time, his satraps kept on shattering and the old leaders of the Congress fed the flowers of the Third Front parties in the country
 bijepi ne congress ke itihaas se vah sabak bahut jaldi le liya jo apane sabase bure samay main bhi congress nahin le paa rahi he
 The second thing the BJP did was to understand that despite all the challenges of AAP, Kiran Bedi was given ticket from Mahfuz seat like Krishna Nagar
 iske saath hi unke nai dilli se kejariwal ke khilaaf ladgaye kii atakalein khatm ho gayi
 Whereas in the last assembly election, Kejriwal had made a strategy against Sheila Dixit and then in the Lok Sabha election against Benaras against Narendra Modi, in which Raja directly collided with Raja
 is ranneeti main sansani or khabar kaa tatv to he lekin paramparaayen hameshaa iske khilaaf rahi hai
 The tradition is to beat the pawn with the wazir
 bijepi isi kaa anusaran kar rahi he
 If the first move of the electoral board goes in favor of Kejriwal, then the second bet is BJP
 congress ke ajay maakan bich-bich main twit karke majaa le rahe hai, lekin party ko vajandaar tareeke se pesh nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Anyway, till the Congress does not hold a big rally in Delhi by gathering a crowd of 2 lakhs, its claw lines are not going to change
 aise main ab kejariwal phir se nayaa pasa phenk rahe hai
 He has challenged Bedi for a debate, which led to Bedi being cut off very cleanly
 kejariwal jald hi nai chaal lekar aate hi honge
 It remains to be seen whether the BJP has already maintained its security cycle or will see it immediately
 chunavi rangamanch par abhi kai chaunkaane vaale drishy aane vaale hai, itnaa tay jaaniye
 Accusing the ministers of Uttar Pradesh government directly of corruption, Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi said that the central government had sent money for the development of poor farmers of Bundelkhand and not to buy tractors of relatives of state minister Nasimuddin Siddiqui
 unhone kaha ki paisa sahi jagah kharch nahin hua
 Rahul said that in the same way the central government had sent money for health services and not for the food of ministers and officials
 iske pher main funskar ek mantri sibiai jaanch main funs gayi hai or apane ko bachaane ke liye dilli tak ke chakkar kaat rahe hai
 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi was addressing a very backward class rally organized by the Congress at Mati Headquarters
 raily main umadi baari bheed ko dekhakar utsahit rahul gandhi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar vibhinn janakalyankari yojanaon ke liye uttar pradesh sarkaar ko paisa bhejti he na ki pradesh ke mantriyon or adhikariyon ke khaane ke liye
 He said, 'we feel very sad when the poor people of the state do not get the benefit of welfare schemes
 ye pradesh ke har varg kaa nuksaan he
 Rahul said that the farmers of Bundelkhand had reached out to them about their poverty and plight, then they had asked the Prime Minister to arrange a special package for Bundelkhand
 lekin ab unhen maaloom hua he ki bundelkhand ke vikaas kaa paisa pradesh ke lokanirmaan mantri nasimuddin siddki ne aam kisaanon or garibon ko dene ke bajaay apane rishtedaaron ko tractor dilaane main kiya he
 Rahul said that in the same way, the central government gave an amount of crores of rupees to the Uttar Pradesh government for the health schemes of the state
 us dhanrashi ko bhi rajya ke mantri or adhikari milakar baantkar kha gayi jiskaa khamiyaja ab pradesh ke purv mantri ko bhugatna pad rahaa he or vah sibiai ke chakkar main funskar apane ko bachaane ke liye dilli ke chakkar kaat rahe hai
 Rahul's reference was to former minister Baburam Kushwaha but he did not name him
 rahul ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main kalyankari yojanaon main paisa na kharch hone ke kaaran yahaan ke logon ko rojgaar ke liye apane parivaar ko chhodkar dilli, mumbai jaise shaharon kii taraf bhaagna padataa he
 Rahul asked that the laborers who have built the metro rail in Delhi, do they have the ability to climb in that metro? He said that if the means of employment were available in his state, then the people of the state would not have to leave their families and children for employment in other states
 rahul ne kaha ki pichley 22 varshon main pradesh main vikaas ke naam par sirf jati or dharm kii raajnneeti hui he
 BJP looted the state in the name of religion and God, Samajwadi Party looted in the name of caste and Bahujan Samajwadi Party's elephant only eats money
 rahul ne pradesh kii sthiti taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki pichley 22 varshon main aapane alag-alag sarkaron ko chunaa or uskaa nateeja dekh liya ki aap lagaataar pichhadate hi ja rahe hai
 Now we promise you that for five years Congress should give opportunity to the government and after that you see the difference
 aapako rojgaar maangane ke liye duusare pradeshon main nahin janaa padegaa balki duusare pradesh ke log yahaan uttar pradesh rojgaar maangane aayenge
 He requested the public to win the Congress with heavy votes
 jaipur main brahman sanghathanon ne ravivaar koparshuram shobhaayatranikaali
 During this, people created a ruckus and a scuffle, accusing a police station in-charge of making objectionable remarks and snatching of the furs
 virodh main brahman samaaj ke logon ne kareeb 2 ghante tak thane kaa gheraav kiya
 Later, when the station in-charge had to apologize with folded hands, the matter went quiet
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik, brahman sanghathanon ne jaipur ke khania hanuman mandir se 52 feet hanuman mandir tak shobhaayatra nikaali
 The visit was already permitted by the police administration
 tabhi raily ke puraani chungi ke paas pahunchate hi kuch log hangaamaa karne lage
 He alleged that Indraj Marodia, in-charge of kho-nagorian police station, made objectionable remarks to Lord Parashurama
 yah sunate hi log bhadak gaye or narebaaji karne lage
 During this time, the police in-charge and other police personnel were manhandled along with some people
 maamla badhata dekh raily main shaamil kuch log thana prabharee ko pakadakar dur le gaye
 Later the station in-charge Indraj Marodia apologized with folded hands in front of senior officers and then the matter was resolved
 saath hi likhit samjhauta hua ki donon paksh kisi tarah kii karrwai nahin karenge
 Please tell that after this case, the station in-charge Indraj Marodia has gone on leave
 haalanki, ab tak is bare main jaipur police ne kisi tarah kaa spashtikaran nahin diya he
 Indraj apologized with folded hands, Indraj folded his hands in front of the people and said - My feeling is not wrong
 main kisi ko thes nahin pahunchaana chahta
 If anyone feels that i have said something wrong about a particular religion or community, then i apologize with folded hands
 maine hathiyaar ke liye manaa kiya ki kyonki hathiyaar se kisi ko chot lag jaati to sari javaabadari meri hoti
 Still, if someone is hurt, i apologize with folded hands and feet
 'kumkum bhagya' ke 3 janvari ke episod kii shuruyaat hui aalia, nikhil or tanu kii baton se
 Alia and Nikhil tell Tanu about their entire plan how they have trapped Pragya and Purab in their trap so that both of them fall from Abhi's eyes
 is bich daadi, daasi or pragna aalia or tanu kii harkaton ke bare main baaten karti hai ki is baar to donon ne had hi paar kar di
 At the same time, Pragya thinks that why does Purba say in front of Abhi that he loves her
 iske baad purab kamare main aata he or pragna usase puuchhati he ki usne aisa kyon kiya? pragna usase kahati he ki uski is harakat se uske or abhi ke bich kii dooriyaan or zyada bad jaaengi
 At the same time, grandmother is very angry with him
 tippaniyan Purab tells Pragya that he considers her like his elder sister and all he did is to join Abhi and Pragya
 usne kaha ki jab aalia or tanu un par iljaam laga rahi thim tab vah samaj gaya tha ki ve un donon ke khilaaf kuch plan kar rahi hai, isliye usne kuch nahin kaha
 Purab said that Alia and Tanu feel that they have both won but their happiness will not last long
 purab kahata he ki uske yah kehane se ki vah pragna se pyaar karata he abhi ko jalan hogi or vah apane dil kii sari baaten kah degaa
 Meanwhile, Aaliya gets worried about why Purba has said that he loves Pragya

 The open criticism in the Congress has started after a bitter defeat in the general election
 purv kendriya mantri milind devda ne buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi ke salaahkaaron ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Milind Deora said that the people who advised Rahul Gandhi were not well
 unhen jamini hakeekat kaa gyaan nahin hai, na hi chunaavon kaa anubhav he
 But those who seek advice also have to take responsibility
 vahiin congress netaa satyavrath chaturvedi ne bhi milind devda kii baat ko sahi bataakar aalochana kii aawaaj ko or buland kar diya he
 However, criticism of Deora's statement within the Congress has also started
 rajyasabha saansad hossain dalwai ne party main milind devda ke yogadan par hi sawaal uthaa die hai
 Deora, who lost the election from Mumbai South parliamentary seat, told the English newspaper 'the Indian Express' that there are' many factors' behind the Congress' defeat and only Rahul Gandhi's leadership cannot be blamed for this
 unhone kaha, 'yah ek shaks kii chhavi ke bare main nahin, balki uske aas-paas ke logon ke bare main tha
 'my comments are out of emotions of deep loyalty to the party, pain of our performance & a sincere desire to see us bounce back
 Nothing more— Milind Deora (@milinddeora)may 22, 2014field party work & electoral battles are key to comprehend ground realities
 This should form the basis for leadership posts in Congress— Milind Deora (@milinddeora) May 22, 2014 'the list of not-heard party cadre' Deora's words were, 'the question is whether the advisors were aware of the ground reality
 party main aisi khusfusaahat thi ki jo log faisle le rahe the unhen chunaavon kaa koi anubhav nahin tha
 Nor did he have stature, stand, respect and credibility in the party
 ve pramukh vibhaagon ke prabharee the or ahm padon par asin the
 These group of people did not listen to the party cadre and mps
 unhone alag-alag vichaaron ko charchaa main aane se roka or koi logon ko chup kara diya
 Many of us knew that the party had become indifferent
 agar system thodaa khulaa or samaveshi hota or sabake vichaaron ko suna jaataa to sudhaar ke upaay kiye ja sakate the
 In the last Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Milind Deora said that many people of the party felt that they were not being heard
 unhen lagane laga tha ki unki raay myne hi nahin rakhti
 Deora did not say wrong: Satyavrat Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi has also told Milind Deora's point
 unhone kaha, 'rahul ke salaahkaaron ke paas anubhav nahin he
 There was a lack of coordination between the party and the government
 rahul se galati hui, galati ham sabase hui
 It is necessary to fix it
 milind devda ne thik hi kaha he lekin unhone jo bhi kuch kaha wo unhen party forum main kahana chahie tha
 "what has Milind done for the party", Rajya Sabha MP Hussain Dalwai from Maharashtra has lashed out at the statement of Milind Deora
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa ki unhone yah sab kyon kaha
 He himself was an adviser to Rahul
 vah rahul ke kareebi hai
 i don't think the reason for the defeat is the wrong salute
 milind devda kaa party ke liye koi yogadan nahin he
 Despite this, he was given a ticket and made a minister, only because of his father (murali Deora)
 ''salaah lene waalon ko bhi leni hoti he jimmedaari'rahul gandhi ko bhi lapete main lete hue milind devda ne kaha, 'sirf salaahkaaron kii baat nahin he
 People seeking advice also have to bear the responsibility
 ve jo salaah dete hai, ve jo salaah lete hai or ve jo samajhate hai ki ve behatar salaah de sakate the, sabko jimmedaari leni padati he
 Without naming anyone, Milind Deora said that now the only way is to open the party a bit and give space to the voices of protest and debate
 unhone party main aaazaad or khuli charchaa or javabdehi sunishchit karne kii jarurat bataai
 Deora said that it is not right to just curse the election campaign
 party ne kai jagahon par galat disha main kadam badaye hai
 We were going in the wrong direction on all these fronts, the thinking of the party, the coordination between the government, contacts, party and government
 pichley teen saal se chijen kharaab ho rahi thim
 BJP leader LK Advani on Saturday praised Narendra Modi and Shivraj Singh Chauhan in the same tone and said that both the Chief Ministers have given good governance in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh
 adwani ne kaha ki narendra modi ho, shivaraj singh chouhan yaa phir raman singh sabhi ne apane rajyon main sushasan diya he
 He asked people to compare all governments and think who can give you an honest, efficient and people oriented government
 gauratlab he ki narendra modi ke saath adwani ke sambandh achche nahin rahe hai or modi ko party ke chunaav abhiyaan kaa pramukh banaae ke virodh main unhone party ke sabhi padon se apana istipha bhi de diya tha

 The trailer also ends with Sonam Kapoor closing the scene in a glass box
 film ek nae vishay par he, lekin phens kaisaa rispance dete hai ye 1 farvari ko film relies ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 Let me tell you, Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor will be seen together for the first time in Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To Aisa Laga
 film ko style chopra ne diarect kiya he or vidhu vinod chopra ne produs kiya he
 The team of the past film was seen on Kapil Sharma's chat show for promotion
 videsh daura ab vaisaa nahin rahaa ki prasthaan or aagaman kii tasviren agle din ke akhbaaron main chap gayi
 Or while returning, the Prime Minister was interviewed on a plane or at a summit, there were unrecognizable photographs of many leaders printed under countless national flags
 yaad kiijie obama kaa bharat daura
 Before coming to Delhi go to Mumbai, sometimes to see the Taj, sometimes to see Humayun's Tomb with wife Michelle
 kya pradhanmantri narendra modi vaisaa hi kuch kar rahe hai yaa bilkul nayaa kar rahe hai
 Are they really making a big difference in formal visits abroad
 kahin wo pehali baar jate hai to kahin dashakon baad jane vaale pehle pradhanmantri ho jate hai
 The first mention is made on some excuse
 fiji, bhutan, mongolia, nepal, morishas, australia or britain kii sansad ko sambodhit karnaa, salaami se lekar mulaakaat tak kuch aisa hona jo pehali baar hota he yaa bahut dinon baad hota he
 Issues such as permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council and definition of terrorism are permanent and India's relations with each country are said to be stronger than before
 britain ko europea sambandhon kaa pravesh dwaar bataate hai to australia main jaakar pradhanmantri kehete hai ki 28 saal lag gaye kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri ko australia aane main lekin ab chizein badalengi or australia hamaare vijan ke haashiye par nahin balki centre main hoga
 Comparing the speech style of the Prime Minister with his foreign tours at the election meetings of Bihar, there are exactly two different figures
 bahut se log maanate hai ki duniya ke nakshe par bharat ko lekar kuch nayaa ho rahaa he
 The visit of Prime Minister Maudi is changing the image of India
 unki yatra jab bhi aadhakarik charan main hoti he tamaam news channelon par ek hi tarah ke angel se shot chalane lagate hai
 a special kind of discipline is formed
 ek bane banaaye frem main pradhanmantri kaa har kadam pehle se sochaa samajha lagata he
 Foreign policy experts should also include the cameras' eyesight in diplomatic analysis
 kis tarah helicopter se liya gaya british sansad kaa shot ek alag kisse kii rachana karata he
 The top angle shot shows the depth of the Parliament and suddenly the position of the Prime Minister begins to be something else in the mind of the spectator sitting in distant India
 aisa hota he yaa nahin daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa lekin jab camera chackers main pradhanmantri modi or british pradhanmantri camerun ko dekhtaa he tab donon tej hawaaon ke khilaaf badhate chale ja rahe hote hai
 This picture creates a special kind of intimacy, despite this, in the checkers, from the President of Pakistan to the President of China has also gone last month
 mujhe videsh dauron kaa behatar gyaan nahin he isliye nahin bataa saktaa ki chini raashtrapati ke daure ko camaron ne khaas nazar se cover kiya tha yaa nahin
 Just as the President's residence in India is in Shimla and Hyderabad, the rural government residence of the British Prime Minister is checkers
 ye saare drishy aam se aam aadmi ko sakasham karte honge ki wo bhi videsh niti ko samaj saktaa he
 In 1985, when US President Regan caught the umbrella for Rajiv Gandhi, there was a lot of sensation in India
 pradhanmantri modi ke saath aise kisson kii bharmaar he
 Remember when the audio cassette era was used to ask how much of the live recording of the Royal Albert Hall in London
 ghazal or geet ke saath taaliyon kii gadgadaahat kii dhwani atirikt sangeet kii rachana karti thi
 Jagjit Singh, Lata Mangeshkar and Amitabh Bachchan
 baad main bollywood ke star apni event team lekar duniya bhar main kooch karne lage
 Blockbuster and Raw Costar have begun to suit Prime Minister Modi's foreign tours
 landan ke wemble stadium main unke kaarykram ke liye jo paas jari kiye gaye hai us par sho likhaa he
 In the stadium part of his tour, the Prime Minister transforms into a show man
 america kaa medicin scavyar ho yaa australia kaa aalfons arina
 Wembley in London is a very expensive stadium
 itane mahange aayojan ke liye aayojakon kii daad di jaani chahie

 kalakaaron ke kai group hai
 Some artists are also presenting programs on a personal level
 saath hajaar log pradhanmantri kaa besabri se intazaar kar rahe hai
 But the Prime Minister is also facing opposition in this visit
 sitambar maheene main sanyukt raashtra ke mukhyalay ke saamne pradhanmantri modi kii yatra kaa virodh hua tha jo landan tak aate aate mukhar ho gaya he

 nae saal ke aagaaj ke saath hi america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne aatankwaad ke panaahagaah pakistan par karaara hamalaa bolaa he
 At the same time, we have prepared to give a big blow to Pakistan
 vahiin, isse pakistan main khalabali much gai
 Stung by Trump's statement, Pakistan has also spoken of giving a befitting reply
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai ke naam par pakistan ne hameshaa se america samet duniya bhar ko gumraah kaa kiya he, lekin ab uski is chalbaaji ko sabhi samaj chuke hai
 This is the reason that as soon as the new year starts, US President Donald Trump has fiercely lashed Pakistan over terrorism
 trump ne kaha ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai ke naam par pakistan ne sirf america ko ab tak murkh banaaya he
 He said that the United States has given more than $ 33 billion in aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years, but it gave us nothing but lies and deception
 pakistan hamaare netaaon ko murkh samajhataa he
 The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools
 They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help
 No more! - Donald j Trump (@realdonaldtrump)january 1, 2018unhone kaha ki abhi tak america pakistan kii napak chaal ko samaj nahin paa rahaa tha, lekin ab sab saaf ho gaya he
 America has fully understood Pakistan's love of terrorism
 donald trump ne aatankwaad ko lekar americanyon ko saaf sandesh dete hue kaha, ''pakistan ne hamaare netaaon ko ab tak murkh samajha
 In 15 years, Pakistan was given US $ 33 billion, which was kind of useless, because Pakistan has never stopped terrorism
 ''vahiin, is bayaan se tilamilaae pakistan ne america ko jawaab dene kii baat kahi he
 After Trump's statement, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi
 khwaja asif ne twit kiya, ''ham america raashtrapati donald trump ke twit kaa jald jawaab denge
 Inshallah the world will know the reality

 trump ke is rukh ne aane vaale dinon main pakistan kii museebataan bad sakati hai
 Pakistan's support from the US will also stop

 Nestlé says that banning Maggie and ordering Nestle to withdraw from its product market is both wrong
 company ne bombai hoicourt main yachika di he ki vah FSSAI ke aadesh par roak lagaae
 Nestle India says, 'we are withdrawing Maggi products from the market
 adaalat main yachika daayar karne se is prakriya par koi asar nahin padegaa

 FSSAI has also included other brands such as noodles and pasta in the investigation

 His father is in the army and posted in Meerut
 harsha or harshitha apane dada-daadi ke ghar ke peeche khadi ek puraani hundai car main behosh milin, jahaan ve aksar khelti thim
 He was declared dead in a private hospital
 aise sanket mili hai ki ladakiyon ne car kaa darwaja kholane ke liye kaaphi sangharsh bhi kiya gaya tha

 There was a malfunction in the lock of the car and its windows could not be even down
 tippaniyan When the family realized that the girls were missing by 4 pm, they started searching for them
 bacchiyaan is car main behoshee kii haalat mempai gayi
 The father of the girls, Govind Singh, cried and said, 'when my daughters were born, there was great happiness in the family
 donon kaa admician meerut ke kendriya vidhyalay main karaayaa gaya tha
 Everyone described her as very promising, because she was very intelligent, sharp and mischievous'
 unka kahana tha ki 'meri betiyaan is duniya ko ek saath chhod dengi, aisa kabhi sochaa bhi nahin tha'
 Harsha and Harshita were found unconscious in an old Hyundai car parked behind their grandparents' house, where they often played

 There have been indications that the girls had also struggled to open the car door

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke gorakshak or daliton ko lekar haal main aae bayanon ko shivasena ne filmi dialog jaisaa bataaya he
 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday that PM Modi should bring out the list of fake guards
 gorakshak or daliton par diepradhanmantri ke bayaanpar shivasena saansad sanjay raut se khaas baatcheet -sawaal - sanjyaji jo yah bayaan aayaa ki 80 percent gau rakshak farji hai
 The VHP is angry about that statement and should apologize for such a statement by Sadhu Sant and some organizations associated with cow protection? Sanjay Raut - who is the 80 percent fake guardian organization of his organization
 yah farji log koun hai? unki puri list pradhanmantri ko logon ke saamne lani chahie
 This is the first demand
 aaj tak 2-3 saal main yah farji log yah gorakhdhandha kar rahe the
 Why haven't you come up yet? Who are the people behind? If there is a conspiracy to discredit the government, it should also come to the fore
 isliye chaahe farji vyapaaree ho, chaahe gorakshak hon
 Nothing fake will work in this country
 hamen abhi tak lagata tha ki sabhi gorakshakavishv hindu parishadke hai, aresas ke hai
 The people of Bajrang Dal's Hinduist organization
 sadhu-santon ke log hai
 But the Prime Minister says that if there are fake people, then i find this issue very serious and big
 hindu rakshak ke naam par pradhanmantri ko farji lagata he to yah bada mudda he
 Question- After two years, the Prime Minister felt that the question has arisen as to why action was not taken? Sanjay Raut- Why was he born in two years? We had raised this question, how did this thousands of millions of coworkers become born in two years? This should be investigated
 agar yah farji he to ham nahin maanate kii farji honge
 It is a matter of reverence
 usamen kuch asaamaajik tatv ghus gaye honge
 But which is said to be 80%
 us par bakheda ho saktaa he
 Question- The Prime Minister has given a statement not only about the guards but also about the Dalits, shoot me, do not persecute the Dalits
 kaise dekhte hai is bayaan ko?sanjay raut- daliton ke saath agar vah kashmiri panditon kaa bhi naam jod dete kikashmiri panditonko goli mat maaro
 Do not shoot Dalits
 to shivasena ko bahut anand hota
 We have heard these types of dialogues on the film screen
 pradhanmantri kii apni bhaavana he
 It is not good to shoot the Prime Minister's mouth
 ab tak logon ko saleem-javed ke dialog main aisi baaten achche lagati hai
 The Prime Minister is the identity of the country
 raashtra kii asmita hai
 Our courageous Prime Minister should talk about action
 goli maarane se kuch nahin hoga
 The country is saddened by his statement
 ham pradhanmantri ko pasand karte hai
 Want him to rule for 25 years

 Marriage is a pure and loving relationship that not only connects the boy and the girl for ages but also gives each other a loving companion
 kehete hai kisi bhi rishte kii shuruyaat se pehle ek-duusare ko jaananaa or samajhnaa behad jaruri he
 This is the reason that nowadays young people start associating with each other before marriage
 lekin inhen sab ke bich kai baar yuva kuch aisa kar baithte hai, jo unke rishte kii wo pehali kasak or ahsaas ko kahin kho dete hai
 As much as it is important to understand each other's feelings for a happy life, it is also important to keep your relationship away from sex for some time before marriage
 are janaab, thode hi to dinon kii baat he phir to wo aapaki or aap unke
 So do you want to know what is the secret of a happy marriage
 kaise laai ja sakati he rishte main mithaas
 If yes, sir, for this you will have to wait for sex till honeymoon

 Leading study Brigham Young University Prof
 dean basbe ne kaha, is vishay par zyaadaatar shodh vyakti ke yon anubhavon par aadhaarit hote hai na ki uske samay par
 There are more things than sexual activity in relationships and we found that people who waited longer
 unke sambandhon kaa yon pahalu zyada khushhaal rahaa
 According to the study, those who were waiting for sexual intercourse till the honeymoon said that their mutual relations are more lasting and satisfying, whereas these elements were seen less among those who had sex before marriage

 kahaneh 'dringroom'- raajakmal choudharisidhiyon kaa rasta bahut patala tha or din main bhi andhera chaaya rahata tha
 The darkness was more so, as i climbed the stairs, feeling that my feet wanted to return
 phone par jab unase main baaten kar rahaa tha, tab bhi soch rahaa tha ki achaanak phone rakh don, baaten band kar don
 There was so much sweetness and so much aristocracy in his words, in the manner of talking, in the accent, in the accent
 arestokrasi se mujhe baraabar bhay lagata rahaa he
 i have never been afraid of wealth
 badi-badi companiyon ke diarectaron ke shitatanukulit kamaron main nirbhay-nizshank ghus jaataa hoon
 i have an introduction to Alchessians and Terriers
 magar abhijatya se mujhe dar lagata he
 Childhood was spent in homegrown princely states, and then, when princely owners and nawabs used to hunt, go to Europe, and raise singers and wrestlers, not set up business firms, do not stand in elections with Congress tickets
 Gandhi was not wearing a hat
 ab vah samay nahin rah gaya he, magar arestokrasi se mujhe dar lagata he
 So, while talking to Irene on the phone, i was scared and now, while climbing these narrow and dark stairs, i am scared too
 pataa nahin, meri maamuli-si shakl, or mere maamuli se kapadon ko dekh irine par kya prabhaav padegaa
 But now there are four or six steps
 colbel bajaane par do baaten huin
 From inside the room, a big beautiful dog got quiet by barking two or three times
 or, naukaraani kii tarah dikhti hui ek aurat ne darwaja aadha kholaa, or sir baahar nikaalkar poocha, kisko khojataa he
 My name, Dayanand, has come to see Miss Irene Thakur, - did not even finish saying that the door closed, the face of a woman looking like a maid disappeared
 saamne band darwaja tha, or daravaaje par plastic kii plate par likhaa tha, misses catherine thakur
 That is, Irene's mother
 irine kii maan france kii yaa belgium kii thi yaa checkoslovakia kii hai, aisa mujhe pehle se pataa he
 Irene's father was a high-descent Brahmin, and a high-ranking officer in the Air Force
 pita ab nahin hai
 Neither is mother
 sirf plastic kii nemplate he
 Suddenly i am sad to think that Irene is not a mother
 badi tej ichha hui ki ek baar unase mil paata
 Looking at their eyes, and their faces and their words, listening, trying to understand what strength was there in their soul, which could give them the courage to abandon all their things, they ended up leaving Europe, always She went for yaa, shakti unamem nahin thi, irine ke pita main thi?darwaja phir khulaa, or choubees-pachchis kii ek ladki ne mujhase kaha, "andar aa jaaie
 "" Come in
 "A girl of twenty-four and twenty-five said to me, and smiled
 is muskaraahat main nayaapan nahin tha, arestokrasi bhi nahin thi
 It was the same as in the receptionists of big hotels or big offices
 lagata he ki yah muskaraahat meri chir-parichit he
 This person seems to have met before
 lagata he, or ham achaanak hi, bahut aaraam or halkaapan or taazgi mahasoos karne lagate hai
 i didn't feel it at all, because, this grin is my profession
 ladki kinare hatati hui boli- "aap baithiye, didi bath le rahi hai, das minute main aa jaaengi
 “the drawingroom was not so big
 mere thik saamne ek lanbaa sopha padaa tha or sofe par teen ladkiyaan japani gudiyon kii tarah baithi thim
 On the left side there was a second sofa, on which two grown men were seated
 dayee taraf teesraa sopha tha, jis par ek yuvak akelaa baitha tha
 There were three girls on three sofas, and a round table in the middle
 tebul par chaandi ke ek puraane guladaste main chaandi kii ek nangi ladki khadi thi, or uskaa ek haath jaanghon kii raksha kar rahaa tha, upar uthe hue duusare haath main gulab ke chand taaja phool the
 The two adults together said- "it is time for the club, let us go now
" "japani gudiyon kii tarah dikhti hui teen ladkiyaan muskaraayi, or uthakar khadi ho gayi
 The young man sitting alone said to me - "sit
 didi abhi aati hi hongi
 Waiting for you phir bath lene chali gayi
 "the older man walked out of the room, passing by my side, and looking at me with sharp eyes
 sidhiyon se neeche utar gaye
 The room had two doors, as is often the case in the drawingroom
 duusare daravaaje se teenon ladkiyaan chali gayi
 The young man also went after them
 sirf, mujhe andar le aane vaali ladki daravaaje ke paas khadi rahi
 i sat in a chair
 "nahin, sofe par aaraam se baithiye
 Sister will come immediately
 ve aapaki hi pratiksha kar rahi thim," usne mujhase kaha, or main sofe par baithkar cigarette jalaane laga
 Ash moved towards the tray at the corner of the corner
 usne teji se aish trey uthaa liya
 And put it on the arm of my couch, or on the table
 or mujhase takaraa gai
 My glasses fell off the eyes and fell on the floor
 tutaa nahin
 He shouted loudly, "sorry! I'm very sorry
" "main uski cheekh se dar gaya
 Then, he said- "no, there is nothing to be sorry
 "maine aashwaasan diya, to vah dubaara muskaraai, or saamne kii kursi par baith gai
 She sat and looked at me
 main uski taraf dekhne laga
 After looking at it for a long time, i asked- "are you Irene's sister?" "yes! The biggest is Irene
" phir, lilu yani lilian hai, jo sabase bain taraf baithi thim
 Then i am phir, shilu he, jo sabase dayee taraf thi
 Then, Mini
 ham log paanch bahanen hai
 There is a brother, Subhash, who has just gone in, ”he answered in detail
 maine poocha- "aapane apana naam to bataaya hi nahin
 "then Irene arrived
 aati-aati hi boli- "iskaa naam he shakuntla
 Mother was reading Kalidasa's plays in those days
 magar, un naatakon kaa is par koi asar nahin padaa he
 It is very talkative, and it does not work except to quarrel with the sisters
 "shakuntla sharmaane lagi
 Irene collapsed on the couch, stopping in a braided strand of hair lying in her hand
 irine kaa turant dhulaa hua cheharaa mujhe acha laga
 There was no makeup on his face, yet he did not seem to have crossed the age of thirty
 bina baahon vaali lo-cat blouse or khaadi kii safed sari main vah jaraa bhi videshini nahin dikhti thi
 i had heard that Irene had lived in France for twenty-two years
 magar, chehre par yaa sharir par kahin bhi france nahin tha, europe nahin tha
 The hair was open and spreading from the waist down on the back
 baanhen khuli thim, or sangemarmar kii bani maaloom hoti thim
 Shakuntala walked out of the room
 main chupchaap baitha rahaa
 Irene tied the temporari knuckles by wrapping her hair
 juda baandhne kii kriya ke vakt meri ankhen uski baahon se chipki raheen, or main aatankit hota rahaa
 Terrified because Irene was unknowingly displaying her body, and her body itself was the most beautiful example of physical elitism, and i do not know why i am such that i would be terrorized by the female body and by the nobility
 Have been "beyara, ham logon ke liye coffee le aao!" kisi adrishy shakti ko sambodhit karte hue, irine ne bade hi sulalit kanth se pukaara
 After a minute, the coffee arrived
 coffee kaa trey uthaae ek nepali ladkaa aayaa
 Two empty cups, a coffee-pot, a cup of milk, a cup of sugar, a large saucer containing mangoes and bananas and pieces of orange, the little girl with flowers was slightly moved and placed on a tray
 irine muskaraai
 And started making coffee
