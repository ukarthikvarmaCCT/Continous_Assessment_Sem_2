 isamen sabase mahatvapurn goa forverd party rahi jisane teen siten jiti or vijay saradesai is party ke pramukh hai

 dilli ke grih mantri satyendra jain dwaara grih vibhaag main karyrat dilli, andaman and nicobar islands civil sarvice (DANICS) ke do adhikariyon ke nilamban ke khilaaf guuruuvaar ko unke saathi karmchaariyon ne hadtaal karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 But after the controversy escalated, his suspension has been stopped by the central government
 satyendra jain ne kaha ki unhen kisi bhi tarah kii hadtaal kii koi jaankaree nahin he
 He said that suspension is a matter of administration and the cabinet cannot take any decision in it
 unhone kaha, 'adhikari mujhe ye nahin kah sakate ki uparajyapal ne hamen kaam nahin karne ke liye kaha he
 The governor should have given a written order
 'chuttee par chalem jaaensatyendra jain ne kaha, 'karmchaaree ek din kii hadtaal karne kii bajaae chuttee par kyon nahin chale jate? tab ham bataaenge ki acchhee sarkaar kaise chalati he
 "what is the matter? Yashpal Garg and Subhash Chandra, Special Secretary in the Home Department of Delhi Government, were suspended two DANICS officers
 association ne donon ke nilamban kaa virodh karte hue ise waapas lene kii maang kii thi
 DANICS says that the Delhi government does not have the authority to suspend its officer
 nilamban ke khilaaf MHA ko chittheedhanichhsh association ne donon adhikariyon ko suspend kiye jane ke dilli sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf kendriya grih mantralay ko chitthee likhi thi
 In the letter, the association demanded the suspension
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne nilamban waapas le liya
 Where did the matter start? It is a matter of increasing the salary of government lawyers and Tihar Jail employees
 dilli sarkaar ne centre sarkaar kii manjuuri liye bina cabinet se paas karke up-rajyapal ke paas file bheji thi
 LG sent it to the central government without approving the rules
 satendra jain ne in adhikariyon se is sambandh main notification jari karne ko kaha lekin niyamon ko aadhaar banaakar isamen anakani karne par jain ne donon ko nilambit kar diya
 What is the rule? According to the rules, only the President has the right to fix the salary of these employees
 haalanki uparajpal kii sahmati se is sambandh main notification jari kiya ja saktaa he, lekin mantri ne bina uparajyapal kii anumati ke hi adhikariyon par notification main hastakshar karne kaa dabaav banaaya
 The authorities refused to sign, citing the rules as the Lieutenant Governor himself has instructed them not to sign any such paper without their consent
 nilamban kaa adhikaar LG ke pasis faisle se sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich phir se takaraar badhane ke asaar hai, kyonki senior adhikariyon ko suspend karne kaa adhikaar sirf uparajyapal ko he, jo grih mantralay kii anumati milane ke baad hi aisa kar sakate hai
 Angered by this decision of the government, all the officials of Danix had announced to go on a day off

 dilli vidhansabha main sarkaar dwaara laae vishwasamat prastaav par bolte hue congress ke pradeshdhyaksh arvinder singh lavali ne kaha ki agar aap sarkaar janhit main kaam karti he to party puure paanch saal tak samarthan de sakati he
 He said, 'kejriwal ji you are constantly making statements that the government is for 48 hours
 main aaj aapako aashwast karata hum ki jab tak aap dilli ke logon ke hit main faisla lete rahenge tab tak aapaki sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 ' unhone kaha 'jarurat padane par ham aapako paanch saal tak samarthan karenge jisase ki aap acchhee sarkaar de sake, jab tak hamen lagegaa ki jo faisla aapane kiya he usase vikaas baadhit nahin ho rahaa he ham aapkaa samarthan karte rahenge
 Whatever you decide in the interest of the people and for development, our party will be supported there
 ' The Congress leader said that his party has supported the government to save the people of Delhi from another election
 baharhaal, lavali ne bijli or pani aapurti muft karne ke faisle par sarkaar par yah kehete hue hamalaa kiya ki ek se duusare jagah sabsidi ke sthanantaran par sadan faisla kar sakati he, sarkaar nahin
 Lovely told the Chief Minister, 'you are new in the government
 adhikariyon ko aapako acchhee tarah bataanaa chahie
 The earlier budget approved some subsidies and now cannot change
 sadan kii hissedari honi chahie
 You should decide the responsibility of the officials, who misled you
 ' He also expressed surprise that if the decision is to give a subsidy of Rs 1300 crore, then what promises will the government put on hold
 unhone kejariwal se yah bhi kaha ki unki sarkaar ko bhrashtachar main salypt logon or vibhaagon ke khilaaf 'kadi karrwai' kerani chahie
 Lovely said that when Kejriwal talked about corruption of Delhi government, he also talked about MCD

 However, several groups have condemned the firing incident

 Researchers at the US University of Hawaii reported that this outer planet, identified as Kepler-1658b, is similar to the giant hot Jupiter, which is every 3

 He told that from the surface this planet appears to be 60 times larger than the diameter of our Sun

 Despite being the 1st candidate planet discovered by the @nasakepler telescope, Kepler-1658b had a rocky road to confirmation
 10 years later, scientists have now confirmed that it is, in fact, a planet
 It whips around its star every 3

 Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju has criticized efforts to create a 'villain-like' image of India in the Rohingya case, saying it is a deliberate exercise to tarnish the country's image

 Rijiju said that in the case of people of Rohingya community entering India illegally, the country's security has been ignored in the criticisms of India
 unhone twit kar kaha ki 'is maamle main bharat ko khalanaayak bataanaa bharat kii chhavi ko dhoomil karne kii sochi samajhi kavayad he
 India's security has been ignored in these criticisms'
 This chorus of branding India as villain on Rohingya issue is a calibrated design to tarnish India's image
 It undermines India's security

 Well played
 We are all very proud of you
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 15, 2015 Before chasing a target of 301 runs, no batsman in the team of Uttar Pradesh except Ahmed Shahzad and Misbah ul Haq could show the strength to stand in front of the Indian bowlers
 paak captain misbah ul haq ne team kii haar taalane kii bharsak koshish kii, lekin duusare chor se unhen koi madad nahin mili
 Misbah made a relentless effort but Shami bowled her back to a personal score of 76
 misbah ne apni pari main 9 chauke or 1 chakka lagaaya
 See, India's next match when Mohammad Shami from India took a brilliant four wickets, while Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma got two successes, while Ashwin and Jadeja got one each
 isse pehle 11 ke score par younis khan (6) kaa wicket ganvaane ke baad ahamed shahzad (47) or sohail khan (36) ne pakistan kii pari ko sambhala
 Ashwin broke this pair of both batsmen who looked dangerous at one time
 aswin kii gend par sohail ko raina ne kaich kiya
 After this, Dhoni put Umesh Yadav on the bowling front
 apane captain ke faisle ko sahi sabit karte hue umesh yadav ne shoeb makasuud ko raina ke haathon kaich kara diya, to umr akmal jadeja kii gend par dhoni ke haathon lapke gaye
 However, the bowler's appeal to Umar Akmal was rejected by the umpire, after which captain Dhoni sought a decision for a third umpire and India got their fifth success
 paanch wicket girane ke baad shahid afridi or misbah ul haq ne pari ko aage badhaane kii jimmedaari apane kandhon par uthaai
 Mohammed Shami broke the crucial partnership between the two batsmen
 shami kii gend ko uthaakar maarane ke chakkar main afridi gend ko hawa main khel baithe or kohli ne kaich main lapakane main koi galati nahin kii
 Wahab Riaz, who came to the crease to replace Afridi, also became a victim of Mohammed Shami
 unhen shami kii gend par dhoni ne wicket ke peeche lapka
 Captain misbah-ul-haq decided to fight alone and hit a struggling half-century to overcome his team's troubles, losing seven wickets for 154 runs
 yasir shah ke saath misbah ne aathven wicket ke liye mahatvapurn ran jode or team kaa score 200 ke paar pahunchaaya
 Mohit Sharma gave Pakistan the eighth blow on the score of 203
 mohit kii gend ko uthaakar khilne ke chakkar main yasir 30 gaj ke daayre main umesh yadav ke haathon lapke gaye
 Team India stalled by 300, losing consecutive wickets in the last over, Team India, once leading to a big score, stumbled to 300 runs
 pakistan ke saamne yah match jeetne ke liye 301 ran kaa lakshya rakhaa

 Earlier Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina batted brilliantly for India
 kohli ne 126 gendon main 107 ran kii joardaar pari kheli or 45wein over tak ek chor thame rakhaa
 Kohli hit 8 fours in his innings
 jaaniye bharat kaa aglaa muqabla kab he
 
 bharat or pakistanke bich ye worldcup kaa chatha muqabla tha
 India got the toss for the fifth time in six matches and India also chose to bat for the fifth time
 ballebaajon kii madadgaar pich par do spinners ke saath utarane kii ranneeti team india pehle hi bana chuki thi, lihaaja jadeja or aswin donon hi team kaa hissaa bane
 Pakistan also placed a special leg-spinner, Yasir Shah, and for this, the team's specialist wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed was dropped and Umar Akmal was given the responsibility behind the wicket
 rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ne sadhi shuruuaat, to kii lekin isse pehle ki donon ballebaaj haath kholte rohit sharma kii jaldbaaji ne pakistan ko mauka de diya
 Rohit has played excellent innings in the last few matches, but in the innings in which he does not make runs, his way of getting out is always under question
 15 ran unke balle se nikle or sohail khan kii gend par pul karne kii koshish main misbah ne unhen lapak liya
 Virat Kohli tried to increase the run speed as soon as he came to the crease
 shikhar dhawan bhi tikkar khilne aae the
 Both of them played Pakistani batting without any trouble without taking the pressure of the big match
 donon ne milakar team ko pehle 100 or phir 150 ke paar pahunchaa diya
 During this time, both had also completed their half-century
 30wein over tak team kaa score 163 tak pahunch chukaa tha or isi score par ek ran lene kii koshish main donon kaa talmail bighad gaya or non striker and par khadey dhawan, misbah kii thro se pehle krij main nahin pahunch paae
 But in such a big match, this innings of 73 runs from 76 balls was recorded in history
 viraat ke aage pakistani gendbaaj pani bhar rahe the or unke fielders ek ke baad ek kaich chhodkar viraat ko aage badhane kaa hausala dete ja rahe the
 Taking advantage of the three lives on 3, 16 and 76, Virat raised the hopes of a century
 duusare chor se unhen saath mila suresh raina kaa jinhone aate hi tabadatod ran barasaane shuru kar die
 Together, they started scoring at an average of around 7
 15
 In the partnership that lasted 3 overs, both added a total of 110 runs
 is dauraan viraat ne wo karishma bhi kiya jo aaj tak kisi bhartiya ballebaaj ne pakistan ke khilaaf worldcup main nahin kiya tha
 Virat scored a tremendous century, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's record of 98 runs in the 2003 World Cup
 126 gendon main viraat ne 107 ran kii pari kheli jisamen unhone 8 chauke jade
 Virat had also played a valuable innings of Indian cricket history before he was caught by Sohail Khan to Omar Akmal
 ab 300 kii ummid jaag chuki thi
 In the big match, Raina was in his color and Pakistani bowler in the can
 sirf 56 gendon par 5 chaukon or 3 chhakkon kii madad se 74 ran banaakar sohail khan ke tisare shikaar ban gaye
 After this Dhoni came and brought high hopes, but in the Death Overs, Pakistan bowlers were ready to return
 ab bharat ke liye bade shots lagane mushkil hone lage
 The balls of Wahab Riaz and Sohail Khan started taking the test of Team India
 jadeja (3), dhoni (18) or rahane bina khaataa khole laute
 Alam was that India scored only 27 runs in the last five overs and lost five wickets during this period
 bharat ke khilaaf apane pehle hi worldcup match main 5 wicket lene kaa karnama karne vaale sohail khan bhi is match ke liye hameshaa yaad kiye jaaenge
 Well in the last over, Mohammed Shami and r Ashwin together brought Team India to 300 somehow
 pakistan ke saamne kisi team kaa worldcup main ye teesraa sabase bada score he

 hawa se bate karne vaala chust or swamibhakt 'chetak' agar nahin hota to maharana pratap kii veerta ke kisse utane viraras se otprot nahin hote jitne aaj hai
 The legend of Saryu Rai is incomplete without even 'chetak' , a veteran leader of Bihar who went to rum in the new state politics after the formation of Jharkhand 
 ab jaahir he, yahaan chetak kisi ghode kaa naam nahin hi hoga
 Because in the eighties the horse riding did not go well
 lekin 'bajaj chetak' to us samay yuvaaon ke dil kii dhadkan hua karata tha
 What the youth of today sitting on 'harley Davidson' must have loved as much as the rider of 'chetak' used to travel
 khayr, scooter kii mahima phir kabhi
 But Philhar talks about veteran leader Saryu Rai's Chetak
 sarayu raay apane is 'chetak' se maharana pratap ke mukaable zyada nahin to kuch kam bhi prem nahin karte hai
 This is the scooter on which Saryu Rai fought the fodder scam against Lalu Yadav in the nineties
 wo kehete hai, ''sibiai ke ek bade afasar ne ek baar kaha ki mere upar khatra he
 i must move around with security in four wheels
 lekin pataa nahin kyon mujhe aisa lagata rahaa ki main apane scooter par hi mahfuj hum''
 Vishwamitra's Tapubhoomi Buxar's Saryu Rai's attitude is no less than that of Maharana Pratap
 teen-teen mukhyamantriyon (lalu, jagannatha mishra or madhukodaa) ko jail bhijwane vaale sarayu raay jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav main bhi maujuuda mukhyamantri raghuvar das ko jail bhijwane kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 With a bundle of scams, Saryu Rai is saying, "having sent three to jail, it is now the turn of the fourth
" ''to jaisaa swami vaisaa bhakt
 Both of them boast
 1980 main kharide gaye di i es-1490 number ke 'chetak' kii thasak aaj bhi barkaraar he
 a close associate of Saryu Rai said, "scooter sweeps regularly
 '' sarayu raay kaa yah aadesh he ki 'chetak' kaa rakrakhaav dhang se kiya jaae
 This scooter is still safe in the Raghuvansh apartment in Patna
 haalanki is scooter kii sawari ab kabhi-kabhaar hi ho paati he
 Saryu Rai considers Chetak very lucky
 idhar, sarayu raay bhaajapa se baagi hokar maujuuda mukhyamantri ke khilaaf morcha khole hue hai
 On the other hand, the gleaming 'chetak' is also ready to wait for his master for the same old slap
 'chetak' par jo bhi chadha vah khaas ho gaya!pashchim bengal main trinmul congress main vitt evam udyogmantri amit mitra iske pehle swami hai to duusare swami sarayu raay bhi raghuvar das kii sarkaar main sansadeey maamalon or khadyaa aapurti mantri rahe
 Saryu Rai also considers this scooter extremely lucky
 ve kehete hai, is scooter savaar hone ke baad hi mitra or main mantri bane
 However, Saryu Rai says, why both of us, as many people who rode this scooter, are waving the glory in politics and journalism today
 bihar ke siem nitish kumaar se lekar dipti siem susheel kumaar modi, kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad, ashvini kumaar choube yaa phir argedy ke stallwart lalu prasad, jagadanand singh, shivanand tiwari or abdul baari siddiki tak sabane kisi na kisi kaaran se assi ke dashak main is chetak kii sawari kii he
 How did Chetak reach Saryu Rai? The situation today is that companies are asking you to sell two-wheelers or four-wheelers
 teen-chaar ghante main kagaji karrwai ke baad gaadi aapaki
 But this was not the case earlier
 bajaj chetak kii booking 1970 main kii gai or isaki delivery 1980 main hui
 After riding it in Delhi for two years, in 1982, Mitra sold it to his friend Saryu Rai
 15 varshon tak sawari karne baad sarayu raay ise apane bhattije santosh raay ko dekar jharkhand kii siyasat karne chale gaye
 The first Swami of Chetak, who is now a minister in the extreme left party, 'amit Mitra' wanted to contest the BJP in 1980
 ve america kii duk uniwarsity se padhai karne ke baad jab bharat aae to rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii vichaardhaara se aakarshith hokar bhagava dhvaj uthaane kaa man banaaya
 He came to Patna and stayed in the Sangh headquarters
 yahaan unki mulaakaat sarayu raay se hui
 Amit Mitra had made up his mind to contest the Lok Sabha elections on a BJP ticket, but the Sangh and the local unit of the BJP were not in favor of making any outsider a candidate
 jab bhaajapa main mauka nahin mila to amit mitra janata party kii yuva wing ke rashtriya mahasachiv ban gaye
 Well, in politics, ideologies thrive and thrive when given a chance
 jahaan mauka mila vichaardhaaraein bhi apni dharaaen badal leti hai
 As happened with Amit Mitra
 ferj kiijie agar us samay unhen bihar kii sangh or bhaajapa kii sthaneey ikai ne mauka de diya hota to ve sangh ke bilkul vipareet vichaardhaara vaali party trinmul main na hote
 Well, now it is also difficult to tell when, who, which party will come and when, who, which party will go? telling
 raay ne bihar ke ek varisht patrkaar ko yah kissa jaise bataaya, vaise hi ise padhie, ''main apni rajdoot motor cycle par amit mitra ko peeche bithakar nalanda uniwarsity kaa khandhar dikhaane le gaya tha
 When my motorcycle was stolen, Amit Mitra sold his Bajaj 'chetak' scooter in 1982 and went to teach me abroad because he had a bad attitude towards politics'
 subhash chandra bose ke naati amit mitra 1990 main bharat laut aae or kai varshon tak ve fikki ke general secretary rahe
 In 2008, Mitra was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India
 isi daur main ve mamata banerjee ke sampark main aae
 As a Trinamool Congress nominee contested the 2011 elections and remained invincible for 5 elections

 Broad admitted that India's bowling attack is brilliant, which has proved itself in the last few overseas tours
 broad ne iespncricainfo ko die intervyuu main kaha, 'unki gendbaaji unki safalataa kaa kaaran rahi he
 They know what their strength is and what can threaten them here, whether it is spin or reverse swing
 'broad ne kaha, 'wo in sabhi par charchaa kar rahe honge
 Every field will be different and the conditions there too
 bhartiya team shandaar he
 He has great players and has quickly molded himself into situations around the world
 yah behad rochak siries hogi
 'forgetting IPL friendship in Test series, i will hit the ground: Butlerbrod says that due to the current season of England, pitches will be helpful to spinners and hence there will not be much weight on the fast bowlers
 is tej gendbaaj ne kaha, 'yah bataanaa mushkil he ki siries kis tarah se bitegi
 If the pitches are helpful to the spinners, then there will be more work on the shoulders of the spinners
 aise main tej gendbaajon par zyada dawaab nahin hoga
 We will not see it as a series of five Test matches
 'kohli ne thaan liya to england ke liye ho jaaegi mushkil: graham goochbroad ke mutabik, 'ham match dar match aage badhenge

 Both teams know what the pitches will be like
 granudsman bhi isse waakif hai, kyonki wo england main is tarah ke mausam kaa anubhav kar chuke hai
 There will be moisture in the pitch
 khilaadiyon ko jald hi talmail bithaana padegaa
 Broad said he was more than happy that it was a five-test series
 bakaul broad, 'main jis baat kaa sabase zyada lutf uthaaungaa vah yah he ki ye paanch test maichon kii siries he
 Usually your best team wins the five-match series

 In our country, no matter how many proverbs have been prevalent, but all of us must have been brought up with the "you will jump, you will read, you will write, the Nawab"
 haalanki badalte samay or daur main in kahawaton kii dhar kund padi he
 Now our generation is harmonizing with sports as well as sports
 khilne-kudane waalon ko ab doum darje kaa maanane ke bajaay sammaan se dekha ja rahaa he
 There are many examples of such players whether playing cricket (virat Kohli - University of Delhi), Pahlavani - Sakshi Malik, or Badminton - PV Sindhu
 puraa desh unhen ummid or sammaan se dekhtaa he
 Apart from this, who does not know Sachin Tendulkar, who is called the God of cricket in India today
 gauratlab he ki sachin tendulkar kaa acedimak record shuruaati dinon main kuch khaas nahin tha
 They also failed in school days
 haalanki baad ke dinon main unhone padhai bhi puri kii or angreji bhi bolne lage
 The mention of speaking English is because in our country, speaking English is still considered a measure of being educated
 desh main padhai karte hue sports khilne kii parampara ko boost dene ke kram main alag-alag skool or vishvavidhyalay sports cote ke tahat bhi daakhila dete hai
 Not only this, the students enrolled in sports quota in these universities also represented the country in the past Olympics Games
 naukari milane main hogi aasaani
 
 
 Students enrolled in the sports quota at the university represent state, zone and national level universities, and winning medals also provide jobs in various services in the country such as railways, banking and military
 ve vahaan bhi services kii ore se sports khilne kaa kaam karte hai
 They get sports allowances, holidays and facilities so different
 ve in services kii ore se khelte-khelte desh kaa pratinidhitiv bhi karne lagate hai
 Example- Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 ve khel ke dam par hi railway main tikat colector hue or aage acha khelte hue indian cricket team ke captain bhi bane
 After all these things, the most important thing that comes out is how to balance with sports along with studies
 sports main participet karne waalon ko kis tarah kii dikkatein aati hai
 How they deal with them and motivate themselves
 ab is baat se to sabhi waakif honge ki sports khelnaa hamase atirikt saavdhaanee or energy kii maang karata he
 For this, athletes and athletes resort to protein rich diet
 aisa karne kii chaah rakhane waalon ko apni life main disiplin ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 Without discipline, he kept getting results in sports

 He is said not to do any kind of education and all sportsmen do not succeed in this country

 Success will kiss your footsteps
 madhyapradesh main congress nit sarkaar doodh ke parlor par kadakanath murge kaa maance bechney kii yojana bana rahi he, taaki isaki badhati maang ko puraa kiya ja sake
 However, BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma objected to the government's move, saying it would hurt the sentiments of Hindus as cow and its milk are considered 'sacred' in Hinduism
 madhyapradesh ke pashupaalan mantri lakhan singh yadav ne bataaya ki madhyapradesh rajya pashudhan or kukkut vikaas nigam ne kadakanath kii badhati maang ko dekhte hue bhopal ke vaishali nagar kshetra main doodh ke parlor par kadakanath murge kaa maance bechney kii yojana shuru kii he
 He said, 'we have set up a booth in the state capital Bhopal for experimental sale of meat of Karkanath chicken
 ham aise parlor puure rajya main kholane kii yojana par charchaa kar rahe hai
 However, Yadav said that the future of the scheme depends on the success of the pilot project
 unhone kaha ki vartmaan main kadakanath kaa maance 900 rupee prati kilogram kii dar par bechaa ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma objected to the government's move, saying that cow and its milk are considered very sacred in Hinduism
 iskaa kai tyoharon main or upwas main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Cow milk and Kadaknath meat should not be sold in a booth
 unhone kaha ki vah sarkaar se doodh or kadakanath kaa maance bechney ke liye alag alag parlor sthapit karne kaa aagrah karenge
 Asked about this objection, the minister clarified that separate cabins will be built inside the parlor to sell both the things
 maaloom ho ki kadakanath murge kii utpatti madhyapradesh ke jhabua jile main hui he
 According to experts, Kakarnath meat is very high in iron and protein, while cholesterol is found to be much less than the hens of other species
 isliye yah anya prajatiyon ke murgon se adhik keemat main bechaa jaataa he
 a post shared by The Nun (@thenunmovie) on Sep 4, 2018 at 6:05 pm PDT loksabhaa chunaav kaa teesraa muqabla kal (23 april) he, jisamen 117 siton par matdaan hona he
 The ten seats in Uttar Pradesh to be voted on in this phase include Mainpuri, Badaun and Firozabad
 ye teenon siten mulaayam singh yadav parivaar kaa garh hai
 This time the picture is a bit different as Shivpal Yadav from Firozabad is contesting against his nephew
 is tarah tisare charan main yadav parivaar ke chaar sadasyon kii kismat par faisla hona he
 Despite the Modi wave in 2014, the BJP could not penetrate the strong fort of Mulayam
 mainpuri seat se khud samaajawaadee party ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav chunaav lard rahe hai
 Mulayam Singh has contested from here for the fifth time
 ladaai ke lihaaj se dekhen to le-dekar vipaksh ke naam par keval bijepi he
 This sp's stronghold is so strong that no other party has had a win here for the last 24 years
 yahaan tak ki modi lahar ke baavjood 2014 main sapa pratyaashee saadhe teen lakh se zyada maton se jeet darj kii thi
 However, two seats MP Mulayam Singh Yadav had vacated the Mainpuri seat, on which his grandson Tej Pratap Singh Yadav defeated BJP candidate Prem Singh Shakya by 3 lakh 21 thousand votes in the by-election
 isse mainpuri main sapa kii majbootee kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In Firozabad, the situation is different this time in Mulayam's brother Shivpallekin Badaun and Firozabad in front of his nephew
 shivpal singh yadav sapa se alag hokar apni party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party bana chuke hai or wo khud firozabad seat se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Shivpal has Akshay Yadav, son of his nephew i
e
 Ramgopal Yadav
 chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai ne is baar firozabad ke chunaav ko dilachasp bana diya he
 This battle is not only electoral, but also survival
 firozabad seat par jat, muslim, dalit or yadav votaron kaa varchasv he, lekin sapa, basapa gathbandhan or shivpal yadav ke siyaasi sangram main utarane se muqabla dilachasp ban gaya he
 However, in the fight between uncle and nephew, BJP is trying to feed lotus
 haalanki, modi lahar main bhi bijepi is seat par 2014 main jeet nahin saki thi
 The Congress did not give up on the Badaun seat
 Similarly, there was no effect of Modi wave in Badaun and other members of Mulayam family Dharmendra Yadav are fighting on the SP ticket
 bijepi se yogi sarkaar ke mantri swami prasad maury kii beti sanghmitra maury kismat aajamaa rahi hai or congress ke purv mantri saleem sherwani ran main hai
 This is the seat where the Congress has fielded its candidate against a member of the Yadav family, due to which the contest seems triangular
 badaayun seat se dharmendra yadav kii raah main sabase bada sirdard saleem sherwani ban gaye hai
 Sherwani has been an MP from this seat four times
 jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se dekhen to saadhe chaar lakh muslim, dhai lakh yadav, teen lakh dalit, ek lakh jat, sava lakh brahman, ek lakh maury, ek lakh rajput matadaata hai
 In such a situation, if Congress candidate Sherwani is successful in helping Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins, then it will be difficult for Dharmendra to make a hat-trick
 vahiin, sanghmitra maury apane samaaj ke saath-saath hindu maton ko ekajute karne main lagi hai
 Overall, in the third phase of UP seats where Yadav family members are contesting elections, except for Mainpuri seat of Mulayam Singh Yadav, the road is not easy
 firozabad main apane parivaar ke hi shivpal yadav ne sapa ke sameekaran bigaad die hai to badaayun main congress ne damdaar pratyaashee utarkar dharmendra yadav kii dhadakanen tej kar di hai
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how SP National President Akhilesh Yadav can save his family from these challenges

 Placements: Here many big companies come for placements: - Asian Paints, Ashok Leyland City City Bank HDFC Life HDFC Life Reserve Bank of India TCS (TCS) Wipro Infotech itihasvid ramchandra guha kii kitaab ‚Äòindia ofter gandhi‚Äô main is vivaadit vishay par roshni daali gai he
 Referring to one member RV Dhulekar, it is written - When Dhulekar started speaking his speech in Hindustani, the president interrupted him saying that many people present in the meeting do not know Hindi and therefore they do not understand him
 
 is par dhulekar ne tilamilaate hue kaha ki 'jinhen hindustani nahin aati, unhen is desh main rahane kaa haq nahin he
 ' 1963 main nehru ne rajbhasha adhinium ko disha dene kaa kaam kiya jiske tahat unhone is baat kii taraf ishaara kiya ki 1965 se aadhikarik rup se sabhi tarah kaa sanchaar hindi main kiya jayega or angreji ko ek sahaayak bhashaa ke rup main istemaal kiya ja ‚Äòsaktaa‚Äô he
 This sign of Nehru raised the ears of Hindi opponents
 unhen is 'saktaa' he main is shankaa kaa sanket mila ki ho saktaa he ki centre ke dwaara gaiyr hindi bhashiyon par hindi 'thopi' jaae, angreji kaa safaya ho jaae or yahi nahin hindi ko rajbhasha ke saath saath rashtrabhasha kaa darja bhi de diya jaae
 After so much opposition, the Congress apparently seemed to soften its decision and Shastri made it clear on All India Radio in his message to the nation that English can be used as long as the public wants it
 saath hi unhone gaiyr hindi bhashiyon ke dar ko dur karte hue aashwaasan diya ki har rajya yah khud tay kar saktaa he ki vah kis bhashaa main sarkari kaamkaaj yaa sanchaar karnaa chahta he, vah kshetreey bhashaa bhi ho sakati he yaa angreji bhi
 At the same time, English as well as Hindi will be the language of functioning and communication at the central level
 itane kade virodh ke baad hindi ko bharat kii rajbhasha kaa darja to mil gaya lekin 'rashtriya bhashaa' kaa darja milte milte rah gaya
 It is different that in many school books, Hindi is declared as the national language, which is factually incorrect because there is no national language of India
 bhartiya samvidhan main kisi ko bhi rashtriya bhashaa kaa darja praapt nahin he
 It has been made clear by the Department of Official Language that Hindi as well as English can also be used for functioning in Parliament and Center
 iske alaava rajyon ko vidhayika ke tahat apni bhashaa khud tay karne kaa adhikaar he jiske falswaroop bharat main 22 bhashaaon ko aadhikarik darja mila hua he jisamen angreji or hindi bhi shaamil he
 It has been made clear by the court on different occasions that all these languages have equal status and no language is more or less than any
 guha kii likhi kitaab main ek or dilachasp kissa he
 After this important announcement by Lal Bahadur Shastri on the radio once again when the matter came up in Parliament, Anglo Indian member Frank Anthony expressed concern over the 'intolerance' of the Hindi speakers of not accepting English
 iske jawaab main je bi kriplani ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki frank ko bharat main apni bhashaa (angreji) ke khatm hone kii chintaa nahin kerani chahie kyonki ‚Äòab to hamaare bachche bhi ammaa-appa nahin mummy papa bolne lage hai
 We even talk to our dogs in English
 ‚Äô apane pair jamaa chuki angreji par kriplani ne tanj kasate hue anthony ko ‚Äòvishwaas‚Äô dilaayaa ki england se angreji gaayab ho sakati he lekin bharat se kabhi nahin
 
 
 There is another interesting anecdote in the book written by Guha
 radio par laal bahadur shastri kii is ahm ghoshnaa ke baad ek baar phir jab yah maamla sansad main uthaa to anglo bhartiya sadsy frank anthony ne angreji ko sweekaar nahin karne kii hindi bhashiyon kii 'ashishnutaa' par chintaa jataai
 In response to this, JB Kripalani jokingly said that Frank should not worry about the ending of his language (english) in India because 'now even our children are starting to speak amma-appa and not Mummy Papa
 yahaan tak kii ham apane kutton se bhi angreji main hi baat karte hai
 Kripalani taunted the English with its feet and gave Anthony the 'confidence' that the English could disappear from England but never from India

 For example, if an officer has completed two years out of three years as a member of the state board and has one year left, then after resigning from his post, he will take up the second post of state board or any post of BCCI One can contest elections but after being elected, that person can stay in this post for only one year
 yani ek saal ke baad use is pad ko chhodana padegaa
 The comments saurav ganguli ke maamle main yah sab lagu hota he
 Saurabh Ganguly is now a member of the Bengal Cricket Association
 june 2017 ko saurav ganguli ke teen saal puure ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, Sourav Ganguly will have to wait for three years to become a member of BCCI or State Board

 jahaan dhumal hamirpur kii sujanpur seat par dhul chaat gaye, vahiin rupani kaa report card ummid se kamazor he
 This is the reason that the claims of the biggest contenders for the post of CM in both the states have evaporated

 By the way, after the victory of Gujarat CM Rupani with a small margin, it is understood that his position will no longer be pre-election
 unke paas bhi ab sansadeey board se tay hue obzarvars kaa munh taakane ke sivaay koi chaara nahin he

 However, Dhumal made his defeat very small in front of the party's victory
 is haar ke baad prem kumaar dhumal ne kaha ki vyaktigat haar myne nahin rakhti, party kii jeet hui
 Dhumal's defeat has raised hopes of many BJP leaders
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki dhumal kii jagah party jin chehron ko himachal kii kursi par baitaane par vichaar kar rahi he usamen sabase pehla naam jai ram thakur kaa he
 He has been a former minister, but he has also worked as a BJP President in Himachal

 bank lokaron ko lambey samay se aabhushan or mahatvapurn kagajaat rakhane kaa surakshit vikalp mana jaataa he
 In recent times there have been many incidents of theft in bank lockers
 bank loker lene ke dauraan hue qaraar ke tahat bainkon ko nuksaan ke liye kisi bhi prakaar se jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Therefore, insuring the contents of the locker can be a prudent step
 ghar kaa beemaa karne vaali policiyaan aabhushanon ko bhi cover karti hai, lekin aap bank loker ke liye bhi beemaa ke vikalp ko dekh sakate hai
 IFFCO-TOKIO has recently introduced the Bank Locker Protector Policy
 kaverejalokar insurance policy main bank kii tijoriyon main nakadi ko chhodkar, rakhe gaye gahane or anya keemtee saamaan ke liye durghatana, sendhamari, aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ke alaava anya chizon ke liye bhi cover shaamil hota he

 "buying Policy" The policy can be purchased only from the branch offices of iffco-tokyo, it is not available online
 zyaadaatar maamalon main aabhushan ke mulya kii swa-ghoshnaa paryaapt he
 If the value of a single item is more than Rs 10 lakhs and the total sum insured is more than Rs 40 lakhs, a valuation report from a government recognized assessor (valuer) is required
 daawa karne ke liye, aapako daawa form ke saath bank ke jariye darj karai gai praathmiki (exiar) kii prati jamaa karaani hogi
 The claim is decided on the basis of the market value of the sum insured
 mandal bataate hai ki sambandhit dastavej jamaa karaane ke baad, daawey ke niptaan main 15 din lagate hai
 Cover under home insurance Some general insurance companies like Allianz also cover jewelery under home insurance, but it usually has a sub-limit and may not get a cover of Rs 40 lakh for jewelery alone
 bajaj aaliyanj general insurance ke chif technical officer shashikumar adidamu kehete hai, ''maai home insurance policy ke tahat ham na keval gharon main balki bank lowers main rakhe gahanon ko bhi cover pradaan karte hai
 The policy provides worldwide coverage
 agar vyakti aabhushan pahanakar / lekar duniya main kahin bhi jaataa he, to bhi aabhushan ko cover diya jaataa he
 Under the bank locker policy, jewelery kept at home or outside the bank locker is not covered
 isliye bank loker policy ke liye dey premium, home insurance ke tahat julri ke beemaa premium se kam he
 Should you buy a separate locker policy? If the contents of the locker are high and the premium is low, then it makes sense to take cover for the risk
 rinyubydotcom ke siio, balchandar shekhar kehete hai, ''loker ke liye alag beemaa karaane kii aavashyaktaa loker main rakhi saamagree kii keemat or samathrya par nirbhar he
 If the price is high and the home insurance coverage is not complete, then it is okay to buy locker insurance and if the stuff kept in the locker is not very valuable and the home insurance coverage is complete then there is no special benefit of locker insurance

 gambhir or sahvaag ne test cricket main aakhri shatkeey saajhedaari disambar, 2010 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf centurian main nibhaai thi
 Both of them then added 137 runs for the first wicket
 iske baad se sahvaag or gambhir 20 pariyon main pari kaa aagaaj kar chuke hai, lekin unki sarvshereshth saajhedaari 89 ran kii he, jo unhone pichley saal westeindies ke khilaaf dilli main nibhaai thi

 " Water was also being looted in Bundelkhand, once a stronghold of dacoits
 yahaan ke chitrakoot dham mandal main pani ke sankat se darjanabhar gaavon ke log pareshaan hai
 There are pipe lines in these villages, but the water from those pipe lines is looted
 darjanabhar gaanvon kaa pani maatr teen gaanv ke log banduukon ke bal par lut lete hai
 The surprising thing is that the government officials who are aware of the situation give a brief answer on the arrangement of water and make people walk
 pani kii rojaanaa ho rahi is lut ke kaaran darjanabhar gaavon ke log pyaase mar rahe hai
 This situation is more or less the same with the animals and birds of the place
 banda jal santhaan bhuragarh se jude gusayari, fatepur, kapasa, tikri, chaandi, bhabhai, biharka, ichaili or nayak purava gaavon ke logon ko pani kii baari killat se jujhna pad rahaa he
 Despite the laying of water tanks and pipe lines in these villages, people here have not had a drop of water for almost a month
 kshetra ke graminon kii maane to banda jal santhaan bhuragarh se chaalu hone vaali pani kii tankiyon ke sameep sthit teen gaanv goyara, achharod va mohanpurva ke log pani lut lete hai
 They carry guns with them, so no one can muster the courage to oppose them

 Some villagers even alleged that the junior engineers at the Mandal Water Institute, Bhuragarh, from where the water supply starts, demand bribe in exchange for water
 desh main dabangon kii dabangai ke chalate logon ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon kii yah ek baangi maatr hai
 The water crisis of this village and the neglect of the officials can be gauged from the fact that due to thirst, many animals and birds have died here so far
 sach to yah he ki graminon ko apni jaan bachaane ke liye do rupee prati litre kii dar se pani khareednaa pad rahaa he
 Alam is that the people here are falling prey to diseases due to lack of water and they are also suffering from epidemics

 While shopping during this season of festival, nobody should give you a fake coin, for this, we tell you some tips to identify it
 
 
 1
 The real coin has a rupee sign, whereas the fake one has only 10 written on it
 2
 The original coin consists of 10 strips, while the counterfeit has 15 strips
 ye strips aapako rupee ke simbel ke upar bani dikhengi
 Can check in the photo
 3
 In a fake coin, 10 is written only on the middle silver part, whereas in real coin it is written slightly below or say on both gold and silver
 padhein: nakli note pahchaanane ke aasaan tareeke4
 On the other side of the real coin, India and INDIA are written separately, while the fake looks written together
 5
 If your coin is fake, you will see a horizontal line below and above the Ashoka pillar seen on the coin, whereas no such line is made in the real coin

 "the IIM-I director said," To be a $ 5,000 billion economy by the year 2022, we will have to grow at a rate of 20 percent and it is impossible to grow at this pace given the current factors
 " raay ne haalanki kaha, "ham 5,000 arab dollar kii arthvyavastha banane ke lakshya ko varsh 2024 yaa 2025 tak hasil kar sakate hai

 "he said that economies around the world are under pressure these days and India's economy also cannot remain untouched by the current impact of geopolitical and geo-strategic factors

 He said, the government first tries to hide the scams, then denies the allegations and is now trying to delay the investigation

 He said that Congress has not intentionally sent the files to CBI after 2004

 Significantly, the CBI is facing a lot of difficulty in the investigation of the Kikoyala scam

 CBI Director Ranjit Sinha said this before the PAC on Wednesday

 The task of investigating the coal scam worth one lakh 86 thousand crore rupees was entrusted to the CBI five months ago
 tees hazaar feet kii oonchai par ek vimaan ud rahaa hota he
 everything was OK
 par tabhi achaanak naa sirf vimaan kaa jameen se conection tut jaataa he balki wo radar se bhi gaayab ho jaataa he
 Everyone feels that the plane may have crashed
 magar phir achaanak pataa chalata he ki jameen se sampark tuutane ke baavjood vimaan aasmaan main kareeb saat ghante tak udata rahaa
 So, the plane hijacked by Malaysian Airlines carrying 239 passengers 10 days ago is in the possession of hijackers? For the last ten days, the biggest mystery of the world has remained the biggest secret that finally 239 passengers and crew members were caught on March 8 on Kuala Lumpur International Malaysia Airlines' Boeing MH 370 aircraft flew from the airport, where did it go? There are many questions that have investigated the agencies around the world Ind has forbidden
 hajaaron mile ke daayre main aasmaan se lekar samandar ke chappe-chappe tak kii khaak chaan maari gai
 Hightech equipment from all over the world were installed in this largest search operation
 lekin laapata vimaan ke bare main to koi suraag nahin mila alabatta kuch aisi chaunkaane vaali jaankaree jarur mili he jo agar sach hua to behad daraavna hoga
 And the truth is that there was neither any technical fault in Flight 370 nor has it been a victim of any accident
 balki jaanboojh kar vimaan ke sanchaar upkarnon ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he or wo bhi kuch is tarah or is makasad se ki duniya kii nigahon se vimaan ko chupa kar kisi gupt jagah par land karaayaa ja sake
 Actually, there are two important reasons for this apprehension
 pehla, tamaam search oparation ke baad abhi tak vimaan kaa malba nahin mila he
 According to CTBTO, an organization that monitors nuclear explosions around the world, its sensors did not record any blasts in Southeast Asia on 8 March
 yani agar vimaan krash hua hota to uske sensors uskaa pataa laga lete
 And the second reason is that after an hour of flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the contact of the aircraft was severed from the air traffic control
 aisa tab hota he jab vimaan main koi bhayankar kharabi aati he
 But surprisingly, the aircraft kept flying for the next seven hours even after the ATC lost contact
 par us root par nahin jisapar use janaa tha balki galat disha main
 That is, there were no technical defects in the aircraft
 malaysia airlines ke laapata bowing 777-200 main jo pahie lage hue hai wo behad khaas hai
 With the help of these wheels the aircraft can be landed on any soft runway apart from the common runway
 itnaa hi nahin in khaas pahiyon kii vajah se vimaan chote ranve par bhi naa sirf utar saktaa he balki techoff bhi kar saktaa he
 According to the experts of such aircraft, the main landing gear of the aircraft ie rear wheels have a set of six wheels on each side i
e
 there are 12 wheels in total
 iske alaava bogi wheels bhi vimaan ko soft ranve par utaarne main madad karti hai
 The technique is that at the time of landing the weight of the aircraft is equal to 12 wheels
 jabaki baaki model main chaar yaa do pahie par hi sara vajan jaataa he isiilie aise khaas pahie vaale vimaan aasaani se kachi zamin yaa sadak par bhi utar jate hai
 That is why there is a suspicion that the aircraft can be landed on temporary runway at some secret place
 ab zaahir he agar vimaan krash nahin kiya or surakshit land hua he to phir bina payalat ke ye mumkin nahin he
 So are the pilots of the missing plane mixed with the hijackers? Or were some people forcibly captured on the plane? There were a total of 227 passengers and 12 crew members in the missing plane
 malaysian adhikariyon ne vimaan main savaar sabhi musafiron kii puri jaankaree nikaali
 After this information, it became clear that there was no suspected passenger in the plane
 yani ab shaq kii sui sidhe kru memberon kii taraf gumti he
 The missing plane was flown by Captain Zahari Ahmed Shah while its co-pilot was Farik Abdul Hamid
 in donon par shaq kii sui to tabhi se ja rahi thi jab america agenciyon ne jaanch main ye paaya tha ki air trephic control se sampark tuutane ke baad bhi vimaan saat ghante tak udata rahaa tha
 Captain Zahari Ahmed Shah, 52 years old, is considered one of the most experienced pilots of Malaysia Airlines
 kwalalampur ke posh ilaake main patni or teen bacchon ke saath rahane vaala jahaari ahamed malaysia ke vipakshi netaa anwar ibrahim kaa kattar samarthak he
 At present, strict police guard has been placed at Zahari Ahmed's house in Kavalalampur
 uske gharavaalon se poochtacha main pataa chalaa he aakhri udaan ke din wo airport apni patni ke saath aayaa tha
 The cabin was also warmly met with crew and passengers
 yahaan tak kii udaan ke dauraan atisi ko die aakhri sandesh main bhi kuch atapata nahin laga tha
 Now the question is that if the aircraft is hijacked by Zahari Ahmed and his co-pilot then what is their purpose? And the biggest question is that if the plane hijack has happened, then where has it landed

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi apane jivan kii sabase mushkil chunauti kaa saamana kar rahe hai, jo surasa ke munh kii tarah lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 The Congress has a crisis to save its personality
 party rahul kii taraf dekh rahi he, lekin congress upaadhyaksh dharmsankat main fanse dikh rahe hai, unke paas doordarshita kaa abhaav dikhataa he
 However, it is not that Rahul cannot get out of this vortex
 unhen bas sahi sarathi kii jarurat he, jo unka maargdarshan kar sake
 The life of Shri Krishna, an avatar of 16 arts, can become an inspiration for Rahul
 rahul krishna ke jivan se jeet kaa sutara paa sakate hai
 One can find these 5 mantras of success from the life of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi Yogeshwar Krishna, who talks about reading Gita and Upanishads
 jo satta kii 'mahabharat' main unhen vijayi bana saktaa he
 Do not get discouraged in any situation, Horahul Gandhi can take a lesson from Krishna's life not to be discouraged under any circumstances
 party kii sthiti kitni bhi kamjor kyon na ho
 The Congress has 44 seats and if it becomes even 4, then there should be no impact on Rahul
 behad ekagra hokar apni ladaai jari rakhni chahie
 While teaching the Gita to Arjuna in Nakurukshetra above the fascination of family and loved ones, Krishna tells him that those who are standing in front are your enemies, not grandfather, uncle and brother
 or dharm kii raksha ke liye inako maarane se koi paap nahin hoga
 Rahul Gandhi can learn that those who are not of party work, whether it is family, friends or relatives
 unhen tatkaal party se baahar karen
 To win in the electoral battle, they will also have to fight against their loved ones
 sangharsh hi jivan hagokul main gwaal bal ke saath 500 se zyada gaayen charaane vaale kanhaiya kaa jivan sangharshon se bharaa he
 Lalla of Nanda who used to feed the cow all day long would have no food in the evening
 unka mamaa kansa unhen maarane ke liye lagaataar apni chaalen chalata rahata
 Krishna never deviated from these obstacles
 ve jivan path par sangharsh karte rahe
 Rahul Gandhi has to do the same
 jivan main sabhi ko anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padataa he or sangharsh sabake hisse main hota he
 Rahul should not be afraid of them
 balki apane raste par aage badhate janaa he
 Keep doing duty without worrying about the fruit
 ranneeti or kootneetihindu granthon main shrikrishna se bada ranneetikaar or kootneetijna nahin hua
 Which bets have to be defeated, and how to kill so many
 ye krishna kii kootnithik kaa hi parinaam tha
 The diplomacy that Krishna introduced against Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, and the manner in which he was killed at the hands of Bhima
 wo sirf krishna hi kar sakate the
 With Kalayavan slaughter, Rahul can learn how to destroy his enemy with the help of the third when two enemies surround you
 lekin iske liye rahul ko jameen par utarana padegaa or janata se judana hoga
 Because without it neither strategy nor diplomacy will form
 haari baazi ko jeetnakurukshetra main kauravon ke paas akshuhinee or chaturangini sena thi
 Krishna also gave his army to Duryodhana
 krishna ko ye pataa tha ki pandavon ke khilaaf bade-bade yoddha he
 Chaturangini forces are
 jeet mushkil he, lekin jeetna dharm sansthapana ke liye jaruri tha
 Krishna was neither nervous nor discouraged
 kootnithik or raajnneetik chaalen chalate hue unhone kauravon ke har maharathi ko maravaaya or haare hue pandavon ke maathe jeet kaa sehara baandh diya
 The Congress has retaliated on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claim of providing one crore jobs in the last one year
 congress kaa kahana he ki modi sarkaar main cabinet mantri nitin gadakari khud kah chuke hai ki desh main naukariyaan nahin hai, piem modi dwaara karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (ipiefo) ke aakadon ko naukari kahana galat he
 On the statement on employment made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an interview, Congress spokesperson Pawan Kheda said that contradictory statements are being made by the government
 kabhi kaha jaataa he ki aankade nahin hai, to kabhi kehete hai ki saal main ek karod naukari di
 It is wrong to call EPFO figures as jobs
 unhone kaha ki trakon ke clinar ko rojgaar bataanaa aankadon ke saath khilwaad karnaa he
 Congress spokesperson Pawan Kheda said that the figures show that more than one crore jobs have gone to the unorganized sector due to demonetisation
 sarkaar ne lebar beuro kaa survey roak diya taaki sahi aankade saamne na aaen
 At the same time, 51 percent beneficiaries of Mudra Yojana have a loan of Rs 23000
 isse kya hoga ?bataa den ki pradhanmantri modi ne samachar agency eenaiko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki jab bharat duniya kii badi arthvyavasthaaon ke bich sabase teji se vikaas kar rahaa he to phir ye kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki rojgaar ke morche par kuch bhi nahin ho rahaa he
 While reiterating his speech on the motion of no confidence in the Lok Sabha, PM Modi questioned that the investment in the country is increasing, the work of road construction, laying of rail lines, construction of solar parks and expansion of transmission line is going on fast
 Then how can it be said that new jobs will not be found? While referring to the data of Employees Provident Fund (EPFO), PM Modi said that 45 lakh new accounts have been opened When does the last 9 months 5
 68 lakh log nai pension skim se jude hai
 This shows that more than 1 crore people have got employment in the last year
 piem ne yah bhi kaha ki rojgaar ko lekar chalaaya ja rahaa dushprachaar ab band hona chaiye
 Because people are not going to make much difference now

 ek kaarykram ke dauraan shridevi se yah puche jane par ki kya vah prabhudeva ke saath film main kaam karne ja rahi hai, unhone kaha, is samay main kai sari filmon kii kahaniyaan sun rahi hum
 Prabhudheva has always been my favorite dancer, actor and choreographer
 yadi mauka mila, to main unke saath jarur kaam karnaa chaahuungi
 Sridevi made a comeback to films with the English 'english Vinglish' last year after a long gap of 15 years, but after that, there is no news of her next film
 prabhudeva or shridevi ko is saal international indian film acedemi (ipha) awords main saath nrity karte dekha gaya tha

 Everyone's eyes are on what the Indian government decides after the attack on Uri's army base camp
 ravivaar se lekar somvaar puure din sarkaar ke sambandhit vibhaagon ke mantriyon adhikariyon or sena pramukhon kii lagaataar baithken chalati raheen
 There is an emergency environment in these departments
 is baar aapako yah badlaav dikhegaa ki sarkaar bhi chup he
 The statements of BJP leaders are closed
 'ek daant ke badale jabada ukhaadne' jaise bayanon se bhi bachane kii hidaayat di gai he
 If nothing has changed, it is the panels of social media and channels
 soshal media main samarthak or virdohi jis tarah kii baaten kar rahe hai, use lekar aap aashwast ho sakate hai ki aise muddon par saarvajanik bahes kaa str kitna gir gaya he
 Opponents are removing the pre-election statements and asking the Prime Minister, tell me what you will do
 bahut kehete the ki ek ke badale das sar kaat kar laayenge, ab laane kaa vakt aa gaya he, laakar dikhaaiye
 When the time for writing love letter is gone, tell me what time has come
 virodhiyon yaa aalochakon ke poochne ke andaaz se aisa lag rahaa he jaise ve bhi maang kar rahe hon ki yuddh karke dikhaane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 On the other hand, supporters are also fighting for the war
 sab fail ho chukaa he, ab sirf yuddh hi bachaa he
 Lessons will have to be taught
 pradhanmantri ko abhi hi faisla karnaa hoga, itihaas unka intazaar kar rahaa he
 On the basis of five-six thousand tweets, they are being asked to go straight to war
 hashtag ko rashtriya janamat bataaya ja rahaa he
 You can see how there has been a decline in the language and thinking of both opponents and supporters
 iske baad comentbazi is par hone lagati he ki wo kahaan gaye jo shanti kii baat karte hai, baatcheet kii baat karte hai
 First, surgical strikes will have to be done on such people within the country
 ek hamale ne hamen kis tarah aapas main bhida diya he or ek jaisaa bana diya he kya ise aap nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 Calling Nawaz Sharif at the swearing-in ceremony, or visiting Lahore on his birthday, is not proof that the Indian government also believes in the way of dialogue
 kya ye faisle shanti kii baat karne waalon se puch kar liye gaye the
 Both these diplomatic decisions of the Prime Minister were described as master strokes
 khaskar unki taraf se jo ravivaar raat se 'prime time' main yuddh kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 Is it so easy for the Prime Minister to take a decision according to the hashtag which does not even number twenty or twenty five thousand, which claims to be a claim of national opinion on its own
 bina soche samajhe parmaanu hamale kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 They are also giving various suggestions to the government
 kai baar in sujhaavon se lagata he ki sarkaar ne isi saal janvari main pathankot hamale ke baad kuch kiya hi nahin
 Recently, at the G20 summit in China, Prime Minister Modi said that among the top leaders of the world, there is only one country in South Asia which was spreading terrorism
 jo is mahamari ko failaa rahe hai un par pratibandh lagane chahie, unhen alag-thalag kiya janaa chahie na ki sammanit kiya janaa chahie

 Now come to the Defense Minister

 In 2015, the Defense Minister has a statement that 65 to 70 percent more terrorists have been killed this time than in 2014
 ve hameshaa kehete rahete hai ki bandook goli khaane ke liye nahin balki chalaane ke liye he
 The important question is how the militants attacked the army base camp
 agar bharat aatankwaad ke prati zero tolerance kii niti par chalata he to pathankot ke baad sena ke thikaane par hamalaa kaise ho gaya
 Why is this question being left out? hamaare sainya karrwai ke mahanideshak yani dijiemo lefnitant general ranbir singh ne bataaya he ki uri main search aaparishan puraa ho gaya he
 Four AK 47 rifles, four under-barrel grenade launchers, 39 under-barrel grenades, 5 hand grenades, two radio sets, two GPS, two map sheets, two matrix sheets were recovered from the terrorists

 China has also said that it is against all forms of terrorism

 At times, these suggestions suggest that the government did nothing after the Pathankot attack in January this year
 abhi haal main china main ji-20 sammelan main duniya ke tamaam bade netaaon ke bich pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki dakshin asia main sirf ek desh he jo aatankwaad failaa rahaa
 Those who are spreading this epidemic should be banned, they should be isolated and not honored

 His constant statements about cross-border terrorism keep coming
 2015 main raksha mantri kaa ek bayaan he ki 2014 kii tulana main is baar 65 se 70 fisadi adhik aatankwaadi maare gaye hai

 Russia has canceled a joint military exercise with Pakistan
 china ne bhi kaha he ki vah har tarah ke aatankwaad ke khilaaf he
 The United States and Britain have also condemned, but can the condemnation be called a mobilization against Pakistan
 ninda to har baar hoti he
 The US who killed Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil needs to tell us something new about Pakistan, which has recently submitted documents related to the Pathankot attack to India
 pakistan ke raksha mantri khwaja asif ne kaha he ki hamaari dharti par koi kadam rakhega to ham gurez nahin karenge newclear vepans istamaal karne main
