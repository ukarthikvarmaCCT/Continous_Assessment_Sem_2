 The violence between ABVP and AISA at Ramjas College, Delhi University and the subsequent treatment of Gurmehar Kaur, a student of Lady Shri Ram College, has been termed as shameful by former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee
 unhone is maamle main bijepi saansadon ke bayaan kii bhi ninda kii he
 What happened in DU and JNU in the eyes of Soli Sorabjee, the well-known lawyer and constitution expert of the country, should review the action of the accused, not the existing law to decide treason
 psorabji ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha, 'supreme court ne haal hi main deshadroh ko lekar jo faisla diya he, vah apane aap main kaaphi kuch kahata he
 Therefore, before taking any action or making a statement in this regard, the prosecutors must read that order of the Supreme Court
 ' iske saath hi unhone kaha ki agar deshadroh kii dhara yani 124-e ko zyada spasht karne ke liye phir se paribhaashit karne kii jarurat bhi pade to ye faisla apane aap main kaaphi ahm he

 lekin haa, koi bharat murdaabaad yaa bharat mata murdaabaad ke naare lagaae us pararashtradrohaka aarope ho saktaa he, kyonki ye desh kii samprabhutaa ko chunauti dene jaisaa he
 It is treason to raise voice to incite violence against the sovereignty or democratic power of the country

 Condemning the statement of BJP mps in Gurmeharmalle, Soli Sorabji said that people who say such things do not have the moral right to be mps
 party ko unke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 The issues that are being talked about for treason are the Miss Application of Law

 Showing other faces is also part of democracy

 On the other side of Vadra, the controversy has given opportunity to Robert Vadra, the husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, to taste Kejriwal's own pudding
 wadra ne kaha ki log ab sahi or galat dekh chuke hai
 According to him, 'it is very important to be proof before accusing anyone
 jo mere saath hua he wo bilkul galat hua he
 On Facebook, on this issue, Vadra posted a message on Facebook on this issue

 It is interesting that they are being accused only by those close to them - such close people who say that whatever allegations are being made on Kejriwal are not the same but they also have concrete evidence

 kyonki aamtaur par bachche un logon par aisi media trial se aksar vichlit ho jate hai - jinase wo behad lagaav rakhte hai

 You will remember that Kejriwal had alleged in 2012 that real estate company DLF gave a loan of Rs 65 crore to Vadra without any guarantee and interest

 Jhansi: 'I came to the BJP during the most difficult time when there were two BJP mps
 jo bhayankar mehnat vaala daur tha us samay to mujhe aisa daudaya gaya gadhe kii tarah
 day and night
 
 day and night
 
 There should be any movement of BJP from 1984 to 2004, until a government was formed in Madhya Pradesh
 wo bhi ek andolan tha ki sarkaar banaakar dikhaao
 'union Minister Uma Bhartika's statement came at a time when the bypolls are going on in two seats just a few months before the final match of Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections
 uma ne ravivaar ko jhaansi main apane sadhe hue andaaj main party ke liye kaam karne kii ichha jari rakhi to vahiin yah bhi jataa diya ki unka mantralay badale jane se lekar aaj tak vah apni puraani hanak ke saath khud ko edjust nahin kar pain hai
 Before the commencement of elections in Madhya Pradesh, Uma, through her statement, has tried to show the party with her hard work that she is the warrior who brought the saffron revolution in the state of Madhya Pradesh
 so unhone isi bahaane madhya pradesh main sakriy hone ke liye yah bhi kah diya ki ve party ke liye campaner kii bhoomika main raheen hai
 Madhya Pradesh is her own state and she can campaign effectively here
 yah sanket mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa tension badhaane ke liye kaaphi he
 Actually, Uma Bharti is known as a fast-paced BJP leader, but last year the Prime Minister changed his cabinet and took away Uma Bharti's most important Ganga cleaning and river development ministry
 pehle unase istipha liye jane kii khabaren thim, lekin baad main unka mantralay badal diya gaya or unhen peyajal mantralay kii jimmedaari de di gai
 After this change, Uma also appeared to be somewhat unhappy
 phir bhi unhone khulkar sarkaar ke khilaaf koi bayaan nahin diya, lekin ab uma ke tevar badal rahe hai or vah party ke prati apane yogadan ko ginaakar dabaav banane kii koshish main hai
 In Jhansi, Uma Bharti openly reiterated her struggle among journalists on the lines of being active in the politics of Madhya Pradesh, saying that for the longest time, the BJP has made them the biggest to uproot the frozen roots of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh Was entrusted with the responsibility
 unase kaha gaya ki jaao tum madhya pradesh main sarkaar banaakar dikhaao
 It was impossible to form a government there
 yah unke liye ek andolan jaisaa hi tha
 In this, the Congress was thrown out of power
 yahaan unhone kai kaary kiye hai
 The BJP government is still here today and this time again she wants to work as a star campaigner in Madhya Pradesh, but she will not become the face of CM
 sirf party ke liye hi kaary karengi
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan does not want to interfere with Uma Bharti in Madhya Pradesh under any circumstances
 shivaraj jaanate hai ki yadi uma bharti ko party kii ore se power line mili to vah yahaan apana prabhaav dobaaraa jamaane se nahin chukengin
 This can be dangerous for them
 yahi kaaran he ki bundelkhand main hi do siton kolaras or mugawali main chal rahe upachunaav main prachaar ke liye shivaraj singh ne puri takat jhonkne ke baad bhi uma bharti ko yahaan prachaar karne kaa nyauta nahin diya he
 Whereas, here Lodh voters are also able to influence defeat to some extent and Uma Bharti's influence on Lodh voters
 iske pehle ken betwa link pariyojna par madhya pradesh sarkaar kii ore se enosi nahin die jane par uma bharti or shivaraj singh chouhan ke bich matbhed saamne aae the
 Later it was also said on behalf of Uma that he has stopped talking to Shivraj
 iske saath hi hal hi main uma bharti ne bundelkhand ke chhatarpur main apane pravachan ke 50 saal or diksha ke 25 saal kaarykram main ram janm bhoomi nyaas ke adhyaksh nrity gopaldaas ko bulaakar kaaphi bheed jutai thi
 Shivraj is trying to create a second Lodh leader than Uma Shivraj Singh Chauhan has made his MLA Bhai Jalam Singh, MLA from Damoh MP Prahlad Patel, in the recent cabinet expansion
 aisa isliye kiya gaya kyonki prahlada patel lodh samaaj se aate hai or unka apane ilaake main prabhaav bhi he
 Lodh is in a decisive position in many seats and if Uma Bharti decides to weaken Shivraj, it could be a tough time for the BJP
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar shivaraj singh bhi apni kursi ko majboot rakhane ke liye siyaasi or jaateey pattey phent rahe hai
 Uma told himself as MP, Pasa, as a minister, Pasuma Bharti has openly admitted that he is not happy with his tenure as an MP
 iske liye unhone apane swasthya ko vajah bataaya he
 Uma said, 'I am not at all satisfied with the status of an MP
 swasthya thik nahin rahane ke kaaran main pehle hi chunaav nahin laduya chaahati thi, lekin baad main mujhe jhaansi se ladaa diya gaya
 The people here owe that they never complained to me, but i am not satisfied with my own work
 haa mantri ke rup main safal raheen hum

 Anna Hazare met Uttarakhand Chief Minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri and congratulated him for passing the Lokayukta Bill by his state assembly
 hajaare ne kaha ki yah desh ke lihaaj se kaaphi acha kaam hua he or anya rajyon main bhi aisa hi vidheyak bananaa chaiye
 On the other hand, when asked about the possibility of passing such a bill in other states ruled by his party, Khanduri said in his cautious response that do not link this issue with politics

 'he said,' The people of the country hope that those whom they choose and send, do good work for them
 jo kaam khanduri ne kiya he vah desh ko nayi disha dene vaala he
 The central government should also follow similar legislation in many states of the country
 ham chaahate hai ki uttarakhand dwaara paarit vidheyak har rajya main paarit ho
 Hazare said, "after the passage of this bill in Uttarakhand, it is now believed that it will act like a 'headmaster'
" ’ kya vah sidhe taur par bhaajapa kaa samarthan nahin kar rahe, is par hazaare ne kaha, ‘main vyakti ke taur par khanduri kii tarif kar rahaa hum
 If other states also enact a similar bill, i will respect the Chief Ministers there as well

 Even if the weather is a villain, India is also expected to have bad weather during the final match

 The reason for this is the performance of Team India so far

 sarvocch nyaayalay ne kendriya vitt mantri pi
 Giving great relief to Chidambaram, on Friday, Janata Party President Subrahmanyam Swamy dismissed the petition
 is yachika main chidambaram ko 2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale ke aaropee purv kendriya sanchaar mantri e
 There was a demand to make co-accused with the king
 nyaayamurti jies singhvi or nyaayamurti esake radhakrishnan kii khandpeeth ne swami kii yachika khaarij karte hue kaha, "yachikakarta dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye tathyon se yah sabit nahin hota ki pi
 Chidambaram misused his office as finance minister or conspired or allocated spectrum in 2008 at a fixed rate in 2001
 raja ke saath unki mileebhagat thi
 " adaalat ne kaha ki pesh kii gai saamagree ke aadhaar pratham drushtya is nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa ki chidambaram ne do companiyon swaan or unitech ke share ko halkaa karne kii anumati jaanboojhkar di
 In delivering the verdict, Justice Radhakrishnan said, "no such facts have been provided which can be prima facie concluded that P
W
 chidambaram ne apane pad kaa durupyog kiya yaa swayan ko yaa e
 Have adopted some corrupt or illegal way to provide financial benefits to any other person including the king
 " After this decision of the court, Congress called Chidambaram clean and condemned Swamy
 lekin vipaksh ne congress ko aagaah kiya ki use is faisle se bahut khush nahin hona chahie, kyonki uske netritv vaali centre kii sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar aakanth bhrashtachar main dubi hui he
 Swamy had challenged the February 4 order of the lower court in the Supreme Court
 nichali adaalat ne apane aadesh main chidambaram ko sahaaaropee banane or unke khilaaf kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) se jaanch karaane kii maang khaarij kar di thi
 The court said that only one meeting between Chidambaram and Raja cannot be seen as a conspiracy
 is baat ko darshane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he ki chidambaram ne do mobile phone operataron ko koi aarthik laabh pahunchane ke liye unhen apni hissedari kam karne kii anumati di thi
 While dismissing the petition filed by Swamy and an NGO Center for Public Interest and Litigation (CPIL), the court said that no irregularities have been proved against the Union Finance Minister
 nyaayalay ke is faisle ke baad congress ne apni prakriya main kaha ki chidambaram kaa is maamle se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office V
 narayansami ne swami kii yachika khaarij hone ke baad kaha, "ham yah baat shuru se hi kah rahe hai
 No irregularities have been done on behalf of Chidambaram
 " Narayanasamy said, “everyone knows that Subrahmanyam Swamy is filing a petition against everyone in the Congress
 ham kanoonee or raajnneetik rup se unka muqabla karenge
 The conspiracy that Swamy accused is utterly wrong
 " Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni has also condemned Swamy
 unhone kaha, "hamane hameshaa se kaha he ki unka yah kadam auchitypurna nahin he
 "he said that Swamy had filed this petition to remain in the news
 soni ne kaha, "yah yachika daayar karne kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 It was just to waste the court's time
 " lekin swami ne kaha he ki vah is maamle main punarvichaar yachika daayar karenge
 On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) have said in their response that the Congress should not be too happy with the plea seeking to make Chidambaram a co-accused in the 2G case
 bhaajapa netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne swami kii yachika khaarij hone ke thode hi samay baad kaha, "maine puraa faisla nahin dekha he, lekin sarkaar ko ise lekar itnaa khush nahin hona chahie
 " nakvi ne kaha, "sarkaar kaa ek mantri pehle se jail main he or anya mantriyon ke khilaaf bhi saboot hai
 If a decision has come due to any technical reason or due to lack of evidence, then the government should not celebrate it, because this fact is steeped in corruption
 " CPI leader and Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) member investigating the 2G spectrum case Gurudas Dasgupta also said that this is not a victory for the government
 dasgupta ne kaha, "sarvocch nyaayalay faisla sunaane main apni jagah sahi he
 But mps and jpcs have their own viewpoints
 sibiai yaa sarvocch nyaayalay ne kya kaha he, iskaa hamaare upar koi asar nahin padane vaala he
 "comments dasgupta ne kaha, "ham praapt sabooton ke aadhaar par apana nirnay lenge
 This is not a shock
 " The allegations against Chidambaram date back to the time when he was the Union Finance Minister during the first term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
 lekin sarvocch nyaayalay ne in aaropon ko asweekaar kar diya
 a division bench of Justice GS Singhvi and Justice SK Radhakrishnan dismissed Swamy's plea, stating, "the facts provided by the petitioner do not prove that P
W
 chidambaram ne vitt mantri ke rup main apane pad kaa durupyog kiya yaa sajeesh kii yaa 2001 main tay dar par 2008 main spectrum ke aavanton main e
 He had collusion with the king
 " The court said that prima facie on the basis of the material presented, it cannot be concluded that Chidambaram deliberately gave permission to dilute the shares of the two companies, Swan and Unitech
 faisla sunaate hue nyaayamurti radhakrishnan ne kaha, "koi aisa tathy bhi uplabdh nahin karaayaa gaya jiskaa pratham drushtya nishkarsh nikaala ja sake ki pi
 Chidambaram misused his position or himself or a
 raja sahit kisi anya vyakti ko aarthik laabh dilaane ke liye koi bhrasht yaa avaidh tarika apanaaya ho
 " nyaayalay ke is faisle ke baad congress ne chidambaram ko paak-saaf bataaya or swami kii ninda kii
 But the opposition warned the Congress that it should not be too happy with the decision, as the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government headed by it is steeped in corruption
 swami ne nichali adaalat ke chaar farvari ke aadesh ko sarvocch nyaayalay main chunauti di thi
 The lower court, in its order, rejected the demand to make Chidambaram a co-accused and a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki chidambaram or raja ke bich hui keval ek mulaakaat ko sajeesh ke rup main nahin dekha ja saktaa
 There is nothing to show that Chidambaram allowed the two mobile phone operators to reduce their stake to provide any monetary benefit
 swami or ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan centre for public interest and litigeshan (sipiiel) kii ore se daayar yachika ko khaarij karte hue nyaayalay ne kaha ki kendriya vitt mantri ke khilaaf koi aniyamitata sabit nahin hui he
 After this decision of the court, the Congress said in its process that Chidambaram has nothing to do with this case
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajya mantri ve
 Narayanasamy said after Swamy's plea was rejected, "we have been saying this from the beginning
 chidambaram kii taraf se koi aniyamitata nahin kii gai he
 " narayansami ne kaha, "har koi jaanata he ki subrahmanyam swami congress main har kisi ke khilaaf yachika daayar kar rahe hai
 We will fight them legally and politically
 swami ne jis sajeesh kaa aarope lagaaya vah saraasar galat he
 " kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri ambika soni ne bhi swami kii ninda kii he
 He said, "we have always said that his move is not justified
 " unhone kaha ki swami ne yah yachika khabaron main bane rahane ke liye daayar kii thi
 Soni said, "there was no basis for filing this petition
 yah maatr nyaayalay kaa samay barbaad karnaa tha
 "but Swamy has said that he will file a review petition in this case
 duusari ore, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or bhartiya communist party (bhakpa) ne apni pratikriya main kaha he ki 2ji maamle main chidambaram ko sah-aaropee banane kii maang karne vaali yachika khaarij ho jane se congress ko bahut khush nahin hona chahie
 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said shortly after Swamy's petition was rejected, "I have not seen the full verdict, but the government should not be so happy about it
" " Naqvi said, "A government minister is already in jail and there is evidence against other ministers as well
 yadi kisi takneekee kaaran se yaa saboot ke abhaav main koi nirnay aayaa he, to sarkaar ko iskaa jashn nahin manaanaa chahie, kyonki yah aakanth bhrashtachar main dubi hui he
 " bhakpa netaa or 2ji spectrum maamle kii jaanch kar rahi sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke sadsy gurudas dasgupta ne bhi kaha ki yah sarkaar kii koi jeet nahin he
 Dasgupta said, "the Supreme Court is right in its place in delivering the verdict
 lekin saansadon or jepisi ke apane drushtikon hai
 What the CBI or the Supreme Court has said is not going to affect us
 "tippaniyan Dasgupta said, "we will make our decision based on the evidence obtained
 yah koi jhatka nahin he
 " chidambaram ke khilaaf ye aarope us samay ke hai, jab vah sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ke pratham kaarykaal ke dauraan kendriya vitt mantri the
 But the Supreme Court denied these allegations
 adaalat ne kaha ki pesh kii gai saamagree ke aadhaar pratham drushtya is nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa ki chidambaram ne do companiyon swaan or unitech ke share ko halkaa karne kii anumati jaanboojhkar di

 The Vedas and Puranas refer to Lord Vishnu as the follower of Shrishti
 maanav jivan se jude sukh-dukh kaa chakra shri hari ke haathon main he
 The recitation of Vishnu Sahasranama is very important in the worship of God
 is stotra main lakshmipathi ke ek hajaar naam die hai
 If you cannot read these sources every day, then know the mantra that gives fruits of thousands of names of Vishnu
 
 
 is mantra se milegaa vishnu sahasranam strotra kaa laabh:'namo stvan anantay sahastra moortaye, sahastrapadakshi shiroru bahve
 Sahastra Namne Purushaya Shashwate, Sahastrakoti Yuga Dharine Namah
 
 'it is a verse, which has the same effect as Vishnu Sahasranama Strota
 roj subah is ekmantraka jaap karne se jivan main aane vaali kathinaaiyon se mukti milti he
 What is the story related to Vishnu Sahasranama: One thousand names of Lord Vishnu are mentioned in the 'anushan Parva' chapter of the epic Mahabharata
 kaha jaataa he ki jab bhishma pitamah baanon kii shayya par lete apni ichha mrityu ke liye sahi samay kaa intjaar kar rahe the, tab unhone ye ek hajaar naam yudhisthir ko bataae the
 With a desire to gain knowledge, when Yudhishthira asked Bhishmapitamah, who is the one who is all-pervading and all-powerful? So Pitamah had told these one thousand names of Lord Vishnu
 vishnu sahasranam se hone vaale laabh:bhishmapitamah ne vishnu ke ek hajaar naam bataane ke saath hi yudhisthir se kaha ki har yug main manokamana purti ke liye, in ek hajaar naamon ko sunanaa or padhanaa sabase uttam hoga
 One can get rid of every crisis by reciting it regularly
 vishnu sahasranam kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki yah hindu dharm ke do pramukh sampradaay shaiva or vaishnavon ke bich yah judaav kaa kaam karata he
 Vishnu is called by Shambhu, Shiva, Ishaan and Rudra in the Vishnu Sahasranama, proving that Shiva and Vishnu are one
 sanathan sampradaay main dharm ko kabhi bhi maanav samaaj ke rup main nahin bataaya gaya he
 In the true sense, religion has been described as the law of duty of man, which we also call karma
 vishnu sahasranam bhi karm pradhan he
 Human religion is told in these one thousand names of Vishnu
 manushya dwaara maansik or shaareerik rup se hone vaale sabhi kaam or unke falon kaa varnan he
 For example, in the Sahasranama, the 135th name is 'dharmadhyaksha'
 iskaa matlab he ki karm ke anusaar insaan ko puraskaar yaa dand dene vaale dev

 The Central Government has claimed that through the proposals in the bill introduced in Parliament, there has been an effort to provide extra security to the customers as well as bring more transparency in the banking sector

 The Central Government has denied these misconceptions, saying that the FRDI bill introduced in Lok Sabha on 11 August 2017 is currently under consideration by the Joint Committee of Parliament
 vahiin joint samiti is bill par sabhi hitdharakon se raay lene kaa kaam kar rahi he jisase bainkon ke swasth or bank graahakon ke suraksha mandandon ko adhik majboot kiya ja sake

 On the other hand, deposits above Rs 1 lakh are not given any security and are considered equivalent to the claims of the unsecured lender

 — Ministry of Finance (@finminindia)december 7, 2017the FRDI Bill does not propose in any way to limit the scope of powers for the Government to extend financing and resolution support to banks, including public sector banks
 Government's implicit guarantee for public sector banks remains unaffected
 — Ministry of Finance (@finminindia)december 7, 2017besides providing similar protection / guarantee of Rs
 1 lakh to depositors, as it exists today, the rights of uninsured depositors are being placed at an elevated status in the FRDI bill compared to existing legal arrangements over the unsecured creditors and even government dues
 — Ministry of Finance (@finminindia)december 7, 2017the FRDI Bill is far more depositor friendly than many other jurisdictions, which provide for statutory bail-in, where consent of creditors / depositors is not required for bail-in

 The floods caused havoc
 In one round, the farmers of Wayanad were considered very happy, but the huge flood in 2018 broke their back

 Amid speculation of differences among senior players of Team India, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has spoken to the media and has kept his speech with great clarity
 bharat-australia vanade match se ek din pehle mahendra singh dhoni ne press conference main kaha ki team india main koi daraar nahin he
 He said that the team will play the match in complete unison
 dhoni ne team kii kamajoriyon kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki jeet ke liye ballebaaji main behatari lani hogi

 The unexpected presence of former Union Social Welfare Minister Balwant Singh Ramuwalia among the five new ministers inducted into Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet on October 31 in Lucknow is a major setback for the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab
 aisa lagata he ki bas yahi kasar baaki thi
 For the party, it came as a disaster in bad times, when Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal are working to stop the growing discontent and disturbance in the state
 ramuwalia kaa akali dal se janaa bhale hi unhen party ke bheetar darkinar kiye jane se nijee hataasha kaa nateeja ho, lekin rajya main pehle se chale aa rahe kisaan or dharmaparayan sikhon ke ugr pradarshnon ke bich isane aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya he
 With this, Badal's hold in his stronghold has suddenly started to loosen
 punjab kii sadakon par pichley maheene bhar se failaa najaara assi ke dashak kii vaapasi kii aahat de rahaa he
 Thousands of Sikh protesters chanting slogans and jamming the highways, sporadic incidents of continuous violence, posters or banners of Khalistan emerging suddenly amidst the demonstrations, the flag march of police and armed paramilitary forces all looked the same is
 rajya main is tanaav kaa silsilaa 7aktubar ko shuru hua jab is mausam main kapaas kii fasal ko tiddiyon se hue nuksaan kii bharpai karne main naakaam rahi sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraaz kisaan sadakon par utar aae
 It was alleged that fake pesticides were supplied to cotton growers in connivance with politicians and corrupt officials
 dhire-dhire kisaanon kaa pradarshan to tham gaya lekin yah thodi-si mohalat hi sabit hua
 Suddenly, on October 12, a news spread of insulting Guru Granth Sahib in Bargadi village of Faridkot district and then long-simmering discontent hit the streets
 sikh pavitra granth ko apamaanit kiye jane kii ghatana ko maaf karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Sikhs, who account for 60 per cent of Punjab's population, took to the streets in displeasure
 unka maananaa tha ki sattadhari shiromani akali dal or bhartiya janata party kii gathbandhan sarkaar doshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 Many protesters believed that the Akali leadership was responsible for this incident and a dozen similar incidents in other parts of Punjab
 naaraazgi bhadakaane main akaal takchat ke 24 sitambar ke vivaadaaspad hukumaname kii bhi bhoomika thi
 In this order, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the head of the Dera Sacha Sauda at Sirsa, was "forgiven" against whom the same Khata had declared a "social and religious boycott" in 2007
 deraa pramukh ke khilaaf yah aarope laga tha ki unhone sikhon ke dasven guru gobind singh kii nakal karne kii koshish kii thi jiske chalate unke khilaaf karrwai kii gai thi
 The decision to 'forgive' Ram Rahim was shocking to the Sikh community as it hurt his feelings deeply
 logon ke bich yah charchaa aam thi ki is hukumaname ke peeche sukhbir badal kaa haath he, jo ek 'saudebaaji' kaa hissaa he, taaki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main deraa kaa samarthan party ko mil sake
 Akal Takht, however, withdrew the pardon given to the Dera chief on 16 October due to heavy public pressure
 pradarshnakariyon main kai logon ko yakeen he ki granth sahib ko apamaanit karne kii ghatnaayen raajnneeti se prerit hai
 This resentment and demonstrations are also being fueled by separatist Sikh factions
 iskaa netritv panthprit singh, ranjit singh dhadriyanvaale or daler singh kheriwale jaise kuch sikh upadeshak kar rahe hai jinhen ab tak koi nahin jaanata tha
 These demonstrations are demanding not only the removal of the big glands and the heads of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee but they also aim to subvert the power of the Badal family
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki baar-baar pradarshnon ke bhadakne se ye sanket ekadam spashtï ho gaye hai ki apane shashan ke nauven saal main pahunch kar shiromani akali dal ke bheetar netritv kaa baari sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 Pramod Kumar, director and political commentator at Chandigarh's Institute for Development and Communication, calls these demonstrations the result of public frustration
 ve kehete hai ki iskaa zyada lenaa-dena janata ke bich ban chuki us dharna se he ki rajya ke sattadhari tabake ne—is maamle main badal parivaar or unke vafaadaar—rajnatik satta se lekar dhan-sampada or yahaan tak ki sikh dharmik sansthaanon par bhi kabja jamaa liya he
 Pramod Kumar says people's distrust of the ruling class has made it easy for the marginalized and radical Sikh groups and peasant organizations to turn this anger against the government so far
 ve kehete hai, ''log in samoohon main apane sarokaar dekhte hai
 Former Punjab police chief KPS Gill also believes that "social, political and economic mismanagement and corruption" is at the heart of such violent incidents of inter-state violence
 gil kehete hai ki badal raaj main akali dal ne ''kattarta ko badhaane or aasthaa ke raajnneetikaran ke vatavaran ko janm dene'' main yogadan kiya he
 Alarmed by the poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections and the Narendra Modi-led bjp's attempts to increase its influence in Punjab, the Akali Dal leadership once again abandoned its much-hyped "good governance and development" agenda and started playing the religious card
 is silsile main akali dal ne kareeb darjan bhar aatankwaadiyon samet kaid khalistaani aatankwaadiyon jaise devinder paal singh bhullar or balavant rajoana kii faansee kii sajaa maaf karne jaise kattar agenda ko hathiyaane kii koshish kii, jis par sawaal bhi khub uthe
 By raising the demand for Chandigarh to be the capital of Punjab alone, he brought the Anandpur Sahib manifesto alive in a way which is believed to have sparked the Khalistan movement
 pramod kumaar kehete hai, ''badal parivaar ne dharmik pratikwaad kaa sahaara lekar or kattarpanthi samoohon ke prati naram rukh akhriyaar karke apane paramparaagat va dharmaparayan sikh samarthakon ke saath dobaaraa rishte banane kii khub koshish kii
 "it seems that his initiative has gone the wrong way
" akali dal ke ek bade netaa sweekaar karte hai, ''aisa pehali baar hua he ki sikhon kaa ek bada tabaka party ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 He suspects that this may have an impact on the party's performance in the 2017 assembly elections
 is samooche daur main sukhbir badal ke chehre par havaaiyaan udati rahi hai or ve lagaataar is sankat ko ''kanoon-vyavastha se judi asthaayee haalat'' qaraar dete rahe hai
 The Badal family, instead of finding a political solution to it, is trying to pacify discontent through superficial interventions
 bargaadi main guru granth sahab se chhedchhad kii ghatana kii jaanch mukhyamantri ne 1november ko sibiai ko die jane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Earlier, DGP Sumedh Saini was dismissed and a case was registered in the case of two people killed in police firing in Bahbal Kalan village of Faridkot on October 14, but this did not calm the anger of the protesters
 pramod kumaar chetavanee dete hai ki kattarpanthi samoohon ke khilaaf spasht paksh lene main badal sarkaar ke sankoch yaa aakshamata ke chalate unki sthiti or majboot ho sakati he or isse or gaharaa dhruvikaran janm le saktaa he jisase 1980 ke dashak vaale khalistaani aatankwaad jaisi sthitiyon ko badhaava mil saktaa he
 There are also clear signs of having a 'foreign hand' in the case, which suggests that a well-planned conspiracy has been hatched between Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and the migrant Sikhs by radical elements
 charampanthi pravasi sikhon dwaara soshal media par jari silsilewar vivaadaaspad post main aise tamaam video shaamil hai jisamen naaraaz pradarshnkaree khuleam sarkaar ko gaaliyaan de rahe hai, logon se sadak par utarane kaa aahvaan kar rahe hai yaa phir afvaah failaa rahe hai
 Punjab BJP leaders have been suspiciously quiet during this crisis
 kisi bhi rajnatik parinaam se khud ko dur rakhane ke chakkar main jaahir taur par unhone aisa kiya hoga, lekin 20 aktubar ko apni baithak main bijepi kii kor cameti ne doshiyon ke liye 'asaamaanya dand' kaa aahvaan karte hue ''samay par karrwai na karne main prashasan (padhein akali netritv) '' kii naakaami ko bhi rekhaankit kiya
 However, the opposition Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are vocal in this matter
 sthitiyon ke maddenjar kah sakate hai ki akali dal ko 2017 ke chunaavon main isaki keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 In the light of events such as boycott of senior party leaders and keeping them away from public programs, some analysts believe that these circumstances can lead to historical results and that the Badal clan's dominance in mainstream Sikh politics is always possible
 Come to an end
 akali dal or khaskar badal parivaar ke khilaaf sikhon ke bade varg main failata asantosh or bhadakti naaraazgi rajya main 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main party ke liye baari pad sakati he
 The Delhi High Court has dismissed the petition filed against the ood-even formula
 pradooshan rokane ke liye dilli sarkaar kii ore se 15 april se lagu kiye jane vaale is formule ko lekar hoicourt main janhit yachika daayar kii thi gai thi, jisamen isaki kamiyaan ginate hue is par roak lagane kii maang kii gai thi
 During the hearing of the case, the court said that the petition is premature and hence it cannot be heard
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki kareeb 37 pratishtpradooshandopahiyaa vaahanon se hota he isliye od-ivan formule main inako bhi shaamil kiya jaae
 Apart from this, the exemption given to women should also be abolished
 bataa den ki pehle charan main formule kii safalataa ke badadilli sarkaarne 15 april se ek baar phir od-ivan formula lagu karne kii yojana banaai he

 jabaki uttar korea ke videsh mantri ne america ke ravaiye ko gangster jaisaa bataaya he

 haalanki, unhone yah bhi kaha ki uttar korea ke khilaaf pratibandh tab tak barkaraar rahenge jab tak vah apane parmaanu hathiyaar kaarykram ko puri tarah se khatm nahin kar detaa
 At the same time, North Korea's Foreign Minister General Kim Yong Chol said on Saturday after meeting Pompeo that America's attitude during the talks was 'shocking and like gangsters'
 ' saath hi unhone kaha tha ki vaarta ke nattejey 'bahut hi chintajanak' rahe hai
 Let me tell you that Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un met in June
 mulaakaat ko behad acchhee bataate hue trump ne daawa kiya tha ki kim jong un parmaanu nirastrikaran par raji ho gaya he
 Even after the meeting of the two leaders, there is no such thing happening from Korea

 Political situation is once again in Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya janata party ne mahabuuba mufti sarkaar se apana samarthan waapas le liya, isi ke saath rajya main rajyapal shashan lagu ho gaya
 The support of PDP in Kashmir was becoming a constant hug for the Bharatiya Janata Party
 kashmir ke halaaton ko lekar lagaataar bijepi nishane par aa rahi thi, aise main bijepi ke saamne iske alaava koi chaara nahin bachataa tha
 Know what were the compulsions that caused the BJP to break its ties with PDP
 # sarkaar banane ke baad se hi pidipi ne algaavvaadiyon or patharbaajon kii taraf naram rukh apanaaya, jisane kai baar bijepi ko baikfoot par dhakela
 # The ceasefire was implemented due to PDP in Ramadan, but the situation in the ceasefire worsened from bad to worse
 mahabuuba mufti sijafire ko aage badhanaa chaahati thim lekin bijepi ke liye ye bilkul sambhav nahin lag rahaa tha
 # Mehbooba kept most of her focus on the Valley, in such a situation that there was constant discrimination against Jammu and Ladakh
 mahabuuba apana kila to majboot kar rahi thim, lekin bijepi lagaataar apane ilaake main pichhadati ja rahi thi
 # Mehbooba Mufti has forgiven hundreds of stone-pelters in the last three years, they also withdrew firs from several stone-pelters
 isse ulat sena ke javaanon par kai baar exiaar hui jisase desh main bijepi ke liye galat massej gaya
 # After the Kathua scandal, when the questions were raised on the government, the ministers of BJP quota had to leave the government
 # mahabuuba chaahati thim ki kashmir main shanti ke liye pakistan or algaavvaadiyon se baatcheet ho
 But the BJP did not want to give such a message that it is bowing to the separatists
 # 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhartiya janata party ek baar phir ye sandesh dena chaahati he ki vah abhi bhi aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf sakht he
 For this it was necessary to quit the PDP
 aapako bataa den ki mangalvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne jammu-kashmir bijepi netaaon ke saath baithak kii thi, jiske baad bijepi ne apana samarthan waapas lene kaa elaan kiya tha

 He said that the Prime Minister, Amit Shah, the state leadership have spoken to everyone in this regard
 sarkaar girane ke baad bijepi ne jammu kashmir main rajyapal shashan lagaae jane kii maang kii thi
 'our agenda was fulfilled' After resigning from the post of Chief Minister, Mehbooba Mufti said that the policy of fear will not work in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki donon partiyaan alag-alag vichaardhaara ko maanati hai, lekin phir bhi satta ke liye nahin balki bade vijan ko saath lekar hamane BJP ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha
 Mehbooba said that through the government, she has been successful in implementing her agenda in Kashmir
 mahabuuba kaa kahana he ki kashmir ke logon se baatcheet honi chahie, pakistan se baatcheet honi chahie, ye unki hameshaa se koshish rahi he
 The Kashmir Valley is getting cold this year
 saal kii shuruyaat se hi ho rahi barfbaari or kadaake kii thand paryatakon ke liye bhi mushkilen paidaa kar rahi he
 As a result, the number of tourists visiting Kashmir has decreased
 kashmir ghati main barfbaari or thand kaa majaa lene ke liye desh-videsh se aane vaale paryatakon par bhi is saal kashmir main pad rahi jabardast thand kaa asar padane laga he
 With the start of the year, the way that winter in Kashmir has reduced, instead of increasing tourism
 paryaton se jude log bhi ab isse pareshaan hai
 Abdul Rahim, the Shikare, says, "tourists are not coming, the work is very little
 ’kashmir ghati main abhi tak din kaa taapmaana 10 degree se bhi neeche chal rahaa he, raat kaa taapmaana jiro degree ke aas paas hi bana hua he or philhal mausam vibhaag ke anusaar ek hafte tak mausam main koi sudhaar kii ummid bhi nahin he

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi held a road show for Congress candidate Ajay Rai in Varanasi on Saturday, the last day of campaigning for the final phase of the election Mahabharata
 unke is shakti pradarshan main bismilla khan ke beton kii shehanai kii dhun or 'raghupati raghav rajaraam' kii gunj bhi sunai di
 It is being said that Rahul's road show in Varanasi is the answer to Modi's rally in Amethi
 darasal, modi ne kuch din pehle amethi main chunavi sabha karke rahul gandhi ko kadi chunauti di thi
 It is believed that this is why Rahul is campaigning in Kashi, the BJP stronghold
 road sho ke liye rahul ke saath varanasi pahunche congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or raaj babbar ne kaha ki rahul ke samarthan main varanasi kii aam janata aaj sadakon par he
 Recently, a picture of Lord Ram was placed on the stage of a Modi rally in Faizabad, which was much debated
 aisi charchaa he ki congress ne usee kii kaat main aaj rahul ke road-sho ke dauraan 'raghupati raghav rajaraam' kii dhun kaa sahaara liya
 For this, a separate vehicle was arranged, which was running behind Rahul's vehicle
 kareeb das kilometre ke road sho main rahul gandhi ke saath gulam nabi aaazaad va raaj babbar samet kai congressi diggaj shaamil rahe
 During this time, flowers were also showered on Rahul
 rahul kaa road sho golgadda, pilikothi, vishweshwaraganj, maidagin, kabirchaura, piplani katra, lahurabir, chetganj, beniabag, nai sadak, goduliya, jangmbari, madanpura, bengali tolaa, sonarpura, bhadaini, assi hote hue lanka pahunchaa
 Reception gates were built throughout the route
 rahul gandhi ke road-sho me muslim matadaataaon ko rijhaane kii bharpoor koshish kii gai
 Perhaps that's why the road-show route was also decided through the Muslim-dominated area
 road-sho ke dauraan bismilla khan ke beton ne shehanai bhi bajaai or rahul gandhi ko bismilla khan kaa chitra bhi bhent kiya gaya
 Significantly, in his nomination, Narendra Modi also wanted to propose a member of Bismillah Khan's family, but this was not achieved after much effort
 bijepi ne uthaae sawalbijepi ne rahul gandhi ke rodsho par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley has raised the question that when Modi was not allowed the roadshow, then why was Rahul Gandhi allowed it? He asked the Election Commission if the roadshow was not allowed to Modi in Beniabagh, then why was it given to Rahul
 beniabag ilaake main lagu suraksha niyam kya sirf bijepi ke liye lagu hote hai or anya dalon ke liye nahin?vahiin bijepi netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne bhi rahul ke rodsho par karaara tanj ksaa
 He said that this is the Farewell show, not the roadshow of Congress
 modi sarkaar ko sabhi mantriyon ne apana-apana kaarybhaar sambhaal liya he
 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday that he will work with full force to create employment opportunities in the micro, small and medium sector as soon as he takes over the ministry
 gadakari ko emsamai mantralay ke saath sadak parivahan evam rajmarg mantralay kii bhi jimmedaari di gai he
 Even in the first term of the Modi government, this ministry was with Gadkari
 nitin gadakari ne apane awaas par patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki unhone agle dedh saal main har roj 40 kilometre sadak bichaane kaa ek nayaa lakshya rakhaa he
 On being given the new responsibility of the MSME ministry, Gadkari said, "this portfolio is related to the most important issues - economic growth and employment generation of the country"
 pradhanmantri kii ichha he ki is kshetra main rojgaar bade, jo ki abhi bahut kam he
 Employment generation should increase from this sector
 'nitin gadakari ne kaha ki main is pahalu par apni puri takat ke saath kaam karuunga
 We have decided to build public facilities on the roadside across the country
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, 'mujhe sadak parivahan par kaam karne kaa avasar mila
 This time i have decided to plant 125 crore trees along the roads in the next five years, as much as the country's population
 main bade paimaane par sadak ke kinare jan suvidhaayen sthapit karne par vichaar kar rahaa hum or aisi 2,000 suvidhaayen sthapit kii jaaengi
 Work on the mumbai-delhi Expressway has started and 12 other expressway projects will be completed in the next three months
 ' In Maharashtra, on Saturday morning, the BJP with the support of NCP Legislature Party leader Ajit Pawar succeeded in forming the government
 subah aath baje bhaajapa vidhayak dal ke netaa devendra fadanvis ne mukhyamantri or rakanpa netaa ajit pavaar ne upmukhyamantri ke rup main shapath lekar sabko chaunkaa diya
 Another major twist in the development came when party chief Sharad Pawar called it a personal decision of Ajit Pawar and said that it should not be considered as ncp's support
 is bich khabaron main kaha jane laga ki "chunki 30 oktober ko sarvasammati se ajit pavaar rakanpa vidhayak dal ke netaa chune gaye the, aise main unke samarthan ko rakanpa kaa samarthan mana ja saktaa he
 Legislators can be prosecuted under the anti-defection law if they go against the decision of the leader of the legislative party
 "lekin, supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta ise behad jatil vishay bataate hai
 He said that even after the formation of the government, the Governor and the Speaker of the Assembly will continue to play an important role
 maamla supreme court bhi ja saktaa he
 Gupta stated that “there are many aspects to this case
 raajnneetik dalon ko chunaav ayog dwaara manyata di jaati he
 The election symbol of the party is allotted to the assembly or Lok Sabha candidates as recommended by the party president
 chunaav jeetne ke baad party vidhayak dal ke netaa ko sadan main manyata milti he, jisase mukhyamantri yaa netaa vipaksh kaa chayan hota he
 The leader of the legislative party has the right to issue a whip and on whose violation an anti-defection law can be enforced
 "viraag gupta kehete hai, "maharashtra maamle main ajit pavaar bhale hi rakanpa vidhayak dal ke netaa hai, lekin sarkaar banane main samarthan ke liye party adhyaksh ke patr kaa hi vaidhanik mahatv he
 After this development, NCP mlas can also remove Ajit Pawar from the post of party leader by majority
 ajit pavaar yadi zyada vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa karke rakanpa ke hi mukhiya ban jaaen to is maamle main nayaa mode aa jayega
 "he said," The governor should also tell which mlas other than BJP have submitted letters of support to Devendra Fadnavis to form the government
 is puri prakriya main sarkaar banane main rajyapal kii bhoomika he, parantu vidhayakon kii dal badal kanoon ke tahat ayogyata ke bare main faisla vidhansabha adhyaksh dwaara hi liya jaataa he
 After the end of President's rule in Maharashtra, there are two legal procedures to be followed
 pehla nai vidhansabha kaa gathan or doosraa mukhyamantri dwaara vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye rajyapal dwaara unhen samay diya janaa
 "gupta said," If Sharad Pawar still has a majority of mlas in NCP, he can claim a counter-alliance with Congress and Shiv Sena
 aisi javaabi sthiti main maamla supreme court bhi pahunch saktaa he, jahaan shivasena ne pehle yachika daayar kii thi
 According to the precedent of the old decisions, if a hearing is held in the Supreme Court, then it can be directed to prove majority on the floor of the Assembly itself
 "khabaron ke anusaar, ensipi ke vidhayakon ne blank samarthan patr ajit pavaar ko diya tha, jisamen mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin likhaa tha
 The formation of the new government by Ajit Pawar can be challenged by the concerned legislators on the basis of this letter of support that his letter of support was fraudulently taken
 mahatvapurn sawaal yah he ki vidhansabha ke gathan ke pehle kya vidhayakon ke upar dal badal virdohi kanoon ke tahat karrwai kii ja sakati he? Campaigning for Haryana Legislative Assembly Election: BJP is stating section 370, the biggest electoral issue, making the functioning of Congress Khattar government, Bharatiya Janata Party National President Amit Shah has started campaigning for assembly elections in Haryana
 kaithal se chunavi hunkaar bharte hue shah ne haryana main is baar 75 se zyada siton par jeet ke saath sarkaar kii vaapasi kaa daawa kiya
 With these claims of victory, Amit Shah's speech dominated national issues like Kashmir, Pulwama, Balakot and triple talaq
 ye vahi mudde hai, jinhen haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter bhi pramukhataa se uthaa rahe hai
 On the other hand, when it comes to the Congress, the party is keeping Khattar's tenure at the forefront
 yani khatter jahaan centre sarkaar or modi ke naam par chunaav lard rahe hai, vahiin congress khatter ke kaam ko apana pramukh agenda bana rahi he
 Khattar told Section 370 the biggest election issue Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had recently talked about on many issues in a special conversation with Aaj Tak
 is dauraan khatter ne bataaya tha ki jammu kashmir se dhara 370 khatm karnaa hi haryana ke chunaav main sabase bada mudda he
 bjp's candidates are also fully raising this agenda of Khattar
 adampur se bijepi pratyaashee or tiktaoc star sonaali phogot ne bhi ajtak ko die intervyuu main kaha he ki dhara 370 hataane kaa jo kaam congress kii sarkarein 70 saalon main nahin kar pai thim, wo modi sarkaar ne kar dikhaaya he
 That is, from bjp's national president Amit Shah to the head of state Manohar Lal Khattar and the candidates who have entered the electoral fray, all BJP leaders are raising national issues like Section 370 among the public
 khatter ke kaam par hooda kaa warcongress kii baat kii jaae party khatter sarkaar ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal ko pramukhataa se uthaa rahi he
 In his statements, prominent Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been continuously accusing the Khattar government of not keeping the promises made in the last 5 years
 hooda kaa kahana he ki khatter sarkaar ne kisaanon se lekar naujavaanon tak se jude jo chunavi vaade kiye the, un par vah puri tarah fail rahi he or vikaas main number van kahalaane vaala haryana aparaadh main number van ban gaya he
 Congress 'first report, then vote' campaign Not only this, Congress has also started a campaign named 'first report, then vote'
 yah campan bijepi sarkaar ko gherne ke liye shuru kiya gaya he, jiske makasad khatter sarkaar kii vifaltaaon ko ginanaa or janata ko yah bataanaa he ki wo sarkaar se puche usne kya kaam kiye hai or phir usee aadhaar par vot den
 It is clear from the statements and campaign of the leaders of both the parties that while the BJP is going ahead among the people by putting forward the works of the Modi government, the Congress is accusing the state government of failing and terming Khattar's tenure as a failure

 Another important difference, he says, is that students are connected to subject matter experts, not to generalists with knowledge of many subjects, so that they can get the best education in that subject

 The son has been running for about twenty days
 pravachan, satsang sab dukaane band padi hai
 The husband and son's actions could not escape themselves, but despite this, Asaram Bapu's wife appeared for the first time about three months after the husband's infamy
 saamne ai or wo bol gayi jise jisane bhi suna vahi chaunk uthaa
 Will you believe that Asaram Bapu, who is facing the charge of putting a bad eye on the wife and daughter of others, no longer accepts his wife Asaram as her husband? Believe it or not, Asaram's legal wife Lakshmi herself is admitting that Asaram is no longer her husband
 darasal, lakshmi kaa kahana he ki asaram ne shaadi ke saat saal baad hi brahmacharya kubul liya tha
 That is, after living together for seven years, Asaram suddenly made a physical distance from Lakshmi one day and then with the passage of time, Lakshmi accepted his decision
 wo asaram ko apane pati kii bajaay apana guru maanane lagi or ab lakshmi ne kaha he ki jab unke pati khud kai saalon se unase hi dur rahete hai, to phir wo kisi or ladki ke saath rishte kaise bana sakate hai yaa phir kisi ke saath balaatkaar kaise kar sakate hai?darasal, lakshmi ne apane pati asaram ke oficial website main apane pati or beti ke haq main apana jo intervyuu jari kiya he, usamen unhone kuch aisi hi baaten kahin hai
 In this interview, Lakshmi has defended Asaram, herself and her daughter, but in a surprising way, her son Narayan Sai is not mentioned anywhere in the entire interview, while Asaram and his wife and daughter are presently The kind of allegations that have surrounded him, son Narayan Sai is not only the same accusation, but he is constantly hiding from the police to escape
 vaise asaram kii website par ravivaar ko jari kiye gaye is intervyuu main beshak lakshmi ne pehali baar apana munh kholaa ho, unka puraa website in dinon dharm-karm or aadhyatm kii baton se kam, asaram or unke kunbe ke bachaav kii baton se hi zyaada ranga padaa he
 On one side, Lakshmi Sirumalani, Asaram's wife, who is now calling Asaram not her husband but a guru
 vajah de rahi hai ki asaram to kab ke brahmacharee ho chuke hai or duusari taraf asaram ke purv vaidya or sevadaar, jo kah rahe hai ki asaram to yon shakti vardhak dawaaen lete hai
 And that too not from today, but for years
 samaj main nahin aata, kise sachcha maane or kise jhootha kahen, kyonki agar asaram kii patni kii baton par yakeen karte hai, to asaram ke puraane vaidya or sevadaar kii baaten juthi ho jaati hai or agar vaidya or sevadaar kii baton ko sach maanate hai to asaram kii patni kii baaten galat ho jaati hai, lekin ye bhi sach he ki in donon main se koi to aisa jarur he, jo jhooth bol rahaa he, kyonki isi sach-jhooth kii khinchataan main asaram kii puri asaliyat chhipi he
 The question is that according to Lakshmi, if Asaram had become Brahmachari only after seven years of his marriage, then what would he do with sexual enhancing drugs? After all, why did they need such herbs for their energy and strength, which is usually needed by a householder or a fun-loving person? It is obvious that if both of these Asaram's old Khidmatgar are telling the truth, then the reality of sexual abuse and rape charges against them in the light of this truth can also be weighed
 vaise lakshmi sirf asaram kaa bachaav hi nahin kar rahi hai, balki asaram kii website par unhone apana jo video intervyuu aplod kiya he, usamen unhone khud par apni beti bharti par lage ilzaamon ko bhi jhootha qaraar diya he
 On being asked by Laxmi that the police say that she herself was upset with her husband Asaram, Laxmi gave it an unaccounted agreement
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main wo kahati hai ki kya koi patni or beti apane pati yaa pita ke liye ladakiyon kaa intazaam kar sakati he? thik isi tarah wo beti bharti ke haq main kahati hai ki bharti khud bahut sanyamvali zindagi jiti hai, wo bhatke hue logon ko sahi raste par laa rahi he, aise main bhala wo khud kaise aisi harkaton main shaamil ho sakati he?zaahir he, lakshmi puri takat se apana bachaav kar rahi hai, lekin police kii nigaah main asaram ke saath-saath khud lakshmi or bharti bhi kam gunahagaar nahin hai

 phir usee 2016 main usee ISI ne pathankot airbase par hamalaa kiya
 The Prime Minister called the same ISI in the Pathankot airbase and called it Baizjat
 ISI puure airbase ke nakshe banaakar le gaye
 Did it not threaten the security of the entire country? Making my video is a threat to the security of the country or the Prime Minister's call to the ISI and roaming in the airbase is a threat to the country's defense
 maan ne aage likhaa ki meraa aapse nivedan he ki aapako is cameti ke kaary kaa dayera badhanaa chahie
 This work of Prime Minister should also be brought under the purview of this committee
 mere saath-saath pradhanmantri ko bhi yah cameti saman kare
 If i am guilty, the Prime Minister is 100 times more guilty than me
 mujhe ummid he ki aap pakshpaat nahin karengi
 It is noteworthy that in the case of Bhagwant Mann putting videos of sensitive places of Parliament on social media, the Lok Sabha speaker has formed an inquiry committee
 loksabhaa spikar ne bhagwant maan ke karname ko sansad kii suraksha ke liye gambhir khatra mana he or isaki jaanch ke liye kirit somaiyya kii adhyakshata main nau sadasyeey cameti bana di
 The committee has to submit its report by 3 August which will be tabled in the House
 tab tak maan ko sansadeey kaarywahi main shaamil na hone kii salaah di gai he
 Talking to NDTV India, Bhagwant Mann said that people of my area tell me that if you did not raise our issue, i used to tell them that the issue in Parliament would have been decided by a lucky draw
 jaise kal 160 saansadon se apane sawaal shunya kaal ke liye jamaa karaaye to keval 20 saansad hi apane sawaal uthaa paaenge, lekin log maanate nahin the or kehete the ki sansad main kaisaa lucky drow?" maan ne kaha ki unka makasad sansad kii security dikhaanaa yaa usko khatre main daalana nahin tha
 He has written in the letter that- Yesterday you formed a committee to make my videos
 samiti jaanch karegi ki is video se sansad kii suraksha ko khatra to nahin paidaa hua? 2001 main ISI ne sansad par hamalaa kiya
 Then in the same 2016, the same ISI attacked the Pathankot airbase
 pradhanmantri ji ne usee ISI ko pathankot airbase main bizzat bulaakar ghumaya
 ISI drew maps of the entire airbase
 kya isse puure desh kii suraksha ko khatra nahin hua? meraa video bananaa desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra he yaa pradhanmantri ji kaa ISI ko bulaakar airbase main ghumana desh kii raksha ke liye khatra he
 Mann further wrote that i request you that you should increase the scope of work of this committee
 pradhanmantri ji ke is krit ko bhi is cameti ke kaary ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 This committee should summon me as well as the Prime Minister
 yadi main doshi to pradhanmantri ji mujhase 100 guna zyada doshi hai
 i hope you do not curry favor
 ullekhneey he ki sansad kii samvedansheel jagahon kaa video bhagwant maan dwaara soshal media par daalane ke maamle main loksabhaa spikar ne jaanch cameti bana di he
 The Lok Sabha speaker considered Bhagwant Mann's exploits as a serious threat to the security of Parliament and constituted a nine-member committee headed by Kirit Somaiya to investigate it
 cameti ko 3 agast tak apni report deni he jise sadan main rakhaa jayega
 Till then Mann has been advised not to attend parliamentary proceedings
 enditivi india se baat karte hue bhagwant maan ne kaha tha ki mere kshetra ke log mujhe kehete hai ki aap hamaara mudda nahin uthaate to main unako bataata tha ki sansad main mudda lucky drow se tay hota
 For example, if i submit my questions to 160 mps for zero hours tomorrow, only 20 mps will be able to raise their questions, but people did not agree and said what lucky draw in Parliament? ”mann said that his aim was to show the security of Parliament He was not to be endangered

 He also said that he has spoken to Arvind Kejriwal, who had said that BJP will not give tickets
 iske alaava udit raaj ne yah bhi bataaya tha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek baar sansad main unase kaha tha ki wo galat party main he
 If i had been told earlier, i would not have suffered so much

 uttar pradesh ke unnav jile main gangrape maamle main police kii badi laaparvaahee pehle hi saamne aa chuki he, idhar, gajiabad police ne bhi kuch aisa hi kiya
 Where the incident of rape of a blind girl was carried out
 or police ne is maamle main thik se peedita ke bayaan tak lene kii jahamat nahin uthaai
 When the matter reached the Child Welfare Committee, the whole matter came out openly
 police kii laaparvaahee ke chalatabalaatkaaraka aaropee shaks khulaa gum rahaa he
 Two days after the incident, the police registered an FIR
 hairaani kii baat he ki ladki sadak par do din tak badahavaas padi rahi lekin kisi ne uski madad nahin kii
 Then a man running a tea shop extended a helping hand
 yah sharmnaak maamla buudhvaar kaa he
 The girl lived with her father in Lajpat Nagar area of sahibabad
 mahaj 10 din pehle hi uske pita kii maut ho gai
 He did not have the money to pay to the landlord
 lihaaja makaan maalik ne use ghar se nikaal diya
 Seeing a lonely and blind girl, she was raped by a person from the area
 iske baad ladki ko sadak par phenk kar faraar ho gaya
 The victim girl kept crying on the road at Parshvanath Society near Mohan Nagar
 ladki ko sabane dekha, lekin kisi ne bhi uski madad nahin kii
 At the same time, when Subhash, who runs a tea shop called Modi Tea Stall, saw the girl, he came forward to help her
 subhash ne police or child welfare cameti ko phone kiya
 But the police started showing their careless attitude
 ladki ko thane le jaaya gaya, magar uskaa bayaan nahin liya gaya
 General Medical was done and handed over to the Child Welfare Committee
 beeti shaam child welfare cameti kii counselling main yah saaf hua ki ladki ke saath balaatkaar hua tha
 Then the report was sent to the police and the police registered an FIR
 matlab saaf he ki 2 din main netraheenaldaki ke saath balaatkaarakarne vaala aaropee faraar ho chukaa he
 Also giving him a chance to escape is the reckless UP police
 agar police ne pehle hi din ladki kaa bayaan lekar uskaa internal medical chekup kara liya hota, to shaayad 2 din pehle hi mukadmaa darj ho gaya hota
 And perhaps the accused would also have been caught by the police
 ajtak ke paas report kii copy bhi he, jisamen ladki ne apana bayaan diya he
 Now the girl's internal medical is also being done
 sirf police hi nahin, ensiaar main logon kii samvedanheenata bhi saamne ai he
 The girl lay on the road for 2 hours
 lekin kisi ne madad nahin kii
 If Chaiwala Subhash did not come forward to help her, then anything untoward could have happened
