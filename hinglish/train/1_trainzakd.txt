khaas baat yah he ki murali kii tarah herath par 'chakar' kaa koi tag bhi nahin laga he
 Murali may have been a 'wizard' of the spin but his playing skills in Australia were declared a no-ball due to the charge of chucking his balls, passing biometric tests and the 'javelin thrower' address of the legendary spinner like Bishan Singh Bedi
 There was a slight glow saubhaahgya se herath ko ection ekadam clin he
 The average and strike rate of this 38-year-old Sri Lankan bowler is amazing
 herath ne ab tak 75 test maichon main 27
 351 wickets at an average of 97 (economy rate 2
 76 )hasil kiye hai
 His strike rate is 60
 7 kaa he yani lagbhag har 61 gend main ve wicket lene main kaamyaab rahe hai

 gharelu maidan main jahaan unhone 41 test main 23
 He has taken 231 wickets at an average of 14 while in the 34 Tests played abroad, he has taken 120 wickets, including 24 wickets taken at the neutral venue
 videshi maidaanon main unka ausat 37 ke aasapaas kaa he
 Herath will soon become Sri Lanka's second most successful bowler
 tej gendbaaj chaminda vaas ke 355 test wicket ke record se ve mahaj chaar wicket hi peeche hai
 It has to be kept in mind that Vaas had taken these wickets in 111 Tests while Herath is just four wickets away from his record in only 75 Tests
 38 saal ke herath ne yadi aisa hi pradarshan jari rakhaa to apane viketon kaa aankada 400 ke paar pahunchaa sakate hai
 
 is 38 varshiya srilankai gendbaaj kaa ausat or strike rate kamaal kaa he
 Herath has made 27 of 75 Test matches so far

 76)
 unka strike rate 60
 He has managed to take wickets in almost every 61 balls

 The comments baayen haath ke leg spinner herath ko lagaataar kasi hui gendbaaji or lambey spel phenkane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Herath, who made his Test career debut in 1999, met the legendary Murali in his first match
 yahi nahin, australia ke khilaaf gaale main hue is test main unhone murali ke saath hi australian pari ko sametane main bhoomika nibhaai thi
 In this draw, Murali took five for 71 and Herath took four wickets for 97 runs

 He averages around 37 in foreign plains
 herath jald hi srilanka ke duusare sabase kaamyaab gendbaaj ban jaaenge

 If 38-year-old Herath continues his performance, the figure of his wickets can cross 400

 Brazil's claim of being the most successful FIFA World Cup so far is considered to be the biggest, there are many reasons - one of which is that Brazil is the host and will get the benefit of home ground and supporters, but in the world of football Italy The claim of the person is also never undermined
 italy ke naam chaar worldcup khitaabon ke alaava ek european championships or ek olympics khitaab hasil karne kaa bhi gaurav darj he
 But the Italian fans are not offering a big claim to their team because the team was eliminated in the first round in 2010 after winning the title in 2006
 pichhali dfa group stage main italy ne paragway or newzealand ke khilaaf muqabla drow khelaa or phir slovakia ne italy ko 3-2 se haraakar use round of sickstin main nahin pahunchane diya

 Chanting Azurri's mantra, its fans are seen playing the role of the 12th player in any stadium of the world
 is team ne chah baar final tak kaa safar kiya, ek baar tisare or ek baar chauthe sthaan par rahi
 The great thing is that after Brazil, the second most successful team in the world has shown its strength in qualifying and practice matches this time
 italy kii team maidan par supermodles se saji nazar aati he, or shaatir tareeke se vipakshiyon ko maat dene kaa shandaar namoona pesh kar rahi he
 Italian stars 4-3-3 ke formation se khilne vaali is team ko striker baloteli ke saath midfilder di rossi se badi ummiden hai
 Captain Buffon and midfielder Pirlo know the importance of lifting the trophy in the year 2006 and the whole team is slowly getting into rhythm
 italy kii khaasiyat It usually proves extremely difficult for any team to distinguish Italy's fortress playing defensively
 iske alaava italy ke golkeeper hameshaa se italy kii takat sabit hote rahe hai
 Italy's challenge italy kii sabase badi chunauti uske pichley worldcup main pehle hi round main baahar ho jane kaa dard he
 Italy may have to change its strategy early this time
 group of deth main hone kii vajah se italy ko shuru se hi chaukanna rahane kii zarurat hogi

 According to information received by Indian intelligence agencies, underworld don Dawood Ibrahim is living in Pakistan
 haalanki vah samay samay par apni lokation badalata rahata he
 India has sought information available from Pakistani authorities about Dawood Ibrahim
 saath hi daaud ke passport or surkhiyon main aae paak main uske vibhinn thikaanon ke bare main bhi poocha he
 The Indian government is constantly talking to Pakistan regarding this matter

 Many of his addresses were also shared with Pakistan
 is sambandh main kai baar pakistan ko bataaya ja chukaa he
 After the arrest of mafia Chhota Rajan, there were reports that Dawood's security in Pakistan has been increased
 iviem or vivipat ko lekar desh main pichley kaaphi samay se bahes jari he
 Meanwhile, the Election Commission has rejected the government's proposal, in which the government was advised to buy VVPAT machines from the private sector
 chunaav ayog ne sarkaar se kaha he ki agar aisa hota he to aam aadmi ke vishwaas ko thes pahonchegi
 According to the news of the English newspaper Indian Express, this disclosure was due to an RTI
 darasal, kanoon mantralay ne july-sitambar, 2016 main chunaav ayog ko teen chitthiyaan likhakar ye suzav diya tha
 Responding to which, on September 19, 2016, the Election Commission said that private manufacturers cannot be entrusted with this task
 gauratlab he ki us dauraan naseem zadi mukhya chunaav ayukta the
 Let me tell you that till now only two public sector units have been producing EVM and VVPAT in India
 bharat electronics limited bengalooru main or electranix korporation of india limited hyderabad main ye mashine taiyaar hoti hai
 Let us tell you that in 2013 the Supreme Court ordered the use of VVPAT in elections
 jiske baad chunaav ayog ne kaha tha ki vah 2019 loksabhaa chunaav tak vivipat kii vyavastha shuru kar denge
 The Election Commission rejected the government's suggestions by making these arguments
 
 
 # agar privet sector in mashiinon ko taiyaar karata he, to aam logon kaa vishwaas isamen kam hoga
 # VVPAT machines are checked in front of political parties before elections
 # kya privet company 14 saal ke liye vivipat mashin kii jimmedaari legi
 # It is not decided what type of security feature the private company uses in the machine
 # kya privet company BEL or ECIL kii tarah vivipat mashiinon kii suraksha kii guarantee le paaegi
 The regional issue seems to dominate in these elections in Jharkhand
 isi kaa nateeja he ki kai kshetreey muddon par nai partiyaan paidaa ho gai hai or loksabhaa kii zyada se zyada siton par chunaav bhi lard rahi hai
 This can increase the problems of national parties like Congress and BJP
 in partiyon ko jhamumo ke janaadhar main send lagane kii sambhaavnaaon ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (prajatantrik) Party of former Jharkhand Chief Minister Babulal Marandi is contesting all the 14 seats in the state
 isi tarah, mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (basapa) bhi sabhi siton par chunavi maidan main he
 So All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) is contesting in six Lok Sabha seats
 bihar kii do mukhya partiyon rajd or lojpa ke bich gathbandhan ne chunavi mukaable ko or adhik rochak bana diya he
 The RJD and LJP will contest six and five seats
 rajya main rajd kii maujuudagi bahut kam he, uske do hi saansad hai
 However, LJP is yet to open its account
 rajya main rajd ke bare main isi baat se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki uske chah ummidavaaron main se chaar to anya partiyon se aae hue hai
 JD (U) MLA Nagmani is contesting from Chatra, while Pranab Verma, who left the BJP and joined RJD, is a candidate from Koderma
 rajd kii jharkhand ikai ke adhyaksh gautam sagar rana kehete hai, ''rajd or lojpa gathbandhan rajya main apni maujuudagi darj karake dikhayega
 Our alliance will emerge as the strongest alliance in the state in the Lok Sabha elections
 '' jharkhand main rajd or lojpa ke gathbandhan ko daud main hissaa le rahe do viklangon ke gathbandhan kii sangya di ja rahi he
 At the same time, AJSU, which is called the party of youth, is also desperate to make its presence felt
 is baar yah 6 siton par chunaav lard rahi he jabaki pichhali baar yah sankhya 4 thi
 AJS has two mlas
 party ne jeemem ghuscand ke aaropee shailendra mahato ko maidan main utaara he
 Shailendra was earlier in the BJP and also won the 1998 and 1999 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin 2004 main unhen tikat nahin mili thi
 "how can people call AJSU a children's party," says Sudesh Mahato, president of AJSU and former home minister of Jharkhand

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar visited Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur on June 18 to take stock of preparations to deal with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)
 vahaan bal gahan chikitsa kaksh main bhartee sabhi bacchon ke mata-pita se unhone ek sawaal kiya, ''bachche ko khaanaa khilaayaa tha raat main?''nitish kumaar ne jinase bhi baat kii unamem se adhiktar mahilaon ne hichakate hue jawaab diya, ''bhukhle so gai thi
 "even more disappointing is that girls whose parents gave them empty stomachs or who did not get enough food at night had a higher number of girls
 aise main koi hairaani kii baat nahin ki aakhir kyon eies peediton kii suchi main ladakiyon kii sankhya ladakon kii tulana main bahut adhik he
 AES in Muzaffarpur killed 129 children, 85 of whom were girls
 eskeems ke ek doctor kehete hai, ''isse bihar ke pitrusattatmak samaaj kii anuchit praathamikta kii jhalak milti he jo balikaon kii dekhbhaal kam karata he
 This explains why Bihar's sex ratio is so bad? According to the 2011 census, Bihar has 918 females per 1,000 males, which is much lower than the national average of 940
 ''chikitsa visheshgy bhi is baat se sahamat hai ki khaali pet or eies se hone vaali mauton kaa sidhaa sambandh he

 prabhaat kumaar sinha bataate hai, ''subah ke samay main blad sugar kaa str aamtaur par bahut neeche chalaa jaataa he kyonki bhojan kiye kai ghante ho chuke hote hai
 It gets worse in the case of a malnourished child who falls asleep at night without eating
 isse aksar hypoglysemia kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 '' Dr
 sinha kehete hai, ''hamaare mastishk ko kaary karne ke liye khun main glucose ke saamaanya str kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 When the liver fails to meet this requirement, an alternative way of making glucose in our body, called fatty acid oxidation, opens
 lekin lichi main paaya jane vaala mithaylin cychloprople glysin (emsipiji) is vaikalpik maarg ko avaruddh karata he, jiske kaaran daure padate hai or kai maamalon main mrityu tak ho jaati he
 "actually, Bihar produces 40 per cent of the total litchi in the country and Muzaffarpur is quite famous for it
 lekin, lichi main main paaya jane vaala toxin kuposhit bacchon ko nuksaan pahunchaata he, kyonki unke khun main blad sugar kaa str kam hota he
 Most children who died in Muzaffarpur were found to have a 'high percentage' of hypoglycemia (deficiency of blood sugar)

 Nitish Kumar is known for his efforts to empower women by eradicating gender discrimination in the state
 unhone panchayat or sarkari naukariyon main mahilaon ke liye 50 pratishat siten arakshit karne se lekar mahilaon kii ichha ko puraa karte hue bihar main purna sharabbandi jaise kadam uthaae hai
 The Chief Minister has also taken several steps in the past for the welfare of girls
 inamen skool jane vaali ladakiyon ke liye muft kapade, kitaaben or cycle dene kii peshkash shaamil he, jisase skulon main namakan main baari oochaal ai thi
 It is being said that the Chief Minister has expressed his disappointment about discrimination against girls
 unhone aise 450 se adhik logon ke saamaajik-aarthik surveykshan kaa aadesh diya he, jinke bachche yaa to eies se prabhavit hai yaa phir is beemaari ke kaaran se unki jaan gai
 Following the instructions of the Chief Minister, the government has ordered a detailed survey to ascertain the status of the families affected by the AES
 yah surveykshan bihar sarkaar ke gramin aajeevika kaarykram jeevika ke karmchaaree karenge
 Livelihood workers have been asked to study the social behavior prevalent in the areas as well as ascertain the hygiene status of the areas where AES has been found
 mukhyamantri kaa nirdesh spasht he
 Says a senior officer in the CM Secretariat, "the Chief Minister first wants to know why girls in rural areas are not being taken care of at the same level as children are being looked after?" If the survey confirms our apprehensions, the government will use all its resources not only to ensure medical and economic well-being, but also to make rural society sensitive to girls
 '' surveykshan main bihar kii samekit bal vikaas sevaaon kaa moolyankan bhi kiya jayega, jo chah saal se kam umr ke bacchon ke liye poshan or swasthya pradaan karne kaa kaam karti he
 Dr
 sinha bataate hai ki eies zyaadaatar bacchon ke kendriya tantrika tantra ko prabhavit karata he or isaki shuruyaat tej bukhaar ke saath hoti he
 It then begins to disrupt neurological functions leading to brain shock, seizures, coma and death
 ve kehete hai, ''kuposhan, eies se maut ek pramukh kaaran ho saktaa he
 In contrast to well-nourished children, the liver of malnourished children has very little glycogen
 mastishk ko urja ke strot ke rup main glucose kii aavashyaktaa hoti he lekin kuposhit bacchon main bahut kam sugar hota he
 a sudden drop in glucose level leads to seizures and death
 '' eies se prabhavit pariwaron ke ek praarambhik akalan se pataa chalata he ki peediton main se adhiktar anusuchit jati or samaaj ke anya kamjor virgon ke hai or ve sabhi aarthik rup se vanchit samoohon main aate hai
 Most of the affected families are either illiterate or very rarely educated
 kai pariwaron ke kamau sadsy pravasi shramikon ke rup main kaam kar rahe hai
 The government's failure to detect the cause of AES is also a major medical obstacle
 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur main anseflitis ke prakope ke liye anya kaarnon ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha, vahiin bihar ke mujffarpur or padosi jilon ke adhiktar bacchon kaa tikaakaran karke japani anseflitis virus par kaaphi had tak kaabo paa liya gaya he
 But in cases of AES, doctors are forced to treat dextrose saline (a sugar solution often injected intravenously) on the basis of symptoms only because the obvious causes of AES have not yet been ascertained
 bacchon kaa khaali pet lichi khaanaa bhi is beemaari ko badha dene kaa ek kaarak bhar he
 Apparently, the death of such a large number of children due to AES has raised questions on the functioning of the government
 or balikaon se shashaktikaran kii himaayat karne vaale nitish kumaar ke liye bhi gambhir chunauti pesh kar di he
 How will his government end malnutrition and discrimination with girls to tackle AES

 According to Pooja Nagra, when she called at the Mahila police station in Panchkula, she was advised to register a case at the police station in Sector 15, but when she went to the police station in Sector 15, the behavior of the policeman stationed there was very disappointing
 unako complaint rakhane ke liye kaha lekin shikaayat darj nahin kii gai

 yashpal ke mutabik usne mahila vakil se maafee bhi maangi thi
 This is not the first time porn videos have been shared in any whatsapp group in Panchkula

 ek nae adhyayan main paaya gaya he ki budh grah apni sataha kii gaharaai main paidaa hone vaale carbon kii adhikta ke kaaran andhere se bharaa hua dikhataa he
 Researchers said that the planet reflected a lesser amount of sunlight than the moon
 chandramaa kii sataha par andhkaar vahaan paae jane vaale louh-prachur khanijon kii adhikta se niyantrit hota he
 Such minerals are rare on the surface of Mercury
 pehle vaigyanikon ne kaha tha ki budh par andhkaar us carbon kii vajah se ho saktaa he, jo aantarik soramandal main yatra karne vaale dhoomaketuon ke chalate dhire-dhire ekatra ho gaya hoga
 Researchers, led by Patric Peploski of John Hopkins University in the United States, have confirmed that there is an excessive amount of carbon on the surface of Mercury
 unhone yah bhi paaya he ki yah carbon dhoomaketuon se ekatra hone ke bajaay grah kii sataha kii gaharaai main paidaa hua lagata he
 The researchers obtained this data from a spacecraft called nasa's Messenger Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging

 Darkness on the lunar surface is controlled by the abundance of iron-rich minerals found there
 aise khanij budh kii sataha par durlabh hai
 Earlier scientists had said that the darkness on Mercury could be due to the carbon that would have slowly accumulated due to comets traveling in the inner solar system

 This is the first space mission sent into Mercury's orbit

 Neighbors also tried hard to open the door, but the door did not open, after which the window glass broke and tried to peek inside
 lekin vahaan kuch dikhaa nahin diya
 After listening to the neighbors and the maid, the police decided to break the main door of the flat

 But this was just a picture of the first sight
 ananyaa chakravarti ro ke field afasar the or sabase badi baat ye ki wo ek jindadil insaan the
 Then how can they commit suicide? So is there a deep conspiracy behind these four deaths? Is this really a case of suicide? yaa phir ise khudakushi sabit kiya ja rahaa he? maamla cabinut sachivalay me tainaat ro agent se judaa he isiilie police bhi har pahalu ko saamne rakh kar maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Top RAW officers have also been warned about this
 shuukravaar raat se hi kati thi ghar kii bijaliro afasar ke ghar kii bijli shuukravaar raat se hi kati hui thi
 No one knows who cut this power or how it was cut
 itnaa hi nahin hameshaa tamaam khidkiyaan khuli rakhane vaale chakravarti ke ghar kii sari khidkiyaan bhi shanivaar ko band thim
 Police are waiting for Chakraborty and his wife's housemates to interrogate them to find out whether the two were undergoing any stress or pressure? According to police sources, 52-year-old Ananya Chakraborty in the field of electronic technology section of RAW Used to work as an officer

 in agenciyon ke bare main bahut kam log hi jaanate hai
 Only those associated with intelligence know what is the work of these agencies and how it works
 ananyaa chakravarti ro ke isi khaas section se jude hue the

 input language gujarat or himachal pradesh ke nateezon ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ek sandesh diya he
 Addressing reporters outside Parliament on Tuesday, Rahul said that the people of Gujarat have given a message to PM Modi and BJP, anger will not work for you but love will only work
 bataa den ki gujarat or himachal pradesh main haar ke baad rahul pehali baar media ke saamne aae the
 Big things about Rahul's address
 
 
 # gujarat ke logon ko modi ji kaa model pasand nahin aayaa he
 PM Modi's development model is hollow
 # piem modi kaa propagenda acha he, marketing acchhee he
 But people do not like it
 # gujarat ke nattejey bijepi ke liye jhatka he, hamaare liye to nattejey achche aae hai
 # The people of Gujarat have taught that no matter how angry you may be, you can compete with love even if you are in opposition
 # gandhi ji ne ye baat pehle hi sikhaai thi, ab bhi ye baat gujarat ke logon main he
 # We had asked Modi ji for answers on development, but he could not give it
 unhone jai shah-rafel maamle main chuppi sadhi rahi thi
 # i went to Gujarat, told people about it in 3 months
 ham jeet sakate the, nahin jeet paae vahaan par thodi kami rah gai
 # Modiji speaking, this result is a seal on gst-development
 lekin prachaar main in baton kaa zikr hi nahin ho rahaa tha
 Demonetisation and GST were missing from his speeches
 # gujarat chunaav ke nateezon ne modiji kii credibility (vishwasaneeyata) par sawaal uthaa die hai, jo wo kah rahe hai vah bas unka sanghathan hi ripet kar rahaa he
 But the country is not listening to them
 bataa den ki gujarat main congress ko sahyogiyon ke saath 182 main se 80 siton par jeet mili he
 Whereas BJP has won the seats in 99 seats
 ek seat ensipi ke khate main gai he
 Let us tell you that after the results on Monday, PM Modi was welcomed at the BJP headquarters in Delhi
 is dauraan modi ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue bina naam liye congress par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha
 He had said that when elections for the metropolitan and municipal councils were going on in Uttar Pradesh, it was being said loudly that the BJP would end in the cities of UP due to GST
 gujarat ke chunaav ke pehle bhi isi prakaar kii afvaahon kaa jor tha
 Recently, in Maharashtra also the body elections were held after GST, where BJP also got support
 modi ne kaha ki main desh kaa bhala chaahane vaale buddhijiviyon se aagrah karata hum, ham jo yahaan baithkar desh ke saamaanya maanvi akalan karte hai
 They move in the wrong direction
 usase is prakaar ke sochane waalon kaa bhala nahin hota he
 The area and the public for which it is thought do not benefit them
 desh kaa to baar-baar nuksaan hota he
 While the BJP is busy preparing for the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections, on Monday, the Congress gave a big blow to it in the by-election in Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat of Punjab
 bijepi saansad vinod khanna kii maut ke baad khaali hui is seat par congress ummidavaar sunil jakhad ne jeet darj kii
 At the same time, the results of the Allahabad Central University Students' Union election, called Oxford, east of Oxford, were also going to shock the BJP
 jabaki is saal desh kii duusari badi uniwarsity main hue chaatrasangh chunaav ke nateezon par gaur karen to wo bhi abivipi ke kamjor hote graph kii gavaahi dete hai
 At the Allahabad University, the bjp-backed student organization ABVP suffered a major setback and the Samajwadi Student Sabha, a student organization of the Samajwadi Party, won strongly
 sapa chaatr sabhi ne paanch main se chaar siton par apana kabja jamaa liya
 Whereas in the ABVP account, only the general secretary's seat
 in nateezon ko abivipi ke liye bada jhatka isliye mana ja rahaa he kyonki pichley do saalon se elahabaad uniwarsity main abivipi kaa kabja rahaa tha
 In 2015, ABVP won four of the five seats, while in 2016, ABVP candidates won the post of president and joint secretary
 is saal ABVP kaa bura halailahabaad uniwarsity se pehle dilli kii jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity, hyderabad central uniwarsity, dilli uniwarsity, jaipur uniwarsity, gangtok uniwarsity, gadhwal central uniwarsity or punjab uniwarsity main bhi abivipi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 After 4 years in DU, the ABVP also faced a crushing defeat in the 2017 Students' Union election at Chhattisgarh University
 jabaki congress kii student ikai NSUI ko yahaan badi kamyaabi mili
 NSUI made a tremendous comeback by winning the post of president and vice-president
 jabaki ABVP ke khate main joint secetrari or secetrari pad hi gaya
 The results of DUSU were considered harmful for ABVP because it held the post of president and vice president for the last 4 years
 JNU main bhi haath khaali2015 kaa jeenyu chaatrasangh kaaphi charchit rahaa
 Because during this time Kanhaiya Kumar was the president and Shehla Rashid was the vice-president
 donon hi left sanghathanon se jude chaatraneta hai
 While Saurabh Sharma of ABVP became Joint Secretary in this student union
 ye puraa saal jeenyu ke liye vivaadon bharaa rahaa
 After the February incident, the Left organizations contested the 2016 elections and eliminated the ABVP
 left chaatr netaaon ne 2017 ke chunaav main bhi vahi stritegi apanaai or ek baar phir central panel kii chaaron siton par laal paracham laharaaya
 That is, ABVP did not get a single seat
 abivipi kaa garh samajhi jane vaali rajasthan university main bhi is baar adhyaksh pad par bijepi ummidavaar ko shikast dekhni padi
 Pawan Yadav, rebelled from ABVP for the post of President, won and defeated ABVP candidate by 2656 votes
 hyderabad uniwarsitimen bhi akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The 'alliance for Social Justice' (ASJ), a coalition of the Student Federation of India (SFI) and Ambedkar Student Association (ASA), won all the posts
 desh kii tamaam badi uniwarsity main abivipi ko ye haar aise vakt main mili jab bijepi ne upi main prachand bahumat se sarkaar banaai
 Also in small states like Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur, power also came into power
 ek taraf jahaan 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main modi kii vishaal jeet ke baad desh ke 15 se zyada rajyon main bijepi apana paracham laharaa chuki he, vahiin ab modi sarkaar ke teen saal hone par bhi uniwarsity ke yuvaaon kaa abivipi se mohabhang hona rahul gandhi or vipaksh ke aaropon ko bal detaa he

 paryaavaran or khanan ko ek-duusare kaa virdohi mana jaataa he
 Large mining activity has always been considered to be a waste to the local environment
 lagata he bihar kii nitish kumaar sarkaar isi par yakeen karti he
 The government's move not to lease or renew stone mines has made it clear how unscrupulous mining operators may have looted Bihar's estates
 faisla darasal 2010 kaa he par uskaa asar ab dhire-dhire mahasoos ho rahaa he
 While renewal of lease of stone quarries was allowed, senior officials of the district never felt any need to check on the spot that the area excavated actually matches the leased area
 or not
 akasar naukarshahi kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se yaa kabhi-kabhi mileebhagat se hota tha
 1 February 2012: Look in pictures India Today January 4, 2012: Look in pictures India Today 11 January 2012: Look in pictures India Today 18 January 2012: Look in pictures India Today 25 January 2012: Look in pictures India Today going out of leased area to operators Also used to get a chance to dig
 khanan companiyon ne acchhee quality ke pattharon kii talash main pahaado ke tamaam shikharon ko visphotakon vagairah se dhaha diya
 Things have changed since the end of the mining leases period
 khanan kii avaidh gatividhiyaan zyada saaf dhang se najar aane lagi hai
 The result: frequent raids across the state
 par shekhpura jila is baat kii misaal he ki naukarshahi sahi dakhal de to kis tarah chori-chhipe chal rahe ghotaale khulkar saamne laae ja sakate hai
 In this district 74 stone crushing plants have been demolished
 jiladhikari virendra prasad yadav kehete hai, ''ye plant uchit license ke bina chal rahe the
 In many cases it was also found that these people had extracted stones from the mines, while they had no lease
 ''bihar main pathar kii patte vaali khadaanon main se kareeb 40 fisadi shekhpura main hi hai
 Says Yadav, who launched a campaign against illegal mining, "so far, we have filed firs against more than 250 law-breakers
 kaiyon ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 "this action has pierced Barr's hive like that
" isse pataa chalaa he ki kis tarah khanan vibhaag ke mathadhish barason se bihar main avaidh khanan ko phalne-phoolne kaa mauka dete aa rahe the
 Bihar realized the severity of the situation after the bifurcation of the state in November 2000
 khanan vibhaag ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''jharkhand ke nirmaan ke baad, bihar main bahut kam pahadiyaan bachi thim
 It took some time for the state leaders to realize that indiscriminate mining has permanently leveled the few peaks of the remaining hills in Bihar
 '' yah bhi pataa chalaa ki patte par di gai har ek meter jameen ke maamle main beparwaah khanan oparator jameen se ek meter or pathar khod lete the, jiskaa khamiyaja sarkaar ke rajasav ko or paryaavaran ko bhugatna padataa tha
 Sources in the police headquarters say that other big issues have also been related to it
 maowad prabhavit jilon main chal rahi avaidh stone krashing ikaayiyon kii maovadiyon ke saath praayah gahari santh-ganth rahati thi
 There were also clues that explosives were being supplied to Maoists through stone crushing units operating in Naxalite affected areas of the state
 pathar kii khadaanon ke liye patta na dene yaa unka navinikaran na karne ke faisle ko bada saahasik faisla kaha ja rahaa he
 This was taken as the state is rebuilding its infrastructure and construction work is going on vigorously
 par bihar ko zyada chintaa paryaavaran kii he kyonki khanan udyog ne pahadiyon ko chalni kar daalaa he
 The government hopes that stopping the mining will not affect the revenue as other resources like sand and brick and kiln are abundant in Bihar
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ''apane paryaavaran, paristhitiki, paudhon or jantuon ko bachaane ke liye ab bihar khudaai or khanan kii gatividhiyon par roak laga rahaa he
 "the mining department has imposed a major condition that no lease will be given for excavation of stones
 pehle kii lij maanya hongi lekin unka navinikaran nahin hoga
 All existing leases are expected to expire in 2014
 yani bihar jald hi khadaan mukt rajya ho jayega
 Lobbies are ready in the Opposition but it is decided that Nitish government will not reconsider it
 khanan ke par katare jane se in garib jilon main kaam-dhandhe kaa swaroop badalegaa
 Otherwise these cities used to live and die only for stone mines
 jo bhi hona tha, ho chukaa he
 Now Bihar officials should find those bureaucrats who have worn sheep skin, who have been making illegal mining their money for so many years
 jin logon ne yah sab hote rahane diya, ve abhi bhi kanoon ke daayre se baahar hai

 They see demonetisation as another jumble in the list of jumlas — an economical trick like cleaning the hand — which Modi has leapt into the air to hide his wretched performance
 ye log kah rahe hai ki notebandi kaale dhan ko ukhaad phenkane ke praathmik uddeshy main naakaam ho gai he or usne arthvyavastha ko jo pidaa pahunchaai he, usase koi laabh hasil nahin hone vaala he
 The decision is still to be decided, but Modi is absolutely calm in the midst of this storm

 Mahatma Gandhi's clinging eyes were hanging from the picture hanging on the wall

 At that time, his ministers were gathering for a cabinet meeting in which they were to discuss, among other things, what further steps are to be taken on demonetisation
 kursi par bilkul tanakar baithe modi ne apane kandhe se aalochanaon kii dhul ko jhaad phenkate hue kaha, ''aap is baat ko samajhen ki hamane notebandi kaa faisla kisi alpakaaleen laabh ke chalate nahin kiya he, balki yah dirghakaalin dhanchaagat badlaav ke liye he
 Our aim was to actually liberate the economy and society from the curse of black money and eliminate the mistrust, fake pressures and other diseases that come with it
 "unke aatmavishvaas kii vajah poochne par ve bole, ''agar aap spashtataa or shuddhtam manshaa ke saath kaam karenge to parinaam sabake dekhne laayak honge

 "then he started drawing the Indian version of the great American dream
 ''main ek aisa bharat chahta hum jahaan kaa kisaan sukhi ho, vyapaaree sampann, har mahila shashakt ho or yuva rojgararat ho
 An India where every family has a house and every family has access to basic facilities like water, electricity and toilets

 It was in this office that his daughter and successor Indira Gandhi took a decisive economic decision in 1969 to nationalize all banks
 usee saal unhone rajshahi ke privipurs ko samaapt kiya, jo aarambh main sansad main paarit nahin ho sakaa lekin baad main 1971 main lagu ho gaya jab unhen chunaavon main bahumat hasil hua

 Despite this, the recent Prime Minister has been taking his decisive decisions in the first year of his tenure, but Modi spent half his term doing so
 aarthik morche par khud ko bazaar hitaishi dikhaane ke baad jab ve satta main aae to unke kadamon se aisa laga ki kahin ve bharose ko tod na den
 His first two budgets were not the bearers of major economic reforms, but rather a policy of continuity and minor changes
 jab hamen unase sabase kam ummid thi, thik tabhi unhone notebandi kaa bam phod kar aarthik pokaran rach daalaa
 The prime minister's reasoning behind this decision is that there was an urgent need to end black money here to make India "a developed nation and a global force"
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah kadam un aatanki samoohon or jaali note chhapane waalon ko rokane ke liye he jo seemaa paar se apana kaam karte hai

 Modi is actually repeating the strategy adopted by Indira Gandhi to see her as the new messiah of the poor and the underprivileged

 The message at its core is that the salaried class and the working class are honest taxpayers, while rich people exploit the flaws of the system and accumulate illegal funds
 aise main modi kaa mantra yah he ki ve na sirf dhan-sampada nirmit karnaa chaahate hai (audyogic vruddhi ko samarthan dekar) balki uske punarvitaran ke liye bhi jor laga rahe hai taaki vah asamanta or shoshan khatm ho sake jisase majdoor varg pratadit hota aayaa he
 It is a mixture of neo-marxism and market that Deng Xiaoping had realized in China in the eighties

 "while doing so, Modi is going beyond the traditional vote bank of the BJP and the saffron family, behind which it is expected that by 2019 the party's voters will be widened

 By bringing these notes within the formal economy in the open, the government will get additional benefit from economic penalties
 modi kii team maanati he ki itane nakad ke pravaah main aane se yah vruddhi main utprerak kii bhoomika nibhaayega
 As a proof that the general public has confidence in Modi, he cites the fact that after 8 November there was neither violence nor any organized protest about demonetisation
 ve yah bhi maanate hai ki janvari kaa maheenaa khatm hote-hote nakadi kaa sankat bhi kam ho jayega
 Modi has another trump card coming in his hand to be presented on February 1

 Meanwhile, in 2016, Modi also proved to be a game-changer on the foreign policy front

 But after the initial campaign to win hearts, including his sudden visit to Lahore, his efforts to improve relations with Pakistan were in the doldrums
 modi ne sitambar main palat waar kiya or pakistan kii seemaa ke kaaphi bheetar ghuskar sabase badi sargical strike ko kamyaabi ke saath anjaam diya
 He had to take this step two weeks ago following an attack on a military contingent at Uri

 unhone sindhu jal sandhi par phir se vichaar karne kaa mudda bhi uthaaya or pakistan ko hadakaane ke liye bluechistan ke algaavvaadiyon kii taraf sahanubhuti kaa haath badhaayaa
 By bringing an element of uncertainty to India's response, Modi firmly changed the course of relations with Pakistan
 unke saath najdiki se kaam rahe ek afasar bataate hai ki modi kuch bhi aaveg yaa uttejnaa main nahin karte
 They say that if you tried to understand by taking different steps on the foreign policy front, you would know that the result of this would be in the surgical strike against Pakistan

 There is a logical consistency in what his critics call Pakistan's policy in India

 The arrest of Peter Mukherjee in the Sheena Bora murder case has raised many questions on the Mumbai Police
 sawaal he sibiai ko peter mukherjee ke khilaaf aisa kya saboot mil gaya ki usne achaanak se peter ko giraftaar kar liya
 That too on the same day he filed a charge sheet against the three already arrested accused
 sibiai sutron se pataa chalaa he ki indrani se poochtacha ke baad peter kii giraftaar kii jameen taiyaar hui
 In several days of continuous questioning by the Mumbai Police, Peter denied information about the murder of Shenabora
 peter ne yah bhi kaha tha ki use abhi tak yahi pataa tha ki shina unki patni indrani kii beti he
 Indrani introduced her as his younger sister
 lekin jaankaree mil rahi he ki peter kii yah daleel sibiai kii gale nahin utari
 Because after Sheena Bora's sudden disappearance, Peter made no attempt to find her
 unhone aankh moond kar indrani kii baat par bharosa kar liya ki shina hameshaa ke liye america rahane chali gai
 The question is can anyone be told like this? shina ho saktaa he peter ko kuch na bataae, lekin peter ke bete or apane premi rahul mukherjee ko jarur bataati par usne rahul ko bhi kuch nahin bataaya
 Rahul was the one who left Sheena till Indrani's car on 24 April 2012
 shina ke achaanak laapata hone se pareshaan hokar usne mumbai ke alag- alag thanon main laapata kii shikaayat darj karaani chaahi thi, lekin tab police ne bhi indrani kii baat par bharosa kar shikaayat darj nahin kiya tha
 It is said that Rahul once asked Peter that Sheena's passport is with him, then how can she go to America
 tab indrani ne kaha tha ki shina ne nayaa passport banavaa liya he
 At least then Peter should have doubted Indrani, but Peter had scolded and silenced Rahul
 iske alaava shina kii hatya or uskaa shav le jane ke liye bhi kiraaye kii jis car kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha us car agency eem motor kaa maalik bhi peter kaa dost he or car bhi peter ke naam se hi book thi
 That is, there are many such things which bring doubt to Peter Mukherjee
 isliye sibiai ko lagata he ki peter ko shina bora kii hatya kii jaankaree thi, lekin unhone chipaaye rakhaa
 So he also arrested Peter as soon as he filed a charge sheet against Girfatar Sheena's mother Indrani Mukherjee, stepfather Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai
 ab sibiai yah jaanane main lagi he ki peter ko shina kii hatya kii jaanakri vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke pehle se thi yaa phir baad main? agar pehle se hogi to peter hatya kii sajeesh ke aaropee ban sakate hai
 If it had happened later, the accused could be accused of hiding the truth, especially to save Indrani
 tippaniyan With this, the CBI questioned Peter Mukherjee's son Rahul for more than 12 hours
 sutron ne kaha ki rahul kaa shina ke saath kathith taur par prem sambandh tha
 He was called to the CBI office in south Mumbai last night
 use aaj subah lagbhag saadhe das baje sibiai karyaalay se baahar aate hue dekha gaya
 Sources said that Rahul was asked whether he and Sheena had told Peter that Sheena was not Indrani's sister but a daughter
 unhone kaha ki usase yah bhi poocha gaya ki varsh 2012 main shina ke gaayab ho jane ke baad kya usne kabhi shina kii suraksha ko lekar chintaa jataai thi? (also from the input language) sibiai sutron se pataa chalaa he ki indrani se poochtacha ke baad peter kii giraftaar kii jameen taiyaar hui

 Upset over the sudden disappearance of Sheena, she wanted to file a missing complaint in different police stations in Mumbai, but even then the police did not trust Indrani's complaint
 bataate hai ki rahul ne peter ko ek baar poocha bhi tha ki shina kaa passport to uske paas he phir vah america kaise ja sakati he
 Indrani had then said that Sheena had got a new passport made
 kam se kam tab peter ko indrani par shaq karnaa chahie tha, lekin peter ne to rahul ko hi daantkar chup kara diya tha
 Apart from this, the owner of the car agency AM Motor, which was used to kill Sheena and take her body, is also Peter's friend and the car was also booked in the name of Peter
 yani kai aisi baaten hai, jo peter mukherjee ko andeh ko ghere main laati hai
 So the CBI feels that Peter was aware of the killing of Sheena Bora, but he kept it hidden
 isliye usne pehle se giraftar shina kii maa indrani mukherjee, sautele pita sanjeev khanna or driver shyamvar raay ke khilaaf aarope patr daayar karte hi peter ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 Now the CBI is starting to know whether Peter was aware of Sheena's murder before or after the crime was committed
 If already done, Peter could be accused of plotting murder
 agar baad main hui hogi thi aropiyon khaskar indrani ko bachaane ke liye sachai chhipaane kaa aarope ban saktaa he
 The comments isse saath hi sibiai ne peter mukherjee ke bete rahul se 12 ghante se zyada samay tak poochtacha kii
 Sources said that Rahul reportedly had a love affair with Sheena
 use kal raat dakshini mumbai sthit sibiai karyaalay bulaayaa gaya
 He was seen coming out of the CBI office at around 10

 sutron ne kaha ki rahul se yah poocha gaya tha ki kya usne or shina ne peter ko yah bataaya tha ki shina indrani kii bahan nahin balki beti he

 Angry at the meeting of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indian Americans have adopted a new method of protest
 ek activist group ne jakarberg ko modi se mulaakaat ke baad haath dhone kii salaah dete hue 250 bottle seinatizer bhi bhej diya
 Addressing the group Nejkerberg, who runs a campaign called 'juck, Wash Your Hands' on the internet, said that Modi's hands are stained with blood and after meeting him, he should clean the hands thoroughly with the sanitizer
 is baat se unka ishaara 2002 main gujarat main hue dangon se tha
 Each bottle says that a riot victim named Mark had met Mark Zuckerberg in the Silicon Valley's facebook headquarters
 is mulaakaat kaa virodh kar rahe logon kaa aarope he ki modi 2002 main hue gujarat dangon ke doshi hai
 Around 2000 Muslims were killed in the riots
 group ne jakarberg ko seinatizer kii 250 bottlen bheji hai or har bottle main ek danga peedit kaa naam likhaa he
 The group has appealed to people in a message posted on its online website to send Zackerberg a sanitizer on their behalf and register their protest

 The time of Asaram Bapu has also changed
 police ne unhen giraftaar kya kiya, unke bol hi badal gaye
 Till yesterday, the same place has become impure for Asaram, who laughingly calls the jail as Baikuntha
 ab ve jail nahin janaa chaahate
 Asaram was arrested from his Indore ashram at 12:30 pm on Saturday night
 iske baad se hi unhen yah bhi abhas ho gaya ki ab jail kothri bahut dur nahin he
 Probably hidden from the police for so many days, it must have been because all the tricks and tricks of the law are understood
 padhein:ek din kii police hiraasat main asaramapako yaad hoga, kuch din pehle (jab tak unhen lagata tha ki unke samarthakon ke chalate police unhen pakad nahin paaegi) asaram ne kaha tha, 'agar ve mujhe jail main bhi daal dete hai, to hansate hue jail jane ko taiyaar hum
 i want to spend some time in Tihar Jail
 main samajhataa hum ki jail meraa baikunth he
 Then Asaram also appealed to his followers to maintain peace
 lekin samay ko abhi badalanaa tha
 Time changed
 shanivaar ko police ne indore main asaram kaa ashram gher liya
 The police threw all their strength in keeping their devotees away from them and arrested Asaram
 padhein:jail main apavitra ho jaaoongaa: asaramsamay aisa badla ki baapu ko 'jail rupi baikunth' kaa dar sataane laga
 On Sunday, he told the court that he should not be sent to jail, because people of criminal nature live there
 asaram ne kaha, 'jail main aparaadh pravriti ke log rahete hai
 Going there i will become impure
 ' baapu kaa baikunth dham ab apavitra ho gaya he
 Asaram also argued that asanas cannot be held in jail
 jab unhen indore se dilli laayaa gaya to ve apni seat par baithe-baithe maala pher rahe the
 Probably must have been wishing that 'baikuntha' would not have to go
 gauratlab he ki asaram ke khilaaf ek naaballig ladki ke mata-pita ne dilli ke kamala market thana main 20 agast ko shikaayat darj karai thi ki jab ve log jodhpur ke ashram main gaye the to asaram ne ladki se yon hinsa kii

 aspalaal ke prisimple rajeev mishra ko shanivaar ko suspend kar diya gaya tha unhone 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha he ki vah bekasoor hai or sara dosha oxigen saplir company kaa he
 On Saturday, the health minister of the state, Siddharth Singh, suspended the Principal of BRD Hospital for irresponsible attitude
 unka kahana hai ki sarkaar ko jo karrwai kerani thi vah kii, lekin is maamle main meraa koi kasoor nahin he
 Rajeev Mishra said that he had an 8-year contract with Pushpa Sales, an oxygen supply company and they should have supplied gas
 oxigen saplir company ko doshi tehraate hue rajeev mishra ne kaha ki agar siem yogi adityanath is maamle kii thik se jaanch karenge to unhen sach pataa chalegi kimeri koi galati nahinhai
 Mishra said that the statement made by the Health Minister on Saturday is correct
 aspataal main agast ke maah main zyada mautein hoti hai
 Denying the allegations of the gas supply company, Mishra said that the commission's charge was totally false
 company kii ore se aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki aspataal ke prisimple kii ore se kamishan kii maang kii gai thi or kamishan naa dene par gas company ne bhugtan main deree kaa aarope lagaaya tha

 a post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37 am PST (input: IANS se bhi) The Masturi Assembly seat in Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh is reserved for the Scheduled Castes
 is seat parcongreska kabja he
 Whereas before this, the BJP won twice in a row
 120 kilometre ke ilaake main faile is chunaav kshetra ke siyaasi sameekaran badalte rahe hai
 After delimitation in 2008, a large part of the Sipat assembly has been included
 iske chalate yahaan ke raajnneetik sameekaran kaaphi badal gaye hai
 Major leaders like Ganesh Ram Anant, Bansi Lal Ghritlarahe have been ministers in Madhya Pradesh government by winning elections from this Congress-occupied seat
 1998 main pehali baar ye seat bhaajapa ke kabje main ai, madan singh dahariya yahaan se chunaav jite, lekin 2000 main chhattisgarh banane ke baad ve congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Madan Singh Dahria of the Congress was defeated by bjp's Krishnamurthy Bandhi in the 2003 assembly elections and became the Health Minister of the state
 2008 main bhi dow baandhi phir chunaav jite, lekin 2013 main unhen dilip singh lahariya ke haathon haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 2013 election results Dilip Dilip Singh Laharia of Congress received 86509 votes
 bijepi ke krishnamurthi baandhi ko 62363 vot mili the
 The 2008 Legislative Election result: Krishnamurthy Bandhi of BJP received 54002 votes
 congress ke madan singh dahaaria ko 44794 vot mili the
 The 2003 result was Krishnamurthy Bandhi of BJP with 40485 votes
 congress ke madan singh dahaaria ko 38217 vot mili the
 When talking about caste equation, there is a large section of SC and ST voters
 iske alaavanishad, rajak, kurmi, sahu, yadav, brahman, thakur samaaj ke voter bhi achche khaase hai
 This is the reason why BSP has also influenced the seat
 bispi ko pichley teen chunaav se yahaan kareeb 20 hajaar vot milte rahe hai
 Chhattisgarh equation tell you that there are total 90 assembly seats in Chhattisgarh
 rajya main abhi kul 11 loksabhaa or 5 rajyasabha kii siten hai
 There are a total of 27 districts in Chhattisgarh
 rajya main kul 51 siten saamaanya, 10 siten essi or 29 siten asti ke liye arakshit hai
 Raman Singh's hat-trick in 2013 The results of the 2013 assembly elections were announced on 8 December
 inamen bhartiya janata party ne rajya main lagaataar teesri baar congress ko maat dekar sarkaar banaai thi
 The BJP won a total of 49 assembly seats in 2013 led by Raman Singh
 jabaki congress sirf 39 siten hi jeet pai thi
 While 2 seats went to others
 2008 ke mukaable bijepi ko teen siten kam mili thim, iske baavjood unhone purna bahumat se apni sarkaar banaai
 Raman Singh is the Chief Minister of the state since 2003
 chaalu vitt varsh kii pahalitimahike jidipi aankade kendra sarkaar ke liye badi raahat lekar ai he
 However, economic experts claim that the figures for the first quarter do not give an assessment of the economic situation, which gives some reason to be happy
 aisa isliye ki jahaan chauthi timahi kaa aankada puure ek saal keaarthik vikaaski disha ko saaf darshaate hai, vahiin pehali timahi ke aankade mahaj twarit anumaan par aadhaarit rahete hai
 So the first quarter figures only indicate how the economy might do in the next three quarters
 vitt varsh 2018-19 kii pehali timahi (april-june) ke dauraan vikaas dar do saal ke sheersh str 8
 Reached 2 percent
 gauratlab he ki is timahi ke dauraan gros vailu aded (jivie) growth ratet 8 fisadi rahaa or yah aankade utpaadak athwa supplai ke mutabik growth kaa aankalan dete hai vahiin jidipi aankada upabhokta athwa demand ko kendra main rakhte hue aankalan ko darshata he
 Significantly, the growth rate during the last quarter of the last financial year is 7
 7 fisadi rahi vahiin isi vitt varsh kii pehali timahi main ye aankada 5
 Stood at 59 percent
 jidipi aankadon ke aadhaar par kendra sarkaar main aarthik maamalon ke sachiv essi garg kaa daawa he ki desh kii aarthik sthiti saamaanya ho chuki he
 Garg said that earlier the growth rate of 8 percent was recorded in the first quarter of 2016-17
 ab 8 timahiyon ke baad 8 fisadi ke upar kii growth darj hui he
 This clearly means that with the country's economic condition returning to normal, now the economy has reached the path of running at a faster pace
 kendra sarkaar ke sachiv ke daavon par purv vitt mantri or congress netaa pi chidambaram kii daleel he ki jidipi aankade mahaj aankade hai
 At the same time, the real state of the economy can be estimated from the depreciating rupee against the dollar
 banking karmchaariyon kii sanstha kaa daawa he ki kendra sarkaar ke ye aankade adhik dinon tak raahat nahin denge
 Vishwas Utagi, Vice President of the banking institution said that this growth figure is only for April, May and June 2018
 isse pehle pichley vitt varsh ke dauraan vikaas dar 5
 3 per cent and the current figure is 5
 3 fisadi kii growth ko aadhaar banaate hue die gaye hai
 Vishwas claims that while the growth rate was falling continuously during the last nine quarters, more than 8 percent growth in the first quarter of 2019 will not be sustained for long
 vahiin india today ke sampadak anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki 8
 GDP growth of 2 per cent
 13 in the manufacturing sector
 5 fisadi kii darj growth ke aadhaar par he
 However, there is a significant contradiction between these two figures
 pehali timahi ke growth aankadon main manuphaccharing sector ke growth aankadon ko is dauraan hue jiesti collection se bal nahin mil rahaa he
 On the other hand, the single digit growth recorded in the service sector does not encourage private sector investment
 in donon virodhabhas ke chalate in aankadon ke aadhaar par nahin kaha ja saktaa ki desh kii arthvyavastha patari par laut chuki he
 So, 8 in the first quarter
 2 fisadi kii growth ek acha sanket he lekin ise arthvyavastha kii maujuuda chunautiyon ke khatm hone kaa sanket nahin mana ja saktaa

 Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid expressed anger over the recent spot-fixing episode and the results that followed, saying that maintaining the credibility of cricket is of the utmost importance and that the cricketers could lose the respect of their fans if not done
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah khel apane prashansakon kii vajah se he jo iskaa bahut sammaan karte hai
 The bcci's credibility began to be questioned after the spot-fixing and betting episode surfaced in the sixth season of the IPL
 is prakaran ke kaaran en shrinivasana ko bisisiai adhyaksh pad se kinaaraa karnaa padaa
 Even the Bombay High Court termed the investigation of a two-member panel constituted by the board to investigate the matter as "illegal and unconstitutional"
 dravid ne kaha, ‘is tarah kii chizon se madad nahin milegi, jab ham akhabaaron ke pichley pannon ke bajaay pehle pannon kii sukhiryon main hai
 He said, "there are a lot of fans and a lot of people who respect this game very much and it is because of these fans that we are here as cricketers
 prashaasak bhi yahaan prashasankon or cricktaron kii vajah se hi hai isaliye khel yaa board yaa yahaan tak ki sarkaar kii vishwasaneeyata bhi mahatvapurn he, bhale hi aap kuch bhi karo
 If your life is public then it is very important
 ’ dravid ne kaha, ‘isse cricketron ke prati sammaan or pyaar kuch kam ho saktaa he or mujhe lagata he ki agar yah hona he to desh main cricket ke liye yah sachmuch bahut dukhad he
 Another former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said that administrators do not respond appropriately to such a crisis as they know that fans will never turn away from the game, whatever happens
 manjrekar ne kaha, ‘jab match phixing kii baat 1999-2000 main bhartiya cricket main saamne aayi thi, jab kuch sheersh bhartiya cricketer pratibandhit kiye gayi the, logon ne sochaa ki bhartiya cricket par vishwasaneeyata kaa karaara jhatka lagegaa or iske baad yah nichle str par pahunch jaayegaa
 He said, 'I remember, immediately after this incident there was an india-zimbabwe series and every seat in the stadium was filled
 isaliye mujhe lagata he ki kahin na kahin prashaasak jaanate hai ki in sabake baavjood log is khel ke prati jununee bane rahenge
 Manjrekar said, "somewhere the administrators feel that they can avoid it and i think it does not help to put pressure on the management of Indian cricket
" ’ lekin unhone yah bhi kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki bhartiya prashansakon ne bina kisi shart ke cricket se pyaar kiya he lekin lambey samay tak prashaasak yaa bisisiai iskaa phayda nahin uthaa sakate
 ' agar aap kaam ke dauraan lambey samay tak khadey rahete hai to aap yah khabar jarur padhein

 Looking at the atmosphere created today, this fear will be said

 When the terrorists fear the valor of the soldiers in the terrorists, this fear is good
 jab mamaa ke bolne se bade-bade parivaar baukhala jaaen, to yah dar acha he

 madhya pradesh ke harda main hue train haadase ke baad rail mantralay ne jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 Kamayani Express and Janata Express have been victims of one incident after another at the same place between Harda to Windowsia station
 do train patari se utar gayi, jisase haadase main 28 logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki 100 se adhik ghayal ho gaye hai
 There are several possible reasons for the accident
 aaie jaanate hai kyon hua ye haadasa-1)madhya pradesh main pichley kuch dinon se lagaataar barish ho rahi he
 As such, almost all the rivers of the state are in spate
 rail mantralay ke mutabikdurghatnapatariyon ke pani main duube hone ke kaaran hui
 Railway spokesperson Anil Saxena said that the railway track was subsided due to heavy rains
 2)yah haadasa kaali maachak nadi ke paas bani choti puliya par bana he
 Some people say that the condition of the culvert was also not well in advance and due to the strong flow of water, the culvert got buried
 isi vajah sekamyani expreske aakhri dibbe patari se utar gaye or lagbhag usee samay bagal vaali patari par janata express kaa ingine or dibbe bhi patari se utar gaye
 3) The accident occurred late Wednesday at 11:45 pm
 raat kaa andhera or tej barish main patari parapani ke tej bahaavako bhi haadase kaa prabal kaaran mana ja rahaa he
 4) Former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi said that the condition of the culvert was not good, so passing the train from this is like playing with the lives of the people
 5)railway board ke chairman eke mittal kaa kahana he ki haadase se thik pehle do patariyon se train gujri thi
 In such a situation, after 10 accidents, it shows that there was a strong flow of water at the time
 achaanak khub sara pani aayaa or patariyaan dhans gayi
 6) AK Mittal also said that the culvert was submerged in water
 7)haadase ke peeche ek kaaran yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki tej barish ke kaaran achaanak flash water aane se kareeb 150 meter trek ke neeche se mitti nikal gai
 8) Some experts also believe that the driver of the train coming at a high speed must have applied a sudden brake on the culvert due to the fast flow, due to which the bogies derailed

 i always feel the emptiness that my character felt
 aap 'hive' ke saath badi ummiido ko kaise puraa karengi ?main har baar ummiido par khara utarane kii koshish karuungi

 a hearing was held in the Supreme Court to transfer the cases against Bihar's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Mohammad Shahabuddin and Delhi
 supreme court ne ek baar phir bade sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki kya samvidhan ke die fere trial ke adhikaar ko sirf aaropee tak simit rakhana chahie? kya ise peedit ke adhikaron se jodakar nahin dekhnaa chahie? kyonki fere trial nahin hoga to peedit ko bhi pareshaani hogi
 On the other hand, if an accused repeatedly tries to postpone the trial in the case, then it is a big torture for the victim
 buudhvaar ko shahabuddin ne supreme court main kaha ki un par lagaae gaye aarope raajnneeti se prerit hai
 The media has made his case a big issue
 agar unako tihaad jail transfar karenge to unke adhikaron kaa hanan hoga
 With this, Shahabuddin questioned the CBI and asked whether he has been made an accused in the investigation of Rajdev Ranjan murder case
 The Supreme Court will continue hearing the case on Thursday
 shahabuddin ne kaha ki agar saare 45 cese sibiai ko transfar kiye gaye to maamle kii sunwaayee main or deree hogi kyonki maamalon se sambandhit dastavej jutaney main do saal lag jaaenge
 The court held an important hearing to transfer cases against Bihar RJD (RJD) leader Mohammad Shahabuddin and Delhi
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne bihar sarkaar se poocha tha ki agar nichali adaalat ne shahabuddin ko bahes ke liye vakil muhaiyaa karaayaa tha to us aadesh ko hoicourt main chunauti dene kii jarurat kya thi
 If Shahabuddin was seeking legal help from the court, what was the harm in giving it to him
 is par bihar sarkaar ne kaha tha ki shahabuddin ko vidhik sahaayta kii jarurat nahin thi or sarkaar iskaa kharchaa nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi, kyonki shahabuddin sakasham hai ki ve apane liye kisi vakil ko bahes ke liye niyukt kar saken
 In fact, the sessions court had made Shahabuddin a lawyer through legal aid to debate the pending cases against him, which was challenged by the Bihar government in the High Court and the High Court stayed the order of the sessions court
 iske baad uske khilaaf sabhi maamalon par roak lag gai thi
 At the same time, the Bihar government again said that Shahabuddin should not be transferred from Bihar nor the case
 vahiin shahabuddin kii taraf se kaha gaya ki vah pichley 11 saal se jail main he, aise main uske paas paise nahin hai ki ve bahes ke liye vakil rakh saken
 The comments maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta kii taraf se kaha gaya ki jis taraf pappu yadav ko bihar kii jail se dilli kii tihaad jail main transfar kiya gaya tha or maamle kii sunwaayee bihar main hi ho rahi thi usee tarah shahabuddin ko bihar se tihaad jail transfar kar maamle kii sunwaayee bihar main hi kii ja sakati he
 Shahabuddin can be produced in court through video conferencing if needed
 supreme court ne saaf kiya ki jo maamle hai court ke saamne lambit hai unamem dakhal nahin denge lekin shahabuddin ko bihar se tihaad jail transfar kiya jaae yaa nahin, is par vichaar jarur karenge
