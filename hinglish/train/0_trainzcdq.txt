 Vatan remembers the martyrdom of the martyrs, but what is happening about the martyrs in Bihar cannot be said to be appropriate in any way

 The Bihar government announced a grant of Rs five lakh to the dependents of the martyrs, but no Bihar government minister went to pay tribute
 aara ke shahid ke pita ne bete kii yaad main smarak banane ke liye do gaj jameen kii maang kii, jise jila prashasan ne nahin mana to unhone muaavja lene se inkaar kar diya
 The BJP even alleged that the carriage of the martyrs had to be stopped because of the convoy of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 upmukhyamantri patna airport ke chand kadamon kii duuri par the lekin wo bhi shaheedon ko shradhanjali dene nahin gaye
 Let me tell you, this is not the first time that the state government has been accused by the families of the martyrs
 vahiin bhojpur ke shahid abhaya mishra ke pita gajendra mishra apane bete kii yaad main ek smarak bananaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, they have demanded land from the Bhojpur district administration
 lekin jila prashasan ne unki maang ko yah kah kar thukraa diya ki jabatak mukhyalay se aadesh nahi aata tabatak wo jameen nahi de sakate hai
 The martyr's father said that the government could not pay two yards for the martyr's son, so he has returned the compensation amount

 i will not comment too much on such a sensitive issue, i will just say that it is unfortunate, such an incident spoils the image of Bihar in the country, and in future the Chief Minister should avoid such an incident
 susheel modi ne bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ko bhi aade haathon liya, or kaha jab umr thi tejasvi yadav kii padhai-likhaai karne kii, kuch samajhane kii to wo jameen likhva rahe the, to unase kya ummid kar sakate hai

 At the Rose Garden, US President Donald Trump was reading his speech and Prime Minister Modi was listening carefully to it
 thik usee vakt tej hawa ke jhuke se piem modi ke podium par rakhekuch dastavej udakar neeche girgaye
 But Doval, seated in the next line, held him up to the ground and put him back on the podium

 a clarification on Dofad in Congress when Sibal was asked why many big Congress leaders, including former Finance Minister p Chidambaram, did not sign the proposal for impeachment sent to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu
 To this, Sibal said that the Congress did not ask Chidambaram to sign it, because there are many cases pending on him and i am his advocate
 sijeai kii adaalat main ab na jane kaa meraa faisla unke liye nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 Sibal is currently lobbying in the case of p Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram as well as many important cases including Ayodhya

 Sadly, it turned out to be lifeless and senseless
 virendra or lasajlo ko main kabhi nahin paa saki kyonki unka koi vajood hi nahin tha
 They were fictitious characters around whom dreams are woven
 romantic filmein hamen phantasy bunane kaa mauka detii hai or ham ummid main jite rahete hai
 Today there is hope for the Buddha and only mercy can be given to the Buddha
 kya kahin, koi hamaare liye he? agar vah hamen fasebuk, twitor, linkdin yaa shaadi dot com par nahin dhundh paaya yaa pai he to ham uskaa intjaar nahin karne ja rahe hai
 Romantic comedy has definitely replaced romantic films
 soundtrack main vaayalin kii laharaati aawaaj kii jagah tej dhamaake vaale sangeet, pop, sitiyaan or flush sound ne lee he
 The woman who used to wait for her lover or to run in her arms is now considered an old fashioned woman
 darshak hansanaa chahta he, aansu bahaane vaale fasaane nahin chahta
 The dialogues should also be tempered by humor
 agar koi mard kisi aurat ko baahon main sametataa he to use aise ‘hansi vaale joardaar’ kshan laane ke liye apana sir uske sir se takaraana hoga
 If he proposes, he must reject it because the institution of marriage is outdated
 ab hero ko thukraayaa nahin jaataa, ek best friend ke rup main apni morrkhtaa se hi hero uphaas kaa paatr ban saktaa he
 Romance has become an old fashion thing in the world of SMS language and word abbreviations, when true love meant sacrifice
 romance mard or aurat ke bich main hota he
 Now the main protagonist of the romantic comedy has grown from boys and girls to men and women
 pyaar sexual chemistry kaa paryaay ban gaya he
 They, and perhaps all of us, are very immature and autistic in terms of dealing with things like sacrifice
 yah ‘pehle main’ kaa yug he
 The idea of love has changed, so perhaps the concept of romance is now actually going to produce comedy
 main ise jigso lav syndrome kahati hum
 We no longer have the patience or time to adapt or change ourselves
 hamen aise vyakti kii jarurat he jo hamaare jivan main rach-bas jaae
 As soon as someone on Facebook accepts our Friendship Request, we can find out the past, present, likes and dislikes of our potential partner
 hamane unke bare main raay bhi kaayam kar lee he or apana nirnay bhi le liya he
 The problem is that the person is not the same
 har jigso pis ke chaar said hote hai, isliye usase chaar nishchit sambhaavna ho sakati he
 Why stick with one when three others are present
 hamaari apni aakanksha ke alaava hamaare upar or kisi bahari takat kaa dabaav nahin he
 We do not have parental control over us, and it is absolutely impractical to run away with a lover without money, phone or internet and live in a hut on the banks of a river
 aaj meri 15 varsh kii bhatiji or uske doston kii apane bhavishya ke liye bas ek ichha he: vah beshak safed ghode par savaar koi sundar rajkumaar na ho, lekin vah khub dhani ho
 Needless to say, apart from our unbridled desire to indulge in consumptionism, romance is for ill-fated idiots
 apni premika ke saath guitar ke taar chhedate hue premugit gaate ladke vishwasaneey nahin hai
 Only webcough-romantic foals are in love with unbridled emotion
 yathartwaadee to mahangi car hasil karne kii koshish karata he
 Fairy tales are for children
 vayaskon ke liye twitor he jahaan kisi film ke uske shuruaati hafte se pehle hi hit yaa flop hone kaa purvanumaan laga liya jaataa he
 Viewers want to know his story before watching the film
 khoj karne kaa saundarya khatm ho chukaa he kyonki ab ham aisi duniya ke aadi ho chuke hai jisamenek batan dabaane se tatkaal suchanaaen ham tak pahunch jaati hai
 To know the full twist of the film's story, sitting for three hours watching the film is like a death sentence
 bydaree life ghatate hi phone or rishte donon vyarth lagane lagate hai
 Photos and messages are lost in data transfer
 ab aise bakse nahin hote jinamein bhari tasviren or letters dhire-dhire sampada main badal jaaen
 The barren land of emotions is constantly getting bigger and bigger
 ham naveenatam oparating plateform or ek khaali memory card ke dam par aaazaad or bojhamukt bane hue hai
 Now it seems that romantic films are a thing of the past
 shaayad hamane aisi antim film dekh lee he
 For this we have to blame ourselves and our smartphone
 devika bhagat patakatha lekhak hai jiophone users will no longer get the benefit of Rs 49 plan
 jiophone users will now have to buy from the starting price of Rs 75
 On December 6, Reliance Jio changed the tariff plans
 haalanki is dauraan company ne jeeophone plance kii keemton main badhotaree nahin kii thi
 The company has not yet increased the prices of these plans, but the cheapest Rs
 49 jiophone plan has been removed
 ab plance 75 rupee se shuru ho rahe hai
 a few weeks ago Jio introduced new all-in-one plans for jiophone users
 75 rupee vaala plan isi kaa hissaa he
 There are also plans for recharge for jiophone subscribers with Rs 99, Rs 153, Rs 297 and Rs 594, but customers will have to recharge the IUC top-up for non-jio minutes
 reliance jeeyo ke jeeophone ne 1,500 rupee keemat hone kii vajah se lakhon graahakon ko aakarshith kiya tha
 However, the best thing for jiophone users was that a Rs 49 plan was available for them
 is plan main jeeyo dwaara bina FUP limit analimited wais colling or 28 dinon ke liye 1GB data diya jaataa tha
 However, after the arrival of the IUC top-up voucher, customers who bought the Rs 49 plan were required to purchase the IUC top-up recharge
 haalanki ab telecomtok kii report ke mutabik is plan ko hi hataa diya gaya he
 Last week, Reliance Jio updated its tariff plans while increasing prices
 ab 49 rupee vaale plan ko bhi hataaya janaa isi kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 Also, let us tell you that since the plans of jiophone have not been updated, now the price of the plans starts at Rs 75
 pichley maheene reliance jeeyo ne jeeophone ke liye ol-in-van richarge plance ko pesh kiya tha
 Non-live minutes are also available in these plans
 ye plance 75 rupee, 125 rupee, 155 rupee or 185 rupee vaale hai
 Now in the base plan i
e
 Rs 75 plan, customers will get unlimited Jio to Jio voice calling, 500 minutes non-jio calling, 100MB data daily, total 50SMS and 28 days validity

 pramukh anshtaap bahut khush hai dobaaraa grahamantri banakar
 Last time you had to resign
 magar pavaar sahab ne aapako dobaaraa grahamantri banaakar aapaki izzat baksh di?main apni jimmedaari nibhaaoongaa
 i will try my best to do whatever is necessary to protect the people of the state
 aap apane khun kii aakhri boond bhi iske liye nyochhavar kar denge?maharashtra kii janata ke liye jo bhi nyochhavar karnaa padegaa vah main karke dikhaaungaa
 You will surrender later
 aisa lagata he ki aapke police vibhaag ke log aapako pehle nyochhavar kar denge? police vibhajit he or ek adhikari ne to yahaan tak kah diya- mere officer 26 / 11 ko bhaag gaye the?police vibhaag main vibhaajan yaa foot nahin hone denge
 Whatever officers will do this kind of work, we will not keep them in the police team and will take strict action against them
 aapke ek adhikari gafoor (mumbai ke purv police kamishnar hasan gafoor) ne kaha he ki chaar bade adhikari, jinamein se ek shahid bhi ho gaye, dar kar bhaag gaye the
 Four days before 26 / 11, do you think this statement of an officer is right? i have not seen what exactly he has said
 phir bhi isaki puri jaankaree ekatra kii jaaegi
 i would also ask ACS to investigate
 lekin maine dekha tha ki maharashtra kii police ne acha kaam kiya tha or hamaare bahut saare adhikari or jawan shahid bhi ho gaye the
 Is it not that after you become Home Minister again, big officials have come together to thwart you? i don't think so
 kis sandarbh main unhone kaha he isaki sab jaankaree ham lenge
 R
 aar
 They consider Patil a weak home minister? i have shown some work by which no one will call me weak
 main kya hum maharashtra kii janata ko mere bare main puri jaankaree he
 What have you done? i have done a lot of work for the people of Maharashtra and the police
 bade paimaane par saakaar the, nafta racket tha, mataka tha, avaidh sharaab thi inhen hamane khatm kiya
 40,000 recruits were made in the police but a Rs
 kaa bhi bhrashtachar nahin hua
 On the basis of quality, youth of poor house also got admitted in police
 aap achche grahamantri the tab aapaki chhavi aisi kyon ban gai ki aap kamjor hai, sharif hai jabaki police vibhaag ko ek damdaar aadmi chahie?duusari pari main yah bhi aapako dikhegaa
 In the Gateway of India, the poor policemen were sleeping on the road? shahid police adhikariyon kii patniyaan vinitha kaamate or kavita karkare ne aarope lagaaya he ki unke pati isliye maare gaye kyonki police adhikariyon ne apni jimmedaari nahin nibhaai?is bare main ram pradhan samiti ne apane nishkarsh die hai
 It is not right to argue over it
 hamaare bahadur adhikariyon ne jahaan janaa jaruri tha vahaan jane kii koshish kii
 Some of them also became martyrs
 main unase puri jaankaree luungaa
 You have a new challenge - Gundaraj has increased
 media or channel ke daftaron par hamale kiye gaye hai?vidhansabha main jo kuch hua uski jimmedaari grahamantri par nahin hoti
 We will not spare anyone in the attack that took place yesterday
 mumbai desh kii aarthik rajdhani he
 It is an international city
 loktantr main madhyam (media) mahatvapurn he
 We will impose non-bailable streams on those responsible for the attack on journalists
 raaj thakare ke maamle main kaha ja rahaa he ki aap unke prati naram hai
 Mild clauses are levied against them to get bail? This is a wrong charge
 hamane varisht vakeelon se baat karke dharaaen lagaai thim
 This will not happen next
 bala sahib thakare ne abhi sachin tendulkar ke bare main kaha he
 There is a competition going on
 aisa lagata he ki aapaki sarkaar bhi tay nahin kar paa rahi he ki saare maharashtriyan ko saath lekar chalanaa he yaa marathi maanush ko
 It is true that competition is going on in both of them
 isse maharashtra kii janata ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 What are you doing to ensure that 26 / 11 does not happen again? Many steps were taken last year for this
 jo bhi kamiyaan hongi unhen puri takat se dur karenge
 Security and Naxalism are top of my priority
 enesji ke aadhaar par tosk force-van banaaya gaya he
 The Quick Response Team (QRT) has also been formed
 hamaara police dal desh main sarvshereshth hoga
 What is the biggest challenge before you - hooliganism or terrorism of Shiv Sainiks? Terrorism
 in logon ko ham kabhi bhi nibata sakate hai
 We have to fight terrorism and Naxalism

 He said that the existing Bill has provisions for amendment in the Insurance Act of 1938, General Insurance Business 'nationalization' Act 1972 and Insurance Regulation and Development Authority Act 1999
 sinha ne kaha ki is vidheyak ke jariye beemaa kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii seemaa ko 26 se badhaakar 49 pratishat kiya jaayegaa
 He said that the spread of our insurance sector is very low
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam jaisi bhartiya companiyaan viraat kohli evam sachin tendulkar kii tarah vishwastareey hon
 Sinha withdrew a bill brought earlier in this regard before introducing this bill
 us vidheyak ko pravar samiti main bhej diya gaya tha
 Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said that this bill is not only related to life insurance
 unhone kaha ki hamen apane desh main swasthya beemaa, fasal beemaa jaise saadhaaran beemaa ke vibhinn kshetron ko majboot bananaa he
 He said that there is a great need of capital in the insurance sector of the country because as the insurance sector spreads in the country, money will be needed to pay claims
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya jivan beemaa saraahneey kaary kar rahi he
 Sinha said that today not one but ten companies like LIC are needed
 aisi companiyaan vishwa str par pratispardhaa karne main samarth honi chahie
 Referring to the agreement signed by the Railways with LIC, he said that if our life insurance companies are strong then we will get more investment for the basic sector
 unhone kaha ki jab hamaare sachin tendulkar or viraat kohli vishwa str par pratispardhaa kar sakate hai to elisi or jiaaisi is prakaar kii pratispardhaa kyon nahin kar sakate
 While participating in the discussion on the Bill, some members opposed the increase in FDI limit, while most members stressed the need to protect the interests of the insured
 congress ke em ve rajeev gauda ne charchaa aarambh karte hue kaha ki rajg sarkaar samprag sarkaar ke hi prayaason ko aage badha rahi he or ab vah iske daayre kaa vistaar kar rahi he
 He said that there is a need for better insurance market in the country and maximum people should be brought under its purview as about 90 percent people of the country do not have any insurance
 unhone kaha ki is vidheyak kaa laabh garib se garib ko mili ise sunishchit karnaa chaiye or beemaa utpaadon kaa vividhikaran hona chaiye
 He said that Indian ownership should be ensured by limiting the FDI limit to 49 per cent
 bhaajapa ke chandan mitra ne vidheyak kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki is vidheyak ko zyada se zyada pakshon ke saath baatcheet kar taiyaar kiya gaya he
 He said that the coverage of health insurance is still available to very few people in the country which needs to be increased and this bill is also important for expanding the reach of insurance
 mitra ne kaha ki beemaa suvidhaon ko prasar gramin kshetron main kam he or sarkaar kii is pahal se is disha main pragati hogi
 He cited the example of many developed countries where FDI up to 100 percent is allowed in the insurance sector
 samaajawaadee party ke ramgopal yadav ne kaha ki yah dharna banaai ja rahi he ki epadiai kii seemaa badhaane se beemaa kaa prasar bhi badhegaa
 They have proved the assumption that the FDI limit will increase by expanding the region
 unhone kaha ki nijee companiyaan apane laabh ke mantavya se prerit hokar desh main aayengi na ki yahaan ke saamaajik dayitvon se unka koi sarokaar hoga
 He appreciated LIC employing millions of people and said that it has a world record in claims settlement
 unhone kaha ki epadiai seemaa badhaane se videshon kii diwalia companiyaan is desh main aayengi jin par prabhavi ankush nahin hoga

 tahseen poonawala naam ke ek yuvak ne kendriya mantri ko twit kar kaha he ki mainen ek hindu ladki ko haath lagaaya he, ab aapako jo karnaa he karke dikhaaiye
 The young man has further written that this is like a challenge for you

 In which he said that if a hand touches a Hindu girl, it should not be avoided
 hegade ke is bayaan ke baad raajnneeti garma gai

 On January 2, Hegde had targeted the Kerala government over the Sabarimala temple issue and said that he compared the government's handling of the matter with Hindus on a 'day in broad day rape'
 unhone kaha tha ki jis tarah se sarkaar is maamle ko handle kar rahi he usase yah maamla ab 'hinduon se din-dahaade rape' kii tarah ho chalaa he
 Hegde had said that 'the bias of the Chief Minister, rather than the bias of the Left, is causing complete confusion in Kerala
 sarvocch nyaayalay (supreme Court) ne jo nirdesh diya he, main usase puri tarah sahamat hum
 Since law and order is a state subject, it should have been looked into

 With this, he said that the Kerala government has failed completely

 After cleaning up the central government on the CBI dispute, the Congress raised several questions in a press conference
 congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that Modi government has removed the CBI director to avoid Kirafelke's phobia
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ne desh kii sansthaaon ko ICU main dhakel diya he, sibiai kii pratishtha ko dhul main milaayaa ja rahaa he
 Today, the central government is not accepting the orders of the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki rafel ghotaale kii pole khulne se dare hue bijepi netaaon ne gujarat model centre main thope diya he
 He said that thus removing the CBI director is unconstitutional
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri modi khud sibiai ke adhikariyon ko bulaate hai or faujadaari ke maamalon main dakhal dete hai
 Whereas as Chief Minister, Modi used to talk about CBI in many ways
 upie sarkaar main affidavit dekha gaya tha to istipha maanga gaya tha
 The Congress leader said that the CVC has no authority to appoint or remove the CBI director
 CVC ke paas nayaa power kaise aa gaya? CVC keval suparvijri body he
 The CVC is misleading
 is santhaan kaa bhi durupyog kiya ja rahaa haisarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra se pare he maamalaapako bataa den ki buudhvaar ko hi vitt mantri arun jetali ne sibiai vivaad par sarkaar kaa rukh saaf kiya
 Arun Jaitley said that CBI is a prestigious institution in this country
 isaki saakh bani rahe iske liye kendra sarkaar tatpar he
 The Finance Minister said that a strange and unfortunate situation has arisen in the CBI
 do varisht diarector par sawaal uthe hai
 The director below him and the number two officer have accused the director
 isaki jaanch koun karegaa yah sarkaar ke saamne sawaal he
 It does not come under the jurisdiction of the Central Government nor will the Government investigate it

 donon kaa rishta jaise-jaise purana hota gaya vaise-vaise uski hakeekat peedita ke saamne aane lagi
 According to the victim, several cases have been registered against Manoj in Borivali and Charkop and in many of these cases the victim has saved him

 trinmul congress ke do varisht netaa mamata banerjee or mukul roy ke sambandh ab saamaanya nahin rahe
 The differences between the two leaders have now been revealed to the public
 kolkata ke kaali ghat sthiti mamata banerjee ke awaas par shanivaar ko hui baithak main bhale hi mukul roy bhi shaamil hue, lekin is baithak main shaamil sabhi netaaon ke saamne sthiti spasht thi ki didi or mukul da ke riste saamaanya nahin rahe
 The highlight of this meeting was that Mamata first invited all the leaders to speak, but when no one was ready to speak, she herself gave a speech in her style for one and a half hours
 mamata ne bijepi par aropa lagaaya ki vah mukul roy ko sibiai kii giraft main lekar unki party trinmul ko todna chaahati hai
 Actually, Mamta has given such a statement for two reasons
 pehle unhen yah andaja tha ki sibiai mukul roy ko poochtacha ke baad giraftaar karegi or mukul roy sibiai daftar jate hi didi ke style main piem modi or amit shah par hamalaa bolenge, lekin mukul roy naa to giraftaar hue naa hi unhone aisa koi bayaan diya
 This made Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee suspicious that there was a deal between Mukul Roy and BJP leaders, so on Saturday, Mamata tried to bring both Mukul Roy and BJP on the backfoot, publicizing this
 shanivaar kii baithak main mamata ne baar-baar apane ek anya saansad shubhendu adhikari kaa naam liya or kaha ki sibiai unhen bhi giraftaar karne kii koshish karegi
 This statement by Mamta also indicates that she realizes that CBI can pursue her after Mukul Roy
 mamata banerjee kii pareshaani is baat ko bhi lekar he ki mukul roy se poochtacha ke dauraan adhikansh sawaal mukhyamantri se jude hue the or kai jawaab aise rahe jisase aane vaale dinon main mamata bhi jaanch ke daayre main aa sakati hai
 Four-time champions Australia missed their maiden century in the World Cup with the help of 183 runs for the first wicket by Shane Watson (94) and wicketkeeper batsman Brad Haddin (88) at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Wednesday
 In 2011 group match, after beating Canada by seven wickets, topped Group 'A'

 watson ko shandaar pari ke liye main of da match chunaa gaya
 Earlier, seeing the way opener Heral Patel had started the innings, it seemed that Canada would be able to give world champions Australia a big target but lack of experience and good Australian bowling performance gave them 45
 4 overon main 211 ranon ke maamuli yoga par simit kar diya
 After winning the toss and batting first, the Canadian team scored 100 runs in 16 overs in the Group 'A' match due to Heral's stormy innings, but the subsequent batsmen lost the expected target from the slow game

 ) aapane 'plastic chaaval' ke bare main to suna hi hoga
 Some videos related to it are going viral these days
 soshal media par kaaphi lambey samay se bazaar main plastic chaaval kii maujuudagi ko lekar likhaa ja rahaa he
 On Tuesday, plastic rice caused a lot of panic in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh
 soshal media par afvaah udi ki kuch kiraanaa store par plastic chaaval bik rahe hai
 In fact, on Tuesday, a person from Mirpet in Telangana complained to the police about getting plastic rice at the grocery store
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki usase do din pehle hyderabad ke sarurnagar main ek customer ne biryani point par plastic ke chaaval istemaal hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 Acting on the complaint, officials of the Civil Supplies Department raided the Mirpet shop and seized rice samples and sent them to the lab for investigation
 is bich yah afvaah soshal media par fail gai ki andhra pradesh main bade str par plastic ke chaaval beche ja rahe hai
 On social media, as people shared this, the anxiety of the people increased
 plastic chaaval kii baat ne logon ke man main dar baitha diya he
 According to TOI news, the Mirpet police said that Ashok, a resident of Nandanvanam Colony, had lodged a complaint that he and his family had been suffering from stomach as well as pain in hands and feet for the last few days
 unke mutabik somvaar raat jab ve kaam se waapas ghar laute to unhone dekha ki khaane ke liye unki patni ne jochaavalaunhen parosa he vah khaane laayak nahin tha or masalaa hua sa lag rahaa tha
 Srinivas Rao, assistant food controller of the weighment department, told TOI, "we have also received information about plastic or fake rice through social networking sites
 abhi tak hamen apane aalaa adhikariyon se is sambandh main koi nirdesh nahin mili hai lekin main 4 food inspectors ko bhej kar vikhapattanam ke chaaval vyapaariyon ke chaaval kii jaanch ke liye bhej rahaa hum
 "however, the rice traders of the state rejected the talk of plastic rice and dismissed the reports as false
 ek chaaval vyapaaree ke
 Bhim Rao told TOI during an interaction with TOI, “plastic rice is not being sold in the city
 bhagwaan kii krupa se andhra pradesh main chaaval kii koi kami nahin he jisaki vajah se yahaan nakli yaa plastic chaaval bike
 "how to distinguish between real and fake (plastic) rice - Plastic rice will not smell
" - pakaane ke baad plastic chaaval se plastic kii mahak aa jaaegi
 - The real rice is easily suppressed after cooking, while the fake rice grain remains tight even when cooked
 - asli chaaval kii apeksha nakli chaaval jaldi nahin tuutata
 - Whenever bring more quantity of rice from the market, try heating a handful of rice on a pan
 isamen plastic ke chaaval pighalane lagenge
 While roasting pure rice will harden
 - aap chahen to pehle thode se chaaval banaakar iske asli or nakli kii pahchaan kar len
 a post shared by Alia (@aliaabhatt) on Jan 2, 2018 at 9:59 am PST ye pehali baar he jab bharat bina sachin tendulkar ke pakistan ke khilaaf kisi world cap mukaable main utrega
 Sachin was the man of the match in three of the 5 matches in the World Cup between the two countries so far
 pesh he world cap itihaas ke in dilachasp 5 muqablon se judi dilachasp kahaniyaan
 india-pakistan World Cup match: Sidney, 1992: After winning the toss, Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin selected the first batsman
 ravi shastri ko drop kar nae navele ajay jadeja ko apane duusare hi match main opening ke liye bheja gaya tha
 He also proved his usefulness by scoring 46 runs
 lekin pari ke hero sachin tendulkar hi rahe
 Sachin scored 54 runs and India scored 216 runs in 49 overs
 jawaab main pakistan kii shuruyaat bhi kharaab rahi or ant bhi
 Pakistan did not win despite Aamir Sohail's 62 and Javed Miandad's 40 runs
 pakistan ne apane aakhri 8 wicket to mahaj 68 ranon par kho die
 India won the match by 43 runs, but more than the result of the match, the dispute between Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More and Javed Miandad was in the news
 more kii jarurat se zyada apil se pareshaan hokar miyandad maidan par hi unki nakal karne lage or balla haath main lekar hawa main chalaang lagane lage
 The umpires reported to match referee Ted Wicks, who summoned the managers of both teams to settle the dispute
 bangalore, 1996:jameen bharat kii thi or toss bhi bharat ne hi jeeta
 Team India came out to bat first, thanks to Navjot Sidhu's brilliant 93 runs, they moved towards a strong score but Ajay Jadeja's stormy innings gave momentum to the innings
 sirf 25 gendon main jadeja ne 45 ranon kii tej pari kheli
 India scored 51 runs in the last 3 overs of the innings
 in 3 main se 2 over vakaar younus ne kiye, jisamen unhen 40 ran ganvaane pade
 India scored 287 for 8 wickets in 50 overs
 jawaab main pakistani opebers said anwar or aamir sohail ne jabardast shuruyaat kii lekin venkatesh prasad or anil kumble ne 3-3 wicket baantkar pakistan ko baikfoot par dhakel diya
 Pakistan lost this match by 39 runs
 ye match bhi apane saath ek vivaad lekar aayaa
 During Pakistan's batting, opener Aamir Sohail pointed to Venkatesh Prasad with the bat, in response Prasad bowled him to the next ball
 match ke baad pakistan main unki team ke khilaaf kaaphi virodh-pradarshan hua
 Manchester, 1999: Swords were drawn between indo-pakistan forces in Kashmir
 dar tha ki kahin maidan main bhi donon tiimon ke samarthak bhid naa jaaen, lekin hua iske thik ulat
 The two teams took to the ground in Manchester amidst the great atmosphere
 ajahar ne toss jitkar ballebaazi chuni
 When Sachin strengthened the innings early, Dravid and Azhar took the middle order and gave Team India a score of 227 for 6 wickets
 jawaab main pakistan kii team venkatesh prasad se paar nahin paa saki
 Saeed Anwar, Inzamam and Moin Khan tried hard but Pakistan only managed 180 runs between successive falling wickets
 venkatesh prasad ne 27 ran dekar 5 wicket liye or main of da match rahe
 Centurion, 2003: This was the first india-pakistan match since June 2000
 dakshin africa kii tej garmi main paara is match kii vajah se bhi badha hua tha
 Pakistan won the toss for the first time against India in the World Cup and came out to bat
 said anwar ke shandaar 101 ranon kii badaulat pakistan ne 7 wicket par 273 ran kaa score khadaa kiya
 When India got to bat, the first challenge was to overcome the trio of Wasim, Waqar and Shoaib Akhtar
 lekin aisi paristhitiyon main sachin ne is world cap kii sabase yaadgaar pari kheli
 Especially the balls of Shoaib Akhtar, which is still remembered today
 sachin jab 32 par the tab unke pair main khinchaav aa gaya, lekin iske baavjood wo date rahe or apane shatak se mahaj 2 ran pehle wo out ho gaye
 But Dravid and Yuvraj gave the team the victory
 mohali, 2011:ye worldcup kaa semifinal tha
 The Prime Minister of the two countries had arrived to watch the match
 jaahir he dabaav to tha hi
 The toss was in India's name and Dhoni chose batting first
 sahvaag ne tej shuruyaat kii or sachin ne pari ko baandhe rakhaa
 Thanks to 4 lives, one by one, Sachin hit 85 and India scored 260 for 9 wickets
 jawaab main pakistan 231 ran hi bana sakaa or bharat final main pahunch gaya
 For Pakistan, the match's perpetrators were called misbah-ul-haq, whose slow batting blamed the loss
 hamaare yahaan kai maukon par sone or chaandi kii kharidari shubh maani jaati he
 Gold is bought fiercely on Dhanteras, Diwali, Akshaya Tritiya etc
 lekin duvidha yah rahati he ki aise main sikke kharide jaaen yaa gahane
 On the occasion of festivals, many offers tempt us and by looking at the attractive designs of jewelry, it seems that this is the right choice
 lekin thodaa ruk kar sochenge or samajhadaari dikhaaenge to pataa lagegaa ki gahanon se zyada sikke khareednaa behatar rahata he
 These are the reasons that tell us how to buy gold and silver coins
 lekin jab aap vahi jewelery bechney jate hai yaa exange karte hai to yah amount aapako waapas nahin milti
 Therefore, if you want to avoid the burden of making charge, then prefer only the gold coin
 is tarah aapako tyohaar par zyada kharidari ke liye or rakam bhi mil jaaegi
 2) Never make coins with jewelery
 If you are converting gold jewelery into gold coins, biscuits or any other design, then you will get only the price of gold without a charging charge and in addition to the new design you will get the additional charge
 Have to give it apart
 lekin agar aapke paas sone kaa sikaa he to aap bina kisi nuksaan ke isse kabhi bhi jewelery banavaa sakate hai
 3) Investing beneficial investment means investing money to earn profit
 jab aap sone kii jewelery main nivesh karte hai to aapako use bechney paramankig charge kaa nuksaan hota he
 But if you have invested by buying gold coin, then if you sell it in future when the price of gold increases, then you get more value of the same coin without any loss
 4) sefti ke lihaaj se bhi phaaydasone kii jewelery ke chori hone kaa khatra zyada hota he, chaahe aap use pahanen yaa phir rakhe rahen
 At the same time, it is easy and safe to keep gold coins in a bag
 antarrashtriya mahila diwas ke maukey par mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko jald paarit kiye jane kii maang karte hue kade shabdon main sarkaar se kaha, 'hamen hamaara jaij haq do

 Initiating the first discussion on the issue of women empowerment, Sonia Gandhi underlined the role of the Congress party in the upliftment of women and said that the Congress gave the country the first woman Prime Minister, the first woman President and the first woman Lok Sabha Speaker
 unhone is baat ko bhi rekhaankit kiya ki purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke duuradrushti ke chalate hi aaj sthaneey nikaay or panchayat chunaav main 40 fisadi se adhik mahilaayein nirvaachit hui hai
 Sonia Gandhi criticized the NDA government on many issues and also questioned its slogan of 'maximum good governance and minimum government'

 ' kendriya mantri ne aage kaha, 'main aise kai logon se mila jinhone kaha ki ham bijepi or desh ke liye apana jivan samarpit karnaa chaahate hai

 In the 'samvadi' program of a Hindi newspaper, a big controversy has arisen regarding Maithili language
 us par kuch gambhir tippanee karne se pehle in tathyon ko padhaa janaa chahie:1
 In the fifties, there was a long debate between Baba Nagarjuna and Hindi critic Ram Vilas Sharma about Maithili and Rambilas Sharma was finally repulsed by Nagarjuna's arguments
 2
 The former Chief Minister of Bihar and himself the most popular leader among the people
 karpuri thakur ne san 1977 main apni mantriparishad kii taraf se prastaav bhejkar centre se maithili ko samvidhan main shaamil karne kii maang kii
 3
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ne san 1975 main maithili ko samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee main shaamil karne kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki maithili, maithili he-wo hindi nahin he
 The above mentioned quotes are from three great literary and political personalities of modern India
 sambhavat: maithili ko ‘boli’ maanane vaale akhbaar ko itihaas ke in uddharanon se behatar jawaab koi na de paae
 Well, if we talk about the present, it is true that there are many people who consider Maithili as a dialect
 maithili ko brahmanon or kaaysthon kii bhashaa maanane waalon kii sankhya bhi bahut he or iskaa kaaran he acadamiyon or sansthaanon ke tantra par inkaa varchasv
 Many Maithils consider Maithili as the language of dialects and Brahmins, which expresses socio-geographical displeasure not with Maithili
 duusari taraf wo gaiyr-maithili bhashi hai jo is chintaa main ghule rahete hai ki unki bhashaa ko samvidhan main shaamil nahin kiya gaya or maithili samvidhan kii 8veen anusuchee main shaamil ho gai
 This in fact reflects jealousy of the neighbor's progress and their own lack of hard work and reasoning
 vaise bhi bhashaa kii paribhaashaayen sankhyabal tay nahin karata, uske apane tark hote hai
 But the control of any caste or caste-group on the institutional system of a language does not make that language bad, inferior or 'spoken'
 vah sansthaanon se baahar bhi karodon logon kii abhivyakti kaa madhyam hoti he or unke dilon main dhadkati he
 It contains his idiom, his folklore, his proverbs and how many traditions he breathes
 phuko ne kahin likhaa he, 'koi bhashaa sirf samvaad kaa madhyam bhar nahin he, balki wo uski hajaaron saal ke itihaas ko sahejane kaa madhyam bhi he
 'nirmal Varma also writes,' Every word is a history! Around the world, there is a crisis in the mother tongues, especially on the low-numbered and non-ruling (!) Languages
 kam sankhya vaali adivasee bhashaaen lupt ho rahi hai or hajaaron saalon kaa gyaan va anubhav khatm hone ke kagaar par he
 'but when it comes to Maithili, it is seen not only by connecting with Maithil Brahmins and Kayasthas, but it is also considered to be the first rebellion towards Hindi in the Hindi belt
 bahut din nahin hue jab hindi ke kuch namchin or kam namvar sahityakaron ne gandhi shanti pratishthan main ek goshtee kii thi jisamen hindi pattee kii kisi bhi bhashaa ko samvidhan kii 8veen anusuchee main shaamil hone ke prati virodh jataayaa gaya tha or usamen maithili kaa naam bhi liya gaya tha
 In some people's view, Hindi is the "grand project" that can bring an integral role in this country and which our forefathers promised during the freedom struggle
 isamen shaq nahin ki aisa maanane vaale kam yaa zyada vam va dakshin donon khemon ke log hai
 This is partly true but not true either
 aadhunik hindi kaa vikaas pichhali kuch sadiyon main hua he or desh main ekatvkaari bhoomika kaa nirvaah karne main uski bhoomika ke paksh main beshak kai baaten hai jiskaa bakhaan karnaa is lekh kaa makasad nahin he
 But this does not mean that any ancient language should be viewed merely from the point of view of inferiority or contempt or rebellion that it is a part of the Hindi belt or outside it and where some castes dominate its institutions
 jaateey varchasv kamovesh har bhashaa main he or jo jatiyaan samaajik-aarthik rup se majboot hai unka bhashaaon ke saansthanik tantra par bhi varchasv he
 It is also in Tamil Nadu and in Gujarat, claiming socially vigorous progressiveness
 samay ke saath vah varchasv tut bhi rahaa he or usamen nae samooh pravesh bhi kar rahe hai
 Partly, this comparison is such that the left writer groups dominate the academies and institutions of Hindi, but because of that Hindi does not become inferior or very good
 bihar ke bhootpurv va swa
 Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur's support to Maithili has already been mentioned in this article
 usase pehle apatkaal lagane se kuch hi din pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi ne 'mithila mihir' ko die apane saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki maithili hindi nahin he, maithili to maithili hi he
 He also promised to include it in the 8th schedule of the constitution, which he followed decades later
 is saakshaatkaar ko padhakar karpuri thakur swayan bhi maithili ke paksh main saakshaatkaar dene ko raji hue the
 But unfortunately due to the emergency and censorship of the press, the interview plan was shelved
 lekin apatkaal ke baad jaise hi janata party kii sarkaar karpuri thakur ke netritv main bihar main bani, unhone pehla pramukh kaam maithili ke samarthan main centre ko patr likhane kaa hi kiya
 In the fifties, when Potti Sriramalu died for a separate Andhra Pradesh fast, the ruling class of India had a similar concern
 unhen lagata tha ki kshetreey (!) bhashaa ke aadhaar par bane rajya desh kii ekta ke liye khatra ho sakate hai kyonki kuch hi din pehle majahab ke aadhaar par desh kaa vibhaajan ho gaya tha
 But with time, that apprehension proved neutral and it came to know that 'regional language' is the real national language and all the languages of this country are in fact the national language
 alag telugu bhashi praant kaa matlab raashtra kaa vikhandan nahin tha, balki usase raashtra majboot hi hua
 Yes, it is true that Hindi progressed for its own reasons
 ye bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki jab san pachaas ke dashak main hindi ko thopane kii koshish hui, uskaa kai praanton main virodh hua-lekin san nabbe or do hajaar tak aate-aate unheen pradeshon ke log apni jaruraton kii vajah se hindi seekhney lage! duusari taraf hamaare pados pakistan or srilanka main kya hua? usee daur main unhone bangladesh main urdu thopane kii koshish kii, mahaj do dashakon main unka mulk bant gaya
 Sri Lanka tried to impose Sinhalese and Sri Lanka remained bloody for decades
 itihaas ke ye sabak bataate hai ki maatrubhaashaon par sansthagat prahaar ke nattejey thik nahin hote
 They also sow the seeds of separatism in the nation
 lekin chintaa kii baat usase aage kii bhi he
 When the sparsely populated languages all over the world and especially in India are on the verge of extinction, the words are dying out - the vernacular languages and their diversity are the greatest guarantee of saving our words
 yaad rakhie maithili jaisi bhashaaen bachi rahengi, to hindi bhi bachi rahegi
 Languages like Maithili are fixed deposits that keep languages like Hindi rich with their annual interest
 hindi ko agar dhiladhaala vishaal gathbandhan kahen to maithili jaisi bhashaaen us gathbandhan ke majboot lekin swatantra ghatak dal hai jisane bhashaaon ke is ‘global waar’ main suraksha kaa doosraa lekin majboot dhaancha banaakar rakhaa he
 Hopefully, the subject of the newspaper will understand this broader perspective

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has won a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections
 uski is jeet kaa kram jammu-kashmir ke jammu kshetra main bhi dekhne ko mila he
 BJP candidates also won the victory in two Lok Sabha seats in Jammu region
 udhampur se party ke ummidavaar or kendriya mantri dow
 Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore Sharma, both BJP candidates from Jammu Lok Sabha seat, showed mightiness in their seats by a large margin
 in donon ne 2014 se zyada antar se apane-apane pratidwandviyon ko peeche choda
 Political analysts say that even though there was an anti-incumbency against the BJP candidate from Jammu region, the Modi wave changed the electoral picture
 ek raajnneetik vishleshak kaa kahana he, 'logon ne jammu kshetra main piem modi ke liye vot kiya he na ki ummidavaar ke liye
 Despite the understanding between the Congress and the National Conference (NC) in the state, these candidates failed to defeat the BJP leaders
 donon dalon ke bich hue samjhaute main neshnal conference ne donon siton par congress ke ummidavaaron ko samarthan diya tha
 The funny thing is that the People's Democratic Party (PDP) also decided not to field anyone from here

 donon partiyon ne kaha tha ki agar dhara 370 or 35A ko haath lagaaya gaya to jammu-kashmir bharat kaa ang nahin rahegaa
 It is believed that the people of Jammu region got angry with both the parties and voted for the BJP candidate
 guuruuvaar ko rujhaan aane ke saath hi jammu kshetra main bhaajapa ke ummidavaaron ne jeet kaa jashn manaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 a party candidate in Kathua said that he was very happy with the party's big victory and also hoped that now the party will remove sections 370 and 35A
 abhi rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Among these, the BJP will have to keep its stand clear on Sections 370 and 35A or else they may have to face the displeasure of the people of Jammu region in the upcoming elections
 bhaajapa ko keval jammu kshetra main hi nahin balki ladakh kshetra main bhi phayda hua he
 BJP candidate Jamyang Tshering Namgyal from the lone Lok Sabha seat of Ladakh has also won the election

 bjp's performance in the state has been similar to 2014
 is baar bhi party ko teen siten mili hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, the Governor of the state gave the status of Division to Ladakh and also approved a University for Ladakh

 Addressing a public meeting held in Firozabad after unveiling the statue of Kargil martyr Brijlal, Akhilesh said that the youth, farmers and youth in the country are all sad and upset due to the wrong policies of BJP
 desh kii fouj par deshavaasiyon ko garv he
 Not knowing how many heroes sacrificed their lives to protect Mother India, but the BJP government has done the work of humiliating them with their politics rather than giving respect to the army
 sapa ne kiya shaheedon kaa sammansapa supremeo akhilesh ne kaha ki samaajwaadiyon ko jab bhi mauka mila unhone fouj or phogiyon ko sammaan dene kaa kaam kiya he
 When Netaji (mulayam Singh) was the defense minister, he had decided that after the martyrdom, the dead body of the soldiers would come to his house

 com / s5sec3vnk5 — Samajwadi Party (@samajwadiparty) December 7, 2018 He said that in the same way when Netaji was the Chief Minister, when the martyrs of the soldiers started giving Rs 5 lakh help from the state government, and when the government was formed again We worked to help the soldiers of the army, paramilitary and police by paying 20 lakh rupees for their families on martyrdom
 akhilesh ne kaha ki pichley saadhe chaar saal main centre kii bijepi sarkaar main sena ke 350 jawan shahid hue hai
 Before becoming Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had said that if his government is formed, he will bring 10 heads instead of one jawan's head, but what happened to Modi's promises after forming the government at the Center? He said that BJP people are now on martyrdom of soldiers Instead of discussing, the country is embroiled in a temple-mosque and hindu-muslim debate
 modi ke vaadon kaa kya huokhilesh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ahmedabad ke hira kaarobaariyon ke liye bullate train bana rahe hai lekin vah kathin paristhitiyon main desh kii raksha kar rahe hamaare javaanon ke liye bullate pruf jacket kyon nahin dete
 He said that despite the demonetization of the central government and deposited all the money in the banks, why are the soldiers not being given One Rank One Pension
 akhilesh ne kaha ki javaanon ke saath kisaan or noujvaan bhi bijepi sarkaar se bahut niraash or pareshaan hai
 Former Defense Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the BJP government is working only for the leaders of his party
 sabhi virgon ke liye koi kaam nahin kar rahi he
 It is very important to defeat BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ko samaajawaadee party hi haraa sakati he, hamen ekajute hokar har haalat main ise hataanaa hoga
 He said that the public knows that whenever the Samajwadi Party government comes, it works for farmers, poor, youth and women
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav bahut mahatvapurn he
 The farmers, unemployed, women and youth have great expectations from the Samajwadi Party, the Samajwadi Party has always helped these classes and solved their problems
 upi ke sitapur main aadamkhor ho jane ke shaq main kutton kaa encounter karne ke baad bhi bacchon par hamalon kaa silsilaa badastoor jari he
 Despite all the efforts of police, administration and forest department, the situation is not under control
 lihaaza ab prashasan ne encounter ke baad kutton ke nasbandi kii muhim chalaa di he
 But before i tell you about this sterilization, let us know that what is the opinion of the administration itself about the slaughter of 14 children? After all, who is this murderer? From loudspeakers to Sitapur in Sitapur these days, the district administration is making announcements through loudspeakers by taking firefighting dogs
 jisamen logon ko kutton se bachane kii salaah di gai he
 Measures have been stated
 bacchon ko gharon main rakhane kii baat kahi gai he
 You have been asked to be careful
 sari koshishen naakamamahine bhar se mashkaqt kii ja rahi he
 a team of 164 officers has been hired
 van vibhaag, police or anya export kii timen is maamle ko lekar kaam kar rahi hai
 Despite this, 14 children have died
 50 se zyaada sandigdh aaropee kutton kaa encunter kiya gaya he
 But the result of Operation 'dog' is visible only
 sitapur main hamalavar koun?camere se baahar nikal kar sitapur main sandigdh aadamkhor kutton ko lekar prashasan kitna sanjeeda hai, ye jaanane ke liye in teen baton ko dekhnaa or samajhnaa jaruri hai, kyonki inhen teen baton ke jariye aap samaj sakenge ki sitapur main bacchon par hamalaa karne vaala aakhir he koun? kutta
 
 
 Wild dog, wolf or someone else? DM issued by a press DM of Reeljasitapur or DM has put up posters in the villages of Sitapur, where suspected man-eating dogs have the highest terror
 sitapur kii dm kii hi taraf se jari press relij main janata tak soochna pahunchane kii guzarish ki gai he
 And at the same time, an institution related to the rights and protection of animals has also emerged
 jis sanstha kaa zikr khud dm ne apni press relies main bhi kisia he
 Administration has released the poster
 Now let us start with the poster
 is poster main saaf-saaf likhaa he ki sitapur or uske aasapaas ke gaanvon main jo bachche maare gaye yaa ghayal hue un sabake peeche junglee kutton kaa haath he
 They are wild dogs, who are attacking children
 poster ke madhyam se in junglee kutton se saavdhaan rahane ke tamaam upaay bhi logon ko bataae gaye hai
 Now consider this press release after only the wild dogposter responsible for the attack
 17 may ko jari is press relies me dm ne daawa kiya he ki sitapur janapad main ab tak bacchon par hamale kii jitani bhi ghatnaayen hui hai, unke liye sirf or sirfjunglee kutehi jimmedaar hai
 This is not the work of a wolf or any other animal
 dm ne diya sanstha kaa havalapane daawey ke saath jiladhikari ne baqayada press relies main ek sanghathan kaa hawala bhi diya he
 He says that the Wildlife Institute of India and the Human Society of India have made it clear that the attackers are none other than wild dogs
 sanstha ne jataai aapattimgar usee human sosayadi of india kii taraf se ek patr jari kiya gaya he
 Which has been mentioned by the District Magistrate
 jiladhikari ke press relies jari karne ke agle din hi human sosayadi of india ne unhen patr likh kar baqayada aapatti jataate hue kaha he ki unhone kabhi bhi aisa nahin kaha ki bacchon par hamalaa karne vaale junglee kute hi hai
 By the negligence of the administration, by now you must have understood that how is the Sitapur administration investigating the case of suspected man-eating dogs? You must have also known that despite throwing all the strength, why are the people here still unable to get rid of this panic? Question on UP Police? The amazing thing is that till today the team of Sitapur is different
 When we reached the villages, we could not see any police team patrolling anywhere
 logon ko kahana tha ki kai baar to aisa bhi hua ki koi kutta dikhaai diya to log khud uske peeche lathi-danda lekar bhaage
 While the policemen stood behind the people like spectators
 vaise iske liye upi police ko jimmedaar tehraana bhi shaayad thik nahin hoga

 So stay confident and protect yourself from the dark shadow of 'breakup'
 jaruri nahin ki sapanom kaa humsafar aapako itani jaldi mil jaae
 Chill because breakup also has benefits
 ye rahe 10 phaayde:1: man kii safai he guru:brallep to dost bhaawanaaon ke bartan kaa saaf ho janaa he, ki angreji main jise 'katharsus' (catharsis) kehete hai
 The old silt deposited in the mind is removed and a fertile ground is prepared, so that fresh feelings are stirred up
 baadh ke baad kii mitti ho jaise
 2
 yaari he imaan meraa:brallep vah prasthaan bindu he jiske baad aapako nae sire se apane doston kii ahmiyat samaj aati he
 It seems that your friends are very sweet and till now you kept ignoring them
 unke saath bitaayaa gaya samay bad jaataa he or dur kahin hill stesan par gum aane kii planning bhi ho jaati he

 You are no longer liable to anyone for telling your moment-to-moment situation
 4
 Occupation of constipation will disappear: You will find that after the breakup the stomach is clean, which is a medicine of every pleasure
 wo aise ki aapke pet ko ab baahar ke 'anhaijinic' khaane se nipatane kii jarurat nahin padati
 Choumin, pastries, ice cream, gol gappas and chili pattas are no longer in your way

 Relaxation is a strange thing: No more needing to reply to messages while sleeping on the bed

 Relaxation is a strange thing, sleep covering the mouth

 Sanjay Singh and Kumar Vishwas met the MLA Vinod Kumar Binny on Tuesday night
 teen ghante tak chali baithak ke baad binni bole- 'main nahin tha naaraaz, sab thik he
 Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay Singh went to Binny's house in Vasundhara Enclave to meet her
 baatcheet ke baad teenon ne kaha ki sab thik he
 There is no tension in the party
 teenon ne saare vivaad kaa thikra media ke sir phod diya
 i had to go to the wedding, so it turned out early: Binnyanjaya Singh said, 'all this has been shown by the media
 party main aisa koi tanaav nahin he
 Kumar Vishwas said, "vinod Binny never said that he has to become a minister, there has been no rebellion in the party, all is normal
" sab galatfahami media ne failaai he
 If the party gives him a post, Binny will decide whether he has to take it or not
 'puri shaam drama karne ke baad vinod kumaar binni ne kaha, 'aisi koi samasya nahin he or na hi main naaraaz hum
 Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay Singh are like my elder brothers
 ham logon ne bas saamaanya baatcheet kii jo ki ham akasar kiya karte hai
 i attended the meeting in the evening for 10 minutes because i had some work to do
 mujhe ek shaadi main janaa tha, jiske baad main der se lautaa hum
 'binny was not angry, he did not ask for the post: Arvind Kejriwal also denied any resentment in the party before he left for the Janata Durbar to be held at the party office in Kejriwal Budhwar
 unhone kaha, 'vah naaraaz nahin the
 came to me
 lekin unhone koi pad nahin maanga
 Later, when news of their displeasure came, Kumar and Sanjay went to ask them
 lekin unhone kaha ki vah naaraaz nahin hai
 Asked on the news of differences in Congress over support to AAP, Kejriwal said that this is his problem, not ours
 ham sarkaar muddon par bana rahe hai
 You will remember that earlier the Congress was giving unconditional support and the BJP was ready to support the issues
 hamaare to ye 18 mudde hai
 The MLA who agrees will support
 hamaara kisi se gathbandhan nahin he
 Neither has any interaction with anyone
 jo dilli ke logon ke liye kaam karnaa chaahate hai, ve saare samarthan karenge
 'important decisions will be taken with formation of government, Kejriwal said that some of his important decisions will be taken soon after formation of government
 unhone kaha ki 700 litre pani ko 24 ghante ke bheetar muft kar diya jayega, lekin ghar-ghar pahunchane main thodaa vakt lagegaa
 He admitted that the possibility of his swearing in on the 26th is unlikely as the letter from LG has not arrived yet
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aap 26 ko shapath lenaa chaah rahe the to kejariwal ne kaha, '26 ko ham nahin aap chaah rahe the
 Came in the media
 ' kejariwal ne kaha tha ki taarikh tay hone par anna ko nyauta diya jayega
 Significantly, the names of potential ministers of Kejriwal cabinet came out in the media on Tuesday evening
 mantriyon kii list main jagah nahin milane ke baad vinod binni ne mangalvaar shaam ko kejariwal se mulaakaat kii
 The two talked for less than 10 minutes
 is choti-si meeting ke baad binni jab baahar aae, to khaase naaraaz dikh rahe the

 Ashok Gupta, a very disturbed citizen of Delhi, came to change one day
 parivartan ek enjio he jiskaa gathan hamane 2000 main shashan main paardarshita or javabdehi sunishchit karne ke liye kiya tha
 Gupta had not received an electricity connection for two years as he refused to bribe the Delhi Electricity Board officials
 hamane unhen dilli sarkaar ke navaprabhavi soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) kanoon ke tahat aavedan karne kii salaah di
 Delhi government implemented RTI in 2001, four years before the central government
 artiai kii shakti aajamaane kaa yahi mauka tha
 Gupta wanted to know through the RTI the names of the officers of Delhi Electricity Board who were sitting pressing their application
 unhen naam to nahin mili, lekin unke yahaan bijli kaa conection turant lag gaya
 This showed me the benefits of empowering citizens
 main lambii chuttee par chalaa gaya or artiai ke liye jor-shor se abhiyaan chalaane laga or farvari, 2006 main sarkari naukari chhod di
 Meanwhile, the Center enacted the RTI Act in June 2005
 artiai ke liye deshbhar main lambey samay tak chale abhiyaan main activist aruna roy ne sabase mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 It took us three decades to implement the Right to Information after it was legally recognized
 san 1975 main supreme court ne rajanarayan banaam uttar pradesh rajya ke maamle main faisla diya tha ki abhivyakti ke adhikaar main soochna kaa adhikaar antarnihit he
 After this many movements started
 pehla andolan '90 ke dashak ke shuru main majdoor-kisaan shakti sanghathan ne roy ke netritv main rajasthan ke gaanvon ke khaaton main paardarshita laane ke liye chalaaya
 In the mid-'90s, Anna Hazare led the movement in Maharashtra
 tamilnadu pehla rajya tha jisane 1997 main artiai kanoon lagu kiya
 After this, other states implemented their own RTI laws
 artiai kanoon ke rup main saamaanya logon ko ek shashakt or kargar aujaar mil gaya he
 Activists and ngos have been using RTI to question government policies and their implementation
 isane adhikariyon kii neend haraam ho gai he
 The government now believes that it has created a big problem for itself in the form of RTI, which is disrupting the work of general governance
 darasal, adhikari filon par kuch likhane or faisle lene se bachane lage hai
 Initially intelligence agencies and central police organizations like IB, RAW, Revenue Intelligence and Enforcement Directorate were exempted from this
 lekin ab kai anya agenciyaan bhi apane ko is kanoon ke daayre se baahar rakhane kii maang kar rahi hai
 Recently the CBI and the Income Tax Department's Investigation Branch got an exemption from this
 khufia ikaayiyon ko artiai se alag rakhaa ja saktaa he, lekin jaanch shakhaon ko bilkul nahin
 RTI has the power to crack down on government agencies
 isliye ve sabhi iskaa virodh kar rahi hai
 RTI is yet to achieve its full potential
 samasya yah he ki apane rajnatik aakaaon ke prati nishthavan soochna ayukta isaki raah main roda bane hue hai
 The RTI Act can achieve its full potential only when neutral and impartial people are appointed as Information Commissioners and Chief Information Commissioners

 bharat dwaragni-5 missile kaa pareekshankiye jane parchinaki communist party ke prabhaavshaalee akhbaar global times ne kaha ki bharat ko apni takat kaa zyada akalan nahin karnaa chahie
 Although he has missiles that can reach most parts of China, this does not mean that he will get any benefit from being arrogant during a dispute with China
 china ke saath vivaad vaale deshon par hamalon ke liye jane jane vaale dainik ne kaha ki bharat ko yah spasht ho janaa chahie ki china kii parmaanu shakti zyada majboot evam vishwasaneey he
 In an editorial titled 'india Being Swept Away by Military Delusion', the newspaper said that India will have no opportunity for the foreseeable future
 isane kaha ki bharat ko apane pashchimi sahyogiyon ke mahatv ko bhi zyada nahin maananaa chahie or ise china ke saath sanyam baratkar laabh mil saktaa he
 If it matches China's long-range tactical missiles with capability and outpaces hostilities, it could be its big mistake
 akhbaar ne kaha ki bharat missile praudyogiki ke vikaas main teji se aage badha he
 The newspaper said that it (india) had successfully tested Agni-4, which hit a distance of 3500 km last year
 bhartiya janamanas lambey samay se apane sainya vikaas ke liye china ko apane sandarbh bindu ke rup main dekhtaa rahaa he
 It has been alleged in the editorial that India does not seem to have faced many obstacles in the way of increasing its military strength
 bharat ab bhi garib he or aadharbhoot dhaanche ke nirmaan main kaaphi peeche he, lekin iskaa samaaj parmaanu shakti ke vikaas kaa jabardast samarthak he or pashchim bharat dwaara parmaanu evam missile niyantran sandhiyon kaa ulanghan kiye jane par dhyaan nahin detaa
 Without mentioning China's own US $ 106 billion defense budget this year, the newspaper said that the West remains silent on the fact that India's military is spending 17 percent more on the defense budget in 2012, and the country is back in the world
 Has become the largest importer of arms
 global times ne apane sampadakeey main kaha ki china or bharat ko jahaan tak sambhav ho sake, mithravat sambandh viksit karne chahie

 loksabhaa chunaav main kharaab pradarshan ko lekar congress party kii punjab ikai main antarkalah charam par he
 Former state chief minister and member of the Congress Working Committee Capt Amarinder Singh alleged that state Congress president Pratap Singh Bajwa and his brother Fateh Bajwa tried to disrupt his election campaign in Amritsar and by visiting the city the people Was asked to protest
 amritsar se saansad chune gaye amarinder ne kaha ki is kram main unhone fateh ko phone kiya tha or use amritsar main unke prachaar ke saath chhedchhad karne ke khilaaf chetavanee di thi
 At the same time, he said that he was still silent in the party's interest, but some leaders were now forced to disclose this due to being targeted without cause and being accused despite no wrongdoing
 unhone anushaasanamak karrwai cameti ke chairman jike chatarath se sawaal kiya he ki kya vah pradesh congress pradhan or uske bhai par is harakat ke liye koi karrwai karenge
 Captain Amarinder alleges that both the Bajwa brothers had come to Amritsar during the election campaign and asked the people not to oppose them or at least not support them
 jis bare main pataa chalane par unhone usee vakt fateh bajva ko phone kiya tha or un donon bhaaiyon ko amritsar se duuri banaae rakhane ke liye kaha tha
 He said that these two brothers stayed in Amritsar for a long time
 fateh kaa kahana tha ki vah aaraam kar rahe hai, jabaki uskaa bhai gurdaspur main he, jo vastav main amritsar main hi the
 Captain Amarinder also took a jibe at Chatrath, who made claims for enforcing discipline in the State Congress Committee, and asked if he would take such action against the Bajwa brothers as he tried to do against the two PCC vice-presidents
 rajya ke is purv mukhyamantri ne chatarath ko yah tark dekar na bachane kii salaah di ki 2004 main unhone mukhyamantri rahete hue punjab main ai do siton ke baad istipha kyon nahin diya tha
 The first thing in this sequence, as chairman of the disciplinary action committee, he cannot become a party himself by asking such questions, which steps can be overshadowed by him
 duusari baat yah he ki kaise chatarath jaan sakate hai ki 2004 ke nateezon ke baad kya hua tha or unke (captain amarinder) or congress adhyaksha sonia gandhi ke bich kya baatcheet hui thi? Captain Amarinder said that Chatrath's words and actions are clearly showing whom he is following
 vah apane shabdon par bane rahen, jab tak yah galat na sabit ho jaaen

 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne jammu-kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm kiye jane kii unki maang kii rajya ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla kii ore se kii gai aalochana par unhen salaah di ki vah ‘dhokhe or chal’ jaise shabdon kaa prayog nahin karen
 He clarified that his party has always been opposed to Article 370
 unhone apni naveenatam blog posting main kaha, yahaan tak ki jawaharlal nehru or kuch anya netaaon ko chhodkar congress party bhi jammu kashmir ko vishesh darja die jane kii kadi virdohi thi
 Advani, referring to the autobiography of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, said that even he was against Article 370, but due to Nehru's respect, he held back his views
 adwani ne apane blog main kaha, ‘‘rajya ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ko jammu-kashmir se sambandhit maamalon par bhaajapa se asahmat hone kaa puraa adhikaar he
 But i would advise him never to use offensive language and words like 'deception or deceit'
 ’’ Advani recently said that Article 370 should be abolished
 abdulla ne is par adwani kaa naam liye bina ‘‘bevajaah nirastikaran kaa mudda oochhaalane’’ ke liye unki ninda kii thi
 Describing the use of words like 'deception' and 'deceit' as 'highly inappropriate and derogatory' for the bjp's stand on the issue, Advani said that his party was not only articulate and adamant since the birth of the Jana Sangh in 1951
 It is an issue for which the founder president of the party sacrificed his life
 ’ Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was arrested in 1952 in Jammu and Kashmir when he tried to enter the state without a permit which was required to go there at that time
 kaid ke dauraan unki kathith taur par rahasyamay paristhitiyon main maut ho gai thi
 "from the time of our first all-india session in Kanpur, we have been demanding full integration of Jammu and Kashmir in India," Advani said
 ’’ unhone kaha, abdulla ko pataa hona chahie ki jab jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya gaya tha to tab jansangh kii sthapana bhi nahin hui thi
 The BJP leader said, "however, if there was any provision in drafting the constitution against which almost the entire Congress party was there, it was that provision
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘samvidhan ko purna rup se sweekaar karne se keval do maheene pehle is mudde par samvidhan sabha ne 1949 main vichaar kiya tha
 '' congress or abdulla kii neshnal conference rajya tathaa centre main gathbandhan sahyogi hai
 Referring to the book 'my Reminiscences of Sardar Patel' written by Sardar Patel's personal secretary v Shankar, Advani said that Nehru had finalized the draft with Omar Abdullah's grandfather Sheikh Abdullah before going on a foreign trip
 tippaniyan Nehru left it to his fellow Congress leader Gopalaswami Iyengar to defend it before the Congress Parliamentary Party
 unhone kaha ki sardaar patel is vichaar ke viruddh the lekin baad main vah is par aage bade
 However, on the stiff opposition from Congress members who shouted down even Maulana Azad on the issue, Patel said that "a temporary approach can only be made due to" international complications "
 unhone apni naveenatam blog posting main kaha, yahaan tak ki jawaharlal nehru or kuch anya netaaon ko chhodkar congress party bhi jammu kashmir ko vishesh darja die jane kii kadi virdohi thi
 Advani, referring to the autobiography of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, said that even he was against Article 370, but due to Nehru's respect, he held back his views
 adwani ne apane blog main kaha, ‘‘rajya ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ko jammu-kashmir se sambandhit maamalon par bhaajapa se asahmat hone kaa puraa adhikaar he
