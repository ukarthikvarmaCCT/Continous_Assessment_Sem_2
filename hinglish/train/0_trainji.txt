 "what about the Grand Alliance?" Significantly, since the Karnataka elections, there were reports of an alliance between the Congress and the BSP in Madhya Pradesh

 What is a good habit? He is a very good father
 ye mujhe se bahut laad-pyaar karte hai
 This habit is beneficial for me
 kya ye din main do baar dikhaai de jate hai?nahin, dilli main rahete hai to phone par jarur baat karte hai
 Shatrughan - i stay in Delhi or anywhere in Patna or India and abroad, there is never a weekend to spend with children and family
 inaki buree aadat kya he?ab koun-si bataaun?mummy or papa main acha koun he?mere khyaal se papa kyonki laad-pyaar to yahi karte hai
 Mommy keeps scolding where necessary, Mommy is my biggest critic

 As a child, my twin sons Luv and Kush were very similar
 sonakshi sabase choti thi
 If Sonakshi had a fight with a brother, Sonakshi used to complain to me that brother had killed me when i returned home

 Losing 30 kg of weight in a year is really worth it
 sonakshi-pehle mummy ke manaa karne par mujhamen vidroh kii bhaavana aa jaati thi or main vajan kam karne kii koi koshish nahin karti thi
 But when Mama stopped refusing, the feeling of weight loss woke up in my mind

 (from Shatrughan) Why didn't you promote sons in films? People ask me how Shatrughan Sinha allowed his daughter to appear in films? i am a modern thinking man
 jab bete filmon main aa sakate hai to beti kyon nahin
 In which case the daughter is inferior to the sons, rather he is ahead of the sons in every respect

 (from Shatrughan) The best actress of your time? Aishwarya Rai, like Amitabh has all the qualities in his personality

 The Geeta Jayanti Festival held in Haryana last year made a lot of headlines
 ek baar phir ab ye mahotsav charchaa kaa vishay bana he
 It has been revealed through an RTI that the Haryana government purchased about 3 copies of 10 Geeta copies
 8 lakh rupee kaa kharchaa kiya he
 That is, a total of Rs 38,000 was spent on buying a book of Bhagavad Gita
 khulaase ke baad ek baar phir khatter sarkaar sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Let us tell you that in this festival held last year, the Haryana Government had spent Rs
 15 crores
 ye mahotsav 25 november se 5 disambar ke bich manaaya gaya tha
 Haryana INLD leader Dushyant Chautala has also targeted the government on this revelation
 unhone kaha ki gita kii kapiyaan kaaphi saste daam par online or ofline uplabdh hai

 com / iuysvq3di4— Dushyant Chautala B- (@dchautala)january 7, 2018artiai main khulaasa hua he ki is mahotsav main parform karne ke liye bijepi saansadon ko bhi pement kii gai thi
 20 lakh was given to Hema Malini and Rs 10 lakh to Manoj Tiwari
 chautaala ne aarope lagaaya ki piem modi kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf zero tolerance rakhti he
 But his mps are also being paid so much for religious programs
 unhone bataaya ki chautaala or hooda sarkaar ne is mahotsav ko maatr kuch lakh rupee main yojit kiya tha, lekin khatter sarkaar ne isapar karodon kharch kiye hai
 He said that we will appeal to the CAG for investigation in this matter
 artiai ke mutabik, ek karod rupee brahm sarovar kii marammat main kharch kiye gaye, haalanki 2016 main hi 38 lakh rupee isi kaam ke liye pehle hi kharch ho chuke the
 Chautala alleged that the government has given awards only to its fans
 haalanki, is maamle main rajya sarkaar main mantri anil vij ne kaha ki gita mahotsav kaaphi shandaar kaarykram tha
 If there is any wrongdoing in this case, we will investigate and take strict action against the guilty officers
 rajyasabha kii visheshadhikaar samiti ne purv vitt mantri arun jetali ke phone tanping ke maamle main dilli police ko aropiyon ke khilaaf chal rahe kanoonee karrwai ko gambhirthapurvak aage le jane ko kaha he, taaki aaropee ko sajaa di ja sake
 The Privileges Committee has asked the Delhi Police to inform the committee about the progress of the case
 ye maamla 2013 kaa he jab arun jetali rajyasabha main bijepi ke netaa the
 The Rajya Sabha's Privileges Committee, in its report tabled in the Rajya Sabha, said that illegally taking mps' phone call records is a breach of privilege if it disrupts the work of the MP
 bataa den ki samiti ne apni pichhali report main kol data record ko avaidh tareeke se hasil karne ko visheshadhikaar kaa hanan nahin bataaya tha, lekin tab report kaa kai saansadon ne virodh kiya tha
 Subsequently, the Specialty Committee remodeled the report
 panel ne dilli police ke kamishnar kii raay suni or atorni general kii raay bhi is maamle par lee
 After examining the matter, the panel came to the opinion that it would be considered a breach of privilege if there is an obstruction in the parliamentary business of illegally acquiring the phone call records of the existing members of Parliament
 saath hi is kadam ko aapraadhik kanoon ke tahat niztaa kaa bhi ulanghan mana jayega
 Let us know that in 2013, notice of breach of privilege was given by some members of Rajya Sabha in the case of monitoring and surveillance of Arun Jaitley's phone
 rajyasabha kii visheshadhikaar samiti ne isi maamle main apni report saunpi he or dilli police ko puri gambhirtha ke saath cese ko adaalat main follow karne ko kaha he

 adaalat ne apane pita asaram kii tarah bete narayan sai ko surat kii do bahanon se rape ke maamle main doshi qaraar de diya
 In this case, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment
 saath hi us par ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya he
 That is, both father and son have been imprisoned for their entire life
 kabhi aaleeshaan ashramon main asaram or narayan sai bhakton ko naitikta ke lambey lambey pravachan diya karte the
 Asaram danced on the stage, his son Narayan Sai also danced with him and used to dance his hypocrisy in front of the devotees
 lekin kisi ko kya pataa tha ki jis ashram ko bhakt mandir samajhate hai or jis asaram or narayan sai ko wo bhagwaan samajhate hai
 He is not a teacher, but a teacher
 kareeb 11 saal puraane maamle main surat kii seshans court ne do bahanon se rape ke maamle main narayan sai kaa hisaab kitaab kar diya
 In which case the court has ruled
 wo surat kii rahane vaali do bahanon se judaa hua he
 These sisters accused Narayan Sai of rape
 police ne peedit bahanon ke bayaan or lokation se mili sabooton ke aadhaar par narayan sai or asaram ke khilaaf cese darj kiya tha
 It took a lot of effort to get the police to punish Narayan Sai
 rape peedit choti bahan ne apane bayaan main narayan sai ke khilaaf thos saboot hone kii baat kahi thi
 The police investigated every location
 jiskaa zikr peedit ladkee ne apni shikaayat main kiya tha
 While the elder sister had filed a case against Asaram
 do bahanon se rape ko lekar asaram ke khilaaf gandhinagar ke court main maamla chal rahaa he
 The court has so far recorded statements of 53 witnesses against Narayan Sai, including many important witnesses
 jinhone narayan sai ko ladakiyon ko apane havas kaa shikaar banaate hue dekha tha
 Or they had helped the accused in this disgusting work
 lekin baad main ye sabhi gavaah ban gaye
 In the case of throwing dust in the eyes of devotees, if Father Asaram was a number
 to uskaa betaa das numberi tha
 As soon as an FIR was registered in the case of rape on Narayan Sai
 vaise hi wo underground ho gaya tha
 He kept dodging the police for a long time
 is dauraan wo lagaataar apane thikaane badalakar police ko gumraah karata rahaa
 At that time Surat Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana had formed 58 different teams to arrest Narayan Sai and gave full force to find Narayan Sai
 rape kaa maamla darj hone ke kareeb do maheene baad narayan sai disambar, 2013 main narayan sai haryana-dilli seemaa ke paas se giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Narayan Sai disguised a Sikh man at the time of his arrest
 narayan sai ne bhi baap kii tarah paakhand kaa mayajaal bun rakhaa tha
 He used to trap people in the spread of Asaram and make them a victim of their lust
 asaram kii karatuut narayan sai ko pataa thi
 And Asaram also knew what his son was feeding in his ashram
 kanoon ke shikanje main aane ke baad bhi narayan sai apni harkaton se kabhi baj nahin aayaa
 While in jail, he also allegedly tried to pay a bribe of Rs 13 crore to a police employee
 haalanki is maamle main narayan sai jamaanat par he
 But in the case of rape, it was proved in the court that like Asaram, Narayan Sai is also a rapist and vicious like his father

 BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha is known for his open and outspoken statements on the party line
 baat chaahe bihar chunaav kii ho yaa jeenyu maamle main kanhaiya kumaar kii
 The idea of 'bihari Babu' has always troubled a section of the party and Sinha himself accepts this problem
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main unhone apni baat rakhte hue kaha ki agar unke istife se party kaa bhala hota he to vah iske liye bhi taiyaar hai
 Shatrughan Sinhay once again reiterated that BJP is his first and last party
 vah kehete hai, 'mujhe jo baat sahi lagati he, main jarur kahata hum
 This is why i supported Kanhaiya
 'maanavtaa or satya ke aadhaar par samarthanavah kehete hai, 'pehle to aapke madhyam se ye saaf kar duun ki bijepi meri pehali or aakhri party he
 As a strong party worker and leader of the party, i have full faith in the laws of India, the Constitution of India and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ab main kahana chaahunga ki kanhaiya ko lekar maine jo twit kiya, wo maanavtaa or satya ke aadhaar par kiya he
 My basis is the decision of the High Court in which Kanhaiya has got a bail
 ''main kanhaiya ko jaanata bhi nahin'shatrughna sinha ne kaha, 'jahaan tak kanhaiya kii baat he to main use jaanata bhi nahin
 Never even got lekin maine jo kuch dekha, padhaa or suna, kuch aisi hi baat rahul gandhi ne bhi kahi
 There was no anti-national or non-constitutional matter heard anywhere
 ''twit angreji main tha shaayad samaj nahin paae'bihar main bijepi netaaon sinha ke istife kii maang kii gai he
 On this, he says, 'if the people of Bihar BJP have demanded our resignation, there can be three reasons for this
 unako shaayad angreji thik se nahin aati ho, kyonki meraa twit angreji main tha
 The second reason may be that they did not understand the tweet and the third thing may be that the Khizian cat pillar is showing the saying 'wale'
 ''shotgan' ne kaha, 'wo log jo khud hi party se nikalne kii halaat main pahunch chuke hai, jo bijepi kii itani sharmnaak haar dilaane ke jimmedaar hai, wo log meraa istipha maang rahe hai
 The man who has been in the party for so many years, who has not spoken against the party till date, who has not violated the Laxman Rekha till date, wants to divert little attention by demanding the resignation of Bihari Babu
 'kanhaiya kii body language badi acchhee he'bijepi saansadane jeenyu chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya ke bhaashan or body language kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, 'I have heard that people have praised Kanhaiya's speech, but if i say as an artist, i like his body language very much
 uske andar jo energy hai agar uskaa istemaal agar sahi dhang se ho to uske bheetar gajab kaa aatmavishvaas he
 He added, 'I was watching her interview with Rajdeep Sardesai till date
 usne sawaalon kaa jawaab kaaphi achche se diya
 He spoke with respect, with respect and with depth, with no fumble or nervousness, speaking like a mature speaker and person
 ham chahenge ki wo positive kaam karte hue bihar or desh ko gauravanvit kare
 "the court will decide on the traitor and patriot" On Saturday, Amit Shah targeted Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi in Mathura
 is par shatrughna sinha ne kaha, 'hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh ne kuch kah diya he to ab us par kuch bhi kahana vivaad khadaa karnaa hoga
 But secondly, the matter is now with the court and who is a traitor and who is not, what is true and what is not true, the police, you or we will not decide
 iskaa faisla adaalat karegi
 As long as this matter is in court, we all should keep quiet on this
 ''bijepi bataae meraa kasoor kya'party ke logon prati apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue sinha ne kaha, 'main party ke khilaaf bilkul nahin hum
 People started speaking against me, so i tweeted something
 varanaa mere paas koi pad nahin he, koi pojishan nahin he
 i don't even know if i will be in the next National Executive or not
 iske liye mujhe koi shikaayat nahin
 That is why i did not attend the party
 'unhone aage kaha, 'ek din main party ko chhod duungaa yaa party mujhe nikaal degi
 Why brother what is my fault maine kiya kya he, aaj tak maine jo bhi baaten kahi hai, usamen kuch bhi party ke khilaaf nahin he
 If you look at it, you will find that whatever things i have said are in the interest of the party
 maine wo bihar or desh ke prati kahi he
 No one can point a finger at my patriotism or my love for the motherland, i am a very loyal man of my party
 bijepi meri pehali or aakhri party he
 "if my resignation is better then i am ready," Sinha, who is angry for not giving prominence as BJP leader in Bihar elections, said, despite all my efforts people decided not to call me in Bihar elections, its He had to suffer such a big brunt that he might not be able to forget his lifetime
 lekin kya mujhe iskaa dukh nahin, is baat kii takalif nahin he
 We lost the winning bet
 sirf kuch logon kii mahatvakankshaon kii vajah se
 Some of them even talked about my resignation
 agar mere istife se party kaa bhala hota he to main bilkul aapke saamne khadaa hum
 On the question of himself joining Amit Shah's new team regarding elections in 'woh Raja Hum Ranka' five states, Shatrughan said, 'woh Raja Hain Hum Ranka'
 wo tay karen
 We cannot ask, they are donors and there are three characteristics of the donor
 yaa to wo de, yaa naa de, yaa dekar waapas le le
 Amitabh Bachchan also said that he is the king, we are the raks

 Karnataka Chief Minister k Siddaramaiah is again embroiled in a new controversy
 is baar soshal media par unki nai esayuvi kharidne ko lekar hangaamaa machaa he
 It is being told that he bought this new car only because the crow sat on his old SUV
 is baat ko apshakun maanakar unhone nai car kaa order de diya
 Siddaramaiah, who was caught in controversies after taking the watch worth Rs 70 lakh earlier, was caught in a watchgift worth seventy seven million, this time due to crow
 'bengaluru mirar' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik andhvishwaas virdohi kanoon ke samarthak rahe siddharmaiya kii car kharidne kaa order kannada media or soshal media main chaaya hua he
 Because this amount will be deducted from the pocket of common taxpayers
 nai car kharidne se sarkaar ko 35 lakh rupee kii chapatrajya sarkaar kii ore se siem ke liye naifortuner top model car orderbhi kar di gai he
 In this way, the Karnataka government has incurred a loss of 35 lakh rupees by sitting on a crow's car
 is maheene kii shuruyaat main do june ko car par kauwa baithne ke baad order jari kiya gaya tha
 This decision is seen as a 'u-turn' in Karnataka's political circles
 siem awaas main lagi car par baith gaya tha kauwamukhyamantrike sarkari awaas 'krishna' main park kii hui car par kaua dekha gaya tha
 The staff at CM Housing tried to drive the crow away, but he did not budge
 maamle ko lekar sthaneey electronic media main kaaphi bahes hui
 The old anti-superstition statements of CM Siddaramaiah were also brought out
 kauwe ko bataaya rajya sarkaar kii dikkaton kii vajahausi dauraan rajya sarkaar ke saamne sarkari karmchaariyon keehadtaal kii chunautikhadi ho gai or police waalon ne samuhik chuttee kii dhamkee di thi
 Meanwhile, the chief minister's close friends linked the incident of crow sitting on the car to bad luck
 saath hi unhen gaadi badalane kii salaah de daali
 CM did the same
 bhale hi pehle unhone is tarah ke andhvishwaas kaa khuleam makhul udaaya ho
 In the case of raven on the cmo's refusal to change the car due to crows, the Chief Minister's Office has denied the reason for changing the car
 siemo se jari ek bayaan ke mutabik, maujuuda gaadi teen saal puraani ho gai thi
 Therefore it was necessary for the Chief Minister to buy a new car
 iske peeche or koi vajah nahin he
 Bollywood superstar Salman Khan is fiercely promoting India
 pramotion ke silsile main salmaan reality dance sho super dancer 3 ke set par bhi pahunche
 On the show here, Salman Khan 'katrina Kaif' was 'insulted'
 darasal, katrina caff ne ek koreographer kii tarif kii jisane unke saath thags of hindustaan ke liye kaam kiya tha
 In return, the choreographer also praised Katrina's hard work
 katrina caff ne thags of hindustaan ke gane 'suraiya' ke ek dance stant ke liye takreeban ek maheene tak practice kii thi
 On this, Salman Khan asked which step was that for which he had to practice for 1 month? Because this step was related to jumping at the knees, Katrina Kaif told Salman not to do this dance step
 maaloom ho ki salmaan khan ke ghutanon main takalif he
 Salman stayed Salman
 deccan chronical kii ek report ke mutabik chalange kiye jane par peeche nahin hatane vaale salmaan khan dance step karne ke liye apni kursi se uth gaye
 Katrina tried to hold his hand and stopped, but Salman released his hand and moved towards the stage
 salmaan jab stage par pahunche to katrina caff ne phir ek baar mike par kaha ki wo is stant ko nahin karen kyonki yah unke ghutanon ke liye thik nahin hai
 But the stubborn Moodjah Salman stunted and started coming back towards his chair

 Salman not only ignored Katrina's talk but also proved how easy that dance step was by showing that dance step in one stroke
 iske alaava jab katrina caff or shilpa shetty dance karne ke liye stage par aae tab bhi salmaan unke saath dance steps match karne ke liye jid par ad gaye
 In a way, Salman's dance is like an insult on Katrina's one month's hard work
 vaise salmaan har baat halke phulke andaaj main karne ke liye mashhoor hai

 The film also gave a new flight to Shahrukh's career
 is film ke bare main baat karte hue salmaan ne pinkavila se kaha tha, 'haa maine baazeegar ko thukraayaa tha
 When abbas-mustan brought me the script, i talked to my father about it

 saal 2003 main ai munnabhai embibies pehle shahrukh ko ofer hui thi lekin unhone apni chot ke chalate is film ko thukraayaa tha
 Shah Rukh also felt that he would not be able to do justice to this film
 reports ye bhi hai ki is film ke liye shahrukh ne hi sanjay kaa naam sujhaayaa tha

 In the ICC World Cup-2019, there will be two such teams, which are still undefeated in this World Cup
 bharat or newjiland ne abhi tak is world cap main jitne bhi match khele hai, sabhi main jeet hasil kii he
 If the rain did not disrupt, then the winning order of any one team is sure to be broken in this match to be held at Trent Bridge ground
 barish kii sambhaavna, pehle 3 match ho chuke hai raddgruuvaar ko achche mausam kii bhavishyavaanee nahin kii gai he or aisi bahut sambhaavna he ki match main barish dakhal de
 The pitch at Trent Bridge is easy, but fast bowlers can be effective if the weather turns
 barish ke kaaran ab tak is world cap main 3 match radd ho chuke hai
 There will be a big challenge for New Zealand, there is a big difference in the win of these two teams
 bhartiya team ne majboot tiimon ko shikast di he, jabaki newjiland kii jeet kamjor tiimon ke khilaaf ai he
 In such a situation, it will be the first major challenge before New Zealand as India
 donon tiimon ne apane-apane match jithenujiland ne teen match khele hai or teenon main jeet hasil kii he
 India has played two matches and won them both
 bharat ne apane pehle match main dakshin africa ko maat di thi or duusare match main gat vijeta australia ko haraaya tha
 India had lost to New Zealand in the practice match, India has faced New Zealand in the practice match and lost there
 abhyaas match main kiwi team ke saamne bharat kii ballebaaji dhah gai thi
 In this match, the Indian team will be careful keeping their defeat in mind
 sheersh kram main dhawan kii kami team ko khalegibharat kaa satark rahanaa jaruri bhi he kyonki is match main uske pramukh ballebaajon main se ek shikhar dhawan nahin honge
 Dhawan is out due to a thumb injury
 yah chot unhen australia ke khilaaf match main lagi thi
 In that match, Dhawan played an excellent innings of 117 runs
 dhawan jaisi form main chal rahe ballebaaj kaa baahar hona bharat ke liye pareshaani he
 Lokesh Rahul against New Zealand in place of Dhawan, with Rohit Sharma as the opening pair can step on the field
 vijah shankar par baari pad sakate hai kartikarahul pichley do maichon main number-4 par khele the
 Now whom does captain Virat Kohli land at number-4, it will be known only on the day of the match
 dhawan ke jane ke baad harfanmaulaa khilaadi vijay shankar or anbhavi dinesh karthik ke rup main kohli ke paas vikalp he
 Shankar was selected by the selectors for the number-4 only, but Karthik's experience may be overshadowed by Shankar
 dhawan ke jane se kohli or rohit par jimmedaari bad gai he
 Chances of change in bowling There is little chance of any change in bowling
 bhubaneshwar kumaar or jasprit bumraah ne nai gend se behtareen shuruyaat di thi or rangati ko roke rakhaa tha
 At the same time, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal had also done away with Australia by winning their responsibility in the middle order
 ab tak kamjor team se hua he newjiland kaa samatogar newjiland kii baat kii jaae to abhi tak jo teen match usne khele hai, ve srilanka, bangladesh or afghanistan kii team se hue hai
 As of India, this is the biggest challenge of the tournament so far
 team ek baar phir ummid karegi ki trent bolt, mat henry, locky ferguson kii genden bhartiya ballebaajon ke wicket jaldi le saken
 New Zealand's main focus will be on sending the pavilions to the top order weakened by Dhawan's departure
 ballebaaji main bhi newjiland ke liye pareshaani kam nahin he
 Ross Taylor is definitely in form and he has world class batsmen in the form of Martin Guptill and captain Kane Williamson, but there is also world class bowling in front which can destroy any batting attack
 timen :newjiland :ken williamson (captain), tom blandal, trent bolt, colin di grandehome, locky ferguson, martin gaptil, tom latham, colin munro, jimi nisham, henry nicols, mishael santner, ish sodhi, tim soudi, ross tailor

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is trying to save his political land in Bihar
 november, 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main puri tarah safaya ho jane ke kaaran ek lambii chuppi ke baad lalu ne 3 june kii police golibari peediton ke samarthan main 3 sitambar ko arriya jile tak, farbis ganj yatra shuru kii
 Four people, including an infant and a pregnant woman, were killed in police firing on a group of Muslims protesting a business establishment in Bhajanpura village
 farbis ganj ke daure ke do din baad lalu mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke grih jile nalanda kaa ek aspataal bhi dekhne gaye, jahaan unhone apane ghaavon kaa ilaaj kara rahi pichhadi jati kii ek mahila kaa haalchaal poocha, jisko gaanv ke kuch dabang logon ne maaraa-peeta tha
 Lalu financed Rs
 1 lakh each to the family of the deceased in Bhajanpura, helping the victims financially

 lamps
 apane svarnim dinon main lalu aam janata ke jaadugar hua karte the, jo unase sidhe jud jate the or jahaan bhi jate, janata ke saath rishta kaayam kar lete the
 Nearly six years after Nitish ousted him from power in November 2005, his arrogance seems to be over and his personality-focused campaigning seems to be over, perhaps because he is now betting on such issues There are those who can wake up the public
 lalu ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki bihar main muddon kii koi kami nahin he
 But the bad news is that Lalu has no credibility, so that he can run a big mass movement
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke samay ve rajya main aam janata se jude muddon ko uthaane main naakaam rahe the, jaise ki rajya kii kharaab aabkaari niti
 Even now it took him three months to reach the victims of Bhajanpura, while Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi had reached his place only on 1 July
 tajjub nahin ki nitish ne lalu ke is prayaas par chutki lete hue kaha, ''lagata he, unki neend kaaphi der se khuli he
 "from their two visits in early September, it seems that they are once again engaged in the exercise of regaining their support base
" vakt ke saath lalu badal gaye hai
 But the problem is that Bihar has also changed

 Rohit Sharma is known for playing good strokes
 unki isi takat kaa phayda tej gendbaaj trent bolt ne uthaaya
 Rohit tampered with the ball going out of the off stump of Bolt and gave his wicket
 rohit ne 27 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 15 ran banaae jisamen unhone ek chaukaa or ek chakka lagaaya
 Kohlistar batsman Virat Kohli, who failed at the homeground, was expected to have a big innings at his home ground
 unhone bhi har kisi ko niraash kiya
 Kohli faced 13 balls and scored just nine runs
 jisamen unhone ek chaukaa lagaaya
 Virat has played eight innings so far, including in Tests and odis at his homeground
 lekin unke naam par sirf ek shatak darj he
 Which he scored against England in 2011 (112 not out)

 bollywood ko li se hatakar filmein dene vaale jane-maane film diarector anuraag kashyap sahitya or cinema par apni baat rakhane ke liye ajtak ke litarechar festival 'sahitya aaj tak' kaa hissaa bane
 Anurag Kashyap gave many interesting ideas related to his experience on cinema and literature in the festival session 'naya Cinema Nai Zuban'
 ham hameshaa bhaand nahin ho sakate, sahitya or cinema vahi jo sone naa dipane filmameking kariyar kii shuruyaat ke dinon ko yaad karte hughanurag kashyapane kaha ki shuruaati daur main film banane ko lekar unamem kaaphi bachapanaa tha
 He said, 'I did not know that Dawood Ibrahim could not say' Dawood Ibrahim 'in the film,' Shiv Sena 'could not be called Shiv Sena
 mujhe to bas itnaa pataa ki jo baat mere jahan he mujhe waisi hi bayaan karnaa he
 Later it was revealed that this is also a fight in cinema
 ' filmon ko lekar anuraag ke alag test ke bare main puche gaye sawaal par vah bole, 'hamaare samaaj main yah dharna dilo dimag main basaa di gai he ki jo cheez aapako vichlit karti he wo galat he
 This is the cry about films
 meraa maananaa he jo aapako sochane par majaboor kare, son naa de vahi sahitya he or vahi cinema he
 We cannot always be a buffoon, just keep doing entertainment all the time
 bachapan main jab jab sawaal poocha to daant diya gaya, isliye ab filmon main sawaal poochta humbachapan se hianuragko likhane kaa shauk rahaa he lekin anuraag ne bataaya ki jab vah likhte hai to aise likhte hai jaise ulti karte he kehane kaa matlab ki jo dimag main aae vah likhte hi chale jate hai
 Anurag said that he was in school when he first wrote poetry and the school refused to print his poem in the magazine
 isaki vajah bataai gai ki unki riting dark he
 After reading this poem, Anurag's family members were called and said that what he writes, he writes very dark
 is tarah bachapan se hi anuraag ko aisi hi chizon or vichaaron ko bayaan karne kaa shauk rahaa jiske upar koi baat nahin karnaa chahta
 Anurag told that we have grown up in such an environment where if any question is asked about sex or religion, then there was scolding that where did you hear and where are you learning all this
 mujhe bhi aisa hi maahaul mila
 But now i question people through my films
 kyonki mere liye wo film nahin jo logon ke jahan main koi sawaal yaa koi soch naa chode
 Cinema has 10% literature, the rest is Mastram, Anurag Kashyap stressed that in the current era, cinema has taken the place of literature, but literature in films is only 10 percent, the rest is Mastram
 anuraag bole, 'aajkal sahitya padhanaa kam ho gaya he
 Visual media is in practice and cinema is replacing literature
 to cinema ko sahitya kii jimmevary leni hogi
 'anurag also said that what is limited is not literature, it cannot be read as literature because what kind of literature should be tied to the scope of words? Anurag said, 'I consider Kashinath a great litterateur and there are very big litterateurs who do not even print
 har insaan kaa khud kii baat ko bayaan karne apana ek tarika hota he ek standap kamedian bhi jo bolta he uskaa bhi ek sahitya he, main use bhi sahityakar maanata hum' Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has said that we want to maintain a cordial relationship with India
 gilaani ne kaha ki ham anya deshon se anurodh karte hai ki ve bharat ko halaat saamaanya karne ke liye kahen
 Gilani said that we do not want our land to be used for any kind of terrorism, it is our responsibility
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main gaiyrsarkari pakshon ko safal nahin hone diya jayega
 Gilani said that the public is under tremendous pressure on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, otherwise good relations would have developed between us

 There are frequent reports of estrangement between Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
 'i dil he mushkil' kii relies ke samay bhi aisi khabar ai thi ki film main aishwarya ke hot seens se abhishek khush nahin hai
 However, these news soon died down
 fasebuk par nahin hai aishwarya, kya abhishek hai isaki vajah?ab 'amar ujaalaa' kii report kii maane to aradhya kii vajah se donon main ek baar phir dooriyaan aa gayi hai
 Actually Abhishek wants Aaradhya to start working as a child artist in Bollywood from now on, so that she starts experiencing acting now
 lekin abhishek ke is faisle se aishwarya khush nahin hai
 She wants to keep her daughter away from the limelight
 isi vajah se donon main tanatani ho gai he
 Abhishek Bachchan misbehaved with Aishwarya Rai on the red carpet, watch the video, although no one has commented on these news yet but it is getting a little hard to believe
 desh main iviem ko lekar kai raajnneetik dalon ne aawaaj uthaai or aarope lagaaya ki iviem se chhedchhad kii ja sakati he, chunaav ayog lagaataar in aaropon ko nakaarta rahaa he
 The Election Commission claims that evms cannot be tampered with
 lekin aarope lagane vaale dalon ne chunaav ayog kii nahin maani
 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi tried to show tampering by bringing a machine like EVM in the assembly
 unka daawa he ki unke paas aise haikar hai jo yah sabit karenge ki iviem ko hack kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir isse manachaahe parinaam hasil kiye ja sakate hai
 At the same time, amid all these allegations, the Election Commission has presented an open challenge to political parties to prove tampering in evms
 chunaav ayog ne saaf kar diya he ki yah chunauti kuch sharton ke saath hai
 Let us see what are these conditions
 
 
 raajnneetik partiyaan haalia vidhansabha chunaav main istemaal kii gai mashiinon kaa istemaal kar sakati hai lekin videshi visheshgyon ke isamen bhaag lene kii pabandi he
 The challenge will be open only to national and state parties who contested elections in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa and Punjab
 unhen iviem kii madraboard badalane or gadabadi ko baad kii taarikh main sabit karne ke liye use ghar le jane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 The commission said that the EVM with the changed chip will not be the EVM of the Election Commission, but will look like that
 pratibhaagiyon (har party se teen sadsy) ko iviem kii padtaal kii ijaajat hogi taaki ve circuit, chip or madraboard kii jaanch kar sake
 Four evms of his choice will be given to him from the assembly seats of five states
 chunauti ke bare main faisla mukhya rup se ayog kii takneekee visheshgy samiti ke sadsy karenge taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki niyamon kaa paalan ho or mashine kshatigrast naa ho
 The challenge will run for about 4-5 days, depending on the number of participants
 iske liye aavedan karne kii aakhri taarikh 26 may he
 Each participant group will be given four hours to hack the machine
 varsh 2009 kii chunauti kaa aayojan vigyaan bhawan main hua tha lekin is baar iskaa aayojan sthal nirvachan sadan hoga jo ayog kaa mukhyalay he
 Zaidi said that it would be in two parts
 pehle bhaag ke tahat partiyon ko yah sabit karnaa hoga ki kisi khaas ummidavaar yaa party ke paksh main paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav main istemaal kii gai iviem se chhedchhad hui thi or mashin main darj nateezon main badlaav kar aisa kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, under the second part of the challenge, the participants will have to prove that there was a mess in these evms on or before the day of polling
 vahiin, in sab aaropon ke bich chunaav ayog ne iviem main chhedchhad sabit karne ke liye raajnneetik dalon ko khuli chunauti pesh kii he
 The Election Commission has made it clear that these challenges are subject to certain conditions
 aaie dekhen kya hai ye sharten
 
 
 Political parties may use the machines used in the recent assembly elections but foreign experts are prohibited from participating in it
 yah chunauti sirf rashtriya or rajya partiyon ke liye khuli hogi jinhone paanch rajyon - uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, manipur, goa or punjab main hua chunaav ladaa tha
 They will not be allowed to change evm's motherboard and take it home to prove the disturbance at a later date
 ayog ne kaha ki badali hui chip ke saath iviem chunaav ayog kii iviem nahin hogi, balki us jaisi dikhegi
 Participants (three members from each party) will be allowed to investigate the evms so that they can check the circuit, chip and motherboard
 paanch rajyon kii vidhansabha siton se unki pansad kii chaar iviem unhen di jaaengi
 The challenge will be decided mainly by the members of the Commission's Technical Expert Committee to ensure that the rules are followed and that the machines are not damaged
 chunauti kareeb 4-5din chalegi, jo pratibhaagiyon kii sankhya par nirbhar he
 The last date to apply for this is 26 May
 har pratibhaagi samooh ko mashin hack karne ke liye chaar ghante kaa vakt diya jayega
 The challenge of the year 2009 was organized in Vigyan Bhawan but this time its venue will be Election House which is the headquarters of the Commission
 jaidi ne kaha ki yah do bhaagon main hoga
 Under the first part, the parties have to prove that the evms used in the assembly elections in five states in favor of a particular candidate or party were tampered with and this was done by altering the results recorded in the machine
 vahiin, chunauti ke duusare bhaag ke tahat pratibhaagiyon ko yah sabit karnaa hoga ki in iviem main matdaan ke din yaa us din ke pehle gadabadi kii gai thi
 The Supreme Court on Wednesday confirmed the government policy of foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retailing business (retail) and said that as a policy it has no constitutional or statutory weakness
 nyaayamurti aar
 M
 lodha kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne bahu-brands retail main epadiai ko chunauti dene vaali yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha, 'niti ko prabhavit karne vaale maamle main yah court tab tak hastkshep nahin karti, jab tak niti asanvaidhanik, vaidhanik praavdhaanon ke viruddh, manamaana, betuka yaa shakti kaa durupyog nahin ho
 The court said that the disputed policy of allowing FDI in multi-brand retail does not have anything to do with any out of bounds and the challenge given to it is not justified

 sharma ne niti ko chunauti di thi
 He had stated that the policy was accepted by issuing two press notes and that the relevant provisions and rules regulating FDI in retail were not amended

 Shourie said on the sidelines of a function, "this is a definite thing and at this time Modi is the only contender for the post of Prime Minister in the party
" ’ unhone kaha ki modi ke saath anek party kaaryakartaaon kaa samarthan he
 There is always some movement in the politics of Bihar
 is baar siyaasi halchal jadyu ke bheetar hi he or uske centre main hai ranneetikaar or jadyu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor
 Prashant Kishore has been in the media headlines for some time due to his statements and activities
 prashanth kishor aise-aise bayaan de rahe hai, jo aane vaale chunaavon main jadyu ke liye musiibat sabit ho sakate hai or iskaa siyaasi phayda vipaksh uthaa saktaa he
 From the statement that made the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, to the fact that the JDU is not going with the BJP, like the statement of Prashant Kishore, the JDU seems angry
 sutara aisa bataa rahe hai ki jadyu main prashanth kishor ko lekar kaaphi naaraazgi he or dabi jubaan se ve prashanth kishor ke bayanon se kinaaraa bhi kar rahe hai
 From some statements of Prashant Kishore, it seems that everything is not going well for him and Nitish Kumar
 agar haal hi ke ghatnakramon par najar daalen to aisa lag rahaa he ki jadyu or prashanth kishor donon alag-alag dhara main chal rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore apologized on behalf of the government and the party when there was no tribute from the government and the party to the martyr Pintu Singh of Begusarai
 phir jab vah mujffarpur main yuvaaon ke saath kaarykram main gaye, tab unhone kaha ki unhone desh main pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri banaae hai, ab vah yuvaaon ko bhi saasand, vidhayak banaaenge
 After this, another statement of his is becoming viral in which he is saying that Nitish Kumar should not form an alliance with BJP
 darasal, prashanth kumaar ke ye kuch haalia aise bayaan hai, jisase jadyu kinaaraa kar rahi he
 There is a lot of resentment about Prashant Kishore in JDU because of these statements
 jadyu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor in dinon bihar kii raajnneeti main surkhiyon main hai
 Prashant Kishore is very much impressed with his statement
 beete dinon bihar ke mujffarpur main yuvaaon ke saath ek kaarykram ke dauraan prashanth kishor ne yah bayaan diya ki unhone ab tak piem or siem banane main madad kii he ab ve bihar ke yuvaaon ko saansad-vidhayak, mukhiya or ward banane main madad karenge
 Prashant Kishore's MP-MLA statement has made his party leaders uncomfortable
 jadyu pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha he ki unki party ke role model nitish kumaar hai
 It is in the hands of the public to make someone as MLA-MP as Neeraj Kumar
 unhone kaha he ki unki party is bayaan se ittefaq nahin rakhti he
 Neeraj Kumar said that the party only creates atmosphere, making the leader is in the hands of the public
 unhone kaha ki ve nitish kumaar ke netritv main kaam karke acha mahus karte hai
 In an interview, Prashant Kumar said that after Nitish Kumar broke ties with the Grand Alliance, he should not go with the BJP and go to the re-election for a fresh mandate
 prashanth kishor kaa yah bayaan isliye kaaphi ahm ho jaataa he kyonki prashanth kishor na sirf jadyu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh hai balki vah nitish kumaar ke bhi kaaphi kareebi maane jate hai
 It is expected that the opposition may try to capitalize on this statement of Prashant Kishore and its mileage in the elections
 3 march ko patna main hue endie kii raily main bhi prashanth kishor nadaarad dikhe
 Prashant Kishore had no role in the NDA rally and was not even present in Patna that day
 sutron kii maane to jadyu kii taraf se unhen raily ke liye koi jimmedaari nahin di gai thi
 However, the next day came to the party meeting
 bijepi se unki duuri kii vajah unke us bayaan se bhi saaf jhalki ki unhone party kii baithak main safai di ki ve shivasena se lekar jis party se bhi baatcheet kar rahe hai, vah sirf nitish kumaar ke liye hi kar rahe hai
 On 3 March, no leader from the JDU or the government went to pay tribute to Shaheed Pintu Singh from Begusarai in Patna
 ise lekar sarkaar or party ko aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Prashant Kishore himself apologized for the criticism
 unhone apane twitor acount se maafee maangi thi ki unase galati hui
 
 
 
 and the follow-up pic
 twitter
 com / copdgebsv3haalanki, baad main khud siem nitish kumaar shahid pintu singh ko shradhanjali dene gaye
 In Dhyanchakki village of Begusarai, he went to pay homage to the martyr Pintu Singh
 ise prashanth kishor ne apane twitor acount par share kiya or likhaa- and da folsop
 That is, it is clear from Prashant Kumar's tweet that he is trying to tell that only after his tweet, Nitish Kumar went to his house to pay tribute to martyr Pintu Singh
 prashanth kishor ke is twit ke baad se jadyu ke kai netaa unase naaraaz hai
 If sources are to be believed, dissatisfaction against Prashant Kishor is increasing among JDU leaders
 kai jadyu netaa yah maan rahe hai ki prashanth kishor khud ko party se bada maanane lage hai
 He also wants to make himself bigger than the party
 jadyu ke kuch netaa yah maanane lage hai ki prashanth kishor party kaa kaam na karke apni branding kar rahe hai
 There is also resentment in the party over the fact that he considers himself number two in JDU
 khwaabon ko puraa karne ke liye bahut jaruri he ki koshish main koi kami naa ho
 Every effort you make will take you one step closer to your dream
