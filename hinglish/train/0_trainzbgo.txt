 aam aadmi party kii punjab ikai main khuli baghawat ke baad ab party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal khud kaman sanbhaalane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 According to the sources, Kejriwal will visit Punjab in September in view of the recent developments in the Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party and thereafter he will visit Punjab continuously from October
 kejariwal is dauraan 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja bhi lenge
 The AAP leader and former Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, Sukhpal Khaira, was removed from the post by angry central leadership due to his objectionable statements
 pad se hataae jane ke baad khera ne party vidhayakon ke saath khuli baghawat kar di
 Recently, Khaira rallied in Bathinda to show strength with rebel leaders
 sutron ke mutabik party baagi netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The party's focus will remain on these states, aap's entire focus will be on Delhi, Punjab and Haryana for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 oktober se kejariwal punjab or haryana kaa daura karenge or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon par khud najar rakhenge
 It is only during this visit of Kejriwal that a reshuffle in the party's organization can be seen in Punjab
 sutron ke mutabik aam aadmi party ke punjab prabharee or dilli main upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya jald hi punjab kaa daura karenge or netaaon, kaaryakartaaon ke saath milakar party ke sanghathan par charchaa karenge
 Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party has rejected the resignations of Bhagwant Mann and Aman Arora and issued instructions to them to continue in their posts
 aise main bhagwant maan punjab main aam aadmi party ke pradesh adhyaksh bane rahenge
 But in the meantime, the rebellion of the 6 mlas from the party may harm the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab somewhere
 khera kii meeting main pahunche the 6 mlavixanasaba main netaa vipaksh ke pad se hataae jane ke baad sukhpal khera ne guuruuvaar ko party netaaon kii ek baithak bulaai thi
 In which 6 Aam Aadmi Party mlas took part
 chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki party netritv kii taraf se sabhi ko chetavanee di gai thi ki koi bhi is baithak main shaamil naa ho
 Ahead of the rebels' show of power in Punjab, on Wednesday, the Aam Aadmi Party indicated to the Punjabi unit that in such a situation it would take stern action against the rebels

 us sarkaar main shaamil hone kii kya tuk he jo ant kii ore bad rahi he?'' uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne india today se muskaraate hue kuch aisa kaha
 This answer was on our question in which we asked him whether the Samajwadi Party would join the Congress-led government at the Center
 yah 18 july kii shaam kii baat he jiske kuch hi ghanton pehle unke pita mulaayam singh yadav raashtrapati chunaav ke pehle upie dwaara yojit shandaar lunch main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath teble par baithe hue the
 For those who thought that this lunch was a stake role in the government, this statement was disappointing
 isse is baat kaa bhi sanket mila ki rajnatik jamaat ko pataa haih mulaayam ke paas turup ke ikke hai or ve ain maukey par unhen chalenge
 Akhilesh's comment is part of the hallmark that has been seen since March this year
 paanch saal baad uttar pradesh main sapa ke satta main aane ke kuch samay baad hi 18 march ko party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue mulaayam singh yadav ne apana akalan pesh kiyah ''kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa ki aam chunaav (jo 2014 main hona he) kab ho jaaen
 It can happen any day now
 '' isi vichaar ko unhone paanch din ke baad lakhanu main ek samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue doharaaya
 After this, on June 11, while addressing his party's Central Parliamentary Board in the capital, he asked the mps to work hard and be ready for the early elections
 iske ek maheene baad 10 july ko mulaayam singh ne ek baar phir chunaavon kii sambhaavna jataakar rajnatik tabake main halchal machaa di
 Addressing SP workers at the party office at 19, Vikramaditya Marg, Lucknow, he said, "we should be ready for elections
" yah samay se pehle ho sakate hai or sambhawatah agle saal hi
 It is therefore important that party leaders work seriously and visit their respective regions
 '' iske kuch minute baad hi isi manch par unke chachere bhai ramgopal yadav ne us samay maahaul or garma diya jab unhone un sabhi 58 loksabhaa kshetron ke liye paryvekshakon ke naamon kii ghoshnaa kar di jahaan 2009 ke chunaav main sapa ummidavaar haar gaye the
 Akhilesh clarified on this, "lok Sabha elections are to be held in early 2014 by any means
 isliye agar ham apane logon se 2013 tak taiyaar rahane ko kah rahe hai to isamen chetavanee vaali koi baat nahin he
 After all, i too started my rath yatra seven months before the elections in Uttar Pradesh
 ''mulaayam lagaataar aise khel khilne yaa tevar dikhaakar upie ko post karne ke abhyast ho chuke hai
 His approximate mathematics is based on rigorous analysis of ground reality
 ve samajhate hai ki march main vidhansabha chunaav main mili jeet kii oonchai se or upar janaa shaayad hi sambhav hoga or agar unhen agle loksabhaa chunaav main zyada se zyada siten jeetni hai to lambey samay tak intjaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He can get maximum seats from the election in March 2013, while he will hardly get his performance so well after the election in 2014
 lekin mulaayam yadi sarkaar ko giraakar chunaav ke liye majaboor karnaa chaahate hai to unhen jald kuch karnaa hoga
 Something like this can happen during the monsoon season which starts on 8 August
 rasookh ke badhate sankat se lekar sahyogi dalon kii mahatvakankshaon tak kai vajahon se agast kaa maheenaa congress ke liye asaadhaaran rup se ashaant rahane vaala he
 Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee also has the same thinking as Mulayam Singh
 ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ne bhi upie mantrimandal main pradhanmantri ke baad number-2 haisiyat na milane par istife kii dhamkee de daali he
 The search for the right electoral story will be the direction of this storm, where Mulayam will take it
 unke paas loksabhaa kaa santulan he, na sirf sankhya par balki uske dolane kii gati par bhi
 Mulayam has expressed his wish, but he has not made it clear what his plan is to achieve this objective
 yah khel bhi jokhim bharaa he
 When you force an early election, you should have a story for it to satisfy the public
 sarkaar is tathy se kuch raahat mahasoos kar rahi he ki sarkaar ko asthir karne kii raah dhundhlee he or isse aasaani se nipta ja saktaa he
 The Congress' past record of destabilizing governments is a lesson that leaders do not want to forget
 congress ne centre main chaar sarkarein giraayi hai, lekin aisi sirf ek kavayad se use phayda hua he
 Indira Gandhi played the game of toppling Charan Singh's government in 1979, Rajiv Gandhi uprooted the Chandrasekhar government in 1991, Sitaram Kesari in 1997
 di
 Deve Gowda and in 1998 Indra Kumar Gujral sank the government
 lekin sirf indira gandhi hi is khel kaa phayda uthaa pain kyonki unhone bahut soch-samaj kar yojana banaai thi ki aage unhen kya karnaa he
 Mulayam knows that he cannot create an atmosphere for early elections on the strength of only 21 mps in the Lok Sabha
 iske liye unhen upie ke bheetar hi congress virdohi gathbandhan bananaa hoga
 Will they get the support of allies or one of their groups for this? The UPA has the support of 272 mps in the Lok Sabha, barely half of the 543-member Lok Sabha
 inamen tiemasi ke 19 sadsy shaamil hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party (20 mps) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (4 mps) are supporting from outside
 sarkaar ko giraane kii kahani sirf party ke liye phydemand vajahon ke aadhaar par nahin rachi ja sakati
 The public must understand that the government has lost its concern
 mulaayam singh sabase badhiya tark yah de sakate hai ki kisaan aarthik rup se badahaal hote ja rahe hai
 In a large part of the country, the politics of dissatisfaction has gained an edge due to the possibility of drought
 aarthik susti or lagaataar badhati mahangaai kii niraashajanak kahani sabko pataa he
 a weak monsoon is going to hit Mulayam's mainstay supporting farmers
 sarkaar dwaara sanchalit bhartiya mausam vigyaan vibhaag (iemdi) ke anusaar, june ke pehle teen hafton main desh bhar main barish lambey samay ke ausat kaa 76 fisadi hi rahi
 Below 94 percent of the average rainfall is considered deficient
 iemdi ke anusaar agast maah main saamaanya se kam 42 fisadi barish hone kii sambhaavna he or saamaanya barish hone kii sambhaavna 36 fisadi
 According to IMD, the situation will only get worse, not better
 arthshaastri or purv kendriya mantri yogendra ke
 Alagh believes that the kharif crop has been damaged
 unhone kaha, ''puure june or july ke pehle hafte main barish na hone se buaai bahut kam ho pai he
 The yields are also reduced as the initial rainfall decreases
 ''is prakaar kamjor monsoon krishi paidaavaar par gambhir asar daal saktaa he
 However, this will have little impact on GDP as agriculture sector contributes only 14 per cent of GDP
 lekin logon par iskaa asar bahut zyada hoga kyonki desh kii kul shramashakti kaa 52 fisadi hissaa krishi kshetra main laga he
 Says Alagh, "there will be a decrease in employment, serious drinking water problem and people will become more dependent on MNREGA
 '' pramukh krishi jinson ke daam bhi bad jaaenge jiskaa asar samoochee aabaadi par hoga
 Inflation based on wholesale price index in June 55 fisadi se girakar 7
 Food inflation rose to 25 percent during this period, rising to 10 percent
 81 fisadi par pahunch gai jo june, 2011 (saamaanya monsoon) ke 7
 Is much higher than 6 per cent
 yadi khaadya vastuon kii keemten badhati raheen to diwaali tak mahangaai kii dar phir se do ankon main pahunchane kii ashanka he
 Low rainfall will create an inevitable situation in which every state will demand additional packages
 karnataka ke nae mukhyamantri jagadish shettar ne 18 july ko centre sarkaar se 2,000 karod ru
 The package is demanded
 mulaayam ne centre sarkaar ko un project ke liye 45,000 karod ru
 Has refused to give a grant of which could not yet be got due to the inaction of the state government, but if there is a drought, he will ask for more money
 agar duusare rajyon ko madad mili to mamata banerjee bhi chup nahin baithengi, jinaki bengal ke liye 22,000 karod ru
 Demand for package of US was turned down, demand for drought related help would put tremendous pressure on the central government which is already grappling with uncontrollable financial deficit
 sookhaa raahat package main yadi 50,000 karod ru
 If incurred, it incurs a financial loss of 0
 5 fisadi kii badhat ho jaaegi
 Again the pressure will be bad in the monsoon session, however the strong monsoon alone is not going to increase the headache of the UPA government
 manmohan singh sarkaar bhrashtachar ke kai aaropon se jujh rahi he jisase congress pehle se hi buree tarah post he
 Dissatisfaction against this has made it headstrong in the Uttar Pradesh civic elections, the results of which were announced on 7 July
 meyar kii 14 siton main se 12 siten bijepi ke khate main gayi, jabaki do anya siton par sapa or basapa samarthit nirdaleey pratyaashee kabiz hue
 The monsoon session of Parliament, starting on August 8, will see further pressure on the government
 ek ore sarkaar nitigat pakshaaghaat ke liye bhartiya udyog jagat or videshi netaaon kii baari aalochana jhel rahi he-america raashtrapati baraak obama or singapore ke pradhanmantri lee siin liung haal ke hafton main is maamle main mukhar rahe hai
 Will have to answer this
 isliye epadi ko lekar nae sire se sakriyata dikh rahi he
 The last time the government tried to open FDI in retail was in November 2011, it faced rebellion in the UPA
 congress ko lagata he ki ab sthiti duusari he
 But she may be wrong
 18 july ko kendriya vaanijya mantri anand sharma ne ek bijness akhbaar se kaha ki pashchim bengal ke alaava anya rajyon kii ore se retail kaarobaar main epadi ke virodh kii sambhaavna bahut kam he
 On the same day, Akhilesh told a newspaper that FDI in retail business is against the common man
 sarkaar yadi epadi ke agenda par aage badhati he to mulaayam or mamata se takaraav aprihaary he
 Even in the case of deregulation of the price of diesel, the government may have to face the wrath of allies in Parliament, due to which the price of diesel in one stroke is Rs
 13
 prati litre bad jaaegi
 Mulayam can stand with Mamata if the Congress raises major issues of economic mismanagement
 congress ke saamne ab sadan main floor management kii chunautiyaan bad gai hai kyonki ab pranab mukherjee raashtrapati bhawan kii ore agrasar hai
 Perhaps the most difficult immediate decision for the Congress will be to decide the name of the leader of the Lok Sabha
 keval mukherjee ke paas hi vah kad or prabhaav tha ki ve bijepi ke chaar varisht netaaon-murali manohar joshi, rajnath singh, yashavanth sinha or jaswant singh ko 15 march ko loksabhaa main unhen ''chidchide bacchon jaise vyavhaar par'' dapat lagaate hue baitha paae
 And nobody has the stature that can reprimand someone in this way
 isliye achraj kii baat nahin he ki is daant-fatkaar ke baad sonia ne mukherjee ke kaan main kaha tha, ''isliye to hamen aapaki jarurat he
 "zero party of the summit, if Yuvraj Nadradamulayam Singh, Mamta Banerjee and other allies of the coalition are now in a strong position to tighten the UPA government, it is only because the Congress leadership is weak
" paanch saal pehle raashtrapati chunaav ke vakt kisi ne chuun tak nahin kii thi
 This time there was a ruckus
 congress main halaat aise ban gaye hai ki saamaanya ghatana bhi sankat kii shakl le rahi he
 In such a situation, the strategy of the Congress is to propagate that another crisis has been averted and now everything is fine
 raashtrapati chunaav ke liye matdaan se thik ek din pehle 18 july ko sonia ne dilli ke ashok hotel main upie or uske sahyogiyon ko daavat di
 There were Indian and Chinese dishes on the table and the agenda of the feast was to thank the allies for their help in the presidential and vice-presidential elections
 chunki janata dal (united) or shivasena upie gathbandhan main nahin hai isliye inhen nyotaa nahin bheja gaya tha, haalanki donon hi partiyon ne mukherjee kaa hi samarthan kiya tha
 Rahul Gandhi, Mulayam, Farooq Abdullah and Prafull Patel were sitting with the Prime Minister while Sharad Pawar, Lalu Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan and TR Baalu were sitting with Sonia
 mayawati is bhoj main nahin ai thim
 They had sent mps
 us bhoj kaa khaanaa pachaa bhi nahin tha ki akhilesh kii tippanee ne siyaasi halake kaa jaayaka bigaad diya
 The flat ground of leadership at the top of the Congress is lying vacant, not only by the opposition but also by the allies
 agle aam chunaav main manmohan singh party kaa netritv nahin karne ja rahe
 Sonia Gandhi is already out of the race due to her health
 mukherjee bhi nahin honge
 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi has not even entered the court
 jab sannata hota he, to congress kahe-sune par siddhant garh leti he
 For example, a cabinet minister said, "according to what i have heard, Rahul has told his mother that he will become the Prime Minister only when the Congress comes to absolute majority
 aisa to khayr kaaphi lambey samay tak nahin hone vaala
 "due to lack of options, the Congressmen are now pressurizing Rahul to come out of his comfort and to take over the responsibility on his shoulders and end his guest role
" congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne media se kaha he ki sitambar tak party sanghathan ke bheetar rahul kuch badi jimmedaariyaan nibhaane lag jaaenge
 After this statement, the Congress began to speculate that Rahul would be made either the Vice President or the Executive Chairman of the party, to which Digvijay told India Today that he did not know anything about his leader's plans, They were just voicing their expectations of the party
 digvijay bole, ''log darasal yahi apeksha kar rahe hai
 September i said because by then the President and Vice President elections would have been over
 vah sahi vakt hoga
 "however, on July 18, when Sonia Gandhi was taking Vice President Hamid Ansari to the post, she put an end to all speculation outside Parliament by making a single statement," No one can speak on behalf of Rahul
 ''agle hi din sansad main rahul ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki ve party or sarkaar main badi bhoomika nibhaane ko taiyaar hai, unhone yah bhi kaha ki unki bhoomika par aakhri faisla congress adhyaksh ko hi lenaa he
 Sonia has been trying for a long time to take command of Rahul's leadership
 pichley agast main unhone is baat ke saaf sanket die the jab ve surgery ke liye videsh gai thim
 Ahmed Patel, Janardan Dwivedi and A
 ke
 He entrusted the affairs of party affairs to his son, along with Antony's three-member core committee
 yahi vah vakt tha jab anna hajaare ne ramlila maidan main anshan kar ke sansad ko takreeban bandhak bana daalaa tha or sarkaar se janalokapal bill paarit karne kii maang uthaai thi
 This was the right opportunity for Rahul to take command, but he was missing from the scene except for a statement in Parliament, which caused the entire party to step back
 us ghatana ke baad se hi ve rashtriya raajnneeti se dur hai
 "during the presidential election, he could easily take command in his own hands," says a party MP
 pranab mukherjee par daanv sateek he
 "at present, the Congress and the Congress are engaged in manipulating the order of organizational confusion
" sarkaar kaa kaam thap padaa he
 Strengthening Aadhaar Mulayam's MY equation is the target of Mulayam Singh
 ve apane muslim-yadav chunavi sameekaran ko majboot karne nikal chuke hai
 He was trusted by the minorities in the assembly elections

 The Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the Congress leader on the cbi's appeal against the acquittal of Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-sikh riot case

 Apart from the CBI, Jagdish and Nirpreet Kaur, family members of the victims, have also challenged the order of the lower court in the case
 inaki yachika par bhi yahi peeth 27 agast ko sunwaayee karegi
 On May 30, the trial court acquitted Sajjan Kumar in this 29-year-old case, saying that he was entitled to receive the benefit of the doubt, as Chief Witness Jagdish Kaur, in his statement before Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission in 1985, accused the accused His name was not taken as such
 nichali adaalat ne kaha tha, ‘yah vaastaviktaa he ki jab pratyakshdarshi or shikayatakarta jagadish cor ne 1985 main nyaayamurti ranganath mishra ayog ke samaksh apana halafanama pesh kiya tha tab unhone sajjan kumaar ke naam kaa ullekh nahin kiya tha haalanki anya aropiyon ke naam liye gaye the
 The lower court, however, convicted five others in the case and sentenced them to imprisonment for being part of a mob that killed Sikhs

 The BJP challenged this when JMM mps voted in favor of the government on the issue of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail business five days ago

 Harendra Pratap, in-charge of the party's Jharkhand unit, questioned, "JMM should go to Raj Bhavan
 ham apni sarkaar ko kyon girane den?" unhone kaha ki bhaajapa nahin chaahati ki rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho

 " It is noteworthy that BJP came to power in Jharkhand in September 2010 with the support of JMM
 bhaajapa ne yah chunauti tab di, jab paanch din purv khudara kaarobaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) ke mudde par jhamumo ke saansadon ne sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan kiya

 jawaab main, jhamumo vidhayak lobin hembram ne kaha, "bhaajapa satta kii bhukhi he
 We challenge the BJP to take the same stand as it did in April 2010
 " Significantly, JMM MP Kameshwar Baitha had voted in favor of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the Lok Sabha on FDI, while MP Shibu Soren of the same party abstained from voting

 Modi's tsunami in Uttar Pradesh completely destroyed the caste equation of the nephew duo
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko kul 303 siten milin
 Out of these, Uttar Pradesh got the maximum 62 seats
 jab buaa yani basapa supremeo mayawati or bhattije yani samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne haath milaayaa tha to aisi sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi ki bhaajapa ko baari nuksaan ho saktaa he
 But the modi-shah duo did such a move that the two got upset
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan kaha ja rahaa tha ki deshbhar main modi kii lahar he
 But when the results came, it was found that the wave was not a tsunami
 isi tsunami main buaa-bhattije kaa jaateey sameekaran bah gaya
 Not only this, Priyanka was fielded to overcome the sinking Naiya of the country's oldest party Congress
 priyanka gandhi ne uttar pradesh main kaaphi jor lagaaya lekin nateeja dhak ke teen paat
 Analysts were telling Priyanka a trump card, which proved to be a failure
 upi kii loksabhaa kii 80 siton main se bhaajapa or apana dal ke gathbandhan ko 64 siten milin, jabaki basapa-sapa ke gathbandhan ko 15 siten milin
 The Congress won only one seat, Rae Bareli, from where Sonia Gandhi won
 sabase hot amethi seat par smriti irani ne rahul gandhi ko karaari shikast di
 Why did the BJP win - Akhilesh aligned with the caste equation
 iske jawaab main modi-shah kii jodi ne sabhi jatiyon ko saadhaa
 For this, BJP distributed electricity and gas connections in rural areas along with Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, construction of toilets in villages i
e
 ODF scheme
 saath hi modi sarkaar ne jandhan, kisaan pension skim or mudra jaisi yojanaon kaa laabh bhi sabhi virgon ko diya
 At the same time, during the election campaign, the BJP also succeeded in bringing it to the people
 yahi bhaajapa ke liye game changer sabit hua
 Jat voters changed: In Uttar Pradesh, the Jat vote was traditionally in favor of the RLD
 lekin 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa ne isamen send maar diya
 This time BJP got 57 percent Jat vote
 35 fisadi vot gathbandhan ko mili jabaki 8 fisadi vot congress or baaki kshetriy partiyon ko mili
 Jat voters moved to BJP
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki areldi sapa or basapa kaa saath milane ke baavjood khaataa bhi nahin khol paaya
 Barring Jatav with Jatav maya-akhilesh, 60 per cent of the Dalit votes went in favor of BJP
 30 fisadi vot mahagathbandhan ko mila, jabaki congress or anya kshetriy dalon ko maatr 10 pratishat vot mili
 Whereas the Jatav vote got the SP-BSP-RLD alliance across the state
 gathbandhan ko kul 74 fisadi jatav vot mili
 The NDA got 21 percent of the vote and the UPA got 3 percent and the rest got 2 percent
 general category or anya jatiyo kaa vongadi jatiyon ne ek baar phir bhaajapa par apana bharosa jataayaa
 His 77 percent vote went in favor of BJP
 gathbandhan ko 12 fisadi vot mili jabaki 11 fisadi vot upie or abiy partiyon ko mili
 The Yadavas once again supported Akhilesh and the SP-BSP alliance got 72 percent of the vote
 endie ko 20 pratishat yadavon kaa vot mila jabaki 8 fisadi vot upie or anya partiyon ko mili, jabaki yadavon ke alaava baaki obisi kaa 76 fisadi vot endie ko mili jabaki mahagathbandhan ko 14 pratishat mili or upie ko sirf 4 pratishat vot mili
 Priyanka trump card fell: Priyanka Gandhi campaigned vigorously in Uttar Pradesh
 unki reliyon main bheed to juty lekin ye vot main parivartit nahin ho saki
 The Congress party got only 6 percent of the total vote

 Her husband Amarchand, arrested on charges of involvement in the conspiracy to kidnap Rajasthan nurse Bhanwari Devi, overturned her statement to a magistrate on Tuesday

 sibiai kaa kahana he ki baad main bhavari kii hatya kar di gai
 Amarchand has filed a petition in the court of an additional judicial magistrate alleging that the CBI had intimidated and recorded the statement under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, so that his statement could be presented as evidence
 is maamle main giraftaar anya chaar aaropee ek dandadhikari ke samaksh bayaan darj karaane ke baad pehle hi apane bayaan se palat chuke hai
 Sources said that on Tuesday, Amarchand filed a petition and requested the court not to read his statement during the hearing

 Making fun of Deepika Padukone's outfit, some people wrote on Twitter that this outfit is influenced by Ranveer Singh
 aisa isliye, kyonki ranvir singh (ranveer Singh) apane manamoji andaaj ke liye jane jate hai
 Apart from this, a Twitter user also described Deepika Padukone's lime green dress as gourd pudding
 vahiin, unki photose par kuch logon ne coment kiya 'baba kaa asar he'
 One person commented on her dress, wrote that 'what Deepika Padukone wore at the Cannes Film Festival 2019 will make the clothes of 10 Indian families in the coming winter
 'there is a lot of drama in Deepika's choice of outfit as well colors in Cannes this year
 
 some credit should definitely go to Mr
 Singh Padukone xxrep 4 ? What Deepika wore at Cannes could have clothed 10 Indian families in the coming winter
 :-)deepika's current lauki ka halwa dress and last year's bougainvillea dress were much better suited for this year's met gala than that pink sea princess dress lolapako bataa den ki sabase pehle deepika padukon (deepika Padukone) blue white color ke outfit main najar ain
 In the next look, she wore a neon green color gown
 apane tisare shandaar luk main unhone white west length pant or white sheer top pahana
 In the fourth look, Deepika Padukone appeared in a floral dress
 yah hai anuraag thakur, jinke bare main sabhi jaanate hai ki ve himachal pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal ke suputr hai or netagiri unhen viraasat main mili he
 Due to his father's influence, he has been in control of the Himachal Cricket Control Association (HPCA) since the age of 25, has been a three-time MP, has been with the BCCI most of the time, and the hpca's influential President, who built an international stadium of cricket in a small hill town like Dharamshala
 unke bare main jo baat zyaadaatar log nahin jaanate hai, vah he unke sivi par laga ek baari dhabba
 In 2000, when he became the President of HPCA, he reached Jammu early in the morning without telling anyone to take part in a Ranji Trophy match
 vahaan pahunchakar unhone team ko bataaya ki ve bhi 11 khilaadiyon main shaamil hokar match khelenge, haalanki team main unka chunaav nahin hua tha
 When the team's captain Rajiv Nayyar protested on this matter, he brushed aside his talk
 pratham shrenee kii apni ekmaatr pari main ve shunya par out ho gaye, par unka makasad puraa ho chukaa tha
 There was only one reason for his playing and that was that he wanted to be the team's selector in the future — for which playing a match in Ranji was mandatory
 is tarah ek prashaasak ke taur par thakur kaa kariyar apyash ke saath shuru hua
 In a way, he introduced the same sense of arrogance that has been the hallmark of BCCI for decades, which created a crisis for him after the Lodha Committee report
 is report ke anusaar, bisisiai main amul-chul badlaav (chayan prakriya main badlaav, padaadhikariyon kii yogyata, or bharat main cricket ke sanchaalan ko peshewar bananaa) kii jarurat he
 Given how far Thakur has come in the last 16 years, his appointment as the second-youngest president of the BCCI on 22 May (earlier in 1963, Maharaja Fatehsinhav Gaekwad of Vadodara became the BCCI president at an early age) It also shows how much they have changed so far

 Srinivasan and the case of spot-fixing in 2013, the death of Jagmohan Dalmiya as chairman in 2015, the resignation of Shashank Manohar from his post to become the ICC President - 41-year-old Anurag Thakur came after most of the former BCCI presidents Are different

 Apart from this, Thakur is handling the board at a time when he is going through the most difficult phase in his 87-year history
 lekin zyaadaatar duusare adhyakshon ke vipareet (or himachal kii team main jabaran pravesh ke baavjood) thakur apane skool or college ke dinon main cricket ke achche khilaadi maane jate the
 Those who played with him in the early 1990s called him a fine batsman who had played well for Punjab in various competitions, and came to India in 1993 against the junior teams of England and Australia

 It was Pandove who proposed his name as BCCI chief at a special meeting of general members in Mumbai last week
 thakur ne india today ko bataaya, ''main cricket khilaadi se prashaasak bana hum
 When i was younger i used to dream of playing cricket for India, but i no longer think about what happened in the past
 ab bisisiai ke adhyaksh ke taur par mere upar kahin badi jimmedaariyaan hai
 "his fortunes in the corridors of power in the BCCI began to shine when Narendra Modi's government was formed at the Center in May 2014
 apni kismat kaa sahaara lete hue unhone 2015 main board ke sachiv pad ke liye chunaav ladane kaa daanv khelaa
 After being harassed and then called upon by Srinivasan, Thakur decided to move to the anti-srinivasan camp and won by a vote against the then secretary Sanjay Patel
 board main duusare sabase mahatvapurn pad par pahunchane ke baad thakur ne daalamia ke kharaab swasthya kii vajah se apana prabhaav dikhaanaa shuru kiya
 He soon learned how to manage in times of crisis and how to manage a rich and complex organization like BCCI
 unhone shuru main hi ek cricket salaahkaar samiti kaa gathan kar diya tha, jisamen junior team ke puraane saathi saurav ganguli, sachin tendulkar or ve
 V
 es lakshmana ne shaamil hokar tab unhen sammaan dilaayaa jab mudgal panel kii report ai thi or bhartiya cricket peedigat badlaav se guzar rahaa tha
 When Dalmiya died of a heart attack, the board took over Manohar, as Thakur was not considered sufficiently mature for the job
 lekin manohar ne jab apana pad chhodane kaa faisla kiya to board ne badi hui javabdehi ke daur main unki jagah kisi anya kaa chunaav karne ke bajaae thakur par daanv lagane kaa faisla kiya
 The next day, happiness was being celebrated at his residence at Janpath in Delhi, but Thakur is well aware that heavy responsibility has come on him
 bisisiai ne lodha samiti kii kai siforeeshon ko court main chunauti de rakhi he, lekin supreme court kaa faisla july main aane kii ummid ke kaaran maujuuda samay pareshaani kaa sabab bana hua he
 In fact, this uncertainty was the main reason why Pawar and Srinivasan, former presidents of the board, did not submit their claim after Manohar's exit
 bisisiai ko bachaane kaa daayitv ab unke kandhon par he
 "I see my role for the post of BCCI president in the same way i saw my role at the time of batting," he says
 main hameshaa jeetne ke liye kheltaa tha, ladaai se bhaagane ke liye nahin
 "but when he was asked about the challenges ahead, Thakur thought it appropriate to leave the crease instead of giving a direct answer
 unhone kaha, ''ham lodha samiti kii siforeeshon se bilkul nahin darate hai
 i do not take it as a challenge
 main ek ashaavadi insaan hum
 Most of the recommendations of the Lodha Committee are not implementable, so why worry about them
 mujhe yakeen he ki supreme court bharat main khel ko bachaana chahega, or bisisiai main hamane khud hi system ko saaf karne kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 i agree that we made mistakes in 2013, but isolated incidents cannot spoil the good work of the BCCI years
 ''bisisiai ke puraane log, jinamein se kuch log dashakon tak rajya str par padon par rahe hai (lodha samiti kii siforishein agar maani gayi to yah ab khatm ho jayega) ummid karte hai ki thakur kaa bijepi se judaa hona board ke liye vardaan sabit ho saktaa he
 However, Thakur, one of the few young faces of the BJP, is close to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is known for spewing fire against the nehru-gandhi family
 bisisiai main rajeev shukla or jyotiraditya sindhiya jaise congress ke netaa bhi unka saath dete hue dikh rahe hai—kam se kam philhal ke liye
 "no one had imagined that he would become chairman of the board so soon and at such a young age," says a vice chairman of the board
 lodha samiti kii siforeeshon ke kaaran is samay har koi sangathit dikhaai de rahaa he lekin agle chah maheene main unki or nae sachiv ajay shirake donon kii asli pariksha hogi
 "there are some people who have high expectations from Thakur
 bharat ke purv khilaadi nikhil chopra, jo thakur ke saath junior cricket khel chuke hai, maanate hai ki ve gharelu or antarrashtriya cricket ke bich kii khai ko bhar sakate hai
 He says, "he was a very good player at the junior level and he knows the difference between the different levels of the game very well
 ve haashie par khadey khiladinnon kii jaruraton or maangon ko samaj sakate hai
 "former India captain and Bengal Cricket Association chief Sourav Ganguly believes that Anurag Thakur is the best option under the current circumstances
 ve kehete hai, ''kya unhone sahi iraadaa nahin dikhaa diya he? main unke saath kai baithkon main shaamil rahaa hum
 They are very serious about the game
 mere liye yah baat bahut myne rakhti he
 Although the glamor and politics of cricket brings a life of pleasure to the politicians, Thakur is known to travel 10 hours from Delhi's Himachal Bhavan by bus to his constituency Hamirpur
 board ke pramukh ke rup main unka kaarykaal bhartiya cricket ke liye puri tarah safal ho saktaa he to puri tarah asafal bhi—thik vaise hi jaise ranjai ke pehle match main unhen apyash mila tha yaa khel main unke gauravshaalee utthan kii tarah, jisamen kabhi ve apni pahchaan banane main asafal rahe the

 This time, in the name of Rahul and Sonia, there is a strong voice in the Congress party
 jahaan aksar congress ke digvijay singh or kamalnath sareekhe netaa sidhe sidhe rahul gandhi ko party kaa adhyaksh banaae jane kii purajor sifarish karte najar aate hai vahiin ek dhada aisa bhi he jo rahul se khaas khush nahin dikhataa
 Congress leaders are unhappy with why Rahul is missing at this critical time
 aise samay main jab janaadhar badhaane or logon main khoyaa vishwaas paane ke liye sonia gandhi lagaataar daure kar rahi hai lekin rahul nadaarad hai
 The land bill was called Rahul Gandhi's baby
 aise main jab land bill par tamaam andolan or sansad main is par bahes charchaaen huin to rahul gandhi us samay bhi maujuud nahin the
 He has been completely missing from the political scenario for a month and a half
 aise main party ke purv saansad or shila dikshit ke bete sandip dikshit ne kaha ki abhi kii paristhitiyon main sonia gandhi ko adhyaksh bane rahane kii jarurat he
 He argued behind this that if the Congress Party is going through a period of time, it should be fine if only the greatest general is to lead it
 sandip ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi sakasham netaa hai, lekin jab kabhi mujhe chunanaa hoga, tab sonia ji hamaari best general rahengi
 'here, let me tell you that Sandeep, who has been a two-time MP, has also once said that 97 to 99 percent of Congress considers Sonia Gandhi as their leader and there is no opinion about this
 haalanki congress kii netaa renuka choudhary kaa kahana he ki yahaan sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi ke bich se kisi ek ko chunane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 He said that we all have to hear his voice and Sonia Gandhi has been leading us since 10 years
 hamaare channel par jab renuka choudhary se hamaare emdi onidyo ne poocha ki adhyaksh pad par koun hoga, puche jane par renuka kaaphi had tak bifer gayi
 He said that the media showed the news of Rahul Gandhi being made the president and where did this rumor come from
 april main rahul gandhi kii 'tajposhi' kii khabaron ko unhone puri tarah se khaarij kar diya he
 According to recent news, Rahul is unlikely to be crowned before September
 vaise kaha yah ja rahaa he ki 19 april ko congress kii aguwai main hone vaali vishaal raily main rahul gandhi bhi shaamil honge
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge for Rahul will be that he will have to win the trust of all the factions of the party
 lekin yah to tab hoga jab vah lautenge, philhal to keval kayaas baaki hai
 The 2019 World Cup has almost reached its halfway mark
 world cap trophy apane naam karne ke liye toornament main hissaa lene vaale 10 desh apana behatar se behatar dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Till June 17, around 9000 runs have been scored in 23 matches played in the World Cup
 saath hi bolors 270 wicket jhatak chuke hai
 Due to the World Cup in England, it was expected that the pitches here would either be flat tracks for batting or would be green tops as per the choice of pace bowlers
 aise main yahi kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki england kii pichon se spinners ko shaayad hi koi laabh mili
 But surprisingly, the current World Cup is giving big things to the spinners as well
 data intelligence unit (DIU) ne hissaa le rahe das deshon kii tiimon ke spinners ke pradarshan kaa vishleshan kiya
 To see how effective they have been so far
 sabhi tiimon main spinners apane pes bolors kaa majboot sahaara sabit ho rahe hai
 On an average, spinners are taking 3 wickets in every match
 kul mila kar ab tak unhone is world cap main 59 wicket liye hai
 All these fell to 20% of 270 wickets
 world cap main hissaa le rahi chaar team aisi hai jinke spinners ne unki team ke kul liye viketon main 30% se zyaada liye hai
 It is interesting that the spinners of Afghanistan have taken wickets equal to the pacers of their team
 vahiin bangladesh or bharat ke spinners ne apni team ke liye kul viketon main kareeb 40% wicket liye hai
 In this context, if we saw the 1999 World Cup in England itself, then the spinners of all the participating teams made only 15% of the total wickets dropped
 us world cap main kul 548 wicket gire the jisamen se 87 wicket hi spinners le sake the
 However, spinners are doing much better in this world
 spinners main sabase behatar pradarshan ab tak dakshin africa ke imran taahir kaa rahaa he
 Tahir has played four matches so far with 8 wickets
 afghanistan ke khilaaf taahir ne 29 ran dekar chaar wicket jatke, isi vajah se afghanistan bahut saste main out ho gaya
 As far as India is concerned, Chinaman bowler Yuzvendra Chahal also took four wickets in the opening match against South Africa
 chahal or taahir donon hi toornament main wicket hadapney ke hisaab se abhi tak top 10 bolers kii fehrist main bane hue hai
 There are 25 matches left in the tournament right now
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki spinners isi tarah kaa behatar pradarshan aage bhi kar pate hai yaa nahin

 Syria, which has been in the fire of civil war for the last several years, has come to a standstill at a strange point
 ek taraf desh main raashtrapati bashar al asad ke khilaaf jari baghawat to vahiin duusari taraf syria par bagdadi kii buree najar
 The Syrian government's chemical attack on its own people on the third side
 ab in sabake bich america kaa syria kii airbase par hawaii hamalaa
 In recent years, hardly any country has experienced a situation where survival is not less than amazing
 neeche die gaye is video main ek ke baad ek tabadatod hamalon kii ye tasviren hai syria kii, jahaan haal hi main hue chemical atake ke baad duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulkon main se ek yani america ne sidhe syrian sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 a large American warship standing in the Mediterranean Sea is continuously targeting Syria's military airbase with dangerous missiles from which innocent cities are accused of carrying out chemical attacks
 duusare tareeqe se kahen to ye america hamalaa darasal haal hi main syria main hue us chemical atake kaa badla he, jisamen kai maasoom bacchon samet sau se zyaada begunaah tadap-tadap kar maare gaye
 This attack after chemical attack is a big thing in itself
 lekin sabase khatarnaak baat ye he ki syria par hue is hamale ko lekar america or rus ek baar phir aamane-saamne aa chuke hai
 Because Russia has been supportive of the Syrian government and especially the President Bashar al-assad right from the beginning
 chemical atake ke liye asad kii fouj kusuuravaris baar bhi beshak puri duniya chemical atake ko lekar asad kii fuj ko kusuuravaar maan rahi ho, magar rus syrian raashtrapati asad ke saath hi khadaa he
 Seeing these painful pictures of the chemical attack in the Syrian town of Khan Shekhaun, the world had already become restless
 chote-chote or maasoom bacchon ke tadapane kii in tasveeron ne jaise har kisi ko jhakzor kar rakh diya tha
 Shortly after these attacks, the US had made it clear that it could not sit silent on it
 raashtrapati donold trump se lekar yues state secretary tak ne naa sirf is hamale kii majammat kii thi, balki rus ko syria ke saath apane rishton ko lekar nae sire se sochane kii salaah bhi de daali
 After this, the United States attacked this and also said that this time the matter will not be just till the end
 guuruuvaar kii raat kareeb paune nau baje america ne kaufanaak tomahok mixilon kaa munh syria kii taraf khol diya or phir ye silsilaa ruk-ruk kar der tak chalata rahaa
 Claims of killing more than 6 Syrian troops were on the target of these missiles, with Holmes's Syrian airbase from where ships were suspected of flying for a chemical attack
 andhere main chamakati ye roshni ekbargi dekhne main khubasurat lag sakati he lekin ye mixilon kii aisi chamak he, jisaki tapish sirf vahi mahasoos kar saktaa he, jo inhen apane aas-paas girte hue dekhtaa he
 Now something similar is happening with the Syrian army
 is hamale ke baad america ne jahaan chah se zyaada syrian fauziyon ke maare jane kaa daawa kiya he, vahiin usne kaha he ki is hamale se usne kai aircraft or fouj ke godaam main rakhe gola barood ko nasht kar diya he
 Talking about Syria, there is an old feud of the government with the rebels there
 isi adaavat main kabhi vidrohi apni tamaam hadon se aage nikal jate hai, to kabhi vahaan kii hukumat ye bhul jaati he ki hukmran hone ke naate unki bhi kuch zimmedaari he
 The incident of the chemical attack in Syria on Tuesday morning is actually the most shocking evidence of the same attitude of Syrian rulers, that is, President Bashar al-assad
 cerin gas se hui thi sau se zyada kii mautsyria par nae sire se hamale kii zamin usee vakt taiyaar ho gai thi, jab mangalvaar ko duniya ne syria main insaaniyat ko bemaut marate hue dekha
 After the chemical attack, more than a hundred people succumbed to the dreaded serine gas, and the worst of them was the small children who could not tolerate the poisoning in the air
 yahi wo taarikh thi, jab america ne saafe kar diya tha ki wo syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad kii zyadatiyon par ab or chup nahin baith saktaa
 The sequence of war between the Syrian army and the rebels is not new
 lekin jab se america main nizaam badla tha, maanon syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad ke raahat bhare din shuru ho gaye the
 The reason is that Russia was already openly standing with Syria, while Russian President Vladimir Putin's relationship with the new US President Donald Trump is considered good
 yahi vajah he ki america lagaataar syria main iesas ke khatme ko to apana target bataa rahaa tha, lekin asad par uski nigahen ab tak tedi nahin hui thi
 Asad's army did this by warning Assad, he did it in a happy manner, which made the whole world stand up against him except in Russia, and this was a chemical attack on his own people in Syria
 vidrohiyon ko sabak sikhaane ke iraade se syrian fuj ne ab tak namaaloom kitne hamale kiye, lekin 4 april kii subah saadhe gyaarah baje syrian toun khan shekhaun main jo kuch hua, wo koi soch nahin saktaa tha
 More than a hundred people, including many children, were killed in a terrifying attack of serine gas, and Assad and his government suddenly came under attack
 ab ise america raashtrapati trump kii majaburi kahen yaa phir kuch or, unhone naa sirf asad ko chetavanee di balki syria par hamalaa bhi kar diya
 On Thursday night, 59 Tomahawk missiles struck Holmes' military airbase in Syria
 vaise america ne is baat ke sanket pehle hi de die the
 While US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson condemned the chemical attack in two words, Russia was also advised to think seriously about giving up with Assad
 sirian patrkaar ne hamale ko bataaya trump kii jhunjhalahattilersan ne kaha ki asad ko apni avam par hukumat karne kaa koi haq nahin rah gaya he
 However, reactions are also coming out against this attack of America
 mashhoor sirian patrkaar wel awwaad kii maane to ye trump ke jhunjhalaahat kii nishaani he, jise yuan security council yani suraksha parishad tak kii manjuuri nahin he
 At the moment, there is hardly any country in this world except Russia, which stands with Assad
 yahi vajah he ki chemical hamale ke baad jahaan asad duniya ke nishane par the, vahiin rus ne ye kah kar safaai di ki syrian fuj ne chemical bam nahin daage, balki uskaa rocket vidrohiyon ke chemical godaam par gira or isse tabaahi machi
 By the way, whatever the world says about the chemical attack in Syria, Bashar al-assad is also not among the people staying
 unhone is hamale ke baad bhi vidrohiyon ke thikaanon par hema ilaake main jamkar bambaari kii, jisamen kai shahriyon ko bhi nishaanaa banaae jane kaa shaq he
 Syrian fighterjets have become junky strips to hangers, and they have been completely destroyed
 chah se zyaada fauziyon kii jaane bhi gayi
 Whereas most of the Syrian fighter jets on the airbase became junk upon seeing them
 yakeenan ye syria or uski fouj ke liye ek bada jhatka he
 These deathblows shone on the Syrian skies on Thursday night causing such devastation on the ground that the next morning when the rays of the sun reached the earth, there were scattered signs of catastrophe
 america kii kaufanaak tomahok mixilon ke 59 waar ne jahaan 6 syrian fauziyon kii jaan le lee, vahiin 9 ladaaku vimaanon ko bhi hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye kabad main tabdeel kar diya
 The pictures that came out of Holmes' Syrian airbase in the morning were telling the story of the devastation of the night
 kai jagahon par hanger ke neeche khadey hawaii jahaaz ke upar kancreet ke hanger kaa malba kuch aisa gira ki hawaii jahaaj khadey-khadey kabad gaye
 Moreover, a portion of Syria's ammunition reserves were also destroyed in the attack of American missiles
 america ne syrian airbase par machaai tabaahisiria ke faujee airbase par hamale ko lekar kayaas to kair lagaae jane lage the ki ek rusi tivi channel ne aisi kai tasveeron ke saath ye daawa kiya ki is hamale se nau syrian ladaaku jahaaz tabah ho gaye
 Some areas of the runway and air strip were also seen broken in some photographs
 america ne guuruuvaar kii raat ko syria ke paas bumadhya sagar main tainaat apane ek jangi jahaaz se syria ke faujee airbase ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 While the Trump administration may have termed these attacks as a lesson to Syrian President Bashar al-assad, experts believe that this US attack has increased tensions in the region
 vaise syria ke maujuuda halaat ke bich sabase badi vidambnaa ye bhi he ki itane bade paimaane hue chemical atake ke baavjood yuan security council yani sanyukt raashtra sangh kaa suraksha parishad is hamale kii jaanch par ek raay nahin ho sakaa
 In such a situation, the question is still a secret as to who is the real culprit behind the chemical attack? IS also started the game of death and it is a matter of fact that the world considers the President of Syria as innocent behind this attack
 syrian sarkaar or vidrohiyon kii ladaai se syria kii aam janata jujh hi rahi thi
 Meanwhile, IS also started a game of death
 uskaa khamiyaja syria kii janata ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Would you believe that millions of Syrians have lost their lives in civil war, Baghdadi and other factions
 syria ke lakhon log is vakt khun ke aansu ro rahe hai
 On the one hand, Syrian President Bashar al-assad is not willing to give up his throne at any cost, on the other hand the people of the Lebanese and Hezbollah faction want to overthrow the Syrian President
 is ladaai main syria kii aam janata pis rahi he
 According to an estimate, more than three lakh people have been killed so far in the ongoing bloody conflict in Syria
 sanyukt raashtra ne 2013-2014 ke jo aankade jari kiye the, uske anusaar takreeban 93 hazaar logon kii maut kii khabar saamne aa chuki thi or ab ye aankada dinon-din badhata ja rahaa he
 The fight intensified after the chemical attack, the UN Human Rights Organization says that people are dying every month in Syria
 jabaki ab tak ek karod se zyaada beghar ho chuke hai
 Baghdadi's organization IS alone has killed thousands of innocents in Syria
 ab tak syria main rus bhi lagaataar hawaii hamale kar asad kii gaddi ko bachaana chahta tha
 The general Syrians also fell prey to the rebels in Russian airstrikes
 syria main bhukhmaree or maut ke aankade dinon-din badhate ja rahe hai
 If this bloody conflict does not stop in time, Syria will be completely ruined
 kul milakar chemical atake ke baad syria kii ladaai or bhi tej ho gai he, or ye kab or kahaan ja kar khatm hogi, philhal koi nahin jaanata

 Perhaps there is a huge reduction in the number of bureaucrats
 yah kami kitni vikaraal he, iskaa 4 july ko loksabhaa main kendriya shram or rojgaar mantri santosh gangavar ke jawaab se hi andaja lagata he ki march 2018 main takreeban 7,00,000 sarkari pad khaali the
 Of this, 2,60,000 posts were vacant only in Railways
 in khaali padon ko bharne kaa ek tarika 'pichley daravaaje se bhartee' he
 That is, the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) standard procedure should be done away with and recruitment should be done directly from the private sector

 chandramauli ne is saal june main afasaron se iees ke up-sachiv or nideshak str ke padon par nijee kshetra ke visheshgyon kii bhartee ke liye ek prastaav taiyaar karne ko kaha
 According to sources, a total of 40 such specialist officers are likely to be appointed through backdoor
 yahaan tak ki centre sarkaar kii think tanks niti ayog bhi up-sachiv or nideshak str ke padon par aisi hi bhartiyon karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 a draft NITI Aayog report on reforms in the administrative service says, "due to the complexities of the economy, there is a great need for expertise in policy-making
" lihaaja, yah behad jaruri he ki prashasnic tantra main visheshgyon kii bhartee kii jaae
 Another beneficial effect of backdoor recruitment will be that competition will also arise for bureaucrats coming through the administrative service process
 ''nai charchaa, purana nuskhaahalanki prashasnic sevaaon main pichley daravaaje se bhartee nayaa vichaar nahin he
 It has been used extensively and in the governments of the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand as well as in many countries of the European Union
 apane desh main bhi iskaa prastaav kai varsh pehle 2001 main aayaa tha
 The report of the Administrative Service Examination Review Committee of the Central Public Service Commission (UPSC) headed by the then noted economist Yogendra Alagh recommended backdoor recruitment to the middle and top ranks of the bureaucracy
 phir, 2005 main virappa moili kii adhyakshata main duusare prashasnic sudhaar ayog (earsi) ne sifarish kii ki centre or rajya sarkaron ke prashasnic padon par pichley daravaaje se bhartee ke liye sansthagat or paardarshee prakriya sthapit kii jaae
 The following year Justice B
 en
 The Sixth Central Pay Commission report, led by Sri Krishna, reiterated the same recommendation and said that recruitment from the back door would "ensure the entry and retention of talent in administrative services"
 pehle bhi aisi mashhoor najiren rahi hai jab prashasan ke sheersh paaydaanon par behad kaabil peshewar logon ko pichley daravaaje se dakhila diya gaya he
 In this list, former Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh, montek singh ahaluwalia, raghuram rajan, urjit patel, arvind pangadipha, arvind subrahmïnyam or nandan nilkeni ke alaava or bhi kai log shaamil hai
 However, due to the resistance of the powerful IAS lobby and the institution of the institutions, these recommendations have so far been adorned on paper or stuck in administrative latecomers
 masalan, pichley saal june main endie sarkaar ne sanyukt sachiv str ke padon par nijee kshetra ke peshewaron kii bhartee kii sifarish kii thi
 In April this year, UPSC selected nine professionals for these vacant posts
 baavjood is hakeekat ke is fehrist main iity or iiem ke purv chaatr, rods scollar or oxford sareekhee pratishthit sansthaaon ke graduate shaamil the, unamem se kisi ko bhi ab tak niyukt nahin kiya gaya he
 Even though these proposals were made earlier, but the formal policy decision of the Modi government for recruitment from backdoor on a large scale is an ambitious and out of the box effort to solve this problem
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki is kadam kii shuruyaat niti ayog kii 2017 kii ek report se hui, jisamen is baat kii taraf dhyaan dilaayaa gaya tha ki prashasnic vyavastha main visheshgyon kii pichley daravaaje se bhartee kis kadar jaruri he
 It was also introduced as a solution to the acute shortage of senior bureaucrats, especially in the IAS, which has only 5,004 such officers while the sanctioned posts are 6,500
 afasaron kii is kami se prabhavit police or nyaaypalika sareekhe duusare kshetra bhi hai
 This deficiency is particularly severe in the states of Hindi belt, which include Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Rajasthan
 hindustan ke sabase zyada aabaadi vaale rajya uttar pradesh main, 2016 ke ek adhyayan ke mutabik, kul kami 43 fisadi he
 Advocates of the 'minimum government' on recruitment often talk of not filling vacant positions by telling the bureaucracy to be inordinate
 unki daleel he ki prashasnic sevaaon main pehle se hi bahut zyada log hai
 However, public administration experts do not agree with this and say that there is a severe shortage of qualified people and experts in the Indian administrative services
 yah nittefaki bhi ek badi vajah rahi jiske chalate sarkari padon ko bharne ke tareeke ke taur par pichley daravaaje se bhartee par amal kaa kaam itani sust rakrataar se aage bad sakaa
 The second point of contention is related to the role of bureaucracy in the success of India
 pichley daravaaje se bhartee ke pakshdhar hotmel ke sansthaapak sabir bhaatia kehete hai ki hindustan ne kuch shandaar or raashtra kaa kayapalat kar dene vaali kamyaabiyaan hasil kin, jinamein afasarshahi kaa koi yogadan nahin rahaa
 According to his plea, these include green revolution, space and nuclear power programs, introduction of Aadhaar and Unified Payment Interface, regulation of telecom sector and liberalization of financial sector and more

 Shailaja Chandra, who has held the rank of Secretary in the Government, goes on to argue that "backdoor recruitment in areas of expertise like finance, accounting, taxation, legal matters, disinvestment and budget making, procurement and revenue collection" Can matter a lot
 ve kahati hai, ''aise kshetron main bich ke str par pichley daravaaje se bhartee hue log aisi kaabiliyat lekar aa sakate hai jo iees afasaron yaa group e ke afasaron ke paas nahin hai
 However, she also says, "IAS service is very important for the functioning of the government
" pichley daravaaje se bhartee hue log kabhi isaki jagah nahin le sakate
 "it warns," she warns, "that the process should not change constantly" between the government and the private sector, audit and chartered accountancy companies and industry think tanks exchanged between people
 alabatta varisht afasarshah aisi daleelon ke mul aadhaar se ittefaq nahin rakhte or kehete hai ki sarkaar ke bheetar kaa jo tajurba or sarkari prakriyaaon kaa jo gyaan iees afasaron ke paas he, vah bhi visheshgyata kaa hi ek rup he, jo ho saktaa he ki nijee kshetra ke peshewaron ke paas shaayad na ho
 Apart from this, the private sector experts cannot take care of the public interest the way the IAS fraternity does
 naam na chhapane kii shart par ek mukhya sachiv kehete hai, ''baahar kii pratibhaaen niti nirmaan or jamini str par amal ke bich kii khai iees adhikariyon kii tarah nahin paat sakati
 Critics within the bureaucracy also argue that back-door recruitment is unconstitutional and against public interest and is likely to sidestep the reservation system that ensures a fair level of representation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes

 "the economy of India has grown at a rapid pace in recent years, but the quality of the country's bureaucracy is widely either sluggish or deteriorating," writes the author in The 2016 Meets Big Data, a 2016 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
 It is considered ", and also," IAS political interference is battered by the poor record of implementation of outdated personnel procedures and policies and it needs to be reformed immediately

 Raghav Chadha, the young candidate of Aam Aadmi Party from South Delhi, is getting a lot of proposals for weddings through social media
 jab se aam aadmi party ne apane yuva netaa raghav chaddha ko dakshini dilli se ummidavaar banaaya he tab se unke tivetor, fasebuk, instagram, email or watsape par shaadiyon ke prastaav kii bharmaar lag gai he
 Most of the proposals have been sent by the girls themselves
 raghav chaddha kii team ke mutabik ladkiyaan unhen kahin alag alag imoji bhejti hai to kahin sidhe sidhe shaadi karne kaa prastaav bhi bhej rahi hai
 As soon as the young leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party stood for the election of the MP, the line of marriage relations has been put behind them
 soshal media ke jariye kahin ladakiyon ne unhen khud prapoj kiya to kai email main yaa online ladakiyon ke parivaar waalon ne unhen shaadi kaa rishta bhej diya
 a 30-year-old AAP candidate from South Delhi, Raghav Chadha, told Aaj Tak on this question, "my focus right now is on contesting
 main baaki or kisi baat par dhyaan nahin de rahaa hum
 "however, Raghav Chadha's team accepted the marriage proposal being received by the young leader and said that proposals were coming on all his social media platforms
 maharashtra se aam aadmi party kii netaa priti sharma ne bhi raghav chaddha ko achaanak ladakiyon se milane vaale prastaav par chutki lee he
 He wrote on social media, "whatever happens to the election, our boy's house will be settled

 Arvind Kejriwal, a key member of Team Anna, has attacked the Narendra Modi government on the issue of corruption, saying that there is an open game of corruption in Gujarat, but instead of allowing Chief Minister Modi to prosecute his people, he is patronizing them 
 yah puche jane par ki modi bhrasht hai, to kejariwal ne kaha ki meraa paas koi saboot nahin he jiske aadhaar par kaha ja sake ki modi bhrasht hai, lekin modi bhrashtachar ke aarope se ghire apane cabinet sahyogiyon ko sangrakshan de rahe hai
 He is not allowing them to prosecute and has not been appointing Lokayukta for the past nine years
 unhone kaha ki nau saal se gujarat kii sarkaar lokayukta kii niyukti nahin kar rahi he, lekin is mudde par vah raajnneeti kar rahi he
 If the Modi government is serious about creating a corruption-free state, it should appoint a Lokayukta
 kejariwal ne sawaal kiya ki agar yahaan mantri athwa pradhan sachiv bhrashtachar main lipt hai to unki jaanch koun karegaa
 Kejriwal said that there is a very serious situation in Gujarat that there is no institution to investigate corruption cases of ministers and top officials
 yah sthiti beete nau varshon se bani hui he
 It seems that dealing with corruption is not a priority for the BJP government of Gujarat
 yahaan sabakuch khulaa chal rahaa he
 Kejriwal has come here to support the movement against land acquisition in Lavad village in Gandhinagar district
 unhone haal hi main gujarat ke mantri purushottam solanki ke khilaaf praathmiki darj karne se modi ke manaa karne kaa zikr kiya

 Although Sachin was not ready for this, but how could Yuvraj miss this opportunity? ipel main pichley paanch maichon se yuvaraj singh ke balle ko ran kii talash rahi, pichley paanch maichon main unka nijee score kabhi 25 ke paar nahin gaya
 It can be said by coincidence that Yuvi got his form by getting blessings

 129
 5 ke strike rate se khelte hue yuvi ne is pari ne 7 chauke or 2 chakke lagaae

 India is also considering various economic and diplomatic measures to isolate Pakistan after the surgical strikes against terrorists across the Line of Control (loc) by the Indian Army
 uri hamale ke baad se pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nai dilli ke badhate aarthik or rajanyik prabhaav kaa upyog kiya he
 Significantly, Pakistan is one-fifth of India in size while its economy is equal to one-seventh of our economy
 tippaniyan On condition of anonymity, a security official said that our new stand would be aggressive rather than defensive
 iske tahat bharat, pakistan kii arthvastha, aantarik suraksha va antarrashtriya chhavi ko ujagar karte hue use ek asthir or aatanki samoohon ke thikaane ke rup main sthapit karne par jor degaa
 Along with this, the option of ending trade with Pakistan is also being considered
 yah vyapaar sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) jaise tisare desh ke ke jariye bhi hota he
 However it is very limited and in favor of India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main pakistan ko alag -thalag karne ke yah upaay purvavarti sarkaar kii tulana main adhik aakraamak he haalanki visheshgyon kii raay he ki inase donon deshon ke bich tanaav or bad saktaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used the growing economic and diplomatic influence of New Delhi to isolate Pakistan since the Uri attack
 gauratlab he ki aakaar main pakistan, bharat kaa paanchvaan hissaa he jabaki uski arthvyavastha hamaari arthvyavastha ke saatven hisse ke baraabar he
 The comments naam ujagar nahin karne kii shart par ek suraksha adhikari ne bataaya ki hamaara nayaa rukh rakshaatmak ke bajaay aakraamak hoga
 Under this, India will emphasize Pakistan's economy, internal security and international image, and establish it as a hideout and hideout of terrorist groups
 iske saath hi pakistan ke saath vyapaar ko khatm karne kaa vikalp par bhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 This trade also takes place through a third country such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
 haalanki yah behad simit or bharat ke paksh main he
 This measure to isolate Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more aggressive than the previous government, although experts are of the opinion that these could further increase tensions between the two countries

 kya madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan, sumitra mahajan or kailash vijayawargeey kii seat kaa suspence bijepi ke liye uljhan ban gaya he? maujuuda halaat main jin teen siton bhopal, indore or vidisha ke ummidavaaron kaa naam hold par rakhaa gaya ye teenon bijepi kii teen dashak se kabje vaali siten hai
 Three veterans have upset the BJP equations in these three seats
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi 29 main se 18 ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan to kar chuki he lekin maathapai inhen teen damdaar yaa yun kahen ki bijepi kaa garh maani jaani vaali siton par chal rahi he
 These seats are believed to be none other than those who spoil the bjp's equation, ie Mama i
e
 former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Tai ie Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and Bhai i
e
 bjp's National General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya
 aise main mukhyamantri kamalnath is par chutki lete hue kah rahe hai ki bijepi ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 He is suggesting that the BJP take out advertisements for the candidate
 patrakaron ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party kaa pasinaa utar rahaa he or ab iske liye koun sa candidet ladayenge iskaa vigyaapan nikaale to shaayad bijepi ko ummidavaar mil jayega
 Digvijay's bets from Bhopal: In the three seats for which the Congress is tightening the tensions of Mama, Tai and Bhai on BJP, Digvijay Singh, who has been the Chief Minister for 10 years from the Congress, is in the fray from here
 isliye is par khinchataan do naamon ko lekar he, mamaa yani shivaraj or bhai yani kailash vijayawargeey
 At the same time, Tai, who has been winning elections from Indore for nearly 30 years, is running between Sumitra Mahajan and Takrar Bhai i
e
 Kailash Vijayvargiya
 to videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke chunaav nahin ladane ke elaan ke baad ab vidisha seat se purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii patni sadhana singh kaa pech ulajhaa he
 This is the reason why the BJP has not been able to decide which of the three seats to contest
 aise main bijepi netaa gopal bhargav kaa kahana he ki tai, bhai or mamaa loktantr kaa hissaa nahin hai, teenon bijepi kii paramparaagat siten hai
 Our candidate is a lotus flower, the party BJP and the leader is just Narendra Modi
 bhargav ne kaha ki 'loktantr main main jahaan tak maanata hum ki koi tai koi bhai koi mamaa nahin hota he
 Individuals are not important in Bharatiya Janata Party, no one will contest from there
 teenon hi bijepi kii paramparaagat siten hai kareeb teen dashak se yahaan ham jeet rahe hai, koi bhi chunaav ladega, jeet hamaari hogi
 However, whatever may be in the political discussion, the BJP is realizing that it is a big challenge for the party to retain the existing 26 seats out of 29 seats in the Lok Sabha after the defeat in the assembly elections
 sabase badi mushkil he ki pech bhi un siton par ulajh rahaa he jo ab tak bijepi kaa garh maani jaati hai
 In such a situation, the squabble between the senior leaders of BJP itself may spoil the mathematics of the BJP
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter bihar vidhansabha chunaavon kii adhisuchana ab kisi bhi din chunaav ayog kii ghoshnaa ke saath jari ho sakati he
 In this country, every political party, every politician, every political worker is just waiting for the result of Bihar election
 lekin is chunaav main mudda kya hoga? kya ye chunaav pradhanmantri narendra modi or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke ab tak ke daavon ke anusaar vikaas ke mudde par ladaa jayega yaa lalu yadav ke gandhi maidan main swabhimaan raily main bhaashan ke anusaar mandal 2 kii vaapasi ke sawaal par? yaa mudda kuch or he, jisase is khel main shaamil har pramukh khilaadi ke man main hichak ho rahi he
 This is the case
 ye pehla chunaav he jahaan vikaas mudda nahin, kyonki vikaas ke paimaane par nitish or narendra modi donon khare utarate hai
 The only similarity in the political career of both is that whenever they got an opportunity, they drew such a line of development from their leadership, which their opponents were also convinced
 tab sawaal he ki aakhir vah koun sa mudda he jisane bihar ke chunavi itihaas main aisa vyaktigat or hai profile, hai tech prachaar abhiyaan nahin dekha
 After all, what is the issue that Prime Minister Narendra Modi holds five election meetings in Bihar before the elections, his entire cabinet has revolved around every corner of Bihar
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa se purv 150 se zyada prachaar rath bihar ke har gaanv kaa daura kar chuke hai
 What is the point that Nitish Kumar does not miss the opportunity to campaign in social media from Facebook to Twitter and attack his opponents, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aakhir ye koun sa aisa mudda he ki nitish kumaar, lalu yadav or congress netaaon ke ghar jate hai or apane samarthakon ke tamaam virodh ke baavjood unhen manamaani seat bhi dete hai
 Actually, the only issue of this Bihar assembly election is revenge, revenge and reimbursement, so that your political opponents should enjoy the biggest defeat in political life and these opponents are Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar
 lekin aap sawaal karenge ki narendra modi pichley hi saal nitish kumaar ko loksabhaa chunaav main dhul chataakar pradhanmantri kii kursi paa chuke hai tab ye tark kyon
 The question is simple, but perhaps even after his victory and sitting on the Prime Minister's chair, Narendra Modi has not forgotten that he has got three elections in Bihar - November 2005 assembly elections, 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 2010 assembly elections
 Kept away from campaigning
 or in teenon chunavon main nitish ke netritv main siton kii sankhya badi
 It is different that even when votes were sought in Modi's name in last year's Lok Sabha elections, his coalition got the most seats in Bihar
 lekin modi maatr isse santusht hone vaale netaaon main se nahin or vidhansabha chunaavon main wo ek baar phir sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki agar bihar kii janata bahumat kaa aankada rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan (endie) kii jholii main de rahi thi tab usamen nitish ek mukhauta maatr the
 And even if no local leader is projected, as is happening in this time's election, Narendra Modi can still get the majority figure in Bihar
 or shaayad modi usase bhi zyada ek vigyaapan ke kaaran unke bina bhoj main aamantran kii shart ko bhi bhul nahin paa rahe hai yaa nitish kumaar ne gujarat sarkaar ke 5 karod kii kosi sahaayta kii raashi lautaai
 These are the three reasons why Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to miss the opportunity to take revenge on Nitish Kumar once again
 pradhanmantri modi badla lene ke liye kitna gambhir hai, iske liye aap dekh sakate hai ki pichley ek maheene main unhone har wo kadam uthaae hai jinhen karne ke liye unke upar maheenon se yaa maang kii ja rahi thi yaa dabaab daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Be it the decision to withdraw the land acquisition bill, or the matter of pending One Rank One Pension for ex-servicemen, or the chance to visit mosques in Arab countries, or announce a package of more than 1 lakh crores for Bihar
 Ho
 sabake peeche ek hi tark diya gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bihar ke chunaavon main pratishtha daanv par lagi he isliye vah nahin chaahate ki nitish kii aguwai vaale gathbandhan ko koi laabh mili
 In fact, he does not want to avoid any spices to win in his revenge script and if Prime Minister Modi said something wrong in Nitish's DNA in Muzaffarpur, or there is electricity in Bihar despite the improved state of electricity, the communication of electricity came All of this shows their vain revenge
 ab baat nitish kumaar kii
 Not only is he resigned from getting just 2 seats in the Lok Sabha elections last year, and he feels that if he wins the assembly elections, then he can be accounted for by Narendra Modi
 shuddh shabdon main kahen to badla liya ja saktaa he
 After the results of Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Nitish had believed that staying or appearing with Modi in this country can only give adverse results especially in Bihar's political scenario
 unki is dharna ko 2005 november, 2009 loksabhaa parinaam or 2010 ke vidhansabha ke nateezon se or bal mila
 And on this basis and on the advice of some top BJP leaders, he has bypassed the BJP on the issue of Narendra Modi, but he made a mistake, not believing his pro-voters about his campaign against Modi
 Was able to take
 khaskar jis muslim or ati pichhadaa samudaay ke samarthan kii ummid par unhone bijepi se naata todaa, usne unhen vidhansabha chunaavon tak intjaar kaa vaada kar loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 But Nitish also has to take revenge, so Nitish is adopting the policy of being an enemy of the enemy
 pehle lalu yadav se apane sambandhon main samvadaheenata khatm kii or samarthan lekar rajyasabha chunaavon main apni party ke ummidavaaron kii jeet tay kar izzat bachaai, phir vidhansabha up chunaavon main siton kaa talmail kiya or baad main vahi formula apana kar vidhansabha ke honevaale chunaavon ke liye siton kaa talmail bhi kar daalaa
 It is different that in this politics of revenge, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is now angry with Nitish's close proximity to Congress Party and especially Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 mulaayam kii naaraazgi kitni mahangi padegi, lekin ha chunavon ke purv unhone rang main bhaang daalane kaa kaam jarur karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The comments nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se badla lene ke liye ek se ek kai aise faisle liye hai, jo shaayad aam dinon main vah khud uske bade aalochak hote
 He first showed his party's Bahubali MLA Anant Singh the way to jail
 ye tark diya ja rahaa he ki anant singh apane kaarnon se jail gaye lekin sab jaanate hai ki anant singh agar ek yadav jati ke bachche kii hatya main aaropee na hote or na hi lalu yadav use pratishtha kaa prashn banaaya hota to patna police ne anant singh ke khilaaf ye karwaai nahin kii hoti
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar's government included many castes like Teli among the most backward castes, while many castes like the dominant backward castes like Mallah accepted the demand for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes
 iske alaava contract par kaam karne vaale shikshakon ko vetanman dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Accepting the demand of increasing the salary of every section who has been appointed on the contract, it shows how serious Nitish is towards his revenge politics
 darasal nitish ke mahagathbandhan ko maaloom he ki is chunaav main har ek vot mahatvurna he
 It is also considered a part of Nitish's politics to accept the demand of most women voters to implement the policy of prohibition of alcohol for years
 lekin jahaan narendra modi se badla lene kii aguwai bhale nitish kar rahe hon, lekin nitish se badla lene ke liye wo chaahe purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi hon yaa ramvilas paswan yaa upendra kushvaha, sabhi agar aaj narendra modi or bijepi ke ishaare par chal rahe hai to unka ek hi lakshya he ki kisi bhi tarah nitish kumaar se badla liya jaye
 And for this, there cannot be a better captain than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, nor is there a better party than BJP in every respect
 lekin nitish ke peeche khadey lalu yadav or congress sab jaanate hai ki aaj kii raajnneeti main or vah bhi bihar ke akhaade main nitish kumaar se behatar modi se badla lene ke liye unki team kaa cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 But what will be the issue in this election? Will this election be fought on the issue of development as per the claims made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or on the question of return of Mandal 2 according to Lalu Yadav's speech at Swabhimaan rally at Gandhi Maidan? Or the issue is something else, which is causing reluctance in every major player involved in this game
 baat kuch aisi hi he
 This is the first election where development is not an issue as both Nitish and Narendra Modi live up to the scale of development
 donon ke raajnneetik kariyar main yahi ek samanta he ki jab bhi inhen mauka mila, inhone apane netritv se vikaas kii ek aisi lakeer khinchi, jiske inke virdohi bhi kaayal rahe
 Then the question is, what is the issue that has not seen such a personal and high profile, high tech campaign in the electoral history of Bihar
 aakhir ye koun sa mudda he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi chunaavon ke purv bihar main paanch chunavi sabha kar daalate hai, unki puri cabinet bihar ke har sudur kone kii parikrama kar chuki he
 More than 150 campaigning chariots have visited every village in Bihar before the election announcement
 ye aakhir koun sa mudda he ki nitish kumaar soshal media main fasebuk se twitor tak prachaar or apane virodhiyon khaskar pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamale karne kaa mauka nahin chhodte
 After all, what is the point that Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav and Congress leaders go home and give them arbitrary seats despite the opposition of their supporters
 darasal is bihar vidhansabha chunaav kaa ek hi mudda he badla, badla or hisaab-kitaab chukaane vaala badla, jisase apane raajnneetik virdohi ko raajnneetik jivan kii sabase badi haar kaa majaa chakhaaya jaae or ye virdohi hai narendra modi or nitish kumaar
 But you will question why Narendra Modi has got Nitish Kumar the Prime Minister's chair in the Lok Sabha elections last year, then why this argument
 sawaal laazmi he, lekin shaayad apni jeet or pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke baad bhi narendra modi is baat ko nahin bhuule hai ki unhen bihar main teen chunaavon - 2005 ke november ke vidhansabha chunaav, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav - ke prachaar abhiyaan se dur rakhaa gaya
 And in these three elections, the number of seats increased under Nitish's leadership
 ye baat alag he ki jab pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon main modi ke naam par vot maange gaye, tab bhi bihar main unke gathbandhan ko sarvaadhik siten milin
 But Modi is not just one of the leaders to be satisfied with this and in the assembly elections he wants to prove once again that if the people of Bihar were giving majority figures to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), then Nitish was just a mask
 
 or agar kisi sthaneey netaa ko project nahin bhi kiya jaae, jaisaa is baar ke chunaav main ab tak ho rahaa he, tab bhi bihar main narendra modi bahumat kaa aankada dilaa sakate hai
 And perhaps Modi is unable to forget the condition of inviting him to the banquet because of an advertisement even more than that or Nitish Kumar returned Kosi assistance of 5 crores of Gujarat government
 ye teen aise kaaran hai, jiske chalate pradhanmantri narendra modi nitish kumaar se ek baar phir badla lene kaa mauka nahin chuknaa chaahate
 For how serious Prime Minister Modi is to take revenge, you can see that in the last one month, he has taken every step which he was being demanded or pressurized for months
 wo chaahe bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko waapas lene kaa nirnay ho, yaa purv sainikon ke liye lambit van rank van pension kaa maamla, yaa arab desho kii yatra main masjid jane kaa mauka, yaa phir bihar ke liye 1 lakh karod se adhik ke package kii ghoshnaa ho
 The reasoning behind all this is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reputation is at stake in Bihar elections, so he does not want the Nitish-led coalition to get any benefit
 darasal wo apane badale kii script main jeet ke liye kisi bhi masaale se parhez nahin karnaa chaahate or agar pradhanmantri modi ne mujffarpur main nitish ke diene main khot bataaya, yaa bihar main bijli kii sudhari haalat ke baavjood logon se bijli he, bijli ai kaa samvaad ye sab kahin na kahin unki badla lene kii betaabi ko darshata he
 Now Nitish Kumar talks
 vah naa keval pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main maatr 2 siten milane se khaar khaae baithe hai, or unhen lag rahaa he ki agar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet mil jaae to narendra modi se hisaab baraabar kiya ja saktaa he
 In pure words, it can be changed
 nitish 2004 main loksabhaa chunavon ke parinaam aane ke baad se ye maan baithe the ki is desh main modi ke saath rahanaa yaa dikhnaa khaskar bihar ke rajantik paridrishy par pratikul parinaam hi de saktaa he
 His belief was further strengthened by the 2005 November 2009 Lok Sabha results and the 2010 Assembly results
 or isi aadhaar par or bijepi ke kuch sheersh netaaon kii salaah par unhone narendra modi ke mudde par bijepi ko by-by to kar hi daalaa, lekin unhone ek chook kii, modi ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan ke bare main apane samarthak votaron ko vishwaas main nahin le paae
 Especially the Muslim and extremely backward community on which he broke away from the BJP in the hope of support, he promised him to wait till the assembly elections and supported the RJD and BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin badla nitish ko bhi lenaa he, isliye nitish dushman kaa dushman dost hota he vaali niti apana rahe hai
 First ended the lack of communication in his relations with Lalu Yadav and secured the honor of deciding the victory of his party candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections, then coordinated the seats in the assembly by-elections and later adopted the same formula for the seats for the assembly elections
 It also coordinated
 ye baat alag he ki badale kii is raajnneeti main nitish ke congress party or khaskar sonia gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se najdiki se samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab naaraaz hai
 Mulayam's displeasure will be very expensive, but before Ha Chunav, he has definitely done the work of adding hemp to the color
 tippaniyan Nitish has taken many decisions one by one to take revenge on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he himself would have been a big critic of in the ordinary days
 sabase pehle unhone apane party ke bahubali vidhayak anant singh ko jail kaa rasta dikhaaya
 It is being argued that Anant Singh went to jail for his own reasons, but everyone knows that if Anant Singh was not an accused in the murder of a Yadav caste child nor did Lalu Yadav make him a question of prestige, then Patna Police It would not have been taken against iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana
 Also announced a pay scale for the teachers working on the contract
 har vah tabaka jisaki niyukti anubandh par hui he, unke vetan badhaane kii maang ko maananaa ye dikhaata he ki nitish apane badale kii raajnneeti ke prati kitna gambheer hai
 Actually, Nitish's grand alliance knows that every single vote is important in this election
 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But where Nitish may be leading the revenge of Narendra Modi, but whether he is former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are going to be at the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP today
 His only goal is to somehow get revenge on Nitish Kumar
 or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se badhiya captain nahin ho saktaa or na hi bijepi se acchhee koi har maamle main suvidha sampann party
 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 baat kuch aisi hi he
 This is the first election where development is not an issue as both Nitish and Narendra Modi live up to the scale of development
 donon ke raajnneetik kariyar main yahi ek samanta he ki jab bhi inhen mauka mila, inhone apane netritv se vikaas kii ek aisi lakeer khinchi, jiske inke virdohi bhi kaayal rahe

 Now Nitish Kumar talks
 vah naa keval pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main maatr 2 siten milane se khaar khaae baithe hai, or unhen lag rahaa he ki agar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet mil jaae to narendra modi se hisaab baraabar kiya ja saktaa he

 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But while the leaders are not seeking to take revenge on Narendra Modi , whether they are former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are following the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP to take revenge on Nitish
 So his only goal is to somehow get revenge on Nitish Kumar
 or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se badhiya captain nahin ho saktaa or na hi bijepi se acchhee koi har maamle main suvidha sampann party
 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 tab sawaal he ki aakhir vah koun sa mudda he jisane bihar ke chunavi itihaas main aisa vyaktigat or hai profile, hai tech prachaar abhiyaan nahin dekha
 After all, what is the issue that Prime Minister Narendra Modi holds five election meetings in Bihar before the elections, his entire cabinet has revolved around every corner of Bihar
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa se purv 150 se zyada prachaar rath bihar ke har gaanv kaa daura kar chuke hai
 What is the point that Nitish Kumar does not miss the opportunity to campaign in social media from Facebook to Twitter and attack his opponents, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aakhir ye koun sa aisa mudda he ki nitish kumaar, lalu yadav or congress netaaon ke ghar jate hai or apane samarthakon ke tamaam virodh ke baavjood unhen manamaani seat bhi dete hai
 Actually, the only issue of this Bihar assembly election is revenge, revenge and reimbursement, so that your political opponents should enjoy the biggest defeat in political life and these opponents are Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar
 lekin aap sawaal karenge ki narendra modi pichley hi saal nitish kumaar ko loksabhaa chunaav main dhul chataakar pradhanmantri kii kursi paa chuke hai tab ye tark kyon
 The question is simple, but perhaps even after his victory and sitting on the Prime Minister's chair, Narendra Modi has not forgotten that he has got three elections in Bihar - November 2005 assembly elections, 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 2010 assembly elections
 Kept away from campaigning
 or in teenon chunavon main nitish ke netritv main siton kii sankhya badi
 It is different that even when votes were sought in Modi's name in last year's Lok Sabha elections, his coalition got the most seats in Bihar
 lekin modi maatr isse santusht hone vaale netaaon main se nahin or vidhansabha chunaavon main wo ek baar phir sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki agar bihar kii janata bahumat kaa aankada rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan (endie) kii jholii main de rahi thi tab usamen nitish ek mukhauta maatr the
 And even if no local leader is projected, as is happening in this time's election, Narendra Modi can still get the majority figure in Bihar
 or shaayad modi usase bhi zyada ek vigyaapan ke kaaran unke bina bhoj main aamantran kii shart ko bhi bhul nahin paa rahe hai yaa nitish kumaar ne gujarat sarkaar ke 5 karod kii kosi sahaayta kii raashi lautaai
 These are the three reasons why Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to miss the opportunity to take revenge on Nitish Kumar once again
 pradhanmantri modi badla lene ke liye kitna gambhir hai, iske liye aap dekh sakate hai ki pichley ek maheene main unhone har wo kadam uthaae hai jinhen karne ke liye unke upar maheenon se yaa maang kii ja rahi thi yaa dabaab daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Be it the decision to withdraw the land acquisition bill, or the matter of pending One Rank One Pension for ex-servicemen, or the chance to visit mosques in Arab countries, or announce a package of more than 1 lakh crores for Bihar
 Ho
 sabake peeche ek hi tark diya gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bihar ke chunaavon main pratishtha daanv par lagi he isliye vah nahin chaahate ki nitish kii aguwai vaale gathbandhan ko koi laabh mili
 In fact, he does not want to avoid any spices to win in his revenge script and if Prime Minister Modi said something wrong in Nitish's DNA in Muzaffarpur, or there is electricity in Bihar despite the improved state of electricity, the communication of electricity came All of this shows their vain revenge
 ab baat nitish kumaar kii
 Not only is he resigned from getting just 2 seats in the Lok Sabha elections last year, and he feels that if he wins the assembly elections, then he can be accounted for by Narendra Modi
 shuddh shabdon main kahen to badla liya ja saktaa he
 After the results of Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Nitish had believed that staying or appearing with Modi in this country can only give adverse results especially in Bihar's political scenario
 unki is dharna ko 2005 november, 2009 loksabhaa parinaam or 2010 ke vidhansabha ke nateezon se or bal mila
 And on this basis and on the advice of some top BJP leaders, he has bypassed the BJP on the issue of Narendra Modi, but he made a mistake, not believing his pro-voters about his campaign against Modi
 Was able to take
 khaskar jis muslim or ati pichhadaa samudaay ke samarthan kii ummid par unhone bijepi se naata todaa, usne unhen vidhansabha chunaavon tak intjaar kaa vaada kar loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 But Nitish also has to take revenge, so Nitish is adopting the policy of being an enemy of the enemy
 pehle lalu yadav se apane sambandhon main samvadaheenata khatm kii or samarthan lekar rajyasabha chunaavon main apni party ke ummidavaaron kii jeet tay kar izzat bachaai, phir vidhansabha up chunaavon main siton kaa talmail kiya or baad main vahi formula apana kar vidhansabha ke honevaale chunaavon ke liye siton kaa talmail bhi kar daalaa
 It is different that in this politics of revenge, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is now angry with Nitish's close proximity to Congress Party and especially Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 mulaayam kii naaraazgi kitni mahangi padegi, lekin ha chunavon ke purv unhone rang main bhaang daalane kaa kaam jarur karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The comments nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se badla lene ke liye ek se ek kai aise faisle liye hai, jo shaayad aam dinon main vah khud uske bade aalochak hote
 He first showed his party's Bahubali MLA Anant Singh the way to jail
 ye tark diya ja rahaa he ki anant singh apane kaarnon se jail gaye lekin sab jaanate hai ki anant singh agar ek yadav jati ke bachche kii hatya main aaropee na hote or na hi lalu yadav use pratishtha kaa prashn banaaya hota to patna police ne anant singh ke khilaaf ye karwaai nahin kii hoti
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar's government included many castes like Teli among the most backward castes, while many castes like the dominant backward castes like Mallah accepted the demand for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes
 iske alaava contract par kaam karne vaale shikshakon ko vetanman dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Accepting the demand of increasing the salary of every section who has been appointed on the contract, it shows how serious Nitish is towards his revenge politics
 darasal nitish ke mahagathbandhan ko maaloom he ki is chunaav main har ek vot mahatvurna he
 It is also considered a part of Nitish's politics to accept the demand of most women voters to implement the policy of prohibition of alcohol for years
 lekin jahaan narendra modi se badla lene kii aguwai bhale nitish kar rahe hon, lekin nitish se badla lene ke liye wo chaahe purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi hon yaa ramvilas paswan yaa upendra kushvaha, sabhi agar aaj narendra modi or bijepi ke ishaare par chal rahe hai to unka ek hi lakshya he ki kisi bhi tarah nitish kumaar se badla liya jaye

 lekin jahaan narendra modi se badla lene kii aguwai bhale nitish kar rahe hon, lekin nitish se badla lene ke liye wo chaahe purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi hon yaa ramvilas paswan yaa upendra kushvaha, sabhi agar aaj narendra modi or bijepi ke ishaare par chal rahe hai to unka ek hi lakshya he ki kisi bhi tarah nitish kumaar se badla liya jaye
 And for this, there cannot be a better captain than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, nor is there a better party than BJP in every respect
 lekin nitish ke peeche khadey lalu yadav or congress sab jaanate hai ki aaj kii raajnneeti main or vah bhi bihar ke akhaade main nitish kumaar se behatar modi se badla lene ke liye unki team kaa cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 The question is simple, but perhaps even after his victory and sitting on the Prime Minister's chair, Narendra Modi has not forgotten that he has got three elections in Bihar - November 2005 assembly elections, 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 2010 assembly elections
 Kept away from campaigning
 or in teenon chunavon main nitish ke netritv main siton kii sankhya badi
 It is different that even when votes were sought in Modi's name in last year's Lok Sabha elections, his coalition got the most seats in Bihar
 lekin modi maatr isse santusht hone vaale netaaon main se nahin or vidhansabha chunaavon main wo ek baar phir sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki agar bihar kii janata bahumat kaa aankada rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan (endie) kii jholii main de rahi thi tab usamen nitish ek mukhauta maatr the
 And even if no local leader is projected, as is happening in this time's election, Narendra Modi can still get the majority figure in Bihar
 or shaayad modi usase bhi zyada ek vigyaapan ke kaaran unke bina bhoj main aamantran kii shart ko bhi bhul nahin paa rahe hai yaa nitish kumaar ne gujarat sarkaar ke 5 karod kii kosi sahaayta kii raashi lautaai
 These are the three reasons why Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to miss the opportunity to take revenge on Nitish Kumar once again
 pradhanmantri modi badla lene ke liye kitna gambhir hai, iske liye aap dekh sakate hai ki pichley ek maheene main unhone har wo kadam uthaae hai jinhen karne ke liye unke upar maheenon se yaa maang kii ja rahi thi yaa dabaab daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Be it the decision to withdraw the land acquisition bill, or the matter of pending One Rank One Pension for ex-servicemen, or the chance to visit mosques in Arab countries, or announce a package of more than 1 lakh crores for Bihar
 Ho
 sabake peeche ek hi tark diya gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bihar ke chunaavon main pratishtha daanv par lagi he isliye vah nahin chaahate ki nitish kii aguwai vaale gathbandhan ko koi laabh mili
 In fact, he does not want to avoid any spices to win in his revenge script and if Prime Minister Modi said something wrong in Nitish's DNA in Muzaffarpur, or there is electricity in Bihar despite the improved state of electricity, the communication of electricity came All of this shows their vain revenge
 ab baat nitish kumaar kii
 Not only is he resigned from getting just 2 seats in the Lok Sabha elections last year, and he feels that if he wins the assembly elections, then he can be accounted for by Narendra Modi
 shuddh shabdon main kahen to badla liya ja saktaa he
 After the results of Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Nitish had believed that staying or appearing with Modi in this country can only give adverse results especially in Bihar's political scenario
 unki is dharna ko 2005 november, 2009 loksabhaa parinaam or 2010 ke vidhansabha ke nateezon se or bal mila
 And on this basis and on the advice of some top BJP leaders, he has bypassed the BJP on the issue of Narendra Modi, but he made a mistake, not believing his pro-voters about his campaign against Modi
 Was able to take
 khaskar jis muslim or ati pichhadaa samudaay ke samarthan kii ummid par unhone bijepi se naata todaa, usne unhen vidhansabha chunaavon tak intjaar kaa vaada kar loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 But Nitish also has to take revenge, so Nitish is adopting the policy of being an enemy of the enemy
 pehle lalu yadav se apane sambandhon main samvadaheenata khatm kii or samarthan lekar rajyasabha chunaavon main apni party ke ummidavaaron kii jeet tay kar izzat bachaai, phir vidhansabha up chunaavon main siton kaa talmail kiya or baad main vahi formula apana kar vidhansabha ke honevaale chunaavon ke liye siton kaa talmail bhi kar daalaa
 It is different that in this politics of revenge, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is now angry with Nitish's close proximity to Congress Party and especially Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 mulaayam kii naaraazgi kitni mahangi padegi, lekin ha chunavon ke purv unhone rang main bhaang daalane kaa kaam jarur karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The comments nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se badla lene ke liye ek se ek kai aise faisle liye hai, jo shaayad aam dinon main vah khud uske bade aalochak hote
 He first showed his party's Bahubali MLA Anant Singh the way to jail
 ye tark diya ja rahaa he ki anant singh apane kaarnon se jail gaye lekin sab jaanate hai ki anant singh agar ek yadav jati ke bachche kii hatya main aaropee na hote or na hi lalu yadav use pratishtha kaa prashn banaaya hota to patna police ne anant singh ke khilaaf ye karwaai nahin kii hoti
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar's government included many castes like Teli among the most backward castes, while many castes like the dominant backward castes like Mallah accepted the demand for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes
 iske alaava contract par kaam karne vaale shikshakon ko vetanman dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Accepting the demand of increasing the salary of every section who has been appointed on the contract, it shows how serious Nitish is towards his revenge politics
 darasal nitish ke mahagathbandhan ko maaloom he ki is chunaav main har ek vot mahatvurna he
 It is also considered a part of Nitish's politics to accept the demand of most women voters to implement the policy of prohibition of alcohol for years
 lekin jahaan narendra modi se badla lene kii aguwai bhale nitish kar rahe hon, lekin nitish se badla lene ke liye wo chaahe purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi hon yaa ramvilas paswan yaa upendra kushvaha, sabhi agar aaj narendra modi or bijepi ke ishaare par chal rahe hai to unka ek hi lakshya he ki kisi bhi tarah nitish kumaar se badla liya jaye
 And for this, there cannot be a better captain than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, nor is there a better party than BJP in every respect
 lekin nitish ke peeche khadey lalu yadav or congress sab jaanate hai ki aaj kii raajnneeti main or vah bhi bihar ke akhaade main nitish kumaar se behatar modi se badla lene ke liye unki team kaa cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 But Modi is not just one of the leaders to be satisfied with this and in the assembly elections he wants to prove once again that if the people of Bihar were giving majority figures to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), then Nitish was just a mask
 
 or agar kisi sthaneey netaa ko project nahin bhi kiya jaae, jaisaa is baar ke chunaav main ab tak ho rahaa he, tab bhi bihar main narendra modi bahumat kaa aankada dilaa sakate hai
 And perhaps Modi is unable to forget the condition of inviting him to the banquet because of an advertisement even more than that or Nitish Kumar returned Kosi assistance of 5 crores of Gujarat government
 ye teen aise kaaran hai, jiske chalate pradhanmantri narendra modi nitish kumaar se ek baar phir badla lene kaa mauka nahin chuknaa chaahate
 For how serious Prime Minister Modi is to take revenge, you can see that in the last one month, he has taken every step which he was being demanded or pressurized for months
 wo chaahe bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko waapas lene kaa nirnay ho, yaa purv sainikon ke liye lambit van rank van pension kaa maamla, yaa arab desho kii yatra main masjid jane kaa mauka, yaa phir bihar ke liye 1 lakh karod se adhik ke package kii ghoshnaa ho
 The reasoning behind all this is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reputation is at stake in Bihar elections, so he does not want the Nitish-led coalition to get any benefit
 darasal wo apane badale kii script main jeet ke liye kisi bhi masaale se parhez nahin karnaa chaahate or agar pradhanmantri modi ne mujffarpur main nitish ke diene main khot bataaya, yaa bihar main bijli kii sudhari haalat ke baavjood logon se bijli he, bijli ai kaa samvaad ye sab kahin na kahin unki badla lene kii betaabi ko darshata he
 Now Nitish Kumar talks
 vah naa keval pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main maatr 2 siten milane se khaar khaae baithe hai, or unhen lag rahaa he ki agar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet mil jaae to narendra modi se hisaab baraabar kiya ja saktaa he
 In pure words, it can be changed
 nitish 2004 main loksabhaa chunavon ke parinaam aane ke baad se ye maan baithe the ki is desh main modi ke saath rahanaa yaa dikhnaa khaskar bihar ke rajantik paridrishy par pratikul parinaam hi de saktaa he
 His belief was further strengthened by the 2005 November 2009 Lok Sabha results and the 2010 Assembly results
 or isi aadhaar par or bijepi ke kuch sheersh netaaon kii salaah par unhone narendra modi ke mudde par bijepi ko by-by to kar hi daalaa, lekin unhone ek chook kii, modi ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan ke bare main apane samarthak votaron ko vishwaas main nahin le paae
 Especially the Muslim and extremely backward community on which he broke away from the BJP in the hope of support, he promised him to wait till the assembly elections and supported the RJD and BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin badla nitish ko bhi lenaa he, isliye nitish dushman kaa dushman dost hota he vaali niti apana rahe hai
 First ended the lack of communication in his relations with Lalu Yadav and secured the honor of deciding the victory of his party candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections, then coordinated the seats in the assembly by-elections and later adopted the same formula for the seats for the assembly elections
 It also coordinated
 ye baat alag he ki badale kii is raajnneeti main nitish ke congress party or khaskar sonia gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se najdiki se samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab naaraaz hai
 Mulayam's displeasure will be very expensive, but before Ha Chunav, he has definitely done the work of adding hemp to the color
 tippaniyan Nitish has taken many decisions one by one to take revenge on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he himself would have been a big critic of in the ordinary days
 sabase pehle unhone apane party ke bahubali vidhayak anant singh ko jail kaa rasta dikhaaya
 It is being argued that Anant Singh went to jail for his own reasons, but everyone knows that if Anant Singh was not an accused in the murder of a Yadav caste child nor did Lalu Yadav make him a question of prestige, then Patna Police It would not have been taken against iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana
 Also announced a pay scale for the teachers working on the contract
 har vah tabaka jisaki niyukti anubandh par hui he, unke vetan badhaane kii maang ko maananaa ye dikhaata he ki nitish apane badale kii raajnneeti ke prati kitna gambheer hai
 Actually, Nitish's grand alliance knows that every single vote is important in this election
 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But where Nitish may be leading the revenge of Narendra Modi, but whether he is former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are going to be at the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP today
 His only goal is to somehow get revenge on Nitish Kumar
 or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se badhiya captain nahin ho saktaa or na hi bijepi se acchhee koi har maamle main suvidha sampann party
 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 pradhanmantri modi badla lene ke liye kitna gambhir hai, iske liye aap dekh sakate hai ki pichley ek maheene main unhone har wo kadam uthaae hai jinhen karne ke liye unke upar maheenon se yaa maang kii ja rahi thi yaa dabaab daalaa ja rahaa tha

 Recently, during the assembly elections held in five states, Sonia Gandhi held only one rally, that too in Telangana
 unhone madhyapradesh,rajasthan or chhattisgarh main ek bhi raily nahin kii thi
 Since then it was reported in political circles that Sonia will not contest the Lok Sabha elections this time and Priyanka will go to Rae Bareli instead
 jab priyanka ko congress kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya or purvi uttar pradesh kaa jimmaa diya gaya tab in khabaron ko or bal mila
 Then, even during Priyanka's three-day stay in Lucknow, workers from Prayagraj, Phulpur and Rae Bareli requested her to contest the Lok Sabha elections from these places

 The people of Rae Bareli are familiar with Priyanka as she has been campaigning for Sonia Gandhi
 raibareli kaa jimmaa bhi unheen ke paas rahata tha
 The people of Rae Bareli used to meet Priyanka only when she came to Delhi
 magar ab congress sutron ne saaf kar diya he ki priyanka is baar chunaav nahin ladengi or keval purvi uttar pradesh par focus karengi
 Sonia Gandhi is an MP from Rae Bareli since 2004
 iske pehle sonia amethi se chunaav jitati rahi hai

 a new controversy has arisen following Rahul Gandhi's statement on the Rafale deal during a no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha
 sansad main rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya ki france ke raashtrapati emanuel maikron ne unhen ek mulaakaat ke dauraan bataaya ki rafel deal main kisi tarah kii gopneeyata kaa praavdhaan nahin he or rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman ne piem ke kehane par sansad main jhooth bolaa he
 In his reply, Nirmala Sitharaman accused Rahul of misrepresenting and misleading the House
 vahiin france ke raashtrapati kii taraf se safai di gai he ki rafel deal ke tathyon ko ujagar na kiye jane kaa samjhauta donon deshon ke bich he
 Despite this cleanliness of France, Rahul Gandhi stands by his statement
 sansad main rahul gandhi kaa bayaanrahul gandhi kaa aarope ki unhen france ke raashtrapati ne bataaya tha ki donon deshon ke bich hue rafel samjhaute main kisi tarah kii gopneeyata kaa koi pratibandh nahin he
 Speaking on the Rafale Deal during the no-confidence motion in Parliament, the Congress President alleged that the country's Defense Minister did not fulfill the promise to disclose on the expenditure in the Rafale Deal
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki desh kii raksha mantri sansad main baithi hai
 She had said that she would give full details of the money spent in purchasing the jet
 lekin baad main kahati hai ki vah kharch kaa khulaasa nahin kar saktin kyonki bharat sarkaar kaa france kii sarkaar ke saath gopneeyata kaa samjhauta hua he
 Rahul Gandhi claimed that in his meeting with the President of France, the President denied any such deal
 rahul ne ye bhi kaha ki piem ke kehane par rakshaamantri ne sadan main rafel ke bare main ye jhooth bolaa
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified on Rahul's charge, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while clarifying on the Rafael Deal from France, said that he did not have any details of the conversation between Rahul Gandhi and the President of France
 nirmala ne ‘india today’ (sansad main raksha mantri ne media house kaa naam nahin liya) ko die gaye ek intervyuu kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki france ke raashtrapati ne bhartiya media se kaha ki commercial agreement ke chalate bharat sarkaar is deal se judi soochna ko saarvajanik nahin kar sakati he
 Read this: Jaitley said on Rafael, go before Pranab to meet the question, meet Rahul Pranab's clarification 'the security agreement between India and France in 2008 provides that the two countries will not make public any information that the arms related to defense deal Or impact on the safety and efficiency of the equipment ', so it is natural on the basis that on 23 September 2016, 36 Rafale jets and its parts between the two countries This 2008 agreement will be applicable in the deal to buy ों
 france ke raashtrapati ne saarvajanik taur par 9 march ko india today ko die apane intervyuu main saaf-saaf kaha tha ki donon deshon ke bich samjhauta behad samvedansheel he or isse judi ahm jaankaree kaa khulaasa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Rahul Gandhi's answer to the cleanliness of France After the French government issued a clarification, Rahul Gandhi said that even now the French government is denying this, it is their wish
 rahul ne daawey ko doharaaya ki france ke raashtrapati ne unase yah baat kahi thi
 Rahul said that Congress leader Anand Sharma and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were also present with him when the French President said this
 india today se 8 march ko intervyuu main maikron ne kya kaha thabharat or france ke bich hui rafel deal par france ke raashtrapati emanuel maikron ne kaha he ki yadi bharat is mudde par vipaksh ke saath kisi tarah kii bahes ke liye deal kii kuch baarikiyon se pardaa uthaanaa chahta he to france sarkaar virodh nahin karegi
 In an interview to India Today, Macron said that economic, industrial and strategic interests have been taken care of in this deal
 ise padhein: france kii hari jhandi, modi sarkaar chaahe to khulkar kare rafel deal par vipaksh se bahasahaalanki, maikron ne kaha ki yah deal unke kaarykaal main nahin kii gai he lekin unka maananaa he ki is deal se donon deshon ko phayda hua he
 On the secrecy of the deal, Macron said that it is not appropriate to make disclosures when there is a very sensitive business interest between the two countries
 maikron ne kaha ki is deal main commercial agreement ke tahat pratiyogi companiyon ko deal kii baarikiyon kii jaankaree nahin honi chahie
 This commercial agreement is related to the interests of some companies, so privacy is justified
 rajyasabha main mangalvaar ko kaarywahi shuru hote hi vipaksh ne sadhvi niranjan jyoti or giriraaj singh ke vivaadit bayaan par hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 Amid the commotion and sloganeering, the Congress demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be brought to the House and clarified himself in the matter, while the team leader and former TV personalityderek o Brianne sarcastically said that the PM should be given a visa to appear in the Rajya Sabha 
 congress kii ore se anand sharma ne pradhanmantri ko bulaae jane kii maang karte hue kaha ki vah ek baar bhi rajyasabha nahin aae hai
 In such a case, at least in the case of such disputed statements, they should come and express their views
 sharma ne kaha, 'mujhe to yahaan tak chintaa ho rahi he ki aakhir pradhanmantri hai kahaan?'duusari ore, tiemasi netaa derek o bryan ne piem ke videsh dauron par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki unki samaj se piem modi ko rajyasabha main bulaane ke liye vija diya janaa chahie
 However, this is not the first time Derek is making such rhetoric
 vah isse pehle bhi ek sabha ke dauraan piem ko kasaai bataa chuke hai, jis par khub bavaal hua tha

 Significantly, Modi had said nothing against Shiv Sena, a former ally of the BJP, in an election rally in Maharashtra, paying tribute to the late Bal Thackeray
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main likhaa he, modi kehete hai ki vah apane bhaashanon main shivasena ke khilaaf kuch nahin kahenge kyonki vah bala sahib thakare kaa sammaan karte hai
 We also respect the Prime Minister

 It further states, what would you say to keep an eye on the state exchequer and (for the benefit of Gujarat) deal for the sake of Mumbai? Is it not to rob Maharashtra? After this, talking about the blessings of Shivaji Maharaj is nothing but pretense

 It is politics that we need to improve— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) October 22, 2015 Rijiju said during his speech at the inauguration ceremony of a think tank on police related subjects, 'I witness a few years old statement of a Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 i am unhone kaha tha ki uttar bharat ke logon ko niyam todane main majaa aata he lekin shaam tak unhen maafee maangane ko majaboor hona padaa tha
 "tejendra Khanna gave the statement in 2008," the Union Minister said, "but i think what he said was right
" ’ rigiju ne haalanki uparajyapal kaa naam nahin liya lekin document bataate hai ki dilli ke tatkaaleen uparajyapal tejendra khanna ne farvari 2008 main tippanee kii thi, ‘yah uttar or pashchim bharat kii visheshta he ki logon ko kanoon kaa ulanghan karne or yah shekhi maarane mensamman or garv kaa ehsashota he ki iske liye unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui
 However, he withdrew his statement after opposition from Congress and BJP
 rigiju ne kaha ki yahaan logon ko yah shekhi baghaarne main majaa aata he ki unhone ek police adhikari ko dhamkaaya
 He also said that it is not right to hold the police responsible for everything
 'police ko danda chalaanaa hi padegaa'rigiju ne kaha, ‘kai log kehete hai ki police bahut ashisht ho gai he
 The police will only be rude if the citizens are undisciplined
 agar log anushaasit honge, to police ashisht nahin hogi
 But it is generally said that people do not listen unless you beat them with sticks
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yahaan to bolte hai ki danda jab tak nahin degaa tolog sudharte nahinhain
 But if people are not well, are undisciplined, do not believe after speaking ten times, then they will have to run the stick
 ’'pehle khud sudharen phir dilli police par aarope lagaaein
 
 
 'he takes pride in breaking the rules and enjoys doing so
 The minister's comments have come at a time when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has alleged that the Delhi Police is' most corrupt'
 unhone kaha, ‘kejariwal kehete rahete hai ki dilli police ye nahin karti, wo nahin karti, lekin agar vah khud nahin sudharenge to police kya karegi
 Defending the police, he said that it is easy to hold the police responsible for any incident or crime anywhere, but only those with khaki uniforms wake up overnight and ensure peace and law and order
 rigiju ne kaha, ‘police ko gaali dekar samaaj nahin sudharega
 An incident cannot corrupt the police force
 ’ unhone kaha ki mahilaon ke utpedan ke bare main media main baar baar khabaren aana mantri ke rup main bahut ‘pareshaan karne vaala’ or ‘hataash karne vaala’ he

 china ne tibeti dharmaguru dalai lamas ko lekar bharat samet duniya bhar ko dhamkee di he
 China warned leaders and governments around the world that meeting Tibetan religious leader the Dalai Lama would be considered a serious crime
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab china ne dalai lamas ko lekar kadaa virodh jataayaa he, wo isse pehle bhi kai baar apni gidad bhabhaki dikhaa chukaa he
 China has always accused the Dalai Lama of trying to separate Tibet from it
 china kaa kahana he ki usase kootnithik sambandh bane ke liye videshi sarkaron ko tibet ko china kaa hissaa maananaa hoga
 Zhang Yijiang, executive vice-president of the United Front Work Department of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), said that accepting invitation from any country or any organization to meet the Kadalai Lamas was a serious affront to the sentiments of the Chinese people
 Will be a crime aisa karnaa china sarkaar ko vaid maanane kii patibaddhta kaa ulanghan bhi mana jayega
 Zhang said China would not accept any argument from other countries and leaders to meet the 82-year-old Dalai Lama as a religious leader
 unhone kaha, 'main yah saaf karnaa chahta hum ki 14wein dalai lamas dharm kii aad main ek raajnneetik hasti hai
 Without naming India, he said that the Dalai Lama, after betraying his motherland, fled to another country (india) and established his so-called government in exile
 darasal, saal 1959 sedalai lamabharat main nirvaasan main rah rahe hai or himachal ke dharmashala main nirvasit tibet sarkaar bhi he
 China was also strongly opposed to allowing the Dalai Lama to visit several parts of the north-east including India's Arunachal Pradesh this year
 haalanki bharat ne china ke virodh kii tanik bhi parvaah nahin kii
 Not only this, China has been putting pressure on India for a long time regarding the Dalai Lama

 vahaan kii galiyaan kaaphi sankari hai
 The factory which was on fire was running illegally in the residential area
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki puraa ilaaka avaidh or choti factriyon se bharaa hua he
 Which neither got NOC nor were any fire extinguishers made
 is sankare ilaake main chaaron ore bijli ke taar hai
 The Chief Fire Officer, who reached the spot, said that when he was informed about the fire, it was only told that a building was on fire
 ghatana ke baad ab tak 50 se adhik logon ko vahaan se nikaala ja chukaa he or unhen chaar alag -alag aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya

 ek acha upanyaaskaar har baar nayaa tilism rachataa he or pathakon ko ek nai duniya main le jaataa he or rahasyon par se parade uthaata he
 One such mysterious and exciting world is unveiled by Bhagwandas Morwal in his new novel work, Hell Messiah
 narak maseehaa main kathakaar saamaajik andolanon kii chhadam duniya hamaare saamne pesh karte hue unke kirdaaron or krityon se hamaara parichay karaata he
 The world is littered with unheard and untold stories of ngos in which the abusive revelations of evil mindset and dark tendencies of childishness are unveiled in the sanctum sanctorum of so-called social movements
 kisi bhi ghar kaa sach uske osaare main chipa hota he, dalan to bas pradarshan kaa rangamanch hota he
 The world is able to see the demonstrative deception of social movements; People remain unaware of the activities happening in the porch
 is upanyaas par ‘aap’ ke rajnatik udai or usase judi rajnatik aakankshaon or apekshaaon kaa bhi spasht prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Most of the people associated with AAP have an association with ngos in some form and through that they also made their presence in the public and were able to influence them to a great extent

 There are many stories in this novel
 kai kahaniyaan apane aap main purna lagati hai—jaise maratha ekka kii kahani
 This story has been told by keeping the ngo's involvement in body trade in which the characters like Sarla Bajaj, Kabir, Sania Patel, Sister Bhagyavati, Vandana Rao are injuring the whole society with their bloody claws
 ye hameshaa shikaar kii khoj main rahete hai or jahaan dhandhe kaa koi sutara najar aata he use lapakkar dharne kaa jugad bithaane lagate hai
 It sees two characters surrounded and defeated by a dilemma — Gangadhar Acharya, who is clutching the robed Gandhi's diapers and watching the spectacle of Gandhi's plunder
 duusare ‘prachand’ jo dhwast hote takhat par baithe aise chuke hue communist netaa hai jo samaajwaad kii durgati dekh bisur rahe hai
 His supreme disciple Kabir, who once sang songs of waving the Red Paracham at the Red Fort, has become a pseudo Gandhian and a complete puppet in the hands of capitalist businesses and imperialists
 morwal ne in paatro ke madhyam se gandhivadi mulya or macrsvaadi chintan or andolan kii adhogati kaa chitra ukera he
 Anger resistance results in sarcasm when it reaches its peak
 puure upanyaas main vyangy kii antardhara he jisamen kathakaar kaa pratirodh or krodh charam par he
 The language of Morwal makes it even more vibrant
 kai baar ghatnaayen punrariti kaa bhi ehsaas karaati hai
 Morwal is a folk color storyteller and wherever the language of Mewat and the language has come in it, he gets in his way
 katha raseeli ho jaati he
 The new theme, new vision and new light gives this novel a new tone

 uttar pradesh ke unnav ke bangaramau se bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger par laga balaatkaar kaa aarope or peedita ke pita kii jail main sandigdh halaat main hui maut se yogi sarkaar par sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 Opposition including SP, BSP and Congress have started besieging the government of the state on this issue
 sarkaar ke saath-saath party ke liye bhi senger se judaa ye vivaad mushkilen badhaane vaala he
 Questions are arising whether Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will take any such strict step to save his government and party's image as former UP Chief Minister Mayawati took during his tenure
 yogi sarkaar encounter ke jariye krime control karne main jamkar vaahvahee lut rahi he lekin rasukhadaaron ke dwaara kiye gaye krime par uskaa ravaiya abhi tak ulta hi he
 The government is engaged in the exercise to withdraw cases in cases like riots on all the influential people
 anusuchit jati ayog ke adhyaksh or agra se bijepi saansad ramshankar katheria par lage 13 cese bhi waapas liye ja rahe hai
 Apart from this, there is also a readiness to withdraw the case of rape against Swami Chinmayanand, who was a minister in the Vajpayee government
 haalanki kuldeep singh senger ke maamle main unke bhai ko giraftaar kiya gaya he lekin use bhi peedita ke pita se marpet ke maamle main uthaaya gaya he jabaki peedita vidhayak or unke bhai par gangrape kaa aarope laga rahi he
 Meanwhile, Independent MLA Amanmani is also accused of taking possession of the land but the complainant who came to meet Yogi was scolded and banished
 mayawati ne apane awaas se karaayaa tha giraftaarbata den ki 2007 main basapa kii sarkaar bane kuch hi din gujarey the
 The then BSP MP Umakant Yadav was accused of land possession
 mayawati ne saansad ko bulaayaa or apane hi awaas se police ke hawaale kar diya
 Everyone was surprised by Mayawati's move and it also sent a strong message to the police and the administration that no softening would be done with the influential people even if they are associated with the ruling party
 sirf umakant yadav hi nahin, mayawati ne apane shasankaal main banda jile se basapa ke tatkaaleen vidhayak purushottam naresh dvivedi ko balaatkaar ke maamle main giraftaar karwaakar jail bheja tha
 Like BJP MLA Sengar, Dwivedi was accused of rape by a girl from Banda
 is maamle ko baad main sibiai ko saunp diya gaya tha
 Similarly, Anand Sen Yadav, MLA from Faizabad, was a minister in Mayawati's government
 unpar bhi ek ladki ke apharan or hatya kaa aarope laga
 The BSP supremo dismissed Anand Sen from the cabinet and sent him to jail
 haalanki baad main court se anand sen bari kar die gaye
 During the BSP government itself, several mlas, including Bhagwan Sharma alias Guddu Pandit, Yogendra Sagar, Awadh Pal Singh Yadav, were severely accused of molestation and rape
 basapa sarkaar main mantri rahe daddu prasad par bhi ek mahila ne gambhir aarope lagaae the
 All of them were expelled from the party or left the party themselves
 gayatri prajapati se akhilesh sarkaar kii fajihankhilesh yadav ke netritv vaali sapa sarkaar main mantri rahe gayatri prajapati par bhi banda kii ek mahila ne balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 However, Akhilesh could not show the strictness like Mayawati
 peedit mahila ne court kii sharan lee or adaalat ke hastkshep ke baad gayatri prajapati ke khilaaf shikanja ksaa lekin iske baavjood gayatri prajapati ko yogi sarkaar aane ke baad hi giraftaar kiya ja sakaa
 He openly shared the stage with Akhilesh Yadav
 akhilesh sarkaar banane ke ek saal ke baad 2013 main sapa ke tatkaaleen vidhayak mahendra singh urf jhin babu goa main baar dancer ke saath giraftaar hue the
 After the opposition raised questions, the SP showed them the way out
 iske alaava sapa ke vidhayak rahe amanmani par bhi patni kii hatya ke maamle ne party kii jamkar kirakiri karai thi
 Manoj Paras, MLA from Nagina region of Bijnor in SP government, is also in the list of similar accused who had to lose their ministerial post

 As a media worker, for the past several years, i have been a frequent spectator of this 'incident'
 haa
 
 
 Before this annual event, a separate presentation of the Rail Budget, which has a nine per cent share in the economy, is also done in the form of 'rehearsal' on the floor of the Parliament
 agar rail bajet ko aam bajet kaa 'trailor' kaha jaae to koi atishyokti nahin hogi
 For the last few years, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know whether it is an economic event or a political one
 
 
 
 To continue the process of development in the country, a legislation has been enacted to present the blueprint of the Five Year Plan
 aam bajet main sarkaar ke kharche or aamadani kaa hisaab-kitaab rakhana hota he lekin netaaon ne ise tex main chhot yaa badhotaree karne kaa salanaa 'utsav' bana diya he
 The Minister of Railways and Finance leads the Parliament in a 'new suit'
 pichley kai anubhavon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki bajet main kiye gaye praavdhaanon se zyada phayda bade udyogpatiyon yaa kahen ki amiron ko hi hota he
 The lower and middle classes see their expenses increasing more or less
 is baar haalanki ek karod se zyada aay vaale logon par 10 fisadi kaa atirikt prabhaar lagaaya gaya he lekin beete kai saalon main mujhe yaad nahin aata ki aisa koi praavdhaan aayaa ho
 Chidambaram deserves congratulations for this
 haalanki, iske peeche maujuuda sarkaar kaa aakhri bajet or desh ke kai hisson se uthi aisi maang zyada rahi
 Otherwise, Tata, Birla and Ambani were also paying taxes at the rate of 30 per cent
 har baar tatkaaleen sarkaar apane dal or kshetra se jude logon kaa hi phayda karaati najar ai he
 In a way, it has now been accepted publicly
 netaa yah tark bhi dete dikhne lage hai ki agar rail mantri or vitt mantri apane kshetra main vishesh yojanaon ko le jate hai to kya buraai he
 
 
 ? Comments nae tarah ke kar praavdhaanon ke baad 'nikal' jane ke raste bhi saath hi saath suza die jate hai
 The upper class has full resources to benefit from these provisions
 
 
 agar koi pisataa he to vah he nimna or madhyam varg
 The break of this economic-political alliance is not visible to the common people at present
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya vaaki is tarah ke salanaa bajaton ko pesh karne kii koi jarurat he
 
 
 Should it not be included in the plan of the Five Year Plan itself and the budget should not be presented as a balance sheet
 
 
 jisase netaaon ko sasti raajnneeti main padane kaa ek or mauka na mili
 or
 
 
 agar bajet pesh karnaa itnaa hi jaruri he to kyon na har vibhaag yaa sector kaa alag-alag bajet pesh kiya jaae or har netaa ko 'nayaa suut' pahanane kaa mauka diya jaae
 
 
 
 pichley kuch saalon se to yah bhi pataa karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he ki yah ek aarthik aayojan he yaa raajnneetik
 
 
 
 desh main vikaas kii prakriya ko jari rakhane ke liye panchavarshiya yojana kaa khaakaa pesh karne kaa vidhaan banaaya gaya he
 The expenditure and income of the government has to be kept in the general budget, but the leaders have made it an annual 'celebration' of tax exemption or increase
 'nayaa suut' pahanakar sansad main rail or vitt mantri iske aguva banate hai
 On the basis of many previous experiences, it can be said that the big industrialists or say the rich benefit more than the provisions made in the budget
 nichle or madhyam varg ko kamobesh apana kharchaa badhata hua hi najar aata he
 This time though an additional charge of 10 per cent has been imposed on people with income above one crore, but in the last several years i do not remember that such a provision has come
 iske liye chidambaram badhai ke paatr hai
 However, behind this, the last budget of the current government and such demand arose from many parts of the country
 anyathaa tata, birla or ambani bhi 30 fisadi kii dar par hi kar chukaa rahe the
 Every time the erstwhile government is seen benefiting only its own party and people associated with the region
 balki ek tarah se ab ise saarvajanik rup se sweekaar bhi kar liya gaya he
 Leaders are also beginning to argue that what is wrong if the railway minister and finance minister take special schemes in their area
 
 
 ?tippaniyan Following new types of tax provisions, along with 'exit' are also suggested
 ucch varg ke paas puure sansaadhan hote hai in praavdhaanon se phayda uthaane ke
 
 
 If someone grinds it is the lower and middle class
 is aarthik-raajnneetik gathjod kaa tod philhal aam jan ke paas najar nahin aata
 Now the question is whether there is any need to present such annual budgets
 
 
 kya panchavarshiya yojana ke khaake main hi ise samahit nahin kar diya janaa chahie or bajet ko ek balance shit ke rup main hi pesh nahin kar diya janaa chahie
 
 
 So that leaders do not get another chance to get into cheap politics
 yaa
 
 
 If presenting the budget is so important, why not present a different budget for each department or sector and give every leader a chance to wear a 'new suit'
