 Shashi is a very good man
 ‚Äùaap shaayad nahin jaanateen, lekin ek saal pehle hi meraa rishta tay ho gaya tha
 The sisters pressured me to get married and i agreed as an idiot
 meraa rishta uttar pradesh ke nazibabad main kisi ke saath tay hua tha
 i don't want to name it because it won't be okay
 lekin vahaan par baat kuch ban nahin rahi thi or aakhirkaar maine vahaan shaadi na karne kaa faisla kiya
 When Shashi proposed marriage, some friends advised not to say yes in haste
 par maine to jindagi main hameshaa hi jokhim uthaae hai or main yah bhi jaanati thi ki shashi bhala aadmi he
 On July 26, 1974, we got married to Muslim customs in our home Sahil
 meraa betaa sohail 1975 main or beti kashvi 1976 main paidaa hue
 Shashi did not like the weather of Bombay
 nami se unhen bechaini hoti thi
 One year we went to Bangalore to celebrate our wedding anniversary and Shashi enjoyed the weather there
 bas, hamane faisla kar liya ki vahiin ek farm lekar bas jaaenge
 We opened a dairy, grew vegetables and sunflower flowers and started making sunflower oil
 farmahouse puri tarah bana nahin tha
 There were just two rooms to live

 i remember that children used to do homework in a gas light back then
 lekin maine vahaan basane kii thaan lee thi or jab main kuch thaan leti hum to karke rahati hum
 i wanted my children to grow up in a natural environment
 ve phulon kii khubsuurati, falon, pedo or pashu-pakshiyon ke saath jeena seekhen
 Life on the farm was passing through great beauty and peace
 maine siikhaa ki ghar main paneer kaise banaate hai, apni jameen se subjiyan toduya or khaanaa kitna acha lagata he
 We lived on that farm for 16 years

 The bouquet of fresh flowers in any office obviously makes one feel happy, but these fresh flowers are the cause of controversy in the MCD these days
 darasal, emsidi main netaaon or senior afasaron ke daftaron ke liye rojaanaa taaje phool mangaaye jate hai
 But the expenditure on these has created a new controversy
 emsidi se mili aankadon ke mutabik south or north emsidi main april 2013 se lekar disambar 2013 tak phulon or guladaston se sajaavat par lakhon rupye phoonk die hai jise lekar vipaksh ne nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Leader of the Opposition in North MCD, Mukesh Goyal, is alleging that when the MCD has its own nursery and gardener, why is it being used to bring flowers from outside
 emsidi se mili aankadon ke mutabik south emsidi main salbhar main 30 lakh rupye se adhik kii raashi nagar nigam dakshini main sirf netaaon or afasaron kii teble par phool sajaane main hi kharch ho gai
 Similarly, in the last nine months, flowers worth more than 5 lakh 60 thousand rupees have been purchased in North MCD for decoration
 'aaj tak' ke paas us dastavej kii copy bhi he jiske mutabik north emsidi main har maheene phulon se sajaavat par 50 hajaar rupye se lekar 86 hajaar rupye tak phoonk die gaye
 On the other hand, the BJP ruling the corporation has refused to consider it as an issue
 south emsidi main sthai samiti adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ke mutabik jahaan phulon kii jarurat he, phool sirf vahiin lagavaaye jate hai kyonki netaaon or adhikariyon se milane kai log pahunchate hai
 In such a situation, it is important to take care of the beauty of the office as well
 gauratlab ki emsidi ke paas khud kii kai nursery or karmchaariyon kii baari bharkam fouj he magar adhikariyon or varisht netaaon kii teble par sajaane ke liye guladaste baahar se kharide jate hai or isi vajah se nigam par har saal lakhon rupee kaa boj pad rahaa he

 technology se kuch bhi imposible nahin
 Because now thieves are also using Google to steal (aadhar card to ATM)

 Currently, the Central Government is trying to formulate a new educational policy
 yah acchhee baat he, isse ajukeshan ek kadam aage badhegi
 But while doing this, it is important to keep in mind that the steps taken earlier for education, need to be built up
 isaki vajah yah he ki 11veen panchavarshiya yojana main 2006 se lekar 2011 tak ucch shiksha kii samasya kaa adhyayan kiya gaya tha
 It showed what are the problems in higher education
 unke upaay par bhi adhyayan hua or uske aadhaar par human plan kii niti banaai gai
 Therefore, out of the earlier policy which was formulated, a new policy should be formulated based on some of the things
 meri samaj main ucch shiksha kii jo samasyaayein hai, ve chaar tarah kii hai
 The first problem is that the rate of higher education means that the enrollment number is very low, which should be increased
 duusari samasya darja yani kii gunvattta kii he, jisko badhaayaa janaa chahie
 The third problem is the education treaty
 chauthi samasya upyogi shiksha yani railvent ajukeshan kii he, jisase ki chaatr-chatraayen aaj ke daur main rojgaar ke liye unmukh hon
 Our higher education rate is still up to 25, which is very important to bring it to 50-60
 iske liye maujuuda vishvavidhyalayon ko kshamta badhaani padegi or jahaan-jahaan jaruri he ki vahaan vishvavidhyalay or collejon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 It is mainly a matter of money
 sarkaar ko vishvavidhyalayon kii madad kerani he or collejon kii sankhya badhaani he
 As far as quality is concerned, it is decided by three things: one is the teacher, second is the infrastructure and third is the course of education and teaching method
 hamaare yahaan shikshakon ko lekar samasyaayein rahi hai
 There is a shortage of teachers here and to overcome this, we have to appoint a large number of teachers
 pichhali panchavarshiya yojana main shikshakon kaa vetan badhaayaa gaya tha
 This made the possibility of good people coming into this profession
 lekin iske liye zyada se zyada piechdi chaatr-chaatraon kii jarurat he or unki sankhya hamen badhaani hogi
 This requires increasing their economic security & in terms of both number and amount
 isse ucch shiksha main supplai badhati he
 It is just a matter of infrastructure that in educational institutions and other academic matters, they have to be increased further with the improvement of basic things
 paathyakram main jo shaikshanik sudhaar hai, credit or grading system, semester system aadi, ye sabhi to pehle hi shuru kiye ja chuke hai
 The present government is also insisting on this, so it should be done well
 isse shiksha kii gunvattta bad jaaegi
 The third issue is that everyone should have equal access to education
 abhi ucch shiksha main mahilaon, dalit, adivaasiyon, hindu or isai ke mukaable muslim chaatr-chaatraon kii sankhya kaaphi kam he
 Similarly, the representation of villages is less than in cities
 ucch shiksha main daakhile kii jo yah vishmata he, isko hamen dur karnaa hoga
 a policy should be made for this
 shiksha sabko milani chahie, sabko apni utpaadakta badhaane kaa adhikaar he
 So this is an important issue
 isi tarah upyogi shiksha ke maamle main skill ajukeshan badhaai jaani chahie
 The good thing is that the current central government has made a separate policy regarding skill development
 praasangik shiksha kaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki hamen aisi shiksha dene kii jarurat he jisase chaatr-chaatraon main naagarik pradutt adhikaron kii samaj badhaai ja sake
 The matter of the University of Hyderabad also seems to be related to this
 vishvavidhyalayon main vibhinn jati, samudaay, or dharm ke bachche padhgaye aate hai
 They come up with their old ideas and that creates a separation between them
 isaki vajah se unke bich vivaad hote hai
 There is also talk of equality, discrimination and due to reservation, there is no right feeling towards dalit-adivasi students
 so hamen unhen ek course banaakar unamem samanta or nyaay kii mul bhavanaaen, har kisi ke dharm evam samskruti ko aadar karne kii shiksha deni hogi
 One of the reasons for the recent controversy at the University of Hyderabad is the separation between students
 yah algaav jati, vichaar aadi ke aadhaar par hua kyonki unhen ham waisi shiksha de hi nahin paa rahe hai, jisase unamem samaan bhav paidaa ho
 In America, the course is made by studying courses on problems like inequality, poverty, caste, religion and gender
 is tarah ham campason main bhed or deevaaren khatm karne kii koshish kar sakate hai
 There is nothing like this in our higher education right now
 kabhi-kabhi maanav adhikaar vishay par jarur baat hoti rahati he par yah sahi tareeke se ham nahin de paa rahe hai
 In AIIMS, i was the chairman of the committee investigating similar caste discrimination, the committee also found administrative discrimination there and this discrimination happens mostly in educational institutions
 is tarah chaatr-chaatraon ke bich algaav dur karne vaali shiksha kii jarurat or bad jaati he
 (the author is the former chairman of UGC) uttar pradeshmen mujffarnagar jile main bhopa thana kshetra antargat karhera gaanv ke ek mandir main ek sant kii pratimaa apavitra kar diye jane ke kaaran ilaake main tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Police said the matter came to light when the people found the statue unholy and protested against the issue
 jila adhyaksh ravindar gautam sahit bispi kaaryakartaaon ne is silsile main doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karne kii maang kii
 As a precaution, additional police forces have been deployed in the area and security arrangements have been tightened

 Significantly, the GST collection in September was significantly reduced to Rs 91,916 crore
 lagaataar duusare maheene jiesti sangrah lakshya se kam rahaa he
 Earlier in August, the GST collection was Rs 98,202 crore
 kya he ashankalgataar jiesti sangrah lakshya se kam rahane kii vajah se vitt varsh (2019-20) main jiesti sangrah ummid se 40,000 karod rupee kam hone kii ashanka he
 In view of this, states have started raising concerns
 sutron ke mutabik, centre sarkaar ne haal hi main goa main hui jiesti council kii baithak main is bare main rajyon ke vitt mantriyon ko bataa diya he
 Expressing concern over this, states have asked to make up for it
 haal main jiesti council kii baithak vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke corporate tex main katautee ke baad hui thi
 The council had praised Nirmala Sitharaman's bold decision, but state finance ministers expressed concern over the revenue shortfall

 kal ko koi kuch bhi likhegaa to kya court se saboot maan legaa
 This will start a very bad trend
 court ne kaha ki ham kisi bhi lekhak ke vichaaron par nahin ja sakate
 We cannot go into all this now
 yah ek khatarnaak pravriti set karegaa, yadi log trial samaapt hone ke baad kitaaben likhnaa shuru karte hai or aisi chizon ke bare main baat karte hai
 If we start listening to all these arguments, there will be no end
 unhen mukademe ke samay khud ko aage laana chahie tha
 Now what can be the purpose of writing all this? How can we answer this? Justice Bhushan questioned the argument made by advocate AP Singh that he would only listen to the debate on the evidence of the case
 singh ne veda puraana, treta yug kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki kalyug main log keval 60 saal tak jite hai, jabaki duusare yug main kahin zyada
 Singh also cited the climate of Delhi
 singh ne kaha ki maut kii sajaa maanavadhikaron ke khilaaf he or bhartiya samskruti ke khilaaf he
 We are living in Delhi and air is like a gas chamber, why the death penalty? i am being sentenced to death because i am poor

 The life span of any average person is becoming less and less

 He cited the views of Mahatma Gandhi and Abdull Kalam
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya samskruti jio or jeene do main yakeen karti he
 He said that Bapu had said that while taking a decision, the poorest man should be taken care of, what will he gain? No one is going to benefit from the death penalty here
 faansee kii sajaa nyaay ke naam par sabase badi ninsaphi he
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued on behalf of Delhi Police
 unhone kaha ki yah maut kii sajaa ke liye feet cese he
 This is the rarest of rare case

 He should get the death penalty
 is maamle main jald faisla ho
 Convicted legal bets are taking time by playing punches
 mehta ne kaha ki punarvichaar yachika ko khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 AP Singh gave the example of Rajiv Gandhi and Beant Singh being sentenced to death by hanging
 singh ne nalini jaise kai maamalon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki in maut kii sajaa ke maamalon me faansee kii sajaa ko umr kaid me badla gaya he
 It is not right to be hanged
 jindagi ke kisi imtihaan main agar purush asafal ho jate hai or unki partner safal ho jaati he to mardon ke man main jeevanasathi ke prati jalan paidaa ho jaati he
 He is jealous of his female partner
 ek nai research se is baat kaa khulaasa hua he
 The study has also revealed that women do not have any effect on their male partner's success or failure
 uniwarsity of florida ke shodhakarta ket redliff ne 896 logon par paanch prayog kar ye nishkarsh nikaala he
 In this study published by the American Psychological Association, it was found that it does not matter whether a partner's achievement or failure was social or personal
 purushon ko tab or bhi bura lagata he jab unki mahila partner kisi aisi pariksha main paas ho gai hon jisamen vah fail hue hon

 The price was also talked about, but just before the purchase, DRDO offered to make it within two years at half the price

 When the indo-us relationship later improved, these radars could be purchased in 2003, but the price had already doubled

 In this case, when will you complete the rehabilitation work? On behalf of the petitioner, it was said that the mother Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should decide how many people can go for darshan? is

 court ne kaha ki ye sach he ki inhen raaton raat nahin hataaya ja saktaa, lekin yojanabaddh tareeke se shuruyaat to kerani hogi
 There is a need to bring a plan about this
 ise har saal das 10 fisadi kam kar ke shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 It was said on behalf of Vaishno Devi Shrine Board that it is not possible to remove the mules immediately
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki khachchar desh ke duusare hisson main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 On behalf of Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, it is said that in Manali, Shimla, Kedarnath, North East, mules are used in other places

 The Supreme Court said in its order that the High Court cannot award grace marks in this way
 yani supreme court ke is aadesh ke baad philhal rajya sarkaar kii 85 fisadi siton par hi OBC kota uplabdh rahegaa

 Under this, only SC / ST can be given reservation

 Whereas 15 percent seats in all the colleges are held by the Central Government under the central quota

 hyderabadase loksabhaa sadsy ne kaha ki unhen pataa nahin ki nai karadhaan pranali kis had tak sangathit rup se lagu kii ja sakegi
 Owaisi said that the government was hurrying over the GST bill
 asaduddin ovaisi kaa maananaa he ki isse araajaktaa hogi jaise notebandi ke samay hui thi kyonki sarkaar ne tab bhi koi uchit yojana nahin banaai theis baar bhi, sarkaar jaldbaaji kar rahi he
 Last year, on the midnight of November 8, PM Narendra Modi banned 500 and 1000 currency notes in the country, after which there was an atmosphere of chaos in the country overnight due to lack of money of people
 The notes had to be opened in 400 rupees
 log apni naukari par na jaakar bainko kii linon main jaakar kai- kai ghanton main paisa nikaalane main safal ho rahe the
 This is the reason why Owaisi feels that the same kind of situation does not happen again in the country

 109 children have died in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar
 yah aadhikarik aankada he
 The media has crossed the 130 mark
 jab tak ham puure bihar ke health system or bajet ko nahin samajhenge, bade sawaal nahin karenge
 Taking a few videos of Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital will not do anything
 aap abhi bhi swasthya se jude asli masalon se bhaag rahe hai
 This is not a one-day affair
 aaj mukhyamantri nitish kumaar pehali baar shri krishna medical kalege gaye
 Reporting on this incident has been going on for so many days, but after several days when the Chief Minister goes to the hospital, he comes to know that there are no doctors in the hospital and cleanliness is not right
 yah tab pataa chalaa jab mukhyamantri se pehle bihar ke swasthya mantri ja chuke hai
 The health minister of the center has gone there
 iske baad bhi agar aspataal kii safai thik nahin he or vahaan paryaapt doctor nahin hai to sawaal vahi he ki in dauron se kya hasil ho jayega
 Nitish Kumar is completing the formality of the visit by going to the ICU ward here or looking at his own picture of the health system of Bihar
 shri krishna medical kalege bihar ke pehle mukhyamantri ke naam par bana he
 It was also inaugurated by Bihar Chief Minister Daroga Prasad Rai
 aaj yahaan ek mukhyamantri hi to daura kar rahe the lekin 59 saal ke itihaas main is medical kalege main bal rog visheshgy banane ke liye post graduate kii seat nahin he
 It is a medical college, it also studies and has a hospital
 agar is aspataal kii yah haalat he ki itani tabaahi ke baad mukhyamantri ko doctor kam nazar aayaa to phir baaki kii kya sthiti hogi aap andaaza kar sakate hai
 This hospital does not have PG studies to make pediatricians
 ab jab sawaal uthaa he to media main principal kaa intervyuu aane laga he ki swasthya sachiv ne piji kii seat ke liye prastaav maanga he
 The answer to every question is announcement, proposal
 49 saal kaa kalege he, ab prastaav mangane kaa khyaal aayaa he taaki jaldi se gussa shant ho yaa dhul jhonka ja sake
 If there were ten post-graduate seats here, there would have been some doctors to handle in an emergency
 isi aspataal main surgery or gaini vibhaag main post graduate kii das-das siten dene kii baat hui thi magar assistant professor kii bahaali hi nahin ho saki to yahaan piji kii seat nahin ai
 Think surgery is done here but post graduate studies of surgery is not done
 pichley saat saal main yahaan teen baar 100 se adhik bacchon ke marane kii ghatana hui he
 Even after this, there was no separate ward for acute encephalitis syndrum
 isaki chunautiyon se nibatane ke liye yahaan padhane vaale chaatro ko post graduate kii seat nahin he
 SK Medical College was established in 1970
 itnaa purana medical kalege he or yahaan surgery or bal rog vibhaag main post graduate kii seat nahin he
 But private medical colleges in Bihar have all post graduate seats
 iskaa sambandh dhandhe se he, siton ko bechney se he
 Understand this privet kalejon main post graduate kii seat kii fees karod rupee hoti he
 Since poor children go to government hospitals, die or are referred to Delhi or Patna in the name of treatment, no one gets to know
 mukhyamantri ne daura to kiya magar media se baat nahin kii
 The press release was issued and the Chief Secretary addressed the press
 yahaan bacchon kaa ward nahin ban sakaa lekin 109 bacchon kii maut ke laanchhan se bachane ke liye dharmashala banane kii baat ho rahi he
 Then why can't Dharamshala be built in all the hospitals of Bihar to stop the relatives of the patients? Is everything being asked to get a thick headline in the next day's newspaper so that the news of the death of 109 children is shortened
 main haryana ke jhajjar main ban rahe neshnal cancer institute le chalata hum
 Two or two prime ministers are involved in this
 janvari 2014 main manmohan singh aadharshila rakhte hai
 Prime Minister Modi inaugurates in February 2019
 2015 main jepi nadda swasthya mantri rahete hue bhoomi pujan karte hai
 By 2018, this 710-bed cancer hospital should have been ready as the Prime Minister's Office was monitoring it
 iske baad bhi jab teen saal baad 2019 main pradhanmantri modi ne iskaa udghaatan kiya to maatr 20 bistar hi bane the
 While JP Nadda tweets on 21 October 2016 and says that this hospital should be operational by April 2018
 mantri rahete hue jepi nadda ne twit kiya tha
 But when the Prime Minister goes inaugurating, only 20 beds were ready in two years
 20 bistaron ko baaki suvidhaon se las kar chaalu karne main jab teen saal kaa vakt lag gaya to bihar main nitish kumaar ek saal main 900 se adhik bistar jod denge
 In its 49-year history, only 610 beds are connected here
 is hisaab se har saal 10-15 bed kii hi badhottaree hogi
 The Chief Minister did not say anything about where the doctors would bring 1500 beds
 sabko pataa he buudhvaar kii hedline badi chhapegi
 Estimate whether 900 beds will be made in Bihar within a year
 isliye hedline luutane vaali khabaron ko thik se samajhie
 There is a difference between political statement and reality
 jhajjar kaa udhaaharan diya taaki aap muzaffarpur ko lekar ho rahi ghoshnaaon ko samaj sakenge
 There is already a 300-bed super specialty hospital which will be ready soon
 is tarah ke aspataal main prati bed kii laagat 80 lakh se ek karod hoti he
 It covers all expenses from building to bed, equipment
 to kya nitish kumaar 1500 bed ke liye 1500 karod rupee kaa bajet paas karne vaale hai
 When will you pass? When are the 2500 crore to build a 2500-bed super specialty hospital? If you want to build a multi-specialty hospital, then the cost per bed in such hospital is 40 to 45 lakhs
 to bhi 750 karod ke aasapaas kaa kharchaa aayega
 Has the Bihar government approved the budget? isliye hedline se saavdhaan rahen
 Not only this, 2500 beds were announced in the same district
 isamen teen aspataal ban jaaenge
 Wouldn't it be better if these hospitals were built in the surrounding district
 motihaari main bhi ban jaataa he or begusarai main bhi
 Unless you understand the structure of hospitals, 109 will not understand the causes of death of children and will not prevent such an accident in the coming time
 15 saal se nitish kumaar mukhyamantri hai
 The situation is that they have to give orders to call doctors from Patna and Darbhanga, even when 130 children have died
 2014 main jab yahaan da harshavardhan aae the tab kaha tha ki shri krishna medical kalege main embibies kii siton kii sankhya 150 se badhaakar 250 kar denge
 From 2014 to 2019, there are only 100 seats so far
 balki 2014 main 139 bacchon ke marane kii ghatana se pehle medical council aaf india ne is kalege kii siten 100 se ghataakar waapas 50 kar di thim, jise ghatana ke baad 100 kar diya gaya
 It is evident that there is a shortage of doctors in this hospital
 doctoron par dabaav he
 The system has also delivered doctors in this condition
 doctoron ne bhi khud ko is haalat main pahunchaae rakhaa he
 The result of which is the death of 109 children
 jo log nitish kumaar ke jane par pradarshan karne gaye the unhen ye kaam mukhyamantri ke patna laut jane ke baad bhi karte rahanaa chahie
 If public pressure comes, then a hospital will be built and a doctor will also be formed
 saal 2012 main nitish kumaar hi mukhyamantri the jab 178 bachche mare the, 2014 main nitish kumaar hi mukhyamantri the jab 139 bachche mare the, 2019 main nitish kumaar hi mukhyamantri hai jab 130 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 Seven years was enough time to equip the hospital with all the facilities
 kuch sudhaar hua magar naam kaa hi
 At this time, the condition of the ICU in this hospital should also be understood
 17 dinon main 130 bachche mare to aanan fanan main pediatric isiu kii sankhya chaar kar di gai
 Before that, this hospital had only one PICU which has 14 beds
 baad main chaar or isiu banaae gaye or tab sankhya 40 bed kii hui jo abhi bhi paryaapt nahin he
 The wards of other departments were converted into icus
 jahaan ek bistar par chaar-chaar bacchon ko rakhaa gaya he
 It should be called Aircondition General Ward instead of ICU
 kya aapane aisa isiu dekha he jahaan pachaason log chal rahe hon
 The minister is visiting
 camera andar se ricard kar rahaa ho
 The Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine has a guideline regarding ICU on its site
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kisi aspataal main 100 bed par ek se chaar isiu bed hona chahie
 These can have a capacity of 8 to 12 beds
 sava sau se dedh sau varg feet aria main ek bed hona chahie, lekin yahaan aap dekh sakate hai ki har bistar ek-duusare ke kitne kareeb he
 There is no partition between the beds
 isiu main har koi aa-ja nahin saktaa
 There should be only one entry exit except emergency
 magar yahaan to aap haalat dekh lijie kya he
 This hospital also does not have special facility for doctors
 doctoron ne bataaya ki pani kii suvidha nahin he
 So what would be the condition of the patients
 is aspataal kaa isiu general ward hi nahin aspataal ke baahar kaa maidan ban gaya he
 You know that the ICU also has a sound limit
 dhimi awaz zaruri hoti he lekin yahaan har vyakti jor jor se baat kar rahaa he
 Reporters are also filing their reports screaming from there
 bihar kii janata mariz ko ambulance par ladakar gaanv se patna le janaa samajhati he lekin apane shahar or kasbe ke aspataal kii chintaa nahin karti he
 You should know that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar does his annual checkup in Delhi at AIIMS
 shukr he america nahin jate hai, magar patna main bhi to ames he, phir nitish kumaar ko dilli kyon aana padataa he
 You will know when you find the answer to this question
 tabhi da harshavardhan bhi jhunjhala se gaye kyonki ve jaanate hai ki itani jaldi kuch nahin ho saktaa
 When the hospital was better, obviously the primary health center would also be better
 is vakt primary health centre main do bistaron vaale isiu ke banane kii baat kahi ja rahi he lekin aap samaj sakate hai jab zila aspataal kaa isiu is haal main he to vahaan kya hoga
 The ICU is not formed by placing the oxygen cylinder next to the bed
 to doctor kyon nahin hai, yah sawaal poochne main aapane der kar di
 Doctors will be brought from Patna and Darbhanga, but whether there are enough doctors
 dhyaan rakhie ki bihar main lu lagane se 100 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 What will be the impact on emergency medicine in those hospitals? patna medical kalege main bhi 40 fisadi doctoron kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of 50 percent of doctors in Darbhanga Medical College
 bihar main doctoron ke 11, 734 pad sweekrut hai, 6000 ke kareeb hi doctor hai
 Of this, around 2000 doctors are on contract
 2300 hi sthaayee hai
 There is a doctor in Bihar at 17,685 people
 ganimat he ki media abhi muzaffarpur ke aspataal ko lekar hi sakriy he
 If he starts going to other hospitals, then the hospital will look less, the poverty of Bihar will be seen more
 isi ke saath shri krishna medical kalege aspataal ke anya vaardon kii tasviren dekhen to aapako andaaza ho jayega ki garibi vardaan he
 People living in the corridors here would have been poor and would have been tagging hashes on Twitter in English
 ve chupchaap pade hue hai
 If you look at the Guinee ward, Maternity ward, Pediatric ward and Emergency ward properly, then you will know the condition of patients in this hospital
 kisi bhi sarkari aspataal kii yahi haalat hoti he
 Are poor people mahilaayein doctor ko bhagwaan maan leti hai or bhagwaan ke sahare apana jivan chhod detii hai
 There is no system in between
 aspataal kam yah railway kaa platform zyaada najar aata he
 The hospital also has MBBS students
 jinhen aakhri saal main internship kerani hoti he
 The state government gives them an allowance of Rs 15,000 per month
 dhai maheene se yahaan ke chaatro ko kaam kii selary nahin mili he, phir bhi ve kaam kar hi rahe hai
 Does not know that interns working in medical colleges across Bihar have not received salary
 yah to haalat he
 Will shouts of anchors be cured
 ho jaae to kitni acchhee baat he
 By the way, let us tell you that this coverage will give channels a rating, patients and poor will not get health care
 kaise bataata hum, policy research studies piares kaa ek vishleshan mila he
 See the condition of health budget of Bihar
 2016-17 kaa bajet kharch he 8,234 karod
 The budget for 2017-18 is 7,002 crores
 ek hazaar karod kii kami aa jaati he bajet main
 The budget on urban health decreases by 18 percent
 gramin swasthya par bajet main 23 pratishat kii kami aati he
 What do you gain from knowing this? There is an advantage, it is good material for writing Facebook posts
 aap likhie jab bihar kaa swasthya bajet hi 7000 karod kaa he to 1500 bistaron vaala super speshiality aspataal banane ke liye 1500 karod or 2500 bistaron vaale super speshiality vaala aspataal banane ke liye 2500 karod kis khate se aayega
 Who will pay so much money? 2017-18 ke bajet main bihar ne aspataal banane ke liye 819 karod kaa hi bajet rakhaa tha
 In 2018, the Bihar cabinet took a decision that Patna Medical College will be made the largest hospital in the world
 vahaan 1700 bed hai jise badhaakar 5462 bed kiya jayega
 It will take seven years to complete and the budget will be 5540 crores
 aap khush ho jaaenge sunakar
 But ask a question, where will the doctor come from
 isaki kya taiyaari he
 Have medical seats been increased in the medical colleges of Bihar
 sarkari aspataal main selary kam he, pension nahin he isliye bhi doctor nahin aa rahe hai
 They go to corporate to earn more money
 abhi media ye kar rahaa he ki nal kii sukhi tonti dikhaakar hai tauba kar rahaa he vah swasthya sevaaon ko lekar bade or kade sawaal nahin kar rahaa he
 More than 100 children have died
 ham abhi bhi mazaaq kar rahe hai

 From time to time, leaders are also seen trying to prove it wrong, but sometimes even in public, the difference of views is clearly visible
 aisa hi ek maamla soshal media ke jariye bhi ab saamne aayaa he, jahaan madhya pradesh main jari baari barish ko lekar siem kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya donon ne alag-alag raay jaahir kii he
 Actually, it started on Monday when Kamal Nath tweeted tauntingly on the old statements of the Bharatiya Janata Party on the heavy rains and wrote that though the rain has nothing to do with politics, but some people called it politics and our Connected with the government
 us din se hi indra devtaa pradesh par itane meharbaan hai ki barsaat ruk hi nahin rahi he
 Water and water all around, the whole drought is over
 sandesh aa gaya ki pradesh main ab sab acha-acha hi hoga
 Apparently, tightening the tension, Kamal Nath described the heavy rains in the state as good
 haalanki purv kendriya mantri or congress ke varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya siem kamalnath ke vichaaron se sahamat nahin dikhe
 On Tuesday, Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted, expressing concern over the heavy rains, that in many districts the situation is still serious and the rains have caused a lot of damage
 sarkaar se meraa nivedan he ki prabhavit kshetron main puri mustaidi se raahat-bachaav kaary chalaae jaaen jisase samay rahete sthiti par kaabo paaya ja sake evam prabhaviton ko suraksha or sahaara mil sake
 Scindia said that it is very worrying that heavy rains have lost many lives in different parts of Madhya Pradesh
 ishwar se prarthana he ki ve divangat atmaaon ko shaanti pradaan karen evam shokakul parijanon ko yah aghat sahane kii shakti den
 Scindia's tweet was completely opposite to Chief Minister Kamal Nath's tweet
 donon ke twit ko padhakar mana ja rahaa he ki donon netaaon ke bich manmutav kii jo khabaren samay-samay par baahar aati he usamen kahin naa kahin sachai bhi he
 However, on Tuesday, Chief Minister Kamal Nath also tweeted expressing concern over the heavy rains
 pradesh ke kai hisson main baari barish ke baad hue jalairao or logon kii maut par chintaa jataate hue kamalnath ne ek ke baad ek teen twit kiye
 He wrote that whatever is the loss of life due to heavy rains, the government is with the affected families in this hour of grief
 raahat va bachaav kaary nirantar jari he
 Heavy rains are continuing in various parts of the state, there is a possibility of heavy rains in the next few hours, due to heavy rains, the river-drain is on the rise
 baari barish ko dekhte hue puure pradesh main prashasan ko purv se hi nirdesh die gaye hai ki aapadaa prabandhan ke tahat jitne bhi jalairao vaale kshetra hai, vahaan par vishesh chaukasee va saavdhaanee barti jaae
 Adequate arrangements should be made to prevent any kind of loss of life
 sarkaar prabhavit pariwaron ke saath mustaidi se khadi he, unki puri madad kii jaaegi
 In fact, Kamal Nath tweeted tauntingly on an old statement of former CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan on Monday
 pradesh main jab barish nahin ho rahi thi to shivaraj singh chouhan ne vartmaan kamalnath sarkaar par tanj kasate hue kaha tha ki yah sarkaar beimaan he isliye pradesh main barish nahin ho rahi he
 Responding to this, on Monday, tweeted Shivraj in Kamal Nath
 anna hajaare banaam krishi mantrisharad pavarladai 1993 se hi chali aa rahi he
 Hazare has been accusing Pawar and his colleagues in Maharashtra of corruption for nearly two decades
 or jab hajaare ne dilli pahunchakar apane abhiyaan ke tahat pavaar ko nishaanaa banaaya to pavaar nebhrashtachar par mantriyon ke samooh(jioem) se turant istipha de diya
 Hazare had raised the question, "ministers like Sharad Pawar whom everyone knows that they have a lot of land in Maharashtra, how are they heading the committee that will draft the Lokpal Bill?" According to the affidavit he had filed before the election, he had 8
 73 karod ru
 Was a movable asset of hajaare ke ek sahyogi ne kaha, ''ham in atakalon ke boote aarope laga rahe the ki unke paas kaaphi jameen he lekin benami
 "this associate admitted that he had no evidence to support his claim
" lekin unhone aage kaha, ''shaayad pavaar bhi nahin jaanate ki unke paas kitni jameen he
 There was speculation about Pawar's immediate resignation, the thief has a speck in his beard
 jaahir he, pavaar ko nishaanaa banane kii fori vajah yah he ki hajaare ne is maratha netaa ko 30 march ko patr likhakar kaha tha ki ve unke virodh main shaamil ho jaaen
 a colleague of Hazare said, "pawar refused, saying how he would oppose the government in which he is involved
" '' sahyogi ne aage kaa, ''pavaar hamaare nishane par nahin hai
 Our target is the Lokpal Bill
 ''cabinet mantri or ensipi ke netaa, prafull patel ne kaha he, ''kisi tarah ke aparaadh bodh kaa sawaal kahaan uthta he? garam maahaul main, kisi bhi tarah ke anaavashyak vivaad se bachane ke liye unhone khud ko alag kar liya
 "maharashtra BJP general secretary Vinod Tawad says," Pawar tried to resign and called himself Paksaf, but why did he not resign as minister? "pawar knows how much Hazare can hurt
 2003 main hajaare ne maharashtra main congress rakanpa sarkaar ko rakanpa ke chaar mantriyon ke khilaaf jaanch ke aadesh dene ko majaboor kar diya tha
 Hazare also expressed surprise at the presence of Kapil Sibal in the gom, saying that such a person who claims no harm in the 2G scam can be part of the Group of Ministers
 sibbal ne hajaare ke hamale kii andekhi kii
 The relationship with Shahid Balwa (jailed in the 2G scam) and the controversy over Pawar's suspected role in the IPL controversy were yet to stop, with another controversy coming to light
 istife se pehle pavaar ne media se kaha, ''main khush hounga agar aap mujhe bhrashtachar samet tamaam muddon par gathit mantri samoohon se mukti dilaa den
 The joint committee set up to prepare the Lokpal Bill has become a mere Congress Civil Society panel
 isamen rakanpa (or upie ke anya sahyogiyon) ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 An NCP leader said, "saheb (pawar) knew that he would not be included in this committee
 istipha dekar unhone khud ko darkinar kiye jane se bachaa liya
 "UPA allies feel inside that the Congress is bent on sacrificing its allies on the issue of corruption so that it gets a clean chit
" rakanpa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ''dramuk ke baad, aglaa nishaanaa rakanpa he
 "of course when it comes to controlling inflation, Pawar is an easy scapegoat for the Congress
 rakanpa ke sachiv jitendra awad kehete hai, ''in dinon netaaon ko nishaanaa bananaa sabase aasaan ho gaya he
 And Pawar does not say anything, so it is easiest to target him
 '' jaahir he, pavaar kii mushkilon ko dekhakar yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki unke liye samay bura chal rahaa he

 The latest report tabled in the cag's Parliament on the online (e) auction of coal mines stated that in these auctions, in 11 coal blocks, company groups made more than one bid through their subsidiaries or joint ventures
 aise main uski raay he ki ho saktaa he isse pratispardhaa baadhit hui ho
 The report said, "the audit did not arouse confidence that a potential level of competition would have been achieved in the auction of 11 coal mines in the first two bards

 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf ab congress netaa jairam ramesh bhi supreme court pahunch gaye hai
 Jairam Ramesh has said in his petition that this law violates the secular constitution of India
 bhedbhaav ke rup main yah muslim pravaasiyon ko baahar nikaalata he or keval hinduon, sikhon, baudhon, isaayiyon, parsiyon or jainiyon ko naagarikta detaa he
 At the same time the basic structure of the Constitution and its intention to explicitly discriminate against Muslims
 unhone kaha kiye samvidhan main nihit samanta ke moulik adhikaar kaa ulanghan karata he or dharm ke aadhaar par bahishkaar karke avaidh apravasiyon ke ek varg ko naagarikta dene kaa iraadaa rakhata he
 Every citizen is entitled to the protection of equality
 jairam ramesh ne kaha ki yadi koi vidheyak kisi vishesh shrenee ke logon ko nikaalata he to use rajya dwaara vaazib tehraaya janaa chahie
 Citizenship can be based not only on religion, but on birth
 prashn he ki bharat jaise dharmanirpeksh desh main naagarikta yogyata kii kasuti kaise ho sakati he

 The matter of the Citizenship Amendment Act has now reached the Supreme Court
 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf pis party ne bhi supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition calls for the repeal of the law as unconstitutional
 party kaa kahana he ki yah kanoon bharat ke samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 kaa ulanghan karata he
 This is against the basic structure / preamble of the Constitution
 dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta nahin di ja sakati
 If its purpose is to give citizenship to the oppressed minority people in neighboring countries - like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, then why not consider the minority people living in other neighboring countries ie China, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, who are not considered in their countries Is also being persecuted
 utpeedan keval dharm ke aadhaar par nahin kiya jaataa, balki yah anya kaarnon jaise raajnneetik, bhashaa yaa ling ke aadhaar par bhi hota he
 Then why Muslims are not included in this law

 chhattisgarh main jaivik kheti ko badhaava dene ke liye sarkaar ne kisaanon se jaivik chaaval kii paidaavaar karne kii salaah di or unhen bharosa dilaayaa ki isse unki aamadani doguni bhi ho jaaegi, or ab vahi isaki kharidari se batch rahi he
 The government also told them that their crop would be purchased immediately, but when the farmers met the government's intention, the government lost its position
 jaivik chaaval kisaanon kekhet-khalihanonmen padaa hua he, lekin kharidaar nahin mil rahe
 Nor was any government arrangement made for the sale of that rice
 chaaval yun hi pade rahane se kisaan pareshaan hai
 The government had suggested changes in the crop cycle
 The government gave several tips to the rice producing farmers in Chhattisgarh to increase their income
 sarkaar kii daleel thi ki varsh 2022 tak yadi unhen apni aamadani doguni kerani he to vefasalchakr main badlaav ke siddhant par kaam karen
 The government also assured the farmers to grow rice in an organic way
 isse unhen unki paidaavaar kii oonchi keemat milegi, lagbhag doguni
 The government army gave the recipe of organic farming to the farmers and also showed big dreams
 kisaan sarkari afasaron ke ghere main aa gaye
 He planted organic crops in his fields by doing organic farming instead of the normal rice crop
 fasalon kii khub dekhbhaal bhi kii
 Only dung manure was used to create distances from chemical, pastricidal and other chemicals
 kisaanon kii mehnat rang laai or acchhee paidaavaar hui, lekin ye kisaan us samay sakate main aa gaye jab bazaar main jaivik chaaval kaa koi kharidaar nahin mila
 According to farmers, the cost in organic farming is more than one and a half times per acre compared to normal farming
 jaivik kheti vaala alag-alag kism ke chaaval par unhen 60 se 70 rupye prati kilo tak laagat aati he
 After this, there is a separate cost of transporting that rice to the market for selling, while in the market, buyers ask for this rice at a maximum rate of 40 to 50 rupees
 kisaanon ke mutabik baari maatra main jaivik chaaval unke paas jamaa ho gaya he
 Farmers allege that the government has not made any government arrangement to sell this rice, so why produce again? Chhattisgarh is called a rice bowl
 yahaan ke alag-alag hisson main sau se zyada kismon ke chaaval kii salanaa buaai hoti he
 Many farmers in the state grow crops up to three times a year
 kisaanon kii aamadani badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne fasal chakra parivartan par jor diya taaki paidaavaar bhi acchhee ho or fasal kaa acha daam bhi mili
 Rice has to be certified: The government assured the farmers that organic farming would prove beneficial for them
 ye kisaan sarkaar par bharosa kar baithe, lekin sarkaar yah baat bhul gai ki is paidaavaar kii kharidi bikri ke liye bazaar muhaiyaa karana bhi uski javaabadari he
 On the other hand, the government argues that now the farmer has to get his rice certified
 rajya ke mahasamund, durg, dhamtari, baalod, bemetara, mungeli, kawardha, raipur or sarangarh main hajaaron khet-khaliyaanon main jaivik chaaval damp padaa he
 Farmers are neither getting a good market for its sale nor buyers
 chhattisgarh main manusan sir par he
 Many farmers' farm barns are filled with organic rice
 aise kisaanon ke saamne ab samasya aan padi he ki ve dobaaraa jaivik kheti apanaae yaa phir apni paramparaagat paddati se samaanya chaaval kii paidaavaar karen
 Millions of devotees who came to Navakalevar while entering the temple of Lord Jagannath in Puri, Odisha, rarely thought that the roof of the temple from which Jagmohan stood and saw Lord Jagannath, could ever collapse
 navaklevar utsav ke dauraan bhagwaan jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra kii murtiyon ko badalakar unki jagah nai murtiyon sthapit kii jaati hai
 This is the place of Jagmohan Temple where devotees stand and see Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra
 vah to lohe ke mote-mote 14 pipe or upar kii taraf chaar pipe tamaam clampon sahit chat kii beam ko sanbhale hue hai varanaa yahaan kabhi bhi koi haadasa ho saktaa he
 According to the Archaeological Survey of India, the restoration of the temple is very important
 hinduon main manyata he ki mahaprabhu jag ke nath hai
 But due to the tussle between the temple's non-governmental governing committees and the central and state government, this fourth Dham of salvation has been yearning for restoration
 alam yah he ki mandir kii chat kaa plaster ukhd rahaa he or pathar apni jagah chhodie lage hai
 After the 11th century renovation, the maintenance of this temple has been completely ignored
 aise main rojaanaa baari sankhya main aane vaale shraddhaluon kaa darshan ke vakt dhyaan bant jaataa he
 They see thick iron pipes carrying the beams of Jagmohan's roof, which narrow the entrance to the sanctum sanctorum, and stare
 mandir ke sanchaalan se jude log dabi jabaan se bataate hai ki 2004 main pehali baar sangyaan main aayaa ki chat kaa plaster teji se ukhd rahaa he
 The oral complaint was inspected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and planned its renovation
 lekin bhagwaan jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra ke vigrah kahin or sthapit karke jirnoddhar tathaa choti-moti marammat kaa kaam shuru karne ke ees ke faisle par mandir ke sevayaton kii sthaneey samiti or rajya sarkaar kii gathit samiti ke bich ek raay na banane se yah kaam talataa rahaa
 Jagannath Bastia, a local senior journalist who interferes with the temple system, says, ‚Äú17 meetings have been held in the last 11 years but the situation is deteriorating rather than getting worse
 ‚Äù darasal, ees kii report par ek raay nahin ban paa rahi
 For generations, sevayats who have done all the work in the Jagannath temple, from worship, say that the removal of the Deities and the creation of Jagmohan will break the ancient tradition
 mandir main 36 prakaar kii seva karne kii vajah se ye sabhi sevaayat 36 shreniyon main bante hai
 In this way Navakalavar passed but the work on Jagmohan, which is very important for the safety of the devotees, could not start
 isaki gambhirtha 24 agast, 2015 ko mandir ke mukhya prashaasak suresh mahapaatr (iees) kii us chitthee se jhalkati he jo unhone ees ke mahanideshak rakesh tiwari ko likhi thi
 On July 19, Mahapatra, after inspecting the Bhubaneswar Circle's Superintending Archaeologist and Chairman of the Technical Committee, along with other members and servants, immediately conveyed the seriousness of the temple's condition to the ASI Director General by phone
 unhone saaf kaha tha ki jagah-jagah pathar ukhd rahe hai
 There have been cracks in the pillars and roof etc
 kisi tarah kaamchalaoo vyavastha ke jariye biimon ko thodi majbootee di gai he
 But how long will it last? Due to the 14 pipes supporting the beam, the width of the gate between Jagmohan and Garbha Griha has been reduced and devotees have to face heavy problems
 jaise-taise shraddhaluon kii bheed ko niyantrit kiya ja rahaa he
 It was also said in the letter that many places in the temple complex are becoming dilapidated
 mandir ke uttar-purv kii ore ke khambhe bhi pathar chhodie lage hai
 All the action was up to the papers, when this entire matter came to the notice of the state government, on the instructions of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on October 6, 2015, Law Minister Dr
 arun kumaar sahu ne bhubaneshwar main mandir se sambandhit pakshon kii baithak bulaai

 According to the Law Minister, it was decided in the meeting that a high-level team would discuss the renovation project report from the Director General of ASI in Delhi and take directions
 unke mutabik disambar ke pehle hakrate se kaam chaalu kiya janaa tha
 On the question of getting the Deity of God installed and working elsewhere, he says that ASI will do better according to its own
 sabase zyada vivaad ees kii isi baat par he ki jagmohan ke jirnoddhar ke dauraan bhagwaan jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra ke vigrah ko apane sthaan se hataakar kaam ho yaa bina hataae? yah faisla philhal ees ke mahanideshak rakesh tiwari par chhod diya gaya he
 On the other hand, Jagannath Sawaimahapatra, senior Deitapati (sevayat) of the temple, says, ‚Äúthere should be no objection to the restoration of Jagmohan by installing the Vigraha elsewhere
 haa, mahaprabhu ke dainik kaarykram kii sadiyon puraani parampara khandit nahin honi chahie
 According to the people of Puri, history is witness that due to the invasion of a king in the past, the Deities of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were secretly taken to Sonpur district
 vahaan teenon vigrah ko patali (jameen main visarjan) kar diya gaya tha
 Later, Adi Shankaracharya came to Puri and established the Deities with the establishment of Govardhan Math
 shankaracharya ne bhagwaan jagannatha kii dainik niti bhi tay kii thi jiskaa aaj tak paalan kiya ja rahaa he
 The irony is that now even in the functioning of the temple, the opinion of Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda of Puri Peeth is not taken
 unki upeksha yahaan charchaa kaa vishay he
 In the June 2014 Rath Yatra of Navakalevar, he was not allowed to climb the chariot and was told that he could not take a servant on the chariot
 shankaracharya abhi mathura main hai
 His personal secretary Manoj Rath explains, "neither the temple's steering committee nor the ASI officials have had any conversation with Shankaracharya, from the renovation and Ratnasinhasan to the shifting of the Deities of Mahaprabhu Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra
 navaklevar main parampara bhi hui khandit?is baar bhagwaan jagannatha ke navaklevar ke brahm parivartan kii dharmik vidhi bhi pehali baar khandit hui
 The rule in this tradition is that the great method of Brahma Parivartan is done just before the deity of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are tried

 Yakub is in this prison
 ullekhneey he ki 1993 bam dhamakon se thik ek din pehle yaqub apane puure parivaar ke saath desh chhodkar chalaa gaya tha
 Please tell that 257 civilians were killed in these blasts
 mumbai ke tamaam jagahon par in dhamaakon ko anjaam diya gaya tha
 After these blasts, Indian intelligence agencies had a lot of trouble in bringing Yakub to India
 or agast 1994 main use bharat laayaa gaya or mumbai kii adaalat main pesh kiya gaya
 During that time it was also said that Yakub Memon surrendered himself in Nepal despite security agencies claiming to have arrested him

 Shantanu Sen was the head of the Special Investigation Force of the CBI which was involved in investigating the blasts

 He tried to explain it

 According to Shantanu, Yakub and his brother Tiger were in Karachi, Pakistan at that time
 hamalon ke mukhya sutaradhar daud ibrahim or tiger memon tab bhi laapata bataae gaye the
 According to Sen, there were deep differences in the Memon family over their return to India
 yaqub or uske parivaar ko pakistan main ghutan mahasoos ho rahi thi
 They felt insecure there
 unhen yah ahsaas hone laga tha ki vah aise maahaul main zyada din tak nahin rah sakate hai or yah bhi pakistani un par zyada bharosa nahin karenge
 According to Sen, IB and RAW officials were in touch with the Memon family

 And trusting this promise, Yakub fully supported the investigation

 After these blasts, Indian intelligence agencies had a lot of trouble in bringing Yakub to India

 According to Sen, there were deep differences in the Memon family over their return to India
 yaqub or uske parivaar ko pakistan main ghutan mahasoos ho rahi thi
 They felt insecure there
 unhen yah ahsaas hone laga tha ki vah aise maahaul main zyada din tak nahin rah sakate hai or yah bhi pakistani un par zyada bharosa nahin karenge
 According to Sen, IB and RAW officials were in touch with the Memon family

 Sen claims that the Memon brothers have not been cheated in any way, no false promise was made to them
 yaqub memon ke bharat aane ke baad usne apane parivaar ke kai anya sadasyon ko bharat aane main kaaphi ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Among those who returned to India from Pakistan were his two other brothers who have been given life imprisonment

 In this column, Raman wrote that Yakub fully supported the investigation
 raman kaa kahana tha ki haalanki yaqub memon kaa role dhamaakon main saaf he, lekin use faansee nahin di jaani chahie
 Yakub Memon's lawyer Shyam Keswani said the same thing
 kesavani kaa daawa he ki sibiai ke ek adhikari opi chatwaal ne vaada kiya tha ki sibiai yaqub memon kii jamaanat kaa virodh nahin karegi
 And trusting this promise, Yakub fully supported the investigation
 baad main kesavani ne aarope lagaaya ki sibiai ne maamle main you-turn liya he
 The comments lekin chatwaal ne enditivi se kaha ki yah galat he
 He says that no CBI official has ever asked me to be lenient in the case
 jahaan tak memon se sahyog kii baat he to chatwaal ne kaha ki yaqub ke paas giraftaar ke samay dhamaakon ke silsile main jo bhi saboot the, use agency ne apane kabje main le liya tha
 They were used during the court case
 yaqub ne saboot apane aap nahin die the, saare saboot baraamad kiye gaye the
 It is notable that one day before the 1993 bomb threats, Yakub left the country with his entire family
 bataa den ki in dhamaakon main 257 nagarikon kii maut ho gai thi
 These blasts were carried out in all places of Mumbai
 in dhamaakon ke baad bhartiya khufia agenciyon ko yaqub ko bharat laane main kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi thi
 And in August 1994, he was brought to India and produced in a Mumbai court
 us dauraan yah bhi kaha gaya ki yaqub memon ne nepal main swayan aatmasamarpan kiya jabaki suraksha agenciyon ne use giraftaar karne kaa daawa kiya tha

 According to Sen, we told him to trust the Indian judicial system

 The food and drink of the children is the most ignored during the examination
 aamtaur par is dauraan bachche coffee or junk food khate hai
 This helps them to stay awake for a long time, but all these are harmful to health
 isliye pariksha ke dauraan bacchon ke liye furd chart banaakar unhen is mushkil samay kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar karen
 Do these 10 changes in children's diet during the exam: 1
 baari or swasth naashte ke saath din kii shuruyaat karen
 Include oats, muesli, upma, khichdi, idli and glucose in their diet, all of which are low glycemic alternatives
 2
 Allow to eat in small amounts but in a short while
 baari maatra main bhojan karne se bacchon ko neend or susti aa sakati he
 Give them a small amount of nutritious food, this will keep them alert and agile
 paushtik aahaar main taaje fal, sookhe mewa, shahad, soup or salad aadi achche vikalp hai
 3
 smriti badhaane vaale khaadya padaarthon ko shaamil karen
 Fish is mainly found in omega-3 fatty acids, which helps to increase memory
 agar baccha machhlee nahin khaataa he to alsi ke beej, kaddu ke beej, til ke beej or soyabean den
 4
 khaane main hydrateed ke stroton ko shaamil karen
 Provide children with a diet that fulfills the lack of water in the body
 sharir main pani kii kami hone se bacchon kaa man baichaiyn ho saktaa he or wo padhai par dhyaan nahin de paaenge
 Give them fresh fruit juices, buttermilk or lemonade or lemon juice and green tea
 5
 Include protein in the diet
 protein urja kaa ek acha or strot he
 Therefore, include sources of protein in the food such as egg, poha, idli, dosa, dhokla etc
 ye rakt or mastishk main tirocine (amino acid) ko badhaata he, ye tantrika koshikaon ke nirmaan main sahaayta karata he
 Also, helps to keep children alert and active
 6
 Do not give too much sugar and sweet things
 chocolate, kukies aadi rakt main sharkara ke str ko badha sakate he
 In such a situation, the stomach feels empty and hunger becomes frequent
 bachche junk food khaane kii maang karte hai, jo ki unke swasthya ke liye hanikaarak he
 7
 pratirohak kshamta badhaane vaale khaadya padaarth den
 Eggs, fish, carrots, pumpkins, green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits cater to vitamin A, c and e deficiency, as well, help to increase the body's immunity and protect children from falling ill during exams
 
 8
 Avoid giving too much caffeine
 pariksha ke dauraan bachche bahut zyada coffee, chaay or cola pinaa chaahate hai, lekin unhen aisi chijen dene se bachein, jisamen caffeine ho
 9
 unke khaane main vitamin ko shaamil karen
 During stressful times of examination, some water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin b complex and c are essential for the body
 ye mul rup se hamen tanaav se ladane main madad karte hai
 Eat brown rice, nuts, fresh vegetables and fruits
 10
 Also, do not let children eat outside food during the exam
 isse bacchon main sankraman hone kaa khatra bad saktaa he
 Avoid eating outside as much as possible
 koshish karen ki restaraan kaa khaanaa naa khaaen

 They do not mean what the leaders said
