 murgipalak chote kisaanon par privet players kii monopoli badhati ja rahi he
 In states like Punjab, Haryana and Himachal, small and medium farmers have started raising voice against these private companies with big names
 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ko chunavi ghoshnaptr kii yaad dilaate hue poltry kisaanon ne kaha he ki nijee companiyaan khule bazaar main prasanskaran yaa mulya sanvardhan ke bina hi apana maal bazaar main utaar rahi hai
 Due to this, broilers are not only selling in direct competition with small farmers, but are also getting farmers by getting tender by paying less
 sarkaar se lagaai guhaar main kisaanon ne kaha ki nijee companiyaan kisaanon kaa shoshan kar rahi hai
 The interests of farmers are being hurt under the eyes of the government
 punjab ke poltry kisaanon ne mukhyamantri se haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress dwaara die gaye vaade kii yaad dilaai he
 The farmers said that they are getting contracts signed in English
 gurumukhi main bhi kam padhe likhe kisaanon ko vah bhashaa samaj nahin aati bina kisi notice ke anubandh samaapt bhi kar diya jaataa he or unhen rin main fansaa kar chhod diya jaataa he
 Farmers involved in poultry and broiler farming want to meet the Chief Minister and express their pain
 congress ne vaada kiya tha ki vah kisaanon ke sabhi prakaar ke anubandhon ko viniyamit karegaa or unke hiton kii raksha karegi
 The manifesto also promised to set up a fully equipped pathology and nutrition laboratory for poultry farmers
 swatantra poltry association ke sukhminder singh ne kaha ki ve nijee companiyon dwaara punjab sanvida krishi adhinium, 2013 ke ulanghan ke bare main jaankaree dene ke liye mukhyamantri se mulaakaat kii maang karenge
 According to Sukhminder, 'contract farming was allowed with a condition that companies would do price promotion and processing before selling their products in the open market
 lekin ye nijee companiyaan kisi tarah kaa mulya sanvardhan nahin kar rahi hai, balki kisaanon ke saath sidhe pratispardhaa main bazaar main jinda or aprasaarit broiler bech rahi hai
 They are selling it at a price even lower than the cost of the farmers, so that the farmers are leading to loss and they are prone to debt '
 ek poltry farm ke maalik sanjay sharma ne kaha ki kisaanon ne sarkaar se aagrah kiya he ki ve punjab sanvida krishi adhinium, 2013 ko sakhti se lagu karen or un companiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karen jo kisaanon ko dhokhaa detii hai
 'it is impossible for companies to leave the farmers who build sheds and other infrastructure to get the companies to where broilers are raised
 haalanki companiyaan ekatarfa anubandh taiyaar karti hai or vah bhi us bhashaa main joki kisaanon kii samaj se pare he
 Many times farmers are paid very little after lifting the broiler and they are left in the middle without any notice
 aakhirkaar, ve karj se grast ho kar rah jate hai'
 In complete violation of the Act, the government has no control over private companies as to what they are doing, whether they follow the quality of chicks and supplements, medicines, vaccination, disinfection norms, animal welfare norms, management of pathogens and diseases
 Have been? As the cabinet expansion is still pending, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh himself is keeping his animal husbandry portfolio
 vibhaag ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, 'anubandhit poltry farming sahit kai muddon par charchaa lambit hai jo ki mukhyamantri ke vyast kaarykram ke kaaran maheenon se lambit hai
 We have a list of private companies that are in violation of contractual farming norms in Punjab but we need the approval of the Chief Minister to speed up the action against them and cancel their licenses
 congress ne apane ghoshnaptr main kaha ki congress sarkaar kheton se khaane tak phydemand mulya shrinkhalaa banane, prasanskaran, cold storage suvidhaayen sunishchit karne ke liye nijee kshetra ke nivesh ko badhaava degaa, parantu iske liye mulya shrinkhalaa ke vibhinn staron par buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh anivaary hoga
 So that new domestic and export markets can be created to improve the income of farmers
 iske alaava kisaanon ke sabhi prakaar ke anubandhon ko unke hiton kii raksha ke liye viniyamit karnaa or unhen uchit vaidhanik tantra ke madhyam se kisi bhi sambhavit shoshan se bachaane ke liye asee vidhanik sanstha main kisaanon kaa paryaapt pratinidhitiv hoga
 a well-equipped pathology and nutrition laboratory will be established across the state for sustainable, healthy, scientific and profitable poultry farming

 kyonki aatankwaadi apane mansoobon ko puraa karne ke liye soshal media kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 They try to attract youth from this platform

 The pull factor has factors such as better economic opportunities, more employment, hope for a better life, which attracts people

 The government did not provide any kind of employment after the year 2009, it is a compulsion to migrate to meet the expenses of the family and loan compulsions from the moneylenders were not given before now, after 2009 Kamdham is not going to Jagdalpur , Living like this is happening

 Tharoor is known for being a prominent leader of the country as well as for his grasp on the English language
 unhone apane twivater handle par america main 'houdi modi' ko lekar ek jaankaree share kii
 But while sharing this information, he made some mistakes
 in galatiyon ke baad logon ne twitor par teji se pratikriya deni shuru kar di
 After this, Tharoor had to explain on this issue
 shashi tharur ne piem modi ke america main yojit kaarykram houdi modi ko mili apaar safalataa kii tulana jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi se kii
 For this, he shared a picture of Jawaharlal Nehru on Twitter
 isamen unhone likhaa ki dekhie america main varsh 1954 main pandit jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi kaa swaagat hua tha
 Neither special public relations campaign nor NRI crowd management was done for this
 isamen tharur se do galtiyaan ho gayi
 The first was that the picture he shared was not from the United States
 duusari galati yah ki unhone indiya gandhi kii jagah india gandhi likh diya
 Nehru & India Gandhi in the US in 1954
 Look at the hugely enthusiastic spontaneous turnout of the American public, without any special PR campaign, NRI crowd management or hyped-up media publicity

 unke is twit ko dekhte hi logon ne soshal media par pratikriya deni shuru kar di
 There was a flood of reactions on Twitter to explain this mistake
 kuch logon ne likhaa ki yah tasviir america kii nahin balki rus kii he
 This shows the real culture of the Congress
 kuch logon ne sawaal uthaaya ki 1954 main indira gandhi kisi pad par nahin thi, phir jawahar laal nehru unhen kis haisiyat se rus lekar gaye
 i am told this picture (forwarded to me) is probably from a visit to the USSR and not the US
 Even if so, it still doesn't alter the message: the fact is that former pms also enjoyed popularity abroad

 Now in such a situation, the question arises that in the eyes of the law, what is the meaning of making such a video and taking such pictures? So the answer is simple, whether it is by deception or with the consent of any of your partner, if anyone takes such pornographic photos or makes videos, it is wrong, illegal in the eyes of law
 kanoon ke jaankaar bataate hai ki information technology act 2000 ke mutabik-1
 In such cases, the police has the right to directly file a case
 2
 That is, the police can automatically take cognizance of the case without any complaint
 3
 It is so important that in this the police have to tell where they got such CD or pornographic material
 4
 If they downloaded it, what was the link and someone handed it to them, then what was that source
 5
 Then to prove the truth of such material, it is also necessary for the police to conduct a forensic investigation

 It is clear from the moving pictures of the video that the camera is running

 Apart from the person who holds the camera at this time, there is no scope of anyone else being in this room
 kyonki ek taraf camera chupaane vaala shaks he or duusari taraf diwaar
 Sandeep Kumar goes naked within a minute and a half of hiding the camera in its current condition
 in dedh minute ke dauraan naa to is kamare yaa camere main koi teesraa shaks najar aayaa or naa hi kisi or kii koi aawaaj hi sunai di

 ram jethmalani ne indian express main likhe apane lekh ko arun jetali ko dikhaaya or poocha ki kya aapane ise padhaa he
 So Arun Jaitley's lawyers objected to this

 On this, Arun Jaitley said whether Arvind Kejriwal has given you permission to say these words, if given, then i am going to increase the amount of defamation of 10 crores
 iske baad jetali ne ye bhi kaha ki apmaan kii ek seemaa hoti he
 In the fierce debate in the jaitley-kejriwal defamation case even today in the High Court, Jaitley said, "jethmalani is casting out his own enmity
 agar isi tarah ke durbhaavnapurna sawaal puche jaaenge to main apni manahani kii 10 karod kii rakam ko badha saktaa hu
 "significantly, Jethmalani was constantly using the word CROOK for Arun Jaitley in his questions, to which Jaitley and his lawyers objected strongly
 jetali ne kaha ki aap nijee jindagi ko lekar hamale kar rahe hai ye thik nahin he
 After this Jethmalani said that i am meeting the will of my client
 or hameshaa apane client se cese se samajhane ke liye miltaa hu
 Ram Jethmalani also said in court that Arun Jaitley, who fought in bringing black money, turned the water on him

 During the court proceedings in the film 'pink', there has been a successful attempt to show a mirror to the society, who judge women only by their clothes

 Through this film, Bengali film director Anirudh Roy Chaudhary has made his debut in Hindi cinema
 desh kii aabaadi ke 14
 8 percent people are suffering from hunger problem
 In 2017-18, more than 19 crore people were forced to go to sleep every day
 Supreme Court has called for answers from the central and state governments on the problem of hunger in the country
 supreme court ne poocha ki jo log saarvajanik vitaran pranali (peedies yaa rashan system) se alag thalag hai, unke liye 'saamudayik kichan' jaisaa prabandh kyon nahin kiya jaataa
 Let us tell you about 14 of the country's population

 The PIL filed by social worker Anun Dhawan cites a report from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
 report ke mutabik, 2017-18 main har din 19 karod se zyada log bhukhe sone ko majaboor the
 The report also stated that in 2015-16, 23 percent of men and 53 percent of women aged 15–49 were victims of anemia (anemia)

 15 lakh karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 Also 1 for PDS in 2018-19
 74 lakh karod rupee aavantit kiye gaye
 In the same period the government only for food subsidies 1
 69 lakh karod rupee jari kiye
 According to PIL, despite this, there are serious flaws in the implementation of the current operational scheme
 piiel main court se is maamle main dakhal dene kii guzarish kii gai he taaki shahari garibon or begharon ko garm khaanaa baanta ja sake
 For this, the Jharkhand Chief Minister Dal Bhat Yojana, Amma Kitchen in Tamil Nadu, Anna Kitchen in Andhra Pradesh and Aadhaar Canteen of Odisha have been cited
 sarkaron ko court se noticebeete 2 sitambar kocentre sarkaarko jari ek notice main supreme court ne poocha ki kya shahari garibon ke liye saamudayik kichan jaisi koi rashtriya yojana lagu kii ja sakati he
 In response to this, the central government told the court that the matter is with the state governments as to how they implement the food distribution scheme

 indore-patna express haadase main jis tarah kaa bhayanak manjar saamne aayaa he uske liye bhartiya railway khud jimmedaar he
 Bypassing issues like outdated tracks, old technology bins and severe shortage of safety security staff, the Railway Ministry was trying to rob the applause of the people through Twitter
 Is the first responsibility
 indore patna express haadase main yah kahaan ja rahaa he kii train patari se utar gai jisase dibbe ek duusare ke upar chadh gaye
 But the loss of so many people in the event of derailing the train seems to be a matter of anyone's problem
 train main outdated takanic ke isief dibbeisgaadi ke dibbonper najar daalen to iskaa jawaab khud-ba-khud mil jaataa he
 ICT coaches of outdated technology are fitted in this train
 logon ke baari jaan maal ke nuksaan ke liye yahi dibbe jimmedaar hai
 In 2012, the Anil Kakodkar Committee on Safety Affairs recommended that these coaches be completely removed from the Indian Railways
 lekin dibbon ko badale jane kii jagah bullate train ke khwab main dubi sarkaar ab tak puri tarah se aisa nahin kar pai he
 So far, 149 people have died in the accident incident in Pukhrayan near Kanpur
 jaaniye is takanic ke dibbon main kya he kamiisief coach jis takanic par bane hue hai wo beete jamaane kii cheez he
 The report of the Anil Kakodkar Committee, made to suggest railways in the matter of safety and security, recommended the complete removal of ICF coaches from the Indian Railways
 is sifarish ko hue 4 saal ho gaye hai lekin abhi bhi railway main zyaadaatar dibbe isief takanic ke hai
 In such compartments, the box is kept above the bogie
 bogi or dibbe ke bich main judaav bahut zyada majboot nahin hota he
 In such a situation, when a train made of such coaches derails, these coaches are separated from the bogie
 kapaling main gadbadiskaa sidhaa sa matlab yah hua ki railgadee ke dibbe main pahiyon samet nichalaa hissaa alag ho jaataa he
 Because of this, the risk of reversal of these coaches is high
 iske alaava puraani takanic ke in dibbon main ek duusari khami yah he ki inaki kapaling scru kapaling he
 For this reason, when these coaches get derailed, they climb on top of each other, in this process any two cans rip each other and enter inside
 aisi sthiti main dibbon main baithe hue yatriyon kaa kachumar nikal jaataa he
 The Kakodkar Committee gave 106 suggestions The Ministry of Railways in 2011 constituted a High Level Committee for Safety Review under the chairmanship of Dr
 Anil Kakodkar
 anil kakodakar samiti ne 2012 main apni report saunp di thi
 The Manish Committee for Safety Review had made 106 important suggestions in different cases
 in sujhaavon main se 68 suzav ko railway ne puri tareeke se maan liya tha 19 june ko aanshik taur par sweekaar kiya gaya tha or 19 sujhaavon ko railway ne khaarij kar diya tha kakodakar cameti dwaara sujhaaye ke 22 suzav ko railway ne lagu kar diya he or bhi suzav ko lagu karne ke liye antim daur kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 The Kakodkar Committee had suggested a change in the level of organization in General Safety matters and at the same time advocated giving more powers to employees on the working level on the issue of safety
 cameti ne railway kis sefti upkarnon main baari kami kii sthiti ko chintajanak bataaya tha
 Describing the slums illegally located around the railway tracks as a major reduction in the safety of the railway, Kakodkar advocated the removal of these illegal occupations as soon as possible
 kakodakar samiti ne nishkarsh nikaala tha rail patariyon ke kinare avaidh kabje rail yatayaat ke liye ek bada khatra he inaki vajah se rail gadiyon ke durghatnagrast hone kii sthiti main jaan maal kaa baari nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The committee also made these important suggestions Anil Kakodkar emphasized the need to upgrade the signaling and telecommunication system of the railways
 train protection system maujuuda rolling stock or railway pulon ko apgrade karne par samiti ne suzav diya
 Apart from this, the Kakodkar Committee advocated complete abolition of the level crossing of the railway
 kakodakar samiti ne railway se kaha kis vyakti ke maamle main vah apane staff ko puri tareeke se prashikshit karen jisase logon main sefti or security ko lekar jaagrukta bade
 These were the most important suggestions of the Kakodkar Committee

 4- sabase mahatvapurn suzav tha kii deshbhar main railway ke sabhi puraani takanic ke dibbon ko badal kar alechabi tip ke surakshit dibbon main tabdeel kiye jane kii sifarish
 In doing so, it was estimated to cost about 10 thousand crores
 kakodakar cameti ke sujhaavon ke lagu kiye jane main takreeban ek lakh karod rupee kaa atirikt kharchaa aane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 To collect this huge amount of money, it was also suggested that Central government help and safety cess on railway passengers

 All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi has raised strong objections over Sri Ram Ravi Shankar being made an arbitrator on the Ram temple case
 unhone kaha ki hamane ram mandir maamle par supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya he, lekin shrishri ravishankar ko madhyasth banaae jane par aapatti he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Owaisi said that it would have been better if the Supreme Court had appointed an impartial person in the arbitration committee
 shrishri ravishankar nishpaksh vyakti nahin hai
 AIMIM President Owaisi said that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has been making controversial remarks about the Ram temple
 aise main agar unako is maamle main madhyasth banaaya jaataa he, to kya ummid kii ja sakati he?unhone kaha ki shrishri ravishankar ne ram mandir ko lekar 4 november, 2018 ko bhi vivaadaaspad bayaan diya tha or dhamkee di thi ki agar vivaadit jameen par muslimon ne apana daawa nahin choda, to bharat syria kii tarah ho jayega
 Muslims should give up their claim on Ram Janmabhoomi under goodwill
 ovaisi ne kaha, ‘shrishri ravishankar maamle se jude hue hai
 He has already made it clear which side he speaks for
 yah dukhad he ki jo vyakti nishpaksh nahin he, use supreme court ne ayodhya panel main madhyasth niyukt kiya he
 Apart from this, BJP leaders Subramanian Swamy and Nirmohi Akhara have also opposed the appointment of Sree Sri Ravi Shankar in the Ayodhya panel
 vahiin, is maamle par kendriya mantri uma bharti ne kaha, 'ram mandir vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye madhyasth niyukt kiye jane par ham supreme court ko kuch nahin kahenge
 We respect the court, but Ram is a devotee
 ram saare brahmad ke swami he
 So we will say the same thing that just as a mosque cannot be built in Vatican City and a Ram temple in Mecca Medina, no other shrine can be built at the place where Ramlala sits
 vahaan par sirf ramalala kaa mandir hi banegaa
 'let me tell you that on Friday, the Supreme Court has set up an arbitration panel in the Ram temple case, which includes retired Supreme Court Justice Ibrahim Khalifullah, Art of Living head Shri Shree Ravi Shankar and senior Shriram Panchu
 supreme court ke ritred justise ibrahim khaliphullah ko is panel kaa chairman banaaya gaya he
 This arbitration will begin in a week
 iske baad madhyasthata panel ko chaar hafte ke andar isaki stats report deni hogi
 Also, the arbitrators will submit their final report to the Supreme Court within 8 weeks
 supreme court ne madhyasthata kii prakriya ko gupt rakhane kaa bhi nirdesh diya he
 There will be no media reporting on arbitration
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar is madhyasthata ke liye sabhi intjaam karegi

 Today, the look of the film's main lead Varun Dhawan and actor Aditya Roy Kapoor has been released
 ye multistarar period drama 40 ke dashak kii kahani par aadhaarit he
 Varun Dhawan is playing the character of Zafar in the film
 lekin ek report ke anusaar, varun kaa naam jafar nahin balki kuch or rakhaa gaya tha jise salmaan khan kii vajah se unhone badalawa diya tha
 The biggest secret of stigma: Varun Dhawan changed 'apna Naam' because of Salman Khan, Dabangg Salman Khan of Bollywood will now be the brand ambassador of Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ne ek press conference main is baat kii jaankaree di
 Kamal Nath told, "I have discussed this with Salman, he has also agreed to it
 " bataane kii jarurat nahin ki salmaan khan kii paariwarik jaden indore main hai
 Salman Khan will be the brand ambassador of Madhya Pradesh, informed by CM Kamal Nath, Comedian Kapil Sharma takes a dig at issues related to the life of celebs in his show
 lekin ab ve dusron ke sho main jaakar khud ke vivaadon kii sachai beparda karenge
 Arbaaz Khan is bringing a new chat show Pinch by Arbaaz Khan
 isamen mehmaan banenge kapil sharma
 The promo of the show has been released in which Kapil has revealed the truth of the tweet made to PM Modi
 kya sharaab pikar PM narendra modi ko kapil sharma ne kiya tha twit? bataai sachchaikisi bhi film main salmaan khan or shahrukh khan hon to donon kii maujuudagi charchaa main rahati he
 Both of them worked together as lead actors in superhit films like karan-arjun
 iske baad donon ek-duusare kii kai filmon main sirf chemiyo karte dikhe
 Recently, both of them appeared in Shahrukh Khan's Zero
 ab khabar he ki ek baar phir donon actor ek saath najar aaenge
 Salman Khan hero, Shah Rukh will do cameo in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film kareeb do varsh or teen maah ke skim or mishan raaj ke baad modi sarkaar dhanchaagat sudhaaron se najar milaane kii himmat dikhaane lagi he
 The latest reforms are not as blatant and publicity-oriented as the schemes were, though the two-and-a-half-year scheme Raj has a big role to play in this exercise, whose limited success and the gagging emerging from the grassroots are forcing the government to change sides
 is
 rajyon ke str par kendriya skiimon kaa kamjor kriyanvayan bhi team modi ko waapas un sudhaaron kii taraf laayaa he, jo centre sarkaar apane str par kar sakati he
 With the approval of GST from Parliament, the weather of decisions in the Central Government has changed
 saahsee sudhaaron or majboot aarthik faislon par rajnatik sahmati kii ummiden bandhane ke saath modi sarkaar ne pichley do maah main kam se kam chaar badi pahal kii hai, jinhen dhanchaagat sudhaar yaa duusari peedi ke aarthik sudhaaron kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 These four attempts are bold enough and their initial results can be challenging, but the Modi government has understood that there is no option left except for such courage
 pehla bada kadam monatory policy cameti ke gathan or mahangaai par niyantran kaa lakshya tay karne par saamne aayaa
 The government decided that it would try to curb retail, ie consumer inflation, at four per cent (two per cent upside-down, on average six per cent) for the next five years to reduce interest rates
 is faisle se use kai baar neem chabana padaa
 One, the government for which the former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuraman Rajan was subjected to inflation, finally came under the same formula
 or doosraa, bijepi ke 'swami' or 'guru' jo mahangaai kii phikr chhodkar byaaj daren ghataane kaa dabaav bana rahe the, unhen barajna padaa
 The formation of the Monetary Policy Committee and the goal of inflation is structural reform in every way
 mahangaai ghataana, ab rigerv bank or sarkaar kii saajha jimmedaari he, kyonki is samiti main rigerv bank va sarkaar ke teen-teen sadsy honge
 Until now, the Reserve Bank used to base many factors in determining interest rates, such as growth, employment, inflation etc
 is nai vyavastha ke baad mahangaai par kaabo hone tak byaaj daren nahin ghatengi
 This decision is in favor of the bank's deposit holders and consumers, whose returns on deposits and consumption are the biggest hit
 is faisle ke baad byaaj daren ghataane ke vikalp simit ho jaaenge or centre sarkaar ko sakriy rup se mahangaai niyantran ke prayaas karne honge
 Another major improvement is starting in the foot railway
 railway gahari musiibat main he
 The Modi government has not been able to bring very encouraging results in most attempts to replace the railway in the last two and a half years
 railway kaa ghaataa, aakshamata, kism-kism kii asangatiyaan badastoor bani hui hai or dendaree badhati ja rahi he
 Therefore, the railway is set to leave its 95-year-old history
 rail bajet ko kendriya bajet kaa hissaa banane kii taiyaari shuru ho gai he jo ek bade sudhaar kii pehali padchaap he
 There is deep uneasiness and confusion in the Railways and Finance Ministry about this, but the initial courage of this operation has been gathered
 swaabhaavik he ki railway bajet kaa aam bajet main vilay railway ke lambit punargathan kii shuruyaat hogi, jo kai pecho-kham se gujaregaa or sarkaar ko kai baar kadavi goliyaan khaani va railway ko khilaani hongi
 Third, the reorganization of government spending is the tightest link of the budgetary structure, which many governments and expert committees have incurred in trying to solve it
 yah bhartiya bajet vyavastha main duusari peedi kaa sabase bada sudhaar he, jo pratyaksh rup se sarkaar ke daanvi kharchon ko prabhavi banane or ghate ko simit rakhane se judaa he
 Expenditure is shown in two items, Plan and non-plan in the Government Ledger
 is bantwaare se yah bhram hota he ki yojana kharch vikaas ke liye he or gaiyr yojana kharch, anutpaadak kaamon ke liye

 The Modi government may have started with the fireworks of the schemes, but the compulsion is that similar decisions were expected from them which have now started
 sudhaaron kii koshishen saraahneey hai or samarthan kii darkaar rakhti hai
 But these have to be saved from being symbolic and dull
 sudhaaron ke puraane tajurbe bataate hai ki bahut se kadam sirf ekamusth or samgr na hone ke kaaran ummid par khare nahin utre
 If the fresh efforts of the Modi government are not symbolic and half-done, then in the next two-three-half we will be able to see a new era of economic governance for which the last decade has been wasted

 Hoping for sympathy after the assassination of most of the top leaders of the state Congress in the biggest Naxalite attack in the Jhiram Valley, the Congress gained in the tribal areas, but the defeat in the plains forced it to sit in the opposition for the third consecutive time
 congress ne jin 35 vidhayakon ko dobaaraa mauka diya, unamem se 27 chunaav haar gaye
 Santosh Kumar, India Today's chief correspondent with Congress convenor of the election campaign committee and former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, held special talks with him in Raipur after the results
 pesh hai ansh:sawaal- hetric haar hui congress kii, aapaki najar main kami kahaan rah gai?dekhie ye janadesh he or ham vinamratapurvak ise sweekaar karte hai
 We will review the deficiency where it is sitting in the party
 itnaa ham jarur kahana chahenge ki chhattisgarh main congress aise swaroop main nahin he jaisaa anya pradeshon main hua he
 We will play a strong and constructive opposition with 39 mlas
 sawaal- haar kii badi vajah aapaki najar main?isaki vivechna karenge, lekin ek baat jo sabko dikh rahi he vah he ki hamane jo apane 35 vidhayakon ko ripet kiya or chaar ko nahin mila
 27 of them lost
 is 27 main se 10 bhi jeet jate to sarkaar hamaari banati
 Prima facie this is one of the reasons i believe
 hamaare bade netaaon jinke haar hi ham kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 We had a drastic defeat in the area of our Scheduled Castes
 unamem se 10 main se ham 9 siten haar gaye
 Why Satnami society has turned away from us, it will be known only after reviewing it
 hamaare kuch vidhayakon ne kshetra main acha kaam kiya tha uske baad bhi janata ne nahin sweekaara
 Question- So there was a shortage on ticket distribution? Not saying about ticket distribution, but a principled decision was taken to give tickets to the sitting mlas
 sawaal- tikat bantwaare par aapke or pisisi adhyaksh charan das manhat ke bich khinchataan chal rahi thi
 You had put a board at home that the ticket holders should go to the PCC President, is it the responsibility of the PCC? We have a ticket sharing process, finally the names are released from the lower level under the process, and in a phased manner, finally the Central Election Committee decides is
 sawaal- lekin tikaton ko lekar pisisi adhyaksh or aapke bich takaraav chalata rahaa
 Every leader wants a ticket for whomever he wants
 isliye tikat bantane tak khinchataan rahati he
 But once the ticket is distributed, all the leaders fought together under the leadership of Soniaji and Rahulji
 sawaal- chunaav se pehle charchaa thi ki aap chaahate hai ki chhattisgarh main himachal kaa formula apanaaya jaae or aapako virbhadra singh kii tarah pisisi kii kaman saunpi jaae
 Do you think the party made a mistake in the decision then? party ne jab jaisaa uchit samaj, vaisaa nirnay liya
 Question- You used to say that he gets benefit due to fake voting of ruling party in Bastar, but this time the results of Bastar are in favor of Congress
 dekhie, is baar chunaav ayog ne hamaare kehane par kaaphi achche intjaam kiye
 Videography was conducted, one lakh policemen deployed
 vahaan nishpaksh chunaav hua or jo main pehle kahata tha wo sach sabit hua
 This time if we had fair elections, we won most of the seats and where there are losers, we lost by very small margin
 lekin is baar maidani ilaakon main jarur hamaari paraajay hui
 The main reason for this is that out of the 27 mlas we gave tickets here, only 8 won
 agar chaar or jitate to sarkaar hamaari banati
 Question- Do you consider the results of Chhattisgarh as Modi's victory or Raman Singh's? Modi is not a factor in Chhattisgarh
 modi kii sabase zyada sabhaayen bastar or sarguja main hui or vahaan unka safaya ho gaya
 It is clear that Modi was not a factor
 modi kii sabhaaon main upasthiti 800-1000 hoti thi
 Here the fight was between BJP and Congress
 bijepi adivasee anchal main haari or maidani ilaakon main badhat hasil kii
 Question- Congress focused all its attention on the Bastar region and paid less attention to the rest of the region, is this also a reason? It is true that we used to lose in Bastar, so this time more focus was on this area
 ek-ek vidhansabha main meri chaar-chaar sabhaayen huin
 There were meetings of Bhaktacharan Das
 vahaan rahul ji or sonia ji kii bhi sabhaayen hui
 We had focused in Bastar areas, but in the plain areas such results will come, especially in the 10 seats of SC
 aisa hame purvanumaan nahin tha kyonki us samaaj kaa aarakshan 16 se 12 fisadi kar diya gaya tha or logon main krodh tha
 This needs great metaphysics
 sawaal- aapako nahin lagata he ki ab vakt aa gaya he ki ab chhattisgarh main congress ko puraani peedi ke netaaon se baahar nikalakar nae netaaon ko netritv saunp dena chahie?main aapse sahamat hum
 Now the time has come for the new leadership to be ready and take over its accountability
 khushi kii baat ye he ki is baar vidhansabha main hamaare jo log chunakar aae hai unamem zyaadaatar noujvaan or kam umr vaale hai
 Now that his leadership is developed, those people will now take the reins, it will be good for the Congress
 sawaal- chaar rajyon ke jo nattejey aae hai usase congress virdohi lahar bhi dikh rahi he or khaas taur se dilli jahaan donon mukhya partiyaan bijepi-congress kaa vikalp he, to logon ne nae vikalp ko chunaa
 How do you see? It is true that we have been defeated in all four states
 par do rajyon main bijepi kaa asar nahin dikhaai diya
 The effect of the new party is visible in Delhi and there was no change in the earlier situation of bjp-congress in Chhattisgarh
 iskaa matlab modi factor naam kii cheez kam se kam in do pradeshon main nahin chali
 Doubts have also been raised in the other two states because the regional leadership of Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan and Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh were also strong, they won because of that leadership or because of Modi, it cannot be said with certainty
 
 sawaal- kya chhattisgarh main bhi aap bijepi ke pradeshik netritv ko shashakt maanate hai?chhattisgarh main waisi sthiti nahin hui, jaisi rajasthan-madhya pradesh main hui
 Here we stand at par
 vot fisadi main 1 pratishat kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Question- Now how many seats do you expect the Congress to win in the Lok Sabha from Chhattisgarh? Today it would be wrong to say something
 lekin hamen loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar deni chahie
 Forgetting the past, we should try to get maximum seats in the Lok Sabha
 bijepi ko satta main rahane kaa thodaa phayda milegaa kyonki sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog karnaa unhone 10 saal main sikh liya he, congress aisa nahin kar sakati
 Therefore, the Congress will suffer this loss
 bhartiya janata party kii sahyogi shivasena ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh se pehle congress or trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee par hamalaa bolaa he
 The Shiv Sena has slammed the Congress for not telling the spokespersons to go to any TV debate
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki jis tarah kii dibet hoti hai usase congress ko dar lagata he ki is samay bijepi ke paksh main jo maahaul bana hua he, aise main unhen nuksaan na ho jaae
 Raut further said tightly, Congress seems to have decided that no spokesperson will speak until the government is formed and the House does not run
 congress ke media incharge randeep singh surajevaala ne media channelon or sampadakon se anurodh kiya he ki ve apane sho main congress ke pratinidhiyon ko na bulaaen
 Because the Congress has decided not to send the spokespersons in the TV debate for a month
 sanjay raut congress ke saath-saath mamata banerjee par hamalaa bolne se bhi nahin chuke
 He said, Prime Minister of India is sworn in
 isamen imran khan nahin aa rahe hai kyonki hamane unako nahin bulaayaa he
 He further said, West Bengal is not Bangladesh, it is a part of our country
 piem desh kaa hota he, kisi jati or dharm kaa nahin hota
 It is the duty of the Chief Minister of every state to come to Delhi and meet the Prime Minister
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ham endie ke ghatak dal he
 Uddhav is in Delhi with the Thackeray family, he is going to take oath in the evening
 raut ne kaha ki hamaara ek saansad aaj mantri pad kii shapath le rahaa he
 Which leaders will officially become ministers in the Modi Cabinet has not been disclosed yet
 keval shivasena kii taraf se hi yah baat saamne ai he ki unka ek saansad aaj mantri pad kii shapath le rahaa he
 Significantly, Mamata Banerjee has refused to attend the swearing-in ceremony after the BJP claimed to have killed people in political violence in Bengal

 vipakshi congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue swami ne kaha ki ‘vikiliks’ ke mutabik 2006 main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi america duutavas gaye the or vahaan adhikariyon se kathith taur par kaha tha ki unki party kaa nishkarsh he ki ‘‘hindu aatank’’ lashkar-e-taiyaba se bhi zyada khatarnaak he
 Swami said, "and they overturned the Samjhauta Express (bang)
 jab dhamaakaa hua to manmohan singh sarkaar ne america ko patr likhakar kaha ki aisa lagata he ki ise lashkar-e-taiyaba ne anjaam diya he
 He said that the US, after collecting information from its level, went to the United Nations and declared lashkar-e-taiba as a terrorist organization
 swami ne kaha ki mumbai main 26 / 11 hamale ke baad chidambaram kendriya grih mantri ban gaye, unhone nai praathmiki likhavai
 (in case of Samjhauta Express blast) We had two primaries at the same time
 bhaajapa netaane kaha ki ek praathmiki main kaha gaya ki lashkar-e-taiyaba ne ise anjaam diya or duusari praathmiki ke aadhaar par sena ke adhikari (karnal prasad) purohit , jise islamic aatankwaadiyon par dastavej taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari di gai thi, ko uthaa liya gaya, yatnaa di gai or nau saal tak jail main rakhaa gaya , kyonki ve sabit karnaa chaahate the ki hindu aatankwaadi hota he
 Taking a dig at Chidambaram, Swamy said that he is teaching the senior Congress leader what "real Hindu terror" is
 swami ne kaha, ‘‘ab beshak main chidambaram ko sikhaa rahaa hum ki asal hindu aatank kya hota he
 Surely i will not be cruel, so i will send his wife, his son and daughter-in-law to (jail)
 main congress party ke liye bhi krur nahin banuunga, main kaiyon ko jail bhejuungaa taaki unki kaary samiti kii agali baithak tihaad jail main ho sake
 On the economic situation of the country, Swami, an economist and statistician said, "the economy is definitely not in a very good state, because i am not a finance minister
" ’’kai tarah ke up-kar (ses) khatm karne kii vakaalat karte hue bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki sirf ek up-kar kii jarurat he or log jiske liye khushi-khushi bhugtan karenge, vah gaushalaon ke liye he
 He said, "I am sure that people will be happy to pay such cess

 haalanki blueberi yugers hameshaa vyast rahete hai
 Unlike iphone users, they send more messages and emails and also make more calls
 adhyayan se yah bhi pataa chalaa ki blueberi rakhane vaale yugers ke relationships zyada lambey samay tak chalate hai
 Not only this, they are social and their friends are also more
 vahiin, android yugers ausatan ek hafte main yphone or blueberi yugers kii tulana main zyada tivi dekhte hai or sharaab pite hai
 Blackberry users drink more tea coffee and their diet is also good
 blueberi yugers khud ko tej-tarraar or bubbly nechar kaa maanate hai or ye zyaadaatar health, finans or property sector main kaam karte hai, jabaki yphone yugers khud ko deiring, flert karne vaala or aakarshak maanate hai

 com / n0odvmrcsk Both were dropped due to lack of evidence to substantiate the allegations against Indian Olympic Association (IOA) general secretary Rajiv Mehta and wrestling referee Virender Malik who were arrested on various charges
 bhartiya ucchayog ke adhikariyon ke mutabik donon adhikariyon ke khilaaf aarope waapas le liye gaye hai or yah maamla sheriff adaalat main sunwaayee ke liye nahin aayaa
 The decision to leave these two officials has brought a lot of relief for the Indian contingent, which suffered a very embarrassing situation on the last day of the 20th Commonwealth Games due to this episode
 mehta ko kathith taur par sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha jabaki malik par yon utpeedan kaa gambhir aarope laga tha
 Malik was not part of the Indian contingent
 ye donon haalanki bharat ke 215 sadasyeey dal ke saath khel gaanv main nahin rah rahe the
 The two reportedly stayed at a local hotel
 ucchayog ke adhikariyon ne bataaya, 'saakshyon ke abhaav main in donon ke khilaaf aarope hataa die gaye hai
 He was released without framing any charges
 ' edinburgh main bhartiya vaanijya duutavas is maamle main police ke sampark main tha
 Uttar Pradesh Olympic Association secretary Anandeshwar Pandey, who was in the IOA delegation present in the court, said that the officials were released after a preliminary inquiry
 pandey ne kaha, 'praathmik jaanch main unhen (scotland yard police) aarope tay karne ke liye paryaapt sakshya nahin mili
 So he was released without being produced in court
 ' Giving more details about the incident, Pandey said that Mehta was driving his friend's car and a small accident occurred while coming out of the parking lot
 arthshaastra ke professor bhale hi is vishay ko takneekee or jatil banane kii tamaam koshish karte hon, lekin vastav main yah behad aasaan he
 In applying economic principles, the role of politics and human psychology is important rather than complexities
 bharat kii vartmaan aarthik samasyaon par vichaar karne se pehle is prishthbhumi ko samajhnaa behad jaruri he
 Why has India's growth rate again reached the level of the late 90s, ie 6-7% per annum? On the economic front, this country has not been able to follow the advice of Indian and foreign experts
 yah mulk in salahon par kadam uthaane main kyon pichad rahaa he? agar in baton par amal kar liya jaae to salanaa vikaas ke maamle main bharat china ko pachhadkar ubharate hue mulkon kaa aarthik sartaaj ban saktaa he
 The only economic indicator is the answer to these questions and this is inflation
 mudrasphiti kii oonchi dar corporate nivesh ke aade aati he or isse pariwaron ke kharch karne kii kshamta ghatati he
 In fact, raising the interest rates of the Reserve Bank of India to increase the cost of corporate funds also creates the possibility of increasing inflation in the future
 agar bharat kii mudrasphiti dar 15 fisadi se aage jane kii disha main badhati he (jaisaa kaarobaari saal 2009-10 main dekhne ko mila tha) to yah mulk kabhi bhi dahaai vikaas dar kaa lakshya hasil nahin kar paaegaa
 However, you can say that it is influenced by external factors
 is dauraan china samet kai mulk oonchi mudrasphiti kii samasya se jujh rahe the
 These things are true, but consider China's inflation: China's inflation was only slightly above 6 percent and now it has reached below 4 percent
 duusari taraf, bharat sochataa he ki isaki mudrasphiti dar 8 fisadi se neeche pahunch chuki he or iske maddenjar maudrik niti main dheel die jane ke liye arabiai par chautarafa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 a look at the inflation data means that the Indian economy lags behind China in terms of liberalization and flexibility
 bharat main mudrasphiti isliye zyada he, kyonki rajnatik vajahon se bhartiya rigerv bank jald se jald thos kadam uthaane main sakasham nahin he
 Also, the supply side of the Indian economy is quite strict
 saidhantik nazariye se lacheelee arthvyavastha main oonchi keemton se supplai main ijapha hona chahie, bhartiya arthvyavastha is category main nahin shaamil he
 Why is the Indian economy not flexible? The government has laid down its arms on the issue of liberalization and opening up of the market
 aarthik sudhaaron se jude niyam, tex system main sudhaar or baaki baadhaaen bharat ko aakarshak bazaar banane main baadhak hai or in marjon ke ilaaj kii jarurat he or inhen jald dur kiya janaa chahie
 The ongoing political pulls on the retail issue better illustrate this problem
 koi ek akelaa udaarikaran sabhi chizon kaa ilaaj nahin hoga
 However, the reduction in prices, encouraging investment in infrastructure and accelerating the work being done to increase the income of rural India will be beneficial for the demand side
 raajnneeti or bhrashtachar ne in chizon ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya he or aakhirkaar kanoon ne mobile telecom license kii dhajjiyaan uda deen
 Under the headless decision, the first cotton export was banned and the ban was lifted after a few days
 agar aap ek company hote (bhartiya yaa videshi koi bhi) to kya aise mulk main nivesh karnaa chaahate jahaan rajnatik, nitigat masalon or mudrasphiti par baari anischitata kaa alam ho
 Obviously not at all, unless the basic changes in this environment are made

 The Prime Minister had said, "if i owe the most to one country for one tax reform, i give credit to the states
 'unhone kaha tha, 'jiesti sahakaari sanghavaad kaa ek behtareen udhaaharan he, jahaan sabhi rajyon ne milakar deshhit main faisla liya or tab jaakar desh main itnaa bada kar sudhaar lagu ho sakaa
 Modi has also mentioned Doctor's Day and Chartered Accountants' Day in three separate tweets
 unhone likhaa he, 'unka pesha maanvon main sabase sabhy or paavan he
 It is heartening to see that Indian doctors are proving themselves better around the world and working out-of-the-box in the fields of research and innovation
 ' chartered acountents (sie) ke liye modi ne likhaa he, 'desh ke nirmaan main sie samudaay kii bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 We hope that the CA community will continue to contribute to the development of the country

 vahiin, 349 rupee vaale plan main ab pratidin 2
