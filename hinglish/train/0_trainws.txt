 Uttarakhand is also known as the state with the most folk festivals in the country
 inhen main se ek he harela
 The special thing is that where any festival comes once a year, it is not so with Harela
 devbhumise jude kuch logon ke yahaan ye parv caitra, shravan or asadha ke shuru hone par yani varsh main teen baar manaaya jaataa he, to kahin ek baar
 The most important of these is the green festival on the first day of Shravan, because it is drenched with the greenery of the spring
 17 july ko manaaya jayega harelis baar yah parv 17 july ko hoga, jise samooche uttrakhand ke vaasi manaayenge, chaahe vah devbhumi main nivas karte hon, yaa phir kahin or rahete hon
 With this, the month of Kavavan will also begin from July 17, while in other parts of the country, the month of Savan will be considered after that
 ek hi maah kii alag-alag tithiyon main shuruyaat bhi desh kii dharmik ritiyon kii vividhta ko darshata he
 Actually, the festival of Harela marks the beginning of a new season
 vahiin sawan maas ke harele kaa mahatv uttrakhand main isliye behad mahatv he, kyonki dev bhoomi ko devon ke dev mahadev kaa vaas bhi kaha jaataa he
 Dev Bhoomi is the home of Lord Shankar, Jyotishacharya Ganesh Dutt Tripathi told IPN that Lord Shankar's house in Devbhoomi is both Himalayas and in-laws Haridwar, because of his special pooja and in such a situation, the idols of this day family come when the harela of the month of Savan comes
 Are also carved, called decares
 shuddh mitti kii akritiyon ko prakritik rangon se shiv-parivaar kii pratimaaon kaa aakaar diya jaataa he or is din unki puja kii jaati he
 Harela is made of Hariyali
 Generally the word Harela is derived from Hariyali
 harele ke parv se nau din pehle ghar ke bheetar sthit mandir main yaa gram ke mandir ke bheetar saat prakaar ke ann (jau, gehun, makka, gahat, sarson, urad or bhatta) ko ringaal kii tokari main ropit kar diya jaataa he
 a special process is followed for this, first a layer of soil is laid in the basket of the ringle, then seeds are added to it
 uske baadaphir se mitti daali jaati he, phir se beej daale jate hai, yahi prakriya paanch-chah baar apanaai jaati he
 On the tenth day, Harela is battered, it is protected from direct sunlight and watered every day in the morning
 nawein din inaki ek sthaneey vriksh kii tahani se gudayi kii jaati he or dasven yani kihrele ke dinise kaata jaataa he
 After cutting, it is invoked by the house owner with tilak-chandan-akshat, which is called Harela Patisana
 uske baad ise devtaa ko arpit kiya jaataa he
 After this, the elderly women of the house beat all the members
 harela lagane kaa tarika yah he ki harela sabase pehle pairo, phir ghutane, phir kandhe or ant main sir main rakhaa jaataa he or aashirwad swarup yah panktiyaan, 'ji raye, jaagi raye
 
 dharti jas agav, akaash jas chaakav he jaaye
 
 surj jas taraan, syave jasi buddhi ho
 
 doob jas faliye, sil pisi bhaat khaaye, janthi teki jhaad jaye' kahin jaati hai
 Elder people give Duanajyotishacharya Ganesh Dutt Tripathi told IPN that this means that greenery should meet you, stay alive, be aware, be patient like the earth, be like the sky (be generous), be like the sun, like the jackal Ho, thrive like the trunks of Durva, so long that (toothless) you have to grind rice and eat sticks and use sticks to defecate
 badabujargo kii ye duaenchhoton ke jivan main khushhaali or samruddhi kaa pratik banati hai
 The importance of Harelay can also be understood from the fact that if a member of the family is not present in the house on the day of festival, then Harela is kept for him and whenever he reaches home, the elders worship him
 
 vahiin kai parivaar ise apane ghar ke doordaraj ke sadasyon ko dak dwaara bhi pahunchaate hai
 Harela gives the message of being united
 Another special thing is that until a family is divided, Harela is sown in the same place, even if the family members live in different places
 parivaar ke vibhaajan ke baad hi sadsy alag harela bo or kaat sakate hai
 In this way even today, this festival has kept many families united

 HD Kumaraswamy government has a strength test in Karnataka today i
e
 Thursday
 congress or jedies sarkaar par sankat kaa ye badal 16 vidhayakon ke baghawat se mandara rahaa he, haalanki ek baagi vidhayak ne sarkaar ke paksh main vot karne kaa elaan kiya he, jabaki baaki baagi vidhayakon kaa daawa he ki unhen bijepi ne sai baba kii kasam dilaai he
 Meanwhile, the last attempt to save the Kumaraswamy government is also going on
 mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ke kareebi emelsi bm faruk ne apane khaas shahid ko mumbai bheja he
 Shahid went to a hotel in Mumbai to meet rebel mlas of JDS and Ramesh Jarkiholi
 haalanki, is mulaakaat ke baad baagi vidhayakon kaa kya rukh he, ye nahin abhi saaf nahin he
 Earlier, the Supreme Court in its judgment on Wednesday gave a big blow to the Kumaraswamy government by saying that whip will not be applied to rebel mlas
 haalanki, supreme court ne spikar ramesh kumaar ko adhikaar diya ki vah vidhayakon ke istife par faisla len
 Meanwhile, all eyes are also on the speaker's decision
 in 15 baagi vidhayakon kii kismat kaa hoga faislagin 15 vidhayakon ne spikar ko apana istipha saunpa he, usamen congress-jedies ke ech vishwanath, aar roshan beg, ramesh jharkholi, anand singh, es tii somshekhar, bairathi basavaraj, en muniratn, bi si patil, pratap gauda patil, shivaram hebbar, mahesh kumtahalli, em tii bi nagaraj, ke sudhakar, narayan gauda, ke gopalaiya shaamil he
 However, Congress rebel Ramalinga Reddy has announced to vote in favor of the government
 119 vidhayakon ke samarthan se bani thi kumaraswami sarkaarkarnataka ke siem kumaraswami bahumat sabit kar paaenge yaa nahin, ise jaanane ke liye karnataka ke number game ko samajhnaa hoga
 In the 224-member assembly, Kumaraswamy had the support of 119 mlas, including the Speaker, including 79 from Congress, 37 from JDS, one from BSP and 2 Independents
 jabaki bijepi ke paas 105 vidhayakon kii takat thi
 After the rebellion, the Kumaraswamy government, in a minority, has now come down from 119 to 101, while BJP has 107 mlas after the rebellion of 16 mlas and two independents into the BJP camp
 yani, 16 baagi vidhayak aaj vishwaas mat main shaamil nahin hue to sadan main sirf 208 vidhayak rah jaaenge
 a majority of 105 mlas will be needed, but Kumaraswamy will lose the confidence vote by having only 101 mlas
 sarkaar ke khilaaf baagi vidhayak kar sakate hai votevishwaas mat ke dauraan aaj ek or paristhiti ubhar sakati he
 If 16 rebel mlas vote against the government, then only 101 votes will be cast in favor of the government while 123 will go against it
 yani tab bhi kumaraswami sarkaar kii paraajay hogi

 While the general public is happy over the Supreme Court's decision to stop tainted leaders from the pleasure of power, the same Samajwadi Party is slowly coming forward to openly oppose it

 mana ja rahaa he ki paanch agast se shuru ho rahe sansad ke monsoon satr main is mudde par kaaphi gahamgahami rahegi
 SP General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav believes that the court's decision on tainted leaders has many flaws and it should be discussed in Parliament
 jabaki kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari kaa maananaa he ki har mudde par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 While Finance Minister Chidambaram says that the government is discussing the legal aspects of the court's decision on tainted leaders
 kuch din pehle bhi saansad or mahasachiv naresh agarwal ne aaj tak se khaas vaatcheet main kaha ki ye loktantric faisla nahin he
 In this case, a reconsideration petition should be filed or else all parties should know the opinion by calling an all-party meeting

 This can also be discussed with the BJP
 Union Minister Ramdas Athawale: i had talked to Sanjay Raut ji about a compromise

 This is the story of two orphaned brothers 'buddy' (christopher) and Jacob (anton Elchin), who live near the us-mexico border, who are in love but have differences due to drug war
 bady local mafia julius ke saath mil jaataa he or cinema theatre ke bahaane paison ke gorakhdhandhe kaa bijness karne lagata he
 Then the gang war starts, a lot of blood is broken
 jaikab apane bhai bady ko saath lejaakar neuyork shift hona chahta he or ye baat bady ke mafia bos julius ko nagawara hoti he
 Then the mafia wants to take advantage of the fight between the brothers and in the last the victory is true
 film kii script paravidhu vinodchopra or abhijaat ne kaam karne ke saath-saath dialogs bhi saral rakhe hai jisaki vajah se film dekhte vakt jatilta najar nahin aati
 The plot of the film is of the film 'parinda' but an attempt has been made to revive the treatment and that is why this film does not attract that much even if it is a Hollywood star
 hollywood film main jab bollywood kaa tadakaa lagata he to hamaari ummid duguni ho jaati he, lekin yah film aapako vahi puraani film 'parinda' ko angreji main pesh karti he
 In English films too much emotion is not successful and if you look at the film, you definitely see the sentiment of Vidhu Vinod Chopra saheb
 hollywood main ise ek acha prayaas kaha ja saktaa he
 We sincerely hope that after this the makers of films like '3 Idiots' and 'PK' and the next film will bring better

 The son of a North Korean refugee and reformist leader Moon will first begin talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un after assuming power
 bataa den ki purv raashtrapati park goon he ne uttar korea se saare rishte khatm kar liye the
 At the same time, North Korea was banned completely
 march main park goon-he ko bhrashtachar ke aarope main barkhaast kar diya gaya tha, jiske baad moon jaae-in kii jeet saamne ai he

 In the Hindi film world, people may not be familiar with the name of Kumud Kumar Ganguly, but cinematographers and cine lovers are well acquainted with the names of Ashok Kumar and Dada Muni

 Monday, October 13 is the birthday of beloved grandfather Muni
 unka janm 13 oktober 1911 ko bihar ke bhagalpur main ek madhyam vargeey bengali parivaar main hua tha
 Ashok Kumar, the elder son of lawyer Kunjlal Ganguly by profession, later became an inspiration for his younger brothers Anoop Kumar and Kishore Kumar to make a career in the film world
 chalati kaa naam gadimashhoor plabac singer kishor kumaar ne to apane kai intervyuu main bhi yah sweekaar kiya tha ki unhen na keval abhinay, balki singing kii prerana bhi bade bhai se mili thi, kyonki ashok bachapan se hi unke bheetar baalageeton ke jariye gayan ke sanskaar daalate aae the
 The three brothers also worked together in the film 'chalti Ka Naam Gaadi' which was a superhit
 ashok kumaar vaise to shuru se hi film kshetra main aana chaahate the, lekin vah actor nahin balki ek kaamyaab film diarector bananaa chaahate the
 In 1934, Ashok Kumar started working as a laboratory assistant in New Theater in Mumbai
 baad main unke bahanoi or dost shashidhar mukherjee ne unhen apane paas bombai tokies studio main kaam karne ke liye bulavaa liya tha
 After the hero became ill, 'jeevan Naiya', Ashok Kumar's foray into acting was nothing short of a film story
 1936 main bombai tokies studio kii film ‘jivan naiya’ ke nayak najm ul hasan achaanak biimaar pad gaye or company sankat main pad gai
 Studio owner Himanshu Rai then turned his attention to the lucrative laboratory assistant Ashok Kumar and offered him the role of a hero in the film
 yaheen se ashok kumaar kaa abhinay safar shuru hua
 As an actor, Ashok Kumar developed his natural style, bypassing the prevalent styles of acting
 vah acting main prayog karne or jokhim lene se kabhi ghabaraae nahin or pehali baar hindi cinema main anti hero kirdaar kaa chalan bhi unhone hi shuru kiya tha
 After Jeevan Naiya, his next film was 'untouchable Girl'
 1937 main pradarshit 'achhut kanya' behad kaamyaab rahi
 This film made Ashok Kumar in the category of big stars of Hindi film industry
 madhubala or lata mangeshkar ko bulandiyon par pahunchayaage chalakar bombai tokies ke binar tale bataur production chif ashok kumaar ne 'mashaal', 'ziddee' or 'majaboor' jaisi kai filmein banaain
 At the same time, he produced the superhit film 'mahal' released in 1949, which brought the playback singer Lata Mangeshkar along with actress Madhubala to fame
 ashok kumaar kaa manoranjan jagat main yogadan sirf bade parde tak hi simit nahin rahaa
 In 1984, he appeared in the first show opera 'humalog' of Doordarshan's history in the role of serial, and for Doordarshan, he also acted in serials like 'bhimbhavani', 'bahadur Shah Zafar' and 'ujale Ki Oar'

 Recently, a news from social media created a lot of buzz, in which a husband prepared a note about the relationship with his wife
 us note main usne 7 hafton main un palon kii ginati kii thi, jab vah apni patni ke behad kareeb aayaa tha or donon ne prem ke paravaan ko mahasoos kiya tha
 The man expressed his displeasure that his wife turned down 27 offers to have a physical relationship with him and was deeply saddened
 samay ke saath vaivaahik jivan kii yah ek aisi samasya he jo der-saver har danpati ke saamne aati he

 If this is the case then instead of remaining silent, you need to talk to each other
 aap chahen to bedroom ke baar bhi apane partner se is ore baat kar sakate hai
 Never mention to your partner after or before making a physical relationship that this is the need, so you are doing it
 balki unhen pyaar kaa ehsaas hone den
 Tell them that you love them and want to hand over everything to them
 pasand naapsand kaa zikrasambandh banane ke kram main sabase jaruri he ki aap ek-duusare kii pasand-naapsand ko samajhe, jaane or us par baat karen
 Your partner may not necessarily like the posture that you like
 samajhane kii koshish karen ki aapkaa saathi kab or kis tarah adhik anand mahasoos karata he
 Talk openly on these issues
 thodaa halke main lendin bhar kii thakaan yaa chintaaon ko dur bhagane ke liye sex se behatar koi dawa yaa vyaayaam nahin he
 So don't take it so seriously
 thodaa lite mood banaae rakhen
 Think of something new every day
 kuch rochak or kuch aisa jo aapako or aapke saathi donon ko anand de
 Never compare your partner with anyone
 agar vah kuch nayaa kar rahaa he yaa rahi he to use samajhe
 If you are not experiencing bliss then add something from your side in appreciation of his effort
 pyaar karnaa or pyaar ko banaae rakhana koi rocket science nahin he
 The need is just to understand each other

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne england ke khilaaf yahaan sapaat pich par drow chute pehle test cricket match main apane gendbaajon ke pradarshan kii jamkar tarif kii
 India scored 457 runs in the first innings and declared the second innings ended by scoring 391 runs for nine wickets
 england ne apni ekmaatr pari main 496 ran banaae
 Dhoni said, we cannot control the pitch
 hamane vah kiya jo ham kar sakate the or is match main hamaare liye kaaphi sakaaratmak pahalu rahe
 He said, the bowlers performed very well on such a pitch
 yahaan tak ki 160 over karne par bhi unhone kaaphi prayaas kiye
 They each took around 25 to 30 to 35 overs and still did not let themselves get tired
 dhoni ne kaha, kul milakar hamaari ballebaaji acchhee dikh rahi he
 Murali Vijay performed well and others performed well
 kuch ballebaaj apane kariyar main shandaar shuruyaat karte hai or kuch samay lagaate hai
 It is not always linked to the result
 yadi aap pichley kuch dauron ko dekho to phir hamaare ballebaajon main kaaphi sudhaar aayaa he
 The pitch remained the subject of discussion during the match and this did not help the bowlers
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ne do ardhashatak jamaaye jabaki stuart binni, mohammad shami or james anderson ne pehali baar ardhashatak puraa karne main safal rahe
 Anderson also shared a 198-run partnership for the last wicket with Joe Root
 unhone kaha, dakshin africa main aap tej wicket par khelnaa chaahate ho or acha pradarshan karte ho
 In England, you want pitches and conditions that suit swing bowling
 ummid he ki aage ke maichon main wicket adhik jeevant honge
 Binny scored a half-century in his first Test match to get India out of the crisis
 unhone ravindra jadeja or bhubaneshwar ke saath do ardhashtakeey saajhedaariyaan bhi kin
 Dhoni said, the partnership between Binny and Ravindra Jadeja was very important
 tab aadhe din kaa khel bachaa hua tha or hamane paryaapt ran nahin banaae the
 At that time we were struggling
 tab ham chaah rahe the ki ve acchhee ballebaaji karen or unhone aisa kiya
 Most of our players do not have experience of batting under pressure and saving matches, so this match was a good experience for them
 binni kii bhoomika ke bare main unhone kaha, binni kii bhoomika prabhavit rahi, kyonki wicket unki gendbaaji style ke anukool nahin tha
 Jadeja was bowling on a flat pitch so i decided not to give Binny more overs
 dhoni ne kaha, ham videshon main paanch gendbaajon ke saath nahin khelte hai, lekin purv main aise main hamaari gendbaaji ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 So if we have to play with five bowlers, be it Binny or r Ashwin, then the batsmen will have to take more responsibility

 This is an example of how a man, realizing his plan, wrote the story of the success of a public sector undertaking through hard work
 kya apane parmaanu hathiyaaron ko lekar ham mugalate main hai? kya bharat ke parmaanu hathiyaar utane kargar nahin jitna kii ham maanate rahe hai yaa jitna ki sarkaar ne daawa kiya he? pokharanmen duusare parmaanu pareekshansejude ekavaigyanik ne yah kah kar sabkochaunkaa diya he kihydrogen bam kaa pareekshan puri tarah kaamyaab nahin hua tha
 On May 13, 1998, a nuclear power-rich India stirred the entire world in Pokhran under a stir
 duniya abhi is dhamaake kii takat kaa andaja lagane main hi juty thi ki pokharan kii dharti ek baar phir hili
 India conducted two more nuclear tests
 pehle parmaanu pareekshan ke 24 saalon ke baad hue in paanch dhamaakon ne bharat ko duniya ke un chuninda deshon kii qatari nen laa khadaa kiya jinke paas parmaanu bam kii kargar or bharosemand takanic he
 At least this is what the government claimed
 lekin ye sirf aadha sach he
 This is only one aspect of reality
 doosraa pahalu wo he jo is parmaanu pareekshan se behad kareeb se jude rahe vaigyanik ke santhanum kah rahe hai
 After Operation Shakti, the government claimed that India had acquired the full technology of the atomic bomb for this test 
 or na sirf newcleear fijan bam balki usase kai guna taqatvar fusion bam yani hydrogen bam banane kaa formula bhi aajamaa liya he
 India has only the technology of conventional atomic bombs but after 11 years of Pokharan-2, the claim of the Santhanam of nuclear scientist is enough to break this quandary of us
 ke santhanum ke mutabik bharat ke paas sirf newcleear fijan bam yani paramparaagat parmaanu bam kii hi takanic he
 We do not have the reliable technology of fusion bombs
 santhanum kaa daawa he ki pokharan-2 main jis thermonucleear divaais ko test kiya gaya tha wo ummiido par khara nahin utraa
 It is not possible to ignore Santhanam's claim as Santhanam was the Coordinator of India's second round of nuclear tests ie Pokharan-2 and if Santhanam is to be believed, India still lags far behind the rest of the nuclear weapon states
 chaaro taraf se khataron se ghira he bharatbharat chaaro taraf se parmaanu hathiyaaron se las padosiyon se ghira hua he
 In such a situation, Santhanam's shocking revelation is also connected with the question whether India's nuclear weapons are inferior to Pakistan
 kyonki ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin kipakistan kaa parmaanu hathiyaar asal main puri tarah china kii nakal he
 India has fought with both China and Pakistan
 India has fought wars with both China and Pakistan in the past
 pakistan ke saath bharat kaa rishta jagajaahir he or china lagaataar dhauns jamaane kii koshish karata rahaa he
 In such a situation, the news of India not having effective nuclear weapons technology is such that it cannot be dismissed
 china ko maharath hasilchin ne newcleear fijan bam ke saath saath fusion yani hydrogen bam banane main bhi maharath hasil kar rakhi he or visheshgyon ke mutabik china kii madad se pakistan bhi hydrogen bam kii takanic kaa pareekshan kar chukaa he
 There are many major shortcomings in India's nuclear program
 If we believe the Santhanam of scientist associated with Pokharan-2 nuclear program of India, then there are still many major shortcomings in our nuclear program
 or jarurat ise or dhardaar banane kii he
 According to k Santhanam, the technique of hydrogen bomb is not such that one can achieve greatness in one test
 aise main thermonucleear divaais ke or pareekshan kii jarurat he
 k Santhanam, who is associated with India's Pokharan-2 nuclear mission, believes that the technology of nuclear fusion bombs can be considered effective only if the seismic devices present in the world testify to this
 or pehle pareekshan main bharat kamobesh naakaam ho chukaa he
 But it is worth noting that India has announced not to conduct further nuclear tests
 aise main hamaari parmaanu taiyaariyon ko lekar andeh bana rahegaa

 Deputy Superintendent Gideon Zubrin said that both suicide bombers were also killed in the attack
 bhartiya team bhale hi newjiland ke khilaaf gendbaajon ke lagaataar lachar pradarshan se chintit ho lekin iske baavjood 20 november se shuru hone vaale tisare or antim test match main uske paanch gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii sambhaavna nahin he kyonki ballebaaji kram main saatven number par aane vaale captain mahendra singh dhoni antim ekadash main hameshaa chah visheshgy ballebaaj rakhana pasand karte hai
 Ever since Dhoni has taken over the captaincy, India have not landed with five bowlers in any match
 ab jahir khan ke chotil hone se bhartiya gendbaaji adhik kamjor dikh rahi he lekin puri sambhaavna he ki bharat do tej gendbaaj or do spinneron ke saath maidan par utrega
 Former captain Ravi Shastri, however, believes that India should go with five bowlers as Harbhajan Singh is batting well
 unhone haal main kaha tha, ‘jahir khan anfit he isliye bharat ko srisanth, ishanth sharma, harbhajan singh, amit mishra or pragyan ojha ko team main rakhana chahie
 Dhoni, however, does not agree as he believes India feels more comfortable playing with four bowlers
 unhone hyderabad main duusare test match ke baad kaha tha, ‘yah vikalp ho saktaa he lekin ham adhiktar chaar gendbaajon ke saath hi utarate hai
 Dhoni has captained India in 20 matches so far but in none of these matches, India have landed with five bowlers
 asal main pichley do saal main bhartiya team ne antim ekadash main kabhi paanch gendbaaj nahin rakhe
 The Indian team had five bowlers in the form of Sreesanth, Irfan Pathan, RP Singh, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh but South Africa had hit 494 for seven wickets
 duusari taraf bharat ko ek ballebaaj kii kami akhri or uski team 76 or 328 ran hi bana paayi thi
 Earlier in January 2008, India also landed in Adelaide against Australia with five bowlers but then Irfan Pathan played the role of opener
 austrailia ne tab 563 ran banaaye the or yah match dra ho gaya tha
 India had four bowlers in all matches within the last two years
 inamen se adhiktar match main jahir or ishanth team kaa hissaa rahe
 Meanwhile, among the fast bowlers, Munaf Patel, s Sreesanth and Abhimanya Mithun, in the spinners apart from Harbhajan, Pragyan Ojha and Amit Mishra also played some matches
 dhoni ko haalanki tej gendbaaji main jahir ke saath ishanth yaa srisanth tathaa spinneron main harbhajan ke saath ojha hi adhik pasand aaye
 Harbhajan and Ojha together have handled the Indian spin attack in nine matches
 nagpur main jahir kii anupasthiti main srisanth or ishanth gendbaaji kaa aagaaj kar sakate he
 However, young fast bowler Jaydev Unadkat has also been included in the team
 jabardast form main chal rahe team india ke captain viraat kohli ne ek baar phir south africa gendbaajon ko majaa chakhaaya
 He not only scored the 34th ODI century of his career in Cape Town, but also left behind Sachin Tendulkar by playing an unbeaten 160-run innings on African soil
 darasal, viraat south africa main sabase badi vanade pari khilne vaale bhartiya ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Earlier this record was in the name of Sachin, who scored 152 runs in 2003 against Namibia
 viraat ne 159 gendon kii pari ke dauraan 12 chauke or do chakke lagaae, jisaki badaulat team india ne 303 / 6 ranon kaa bada score khadaa kiya

 unhone apane is record ko or pukhta kiya
 In this case, Virat has left behind Rahul Dravid, Quinton de Kock, Rohit Sharma, who has a record of achieving this feat 4-4 times
 viraat is dwipaksheeya siries main do shatko ke saath (112, 46*, 160*) 318 ran bana chuke hai
 Virat Karanama: 300+ runs in ODI bilateral series 6 times - Virat Kohli 4 times - Rahul Dravid 4 times - Quinton de Cock 4 times - Rohit Sharma FACTS - Virat's unbeaten 160 runs is his biggest individual innings while batting first in odis
 isse pehle unhone 2015 main chennai main south africa ke khilaaf 138 ran banaae the
 - Virat played 159 balls in his century, which is the highest in his ODI career
 isse pehle unhone 2012 main pakistan ke khilaaf dhaka main148 genden kheli thim or 183 ran banaae the
 Virat's 160 * runs as captain on foreign soil is the biggest innings after Kapil Dev
 kapil ne 1983 world cap ke dauraan tanbrij wales main zimbabwe ke khilaaf naabad 175 ranon kii chamatkaari pari kheli thi
 Virat Kohli has scored 12th ODI century as captain, now only Ricky Ponting and AB de Villiers are ahead of him, who have 22 and 13 centuries respectively
 vanade captain : sarvaadhik shatak22 riki ponting (220 paariyaan)13 abi divilliars (98 paariyaan)12 viraat kohli(43 paariyaan)11 saurav gangli (143 paariyaan) Newly appointed president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Nitin Gadkari, says that LK Advani will continue to play the role of a pioneer and thinker for the party while remaining the President of the BJP Parliamentary Party
 gadakari ne main kaha ki atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani hamaare preranarot hai
 Advani will continue to play the role of a permanent pioneer and thinker of the party
 unase poocha gaya tha ki adwani ko bhaajapa sansadeey dal ke adhyaksh ke pad par niyukt kiye jane ke baad kya unki bhoomika bhaajapa ke sansadeey maamalon tak hi simit rahegi
 Advani relinquished the post of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha on 18 December
 aam chunaav main party ke chintajanak pradarshan ke baad party ke bheetar se hi ho rahe hamalon ke baad unhone aisa kiya tha
 After this he was made the president of the party parliamentary party, which seemed to have limited his role there
 rashtriya raajnneetik patal par pehali baar ubharkar aae gadakari ise alaabhakaari nahin maanate balki unka mat he ki yah pad milanaa unke liye bahumoolya hoga or vah kabhi purvaagrah grast nahin honge
 Gadkari's appointment on December 18 came at a time when the party is believed to be going through a very bad phase and felt the need for some concrete measures to revive it

 yahi nahin, SFS kaa bhi daawa he ki sikh geoup main aakar unke protest sammelan main bhaashan dekar jane vaali mahila seemaa aaazaad hi thi
 However, it was the effort of the University administration and the Chandigarh Police that Seema Azad not be able to come to this program and give a speech, because the law and order situation of the university was expected to deteriorate due to this
 lekin philhal SFS kaa daawa he ki tamaam suraksha or ABVP kii gundgardee ke baavjood seemaa aaazaad unke sammelan main shaamil hui hai
 But all this happened in such a silent manner that no one is able to give official confirmation of this matter
 isse pehle punjab uniwarsity prashasan kii taraf se parmishan naa milane ke baavjood park main SFS kii taraf se bulaae gaye sammelan ko lekar campus main tanaav kii sthiti shuukravaar subah se hi bani rahi

 haal ye he ki bhingne se bachane ke liye driver ko kabhi ingine ke bheetar chhatari lagaani padati he, to kabhi renkot tak pahananaa padataa he
 According to the driver, due to such conditions, not only his life but also the lives of the passengers are at risk
 driver ne bataaya ki kai baar wo trainon ke ingine kii khasta haalat ke bare main jaankaree ucch adhikariyon ko de chuke hai, lekin na to shishe se pani kaa bheetar aana band hua or na hi ingine kii chhaton kaa tapaknaa

 a post shared by Nihaar Pandya (@nihaarpandya) on Jun 21, 2018 at 10:09am pdtkapila sharma ke sho ke dauraan jab kapil ne poocha ki aapane pehali baar kaise prapoj kiya tha to nihaar ne kaha, ''ham apane farmahouse ke aasapaas tahal rahe the or ek ped ke neeche pehle se tay jagah par pahunchaa or phir main ek pair ke ghutane par baith gaya
 After this i asked, 'will you marry me?' Nihar told that during this time there was also a rain of flowers
 nihaar ne apane instagram acount par kai baar niti ke saath photo or video bhi share kar chuke hai
 On January 3, 1969, Balasaheb Thackeray met the then Sarsanghchalak Guru Golwalkar and Sarkaryavah Deoras in Nagpur
 haalanki bala sahib bombai se gaye to the nagpur viapeeth main vidhyaarthee sangh ke sammelan main bhaashan dene, lekin sipiem ne dhamkee di thi ki thakare nagpur se jinda nahin laut paaenge, isliye sangh harakat main aayaa or thakare kii suraksha ke liye mahal ke toun haul main ek hajaar swayamsevak darshak banakar baith gaye
 That speech, including Pramod Navalkar, Sudhir Joshi and Manohar Joshi, became the bodyguards of 12 Shiv Sena Thackeray
 toun haul ke us bhaashan main thakare ne jis andaaj main marathi maanush se lekar ngkshahadu rashtrawaad kaa zikr kiya, uske baad aresas ko kabhi laga hi nahin ki bala sahib sangh ke swayamsevak nahin hai
 Then, in the last 45 years, the color of both the politics has become so thick that no one thought that the saffron glory in friendship will ever be divided into enmity
 ab yahi dushmani maharashtra main satta kaa sameekaran bana-bigaad rahi he
 Even today, in the Sangh, the question of lakhs rests is whether the BJP can take power on its own or form a government with the Shiv Sena after the elections
 uski duvidha yah he ki uske swayamsevak agar bijepi ke liye sakriy hote hai to sangh kii shakhaaen bhi shivasena ke nishane par aa sakati hai
 This is why volunteers are trying to fill the zeal for votes among Hindu voters, but are avoiding direct reference to vote for BJP
 is lihaaj se maharashtra chunaav narendra modi-amit shah kii jodi ke liye aisa acid test he jisamen shivasena ko lekar sangh ke ngkshahadutv kii saakh daanv par he
 Uddhav Thackeray is understanding this fine politics and Modi too
 isiilie uddhav ngkshahadutv kaa raag alaap rahe hai to modi vikaas kaa naaraa laga rahain
 Shiv Sena and BJP are ready to put a sword on any one issue, then it is Shivaji's legacy
 isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki yah sangharsh maharashtra kii siyasat main koi nayaa gul khilaa saktaa he
 Modi's mood will convince him to make Afzal Khan with him even after the election helplessness, the answer is difficult
 aresas ke bheetar yah kashmakash kahin tej he ki party, sanghathan or vichaar sab kuch rajnatik jeet-haar ke nazariye se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 But there is no alternative to the Sangh in the path that the BJP has led under Modi
 isiilie iskaa sabase zyada phayda kisi ko mil saktaa he to vah ensipi he
 The NCP chieftain who had become a villain in the last fifteen years in power, has quickly become the hero of his capital
 asal main sharad pavaar kii party har jile ke sabase taqatvar netaaon ke aasare hi chalati rahi he
 So, the long haul of scams BJP is printing every day through a page-long advertisement in the daily newspapers with Modi's picture has become ineffective
 congress-ensipi kii jaati hui satta par ab kisi kii najar nahin he
 The voters are eyeing the struggle of BJP and Shiv Sena
 iske aage 70 hajaar karod ru
 The talk of irrigation scam or Adarsh scam has become irrelevant
 sabaki dilchaspee isamen he ki bijepi satta main pahonchegi yaa shivasena
 The electoral equation is worsening by this
 isliye shivasena kii jarurat he ki mumbai main bhi gujarati or marathi takaraa jaaen jabaki bijepi kii aas he ki marathi maanush rojgaar or vikaas ko lekar gujaratiyon ke saath chale
 Uddhav Thackeray is realizing that Gujaratis settled in Mumbai and Western Maharashtra will no longer follow Thackeray as they see Gujarati Modi sitting in power in Delhi
 lekin modi kaa sankat doharaa he
 On one hand they are vowing not to let Maharashtra divide, but they do not want to hide the BJP slogan of separate Vidarbha
 darasal loksabhaa chunaav main modi hawa main vidarbha kii 62 siton main se bijepi-shivasena 59 siton par aage rahi to vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi apane boote 45 seat jeetne kaa khwab sanjoe hue he
 The reason for this is the promise of creating a state of Vidarbha
 lekin yah aawaaj tej hoti he to konkan or marathavada kii kshetreey takatein yani maratha se lekar kunbi or obisi bijepi se khisak sakate hai jiskaa aadhaar usne bala sahib thakare ke saath milakar pramod mahajan or gopinath munde ke bharose banaaya he
 That is why Modi and Amit Shah are playing the game of check and balance
 modi nagpur se chunaav lard rahe devendra fadavis kii khuli tarif kar rahe hai or amit shah pankaja munde kaa naam le rahe hai
 Fadnavis has been chanting Vidarbha and remembering the pair of Pankaja mahajan-munde, is struggling to maintain the bjp's social engineering in Marathwada
 shivasena bhi soshal ejiniyanksharag ke sach ko samajh rahi he
 Uddhav does not forget to tell untold stories of relations with mahajan-munde in speeches
 unki nigaah maratha, kunbi or obisi vot bank par jo he
 The Shiv Sena is also not failing to put Munde's picture on the stage for this
 narendra modi ensipi-congress sarkaar ke 15 baras ke shashan ko ghotaalon or lut kaa raaj bataakar baaji palatney kaa dam bhar rahe hai, lekin ab congress-ensipi se hi nikal kar aae 37 ummidavaar bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Apart from this, 14 candidates have entered BJP from other parties
 vahiin shivasena ko jis bijepi se do-do haath karne hai uske tikat par bijepi ke saath rahe 27 netaa chunaav lard rahe hai
 Even Totwani, a close friend of Devendra Fadnavis and a BJP worker, has stood against him on the Shiv Sena ticket
 muqabla chaukoniya he, so totavani kaa sindhi hona vidhansabha kshetra main 15,000 sindhi vot ke jariye kya gul khilaa saktaa he or sangharsh kaa paimaana kahaan aa pahunchaa he, yah isaki jwalanth misaal he

 ' dilli ke wazirabad ilaake se kidanap hue ek hi parivaar ke 4 logon kii hatya kii gutthi ko krime branch ne sulajhaa liya he
 Crime Branch team of Delhi Police arrested a person named Abhishek in this case
 bataa den ki 2016 main naina naam kii ek ladki kii hatya kar di gai thi
 Uttar Pradesh Police recovered Naina's body from a canal along with the car
 policejab maamle kii jaanch main juty to mritak ladki ke parivaar ke sabhi log ghar se nadaarad mili
 After this, the UP police understood the case of honor killing
 police ne is maamle main naina ke pita vedaprakash, maa sadhana or bhai shubham ko kaatil maan liya tha
 And investigating the case as an honor killing
 (pakad main aayaa aaropee)is puri vaardaat ko abhishek ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar anjaam diya tha
 Earlier, the UP police had told that the head of the family, Ved Prakash, killed the entire family, including his daughter
 lekin ab dilli police veda prakaash ko peedit bataa rahi he
 According to the police, Abhishek, along with his partner Bavla and some other accused, killed four family members one by one and then dumped their dead bodies in the immense canal Ganga of Hapur
 yah ghatana july 2016 main hui thi
 Accused Abhishek committed the crime while the Delhi Police received information about Abhishek's involvement in the whole incident
 soochna ke aadhaar par police ne usko giraftaar kiya
 When the police strictly questioned him, he confessed to the crime
 usne bataaya ki vah apane saathi bawalaa or veda prakaash ke rishtedaar sonu ke saath milakar yah sajeesh rachi
 Actually, Ved Prakash had given money to Abhishek and Ritesh
 ritesh kabhi veda prakaash kii garment kii dukaan par kaam karata tha lekin yah log paisa nahin lautaa rahe the
 Ved Prakash was upset about this
 iske baad abhishek ne sajeesh rachi or vaardaat kaa anjaam dene ke liye sthaneey apradhi bawalaa ko shaamil kiya
 The plan of the three was to capture the property of the family by killing
 plan ke tahat abhishek ne hathiyaar kharida or uske baad kisi bahaane se veda prakaash ko apane saath le gaya
 After this he along with Bavla killed Ved Prakash
 daramil veda prakaash ko abhishek ke saath jate hue bete shubham ne dekh liya tha
 Now he also called Shubham with his excuse and killed him too
 patni or beti kii bhi hatya keeiske baad abhishek ne veda prakaash kii patni sadhana ko or unki beti naina ko bhi bahaane se ek-ek karke ghar se bulaayaa or unki bhi hatya kar di or uske baad chaaron shavon ko apper canal ganga main phenk diya
 The vehicle was recovered by the Uttar Pradesh police in the case of Ved Prakash's daughter Naina
 haalanki police ko teen shav nahin mili the, jiske baad police ne is maamle ko honor kiling kaa maamla bataaya
 Now the Delhi Police has opened the case and said that it was not murder but honor killing under a thoughtful conspiracy and the murder was done by some people including Abhishek, Bavla alias Sonu, Ritesh
 police kii maane to is maamle main bawalaa kii sadak durghatana main maut ho chuki he, anya aaropee sonu ne khudakushi kar lee thi
 Police is investigating this matter
 is puri ghatana ne uttar pradesh police kii laaparvaahee ko ujagar kar diya he
 After all, why did the UP police act in this matter? kya jaanboojhkar to is maamle main kotahi nahin barti gai, kyonki is maamle main yah bhi saaf hua he ki peedit or inamen se aaropee ke bich phone par baatcheet hui thi to aakhir police ne yah jaanane kii koshish kyon nahin kii
 The questions are many, which the UP Police will have to answer
 rithik roshan or sujain khan kaa 17 saal kaa rishta khatm hone kii kagaar par he
 But it seems that the likes and desires of both are the same even today
 donon ne talaak kii arji de di he
 But both are trying to maintain friendship between them

 supreme court ne maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan senapramukh se yah bhi poocha tha ki unhone upiessi main apni janmatithi thik kyon nahin karwaai
 The court also made it clear that we have no doubt on the honesty of the army chief, and no discrimination will be done against him

 vaise ab yah tay ho gaya he ki senapramukh kii janmatithi 10 may, 1950 hi maani jaaegi, or unhen isi varsh may main sevanivrutt hona padega
 There is also speculation that he will now resign from his post
 supreme court ke mutabik unhone sarkaar or general, donon kii raay lekar hi maamle kaa nipataara karavaaya he
 During the hearing on the matter, the Supreme Court had also asked Senapramukh why he did not get his date of birth correct in UPSC
 court ne saath hi yah bhi saaf kiya ki hamen senapramukh kii eemaandaaree par koi shaq nahin he, or unke saath koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya jayega

 Jacqueline Fernandez is in the news these days due to the new version of the iconic song 'ek Do Teen'
 is gane main apane dance move ko lekar jacleen jamkar trol ho rahi hai
 On the song's choreography, the director of the film 'baaghi 2' Ahmed Khan says that we were ready for criticism while remaking this song
 original gaanaa maadhuri dikshit par film tejaab main filmaaya gaya tha
 From the clothes of Jacqueline to the dance song, the new song is being heavily criticized on social media
 yah dekhte hue ki ahamed kaa kahana he ki pehali baat, maine geet ko koreograph nahin kiya
 It has been created by choreographer Ganesh Acharya, i do not interfere in his work

 He said, our youth have a strong relationship with the film's leading pair, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patni
 jab ve is film main is gane ko dekhte hai, to ve ek puraane geet ke bare main jaanate hai, jise hamaari peedi dekhakar badi hui he
 When asked about Madhuri Dixit's reaction to this song, Ahmed said, giving feedback is her wish
 main is par kuch nahin kahuunga
 We made the song, bought it legally
 'ek do teen' par jacleen ko mila salmaan kaa saport, kaha
 
 
 Supporting Jacqueline on Twitter, Salman wrote, i liked this song very much
 jacleen ne saroj ji ke dance steps ke saath puraa nyaay kiya he
 Madhuri is difficult to match
 jacleen or varuna ko hamaare gaanon par dance karte dekh acha lagata he
 Keeping old songs alive is fantastic to watch
 mujhe garv mahasoos ho rahaa he
 Enjoy

 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against him by the Supreme Court
 gorakhpur se shuru hua sahaara pramukh kaa safar lakhanu hote hue ab videshon tak pahunch chukaa he lekin in sabake baavjood vivaad unka kaa peechha nahin chhod rahe hai
 The court of lawyers standing in favor of Subrata Roy has been misleading the Supreme Court with the help of legal bets, ever since the court has run the case in the case of giving investors Rs 24000 crore
 10 june, 1948 ko bihar ke arriya main janme subrat roy kii shuruaati shiksha-diksha kolkata main hui
 Subrata Roy, son of Sudhir Chandra Roy and Chitra Roy, studied mechanical engineering from a government college in Gorakhpur, UP
 subrat roy ne apana pehla kaarobaar gorakhpur se hi shuru kiya
 Subrata Roy is married to Swapna Roy
 subrat ko jaanane vaale bataate hai ki ve shuru se hi padhai main kamjor the
 His mind seemed to do more than read
 ek chote se shahar se bijness shuru karne vaale is shaks ne 36 saalon main duniya bhar main apana kaarobaar failaa liya
 When Subrata Roy started Sahara in 1978, he had only 2000 rupees in his pocket
 subrat ko 70 ke dashak se jaanane vaale log bataate hai ki tab subrat roy gorakhpur main ek scooter se chalate the
 Then people earning 100 rupees a day deposited 20 rupees with them
 subrat roy ke saath unke skool, college main saath padhe kareeb 100 dost bhi kaam karte hai
 If seen, the property of Sahara Group has spread from India to abroad
 iske alaava subrat roy kii karmbhumi rahi lakhanu main bhi kai property he
 But Sahara State has been in the most controversies
 lekin, samay samay par apni raajnneetik pahunch kaa istemaal karte hue sahaara shri vivaadon ko taalte rahe hai
 Sahara requested to allot 170 acres of land next to the Ambedkar memorial, located in the posh area of lucknow's posh Gomti Nagar and popularly known as the Dalit-class self-respecting Mayawati's dream in the country
 He will develop residential, commercial and green belt on this land
 darasal, gomtinagar main bana sahaara state subrat roy kaa dream project tha lekin, apane is dream project ko puraa karne ke liye sahaara ne herpher kaa sahaara liya
 But, politicians, actors and big players can enter this Sahara city but the common man of Lucknow cannot enter
there was a lot of discussion about jab yah sahaara shahar bana tab bhi isaki khub charchaa hui thi lekin jab jimmedaar adhikariyon ne iskaa nirikshan kiya to unhen subrat ke gorakhdhandhe kaa ahsaas hua
 But by then it was late
 nagar nigam ne sahaara ko kaaran bataao notice to jari kiya lekin nigam kii laaparvaahee tab tak subrat roy sahaara ke liye sanjivani kaa kaam kar chuki thi
 After getting the notice, Sahara also moved the court against the notice without delay
 sahaara yaheen nahin rukaa usne hai court kii lakhanu bench main arbitesan daakhil kar diya
 This matter is still pending in court
 is karwai main ek dashak se zyada kaa samay biit chukaa he lekin sahaara pehle kii tarah aaj bhi vahaan kabja kiye hue hai
 There was no problem as long as Mulayam was on Sahara's shoulder, but as soon as the change of power took place in 2007, Mayawati's eyes turned to Subrata Roy
 nagar nigam ne karwai karte hue sahaara state ke bade bade daravaajon par notice chaspa kar diya or uski badi badi deevaaren giraayi bhi gai lekin sahaara ko isse koi khaas fark nahin padaa
 However, this is a glimpse of Subrata Roy Sahara's controversies
 lekin, aarthik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar sahaara ko niveshkon ko paisa waapas karnaa padaa to uski haalat or kharaab ho jaaegi
 Because Sahara's reputation has been discounted after the sponsorship from Team India, the IPL franchise of Pune Warriors has also been canceled
 aise main subrat roy ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant aag main ghi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 There is hardly any woman who does not mind her man's affair
 lekin ek research se is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki mahilaon ko afaire se zyada us vakt dukh hota he jab unhen pataa chalata he ki unka partner kisi duusari mahila ke saath bhaavnaatmak rup se jud rahaa he
 According to this recent research, if the husband has sex with another woman, then the women are unhappy, but the wife is not at all allowed to have an emotional relationship with the woman
 research main shaamil do tihaai mahilaon ne kaha ki extra marital sex se zyada takalif tab hoti he jab pati kisi duusari mahila ke saath emoshanalee jud jate hai
 But this is not the case with men
 survey main shaamil hue purushon main se keval ek tihaai ne mana ki kisi paraye shaks ke saath patni ke jununi afaire se utani takalif nahin hoti jitani is baat se hoti he ki vah usase bhaavnaatmak rup se jud rahi hai
 Four out of five women surveyed stated that they feel more jealous when their partner falls in love with another woman, rather than having sex with them in different positions
 vahiin, aadhe se bhi zyada purushon ne kaha ki unhen is khyaal se hi gussa aa jaataa he ki unki partner kisi duusare purush ke saath hambistar ho
 The study, conducted in the United States, involved 477 adults who were sentimental and questioned in different scenarios such as sex with someone else, even while married
 survey ke mutabik adhiktar mahilaon ne kaha ki partner kaa kisi or ke saath imotional hona zyada dukhadaayi he
 On the contrary, men said that they suffer more from their partner's sexual affairs
 kisi paraye mard ke saath patni kaa physical afaire purush ke liye sabase bada dhokhaa he, lekin mahilaon ke saath aisa nahin he
 Every third woman in the survey said that if her partner had sex with her ex-girlfriend, it would hurt, but it hurt more when she started getting emotional with him
 duniya bhar ke mobile bazaar main pichley ek dashak main jabardast boom aayaa he
 Especially in the last 5-6 years, the technology of smartphones has made this market the smartest
 korea kii samsung telecommunication is bazaar main 24
 It is the largest company with a 6 per cent stake
 lekin samsung mobile kaa yah safar 29 saal purana he, jo ab jaakar safalataa ke sheersh par he
 It is interesting that Samsung India, which has maintained its dominance in all the countries of the world, used to consider Motorola Mobile as its benchmark
 samsung telecommunication ke bare main aisi hi kai baaten hai jo is brands kaa istemaal karne vaale yugers ko jaananaa chahie
 1
 samsung telecommunication 77 saal pehle 1938 main shuru hue samsung group kii sabsidiari company he
 2
 samsung telecommunication kii shuruyaat 1977 main hui
 The South Korean company deals in mobile phones as well as telecommunication systems, MP3 players and laptops
 3
 Samsung is the world's largest company with 46 percent share in the Android smartphone market
 4
 In 1983, the company forayed into the field of mobile telecommunications for the first time, while in 1986 the first built-in car phone was named as SC-100
 5
 This product of the company failed miserably, after which the then head of the wireless development team, Tai Li, requested to buy 10 mobile phones of Motorola from the company
 lee in phone ko benchmark ke taur par research wing ko dena chaahate the
 6
 do saal kii kadi mehnat ke baad 1988 main samsung ne dakshin korea main apana pehla mobile phone SH-100 launch kiya
 After this, the company launched a new model every year, but due to the lack of mobile phones, it could not sell more than 2 thousand units of any model
 7
 On June 7, 1993, Chairman Lee held a meeting with 200 executives of the company and under 'samsung New Management', within a year, set a target to produce the best product like Motorola Mobile
 8
 In November 1993, the company finally launched a new model called SH-700, which was highly appreciated
 9
 The company closely scrutinized every piece of the SH-700 and launched it into the market
 jis kisi pis main kharabi ai, use company ke karmchaariyon ke saamne jalaayaa taaki un tak sidhaa sandesh jaae ki kami ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 10
 saal 1994 main company ne kuch nae badlaav ke saath SH-770 ko launch kiya
 The special thing is that under a new policy, this phone was launched with the brand name of Anycall
 11
 The biggest problem for the company was to break the view that Samsung's phones are weaker and inferior to Motorola
 nae naam ke peeche graahakon ke vishwaas ko jeetna mukhya lakshya tha
 Read further, how the fate of Samsung changed
 
 
 12
 Samsung entered the world of CDMA service from 1996 to 1998 before entering the GSM era in 1998
 13
 The company became a 57% shareholder in the CDMA market in 1997, just a year after its introduction into the CDMA phone sector
 yahi nahin, mahaj ek saal main kapanni ne 10 lakh CDMA phone beche
 14
 saal 1997 main company gharelu bazaar se baahar honkong or brazil main mobile phone production kaa kaam shuru kiya
 In this way, Samsung stepped out of the cradle and knocked in the global market and the company was also taken up
 15
 Customer confidence in the company increased due to good penetration in the CDMA market
 is dauraan company ko do baar best minufekcharer kaa mobile news aword bhi mila
 Earlier, Nokia and Ericsson received this award
 16
 In 2004, Samsung made a direct debut in the Indian mobile market
 17
 After capturing connectivity and quality in 2008, the company set six goal points - Style, Infotainment, Multimedia, Connected, Essential and Business
 18
 This new strategy of the company proved to be effective and from here the company took a new flight
 19
 Samsung won the biggest bet in 2009 in the mobile phone world
 isse pehle tak bazaar feechar phone se aage badhkar rangeen, multimedia, tach screen or java ke rang main rang chukaa tha
 20
 saal 2009 ke june main company ne apana pehla android open sorce smartphone Samsung Galaxy (GT-I7500) launch kiya
 21
 usee saal november main company ne Samsung Galaxy Spica or gallexi portal launch kiya
 22
 smartphone bazaar main samsung ko sabase badi safalataa thik ek saal baad 2010 ke june main mili, jab company ne Samsung Galaxy s ko launch kiya
 23
 iske baad company ko peeche mudakar dekhne kii jarurat nahin padi
 As part of a well thought out policy, the company decided that it would launch more than one new model, new variants and better technology every year
 24
 Samsung's policy has worked and the journey has reached the Galaxy S6 and S6 EDGE today via Galaxy Ace, Galaxy s II, Galaxy Y, Galaxy Note, Grand, S4 and Alpha
 25
 Currently, Samsung Galaxy is the world's most purchased device after the Apple iphone

 During the 18th day hearing in the Ayodhya case, senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan, appearing for the Muslim side, said that installing the idol of God in the Babri Masjid was "a fraudulent attack"
 " rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu mahasabha ne kaha ki wo sarkaar ke paas is masale ko lekar jaaegi, iskaa matlab he ki court kaa ye adhikaar kshetra nahin he, is tarah ke sho par roak lagani chaiye "no mor rathyatra"
 Rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu side argues that the Muslim side does not have the rights to take possession of the disputed land, nor does the Muslim side offer namaz there
 uske peeche vajah ye he ki 1934 main nirmohi akhaada ne galat tareeke se avaidh kabja kiya
 We were not allowed to offer Namaz
 hinduon ne muslimon ko namaaj padhane se roak diya tha
 Justice Bobde asked if any action was taken on a Muslim when he complained that he was not being allowed to offer Namaz? Rajiv Dhawan said that the idol in the mosque was not a miracle but thought it was an "attack
" " unhone kaha, 'mehrab ke andar "allaah" shabd ke shilaalekh hai
 Dhawan presented the old photographs in the court, claiming that Babur and Allah were inscribed in Arabic script above the middle arch in the disputed building
 iske alaava kalma bhi likhaa tha
 In the northern arch also Allah wrote in Caligraphy i
e
 artistic writing thrice
 paas main hi phir ram ram bhi likh diya gaya
 Justice Bhushan and Justice Bobde asked if you would also present a picture of a pillar
 Dhawan did not give a clear answer to this but said that there was a lock for decades

 Nair's photo was later installed in the building
 saaf he ki wo hinduon ke paksh main bhedbhaav kar rahe the
 We can say that both sides continued to worship there
 lekin ye kaise kah sakate hai ki vahaan masjid nahin thi
 Dhawan showed a photo-map showing that the brown portion of 1480 yards has been given to the deity and the Nirmohi Akhara
 740 vargagaj kaa hissaa muslim pakshakaron ko diya gaya
 Dhawan said that Hindus claim that Ramji was born below the middle dome
 muslim paksh kaa kahana he ki aap kaise kah sakate hai ki ram vahiin paidaa hue the
 Such a big structure, your claim is not based on solid facts
 agar thodi der ko maan bhi len ki janm vahaan hua to parikrama ke daawey karne kaa kya matlab he?muslim pakshakaron kii ore se vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki 22-23 disambar 1949 kii raat se pehle to ramalala ram chabutare par hi the

 The outer enclosure had Ram Chabutara, Sita kitchen and stores
 jin par nirmohi akhaade kaa kabza tha
 Both Hindu and Muslim inside Ramlala's sanctum sanctorum
 lekin 22-23 disambar kii raat nirmohi akhaade ke saadhuon ne jabaran ghuskar masjid kii imaarat main ramalala kii murti rakh di
 It also has an FIR
 ghatana ke baad akhaade waalon ne vahaan gaiyr hinduon ke vahaan pravesh par pabandi laga di
 Dhawan said that his intimate friends suddenly reached the court in anticipation of possession, calling Ramlala a minor
 ab kanoon kii nigaah main sthapit vidhi ke mutabik ramalala kii murti ko kanoonee vyakti kii manyata to ho sakati he par wo mukadmaa nahin kar sakate
 We also completely agree with this argument of the Nirmohi Arena

 hindi diwas par apane whatsapp or Facebook par lagaaie ye Statuspahale pahal mahatma gandhi or jawaharlal nehru samet kai sadsy hindustani (hindior urdu kaa mishran) bhashaa ke paksh main dikhe
 It was only in 1937 that Nehru stated his opinion that it is necessary to have a language to establish official contacts across India and what could be better than Hindustani
 vahiin gandhi ne bhi kaha tha ki angreji se behatar hoga ki hindustani ko bharat kii rashtiya bhashaa banaaya jaae kyonki yah hindu or musalmaan, uttar or dakshin ko jodatii he
 But the partition caused so much anger and anger in the minds of many members that the demand of Hindustani was left behind and the supporters of pure Hindi ( Sanskritist) were seen to be overwhelming
 idhar dakshin bhartiya sadsy to hindustani or hindidonon ke hi khilaaf nazar aae
 Whenever a member spoke in Hindi or Hindustani, a South Indian member used to demand its translation
 Hindi Diwas 2019: in miseges se den hindi diwas kii shubhakamanaayenitihasvid ramchandra guha kii kitaab ‘india ofter gandhi' main is vivaadit vishay par roshni daali gai he
 Referring to one member RV Dhulekar, it is written - When Dhulekar started speaking his speech in Hindustani, the president interrupted him and said that many people present in the meeting do not know Hindi and therefore they do not understand him
 
 is par dhulekar ne tilamilaate hue kaha ki 'jinhen hindustani nahin aati, unhen is desh main rahane kaa haq nahin he
 On the other hand, TT Krishnamachari, representing Madras, said very clearly, 'I do not like English because it forced me to learn Shakespeare and Milton in which i was not interested at all
 ab agar hamen hindiseekhney ke liye majaboor kiya jayega to is umr main yah karnaa mere liye mushkil hoga
 At the same time, such intolerance will create fear in us that a strong central government also means enslaving people who cannot speak the language of the center
 sar
 
 
 i would like to warn on behalf of South Indians that there are already elements in South India who want to be divided there, from above my friends of UP will work only to increase our problem by spreading 'hindi imperialism'
 to mere upi ke dost yah tay kar len ki unhen ‘akhand bharat' chahie yaa ‘hindi-bharat'
 
 
 The Constituent Assembly reached an agreement after 'hard debate' that the official language of India would be Hindi (devanagari script) but all government functions (court and all other services) would be done in English for 15 years after the Constitution came into force
 'haalanki samvidhan sabha main liya gaya yah faisla 15 saal baad kuch or hi rang laayaa
 In 1963, Nehru gave direction to the Official Language Act, under which he pointed out that since 1965 all forms of communication will be officially done in Hindi and English can be used as a subsidiary language
 is
 nehru ke is sanket ne hindivirodhiyon ke kaan khadey kar die
 In this 'can', he got the hint of doubt that it may be that the Center can 'impose' Hindi on non-hindi speakers, English will be eliminated and not only that Hindi is also given the status of national language along with Rajbhasha
 Go 26 janvari 1965 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne hindiko rajbhasha ghoshit karne kaa faisla kar liya tha lekin usase pehle hi dakshin bhartiya raajnneetik party diemke ne is faisle ke khilaaf tamilnadu main virodh pradarshan kii ghoshnaa kar di
 From Madurai to Coimbatore and Madras to small villages, Hindi books were burnt, even there were some cases in which people died for the Tamil language
 itane virodh ke baad jaahir he congress apane faisle par naram padati nazar ai or shastri ne ol india radio par raashtra ke naam sandesh main saaf kiya ki angreji kaa istemaal tab tak kiya ja saktaa he jab tak janata chaahe
 At the same time removing the fear of non-hindi speakers, he assured that every state can decide on its own that in which language it wants to do official work or communication, it can be regional language or even English
 saath hi kendriya str par hindike saath saath angreji bhi pramukh taur par kaamkaaj or sanchaar kii bhashaa hogi
 After such strong opposition, Hindi got the status of the official language of India but the status of 'national language' continued to get
 yah baat alag he ki kai schuli kitabon main hindiko rashtriya bhashaa bataa diya jaataa he jo ki tathyaatmak rup se galat he kyonki bharat kii koi rashtriya bhashaa he hi nahin
 No one has the status of a national language in the Indian Constitution
 rajbhasha vibhagadwara yah saaf kiya gaya he ki hindike saath hi saath angreji ko bhi sansad or centre main kaamkaaj ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the states have the right to decide their own language under the legislature, as a result of which 22 languages have official status in India, including English and Hindi
 alag alag maukon par adaalat dwaara yah saaf kiya gaya he ki in sabhi bhashaaon ko barabari kaa darja hasil he or koi bhi bhashaa kisi se bhi kam yaa zyada nahin he
 There is another interesting anecdote in the book written by Guha
 radio par laal bahadur shastri kii is ahm ghoshnaa ke baad ek baar phir jab yah maamla sansad main uthaa to anglo bhartiya sadsy frank anthony ne angreji ko sweekaar nahin karne kii hindibhashiyon kii 'ashishnutaa' par chintaa jataai
 In response to this, JB Kripalani jokingly said that Frank should not worry about the ending of his language (english) in India because 'now even our children are starting to speak amma-appa and not Mummy Papa
 yahaan tak kii ham apane kutton se bhi angreji main hi baat karte hai
 Kripalani taunted the English with its feet and gave Anthony the 'confidence' that the English could disappear from England but never from India

 At the same time, BCCI officials believe that it is necessary that head coach Ravi Shastri remains in this position, so that captain Virat Kohli will help to progress
 bisisiai ke ek senior adhikari ne ieenes se kaha ki team ke is badlaav ke daur main shastri or kohli kaa apane pad par bane rahanaa mahatvapurn tha, kyonki team 2020 ke tii-20 world cap ko dekhte hue yuvaaon ko mauka dena chaahati he
 The official said, "in this period of change, nothing should be permanent for long
 shastri or kohli ek-duusare ke poorak hai or is safal team ke aadha hisse ko badalanaa sahi nahin hoga
 The official said that it was important to maintain consistency in the team, as a change of coach could mean that new coaches would mold the players in their own ways from the beginning
 unhone kaha, 'coach kaa badlaav us sameekaran ko bigaadane vaala sabit ho saktaa he jo maujuuda khilaadiyon ko baahar nikaalane ke liye maansik sthaan kii anumati detaa he
 If a change is made at this time, it will be a change of strategy and plan for the next five years
 'bisisiai ne rashtriya team ke koching staff ke liye aavedaan maange hai
 The current coach of the team Ravi Shastri and his colleagues will not need to apply though
 unhen intvyuu main sidhe pravesh milegaa
 The tenure of the current coaching staff ended after the World Cup ended, but their tenure was given a 45-day extension

 Yes, we are talking about US President Barack Obama
 agar ham aapse puuchhen ki aapane america raashtrapati ko patni mishael obama ke bina kitni baar dekha he to shaayad aapako yaad na pade
 In any corner of the world, Michelle always appears with him
 donon kii pahchaan ek adarsh dampati ke taur par hoti he
 They are also seen as America's most romantic couple
 inke bich kaa pyaar vaaki ek misaal he
 Especially for men who bypass their wife-children citing their busy work
 aap khud hi sochie, kya baraak ke paas kaam kii kami hogi
 
 
 Still, he gives his wife plenty of time
 10 aisi baaten jo sabit karti hai ki ek behtareen pati hai baraak1
 Obama may be the most powerful person in the world but he also loves to romance his wife
 ek televijan intervyuu ke dauraan mishael ne khud ye baat sweekaar kii thi ki unke pati kai baar sirf unke liye hi gaanaa gaate hai or unki aawaaj acchhee he
 2
 mishael ne democratic party ke rashtriya adhiveshan main kaha tha ki baraak niswaarth prem karnaa jaanate hai
 They also do not hold back in sacrificing for love
 unke liye bhautik chijen myne nahin rakhti
 3
 mishael ne isi dauraan ye bhi kaha tha ki baraak bhale hi raashtrapati banakar white house pahunch gaye hon lekin wo aaj bhi vaise hi hai jaise 23 saal pehle the
 Michelle said in unequivocal terms that she is the one whom he had loved years ago
 4
 Every wife wants her husband to just praise her beauty and call her attractive
 baraak obama bilkul aise hi hai
 Barack admits that Mitchell is very attractive
 5
 Listen to husband and wife, what can be better than this
 baraak obama ne ek intervyuu main khud sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone apni patni mishael ke kehane kii vajah se hi smoking chhod di
 6
 obama saarvajanik manch par bhi apane pyaar kaa izhaar karne main peeche nahin rahete
 On Ellen degeneres's show, she called Michelle a wonderful woman in front of the whole world and expressed her love
 7
 As many pictures of Barack Obama and Michelle appear on social media and news portals, both of them are seen holding each other's hands
 ye pyaar nahin to or kya he
 In an interview, Obama also said, i have got eyes so that i can see you
 baraak kai baar kah chuke hai ve hameshaa mishael kii salaah par amal karte hai or koi bhi bada faisla mishael se bina puche nahin karte
 In the midst of all the US presidential engagements, he used to make time for Mitchell every day and usually do morning exercises and breakfast together
 8
 While political history was made in August 2012, a picture of Barack and Michelle also broke records
 is tasviir main baraak or mishael ek-duusare ko gale lagaae hue hai
 Barack attributes his success to Michel and believes that he is far more capable than he is
 patni ko itnaa sammaan dena, ek achche pati kii hi to nishaani he
 9
 ek acha pati vahi hota he jo khud to aage bade hi lekin apni partner ko bhi aage badhane main madad kare
 Support him mishael bhale hi america kii pratham mahila kyon na hon lekin unki apni bhi ek pahchaan he or log unhen unke vichaaron ke liye jaanate hai
 10
 is ek baat se ye sabit ho jaataa he ki baraak ko apni patni se kitna pyaar he
 Barack held Michelle's purse while landing by plane during the India tour
 ho saktaa he kuch log ise joru kaa gulam hona kahen lekin baraak ke liye to ye pyaar jataane kaa ek mauka tha, jise unhone yun hi jane nahin diya

 bachapan main mili shiksha or soch jeevanabhar bachche ke saath rahati hai

 One who lives in politics stays among the public

 Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has alleged that Sushil Kumar Modi is misleading the public in the case of soil scam
 unhone susheel kumaar modi se mitti ghotaale kii jaanch nigaraanee ko lekar 15 sawaal daage hai
 Significantly, the current Deputy Chief Minister of the state Sushil Kumar Modi is also the Minister of Forest and Environment
 tejasvi yadav ke mal kii mitti se patna ke sanjay gandhi jaivik udyaan main mitti kii bharaai main ghotaale ko lekar nigaraanee jaanch kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 When Tejashwi Yadav's mall was being stuffed in the garden with soil, the Minister of Forests and Environment was Tej Pratap Yadav
 ab tejasvi ne aarope lagaaya he ki susheel kumaar modi janata ko gumraah kar rahen hai
 Tejashwi Yadav has asked Sushil Modi 15 questions
 duusari taraf, upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bhi press conference kar tejasvi yadav se kai sawaal puche hai unhone kaha ki kai aise mudde he jis par jaanch nahi kii gai he or usee kii jaanch ke liye nigaraanee ko jimmedaari saupi gai he
 These are 15 questions of Tejashwi
 mukhya sachiv ne aapke tathakthith mitti ghotaale ke sabhi aaropon kaa binduvaar jawaab diya tha
 He is still the Chief Secretary
 kya aapako vartmaan mukhya sachiv kii qabiliyat par bharosa nahin he?2
 In the department under you, when you find out that there is nothing in this matter, then you are pretending to hand over surveillance or not? 3
 wo sabhi adhikari jinhone purv main jaanch report saunpi thi, kya aap unako daraa-dhamka kar galat report likhavana chaahate hai
 Is it the law or not
 adhikari jaanate hai ki isamen kisi vibhageeya mantri kii koi bhoomika nahin hoti
 Do you want to trap them in the chasm of your inferior politics? 4
 aapke van evam paryaavaran vibhaag ke purv ke kaarykaal main bina tender ke 175 karod se zyaada ke jo kaary hue, un par aapaki jaankaree or citti-pitti kahaan gum ho jaati he? aap us vaqt galat the yaa ab hai?5
 You become more knowledgeable and investigative, tell me if any departmental minister interferes in such matters? 6
 kya aap ghapalebaji karte hai, isliye aapkaa ghapalon main zyaada yaqiin he?7
 Why do you tell your distant brother and sister a distant relative after getting caught in scams? If honest, why fear the truth? 8
 aapke saath srijan ghotaale main sanlipt shrimati rekha modi ji aapaki bahan hai yaa nahin?9
 Did you buy flats worth crores or not in your brother Rajkumar Modi's black money white real estate company, Ashiana Homz? Yes or No? 10
 aapane rajkumaar modi ke naam power aaf atarni kii yaa nahin?11
 Is it not true that because of all these gimmicks, you are cheating Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at the behest of your high command? Defying the investigation report of their officers? 12
 kya us vaqt ke zu nideshak ne puri prakriya ko niyamsangat or paardarshee bataaya tha? haa yaa nahin?13
 Does the master of lies, hypocrisy, deceit, rumor and jumlebashi Sushil Modi consider himself to be true and the whole world bad? 14
 kya upmukhyamantri banane ke baad apni uplabdhiyon ko lekar aapane koi press conference kii he?15
