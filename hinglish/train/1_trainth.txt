 For this reason, the angry Beni Prasad Verma left the Samajwadi Party and created a socialist revolution

 modi sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan vittiya jagat par bada prabhaav daalane vaale kai bade faisle liye hai
 These include demonetisation by closing 86 per cent of the currency circulating in the country and replacing it with new currency, enforcing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) under the concept of One Nation One Tax and npas of banks to address the crisis
 This includes payment of millions of crores from the government treasury
 isi kram main modi sarkaar banking vyavastha main ek or kanoon bana rahaa he jiskaa vyapak asar na sirf bainkon par padegaa balki bank main bachat khate main paisa rakhane vaala ek-ek graahak is kanoon ke daayre main rahegaa
 What is the new law? The Central Government is going to prepare the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill (FRDI Bill) 2017 in Parliament during the forthcoming winter session
 sansad ke donon sadanon main pukhta bahumat ke kaaran yah bill aasaani se paas hokar nayaa kanoon bhi ban jayega
 Earlier this bill was introduced by the Central Government in Parliament during the monsoon session and then it was sent to the Joint Parliamentary Committee for suggestion
 ab ek baar phir kendra sarkaar joint parliamentry cameti kii sujhaavon ko dekhte hue nae bill kaa prastaav sansad main pesh karegi
 Why is the new law necessary? This new law being prepared by the central government will create a new framework to deal with the problem of insolvency in both government and private banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions
 kendra sarkaar kaa daawa he ki yah kanoon desh main banking or insolvency code, sarkari bainkon ke ricapitalijesh plan or insurance sector main videshi nivesh kii manjuuri ke baad financial sector kaa ek landmark riform hoga
 How will this law change your bank? With the new FRDI Act of the Central Government, an existing law Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation will be abolished
 maujuuda samay main alag-alag bainkon main jamaa aapke paise kii guarantee isi kanoon se milti he
 An important provision in this law is that if a bank is declared insolvent in the event of ill-health, the bank's customers will have to return a deposit of one lakh rupees to the bank
 lihaaja isi kanoon se desh kii maujuuda banking vyavastha sabase surakshit or vishwasaneey mana jaataa he
 Due to this secure banking system, customers of banks in the country have confidence in the bank that their money can never be sunk
 kisi bank ko diwalia karne par bhi sarkaar graahakon ke diposit kii guarantee is kanoon se detii he
 a new resolution corporation will be formed, but provision will be made through the new law where this assumption will be completely eliminated
 puraane kanoon ko hataate hue vitt mantralay ke adheen ek nae rejolution corporation ko sthapit kiya jayega
 At present, the Reserve Bank used to assess the financial position of a bank and advise it to come out of the financial crisis
 lekin echardiai kanoon paas karne ke baad nayaa rejolution corporation is kaam ko karne lagegaa
 The most dangerous provision of the new law: Permanent demonetisation Bailout package is given to the banks in case of financial crisis in the bank in the country
 yah belout packagekendra sarkaatpane khajaane se detii he or corporate sector main gande karj baantkar barbaad hua bank is belout package ke sahare dubaara khadey hone kii koshish karata he
 Provision has been made under the FRDI Act that banks can now resort to bail-in instead of bailout
 lihaaja, ab bainkon ke enpie kii samasya teevr hone par nayaa rejolution corporation yah tay karegaa ki bank main graahakon ke diposit kiye gaye paise main graahak kitna paisa nikaal saktaa he or kitna paisa bank ko uskaa enpie paatane ke liye diya ja saktaa he
 For example, at present, you can withdraw your one lakh rupees lying in a savings account in the bank whenever you want and as much as you want
 lekin nayaa kanoon aa jane ke baad kendra sarkaar nae corporation ke jariye tay karegi ki aarthik sankat ke samay main graahakon ko kitna paisa nikaalane kii chhot di jaae or unki bachat kii kitni rakam ke jariye bainkon ke gande karj ko paatane kaa kaam kiya jaae

 This time the department has not issued such a statement on the return filed in 2018-19
 yani is baar pichley akalan varshon ke liye daakhil ritern ko inamen nahin joda gaya he
 The CBDT in a statement released on Monday made it clear that in FY 2017-18, which is 6 in total
 74 karod iskar ritern daakhil kiye gaye the, unamem se 5
 47 crore income tax returns are for the assessment year 2017-18
 iske mukaable vitt varsh 2018- 19 main kul 6

 49 karod ritern akalan varsh 2018-19 ke hai

 iskar kanoon main vitt varsh or akalan varsh alag-alag hai

 Ram Raheem has been sentenced to 20 years in prison in the rape case
 vah rohtak jail main band he
 But social media and some news channels are raising suspicion that the real behind bars is not Ram Rahim, but his lookalike
 haryana police ab is jaanch main juty he ki jail main band ram rahim asli he yaa haniprit ke saath faraar ho gaya he
 At the same time, Ram Rahim has handed over a list of 10 people to the jail administration, who will come to meet him
 is list main ram rahim ne apni sabase kareebi or kathith dattak putree haniprit kaa naam sabase pehle likhaa he
 After this, he has named both his daughter-son-in-law, son-daughter-in-law and some dera sevadars
 usne haniprit se baat karne ke liye uskaa mobile number bhi diya he
 Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that some objectionable material has been recovered during the search and investigation of 117 'naam discussion houses' of Dera Sacha Sauda
 gurmeet ram rahim singh ke sirsa sthit deraa sachcha sauda ke mukhyalay se 33 kaaphi khatarnaak hathiyaar baraamad hue hai
 It is being told that upon seeing them, even the police officers got their hands and feet swelled
 deron kii talaashi kaa abhiyaan jarikhatter ne bataaya ki deraa adhikariyon ne rajya sarkaar ko hathiyaar saunp die hai
 They are also cooperating with the state government
 yadi yah uchit tareeke se chal rahaa he to acha he
 Action will be taken on receipt of complaint in this regard
 haalanki, unhone yah nahin bataaya ki kis tarah ke hathiyaar yaa saamagree baraamad hui hai
 At present, the search for the dera is going on
 deraa kaa samrajya, sampatti kaa byorasirsa main sthit chota deraa varsh 1948 main shah mastaana ji dwaara sthapit kiya gaya tha
 At that time there used to be 2 rooms in the small camp
 isamen se ek main swayan shah mastaana ji rahete the
 The underground portion below these rooms was adapted to life
 us samay asi kii vyavastha nahin thi, isliye in kamaron main garmiyon main thandak or sardiyon main garmi rahati thi
 In this way Baba ji's caveman Mastana ji's serviceman used to call that room a cave at that time
 iske peeche unka tark tha ki babaaji gupha main ekant main sadhana main leen rahete hai
 The tradition of this cave word is also prevalent till the era of Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 bataaya jaataa he ki shah mastaana ji ke vakt main deraa ke paas kul 5 acre jameen thi, jo ab badhkar 1093 acre ho chuki he
 In 1990, Ram Rahim got the throne, in 1960, Sardar Harbans Singh, resident of Jalalana, a village in Sirsa, was replaced by Shah Mastana ji with the new name Shah Satnam
 is gaddi ko sanbhaalane vaale sant shah satnam ji ne deraa kii paramparaon ko aage badhaayaa
 They also used to stay in this small camp

 Baghdadi has laid its pawns in Iraq and Syria to save the Sultanate of Panic
 inamen kuch chote hai kuch bade hai
 Some are heavy and some are just pawns
 magar is bisaat ke pyaadon ko kam mat samajhiega
 These looks are definitely small
 magar asar inkaa itnaa he ki saamne vaale ke kile ko ek jatke main bhed dete hai
 Baghdadi is trying to save his throne by keeping them in front of them
 inhen se use sabase zyaada ummid bhi he
 Yes, they are innocent pieces of Baghdadi
 sinjar kii pahadiyon par chadhakar bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne pichley kai saalon main jo tabaahi machaai
 We saw just that
 auraton kii izzat ko taar-taar kiya gaya
 The world sighs
 bujurgon or javaanon ko maar diya gaya
 Everyone's heart ached
 magar kahani vahiin khatm ho jaati to phir bhi ganimat thi
 The reality is that the story starts after that
 bagdadi ke garh se ai ye kahani un do masuumon kii he jinke baap-dadaon ko bagdadi ne maar daalaa
 Looted the honor of the mothers and sisters
 unhen qayaamat ke is din ke liye bachaa kar rakhaa
 Yes, this story is about Amjad and Assad
 wo do yazidi ladke jinhen maanon kii god se aatanki chin laae the
 For years, his mind was poisoned
 haathon main khilone kii jagah ye baari bharkam eke-47 thamai gai he
 It is Baghdadi's turn to take advantage of the lives of these innocent people
 aaj inhen bilkul alag tarah kaa kaam diya gaya he
 They are welding these vehicles according to their mission
 use paint kar rahe hai
 Preparing ahead
 magar sawaal ye ki aakhir in nanhen masuumon ko aisa kya mishan mila he jiske liye ye bandook tham kar khadey hai
 Actually Baghdadi wants to use them to reduce its fear
 wo khauf jo uske liye kurdish, iraqi, shiya, milicia or america phujon ne paidaa kiya he
 Awe of death badla chahta he bagdadi in phujon se
 Revenge of the death of his terrorists
 apane thikaanon ke tabah hone kaa badla
 Revenge for the loss of our land
 dehshat ke kam ho jane kaa badla
 For this, these two children of Yazidi community will take all this change
 pichley 3 saalon tak inke dimag main itnaa zehar bhar diya gaya he ki ab ye apana mazahab bhi badal chuke hai
 Your aim too
 ab ye bagdadi ke liye kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar hai
 They have already taken training in terror
 ab inhone aatank failaane kii kasam bhi kha lee he
 It has been brain washed that they now think exactly what Baghdadi tells them to think
 bagdadi us bhalaa kaa naam he jo apane phaayde ke liye kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 He will not just leave them to die
 balki inhen ke zarie wo duniya ko apane aatank kaa paigaam pahunchayegaa
 They are trying to trick the wandering youth of the world by sending their children on a mission
 inke zarie wo ye bataanaa chaah rahaa he ki duniya kitni buree or akelaa wo hi bhala he
 The interview ended and now it is the turn of these children to sacrifice on Baghdadi
 inamen se ek ko yani amjad ko barood se bhari is gaadi kii chaabi di gai he
 There is only a seating area for the driver or else it is full of ammo
 ab tak to aap samaj hi gaye honge ki bagdadi ne inhen itane baras kyon paala he
 That's because he can make them fidayeen
 ye uske liye jaan de saken
 The journey of death started with the pressing of the start button in the car
 target dur khadey sena ke ye tanker hai jinhen ek takkar ke saath tabah or barbaad karnaa he
 Through the streets, Amjad drove this ammo-filled carriage to the exact spot where the four Iraqi army tankers stood together
 ek dhamaakaa hua
 The whole area resonated
 aag kii lapten saikadon feet upar tak ai
 Everything was ruined in an instant
 abhi to aapane bagdadi ke sirf ek mohare ko dekha
 There is still a second pawn whose mind has filled so much poison in the last 3 years that he is now ready to die
 jaan dekar wo bagdadi kii dehshat kaa paigaam sunaane

 dangi ne apane parichiton or rishtedaaron ko piesil main nivesh karaayaa, lekin jab company dub gai to ye dangi se hi paise maangane lage
 Dangi has also sunk 40 thousand in PACL
 unhone jise customer banaaya unamem se kisi ke das hazaar to kisi ke pachaas hazaar tak duube hai
 When money was not received, relatives and acquaintances became enemies
 dangi ko chor samajha jane laga
 Dangi very much explained that the decision of the Supreme Court has come
 lodha cameti bani he
 Money will be returned in six months but no one got the money
 nateeja yah he ki log hi log ke dushman ho gaye hai
 i am telling this story so that the real story of the people looted by the chit fund company reaches you and you can also see the real face of your politics
 is vakt jab piesiel khabaron se baahar he, is company ke karnaamon ko lekar log aapas main ek duusare ko maar peet rahe hai
 Dangi told that in Madhya Pradesh itself, there will be around forty thousand agents
 chhattisgarh main bhi itane hi agent honge
 Where the number of agents are and how many lakh customers are true, the exact number is with the Lodha Committee of SEBI, yet on the basis of estimates people give such numbers

 isi khabar main yah bhi likhaa he ki vidisha main yah chauthi ghatana he jab agent ne aatmahatya kii he or madhya pradesh main is tarah kii bees ghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 There was also a candle march regarding Ravi Pal in which people vowed Ravi's justice
 ham sab in khabaron se anjaan rahe
 This clipping is of the new world, in which it is written that an agent of Rozwali Chit Fund committed suicide in Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh and committed several lakhs
 customer usee se paise maang rahe the
 This is Wazir Prasad, who runs a grocery shop in Kamla Nagar, Agra
 piesiel main apana saadhe chah lakh jamaa karaayaa or duusare graahak bhi banaae
 Another chitfund became an agent of the company
 is tarah vajeer prasad ne kai agent banaae or graahak bhi
 All together deposited about Rs 90 lakhs in the chit fund company
 company band ho gai or paisa dub gaya
 On the day Wazir Prasad is pressurized that if money is given to him, he should give it
 ve vaada karte hai, nahin chukaa paane par police pakad le jaati he or aaj hi zamaanat par reeha hue hai
 The lives of these agents were ruined
 apane vishwaas par rishtedaaron kaa paisa jamaa karvaa diya
 Social reputation was gone
 jo paisa duba wo itnaa zyaada tha ki apana sab kuch bechakar bhi waapas nahin kar sakate hai
 If you see their concern in the debate about the chit fund company, then let me know
 philhal uttar pradesh or rajasthan ke kuch agenton kii vyathaa sun lijie
 It is not that customers are not upset
 in agent ko pataa he ki graahak ke saath unka paisa bhi fansaa he
 That is why they fight for everyone

 But once looking at the old pictures of these demonstrations, there is also a time to worry whether the media really understands the people's suffering
 aaj bhupesh baghel sarkaar ne agenton ke khilaaf daayar cese waapas le liye
 It is said that 200-300 agents were reported to have been the case
 ek vaada to puraa kar diya lekin kya sarkaar piesiel ke peediton ko paise dilaa paaegi
 When the decision of the Supreme Court could not be given in three years, then can the Congress government get it
 bharat bhar main faile kareeb 6 karod log sirf piesiel ke dhokhe ke shikaar hue hai
 Their condition was seen so that when you hear a loud statement by a minister, spokesperson and chief minister worrying about the money of these common people, then remember this episode of prime time

 They joined people struggling for the victims of PACL
 ravivaar kii sabha main bijepi ko chhod kai dalon ke netaa aae the, jabaki bijepi ke saansadon ko bhi gyaapan diya gaya tha or aamantran bhi
 Yadav says this is a systematic corporate scam
 bina raajnneetik sangrakshan or sampark ke nahin ho saktaa he
 Such a large number of companies are taking money from the people in the name of savings scheme and running away, why does not anyone get noticed
 in logon kaa na sirf rojgaar chalaa gaya balki sari puunji chali gai
 There is no regret in the system
 raajnneeti itani juthi or krur ho chuki he ki aaraam se taal thonk detii he ki ham chote niveshkon ke hiton kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 The Supreme Court should also review its decision as to why these crores of people cannot get their money back till three years later

 el ai pi hai yani les emportent person hai
 On the other hand, the decision of the Supreme Court did not imply that any constitutional crisis had arisen
 faisla is tarah aayaa jaise kisi routine bel kaa maamla ho

 After the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the differences of Rajasthan Congress have come to the surface
 ab rajya mensattarudh congress ke ek vidhayak nekaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main party kii karaari haar kii jimmedaari mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko leni chahie
 Party MLA Prithviraj Meena has also demanded to make Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot the chief minister
 aapako bataa den kiloksabhaa chunaav memrajasthan mencongress ko sabhi 25 siton par haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa or uske baad se party main khemebaaji or khinchataan chal rahi he
 Congress MLA from Todabhim seat in the state told reporters at the party's state headquarters here, "when the party is in power, the responsibility of the chief minister is for the defeat and if the party is in the opposition, that responsibility rests with the party president"
 
 vidhayakaprithviraj meena ne kahakaha, 'sachin payalat ko mukhyamantri banaaya janaa chahie
 This is my personal opinion '
 meena ne kaha ki vah yah baat pehle bhi kah chuke hai kyonki vidhansabha chunaav main party unheen ke kaaran jiti
 Let me tell you that recently, Chief Minister Gehlot said in an interview to a TV channel that state president Sachin Pilot should at least take responsibility for the party's defeat in Jodhpur seat because he was claiming a spectacular victory there

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched another scathing attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 party ne kaha he ki manmohan yadi 'netaa' hote to koyala block aavanton maamle main ab tak istipha de chuke hote, lekin unhone aisa isliye nahin kiya, kyonki vah ek naukarshah hambijapi ne apane mukhpatr 'camel sandesh' ke taaja ank main 've netaa hote to istipha de dete' sheershak se likhe gaye sampadakeey main yah baat kahi he
 In this, the Prime Minister has been attacked, as well as the Congress and Congress President Sonia Gandhi have also been targeted
 isamen sonia ke videshi mul ke mudde ko bhi hawa dene kii koshish kii gai he
 The article said, "if Manmohan Singh had been a natural leader, he would have resigned for the dignity of the Prime Minister's post, dignity of the post and saving the honor of the Constitution and the faith of citizens in democracy, but he is the original As a bureaucrat, this expectation from him is meaningless
 'isamen congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha gaya he, 'congress kitni khokhli ho gai he ki vah ek videshi ko adhyaksh banaati he or vahiin ek naukarshah rahe vyakti ko desh kaa pradhanmantri banaati he
 Bureaucrat leader and leader cannot be a bureaucrat
 'lekh main congress par hamalaa jari rakhte hue kaha gaya he, 'congress ne desh main naiysargik netaaon ko samaapt karne kaa silsilaa prarambh kar diya he
 The beginning of the process of making bureaucrats a leader is the result that the Indian Parliament has become a market of scams
 'sampadakeey main vartmaan raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko ek netaa bataate hue kaha gaya he, 'manmohan singh ke haathon aath varsh kendriya mantri ke rup main pranab mukherjee ghutan kii jindagi jite rahe lekin vah aakhir kya karte

 The latest incident is Tuesday in which former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has accused the Yogi government of stopping him from going to Prayagraj
 akhilesh ilahabaad uniwarsity ke chaatr sangh ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ja rahe the
 He was to fly to Prayagraj from a chartered plane but was stopped saying that the SP leader had not taken his permission
 is ghatana ko sirf isliye badi nahin bol sakate ki kisi purv mukhyamantri ko apane hi rajya main jane se roka gaya balki is vaakye ne bade str par apni chhap isliye chodi kyonki bijepi or modi sarkaar se khaar khaae kai dalon or netaaon ne akhilesh ke paksh main dhadadhad bayaan jari kiye or samarthan jataayaa
 Akhilesh Yadav himself said that the UP government is so scared of him that it is preventing him from joining a program
 pratikriya sirf akhilesh tak hi simit nahin rahi
 There is an alliance between the SP and the BSP, so the BSP supremo Mayawati also jumped into the political arena and called it a symbol of the dictatorship of the BJP government and the murder of democracy
 mayawati ne ek twit main kaha, "samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke adhyaksh or uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko mangalvaar ko elahabaad nahin jane dene ki liye unhen lakhanu hawaondde par hi roak lene kii ghatana ati-nindaneey or bhaajapa sarkaar kii taanaashaahee va loktantr kii hatya kaa pratik he
 "she questioned whether the bjp's central and state government has become so much intimidated and intimidated by the BSP-SP alliance that it is bent on stopping them from doing their political activity and party programs
 aasaan shikaar bani bijepihal ke ghatnakramon par nigaah daalen to yah teesri ghatana he jisane bijepi ko baikfoot par laane ko majaboor kiya he or mahagathbandhan ko virodh karne kaa aasaan mudda lapka diya he
 The BJP or its governments may clarify that the work is being done in a way that is reasonable, but the Grand Alliance parties are not taking any advantage in cashing it in their own way
 mangalvaar kii ghatana yogi sarkaar ke liye kanoonee yaa prashasnic karrwai ho sakati he lekin akhilesh or mayawati ke bayaan se saaf he ki bijepi sarkaar 'taanaashaahee' par utar ai he
 It is an election season and it will have to scrutinize each step of the government closely
 karrwai prashasnic kyon na ho, uske siyaasi myne nikaale jaaenge
 Therefore, the statement of Chief Minister Yogi does not matter that the security situation does not deteriorate, so Akhilesh was stopped
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki sapa ko apni arajak gatividhiyon se baj aana chahie
 Yogi said, “kumbh is going on in Prayagraj
 abhi 10 din pehle hi akhilesh yadav prayagraj gaye the
 He had a darshan
 ab prayagraj jila prashasan ne ashanka jaahir kii he ki hinsa ho sakati he
 The SP wants to escalate the anarchy

 Therefore, the administration had made this demand from the district administration

 Naidu and Opposition solidarity Just before Chandrababu Naidu's arrival in Delhi and fasting in the country's capital, Satyagraha was less political
 naidu chaahate to amravati yaa hyderabad main bhi upwas kar sakate the lekin jo sanket desh kii rajdhani main baith kar unhen dena tha, shaayad ve isamen kaamyaab na hote
 Adding fuel to the fire was that just a day before the fast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a tour of Guntur and launched an attack on the Naidu family which may not have been expected by Naidu
 pradhanmantri ne naidu ke bete ko 'velth criation' se joda or 'san rij' (ugte suraj) ko bete ke rij se
 The truth of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations and how much adulteration will be discussed later, but the parties of the grand alliance supported Naidu and many leaders gathered on the dais in Delhi to make the Modi government and BJP drink water Cursing
 naidu yah kehete sune gaye ki "modi sabhi ko dhamka rahe hai, vipakshi, naukarshah, corporate or yahaan tak ki media ko bhi
 He is pitting the CBI, ED and Income Tax Department against the opposition and opponents
 " unhone kaha, "ham loktantr bachaana chaahate hai
 Today it is democratic compulsion for all parties to come together to save the country
 "naidu kii baton se saaf he ki unka anshan mahaj pratikatmak tha
 The real target was to bring together the parties which are against the Modi government and have the status of opposition parties
 tabhi vipakshi partiyon se ekajute hone kaa aahvaan karte hue naidu ne kaha ki "hamen yah dimag main rakhana hoga
 Modi was given an absolute majority
 unhone kya kiya? kuch nahin
 The BJP and Modi are playing a game of dividing the opposition by asking who is your leader
 " naidu ne or bahut kuch bolaa lekin shaam hote-hote desh-duniya ne dekha ki vipakshi ekajute hai or modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hai
 What the BJP got out of this is a thought, but the sympathy received by Naidu and the Opposition was definitely noticed

 Seeing the increasing anger of the people, the police tried to flee towards Dhenkanal via the Neelkanth Ghat of the Brahmin river
 ye log barish main bheegate hue nadi kinare pahunche
 Baji Raut accompanied the boat to the river bank
 unhen paar karaane kaa hukum diya gaya
 "sehwag told," Baji had heard the story of army atrocities
 unhone sena ko paar utaarne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The soldiers threatened to kill him
 hukum na maanane par ek sainik ne bandook kii bat se unke sir par prahaar kiya, vah lahooluhaan hokar gir pade or phir uth khadey hue or angrejon ko paar utaarne se manaa kar diya
 The 12-year-old stalker neither intimidated nor ran away from him, but strongly confronted him

 Salute to Baji Raut, one of the bravest children
 ''on this # childrensday it's time we know about Shaheed Baji Rout ,from Nilakanthpur in Orissa ,the youngest Martyr of India's freedom struggle
 At the age of 12, this young boy was on guard of a country boat and was ordered by the British troop to ferry them across river Brahamani
 Baji who had already heard details of the brutality of the troop which had killed innocent people in the village understood if the British troops were to be obstructed,then they needed to be stopped from going across to the other bank
 He therefore refused to ferry them across
 The troop threatened to kill him if he did not ferry them across immediately
 Baji however rejected their orders
 One of the British soldiers hit Baji's head with his gun butt that fractured his skull severely 
 Baji collapsed ,, but he rose again gathering whatever little strength and courage was left with him, and raising his voice to the highest pitch beyond even his strength, warned the British troops not to ferry them till alive
 a soldier pierced his bayonet into the soft skull of Baji, Another British soldier started firing ruthlessly
 While one of the bullets hit Baji and he lay dead, his other friends Laxman Malik, Fagu Sahoo, Hrushi Pradhan & Nata Malik were also killed
 India's youngest martyr definitely deserves more recognition
 Salute to one of he bravesrt child

 During the hearing of the case, one accused named Bala Surve died while three accused were acquitted for lack of evidence

 After this Renuka said- Because Tanmay and Anurag are the employers, i am not

 Deepika Amin had confided with me as a friend when i had completed two projects with Alok Nath

 is par renuko ne jawaab diya-"main kyon maafee maangoongi? mujhe lagata he ki aap soch rahe hai ki mujhe kisi ke saath chhedchhad yaa rape na karne ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 You want me to apologize for uniting with the woman who is raising her voice against her hares

 "renuka supported TV actress Deepika Amin, who has said that everyone in the industry knows Aloknath is an alcoholic who harasses women
 iske baad retweet karte hue renuka ne likhaa he- ''mujhe yaad he ki aapane kai barason pehle yah mere saath share kiya tha

 The Army says that it killed two terrorists, while the CRPF protested and said that the claim made to take credit was wrong
 siarpief kah rahi he ki army ke jawan maukey par tab pahunche jab muthbhed khatm ho chuki thi
 According to the CRPF, the soldiers started taking selfies with the slain terrorists after reaching the spot

 The everlasting smile on his face and big eyes attract everyone's attention
 ve bhartiya televijan kii duniya kaa sabase janaa-pahachaanaa cheharaa hai
 His journey started 13 years ago with the most successful serial Kahaani ghar-ghar Ki
 ve desh ke har ghar main adarsh bahu parvati ke rup main pahachaani jane lageen
 Mothers began to love him and for every mother-in-law, she became an example of an ideal child
 aaj, phir ve bade achche lagate hai kii priya ke rup main sarvaadhik lokapriy cheharaa hai
 The first family is Sakshi, 40, from the small town of Alwar in Rajasthan, where she lived in a joint family
 lekin pita kii naukari kii vajah se un logon ko uttar bharat ke vibhinn shaharon main janaa padaa he
 She says, "our holidays used to be spent in a joint family in Alwar
 ’’ lagbhag ek dashak se sakshi mumbai main rah rahi hai or zyaadaatar samay mummy-papa unke saath rahete hai
 He has a brother and sister but feels that he has got the most love and love
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘parivaar mere liye behad ahm he
 i depend on my family from small things to big decisions
 main har roj unki salaah leti hum
 i like the whole house better than the empty wall
 usase badi madad milti he
 "witnesses don't look emotional, but they also have an emotional side
" unke bistar ke peeche diwaar par unki mummy kii tasviir tangi he
 She says, "I wake up in the morning and look at that picture and talk to them before going to sleep at night
" ve meri best friend, guru or guide hai
 His voice only frees me from all kinds of stress
 ve jab bhi mere saath hoti hai, to mere liye khaanaa banaati hai
 "marriage talk: Is there pressure on this superstar of the small screen to" settle down "by getting married? Sakshi replies with astonishment, "my mother and father like me, like my promotion
" unka maananaa he ki jab mujhe lage ki ab sahi vakt he to main shaadi kar luungi
 Sakshi remembers the time her father set up a meeting with a prospective boy and asked when she would stop working after marriage
 is par ek pal bhi ganvaae bina ve fouran boleen, ‘‘aap kab kaam chhod denge!’’ or is tarah kissa khatm ho gaya
 In speculation and Ram Kapurbade Lagte Lagte Hain, Sakshi Tanwar and Ram Kapoor are the most liked couple on screen, but there have been reports of differences between them in the media
 inkaa khandan karte hue ve kahati hai, ‘‘meri kabhi koi shikaayat nahin rahi he
 We are both professionals and we have amazing tuning on screen
 parde ke baahar bhi ham ek-duusare kaa sammaan karte hai
 Speculation of rift between us is baseless
 ’’ sakshi maanati hai ki ram ke sang kaam karnaa badhibia anubhav he
 Most of his scenes are natural, the script is left behind and we go on
 phir achaanak diarector se poochhate hai, ‘‘aap cat kab kahoge!’’ ve itnaa kho jate hai ki seen kab kaa khatm ho jaataa he unhen pataa hi nahin chalata!teraa saal se kaayam jaadusakshi ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat ekta kapur (balaji telefilm limited) ke dharawahik kahani ghar-ghar kii se kii
 Since then, 13 years have passed but their relationship remains strong even today
 haal main bade achche lagate hai kii dhansu kamyaabi se production houseej main unka rutaba phir se kaayam ho gaya he
 It is said in the industry that working with unity is not easy
 to, sakshi kaa unke saath kaisaa talmail he? ‘‘balaji ab mere parivaar kii tarah ho gaya he
 It is no longer a place where you go, work and return
 ekta profeshnal hai or unka focus apane kaam par hota he
 Yes, they do not make any concessions in terms of work, they are hard taskmaster! Why not? Anyone who works hard like them and with dedication will want
 
 
 
 If i too were in their place, i would have done the same
 agar aap kisi project yaa sho ke prati samarpit ho to aap kuch ghante lagan or puure peshewar tareeke se use kaamyaab banane main jute jaaoge
 If you do not do that and someone says something on it, then it is legitimate to say it
 ’’ lekin ve waisi nahin hai jaisi media main sakshi ke album se lee gai tasveeron se jaahir hota he
 She says, "people say that i don't go to many parties and events
 main gharelu kism kii hum, kuch aalsee bhi, jab mujhe lagata he ki maamla mahatv kaa he, tabhi jaati hum
 "most of the actor-actresses away from the race immediately seize the opportunity they had in Balaji's project again, but it took Ekta some time to persuade Sakshi to play Priya's role in Badheek Lagte Hain Hai
" sakshi kahati hai, ‘‘aath saal tak din-raat kaam karne ke baad main kuch samay bina kisi kaam ke chaiyn se bitaana chaahati thi
 As soon as i wake up in the morning, feel that there is no program or agenda for the day
 aath saal tak kahani
 
 
 i worked so much during what other people would do in 16 years because we worked every day and not a single episode was without me
 yah kahana to thik nahin he ki mujhe chhuttiyaan nahin milin lekin usamen bhi kaam kaa dabaav bana rahata tha
 i wanted to roam the streets, go for holidays, i would spend my time, i wanted to be with my family, friends, watch movies, stretch out and relax
 or maine dhai saal tak yahi kiya
 "she considers it the best decision of her life
 har roj jab kai achche maukey mil rahe hon to unhen kya yah chintaa nahin sataati thi ki nae actaron ko mauka mil jayega or staradam khatm ho jayega? sakshi sweekaar karti hai, ‘‘kuch na karne ke liye himmat to chahie
 Yes, there were doubts in my mind
 
 
 lekin main vaisaa kuch shartiya taur par nahin karnaa chaahati thi jaisaa kar chuki thi
 
 
 i was not progressing as an actor
 ’’acchhee ladki, bura rolaunhen balika vadhoo main khalanayika jaisi tipri kaa role karne ko kaha gaya to vah unke liye badi ‘‘chunauti’’ thi
 "I thought it would be an important job for me as an actor," Sakshi tells of that unique experience
 yah mere pehle role se 180 degree ulat tha
 This gave me a good chance but i also realized that i need to improve my acting
 ’’ haalanki sakshi kaa iske pehle role (kahani ghar ghar kii main) itnaa sakaaratmak or preranadayak-bilkul gaoo samaan-tha ki unka nayaa avatar darshakon ko pasand nahin aayaa
 He did not like to see his favorite "daughter-in-law" as a villain
 lekin abhinetri sakshi kaa kahana he ki isse ve bhavishya main aisi bhoomikaayen karne se parhez nahin karengi
 On screen and in real life, two of the most popular small screen actors, Sakshi Tanwar, as Parvati and Priya in the two most popular serials of Sakshatelivision, find themselves around which character in real life? The answer immediately comes, "of course, it looks very good that Priya! People in our country are accustomed to seeing someone connected to their relationships

 First of all, good thing: Organ donation for transplant has increased in the country
 ek desh jahaan angadaan ke prati logon main badi anichhaa dekhi jaati he, vahaan angadaan main vruddhi kii khabaren sukhad hai
 While a total of 1,149 organs were donated in 2014, it increased to 2,870 in 2017
 isamen kidney or liver ke daan main ai dhai guna badhat ke saath hriday ke daan main saadhe chah guna badhat bhi shaamil he
 Now a sad news: in spite of all this, not one in ten million people in India donate organs

 The waitlist is so challenging that barely 9,000 of the 200,000 patients with kidney need a kidney
 or ek bura vivadautamilnadu main har saal kareeb 20-25 pratishat videshi hriday yaa fefde kaa pratyaropan kara rahe hai

 So what is going on? The lack of transparency in the process of receiving and transplanting organs is a major concern
 ang pratyaropan kanoon lagu karne main pakshpaat ke chalate isaki paardarshita bhi sandigdh rahi he
 The Human Organ and Tissue Transplantation Law gives the first authority over donated organs to the people of the state and country who are waiting for human organs, not foreign nationals
 lekin tamilnadu ke aankadon se yah spasht he ki aspataal or sarjan bhartiya nagarikon ke mukaable videshi nagarikon ko ang pratyaropan main praathamikta dete hai or iske peeche vyavsaayik kaarnon se puri tarah inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa

 But this is insufficient

 At the same time, he said that if the Congress wants the alliance to continue, then we will have no objection
 kumaraswami ne kaha, 'gathbandhan ke bhavishya ko lekar hamaare bich kisi prakaar kii charchaa nahin hui he
 We are independent and Congress too
 agar gathbandhan aage bhi jari rahata he yaa congress saath main milakar aage bhi kaam karnaa chaahati he to ham aage bhi saath main kaam karenge

 com / ersjavbjdh — ANI (@ANI) BJP was the largest party in the election of July 24, 2019, 2018, Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party with 104 seats in the 2018 Karnataka Assembly Elections
 vahiin, congress ko 78 siten or jedies ko 38 siten milin
 Apart from this, 2 seats were won by other parties
 sabase badi party hone ke baavjood bhaajapa sarkaar banane main asafal rahi or dekhte hi dekhte congress or jedies ne milakar satta par kabja kar liya
 The coalition government of Congress and JDS secured majority in the House and HD Kumaraswamy of JDS was made the Chief Minister of the state
 haalanki, mangalvaar ko yah sarkaar vidhansabha main vishwaas mat hasil nahin kar pai, jiske baad ek or rajya congress ke haath se nikal gaya
 In the meantime, there have also been occasions when reports of estrangement between Congress and JDS came
 haalanki, isse sarkaar par koi prabhaav nahin padaa
 Now that the coalition government has fallen, the biggest question that arises is whether the two parties running the government will remain together in the alliance
 kumaraswami kii baton se lagata he ki wo gathbandhan ke saath aage badhane ke liye taiyaar hai
 It has to be seen whether the Congress is ready for this or will it alone decide the way forward? akhil bhartiya gorkha lig (eyeeel) ke adhyaksh or gorkhaland ke jabardast pairokaar madan tamang kii darjeeling shahar main agyaat hamalaavaron ne hatya kar di

 In 1704, the Diwan of Aurangzeb, Murshid Kali Khan shifted the capital of Bengal from Daka (dhaka (now the capital of Bangladesh)) to here and named the city after himself as Murshidabad

 bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandhon main hone vaali har nai shuruyaat dhak ke teen paat hi sabit hoti he
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly arrived in Lahore on Christmas day to congratulate Nawaz Sharif on his birthday and to bless his granddaughter's wedding, it seemed to be the defining moment of the month-long relentless diplomatic exercise during which "kill enemies" From "pappi Jhappi" came many opportunities through which both countries could once again join the process of negotiation
 hafte bhar baad hi nae saal ke din yah utsaah ekadam chakanachur ho gaya jab seemaa paar se sashastr aatankwaadi pathankot ke vaayu sena thikaane main ghus gaye, haalanki ladaaku vimaanon or helicopteron ko nasht karne kii unki ghaatak koshishon ko naakaam kar diya gaya
 He was killed in a fight that lasted for 72 hours, but during this time he also put to sleep seven security personnel of India and exposed our half-preparedness to deal with such terror attacks
 iske baad desh bhar main pakistan ke vishwasghaat par ho-hallaa machana shuru ho gaya or kargil or 26 / 11 kaa jinn bottle se nikal kar baahar aa gaya, jisane modi ke saamne may, 2014 ke baad videsh niti ke maamle main pehali baar sabase kathin chunauti pesh kar di
 The end of this sequence was to be the same as the preceding script & Foreign Secretary level talks to be held in mid-january, rein in terror and mobilize international cooperation citing Pakistan's betrayal
 aise parichit utaar-chadhaavon ke baad aisa laga ki modi ko apane padosi kii manshaa kaa andaja ho chalaa tha
 Modi's critics have been calling his foreign policy lax in the context of Pakistan
 acha hi hua ki modi ne vah kaam nahin kiya jisaki ashanka thi
 Neither did he make a fist nor chest
 isaki bajaae unki sarkaar kii har pratikriya nappi-tuli or sadhi hui dikhi
 Result: Unlike the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks, Pakistan could not deny that the terrorists who attacked Pathankot were not Pakistanis
 iske baad pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar nasir khan janjua ne apane bhartiya samakaksh ajit dobhaal ko phone karke bataaya ki ve bharat ke muhaiyaa karaae kisi bhi suraag par aage karrwai karne ko taiyaar hai
 After this, Sharif, who went on a Colombo visit, called Modi and expressed concern, repeating Janjua's talk
 modi ne apane saare vikalp khule rakhe ki pakistan ke saath baatcheet main kaise or kab aage baduya he
 The important thing was that Modi now understood who and how to talk in Pakistan
 pehla sabakpakistani fouj hi asli takatsatta main aate hi modi ne apane shapath grahan samaaroh main dakshin asia ke netaaon samet sharif ko nyotaa bhejkar kootnithik jeet hasil kar lee thi or “padosiyon ko sabase pehle rakhane” kii apni niti kaa sanket de daalaa tha
 Through dialogue with Pakistan, Modi was trying to improve his radical nationalist image
 ve is baat ko lekar spasht the ki apni 3si kii niti yani contact, connactivity or kooparation ke liye pakistan ahm he, kyonki uske sahyog ke bagaiyr yah niti parwaaj nahin bhar sakati thi
 Sharif has always been supportive of improving relations with India, so Modi's invitation was an opportunity for him to restore his image domestically
 modi kii hi tarah ve bhi 2013 main baari bahumat se satta main aae the lekin unhone bhi sirf chhalane vaale vaade kiye the
 The Pakistani military was treating Sharif's third term with great caution, especially when he retaliated against former President and army chief General Pervez Musharraf, who overthrew him in 1999 and sent him into political exile in Saudi Arabia
 musharraf se badla lene ke kram main sharif ne fouj ke aalaa adhikariyon kii chetavanee ko nazarandaaj kar diya tha
 For the first time a Pakistani general was being put in the dock — which he soon had to pay
 fouj ne imran khan ko shah dekar sarkaar par hamalaa tej kar diya or siyaasi pradarshnon ke jariye sharif kii sarkaar ko bebas kar daalaa
 In November 2013, when Raheel Sharif took over the command of the army, he soon started showing his colors despite Nawaz's election
 unki chhavi ek thande dimag vaale faujee kii he jo apane kaam se khud ko sabit karata he or kam bolta he
 Raheel began to question Sharif's policy of negotiating with extremist groups opposed to Pakistani interests
 fouj ne aantarik suraksha or videsh niti ke masalon par apana prabhutv jataana shuru kar diya or sharif ko pyaar se yah jataa diya gaya ki ve chupchaap desh kii arthvyavastha ko durust karne kii ore dhyaan den
 The Pakistani army did not appreciate the invitation of Modi's swearing-in ceremony without any commitment from India on the resumed dialogue, especially in the case of Kashmir
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke kaarykaal ke aakhri dinon main bharat ne pakistan ke saath tab tak samvaad bahaali shuru karne se inkaar kar diya tha, jab tak ki vah 26 / 11 ke shadyantrkariyon par karrwai nahin karata, elosi par aksar hone vaale sangharsh viraam ke ulalanghanon par roak nahin lagaataa or sarhad par aman kaayam nahin karata
 The Pakistani army was also concerned about India's engagement in Afghanistan, which it considers to be its strategic backyard
 isiilie paak fouj ne bharat ko vahaan se duuri baratane ko chetane ke liye kashmir main dobaaraa sargarmi paidaa kar di
 The army had expressed concern that Nawaz, who had gone to Modi's swearing-in ceremony, did not meet the Hurriyat leaders
 isiilie modi ne jab agast 2014 main tatkaaleen videsh sachiv sujatha singh ko samvaad bahaali kii ranneeti banane ke liye islamabad bhejne kaa faisla kiya to pakistani fouj ne is kavayad main palitha lagane kaa faisla kar liya tha
 Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit was asked to invite the Hurriyat leaders so that they could be consulted on the Kashmir issue and could be raised at the Foreign Secretary level talks
 hurriyat se ateet main bhi baat hoti rahi thi or pakistan se aane vaale adhiktar afasar unke saath samvaad karte rahe the
 While Modi and his National Security Advisor Ajit Doval did not realize this, the Congress also began to criticize him for his soft approach to Pakistan
 samvaad kii prakriya main hurriyat ko tisare paksh ke rup main ghusaane kaa aarope islamabad par lagaate hue modi ne videsh sachiv str kii vaarta achaanak radd kar di
 For Sharif, the cancellation of the talks was a personal blow as he came to India at Modi's swearing in and played a big political bet
 pakistani fouj ke liye haalanki yah ek jeet ke jaisaa tha, kyonki usne apane sabase bade dushman desh ke saath apni naagarik sarkaar ko samvaad kii prakriya main jane or is tarah varchasv hasil karne se roak liya tha
 The cancellation of the conversation may have earned Modi applause within his right-wing camp, but there was an atmosphere of panic among international forces over the incident
 unhen laga ki modi ne shuruyaat to acchhee kii thi lekin bich main ve rasta bhatak rahe the
 In the coming months, Modi realized that it was an easy step to cancel the conversation
 uski bajaae baatcheet ko dobaaraa shuru karnaa kaaphi mushkil kaam tha or pakistani fouj se nibatna kahin zyada kathin tha
 The second issue was the first issue for Pakistan, when Kashmiri Marmodi spoke to Sharif in Kathmandu during the SAARC summit in November 2014, when the relations had not melted
 jammu-kashmir ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke khatm hone ke baad pehali baar kaayade se modi ne samvaad bahaali kii prakriya kaa eemaandaar prayaas shuru kiya
 Pakistan did not make any serious attempt to disrupt the assembly elections because it was confident that Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and his party PDP would come to power with a clear majority
 said ne pakistan ke saath rishton ke pul banane kii jarurat par baat kii thi or islamabad unhen apane sahyogi ke bataur dekh rahaa tha
 It happened that the PDP was captured in the valley but BJP won in Jammu
 pakistan kii apeksha se ulat rajya ke itihaas main pehali baar march, 2015 main pidipi or bijepi kii saajha sarkaar satta main ai jisase modi sarkaar ko rajya ke masalon main zyada dakhsandaji kii chhot mili or pakistan se nibatane main bharat kaa haath majboot ho gaya
 Foreign Secretary S
 just after the assembly elections
 jaishankar aupchaarik rup se saarc yatra ke naam par islamabad chale gaye lekin unka asli uddeshy vahaan ke maahaul ko jaananaa tha
 India's precondition was that it is ready for the restoration of dialogue, but first the 26 / 11 conspirators should be acted upon, peace is maintained on the border and terror is stopped
 modi sarkaar ke liye yah kram zyada ahm tha-pehle aatankwaad par baat honi thi
 Only after this, other issues including Kashmir could be discussed
 aise main bada mauka tab aayaa jab pichley saal july main rus ke upha main shanghai kooparation orgenigeshan summit kii baithak ke dauraan modi or navaj kii mulaakaat hui or donon vaarta shuru karne ko raji ho gaye
 In the process, the security advisors of both the countries had to first discuss terrorism in Delhi, after which the foreign secretaries had to decide together how to proceed on other issues including Kashmir
 yahaan jari sanyukt bayaan main kashmir kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya
 When Nawaz returned to the country, the army chief expressed his disappointment on this
 iske baad pakistan apane vaadon se peeche hatane laga or yah saaf ho chukaa tha ki vah kisi na kisi tareeke se is prakriya ko khatm karnaa chahta tha
 He demanded that the Foreign Secretary also meet as well and added that National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz would first meet Hurriyat
 upha kii prakriya bekaar sabit ho gai or yah jhatka modi ko sharmasaar karne vaala sabit hua
 After this, another opportunity came when Modi and Nawaz arrived in New York at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September
 bhartiya madhyasthon ne pakistani samakakshon se baat kii
 Sartaj agreed to meet Aziz Doval but at the same time he also wanted to meet External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 bharat ne isamen roda atka diya or prayaas vifal ho gaya
 One official says, India felt that "aziz was not as willing or creative to move towards a solution
" ”iske baad pakistan ne ek ahm badlaav karte hue janjua ko suraksha salaahkaar bana diya
 Janjua is a former commander of the army, who has dealt with the rebels of Balochistan
 unhen raahil or navaj donon kaa bharosa hasil he
 This could also bring the Pakistani army to the negotiating table with India
 iske baad paris main jab donon rashtradhyaksh jalwaayu parivartan sammelan main gaye hue the, modi ne pahalakadami kii
 In a two-minute conversation with Nawaz in the lounge, Modi told him that Sushma Swaraj would go to the Heart of Asia conference in Islamabad and discuss dialogue restoration there, but before that both security advisors should meet
 sharif raji ho gaye or hafte bhar ke bheetar donon suraksha salaahkaar dilli kii media se dur or hurriyat se mulaakaat ke masale se bachane ke liye bangkok main mili
 Both foreign secretaries were also present, but Jaishankar had made it clear that he was present as an aide to both the chief negotiators
 donon suraksha salaahkaar chaar ghante tak baat karte rahe
 During this, Doval spoke the most
 unhone bharat kii chintaaon se avgat karaayaa or yah spasht kiya ki bharat ke paas pakistan or aatankiyon ke rishte par karrwai karne laayak paryaapt saboot uplabdh hai
 Janjua said that Pakistan itself is facing terror attacks and assured Doval of all kind of cooperation
 sushamaa swaraj jab pakistan pahunchin, to unka jabardast swaagat kiya gaya or sharif ne apane parivaar se unhen milwaaya
 Both countries agreed to restore the overall bilateral dialogue process to resolve all pending issues, including Kashmir
 bharat “dwipaksheeya” shabd ko isamen daalana chahta tha taaki pakistan ko bhavishya main ise tripaksheeya banane or tisare paksh ke bataur hurriyat ko isamen ghusaane se roka ja sake
 Pakistan succeeded in bringing Kashmir to the negotiating table without giving evidence that it was trying to stop terrorism
 modi kii auchak lahore yatra ne is prakriya ko or shashakt karne kaa kaam kiya
 It was such an informal step of diplomacy that was not only a gift to Nawaz but also came out of Modi's exercise to improve the image in Pakistan
 teesraa sabakpakistan ekarup ikai nahinpathankot kaa hamalaa is baat kaa spasht sanket he ki pakistan ekarup ikai nahin he balki vahaan ek se zyada aantarik paksh hai jinase bharat ko nibatna he or unhen sambodhit karnaa he
 The attack was not in response to Modi's visit to Lahore, but rather it was planned months ago
 iske alaava aise hamalon kaa ek chalan bhi beete kuch varshon ke dauraan ubhar kar aayaa he
 The more serious the engagement, the more violent the provocation will be in the form of a terrorist attack
 is tarj par dekhen to 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii aitihaasik lahore yatra ke baad pakistani fouj kaa hamalaa hua
 During the tenure of Manmohan Singh, when much progress had been made in the alternative negotiations, the 26 / 11 attack pushed the negotiations back years
 pathankot hamale ke baad modi sarkaar ne jo bayaan jari kiye, ve dikhaate hai ki bharat kuch sharton ke saath apana samvaad jari rakhega
 This is a good sign as the resumption of dialogue process and Modi's visit to Lahore has already strengthened India's image internationally and is also reaping benefits
 pehle jab bharat pakistan ke aatanki hamalon kii shikaayat karata tha tab badi takatein samvaad prakriya ke abhaav ko ginawati thim
 After Pathankot, all countries have sympathized with India and have pressured Pakistan to take action
 sawaal uthta he ki aise hamalon ko bardaasht karne kii bharat kii had kya ho? kya aglaa koi hamalaa samvaad kii prakriya ko tod degaa? ashanka he ki aatankwaadi shanti prakriya ko baadha pahunchane ke liye naram lakshyon par prahaar karenge
 Pak army will continue to support all terrorist groups secretly
 shuruaati jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki pathankot kaa hamalaa lashkar ne nahin, jaish-e-mohammad ne kiya tha
 As one expert says, it is a slippery situation for India - whether we take any action or not, we have to face condemnation in both the cases
 ham chupchaap baith gaye to iskaa matlab yah hua ki hamane haar maan lee
 If we increase the tension, it will cause havoc for both the countries
 jaisaaki sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, “jang kaa vikalp nahin he
 "especially because both countries are nuclear power
 modi ko apni is aalochana par bhi dhyaan dena hoga ki pakistan ko lekar unki koi sthir niti nahin he
 Experts believe that in his own way, Modi goes along with formulating the policy, he is impulsive and provocative, and by acting with grandeur, he believes that this style is the only element
 ve unhen aise salaahkaaron ko viksit karne kii salaah dete hai jo gati avarohak kii bhoomika nibhaa saken taaki modi rakrataar ke chakkar main bich main hi na ladkadaa jaaen
 Apart from this, they should also avoid retreating every time with their footsteps and continue to engage, whatever the provocation
 satark rahane ke kuch or kaaran bhi hai
 For example, Raheel Sharif has emerged very powerful in Pakistan
 karachi main niyam kanoon lagu karne or phata kshetron main aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf apane kadam se ve kaaphi lokapriy ho chuke hai
 America and other forces acknowledge their ability
 vaishvik takatein afghanistan kii sthirataa ke liye pakistan ko ahm maan rahi hai or yahi baat raahil sharif kii takat ko badhaati he
 In view of its plan of economic corridor, China is investing a lot of money in Pakistan
 arthvyavastha durust dikh rahi he or navaj sharif ne apane fouj pramukh ke saath ek santulan saadh liya he
 Therefore, Pakistan's credibility has increased and he believes that to date he has the power to negotiate with India
 bharat se baatcheet fouj ke paksh ko vaidhata detii he or use nape-tule tareeke se tanaav kaayam rakhane kii chhot detii he
 Despite this, there are many other forces in Pakistan which work against this objective which India should recognize and exploit
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bharat ko ab vivaadon kaa nibatara hone tak ek aisi antarim vyavastha kerani chahie jo pakistan ke saath uske rishton ko ek pariprekshya main rakh sake
 The Modi government does not believe in behind-the-scenes negotiations, but the quiet diplomacy at the NSA level in Bangkok has been helpful to it
 fouj tanaav ko banaae rakhana chaahati he taaki pakistan main uski apni sthiti sudrudh rahe or bharat ke ubhaar ko roka ja sake
 India will have to keep its mood cold and not take extreme action until it becomes very mandatory
 modi sarkaar ko sadhi hui pratikriya deni hogi taaki har baithak se vah adhiktam parinaam nikaal sake
 For example, Vajpayee made certain promises to Musharraf before going to the SAARC summit in Islamabad in 2004
 modi ko is saal saarc sammelan main jane se pehle aise hi aashwaasan hasil kar lene honge
 Modi's policy of giving preference to neighbors is on the right track and his resolve to keep them in dialogue is also firm
 modi ne pakistan se nibatane main khulaapan or lacheelaapan dikhaaya he jiskaa shrey unhen diya janaa chahie
 This gives them several options to deal with an unexpected neighbor
 jaisaaki ek aalaa adhikari ne kaha he, “iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ham deele pad jaaenge yaa kathor karrwai nahin karenge
 If a country messes with us, it has to be ready for an answer
 ” The controversy is deepening over the statement of All India Majlis-e Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Chief and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi
 ab ovaisi ke bayaan par bhartiya janata party ke netaa madhav bhandari ne kaha he ki unhen soch-samajhakar bolnaa chahie
 Not only this, Bhandari went on to say that if Owaisi spoke the language of the stake, the share was given in 1947
 centre main duusari baar prachand bahumat se modi sarkaar aane ke baad asaduddin ovaisi lagaataar pratikriya de rahe hai
 In this episode, he has said that if someone is understanding that the PM of India will win the 300 seats arbitrarily on the country, it cannot happen
 ovaisi ne yah bhi kaha he ki ham hindustan ko aabaad rakhenge, ham yahaan par baraabar ke hakdaar hai, kirayedar nahin hai hissedaar rahenge
 This statement by the BJP leader has given a response to this statement of Owaisi by Maharashtra BJP leader Madhav Bhandari
 unhone na sirf ovaisi ko soch-samajhakar bolne kii naseehat di he, balki aazaadee ke baad bharat ke bantwaare se bane pakistan kii bhi yaad dilaa di he
 Responding to Owaisi, Bhandari said, 'nobody called him a tenant, but if he spoke the language of the stake, he gave the stake in 1947, then the matter was over
 'loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bijepi kii jeet ke baad piem modi ne alpsankhyakon ke saath chal or unhen bhaybheet rakhane kii baat kahi thi, jis par pratikriya dete hue ovaisi ne poocha tha ki agar piem ko lagata he musalmaan dar main rahete hai, to kya vah un girohon ko rokenge, jo gaay ke naam par musalamaanon kii hatya kar rahe hai
 After this statement, Owaisi said while talking about the Muslims of the country that he is not a tenant, but will remain as a shareholder
 ovaisi ke isi bayaan par bhandari ne kaha he ki unhen koi kirayedar nahin bataa rahaa he, lekin hissedari 1947 main di di gai he
