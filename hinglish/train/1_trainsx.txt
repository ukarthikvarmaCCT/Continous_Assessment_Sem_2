 He said that the CAG had audit rights under sections 149, 150 and 151 of the Constitution
 joshi ke mutabik kaig ko teen tarah kii audit ke adhikaar hai jinamein vittiya audit, anupaalan (compliance) or pradarshan (parformens) audit hai
 Only CA can do financial audit
 unhone kaha ki 13 june 2006 ko ek sarkari aadesh main bhi kaig ko is tarah ke adhikaar hone kii baat kahi gai thi jab bhi samprag sarkaar satta main thi
 Joshi said that all the ministries of the government are nervous about the performance audit of the CAG as this will open their raw letter, hence the government and the Congress party are targeting the CAG
 unhone kaha ki kaig, piesi tathaa press desh main javabdehi or paardarshita ke liye kaam karte hai lekin bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne vaali aisi sabhi sansthaaon par sarkaar hamalaa kar rahi he
 He said that the government does not want corruption cases to come out before the public, hence the efforts of people like Anna Hazare, Baba Ramdev are also tried
 joshi ne kaha ki sarkaar loktantr ko khatm karnaa chaahati he or vah taanaashaahee kii ore bad rahi he
 He said that the Congress Party and the government should clarify whether they agree with such serious statements of party members on these constitutional bodies and if not, what action will be taken against them
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon kaa daman karnaa bahut khatarnaak sanket he or yadi sarkaar aise hi chalegi to desh main jo bhi aakrosh penpega uski jimmedaar vahi hogi
 Referring to the growing economic crisis in the US, Joshi said that today we raised the issue in Parliament and other opposition parties also believe that the government should be cautious and the foundation of economic policies should be reviewed
 unhone is mudde par sansad main charchaa karaane kii bhi maang doharaai
 He said that although life cannot exist in the present surface of Mars

 One must have seen the common man pleading before the officials and leaders for justice, but it is a bit surprising when a leader asks for justice for himself in a full assembly
 somvaar ko uttar pradesh kii vidhansabha main kuch aisa hi dekhne ko mila jab sapa vidhayak kalpanaath paswan vidhansabha main foot-footkar rone lage
 He folded his hands and sought justice for the speaker present there
 upi vidhansabha kaa bajet satr chal rahaa he or tamaam dalon ke netaa sadan kii kaarywahi main shaamil hone ke liye pahunche hue the
 Then Kalpnath Paswan, an MLA from Azamgarh's hardworking, stood up from his seat and shouted loudly
 darasal unki shikaayat uttar pradesh police se thi jo unki FIR darj nahin kar rahi he
 a few days ago, a million rupees were stolen from his car, but the police have not registered any FIR in this case so far
 vidhayak ne yahi shikaayat bhare sadan ke saamne doharaai or yah bayaan karte hue vah sadan main foot-footkar rone lage
 He said 'do justice to me
 mujhe agar nyaay nahin mila to main nishchit rup se mar jaaoongaa
 Today i am crying in the House, tomorrow the whole House will cry
 'paisa dilava do, nahin to mar jaaoongaa
 
 
 Addressing the speaker, Paswan said, 'let justice be done
 main puure sadan se haath jodakar vinati kar rahaa hum
 Where do i go main puure sadan se kah rahaa hum, manyavar main jinda nahin rahoonga
 Manyavar, i am a poor farmer
 meraa rupaya dilava dijie, varna main mar jaaoongaa
 He folded both his hands while saying this
 vidhayak kii yah sthiti dekh sadan main unke saath baithe vidhayak ne unka dhankos badhaayaa or paswan se baith jane kii apil kii
 At the same time, the speaker also expressed his condolences on behalf of the House
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vidhayak kalpanaath paswan ne apana ghar banavaane ke liye bank se yah paisa nikaala tha
 But on January 7, Azamgarh thieves disappeared from their suitcases full of notes
 iske baad vidhayak ne apni shikaayat police main darj karaani chaahi lekin police ne ab tak is maamle main koi shikaayat nahin likhi he

 The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh had already asked to mark illegal Bangladeshis while assuming power, but the exercise could not take off
 ab bangladeshiyon or rohingya musalamaanon kii pahchaan ke liye baqayda abhiyaan chalaaya jayega

 ab nae sire se isaki shuruyaat karne ke liye dijipi mukhyalay kii taraf se sabhi jilon ke captainon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki bade paimaane par vah avaidh bangladeshiyon kaa survey karakar unhen chinhit karen
 Whatever documents they have related to their identity should be examined, so that it is clear how illegal Bangladeshi are living here and what action can be taken against them

 These people do small jobs here, which include garbage, cleaning of houses and doing small business
 khufia sutron ke mutabik, inamen se tamaam avaidh bangladeshi kai tarah ke aparaadhon main bhi shaamil rahe hai
 Many times information is available about the Bangladeshis living on the basis of fake documents, who have been involved in many kinds of robberies and criminal incidents
 jaankaree ke mutabik, uttar pradesh main saikadon kii sankhya main rohingya musalmaan bhi rah rahe hai
 However, the government has not yet decided about any of these

 In a news channel these topics are discussed apart from speed news? Do their parents value these subjects? What have they been watching on TV? Answer it honestly

 There has been a debate from the Human Rights Commission to the Supreme Court to send Rohingya Muslims back to Myanmar
 maanavadhikaar ayog ke kaarykram main jahaan grahamantri rajnath singh ne saaf kaha ki rohingya musalamaanon ko waapas unke desh bheja hi jayega
 Because the citizens of the country have the first and proper right over the resources of the country
 khufia report bhi inaki sandigdh gatividhiyon kii tasdik karti hai
 To this, the chairman of the Human Rights Commission, Justice HL Dattu replied that the commission would go to the Supreme Court in support of the human rights of Rohingya Muslims
 pakshakaar bhi banegaa or ye bhi kahegaa ki waapas bhejne se pehle inke jivan kii suraksha sunishchit kii jaae
 The West Bengal Child Rights Protection Commission pleaded in the Supreme Court that the children and their mothers of Rohingya Muslims should not be sent back in view of the current violent situation in Myanmar
 ayog kii adhyaksh ananyaa chakravarti kii ore se court main daakhil yachika main kaha gaya ki rajyabar main rohingya bastiyon ke alaava 44 bachche shelter home or sudhaar grihon main rah rahe hai
 Of these, 24 children are living in the shelter home and 20 in the correctional home
 bacchon kii maanon ko avaidh rup se bharat main rahane ke aarope main sudhaar gharon main rahanaa pad rahaa he
 He said that so far no survey of children living in Rohingya settlements of the state has been conducted
 chakravarti nerohingya musalamanonke paksh main yah bhi kaha ki bachche aatankwaadi nahin balki bhavishya hai
 It is not fair to push the entire community into the face of death because of some people's activities
 myanmar ke maujuuda halaat main bacchon ko waapas bhejnaa maut ke munh main dhakelne jaisaa hoga
 The court has also decided to hear the case on 3 October along with the original matter

 a five-member constitution bench of the Gujarat High Court rejected the state government's argument that the scheme was discriminatory, with a vote of three against two

 After this, the matter has started on political turmoil
 neshnal green tribunel (engiti) ne vimaan se maanav mel giraane ke maamle main naagarik vimaanan mahanideshaalay (dijisie) kii fatkaar lagaai he
 The NGT said the DGCA has repeatedly disobeyed the circular to ensure that the airline's aircraft operated at Indira Gandhi Airport do not empty the toilet tank during the flight
 engiti adhyakshanyymurti adarsh kumaar goyal kii aguwai vaali peeth ne shuukravaar ko chetavanee di ki agar is aadesh kaa 31 agast tak anupaalan nahin kiya gaya to nagar vimaanan mahanideshak kii selary roak di jaaegi
 The Green Tribunal expressed strong displeasure that despite its explicit order, no explanation was given nor complied with by the aviation regulator on the issue
 nyaayamurti goyal or nyaayamurti jaavad rahim kii peeth ne kaha ki dijisie dwaara na koi vaid spashtikaran diya gaya or na hi aadesh kaa anupaal kiya gaya
 In such a situation, we have no option but to direct the DGCA to follow these instructions by 31 August
 sunwaayee ke dauraan dijisie ne kaha ki aadesh kaa ab tak isliye paalan nahin kiya gaya kyonki engiti ke aadesh ke khilaaf samiksha yachika daayar he
 Explain that the DGCA had sought adjournment and review on the order dated December 20, 2016 and January 10, claiming that it was impossible to dump sewage from the aircraft's toilet during the flight
 gauratlab he ki oktober 2016 main dilli nivasee leftinent general (sevanivruth) satvant singh dahia ne maamla darj kar aarope lagaaya tha ki unke ilaake ke makaan raat main airlinon dwaara vimaanon se mel daalane ke kaaran kshatigrast ho gaye hai
 In December 2016, the NGT directed the DGCA to issue a directive to the airlines to pay a fine of Rs 50,000 if their aircraft were found dumping sewage and waste during the flight
 nyaay vyavastha main bhrashtachar ko lekar ek behad ahm maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court main ek din pehle naatakeey ghatnakram dekhne ko mila
 The matter actually started with a sting done by India Today
 india today dwaara isi saal 3 agast ko prasaarit kiye gaye is sting oparation ke jariye khulaasa hua ki kaise supreme court dwaara pravesh lene se pratibandhit kar die gaye medical college paryaapt infrastracchar na hone ke baavjood medical students ko daakhila de rahe hai
 At the same time, the Ministry of Health heard these medical colleges on the orders of the Supreme Court
 is sunwaayee main shaamil kuch medical colegeindia today ke sting ke ghere membhi the
 But after this, efforts were made to hang the case and finally the case reached the seven-member bench of the Supreme Court, in which the petitioner is being represented by eminent lawyer Prashant Bhushan
 sting se khulaase ke baad CBI ne ek nami tivi patrkaar ke padosi ke ghar par chhapemari kii
 The journalist entered the house during the raid
 in patrkaar mahoday ke kuch medical collejon or swasthya mantralay ke adhikariyon ke bich madhyasth hone kii baat bhi saamne ai
 These journalists were not named in the FIR lodged against the accused in the case, but they had to lose their jobs
 FIR main swasthya mantralay ke agyaat adhikariyon ko namdarj kiya gaya
 Conversations between some powerful people in power, middlemen and medical college owners were taped, through which some leaders were also suspected of involvement in the case
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil ek rajyamantri ko vittiya aniyamitata ke aaropon ke chalate pad se hataa diya gaya
 However, the CBI later denied having any evidence against these ministers
 lekin maamle ne kareeb ek maheene nayaa mode liya or nyaayik araajaktaa ujagar hui
 a medical college appealed to the bench hearing the case to withdraw the case
 chif justise deepak mishra ne sahmati bhi de di, lekin ek shart ke saath ki medical college shiksha satr 2017-18 main medical students ko pravesh dene kii kisi anya adaalat se ijaajat nahin maangenge
 The judge of Lucknow High Court granted permission to the medical college, despite the Cavity of Justice, the medical college appealed to the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court
 lakhanu khandpeeth ke ek jaj ne chif justise dwaara jari kaivit ke baavjood medical college ko students ko pravesh dene kii ijaajat de di
 CBI sources claim that medical college was allowed to take admission by taking a bribe
 haalanki CBI adhikariyon ne yah bataane se inkaar kar diya ki ijaajat dene vaale lakhanu khandpeeth ke jaj ke khilaaf chhapemari kii ijaajat chif justise se lee gai thi yaa chif justise ne ijaajat dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The CBI also did not state that PE was actually filed against the said judge
 lekin ek cheez yah hui ki ijaajat dene vaale jaj kaa lakhanu se elahabaad tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 The CBI then conducted a raid at a retired judge of the Odisha High Court, assuring the medical college managers to get the verdict from the Supreme Court
 sutron ke mutabik jaj ne iske liye supreme court main apane ucch padasth sampark sutron kaa istemaal karne kii koshish kii
 At the same time, the lawyer associated with the case, Prashant Bhushan, says that if the CBI has evidence then why did the medical college have to withdraw its petition from the Supreme Court
 CBI ne virodh kyon nahin kiya?agar is maamle kii sunwaayee saarvajanik taur par hoti he to CBI ko bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab dene honge
 The question is if the CBI had strong evidence against the judge then why did it not oppose the lower court granting him bail
 isamen bhi rochak baat yah he ki aaropee nyaayadhish ke saath giraftaar kiye gaye sah-aropiyon ko jamaanat nahin di gai
 While the Supreme Court reprimanded the bench of Justice j Chelameswar disqualified from hearing the case, allowing the admission of medical college by a lower court in defiance of the Supreme Court order, reflects judicial anarchy

 In his brief speech in the Assembly after voting against the introduction of Jan Lokpal Bill, the Chief Minister had said, 'this seems to be our last session
 agar mujhe bhrashtachar ko samaapt karne ke liye mukhyamantri ke pad ko 1,000 baar bhi qurbaan karnaa pade or jaan bhi deni pade, to main khud ko bhaagyashaalee maanoonga

 After pressure from the opposition party BJP and the Congress supporting the government from outside in the House, the speaker read the letter of the Lieutenant Governor to the House, which advised not to introduce this bill
 iske baad vipaksh uparajyapal kii chitthee ko lekar voting kii maang karata rahaa, jabaki dilli sarkaar is mudde par charchaa karaane ko lekar baar-baar aagrah karti najar ai
 However, later the speaker asked the Chief Minister to present the bill and allowed it to be discussed

 Delhi Pradesh Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely said in the House that we are ready to support the bill if it is brought in accordance with the Constitution
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ko balahath chhodani chahie
 At the same time, Leader of Opposition Harsh Vardhan said that Kejriwal should not spread lies in the country
 hamane kabhi bhi janalokapal kaa virodh nahin kiya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been at the forefront in supporting and implementing it
 darasal, janalokapal bill ko lekar centre or dilli sarkaar aamane-saamne hai
 The Union Law and Justice Ministry has also made it clear that without the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs, this bill cannot be introduced in the Assembly
 aam aadmi party ko samarthan de rahi congress or mukhya vipakshi dal bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki ve sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii avhelnaa bardaasht nahin karenge
 Kejriwal had said that the AAP government is ready to extend the current session beyond February 16 and will ensure the passage of the bill, but in the event of its not being passed, they will have no other option but to resign
 kejariwal ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha, ham satr main vistaar ke liye taiyaar hai
 We are not here to save the government
 unhone kaha, ham janalokapal vidheyak or swaraj vidheyak ke liye patibaddh hai tathaa bharat se bhrashtachar hataane ke liye main mukhyamantri pad 100 baar qurbaan karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 He alleged that BJP and Congress have joined hands to not allow the functioning of the House on the issue of resignation of Law Minister Somnath Bharti
 kejariwal ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki bharat ke itihaas main kisi vidhansabha main aisa hua hoga ki bhaajapa or congress ekajute ho gai ho

 Vacancies for Assistant Treasury and Accountant were taken out by the Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Services Selection Commission from 2016, after which the examination was taken, as there was a provision for interview at that time, so the interview was also done, that interview system would be introduced as soon as the new government comes in 2017

 mujhe pataa he ki aap niyukti nahin denge tab bhi ye noujvaan aapaki party ko hi vot denge
 So should they be punished? meri raay main inhen naukari milani chahie

 Khara alleged that there was a big scam in the contract allocation and Rana Gurjit Singh secured the mining contract through his four former employees with his own money
 tippaniyan Khara also displayed the income tax return of Singh's former cook Amit Bahadur to the media
 unhone kaha ki ritern ke anusaar unki masik aamadani kareeb 11,700 rupye thi

 aap netaa ne kaha ki unhone mantri ke khilaaf jaanch kii maang karte hue punjab satarkta beuro pramukh ko patr likhaa he
 AAP MLA Sukhpal Khara said that if no action is taken against the minister, the party leaders will sit on a dharna outside the Chief Minister's residence on May 30
 khara ne aarope lagaaya ki theka aavanton main bada ghotaalaa hua he or rana gurjeet singh ne apane paison se apane chaar purv karmchaariyon ke jariye khanan theka hasil kiya
 The comments khara ne singh ke purv rasoiyaa amit bahadur kaa iskar ritern bhi media ke saamne pradarshit kiya
 He said that according to the returns his monthly income was around 11,700 rupees
 unhone sawaal kiya ki aise main vah 26 karod rupye main khanan theka kaise hasil kar sakate hai
 The AAP leader said that he has written a letter to the Punjab Vigilance Bureau chief demanding an inquiry against the minister

 can contact at england ke captain elestare cook ke lords par duusare cricket test main 95 ran se shikast jhelane ke baad aalochak bhale hi unhen hataane kii maang kar rahe hon, lekin cook ne kaha ki duusare test main bharat ke khilaaf 95 ranon se haar ke baavjood vah is vakt captaini chhodane ko icchhuk nahin hai
 India created history by making a Test match after 28 years on the 'mecca of cricket' Lords
 mahendra singh dhoni kii aguwai vaali team ne 95 ran kii jeet se paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa main 1-0 se badhat bana lee
 India have recorded their first win in a Test match in 28 years at Lord's ground
 isse kapil dev kii team ne june 1986 main paanch wicket se jeet darj kar yah uplabdhi hasil kii thi
 Cook said after the match was over, it was a tough defeat
 mujhe lagata he ki hamen bharat ko kaaphi zyada shrey dena hoga, unhone hamen ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon main post kiya
 England won the toss despite losing the toss on the grassy pitch of Lord's
 unhone pich ke bare main kaha, pichhali pari main bhi, pich turn le rahi thi or oochaal le rahi thi, yahaan toss jeetna acha tha, lekin iskaa shrey bharat ko dena chahie, unhone behtareen khel dikhaaya
 England's senior players are not performing according to their records, while the youngsters have played well
 cook ne ise khilaadiyon ke aatmavishvaas kaa mudda bataaya
 He said, it is definitely a matter of confidence
 hamaari team aise khilaadiyon kaa samooh he, jo england ke liye jeet hasil karne ko betaab he
 Our young players have done well, which is good for English cricket
 haa, senior khilaadi apane record ke mutabik nahin khel rahe hai, jisamen main bhi shaamil hum
 i also have to score
 cook ne mat praayar kii tarif karte hue kaha, usamen apaar pratibha he
 At the moment i think he is the best wicketkeeper batsman in the country
 unhone team main jagah banane kii chunauti ke bare main kaha, prayek khilaadi ko team main apni jagah hasil kerani padati he or praayar ‘fiter’ he
 You would like to have such a player in your dressing room
 ant main cook thode bhavuk ho gaye or vah balle se pradarshan nahin kar paane se bhi dukhi dikhe
 He said, i was doing everything to change this result
 lekin iske liye sabase pehle mujhe ran banane shuru karne honge
 i have not been able to perform with the bat for some time, but as captain i have won a few matches
 pakistan main mangalvaar ko jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya masood ajahar ke bhai samet desh main anya pratibandhit sanghathanon se jude 44 logon ko hiraasat main le liya gaya
 Pakistan's Home Ministry has taken this action based on the decision taken in a high-level meeting on the National Action Plan on 4 March
 lekin puraane ghatnakramon par najar daalen to pakistan vaishvik dabaav main duniya ko dikhaane ke liye is tarah kii karrwai pehle bhi karata rahaa he
 Pakistan's Minister of State for Internal Affairs Shaharyar Afridi said that on March 4, a meeting of the National Security Committee held a high-level meeting on the National Action Plan in which representatives of governments of all provinces took part
 is baithak main pratibandhit sanghathanon ke khilaaf karrwai main teji laane kaa faisla hua
 Under which 44 members of banned organizations including Maulana Masood Azhar's brother Hamad Azhar and Sala Mufti Rauf Asgar have been detained
 darasal pakistan kii sarkaar par duniya bhar main aatanki funding par nigaraanee karne vaale sanghathan financial ection task force (FATF) kii agali samiksha baithak main aatank ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai kaa byora prastut karne kaa dabaav he
 Earlier on Monday, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry had issued an order to seize the assets of other banned organizations including jamaat-ud-dawa and falah-e-insaniyat Foundation, the organization of 26 / 11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed
 haalanki yah pehali baar nahin hua he jab pakistan ne vaishvik dabaav main is tarah kii karrwai kii ho
 Earlier, after the attack on Parliament in 2001, the Pakistan government banned jaish-e-mohammed
 iske baavjood jaish kaa mukhiya khuleam pakistan main bharat virdohi gatividhiyon main sanlipt rahaa
 Not only this, after the Mumbai attack, the Pakistan government had sealed the bases of jamaat-ud-dawa and lashkar-e-taiba, but they reopened within a month
 jabaki lashkar ke mukhiya hafiz said ko 26 / 11 hamale ke baad ab tak teen baar najarband kiya ja juka he
 Yet Hafiz Saeed's declaration of war against India and provoking people for jihad did not diminish
 yahi nahin janvari 2016 ko punjab ke pathankot airbase par hamale ke baad bhi pakistan ne masood ajahar, uske bhai or anya aatankiyon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 But he was later released
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale kii jimmedaari masood ajahar ke sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne hi lee thi
 Mufti Rauf Asghar is the same person who rallied in Karachi on 5 February and threatened to launch a fidayeen attack on India
 pulavama hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan sarkaar ko jaish se sambandhit jo dogier saunpe hai usamen 5 farvari ko pakistan ke vibhinn hisson main hui jaish kii reliyon kaa zikr he
 It is noteworthy that Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Kasuri has admitted in an interview to an English channel that Jaish's chief Masood Azhar is currently in Pakistan where he is undergoing treatment
 likhi thi kismat main jo bhi khushiyaan, tejaab ne sab jala diya,chhupaae phirti hum apana cheharaa ki jaise koi gunaah kiya he
 i do not understand what it is like, i am scared, i have scared the mirror or the mirror
 hamaari duniya main he andhera hamen nahin he malaal uskaa,chiraag dil kaa buja ke hamane chiraag dil kaa jala diya he
 The ruling is that the result of patience of Maula Patience will be strange, so Tuba has put the aspirations to sleep
 tu jitkar bhi na jeet paaya
 
 
 i could not lose even after losing
 beshak ye padhakar noummid ke andhere main ummid kii roshni jaagti he, aisi hi ek roshni he tuba tabassum
 Many mountains of troubles were broken in his life, but facing them, he found his destination or even today his struggle continues without
 ve acid atake kii maar jhel chuki hai, jiske baad bhi unhone haal hi bihar board se 12veen board exam main 70 fisadi number hasil kiye hai
 Who is Tuba Tabassum: This name is special today because to destroy them, the spirits threw acid on them
 tejaab girane se beshak unka cheharaa pigal gaya lekin unke hausale nahin
 The attack took place on 26 September 2012
 ve apane ghar se subah tution padhane ja rahi thi, tabhi saath padhane vaale ladke ne naaraazgi ke chalate un par acid phenk diya
 Tabassum's mistake was that she did not want to talk to the boy
 is jurm ko anjaam dene vaale bhale hi jail main hai unhen is haadase ko jindagi bhar jhelana he
 The success was also met with success, Batsum shared a lot of his life experiences in an India Today talk
 apni safalataa par unka kahana tha ki mujhe padhai ke dauraan tamaam dikkatein ain, phir bhi maine 70 fisadi number hasil kiye hai

 1999 kii baat he
 At that time i was studying in Cuttack
 hostal main rahata tha
 On 28 October, i came to the village
 gaanv main lakshmi puja chal rahi thi or lakshmi puja ke liye sabhi bachche milakar gaanv main naatak karne vaale the
 i also got a roll
 shaam ko theatre ke liye gaanv ke sab bachche reharsal kar rahe the
 Little was known about Cyclone but no one knew what the effect would be
 gaanv ke skool main naatak ke liye reharsal chal rahi thi tab dhire-dhire barish or hawa bahna shuru hui
 Gradually the speed of rain and wind kept increasing
 reharsal band hua or sabhi bachche ghar chale gaye
 Everyone thought that the air will gradually reduce, then the next day rehearsal will begin
 ham jitne bhi bachche the kisi ko bhi super cyclone ke bare main koi edia nahin tha
 What is a super cyclone was also not known because we never had a confrontation with such a cyclone
 subah subah cyclone kii raftaar badhati chali gai or phir bhayankar rup dhaaran kar liya
 At that time i had a pucca house in the village, but i remember the wind speed was so high that many people of my family kept the main door of the house
 aisa lag rahaa tha jaise hawa darvaaze ko ukhadkar le jaaegi
 The wind speed was more than 300 kilometers per hour
 kitne ghanton tak hawa kaa tandav chalata rahaa mujhe yaad nahin lekin teen din tak lagaataar barish hui thi
 Gradually when the wind speed decreased, people started coming out of the house, by then everything was over
 meraa gaanv nahin tha, kahin bhi ek ped nahin thi
 The geography of the village had changed completely
 gaanv main jin logon ke kachche makaan the sab tut gaye the
 Everything seemed different from the roof top
 chaaro taraf pani hi pani tha
 People could not recognize their village
 aisa lag rahaa tha jaise ham kahin duusari jagah aa gaye hai
 My village is in Jagatsinghpur district, the district which suffered the most damage at that time
 landfoll paradeep ke aasapaas ershama or baalikud ke bich hua tha
 My house is about 40 kilometers from Paradip
 is cyclone ke tandav ne kai hazaar logon kii jaan lee thi
 Most people died from Jagatsinghpur district
 ershama or baalikuda se kai hazaar logon kii maut hui
 My village and the surrounding villages were happy, no one was killed by this cyclone
 paradeep port ke aasapaas jitne bhi ilaake the un sabakaa zyada nuksaan hua tha
 The sea water had hit the ground for about 20 kilometers to a height of about 7 to 9 meters
 logon ko iske bare main pataa nahin tha
 Water had entered inside people's house
 bahut kam logon kii do maale kii imaarat thi
 People felt that if they could not take some goods, then run away with money, but these people were weak in front of air and water
 jab logon kii ded body mili to unke hathon main paise the
 The situation was so bad that dead bodies were lying everywhere
 sarkari aankade ke hisaab se das hazaar log mare the lekin 5 xxrep 4 0 se bhi zyada logon kii maut hui thi
 The story after Cyclone was even more frightening
 raste sab tut gaye the
 Uprooted trees were lying everywhere
 us samay logon ke paas zyada mobile phone nahin hua karte the
 Nobody was calling like this as well
 phone line, bijli puri tarah thap ho gai thi
 There was no conversation with anyone
 odisha ke baahar rahane vaale log apane pariwaron ko lekar chintit the lekin unhen kuch pataa chal nahin paa rahaa tha ki unki parivaar he yaa nahin
 Those who were outside and had come to meet their families had reached their village after walking for several kilometers
 unamem kuch log apane parivaar se mil paae the to kuch logon ke liye sab kuch khatm ho gaya tha
 It took several days for the road to reach relief
 rasta saaf karne main samay laga
 i remember the relief material was being dropped from the helicopter
 jab bhi helicopter hawa main udate hue dikhaai detaa tab log ghar se baahar aa jate or helicopter kii peechha karte the
 Many times the helicopter used to drop luggage, and many times it went without dropping
 ek baar helicopter se giraaya hua ek saamaan mere paas bhi aakar gira tha
 i had tears in my eyes when i picked it up
 apane gaanv ke logon kaa haal dekhakar main khud tut gaya tha
 The relief packet i received contained churda and jaggery
 mere gaanv or aasapaas ke log kaaphi samajhadaar the
 Whoever got the goods of Relief used to gather all in one place, then it was distributed to everyone
 yah nahin tha ki koi ek riliff kaa saamaan lekar bhaag jaae
 a few hours of super cyclone had changed everything
 lite or phone conection ke liye kai din lag gaye
 It has been 21 days since the announcement of demonetisation by PM Modi on 8 November
 logon ke bich tab se machi afratfari or cash crunch ke bich ab aglaa sawaal yah he ki 30 november se lekar 7 disambar ke bich logon ko vetan milanaa he or iske liye sarkaar dwaara kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 Obviously, on December 1, the demand for cash will be more and the congestion in banks and atms will increase more
 yahaan yah bhi gauratlab he ki aisa nahin he ki puure desh main sabhi kaa vetan acounts main jamaa hota ho
 There are also many classes where cash pay is given
 aise main niyokta nakad vetan kaise denge? yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Also, how will the people who have salary credits in their accounts withdraw money that the withdrawal limit is fixed and the banks are not taking the name of termination
 bainkon main nakadi kaa flo bhale hi abhi badha ho lekin sankat abhi kaayam he
 In such a situation, measures were taken to support the salary of the people on a large scale, but how effective they will be, it will be clear only on November 30 and December 1

 According to Valentine's Week, Kiss Day is celebrated on February 12
 un logon ke liye to yah din kisi vardaan se kam nahin, jo kareeb aane ko tarasate hi rah jate hai, lekin saathi unhen iskaa mauka hi nahin detii
 So get ready to make this day memorable and enjoy it to the fullest
 agar aap is din ko khaasaa jaayakedaar bananaa chaahate hai, to aisa karne main koi harj nahin
 The last day is of your name
 or agar aap is baat ko lekar pareshaan hai ki kis tarah unke dil main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar karnaa he, kya bolnaa he or kya sunanaa he, to janaab is din shabdon ko jaraa sirahaane se jhatka dijie
 Why should these days talk with words, not words
 
 
 aaj ke din apane honton ko khol kar na bolen, jo bhi bolen hothon ko silkar mahaj sparsh se
 If you want to start, do it from the surface, not your soul
 haa is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki jab bhi aap samvaad kaa ye silsilaa chheden to samay sahi ho
 It should not happen that due to the right work being done at the wrong time, you get the definition of wrong
 puure din unhen ahsaas karaate rahen ki ve kitni special hai
 If you want to create an atmosphere, then move closer to them, slowly take them in your arms
 aapaki ye harakat unamem uttejnaa bhar degi
 Just then what if she wants to stop you even then she will not be able to stop
 iske baad to band honton ko hi kholane hai shame ke parde
 If you do not want to spend a single moment of your Kiss day, then do not let them get away from you even for a moment
 kareeb hone ke ahsaas ko jitna ho sake badhaate rahen
 Touch the soft parts of their body
 lekin aisa karte hue bistar ko dhyaan main na rakhen
 Just love and keep this day in mind
 jab unhen chhuen to najaron se nazren milaanaa na bhoolen
 During this, make them feel in gestures that they look great
 bas ab aapako kuch zyada karne kii jarurat nahin komalta se apane hothon ko rakh den unke hothon par
 Then see how your Kiss Day becomes memorable

 echdi kumaraswami ke netritv vaali congress-jedies sarkaar alpamat ke chalate floor test main gir gai
 There were 99 votes in favor of congress-jds and 105 in favor of BJP
 is tarah 14 maheene tak chali gathbandhan sarkaar ko satta se baahar hona padaa
 What happened to HD Kumaraswamy was similar to what happened to Congress and BJP governments
 2004 main giraayi congress sarkaar2004 ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main kul 224 siton main se bijepi ko 79, congress ko 65, jedies ko 58 or anya ko 23 siten mili thi
 That is, no party got a majority in 2004
 aise main congress or jedies ke bich samjhauta hua or congress ke dharamsingh 28 may 2004 ko karnataka ke mukhyamantri bane
 This government could not run for a long time and after two and a half years Kumaraswamy withdrew support with his mlas and toppled Dharam Singh's government
 us vakt bhi aisi hi siyaasi khinchataan dekhne ko mili thi jaisaa pichley do hafton main bengalooru main gata
 Kumaraswamy formed an alliance with the BJP after Dagadharam Singh's government fell with the BJP
 isi ke chalate rajyapal ne jedies ko sarkaar banane kaa aamantran diya
 Kumaraswamy became the chief minister in 2006 with the support of the BJP
 is dauraan bijepi-jedies ke bich sarkaar banane se pehle sahmati bani thi ki donon partiyon ke netaa baari-baari se or baraabar-baraabar samay ke liye mukhyamantri banenge
 Kumaraswamy completed his term and when the time came to hand over power to the BJP, he refused to do so
 yahi nahin kumaraswami ne 10 november ko mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya, jiske baad rajyapal ko karnataka main raashtrapati shashan lagaana padaa
 In 2007, after the resignation of the BJP government Kumaraswamy fell under President's rule for two days and then the BJP claimed to form the government
 12 nambevar 2007 ko bies yediurppa ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkaar bani, jise kumaraswami ne baahar se samarthan diya
 However, Kumaraswamy withdrew support to the BJP government after seven days, which led to Yeddyurappa losing the chief minister's post
 kumaraswami ne jo boyaa vahi katakarnataka kii raajnneeti ne aisi karavat lee ki kumaraswami ne jo boyaa vahi kaata
 No party got a majority in the Karnataka assembly elections in 2018
 rajyapal ne bijepi ko sabase badi party hone ke naate sarkaar banane ke liye nimantran diya or yediurppa ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee, lekin vidhansabha main bahumat sabit nahin kar sake
 After this, the jds-congress formed the government under the leadership of Kumaraswamy
 lekin 14 maheene ke kaarykaal ke baad congress ke 13 or jedies ke 3 vidhayakon ne baghawat kar di or vidhayak pad se istipha de diya, jiske baad kumaraswami vidhansabha main bahumat sabit nahin kar sake
 That is, they too faced the same political situation as Dharam Singh and Yeddyurappa had to do
 is tarah congress or bijepi donon kaa hisaab baraabar ho gaya
 In the wake of drought-hit Bundelkhand, farmer suicides and starvation incidents, Rahul Gandhi may visit here soon to increase political mercury
 upi congress ne sanket die hai ki 10 janvari ke aasapaas yah daura ho saktaa he yaa isaki tasviir saaf ho sakati he
 Rahul's visit is also important because there is a famine-like situation in the Bundelkhand land that is dry and the Congress party wants to be farmer friendly on this whole issue in view of the 2017 UP Assembly elections
 upi congress upaadhyaksh dalajit singh ne shanivaar shaam banda main yah jaankaree di
 The Congress wants to look sensitive towards farmers
 It is believed that Rahul Gandhi's visit to Bundelkhand will be very different from his previous visits
 centre or pradesh main duusari partiyon kii sarkaar hone kii vajah se rahul gandhi behad aakraamak najar aa sakate hai
 In view of the preparations for UP assembly elections in 2017, the Congress party wants to look very sensitive on the issue of farmers, in view of this, Rita Bahuguna Joshi will visit Banda on January 3 and visit many villages suffering from drought
 upi congress upaadhyaksh dalajit singh ne banda main bataaya ki rahul gandhi kaa kaarykram abhi nirdhaarit nahin hua he lekin bundelkhand ke kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar unke netaa bahut samvedansheel hai or isi maheene kii 10 taarikh ke aasapaas vah yahan kaa daura kar sakate hai
 Daradaljit Singh will soon decide, 'the farmer in Bundelkhand region has been committing suicide due to debt and unemployment
 yah sookhaa aria he sinchai ke saadhan nahin hai
 The schemes have become corrupt
 congress sadan main yah mudda uthaati rahi he
 Our leader Rahul Gandhi has already done many visits to Bundelkhand in this regard, as i know he is going to visit here very soon
 nishchit taur par 10 janvari ke aasapaas daura hone kii ummid he
 Two-three days program may be back and forth, soon the program will be clear
 dalajit singh ne kaha, 'congresane yahaan aakar pehle kisaanon kaa karj maaf karaayaa tha jabaki grahamantri yahaan aakar karj maaf karne se saaf manaa kar gaye
 Rahul ji had also got the Bundelkhand package, he does not do all this politically but helps people wholeheartedly

 magar ab ek ke baad ek muthbhedon kii jhadi lag gai
 Fakt 11 months and twelve hundred encounters
 yani har maheene sau se bhi zyaada encounter
 Isn't it awesome? On one hand, the UP government guns did not work, and now suddenly the same guns are being fired
 ugale bhi kyon naa? jab trigar par oongli yogi ke farmaan kii ho or encounter sarkari aadesh to goliyaan chalengi hi
 The culmination of the culprit! The question is why suddenly there was an encounter in UP? Has the law system broken down in UP so much that there is no way other than an encounter? Have the criminal in UP become so uninspired that they suddenly become a threat to the entire society? Did the UP Police become so helpless in these 11 months that it is unable to control crime? Or the government has chosen the easiest way to end the crime, then end the criminal itself
 kya encounter hi he ekmaatr upaay?par kya ye rasta sahi he? kya upi kii kanoon vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye encounter hi ekmaatr rasta or aakhri hathiyaar he? agar haa, to phir jab tak ye encounter jari he, tab tak ke liye kyon naa upi kii tamaam adaalaton par taala laga dena chahie? vaise bhi adaalaton kii jagah insaaf to ab sadak par hi ho rahaa he, wo bhi goliyon se
 According to a report of 455 fake encounter National Human Rights Commission in UP, from January 1, 2005 to October 31, 2017, in the last 12 years, 1241 fake encounter cases were reported across the country

 The round of skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel has started once again

 International crude oil prices have reached the top of 3 years
 iskaa sidhaa asar desh main petrol or dijal kii keemton par padaa he
 In view of the rising prices, the oil ministry has sought to reduce excise duty in the budget
 uskaa tark he ki isse aam aadmi ko petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat milegi
 Although the government will announce the reduction of excise duty in the budget, it seems a little difficult
 badhati keemton or logon ke gusse ko dekhte hue centre sarkaar pehle hi exise duty main katautee kar chuki he
 In October, it reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2
 lekin ab uske paas duty ghataane ke liye mauka naa ke baraabar he
 The danger of increasing the fiscal deficit will now mean that such a step will mean that the government will pose a risk of increasing its fiscal deficit
 exise duty ghataane se rajkoshiya ghate ko 3
 It will be difficult for the government to achieve the target of 2 per cent

 Due to this, the expenses of companies are also increasing continuously

 In such a situation, the common man cannot do anything except wait for the fall in crude oil prices

 He has now undergone a master stroke to improve his political equation before the assembly elections

 These 40 lakh people are living in those 1797 unauthorized colonies who always used to worry about destroying their homes

 modi sarkaar ne is mudde ko apane 100 din ke agenda main pramukhataa se rakhaa he
 Earlier in 1961, for the first time such a policy was made and 101 colonies were regularized
 uske baad bhi kam se kam teen baar coloniyon ko niyamit karne kii kavayad kii gai
 Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendra Kumar Jain said that we are happy that the dream that the people of these colonies had seen is nearing completion
 dilli sarkaar in coloniyon ke liye 3000 karod rupye kharch kar chuki he
 Apart from this, it will spend 3000 crores more now
 satyendra jain ne kaha ki jald hi in colony main rahane vaale logon ko unki jameen kaa malikana haq milegaa
 Whether it lives on private land or on government land
 1994 se 2014 tak court kahati rahi- pehle suvidhaayen do, phir karo niyamitabta den ki dilli sarkaar ne 2 november, 2015 ko anadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke prastaav ko centre sarkaar ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheja tha
 However, between 1994 and 2014, the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court gave clear rulings in several cases related to these colonies that they could not be regularized until basic facilities were provided
 dilli sarkaar ne shuru kiya suvidhaayen denine mahatvapurn faislon or nirdeshon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dilli sarkaar ne in coloniyon main moolbhoot suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane kaa kaam shuru kiya he
 The basic facilities include construction of sewer, drinking water pipelines, roads, drains and streets
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ne bhi anadhikrut coloniyon main chal rahe vikaas kaaryon kaa khud jaakar kai baar nirikshan kiya

 Former Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav has again given a statement that could prove to be a setback for his son and SP president Akhilesh Yadav
 mulaayam ne upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan par hamalaa bolaa he or is baat par aapatti jaahir kii he ki akhilesh yadav is gathbandhan main aadhi siton par raji ho gaye
 Mulayam has also wished Prime Minister Narendra Modi victory and return to power in the Lok Sabha a few days ago
 mulaayam ne kaha ki aakhir kaise akhilesh yadav bahujan samaaj party ke saath aise gathbandhan ke liye raji ho gaye jisamen samaajawaadee party ke hisse main aadhi siten ai hai
 Mulayam even said that only the people of the party are busy in finishing the party
 mahilaon ko party main tarjeeh nahin mil rahi
 We formed such a big party, but the party is being weakened now
 mulaayam ne kaha ki soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se sirf 25-26 siten hi jeet sakate hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav said, 'I have told Akhilesh to declare the names of the candidates for the Lok Sabha elections so that they can prepare
 bijepi taiyaariyon ke maamle main hamase aage nikal gai he
 We finalized the names of the candidates 14 months ago and got a big win
 lekin akhilesh abhi tak tikat hi nahin tay kar paae
 He said that give tickets to the winning leaders
 shivpal ko bhi log naam de rahe hai
 Even if i give tickets, it is in my hands to remove Akhilesh
 gauratlab he ki kuch maheene baad hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke liye uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ne gathbandhan kiya he
 Under this alliance, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati have agreed to contest 38-38 seats out of a total of 80 seats
 upi kii raajnneeti ke in do dhur virodhiyon kaa ek saath aana pradesh kii raajnneeti ke purodha mulaayam ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 This is the first time Mulayam Singh Yadav has broken his silence on the SP-BSP alliance
 mulaayam ko aapatti is baat par he ki unke bete akhilesh yadav ne chunaav se pehle hi aadhi se zyada siton par apni daavedaari aakhir kaise chhod di
 The SP currently has seven mps from UP while the Bahujan Samaj Party does not have a single MP
 mulaayam ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan par sawaal uthaakar ek tarah se apane chote bhai or akhilesh ke virdohi shivpal yadav ke sur main sur milaayaa he jinhone alag party banaakar sapa ke khilaaf bigul foonka hua he
 Let me tell you that even in the 2017 assembly elections, when Akhilesh Yadav had aligned with the Congress, Mulayam Singh had raised a question
 itnaa hi nahin wo shivpal yadav or parasnath yadav kii seat ko chhodkar kisi bhi anya seat par prachaar karne nahin gaye the
 This is not the first time Mulayam has made Akhilesh Yadav uncomfortable with his statement
 isse pehle 16veen loksabhaa ke aakhri din mulaayam ne sadan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko aashirwad dete hue kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sabake saath miljulkar kaam kiya he, sabko saath lekar chalane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Our congratulations to Prime Minister Modi and we wish him to come again and become the Prime Minister
 mulaayam ke is bayaan ko bijepi le udi or lagaataar akhilesh par hamalaa karne ke liye iskaa istemaal bhi kar rahi he
 In such a situation, Mulayam's new statement may increase the difficulties of Akhilesh Yadav

 uttar pradesh ke bijli vibhaag main ek bade parivartan kii patakatha taiyaar he
 The electricity department is now starting an unprecedented plan to make farmers and women self-reliant
 bhavishya kii yojanaon or bijli vibhaag se jude muddon par urja vibhaag ke cabinet mantri shrikant sharma ne 18 disambar kii shaam lakhanu main apane sarkari awaas par'india today'se vistaar se charchaa kii
 Where do you find the power department of UP standing during two and a half years? We have made a big change in the state's electricity system
 jab hamaari sarkaar ai thi tab keval 16,500 megawatt hi peak demand thi
 It has now increased to 21,500 MW, we are also able to complete it
 ek karod, 14 lakh logon ko conection diya he
 The 'power for All' agreement has been signed with the central government
 bijli kii kami hoti to vah centre sarkaar se mil jaati he
 We have tied up with states where there is less demand for electricity in summer, from which we take electricity for UP in summer
 ham pradesh ke logon ko behatar urja uplabdh karaaen sarkaar iske sabhi vikalpon par kaam kar rahi he
 You are also a minister of the Department of Solar Energy, what is the future of solar energy in UP? India is representing the group of solar countries
 iskaa antarrashtriya karyaalay gurugram main sthapit kiya gaya he
 One of the points that have been set for sustainable development in the United Nations is 'cheap and clean electricity'
 pradhanmantri ji kaa focus he ki ham kisaanon kii aay bhi doguni karen or unhen sasti, svachh bijli bhi uplabdh karaaen
 Till now the farmer used to grow potatoes, vegetables or paddy, wheat or gram on his farm, now the farmer will also produce energy
 iske liye pradhanmantri ne ‘kusum yojana’ laanch kii he
 There is a provision in this that the farmer who is barren land can put his solar power plant there
 agar kisaan swayan sakasham nahin he to vah apni jameen ko lij par de saktaa he
 a land that is low is not fertile
 isse kisaan bijli utpaadak banegaa or is bijli ko vah power corporation ko bech bhi paaegaa
 The farmer is also comfortable that tubewells with seven and a half horsepower but up to one horse power can also be installed on solar
 isamen centre or rajya donon sarkarein anudaan de rahi hai
 This will also free the farmers from the disruption in the field with electric wires
 iske alaava kisaan pehle se hi khet main lage tubewel ko solar urja se chalaa saktaa he
 It can use as much power as it needs, it can also sell power through transmission to DISCOM
 isse na keval kisaan ko svachh urja milegi balki uski aay badhaane main bhi madad milegi
 In UP, we have targeted to install 20 thousand tubewells by 2022
 varsh 2022 tak hamane 10,700 megawatt saura urja kaa utpaadan karne kaa bhi lakshya rakhaa he
 Accordingly, the government is moving forward
 sabhi sarkari vibhaagon kii imaaraten, bhawan ko bhi saura urja se poshit karne kii yojana he
 It is starting by installing solar roof top in Shakti Bhawan, the office of the electricity department in Lucknow
 -bijli upabhoktaaon ko chote kaaryon ke liye kaaphi daudia padataa he?iske liye ham bijli vibhaag ko lagaataar smart kar rahe hai
 Smart meter, smart prepaid meter, online electricity connection through instant scheme, can collect online electricity bill, increase online load
 shaharon main smart meter or gaanv main preeped meter laga rahe hai
 Our target is to install 4 million meters
 abhi tak ham puure pradesh main saat lakh smart meter laga chuke hai
 - Losses on power department are also considerable
 isse kaise suvidhaayen bad paaengi?aaj bijli vibhaag par 13 hajaar karod rupye bakaayaa he
 This decreases discom's rating and causes consumer losses
 maine apane ghar se preeped meter lagavane kii shuruyaat kii he
 The advantage of installing prepaid meters is that the money that the electricity department used to get after six months is already being received six months ago
 bijli vibhaag jin companiyon se bijli kharidta he unhen advance main paisa dena padataa he
 By installing prepaid meters, we will be able to reduce the deficit of the electricity department
 iskaa phayda upabhoktaaon ko hoga
 In the coming time, all government buildings will be equipped with smart low prepaid meters
 abhi 25 kilowat se upar ke smart kam pripet meter uplabdh nahin he jaise hi milenge sabhi sarkari bhawan inase aachhadit ho jaaenge
 -power theft and lineloss is still a challenge for the department? We are running a campaign to reduce all types of lineloss
 65 jilon main sarkari bijli thane sthapit kiye ja chuke hai
 The aim is to bring lineloss in single digit
 iske liye vishesh abhiyaan chal rahe hai
 Smart meters are installed in AB conductors where there is maximum line-up
 billing or ‘collection iffishiency’ ko behatar karnaa chaahate hai
 Different types of losses will be reduced when the electricity department becomes smart
 iskaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko milegaa
 -effections have also come to light in the recovery of electricity bills as well
 In the coming time, collection of electricity bills will be in the hands of women
 gaanv main aane vaale dinon main 24 ghante bijli milegi
 Feeders of every village are separated
 isamen bijli bill kii vasuuli bhi shat pratishat ho iske liye mahila swayan sahaayta samoohon kii madad lee jaaegi
 For this, the scheme will be implemented initially in Mathura, Banaras, Gorakhpur and Agra
 mahilaon ko prati bill 20 rupye kii dar se bhugtan hoga
 This scheme will create employment opportunities for women
 -uttar pradesh ke power house kaaphi buudhe ho gaye hai?kai power plant bahut puraane hai
 We have plans by the year 2030
 varsh 2030 tak sarkaar ke paas paryaapt bijli he
 Plans are underway to establish several new plants
 kai plant ko apgrade bhi kar rahe hai
 The power of Uttar Pradesh Vidyut Nigam's power plant was previously very expensive by Rs 1
5 per unit, we have reduced it to 99 paise per unit
 hamane power plant ke rakrakhaav par vishesh dhyaan diya he
 -bigal Consumers are getting a lot of convenience in the state of Delhi, can not you get such benefit in UP? Comparison of two and a half government in UP with the ongoing reforms in the electricity sector in Delhi for the last 25 years
 Can
 dilli main bijli nijee haathon main he jisase ki unka linelos bahut kam he
 There are many feeders in UP who live in more than 55 percent lineloss
 dhai saal pehle jahaan upi main 32 pratishat se zyada linelos tha use ham 24 pratishat par lekar aae hai
 We are going to bring lineloss in issue one soon
 upi ke bijli vibhaag ko aarthik drushti se swaavlambee banane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The speed with which reforms are going on in up's power department will leave states like Delhi far behind
 -pief ghotaale se bijli vibhaag badnaam hua he
 The government has nothing to do with the trust associated with the provident fund
 purv kii sarkaron ne gaiyr kanoonee dhang se niyamon main badlaav kiya
 The money which was to be invested in public sector banks was invested in private banks
 hamaari sarkaar ke sangyaan main jaise hi yah aniyamitataayen ai sakchat karrwai kii gai
 The pie of the power workers will be refunded
 -bijli vibhaag main bhrashtachar kii shikaayat rahi hai?ham bhrashtachar par prahaar kar rahe hai
 The result of this is that all the contract workers in the electricity department are getting their salaries on time
 inke liye ek portal sthapit kiya gaya he
 Today, about 50 thousand contract workers are getting their rights through the portal
 adhikariyon-thekedaaron ke gathjod ko hamane todaa he
 Through Vigilance, they are also investigating disturbances in thirteen hundred and ten tenders
 sava do sau karmchaariyon par chargeshit kii gai he
 Corruption in the Energy Department will not survive
 *** Many times during summer, you too must have thought that i wish there was an ac-like device that could be kept with you at all times
 ab sapane jaisi lagane vaali is cheez ko hakeekat main badalane kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 According to a video posted by the South China Morning Post, Sony has developed a 'wearable' air-conditioner and launched a crowdfunding project for this device
 ye upar bataaya gaya viereble AC ek chote panel ke jariye warm or kool air ko relies karata he
 This pocket size AC is named Reon Pocket
 daawa he ki ye sies main mobile phone se bhi chota he
 However, this device can only be used with a 'special undershirt'
 is andershart ko bhi divaais ke saath hi cell kiya jayega
 The special thing is that the temperature of this AC can also be controlled through a smartphone
 isse bhi acchhee baat ye he ki is AC main aisi technology di gai he ki ye khud hi karact temprechar set kar letaa he
 The released video states that the technology that has been adopted for this AC is based on the Peltier element
 is technology kaa upyog car or wine coolers main kiya jaataa he
 This battery operated device can be run for 90 minutes after tow hour charging
 praapt jaankaree ke mutabik, is croudfnding project ko mahaj do dinon main $200,000 (lagbhag 1
 38 crores)
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki is viereble AC kii keemat bhi bahut zyada nahin rakhi gai he
 It will be available to customers for only $ 130 (about Rs 9,200)
 haalanki ek dikkat ye he ki isaki bikri keval japan main hi kii jaaegi, jaisaa ki video main kaha gaya
 This project has gone viral in China's social media
 garmiyon kii chhuttiyon main ab sarkari skulon main padhane vaale bacchon bhi padhai se itar apane hunar jaise dance, khel-kud, sangeet, kala aadi ko samar campon main taraashne kaa mauka milegaa

 isi tanatani ko lekar purvi dilli nagar ke meyar or parshadon ke alaava dilli bijepi ke mahasachiv kulajit chahal ne sachivalay ke paas dharna pradarshan kiya
