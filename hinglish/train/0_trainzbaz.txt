 Those days were of high growth
 2006 janvari kii ek thandi shaam us samay garma uthi jab udyog vibhaag ne (single brands) retail videsh nivesh kaa elaan kiya
 Earlier, Kufr was referring to foreign investment in retail
 is bayaan ke agle hi saal, 2007 main hi walmart bharti (airtel) ke saath bharat aa gai
 Seeing Walmart, global retailers like Carfu and Tesco also arrived
 2010 main multi brands retail kholane kii pahal hui or vibhinn sharton ke saath 2012 main 51 fisadi videshi nivesh khulaa to lekin sangh parivaar or bhaajapa ne is kadar andolan khadaa kiya ki retail main videshi nivesh jahaan kaa tahaan tham gaya
 Walmart also opened wholesale mega stores in about a dozen cities, but bored of politics over multi-brand retail for foreigners, Walmart ended its venture with Bharti in 2013
 is hadabong ke bich desi companiyon ko sangathit retail main phayda dikhne laga tha
 Desi retailers such as Subhiksha, Spencer (RPG), Reliance, More (birla), Easy Day (bharti), Trent (tata), Big Bazaar (future) emerged and organized retail grew at a pace of 21 per cent between 2010 and 2015
 Hope began to take root
 lekin commercial property, nai takanic or buniyadi dhaanche ke liye inke paas puunji kii kami thi isliye 2015 aate aate tamaam store band ho gaye
 At the same time, there was an influx of e-commerce
 nae dhanadhyon (venture capital) kii puunji par discount cell ke is dhandhe ne sangathit retail ko tod diya
 The e-commerce revolution was short-lived
 paraspar virdohi nitiyon or notebandi va jiesti ke baad 2017 main desi i-commers bhi dam tod gaya
 Now this market will be ruled by two foreign companies — Amazon and Walmart (acquisition of Flipkart)
 retail ke udaarikaran ke 12 saal baad aaj
 
 
 • Modernization of retail business could simultaneously accelerate farming, food processing, manufacturing, manufacturing, financial services and this area with an average of one employment per 200 sq ft could become the engine of all types of employment but foreign investment in it was stopped
 Given
 • mukt bazaar main puunji apana rasta talash hi leti he
 Walmart entered e-commerce through the backdoor through which capital could provide employment by creating retail infrastructure
 ab vah upabhoktaaon ko saamaan bechegi, jiske liye use videshi nivesh niyamon ke tahat roka gaya tha
 The maximum number of new jobs created by e-commerce will only be from courier bringers
 • bharat ke logon kii khapat main 61 fisad hissaa khaadya utpaadon kaa he
 To increase employment and consumer facilities, their production and distribution had to be modernized but it has remained backward
 yah keval bhaajapa parivaar kii ruudhivaadee jid thi jiske chalate vishaal khudara bazaar ko aadhuniktaa or nae rojgaron kii roshni nahin mil saki
 But foreign capital has arrived
 ab is bazaar ke ek hisse (i-commers) par videshi companiyaan kabiz ho gayi hai jabaki duusare bade hisse main puraane dharre kaa kaarobaar chal rahaa he
 Consumers and unemployed standing between these two are forgetting the government

 The Board of Secondary Education (UPMSP) of Uttar Pradesh has increased the examination fee for the high school (10th) and intermediate board examinations (12th) by six times in 2020
 pehle hai skool kaa pariksha shulk keval 80 rupee tha, lekin ab badhaakar 500 rupee kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, the intermediate examination fee was only Rs 90 but now it has been increased to Rs 600
 upi hai skool kii parikshaon main upasthit hone vaale nijee chaatro ko ab 200 rupee ke bajaay 700 rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 At the same time, private students appearing in intermediate examination will have to pay Rs 800 instead of Rs 220
 jo chaatr- chatraayen board pariksha main shaamil honge unhen 15 agast se pehle apane- apane vidyalayon ke pradhanadhyaapak ke paas shulk kii raashi jamaa karnaa jaruri hogi
 Let us tell you, the UP board had also increased the fee amount for revaluation examinations five times earlier in April
 jaane- kyon badha shulkaupi board parikshaon ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki yah pariksha shulk kii vruddhi isliye kii gai he taaki upi board sibiesai or siaiessii ko samakaksh laayaa ja sake
 Uttar Pradesh Board Secretary Nina Srivastava says that most of our students are from rural areas, so we are still not charging those students as much as CBSE and CISCE
 sibiesai main, hai skool or intermediat ke chaatro kii paanch vishyon kii pariksha ke liye 750 rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa hota he
 On the other hand, if students take an additional subject, then a separate fee of Rs 100 is charged from them
 siaiessii ke chaatro kaa pariksha shulk 1500 rupee he
 Due to this, Umesh Dwivedi, State President of Secondary Financeless Teachers Mahasabha (secondary self-finance Teachers Association) said- "when the government talks about giving free food and school dress to everyone, then this increase in examination fee for students is inappropriate
" Huh"

 The question of the hanging of Afzal Guru, an accused in the attack on Parliament, has taken a political turn
 jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main jahaan is par jamkar hangaamaa hua, vahi mukhyamantri umr abdulla kaa maananaa he ki afjal kii faansee se ghati ke halaat or bigadenge
 The question of the execution of the person who planned the attack on Parliament and carried it to the end, caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly
 bijepi or panthars party ke netaa afjal kii faansee ke prastaav par charchaa ke virodh main khadey hai
 The proposal to waive the sentence of Rajiv Gandhi's killers was passed in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly
 uske baad hi sansad par aatanki hamale ke gunahagaar afjal guru kii faansee par bhi raajnneeti tej ho gayi
 The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir himself has believed that hanging will worsen the situation and he has repeated the same thing once again
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru ko faansee par chadaaye jane se rajya main aatankwaadi hamale dobaaraa shuru ho sakate hai jise lekar vah chintit hai
 Omar said, 'I have to worry about Afzal Guru being hanged
 afjal ko faansee dene se rajya or centre sarkaar donon ke liye mushkilen khadi hongi
 He mentioned that a force of militants had been ready in Kashmir after the execution of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) leader Muhammad Maqbool Bhatt in 1984
 abdulla ne kaha, 'main vah bhula nahin saktaa ki makabool bhatta ko faansee dene se aatankwaadiyon kii ek puri peedi paidaa ho gai
 i have to be concerned that the hanging of Afzal Guru will lead to a spurt in terrorist incidents in the Valley which are quite low at the moment
 'unhone kaha, 'main mrityudand die jane ke paksh main nahin hum
 It will not succeed in intimidating murderers or terrorists
 isi saal disambar main sansad par aatanki hamale ke das saal puure hone hai
 But instead of punishing the culprit of the attack, the trick of politics has started to save him

 In his last rally for the Delhi Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have clarified the controversial words written in the vision document of his party in relation to the people of north-east, but it seems that bjp's problems are not over
 Huh
 janata dal united (jediu) ke netaa or bihar ke purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne vijan document main shiksha ke maamle main dilli ke collejon main 85 pratishat siten keval dilli ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye arakshit karne par sawaal khadaa kiya he
 Nitish Kumar issued a statement asking what would happen to the future of thousands of students coming from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, north-east states if 85 percent of the seats would be reserved only for the students of Delhi
 nitish ne apane bayaan main kaha, "is tarah kaa vichaar dilli kii mishrit samskruti (composite culture) par kutil vyangy he
 
 
 If such rules and regulations were implemented, it reflects bjp's negative thinking for the students and the country
 
 
 " nitish ne bijepi netaaon se poocha ki kya baahar ke rajyon ke chaatro ko desh kii rajdhani dilli main padhane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 This statement by Nitish Kumar will increase difficulties for BJP leaders not only in Bihar but also in Delhi, because during the election campaign, they have engaged many leaders, mps of these states to mobilize the residents of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh settled in Delhi
 Has happened
 is bich, bijepi pravaktaa shahanwaaz hossain ne kaha he ki unki party dilli main sarkaar banane par collejon main siten badhayegi, lekin unke paas is baat kaa koi jawaab nahin tha ki sirf 15 fisadi siton ke jariye dilli se baahar ke chaatro ke saath nyaay kaise ho paaegaa

 Forgetting the spirit of the game, the junior player abused Virat Kohli after dismissing him, Nitish Rana celebrated Virat Kohli when he was out during the match and he used some aggressive language and also used some vulgar language

 How much persecution has been done? ve sabak lengi to loktantr ke liye bhi bahut behatar baat hogi
 Will this change not create a new challenge for the SP? There is still 4 years and 8 months left for the next assembly election
 itane vakt main koun-sa kanta kahaan laga or koun-si raah kis taraf mud gai, kisi ko yaad nahin rahegaa

 Different sectors have many expectations from this budget, including the field of education
 ajukeshan sector main bacchon, shikshan sansthaanon, shikshakon or sarkari parikshaon kii taiyaari kar rahe ummidavaaron ko alag alag ummiden hai
 Before knowing what the education sector expects this year, let us know what announcements the government had made in the last year's budget
 
 
 
 The 2017 budget allocated Rs 79686 crore to the education sector in the 2017 budget, which was just 8-9 per cent higher than the 2016 budget, according to the Finance Ministry website
 bataa den ki 2016 main shiksha ke kshetra main 73599 karod rupee haath lage the
 It was being told that budget cuts were made in the field of education due to increased government expenditure on the seventh pay commission
 agar kul bajet ke aadhaar par baat karen to saal 2017 main kul bajet kaa 3
 711 share was given to education sector, while 3 in 2016
 653 hissaa shiksha ke naam kiya gaya tha
 The budget has not changed since the Mauryan period! Earlier this was the way it was done, the last time the Central Board of Secondary Education and All India Council for Technical Education were asked to focus on the level of education by freeing them from conducting examinations
 saath hi textile kshetra main naukariyaan badhaane, shikshan sansthaanon ko behatar banane, swayam ajukeshan portal kholane jaise vaade kiye gaye the
 Please tell that you can get information about the course from swayam website
 is saal kya he ummiden-videshi shiksha model apanaaenis saal chaatro ko ummiden hai ki desh main shiksha ke str main or adhik badhaava mili
 For this, the plan of developed countries can be implemented here
 saath hi shiksha ke kshetra main videshi nivesh badhaayaa janaa chahie
 With this, some technology will be able to come to India and due to the fine foreign relations in education, children will be able to go to study abroad from here
 sirf bhaashan se hi nahin, vitt mantri is tarah pesh karte hai puraa bajtejukeshan lone main chhot or saraltaucch shiksha hasil karne ke liye ajukeshan lone sabase zyada sahyog karata he
 But, due to many difficult rules, many people cannot take advantage of it
 vahiin chaatr chaahate hai ki iske niyamon main thodi chhot di jaae or byaaj kii dar main kami kii jaae
 Many times students are asked to pledge many papers for loans, so that students cannot take advantage of them
 muft shikshasbhi sarkari or nijee skulon ko primary str se muft shiksha ke niyam ko acchhee tarah se lagu kiya janaa chahie
 The government has tried in the past as well and more reforms should be done
 muft or anivaary shiksha ko is tarah se lagu kiya janaa chahie ki sabhi ke liye ek samaan pratiyogita kaa str taiyaar ho sake
 Increase in budget: Education budget was increased by 9% last time, but it was very less
 is baar 14 fisadi kii badhotaree aavashyak he taaki shiksha ke str main sudhaar ho sake
 According to experts, given the condition of primary education in the country, the education sector in the budget needs tremendous financial support
 bajet se pehle samajhie kis shabd kaa kya hota he matlabapractical par rahe jordesh main theory kii shiksha chaatro ko di jaati he, lekin prectical or prashikshan ke kshetra main bharat abhi peeche he
 Therefore, students want that the budget should focus on training and preparation of practicals
 isse gyaan ke saath chaatro kii skill main bhi badhotaree ho jaaegi
 For this, the government will have to organize several programs
 technology main ho badhavadesh kii skulon main aaj bhi puraane tareeke se padhai ho rahi he, jisamen ab badlaav kii aavashyaktaa he
 Actually children now need to be taught through interesting and technology
 isse bachche kam samay main acchhee shiksha grahan kar sakenge

 sansad se paas hone ke baad naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak kaa bengal, assam, meghalaya or kuch anya rajyon main purajor virodh hua

 ab isse yah sawaal uthta he ki bharat main in deshon se aae logon kii aabaadi he kitni?india tudeki data intelligence unit (diaiu) ne 2011 kii janaganana ke aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki bharat se baahar paidaa hue logon kii sankhya desh kii aabaadi kaa 0
 Not even 4 percent
 iskaa matlab yah ki har 1000 main se 4 log hi desh ke baahar janme hai
 Census data also shows which country people originated from outside
 janagannaamein do tareeke se baahar se ai aabaadi ko darshaya gaya he
 One, who was born outside India and the other, whose previous residence was outside India
 hamane un logon ke aankadon ko dekha jinka pichhlaa awaas pakistan yaa bangladesh main tha or paaya ki unki zyaadaatar aabaadi to 1990 se bhi pehle bharat aa chuki thi
 What the figures say: The 2011 Census data shows that there were a total of 55 lakh people in India whose previous residence was outside India, which is just 0 of the country's population
 44 pratishat hi he
 Of these, 23 lakh (42 percent) came from Bangladesh and 7 lakh (12)
 7 pratishat) pakistan se aae
 The number of immigrants from Afghanistan was 6596 only
 in aankadon se saaf he ki desh main baahar se ai aabaadi kaa 55 pratishat to or pakistani or bangladeshi apravasi hi hai
 People from both these countries 0 of the total population of India
 24 pratishat hi hai
 The census data also shows how many years immigrants from the country have been living here
 isse kuch had tak maaloom hota he ki kitne saalon main kitne log baahar se desh main aae
 Our analysis found that most of the immigrants in the country came only after the partition of 1947 and the Bangladesh liberation war in 1971
 1991 se pehle or baad apravasiyon ke aagaman kaa samay jaanane ke liye hamane janaganana 2011 ke dauraan unke bharat main rahane kii avadhi ko parkhaa
 CENSUS divides this period into five parts - immigrants who had not lived in India for even a year, who have been living in India for one to 4 years, who had been living in India for five to nine years, ten to nineteen Been living in India for years and living in India for more than 20 years
 saal 2011 ko maapdand maanate hue ham in aankadon ko saal ke hisaab se dekhte hai
 This will tell us how many immigrants came to India from these countries in 2011, 2007 to 2010, 2002 to 2006, 1992 to 2001 and 1991 and earlier
 hamaare aankalan main paaya gaya ki bangladesh kii 76 pratishat or pakistan kii 79 pratishat apravasi aabaadi to saal 1990 se pehle hi aa gai thi
 After 1991, the number of immigrants from these countries does not remain 21 percent
 2011 main hi lagbhag 22 hajaar bangladeshiyon ne desh main pravesh kiya tha
 This is not even one per cent of the total number of immigrants from Bangladesh
 saal 2011 main hi 6405 logpakistanse aae the, yah bhi unki kul aabaadi kaa ek pratishat hissaa bhi nahin he
 The statistics of housing licenses in India also tell that in which state in the country are the immigrants living
 23 bangladeshi apravasiyon main se 95 pratishat un ilaakon main rahete hai jo bangladesh ke saath seemaa saajha karte hai
 The number of immigrants from Bangladesh is 82 percent in West Bengal, 9 percent in Tripura and 3 percent in Assam
 pakistan se aae 28 pratishkpravasipunjab main rahete hai, 17 pratishat dilli main, 15 pratishat haryana main or 9 pratishat rajasthan main rahete hai
 Immigrants from Pakistan also live in Maharashtra (8 percent) and Gujarat (4 percent)
 keval 2 pratishat pakistani apravasi jammu kashmir main rahete hai
 Our assessment also found that West Bengal was the most popular place for immigrants from Bangladesh
 janaganana kii khamiyanjanganana kii sabase badi khami yahi he ki ise har das saal main kiya jaataa he
 Therefore we do not have the latest number of visitors
 haalanki, janaganana main desh main maujuud har vyakti ko gina jaataa he lekin isse yah saaf nahin ho paata ki inamen se kitne apravasi gaiyr kanoonee tareekon se desh main ghuse
 In July 2019, Home Minister of State for Home Affairs Rayanay while replying to a question in the Lok Sabha said that there is no concrete data of immigrants coming from illegal ways
 rifuji kii sankhyaunited neshans kamishnar for rifuji (UNHCR) se hamen desh main aane vaale sharnaarthiyon kii sankhya ke bare main pataa chalata he
 Even in these figures, the number of refugees coming from Pakistan was only between 1- 4
 bangladesh se aane vaale rifusiyon kaa zikr nahin tha
 This is because, largely, someone is given refugee status when he is leaving his country and fleeing because he was being persecuted for religion, ethnicity, political reasons
 bangladesh ke adhiktakpravasiaarthik kaarnon se bharat aate hai, jisase ve rifuji nahin kahe ja sakate
 According to a report by arnigie India, most Bangladeshi come to India in illegal ways, that too for small business
 yadi bangladeshi sharan le bhi rahe hai to ve zyaadaatar europe ke italy main jaakar sharan lete hai - yah bhi UNHCR ke data se spasht ho gaya

 a proposal to change the names of the Bombay and Madras High Courts was approved by the Union Cabinet on Tuesday
 kendriya mantrimandal ne sansad ke ek adhinium ke madhyam se donon hai corton ke naam unke shaharon mumbai or chennai ke maujuuda naamon par karne ke liye kanoon mantralay ke ek prastaav ko manjuur kar liya

 But at present there is no central law under which the proposal to change the names of these high courts can be taken into consideration
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kendriya mantrimandal ke faislon par samvaadadaataaon ko jaankaree dete hue bataaya tha ki kalakatta hai court kaa naam bhi badalakar kolkata hai court kiya jayega
 But in a subsequent government release, only the Madras and Bombay High Courts were mentioned
 kalakatta hai court kaa naam bhi kolkata hai court karne kii maangen raheen hai

 India, unaffected by China's blockade over attempts to include Masood Azhar, the head of the Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, in the list of global terrorists, has initiated talks with several member countries of the UN Security Council in this regard and But is considering several options
 sarkari sutron ne kaha, 'ham sabhi vikalpon par vichaar kar rahe hai or anya sah-praayojakon ke saath bhi salaah-mashvira kar rahe hai'
 India reacted sharply on December 30 to China's opposition to its proposal at the United Nations, stating that Beijing's decision reflected double standards in the fight against terrorism
 bharat ko ummid thi ki china sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) kii 1267 samiti main prastaav kaa samarthan karegaa
 a few days before this proposal, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had filed a charge sheet against Azhar in the Pathankot terror attack case
 sutron ne kaha ki bharat ne jaish pramukh ko sanyukt raashtra dwaara vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karaane ke liye nae sire se pahal shuru karne kii disha main koi samaysima tay nahin kii he
 China's 'technical hurdle' on India's move over Azhar ended on 31 December and India or any other UNSC member country will now have to make a fresh request in this regard
 sanyukt raashtra kii samiti dwaara ajahar ko aatankwaadiyon kii suchi main shaamil karne se pakistan samet kai deshon ko ajahar kii yatra par pabandi lagaani hogi or uski sampatti jabt kerani hogi
 China was the only country in the 15-member UNSC committee to oppose India's request
 tippaniyan China, while dismissing India's criticism, said that it took a just, objective and professional attitude in decision-making in the case

 India hoped that China would support the resolution in the 1267 Committee of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 is prastaav se kuch din pehle hi rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ne pathankot aatanki hamale ke maamle main ajahar ke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil kiya tha
 Sources said that India has not set any deadline to launch a fresh initiative to declare the Jaish chief as a global terrorist
 ajahar ko lekar bharat ke kadam par china kaa 'takneekee avrodh' 31 disambar ko samaapt ho gaya tha or bharat yaa yuanessi ke kisi anya sadsy desh ko ab nae sire se is sambandh main anurodh karnaa hoga
 The inclusion of Azhar in the list of terrorists by the United Nations committee will require many countries, including Pakistan, to ban Azhar's visit and confiscate his assets
 yuanessi kii 15 sadasyeey samiti main bharat ke anurodh kaa virodh karne vaala china ekmaatr desh tha

 An example of humanitarianism and solidarity has emerged from Uttar Pradesh, where villagers, while showing courage, rescued an innocent child from the clutches of abducted miscreants

 Governments do not listen to our demands, so we are going to Delhi
 nagar ne kaha ki kisaanon kii yatra aage bhi jari rahegi lekin kisi prakaar kii hinsa kaa sahaara nahin liya jayega

 nagar ne kaha, gandhi jayanti ke din agar kisaan rajghat jaakar pradarshan karnaa chahta he, upwas karnaa chahta he to isamen bura kya he
 The question is why the farmer came to the road, leaving the farm and leaving his dairy
 ye sochane kii baat he
 10 year old tractor was banned for use, increased electricity bill by two and a half times
 dijal par prati litre 30 se 35 rupye tex vasula ja rahaa he

 The middlemen are benefiting, so the farmer will not come to say his pain and pain to the government, then where will he come
 nagar ne kaha, un police adhikariyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai honi chahie or kisaanon kii sari maangen maani jaani chahie

 And also that no one thing defines who you are

 But its just that

 Given the upcoming assembly elections in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, it is unlikely that Mukherjee will withdraw the stimulus package altogether and take stern steps to increase government revenue

 The Congress has announced the implementation of the Minimum Income Scheme (NYAY) on the lines of MNREGA to regain its lost political ground and return to power by defeating the BJP
 is yojana ke tahat desh ke kareeb 5 karod garib pariwaron ko salanaa 72 hajaar rupee yani 6 hajaar rupye prati maah die jane kaa vaada he
 The Congress is stunned by the ground response to this justice scheme and is adopting it as the biggest electoral weapon
 yahi vajah he ki congress 'ab hoga nyaay' ke naare ke saath loksabhaa chunaav ke siyaasi sangram main utari he
 On March 25, Congress President Rahul Gandhi announced that if the Congress government is formed at the Center, 20 percent of the poorest families in the country will be provided an unconditional amount of Rs 72,000, ie Rs 6 thousand every month
 ye rakam sidhe khate main daalane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Rahul claimed that the minimum income scheme (justice) of the Congress would benefit 5 crore families or about 25 crore people (assuming 5 people per family)
 congress nyaay yojana ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apane sabase bade vaade ke taur par pesh kar rahi he
 However, the BJP dismisses it as an electoral propaganda
 itnaa hi nahin basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne saharanpur kii raily main congress ke 72 hajaar salanaa dene ke vaade ko narendra modi ke 15-15 lakh dene vaale vaade kii tarah jumala qaraar diya he
 But, the way the justice scheme is getting a response on the ground, the Congress has got a lot of courage
 sarven main aae aise rujhaancongress ke nyaay yojana ko lekar india today ke political stock exange (PSE) ke liye exis-maai-india ne ek survey kiya
 Less than a week after the plan was announced, 41% of the voters in the Congress-ruled states reached
 madhya pradesh main 45%, chhattisgarh 33%, rajasthan 45% or karnataka main 37% voter is yojana se avgat hai
 In four states, 26% voters are confident that if the Congress comes to power at the Center, then this party will be able to implement 'justice'
 PSE ke mutabik 42% voter is yojana ke moort rup lene par ashankit he
 At the same time, 29% voters could not express a clear opinion on this question
 survey ko aadhaar banaate hue congress kaa kahana he ki itane kam dinon main agar in rajyon kii aadhi janata tak nyaay yojana kii jaankaree pahunch chuki he to aane vaale dinon main yah party ke liye gemeanger sabit hogi
 The Congress claimed that the party is taking this plan to the masses on a war footing so that the anti-people policies of the BJP can be responded to through 'justice'
 'jan-jan tak pahunchaayenge nyaay'india today patrika ke mutabik is yojana ke vishaal paimaane ko dekhte hue ise ab tak ghoshit is kism kii yojanaon main sabase mahatvakankshi or vyapak saamaajik kalyaan kaarykram kaha ja saktaa he
 Even if it is still part of the election manifesto
 loksabhaa ke matdaan ke pehle charan se mahaj 17 din pehle ghoshit nyaay yojana chunaavon main gemeanger sabit ho sakati he
 From Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi to party leaders and activists are busy taking this justice plan from village to village
 manaregaa ke jariye 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav jeet or pichley disambar main congress ne teen rajyon rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main kisaan karjamaafee ke jariye bijepi ko maat di thi
 Encouraged by this victory, the party has sharpened its attacks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on issues of unemployment and agrarian crisis
 isi tarj par rahul ne loksabhaa chunaav main nyaay yojana kii ghoshnaa kar master stroke chalaa he
 Political pundits firmly believe that the promise of debt waiver by the farmers in the December assembly elections significantly boosted the Congress's prospects
 bijepi kii gramin sitonmen madhya pradesh main 31 fisad, rajasthan main 57 fisad or chhattisgarh main 68 fisad kami ai thi
 Like the peasant debt waiver, the Congress's justice plan can affect the rural and semi-rural seats the most
 gramin ilaakon main asarloksabhaa ke jin 513 nirvachan kshetron kaa 2011 kii janaganana ke aankadon ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya tha, unamem se kam se kam 290 gramin or 131 ardh-gramin kshetra vaali site hai
 Rural constituencies are those where urban population is less than 25 per cent, while semi-rural constituencies are those where urban population is more than 25 per cent but less than 50 per cent
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne 156 gramin or 69 ardh-gramin siten jiti thim
 Of the 282 seats it won in other words, 80 per cent came from rural and semi-rural areas
 jabaki congress kii jiti hui kul 44 siton main se 32 gramin or ardh-gramin vaali siten thi
 In the three states out of the top five in terms of the number of Lok Sabha seats, a large proportion is rural and semi-rural seats
 uttar pradesh main 80 main se 74, maharashtra main 48 main se 33, pashchim bengal main 42 main se 32, bihar main 40 main se 39 or tamilnadu main 39 main se 23 aisi siten hai
 This plan of Congress can increase political difficulties for BJP
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 'nyaay' kaa dayera keval gramin ilaakon tak simit nahin he balki shahari or tear-2 kshetron main bhi yah asar dikhaa sakati he
 The Congress is engaged in creating an atmosphere for this scheme on the ground
 use iskaa rispance bhi acha mil rahaa he, jiske chalate congress ne is yojana ke jariye 'ab hoga nyaay' naaraa diya he
 Where the message of this scheme is to be conveyed through this slogan
 vahiin, congress ye bhi bataane kii koshish kar rahi he ki pichley paanch saal bijepi ke raaj main desh kii janata ke saath anyaay hua he

 The country's largest court has given two consecutive judgments which were much needed
 pehla to yah ki dahej ke maamalon mengiraftaar sirf jaruri hone par hi ho or doosraa fatvon ke bare main
 The dowry law was enacted many years ago in view of the deaths due to dowry in the country
 kanoon banane waalon or janata kii raay thi ki dahej utpeedan ke maamle ascharyajanak rup se bad gaye hai or unka nidaan tathaa unhen rokane ke liye sakht kanoon kii jarurat he
 This law was then made
 lekin durbhagyavash us kanoon kaa itnaa durupyog hone laga ki baat supreme court tak ja pahunchi or usne faisla diya ki is tarah ke maamalon main giraftaar tabhi ho jab uski jarurat dikhaai de
 That is, it seems that the accused is pressurizing the witnesses in that case or he is committing some other crime or is preparing to escape
 darasal dahej pratadna ke maamalon main sakht kanoon hone ke kaaran police un sabhi ko giraftaar kar leti he jinke naam exiaar menhote hai
 By the way, many times, many old people, people living in other cities and even nris got wrapped up and reached jail
 is kanoon main turant jamaanat kaa praavdhaan na hone ke kaaran log ise hathiyaar bana lete hai or kai baar badla chukaane ke iraade se kai aise logon ke naam daal dete hai jo us aparaadh se sidhe taur par jude hue bhi nahin hai
 Considering that only 15 percent of the people in dowry harassment cases get punished, this decision of the court is commendable
 isse nirdosh log anaavashyak rup se jail jane se batch jaaenge or maamla darj karaane waalon kii sankhya bhi giregi kyonki juthi shikaayat karne vaale log nirutsahit bhi honge
 The decision of the Supreme Court related to fatwas is also very important in the sense that it has been very popular in the country
 alpsankhyakon ke kai maamalon main kai baar maulavee yaa sanstha ne fatve jari karte hai jo kaaphi vivaadaaspad hote hai
 It is like running an independent court in a way
 isliesupreme court ne in par bandish lagaai he or kaha he ki inhen maananaa jaruri nahin he or desh main sharia adaalaton ko kanoonee manyata nahin he
 He has the right to give opinions but he cannot violate anyone's fundamental rights
 usase kisi ko aise kisi vyakti ke bare main fatwa jari karne kaa haq nahin he jo uske saamne na ho or fatve se kisi begunaah ko takalif nahin pahunchni chahie
 This decision will also put an end to the many years of controversy over the fatwa and give rise to a healthy tradition in which innocent people will not be tortured
 dahej kanoon kaa maamla bhi ajeeb tha
 a law designed to protect innocent people had become a weapon of injustice and Najane was sacrificing many innocents
 bharat main kanoonon ke durupyog kii yah bhi ek dukhad dastaan he
 Now this face of the Supreme Court will take a break in it and will stop the mentality of trapping or harassing others
 film ham dil de chuke sanam main ajay devgan apni patni ko uske premi se milaane ke liye puri film main prayasarat rahete he lekin antat jab milane kaa samay aata he to patni ko apane pati se pyaar ho jaataa he or vah premi ke bajaay apane pati kii ho jaati he, yah kahani to filmi he lekin uttar pradesh ke faijabad jile main phool, chandaore suraj kii kahani ne filmi patakatha ko bhi bahut peeche chhod diya he
 This story also has more dedication than love
 patni kii khushiyon ke liepati kii qurbaani he to premi ke liye us pyaar ko paane kii khushiyaan bhi hai jo pyaar uske bajaay kisi or ke ghar ko mahakaa rahaa tha, lekin aisa kuch hua jo aksar dekhne or sunne ko nahin miltaa
 The incident of Faizabad in UP is in Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh where a man got his wife married to her lover for the happiness
 faijabad ke chore bazaar ke rahane vaale phoolchand kaa vivaah do saal pehle paas ke hi gaanv kii rahane vaali chanda se hua tha lekin chandaa kisi or ko prem karti thi
 The people of the house gave the wedding to Chanda against her wish
 shaadi ke kuch dinon baad jab phoolchand kaam ke silsile main baahar gaya to chandaa kaa premi gaanv pahunch gaya
 The love affair between the two started again and when Phoolchand returned to his village after two years, his wife told everything truthfully
 haalanki pehle to phoolchand naaraaz hua lekin baad main patni kaa doosraa vivaah uske premi se karaane kii soch lee
 Calling Pradhan and got married, Foolchand said, "I was married to Chanda, i thought how happy she should be but she was not satisfied with him
 vah suraj se pyaar karti he isliye yahi sochakar main usase shaadi kara de rahaa hum
 i called Suraj himself and called Pradhan to get married
 'aasaan nahin tha ye kamphulchand ke liye ye itnaa aasaan nahin tha lekin apni patni kii khushi ke liye usne usne apane jajbaton kaa galaa ghont diya
 With the help of the village headman and some other people, Suraj reached the home of the family
 suraj kii baraat phoolchand ke gaanv ai or phir gaanv ke hi ek mandir main donon kaa vivaah dhoomdhaam se karaayaa gaya
 Suraj's father Mata Prasad said that he has only one son
 uski khushi ke liye vah kuch bhi karte
 He got the son married wherever he wanted

 ramalala virajman devtaa hai, duusari jagah wo kehete hai ki sampatti ke maalik hai

 com / o3steqxlsn Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar met just before the ncp-congress agreed on almost all issues to form a government with the Shiv Sena and on Friday, the leaders of both the parties in Mumbai rested allies
 Will talk to congress netaa prithviraj chavaan ne press conference main bataaya ki sahyogi dalon se baatcheet ke baad shivasena ke saath bhi baat hogi or tab ham yah jaankaree de paaenge ki gathbandhan kaisaa hoga
 According to sources, there are reports that there may be an agreement between the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party to hold the post of Chief Minister for two-and-a-half years
 vahiin, congress ko upmukhyamantri pad mil saktaa he
 Earlier, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the three parties would go to meet the Governor on Saturday
 raut ne kaha ki kaha ki rajyapal se milane kaa vakt maanga jayega or unhen congress, shivasena or ensipi vidhayakon ke samarthan kii chitthee di jaaegi

 team india or afghanistan ke bich asia cap 2018 kaa super-4 muqabla aaj shaam 5 baje se dubai international stadium main khelaa jayega
 So far, the Indian team, which has won 4 consecutive matches, will have an expert team in the vicissitudes like Afghanistan
 rohit brigade kaa lakshya afghanistan ko bhi maat dekar maujuuda toornament main jeet kaa panch lagane kaa hoga
 India is in form, India has won the Super-4 by winning both their matches so far and have secured a place in the final
 is match main haalanki wo afghanistan ko bilkul bhi halke main nahin le saktaa
 Because in every way India will try to continue its winning order so that it goes into the final with a positive mindset
 vahiin, afghanistan ke liye yah match ek tarah se saakh kii ladaai he
 He would like to win the match and end the tournament victorious
 26 sitambar ko pakistan or bangladesh kii timen abu dhabi main bhidengi
 Afghanistan's team are at the bottom without any points, losing both their matches in the table
 pakistan or bangladesh donon ke do-do ank hai
 In such a situation, even if Afghanistan wins, it is unlikely to go to the finals
 kyonki udhar pakistan or bangladesh main jo team jeetegi wo final main hogi or agar match radd bhi ho jaataa he to donon tiimon ko ek-ek ank milegaa or phir net ran rate ke aadhaar par jo team aage hogi wo final khelegi
 In this picture, Afghanistan is not in the final race even after winning the match
 bharat ke liye abhi tak uski ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon acchhee chal rahi hai, lekin is match main bhartiya ballebaajon ko saavdhaan rahanaa hoga kyonki afghanistan ke paas is samay kaa sabase acha spin gendbaaji akraman maujuud he
 He has the trio of Mujib ur Rehman, Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi who can destroy any batting attack
 yah teenon milakar na sirf wicket nikaalte hai balki ranon par bhi ankush lagaate hai
 On the strength of this Tigdi, Afghanistan defeated Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
 pichley do maichon main bhi pakistan or bangladesh ke khilaaf in teenon ne apni team ko match jita hi diya tha
 However in the end Afghanistan lost both matches due to lack of experience
 aise main bhartiya ballebaajon ko in teenon ke khilaaf saavdhaan rahanaa hoga or vishesh ranneeti ke saath utarana hoga
 The good thing for India is that the bat of both its captain Rohit Sharma and vice-captain Shikhar Dhawan is speaking out fiercely
 donon ne pichley match main pakistan ke khilaaf shatak jamaaye hai
 Both of them are consistently playing good innings
 in donon ke alaava haalanki kisi or ballebaaj ko krij par samay bitaane kaa zyada mauka nahin mila he
 Ambati Rayudu is definitely contributing well by coming in at number three
 vahiin chauthe number ke saath rohit lagaataar prayog kar rahe hai
 Rohit has also fielded Dinesh Karthik and Mahendra Singh Dhoni at this number
 baaki ballebaajon kaa zyada ballebaaji na karnaa afghanistan ke khilaaf ek bharat kaa ek nakaaratmak pahalu ho saktaa he
 If Rohit and Dhawan are dismissed early, then the entire line will come down the middle order and lower order
 haalanki raidu, dhoni, karthik or kedaar jadhav sabhi team ko sankat se ubaarane kaa madda rakhte hai
 The road is not easy for Afghanistan, and if we talk about Indian bowlers, then only a few batsmen of Afghanistan can become a cause for concern
 hasamtullah shahidi, captain asagar afgaan, ihsaanullah or mohammad shahzad afghanistan ke mukhya ballebaaj hai
 If these four bowlers are dismissed quickly, then Afghanistan can be prevented from reaching a good score
 beete kuch maichon main raashid khan ne balle se bhi acchhee paariyaan khelin hai or vah bhi bhartiya gendbaajon kii naak main dam kar sakate hai
 The passes for India however are fast bowlers like Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jaspreet Bumrah who have been instrumental in bringing the team early success on most occasions
 vahiin madhya ke overon main rabindra jadeja, kuldeep yadav or yujavendra chahal kii tigadi afghanistan ko ek acha score banane se roak sakati he
 One thing India needs to keep in mind is that if Afghanistan bats first, do not let it reach 250 because Afghanistan has vigorously defended this goal on many occasions
 beshak bhartiya team prabandhan ne is baat par dhyaan diya hoga or yah salaah di hogi ki afghanistanko 200 ke takreeban roka jaae
 Both teams-india: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shikhar Dhawan (vice-captain), Lokesh Rahul, Ambati Rayudu, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Dinesh Karthik, Deepak Chahar, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , Jaspreet Bumrah, Siddharth Kaul and Khalil Ahmed
 afghanistan:asagar afgaan (captain), mohammad shahzad (wicketiper), rahamat shah, insanullah janat, hashatamullah shahidi, mohammad nabi, gulbadin nib, raashid khan, aftab alam, mujeeb ur rahamaan, javed ahmadi, munir ahamed, najibullah jaadaraan, sayed shirizad, vafaadaar or shamiullah shenavari

 nigam ko kaaphi samay se mal or aspataalon main aane vaale logon se parking shulk liye jane kii shikaayat mil rahi thi
 The order was passed in 2015 to tell you that in the year 2015 itself, South MCD had issued orders to make parking in hospitals and malls completely free
 lekin iske baavjood kai jagahon se sashulk parking kii shikaayat saamne aane ke baad or haal hi main hoicourt se notice milane ke baad south emsidi ek baar phir se apane aadesh ko sakhti se lagu karwaane main lag gai he

 Legal experts say the court has an option to take action against Musharraf if he does not appear before the judge on the next hearing
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki aarope patr main musharraf ko mukhya aaropee nahin banaaya gaya he or unhen poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa ja rahaa he

 beg ne kaha ki adaalat anupasthiti main musharraf ke khilaaf kaarywahi sanchalit kar sakati he or agar aparaadh se unako jodne vaala koi saboot miltaa he to aadesh bhi jari kar sakati he

 Nobody has ever misunderstood his immense wealth and high political penetration
 unke kaale karnaamon ke dheron kagajaat varshon se mukhyamantri karyaalay, sibisiidi, iskar vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay main pade rahe hai
 Despite this, his health was not affected
 jab uttar pradesh main mayawati kii sarkaar thi, tab ve noida athurity kaa chif ejeeniyar the or unhone jamkar paisa kamaaya
 In 2012, a new government of Akhilesh Yadav came and pretended to screw over it
 sibisiidi jaanch bhi hui, lekin unhen fatafat clinit mil gai
 Along with Noida, the Chief Engineering of Greater Noida Authority and Yamuna Expressway Authority were also found in the gifts
 1,000 karod ru
 Yadav Singh, who is said to be the owner of wealth, is a government machine to earn money, which no government of Uttar Pradesh could even try to marginalize, far from being punished
 aakhir itnaa paisa koi akele thode hi khaataa he, koi na koi siyaasi aakaa to hoga jiske paas rishwat kii rakam kaa bada hissaa pahunchataa he

 People also saw the cash coming out
 aise main lag rahaa he ki ek bahut badi bhrasht machhlee iskar vibhaag ke hathe chadhi he
 But neither have they been arrested so far, nor are they likely to be arrested in the current situation
 iskar vibhaag jin praavdhaanon ke tahat karrwai kar rahaa he, usamen yadav singh ko apni kaali kamai par adhiktam 30 fisadi tex chukaana hoga or isse zyada kuch nahin
 After that they will again become white collar
 ve jail tabhi jaaenge jab nai exiar ke baad pravartan nideshaalay (idi) un par karrwai shurukare
 Or somehow they come on the radar of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) created by the Supreme Court on black money
 isiilie yadav singh is koshish main lage hai ki idi kii karrwai se pehle unke khilaaf uttar pradesh sarkaar visilence jaanch baitha de taaki maamla unke liye mahfuj lakhanu ke galiyaaron se baahar na jaae
 Because even before that Rs 950 crore

 But then he persuaded a leader to investigate the state government's CBCID so that the matter could be resolved easily
 sibisiidi ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki is deal ke evaj main us netaa ko noida sector 37 main ek hotel uphaar main diya gaya tha, jisaki keemat karodon ru
 It is said
 (mayawati ke raaj main yadav singh kii tuuti bolti rahi or aarope lage or akhilesh ke kaarykaal main use bari kar diya gaya)2012 main yadav singh ke khilaaf bhoomi ghotaale kii jaanch main shaamil rahe ek police afasar kehete hai, ‘‘unka siyaasi rasookh is kadar tha ki unke varisht adhikari bhi unke faislon par ungali nahin uthaate the
 In this way, they continued to allot valuable land to their people

 When the Mayawati government came to the state for the first time in 1995, in 1995, the promotion of 19 engineers was promoted and Yadav Singh, posted as Assistant Project Engineer, was promoted to the post of Project Engineer
 saath hi unhen degree hasil karne ke liye teen saal kaa samay bhi diya gaya
 In the year 2002, Yadav Singh got the post of Chief Maintenance Engineer (CME) in Noida
 agle nau saal tak ve siemai ke pad par hi tainaat rahe, jo praadhikaran main ejineering vibhaag kaa sabase bada pad tha
 By this time, the CME had three positions in the authority

 This was followed by Anand's seizure of Rs 400 crore

 Now, in the case of Yadav Singh, action seems to be increasing in the same direction

 Both of these are big investigative agencies from the state government
 iskar vibhaag kii report aane ke baad hi rajya sarkaar yadav singh ke khilaaf koi karrwai karegi
 On the other hand, sources in the Income Tax Department say that Yadav Singh's passport has been confiscated
 is baat kaa andeshaa tha ki ve nepal yaa malaysia bhaag saktaa he, jahaan kathith taur par unka paisa laga he
 Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has also received two sensitive diaries
 pehali diary unke noida vaale ghar se mili, jisamen unhone apane gaiyr-kanoonee lenden kaa zikr kiya he
 The second diary was found in a locker of a bank in Delhi

 IT director (investment) Ashok Kumar Tripathi said, "yadav Singh and his share holders have so far earned Rs 50 crore

 Soon we will open their locker and hope to get more information from there

 Who does not like the fragrance of soil after the drops of rain fall on the ground, but have you ever wondered where this scent comes from? Scientists have found the answer to this question
 darasal, jameen ko sparsh karne se pehle barish kii buundon main koi khushboo nahin hoti, lekin jaise hi yah dhulakanon se milti he, ham ek sondhi-si khushboo mahasoos karte hai
 This fragrance is called 'patricor', which is derived from the Greek word petra, meaning stone or icar
 mana jaataa he ki yah vahi taral he, jo ishwar kii nason main rakt ke rup main bahata he
 Cullen Bui, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, said, 'actually, some oily substances emitted by plants and some special chemicals emitted by bacteria react with the raindrops, which results in such a fragrant scent
 Feel
 ’barish kii boonden jaise hi jameen par chhidrayukt sataha par girti hai, vah hawa ke chote-chote bulabulon main tabdeel ho jaati he
 These bubbles move upward before they burst and eject tiny particles in the air, known as 'aerosols'

 - input IANS se Former Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh is a veteran of the state who has neither been defeated by allegations of corruption nor was the Congress stunned by mutual differences
 apane jabardast prachaar abhiyaan ke baad veerabhrad congress ko rajya main phir satta main waapas le aaye hai
 Virbhadra is ready to become the Chief Minister of the state for the sixth time
 aisa hua to yah unka ek ricard hoga
 In his five decades of political career, Virbhadra has been an MLA seven times, Member of Parliament five times and Chief Minister five times
 vah chaar baar congress ke pradesh adhyaksh rah chuke hai or maujuuda loksabhaa main mandi sasandiy kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Virbhadra has been Chief Minister from 1983 to 1985, 1985 to 1990, 1993 to 1998 and 2003 to 2007
 aaj unhone jeet darj karne ke baad kaha, ‘ congress adhyaksha hi tay karengi ki mukhyamantri koun banegaa
 For Virbhadra, this election was the biggest challenge in his political life
 unke liye yah aar yaa paar kii ladaai thi kyonki vah akele maidan main the jin par lagaataar bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaaye ja rahe the
 Himachal Congress, a victim of differences, has won under his leadership when the party is under attack on corruption and inflation at the Center
