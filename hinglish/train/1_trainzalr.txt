ujadaa karte hai
 
 
 The cities do not cry
 
 
 vahaan kancreet kii imaaraten hai bade-bade brij hai
 
 
 How can they cry 
 
 shahar royaa nahin karte
 
 
 But today these cities
 
 
 jise chennai kehete hai khun ke aansu ro rahaa he
 
 
 The flood has forced it to sob
 
 
 barish ke pani main aansuon kaa namak ghul gaya he
 
 
 Today, a city sank to its knees in mud and water
 
 
 
 Seeing himself disintegrating
 
 
 thik he shahar he
 
 
 But every city also has a heart
 
 
 uski god main naa jane kahaan- kahaan se aae logon ko thor milti he
 
 
 Two times' bread is available
 
 
 jindagi jeene ke liye roji milti he
 
 
 Today the same city is in mourning
 
 
 jo shahar kal tak itaraata tha
 
 
 There was pride of South India
 
 
 chaar mahanagaron main jiskaa naam tha
 
 
 That Chennai slowly - slowly saw itself desolate
 
 
 insaan se lekar jaanwaron tak par afat dekhi
 
 
 It is said that water is one of the most important things to live
 
 
 panchtatv main ek jal bhi hota he
 
 
 But today the same water
 
 
 chennai ko rone ke liye majaboor kar diya
 
 
 Today a city is crying silently
 
 
 ye ek shahar kaa shok he
 
 
 This is the weeds of a city
 
 
 
 Please do not weigh this weeds in the figures
 
 
 iske bashindon ke dukhon kaa hisaab mat lagaaiye
 
 
 Because everything is made in the world
 
 
 par aisa koi bahikhaata nahin bana
 
 
 Who can calculate the misery
 
 
 chennai main aaj dukh kaa antaheen sailaab najar aata he
 
 
 a city today is crying tears of truth, not of blood
 
 
 ye chennai kaa gam he
 
 
 But the eyes are moist for the whole country
 
 
 ye shahar to shaan tha
 
 
 
 itihaas main isaki jaden bahut gahari thim
 
 
 Expectations for the future were high
 
 
 lekin chand roj kii barish ne shahar ko tabaahi main jhonk diya
 
 
 We understand human pain every day
 
 
 lekin ho sake to ek shahar ke dard ko aaj mahasoos kiijie
 
 
 Your heart will also break
 
 
 aapaki ankhen bhi geeli ho jaaengi
 
 
 Your pain will also go away
 
 
 chennai kaa sailaab kuch aisa hi he
 
 
 Think for yourself, which city used to run day and night
 
 
 wo shahar aakhir roe nahin to kya kare
 
 
 Before 1639 when Chennai was not Madras
 
 
 tab chota sa gaanv hua karata tha
 
 
 It was known by the name Madrasapatnam
 
 
 tab se lekar ajtak shahar failata gaya
 
 
 Climbed the stairs of progress 
 
 
 The face of the city changed and the name changed
 
 
 lekin aaj sailaab ne is shahar ko dard ke dariyaa main dubo diya he
 
 
 Gave so much sorrow to this city
 
 
 jo bhar to jaaenge
 
 
 But these cities hardly forget these tears
 
 
 shahar ko jeene kaa salika aata he wo jeena phir se sikh legaa
 
 
 But he could hardly forget this scene

 Known for its lakes, Bhopal is now set to develop on the lines of other metros
 simit jameen or badhati aabaadi ke chalate ab shahar ko vertical growth ke bare main vichaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 Even though the Ganga-skyscrapers are not visible in this capital of Madhya Pradesh, but soon the highrise buildings will also be seen in Bhopal
 sarkaar ne janvari 2013 main hyrise buildingon kii oonchai 12 meter se badhaakar 30 meter tak karne ko manjuuri de di he
 The height of the building can be increased according to the available roads
 bhopal ke master plan 2005 main sanshodhan kar ye praavdhaan lagu kiye gaye hai
 Hundreds of schemes were stuck due to these provisions, which are now expected to be approved
 is shahar kii sabase badi imaarat lila sans bilders kanha tower ke naam se arera colony kshetra main bana rahe hai
 The building has 15 floors with 252 flats with three and four rooms
 bhopal jaise shahar main is tarah kii itani oonchi imaarat pehali baar ban rahi he
 Leela Sons Builders is providing many facilities in this building such as separate places for children and the elderly to spend time
 is building ke bare main daawa he ki yah tej bukamp ke jhatkon ko bhi sah sakati he
 Along with this multi-storey building, many other similar schemes are going to be launched in the city
 isse pehle ab tak kii sabase oonchi imaarat kaa nirmaan madhya pradesh houseing board ne platinum plaza ke rup main kiya tha, jisamen 10 manjilon kii awasaiya building or saat manzil kii vyavsaayik imaarat he
 The State Government has implemented the Land Development Rules, 2012
 lekin bhopal master plan 2005 ke chalate bahut se niyamon ko yahaan lagu nahin kiya gaya tha
 Therefore, now the government has to include many provisions in the master plan
 nae praavdhaan ke mutabik ab bilders ko parking ke liye pehle ke mukaable doguni jagah uplabdh karwaani hogi
 Along with this, the width of the roads is also at least 7
 5 meter rakhni hogi, jo pehle 6 meter hi thi
 Bhopal's real estate group AG8 Akruti Group is also developing a 35-acre colony called Akruti foundation in Misrod, the city
 isamen bhi 15 manjila rahvaasee complex kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Company Chairman Hemant Kumar Soni says, "due to government rule in a city like Bhopal, big buildings have not been built yet
" ab shahar ke madhya main 18 meter tak kii imaaraton kii anumati di ja rahi he
 But the floor area ratio (FAR) is not being increased
 jisase bilderon or kharidaaron ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 "sony further adds," If the FAR is increased, it will truly reduce the problem of land to a great extent
 iske saath hi ham kharidaaron ko bhi phayda pahunchane kii sthiti main honge

 aamtaur par in jagahon par booking karaane vaale log ucch madhyavarg se aa rahe hai
 30 lakh to 50 lakh in Bhopal's highrise buildings
 tak main flats uplabdh hai
 The government is increasing the height of highrise buildings to promote vertical development
 lekin ekher nahin badaye jane kii vajah se bilders or developers ab bhi khush najar nahin aa rahe
 Manoj Pradhan, CMD of the Sheetal Group, which has built around 4,000 houses in the city, says, "increasing the height of the buildings will not end the problem of the place
 iske liye sarkaar ko ekher badhaane kaa nirnay lenaa padegaa
 The government should increase the FAR to prevent commercial and residential use of agricultural land
 shahar kaa vikaas agar anya mahanagaron kii tarj par karnaa he to bhi sarkaar ko ekher par nirnay lenaa hi padegaa varanaa vertical vikaas ke bare main sochna bemaani he
 “FAR is the ratio of the total area of the roof of a house to the total area of that land
 ekher kaa praavdhaan master plan main kshetravaar kar diya jaataa he or usee aadhaar par nagar nigam nirmaan kii anumati detaa he
 According to this if you have an area of 5,000 square feet and FAR 1
 25 he to aap 6,250 varg foot kshetra par nirmaan kar sakate hai
 The builders are also unhappy that the government has set up to 30 meters to build the highrise building is not for the main areas in a city like Bhopal
 vahaan sirf 18 meter tak kaa hi nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Only 18 meters of construction will be allowed in areas such as MP Nagar, New Market, Arera Colony, Airport Road
 30 meter kaa praavdhaan baahar ke un ilaakon main he jo abhi viksit ho rahe hai
 The builders warn that this will lead to unplanned growth

 Iran and Turkish media were also making similar claims
 lekin, iraqi media kaa kahana he ki hamale main bagdadi ghayal hua he naa ki maaraa gaya he
 Now the question is, is the world's most dreaded terrorist really killed or is it an excuse for his death? The news of Baghdadi's death came on June 9, on the evening of June 9, the us-led coalition army got the news that ISIS Kingpin Abu Bakr al Baghdadi is on his way to Syria from Raqqa hiding in a convoy of cars along with some other big commanders

 Three days after the attack near the border of Iraq and Syria, there is a sudden news that the 9 June airstrike killed the biggest ISIS leader, Baghdadi

 ISIS news agency claimed Baghdadi's death This is the fourth death in two years of the most dreaded terrorist and ISIS Chief, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, who has caused worldwide death and terror in the name of establishing Islamic rule

 This was the time when Baghdadi showed pictures of a British journalist cutting the throat on the camera and showed the whole world
 tab pehali baar iesas kaa zaalim cheharaa jamaane ne dekha tha
 This was followed by the news of Baghdadi being first wounded and then dead in an airstrike, but about a month after this news came to light, the audio of Baghdadi surfaced on November 13, 2014 and he himself denied the death

 Apart from Radio Iran, two Iraqi news agencies Alagad Press and al-yum al-tameen had the same claim, but in July 2015, evidence of Baghdadi's resurrection came to light almost three months later

 The report claimed that while Baghdadi was injured in this airstrike on a ISIS convoy, three of his companions were killed, but within a month the news of this third death of Baghdadi also turned out to be false

 Pandit Nehru's contribution to the history of India can never be forgotten
 desh kii aazaadee ke sangharsh se lekar swatantra bharat main loktantr ko sinchakar vat vriksh ke bhaanti use majboot kar, raashtra or samvidhan ke dharmanirpeksh charitra ko aakaar dene or aarthik yojanaon ke madhyam se desh kii arthvyavastha kii buniyaad rakhane vaale ek bejod shilpi to the hi utane hi bejod kalamkaar bhi the
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad
 bacchon ke pyaare ‘chachaa nehru’ ke upnaam se lokapriy nehru kaa vyaktitv apane aap main kisi granth se kam nahin hai
 He got an opportunity to study in the best schools and universities in the world
 apni schuli shiksha england ke hero se praapt karne ke baad unhone cambridge ke trinity college main daakhila liya
 Here he graduated in life science after studying for three years
 iske baad unhone landan ke ins of court skool of lau, inner temple se vakaalat kii padhai kii
 It is no less important that despite being the only son of a very well-known and established lawyer, Pandit Motilal Nehru, and having achieved such degrees, the young Pandit Nehru left the Jawahar advocacy and went to jail for 9 times
 unako 11 baar nobel shanti puraskaar ke liye namit kiya gaya gaya
 However, in Sahitya Aaj Tak, we will talk about Pandit Nehru's creative activities rather than political and administrative achievements
 vah ek prakhar vaktaa va adhyavsaayee to the hi, unhone bhartiya academik va sahitya jagat ko bhi anginat rachanaaon se samrudh kiya
 His works include 'the Discovery of India', Bharat Ek Khoj in Hindi, 'glimpses of World History and Biography' Toward Freedom
 da discovery of india ko unhone apane karawas ke dauraan ahmednagar kii jail main 1944 main likhaa tha
 Later this book was translated into Hindi and many other languages

 is kitaab kii rachana ke saath hi nehru bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke mahanayake ke saath-saath vishwa ke mahanatam lekhakon kii category main gine jane lage
 In this book, Nehru has written in a unique language style linking the past of India's multifaceted rich culture, religion and ancient heritage, from the Indus Valley Civilization to the independence of India, with scientific vision
 pandit nehru ne hameshaa is baat par jor diya or kaha ki hamaara ateet hamaare bhavishya kaa path pradarshak hota he
 Due to this wide panorama of his perspective, this book covers many different subjects like the gradual development of civilization, philosophy, art, social movement, finance, science and religion
 is kitaab par ek bahucharchit televijan siries ‘bharat ek khoj’ bhi ban chuki he
 Another famous book is 'letters from a Father to His Daughter' by Pandit Nehru
 jail main rahete hue unhone 146 patr beti indira ko likhe
 The Hindi translation of this book was done by the great storyteller, novelist Samrat Munshi Premchand
 in khaton se pan
 Nehru's depth of creativity and imagination is evident
 saath hi yah bhi ki vah kitni sadgipurn or oonchi soch vaale vyakti the
 His works include the unfettered form of India's history, philosophy, society, culture, religion and nature, but also the world history, society, religion, philosophy, literature and culture
 unki rachanaaon ko padhakar aise lagata he ki apni kitabon main unhone samoochee duniya ke chappe-chappe kaa gyaan udel diya ho
 Pandit Nehru said goodbye to this world on 27 May 1964
 bhale hi aaj vah ham sabake bich nahin hai, lekin bharat hi nahin duniya ke samast sahishnu, pragatisheel va udaaravaadi soch vaale vyaktiyon ke dilon main ve aaj bhi loktantric, samvidhan sammat, maanavtaavaadi saamaajik-raajnneetik-aarthik darshan or apni amar kritiyon ke saath jinda hai
 The mud, dirt, abuses, stigmas, etc
 are being flown on Nehru, instead of being muddy, they appear to glow brightly
 yahaan pandit naheru kii raashtra ko saunpi gai aakhri vasiyat, jo unhone 21 june, 1954 ko likhi thi or jise unke nidhan ke baad 03 june, 1964 ko prasaarit kiya gaya, kaa zikr bhi jaruri he
 In it, he wrote- "I want my handful of ashes to be shed in the confluence of Prayag which goes to the sea kissing the daemon of Hindustan, but the greater part of my ash is taken up by airplane and scattered in the fields, The farm where thousands of toiling people are engaged in work, so that every aspect of my existence becomes one in the land of the world
 " # noteh lekhak kaa naam pard kar chaunkiye nahin
 This is the hallmark of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's influence on Indian society
 sahitya ajtak se intern ke rup main jude lekhak kaa naam uske dada ne pandit nehru ke naam par rakhaa tha

 17veen loksabhaa ke gathan ke liye 543 siton par saat charnon main chunaav sampann ho chuke hai
 Narendra Modi will get the chair of power again or the country will get a new Prime Minister, it will be decided on 23 May
 vahiin iske pehle aaj iviem main gadabadi ke mudde par 22 vipakshi dalon ke netaa chunaav ayog ke saath baithak karenge
 During the election, there were several occasions where opposition parties objected to the decision of the Election Commission
 vipakshi partiyon ne kabhi bijepi ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope lagaaya to kabhi chunaav ayog ko hi kathghare main khadaa kar diya
 Let us tell you the occasion when the opposition parties got attacked on the Election Commission
 piem modi or amit shah ko clin chitapiem narendra modi or bijepi chif amit shah dwaara aachaar samhita todane kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog se clin chit milane par vipakshi partiyaan hamalaa bol chuki hai
 The Congress had said that the Election Commission has become the puppet of Narendra Modi
 chunaav ayukta ashok lavasa kii chitthiyon se khulaasa hua ki mukhya chunaav ayukta or lavasa ke bich modi-shah ko clin chit die jane par mat alag the
 Several other opposition parties made it an issue and asked the Election Commission to take strict measures
 bengal main prachaar kaa samay ghatanasatven charan kii voting se pehle bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hinsak pradarshan hue, jisamen vidyasagar college main todphod kii gai or mahaan samaaj sudhaarak ishwar chandra vidyasagar kii murti tut gai
 After this, the Election Commission, taking a historic decision, used Article 324 for the first time and cut the election campaign for 9 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal by 19 hours
 is faisle ko lekar vipaksh chunaav ayog ke khilaaf khadaa ho gaya
 Mamta Banerjee had said that i never saw the Election Commission filled with RSS
 iske alaava congress or makapa ne kaha ki agar hinsa ke maddesner prachaar rokane kii naubat aa gai thi to guuruuvaar tak ayog intjaar kyon kar rahaa he
 Questions on holding long elections: Opposition parties also raised questions over the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal in seven phases
 biju janata dal, argedy samet kai partiyon kaa kahana tha ki bhaajapa ko phayda pahunchane ke liye chunaav ayog ne itane charnon kaa kaarykram banaaya he
 It is worth noting that in the last election, elections were held in 5 phases in West Bengal
 bihar main pichhali baar 6 charnon main chunaav hue the, jo is baar 7 charnon main hue
 The argument was also given that when elections can be held for 48 seats of Maharashtra in 4 phases and 39 seats of Tamil Nadu in one phase, then p
 bengal kii 42 siton par chunaav saat charan main kyon ho rahe hai
 Opposition parties accused the BJP of favoring the Election Commission
 khud congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi yah baat kah chuke hai
 He said in the statement that the Election Commission is soft in BJP matters while being completely biased in opposition matters
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki nirvachan ayog jo bhi kare, janata ne man bana liya he to koi kuch nahin kar saktaa
 But it cannot be ignored that the Election Commission is not performing its responsibility properly
 nateezon se pehle iviem par sawalsabhi agsit pole main jis tarah bhaajapa ko prachand bahumat diya ja rahaa he
 Opposition parties are shocked by this
 haalanki nattejey 23 may ko aane hai lekin vipakshi partiyaan chunaav ayog jane kii taiyaariyaan kar chuki hai
 Today, the opposition parties will hold a meeting with the Election Commission on the issue of evms and vvpats
 is baithak kii aguai chandrababu naidu karenge, jo pehle bhi iviem main gadabadi ko lekar nirvachan ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataate rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi also tweeted about this
 unhone likhaa, chunavi band or iviem se lekar chunaav kii tareekhen tay kiye jane tak main chaalaaki kii gai, namo tivi, 'modi army' or ab kedarnath main drama, chunaav ayog kaa pradhanmantri or unki mandali ke aage samarpan sabhi hindustaniyon ke saamne spasht he

 After the terrorist attack on CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, there has been debate once again on the facilities available to the paramilitary forces
 vahiin duusari ore 3 march ko desh ke alag-alag rajyon se ritred ardhsainik bal dilli ke jantar-mantar pahunch rahe hai
 Actually, these people demand that the old pension scheme should be implemented instead of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) they get
 yahaan bataa den ki atal bihari bajpeyi kii sarkaar ne 2004 se puraani pension skim ko khatm kar neshnal pension skim lagu kiya
 The question is what is the NPS, after which the paramilitary forces want to restore the old pension
 saal 2004 se pehle CRPF or biguef samet anya ardhsainik bal ke javaanon ke liye laabhakaari pension yojana lagu thi
 In the old pension scheme, the employee was not required to pay anything from his salary
 vahiin javaanon ko ritairement ke baad antim maah main mili vetan kaa kareeb 50 fisadi pension ke rup main milane lagata tha
 But from 1 January 2004, the National Pension Scheme (NPS) was implemented for government employees, including paramilitary forces
 is yojana ke tahat ardhsainik balon ke mul vetan kaa kareeb 10 fisadi karmchaaree ko dena hota he or 14 fisadi paisa sarkaar detii he
 Here, let us know that after retirement, the army is given pension under the old system only
 bhartiya sena ke javaanon ko ardhsainik bal ke javaanon se zyada suvidha milti he, isamen canteen, army skool aadi kii sevaayen shaamil he
 Earlier, the government used to help 10 percent
 Earlier, the contribution from the central government to the NPS was 10 percent, but last year it was announced to increase it by 4 percent to 14 percent
 iske saath hi ritairement ke baad nikaali gai 60 fisadi kii rakam ko tex-free kar diya gaya
 Under this scheme, 60% of the total pension fund can be withdrawn at the time of retirement, the remaining 40% can be invested in fixed income products or share equity
 pehle 40 fisadi rakam hi nikaalane kaa praavdhaan tha
 What is the demand for paramilitary forces? Organizations associated with paramilitary forces have been demanding for the past several years that they too get one rank-one pension like the army
 iskaa tark yah hota he ki desh kii aantarik suraksha or seemaa suraksha main bhartiya sena ke saath siarpief, biesaf, itibipi, siaisef, esasabi kaa ahm yogadan hota he
 In such a situation, they should be given the benefit of the old pension scheme equally
 madhya pradesh ke mantri ne digvijay singh par lagaae gambhir aaropakaha- digvijay singh karaate hai avaidh khanan or sharaab taskariarope lagane vaale mantri kii buaa bhi digvijay kii raheen hai virodhimadhya pradesh main digvijay singh par parade ke peeche rahakar kamalnath sarkaar ko chalaane kaa aarope lagaakar van mantri umang singhar ne sansani failaa di he
 He has made such allegations on former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, which till now, even the leaders of the anti-bjp BJP did not make
 sarkaar ke ek pramukh mantri kii ore se party ke varisht netaa digvijay singh par avaidh khanan or sharaab kii taskari jaise gambhir aarope lagane se sthaneey siyasat garma gai he
 Going into the past in the state politics, it is known that Umang Singhar's family has had an old political rivalry with Digvijay Singh
 kabhi madhya pradesh kii upmukhyamantri rahete hue unki buaa jamuna devi tatkaaleen mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke khilaaf morcha kholane ke liye charchit rahi hai
 Jamuna Devi's confrontation with Kamal Nath was then in the limelight in the politics of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan tak ki ek baar jamuna devi ne kah diya tha- "main digvijay singh ke tandoor main jal rahi hum"
 Jamuna Devi, who was recognized as the leader of the tribals in the state, died in 2010
 ab bhattije hai hamalavarbua ke nidhan ke baad se umang singhar madhya pradesh main congress ke pramukh adivasee chehre hai
 He is counted as a young leader full of possibilities
 pradesh ke dhar jile ke gandhvani vidhansabha seat se lagaataar teen baar chunaav jitkar kamalnath sarkaar main mantri bane hai
 Umang Singhar, who is considered close to Rahul Gandhi in Delhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia in the state, has opened a front against former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh for the last few days
 unhone digvijay singh par sarkaar main bevajaah dakhal dene, transfar-posting, blakemeling, avaidh khanan or sharaab taskari jaise gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Umang Singhar is believed to be opposing Digvijay Singh following in the footsteps of his aunt
 kya pratidwandi netaa ko badhaava dene par bhadke umangadigvijay singh ke khilaaf morcha kholane ke peeche dhar jile kii sthaneey raajnneeti bhi ek vajah bataai ja rahi he
 It is being said that Dr
 MLA and Jayas Patron from Manavar seat in Dhar district
 heeralaal ko digvijay singh raajnneeti main pramot kar rahe hai
 Since Hiralal is also the tribal face of the party, Umang Singhar feels that Digvijay Singh is trying to make his political rival a bigger face
 isse umang singhar ko apni raajnneeti prabhavit hone kaa andeshaa sata rahaa he
 If sources are to be believed, all these things have pitted him against Digvijay Singh
 sindhiya-digvijay nurakushti bhi vajahjis tarah se digvijay singh ke khilaaf bolne vaale umang singhar ke saath congress ke varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya khulkar khadey hue hai, usase mana ja rahaa he ki puure ghatnakram ke peeche sindhiya or digvajiy singh ke bich chal rahaa shityudh he
 Scindia and Digvijay Singh have opposed each other on several occasions
 unke bich chal rahaa aapasi virodh kai maukon par bayaanbaji ke rup main saamne bhi aa chukaa he
 Since Kamal Nath is also the Chief Minister and the State President of the party
 is naate unka kareebi hone ke kaaran digvijay singh kii sarkaar or sanghathan donon main chal rahi he
 Whereas Scindia did not get the post even after claiming the chief minister's claim after winning the assembly elections
 virodh ke kaaran ab tak pradesh adhyaksh pad bhi nahin mil sakaa he
 This makes Scindia's camp feel weak both in the government and the organization
 sutara bataate hai ki yah baat sindhiya kheme ko nagavar guzar rahi
 There is also a reason for Umang Singhar to open a front against Digvijay Singh
 aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ke ayogyata ke maamle kii chunaav ayog is maamle main jald faisla de sakati he
 These AAP mlas are accused of holding the post of profit, but due to the assembly elections in five states, there was no hearing in these cases after January
 ab 11 march ko paanchon rajyon ke chunaav nattejey ghoshit honge, jiske baad ayog 16 march ko maamle kii antim sunwaayee karegaa
 In addition to these mlas, Secretary of the Election Commission AK Patnaik has sent notice to the complainant advocate Prashant Patel in this case
 notice ke mutabik, ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 16 march ko dopaher 3 baje hogi
 On completion of the hearing, it is expected that in the month of March itself, the Commission can give a decision on this matter
 bataa den ki dilli ke ye21 vidhayakavibhinn mantriyon ke sansadeey sachiv banaae jane ko lekar vivaadon main fanse hue hai
 As per the rules of Delhi Legislative Assembly, only the CM of Delhi can be appointed as Parliamentary Secretary
 vah bhi do se zyaada nahin
 But after the AAP government in Delhi came to power in 2015, 21 mlas were made parliamentary secretaries of all the seven ministers, that is, three secretaries of each minister
 is maamle ne yachikakarta vakil prashanth patel ne ise chunauti di orophis of profitka maamla bataaya
 Patel also sent a petition to the President
 raashtrapati ne maamla chunaav ayog ko bheja
 However, the Delhi High Court has also ruled that mlas in Delhi cannot be made parliamentary secretaries of ministers
 pichley saal usne in saare sansadeey sachivon ko hataane kaa aadesh bhi diya tha

 siem yogi aditnath dwaara lakhanu metro ke udghaatan se pehle iskaa shrey lene ke liye akhilesh yadav ne siyaasi war ched diya
 Although Akhilesh Yadav may have worked to land this project, but the dream of Lucknow Metro was seen by Mayawati
 mayawati ne khwab dekhadarasal lakhanu metro laane kaa khwab upi kii tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mayawati ne dekha tha
 When she was the Chief Minister of the state between 2007 and 2012, in 2011 she took the initiative twice and sent the detailed project report of Lucknow Metro to the then UPA government of the Center
 is project ko us samay manjuuri nahin mil saki thi
 Akhilesh may have seen the dream of the Metro Metro on the ground, even though Mayawati had seen it, but the work of removing it on the ground was done under Akhilesh Raj
 akhilesh yadav ke daur main lakhanu metro ko manjuuri mili
 It was included in Akhilesh's dream project
 yahi vajah thi ki is sapane ko puraa karne main unhone koi kor kasar nahin chodi
 Lucknow Metro project was started by Akhilesh Yadav government in 2013 and completed in 2017
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle lakhanu metro project puri tarah se taiyaar bhi nahin hua tha ki akhilesh yadav ne mahaj do metro stesan ke bich metro kaa udghaatan kar diya
 During the assembly elections, the BJP targeted the previous SP government over the Lucknow Metro
 bijepi ne sawaal kiya tha ki lakhanu main metro abhi bhi kyon nahin chal rahi he
 Amid political rhetoric about Lucknow Metro, former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that the project is yet to get security clearance from Metro Railway Safety
 unka aarope tha ki kendra manjuuri main vilamb kar rahaa he
 That is why the metro is not operational
 udghaatan se pehle akhilesh ne twit karke kaha tha ingine to pehle hi chal diya tha ab keval dibba baaki he
 The engine had already run

 Giving an example, he said, 'in the 2009 general election, the Congress had promised to give three rupees per kg of rice to the poor

 Rehman Malik, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Internal Affairs in Pakistan, on Wednesday rejected India's Home Minister p Chidambaram's statement that the terrorists who attacked Mumbai had 'government support' and said that a 'propaganda campaign' Under ISI is being targeted

 He also said that the role of ISI in the fight against terror "has the support of all the people
" ’unhone chidambaram samet bharat ke netaaon ke un bayanon kaa baar-baar khandan kiya ki mumbai hamale main pakistan sarkaar or sarkaar se itar tatv shaamil the
 Malik called ISI a 'special agency'
 gauratlab he ki chidambaram ne ek bayaan main kaha ki 26 / 11 ko mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale aatankiyon ko spasht taur par sarkaar se sahyog mila tha
 Chidambaram said on Wednesday, 'now when i talk about the people of the government machinery, i am not raising my finger towards any particular agency, but clearly the support of the 26 / 11 Mumbai terror attack or people of the government machinery Was supported by ’unka yah bayaan lashkar-e-taiyaba aatanki abu jandal kii giraftaar or usase poochtacha ke baad aayaa he, jo pakistan sthit ‘niyantran kaksh’ se varsh 2008 main mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale 10 aatankiyon ko nirdesh de rahaa tha

" koun jaanata he ki bharat se kisi ne ek sting oparation kiya ho?’ haalanki unhone ‘sting oparation’ kehane kaa matlab spasht nahin kiya
 In reference to Abu Jindal, Faheem Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, he said, "can these three come to Pakistan and meet the people here
 ve sansaadhan juta kar waapas ja sakate hai or tab mumbai hamalaa hota he
 Therefore any rational investigator will be forced to think
 ’malik ne bhartiya adhikariyon se sandigdh aatanki ke bare main vistrut jaankaree bhi maangi, jisase pakistan jaruri karrwai kar sake
 However, he also said that the authorities and Chidambaram would have to pay attention to the role of Indian citizens like Jindal, Faheem Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed
 malik ne kaha, ‘jabiuddeen bhartiya he, vah bharat main pakadaa gaya, usne sab kuch bharat me kiya
 Then why are you blaming Pakistan? He is your citizen
 iskaa matlab he ki aapaki agenciyaan apane nagarikon ko niyantrit karne main asafal raheen
 Please pay attention to your system as well
 ’unhone kaha ki mumbai hamale main jindal ke shaamil hone kaa matlab he ki ‘koi jasoos he, aapaki vyavastha main bhi kuch khami he
 He also said that the pakistani-american suspected terrorist David Headley, who was in US custody, was an agent who acted in many ways
 ’grahamantri ne kaha ki vah chidambaram kaa bahut sammaan karte hai or bharat ke saath ‘aarope-pratyarope kaa khel’ khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 He said, 'I have not come here to accuse India, i have come here to explain the situation
 ’malik ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat main hue jin paanch aatanki hamalon kaa aarope iesai par lagaaya ja rahaa he, ve hindu ugravadiyon kii ore se kiye gaye hai
 These attacks are the Malegaon blasts of 2006 and 2008, Samjhauta Express blast of 2007, Mecca Masjid blast of 2007 and Ajmer Dargah blast of 2007

 Your own Taliban is emerging
 or ab hamane parinaam dekh liye or main bharat ke liye kaamana karata hum ki kanoon lagu karaane vaali agenciyaan ise rokane ke liye kuch jarur karengi
 Malik also said that he had repeatedly informed him of the spread of Hindu extremism in meetings with Chidambaram
 saath hi unhone chidambaram ko yah bataane kaa bhi daawa kiya, ‘mujhe lagata he ki aapke desh main hindu ugravad kaa prasar ho rahaa he
 We failed to control the Taliban in Pakistan and we are facing it
 kripaya kuch karen
 He said that the families of Pakistani nationals killed in the Samjhauta Express blast are demanding that Indian army officer Colonel SK Purohit, who was involved in the case, be handed over to Islamabad

 Before the 50th anniversary of the 1962 war between India and China, China on Friday said that it wholeheartedly wants to resolve the border dispute with India by negotiation and maintain friendly relations

 In Uttarakhand, not only the activists but also Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat tried to set an example by joining the bjp's Scheduled Caste
 lekin ye sirf koshish maatr hi rah gai
 Because the banquet for which he was invited
 vahaan par sabhi anusuchit jati ke kaaryakartaaon ke gharon se khaanaa banaakar laayaa gaya tha
 Some roti and vegetable were extracted separately from the same food and forensic examination was done
 iske baad mukhyamantri ko khaanaa parosa gaya
 Please tell that the BJP organized this banquet just a day before the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar
 isamen unhone anusuchit jati varg ko sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki ekmaatr bijepi hi he jo unke liye sadaiv khadi rahati he
 The BJP considered all classes to be equal and would not accept discrimination

 But my security would have been tested by this
 saath hi unhone kuldeep senger vaale maamle par bhi yogi sarkaar kaa khulkar samarthan kiya
 He said that the government there has decided
 mujhe lagata he kii vidhayak ek jimmedaar vyakti hota he
 Everyone has their rights
 agar koi kahata he kii mere upar jhuthe aarope lage hai, to thik he
 The Uttar Pradesh government first constituted the SIT and now the case is with the CBI
 vahiin uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kaha kii jab apane hi anusuchit jati sambandhit kaaryakartaaon par mukhyamantri ko bharosa nahin tha
 So they should not go there and insult them
 unhone kaha, 'maine kaha tha kii mai 100anusuchit parivaarake gharon main jaaoongaa or vahiin khaanaa khaauungaa
 i am doing the same
 unhone kaha ki itani rotiyon ke bich or wo bhi khud unki kaaryakartaaon ke gharon se ai rotio main unase kaisaa khatra
 If food came from only one family, it was understandable
 lekin itane khaane main koun kaisaa bhejega ye to vahaan khud khaane vaale ko bhi nahin pataa hoga
 In such a situation it is an insult to them and nothing else

 Yogeshwar Dutt, who lost his first match at the Rio Olympics-2016, is targeted by fans of Bollywood star Salman Khan
 landan olympic ke bronj medalist yogeshwar ko rio main bharat ke liye medal kaa prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha, lekin ve apana pehla hi muqabla mongolian ke resler se haar gaye

 haar or jeet, kisi bhi khel kaa hissaa hoti he, lekin yogeshwar kii is haar par kuch log soshal media par un par chutki lene se nahin chuke
 The comments soshal media par yogeshwar ke khilaaf jo tippanee kii gai hai, unamem se zyaadaatar main bollywood star salmaan khan kaa zikr he
 This indicates that he is a fan of twitter user Salman
 gauratlab he ki salmaan khan ko jab rio olympic ke liye bhartiya dal kaa brands ambesder banaaya gaya tha to yogeshwar ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 He said in a tweet that there are big stars like PT Usha, Milkha Singh in the country who have earned respect for the country, what did this ambassador do in the field of sports
 lagata to yahi he ki rio main yogeshwar ke kamjor pradarshan ko salmaan ke kuch phens is khaas bhartiya pahalwaan par nishaanaa saadhane kaa mauka maan rahe hai
 However, it is certain that the rude language used against Yogeshwar is condemnable
 ek twitor yujar ne likhaa, lagata he ki yogeshwar is mukaable ke liye taiyaar hi nahin the
 If you do Salman and Salman throughout the day, who will be your medal?

 —sun Tzu, Narendra Modi's optimism about the Art of Warpakistan had ended only in October 2014 when Pakistan opened heavy fire on the international border in Jammu and Kashmir
 8 aktubar ko air chif marshall arup rahaa ke ghar air force de kii party main pradhanmantri ke pahunchane se pehle tak suraksha bal pakistan ko munhtod jawaab dene lage the
 If India had wanted, it could have shown its attitude even on that occasion which appeared on Thursday 29 September
 alabatta us munhtod jawaab (jo sachmuch tha bhi) ke baavjood pradhanmantri na keval jald hi sab kuch thik hone kaa bharosa diya balki disambar 2015 main rus se lautate hue lahore main rukkar bahuton ko chaunkaa diya
 This was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Pakistan in ten years and that too suddenly
 bharat to pakistan se lagaataar lard rahaa he
 In the last two years, this war has become intense and permanent, both pseudo and direct
 bharat chahta to isse pehle kii muthbhedon main jeet or ghuspaith kii koshishon ko rokane main mili safalataa ko aaj jaisi tevar-turshi ke saath karaara jawaab bataa saktaa tha lekin bakaul sun tju ke, ''jeetta vahi he jise yah pataa ho ki kab laduya he
 "perhaps this time was the right time for India on many scales when the Line of Control of its restraint could show Pakistan
 sun tju ne yah bhi kaha tha ki hamale kaa kadam tabhi uthaaya janaa chahie jab uske laabh najar aaen
 For Prime Minister Modi, it was not only necessary for his domestic politics but also to maintain India's position in the changing power balance in South Asia
 isi stambh main hamane pichley saptaah likhaa tha ki pakistan se nibatane main bharat ko saahas, sujh or sanyam ko saajha karnaa hoga or apane nunnsaan or jokhim ko nunatam rakhana hoga
 Thursday's action on this scale was bold and restrained
 karrwai aatankiyon ke khilaaf thi or udi hamale ke baad hui thi isliye pakistan ke paas pratikriya ke liye kuch nahin tha
 This action was reported to have taken place directly around the Line of Control
 bharat ne pratyaksh rup se 2003 ke sangharsh viraam ke ulanghan kii ghoshnaa bhi nahin kii or na hi is karrwai ko aage jari rakhane kaa sanket diya
 In doing all this, Modi took a toll in domestic politics and provided pressure valves to the political pressure that was created after the Uri attack
 is abhiyaan ke kootnithik pahalu ranneetik pakshon se zyada mahatvapurn hai jinhone modi ko do took karte hue dikhne par baadhya kiya he
 India's success in diplomatic operations against Pakistan has been mixed after the Uri attack
 bharat ke dabaav ke baavjood rus ne pakistan ke saath sainya abhyaas radd nahin kiya
 China is with Pakistan in the balance of power in South Asia
 saarc ko radd karnaa pratikatmak he lekin usase pakistan ko tatkaal koi sabak milte hue nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Limiting the Indus Agreement or stopping trade relations are steps that will have a long-term impact
 is bich udi hamale ke baad bhi aatanki koshishen or seemaa paar se golabari jari thi
 In this case, it was important for India not only for domestic politics but also according to the strategic situation of South Asia
 ‘‘yadi aap khud ko jaanate hai or dushman ko bhi to phir chaahe saikadon ladaaiyaan hon, nateezon se darane kii jarurat nahin he’’ sun tju kaa yah mantra, darasal, bharat kii agali uljhan kaa sheershak he
 Message was given to Pakistan but the trouble now starts from here
 pradhanmantri modi bharat kii jaruraton, sambhaavnaaon, ummiido or chunautiyon ko bhi jaanate hai or pakistan ke mizaaj or shadyantr ko bhi
 There is no guarantee that the terror factory in Pakistan will be closed after the latest lesson, but there is a fear of its coming forward with double strength
 yadi aisa hua to phir sanyam kii agali niyantran rekha kya hogi?jaahir he modi baar-baar pakistan ke khilaaf yah nahin karnaa chahenge jo unhen is baar karnaa padaa he lekin pakistan apane dizin nahin aajamaayega isaki koi guarantee nahin he
 India can live with tensions with Pakistan but not with confrontation
 pradhanmantri modi ko jald se jald apni sarkaar se jude puure samvaad ko pakistan kii chaaya se nikaal kar growth, vikaas or samruddhi kii taraf laana hoga kyonki isaki anupasthiti main bharat ko hone vaale nunnsaan zyada bade honge
 So perhaps India will eventually have to revert to that old principle of strategy that victory or defeat in the event of an attack are both possible
 ajey hona he to pratiraksha ko majboot karnaa hoga
 Pakistan is a bigger challenge for Narendra Modi than Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Manmohan Singh
 gharelu raajnneeti ke takaaje unamem bangladesh banane vaali indira gandhi dekhnaa chaahate hai jabaki global raajnneeti kii bisaat unase vaajapeyi jaisi sadashyata maangati he or teesri taraf unhen bharat kii ek surakshit or niraapad chhavi banani he taaki log yahaan nivesh or kaarobaar kar saken
 After the crackdown on Pakistan, Modi will now have to strike a very delicate balance of generosity, finesse and aggression, in which he will need political consensus within the country to achieve a conflict-free victory

 1993 ke dhamaakon ne mumbai kii tasviir badal di
 Also changed the underworld
 tab anderworld kaa ek sira aatankwaad se jud gaya or daaud ibrahim international criminal ban jane ke saath saath aatankwaad kii raah par nikal padaa
 This is the reason why Chhota Rajan, who played a crime game with Dawood in the streets of Mumbai, got caught, then there is a question in everyone's mind that when will Dawood come? Now India is waiting for Dawood
 If he had committed a big crime, he would have connected with Siradaud and Chhota Rajan
 lekin 1993 ke dhamaakon ke baad jab bhi mumbai aatankwaad se ghayal hui to usamen bhi pehle pahal daaud kaa hi naam khinchaa gaya
 The electoral issue has become Dawood Underworld Dundaud Ibrahim has become such a big name that America does not fail to mention it
 bharat ne bhi pakistan se baatcheet main har baar daaud kaa naam liya he
 Many times evidence related to Dawood was handed over and now Dawood has even become an election issue
 rajan ko pataa hai daaud ke kai rajchhota rajan ke paas daaud ko lekar kitni jaankaree hai or in jaankariyon kii ab kitni ahmiyat he, ye to nahin kaha ja saktaa lekin is baat main koi do raay nahin he kichhota rajan daaud kaa karibibhi rahaa or dushman bhi
 He knew all the secrets of Dawood
 or aaj bhi uske seene main aise hi kai raaj dafn hai
 Mumbai is waiting for Chhota Rajan
 Dawood's business has spread in more than 50 countries, Chhota Rajan has also spread his business a lot
 ab chota rajan dharaa gaya he to mumbai ko isliye uskaa intjaar he kyonki wo hi shaayad daaud ke kuch aise raaj khol saktaa he, jo ab tak kabhi nahin sune gaye

 Actually, when the Shiv sena-bjp government was in Maharashtra between 1995 and 1999, Gadkari was the Minister of Public Works (PWD) in the state

 After being out of power in Maharashtra, Gadkari founded Purti Group in April 2000 to enter the sugar and power business

 The BJP president told Marathi channel ibn-lokmat on October 20 that his company's books were not such that the bank would lend them, so he sought help from his 'good friend' Dattatreya
 lekin yah baat unki company kii parisampattiyon kii keemat se mail nahin khaati
 However, taking a loan from a company that has benefited during his tenure as a minister, raises serious ethical questions

 Many of the companies whose investments have been claimed in the Purti Group are fake firms with fake addresses

 unhone 23 aktubar ko nagpur main patrakaron se kaha, ''ye sabhi companiyaan niyamon or regulation kaa paalan kar rahi hai
 We feel that there has been some confusion in giving some addresses
 iske myne yah katai nahin hai ki kuch farjivada he
 The eligibility of the directors of some such showy companies is also doubtful

 haalanki, duusare varisht bijepi netaa gadakari kaa bhavishya tay karne kii jimmedaari aresas ke upar chhod rahe hai
 a senior Delhi BJP leader said, "it is only appropriate that Gadkari's Nagpur-based advisors decide whether he wants to see him as party president or not
 aakhirkaar unhone hi gadakari ko duusari baar adhyaksh banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 "this issue can affect the bjp's prospects in the upcoming assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat
" agar party adhyaksh ke chunaav ko bijepi par choda gaya to loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj or rajyasabha main party netaa arun jetali main se kisi ko laayaa saktaa he
 Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar's name has also emerged as a contender for the post of president
 jab gadakari se sampark kiya gaya to unhone safai dene se inkaar kar diya
 He said, "I have already said that i am ready to face the investigation
 '' nagpur main 24 aktubar ko yojit samaaroh main unhone sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat sahit kai sheersh adhikariyon ke saath lambey samay tak baithken kin
 According to sources, Gadkari was asked for an explanation which he has given
 par yah nahin pataa chal paaya he ki isse bhagwat santusht hai yaa nahin
 But the Sangh is considering a respectful farewell to Gadkari
 haalanki, apratyaashit rup se adwani ne 24 aktubar ko unke paksh main kaha ki gadakari par aarope lagaana asal main upie kii apni sarkaar ke khilaaf lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko beasar karne kii koshish he
 Advani said, "the UPA wants to make the entire political group look alike so that its unforgivable sins are minimized and avoided
" meraa maananaa he ki bijepi ko ekadam alag tarah kaa hona chahie or ham lagaae gaye aaropon par kisi bhi aadhaar par bakhshae jane kaa daawa nahin karte
 "advani's statement has led to uneasiness within the party as all the leaders know that Advani and Gadkari are rarely seen on most issues
 adwani ise 31 may, 2012 ko khule taur par apane blog par le aae the
 a few days earlier in the bjp's national executive meeting in Mumbai, it was decided to give Gadkari a second term

 aise hi karodpati or lakhpati jaise shabdon kaa matlab he- karodon yaa lakhon kaa swami
 If one is a lord then the other is logically a slave
 daanpaty jivan main is shabd ko saakaar bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 The word 'swami' itself gives many privileges
 kya yahi 'swami bhav' patiyon ko patniyon par haath uthaane kaa bhi adhikaar de detaa he?yah bhi padhein:bachche ko akelaa chhodte samay in baton kaa rakhen khyalnariwadi kaaryakarta or 'sangat-south asian feminist network' kii salaahkaar kamala bhasin kaa kahana he ki samaaj main jis tarah mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh bad rahe hai, aise main kanoon main badlaav laane se zyada mahatvapurn he ki samaaj apni maansikta main badlaav laae
 She says, 'patriarchal thinking is deeply rooted in all our traditions, my brother grows up on Rakshabandhan even though i have been teaching him for years, taking care of him but on Rakhi he says that i am your Will protect main uski 15 saal se raksha karti aa rahi hum lekin raakhi par mujhe vahiin khadaa kar diya jayega
 a good example is that Indian women observe Karvachauth for the long life of husbands
 agar yahi soch he to america ke sabhi patiyon ko to mar janaa chahie kyonki vahaan mahilaayein karwachouth kaa vrath nahin rakhti hai
 On domestic violence, she says that if the husband is the owner then why should he not kill and the owner can kill and keep him in the right place
 aisa nahin he ki mard ke andar janm se hi hinsa kii bhaavana hoti he
 If this had happened, Mahatma Gandhi and Buddha would not have been there
 60 pratishat jo mard kisi ko nahin maarthe hai, ve bhi mard hote hai
 You say that a man should not cry
 yah unki mardaangi ke khilaaf he
 Humanity and humanity are also being taken away by this
 mahilaayein atyaacharon ko kyon sah leti hai? vah kahati hai, 'darasal mahilaayein or purushon donon ke andar hi pitrusattatmak soch rachi basii hui he
 Women in the middle class quietly tolerate all atrocities while tribal women are more free
 purush din bhar kaam karke thakne or apni frustation nikaalane kii baat karte hai jabaki kai reports se pataa chalata he ki mahilaayein purushon se zyada ghante kaam karti hai
 She says that it is the wife who retains the importance of her husbands
 'pitrusatta agar galat he to iskaa ulta kya he? matrusatta? lekin kamala bhasin kahati hai ki pitrusatta kaa ulta matrusatta ho hi nahin saktaa he kyonki alag pitrusatta agar galat he to matrusatta bhi galat he
 Instead, the answer should be equal
 jab tak gharon main barabari nahin hogi tab tak sachhee mohabbat nahin ho sakati he
 For this it is necessary that the husband deities are sent out and the spouse is brought in
 agar aap donon jeevanasathinuma jivan bitaate aapke bachche dekhenge to aapke bachche bhi insaan banenge or aapaki betiyaan bhi daasi nahin banengi

 Modi alleged that while contesting the election, Tej Pratap has not given the correct information to the Commission in the affidavit
 susheel modi ne aaj ke samvaadadaata sammelan main up-mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ko ek baar phir gheraa
 Modi raised a number of questions giving details of new assets to Tejashwi Yadav's argument that the railway which the CBI has registered a land case for making goods in exchange for the property against him, at that time did not even have his mustache
 sabase pehle modi ne saafe kiya ki haal main sibiai ne jo unke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he wo is aadhaar par ki tejasvi dilite marketing main nideshak bane or maatra 65 lakh main 94 karod kii sampati ke maalik bane or us samay unki umr 24 saal thi
 Modi alleged that two properties in the name of Tejashwi Yadav were registered when he was just three years old
 modi ke anusaar tejasvi yadav ke naam gopalganj, patna se dilli tak 26 sampati hai jisame 13 sampatti ke maalik wo naaballig umr main bane
 According to Modi, when he was a minor, he never objected to why these assets were being given in his name, then why he is giving this argument when a case is filed
 haalanki susheel modi ke taaja bayaan or aarope par tejasvi yadav yaa unke pita lalu yadav ne koi pratikriya nahin di he, lekin party ke rashtriya pravaktaa ne kaha ki modi ke bayaan se hame is baat kii ek baar phir ashanka ho rahi hai ki mahagathbandhan ko todane ke liye kuch or nae maamle kendriya agenciyaan darj karne vaali he
 But the question is why RJD or Tejashwi Yadav do not give factual answers to the allegations against them
 khud mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne pichley mangalvaar ko apane party ke netaaon ke saamne ye bayaan diya tha ki jinke upar aarope lage unhen pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par jawaab dena chahie
 On this RJD President Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav themselves had said that all the allegations against them are politically motivated, but Janata Dal United did not appear satisfied with this
 is bich rashtriya janata dal ne nitish kumaar ke congress party alaakaman ko madhyasthata ke aagrah par filhal koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa hai
 And RJD leaders say that the Congress Party should first resign Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and then demand the resignation of Tejashwi Yadav
 is par congress ke netaa chuppi saadhe hue hai lekin janata dal united ke netaa kehete hai ki aise tarkon ke aadhaar par charge shit hone par bengal ke trinmul sarkaar ke madan mitra kaa udhaaharan de sakate hai jo jail jane ke baad bhi mantri bane rahe
 The leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal are confident that Nitish will continue to hold the post of minister on certain conditions until the charge sheet is run to run the grand alliance
 lekin rajya main nitish-lalu gatirodh ke kaaran uskaa asar vikaas kaaryon par saafe dekha ja saktaa he

 argedy ke vidhayak surendra yadav, ramanuj or argedy kota se mantri chandrashekhar ne tejasvi ke samarthan main aawaaj uthaai
 RJD MLA Surendra Yadav said that the way Akhilesh Yadav is running the government in Uttar Pradesh in the same way, Tejashwi Yadav can also run the government in Bihar
 surendra yadav ne kaha ki vakt aa chukaa he ki tejasvi ko ab mukhyamantri banaaya jaae
 But the one who acted as ghee in the fire was the statement of rjdsuprimo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 hajipur main lalu yadav ne patrakaron ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki akhilesh yadav or tejasvi yadav bhi bhavishya ke mukhyamantri hai kyonki vah khud or samaajawaadee party ke mulaayam singh yadav ab buudhe ho chuke hai
 However, Lalu made it clear at the moment that there is no vacancy for the Chief Minister's chair in Bihar at this time, as Nitish Kumar is the Chief Minister and is running the government
 shaam hone tak janata dal united kii taraf se bhi un argedy vidhayakon ko jawaab diya gaya, jo tejasvi ke mukhyamantri banane kii baat uthaa rahe hai
 JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that before the Bihar elections, Laloo Prasad Yadav had considered Nitish Kumar the leader of the grand alliance, so there is no vacancy for the Chief Minister in Bihar
 haalanki tejasvi par chutki lete hue niraj ne kaha ki tejasvi main jarur kuch gun hoga jisaki vajah se kai saal se vidhayak rahe surendra yadav ne bhi unhen apana netaa maan liya he

 When the Mumbai wicket started to fall with Rohit, within 50 runs, five of his important batsmen had returned to the pavilion, of which four batsmen could not even touch the tens

 Seeing the defeat standing in front, two bowlers at the crease Harbhajan Suchit started playing fast shots

 Harbhajan and Suchit conceded 88 runs, batting extremely aggressively in the five overs between the 15th over and the 19th over

 Mumbai however suffered the brunt of the collapse of the opening order and despite adding 99 runs in the last six overs, they were 18 runs behind the target

 While Sandeep, who conceded just 15 runs in four overs, got only one wicket, Johnson, Patel and Anurit Singh got two wickets each

 Captain George Belle smashed an unbeaten 61 from 32 balls with the help of four fours and three sixes

 However, for the fourth wicket however, David Miller (24) and Belle played a big role in taking the team to a respectable score by sharing 46 runs in 31 balls

 srilanka ke raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena ne desh main raajnneetik sankat khatm karne ke liye sarvadaleey baithak bulaai he
 The meeting has been called on Sunday evening at the President's Secretariat in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka
 srilankai raashtrapati ke karyaalay kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki aaj ravivaar shaam ko raashtrapati sirisena sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke pratinidhiyon kii baithak kii adhyakshata karenge
 The President has convened the meeting to end the current political deadlock and prevent Parliament proceedings from being disrupted
 yah jaankaree ek srilankai media ko di
 Let me tell you that recently Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisane Ranil Wickremesinghe was sacked from the post of Prime Minister and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister
 iske baad jab raashtrapati sirisena ko laga ki sansad main rajpakshe apana bahumat sabit nahin kar paaenge, to unhone sansad ko bhang kar diya
 Subsequently, the President's decision was challenged in the Supreme Court by Professor Ratnajivan Hule, member of several political parties and Election Commission
 is maamle main sunwaayee karte hue srilankai supreme court ne sansad bhang karne ke raashtrapati sirisena ke faisle ko palat diya tha
 Thereafter, the Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament, Karu Jayasuriya called a meeting of the House on 14 November and a motion of no-confidence against Mahinda Rajapaksa was passed
 225 sadasyeey sansad main mahinda rajpakshe ke khilaaf bahumat se avishvaas prastaav paas hone se unke samarthak bhadak gaye or hangaamaa karne lage
 In view of the opposition of Mahinda Rajapaksa's mps, the proceedings of Parliament had to be postponed till 16 November
 iske baad 16 november ko sansad kii baithak phir se bulaai gai
 In this meeting too, pro-mahinda mps created a ruckus and chili and books were thrown at police personnel
 baari hangaame ke bich adhyaksh karu jayasoorya ne somvaar tak ke liye baithak sthagit kar di
 President Sirisena has called an all-party meeting ahead of the parliament meeting on Monday
 is baithak kaa makasad srilanka main paidaa hue siyaasi sankat ko khatm karnaa he
 However, only after the meeting today, it will be clear whether the ongoing political deadlock in the country will end or not
 bhopal kaa loksabhaa chunaav aakhri baar 1991 main ek khaas vajah se surkhiyon main tha
 That was the main reason that Congress fielded former Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi aka Tiger Pataudi
 unhen tab bhaajapa ke es
 C
 verma ke haathon karaari shikast mili thi
 For Pataudi, the defeat was even more bitter as he suffered a defeat in Bhopal where he was once ruled by his younger people
 bhopal main bhaajapa kaa janaadhar kitna majboot he, ise isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki pichley 30 varshon main party ne lagaataar aath baar is seat par kabja jamaaya he, haalanki uske ummidavaar lagaataar badalte rahe hai
 Now come to 2019
 is baar bhi bhopal kii siyaasi ladaai rashtriya surkhiyaan bator rahi he
 The reason for this is the candidates of both the rival parties from this seat
 congress ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke khilaaf bhaajapa ne maalegaanv dhamaakon kii aaropee pragna singh thakur ko maidan main utaara he
 Obviously, the competition is strong and due to this, everyone's eyes will be set on Bhopal
 ek taraf satta kaa lanbaa anubhav rakhane vaale purv mukhyamantri hai, lekin lambey samay se apane upar ho rahe lagaataar rajnatik hamalon ke kaaran unki rajnatik jameen kuch khiski he
 The BJP leaders of the state have already promoted him as a divisive and anti-development campaigner of Madhya Pradesh
 rahi-sahi kasar bhaajapa kii trol fouj ne soshal media par unki chhavi hinduon ke sabase bade shatru congressi netaa ke taur par banaakar puri kar di he
 Digvijay Singh has tried to change his anti-hindu image through his 3,300-km Narmada Parikrama Yatra, as well as his political rejuvenation after the Congress returned to power in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years
 congress ko sattashin karne main ek pramukh ranneetikaar ke rup main unki bhi bhoomika thi
 Party insiders say that Digvijay did not want to contest from Bhopal but his friend and Chief Minister Kamal Nath forced him to contest from Bhopal itself
 baharhaal, ve joardaar ladaai se kabhi peeche nahin hate hai isliye raji ho gaye
 On the other side is Pragya Singh Thakur
 bhind main janmi is sadhvi kaa naam 2008 ke maalegaanv dhamaake main aaropee ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Six people were killed in the blast
 pragna, dakshinpanthi dal ke liye har lihaaj se mufeed hai
 She was a member of Durga Vahini and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in her early days and recently claimed that she had climbed over the dome to demolish the Babri Masjid
 pragna ko april, 2017 main jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya tha lekin gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyaan rokthaam adhinium (yuapie) ke tahat ve ab bhi ek abhiyukt hai kyonki rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ke unhen bari karne ke anurodh ke baavjood adaalat ne unhen aropamukt nahin kiya he
 Bhopal is considered a safe seat for the BJP and the party has no shortage of candidates, yet why did the party field Pragya Thakur from Bhopal? Party insiders say that from the day the Congress announced Digvijay Singh's candidature, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is clearly playing a role in the selection of candidates this time, and party president Amit Shah , Both were making up their mind to field Pragya Thakur against Digvijay this time
 netritv ke ek varg kaa maananaa tha ki congress ke purv mukhyamantri ke khilaaf pragna thakur ko utaarne ke peeche ek sandesh yah bhi dena he ki congress ne is seat se ek ‘hindu virdohi’ netaa ko utaara isliye bhaajapa ne pratikriyaswaroop ek kattar hinduvadi chehre ko mauka diya he
 This approach was intensely discussed within the BJP as many leaders were unwilling to do so for several reasons
 saath hi, bhaajapa netaaon ke ek varg ko laga ki beshak bhopal main bhaajapa majboot rahi he, phir bhi digvijay singh kii ummidavaari ko halke main nahin liya janaa chahie
 Finally, after nearly a month of deliberations and the refusal of top BJP leaders like Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Uma Bharti to contest from Bhopal, the party announced Pragya Thakur's candidature
 pragna thakur ko maidan main utaarne ko lekar bhaajapa kii chintaaen kya hai? bhaajapa ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki pragna thakur ko maidan main utaarne se party ke shahari vot ke ek hisse ke khisak jane kaa jokhim khadaa ho gaya he
 Says a BJP MLA, "people who vote for BJP in the name of development have raised questions about the choice of BJP candidate
 ve log congress ko bhi vot nahin de sakate
 In such a situation, they will either not go to vote or choose NOTA
 ’’ pragna thakur ke paas sanghathanaatmak anubhav kaa bhi abhaav he, shahar ke bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke saath unka sampark bhi bahut kam rahaa he or apane paksh main matadaataaon ko lamaband karne ke liye ve aresas par bahut adhik nirbhar hai
 Within a week of announcing his candidature, Pragya Thakur made an objectionable statement about Ashok Chakra awardee IPS officer late Hemant Karkare for polarizing voters
 unhone kaha ki unke shaap ke kaaran karkare ne ek aatanki ke haathon jaan ganvaai
 His statement created an uproar and the party which used the agenda of nationalism vigorously came on the backfoot
 lekin pragna thakur itane par nahin sanbhaleen
 She claimed the day after the statement that she was also involved in the Babri Masjid demolition
 bhaajapa lipapoti karne main jute gai or ab ek anbhavi pravaktaa kii du tii puri tarah unke saath lagaai gai he
 On 21 April, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan also held a lengthy conversation with him, explaining to him the intricacies associated with contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 ek hafte ke baad bhi, team pragna thakur ke paas bataane ke liye bhopal ke vikaas kaa apana koi agenda yaa dastavej nahin hai
 Obviously, this is not in his top priority
 haalanki party netritv kaa ek varg aisa he jo maanata he ki pragna thakur nirvachan kshetra ke gramin ilaakon main hindu voton kaa bhaajapa ke paksh main dhruvikaran karaayengi
 Originally, people for whom religion is the biggest factor while casting votes, there is a greater enthusiasm among the voters of both urban and rural areas than the candidature of Pragya Thakur
 bhopal loksabhaa ke antargat sihor, barasiyaa or hujur vidhansabha kshetron kaa gramin vot, bhopal ke kul 21 lakh voton kaa lagbhag 30 pratishat he
 He told party workers in Bhopal on Saturday, "modi ji has given this message that there is a need to give respect to saffron
" yah keval chunaav nahin balki ek dharmayuddh he
 Pragya Thakur filed his nomination from Bhopal on 23 April and ten minutes after that, the current MP Alok Sanjar filed his nomination as the party's dummy candidate
 ise party kaa byaap plan bataaya ja rahaa he
 Reason: The Election Commission has given two notices to Pragya Thakur and an FIR has been lodged against him for violation of Election Code of Conduct
 isaki vajah se unki ummidavaari andeh ke daayre main aa gai he
 On the other hand, the NIA court rejected the plea to stop Pragya Thakur from contesting elections, largely because Pragya Thakur's strategy seems to polarize Hindu votes to counter the polarization of Muslim votes
 bhaajapa ko ummid thi ki congress ummidavaar ke rup main digvijay singh ke aane se yah hoga
 Given that his candidate has no roadmap for development, BJP leaders are unable to position themselves to seek votes in the name of development
 yahi bhaajapa ke liye vidambnaa ban rahaa he
 a BJP candidate with a public life experience and a less radical background would have been able to use both the bjp's weapons against Digvijay Singh
 pehle to bhaajapa ne 15 varshon main digvijay singh kii jo vikaas virdohi chhavi banaai he uskaa, saath hi saath vah digvijay kii hindu virdohi or anargal pralaap karne vaale vyakti ke rup main bani tazatreen chhavi kaa bharpoor laabh uthaa saktaa tha
 Both these things would have been enough to tilt the battlefield towards BJP
 2003 main digvijay singh ke khilaaf hamale kii aguai karte hue uma bharti ne unhen bijli, sadak or pani jaise vikaas ke buniyadi muddon ko sulajhane main naakaam qaraar diya tha
 People got this thing and BJP got an unprecedented mandate but ironically, Congress is now talking about development while BJP speaks the language of religion
 in badale hue halaat main digvijay singh kii ranneeti kya he?purv mukhyamantri kareeb 19 saal ke lambey antaraal ke baad chunavi akhaade main laute hai
 First of all, they are not reacting to any of the issues raised by Pragya Thakur and are silent contrary to their nature
 ve vipakshiyon ke kisi bhi chakravyuuh main ghirna nahin chaahate isliye unhone pragna thakur ke karkare or babari masjid par die bayanon par tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 In his early days of the election campaign, he apologized to the staff, which has been a major vote bank of the city
 unhone 21 april ko bhopal ke liye ek fansy vijan document jari kiya, ek power point prajentation saamne rakhaa jisamen shahar kii sthaneey samasyaon par baat kii gai he
 In this way, they are trying to show that as far as the development agenda is concerned, they are miles ahead of the BJP
 team digvijay singh vibhinn saamaajik or aarthik samoohon, audyogic sanghathanon, chaatro or samudaayon ke saath parade ke peeche kaam kar rahi he, jisamen digvijay singh khud kam se kam teen darjan aise samoohon se mil chuke hai
 Aruneshwar Singhdev, who was part of his campaign team, stresses Digvijay Singh's personal association with voters, saying, "there is no person in politics who has helped so many people alone
" ’’aise matadaata jo chaahate hai ki unka netritv koi hindu netaa hi kare, aise logon ko rijhaane ke liye bhi digvijay ke paas paryaapt dharmik judaav uplabdh hai
 Most visits to Digvijay begin with temple visits and he visited more than a dozen temples on the occasion of the Hanuman birth anniversary on April 19, fostering cows in a gaushala and went to the gosva
 haalanki media ke saamne ve kehete hai, ‘‘meraa hindu dharm meri aasthaa he
 i have never preached my religious work, whether it is Narmada Parikrama, Govardhan Parikrama or Pandharpur Yatra
 sangh kaa hindutv logon main ekta nahin laata, balki baantta he
 i will never let my religion be lost for political gains
 ’’unke puraane saathiyon kaa network sakriy ho gaya he or digvijay singh ke skool indore ke daily college kii ek team bhi chunaav ke liye bhopal main deraa daale hue he
 About 300 of his fellow travelers in Narmada Parikrama are also campaigning for him from house to house
 bhopal loksabhaa kshetra main aath vidhansabha kshetra hai, jinamein se bhopal dakshin-pashchim, bhopal madhya or bhopal uttar par philhal congress kaa kabja he or barasiyaa, sihor, hujur, narela or govindpura bhaajapa ke paas hai
 Digvijay Singh's personal relationship with the three BJP mlas Krishna Gaur, Vishwas Sarang and Sudesh Rai is very cordial and there is a possibility that he will benefit from his personal ties
 iske alaava, bhopal se pragna thakur ko maidan main utaarne kaa faisla karne se pehle inamen se kisi se bhi paraamarsh yaa baatcheet nahin kii gai thi
 Perhaps this is the reason why these BJP mlas do not seem very excited about Pragya Thakur
 bhopal main lagbhag 4
 There are 5 lakh Muslim voters and there is no need to spend a lot of mind to assess who will get their vote
 iske alaava, lagbhag 1
 There are 75 lakh scheduled caste votes
 congress ko ummid he ki iskaa bada hissaa uski jholii main giregaa
 The election of Bhopal is a matter of discussion in many ways
 bhaajapa ke liye is seat kaa nateeja uske apane mul agenda ko sthapit karegaa or virodhiyon ke liye vichaarmanthan kaa avasar degaa ki kya desh kaa ab dakshinpanth kii ore ek sthaayee jhukaav ho gaya he
 For the people of Bhopal, defeat and victory in this election means so much: will the shared culture of the old Bhopal win or the new Bhopal in which the division on the basis of community is clearly visible? Three of the eight assembly seats in the Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency, Congress and five BJP Are near inamen se teen bhaajapa vidhayakon ke saath digvijay singh ke vyaktigat sambandh hai, jisakalabh milanaa tay he

 At some point, he may be angry that he will boycott the national executive of his own party and the party president will say that he must have done something
 baad main mukhyamantri unke ghar jaakar unki maan-manouvval karenge
 But despite all these grievances, neither Azam Khan leaves the party nor does the party leave him
 ajam khud kehete hai, ''meraa or netaji kaa rishta netagiri or siyaasi majaburiyon se kahin gaharaa he
 "azam was not in the party in the last Lok Sabha election and sp's seats were reduced to half
 khud ajam kaa kad bhi rampur tak simat kar rah gaya
 But when the two came together, the SP got the mandate in 2012 for which Mulayam Singh had longed for his life
 2009 ke ant main jab ajam ne sapa main vaapasi kii to mulaayam singh se mukhaatib hokar ajam ne sher padhaa, phir khushi se khushi kii taraf nahin dekha / tumhaare baad kisi kii taraf nahin dekha
 But this relationship is not with Akhilesh
 jaankaron kii maane to ajam is baat se khafa rahete hai ki akhilesh unka sammaan to bahut karte hai, lekin sarkaar main unki siforeeshon par amal bahut susti se hota he
 SP has also known this, so do not make headlines any more, hence Mulayam Singh is dealing with his friend instead of Akhilesh
 bharat main kendriya vidyalayon main teesri bhashaa ke rup main sanskrit ke vikalp ke taur par german bhashaa ko hataane kaa mudda germany kii chancelar angela mercel ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se baatcheet main uthaaya
 Modi assured them to consider it within the limits of the Indian system
 ji-20 shikhar sammelan se itar mulaakaat ke dauraan mercel ne modi ke saath is mudde ko uthaaya or unhen germany aane kaa nyotaa bhi diya
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said, Merkel raised the issue of teaching German language as an alternative to Sanskrit in Indian schools
 unhone pradhanmantri se is par vichaar karne tathaa yah dekhne kaa anurodh kiya ki aage kya sarvshereshth rasta ho saktaa he
 According to the spokesperson, the Prime Minister assured him that he himself supports children in India learning other languages
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya pranali ke daayre main is par kya sarvshereshth ho saktaa he, ham is par kaam karenge
 German Ambassador to India Michael Steiner has also raised the issue with the Government of India and hoped for a viable solution
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne sanskrit ke vikalp ke rup main german bhashaa ko hataane kaa faisla kiya, jiske baad kareeb 500 kendriya vidyalayon main kaksha chhathi se aathvin ke kareeb 70,000 bacchon se german kii jagah sanskrit bhashaa padhane ko kaha ja saktaa he
 In 2011, an mou was signed between the Kendriya Vidyalayas and the Goethe institute-max Müller building, making German the third language
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne sarkaar ke kadam kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki maujuuda vyavastha teen-bhashaa ke formule kaa ulanghan he
 However, he said that the German language will continue to be studied as an 'additional subject of interest'
 teen-bhashaa ke formule main skulon main hindi, angreji or ek aadhunik bhartiya bhashaa padhai jaati he
 Sanskrit language teachers had moved the Delhi High Court alleging that the Kendriya Vidyalayas have adopted German as a third language instead of Sanskrit against the education policy

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has decided to launch a campaign against casteism, untouchability in Hindu society
 sanghaki nai muhim sunne main beshak acchhee he, par hakeekat main kaise tabdeel ho paaegi, ye bada sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 Challenges before the Sangh Campaign: 1
 sadiyon se hindu samaaj jaateey vyavastha main jakadaaa hua he
 People have the freedom to change their religion, but if one wants to choose his caste, it is impossible
 agar koi rajput yaa baniyaa he or brahman bananaa chaahe to ye sambhav nahin he
 To be of any caste, it is necessary to be born in that caste
 ye vyavastha khatm karne ke liye sangh kya thos kadam uthayega or uski baat koun sunegaa ye sawaal uthanaa lajimi he?2
 It has been told that the intention of the Sangh is to eliminate discrimination on the basis of caste and to unite all those who believe in Hinduism
 iske saath hi, sangh kii yojana un logon ko bhi phir se hindu dharm ke daayre main laane kii he, jinhone koi or dharm sweekaar kar liya he
 So in which caste someone will be placed in this alleged homecoming situation, it is not clear which is a big challenge for the Sangh
 3
 When there is politics on the basis of caste, tickets are distributed in elections, then how can we expect the caste system to end
 chunaavon ke dauraan elahabaad hoicourt ne upi main raajnneetik partiyon ke jatigat sammelnon par roak laga di thi
 Then it happened so much that programs in the name of castes stopped in public
 sawaal ye he ki isse nibatane ke liye sangh kya upaay karegaa or wo kitna kargar hoga?4
 Some people believe that the caste-system will end only when relations are formed between different castes
 unke bich samanta or sammaan kaa bhav paidaa ho paaegaa
 Some people considered the Mandal Commission recommendations as a milestone, but will anyone ever forget its side effects
 sangh is disha main kaise aage badhegaa tasviir abhi saaf nahin he
 5
 sangh ne sabhi hinduon ke liye 'ek kuan, ek mandir or ek shmashaan bhoomi' kii avadharana par aage badhane kaa faisla kiya he
 Three years have been fixed for this project
 agar teen saal main is disha main thodi bhi uplabdhi hasil hui to badi hogi
 The Sangh will have to be convinced of this which is not easy in any way
 raajnneeti ke liye dharmik aadhaar par dhruvikaran bhale hi sambhav ho, par hindu samaaj ko sangathit karnaa hi sangh ke liye sabase chunauti bharaa kaam rahaa he
 Hindu society is so scattered on the basis of caste that it seems impossible to unite it
 is pahal ke saath sangh kaa der se aana ahm nahin rah jayega, basharte wo durust hokar aae

 The water shortage in Chennai was such that the hotel and restaurant had to be closed
 companiyon ko karmchaariyon ko apane ghar se hi kaam karne ko kahana padaa
 There were reports that along with banning the use of soap and shampoo to save water in the city, daily bathing was banned

 The condition of rivers and reservoirs deteriorated due to random use

 The 8 billion population must be facing a massive water crisis
 chennai, bengalooru or kolkata jaise shaharon main jalstrot lagaataar suukh rahe hai or sthiti bhayaavah hoti ja rahi he
 According to the World Bank, a state of water crisis occurs when the annual water supply falls below 1700 cubic meters per person
 aaie, ek najar daalate hai duniya ke un 10 shaharon ke bare main jo pani kii samasya se lagaataar jujh rahe hai or un shaharon kii lifestil kisi ho gai he
 Cape Town, South Africa
 The African city of Cape Town was very much discussed in the last 2 years (2017-18) due to water shortage

 Reduced to 5% and there was a lot of water shortage
 is kaaran shahar kii 40 lakh kii aabaadi ko khaasaa dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In January last year, the administration announced that the city had reached the brink of drought
 prashasan ko barish ke pani or anya tarah se uplabdh ho rahe pani ke sangrakshan kaa prayaas karnaa padaa
 It has not been successful so far, but only about 50 percent water is available in the dam, the drought situation is still there

 Tokyo, Japan Japan's capital Tokyo is also among the major cities facing water crisis

 But due to indiscriminate harvesting of Amazon forests and waste of 31% water, the problem increased and now there is a situation of water crisis here

 The city had to face a water crisis due to the depletion of the forest in a large part of the city
 jangal kaate jane ke kaaran jalastr girtaa chalaa gaya or vahaan sookhe kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 London, England The capital of England, London, known as the city of rain, is also facing a huge water crisis today
 landan main salanaa 600 millimetre tak barish hoti he jo ki paris or neuyork se kam he
 80% of the city's water needs come from rivers
 climet change hone ke kaaran saikadon pipe fat gaye jisase infrastakchar kamjor pad gaya
 Due to the rapid increase in the population of the city, the demand for water here increased and the water level kept falling
 sthaneey adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki shahar main aabaadi kaaphi bad gai he or 2025 tak yahaan par pani kaa sankat bad jayega
 Also, the situation will be explosive in the next 2 decades (by 2040)
 bengalooru, bharatbharat main sirf chennai hi balki kai or shahar hai jahaan par jal sankat vikaraal rup main jald hi saamne aane vaala he
