 repo rate badhane se aapke liye bainkon se karj lenaa mahangaa ho jayega or aapaki iemai bhi bad jaaegi
 To understand the effect on your pocket when the repo rate increases, first of all you have to know what the repo rate is
 repo rate kya he?repo rate vah dar hoti he, jis par bank arabiai se lone uthaate hai
 In fact, whenever banks are short of funds, they take money from the central bank to make up for it
 arabiai kii taraf se diya jane vaala yah lone ek phixd rate par miltaa he
 This rate is called repo rate
 ise bhartiya rigerv bank hi tay karata he
 Why does the RBI raise the repo rate? The Reserve Bank of India decides to cut or increase the repo rate based on the likely situation of the economy in the current and future
 kendriya bank repo rate main badhotaree zyaadaatar samay par tab karata he, jab desh main mahangaai kaa dabaav bana rahata he
 In such a situation, repo rate becomes an important means to bring it under control
 arabiai kii taraf se repo rate main badhotaree kiye jane se mahangaai ko kaabo rakhane main madad milti he
 Whenever RBI increases the repo rate, banks take less loan than that
 aisa hone kii vajah se chalan main mani supplai kam hoti he
 This helps in controlling inflation
 aap par hota he ye asarrepo rate badhane kaa matlab he ki bank arabiai se jo fund lenge, unhen vah mahangi daron par milegaa
 This increases the pressure on banks
 apane boj ko kam karne ke liye bank ise graahakon tak pahunchaate hai
 This burden is shared with you in the form of expensive debt and increased EMI
 isi vajah se jab bhi repo rate badhata he, to aapke liye karj lenaa mahangaa ho jaataa he
 If less
 
 
 agar repo rate kam hota he, to bainkon ke liye arabiai se fund uthaanaa sasta padataa he
 This motivates banks to give loans to their customers cheaply
 repo rate ghataane ke baad ve byaaj daron main katautee karte hai
 Now it has to be seen whether the Reserve Bank of India gives you a gift of cheap loan or it will be expensive for you to take a loan
 sambhaavna ye bhi jataai ja rahi he ki repo rate main pichhali teen baar kii tarah hi is baar bhi koi badlaav nahin kiya jayega
 Asaram, caught in a sexual harassment case of a girl, is going to get worse
 ab un kodewards kaa khulaasa ho gaya he, jise asaram logon ke saamne bolte the, lekin koi bahari shaks samaj nahin paata tha
 Take a look at Asaram's codewords and its meaning
 
 
 1
 Dial 400: Police investigation has revealed that '400 impose' meant talking to Asaram on mobile
 asaram ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve mobile nahin rakhte hai, lekin hakeekat yah he ki ve mobile rakhte hai
 Actually, the last 3 digits of Asaram's mobile number is '400'
 yah mobile asaram kaa rasoiyaa rakhata tha
 Whenever the cook changed, he was handed '400' to the new cooks
 rasoie ko phone uthaane kii ijaajat thi, na ki baat karne kii
 No one could put this phone to his ear except Asaram
 rasoie kii duty thi ki phone risive kar asaram ke kaan par laga de
 Whenever Shiva, Shilpi or Sharatchand had to talk to Asaram on the phone, he used to say that 400 is fixed or 400 has been talked and instructions have been given to complete the work
 police kii jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki maamle ke sabhi aaropee shilpi, shiva or sharathchandra 400 par hi baat kar rahe hai
 That is, every new information is being given to Asaram
 6 agast ko shilpi ne peedita ko samajhaayaa tha ki us par bhoot-pret kaa saaya he or asaram use thik kar sakate hai
 From the same day the bell of 400 began to be hoisted
 vaardaat ke aakhri din yani 16 agast tak 400 par maamle ke duusare aaropee kirdaar shilpi, shiva or sharathchandra aapas main baatcheet karte rahe
 In the investigation, the police has presented 400 call details of May, June and July as evidence, stating that the three accused were never negotiated on this number
 lekin sajeesh rachane ke din se lekar peedita ke madi ashram se jane tak 400 par teenon shilpi, shiva or sharatchand ke phone aate the
 2
 samarpan:jab bhi koi ladki asaram ko acchhee lagati thi, sevakon ko samarpan karaane kaa aadesh diya jaataa tha
 Once the girl was ready to surrender, she was sent to meet Bapu in private
 vahaan ladki ke asaram ke samarpit hone ke baad use ahmedabad ashram main bulaayaa jaataa tha
 The girl also said in a statement to the police and magistrate that soon after she became ill, the director of Chhindwara Ashram, Sharatchand called her to her office and explained that she should become a sadhvi and devote herself to Baba
 iske baad raatbhar use sone nahin diya gaya
 The ritual was performed by sitting with a girl
 yahi nahin, peedita ne bataaya ki asaram ne use kutiyaa main andhere main bandakar chhedhkhani karne se pehle bhi yahi kaha tha, 'tu sie banakar kya karegi, samarpan kar de
 Good at reading and writing
 acchhee vaktaa banegi, pravachan karnaa
 Asaram himself used to choose the girl who surrendered and thought that the matter would be made, then it was the responsibility of the craftsman to surrender
 peedita ke bayanon ke mutabik, usase pehali baar asaram may-june 2012 main haridwar ke ashram main mili the or tab unhone 'galat jagahon par' haath rakhe the
 The victim then did not protest considering that a father placed his hand on his daughter's body
 bas isi ishaare ko asaram ne sahmati samajhane kii bhul kar di or janvari 2013 main chhindwara pahunch gaye
 Talked to Sharat Chand there and sent Shilpi as warden of Chhindwara Ashram in March 2013, so that Shilpi could execute Asaram's intentions
 asaram kii daal bhale hi nahin gali, lekin peedita kaa parivaar jab kutiyaa se jane laga, to bhi asaram maane nahin or kaha ki peedita ko ahmedabad le aana
 After this, an Indore woman who accused Asaram's son Narayan Sami has also accused Asaram that when she met Asaram in Ajmer in 200, Sham called her alone and held her hand and said what would you do by getting married
 , Surrender
 3
 New Name: Asaram never used to call the girl who comes near him
 peedita ko bhi usne nayaa naam de rakhaa tha 'jetty'
 Asaram used to call the victim by this name
 iske pehle asaram ne sanchita gupta kaa naam bhi 'shilpi' rakhaa tha or ashramon main wo 'shilpi' ke naam se jaani jaati thi

 torch kii roshni:asaram dhyaan kii kutiyaa main akele hi rahaa karte hai
 They keep a flashlight with them
 dhyaan kii kutiyaa main asaram andhera karke rakhte hai
 If anyone wants to call, instead of giving a voice, they call only by flashlight
 is madi kutiyaa main bhi peedita ne kaha ki unhone pichley daravaaje se jaakar aage kaa darwaja band kar diya, phir kamare main andhera kar diya
 After this Asaram went inside and gestured with the light of the flashlight and called him inside

 ise lekar congress ne ek baar phir morcha kholaa he orkejarivalpar jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 According to Maken, Kejriwal's legislators now want to go even further and so if they do not remain dissatisfied, they made 21 of their mlas parliamentary secretaries, which is not right
 maakan ne kaha ki 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv chunaa janaa ek tarah kaa bhrashtachar or kanoon kaa ulanghan he
 To prevent mlas from going with Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made him parliamentary secretary, allowing him equal facilities as ministers
 yah gaiyrkanoonee he or sansadeey sachiv banane vaale vidhayakon kii sadsyta rad ho sakati he, isliye janhit yachika par faisla aane se pehle uparajyapal ko ise manjuuri nahin deni chahie
 According to the Congress, the first law was that parliamentary secretaries were made with the Chief Minister and not with the ministers

 This feeling has brought relief to the security agencies of the country
 vahiin desh ke dushmano ke liye ye musiibat banegaa
 Because these youth of Kashmir have come out of their homes in queues to die on the country
 pulavama hamale ke baad kashmir main ek raahat bhari tasviir saamne ai he
 In which thousands of Kashmiri youth are seen protecting themselves from wandering
 iske baad ab kashmiriyon ko hi tay karnaa he ki wo bhatakana chaahate hai yaa sanvarna
 They will die as Adil Ahmad Dar and become a cause of shame for the family or they will give them a chance to be proud by being martyred like Jambaz Nisar Ahmed
 haal hi main ek sena ke varisht adhikari dhillan ne apli karte hue kaha 'kashmir ke samaaj main maataaon kii ahm bhoomika hoti he
 i want to appeal to all the mothers of Kashmir to tell their children who have adopted terrorism to surrender and return to the mainstream
 'darasal, bharat kashmir ke har us noujvaan ko sanvarne kaa mauka dena chahta he, jo bhatak chuke hai
 Otherwise, history is witness that whoever raised a gun against the country was killed
 ab sena ke paas aise hajaaron naujavaanon ke naam kii list he, jo desh ke liye jeena chaahate hai
 Otherwise, the Indian Army also has a list of those who were living for the enemies and died a bad death
 unamem se koi nahin bachaa
 Then whether it is Burhan, Kamran or Ghazi
 isliye kisi burhan, gaji yaa kamran kii tarah bemaut marane or apane gharavaalon ko sharminda hone se bachaane ke liye in hazaron kashmiri naujavaanon ne watanparasti kaa rasta chunaa he
 Now they not only want to live for the country but are also ready to die
 bhartee kii qatari main khadey hokar ye kashmiri noujvaan elaan kar rahe hai ki kisi adil ahamed daar yaa sarhad paar baithe aatank ke aakaaon ko ab ye apni ghati ko ganda nahin karne denge
 Now these youth will not let the head of Kashmiriyat bow down
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki jis baraamula ko aatankiyon kaa garh mana jaataa he, vahaan itani badi taadaad main bhartiya sena main bhartee hone ke liye nikalakar kashmiri naujavaanon ne naa sirf misaal kaayam kii he
 Rather, a strong message has been sent to the enemies of the country
 pulavama hamale ke baad soshal media par kashmiriyon kii deshbhakti par hi sawaal uthne lage
 But the mob for recruitment in the army is telling that Hindustan still beats in the hearts of Kashmiris
 or agar aisa naa hota to bhartiya sena main 111 javaanon kii bhartee ke liye 3 hazaar se zyaada local kashmiri yuva nahin jutate

 SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav said that in UP, BJP will not find a place to set foot
 piem ko banaras chhodkar kahin or janaa hoga
 When the Samajwadi Party and our allies take to the streets, it will become difficult to work
 vahiin akhilesh ne bijepi kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki unke paas sibiai he to hamaare paas gathbandhan he
 BJP should keep in mind that CBI does not win elections
 basapa ke satish mishra ne kaha ki agar aarope adhikari par hai, to le aarope mantri par kaise ho sakate hai? sibiai kii dhamkee se sabit hota he ki sarkaar kaise sibiai ko dhwast kar rahi he
 There is neither law and order nor women is safe in UP
 hamirpur main jo hua he, uske liye mukhyamantri kaise jimmedaar he
 Apart from this, SP MP Dharmendra Yadav also took up the case of CBI action in UP in Lok Sabha today
 dharmendra yadav ne kaha ki 4 janvari ko basapa supremeo mayawati or sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke bich mulaakaat hui thi
 After that on January 5, raids were carried out by the CBI in UP and an FIR was lodged

 Congress has also announced to stand with Akhilesh on this issue
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne somvaar ko ek press conference karke kaha ki narendra modi ne kisaanon or mazdooron par dhyaan nahin diya or sibiai duusari sansthaaon ke jariye duusari partiyon par dabaav banavaane kaa kaam kiya
 On the go, the government is taking action against Akhilesh Yadav
 sarkaar bane hue itane saal ho gaye, tab se use yah kyon nahin dikhaa
 There is no alliance during the elections, so all this is happening
 lekin is desh main aisi taanaashaahee nahin chalegi

 Tejashwi Yadav has hit back on social media, unable to manage
 tejasvi ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki nitish kumaar aajkal khud se khafa chal rahe hai or unhen yah pataa nahin hota ki vah kab, kya or kyon bol rahe hai? tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar soshal media ko lekar kisi vajah se naaraaz hai, kyonki vah anya media plateform kii tarah use manage nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Tejashwi Yadav alleged that Nitish Kumar manages print and electronic media and makes him glorious
 tejasvi ne kaha ki vigyaapan chin lene kaa khauf dikhaakar nitish media channelon or akhabaaron ko blackmel karte hai or unase apane paksh kii khabaren likhavane kaa dabaav banaate hai
 The RJD leader said that if someone writes a news report against Nitish Kumar on an electronic channel or a newspaper, then through information and public relations officers, the journalist calls and corrects him
 tejasvi ne kaha ki aisa karne kii sahuuliyat nitish kumaar ko soshal media plateform par nahin mil paa rahi he, isi vajah se vah jhunjhalaae se rahete hai
 The conservative leader told Nitish, Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar is an orthodox leader of the older generation who does not understand the expectations and aspirations of today's youth
 isiilie technology kaa prayog kar rahe yuvaaon ko lekar vah sankeern bayaanbaji karte hai
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar is a leader who roams in helicopters and social media makes him meet the surface of reality and that is why he hates social media
 jadyu kaa javaabanitish par tejasvi ke hamale kaa jawaab dete hue jadyu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki loktantr ke chauthe khambe ne sabhi ko samaan avasar diya he
 But unfortunately, Tejashwi Yadav is far from the ground of reality despite being the leader of opposition
 sanjay singh ne tejasvi yadav ko salaah di thi agar unke andar itani hi asuraksha kii bhaavana he to unhen raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie

 ) bollywood star rithik roshan kaa kahana he ki unhone jivan main bahut saare utaar-chadhaavon kaa saamana kiya he
 Hrithik has also admitted to having suffered from depression
 lekin rithik ne saath hi kaha he ki depressant aisi cheez nahin jise kisi kharaab baat kii tarah apane saath jod kar dekha jaae
 Hrithik said that issues related to mental health should be discussed in general
 inhen aisa nahin mana janaa chahie ki ye laailaaj hai
 Hrithik Roshan was speaking at the launch of the 'everyday Heroes' campaign of m Power
 rithik ne kaha,'maine kai utaar chadhaav dekhe hai
 i have experienced depression, i have experienced doubt, like we all do
 ye bahut saamaanya baat he
 Whenever we speak on it, take it in a simple way
 'ritikne kaha ki maansik beemaari ko bhi sweekaar vaise hi ladanaa chahie jaise ki ham anya bimariyon par karte hai
 According to Hrithik, the ups and downs he saw helped his development as a person
 rithik ne kaha, 'maine nijee jindagi main kai muddon kaa saamana kiya
 It happens to all of us
 upar janaa jaruri he to neeche aana bhi utana hi ahm he
 Both of these are necessary to make your personality
 jab aap neeche jate hai to aapke vichaaron kii spashtataa jaruri hoti he
 Your brain dominates you
 anachaahe vichaar aap par chaane lagate hai
 At that time you need a second or third person who can tell you what is happening to you
 'rithik ne 2000 main bollywood main 'kaho naa pyaar he' se aagaaj kiya
 Hrithik told that he saw many of his friends who silently deal with depression and other mental issues
 rithik ke mutabik isi ne unhen mudde kii gaharaai tak jane ke liye prerit kiya
 Hrithik said, this is the thing that was on his mind for years
 rithik ke mutabik jab ham pet yaa kidney kii samasya se grast hote hai to ham ise saamaanya maanate hue iskaa ilaaj karaate hai
 Then there is a problem of the mind, whatever is a part, why are they so afraid
 aisa samajhate hai ki ye hamaari galati he or ise hamen duusare logon se chupaana chahie, jindagi main kabhi naa kabhi sabhi ko maansik muddon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 There is an ongoing deadlock between the BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra over government formation
 is bich shivasena ne aaj phir apane mukhpatr 'saamana' ke jariye bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa he or bijepi par vidhayakon ko kharidne ke liye paise baantne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Shiv Sena has written in the editorial of 'saamana', 'the state will have a government of Mahayuti, such a cry has been made by the leaders of BJP like Chandrakant Dada Patil etc
 unke munh main shakkar kyonki sudhir mungantiwar ne ‘khush' khabar milegi, aisa daawa kiya he
 Now the question is that when will that government come and how will it be, this grandfather etc
 did not tell
 bhartiya janata party jis ‘mahayuti' kii baat kar rahi he wo aakaar main badi ho phir bhi usamen shaamil kai dalon ke ek bhi vidhayak nahin hai
 Without this, the 'mahamandal' of the mlas met the Governor the day after yesterday and expressed concern about the formation of the government
 ye bina vidhayakon vaale mahamandal kal duusari sarkaar ke aane par pichhlaa sab kuch bhulaakar nai sarkaar main shaamil najar aaenge
 Many 'outgoing' ministers are worried
 unhen bhi apni sarkari gaadi, ghoda, bangala jane kii chintaa he
 His heartbeat has increased
 par rajya kii janata ek sur main maang kar rahi he ki kuch bhi ho maharashtra main shivasena kaa hi mukhyamantri hona chahie
 Whoever has the data, he should also form the government and also make the Chief Minister, this is also our opinion
 mukhpatr main likhaa he, ab maharashtra kii drushti se ek hi khushkhabari apekshit he or wo he ‘shivasena' kaa netaa mukhyamantri pad kaa shapath grahan karanevaala he
 a self-respecting government will come in the destiny of Maharashtra and if it is written on the forehead of the people, then no one has the power to erase that fate line
 bhartiya janata party charchaa kaa darwaja band karke nahin baithi he, aisa kaha ja rahaa he
 We have also opened the doors, windows and the winds are boisterous
 sirf itani satarkta rakhi he ki hawa ke saath keet-patange andar na aa jaaen
 We are worried about the state and farmers
 pichhali satta kaa upyog agali satta ke liye ‘theliyaan' baantne main ho rahaa he par kisaanon ke haath koi damadi bhi rakhane ko taiyaar nahin he isiilie kisaanon ko shivasena kii satta chahie
 We are only talking about this issue and if it is a matter of punches, we will also answer them
 maharashtra kii pratishtha dhoomil karke koi rajya nahin kar saktaa
 Shiv Sena is standing there with a sword

 Sheila Dixit was the Chief Minister of Delhi for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013
 haalanki, 2013 main aam aadmi party ke ufaan main shila dikshit kii sarkaar bah gai
 However, anti-incumbency is also believed to have dominated Sheila Dixit's defeat
 iske baad vah 2014 main kerala kii rajyapal bhi raheen
 Sheila Dixit was born on 31 March 1938 in Kapurthala, Punjab
 shila dikshit ne dilli vishvavidhyalay ke miranda house se itihaas main master degree hasil kii

 The CCTV camera tender case in Delhi is getting caught up in the case of disturbances
 is mudde par dilli congress lagaataar aakraamak bani hui he or pradesh party ke sheersh netaaon ne aap sarkaar ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki 24 ghante ke andar nijee company kaa naam saarvajanik kare
 Also, a CBI inquiry was also demanded
 pradesh congress ke teen varisht netaa arvinder singh lavali, doctor eke walia or harun yusuf ne guuruuvaar ko pisi kar aam aadmi party sarkaar ko sawaalon ke katghare main khadaa kiya
 Earlier, Delhi Congress President Ajay Makenne also made a press conference and accused the Aam Aadmi Party government
 nijee company kaa naam ujagar hodilli sarkarmen mantri rahe lavali ne kaha ki yadi aam aadmi party ne dilli mencisitivi cameralagavane ke liye saarvajanik company ke saath-saath jis nijee company ke saath qaraar kiya he, uskaa naam 24 ghante main ujagar kare nahin to dilli congress us company kaa naam saarvajanik karegi jiskaa phayda yah sarkaar uthaanaa chaah rahi thi
 Lovely said the GFR has been clearly violated in a CCTV camera tender
 jiefar kisi bhi mantri yaa sarkaar se upar hota he, jo bhi mantri or prashasnic adhikari desh main jail gaye un sabhi ne jiefar kaa hi ulanghan kiya tha
 Lovely demanded that the CCTV camera tender scam be investigated by the CBI
 dilli sarkaar ko sibiai kii ore se clin chit milti he to congress party unase maafee maangegi, yadi dilli sarkaar is maamle main doshi pai jaati he to unhen dilli kii janata ko gumraah karne ke liye maafee maangani hogi or tyaagptr dena hoga
 Dr AK Walia said that only the AAP government of Delhi works only for spying and does not do any work on the ground
 sisitivi camera lagane ke vakt aihtiyaat baratna jaruri he kyonki ye camere puri dilli main lagaae jane hai
 Senior Congress leader and former minister Harun Yusuf said that this is a big drawback in the case of CCTV cameras as the AMC was finalized even before cabinet approval
 nijee company ko phayda pahunchane ke liye yah sara drama kyon kiya gaya? There are many challenges in the Test series facing the Australian team that reached India
 australian team kii sabase badi chunauti hai bhartiya captain viraat kohli, jo test ho yaa vanade sabhi formet main lagaataar shandaar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Many former Australian cricketers have already warned the Australian team about Virat
 lekin aisa nahin he ki kangarooon ke saamne sirf viraat kohli hi hai, bharat ko haraane ke liye australia ko in chunautiyon se nipatna hoga:-aswin or jadeja kii jodibhartiya pichon par hameshaa se hi spinneron kaa bolbalaa bolta he, videshi timen har baar bhartiya spin ke aage ghutane tekti huin najar ain he
 The top two bowlers in the current Test rankings, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, will be a big threat to Australia
 2016 main aswin ne kul 72 wicket liye the or vah acchhee form main bhi chal rahe hai, to vahiin duusari ore jadeja bhi kangarooon kii naak main dam kar sakate hai
 In the last 13 Tests, the pair have taken 127 wickets out of a total of 260, including 5 wickets hall 10 times
 tej gendbaajon kii tikdibhartiya spin ke saath hi bhartiya tej gendbaajon tikdi bhi shandaar form main chal rahi he
 The trio of Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar will lead the Indian team in the first two Tests
 gharelu pichon par yah tikdi australia ke liye musiibat sabit kar sakati he
 High-speed filming: Indian team has been one of the best teams in the world for a long time
 vanade or tii-20 ke alaava test main bhi tej-tarraar filding se virodhiyon par dabaav banaaya ja saktaa he
 The Indian team has great players like captain Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Murali Vijay and Ravindra Jadeja
 australia jaisi majboot team ko takkar dene ke liye bharat kii yah taiyaari bharat ko aane vaali siries main kaaphi phayda pahunchaa sakati he
 Australia's batting army may be focused on stopping Virat Kohli, but he should not forget the other Indian batsmen
 bharat kii ore se cheteshwar pujaara, openar murali vijay or ajinkya rahane jaise ballebaaj bada sirdard ban sakate hai
 At the same time, Ravindra Jadeja, wicketkeeper Saha and Ravichandran Ashwin can suffocate the Kangaroos
 kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aane vaali bharat-australia siries kaaphi romaanchak hogi, to vahiin kangaaroon ko bharat ko haraane ke liye kaaphi mashkkat kerani pad sakati hai

 - Faded (alan Walker) seemapar aatankwaad par vaarta ke bharat ke prastaav ko nazarandaaj karte hue pakistan ne shuukravaar ko videsh sachiv es jaishankar ko ‘‘sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke prastaavon ke anusaar’’ kashmir mudde par charchaa ke liye is maheene ke ant tak islamabad aane kaa nyotaa diya
 Pakistan alleged "human rights violations in Kashmir" and said that they should be terminated immediately and sought permission to allow Pakistani doctors and paramedics personnel to visit Kashmir
 pakistan videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki uske videsh sachiv ejaj ahamed choudhary ne seemapar aatankwaad par vaarta ke liye jaishankar ke prastaav par jawaab diya he
 The answer was handed over by Chaudhary in Islamabad to Indian High Commissioner Gautam Bambwale
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki patr main bhartiya videsh sachiv ko ‘‘jammu kashmir masale par charchaa ke liye is maheene ke ant tak islamabad aane’’ kaa nyotaa diya gaya taaki rajya kii janata kii ‘aakankshaon or sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke prastaavon ke anusaar nishpaksh evam nyaaysangat samaadhaan nikaala jaae
 "pakistan has asked" doctors and paramedics personnel to provide medical facilities to the injured, including permission to travel to Jammu and Kashmir "
 isse pehle, pakistan ne somvaar ko bharat ko kashmir par vaarta ke liye nyauta diya tha or kaha tha ki is mudde ko suljhaana donon deshon ke liye ‘‘antarrashtriya baadhyataa’’ he
 However, India on Wednesday rejected Pakistan's proposal of Foreign Secretary level talks on Kashmir and said that the talks should be on "aspects related to cross-border terrorism" which is central to the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 jaishankar ne seemapar aatankwaad par charchaa ke liye islamabad jane kii ichha jataate hue kaha tha ki pakistan ko jammu kashmir kii sthiti ke kisi pahalu par baatcheet kaa koi adhikaar nahin he kyonki yah bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 India, while stating the conditions for talks yesterday, said that the talks should focus on ending terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir and abetting violence and terror in the Valley
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki jaishankar ne apane pakistani samakaksh ko bataaya he ki vah islamabad aane kaa nyotaa sweekaar karte hai lekin unhone spasht kiya ki baatcheet main sabase pehle unke dwaara jammu kashmir kii sthiti ko lekar bataae gaye pahaluon par dhyaan hona chahie

 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ke kashmir par madhyasthata ke mudde par die bayaan ko bharat sarkaar ne bhale hi khaarij kar diya ho, lekin yah pehali baar nahin he, jab trump kii aguwai main america ne kashmir par sakriyata dikhaai ho
 This is definitely the first time the US President has waged a shigufa for the alleged offer of mediation on Kashmir by naming the Prime Minister of India
 bharat is par agbabula he, lekin kootneeti kii nazaakat aisi he ki trump ko sidhe-sidhe jhootha qaraar dene se kataraa rahi he narendra modi sarkaar
 So is it because of Donald Trump's outrage and his immaturity
 
 
 ? ise gambhirtha se lene kii zarurat nahin, yah kahkar kya ise itani aasaani se darkinar kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 The If you look in the mirror of the past, then it is more than nonsense
 saal 2017 main america main satta sanbhaalane ke baad se trump kii tedi nazar kashmir par rahi he
 Then US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley surprised everyone by saying that the US would not wait for something to happen between India and Pakistan
 april, 2017 main niki heli ne trump prashasan kii taraf se kashmir par apane iraade ko kaaphi had tak saaf kar diya tha
 Nikki Haley had made clear her intention to play a role in reducing tensions between India and Pakistan
 yah america kii us niti main bahut bada badlaav tha, jiske tahat america hameshaa kashmir ko bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa dwipaksheeya vivaad maanata rahaa he
 Trump has been representing his limited diplomatic capability from time to time, but the statement that Kashmir now offers arbitration is not just an irresponsible statement
 america raashtrapati donald trump kii dilchaspee bharat or pakistan ke aapasi vivaad hal karne main pehle se he
 After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir in February this year, the Trump administration took credit for reducing tension
 pakistan ke kabze se bharat ke payalat abhinandan vardhaman kii sakushal rihaai ke liye bhi america ne dabaav banane kaa daawa kiya tha
 In addition, US efforts to pressure China into declaring Masood Azhar, the mastermind of terror sitting in Pakistan at the United Nations, cannot be ignored
 lambii jaddojahad ke baad china ne masood azhar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne main adnga daalane par kadam peeche khinche
 It is possible that Trump wants to try his hand at resolving the over 70-year-old Kashmir dispute, influenced by his exploits to establish peace in the Korean subcontinent
 lambey arse se lard rahe uttar korea or dakshin korea ko baatcheet kii mez par laana or parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii uttar korea kii gidad bhabhaki ke saaye main shanti kaayam karnaa ek uplabdhi he or is maamle main trump, america ke tamaam purv raashtrapatiyon ko pachhad chuke hai
 The changes in US relations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and not one, two-time meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un suggest that Trump did not fire raw bullets in the dispute resolution
 haalanki yah alag baat he ki iran ke saath samjhauta radd karnaa ho yaa britain samet anya europea deshon ke saath america rishto ke thande padane ke peeche bhi trump kii kootneeti hi zimmedaar he
 As far as Trump's claim of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's offer of arbitration over Kashmir, it needs to be seen in the context of thousands of statements made by Trump, which have been found to be baseless
 america itihaas main donald trump aise raashtrapati ke taur par bhi jane jaaenge, jinke kaarykaal main sabase zyaada aadharahin or bachakaane bayaan die gaye hai
 According to the American newspaper 'the Washington Post', as of June 10, 2019, President Donald Trump has given 10,796 false or misleading statements in his 869-day tenure
 trump ke bayaan isi ke chalate america prashasan ke liye ek boj ban chuke hai, jinaki pairvi or samarthan karnaa zyaadaatar americanyon ke liye na ugalate banataa he, na nigalate
 The issue of Kashmir is the Laxman Rekha of mutual relations between India and Pakistan, on which offering the arbitration is like crossing the Laxman Rekha
 lekin trump kaa mizaaj lakshmana rekhaon ko maanane kaa aadi nahin he, so, aise main unke satta main rahete is tarah kii gugali kaa saamana karne ke liye bharat ko bhavishya main bhi taiyaar rahanaa hoga

 There is anger among Dalits against the demolition of a temple of Sant Ravidas in South Delhi

 The Kejriwal government of Delhi decided on Thursday (august 22) that a grand temple would be built where the temple was demolished
 dilli vidhansabha ne iske liye prastaav bhi paarit kar diya he
 Where the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP are in front of this issue
 jahaan kejariwal sarkaar ne iske liye bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya to hi ambedkarnagar se hi aam aadmi party ke vidhayak ajay dutt ne apane tak kapade faad liya
 So right there BJP is accusing the man party

 Also, Manoj Tiwari gave a big statement

 Whether the BJP has to go to court or the government has to take a decision on this, Sant Ravidas Ji's temple will be built there itself
 'aage manoj tiwari ne kaha, 'jahaan mandir tha vahiin banegaa

 Naresh Kalpi, Principal Doctor of Ravi Das Temple in Govindpuri said, 'whatever happened is very wrong
 ye mandir kaaphi purana tha, jab ye mandir bana tha to us samay to didie bhi nahin tha, is jameen ko sikandar lodhi ne saunpa tha lekin ab didie apana adhikaar bataa rahi he
 Dalit society is not going to leave this issue
 'to vahiin ravi das mandir ke purv pradhan banarsi das ne kaha, 'iske liye centre sarkaar jimmedaar he
 In many parks, people have built mosques on the temple and government lands but there is no talk of demolishing them but our revered Sant Ravi Das Ji temple has been demolished, our opposition will continue
 'to vahiin dalit samaaj se doctor shiv ram ne kaha, 'jaise mandir todi gai he wo mandir vahiin bananaa chahie ye hamaare aasthaa kaa vishay he
 There was a lot of anger among the Dalit community, whether it was men or women
 'jiske baad ajtak kii team ne tughluqabad ke use jagah bhi gaye jahaan ravi das ji kaa mandir tha
 Where people from different areas of Delhi were coming to worship outside
 jis jagah par ye mandir tha usase ravi das maarg kaha jaataa he
 The way to the temple is covered with a wall and the police is guarded vigorously
 jab mandir ke bare main logon se poocha gaya to unhone bataaya, 'ye mandir zyada bada tha or nahin chota, ye kaaphi purana mandir tha
 There was a pond near the temple where people used to bathe
 saath hi ek aasthaa bhi judi hui he ki talab ke paas kii mitti ko log apane saath le jate the
 People believed that the person who has skin disease, if the soil near the pond is applied to the body, the skin disease is eradicated

 Taking suo motu cognizance, the Muslim Personal Law had instructed to examine the legal validity of the practice of terminating the relationship, saying divorce thrice
 jabaki empielbi ne kaha he ki yah court ke kshetradhikaar main nahin he
 The Law Board contends that the community law is based on the Koran, so it is not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review it
 empielbi ne kaha ki yah koi sansad se paas kiya hua kanoon nahin he

 i have always been anxious to know the state of writing
 rachana jis sthaan se udbhoot hui he, uske bare main ek baar main thik se jaan luun to likhi jane vaali us rachana ke prati meri samaj bad jaati he
 i believe that writers who write about India while living outside India somehow malign the society about which they wrote: Their choices meant that a million dollar advance for books based on this continent It is appropriate to take it, but for the sake of God, one must first see life at the mouth of that crowded and corrupt hell
 yah mere liye sharmasaar hone kaa vakt he
 i am writing this article on Mumbai — what this city is and what it can be — in the cool and lush green environment of a Boston suburb
 main yahaan ek maheene se hum, apane janm sthaan vaale shahar ko chode hue ek maheenaa guzar chukaa he, shaayad kabhi nahin lautoonga (kam-se-kam uske nivasee ke rup main to nahin hi), or mujhe fouran jo nae kaushal seekhney hai, unamem ek or bad gaya haih kisi manje hue enarai lekhak kii tarah apni yaadon ke aadhaar par kaise likhaa jaae
 Despite spending decades in Mumbai, memories of special things have just begun to blur: the waning feeling of the monsoon cold air, the sound of the loudspeaker of the neighboring mosque, the torture of being stuck in a traffic jam during a crowd
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan jab main apni umr ke tisare dashak ke shuru main pahunchaa to mere pita kaa dehanth ho gaya or main khud pita ban gaya, mumbai ke saath meraa romance khatm hone laga; uski hakikaton ko nazarandaaj karnaa mushkil hone laga, or phir mujhe ehsaas hua ki mujhe us shahar ke bhagya kii parvaah nahin he
 This was a confusing situation
 maine mumbai ke bare main kai varshon tak likhaa he
 But my separation from Mumbai was more than the end of romance; It was like breaking the relationship between birth and birth
 koi apni maa se jaldi alag nahin hota; jab is tarah kii naubat aati he to jivan main bahut khalipan aa jaataa he or use bharne main kaaphi vakt lag saktaa he
 i think five years ago Mumbai ended the feeling of hospitality when my wife Kavita and i decided to find a home to live independently for the first time after marriage
 pehali baar ghar talashne waalon kii tarah ham behatar ghar chaahate the or use hasil karne kii ummid kar rahe the, or hamaara bajet utana hi kam tha jitani zyada hamaari aakankshaayen thim
 But that city immediately overshadowed our expectations
 mumbai kaa real estate bazaar is mahanagar ke jivan kaa iklauta sabase zyada kunthit or dil todane vaala pahalu he
 No matter how much you want to increase your budget and how little you are willing to accept instead, the land mafia of Mumbai will move the land under your feet
 yah shahar ke chirparichit awasaiya bhedbhaav ke bare main koi shikaayat nahin he; un jagahon kii simaaen tay hai jahaan muslim sampatti kharid sakate hai yaa nahin, or agar main kabhi-kabhi us seemaa ke paar bhatak gaya to iske liye meri agyanta ko hi doshi tehraaya ja saktaa tha
 We continued our search in those areas — Colaba, Mazagaon, Byculla and Fort — which were considered strongholds of secularism, places where pig-eaters, idol-worshipers and goat-bitters were indifferent to each other
 Live together in a style of work
 ham ise mumbai kii khubi ke rup main jaanate the
 The problem with these bastions of secularism was that they are among the oldest areas of Mumbai, where the buildings are as old
 1 biechake kii hamaari khoj se hamaare saamne do vikalp aaeh ek ghar 100 saal puraani imaarat main teesri manzil par tha, or doosraa 80 saal puraani imaarat main duusari manzil par tha
 Both the buildings did not have elevators, no doors, nor parking space and their owners were helpless people who got their crores of rupees
 kii jaaydaad ke baavjood shahar ke kiraaya niyantran kanoon ke chalate pehle hi kaaphi sataae hue the
 a building stood on Manas wooden beams
 ve aisi imaaraten thim jo hamaare adhed umr ke hone tak bhi nahin khadi rahati, yah to bhul hi jaaen ki kavita or main apana budhapa kahaan bitaate
 We started our search for a home in the suburbs, along with that the auto-rickshaw ride started and often the appointment time was out with the agent
 hamane kai baar khushnuma maahaul vaali imaaraton ke vibhinn bade-bade flats par man bana liya, lekin tabhi hamen mumbai ke upnagaron main jivan ke buniyadi dhaanchon kii khamiyaan dikhne lageen-aniyamit jalaapurti, bijli kii mahangi daren or monsoon ke dauraan bilkul alag-thalag pad jane kaa khatra
 i have seen my friends and relatives buying flats in different areas of Mumbai for many years
 mujhe lagata tha ki ve log itane paise chukaakar itnaa kam sweekaar karne ke liye kyon taiyaar ho rahe hai
 The comparison between Mumbai and Manhattan is showy and funny
 neuyork main aapkaa paisa vasuul ho jaataa he
 You just pay money in Mumbai
 or phir aap kahin funs jate hai or vahaan dare-dare rahete hai
 Kavita and i lived like a paying guest in a flat by the sea during 2007
 tab tak maine ghar kii talash chhod di thi or kiraaya chukaakar khushi ke saath jeene kaa tarika sikh liya tha
 There was a large settlement of fishermen between our building and the Arabian Sea
 hamen lagata tha ki hamaare aaleeshaan ashiyane ke saamne yah basti ek dehati najaara pesh karti he
 a few weeks after entering our room, we were awakened by the sound of bhajans on a loudspeaker at 5 in the morning
 yah aawaaj usee basti se aa rahi thi
 Later in the morning our landlady told that it happens once a month
 unhone kuch bataaya jiskaa matlab yah tha ki machuaare samudr ke devataaon ko prasann karne ke liye prarthana kar rahe the
 During Holi, we had to tolerate the sound of music playing all day long and late at night
 or phir ganesh chaturthi ai to lagata tha ki laudspikar kabhi band nahin honge
 a flat in our building costs several crores

 ) Pakistan Test captain misbah-ul-haq believes that Shahid Afridi played a key role in uniting the team which had been in the news for most of the wrong reasons over the years

 We are making every decision with good coordination so everything is going well
 yah vastav main bahut badi baat he
 There is always a difference of opinion but we always have to listen to the captain
 prayek uske saath he
 He said, he has set an example in leading the team and his aggression is not the answer
 usne behtareen gendbaaji karke hamen sahi samay par wicket dilaae
 This helps the team when the captain performs well
 misabah ne kaha ki team ekajute he tathaa purv captain younis khan sahit sabhi senior khilaadi junior khilaadiyon kii madad kar rahe hai
 He said, the team members are well mingled
 sabase ahm baat yah he ki team ikai ke taur par khel rahi he
 Each player is performing better at the right time
 prayek vah bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he team usase jaisaa chaahati he

 shivasena ne mukhpatr saamana ke sampadakeey main anna hajaare ke ramlila maidan main kiye anshan par sawaal uthaaya he
 Saamana's editorial asks why Anna Hazare went to Delhi and what he achieved by going to Delhi
 bataa den ki anna hajaare pichley hafte dilli ke ramlila maidan main apni maangon ko lekar anishchit kaal ke anshan par baithen
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis mediated and gave written assurance to work on Anna's demands
 iske baad anna ne saat dinon main apana anshan tod diya
 It is written in Saamana that it is a good thing that Anna returns to her village in the right way, but what is gained by this fast, people are asking questions
 anna kaa vajan 6-7 kilo ghat gaya, lekin is andolan se haath kuch nahin aayaa
 It has been said in the article that what will be revealed by the previous movement, what will anyone disclose? Lokpal in the country and Lokayukta should be appointed in various states
 ye maang kal bhi thi, aaj bhi he or 6 maah ke baad bhi rahane vaali he
 In the article 'anna's condition like LK Advani', it says, "those who were raising slogans of Anna Zindabad in the previous movement of Anna and saying that the Lokpal should be done, they are all ruling in Delhi and other states
" anna kii haalat is vakt laalkrishna adwani jaisi ho gai he
 The only difference is that Advani is silent and Anna is speaking
 anna bhram main hai ki bolne se or bhukhe rahane se sarkaar sunegi
 The article said sarcastically that Fadnavis was going to break the fast due to the mediation
 anna kounheen par vishwaas karnaa tha, to ramlila maidan kii jagah anna apane gaanv ralegansiddhi main hi andolan karte
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Home Minister Rajnath Singh would go to Ramlila Maidan, it was not going to happen
 lekin centre kaa koi to cabinet mantri jayega aisa lag rahaa tha
 In the end it is written that Anna broke the offer by giving the next date
 bhrashtachari vaise hi hai, kisaanon kii maut bad rahi he

 Leaving Delhi, he is currently in Wardha, and has a major job of Mahatma Gandhi International University
 badhaaiyon kii is bheed main'sahitya ajtak'ne unase lambii baat kii, par bhaawanaaon kaa yah jowar aupchaarik nahin ho sakaa
 She is 75 years old today
 par is umr main bhi unka sochna, apane ko lekar nahin, balki apano ko lekar he, samaaj ko lekar he, us tabake ko lekar he, jinke liye unhone likhaa, jinase vah judi raheen

 The plot of 203 Nala Sopara boasts a wonderful struggle of eunuchs

 Although his mother also writes counter letters to his eunuch son, these letters remain in the background
 bete dwaara likhe gaye patron se hi maaloom hota he ki maa ne apane patr main kya likhaa tha!jayanti vishesh: disambar
 
 
 
 or raghuveer sahay kii yadamumbai kii life line samajhe jaani vaali local train ke western root par nalasopara lagbhag aakiri stesan he

 Despite being deeply attached to her middle son, Vinod, born as a gender convict, Vinod, a mother at the age of fourteen, feared the social pressure, the mental discomfort of the elder son-daughter-in-law within the house and, most of all, the terror of the eunuchs
 She is forced to hand over the eunuchs
 vinod har drushti se skool main pard rahe apane anya sahpaathiyon jaisaa hi he
 The only difference is that he cannot retire by opening the button of the pants adjacent to the boundary of the school
 jahaan tak padhai-likhaai kaa sawaal he, vah apni kaksha main sadaa first aata tha
 Despite this, his humor was pushed into such a hell, where even his identity is not only on the claim, but the existence itself comes in circles
 vinod main koi strain pravriti nahin he, isliye vah kinnaron ke gut kii lakh jabardastee or pratadna ke baavjood unke anukool nahin ho paata or shram karke jeena chahta he
 At one point in the novel, the protagonist writes to his mother, 'everyone turned their back on me
 par sapanom ne mujhase munh nahin pheraa
 Even today they come to me unhindered
 ' uskaa sapana he, saamaanya manushya kii bhaanti garimapurna jivan
 He repeatedly raises the question, why is genital disability considered such a big flaw? The only reason why he has to suffer the life of hell by cutting the most from home, family and relationships? Punyathi Special: Can not be forgotten 'kaal-katha' and Kamatanath Upanayas raises a big question how sex-worshiping society linguists Will tolerate? The novel compels one to think seriously on the question that why should a man have to be ostracized only because he is guilty of gender? The only reason why his hopes, dreams, aspirations, feelings are strangled? The novel strongly underlines that as long as our society remains sexually focused, this problem will remain

 The protagonist in the novel says, 'genital disability is a big flaw, but not so big that you believe that you are just the lower part of the torso
 mastishk nahin ho, dil nahin ho, dhadkan nahin ho, aankh nahin ho
 You have no arms and legs hai, hai, hai, sab vaise hi hai, jaise auron ke hai
 You are deprived of sexual pleasure
 You are not deprived of sexual pleasure
 bachche tum paidaa nahin kar sakate, magar pita nahin ban sakate, yah kisne nahin samajhane diya tumhen?'vinod urf binni yah bhi sawaal uthaata he ki ling kii drushti se kinnaron kaa vargeekaran kyon? unhen apana ling chunane kii swatantraaa honi chahie, na ki anya main daal diya jaae
 The Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes, the handicapped etc
 are all disadvantaged sections of the society, but they are also men and women
 thik isi tarah lingadoshiyon ko vargeekaran main inhen vanchiton ke saath rakhaa jaae
 Letter-style is considered most suitable for expressing thought-flow or thought-flow, but the author has done a unique experiment by expressing story-flow through it and has also been successful in it
 upanyaas is tathy ko bhi saamne laata he ki desh ke mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti kii dilchaspee kis tarah se asal samasya se alag he
 Politicians aim not to bring human dignity to the eunuchs, but only to use them as vote banks by luring reservation
 pehle to vinod main sambhaavna dekh kar sattadhari party use prashray detii he, par jaise hi vah aarakshan kii bheekh maangane kii jagah kinnaron main swabhimaan jagaane lagata he, uski hatya kar di jaati he
 The novel ends with an advertisement announcing the mother's public acceptance of her eunuch son in public just before her death, and sharing her property equally among the three sons
 jaahir he yah upanyaas kaaphi shodh or samvednaa kii maang karata he
 On the question of why he wrote this novel, Chitra Mudgal once said, "earlier i used to see Kinnar from the normal perspective
 masalan, anya logon kii tarah jab ye train, bas main paise maangane aate to manaa kar detii thi
 There was no sensitivity towards them
 par san 1979 main nai dilli railway stesan par train main ek kinnar mila tha
 When he told his story in the conversation, his eyes became moist and my perspective also changed
 uski kahani dimag main kaundh rahi thi
 She had told that only after passing the eighth she was handed over to Champabai and then to Tulsibai, who forced her to wear a sari
 ise likhane kii pehle to himmat nahin juta pai, lekin san 2011 kii janaganana main jab jiro adars kollam main inhen rakhaa gaya to main stabdh rah gai
 Decided to write a novel when other issues, including reservation, came to the fore
 'ab jab chitra mudgal kaa yah upanyaas na keval behad charchit hua, varan use puraskaar bhi mil chukaa he, tab vah is samaaj ke liye or bhi chaahati hai
 In an interview soon after the novel was awarded, he said, 'I want this novel to be included in the curriculum, so that the new generation will be inspired to honor the eunuchs
 ' unke khud ke shabdon main, 'aap itihaas dekhie sabal hameshaa nirbalon par julm karata rahaa he
 Women and Dalits were victims of this oppression, but due to discrimination, women and Dalits were never evicted from their homes, whereas the parents of eunuchs expelled them
 samaaj ne inako is dasha main kyon rakhaa, ye bhi ek sawaal he
 i tried to raise the same question
 'chitra mudgal apane jivan or lekhan se samaaj or usase jude masalon ko uthaane main hameshaa safal rahi hai
 He should have longevity and health, so that with his activism this society becomes better and Hindi literature continues to resonate
