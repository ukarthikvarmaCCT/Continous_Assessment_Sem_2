 ) The landmark decision of the House on the triple talaq bill has been questioned by AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main ovaisi ne kaha ki teen talaak bill paas hona koi aitihaasik faisla nahin he
 He said that this bill is against Muslim women and it is unfair to them

 He said that the law of triple talaq has been made for a class of groups
 ye kanoon supreme court main tikne vaala nahin he

 unhone kaha ki supreme court ne poxo act ke maamalon ke liye 500 court banaae, lekin iske baavjood 9 pratishat kanvikshan he
 The BJP is shedding crocodile tears for Muslim women simply by calling the triple talaq bill historic
 ovaisi ne kaha ki bijepi ko muslim mahilaon kii itani phikr he to unnav main hindu rape peedita ke maamle main kyon chup he
 Sometimes in the name of mob lynching, sometimes in the name of cow, now bjp's agenda is coming out

 He said that the All India Law Personal Board should challenge this wrong law in the Supreme Court

 aapako bataa den ki kairana main 28 may ko matdaan or 31 may ko matganana hogi
 While RLD has declared Tabassum from Kairana and SP Naimul Hasan from Nurpur as its candidate
 bijepi ne iske alaava pashchim bengal, jharkhand or uttarakhand upachunaav ke liye bhi ummidavaaron kaa elaan kiya he
 BJP fields Mriganka Singh for by-elections to Kairana (UP) Parliamentary constituency and Madhav Lal Singh, Munni Devi, Avani Singh, Sujit Ghosh for by-election to Gomia (jharkhand), Tharali (uttarakhand), Noorpur (UP) & Maheshtala ( West Bengal) Assembly constituencies

 At the same time, akhilesh-mayawati would like to retain her victory in Kairana also
 aise main kairana kii dharti par ek baar phir siyaasi yuddh kii bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 The daughter assumed the legacy of the father that bjp's Hukum Singh won the Kairana parliamentary seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isi saal 3 farvari ko unka nidhan ho jane ke chalate upachunaav ho rahaa he
 BJP has fielded Hukum Singh's daughter Mriganka Singh from this seat
 mriganka ko pita kii maut kii vajah se sahanubhuti vot mil saktaa he
 However, Mriganka has tried her luck in the assembly elections but had to beat sp's Nahid Hasan
 vidhansabha chunaav kaa samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat ke tahat paanch vidhansabha siten aati hai
 This Lok Sabha seat consists of Thanabhavan, Kairana and Shamli assembly seats in Shamli district, Gangoh and Nakur assembly seats in Saharanpur district
 maujuuda samay main in paanch vidhansabha siton main chaar bijepi ke paas hai or kairana vidhansabha seat sapa ke paas he
 The BJP received 4 lakh 33 thousand votes in these seats in 2017
 jabaki basapa pratyaashiyon ko 2 lakh 8 hajaar or sapa ke 3 pratyaashiyon ko 1 lakh 6 hajaar vot mili the
 The SP gave Shamli and Nakur seats to the Congress
 kairana loksabhaa kii siyasat itihascarana loksabhaa seat 1962 main vajood main ai
 Since then elections have been held 14 times
 inamen congress or bijepi do-do baar chunaav jeet saki hai
 These seats have been going into the account of different political parties
 kairana loksabhaa seat par pehali baar hue chunaav main nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par yashpal singh ne jeet darj kii thi
 Socialist Party in 1967, Congress in 1971, Janata Party in 1977, Janata Party (secular) in 1980, Congress in 1984, Congress in 1989, 1991, SP in 1996, BJP in 1998, Rashtriya Lok Dal in 1999 and 2004, BSP in 2009 And in 2014, BJP has won
 kairana kaa jaateey samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat par 17 lakh matadaata hai jinamein paanch lakh muslim, chaar lakh becoward (jat, gurjar, saini, kashyap, prajapati or anya shaamil) or dedh lakh vot jatav dalit he or 1 lakh ke kareeb gairjatav dalit matadaata hai
 The Kairana seat is considered to be Gurjar-dominated
 yahaan teen lakh gurjar matadaata hai inamen hindu-muslim donon gurjar shaamil hai
 That is why the candidates of Gurjar community have won this seat most of the times
 kairana main muslim siyasatkairana main muslim aabaadi acchhee khaasi hone ke baad bhi 14 loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj 4 baar hi muslim saansad bane hai
 There were two Muslim candidates against Hukum Singh of BJP in the 2014 election
 sapa ne nahid hasan ko or basapa ne kanvar hasan ko utaara tha
 In 2013, the Muzaffarnagar riots led to polarization of votes and Hukum Singh benefited from the Muslim vote split due to the presence of two Muslim candidates
 voton kaa sameekarnabijapi ko 5 lakh 65 hajaar 909 vot mili the
 While SP 3 lakh 29 thousand 81 votes and BSP 1 lakh 60 thousand 414 votes
 aise main agar sapa-basapa ke vot jod liye jaaen to bhi bijepi aage he
 But the story of 2014 and 2018 is different
 2017 main agar sapa-basapa ko mili vot dekhe jaaen or uske hisaab se upachunaav kaa andaja lagaaya jaae to sapa-basapa kii dosti, bijepi par baari pad sakati he
 What will happen if this happens, the original vote of the SP in Kairana is low, but the population of Muslims is large, which is considered as the vote bank of the SP
 jabaki isi seat par dalit vot kaaphi ahm hai
 Like the previous by-elections of UP, if the bsp's vote goes to the sp's seat, then there can be difficulties for the BJP
 jabaki bijepi ek baar apane maton ko ekajute karke 2014 jaisaa itihaas dohraane kii koshish karegi

 Trump, the Republican nominee, has defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton
 bharat main jyotishiyon ne pehle hi isaki bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki trump kaa palada baari rahane vaala he
 Here, according to astrology, we will see what caused Trump to overwhelm Hillary
 donald trump kaa janm 14 june 1946 ko neuyork ke jamaica main subah 10 bajkar 54 minute par hua tha
 Leo was lagna at the time of Trump's birth
 singh lagn main paidaa hone vaale vaise bhi kaaphi aakraamak or tej-tarraar hote hai
 If Mars is sitting together then it will be icing on the cake
 trump ke saath singh ke saath mangal bhi he
 Mars is very beneficial and strong for Leo ascendant
 singh lagn main mangal kaa saath hone kii vajah se trump kaa ravaiya behad khaas he
 This is also reflected in his activities
 chaahe wo nijee hon, profeshnal hon, rajnatik hon yaa saamaajik
 It has its own unique and unique way of dealing with the situation
 bijness ho yaa raajnneeti, har jagah kamyabitrump kii kundali ke mutabik lagn ke bhagwaan surya dasamesh main hai
 The tenth house is of karma or profession which gives infinite power and mind power
 is vajah se trump ko unki jindagi ke sarvocch par pahunchane main madad mili chaahe wo bijness ho yaa raajnneeti

 In the horoscope of the trump, Saturn is sitting with Venus in the twelfth house
 shani ke liye yah bahut acchhee dasha nahin he lekin shani 'vipareet rajyog' main bhi shaamil he or apane mitra shukr ke saath he
 For this reason, Trump had to work hard to become a successful businessman and his personality and mannerisms were also appreciated
 duusare bhav main brihaspati hone se trump ko kaaphi kamyaabi mili or dhan-daulat bhi aayaa
 Due to the presence of Mercury in the 11th house, he gained a lot of wealth
 chandramaa ne chauthe bhav main ghar kar liya he or yah ketu se prabhavit he
 Due to these two planets, there is a situation of confusion about the personality of the trump
 jab chandramaa prabhavit hota he to vyakti apane bare main bahut sochataa he or uske saamne uhapoh kii sthiti bani hoti he
 This also leads to misconception about many things

 Here, four-year-old tigress Unona got Hillary and Polar Bear named Felix won the trump

 After this, Kasab started firing bullets inside the ticketing counter
 railway master ko goli lagi, mujhe bhi kaanch ke tukade ghusane se chot lag gai, baaki ke 7-8 log bhi ghayal ho gaye
 After some time, the sound of gunfire started coming from a little distance, i went out dragging a little and started looking at the countless corpses lying below, some of which were still alive

 'keeps BJP in the footsteps', denying the question of joining BJP, Mathur said,' i also had a relationship with old BJP leader JP Mathur, even then i was a Congress soldier
 aajkal upi bijepi ke prabharee om maathur se bhi meri rishtedaari he
 But there is no question of going to a party like BJP
 usko to main apane kadamon main rakhata hum
 i have a family relationship with the Gandhi family

 At the same time, sources told India Today that the situation of 46 types of ammunition, about half a dozen types of mines and 10 weapons systems by the Indian Army has been found very worrying

 Behind this step, the government will try to leave more money in the hands of the people, so that the consumption can be boosted and the sluggish wheel of the economy can catch pace
 jidipi main kareeb 60 fisadi hissedari khapat kii he
 Earlier, the finance minister has made several announcements to support the economy
 isamen korporate tex main katautee or real estate sector ko di gai raahat mukhya thi
 But these steps have not seen any significant impact yet
 masalan, na to korporate tex main katautee ke baad kisi company ne bade puunjigat vyay kii ghoshnaa hi kii or na hi kisi utpaadon par kisi khaas chhot kaa elaan
 The figures of stuck projects and unsold houses also did not change much
 saste karj bhi is disha main koi khaas asar nahin dikhaa paae
 Significantly, the RBI has cut policy rates by 135 basis points five times during February to October
 sasta karj, mahangaai kaabo main, tex ghataakar utpaada saste karne kii koshish arthvyavastha ko sahaara dene ke tamaam prayaas kargar sabit nahin hue
 Now the bet is on giving more money to the people
 yani iskar kii chhot seemaa ko badha diya jaae or logon ko zyada paisa dekar kharch karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 But the big question is, will the tax relief be so motivating that people start spending? Buying a house and a car are the most accurate scales of sustainable consumption growth
 kaaron or ghar kii kharidari achche dinon kii kharidari hoti he
 But for this purchase, there is confidence in the future of cheap loans and more important than cheap house or car
 vyakti jab apane bhavishya ko lekar aashwast hoga tabhi agle paanch se bees saal tak ke liye karj lene kaa saahas juta paaegaa
 This is the reason that the highest sales of houses and cars were in those times when inflation was at peak and debt was also expensive
 logon ke haath main thode zyada paise chhodane se kya bharosa laut aayega? kyonki agar aisa hota to beete varshon main saatven vetan ayog lagu hone se mili raashi, jiesti kii dar ghataane se kam hui mahangaai ke baad kuch asar jarur padataa
 It is not that people do not have money
 kyonki agar aisa hota to bazaar main nivesh ke achche vikalp dikhte hi log bazaar main nahin kud padate
 irctc's IPO being successful, the stock market at its highest level, continued investment in mutual funds are the latest examples
 is par vichaar zyada jaruri he ki jarurat kis cheez kii he logon ke haath main zyada paisa chhodane kii yaa arthvyavastha main bharosa lautaane? kyonki tex katautee kaa kadam janata ko phayda pahunchayegaa isaki guarantee nahin lekin sarkari khajaane par isaki chot sau fisadi tay he
 To return to confidence in the economy, large government investment on infrastructure is needed
 jin korporates ko badi katautee di gai he unhen arthvyavastha main puunjigat nivesh ke liye baadhit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Because large investment will open both avenues of employment and demand
 nae rojgaar paidaa hone se hi arthvyavastha main bharosa lautega or us samay karj sasta na hone par bhi log ghar or gaadi kharidne kaa saahas juta paaenge

 The poster war between the BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has now gone beyond the point of mockery to reach the war of words
 buudhvaar ko shivasena ne saaf shabdon main chetavanee di he ki kisi bijepi netaa ne unke pramukh uddhav thakare kii tulana film 'sholay' ke jailer se kii he or party ise katai bardaasht nahin karegi
 Earlier, Shiv Senane on Tuesday posted posters mocking BJP president Amit Shah and burnt the effigy of the party's city unit chief Ashish Shelar in South Mumbai
 party chif ke badale party chif kii is niti ke kaaran sattarudh gathbandhan ke donon sahyogi dalon ke bich kii talkhi or bad gai he
 However, the ruling BJP at the Center has also warned that if the Shiv Sena leadership fails to rein in its cadres, then it is capable of giving an appropriate answer
 bhandari ke lekh se shuru hua puraa vivadadrasal, yah puraa maajaraa bijepi ke prakaashan ‘manogat’ main party ke mukhya pravaktaa madhav bhandari ke lekh se shuru hua
 In the article, Bhandari challenged the Shiv Sena to secede from power and compared party chief Uddhav Thackeray to the jailer role of comedian Asrani in 'sholay'
 is tulana se baukhalaaye shivasena kaaryakartaaon ne mangalvaar ko shahar main aise poster chaspaan kiye, jisamen amit shah or madhav bhandari 'sholay' ke kirdaaron ke paridhaan main najar aa rahe hai
 It featured Amit Shah as the main villain Gabbar Singh
 putala dahan ko lekar pehle bhi rahi he naarazgishivasena ne iske alaavaabijepishhar ikai ke pramukh ashish shellar kaa putala bhi dahan kiya gaya
 Whereas a few days ago, BJP had warned Shiv Sena against effigy burning of party leaders
 'uksaave ke baavjood shant rahi he bijepi'is mudde par pratikriya dete hue rajya bijepi ke sachiv or vidhaan pashard sujith singh thakur ne kaha, 'pichley kuch dinon main shivasena kaaryakartaaon ke lagaataar uksaave ke baavjood bijepi shant rahi he

 dilli kii purv siem shila dikshit ab rajdhani laut ai hai
 He has exploded as he returned
 dilli kii raajnneeti main kam or apni party main zyada
 He gave a statement that if the BJP has enough numbers to form a government, then it should form the government
 unka yah bayaan aate hi party main sannata chaa gaya
 Some leaders who did not like him made a strong statement against him
 congress ke ek purv vidhayak ne to unhen party se nikaalane tak kii maang kar daali
 The party brushed aside his statement
 udhar aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal jo dilli ko apni vyaktigat jaaydaad maanate hai, cheekh pade
 He made a quick statement that the BJP and the Congress were united
 lekin vah apana vakt bhul gaye jab congress kii madad se unhone sarkaar banaai thi or khud hi chhodkar chale gaye the
 He does not like the fact that the Congress supports the BJP in addition to his party
 vah is bayaan par bhadak uthe hai or jabardast pratikriya de rahe hai
 They believe that BJP should not get invitation to form government
 lekin kejariwal kii pareshaani gairavaazib he
 The BJP is still the largest party in the Delhi Assembly and if the Deputy Governor invites it to form the government, what is wrong with it? However, more important than that is the statement of Sheela Dixit
 jo log shila dikshit ko jaanate hai yaa unki raajnneeti kii style jaanate hai, unhen pataa he ki vah vakt kii nabj ko pahachaanati hai
 He is aware of the depth of Delhi's politics
 unka yah bayaan anayas diya gaya bayaan nahin he
 She knows that her party's popularity is at the moment and it will take time for her to get up
 isliye agar abhi turant chunaav karaae jate hai to unki party ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 There is hardly any increase in the number of mlas
 lekin agar koi sarkaar banati he to uske kaam kaaj par party kaa bhavishya tikaa rahegaa
 That is, if the ruling party does not do well or does not meet the aspirations of the people, then there will be an opportunity for the Congress to get something
 samay bitne ke saath logon main congress ke prati gussa bhi kam ho jayega
 Not only this, if the BJP forms the government with some kind of manipulation, then a bad message will go to the public
 agar vah sarkaar kuch nahin kar paati he to congress ke liye avasar behatar hote jaaenge
 That is, Sheila Dixit's thinking is correct
 vah raajnneeti kii chatur khilaadi hai or vakt kii nabj ko pakadati hai
 The ball is in the court of the Lieutenant Governor
 kejariwal kii bechaini badhati ja rahi he
 Sheila Dixit has made her debut here

 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNSC) main pakistan or china ko ek baar phir munh kii khaani padi
 Pakistan relented to its Aziz friend China to take the Kashmir issue to the UNSC, but both of them did not succeed
 baithak ke baad china ne aisa bayaan diya taaki pakistan bhi khush ho jaae or bharat naaraaz na ho
 On the other hand, Russia once again played friendship with India and said that it is not international but the matter between the two countries
 darasal pakistan ko samarthan dena ab china kii majaburi ban gaya he
 The Chinese ambassador said, it is clear that the constitutional amendment that India has made and this has changed the situation
 china ne is par chintaa jaahir kii or kaha ki kisi bhi ekatarfa faisle se bachanaa chahie or aisa karnaa vaid nahin he
 This statement of China clearly shows that it has not taken any aggressive attitude towards India
 usne vahi kiya jo pakistan ko khush karne ke liye vah kar saktaa tha
 China has invested heavily in Pakistan
 donon deshon ke bich 46 billian dollar kii badi laagat se china pakistan economic coridor (CPEC) ban rahaa he
 Its purpose is to supply oil and gas from Pakistan to the northwestern region of Xinjiang via Gwadar port, railway and highway
 yah galiyara pakistan adhikrut kashmir, gilgit-baltistan or baluchistan hote hue jayega
 Gwadar port is being constructed in such a way that 19 million tonnes of crude oil can be sent directly to China
 lekin china is mudde par bharat ko sidhe taur par kuch kah bhi nahin saktaa
 Because the Hong Kong issue is no less than Kashmir for him
 darasal honkong britain kaa ek upnivesh tha or 1997 main britain ne honkong ko swytta kii shart ke saath china ko saunpa tha
 During this time Hong Kong was promised to maintain its political, independence, social and legal system
 isi vajah se honkong main rahane vaale log khud ko china kaa hissaa nahin maanate or sarkaar kii aalochana karne main peeche nahin rahete
 So if China has said something directly to India, then India can also surround it on the Hong Kong issue

 Disclosure: petm kii swaamitv vaali company van97 ne gagetts 360 main nivesh kiya he
 The day of Tuesday 30 June is officially going to be a second long, because our time will stop for a second on Tuesday
 yani aam taur par jahaan ek minute main 60 second hote hai, vahiin 30 june ko din kaa aakhri minute 61 second kaa hoga
 The US Space Science Agency NASA has confirmed this
 darasal, ek din main 86,400 second hote hai, lekin30 junako is samay main ek atirikt second yani lip second jud jayega
 According to Daniel mcmillan of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, NASA, 'the Earth's rotation is slowly slowing down so it has added an extra leap second
 ' aisa koordinated universal time yani utisi ke mutabik he, jiskaa istemaal log dainik jivan main karte hai
 UTC is atomic time, where the duration of a second is based on the predicted electromagnetic transition occurring in the atoms of the cesium
 ye transishan itane adhik vishwasaneey hote hai ki sisium clock 1,400,000 varshon tak sahi ho sakati he
 NASA issued a statement, 'earth's rotation is slowing down due to the force of gravity between the Earth, the Moon and the Sun
 'kyon joda ja rahaa he lip secondetomic or solar time main saamanjasy ke liye 1 janvari 1960 ko utisi kii vyavastha laai gai
 Since 1972, the UTC has been modified to add leap seconds if needed
 iske liye june yaa disambar main aakhri minute main ek atirikt second joda jaataa he
 The addition of additional seconds is done by the International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service
 aise main in do maap mulyon ke tulykaalan ke liye 30 june ke aakhri minute main samay ek second ke liye ruk jayega
 As soon as this happens, the last minute will be 61 seconds
 kya lip year kii tarah he lip secondalip year ke niyam ke tahat har chaar saal par calendar main ek atirikt din joda jaataa he
 This is done because the earth takes 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds of extra time to revolve around the sun
 haalanki, isse ulat lip second kii aisi koi gananaa nahin kii ja sakati ki vah ek niyat avadhi ke baad kab joda jayega
 It depends on many things, including rotation on the Earth's own axis, mobility of the Earth's center, variations in the atmosphere, oceans, groundwater, and ice storage
