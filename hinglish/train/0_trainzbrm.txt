 kuch baton ko lekar brahma ji, bhagwaan shiv ko apshabd kehane lage jiske baad bhagwaan shiv ko gussa aa gaya
 Kaal Bhairav appeared with Lord Shiva's anger and he had beheaded Brahma
 iske baad brahma ji chaturmukh ho gayi the
 Kaal Bhairav was accused of killing Brahm
 bhagwaan shiv ne bhairav se kaashi main prasthaan karne ko kaha
 Where Bhairava was liberated from killing Brahm
 rudra ne inhen kaashi kaa kotwaal niyukt kiya
 Even today they are worshiped as the Kotwal of Kashi
 kaha jaataa he ki baba vishwanath kaashi ke raja hai or kaal bhairav unke kotwaal, jo logon ko aashirwad bhi dete hai or sajaa bhi
 Yamraj also does not have the right to punish the humans here
 unke mutabik, kaal bhairav ke darshan maatr se shani kii saadhe saati, adhaiya or shani dand se bachaa ja saktaa he

 No one can enter the city without the permission of Kaal Bhairav

 Vinayakwriter: Rameshchandra Shahrajkamal Publication Price 400 Rs
 rameshchandra shah kii rachana gobar ganesh ko ‘‘vinayak’’ ke taur par ‘‘siddhi’’ mili or vinayak dhanya hua
 Vinayak received the Sahitya Akademi Award as an award, due to which he has become a source of irritation and resentment for many people
 virodh kitaab se zyada uske lekhak ko lekar he
 The irony is that in Hindi literature-society, the author is less known than his creation, because of his appearance, upbringing, accompaniment, faction
 isi aadhaar par uskaa koti-nirdhaaran hota he-vam koti, dakshin koti, samaajawaadee koti, madhyamargi koti yaa ‘‘doodh-bhaat’’ koti bhi, jisamen bechaara lekhak kisi bhi koti main rakhe jane laayak nahin mana jaataa
 Some people think that the composition of Shah Gobar Ganesh is more advanced and superior in terms of storytelling
 unhen uske liye hi sahitya academy puraskaar mil janaa chahie tha
 According to him, the emphasis in Vinayaka is less on narrative, more on philosophy
 vahiin shah ke kissa gulam ko hindi upanyaas kaa kai saal pehle hi dalit nayak uplabdh karaane kaa shrey bhi he
 In fact, Vinayaka is a far ahead creation not only in the story element, but also in terms of his vast narrative and story
 uskaa vijan anokhaa he
 Vinayak is the story of a Kaliyugi character looking at an epistemological perspective that propels him to become a global citizen by elevating him from a complacent person
 vinayak kaa naayakatv aaj kii shakti kii chaah rakhane vaali, dhanalolup, hinsak duniya main ek vilakshan ghatana he jiskaa aagrah eksatta ke badale bahusattaaon ko khadaa karnaa he
 He fell into the pit of selflessness and overconfidence, blinding him from the west, blindfolding him, and sitting in it with his companions, calls for the "indian" society to make its own path
 vah purvi sabhyataa ko apane andar jhaankne or pashchim samaaj kii ankhon main ankhen daalkar barabari kaa muqabla karne ko kahata he
 Vinayak is committed to the creation of a polytheistic and pluralistic system against the system of one God, one religion, one power, one ideology unjust and forcibly subjugating him
 uski chaah vikendrit or loktantric duniya he
 As for Shah, before this award and even today he remains a very original and distinct signature of Indian literature, free from any one ideology or genre

 However, if we look at the data, more than the rise in the price of crude oil globally during the last few months is responsible for the continuing decline in the rupee against the dollar in the international currency market

 vahiin 2018 main jab kaccha tel sheersh str par tha tab prati bairal kaccha tel kharidne ke liye bharat ko 5,669 rupee kharch karne pade
 Therefore, India had to spend 47 percent more in purchasing crude oil for rupee

 But with the rise in the prices of crude oil as well as the continuing fall in the rupee, the import bill of the central government in purchasing crude oil is getting thicker and its trade deficit is increasing

 After this Argentine performance, fans have taken their anger out on Twitter
 This World Cup is making Christiano Ronaldo look more like GOAT and Messi look more like he was made great by possibly the greatest club side / midfield of all time

 Former minister Kapil Mishra in Aam Aadmi Party government has written a letter to Arvind Kejriwal asking the reason for his suspension
 ek ke baad ek 12 sawaal karte hue mishra ne party kaa samvidhan bhi saajha kiya he, jise unhone political afaire kamity ke tamaam sadasyon ko bheja he
 Mishra has sought an answer from the AAP leaders within 7 days
 udhar sutron kii maane to party ne shikaayat milane ke baad nilamban kaa faisla liya tha, jisaki ek kamity philhal jaanch kar rahi he
 Read the letter written by Kapil Mishra to Arvind Kejriwal - Respected National Convenor: Aam Aadmi Party Topic - Aam Aadmi Party's notice on violation of party constitution by PAC, suspension of process and violation of rules
 Sending members aapke netritv main party kii PAC ke dwaara party samvidhan kaa ulanghan karke, bina prakriyaaon kaa paalan kiye, bina mujhe koi notice die, bina mujhe apni baat kehane kaa avasar die jis prakaar mere nilamban kii ghoshnaa kii gai va uske baad bhi lagbhag 2 maheene tak mujhe is sambandh main kisi bhi prakaar kaa koi notice va jaankaree na die jane ke sandarbh main ye notice he
 Some questions: -1
 kya mujhe party kii sadsyta se nilambit karne kaa faisla party kii PAC ke dwaara kiya gaya he? yadi haa, to ye faisla kab kiya gaya, kis meeting main? kripaya us meeting main sabhi minutes saarvajanik kiye jaae
 2
 yadi party kii PAC ne mujhe nilambit kiya he, to kripaya ye bataaen ki mere khilaaf kya shikaayat thi va ye shikaayat PAC ko kisne va kab kii thi?3
 According to the constitution of the party, the decision to suspend any member can only be made in the event of disciplinary proceedings pending, whereas till date there is no pending disciplinary proceedings of any kind
 4
 According to the constitution of the party, without giving an opportunity to speak, no disciplinary action is possible against anyone, then any decision taken about me is illegal
 aisa gaiyr kanoonee nirnay karne kaa kaaran kya he?5
 According to the constitution of the party, any member having his independent views cannot cause suspension of the member
 party kaa pramukh objective bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaanaa he or mere dwarabhrashtachar ke khilaafaaawaj uthaane par mujhe gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se nilambit kyon kiya gaya?6
 i want to tell you that if the party's PAC has decided to suspend me, then it is illegal because a
 maine party ke mul objective yani bhrashtachar se ladane kaa hi kaam kiya he
 b
 mere khilaaf anushaasanamak kaarywahi hetu na koi cameti banaai gai, na mujhe koi notice diya gaya, na mujhe apni baat rakhane kaa avasar diya gaya or na hi us din kii PAC kii meeting ke koi minutes, kis sadsy ke kya kaha, kya is sandarbh main PAC main koi voting hui, aisi koi bhi jaankaree abhi tak mujhe nahin di gayi
 c
 sadsy ke nilamban hetu party ke samvidhan main jitne bhi praavdhaan he, sabhi kaa khuleam ulanghan kiya gaya he
 Is the party PAC larger than the party's constitution? 7
 kya aisa nirnay karte samay PAC ke saamne mere khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa koi bhi maamla yaa shikaayat thi?8
 i made public the party's national convenor to be corrupt, his relatives involved in corruption and raised the corruption cases of a minister of the government, is it a crime in the party's constitution? 9
 gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se nilambit karne kii ghoshnaa karne ke baavjood, party ke sanyojashravind kejarivalvidhansabha ke har satr main vip jari karwaakar mere vot kii bheekh kyon maangate he?10
 Begging for whip to vote on party line in the assembly and to be suspended illegally outside the assembly, what else is foolish? 11
 main aapako va PAC ke sabhi sadasyon ko chunauti detaa hoon ki mantri ke taur par mere dwaara kiye gaye sabhi kaaryo, nirnyon va filon ko saarvajanik kar diya jaae
 As a Chief Minister, you can do this immediately
 main chunauti detaa hoon ki meri, aapaki va sabhi mantriyon kii sabhi filon ko saarvajanik kar diya jaae
 Anyone who proves corrupt should be expelled from the party
 bataaiye haiaam aadmi partiki PAC main ye himmat?12
 i give you and all the members of the PAC time to respond to my notice within 7 days and also instruct that the entire party's constitution should not be dismantled in order to save a few corrupt people
 aapkakapil mishra Sometimes i wonder how many writers writing meaningful writing are cut off from the mainstream of Hindi
 bihar ke lekhakon ko lekar hindi kii mukhyadhara kuch adhik hi nirmam rahi he
 i find today the speech of Namwar Singh in which he said that writers like Renu corrupted the Hindi language
 baharhaal, champaran main rahane vaale hindi-bhojpuri ke kavi, sahityasevi dinesh bhramar kii gajalon ko jab padhaa, unke bare main yuva lekhak amitesh kumaar kii tippanee padhi, to phir se vahi dard tabhakane laga
 Is Hindi mainstream only from Banaras to Delhi? For the moment, read Dinesh Bhramar's Ghazals with a short comment by Amitesh on Dinesh Bhramar
 - prabhaat ranjandinesh bhramar ne sahitya sadhana kam vayas main shuru kii thi
 He was one of the earliest creators of Navgeet in Hindi
 bhojpuri main pehali baar ghazal likhane kaa shrey unheen ko he, ve gazalen bhojpuri sahitya ke paathyakramon kaa hissaa he
 Dinesh Bhramar had to return to the village to take care of his family after his death
 adhyapaki or parivaar main unhone parivaar ko chunaa (jyeshtha hone ke naate bhi)
 The presence of him or those like them will not be found in the mainstream Hindi scenario
 lekin bagaha jaise kasbaai shahar main rahete hue unhone saahitiyik maahaul ke nirmaan main amuly yogadan diya he
 It is known by the people of that city and the city around it
 unhone bagaha, betia, narkatiyaganj, motihaari jaise shaharon main lagaataar saahitiyik aayojan karawaaye hai
 He has shared the stage with great poets on the stage of poets' conferences, including a name of agnostic
 in panktiyon ke lekhak ke saahitiyik sanskaar main unki mukhya bhoomika rahi he
 While living in Bagaha, i got a chance to listen to poets like Bashir Badr, Shriram Tiwari, Sagar Azmi, Nida Fazli, Wasim Barelvi
 kai rashtriya str ke kavi sammelnon main shariq hua
 Many of the poets got a chance to flourish under his umbrella in Bagaha
 unke pustkaalay main se kai pustak padhane ko mili
 He is one of the few subscribers in the Hindi magazines of Bagaha
 kavi kii prakhar pratibha or gayan par bharpoor pakad ke baavjood ve bagaha se baahar ke paridrishy main yadi adhik charchit nahin hue to iske liye unki udaseenta hi nahin hindi kii varchasvvaadi dhara bhi jimmedaar he, jisane aisi kai pratibhaaon ko uske daay se vanchit kiya he
 The disinterest in publishing his poems of Bhramar ji can be gauged from the fact that his only collection of poems was printed 'geet Mere Swar Tumhare' but this collection is not with him
 chini milon kii purgiyon, akhabaaron, kaagaj ke tukdon par likhi kavitaayen bhi bikhri hui hai
 His poetry has been remembered by his friends because of his association
 ye gazalen bhi isi tarah sarankshit hai :1
 Every morning it is started, then like darkness
 ye dhundhalaka chal rahaa hamako savere kii tarah
 The head was bowed with shame, of Qutub Minar
 rahanuma ladate jahaan, teetar bateron kii tarah
 What is good for today's relationships? jab sage bhi pesh aate hai, chacheron kii tarah
 Of all the sleeves, there is a poisonous snake
 aaj insaan lagata he, saperon kii tarah
 His body is becoming ruddy like Gulmuhar
 jism pilaa pad rahaa, apana coneron kii tarah

 kahin sawan kahin gagan barase
 Know what memories it rained
 kya ho saakaar swapn samta kaa
 Rattan rained somewhere
 yaad kii gandh mahak buundon kii
 It seems that it rained
 kaisaa achraj he ek hi kshan main
 Life rained somewhere
 nile anchal main chamak sandal kii
 As if a ray of light came from the sky
 kaali alkon se sarakati boonden
 For example, there was no money left

 See you, like a stranger
 jeena mushkil he aadmi kii tarah
 Yesterday, Sahara had the fingers
 aaj uthati he tarjani kii tarah
 The deity was in the eyes of someone
 aaj bhikshuk hum bharthri kii tarah
 The era has hurt so much
 bolta jab hum anbhavi kii tarah
 Savani Bagmati came out
 jinako samajhataa tha gomti kii tarah

 ajanabi lag rahaa shahar apana
 The house looks like its own
 mulk ko baant ke na dil baanto
 Keep your skills near you
 sara akaash pad gaya chota
 Sir was ever so high
 ab to paravaaz se wo ghabadaata
 Have cut themselves on themselves
 jab bhi kehane ko ghazal baitha hum

 Today, robots equipped with virtual reality, augmented reality, hologram and haptic hologram technology are being created, but Digi Sexuality is much more than this

 And his runny nose was a result of the extremely cold weather in the US, where he recorded this EP this year
 kuhad kehete hai, "jab main neuyork main utraa, thik usee din shahar main barfila tufaan aa gaya
 (it) was just a few days before the track's debut in Nashville

 The EP is available for streaming on Saavn, soundcloud and youtube

 Kuhad's 2015 album In Token and Charms and earlier English and Hindi albums also recorded a relationship
 magar vah rishta ab dostana dhang se khatm ho chukaa tha
 This time they were far more turbulent and desperate and this upheaval is reflected in both the lyrics and the artwork of Cold / Mess
 "aai vish aai kud live you maay lav bat maay heart is ammes'' (kaash main tumhen chhod paata mere pyaar par meraa dil bahut betaratib he)
 This is what they sing in the title cut
 ummid ke mutabik, hindustani aaazaad khyaal sangeet ke is sabase bade romantic kii lambii femail folowing he
 "we were in Saavn's office (where he showed us) that 75 per cent of his other works were male and 25 per cent female," says Kuhar
 "I am the only one in which this ratio has completely reversed
" ''cold / mess main us kism kii sweekaaroktiyaan bhari padi hai jinaki ummid unke mureed kuhad se karne lage hai
 His ability to connect and compose music about the affairs of the heart has brought him into the ranks of the country's most popular singer-songwriters
 apane nae album ke pramotion ke liye ve desh bhar main niklenge
 He feels that such intimate songs also require an intimate pane
 pichley kuch saalon main ve itane kaamyaab to ho hi gaye hai ki apni sharton par kuch kar saken—ve aayojakon se kah sakate hai ki tikat bikri kaa ek hissaa unhen den (kul raashi jisamen se aane vaale kalakaaron ko yatra or thaharne vagairah ke kharch bhi chukaane hote hai) ke alaava
 They also have creative control over such projects
 haal hi main bollywood kii aane vaali film kaaravaan main unhone do dhune di hai
 Although he was "a bit freaked out" but still a little apprehensive that at the last minute he would change my song or confuse something
 qaraar main ve is baat ko lekar bilkul saaf the ki (ve) koi badlaav nahin kar sakate
 This work gave him a chance to do something different
 ve kehete hai, "ek gane ke vaaki inspireshnal hone kii ummid he; us tarj par pehle kabhi kuch nahin likhaa tha
 "kuhad does not consider his Bollywood work to be a playback singer
" "maine ise likhaa he, guitar bajaayaa he, puri cheez produs kii he, to yah puri tarah meraa baccha hua naa
 They may also include some of these in their live sets
 kuhad kehete hai, "meri agali relies main kai piano song honge kyonki in dinon vahi likh rahaa hum
 He moves his fingers fast to the guitar and keyboard in his show to play melodies like his last Hindi solo song "tum Jab Pass" and the yet to be recorded English composition "darling Darling"

 Film director Deepa Mehta's web series Laila is in discussion these days
 is siries kii kahani bhavishya par aadhaarit he
 Which depicts the exploitation of women in the name of civilization and culture
 is film kii kahani mukhya kirdaar shalini rigwan choudhary (huma kuraishi) ke aas-paas gumti najar aati he
 The story of this series reflects the society of 2047
 jahaan ek taqatvar insaan gurumata khud sabhyataa or samskruti kaa thekedaar bana hua he
 Which teaches a lesson to those who go against the culture
 unki jaan tak le letaa he
 Actually, the story of this series seems inspired by the story of a Delhi ashram and its operator Baba
 jiskaa pardaafash 19 disbanr 2017 main hua tha
 The police raided there
 ham baat kar rahe hai dilli ke aadhyatmik ishwariya vishvavidhyalay or uske sanchaalak baba virendra dev dikshit kii
 Everyone was surprised when his ashram and misdeeds were revealed
 desh ke kai shaharon main aadhyatm kii shiksha dene ke naam par wo mahilaon or ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar or shaareerik shoshan karne ke aaropon se ghira he
 The black acts of Dhongi Baba Virendra Dev Dixit had also become a problem for the country's largest investigative agency CBI
 sibiai ne virendra dev dikshit par 5 lakh kaa inaam ghoshit kiya tha
 Virendra Dev Dixit used to run the ashram of Ayyashi in the name of Spiritual God University
 jahaan ladakiyon ko jabaran bandhak banaakar rakhaa jaataa tha or baba unka yon shoshan karata tha
 The investigation into the case was handed over to the CBI by the Delhi High Court after several days of uproar by the victims' families
 laila web siries main bhi ek ashram jaisi socity 'aryavrat' dikhaai gai he
 Whose director is Joshi, but the whole work is seen by a man named Gurumaan (arif Zakaria)
 ye kirdaar kahin naa kahin virendra dev se prerit najar aata he
 Which is the head of the plush society 'aryavrata'
 vahaan usee kaa raaj chalata he
 The series showed that Gurumans can go to any extent to renounce their religion and culture and bring women married in other communities on the path
 ye bilkul vaisaa hi he, jaise virendra dev apane ashram main bandhak banaai gai mahilaon ke saath pesh aata tha
 Guruman tortures women likewise
 unki pitayee karaata he
 He gets all the work done by the society
 virendra dev apane ashram main aadhyatmik shiksha dene ke naam par mahilaon kaa shoshan karata tha
 In this series, it is shown how the stray women are purified
 or shuddhikaran ke naam par unka shoshan kiya jaataa he
 Many episodes shown in the series are seen telling the story of Delhi's hypocrite Baba Virendra Dev
 6 episod kii is siries ke ek drishy main shalini ek imaarat kii chat se khadey hokar duusari imaarat par pathar phenkati he
 So that someone comes forward to help him from there
 lekin koi nahin aata he
 The same happened in the spiritual university of Delhi
 vahaan to ashram kii chat bhi gril se band thi

 is web siries main dikhaaya gaya ki kaise shalini rigwan choudhary (huma kuraishi) apane pati or beti laila ke saath khushhaal jindagi ji rahi hoti he, lekin ek din achaanak kuch anjaan log unke ghar main ghuskar uske pati kaa katl kar dete hai
 And take Shalini up her daughter
 vaise hi virendra dev ke saath kaam karne vaale kuch log aisi mahilaon ko talash karte the, jo kisi bhi tarah se pareshaan hoti thi
 Then, in the name of help and spirituality, they were brought to the ashram and taken hostage
 ve mahilaayein kabhi baahar nahin ja paati thim
 Virendra Dev Dixit, who runs a hypocrisy shop all over the country, made Rohini in Delhi his home

 is dauraan vahaan se 41 ladkiyaan baraamad huin, jinamein se 3 ladkiyaan ritred inspector kii thim

 But somewhere, a big message is also visible in this series, which is based on the future water shortage, environmental problems and exploitation of women
 wo kahin bhi baith jate hai, kahin bhi kha lete hai or kahin bhi khule aasmaan ke neeche chadar daalkar so lete hai
 Someone comes and scolds them, convincing them again and again that you were born to work just like a machine
 tumhaara apana kehane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he tumhaare paas
 The workers call it no! Read these two poems written on the workers: 1
 thake majdoor rah-rah kar jugat aisi lagaate hai (omprakash yati)thake majdoor rah-rah kar jugat aisi lagaate hankabhi kheni banaate hai kabhi bidi lagaate hainjahan nadiyon kaa pani chune laayaq bhi nahin lagataahamaari aasthaa he ham vahaan dubkee lagaate hanzaruratmand ko do pal kabhi dena nahin chahabhale ham mandiron main line lambi lagaate hanyaha par kursiyaan baqayada nilaam hoti hanchalo kuch or badhkar boliyaan ham bhi lagaate hainheen nafrat ko phalne-phoolne se roktaa koiyaha to prem par hi log paabandi lagaate hai

 " Asus ROG Phone 2 gaming ke liye shandaar divaais he
 Its camera disappoints
 bydaree byaap shandaar he
 In terms of performance, it is killer
 Asus ROG siries kaa nayaa smartphone ROG 2 bharat main uplabdh he
 This smartphone is high end and has top specifications
 PUBG ke baad se bharat main multiplayer mobile gaming kaa craij badha he
 After this, Call of Duty has also launched the mobile version
 dilachasp ye he ki COD: Mobile ne downlod ke maamle main PUBG Mobile ko peeche chhod diya he
 This smartphone is very special for gaming
 lekin aisa nahin he ki is smartphone par aap sirf gaming hi kar sakate hai
 This smartphone also has two rear cameras
 iske alaava or bhi kaaphi kuch smartphone main he
 Like every phone, this smartphone also has some drawbacks along with the features that we will tell you in this review
 dizin or bild qualitypasus ROG 2 ko hold karne ke baad sabase pehle aap iskaa vajan notice karenge
 It is of 240 grams which is heavy feel
 duusare flagship se iskaa vajan kahin zyada he
 The phone is big and build quality solid
 dizin vahi he jo haal ke smartfones main dekhte aae hai
 It uses an aluminum frame and has a glass metal sandwich design
 rier panel slipri he, lekin iske saath diya gaya cese acchhee grip detaa he
 Especially during gaming
 rier panel par karvd glass he is vajah se hold karne main aasaani hoti he
 Two cameras and two LED flash modules are provided on the rear panel and the center is branded by ROG
 rier panel par graphics he jo aakarshak lagata he
 On the right side is the home button with volume rocker keys
 bottm main headphone jaik diya gaya he or USB Type c port he
 The second USB Type c port is in the left site of the phone so that it can be used during portrait mode
 front main phul vyuu disple di gai he or protection ke liye yahaan Gorilla Glass 6 diya gaya he
 In terms of design and build quality, this smartphone is such that some people may like it, while some may find it slightly outdated
 displekisi bhi gaming smartphone kii khaasiyat isaki disple se shuru hoti he
 Because no matter how high the performance smartphone is, if the display is not good, then you will not get the feel that you want in gaming
 disple ke chaaro taraf bejals hai or ye isliye hai, taaki gaming ke dauraan phone par aapaki pakad acchhee rahe or gaming prabhavit na ho
 The screen has a refresh rate of 120hz and this feature has become a necessity for gaming performance
 isamen company ne OLED panel kaa yuj kiya he or screen sies 6
 59 inches
 disple brit or colorphul he or maiks britaness 600 nits tak jaati he
 Overall the display of this smartphone is quite aggressive and we liked it
 parformansaishaugh Phone 2 main Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus diya gaya he, jo abhi Qualcomm kaa letest procesar he
 This smartphone has 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage
 maine is smartphone main do game sabase zyada khele hai – Call of Duty: Mobile or PUBG Mobile
 Obviously COD: Mobile is better than PUBG in terms of graphics and overall quality
 phul graphics karke gaming ek alag level kaa experience detaa he
 It is very comfortable to hold the phone during gaming and the grip is good
 gaming ke dauraan bydaree dren hoti he or isse bachane ke liye aap ise charge par laga sakate hai
 Therefore, UBS Type c is also given in the port side so that you can also gaming comfortably by putting it in charge
 hamane paaya he ki charging ke dauraan bhi gaming main ye phone garm nahin hota he
 Let us know that this smartphone supports gaming accessories and the company sells it, but we have reviewed it without any accessories
 phone ke left age par Air Triggers die gaye hai
 To activate it, you have to go to the game's settings
 jab aap game open karenge aapako settings kaa opshan milegaa
 During gaming, you can access Geme Genie by swiping left
 ye ek tarah kaa control centre he jahaan aapako kai opshans milenge
 From here, you will be able to speed up, turn on air trigger, record screen and can also access real time information
 iske alaava Geme Genie main aapako phone kaa temprechar, frem prati seconds, procesar speed dikhegaa
 The air trigger works quite well and you can also use it for fire
 haalanki iske liye aapako thodi practice kii jarurat hogi
 Apart from gaming, the experience of using videos, social media and other apps has also been good
 phone lag nahin karata he or multi tasking ke liye bhi acha he
 There is also no problem of getting hanged
 phone fast he, smood he or powerful parformens vaala he
 However, i have turned on gaming continuously for a few days and during this time the game seems slow to load
 reestart karne ke baad thik hota he
 Not only this, at the end of gaming or the initial screen load, it is slow compared to other smartphones in this segment and it is quite disappointing
 mumkin he ise software ptch ke jariye thik kiya jayega
 Camera ROG Phone 2 has a dual rear camera setup
 primary lens 48 megapixl he or iskaa aparchar f / 1
 Is 79
 iske saath phase ditection autofocus kaa bhi saport he
 The second camera is 13 megapixels which is ultra wide angle and its aperture f / 2
 4 he
 On the photography front, this smartphone is average
 acchhee tasviren clic kar sakate hai, lekin ye ‘great’ kii shrenee main nahin aati hai
 Photos contain details, but sharp and crisp will not be found
 photose ko juum karne par grence dikhenge
 Photos are good in good light, but if the lighting condition is bad then the photos are not good
 bhale ye gaming smartphone he, lekin company ko photography par thodaa or kaam karnaa chahie tha
 Audio part is very important for audiogaming smartphones
 ROG Phone 2 main company ne shandaar spikars die hai jo gaming ke expirience ko or bhi behatar karte hai
 This smartphone has front facing stereo speakers
 audio kaaphi laud he or isaki quality bhi acchhee he
 You can do gaming without earphones and you will easily hear the sound of the steps of the appointee
 kuch equalizer opshans bhi milte hai
 From here you can set audio according to your own
 wibrasion motors bhi apana kaam sahi se karte hai
 Battery backup The battery backup of ROG Phone 2 is excellent
 is smartphone main 6,000mah kii powerful bydaree di gai he or ye lambey samay tak kaa byaap dene main puri tarah sakasham he
 In mixed use, you can withdraw 3 days of backup from this smartphone, although i got a little more backup than 2 days
 isamen gaming bhi shaamil he, lekin ek ghante se zyada nahin
 The 30W hypercharger is also available with this smartphone, which is given in the box
 phone fast charge hota he or lagbhag aadhe ghante main phone 45% se zyada charge ho jaataa he
 The 120hz refresh rate drains the battery quickly, but you can also save the battery by lowering the refresh rate from the Quick Settings
 kya aapako ROG Phone 2 khareednaa chahie?rog Phone 2 kii keemat bharat main 37,999 rupee se shuru he
 This model has 128GB storage with 6GB of RAM, the second model has 512GB of memory with 8GB of RAM and is priced at Rs 59,999
 agar aap gaming ke shaukeen hai to ye smartphone aapke liye shandaar he
 But at this price, you need a good camera along with gaming, so you have other options in this segment
 parformens ke lihaaj se bhi aap is smartphone ko kharid sakate hai

 unhone kaha, ‘vah ayog bharat jayega, uske nishkarsh pakistan main nyaayik prakriya ke liye mahatvapurn honge
 When he has his conclusions, he will shed light on all the legal aspects, then there will be judicial progress in this regard
 ’yah puche jane par nyaayik ayog bharat main kitne din rukegaa, malik ne kaha ki ayog teen-chaar din tak vahaan rukegaa, jab tak aap unhen ‘mehmaan ke taur par sweekaar karenge
 "he was asked when the case would end, the minister's reply was that the process would begin as soon as the report comes," but it is too early to tell how long it will take

 rahul gandhi kaa gussa to koi khaas gul nahin khilaa paaya lekin upi kii janata ne apane gusse kii puri bhadaas bispi par utaari
 In the last election, riding on the overwhelming majority, Mayawati's elephant had reached the peak of power in Lucknow, in the same way, the anger of the public also showed the party outward
 rahul ne khub gussa dikhaaya, maharashtra main upi ke logon ke bheekh maangane kii baat kahkar unki aatma ko bhi lalakaara lekin upi kii janata ke gusse kii aanch main samaajawaadee party ne apni cycle ko lakhanu kii gaddi tak pahunchaa diya
 The Uttar Pradesh elections, which lasted for 7 stages, also brought some such moments and some leaders also showed their acting tricks in front of which even the best scripts of Bollywood demanded water
 congress ke yuvaraj kahe jane vaale mahasachiv rahul gandhi ko hi le len
 He had a completely different look in this election and that was the form of 'angry Young Man'
 film 'diwaar' ke amitabh bachchan vaale andaaj main rahul gandhi ne uttar pradesh main jagah-jagah jaakar apana gussa dikhaaya
 His anger was towards Mayawati and her elephant, who used to grab all the money that came for the poor
 unka gussa us samaajawaadee party kii taraf bhi tha, jise ve muslimon ke pichhadepan ke liye jimmedaar maanate hai
 His anger is particularly high that the people of UP have to go to Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra in search of work
 puure chunavi daur main unka gussa is kadar badha hua tha ki hafton tak dadhi nahin banaai or gaahe-bagaahe ve apni bahen chadhaate hue dekhe gaye
 In his anger, he did such a thing, for which he was also criticized a lot
 unhone ek chunavi sabha main samaajawaadee party ke tathakthith ghoshnaatr ko faad diya tha
 On this performance of his anger, the supporters sitting in front also enjoyed clapping
 aakhir unke is gusse par sapa ke yuvaraj akhilesh yadav ko yah kah kar apni pratikriya deni padi ki koi rahul gandhi ko apane gusse par niyantran karnaa sikhaye, varanaa ve ek din stage se kud jaaenge
 Rahul Gandhi's anger subsided after the UP election results came out
 ve jab press conferes karne aae to unke andar wo gussa najar nahin aayaa

 It all started when Sunaina tweeted on Twitter that she fully supports Kangana Ranaut

 Now Kangana has finally spoken to the media about this

 Kangana Ranaut broke her silence about Sunaina's case while talking to the Spotboy website
 jab unase poocha gaya ki unhone sunaina kii madad kaise kii to unhone jawaab main kaha, 'unka parivaar unka dhyaan rakh rahaa he, to main unhen shubhakamanaayen dena chaahati hum
 When Kangana was asked if Sunaina had asked her for help, she said, "yes, he did talk to me
" wo abhi apane parivaar ke saath hai or wo log unka khyaal rakh rahe hai
 'see this post on Instagram # kanganaranaut questioned about # sunainaroshan and this is what she said In the interview, Kangana told about talking to Ranaut
 unhone kaha tha, 'maine haal hi main kangana se madad maangi he, kyonki wo mahila shashaktikaran ko badhaava detii hai or unka netritv karti hai
 i support the power of women and i support Kangana today
 kangana ek mahila hai or unhen madad maangane kaa haq he or mujhe bhi he
 They want justice and me too
 mujhe nahin pataa ki unke or mere bhai (ruthik roshan) ke bich kya hua, par main ye jaanati hum ki bina aag ke dhuaan nahin uth saktaa
 "me and Kangana were friends first and then we separated
 mujhe hameshaa se hi kangana pasand thim, lekin do saal pehle jab unhone neshnal award jeeta to maine unhen massej kiya, to unhone mujhe kaha ki tumhaare parivaar ke kaaran ab tum mujhase dosti mat rakho or baatcheet mat karo
 i started thinking about what was going on because i had no idea about anything at that time
 kisi ne mujhe kuch nahin bataaya tha
 After this, my family told me what is going on and if my brother has proof of this, then tell him to bring the truth to everyone

 is maamle main ghir chuke dudi ne rathore or grih mantri kataaria ko yaad dilaayaa ki donon netaa farji encounter main shaamil rahe hai
 Significantly, Rathore has been acquitted in the fake encounter case of Dara Singh and Kataria in Sohrabuddin's encounter case
 rathore ke bari hone ke aadesh ko rajasthan hycourt ne palat diya tha, lekin supreme court ne hycourt ke aadesh par ste laga diya
 The case again reached the Supreme Court this month, but a judge disassociated himself from the case and it was now referred to another bench
 soharabuddin encounter maamla bhi phir charchaa main aa gaya he
 However, Doody does not stop here
 vah dhamkee bhare andaaj main kehete hai ki ve bhaajapa ke us netaa ke naam kaa khulaasa kar denge, jiskaa rajput mafia anandapal singh ke encounter main haath he
 Due to this encounter, the BJP is losing Rajput votes
 dudi ne aarope lagaaya ki unke khilaaf jo video viral hua he, vah unke ek press conference or uske baad patrakaron se anaupchaarik baatcheet ke kareeb 45 minute ke video se kaat kar or chhedchhad kar taiyaar kiya gaya he
 He said in his defense, "I am an ordinary farmer and do not know anything about whether money can be put in the speculative market
 ’’haalanki, ek chaunkaane vaala kadam uthaate hue ve donon rathore netaaon ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar prastaav lekar aae
 It was also accepted by Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Kailash Meghwal and referred the matter to the committee
 sattarudh bhaajapa isse achambhit he
 Minister Rathore even threatened Doody to withdraw it, but on Doody's complaint, the speaker warned Rathore to keep restraint
 iske baad rathore ne video recording ko sadan ke saamne rakhaa jisane ise visheshadhikaar samiti ko saunp diya
 He demanded that the truth be ascertained by conducting a forensic examination of the video
 visheshadhikaar prastaav ko aage badhaane ke dudi ke nirnay se aisa lagata he ki unhen koi dar nahin he
 However, BJP leaders say that by handing it over to the Privileges Committee, Doody himself has bought the trouble
 saarvajanik nirmaan vibhaag ke mantri younus khan ne india today se kaha ki is kadam se dudi ko nunnsaan hoga, kyonki video se yah saaf pataa chalata he ki ve sattebaaji main shaamil hai
 At present, both the parties are engaged in uprooting the dead issues
 dudi ne saaf kiya he ki ve farji encounter ko bada mudda banane se bilkul bhi nahin chukenge
 The BJP will now have to prove that Doody has invested money in the speculative market, which will probably not be easy
 abhi is prakaran main or bhi tadakaa lagane vaala he, aakhir taqatvar hote vipaksh ke netaa kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par jo lagi he
 *** agar aap padhate likhte hai, sochate vichaarte hai yaa aapke parivaar main koi noujvaan padhata likhata he, duniya ko dekhne samajhane ke liye alag-alag kitaaben padhata he, jise aas paas ke log intelexual kehete hai, to thodi saavdhaanee baratane main koi harj nahin he
 Never call yourself intellectual, or else you have become such a leader, who has become fond of killing the intellectual
 chune hue pratinidhi belgaum hote ja rahe hai
 They are saying to shoot anyone as if a sovereign order is being issued
 kabhi sena ko to kabhi aasthaa ko dhaal banaakar aisi baaten kahi ja rahi hai
 What kind of India are we making where the MLA, rather the MLA, says that if i were the Home Minister, i would have fired the Intellectuals who spoke against the Army
 kya unhen nahin pataa ki sena se ritair hone ke baad general se lekar brigadier or karnal tak sena par sawaal uthaate rahe hai
 Since when has it been done that the bullet will be blown away
 baswan gauda patil bijepi ke vidhayak hai
 Speaking on the Kargil Vijay Diwas in Vijayapura, Karnataka, he said that if he had been the Home Minister, he would have shot the person speaking against the army

 Janab has been a minister of state in the Vajpayee government
 aap dekhenge ki tarah tarah ke tarkon kaa sahaara lekar hatya ko uchit tahaarne kii koshish ho rahi he, uksaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Is there so much hate in today's India that there will be talk of being shot

 jab supreme court sainik or ardh sainik balon ke virodh ke baad bhi jaanch ke aadesh de saktaa he to phir baswan gauda kanoon kii kis samaj ke hisaab se saream goli maarane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Will it be spoken in this language now? manipur main kathith rup se phek encounter maamle main supreme court kah chukaa he ki bina kisi nyaayik prakriya ke sena yaa ardhsainik balon ko armd forces specianal power act ke naam par kisi kii hatya karne kii anumati nahin he
 Democracy will be put at risk by killing someone on suspicion or declaring an enemy of the state
 baswan gauda pehle bhi bayaan de chuke hai ki ve musalamaanon se vot nahin maangate hai, hinduon par puraa vishwaas he ki vot milegaa
 Is this not a statement dividing the country? aisi baaten lagaataar public spes main sahaj hoti ja rahi hai
 The crowd on the street is getting a hint that their violence has political support
 bas kisi ko maar kar sena or aasthaa kaa bahaanaa bana dena he
 Like there is no law for these two issues
 kya aap apane bacchon ko aisi bheed main bhejnaa chahenge jo kisi bhi bahaane kisi kii hatya ke liye taiyaar ho
 On July 27, the government said in the Supreme Court about the One Rank One Pension that it will not review its formula again

 The Supreme Court has asked the government to give a written reply to the petitioner within four weeks
 sena se hi ritair hue logon ke sanghathan ne supreme court kaa daravaaza khatkhataya he
 They say that the One Rank One Pension Scheme implemented by the government is not according to the recommendations of the Koshiyari Committee

 Retired soldiers and paramilitaries keep on demonstrating their demands
 haal hi main ardhsainik balon ke purv jawaano ne dilli main pension or vetan main barabari kii maang ko lekar pradarshan kiya tha

 Students are constantly tweeting the Railway Minister

 The Amritsar Center is lying kya itani dur centre dena zaruri tha
 a candidate from Katihar in Bihar said that his center was in Mohali
 vahaan se chandigarh ke liye hafte main ek din train jaati he
 If it will run four days before the exam, then you have to leave four days before or else you will have to change the train to reach Mohali, which will increase the cost katihaar se mohali kaa ek taraf kaa kiraaya 620 rupee he
 Return tickets are not available
 vahaan rahane kaa kharchaa alag hoga
 There is no confidence in the timing of the railways, so we have to leave two to three days in advance
 ye sab kharche or samay kaa hisaab railway recruitment board ne kyon nahin kiya
 Has it been done so that large number of students cannot reach and miss the exam
 aara se ek chaatr ne bataaya ki uskaa centre bhubaneshwar he
 He has to go to Howrah first, from there to Bhubaneswar
 vaapasi kaa tikat bhi lenaa he
 The cost of stay will be separate, the total cost will be 2000 to 3000

 If the Railway Minister cannot pay attention, then the Prime Minister should take notice of this immediately
 abhaya choudhary ne likhaa he ki patna ke chaatr kaa centre jabalpur padaa he
 2000 rupees will be spent on arrival
 baat kharch kii nahin he, kisi ko tikat nahin mil rahaa he
 Their condition will also deteriorate due to being loaded into General Bogie

 Sanjit Kumar has written that Sir Mera Center is situated in Sagaur of Madhya Pradesh

 Due to lack of money, i will not be able to reach the exam center
 kyonki bihar ke bhagalpur main rahane vaale vidhyaarthiyon kaa centre mohali de diya he
 Keep only 400 rupees straight, by sucking the blood of the poor
 sani singh ne twit kiya he ki sar aap bahut badhiya kaam kar rahe hai
 But what can this sir not give the exam in another state, cannot spend three thousand, my hard work and all my dreams will come back
 duusare rajya sar, nahin sambhav ho paaegaa
 Santosh Singh's tweet that honorable Railway Minister, how is this injustice done to the unemployed, first the cost of 500 and now 4000 to take the exam, the Minister does not have to return the money, hence 1500 km of the examination
 vaah mantri ji vaah
 The Minister of Railways and Ministry of Railways should take note of these students
 ye vaaki saadhaaran pariwaron ke bachche hai
 Some parents sell carts, and some parents sell golgappas in Calcutta
 aise pariwaron ke bacchon ko do se teen hazaar kharch kar apane zile se chennai janaa pade, mohali janaa pade, hyderabad janaa pade, thodi zyaadati he
 Sonbhad in UP is a very poor area
 yahaan ke chaatr kaa centre mohali padegaa to ve 1500 se 2000 kaa karch nahin uthaa sakenge
 When the exam is online, then what is the point of giving the center from here to there
 phir online kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Some boys have written that they have no money
 yaa to bihar ke mukhyamantri ko in sabhi chaatro ko 2-2 hazaar dena chahie yaa phir unhen bhi rail mantri se baat kerani chahie ki garib chaatro ke saath aise kyon ho rahaa he or aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 a student going to Hyderabad from Ara is costing 3000
 chaatr bahut massej kar rahe hai
 The examination is to begin from 9 August
 agar rajyon ke mukhyamantri rail mantri se baat kar in chaatro kaa kiraaya maaf karvaa den to main bilkul iskaa shrey nahin luungaa
 Rather, i will give credit to them only
 aap yakeen kiijie inhen dikkat na hoti to ye nahin likhte
 The examination of many students will be missed
 chaar-chaar saal lagaakar taiyaari kii he in logon ne
 Meanwhile, the strike of trucks has been going on since 20 July
 iske kaaran na maal uth rahaa he na kahin pahunch rahaa he
 The Society of Indian Automobiles has said that the supply of vehicles has been stopped due to the strike
 The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) ne hadtaal bulaai he
 They demand that tax on diesel be reduced, petrel and diesel be brought under the purview of GST
 sipiem or AIADMK ne bhi sarkaar se kaha he ki trek waalon se baat kar samaadhaan nikaala janaa chahie
 Because of the strike, the prices of things can go up and many small traders who are dependent on daily income can suffer a lot of damage
 balki ho hi rahaa he
 All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), claims that 93 lakh trucks are on indefinite strike
 trek oparator toll tex ke naam par avaidh vasuuli kaa bhi virodh kar rahe hai
 They say toll tax should also be reduced
 is hadtaal kaa elaan 17 may ko hi kar diya gaya tha
 According to their press release, the strike is 70-80 percent successful and this has caused a loss of Rs 30,000 crore to the industries
 sarkaar se kai baar baatcheet kii magar koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 The comments trek hadtaal se jude log ek massej viral kar rahe hai ki ek saptaah se hadtaal chal rahi he magar koi tivi media nahin dikhaa rahaa he
 Who did not show, who did not show, can not say with claims, but those who viral such messages should ask themselves a question
 ve news channelon par kya dekhte hai
 Who will win in Hindu Muslim Debate or in July of 2018 who will win in May of 2019
 is charchaa ko dekhne main uljhe rahete hai
 If they will see such programs, promote them, then how do they expect that when they go on strike, there will be journalism on the channel
 channel kya dikhaate hai is par unka bas nahin he magar is par to unka bas he ki ve ghar pahunch kar raat main yaa dopaher main channelon par kya dekhte hai
 What you see is journalism
 agar channel vaale patrakarita kar rahe hote to janata murga banakar apni maang uthaane ke liye majaboor nahin hoti
 These people say that the Food Corporation of India is not taking the final result by taking their exam, due to which they can join
 disambar main pariksha hui thi, march main riselt aa gaya
 These people are from Rajasthan and have been elected to the Gujarat region
 isi 11 farvari ko imtehaan hua tha
 Physical examination was also held on 15 and 16 April, but April to July passed but the final result is not coming out
 in naujavaanon se bhi puuchhie ki ve channelon par patrakarita dekhte hai yaa hindu muslim dibet dekhte hai
 i have had so many problems that i go out in denial all day because i cannot do all the story
 media kaa kaam he janata kii baat sarkaar tak pahunchaana lekin aap koi bhi channel khol kar dekhie
 What is going on there kab tak janata tivi main aane ke liye or akhbaar main chhapane ke liye bal mudayegi or murga banegi
 Basavan Gowda Patil is a BJP MLA
 karnataka ke vijaipura main kargil vijay diwas par bolte hue unhone kaha ki agar ve grahamantri hote to sena ke khilaaf bolne vaale ko goli se marava dete
 Think, what if he really would have been in place of Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 janaab vaajapeyi sarkaar main rajya mantri rah chuke hai
 You will see that by resorting to various arguments, an attempt is being made to justify murder, an attempt is being made to provoke
 kya aaj ke hindustan main intelexual se itani nafrat ho gai he ki goli se uda dene kii baat hogi
 Then the school college university should all be closed
 baswan gauda es patil ko pataa nahin hoga ki aaj hi 27 july ko supreme court main kya hua he
 Since 2016, 1528 cases of fake encounter are being heard by the security forces in Manipur
 sabhi encounter 2000 se 2012 ke bich ke hai, jisamen sena, assam rifles, manipur police par aarope he
 The Supreme Court has reprimanded the Chief of CBI for laxity in its investigation
 unase kaha he ki 30 july ko bataaen ki tezi laane ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he
 When the Supreme Court can order an investigation even after the opposition of the military and paramilitary forces, then Basavan Gowda is talking about shooting the public according to what understanding of the law
 kya ab is bhashaa main baat hogi
 In the alleged fake encounter case in Manipur, the Supreme Court has said that without any judicial process, the army or paramilitary forces are not allowed to kill anyone in the name of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act
 kisi ko shaq ke aadhaar par maar dene yaa rajya kaa dushman ghoshit kar dene se loktantr khatare main pad jayega
 Basavan Gowda has already given a statement that he does not ask for votes from Muslims, Hindus have full faith that votes will be obtained
 kya ye desh ko baantne vaala bayaan nahin he
 Such things are constantly getting comfortable in the public space
 sadak par bheed ko ishaara mil rahaa he ki unki hinsa kii karatuut ko raajnneetik samarthan hasil he
 Just kill someone and make an excuse for the army and faith
 jaise in do masalon ke liye kanoon he hi nahin
 Would you like to send your children to such a crowd who are ready to kill someone on any excuse
 27 july ko hi van rank van pension ko lekar sarkaar ne supreme court main kah diya ki vah apane formule kii dobaaraa samiksha nahin karegi
 Nothing that has been done cannot be done because it will increase financial pressure
 supreme court ne sarkaar se kaha he ki chaar hafte ke bheetar yachikakarta ko likhit rup main jawaab de
 The organization of people who have retired from the army has approached the Supreme Court
 inkaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne jo van rank van pension yojana lagu he wo koshiyaari cameti ke sujhaavon ke anusaar nahin he
 Koshiyari is also a member of BJP
 sevanivruth sainik or ardhsainik apni maangon ko lekar pradarshan karte rahete hai
 Recently, former paramilitary personnel had demonstrated in Delhi demanding pension and salary parity
 van rank van pension kii maang kii
 Why does Basavan Gowda Patil not fight it? inke naam par kisi ko goli maar dene kii baat kar sakate hai to inaki maangon ke samarthan karne se kya pardaa he
 Hari Om Pandey is MP from Ambedkaranagar in UP

 He is going to complete five years as an MP, also know what he has experienced about the country's problem
 saasand ji balaatkaar ke kaarnon kaa vishleshan kar rahe hai

 At present, more than 47 lakh students appearing for railway exams are in a tizzy

 When the admit card was downloaded four days ago, the students sensed that the center of the examination was given 1000 to 1500 km away
 bihar ke katihaar ke chaatro ko mohali janaa hoga, aara ke chaatro ko bhubaneshwar or hyderabad janaa hoga or baxur ke chaatro ko chennai janaa hoga
 You might think this is normal, wait a bit
 rail mantri ko chaatr lagaataar twit kar rahe hai
 In which we are saying that i am a student of Rajasthan
 amritsar centre pad gaya he
 Was it necessary to give the center so far? bihar ke katihaar se ek parikshaarthi ne bataaya ki uskaa centre mohali padaa he
 From there one trains a day to Chandigarh
 agar pariksha se chaar din pehle chalegi to chaar din pehle nikalnaa hoga yaa phir train badal badal kar mohali pahunchnaa hoga, jiskaa kharchaa bad jayega
 One way fare from Katihar to Mohali is Rs 620
 vaapasi kaa tikat nahin mil rahaa he
 The cost of living there will be different
 railway kii timming kaa bharosa nahin isliye do teen din pehle nikalnaa hoga
 Why did the Railway Recruitment Board not calculate all these expenses and time? kya isliye kiya gaya he taaki badi sankhya main chaatr pahunch hi na saken or pariksha chhot jaae
 a student from Ara told that his center is Bhubaneswar
 use pehle haavda janaa hoga, vahaan se bhubaneshwar
 Return tickets also have to be taken
 thaharne kaa kharchaa alag, kul milakar 2000 se 3000 kaa kharchaa aa jayega
 Anshu has tagged the Railway Minister and wrote that Sir i am a student of Bihar

 The cost of commuting is 1500 only
 ye sabhi chaatr general main safar karne vaale hai
 Boys of ordinary homes are girls
 1500-2000 kimi duuri par imtehaan ke centre dene kaa kya matlab he
 There is an outcry among the railway examinees
 rail mantri dhyaan nahin de sakate to pradhanmantri ko turant is baat kaa notice lenaa chahie
 Abhay Chaudhary has written that the Patna student center is lying in Jabalpur
 aane jane main hi 2000 rupee kharch ho jaaenge
 It is not spent, nobody is getting tickets
 general bogi main ladaa fada kar jane se inaki sthiti bhi bigadegi
 How will they test? sanjit kumaar ne likhaa he ki sar meraa centre madhya pradesh ke sagaur padaa he
 Only one train leaves from Bihar 13423 that too once a week
 kam se kam meri pariksha kii taarikh to uske hisaab se ho
 Mani Ratnam Tiwari tweeted not to cheat students

 Sunny Singh has tweeted that sir you are doing a great job

 Other states will not be possible, sir

 Wow Minister! rail mantri or rail mantralay ko in chaatro kii baat par dhyaan dena chahie
 They are truly children of ordinary families
 kisi ke maa baap thela chalaate hai to kisi ke maa baap kalakatta main golgappa bechate hai
 Children of such families have to spend two to three thousand to go to Chennai from their district, go to Mohali, go to Hyderabad, a little more
 upi kaa sonbhadd behad garib ilaaka he
 If the center of the student here is in Mohali, then they will not be able to spend 1500 to 2000
 jab pariksha online ho rahi he tab phir idhar se udhar centre dene kaa kya matlab he
 Then what is the meaning of online
 kuch ladakon ne to likhaa he ki unke paas paise nahin he
 Either the Chief Minister of Bihar should give 2-2 thousand to all these students or they should also talk to the Railway Minister about why this is happening to poor students and how it can happen
 ek chaatr aara se hyderabad ja rahaa he use 3000 kaa kharch aa rahaa he
 Students are messaging a lot
 9 agast se pariksha shuru honi he
 If the Chief Minister of the states talks to the Railway Minister and waives the fare of these students, then i will not take credit for it at all
 balki main iskaa shrey unheen ko duungaa
 If you believe it was not a problem, then it would not be written
 bahut se chaatro kaa imtahaan chhot jayega

 Due to this neither the goods are lifting nor reaching anywhere
 sosayadi of indian automobil ne kaha he ki hadtaal ke kaaran gadiyon kii supplai band ho gai he
 The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has called the strike
 inaki maang he ki dijal par tex kii kami kii jaae, petril or deazal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 CPM and AIADMK have also told the government that a solution should be found by talking to the truckers
 kyonki hadtaal ke kaaran chizon ke daam bad sakate hai or kai chote mote vyapaaree jo rose ke aamad par nirbhar hote hai, unhen kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Rather it is happening
 All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), kaa daawa he ki 93 lakh trek anischitkaaleen hadtaal par hai
 Truck operators are also opposing the illegal collection in the name of toll tax
 unka kahana he toll tex kam bhi kiya janaa chahie
 The strike was announced on 17 May itself
 inaki press relies ke anusaar hadtaal 70-80 fisadi safal he or isse udyogon ko 30,000 karod kaa ghaataa ho chukaa he
 Talks with the government many times but no result has come
 tippaniyan People associated with the truck strike are making a message that the strike has been going on for a week but no television media is showing it
 kisne dikhaaya kisne nahin dikhaaya is par daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa magar aise massej viral karne waalon ko ek sawaal khud se poochna chahie
 What they watch on news channels
 hindu muslim dibet main mazaa aata he yaa 2018 ke july main 2019 kii may main koun jitegaa
 They are busy watching this discussion
 agar ve aise kaaryakramon ko dekhenge, badhaava denge to phir kaise ummid karte he ki jab ve hadtaal par jaaenge to channel par patrakarita hone lagegi
 They do not have a bus on what the channels show, but on this, they only have access to what they see on the channels at night or in the afternoon
 jo dekhte hai kya wo patrakarita he
 If the channeled journalists were doing journalism, then the public would not have been forced to raise their demand by being cocky
 in logon kaa kahana he ki food corporation of india unki pariksha lekar antim parinaam nahin nikaal rahaa he, jiske kaaran unki jwining ho sake
 The examination was held in December, the result came in March
 ye log rajasthan ke hai or gujarat rigen ke liye chune gaye hai
 Imtehan took place on this 11 February
 15 or 16 april ko shaareerik pariksha bhi ho gai, lekin april se july biit gaya magar final riselt nahin nikal rahaa he
 Also ask these youngsters whether they watch journalism on the channels or Hindu Muslim debates
 mere paas itani samasyaayein aa gayi hai ki din bhar manaa karne main nikal jaataa he kyonki main sabhi story kar hi nahin saktaa
 The job of the media is to bring the matter of the public to the government, but open any channel
 vahaan kya chal rahaa he
 By when will the public turn their hair and make cock for appearing in TV and appearing in newspaper
