Remembering her days, her elder sister, Shaheen, 26, says, "when that little girl said this Somebody in the family was not surprised at his faith speaking, as people at his home in Juhu saw how Alia used to act in talk

 Bollywood does not consider him a star simply because of the box office collection
 karan johar apane sho kaaphi vid karan main yah kehane se khud ko roak nahin pate ki ‘‘camere ke saamne kirdaar ko jeene kii jo kshamta unamem he, vah kisi or main nahin
 Abhishek Varman, director of 2 States, says, "they know very well what they want
" student of da year ke baad unki jo chhavi bani, ve use toduya chaahati hai or apni bahumukhi pratibha ko sabit karne ke liye chunauteepurn role le rahi hai
 In her debut film, Alia was in the same role as her personality as an attractive girl in college wearing short dresses and carrying designer bags in her hand
 lekin imtiyaaj ali kii hive main li se hatakar kirdaar tha jise aalia ne khud ko aparankartaaon ke changul main fansi bholi-bhali or duniya kii buraaiyon se anjaan veeraa main dhalkar utani hi khubsuurati or sahajata se nibhaayaa he
 In a scene in the film that has no dialogue, Aaliyah suddenly sinks in tears
 yah bhavuk seen imtiyaaj or aalia donon ko behad pasand he
 "it was a life-changing experience," says Alia
 ’’ beshak is film ne box offis par sirf 28

 She says, "shooting at a location with no facilities, sleeping in a train and running without hot water were such experiences that changed her life completely
" use ehsaas hua ki acting ke prati uske lagaav kii vajah glamer nahin he
 There are many such scenes in the film when she cried
 unamem kahin banaavat nahin thi, mujhe pataa he meri bahan ke aansu asli the
 Varman did not need to see the highway to know Alia's talent and her abilities
 student of da year film main assistant diarector ke taur par kaam karte hue unhone set par aalia ko dekha tha
 He was convinced that Alia is perfect for Ananya, the Tamil heroine of Chetan Bhagat's novel 2 States: The Story of My Marriage
 yah aadhunik prem or paariwarik mulyon ke bich pisati iiem graduate kii kahani he
 Alia was far ahead of Varman in trusting Alia in playing her role

 In addition to her prudence to choose a project, she trusts Karan's approach
 ve dharma film ke saath hampti sharma kii dulahaniya kar rahi hai jisamen ek baar phir ve student of da year ke apane ko-star varun dhawan ke saath hongi
 He is often compared to Kareena Kapoor Khan
 unheen kii tarah ve bhi mumbai ke jamanabai narsi skool se padhi hai
 She has not taken any formal training in acting and despite her journey in three films, she is far younger than her closest rivals, Parineeti Chopra, 25, and Shraddha Kapoor, 26
 aalia ne apane pradarshan se sabit kiya he ki ve is industry main lambey arase tak tikne vaali hai
 Three successful films have given her the opportunity to talk about her future with the same confidence she used to say in childhood
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki koi itani bebaaki se kahegaa lekin mujhe vaaki lagata he ki main kuch khaas karne or khaas banane ke liye ai hum
 "this is an unambiguous statement from the tongue of a member of the family where there is no dearth of talent
" aalia ke pita lekhak, diarector or produsar mahesh bhatta bhi aise hi bebaak hai
 Mother Soni Razdan is also an artist and half-sister Pooja is also an actor and director
 actor imran hashmi or diarector mohit suri or vishesh bhatta unke rishte main unke bhai hai
 But despite being from the film family, Mahesh Bhatt kept Alia and Shaheen away from this environment
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘is samay vah behtareen dhang se apane jivan ko aage badha rahi he
 She is like a gift in our life
 hamen use dekhakar hairat hoti he
 Whatever he is, he is on his own
 ’’tarifon kaa silsilaa donon ore se he
 Alia says, "I am proud of my father
 ve eemaandaar or saaf bolne vaale insaan hai
 "she often goes to his house to enjoy the biryani made by step mother Kiran
" ‘‘hamaare ghar main acha or swasth maahaul he
 Alia is the closest to Shaheen in her family
 ve unki raajadaar hai
 Every year both of them holiday together in London
 aalia kahati hai, ‘‘ham alag nahin ho sakate
 i may not share all the things with her, but she knows the most about me
 ’’shaheen kii jimmedaari yah dhyaan rakhane kii he ki aalia ke paanv jameen par hi rahen
 Shaheen says, "this industry is just a face
" ek alag vyakti main badal janaa aasaan he
 i always tell her to remember what you are and not to stray from her
 ’’aalia instagram par apni selfies post kar apni vaastavik jhalak dikhalaati rahati hai jinamein ve kabhi apane doston to kabhi apni billiyon pika or shiba ke saath najar aati hai
 Sometimes the glare of fame and success also passes heavily as Alia experienced on appearing twice on the Coffee with Karan show, in which she was laughed off at answering Karan's general knowledge questions
 yahaan tak ki karan ne apane duusare mehmaanon se general nolej ke sawaalon par galati karne par unhen ‘‘abhi aapane aalia kii tarah jawaab diya’’ kah diya
 But she does not mind it at all and cites a line from her favorite TV show Friends, "I started a new way
" ’’public life main to yah sab chalata rahata he
 But as long as she will win the audience's heart with her performance on screen and keep entertaining her, she does not need to worry much

 RJD says that when TDP can leave the Narendra Modi government if Andhra Pradesh does not get special state status then why can't Nitish Kumar do it? Tejashwi says that when there is only one government in Delhi and Bihar, Nitish Kumar Who are demanding special state status

 India vs Australia
 
 
 sharajah
 
 
 coca-cola Cup
 match number 6
 Australia batting first scored a mountainous score of 284 runs
 bharat ko final main jane ke liye jarurat thi, jeet kii
 But then there was a sandstorm in Sharjah and the score was reduced
 lekin jab tufaan rukaa to maidan ke andar ek tufaan aayaa, jisane puri australia team ko uda diya or itihaas main apana naam darj karvaa diya
 The name of this storm was Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar
 saurav ganguli ke saath opening karne utre sachin ne maano man main kuch thaan rakhaa ho
 The way he started playing Australian bowlers was seen in the angry batting
 sachin ne lagaataar shen warn, casproviz, steve wa, tom mudi kisi ko nahin bakhsha
 And moving forward hit sixes
 bharat ye match haar gaya tha, lekin net ran rate ke dam par final main jagah bana lee thi
 Two days later, when the final took place, it was such a scene again
 final main bhi sachin ne 134 ranon kii pari kheli or isi tarah australian gendbaajon kii dhajjiyaan uda di
 Sixes of Sachin, the voice of Tony Greig and Sharjah
 sachin kii in donon pariyon ko sharajah storm kaa naam diya gaya, yani sharajah main sachin kaa tufaan
 In Sachin Tendulkar's career of nearly 25 years, there were no such moments or innings that would separate him from other players, these two innings were also one of them
 15 november, 1989 ko jab karachi main 16 saal kaa baccha pakistan ke khoonkhaar gendbaajon ke aage ballebaaji karne utraa
 So no one thought that this child will be called 'god of Cricket'
 master blaster, god of cricket, tendalya naa jane kitne naam hai sachin ke
 It was Sachin who lived the hopes of Indian fans on his shoulder for almost 25 years and almost met those expectations every time
 sachin ne is desh main cricket dekhne ke najariye / tareeke ko badal diya
 Because in the 90s when Sachin was at his peak, TV in India opened with Sachin batting and closed after his dismissal
 sachin ke liye lakhon log upwas rakhte the, purv bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni bhi kah chuke hai ki wo kahkar rahete the ki jab sachin batting karne aae to mere ko uthaa dena
 It was Sachin, who did not know how many children became Sachin in the country because their parents love Sachin
 sachin ek tej gendbaaj bananaa chaahate the, lekin kismat ne ballebaaj bana diya
 And the batsmen also made all the records of the cricket world in their names
 sachin apane shuruaati kariyar main neeche ballebaaji karne aate the, lekin 1994 main tatkaaleen captain mohammad ajaharuddin ke ek faisle ne sachin kii ballebaaji ko puri tarah se badal diya or shaayad bhartiya vanade cricket ko bhi
 The day of 27 March 1994 proved to be a historic day for cricket
 vanade kariyar ke 70wein match main sachin ko opening mauka mila, jiskaa unhone bharpoor phayda uthaaya or ek ke baad ek kirtiman apane naam karte gaye
 During the 1994 tour of New Zealand, Team India regular opener Navjot Singh Sidhu started Sachin's innings due to a neck problem
 sachin bhi yahi chaahate the, iske liye ve captain ajaharuddin or manager ajit wadekar se apil bhi kar chuke the
 In this match, Sachin hit 82 runs in 49 balls
 bataur openar sachin ne kai kirtiman sthapit kiye
 
 
 # As the opener, Sachin 48 in 344 matches
 29 kii ausat se sarvaadhik 15310 ran banaae
 # He scored 3116 runs in 119 matches at an average of 33
 # sachin ke vanade kariyar ke kul 49 main se 45 shatak opening karte hue aae
 His first ODI century came in the 79th match, he also opening
 sachin ke naam naa jane kitne record darj hai
 He holds the record for most runs and centuries in ODI, Test cricket and international cricket
 jo shaayad atoot hi lagata he
 Sachin's career and track record
 
 
 # 200 test match, 15921 ran
 51 centuries, 68 half-centuries
 ausat 53
 78 # Around 13,492 runs while batting at number four
 ausat 44
 83 # 463 ODI Match, 18426 runs
 49 shatak, 96 ardhashatak
 # 2278 runs, only in the World Cup
 2003 worldcup main sabase zyada 673 ran
 # The highest number of 3077 runs against Australia in odis, followed by Sri Lanka 3133 runs
 # vanade main 200 ran banane vaale pehle ballebaaj
 # 62 times Man of the Match Award
 # 15 baar main of da series kaa aword
 # Most 9 centuries against Australia
 # 7 baar ek hi saal main 1000 se zyada ran
 It has been almost 5 years since Sachin Tendulkar retired from cricket
 lekin in paanch main saal main naa cricket sachin se dur gaya or naa hi phens
 Even today, if Sachin stands up or gets a glimpse of him, then the voice of sachin-sachin resonates
 sachin abhi bhi ipel main mumbai indiens ke saath bataur menter jude hue hai
 There is always a discussion in today's time, will anyone be able to break Sachin's record
 is kadi main sabase zyada naam aata he bhartiya captain viraat kohli kaa
 The way Virat's career has been so far and the number of runs and centuries he has scored, may even break Virat Sachin's record
 agar aisa hota he to koi chaunkaane vaali baat nahin hogi, ek baar sachin ne khud kaha tha ki rohit sharma or viraat kohli aise ballebaaj hai jo unke record tod sakate hai
 But it is also true that any batsman can break Sachin's record only in statistics
 1989 se 2013 tak jis tarah sachin ne apane kariyar ko jiya or in saalon main jis tarah har bhartiya cricket fain ke dil main wo hameshaa ummid kii kiran rahe
 Perhaps no other cricketer will be able to do that thing
 sachin tendulkar ke jitna lanbaa kariyar aaj ke samay main sambhav nahin he or naa hi sachin jaisaa jajba kisi main dikhataa he
 Sachin spent many years of his career in injury but insistence on playing was such that he fought again and came back again
 ballebaaj aaenge, jaaenge, record banenge, tootenge
 But Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar will remain the same
 isliye sachin ramesh tendulkar, na bhuto-na bhavishyati
 Happy birthday Sachin Tendulkar
 sachin

 ( is shor ko aap bhi mahasoos kar sakate hai) No initiative was taken in the direction of government formation in Karnataka on Wednesday, as the state BJP is awaiting the approval of the central leadership to stake claim to form an alternative government in the state
 karnataka main vaikalpik sarkaar kii jarurat isliye padi he kyonki congress-jades gathbandhan sarkaar (karnataka Government)vidhansabha main vishwaas mat hasil nahin kar pai
 Even after two days have passed, the BJP is yet to stake any claim to form the government
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki vishwaas mat par voting ke liye jaldbaaji karne vaali bhaajapa ne abhi tak sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kyon nahin kiya?kumaraswami sarkaar girane ke baad rajya main bhaajapa ke sabase bade netaa or teen baar mukhyamantri rahe yediurppa ko ek baar phir siem pad kii jimmedaari milane kii sambhaavna jataai gai thi
 But the question here is that Yeddyurappa has passed 75 years, will the BJP still give him the responsibility of CM? Because BJP says that it does not give any responsibility to a leader above 75 years of age
 to kahin yediurppa kii umr hi to bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane main roda nahin ban rahi he?guuruuvaar ko karnataka bhaajapa ke netaa jagadish shettigar, basavaraj baummai or arvind limbawali bhaajapa rashtriya party adhyaksh amit shah se milane unke ghar pahunche
 After this, Karnataka BJP leader GM Parameshwara said that abhi hamaare paas 105 vidhayak hai
 The matter is also in court, the speaker has also not decided
 sarkaar der saber 100 fisadi ham hi banaaenge
 BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa had said after the fall of the congress-jds government in the trust vote that he would meet the party leadership, then go to meet the governor
 vishwaas mat ke dauraan bhaajapa ke paksh main 105 or kumaraswami kii sarkaar ke paksh main 99 vot pade the
 After this, Kumaraswamy resigned as Chief Minister
 vidhansabha main vishwasamat haarane ke baad mangalvaar ko congress-jad (es) kii 14 maah puraani sarkaar gir gai thi
 After this, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy resigned
 vidhansabha main shakti pareekshan main kumaraswami ko bhaajapa ke 105 maton ke mukaable 99 vot hi mili
 Karnataka BJP president BS Yeddyurappa said he was waiting for instructions from the party's central leadership to stake claim to form an alternative government in the state
 yediurppa ne apane pradesh mukhyalay ‘keshav krupa' main aresas netaaon se mulaakaat ke baad patrakaron se kaha tha, ‘main dilli se nirdeshon kaa intjaar kar rahaa hum
 i can call a Legislature Party meeting at any time and go to the Raj Bhavan (to present a claim)
 main iske liye intjaar kar rahaa hum
 ' china main 8 varshon main pehali baar internet cafe kii sankhya main kami dekhi gai

 The second day of Sahitya Aaj Tak started with Chhath song, the biggest Mahakumbh of many Bhojpuri songs sung by the BJP leader Manoj Tiwari from the stage 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' has started on Friday (november 1)
 kaarykram kaa aaj doosraa din he
 On the 'halla Bol' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on the second day, 'sudhish Pachauri (writer), Sachchidanand Joshi (member secretary, Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts) and Anant Vijay (writer, critic) gave their opinion in the' literature of ideology 'session
 
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak ke agjicutive editor rohit sardana ne kiya
 During this discussion, all the three guests kept their words calmly
 charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue rohit ne kaha vichaardhaara sahitya ko banaati he yaa sahitya vichaardhaara ko banaati he
 Both strengthen or weaken each other, who casts a shadow on both of them, and which of the two leads or pulls them forward, all these questions will be discussed
 marxvaadiyon ne is desh main sahitya kaa kabada kar diyacharchaa ke dauraan lekhak evam aalochak anant vijay ne kaha ki khunta bahut chota shabd he darasal marxvad kaa khambha gada hua he
 That pillar has been held by people who think that everything will end once they get away from the pillar
 marxvad ke log aise hai jinke rachanaaon main kuch or hota he, ye kehete kuch or hai or karte kuch or hai
 It can be argued that a person can have an ideology from what his creation is, as he may be characterless but portrays a hero with a very good character in his works
 lekin jab aap aisi baaten karte ho to samaaj main aapako manyata nahin milti
 Even by spreading false illusions, you get recognition, it does not last long
 darasal vichaardhaara kii dikkat yah hui, vichaardhaara ke bare main jab ham bhartiya sandarbh main baat karte hai main thodaa khulkar bolta hum isliye bahut saare akraman bhi jhelta hum, marxvaadiyon ne is desh main sahitya kaa kabada kar diya
 Not only literature but social and economic writing was stopped
 pragati prakaashan kii kitaaben yahaan khub bikne lageen
 They started selling so much that they disrupted the Indian ideology
 iske peeche bharat sarkaar or rus kii sarkaar kaa sanyukt prayaas tha
 Evidence has also started to be found
 saare dastavej agar aap dekhen to kai pramaan hai ki marxvad ko yahaan failaane or marxvad ko neeche tak le jane ke liye un logon ne bahut hi sangathit prayaas kiya
 The result of that effort was that in the universities of India, especially in the Hindi department, those who are associated with literature, you can go and see that people have not just put the leftist badge in them

 Marxists these days are engaged in the work of being child volunteers, while telling an anecdote, he further said that Pachauri Ji made Narendra Kohli a member of the People's Writers Association and appointed the convenor of somewhere
 ab kahaan kohli ji or kahaan janawaad lekin kohli ji se jab inhone kaha to unhone tark diya ki ram se bada janavaadee koun tha ye bataa do wo to jangal main 14 saal rahe
 Stayed among tribals
 uske baad in par dabaav aae inke tamaam mitron ne in par dabaav daalaa ki kohli ji ko hataa do
 What happened was that a writer like Kohli ji had to leave Pachauri ji out of the People's Writers Association
 sthiti yah he ki ek lekhak ko isliye nikaala gaya kyonki vah marks kii jagah ram kii baat karata he, vah bhartiyata kii maala japta he, vah rus kii taraf nahin dekhtaa he
 In his creations the soil of reality does not break that much
 ye jo asprishyata kaa bhav failaayaa marxvaadiyon ne usne bhartiya sahitya kaa bahut nuksaan kiya
 Especially in Hindi, if they used to walk on ideology, it was fine, but i say this again and again that it was the biggest mistake of the Marxists to make the ideology stream and persecute all the other writers in the stream and The situation today is that all the Marxists are now engaged in child labor
 gopal kanda kii tarah hi tamaam marxvaadi lekhak bal swayamsevak or shishu swayamsevak banane main lage hai
 This is a deviation of ideology
 aap isse samaj sakate hai ki yah vichaardhaara swaarth par aadhaarit he or iskaa vichaaron se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Marxists committed literary corruption, Anant Vijay said that not only did the Marxists prevent other writers from publishing, they not only spread ideological terrorism but also did all literary corruption
 jo pragatisheel shabd he, ghotaalaa vahiin he
 Without capital you cannot be a Marxist writer
 daaru or murga kaa jod marxvaadi lekhak banaata he
 Conservatives have become stilted
 jo paramparawaadi hote hai darasal wo pragatisheel hote hai jabaki jo khud ko pragatisheel bataate hai wo paramparawaadi hote hai, wo badalanaa hi nahin chaahate, wo khunte se alag hona hi nahin chaahate
 They want to look straight like a gig horse
 vichaardhaara koi buree nahin hoti
 Ideological people are corrupt

 Salman Khankbirto, who arrived in Manali for the shoot of 'tubelight', might even forget about everything and take a decision to work further, but if Salman gets angry, he will definitely not work with Kabir
 jab kabir se is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, yah khabar galat he
 Common friends of both believe the same
 wo kehete hai, donon ke bich 'bajrangi bhaijan' ke samay bhi matbhed tha lekin film ne 300 karod rupee kamaaye or donon ab 'tubalite' main bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 We also wish that everything is fine between the two because in future we want to see the pair of the two again

 tejasvi ne kaha ki thakur kaa ek saal kaa phone kol detail saarvajanik kiya janaa chahie, jisase safedposh bhi benakaab ho saken
 He also asked that innocent girls were being raped for months, so what was the social welfare and police department doing? The Leader of Opposition said that the case should be investigated by the CBI under the supervision of the High Court

 Promises that remain promises
 
 During the last assembly election, BJP had promised farmers in Chhattisgarh to increase the support price of paddy from Rs 1200 per quintal to Rs 2100 per quintal
 iske alaava prati quintal bonus bhi 270 rupee se badhaakar 300 rupee karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa gaya tha

 har taraf ye sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya in darindon ko sajaa dene ke liye kanoon ko or zyada kadaa karne par, us par sakhti se paalan kii jarurat nahin he? kanoon ke tahat samuhik balaatkaar ke liye adhiktam sajaa umrakaid he, lekin iske baavjood sajaa kaa koi dar nahin he
 Every 22nd minute in the country and every 18th minute in Delhi, a girl or woman is raped
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya ab vakt aa gaya he ki balaatkaar ke liye faansee kii sajaa honi chahie? Many women's organizations fear that the provision of capital punishment for rape will increase the risk to the victim's life, as the accused will try to kill the victim to erase evidence
 desh main ek-chauthai rape ke maamalon main hi sajaa ho paati he or sajaa kii dar 26 fisadi he
 Pakistani terrorist Kasab was hanged this year in the Mumbai attack case after Dhananjay Chatterjee was hanged in 2004 for murdering a minor after he was raped
 faansee kii sajaa kii prakriya ko tej karne kii zarurat he
 300 convicts are in the queue to be hanged
 mangalvaar ko dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne dilli hycourt se is maamle main fast trek court banane kii apil kii, lekin iske liye zyada jajon kii jarurat he
 However, the chairperson of the Women's Commission Mamta Sharma says that the rapists should be given life imprisonment, so that they realize death every day
 tippaniyan On October 13, 2012, the Supreme Court had said on rape, that the trial and the High Court should not take this cowardly crime lightly and punish the harshest possible accused who had also killed the victim
 saath hi, sabooton ko aankane main zyada saavdhaanee barti jaae or aaropee ko kamjor tathyon par aaazaad na kiya jaae
 On molestation, the Supreme Court said on November 30, 2012, that molestation cases could be stopped with little effort and if it was not stopped, the consequences would be terrible
 vaise isi satr main sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ek bill pesh kar rakhaa he, jisamen yon hamalon ke liye kadi sajaaon kii baat he
 This is the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 2012, which if passed, will carry a minimum sentence of seven years for sexual assaults
 agar iske liye koi police yaa sarkari afasar yaa apni haisiyat kaa istemaal kar rahaa koi manager yaa adhikari jimmedaar paaya jaataa he, to use kam se kam 10 saal kii bamashkkat kaid se lekar umrakaid tak ho sakati he
 The purpose of this bill is to amend the IPC, CRPC, 1973 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
 desh main har 22wein minute main or dilli main har 18wein minute main kisi ladki yaa mahila ke saath balaatkaar hota he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the time has come that there should be a death sentence for rape? kai mahila sanghathanon ko ashanka he ki rape ke liye faansee kii sajaa ke praavdhaan se peedit kii jaan par khatra bad jayega, kyonki mulgim saboot mitaane ke liye peedit kii hatya kii koshish karegaa
 In the country only one-fourth of the rape cases are punishable and the conviction rate is 26 percent
 ek naaballig ke saath balaatkaar ke baad uski hatya ke maamle main dhananjay chatarji ko 2004 main faansee ke baad is saal pakistani aatankwaadi kasaab ko mumbai hamale ke maamle main faansee di gai
 There is a need to speed up the execution of the sentence
 300 sajaa paae apradhi faansee chadaaye jane kii qatari main hai
 On Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit appealed to the Delhi High Court to set up a fast track court in this case, but more judges are needed for this
 haalanki mahila ayog kii adhyaksh mamata sharma kaa kahana he ki balaatkaariyon ko umrakaid kii sajaa di jaae, taaki unhen har roj maut kaa ahsaas ho
 The comments 13 oktober, 2012 ko supreme court ne balaatkaar par kaha tha ki trial or hoicourt is kyrana aparaadh ko halke main na len or us aaropee ko sakht se sakht sajaa de, jisane peedit kii hatya bhi kar di ho
 Also, more care should be taken in assessing the evidence and the accused should not be freed on weak facts
 chhedhkhani par supreme court ne kaha 30 november, 2012 ko kaha tha ki chhedchhad ke maamalon ko thode prayaas se roka ja saktaa he or agar isko roka nahin gaya, to iske parinaam bhayankar honge
 However, in this session, the government has introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha, which calls for severe punishment for sexual assaults
 yah criminal lau amendament bill, 2012 he, jo paas hua to yon hamalon ke liye kam se kam saat saal kii sajaa hogi

 By the way, the defending champion India has a very good record against Bangladesh and has won 29 matches so far
 ek match parinaam rahit rahaa he, jabaki ek match bina khele radd ho gaya
 In the three matches that India has lost against Bangladesh, the World Cup-2007 defeat was particularly annoying as the Indian team had to be eliminated from the group stage of the World Cup after suffering the loss
 bharat ne haalanki agle hi world cap-2011 main us haar kaa badla le liya tha
 In the 2007 World Cup, in the Group b match at Queens Park Oval in Trinidad, the Indian team won the toss and decided to bat first, but none of the top batsmen, except opener Saurabh Ganguly (66) and Yuvraj Singh (47), walked
 Could not 49 and the whole team
 3 overon main 191 ran banaakar dharashayi ho gai thi
 At that time, Rahul Dravid was in command of the team, although Dravid could also contribute only 14 runs
 maujuuda captain mahendra singh dhoni us match main wicketiper ke rup main shaamil the or bina khaataa khole pavilion laut gaye the
 Bangladesh's current team captain Mashrafe Mortaza took four wickets in that match
 bharat se mili 192 ranon ke maamuli lakshya kaa peechha karte hue bangladesh ne tameem ikbaal (51), mushafikur rahim (naabad 56) or shaakib al hasan (53) kii ardhashtakeey pariyon kii badaulat 48
 Won five wickets in 3 overs
 iske baad haalanki bharat ne agle hi vishwa cap main is haar kii kasar nikaalte hue isisi world cap-2011 ke udghaatan match main bangladesh ko 87 ranon se maat di
 This time Bangladesh won the toss and invited India to bat
 bharat ne is match main virendra sahvaag (175) or viraat kohli (naabad 100) kii damdaar pariyon ke bal par chaar wicket khokar 370 ranon kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya
 Tamim Iqbal (70) once again played a good innings for Bangladesh after chasing a huge target and Shakib Al Hasan also contributed 55 runs
 lekin munaf patel (48 / 4) , jahir khan (40 / 2) kii kasi hui gendbaaji ke aage bangladesh team nau wicket khokar 283 ran hi bana saki
 Since the defeat at the hands of Bangladesh in the ICC World Cup-2007, the two teams have played against each other 13 times and only once did India face defeat in the Asia Cup-2012
 asia cap 2011-12 ke us match main bangladesh ke haathon mili haar is myne main bhi chakit karne vaali rahi, kyonki bhartiya team sachin tendulkar (114) ke 100wein or aakhri antarrashtriya shatak ke bal par 289 ranon kaa bada score khadaa karne main safal rahaa tha
 Apart from Tendulkar, Kohli (66) and Suresh Raina (51) had played half-century innings
 gauratlab he ki tameem ikbaal (70) ekbar phir bharat ke khilaaf bangladesh ke sankatmochak banakar ubhare or shaakib al hasan (49) ne bhi ahm yogadan diya

 dilli police ne ek aise gang kaa pardaafash kiya he, jiskaa sargana police kii vardi pahanakar dilli main lut kii vaardaaton ko anjaam de rahaa tha

 The man in uniform told Haneef that he had some charges with him and had to leave the Nangloi police station
 hanif vardeevaale par bharosa kar baithe or un sabhi ko gaadi main baitha liya
 As the car approached, the man wearing a uniform pointed a pistol at Hanif's head and stopped the car and made him sit on the back seat
 tab hanif ko samaj aayaa ki vardeevaale ke bhesh main ye lutere hai
 The crooks roamed all night with Hanif
 gaadi main ful kam tha
 Then they reached a petrol pump and put fuel there
 vardi vaala shaks vahaan lage sisitivi camere main kaid ho gaya
 From there, these miscreants also picked up a dog from the path
 iske baad badmaashon ne hanif ko haryana border par haath pair baandh kar phenk diya
 In the morning, Haneef somehow reached the Mianwali police station in Delhi and told the Aapbeeti police
 police ne turant maamla darj kar liya
 After some time, the police got information that a man riding a white Scorpio car on the Haryana border was recovering money from the truckers
 police fouran harakat main aa gai kyonki hanif kii gaadi bhi safed rang kii scorpiyo hi thi
 It did not take long for the police to understand that it could be a gang that hunted Haneef
 police kii team turant maukey par pahunchi or haryana police kii madad se farji vardi vaale ko uske giraftaar kar liya
 Who was identified as Rahul
 vahi is gang kaa sargana he
 During interrogation, the police came to know that this gang had been carrying out such incidents since 2014
 abhi tak ye badmaash 2 darjan se zyada vaaradaaten kar chuke hai
 The idea of carrying out the uniform was also Rahul's idea
 police ko pataa chalaa ki yah gang keval raat ke vaqt hi vaardaaton ko anjaam detaa tha
 Rahul was always a police uniform
 isliye koi bhi shaks use pulisavaala samaj kar gaadi roak letaa tha or phir wo lut kaa shikaar ban jaataa tha
 The police is now tracing their old history
 ek arab se bhi zyada logon kii nigahen is match par thim, haalanki bharat main is match ko kisi bhi tarah se dekh paanaa sambhav nahin tha kyonki tivi kya internet par bhi is match kaa prasaaran nahin ho rahaa tha
 Still people were eager to know the condition of this match in some way
 jo log team india ke maichon main dilchaspee nahin bhi rakhte the wo bhi oman ke khilaaf bhartiya team ke pradarshan ke baad aaj ke match kaa haal jaanane ke liye pareshaan the
 The news of the match was being filtered through Twitter and Facebook
 jab match ke 38wein minute main khabar mili kii gol to ho gaya lekin guam kii taraf se, to bhartiya prashansakon ne sochaa ki koi baat nahin hamaare paas chhetri he wo badla legaa
 But gradually it started to understand that nothing was kept for us in this match and this match has come out of the hands of our players playing in front of about 4500 local spectators
 or match ke 62wein minute main is baat par muhar lagaai guam ke trevis ne jab unhone apni team kii badhat ko doguna kar diya
 Not once in the entire match did it feel that the Indian team is playing 33 places below their team in FIFA rankings, the players of India were not in rhythm at all
 2018 fifa vishwacap ke kwalifyres ke duusare round ke duusare match main bhibhartiya team ko haar miliis baar bhi score rahaa 2-1
 Although Indian striker Sunil Chhetri definitely scored a goal in extra time of the match, that goal was not enough to save the match
 apane pichley match main turkmenistan ko 1-0 se haraane vaali guam kii team is jeet ke saath hi group di main sheersh par pahunch gai
 The defeat has also shocked India's hopes of getting into the top three of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers

 The world's leading social networking company Snapchat has clarified its statement by its CEO Evan Spiegel that India is 'poor'
 apane bayaan ke kaaran har jagah se aalochanaayen jhelane or google ke ap store par reating ke girane se pareshaan snapchet ab kshatipurti karata najar aa rahaa he
 Significantly, Snapchat said in its statement, "we are proud of the community on Snapchat in India and the rest of the world

 In fact, recently, Snapchat's former employee Anthony Pompliano had said this in his complaint to the court, quoting Spiegel, who Snapchat called 'ridiculous'
 pompliano ne isi varsh janvari main los angelis kii superior court main yah mukadmaa darj kiya tha
 Snap Inc
 made the envelope's copy of this non-edited complaint public last week without editing it
 kya tha maamlagauratlab he, isi shikaayat main pompliano ne daawa kiya he ki sitambar, 2015 main unase spigel ne snapchet ke mobile ap ke antarrashtriya vikaas yojana ke bare main kaha tha, "yah ap sirf amir logon ke liye he
 i do not want to take it to poor countries like India and Spain
 " spigel kaa yah bayaan saamne aane ke saath hi snapchet ko samooche vishwa se aalochanaayen jhelni padi, khaskar bharat se

 Talking about the dress code of students is common, but what is the matter of deciding the dress code of teachers of government schools in Himachal Pradesh

 pradesh ke shiksha mantri suresh bharadwaj ne kaha, solan (himachal pradesh) ke ek sarkari ucchtar madhyamik vidhyalay ke shikshakon ke liye dress code he
 If other schools follow it then there is no harm
 shiksha mantri ne kaha ki dress code lagu karne se pehle ham jald hi shikshakon ke saath baatcheet karenge
 Officials have stated that the purpose of the dress code is to prevent teachers from wearing short and tight clothes
 yahaan ke ucch shiksha nideshak amarjit sharma ne kaha ki shikshak chaatro ke liye adarsh hote hai
 Students learn from the simplicity of the teacher
 yadi shikshak sada rahenge to jaahir he ki bachche bhi unka anusaran karenge
 Let there be a total of 15,162 schools in Himachal
 jisamen se 10,650 praathmik or 4,512 ucch praathmik hai
 It may be said that the government is proposing formal pants and shirts for male teachers
 vahiin mahila shikshakon ke liye sari yaa salwar suut dresscode hoga
 In addition, female teachers may be prohibited from wearing leggings or jeans

 At the same time, many teachers have raised objection on this

 dwen smith (62) or brendan maikalam (46) ke bich hui 109 ranon kii aatishi saajhedaari kii badaulat chennai super kings ne mumbai indiens ko chah wicket se maat de di
 The Super Kings achieved the target of 184 runs from Mumbai, dwarfing the target, losing four wickets with 20 balls remaining and registering their third consecutive win in IPL-8
 match kaa scorcard dekhen
 
 
 On the other hand, the fate of Mumbai Indians did not support him in the fourth match in a row and he still remained away from the first win in IPL-8
 maine kisi se 16 karod kii boli lagane ko nahin kaha: yuvarajchennai super kings kii parivishaal lakshya kaa peechha karne utre super kings ko smith or maiklam ne apeksha se kahin behatar shuruyaat dilaai or ipel main powerple kaa doosraa sabase tej score bana daalaa
 The record of scoring the most 100 runs in the powerplay is also in the name of the Super Kings, which he had made against the Kings XI Punjab team in the previous edition
 smith or maikalam kii is tufaani saajhedaari par harbhajan singh ne lagaam lagaai
 Harbhajan picked up the wickets of mccallum and Smith respectively on the second and sixth balls of the eighth over
 maikalam kaa kaich vinay kumaar ne jabaki smith kaa kaich rohit sharma ne lapka
 Before returning to the pavilion, however, Smith and mccallum smashed the mammoth target with a 109-run opening partnership
 donon ballebaaj jab pavilion laute to super kings ke aath overon main 115 ran ho chuke the or unhen shesh 12 overon main jeet ke liye maatr 69 ran or banane rah gaye the

 iske baad suresh raina (naabad 43) ne shandaar pari khelte hue team ko jeet tak pahunchaa diya
 Raina hit four fours and two sixes in his innings of 29 balls
 jeet ke liye aakhri ran dwen braavo (naabad 13) ne 17wein over kii chauthi gend par chakka jadkar hasil kiya
 In front of the Super Kings batsmen, none of the Mumbai Indians bowlers failed to impress
 do over main 18 ran dene vaale vinay kumaar sabase kifayati gendbaaj rahe, haalanki vah koi bhi wicket hasil karne main asafal rahe
 On the other hand, Harbhajan, who took the most two wickets, took 44 runs in 4 overs
 mumbai indiens kii pariisse pehle toss jitkar ballebaaji karne utre mumbai indiens kii shuruyaat haalanki kaaphi kharaab rahi or 12 ran par uske sheersh teen ballebaaji pavilion laut chuke the
 After this, however, skipper Rohit Sharma (50) first put on 45 runs for the fourth wicket with Harbhajan Singh (24) and then 75 runs for the fifth wicket with Kieran Pollard (64), bringing the team to a strong position
 
 isse pehle chotil aron finch kii jagah lendil simons, parthiv patel ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne utre
 However, Patel was declared lbw for Ashish Nehra without opening the account in the first over
 nehra ne apane agle hi over main kori anderson (4) ko bhi fof du plasis ke haathon kaich out karvaa diya or simons bhi paanch ran ke nijee yoga par plasis ko kaich thama baithe
 Ishwar Pandey took the wicket of Simmons
 iske baad haalanki rohit or pollard ne maatr 33 gendon main aatishi saajhedaari nibhaai
 Harbhajan, who came out to bat at number five, hit two fours and a six in 21 balls
 30 gendon main paanch chaukaa or ek chakka lagaakar ardhashatak puraa karne ke thik baad ashish nehra ne dwen braavo ko haathon lapakvaa kar rohit kii pari kaa samaapan kiya
 Meanwhile, playing in a very aggressive style, Pollard hit 26 balls in the 14th over with three sixes off Ravindra Jadeja
 pollard ne chathe wicket ke liye ambati raidu (29) ke saath 49 ranon kii saajhedaari nibhaai or team ko achche score tak pahunchaa diya
 Both batsmen, however, were bowled by Dwayne Bravo for the fourth and fifth consecutive balls of the last over
 donon hi ballebaaj oonche shot lagane ke prayaas main kaich out hue
 Rayudu catches Jadeja, while Pollard catches Dwayne Smith
 raidu ne jahaan 16 gendon main ek chaukaa or teen chakka lagaaya vahiin pollard ne apni tufaani pari main 30 gendon kaa saamana kar chaar chauke or paanch chakke jade
 Ashish Nehra bowled best for the Super Kings and took three wickets for 23 runs in four overs
 aakhri over main aath ran dekar do wicket lene vaale braavo ne chaar overon ke apane spel main kul 30 ran die
 Team India's solid batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has given the reason behind the success of Ravichandran Ashwin as spin bowler
 pujaara ke anusaar, aswin itane shandaar gendbaaj isliye hai kyonki ve ballebaajon kii tarah sochate hai
 Ashwin completed the feat on the fourth day of the match, taking 250 Test wickets in the fewest matches
 unhone apane 45wein test main hi 250 wicket ke aankade ko choote hue australian tej gendbaaj denis lily ke record ko peeche choda
 Lily took 250 wickets in 48 Tests
 tippaniyan Pujara said after the end of the fourth day of the Test against Bangladesh, he said, 'in my opinion, Ashwin is the toughest spinner for any rival team
 team ab yojana banaati hai ki ve kis tarah se aswin kaa saamana karengi
 He (ashwin) thinks as a batsman what his weakness is and what line and length he should bowl
 mujhe lagata he ki yah uskaa anubhav he jo use is team kaa ek mukhya gendbaaj banaata he
 In the first innings, Ashwin took almost 100 runs to take only two wickets, but Pujara defended the off-spinner saying that he (ashwin) was given the role of putting pressure on the batsmen
 unhone kaha, ‘vah (aswin) samajhataa he ki aise bhi halaat honge jisamen use kasi gendbaaji kerani hogi
 If you look in the first innings, he tried his best
 usne ek ranneeti ke tahat gendbaaji kii
 There will be some occasions when he cannot get a wicket
 lekin is bhartiya team kii sabase badhiya cheez yahi he ki ham bataur ikai gendbaaji karte hai, ham zyaadaatar saajhedaari main gendbaaji karte hai
 Ashwin is a bowler who takes wickets and Jadeja plays the role of pressure on the batsmen
 kabhi kabhaar aswin ko ballebaajon ko ran banane se rokane kii bhoomika nibhaani hoti he or usne pehali pari main aisa kiya
 ' pujaara ne bangladesh ke khilaaf test ke chauthe din kaa khel samaapt hone ke baad kaha, ‘meri raay main aswin kisi bhi pratidwandvi team ke liye sabase mushkil spinner hai
 The team now plans how they will face Ashwin
 vah (aswin) ballebaaj ke taur par sochataa he ki uski kamajori kya he or use kis line evam length main gendbaaji kerani chahie
 i think it is his experience that makes him one of the main bowlers of this team
 ’ pehali pari main aswin ne keval do wicket hasil karne ke liye kareeb 100 ran lutaae lekin pujaara ne is of spinner kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki unhen (aswin ko) ballebaajon par dabaav banane kii bhoomika di gai thi
 He said, 'he (ashwin) understands that there will be situations in which he will have to bowl a lot
 agar aap pehali pari main dekho to usne apana sarvshereshth prayaas kiya
 He bowled as a strategy
 aise bhi kuch maukey honge, jab vah wicket hasil nahin kar saktaa
 But the best thing about this Indian team is that we bowl as a unit, we bowl mostly in partnership
 aswin aisa gendbaaj he jo wicket jhatakta he or jadeja ballebaajon par dabaav banane kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Sometimes Ashwin has to play the role of preventing batsmen from scoring runs and he did so in the first innings
 ’ He said, 'he (ashwin) understands that there will be situations in which he will have to bowl a lot

 supreme courtmen aaj asaram baapu se balaatkaar ke maamle main gavaahon kii suraksha maangane ko lekar daayar yachika par sunwaayee ho rahi thi
 During the last hearing, the government had told the Supreme Court that it had prepared a witness protection scheme which would be converted into law in due course
 sarkaar ne kaha tha ki tab tak supreme court rajyon se is masaude kaa paalan karne ke liye kah saktaa he
 Today the Supreme Court did the same
 court ne rajyon ko kaha he ki jab tak ki ise kanoon nahin banaaya jaataa tab tak ve gavaah sangrakshan yojana ke masaude kaa paalan karen
 According to the previous draft published by the government, the witness protection scheme was for the protection of those who appear as a witness in criminal cases

 @fuhsephantom@83_thefilm Addressing a gathering in Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Jhansi said that the government's responsibility has increased after the drastic victory
 unhone kaha ki agle 2 saalon main bundelkhand se pani kii kami kii samasya ko khatm kar denge
 He ordered the officials of the power department to either fix or replace the defective power transformer in Bundelkhand within 48 hours
 siem ne bada elaan karte hue kaha ki bundelkhand ko dilli ke saath 6 len express-ve se joda jayegounhone kaha ki soobe main ab koi bhookha nahin soyega
 Ration cards will be made for poor and destitute people
 siem ne kaha ki bhrashtachar se koi samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 He said that his workers should work for the service of the public and should not take the law in their hands
 isse pehle siem yogi ne jhaansi pahunchate hi civil aspataal kaa auchak nirikshan kiya
 After this, he left for the local grain market
 siem banane ke baad yogi kaa yah pehla bundelkhand kaa daura he
 CM also inspected the wheat purchasing center in the grain market
 siem ne kray centre main maujuud kai adhikariyon ko fatkaar bhi lagaai
 CM Yogi has sought a report on the suicide of two farmers in Bundelkhand
 primary skool pahunche yogyaspataal or genhu kray centre ke nirikshan ke baad siem yogi ek primary skool kaa nirikshan karne pahunche
 The CM took information of the mid-day meal here and took stock of drinking water in class
 yogi ne vahaan maujuud bacchon se bhi baat kii
 Farmers' organizations will count their grievances
 During this visit of YM Yogi can meet a group of farmers
 bhartiya kisaan union kaa kahana he ki pichley 22 maheene main lagbhag 850 kisaanon se khudakhushi kii he, jisamen se 178 ko muaavja mil paaya he
 According to the farmers, they are not getting exemption in electricity bills, the farmers said that because their land is not yet fertile, they will not get the benefit of loan waiver
 bundalekhand par vishesh dhyanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni chunavi raily main kaha tha ki agar upi main bijepi kii sarkaar banati he to vikaas kaa 14 saal kaa vanvaas khatm hoga or upi ko desh ke vikaas kaa ingine banaaya jayega
 The Yogi government has announced a payable water project for Bundelkhand
 iske saath hi yogi sarkaar ne bundelkhand ko 20 ghante bijli dene kaa elaan bhi kiya he
 It is worth noting that Bundelkhand is considered to be the most backward and poor area of uttar Pradesh, farmers' suicide in Bundelkhand is on a high level
 chunaav ke dauraan bhi bundelkhand kaa vikaas kaaphi ahm mudda tha
 The Modi government at the center and the Yogi government of the state are therefore paying special attention to Bundelkhand
 bundelkhand kaa upi main kaaphi mahatv he, chunaav ke dauraan bijepi or piem modi ne bundelkhand par vishesh dhyaan dene kii baat kahi thi
 Why is Kajal made from lamp after laxmi-ganesh Puja on Diwali? Happy xxwrep 9 diwalihappy Diwali metro dilli kii shaan bani he, to iske peeche metro kaa shandaar record bhi he or isamen sabase badi khubi he vakt ke pehle kaam khatm karnaa lekin is baar yani tisare fez main metro kii chaal ladkadaane lagi he
 Metro officials themselves are agreeing to this
 tisare fez main metro kaa 140 kilometre lanbaa root taiyaar hona he
 Tenders have been done, but work has not started in many places, in such a case, the deadline of 2016 may prove difficult for the metro
 metro ke liye musiibat isliye bhi bad gai he, kyonki duusare fez kii tarah is baar sarkaar ke saamne kaamanwealth khelon jaisi koi dedline nahi hai
 It is obvious that the relaxation of the government agencies will also become an obstacle in the way of the metro
 varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi punjab desh ke chunavi rujhaan se itar jane kii apni chhavi par kaayam rahaa
 In fact, Punjabi voters preferred the recent 'kranti' in Delhi over the 'modi wave' and surprisingly put four Lok Sabha seats in the state in the bag of the newly-formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 lekin, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main punjab ne dikhaa diya ki vahi congress kii 'vaapasi karaane vaala rajya' sabit saktaa he
 Giving its initial indication, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the state also elected Congressmen on three seats out of its 13 mps
 tatkaaleen sattarudh shiromani akali dal-bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) gathbandhan ne teen-teen loksabhaa siten jiti thim, lekin yah spasht dikh rahaa tha ki punjab main uske gathbandhan kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 Since then a lot of water has flowed into Vyas, Sutlej and Ravi
 2017 kii shuruyaat main rajya main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main captain amarinder singh ke netritv main congress ne vidhansabha kii 117 siton main se do-tihaai siten apni jholii main daalate hue shandaar jeet darj kii
 In these assembly elections, Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP coalition's feet were uprooted
 vahiin aap ne majbootee ke saath khud ko pehle se hi 'vijeta' ghoshit kar rakhaa tha, par use keval 20 siten hi milin
 As always, it is difficult to predict where the wind will blow in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Punjab, but there are some factors such as the opposition parties' own troubles which give a clear indication
 aap or shiromani akali dal donon hi aantarik vidrohon se buree tarah hili hui hai
 When AAP and Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira demanded more powers to be given to the Punjab unit of the party for a decision in the organization of Punjab, angry Arvind Kejriwal showed Khaira a way out of the party in July 2018
 uske baad sukhpal singh khera kii aguai main aap ke saat vidhayakon kaa ek chota baagi samooh ban gaya
 This storm in AAP blew away the party's prospects in the state
 sukhpal singh khera ne tab aap vidrohiyon ke ek chote-se samooh ke saath milakar ek alag party punjabi ekta party (pieepi) banaai
 PEP is now in the process of joining the Punjab Democratic Alliance (PDA) consisting of BSP and Shiromani Akali dal-taksali (akali-t)
 taksaali party shiromani akali dal ke un puraane diggaj netaaon kaa ek samooh he jinhone party adhyaksh sukhbir singh badal kii 'nirankush netritv style' kaa virodh karte hue pichley saal akali dal chhod diya tha
 Under the leadership of Taksali Khadur Sahib MP Ranjit Singh Brahmapura, the Shiromani Akali Dal's traditional Sikh vote can dent its prospects by making a big dent
 varsh 2015 main guru granth sahib kii brudabi kii ghatnaon kii vajah se sikh shraddhaluon main jabardast naaraazgi paidaa ho gai thi
 Protests were held at various places in Punjab
 is prakaran ne shiromani akali dal ke sangrakshak or purv mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal tathaa unke bete sukhbir singh badal ke liye chizon ko or mushkil bana diya tha
 That matter still does not seem to leave the Badal family behind
 saamaanya taur par 2015 kii is ghatana par ab tak mitti pad jaani chahie thi lekin ranjit singh ayog kii ore se purv mukhyamantri par abhiyog chalaane ke sanketon ne janata ke bich is ghatana ko sulgaae rakhaa he
 The commission was formed to investigate the police firing on protesters following the events of October 2015 after the new Congress came to power in the state
 badal parivaar ne samajhadaari dikhaate hue pradhanmantri narendra modi or rashtriya suraksha ko centre main rakhkar gathbandhan sahyogi bhaajapa ke chunavi vimarsh ko apana liya he
 In fact, in his public meetings, Sukhbir Badal is constantly insisting on "vote for a Prime Minister who foes India's enemies"
 lekin agar bharat ke sashastr balon ko lekar punjab kaa koi rajaneta sabase zyada utsaah dikhaa rahaa he, to ve captain amarinder singh hai
 Former military officer Amarinder Singh actively participated in the indo-pak war of 1965
 haal hi main 14 farvari ko jammu-kashmir main pulavama hamale ke baad javaabi karrwai kii maang karne vaale logon main, punjab ke mukhyamantri sabase aage the
 Unlike other members of his party, he has not let any controversy arise at his level regarding the success of the Balakot air strikes
 vahiin, vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki punjab main shiromani akali dal or aap ke vot bank ko hathiyaane ke liye in donon dalon ke baagi guton ke bich sangharsh jitna zyada tej hoga, congress utane phaayde main rahegi
 It has been two years since the Congress came to power and the party has won the by-elections in the Lok Sabha seat of Gurdaspur and the Assembly seat in Shahkot, besides winning a major victory in the municipal and panchayat elections
 jaahir he, mukhyamantri amarinder singh apni jeet kaa silsilaa jari rakhane ko lekar aashwast dikhte hai
 "we (shiromani Akali Dal and AAP) will beat them badly again," says the chief minister
 '' congress ko bharosa he ki matadaata jab 19 may ko vot daalane jaaenge to punjab sarkaar kii ore se krishi rin maafee kaa faisla, aparaadh par lagaam or narendra modi sarkaar ke notebandi or maal evam vastu kar (jiesti) ke faisle se upja sankat unhen congress ke paksh main vot daalane ko prerit karegaa
 Buoyed by the victory in the political by-poll Amarinder Singh by-election, the Chief Minister appears confident of blowing the dust to the opposition, Prakash Singh Badal, despite being an elder, only the patron of the Shiromani Akali Dal takes the final decision on party related issues

 According to some reports, the second season of the series can be released in June or July this year
 haalanki siries se jude kisi kalakaar ne is par koi baat nahin kii he
 But during the promotion of Thackeray, Nawaz has told an interesting anecdote about this series
 film campanian ke liye anupama chopra se baatcheet ke dauraan navazuddin ne secred games ke duusare sijan ke bare main baat kii
 On one question the actor said, "we were shooting in Nairobi, Kenya for the second season of Sacred Games
 jahaan ham shoot kar rahe the, vahaan ek british naagarik mila jiskaa bahut bada bangala he
 We wanted to shoot in his bungalow
 ""jab hamaari production team us angrej ke paas pahunchi to usne hamaare bare main jaankaree lee
 Our team told him that we are from the Netflix series Sacred Games and want to shoot in your bungalow
 ""itnaa sunanaa tha ki wo shaks kreji ho gaya or usne hamen apana bangala bina kisi sawaal jawaab ke de diya
 He also did not charge any fees

" 13 disambar ko main 60 saal kaa ho jaaoongaa, isliye ise dekhte hue maine do-teen saal pehle se hi iske bare main sochna shuru kar diya tha

 The reason behind not presenting the cabinet note in today's meeting is that the officer who was given the responsibility of this is not in Delhi
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki unke dilli main hone par hi yah note cabinet main charchaa ke liye laayaa jaataa
 The reason behind this is being told that if the government needed it, then some questions could be asked about it

 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 Now that the Ashok Lavasa committee has submitted its report to the government and soon Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will take a final decision on this report from the government

 aaj kii baithak main cabinet note pesh nahin kiye jane ke peeche kaaran yah gyaat hua ki jis adhikari ko iskaa jimmaa diya gaya tha ve dilli main nahin he
 It is believed that this note would have been brought for discussion in the cabinet only when he was in Delhi

 It is worth mentioning that on June 28 last year, the government decided to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar ne vetan ayog kii siforishein 1 janvari 2016 se lagu karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 But after several recommendations of the Pay Commission, the Central employees had raised their objection on many issues

 None of his sons had any children
 ek budhi mata ne brahmani ko putr-vadhuon se vrath karne ko kaha, unhone sheetala mata kaa shashti vrath karne kii salaah di
 That Brahmani fasted devoutly
 vrath se uski putr vadhuon ko santan ki prapti hui
 Once the Brahmin did not follow the law of fasting
 vrath ke din garm jal se snaan kar liya
 Eat fresh food even on the day of fasting and did not follow the rules and regulations laid down during the fast
 yahi galati brahmani kii bahuon ne bhi kii
 The same night the brahmani had a terrible dream
 vah swapn main jaag gai
 The brahmini saw that all his family members were dead
 apane parivaar ke sadasyon ko dekh kar vah shok karne lagi, use padosiyon ne bataaya kii bhagwati sheetala mata ke prakope se hua he
 Hearing this, the Brahman's moan increased
 vah roti hui jangal kii ore chalane lagi
 He found an old lady in the forest
 vah budhiya agni kii jwaala main tadap rahi thi
 The old lady said that to remove the burning sensation of fire, apply it in a clay pot with curd
 isse uski jwaala shant ho jaaegi or sharir swasth ho jayega
 On hearing this, the Brahmin felt great remorse
 usne mata se kshamaa maangi or apane parivaar ko jeevat karne kii vinati kii
 Mother appeared to him and ordered the dead to be coated with curd
 brahmani ne vaisaa hi kiya or aisa karne ke baad uske parivaar ke saare sadsy jivit ho uthe
