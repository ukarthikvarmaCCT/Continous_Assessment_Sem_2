 The commission report also mentions that 140 countries have abolished capital punishment in the 21st century
 bharat main bhi durlabhtam or nrushansatam maamalon main hi faansee kii sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 But the Supreme Court itself has admitted many times that this principle has also been used arbitrarily
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko sahaara samooh kii khinchaai karte hue kaha ki vah use halke main nahin len
 The Sahara group had issued advertisements in various newspapers, accusing market regulator Sebi of being a 'government goon'
 sebi niveshkon ko 20,000 karod rupee kaa rifund nahin karne ke liye sahaara ke khilaaf kadam uthaa rahaa he
 a bench of justices KS Radhakrishnan and JS Khehar have taken seriously the Sahara advertisement alleging that the group has 'discovered suspects' by SEBI
 nyaayalay ne sahaara se kaha he ki vah unheen akhabaaron main khed prakashit karwaae
 The bench said, 'we will take all this very seriously
 hamen halke main na len
 You are not going to get anything from it, you understand that you are facing disobedience
 is tarah ke kaamon se maamle bigadenge
 He (sebi) is the statutory authority performing his duties and obeying our orders
 yah kya he?' a lawyer from Sahara Group immediately apologized in this case
 is bich sahaara samooh ne apni 71 sampattiyon se jude dastavej sebi ko pratibhuti yaa jamaanat ke rup main dene par sahmati jataai he
 The group claims that these assets are valued at Rs 20,000 crore
 nyaayalay ne haalanki sahaara kii is yachika ko khaarij kar diya ki uske pramukh subrat raay ko videsh yatra kii anumati di jaae
 The court banned Subrata Roy for not handing over the documents to SEBI
 nyaayalay ne kaha, 'yah sthiti utpann nahin hoti agar aapane hamaare adeshon kaa paalan kiya hota, sebi ko dastavej saunpe hote or dhan rifund ke liye sansaadhan die hote
 You are not going to get anything from this hide and seek
 ' The Sahara group wants the travel ban imposed on Roy on November 21 to be abolished
 samooh ne kaha ki usne 71 sampattiyon ke tital dead (malikana haq sambandhi dastavej) sebi ko saunp die hai
 The court has given time to SEBI to verify these documents and fixed the next hearing of the case on 9 January
 nyaayalay ne sahaara kii us yachika ko bhi khaarij kar diya jisamen usne apni samooh companiyon ke bank khaaton par lagi roak hataane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Sahara group says that the properties for which documents have been given are in Mumbai, Kochi, Noida, Ajmer, Aligarh, Haridwar, Muzaffarnagar, Raipur, Amritsar, Jhansi, Kanpur and Faridabad
 pashchim bengal lokayukta sanshodhan vidheyak 2018 ko 23 july ko rajya kii vidhayika se manjuuri mil gai he
 This law puts the Chief Minister out of the purview of Lokayukta
 rajya sarkaar dwaara jari gajet ke anusaar yah sanshodhan "mukhyamantri ke khilaaf saarvajanik vyavastha se jude bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii shikaayat ko jaanch ke daayre se baahar karata he or kisi saarvajanik adhikari ke khilaaf shikaayat kii jaanch bhi rajya sarkaar kii manjuuri ke bagaiyr nahin ho sakegi
 "no such relief was granted to the Chief Minister in the original Lokayukta Act brought by the then Buddhadeb Bhattacharya government in 2003, although a shield was also provided for the Chief Minister
 usamen kaha gaya tha ki mukhyamantri yaa anya mantriyon or lok sevakon ke khilaaf pad ke durupyog kii shikayaton kii jaanch ke liye "upyukt athurity'' se manjuuri leni hogi
 For example, in the case of the Chief Minister, the approval of the two-thirds majority of the assembly and in the case of ministers the approval of the speaker of the assembly
 vammorcha ke netaaon ne mamata ke nae sanshodhan ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaani shuru kar di he
 Left Front Legislature Party leader Sujan Chakraborty said, "this (exemption to the Chief Minister) is discrimination and provides a way for the corrupt to escape
" '' vidhansabha main is par bahes kaa jawaab dete hue mamata banerjee ne kaha ki unhen chhot sirf "saarvajanik vyavastha'' ke maamle main mili hui he, jiskaa dayera bahut simit he
 He said, "other subjects of the state list come under the purview of the Lokayukta
 ''vipaksh ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue mukhyamantri ne kaha, "aapako lagata he ki yah kamjor vidheyak he
 
 
 So when you come in the government, you will change it according to your needs
 ''lekin maujuuda kanoon ke mutabik to "saarvajanik vyavastha'' ke alaava maamalon main bhi lokayukta ko mukhyamantri par bhrashtachar ke kisi aaropon kii jaanch ke liye vidhansabha ke do-tihaai bahumat kii manjuuri leni hogi
 The opposition is very upset with this
 rajya bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh poochhate hai, "mukhyamantri khud ko eemaandaaree kii pratik bataati hai, to bhala ve in sudhaaron ke jariye chhot hasil kar khud ko surakshit kyon rakhana chaahati hai?'' haalanki, mamata banerjee kahati hai ki sanshodhit vidheyak centre sarkaar dwaara paarit lokapal or lokayukta act, 2013 ke anuroop he, jisamen pradhanmantriyon ko isi tarah kii chhot di gai he
 Health Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya of the Trinamool Congress government also tried to justify the exemption granted to the Chief Minister as per the Act of the Central Government
 congress netaa abdul mannaan purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara lokapal ke daayre se pradhanmantriyon ko baahar rakhane ko vaazib tehraate hai
 In Kolkata, speculation has intensified as to whether this move is an attempt to keep Mamata Banerjee out of the purview of financial scandals such as Sarada and Narada (jailed Sharda chief Sudipto bought Mamta's painting at an astonishing price) 
 lekin mukhyamantri is baat par jor detii hai, "sirf janata meri vishwasaneeyata par sawaal khadey kar sakati he
 Taking a dig at the Gandhi family of the Congress, he said that there was no Lokpal at the time of Rajiv Gandhi, yet he could not escape the Bofors investigation
 aakhirkaar tamaam ho-hangaame ke baavjood yah sanshodhan bill baari bahumat se paas ho gaya
 However, many still consider it a sign of "weakness"
 kya mamata banerjee ko apni party kii buniyaad hilne kaa dar he?*** jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind claimed support for Narendra Modi's rally with twenty thousand Muslims
 shuukravaar ko turkman get ilaake main jamaat ne raily bhi kerani chaahi lekin isaki ijaajat police ne nahin di
 Jamaat says that they want to deny the propaganda of Congress that Muslims are not with BJP
 bijepi ke state headquarter 14 pantamarg main jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind ke ulimaon kii baithak raashtragan se shuru hui
 Earlier the song Vande Mataram was decided but it was not agreed upon
 baithak main yun to vijendra gupta or vijay goyal ko bhi aana tha lekin aae sirf vijay joli
 However, jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind president Maulana Suhaib Kasami claimed in the meeting that the Congress had cheated the country for the last 65 years and that it would have to bear the brunt in the upcoming elections
 moulana ne kaha ki wo turkman get par raily kar musalamaanon main ekta kaa sandesh dena chaahate the lekin congress ne police par ijaajat naa dene kaa dabaav daalaa
 Maulana Suhaib Kasami, president of jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind said, "we wanted to rally at Turkman Gate but there are both mlas and mps from Congress and they did not allow us to rally
" ham 20 se 25 hajaar musalmaan bhaaiyon ke saath pahunchakar narendra modi ji ko samarthan denge
 The state BJP did not even have a big official in the meeting with the ulema
 pehle vijendra gupta kaa aana tay tha lekin wo bhi nahin aae
 Reaching the meeting, Vijay Jolly said that his party is giving a message to take the entire society including Muslims along
 bijepi netaa vijay joli ne kaha, 'ham samaaj ke sabhi logon ko saath lekar chalane ke himachati hai or yahi sandesh ham modi ji kii raily main bhi dena chaahate hai
 'BJP is distributing pamphlets in mosques The BJP is also distributing pamphlets in around 100 mosques in the capital to mobilize Muslims in Modi's rally
 modi ko lekar muslimon kii shankaaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye party ne khaas parche chhapavaye hai jisamen 1947 se lekar ab tak desh main hue bade dangon kii fehrist jari kii gai he
 What is written in the pamphlet Atif Rashid, president of Delhi bjp's Minority Front, has also claimed that more than 20,000 Muslims will gather in the rally
 rashid ne kaha, 'muslim samudaay ne godhra dangon ko lekar sawaal kiye lekin hamane unka jawaab is parche main diya he ki aazaadee ke baad se desh main hajaaron sampradayik dange hue hai
 It also tells about the current state of Gujarat and the economic condition of the Muslims there
 ' unhone bataaya ki muslim bahul ilaakon se logon ko raily main laane ke liye 340 basen lagaai gai hai
 Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijay Malhotra said that diplomats from more than 40 countries have agreed to attend the rally

 buudhvaar kii raat kai vaahanon main aagjanee bhi kii gai thi
 a heavy police force is stationed in Anandpal's village and adjoining areas
 jaankaree mili he ki police prashasan neanandpal singhke parivaar ko ek notice dekar kaha tha ki agar unhone uske shav kaa antim sanskaar nahin kiya to majaburi main yah kaam police prashasan karegaa
 After this warning, the gangster Anandpal Singh was forcibly cremated by the Rajasthan Police after twenty days in Muktidham on Thursday

 Raja is the prime accused in the 2G spectrum case
 purvi uttar pradesh main baadh peediton ke liye bane sarkari raahat camp, unhen raahat se adhik dard de rahe hai
 The pain of flood victims in Ballia district, who lost everything in the flood relief camps, is different
 ilaake main jab 'aaj tak' kii team ek raahat shivi main pahunchi, to ye dekhakar dang rah gai ki baadh peediton ko raahat campon main khaanaa tak nahin mil rahaa
 Found in a water tanker, people are getting leeches in the water tanker sent by the government, after which people have stopped drinking government water and are eating and eating themselves
 sarkari raahat shivi to ban gaye, lekin log apana khaanaa yaa to kharidkar yaa banaakar kha rahe hai
 The reason is that people have started cooking themselves in the relief camps leaving the trust of the government
 enech-31 par banaae gaye hai kai raahat shivibliyamhar se kareeb 25 kimi dur enech-31 par kai raahat shivi banaae gaye hai, jisame dubahad ilaake ke raahat camp main jab 'aaj tak' kii team baadh peediton kaa haal jaanane pahunchi, to ye dekhakar dang rah gai ki baadh peediton ke aansu ponchney vaala koi nahin he, bhukh se bilakhte bacchon or pariwaron ke liye raahat campon main logon ne khud hi khaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya he
 People are buying food on their own
 When the 'aaj Tak' team reached a family eating food in the night camp, it was found out that this family has bought ration with their own money and are eating and cooking themselves because the administration has given them here Having transported it, it has been celebrated and there is no one to ask them
 camp main naa khaanaa he or naa hi panimahilaon kii aakhon mendardahai, ghar kai kilometre dur ufnaati ganga main dub rahaa he, to raahat campo main naa to khaanaa he naa hi pani
 Rajbhar Rai, present in this relief camp, also showed the water kept in the bucket, in which leech is swimming
 pani usee raahat shivi main rakhe gaye sarkari tanker kaa tha, jise log sthaneey prashasan ko bhi dikhaa chuke hai
 There are no medicines in the relief camp, no food before, then insects in the water, many people have started leaving the relief camp
 is raahat camp main kai log aise mili, jinhen baadh main keede-makodon ke kaate jane se kai tarah ki bimaariyaan ho gai hai, lekin dawaaiyon ke naam par kuch bhi nahin he
 Due to lack of government facility in these relief camps, people have also started leaving government relief camps

 Bikanerwala has carved a niche for itself on the basis of its fragrance and taste and then worldwide
 aakhir isaki buniyadi safalataa kaa raaj kya he? emdi shyaam sundar agarwal kehete hai, "yah raaj badi buniyadi-si baat main samaaya he or vah he gunvattta kii guarantee
 This is our basic mantra
 '' isi mul mantra ko pakade rahane kaa nateeja he ki unke menu main aaj 150 se zyada food product aa jude hai
 By the way, the Agrawal family has been in this business of taste for over a century
 lekin rajasthan se nikalakar dilli main apane khantee aanchalik swaad kii mahak bikherne kaa sapana liye agarwal ke pita jugal kishor agarwal apane bhaaiyon ke saath 1950 main dilli padhaare
 He started a small shop with a small shop in Moti Bazaar in Chandni Chowk
 aaj desh bhar main bikanerwala ke 90 store hai
 Shyam Sundar was not satisfied with this only
 jab burgers or pitja bazaar main utarkar macdonald or dominoj jaise foodbrand duniyabar ke shaukeenon kii jubaan par chadh sakate hai to "khaane kaa khajaana'' liye ham kyon nahin duniya ko apane swaad kaa divaana bana sakate
 His thinking was clear
 so ab bikanerwala ke dubai main 11, nepal main 7, newjiland main 3, america or singapore main 2-2 store hai
 The specialty of taste: Bikanerwala claims that no matter the taste and quality will be found anywhere, anywhere from Rajasthan to abroad
 iske liye har varkar ko khaastaur par training di jaati he
 Bikanerwala is adding at least 4-5 new flavors, new products to its menu every year
 shyaam sundar bataate hai, "pichley saal hamane bhune besan kii barfi bazaar main utaari thi

 This group started new experiments only after coming to Delhi
 bikaner main bhujiyaa, baadaam katali or petha khaase mashhoor the
 But after coming here, cashew katli was included in its menu and Delhi people got caught on it
 dilli main gaay ke doodh se bane spanj rasagulle ko lokapriy banane kaa shrey bikanerwala ko hi jaataa he
 Shyam Sundar explains the interesting anecdote of joining the list of cashew katli, “the thing is in 1968, i came to Delhi from Bikaner to do my tenth degree to pursue further studies
 saal bhar koshish karne ke baavjood jab padhai main meraa man na tik paaya to pitaaji ne mujhe kaarkaane main laga diya
 i started making cashew katli
 kaashew ko bhigone se lekar sil par piskar uskaa paste taiyaar karne tak kii jimmedaari meri thi
 "the taste of his cashew katli has not been able to get off the tongue of Delhiites yet
" lekin unki bhujiyaa ke swaad kaa aakhir kya raaj he? shyaam sundar ke hi shabdon main, "hamane bhujiyaa talane ke liye ghi, dolada kii jagah moongfalee ke tel kaa istemaal shuru kiya
 The rest of our process of making Bhujia is special
 '' ve khud bhi khaane ke shaukeen hai

 Every time the woman brigade visits any of her restaurants without telling them, tasting the products there and surprise them
 swaad or gunvattta main jaraa bhi oonch-neech hone par ve fouran hamen ittala karti hai
 And the entire command of the group's e-business is in the hands of Priyanka, the daughter-in-law of the family
 apane khaas swaad ke boote hi is brand ne apane patibaddh graahak taiyaar kiye hai
 Umesh Sinha, an elderly couple who came to Delhi's Kirtinagar outlet for refreshments, and Shivani Raj were advising on what to take for dessert after ordering kachori
 shivani adi thim ki kaashew katali liya jaae to umesh jalibiyon kii jid pakade hue the
 Eventually it was decided to take both 200-200 grams
 umesh spasht karte hai, "pichley 30 saal se iske swaad kaa divaana hum
 No one can make cashew katli like them, but once their jalebis are consumed, it is difficult to miss
 '' bich main hi hansate hue shivani kahati hai, "dekha nahin, jalibiyon ke liye kisi jid pakadakar baith gaye the!''abhi to shuruyaat he

 There will be more than 150 products in this app
 idhar aapane kisi bhi product par ungali rakhi nahin ki udhar delivery boy daravaaje par pahunchaa nahin
 Not only this, the work of making the website like the tastes of user friendly and Bikanerwala is going on
 mashhoor hue duusare brands bhibikano, bikano chaat cafe or angan bhi isi group ke brand hai
 Shyam Sundar says that he really wanted to change the name of Bikanerwala

 # chaiwala a few months ago, the wound of the terrorist attack in Paris is still not healed that now the capital of Belgium, Brussels, has been targeted by the terrorists
 is hamale ko khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas ne anjaam diya
 After this attack, a question is arising in the whole world whether Baghdadi has conspired to attack this by daring the European countries
 dahal uthaa belgiyambelgium ke liye mangalvaar kii subah bahut amangalakaari rahi
 One after the other blasts, the capital city of Bresil was rocked by the bombings
 is aatanki hamale ke saath hi logon ke jehan main paris main hue aatanki hamalon kii kadavi yaaden taaja ho gayi
 Actually after this attack Parisian tears are coming out of Belgian eyes
 pehla dhamaakaa brussels ke javentem airport par hua
 The two suicide bombers then blew themselves up near the check-in point of American Airlines
 or phir malbic metro stesan par bhi joardaar dhamaakaa hua
 Baghdadi's Revenge This attack on the airport took place in the Departure Hall before the Security Check Point
 iske baad logon main bhagdad much gai
 Smoke started coming out of the main building
 blast ke turant baad hi airport ko khaali kara liya gaya
 The lines of fear were visible on every face
 har aankh main dard or dar kaa ehsaas tha
 There was chaos everywhere
 vahaan dhamaakaa us vakt hua he, jab paris main aatanki hamale kaa mukhya sandigdh saleh abdeslam giraftaar hua
 High alert was issued in the entire country after the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, an ISIS terrorist in Belgium
 belgium sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki yah karrwai aatankiyon ne badla lene ke liye kii he
 The fear of Baghdadi, who was alive, had never seen such a terrorist attack in its history
 jis belgium ko european sangh kaa centre bindu mana jaataa he, uski rajdhani par yah hamalaa bagdadi ke aatanki prakope or vajood ko dikhaa rahaa he
 After this attack, it was also clear that now Europe has come under the target of Baghdadi
 is hamale ke baad aatank ke sabase bade sargana abu bakar al bagdadi kii charchaa tej ho gai he
 Following the terrorist attack in Paris, the way France, Russia and other European countries attacked Baghdadi's bases, the terrorist world of Baghdadi began to collapse
 vah khud kahaan chipa baitha he, yah kisi ko nahin pataa
 But his awe is alive after the Belgian attack
 hamale kii vajah saleh kii giraftaar!paris par aatanki hamale ke chaar maheene baad belgium kii rajdhani brussels par hue aatanki hamalon ke baad sawaal uth rahaa he ki is hamale ke peeche kya vajah ho sakati he
 Somewhere the arrest of Paris attack suspect Saleh Abdeslam? So there is no reason for it
 chaar maheene pehle france kii rajdhani paris par hue aatanki hamale kaa mukhya sandigdh saleh abdeslam tha
 He was absconding since the attack
 lekin beete shuukravaar ko vah belgium main pakadaa gaya
 This arrest made Baghdadi's team restless
 bagdadi ko dar he ki kahin saleh unke saare raaj na khol de
 If this happens, all their polpets will open
 isiilie mana ja rahaa he ki yah aatanki hamalaa karaayaa gaya
 Belgian became the capital of terrorists, according to reports, after the terrorist attack in Paris last year, all the terrorists left France and reached Belgium
 or unhone vahiin panaah le rakhi thi
 Saleh Abdeslam, who is considered the main suspect in the Paris attack, was also born in Belgium
 aisa anumaan he ki belgium main apane aatanki thikaanon ko majboot karne ke liye aatankiyon ne in dhamaakon ko anjaam diya he
 Baghdadi showed the strength of Baghdadi, after the attack on Paris, Baghdadi was on the target of Europe, Russia and America
 bagdadi ke thikaanon par ek ke baad ek tabadatod hamale hue
 Baghdadi oil wells and other strategic bases in syria-libya-iraq were destroyed by European and Russian forces
 is dauraan yah khabar bhi ai ki ho saktaa he ki hamalon ke bich bagdadi khatm ho
 But with the terrorist attack on the Belgian capital, Baghdadi indicated that its terrorist existence is not over yet
 europe ko daraane kii sajeeshjis tarah se europea deshon ne bagdadi kii qamar todane main koi kasar nahin chodi, iske baad ho saktaa he ki bagdadi ne belgium ke bahaane samooche europe ko daraane kii sajeesh rachi ho
 The manner in which the bomb blasts were later shouting slogans in Arabic also suggests that they wanted to spread frenzy in the name of religion
 khud bagdadi bhi islam ke naam par hi duniya main khun kii holi khel rahaa he
 The commander of terror is Saleh Baggadi, the biggest terrorist of ISIS, and Saleh is his terrorist commander in Europe
 paris main hamale kaa mukhya sandigdh saleh hi tha, jo hamale ke baad bhaag gaya tha
 Five days before he was caught in Belgium, there was a terrorist attack on his capital
 wo 15 november 2015 kii manahuus raat thi, jab khubasurat paris shahar main bagdadi ke shaitanon ne sankadon laashen bicha di thi
 The terrorists were slaughtered in the musical hall of Bataklaan and the silence of death in the atmosphere was drenched by the music
 is aatanki hamale ko anjaam dene vaala saleh abdesalam bagdadi kaa hi gurga he
 His entire family is engulfed in a game of terror
 uske do bhaaiyon ko paris hamale main hi maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya tha
 Time to give a befitting reply a few hours after the Belgian attack, ISIS announced responsibility for the attack
 puri duniya yah sochakar dahal gai ki kya apane gurgey kii giraftaar se aatank kaa aakaa itnaa baukhala gaya ki usne bekasoor musafiron ko maut ke ghat utaarne kii thaan lee? europe iesas ke nishane par he or is baat kaa saboot he brussels se pehle paris par hamalaa
 The whole terror of destruction in Paris was created by this terrorist Saleh
 paris hamale main abdeslam ne logistic help di thi
 The same Volkswagen Polo car used in the attack was taken on rent
 usee ne ek fireworks shop se datonators bhi kharid the
 Now Saleh is captured by the Brussels police, but Baghdadi's revenge falls heavily on Belgium
 ab to chaahe jo ho duniya ko iesas ko munhtod jawaab dena hi hoga
 Today Netaji had to flag off the ashes of the Netaji of a big state
 saare jile or mandal str ke mukhya padaadhikariyon ko milakar kul 2019 kaaryakartaaon ko hi yatra main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 All the holiday workers were marching to pay homage to Netaji
 jaise hi netaji kii najar hari jhandi par padi, ve ghode kii tarah bidak gaye or tamtamaa kar bole, 'is jhandi se sampradayikta kii bu aati he
 We are responsible party leaders of a secular country
 is jhande kaa rang badla jaae
 Then we will give the green signal
 sori jhandi dikhaaenge
 'government babu said,' Sir's flag is always shown green
 iskaa color nahin badal sakate
 'leader said,' Color the color of this flag
 tum is vibhaag main nae aae ho kya? tumhen hamaare secretary kaa order nahin mila?jisamen hamane kahalwaya he ki ham jis cheez kaa bhi udghaatan karen uskaa rang safron hona chahie
 Didn't you see in the newspaper last week? We inaugurate Saffron Toilets? Before that, we have dedicated the Kesari morgues to the public
 netaji kii car or sofe kii seat cover bhi kesari rang ke the
 His spoon had crossed all limits
 netaji kaa toilet paper role bhi isi rang kaa banwaaya gaya tha
 Nobody wanted to lag behind in making an excellent introduction to patriotism and nationality
 ek ne to unka tambe kaa pikdaan bhi isi rashtriya rang main rangane kaa prastaav de daalaa tha
 Netaji's Peakadaan was running along with the Bone Kalash
 donon main antar karnaa mushkil tha
 Netaji was at the forefront leading the development of the country with an urn
 sabhi chele-chapatte kalash ko apane haathon main le krutharth hona chaahate the
 Occasionally, Netaji was arrested for spitting betel leaf, then the disciples were vying to get the urn
 is chhina-jhapati main kai baar pataa nahin chal paa rahaa tha ki koun sa asthi kalash he or koun sa pikdaan? lambii yatra ke baad jaise hi kalash toli ghat par pahunchaa, sidhiyon par safed chaadaren dekh netaji aag-babule ho uthe
 Someone explained, the head would come under the feet, so did not bring the Kesari sheet
 asthi visarjan kaa muhoort niklaa ja rahaa tha
 Netaji had Pekdaan in his hand instead of Kalash
 asthi kalash netaji ko do pikdaan idhar phenko kii awaajon kii gadabadi main netaji ne asthi kalash hi ganga main pravaahit kar diya
 Netaji's cheers were seen all around

 Shiv Sena, an ally in the central government, has attacked the Modi government in a terrorist attack on the Amarnath pilgrims
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne amarnath yatra par aatanki hamale ko lekar modi sarkaar par sawaal khadey hue kaha- yah durbhagyapurna he ki modi sarkaar ke hote hue aisa hua
 He said what happened to the claims made by the BJP
 raut ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ke saare daawey khokhale sabit ho gaye hai
 He questioned PM Modi's 56-inch chest
 saath hi sanjay raut ne bataaya ki notebandi or sargical strike kaa aatankwaad par koi asar nahin padataa he
 Shiv Sena strongly condemns this attack
 hamaare ection me kami dikh rahi he
 Now the time has come to take the right action
 desh kii janata ye chaahati he
 He said that this attack has happened on our government, on our pride
 isse pehle jab kabhi amarnath yatriyon par aisa hua us par shivasena pramukh bala sahib thakare ne chetaya tha
 Our government is not weak, but we need to show more courage
 sanjay raut ne do tatook kaha ki pakistan kii tedhi poonch ko sidhaa karnaa hoga
 At the same time, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu tweeted about the terrorist attack and said that attacking innocent Amarnath pilgrims is a cowardly act of terrorists
 yah chintajanak or chaunkaane vaala he
 He also said that my prayers are with the victims
 naidu ne kaha ki yah maanavtaa ke khilaaf he, main is ghatana kii ninda karata he
 The Jammu and Kashmir government has ordered an inquiry
 amarnath yatriyon par hua aatanki hamalagauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir main baba barphani ke darshan karne gaye shraddhaluon par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kar diya
 Around 8 on Monday night
 20 baje bike savaar aatankiyon ne bas par golibari kii, isamen 7 logon kii maut ho gai
 At the same time, 19 devotees were also injured
 yah hamalaa anantnag ke batengu kshetra main hua
 The dead include 5 women
 shraddhaluon par is hamale ke baad puure desh main gussa he, piem modi ne bhi is hamale kii kadi ninda kii
 He spoke to Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra and Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and assured all possible help
 manhagaai ke daur main bhi lutiuns kii dilli main coffee 5 rupye, chikan kari 50 rupye, fish kari 40 rupye or shaakaahaari thali 35 rupye main mil jaae to khaane vaale kaa jaayaka jarur dugana ho jayega
 But wait before you become happy
 
 
 ye sasta khaanaa aam aadmi ke liye nahin he
 Only a select few have access to it
 yahaan baat ho rahi he sansad kii canteen kii
 The food found here is much cheaper than the market
 aaie pehle sansad kii canteen main milane vaale khaane kii keemton par najar daal lee jaae
 Bread & Butter - 6 Ruchpati - 2 Ruchikan Curry - 50 Ruchikan Cutlet Plate - 41 Ruchikan Tandoori - 60 Rukoffi - 5 Rudosa Plain - 12 Rufish Curry - 40 Ruhaidarabadi Chicken Biryani - 65 Rumtan Curry - 45 Roubal Rice - 7 Rusoop - 14 Russand Ki Members of Parliament and their guests, former mps, officials of the Parliamentary Complex - other staff and visitors with valid passes can enjoy the cheap canteen lunch
 aam aadmi ko is saste khaane kii suvidha hasil nahin he lekin wo shikaayat nahin kar saktaa
 Because it is claimed that the canteen of Parliament is not subsidized by taxpayers' money and is run on the basis of 'no profit, no loss'
 bataa den ki varsh 2015 main sansad kii canteen main saste khaane kaa maamla khub surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 This happened after the fact that Parliament's canteen is subsidized up to 80 per cent on the cost of food
 us vakt loksabhaa main biju janata dal ke sadsy vaijayant jai pandas ne isi mudde par loksabhaa spikar ko chitthee likhi thi
 In the letter, he had said, 'when the government is asking the financially strong people to refund the LPG subsidy, then the mps should also withdraw the cheap food facilities provided by the subsidy in the canteen
 is kadam se logon main acha sandesh jayega or saansadon par unka bharosa bhi badhegaa
 After getting the letter of the MP, the Lok Sabha showed a positive attitude on it
 loksabhaa sachivalay ne 31 disambar 2015 ko is sambandh main ek bayaan jari kiya jisamen kaha gaya, ‘cameti kii report milane ke baad spikar ne kai faisle kiye hai, unamem sabase ahm he ki sansad kii canteen ab ‘no profit, no los’ ke aadhaar par kaam karegi
 The statement also said- 'the prices of various food items found in the Parliament canteen have been increased
 ab inaki laagat par jo asal kharch aayega, usee daam par inhen bechaa jayega
 The statement stated that this decision would come into force from 1 January 2016
 sansad sachivalay ke bayaan ke mutabik hi sansad kii canteen ke khaane par 1 janvari 2016 se sabsidi khatm kar di gai
 Also, the prices of food items were increased
 is faisle ke amal or asar ko jaanane ke liye india today ne artiai ke jariye loksabhaa se jaankaree maangi
 The reply received from the Lok Sabha Secretariat, which is a surprise, indicates that the subsidy on the food of the canteen of Parliament was never abolished
 aaie 2013-14 se najar daalate hai ki beete 5 vitt varsh main sansad kii canteen ko kitni-kitni sabsidi di gai
 2012-13– 12
 52 karod ru2013-14- 14
 09 crores Rs
 2014-15-15
 85 karod ru2015-16- 15
 97 crore Rs2016-17 15
 40 karod ruyahaan gaur karne vaali baat he ki vitt varsh 2015-16 main sabsidi khatm karne ke faisle vaale saal main 9 maheene tak sabsidi rahi or 3 maheene bina sabsidi ke rahe
 Total 15 in this financial year
 97 karod rupye sabsidi di gai
 15 even when Parliament canteen was not to be subsidized in the next fiscal year 2016-17
 40 karod rupye sabsidi di gai
 This subsidy was just Rs 57 lakh less than the previous fiscal 2015-16

 bharat main kai logon ke gharon main aapako aisi dher sari chijen mil jaaengi jinka istemaal mahilaayein kisi na kisi anokhe dhang se karti aa rahi hai
 One such case has emerged from Kerala
 yahaan ek patni ne apane pati ke passport kaa istemaal phone diarectory or rashan ke saamaan kaa hisaab likhane ke liye kar diya
 The video of passport made in the phone directory is going viral on social media and Whatsapp these days
 is video main mahila ne passport ke pannon par rishtedaaron ke kaam, mobile number yahaan tak ki rashan kaa hisaab tak likh diya he
 However, in the video, it is being said that the passport of the husband on which the woman has written the mobile number and ration information, that passport was old and was of no use
 isliye passport ko mahila ne phone number or rashan kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye istemaal kar liya
 It is known that there is a perception among people that making passports is a very complicated task
 kyonki kisi bhi vyakti ko passport banane ke liye kai tarah ke documents dene padate hai
 After this a passport is made
 bataa den ki bharat sarkaar ne passport banane ke niyamon ko behad aasaan kar diya he
 The government has reduced the number of attachments from 15 to 9
 iskaa matlab yah he ki documentation kam hoga
 Handeriton passports are banned

 ' tabarez ansaari mob linching cese main hataai gai hatya kii dharapostmortem report main dil kaa daura padane se hui tabarez kii mautpulice ne 11 aropiyon ke khilaaf hataae hatya ke aaropaparijanon kii maang, maamle kii ho sibiai jaanchdeshbhar main surkhiyon main rahe tabarez ansaari mob linching cese ne nayaa mode liya he
 On June 17 this year, Tabrez Ansari was brutally beaten up by a mob on charges of alleged bank robbery
 buree tarah ghayal tabarez ne 22 june ko dam tod diya tha
 Police arrested 11 accused and registered a case under Section 302 of IPC
 tabarez ansaari se jude maamle main visra report kaa shiddat se intazaar ho rahaa tha
 But when this report came, a surprising result was revealed
 postmortem report ke mutabik tabarez kii maut tanaav or dil ke daure kii vajah se hui
 What happened to Tabrez, a resident of Kadamdih village in Seraikela district of Jharkhand on the night of 17 June, is all in the public domain and was covered by media across the country
 aarope he ki jab bheed tabarez kii pitayee kar rahi thi to usase ‘jai shri ram’ or ‘jai hanuman’ bolne ke liye kaha gaya
 a video had also surfaced in which one could see how Tabrez was beaten with a pillar
 soochna milane par agle din subah police maukey par pahunchi
 Tabrez was admitted to Sadar Hospital for medical examination before being sent to judicial custody on charges of theft
 tabarez kii haalat bigadane ke baad 22 june ko usne dam tod diya
 Based on the conclusion of the post mortem report, the police have dropped murder charges against all the 11 accused
 police kaa kahana he ki jab maut kii vajah dil kaa daura he to ham kaise dhara 302 ke aaropon main aage bad sakate hai
 SP s Karthik of Seraikela Kharsawan said that section 302 has been changed to section 304 of culpable homicide
 dhara 304 main bhi aaajeevan karawas kaa praavdhaan he
 But the difference is that the accused will no longer be sentenced to be hanged
 haalanki aropiyon par baaki aarope badastoor jari he
 The removal of section 302 does not mean that he is acquitted
 hoicourt main practice karne vaale or is cese main piiel daakhil karne vaale rajeev kumaar kehete hai ki police kaa shuru se hi aropiyon ke khilaaf naram ravaiya rahaa
 This is not the first time that such an incident occurred in Seraikela
 isse pehle bhi jharkhand main mob linching ke 15 se zyada maamle report ho chuke hai
 The Supreme Court has also spoken of being strict in the incidents of mob lynching
 har koi jaanata he ki agar kisi kii is had tak pitayee kii jaae ki uskaa bachanaa mushkil ho jaae to ise iradatan hatya hi mana jayega
 The Jharkhand High Court had sought a detailed report on the June 17 incident related to Tabrez Ansari and then the anti-mobilizing rally on July 5
 court ne sarkaar ko duty main kotahi kii khaamiyon ko lekar chetaya tha
 After this, in the reply submitted by the government to the court, it was said that the above action was taken against the concerned officials including the civil surgeon
 haalanki tabrej kii patni shahista parveen or anya parivaar waalon ne is maamle main sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 He says that Tabrez was brutally murdered and the police lifted Section 302 against the accused, so how can they expect justice
 jharkhand main netaa vipaksh hemanth sorain ne report ko lekar sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He also questioned the viscera report
 sorain ne kaha, “jab bhukh se koi maut hoti he to ye sarkaar kahati he ki beemaari kii vajah se maut hui
 When a person commits suicide due to governmental neglect, the government issues a statement and explains the cause of suicide as a personal problem
 or ab jab mob linching kii vajah se maut hui to sarkaar iske peeche dil kaa daura bataa rahi he
 What more can be expected from this government

" isaki prakriya natural he
 The BJP emerged when the Congress was in power

 In the last few days, Gujarat has seen caste politics and Maharashtra has witnessed caste violence, so what do you think the BJP will suffer from this? is par shah ne kaha ki agar aap is samasya kii jad main jaaenge tab aapako lagegaa ki ise dur karne ke liye lanbaa sangharsh karnaa hoga
 It is a natural process, but we have to win it for the country and for democracy

 Regarding his victory in 2019, Shah said, "certainly, we are ready for this election
 2014 main jab ham satta main aae the to har koi bhavishya ko lekar ashavan tha

 simaaen bhi asurakshit thi

 At that time, the home loan of the common man was 10-12 percent, which has been increased to 8-9 percent today
 " unhone kai myanon main desh ko aage badhata hua dikhaane kii koshish kii
 Asked to 'win by a big margin' in Uttar Pradesh or elsewhere, Shah said, "I am confident that we will be able to do so
" bade desh main kai tarah kii ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai, isliye kuch bhi kah paanaa aasaan nahin he, lekin agar aaj chunaav ho jaae to ham ode bahumat ke saath satta main lautenge

 Senaratne read a statement by Cabinet Secretary s Abasinghe, stating that the President had not said anything against RAW about the plot of his assassination
 unhone kaha ki 16 oktober 2018 ko raashtrapati sachivalay main cabinet baithak ke dauraan charchaa kiye gaye vishyon par prakashit evam prasaarit khabaron par cabinet mantriyon ke pramukh ke taur par raashtrapati ne dhyaan diya
 It was emphasized that those reports are completely untrue
 senaratne ne kaha ki srilanka main bharat sarkaar yaa bhartiya companiyon dwaara kriyanvit kii jane vaali buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaon se jud koi cabinet patr us baithak kaa hissaa nahin tha
 The President did not give details about how India was involved in this conspiracy
 khabar main kaha gaya tha ki sirisena china sanchalit colombo international container terminal (siisiti) ke paas terminal viksit karne ke liye bharat ko ijaajat dene ke khilaaf he
 Sirisena had earlier said that the southern port of Hambantota had already been leased to China
 aise main colombo bandargah main bharat ko shaamil karnaa kisi aakasmik sthiti main srilanka ke hit main nahin hoga
 However, a cabinet spokesperson said on Wednesday that Sirisena has not opposed the project of developing the eastern port terminal with India

 Who will be the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, it will become clear before the Lok Sabha elections
 party ne tay kiya he ki vah chunaav main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa naam saamne rakhkar maidan main utregi

 First Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then LK Advani, but now the problem of BJP is that it has faces only
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki is daud main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa naam sabase aage he
 BJP president Nitin Gadkari created a ruckus by saying that the BJP will decide the name of its prime ministerial candidate only after the Lok Sabha elections, but a section of the party has been strongly against it
 unka maananaa he ki chunaav maidan main utarane ke liye ek cheharaa jaruri he
 The comments ab tay hua he ki agle saal march main bijepi pradhanmantri pad ke apane ummidavaar kaa naam bataa sakati he

 chaahe nitin gadakari is pad ke liye aadha darjan naam gina rahe hon, lekin sutron ke mutabik is daud main narendra modi kaa naam hi sabase aage he
 The BJP started debuting in the elections by keeping the face in front

 Tarlochan Singh said that Akali Dal MLA Valtoha had used caste words for him and in the same reaction he threw his shoe out and threw it, but he does not know who felt the shoe
 tarlochan ko vidhansabha se bhi nange pair baahar aana padaa
 Virsa Singh was sitting far away from Bikram Singh, while the minister of the Akali government, Bikram Singh Majithia, termed it as a desperation of the Congress and said that he and the Punjab government were not going to be disturbed by these antics

 The ministers of the akali-bjp government made it clear that they have not used anti-dalit and casteist words for any Congress MLA and the Congress has no issues, so they are making such excuses

 At the same time, all the leaders of the Congress stood with their mlas and said that if the Akali Dal minister would abuse them and say caste-related words, would they remain silent
 ye ection kaa riection tha
 At the same time, Rajkumar Verka, Congress MLA and vice-chairman of SC-ST commission, said that he did not hear the people of Akali Dal saying any racist words with his ears, but Congress mlas come from the Dalit class and if they wrote to the commission If we give a complaint, after getting the investigation of the case, an action will definitely be taken from the commission

 ' Whether Priyanka Gandhi will emerge as a new center of power within the Congress, the question is bound to arise
 kyonki priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main aupchaarik intry us samay hui he jab congress ne haal hi main teen rajyon main chunaav jitkar sarkaar banaai he or lekin uttar pradesh main sapa or bisaspi gathbandhan se alag sabhi siton main chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuki he
 Priyanka Gandhi, who has been campaigning in Rae Bareli and Amethi since 2004, is not that easy in Uttar Pradesh
 saal 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main priyanka gandhi ne raibareli or amethi main gali-gali prachaar kiya tha
 But the result did not come in favor of Congress at all
 raibareli kii 5 vidhansabha siten, sareni, banchhrawa, harchandpur, sareni, oonchaahar se congress haar gai thi
 Whereas in this election SP had won four seats from here
 isi tarah se amethi kii chaar vidhansabha siton main tiloi, salon, gauriganj, amethi, jagadishpur main congress ko sirf 2 siton main hi jeet mili thi
 At the same time, for the 2014 assembly elections, Priyanka Gandhi campaigned fiercely in Rae Bareli and Amethi in this election
 donon hi siton par congress kii jeet hui thi
 However, even if Priyanka Gandhi did not enter the campaign for these seats, the Congress would have won
 kyonki amethi se rahul gandhi or raibareli se sonia gandhi pratyaashee thim
 It is definitely worth noting that Smriti Irani had given a fair fight to Rahul Gandhi in Amethi and this time it is also believed that BJP will field Smriti Irani from Amethi

 His presence in Rae Bareli and Amethi in the Lok Sabha elections 2014 did not affect the surrounding seats

 At the same time, talk about the 2017 assembly elections, in the 10 assembly seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress had only 2 seats in the account
 haalanki is chunaav main priyanka gandhi chunaav ke liye nahin ai thim
 Prashant Kishore, who was strategizing for the Congress at that time, also advised Priyanka Gandhi to make a face in Uttar Pradesh

 Also, he did not mention the government of former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot even once and failed to count the work done by him
 rahul ne apane bhaashan kaa 5 fisadi hissaa bhi rajasthan ko nahin diya
 He only tried to make Rajasthan tadak in his speech on lack of electricity, employment to youth
 agar rahul gandhi chaahate to rajasthan main nikali bhartiyon or unamem hui gadabadi, manaregaa ke bajet main katautee, aparaadh kaa badhata graph, doctor hadtaal, kisaan karj maafee, sampradayik tanaav, aarakshan, kharaab kanoon vyavastha or kai buniyadi suvidhaon ko lekar vasundhara sarkaar ko gher sakate the
 During this, he said, 'as soon as the Congress party wins elections in 2019, we will change these 5 different levels of Gabbar Singh tax and give a GST, we will also put diesel and petrol in GST, which will reduce inflation

 chunaav ayog ke 42 pej ke aadesh ko padhane se saaf pataa chalata he ki mulaayam singh yadav ke paksh ne apana homework thik se nahin kiya or ayog ke saamne puure dastauez nahin diye
 Experts were saying that if the Election Commission had the power to plead the arguments of both the parties then it could have seized the cycle election trail now and secure its decision for later
 lekin chunaav ayog ne apane faisle main saaf likhaa he ki ayog kii ore se baar-baar maange jane ke baavjood mulaayam kheme ne apane samarthan main vidhayakon yaa saansadon kii chitthee nahin di
 Not only this, he did not even mention the names of those whose affidavits were given by Akhilesh in his support and which Mulayam suspected were fake
 (padhein : ramgopal yadav ne kaha-congress ke saath gathbandhan sambhav) Para 36 of the verdict that the Commission has given reads in detail that the Akhilesh Yadav camp gave a letter of support to 205 mlas out of 228, 56 mlcs out of 68 and 15 out of 24 mps
 iske alaava akhilesh kii ore se 46 main se 28 neshnal akxcutive sadasyon or 5731 main se 4400 rashtriya pratinidhiyon ke halafname saunpe gaye, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki vah akhilesh ke kheme ke saath hai
 The Election Commission, referring to para 15 of the symbol order, has stated that the one who has legislative and organizational strength in its favor is considered the real contender
 akhilesh kii ore se die gaye in shapathpatron se unka daawa majboot hua
 But the Mulayam Singh Yadav camp, on the contrary, kept saying that Netaji (mulayam) still holds the party
 tippaniyan The Election Commission has clearly stated in paras 37, 38 and 39 of its order that no documents were given in support of Mulayam Singh Yadav, while the Commission gave him time till 9 January
 aise main mulaayam kaa paksh kamjor hua or akhilesh ke vakeelon ne 13 janvari ko chunaav ayog main bahes ke dauraan isko mudda banaaya
 The Commission has also said that Mulayam Singh Yadav questioned the veracity of the affidavits submitted by Akhilesh Yadav but never satisfied the Commission about its objection
 ayog ne apane aadesh ke para 39 main likhaa he ki baar-baar avasar diye jane ke baavjood na to mulaayam singh yadav ne koi halafanama diya or na hi kisi saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam bataaya, jiske shapathpatr ko vah farzi maanate hon
 According to the commission, Mulayam kept saying that there has been no dissolution in the party and he is the surveyor of the party
 jaahir he sirf ye daleel kaaphi nahin thi or chunaav chihn akhilesh ko de diya gaya
 But the Election Commission has clearly stated in its decision that despite repeated demands from the Commission, the Mulayam camp did not give a letter to mlas or mps in support
 yahi nahin, unhone un logon ke naam bhi nahin bataae, jinke shapathpatr akhilesh ne apane samarthan main die the or jin par mulaayam ko shaq tha ki wo farji hai
 (read: Ram Gopal Yadav said - possible alliance with Congress) ayog ne jo faisla sunaaya he, uske para 36 main vistaar se likhaa he ki akhilesh yadav ke kheme ne 228 main se 205 vidhayakon, 68 main se 56 emelsi or 24 main se 15 saansadon ke samarthan kii chitthee di
 Apart from this, the affidavits of 28 National Executive Members out of 46 and 4400 National Representatives out of 5731 were submitted by Akhilesh stating that he is with Akhilesh's camp
 nirvachan ayog ne simbal order ke para 15 kaa zikr karte huye kaha he ki jiske paksh main vidhaayi or santhnik takat he, use hi asli daavedaar mana jaataa he
 These affidavits from Akhilesh strengthened his claim
 lekin iske ulat mulaayam singh yadav kheme kii ore se sirf yahi kaha jaataa rahaa ki party par ab bhi netaji (mulaayam) kii pakad he
 The comments chunaav ayog ne apane order ke para 37, 38 or 39 main saaf likhaa he ki mulaayam singh yadav kii ore se apane samarthan main koi dastauez nahin diye gayi, jabaki ayog ne unhen 9 janvari tak kaa vakt diya tha
 In such a situation, Mulayam's side weakened and Akhilesh's lawyers made it a point during a debate in the Election Commission on 13 January
 ayog ne yah bhi kaha he ki mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh yadav kii ore se jamaa kiye gayi shapathpatron kii satyata par to sawaal uthaaye lekin ayog ko apni aapatti ko lekar kabhi santusht nahin kiya
 The Commission has written in para 39 of its order that despite repeated opportunities neither Mulayam Singh Yadav gave any affidavit nor named any MP or MLA whose affidavit he deems to be fake
 ayog ke mutabik mulaayam yahi kehete rahe ki party main koi vighatan nahin hua he or vahi party ke sarvesarva hai
 Obviously, this argument was not enough and the election symbol was given to Akhilesh
 (padhein : ramgopal yadav ne kaha-congress ke saath gathbandhan sambhav) Para 36 of the verdict that the Commission has given reads in detail that the Akhilesh Yadav camp gave a letter of support to 205 mlas out of 228, 56 mlcs out of 68 and 15 out of 24 mps

 Former president of Delhi Congress and former MP JP Agarwal said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that even though the exit poll has shown the Congress in third place, the election plans will be shocking and the Congress will win as its Mayor in all three corporations
 jepi agarwal kaa kahana he ki eczit pole vishwasaneey nahin hote
 Earlier, the media had also told the DMK government in Tamil Nadu in the exit poll

 Questioning the exit poll, JP Aggarwal said that how can he tell the opinion of entire Delhi by taking the opinion of a few thousand people in a crore population
 jepi agarwal kaa maananaa he ki congress teenon emsidi main jeet rahi he
 In the three mcds, the Mayor will be the Congress only
 congress main emsidi chunaav se thik pehle kalah ko bhi jepi ne bebuniyaad bataaya or kaha ki congress party ne achche se chunaav ladaa
 JP said that he himself held many meetings, Sheila Dixit held a meeting in Gandhi Nagar
 sabhi ne apane-apane daayre ke andar rah kar kaam kiya
 It is wrong for you to say that the Congress was scattered
 arvinder singh lavali or barkhaa shukla singh ke bijepi jwine karne par bhi jepi ne apni baat rakhi or kaha ki jo log party se nikal kar bijepi main gaye hai, agar wo aarope laga rahe hai ki party main unki nahin suni gai to ye unka nijee maamla he
 If they said that the Congress is not listening to the poor or is not paying attention to the people living in slums, then i agree that the accusation is correct, but they have left the party and moved to another party, then they are accusing the Congress Nothing to do
 haalanki jepi ne lavali or barkhaa ke bijepi main jane ko dukhad bhi bataaya
 Votes were low because people disappointed with BJP-AAP
 
 
 kam voting hone par bhi jepi agarwal ne bijepi or aam aadmi party ko isaki vajah bataaya
 According to JP, the voting was reduced because people did not turn out to vote for BJP and AAP
 jepi ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ne do saal main kya kiya
 
 
 Made false promises and did nothing
 
 
 vahi haal bijepi kaa he
 
 
 In 10 years, these people have given the illusion of MCD

 There is another controversial article written on this side in his mouthpiece 'saamana', which is already involved in the controversies on Muslim rights
 mukhpatr ke sampadak or party netaa sanjay raut ne apane nae lekh main sirf un logon ko matdaan kaa adhikaar dene kii baat kahi he jo parivaar niyojan karavaate hai
 Sanjay Raut has written in his article, 'the politics of the country is always busy in cheering only 14 crore Muslims
 agar ye desh hinduon kaa nahin to is desh main dharmanirpekshata kii aad main mughalon kaa raaj bhi nahin laane diya jayega
 Muslims are not enemies of this country, but Muslim vote bank politics is hurting the country
 desh main sirf un logon ko matdaan kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie jo parivaar niyojan karavaate hai
 Not only this, Raut has also commented strongly on AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi questioning Najma Heptulla and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 raut ne likhaa he ki mukhtaar abbaas nakvi or najam hepatulla donon vande maataram gaate hai
 It is worth mentioning that in another article published earlier on 12 April, Rautam has advocated and demanded the voting of franchise from Muslims
 haalanki baad main is ore vivaad gahraane par unhone apane lekh se you-turn le liya or kaha ki media ne unki baton ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya
 Commenting on Raut's article, Awaisi had asked whether the Shiv Sena would wrest the electorate from BJP mps Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Najma Heptulla
 kya likhaa tha paheleisse pehle raut ne ‘saamana’ ke ek lekh main yah likhakar siyaasi tufaan machaa diya tha ki raajnneetik dalon dwaara muslimon kaa votbank ke rup main upyog band karne ke liye muslimon kaa matadhikaar khatm kar dena chahie
 Raut had said in the editorial article, 'votebank politics is being done in the name of fighting injustice done to Muslims
 unki shaikshik or swasthya sthiti kaa upyog raajnneeti ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Congress first did this politics, but now every other person describes himself as secular
 'unhone kaha tha, 'agar muslimon kaa prayog keval is tarah kii raajnneeti ke liye kiya ja rahaa he to unka kabhi vikaas nahin ho saktaa
 As long as Muslims are used for vote bank politics, there will be no future for Muslims and hence Balasaheb (shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray) once said to withdraw franchise from Muslims
 jo unhone kaha tha vah sahi he
 Sanjay Raut later said that after coming under the attack of critics in u-turnabad, 'I did not write that the franchise should be withdrawn from the Muslims
 maine sirf itnaa kaha ki agar unhen vot dene kii anumati nahin di jaae to muslimon kaa prayog raajnneetik avasarvadita ke liye nahin kiya jayega
 He added, 'I did not say that Muslims should be deprived of their franchise
 media ko din ke liye kuch khabar chahie thi or unhone mere bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala
 ' loksabhaa chunaav ke chhathwein charan ke liye ravivaar ko saat rajyon kii 59 siton par matdaan hue

 We need to help all those who make our country secular and safe to prepare a good good future for our loved ones
 ' lekin is twit ke saath paragway ke jhande kaa chinh lagane kii vajah se trobers ke nishane par aa gaye
 During this, Robert Vadra was criticized by many
 twitor par ghirne ke baad wadra ne apana purana twit hataa liya or nae sire se twit kiya
 Earlier, Robert Vadra voted with Priyanka Gandhi
