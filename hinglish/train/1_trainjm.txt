 banaras hindu uniwarsity (BHU) se ‘hindu’ or aligarh muslim uniwarsity (AMU) se ‘muslim’ shabdon ko hataaya janaa chahie kyonki ye donon vishvavidhyalayon ke dharmanirpeksh charitra ko nahin darshaate
 This recommendation has been made by a committee of the University Grants Commission (UGC)
 haalanki kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne saaf kiya he ki BHU se 'hindu' or AMU se 'muslim' shabd hataane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 In Ahmedabad on Monday, Javadekar even said that a committee of UGC has made a recommendation which is not a part of the mandate of that committee
 vahiin kendriya alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne is sifarish kaa virodh karte hue ise khaarij kar diya he
 The UGC committee was constituted to examine the alleged irregularities in the 10 central universities
 samiti kii siforishein aligarh muslim uniwarsity kii audit report main di gai hai
 a member of the committee recommended the removal of the term hindu-muslim, on the condition of anonymity, stating that universities run on the funds of the Center are secular institutions and such words (hindu, Muslim) do not reflect their character
 samiti ke sadsy ke mutabik donon vishvavidhyalayon ke naam aligarh uniwarsity or banaras uniwarsity kiye ja sakate hai
 Apart from BHU and AMU, other universities whose alleged irregularities were investigated by the UGC committee include Allahabad University, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna University (uttarakhand), Central University of Jharkhand, Central University of Jammu, Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University Wardha, University of There are Tripura and Hari Singh Gaur University (madhya Pradesh)
 nakvi ne prastaav kaa kiya viropulpsankhyak kalyaan mantrimukhtaar abbaas nakvine aligarh muslim uniwarsity or banaras hindu uniwarsity ke naam ko badale jane ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya he
 Naqvi said that having these names does not matter and it is not that by changing these names they will become more secular
 nakvi ne kaha ki tamaam shiksha santhaan aise hai jinke naam main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai yaa jain dharm judaa hua he lekin is se koi fark nahin padataa
 The matter is under consideration of the Supreme Court, Congress leader Anand Sharma said on this issue that it is not known why the case of AMU and BHU is being taken up
 is mudde ko pehle hi suljhaayaa ja chukaa he
 Mohammed Asif Siddiqui, a member of the PRO department of Aligarh Muslim University, has questioned on what basis the UGC committee has made this recommendation
 siddiki ke mutabik unka kaam vittiya maamalon ko dekhnaa he yaa uniwarsity ke buniyadi charitra ko dekhnaa
 AMU is a secular institution and there is no bias of any kind
 jahaan tak iske charitra (darje) kaa maamla he to wo supreme court ke vichaaradhin he
 Will the university's identity be lost? The students and professors of AMU also believe that removing the words 'muslim' from AMU and 'hindu' from BHU will destroy the identity of these two universities
 puri duniya main log in donon vishvavidhyalayon ko AMU or BHU ke naamon se hi jaanate hai
 Unity in diversity is the identity of the country
 In Varanasi, Professor Rajendra Singh of BHU said that he does not think that Muslim words from AMU and Hindu words from BHU will be removed
 pro
 Singh said that 'hindu' is the beauty of BHU and 'muslim' is the beauty of AMU
 aisa nahin hota ki BHU main muslim chaatro or AMU main hindu chaatro ko daakhila nahin miltaa
 The beauty of this country lies in 'unity in diversity'
 pro singh ne kaha ki jo varshon se in vishvavidhyalayon kii pahchaan rahaa he, use chhedaa nahin janaa chahie

 He said that now the Delhi government will not need to send its files to the Lieutenant Governor
 up rajyapal ko cabinet ke faisle ko maananaa hi hoga
 The government will do the transfer and posting
 a big victory for the people of Delhi
 
 
 a big victory for democracy
 
 
 — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)july 4, 2018unhone kaha kiup rajyapalke adngebaaji ke chalate janata ke kaam latake hue the
 Now the possibility of arbitrariness of the Deputy Governor is over and the Delhi government will be able to do its work properly
 unhone kaha ki isse pehle maamle main faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne kaha ki up rajyapal dilli main faisla lene ke liye swatantra nahin hai
 LG will have to act as per the advice of the cabinet
 is bich unhone yah bhi kaha ki purna rajya ke darje par andolan jari rahegaa
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is not possible for Delhi to get full statehood
 supreme court ke faisle se saaf he ki dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar hi rajya ko chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 After the decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also expressed happiness by tweeting that he has said that democracy has won in Delhi
 maamle main supreme court ke vakil or aam aadmi party ke netaa somnath bharti ne kaha, 'supreme court ke faisle se saaf ho gaya he ki sanvaidhanik adhikaar dilli sarkaar ko hi die gaye hai
 These rights have been restored
 samvidhan kahata he ki police, jameen or kanoon vyavastha ko chhodkar dilli sarkaar sabhi maamalon par faisle legi
 Till now, the works which used to be obstructed, are now banned
 'shila dikshit boleen- milakar karne se banegi batvahin, congress netaa or dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne kaha, 'kaam chaahe up rajyapal ke niyantran main aae yaa phir mukhyamantri ke niyantran main
 But have to work together
 varanaa matbhed kii sthiti main kaam nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court has reiterated the provisions in the Constitution
 up rajyapal or mukhyamantri ke pad jimmedaari ke hai
 When there was a government in Delhi, there were differences, but we worked together
 kabhi up rajyapal jhuk jate the or kabhi ham jhuk jate the
 'BJP said- Kejriwal's jhatka: This decision has been described by BJP as a setback for the Kejriwal government
 maamle main bijepi netaa vijendra gupta kaa kahana he ki supreme court ne hoicourt ke faisle par hi muhar lagaai he
 It has once again become clear that the Deputy Governor has complete control over the matter of police, land and law and order
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki up rajyapal khud aadesh nahin nikaalte hai
 They only approve the decision of the Delhi government
 is faisle main yahi kaha gaya he ki up rajyapal hi dilli sarkaar ke faisle par muhar lagaayenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party is misleading people by calling this decision its victory

 — Vijay Sampla (@vijaysamplabjp)april 23, 2019bataa den ki film abhinayta sani deol ke bijepi main shaamil hone or punjab ke gurdaspur se loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke elaan ke baad akali dal ke netaaon main khushi kii lahar he
 According to sources, the senior leadership of the Akali Dal is assuming that Sunny Deol's election from Gurdaspur will have an impact on the three Lok Sabha seats - Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Hoshiarpur - coming from the akali-bjp alliance in Punjab to bjp's quota
 BJP will benefit here
 saath hi akali dal kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki unke khate main aane vaali punjab kii 10 loksabhaa siton par bhi sani deol apana prabhaav chodenge
 3 out of these 10 seats are from where Sunny Deol has family ties
 isse akali dal ke netaa maanakar chal rahe hai ki uskaa phayda unhen milegaa
 Deol is the ancestral home of the family in Sahnewal, Ludhiana
 saahanewaal ilaaka fatehgarh sahib loksabhaa kshetra se bhi najadik he
 Fatehgarh Sahib Lok Sabha seat is in the account of Akali Dal
 iske alaava punjab kii sangrur loksabhaa seat se bhi akali dal kaa ummidavaar maidan main he, vahaan par banbhora sani deol kaa nanka (mata kaa maayka) parivaar sambandh rakhata he
 In such a situation, the Akali Dal hopes that Sunny Deol will leave its influence not only on the 3 Lok Sabha seats of bjp's account but also in the Sangrur, Ludhiana and Fatehgarh Sahib Lok Sabha seats which come to his account

 In response, the Indian team had lost five wickets for 49 runs
 barish prabhavit is test main vah 98 ran par ol out ho gai
 Due to incessant rains the result of that test could not come out and India survived the White Wash 0-4

 15–17 August 2014, India again suffered an innings defeat like the Manchester Test in this last Test of the england-oval Five Test series against England

 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne aashcharya jataayaa he ki congress netaa ko us vakt anaaj sadata hua nahin dikhaa, jab vah ek garib mahila kalavati kii jhonpadi main gayi the
 It is worth mentioning that after visiting the house of this widow of a farmer of Vidarbha region, Rahul got the attention of the country by telling his story in Parliament in the year 2008
 gadakari ne kaha he, ‘‘rajkumaar (rahul gandhi ke bare main) kalavati ke ghar main khaanaa khate hai, to kya vah anaaj ko sadane or kisaanon kii durdasha nahin dekh sakate
 However, Tiwari mentioned that grain rot and lack of it is a serious issue
 unhone kaha, ‘‘pichley 60 saal main godaam kii kshamta badhaayi jaani chahie thi, lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 We did not give it priority

 china seemaa ke kareeb samrik lihaaj se behad jaruri or praathamikta vaali kai railway line ke nirmaan ke liye bharat sarkaar fund nahin juta paa rahi
 The project was approved by the cabinet two years ago, but about 2
 1 lakh karod rupee ke baari-bharkam fund kii jarurat ko dekhte hue ise shuru kar paanaa philhal mushkil lag rahaa he
 In December 2015, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) approved the construction of four priority railway lines under the project, as reported by the Indian Express
 iske liye railway dwaara philhal final lokation survey (FLS) kiya ja rahaa he
 These include 378 km long misamari-tenga-tawang line, 498 km long bilaspur-manali-leh line, 227 km long pasighat-teju-rupai line and 249 km North lakhimpur-bame-silapathar railway line
 asal main raksha mantralay ne janvari 2010 mencymavarti ilaakon menkul 28 rail margon ke nirmaan ke liye 'saidhantik manjuuri' di thi
 Of these, 14 railways were designated as strategic railways and then four of them as 'primary' railways
 14 railmargon ke liye praarambhik survey ho chukaa he, lekin in rashtriya project par aage koi kaam nahin hua he
 This was discussed several times in the Empowered Committee for Border Infrastructure (ECBI) headed by the Cabinet Secretary, but nothing concrete has been done in this matter yet
 raksha mantralay ne kendriya sthaayee samanvay dhaanche (CPCF) main bhi is masale ko uthaaya he
 This committee also has representatives from the Ministry of Railways
 praarambhik anumaanon ke anusaar, samrik rup se behad mahatvapurn chaar rail linon ke nirmaan par kareeb 2
 It will cost Rs 1 lakh crore
 is laagat kii vyavastha kahaan se ho, iske liye vitt mantralay main vyay sachiv ke netritv main ek stearing kamity banaai gai he
 Due to the delay in their construction, it is also feared that the cost will increase further
 abhi sirf survey ke liye 345 karod kaa mila fundsarkaari sutron kaa kahana he ki railway ne in linon ke liye khud kaa fund lagane se inkaar kar diya he, kyonki ye yatri yaa maal haada kisi bhi lihaaj se phaayde kaa sauda nahin he
 344 in the year 2016-17, for the four-line FLS survey by the Ministry of Defense after CCS gave priority to their construction
 84 karod rupee kaa bajet manjuur kiya tha
 This railway line will beat China, in fact all these lines are going to be built in a very high and inaccessible area on the Himalayan Mountains
 isliye inako banane ke liye kaaphi vyapak study, survey karne kii jarurat he or in par laagat bhi kaaphi zyada aegi
 The bilaspur-manali-leh corridor will become the world's highest railroad and will overtake the qinghai-tibet rail route in China

 According to the report, there was no attempt by the Vice Chancellor or the Proctorial Board to communicate with the students
 yahi nahin ve chaatro ke gusse kaa akalan karne main bhi vifal rahe
 On the 21st, the security personnel took no action on the complaint of molestation after exposing the insensitivity of the security personnel and on the contrary they made inappropriate remarks on the students
 yani chaatraon kaa yah aarope sahi he ki surakshakarmi ne peedita se kaha ki aakhir vah shaam 6 baje ke baad baahar kyon nikali
 Let me tell you here that the Chief Proctor kept saying continuously that the security personnel did not comment on the victim
 suraksha main kotahiprashasan ke tamaam daavon ke vipareet 22 taarikh ko jab chatraayen sadakon par utrin or vah pradarshan par baith gaye tab bhi uchit suraksha vyavastha nahin kii gai
 All the doors of the dialogue were done by the administration, Bandariport said that the administration had many opportunities to communicate with the girl students between 36 to 48 hours, but there was no initiative from them
 chaatr ikattha hote gaye lekin BHU prashasan ne aisi koi bhi koshish nahin kii jisase bheed kam ho
 At the same time, different student union leaders also went on to join this movement

 The Aam Aadmi Party today accused the BJP of distributing a 'fake' letter in which Arvind Kejriwal has expressed thanks to Bahubali leader Mukhtar Ansari of the Qaumi Ekta Dal for allegedly not contesting the Lok Sabha elections

 While warning of 'legal action' for defamation, AAP said that fake letters have been written on various letter heads instead
 vartmaan main agra jail main band kaumi ekta dal ke ansaari mau kshetra se vidhayak hai
 He contested the last Lok Sabha election as a BSP candidate and lost to bjp's Murli Manohar Joshi by a narrow margin at that time
 isse pehle ansaari ne kaha tha ki vah dobaaraa loksabhaa chunaav ladenge, lekin baad main unhone apni yojana tyaag di
 His party said that Ansari has decided not to contest the election, so as to prevent secular votes from being split and he would support the strongest candidate against Narendra Modi
 tabhi se kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki ansaari kejariwal kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 The AAP, however, later said that it would not take Ansari's support

 duusari ore baat karen bihar kii to argedy ke saath congress, araspi, ham or viipi party or sipiai hai
 In this, RJD will contest 20 seats, Congress 9 seats, RLSP 5 seats, VIP 3 seats and CPI 1 seats
 lekin khabaren thim ki bihar congress ke netaa 9 hi siten milane se naaraaz the
 On the other hand, tension within the RJD itself is increasing
 vahiin bihar main is samay sabase charchit seat begusarai main argedy ne sipiai ke pratyaashee kanhaiya kumaar ko samarthan nahin diya he or apane pratyaashee tanwir hasan ko utaar diya he jabaki bijepi ne kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ko utaara he

 As of now, no decision has been made yet
 punjab, haryana or goa main aam aadmi party kii acchhee-khaasi paith ban chuki he or congress ke saath uskaa gathbandhan bijepi ke liye mushkil ho sakati he

 har shaks ke adhikaron raksha karne main sakshamsijeai thakur ne kaha ki main ek aise santhaan kaa netritv kar rahaa hum jo kanoon kaa shashan sunishchit karata he
 As long as there is law and there is independence of the judiciary, i think we are able to protect the rights of every section of society

 isse logon main sahi sandesh jayega
 This is not a sacrifice, but an attempt to encourage people

 agar aapane hollywood kii popular film da dark nite dekhi he to yaad hoga ki kaise bruce wain apane powerful system seoup se puure gutham shahar ke sabhi cellular divaais ko microphone main tabdeel kar dete hai
 a similar theory has always been that apps installed in smartphones are listening to you by turning your smartphone into a microphone
 aisa karke companiyaan targated vigyaapan bhi detii hai
 Research firm Dave Koffnes of Northeastern University of America has done research on this topic for almost a year
 unhone kansperesi theory par shodh kiya he ki smartfones chupake se microphone on karke baatcheet record karte hai or zyada targated vigyaapan dete hai
 Dave is also a Professor of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University
 dev ne yah shodh ek saal main ise puraa kiya he or is dauraan unhone android ke 17 hajaar popular eps kii jaanch kii he
 This research has revealed that companies do not need to convert smartphones into microphones to listen to your conversations
 kyonki aisa na karke bhi wo targated vigyaapan dene main sakasham hai
 We have interviewed these Dave Koffnes and tried to know what is the logic behind the voice recording theory by turning the smartphone into a microphone
 Q: kya ham is theory ko nakaar sakate hai ki companiyaan cellphone ke jariye aapaki baatcheet record nahin kar rahi hai?dev: puri tarah se to nahin, lekin hamane android ke hajaaron popularaps ko jaancha he jisamen aisi koi batasamne nikal kar nahin ai he
 We also cannot rule out the possibility that other apps are recording your conversations
 ye bhi sambhav he ki hamane jin eps kii testing kii wo pehle aisa karte hon
 But based on this research, we hope that it is not common for apps to record your conversations
 Q: aapane 17 hajaar eps kii testing kii he
 Based on your investigation, what are the things that are annoying for the people who want privacy
 dev: alag log alag-alag tareeke kii privesi samasya se darate hai
 i have found that screen recording is more dangerous than recording conversations or recording video or images with camera access
 kyonki screen recording se aapke bare main zyada jaankaree milti he ki aap kaise bihev karte hai
 No permission is required for screen recording nor does the user get its notification
 Q: is tarah kii monitering se bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie? kaise sicyor rahaa ja saktaa he?dev: short main kahen to is samasya kaa samaadhaan ke liye koi silver bullate nahin he
 The first thing a user can do is review the apps that are installed in the smartphone and see what permission they are taking
 agar jarurat ke nahin hai to inhen hataa den
 If an app is asking for more permissions than required, then withdraw the permission from it
 haalanki screen recording li ko rokna mushkil he, kyonki iske liye eps ko kisi parmishan kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 Our team is preparing a software that will detect such activity
 philhal ye sabhi ke liye uplabdh nahin he, lekin baad main ham iskaa dayera badhayenge
 Q: According to your research, which app platform is more secure in this kind of recording and tracking
 play store yaa ap store?dev: is sawaal ke jawaab ke liye hamaare paas data nahin he
 However, in earlier studies, we found that leaks of all types occur on all platforms
 ek antar ye tha ki Android eps ke mukaable ios eps zyada lokation li karte hai
 However, this data is from three years ago, so we cannot say anything about the current result

 If even qualified teachers are filled in fifty percent seats, then the pattern of higher education will change in the coming days and if there is only political restoration, then higher education will be divided

 centre sarkaar ne algaavvaadi netaa yaccin malik kii aguwai vaale sanghathan jammu kashmir libration front yani JKLF par pratibandh laga diya he
 This ban is imposed under the anti-terrorism Act
 is sanghathan kaa itihaas bhi purana he
 This organization was founded by two people together
 jisamen pehla naam tha makabool bhat or doosraa tha amanaullah khan
 The only objective of this organization was independence of Kashmir
 koun tha makabool bhatus vakt bharat angrejon kaa gulam tha or kashmir ek aaazaad riyasat
 Then in February 1938 Maqbool Bhat was born in Trahgam in Kupwara district
 makabool jab 11 baras kaa tha, to uski maa kaa nidhan ho gaya
 He was good at writing studies
 vakt gujarata rahaa
 Maqbool completed his History and Political Science from St
 Stephens College, Srinagar
 iske baad aage kii padhai ke liye makabool ne pakistan kii peshawar uniwarsity main daakhila le liya
 There Maqbool met Shair Ahmed Faraz
 faraj se mulaakaat ke baad makabool ko shaayari bha gai
 a few days later Maqbool started working in an Urdu newspaper there
 jammu-kashmir libration front kaa janmpeshawar se padhai puri karne ke baad makabool bhat pakistan se britain ke shahar birmingham ja pahunchaa
 He met some other people there
 iske baad sanghathan banane kii yojana banaai gai
 And while implementing the same plan, Maqbool formed the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front in collaboration with Amanullah Khan
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui
 Maqbool Bhat formed another wing of this organization
 jise jammu-kashmir neshnal libration front (JKLNF) kaa naam diya gaya
 This was the wing of the JKLF, which later fought face to face with the Indian Army and the Armed Forces
 kashmir lautaa makabool bhatbharat ab aaazaad tha
 Kashmir was merged with India
 lihaaja kai saal baad 1966 main makabool bhat bharat aa gaya
 As soon as he came here, he started raising the voice of liberating Kashmir
 wo baagi ban chukaa tha
 Was speaking against India
 wo apane saath duusare algavvaadi vichaaron vaale yuvaaon ko jodne laga
 The people of JKLNF, the wing of JKLF, were also working on its agenda
 wo har vakt kashmir kii aazaadee raag alaapta tha
 Maqbool's arrest in India Meanwhile, one day Maqbool and JKLNF confronted the police
 golibari hui or makabool kaa ek khaas saathi aurangzeb encounter main maaraa gaya
 Also a police officer named Amar Chand was also martyred
 iske baad police ne amarchand kii hatya ke aarope main makabool bhat or uske ek anya saathi kaala khan ko giraftaar kar liya
 The case was registered
 tafteesh chal rahi thi
 The investigation accused Maqbool of being an agent of the enemy country
 us par mukadmaa chalaae jane ke baad use maut kii sajaa sunai gai
 After sentencing, Maqbool had said in court that he was not an agent of the enemy
 lekin bharat ke colonial mindset kaa dushman he
 Maqbool Bhat had confessed his crime in Maqbool court
 wo srinagar jail main band tha
 But one day in 1968, suddenly Maqbool escaped by constructing a tunnel in the jail with the help of his two prisoner companions
 baad main police ko pataa chalaa ki makabool bhat jail se bhagkar pakistan chalaa gaya he
 Maqbool had hatched a conspiracy to hijack the plane
 In January 1971, the Indian Airlines Fokker F27 aircraft aircraft 'ganga' was hijacked
 plane hijac karne vaale kashmiri yuvak the
 Who were identified as Hashim Qureshi and Ashraf Bhat
 wo donon vimaan ko hijank kar lahore ja pahunche
 Passengers and crew members were evacuated from the plane
 or phir us plane ko aag laga di gai
 Indian security agencies called Maqbool Bhat the mastermind of this hijacking
 phir aise giraftaar hua tha makaboolis ghatana ke baad bharat ne pakistan sarkaar se makabool bhat ko giraftaar karne kii maang kii
 Neither did Pakistan arrest Maqbool Bhat but did not hand over India
 phir 1974 main makabool bhat ko pakistan sarkaar ne reeha kar diya
 After this Maqbool Bhat came to India after staying in Pakistan for some time
 use is baat andaja nahin tha ki bhartiya agenciyaan uske liye ghaat lagaae baithi hai
 As soon as he came to India he was arrested
 tihaad jail main makabool ko di gai thi fonsijexlef ke sargana makabool bhat ko pehle bharat main sajaa sunai ja chuki thi
 Therefore, after he was caught, the matter became hot again
 makabool bhat ne tatkaaleen raashtrapati gyani gel singh ke yahaan apni sajaa ke khilaaf dayaa yachika daayar kii
 But after the petition was filed, JKLF militants killed Ravindra Mahatre, an Indian diplomat in Birmingham, demanding the release of Maqbool
 maamla or ulajh gaya
 The result was that President Giani Zail Singh rejected the mercy petition of Maqbool Bhat
 11 farvari 1984 ko dilli kii tihaad jail main makabool bhat ko faansee par lataka diya gaya
 It is said that his body was buried in Tihar itself
 aage chalakar jammu-kashmir libration front kaa sah sansthaapak makabool bhat kai varshon tak kashmir ke alagavaadiyon kii prerana bana rahaa
 The JKLF people do not consider India and Pakistan
 wo keval kashmir kii baat karte hai or khud ko nesanalist bataate hai
