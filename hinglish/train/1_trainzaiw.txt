 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, the two bigwigs of Uttar Pradesh's politics, were seen quite viral when they forgot the decades-old rivalry and came to the same stage at the Mainpuri rally
 dushmani bhulaakar donon netaaon ne ab uttar pradesh main piem modi ko rokane kii koshish karne kii ek tarah se kasam khai he
 Mulayam Singh's son and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has played a big role in bringing these two leaders together
 samaajawaadee party kii digital cell kaa daawa he ki in donon netaaon kii sanyukt raily ne utyub main saare record tod die hai
 But in spite of all this, it is not clear how much message of unity between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati to their cadres and voters who are opposed to each other, seems to be nothing special
 is puure ghatnakram ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki puraane or manze hue netaa mulaayam singh yadav apane bete ke pyaar or na chaahate hue bhi mayawati ke sammaan main ek hi manch par aane ke liye raji ho gaye
 24 years ago today, only Mulayam Singh Yadav activists attacked Mayawati in the guest house
 tab se chali aa rahi 'bheeshan dushmani' mayawati or mulaayam ke bete ke bich hue mahagathbandhan ke baad bhi donon ke bich khatm nahin hui thi
 Let us tell you that this confrontation between the two took advantage of the opponents
 duusari ore bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko bhi laga ki donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke liye bada khatra ban jayega
 In view of this, he engaged 'amar Singh Uncle', his uncle Shivpal Yadav, who has become the ax of Akhilesh Yadav and his new party to spoil the game of Grand Alliance
 vahiin khabar yah bhi he ki amit shah ne bijepi iti cell se jude logon ko us video ko bhi khub viral karne ke liye kaha gaya he jisamen kathith rup se akhilesh yadav apane pita par haath uthaate dikhaai de rahe hai
 However, the veracity of the video has not been confirmed
 lekin phir bhi iskaa iskaa jamkar prachaar kiye jane kaa aadesh he
 Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav persuaded his father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, for a joint rally, after reporting a good performance of the Grand Alliance in the first phase of voting
 yahaan yah bhi baat gaur karne vaali he ki mulaayam singh yadav is gathbandhan ke paksh main nahin the or aksar saarvajanik rup se isaki kai baar ninda bhi kii
 Along with this, inside, together with Shivpal, conspired against its decision
 vahiin aisa lag rahaa tha ki mayawati ke saamne har mudde par akhilesh yadav ko khud kai kadam peeche khinch chuke hai or mayawati bhi unki jamkar tarif kar raheen thim
 There was also a lot of discussion about the honor being given to 'bua' by Akhilesh Yadav
 akhilesh yadav ne bayaan diya, 'mayawati kii izzat ab unki izzat he'
 With this, he now also mentions Akash Anand, the most beloved of Mayawati, in his speeches
 akhilesh yadav kii is vyavhaar-kushalta kaa yah phayda hua ki mayawati bhi mulaayam singh yadav ke saath khushi-khushi sanyukt raily karne ke liye raji ho gayi
 Analysts believed that the BJP would benefit in Uttar Pradesh in 7 phases
 lekin vastav main mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan kaa zyada phayda mil saktaa he, kyonki donon kii koshish he sabhi bade ilaakon main sanyukt kii jaae
 At his rally in Mainpuri, Mulayam Singh Yadav, popular among his voters, said that the Samajwadi Party should respect Mayawati as she stands with us in our bad times
 vahiin jawaab main mayawati ne bhi piem modi kii tulana main mulaayam singh yadav kii khub tarif kii
 Mulayam Singh Yadav got emotional on hearing this and thanked him
 mayawati ne kaha, 'aapke paas acha betaa he, aapane usko achche se bada kiya he, vah unke liye'tiger balm' kii tarah he
 'mayawati's words were as if she is healing the wounds of the guesthouse scandal
 jab 1995 main unke upar sapa ke logon ne hamalaa kar diya tha or unako khud ko ek kamare main band karnaa padaa
 After this incident, Mulayam and Mayawati vowed not to see each other's face
 agar main bijepi ke ek online saportron ke manapsand 'bernol movement' kii tarah kahen to akhilesh yadav apane un dushmano ke liye'tiger balm'kii tarah hai jinhen bernol kii jarurat he' a day after the targeted attacks, the security committee meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet is likely to review the situation along the international border with Pakistan and the Line of Control today (friday)

 It has been revealed in this conversation that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is expecting surrender, not compromise with Muslims
 agar ye baat sahi he to is baatcheet kaa hashr sochaa ja saktaa he
 Ejaz Arshad Kasmeen, a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board, who met Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in Bengaluru on 6 October, said that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is talking about arbitration, but is not presenting any model of agreement
 muslim personal lau board ne saaf kar diya he ki koi model saamne pesh karen, tabhi baatcheet aage bad sakegi
 Kasmi said that Ravi Shankar is also meeting people from the Muslim community who have no direct connection with the Ayodhya case
 itnaa hi nahin shiya vakf board or rashtriya muslim manch ke logon se milakar shrishri ravishankar ye bhoomika bana rahe hai ki muslim samudaay vivaadit jagah se apana daawa chhod de or iske baadale kahin or masjid banane kii jagah le le
 This is not a compromise, but a model of surrender
 muslim personal lau board ke sadsy kamaal faruki ne kaha ki shri shri ravishankarmuslim samudaay se ramamandirke liye masjid kii jameen gift chaahate hai
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had earlier met the Muslim community for mediation
 us samay bhi unki manshaa yahi thi or aaj bhi yahi he
 Farooqui said- We told them clearly that Babri Masjid is not any goods or personal property of anyone, which should be gifted
 muslim vakf act ke mutabik vakf sampatti ko na kisi ko bechaa ja saktaa he or na hi gift diya ja saktaa he
 Even then Ravi Shankar wants gifts from the Muslim community, which is impossible
 faruki ne kaha ki maine unase kaha ki muslim paksh is baat par ek mat he ki supreme court kaa jo bhi faisla hoga use ham maanenge or aap bhi maniye
 Babri Masjid Action Committee convenor Zafaryab Jilani said that it is impossible if Sri Sri Ravi Shankar wants the Muslim parties to give up their rights to the mosque
 muslim personal lau board se abhi tak shrishri ravishankar ne koi sampark nahin kiya he
 Please tell if they have a model
 muslim dharmaguruon dwaara shri shri kii pahal ko lekar baar baar kahi ja rahi sarender kii baat ram mandir mudde par pakshakaar nirmohi akhaade ke mahant dinendra das ke bayaan se bhi majboot hoti he
 In the revelations of Aaj Tak, Das has said that from Rs 1 crore to Rs 20 crore can be given to the Sunni Waqf Board if they agree for Ram temple

 The opposition's uproar over the Modi government's decision on demonetisation continues
 haalanki, is masale par vipaksh ke puri tarah ekajute nahin hone se centre sarkaar par dabaav bana paanaa inke liye mushkil ho rahaa he
 The JD (U) chief Nitish Kumar's support of demonetisation is not coming to the Congress, a partner of the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 notebandi par modi sarkaar ko jor-shor se gherne main juty congress ne 2019 chunaav ke liye pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar kaa mudda oochaal diya he
 The Congress said that there will be only one candidate for the post of Prime Minister from the Grand Alliance and it will not be Nitish Kumar but Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 congress kaa maananaa he ki notebandi par centre sarkaar ke faisle kaa samarthan kar nitish kumaar 2019 ke aam chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apni swatantra chhavi gadhane ke firaaq main hai
 When there were demonstrations against demonetisation on Monday, the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the Left Front participated vigorously but JDU President and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar made it clear that they would not be part of the protest against demonetisation
 haalanki isse pehle sansad main vipaksh kii ore se ho rahe virodh main jadyu netaa or nitish se pehle party adhyaksh rahe sharad yadav notebandi ke khilaaf khadey rahe
 The Congress strategy is to strengthen Rahul's candidature for the post of Prime Minister in the upcoming general elections by making Rahul Gandhi a vocal face of the Modi government's protest against demonetisation
 aise main nitish kumaar kii ore se notebandi kaa samarthan kiye jane se congress ko tagada jhatka laga he
 The Congress believes that Nitish Kumar has taken this stance on demonetisation in view of the Lok Sabha elections
 nitish apni is siyaasi chaal se kshetreey takaton yaa tisare morche kaa mukhiya banane kii koshish main hai yaa chunaav baad gathbandhan kii sthiti main bijepi ke saath khadey hone kii firaaq main hai
 But the Congress also believes that in the Lok Sabha elections, an alliance for the voters of Bihar cannot have two leaders - Rahul Gandhi and Nitish Kumar
 kaha ja rahaa he ki lalu prasad ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko phone kar nitish kii shikaayat bhi kii he
 Sources believe that because everything is not going well between Nitish and Lalu, Nitish wants to distance himself from Lalu on the issue of governance
 shuru se kiya notebandi kaa samarthananithish kumaar ne shuru se hi notebandi kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki isse blike mani or bhrashtachar par ankush lagane main madad milegi
 Due to this attitude of Nitish Kumar, such things started happening in the political corridor that Nitish, who broke away from BJP before the Bihar elections, is getting closer to PM Modi
 ramvilas paswan sareekhe endie ke kuch netaaon ne to nitish kumaar dore daalane shuru kar die
 Paswan offered Nitish to join the NDA, saying that everything between him and Lalu Prasad was not good
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya ki bihar main gathbandhan kii sarkaar zyada din nahin chalegi
 However, Nitish Kumar alleged at a meeting of party mlas on Monday that a conspiracy was being hatched to end his political career after the statement on demonetisation
 rabari ke bayaan se machaa bavalnotbandi ko lekar lalu or nitish ke bich talkh hote rishton ke bich bihar kii purv siem rabari devi ne ek bayaan dekar aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya
 He made controversial remarks about BJP leader Sushil Modi, who was the deputy CM in the Nitish government
 haalanki jab rabari kaa bayaan tivi channelon ke camaron main kaid ho gaya to unhen apni galati kaa ahsaas hua
 He tried to cover up the statement by calling it a joke
 lekin salbhar pehle bihar main sattashin hue mahagathbandhan main sabakuch thik he, yah kahana mushkil he
 Nitish and Lalu met on Tuesday evening
 iske baad lalu kii taraf se yah bayaan saamne aayaa ki wo notebandi kaa samarthan karte hai lekin isse ho rahi aam janata ko pareshaani kii phikr mahagathbandhan ko he
 Lalu also said that confusion is being spread in Bihar on behalf of the opposition i

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi aajkal uttar pradesh kii yatra par hai
 They are taking out a farmers journey here and through this, they are trying to restore their party on the board of politics
 is pradesh vyapee yatra kii shuruyaat unhone purvanchal ke devaria jile se kii or ant dilli kii jameen par hoga
 Talking about the farmer, when Rahul started his journey from Deoria, he went to the temple of Dudhanath Baba of Rudrapur to seek blessings
 devaria se rahul gorakhpur gaye
 On Friday, he reached Ayodhya via Faizabad and had a darshan at the famous Hanumangarhi temple here and then met Mahant Gyanadas in a closed room
 hanumangadhi se baahar nikalate rahul ke maathe par tilak tha or ankhon main chamak
 He proceeded from there without saying anything
 darasal, wo kuch bolkar kisi duusare sandesh main funsana nahin chaahate the
 Tilak's message was on Rahul's face
 yah sandesh ek sampradaay vishesh ke liye bhi he or ek jati vishesh ke liye bhi
 Rahul is actually playing a double card here
 unki yatra to kisaanon par kendrit he lekin nigahen agadon ke vot par he
 Particularly, Rahul and the Congress Party are leaving no stone unturned to woo the Brahmin vote bank
 congress party pehle hi dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit kouttar pradeshke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye apana pratyaashee ghoshit kar chuki he
 Sheila Dixit is a Brahmin and daughter-in-law of a distinguished Brahmin family of the state
 jis dauraan rahul panditon kii dahalij maane jane vaale in jilon main yatra kar rahe the or mandir main mattha tekte aage bad rahe the, shila dikshit mirzapur main maa vindhyavasini mandir main aashirwad lene pahunchi hui thim
 It has not happened suddenly that the Congress leadership has been awakened
 in chhaviyon main ek sandesh he or wo sandesh spasht rup se brahmanon ke liye he
 To understand the caste's tilakarahul and this Brahmin love of Congress, one has to understand the current political circumstances of the state
 2014 kii loksabhaa main 73 saansadon ke saath soobe se itihaas rachane vaali bhartiya janata party kii vidhansabha main sthiti dayaneey he
 They have only 10 percent seats in the state with 403 assembly seats
 bijepi agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main is vanvaas ko khatm karnaa chaahati he
 For this, Dalit and Muslim votes are negligible in the caste assessment based on bjp's mathematics
 yadavon ke bhi voton main bhaajapa kisi badi sendhamari kii sthiti main he, aisa kahana atishyokti hi hoga
 The basis of the BJP is the vote of the forward
 aisa hi bihar main tha or aisa hi uttar pradesh main bhi
 The rest is expected to depend on votes from other backward and most backward
 aise main agar kisi party ko lagata he ki use bijepi kaa rath rokna he to use sabase pehle unke kor votbank yani agadon ke bich upasthiti ko kamjor karnaa hoga
 The Congress is preparing its election strategy according to this assessment
 agadon main brahman ek lambey samay se congress kaa paaramparik voter rahaa he
 As the Congress weakened, it continued to shift base
 lekin is baar shila dikshit kaa turup khelkar congress ne brahmanon ko waapas rijhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 If the Congress is successful in getting the votes of the Brahmins, then it will increase the chances of strengthening the BJP and repeat the message from Uttar Pradesh that the Congress was able to deliver as part of the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 2017 kii ladaai lard rahi congress or uske abhiyaan prabandhak prashanth kishor kii nazar darasal 2019 ke chunaav par he or 2017 kaa uttar pradesh chunaav us disha main khaasaa nirnaayak he
 Look at it in this way that the Congress party led by the UPA government during the 10 years was more focused on the workers and landless, that party is talking more about the farmers today
 darasal, sankhya main kam hote hue bhi jameenon par adhikaar agadon ke paas zyada he
 In Uttar Pradesh, Brahmins, Thakurs and Yadavas own considerable land
 jis karjamaafee kaa naaraa congress upi main doharaa rahi he, wo agadon ko zyadalabhanvitakaregaa, pichhadon, daliton ko kam
 Rahul is sitting with the farmers by cot
 lekin maathe par tilak he or nazaron main apana purana janaadhar
 This is certainly a matter of concern for the BJP
 mumbai main ek videshi mahila par ek vyakti ne blade se hamalaa kiya or uskaa mahangaa mobile phone chhinakar faraar ho gaya
 The great thing is that this incident happened in the female coach of the local train
 mahila ke chehre or haath par chotein bhi ai hai
 However, after the complaint, the police has started investigating, but it is suspected that the attacker will be addicted to drugs
 sisitivi camera kii footage kii madad se aaropee tak pahunchane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In the female coach of a local train in Mumbai, an unknown person attacked an American citizen and snatched her mobile phone
 police ne bataaya ki yah ghatana shaam ko pashchimi railway ke marine lines or charni road steshnon ke bich us samay hui, jab ek agyaat vyakti mahila coach main aayaa or america naagarik mishael mark kaa bag chhinane kii koshish kii
 When the woman protested, the person attacked her and escaped by snatching her phone
 anya yatri peedita ko mumbai central thane main adhikariyon ke paas lekar gaye
 Meanwhile, a senior official of the Government Railway Police (GRP) alleged that the Railway Protection Force constable and the station master refused to help the woman and asked her to go to the GRP officer
 mahila ke haath or chehre par maamuli chotein ai hai
 The GRP officer said that he would take the matter to higher officials
 agyaat vyakti ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he or mahila ko upachaar ke baad aspataal se chuttee de di gai
 At present, the Supreme Court has not stayed in the matter of giving 10 percent reservation to the general class
 supreme court is par kal yani buudhvaar ko bhi sunwaayee jari rakhega
 The Supreme Court said that we will first decide whether to send the matter to the Constitution Bench or not? The day the court gives its verdict in this regard, the same day the court will decide when to start the hearing on the interim order (interim stay)
 isse pehle maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne kaha tha ki agali sunwaayee main is baat par vichaar kiya jayega ki 124wein samvidhan sansodhan par roak lagaai jaae yaa nahin
 The apex court had refused to stay the law or ordered to refer the matter to a larger bench
 court ne centre sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 In fact, the petition challenges the 124th amendment to the Supreme Court
 Supreme Court will continue hearing arguments tomorrow on whether the pleas challenging the Constitution Amendment, that gives 10% reservation in jobs & education for economically weaker section of general category, could be heard by Constitution Bench

 inke mutabik aarakshan kaa aadhaar aarthik nahin ho saktaa
 According to the petition, the Bill is against the basic principle of granting reservation to the Constitution, it violates the limit of 50% along with giving 10% reservation to the general class
 gauratlab he ki yah vidheyak sarkari naukari or shikshan sansthaanon main savarnon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan detaa he
 Significantly, before the Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government, which came on the backfoot on the SC / ST amendment bill, tried to convince the angry upper castes by running the stakes of reservation on economic grounds

 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar considers mongoose auspicious
 24 saal baad unhone is raaj ko kholaa he

 After that runs started coming and then if he got mongoose, we would have got a wicket

 Do not have to
 pehle party ke ek vidhayak ne raashtrapati ko chitthee likhakar guzarish kii ki modi kii raily ke maddenjar ve apana bihar daura taal den
 If this was not enough, then senior party leader and vice president CP Thakur has also become a part of this campaign
 unhone ne bhi pranab mukherjee se bihar daure ke kaarykram badalane kii maang kii he
 Actually, Narendra Modi has a rally in Patna on 27 October
 vahiin, raashtrapati pranab mukherjee bhi 26 or 27 oktober ko patna main hai
 Now the BJP has accused the Chief Minister of the state that Nitish Kumar is using all kinds of tactics to stop Modi's hunkar rally
 is babat bijepi vidhayak nitin naveen ne to raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko chittathi likh daali or vinati kii ki modi ke raily kemddenjar wo apana daura taal den
 Nitin Naveen said till date, 'I have written a letter to the President to postpone my visit to Patna so that there will be no problem in Narendra Modi's rally
 'unki chitthee ko lekar party asahaj sthiti main funs gai he
 However, CP Thakur has also increased difficulties by joining this campaign
 unki bhi pranab mukherjee se yahi guzarish he ki modi kii raily kii khatir wo apana daura taal den
 However, he also slammed party MLA Nitin Naveen for writing a letter to the President
 unhone kaha ki agar nitin naveen ko raashtrapati ke bihar daure par apni baat rakhni thi to wo sahi rasta chunate
 He used to talk to the party high command first
 susheel modi ne kaha, 'main maukhik taur par raashtrapati ji se guzarish karuunga ki ve apana patna daura taalkar nayaa kaarykram banaaen
 i reject Nitin Naveen's letter
 unhen ye mudda party haikaman ke saamne uthaanaa chahie tha
 'it is clear that the BJP does not want to leave any stone unturned to make Namo's rally in Patna a success, even if the President has to ask for it
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki bijepi kii is guzarish par pranab mukherjee kya karte hai
 The appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not seem to have any effect on the Hindu organizations and their extremist activities are continuing
 uttar pradesh ke sitapur main hindu mahasabha ab mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse kaa mandir banavaane ja rahi he
 The English newspaper 'the Times of India' reported this

 Remember that Gandhi was shot on this day
 akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha ne somvaar ko yah ghoshnaa kii
 Earlier the Hindu Mahasabha was about to get Godse's statue installed, but now it is adamant on building a temple
 sitapur uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu se kareeb 100 kilometre dur he
 The newspaper has written that land for this temple has also been purchased in Para village of Sidhauli
 khabar ke mutabik, mandir main rakhane ke liye godse kii asthiyon kaa kalash pune se sitapur laayaa jayega
 Hindu Mahasabha spokesman Sharad Gupta told the newspaper that this Kalash of Godse will be ordered through the Kalash Yatra
 ye kalash godse kii rishtedaar himani saavarkar ke paas he
 Gandhi's mortal body, Sharad Gupta, said that the BJP is not showing interest in Hindu issues like the Congress, so the Hindu Mahasabha has decided to build Godse's temple
 gauratlab he ki bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ne bhi godse ko deshbhakt bataaya tha, lekin vivaad ke baad apana bayaan waapas le liya tha

 However, it is not yet clear what kind of conditions will apply for CBDT to tap someone's phone

 The committee, in its recommendation, said that the CBDT should be excluded from the list of agencies that have the right to phone tapping as tax evasion cases are not civil and national security related issues but civil matters only

 The foreign hand may be behind the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 aisa daawa supreme court main daakhil ek yachika main kiya gaya he
 According to the petition, Narayan Dattatreya Apte was hanged on November 15, 1949 along with Nathuram Godse, the main murderer in the Mahatma Gandhi assassination
 yachika main daawa kiya gaya he ki apte kii pahchaan andeh ke ghere main he
 This is the reason that the petition has requested to re-investigate the Mahatma Gandhi murder case
 vivaadit he aapte kii pahachaanapako bataa den kimahatma gandhihatyakand kii puri sajeesh kaa pataa lagane ke liye 1966 main gathit justise jeel kapur ayog ne apni report main kaha tha ki apte bhartiya vaayu sena main rah chukaa tha
 However, the former Defense Minister informed Dr
 Pankaj Phadnis, who filed this petition, that "no information has been received anywhere about Narayan Dattatreya Apte being an Air Force officer
" purv raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne saat janvari, 2016 ko shodhakarta or sheersh adaalat main yachika daayar karne vaale pankaj ko yah jawaab diya tha
 In such a situation, Phadnis, a researcher and trustee of Abhinav Bharat, has questioned the investigation of the Mahatma Gandhi assassination, saying that this is one of the biggest cases of lip-granddaughter in history
 unhone yachika ke saath tatkaaleen raksha mantri or ab goa ke mukhyamantri parrikar kaa patr bhi sanlagn kiya he
 The petitioner has argued that such information proves the involvement of the alleged foreign hand in the assassination of the Father of the Nation on January 30, 1948
 nahin mili airforce officer hone kii jaankariyachika ke saath die gaye purv raksha mantrimanohar parrikarke letters main likhaa he ki maine maamle kii jaanch karaayi
 i have been informed that the matter was referred to various agencies within the Air Force, Division of the Ministry of Defense and AA based in HCI, UK
 haalanki narayan dattatrey apte se sambandhit koi bhi jaankaree sambandhit koi ricard nahin mili he
 The History Cell of the Ministry of Defense has also contacted the National Archives, Central Secretariat Library and private papers of the Mahatma Gandhi murder case have also been studied
 ’’ patr main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki 1943-46 ke liye bharat ke rajptr (vaayu prakoshth) kii bhi khojbin kii gayi, lekin uske bhartiya vaayu sena kaa adhikari hone ke bare main koi bhi jaankaree kahin nahin mili
 Again, the investigation Fadnis has argued in the Supreme Court, requesting a re-investigation into the Gandhi murder case on the basis of Parrikar's letter that in such a situation there is sufficient basis to rely on the fact that Apte was operative of the British Force 136 
 isaki pushti is maamle main aage jaanch ke baad hi ho sakati he

 In this petition, along with putting a question mark on the 'story of three bullets' in the Gandhi assassination, the question was also raised whether anyone other than Nathuram Godse had fired the fourth bullet? In this massacre, the court sentenced Godse and Apte to death on 10 February 1949
 vahiin vinayak damodar saavarkar ko saakshyon kii kami ke kaaran andeh kaa laabh de diya gaya tha
 Both were hanged in Ambala jail on November 15, 1949, after confirmation of the death sentence of Godse and Apte on 21 June 1949 by the East Punjab High Court

 dilli main nijee skulon kii fees badhotaree kaa maamla tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 After the increase in fees in different schools, the pressure of action is increasing on the government, so there have been reports of protests of angry parents after the increase in fees from many places, after which the opposition raised fees But Kejriwal has started to surround the government
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne aarope lagaaya he ki ek taraf to sarkaar nijee skulon par lagaam lagane kii baat karti he, privet skulon kii munafkhori ko khatm karne kaa daawa karti he, lekin pichley raste se unhen fees badhaane kii manjuuri bhi de detii he
 The Delhi government is adopting a double approach in the case of private schools and the latest case of increase in fees is the result of this duplication of the government
 manoj tiwari ne schuli bacchon ke maa-baap ko skulon kii taraf se mil rahe fees badhotaree noticeon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki har bachche ke abhibhavakon ko 10 se 40 hazaar rupye tak kii atirikt fees vasuuli ke notice mili hai, yahi nahin skool is badi hui fees ko vasuulne ke liye abhibhavakon par dabaav bana rahe hai
 The BJP alleges that this campaign of schools is a result of the government's approval in which the government has given permission to increase the fees as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Scale Commission
 vipaksh aropalaga rahaa he ki sarkaar ne pichley darvaaze se skulon ko bacchon ke maa-baap se pichhali taarikh se badi hui fees kaa arier vasuulne kii chhot bhi de di he, isiilie skulon kii taraf se notice die ja rahe hai
 Tiwari said that Tomnis Sisodianiji on one hand pats himself on the back by claiming to stop arbitrary schools, but now the fees are being collected from previous dates, then why is the government adopting such an attitude and people are being misled, because without Private schools cannot decide to increase the fees of the government's consent

 He will stop contacting Punjab from Delhi, he said that the Punjab government is constantly ignoring the biggest court
 aise halaat main ham rashtriya rajdhani dilli se punjab kaa sampark kaat denge
 They will not be allowed to reach Delhi via Haryana
 ham unke raaston ko roak denge
 Terrorism has increased in the Punjab and Haryana governments over the canal-state-satluj-yamuna link canal in punjab-haryana
 punjab main bijepi akali dal ke saath sarkaar main shaamil he to haryana main uski hi sarkaar he
 The Punjab government has passed a resolution in the Assembly raising its voice against the construction of the canal
 vahiin haryana sarkaar ne ise supreme court ke nirdeshon ke khilaaf bataakar ninda kii he
 This was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fifth address from the ramparts of the Red Fort and the last address of the current Modi government
 desh chaar saal se zyaada samyavadhi kaa unka kaarykaal dekh chukaa he or isse pehle chaar baar bataur pradhanmantri wo bharat kii janata ko laal kile ke pracheer se sambodhit kar chuke the
 In the first year i
e
 in 2014, when the Prime Minister along with his first non-congress majority government stood at this fort to address the country on the day of independence, there was a vision in it
 yah drushti thi unki sankalpana ke bharat kii or un vaadon ke kriyanvayan kii jo unhone logon se chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kiye the
 In this speech, he hinted at taking the country forward in a different way and bringing about an aggressive change
 baad ke bhaashanon main wo vipaksh par prahaar karte, apane kaamkaaj ko ginate or logon ko sidhe prabhavit karne vaale muddon par bolte nazar aae
 This has rarely happened during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure so far when he did not appear in the election campaign posture
 iske peeche vajah bhi thi
 Elections of states in the country continued to unfold and the style and content of their speeches kept coming in front of people
 lekin laal kile se paanchvaan sambodhan pradhanmantri modi ke liye khaasaa myne rakhata tha
 The Prime Minister's address this year was from counting his achievements to accounting for new works and programs
 aarakshan par paarit bill se bhaashan kii shuruyaat karke modi ne apane puure sambodhan ko 2013 banaam 2018 banaae rakhaa
 Read it
 
 
 2013 vs 2018: modi bole- vahi jameen, vahi aasmaan, kaam kii raftaar doguniunhone apane kaamkaaj ke mantra ginaae, aage ke liye kuch sankalp liye or satta main bane rahete hue kai nae kirtimanon ko sthapit karne kii bechaini or adheeratha bhi jaahir kii
 In this way, he was seen giving signs to the people that if the development is to be taken forward, then his return in the upcoming election is the only option
 pradhanmantri ko ummid he ki aagaamee chunaavon main uttar-purvi rajyon main badhat milegi isliye bakhaanon main uttar-purv ke kayakalp ko khaas mahatv mila
 Also, he did not miss out on taking the names of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan on women's safety
 donon hi rajyon main agle kuch maheenon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Defensive Modimodi has always been aggressive in his speech
 lekin 2014 kii tulana main modi kaa yah bhaashan rakshaatmak zyaada nazar aayaa
 He kept avoiding controversies
 aise shabdon se dur rahe jo unhen yaa unki kamiyon ko jaahir karte
 From cow slaughter to the cleanliness of the Ganges, from Pakistan to NRC, from Dalit oppression to mob lynching and from jobs opportunities to farmer suicides, Modi refrained from conveying anything to the country
 haalanki alpsankhyakon ke zikr se bachate modi tripal talaak par patibaddhta doharaate nazar aae
 He discussed the support price of farmers and double the income
 sargical strike or rojgaar ke badhate avasaron kaa zikr kiya
 He also stressed about India's growing reputation on the international stage
 ise padhein
 
 
 After separating from the PDP, Modi remembered Vajpayee's 'vision Kashmir' as he remained silent on India's weakening situation from China and Pakistan to South Asia
 or to or, jammu-kashmir main jo pidipi bhaajapa ko baar-baar yah yaad dilaati rahi ki vartmaan sarkaar ko phir se atal bihari vaajapeyi ke kashmir vijan par dhyaan dena chahie, us vijan kii yaad bhi pradhanmantri ko tab ai jab party ne rajya main pidipi se gathbandhan tod diya
 The kind of speeches Modi gave earlier on inflation, how successful the government was on black money, and what he thinks now about his views on the falling credit of the rupee, it was not revealed anywhere in Modi's speech
 ise padhein
 
 
 39 times 'poor', know how many times in PM Modi's speech, how many times the dictionary would have been heard, if you listen to almost all the speeches of the Prime Minister, then a kind of repetition will be seen in it
 neem coted uria se lekar shauchalayon kaa nirmaan, bhai-bhatijawad se mukti or bhrashtachar par lagaam, kaamkaaj main paardarshita or sainikon kaa sammaan, starop india, standap india, mek in india, ez of duing bijness
 
 
 Modi has been repeating many such slogans and adjectives in his speeches
 is lihaaj se pradhanmantri kaa yah paanchvaan sambodhan ek surakshit punraritiyon kaa sambodhan bhar banakar rah gaya
 The Prime Minister's body language looked somewhat weaker than before
 wo shabdon ko doharaate hue apane jaadu ko kaayam rakh paane main kamazor padate nazar aae
 It felt as if the front page has become empty in his dictionary for the art of showing new dreams, the words have become empty
 modi 82 minute bole
 But this time neither fascination nor enthusiasm
 kyonki aakarshan or utsaah ke jo maapdand unhone khud sthapit kiye hai, unka aaj kaa bhaashan unheen maapdandon par pichhadta nazar aa rahaa tha
 It is to be seen that after an election friendly speech with today's simple, defensive and repetitive words, when Modi will be in the field of election, then with how much energy and how much enthusiasm he will try to create new magic

 asaram apane paap ke aaropon kii sazaa jodhpur jail main bhoga rahe he
 Asaram cried a lot about the disease, made all efforts to call a female doctor, but now Asaram's new disease has been revealed
 nai beemaari baba ko bachaayegi nahin balki sirf or sirf fansaaegi
 Advocates are making arguments from India to England to save Asaram, but the accusation on Asaram is disgusting
 asaram kii hoicourt ne na sirf jamaanat khaarij kar di he, balki jodhpur court ne asaram kii shishyaa shilpi ko 3 din kii police remand main bhej diya he
 Finally, the government lawyer presented a medical report in the court, according to which Asaram has been described as suffering from a disease called pedophilia
 wo jehani beemaari jiskaa shikaar hone ke baad insaan rishte banane ke maamle main bade to bade bacchon se bhi fark karnaa bhul jaataa he
 In other words, after falling prey to this mental condition, a person begins to enjoy physical relations with children
 vaise to manovigyaan yaa medical science kii duniya main is beemaari ko peedophilia kehete hai, lekin haqiqat yahi he ki is peedophilia ke marizon ko takreeban puri duniya main hikaarat kii nigahon se dekha jaataa he
 Because pedophilia patients often prey on their sexual violence or frustrations to innocent people who do not even understand the world and worldliness
 asaram ke bare main ye khulaasa kiya he khud rajasthan ke adishnal solicytor general anand purohit ne
 This has been said in the Rajasthan High Court, where Asaram applied for his bail
 lekin isse pehle ki adaalat asaram ko zamaanat dene yaa naa dene ke masale par koi faisalaa kar paati, anand purohit ne asaram ko peedophilia kaa shikaar bataa kar cese kaa rukh hi badal diya
 Purohit said that it has been clear in the police investigation so far that Asaram has been indulging in misbehavior with girls and especially children in the guise of his image during satsang and discourse, which proves pedophilia disease
 purohit ne bataaya ki kis tarah asaram ne puri saazish rach kar naa sirf is ladki ko apane galat iraadon kaa shikaar banaaya, balki apni chaukadi kii madad se ashram kii kai duusari ladakiyon ke saath bhi najayas harakatein kin
 By the way, it is said about pedophilia that there is no cure in the world till now

 There is only one water at the bottom, each part is different at the top

 The drought changed the atmosphere of the people of Bundelkhand
 yahaan kii jalwaayu hi badal gai
 Local partner told that Bundelkhand has actually been green
 par kya log laut rahe hai
 No, now they are used to migrating
 vahaan par jeena unhone apni niyatimaan liya he
 So despite being green this year, there has been no decrease in migration

 After walking some fifty kilometers we reached the village of Ghughasi

 He talked about drought, talked about farming, talked about the problems of the village, but most of all was interested in the well
 ek do log or aa gaye
 Told that this was the only source of sweet water in the village
 isi se sabhi log pine kaa pani lete aae hai saalon se
 But there should be no quarrels, so it is arranged that everyone has their own ghats
 bade log duusare ghat se pani lete hai, or chote logon ke apane ghat hai
 In response to why this is so, it comes again and again to avoid fight
 ladaai jhagada kis baat kaa ? is baat par koi bolne ko taiyaar nahin
 However, it is the people who have considered it their destiny
 gaanv main ek pipe line bhi khud rahi hai main sadak se is pipe line ke jariye pani kii supplai hogi, lekin sarpanch pati ne hamen bataaya ki uskaa pani to haive banane ke liye supplai kiya jayega, hamen mil paaegaa yaa nahin pataa nahin
 However, he said that if this well is deepened, then the problem of heat will get rid of

 After all, why is such a fine partition in a village still acceptable and no one does anything on it? Why does no Gangi of this village dare to rope her in the right side of the other house even in the dark of night, while neither Thakur's house nor Thakur's courage in front of the well
 desh main loktantr kii sthapana ko saalon—saal biit gaye or panchayat raaj main to mahilaon ko pachaas fisadi aarakshan jaise krantikari faisle bhi ho gaye

 'not only Gandhi, after Gandhi, Nehru gave a speech from the Red Fort seven years after independence, which has been inspired by the author Piyush Babale in the recent book Nehru Myth and Truth' if any village in India a village, whether it belongs to any caste, or if we call it Chamar or Harijan, if there is any hindrance in eating and drinking, living and living, that village has never been liberated, c It has happened

 ’ Uddhav Thackeray will take oath as Maharashtra CM, Bal Thackeray did not contest 13-year-old loan 
 haalanki sharad pavaar aise nahin nikle
 Sharad Pawar stood up against nephew Ajit Pawar 13 years ago to repay the favor done to Bal Thackeray and removed all the thorns in the political path of Uddhav Thackeray
 sharad pavaar ne shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ko maharashtra kaa mukhyamantri banaakar bal thakare ke karj ko adaa kar diya he
 Actually in 2006, the political situation was similar
 us vakt ensipi kii taraf se sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule pehali baar rajyasabha kaa chunaav ladi thim
 Then Balasaheb Thackeray had not fielded any candidate against Supriya Sule
 thakare kaa kahana tha ki ye garv kii baat he ki maharashtra kii beti dilli ja rahi he
 She has grown up in front of us, so we will not field candidates in front of her
 is tarah supriya sule rajyasabha ke liye chuni gai thim
 Bal Thackeray had thus discharged the healthy tradition of politics which is rarely seen today
 sharad pavaar ke paas 13 saal baad raajnneetikhalaaton ke chalate ek mauka aayaa to unhone bhi aisi hi nazeer pesh kii he
 Sharad Pawar has redeemed that favor by making Uddhav Thackeray the CM today
 maharashtra ke chunavi nattejey aane ke baad siyaasi halaat kuch aise bane ki bijepi se shivasena kaa talmail nahin baith sakaa
 As a result, Shiv Sena and BJP split
 congress-ensipi ke saath uddhav ne nayaa gathbandhan mahavikas aghadi banaaya
 Meanwhile, the rebellion of Ajit Pawar created a political crisis, after which Sharad Pawar took the front and in this way eased all the troubles of Uddhav Thackeray's political path
 ab khud sharad pavaar ne uddhav thakare ko puure paanch saal ke liye siem pad de diya wo bhi tab jab unke vidhayakon kii sankhya shivasena se mahaj do kam he
 In this way, in the political situation created after 13 years, Sharad Pawar has repaid the debt that Bal Thackeray had done in 2006 to send Supiya Sule to Rajya Sabha

 Sesame is one such healthy thing, which is very beneficial to take in pregnancy
 aamtaur par logon ko ye lagata he ki til keseven se garbhpaat k khatrabadh jaataa he par is baat kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Taking sesame in different forms is very beneficial
 ye poshak tatwon, calcium, amino acid, protein, vitamin or aayran se bharpoor hota he
 Constipation is a common problem in pregnancy and mole is a unique treatment

 This is the time when the pregnant woman needs calcium the most
 til ke seven se daant majboot banate hai or haddiyaan bhi kamjor nahin hone paati hai
 Although experts definitely say that the quantity of sesame should be balanced, it is wrong to ignore the benefits of sesame during this time

 Sesame is rich in many nutritional elements
 ye vahi saare tatv hote hai jinhengarbhavastha main lenaa aavashyakhai
 2
 garbhavastha main kabj ho janaa ek aam samasya he
 Consumption of sesame eliminates this problem occurring in pregnancy
 3
 Mole is helpful in boosting immunity
 iske alaava niyamit or santulit maatra main til ke seven se sardi-zukam hone kaa khatra bhi nahin rah jaataa

 Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, is now also being piled up with garbage
 darasal parvatarohan se mount everest par jane vaale dhani parvatarohiyon kii sankhya main ijapha ho rahaa he or mana ja rahaa he ki parvatarohi vahaan ke paryaavaran kaa koi lihaaj nahin rakh rahe hai
 Therefore, Mount Everest is turning into a garbage dump
 report ke anusaar, mount everest ke 8,848 meter lambey maarg main parvatarohi apane tent, bekaar ho chuke upkaran, khaali gas silendar or yahaan tak ki maanviya apshisht bhi chhod aate hai
 Pemba Dorje Sherpa, who has climbed Everest 18 times, says, "it is very bad and stings in the eyes
" '16 saal kii umr main kiya mount everest fatah, dekhen tasveerembta den ki pahaad par tanon kii maatra main kachra padaa he
 The number of people climbing Everest is increasing continuously
 is saal kam se kam 600 log ab tak chotii tak pahunch chuke hai
 The problem is getting worse by this
 iske saath hi vaishvik taapmaana main badhotaree se pigal rahe himandon ke saath-saath ye kachare bhi ubhar kar aa rahe hai
 Everest has been conquered 21 times in 23 years, the record will be made for the 22nd, and efforts have been made to reduce waste
 nepal ne niyam banaaya tha ki parvat par chadhane vaali prayek team ko kareeb dhai lakh rupee jamaa karne honge
 The amount will be returned to the climber who brings at least eight kilograms of waste in his year
 sagarmatha pradooshan niyantran samiti ke anusaar saal 2017 main nepal ke parvatarohi ne kareeb 25 ton kachra or 15 ton maanviya apshisht neeche lekar aae
 Even more waste was brought down this season, but it is a part of the garbage collected every year
 (navratri 2018) navaratri kaa paavan parv shuru ho chukaa he
 Along with the worship in Navratri, many people keep the festival for 9 days
 haalanki kai log 9 dinon ke bajaae pehle din or aakhri dinavratarakhte hai
 Although Navratri fast has religious significance, but fasting is also very beneficial for health
 1-vrath karne se sharir ke bheetar maujuud vishakt padaarth saaf ho jate hai
 Along with this, digestion also gets better than before
 2
 The fat burning process is accelerated during fasting
 jisase charbi teji se galanaa shuru ho jaati he
 3
 fat cells laptin naam kaa hormone straavit karti hai
 Getting less calories during fasting affects the activation of leptin and reduces weight
 4
 It is necessary to take some essential nutrients during the fast, or fasting may be painful for you
 vrath ke baad aap jab bhi kuch khaaen, koshish karen ki wo paushtik ho na ki fat se bharaa hua
 Otherwise the weight will increase rather than decrease
 5
 Fasting helps in the formation of new immune cells
 uniwarsity of south california ke visheshgyon kii maane to cancer ke marijon ke liye vrath rakhana bahut phydemand hota he
 Especially for patients who are taking chemotherapy
 6
 It is not necessary that you fast only when there is a religious occasion
 sharir kii andruni gandagi ko saaf karne or pachan kriya ko behatar banane ke liye aap kabhi bhi suvidhanusaar vrath kar sakate hai
 7
 kai adhyayanon main ye paaya gaya he ki kuch samay ke liye vrath rakhane se metabolic rate main 3 se 14 fisadi tak badhottaree hoti he
 If this is really the case then it will take less time to digestion and burn calories
 8
 Fasting also keeps the mind healthy
 vrath karne se depressant or mastishk se judi kai samasyaon main phayda hota he
 9
 vrath karne ke dauraan aapako is baat kaa bhi andaja ho jaataa he ki aapkaa khanpan kitna galat he
 10
 aaj ke samay main tanaav ek bahut badi medical problem he
 Fasting reduces stress
 vaise to deshbhar main aazaadee kii 69veen saalagirah bade hi josh or ullas ke saath manaai ja rahi he
 But in Sirohi, Rajasthan, people also painted their deity in the color of tricolor
 aasthaa yah kaa rang kuch anuthe andaaj main tab dekhne ko mila, jab sirohi ke hanuman mandir main bhakton ne bajrangbali kii pratimaa par 'tirangaa' shringaar kar dharmik aasthaa ko deshprem se jod diya
 Local people say that while there is a celebratory atmosphere on this day throughout the country, temples should also participate in this celebration
 isi soch ko lekar unhone hanumanji ke pratimaa ko tirange se ranga he
 This idol of Hanumanji is being discussed everywhere
 jo bhi is pratimaa ke bare main sun rahaa he, vah iske darshan karne jarur pahunch rahaa he

 radhika yani sonakshi manoj vaajapeyi se kisi tarah bhaagane kii koshish main he or agra kaa ladkaa pintu yani arjuna kapur use bachaane ke liye bhaagta rahata he
 The film 'tevar' is a remake of the 2003 Telugu hit film "okkadu"
 shuruyaat se ye kaha gaya kii film 'tevar' ek lav-story he, meri nazar main bhi ye he ek prem kahani to he magar ek sanakee premi kaa ek tarafa pyaar he
 Yes, if a hero is saving a heroine in the film, then in the end he has to be in love, this is the story of 'tevar'
 film 'tevar' bollywood kii masala filmon kii tarah he
 There is action in this film, there are glimpses of Mathura and Agra, there are some tickling scenes and dialogues that will make you laugh and sometimes thodaa imoshan bhi dekhne ko milenge
 Manoj Bajpayee has given his life in the role of Bahubali and Sirfire Aashiq
 arjuna kapur or sonakshi sinha ne bhi apane kirdaaron ke saath insaaf kiya he
 Amit Sharma's direction is also fine
 film kii kami kii baat kii jaae to wo yah ki film 'tevar' zarurat se zyaada lambii he
 If this film were a little shorter then its 'tevar' would have been a bit more fun
 film kaa sangeet bhi saadhaaran he
 Overall, one can say that an attempt has been made to make this film a spice entertainer, but the film does not appear to leave much of an impact
 agar aap masala filmein dekhnaa pasand karte hai to ek baar is film ko dekh sakate hai
 So my rating for this film is 3 stars

 In fact, Jyotiraditya Scindia had on February 13, after a long conversation with Ramlal Rahi and former Congress Gurjar leader Avtar Singh Bhadana, decided to return home to the Congress
 aise main rajasthan ke up mukhyamantri sachin payalat ke saath avatar singh bhadaana jaise gurjar netaaon kii jodi pashchimi upi samet haryana or rajasthan ke ilaakon main congress kii rajnatik jameen ko khaad-pani de sakati he
 With this, the Congress, engaged in the search for the winning candidates before the Lok Sabha elections, is preparing to return home to its old leaders who have gone to other parties and regain their lost glory in UP

 Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya have tried to catch the 'sickness' of the sluggish party in UP by holding public meetings with local Congress leaders
 booth par focusaupi aane se pehle priyanka ko is baat kaa bakhubi ehsaas ho chukaa tha ki agle loksabhaa chunaav kii jang booth str par hi ladi jaaegi
 Priyanka's biggest challenge is to prepare the Congress fighters on this lower rung
 lakhanu main 12 farvari kii dopaher se priyanka gandhi ne congress daftar main loksabhavar netaaon kii toliyon se milanaa shuru kar diya tha
 In the state president's room, Priyanka and Jyotiraditya were meeting the leaders in an interview
 priyanka se sabase pehle unnav loksabhaa kshetra ke netaa purv saansad anu tandon ke saath mili
 Priyanka started asking: "how many booths are there in your area?", "what is the number of your home booth?", "what is the position of Congress organization at the booth?", "how many voters are there in each booth ? " Through such questions, Priyanka tried to convince the leaders of every Lok Sabha constituency that the Lok Sabha election cannot be won without a booth
 yahi kamajori congress ko 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi dikhaai di thi jab sapa ke saath gathbandhan kar 114 siton par lard rahi party 30 pratishat boothon par poling agent bhi nahin dhund pai thi
 Now Priyanka has resorted to the Amethi and Rae Bareli models to overcome the extremely difficult challenge of setting up the organization at more than 1
5 lakh booths just before the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke vidhaan parishad sadsy deepak singh bataate hai, ''raibareli or amethi main booth kaaryakartaaon ko whatsap gurp se jod kar ek plateform taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The policies of the party are brought to the booth level through a chaupal
 " priyanka or jyotiraditya ne jila adhyakshon ko booth kaaryakartaaon kaa whatsap group banaakar niyamit chaoupal ke jariye party ke nirdeshon ko jamini str par amal main laane ke nirdesh die hai
 While meeting the leaders of Bharosamohanlalganj Lok Sabha constituency on the old organization itself, Priyanka introduced herself as a state general secretary to Priyanka

 a post shared by Neetu n Chandra (@neetunchandra) on May 20, 2018 at 10:15 pm PDT aaj subah hi maine ghar phone milaayaa, mai idhar se hello-hello karata rahaa par udhar se koi aawaaj hi nahin aayi
 Then the situation remained the same even when i got a call from home
 apane tisare prayaas main ghar se baat kar paaya
 Talked to friends then it was found out that this happens to them too
 offis main aayaa to ittaphacan isi par baat ho rahi thi or tivi par doorsanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ko bhi isi mudde par baat karte suna tab pataa chalaa ki maamla kol-drops kaa he
 After all, why are call drops happening? Telephone companies say that they do not have full spectrum
 mantri ji kah rahe ki paryaapt spectrum hai
 Well, even if we do not talk about spectrum, the head of Typa (TAIPA), the apex organization of companies that set up mobile towers in the country, Umang Das says that there is a requirement of 1
25 lakh towers in the country but only 4 lakh towers are available
 agar prati tower 5 lakh kaa hisaab bhi lagaaein to 10 hazaar karod rupee tak ke tatkaal nivesh kii aavashyaktaa he jo telecom kapaniyon ke munaafe ke mukaable kuch bhi nahin hai
 How much loss are you getting from the call drop? The quarterly report read by TRAI then some mathematics started to understand how the telecom companies are cheating us all
 bharat main 97 karod se zyada telephone upabhokta he jinamein 94 karod mobile yuzars he
 We-you are part of this calculation
 report kahati ki ham ek din main ausatan 10 minute se zyada baat karte hai
 And if you mind, you have only 1 call drop in the whole day and you have to pay 10 paise (which is minimum) per call
 to bhi salanaa takreeban teen hazaar karod se bhi zyada kaa munafa telephone kapaniyaan sirf kol drops se uthaa rahi hai
 We all have to repay it from our pocket
 bangladesh or pakistan se bhifisddi?kol drops kii shikaayat sirf bharat main hi nahin balki hamaare padosi deshon main bhi hai
 But there is neither people sitting silent like us nor their telecom regulatory body, and perhaps this is why the telecom companies of Bangladesh and Pakistan give a free call on every call drop
 aise main sawaal ye he ki bharat main kol drops ke liye aise praavdhaan kyon nahin hai ? BSP chief Mayawati said in a big statement that she will not tie up with Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan at any cost
 unka ye faisla achaanak yun hi nahin aayaa
 In fact, a statement from Congress leader Digvijay Singh came today, which badly upset Mayawati
 darasal congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne ek samachar channel se intervyuu main ishaaron main kaha tha ki mayawati par sibiai or idi kaa dabaav he, jisaki vajah se vah congress ke saath nahin aa rahi hai
 He said that he respects Mayawati and also understands her helplessness
 saath hi unhone kaha tha ki madhya pradesh main gathbandhan kii jimmedaari kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya kii he
 Digvijay Singh said this to Mayawati
 unhone aaj shaam press conference kar na sirf gathbandhan se khud ko alag kiya, balki digvijay singh ko bijepi kaa agent tak kah daalaa
 Mayawati launched a direct attack on Digvijay Singh and said that he is an agent of BJP
 digvijay kehete hai mayawati par centre se dabaav he jiske chalate ve gathbandhan nahin kar rahi hai
 His statement is completely baseless
 digvijay ke alaava unhone kuch anya netaaon kii ore bhi ishaara kiya
 Mayawati said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi were showing complete honesty in alliance with BSP, but some Congress leaders do not want to let this happen
 unhone kaha ki digvijay jaise netaa nahin chaahate ki congress-bispi main gathbandhan ho
 Mayawati attacked Congress after Digvijay
 unhone kaha ki congress samajhati he ki wo bijepi ko akele hi haraa degi, lekin jamini hakeekat kuch or he
 People will punish the Congress for their mistakes and corruption
 mayawati ke is faisle kaa asar na sirf asann vidhansabha chunaavon main dikhegaa, balki 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav ke samikarnon par bhi rahegaa
 Many parties, including the Congress, are taking full advantage of building a coalition to fight Modi in 2019, but Mayawati's decision may be overshadowed by this
 vahiin congress ne damege control karte hue mayawati ke is faisle par kaha ki unhone ye bayaan gusse main diya he
 It should not be overpowered
 congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki congress netaa ke bare main kii gai pratikul tippanee ham sahi nahin samajhate, par gusse main bhaawanaaon main kii gai tippanee ko itnaa tool nahin dena chahie

 The question is raised because it cheats the public
 bhaajapa-shivasena ke chunavi gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane kaa janadesh mila lekin shivasena isse baahar nikal gai or usne nae sahyogi dalon ke saath sarkaar bana lee
 The process of entering and leaving the coalition is not actually codified, that is, laws have not been made on this subject

 ve
 a bench of Ramanna, Justices Ashok Bhushan and Sanjeev Khanna rejected
 adaalat kaa kahana tha ki ham is maamle main nahin padana chaahate
 Justice Ramanna said that political morality is completely different from constitutional ethics
 loktantr main ham gathbandhan banane ke adhikaar se raajnneetik partiyon ko vanchit nahin kar sakate hai
 There are two types of strategies of political parties, one before the election and the other after the results
 chunaav ke pehle puraa jor matadaata ko apni ore khinchne par hota he or nateezon se hasil raajnneetik shakti kaa istemaal jo nivesh chunaav main kiya he uski vasuuli ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 For this, the alliance is not legally wrong

 In September 2015, a similar petition came before the Supreme Court, demanding that the post-election political alliance be deemed unconstitutional by the court
 ye yachika bhi khaarij ho gai thi or court ne maamle main dakhal dene se inkaar kar diya tha

 yaa raajnneetik dal ye bhi kah sakate hai ki dobaaraa chunaav kaa kharch bachaane ke liye hamane gathbandhan kiya he
 Justice Amitabh Rai of the same bench had asked the petitioner that which is the law which compels political parties to fulfill the promises made during elections
 gathbandhanon kii raajnneeti ko samhitabaddh karnaa bahut mushkil kaam he
 The freedom of expression of mps is also hampered by this

 Vivek, 37, told in an interview that acting in films is my passion, but the kind of complacency and meaningfulness that comes into my life by wiping the tears of others and bringing smiles on faces is very special
 
 That happiness gives me more satisfaction than any award and reward i have received till date

 You must have heard and seen the exchange offer of TV fridge
 lekin ab apradhi bhi axange ofer ke tahat giraftaar kiye ja rahe hai
 These exchange offers are falling on the criminals like gazes these days
 kabhi sef jone main aparaadh kar aaraam karne vaale apradhi ab bhaage bhaage phir rahe hai, lekin aakhir bhaagen bhi to kahaan
 Nepal is no longer a safe zone
 ye baat kisi or se nahin balki indian mujahiddeen ke aatanki yasin bhatkal se zyada koi nahin jaan saktaa he
 Yasin Bhatkal, the operational head of the Indian Mujahideen, had been living comfortably in Pokhara, Nepal for the past two years
 uskaa saathi haddi bhi uske saath tha
 Yasin Bhatkal, who slew the security and intelligence agencies in India with many blasts, was hiding in Nepal comfortably for the last two years, but suddenly one day the Bihar police with the help of Nepal police caught him
 yah aparaadhiyon ke axange kaa sabase bada ofer tha
 It was not an easy task to arrest Bhatkal, a better coordinator in the indo-nepal Police
 border se kai sau kilometre dur wo apni suraksha ghere main rah rahaa tha
 At first he was seen by a whistleblower reading Nawaz in a mosque, under whose guise a major operation was carried out
 ye sambhav ho paaya nepal police kii madad se
 There is no extradition treaty between the two countries, which criminals have been taking advantage of till now
 lekin ab donon deshon ke police adhikariyon ke bich behatar talmail kii vajah se ek se ek apradhi pakade ja rahe hai jisamen yasin bhatkal jaisaa aatankwaadi bhi shaamil he
 Motihari SP Vinay Kumar, who played a key role in the arrest of Yasin Bhatkal, also believes that the Nepal Police's full cooperation was there
 bharat ne nepal ko die 5 apradhimana ja rahaa he ki yasin bhatkal kii giraftaar ke evaj main bihar police ne kam se kam paanch nami khoonkhaar aparaadhiyon ko nepal ke hawaale kiya he jise kai varshon se nepal police khoj rahi thi
 However, it is a different matter that the place of such arrests is technically called a border due to the absence of an extradition treaty
 donon deshon ke adhikariyon ke bich behatar talmail kii vajah se na sirf apradhi balki taskari karne vaale yaa phir hawala kaa kaam karne vaale bhi pakade ja rahe hai
 The latest victim of this better synergy is Fauji Singh who, living in Nepal for years, has been a terror for many districts of Bihar
 shuukravaar ko ise giraftaar kiya gaya
 This too is the result of the criminal exchange offer
 sunil jaisawal ko bhi nepal police ko saumpakuch din pehle nepal ke durdaant apradhi sunil jaisawal ko police ne giraftaar kiya or use nepal police ko saunp diya
 Sunil Jaiswal was accused of murder in Nepal
 usne chaar maovadi netaaon kii hatya kii thi
 So Babu Dubey, the terror of many districts of other Bihar, was arrested in Kathmandu by Nepal Police, but technically he could not be handed over to Bihar Police due to no extradition treaty
 aise main nepal police ne use border par choda jahaan motihaari police ne use phir giraftaar kar liya
 Bablu Dubey has more than a hundred extortion cases and dozens of murder charges registered in many districts of Bihar
 donon desh ke bich pratyrpan sandhi nahin hone kii vajah se takneekee dikkatein to hai lekin behatar talmail kii vajah se ye sambhav ho paa rahaa he
 In the last 9 to 10 months, hundreds of criminals have been arrested by the police of both countries
 ye apradhi na sirf khoonkhaar the balki wo apradhi bhi pakade ja rahe hai jo chotemote aparaadh kar nepal bhaag jate the
 Motihari SP says that till now only 80 percent of the escaped criminals of East Champaran have been arrested from Nepal
 nepal ab aparaadhiyon ke liye sef jone nahin rahaa iskaa pataa bhi chal rahaa he
 The criminals who used to live in Nepal after fleeing unknowingly after committing the crime in India, have been fleeing today and their whereabouts are constantly changing
 bharat or nepal donon kii police unke peeche lagi hui he, kab pakade jaaenge koi thikaana nahin he
 This was not the case earlier
 bhartiya police kaa nepal police ke saath koi talmail nahin tha or pratyrpan sandhi na hone kii vajah se apradhi aparaadh karne ke baad bekhauf hokar ek duusare ke desh main sharan lete the, jiskaa sidhaa asar vahaan kii janata par padataa tha
 Living in awe in the border areas was a compulsion of common people, but the general public is happy with the new situation
 baharhaal sthaneey str par ho rahe is behatar talmail se na sirf apradhi pakade ja rahe hai balki donon deshon kii janata ke bich ek nayaa vishwaas paidaa ho rahaa he jo ki pichley kuch varshon main tuutane kii kagaar par tha

 naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh ne payalton or anya karmchaariyon ko yaad dilaate hue kaha ki unka bhavishya air india se judaa he
 Singh said that no one will give more public money to the airline now and if the company does not become competitive as soon as possible, it will not be able to last long
 naagarik uddyan mantri ne kaha, ‘ham unka intjaar nahin kar rahe hai
 We are making our plans
 yadi aap ve-737 yaa airbas 320 ke prashikshit payalton ko lete hai, to teen se chah maah main ve in vimaanon ko uda sakate hai

 After an hour-long meeting, sources said, 'we want an early solution to the IPG pilots' strike
 ham chaahate hai ki mantri iskaa samaadhaan karen, lekin vah apane rukh par kaayam hai or kah rahe hai ki payalton ko apni hadtaal khatm kerani hogi or 101 barkhaast payalton kii bahaali har maamle ke aadhaar par hi hogi
 'this meeting has taken place against the backdrop of the letter of executive pilots in which they said that they have been under lot of work pressure
 mantri ne kaha ki punaroddhar kii apni yojana ke tahat yadi ham dharmadhikari report ko lagu karte hai, to hamen kaaphi dhary baratna hoga, saath hi majbootee bhi dikhaani hogi

 There was no issue
