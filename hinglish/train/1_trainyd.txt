 jab unke or kallis ke bich kii saajhedaari khatarnaak banati ja rahi thi tab srisanth ne khubasurat outswinger par divilliars ke rup main bharatiyon ko mahatvapurn safalataa dilaayi
 De Villiers wanted to drive on this full length ball, but due to a swing in the last moments, he lost the ball and caught Dhoni
 unhone 72 gend kaa saamana kiya tathaa teen chauke lagaaye
 He shared a 58-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Kallis
 kallis ne iske turant baad harbhajan kii gend par ek ran lekar apana 55waan ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Kallis was seen in danger only once in this innings, while he narrowly avoided Gautam Gambhir's direct throw

 So why are they afraid of the budget? ’ With the announcement of the schedule of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur, the Central Election Commission is now reviewing whether the central government can present the annual budget on 1 February

 yah sanvaidhanik aavashyaktaa he
 'the government has long changed the tradition of presenting the budget at the end of February with an intention to start spending on welfare and other schemes from the first day of the financial year
 sarkaar ne 31 janvari ko sansad kaa bajet satr bulaane kaa faisla kiya or agle din ek farvari ko aam bajet pesh kiya jayega
 The elections in Punjab and Goa will be held on February 4, while in three other states including Uttar Pradesh, elections will be held thereafter
 kuch raajnneetik dal raashtrapati or chunaav ayog se milakar ek farvari ko bajet pesh kiye jane ke nirnay par virodh jataayaa
 Jaitley said that the main reason behind presenting the budget first is to start spending first because in the situation till now, spending could start after the monsoon
 unhone kaha, ‘vaastavik vyay monsoon ke baad aadha varsh biit jane ke bajaae april se hona chahie

 He said, 'the actual expenditure should be from April rather than half a year after the monsoon

 He was informed by an official that the documents filed by Smriti Irani related to his educational qualification were not known
 chunaav ayog se mul dastavej record laane ko kaha gaya tha kyonki shikayatakarta kaa aarope tha ki 2004 main chandani chowk loksabhaa kshetra se chunaav ladane ke liye ayog ke samaksh daakhil smriti ke halafname main unhen snaatak bataaya gaya tha
 The official said in the court that the original documents filed by Smriti regarding the educational qualification of Smriti were not known but the information in this regard is available on the website of the Commission

 india today ko artiai ke jariye ganga punaruddhar mantralay se mili jawaab ke mutabik ghaaton ke kinare ganga ke pani main vishtha coliform bacteria kaa dooshan 58 fisadi bad gaya he
 The presence of more than 2,500 coliform microorganisms in 1000 ml of water makes it unsafe for bathing
 varanasi ke malviya brij se liye gaye ganga ke pani ke namoonay main bacteria dooshan aadhikarik maanakon se 20 guna adhik paaya gaya
 In a reply to the RTI, the government has acknowledged that in 2017, 49,000 per 100 milliliter colostrum bacteria were found in a sample of water taken from the bridge, compared to 31,000 per 100 ml in 2014
 visheshgyon ke mutabik vishtha coliform bacteria sivej dooshan ko darshata he
 It is also an indicator of the possible presence of other pathogenic microorganisms in the water
 mantralay ne artiai ke jawaab main kendriya pradooshan niyantran board ke data kaa hawala dete hue bataaya- ‘varanasi main ganga nadi main mote taur par paanch naale milte hai jinase har din das lakh litre se zyada bahaav aata he
 Seeing dead water animals on the ghats of this ancient city considered to be salvation is nothing short of a tragedy
 inaki maut kaa kaaran ye he ki ganga ke pani main oxigen kam hoti ja rahi he
 The clearest evidence of this is in response to the Ministry which considered that the amount of oxygen dissolved in water at eighty ghats was 8 in 2014
 6 milligram prati litre thi jo 2017 main ghatakar 7
 5 mg per liter
 ye 5 milligram prati litre maanak ke bilkul kareeb aa gai he
 There has been no change in bacteria contamination at Assi Ghat in the last three years
 2014 kii tarah hi ye 2017 main bhi 2,200 prati 100 millilitre ke str par bana hua he
 The 2,500-km-long holy river was engulfed by pollution in several places in the Namami Gange States check from India Today

 The official reply said that official institutions have succeeded in closing only 10 new drains, otherwise their dirty water would have come in the Ganges itself
 kanpur jise kabhi purab kaa manchester kaha jaataa tha, vahaan ganga nadi ke tat par kaali-slate gaad india today ke camere main kaid hui
 The dirty water of drains can also be seen mixing in the Ganges in the Paramat located in the neighborhood of Kanpur
 ek sthaneey naagarik amit dikshit kaa kahana he, ‘ganga ko sirf sarkaar kii ore se kii gai pahalon ke aadhaar par saaf nahin kiya ja saktaa
 People will also have to be aware and take active part in the cleanliness drive of Ganga
 ’ kanpur main ganga nadi ke pradooshan ke liye mote taur par chamade ke kaarkaanon se nikalne vaala kachra jimmedaar he
 In the last few years, the authorities have closed several leather factories in Jajmau area

 But many leather factories are still operational in the area

 500 crore has been spent on the Ganges and sewage system in Kanpur
 ’ bihar ke patna main ganga nadi main gater kaa pani bajabajate dekha ja saktaa he
 There are also piles of garbage on the river ghats
 pashchim bengal main ganga nadi ke aakhri padaav main dooshan kaa str kahin zyada he
 In this state, 222 big drains fall in the Ganges river
 jadavapur uniwarsity main professor or samudri adhyayan nideshak dow sugata haajra kaa kahana he, ‘bengal ke uttari hisse main ganga kaa sabase pradooshit hissaa he
 The coliform bacteria here are over 160,000 per liter
 ’ dow haajra ne aagaah kiya ki bina treet kiya gaya sivej ab bhi badi maatra main har din ganga se mil rahaa he
 Therefore, the water of the river is neither drinkable nor bathing here because it has heavy metal contamination

 For this, a budgetary allocation of Rs 20,000 crore was kept till December 2000

 Government records show that Rs 8,454 crore has been released by the National Mission for Clean Ganga to remove pollutants from the river

 The ministry says that new sewage treatment plants (stps) are being built in Varanasi on the basis of public-private partnership
 ye bharat main apni tarah kaa pehla kadam he
 Two stps with a capacity to treat 362 MLD sewage will be installed by October
 ek or plant agle saal march se pehle taiyaar ho jayega
 Senior officials of the ministry believe that the pollution of the Ganga in the Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency will be dealt with to a great extent by starting the work of the new STP

 The city has gone further

 In view of this, many schools have started counseling their students

 Not only this, five other people working in his shop also became unemployed
 isse unke parivaar ke saamne bhi bharan-poshan kii samasya khadi ho gai
 Now the victim has pleaded with the SHO to take responsibility for the upbringing of himself and his family members

 Something similar is happening with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) these days
 agast 2018 main dilli main sattarudh aap ko do tagade jatke lage jab uske do diggajon, ashutosh or ashish khetaan ne use alavida kah diya
 AAP leaders have been leaving the party earlier too, but this time both leaders have left the party due to personal reasons
 donon peshey se patrkaar rah chuke hai par khetaan ab vakil ke taur par apni nai pari shuru karne vaale hai
 He had made the party aware of his decision several times earlier and due to this, in April, he resigned from the Delhi Dialogue and Development Commission and expressed his intention to raise public interest issues in the court
 unhone bataaya, ‘‘philhal dilli hycourt main practice karuunga
 The LLM will be thought of later
 ’’ashutosh ne nijee kaarnon se party chhodane kii baat jarur kahi he lekin party ke bheetar ek varg unke aap se jane ko rajyasabha seat se jodakar dekh rahaa he
 Ashutosh, 53, a member of the party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC), was unmoved since he sent the Gupta brothers to the Rajya Sabha in January
 unke istife ke baad party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit karke kaha, ‘‘ham kabhi bhi aapkaa istipha kaise manjuur kar sakate hai
 No, not in this birth
 sar, ham sab aapako bahut pyaar karte hai
 "zahir, the party is not accepting resignation at its level
" aap ke mukhya pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne india today se kaha, ‘‘in donon ne istipha diya he par party ne manjuuri nahin di he
 The party will try to have both come back
 ’’ lekin ashutosh ne isse jude likhit sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘‘main party main waapas nahin aauungaa
 "earlier on August 29, Ashutosh tweeted," Nobody ever asked my caste or surname during my career in journalism, but my surname was emphasized a lot while introducing AAP workers in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ’’party sutron kaa kahana he ki aisa jatigat vot batorne ke liye kiya gaya kyonki unke chunaav kshetra main unki jati ke voter kaaphi hai
 Ashutosh's statement was considered an attack on AAP but he considered himself free from party discipline with the tweet being misunderstood
 party kii website par pravanntaaon kii suchi main khetaan or ashutosh ke saath kumaar vishwaas kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 But the distance from the party of faith has increased so much that it seems impossible to end it
 isse pehle prashanth bhushan, yogendra yadav jaise anna andolan ke vakt ke saathi arvind kejariwal ke netritv ko chunauti dene ke chakkar main party se juda ho gaye the
 Abhay Kumar Dubey, a political analyst who monitors aap's politics, says, "the leaders who first went to the fight, the fight for control and control of the party was the reason behind it
" lekin in donon kaa maamla nijee vajahon se judaa hua he
 According to Dubey, it is speculated that Ashutosh left the party due to a Rajya Sabha ticket
 dilli ke baad aap ke duusare sabase bade garh punjab main bhi party ko gutbaji kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The main opposition party AAP has an active faction of rebel mlas in the Punjab Assembly under Sukhpal Singh Khaira

 The conversation is going on

 "it has always been challenging for the AAP to keep the mps-mlas of Punjab under control

 Before January 16, Arvind Kejriwal used to make fun of Delhi BJP leaders by naming them
 kiske boote bijepi unka saamana kar paaegi? magarkiran bedi ko jis tarah bijepine party jwine karne ke chauthe hi din mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya, aam aadmi party ko apana pintara hi badalanaa pad gaya
 Kejriwal's invitation to Kiran Bedi for public debate and then Bedi's refusal to take up the debate on the pretext of debate has been weaponized by the Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party ke kumaar vishwaas ek twit karte hai
 In this, he has attached a screen shot of a tweet by Kiran Bedi
 saal 2012 ke is twit main kiran kah rahi hai ki vah obama or romany ke bich live bahes dekh rahi hai
 And don't miss it, too
 kumaar vishwaas kaa is par coment he, “didi aap ko aisi hi ek bhartiya bahes tak sweekaar nahin? aap to kahati thim – ‘ai daire’?” kejariwal ne bhi ise ritvit kiya he
 Kejriwal has also retweeted a post by AAP supporter writer Chanchal Sharma
 jisamen kal prasaarit hue tivi sho kaa video he, jise kiran bedi naaraaz hokar bich main hi chhod kar chali gayi
 Kumar Vishwas has also posted a screen shot of Kiran Bedi's tweet dated June 22, 2012, in which Kiran mentioned candidate PA Sangma challenging the debate on Pranab Mukherjee during the presidential election
 ek kavi vaale andaaj main kumaar vishwaas is par ek imotional coment karte hai, “tumhen yaad ho naa yaad ho?”kiran ko kathghare main khadaa karne kii chunautiaam aadmi party netaa kejariwal ke saamne ab usee shaks ko kathghare main khadaa karne kii chunauti he jise kabhi khud unhone dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kii peshkash kii thi (jaisi ki khabaren ai thim)
 Kejriwal himself is a byproduct of the Anna movement and now he has to prove the same person wrong who once stood strong in his agenda and campaign
 aakhir kejariwal kiran bedi kii kaabiliyat par sawaal to uthaa nahin sakate
 Kejriwal cannot raise his finger on Kiran Bedi's honesty
 kejariwal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kiran kii niyat par bhi sawaal nahin khadey kar sakate
 Is Kiran Bedi Modi's insurance policy? In an interview, Aam Aadmi Party's master strategist Yogendra Yadav described Kiran Bedi as Modi's "insurance policy"

 But the question is then what is the rationale of house tax
 kyonki isi kaam ke liye house tex liya jaataa he
 Opposition annoyed! Mukesh Goyal, leader of Congress councilor in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, says BJP does not see its own corruption and that is why every year there is an attempt to impose new taxes
 lekin ham is saal bhi iskaa virodh karenge
 At the same time, the BJP, held in the MCD, says that it is a proposal

 '' unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke maargdarshan main bijepi ko yah jeet mili he
 During this, he also attacked the SP and BSP alliance fiercely
 bispi kaa vidhayak agava karne kaa aaropawahin bispi netaa satish mishra ne haar par bayaan dete hue kaha ki bijepi ne uske do vidhayak agava kiye or takat ke bal par haari hui seat ko jeeta
 Till date, he has not seen so much rigging in the counting of votes
 isse pehle bijepi ke aath vidhayak or sapa pratyaashee jaya bachchan aasaani se jeet gai
 Jaya received a total of 38 votes
 ballat paper or cross voting par mili shikaayat par counting ke dauraan chunaav ayog kaa faisla aayaa or bijepi or bispi vidhayakon ke 1-1 vot radd kar die gaye
 At the same time, an MLA of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party accused the BJP agent of tearing down votes

 If the votes are torn then there will be an FIR on the tearing
 aapako bataa den ki upi main rajyasabha chunaav ke liye pehla vot sapa ke shivpal yadav ne daalaa
 Objection on ballot paper arose in UP Rajya Sabha election when countingcounting started

 It was alleged that Nitin Aggarwal and Anil Singh did not show their votes to the Authorize agent
 isaki shikaayat bispi ne chunaav ayog se kii he or isi vajah se counting roki gai he

 darasal raja bhaiya ne apana vot samaajawaadee party ke liye rakhaa he or 37wein voter ke taur apana vot daalane vaale hai
 But now a candidate needs only 36 votes to win
 aise main raja bhaiya kaa 37 main vot kaa kuch pratishat basapa ko ja saktaa he
 That is why it was believed that Raja Bhaiya would not vote
 vahiin sutron ke mutabik bijepi ne rajyasabha ke liye badi ranneeti banaai thi
 According to the mathematics of votes, BJP will not get the votes of two mlas
 aise main ab rajyasabha sadsy ke chayan ke liye 36 voton kii jarurat hogi
 That means there will be a total of 398 votes in UP
 haalanki 400 vot pade
 The ban was on the voting of two mlas even before the commencement of the election, the High Court had stayed the vote of Mukhtar Ansari in the second case also
 isse pehle unhen shuukravaar ko ho rahe rajyasabha chunaav main vot daalane ke liye nichali court se anumati mili thi

 He also did not give his party's support during the election, SP MLA Nitin Aggarwal said that Samajwadi Party gives preference to the entertainers of the society, whereas the bjp's society

 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar believes that selectors should not only select players based on the scorebook, but instead should focus on the player's ability to cope with pressure
 tendulkar ne kaha, ‘chayan sirf scorebuk dekhne se judaa nahin hona chahie
 The selector can select players who have scored too many runs but this will not work
 maine aise khilaadi dekhe hai, jo gharelu str par bejod the, lekin antarrashtriya str par utana acha pradarshan nahin kar paae
 "he said," Players have to be assessed at the time of selection
 agar vah kuch maichon main vifal bhi ho jaae to bhi yah dekhne kii jarurat he ki kya usamen dabaav jhelane kii kshamta he or kya vah antarrashtriya cricket main pradarshan kar saktaa he
 Tendulkar said other changes in cricket, including the T20 format facing criticism, have made the game more exciting and have been successful in achieving greater results in Test matches
 unhone kaha, ‘cricket ekmaatr khel he jisamen teen formet hai
 It is becoming more exciting, not only for the players but also for the spectators
 ’tendulkar ke mutabik, ‘isamen kalaatmakataa he or ab or nattejey hasil kiye ja rahe hai
 The batsmen are ready to take the risk
 ’ purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ne kaha ki tii-20 kaa vanade or test cricket par bhi asar padaa he, kyonki khilaadi aakraamak ho gaye hai or iske alaava ab adhik nattejey mil rahe hai
 Ganguly said, 'it has brought newness to the game
 jab test cricket kii baat hoti he to aapako saamanjasy baithaana hota he or takanic ke lihaaj se koi do khilaadi ek jaise nahin hote
 It is important that players must stay on their basics
 ’purv test captain rahul dravid ne kaha ki tii-20 ne cricket ko adhik lacheela bana diya he
 He said, 'you have to learn to play some shots
 aap sirf har gend ko block nahin kar sakate jaisaa main test cricket main kiya karata tha
 Dravid said, "good players learn to adjust
" agar ham kris gail, maaikel hasi yaa abi divilliars ko pichley ipel main dekhen to dabadabaa banane vaale se sabhi kaaphi achche test khilaadi hai
 So we have to keep our basics right
 ’tendulkar ne kaha ki test cricket main tii-20 ke mukaable basics par dhyaan dena adhik mahatvapurn he
 He said, 'this is the only format (T20) in which you can become a hero even in three or four balls

 Captain Virat Kohli looked happy but not satisfied with the win over England

 The team lost three crucial wickets to a score of just 25
 agar yuvaraj singh (150) or mahendra singh dhoni (134) ne tufaani saajhedaari nahin kheli hoti to team kii haalat kuch or hi hoti
 The captain has raised questions about the opening pair for not getting a good start
 kohli ne match ke baad kaha, 'yadi sheersh kram ne bhi acha pradarshan kiya hota to ham isse behatar pradarshan kar sakate the
 i am surprised at what our score would have been if we had got a good start
 ' gendbaaji par bhi unhone kaha, 'ham jaanate the ki hamen wicket lene honge lekin ham din ke sabase mushkil samay main gendbaaji kar rahe the
 Comments udhar, england ke captain eon morgan ne kaha, "ham phir se apana sarvshereshth pradarshan nahin kar paae
 It is disappointing not to get so close and win
 dhoni or yuvaraj ke liye gendbaaji karnaa mushkil tha

 There was faith but we did not have the skills to deserve that

 unhone kaha ki yah unki sarvshereshth pariyon main se ek thi
 Yuvraj said, "this is probably my best innings

 Recently, many people got a message on Facebook and whatsapp that megastar Amitabh Bachchan has died
 is massej main bataaya gaya tha ki 23 farvari ko subah 11 bajshmitabh bachchanane is duniya ko alavida kah diya
 All of you pray for the peace of his soul
 times of india kii website par ai ek khabar ke anusaar is afvaah nabig bike phans ko khaasaa pareshaan kar diya or iske baad amitabh ke pravaktaa tak ko yah bayaan dena pad gaya ki vah bilkul thik hai or apane parivaar ke saath khush hai
 However, Amitabh Bachchan is not the first person to fall prey to such rumors
 dilip kumaar ko lekar bhi kuch samay pehle aisi afvaah udi thi
 At the same time, there were also rumors that Yo Honey Singh, Gul Panag, Lata Mangeshkar have died
 hollywood memrehana, britaini spirs, johny dep, tom hanks bhi in afvaahon kaa shikaar ho chuke hai
 Really, in such a time when internet and new technology have become our need, such misinformation can sometimes be fatal
 somvaar ko gujarat kii rajdhani gandhinagar main patel yaa patidaar aarakshan andolan ke liye raily yojit hui
 a similar rally was also held at Himmatnagar in Sabarkantha district of North Gujarat
 raily to shantipurna rahi lekin isane gujarat kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal laa diya he
 Patel society is demanding that they too be included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and the benefit of reservation
 yah andolan gujarat ke mahesena jile se kareeb ek maah pehle shuru hua, jahaan se pradhanmantri narendra modi or gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel bhi aati hai
 This movement with Mahesana has now spread to almost all the districts of Gujarat and is troubling the ruling BJP
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main patel samudaay pichley kai saalon se bhaajapa kaa samarthak mana jaataa he
 In 1985, Madhav Singh Solanki, the then Chief Minister of Congress, did a new experiment, which is known as 'kham'
 khaam yani kshatriya, dalit, adivasee or muslim
 Then the OBC reservation, but there was a lot of violence between the Patels and other backward classes
 patel tabhi se congress se naaraaz maane jate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the BJP is considered to be completely dominated by the Patels in Gujarat today
 yah baat isi se jaahir hoti he ki mukhyamantri anandiben patel or party adhyaksh aar si phaldu donon hi patel netaa hai
 That is why BJP is in awe of this movement and is trying to turn the movement to the other side
 tippaniyan Union Minister in Rajkot and bjp's Gujarat leader Mohan Kundaria alleged that the movement was inspired by the Congress
 jis tarah se yah andolan teji se puure rajya main pasar rahaa he, usase bhaajapa chintaa main he
 Elections for the Municipal Corporation and Municipality in Gujarat are to be held in October
 aise main agar bhaajapa ke janaadhar main naaraazgi aegi to chunaav main use iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 This is the reason that this whole matter is being considered politically sensitive
 lagaataar tej ho rahe andolan ke baavjood mukhyamantri anandiben patel is par maun saadhe hai
 Not only BJP, Congress is also silent on this issue, because any political statement on this issue can do more harm than good
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki aane vaale sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaavon main is andolan kaa koi prabhaav padataa he yaa nahin or yah andolan or kitna aage tak jaataa he
 The movement started about a month ago from Mahesana district of Gujarat, from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel also come
 mahesena ke saath yah andolan ab lagbhag gujarat ke sabhi jilon main pasar chukaa he or sattadhari bhaajapa ko pareshaan kar rahaa he
 Significantly, the Patel community in Gujarat has been considered a supporter of the BJP for the last several years
 san 1985 main congress ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri madhavsingh solanki ne ek nayaa prayog kiya tha, jise 'khaam' ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Kham means Kshatriya, Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim
 tab obisi aarakshan ko lekan patelon or anya pichde varg ke bich kaaphi hinsa hui thi
 Patel has since been considered angry with the Congress
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki aaj gujarat main bhaajapa par puri tarah se patelon kaa prabhutv mana jaataa he
 It is evident from this that both Chief Minister Anandiben Patel and party president RC Faldu are Patel leaders
 isi kaaran bhaajapa is andolan se sakate main he or andolan ko duusari ore modane kii koshish main juty he
 The comments rajkot main kendriya mantri or bhaajapa ke gujarat ke netaa mohan kundaria ne aarope lagaaya ki yah andolan congress dwaara prerit he
 The way this movement is spreading rapidly across the state, the BJP is worried
 gujarat main mahanagar palika or nagar palika ke chunaav oktober main hone hai
 In such a situation, if there will be resentment in the bjp's base, then it may have to bear the brunt of it in the elections
 yahi karaan he ki yah puraa maamla rajnatik taur par samvedansheel mana ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Anandiben Patel is silent on this despite the ever increasing movement
 sirf bhaajapa hi nahin, congress bhi is mudde par maun saadhe he, kyonki is mudde par koi bhi rajnatik bayaan phaayde se zyada nuksaan kar saktaa he
 It remains to be seen whether this movement has any influence in the upcoming local bodies elections and how far this movement goes

 The special thing is that the incident happened just outside the house of Jalandhar MP Vijay Sampla from Hoshiarpur

 After this he was taken to the hospital

 Now, by getting the votes of his nine members to the NDA candidate in the election of Deputy Speaker, he has opened the way for political discussion that both can come together till the 2019 Lok Sabha and Odisha Assembly elections
 yaa phir chunaav baad bijd endie kaa hissaa ho sakati he
 In fact, there was a close fight between the ruling party and the opposition in the election of the Deputy Chairman
 endie or upie donon kii najar bijd ke vot par thi
 There have been speculations that Patnaik may field his own candidate or he will walk out during the election

 BJP President Amit Shah and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh were in constant touch with Patnaik after the Janata Dal (U) was announced as NDA candidate
 minimum world, maximum work ke liye prasiddh patnayak unhen bas yahi ek line kahkar jawaab dete rahe, ''haa dekhte hai
 Both these leaders then gave a report to Narendra Modi
 or aakhirkaar modi ke phone karne ke baad patnayak raji ho gaye
 But the position of Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is called the bjp's face in Odisha, has become uncomfortable due to BJD standing in favor of Modi government
 rajya main bijd sarkaar ke 18 saal ko naakaam bataakar aakraamak rahane vaale pradhan ke saamne duvidha yah he ki ve apana aakraamak rukh jari rakhen yaa phir chuppi saadh len
 The state's BJP unit and its cadres have become politically troubled that if the central leadership joins hands with the BJD, then no matter how aggressive the party becomes in the state, the wrong message in the public will go wrong
 bhubaneshwar main party karyaalay main murajhaaye se baithe ek varisht kaaryakarta kehete hai, ''aisi sthiti main chunaav ke dauraan vot kaise maangenge
 "even though the BJD and BJP, who have done politics from 2000 to 2009, have been seen as each other's arch enemies in Odisha, Modi and Shah have been cursing Patnaik and his party with water from the forums, but Jugalbandi of both parties is well known in Delhi
 maukey-bemauke endie ke paksh main khadey hokar patnayak ne 2019 ke aam chunaav main bijd kii bhoomika ke saaf sanket die hai
 In such a situation, if the BJD goes in favor of the NDA before or after the Lok Sabha elections, it will not be a surprise
 bijd ne bhaajapa ke saath varsh 2000 or 2004 main lagaataar do baar saajha sarkaar banaaya tha
 Later, after the murder of Vishwa Hindu Parishad campaigner Lakshmanananda Saraswati in Kandhamal in 2008, the two began to suffer
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke dakhal ke kaaran donon kii dosti dushmani main badal gai
 From then on, the BJD continued to take the lead in the electoral fray
 yahaan tak ki 2014 main odisha modi lahar se bhi achoota rahaa
 However, after the formation of the government under Modi's leadership at the Center, the BJD became soft towards the Center
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav 21 main se 20 loksabhaa seat or vidhansabha chunaav main 147 main 117 vidhansabha seat hasil karke bijd sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari, par centre ke saath rishte madhur banaae rakhane main patnayak ne koi kami nahin chodi
 By amending the Mines and Mineral Development Regulation Act, BJD supported the Center in the UPA government's decision to cancel the allotted mining blocks, while this increased the Center's interference in mineral mines
 odisha ke 37 block ke patte nirast kiye gaye
 BJD also supported the Modi government in passing various Bills in the Rajya Sabha
 yahi nahin, patnayak ne sargical strike kii tarif kii thi or jiesti kaa khulaa samarthan karke ve centre sarkaar kii najar main rashtriya str par sudhaarwadi vyaktitv ke rup main ubhare
 In the presidential election too, BJD played a key role in winning the NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind by issuing a whip
 haalanki, upasabhapati ke pad par harivansh ke samarthan ko lekar tark yah diya ja rahaa he ki janata dal (you) ke netaa jaiprakash narayan andolan kii dein hai or donon partiyon kii siyaasi jaden judi hui hai
 But senior journalist and political analyst Ravidas says, "the BJP is aggressive towards the Patnaik government in the state, but there is something else at the center
 yah 2019 ke aam chunaav main samarthan paane kii ranneeti ho sakati he
 Recently, Patnaik has also praised the issue of National Citizenship (NRC) in Assam
 aise main congress vidhayak dal ke mukhya sachetak tara prasad bahinipati sawaal karte hai, ''congress or bhaajapa se samaan duuri banaae rakhane kaa patnayak kaa bayaan ab kahaan gaya? aarope lagane vaale achaanak shant kyon ho gaye? samaan duuri banaae rakhane kaa naveen mantra kahaan chalaa gaya?''haalanki bijd ke pravaktaa or sahakaarita tathaa naagarik aapurti mantri suryanarayan paatr kaa kahana he, ''donon dalon se samaan duuri ke bayaan par hamaare netaa kaayam hai, or bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 "but the difference between words and actions is beginning to be seen publicly
 vaise bhi raajnneeti main koi sthaayee dushman yaa dost nahin hota
 *** jeeyo 4G sarvice kii tahalaka machaa dene vaali lonching ke elaan ke baad reliance industry limited ke chairman mukesh ambani shuukravaar ko tirupati pahunche
 He offered prayers at Lord Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala
 mukesh ambanine mandir kii saptahik abhishek seva main hissaa liya
 He was presented with silk 'vastram' on behalf of the temple priests on the occasion
 bataa den ki mukesh ambani ne guuruuvaar ko mumbai main reliance industries kii 42veen salanaa aam baithak main apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat reliance jeeyo sarvice se karte hue kaha tha ki ham itihaas likhane ja rahe hai
 He also spoke of dedicating Reliance Geoservices to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the 120 crore people of the country
 america main kareeb ek karod log aise hai, jo rojaanaa do dollar kharch ke saath ji rahe hai
 His life goes with the help of food stamps, social welfare and free food and assistance provided by government schools
 yah baat brookings institution ke shodharthi laurence chandi ne kahi
 According to the news agency Effie, Chandy said, 'the lives of people living outside the money economy are very bad
 unhen kabhi bhi beemaari yaa maut daboch leti he
 'chandy in his study on the poor said that 4 in America
 6 karod log 16 dollar prati din kii garibi rekha se neeche rah rahe hai or do karod log prati din aath dollar par ji rahe hai
 According to Chandy, the special thing about this section is that these people are living only on social welfare on negligible income
 chandi ne apane adhyayan main kaha ki america main netaaon kaa mukhya dhyaan madhya varg par rahata he
 This reinforces the notion that the number of poor is small and temporary and the laborers will gradually prosper, but according to them the truth is that the journey from poverty to wealth has been very slow in the last half century
 Reliance jiofiber kaa elaan ho chukaa he
 All the plans of jiofiber have also come
 699 rupee se 8,499 rupee tak ke plan hai
 If you are fond of Netflix, Hotstar or other content apps and mostly watch movies and series on them, then some plans of jiofiber are not worth you
 jiofiber kaa ek bhi broadband plan aisa nahin he jisamen FUP na diya gaya ho
 All plans have FUP (fair Usage Policy)
 yani ek limit tak aap hai speed data yuj kar sakate hai
 However, it is not the case that your internet will stop after the data is over
 kyonki data khatm hone kebaad aapako 1mbps kii speed milti rahegi
 jiofiber broadband plans have an initial speed of 100mbps
 ye speed Netflix yaa Hotstar se lekar duusare contant eps ke liye kaaphi he
 But the speed of 1mbps that you will get after the data is over is not enough
 dhyaan rahe, sabhi plan kii jo keemte hai wo bina GST ke hai
 GST is separate
 699 rupee kaa plan aapke liye kaaphi nahib baat karte hai 699 rupee ke plan kii
 In this plan you will get 100mbps speed, but with this you will get only 100GB of data
 haalanki shuruaati opper ke taur par aapako chah maheene tak 50GB extra data milegaa
 In total, you are getting 150GB of data
 isaki validity 1 maheene kii he
 On Netflix, if you watch at least one movie every day, watch videos on youtube, browse the Internet
 to 150GB data ek maheene tak nahin chalegaa
 If you have a TV at home and watch Netflix on it
 everej har din 1 film rakh len phir bhi 699 rupee vaala plan aapke liye nahin he
 On Netflix, if you watch Standard Definition (SD) content for one hour, it takes 1GB of data
 vahiin agar aap echdi dekhte hai to ek ghante main 3GB data lagata he
 Keep an average of a movie for 2 hours every day
 film ke alaava video or browjing main 2GB data rakh len
 That is, together you are spending 8 to 10GB of data in a day
 30 din main aap 300GB data yuj karenge, lekin 699 rupee vaale plan main aapako 150GB hi data miltaa he
 That too will be 100GB after a few months
 isliye ye plan aapke liye nahin he
 Even if you are a basic Netflix user, this plan is not for you
 kya 849 kaa plan kaaphi he?ab baat karte hai 849 rupee ke plan kii
 200GB data is available in this plan
 shuruaati kuch maheenon ke liye aapako 200GB extra data milegaa
 That is, you will get total 400GB data
 agar aap aivarej Netflix yaa duusare video ap yujar hai to is plan ke tahat diya jane vaala data aapke liye kam pad jayega
 We mentioned above the data consumed by Netflix
 agar aap 4K TV par Netlfix yaa koi duusare contant eps yuj karte hai to 1 ghante main 7GB data khapat hoga
 Apart from this, internet browsing, youtube videos and gaming will consume around 3 to 4GB of data
 yani aap agar har din 10GB se 15GB data kii khapat kar rahe hai to maheene main aapako kam se kam 450GB data kii jarurat hogi jo is plan main nahin miltaa he
 Therefore this plan will not be enough for you
 1,299 rupee kaa planis plan ke tahat aapako 200mpbs kii speed milegi
 Talking about data limit, here you will get 500GB data
 shuruaati ofer ke tahat 250GB data extra milegaa
 That is, you are getting 750GB of data
 ye plan aapke liye he
 Because you are an average user, 750GB of data in a month is fine for you
 lekin aapke ghar main kai log hai, Netflix par har din siries dekh rahe hai, weekend par 10 apisod vaali siries khatm kar rahe hai
 In this case, this plan is also not for you
 aapako 2,499 rupee ke plan kii taraf dekhnaa hoga jisamen 2500GB data diya jaataa he
 Looking at all the plans of jiofiber, it seems that the company should have kept at least one or two plans in which there is no FUP
 kai broadband companiyaan hai jo bina FUP ke plance detii hai or unke packs bhi aakraamak keemat main aate hai
 Even if not every company gives you 100mbps speed, but content apps like Netlfilx - in plans above 10mbps, run quite well and nowadays companies are offering 50mbps plans a lot
 swine flu ne dekhte hi dekhte kareeb aadhe desh par maut kaa panja failaa liya he
 This is because, apart from paperwork and statements like 'keep faith', no government seems to take concrete steps to stop this at the ground level
 khaskar tab, jab swasthya mantralay yah kahe ki usase kisi bhi rajya ne abhi tak koi madad nahin maangi
 This is at a time when the caravan of death has reached 663 people and more than 10,000 people are battling this disease

 haalanki, ab jab is beemaari ne vikaraal rup dhaaran kar liya he to centre sarkaar kii bhi neend khuli he
 Union Health Minister JP Nadda said on Wednesday that there is no shortage of Tamiflu medicine in the country

 lekin mantralay ne apane bayaan main aage jo kaha vah chaunkaane vaala he
 The ministry said that there has been no demand from the states regarding medicines, test kits or other essential items
 yani agar aisa he to rajya sarkarein is babat kitni sanjeeda hai, iskaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 According to the central government, 10025 people have been affected by H1N1 virus so far this year
 madad bhul, aankadon main uljhi sarkaarcentre or rajyon se aa rahe aankadon main bhi kuch visangatiyaan saamne aa rahi hai
 For example, Central Government data shows that this year in Jammu and Kashmir the number of people affected by this virus is just three, while a senior health officer of the state said that at least one person has died and The disease has been confirmed in 70 people
 srinagar main sher-e-kashmir institute of medical sycenge ke nideshak shaukat jargar ne bataaya, 'abhi tak ech1en1 virus se peedit do rogiyon kii jaan ja chuki he or 71 anya rogiyon main is virus kii pushti hui he

 aise do dalon ko aaj madhya pradesh or maharashtra ravaanaa kiya gaya
 'the Ministry of Health has asked the states to conduct a study on such deaths, taking into consideration which age groups, which areas and under which circumstances such deaths occurred

 Now it has to be seen how successful the Prime Minister is in this new exercise
 sweden kii telecom upkaran banane vaali companyerixnnil ambaniki arcom ke khilaaf bharat kesupreme courtmen yachika daayar kar anil ambani or company ke do anya nideshkon ko bina ijaajat videsh jane se roke jane kii maang kii he
 The case will be heard on Thursday
 darasal anil ambani kireliancecomunications (arcom) par arikson company kaa 1100 karod rupee bakaayaa he
 The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had asked Reliance Communications (rcom) to give 550 crore to Ericsson by 30 September
 lekin NCLT ke aadesh ke baavjood reliance communications (arcom) tay raashi arikson ko dene main naakaam rahi
 Therefore, Ericsson has also demanded from the court that a contempt case should also be tried against them
 arikson kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki arcom desh ke kanoon kaa aadar nahin kar rahi or die aadesh ko halke main leti he, lihaaja court ke order ke bina inke desh ke baahar jane par roak lagani chahie
 In this case, Reliance Communications (rcom) said on Wednesday that it has got relief from the Telecom Tribunal and it can now complete its planned spectrum sale process
 bikri se praapt dhan kaa upyog arikson india ko bakaae kaa bhugtan karne main kiya jayega
 Significantly, Ericsson had signed a seven-year agreement in 2014 to operate and manage rcom's telecom network in India
 is dauraan arcom par arikson kaa 1100 karod kaa bakaayaa ho gaya
 Earlier in the hearing, rcom had told the Supreme Court that they would not be able to settle the property in case of bankruptcy
 isapar arikson ne bhi kaha tha ki uskaa bakaayaa milane tak arcom ko diwalia ghoshit karne kii karrwai shuru na kii jaae
 Today is the last day of campaigning in Delhi assembly elections
 dilli main ab bijepi kaa sabase bada cheharaa or siem pad kii ummidavaar kiran bedi subah-subah prachaar ke liye nikal padin
 He said that today is just a day to thank people and everyone
 vahiin aaj kejariwal ke sawaalon par kiran bedi bolne se bachati dikhin
 Bedi was pointing out that today she negative bayaan nahin dena chaahatin, lekin hameshaa kii tarah ek jaldbaazi main or sawaalon se aaj bhi bachati hi dikhin
 If i win, i will become Chief Minister, but what if i lose? He said, i have come to win not to lose
 mujhe koi jitaane ke liye laayaa he
 When Kiran Bedi's entry into the party on January 15, i was present at the BJP headquarters at 11 Ashok Road, she was feeling a bit nervous, her mind was clearly reflecting on her face
 bijepi ke do diggaj amit shah or arun jetali kii maujuudagi main unhen party main laayaa gaya vah bhi pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke baad
 The face of Delhi BJP, Dr
 harshavardhan, bijepi pradesh adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay jaise chehre is parachute entry par sirf man masos kar rah gaye
 For several days, reports of resentment continued in the party and the big leaders kept telling the news to the media and denied them
 kiran bedi shuruyaat main kaaphi mukhar raheen, lekin dhire-dhire party alaakaman ke ishaare ke baad unhone media ke saamne chuppi hi banaae rakhi or vah apane confort ke hisaab se jawaab detii raheen
 Asked questions on Kejriwal, she spoke openly, but if the question does not suit her, she would go from there saying that i have to go, meet people
 yah baat saaf he ki bijepi achche khaase dabaav main he or aaj aakiri din party sabhi 70 siton par prachaar ke liye saansadon, mantriyon ko utaar rahi he, pradhanmantri ne buudhvaar ko hi apni chauthi or aakhri raily khatm kii he
 PM Modi and Amit Shah took command of the campaign
 shah ne kai baar taiyaariyon par nakhushi bhi jataai, lekin party ke paas vaqt bahut kam tha or 'aap' kii chunauti usase kahin badi
 The BJP has done a lot in this election, which it has never done before, especially the strategy for campaigning was not seen anywhere other than Delhi, but till the last day the lack of coordination was seen in the party, especially Kiran Bedi
 There was always a confusion about the campaign schedule of K
 subah kii team ko nahin pataa shaam ko kahaan rahengi, shaam kii team ko nahin pataa is vaqt kahaan hongi
 Journalists like me kept on calling, but still there is no doubt that the BJP has given its full strength, but now it remains to be seen whether this struggle will be able to put the power of Delhi in its bag, but the movement of the day Will keep bringing you to you

 Recalling his school days, Modi said how Dena Bank had brought a scheme in those days under which students used to cheat and open their accounts
 pradhanmantri ne bataaya, 'unhone ek (gullak) mujhe bhi di lekin meraa hameshaa khaali rahata tha
 Later i left the village

 In response, Sanders said, "we have been told that the President has the power to take this decision
" " haalanki, sanders kaa yah bayaan kai kanoonee visheshgyon ke rukh se virodhabhasi he
 Experts say that if Trump wants to sack Muller, he will have to get permission from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
 rod ne hi roosi jaanch kaa netritv karne ke liye mular ko namit kiya tha
 Sanders said the White House did not agree with the argument that only Rosenstein had the authority to sack Muller
 sanders ne kaha ki white house ne apane kanoonee visheshgyon or nyaay vibhaag ke karmiyon kii salaah lee he
 Rosenstein has the responsibility to oversee the work of Special Prosecutor Muller in the Russian investigation case since US Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped down in March 2017

 This raid took place in the cemetery

 People say that after coming to the cemetery, the worldly story always ends forever
 insaan pehle laash
 Then the skeleton and finally the story itself
 magar chennai kii kahani ek kabr se shuru hoti he
 Story of human crime
 kahani herapheri kii
 Story of human greed
 wo kahani, jo isse pehle naa kabhi suni gai naa sunai gai
 The people of the department themselves are able to hear this story
 kabr kii kahani, kabristaan kaa rahasy28 janvari 2019 kaa din
 The Income Tax Department gets the news that the owners of Tamil Nadu's famous Sarvana store, Lotus Group and Zee Square have recently bought 180 crore property in Chennai through cash
 or wo is deal ko chhupaakar tex kii herapheri kar rahe hai
 The news was so sure that the Income Tax Department prepared several teams to raid 72 locations of these companies in Chennai and Coimbatore
 or subah se hi iskar vibhaag kii team in companiyon ke thikaanon par chaape maarane lageen
 But the Income Tax officials felt nothing
 naa rupee
 No jewelry
 naa paper
 On 6 February 2019, Chennai Income Tax Department could not believe how it happened that despite having such strong information about the owner of these three companies, their operation failed
 unke haath kuch nahin laga
 The department was so confident of its information that instead of believing it to be a failure, they got involved in the investigation of how their raid failed
 mukhabiron ko active kiya gaya
 Hundreds of cctvs were checked in the city
 kol detail khangaali gayi
 It was then discovered that an SUV vehicle was roaming around on the streets unnecessarily on January 28, that day
 jisaki footage dekhakar department ko shaq hua
 CCTV was searched, but it took a long time, however the next day the police arrested the SUV and its driver
 7 farvari 2019, subah kaa vaqt, chennaihar taraf sannata
 As in the cemetery
 magar is sannaate ko chirati syran kii awaz
 Because on receiving the news, the team of Income Tax Department entered a cemetery in Chennai in the morning
 unke saath us esayuvi kaa driver bhi tha, jo 28 janvari ko puure din apni gaadi ko shahar main ghuma rahaa tha
 After his arrest, he was interrogated overnight
 or is vakt bhi wo kabristaan main iskar vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke saath aayaa tha
 The driver pointed to a grave among hundreds of graves
 uske ishaara karte hi puraa department us kabr kii taraf daud padaa
 Employees gathered with shovel, spade and shovel
 aanan fanan main kabr ko khoda gaya
 Then when the tomb was removed and the picture was shown
 usne vahaan khadey iskar ke tamaam adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke hosh uda die
 The officers, employees and policemen of the Income Tax Vibhad now stood in front of that grave
 jisamen murda nahin khazaana dafn tha
 The entire treasury of 433 crores
 isamen kareeb 25 karod rupee nakad, 12 kilo sona or 626 carat heere the
 But the question was that the Income Tax authorities had raided 72 locations to find the treasure
 wo aakhir ek kabr main kaise aayaa
 Who leaked the intelligence information of Income Tax Department's Reds? So all these questions were answered by the driver who was wandering on the streets of Chennai all day with black money
 pehali baar aisi karrwichennai or coimbatore main jo ho rahaa tha wo shaayad is desh ke itihaas main pehali baar tha
 The story of this Red from the Income Tax Department was like a South Indian film
 lekin yahaan par jo hua wo film kii kahani na hokar sach tha
 Inside the tomb when soil was removed from the tomb at the driver's behest
 kareeb 25 karod rupee nakad, 12 kilo sona or 626 carat ke heere baraamad kiye gaye
 When the Income Tax Department extracted the total value of all these things, the price was Rs 433 crore
 yani is kabr ke neeche puraa kaa puraa khazaana dafn tha
 Treasury worth 433 crores
 kabr se niklaa arabon kaa khajaanaye wo khazaana tha jo inakam tex department 28 janvari ko chennai or coimbatore main 72 jagahon par chaape markar khojna chaah rahaa tha
 But the owners of the three big companies, Sarvana Store, Lotus Group and Zee Square, who were involved in this rigging, had already crossed it
 paison kii herapheri ke alaava iti exparts kii madad lekar in logon ne computer se record bhi hataa diya or paison ko ek esayuvi gaadi main chhupaakar shahar main puure din ghumaane ke baad jab chupaane kii koi jagah nahin mili to use ek nazadiiki kabristaan main ek kabr main aise chupa diya
 As the corpse is kept there after dying
 taaki unki is chori bhanak bhi kisi ko na lage
 The SUV was roaming in the car, despite the fact that the department had not found much in the income tax raid on January 28, despite strong news
 aisa isliye kyonki sutron ke mutabik companiyon ko chapa padane kii khabar kuch police waalon se pehle hi lag gai thi
 And after getting the information about the red fall, the owners of the three companies started running on the streets of Chennai, hiding most of the money, gold and diamonds in an SUV
 is gaadi main jo saamaan tha, uski kul keemat 433 karod rupee ke kareeb thi
 The driver opened the Rajyakar officers, after this failed raid, it was found that the department was raiding
 thik usee vakt ek esayuvi car chennai kii sadakon par lagaataar chakkar maar rahi thi
 Which had a lot of black money and jewelery
 jiske baad is esayuvi car kii talash kii gai or aakhirkaar police kii madad se use dhund bhi nikaala gaya
 But the police and income tax officials did not find anything in this vehicle
 lekin jab is car ke driver se sakhti se poochtacha kii gai to usne khulaasa kiya ki usne ek kabristaan main kai saare bore chhupaae hai jisamen cash
 There are jewels and diamonds
 iske baad iskar adhikariyon ne driver kii nishandehi par kabristaan main us kabr kii khudaai shuru karai
 In which the driver had said to hide the treasure
 khudaai main iskar adhikariyon ko kareeb 25 karod rupee nagad, 12 kilo sona or 626 carat kii heere baraamad hue hai
 The operation, which started on January 28, ended after 9 days
 is oparation ke khatm hone ke baad iskar adhikari philhal computer se delit kiye gaye data ko waapas lene ke liye iti profeshnal kii madad le rahe hai
 So that the owners of these three companies can disclose the recently purchased 180 crore property in Chennai through cash

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) On the issue of terrorism, America has given strict warning to Pakistan and said that if there is a further terrorist attack on India, it can become a big problem for it
 pakistan ko aagaah karte hue america ne saaf kar diya he ki use aatanki sanghathanon par thos karrwai kerani hogi
 The US gave a strong message to Pakistan, saying that Pakistan will have to take strong action, especially against terrorist organizations like jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba
 washington main white house ke ek varisht adhikari ne buudhvaar ko bataaya ki pakistan ko aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karne kii jarurat he
 In order to avoid any tension in the indo-pakistan region, it is necessary that Pakistan should take strict measures against jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba
 america ne kaha he ki agar halaat bigadate hai to donon deshon ke liye khatarnaak honge
 Please tell that Jaish-e Mohammed is that terrorist organization, which targeted a convoy of CRPF personnel in Pulwama on February 14 and killed 40 soldiers in it
 is hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan par airstrike kar vahaan maujuud aatanki thikaanon ko dhwast kiya tha
 India has also submitted evidence to Pakistan for action on the culprits of Pulwama
 america adhikari ne ye bhi kaha ki pichley kuch dinon main pakistan ne shuruaati ection liye hai, jisamen aatanki sanghathanon kii sampattiyaan jabt kii gai hai or unki giraftaaryaan bhi hui hai
 Pakistan has also captured some key Jaish targets
 lekin ham isse kaaphi zyada ection dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The US has clearly told Pakistan that in the past, steps like arrest have been taken by Pakistan, but later these terrorists are released
 yahaan tak ki aatank ke aakaaon ko puure desh main ghoomane kii bhi ijaajat mil jaati he
 In such a situation, Pakistan will now have to take concrete action
 balakot main bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke baad pakistan kii ore se uthaae gaye kadamon ke bare main puche jane par white house ke adhikaar ne kaha ki america or antarrashtriya samudaay dekhnaa chahta he ki aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf thos or nirnaayak karrwai ho
 "it is too early to do a full assessment of the steps taken by Pakistan right now," the official said
 haal ke dinon main pakistan ne kuch shuruaati kadam uthaae hai
 For example, the assets of some terrorist organizations have been seized and some have been arrested and some of Jaish's hideouts have been taken over by the administration
 lekin in kadamon ke alaava abhi pakistan kii ore se bahut kuch kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The change in the definition of sex in the last two decades in this country can be directly linked to the increasing urbanization

 This change is not only happening in the physical field, but also in the mental field

 jab mujhse india today ke taaja sex surveykshan par likhane ko kaha gaya to mujhe kuch hafte pehle kii ek ghatana yaad aa gai
 i was waiting for my friend in a coffee house to hear a conversation going on at the table behind me: a boy was asking a girl sitting together, "what are you saying, condoms hit your mother's hand 
 '' ladki ne jawaab diya, ''bevakoof, tumne unhen mere bag main chhod diya tha
 "he asked without panicking," then what did he say
 '' ladki ne hansate hue bataaya, ''kuch nahin
 
 
 They at least believe that i have safe sex
 ''maine anjaan banate hue peeche sir ghumaya to dekha ki ve college main padhane vaale bisek saal ke do yuva the
 He looked at me and laughed out loud
 unhen jaraa bhi jhenp nahin hui, balki mere chehre par chaunk jane ke bhav ko dekhakar unhen jaise majaa aa rahaa tha
 Maybe i will be ten years older than him, but i feel a big change in this small difference of age
 india today ke sex surveykshan, 2011 main puraani peedi ke soch par gaur kiya gaya he
 Most respondents in the survey are those who are over 25 years of age, whose marriages (mostly decided by parents) are over 20 years old and have children
 matlab yah ki surveykshan saamaanya or niyamit parivaar ke sexgat vyavhaar or sex ke bare main unke soch ko ujagaar karata he
 On the one hand, it seems that there has not been any significant change in this matter in India in the last decade
 lagbhag aadhi aabaadi ab bhi shaadi se pehle sex ko galat maanati he
 Men are living more satisfied lives than women from the perspective of sex
 mahilaayein aaj bhi apane purush mitra, premi yaa pati ke prati apekshaakrit zyada vafaadaar hai
 Around 71 percent of women have had only one male in their entire sex life, while 37 percent of men have had more than one woman in their sex life
 sexgat vyavhaar main shaharikaran kii bhi ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Most men (55 per cent) and women (43 per cent) believe that women who are employed are the main reason for having extramarital or relationships with more than one partner
 jab unase unke jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon ke bare main poocha gaya to uttardaataaon kaa jawaab tha ki rojgaar, swasthya, saamaajik jivan, paisa or yahaan tak ki bhaavnaatmak jivan sex kii apeksha zyada santoshjanak rahaa he
 In the last decade, men and women magazines, whether they are in health, started discussing sex life and gave suggestions and ideas on sex
 ye patrikaayen kishoron or vayaskon main vishesh rup se lokapriy maani jaati hai
 They discuss sexual fantasies, work information, tips and games to make the reader's sex life playful
 udaar purv, yaa 'svachhand' pashchim ke ulat bharat apni sex niti ke maamle main ekadam spasht he
 Neither pornography nor poor Savita Bhabhi, nor sex shops and sex toys at all

 isse yah jaahir hota he ki bharat kii aabaadi kaa ek chota-sa hissaa shahari he, usne duniya dekhi he, vah is tarah kii partiyon se anbhigya nahin he
 That is why he was not surprised to see this in a Bollywood film
 is surveykshan se yah bhi jaahir he ki kaam karne vaale mata-pita ko apane bacchon ko vipareet sex vaale saathiyon ke saath dosti karne main koi aapatti nahin he
 Unlike traditional cities, metros like Bangalore and Mumbai are more liberal in terms of sex
 duusare bade shaharon ke mukaable bangaloru main samalingi sambandhon, ek raat kaa saath or ek saath rah rahe avivaahit jodon ko apekshaakrit zyada sweekaaryata hasil he
 Sex Survey: Despite the Arya Samaj, inside the minds of young people known for photographs, widows do not accept marriage as a category
 surveykshan ke mutabik, aabaadi kaa ek chota lekin mahatvapurn hissaa vidhwaa or talakshuda mahilaon ke punarvivaah ko pasand nahin karata he
 From this survey, it is evident that in the country where HIV cases are increasing, parents of children below 18 years of age remain unaware of the trend towards sex in youth
 sirf ek-chauthai uttardaataaon ne mana ki unke bachche sex main lipt ho sakate hai
 Most of those who believe that their children are involved in sex ignore it
 kareeb 80 fisadi vayask aabaadi apane bacchon se sex ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chaahati
 And then there are some states like Karnataka which oppose sex education in school
 sex survey 2011: fanda mata-pita kaashayad zyaadaatar logon ko pataa nahin he ki bharat duniya ke un deshon main se ek he, jahaan kishor umr main garbhvatee hone vaali ladakiyon kii sankhya sabase zyada he
 But this does not surprise anyone as most of them are married, whereas in 'lumpet West' it is considered 'irresponsible behavior and freedom of adolescents'
 is surveykshan ke mutabik, mata-pita ko jab pataa bhi chal jaataa he ki unke bachche sex main lipt hai to ve unhen fatkaar lagaate hai yaa jaan-boojhkar ankhen moond lete hai
 Only one-third of parents talk to their children about this and educate them
 zyaadaatar uttardaata apane bacchon ke saamne apni patni yaa pati ke prati pyaar jaahir karne se hichakate hai
 There is limited interaction between parents and children on the subject of sex
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki kishoron kii badi sankhya dohari jindagi jiti he or jab mata-pita ko unke sex jivan ke bare main pataa chalata he to ve hairaan rah jate hai
 Children resort to the Internet due to lack of social contact and no information from parents on the subject of sex
 abhibhavakon ko amuman isaki jaankaree nahin hoti ki bachche internet par kya dekhte hai
 The result is that they start watching porn sites
 un site par aakarshith karne ke iraade se sex ko baazaaroo cheez ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 They emphasize lust and fulfillment rather than intimacy, and children probably form their first opinions about sex
 isiilie hamen aksar bacchon main sex sambandhi ghatnaon kii khabaren sunne ko milti hai
 25% of the respondents who had sex with their relatives reported that they had been forced to do so
 unamem se aadhe ne bataaya ki yah sex kaa unka pehla anubhav tha, jo puraa jivan sex kii unki samaj ko prabhavit karegaa
 In Bangalore, you can see 12 or 13-year-olds in bars or discos and their parents have no idea what their children are doing
 bharat main vivaah ke saath pavitrataa ko jodakar dekha jaataa he, lekin in shaharon main yuvaaon kaa vyavhaar vivaah sanstha ko zyada mahatv detaa nahin lagata he
 Bangalore is one of the cities where most respondents believe they have paid for sex
 bees fisadi uttardaata mahasoos karte hai ki ek hi sahabhaagi ke saath baar-baar sex se man ub jaataa he
 Similarly, respondents in Hyderabad and Mumbai believe that there is no problem in having extramarital affairs
 surveykshan ke zyaadaatar nattejey anpekshit nahin hai
 If we know anything, it is that despite the spread of media and information, the average middle class Indian is still cautious and apprehensive about sex
 lekin sex ke prati duusare bharat kii maansikta kaa adhyayan jaruri he
 Psychologists advising in school-colleges point to increased freedom among youth
 yuvaaon kaa surveykshan shaayad ek alag bharat kii tasviir saamne rakhega

 gadde se hui maut par ghiri dilli sarkaar ko or girte hue dilli congress ne anokhe tareeke se virodh kiya he

 upar se pradarshan ke dauraan congressiyon kii gadiyon kii vajah se vahaan par lanbaa jam lag gaya
 However, when the question was asked to the Congress leaders about this, the road was quickly vacated
 mukhyadharaor usase alag sahitya kaa vibhaajan galat he, likhane valasahityakarhota he chaahe vah kaisaa bhi likh rahaa ho, basharte public use pasand kare
 These things were done by the famous novelist Surendra Mohan Pathak
 unhone aage kaha ki unki safalataa se jalane vaale logon ne vibhaajan kii aisi lakeer khinchi
 He challenged that he could write like litterateurs but someone who wrote like him
 apane upar lugdi sahityakar ke akshep par unhone kaha ki lugdi kii takat se hi yah sambhav hua ki 10 rupee ke kaagaj par 250 pej chap jate the
 While it would have cost Rs 250 to print so many pages on good paper
 lugdi kaagaj kii vajah se hi aam logon ke gharon main unke upanyaas pahunch paae
 He said that if you want to make everyone your enemy, then write your autobiography
 aarushi murder par unhone kaha ki sarkari jaanch ko maanane kaa man nahin karata
 He said that he is a believer in the tradition and cannot believe in any way that the parents killed a minor girl
 apane bare main unhone bataaya ki jasusi, detective or krime ke kirdaar likhane se unki jivan bahut defective ho gaya he
 He said that writing this makes life very dirty
 vah bahut darpok shaks hai, unhone kabhi laash nahin dekhi, khun nahin dekha, hathiyaar nahin chalaaya lekin likhnaa padataa he, raat ko unhen inhen ke sapane aate hai
 In response to Shamsatheer Khan's questions, he said that first he wanted to become a journalist, if he could not, then he gave birth to the character of journalist Sunil and wrote 122 novels on it
 is madhyam se unhone apni sari hasaraten puri kar leen
 Today, if one of the characters has to be alive, then he would like to make Sunilo alive
 vairieti badalane ke liye unhone detective ko hero banaaya
 But he got the most fame by making the criminal a hero
 65 lakh kii dakaiti 22 baar chapa, angreji or gujarati main bhi
 He also told that a person came to his house after killing his wife
 kai log tip bhi lene aate the
 He gave the example of Samuel Johnson, saying that no matter what he writes, he writes for money
 unhone kaha ki aaj 3 kaarobaar hai jisamen glamer he
 First fashion, second journalism and third cinema
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki logon ke kehane par unhone apniotobiographylikhi
 But if everyone wants to be their enemy then only you should write autobiography
 bigadati kanoon vyavastha par unhone kaha ki angrej raaj kaa danda majboot tha, 8 kimi main ek thana hota tha
 One soldier went and caught 8 people
 aaj 8 jate hai or pitakar laut aate hai
