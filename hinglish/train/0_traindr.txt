 He kept saying repeatedly that the government of Lucknow would have to be changed, only then something would happen

 Mentioned my stay in Bundelkhand and said that i made long trips here
 aaj machharon or pani kaa zikr nahin hua
 The stories of mother and grandmother were not mentioned
 bas baar-baar yuvaaon se poocha gaya ki aapako naukari mili
 Road was found, electricity was found

 The corruption which used to be in closed rooms, has now come out
 koun laayaa is kanoon ko
 No, speak loudly, who brought this law
 sabase bada kanoon ham laae
 Right to food
 yahaan jo mahilaayein baithi hai
 They understand

 Their heart aches when their children go hungry

 Two editors of Zee News - Sudhir Chaudhary and Sameer Ahluwalia - arrested for trying to extort Rs 100 crore from Naveen Jindal's company for not showing the news, have been sent to jail for 14 days in judicial custody
 aaj donon patrakaron ko dilli ke saket court main pesh kiya kiya gaya, jahaan se unhen jail bhej diya gaya
 Simultaneously, the Crime Branch has asked nine senior editors and operators of Zee News to cooperate in the investigation and ask them to record their statements
 isse pehle zee ke in sampadakon ko do din kii police remand par bheja gaya tha
 Today both journalists were produced in Saket Court in Delhi, from where they were sent to jail
 isi ke saath krime branch ne zee news ke nau varisht sampadakon or sanchalko ko jaanch main sahyog dene ke liye kaha he or unase apane-apane bayaan darj karwaane ke liye kaha he
 Earlier, these editors of Zee were sent on two days police remand
 soshal media par ek viral post ke jariye daawa kiya gaya he ki madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ne rahul gandhi ko bhagwaan shiv kaa avatar kaha he
 It is written in the post that Kamal Nath said 'rahul Gandhi' is an incarnation of Lord Shiva
 tabhi kisi ne kaha jehar dekar check kar lo kyonki baad main saboot maangate hai log
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the matter written in the post is false
 kamalnath ne kabhi bhi aisa bayaan nahin diya he
 This post has been shared by the Facebook page 'achhe Din' which has been shared by more than five thousand people so far
 is pej ko fasebuk par 15 lakh se bhi zyada log follow karte hai
 Some more Facebook pages are also sharing this post
 internet par hamen aisi koi report nahin mili jisamen kamalnath ke is bayaan kaa zikr kiya gaya ho
 It is difficult to be such that Kamal Nath should make such a statement and he should not be covered anywhere
 agar kamalnath aisa bayaan dete bhi to vipaksh use mudda jarur banaata
 When India Today spoke about this
 pra congress se sampark kiya to unhone is post ko niraadhaar bataaya
 m pra congress ke media cordinator narendra saluja ne hamen bataaya ki rahul gandhi shivbhakt hai lekin kamalnath ke naam se chalaaya ja rahaa yah bayaan jhootha he
 However, in December 2017, some Congressmen in Allahabad had called Rahul Gandhi as Neelkanth avatar of Lord Shiva
 lekin kamalnath kii taraf se aisa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he

 congress ne 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton kaa chalan band karne ke sarkaar ke 'achaanak' kiye gaye faisle par kai sawaal khadey kiye or chintaa jataai ki yah kaarobaariyon, chote vyapaariyon or gruhaniyon ke liye bahut samasyaayein paidaa karegaa
 The party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, clarified that the party will always support 'meaningful, clear and precise' steps on the issue of black money
 unhone yah bhi sawaal kiya ki kya pradhanmantri videsh main jamaa 80 lakh karod rupee kaala dhan laane main unki 'naakaami' ko dhankane ke liye hi is yojana ko laae hai
 On the other hand, according to the news from Kolkata, targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue, the Congress and the CPI (M) said that this decision will have a big impact on the financial condition of the middle class and small businessmen
 tippaniyan CPI (M) politburo member Mohammad Salim said that we are always in support of the black money issue, but after two and a half years of silence on the issue, the Center suddenly decided to withdraw 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 yah behuda he
 This decision will have a big impact on small businessmen and the middle class
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) party ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne haalanki spasht kiya ki party hameshaa kaale dhan ke mudde par 'arthpurna, spasht or sateek' kadamon kaa samarthan karegi
 He also questioned whether the Prime Minister brought this scheme only to cover his 'failure' to bring in black money of Rs 80 lakh crore deposited abroad
 udhar, kolkata se mili khabar ke anusaar, is mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress or makapa ne kaha ki is faisle kaa madhyam varg or chote kaarobaariyon kii vittiya sthiti par bada asar hoga

 The doctors on strike had not received salary for the last three months

 apollo credele ne kaha ki is avasar par manoranjak gatividhiyon ke saath hi pairon kaa spa, photo, manoranjan or doctoron se salaah shaamil he
 Take care of the health of the mother, who sacrificed her health on her
 Mothers are superheroes who run the responsibilities of taking care of the family for years after the birth of the child
 sabaki ummiido par khara utarane ke liye vah sirf apana aaraam hi nahin, balki apni sehat bhi qurbaan kar detii hai
 In such a situation, it is your turn to take care of mother's health
 maiks aspataal, saket orthopedics kii diarector ramnik mahajan ne kaha ki bhartiya mahilaayein 50 kii umr tak pahunchate-pahunchate ghutane or bone maas kaa dijanareshan kii samasya se jujhane lagati hai
 The cause of early arthritis in Indian women is due to nutritional deficiency and obesity
 yahaan pesh he ramnik mahajan kaa suzav jise apanaakar maataaon kaa behatar khyaal rakh sakate hai
 1
 jald pahachaanen chetavanee sanket :aapane kai baar apni maa ko jodon ke dard, akadan ko lekar shikaayat karte hue or phir umr badhane kaa sanket maanakar ise nazarandaaj karte hue dekha hoga
 In such a situation consult a specialist
 ghutanon main subah-subah dard, akadan, loking evam popping se shuruyaat hone se lekar jodon main sujan hone tak, yah arthritis ke sanket ho sakate hai joki ek pragatisheel joint sthiti he or adhiktar bhartiya mahilaayein in sanketon ko nazarandaaj karti hai
 2
 sahi samay par pahchaan :mahilaayein tabhi doctor ke paas jaati hai jab yah sthiti aise stage main pahunch jaati he jab dard asahneeya ho jaataa he
 Remember that the loss of joints due to delay can increase manifold
 yadi iskaa shuruaati charnon main ilaaj ho jaae, to paaramparik upachaaron kii madad se is sthiti ko badhane main vilamb kiya ja saktaa he
 3
 vajan par najar :overvet hona bhartiya mahilaon main arthritis hone ke sabase pramukh jokhim ghatakon main se ek he
 Our joints are somewhat designed to lift weights
 prayek 1 kilo atirikt vajan ghutanon par chaar guna dabaav daal saktaa he
 Excess weight can damage joints, so proper weight means healthy joints
 4
 30-minute speech: a 30-minute walk every day can be beneficial for the health of bones and joints
 5
 Take minor injuries seriously: We often ignore minor injuries around the joints
 isse hanikaarak sthitiyaan paidaa ho sakati hai, jaise bhavishya main arthritis ho saktaa he
 If pain is recurring, consult a specialist
 ham aksar aise marijon ko dekhte hai jahaan joint injuri joint dijanareshan kaa kaaran ban jaati hai
 6
 sharir ke poshchar par rakhen najar :galat poshchar se jodon, khaastaur se ghutane par atirikt boj padataa he
 Knees are the most weight bearing joints in the body
 isse ghutane main dard ho saktaa he
 Keeping correct postures, taking frequent breaks during work, stretching regularly and correcting your postures intermittently helps reduce knee pain
 7
 Say no to painkillers: Taking drugs by yourself is a common problem in our country
 aamtaur par, ham aksar sharir main dard hone par doctor se salaah liye bina penkilors kaa sahaara lete hai
 Painkillers may give us immediate relief from pain, but they do not cure the condition
 isse kai ko-morbid sthitiyaan paidaa ho sakati hai isliye yadi aap apni mom ko jodon ke dard ke liye khud se penkilors lete hue dekhen, to fouran othorpedist ke paas jaakar unka pareekshan karaaen
 The recruitment of 68,500 assistant teachers in the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh is under the scanner of the CBI
 yogiraj ke paune do saal ke shashan main ye sabase badi bhartee thi or usee par sawalia nishaan lagane lage hai
 The government seems to be standing in defense rather than facing the CBI probe
 aise main yogi sarkaar par sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 However, while in opposition, the BJP staged a protest along with raising questions about the recruitments made during the Akhilesh government
 lekin ab unheen ke sarkaar ke daaman par daag laga he or sapa yogi sarkaar ko bhrashtachari sarkaar bataa rahi he
 The corrupt face of the Yogi government comes to the fore: SPASP spokesman Sunil Sajan said while talking to Aaj Tak that the recruitment of 68,500 teachers in Uttar Pradesh is part of a string of corruption of the Yogi government
 pradesh jin afasaron ke daaman par pradesh yuvaaon ke bhavishya ke saath khilwaad karne kaa aarope laga yogi sarkaar unheen ke dwaara jaanch kara rahi thi
 This proves that the government is involved in this entire corruption
 unhone kaha ki shikshak bhartee main jis tarah se paas abhyarthiyon ko jaanboojhkar fail kiya gaya or manamaane tareeke se apane logon kii bhartee kii gai
 In this case, many officers will go to jail from the education minister
 court ne jin 6 sawaal khadey kiye hai, usase yogi sarkaar kii asaliyat logon ke saamne aa gai he
 Why Sarkar Yogi government is running away from CBI, now instead of conducting CBI investigation of teacher recruitment, preparing to appeal in double bench to challenge the order
 guuruuvaar ko der raat mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii apper mukhya sachiv basic shiksha dow

 Prabhat Kumar told the media that the government will protect those who have received appointment letters
 unhone kaha ki 68,500 sahaayak shikshak bhartee kii sibiai jaanch karaane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Because the high level investigation of recruitment has been conducted by the government itself and no criminal act has been revealed in it
 shunya ank milane par court gai thim sonikabta den ki 68,500 sahaayak shikshakon kii bhartee main baari gadabadiyon ko dekhte hue elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu khandpeeth ne isaki jaanch sibiai ko saunp di he
 CBI has been asked to complete the investigation in 6 months
 pariksha main dhaandhliyon, baar code ke baavjood uttar pustikaayen badalane or sahi javaabon par bhi shunya ank dene ke khilaaf court main sonika devi kii yachika samet kul 41 yachikaayen daayar kii gai thi
 Justice Irshad Ali, while hearing all the petitions together, said that the disturbances in the examination violate the three fundamental rights of expression, life and equality
 badi sankhya main aise abhyarthiyon ke maamle saamne aae, jinhen 65 number die gaye
 Despite correct answers to his 3-4 questions, he got zero marks, which left him out of the selection
 sonika devi kaa to jaanboojhkar chayan nahin kiya gaya, in maamalon ko nyaayik jaanch ke daayre se baahar nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market in the country has expanded by 12 per cent

 report ke mutabik, us avadhi main seemaa ke aar-paar emende kii sankhya 293 rahi, jo kul 17
 Were worth $ 8 billion
 yah mulya 2012-13 kii apeksha 20 fisadi adhik he
 In these deals, the number of purchases of Indian companies by foreign companies and their total value was higher than other classes, because foreign companies took interest in buying Indian companies by taking advantage of the weakness in the rupee
 report ke mutabik, 'videshi companiyon dwaara bhartiya companiyon ke vilay yaa adhigrahan kaa kul mulay 10
 9 billion dollars, up 8 from the year-ago trading year

 This was one army rule we all strictly lived by, through the Shoot of the Film
 Once in costume, each and every one of us was responsible for our own gears
 You wear them or hold them, it's going to be with you through the span of the shoot for that day
 Our pockets would be full of protein bars, nuts and bags with bottles of energy drinks, because deep in those jungles sometimes no food trolleys or spot team were allowed to reach
 Somedays i would wake up with my right index finger already bent imitating to pull the trigger
 Those night shoots full of intense action, ofcourse were peppered with some fun banter and laughs in between shots amongst the boys, where our director @adityadharfilms would also join us
 All of this feels worth it, with the generous love the Film is getting from you all
 We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for keeping the Josh so high
 Also, a big shout out to the wonderful set of co-actors i got to work with, that formed our SF team

 It's not just a line anymore, you all have turned it into an emotion

 The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, in its order of 98 pages, said that inaction in this regard can lead to undesirable perception that India is a soft country and one can easily escape by interfering with tax laws
 nyaayaadhikaran ne vin chaddha ke putr kii apil ko khaarij karte hue yah aadesh diya
 The Income Tax Department claimed Rs 52 crore 85 from his father as taxes for 1987–88 and 1988–89
 nyaayaadhikaran ne apane aadesh main 1986 main hue 1437 karod rupee ke saude main top banane vaali company dwaara kisi bichauliye ke hone se inkaar kiye jane kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, efforts are made to open several accounts by Quarterdeck for transferring funds

 57 crores AE Services Ltd

 The fact has come to light that despite the Government of India insisting on not appointing any agent and not paying anyone, Bofors entered into a fresh advisory agreement with AES Services of Britain at the behest of Quattrocchi
 aadesh main kaha gaya he ki yah raashi 5,04,63,966 swedish kronar thi, jo bharat sarkaar dwaara di gai agrim raashi kii teen fisadi he
 This was in line with the agreement reached between Bofors and AE Services in November 1985
 aarasi sharma or arapy tolani kii do sadasyeey peeth ne kaha ki vin chaddha or un sambandhit companiyon par bharat main kar dendaree he, jinke jariye kwatrochi ko kamishan diya gaya
 According to the order, the department should have carefully examined their tax liability and appropriate action should have been taken for assessment and collection of tax

 com / y3h7tcas2h There is a ruckus about Yogendra Yadav's tweet, but he needs to look carefully
 unhone likhaa he, 'congress ko khatm ho janaa chahie
 If she failed to stop BJP in these elections to protect the idea of india, then this party has no positive role in Indian history
 aaj kisi vikalp ke nirmaan main ye sabase badi baadha kii pratinidhi he
 When people felt that Yogendra Yadav was denying any positive role of the Congress, he again clarified that he was not talking about the historical contribution of the Congress in the past, it was discussing its role in the coming days
 baharhaal yah pehali baar nahin he jab kisi ne congress ke khatme kii zarurat bataai ho
 It is now well known that Mahatma Gandhi had first suggested to end the Congress and replace it with a Lok Sevak Sangh
 gandhi ji kii hatya ke baad congress ke bheetar yah mudda uthaa bhi, lekin swatantraaa prapti ke tatkaal baad upji hui paristhatiyaan aisi nahin rah gai thim ki congress ke visarjan kii koi ruparekha ban paati
 After this, the suggestion of ending the Congress did not come, but it was predicted many times to end
 1967 main jab pehali baar nau rajyon main gaiyrcongressi sarkarein baniin tab kaha gaya ki congress khatm ho gai he
 When the Congress was broken in 1969, it was said that the Congress would no longer survive
 1977 main indira gandhi kii haar ke baad to maan liya gaya ki congress vaaki khatm ho chuki he
 After the death of Indira Gandhi in 1984, it was assumed that the Congress would no longer return
 1996 main narsingh raav kii sarkaar girane or gathbandhan raajnneeti kaa daur shuru hone ke saath baqayada bhavishyavaanee kii gai ki ab to congress kii vaapasi asambhav he
 After 1998, the newcomer Sonia Gandhi in politics was made fun of in almost the same way as Rahul Gandhi has been made in the last few years
 lekin congress baar-baar kisi chamatkaar kii tarah jivit ho jaati rahi
 The socialism of philosopher-politician like Lohia was left behind and the Congress, which nationalized the banks, coal mines and poverty removal, moved forward
 1977 kii duusari azaadi or jaiprakash kii sampurna kranti haadase kii shikaar ho gai or indira gandhi phir satta main lautin
 Those who announced the defeat of Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 were forced to apologize and the BJP was reduced to two seats
 2004 main atal-adwani kii mahakay lagati jodi ko haraa kar sonia gandhi kii congress ne vaapasi kar lee
 After all, what is this Sanjeevani that gives the Congress a second straight district? Is this the virtue earned by the freedom struggle which is still working? This may have seemed right 30 years ago, but now that generation has gone, who have seen the fight for independence or heard their stories from their elders
 ab to jo peedi he, vah kitaaben nahin, watsap messej padhati he or inamen se zyaadaatar messej azaadi kii viraasat or jazbe ko, uske netaaon ko, gandhi-nehru ko kaarij karne vaale hote hai
 Actually in response to this question one needs to look at Yogendra Yadav's tweet again
 ve congress kaa khaatmaa kyon chaahate hai? unka kahana he, agar congress bharat ke vichaar ko sangrakshit nahin rakh paati to uske bache rahane kaa matlab nahin he
 That is, it is the concern of the idea of india, not the Congress, because of which they make such a statement
 yah bharat kaa vichaar- yah idia of india- kya he? yah vichaar ek bahultavaadi-bahusaanskrithik-bahudharmik-bahubhashik bharat kaa vichaar he
 In this view, one religious system, one language, one culture does not consider other religions, other languages and cultures as second-class on the basis of their majority, but believes that the idea of the name Bharat is a combination of everyone, Thrives on equality and partnership
 yah vichaar achaanak kisi raat nahin upja he
 This idea has not been adopted like any principle in the book called Constitution
 yah vichaar bharat ke paanch hazaar saal ke itihaas kii aantarik muthbhed or gatyaatmakataa ke bich viksit hua he
 There are many beliefs in this, competing with each other, colliding with each other and strengthening each other many times - Sanatan tradition has faiths like Vaishnav, Shaivite, Shakta and Buddhism and Jainism too, later came Islam, Parsis and Christians are also part of this tradition
 bharat kaa islam vahi nahin he jo arab kaa islam he
 It is a flower grown in the typical Indian weather, which has got air-water-manure-soil here
 bharat ke janajaatiy ilaaqon main rah rahe isaayiyon ko dekh len to unamem or janajaatiy samoohon main koi antar miltaa hi nahin
 Of course, in the way of this cultural plurality, there were also various kinds of social radicals
 asprishyata ke alaava hindu-muslim pratispardhaa bhi bhartiya samaaj kii ek samasya rahi
 But there were people fighting this problem, making fun of it
 ye log na hote to kabir ko koun bachaata, koun yaad rakhata? amir khusro bharat kii sangithik-shastreey parampara kaa avichhinn hissaa kaise ban pate?azaadi kii ladaai ke daur main lekin bharat ne is bahultavaadi parampara ke bich apana ek maanas banaaya
 The hymns that Mahatma Gandhi chose for his prayer meetings were all chosen from the medieval poets here - he did not fall under the fascination and terror of the Vedas
 unhen maaloom tha ki bharat kii aatma kahaan basati he
 Once he was arrested in 1933, the magistrate asked who he was
 gandhi ne khud ko na swadhinata kaa sipaahi bataaya na sant bataaya, unhone kaha ki ve bunakar hai- julahe
 In one stroke, he connected himself and his fight with the tradition of Kabir
 darasal yahi bharat kaa vichaar he- idia of india- jise azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan sabase achche se mahasoos kiya gaya or jiske aadhaar par samvidhan banaaya gaya
 This constitution was also creating a new India in the sense that it was suggesting a way to move forward by leaving behind the fanatics, inequities, injustices of the old era
 azaadi ke baad congress is bharat kii pratinidhi bani rahi
 She kept on mixing different opinions, ideas, different languages and regions
 jab congress yah takat kho baithi to ek taraf rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or duusari taraf saamaajik nyaay kii takaton kaa udai hua
 Today we are finding that this idea of india is in danger
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or uske anushanbee sanghathan jis ikhare bharat kaa sapana paalate rahe, 2014 ke baad se us par amal kaa kaam jari he
 a very aggressive kind of majoritarianism is asserting its sole claim over the whole of India and showing various kinds of fears about other communities
 congress kaa kaam is bahusankhyakwaad se bhi ladanaa he
 If he cannot fight, then he should withdraw and hand over the command to those forces who can fight this battle, do politics of ideology related to it
 bharat main gandhi-lohia ke samaajwaad or ambedkar ke dalitwaad kii saajhedaari shaayad us sapane kii ore badhane kaa ek rasta bana sakati he
 There is no doubt that despite its political progress, the Congress continued to represent liberal majoritarianism for a long time in its social character
 isaki vajah se bhi bijepi kaa rasta aasaan hua
 But there is no doubt that sonia-rahul's Congress is different from indira-rajiv's Congress in its character
 kai arthon main vah pragatisheel bhi he or loktantric samaveshikta main bharosa rakhane vaali bhi
 This is the reason why his quarrel with the left-wing parties like the SP-BSP or the left parties like the CPM-CPI is not as sharp
 ulte kai jagah donon lagbhag saath chalate dikhaai padate hai
 Needless to say that if the Congress has to survive, then it will have to be avoided in this form and in the politics of alternative, it will have to keep itself behind
 congress ke khatme kaa matlab varchasv kii uski laalasaa ke khatme se he
 By the way, those announcing the end of the Congress should look at history and understand that the Congress is not a political party, but a social trend towards which this country is forced to return again and again
 supreme court ne tiger rigerv ke kor aria main paryaton par pabandi ko philhal kaayam rakhaa he
 In this case, the Supreme Court today asked the Central Government why it is now demanding the lifting of the ban, whereas earlier it had asked to ban the core area
 centre ne supreme court ke us aadesh ke khilaaf apil kii thi, jisamen tiger rigerv ke kor aria main paryaton par pabandi lagaai gai he
 The court said that when the number of tigers in the country has decreased so much, why do you worry so much about commercial work? The next hearing in this matter will be held on August 29 in the Supreme Court

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne shuukravaar ko press conference kar rafel vimaan saude ke mudde par modi sarkaar ko gheraa
 During this time, Rahul Gandhi also clarified on the meeting with Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar and said that he did not talk about Rafale plane deal in that meeting
 haalanki, unhone ye bhi kaha ki manohar parrikar se mulaakaat kaa ye matlab nahin ki main rafel vimaan saude kaa mudda nahin uthaaungaa
 Rahul Gandhi responded to this at Friday's press conference
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki main manohar parrikar se mila tha, lekin us mulaakaat main rafel vimaan saude par koi baat nahin hui thi
 He said that in the letter i wrote to him later, he said that meeting you does not mean that i will not ask Narendra Modi questions on the Rafale issue

 Parrikar wrote that you came to meet me for your political benefit
 mere saath bitaye 5 minuton main na to aapane rafel kaa zikr kiya or naa hi usase sambandhit kisi anya bare main charchaa kii
 However, in response to this, Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter saying that i know you are under political pressure, so you are giving the answer

 MNS chief Raj Thackeray has said that his party will not agitate on the Shah Rukh Khan case
 raaj thakare ne kaha ki ab tak unhone shahrukh ke khilaaf koi tippanee nahin kii he
 He said that if Shah Rukh wanted to bring Pakistani players into the team, he should have done so
 unhone spasht kiya ki unhen shahrukh khan ke prati koi vishesh prem nahin he
 Raj Thackeray also targeted the Shiv Sena, asking why this party only demanded an apology from Shah Rukh, not to Amitabh? It may be noted that King Khan had earlier said that Pakistan players should also be in the auction of players for IPL
 Should have been taken

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has received the seventh clean chit from the Election Commission
 gujarat ke patan main 21 april ko die bhaashan par vipaksh ko aapatti thi
 On the report of the District Election Officer and the Chief Electoral Officer of the state, the Commission did not see any flaw in this speech of Prime Minister Modi
 vipakshi dal congress ne ab tak piem modi or amit shah ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ulanghan kii 11 shikaayatein darj karai thim
 If the Commission kept ignoring him, the Congress requested the Supreme Court that Hazur, you should do something
 ayog to sunata hi nahin
 After this, the court rebuked the Commission as to why the Commission was not exercising its powers
 The court asked to settle all complaints of violation of the code of conduct lodged against modi-shah by Monday
 iske baad ayog ne shikayaton par apni kundali dhili kii or danaadan farmaan aane lage
 Clean chit in everything! In the last seven complaints, the report was sent by the local election administration, despite the evidence of opposition complaints and video recordings of speeches, the Commission did not find any merit
 ayog ke sabhabhavan se khabaren chhan chhan kar aane lageen ki sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 The situation seems to be repeating the times of some former Chief Election Commissioners Gopalaswami and Naveen Chawla
 jab donon ke bich matbhed or manabhed yahaan tak gaharaa gaye the ki gopalswami ko sarkaar se sifarish kerani padi ki chawla ko siisi na banaaya jaae, lekin upie sarkaar ne unki ek nahin suni
 Now, even going so far, one of the current three commissioners has never met yes to give a clean chit to PM Modi and Amit Shah
 unke alag rukh ke baavjood do ek ke bahumat se ye aadesh aae hai
 An Inside Story of a Clean Chit The story behind the clean chit that was received by the Election Commission to Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah is slowly unfolding
 ayog ke galiyaaron main dabi jabaan se ye charchaa garam he ki clin chit puri tarah clin nahin he
 It has spots of disagreement of a commissioner
 ayog ke sutara to ek ayukta kaa naam le rahe hai
 But no one is ready to openly name
 modi-shah ko ab tak ayog se jitani clin chit di gai he, un par ek hi ayukta ne sawaal uthaae
 The Commissioner who raised the objection said that there should be no question of clean chit when the same thing is being said from the District Election Officer to the CEO of the states and the evidence sent is also confirming the same
 lekin do ayuktaon ke bahumat se faisla ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, the facts and arguments of the commissioner are buried in the sandwich
 ek adhikari ne to yahaan tak kaha ki clin chit vaale aadesh ab tak media ke saamne ayog ke letterhed par bhi nahin aae hai
 Now constitutional experts and political analysts are also saying that to increase transparency, like the Supreme Court, issues of unanimous or different views should be disclosed in the Election Commission

 After 18 months, the sign of Rahu and Ketu is changing today
 ab rahu 17 agast yani aaj rahu kark main va ketu makar raashi main pravesh karenge
 On the other hand, the Sun God is also changing the zodiac
 suryadev kark raashi se singh raashi main aaj pravesh kar rahe hai
 This change will take place at 1:01 minutes night
 bhado maah main jab suryadev apni raashi parivartan karte hai to us sankranti ko singh sankranti kehete hai
 According to Pandit Vinod Mishra, Singh Sankranti Punyakal Thursday date 17
 08
 It will be from 05:55 in the morning to 12:24 on the 17th
 is din ghi kaa prayog aavashyak rup se kiya jaataa he, isi kaaran singh sankranti ko ghi sankranti kaha jaataa he
 In Ayurveda it is described under Charaka Samhita that pure cow (gau Ghrit) means that Desi ghee enhances memory, intelligence, energy, balvirya, ooze, cow's ghee is fat and destroys vata, bile, fever and toxins
 
 manyata ke anusaar is din jo gaay kaa ghi nahin khaataa use agle janm main ganel yani ghonghe ke rup main janm lenaa padataa he
 On the other hand, the relocation of Orahu and Ketu will affect life
 pandit vinod mishra ke anusaar rahu va ketu purv jivan ke karmon ke anusaar fal dete hai
 To avoid the ill effects of rahu-ketu, one gets relief by staying sattvic on Saturday and offering red flowers and sweets to Hanuman ji

 Akhilesh government fulfilled the big election promises like unemployment allowance, Kanya Vidya Dhan, loan waiver of farmers, free laptop distribution
 haalanki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii belgaum gundgardee or lagaataar bigadati kanoon-vyavastha ne akhilesh sarkaar par prashnchihn bhi lagaae hai
 The Samajwadi Party came to power in Uttar Pradesh on the slogan of secularism
 usee ke shasankaal main soobe main ek saal main sampradayik hinsa kii 25 ghatnaayen huin
 Took command of Uttar Pradesh on 15 March 2012 as a carrier of change
 vilaayat se padhe-likhe noujvaan mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se janata ko dheron ummiden thim, lekin vidhansabha chunaavon main purna bahumat ke saath satta main aane vaali sapa ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon kaa huddang akhilesh ke shapath grahan ke din hi najar aa gaya
 It was clear on the very first day that the biggest challenge before Akhilesh would be to change his image of the party promoting Gundaraj
 parantu, beete ek saal ke dauraan hue ghatnakram to yahi kehete hai ki pradesh main gundaraj kii vaapasi adhik pukhta hui he
 This Gundaraja also defied all election promises of Akhilesh's much anticipated good governance
 pichley ek varsh main uttar pradesh do darjan se zyada sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon kaa gavaah bana
 About 15 people died and around a hundred people were injured in these incidents
 bazaar band rahe or aam logon ko jabardast nuksaan hua
 Akhilesh did not live up to expectations: bjp's state spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak says that during the assembly elections, Akhilesh had done a good job by not including Bahubali DP Yadav and Mukhtar Ansari to the Samajwadi Party
 janata ko laga ki akhilesh samaajawaadee party kii paramparaagat 'gunda chhavi' ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 People understood that by becoming his Chief Minister, the winds of change would flow in the state, but all hopes were broken within a year
 pathak ne kaha ki kanoon vyavastha or apni party ke kaaryakartaaon kii gundgardee par lagaam lagane main akhilesh puri tarah se naakaam sabit rahe hai
 Akhilesh blamed the media, while Akhilesh blamed the hand of opposition parties behind the incidents of communal violence and said that those who have been arrested in these incidents of violence
 unke bare main pataa kiya jaae ki wo kis raajnneetik dal ke log hai
 Refusing to consider law and order as bad, Akhilesh blamed the media on Wednesday
 akhilesh ne kaha ki kanoon-vyavastha ke mudde ko media ne zyada badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya he
 Akhilesh, however, provided unemployment allowance, Kanya Vidya Dhan, free irrigation, 108 abulance service under Samajwadi Health Service, waiving farmers loans up to fifty thousand rupees, women's power line service, restoring student union, lucknow-agra He also did many commendable works like approving expressway construction, decision to start metro rail in Lucknow
 mulaayam khud bhi khush nahinsau din puure hone ke maukey par akhilesh sarkaar ko sau main se sau nambar dene vaale samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav bhi sarkaar ke pradarshan par sawaal uthaakar pichley dinon ye kah chuke hai ki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se logon ke andar jo feel good hona chahie, wo nahin ho rahaa he
 On the last few occasions, publicly, ministers, legislators and leaders have expressed their displeasure over the conduct and have threatened to immediately warn and improve the conduct, but it did not seem to have any effect
 
 
 
 Things can improve: According to former Inspector General of Police, Uttar Pradesh Inspector General of Police SR Darapuri, in many incidents of politicians' felony, the Akhilesh government, instead of taking action against its leaders, slashed the officers on the contrary, due to which their morale was further boosted
 Gone
 jarurat he ki afasaron ko protsaahit karke gundagardee karne vaale netaaon par kadi karwai karke ek kadaa sandesh dene kii, tabhi halaat sudharenge
 In order to save power on credit, some decisions such as orders to stop power supply to commercial establishments after seven o'clock in the evening and approval of mlas to buy vehicles up to Rs
 20 lakh for their personal use from development fund, are back within 12 hours
 The taking had a rebuke on Akhilesh Yadav's image
 raajnneetik or naukarshahi donon hi str par bahut se shakti centre hone ke aaropon se logon main yah sanket gaya he ki mukhyamantri kaa sarkaar par purna niyantran nahin he
 The BSP told Akhilesh that helpless, helpless, weak leader of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Leader of Opposition in Uttar Pradesh Swami Prasad Maurya says that Akhilesh Yadav is seen as helpless, helpless and weak Chief Minister
 unke raaj main lagata hi nahin he ki uttar pradesh main sarkaar naam kii koi cheez he
 He said that Akhilesh government could not spend half of the previous budget
 ye sarkaar kii ek badi naakaami ko darshata he
 It can be said that this government has failed on every front
 tarif laayak koi kaam nahin kiya: congrescongress kii varisht netaa reeta bahuguna joshi kahati hai ki mukhyamantri akhilesh ne ek saal main koi aisa kaam nahin kiya, jisase unki tarif kii jaae
 With the exception of some lollipops such as laptops and unemployment allowances, no concrete steps were taken by the state government for development
 'apano' ne thapthapai peethudhar, samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa ram gopal yadav vipakshi dalon ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kehete hai ki mukhyamantri ke taur par akhilesh yadav ne uttar pradesh main jis tarah vikaas ko gati di he, vah saraahneey he

 ) Pakistani cricket and controversies have always been related
 bada toornament aayaa nahin ki nae-nae vivaad saamne aane lagate hai
 The latest controversy is about the captaincy of Shahid Afridi, in which PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has said in a statement to the British website that he should be removed after the World Cup
 shehryaar ne kaha ki 'pakistani team world tii-20 main chaahe jaisaa bhi pradarshan kare, lekin iske baad afridi ko captaini se hataa diya jayega
 ' badi baat yah ki is tarah kaa bayaan tab aayaa he jab team ko bharat se mili haar ke baad prerana kii zarurat he
 Earlier too, Shaharyar had given a statement after the Asia Cup that 'afridi was made the captain in the same condition as he had spoken about retiring after World T20
 ' Not only this, the talk of falling on the team's head coach Waqar Younis is also coming and there is talk of changing the selectors and management as well
 mukhya chayankarta haaron rashid par manamaani karne ke aarope hai, isliye unhen bhi hataaya ja saktaa he
 The board is also angry at the Pakistani team's selection against India, as it believes a spinner should have been included in place of the fourth pacer
 tippaniyan There are reports of infighting in the team and it seems that Waqar and Afridi are unable to handle the team
 yahi vajah he ki umr akmal ne imran khan se khud ko top order main laae jane kii sifaarish karwaai, lekin is par purv pakistani captain rameez raja ne pakistani tivi channel jeeyo news ko die bayaan main kaha he ki akmal ko agle match ke liye baahar bitha dena chahie

 Everyone here is taking the government in the dock with the deteriorating communal atmosphere
 id to puri duniya main manaai gai, lekin ballabhagarh ke paas khandavalee gaanv main is baar id kuch alag thi
 Most people read the Eid prayers with a black band and did not celebrate Eid
 yah virodh pradarshan guuruuvaar ko ek local train main junayd kii hatya ko lekar kiya gaya
 People say that they want justice and the government should take strict action on such matters
 junayd ke ghar kaali pattee baandhakar aae aasapaas ke gaanvon ke logon kaa aana-janaa laga rahaa
 On the occasion of Eid everyone appeared in their sorrow
 gharavaale insaaf kii maang kar rahe hai
 Junaid's father Jalaluddin says, "now my son is gone, but the government should fix the deteriorating environment in the country so that no other Junaid's death is killed
" '' According to Junaid's mother, Shayra, after the body of Junaid arrived in the house, it was found that her son had been killed
 syra junayd ko yaad karte hue kahati hai ki ''junayd aksar kaha karata tha ki vah ek din dilli kii jama maszid kaa imam banegaa
 But my son was beaten to death
 kya galati thi us maasoom kii?'' Junaid was killed by a mob beaten and stabbed at Asavati near Ballabhgarh

 Eid was celebrated all over the world, but this time in Khandavali village near Ballabhgarh, Eid was different
 zyaadaatar logon ne id kii namaaj kaali pattee baandhakar padhi or id nahin manaai
 The protest was held on Thursday over the killing of Junaid in a local train
 logon kaa kahana he ki unhen insaaf chahie or sarkaar ko aise maamalon ko lekar sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 People from the surrounding villages who came wearing black belt to Junaid's house started coming and going
 id ke maukey par har koi unke gam main shariq dikhaa
 The family members are demanding justice
 junayd ke pita jilaluddin kaa kahana he ki ''ab meraa bete to chalaa gaya lekin sarkaar ab desh main bigadate maahaul ko thik kare jisase phir koi or junayd kii maut na maaraa jaae
 '' junayd kii maa shaayara ke mutabik ghar main junayd kaa shav aane ke baad pataa chalaa ki unke bete ko maaraa gaya he
 Saira recalls Junaid saying that "junaid often used to say that he would one day become the Imam of Jama Masjid of Delhi
" lekin mere bete ko peet petakar maar daalaa gaya
 What was the fault of that innocent person? '' junayd kii ballabhagarh ke paas asavati main bheed ne petakar or chaaku markar hatya kar di
 According to eyewitnesses, communal remarks were also made during the quarrel
 police ab tak ek hi aaropee ko pakad saki he
 a reward of one lakh has been kept on giving clues to the remaining accused
 log is ghatana ko lekar sarkaar ke rukh se behad naaraaz hai
 People from the surrounding area said that nowadays there is fear of wearing a hat, walking with a beard
 ek or shaks ne kaha ki junayd kii maut samaaj main fail rahi nafrat kaa nateeja he
 Today the Muslim community is frightened
 tippaniyan Vimal Bhai, the national coordinator of the mass movement, also visited the victim's family
 unhone kaha ki hindu bhi isi desh kaa he or muslim bhi isi desh kaa he
 Who are people to call them Pakistanis? kya aap gaay ke naam par insaanon kaa katl karoge
 All of this is a game run by the Emperor, Narendra Modi
 aakhir sarkaar kyon khamosh he

 apni rachana 'mal main kabutar' main badi-badi attalikaon ke rup main khadey maalon par kataaksh karte hue vinay likhte hai, Gone are those days jab shor ke uthne se Where was the market gaye ve din When the smell showed ki kahaan kya bik rahaa he Gone are those days jab afratfari se pataa chalata tha How hot is the market bazaarvaadi samskruti kis tarah logon or prakruti ke aadim sambandhon ko nasht kar rahaa he, ise vinay ne bakhubi pahachaanaa he or likhaa he- This system of things has not settled like this main khud hi ujaad gaya hum karne main intjaam Maintenance of things more than the closed ones sahab hon yaa ki bivi chizon ke sab gulam
 Vinay poses very serious issues in his creation in very simple and simple language, finally, considering the victims of consumerist culture as a pigeon, who is unknowingly trapped in a global vicious cycle of malls
 mal kii samskruti ke nihitartho or maanviya samvednaa ke badalte ayaamon ko chihnti karne main ye kavitaayen sahaj maaloom padati hai

 ) In his composition 'pigeon in the Mall', Vinay writes while sarcasm on the malls standing as big atticals, gaye ve din When noises arise pataa chalata tha bazaar kidar he Gone are those days jab mahak se pataa chalata tha Where are you selling gaye ve din When the chaos showed ki bazaar kitna garm he How the marketist culture is destroying the primitive relations of people and nature, Vinay has recognized it well and wrote- yun hi nahin basaa he chizon kaa ye nizaam i am devastated by myself bandon se kahin zyada chizon kaa rakh-rakhaav Sir or all the slaves of wife things
 vinay apni rachana main behad gambhir muddon ko behad sahaj va saral bhashaa main saamne rakhte hai, ant main, upabhoktavaadi samskruti ke shikaar logon par us kabutar ke rup main gaur karte hai, jo anjaane main mal rupi vaishvik kuchakr main funs jaataa he
 These poems seem easy to identify the implications of the mall's culture and the changing dimensions of human sensation

 1200 mobile in hand, slim body but amazing confidence and comfort on face
 ye hai 20veen sadi main azamgarh ke nizamabad se teen baar ke vidhayak alam badi
 When the 'aaj Tak' team reached the house of Alam Badi Saheb, sweeping the streets of Mileshahar sweeping the house, it was a surprise that it is the home of three-time MLA and again Samajwadi Party candidate Alam Badi
 badi sahab subah uthakar apane kamare kii khud saafe safai karke hamase milane aaye, kamare kii jhaadu lagane ke vijual lene se manaa kar diya, bole ye to meraa vyaktigat kaam he, sabhi apane ghar main karte hai, isko kya dikhaanaa
 There is no party flag or horn at his house during the election season
 haa, bharat kaa jhanda jarur laga he
 Even the initiative is not seen as an election, it is a bundle of simplicity
 aam taur par badi sahab ke ghar aane vaale ko chote se cap main bina doodh kii chaay milti he
 There is also no servant in the house to cook and serve breakfast for the guests
 unke bete or pote hi is kaam ko karte hai

 Safarbadi saheb does not have a proper car in UP Roadways
 pehle second hand ambesder thi, to puure ilaake main jaani jaati thi, kyonki kai baar bich sadak par khadi ho jaati thi, kabhi tel khatm, to kabhi bighad bhi jaaya karti thi
 Now barely a second hand bolero is taken, but rarely use it
 aakhir tel dalane kaa masalaa aa jaataa he
 In such a situation, Badi Sahib sometimes sits in a worker's car or takes a lift from what he found on the road
 vidhansabha satr ke dauraan lakhanu jane ke liye wo upi roadways kii bas main apane paas kaa istemaal kar lete hai
 Badi Saheb is a mechanical engineer, initially also worked in Gorakhpur, but came to social service after drawing inspiration from Nehru, Bose, Gandhi

 Since then, he has won elections 3 times, fighting for the 5th time
 sirf ek baar thode se voton se haar gaye the
 The special thing about the election campaign of Alam Badi fought in two lakhs is that they campaign only from 9 am to 5 pm
 unka kahana he ki jab wo puure 5 saal 9 se 5 janata kii seva karata hoon, to chunaav ke dauraan vakt ko kyon badla jaae
 It is interesting that once Badi Saheb lost the election, the next morning also reached the people in the area at 9 o'clock
 vaise aapako jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki, badi sahab ne 2012 kaa chunaav mahaj 2 lakh rupay main hi ladaa tha
 This time they say that, so far only 2 lakh has been spent in the election, if a few more days, maybe a few thousand more will be spent
 badi sahab ke is rukh se kai baar unke gharavaale naakhush rahete hai
 Their pain spills over in a mutual conversation

 The second son has a small furniture shop, from which the bus passes away
 aajkal chunaav ke mausam main wo dukaan band kar pita ke saath prachaar main jute hai
 The younger son lives with Alam Badi as a PA, but it is clear that he can do any order or work without Badi Saheb
 unka kaam sirf badi sahab kaa aadesh maanane kaa hota he, wo sirf phone milaate hai, baat khud badi hi karte hai
 Alam Badi says 'neither do i eat commissions nor do my sons play games with the contractor'
 ilaake main mashhoor he ki, badi sahab kii vidhayak nidhi kaa tender jaldi koi thekedaar nahin letaa, kyonki wo sadak, naala, yaa koi bhi kaam khud khadey hokar karaate hai
 Do not charge commission and also do not miss blacklisting the contractor in case of shortage
 shaheedon ke naam par smaarkalam badi ke bare main unki eemaandaaree ke saath hi sabhi dharm or jatiyon ke liye barabarkam karne ke kisse bhi hai
 Recently, Badi Saheb has built 4 big gates in the name of the martyrs of this area, in which no Muslim is there
 dwaar dikhaate vaqt badi sahab bade fakr se bataate hai ki, isse aane vaali peedi ko prerana milegi
 Badi Sahab was asked by Mulayam Singh Yadav and then Akhilesh Yadav to become a minister, and Badi refused
 wo kehete hai ki, main aaj tak tikat yaa nishaan maangane nahin gaya, netaji or akhilesh khud hi bhej dete hai
 When he asked to become a minister, i suggested to make a young man
 badi kehete hai ki wo mantri ban jate to apane ilaake se dur ho jate
 The harsh suggestions given to Mulayam, such a suggestion has been given to Mulayam Singh, which left Mulayam himself as well
 badi bataate hai ki mulaayam singh ne unase kaha ki kuch aisa kaam bataao jisase log mujhe yaad rakhen
 On which Badi suggested to Mulayam that after winning the election, make sure that your MLA and Minister will live in the house where they lived before winning the election
 bangala or kothi nahin lenge, laal batti bhi naa lagaaein, to janata aapako kabhi nahin bhuulegi
 Badi says that after listening to my suggestion, Mulayam said that i will do it, but nowadays everyone becomes an MLA for this, how will they believe
 vaise akhilesh ko lekar badi khulkar kehete hai ki, wo munh main chaandi kii chammach lekar paidaa hue hai, lekin unke sanskaar aise hai ki wo aage jaayenge
 When i leave, they stand up from the chair
 aakhir main hamane badi sahab se izaazat lee, to poocha ki aap is umr main itane feet kaise rah pate hai
 He replied with a sarcasm, 'I eat both veg, non-veg, but there is a dose of 2 roti, 2 eggs and 2 glasses of milk throughout the day

 The theme of the second session of the Karnataka chapter of the India Today State of State Conclave was Agriculture and Development First
 is seshan main karnataka ke krishi mantri krishna gauda, agriculture secretary ashok dalwai or orgainik farming karne vaale madhu chandan ne hissaa liya
 The session was moderated by India Today Research Editor Ajit Jha
 is satr kii shuruyaat kisaanon kii aamadani ko 2022 tak doguni karne ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai ke mudde se hui
 The state agriculture minister believed that the situation in agriculture has changed today
 kisaanon ko adhik upjau beej nahin apni fasal ke liye adhik keemat chahie
 At the same time, Ashok Dalwai said that to increase the income of farmers - instead of production, income needs to be preferred
 kaltivation ke saste sansadhano ko jutaney kii jarurat he
 This work can be done with the help of technology
 iske logon kaa shahari ilaakon se ek baar phir gramin ilaakon kii taraf hoga
 After increasing the agricultural production in the state, it should now be tried in the state how to reduce the yield to the minimum area
 iskaa phayda hoga ki bache hue kheton main kisaan ko anya cash crop lagane kaa mauka milegaa jisase aasaani se uski vaarshik aamadani bad sakati he
 According to Ashol Dalwai, we can increase the income of farmers by production matrix or crop geometry
 iske saath hi agriculture ko industry kaa bakabon banane main bhi madad milegi
 Once there is a possibility for cash crop, farmers will need to give priority to those crops which are in direct demand in the industry
 iskaa sabase bada phayda hoga ki ek baar phir desh main rojgaar kaa sabase bada saadhan krishi kshetra main paidaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Also read: Birthday Special: Manmohan's' Warning ', which gradually proved to be true, Ajit Jha, who is conducting the session, asked whether farmers' income can be doubled even through 100% irrigation? In response, Madhu Chandan says that we cannot deny the fact that India is short of water
 or aane vaale dinon main pani kii kami or sankeern ho jaaegi
 According to the data, 80 percent of the total water resources in the country are being used in agriculture
 vahiin desh puri tarah se barish par nirbhar hai
 Therefore, in such rain fed areas of the country, we need to invest in those crops which can be grown in minimum water
 iske liye yah bhi jaruri he ki ham israaese se sabak len
 Israel noted new irrigation resources as well as high yielding seeds through RND
 iske chalate aaj israe pani kii kami or krishi upyog main aane vaali jameen kii kami ke baavjood kheton se production ko badha liya he
 Finally Ajit Jha said that when California has made 40 percent of its desert with the help of Silicon City, why India has failed to do so
 yaa jo kaam rajasthan main sriganganagar ne kiya, vah kaam uttar karnataka yaa desh ke anya rajyon main kyon nahin kiya ja sakaa
 It was emphasized at the end of this session that without ensuring the prosperity of the farmers, no state can live longer in the role of a leader with the help of Silicon Valley
