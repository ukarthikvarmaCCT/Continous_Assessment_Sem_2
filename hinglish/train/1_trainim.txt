 ' mahashivaratri ke din ham bhagwaan bhole kii to puja karte hi hai, lekin aapane kabhi sochaa he ki bhagwaan shiv ke saath hameshaa gana bhi rahete hai
 After all, who is this gana? What is their importance? Let us answer and understand these questions of yours today and understand the Maya of Lord Ganesha - Lord Shiva's Ganas have been described in many different ways
 koi unhen shiv kaa mitra bataata he to koi unka rakshak
 Actually, Gan is a friend of Mahadev and also a protector
 ve unke sakha bhi he or saathi bhi
 Among the Puranas, Shiva is the major gana - Bhairava, Veerabhadra, Manibhadra, Chandis, Nandi, Jai, Vijay and etc
 aisi manyata he ki ye gana manushya se alag the or kisi duusari duniya se aae the
 They did not have bones in their body and the shape was odd
 ye gana bhashaa bhi insaanon jaisi nahin bolte the or bas shor karte the
 Due to this, all people called him eccentric, but it was only Bholenath who understood his noise and considered him friendly
 aisi manyata he ki shiv 15000 saal pehle maansarovar aae the
 Mansarovar is known as a relic of the Tethys sea and is believed to have originated at that time
 vartmaan main wo samudr ab ek jhil main badal chukaa he
 Gajapati or Ganapati? Have you ever wondered why we call Lord Ganesha as Ganapati and why not Gajapati? We are all aware that Ganesha was beheaded by elephants
 bataa den, ek baar jab mata parvati snaan kar raheen thim tab unhone ganesh ko bolaa tha ki ve kisi ko bhi kaksh ke bheetar naa aane de
 Ganesha obeyed his orders and did not let anyone in
 lekin tabhi mahadev mata parvati se milane aae
 But the child Ganesh also stopped them from coming because they were not aware that he was their father
 is baat se krodhit hokar bhagwaan shiv ne ganesh kaa sar dhar se alag kar diya
 Later, when Mahadev realized his mistake, he put an elephant's head on him
 ye to hui katha kii baat, lekin sawaal ye hai ki ham ganesh ko ganpati kyon kehete hai or gajpati kyon nahin
 By the way, if Ganesha was given an elephant's head, we should call him Gajapati, but we address him as Ganapati
 aisa isliye he kyonki bhagwaan shiv ne jis hathi kaa sar ganesh ko lagaaya tha wo swayan ek gana tha
 Yes, Bholenath had removed one of his heads and applied it to Ganesh
 isliye ham unhen ganpati kehete hai gajpati nahin
 By the way, tell us that vampires, demons, demons, and ghosts are also Ganesha of Bholenath and are always near him

 kamaal kii kalpana shakti ke dhani subodh apane nijee itihaas or rosemara ke upyog vaali chizon ko kaam main lekar unhen saamaajik badlaav ke pratik ke rup main tabdeel kar dete hai

 Their huge installations made from Indian utensils create a magical effect in the audience
 ve bharat main kareeb 30 karod ke madhyavarg kii teji se badhati aakankshaon ke pratik bhi lagate hai
 The India that Subodh represents first seeks to embody all its chaotic contradictions and surprising intricacies into its personality and art, and then adjust it to other / developed / contemporary worlds

 congress ne aaj apana 130waan sthapana diwas manaaya
 On this occasion, Congress President Sonia Gandhi hoisted the party flag at the party headquarters in New Delhi
 lekin is mauqe par congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi maujuud nahin the
 No explanation was given from the Congress party about the reason for Rahul's absence
 yahaan tak ki is sambandh enditivi kii taraf se sampark kiye jane ke baavjood rahul gandhi ke offis kii ore se koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 Trust the discussion, Rahul is 'out'
 rahul gandhi ko puraa haq he ki kabhi bhi ghar se baahar rah sakate hai, dilli se baahar rah sakate hai yaa phir desh se baahar bhi ja sakate hai
 Every right to live outside them as a person should be respected and supported
 lekin sawaal tab uth khadey hote hai, jab ek netaa ke taur par vah party kii sthapana diwas ke mauqe par samaaroh se baahar rahen
 There can be two reasons for staying out
 vyaktigat yaa partigat
 If he were out for party reasons, there must have been some information about this towards the party or his office, as it has come before
 lekin aisi kisi soochna ke abhaav main ham ye maanane ko swatantra hai ki unka baahar hona party ke kisi kaarykram main shaamil hone, kisi party dailygation ko lekar kahin jane yaa aisi kisi duusari gatividhi se judaa nahin he
 Second reason
 unka baahar janaa kisi nijee kaarykram main shaamil hone se lekar nae saal ke jashn main shariq hone se bhi judaa ho saktaa he
 There can be some very personal reason, on which we have no right to speak
 lekin dhyaan rahe ki ve ek vyakti ke saath-saath or congress upaadhyaksh ke taur par saarvajanik jindagi bhi jite hai
 The general public of the country does not matter where he lives on the occasion of Congress's foundation day, but the workers of his party definitely make a difference
 do din pehle hi party mahasachiv digvijay singh ne madhya pradesh main ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki rahul gandhi ko party kaa 'phul tim' netritv karnaa chahie
 Perhaps he meant to say that the party should be given full time
 rahul puraa vakt de rahe hai or dete bhi honge
 They may not always want to appear in the media while doing so
 zaruri gopneeyata baratna bhi zaruri hota he
 But when the occasion is of Foundation Day, it is necessary to be seen giving full time to the party among its leaders and workers
 yah sahi he ki sonia gandhi hi abhi tak party kii tamaam badi zimmedaari uthaa raheen hai
 Is taking every major decision
 haar se niraash party ko nai disha or dasha dene kii koshish kar rahi hai
 But the next reins are to take over Rahul, then his absence will not work on such important occasions
 rahul par pehle se hi raajnneeti ko lekar agambhir hone kii charchaa uthati rahi he
 But when the responsibility of raising the party again has to be taken up, now seriousness has to be seen
 party ke aise aayojanon main aana padegaa jo pratikatmak taur par hi sahi, netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke liye bahut myne rakhte hai
 Earlier, when Sonia Gandhi hosted a dinner in honor of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul was still missing
 shor machaa to jaankaree ai videsh main hai
 It was clarified on behalf of his office that he had already met Manmohan Singh for ten years, thanking him for taking over the reins of the country
 lekin vah jab bhi aabhaar jataa aae hon uski koi jaankaree media ko nahin di gai thi
 The reason for Rahul's absence is not known even today
 unke jivan kaal main sampatti ke naam par unke paas kya tha? viraasat ke naam kya, jis par aane vaali peediyaan apana daawa karatin? mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya kaa jivan desh or shiksha ko samarpit tha

 is saramaaya par kiski daavedaari hoti? yah to sabakaa tha
 He belonged to the whole country
 unhone aisa jivan bhi nahin jiya, jo sirf apane parivaar tak simit hota
 But today there is a dispute over generations over the claim on the legacy of his name
 parivaar main aapasi takaraar pehle bhi rahi hogi, lekin unhen bharat ratna die jane kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi yah sataha par aa gai
 The controversy was over who would receive this honor at the hands of the President
 92-year-old Saraswati Malviya, the eldest daughter-in-law of the family, staked her claim on Saquaman
 kuch hi dinon main yah vivaad raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii choukhat tak ja pahunchaa, jab saraswati malviya ne unhen patr likhakar unka dhyaan mahaamanaa ke vasietname kii ore dilaayaa
 He claimed that Mahamana Malaviya had declared his eldest son Ramakant Malaviya as his successor in a will written in 1942
 agle hi saal 1943 main ramakant kii asamyik mrityu ke baad nae vasietname main unke bete shridhar malviya ko uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya gaya
 Saraswati argued that she is the widow of the heir named in the will and therefore she has the right to receive the Maha Ratna's Bharat Ratna
 isi bich mahaamanaa kii pautri, shridhar kii bahan or parivaar kii sabase umradraj jivit sadsy 98 varshiya hem sharma ne apni bhabhi saraswati malviya ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya
 He said that Giridhar Malaviya, grandson of Mahamana Malaviya, is trying to take forward his concept alone
 isliye is sammaan ko grahan karne ke hakdaar ve hi hai
 When the dispute was not resolved for three months, the Union Home Ministry jointly summoned Hem Sharma, Giridhar Malviya, Premadhar Malviya and Saraswati Malviya to attend the honor ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan on 30 March
 kaan se kam sunai dene ke baavjood bharat ratna kii baat chhidate hi saraswati malviya kii ankhon main chamak aa jaati he
 She says, "the President gave the Bharat Ratna in my hand
 sab vahaan maujuud the
 Everyone saw that i was the only one
 un teenon ko nahin diya
 ʼʼ She does not stay here, "I said that Bharat Ratna should be brought to Allahabad first, where he was born
" lekin kuch aisa hua ki bharat ratna biechayu le jaaya gaya
 ʼʼ She targets Giridhar Malaviya in gestures
 nyaayadhish ke rup main saikadon mukademon ko sulajhaa chuke 78 varshiya giridhar malviya lagaataar is vivaad se duuri banaae hue hai
 "it was very unfortunate when the news of a dispute in the Malaviya family about receiving the Bharat Ratna came up in the newspapers," he says in a very natural way
 maine sarkaar se kaha tha ki sammaan jise bhi mili, lekin use rakhaa biechayu main hi jaae
 There are more than 30,000 students here
 yahaan ke kala bhawan main hi mahaamanaa ke jivan se judi sari chijen rakhi hui hai
 ʼʼbahana may have been Bharat Ratna, but at the root of this dispute of sudden rising claim is Allahabad's ancestral bungalow

 yah bangala saraswati ke shvasur or mahaamanaa ke sabase bade bete ramakant malviya ne 1930 main banwaaya tha
 Ramakant was a diwan in the then Nadwara state in Rajasthan
 is bangale par daavedaari kaa vivaad bhi nyaayalay kii choukhat laangh chukaa he
 Many members of the Ramakant Malaviya family have claimed their stake in the bungalow spread over two acres
 parivaar ke ek varisht sadsy kehete hai, ''saraswati ne mahaamanaa kaa bharat ratna sammaan grahan karne ke liye jo peshbandi kii, uski jad main is bangale se judaa vivaad hi he
 Through this, she wants to prove herself as the rightful heir of Mahamana family
 ʼʼ bangale ko lekar chal rahi khinchataan main saraswati kaaphi asahaj dikhaai detii hai
 She says, "some people are behind my house
 ve jaalsaji kar rahe hai
 We have requested ADM Nazul's office to get this house free hold
 ʼʼvaranasi ke makaan par vivadapariwaar main vivaad us vakt bhi uthaa tha, jab biechayu ke saamne lanka ilaake main mahaamanaa ke bete govind malviya kaa banwaaya gaya makaan bechaa gaya tha
 In 1995, when Giridhar Malviya started the process of selling the house built by his father due to lack of care, BHU students started the movement
 chaatro kaa aarope tha ki yah makaan swatantraaa sangram senaanee or varanasi ke udyogpati shivaprasad gupta ne mahaamanaa ko daan diya tha
 How can Girdhar Malaviya sell it? Girdhar Malaviya says, "mahamana had not accepted any object of charity for his whole life
 ye aarope niraadhaar the
 ʼʼ However there is no dispute over the properties Mahamana purchased for her family
 elahabaad jila mukhyalay se chah kimi dur dakshin main malviya nagar main vah purana makaan bhi he, jahaan unka janm hua tha
 Mahamana bought the temple of Lord Krishna here by buying it from his family
 ab is ghar main unke sabase bade bhai lakshminarayan malviya ke pautra anand or vivek apane parivaar ke saath rahete hai
 Mahamana bought two houses next to and in front of this house, which he handed over to the family of Ramakant and Gaurikant
 jorge toun main saraswati malviya ke bangale se sate gerue or safed rang vaale bangale main giradhar malviya rahete hai
 Before leaving the practice in 1911, Mahamana Malaviya had built this bungalow spread over three acres
 unhone iske do hisse kiye
 Gave one to Govind, where Girdhar Malaviya now lives
 doosraa hissaa radhakant malviya ko diya
 Later Radhakant divided the three parts of his house and divided it among his three sons Yashodhar, Chakradhar and Sudhadhar
 mahaamanaa ne apane sabase chote bete govind malviya ko hi apana nijee sachiv banaaya tha
 His only son Giridhar Malaviya is the only person who is engaged in cherishing the memories and legacy associated with Mahamana

 ) iskar vibhaag ne isse pehle bhi yah kadam uthaaya tha
 At that time also, the department had released a list of 67 such people who were owed heavy tax liability
 lekin tab aise logon kaa yaa to ata-pataa nahin chalaa yaa phir unke paas vasuuli ke liye koi sampatti hi nahin thi

 ) pakistan ke purv pradhanmantri nawaz shareef ne pehali baar mana he ki mumbai hamale main pakistani aatankwaadiyon kaa haath tha
 In an interview to Pakistani newspaper Don News, Sharif also questioned why the trial related to the attack was not being completed
 pakistan ke purv pradhanmantri nawaz shareef ne mumbai hamale main pakistani aatankwaadiyon ke shaamil hone kii baat qabooli he
 In an interview to Dawn News, Nawaz Sharif questioned the condition of Pakistan and said that "terrorist organizations are active
" chaahe unhen non state actor kahen lekin kya hamen unhen seemaa paar jaakar mumbai main 150 logon kii hatya karne dena chahie? ham trial puraa kyon nahin kar sakate?” It is important to note that Sharif's party still has government in Pakistan
 aise main sawaal ki kya shareef ke qaboolname ke baad bhi paak sarkaar kuch karegi? Reacting to Sharif's statement, Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir has said that we have always been saying what the former PM has now controlled
 ummid he ki vahaan ki maujuuda sarkaar aatankwaad rokane ke kargar qadam uthaaegi
 Hafiz Saeed is the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, India has presented all the evidence to Pakistan
 par use or uske saathiyon ko ab tak sazaa nahin mili he
 The comments is bayaan ke zarie shareef darasal pakistan kii sena par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Nawaz Sharif, who became Prime Minister for the third time in 2013, was not only removed from office in July 2017 on charges of corruption, but the Supreme Court has also banned him from contesting for life
 iske peeche kii vajah sena se unki dushmani ko mana ja rahaa he
 It is clear from the statement of Nawaz Sharif, who is trying to win his party in the elections this year, that the army runs, not the elected government in the country
 nawaz shareef ne beshak ab qaboola to par ye pehla mauqaa nahin he jab mumbai hamale main pakistani aatankiyon kaa haath qaboola gaya ho
 In 2009, Home Minister Rehman Malik of the then Pakistan People's Party government gave a full details of how the Mumbai attack was carried out from Pakistan's land after a one and a half hour press conference
 haalanki na to pipipi or na hi nawaz kii sarkaar ne doshiyon ko sazaa dilaayi he

 haalanki na to pipipi or na hi nawaz kii sarkaar ne doshiyon ko sazaa dilaayi he
 Through this statement, Sharif is actually questioning the Pakistan Army
 2013 main teesri baar pradhanmantri bane nawaz shareef ko bhrashtachar ke aarope main july 2017 main na sirf pad se hataa diya gaya balki supreme court ne unke aaajeevan chunaav ladane par bhi pabandi laga di he
 The reason behind this is believed to be his enmity with the army
 is saal chunaav main apni party ko jeet dilaane kii koshish main jute nawaz shareef ke bayaan se saafe he ki desh main chuni hui sarkaar kii nahin balki sena kii chalati he
 Nawaz Sharif, of course, has now quelled, but this is not the first time that the Pakistani terrorists have lost their hand in the Mumbai attack
 2009 main tatkaaleen pakistan pipuls party sarkaar ke grahamantri rahamaan malik ne dedh ghante kii press confrence kar puraa byoraa diya tha ki mumbai hamale ko kis tarah se pakistan kii zamin se anjaam diya gaya
 However neither the PPP nor Nawaz's government have punished the culprits
 nawaz shareef ne beshak ab qaboola to par ye pehla mauqaa nahin he jab mumbai hamale main pakistani aatankiyon kaa haath qaboola gaya ho
 In 2009, Home Minister Rehman Malik of the then Pakistan People's Party government gave a full details of how the Mumbai attack was carried out from Pakistan's land after a one and a half hour press conference

 He said that the Congress which imposed Emergency in the country is trying to discredit Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah by making false allegations
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi postmortem report, jaj report, police jaanch, supreme court ke faisle par yakeen nahin karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi simply trusts those who shout slogans like Bharat will be your piece
 kya he court kaa faisla?supreme court ne is maamle kii swatantra jaanch karaane kii apil ko khaarij kar diya he
 The court has said that there is no basis for the case, so it will not be investigated
 teen jajon kii bench ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki chaar jajon ke bayaan par andeh kaa koi kaaran nahin he, unpar andeh karnaa santhaan par andeh karne jaisaa hoga
 The apex court said that an attempt is being made to discredit the judiciary for this matter
 supreme court ne sunwaayee karte hue yachikakartaon ko fatkaar lagaai
 The Supreme Court said that the lawyers who have filed this petition have tried to defame the judiciary through it
 ye adaalat kii aapraadhik avmaananaa karne jaisaa he
 The apex court said that this petition was done to question the political benefits and the process of judiciary
 yachikakarta ne daleel di he ki 83 fisadi dalit or 71 fisadi saamaanya mahilaon ke alaava 56 fisadi purush is kanoon se prabhavit hue hai

 Monday, the first trading day of the week, does not look much better for Indian markets
 ek taraf sensex or nifti dhalaan par hai to rupaya bhi kamjor he
 The weakness of this weakness was that the rupee fell nine paise to 63 against the US dollar in early trade
 56 par aa gaya
 While the rupee 63 during Friday trading
 47 par band hua tha
 Why the rupee fell? Market experts believe that the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by the end of the year
 is khabar se dollar kii achanak maang bad gai he or iskaa asar rupee par bhi pad rahaa he
 If the demand for the dollar keeps increasing like this, then the dollar will continue to strengthen and the rupee will weaken

 Former Finance Secretary Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as the new Governor of Reserve Bank of India
 is niyukti par puri duniya kii najar tiki he
 Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel of the world's largest democracy, the second-largest market and the third-largest economy, resigned amidst a pull of autonomy with the country's government
 rigerv bank or sarkaar ke bich jari vivaad ke mahatv ke dekhte hue choubees ghante ke andar desh main bade aarthik faislon ko lagu karne vaale ritred iees adhikari das ko rigerv bank kii kaman saunp di he
 Das, who implemented important economic decisions like demonetisation and GST, was appointed a member of the Finance Commission of the Central Government after retirement from the civil service
 das aise samay main rigerv bank kii kaman sambhaal rahe hai jab rigerv bank ke saamne kendra sarkaar se chal rahi swaittata kii khinchataan ke saath-saath sust gharelu arthvyavastha or vaishvik str par gambhir chunautiyaan khadi hai
 5 Challenges of RBI Governor: Number one - The biggest challenge in front of Ekashikant Das is to save the credibility of the Central Reserve Bank
 jis tarah se pichley do governor urjit patel or raghuram rajan ne kendra sarkaar se khinchataan ke bich istipha diya, das ke saamne jald se jald is khinchataan ko khatm karte hue kendriya bank kii swaittata ko sunishchit karnaa hoga
 Central banks of all countries play a very important role in the global economy and it is ideal for them to be autonomous from their governments
 aise main das ko bataur arabiai governor is chunauti par khara utarana he
 It is significant that at present, Das is also the Sherpa (representing) of the Central Government in the G-20 organization
 chunauti number-dokendriya rigerv bank ke governor ko teen saal ke liye niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Generally, the tenure of the Governor is extended in the global economy, giving the Central Bank Governor enough time to operate the economy for 15 to 20 years
 jahaan raghuram rajan kaa kaarykaal nahin badha, vahiin urjit patel bich kaarykaal main nijee kaarnon ke chalate chale gaye, shaktikant das kii chunauti hogi ki vah teen saal ke apane pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan gharelu or vaishvik aarthik sthiti ke akalan par maudrik niti nirdhaarit karen or kendra sarkaar se behatar saamanjasy sthapit karen
 Challenge number three: Shaktikanta Das decides what stance the central government needs to improve RBI
 purv ke governron ne kendra sarkaar dwaara arabiai main badlaav kaa virodh kiya he
 For some time, the Central Bank has tightened its policies in the banking sector in the country
 iske chalate desh ke sarkari bainkon ke saamne karj lene or dene kaa kaam behad sakht hua he
 Its impact on the economy is being seen, but banks have a serious problem of serious non-performing assets (npas)
 lihaaja, bainkon ke enpie main sudhaar kii nitiyon ko sanchalit karnaa rigerv bank ke nae governor kii badi chunauti he
 Challenge No
 4: The biggest issue facing inflation remains the government
 mahangaai ko ahm aadhaar banaate hue kendriya bank apni nitiyaan nirdhaarit karata he
 Increasing or decreasing the interest rates of banks is also decided on the basis of inflation in the country and globally
 vaishvik str par opek or rus dwaara kaccha tel utpaadan main katautee karne ke elaan ke baad se ek baar phir kachche tel kii keemton main ijapha ho rahaa he
 While the biggest economic relief to the country during the last four years was crude oil available at a cheaper rate, the task of controlling inflation became easier for the central government and the RBI
 vaishvik sthiti palatney par arabiai kii mahangaai kaabo karne kii ahm chunauti he
 Challenge number-five: With the clarity and better monetary policy on the issue of autonomy from the central government, the key challenge of the central bank is how the country's economy can be taken forward given the current domestic economic situation and global challenges
 desh main bade nivesh kaa rasta saaf karnaa, vaishvik arthvyavastha main kaarobaari sugamawa ke maapdand par behatar karnaa or gharelu kaarobaar ko badhaane ke liye kin nitiyon kaa sahaara lenaa kendriya bank kii behad ahm chunauti hogi

 India did well both bowling and batting

 chinnaswami stadium main teen ghante ke abhyaas satr ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha, ‘hamen sachin kii kami khalegi
 He said, "as a nation and a player, we are disappointed that Sachin is retiring from ODI cricket before this series as he started his ODI career against Pakistan
 unki maharath ko ham hi nahin puraa vishwa maidan par yaad karegaa
 He is a great player of this game
 ’tej gendbaaj sohail tanwir ne kaha, ‘maine unke khilaaf gendbaaji kaa bahut lutf uthaaya he
 It was so difficult to bowl against them that there was not the slightest mistake that they would deliver the best ball across the boundary line
 bharat ke liye unhone jo uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai use shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He deserves the highest honor in the cricket fraternity
 ’tej gendbaaj umr gul ne kaha, ‘sachin ke khilaaf gendbaaji karnaa hameshaa chunautiyon se bharaa rahaa he or unka wicket hasil karnaa apane aap main sukhad rahaa he kyonki vah gend ko jis tarah padhate hai utana koi nahin pard saktaa
 'gul said,' India should feel proud of Sachin
 sirf unki upasthiti ne do dashakon tak bhartiya cricket khilaadiyon kii maidan par hausala afjai kii he
 He has inspired players like Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina to reach this point and in the coming days more players will continue to take inspiration from them

 usee din se 17 saal ke bashmaakh ke dimag main ek hi baat gunjane lagi ki vah dil lagaakar padhegaa or apane parivaar kaa sir ooncha karegaa
 He started working hard every day for hours
 vah vigyaan jaise apane pasandida vishay kii jatiltaaon ko samajhane main puri-puri raat guzaar detaa
 The result was seen in the 2010 Higher Secondary Examination

 Of course the test result gave him immense satisfaction

 Today is the death anniversary of former Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi
 vah desh ke saatven or bhartiya itihaas main sabase kam umr ke pradhanmantri the
 He was assassinated today, on 21 May 1991 by banned LTTE militants
 ve raajnneeti main nahin aana chaahate the
 But the situation became such that he entered politics and his name was recorded as the youngest PM of the country
 aaie jaanate hai kaise bane vah desh ke sabase yuva pradhanmantri
 
 
 - Rajiv Gandhi was born on 20 August 1944
 -1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad ve pradhanmantri bane
 Rajiv Gandhi had no interest in politics and worked as an airline pilot and was happy with that
 lekin apatkaal ke uparaant jab indira gandhi ko satta chhodani padi thi
 At the same time, after the death of younger brother Sanjay Gandhi in an airplane crash in 1980, he entered politics to support Mother Indira
 rajeev gandhi ko punyatithi par desh kar rahaa yaad, sonia-rahul pahunche vir bhoomi-rajeev gandhi 1984 se 1989 tak desh ke pradhanmantri rahe
 He was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber during the general election campaign in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991
 -rajeev gandhi saal 1966 main britain se profeshnal payalat banakar laute
 They flew on the delhi-jaipur-agra route
 jab ve pradhanmantri bane tab unki umr 40 saal 72 din thi
 - MTNL, VSNL and PCO are the result of their tenure
 desh ne telecom kranti bhi unke daur main hi dekhi
 - Rajiv Gandhi is married to Sonia Gandhi
 rajeev gandhi se unki mulaakaat tab hui jab rajeev cambridge main padhane gaye the
 Priyanka and i have completely forgiven Papa's killers: Rahul Gandhi - Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia got married in 1968
 unke do bachche hai- putr rahul gandhi or putree priyanka gandhi
 His son Rahul Gandhi is currently the president of the Congress
 -rajeev gandhi saal 1991 main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shreeperumbudur main littey ke aatmghaatee hamale kaa shikaar hue the
 a female attacker named Dhanu blew herself up after touching Rajiv Gandhi's feet
 is hamale main rajeev gandhi ke alaava 14 or logon kii jaan chali gai thi
 Rajiv Gandhi was the father of Digital India - Rajiv Gandhi is credited with bringing computer revolution in India
 unhone naa sirf computer ko bhartiya ghar tak laane kaa kaam kiya balki bharat main information technology ko aage le jane main ahm role nibhaayaa
 The country's two big telecom companies MTNL and VSNL started during his tenure
 (jawaharlal nehru bharat ke pehle digital computer ke saath)- bataa den, duniya ko pehla computer 1940 ke aakhir main mila, lekin bharat ne pehali baar 1956 main computer kharida
 Then it was priced at Rs 10 lakh and its name was HEC-2M
 sabase pehle ise kolkata ke indian statistical institute main install kiya gaya
 The computer then was not the same and it was quite big
 haalanki, yugers ke liye bharat main computers kaaphi baad main aae
 Let me tell you that, in 1984, Rajiv Gandhi laid the foundation of the Microcomputers Policy as soon as he became Prime Minister
 iske tahat privet sector kii companiyon ko 32 bit computers banane kaa adhikaar mila
 On the second day of the agenda till date, 'desi Girl' Priyanka Chopra also spoke on her cinema and life
 unhone bataaya ki vah jaldi bor ho jaati hai, isliye dance, acting, singing sab karti rahati hai
 Referring to the ongoing preparations for boxer Mary Kom to play a role on the screen, Priyanka said that she has learned a bit of boxing for the film and now she also boxed wearing high heels
 or kai muddon par boleen priyanka, padhie unheen kii jubaani
 
 
 With the role of Boxer Mary Kom, you will see my balls in a few days
 jab bhi log byopic karte hai to akasar aisa hota he ki unki jindagi kaa vah sunaharaa daur puraa ho chukaa he
 But Mary Kom is still active
 to bahut mushkil tha
 i am treating it as the story of every girl
 yah har us ladki kii kahani he, jise bataaya gaya he ki tumhen is tarah se chalanaa he, aise karnaa he
 As Mary Kom breaks the barrier, millions of other girls also break
 training ke dauraan mujhe bahut achche se boxing aa gai he
 Now i can box in high heels too
 marathon bhi daud sakati hum
 (priyanka also stands up and gives boxing tips) Mary Kom does not like to get her nails cut
 lambey nakhun hai or un par nail polish saji rahati he
 In such a situation, he got a lot of injury due to boxing
 magar maine is role kii practice ke dauraan apane nakhun katwa liye
 By the way, i have never been in this sport
 to bahut mushkil training rahi
 You cannot act in a game
 mujhe gym janaa pasand nahin
 Don't like dieting
 magar is film kii training ke liye bahut kuch karnaa padaa
 After a 6-hour boxing practice, some fed weed
 main ek chopra hum, to sochie punjabi ke saath kitna atyaachaar he
 i don't think there's anyone in the field to compete
 vaise indian film actraces se bahut poocha jaataa he ki number van or tu koun he
 Who is ahead, who is behind
 magar main khud ko kismat vaali maanati hum ki har saal mujhe kuch acchhee filmein mil jaati hai
 This is how Barfi's role got me
 It was the most exciting role in my life
 anuraag basu mere ghar se aae
 i returned from shooting
 vah baithe drawing room main
 After five minutes hello hi said - now let me go
 maine poocha ki bataaie, kuch baat thi kya
 But he did not say
 maine poocha-kya hua to bole main film ke liye aayaa tha
 But you will not speak
 tum nahin karogi
 When Priyanka asked forcibly, she narrated the role
 ek otistic ladki he
 So Priyanka asked that many people have done this role
 anuraag bole ki jab tak main kisi ladki ko real main cast nahin kar letaa, is kairactor ko thik se likh nahin paaungaa
 i told him, just give five days and what happened after that is in front of you
 gaanaa kyon gaaya mainemujhe viraasat main mila he
 My father was a singer
 bahut acha gaate the
 He was a doctor, but in the army, he was called a singing surgeon
 to main bachapan se hi gane lagi
 Papa's dream was that i should become a singer
 jab universal ne mujhase elbum kii baat kii, to dead bahut excited ho gaye
 It was three or four years ago
 tab unki tabiyat bhi kharaab chal rahi thi
 But he was very happy
 ab lagata he ki ye papa kaa sapana he, to zyada se zyada behatar dhang se karnaa chahie
 How much does the rumors affect? I remain private
 politicali karact yaa kuch or nahin hum
 i think 90 percent i give to the public through acting
 to 10 fisadi apane or family ke liye banataa hi he na
 Think of it like this
 raat main ham ghar par hote hai
 They are in pajamas before bedtime
 kai baar ghanti bajte hi ham goun pahan lete hai
 It all happens with the instruction
 hamen pataa hota he ki kitna personal hona he yaa nahin
 The same thing is about the industry
 kab pajama main rahanaa he, kab goun ke saath
 i am a public person but i am a girl and i have the right to keep my personal life to myself
 mujhe afvaahen zyada prabhavit nahin karatin
 But when people, journalists or writers leave their opinion without knowing the truth, then there is a problem
 papa kii anguthi kaa kissa kya he?mere papa ne mujhe bahut laad diya he
 That's why Daddy's Little Girl is written on my wrist
 mujhe nahin pataa ki kitni betiyon ko apane papa se itnaa pyaar miltaa he
 That his father should be his best friend
 main unase har baat kar sakati thi
 There was also shame of the eyes
 aisa hi life partner bhi chahie mujhe
 When Dad gave me this precious ring, it was a symbol
 ki jo bhi meri jindagi main aayega, use itnaa hi khyal rakhana hoga
 But the news kept flying in the media about who gave this ring to Priyanka
 kya karan johar camp main aapaki entry band he?haa mere karan johar se kuch matbhed hai
 i will not deny it
 hamane ek maheene baat nahin kii
 But now everything is fine maine haal main coffee vid karan kiya
 So i get everything right now ladakiyon ko lekar samaaj main pabandi ko lekarajab main 18 saal kii thi to mujhe 10 baje tak ghar lautnaa hota tha
 This was my father's rule
 har ghar main head of da family tay karata he
 i cannot sit here and say how long girls should stay outside or not
 magar hamaare desh ke culture ko ham din par din baandhne vaala na banaaen
 Modesty depends on the family
 ise baaki sab log aap par nahin thope sakate
 'rock on 2' did not do well at the box office
 bhartiya geetkaar or rajyasabha ke purv saansad javed akhtar ne apane bete kii film 'rock on 2' ke bare main kaha he ki yah kahana bevakoofi hogi ki notebandi ke kaaran 'rock on 2' box offis par acchhee kamai nahin kar saki
 Javed Akhtar said, 'if i say that demonetisation has affected only one film' Rock On2 'then it would be a stupid statement
 akhtar media se royal stag beral select perfect strox kii ore se yojit ek kaarykram main bol rahe the
 In 2008, the sequel to 'rock On', 'rock On' was released on November 11 and demonetisation was announced on the night of November 8
 film ne pehle din box offis par bharat main 2
 02 crores was earned
 aam aadmi party ko emsidi chunaav se khaasi ummiden thim
 But the decision of the people of Delhi has turned them on
 apane hi garh main mili maat ke baad ab arvind kejariwal ke liye siyaasi raah or kathin ho gai he
 Tell you how these results will increase Kejriwal's difficulty
 dharaa rah jayega baaki rajyon kaa sapana?bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan se siyaasi party main tabdeel hone ke vakt hi arvind kejariwal or unke sipahasalaron ne saaf kiya tha ki wo shuruyaat bhale hi dilli se kar rahe hai lekin har rajya main janata ko congress or bijepi kaa vikalp denge
 After the victory in the 2015 election, there was a split in the party on the same issue
 yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan jaise netaaon kii raay thi ki aam aadmi party ko baaki rajyon main vistaar kii mahatvakanksha philhal chhod deni chahie or puraa dhyaan dilli main kiye gaye vaayadon ko puraa karne par lagaana chahie
 These differences were ultimately the reason for his leave from the party
 iske baad aam aadmi party ne maharashtra, gujarat, punjab or goa samet kai rajyon main siyaasi jameen talashne kii koshish kii he
 But after the results in the MCD election, the party's graph is bound to be affected in the rest of the states
 log puch sakate hai ki jab dilli kii janata ne sthaneey muddon par hi kejariwal par yakeen nahin kiya to baaki rajyon ke log party kii nitiyon par bhala kyon muhar lagaaein? emsidi chunaav ke nateezon ke baad party ke ranneetikaron ko is sawaal kaa jawaab khojna hoga
 How will Kejriwal be the face of the opposition? All political pundits agree that there is a lack of strong opposition in the country's politics
 rahul gandhi khud ko majboot netaa ke taur par sthapit karne main naakaam rahe hai or baaki partiyaan apane-apane asar vaale rajyon se baahar koi khaas karishma nahin kar pai hai
 In such a situation, to challenge the BJP, the opposition parties are looking for a face that can be presented to the public against Modi
 bihar ke siem nitish kumaar or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne khud ko isi qatari ke netaa ke taur par project karne kii koshish kii he
 Kejriwal's supporters have also been branding him as an alternative to Modi
 yahi vajah he ki kejariwal ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main varanasi jaakar modi ko sidhi takkar di thi
 He has been challenging Modi on his policies and decisions for days to come
 lekin apane hi garh main mili is karaari haar ke baad ye saaf he ki kejariwal dilli main hi apni siyaasi jameen bachaane ke liye jujh rahe hai
 In such a situation, people will see him as an alternative to Modi in the whole country, there is deep doubt
 dilli main badalani hogi ranneeti?aam aadmi party jab saamaajik andolan thi to use madhyam varg ne haathon haath liya tha
 But in the political land of Delhi, the party insisted on wooing the people of the lower classes
 chaahe autowale hon yaa phir jhuggiyon main rahane vaale log, party ke agenda main unke sarokaar sabase upar hone kaa daawa kiya gaya
 The Aam Aadmi Party hoped that its plans would strengthen its base among these sections through schemes like cheap electricity, cheap water and Mohalla Clinic
 emsidi chunaav ke baad ab party ko sochna hoga ki wo aisi koun si nitiyaan apanaae jisase naa sirf loar middle class or garib varg ke voter uske paas bane rahen, balki apper middle class, khaskar yuva bhi party par dobaaraa vishwaas kar saken
 With the MCD elections, the Congress has also proved that it has not disappeared in Delhi
 lihaaja aam aadmi party desh kii rajdhani main apana raaj bachaae rakhane ke liye naa sirf bijepi kii chunauti se nipatna he balki congress ke kambek ko lekar bhi nai ranneeti banani he
 Questions will arise on the leadership? Since its birth, the Aam Aadmi Party has been facing dissidents
 party se baahar jane vaale netaaon kaa silsilaa shaayad hi kabhi thama he
 After this defeat, cracks may deepen within the party
 kai or netaa hawa kaa rukh bhaanpate hue bijepi yaa congress kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 Till now Kejriwal has unquestionably been the number-1 leader of the Aam Aadmi Party
 ye mumkin he ki is haar ke baad party ke bheetar kejariwal ke netritv or kaam karne ke tareekon par kumaar vishwaas jaise netaa sawaal uthaaen
 Party leader Bhagwant Mann has also questioned the party after the results
 centre sarkaar ke saath badhegaa takaraav?dilli main arvind kejariwal kaa ab tak kaa kaarykaal centre sarkaar or alji ke daftar ke saath unke takaraav kii vajah se surkhiyon me aata rahaa he
 The Modi government has not missed any opportunity to surround the Aam Aadmi Party government
 emsidi chunaavon main haar ke baad bijepi or zyada aakraamak sur main ye daawa kar sakegi ki dilli kii janata ab kejariwal ke saath nahin, balki modi ke saath he
 Therefore, there is a possibility of increasing the bond between the Central Government and the Delhi Government
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 MCD Result Referendum for Kejriwal, start writing resignation: Manoj Tiwarijan What is RIGHT TO RECALL, why did Kejriwal get stuck? Taunted Kejriwal on social media salmaan khan kii film 'tubalite' parde par dastak de chuki he

 film kaaphi imotional he or film main main kaaphi baar roi bhi
 Salman in the film, in a character whose mind is not able to develop, due to which everyone calls him Tubelight
 amit ne bataaya, mujhe film kaaphi everej lagi
 Salman had a film so thought that there would be a lot of entertainment but i was bored
 film main real life bhai sohail or salmaan kii chemistry bhi darshakon ko pasand ai
 Photos of Shah Rukh leaked from Tubelight, Hemant, who came to watch the first day of the show in the role of a magician, said, i liked the chemistry of these two
 vaaki agar khud par vishwaas ho to aap kuch bhi hasil kar sakate hai
 Also, the performance of Chinese actress Joo Joo and child artiste Matin won the hearts of fans
 'tubalite' ko opening bhale hi thandi mili ho lekin film ko ekstended weekend kaa phayda milegaa
 It will be interesting to see how fast Salman's 'tubelight' at the box office gets flickering in the coming days
 computer or mobile jaise gagetts banane vaali duniya kii sabase pratishthit company appal ab jald hi bharat main apane 500 store kholane ja rahi he
 However, Apple's 'big bosses' attitude towards India was something else earlier
 lekin ab teji se badhati hui bharat kii mobile market ke chalate appal ne apni pehle kii avadharanaon se kinaaraa kar liya he
 There is no shortage of Apple's fans around the world and in India too there is no less of a desire for Apple iphone, ipad tablet and ipod media player
 shuruyaat main company desh ke bade shaharon main 500 ‘ioes’ store kholane kaa plan bana rahi he, iske baad chote shaharon par bhi appal kii najar he
 The $ 700 billion company has been present in the US market in India since 2011, but does not have a presence in other countries like China
 jabaki appal se kadi takkar lene vaali korian company samsung bhartiya mobile bazaar par raaj karti he

 bhagava rang ab sarkari mahakamen ke sir chadhakar bol rahaa he
 CM Yogi's favorite color has now started climbing government buildings, but the surprise is that now the officers have started to paint the saffron color even to the police station
 mukhyamantri yogi bhagavadhari hai or jab yogi ko bhagava rang pasand he, to afasar se lekar netagan sabhi chaah rahe hai kii sarkari mahakamon kii imaaraton kaa rang aakhir bhagava kyon na kara diya jaae
 Somewhere the building of the police station has gone saffron color, while elsewhere vegetable market and jaggery market have been painted saffron
 yahi nahin haal hi main hue nagar nikaay chunaav ke baad bijepi ke kabje vaali nagar palikaon kaa rang bhi bhagava hona shuru ho gaya he
 The police station was painted in saffron color
 In Uttar Pradesh, the police station has also started making the government happy
 iske liye krime rate kam karne kii bajaae ye log bhagava rang ke bahaane sarkaar kii khushaamad main jute hai
 This is the reason why Afzalgarh police station of Bijnor has been completely painted with saffron color
 maatr thane par laga police kaa board hi police color main rah gaya he, varanaa puri thane kii building ko bhagava rang se rang diya gaya he
 Each room built inside the police station is decorated with saffron
 thane main aane vaale log bhagava rang ko dekhakar chaunk to rahe he, saath hi is rang ko lekar tarah-tarah kii baaten bhi kar rahe hai
 Saffronisation of Nagar Panchayat buildings also started After the bjp's victory in the municipal elections in Uttar Pradesh, now the Panchayat buildings have also started saffronization
 taaja udhaaharan devaria janapad ke laar nagar panchayat bhawan kaa hai, jahaan bijepi ke adhyaksh pad kii pratyaashee kii jeet ke baad do din ke bheetar hi puure bhawan ko bhagava rang main rang diya gaya
 Not only this, standing water tank, tractor was also painted
 is sambandh main jab bijepi kii saroj devi ke pati or pratinidhi jagadish yadav se poocha to unka kahana he kii puraa desh jab bhagava rang main rang gaya to kya gunaah ho gaya
 This has been done by mixing the donations of our workers with their will and support, while the newly elected councilor says that this is the first time
 pehle sapa or basapa kii sarkaar thi, lekin kisi ne apane party ke rang main bhawan ko nahin rangavaaya tha
 Local citizens say that saffron is a symbol of our country's culture
 mandi samitiyon par bhi padaa asarye bhagava rang sirf thanon par nahin chadha
 Its effect is also visible in market committees
 bijanour ke nazibabad kii mandi samiti ko bhi bhagava rang main rang diya gaya he
 The entire building of Mandi Samiti has been painted saffron
 ab har taraf bhagava hi bhagava najar aa rahaa he
 The same situation also exists in the agricultural production market of Barot in Baghpat
 ye mandi bhagava rang main bhi rangi hui najar aa rahi he
 No government order has been given, whether it is from the main gate or the mandi board, all are seen in saffron
 mandiyon kii deevaaron par bhi jo slogan likhe hai, wo bhi bhagava rang main najar aa rahe hai
 Saffron color is seen everywhere in the market
 meerut mandal main jahaan 22 mandia hai, vahiin saharanpur mandal main 15 mandiyaan hai
 All these mandis are seen colored in saffron
 is bare main jab rajya krishi utpaadan mandi parishad ke dipti diarector pushparaj singh se baat kii gai to unka kahana he ki ye koi sarkari aadesh nahin he, balkisvachh bharat abhiyaanke tahat mandiyon main vishesh safai abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he or kesariyaan rang pragati kaa pratik he

 The results of the election were highlighted by how effective the issue of separate Bundelkhand state was in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 bundeli matadaataaon ne alag rajya kii maang karne vaale aguva netaaon ko buree tarah se nakaar diya
 Less than one percent of Bundeli voters have supported a separate Bundelkhand state
 pruthak rajya kii maang ko lekar aage rahe film abhinayta raja bundela ko sirf 1897 mat hi mil paae, matlab saaf he
 Film actor and founding president of Bundelkhand Congress, Raja Bundela, has been scouring the trails here for a long time on the issue of making Bundelkhand a separate state
 isi mudde par unhone congress kaa saath chhod bundelkhand congress kaa gathan kiya or chunaav bhi ladaa lekin vidhansabha chunaav main unka prayaas bematlab sabit hua
 Apart from himself, Raja Bundela also fielded 11 other candidates from his debutant party, but the result was cipher
 pruthak rajya ko chunavi mudda banane vaale is dal ke 12 ummidavaaron ko kul 24 hajaar 78 mat hi mili, jo ek fisadi se bhi kam hai
 At the time of the election, after the Mayawati government passed a resolution to divide the state into four states in the assembly, it seemed that not only the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) but other local parties and organizations would also make it an issue and the Bundeli voters But it will also have an impact
 lekin, jahaan basapa ne khud ise peeche dhakel diya, vahiin ekikrut party, bundelkhand navnirmaan sena va bundeli sena jaise sanghathan chunaav ladane se hi kataraa gaye
 Only Raja Bundela contested with 11 of his candidates and was also unexpectedly defeated
 raja bundela ko jhaansi nagar seat se sirf 1897 mat mili, jabaki unki party se chunaav lard rahe devraj gupta (banda) ko 566, atul kumaar (baberu) ko 1,364, mahendra pratap (tindwari) ko 387, dike singh (mahoba) ko 772, svarnima singh (raath) ko 768, kishorilaal (urai) ko 1,426, mohandas (madhaugarh) ko 1,005, amar singh (kalapi) ko 1,132, jagapat singh (garautha) ko 388, mukta soni (lalitpur) ko 10,766 evam brijesh kumaar (maharauni) ko 3,657 mat hi mil paae
 Bundela did not find any candidates from Naraini, Chitrakoot, Manikpur, Charkhari, Hamirpur, Babina and Mauranipur seats
 is prakaar kul ek fisadi se bhi kam bundeli matadaata vidhansabha chunaav main pruthak rajya kaa samarthan karte najar aae
 Raja Bundela said that in this election Bundeli was extremely angry with the ruling BSP, so the trend in favor of SP and Congress has become more as an alternative
 vah kehete hai ki phir bhi vah hataash nahin hai, pruthak rajya ke masale par janajagran jari rahegaa
 Yesterday, even though Bundeli agitated for the demand for a separate state, the results of this election proved that the voters here are not yet agreeing for a separate Bundelkhand state
 bhartiya janata party ne genhu kharid main sarkaar tathaa thekedaaron ke bich mileebhagat hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki bundelkhand main kisaanon kaa genhu bina kisi kamishankhori ke kharida janaa chahie
 BJP MLA from Hamirpur district in Bundelkhand, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said, "commissioning of wheat procurement is going on in Sumerpur mandi of Hamirpur
 unhone kaha ki bharua sumerpur mandi main kisaanon se gehun 1285 rupee main kharida ja rahaa he or usamen kisaanon se kamishan ke taur par 85 rupee liye ja rahe hai
 The wheat of the farmer who is paying commission is being purchased
 niranjan jyoti ne kaha ki mukhyamantri yah kehete hai ki ham kisaanon ke saath shat-pratishat nyaay karenge to phir kisaanon ke saath aisa vyavhaar kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 We demand from the government that the commission in wheat procurement should be disclosed and farmers' wheat should be purchased without commission
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ko lekar piem modi bijepi ko jitaane ke liye tabadatod reliyaan kar rahe hai
 In connection with the rallies today, Arunachal Pradesh (arunachal Pradesh) PM Modi (PM Modi) attacked the Congress fiercely
 piem modi ne congress ke ghoshnaptr ko dhakoslapatr bataaya or kaha ki congress ne kabhi vaade puure nahin kiye
 In the rally, he said that Congress had been in government for years here, but development work was not done here
 hamane paanch saal ke dauraan kai saare vikaas ke kaam kiye, magar hamen or bhi kaam karne kii jarurat he
 At a rally in Arunachal Pradesh, PM Modi said that all of you have planted a double engine of development in Itanagar and Delhi
 isi kaa parinaam he, aaj vikaas ke nae raste par arunachal chal padaa he
 Those who ruled for 70 years, a family ruled for 55 years, yet no one can claim that they have completed all the work of India
 mujhe to paanch saal abhi hone baaki hai, main bhala ye to daawa nahin kar saktaa hum ki maine saare daawey kar die hai, main har chunautiyon ko chunauti dene vaala insaan hum
 a person is willing to take even the toughest tasks at hand
 jo kaam haath main letaa hum, use puraa karne ke liye ji jaan laga detaa hum
 On the Congress manifesto, PM Modi said that on one side there is a government with intentions and on the other side there are only and only false promises
 in logon kii tarah hi inkaa ghoshnaptr bhi bhrasht hota he, beyimaan hota he, dhakoslon se bharaa hota he
 Therefore, it should be called a dhoksala letter, not a manifesto
 unhone kaha ki sardi garmi, barish, kaisaa bhi mausam ho, kisi bhi paristhiti ho, chaukeedaar paharaa dete hue ye bhi kahata he- jaagate raho
 That's why your watchman is telling you to stay awake
 inke bhrasht vaayadon se aapako aagaah kar rahaa he
 PM Modi said that in his defamation letter of 2004, he promised to provide electricity to every house in the country by 2009
 iske liye baqayada ek program bhi banaaya gaya lekin kaam puraa nahin hua
 In 2009, he again got another fraud
 pehle ke vaade kaa kya hua ye nahin bataaya
 Then came the election of 2014 and then made a promise that 100 percent electricity would be given in cities and 90 percent power in villages
 inke jhuthe vaadon kii sthiti ye thi ki arunachal or north east ke 1800 se adhik gaanv or desh ke 3 karod se adhik parivaar 2014 main andhere main jeene ke liye majaboor the
 This watchman aimed to deliver electricity within a thousand days and fulfilled the promise within a thousand days
 piem modi ne kaha ki itnaa hi nahin congress ne desh main algaavvaad badhaane ke liye, hinsa ko protsaahan dene ke liye, desh ko gaali dene waalon ko protsaahan dene kii bhi ek yojana banaai
 Those who burn the tricolor flag insult those who shout slogans like 'jai Hind' not like you, Bharat will be your piece, who play in foreign hands, who insult our heritage, who is Baba Saheb's The Congress has sympathy with those who break the idols
 piem modi ne kaha ki ek taraf aapkaa ye chaukeedaar, desh ke vir sapoot, desh ko todane waalon ke khilaaf khadaa ho rahaa he
 Whether inside the country or outside the country, this watchman is taking action against those who attacked Mother India
 vahiin duusari taraf vichaaron se diwalia ho chuki congress party, satta main vaapasi kii chatapataahat main aaj is str par pahunch gai he
 Is this not an attempt to strengthen the voice of secession in the country? The hand of the Congress is with the country or with the traitors of the country
 unhone aage kaha ki aap aashwast rahiye, jab tak ye chaukeedaar he, tab tak desh ko todane ke bare main sochane waalon ko sau baar sochna padegaa
 We are people who live and die for one India, the best of India
 yahi arunachal ke aap sabhi saathiyon kii prerana he, yahi 130 karod bharatvasiyon kaa pran he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at an election rally in Arunachal Pradesh that in Arunachal Pradesh, many institutions are being formed in education and health, it is a symbol of your trust
 aapaki hi vajah se ham aazaadee ke saat dashak baad bhi arunachal ke sabhi gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaa paae hai
 We have been able to illuminate every house
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamane swasthya ke naam par badi-badi lubhaavni baaten nahin kin, phir bhi duniya kii sabase badi swasthya yojana ayushmaan bharat yojana lagu kii
 Due to which free treatment facility was implemented
 swasthya yojana itani badi yojana he ki duniya kii sabase badi yojana he
 On the one hand, those parties which never understood the hopes and aspirations of the country, who kept the power occupied with the intention of ruling the country
 jabaki aapkaa ye chaukeedaar, aapke sevak kii tarah kaam kar rahaa he: PM modi a man overseeing a shrine in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's province of Punjab, left an electrician just because he asked for his work
 sher ke hamale main use kai chotein ai hai
 According to the report published in Pakistani media, the act of leaving a pet lion on the electrician was done by the manager of an Imam Bargah
 uske khilaaf hatya ke prayaas kaa maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 The incident took place on September 9 in which the electrician was injured
 police ne bataaya ki imam bargah sadaae hossain ke prabandhak ali raja ke khilaaf hatya ke prayaas kaa maamla do din pehle shikaayat milane ke baad darj kiya gaya
 Electrician Rafiq Ahmed did not register any complaint immediately after the incident
 usne kaha ki vah ali raja ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karaane par isliye majaboor hua kyonki raja ne vaade ke mutabik use ilaaj ke liye paisa nahin diya or na hi kaam kaa mehtaanaa diya
 He was constantly trying for this for the last one month from Raza
 is maamle main darj praathmiki ke anusaar electrician rafique se ali raja ne imam bargah main kuch kaam karaayaa or mehtaanaa kuch din main dene kii baat kahi
 After this, Raza did not give money even after Rafiq repeatedly said, and one day when Rafiq reached to ask for money, Raza left his pet lion on him, in which his face and hands got injured
 sher ke hamale par jab rafique chillaaya to aasapaas ke logon ne hastkshep kiya jisase uski jaan batch saki

 Bigg Boss, the most controversial show on TV, has started
 29 sitambar ko raat 9 baje salmaan khan ne sho kaa premier shandaar andaaj main kiya
 As soon as the show starts, it is believed that Bigg Boss is going to give a complete competition in the case of TRP to the other shows of the TV world
 lekin is sho kii shuruyaat se sabase badi samasya khud salmaan khan ke saath shuru hone vaali he
 The reason for this is the timing of Bigg Boss
 darasal, salmaan khan kaa sho big bos 13 roj raat 10
 Will come 5 days a week at 30
 uske baad shanivaar or ravivaar salmaan khan lekar aaenge weekend kaa war
 There are only two days in Bigg Boss when Salman Khan comes and understands the book of householders and explains
 puraane big bos sijan par najar daalen to weekend kaa war ko sabase zyada tiarapy milti he
 Now the issue is that even after Salman Khan gets TRP, what is the problem
 to wo he salmaan khan kaa doosraa sho da kapil sharma sho
 Bigg Boss Contest with The Kapil Sharma Show: Salman Khan has stepped into The TV Industry from The Kapil Sharma Show for the first time
 salmaan khan ne sho ke prodction kaa jimmaa uthaaya he
 Salman Khan has a big budget in the show
 da kapil sharma sho kii timming hafte main do din shanivaar or ravivaar samay 9 baje he
 The Kapil Sharma Show is also a superhit in the TRP chart
 lekin is sho kii takkar ab hone vaali he big bos se
 In such a situation, whether TRP Bigg Boss or Kapil Sharma show is the loss of Salman Khan in both
 da kapil sharma sho kii tiarapy par big bos kaa asar padaa to salmaan kaa paisa usamen laga he
 If Bigg Boss's TRP falls, Salman's stardom will be affected, because if the show that Sultan hosts and he does not run, then it will have little or no impact
 prime time ke sultan bane salmaan lekin fansaa ye penchsalmaan khan bollywood main box offis ke sultan kahe jate hai
 With this, he is seen to be dominating the TV industry
 salmaan ne pehali baar kapil sharma sho main paisa lagaaya or sho hit list main he
 On the other hand, there is no need to tell how popular Big Boss is
 in vakt do bade channels ke prime time par salmaan khan kaa jalawaa barkaraar he
 But for the first time Salman is to be confronted with Salman Khan himself
 aane vaali tiarapy reating main ye saaf ho jayega ki salmaan khan ke kis sho ko darshak zyada pasand karte hai
 It will be fun to see who will win the race as Salman Khan's race is going to be held by Salman Khan himself

 Rejecting Pakistan's claim of no involvement of government elements in terrorist activities against India, Home Minister p Chidambaram said on Friday that lashkar-e-taiba and other terrorist organizations in that country were getting support from the ISI and they In this country we have established our own modules and sleeper cells
 unhone ‘india today kanklev' main kaha, ‘agar aatankwaad ko pryojit karne kii rajya kii niti he, agar bharat main aatankwaad kaa niryaat karne kii rajya kii niti he to ham kaise rajya se niptenge
 The Home Minister said, "it is not a secret that every terrorist organization based in Pakistan is getting the support of ISI
" lashkar, hijbul mujahidin, jamaat ud daawa, al badr unamem se prayek ko iesai kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 He also made it clear that war is not an option
 unhone kaha, ‘tab hamen nishchit taur par baatcheet kerani chahie
 He said that nothing was gained from the talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries last month
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘lekin mujhase kaha gaya ki videsh sachiv str par anya daur kii baatcheet kaa vikalp ab bhi khulaa hai
 In his inauguration speech, Chidambaram did not mention Pakistan
 unhone paak pryojit aatankwaad par bharat kii chintaaon kaa izhaar prashnottar satr ke dauraan kiya
 He also had a war with Pakistani High Commissioner Shahid Malik
 malik ne mantri ke un aaropon kaa pratyuttar dene kii koshish kii ki bharat main aatankwaadi ghatnaon main pakistan ke sarkari tatv shaamil nahin he
 But Chidambaram immediately dismissed those claims, saying that if India gave a voice sample of the suspects whom India has handed over to Pakistan, it could be investigated
 unhone kaha, ‘26 november ke hamalaavaron or pakistan main unke aakaaon kii aawaaj ke ricard kaa america prayogshaala main milan kiya ja saktaa he
 Then we will find out whether the person is a government element or not
 ’ grih mantri ne kaha ki avrodh dur karne kaa yah ek tarika he
 He said, 'for the sake of argument only if we also accept that there is no hand of government elements, then it is not the responsibility of Pakistan to control or eliminate those non-government elements which promote terrorism from its soil
 Are giving ’ pakistan ko 1947 se hi kathin padosi qaraar dete hue unhone kaha, ‘kashmir ke ird-gird pakistan ke saath hamaari gambhir samasya he
 We believe it
 ’yah puche jane par ki agar 26 november kii tarah kaa hamalaa phir se hua to bharat kaa kya jawaab hoga to chidambaram ne kaha ki agar thos rup main ise sthapit kiya ja sakaa ki yah pakistani dharti se hua he to ‘ham teji se nirnaayak karrwai karenge
 Asked if it would be a military option, Chidambaram said, "when we take swift decisive action, you can comment on it
" ’kuwaiti rajdoot sami al suleman ke sawaal ke jawaab main chidambaram ne kaha ki 26 november ke hamale kaa mukhya sargana or lashkar tathaa jeyudi kaa sansthaapak hafiz said baar-baar apane aatankwaadi krityon ko uchit tehraane ke liye ‘jihad’ kii baat kar rahaa he
 Significantly, the Kuwaiti ambassador objected to the use of the term 'jihadi terrorism'
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘main dekhtaa hum ki hafiz said apane har bhaashan main is shabd kaa istemaal karata he
 He gave three speeches last month
 prayek bhaashan main usne jihad shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Despite the evidence against him, he is roaming freely
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main dekhtaa hum ki al kaayda netaa jihad shabd kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 i found Lashkar leaders using the word jihad
 hamaare paas mumbai hamale main shaamil hamalaavaron or unke aakaaon kii baatcheet kaa ricard he jisamen ve jihad shabd kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 So for the wrong reasons and unfortunately when terrorists use the word jihad, then those who oppose terrorism are forced to use the word jihad
 ’malik ne kaha ki pakistani pratinidhimandal is ummid se bharat aayaa tha ki kuch sakaaratmak nikalegaa
 He said, 'we came here with an open mind
 or hamase kaha gaya he ki aatankwaad baithak ke agenda kii mukhya baton main se ek he
 We welcomed it immediately
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘or uskaa kaaran tha ki hamen baluchistan main aatankwaad, afghanistan main bhartiya vanijyik duutavas aadi main gatividhiyon ke sandarbh main bharat ke samaksh apane muddon ko uthaanaa tha

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said the Trinamool Congress does not have sufficient numbers to bring a no-confidence motion against the Congress-led central government
 party ne kaha ki usne abhi yah tay nahin kiya he ki samarthan karegi yaa nahin, jabaki communist party of india (bhakpa) ne kaha ki vah trinmul kaa saath degi
 Senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi said here, "what is the benefit of bringing the no-confidence motion which falls

 Its leadership has to decide where the party will go on this issue

 After this came the statement of Murali Manohar Joshi
 gyaat ho ki mamata banerjee ne shanivaar ko ghoshnaa kii thi ki unki party sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke pehle din yani 22 november ko samprag sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laaegi
 He appealed for support from all parties for this
 udhar, congress ne bhi kaha ki trinmul congress ke paas centre sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane ke liye paryaapt sankhya nahin he
 For this, the Congress attacked Mamata Banerjee's party to seek support from the 'communal' party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
