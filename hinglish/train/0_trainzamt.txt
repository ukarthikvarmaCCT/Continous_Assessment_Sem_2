 Although the leaders of the party and other parties face to face with the alleged wave of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, the same wave of Modi has to be tested in Mithilanchal and Seemanchal of Bihar
 vaise kosi kshetra kii bhi kuch siten par bhaajapa ke ummidavaaron ko kathin pariksha se guzarana padaa he
 Polling for three of the six phases to be held in Bihar has been completed, while the fourth phase is scheduled for April 30

 Santosh Singh, a political analyst and journalist, says that the Muslim population in the state is 17 percent and there are 13 Lok Sabha constituencies in Seemanchal, Mithilanchal and Kosi areas where the Muslim population is between 18 and 44 percent
 vah kehete hai ki rajya main adhikansh siton par trikonatmak sangharsh he parantu muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya parinaam ko prabhavit karne kii sthiti main hai
 Santosh says that considering the voting of the three phases so far, there is a huge turnout at the polling stations in Muslim dominated areas, in such a situation it will be a matter of which party the Muslim voters are voting for
 vaise raajnneetik jaankaar yah bhi kehete hai ki is chunaav main argedy ko jahaan em-vaai (muslim-yadav) kaa bharpoor saath mil rahaa he vahiin bijepi ko modi lahar ke asar kaa saath he
 In this phase, the number of Brahmin voters in Darbhanga and Madhubani parliamentary constituencies is also significant
 aise main brahman matadaataaon kaa dhruvikaran bhi chunaav parinaam ko prabhavit karenge
 As the election date draws near, all parties have intensified campaigning
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke liye pratishtha kii seat bani madhepura (madhepura se jad (you) ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav chunaav lard rahe hai) main camp kar liye hai vahiin modi bhi madhubani, saharsa or darbhanga main chunavi sabha ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 Here, Lalu Prasad of RJD is also trying to woo voters by electoral assembly every day

 After the announcement of withdrawal of support by the Trinamool Congress from the Congress-led central government on the issue of diesel price hike, limiting the number of subsidized LPG cylinders and foreign direct investment (ADI) in retail, all eyes are now on the Samajwadi Party (SP ) President Mulayam Singh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati

 In the morning, where the BJP was seen occupying the chair, by the afternoon, the congress-jds also started queuing up
 shaam hote-hote gend raajnneetik kheme se nikalakar rajyapal ke paale main ja pahunchi he
 In the beginning of this hour-long change, the figures were seen leaning towards the BJP and it emerged as the largest party in the state, even though it lagged behind the majority figures
 duusari ore sattadhari congress ko nateezon main siton ke maamle main kaaphi nuksaan hua or vah duusari sabase badi party bani
 By evening, the Congress announced its support to the JDS unconditionally and both parties have also claimed to meet the Governor and form the government
 bijepi netaa bies yediurppa pehle hi rajyapal se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar chuke the
 So let us know what happened in the tight results of Karnataka today
 pal-pal badali tasveersubah jab voton kii ginati shuru hui to donon badi partiyaan bijepi or congress rujhaanon main aage-peeche chal rahi thim
 Sometimes the Congress would win, sometimes the BJP seats would increase
 jedies shuruyaat se hi number teen par rahakar rujhaanon main aage badhati rahi
 bjp's progress gradually increased and it was decided that it was going to do better than the last election
 congress kaa graph girtaa ja rahaa tha or jedies vahiin tisare sthaan par kabiz thi
 By noon, the BJP had crossed the 100-seat mark and from here it seemed quite easy to touch the magical figure of 112
 congress ko is vakt 50 se 60 siton kaa nuksaan hota saaf dikh rahaa tha
 Before the victory, the celebrations of the BJP leaders had started clearing the pictures of the celebrations of the BJP leaders
 party netaaon ne ek-duusare ko badhai dena bhi shuru kar diya tha, kyonki rujhaanon main bijepi 120 se zyada siten paati dikh rahi thi
 The defeat of the Congress was supposed to be decided and its contest was now from the third party JDS
 asal tasviir dopaher baad saaf hui jab rujhaan nateezon main badalane lage
 The results made it clear that no party was able to touch the majority figure and the JDS was emerging in the role of kingmaker
 jab jeet se aashwast ho chuki bijepi main jashn kaa maahaul tha tab congress alaakaman sarkaar banane kii kavayad main juty thi
 Suddenly, the Congress announced unconditional support for the JDS and agreed to make JDS leader Kumaraswamy as the Chief Minister
 kisi ko nahin mila bahumatsham hote-hote bijepi 104 siton par simat gai or use ab bhi bahumat ke liye 8 siton kii darkaar thi
 At the same time, Congress got 78 seats in the account, JDS also had a decisive 38 seats
 ab aise main bijepi ke liye akele sarkaar bananaa mushkil tha or congress-jedies kii kul 116 siten bahumat ke paar pahunch rahi thim
 There was a churn in both the parties to form a government
 dilli or bengalooru kii duuri bhi ghat rahi thi
 Senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot from the Congress had reached Bangalore in the morning and Union Minister Anant Kumar was already there on behalf of the BJP
 donon hi dalon ne rajyapal se milane kaa vakt maanga, lekin tab rajyapal kii ore se antim nateezon tak intjaar karne ke liye kaha gaya
 Meanwhile, leaders of the two parties, including Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, also held a meeting with JDS chief HD Deve Gowda at a hotel in Bengaluru in the evening
 tasviir saaf ho jane ke baad congress ke siddharmaiya ne pehle mukhyamantri pad se apana istipha diya
 After this, Yeddyurappa of BJP, being the largest party, claimed to meet the Governor and form the government
 iske thik baad kumaraswami or siddharmaiya ne bhi gathbandhan ko mili siton ke aadhaar par sarkaar banane kaa daawa rajyapal ke saamne rakhaa
 There is currently no indication from the Governor in the court of the ball from Governor Vajubhai Vala but it is believed that being the largest party, he will invite BJP to form the government
 haalanki manipur or goa main chunaav baad bane gathbandhan ke aadhaar par agar congress-jedies ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya jaataa he to in donon dalon ko sarkaar banane main koi dikkat nahin hogi
 Meanwhile, bjp's CM candidate BS Yeddyurappa claimed that he has been given 48 hours to prove his majority on behalf of the Governor
 sutron se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki jedies ke 5-6 vidhayak bijepi ke sampark main hai
 Away from the majority figure, the BJP is also trying to get mlas into its fold to gather the strength
 jaankaree yah bhi he ki congress apane vidhayakon ko gujarat rajyasabha chunaavon kii tarj parbengalooru se baharabhi bhej sakati he
 Currently, the picture of the formation of the government in Karnataka is not clear
 rajyapal ke nirdesh or bijepi kii koshishon par nirbhar karegaa ki rajya main kiski sarkaar banegi
 Meanwhile, the Congress and JDS have only the option of waiting

 But being Indian from the root, some of our habits remain the same even today
 inamen se kuch aadaten kai baar takalif detii hai to kai baar chehre par hansi le aati hai
 Interestingly, these habits have been set in our society
 inamen se kuch aadaton ko badalane kii sakht jarurat he to kuch ko jas ke tas bane rahane main hi sukh he
 Know ahead 10 such things of us Indians
 1
 Pissing on the street: always seen on the walls that the donkey is urinating
 lekin us diwaar ke paas hameshaa insaani 'jal' kii nami pai jaati he
 Nobody would have ever seen a donkey urinating near that wall
 arthath hamaare shaharon, kasbon main maano jaise rivaaj he ki jab lage to jagah na dekho bas kar do
 Lakh Swach Bharat Abhiyan banner 2
 In the daughter's marriage, the father's eye is bent, hands linked: the daughter is estranged
 jab tak dimag main ye maansikta rahegi, tab tak shaadi byaahon main lakhon rupee kharch karne ke baad bhi beti kaa pita haath jode khadaa rahata he
 Do not know what is the custom of this Dhekianusi civilization, in which the father of the daughter is seen in the wedding marriages
 lekin bharat ke alaava duusare deshon main beti kaa pita duulhe se zyada sajaa or chamakta hua dikhataa he
 3
 rothale serial or maa-bahanon kii deewangi:kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi, lekin asli sawaal ye he ki jab saas bahu thi tab bhi wo kya itane serial dekh paati thi, jitne aaj hamaare gharon main mummy, bhabhi, patni or bahanen dekh rahi hai
 The craze for serials in India is nowhere to be seen
 4
 Turning a human into a serpent: Remember the last procession you went to
 kam se kam ek shaks to aisa jarur mila hoga, jise aapane band kii aawaaj ke bich khuleam nagin rup dhaaran karte dekha hoga
 That is, rolling on the ground on the serpent tone
 kuch bhi kahie kisi bhi shaadi main agar ek nagin dekhne ko na mili, to shaadi ke maje main wo chaukasapana nahin aata
 5
 hamaara netaa kaisaa ho:aaazaad bharat se lekar ab tak hue kisi bhi chunaav ko uthaakar dekh lijie
 Every time leaders make unfounded promises
 paroshut ummidavaar utaare jate hai
 The MLA, MP has to work in our area
 lekin ham netaa chunate hai wo jo hamaari kisi party kaa cheharaa ho
 That is, even today, instead of choosing qualified candidates in India, we are not able to use the vote properly under a fixed mindset
 6
 The making of a girl's 'furniture' before marriage: The tradition of seeing a girl for marriage is almost the same in India today as it was before
 haalanki logon ke nazariye main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 But still for the son's wedding, the boy's family members look at the girl, as seen when buying any furniture
 7
 To be a little side, to be set: Rail, metro, bus, wedding or office is not a place where Indians do not go through the process of adjusting or getting it done
 baithne kii jagah kitne hi logon kii ho, lekin 'bhaiya jaraa edjust karnaa' naamak vaakya kaa istemaal kar samajashastri apane baithne kaa jugad bana hi lete hai
 8
 cricket- aisi deewangi dekhi nahin:mana ki hamaare desh main sachin tendulkar hai, lekin iskaa matlab ye to nahin ki har doosraa launda yaa mohatarama cricket ke liye deewangi jaahir karte hue dikh hi jaati hai
 Wow, Kohli Rocks Type
 duniya ke baaki deshon main bhi cricket khelaa jaataa he lekin cricket kii jeet ke liye 'katha, havan karaao' tip mohabbat sirf bharat main hi dekhi jaati he
 True, we are free now
 9
 Take me to your shelter, Lord: The examinations did not begin that instead of being close to books, we go to our country according to our own convenience and faith
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf fasebuk par likhane vaale log bhi bhagwaan ko prasad kii rishwat kaa vaada karne se nahin chookte hai
 10

 BJP national president Amit Shah has told booth workers in Delhi that our job is to create a system to win elections, so that only BJP will win for the next 25 years
 dilli ke chunaavon main is mekensm kaa prayog hoga
 If we succeed here, we will adopt the same method in Bihar
 aakhir vah koun sa system hoga, jiskaa prayog bijepi adhyaksh dilli ke chunaavon main karne ja rahe hai or jiske safal hone par agle 25 varshon tak chunaav jitate hi jaaenge
 It is clear from these statements that the election of Delhi is the most important for the BJP
 vah is chunaav ko haarana nahin chaahati, balki har keemat par jeetne ke liye utari he
 One example of this confidence is that three weeks before the election, the party brings a face to itself from outside and surprises the opponents
 yah sirf hawa par bharose ke dam par nahin kiya gaya hoga
 The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have announced their candidates, but the BJP candidates are not even aware of this article until it is written
 haalanki bijepi ne sirf ek chehre ke dam par daawa kar diya ki dilli main vah koi aisa prayog karne ja rahi he, jo safal hua to 25 saal tak koi use haraa hi nahin paaegaa
 The BJP Parliamentary Board is scheduled to meet on Monday, January 19, in which the ticket is likely to be announced
 pichley bees saal kii raajnneeti main sanghathan kii bhoomika har dal main kamazor hui he
 Before today's BJP, there was only one party, which gave priority to the organization and that was Bahujan Samaj Party
 isi ne booth management ko sanghathan kaa sabase majboot aadhaar banaaya
 Boards to district level coordinators were made, who were asked more than mlas and mps in the party
 lekin 2007 main uttar pradesh main purna bahumat milane ke baad mayawati kaa yah majboot kila kamazor padane laga or ab to yah bikhar hi gaya he, jise mayawati phir se sametane kii kavayad main juty hai
 The bsp's booth management was mentioned because on the lines of this, the Congress also implemented a coordinator system, but it was not very successful
 basapa ne har booth ke liye bastaa prabharee banaaya
 Each booth's voter information was kept in the bag
 bijepi main bhi isi tarah kaa panna prabharee banaaya gaya he
 As long as this stronghold of BSP was strong, it was difficult to demolish it, but BJP has become better than BSP in this matter
 isiilie dilli chunaav kaa jimmaa apane haath main lene ke baad rashtriya adhyaksh ne booth workaron ko sambodhit kiya or unhen josh se bhar diya
 But is it only the booth management that is the surest mantra to get power, with which BJP will never lose
 amit shah ne apni sarkaar ke kaaryakramon kii kamyaabi kaa bhi zikr kiya, lekin vah jaanate hai ki zamin par chunaav sirf prachaar or propeganda se nahin jeeta jaataa
 He needed a booth worker to convert into a win
 isiilie vah booth varkar ko bataa rahe hai ki kaise gali main nikalate hi chachaa pranaam, tai namaskara karte chalanaa he
 So has the Aam Aadmi Party given a challenge to the BJP on the ground
 do saal puraani party ko haraane ke liye bijepi itnaa sab kuch daanv par kyon laga rahi he? chunaav jeetna har dal kaa adhikaar or mukhya kaam he, lekin ek aise rajya ke liye jisaki purnataa kii maang hi hoti rahati he, bijepi itnaa bada daanv kyon khel rahi he? Kiran Bedi, who was brought from the national president, the Prime Minister and from elsewhere, one can say that BJP is nervous
 lekin bijepi ne haar maanane ke baad kya kiya
 Like the Congress, she did not sit at home, instead playing another wager by bringing Kiran Bedi
 ab bijepi main vah bhi siem ban saktaa he, jo aresas kaa nahin hoga
 Which will not be of BJP even before the week of becoming CM
 haalanki yah ek doharaa jokhim he
 The defeat may be double if defeated, but the BJP took the risk
 shaayad yahi khubi aaj kii raajnneeti main bijepi ko jeetne vaali team bana rahi he
 The question is not to get away from absolute majority or majority, but the question is of passion to achieve the goal of winning, which should be in every party
 shaayad ahankaar kii had tak
 One may find it egoistic which mechanism will be created that for 25 years no one will be able to beat
 itihaas jaanata he ki booth management vaali basapa ko samaajawaadee party ne uske khel main aasaani se haraa diya or akhilesh purna bahumat lekar aa gaye
 The SP also wrested reserve seats from the BSP
 aise main dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki bijepi kii is chunauti ko koun virdohi dal sabase pehle sweekaar karata he
 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has also said that BJP will win in Delhi in a landmark manner
 2019 tak bharat ke 29 rajyon main se 20 rajya jeetegi
 Do not know for whom 9 states Prakash ji has left and which 9 states they are
 kya pataa amit shah turant elaan kar den ki ham 29 ke 29 rajya jeetenge
 Whether it is self-confidence or over-confidence of faith, it can be said in many ways, but even after coming to power, the trend of keeping the party running seems new
 amit shah ne party ko jeetne kii mashinari main badal diya he
 Any winner can come in this machine
 aaj bijepi ke jite hue saansadon main sau se zyada purv congressi bataae jate hai
 Shazia Ilmi also includes Binny as a party event
 raajnneeti main yah to pehle bhi hua he lekin bijepi main yah sab aayaa ram gaya ram kii ranneeti ke tahat nahin ho rahaa he
 It is not gathering crowds, but those who can beat someone or who can be weak by coming, they are welcome in BJP
 bijepi lagaataar apane lakshyon ko bada karti ja rahi he, virdohi abhi tak lakshya hi nahin dhundh paa rahe hai
 Now the question arises whether BJP will really be the only BJP in the country
 agar amit shah ne chunaav jeetne kii aisi mashinari bana di to unhen patent to milanaa hi chahie
 Delhi's election is not like that
 bijepi ke liye 25 saal tak loktantr kii kaksha main chakkar lagane vaale raaket ke prakshepan kaa lonching pad he
 Keep an eye on Delhi's election, any such machine is going to be built

 We also know the measurement of the chest of one of these players
 iske baad main donon ke dimag kaa maap jaananaa chaahuungi
 The fans of the actor (in fact, both qualify as actors) are left wondering what Akshay gossip was doing to Modi
 
 
 ? akshay kumaar apane damakham ke liye jane jate hai
 Narendra Modi his
 
 
 apane damakham ke liye hi jane jate hai
 Both are matches in terms of dialogue
 bhale hi donon kii line ek hi jaisi bekaar hoti hai, phir bhi hamaara andaaza he ki donon kaa dialog lekhak ek hi nahin he
 Akshay talks more than his muscles, and Modi believes in muscle power
 nateeja ek jaisaa hi rahata he - screen or uske itar, dushman kaa sarvanaash
 Akshay Kumar is a fitness freak, neither smokes, nor drinks alcohol
 thik aise hi modi hai
 Boring
 
 
 donon subah jaldi uthne vaale hai
 Too many self-attention seekers
 akshay kumaar film industry ke sahyogiyon ke saath milte-julate nahin hai
 And there will not be too many people who would like to meet Narendra Modi regularly
 akshay kumaar ke paas tvinkal khanna hai
 Narendra Modi has Amit Shah
 aap khud hi sochie
 
 
 Now let's talk about the flop interview
 
 
 hamm
 
 
 Was it a simple, simple conversation in 'kesari Rang'
 film (akshay kii 'kesari') ne box offis par badhiya pradarshan kiya he, or use pradhanmantri kii sifarish kii zarurat nahin he
 Again
 
 
 ? sabase pehle dikhaai detaa he, akshay kaa lalachaane vaala twit
 Getting into an unknown and uncharted territory today
 Doing something i have never done before
 Excited and nervous both
 Stay tuned for updates
 And then everyone started waiting for the announcement - Akshay Kumar has joined BJP
 aisa nahin hua
 
 
 Since half of Bollywood's big stars are joining different political parties nowadays, and earning more from movies, people thought - come on, one more right
 
 
 lekin nahin, yah is 'intervyuu' kaa tizar tha
 Why Akshay was chosen for this work
 
 
 ? vivek oberoi kyon nahin
 
 
 The Anupam Kher
 
 
 ? koi or vafaadaar
 
 
 The Why none of the three mines
 
 
 ? vah to nishchit rup se behad kaamyaab rahata
 
 
 But why would any of the mines do such 'work'
 
 
 ? ve shaatir hai, jo apane prashansakon ke bich kisi tarah ke vivaad main nahin funsana chahenge, bhale hi paise ko thokar maarani pade
 Yes, Modi ji loves to surprise people, give surprise
 sidhe muqabla karne kii jagah chhipakar kiye gaye hamale unke style ko suut bhi karte hai
 Well, think - Akshay is a very big star, who has also proved loyalty in a good way
 unki pichhali kuch filmein ('pedman', 'gold') dekhie
 They are an excellent example of wrapping political messages in the syrup of entertainment
 jab maine 'toilet - ek prem katha' dekhi, main theme ko chaturaai se pesh karne ke tareeke se impress bhi hui
 At that time i thought, Akshay Kumar has taken advantage of Narendra Modi's Clean India campaign
 sari gandagi se chhutkaaraa paa jaaie
 But today there is more dirt around us than ever before
 kisi ne mujhase poocha, "is intervyuu kaa kya auchity tha
 
 
 ? "good question, but no answer
 
 
 ? koi bhi de sakegaa
 
 
 The It would be praised to call it a 'surgical strike' done in Modi's 'film style' before the judgment day
 jaise-jaise ghisi-pity baaten hoti raheen, ve bematlab kii baton kii taraf badhati chali gayi, or donon hi shaks pradhanmantri awaas ke behad khubasurat bageeche main tahaltey rahe, main sirf itnaa hi soch pai - agar do kharaab abhinayta ek blockbster dene kii koshish karen, jisamen koi nirdeshak nahin he, koi patakatha lekhak nahin he, koi sahaayak abhinayta bhi nahin hai, nateeja to flop hona hi tha
 Leave 'walk the talk', there was nothing to do
 akshay ne mazaakia andaaz main poocha, 'sach
 
 
 You are Gujarati
 
 
 ?' bas, usee vakt maine tivi band kar diya
 Why did Akshay do this? 
 
 ? kyon, akshay, kyon
 
 
 The Akshay proves only one thing, the middle-class actor proves to be useless even as the interviewer
 kya koi sachmuch jaananaa chahta he ki pradhanmantri kii aam ke bare main kya raay he
 
 
 The About fashion
 
 
 ? dhyaan rakhiegaa, maine fishan kaha he, phasism shabd se kanfus na ho jaaiega
 
 
 Okay
 
 
 ? 'khilaadi kumaar' ko bhavishya main taikwando par hi dhyaan dena chahie
 
 
 And the hampers are given, to the groomer of the very beautiful garden of the Prime Minister's House

 The war of words between Narendra Modi and Mulayam Singh Yadav is getting intense
 guuruuvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav ne daawa kiya ki modi jitani bhi mehnat kar len par vah 272 kaa aankada hasil nahin kar paaenge
 In response to this, Modi said at a rally in Etawah on Friday that Netaji should recognize the attitude of the wind
 voting yahi ishaara kar rahe hai ki upie kaa supada saaf hone vaala he or desh main bijepi kii lahar he
 In gestures, Modi said that the bjp's eye is not only on the throne of Delhi, but also on the chair of Lucknow
 narendra modi ne kaha, 'agar janata ko apni jindagi main sudhaar laana he to pehle dilli or iske baad lakhanu kii sarkaar ko badalanaa hoga
 Once liberate Delhi and Lucknow from family
 'rape aropiyon par mulaayam ke vivaadit bayaan par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha, 'jahaan netaa ji ko kathor hona chahie vahaan mulaayam ho jate hai
 If we should be strict against rapists, then Netaji is showing empathy

 Modi also tried to force the Yadav voters of UP
 unhone kaha, 'meraa yaduwanshiyon se purana rishta rahaa he
 You should give us a chance

 The UP government ordered the lions of Gujarat

 India is angry at Pulwama attack, then Pakistan is in the mode of saving terrorists
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha ki agar bharat ne uske khilaaf koi karrwai kii to wo chup nahin baithegaa or naa hi sochega balki jawaab degaa
 But the Pakistan PM forgot that he is facing India, which is far ahead of Pakistan in terms of military power
 bharat kii sainya kshamta ke mukaable pakistani fouj ke paas kuch bhi nahin he
 Now look at these figures which will bring you the truth
 bharat ke paas 13 lakh se zyaada sashastr bal hai
 At the same time, Pakistan has only 6 lakh
 bharat ke paas 13 kor main se teen maarak sena he
 Pakistan has only 2 troops to attack
 bharat ke paas kul 4000 tanks hai jabaki pakistan ke paas kul 2500 tanks hai
 India has 800 fighter aircraft
 jabaki pakistan ke paas 400 ladaaku vimaan hai
 India has 12 airbases adjoining Pakistan
 uske ulat pakistani vayusena ke paas 7 airbase hai
 In other words, the Pakistani Army is far behind our forces
 yani tamaam gustakhiyon ke baad bhi agar pakistan abhi tak vajood main he to uski vajah he bharat kii raksha niti
 Under which India will never attack anyone first
 magar khan sahab iskaa ye matlab bhi nahin he ki aap khyaali pilav hi pakaana shuru kar den
 Elders have said that one should think before speaking
 think bifor you spike
 But Mr
 Khan did not bother to think
 bas bol diya
 But after speaking, when he must have seen this same clip again, he must have been surprised as to what he said in passion
 aisa isliye kyonki pakistan ke upar kul 28 hazaar arab kaa qarj he
 Of this alone, there is a foreign debt of $ 95 billion
 yani sood chukaane ke liye bhi qarz le rahaa he pakistan
 Moreover, every Pakistani has a debt of one lakh 40 thousand rupees
 ab bataaiye ek tihaai yani kareeb saat karod pakistaniyon ke paas khaane ko khaanaa nahin hai
 Four out of every ten Pakistanis do not even have clean water
 or ye bharat ke hamale kaa munh tod jawaab denge
 Well, there is no restriction on dreaming
 magar itnaa to khan sahab se poocha hi ja saktaa he ki sahab aap bharat ke hamale kaa munh tod jawaab dene ke liye paise kahaan se laaenge
 To auction everything haalanki isamen shaq nahin ki parmaanu bamon ke maamle main pakistan hamase zarur kuch aage he
 But Pakistan would have been destroyed by the Indian forces even before that fate came
 magar phir bhi sawaal ye he ki agar bharat-paak ke bich jang chhidati he or ye parmaanu jang main tabdeel hoti he to uske nattejey kya honge
 Twenty million people will be killed in a week

 vanaspatiyon or ped-paudhon kaa nishaan tak mit jayega
 Half the world's two billion people will die of hunger
 duniya kaa ek bada hissaa 'parmaanu sardi' se tabah ho jayega
 It is not just about India or Pakistan
 jang hui to daanv par aadhi duniya hogi
 Yes, if there is a war between India and Pakistan by mistake and in that war, if two countries press the button of only half their atomic bomb, then in India and Pakistan, two crore one million people will be killed in one stroke
 magar iskaa asar naa sirf baaki padosi mulkon balki aadhi duniya ko bhi jhelana padegaa

 lokapal kii maang ko lekar desh ne ek bada andolan dekha he
 a party emerged from the womb of this movement and it also took over the power of Delhi
 bijepi ne bhi vipaksh main rahete samay is andolan ko bharpoor samarthan diya
 The public gave a clear majority and got its government in the center
 is sarkaar ko bane aaj chaar saal puure ho gaye hai lekin desh ko ek lokapal nahin mil sakaa he
 The Lokpal bill, which had been hanging for more than four and a half decades, was passed at the end of 2013
 anna hajaare ke jan andolan or baari jan dabaav ke baad upie sarkaar ne 2013 ke disambar maheene main ise paarit kiya or janvari 2014 main ise raashtrapati kii manjuuri mili thi
 After that the new NDA government came in May
 tabase chaar saal biit gaye, kanoon bhi he, lekin sarkaar ek lokapal kii niyukti nahin kar pai he
 Because of this, questions are also raised on the intention of the government, whether it also wants to appoint Lokpal or not
 isamen saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki, 'lokapal bhrashtachar se judi kisi bhi shikaayat yaa aarope kii jaanch karenge yaa karavaaenge, chaahe vah pradhanmantri se judaa hua maamla kyon na ho
 'recently, the Supreme Court reprimanded the government in this case, after which the Modi government held a meeting to appoint Lokpal in the last March
 lekin nattejey ke naam par abhi kuch nahin he
 Recently Rahul Gandhi also surrounded the government by tweeting the question of not being appointed Lokpal

 com / v9kc2io3ur— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)january 5, 2018lokapal kii niyukti main ek takneekee pechalokapal kii niyukti main ek takneekee pech bhi he
 In fact, according to the guideline given in Lokpal law to the selection committee of Lokpal, in the selection committee, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha will be a distinguished citizen selected by the advice of all
 is baar loksabhaa main kisi ko bhi netaa pratipaksh kaa darja nahin mila he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was stuck at 44, after which the Modi government refused to give the status of leader of opposition to any Congress leader
 niyam ke mutabik loksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaa banane ke liye 54 siten ( loksabhaa ke sadasyon kii kul sankhya kaa das fisadi) hona jaruri he
 If Modi government wanted it, it could have solved this screw long ago
 sivisi (mukhya satarkta adhikari), siaisi (mukhya soochna adhikari) or yahaan tak kii sibiai chif kii niyukti ke liye bhi pehle aisi shart jaruri hoti thi, lekin teenon ke chayan niyam main sanshodhan ho chuke hai or 'netaa pratipaksh' kii jagah 'sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa' likhaa ja chukaa he
 The same can be done for Lokpal
 supreme court kii sakhti27 april 2017 ko supreme court ne lokapal kii niyukti ke maamle main faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki lokapal act par bina sanshodhan ke hi kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Center has no justification as to why the appointment of Lokpal was kept under suspension for so long
 lokapal kii niyukti bina netaa vipaksh ke hi ho sakati he
 The bench had said that it is a practical law and there is no restriction in implementing its provisions
 supreme court kii fatkaar ke baad centre sarkaar ne is saal farvari maah main supreme court ko suchit kiya tha ki bhrashtachar nirodhak sanstha ke liye lokapal kii niyukti kii prakriya jari he or iske liye chayan samiti kii baithak ek march ko hogi
 The committee also includes the Prime Minister
 nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi or nyaayamurti aar bhaanumati kii peeth ko atorni general keke venugopal ne suchit kiya ki lokapal kii niyukti ke liye kadam uthaae gaye hai or is mudde par charchaa ke liye ek march ko pradhanmantri, pradhan nyaayadhish, loksabhaa adhyaksh or vipaksh ke sabase bade dal ke netaa vaali chayan samiti kii baithak hogi
 But the Congress boycotted the meeting to be held on March 1
 congress kii naaraazgiloksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne centre sarkaar ke nimantran ko thukraa diya
 In a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kharge said that an attempt is being made to suppress the voice of the opposition by inviting him as a special invitee to the meeting
 khadge vipaksh ke netaa nahin hai, is vajah se modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main congress ke netaa ko ‘vishesh aamantran’ ke taur par baithak main shaamil hone ke liye bulaayaa tha
 Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, PM Narendra Modi and CJI Deepak Mishra attended this meeting
 khadge ne piem modi ko likhe apane letters main kaha, 'vishesh taur par bheja gaya aamantran sabase jaruri bhrashtachar virdohi nigaraanee samooh kii chayan prakriya se vipaksh kii aawaaj ko baahar karne kaa ek sammilit prayaas he
 In the case of appointment of Lokpal in April 2018, the Supreme Court said that we hope that the government will appoint Lokpal soon
 haalanki, court ne philhal lokapal kii niyukti ko lekar aadesh jari karne se inkaar kar diya he
 On behalf of the Center Attorney General K

 Venugopal said that the process for the appointment of a celebrity is on
 vahiin kaaman coj kii ore se prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar jaan-boojhkar niyukti ko lataka rahi he
 In the last hearing, the Center said that a meeting was held to appoint the Lokpal
 centre ne kaha ki sabase pehle eminent jurist kii niyukti karenge
 The dopt filed its affidavit in the Supreme Court
 1 march kii meeting ke bare main bhi bataaya
 The Congress Party launched an all-out attack after Congress President Rahul Gandhi questioned the delay in the appointment of Lokpal
 congress netaa shakeel ahamed ne ek website se kaha, 'yah gujarat se lekar neerav modi tak bhrashtachar ke sabhi maamalon par pardaa daalane kii sarkaar kii sochi-samajhi koshish he
 When he was in opposition, he wanted immediate implementation of the Lokpal and was even part of the anti-corruption campaign
 ab ve filon par baithe hai

 ye us samay kii baat he jab har chote se bada sangeetkaar lata ko apane sangeet ke liye safalataa kii guarantee maanate the
 OP Nayyar was a deep knowledgeer of homeopathy - Nair Saheb never opted for his music, influenced by the big star and his passion
 unhone us samay ke behtareen actor rajesh khanna, amitabh bachchan, sanjeev kumaar shashi kapur or dharmendra ke liye kabhi gaanon ke liye sangeet nahin diya, baavjood unke gane superhit rahe

 7- He did not think of any personality in front of his rude nature
 aisa hi ek baar unhone sammanit gayak mohammad rafee ke saath bhi kiya
 Due to being late only, he chose another singer to sing the song instead of Rafi

 Meanwhile, a petitioner also presented some pictures of Dwarka's Dallav house before the court, in which there is no visible disposal of garbage

 Within a week, all the Civic Agency has to tell in its report that the cases of malaria, dengue do not increase during the monsoon and how they have taken forward the cleanliness drive to curb them

 But she does not claim that they know these languages
 unka kahana tha ki bhashaaon ko dost banakar siikhaa ja saktaa he, bhay va dabaav unase dur kar diya jaataa he
 Ankita put forward her question and posed some questions that shocked everyone
 unhone vaktavy ke aakiri hisse main sabhi se sawaal kiya ki, 'ham apane gharon main auraton ke pair majboot karen yaa unhen langadi markar giraayen
 We have to decide
 or yahi hamaari niyat ko bhi darshayega
 'gaurav Solanki defined Artificial Intelligence in very clear terms
 unhone kaha, 'rasta poochne ke liye jis tarah insaanon kii jarurat khatm ho rahaa he, usee tarah kahaniyaan likhane ke liye lekhakon kii jarurat khatm na ho jaae

 yah sthiti tab he jab duusare rajyon se mukt hone ke baad anek rashtriya netaaon ne pichley hafte pradesh kaa daura kiya

 But sometimes intensity is not the only problem
 'blue ij da varmust' color process main ekadam alag dhang kii film thi
 Bond is a big film and has its own challenges
 aapane kahin kaha tha ki aap is tathy se nafrat karti hai ki aapane 'blue ij da varmust color' main kaam kiya he, kyon?nahin

 What to say about Monica Belucci? Monica is very cool and sexy
 aapane spector kii script padhi thi?main kahani jaanati thi, sam (mendes) ne mujhe kahani sunai thi lekin mujhe script nahin di gai
 How do you define 'spector' in your career? For me it is more than the film

 Films have been made many times on different issues of 5 stars, and one of them has been re-made on an important topic, called u Va
 yah 'yuva' hi he bas likhane kaa dhang alag sa he
 Although there is no superstar, or big name associated with this film, but whether this film will be able to pull you to the theater, let's review the film to find out: Story: u wa 5 friends Salman, Deenbandhu , Is the story of Vikram, Ram and Anil, who live in Noida, adjoining Delhi and attend school together
 padhai likhaai se dur-dur tak inkaa naata nahin he, phir bhi ghar vaale inkaa admician ek bade or angreji skool main karvaa dete hai
 Then along with their mischief, one such incident happens one night, due to which the lives of all these boys are changed

 In different incidents, they also face police Tejveer Singh (jimmy Shergill) and Judge (parikshit Sahni) and ultimately have to fight for the expenditure of these youth
 script, abhinay:film kaa vishay to purana hi he, lekin use pesh karne kaa dhang bhi kuch nayaa nahin ho paaya he
 The screenplay is quite weak and except for a few characters, the rest is seen acting over
 film kaaphi badi he or pesh karne kaa dhang ise or bhi boring banaata he or ek vakt ke baad aap syrius seen par bhi apni hansi roak nahin pate hai
 In the film, Sanjay Mishra, who became a Hindi teacher, and Mohit Bhaghel in the role of Salman make you laugh at some places, but there are some characters who try their best to make you smile a little, but their attempt is unsuccessful
 tivi ke big bos jaise reality sho vaale sangram singh kaa abhinay ek coach ke rup main kaaphi feekaa sa lagata he or vahiin tanu vaids manu riterns ke raja avasthi urf jimi shergill bhi ikkaa dukka seen main aapako act karte hue najar aate hai
 Many new faces have been given place in the film, which will surely benefit these actors in the upcoming films
 sangeet:film kaa ek bhi geet aisa nahin he, jo aapako apni taraf khinche or film ke dauraan yah gane tarkahin se lagate hai
 Why see: If you are a tremendous fan of the above mentioned actors in this film review, then definitely go to the theater
 kyon naa dekhen:kuch filmein aisi hoti hai, jinhen aap tivi ke remote ko lekar channel badalte vakt tukdon-tukdon main dekh sakate hai or yah usee tarah kii film he

 The Congress has reached the Supreme Court regarding the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat
 congress ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar do siton ke liye jari chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ko chunauti di he
 There has been a demand for simultaneous elections on the seats vacated by Amit Shah and Smriti Irani
 gujarat congress ne rajya kii do rajyasabha siton par alag-alag upachunaav karaane ke chunaav ayog ke faisle ko "asanvaidhanik" qaraar dete hue aarope lagaaya he ki sattarudh bijepi chunaav ayog par dabaav bana rahi he taaki vah donon siten jeet sake
 The petition said that conducting separate elections on both the seats on the same day is unconstitutional and against the spirit of the Constitution
 gujarat se rajyasabha main khaali hui do siton par paanch july ko chunaav honge
 According to the notification of the Regional Election Commission, Amit Shah got the certificate of winning the Lok Sabha elections on May 23, while Smriti Irani got it on May 24
 isse donon ke chunaav main ek din kaa antar ho gaya
 On this basis, the Commission has considered the two seats of the state separately, but elections will be held on the same day
 aisa hone se ab donon siton par bijepi ko jeet mil jaaegi, kyonki vahaan pratham variyata vot nae sire se tay honge
 If elections were held simultaneously, the Congress would get a seat
 sankhya bal ke hisaab se gujarat main rajyasabha kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye ummidavaar ko 61 vot chahie
 An election on the same ballot will allow a candidate to cast the same vote
 is sthiti main congress ek seat aasaani se nikaal leti kyonki uske paas 71 vidhayak hai
 But according to the Election Commission notification, mlas will vote separately
 aise main unhen do baar vot karne kaa mauka milegaa
 In this way, BJP mlas, whose number is more than 100, can win both the candidates by voting twice

 Center vs State on Motor Vehicle Act, many states have cut the challan amount
 Many states ruled by BJP are also included in this list, crossing the red light on the road or driving a two-wheeler without a helmet has been common on Indian roads for some time
 
 isi dharna ko badalane ke liye kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kaa mantralay trephic niyam todane par baari jurmaana lagane kii niti laayaa
 On 1 September, the law came into force and by 11 September its jugaad was also out
 bhaajapa shasit rajyon samet kai rajya sarkaron ne is kanoon ko lagu karne se inkaar kar diya yaa phir jurmaane kii raashi aadhi kar di
 The overwhelming majority government of Bharatiya Janata Party talking about one country one legislation could not implement the law passed by the Center from its own state governments
 abhi tak kin rajyon ne chaalaan kii jurmaana raashi ko kam kiya he, unki list yahaan he
 
 
 1
 gujaratpradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah ke grih rajya gujarat ne sabase pehle is niyam ke chhutkaare kaa tarika apanaaya
 State Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced huge discounts on several fines
 gujarat sarkaar ne ausatan 90 fisadi kii katautee kii he
 Like, 1 thousand instead of 10 thousand for stopping the ambulance route, Rs 100 instead of 1 thousand on the overload on the bike, a fine of only one thousand rupees instead of 5 thousand on the bike without registration
 2
 Maharashtra: Another bjp-ruled state of Maharashtra has also stood up to this law
 maharashtra kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari kaa grih rajya bhi he
 It is also worth noting that elections are going to be held in Maharashtra in a few months, in such a situation, the head of state Devendra Fadnavis does not want to take any risk
 maharashtra ke parivahan mantri is mudde par nitin gadakari ko chitthee bhi likhane vaale hai
 3
 uttarakhandbhajapa shasit rajya uttarakhand ne bhi jurmaana raashi ko kaaphi zyada bataaya
 Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat amended the new Motor Vehicle Act in the state and reduced the amount of many fines
 udhaaharan ke taur par bina license ke gaadi chalaane par 5000 kii jagah 2500 rupee kaa jurmaana
 4
 jharkhandamaharashtra kii tarah hi kuch maheenon main jharkhand main bhi chunaav hone vaale hai or yahaan par bhi voton kii chintaa he
 The new Motor Vehicle Act has not been implemented in the state as well and the state government has already indicated the reduction in the fine
 guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke daure ke baad jharkhand main jurmaana raashi main katautee ho sakati he
 5
 haryanise saal haryana main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or rajya ke mukhiya manohar laal khatter ne abhi nayaa motor whical act lagu karne se inkaar kiya he
 a conscious campaign will be launched by the state government for traffic rules throughout Haryana
 rajya sarkaar 45 dinon tak ye abhiyaan chalaaegi
 Apart from these important states, some other states like West Bengal, Karnataka have also opened their front against the Motor Vehicle Act
 trinmul congress ne is kanoon kaa sansad main bhi virodh kiya tha or ab mamata sarkaar ne rajya main ise lagu nahin kiya he
 At the same time, the state government of bjp-ruled Karnataka is also troubled by the increased penalty amount and has indicated that the penalty amount will be cut soon
 aapako bataa den ki agar kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kii baat karen to unka kahana he ki centre kii taraf ye jurmaana kamai ke liye nahin balki logon kii suraksha ke liye lagaaya gaya he
 If the law is strict then people will follow it
 haalanki, rajya sarkaron ke dwaara jo kanoon main badlaav kiya ja rahaa he usapar nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki rajyon ke paas apane hisaab se badlaav karne kaa adhikaar he, lekin unhone ye bhi apil kii he ki kisi rajya sarkaar ko raajnneetik dabaav main nahin aana chahie or kanoon ko kadaa hi rakhana chahie
 The Supreme Court has refused to stay the state government's decision to provide reservation to the Maratha community in Maharashtra
 supreme court ne kaha ki ye aarakshan restropective prabhaav se lagu nahin hoga
 However, notice has also been issued for an interim stay
 maamle kii sunwaayee 2 hafte baad hogi
 Let us tell you that an NGO filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court order upholding 16 per cent reservation for Maratha community in education and government jobs in Maharashtra
 yachika main kaha gaya he samvidhan peeth dwaara tay aarakshan par 50 fisadi cap kaa ulanghan hua he
 a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Anirudh Bose has heard the issue
 gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ‘youth for ikvality' ke pratinidhi sanjit shukla ne yah yachika daayar kii he
 The petition states that the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Reservation Act provides 12 to 13 percent reservation for Maratha community in education and government jobs respectively
 yah sheersh adaalat ke indira saahani maamle main die faisle main tay kii gai 50 pratishat aarakshan seemaa kaa ulanghan he, jise ‘‘mandal faisla'' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Maharashtra government also filed a counterclaim in the Supreme Court, hoping to challenge the decision passed by the High Court, saying that it passed an order on any petition challenging the June 27 decision of the High Court without hearing the state's side
 Do not be done
 bif vivaad par mache ghamaasan ke bich pidipi adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne bada bayaan diya he
 Sirmaur of the party, which has been in power in Jammu and Kashmir, said that no one should object to whatever people eat inside their house if feelings are not hurting
 mahabuuba ne kaha, 'agar dusron kibhaavnaaen aahat nahin horhi hai to logon ko apane ghar ke andar kuch bhi khaane kaa adhikaar he
 Some people are trying to take the law into their own hands
 'pidipi adhyaksh ne kaha ki logon ko is masale par vichaar karnaa chahie ki vikaas ke liye kya kuch kiya jaae
 In case of any kind of bullying, strict action should be taken in the country
 gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir main bif ko lekarsiyaasi galiyaronse lekar aam sadakon par jamkar bavaal machaa hua he
 While the High Court has banned the sale of beef, the Supreme Court has suspended this order for two months

 nae saal kii purv sandhya par ‘aadhyatmik raajnneeti’ ke madhyam se logon ke saath judane kaa faisla karne vaale tamil superstar rajnikant chupchaap apane fain club rajani makkal mandram (aaramem) ko nae sire se chaak-chauband kar rahe hai
 The motive is to launch a comprehensive social media campaign before delivering on its promises to reach every street and township in Tamil Nadu
 rajya kii raajnneeti main utarane vaale pehle ke sine abhinaytaon se alag rajnikant fain club ke log pehle se hi aaramem ke binar tale utsaahi samarthakon ko sangathit karne main jute hue hai
 It is expected that they will field candidates from all the 234 assembly constituencies in the 2021 assembly elections
 rajani aakhri siyaasi hamalaa bolne se pehle sthaneey samoohon ko khud ke agua pratinidhiyon kii parishad chunane ke liye protsaahit kar rahe hai
 Enthusiastic activists of the RMM have also drawn up more than half of the blueprint in rural and urban constituencies of the state
 abhiyaan puraa hone se do maheene pehle hi unhone kareeb 21,00,000 nae sadsy bana liye hai
 Ten member committees have already been formed in the district councils and about 65,000 branch secretaries have been shortlisted
 har shakha samiti main 30 sadsy honge, jo 1-1 matdaan centre sanbhaalenge
 Realizing the void of leadership in the main Dravidian parties — the ruling AIADMK and its adversary DMK — Rajinikanth and his supporters hope that they will wrest a large number of supporters of these parties until the party is formally announced in the coming years
 Will be able to get aaramem ke rajya sachiv banaae gaye film nirmaataa raju mahalingam kehete hai, ‘‘puure rajya main log, khaskar mahilaayein or yuva is karishmai netaa ko mukchaymantri ke rup main dekhte hai
 "he is confident that" Talivars will prove to be a tool to change the fate of Tamil people

 Gurumurthy has endorsed the superstar's brand of spiritual politics
 ve maanate hai ki isse puraa khel badal saktaa he, jo dravidavaadi, hindu virdohi line se alag he or purana pad chukaa he
 Significantly, the rmm's strategy in Tamil Nadu — organization building and appointment of booth level committees — seems to be a duplicate of the bjp's successful campaign in Uttar Pradesh in 2014 and 2017
 haalanki rajnikant is dharna ko khatm karne par utaaru dikhte hai ki unke peeche bhaajapa he
 After a month of exposing his political aspirations, he reformed the RMM symbol to bring out the lotus and the snake
 unke samarthak kehete hai, unke brands vaali ‘aadhyatmik raajnneeti’ gaiyr-hinduon ko alag nahin karti, yah usee ko pakkaa karne kii koshish thi
 It is clear that superstar Rajinikanth does not want any kind of hurdle in his journey from a political opinion maker in Tamil Nadu to a political challenger

 raajnneetik matbhedon ko desh ke baahar nahin dikhaanaa chahie
 The party should keep its voice, but it is their right to keep the party's voice within the country
 aalochana karne kaa adhikaar he, lekin desh ke baahar jaakar aisi baaten nahin kerani chahie
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that on one side the conference of overseas Indians is going on in Delhi and the Prime Minister is talking about how to improve the world relations with India, but on the other side Rahul Gandhi talks about hatred, hatred
 rahul kaa bayaan nindaneey he, aalochana ke yogya he
 It is not right to accuse our government of hatred
 ravishankar prasad ne rahul gandhi se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki teen talaak par kya congress kaa stand pyaar vaala tha yaa nafrat vaala tha, yah un ko spasht karnaa chahie
 Congress Party Rahul Gandhi cannot take a stand for women's dignity justice
 loksabhaa main unhone ek stand liya, rajyasabha main doosraa stand liya or rahul gandhi hamaari party ko paath padhaa rahe hai
 This is not right
 yah congress ke dohare maapdand he
 Political votes are influenced by the bank
 bahrain main jaakar hamako padesh de rahe hai
 bjp's strong criticism of this statement of Rahul
 ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ne isse pehle bhi kai baar galat baaten kii he
 Rahul Gandhi has also done politics of promoting casteism in Congress, Gujarat
 ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki congress ne samudaay kii raajnneeti hameshaa se kii he
 The Congress has not changed the appeasement attitude of the Congress from Shahbano to Shaira Bano
 koun nafrat kii raajnneeti kar rahaa he, yah saaf pataa chalata he
 Condemning Rahul's statement on China, Ravi Shankar Prasad also said that Rahul Gandhi's love for China also raises interesting questions

 As soon as the month of April arrives in India, the heat has started speaking and now it is going to be difficult to operate with only a fan
 aise main agar aap nayaa AC kharidne ke bare main soch rahe hai to gam aapako yahaan kuch jaruri tips bataa rahe hai jo aapaki madad kar saktaa he, sahi AC chunane main
 -the first thing that you have to keep in mind is that you buy better energy efficient AC
 jitani zyada AC kii reating rahegi utani hi wo bijli bachaayegaa
 Because you must know that by applying AC, electricity bill comes very high
 aamtaur par asi 1 star se lekar 5 star reating ke saath aate hai
 That is, AC with 5 star rating will be better than 3 star one
 haalanki isamen ye baat dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki agar aap asi ko keval 6-7 ghante yuj karnaa chaahate hai wo bhi keval 3-4 maheene ke liye to aise main 3 star reating vaala AC phydemand sabit ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, you can also select the inverter AC to save power
 ye bijli zyada behatar tareeke se bachaata he
 That is, you can think of it as a 3-star inverter AC that consumes less power than a 5-star regular AC
 lekin dhyaan rahe regular asi kii tulana main inwarter asi zyada mahange hote hai
 After this, the thing that you have to keep in mind is the size of the AC
 agar aapkaa room 100 se lekar 120 squaire feet main he to 1 ton kaa AC aapke liye paryaapt he
 For a room of 175 square feet, you need 1
 5 ton ke asi kii jarurat padegi
 Similarly, choose AC
 sahi sies kaa AC lenaa bhi aapaki bijli bachaayegaa
 -you must also take care of coils while buying AC
 AC aamtaur par do coiles- copper or aluminium ke saath aate hai
 acs with copper coils are a bit expensive, but they are better in quality than aluminum
 isi tarah aap asi kharidte vakt extream hit yaa jab surya kii raushnee sidhe asi par pad rahi ho aise condishan ke liye asi kii effishiency ke bare main bhi jarur puuchhen
 Because good quality acs perform better even in extreme heat, while lower quality acs perform poorly as well as consume more power
 -in sabake alaava is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana he ki asi kahin zyada nois naa paidaa kare
 Split acs usually produce less or no noise, whereas window acs have more noise problems
 ye aapaki neend kharaab kar saktaa he
 In this case, ask your AC dealer about the noise details of indoor and outdoor units, it is in db
 saath hi AC ko lagaae jane vaali jagah bhi dhyaan rakhen
 -if you want more than cooling the AC, with extras feature, nowadays the market also comes with air purifiers, anti-bacterial, order removal filters and AC with wi-fi support
 haalanki inaki keemat thodi zyada hoti he
 - Finally, the thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to take care of the after sale service too
 AC kaaphi technology ke aate hai
 In this case, get all the information related to servicing from your dealer

 After the Punjab and Goa assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal are now eyeing Gujarat and that is why the Aam Aadmi Party has sent its core team to Gujarat for Kejriwal's most important mission, Gujarat
 party ke chaar bade netaaon kii kor team gujarat main deraa daal chuki he
 Who is in this core team of Kejriwal? In this core team of Arvind Kejriwal, there is big party leader Sanjay Singh who is close to Kejriwal and has played an important role in Punjab elections
 vahiin duusare netaa hai ashutosh jo dilli ke saath goa vidhansabha chunaav main mukhya bhoomika main the
 The third leader of the team is Ashish Khaitan, a former investigative journalist and head of the Delhi Dialogue Commission in the party's Delhi government
 khetaan ne punjab or dilli main party kaa ghoshnaa patr taiyaar kiya tha or is kor team ke chauthe netaa hai durgesh pathak jinhone dilli chunaav ke saath punjab chunaav main party ke liye behad ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Durgesh Pathak is also the party's national organization incharge
 gujarat main kya karegi aap kii kor team?kejariwal kii is sabase bharosemand kor team ko gujarat chunaav main ahm jimmedaari di gai he
 The four leaders will divide Gujarat into four zones and take responsibility of one zone each, where the party's organization will have full strength in the Gujarat assembly elections to be held in December, by coordinating with the cadres from the booth level
 philhal sabhi netaa 26 march ko gandhinagar main hone vaale arvind kejariwal kii jansabha kii taiyaari ke liye gujarat main hai
 But according to sources, after the results of Punjab, full time duty of these leaders will be in Gujarat
 party ke ye netaa gujarat main hi chunaav khatm hone tak rahenge
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party has given the responsibility of making Gopal Rai, a minister in the Delhi government, an organization in Gujarat
 gopal raay ke saath kumaar vishwaas bhi gujarat main zyada samay bithaayenge
 If sources are to be believed, all the big leaders and ministers of the party will give time in Gujarat after the results of Punjab, but all the plans are also dependent on the results of the Punjab assembly elections
 agar punjab main janamat aam aadmi party ke paksh main aata he, to jaahir he party kaa manobal badhegaa or gujarat main unhen iskaa phayda mil saktaa he, lekin agar punjab main aap ko safalataa nahin mili, to gujarat main bhi kejariwal ke sapanom ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 These days, the International Film Festival of India is going on in Goa
 buudhvaar se 50wein international kii shuruyaat hui he
 The first day was attended by actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth
 isi dauraan shuukravaar ko IFFI kii website ne badi chook kar di
 Actually, one of the most famous directors of the bygone era Satyajit Ray was written in the website
 magar intro ke saath photo main diarector kii jagah mashhoor geetkaar gulzaar kii photo lagi thi
 After this, correction was done on the site when the mistake was realized

 French actress Isabelle Huppert was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award
 bataa den ki is baar festival main 26 feechar film or 15 non feechar film kii screening karne kii yojana he
 Many films of Amitabh Bachchan are also being screened during the festival
 isapar amitabh ne kaha- hamaare paas aabhaar vyakt karne ke liye koi shabd nahin hai
 Let me tell you that during this time Amitabh Bachchan was also awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award
 film industry main 50 saal puure karne par amitabh ne kaha- mere filmi safar ke 50 saal puure ho chuke hai
 Since 1969, i started working in films and this 50th edition of IFFI is also going on
 main sarkaar kaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum ki unhone iskaa aayojan kiya
 i remember clearly that when in childhood i used to read about the freedom movement, i felt unlucky
 mujhe hairat hua karti thi ki main aazaadee ke andolan ke vakt kyon paidaa nahin hua
 i was born in a very different world
 main jaanata tha ki main achhut hum
 And would have been struggling to forget this thing about himself
 main ise andekha karata
 i would try to change it, thinking, maybe changing the name would change it
 magar log mujhe lagaataar yaad dilaate rahete
 Reminding me that i am untouchable in many ways
 tabhi maine jaan liya ki jo aazaadee hamane hasil kii he, vah mahaj siyaasi aazaadee he
 Apart from this, there are many more personal freedoms for which we have to fight
 mujhe ehsaas hua ki aazaadee ke andolan kii viraasat main koi cheez gaayab he
 That is the legacy of women, dalits and tribals
 ve bhi aazaadee ke liye lade the, magar unki koshishon ko darj nahin kiya gaya
 Today we represent them all
 sir par mailaa dhone kii pratha beshak is puure daur main maujuud thi
 It continued under the throne of many rulers of India
 yah aazaadee ke baad bhi jari rahi
 It still exists today
 yah aazaadee nahin ho sakati
 It must end
 aam taur par do tarah kii awaajen or daleelein hai jinhen log sir par mailaa dhone kaa kaam kar rahi safai karmchaaree mahilaon main takat ke saath aage badhaate hai
 One of them is, "didi you do such a good job, if you don't, who else will?" This is to glorify them
 yahi vah cheez he jo mahatma gandhi ne kii thi or jise narendra modi kaayam rakhana chaahate hai
 The need is to close it
 duusari he, ''didi, ham samajhate hai ki aapako yah kaam nahin karnaa chahie, lekin agar yah nahin karengi to aap kaise jiengi? aapkaa guzaara isi se hota he
 "it's ruthless
" hamane unki paidaaish or guzar-basar kii ek package deal kar rakhi he
 But this is the reality that people keep on beating and manipulating and scavenging on their heads in front of them
 unke tareeke ye hote hai, ''didi, agar aap nahin karengi to mere liye safai koun karegaa?'' yah bahut hi suniyojit chaal he
 The problem is that we are neither recognizing nor accepting the things that hold us hostage
 yah sirf daliton yaa achhuton kii aazaadee kii baat nahin he
 If you think that i am lower than you, you are a slave
 jati sabase badi bimariyon main se ek he
 The patriarchal system is another virus that we never accept
 is maamle main babasaheb ambedkar ne do bahut hi ahm kadam uthaae the
 The first is Article 17 of the Constitution, which makes untouchability illegal
 magar iske liye hamen vyaavhaarik hastkshep kii jarurat thi
 The second is the Hindu Code Bill
 unhen istipha isliye dena padaa kyonki ise manjuur nahin kiya gaya
 Today Ambedkar has been made a big symbol
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ki ve bhi ambedkar bhakt hai
 But what was Ambedkar's vision? Why don't you start implementing it? a racist mind is a virus that no government has the courage to deal with
 pitrusatta ke saath bhi yahi baat he
 Our aim on August 15 should be to eliminate these diseases from the root
