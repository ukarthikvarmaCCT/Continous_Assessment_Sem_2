 yah krur baat he, lekin isse kinaaraa karnaa mumkin nahin
 -standhal (french writer) Can we move away from politics? Although politics is not as beautiful as poetry, it does not have the rhythm of music, nor the smell of colors, but between music and colors it is present with all its ferocity

 Naipaul's western precursor spectacles, so of course this book is not for him
 yah unke liye he, jo prism ke har kone ko dekhne kii kuwwat rakhte hai, jo kisi ek ke saath nahin hai, lekin sabake saath hai
 So when the 1952-born Nobel-winning writer Orhan Pamuk's new novel Snow came out in the Turkish capital of Istanbul in 2004, the world as well as the east was a bit shocked
 iske pehle naypaul apane tareeke se east banaam west ko vyakhyayit karte rahe the or edward said ke orientlysm ko pachaane kii takat europe ke kuch secular inteleccoals tak hi simit thi
 Snow was actually a political discourse even though it was a novel
 ab snow kaa hindi anuwaad prakashit hua he or ek baar phir east or west kaa saanskrithik sangharsh or saare rajnatik sawaal bahes ke centre main hai
 Snow is the story of a poet, A, who returned to his country Turkey after spending 12 years in exile in Germany
 arminia kii seemaa se sate turki ke sudur purvi praant cars main kuch samay se ladakiyon kii aatmahatya kii ghatnaayen bad gai hai
 There has been a war between secular and hardcore forces
 european union main shaamil hone kii mahatvakanksha main turki kaa ek bada varg european hona chahta he or ek varg islamic saanskrithik pahchaan kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 As a journalist 'A' aims to investigate the causes of suicide and meet the girl he once loved
 ‘k’ khud ko secular maanata he, jo nasl, dharm or mulk kii pahchaan se upar he
 But in Europe, he is a person from the backward Islamic world and in Turkey, English-born Europeans
 angrejidan european hone ke paimaane saaf hai-teesri duniya ko na sirf garib, kamjor or nirih, balki saanskrithik rup se pichhadaa hua samajhnaa
 The discovery of 'A' takes him to Blue, the arch-islamic leader of Kars who is living in communal tension
 blue kamaal ataturk or europe kaa virdohi he
 He did not shy away from modernism, but modernism has come through Europe, avoiding it
 snow ke pehle yah samajhakaa thodaa jatil tha ki kattar or secular takaton kii ladaai main itane pech bhi mumkin hai
 Blue argues — there is no denying that Europe is intellectually and culturally advanced, modern
 or yah aadhuniktaa unhen thali main sajaakar bhi nahin mili

 Hijab is prohibited in government institutions in Turkey, but Blue's girlfriend wears a hijab

 When we think that everything is going to be alright in his life, then he is killed at the hands of a radical Islamic leader at a crossroads in Germany
 is netaa ke liye vah europe kaa pitthu tha or europe ke liye sirf ek musalmaan
 In the most gentle emotion of snow love, there is a story of cultural identity and inter-conflict of Gunthi East and West
 yah paamuk kii takat thi, jo europe main sweekaarya hone ke liye unhen naypaul hone kii jarurat nahin padi
 West may or may not like them, but cannot ignore them
 jaisaa ki paamuk ne kaha tha, “out of west hone kaa matlab he, ek aisi duniya se taalluk rakhana, jo west kii tarah amir nahin he, ek aisi bhashaa main likhnaa, jo angreji nahin he, isliye taqatvar kii bhashaa nahin he, aise samaaj se aana, jo hameshaa pashchim ke aadhipaty se aakraant rahaa ho

 kolkata ke NRS aspataal main ek doctor par hue hamale ke virodh main doctoron ne hadtaal kii
 In support of these doctors of West Bengal, other doctors from many parts of the country also took to the streets and went on strike
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se baatcheet ke baad doctoron ne apni harlaat waapas le lee he
 But the Supreme Court has said in many of its decisions that medical officers and government hospitals are 'bound by the duty' to save human life
 isse sambandhit maamalon main sheersh court pehle kai faisle de chukaa he
 In a May 1996 case, the apex court held that the failure to provide medical assistance violated the fundamental right to life guarantee under Article 21 of the Constitution
 supreme court to yahaan tak kah chukaa he ki privet doctor bhi kisi ke ilaaj se inkaar nahin kar sakate hai
 There have been several cases in which doctors violate their professional vows
 pashchim bengal kii haalia ghatnakram ke sandarbh main hi sanyog se supreme court ke 6 may 1996 ko pashchim bengal khet majdoor samiti banaam pashchim bengal sarkaar ke ek maamle ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In this, the apex court had said that the first duty of the government is to secure the welfare of the people
 supreme court kahata he ki, ‘logon ko paryaapt medical suvidha muhaiyaa karana rajya ke kalyankari dayitvon kaa ahm hissaa he
 The government operates its hospitals and health centers and performs its duties and provides medical facilities to those who demand it
 ’kya kahata he samvidhanshirsh court ke 1996 ke us faisle ke mutabik, ‘samvidhan kaa anuchhed 21 rajya ko prayek vyakti ke jivan kii raksha ke adhikaar ke daayitv se las karata he
 Protection of human life is thus paramount
 rajya sanchalit sarkari aspataal or usamen karyrat medical afasar maanav jivan ke sangrakshan kii khatir chikitsa sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane ko lekar baadhya hai
 If a government hospital fails to provide timely treatment to a needy person, it is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution to guarantee the right to life of every person
 ’kar sakate hai court kii avmaananaa kaa kesasupreme court main vakil santosh kumaar isi cese kii binah par bataate hai ki supreme court ke is faisle kaa matlab he ki koi bhi peedit naagarik supreme court yaa hai court ke adeshon ke sahare doctoron kii hadtaal ko chunauti de saktaa he or court kii avmaananaa kaa cese daayar bhi kar saktaa he
 It was only on the petition of the West Bengal Khet Mazdoor Samiti that the Supreme Court ruled that several government hospitals in Bengal refused to treat them after a laborer named Hakeem Sheikh fell from the train
 yahaan tak ki sarkari aspataalon ne nijee aspataal main ilaaj ke liye un par dabaav bhi daalaa
 The Supreme Court observed that, 'officials of government hospitals violated the guarantee of the right to life of Hakeem Sheikh under Article 21 of the Constitution
 ’ court ne kaha, ‘rajya hakim shaikh ko mili sanvaidhanik adhikaar ko dene se inkaar nahin kar saktaa he
 'at that time the apex court ruled that, in relation to the denial of constitutional rights guaranteed under Part Three of the Constitution, it is decided that through redress under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (enforcement of Fundamental Rights) Adequate compensation may be awarded by the court for such violations
 bataa den ki supreme court ke nirdesh par maamle main tahakikat ke liye pashchim bengal sarkaar ne kalakatta hai court ke ritred jaj justise lilamoy ghosh ke netritv main ek jaanch samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 Following the committee's report, the then state government had issued a number of directives for hospitals
 ilaaj karnaa peshewar daayitvabaharhaal, isi tarah ek duusare maamle main supreme court kaa kahana he ki samvidhan kaa anuchhed 21 rajya ko jivan kii suraksha kaa daayitv pradaan karata he
 According to the court, 'every doctor, whether he is in government or private practice, has a professional responsibility to protect human life through his expertise
 koi bhi kanoon yaa rajya chikitsa peshey se jude sadasyon ko apane medical pesh ke dayitvon ke nirvahan main hastkshep nahin kar saktaa he
 The obligation is absolute and paramount
 kanoon agar usamen hastkshep karata he to use barkaraar nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, doctors should be allowed to perform their professional duties

 The 50-share Nifty crossed 7,000
 is saal ke shuruyaat main kabhi aisa nahin laga tha ki share bazaar is tarah se chalaang lagayegaa
 It had become very sluggish due to a weakening economy, dwindling exports, rising unemployment, lack of enthusiasm among investors, and many other reasons, but during the election campaign, it started taking fast steps which has now turned into a leap
 isane ab ek ke baad ek nae kirtiman banane shuru kar die
 On this rise of the market, many times it was also suspected that speculators have a big hand in it because while the Sensex and Nifty were running up, there was no increase in many stocks
 yah hairaan kar dene vaali baat thi kyonki share bazaar main jab jashn manata he to usamen sabhi shaamil hote hai
 There is some merit in this because the shares of many important companies did not grow much compared to the overall rise in the market
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan he desh kii sabase badi privet company reliance industries jiske share ek maheene tak vahiin ke vahiin rahe
 It would have been understandable if this increase had taken place equally

 Whenever they feel that there is no use in this, then they go out together and the market becomes anxious around all four
 aisa bharat sahit kai deshon main hua he
 Nobody has foreign money, he comes for his own selfish purpose
 baharhaal is baat main to koi shaq nahin he ki desh main ek yogya agali sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna se yahanshare bazaar uchhal rahe hai
 After going through a period of despair for a long time, the market has finally gone into a boom phase
 vah ashanvit he or vahaan ke khilaadiyon ko lag rahaa he ki nai sarkaar kaarobaar or vdhapar ko badhaava degi
 He also feels that the new government will bring stability in the country which is necessary for business

 Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley are sitting on the single seat of the couch
 narendra modi or nitin gadakari dabl seat vaale sofe par
 a file is seen on the right hand side of Jaitley
 aisi hi ek file modi ke bagal main rakhi he
 On the front center table, Modi, Rajnath and Jaitley are seen holding diaries and pens to take notes
 jabaki gadakari ke saamne pile rang ke do lipaphe ek ke upar ek rakhe hai
 The top is open
 said teble par guladasta rakhaa he, jise shaayad thodi der pehle modi ko diya gaya hoga
 Sushma Swaraj was also supposed to be in these pictures
 lekin unhen apane chunaav kshetra main janaa tha
 So Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari met him in Delhi before this meeting
 sushamaa ko milakar modi, jetali, rajnath singh or gadakari, agar inhen agali modi sarkaar kaa kor group kahen, to zyaada sahi hoga
 If these pictures are matched with the pictures of the meeting held at 7, Race Course Road before the results of the Lok Sabha elections 10 years ago, then the changed BJP will be visible
 tab kii tasveeron main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath laalkrishna adwani, jaswant singh, murali manohar joshi or pramod mahajan dikhenge
 In 10 years, a lot of water flowed into the Yamuna

 Rather, the change in the BJP in the last 10 years may not have happened since May 16
 is badlaav kii neenv pichley saal 13 sitambar ko rakh di gai thi, jab bijepi ke sansadeey board ne narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha
 Since then, the hard work, dedication and commitment with which Modi has raised the party's flag across the country, it is difficult to find an example
 is loksabhaa chunaav main sirf ek hi mudda tha narendra modi
 And if the BJP wins, then only its head will be tied
 par ab agar sarkaar banani he, to zaahir he sabko saath lekar kaam karnaa hoga
 It is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to have someone in the Cabinet and not to whom
 bijepi upie par satta ke do centre hone ke aarope lagaati rahi he or kahati rahi he ki sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri karyaalay kii garima ko kam kiya
 In such a situation, it is not possible to speculate that senior BJP or RSS leaders can impose their choice on Modi
 yah yaad rakhana jaruri he ki aresas ke inkaar karne ke baavjood atal bihari vaajapeyi ne jaswant singh ko vitt mantralay kii zimmedaari di thi
 But for Modi, it would be hard to decide the role for veteran leaders like LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi
 aresas chahta tha ki ye donon hi netaa loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladane ke bajaae rajyasabha main jaaen
 But both of them flatly refused
 balki modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane se bhi ye donon netaa khush nahin the
 Advani was more annoyed with how someone else could be made a PM candidate during his tenure
 ab phir vahi sawaal saamne aayaa he
 Did Advani and Joshi contest elections because they wanted to become ministers in the Modi government? If not, what will be their role in a possible government
 adwani ke kareebi ishaara kar chuke hai ki adwani modi sarkaar main shaamil nahin hona chaahate, magar loksabhaa adhyaksh jaisaa sanvaidhanik pad lene se unhen gurej nahin
 At the same time it is certain that Joshi will also not remain in the government
 adwani ko lekar ek duvidha yah bhi he ki philhal vah endie ke kaaryakari adhyaksh or bijepi sansadeey dal ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 As long as the BJP was in opposition and it was not decided who was the top leader in the party, Advani did not face any problem in holding both these posts
 lekin agar modi pradhanmantri banate hai or adwani in donon padon par bane rahete hai, to phir se modi ke adhikaron par chunauti uthne kaa khatra barkaraar rahegaa
 Especially when Advani has been expressing his unhappiness over Modi from time to time
 bataur pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi endie ke adhyaksh the or sansadeey dal ke netaa bhi
 There is no reason why Narendra Modi as Prime Minister should not get these two posts
 jabaki spikar jaise sanvaidhanik pad par kabiz hone ke baad adwani sarkaar or party ke andruni kaamkaaj main na to koi dakhal de paaenge or na hi aisa karnaa us sanvaidhanik pad kii garima ke anukool hoga
 The position of the speaker is also very sensitive
 khaskar gathbandhan kii sarkaar main
 In 1998, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government fell by just one vote
 tab tidipi ke jiemasi balyogi spikar the or unhone urisa ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri giridhar gamang ko vot dene kii ijazat de di thi
 In politics, Advani took the first position as the speaker
 dilli kii metropolitan concil main
 Now he wants the same position at the last stage of his career
 par is baar loksabhaa kaa
 Will have to see what the party decides
 dilli sthit jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity ke ek chaatr ankit kumaar raay ne laapata chal rahe najeeb kii maa sahit aath logon ke khilaaf vasant kunj thane main shikaayat darj karai

 Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has started its preparations for Chandrayaan-3
 lekin isamen kam se kam teen saal kaa samay lagegaa
 Trusted sources of ISRO said that it is almost impossible to launch Chandrayaan-3 by next year
 kyonki, iske lander, rover, rocket or pelods ko taiyaar karne main kam se kam teen saal kaa samay to lagegaa hi
 There are reports in the media that Chandrayaan-2 can be launched by November-2020
 Aajtak
 in On 12 September 2019, what was the Chandrayaan-3 mission like? Aajtak, a highly placed source at isro's Ahmedabad center
 in ko bataaya ki kisi bhi nae pelod yani upkaran ko jarurat ke hisaab se banane ke liye kam se kam teen saal kii research hoti he
 After this, his design is made
 phir shuru hota he deveopment kaa kaam
 If you use the pre-made payload also, it will take at least 6 months to rebuild and develop
 maan le ki chandrayan-3 ke lander main chaar or rover main 2 puraane pelod bhi lagaate hai to in sabko banaakar viksit karne main kareeb 2 saal lagenge
 After this, it takes about 8 months to a year to integrate all these payloads
 iske baad lander, rover ko integrat kiya jaataa he
 But they cannot be sent into space without an orbiter
 isliye orbitor bhi bananaa padegaa
 It may be that no experimental device is placed in the orbiter
 uskaa upyog sirf ek rocket kii tarah ho
 It may also be that a payload has to be purchased from a private company or from abroad
 aise main or samay lagegaa
 What kind of reward? Prior to Chandrayaan-2, the government may have cut off ISRO scientists if any committee of ISRO has recommended Chandrayaan-3
 lekin is sifarish ko isro pehle vigyaan mantralay, vitt mantralay or piemo bhejtaa he
 Allotment of money for the mission takes place after getting permission from all places
 iske baad shuru hota he mishan ko aage badhaane kaa kaam
 Even then, all these will take around 3 to 4 years in total
 tab kahin jaakar chandrayan-3 mishan kii lonching hogi
 Even if Chandrayaan-3 uses Chandrayaan-2's orbiter, it will also take time to build lander, rover, rocket (PSLV or GSLV)
 isliye chandrayan-3 mishan itani jaldi sambhav nahin
 Because, the data of Chandrayaan-2 is still being analyzed
 gauratlab he ki chandrayan-2 kaa orbitor saat saalon tak kaam karegaa
 So ISRO still has a lot of time to send Chandrayaan-3 mission back to the moon
 98% safal chandrayan 2- isro chif ke daawey par desh ke vaigyanikon ne hi uthaae sawalho saktaa he chandrayan-3 prithvi or chand ke kam chakkar lagaaeye sambhav he ki chandrayan-3 mishan main isro vaigyanik chandrayan-3 kii yatra kaa samay kam kar de
 To do this, it should make Chandrayaan-3 less orbiting the Earth and the Moon
 saath hi lander ke paanv zyada majboot banaae jaaen
 So that the lander is not harmed when landing fast
 vah krash na ho

 ghunghraale bal dekhne main bhale bahut khubasurat lagate hon lekin unhen sanbhaalanaa kisi kaam se kam nahin he
 You can neither keep such hair open for a long time nor by tying it for a long time
 ghunghraale bal, street baalo kii tulana main zyada ruukhe hote hai
 The biggest reason for this is that people often use straighter or use chemical products to manage such hair
 agar aapke bhi bal ghunghraale hai or aapako unhen manage karne kaa sahi tarika pataa nahin he to ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 By adopting these measures, you will be able to manage your curly hair easily
 1:hair brush kii jagah chaude daanton vaali kanghee kaa prayog karen
 This will solve hair quickly and reduce breakage
 2:kanghee karte samay neeche se upar kii ore uljhan sulajhaayen
 Many knots are formed on the ends of hair, which only after combing, comb the entire hair
 3:baalo main condishnar lagane ke baad ek tauliye ko garm pani main dubokar acchhee tarah nichod den
 Tie this towel for a while and leave it in the head
 isse condishnar acchhee tarah baalo main samaa jayega
 4: Comb the hair only after applying the conditioner
 iske baad baalo ko acchhee tarah dho len
 By doing this the hair will get less tangled
 5:koshish karen ki apane baalo se condishnar ko puri tarah naa saaf karen kyonkighungharaale baalo ko nami kii zyadajarurat hoti he
 6: After washing, mix moisturizer and a little conditioner and apply it on your hair

 Every person who wants to buy his house does not necessarily have the status to buy it
 lagaataar badhati aabaadi se gharon kii bhayankar kami he so alag
 In such a situation, it is important to promote rental housing
 isse judi ummiden bhi is bajet main lagi hai
 Rental housing can be a great option to overcome the shortage of residential housing
 lekin iske liye inakam tex kanoon main badlaav karnaa hoga
 Under Section 24A, the exemption on rent income will be increased from 30 to 50 per cent
 saath hi mahilaon or varisht nagarikon ke liye ye riyaayat 100 fisadi kerani hogi
 Doing so will not only remove the shortage of houses, but will also put pressure on the prices of houses

 sarkaar ne share bazaar main chote niveshkon kii bhagidaari badhaane ke liye tex chhot samet tamaam tarah ke elaan beete kai barason main bajet ke dauraan kiye hai
 Similarly, now the government should come forward to help investors who want to make money through real estate
 real estate sector main chote niveshkon kii bhagidaari ke liye bhi thos kadam uthaanaa chahie
 Become real estate investment trusts so that small investors can invest in shares of real estate companies
 sebi kaaphi samay se inhen launch karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The government may consider giving tax rebates to those who invest in it
 is tarah ke nivesh ke nae raste taiyaar hone se videshi niveshak bhi yahaan par paisa lagane kaa ek nayaa vikalp dhund sakate hai

 Chaiwala, Fakir, Pradhan Sevak, Chowkidar, Saheb, and you don't know what! You are the first Prime Minister of independent India who has many faces
 jo ki apni suvidhanusaar un chehron kaa matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye istemaal karata he
 But which of these is your real face? You became a chaiwala in 2014
 aapaki piaar team ne aapaki is chhavi ko khub bechaa or vot batora
 But till now no evidence has been found that you have even touched the tea kettle
 ab jab aapane chaay bechi hi nahin to aap chywala kaise ho gaye modi ji?phir bharat ko das lakh kaa suut pahanane vaala pehla fakir bhi mila
 One such fakir who is said to have spent thousands of rupees on makeup
 aapaki kalam, din main kai baar badale jane vaale aapke kapade, aapkaa naashtaa or aapkaa khaanaa sabaki badi charchaa hoti rahi he
 2000 crores, you burnt in foreign travels and 4600 crores in advertisements
 aapaki is fakiri ko dekhakar to achche achche fakiron ke hosh faakhtaa ho jaaen
 The matter is not limited to just these 'adjectives' Modi ji
 2014 ke pehle aap kaala dhan virdohi the, bhrashtachar virdohi the, jiesti virdohi the, pakistan ko 'lav letters' likhe jane ke khilaaf the, china ko aap laal ankhen dikhaanaa chaahate the, ganga maa ke bete the, smart cities or adarsh gaanvon kaa sapana bechney vaale rajaneta the, swaminathan ayog kii report ke sachche samarthak the
 But from 2014 onwards, they all went on the contrary
 kaale dhan waalon ko aapane videsh bhaga diya, rafel main anil ambani ke saath bhrashtachar ke bhagidaar ban gaye, aadhi raat main sansad khulwakar jiesti bill paas karavaaya lekin isse desh ke kaarobaar kii qamar tut gai, ganga nadi kii sthiti ab bhi dayaneey he, berogari ne saare ricards dhwast kar die hai, aap bin bulaae pakistan jaakar biryani kha aae, china ke rashtrapramukh ke saath aap jhula jhulate dikhe, banaras ko kioto bananaa to 'har khate main 15-15 lakh' jaisaa jumala hi sabit hua

 Modi ji is ready? bhartiya janata party in dinon deshbhar main sadsyta abhiyaan chalaakar logon ko party se jodne main lagi he
 But the form being filled by this membership campaign has created controversy in the politics of Madhya Pradesh
 is form main bijepi sadsyta lene waalon se unki jati ke bare main bhi puch rahi he
 It was claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party has been voted above the caste equations by people of all castes and classes in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 desh ko sabase zyada pradhanmantri dene vaala rajya uttar pradesh jo ki jatigat samikarnon kii sabase badi prayogshaala bhi he, vahaan par bhi pichley do loksabhaa chunaav or is bich hue vidhansabha chunaav main jis tarah se bijepi ko sabhi jatiyon ke vot mili use dekhakar yahi laga ki bijepi ne vaaki desh main jatigat vot bank kii raajnneeti ko kahin peeche chhod diya he
 But now the membership of the Bharatiya Janata Party which is running across the country these days, people are also being asked to get their caste in the form being filled to take membership
 bataanaa hoga 'jati varg'bhartiya janata party ke sadsyta abhiyaan ke form main nae sadasyon se yah poocha ja rahaa he ki vah kis jati varg se sambandh rakhte hai
 There are also 5 options for this in the form
 jisamen nae banane vaale sadsy ko yah bataanaa hoga ki vah saamaanya, obisi, anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati yaa anya jati varg se he
 Caste column in the form Congress said 'partition politics' When the caste column appeared in the membership form of BJP, there was controversy in the politics of Madhya Pradesh and the Congress got an opportunity to attack the BJP
 congress pravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha, 'bhartiya janata party hameshaa se jatigat raajnneeti karti ai he
 It is different that PM Modi was heard speaking in the election that we do not do caste politics and this politics is done by BSP and Samajwadi Party
 lekin asaliyat yah he ki bijepi hameshaa se isi tarah se bantwaare kii raajnneeti karti ai he or isi kaa pramaan he ki vah apane membership form main logon se puch rahe hai vah kis jati ke hai
 'when all the sections of the society will be connected, the dispute on caste in membership form increased, then the national in-charge of the membership drive and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan had to come forward himself
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress ke aaropon ko dakiyanoosee bataate hue kaha kii party samaaj ke har varg ko saath main lekar chalanaa chaahati he or iske liye hi yah sari kavayad kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, Shivraj Singh Chauhan advised the Congress that the party should first complete the search for its president
 shivaraj ne kaha, 'bijepi sabaki baat karti he
 When we are saying all are touchy, then we will connect every section of the society
 ham isamen koun-sa paap kar rahe hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party will go to every section of the society and omnipresence will be added to every booth

 Computer Ji played the song 'whose wife long' of Amitabh's film 'lavaris' after which Amitabh said, "kahe are embarrassing us
 tameez nahin he aapako?" iske baad amitabh bachchan ne is gane ke banane ke peeche kii kahani bhi sho ke set par sunai jo ki shaayad tamaam logon ko nahin maaloom hogi
 How was this song made? Amitabh told, "actually we are from Allahabad and these songs are such songs in Shaadi Vivaah when there is music
 hamane ye gaanaa babuji ke munh se suna tha
 When there was a festival of Holi, Babuji used to sing these songs with dholak and so on and when we came to Mumbai, we used to play with our friends while celebrating Holi here
 prakaash mehara ji, jo ki hamaari tamaam filmon ke nirdeshak rahe hai, unhen hamane ek baar holi par apane yahaan bulaayaa hua tha
 When he heard this song from our mouth, he said that we should sing this song
 "amitabh ne KBC main chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke 'apmaan' par maangi maafibig bi ne bataaya ki hamane mehara saab ko ye gaanaa le jane ko kaha to unhone kaha ki sirf gaanaa dene kii baat nahin he, aapako ye gaanaa gaanaa bhi padegaa
 Amitabh said that we had sung this song somehow

 Minister of State for Frontier Development Siddique Ahmed and Public Health Engineering Minister Gautam Rai have accused each other of helping Rumi get married to Zakir even though she is not legally separated from her first husband
 yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab baraak ghati ke ye do diggaj saarvajanik rup se takaraae hai
 Actually, there is a competition between the two to become the undisputed leader of the region
 janvari main ahamed ke grih janapad karimganj ke intpur main akashwani ke efem stesan ke shilanyas samaaroh main ahamed or raay jhagad chuke hai
 Rumi, 33, already married and mother of a two-year-old girl and 29-year-old Zakir, a lower division assistant in the social welfare department of Bhanga in Karimganj district, went missing from Silchar on May 22, and then on June 4 from Rumi, Guwahati
 Appeared in government house only
 rumi ne duusari shaadi karne kii baat to sweekaar kii lekin un khabaron kaa khandan kiya ki ve musalmaan ho gai hai
 He told India Today, "I have not converted to Islam
 maine ise keval shaadi karne ke liye apanaaya he
 It was Ahmed who helped me get married with Zakir and now he is spreading the news of my conversion

 At the time, he dismissed the news saying that his profile had been hacked
 ahamed ne yah kehete hue shaadi main apni bhoomika se inkaar kiya he ki 13 april ko shaadi ke baad jakir ne raay ko phone kiya tha
 "I was with Rai at that time with another minister," says Ahmed
 jab jakir ne phone kiya to raay ne hamen sunaane ke liye phone kaa laudspikar on kar diya
 Rai refused to react to Ahmed's allegations
 unhone india today se kaha, ''ve jo kahana chahen, kahen

 While Rumi's first husband has filed a suit in Silchar Sessions Court alleging theft and illegal marriage, Rumi has filed a counter petition in Dispur police station saying that Dr
 rakesh kumaar singh ne unhen shaareerik or maansik taur par pareshaan kiya tha
 Rumi won the assembly election in 2004 from Barkhola seat in Silchar district on a BJP ticket
 lekin 2010 main rajyasabha chunaav main congress ko phayda pahunchane ke uddeshy se cross-voting karne ke chalate ve bhaajapa se nishkasit kar di gai thim
 In the 2011 assembly elections, the Congress rewarded her with a ticket and she won again

 "instead of taking an interest in my marriage, the party people have better things to do," says Rumi
 '' During the preparations for the triple talaq, a number of articles appeared to have a grudge about the media, especially the news channels
 yahi ki media khaaskar tivi ne teen talaak ke masale ko haa yaa naa main badal kar rakh diya he
 Whereas, apart from yes or no, it is also the options that can happen after the end of three divorces, which is a different opinion among all the organizations
 news channel is tarah kii ninsaphi sirf muslim muddon ke saath nahin karte balki tamaam raajnneetik or gair dharmik muddon ke saath bhi karte hai
 It can be nothing now
 tivi ke dibet kaa makasad bhadaas nikaalnaa hota he
 Not to state your opinion better than before
 itani baat to abhi tak samaj hi gaye honge
 There is no need to pass matriculation for this
 jammu kashmir main pidipi bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has several times requested the so-called national media not to discuss the debate in such a way that hatred should spread to the people of Jammu and Kashmir in India
 teen talaaq ko lekar muslim mahila sanghathanon kii raay main hi kaaphi fark he
 The Indian Muslim Women's Movement wants an immediate triple talaq to end but the Uniform Civil Code is not imposed
 isaki jagah koran main talaaq kii jo prakriya he use hi sunniyon par lagu kiya jaae
 The Muslim Women's League demands that religious law should not be imposed on Muslim women
 sharai kanoon radd kar diya jaae or uski jagah indian marriage lau banaaya jaae
 Shaira Bano considers the three talaqs to be unconstitutional and demands a uniform civil code
 iske do matlab hue ki muslim mahilaon kii duniya main is vakt kai tarah kii bechainiyaan hai
 One restlessness wants a solution to its issue within the Qur'an's scope, while another restlessness seeks a solution to its issue according to the principle of law
 ek tarah se muslim mahilaon ke bich yah baat spasht he ki sharia ko chhod yaa to koran lagu ho yaa samvidhan lagu ho, twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho
 It is also not true that the Maulana people are also involved in this debate in the same way
 bahut se moulana yaa islamic vidwaan yah chaahate hai ki twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho jaae
 Hilal Ahmed in his article has presented a list of the types of debate between the Maulanas, - ahale haddees sunni kehete hai ki teen talaak kaa koi dharmik aadhaar nahin he, lekin ve personal lau board ko chalange nahin karte hai
 - Many traditional ulema associated with the board have considered the triple talaq right on religious and legal grounds
 - board ne ab jaakar ek baar main teen talaaq ko galat mana he, lekin talaaq kii lambii or mushkil prakriya banaai he
 This fight is also about whether the supremacy of the Quran should apply to the lives of women or Indian Muslims, or the social rules that you call Sharia after the interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith in the Caliphate era
 aapako yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki koran ke saath saath sharia bhi to islamic kaanoon kaa hissaa rahaa hi he
 It is true that Islam is one and the Qur'an is one, but under Islam there are different creeds, firings and their own Sharia
 sharia kaa matlab hota zindagi kaa rasta
 Fat fat, understand that the caution is to be taken while walking on the road, it is not mentioned in the Quran, but what will you do if you are not separated from your constitutional responsibilities while walking on the road
 niyam kaa paalan karenge
 This rule is called Sharia
 hilaal ahamed ne likhaa he ki agar shariat par itnaa hi jor he jiske tahat teen talaak kaa kuch log samarthan karte hai to kya ve chori karne par haath katwane ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 In the 80s, the famous and prolific writer Rahi Masoom Raza wrote an article in Hans magazine, which he said he needed in the Islam Katpees
 raahi maasoom raza ne bharat ke musalamaanon par tanj karte hue likhaa tha ki shariat ke hisaab se teen talaaq agar manzur he to usee ke hisaab se chori karne par haath katwane kii sazaa kyon nahin manzur kar lete
 Former chairman of the Law Commission of India, Tahir Mahmood has written in the Indian Express that even if there is a divorce instead of three divorces, whatsapp will continue to be divorced by email
 isliye ekatarfa talaq kii prakriya samaapt honi chahie
 Don't be locked by the will of the man
 taahir mahmud or nalsar, hyderabad ke vaais chancelar faizan mustafaa ke lekh main yah baat pramukhataa se ubhartee he ki is badlaav main sansad kii bhi ahm bhoomika he
 After the end of the quick triple talaq, what should be the new arrangement, all the parties agree to it and a committee should sit and then the legislative process starts
 taahir mahmud court kii bhoomika bhi maanate hai jaise 1995 main court ne hi gair musalamaanon ko duusari shaadi karne ke liye islam apnaane par roak laga di thi
 Another aspect of this debate is that Muslim personal law is not all Sharia of Sara
 personal lau ke tahat teen act aise hai jise vidhaayi manyata hasil he
 Muslim Personal Law Application Act 1937, Resolution of Muslim Marriage Act 1939, Muslim Woman (protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986
 1937 or 1939 kaa act angrezon ne banaaya tha jise azaadi ke pehle anglo mohammaden lau kehete the, azaadi ke baad muslim personal lau kahalaane laga
 The Muslim Personal Law Board is not a constitutional body
 na hi ye board sanvaidhanik adhikaar dilaane kii guarantee de saktaa he
 Many people are confused by the name of the Law Board whether it has constitutional or legal recognition
 vaise kai log maanate hai ki in teenon act main bhi sudhaar kii bahut zarurat he
 a change has come
 twarit teen talaak muslim mahilaon kii shuru kii gai ladaai he, lambey arse tak muslim mard isse dur rahe lekin aaj is ladaai main badi sankhya main muslim mard auraton ke saath hai
 Look at the names of those writing against instant triple talaq, Javed Anand, Arif Mohammad Khan, Shahid Siddiqui, Hilal Ahmed, Tahir Mahmood, Faizan Mustafa
 ab bataa den ki supreme court ne sunwaayee shuru karte hi is bahes kaa dayera tay kiya he
 There will be a hearing on whether quick triple talaq is legal or not
 peeth ye dekhegi ki teen talaaq kya islam kaa mul ang he
 Can it be considered a fundamental right on the basis of religious freedom

 20 se adhim mulkon main teen talaaq ko samaapt kar diya gaya he
 The audience of Hindi can read the article of Amreen printed in the pattern of Vani Prakashan
 iraq ne 1959 main talaaq, niqaah, kanoon ko badalakar vivaah samhita jari kii thi
 Such changes were made in Syria in 1953
 1959 main alzyria ne bhi ek adhyadesh jari kar sabhi prakaar ke talaaq ko court ke daayre main laa diya tha
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) There is a lot of difference in the opinion of Muslim women's organizations regarding triple talaq
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan chahta he ki twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho magar uniform civil code na thopa jaae
 Instead, the procedure of divorce in the Qur'an should be applied only to the Sunnis
 muslim vimens lig kii maang he ki muslim mahilaon par dharmik kanoon lagu hi na ho
 Sharia law should be repealed and Indian Marriage Law should be replaced instead
 shaayara bano teen talak ko asanvaidhanik maanati hai or unifarm civil code kii maang karti hai
 This means that there are many types of anxiety in the world of Muslim women at this time
 ek bechaini apane masale kaa hal koran ke daayre main chaahati he to duusari bechaini apane masale kaa hal kanoon ke siddhant ke anusaar chaahati he
 In a way, it is clear among Muslim women that except the Shariah either the Qur'an is in force or the constitution is in force, the instant triple talaq should be ended
 yah baat bhi thik nahin he ki moulana log bhi ek hi tarah se is bahes main shaamil hai
 Many Maulana or Islamic scholars want the quick triple talaq to end
 hilaal ahamed ne apane lekh main moulanaon ke bich kitne prakaar kii bahes he uski suchi pesh kii he, - Ahle Hadith Sunni states that triple talaq has no religious basis, but does not challenge the Personal Law Board
 - board se jude kai paaramparik ulema teen talaak ko dharmik or kanoonee aadhaar par sahi maanate rahe hai
 - The board has now considered three divorces wrong at once, but has made the process of divorce long and difficult
 yah ladaai is baat ko lekar bhi he ki mahilaon yaa bhartiya musalamaanon ke jivan par koran kii sarvocchata lagu ho yaa caliphaaon ke daur main koran or haddees kii vyakhya ke baad jo saamaajik niyam bane hai jise aap sharia kehete hai wo lagu ho
 You also have to understand that along with the Quran, Sharia has also been a part of Islamic law
 yah sahi baat he ki islam ek he or koran ek he magar islam ke tahat alag alag panth hai, firake hai or unke apane apane sharia hai
 Sharia means the way of life
 motaa moti yah samajhaye ki sadak par chalate vakt kya saavdhaanee apanaai jaae, iskaa zikr to kuran main nahin he lekin aap sadak par chalate vakt apane sanvaidhanik zimmedaariyon se bhi alag nahin hai to kya karenge
 Will follow the rule
 yahi niyam sharia kehalaata he
 Hilal Ahmed has written that if there is such a strong emphasis on Sharia under which some people support the triple talaq, then are they ready to get their hands off on stealing
 80 ke dashak main mashhoor or shandaar lekhak raahi maasoom raza ne hans patrika main ek lekh likhaa jiskaa unvaan tha inhen islam catapis main chahie
 Rahi Innocent Raza wrote on the Muslims of India, that if three divorces are allowed according to the Shari'a, then why would they not accept punishment for stealing their hands according to that
 lau kamishan of india ke purv chairman taahir mahmud ne indian express main likhaa he ki teen talaak kii jagah ek talaak bhi ho to bhi whatsap, email se talaaq dene kii beemaari rah hi jaaegi
 Therefore, the process of unilateral lock should end
 mard kii marji se talaq na ho
 In the article by Tahir Mahmood and Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa of Nalsar, Hyderabad, it emerges prominently that Parliament also has an important role in this change
 twarit teen talaak kii samaapti ke baad nai vyavastha kya ho, sabhi pakshon ko manzur ho iske liye koi cameti baithe or phir vidhaayi prakriya shuru ho
 Tahir Mahmud also considers the role of the court as in 1995, the court prohibited non-muslims from adopting Islam to get a second marriage
 is bahes kaa ek or pahalu he ki muslim personal lau sara kaa sara sharia nahin he
 There are three Acts which have legislative recognition under Personal Law
 muslim personal lau aplication act 1937, dizolution of muslim marriage act 1939, muslim vuman (protection of ritis on divorce) act 1986
 The Acts of 1937 and 1939 were created by the British, which was called Anglo Mohammedan Law before independence, after independence started to be called Muslim Personal Law
 muslim personal lau board sanvaidhanik sanstha nahin he
 Nor can these boards guarantee constitutional rights
 kai log lau board naam hone se kanphyus ho jate hai ki ise sanvaidhanik yaa kanoonee manyata hasil he
 By the way, many people believe that there is a great need for improvement in these three acts too
 ek badlaav or aayaa he
 Rapid triple talaq is a fight started by Muslim women, Muslim men stayed away from it for a long time but today a large number of Muslim men are with women in this fight
 aap twarit teen talaak ke kilaaf likhane waalon ke naam dekh lijie, javed anand, aarif mohammad khan, shahid siddiki, hilaal ahamed, taahir mahmud, faizan mustafaa
 Now let us know that the Supreme Court has fixed the scope of this debate as soon as it starts hearing
 twarit teen talaaq legal he yaa nahin, is par sunwaayee hogi
 The bench will see whether triple talaq is a fundamental part of Islam
 kya ise dharmik swatantraaa ke aadhaar par moulik adhikaar mana ja saktaa he
 If the triple talaq comes under religious freedom, the court will not interfere
 iske baad zarurat padi to halaala par sunwaayee hogi magar bahuvivaah par sunwaayee nahin hogi
 The comments supreme court pakistan samet duusare deshon ke kanoon bhi dekhegaa jahaan teen talaaq khatm kiya gaya he
 In more than 20 countries, three divorces have been abolished
 hindi ke darshak vaani prakaashan ke pratimaan main chape amarine kaa lekh pard sakate hai
 Iraq had issued the Marriage Code in 1959, changing the law of divorce, marriage and marriage
 syria main 1953 main aise badlaav kiye gaye the
 Algeria also issued an ordinance in 1959 bringing all types of divorces to court
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) iske do matlab hue ki muslim mahilaon kii duniya main is vakt kai tarah kii bechainiyaan hai
 One restlessness wants a solution to its issue within the Qur'an's scope, while another restlessness seeks a solution to its issue according to the principle of law
 ek tarah se muslim mahilaon ke bich yah baat spasht he ki sharia ko chhod yaa to koran lagu ho yaa samvidhan lagu ho, twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho
 It is also not true that the Maulana people are also involved in this debate in the same way
 bahut se moulana yaa islamic vidwaan yah chaahate hai ki twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho jaae
 Hilal Ahmed in his article has presented a list of the types of debate between the Maulanas, - ahale haddees sunni kehete hai ki teen talaak kaa koi dharmik aadhaar nahin he, lekin ve personal lau board ko chalange nahin karte hai
 - Many traditional ulema associated with the board have considered the triple talaq right on religious and legal grounds
 - board ne ab jaakar ek baar main teen talaaq ko galat mana he, lekin talaaq kii lambii or mushkil prakriya banaai he
 This fight is also about whether the supremacy of the Quran should apply to the lives of women or Indian Muslims, or the social rules that you call Sharia after the interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith in the Caliphate era
 aapako yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki koran ke saath saath sharia bhi to islamic kaanoon kaa hissaa rahaa hi he
 It is true that Islam is one and the Qur'an is one, but under Islam there are different creeds, firings and their own Sharia
 sharia kaa matlab hota zindagi kaa rasta
 Fat fat, understand that the caution is to be taken while walking on the road, it is not mentioned in the Quran, but what will you do if you are not separated from your constitutional responsibilities while walking on the road
 niyam kaa paalan karenge
 This rule is called Sharia
 hilaal ahamed ne likhaa he ki agar shariat par itnaa hi jor he jiske tahat teen talaak kaa kuch log samarthan karte hai to kya ve chori karne par haath katwane ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 In the 80s, the famous and prolific writer Rahi Masoom Raza wrote an article in Hans magazine, which he said he needed in the Islam Katpees
 raahi maasoom raza ne bharat ke musalamaanon par tanj karte hue likhaa tha ki shariat ke hisaab se teen talaaq agar manzur he to usee ke hisaab se chori karne par haath katwane kii sazaa kyon nahin manzur kar lete
 Former chairman of the Law Commission of India, Tahir Mahmood has written in the Indian Express that even if there is a divorce instead of three divorces, whatsapp will continue to be divorced by email
 isliye ekatarfa talaq kii prakriya samaapt honi chahie
 Don't be locked by the will of the man
 taahir mahmud or nalsar, hyderabad ke vaais chancelar faizan mustafaa ke lekh main yah baat pramukhataa se ubhartee he ki is badlaav main sansad kii bhi ahm bhoomika he
 After the end of the quick triple talaq, what should be the new arrangement, all the parties agree to it and a committee should sit and then the legislative process starts
 taahir mahmud court kii bhoomika bhi maanate hai jaise 1995 main court ne hi gair musalamaanon ko duusari shaadi karne ke liye islam apnaane par roak laga di thi
 Another aspect of this debate is that Muslim personal law is not all Sharia of Sara
 personal lau ke tahat teen act aise hai jise vidhaayi manyata hasil he
 Muslim Personal Law Application Act 1937, Resolution of Muslim Marriage Act 1939, Muslim Woman (protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986
 1937 or 1939 kaa act angrezon ne banaaya tha jise azaadi ke pehle anglo mohammaden lau kehete the, azaadi ke baad muslim personal lau kahalaane laga
 The Muslim Personal Law Board is not a constitutional body
 na hi ye board sanvaidhanik adhikaar dilaane kii guarantee de saktaa he
 Many people are confused by the name of the Law Board whether it has constitutional or legal recognition
 vaise kai log maanate hai ki in teenon act main bhi sudhaar kii bahut zarurat he
 a change has come
 twarit teen talaak muslim mahilaon kii shuru kii gai ladaai he, lambey arse tak muslim mard isse dur rahe lekin aaj is ladaai main badi sankhya main muslim mard auraton ke saath hai
 Look at the names of those writing against instant triple talaq, Javed Anand, Arif Mohammad Khan, Shahid Siddiqui, Hilal Ahmed, Tahir Mahmood, Faizan Mustafa
 ab bataa den ki supreme court ne sunwaayee shuru karte hi is bahes kaa dayera tay kiya he
 There will be a hearing on whether quick triple talaq is legal or not
 peeth ye dekhegi ki teen talaaq kya islam kaa mul ang he
 Can it be considered a fundamental right on the basis of religious freedom
 agar teen talaaq dharmik swatantraaa ke tahat aayega to court dakhal nahin degaa
 After this, if required, there will be a hearing on Hallala but there will be no hearing on polygamy
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court will also look into the laws of other countries including Pakistan where three divorces have been abolished
 20 se adhim mulkon main teen talaaq ko samaapt kar diya gaya he

 Therefore, a new trend of travel, 'slow travel' is becoming the choice of people
 log ab remote aria main chhuttiyaan bitaana pasand karte hai jahaan wo paidal yaa cycle se puri yatra kar saken
 TRAVEL CHOICE TO TRAVEL PASSENGERS TRAVEL website, Trip Advisors believes that the speed of travel has now slowed down and tourists prefer to travel by train instead of flight to experience their destination nearby
 saath hi ve har wo kaam karnaa chaahate hai jo us jagah ke local log karte hai
 Its purpose is that they can enjoy life and things there
 har pal ko jeena he makasadab travel or paryatak, donon kii paribhaasha badal rahi he
 Holidays are no longer just for getting rid of everyday life
 log chaahate hai ki unke paas yatra ke pal aise hon jo chhuttiyaan khatm hone ke baad bhi unke jehan main taaja rahen or unhen agali chuttee tak energy dete rahen
 Experts in the field of travel marketing know the experience of knowing the local area closely
 The experience of traveling is always different and slow travel captures every moment of travel
 is bhagdaud ke samay main slo travel logon ko naa sirf relex karata he balki unhen har pal ko jeene kaa mauka bhi detaa he
 Enjoying the local house and spending a few moments with the local residents makes it a different feeling
 weekend travel se bachane lage hai logadigital world se dur rahane kii chahat kahen yaa apane dimag ko shant rakhane kii zarurat, log ab 'over-da-weekend' travel se batch rahe hai, jahaan chhuttiyaan shuru hone se pehle hi khatm ho jaati hai
 Today's travelers are very advanced
 ve asaadhaaran chijen dekhne main vishwaas rakhte hai
 Slow travel for many means staying away from luxury
 kuch alag karne kii chahatkuch logon ke liye 'slo travel' kaa matlab kashmir ke kisi regart main kitaaben padhate hue vakt bitaana he to kisi ke liye himachal ke kisi math main meditation karnaa
 Be it fishing or boat riding, long walking tour or long train journey, all these can be included in the plans of slow travel
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi kaa kahana he ki congress ke vidhayak, argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ke saath hone se bahut zyada khafa he
 Even after a long exercise by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, there is no confidence in the mlas of Bihar Congress
 darasal haal hi main bihar pradesh congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke pehle kaarykram main party ke 27 main se ek vidhayak ne hi kaarykram main hissaa liya tha
 The Congress high command had removed Ashok Chaudhary from the state president's post and appointed Koukab Qadri as acting president in view of fears of a breakdown in the Bihar Congress mlas
 isse pehle ashok choudhary par hi party todane kaa aarope laga tha or uske baad jab kaaryakari adhyaksh prabhaar lene aae to sadakat ashram main 27 main se sirf ek vidhayak hi kaarykram main pahunchaa
 According to Sushil Modi, 15 mlas and mlcs reached out to express solidarity with the Dalit leader who was removed by the Congress high command on charges of indiscipline
 susheel modi ne congress ko kaha he ki congress ko aankh moond keralalu prasadka saath dene kii keemat chukaani padegi
 Ever since the break-up of the Grand Alliance government, the news of the Congress breakdown had started coming
 khabar thi ki congress ke tabake pradesh adhyaksh ashok choudhary ke netritv main 14 vidhayakon ne congress todne kaa faisla kar liya he
 When the news reached the high command, then the high command spoke to the mlas and it was later decided that Ashok Chaudhary should be removed from the post of Speaker
 unki jagah par party main sanghathan ke chunaav hone tak party ke upaadhyaksh kokeb kadri ko kaaryakari adhyaksh niyukt kiya he
 Qadri's first responsibility is to save the party from breakup, so as soon as he takes office, he said that he can also fall on someone's feet to save the party
 haalanki jis tareeke vidhayakon ne unke pad bhaar samaaroh ko nazarandaaj kiya he, usase lagata he ki ye apil shaayad hi kaam karen
 It is believed that due to the appointment of the Executive Speaker, the mlas have not given much value to them, as well as due to Navratri many mlas are in their constituency

 Putrada Ekadashi is celebrated all over the country, but in North India, where Pausha Shukla Paksha Ekadashi is celebrated exclusively, in South India, Shravan Putrada Ekadashi (sharavan Putrada Ekadashi) is more important

 pudducheri main uparajyapal kiran bedi or mukhyamantri narayansami ke bich badhate tanaav ke baad dilli pradesh ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne congress ko nishane par liya he
 In Delhi, the quarrel between the Aam Aadmi Party government and the LG is quite old
 isi kaa hawala dete hue kejariwal congress se sawaal puch rahe hai
 Here let us tell you that in Puducherry, there is a dispute between the CM of Congress and the LG Kiran Bedi appointed by the BJP government at the Center about the functioning of the day
 vahaan kii sthiti kuch-kuch waisi hi he jaisi dilli meservind kejarivalki alji ke saath he
 To this, Kejriwal tweeted that "congress should decide whether lg's interference in the functioning of elected government is good or bad
" aakhir alji kaa hastkshep dilli main acha or pudducheri main kharaab kaise ho saktaa he"
 The Aam Aadmi Party can currently be seen being aggressive on the Congress
 arvind kejariwal ke media salaahkaar nagendra sharma bhi twit karke likhte hai ki "congress rachanaakaar he sarkaar yaelji karyalayaka durupyog karne main
 The BJP has learned from the Congress how to upset the elected government
 philhal pudducheri ke mukhyamantri ise kathin tareeke se sikh rahe hai"
 However, it is very interesting that the Congress has come under the target of Aam Aadmi Party, which is showing BJP connection of Delhi LG
 isse pehle arvind kejariwal or 'aap' netaa dilli main alji ko piem modi kaa agent bataakar sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main adnga daalane ke aarope aksar lagaate aae hai
 What did Ashutosh say about the problems of the Delhi government? Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh is attacking the LG of Delhi citing the tensions between Kiran Bedi and Narayanasamy in Puducherry
 ve kehete hai ki dilli ke bheetar alji ke madhyam se bijepi thik usee tarah se sarkaar ko sucharu dhang se chalane nahin de rahi jis tarah pudducheri main congress
 In such a situation, to support LG in Congress Delhi is to support BJP
 naukarshahon ke sahyog va asahyoh par bhi bole
 
 
 Ashutosh says that the message is being deliberately sent to the bureaucrats by the BJP in Delhi not to coordinate with the AAP government
 ve kehete hai ki yah to janata kii chuni hui sarkaar par nirbhar karata he ki vah kaise sarkaar chalaae
 According to him, BJP has created such a situation in Delhi that the bureaucrats of the state are not ready to work
 aise main kaam badhaane ke liye unhen koi na koi rasta to nikaalnaa hoga
 He further states that the work done in the Delhi government, the relationship with the bureaucracy and the work done by the officials comes under the jurisdiction of the government
 party us par tippanee nahin karnaa chaahati
 However, they say that the Central Government should stop the threat of the bureaucrats of Delhi
 ve isi kram main kehete hai ki naukarshah dilli sarkaar ke saath kaam karnaa chaahate hai lekin unka bhi apana karier he
 They finally mention the emergency
 ve kehete hai ki in dinon har vipakshi party ko target kiya ja rahaa he
 Police, Income Tax, I
A
 bi or sibiai kaa istemaal vipakshi partiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he

 aise main rikt hui donon rajyasabha siton par ek saath chunaav hue or vidhayakon ne sirf ek baar main vot diya to bijepi or congress donon ek-ek siten jeet sakate hai
 That is why Congress is in favor of holding elections simultaneously in both the seats

 Yoga is being used equally in special sports like shooting
 shooting se jude khilaadi or coach ko lagata he ki yoga ke sahi istemaal se in khelon main olympic padak hasil karne main bhi badi madad mil sakati he
 How is yoga related to shooting? Experts say that not only in India, many shooters from all over the world have started practicing yoga for good shooting

 masalan tarasana se khilaadiyon ko santulan banane main, dhyaan se fokas banane main or pranayam se nishane ke vakt khud ko sthir rakhane main madad milti he
 Breath control is essential for good shooting
 aam logon ke liye yoga sehat se judaa masalaa ho saktaa he, lekin achche nishanebaaz iske zariye podium tak pahunchane kaa rasta dhundne lage hai
 Actually, in shooting, yoga shows a direct effect compared to any other sport

 Today i am happy that we are going to launch important schemes in the budget that we promised, during this Diwali festival and while Dhanteras and people buy gold exclusively on that day
 ham ‘gold monetigeshan skim’ laae hai
 Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will pay interest on it like you deposit your money and get interest

 He said that today you have taken a gold bond according to the value of gold of 1000 rupees and after five years you went to return the bond and at that time the price of gold is two and a half thousand rupees
 to us kaagaj ke badale main aapako dhai hajaar rupee milenge
 He said that we are starting this
 iske kaaran ab hamen sona kharidne kii jarurat nahin padegi, sona sanbhaalane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 The worry of where to keep the gold will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper
 modi ne kaha ki main suraksha kii guarantee vaali ye skim aane vaale hafton main jarur deshavaasiyon ke saamne rakhuunga
 i am happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins
 aazaadee kareeb kareeb 70 saal hue, lekin ab tak ham videshi sikkon kaa hi upyog karte rahe hai

 Rather, you have to tell where in which hospital what improvement has taken place
 hamen uski puri report chahie
 'explain that the petitioner was engaged on behalf of a woman who was 9 months pregnant and lost her child due to hospital negligence
 yachikakarta ke vakil prashanth manachanda ne court ko bataaya ki aspataalon ke halaat kitne badtar hai

 upi ke baahar ke rajyon main bhi badi sankhya main sanghathan se log jude hai lekin andolan jaise kaary karne kii ijaajat kisi ko bhi nahin he
 The biggest problem facing the Hindu Yuva Vahini is also about the identity of its members
 sanghathan ne ab tak sadasyon se jude aankadon kaa dastavej taiyaar hi nahin kiya he
 Malla says, "information is being collected about the members of the Hindu Yuva Vahini working at the district, state level
 in sabakaa dastavejikaran kiya jayega
 The Hindu Yuva Vahini is also going through the problem of wealth
 sanghathan ke paas apane saanskrithik kaaryakramon ko purajor tareeke se chalaane ke liye dhan nahin he, isse isaki maujuudagi bhi simit ho rahi he
 The Gorakhnath temple complex has a state office of the Hindu Yuva Vahini but the organization does not have sufficient resources to open offices in the districts
 mall bataate hai, ''jilon ke varisht padaadhikariyon ke ghar par sanghathan kaa karyaalay kholkar gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan kiya ja rahaa he
 After Yogi Adityanath became the Chief Minister, there has been a change in the attitude of the Hindu Yuva Vahini
 ugr hindutv kaa pairokaar rahaa yah sanghathan ab aisi koi gatividhi sanchalit nahin karnaa chahta, jisase yogi ko asahaj sthiti kaa saamana karnaa pade
 Last year, during the floods in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts, its workers carried out massive rescue-relief work
 uske baad se sanghathan gaanv str par paudharopan, svachh peyajal jaise saamaajik abhiyaan kaa bhi sanchaalan kar rahaa he
 Malla explains, "A 'monitoring system' has been devised from the activists of the Hindu Yuva Vahini spread across the village-countryside
 iske jariye sanghathan pradesh sarkaar kii yojanaon ke bare main feedback juta rahaa he
 Despite this, the biggest challenge before the Hindu Yuva Vahini is to hold on to the young activists who are advocates of militant Hindutva
 kyonki ugrata se sanghathan kii chhavi bighad rahi he
 *** cuba kii rahane vaali asaata kareeb 68 saal kii hai or 1971 se lekar 1973 tak unhen kai aparaadhon main sanlipt paaya gaya he
 In 1979, Asata, who was sentenced to death by a bank robbery and the murder of a policeman, fled to Cuba, and after 30 years, Asata still has a heavy prize
 asaata kii kahani kisi film se kam nahin he
 According to information available on the internet, in 1971, Asata, who had entered a hotel in the US for the purpose of robbing, knocked on the door of a room and asked 'is there any party going on inside', at which the man sitting inside opened the door in anger
 baat badhati chali gai or asaata ne pistol dikhaai or tantaani main usee ke pet main goli lag gai
 Asata says that after eating the pill in the stomach, she never got scared of the pill again
 internet par maujuud jaankariyon ke mutabik 1971 main america ke ek hotel main lut ke uddeshy se ghusi asaata ne ek kamare kaa darwaja khatkhataate hue poocha ki 'kya andar koi party chal rahi he', jis par andar baithe aadmi ne gussa main daravaaza kholaa
 The talk went on and Asata showed a pistol and Tantani was shot in his stomach
 asaata kahati he ki pet main goli ko khaane ke baad use phir kabhi bhi goli se dar nahin laga
