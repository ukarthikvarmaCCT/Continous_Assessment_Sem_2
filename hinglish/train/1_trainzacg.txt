 a post shared by Sonakshi Sinha (@aslisona) on Mar 13, 2018 at 12:27am PDT Shri Krishna incarnation is the full circle of Lord Vishnu
 ye rup jahaan dharm or nyaay kaa suchak he vahiin isamen apaar prem bhi he
 Every incident related to Shri Krishna avatar and every leela is unique
 shrikrishna ke mohak rup kaa varnak kai dharmik granthon main kiya gaya he
 a crown on the head, peacock feathers in the crown, a garland of peetambara, flute and veyjayanti
 aise adbhoot rup ko jo ekbar dekh letaa tha, wo usee kaa das banakar rah jaataa tha
 We all know that Shri Krishna loved milk, curd and butter, but apart from that he also loved a lot
 shrikrishna ko in paanch chizon se vishesh lagaav tha
 Today, on the occasion of Janmashtami, any devotee who puts these five things in front of God and prays for him sincerely, bal-gopal Kanhaiya fulfills his wish
 1
 The flute is very much loved by Shri Krishna
 ek chand main to radha ne shrikrishna kii bansuri ke bhagya ko apane bhagya se kahin shreshth bataaya he kyonki wo unke adharon ko chooti he
 After listening to the sweet melody of Shri Krishna's flute, all the gopis, gwal-bal, cows, fauna, trees and creeks used to stop
 bansuri saralata or mithaas kaa pratik he
 While decorating the idol of Shri Krishna on the occasion of Janmashtami, do not forget to keep the flute
 2
 Morpankha Bhagwan Shri Krishna wears a peacock in his crown
 mor pankh sammohan or bhavyata kaa pratik he
 It is a sign of happiness in life by removing sorrows
 kanha ke mukut kii sajaavat mor pankh ke bina adhuri he
 3
 mishri kii mithaskrishna ko maakhan mishri bahut hi priy he
 Mishri is a symbol of sweetness
 jivan main mithaas kaa hona behad jaruri he
 Shri Krishna always taught to love
 prem har us cheez se jo hamaare ird-gird maujuud he
 4
 vaijayanti kii malabhagwan shrikrishna apane gale main sadaiv vaijayanti kii maala dhaaran kiye rahete hai
 Don't forget Shri Krishna's veneration of Vyjayanti during the time of worship
 5
 Pitamber and Sandalwood's Tilakashikrishna always wore Pitamber

 Devote sandalwood to them before worshiping the Lord

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has once again targeted the BJP
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana ke kaaryakari sampadak sanjay raut ko die intervyuu main unhone kaha ki aaj bijepi kii raajnneeti satta ke ird-gird gumti he
 He also questioned the ideology of the BJP
 iske alaava uddhav thakare ne mob linching or goraksha jaise muddon par bhi bijepi ko nishane par liya
 Has also raised questions about Hindutva
 unhone kaha ki balasaheb thakare jis hindutv kii baat karte the, wo shivaji maharaj kaa hindutv tha, lekin pichley teen saal se desh main jo hindutv kaa unmaad chadha he, wo sahi nahin he
 This interview of Uddhav Thackeray came amid reports of a rift in the relations between Shiv Sena and BJP
 padhie ki aakhir uddhav thakare ne kin muddon par kya kaha
 
 
 
 
 What do you think about the news that is going on in Sanjay raut-tv and print media nowadays? Uddhav thackeray-my grandfather and Shiv Sena Pramukh used to tell us one thing, which they have also told you that the news should always be like news
 usamen na opinian hona chahie or na hi coment
 If you want to make an opinion or comment, then write an editorial article on that news the other day
 khabar hameshaa khabar jaisi likhi jaae, lekin kai baar khabare sampadakeey jaisi lagati he
 Raut - You have not got any title like Padma Shri and Padmavibhushan
 phir bhi pichley kuch dinon se aapke mitra paksh ke netaa aapako alag-alag oopaadhiyaan de rahe hai?thakare -mujhe unase koi oopaadhi nahin chahie
 Raut - How did you feel when you were called Bandra's don and mafia many times? Thackeray - Now let it be a fun too
 raut -jab aapako aisi oopaadhiyaan di jaati hai, to kaisaa lagata he?thakare -meri salaah yahi he ki duusare kii chatukaarita karne se acha he ki ham khud bos bane
 If i think that i am the boss of others who are laughable, i enjoy it
 raut -aap ek badi party kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 Recently, Raj Thackeray made your cartoons
 kya aapane unako dekha he?uddhav thakare -wo kahin pradarshit nahin hua he
 This picture has not come before me
 raut -narayan rane ke bijepi ke saath jane par aapkaa kya kahana he?thakare -meri shubhakamanaayen unke saath hai
 Why did raut-bhagwanbal send you sweets after coming out of jail? This is the same Bhujbal who troubled Balasaheb after leaving the Shiv Sena
 thakare- agar unamem apane anubhavon se mithaapan aayaa he, to main kya karun
 Raut- Raj Thackeray broke your councilors, what do you have to say on this? Uddhav Thackeray - Shiv Sena has not been formed by breaking anyone
 shivasena kii sthapana isi naam se hui, aaj bhi yahi naam he or kal bhi yahi rahegaa
 The Shiv Sena never made a name by breaking its name, leader and mark
 manase shivasena ke logon ko todakar le gai or phir wo waapas aa gaye, to unako kya phayda hua
 raut-bjp was an ideological party, but in 2014, several leaders of Congress and NCP joined it, who were of different views
 kya isi vajah se bijepi kaa rukh badal gaya he?thakare- bijepi main shivasena ke bhi kuch netaaon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The new politics that BJP has started revolves around power
 bijepi jin bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko lagaakar satta main ai, wo ajtak sabit nahin hui
 BJP is still making only allegations
 raut-kya maharashtra main sinchai ghotaalaa hua?thakare -abhi do din pehle maharashtra main sinchai ke liye sava lakh karod rupee die gaye
 This means that the money that was given earlier for irrigation went away, that is, they have no trespass
 ab yah rakam kaise or kisko banti jaaegi, yah to vakt hi batayega
 The question is also whether this money will really be used for irrigation
 raut -aap bijepi ke saath satta main shaamil hai or aapaki party ke paas achche mantralay hai, to in chaar varshon main aapane kitna kamaaya?thakare -main kamaane ke liye raajnneeti nahin karata hum
 If you are asking what i have earned, then i want to say that we have gained the experience of running the government in these four years

 paresh rawal ne kaha tha ki modi ke kirdaar ke liye wo sabase behatar hai
 Recently, after the first look was revealed, people on Twitter also disliked Vivek as Modi
 ab film ke duusare mahatvapurn kirdaar yani amit shah ko lekar bhi logon kii raay kuch aisi hi he
 In the Narendra Modi biopic, actor Manoj Joshi, who is known for playing the role of BJP President Amit Shah, has been finalized

 There is talk of Narendra Modi biopic being released before the Lok Sabha elections
 film kaa nirdesan omang kumaar kar rahe hai
 Omung has earlier produced biopic films like Mary Kom and Sarabjit
 film main jarina wahaab, prashanth narayanan, boman irani, barkhaa bisht sengupta, darshan kumaar, akshat aar
 Stars like Saluja, Anjan Srivastava, Rajendra Gupta and Yatin Karyekar are in the lead roles
 modi sarkaar ne desh ke karodon garibon ko muft ilaaj ke liye ayushmaan jaisi mahatvakankshi yojana shuru kii he, lekin sach to yah he ki desh main chikitsa seva kii sehat khud kharaab he
 There is an acute shortage of hospitals, infrastructure and doctors
 chamaki bukhaar se 100 se zyada bacchon ke marane kii bhayaavah ghatana yah sabit karti he ki swasthya vyavastha main amul badlaav kiye bina koi bhi ilaaj vyavastha kargar nahin ho sakati he
 In the interim budget, the government has allocated Rs 63,298 crore for the health sector, but it is inadequate in terms of the needs of the health sector
 isliye yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki modi sarkaar 2
 In the first budget of 0, whether the Finance Minister takes any major step to make a complete change in this sector
 antarim bajet main upeksha!farvari main antarim bajet pesh karte hue kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne apane bhaashan main swasthya kshetra kii khaas charchaa nahin kii
 Only the people benefiting from Ayushman Bharat and the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Center were talked about
 haryana main ek nae ames kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 However, the budget for the health sector has been increased to Rs 63,298 crore, of which a budget of Rs 6,400 crore has been released for Ayushman Bharat
 varsh 2018-19 main swasthya ke liye 52,800 karod rupee ke bajet nirdhaarit tha
 PM Modi spends on health sector 1 of GDP by 2025
 02 fisadi se badhaakar 2
 a target of 5 percent has been set
 haalanki, duusare deshon ke aankadon ko dekhen to yah lakshya bhi koi bahut prabhavit karne vaala nahin dikhataa
 Actually the health sector needs booster dose and this can be expected from the strong Modi government
 bhutan bhi hamase behatargauratlab he ki neshnal health profile ke mutabik bharat swasthya kshetra par jidipi kaa mahaj 1
 Spends 02%, while Bhutan more than us (2
 5%) or srilanka (1
 6%) such as neighboring countries spend
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke aankade daraane vaali tasviir dikhaate hai
 According to them, one-third of people practicing as allopathic doctors in India do not have medical degrees
 medical council of india ke paas varsh 2017 tak kul 10
 41 lakh doctors were registered
 inamen se sarkari aspataalon main 1
 There were 2 lakh doctors
 shesh doctor nijee aspataalon main karyrat hai athwa apni nijee practice karte hai
 About 90 crore population in rural areas depend on these few doctors for health care
 ieme ke mutabik, is asaamaanya anupaat kii vajah se haal yah he ki kahin-kahin aspataalon main ek bed par do marijon ko rakhana padataa he to kahin galiyare main marij lite hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 On the other hand, there are a lot of workload on those who are doctors
 peedblusi kii ek report ke anusaar pichley ek dashak main kareeb 1 lakh aspataal bed jode gaye hai, lekin yah zyaadaatar nijee kshetra ke hai or jaruraton ke hisaab se naakaafi hai
 The public sector contributes only about 30 per cent of the total expenditure in the health sector
 brazil main yah 46 fisadi, china main 56 fisadi, indonesia main 39 fisadi, america main 48 fisadi or britain main 83 fisadi he
 Fewer doctors, fewer medical colleges: There are about 470 medical colleges in the country
 inamen se 230 sarkari or 240 privet hai
 Two-thirds of the private medical colleges are in South India
 bharat main na to paryaapt aspataal hai, na doctor, na nurse or na hi saarvajanik swasthya karmchaaree
 There is a big difference in the quality and availability of health care
 yah antar keval rajyon ke bich nahin he, balki shahari or gramin kshetron main bhi he
 In the previous Modi government, it was announced to open 24 new medical colleges in unreserved areas
 sarkari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki nae medical college kholane ke alaava 2020-21 tak snaatak or snatakottar kii 18058 siton main vruddhi hogi
 According to an estimate, around 55 thousand MBBS passes in a year
 pehle ke hisaab se ye 55 hajaar embibies saare kaam kar sakate the, lekin ab ve kanoonee taur aisa nahin kar sakate
 Now we have to depend on the post graduate doctor
 post graduate seat kareeb 30 hajaar hi hai
 That is, out of 55 thousand MBBS, 25 thousand will not have expertise, they will remain as junior residents only
 junior residents keval marij kaa muyna kar saktaa he
 The question-makers raised by the glittering fever say that Ayushman Bharat is a great plan in terms of poor access to the health sector services and economy, but the most important is to repair the entire infrastructure of the health sector
 kyonki bihar, upi ke inseflitis se peedit bacchon ke liye ayushmaan jaisi yojanaayen nahin balki behtareen swasthya dhaancha jaruri he
 a special center has been set up at Gorakhpur Medical College for the treatment of encephalitis, but similar centers will also have to be built in Muzaffarpur or other afflicted areas of Bihar
 isliye is baar bajet par sabaki najar hogi ki vitt mantri is khatarnaak ho chuki beemaari se nipatane ke liye kya ghoshnaa karti hai

 sibar city gurugram ne pradooshan ke saare ricard tod die hai
 Gurugram has now become the most polluted city in Delhi NCR
 pichley hafte gurugram kaa air quality index 246 rahaa
 This is the third time in a month that Gurugram has been ranked number one in all cities of Delhi NCR
 beete hafte dilli kaa air quality index 203 rahaa, jabaki noida kaa 212 or gajiabad kaa 216 rahaa

 What is the problem? The biggest problem of this city is construction in the open
 sibar city har din badhata shahar he, badi-badi multinational companiyaan or hai rising socity isaki pahchaan he
 Due to which, construction work is going on somewhere on the day
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki yahaan construction site par kisi bhi tarah ke niyam kaa paalan nahin hota
 Aajtak found that in the most posh areas of Gurugram (where a construction site was seen after every third house within a radius of 3 km), construction was going on in the open
 ret-baaluu or duusare construction material khule main pade the, jinase dhul kaa gubbaar uth rahaa tha
 According to the guidelines of the NGT, wherever the houses are being built, the area should be covered
 construction material bhi dhakaa hona chahie or un par lagaataar pani kaa chhidkaav hona chahie
 But in Gurugram, construction work is going on continuously keeping all the rules and regulations on hold
 badi-badi imaaraten hon yaa sadakon par chalata fliover kaa nirmaan kaary, gurugram main kya sarkari or kya gaiyr sarkari, sabhi ne NGT ke niyamon kii dhajjiyaan uda di hai
 The most surprising thing that was seen in our investigation was that construction materials are also being sold in residential areas in Gurugram
 ret-baaluu kaa tila jagah-jagah rakhkar hospital, skool or societes ke aas paas benche ja rahe hai or koi rokane vaala nahin he

 buildings, societes, rwas or multinational companiyon se nikalne vaale hajaaron ton kooday ko yaa to jagah-jagah khaali padi zameenon par daal diya jaataa he yaa phir jala diya jaataa he
 Due to which the smoke emitted is high in carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and other harmful gases
 aisi landphil site gurugram main skulon or posh societes ke aas paas ek aam nazaaraa he

 Fiza's death has become a complicated puzzle that the police are facing every day with some sensational revelations in the process of solving it
 police ko ab tak ye nahin pataa ki phiza kii maut kaise hui? wo anjaane main maut ko khud gale laga baithi yaa usne aatmahatya kii? yaa phir wo kisi badi saazish kaa shikaar ho gai? iske upar phiza ke ghar se mili karodon kii daulat ne phiza kii maut ko or bhi zyada gaharaa diya he
 The death of Anuradha Bali alias Fiza, which once became a storm in Haryana's politics, has now become a complicated puzzle, which the police are facing every day with some sensational revelations
 police ko ab tak yahi nahin pataa ki phiza kii maut kaise hui? wo anjaane main maut ko khud gale laga baithi yaa usne aatmahatya kii? yaa phir wo kisi badi sajeesh kaa shikaar ho gai?haryana ke purv up mukhyamantri chandramohan se talaak ke baad bangale main tanhai kii zindagi guzaar rahi phiza ke ghar se karod rupye cash mili or karodon kaa khajaana mila sone or chaandi ke gahanon ke rup main
 The most shocking aspect of the wealth from Fiza's house is that someone else was looting this wealth on him
 koi tha, jo phiza ke paas noton ke bandal pahunchaa rahaa tha wo bhi naam or telephone number ke saath
 This suspense was further entangled with the secure SMS in Fiza's mobile phone, which was the intention behind looting money on Fiza
 ek purv rajaneta kii talakshuda patni ko alag-alag numberon se romantic esemes bheje ja rahe the
 Now, with the death of Fiza, the police is trying to solve the mystery of how many people were stuck on Fiza? The names of people whose names have come out from Fiza's mobile phone and bundles of notes, and how many people like them, breathed this Stuck thinking that Fiza has locked all the secrets in the locker
 maut se thik pehle phiza kaa mobile phone switch of tha or jab police ne maut kii gutthi sulajhane ke liye phiza kaa mobile on kiya, to uske massez box main mili kai romantic miseges
 Fiza's old friends say that she had changed a lot since the Chand Muhammad episode
 wo sirf unheen logon se milti thi, jinke saath phone par apwantment fiks hota tha
 The police began to search Fiza's mobile phone, filled with romantic SMS, to know the list of the same people
 phiza ke mobile phone par kai prem sandeshon vaale darjanon esemes aae the
 These sms were not from any one person, but different people had expressed their love for Fiza by sending sms, but the most surprising thing is that these were not ordinary people sending messages
 phiza ke teen mobile phone main mili romantic esemes bhejne waalon main kai bade rasukhdaar log shaamil hai
 It was not a big deal to have the names and numbers of big celebrities in Fiza's mobile
 ye sabko pataa tha ki punjab or haryana main satta ke galiyaaron main uski oonchi pahunch rahi he, lekin is sawaal ne police ke hosh uda die hai ki aakhir badi-badi hastiyon ne phiza par dore daalane kii koshish kyon kii? mobile phone ke alaava phiza ke ghar se mili sidi main bhi kai esemes mili hai
 Since the SMS found in the mobile phone is connected to high profile people, the police is taking steps to blow up
 haalanki jaanch se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki phiza se jitne logon kaa bhi kisi naa kisi tarah se taalluk rahaa he, un sabase poochtacha kii jaaegi
 Four days after Fiza's corpse was found, when the police did not find any solid evidence, the police again searched Fiza's house, then the police got just one and a half kg of gold and 92 kg of cash from Fiza's house
 More silver jewelery was also found
 ab yahi karodon kii daulat police ke liye ek raaj ban kar rah gai he
 Police have found the names and mobile numbers of some people written on bundles of notes found from Fiza's house, for example, on a deck of 500 some Sachin's name and mobile number
 police abhi yahi maan kar chal rahi he ki sachin ne hi phiza ko 50 hajaar rupee diye the lekin ye sachin koun he or phiza ko usne itani moti rakam kyon di, iskaa jawaab police ke paas abhi nahin he
 Similarly, Davinder's name is written on a deck of one lakh rupees
 ab police ko yah pataa lagaana he ki ye koun log hai, jo phiza par daulat lutaa rahe the? police ko ye bhi nahin pataa ki noton ke bandal par naam or number kisne or kyon likhe
 The recovery of such wealth has raised many questions in front of the police
 phiza pichley kai saalon se kahin naukari nahin kar rahi thim, phir unke paas itani daulat kahaan se ai
 Fiza does not have any business, so where did the gold and cash of crores come from home
 kya is daulat kaa vaasta kaali kamai se he
 According to sources, the police has prepared a list of those who gave money to Fiza and now she is preparing for all these inquiries
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki kya in logon se poochtacha ke baad phiza ke ghar se mili karodon kii daulat ke upar pade raaj kaa pardaa uth paaegaa yaa nahin
 This ruckus of notes raised from Fiza's bungalow may create another new storm in the coming days, as the police are now eyeing three bank lockers of Fiza
 police phiza ke bank lowers khulwaane vaali he, wo bhi inakam tex afasaron kii maujuudagi main
 While the Mohali police were carrying Anuradha Bali alias Fiza's body for postmortem, at the same time Fiza's most shocking act came to light, the Mohali police received a complaint by post, in which Fiza's close friend and lawyer Dilip Mahajan alleged Fiza had taken his Scorpio car and is now threatening him instead of returning
 ambala-chandigarh hive par laavaaris car main mili is scorpiyo gaadi kaa anuraadhaa bali urf phiza se bada pechida naata he
 This was revealed when the police found a slip of a hospital in Chandigarh while searching the car
 wo parchi anuraadhaa bali ke naam kii thi
 Later it was revealed that this was the same vehicle that Fiza had asked for a loan from Dilip Mahajan
 phiza kii maut ke baad dilip mahajan kii gaadi to mil gai, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab police ke liye sirdard ban gaya ki jab phiza ke paas khud kii do-do gaadiyaan thim, to phir usne dilip mahajan kii gaadi kyon maangi, haalanki dilip mahajan ke chote bhai or phiza ke dost rohit kaa daawa he ki phiza pehle bhi lambii duuri kii yatra ke liye gaadi maangati thi or do-chaar din main lautaa bhi detii thi
 During their investigation, police have found the bank account of Anuradha Bali in SBI Bank of SCO No 19 of Sector 23
 lekin bank ke branch manager ke mutabik phiza urf anuraadhaa bali kaa unke bank main kai saalon se seaving acount he
 But there is no locker by his name in his branch
 darasal police phiza ke ghar se mili karodon kii daulat ke raaj par pade parde ko uthaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 And for this, many of Fiza's lockers are set to be opened, but this news has given sleep to many veterans of Punjab and Haryana and it may be that the secrets of many of these people in Fiza's bank lockers will also come out
 duusari taraf phiza ke mobile phone main mili esemes hai profile logon se jude hai, isliye police phoonk-phoonk kar kadam uthaa rahi he
 According to sources, all the people related to Fiza have been related in some way
 phiza kii maut ke baad jis tarah ke khulaase ho rahe hai, use dekhte hue police ko bhi lagane laga he ki bank lowers main koi bada suraag mil saktaa he
 However, no one knows whether the clues from the lockers will solve the mystery of Fiza's death or bring out some other tricky aspect of this complicated case

 His captaincy has been questioned by former Australian batsman and Kolkata Knight Riders batting coach Simon Katich
 katich kaa maananaa he ki viraat kohli ek captain ke taur par abhi bhi sikh rahe hai
 Katich said this before the match between Kolkata and Kohli's team Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday
 katis ne kaha, 'main nahin jaanata ki vah ek group ko kis tarah se sambhalate hai
 He is probably still learning as a captain
 'purv austrailian ballebaaj ne kaha, 'aap ek mahaan khilaadi ho sakate hai, jo wo hai

 'kohli will get Dhoni's help, India has to play World Cup in England and Wales under Kohli's captaincy
 katich ne kaha ki kohli ek ballebaaj ke taur par shandaar hai
 He also said that in the World Cup starting May 30, Kohli has a player like Mahendra Singh Dhoni who will guide him
 baayen haath ke is purv ballebaaj ne kaha, 'ek khilaadi ke taur par vah sabhi kshetron main paripakv hai
 He is one of the greatest batsmen of all time
 isamen koi shaq nahin he
 As a captain he has things like passion and energy that he brings to the team
 vah jeetna chaahate hai or unke andar jeetne kii lalak he
 This is what a captain needs
 'unhone kaha, 'lekin, captaini isse kahin zyada he
 Getting the best out of the players, making the players feel comfortable, helping them succeed
 vah yah sab chijen vah mahaan captainon main se ek dhoni se sikh rahe hai
 Karthik's high praise for Kolkata captain Dinesh Karthik has been selected in the team for the World Cup
 katich ne karthik kaa number-4 ke sthaan ke liye samarthan kiya he
 He said, 'there is a lot of discussion about number-4
 karthik us tarah ke ballebaaj hai jo wicket par samay bitaana pasand karte hai
 Once they are set, they are difficult to bowl
 'unhone dinesh karthik kii tarif main kaside padhate hue kaha ki vishwa cap team main jagah pakki hone ke baad dinesh karthik ko ab ipel trophy hasil karne ke apane lakshya ko puraa karnaa chahie
 KKR captain Karthik has been selected in the Indian team for the World Cup, taking precedence over Rishabh Pant
 katich ne kaha, 'vah (karthik) urja se bharaa rahata he
 Now he should focus on achieving his real goal trophy
 unhone kaha, 'aapako jab tak safalataa nahin milti or aap khitaab hasil nahin karte tab tak aapako vishwaas nahin hota ki aap behtareen netritvkarta hai

 There is a lot of discussion about the number four position and he is the kind of batsman who likes to spend time at the crease

 ' Since 2015, the Delhi High Court has rejected the petition of MP Jairam Ramesh challenging the amendment made in the PMLA i
e
 the anti-money laundering law
 dilli hoicourt ne is maamle main kisi bhi paksh se jawaab daakhil karne se inkaar kar diya or yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 The bench had reserved its verdict on February 27, after hearing a debate on behalf of the central government and MP Jairam Ramesh
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se adishnal solicytor general maninder acharya ne kaha tha ki yah vyavastha aaj se nahin balki 2015 se hi chal rahi he
 Why the issue has not been raised since then
 duusari baat yah ki yachikakarta jairam ramesh is tarah ke sanshodhan se khud peedit bhi nahin hai
 So, if the victim is raised this issue, then it could still be considered
 yachikakarta ko is mudde ko uthaane kaa koi adhikaar hi nahin he
 During the hearing, the Central Government in this case told the court that the amendments have been filed towards those who are close to the accused in the money laundering case
 isliye ise nirast kar diya janaa chahie
 While P
 Jairam Ramesh appeared on behalf of the lawyer P
P
 chidambaram ne court ko bataaya ki maujuuda sarkaar se pehle piemele main kisi tarah kaa sanshodhan saadhaaran vidheyak ke jariye kiya jaataa tha
 But the current government has amended it through the Money Bill
 jo sidhe taur par samvidhan kaa ulanghan he
 Chidambaram told the court that the money bill is introduced only in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha na to ise khaarij kar sakati he or na hi isamen sanshodhan kar sakati he, rajyasabha sirf sifarish kar sakati he jise loksabhaa chaahe to sweekaar kare yaa asweekaar kar de
 Hence the amendment done in this way is a violation of the constitution and should be repealed
 chidambaram kaa tark tha ki ye samvidhan ke anuchhed 110 ke mutabik dhan vidheyak ke praavdhaanon se sambandhit hi nahin he
 Amending the law through the Money Bill is like ignoring the Rajya Sabha
 donon sadanon main kisi sanshodhan ko pesh kiya janaa samvidhan ke mul dhaanche kaa amuly hissaa he
 But P
 chidambaram ke tarkon or jairam ramesh kii arji par kisi tarah kaa koi relif dene ke bajaae court ne is yachika ko hi khaarij kar diya he
 Plants are very important for our life

 holi vaaki badi raahat lekar ai
 Many years later, Tempo was taken from Jhansi railway station to the bus stand
 idhar pad gai chunavi lat ke kaaran baithte hi auto vaale se poocha kya maahaul he
 He gave an exact vision - it is just a month
 bas, ye aadha vaakya dimag main raajnneetik uthapatak ko shant karne ke liye sanjivani sa kaam karata rahaa holi kii doj tak
 Just after walking on the highway going from Jhansi to Khajuraho, Palash trees were seen but the flowers of Palash were missing
 bhare phaguna main ye surkh rang kya uda jaise bundelkhand kaa suhaag ujaad gaya he
 Ever since Palashmayi began to see nature, it was the first time that Palash was not there
 pichley saal isi mausam kii orchha kii drushyavali ankhon par aaj tak kabja kiye he
 The mind was waiting to see the scene ahead of him
 poocha to pataa chalaa ki bin foole palash usee bemausam barish or olon kaa asar hai, jinhone rabi kii fasal kii band baja rakhi he
 These hail devastated Palash and razed the standing crop in the fields
 ghar pahunchaa to akhabaaron main kisaanon kii khudakushi kii khabar padhi
 By the way, it has become a habit to read such news, and to be honest, the heart has become a bit harsh towards them
 mahoba se ek khabar thi ki ek kisaan khet par gaya or vahaan chaupat fasal dekar uski tabiyat aisi bigadi ki phir aspataal se uski maiyat hi uthi
 But what about us? Our salary arrives in the bank on time
 bhai-band sab holi par ghar aae the
 Gradually the color began to freeze
 hormonia, dholak, jhanjh majira baahar nikal aae or phag gabi
 We are of that country anyway, both Kya Phag and Kya Diwari are sung first and played or celebrated after that
 sach to ye he ki ye tyohaar se zyada gayan kii swatantra lok vidhaon ke taur par ubhare hai
 It is also interesting to note that both the song genres are not bonded to religion in their songs despite being connected to religion
 phag main agar isuri shringaar ras piro gaye hai to diwari main rahim or tulsi sab sunai dete hai
 When it was night, fire was brought from Holi burning in Divanju
 divanju yani dewan hardaul
 And the winds means down
 yani dewan hardaul ju ke chabutare ke paas se ye aag laai gai
 Hardaul has become the newest and most revered deity in Bundelkhand's history
 sucraat ne agar abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke liye jehar kaa pyaalaa piya tha to hardaul ne rishton kii pavitrataa sabit karne ke liye koi 350 saal pehle yahi kaam kiya tha
 However, the fire reached the house, under the condition that Holi fire was the permanent settlement to illuminate the houses and smother the stoves throughout the year
 maa ne gaay ke gobar ke barulon kii maala kaa is aag se milan karaayaa or ghar main bhi holi jal uthi
 Holi was worshiped by Gulal
 or raat main hi rang udaye lage
 The next day, Holi continued
 yahaan holi se itani jaldi man nahin bharta, isliye pehle din keechad vaali or doj ke din rangon kii holi hoti he
 However, the reality of this time is that both days there was a glut of cheap Gulal in the city
 jab rangon kii umang chadhi to tay hua ki matadin ke kuen par holi kii daavat ho
 Matadin is a dusky 18–20-year-old Dalit boy
 badi vinay se muskuraataa he to puraa cheharaa dantakanti se jagamag ho jaataa he
 Today the arrangement was with him and the king took the responsibility to support
 raja bhi isi umr kaa he
 Sings well and wants to be a singer
 pasmanda musalmaan he or ghar kii mali haalat kharaab he, isliye barhon maheene koi nayaa rojgaar kar ghar chalaata he, lekin pucho to sabase pehle gayak banane kii baat karata he
 Anuj Sunit asked for flour for one and a half dozen people, so i really understood why the student should commit homicide
 aakhir ghar se niklaa tabhi to aate daal kaa bhav jaan sakaa
 After two hours of effort, thick Gakkad, Brinjal Bharta, Bundi Raita, Fluffy Chutney to the tongue and later Imrati sweets came out
 kuen ke paas karasdev kaa chabutara he
 For a long time i was sitting there waiting for food
 karasdev graphjanon khaskar pashupalkon ke devtaa hai
 When Dhaka is played at night on this platform, it will be reminiscent of the first interventions of humans in its lovely threatening nature
 dhak kii aawaaj jitani dur se aati he, utani hi gahari lagati he
 The style of Dhaka playing is perhaps the easiest among the avanadas, but its simplicity is compelling
 bhojan shuru ho gaya
 Hardly anyone has gone beyond two and a half Gakkad
 pet main ann jate hi dhai ghante kaa intjaar or susti dur hone lagi
 When drinking water and washing hands, Gulal came out of the sack again and started raining at each other
 matadin ke khet main matar ke puure rakhe hai
 Chana is definitely a bit behind, but expected
 kisaan parrast he, lekin hataash nahin he
 Everyone played Holi in the hope that colors should live, life should remain alive
 phaguni hawa aise hi bahati rahegi to is baar na sahi agali baar acchhee fasal hogi
 This hope is called life
 uttar pradesh chunaavon ke maddenjar bolte hue bijepi ke senior leader yogi adityanath ne kaha ki sabaki samruddhi or sabhi kii suraksha chunaav ke andar hamaara mudda rahegaa
 Adityanath said that with everyone, development of all will be our issue
 vahiin pashchimi uttar pradesh main ho rahe palaayan par yogi adityanath bole ki sabhi ko sachai ko sweekaar karnaa chahie, kairana or aasapaas ke kai jilon main bahut se logon kaa palaayan hua he
 Everyone should accept this matter honestly, while action should be taken against such elements which have caused all this
 unhone kaha ki kashmir ek din main hi nahin hua he, sangathit aparaadh satta kaa sangrakshan praapt karata he phir baad main vah aam logon ko palaayan ke liye majaboor karata he
 In western Uttar Pradesh, SP-BSP has created such situations in the last 15 years due to which people are forced to flee
 aise tatwon ko sarankshan diya ja rahaa he unako tikat diya ja rahaa he vahi log satta main jaaenge to kya karenge
 This will make the situation worse
 isliye iske liye abhi se aawaaj uthaani chahie or karrwai honi chahie
 All these things are meant to make the public aware and not to increase votes
 ram mandir parayogi adityanathbhole ki bhavy ram mandir banakar rahegaa lekin sanvaidhanik daayre ke hisaab se iskaa nirmaan hoga
 As far as becoming the Chief Minister is concerned, there are many faces in our party, only a BJP worker will become the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh

 unhone kaha, "rajya ke grahamantri ne mandsaur ke kisaanon par goli chalane kii ghatana ko sahi tehraaya diya, yah to ham sweekaar nahin kar sakate, vahiin van mantri ne bayaan de diya ki 'narmada kinare jo ped lagaae gaye vah sahi lagaae gaye, bhrashtachar nahin hua he
 i have walked 3100 km ', also find out how far they (forest minister) have walked
 yah to bhaajapa ko ek tarah se clinit hi de di, sawaal uthta he ki kya jarurat he mantri ko yah tay karne kii
 "while Digvijay Singh is dissatisfied with the responses of the ministers, on the other hand, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan says," He does not need anyone's clean chit
 mandsaur kii ghatana unke seene main fafole kii tarah he, koi bhi mukhyamantri nahin chahta ki uske kaal main aisa ho, magar kai baar paristhitiyaan aisi banati hai ki aisi ghatana ho jaati he
 "on the government's response to the Mandsaur firing, Congress General Secretary and MP Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted on Tuesday," The injustice done to our farmers in the Mandsaur firing was extremely shameful
 ham sunishchit karenge ki hamaare kisaan bhaaiyon ko nyaay mili or golicond ke doshi adhikariyon par sakht karrwai ho

 australian ballebaaz jo burns ne daawa kiya he ki sidney test ke aakhri din spinners kaa role ahm rahegaa
 Of course, he hopes that the most successful bowler of the series, Nathan Lyon (21 wickets so far), will remain impressive on the last day and Team India will come under pressure
 ise australian team kaa mind game bhi samajha ja saktaa he, lekin yah bhi sahi he ki pich par spinneron ko madad milane lagi he
 On the fourth day, Nathan Lyon took one wicket in his name, while Ravichandran Ashwin took four wickets for 105 runs in 19 overs

 This is the squeeze of the two-round meeting of the bjp's top-tier Sankatmochan Group, which is in the heat of the Madhya Pradesh Vocational Examination Board (vyapam) recruitment scam
 ab tak is maamle ko rajya str par nibatane kii koshish main lage mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii kursi ab puri tarah se alaakaman kii dayaa par nirbhar ho gai he
 Although handing over the case to the CBI without any comment by the Supreme Court brought immediate relief for Chauhan, the BJP high command gave Chauhan a grant
 lekin abhi tak prashasnic mushkil main ghire mukhyamantri ab virodhiyon ke saath-saath party kii andruni raajnneeti main bhi ghir gaye hai
 Chauhan, who has been established as a satrap in the politics of the state, may occupy the chief minister's chair but he will have to take the green signal of the high command on every matter related to Vyapam and the development agenda to be adopted to improve the image
 haalanki rashtriya upaadhyaksh or rajya bijepi ke prabharee vinay sahasrabuddhe india today se baatcheet main kehete hai, “vyapam ke maamle main prashasnic nirbalata saamne ai he
 It is not the Congress, but the BJP government that has exposed the matter and the Chief Minister himself decided to get to the bottom of the matter and punish the culprits
 isamen bijepi ke bhi kuch netaa pakade gaye, phir bhi kadam peeche nahin khinche
 But we believe that in the meantime, due to some suspicious deaths in the 15-20 days, there was a lot of controversy in the media, which created a crisis of concept before us
 ” ve yah bhi kehete hai, “is maamle main hamaari vishwasaneeyata kisi apradhi ko kanoon ke saamne dandit karne kii patibaddhta or prakharata se aegi or usee madhyam se hamaare prati bani galat avadharana kaa ham muqabla kar paaenge
 "the death, the series of meetings here
 After the continuous death of the people involved in the business, the deaths of journalists and investigative officers hanged swords on the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government of Madhya Pradesh, then BJP President Amit Shah, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister
 Arun Jaitley and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj had a long discussion about the political side effects of this scam
 is baithak ke baad vyapam kii puri nigaraanee ab kendriya netritv ne sambhaal lee he
 On July 6, Shah also held a meeting with state BJP in-charge and national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and organization general secretary Ramlal on the issue, which outlined the roadmap for early implementation of decisions taken at the top-level meetings
 is baithak main tele conferencing ke jariye mukhyamantri ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 However, no one from the central leadership in this matter officially came to the rescue of Chauhan
 lekin sutron ke mutabik, chouhan kii sari daleelon par vichaar ke baad khud shah ne unhen nirdesh diya, “is maamle se jude jin-jin logon ko bhay he or ve suraksha kii maang kar rahe hai to sarkaar unhen fouran suraksha muhaiyaa karaae or yah sunishchit kare ki koi maut na ho
 "changes will be made to improve the image now
 Taking charge of correcting the concept against the state government, the BJP high command has mainly directed the government to make three administrative changes
" pehla yah ki pariksha tantra main nai takneekon kaa istemaal kar vyapak badlaav kiya jaae taaki nakal karne yaa uttar pustika badalakar hone vaali dhaandhlee ko roka ja sake
 In checking the answer sheet, the front page should be removed before the check so that there is no rigging during the investigation
 iske saath hi party ne chouhan sarkaar ko suzav diya he ki vishvavidhyalay kii parikshaayen amuman prashn bank ke aadhaar par hoti hai
 Provision should also be made to change the number of questions in different classes so that there is no duplication in the class
 lekin sabase ahm nirdesh yah diya gaya he ki mukhyamantri chouhan khud rajya maanavadhikaar ayog or mahila ayog ko ek chitthee likhakar yah apil karen ki jitne logon kii abhi tak maut hui he uski jaanch kar le
 a senior BJP leader argues that even though he is an accused, despite being jailed, he has human rights and whether it has been violated or not, it is done away with by the commission of inquiry to remove the concept against the government
 can be done
 saath hi is bhartee ghotaale ke aarope main jail main band logon kii jamaanat yachika par rajya sarkaar kii ore se koi aupchaarik virodh nahin karne kaa nirdesh bhi chouhan ko diya gaya he
 The BJP high command believes that the people in this case are not intentional or habitual criminals, so the government should not oppose the bail application
 is suzav ko lekar party kaa maananaa he ki aatmahatyaon kii pramukh vajah yuvaaon ko hiraasat main lene or baari sankhya main darj mukademon kii vajah se saamaajik-maansik aghat bhi he
 a leader involved in BJP meetings says that in most of the cases, students have also been booked for cheating under section 420, whereas in cases like cheating, it was not rational to impose this section
 aise chaatro ko peshewar apradhi nahin mana ja saktaa
 Due to the massive political misdemeanor scam on leadership change, the credibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who taunted the ethics during the BJP and Lok Sabha elections, has come down heavily and the party is in a dilemma over the leadership change in the state
 is sawaal par rajya bijepi ke prabharee vinay sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, “aaj kii taarikh main raaj” main netritv parivartan kii koi vajah nahin he
 "but according to sources, the bjp's Sankatmochan group took a deep churn in this matter
 sutron ke mutabik, is baithak main maujuud dastavejon or chouhan kii safai ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mahasoos kiya gaya ki vyapam ke maamle ko shivaraj puri tarah se samaj nahin paae
 After the first round of meeting, Rajnath Singh spoke to the Chief Minister over phone and verbally asked him to give a statement that the government has no objection if the High Court wants to conduct an inquiry with another agency
 rajnath ne khud bhi yah bayaan saarvajanik taur par diya
 The dilemma of the party leadership at that time was that the Supreme Court itself had expressed satisfaction over the STF investigation last year, so it would not be appropriate for the government to go ahead and declare a CBI inquiry directly
 lekin jab maamla niyantran se baahar jaataa dikhaa to sankatmochan samooh ne phir baithak kii or rajya sarkaar ko nirdesh diya gaya ki vah hycourt main khud aavedan dekar sibiai ko jaanch saunpane kii maang kare taaki is tufaan ko jald thama ja sake
 The party also discussed the change of leadership due to the increasing pressure of the opposition and the party's declining credibility, but there was no consensus on it, so at the moment it was agreed to leave the issue
 alaakaman kaa kaa maananaa he ki rajya main chunaav abhi kai saal dur hai or is bavandar ke thamane ke baad sarkaar agar puri tarah se vikaas ke agenda par eemaandaaree se focus kar de to sarkaar ke khilaaf bani avadharana ko durust kiya ja saktaa he
 But for this too, Shivraj will now be forced to work on the instructions of the central leadership
 bijepi kii mushkil yah he ki rajya main shivaraj ke mukaable kaa lokapriy cheharaa uske paas nahin he
 But the opposing counter of former Chief Minister and current Union Minister Uma Bharti had also increased the pressure on the high command
 haalanki ek varisht netaa uma ke rukh par kuch yon tippanee karte hai, “uma kaa swabhaav jagajaahir he, lekin is sankat kii ghadi main unhen sadhakar saath rakhana bhi hamaari majaburi he
 "but the way Uma stepped down from the post of Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in August 2004, her pains come up again and again in her mind
 bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar kaa maananaa he ki is vakt uma bharti puri tarah se narendra modi-shah camp main sharnaagat hokar der-saber 6, shyamala hills (mukhyamantri kaa aadhikarik awaas) kaa apana vanvaas khatm karnaa jarur chahengi
 But the way Shah has sent Kailash Vijayvargiya as general secretary, there is also speculation that the current leadership of BJP may make him an alternative to Shivraj in future
 lekin bijepi ke ek padaadhikari kaa kahana he ki aise main shivaraj ko sadhana mushkil hoga kyonki ve party ke khilaaf morcha khol sakate hai
 He says that the allegations of recommendations in Vyapam are also the work of activists
 aise main chouhan ke prati kaaryakartaaon kii sahanubhuti or badhegi
 He believes that uma-shivraj can also come together in the event of making Vijayavargiya the CM
 haalanki party main ek dhada yah bhi maan rahaa he ki agar amit shah adhyaksh pad par dobaaraa asin nahin hote hai to santhnik badlaav ke bahaane shivaraj ko dilli laayaa ja saktaa he
 a possibility is also being raised that if the CBI probe creates an atmosphere against Shivraj, he may be made a minister at the center by forcing him to relinquish the chief minister's post after the Bihar elections
 bijepi se badi mushkil main sanghamodi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone par mantriyon or khud shah ne gaaje-baaje ke saath kham thoka tha ki unhone bhrashtachar-ghotaalamukt shashan diya he
 But since then, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and now Vyapam scam scandal have increased the difficulties of the union-government-bjp
 sushamaa vivaad ko party jhel gai, raaje ke maamle main bhi bachaav main utari, lekin vyapam ke maamle main bachaav kaa koi aadhaar hi nahin bachaa tha
 a senior party leader expresses the Sangh's dilemma, "it is a challenge for the Sangh because so far it has handled the matter
" agar vah party main istife hone detaa he to wicket girane kii aisi shuruyaat hogi jise roak paanaa sangh ke liye aasaan nahin ho paaegaa or uski sthiti mookadarshak jaisi ho jaaegi
 "in such a situation, the Sangh will now have to decide whether it wants to be the moral guide of the BJP or to continue its role of political operator
 is maamle main pichley saal modi sarkaar ke gathan ke baad sangh ke sah sarkarywah suresh soni samet kuch anya netaaon kii kathith sanliptata kaa khulaasa hua to mukhyamantri or taatkaaleen bijepi pradesh adhyaksh narendra singh tomars se sangh bhi naaraaz ho gaya tha
 It is clear that this is a double challenge for Chauhan as he is now dependent on the mercy of the Sangh and BJP high command, so it is difficult to make BJP with the modi-shah era a party with distinction

 dilli main kareeb 2 lakh 93 hajaar lakh rashan card radd kiye jane ke food kamishnar ke faisle ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne badi sajeesh bataaya he
 The Chief Minister's Office issued a statement saying that the officials have canceled the ration cards sitting in their offices without going home and the Food Department has also completely ignored the minister's objections
 arvind kejariwal ne rashan card radd hone ke maamle main ab pradhanmantri par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He tweeted, 'modiji told Red Fort that he got 6 crore fake ration cards deducted
 modiji ke farji daawey kaa sach padhie
 The PMO forces the officers of Delhi to force the card to be cut
 modiji, aap desh sambhaaliye
 The country is not resting
 dilli main dakhsandaji band kiijie yaa phir PM chhodkar dilli ke CM ban jaaie
 'official statement of Kejriwal government - Since the officials do not report to the elected government of Delhi, they are working against the interests of the people of Delhi
 yah bahut gambhir vishay he
 The CM said that the Food Commissioner 2
 93 rashan card radd karne kaa faisla kar liya lekin is faisle se pehle field inspection nahin kiya gaya or na hi rashan card dharakon kaa paksh suna gaya
 How serious consequences can result from this decision has not been taken into consideration
 -mandavali main teen bacchon kii maut ke maamle se bhi adhikariyon ne koi sabak nahin liya he
 Ration cards have been canceled illegally and their ration has been taken away from the poor
 agar mandavali jaisi ghatana dilli ke duusare hisse main hoti he to iske liye puri tarah se food kamishnar jimmedaar honge
 In a note written on July 26, the Food Minister had sought the details of those card holders whose department was preparing to cancel the card
 lekin koi jaankaree nahin di gai or mantri ke nirdeshon kii dhajjiyaan udaate hue manamaane tareeke se rashan card radd kar die gaye
 According to the Chief Minister's Office, the verification should have been done earlier that between January to March 2018, how many people did not take ration and had to be verified and they should be given a chance to present their case
 keval daftaron main faisla karke rashan card radd kiya janaa bilkul galat faisla he
 CM said that due to internet connectivity problem, there was a problem in getting ration from e-pos machines

" garibon or jaruratmandon par dhyanahameshaa se agrani rahe loyola ne pichley dashak main shiksha ko lekar apane nazariye main badlaav kiya tha
 Once considered a college for upper class students, Loyola today is filled with a sense of pride by focusing on the poor and the needy
 srilankai or tibeti sharnaarthiyon ko daakhile dene ke alaava, college pehali peedi ke chaatro ko bhi mukhyadhara main laane ke prayaas kar rahaa he
 Says Muttumalai, "we have excellent faculty members and we use them to arrange that gaps in students in the first year of college on their previous education and achievements can be reduced

 aam aadmi party (AAP) kii purvi dilli kii ummidavaar aatishi ne bijepi ke gautam gambhir ke khilaaf do voter card rakhane kii ek aapraadhik shikaayat darj karai he
 He alleged that Gautam Gambhir had two separate voter cards from two different regions - Karol Bagh and Rajendra Nagar
 is sambandh main aatishi se chunaav ayog ke alaava court main maamla daayar kiya he
 This complaint has been lodged in Tis Hazari court under section 155 (2), demanding a police investigation into the case
 court ne aatishi ko court main pesh hokar is maamle se jude tamaam dastavej or bayaan darj karne ke liye 31 may ko court main hajir hone ke nirdesh die hai
 Apart from this, the court has also directed the Election Commission to present its documents before the court in this matter
 isse pehle dilli main bijepi kii tikat par loksabhaa chunaav lard rahe purv cricketer gautam gambhir ke do voter idi rakhane se jude maamle main tees hajaari court ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 It will be clear on May 23 that Atishi and Gautam Gambhir, who are contesting against each other from East Delhi, will be defeated
 lekin court main kiskaa palada baari rahegaa, isamen kai maheenon kaa samay court kii sunwaayee main lagegaa
 If the court appears satisfied on the basis of the documents and recorded statements presented by Atishi in the hearing on May 31, he can also summon Gautam Gambhir
 baharhaal, aatishi kaa kahana he ki janpratinidhitiv adhinium, 1950 kii dhara 17 ke anusaar, koi bhi vyakti do jagah se vot nahin de saktaa
 Under section 31, if a person enrolls in the voter list from two places, he can be punished for up to one year
 aatishi ne yah bhi kaha ki gambhir ne namakan ke samay riternig officer ko saunpe apane halafname main kaha he ki vah keval vidhansabha kshetra rajinder nagar -39, bhaag sankhya 43, serial number 285, ipiaisi number - esamem1357243 main matdaan karne ke liye panjikrut hai
 However, it is learned that Gambhir was also registered to vote in the Assembly Constituency Karol Bagh-23, Part Number 86, Serial Number 87, EPIC Number - RJN1616218
 aam aadmi party kii netaa ne kaha ki yah tathy jaanboojhkar apane namakan kii filing or chaanbin ke dauraan chhupaae gaye the, taaki riterning officer unke namakan ko asweekruti na kar de
 He said that the wrong information given in the electoral affidavit is also punishable under Section 125A of the said Act, which provides for a jail term of six months
 halafname main AAP ke ummidavaar dwaara aapatti jataae jane ke kaaran gambhir ke namakan ko roak diya gaya tha
 Atishi said that it is unfortunate for the public that a candidate who is not aware of the legal procedures was removed to take advantage of his stardom
 lekin isaki keemat party or ummidavaar ko chukaani padegi, kyonki use jail bhi ho sakati he

 Was Obama told that the Sangh is trying to dominate the new government and programs like Homecoming are going on across the country
 kya kisi ne obama ko bataaya ki apane mantriyon ke utapataang bayanon se khud pradhanmantri asahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Actually, the larger Hindu section of the country is unable to connect itself with the concept of a united Hindu nation
 haa, yah bhi sahi he ki soshal media par jo nae hindu dhvaj dharakon kii bheed ai he usase yah dharna banane kii koshish ho rahi he ki sara desh is hindu raashtra yaa sangh kii dhara ko maanata he
 But as Obama said, all the world's eyes are on the politics of India and religion
 yadi obama chaahate to yah kehane se batch bhi sakate the ki bharat dharm ke naam par na bante, yah uski tarakkee main baadhak he
 Perhaps one should not forget that this America which has awarded Narendra Modi titles from rock star to Bollywood star and Obama calls Modi as his personal friend, has given this Narendra Modi for years because of Gujarat riots Did not give visa
 dikkat yah he ki jab aap vishwa ke manch par dastak dete hai to duniya aapako is baat par bhi parakhti he ki aapke desh main dharm ke naam par kitni sahansheeltaa he
 But in recent times, riots have been opening up to what is going on and who is behind it, from love jihad to homecoming and the attack on the church in Delhi
 america or bharat main sabase badi samanta he ki donon kai jatiyon,kai dharmon,kai bhashaaon or vividh paramparaon vaale desh hai
 But there is a dispute about Biharis in Maharashtra
 tabhi yah sawaal uthta he ki ek desh ke rup main ham kitne sakasham hai, vishwa ke saamne ek udhaaharan prastut karne ke liye, yahi dwand he pradhanmantri ke saamne, kyonki ve ab apane aapako vishwa ke netaa or bharat ko us manch par laane kii chaah rakhte hai, jiskaa hakdaar bharat he, magar kahin na kahin dharm or jati aadhaarit raajnneeti hamaare vikaas par haaavee ho rahi he or jate-jate obama ne bhi isi kii yaad dilaai, lekin kya karen ram mandir ke naam par do siton se lekar satta tak kaa safar yah baar-baar yaad dilaataa rahata he ki dharm aadhaarit raajnneeti hamaari majaburi he, lekin yah bhi ek sachai he ki sangh bhi america ko pasand karata he, kyonki aatankwaad ke khilaaf duniyabar main chhidi jang kii aguwai america hi kar rahaa he or yah ladaai he kya? It is this fight, against Islam, which is acceptable to the Sangh and it also wants to stand together in this fight with America
 yahi nahin america or soviet sangh ke bich chal rahe cold waar ke dauraan bhi sangh america ke saath tha, kyonki sangh samaajwaad kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 Capitalism has been supportive, because a large section of the Union is associated with trade, which has no abstention from foreign capital

 "PM Modi's statements indicate that he is ready to play the 2024 innings as well

 This agenda can be fulfilled only while in power for a long time

 2024 ke liye unke paas nae mudde honge

 There is no information about the dog's name

 The truth is that the meaning of Zardari's visit to India has completely changed
 ek aisi yatra jo sirf ek nijee yatra maani ja rahi thi
 It is now gradually seen that the official travel limit is being crossed
 gaur kijiye is baat pe!pradhanmantri manmohan singh or raashtrapati zaradaari ke bich lunch par hone vaali mulaaqaat se pehle pradhanmantri ne ek mashvira diya jise pakistani paksh ne maan liya he, or wo tha manmohan or zaradaari ke bich kamare main van ON van mulaaqaat
 That means only Zardari and Manmohan are not there in the room! Not even the one who writes the notes
 saafe ho jaataa he ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh is maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaanaa chaahate hai bharat or pakistan ke rishton ko nayi disha dene ke liye! magar philhal sawaal yahi kiya ja rahaa he kikya he pradhanmantri ke zehan main?yah spasht he ke sara jordonon deshon ke vyapaarik sambandhon ko nayi dishadene par hoga, magar uske liye donon netaaon ko alag se milane kii kya zarurat? iske liye zamin pehle se hi taiyaar kii ja rahi he
 There is going to be a meeting between the Home Secretaries and Commerce Ministers of the two countries in the coming days, in which all these things will be considered
 is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane se pehle kuch or baton ko samajhane kii zarurat he! is vaqt zaradari ko pakistan kaa ek kamazor raashtrapati mana ja rahaa he
 The confrontation with the Pakistani Supreme Court and the rift with the army have made her situation very critical
 or pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi khud ko rajanithik taur par ghira hua mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Already, news of corruption allegations and confrontation with reputed institutions in the country has brought the current government into a vortex of controversies for which it may have to pay a big price politically
 to ek taraf kamajori or duusari taraf bebasii
 a political mix that would be considered the worst news for any diplomatic exchange
 magar usase pehle kuch or tathyon par gaur kijiye
 Zardari undoubtedly appears weak
 magar pakistan kii niyati kaa faisla karne vaali sena or iesai kii vishwasaneeyata or bhi dhoomil ho gayi he
 The army has suffered the biggest brunt of the incident of finding Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and killing him
 isse pehle pakistani avam sirf apane rajanetaaon ko nikamma maanati thi
 But after this incident, his endured trust in the army continued
 janata kaa ek bahut bada tabaka ab na sirf use america kaa pichhalggu maanata he
 In fact, the army has also brought the glory of infighting
 yah kahana atishyokti na hogi ki pakistan ke itihaas main sena kaa maujuuda seoup uski sabase kamazor or dishaheen vyavastha maani jaayegi
 Zardari is weak, but due to the absence of political options in Pakistan, what appears to be in his favor is TINA FACTOR
 yani ki abhi koi vikalp nahin or sena apni rahi sahi vishwasaneeyata pakistan kaa takhtapalat karke yaa us par dabaav daal ke khona nahin chaahegi
 Expectations are also being made from this ONE ON ONE visit, because its delicate shoulders do not carry the burden of excessive hype
 yahaan tak ki aisi mulakaaton se pehle jis tarah kii kootnithik sargarmi saooth blaak or pradhanmantri karyaalay main dikhaai detii he wo bhi nadaarad he
 Clearly, the two leaders want to keep the dialogue limited to themselves
 khabaren yah bhi mil rahi hai ki zaradaari is yatra se pehle sena pramukh or pradhanmantri gilaani se bhi vistrut charchaaen kar rahe hai
 It is clear that he will get the support of both these personalities
 kam se kam unhen yah to pataa hi hoga ki is yatra or usamen liye jane vaale faislon ko lekar unki lakshmana rekha kya hogi
 And democracy should do the same thing
 aisa lag rahaa he ki agar zaradaari ek kadam badhane ko taiyaar hai to bharat do kadam or badhegaa

 During the months of March to May this year, the pre-monsoon rains have fallen by 22%
 is giravat se ganna, subjiyon, falon or kapaas jaise fasalon ke utpaadan par vipareet asar pad saktaa he
 According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), only 75 between March 1 and May 15
 9 mili meter kii barish hui he, jabaki saamaanya barish 96
 8 millimeters is considered
 bijness standard ke mutabik 1 march se 24 april tak barish saamaanya se 27 fisadi tak kam hui
 This decline was observed in eastern and northeast India due to rainfall data
 haalanki, mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki dakshin-pashchim monsoon dakshin andaman sagar kii taraf bad rahaa he or dishaaen anukool hone kii vajah se yah agle do-teen din main uttar andaman sagar or andaman dweep tak pahunch saktaa he
 The South India office of the Meteorological Department has recorded a 46 per cent decrease in pre-monsoon rains, which is the biggest decline in the country
 iske baad 1 march se hi 24 april ke bich barish main uttar-pashchim sab divijan main saamaanya se 36 fisadi kam or uttar bharat main saamaanya se 38 fisadi kii kami dekhi gai he
 Eastern and Northeast India, such as Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha and Northeast, saw a seven percent decrease in pre-monsoon rains
 maharashtra, goa, chhattisgarh, gujarat or madhya pradesh jaise madhya kshetra main barish saamaanya rahi or isamen kami nahin ai
 However, in the period from March 1 to April 24, the central region also received five percent less rainfall than normal
 teevr lu kii vajah se marathavada kshetra ke kai baandhon main pani kaa sangrah shunya ke str par pahunch gaya he
 It is worth noting that pre-monsoon rains have great importance in the production of horticultural crops (like fruits and vegetables) in many parts of the country
 isi tarah purvottar ke kuch hisson or pashchimi ghat ke ilaakon main plantesan fasalon jaise chaay, coffee, rabar aadi ke liye bhi yah mahatvapurn hota he
 In states like Odisha, tillage is done only during the pre-monsoon season
 madhya bharat main ganna or kapaas jaisi fasalein sinchai par nirbhar hoti hai or inhen pre-monsoon barish se madad milti he
 Pre-monsoon rains are necessary for plantations like apples in the wooded areas of the Himalayas
 pre-monsoon barish kii vajah se jangalon main lagi aag bhi bujh jaati he

 pakistan pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne ummid ke anuroop sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main kashmir kaa raag alapa
 In the majority of his speech, he kept referring to Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki pakistan to bharat ke saath baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he lekin bharat par ''asweekaarya'' sharten ladane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Sharif raised the issue of violence in Kashmir, calling Hizbul Mujahideen killed terrorist Burhan Wani as the leader of the Kashmir movement
 navaj sharif ke bayaan kaa jawaab dete hue kaha bharat ke videsh rajyamantri emje akbar ne kaha ki vah ''uri hamale main pakistan kii bhoomika'' ko puri tarah se nakaarne main tule hai or aatanki burhan vaani kaa mahimamandan aatankwaad se pakistan ke judaav ko darshata he
 It is shameful to call Burhan Wani a leader and India is shocked by the praise of the terrorist
 akbar ne kaha, 'hamane ek aatankwaadi kaa mahimamandan suna
 Wani was the declared commander of the Hizbul, known as a terrorist group
 yah hairaan karne vaali baat he ki ek raashtra kaa netaa swa prachaarit aatankwaadi kaa is tarah ke manch par mahimamandan kar saktaa he
 This is a self accusation by the Pakistani Prime Minister
 ' At the same time, on the claim of Nawaz Sharif of continuous efforts for dialogue by taking additional steps by Pakistan, Akbar said, "we have not only shown the first step, then where is the question of additional step?" He also said that Pakistan wants to negotiate 'with a gun in one hand'

 Pakistan is not involved in the arms race but we cannot see the neighbors raising arms and will take all possible measures to respond to it
 '' Responding to Nawaz Sharif's statement, India's Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar said that he was "totally in denial of Pakistan's role in the Uri attack" and the glorification of terrorist Burhan Wani reflects Pakistan's involvement with terrorism
 is
 burhan vaani ko netaa bataanaa sharmnaak he or aatanki kii tarif se bharat hairaan he
 Akbar said, 'we heard the glorification of a terrorist
 vaani hijbul kaa ghoshit commander tha, jise aatanki samooh ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 It is surprising that the leader of a nation can glorify a self-propagating terrorist on such a platform

 '(input language) pakistan ke purv cricket captain shahid aafridi ne antat: apni aayu ko lekar bana rahasy khatm karte hue khulaasa kiya he ki unka janm 1975 main hua tha or aadhikarik aankadon ke anusaar 1980 main nahin
 This revelation in Afridi's autobiography meant that he was not 16 years old when he hit a record 37-ball century against Sri Lanka in Nairobi in 1996
 aafridi ne apni aatmakatha ‘game changer’ main likhaa, ‘main sirf 19 saal kaa tha, 16 saal kaa nahin jaisaa ki unhone daawa kiya
 i was born in 1975
 isliye haa, adhikariyon ne meri umr galat likhi
 Afridi's claim of being 19 years old is confusing because if he was born in 1975, he should be 21 years old during a record century

 ’ Aamir Khan's call against Kanya fetus killing in his TV show 'satyamev Jayate' has been seen throughout the country
 soochna or prasaaran mantri ambika soni ne aamir ko phone karke unhen satyamev jayate kii kamyaabi ke liye badhai di he
 Aamir Khan's call is echoing far and wide
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bhi twitor par kaha he ki aamir khan kaa sho ek behtareen pahal he or ve aamir se milane ke liye baichaiyn hai
 Finally, Aamir Khan shows what he says
 apane tivi sho ke pehle episod se samaaj main halchal machaane ke baad aamir khan jaipur pahunch gaye hai
 He is going to meet Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot at 5 pm on Wednesday to discuss the issue of female feticide
 apane tivi sho main kanya bhrun hatya kaa jwalanth mudda uthaakar aamir khan ne puure desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya
 While Aamir received accolades from the people for this show, his appeal was strongly influenced
 'mistar parfectionist' aamir khan ne jab apane sho main kanya bhrun hatya kaa mudda uthaaya, to sidhe logon ke dilon ko chhu gaya
 Aamir had said during his show that he would not only write a letter to the Chief Minister of Rajasthan on this issue, but would also demand that the cases of doctors trapped in the sting operation of journalists be heard in the fast track court
 ajtak ke kaarykram main rajasthan ke swasthya mantri raaj kumaar sharma ne bhi kah diya ki rajya sarkaar aamir ke saath he
 Significantly, during the show, Aamir Khan had asked people to express their views through SMS and Internet
 aamir kii apil kaa is kadar asar hua ki internet par aamir ke pej par 24 ghante ke bheetar 42000 logon ne apni pratikriya di
 Voices to stop female feticide in the country have also been raised earlier, but every effort went in vain
 ab aamir khan ke is sho ke baad lagata he ki badlaav aane vaala he
 
 
 After all, Aamir Khan also wants the same
 fasebuk lagaataar 9 ghante tak down rahaa he
 During this time, people could not see the photos on social media platforms
 ye pareshaani duniya bhar main thi or fasebuk sahit Instagarm, Messenger or whatsapp main bhi photose open or send karne main dikkat hui
 Due to this global outage, a big disclosure has also taken place
 fasebuk har yugers kii photo kis tarah se store karata he or kya naam die jate hai ab ye saamne aa chukaa he
 Let us tell you that such details of Facebook users have AI prepared by the company i
e
 Artificial Intelligence
 ab is samasya ko company ne thik kar liya he, lekin vajah ab company ne nahin bataai he
 Generally, the company does not give reasons for such a problem
 fasebuk kii is problem ke baad logon photo kii jagah par ye text form main dikhne laga ki us thambanel main kya he
 For example, if you have a photo in your album and you are with a pet and are on vacation, here you will find all this written in text form
 album kii har tasviir main is tarah likhaa mila - image may contain: 1 person smiling yaa image may contain: cat
 Now you can get an idea of how your data is stored with Facebook
 ye to ek udhaaharan he jo shaayad fasebuk kii ek galati se aapako dikh gaya
 But Facebook stores many such information
 aapako bataa den ki ye sirf fasebuk kii hi kahani nahin he, balki instagram par bhi aisa hi he
 That is, the pictures here are also stored with the same details
 bhale hi aapako apni fasebuk photo kii itani ditels na ho, lekin fasebuk aapaki tasveeron kii choti se choti ditels apane paas rakhata he
 Now you might have got an idea of how much data leakage affects the privacy of a common user
 ab ye saaf nahin he ki is khaas data, yani aapaki photose kii jaankariyon kaa yuj fasebuk kaise karata he
 It is possible that Facebook will be using this data for its targeted ads, because it must have been written somewhere in Facebook's long broad policy, which a normal user presses the button of YES without seeing it, and Facebook says it clearly That we do nothing without the user's content
 fasebuk kii bhi baat sahi he
 It would be better to call it the Kareena effect
