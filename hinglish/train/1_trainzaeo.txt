 puure din ke is raajnneetik jutan main wo baaki netaaon ke saath milakar apane liye nai raajnneetik jameen talashne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 However, in his press conference before the conference, he said that this conference has been called to save the soul of the Constitution and it has nothing to do with anyone's politics
 lekin is sawaal kaa unhone koi jawaab nahin diya ki bihar main mahagathbandhan ke tuutane ke baad hi unhen aise kisi sammelan kii jarurat mahasoos kyon hui
 Politicians believe that the conference convened by Sharad Yadav on August 17 will determine the condition and direction of his political life
 agar wo is sammelan main khulkar nitish ke khilaaf aate hai to 19 agast ko jadyu kii rashtriya kaaryakaarani main unhen party se baahar kaa rasta bhi dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, if they do not openly speak in this meeting and talk only in gestures, then it will affect the mood of other parties and leaders who came with them
 bihar main mahagathbandhan tuutane ke baad se lagaataar sharad ke sampark main rahane vaale kuch chaatr netaaon kaa maananaa he ki sharad yadav ab khulkar ladane or sangharsh karne ke mood main aa chuke hai

 Indian tigers are constantly stressed
 isaki vajah se unki prajnan kshamta bhi lagaataar gir rahi he
 There is also aggression in their normal life behavior
 itnaa hi nahin unke bich aapasi jhagade bhi bad rahe hai
 The reason for all this is no one else but 'humans'
 darasal, madhyapradesh ke bandhavgarh or kanha tiger rigerv ke baaghon par kiye gaye adhyayan main yah tathy saamne aae hai
 According to research 'physiological stress response of Tigers due to anthropogenic disturbance special tourism in to Central India Tiger Reserve' published in the July issue of the journal 'conservation Physiology' emanating from Oxford, the main reason for this is the disorganized tourists and their transport
 Because of this there is noise
 doctor ji umapathy ke netritv main hue is shodh main bandhavgarh tiger rigerv or kanha tiger rigerv main maujuud baaghon kii physiology kaa adhyan kiya gaya he
 Dr
 ji umapathy ke mutabik, paryatakon kii baari sankhya or unke vyavhaar kii vajah se nar or maadaa donon tarah ke chiton main tanaav kaa str bad rahaa he
 Tourist transport is also proving to be a factor responsible for stress
 isse pehle bhi vaigyanikon kii isi team ne rajasthan ke sariska tiger rigerv main adhyayan kiya tha
 The results of this research also showed almost the same results
 isamen paaya gaya tha ki paryaavarniya pradooshan kii vajah se yahaan ke baaghon main tanaav kaa str bahut zyada he
 Due to this, their fertility has seen a steady decline
 kaise kiya gaya adhyan?hyderabad kii conjarveshan of inderd spisij-centre for cellular and moulicular biology (sisiembi) ke vaigyanikon kii team ne madhya pradesh ke donon tiger rigerv se baaghon ke mel ke 341 sample (fical sample) liye
 Apart from this, the number of tourist arrivals, human activity and number of vehicles were also collected
 baaghon ke mel kaa 'fical glucocarticwide metabolite' pareekshan kiya gaya
 That is, the level of a steroid hormone present in the stool was measured according to different statistics of the presence of tourists
 paaya gaya jab paryatakon kii sankhya zyada thi hormone kaa str bhi badha tha
 The behavior of tigers was also found to be stressful
 aise samay main kuch chitah saham jate the yaa phir aakraamak ho jate the
 The level of this hormone was found to be higher during the arrival of tourists in both tigers present in the tiger reserve
 kitna ghaatak asar!baaghon main glucocorticwide ke str main badhotaree hone par vikaas, prajnan, rog pratirohak kshamta or mansapeshiyon main kuposhan (muscular etrophy) jaise hanikaarak asar dikhaai dete hai
 Scientists recommend the need to control the vehicles of tourists, strictly prohibit the honking of the horns, prohibit other human activities including making the water source for cheetah away from the tourist spot

 Despite not knowing the meaning of a word in Manipuri language, you will not be able to deny the hypnotic effect of magic by climbing on its head

 Till now we have seen only the climax and pinnacle of the amazing achievements of Ratan's Rangkarma, not the thick darkness of his foundation
 unke rachanaakaar kii talash ke dwandv, aashaa-niraashaa, safalataa-vifaltaa or bahustareey chunautiyon se jujhane ke anwarat sangharsh nahin dekhe
 But it is a pleasant information and rare opportunity for curious color workers, readers, observers and researchers to get to know the hitherto unknown or little known mysterious world of Ratan Thiam's personality and color work

 ve unki kalpanashiltaa or rachanaatmakataa ke utsa, unke avchetan kaa utkhanan or unki rang-sristi ke andhere nepathy main bhi taak-jhaank karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Some of the sutras, truths, facts that emerge as a result, are being mentioned briefly
 1
 Ratan believes that he is no intellectual, philosopher, teacher, only an artist
 isliye ve apni rachana ko darshakon se saajha karte hai
 Some also do self-sufficiency
 2
 He is only interested in plays that challenge him, prompting his thinking, understanding and creativity
 3
 They have full respect for the playwright and his word
 ve swayan ko usamen chhedchhad kaa adhikari nahin maanate
 But it is not considered necessary to repeat the play as suggested by the playwright
 4
 War is not only in Manipur, India or Asia, it is the most perplexing problem in the world and in the human future
 yuddh keval baahar hi nahin bheetar bheekrukai roopon or staron par ladaa ja rahaa he
 Plays like Andhayug, Urubhang, Uttara Priyadarshi, Chakravyuh are proof of this concern for Ratan's soul
 5
 There is an insatiable thirst to see and hear something new in them every moment
 unka rangakarm ek nirantar khoj or prayog he
 They believe that colors have their own Natyashastra
 inkaa sambandh bhi ras se he
 Sound produces color and colors also produce sound

 presidential dibet se pehle saal bhar tak republican party ke bheetar trump kaa solah ummidavaaron ke saath muqabla hua
 The final debate was with John Cassich, when Trump was elected to the presidential candidate
 usee tarah democratic party ke bheetar hillari clinton ne paanch ummidavaaron se bahes kii
 Defeating them all, she had her final match with Bernie Sanders and eventually became the candidate
 kanuunan bharat main bhi raajnneetik dalon main adhyaksh ke chunaav kii vyavastha he
 But have you heard of any party that any BJP leader from Ara has contested the election of President and has reached the national level by impressing with his talent
 usee tarah rajpipla se koi block str kaa congressi adhyaksh pad ke chunaav main utar gaya ho
 Does this happen from the common to the left parties
 nahin hota he
 Now if you want a Presidential Debate, are you ready for Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Yashwant Sinha, Vijender Gupta, Udit Raj, Satish Upadhyay, Sushil Modi, within the BJP before Prime Minister Modi's candidature is finalized? Rajnath Singh, debate with Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 antim do ummidavaaron main jo jite use bijepi kaa ummidavaar banaaya jaae
 Similarly, in Congress, Rahul should have a debate with Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasad, Milind Deora, Priya Dutt, Rita Bahuguna, Ajay Maken, Jairam Ramesh and after the final contest between the two, the Congress party will be the Prime Minister
 Candidate should be decided
 hamane amareeki chunaav vyavastha se marketing, kawarej or prabandhan kaa tarika puri tarah se aayaat kar liya he
 Like here, surveys are conducted day and night and the show runs on TV as to who will become chief minister and who will become prime minister
 pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri ke naam par baaki vidhayak yaa saansad bina apni yogyata ke pradarshan ke jeet jate hai
 In the US, no Republican candidate can win for the Senate or Congress in the name of Trump
 sabko party or kshetra main apni yogyata sabit kerani hoti he
 You must have heard about the town hall of Prime Minister Modi and Rahul Gandhi
 ye sab amareeki chunavi jansampark or corporate ke model hi to hai
 Now rallies are being held in stadiums in India too
 dibet ke baad amareeki channelon par bhi charchaa sun rahaa tha ki falaan netaa ne kya pahana, kaisaa bolaa, kitni baar pani piyaa, bahes par niyantran rakh paaya yaa nahin
 In America, candidates have to clarify the policies throughout the year
 lekin agar yah system itnaa hi saaf suthra he to isi chunaav main raashtrapati pad ke liye do or ummidavaar hai, kya unka koi kawarej hua
 We are choosing the leader, not the groom
 vahaan bhi bharat kii tarah media ke bhatakane or bikne kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 Like every election, there is talk of falling credibility in this election
 paise ke dam par vigyaapan kaa spes kharidkar virdohi ummidavaar ko charchaa se baahar karne kii tarkeeb khub chalati he
 You must have seen on TV that there is a debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
 wo bahes ho rahi he vishvavidhyalay main
 Our leaders also give interviews, but get the questions written in advance, if they go among the students, they ask for a chit of the questions first
 trump or clinton kii bahes ko jo ankar sanchalit kar rahaa tha wo pehle bataata he ki sawaal mere hai or kisi se saajha nahin kiye gaye hai
 While Hillary and Trump were arguing, the debate was being shown live in the auditorium of all universities in the United States
 dibet se pehle panel kii charchaa bhi hui or dibet ke baad bhi charchaa hui
 Such debate is organized by the student branches of both the parties there
 yaheen se bhavishya ke liye netaa bhi paidaa hote hai
 There was also debate as to how neutral the anchor that conducted Trump's and Hillary's debate was
 aapane to do mukhya ummidavaaron ke bich kii bahes ko hi bharat main dekha he lekin vahaan ke vishvavidhyalayon main bahes par bahes hoti he
 If we demand this in India, some people will start saying that they have come to study with tax money or to do politics
 america main is vakt seenet or congress kaa bhi chunaav ho rahaa he
 There is also debate between candidates at every level
 america kaa loktantr jitna bhi mahaan ho lekin uske chunaav main kisi garib kaa cheharaa nahin dikhataa he
 In India, the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister is seen from the stage, how is the financial condition of the people brought to his rally by paying two and a half to five hundred rupees
 america ke netaa kisi garib ko lekar apni smriti bataate hai ki mere dada ji dryver the
 Hearing this, people get emotional there
 family tach aa jaataa he or bhul jate hai ki jo netaa apane dada kii dryveri kaa kissa suna rahaa he uske prachaar kaa bajet ek hazaar karod se lekar teen hazaar karod tak kaa he
 You can see how much money has been spent by going to opensecret
org
 jo paisa batch jaataa he wo donor ko lautaa diya jaataa he
 This time both of them are going to spend 6000 crores
 6000 karod
 This is the first debate
 trump raashtrapati obama par aarope lagaate rahe hai ki obama ne aatanki sanghathan iesas kii sthapana kii he or hillari clinton uski kofounder hai
 If such allegations are made in India, then the unemployed lawyers associated with the party should file a defamation case
 trump ne ye maamla phir uthaa diya
 Hillary Clinton kept saying that i have plans to fight ISIS
 trump ne kaha ki aap shatru ko bataa rahi hai ki aap kya kar rahi hai
 They are denying that you supported ISIS in the name of fighting
 hillari ne bataaya ki iesas se ladane ke liye tech companiyon ke saath milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 Air strikes will also have to be carried out
 trump ne kaha ki iraq se sena hataane ke faisle ke kaaran hi iesas jaise sanghathan ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Trump said that Clinton has been claiming to deal with ISIS for many years, but she has now spread to many countries with a small organization
 tippaniyan In this way, there was a debate between the two for ninety minutes on all issues ranging from tax
 media ne donon kii baton kii fact checking kii or bataaya ki kisne jawaab dete vakt kis tarah se tathyon ko sahi bataaya yaa galat bataaya
 The debate took place in 2016, but Hillary Clinton questioned Trump about Trump's refusal to rent a house to blacks in the 1970s
 isliye wo naslbhedi hai or obama kii paidaaish ke kilaaf jhooth failaa rahe hai
 Clinton also said Trump was not saying whether he paid taxes or not
 sabhi ummidavaaron ne apana tex ritern saarvajanik kiya he
 Why not trump
 hillari kaa aarope he ki trump tex nahin dete hai
 Trump's answer was that it means they are smart
 to hillari ne kaha ki aapane sena ke liye kuch nahin diya, swasthya yaa skool ke liye kuch nahin diya
 Trump made Hillary's illness a point that she had become weak
 stemina nahin he
 You can take a sigh of relief after hearing all this that we have been falling below it
 bhaashanon main girane kii hode ke liye hamen sienen or fox news dekhne kii zarurat nahin he
 We know the fall
 trump kaa ubhaar puri duniya main bahes kaa mudda he
 It is being said that America is moving towards the right
 jahaan baahar se aae logon yaa duusare dharmon ke prati kam sahishnutaa he
 Trump's words and threads are strange
 hillari clinton is bahes ke baad aage bataai ja rahi hai lekin kya bahes se hi vahaan nattejey tay hote hai
 America is changing because of trump or is restless due to its poverty
 kanuunan bharat main bhi raajnneetik dalon main adhyaksh ke chunaav kii vyavastha he
 But have you heard of any party that any BJP leader from Ara has contested the election of President and has reached the national level by impressing with his talent

 America is changing because of trump or is restless due to its poverty
 pradhanmantri modi or rahul gandhi ke toun haul kaa aapane zikr suna hoga
 These are all models of American electoral public relations and corporate
 ab to bharat main bhi stadimon main reliyaan hone lagi hai
 After the debate, the American channels were also listening to the discussion about what the particular leader wore, how he spoke, how often he drank water, whether he could control the debate
 america main to saal bhar ummidavaaron ko nitiyon par safai deni padati he
 But if this system is so clean, then in this election there are two more candidates for the presidency, did they have any coverage
 ham netaa chun rahe hai, duulhaa nahin
 There, like India, the media is being accused of wandering and selling
 har chunaav kii tarah is chunaav main vishwasaneeyata girane kii baat ho rahi he
 With the help of money, the trick is to get the candidate out of the discussion by buying the ad space
 aapane tivi par dekha hoga ki donald trump or hillari clinton ke bich bahes ho rahi he
 That debate is happening in the university
 hamaare netaa bhi intervyuu dete hai magar pehle se sawaal likhva lete hai, chaatro ke bich jate hai to sawaalon kii chit pehle manga lete hai
 The anchor that was conducting the Trump and Clinton debates first states that the questions are mine and have not been shared with anyone
 jis vakt hillari or trump bahes kar rahe the usee vakt america ke tamaam vishvavidhyalayon ke auditorium main is dibet ko live dikhaaya ja rahaa tha
 There was also a panel discussion before the debate and there was a discussion after the debate
 is tarah kii bahes kaa aayojan vahaan donon dalon kii chaatr shakhaaen karti hai
 It is also where leaders are born for the future
 is baat par bhi bahes hui ki jis ankar ne trump or hillari kii bahes ko sanchalit kiya wo kitna tatasth tha
 You have seen the debate between the two main candidates in India, but there is a debate on the debate in the universities there
 bharat main isaki maang karenge to kuch log kehane lagenge ki tex ke paise se padhane aae hai yaa raajnneeti karne
 The Senate and Congress are also being elected in America
 vahaan bhi har str par ummidavaaron ke bich bahes hoti he
 Whatever great the democracy of America, but no poor face is seen in its election
 bharat main pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri ko manch se dikh to jaataa he ki unki raily main dhai sau se paanch sau rupee dekar laae logon kii mali haalat kisi he
 The leader of America tells his memory about a poor person that my grandfather was a driver
 ise sunakar vahaan log bhavuk ho jate hai
 The family touch comes and forgets that the budget of publicity of the leader who is narrating the story of his grandfather's transportation ranges from one thousand crores to three thousand crores
 aap opensikret dot oarji par jaakar dekh sakate hai ki kitna paisa aayaa he kitna kharch hua he
 The money left is returned to the donor
 is baar donon milakar 6000 karod kharch karne vaale hai
 6000 crores
 ye pehla dibet he
 Trump has been accusing President Obama of setting up the terrorist organization ISIS and Hillary Clinton as its cofounder
 bharat main aise aarope lag jaaen to party se jude berojgaar vakil manahani kaa cese kar den
 Trump raised this matter again
 hillari clinton bolti raheen ki mere paas iesas se ladane kii yojana he
 Trump said that you are telling the enemy what you are doing
 ve tanj kar rahe hai ki aapane iesas kaa ladane ke naam par samarthan kiya
 Hillary explained that it would have to work closely with tech companies to fight ISIS
 hawaii hamale bhi karne honge
 Trump said the decision to withdraw troops from Iraq gave an opportunity to an organization like ISIS to flourish
 trump ne kaha ki clinton to kai saal se iesas se nipatane kaa daawa kar rahi hai lekin wo chote se sanghathan se ab kai deshon main fail chukaa he
 The comments is tarah se tex se lekar tamaam muddon par nabbe minute tak donon ke bich bahes hui
 The media did a fact-checking of both of them and explained how the facts were correct or misrepresented while replying
 bahes 2016 main ho rahi he lekin hillari clinton ne trump se sawaal kar diya ki 1970 ke dashak main trump ne ashwet ko kiraaye par makaan dene se manaa kar diya tha
 That is why they are racist and spreading lies against Obama's birth
 clinton ne yah bhi kaha ki trump yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki ve tex dete the yaa nahin
 All the candidates have made their tax returns public
 trump kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Hillary alleges that Trump does not pay taxes
 trump kaa jawaab tha ki iskaa matlab he ki ve smart hai
 So Hillary said that you gave nothing for the army, nothing for health or school
 trump ne hillari kii beemaari ko mudda bana diya ki ve kamazor ho gai hai
 Stamina is not
 yah sab sunakar aap raahat kii saans le sakate hai ki ham isse bhi neeche girte rahe hai
 We don't have to watch CNN and Fox News to compete for speeches
 ham girnaa jaanate hai
 The emergence of Trump is a matter of debate all over the world
 kaha ja rahaa he ki america dakshinpanth kii taraf ja rahaa he
 Where there is less tolerance towards people from outside or other religions
 trump kii baaten or mudraayen ajeeb hai
 Hillary Clinton is being told further after this debate, but whether the debate itself determines the outcome
 america trump ke kaaran badal rahaa he yaa apni garibi ke kaaran baichaiyn he
 You must have seen on TV that there is a debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
 wo bahes ho rahi he vishvavidhyalay main
 Our leaders also give interviews, but get the questions written in advance, if they go among the students, they ask for a chit of the questions first
 trump or clinton kii bahes ko jo ankar sanchalit kar rahaa tha wo pehle bataata he ki sawaal mere hai or kisi se saajha nahin kiye gaye hai
 While Hillary and Trump were arguing, the debate was being shown live in the auditorium of all universities in the United States
 dibet se pehle panel kii charchaa bhi hui or dibet ke baad bhi charchaa hui
 Such debate is organized by the student branches of both the parties there
 yaheen se bhavishya ke liye netaa bhi paidaa hote hai
 There was also debate as to how neutral the anchor that conducted Trump's and Hillary's debate was
 aapane to do mukhya ummidavaaron ke bich kii bahes ko hi bharat main dekha he lekin vahaan ke vishvavidhyalayon main bahes par bahes hoti he
 If we demand this in India, some people will start saying that they have come to study with tax money or to do politics
 america main is vakt seenet or congress kaa bhi chunaav ho rahaa he
 There is also debate between candidates at every level
 america kaa loktantr jitna bhi mahaan ho lekin uske chunaav main kisi garib kaa cheharaa nahin dikhataa he
 In India, the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister is seen from the stage, how is the financial condition of the people brought to his rally by paying two and a half to five hundred rupees
 america ke netaa kisi garib ko lekar apni smriti bataate hai ki mere dada ji dryver the
 Hearing this, people get emotional there
 family tach aa jaataa he or bhul jate hai ki jo netaa apane dada kii dryveri kaa kissa suna rahaa he uske prachaar kaa bajet ek hazaar karod se lekar teen hazaar karod tak kaa he
 You can see how much money has been spent by going to opensecret
org
 jo paisa batch jaataa he wo donor ko lautaa diya jaataa he
 This time both of them are going to spend 6000 crores
 6000 karod
 This is the first debate

 This is the first debate

 Hillary Clinton kept saying that i have plans to fight ISIS
 trump ne kaha ki aap shatru ko bataa rahi hai ki aap kya kar rahi hai
 They are denying that you supported ISIS in the name of fighting
 hillari ne bataaya ki iesas se ladane ke liye tech companiyon ke saath milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 Air strikes will also have to be carried out
 trump ne kaha ki iraq se sena hataane ke faisle ke kaaran hi iesas jaise sanghathan ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Trump said that Clinton has been claiming to deal with ISIS for many years, but she has now spread to many countries with a small organization

 wo achche ghar main paidaa hui, convent skool se apni padhai puri kii
 Englishman spoke English
 paas main karodon kii dautal thi, hamaare samaaj kii ek birdari use apana bhagwaan maanati thi lekin ek din isi bhagwaan kaa qatl ho gaya
 2009, place Gandhinagar
 gandhinagar loksabhaa chanaav main khud ke liye vot maang rahi ye sonia de
 In front of Sonia, no one else was contesting bjp's strong leader LK Advani
 saal 2010, jagah ahmedabad
 Sonia draped in a bridal dress
 ye apane saajan kaa intazaar kar rahi he
 There is also the desire to spend life with his brother-in-law
 saal 2011, jagah ahmedabad, ramp par chalati ladki ye bhi sonia
 2011, place Ahmedabad
 anna hazaare ke samarthan main raily nikaalte hue bhi ye vahi sonia he
 Sonia landed for Anna on the streets of Ahmedabad when Anna was sitting on a hunger strike at Ramaleela Maidan in Delhi
 saal 2011, jagah ahmedabad
 And now Sonia is not alive
 sonia kanvent skool main padhi-likhi, khubasurat achche ghar se ai, farrotedaar angeji bolne vaali koi or nahin balki ek kinnar thi
 a Kinnar whom some Kinnar Kinnar fraternity believed to be God
 ek aisi kinnar jiske paas karodon kii daulat thi
 a eunuch with whom people loved, had reverence, but was equally afraid
 usee sonia kii goli maar kar saream hatya kar di gai?ol india kinnar association kii adhyaksh sonia kaa murder apane peeche kai raaj samete he
 After all, was the whole truth behind this sensational murder? The assassination was actually done by Sonia, the national president of the eunuchs, and the police also came to know about Sonia's status
 darasal sonia koi maamuli kinnar nahin thi
 Rather, she has left the property of crores behind her
 to kya sonia kaa katl isi daulat ke liye kiya gaya? yaa phir sajeesh kuch or he?taarikh, 24 nanvabar 2011
 It was 8:15 PM
 jagah vahi purana ahmedabad
 a carriage stops outside the Rupali cinema theater in the city
 gaadi se kinnaron kii adhyaksh sonia de utarati he
 She has come here to eat panipuri
 abhi sonia gaadi se utari hi thi ki tabhi ek auto rickshaw uske paas aa kar rukta he
 Two men descend from it and they start firing bullets at Sonia
 ek goli sonia ke sir main lagati he or teen chaati main
 Sonia dies on the spot
 ahmedabad ke disipi harekrishn patel ke anusaar raat 8
 At 15 pm, Imran alias Sonia came here to eat Panipuri, only then some unknown people came and fired on him and he died there
 haalanki abhi tak hatyaron ke bare main kuch patta nahi chal paaya he
 As soon as the news of this massacre took place in the city, the entire Kannar fraternity was stirred up
 katl unki sabase taqatvar netaa or rashtriya adhyaksh kaa hua tha
 In view of the history of mutual enmity between the eunuchs, the first suspicion of the police was on the enmity of the fraternity
 lihaaja police ne sonia ke ghar or rishtedaaron se hi poochtacha kar tafteesh ko aage badhaane kaa faisla kiya
 But when the police reached Sonia's house, her eyes were torn
 15 karod se zyada kii sampatti, lakhon ke zevaraat, ahmedabad or mount abu main bangala, mahangi gaadiyaan, ahmedabad main ek restaraan or karodon kaa bank-balance
 For the first time after Sonia's house, the police came to know about Sonia's status
 to kya sonia kaa katl isi daulat kii khatir hua? police kii tafteesh yaheen se shuru hui? bakaul police shuruuaati tafteesh main sonia kii hatya kinnaron kii aapasi ranjish kaa hi nateeja lagati he
 Sonia Dey had a long-standing rivalry with another group of eunuchs, Sanju Dey, and the two often feuded over the supremacy over the city
 duusare group kii nigahen sonia kii athaah daulat par bhi thi
 During the investigation, the police also came to know that Sonia's relationship with her husband Yusuf was not that good
 par iske baavjood sonia ne bahut si sampatti yusuf ke hi naam kar rakhi thi
 Then why would Joseph kill Sonia? But Sonia's family says that Yousuf can do this
 sonia ki maan nasir ajmeri bataati hai ki usuf or uske bich main paise ke liye ladaai hoti rahati thi
 Sonia named the property of Mount Abu to him
 baganla bhi liya tha phir bhi wo har maheene or pese maangata tha
 At present, the police is trying to find out who can benefit the most from Sonia's murder
 Because it is certain that the purpose of shooting at Sonia was to kill her because when she was killed she had one and a half lakh rupees in her purse
 lekin qaatilon ne uske purse ko haath tak nahin lagaaya
 Sonia de Yeh is the name whom the eunuchs living with her believed to be their god
 sonia agar dosti karti thi to use bhi apane dil se nibhaati bhi thi ore dushmani karti thi to use bhi nibhaati thi
 Spend the night singing
 
 Lose your day Sit like a three-cornered, tit for fruit is not a mere joy, not Nayanan, not Snehatulasi, do not go there; The Punsonia was very great masters of eunuchs and his status can be guessed from the fact that his disciples were in the country, and his disciples were also believed that as a friend of Sonia her enemies were equally
 sonia kii ek cheli kangana bataati he ki sonia ke jitne chaahane vaale the, utane hi dushman the
 Sonia's father had his own cable business in Ahmedabad
 sonia kaa bachapan apni nani ke saath mubai main beetaa
 He completed his studies from a convent school in Mumbai itself
 isiilie wo farrotedaar angrezi bolti thi
 Sonia's childhood name was Imran Ajmeri, but after coming to Kinnar society, she changed her name to Sonia
 parivaar se naata todane ke baad sonia ne apni ek alag duniya basaai
 Within a short span of time, he dominated the Kinnar society of Ahmedabad
 iske baad phir sonia ne kabhi peeche mud kar nahin dekha
 Sonia used to roam with her disciples in posh areas of Ahmedabad for omen
 uski kamai kaa sabase bada jariya yahi tha
 But the police also used to collect donations from the Sonia Kinnar community
 iske alaava uske kai duusare dhandhe bhi the jiske bare main police jaanch kar rahi he
 Maya, another disciple of Sonia, tells that Sonia's murder has been done for money only
 sonia ne 2002 main ahmedabad main vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha or saal 2004 or 2009 main usne laalkrishna adwani ke khilaaf bataur nirdaleey ummidavaar chunaav ladaa tha lekin donon baar uski jamaanat zabt ho gayi thi
 In the meantime, Sonia also married a man named Yusuf and bought several bungalows and many other things in the name of Yusuf in his property worth crores
 sonia ke jitne chaahane vaale the utane hi dushman the, lekin itnaa to saaf he ki sonia kii hatya ho chuki he
 At present, the police is investigating who was going to benefit the most from Sonia's death
 kyonki police kaa maananaa he ki kaatil kii najar kahin naa kahin sonia kii daulat par hi gadi thi
 After repeated complaints from the people for not registering cases by the police, the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to issue a circular to all the states asking them to ensure that all the complaints received by the police stations Be understood as FIR

 In the circular, the State Governments and Union Territories will be directed to ensure registration of all complaints as firs
 yah kadam logon kii ore se baar-baar shikaayat milane ke baad uthaaya gaya he
 People often complain that the police often adopt tactical tactics in the matter of filing a complaint and are reluctant to immediately file an FIR on a complaint
 is paripatr kaa uddeshy he ki agar koi shikaayat juthi bhi ho to bhi police ko praathmiki darj kar uski jaanch kerani he
 "if the complaint is found to be false, the police can remove the FIR," said an official
 lekin ise sahi shikayaton ko praathmiki ke taur par darj karne main baadhak nahin hona chahie
 This step has been taken after the allegation by Ruchika Girhotra's family in which she alleged that police initially filed an FIR when she filed a complaint against former Haryana DGP SPS Rathore
 Was refused
 police ne tab bhi praathmiki darj karne se inkaar kar diya tha jab ruchika ke bhai ko galat aaropon ko lekar police ne pratadit kiya tha
 Through the proposed amendment in CRPC, the government wants to make it mandatory for the station in-charge to state the reason for filing a case and not registering the case after receiving any complaint

 The court will decide whether the encounter was fake or not
 Pillai said Headley's statements cannot be considered as the last truth
 unhone iske bal par koi nishkarsh nikaalane ko jaldbaaji qaraar diya
 Pillai said that there is scope for investigation in the Ishrat case and a charge sheet has been filed
 ishrat jahanus group kii sadsy thi jisane gujarat ke netaaon ke khilaaf hinsak karrwai kii thi
 He said that the court would decide on the basis of the evidence whether the encounter was fake or not

 She was definitely part of the group which went round India & finally ended up in Guj with plot to take violent action against leaders: GK Pillai - ANI (@ani_news) February 25, 2016 lashkar-e-taiba was on site Came and died in the encounter

 The real thing is that the encounter was fake or correct
 sibiai ke baad yah maamla court main he
 During that time Ishrat got the benefit of doubt
 us vakt ishrat ke khilaaf koi sidhaa saboot saamne nahin aayaa tha
 He was later named on the lashkar-e-taibaki site

 There was no direct evidence, except that let put her name on the website, so i said maybe she was unwitting player-gk Pillai on Ishrat jehan-ani (@ani_news) February 25, 2016 Headley told- On the plot of 11 Mumbai terror attacks, terrorist David Headley made a big disclosure in the court, saying that Ishrat Jahan was the suicide bomber of lashkar-e-taiba

 This threat is not from anyone else but from the CIA, one of the world's most dangerous secret services
 darasal, america khufia agency siie ne apana aglaa torget kim jong un ko hi banaaya he
 Despite all the threats from America, Kim Jong is not only flagging off the nuclear test but is also threatening to bomb America

 For the past several decades, America has not faced any enemy who is not afraid of it or who has scared it
 magar korian penisula ke is chote se desh or us chote se desh ke is chote kad vaala shaasha naa to america se darataa he balki use daraata bhi he
 Even after a million attempts, America is unable to understand what is it that Jong did for them? Because he is not afraid of threats and he has opened arms himself
 lihaaza america ko ab samaj main aane laga he ki ise na to dhamka kar or na hi hathiyaaron kaa rob dikhaakar dabaaya ja saktaa he isliye kim ko maarane ke liye usne apane khufia killer chhod die hai
 Which have been many failed attempts so far

 According to this Korean agency, in May this year, on the orders of the CIA and South Korea's intelligence agency, some terrorists infiltrated Kim Jong Un's headquarters in North Korea for the purpose of carrying out a chemical attack
 jinhen hamale se pehle hi pakad kar is sajeesh kaa pardaafash kar diya gaya
 After this revelation, North Korea started using the same weapon to discredit the US
 jiskaa istemaal khud america duusare deshon ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya karata tha
 North Korea has called the cia's move a terrorist step and the CIA a terrorist organization for plotting to assassinate its ruler
 duusare deshon main sarkaar ukhaad phenkane ko sahi tehraane ke liye america girggit kii tarah rang badalata he
 The US has also been accused of using the fight against terrorism to justify its intervention in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya
 ab america kii central intelligence agency (CIA) ne rasinic hathiyaar ke jariye marshall kim jong un ko maarane kii koshish kii
 This disgusting act of America shows that it is itself at the root of terrorism spreading in the world
 khufia sutron ke mutabik america or dakshin korea ne milakarnarth koriake shaasha kim jong un ko usee ke desh main, usee ke logon ke saamne maarane kaa plan banaaya tha
 The killer who has been hired to kill him is also named Kim
 jaankaree ke mutabik wo uttar korea main daakhil bhi ho chukaa he
 But this is not the only plan America has made to kill the President of North Korea

 Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) seems to be in a difficult position in the Delhi Legislative Assembly after the withdrawal of support from Independent MLA Rambir Shaukeen, where the number of its mlas has now reduced to half the total
 kejariwal kii do maheene puraani sarkaar ke paas 70 sadasyeey vidhansabha main congress ke samarthan ke saath ab 35 vidhayak bache hai
 In the Assembly elections held in December last year, AAP won 28 seats, making a spectacular start, but it was eight seats short of a direct majority
 antat: isane congress ke aath sadasyon ke bahari samarthan se sarkaar banaai thi
 Last week, the party expelled rebel MLA Vinod Kumar for anti-party activities, bringing the House down to 26
 kejariwal sarkaar ko janata dal united ke vidhayak shoeb ikbaal kaa samarthan hasil he
 The Kejaravila government is preparing to introduce its two important bills Janlokpal Bill and Swaraj Bill in the Delhi Legislative Assembly this week and in such a situation, it may be difficult for him to remove Rambir Shaukeen from his court
 vahiin shaukeen kaa kahana he ki kejariwal sarkaar ne bijli or pani ke muddon kaa samaadhaan nahin kiya he or isi liye vah usase samarthan waapas le rahe hai

 Usually you have seen the youth in Jammu and Kashmir either stoning or the separatists smoldering Kashmir or sitting in the shadow of a gun
 lekin jammu or kashmir rajya kii ek or tasviir he jahaan chaatr apane sapanom kii udaan se duniya jeetne kii chaah bhi rakhte hai
 These students of Kashmir intend to win the world with their enthusiasm
 kashmir main army bhartee ke dauraan ghati ke yuvako kii jabardast bheed dekhi hogi, lekin ab ye iees or ipies banane ke apane sunahare sapane ke saath kashmiri chaatr dilli pahunch rahe hai

 Out of which 150 students are selected on the basis of written examination and interview every year
 iske alaava 50 puraane chaatr hote hai
 But out of the 13000 applications received, Delhi is at number one, while Jammu and Kashmir is at number two
 vahiin uttar pradesh or bihar kaa number he jahaan se sabase zyada chaatro ne admician ke liye aavedan kiya he
 The most shocking in this is that of Jammu and Kashmir, where students pass UPSC and want to become IAS and IPS
 jammu kashmir se aavedan dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya lagaataar bad rahi he
 This time, where more than 7000 applications have come from Delhi, 1150 students have applied from Jammu and Kashmir

 acharya abhiraj rajendra mishra ne apane adhyakshiya bhaashan main kaha ki sahitya academy ne sanskrit bhashaa ke liye avismaraneey sevaayen di hai
 He further said that the obliteration of Sanskrit language would be the obliteration of culture
 isliye sanskrit bhashaa ko desh main sabhi logon ko padhanaa chahie
 In his poetry recitation Parmanand Jha recited some poems over God, above mother-fathers, over gurus, over affection
 iske baad acharya ramakant shukla ne sristi ke upar kavita paath kiya
 Apart from this, he read a few patriotic poems in recitation, which enthralled all the listeners
 unke baad sahitya academy ke salaahkaar mandal ke sanyojak acharya abhiraj rajendra mishra ne apane madhur swar main himachali pahari geeton kii madhur dhun main sanskrit geeton ko prastut kiya

 rio olipink ke liye qualifi kar chuke shooter jitu raay ne enditivi india se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki olipink main unka nishaanaa gold par hoga
 The reason for India's hopes on Jitu is also that he has recently won the World Cup bronze medal in South Korea
 jabaki kai bade diggaj shooter is championsheep main kuch khaas nahin kar sake
 The comments 10 meter air pistal main number paanch or 50 meter pistal main number do ranking rakhane vaale jitu kehete hai ki khel main utaar chadhaav aate rahete hai, upar pahunchakar usapar bane rahanaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 Jeetu said that his preparations for Rio have started and that is the reason he is participating in many championships these days
 antarrashtriya str par 11 or rashtriya str par 35 padak jeet chuke jitu kii sabase khaas baat ye he aisa kam hi jagah hua he ki uskaa nishaanaa chukaa he
 28-year-old Jeetu is in the army and gives credit to the army for whatever he is today
 isse pehle sena ke hi karnal rajyavardhan singh rathore or vijay kumaar ne olpink shooting main rajat padak jeet chuke hai

 Jeetu, who is ranked number five in the 10 meter air pistol and number two in the 50 meter pistol, says that as the game fluctuates, it is very difficult to keep up
 jitu ne kaha ki rio ke liye uski taiyaari shuru ho chuki he or yahi vajah he wo aajkal kai championsheep main hissaa le rahaa he
 The most important thing about Jitu, who has won 11 medals at the international level and 35 at the national level, is that such a small place has happened that he has been targeted
 28 saal ke jitu sena main he or aaj jo kuch bhi hai uskaa credit sena ko dete hai

 Singh called the leaders of the Hurriyat Conference like Naeem Khan to be stern of the ISI and demanded strict action against the separatist organization
 india today / aaj tak par 'oparation hurriyat' ke jariye hurriyat conference kaa asli cheharaa duniya ke saamne laane kii general singh ne saraahna kii
 General Singh said that what Naeem Khan was heard saying on camera, what else is terrorism not
 videsh rajya mantri ke mutabik hurriyat ke netaa sirf apane pariwaron kaa or apni jebon kaa bhala chaahate hai
 In an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, General Singh said that there should be no dialogue with Hurriyat leaders, while he also agreed that the time to ban Hurriyat was declared a terrorist organization
 has gone
 general ve
 K
 singh ke saath baatcheet
 
 
 
 sawaal-'aaj tak' par khaas mehmaan purv senadhyaksh or modi sarkaar ke varisht mantrigeneral wike singh, aapkaa swaagat he
 We showed 'operation Hurriyat'
 'oparation hurriyat' main hamane hurriyat conference kaa asli cheharaa jo he wo janata ke saamne rakhaa
 The top Hurriyat leaders believe that money comes from Pakistan to burn Kashmir
 or kashmir main jo bhi aag lagati he wo hurriyat ke log hi lagaate hai
 Do not fire without their saying? Answer - Congratulations to you and your channel, i appreciate it
 aapane us asli chehre ko dikhaa diya jiske bare main log jaanate the lekin bolne se kataraate the
 You did very well
 or meraa suzav he ki in chizon ko lekar pradesh kii sarkaar un logon par sakht karrwai kare jo kashmir ke bacchon ko padhane nahin dena chaahate hai
 Do not want the interest of ordinary citizens of Kashmir
 jo aise log hai jo sirf apana ghar bharna chaahate hai
 He wants the good of his relatives but wants to push the ordinary citizen inside a hell
 sawaal-naeem khan, hurriyat conferenceke provishinyal president camere par kaid hai ye kehete hue ki hamane skool jalaae
 Now tell me that they call themselves the advocates of Kashmir, but where the children go and study, the Hurriyat's president is saying that we burned these schools, these schools would not burn without us
 jawaab-ye iesai ke pitthu hai
 Follow the instructions of the ISI
 jo unako bolaa jaataa he wo bolte hai, jo kaha jaataa he wo karte hai
 They take money from them
 aise logon ko kya kahenge aap?sawaal-to ye log khule kyon gum rahe hai
 No special action has been taken against them so far
 kal hamane stats chack kiya
 Masarat Alam is in Preventive Detention
 iske alaava jitne baaki log hai, bilal lone to baahar hai, un par koi karrwai nahin hui he
 People like Syed Ali Shah Geelani are in the house arrest
 matlab unhen doodh baadaam bhi miltaa he
 The servants also live here, in AC they are meant to be resting
 kya inaki jagah tihaad jail nahin he?jawaab-itane saal se aaraam farma rahe hai, inhen bahut pehle jail chale janaa chahie tha
 But somewhere every government has been trying that maybe these people who are instigating people, they might calm down
 shaayad ye logon ko sahi baaten bataaen
 But as your channel has shown it is very clear, action is taken on them
 sawaal-par kya karrwai banati he? aatankwaad kya he? ye hi nahin ki aapane bandook uthaai he, kasaab kii tarah goli chalaai
 If you collected money, if you idiotically mobilized people, if you burned schools, is it not terrorism? kya aapke hisaab se hurriyat ko aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit karnaa chahie?jawaab-dekhie jis tarah naeem ne kaha he ki paise lekar unhone skool jalaae hai
 What is the difference between terrorism and it? un par pradesh sarkaar ko karrwai kerani chahie
 And until we take action, these people will not come on the straight line
 sawaal-kisi karrwai, kya karrwai karenge?jawaab-desh ke andar kanoon he, kashmir main bhi kanoon he
 How will they not be acted upon? or jo inke himachati banate hai
 There is a lot of support especially in Kashmir
 apana apana usamen phayda uthaa rahe hai
 As if they become advocates, i will come to a very high position in the Bar Council
 yaa falaan jagah par oonche pad par aa jaaoongaa
 People will listen
 inkaa sahaara lekar logon ko daraaya ja saktaa he, paisa banaaya ja saktaa he aadi aadi
 Question- They also cheat in dishonesty
 iesaise jo puraa paisa aata he wo khud maan rahe hai camere par ki usamen se bhi puraa paisa updrav par nahin lagaate usamen se bhi apana cat apane paas rakh lete hai
 That is, dishonesty in dishonesty? Answer - His character has become like this, no one knows what he will do
 pehle bacchon se grenade phinkavate the
 They used to give 500-500 rupees
 log the jab hamane unase kaha ki ye grenade hamako de dijie, 1000 rupaya ham se le lijie
 So it was closed
 yahi inkaa haal he
 Their mouths are so open that as much as they are poured, one does not know where they went
 or iesai iskaa phayda uthaa rahi he
 Question- i want to ask you the direct question whether the time has come to ban the Hurriyat Conference? Answer - What should be shown about them, they should be brought to legal action
 aise log jo kashmir main aatankwaad ko badhaava de rahe hai, usamen shariq ho rahe hai, usamen paisa laga rahe hai
 And the schools that are burning up to increase it are terrorists
 sawaal-aatankwaadi he, aap badi baat kah rahe hai
 Because till now he has been seen as a stake holder in dialogue in Kashmir
 baar baar modi sarkaar se poocha jaataa he ki aap inase baat kyon nahin kar rahe hai?jawaab-inaki asaliyat kashmir main jo log rah chuke hai wo sab jaan chuke hai
 The common man who is an ordinary citizen of Kashmir also knows, but he is a poor suppressed
 usko daraaya jaataa he bandookdhaari se, kya karegaa bechaara
 Yes, okay i go too
 mujhako paise mil rahe hai main bhi jaakar pathar phenkata hum
 So all this is happening without any reason
 ek baar maine pehle bhi aapke saath shaayad intervyuu main kaha tha ki gilaani jab chalate hai to unke saamne 20-25 gunde chalate hai, dukaanon ko band kara diya jaataa he
 Then it is shown on camera that Gilani is leaving, everything is closed in Srinagar
 
 
 ye gundgardee he
 The question is hooliganism, terrorism? The answer is everything
 sawaal-hamane dikhaaya ki kis tarah se skool jalaae ja rahe hai
 It is happening directly at the instigation of Pakistan
 aap kah rahe hai ki bain kar dijie hurriyat conference ko
 But only your government has to do this
 aapane kaha ki pehle kii sarkarein aise karti thim
 Now the situation is that PDP has a government but you too are partners in it
 jawaab-isiilie main kahata hum
 Is the law of the country
 pradesh kii sarkaar ko desh ke kanoon main saath dena chahie
 If there is any obstruction in the law of the country, then there are 100 ways to fix it
 kanoonee tareeke se usko sort out kiya janaa chahie
 Let me tell you one more thing
 ye kitaab he bangladesh banane ke bare main jise iesai ne likhaa tha
 And the ISI DG wrote to the people of Bangladesh under his signature that the Pakistan Army did nothing
 aapke yahaan jo bhi kukrity hue, jo bhi log maare gaye wo yaa to khud mar gaye, yaa bharatiyon ne unhen maar diya yaa apane hi logon ne maar diya
 The Pakistani Army was applying ointment there
 jo log itnaa bada jhooth bol sakate hai wo kya kuch nahin kar sakate or unki raah par chalane vaale, unase paisa lene vaale unase bade deshadrohi is desh main or koi nahin ho sakate
 Question- How should India deal with the Pakistani Army and ISI, because if the Hurriyat is getting the money then it is coming from Pakistan and ISI, via Dubai, UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
 puraa usne fund explene kiya ki kaise paisa aa rahaa he
 Answer - You have to increase your alertness
 agar unke paas dimag he to aapke paas bhi dimag he
 If your people leave NASA tomorrow, then NASA will stop, we have so much brain
 apana ek tantra banaaie, in chizon ko rokna hoga
 Questions - How to stop? Answer - There are many things
 sab chijen main aapke saamne nahin bataa saktaa
 Whether it is an economic agency, whether it is an intelligence agency or a government agency, they have to believe that such a thing does not happen
 kaise roka ja saktaa he
 How can it not be stopped? aap ye nahin pataa laga sakate ki baahar se paisa aa rahaa he
 Many people fall under his purview
 sawaal-aap ye bataaie ki jab aap army chif bhi the tab bhi hamane aap se hamane intervyuu kiya
 More or less, you have seen the same thing which has been shown till now on your camera in Operation Hurriyat
 itane saalon main duusari sarkaron ne kiya kyon nahin kuch
 We knew this, the Intelligence Agency knew it
 jawaab-dikkat ye hoti he ki sarkaron main bahut se adwisers hote hai
 Everyone has a different opinion
 har ek alag agency se aata he
 The feeling is that everyone should be okay
 lekin wo apni apni baton ke anuroop suzav dete hai
 Some would say that they should also talk with them
 lekin baat karte karte aapako pataa chale ki ye to kisi or ke pitthu hai to baat karne kaa phayda kya he
 Question - But in such a situation, there are still people like Sharad Yadav, we showed him an interview yesterday, who are saying that the operation of 'aaj Tak' is airborne, there is no point in it, they still intend to talk to Hurriyat
 Huh
 jawaab-ye to gilaani bhi kehete hai ki baraamula main kuch nahin hua
 The robbery and rape took place there for eight days, but they say nothing has happened, the Government of India is talking about it
 to politics main mat jaaie
 i do not want to go on what Sharad Yadav is saying
 varisht netaa hai, kya unka compalshan he mujhe nahin pataa
 Question- Do you think that compulsion is? Answer - Compulsion means political compaction
 sawaal-vaaki deshadrohiyon kaa, aatankwaadiyon kaa saath dena kuch to compalshan hi hoga
 Answer - We do not know why he said such a thing
 camere par cheez he
 Naeem himself is saying that he took money to burn the school
 usamen shaq kii kya baat he
 Did you not put an effigy of Naeem there or did not make any sound there
 wo khud maan rahaa he
 If there is such a thing, one should believe in it and act on such people
 sawaal-aapane bahut badi hadeline di he
 You have said very clearly that as of now you have not heard anyone say that the time has come to take immediate action on the Hurriyat Conference, the time has come to declare the leaders of the Hurriyat Conference as terrorists, ban the Hurriyat Conference
 The time has come to talk, there is no point in talking to them
 badi baat hai
 Answer - They are not doing anything for you, all for their children, for their families, all for their own pockets, what will you talk to them? Question- Do you believe that the government will do it, you are the only government 
 jawaab-sarkaar har tareeke se koshish karti he ki samasyaon kaa hal nikle, uske andar kis str par kya karegi kahana mushkil he
 But my personal opinion is that the Hurriyat has not supported any government till date
 naa hi kashmiri awam kaa saath diya he
 They have only supported themselves and their relatives
 is par soch-vichaar kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Question- And now the time to put the isi's puppets on their shoulders is over
 general wike singh aapane bebaaki se apni baat rakhi iske liye aapkaa bahut-bahut dhanyavad! 'jai Ho

 On the other hand, the Congress and NCP alliance, claiming anti-incumbency, could not do any good

 Confusing all speculation, the Shiv Sena is going to hold the bmc's power once again
 227 siton vaali biemasi main shivasena or bijepi gathbandhan ko 107 siten mili hai
 Shiv Sena has 77 seats, while BJP has won 30 seats
 pehali baar biemasi main saath chunaav ladakar bhi congress-ensipi gathbandhan 65 siton se aage nahin bad paaya
 Congress won 51 seats and NCP 14 seats

 It has directly named the Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) for plotting these attacks
 ansaari ko 25 june ko saudi arab se nirvasit kiya gaya or dilli police kii vishesh cell ne use giraftaar kiya
 He revealed that two Pakistani ISI officers named Major Iqbal and Major Sameer Ali regularly attended Lashkar meetings in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir between 2007 and 2008 (when the attacks were planned)
 uske sansanikhej khulaason ne pakistan ke is daawey ko taar-taar kar diya he ki 26 / 11 kaa hamalaa lashkar jaise un sanghathanon kaa kaam tha, jinka sarkaar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or uske liye pakistani sena jimmedaar nahin thi
 After Ansari's revelations, a new war of words has started between India and Pakistan

 Chidambaram said, "when i talk about a government sponsored organization, i do not raise my finger on any particular agency
 lekin yah to saaf he ki 26 / 11 ke hamalon main 'sarkaar' kaa samarthan yaa sarkari tantra kaa haath tha
 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik continued to follow his country's policy of denials
 unhone sajeesh kaa yah siddhant pesh kiya ki hamalon ke peeche bhartiya hi the
 Ansari said that the let chief Hafiz Saeed and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi had plotted the attack
 isse unhen bharat ko saunpe jane kii maang ko bal mila he

 usne unhen hindi main baatcheet karnaa sikhaaya, unhen media houseon ke phone number uplabdh karaae or yah bhi tips die ki kis prakaar media se baat kii jaae or kis tarah unhen gumraah kiya jaae
 Ansari, a trained electrician, was soft-spoken and rarely spoke aloud until he came in contact with activists of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in Aurangabad in 2005
 simi kaaryakartaaon ne use 2002 ke gujarat sampradayik dangon kii sidi dikhaakar apane aakaaon ke saath sampark karne ke liye uksaaya
 Officials of Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) are not surprised by Ansari's revelations
 aties ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he, ''hamen shuru se andeh tha ki ansaari hi in hamalon kii iklauti bhartiya kadi he
 After analyzing the phone conversations heard between him and other terrorists during the attack, we started paying attention to him

 Apart from this, his accent was also Indian

 Today, another young face has become an official entry in the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 bahujan samaaj party kii pramukh mayawati kii gairmaujuudagi main unke bhattije akaash anand ne agra main jansabha kii sambodhit kiya
 Mayawati has been banned from campaigning for 48 hours by the Election Commission, due to which she could not address the rally
 isi ko bahujan samaaj party ne bhunaane kii koshish kii or mayawati ke uttaradhikari kahe jane vaale unke bhattije akaash ko launch kiya
 Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also attended this public meeting of the grand alliance in Agra in western Uttar Pradesh, but everyone's eyes were on Akash Anand
 akaash ne sabase pehle jansabha ko sambodhit kiya or logon ke saamne apni buaa mayawati ke sandesh ko padhaa
 Akash told people that his aunt could not come today, so he has come out with his message
 buaa kaa sandesh he ki aap unke ummidavaaron ko bade antar se jitaayen or virodhiyon kii jamaanat jabt karavaaen
 Akash said that this would be the right answer to our Chief Election Commission
 bataa den ki isse pehle devband main hui mahagathbandhan kii pehali saajha raily main akaash anand shaamil hue the, haalanki tab unhone koi sambodhan nahin kiya tha
 Akash Anand is the son of BSP chief Mayawati's younger brother Anand and returned from abroad
 mayawati ne isse pehle apane bhai anand ko party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh banaaya tha, haalanki unhone tab ye bhi kaha tha ki vah vidhayak, saansad, mantri yaa mukhyamantri pad nahin lenge
 But he was removed from the post due to a later controversy
 pichley kaaphi samay main aise kai maukey aae hai, jab akaash media ke saamne aae hai
 Recently, when the birthday program of Mayawati took place, Akash was still in the shadows, which is why Akash came to be seen as Mayawati's successor
 beete dinon jab mayawati ne soshal media site twitor par entry kii, tab bhi yahi baat saamne ai thi ki ye akaash ke kehane par hi hua he
 Earlier, Mayawati was always away from the media, but now she constantly tweets on every issue and issues a statement

 The Congress has received a major setback for the National Herald House
 dillihoicourt(delhi High court) ne apneadesh main congress ko2 saptaah main neshnal herald house (delhi High court) khaali karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 a major decision of the Delhi High Court has come on the Herald House located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg of the National Herald
 aadesh ke anusaar AJL ko herald house khaali karnaa hoga
 The High Court has given its verdict on the central government's 30 October notice
 is tarah se court ne AJL kii yachika khaarij kar di
 However, the court has given two weeks to vacate the building
 hoicourt ne kaha ki do hafte se zyada vakt laga to kanoon ke mutabik karrwai kii jaaegi
 In fact, on November 22, the Delhi High Court reserved the judgment on the plea of AJL regarding the Central Government's decision to end the lease of the National Herald Building
 dilli hoicourt associated jarnals limited, yani AJL (neshnal herald samachaarpatr kii maalik) kii us arzi par faisla surakshit rakh liya tha jisamen leez ke praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan karne ke aaropon ke aadhaar par unki leez radd karne tathaa herald house khaali karne kaa aadesh dene ke centre sarkaar ke faisle ko chunauti di gai thi
 The Delhi High Court reserved its decision after hearing arguments from both sides
 isse pehle 13 november ko hoicourt ne sunwaayee 22 november tak ke liye sthagit kar di thi
 The High Court had said that the status quo should be maintained till the next date
 is dauraan centre kii ore se pesh SG tushaar mehta ne bharosa dilaayaa tha ki is dauraan building sil karne yaa khaali karne kii karrwai nahin hogi
 AJL said that the order is politically motivated and its purpose is to suppress and ruin the voice of dissent of the opposition parties
 darasal, centre sarkaar ke taraf se neshnal herald house ko notice diya gaya tha ki wo building khaali kar de kyoki jis makasad se sarkaar ne unhen building di thi wo kaam vahaan nahi ho rahaa he
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the High Court that according to the rule, there should be printing work in the National Herald House, while it has not been there for a long time
 iske alaava jab unhen LNDO ke taraf se pehali baar notice diya gaya tab vahandobaraa news paper kaa kaam shuru hua
 Earlier in 2008, the news paper was closed by giving VRS to all the employees of the news paper
 yani 2008 se 2016 tak publication kaa koi kaam nahi hua
 Whereas when the first notice was issued in 2016, the National Herald responded that the publication work would be resumed soon
 is par neshnal herald ke taraf se pesh vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne court se kaha ki 2008 se 2016 ke bich company kii vittiya haalat thik nahi thi isliye publication band karnaa padaa tha
 After that, once again the financial situation started recovering, and the work of the news paper started again
 philhal, hindi, urdu or english main news paper he
 Apart from this, it is also published on the Internet
 news paper printing kaa kaam kahi or hota he
 Over time the thinking of people reading the news paper has also changed
 is lihaaj se company ne internet par bhi prakashit kiya he
 Significantly, in the notice issued by the Urban Development Ministry on 30 October, AJL had asked to vacate the premises by 15 November
 is yachika par sunwaayee honi he
 The petition said that this order of the Office of Land and Development is illegal, unconstitutional, arbitrary, malicious and full of jurisdiction

 Now Viswajit Rane of Goa, who recently left the Congress and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, has targeted Rahul
 vishwajit kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ek gambhir netaa nahin hai, vah ek non syrius leader hai
 Vishwajit said that if the Congress is led by Rahul, then in 2019, it will be reduced to only 20 seats
 rahul tak pahunchnaa kaaphi mushkilvishwajit rane ne kaha kiraahul gandhi tak pahunchnaa kafimushkil he, vah hamaare rajya kii janata ke prati gambhir nahin he

 The Congress, despite being the largest party in the state, could not form the government, due to which he was very angry
 rane ne iske baad vidhansabha seat or congress se istipha de diya, vah bijepi main shaamil ho gayi
 According to Rane, the Congress led by Rahul has turned directionless, if the party goes ahead like this, the number of seats will fall from 44 to 20
 unhone kaha ki agle 10 varshon tak congress kaa koi bhavishya nahin he, unhone digvijay singh ke bare main kaha ki unhen dekhakar aisa lagata he ki vah chaahate nahin the ki goa main congress kii sarkaar bane
 The BJP had formed the government, despite the fact that despite being the largest party in the recent elections in Goa, the Congress continued to shake hands and the BJP formed a government under Parrikar under the leadership of all the smaller parties
 congress ke goa prabharee digvijay singh hai
 It is alleged that Digvijay did not show activeness to form the party government and gave BJP a chance
 congress kii ore se sarkaar banavaane ke liye digvijay singh pahunche the, to vahiin bijepi ne kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ko goa bheja tha
 It was Gadkari who created an atmosphere in favor of BJP after talking to all regional parties

 This is revealed in a shocking study
 haalanki isi adhyayan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki adhik vajani hona utana hi hanikaarak ho saktaa he, jitna ki dhumrapaan karnaa

 The researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003 to 2010) of about 4000 people for this study
 unke shodh main pataa chalaa he ki jo log adhik mote hai, unki umr ke aath saal kam ho sakate hai

 In Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district, an illegal coal mine collapsed and 15 workers have been stranded for the last 15 days, politics has started
 13 disambar kii subah is khadaan main achaanak pani bad jane kii vajah se khanan kaary main lage majdoor baahar nahin nikal paae
 The NDRF team was continuously engaged in the rescue of these workers, but could not succeed
 bachaav dal kaa maananaa he ki khanan ke liye banaai gai sankari surang main pani bhar jane se fanse mazdooron tak pahunchaa nahin ja saktaa
 At present, 10 pumps of 100 horsepower are needed to extract the water that is in the mine
 lekin bachaav dal ke paas 25 horse power ke sirf do pump maujuud hai
 According to the information so far, the situation is very difficult for rescue work
 kyonki khadaan main pani bhar jane se na majdoor nikal paa rahe hai or na hi bachaav dal in tak pahunch paa rahaa he
 According to locals, almost all the water in the river near the mine has entered the mine
 pichley do hafton se chal rahe is bachaav kaary main ab tak khadaan main se 20 lakh litre pani nikaale jane kii sambhaavna he
 But the water level of the mine continues to rise
 sarkaar hai power pump kii vyavastha karne main juty he
 But the arrangement has not been done yet
 vahiin, is sankat kii ghadi main raajnneeti bhi shuru ho gai he
 First Congress President Rahul Gandhi wrote in a tweet, 'for the last two weeks 15 laborers have been fighting for breath in the coal mine filled with water
 is bich, pradhanmantri bogibil pul par camaron ke saamne poj dete hue akadakar chalate hai
 His government refused to arrange high pressure pumps for rescue, Prime Minister, please save the laborers
 ’rahul gandhi ke is twit ke jawaab main meghalaya ke mukhyamantri conrad sangama ne likhaa, 'andiaraf or rajya sarkaar lagaataar rescue oparation main juty he
 The scale of operation is a major challenge, as the river water has entered the mine
 bharat sarkaar ne rescue oparation main madad karne liye sabase behtareen logon ko bhajkar tatparta dikhaai he
 At the same time, in response to Rahul Gandhi, Union Minister Kiran Rijiju tweeted and wrote, 'rahul Gandhi ji please do not politicize this tragedy
 ham har sambhav tareeke se rajya sarkaar kii madad kar rahe hai
 But this unsafe illegal mining was being done due to the negligence of previous Congress governments
 'congress ke netaa ech

 On 13 December, 20 miners entered this mine 370 feet deep, out of which 5 workers came out before filling the water
 jo 15 majdoor abhi bhi andar fanse hai unamem se 7 meghalaya ke pashchim gaaro hills jile ke hai, jabaki 5 assam or 3 purvi jayantiya hills jile ke lumachari gaanv ke bataae ja rahe hai

 bharat ne somvaar ko faisla kiya ki vah 16 deshon ke arshep (RCEP) vyapaar samjhaute kaa hissaa nahin banegaa
 India said it was not running away from opening the doors to global competition in all sectors, but offered a strong argument for an outcome that suited all countries and all sectors
 sutron ke anusaar, RCEP shikhar sammelan main apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha, "RCEP samjhaute kaa maujuuda swaroop RCEP kii buniyadi bhaavana or maanya maardarshak siddhanton ko puri tarah jaahir nahin karata he
 It also does not satisfactorily address India's long-standing issues and concerns in the current situation
 "desh ke kisaanon, vyapaariyon, peshewaron or udyogon or shramikon or upabhoktaaon kaa hawala dete hue, jo aise faislon se prabhavit hote hai, unhone kaha - jab main sabhi bharatiyon ke hiton ke sambandh main aarasieepi samjhaute ko maapta hum, to mujhe sakaaratmak jawaab nahin miltaa he
 Therefore my conscience does not allow me to join RCEP
 sutron ne kaha ki aarasieepi main bharat kaa rukh pradhanmantri narendra modi ke majboot netritv or duniya main bharat ke badhate kad ko darshata he
 This decision of India will help Indian farmers, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and dairy sector
 sutron ne kaha ki is manch par bharat kaa rukh kaaphi vyaavhaarik rahaa he
 While India talked about the protection of the interests of the poor, it also tried to give a position of profit to the service sector of the country
 sutron ne bataaya ki bharat ne vibhinn kshetron main vaishvik pratispardhaa ko kholane main koi hichkichaahat nahin dikhaai
 Along with this, it was strongly emphasized that whatever the result of this should be favorable to all countries and all regions

 For China, it would be helpful in balancing trade between the effects of the ongoing trade war with America
 saath hi vah pashchimi deshon ko kshetra kii aarthik takat kaa bhi andaja kara paata
 India was strongly raising the issue of market access for its products in this conversation
 bharat mukhyataur par apane gharelu bazaar ko bachaane ke liye kuch vastuon kii sangrakshit suchi ko lekar bhi majboot rukh apanaaye huye tha
 Many industries in the country fear that if India signs this agreement, there will be a flood of cheap Chinese agricultural and industrial products in the domestic market
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘‘bharat vyapak kshetreey ekikaran ke saath mukt vyapaar or niyam aadhaarit antarrashtriya vyavastha kaa pakshdhar he

 "when we look around us, during the seven-year RCEP negotiations, many things have changed, including the global economic and trade scenario," Modi said
 ham in badlaavon kii andekhi nahin kar sakate
 Meanwhile, trade experts have said that India's decision not to join the RCEP would protect the domestic industry from unfair competition
 bhartiya videsh vyapaar santhaan (ift) main professor rakesh mohan joshi ne kaha, ‘‘is kadam se spasht he ki bharat saavdhaanee se apane udyog tathaa kisaanon ko anuchit pratispardhaa se sangrakshan par vichaar kar rahaa he
 This will bring great relief to the dairy sector
 ''niryaatkon ke sanghathan fio ke purv adhyaksh es si ralhan ne bhi is faisle kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki ispaat or kuch ejineering companiyon ne qaraar ko lekar apni aapatti jataai thi

 ''asian netaaon or chah anya deshon ne november, 2012 main cambodia kii rajdhani nom peh main 21wein asian shikhar sammelan ke dauraan aarasieepi vaartaon kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The purpose of starting the RCEP negotiations was to enter into a modern, comprehensive, high-quality and mutually beneficial economic partnership agreement
 modi ne kaha, ‘‘jab main aarasieepi qaraar ko sabhi bharatiyon ke hiton se jodakar dekhtaa hum, to mujhe sakaaratmak jawaab nahin miltaa
 In such a situation, neither Gandhi jantar nor my own conscience allows me to join the RCEP

 Singh said, "our decision has been taken on the basis of the assessment of the current global situation and that the agreement is not fair and balanced
" bharat ke kai pramukh mudde the jinhen hal nahin kiya gaya
 Sources said the increase in imports in the negotiations did not address issues such as inadequate protection, lack of reliable assurances to India on market access, non-duty bottlenecks, potential violations of rules by some countries and differences in trade with China

 Asked if India could join the RCEP at a later stage, Secretary (east) in the Ministry of External Affairs, Singh said that India has decided not to join it
 aarasieepi deshon ne bayaan main kaha ki bharat ke kai mudde the, jinka samaadhaan nahin ho paaya
 The RCEP comprises ten ASEAN countries and their six free trade partners China, India, Japan, South, Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand
 haalanki, bharat ne ab aarasieepi se baahar nikalne kaa faisla kiya he
 If the RCEP agreement was finalized it would have become the largest free trade area in the world

 This decision of India will protect the interest of Indian farmers, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and dairy products
 sutron ne kaha ki yah pehla mauka nahin he jabaki pradhanmantri modi kii aguwai main bharat ne antarrashtriya vyapaar or usase sambandhit vaartaon main kadaa rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 US President Donald Trump has also described Modi as a difficult negotiator
 haalanki, trump ko khud bhi sakht rukh apnaane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Government sources said, "now those days wind up when Indian negotiators used to come under pressure in front of global powers on trade issues
 is baar bharat ‘front foot' par khelaa he or usne vyapaar ghate ko lekar desh kii chintaaon ko uthaaya he
 At the same time, India has also pressurized other countries to further open their markets for Indian services and investment

 Sources said that due to these decisions taken during the UPA, India's trade deficit with the countries of RCEP, which was $ 7 billion in 2004, reached $ 78 billion in 2014

 NAFU and its acceptance etc
 The Central Government has recently constituted a High Level Expert Committee to address the grievances of all services

 Significantly, in February, a contempt petition was filed in the Delhi High Court to enforce the Supreme Court's decision to give the benefit of Organized Group a Service and NFU to the officers of Central Paramilitary Forces and their cadres

 For this, the government had made the basis of the subject of the ongoing elections and busy officials etc

 On the other hand, the concerned officials of the Central Paramilitary Forces at this time expressed surprise on the ways of formation of the committee suddenly, that when the matter has already been decided before the judicial process, then with the formation of such a committee, the government will somewhere in the matter It is in the process of delaying and bringing a new proposal on it, which can become an obstacle in direct compliance with court orders

 However, there is no mention of central paramilitary forces in any process related to the formation of the committee and its recommendation

 Nowhere in this order of dopt is there any definition of definition regarding the cadre of IAS officers, while they also come under the purview of Organized Services and NFU and they earn the most from it

 During the rjd's executive meeting in Patna on Sunday, party supremo Lalu Prasad has indicated that his successor will be his son
 haalanki unhone is dauraan donon beton main se kisi ek kaa naam nahin liya
 According to sources, Pappu Yadav started discussing the party's successor in the executive meeting

 This is because Lalu Prasad himself cannot contest elections after being convicted in the fodder scam case
 isliye yah tay karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki janata parivaar or november main hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav main argedy kaa cheharaa koun hoga
 Is Misa Bharti giving competition to the brothers! By the way, during the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections, Lalu Yadav had announced that his youngest son Tejashwi Yadav would be his successor

 However, his political debut was poor

 But if sources are to be believed, Rabri Devi wants her elder son Tej Pratap to be made Lalu Yadav his successor

 The success of this romantic drama film made the country crazy for Aamir Khan
 lekin 30 saal baad aamir khan ne bataaya he ki wo apni debyue film main kiye gaye kaam se khush nahin the
 In an interview recently, the actor said that even today i am not happy with that work
 maine diarector ko ye bhi kaha tha ki film dobaaraa shoot kii jaae
 Aamir told that i thought everyone would like Juhi's work, nobody would like my work
 jab film hit ho gai to aamir ne kaha ki main hairaan tha
 This was my fate, people liked my work
 bataa den bollywood kii romantic filmon main se ek 'qayaamat se qayaamat tak' ko 30 saal pehle 29 april 1988 main relies kiya gaya tha
 She also had Juhi Chawla in the lead role in the film

 But Juhi refused to kiss
 juhi ke inkaar ke baad film ke diarector mansoor khan ne shooting kareeb 10 minute ke liye roak di thi
 He was so upset that he told the whole unit that there would be no work, stop it all
 shooting rukne ke baad juhi ko seen ke bare main samajhaayaa gaya
 Eventually, after a while, Juhi realized that this was the demand of the script and he said yes to the scene

 The Royal Challengers Bangalore team performed poorly in the 10th IPL
 nishchit taur par is ipel ko royal chalangers bangalore bhula dena chaahegi
 However, the three-time runners-up farewell
 apane aakhri match main royal chalangers bangalore ne dilli dairedevills ko 10 ranon se haraa diya
 But this team will always remember his embarrassing performance in this edition of IPL, in which he got the chance to taste the victory only three times
 yah baat sahi he ki is lachar pradarshan ke liye team kaa har ballebaaj jimmedaar he lekin jab team main vishwa kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaj ho to nigahen or dimag usase hatate hi nahin
 Yes yes 
 
 baat ho rahi he team ke captain or international cricket main recordon kii line laga dene vaale viraat kohli kii
 In the 10th IPL, Virat Kohli played 10 matches in which he was able to score only 308 runs
 308 ranon main unke chaar ardhashatak shaamil hai
 He had missed the first three matches of the tournament due to a shoulder injury
 pichley varsh 13 maichon main unhone chaar shatak or saat ardhashatak ke saath kul 973 ran thoke the
 It would not be wrong to say that Virat Kohli's brilliant performance played a key role in leading the team to the finals in 2016
 lekin is varsh team anka talika main sabase neeche he
 The comments 2011 ke baad se agar viraat kohli ke batting record par najar daalen to is varsh unka sabase kharaab pradarshan rahaa
 However, even between 2008 and 2010, Virat Kohli could not show any special feat
 unka score 2008 main 165, 2009 main 246 or 2010 main 307 tak hi simit rahaa tha
 But Virat was not the best batsman in the world at that time
 cricketpremiyon kii nigahen un par abhi jitani nahin rahati thim
 If you talk about the average, then Virat's game was worse in 2014 and 2012 than in 2017

 He has advised his players not to pay too much attention to criticism
 lenger ke anusaar, jab sachin ne australia ke khilaaf cricket khelaa, vah alag yug tha

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko kaha ki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke videsh dauron par janata kii gadhi kamai ke 1,880 karod rupe kharch hone kaa unka aarope yadi galat sabit hua, to vah maafee maangane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Modi said, 'I said this based on the news of a newspaper
 agar meri soochna galat he to aaj main kahata hum ki is bhul ke liye main saarvajanik rup se maafee maangoonga
 Earlier Modi had targeted the Congress president at a rally in Jaisar, claiming that his foreign tours had cost Rs 1880 crore and it was the taxpayer's hard earned money
 apni bhul ke liye maang luungaa maafiah narendra modijunagarh kii raily main modine kaha ki haryana ke hisar main ek yuvak ko mili artiai ke tahat ek jawaab ko is saal 12 july ko ek akhbaar main prakashit kiya gaya or unka aarope isi par aadhaarit he
 However, a youth named Ramesh Sharma questioned the data given by Modi, saying that he had not received any reply to his RTI application
 jesar main modi ne kaha, ‘meri sarkaar par behisaab kharch kaa aarope lagane vaale congressi mitron se main poochna chahta hum ki kya yah sach nahin he ki congress adhyaksh ke videsh dauron par pichley teen saal main 1,880 karod rupe kharch kiye gaye
 He said, 'this means that if the total annual budget of Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh and Rajkot Municipal Corporation is combined, then this amount was spent only on Sonia's foreign tours and stay in their luxury hotels
 ’tasveeron main dekhen narendra modi kaa jivan
 
 
 Modi, who was on a state visit a month before the assembly elections, said at the rally, 'I want to know from Delhi Sultanate what is the compulsion that they have to allow the poor people of the country to spend money arbitrarily
 ’ sonia gandhi rajya main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye buudhvaar ko rajkot main kisaanon ko sambodhit kar prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karengi
 This will be Sonia's first visit to an election state
 artiai kaaryakarta ramesh sharma ne samprag adhyaksh ke videsh daure par sarkari khajaane se 1,880 karod rupe kharch kiye jane ke modi ke daawey par sawaal uthaaya
 Sharma said in Hisar, 'modi has said Rs 1880 crore
 sarkaar ne is par koi pratikriya nahin di
 i did not get any such information under RTI application
 mujhe 1880 karod rupe kaa koi aankada nahin mila
 i do not know from where Modi is referring to this
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main kah saktaa hum ki maine 1880 karod rupe kaa koi aankada nahin diya kyonki mujhe aisi koi soochna hi nahin mili
 On the other hand, the Congress has termed Modi's allegations as false
 party ke pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha, ‘yah afsosjanak he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri aisa jhooth bol rahe hai or yah jhooth hisar ke artiai kaaryakarta ke rahasyodghatan se jaahir ho gaya
 It is evident that this is an attempt to divert the attention of the people from the real issues present in Gujarat

 jaayra wasim
 One such actress who called Hindi cinema in the name of Allah is 'alvida'
 jaayra kaa filmi safar 5 saal main teen filmon kaa hi he
 Zaira's third film 'the Sky is Pink' is in the loop
 lekin jaayra ne filmon se kahin zyada surkhiyaan vivaadon se batori hai
 The actress, who came into the discussion due to controversy from the beginning, ended her journey with controversy on June 30
 jaayra ne 30 june ko 6 pannon ke ghoshnaa patr main film industry chhodane kaa elaan kar diya
 Of course, this was his personal matter, but in the name of Allah, he had to cry out to everyone to ask for a career
 isaki ek nahin hajaar vajahen hai
 Zaira, how did she forget that the Hindi cinema is of those actresses who have made their mark by breaking the restrictions
 madhubala, minaa kumari, wahidaa rahamaan, jinat amaan to industry ke wo naam hai jin par har majahab ko garv he
 He never called for religion
 yahaan tak kii unki adaakaari ne ye ehsaas tak nahin hone diya ki wo kis majahab ko maanati hai
 But where is your wisdom to leave the film industry in the name of religion? Zira, how did you forget that not only the cinema in the country, women of Kashmir have taken the front in every region
 der raat daftar, aspataalon main kaam karne vaali na jane kitni karashmiri mahilaayein hai jo apni duty ko puraa kar rahi hai
 But are they not God? Should everyone quit their work to walk on the path of God? Is this the only way to earn patience? By the way, Zaira was seen as a weak person when you met Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti
 us vakt bhi samaaj ke chand thekedaaron ne aapako mahaj mulaakaat ke liye trol kiya tha
 At a time when there was a chance to give a strong reply, you gave an apology
 off
 For your information, let me tell you that the whole country was with you at that time
 tamaam celibrity the
 Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti himself supported you
 lekin aapke maafeename ne dharm or samaaj ke un thekedaaron ko sahi sabit kiya jo ye bataate hai ki mahilaon kii had kya he
 Zaira This step of yours has given rise to the wrong traditions that show the extent of women
 unhen to bas burke main lipatakar, ghar kii dahalij ke andar deevaaron main kaid rahanaa chahie he, phir chaahe unka dam hi kyon nahin ghut jaae
 Writer Taslima Nasreen's tweet also pointed to this, in which she wrote - "many talents of the Muslim community are forced to go into the darkness of the burqa
" "vaise jaayra aapane ye kaha hota ki industry main tamaam khamiyaan hai, yahaan kaam karnaa mushkil he, aapako spes chahie, aapke saath galat hua
 So the whole country would be with you
 aapke haq kii ladaai ham sab milakar lard rahe hote
 But it is impossible to accept the cry of abandoning the Hindi cinema in the name of religion
 ho saktaa he ki asal vajah koi or ho, aap par kai bandishen hon, jinka zikr 6 pannon main nahin ho sakaa
 Well till yesterday, Zaira, whom we considered to be our secret superstar, is a junkie in her own restrictions
 hindi cinema main hone ke liye iske kaabil hona bhi jaruri he
 Maturity is required to get a tick here, for which neither you are capable nor your age

 Hara degi aapko!! https: / / t
 co / tskgnwdxfr ems filmkeval babagurmeet ram rahim ko hi dekhnichahie
 There are eight reasons for this
 1
 One should be free from criminal charges first — before promoting himself as a messenger of God, Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim should be concerned about removing the criminal charges he is facing
 baba apane aap ko ishwar se judaa koi vyakti kaise bataa sakate hai jabaki unke upar balaatkaar, hatya or apane anuyaayiyon ko bade paimaane par napunsak banane ke aapraadhik maamle chal rahe hai
 2
 film andhvishwaas ko badhaava degi-ems film main ishwar kaa sandeshvahak banakar gurmeet ram rahim chamatkaar dikhaate hue bimariyon kaa ilaaj karte nazar aaenge
 Sant Rampal of Haryana also used such tricks to fool his followers
 wo sabhi rogon ko dur karne ke liye chamatkaari pani bech rahaa tha
 Look how he did
 3
 The film is only for a particular audience - Gurmeet Ram Rahim is neither a big religious leader nor a film actor
 wo apane lakhon anuyaayiyon ke bich lokapriy ho sakate hai
 But they are not for the whole society
 ye film keval unke wo anuyaayi dekhenge jinhone film ke nirmaataa kii madad karne ke liye pehle se hi tikat book kara rakhen hai
 4
 sampradayik tanaav ho saktaa he-agar ye film release hoti he to punjab or haryana main sampradayik tanaav ho saktaa he
 Radical Sikh leaders and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee have warned of protests in the state on the release of this film
 5
 This film will mislead people - according to a member of the censor board, Gurmeet Ram Rahim has presented himself like a god in the film, while he describes himself as a common man
 board sadsy ne is film ko baba ram rahim kaa ek vigyaapan hi bataaya he
 a common man who believes in miracles will be seen innocent by Baba
 indian neshnal lokdal ke netaa digvijay chautaala ne kaha ki jis tarah se baba film main logon ko peet rahe hai usase aatank failega
 6
 kar chori-inelo kii khojbin ke mutabik hakeekat antertanment privet limited ne 60 karod rupye ke film tikat beche hai or kareeb 15 karod rupye kii manoranjan kar kii chori kii he
 What a miracle is this? 7
 film banane ke liye daan kaa durupyog-gurmeet ram rahim ne is film ko banane main anuyaayiyon se mili daan kaa durupyog kiya he
 The INLD says that the donated money of followers has been invested in the creation of MSG and the Dera Sacha Sauda takes income tax exemption on that money
 8
 Why hurry to approve the next part of this film? —sensor Board did not pass the main film itself
 deraa se jude log film ke agle bhaag yani sikval kii shooting tezi ke saath puri karne main jute hai
 The Dera chief himself has said that 60 percent shooting of the sequel of this film has been completed
 gurmeet kaa kahana he ki unhone ye film thilacemia ke marizon kii madad ke liye banaai he
 So instead of making a film, why not ask his followers to give money directly to help those patients? haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda dwaara haal hi main kii gai vivaadaaspad niyuktiyon ko radd karne kii bijepi kii maang par haryana ke rajyapal captain singh solanki ne bhupinder singh sarkaar se jawaab maanga he
 The Haryana Raj Bhavan official said that the BJP submitted a memorandum to the governor on July 30, which was sent to the state government for comment

 28 july ko nae rajyapal ke pad sanbhaalane ke ek ghante baad hi hooda ne in adhikariyon ko shapath dilwakar vivaad ko janm de diya tha
 Accusing the Hooda government of not following the rules and adequate procedures, the BJP had said that as per the constitution, appointment letters should be issued before the oath is administered
 lekin hooda sarkaar ne isaki parvaah hi nahin kii
 The BJP had also demanded registration of an FIR against the then Chief Secretary SC Chaudhary, saying that he allegedly pressurized senior IAS officer Pradeep Kasani to do the wrongdoings related to the appointments
 haalanki choudhary kehete rahe hai ki niyuktiyaan karne or unhen shapath dilaane main kuch bhi avaidh nahin tha
 The names of newly appointed people were approved by former Governor Jagannath Pahadia on July 25, the last day of his term

 The Congress termed the swearing in of Chief Minister to Devendra Fadnavis in the unprecedented political developments in Maharashtra with the mandate as betrayal and betrayal of democracy

 Should such laws be brought in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha also? Will have to see this further

 Resources are low, so if the country has to move forward then population control will have to be considered

 The South Delhi MCD has issued a decree not to hang non-veg items outside the restaurant or to be kept on display
 ab aapako restaurant ke baahar items ke posters hi dikhenge
 Under the new proposal of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, there is an order not to hang non-veg in the display in front of all non-veg restaurants and shops falling in the municipal area
 south dilli nagar nigam keis farmaan ko lekar tarkadiya ja rahaa he ki khule main latakaane se maance main dhul or makkhiyaan lag jaati hai jo sehat ke liye thik nahin he
 After this order we talked to non-veg restaurants and shopkeepers in big markets like New Friends Colony, CR Park and Kalkaji 
 zyaadaatar dukandaaron kaa yah kahana he ki is aadesh kaa paalan karne se hamaari cell 20% tak jarur gir jaaegi
 The manager of New Friends Colony's renowned non-veg restaurant, Al Beck, says the notice has not yet been received
 jaisaadesh hoga paalan karnaapadegaa
 So at the same time, Chawla restaurant of NFC has said that after removing the display, the business will be reduced by 30 to 35 percent
 saath hi ye bhi tark diya kii jo dikhataa he wo bikta he
 Shaheen, who is tasting the noise in Albeck on this issue, says that you are going somewhere and you see that if you get the noise then you will stop and eat but if you only have a poster, you probably won't even notice
 nonvej khaane kii shaukeen swati ne kaha ki nongegeterian ko dikkat to hogi kyonki poster se wo baat to nahin aegi
 Hunger increases after viewing
 vahiin vegeterian kehete hai ki jab nonvej item poster main dikhegaa tab pareshaani nahin or na hi is tarah ke restaurant se unhen najar churaakar nikalnaa padegaa
 However, on the issue of health, if this applies to non-veg as well as wedge, it would be good
 zyaadaatar dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki abhi tak vah nonvej kaa disple kaanch kii almaari ke andar lagaate the jisase usamen dhul yaa gandagi jane kaa koi khatra nahin rahata he vah keval disple ke taur par hi lagaaya gaya he aise main usseemsidi ko bhala kya pareshaniho sakati he
 Desperate shopkeepers say that he will follow this decree and will work from the poster itself

 sharten lagu The stir has intensified in his country over the visit of US President Obama
 desh chahta he ki america bharat kaa sachcha ranneetik bhagidaar sabit ho, par kai kaarnon kii yah aas dhoomil najar aa rahi he
 The reason behind this is that they are not able to execute the work in the manner that Obama speaks
 mumkin he, iske peeche america kii kuch vivashataaen hon, par obama kaa daura puraa hue bina aashaaon kaa daaman choda bhi nahin ja saktaa
 However, know what is the opinion of the editors on this issue
 
 
 prabhu chawlajo baat america ke logon ko bahut pehle hi pataa chal chuki he, vah ab bharatiyon ko bhi maaloom ho jaaegi
 That is, US President Barack Obama does not perform his work as efficiently as he makes a speech
 pichley dinon unhone pitiai ko die saakshaatkaar main sweekaar kiya ki isamen koi achraj kii baat nahin hogi agar ve bharat kii ummiido par bhi khare na utar saken
 Nevertheless, we will give him a grand welcome later this week
 obama bhi thik-thaak haavbhaav dikhaane ke saath-saath sahi baaten karegein, magar hameshaa kii tarah ve apane vaayadon ko kabhi puraa nahin karenge
 We hope Ajay Kumar
 
 
 ummid he ek nae or shantipurna america kii
 
 
 'with these things, when President Barack Obama was addressing the country two years ago, he also referred to Gandhi's ideals and the emerging new picture of India in the world
 diwali ke der raat raashtrapati obama mumbai pahunch rahe hai
 Will this be the beginning of a new light or will the india-us relationship remain the status quo
 
 
 yah agle teen dinon main saaf ho jayega
 In the initial phase of taking over the reins of Rahul Kanwalasatta, Barack Obama looked like a breath of fresh air
 ek aisi bayaar, jisamen america or puri duniya kii dasha or disha ko sudhaar dene kaa madda ho
 The slogan he raised was heard throughout the world
 lakhon log unke hi swar main bolne ko taiyaar ho gaye-'haa, ham aisa kar sakate hai
 'but the government does not run with just hope and pleasant winds
 baraak obama ke netritv ke do saal main america or duniya ab yah samajhane lagi he ki keval kushal vaktaa hona hi behatar raashtrapati hone kii guarantee nahin he
 Bharat Bhushan is witnessing a lot of stir in the media about the visit of American President Barack Obama to India
 is maukey par sabase ahm sawaal yah he ki obama ke bharat daure kii safalataa yaa vifaltaa kaa nirnay kaise kiya jaae? vaise sarkari-tantra se jude bade ranneetikaar bhi is daure ko lekar utsahit nahin hai
 They claim that Obama's visit is not going to produce any far-reaching results
 spasht he ki ye daure se kuch khaas ummid nahin rakh rahe hai
 Despite this, until the time of Obama's arrival and return to India, the pages of newspapers will be painted in the color of Obama and the 'small curtain' will also look obsolete

 akbarajab koi khaas mudda logon ke mastishk or media main bad-chadhakar chaane lage, to uski vastusthiti kii jaanch karnaa lajimi ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is necessary to test it on the test of practicality rather than expectations and possibilities
 kya obama apane shaantikalin mitra bharat se achche rishte banane ke liye yudhkalin mitra pakistan ko chhod denge? pakistan ko washington ke bazaar se ekmaatr cheez chahie or vah he- hathiyaar
 If he needs anything else, it's hard cash
 jo hathiyaar pashchimi front par puraane ho gaye maaloom padate hai, vahi hathiyaar purvi front par samrik drushtikon se mahatvapurn maane jate hai, jahaan kashmir ghati kaa mudda abhi bhi garam he
 The 11 players with whom Team India landed on the field in the World Cup match against Bangladesh at Edgbaston, Birmingham, included four wicketkeepers
 mahendra singh dhoni ke paas wicketcaping kii jimmedaari rahi, lekin unke alaava team main rishabh pant, dinesh karthik or keel rahul bhi wicketcaping main visheshgyata rakhte hai
 Rahul played a regular wicketkeeper for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 yah pehla avasar nahin, jab kisi antarrashtriya match main itane saare wicketcaping ke visheshgy khilaadi maidan par utre

 There have also been cases of lynching in the country due to rumors and fake news spreading on whatsapp
 sarkaar ne watsap se is plateform par chal raheen aisi khabaron ko rokane ko bhi kaha
 After this, the company asked people not to spread fake news and rumors through advertisements
 isi kram main watsap ne massej forward opshan ko bhi limit kiya
 Only five people were offered the option of forwarding messages at a time
 isse pehle ek saath kai logon ko massej forward kiye ja sakate the
 Not only this, the company also gave forward label in front of the forwarded messages or files so that people can check and trust it
