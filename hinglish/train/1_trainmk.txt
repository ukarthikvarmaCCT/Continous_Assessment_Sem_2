 Today, after all the government and routine programs, the road to Rajghat should have been opened for those who wanted to go there with their demands

 It is also for the speech of farmers
 dilli kisaanon se dur jaaegi,to kisaan dilli aaenge hi
 If the road was not blocked, the farmers would come in comfort and leave

 From industrialists running away with thousands of crores to millions of crores of loans through technical accounts, there would have been some such for farmers too
 itane dinon se kisaan padayatra kar rahe hai
 He could talk to them in the middle way, not done
 ab dilli kii seemaa par rokkar kya faaydaa

 Recently he suggested that Indian players should leave IPL in view of their fitness ratio

 unhone kaha, "main congress main ghutan mahasoos kar rahaa tha kyonki main apane samudaay ke garib logon ke vikaas ke liye kaam nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 Due to the immaturity and arrogance of its leaders in that party (congress), no work can be done

 In such a situation, it is prudent to withdraw money before the ATM machine is emptied

 Union Minister VK Singh termed the withdrawal of the award as a conspiracy citing intolerance by the authors and said that it was planned
 singh ne saath hi kaha ki jaipur sahitya mahotsav main karan johar kii loktantr evam abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par tippanee prachaar hasil karne or samachar main bane rahane ke liye thi or use 'mahatv nahin diya janaa chahie
 Regarding the relationship with Pakistan, he said, "the process of dialogue to resolve bilateral issues should not be affected by events like Pathankot
" 'tippaniyandrasal jaipur sahitya sammelan main apni kitaab 'en ansuteble bvoy' ke vimochan ke dauraan karan ne kaha tha ki 'aap man kii baat kahana chaahate hai yaa apni nijee jindagi ke raaj kholana chaahate hai to bharat sabase mushkil desh he
 'he also said' i feel as if a legal notice always follows me
 kisi ko pataa nahin kab uske khilaaf exiaar darj ho jaae
 ' is maukey par karan ne kaha '14 saal pehle maine rashtriya gaan ke apmaan ke cese ko jhela he
 It is both a joke to keep your personal opinion and talk about democracy
 ham vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii baat karte hai, lekin agar main ek celibrity hone ke naate apni raay rakh bhi duun to ek bada vivaad khadaa ho jaataa he
 In fact, during the release of his book 'an Unsettable Boy' at the Jaipur Literature Conference, Karan had said that 'if you want to tell your mind or unravel the secrets of your personal life, India is the most difficult country
 ' unhone saath hi kaha 'mujhe to lagata he jaise hameshaa koi legal notice meraa peechha karata rahata he
 No one knows when an FIR is lodged against him
 ' On this occasion, Karan said, '14 years ago i have faced a case of insulting the national anthem
 apni nijee raay rakhana or prajatantr kii baat karnaa, ye donon hi mazaaq hai
 We talk about the expression of ideas, but if i give my opinion as a celebrity, then a big controversy arises

 ' On the second day of India Today Conclave 2017, politics, cinema and all other giants gathered from the country and the world on the stage
 sabhi diggajon ne manch par apni raay rakhi, pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi video conferencing ke jariye conklev kaa hissaa bane
 PM Modi said many big things in the Conclave
 neeche padhein:sabase pehle aap sabhi ko is aayojan ke liye bahut-bahut badhai-shubhakamanaayen
 i have had an opportunity to join the India Today Conclave earlier
 mujhe bataaya gaya he ki kal india today group ke editor in chif ne mujhe nayaa pad de diya he- 'diserptor- in-chif' kaa
 For two days, you guys have been churning on 'the Great Disruption'
 dosto, anek dashakon tak ham galat nitiyon ke saath galat disha main chale
 This sentiment became strong by the government
 kai dashakon ke baad galati dhyaan main ai
 There was an attempt to rectify the mistake and the limit of thinking was just that two decades ago there was an attempt to correct the mistake and it was accepted as a reform
 zyaadaatar samay desh ne yaa to ek hi tarah kii sarkaar dekhi yaa phir mili-juli
 Due to this, the country saw only one set of thinking or activity
 pehle political system se janmi election driven hoti thi yaa phir beuroperesi ke rigid fremawork par aadhaarit thi
 These were the two systems of government run and the government was also assessed on this basis
 hamen sweekaar karnaa hoga ki 200 saal main technology jitani badali, usase zyada pichley 20 saal main badali he
 One has to accept that there is a lot of difference between the aspirations of the youth of 30 years and the youth of today
 sweekaar karnaa hoga ki Bipolar World or Inter-dependent world kii sabhi equations badal chuki hai
 If we look at the period of freedom movement, it had more national aspiration than personal aspiration
 uski tivrata itani thi ki usne desh ko saikadon saalon kii gulaami se baahar nikaala
 Now is the need of the hour - the movement of development like the freedom movement - which should expand personal aspiration to collective aspiration and collective aspiration should be the all round development of the country
 ye sarkaar ek bharat-shreshth bharat kaa sapana lekar chal rahi he
 The approach is different on how to look for problems
 bahut saal tak desh main angreji-hindi par sangharsh hota rahaa
 All the languages of India are our property
 dhyaan diya gaya ki sabhi bhashaaon ko ekta ke sutara main kaise baandha jaae
 In one india-shreshtha Bharat program, two states got pairing and now the states are getting to know about each other's cultural diversity
 yani chijen badal rahi hai or tarika alag he
 So your word is getting short for all these things
 ye vyavasthaaon ko dhwast karne vaali soch nahin he
 This is a rejuvenation so that the soul of this country remains intact, the arrangements should be adapted to the times
 yahi 21veen sadi ke janamanas kaa man he
 Therefore, if there is a 'disaster-in-chief', there are 125 crore Indians in the country
 jo hindustan ke jan-man se judaa he wo bhalee-bhaanti samaj jayega ki diserptor koun he
 Tied-together thoughts, the way the things are still seen the old way is that some people feel that the world changes from the corridor of power
 aisa sochna galat he
 We have associated time bound implementation and integrated thinking with the work-culture of the government
 kaam karne kaa aisa tarika jahaan system main transperency ho, processes ko citizen friendly or development friendly banaaya jaae, efficiency laane ke liye process ko re-engineer kiya jaae
 Friends, today India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world
 world investment report main bharat ko duniya kii top teen prospective host iconomi main aanka gaya he
 The year 2015-16 saw a record investment of over $ 55 billion

 Make in India has become India's largest initiative today
 aaj bharat duniya kaa chatha sabase bada manuphaccharing desh he
 Friends, this government emphasizes cooperative federalism
 GST aaj jahaan tak pahunchaa he, wo dailyberative demokrasi kaa parinaam he jisamen har rajya ke saath samvaad hua
 Agreeing on the GST is an important outcome but its process is equally important
 ye aisa nirnay he jo aamasahmati se hua he
 All states have taken ownership of it together
 aapke nazariye se ye disrpative ho saktaa he, lekin GST darasal Federal structure ke nai oonchai par pahunchane kaa saboot he
 The development of everyone is not just a slogan, it is being shown by living
 dosto, hamaare desh main varshon se mana gaya ki labour laws vikaas main baadhak hai
 On the other hand it was also believed that there are anti-labor reformers in labor laws
 yani donon extream sthiti thim
 Never thought of how to proceed with a holistic approach for all three of impliers, implants and aspirants
 desh main alag-alag shram-kanoonon ke paalan ke liye pehle emploir ko 56 alag-alag registeron main jaankaree bharani hoti thi
 The same information was repeatedly filled in different registers
 ab pichley maheene sarkaar ne notiphoi kiya he ki emploir ko labour laws ke tahat 56 nahin sirf 5 register maintain karne honge
 This will help entrepreneurs in making the business easy
 job market ke vistaar par bhi sarkaar kaa puraa dhyaan he
 Public Sector, Private Sector as well as the emphasis of the Government is also on the Personal Sector
 mudra yojana ke tahat naujavaanon ko bina bank guarantee karj diya ja rahaa he
 In the last two and a half years, over six crore people have been given more than three lakh crore loans under the Mudra scheme
 saamaanya dukaane or santhaan saal main puure 365 din khule rah saken uske liye bhi rajyon ko salaah di gai he
 For the first time, the Ministry of Skill Development is working on it with full planning

 Similarly, by improving the Apprenticeship Act, the number of apprentices has been increased and the stipends found during the course of the apprentices have also been increased
 saathiyo, sarkaar kii shakti se janashakti zyada mahatvapurn he
 On the platform of India Today Conclave, i have said before that it is not possible to run such a big country without adding people of the country
 bina desh kii janashakti ko saath liye aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he
 After the Diwali action against black money and corruption, all of you have seen such an example of manpower, which is seen only in times of war or in times of crisis
 ye janashakti isliye ekajute ho rahi he kyonki log apane desh ke bheetar vyaapt buraaiyon ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai, kamajoriyon ko haraakar aage badhanaa chaahate hai, ek New India bananaa chaahate hai
 If today more than 4 crore toilets have been built in the country under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, more than 100 districts have been declared open defecation free, then this is a proof of solidarity of this manpower
 agar ek karod se zyada log gas sabsidi kaa phayda uthaane se khud inkaar kar rahe hai to ye isi janashakti kaa udhaaharan he
 Therefore, it is necessary that public sentiments should be respected and decisions taken in the interest of the country by understanding the aspirations of the people and they should be completed on time
 jab sarkaar ne jandhan yojana shuru kii to kaha tha ki desh ke garibon ko banking system se jodenge
 Under this scheme, bank accounts of 27 crore poor have been opened so far
 isi tarah sarkaar ne lakshya rakhaa ki teen varsh main desh ke 5 karod garibon ko muft gas conection denge, sirf 10 maheene main hi lagbhag do karod garibon ko gas conection die bhi ja chuke hai
 The government had said that in one thousand days, electricity will be delivered to those 18 thousand villages, where even after 70 years of independence, there was no electricity
 lagbhag 650 din main hi 12 hajaar se zyada gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai ja chuki he
 Where rules and regulations needed to be changed, they were changed and where they needed to be abolished
 ab tak 1100 se zyada puraane kanoonon ko khatm kiya ja chukaa he
 Friends, for years the budget was presented in the country at 5 pm
 ye vyavastha angrejon ne banaai thi kyonki bharat main shaam kaa 5 baje britain ke hisaab se subah kaa saadhe 11 baje hota tha
 Atal ji changed it
 is varsh aapane dekha he ki bajet ko ek maheenaa pehle pesh kiya gaya
 This is a big change in terms of implementation
 varanaa isse pehle farvari ke aakhir main bajet aata tha or vibhaagon tak paise pahunchane main maheenon nikal jate the, phir iske baad monsoon kii vajah se kaam main or deree hoti thi
 Now the departments will get the funds allocated for their schemes on time
 isi tarah bajet main plan, non-plan kaa artificial partition tha
 Emphasis was given on new things to get into the headlines and what is already going on was ignored
 is vajah se dharaatal par bahut imbalance tha
 We have tried to make a big change by eliminating this artificial division
 is baar aam bajet main railway bajet kaa bhi vilay kiya gaya
 The system of presenting the railway budget separately was also made by the British
 ab transport ke aayam bahut badal chuke hai
 It is rail, road, aviation, water way, sea way, all of them need to think integrated way
 sarkaar kaa ye kadam transportesan sector main technological rivolution kaa aadhaar banegaa
 In the last two and a half years, you have seen the government's policy decisions and intentions
 main maanata hum New India ke liye yahi Approach 21veen sadi main desh ko nai oonchaaiyon par le jaaegi, New India kii neenv or majboot karegi
 Approach of most governments has been here - lighting lamps, cutting ribbons, and it was also considered as work, no one considered it bad
 aapako ye jaanakar hairaani hogi ki hamaare desh main 1500 se zyada nae projects kii ghoshnaa to huin lekin wo sirf filon main hi dabe rahe
 Many such big projects have been stuck for years
 ab pariyojnaon kii proper monitoring ke liye ek vyavastha deplev kii gai he- 'pragati' yani pro-active Governance and Timely impalimentation
 i sit in the Prime Minister's Office and the secretaries of all the central departments connect through video conferencing to the Chief Secretary of all the states, a list is already prepared for the projects which are on hold
 ab tak 8 lakh karod rupee se zyada kii pariyojnaon kii samiksha pragati kii baithkon main ho chuki he
 More than 150 big projects, which were stuck for years, are very important for the country, now they have gained momentum
 desh ke liye Next Generation Infrastructre par sarkaar kaa focus he
 In the last 3 budgets, the most money has been given to the rail and road sector, to increase their ability to work is being constantly monitored
 yahi vajah he ki rail or road, donon hi sector main kaam karne kii jo Average Speed thi, usamen kaaphi badhotaree hui he
 Earlier, the work of electrifiction of railways was slow
 sarkaar ne railway ke root-electrifiction kaarykram ko gati di
 This reduced the cost of running the rail and used the available power in the country
 isi tarah railway ko electricity act ke antargat Open access kii suvidha di gai
 For this reason, the Railways are also saving on the electricity being purchased by the Railways
 pehle bijli vitaran companiyaan iskaa virodh karti thim jisase railway ko unase majabuuran mahange daam par bijli kharidni padati thi
 Now railways can buy electricity at low prices
 pehle Power Plants or coal kii lincage is tareeke se thi ki agar plant uttar main he to koyala madhya bharat se aayega or uttar yaa purv bharat se koyala pashchim bharat main jayega
 For this reason, power plants had to spend more money on coal transportation and electricity was expensive
 hamane kol linkage kaa keshnalineeshan kiya jisase transportesan kharch or samay donon main kami ai or bijli sasti hui
 Both these examples show that this government is working keeping in mind Total Vision, not Tunnel Vision
 jaise railway trek ke neeche se sadak le jane ke liye Rail Over Bridge banane ke liye maheenon tak railway se hi permission nahin milti thi
 For months, there was a lot of discussion on what the design of Rail Over Bridge should be
 ab is sarkaar main Rail Over Bridge ke liye Uniform Design banaai gai he or proposal is dizin ke aadhaar par hota he to turant NOC de di jaati he
 Power availability is the capital of the country's economic development
 jab se hamaari sarkaar ai he, ham power sector par holistikali kaam kar rahe hai or safal bhi ho rahe hai
 Generation capacity of 46 thousand MW has been added
 janarashan kapacity kareeb 25 pratishat badi he
 Our priority has been to conduct coal transporter auction and to make coal available to power plants
 aaj aisa koi thermal plant nahin he, jo koyale kii uplabdhta kii drushti se critical ho
 Critical means that the availability of coal is less than 7 days
 ek samay badi-badi braking news chalati thi ki desh main bijli sankat gaharaa gaya he- power plant ke paas koyala khatm ho rahaa he
 When was this last breaking news? You won't remember ye braking news ab aapke archive main padi hogi
 Friends, in the first two years of the government, 50,000 circuit kilometer transmission lines were built, while in 2013-14, 16 thousand circuit kilometers transmission lines were built
 sarkari bijli distribution companiyon ko hamaari udai skim dwaara ek nayaa jivan mila he
 All these works have increased the availability of electricity and also reduced the price
 aaj ek App (vidyut pravaah) ke madhyam se dekha ja saktaa he ki kitni bijli, kitni keemat par uplabdh he
 The government is also emphasizing on Clean Energy
 lakshya 175 gigawatt renewable energy ke utpaadan kaa he jisamen se ab tak 50 gigawatt yani pachaas hajaar megawatt kshamta hasil kar lee gai he
 India has reached number four in the world in terms of Global wind power Installed capacity
 sarkaar kaa jor bijli utpaadan badhaane ke saath hi bijli kii khapat kam karne par bhi he
 So far, about 220 million LED bulbs have been distributed in the country

 Expressing concern over high inflation in this detailed report tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, it has been said in the end of this financial year (ending March 2011) that it may remain one and a half percent above normal
 ullekhneey he ki guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhi sansad main kaha tha ki march ant tak mudrasphiti 7 pratishat rahegi, jabaki vittvarsh ke shuru main iske 5
 It was estimated to be up to 5 percent
 aarthik samiksha main kaha gaya he, vaishvik str par upabhokta vastuon ke oonche daam se gharelu bazaar main keemton par dabaav bana rahegaa
 Apart from this, many developed countries are engaged in increasing the availability of cash to infuse the economy
 iskaa asar bhi gharelu arthvyavastha main mahangaai badhane ke rup main saamne aa saktaa he
 The review noted that the International Monetary Fund has also pointed out in its latest report that inflation related to consumer prices will continue to be high in the emerging and developing nations of the world
 imef ne kaha he ki vikasshil deshon main aapurti kii kami or maang kaa jor bana rahane se bazaar par dabaav bana rahegaa

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ko lekarcongressdhyaksharahul gandhike vichaar kisi se chhipe nahin he
 Whether there is a stage in the country or the foreign land, Rahul did not leave any chance to criticize the Sangh
 ab vahi sangh congress adhyaksh ko apane kaarykram main bulaane ja rahaa he
 In fact, from 17 September to 19 September, the Sangh is going to invite many leaders of the opposition including Congress President Rahul Gandhi and CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury in a program called 'future of India: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghka Varshika' in the national capital Delhi
 jise lekar congress samet vipakshi dalon main sugabugahat tej ho gai he
 However, RSS propaganda head Arun Kumar says that this invitation will be sent not to any individual, but to every opposition party, including the Congress and if Rahul Gandhi comes, the Sangh has no objection
 bataa den ki sansad main avishvaas prastaav par bahes ke dauraan rahul gandhi kaa kahana tha ki sangh or bijepi unase kitni bhi nafrat kar le, lekin unke dil main unke prati jaraa si bhi nafrat nahin
 And saying this, Rahul hugged PM Modi
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki sansad ke patal apane die bayaan par rahul kitna kaayam rah pate hai
 For now, the Sangh has put the ball in the court of its most vocal critic Rahul Gandhi
 ullekhneey he ki purv raashtrapatipranab mukherjeeke sangh ke tritiy varsh kaarykram main shaamil hone ko lekar purv grahamantri pi chidambaram or purv kendriya mantri jairam ramesh samet congress ke bade netaaon ne aapatti darj karai thi
 But no one from Rahul Gandhi or Gandhi family commented on Pranab
 gauratlab he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne landan main ek kaarykram main aresas kii tulana muslim brotherhud se kii thi, jisase unki kaaphi aalochana hui
 Sangh's publicity chief Arun Kumar said on Rahul's statement that he who does not understand India cannot understand the Sangh
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi dwaara rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ko rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke liye doshi tehraane vaale bayaan ko lekar maharashtra ke bhiwandi main manahani kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi, despite the court's advice, decided to uphold his statement and said that he was ready to face the court's action
 baharhaal ashishnutaa, gandhi kii hatya, sangh main mahilaon kii bhagidaari ko lekar aresas par lagaataar nishaanaa saadhane vaale rahul, sangh ke nimantran se doraahe par khadey najar aa rahe hai
 If they do not attend this program, they may be stigmatized for being intolerant and withdrawing from their own position in Parliament
 vahiin yadi ve sangh ke kaarykram main shaamil hote hai tab ise aresas ko manyata dene jaisaa prachaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen whether Rahul Gandhi takes the risk of joining the Sangh program like former President Pranab Mukherjee

 Mayawati said at a press conference held at the party office here on Sunday that the BSP would hold conferences and rallies in the name of Sarvajam Samaj Bhaichara to create brotherhood and social harmony in the society across the country

 He said that all the conferences held in the name of the BSP have been done so far, not to divide them on the basis of caste, but to connect the people of the caste-divided society on the basis of mutual brotherhood for centuries
 went
 basapa pramukh ne kaha ki adaalat ne sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko jaateey aadhaar par sammelan na karne kii baat kahi he to duusari taraf samvidhan ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi hamaari party kaa adaalat se ye bhi kahana he ki hamaare desh main kisi khaas dharm ko mahatv dene ke uddeshy se vishwa hindu parishad, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh(aresas) or bajrang dal jaise anek sanghathan bane hue hai jo lagbhag har chunaav main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii disha or chunavi ranneeti tay karte hai
 The court should ban such organizations
 kyonki samvidhan dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneeti karne kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 Taking a dig at Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Mayawati said that she should study the Indian constitution seriously, because the constitution of our country is not based on Hindutva but on the basis of secularism as a whole
 isliye modi ko raajnneetik manch par apane aapako hindu rashtravaadi bataate hue, bhartiya samvidhan kii garima kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 On the Supreme Court's decision on tainted leaders, Mayawati said that the decision of the Supreme Court not to allow even the detained person to contest the elections would benefit less political abuse
 unhone kaha ki hamaari party centre sarkaar se is faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar karne kaa anurodh karti he
 The comments mayawati ne bodhgaya main hue aatanki hamale kii ninda karne ke saath hi desh kii suraksha ke maamle main centre sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya he
 She will go to Bodh Gaya on Monday

 He said that the party will not abandon its social change campaign so that people of the society can truly move forward in accordance with the intent of the Constitution
 unhone kaha ki basapa kii taraf se abhi tak jis bhi samaaj ke naam par sammelan kiye gaye unhen jaateey aadhaar par samaaj main aapas baantne ke liye nahin balki sadiyon se jaateey aadhaar par bante hue samaaj ke logon ko aapasi bhaaichaare ke aadhaar par jodne ke liye kiye gaye
 The BSP chief said that the court has told all political parties not to hold a conference on the basis of caste, on the other hand, keeping the constitution in mind, our party also has to tell the court that in order to give importance to a particular religion in our country With the aim that there are many organizations like Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bajrang Dal, which in almost every election the direction of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and choose v strategy set
 adaalat ko aise sanghathanon par roak lagaani chahie
 Because the Constitution does not allow to do politics on the basis of religion
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue mayawati ne kaha ki vah bhartiya samvidhan kaa gambheertha se dhyanpurvak adhyayan jarur karen, kyonki hamaare desh kaa samvidhan hindutv ke aadhaar par nahin balki puure taur se dharm-nirpekshata ke aadhaar par hi nirmit he
 Therefore, while describing Modi as a Hindu nationalist on the political stage, the dignity of the Indian Constitution should also be taken care of
 daagi netaaon ko lekar ucchtam nyaayalay ke aae faisle par mayawati ne kaha ki hiraasat main liye gaye vyakti tak ko chunaav nahin ladane dene ke sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle kaa phayda kam raajnneetik durupyog zyada hoga
 He said that our party requested the central government to file an appeal against this decision

 Tejashwi Yadav's JDU-RJD continues to gain momentum
 donon partiyon kii khinchataan ke bichatejasvi yadav manjhdhaar main khadey najar aa rahe hai
 While JDU has made up its mind to drop him out of the cabinet, RJD does not want Tejashwi's fairwell at any cost
 is sabake ke bich sawaal ye aa khadaa he ki bihar sarkaar kii naiyya aakhir kab tak doobane se bachegi
 Or will the government of Nitish Kumar's grand alliance continue to run despite Tejashwi's resignation? Now the hour of Nitish's decision is also close
 mangalvaar ko jediu netaaon kii meeting ke baad lalu yadav ko tejasvi par karrwai ke liye 4 din kaa vakt diya gaya tha
 This period will end on Saturday
 magar isse pehle hi argedy ne apana stand bilkul saaf kar diya he
 RJD has repeatedly said that there is no question of Tejashwi's resignation
 guruuvar ko isse aage badhkarargedy vidhayakane nitish kumaar ko apane paas 80 vidhayak hone kii baat kehete hue khud kii majbootee kaa ehsaas kara diya
 That is, the Janata Dal u and RJD stand on their respective positions
 aise main ab faisla mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko karnaa he
 It is also well known that Nitish Kumar cannot compromise on the issue of corruption
 argedy sutron kaa kahana he agar tejasvi kaa istipha bhi hota he to wo khud ko shahid kii tarah pesh kar sakate hai
 This is the strategy of RJD, while RJD strategists are also assuming that Nitish Kumar cannot postpone the action for a long time
 aise main wo apane vikalp ke bare main bhi ranneeti bana rahe hai
 According to the strategy, if Tejashwi Yadav is dismissed, all the ministers of RJD can also resign
 magar, aisa karne ke baavjood bhi argedy nitish sarkaar se samarthan waapas nahin legi
 RJDRJD sources will continue to support that RJD Janata Dal will continue to support the United Government so that it does not go with the BJP again
 duusari taraf argedy ye bhi nahin chaahati ki is najuk maukey par wo sarkaar se baahar ho
 Because the family of Lalu Prasad Yadav is implicated in the case of CBI and ED
 aise main bagaiyr sarkaar ke rahanaa unhen kamjor kar saktaa he
 However, the RJD may also consider the option of forming a government with some independents with the Congress or the Yadav mlas in the JDU
 aise main nitish kumaar ko bhi sochna hoga ki wo kidar jaayen or kis par bharosa karen
 However, the BJP has already indicated its support from outside
 vaise hi ab argedy bhi baahar se samarthan dene kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the chair of Nitish Kumar can avoid being moved even without returning home

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel dwaara unhen ‘sultan’ kahe jane ke ek din baad ravivaar ko palatwaar karte hue kaha ki 'rajvansh he jo sultan paidaa karata he
 Ahmed Patel, political secretary of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, while addressing a rally in Jambusar, said, "modi wants to rule in Gujarat like a sultan of six crore people
" logon ko is sultan ko rokna hoga
 "modi retaliated on this attack," he (patel) called Modi the Sultan, but it is the dynasty that produces the Sultan and you spent your whole life in New Delhi serving these Sultans
 is tarah aap kisi duusare shabd ke bare main soch bhi nahin sakate
 Modi said, "we are here for the support of the people and Ahmed Mian, if you have understanding of democracy then the word Sultan would not have spoken
 ’ is bich, ravivaar ko surat main chunaav prachaar kar rahe patel ne modi ke khilaaf apana abhiyaan jari rakhte hue kaha ki vah (modi) gujarat main sarvaadhik bhrasht vyakti hai
 Patel said that Modi is saying that there is no corruption in the Gujarat government
 lekin yah sabit ho gaya he ki vah gujarat main sabase bhrasht vyakti hai

 Truthfully, i did not understand the electoral significance of the two Guptas till a BJP leader dmed me saying it is a 'masterstroke by AK
 ' BJP urban voted are ulikely to go to Congress but they may very well go to AAP
 Clever
 Have just looked at professional resume of both CA ND Gupta & Dr Sushil Gupta (LLB)
 AAP has pulled off an innovative strategy in RS nominations as well - deep expertise in Edu, Health and economic affairs makes AAP stronger
 Also congratulations to @sanjayazadsln - Arvind Jha (@jalajboy) January 3, 2018 Also congratulations to @sanjayazadsln The impact of the crushing defeat of the Congress and SP alliance at the hands of the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh elections is now visible at the ground level
 upi ke baliya ke ek sthaneey netaa ne lakhanu offis ke baahar poster lagavaaye hai, jin par likhaa he ki prashanth kishor ko dhund kar jo bhi kaaryakarta sammelan main laaegaa, use paanch lakh rupee diye jaaegein
 Raj Babbar removed the posters, although the Congress state president Raj Babbar has given the order to remove it, he said that it would be a very quick step to hold anyone responsible for the defeat
 rajbabbar lakhanu main haar kii samiksha baithak karne ke liye aaen hai
 According to the news published in 'indian Express' fooling PK, this poster has been put up by Secretary of State Congress Committee, Rajesh Singh, he says that he has got this poster on behalf of all Congressmen
 unhone kaha ki hamen pichley ek varshe se bevakoof banaaya ja rahaa tha, hamanen unke har aadesh kaa bina koi sawaal puche paalan kiya
 But now we need the answer to this defeat
 unhone kaha ki poster bhale hi hat jaae, lekin yah sawaal to sabhi varkar ke dilon main he

 namaskara main raveesh kumaar, 624 logon kii maut ho gai he or 9311 maamle darj ho chuke hai
 Swine flu is being reported from the districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra and even from the districts
 mangalvaar ko kendriya swasthya mantri ne ek ucch stareey baithak bhi bulaai, lekin isse pehle ki sarkari system harakat main aae itane logon kii maut logon ke bekhbar rahane se hui yaa system ne unhen samay par raahat nahin di
 When will it be calculated and who will do it
 2009 main swine flu se 3000 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 On February 15, 11 people died in Rajasthan
 yahaan teen hazaar ke kareeb logon ko swine flu ho chukaa he
 The National Law University of Jodhpur has been closed till March 2 because a student got swine flu
 pichley 24 ghante main madhyapradesh or gujarat main aath-aath log is beemaari se mare hai
 Four doctors of Bhopal's JP Hospital and Private Astpal have swine flu
 dilli main bhi doctor isaki chapet main aae hai, magar dilli or tamilnadu main bhi swine flu failata ja rahaa he
 However, the death toll in these two states is small
 shaayad isliye ki log is beemaari ke lakshan or upachaar ko lekar jaagruk hai
 This means that if we make the general public aware of this, then the lives of many people can be saved
 dilli main 1500 logon ko swine flu hua he lekin sirf saat logon kii maut hui he
 We cannot reduce the tragedy of someone's death by counting, but timely treatment can save lives
 is beemaari se yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki hamaare aspataalon kii haalat kisi he
 The truth is also coming out about the availability of doctors and medicines, and especially the number of icus
 rajasthan or gujarat main centre se team bheji gai he
 That is, even in five years, we have not been able to make complete arrangements to deal with swine flu at the state level
 aapako yaheen bataa den ki iske liye ek dawa aati he jiskaa naam he Oseltamivir, temi flu
 The government claims that this drug is available everywhere and there is no shortage of it
 isi ke saath aapane tivi screen par swine flu marizon ke saath aajaa rahe logon ko nakaab lagaae dekh rahe hai
 Some people have put the normal mask, which comes to four rupees
 isse kuch khaas laabh nahin hota he
 You should know that there is a special mask called N-95 for this
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne aaj yah mask lagaakar bataaya ki en 95 mask vishwa swasthya sanghathan se pramanit he
 It consists of three layers
 duusare mask main is tarah kii paraten nahin hoti hai jisase aapkaa sahi tareeke se bachaav nahin ho saktaa he
 So you have to be especially careful about this mask
 90 rupaya bahut hota he par phir bhi
 People told ndtv's Rajasthan correspondent Harsha that this mask is not getting in sufficient numbers
 yahaan tak ki sarkari dukaan main bhi mask nahin mil rahaa tha
 In Rajasthan, 6 percent of the people who have had swine flu have died
 doctoron ne bataaya ki gaanvon main log der se is beemaari ko lekar satark ho rahe hai or jaipur aate-aate bahut der ho ja rahi he
 Like 70-year-old Ram Prasad Saini had fever and cold for four days, but came to Jaipur when shortness of breath started
 jaipur main doctoron ne harsha kumari singh ko bataaya ki pichley 2 maheene main jitani bhi maut hui hai unamem se do tihaai bharti hone ke 48 ghante ke bheetar hui he yani sthiti kharaab hone par ve astpal aae hai
 You can guess how bad the condition of hospitals in villages is because people will have to flee to Jaipur in the event of death due to lack of basic examination
 savai maansingh rajasthan kaa ek bada astpal he lekin yahaan swine flu se nipatane main madad ke liye safadarajang aspataal se teen sadasyon kii team bheji gai he
 We will also talk about the symptoms of disease and methods of prevention in prime time, but whether we have swine flu or not, many people can be killed in this investigation
 sarkari aspataalon main muft jaanch kii suvidha he to privet lab main aapako paanch hazaar se nau hajaar tak lag saktaa he
 It is not yet clear whether people are getting more tests done in government labs or in private labs
 aaj ke times of india main ek report chhapi he ki saamaanya bukhaar, gale main karaash or khaansee main log swil flu ke test karvaa rahe hai
 Whereas high fever, body ache and runny nose were tested for swine flu
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki ho saktaa he ki kaiyon ko tej bukaar na ho magar swine flu ho
 Diarrhea has also been added to the symptoms of swine flu
 is baar log pehle hi test kara lenaa chaahate hai kyonki ve jokhim nahin uthaanaa chaahate
 Test is free in government hospitals
 lekin sarkaar dwaara manyata praapt privet lab kaaphi mahange hai
 The condition is that samples are coming from all over the country in Delhi's private lab
 laal peth lab or quest main 5000 rupee main test ho rahaa he to daing or lifline lab main 9000 rupee main
 The test is being conducted at SRL Religare for Rs 7230
 ye itnaa mahangaa kyon he or rate main antar kyon he is par bhi baat karenge prime time main
 Today, we will talk about this disease as well as try to understand how our government system takes steps in this kind of pandemic situation regarding public health, is it enough, is it those standards But it can live up to the life of a normal man
 tamaam dishanirdeshon ke baavjood aisi sthiti main kisi ko aspataal main daakhila milanaa aasaan hota he kya

 The agency has said, "money received from students is nothing but income earned from (money laundering) crime
" is dhan ko in chaaron ne or anya ne aapas main baanta
 The investigation has directly revealed that Sagar and Bhandari illegally obtained funds by resorting to malpractices in PMT-2012, pre-pg Exam-2012, PMT-2013 and deposited this money illegally earned in banks
 And bought many properties

 i had created one such image about my Hindi teacher Sudesh Pachauri
 yah baat us samay kii he jab maine 2004 main jakir hossain college main grajuation main daakhil liya tha
 i got admission in sports honors from sports quota, so i think reading Hindi is also a game of Gilli Poles
 isi soch main jite hue mainsports practicekarta or kabhi bhi hindi kii class main nahin jaataa tha
 Even if i got time, i used to sit in the canteen playing Dosti Yari
 ek din canteen main mere hindi teacher sudesh pachori pahunch gaye or unhone mujhase poocha 'shriman aap hindi onors ke student hai ?' meraa jawaab haa tha
 The second question also arose, 'how many classes have you attended so far? On this i said very easily that i have come from sports quota, so much of my time is spent in the playground and after that it is difficult to attend class
 ye sunakar ve chupchaap chale gaye lekin duusare din unhone hindi kaa test lene kii baat kahi jo sabko dena tha
 i had received the news and i reached without any fear because till now i had opened the door for admission from sports quota
 aakhirkaar test hua or nateezon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 Everyone was near me in the whole class
 sahi vaakya main kahuun to main akelaa student tha jo fail hua tha
 Still i did not mind because it is not necessary to read sports person
 i was living in this happiness
 time beetaa or final exam kaa vakt kareeb aane laga
 Befry inside me was still intact
 ek din mere teacher ne mujhe phir bulaayaa or bolaa ki tumhaari atendence to class main he nahin, is lihaaj main tum exam main nahin baith sakate ho
 Both my wisdom and my strut were not reduced
 to maine bol diya ki sports cote waalon ko atendence se kya fark
 They will be found easily
 iske baad main sports ke teacher se mila lekin unhone yah kehete hue apane haath khadey kar die ki 40 fisadi hajiri to main dikhaa saktaa hum lekin 20 fisadi ke liye tumhen hindi class main janaa hoga
 Eventually, i reached my Hindi class
 pehla din or aaj to sudesh ji bhi puri taiyaari se the
 My style was classy and it lasted for two days
 iske baad maine teacher se baat karne kii sochi, sach kahuun to yahaan bhi main yahi sochakar milane gaya tha ki baatcheet se koi rasta nikaal luungaa
 But what happened there was beyond my thinking
 sudesh ji mujhase bahut saral tareeke se mili
 i spoke about Hindi
 tab unhone kaha ki tumhaari pareshaani yah he ki tum hindi ko bahut hi aasaan samajhate ho, jabaki aisa nahin he
 Learn to respect the language
 kaaphi der main unke paas baitha rahaa unhone mujhe apane bare main bataaya aurahindike bare main bhi
 After that there was a change in me
 main rojaanaa class main jaataa or final exam main test main fail hone vaale student ne bhi 50 fisadi number paa liye
 i told him this, which he was more proud of
 aaj is baat ko kai saal biit gaye lekin unhone hindi ko lekar dil main izzat din par din badhati gai
 Not only this, my attitude also changed that the identity of a person is not his dress, in fact he thinks

 The party's top leadership is understood to be in a mood to take stern action in the matter
 aise main agar vasundhara ke jawaab se vah santusht nahin hota he to karrwai, yahaan tak kii istife kii maang bhi kii ja sakati he
 However, it is quite possible that influential leaders like Rajnath and Gadkari would curb the demand for resignation, but it is certain that in any case the party will take some action on Vasundhara
 oonchi-oonchi hells pahanakar catwalk karne vaali modells kai baar ramp par gir jaati hai, lekin jab ek fishan sho main ek nahin balki teen-teen modells catwalk karte hue gir jaaen to baat badi ho jaati he
 Yes, something similar happened on Sunday at the Fashion Week of China on the show of Sacri Hu Sheguang
 is sho main modells saat se aath inch kii hells pahanakar ramp walk kar rahi thim
 Then three different models fell one after the other
 vahaan maujuud photographeron ne us puure vaake ko apane camere main kaid kar liya
 First, a model wearing a scarlet leather body suit fell victim to an accident
 model ne laal rang kii maiching placeform hells pahani huin thi
 She was walking the ramp with a red shawl in her hand, which later led to her fall
 shawl uske pairon ke neeche aa gaya tha
 At first the model was surprised and bowed to one side
 lekin iske baad vah puri tarah se phisalkar jameen par baith gai
 The second model wore a red wig and a long red dress
 vah bhi apni ajeeb si hells kii vajah se phisalkar ramp par gir gai
 He had closed his eyes and then collapsed on his knees
 tasviir dekhakar saaf he ki use dard ho rahaa tha or vah kaaphi sharminda bhi thi
 The third model that came after it was very careful walking the ramp so that no mistakes were made, but the pencil heels she wore betrayed her

 Although she handled herself, she once again fell on the ramp
 teen-teen modells ke is tarah girane ke baavjood baaki ke sho main koi gadabadi nahin hui
 The models were so embarrassed that they fell like this in front of many people, but this is not the first time

 People remember the incident that happened with supermodel Naomi Campbell at a Paris fashion show in 1993

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections in Chhattisgarh, the government's decree to stop the supply of food grains to the 'annapurna dal-bhat Center' has intensified
 kendriya upabhokta maamle, khaadya or saarvajanik vitaran mantralay ne 19 march ko rajya sarkaar ko patr bhejkar kaha ki 1 april se ashram / chatravaas or kalyankari yojana ke tahat ab anaaj sirf unheen sansthaaon ko milegaa, jinhen sarkari santhaan chalaa rahe hai
 As such, its first gazes fell on 128 'annapurna dal-bhat Centers' running in the state since 2004, run by self-help groups or non-government organizations

 darasal, bharat sarkaar rajya sarkaar ko ashram / chatravaas evam kalyanakari yojana ke tahat rajya ko anaaj muhaiyaa karwaati thi
 The state government was providing 13 Ann kg of rice every month to the Center at a subsidized rate (rs 2 per kg) of rice from the grain received from the Center
 aam chunaav se ain pehle is yojana ko band karne ke faisle ko siyaasi sajeesh ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Right now, former Chief Minister and BJP leader Raman Singh and Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel are targeting each other on this issue
 mukhyamantri baghel ne twit kar kaha, ''2014 main narendra modi ne pradhanmantri banate hi pehle kisaanon kaa bonus roka or phir ab daal-bhaat kendron ke liye chaaval dene se manaa kar diya
 Chhattisgarhiya is definitely innocent, but not weak
 chhattisgarh virodh kii maansikta vaale narendra modi or unki party kii pradesh kii janata eent se eent baja degi
 "on the other hand, on these allegations, Raman Singh said," dal-bhat centers were started for the poor
 inhen band karke sarkaar ne sabit kar diya ki unka aarthik prabandhan kitna kamjor he
 The central government has refused to give only rice
 kya rajya sarkaar chaaval kaa intjaam nahin kar sakati? yah pradesh kii badahaal aarthik sthiti ko darshata he
 The situation of a government drowning in debt from head to toe is a matter of thinking what happens after the Lok Sabha elections
 " jaahir he, in kendron ke band hone kaa thikra rajya main congress or bhaajapa ek-duusare par phod rahi hai
 At the same time, Devki, who runs the Annapurna daal-bhat center outside the SDM office of Gariaband district of the state, says, "if you want to shut down, stop drinking, ban the plate of the poor, where is the justice?" Says Urmila, who runs the Bhat Center, "with the cheap thali available here, women running the centers also get Rs 25,00-3000 per month
 mil jate the
 Apparently sensing the dissatisfaction among the people who run the centers, Baghel wrote a letter to Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on April 3, requesting him not to stop the help of food grains
 mukhyamantri ne patr main likhaa he ki anaaj band karne kii vajah se rajya sarkaar se anudaan or manyata praapt 471 sansthaaon ko centre se milane vaale 655 ton chaaval kii aapurti bhi band ho gai he, jiskaa asar 43,640 logon par padegaa
 These include students belonging to scheduled castes, tribes, backward classes and people from other disadvantaged sections
 raipur ke samajasevi vikrant sharma kehete hai, ''donon party ke netaaon kii chintaa in daal-bhaat kendron ke band hone kii nahin he, balki isaki he ki is mudde par koun, kise kitna gher paaegaa

" kuch na kuch kadam uthaae jaaenge taaki rajya kii garib janata saste bhojan se vanchit na rahe
 "so, will the Congress government of the state introduce the plate of the poor with a new name on the lines of 'universal Health Scheme'?" Singhdev says, "he will do something

 The Modi government is scheduled to introduce the much-discussed GST bill in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday amid uproar in the monsoon session
 iske maddenjar mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne bhi apane saansadon ko vip jari kar sadan main upasthit rahane ke liye kaha he
 Whereas the controversial Land Acquisition Bill will now be brought in the Winter Session of Parliament after the Bihar Assembly elections
 bhoomi bill ke kuch ahm praavdhaanon ko lekar vipaksh apane rukh par kaayam he, vahiin satta paksh vidheyak kaa adhyayan kar rahi sanyukt samiti main matvibhaajan se bachanaa chahta he
 The decision to extend the tenure of the committee till the winter session of Parliament was taken after a bitter war between the BJP and Congress members in the committee
 congress ne 1894 ke adhinium ke tahat adhigrahitbhoomi ke muaavjesambandhi maamalon ko nipataane main vidheyak ke purvaprabhavi upbandh main kisi bhi prakaar ke badlaav kaa virodh kiya
 In place of this 1894 Act, a new Bill was passed in 2013 during the tenure of the UPA Government
 matvibhaajan kii mancongress, trinmul congress or bijedy ke sadasyon ne matvibhaajan kii maang kii to samiti ke adhyaksh es es ahaluwalia ne kaha ki samiti sarvasammati se ek report degi or kuch upbandhon kaa baariki se adhyayan karne ke liye or samay maangane kii congress or trinmul congress ke sadasyon kii maang ko sweekaar kar liya
 The committee was given time to report by August 11 in the earlier extension
 congress or trinmul congress sadasyon kii or samay kii maang ke baad ahaluwalia ne loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan se samiti ko ek or samay vistaar dene kii apil karne kaa faisla kiya kyonki vah sarvasammat report saunpna chaahate hai
 BJP has 11 members in the committee, while its allies LJP, TDP and Shiv Sena have one member each
 vipaksh main congress ke paanch sadsy hai to trinmul congress ke do, bijedy, sipiem, jediu, tiares, ensipi, espi or bispi ke ek-ek sadsy hai
 The proposal to ask for time till the last day of the first week of the winter session is listed on Tuesday's agenda of the colloquium
 sheetakaaleen satr saamaanya taur par november ke tisare saptaah main shuru hota he or disambar ke tisare saptaah main samaapt hota he
 This would mean that the bill will come to Parliament only after the assembly elections in Bihar are over, where the BJP is hoping to wipe out the Nitish Kumar government
 moonga sukh samruddhi kaa pratik hota he
 Similarly, wearing coral garland gives the grace of Ganapati ji, Lord Shree Rama and Hanuman ji
 muunge kii maala pahanane se sukh samruddhi badhati he, dhan aata he
 This relieves sickness
 roga se ladane kii kshamta milti he or nakaaratmak yaa ashubh shaktiyaan pareshaan nahin karti hai
 Chanting can also be done with a rosary of coral
 aaie jaanate hai muunge kii maala pahanane kaa kya he mahatv
 Who can wear the rosary of coral - If the memory is weak, the children are weak in studies, the children do not believe, the Mercury planet in the horoscope is weak, the planet of knowledge is weak, then the garland of coral should be worn
 muunge maala pahanane se mangal balavaan hote hai
 But before wearing the garland, make sure to worship this garland in the Hanuman temple
 muunge kii maala aatmavishvaas ko badhaati he-- muunge kii maala se hanuman ji or shri ram ke mantron kaa jaap kar sakate hai
 - If a Suhagin woman is wearing a coral garland, then her husband's health is good
 - unka har sankat dur hota he or bhagwaan hanuman ji hardam puure parivaar kii raksha karte hai
 When to wear coral garland - Basil garland is made from coral wood in red thread
 - ise mangalvaar ko dhaaran karnaa chahie
 - Before wearing Hanuman ji, Shiva ji and Shree Rama ji should be worshiped
 - muunge kii maala pahanane se najar nahin lagati or sabhi prakaar ke sukh kii prapti hoti he
 - Wash it with Ganges water, wear it with incense lamps
 - muunge kii maala pahanakar maas-madiraa kaa seven nahin kar sakate hai or naa hi jhooth bol sakate hai

 The sixties in India were also the first disillusionment after independence
 azaadi ke daur main dekhe gaye sapane thakne se lage the
 The generation that fought for the freedom was dead and its earners were emerging everywhere, amidst the frustration of the post-china war and the void created by Nehru's demise, Indian politics went through the challenge of redefining and reinterpreting itself

 George Fernandes was one of the few glowing faces in this renewed struggle in India who believed in the future

 lekin ve haare or jorge kisi sansani kii tarah saamne aae
 In the seventies this sensation revealed that they are long-lived volcanoes
 immergency se pehle 15 lakh relkarmiyon ko lekar unhone jis tarah hadtaal kii thi, use majdoor andolan ke itihaas main kisi myth katha kii tarah yaad rakhaa jaataa he
 Similarly, the way he won the Muzaffarpur seat while in jail during the Emergency is also one of the repeated stories of politics
 us daur ke netaaon main atal ke alaava ve duusare the jinaki vaktruta style kii alag se charchaa hoti thi
 They were called 'bandit storms'
 jorge ke bare me do-teen baaten behad spasht thim
 He knew to fight and to fight
 garibon, mazdooron or aam logon se judane main unhen samay nahin lagata tha
 He was a kind of passionate proletariat
 ve ummid jagaate the
 His courage went to the extent of adventure
 baroda dynamite cese unke isi dussahas kii misaal kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 He considered Indira Gandhi's government as a fascist government and could think of using dynamite to remove it
 1977 main jab janata party kii sarkaar bani to jorge udyog mantri banaae gaye
 Among the important decisions he made, a large company like coca-cola was also to flee India
 yah alag baat he ki kareeb do dashak baad cocacola unke jite-ji laut aayaa
 Later Railway Minister, Defense Minister became everything
 lekin jorge kii puri raajnneeti bataati he ki kaise bhartiya loktantr main sambhaavnaaon ke bade-bade agnibij samjhauton ke thande padate purjon main badalte chale gaye
 The study of this politics can be interesting to understand how Indian socialism went out to fight against the dangers of fascism and communalism
 darasal in dinon jo log samyawad or samaajwaad ko bilkul ek raajnneetik line main rakhte hai, ve shaayad nahin jaanate ki ek daur main bhartiya samaajawaadee congress or bhartiya vamapanthiyon se is tarah chidhate the ki unhen jansangh ke qareeb aane main bhi gurej nahin hota tha
 Lohia used to say that both capitalism and communism are the last European weapons of attack on India
 majdoor andolan se jude jorge china ko bharat ke liye bada khatara maanate the or sambhawatah indira gandhi or congress ke loktantravirohi vyaktivaadee rujhaan se buree tarah naaraaz kisi se bhi haath milaane ko taiyaar the
 The coming together of george-madhu Limaye and atal-advani in the first Janata Party government of 1977 was a form of irony whose dangers were not recognized by anyone then
 sach to yah he ki jorge kii raajnneetik kalabaziyaan isi daur se shuru hoti hai
 When the Janata Party broke up in 1979, George was brought up in 24 hours
 ek din pehle morarji kii sarkaar ke paksh main zordaar daleelein deen or agle din duusare paale main nazar aae
 Of course, it was the haste to assess more immediate political pressures than compromise, which led to George's decision
 aane vaale dinon main aise faisale or zyada dikhne lage
 Especially in the 90s, he first formed the Samata Party against Lalu Yadav's corruption and familyism and then joined hands with the BJP
 yahaan aakar achaanak jorge badale-badale dikhte hai
 He looks like a fire extinguished between which he had a smoldering personality
 ve vaajapeyi sarkaar ke raksha mantri bhi banate hai or sankatmochan bhi
 Suddenly we find that they remain unaffected by the incident of Father George Stein and his children being burnt alive in Odisha
 ve centre kii ore se jaakar jaanch karte hai or sabko clin chit dekar laut aate hai
 Was it possible with old George? Had he been, he would have thought of setting fire
 jis ashishnutaa kii charchaa aaj ho rahi he, vah unheen dinon shuru ho gai thi jab centre main pehali endie sarkaar us pradhanmantri ke netritv main bani thi jise sab udaar maanate the
 But he was a mask, no one else had said this, by Govindacharya, who used to be prominent in the policy makers of BJP and Sangh Parivar in those days
 kehane kii zarurat nahi ki vah mukhauta aaj hat bhar gaya he
 Nonetheless, some of George's statements during Kargil were surprising
 baad main tahalaka ke sting oparation kii vajah se unako kuch samay ke liye istifa bhi dena padaa
 He returned again, but there was a clash in Parliament over him and he remained neutral
 loktantr ko kamazor karne vaali takaton se ladane or ek samaajawaadee bharat banane kaa sapana dekhne vaala ek netaa ek din achaanak phir duusare sire par jaakar unheen takaton kaa saathi ho jaataa he jo loktantr ko kamazor kar rahi hai- yah baat chaahe jitani udhaas karne vaali ho, lekin jorge kii raajnneeti ke nijee paraabhav kii tarah ise padhanaa un bahut saare sawaalon ko alakshith kar dena hoga jisaki vajah se yah sthiti paidaa hui ki bahut saare log is kheme se us kheme main chale gaye
 This is the tragedy that is making the challenge of protecting democracy in India from the ever-strengthening web of fascism
 Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on # georgefernandes: It is very sad news

 Whether or not Oblivion has any torture is not known, but George had forgotten everything - anything that was really worth forgetting
 lekin hamen yaad rakhana hoga- ve koun si vidambnaaen thim jinaki vajah se hamaare bachapan or kishor dinon kaa ek bada or sambhaavnashil netaa hamase dur hota chalaa gaya

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the allegations of irregularities in the CAG report on allocation of coal blocks are not based on facts and are utterly baseless
 pradhanmantri ne loksabhaa main bayaan dene ke baad sansad bhawan ke baahar media main bhi bayaan diya
 Responding to those who taunted his' silence ', the lion read,' My silence is better than thousands of answers, i don't know how many questions have been kept
 'singh ne sansad ke donon sadanon main kaig report par apni ore se die bayaan main kaha ki main mananeey sadasyon ko aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki report main ullikhit avadhi main se kuch samay ke liye koyala mantralay kaa prabharee mantri hone ke naate main mantralay ke nirnyon kii puri jimmedaari letaa hum
 i want to say that whatever allegations of irregularities have been made are not based on facts and are utterly baseless
 unhone kaig kii report main kii gayi mukhya teen aapattiyon ko bhi ‘spasht rup se vivaadaaspad’ bataaya
 Taking potshots at the main opposition BJP demanding his resignation on the above report, the Prime Minister said that it was proposed to allocate coal blocks with competitive bidding when UPA came to power, but Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand under the then ruling regime of opposition parties , Odisha, Rajasthan, West Bengal etc
 States were strongly opposed to adopting competitive bidding process
 unhone kaha ki rajasthan kii tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne april 2005 main unhen likhe patr main pratispardhi boli kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki yah sarkaria ayog kii siforeeshon kii bhaavana ke vipareet hoga
 Singh said that similarly Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh in a letter sent in June 2005 requested to continue the current policy
 unhone kaha ki isi tarah tatkaaleen vam morcha shasit pashchim bengal or bijd bhaajapa shasit odisha sarkaron ne bhi pratispardhi boli paddati kaa aupchaarik virodh karte hue unhen patr likhe the
 According to Singh, opposition-ruled states said that allocation of coal blocks through competitive bidding would increase the price of coal, which would adversely affect the development of industries in their areas and would also reduce their privileges to select tenants
 pradhanmantri ne kaig ke apane adhikaar kshetra se baahar jane par kadi tippanee karte hue kaha ki kisi bhi sthiti main loktantr main is baat ko sweekaar karnaa kathin he ki niti main badlaav ko lagu karne ke liye sarkaar ke kanoonee sudhaar sambandhi kisi nirnay par lekha pariksha main pratikul tippanee kii jaae
 On the cag's remarks about the delay in the necessary amendments to the Bill for competitive bidding in coal block allocation, he said that the CAG report criticized the government for not implementing this decision expeditiously
 main is baat se purnat: sahamat hum ki yadi aadesh maatr se kaam karnaa sambhav hota to ham yah kaam zyada teji se kar sakate the lekin hamaari sansadeey vyavastha main sarvasammati banane kii jatil prakriya ko dekhte hue aisa karnaa kathin he
 He referred to the objections raised in the CAG report on the allocation for three main reasons and said that the comments of the CAG are clearly controversial
 kaig kii ye teen tippaniyan hai, jaanch samiti ne koyala blaak aavanton ke liye sifarish karte samay paardarshee or nishpaksh paddati nahin apanaayin
 Competitive bidding could be started only in 2006 by amending the existing administrative directives but a lengthy process was adopted which delayed the decision making
 report kii teesri mukhya aapatti he ki pratispardhi boli shuru karne main vilamb ke kaaran maujuuda prakriya se kai nijee companiyon ko lagbhag 1
 There was an economic benefit of 86 lakh crores
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kaig ne jis niti kii aalochana kii he, vah samprag sarkaar se bahut pehle 1993 se chali aa rahi he
 He said that coal blocks were being allocated since 1993 based on the recommendation of an inter-ministerial inquiry committee
 is samiti main rajya sarkaron ke bhi pratinidhi the
 He said that UPA in view of the fast growing demand for coal and captive coal blocks
 sarkaar ne pehali baar june 2004 main pratispardhi boli se aavanton kaa vichaar kiya
 Singh said the cag's statement that the competitive bid could be launched in 2006 by amending the existing administrative directives was flawed
 unhone kaha ki 25 july 2005 ko pradhanmantri karyaalay main ek baithak yojit kii gayi, jisamen koyala evam lignite vaale rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ne bhaag liya tha
 At the meeting, representatives of state governments opposed the proposal to adopt competitive bidding
 bayaan main unhone kaha ki baithak ke baad yah dekha gaya ki prastaavit badlaav ke liye jaruri vidhaayi parivartan ko laane main kaaphi samay lagegaa or captive khanan kii aavanton prakriya ko koyale kii badhati maang ke madadenjar itane lambey samay tak roak kar nahin rakhaa ja saktaa isliye baithak main nirnay liya gaya ki nayi pratispardhi boli prakriya jab tak prachlit nahin ho jaati tab tak maujuuda jaanch samiti prakriya ke madhyam se koyala blaakon ke aavanton ko jari rakhaa jaae or yah centre evam sambandhit rajya sarkaron kaa samuhik nirnay tha

 neend se jaag gaye ghar ke sadasyon ne chor ko pakadaney kii koshish kii to usne ghar kaa darwaja band kar liya
 The thief also tried to escape by breaking the sheet of nectar, but he did not succeed
 aakhirkaar chor ke bhaagane kaa ek hi raast bachaa, darwaja kholkar
 But as soon as the thief tried to escape by opening the door, the people of the house caught him
 chor ko pakadakar ghar ke sadasyon ne uski pitayee shuru kar di
 When the members of the house came to know that the thief works in a nearby company, they left him outside the company in half-hearted condition
 company ke forman ne lekin chor ko company ke andar nahin kiya or get band kar liya
 Later, when people came to know that someone's body was lying outside the company gate, they informed the company's foreman
 phir forman ne isaki soochna police ko di
 Police reached the spot and took the body and sent it to the civil hospital for post mortem
 police kii maane to unhen soochna mili thi kii sarurpur ilaake main ek ghar main chori karne ke liye ghuse chor ko ghar ke sadasyon ne buree taras se peet-peet kar maar daalaa he
 But when the police reached the spot, the dead body was found outside the company, not outside the house
 police ne bataaya ki mritak kaa naam lalit tha, jo bihar ke darbhanga jile kaa rahane vala tha

 Your home loan is usually a loan taken for a long period i
e
 10-20 years
 is dauraan aapke upar lagaataar dabaav bana rahata he ki aap aapane aay ke shroton ko barkaraar rakhen kyonki prati maah aapakon apni kul masik aay se moti rakam nikaal kar bataur EMI bhugtan kerani hoti he
 Despite this, if there is a huge upsurge in the situation and you are not able to pay your EMI, then you really have a big problem
 yah samasya or vikat ho jaati he yadi aapaki berogari avadhi lambii ho jaae
 Generally, in these situations you have no option but to sell that property taken on loan at a loss
 aisi sthiti main aap bank lone ke difolter ban jate hai or credit reating ko nuksaan pahunchataa he
 Therefore, it is your endeavor to manage your financial management in this hour of trouble
 baharhaal, aisi sthiti main aapke liye or bhi kuch vikalp hai jinhen aap apnevitiya salaahkaarase raay lekar aajamaa sakate hai
 Significantly, after defaulting in EMI continuously for three months, the bank declares you a defaulter and starts an action against you
 1
 Emergency Funds and Investments: In such a delicate situation, you should turn to any old investment emergency fund you had
 vittiya salaahkaaron ke mutabik naukrishuda logon ko apni masik selary kaa 6 guna fund bana kar chalanaa chahie
 This fund can handle you in your short term unemployment and till the new job you can pay your EMI through this fund
 2
 Fixed Deposit and Mutual Funds: If for some reason you do not have an emergency fund, you can redeem the investments you make, such as fixed deposits and mutual funds, and create funds to pay emis and monthly household expenses
 3
 Insurance Scheme: Usually, before taking a home loan, people invest in many types of insurance schemes which also have savings
 kai insurance skim bhale aapako kam ritern detii he lekin aap unka istemaal lone lene main kar sakate hai
 So, you can use these schemes taken by you to avoid home loan default
 aamtaur par vittiya sahalakaron kaa maananaa he ki logon ko is tarah kii 3-4 skiimon main nivesh karnaa chahie
 4
 provident fund:jaankaron ke mutabik, yadi aap upar die tareekon ko apnaane main sakasham nahin hai tab aapako apane provident fund kaa rukh karnaa chahie
 People usually hesitate to touch this fund because it is the deposit made for your retirement
 lekin, bank lone main difolt karne se behatar hoga ki jab aapke paas koi vikalp nahin he to aap iskaa istemaal karte hue apane iemai kaa bhugtan karen
 If you have worked for 5 years, then you will not have to pay any tax on withdrawal from this fund, but after getting a new job, you will have to open a new provident fund account
 in sabhi tareekon ko yadi aap nahin apana sakate to is surat main aapakon bank se sidhe baat kerani chahie
 The bank reserves the right to hold your EMI for some period or to give an option of refinancing
 is sthiti main bank aapke iemai bhugtan kii avadhi ko badha saktaa he
 Most financial affairs experts also believe that if you have taken a loan for a property just for investment, then in that case you should close your loan by selling the property taken directly at a cheaper rate

 Can you imagine that the candidates of Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Chinese origin reach the Parliament of India, who are beating themselves to the world's largest and greatest democracy
 bharat ke paas maujuuda samay main sonia gandhi ke alaava aisa koi udhaaharan nahin he
 The manner in which people of Asian descent have won the elections in Britain is a mirror for us Indians
 britain or america kii sansad aise udaahranon se bhari padi hai or ek ham hai ki kisi kii deshbhakti ko janmabhumi ke aadhaar par tay karte rah jate hai, naagarikta dekar use sansthaaon se dur rakhane kaa har sambhav prayaas karte hai
 After all, why do the people of Britain and the institutions there not have the same threat as us? How is the maturity or confidence of the people there more than that they consider the children of people from other countries to be their children and choose representatives
 hamaare yahaan to tarah-tarah ke dal vaale lathi lekar aa jaaenge or bataane lagenge ki ek din inaki aabaadi bad jaaegi, ek din ye sansad or phir desh par khatara ban jaaenge
 These parties should have campaigned in Britain and please do not vote for people of Asian origin
 ye deshbhakti ke liye khatara hai
 In Britain it is even being said that one day our Prime Minister will be of Asian origin
 yah baat daraane ke liye nahin kahi ja rahi he, balki britain gaurav ke us kshan kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 Will India, who cherishes the dream of becoming a world guru and power, ever show such confidence
 aakhir britain kaa koun sa rashtrawaad he, jo apane nagarikon ke janmasthan kaa pataa lagaakar khoff nahin khaataa
 Our democracy is shaken up when it comes to Sonia Gandhi's Prime Minister in India
 naagarik hone ke baad bhi sonia gandhi ke mul ko lekar bahes chalati rahati he ki ve saansad tak to thik hai magar koi videshi pradhanmantri kaise ban saktaa he
 We also do not respect the civil rights given by the Constitution
 saal 2004 main upie kii jeet ke baad sushamaa swaraj ne turant elaan kar diya ki agar sonia gandhi pradhanmantri baniin to apana sar mudwa lengi
 Even in the Lok Sabha elections in 2013, Sushma Swaraj again said that i still stand on the opinion that Sonia Gandhi should not become Prime Minister
 ye or baat he ki turant pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kah diya ki sonia gandhi ke italian mul kaa mudda ab mar chukaa he
 Evidence of whether this issue is dead or not will be found immediately, just to say that Sonia Gandhi will become Prime Minister
 dekh lijiega ki kiske kaise bayaan aate hai
 If we take such pride in winning people of Indian origin in the Parliament of Britain or America, will we be able to give the same pride to people of other origin
 kya koi chini mul kaa vyakti dilli kii kisi seat se chunaav jeet sakegaa
 a party will also dare to give tickets
 koi chunaav aisa nahin guzarataa jisamen bangladeshi nagarikon kaa mudda na uthta ho
 Its sole purpose is to make communal polarization suspicious of Indian Muslims
 britain kii sansad main is baar bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina kii bhatiji tulip siddiq jiti hai
 Alan Mak became the first British MP of Chinese origin
 mak ne kaha he ki unke mul ko lekar zyada utsav manaane kii zarurat nahin hai
 i was born in Britain and this is my country
 zaahir he mulk par adhikaar yaa usase lagaav sirf janmasthan ke kaaran nahin hota hoga
 Such diversity is often seen in the British cricket team itself, which we start celebrating from Punjab to Delhi
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki pakistani mul kii naseem shah ko bhi vahaan kii janata ne apana pratinidhi chunaa he, jinaki maa apane atyaachaari pati kii hatya ke aarope main jail ja chuki hai
 If a candidate of such background comes to India, his parents will make it an issue and the crowd will start to be encouraged that if the criminal becomes the MP of the family, then he will do what a criminal does
 haalanki aparaadhiyon ko saansad banane ke maamle main hamaara ricard duniya ke kisi desh se karaab nahin hona chahie
 Lisa Nandi has become MP from Vigan and Seema Malhotra from South West London
 suela fernadis fareham se or priti patel vitaham se saansad bani hai
 Alok Sharma has become MP from Riding West and Virender Sharma from Ealing Southall
 infosis ke sansthaapak narayan murti ke damaad rishi sunaav bhi saansad chune gaye hai
 Shailesh Vara has been elected by the British public as his MP from Cambridgeshire North West
 in naamon se garv ho rahaa he to yahi gaurav bharat ko bhi duniya ke itihaas ko lautaanaa hoga
 The election of people of origin from the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the United States is telling that the responsibility or eligibility to be an MP or to run democratic institutions is not determined by the origin of one's birthplace
 deshbhakti janmasthan ke aadhaar par paribhaashit nahin hogi balki iskaa paimaana hoga kisi kaa naagarik kartavya
 a large country is not identified simply by saying Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 uski pahchaan is baat se bhi hogi ki vah apni zamin par duusare mulkon ke logon ko sarvocch padon par pahunchane ke naagarik adhikaar degaa
 India has not become great in this matter
 ateet ke do chaar udaahranon se ham khush nahin ho sakate hai
 We have to get out of our duplicity
 yah nahin ho saktaa ki duusare mulkon main bharatiyon ke shikhar par pahunchane se khush hon or apane mulk main koi duusare mulk kaa sansad tak main na pahunch paae isaki raajnneeti karen
 This time in the UK parliament, Tulip Siddique, niece of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has won
 alan mak chini mul ke pehle british saansad bane hai
 Mak has said that there is no need to celebrate much about his origin
 main britain main paidaa hua hum or yahi meraa mulk he
 Obviously, authority or attachment to the country is not due to birthplace
 britain kii cricket team main hi kai baar aisi vividhta dikh jaati he, jise lekar ham punjab se lekar dilli tak main jashn manaane lagate hai
 Can you imagine Nasim Shah of Pakistani origin as his representative, whose mother has gone to jail for murdering her tortured husband
 bharat main aisi prishthbhumi kaa koi ummidavaar aa jaae to uske maa baap ko hi mudda bana denge or bheed ko uksaaya jane lagegaa ki apradhi parivaar kaa saansad banegaa to vahi karegaa jo ek apradhi karata he
 However, our record in making criminals MP should not be worse than any other country in the world
 lisa nandi vigan se or seemaa malhotra south west landan se saansad bani hai
 Suella Fernandes is an MP from Fairham and Priti Patel from Witham
 alok sharma riding west se to virendra sharma ealing southol se saansad bane hai
 Rishi Sunav, son-in-law of Infosys founder Narayana Murthy, has also been elected as an MP
 shailesh vaara ko british janata ne cambristshar north west se apana saansad chunaa he
 If you are proud of these names, then the same pride will have to be returned to the history of the world
 america britain yaa kahin bhi duusare deshon ke mul ke logon kaa chunaa janaa bataa rahaa he ki saansad hone yaa loktantric sansthaaon ko chalaane kii zimmedaari yaa paatrata kisi ke janmasthan ke mul se nahin tay hoti he
 Patriotism will not be defined on the basis of birthplace, rather it will be a measure of one's civic duty
 ek bade desh kii pahchaan sirf vasudaiv kutunbakam kehane se nahin hoti he
 He will also be identified with the fact that he will give the citizens of other countries on their land the civil rights to reach the highest positions
 is maamle main bharat abhi mahaan nahin hua he
 We cannot be happy with two or four examples of the past
 hamen apane doharepan se nikalnaa hoga
 It cannot be that Indians in other countries are happy to reach the summit and no other country in their country can reach the Parliament to do its politics
 indian neshnal lokdal supremeo omprakash chautaala ko chunavi raily karnaa baari padegaa
 The Delhi High Court has ordered Chautala to be surrendered in Tihar Jail
 chautaala ko health ground par jamaanat mili thi lekin unhone guuruuvaar ko jind main ieneldi kii chunavi raily kii
 Chautala addressed a rally in Jind on the 100th birthday of his father and former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal
 sibiai ne aaj court ko suchit kiya ki chautaala ne raily kii
 In such a situation, he can be kept in jail because the court has granted him bail on medical grounds
 sibiai kii soochna par court ne chautaala ko tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ke saamne sarender karne kaa aadesh diya
 Chautala's lawyer asked for an extension of 20 days
 chautaala ab 17 oktober ko sarender karenge
 In Haryana, the CBI court sentenced Chautala to 10 years in the JBT teacher recruitment case
 chautaala swasthya kaarnon se is samay jamaanat par hai
 The Delhi High Court granted him conditional bail only after he filed an affidavit not to go out of the National Capital Region and did not address any political public meeting, but Chautala not only came to the rally but also addressed the rally which directly- Direct court order is contempt

 Is on halaat itane badtar hai ki nadi kaa cachament aria atikaraman or sinchai ke liye bane chote-chote baandhon se simat gaya he
 Its tributary, Jojri in Jodhpur, has been destroyed due to the polluted water released from the dyeing-printing factories on the basin of the Luni River in Balotra
 jal avarodhon ke chalate 530 kimi lambii is nadi main barish kaa pani aakhri chor tak pahunch hi nahin paa rahaa he
 Starting from Ajmer, this river passes through Gandhav of Barmer and ends in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat
 is nadi kaa pravaah kshetra 37,363 varg kimi hua karata tha, jo behad simat gaya he
 Its tributaries, such as Sukdi, Mithi, Khari, Bandi, Jawai and Jojri, have also fallen into encroachment
 barmer ke balotra ilaake main sthiti yah he ki rasayanayukt pani ne jameen ke mithe pani ko jaharila kar diya he
 As a result of which diseases have spread among the people, the water mafia has been robbing people for many years in the name of giving sweet water

 In 2012, the Jodhpur High Court prohibited the release of any polluted water into the river for the purpose of saving the river
 lekin prashasan kii laaparvaahee se us faisle par amal nahin ho paa rahaa
 The government has also built large water treatment plants to prevent pollution from the textile industry in Balotra, but these are also failing

 The lyrics of Slumdog Millionaire's film Jai Ho were liked by the people
 motiyon jaise wo bol nikle the, gulzaar sahab kii kalam se
 The contribution of lyricist Gulzar to the title of Superhit to Slumdog Millionaire is no less
 safed kurtaa-pyjama or chehre par mithi muskaan vaale gulzaar sahab kii puri duniya main jai ho rahi he
 His song Jai Ho has created a boom
 duniya bhar main sirf ek hi gunj he
 Hail Hail
 auskar main bhi gunj uthaa gulzaar kaa jai ho
 
 
 Now the song Jai Ho has climbed everyone's tongue
 hameshaa se apane geeton main, apni filmon main nae-nae prayog ke liye jane jate hai gulzaar
 In Slumdog Millionaire too, he took special care of that section in his lyrics
 
 Above which is Slumdog Millionaire
 geet ke ek-ek bol main gulzaar sahab ne jaan ladaa di
 Perhaps that's why the song Jai Ho led Gulzar Saheb to the International Award Oscar for the first time
 gulzaar kii kalam se nikle jai ho gane main aam aadmi kii thasak he, to sahitya kaa rang bhi isiilie gulzaar kii kalpana main aasmaan jarivaala shaamiyana ban kar ubhara he
 Gulzar's Jai may be the reason for his song today, but it is also true that a songwriter like Gulzar may not be the same today
 unke geeton main insaan kaa wo andruni pahalu bhi ujagar hota he, jise nangi aankh se bhi dekh paanaa mumkin nahin
 Gulzar's songs are as much behind the Slumdog Millionaire's worldwide fame as the rest of the film
 bhale gulzaar kaa naam jai ho se auskar tak pahunchaa ho lekin gulzaar to wo naam he jisaki jai pichley kai dashakon se ho rahi he or kai sadiyon tak hoti rahegi

 Now the fear is what will happen in the counterattack? On Tuesday, there was a shootout in Dhanbad which brought back the story of the film Gangs of Wasseypur which came out a few years back
 ittefaq se jahaan shootout hua vahaan se vasepur kii duuri zyada nahin he
 In the film, the bomb was threatened to smoke the entire area
 jabaki hakeekat main itani goliyaan barasaai gayi ki sachmuch kuch der ke liye mauka-e-vaardaat puri tarah se dhuaan-dhuaan hi ho gaya tha
 From the smoke emanating from the bullets
 dhanbad ke ek chote se mohalle kaa naam vasepur he
 The film Gangs of Wasseypur was made on it
 isse kuch hi duuri par dhanbad ke don, koyal king or bahubali suraj dev singh kaa ghar he
 It is said that the story of Gangs of Wasseypur was woven around Suraj Dev Singh
 unheen suraj dev singh ke ghar ke bilkul saamne kiraye ke chaar kaatil kareeb das minute tak pachaas round golinaan chalaate hai
 On the vehicle in which Neeraj Singh, nephew of Surajdev Singh and former deputy mayor of Dhanbad, was sitting
 17 goli to akele niraj singh ko lagati he
 While the rest of his three friends sitting in the car
 wo teenon bhi batch nahin paae
 Climax of Gangs of Wasseypur-2 According to Sinhashmididas, the scene of Gangs of Wasseypur Part Two climax was on the road
 bas film main seen kamare ke andar bathroom main filmaaya gaya tha or hakeekat main sadak par
 But in both places, one thing was the same
 wo goliyon kaa barasana
 In this scene, in this scene, the gun is emptying on the gun, in the same way all the guns on Neeraj Singh's car were also emptied
 kehete hai ki isse pehle bhi kai baar aise shootout dekha ja chukaa he
 Is the film a series of this feast, or will it be a coincidence, or the effect of the film that many things were very similar in the bloodshed on screen and outside the screen
 masalan vahaan ek safed car thi
 The film Gangs of Wasseypur features a black SUV

 He was also a former deputy mayor of Neeraj city and was counted among the tall people of the Congress, the musclemen of the area and the great masters of the coal business
 lekin apane makaan se chand furlongs kii duuri par main road par bane in pandrah speed brakeron par jaise hi unki kaale rang kii esaviyu dhimi hui, achaanak andhadhundh goliyaan barasaani shuru kar di
 The whole area of shaharpur resonated with the sound of gunfire, the sound of gunfire echoed for about 10 minutes
 kaatil niraj singh ke katl ke liye kitni taiyaari se aae the, iskaa andaaza sirf isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone naa sirf katl ke liye speed braker vaali jagah ko chunaa, balki niraj ko maarane se pehle driver ko nishaanaa banaaya, taaki wo gaadi lekar bhaag naa sake
 After this Neeraj was hit by 17 bullets
 unke doston ko bhi goli maari gai
 a total of five people, including policeman Niraj Singh, who were terrified from the gang-up and overturned, were taken to the hospital in a hurry
 lekin aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi inamen se niraj samet chaaron kii jaan ja chuki thi

 khabar he ki dal study tour par pehle japan, phir australia ke canbera, newsolend ke christchurch, oakland or phir queenstown hote hue dubai ke raste hindustan lautega
 The biggest question on this seventeen-day study tour is that in the last year of the government, when will the minister do a foreign tour and learn what he will learn in his departments? In suppressed voice, the leaders of all the parties are also saying that if going on a tour was necessary to run the government and develop the state then why is it kept so secret
 darasal holi or gudfriday kii chuttee ke maahaul mensatta ke galiyaromen mantri or vidhayakon ke is tour kii bhanak kisi ko bhi nahin lagi
 No expenditure was given on the tour, no one is willing to give information about the program of the team members who went to the details and how much it will cost

 input:pti Morning sickness is very common in pregnancy
 is dauraan ulti aana, chakkar aana, bhukh nahin laganaa jaisi problem ho jaati hai
 This problem is normal for a while in the morning, but if you feel like this throughout the day, then it can be a matter of concern
 pregnancy ke zyaadaatar maamalon main ye lakshan shuruaati tisare or chauthe maheene main najar aate hai lekin kuch mahilaon ko puure nau maheene tak is samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Although morning sickness is not a disease, but showing too much carelessness about it can also be dangerous
 pregnancy main sharir main kai tarah ke badlaav hote hai or morning sickness usee badlaav ke kaaran hoti he
 If morning sickness persists for a long time, it can also have a bad effect on the child
 morning sickness dur karne ke upaay:-subah bistar se uthakar ghar main hi kuch kadam jarur chalem
 - Staying empty stomach can be dangerous
 agar aapako morning sickness kii problem haito subah uthakar pehle kuch khaaen phir koi kaam karen
 - Get up in the morning and have an organic tea
 isse energy milegi
 - Avoid taking too many fried and roasted things in your diet
 - sharir main calcium or vitamin kii kami nahin hone den
 Many women start taking medicines to overcome morning sickness

 Do take the advice of a doctor before taking any medicine in pregnancy or else it can have a bad effect on the child as well
 shaadi kaa sijan he or dilli, mumbai or surat jaise bade shahar to kya chote-chote kasbon tak ke sarafa bazaar band hai
 Those who used to craft fine jewelry like Ratti and Tola, have been showing their craftsmanship by making banner posters for about a fortnight
 apane pradarshan ko baakiyon se joardaar banane ke liye kahin adrdhangn hone kii vidhi apanaai ja rahi he, to kahin sarkaar kii maansik shuddhi ke liye yajna-havan kiye ja rahe hai
 It was declared as 'government terrorism' in the huge banner hanging on the railway overbridge of Pragati Maidan in Delhi
 lekin asal main hua kya he? vitt mantri arun jetali ne 29 farvari ko pesh kiye bajet main sone or anya keemtee jevaraat par ek fisadi kaa utpaada shulk laga diya he
 Also Rs two lakhs
 se adhik ke jevaraat kii kharid-farokht par pan card kaa prayog anivaary kar diya gaya
 The government clarified that these steps have been taken to bring transparency in the gold-silver and jewelery business
 upie sarkaar ke jamaane main 2012 main bhi bajet main thik aisa hi prastaav aayaa tha, jo baad main sarafa bazaar ke dabaav main waapas le liya gaya
 But this time the government is adamant
 sarkaar ne yah bhale hi na kaha ho ki yah desh main jevaraat kii kharid-bikri main hone vaale kaale dhan ke prayog par ankush lagane kii ek pahal he, lekin asal main yah usee disha main uthaaya gaya ek kadam he
 It is accepted that whatever transaction of money is out of the account, it is actually black money, whether the amount is high or low
 maje kii baat he ki na to sarkaar or na hi sarafa vyapaaree 'kaale dhan' shabd kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 If the government is calling it transparency, then the opposing bullion traders are calling it the return of Inspector Raj

 The strike will continue till the government withdraws the 1% excise duty

 On March 4, the Central Board for Excise and Customs (CBEC) issued a clarification to remove the traction of traders who had come to inspector Raj
 isamen saaf kaha gaya he ki 12 karod ru
 Only bullion traders doing more than a year of business have to pay an excise duty of one percent
 12 karod se kam kaa kaarobaar karne vaale vyapaariyon ko 6 karod ru
 Business will be exempted from excise duty
 iskaa vyaavhaarik arth yah hua ki agar koi vyapaaree 10 karod ru
 If he does an annual business, he gets four crores
 ke kaarobaar par hi utpaada shulk chukaana he
 Explaining how big this relief is, a CBEC official said, "only 1 to cottage industries
 5 karod ru
 The excise duty is exempted only till the turnover of kutir udyogon ko sabase kamjor udyog kii shrenee main mana jaataa he
 In comparison, the bullion business has received four times more leeway
 '' kaarobaariyon ke andeshon ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar ne spasht kiya he ki kaarobaari apane kaarobaar ke bare main kisi chartered accountint se kul byoraa banavaakar jamaa kara sakate hai, kisi surat main inspector unki dukaan par jaanch karne nahin aayega
 The government has also removed the fear of traders that they have to disclose their stock
 sarkari spashtikaran main is bhashaa kaa upyog vaise to 'inspector rajya ke andeshe ko dur karne ke liye kiya gaya he, lekin isamen shaayad yah sanket chupa hua he ki sarkaar gharelu kaale dhan par utani sakht nahin ho rahi, jitna vyapaaree samaj rahe hai
 But the traders are not convinced on all these things
 meerut ke ek sarafa kaarobaari asal dar bataate hai, ''sarkaar lakh kahati rahe, lekin ham logon ne inspector raaj dekha he
 If an inspector comes to investigate, it will not be illegal
 sone ke kaam bade vyapaariyon ko chhod den to zyaadaatar chote sunar yaa johari nakad main kaam kar rahe hai
 Credit and credit business is also going on with us
 kaarigaron ko bazaar ke hisaab se mehtaanaa miltaa he
 We will make everything legal
 ''vyapaariyon ko dar he ki bhale hi chote kaarobaari ko utpaada shulk na chukaana pade lekin vah jitna bhi kaarobaar ghoshit karegaa, uskaa hisaab-kitaab to rakhana padegaa
 This means that you have to tell where you bought and sold gold

 These are made by different people
 jevar ke ek-ek hisse kaa hisaab rakhana apane aap main kathin kaam he
 For this, separate people will have to be employed

 Chokri is moving, giving direction to the dimensions of the verses
 i say this, Monalisakasi of Sarjupar, it is frightening
 Iqal had this speech, but how silent is it today, who is the reason for its silence, this was the day of the monsoon, Haat Koso was old, the old bed was covered in the porch, Khat Kodubati used to play the rays of the sun, he was coming from the field, taking a bundle of sand seaghas
 Was she lost in lost emotion? Did she know that there is a wolf, unaware of the ambush, Krishna wandered on the road in unmarked paths and saw the stranger in arms She was suffocated in the roof, the first fall was then loose and then collapsed, the day was in Sarju's basins
 When the virginity was burnt in the fire of fire, and the mansion was laughing that day, it was laughing, there was Krishna, there was a crowd in the father's lap, which was loud enough to listen to him
 How are you silent, then who is the last person from the daughter, no matter who is struggling, we will not bend our feet and will not leave them alive, how can it be said that we can avoid And these enemies blacken the face of daughter-in-law Bola Krishna's sister cannot sleep and can not resist my request, that sinner fell in my vengeance

 Having lost his heart, he was lying at the entrance of the hut to the occupants again
 The policeman said, "what do you see, my mouth!" Bring spit in its mouth and blow its hut too 'and then a storm of vengeance started burning there, the hut of unarmed people, the young child and the old man who was there in the field, he was in the circle of the unfortunate oppressed crowd, seeing the house burning, they started losing consciousness

 If Lalu Prasad Yadav was so ill, he should have taken an air lift or at least admitted to the IGIMS ICU 
 unke bete bihar ke swasthya mantri hai to kya pad kaa durupyog karte hue keval sardi, khaasi or dast jaisi maamuli bimariyon ke liye darjanon doctoron kii tainaati uchit he
 Modi said that there is a shortage of doctors in IGIMS, in such a situation, how far it is appropriate to deploy poor doctors at the residence for eight-eight days
 modi ne kaha kilalu yadamgar gambhir biimaar the to unhen air lift karke dilli kyon nahin le jaaya gaya, aspataal main bhartee karana chahie tha, iskaa matlab wo gambhir biimaar nahin the
 If seriously ill, the service that can be done in the hospital is not at home
 koi vyakti jepi jaisaa biimaar he, umr bahut ho gai ki aspataal le janaa sambhav nahin he aise main aadhe darjan kya puure idiai kii seva de di jaae lalu ji ke liye main uskaa virodh nahin karuunga
 But a minor illness occurred such a day every day the leaders have to face it
 aise main roj aijises ko band kar dijie or tamaam doctoron ko lalu ke parivaar main laga dijiye
 Modi said that even if his son was a health minister and he would not have been a former chief minister, if there is a former MLA, he should be served, he should have complete medical care
 lekin sawaal ye he ki kya wo gambhir biimaar the, agar gambhir biimaar the to kyon nahin unhen dilli air ambulance se le jaaya gaya, or yahaan kyon nahin isiu main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 It is a proof that he was not seriously ill, if he was seriously ill and all the doctors should be stopped by IGISS and put a dozen not 50 doctors, i will support him to save Lalu Yadav's life
 lekin ye to ek puraane jamaane ke jameendaar he or nae raja hai
 The son is the health minister and if the father was so ill, then the enemy was chanting Maran instead of worrying about the father, and leaving the patients of Bihar like this, sitting in the AC car and went to Vrindavan
 ye majaak kar rahe hai
 The Kshvi of Bihar is infamous for such things, when Lalu ji was the Chief Minister, cloth was torn Holi
 kya-kya nahin hota tha
 Then Bihar has returned to those old days
 roj ek nakaaratmak samachar
 Commenting on Rabri Devi and Nitish Kumar, former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Modi said, "rabri ji is saying that i want a girl who does not go to the mall for sons and the son for whom she is looking for such a girl
 The largest 750 crore mall is being built in Bihar
 ye majaak nahin to kya ho rahaa he
 So Nitish ji is not due to the people of Bihar, not because of the people whom you are with whom you are giving protection, due to which the area of bihar is getting spoiled

 gujarat kii raajnneeti main chunaav se pehle baari ulatpher dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 Particularly, Patidar leader Hardik Patel is seen stuck in the mind
 ek taraf congress ne patidaaron kii aarakshan maang par apana rukh spasht nahin kiya he, vahiin duusari taraf hardik ke kareebi lagaataar bijepi ke paale main ja rahe hai
 In this episode, a name has been added on Saturday
 patidaar andolan ke prasiddh netaa rahe kethan patel shanivaar ko bhartiya janata party jwine karne ja rahe hai
 Ketanketan Patel, very close to Hardik, was once considered a shadow of Hardik Patel
 aarakshan andolan ke dauraan wo hardik ke ird-gird najar aate the
 However, the two later parted ways
 kethan par rajdroh kaa maamla darj tha
 After which he also became a witness against Hardik
 ab unke haath main bijepi kaa jhanda hoga
 For Hardik, this is not considered as a big blow, but the leaders of the Patidar Reservation are constantly going to the BJP and it seems that this whole movement has some effect
 isse pehle hardik ke behad kareebi reshma patel or varun patel ne bhi bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 After joining BJP, these leaders accused Hardik of betraying Patel society
 in donon ke alaava chiraag patel or mahesh patel bhi patidaaron ko chhod sattadhari bijepi ke saath ja chuke hai
 Big challenge for Hardik: Gujarat election is currently coming as a big challenge for Hardik
 bijepi ke virodh or use haraane kaa hardik khuleam elaan kar chuke hai
 They are making strong statements against him in public meetings
 vikalp ke taur par hardik congress se deal main jute hue hai
 Talk has been made on many issues, but no way has been found out on reservation
 congress ne kanoonee visheshgyon se patidaaron ko aarakshan par vichaar-vimarsh bhi kiya, baavjood iske party abhi tak koi antim nirnay nahin le pai he
 On the other hand, there has also been discussion on tickets in Congress
 haalanki, ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan nahin kiya gaya he
 But the Patidar leaders who reached Delhi on Friday did not get time to meet the Congress leaders
 jiske baad unhone khule taur congress ko 24 ghante kaa ultimate de daalaa
 In such a situation, the question is, does the Congress want to take advantage of Hardik's helplessness on its own terms, or is Hardik Patel in a mood to make his political debut apart from bjp-congress? agar aap bhartiya sena main janaa chaahate hai or desh kii seva karnaa chaahate hai
 So good chance has come for you

 is vakt devendra fadanvis maharashtra ke sabase akele pade netaa najar aa rahe hai
 The result of the bjp's lack of seats in the assembly elections was that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray refused to give him the green signal for a second term as Chief Minister
 fadanvis, thakare ko 'kareebi dost' bataate hai, par ve satta main baraabar kii bhagidaari kii maang par ade thakare kii koi najdiki paane main naakaam ho rahe hai
 Fadnavis says that the BJP and Shiv Sena had never discussed partnership in the Chief Minister's post
 unke isi rukh ne thakare ko bhaajapa kii niyat par andeh karne kii vajahen de deen
 He immediately sent his trusted aide and party leader in the Rajya Sabha, Sanjay Raut, to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar to explore alliance possibilities
 raut ne lautakar daawa kar diya ki sena ko 161 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he
 On November 4, he announced to reporters, "the next chief minister will definitely be from the Shiv Sena
" ''raut kaa ganit is tark par aadhaarit he ki ensipi (54 seat) or congress (44 seat) shivasena (56 seat) ko samarthan dengi
 Also, with the support of 7 independents, it will form the government
 ensipi ke ek netaa ne kaha ki party sena ke saath milakar sarkaar bana sakati he jise congress baahar se samarthan de
 Working wisely, Pawar neither denied nor supported the possibility of supporting the army
 ve 4 november ko dilli main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se bhi mili or patrakaron se kaha, ''philhal hamen gathbandhan ke bare main shivasena se koi prastaav nahin mila he
 In such a situation, how can we take a decision? ”political analysts believe that Pawar is helping Thackeray enter into a strong deal with the BJP by fueling the prospects of an alliance in the ncp-sena
 apane rukh main thodi narmi kaa sanket dete hue bhaajapa ne bhi mantralayon ko lekar udaartaa dikhaane kii koshish kii he or kaha he ki vah mukhyamantri kii kursi or grih vibhaag ko chhodkar baaki kisi bhi mantralay ko sena ko saunpane par baat kar sakati he
 Fadnavis is still assuming that he will form the government
 unhone 4 november ko kaha, ''main is bare main koi pratikriya nahin duungaa ki satta ke sameekaran par koun kya baat kar rahaa he
 Maharashtra needs a new government at the earliest and it will be formed soon
 ''fadanvis ne 4 november ko bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat kii
 He hoped that Shah would help in crossing the Naiya in Maharashtra
 par shah ne bich main padane se manaa kar diya or unhen rajya str par hi maamla sulajhane ko kaha
 Senior BJP leaders in the state Nitin Gadkari, Eknath Khadse and Pankaja Munde are also not helping them
 lihaaja fadanvis akele pad gaye hai
 However, his colleagues like Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan insist, "they are not alone, workers like me are with them
" ''november kaa doosraa saptaah rajya kii bhavi raajnneeti kii disha tay karne main ahm rahegaa
 The tenure of the current assembly and Fadnavis ends on 8 November
 agar ensipi-sena milakar sarkaar banaati hai to ayodhya ke ram mandir maamle main supreme court kaa faisla bhi isamen ahm bhoomika nibhaayega ki dakshinpanthi shivasena ko congress samarthan degi yaa nahin

 The controversy started over scooty parking at the Gali Durga temple in Lal Kuan area of old Delhi
 ilaake main tanaav he jise kaabo main rakhane ke liye badi taadaad main police bal tainaat he
 This whole matter is around 10 pm on Sunday night
 darasal, gali durga mandir ke paas kuch ladke sharaab pi rahe the
 At the same time, a boy from another community living in a nearby street came there and started to park his scooty
 pehle se maujuud ladakon ne use aisa karne se roka, magar jab wo ladkaa nahin mana to nashe main dhut ladke hathapayee par utar aae
 In this fight, the boy's hand was fractured
 jaise hi ye khabar ghayal ladke kii gali tak pahunchi uski gali ke log ikattha hue or sharaab pi rahe ladakon kii jamkar pitayee kar di

 Priyanka, the secret behind the alliance with SP in UP, is still absent from the campaign
 lekin parde ke peeche apni sena ko upi ke ran ke liye taiyaar kar rahi hai
 In this case, in front of Priyanka, Congress leaders have demanded to campaign in all the seats in front of Priyanka, but Priyanka is focusing on preparing more than campaigning

 priyanka kuch asahaj dikhti hui bhi shant raheen or sabase haste hue dikhaai deen
 Actually the real challenge is for the party and Priyanka to bring good results in the UP elections
