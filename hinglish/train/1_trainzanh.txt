 isamen amitabh bachchan or taapasi pannu mukhya bhoomika main he
 Its trailer was recently released
 khabare hai ki isamen shahrukh bhi chemiyo role main hai
 However, director Sujoy Ghosh has not confirmed this
 film ke pramotion ke liye shahrukh or amitabh ne ek special video bhi shoot kiya he
 Badla is releasing next month on 8 March
 televijan par sabase lokapriy krime sho kii ankaring karte-karte vah khud criminal ban baitha
 The fate of Suhayb Ilyasi, who had once become the eye of the eyes of the dreaded criminals across the country, was decided by a court in Delhi today
 apni hi patni kii hatya ke aaropee suhaib ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Along with this, the court has also fined Ilyasi with a fine of ten lakh rupees
 krime sho 'indiaj most wanted' ke jariye kitne hi mujarimon ko pakadvane vaale suhaib ne apni patni kii hatya kar suicide kii script to joardaar likhi thi, lekin kanoon kii paini nigahon se vah khud ko nahin bachaa sakaa
 Although the government lawyer had demanded the death penalty for Suhayb, who was convicted in the case, the court gave life imprisonment
 parivaar ke vakil ne kaha ki ye gunahon par serial banaata tha
 People used to watch it, but after learning from it, they executed this incident
 isane hatya ke maamle ko aatmahatya dikhaane kii koshish kii
 This is a case of heinous crime
 usase pehle suhaib ne kaha, 'main bekasoor hum
 i will appeal against this order in the Upper Court
 hoicourt main saare saboot le kar jaaoongaa
 'he said,' i hope i get justice there
 mere khilaaf koi thos saboot nahin he
 His lawyer said that the entire case is based on circumstantial evidence
 iskaa koi chashmadid gavaah nahin he
 So this case cannot be classified as rare
 iske alaava is maamle main barbarta yaa suniyojit sajeesh nahin kii gai he
 After starting his crime show in 1998, Suhayb became a prominent face of the television world
 dekhte hi dekhte suhaib eliyasi kaa naam is sho ke jariye femes ho gaya
 But a crime committed 17 years ago stripped him of all his stardom
 11 janvari 2000 ko suheb kii patni anju eliyasi kii rahasyamayi haalat main maut ho gai thi
 Initially, Suhayb was successful in throwing dust in the eyes of the police
 usne apni patni kii hatya ko suicide kii kahani bana di
 But 17 years later, on this same Saturday, the Delhi lower court convicted Suhaib Ilyasi for Anju's death
 ab bas sajaa kaa elaan hona he
 Suhayb described his wife's death as suicide, but it was his own script
 hakeekat yah he ki usne apni patni kii hatya kii thi
 Ilyasi first reported the death of his wife to his friend
 suhaib ne apane dost ko bataaya ki uski patni anju ne suicide kar liya he
 But as soon as the family members of Anju came to know about this, they accused that Anju cannot commit suicide, but he has been murdered
 police ne maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kii or march 2000 main suhaib eliyasi ko dahej hatya ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya
 But after some time he came out on the vine
 anju kaa parivaar police kii jaanch se khush nahin tha
 They reached the High Court regarding the case
 saal 2014 main hai court ne police se kaha ki hatya kii dhaaraon main mukademe kii jaanch kii jaae
 Police started investigation
 phir nae sire se subooton kii padtaal shuru hui
 During investigation, the police found that Suhayb Ilyasi murdered his wife
 hatya kanchi se kii gai thi
 Actually, the suit which Anju wore was not cut by katchi
 itnaa hi nahin postmortem karne vaale 3 doctoron main se ek doctor ne bhi hatya kaa shaq jataayaa tha
 After this, another panel of 5 doctors was formed
 un doctoron ne anju kii maut par hatya kaa shaq jaataa diya
 Actually Anju died at 10
45 am, while Suhayb reached him with AIIMS at 12:26
 police ko bathroom main bhi khun ke nishaan mili the
 Not only this, it was also revealed in the investigation that there was often a quarrel between the two and their relationship had soured
 saare sabooton ko police ne court ke saamne rakhaa or court ne suhaib eliyasi ko hatya kaa doshi qaraar diya
 Today, the Karkardooma court of Delhi will now announce the punishment for Suhaib for his crimes
 suhaib eliyasi or anju saal 1989 main jamiya milia islamia main ek saath pard rahe the
 That's when the two fell in love
 anju ke ghar waalon ne is relation ko lekar virodh kiya
 The two then moved to London
 gharavaalon ke virodh ke baavjood suhaib or anju ne saal 1993 main landan main shaadi kar lee
 The script that Suhayb prepared for his crime was very vicious
 usne apane gunaah or gunaah ke nishaan ko is kadar mitaayaa ki ekbar to uski kahani par sabko yakeen hone laga tha
 But ultimately due to the complete investigation of the police, his script proved to be false

 Now only a few hours are left for the results of the assembly elections of five states, including UP, but all eyes are on up's results
 india today-exis maay india agsit pole main bijepi ko upi main purna bahumat kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he lekin antim nattejey 11 march ko matganana ke baad hi aaenge
 If the situation of the hung assembly comes, then the circumstances of the alliance will be formed
 ham aisa isliye kah rahe hai ki khud akhilesh yadav ne mayawati ke saath jane ke sanket die hai
 Anything is possible in politics
 agar gathbandhan kii sthiti hogi to kya honge upi ke saamne vikalp?vikalp-1: bijepi ko bispi kaa samarthanvaise agsit pole main bijepi ko purna bahumat kaa anumaan he lekin kuch agsit pole bijepi ko sabase bade dal ke rup main dikhaa rahe hai
 If this happens, the BJP may need the support of the BSP
 chunaav ke baad trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main bijepi or bispi ke bich gathbandhan kii sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 If BJP becomes a big party, then BSP can support it
 pehle bhi donon dal milakar sarkaar bana chuke hai
 However, there was a lot of ruckus between the leaders of both parties in the election rallies, but nothing is impossible in politics
 sapa-congress ko rokane ke liye donon dal phir ek saath aa sakate hai
 Mayawati may also try to reinvigorate her political ground by joining up with the central government and joining the power of UP
 loksabhaa chunaavon main bispi kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha or sabakuch ab vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon par nirbhar karegaa
 Option-2: bjp's support to the BSP If the BSP emerges as the largest party, then the BJP can also support it
 isse ek taraf to vah upi kii satta main shaamil ho sakati he yaa baahar se samarthan dekar apane prabhaav se upi main siyaasi jameen majboot kar sakati he or saath hi congress or sapa ko satta se dur rakhkar unhen phir se ubharne kaa mauka nahin dekar apana prabhaav badhaane kii koshish karegi
 Option-3: If the BJP does not get a majority in UP if the BSP does not get the majority support from the sp-congress, then the opposition parties may come together to prevent it from coming to power
 bijepi ko rokane ke liye sapa-congress bispi ko baahar se yaa sarkaar main shaamil hokar samarthan de sakate hai
 Everything is possible in politics
 khud akhilesh yadav ne iske sanket die hai
 Akhilesh Yadav said that he can go with BSP to stop BJP
 haalanki, bispi ne abhi apane pattey nahin khole hai
 All parties from UP can unite on the fact that BJP cannot get a chance to prepare political ground in UP
 vikalp-4: sapa-congress ko bispi kaa samarthanagar sapa-congress gathbandhan ke paas adhik siten hon to bispi use baahar se samarthan kar sakati he
 All these parties can come together to stop the BJP from power
 bispi bhale sarkaar main shaamil na ho lekin bijepi ko upi kii satta se dur rakhane main use kai phaayde dikhenge
 One is that by using her influence in power, she can look into the preparations for the 2019 elections and will try to overcome the last time
 ye tabhi sambhav hoga jab upi main bijepi kaa prabhaav kam rahe or bispi ye jaanati he ki ye tabhi sambhav he jab bijepi ko lakhanu se dur rakhaa jaae
 Option-5: The way the Samajwadi Party and Congress, which are considered to be anti-sp parties for the SP assembly elections with small parties, have joined hands and now there are signs of close proximity to Mayawati
 usee tarah chunaav ke baad nae sameekaran saamne aa sakate hai
 If the sp-congress stays close to the majority, a coalition government can be formed with many smaller parties
 kai aise dal hai jinka apane-apane ilaakon main prabhaav hai or ve nai sthiti main apni ranneeti phir se taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Such as RLD, Peace Party, Owaisi's Party AIMIM etc
 haalanki, chunaav ke antim nattejey aane par hi tasviir saaf hogi

 Actually, it can also cause health problems like mutual stress and heart disease
 adhyayan ke dauraan shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki ausat jodon ko apane saathi ke saath sone par tulanaatmak rup se 50 pratishat zyada baar neend main khalal kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 It is not a sign of affinity According to the report of The Daily Telegraph, people also ignore the disturbing effects such as snoring, gnashing of teeth and frequent turning, thinking that gold is traditionally a sign of affinity
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki pareshaani ko dur karne ke liye yaa to alag-alag sona chaiye yaa phir sehat kharaab hone athwa talaak hone ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chaiye
 There is also good sleep, said Neil Stanley, chief researcher at Zurinorfolk and Norwich University Hospital, "sleep has its own importance
 khaane or kasarat karne kii tarah raat main acchhee neend bhi bahut jaruri he
 Affinity is good for emotional health but good sleep is necessary for physical and mental health

 ) yuva patidaar netaa hardik patel kii jubaani congress jo sunanaa chaahati thi, aakhir wo unhone kah hi diya
 Hardik announced his support for 'pawn' without meeting Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 hardik or unke numaayindon se abhi tak congress kii ore se party ke gujarat prabharee ashok gahalot, varisht netaa or janemaane vakil kapil sibbal hi baat kar rahe the
 The Congress had decided that Hardik should first announce the 'deal', only then he will be met with Rahul Gandhi
 hardik kii koshish yahi rahi ki ‘deal’ main congress se zyada se zyada hasil kiya jaae
 From November 1, Hardik kept raising the deadline several times
 aakhirkaar 22 november ko hardik ne saare gile-shikave dur hone ke baad congress ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya
 In fact, both the Congress and Hardik Patel tried not to give the BJP a chance to say that Hardik was playing in the lap of Congress or that Hardik was an agent of Congress
 isiilie saamaanya tareeke se yaa phir hardik ko jhukaa kar samjhauta karte nahin dikhaanaa tha
 In such a situation, Hardik was seen adopting a 'hard bargaining' attitude in front of the Congress
 hardik BJP ke virodh kii baat to shuru se karte rahe lekin saath hi unhone patidaar samudaay ke liye congress ke saamne 5 maange rakhin jinamein se congress ne 4 maan leen
 Bus reservation was a tricky issue
 sanvaidhanik aadhaar par aarakshan kaa pech fansaa tha
 Seeing the seriousness of the situation, Congress put forward Kapil Sibal, a constitutional expert and senior advocate
 kapil sibbal ne sabhi pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhkar formula sujhaayaa
 It was also accepted by Hardik and his team
 lekin ye sab hote hue bhi donon pakshon main ‘tanatani’ kaa sandesh lagaataar diya jaataa rahaa
 The effort was that from outside it could be seen that Hardik is fighting the Congress for the interests of the people of his community and is moving towards compromise on his own terms
 har kisi ko ye jaanane main dilchaspee thi ki aakhir sibbal ne aisa koun sa formula sujhaayaa jise hardik ke saath ‘patidaar anamat andolan samiti’ (PASS) ne bhi sahmati de di
 Here is the formula - there is no change in 49% reservation of SC / ST / OBC
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 31 ( c ) ko dhyaan main rakhte hue samvidhan ke anuchhed 46 ke praavdhaan par congress kii sarkaar aane kii sthiti main bill vidhansabha main paas karaayaa jayega
 -the communities mentioned in Article 46 and those who did not get benefits under Articles 15 (4) and 15 (6) of the Constitution, will be made a special category to give equal justice in education and government jobs to the communities so that they like OBC Only you can get all the benefits
 -is kanoon ke antargat special ketegory main shaamil karne walesamudaay ko nischitakarne ke liye rajya sarkaar kii ore se tamaam hitdharakon (stekholders) ke saath salaah karke ek kamishan kaa gathan kiya jayega
 Apart from this, the formation of a commission has also been said from one side for the economically backward people to have equal opportunities for education and economic procurement
 jin baton par sahmati bani unhen congress ke chunaav ghoshnaa patr main bhi shaamil kiya jayega
 The Congress and Hardik had a 'hearty rapport', but as it was delayed for the past few weeks, BJP was becoming more and more aggressive on Hardik
 is bich hardik ko bhi ye jaanane kaa mauka mil gaya ki unke saath ke kitne patidaar netaa chhitak kar bijepi ke paale main ja milte hai
 Had it happened just before the vote, it would have been more shocking for Hardik
 yahi vajah he ki hardik ‘tel dekho, tel kii dhar dekho’ vaali niti par chalate rahe
 This is the reason why Hardik started screwing the tickets of some people of his community and pressurizing the Congress
 aakhirkaar congress ne ghoshnaa karne ke baad 4 ummidavaaron ko badal diya
 Hardik did not stop here, after this he again postponed his press conference
 iske baad congress ne ek or ummidavaar badla
 Hardik then announced at the press conference on Wednesday that the Congress wanted to listen
 congress kii koshish yahi thi ki rahul gandhi ke 24, 25 november ko gujarat daure pehle hardik ke elaan se maahaul ban jaae
 In fact, Congress strategically introduced Rahul to OBC leader Alpesh Thakor in one visit, to Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani in one
 agle daure main rahul or hardik ke saarvajanik taur par saath aane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Actually, Hardik had come so far in opposition to the BJP from where there was no way left to go anywhere else
 hardik or congress donon hi acchhee tarah jaanate the ki aapas main haath milaane main hi donon kaa phayda he
 An official announcement to hold each other on Wednesday was also made

 It is reported that students of IIT, one of the most prestigious institutes in the country, could not be more successful in getting jobs this year

 wateep (whatsapp) jasusi cond main centre sarkaar ne bhale hi kaha ho ki uskaa isamen koi haath nahin he lekin is maamlen congress ke varisht netaa kapil sibbal ne sarkaar ko gherte hue paanch saal puche hai
 He said that Israeli company NSO sells spyware Pegasus only to governments
 isse pehle watsape kii ore se hamaari sarkaar ko koi jawaab diya jaae in sawaalon ke uttar milane jarur milane chahie
 Kapil Sibal asked- Which government department bought Pegasus, what is its cost, who was in the operation, who directed the spying, and which other platforms have been tampered with
 gauratlab he ki watsape kii ore se kai bharatiyon ko is baat kii soochna di gai he ki israeli company ke spiware Pegasus kaa istemaal karke unki jasusi kii gai he
 According to whatsapp, citizens of 20 countries have been spied through this spyware
 Israeli NSO sold spyware Pegasus only to Governments Before whatsapp answers our Govt
 must tell us : 1) Which wing of Govt
 purchased Pegasus 2) At what price 3) Who handled it's operations 4) Who gave instructions for snooping 5) Which other platforms are compromised US President Barack Obama has suffered a setback
 unke dwaara jis anti-outsorcing bill kii vakaalat kii ja rahi he, vah seenet main paarit nahin ho sakaa
 This has greatly benefited India because outsourcing benefits India a lot
 vipakshi republican saansadon ne seenet main is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or yah bill 53-45 vot se naamanzoor kar diya gaya
 a minimum of 60 votes were required to pass the bill
 america raashtrapati is bill ke samarthak hai
 They believe this will open up employment opportunities for American youth, but the Senate has ruled it out
 america seenet ke 37 seenetteron ke liye 2 november ko chunaav hona he
 President Barack Obama has been very supportive of this bill during the election campaign
 unke anusaar ab america se outsorcing par niyantran lagaaya janaa chahie jisase sthaneey yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke or avasar paidaa hon
 He warned that companies who do outsourcing will not be given the benefit of tax exemption
 america or bharat ke soochna praudyogiki se jude kai visheshgy outsorcing ke mudde par america raashtrapati ke ravaiye par virodh jataa chuke hai
 American companies largely get their work done better by outsourcing from India for less
 isse badi sankhya main bharatiyon ko naukari to milti he, lekin america companiyon kaa bhi bada phayda hota he
 Therefore, American industry is also against this policy of Obama
 republican seenetter orin hech ne democrates kii kadi aalochana karte hue kaha ki outsorcing par unka ravaiya puri tarah gaiyr jimmedaarana he
 This will cause further damage to the American economy
 yah america arthvyavastha ko hui beemaari kaa ilaaj nahin he
 Second senator Chuk Grassley also supported Hatch, saying that it would have reduced employment opportunities rather than increased
 iske alaava yadi yah bill paarit ho jaataa to isse america companiyon ko kaaphi nuksaan bhi hota
 Democrats are disappointed at the passage of the bill in the Senate
 ek damocratic saansad harry read ke anusaar yah to saamaanya gyaan kii baat he ki is bill se america yuvaaon ko kaaphi laabh hota, lekin republican seenetteron kii vajah se aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Applying the wounds of the Congress, the Samajwadi Party today said that despite the decision by the Center to remove its ministers from the cabinet, there is no threat to the central government as the party will continue its support to the government
 samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh ne dramuk ke nirnay ke bare main puche jane par ravivaar ko lakhanu main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 He is not in the minority
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘sapa kaa kendra sarkaar ko samarthan he or jari rahegaa
 'will the Samajwadi Party with 22 members in the Lok Sabha join the government? Mulayam Singh deferred the question by saying that it was a fantasy
 unhone kaha, ‘sapa ke sarkaar main shaamil hone ke bare main koi baatcheet nahin chal rahi
 'not paying much heed to the deadlock over the seat-sharing between the Congress and the DMK in Tamil Nadu, Mulayam Singh said that this is not an important matter,' talks are going on between the leaders of both parties
 darasal congress ke netaa kal raat vahaan pahunche or baatcheet kar rahe hai
 There are differences over seat sharing and positions, but efforts are being made to resolve the matter
 unhone kaha, ‘yah dekhnaa hoga ki dramuk mantriyon ke istife ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he yaa nahin
 Such things happen in coalitions
 ’yah puche jane par ki sarkaar main shaamil hone ke bare main kya pradhanmantri ke saath unki koi baatcheet hui, mulaayam singh ne kaha ki is tarah kii koi baatcheet nahin hui
 He said, 'we often have telephone conversations
 teen din pehle pradhanmantri ne mujhe phone kiya or kaha ki loksabhaa main gatirodh or desh ke suraksha sahit kuch maamalon par unase baat karnaa chaahate hai
 In Delhi, Samajwadi Party spokesperson and general secretary Mohan Singh termed the decision to withdraw the DMK ministers from the Congress-led UPA government as an "internal battle of power sharing" between the two parties
 singh ne kaha, ‘main dramuk ko 1980 se dekh rahaa hum
 He is one of the biggest bargaining political parties
 to kuch din main vah kisi sahmati par pahunch sakati he
 At the moment, we are only playing the role of silent spectator

 Ashwin Krishna Shraddha is performed from Pratipada to Amavasya
 7 sitambar se 20 sitambar tak is varsh pitru paksh rahenge
 Shraddha has been given a special status in Indian culture
 shraadh kya he? shraadh kyon karen? shraadh kii kya aavashyaktaa he? in prashnon par vichaar karen to kai upyogi baaten saamne aati hai
 You will know that Shraddha means devotional expression, which is done to the delight of the demons, great men, sages, gurus and ancestral men
 vaarshik shraadh bhi jo kiye jate hai, usamen shraddhabhaav kaa, pitru purushon ke upakaaron ke liye unke prati aabhaar vyakt karne kii bhakthi bhaavana pradarshit karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 In all these efforts, they are worshiped with pinddaan from Vedic legislation along with their worship and worship for the fulfillment of the ancestors
 pind to pratik bhar hote hai, asli samparn shraddha-bhaavana hi hoti he
 The same becomes the medium to please the ancestors, gods, sages and great men
 vaise shraadh jab bhi kiya jaae uttam he
 a full 365 days of twelve months is better if reverence for the deities
 puja-upasna jitani adhik ho, utana acha
 The greater the devotion, the greater the devotion of devotion to God and Pitradi
 pitru paksh kaa shraadh aisa he ki nity yadi shraddharpan na ban pade to naimitthik sahi, karte rahanaa chahie
 The real reverence is the daily worship of the deity, the worship of the ancestors, the worship of the sage spirits and the worship of the God of truth
 yah jitna adhik ho sake unta hi satya kii nikatataa praapt hone kaa avasar miltaa he
 We should strive for this maximum devotion
 ek mahanubhavi ne acchhee tukbandi kii he- If possible, they should be settled in breath
 palakane kii jarurat nahin, aankh munde hi dekha jaae
 Don't search here and find there, just go here now
 yah rahe na vah rahe, bas ham hi ham ho harsa jaae
 If the reverence reaches this extent, then it should be understood that the shraddha became meaningful
 shraddha yadi satya ko chhu le to samajhnaa chahie shraadh dhanya ho gaya
 What did you do once a year in Shraddha? The obeisance should be at all times, every moment, every moment
 hamen dev purushon, pitar purushon, divyatmaon or ishwariya satta ke jitna adhik ashish mili, utana hi ahobhagya he
 Along with Shraddha, there is one more thing worth talking about
 ham ishwar yaa pitar purushon se sukh saubhaahgya kii kaamana karte hai
 Good luck does not come from God alone
 unke rachit is suvistrut nisarg main bhi vah maujuud he jo panch mahabhuton se nirmit he
 The Earth is closest to us in these ghosts, is the basis of habitat and food
 isamen ann jal hi nahin, vriksh vanaspati bhi hamaare jivit evam swasth rahane main sahaayak hote hai

 From this point of view, we also have a duty to prevent plantation of vegetation, so plantation should be done
 haalanki van pradeshon main rahane waalon ko shaayad isaki aavashyaktaa upyogita kam maaloom pade, parantu registan main jaakar dekhie vrikshon kaa kya mahatv he
 When the heat of the hot sand is dying out of unbearable heat, only then the importance of the lush green earth's green area is understood
 isiilie ped lagane kaa kram bhi shraadh ke saath-saath karte rahanaa chahie
 Just as Pitar is our foster nutrient, similarly trees are also our life guards
 unke bina kisi bhi prakaar sukh saubhaahgya kii sambhaavna nahin ban sakati
 So, on the occasion of Shraddha, we pay obeisance to the ancestors, god spirits and sage spirits on one side and on the other hand, plant one plant each on the earth's dock
 hariyaali rahegi, tabhi ham rahenge or satya ke nikat pahunchane vaali shraddhabhivyakti-shraadh karmo ko karne kaa suavasar hamen milegaa
 If possible, they should be settled in breath
 palakane kii jarurat nahin, aankh munde hi dekha jaae
 Don't search here and find there, just go here now
 yah rahe na vah rahe, bas ham hi ham ho harsa jaae

 ’’ Looking at the developments of the Samajwadi Party in the last two months, no one can predict the SP and its leaders from the claims, but looking at the situation today, it is more likely that in the next month's Assembly elections, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is himself the party
 k will be the star campaigner
 agar aisa hota he to unki patni or kannauj se saansad dimple yadav kii bhoomika chunaav prachaar main kaaphi ahm hogi
 Dimple Yadav, Lok Sabha MP from Dimplekannauj, who has gained enough experience in politics, will turn 39 on the 15th of this month
 akhilesh yadav se unki shaadi ko puure 17 saal ho chuke hai
 Her entry into politics was in 2009 when the Samajwadi Party fielded her as a candidate for the Firozabad seat left by her husband Akhilesh Yadav
 haalanki dimple ye mahatvapurn chunaav haar gayi lekin teen saal baad 2012 main vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye jab akhilesh ne kannauj seat bhi chhod di to vahaan se dimple nirvirodh jeetne main safal raheen
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Dimple managed to save her seat of Kannauj even when the opposition's vote bank was being blown in the storm of Modi all over UP
 unhone bijepi ke subrat pathak ko takreeban 20 hajaar voton ke antar se haraaya
 This time the responsibility of Dimple will be increased
 If Akhilesh Yadav contests elections on his own alone, after him the star campaigner of the party will be Dimple Yadav
 kaaryakarta abhi se 'vikaas kii chaabi-dimple bhabhi' jaise naare garh rahe hai
 Dimple Yadav has also been involved in campaigning in the past
 lekin abhi tak ve parivaar kii bahu ke role main zyada dikhi hai
 Since this time Akhilesh's election campaign is going to be more of a one-man show, it will be the responsibility of Dimple Yadav to conduct election meetings in favor of the party where Akhilesh will not be able to go
 sapa ke liye priyanka jaisi bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai dimpaldimple ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ve samaajawaadee party ke liye puure pradesh main vahi kaam kar sakati hai jo raibareli or amethi main congress ke liye priyanka gandhi karti ai hai
 The special thing with Dimple is that he is not out of politics like Priyanka but is fully active in SP
 unhen chunaav ladane kaa bhi acha khaasaa anubhav hasil he or mahilaon se jude muddon par unhone kai baar apni baat saarvajanik rup se rakhi he
 priyanka-dimple's simultaneous rally could prove to be a game changer, if Akhilesh Yadav dominates the SP, his alliance with Congress is believed to be fixed
 congress lagaataar sanket de rahi he ki is baar chunaavon main priyanka kaa role pehle ke mukaable zyada vyapak hoga
 If this happens, Dimple and Priyanka can rally together
 donon kaa ek manch par jutana bheed jutaney ke lihaaj se itnaa mahatvapurn daanv hoga jisaki kaat khojna vipakshi bijepi or bispi ke liye khaasaa mushkil hoga
 Dimple's image will affect young, rural and female voters
 Dimple Yadav is a youth and she can help Akhilesh Yadav in communicating with young voters
 iske alaava mahilaon ke bich bhi ve khaasi lokapriy hai
 Last year, during the Women's Education and Protection Campaign program, she surrounded the government on the issue of women in the presence of Akhilesh Yadav on the stage
 mahilaon kii liye upi sarkaar kii help line 1090 ko bhi unhone kaaphi pramot kiya he
 Apart from this, the image of his Yadav family as daughter-in-law among the rural voters may also benefit Akhilesh Yadav in elections

 ' ufos and aliens are as big a puzzle for us and you, a bigger headache for China
 pichley hafte china ke ek airport ke paas uafo jaisi koi rahasyamay akruti dikhi
 Due to this, the airport remained closed for one hour
 isi tarah se july main bhi china ke ek airport ke paas uafo jaisi rahasyamay akruti dikhi thi
 The mysterious light first appeared near the Hangzhou Airport in China on July 7 and now on September 11, 40 kilometers east of Baotu Airport in Inner Mongolia province, and after that the airport had to be closed for an hour
 is baar to khatra or bada tha kyonki is baar us rahasyamay roshni se takkar kaa bhi khatra tha
 According to Luo, a Baotu Airport official, we received a notice about the UFO from the Hahot Air Traffic Management Bureau
 kisi haadase se bachane ke liye hamane turant hi duusare airport kii taraf vimaanon ko bhejnaa shuru kar diya
 If it did not, there could have been a big collision
 us raat ko sava nau baje ke kareeb beijing or shanghai se baotu pahunchane vaale teen vimaan kaaphi der tak aasmaan main hi chakkar lagaate rahe
 Eventually Air China Flight 1107 coming from Beijing to Baotu was airlifted to Erdos Airport, while the other aircraft to Juniyao at Taiyuan Airport
 us raat baotu airport par koi haadasa to nahin hua lekin us rahasyamay roshni ne kuch sawaal jarur khadey kar diye hai
 The first question arose whether he was a UFO in the skies of Inner Mongolia
 kya pichley nau maheene main uafo ne china or mongolia ke aasmaan main chakkar lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The second question arises that is there any new use of this Chinese army? aisa andaja lagaaya ja rahaa he ki chini fouj ne raat ke vakt aasmaan main koi prayog kiya hoga jiskaa nateeja uafo kii shakl main dikhaa
 The third question arises whether it is a technical mess or not
 ho saktaa he ki chini vaigyanikon ne rusi vaigyanikon kii tarj par aasmaan main challedaar roshni paidaa karne kii koshish kii ho
 According to reports, a similar experiment was conducted a few days ago by Russian Army engineers in the Norwegian skies and the US Army in Australia
 pichley dinon romania ke aasmaan main aisi hi rahasyamay roshni dikhi thi, jisaki padtaal karne ke baad vaigyanikon ne mana ki yah to der tak chalane vaali bijli kii chamak he
 Just like the hour-long flight of flights at China's Baotu Airport, a mysterious figure blocked the airport two months ago in the city of Hangzhou
 7 july kii raat 9 baje china ke purvi praant ke jhejiyang kii rajdhani hangajhau main log apane gharon kii ore laut rahe the ki unhen aasmaan main aisa kuch dikhaa jise dekhakar har koi hairaan rah gaya
 The movement of vehicles on the roads came to a standstill
 hangajhau shahar ke ziyaaoshaan airport par afratfari much gai
 Air traffic had to be stopped
 raat ke andhere main aasmaan main logon ne dekhi ek rahasyamayi or ajeebogareeb akruti jisase har kone se tej roshni baahar nikal rahi thi
 The shape of this figure was also quite large
 logon ne abhi tak jo kuch bhi kai baar hollywood filmon main dekha tha vah ab unki ankhon ke saamne maujuud tha
 However, there is no disclosure about this mysterious figure yet and now the mysterious figure has also been revealed near Baotu Airport in Inner Mongolia
 aise main uafo kaa rahasy or gaharaa gaya he
 When this mysterious figure appeared, Xiaoshan Airport was closed for an hour
 tab tak ke liye sari udaanon ko paas ke shahar ningbo or vuzi kii ore mode diya gaya
 ufos or mysterious figures appearing in China were rare
 lekin ek saal ke andar aisi teen ghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 That is why the buzz about these wonders whether it is a UFO or something else is not that there are reports of ufos and aliens only in China
 balki kuch samay pehle hi romania ke aasmaan main bhi badalon kaa ek rahasyamay challa dikhaa tha
 Then the people there were frightened by seeing that ring, but the scientists found that they are not creatures of any other planet, but a view of nature
 vakya oktober 2009 kaa he
 People were surprised by this amazing natural picture
 atakalbaziyaan tej ho gai
 The market for talks about ufos became so hot that people even started saying that people from other worlds have started preparing for an attack on the earth
 is akruti ko uski kaa saboot mana jane laga
 Seeing this shape, scientists had initially claimed that it is just a sample of changes in nature
 par logon ke bheetar baitha vaham unhen yah maanane nahin de rahaa tha
 However, in a few hours, the scientists were proved right
 kuch dinon kii shodh ke baad vaigyanikon ne saaf kar diya ki ye aasamaani challa kudarat kaa ek khel tha
 According to him, this shape of clouds is called Folstrike
 yah tabhi banataa he jab hawa main maujuud nami kaa taapmaana shunya se neeche jane ke baavzdu barf main nahin badal paata
 That extremely cold part of the moisture in the air turns into rings of clouds
 phir vah dharti kii sataha se kuch unchai par aakar thahar jaataa he
 Such a shape is most often formed when the sun is about to sink
 duniya kaa koi bhi aisa konaa nahin, jahaan alian or uafo kii rahasyamay kahani naa ho
 But this question has remained for years whether the aliens are really there
 vaise jane maane vaigyanik stephen hawking ne alian ke vajood kii baat kahkar is bahes ko or garma diya
 The speculation market is often hot on this question, but ufos are still a puzzle like ghosts
 jyadatar vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki brahmad main duusare grahon par jivan ho saktaa he
 But in the past, well-known British scientist Stephen Hawking surprised people by saying that the alien not only exists but they are more powerful than humans and can attack the earth
 lihaaja unase sampark karne kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 Even if Hawking's point is true, the question arises that why do the aliens come to the scene repeatedly? So far no scientist has the answer to these questions
 lekin alian or uafo ke rahasy ko sulajhane ke liye in sawaalon kaa jawaab jaruri he a gas explosion in a coal mine in China's Guizhou province killed 21 workers
 bachaav karmiyon ne bataaya ki anshun shahar main yuanyang coliyaari main guuruuvaar raat haadasa hua
 Then there were 31 laborers working there
 bachaavkarmiyon ne pushti kii ki 10 vyakti kisi tarah batch nikle
 Rescuers have found the bodies of 21 laborers
 samachar agency shinhua kii khabar ke anusaar, jahrili carbon monooxide ke visphot kii vajah se yah haadasa hua
 a rescue worker Zhao said, "we reached the mine for rescue work at midnight yesterday
 hamane teen logon ko baahar nikaala
 He said that five of the 10 surviving laborers are undergoing treatment in the hospital
 ye log jahrili carbon monoaksaide ke prabhaav main aa gaye hai
 Deputy Director of Coal Mine Safety Administration Wang Shuhe has rushed to the scene of the incident
 yuanyang coliyaari ek nijee khadaan he jiskaa haadase ke samay unnayan kiya ja rahaa tha
 Amid rising demand for coal in China, mine accidents occur and safety standards are neglected

 gambhir ne ardhashatak jadaa or antim khilaadi ke rup main out hue
 India won the toss and decided to bat first, but after Sehwag's dismissal, the decision looked wrong
 sahvaag ke out hone tak team ausatan 8 ran prati over bana rahi thi

 sahvaag ne 15 gendon main itane hi ran banaae

 ham sab media se ghire hue samaaj main rahete hai
 Along with all the issues in normal life, media is also an issue
 aap hi nahin, ham bhi is media ko samajhane kaa lagaataar prayaas karte rahete hai
 From nationalism to chemical fertilizer as well as media, there are debates in all the forums
 aapke liye bhi media ek mudda rahata he
 You are also an issue for the media
 media ke bare main aap jitani raay rakhte hai shaayad pehle utani nahin rakhte honge
 Concerns are being raised worldwide about the freedom of media, as well as the spread of media at the same pace
 tamaam maanakon ko dekhen to press kii swatantraaa kam ho rahi he, vahiin press kaa kaarobaar tezi se badhata hi ja rahaa he
 i do not understand how when the press is not free, the dominance of new media is increasing
 kya ham yaa aap media kii swatantraaa ko mahatv nahin dete hai
 The tweets on World Press Freedom Day are happening the same way as on Diwali and Ramnavami, that's why i celebrated this festival with you
 ham bharatiyon ke man main britain or amareeki media kii kitni gahari chhap he
 Apart from CNN and BBC, if the criticism of Prime Minister Modi is published in the New York Times, then opponents are hoping that they will lose the election
 taareef chap jaye to unke samarthak khush ho jate hai ki pradhanmantri kaa naam puri duniya main ho rahaa he
 Do you know what kind of debate is going on in the media in his own country
 neuyark times, washington post, sienon, bibisi, times, iconomist jaise sansthaanon vaale desh america or britain press kii swatantraaa ghati he
 In the report of Reporters Without Borders, America was ranked number 41 in 2016, which has now fallen by two points to 43 and Britain, which was at number 38 in 2016, has now fallen to number 40
 in mulkon main loktantr kii sansthaaen kaaphi majboot maani jaati he phir yahaan media kii swatantraaa kyon ghat rahi he
 The President of the United States openly greets the media of his country from the time of contesting elections
 baqayda gaali jaisi bhashaa dete hai
 Recently, when his government completed 100 days, Trump did not attend the dinner of reporters reporting to the White House
 aam taur par raashtrapati aise bhoj main jate hai
 Trump moved away from Washington to Pennsylvania and fiercely targeted the media among supporters there
 unhone kaha ki agar media kaa kaam eemaandaaree or sach dikhaanaa he to is paimaane par use zero milanaa chahie
 He has been calling the media fake news since the time of elections
 america main ab bhi itnaa bachaa hua he ki patrakaron ke bhoj main minhaz ne jamkar trump par chutki lee or kaha ki trump jhuuthon ke sartaaj hai
 Minhaz saheb has now called the president the lire in chief, the king of lies
 hamaare yahaan to bharat vyas ji ne 1957 main do ankhe baarah haath ke liye gaanaa likhaa tha jo bada mashhoor hua tha
 Saina turned out to be a legend of lies
 har mulk main press or president yaa press or pradhanmantri ke bich sangharsh chhidaa hua he
 The President of Turkey came to India and sent a message to the students not to trust the Western media
 wo sach nahin dikhaata he
 You watch turkey channels
 reporters vidaud borders ne turki main press kii swatantraaa ke bare main jo tippanee kii he wo shaayad jamiya ke sabhaagaar main sun rahe chaatro ko pataa nahin hoga
 Its report has raised the most concern about turkey
 180 deshon main turki kaa sthaan 155 waan he
 Has dropped four points compared to 2016
 12 saal main yah 57 ank neeche gira he
 There were coup attempts in July 2016
 uske baad to sarkaar ne press ke khilaaf morcha hi khol diya
 Many media institutions were banned
 bina trial ke 100 se adhik patrakaron ko jail bhej diya gaya
 There is no good news about media from anywhere
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he, kya janata ko swatantra media nahin chahie, kya swatantra media kii chaah sirf kuch logon tak hi simit he
 The media business is growing very fast
 duniya main bhi or bharat main bhi
 But have your living conditions been better than before, do you think that accountability has come in politics, or everything is just perception, it is going on as it was
 logon kaa bharosa isi media par kyon he jisaki swatantraaa, nishpakshta ko lekar duniya bhar main sawaal uth rahe hai
 In the midst of all these ups and downs, Pakistan gained 8 points better than in 2016
 2016 main pakistan 147ve number par tha, lekin 2017 main 139 wein number par aa gaya
 India was ranked 133 in 2016, falling three points to 136 in 2017
 reporters vidout borders, jisane duniya main press kii swatantraaa ke suchakank taiyaar kiye hai, unki report main kuch tippaniyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 Christophe Deloire, the secretary general of this institution, says that the rate at which the restrictions are increasing in democracies is a matter of great concern and that no other freedom can be guaranteed if media freedom is not protected
 ye downward spiral, hamen kahaan le jayega? yani ham girte girte kahaan pahunchane vaale hai
 Wherever the authoritarian strongman model has won, the freedom of media has decreased
 aisi jagahon par public radio or tivi stesan propaganda ke auzaar ban gaye hai
 Such as Poland, Hungary, Tanzania, etc
 turki (155) main rajab taiyab ardogaan sarkaar ke kilaaf naakaam baghawat ke baad se wo desh duniya main media profeshnals ke liye sabase badi jail sa ban gaya he
 There is a monopolistic, autocratic government in power
 putin kaa rus (148) bhi in halaat se bahut dur nahin he
 We asked for their opinion from some journalists in India
 unase poocha ki kya ve maanate hai ki bharat main press azaad he
 Do they think that after coming into journalism, they are doing the same work for which they had come, now do they think more seriously than before that if they had the chance, they would have left this medium
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar press bheed kii bhashaa bolne lage, sarkaar kii bhashaa bolne lage to aapkaa kya nuksaan hoga
 If you try, you will understand very easily
 bharat main ek kaam bahut chaalaaki se ho rahaa he
 Journalism is hiding its glory under the guise of nationalism
 patrkaar kaa kaam sawaal karnaa he to aaj kal aap dekhenge ki sawaal karne waalon kaa kis tarah se mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 The freedom of media is essential for democracy as much as the presence of opposition
 bharat kii patrakarita main aae din vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 Their siege is taking place as if they are not in opposition, but in government
 vipaksh ke khilaaf press atirikt rup se hamalavar ho gaya he
 You can also notice all this yourself
 raashtrapati obama ne jab apana pad choda tha tab press ke liye ek baat kahi thi, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
 "meaning the work of a journalist is not to be a spoon, his job is to question
 ye us desh ke raashtrapati kaa kahana he jis desh main first amendament ke tahat press kaa kaaphi adhikaar mila hua he
 Obama held 165 press conferences during his eight-year term
 har saal ve 20 press conference karte the
 Do you know about any President or Prime Minister or any Chief Minister in India who holds 20 press conferences in a year, where questions are answered openly
 mujhe to dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he
 President Trump mocks the press
 unke bich jane kii bajaae apane samarthakon ke bich jaakar press par hamalaa bolte hai
 In this way, people are also pitted against the press
 yahi ho rahaa he
 Powerful leaders around the world are cleverly inciting people against the press
 hamaare yahaan to ab dost yaar bhi salaah dete hai ki chodo patrakarita kii chintaa, zyaada kisi se mat bhido
 The country will go on
 lekin america ke patrakaron ne milakar raashtrapati trump ko ek lanbaa khat likhaa
 We also discussed this in prime time
 tab bhi kaha tha ki agar is patr ko hindi, bangla or marathi se lekar tamil, telugu ke akhbaar pehle panne par chhap den to patrakaron se pehle pathakon main badlaav aa jayega
 They will begin to look at the work of the press with a sharp eye
 american press kor america ke patrakaron kaa ek bada sanghathan he jiskaa centre neuyark ke colombia university ke andar he
 There are journalists of all types of news organizations and ideologies
 aadarneey niwarchit raashtrapati ji, In the last days of the beginning of your term, we have just made it clear that we look at the relationship between your administration and the American press
 ham maanate hai ki donon ke rishton main tanaav he
 The report states that your press secretary is looking at shutting down media offices from the White House
 aapane khud ko cover karne se kai news sanghathanon ko bain kiya he
 You have taunted and threatened journalists with names on Twitter
 apane samarthakon ko bhi aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 You have mocked a reporter saying that he did not like his words because he is disabled
 apane prashasan tak reporter kii pahunch samaapt kar galati karenge
 We specialize in finding various avenues to acquire information
 aapane apane abhiyaan ke dauraan jin news sanghathano ko bain kiya tha unki kai report behtareen rahi he
 We accept this challenge
 patrakarita ke niyam hamaare hai, aapke nahin hai
 Whether we talk to your officials of record or not
 ham chahen to aaf ricard brifing main aayen na aayen
 If you think that you will not get a story by silencing or banning the reporter, then it is wrong
 ham aapkaa paksh lene kaa prayaas karenge
 But we will not give place to those who twist the truth
 ve jab bhi aisa karenge ham unhen bhaga denge
 This is our right
 ham aapke jhooth ko nahin doharaayenge
 Will print your point but will know the truth
 aap or aapkaa staff white house main baitha rahe, lekin amareeki sarkaar kaaphi faili hui he
 We will deploy our reporters around the government
 aapaki agenciyon main ghusaa denge or naukarshahon se khabaren nikaal laayenge
 You may stop the news coming from your administrative building, but we will review and show your policies
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany
 yahaan se ek akhbaar nikalataa he jiskaa naam he jud doyche tcitung
 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year
 is samooh main bharat kii taraf se indian express bhi shaamil he jisaki website or akhbaar main panama papers ko kaaphi vistaar se chapa gaya he
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 aparaadh, bhrashtachar ab ek desh kii seemaa tak simit nahin he,kai deshon kaa maamla ho jaataa he isliye yah zaruri he ki kai deshon ke patrkaar milakar kaam karen
 There are many types of experienced people working in ICIJ especially those who are skilled in reading government records
 tathyon kii jaanch karne vaale or vakil bhi hote hai
 Many journalists are doing this at their level in India
 kai website hai jo patrakarita kaa vikalp ban rahi hai magar unki pahunch utani nahin he jitani media kii he yaa jitani raajnneetik dalon ke niyantran vaali soshal media kii he
 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated
 boomlive
 in is one such platform
 boomlive
 in An independent digital journalism initiative
 ye website ek fact checking website he jo apane pathakon ko vichaaron kii jagah pramanit tathy detii he
 The website checks the facts whenever there is a claim
 website un logon par bhi story karti he jo vyaktigat adhikaron, bolne kii azaadi ko lekar sangharsh kar rahe hote hai
 You should also visit hoot
org to understand about media
 yahaan par aapako media kii naitikta, press kii azaadi ko lekar kai achche lekh milenge
 This will go a long way in understanding the media
 hoot khabaron kii sateekta, santulan, jaankaree, sensorship or zimmedaari jaise pahaluon kii padtaal karti he
 mediavigil is one such Hindi website which has the tagline Comment is free but facts are sacred
 yani aap jo chahen tippanee karen, lekin jo tathy he wo to sahi rahe
 Do not tamper with it
 tippaniyan Removing the news is not easy
 patrakaron ne to behad main jaakar daakuon kaa bhi intervyuu kiya, mafia or sarganaon kaa bhi
 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 reporters vidout borders kii reating main america 2016 main 41wein number par tha jo ab do ank girakar 43 par aa gaya or britain jo 2016 main 38wein number par tha ab girakar 40wein number par aa gaya he
 In these countries, the institutions of democracy are considered very strong, then why the freedom of media is declining here
 america ke raashtrapati to chunaav ladane ke samay se apane mulk kii media ko khulkar gariyaate hai
 They give language like abuse
 haal hi main jab unki sarkaar ne 100 din puure kiye to trump white house kii reporting karne vaale samvaadadaataaon ke raatri bhoj main nahin gaye
 Usually the President goes to such a feast
 trump washington se dur pencilvenia chale gaye or vahaan samarthakon ke bich media ko jamkar nishaanaa banaaya
 He said that if media work is to show honesty and truth, then on this scale it should get zero
 ve chunaav ke samay se hi media ko phek news kehete rahe hai
 There is still so much left in America that Minhaz fiercely quipped at the trump at the journalists' banquet and said that the trump is the master of lies
 minhaz sahab ne to ab raashtrapati ko lair in chif yani jhuuthon kaa sartaaj kaha he
 In our place, Bharat Vyas ji wrote a song in 1957 for Two Eyes Twelve Hands which became very famous
 sainyaa jhuuthon kaa bada sartaaj niklaa
 In every country there is a conflict between the press and the president or between the press and the prime minister
 turki ke raashtrapati bharat aae the or yahaan chaatro ko sandesh dekar gaye ki pashchimi media par bharosa na karen
 He does not show the truth
 aap turki ke channel dekhiye
 The comments Vidour Borders has made about the freedom of the press in Turkey may not be known to the students listening in Jamia's auditorium
 isaki report main turki ko lekar sabase adhik chintaa jataai gai he
 Turkey ranks 155th out of 180 countries
 2016 kii tulana main chaar ank neeche gira he
 It has dropped 57 points in 12 years
 july 2016 main vahaan takhtapalat kii koshishen huin thim
 After that, the government only opened a front against the press
 kai media sansthaanon par pratibandh laga diye gaye
 More than 100 journalists were sent to jail without trial
 kahin se bhi media ko lekar acchhee khabar nahin he
 Why is this happening, does the public not want independent media, is the desire for independent media limited to only a few people
 media kaa kaarobaar kaaphi tezi se bad rahaa he
 In the world as well as in India
 lekin kya aapke jeene kii paristhitiyaan pehle se behatar hui hai, kya aapako lagata he ki raajnneeti main javabdehi aa gai he, yaa sabakuch dharna hi he, jaisaa chal rahaa tha vaisaa hi chal rahaa he
 Why do people trust this media, whose freedom, fairness are being questioned all over the world
 in sab utaar-chadhaav ke bich pakistan 2016 kii tulana main 8 ank behatar ho gaya
 In 2016, Pakistan was ranked 147, but in 2017, it was ranked at 139
 2016 main bharat 133 number par tha jo teen ank girakar 2017 main 136 par aa gaya
 Some comments can be seen in the report by Reporters Without Borders, which has produced indexes of press freedom in the world
 is sanstha ke secretary general Christophe Deloire kaa kahana he ki loktantron main jis dar se pratibandh badhate ja rahe hai wo kaafii chintaa kii baat he or agar media kii azaadi surakshit nahin he to kisi duusari azaadi kii guarantee nahin di ja sakati
 Where will this downward spiral take us? That is, where are we going to reach by falling
 jahaan bhi authoritarian strongman model kii jeet hui he, vahaan media kii azaadi ghati he
 Public radio and TV stations have become propaganda tools in such places
 jaise poland, hungary, tanzania vagairah
 The country has become the largest prison for media professionals in the world since the failed rebellion against the Rajab Tayyib Ardogan government in Turkey (155)
 vahaan ek ekadhikaaravaadi, swechhachari sarkaar satta main he
 Putin's Russia (148) is also not far from these situations
 hamane bharat ke kuch patrakaron se unki raay mangai
 Asked him if he believed that the press in India was free
 kya unhen lagata he ki patrakarita main aane ke baad vahi kaam kar rahe hai jiske liye aae the, kya ab ve pehle se zyaada gambhirtha se sochate hai ki mauka miltaa to is madhyam ko chhod dete
 Have you ever thought that if the press starts speaking the language of the crowd, the language of the government then what will be your loss
 aap koshish karenge to bahut aasaani se samaj aa jayega
 a work is being done very cleverly in India
 rashtrawaad kii aad main patrakarita apni chamachagiri chipa rahi he
 If the work of a journalist is to question, then tomorrow you will see how those who question are mocked
 loktantr ke liye jitna media kii swatantraaa zaruri he utana hi vipaksh kii maujuudagi bhi
 Opposition is ridiculed on the day of India's journalism
 unki gheraabandi is tarah se ho rahi he jaise wo vipaksh main nahin, sarkaar main ho
 The press has additionally become aggressive against the opposition
 ye sab aap khud bhi notice kar sakate hai
 President Obama said one thing to the press when he left his post, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
" " matlab patrkaar kaa kaam chamachaa hona nahin he, uskaa kaam sawaal karnaa he
 This is said by the President of the country in which the country has got a lot of press rights under the First Amendment
 obama ne aath saal ke kaarykaal main 165 press conference kii thi
 Every year he held 20 press conferences
 kya bharat main kisi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri yaa kisi mukhyamantri ke bare main aap jaanate hai jo saal main 20 press conference karte hon, jahaan khulkar sawaal jawaab hote hon
 i am not paying attention
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists
 wo press ke kaam ko paini nazar se dekhne lagenge
 The American Press Corps is a large organization of American journalists whose center is located in New York's Columbia University
 har tarah ke news sanghathan or vichaardhaara ke patrkaar hai
 Respected elected President, aapke kaarykaal ke shuru hone ke antim dinon main hamane abhi hi saaf kar dena sahi samajha ki ham aapke prashasan or amareeki press ke rishton ko kaise dekhte hai
 We believe that there is tension in their relationship
 report bataati he ki aapke press sachiv white house se media ke daftaron ko band karne kii soch rahe hai
 You have banned many news organizations from covering themselves
 aapane twitor par naam lekar patrakaron par taane kase hai, dhamkaaya he
 Has asked his supporters to do the same
 aapane ek reporter kaa yah kahkar mazaaq udaaya he ki uski baaten isliye acchhee nahin lagi ki vah viklang he
 They will make a mistake by ending the reporter's access to their administration
 ham soochna hasil karne ke tarah tarah ke raste khojane main maahir hai
 Many of the news organizations that you banned during your campaign have been excellent
 ham is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 Journalism rules are ours, not yours
 ham chaahe to aapke adhikariyon se aaf ricard baat karen yaa na karen
 If we wish, do not attend the record briefing
 agar aap yah sochate hai ki reporter ko chup kara dene yaa bhaga dene se story nahin milegi to galat hai
 We will try to take your side
 lekin ham sachai ko todane marodane waalon ko jagah nahin denge
 Whenever they do this, we will drive them away
 yah hamaara adhikaar he
 We will not repeat your lie
 aapaki baat chhaapenge lekin sachai kaa pataa karenge
 You and your staff sit in the White House, but the US government is quite wide
 ham sarkaar ke chaaron taraf apane reporter tainaat kar denge
 They will get into your agencies and bring news from bureaucrats
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane prashasnic imaarat se aane vaali khabaron ko roak len lekin ham aapaki nitiyon kii samiksha karke dikhaa denge
 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge
 They will feel that supporting their leader means opposing the media questioning him
 is chakkar main nuksaan kiskaa hota he
 Belongs to you
 america ke patrakaron ne to trump kii chunauti sweekaar kii, lekin uske bahut pehle se duniya bhar ke patrkaar ghotalebaz or jhuthe netaaon ke peeche pade hai
 Remind you of the Panama Papers that were continuously raided by the Indian Express for several days
 germany ke dakshini hisse main ek shahar he munich
 From here comes a newspaper called Jude Daeche Tsiteung
 german main jud kaa matlab hota he dakshin, doyche matlab germany or tcitung matlab akhbaar
 South Germany has a large newspaper of circulation whose circulation is 4 lakh 32 thousand

 It was not easy to read millions of company and millions of documents
 wo bhi tab jab inaki jaanch ke liye duniya ke kai deshon main padtaal zaruri thi
 Therefore, the Jude Deutsche Tsiteung newspaper shared these documents with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar ek saal tak in dastavezon kii jaanch karte rahe
 The group also includes Indian Express from India whose Panama Papers have been printed in great detail in its website and newspaper
 ICIJ 76 deshon ke duniya bhar ke 109 sansthaanon ke khoji patrakaron kaa ek samooh he
 Crime, corruption is no longer confined to the border of one country, becomes the case of many countries, so it is important that journalists of many countries work together
 ICIJ main kai prakaar ke anbhavi log kaam karte hai khaskar ve log jo sarkari ricard ko padhane main daksh hote hai
 There are also fact checkers and lawyers
 bharat main aisa kai patrkaar apane str par kar rahe hai
 There are many websites that are becoming an alternative to journalism but they do not have as much reach as the media or social media controlled by political parties
 phek news ek chunauti to he hi
 Journalists are also presenting fake news and governments are also throwing news
 phek news matlab news ke naam par nakli news
 As soon as elections begin in India, the Election Commission starts to face the challenge of paid news
 paisa dekar yaa kisi or tareeke se vigyaapan dekar raajnneetik dalon ke haq main lahar paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Paid news is now a chronic problem
 ek or news he slo news
 The concept has been given by the BBC Director General Tony Hall
 tony haul kaa maananaa he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news
 bibisi ne is chunauti ko abhiyaan ke taur par sweekaar kiya he
 Facebook has also announced to form a team to investigate fake news
 bibisi kii yah baat dilachasp he ki hamen slo news kii zarurat he
 Which has depth, data, search, analysis and expertise
 jis din pakistan ne bhartiya sainikon ke saath barbarta kii us din ek channel or ek akhbaar ne ek khabar chhaapi ki bharat ne javaabi karrwai karte hue das pakistan sainikon ke sar kaat liye hai
 One channel said that seven Pakistanis have been beheaded
 ye khabaren chhapi or logon tak pahunch bhi gayi
 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place
 sena ke maamle main saat or das sar kii kahani kya banaai gai yaa kisi ne galat brif kiya
 Editorial mistakes are made, there is a mistake in printing, but this news was from the front page
 saaf saaf likhaa tha ki bharat ne do ke badale das paak sainik maar giraae
 a mistake also occurred to me in Tuesday's prime time
 us galati main do galati hui
 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972
 yah soochna aar tii ai se mili he
 When the Railways investigated, it was found that the officials gave incorrect information in RTI
 in adhikariyon ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 We showed this news but till then i did not know about the railway's response
 phir ye galati he
 Railway officials gave wrong information to RTI, it appeared in RTI newspapers and from there in prime time
 hamane duusari galati ye ki 972 rupee ko 9,720 rupee likh diya
 i have no hesitation in apologizing for such a mistake
 lekin ye phek news nahin he
 Fake news is that which is being circulated among you in many ways these days

 The comments khabaren nikaalnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 Journalists went to the rugged and interviewed the dacoits as well as the mafia and gangsters
 khabaron ko nikaalane main patrkaar kai tarah ke jokhim uthaate hai
 Governments have started curbing journalists in the name of terrorism
 britain main ek kanoon paas hua he the Investigative Powers Act, ise snupar charter bhi kehete hai
 Under this, the journalist can be imprisoned for 14 years on charges of espionage
 aap apane sorce se kya baat karte hai wo bataanaa hoga or gupt soochna li karne ke aarope main jail ja sakate hai
 This means that you will not know what happens in the basement of power
 bharat main bhi patrakaron par is tarah ke mukademe ho rahe hai
 i narrate an anecdote from Pakistan
 pakistan ke don akhbaar ke patrkaar siril alamida ne is saal 9 janvari ko ek khabar brake kii jisamen kaha gaya ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne apane faujee netritv ko saafe kah diya he ki agar aatankwaad ke kilaaf thos karrwai nahin kii gai to pakistan ke antarrashtriya birdari main alag thalag padane kaa khatara he
 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is
 di hoot ne press swatantraaa diwas par ek report jari kii he jiske anusaar janvari 16 se april 17 ke bich patrakaron par 52 jaanaleva hamale hue hai
 According to the Home Ministry report, there have been 142 attacks between 2014-15
 bastar jaisi jagah se report karnaa aasaan nahin
 Journalist gets caught between police and Naxalites
 is jang ke bich patrkaar ke saamne chunauti hoti he ki wo adivaasiyon ke saath ho rahe zulm kii khabar bhi report kare
 But he also comes under target of security agencies
 pichley do saal main bastar main aise kai patrakaron ko jail bheja gaya jo aisi hi kahaniyaan baahar laa rahe the
 There is no good news about media from anywhere
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he, kya janata ko swatantra media nahin chahie, kya swatantra media kii chaah sirf kuch logon tak hi simit he
 The media business is growing very fast
 duniya main bhi or bharat main bhi
 But have your living conditions been better than before, do you think that accountability has come in politics, or everything is just perception, it is going on as it was
 logon kaa bharosa isi media par kyon he jisaki swatantraaa, nishpakshta ko lekar duniya bhar main sawaal uth rahe hai
 In the midst of all these ups and downs, Pakistan gained 8 points better than in 2016
 2016 main pakistan 147ve number par tha, lekin 2017 main 139 wein number par aa gaya
 India was ranked 133 in 2016, falling three points to 136 in 2017
 reporters vidout borders, jisane duniya main press kii swatantraaa ke suchakank taiyaar kiye hai, unki report main kuch tippaniyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 Christophe Deloire, the secretary general of this institution, says that the rate at which the restrictions are increasing in democracies is a matter of great concern and that no other freedom can be guaranteed if media freedom is not protected
 ye downward spiral, hamen kahaan le jayega? yani ham girte girte kahaan pahunchane vaale hai
 Wherever the authoritarian strongman model has won, the freedom of media has decreased
 aisi jagahon par public radio or tivi stesan propaganda ke auzaar ban gaye hai
 Such as Poland, Hungary, Tanzania, etc
 turki (155) main rajab taiyab ardogaan sarkaar ke kilaaf naakaam baghawat ke baad se wo desh duniya main media profeshnals ke liye sabase badi jail sa ban gaya he
 There is a monopolistic, autocratic government in power
 putin kaa rus (148) bhi in halaat se bahut dur nahin he
 We asked for their opinion from some journalists in India
 unase poocha ki kya ve maanate hai ki bharat main press azaad he
 Do they think that after coming into journalism, they are doing the same work for which they had come, now do they think more seriously than before that if they had the chance, they would have left this medium
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar press bheed kii bhashaa bolne lage, sarkaar kii bhashaa bolne lage to aapkaa kya nuksaan hoga
 If you try, you will understand very easily
 bharat main ek kaam bahut chaalaaki se ho rahaa he
 Journalism is hiding its glory under the guise of nationalism
 patrkaar kaa kaam sawaal karnaa he to aaj kal aap dekhenge ki sawaal karne waalon kaa kis tarah se mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 The freedom of media is essential for democracy as much as the presence of opposition
 bharat kii patrakarita main aae din vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 Their siege is taking place as if they are not in opposition, but in government
 vipaksh ke khilaaf press atirikt rup se hamalavar ho gaya he
 You can also notice all this yourself
 raashtrapati obama ne jab apana pad choda tha tab press ke liye ek baat kahi thi, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
 "meaning the work of a journalist is not to be a spoon, his job is to question
 ye us desh ke raashtrapati kaa kahana he jis desh main first amendament ke tahat press kaa kaaphi adhikaar mila hua he
 Obama held 165 press conferences during his eight-year term
 har saal ve 20 press conference karte the
 Do you know about any President or Prime Minister or any Chief Minister in India who holds 20 press conferences in a year, where questions are answered openly
 mujhe to dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he
 President Trump mocks the press
 unke bich jane kii bajaae apane samarthakon ke bich jaakar press par hamalaa bolte hai
 In this way, people are also pitted against the press
 yahi ho rahaa he
 Powerful leaders around the world are cleverly inciting people against the press
 hamaare yahaan to ab dost yaar bhi salaah dete hai ki chodo patrakarita kii chintaa, zyaada kisi se mat bhido
 The country will go on
 lekin america ke patrakaron ne milakar raashtrapati trump ko ek lanbaa khat likhaa
 We also discussed this in prime time
 tab bhi kaha tha ki agar is patr ko hindi, bangla or marathi se lekar tamil, telugu ke akhbaar pehle panne par chhap den to patrakaron se pehle pathakon main badlaav aa jayega
 They will begin to look at the work of the press with a sharp eye
 american press kor america ke patrakaron kaa ek bada sanghathan he jiskaa centre neuyark ke colombia university ke andar he
 There are journalists of all types of news organizations and ideologies
 aadarneey niwarchit raashtrapati ji, In the last days of the beginning of your term, we have just made it clear that we look at the relationship between your administration and the American press
 ham maanate hai ki donon ke rishton main tanaav he
 The report states that your press secretary is looking at shutting down media offices from the White House
 aapane khud ko cover karne se kai news sanghathanon ko bain kiya he
 You have taunted and threatened journalists with names on Twitter
 apane samarthakon ko bhi aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 You have mocked a reporter saying that he did not like his words because he is disabled
 apane prashasan tak reporter kii pahunch samaapt kar galati karenge
 We specialize in finding various avenues to acquire information
 aapane apane abhiyaan ke dauraan jin news sanghathano ko bain kiya tha unki kai report behtareen rahi he
 We accept this challenge
 patrakarita ke niyam hamaare hai, aapke nahin hai
 Whether we talk to your officials of record or not
 ham chahen to aaf ricard brifing main aayen na aayen
 If you think that you will not get a story by silencing or banning the reporter, then it is wrong
 ham aapkaa paksh lene kaa prayaas karenge
 But we will not give place to those who twist the truth
 ve jab bhi aisa karenge ham unhen bhaga denge
 This is our right
 ham aapke jhooth ko nahin doharaayenge
 Will print your point but will know the truth
 aap or aapkaa staff white house main baitha rahe, lekin amareeki sarkaar kaaphi faili hui he
 We will deploy our reporters around the government
 aapaki agenciyon main ghusaa denge or naukarshahon se khabaren nikaal laayenge
 You may stop the news coming from your administrative building, but we will review and show your policies
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany
 yahaan se ek akhbaar nikalataa he jiskaa naam he jud doyche tcitung
 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year
 is samooh main bharat kii taraf se indian express bhi shaamil he jisaki website or akhbaar main panama papers ko kaaphi vistaar se chapa gaya he
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 aparaadh, bhrashtachar ab ek desh kii seemaa tak simit nahin he,kai deshon kaa maamla ho jaataa he isliye yah zaruri he ki kai deshon ke patrkaar milakar kaam karen
 There are many types of experienced people working in ICIJ especially those who are skilled in reading government records
 tathyon kii jaanch karne vaale or vakil bhi hote hai
 Many journalists are doing this at their level in India
 kai website hai jo patrakarita kaa vikalp ban rahi hai magar unki pahunch utani nahin he jitani media kii he yaa jitani raajnneetik dalon ke niyantran vaali soshal media kii he
 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated

 Do not tamper with it
 tippaniyan Removing the news is not easy
 patrakaron ne to behad main jaakar daakuon kaa bhi intervyuu kiya, mafia or sarganaon kaa bhi
 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17 
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 reporters vidout borders, jisane duniya main press kii swatantraaa ke suchakank taiyaar kiye hai, unki report main kuch tippaniyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 Christophe Deloire, the secretary general of this institution, says that the rate at which the restrictions are increasing in democracies is a matter of great concern and that no other freedom can be guaranteed if media freedom is not protected
 ye downward spiral, hamen kahaan le jayega? yani ham girte girte kahaan pahunchane vaale hai
 Wherever the authoritarian strongman model has won, the freedom of media has decreased
 aisi jagahon par public radio or tivi stesan propaganda ke auzaar ban gaye hai
 Such as Poland, Hungary, Tanzania, etc
 turki (155) main rajab taiyab ardogaan sarkaar ke kilaaf naakaam baghawat ke baad se wo desh duniya main media profeshnals ke liye sabase badi jail sa ban gaya he
 There is a monopolistic, autocratic government in power
 putin kaa rus (148) bhi in halaat se bahut dur nahin he
 We asked for their opinion from some journalists in India
 unase poocha ki kya ve maanate hai ki bharat main press azaad he
 Do they think that after coming into journalism, they are doing the same work for which they had come, now do they think more seriously than before that if they had the chance, they would have left this medium
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar press bheed kii bhashaa bolne lage, sarkaar kii bhashaa bolne lage to aapkaa kya nuksaan hoga
 If you try, you will understand very easily
 bharat main ek kaam bahut chaalaaki se ho rahaa he
 Journalism is hiding its glory under the guise of nationalism
 patrkaar kaa kaam sawaal karnaa he to aaj kal aap dekhenge ki sawaal karne waalon kaa kis tarah se mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 The freedom of media is essential for democracy as much as the presence of opposition
 bharat kii patrakarita main aae din vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 Their siege is taking place as if they are not in opposition, but in government
 vipaksh ke khilaaf press atirikt rup se hamalavar ho gaya he
 You can also notice all this yourself
 raashtrapati obama ne jab apana pad choda tha tab press ke liye ek baat kahi thi, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
 "meaning the work of a journalist is not to be a spoon, his job is to question
 ye us desh ke raashtrapati kaa kahana he jis desh main first amendament ke tahat press kaa kaaphi adhikaar mila hua he
 Obama held 165 press conferences during his eight-year term
 har saal ve 20 press conference karte the
 Do you know about any President or Prime Minister or any Chief Minister in India who holds 20 press conferences in a year, where questions are answered openly
 mujhe to dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he
 President Trump mocks the press
 unke bich jane kii bajaae apane samarthakon ke bich jaakar press par hamalaa bolte hai
 In this way, people are also pitted against the press
 yahi ho rahaa he
 Powerful leaders around the world are cleverly inciting people against the press
 hamaare yahaan to ab dost yaar bhi salaah dete hai ki chodo patrakarita kii chintaa, zyaada kisi se mat bhido
 The country will go on
 lekin america ke patrakaron ne milakar raashtrapati trump ko ek lanbaa khat likhaa
 We also discussed this in prime time
 tab bhi kaha tha ki agar is patr ko hindi, bangla or marathi se lekar tamil, telugu ke akhbaar pehle panne par chhap den to patrakaron se pehle pathakon main badlaav aa jayega
 They will begin to look at the work of the press with a sharp eye
 american press kor america ke patrakaron kaa ek bada sanghathan he jiskaa centre neuyark ke colombia university ke andar he
 There are journalists of all types of news organizations and ideologies
 aadarneey niwarchit raashtrapati ji, In the last days of the beginning of your term, we have just made it clear that we look at the relationship between your administration and the American press
 ham maanate hai ki donon ke rishton main tanaav he
 The report states that your press secretary is looking at shutting down media offices from the White House
 aapane khud ko cover karne se kai news sanghathanon ko bain kiya he
 You have taunted and threatened journalists with names on Twitter
 apane samarthakon ko bhi aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 You have mocked a reporter saying that he did not like his words because he is disabled
 apane prashasan tak reporter kii pahunch samaapt kar galati karenge
 We specialize in finding various avenues to acquire information
 aapane apane abhiyaan ke dauraan jin news sanghathano ko bain kiya tha unki kai report behtareen rahi he
 We accept this challenge
 patrakarita ke niyam hamaare hai, aapke nahin hai
 Whether we talk to your officials of record or not
 ham chahen to aaf ricard brifing main aayen na aayen
 If you think that you will not get a story by silencing or banning the reporter, then it is wrong
 ham aapkaa paksh lene kaa prayaas karenge
 But we will not give place to those who twist the truth
 ve jab bhi aisa karenge ham unhen bhaga denge
 This is our right
 ham aapke jhooth ko nahin doharaayenge
 Will print your point but will know the truth
 aap or aapkaa staff white house main baitha rahe, lekin amareeki sarkaar kaaphi faili hui he
 We will deploy our reporters around the government
 aapaki agenciyon main ghusaa denge or naukarshahon se khabaren nikaal laayenge
 You may stop the news coming from your administrative building, but we will review and show your policies
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany
 yahaan se ek akhbaar nikalataa he jiskaa naam he jud doyche tcitung
 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year
 is samooh main bharat kii taraf se indian express bhi shaamil he jisaki website or akhbaar main panama papers ko kaaphi vistaar se chapa gaya he
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 aparaadh, bhrashtachar ab ek desh kii seemaa tak simit nahin he,kai deshon kaa maamla ho jaataa he isliye yah zaruri he ki kai deshon ke patrkaar milakar kaam karen
 There are many types of experienced people working in ICIJ especially those who are skilled in reading government records
 tathyon kii jaanch karne vaale or vakil bhi hote hai
 Many journalists are doing this at their level in India
 kai website hai jo patrakarita kaa vikalp ban rahi hai magar unki pahunch utani nahin he jitani media kii he yaa jitani raajnneetik dalon ke niyantran vaali soshal media kii he
 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated
 boomlive

 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he

 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 hamane bharat ke kuch patrakaron se unki raay mangai
 Asked him if he believed that the press in India was free
 kya unhen lagata he ki patrakarita main aane ke baad vahi kaam kar rahe hai jiske liye aae the, kya ab ve pehle se zyaada gambhirtha se sochate hai ki mauka miltaa to is madhyam ko chhod dete
 Have you ever thought that if the press starts speaking the language of the crowd, the language of the government then what will be your loss
 aap koshish karenge to bahut aasaani se samaj aa jayega
 a work is being done very cleverly in India
 rashtrawaad kii aad main patrakarita apni chamachagiri chipa rahi he
 If the work of a journalist is to question, then tomorrow you will see how those who question are mocked
 loktantr ke liye jitna media kii swatantraaa zaruri he utana hi vipaksh kii maujuudagi bhi
 Opposition is ridiculed on the day of India's journalism
 unki gheraabandi is tarah se ho rahi he jaise wo vipaksh main nahin, sarkaar main ho
 The press has additionally become aggressive against the opposition
 ye sab aap khud bhi notice kar sakate hai
 President Obama said one thing to the press when he left his post, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
" " matlab patrkaar kaa kaam chamachaa hona nahin he, uskaa kaam sawaal karnaa he
 This is said by the President of the country in which the country has got a lot of press rights under the First Amendment
 obama ne aath saal ke kaarykaal main 165 press conference kii thi
 Every year he held 20 press conferences
 kya bharat main kisi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri yaa kisi mukhyamantri ke bare main aap jaanate hai jo saal main 20 press conference karte hon, jahaan khulkar sawaal jawaab hote hon
 i am not paying attention
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists
 wo press ke kaam ko paini nazar se dekhne lagenge
 The American Press Corps is a large organization of American journalists whose center is located in New York's Columbia University

 Respected elected President, aapke kaarykaal ke shuru hone ke antim dinon main hamane abhi hi saaf kar dena sahi samajha ki ham aapke prashasan or amareeki press ke rishton ko kaise dekhte hai
 We believe that there is tension in their relationship

 You have banned many news organizations from covering themselves

 Has asked his supporters to do the same
 aapane ek reporter kaa yah kahkar mazaaq udaaya he ki uski baaten isliye acchhee nahin lagi ki vah viklang he
 They will make a mistake by ending the reporter's access to their administration
 ham soochna hasil karne ke tarah tarah ke raste khojane main maahir hai
 Many of the news organizations that you banned during your campaign have been excellent
 ham is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 Journalism rules are ours, not yours
 ham chaahe to aapke adhikariyon se aaf ricard baat karen yaa na karen
 If we wish, do not attend the record briefing
 agar aap yah sochate hai ki reporter ko chup kara dene yaa bhaga dene se story nahin milegi to galat hai
 We will try to take your side
 lekin ham sachai ko todane marodane waalon ko jagah nahin denge
 Whenever they do this, we will drive them away
 yah hamaara adhikaar he
 We will not repeat your lie
 aapaki baat chhaapenge lekin sachai kaa pataa karenge
 You and your staff sit in the White House, but the US government is quite wide
 ham sarkaar ke chaaron taraf apane reporter tainaat kar denge
 They will get into your agencies and bring news from bureaucrats
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane prashasnic imaarat se aane vaali khabaron ko roak len lekin ham aapaki nitiyon kii samiksha karke dikhaa denge
 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge
 They will feel that supporting their leader means opposing the media questioning him
 is chakkar main nuksaan kiskaa hota he
 Belongs to you
 america ke patrakaron ne to trump kii chunauti sweekaar kii, lekin uske bahut pehle se duniya bhar ke patrkaar ghotalebaz or jhuthe netaaon ke peeche pade hai
 Remind you of the Panama Papers that were continuously raided by the Indian Express for several days
 germany ke dakshini hisse main ek shahar he munich
 From here comes a newspaper called Jude Daeche Tsiteung
 german main jud kaa matlab hota he dakshin, doyche matlab germany or tcitung matlab akhbaar

 It was not easy to read millions of company and millions of documents
 wo bhi tab jab inaki jaanch ke liye duniya ke kai deshon main padtaal zaruri thi
 Therefore, the Jude Deutsche Tsiteung newspaper shared these documents with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar ek saal tak in dastavezon kii jaanch karte rahe
 The group also includes Indian Express from India whose Panama Papers have been printed in great detail in its website and newspaper
 ICIJ 76 deshon ke duniya bhar ke 109 sansthaanon ke khoji patrakaron kaa ek samooh he
 Crime, corruption is no longer confined to the border of one country, becomes the case of many countries, so it is important that journalists of many countries work together
 ICIJ main kai prakaar ke anbhavi log kaam karte hai khaskar ve log jo sarkari ricard ko padhane main daksh hote hai
 There are also fact checkers and lawyers
 bharat main aisa kai patrkaar apane str par kar rahe hai
 There are many websites that are becoming an alternative to journalism but they do not have as much reach as the media or social media controlled by political parties
 phek news ek chunauti to he hi
 Journalists are also presenting fake news and governments are also throwing news
 phek news matlab news ke naam par nakli news
 As soon as elections begin in India, the Election Commission starts to face the challenge of paid news
 paisa dekar yaa kisi or tareeke se vigyaapan dekar raajnneetik dalon ke haq main lahar paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Paid news is now a chronic problem
 ek or news he slo news
 The concept has been given by the BBC Director General Tony Hall
 tony haul kaa maananaa he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news

 One channel said that seven Pakistanis have been beheaded
 ye khabaren chhapi or logon tak pahunch bhi gayi
 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place
 sena ke maamle main saat or das sar kii kahani kya banaai gai yaa kisi ne galat brif kiya
 Editorial mistakes are made, there is a mistake in printing, but this news was from the front page
 saaf saaf likhaa tha ki bharat ne do ke badale das paak sainik maar giraae
 a mistake also occurred to me in Tuesday's prime time
 us galati main do galati hui
 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972
 yah soochna aar tii ai se mili he
 When the Railways investigated, it was found that the officials gave incorrect information in RTI
 in adhikariyon ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 We showed this news but till then i did not know about the railway's response
 phir ye galati he
 Railway officials gave wrong information to RTI, it appeared in RTI newspapers and from there in prime time
 hamane duusari galati ye ki 972 rupee ko 9,720 rupee likh diya
 i have no hesitation in apologizing for such a mistake
 lekin ye phek news nahin he

 Governments have started curbing journalists in the name of terrorism

 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is

 obama ne aath saal ke kaarykaal main 165 press conference kii thi
 Every year he held 20 press conferences
 kya bharat main kisi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri yaa kisi mukhyamantri ke bare main aap jaanate hai jo saal main 20 press conference karte hon, jahaan khulkar sawaal jawaab hote hon
 i am not paying attention
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists
 wo press ke kaam ko paini nazar se dekhne lagenge
 The American Press Corps is a large organization of American journalists whose center is located in New York's Columbia University
 har tarah ke news sanghathan or vichaardhaara ke patrkaar hai
 Respected elected President, aapke kaarykaal ke shuru hone ke antim dinon main hamane abhi hi saaf kar dena sahi samajha ki ham aapke prashasan or amareeki press ke rishton ko kaise dekhte hai
 We believe that there is tension in their relationship

 You have banned many news organizations from covering themselves
 aapane twitor par naam lekar patrakaron par taane kase hai, dhamkaaya he
 Has asked his supporters to do the same
 aapane ek reporter kaa yah kahkar mazaaq udaaya he ki uski baaten isliye acchhee nahin lagi ki vah viklang he
 They will make a mistake by ending the reporter's access to their administration
 ham soochna hasil karne ke tarah tarah ke raste khojane main maahir hai
 Many of the news organizations that you banned during your campaign have been excellent
 ham is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 Journalism rules are ours, not yours
 ham chaahe to aapke adhikariyon se aaf ricard baat karen yaa na karen
 If we wish, do not attend the record briefing
 agar aap yah sochate hai ki reporter ko chup kara dene yaa bhaga dene se story nahin milegi to galat hai
 We will try to take your side
 lekin ham sachai ko todane marodane waalon ko jagah nahin denge
 Whenever they do this, we will drive them away
 yah hamaara adhikaar he
 We will not repeat your lie
 aapaki baat chhaapenge lekin sachai kaa pataa karenge
 You and your staff sit in the White House, but the US government is quite wide
 ham sarkaar ke chaaron taraf apane reporter tainaat kar denge
 They will get into your agencies and bring news from bureaucrats
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane prashasnic imaarat se aane vaali khabaron ko roak len lekin ham aapaki nitiyon kii samiksha karke dikhaa denge
 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge

 It was not easy to read millions of company and millions of documents
 wo bhi tab jab inaki jaanch ke liye duniya ke kai deshon main padtaal zaruri thi
 Therefore, the Jude Deutsche Tsiteung newspaper shared these documents with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar ek saal tak in dastavezon kii jaanch karte rahe
 The group also includes Indian Express from India whose Panama Papers have been printed in great detail in its website and newspaper

 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972

 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is

 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world

 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he

 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he

 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he

 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he

 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany

 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year

 phek news ek chunauti to he hi
 Journalists are also presenting fake news and governments are also throwing news
 phek news matlab news ke naam par nakli news
 As soon as elections begin in India, the Election Commission starts to face the challenge of paid news
 paisa dekar yaa kisi or tareeke se vigyaapan dekar raajnneetik dalon ke haq main lahar paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Paid news is now a chronic problem
 ek or news he slo news
 The concept has been given by the BBC Director General Tony Hall
 tony haul kaa maananaa he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news

 One channel said that seven Pakistanis have been beheaded
 ye khabaren chhapi or logon tak pahunch bhi gayi
 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place
 sena ke maamle main saat or das sar kii kahani kya banaai gai yaa kisi ne galat brif kiya
 Editorial mistakes are made, there is a mistake in printing, but this news was from the front page
 saaf saaf likhaa tha ki bharat ne do ke badale das paak sainik maar giraae
 a mistake also occurred to me in Tuesday's prime time
 us galati main do galati hui
 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972
 yah soochna aar tii ai se mili he
 When the Railways investigated, it was found that the officials gave incorrect information in RTI
 in adhikariyon ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 We showed this news but till then i did not know about the railway's response
 phir ye galati he
 Railway officials gave wrong information to RTI, it appeared in RTI newspapers and from there in prime time
 hamane duusari galati ye ki 972 rupee ko 9,720 rupee likh diya
 i have no hesitation in apologizing for such a mistake
 lekin ye phek news nahin he
 Fake news is that which is being circulated among you in many ways these days

 Governments have started curbing journalists in the name of terrorism
 britain main ek kanoon paas hua he the Investigative Powers Act, ise snupar charter bhi kehete hai
 Under this, the journalist can be imprisoned for 14 years on charges of espionage
 aap apane sorce se kya baat karte hai wo bataanaa hoga or gupt soochna li karne ke aarope main jail ja sakate hai

 pakistan ke don akhbaar ke patrkaar siril alamida ne is saal 9 janvari ko ek khabar brake kii jisamen kaha gaya ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne apane faujee netritv ko saafe kah diya he ki agar aatankwaad ke kilaaf thos karrwai nahin kii gai to pakistan ke antarrashtriya birdari main alag thalag padane kaa khatara he
 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is

 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake

 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha

 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is

 How can anyone believe that a government which can put crores of people in banks' lines to change notes to prove its integrity, it cannot inspire the most responsible section of the country for a little transparency! The system wants to monitor every work of the common people, it cannot force the political parties of the country to even tell them that who gives them donations? After seeing Orl scheme of bonds or political donations coupons we can write that politics, if smart, he can bring in between legitimate mechanism to keep illegal maintain the illegal (bank)
 elactoral bond yaa coupon isi chatur ranneeti ke utpaada hai, jahaan bainkon kaa istemaal avaidhta ko dhakne ke liye hoga
 State Bank will sell Chanda coupons (1,000, 10,000, one lakh, ten lakh, one crore rupees)
 nirdhaarit aupchaariktaaon ke baad inhen kharid kar rajnatik dalon ko diya ja sakegaa
 Political parties will redeem it from the bank within 15 days
 coupon se mili chande kii jaankaree siyaasi dalon ko apane ritern (inakam tex or chunaav ayog) main deni hogi
 Actually, electoral bond is a new type of currency that will be used only for political donations
 samajhnaa jaruri he ki bharat main rajnatik chande daagi kyon hai
 This is not because they are given in cash
 2016 main notebandi ke thik bichobich rajnatik dalon ko 2,000 rupye kaa chanda nakad lene kii chhot mili thi jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 The donations are disputed because the country never gets to know who is donating which political party? The donor will not be named on this coupon as well
 yani yah siyaasi chande ko uske samgr avaidh rup main suvidhajanak banane kaa rasta he
 Let us count the number of concessions given to political donations: The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government made political donations as vips
 chanda dene vaali companiyaan ise apane khate main kharch dikhaakar tex se chhot le sakati hai jabaki siyaasi dalon ke liye chande puure tarah tex se mukt hai
 Data from the Association of Democratic Rights show that between 2012-16, the five major parties received 89 per cent (rs 945 crore) of their donations from companies
 yah lenden puri tarah tex free he
 The Congress government gave the facility to create an electoral trust for donations, through which money is given to political parties
 notebandi hui to bhi rajnatik dalon ke nakad chande behaal rahe
 The Modi government went another step forward
 vitt vidheyak 2017 main companiyon ke liye rajnatik chande par lagi adhiktam seemaa hataa lee gai
 Prior to this, companies made a maximum of 7 of their three-year net profit
 5 fisadi hissaa hi siyaasi chande ke taur par de sakati thim
 Companies are also allowed to not tell how much money they have paid to which party
 is kadar riyaayaton ke baavjood bada chanda nakad main dena phir bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Any amount of cash from electoral bonds will be convenient
 nakad chande apni puri apaardarshita ke saath bank coupon ke jariye siyaasi khaaton main pahunchenge
 Only the political party will know who gave what, not the voters
 farji pahchaan (kevaisi) ke saath kharide gaye elactoral coupon, kaale dhan kii tex free dhulaai main madad karenge!yah vaktad sarkaar se sidhe sawaal poochne kaa haverajanatik chande ko dohari (company or raajnneetik dal) iskar riyaayat kyon milani chahie? isse koun-si jan seva ho rahi he?chande kii gopneeyata banaae rakhkar rajnatik dal kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai? desh ko yah bataane main kya harj he ki koun kisko kitna chanda de rahaa he
 India's election funding is an ongoing financial scam
 yah ek viraat lenden he jo loktantr kii buniyadi sanstha arthath rajnatik dal ke jariye hota he
 It is a type of investment that gives returns when the donor comes to power
 kya hamen sweekaar kar lenaa chahie ki sarkaar kisi kii ho yaa netaa kitna bhi lokapriy ho, vah bharat kii sabase badi rajnatik kaalikh ko dhakne ke sankalp se koi samjhauta nahin karegaa! yah andher kabhi khatm nahin hoga!*** Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy has expressed his desire to join the Congress and has also met party Vice President Rahul Gandhi in Delhi

 According to an estimate, about one million people will gather in Washington DC on the day of the swearing-in ceremony
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya hogi is samaaroh kii khaasiyat
 
 
 Strong security arrangements will be held at the West Front of Capital Building
 iske liye ek asthaayee plateform banaaya gaya he jo washington monument se kareeb 1
 Is at a distance of 8 km
 monument or capital ke bich is duuri main hi janata baithegi or aasapaas kareeb 11 elidi screen bhi lagaae gaye hai, jinamein puraa aayojan dekha ja sakegaa
 The ceremony is taking place in the cloudy, cold weather in the US capital of Washington DC
 jagah-jagah bairicket lagi hui he or jabardast suraksha vyavastha he
 Around 28,000 security personnel have been deployed
 virodh pradarshan karne vaale bhi taiyaaris aayojan par aatanki khatra to he hi america ke hi kareeb 60 sanghathanon dwaara trump kaa virodh pradarshan karne kii ashanka suraksha karmiyon ke liye ek badi chunauti hogi
 About 30 organizations have received permits for demonstrations during and after the swearing-in, which is around 2
 70 lakh logon ke pradarshan main shaamil hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 The White House and the Capitol Hill area of about 7 km will be closed to general vehicles
 is dauraan aam janata kii suvidha ke liye shuukravaar ko subah 4 baje se raat 12 baje tak metro chalaaya jayega
 Swearing-in ceremony will be held in the afternoon at 11 am American time
 30 baje shuru hoga
 The ceremony will be held in the open, as the weather is fine
 thand evam badal to hai, lekin kharaab mausam nahin he
 However, due to the cloud, it is feared that there may be some rain during the parade
 shapath grahan se pehle chah isai dharmaguru bible paath or prarthana karenge
 This time a Jewish rabbi would also pray, just before Ronald Reagan was sworn in for the second time in 1985
 dopaher kareeb 12 baje shapath grahan ke baad trump apana shuruaati bhaashan denge
 The theme of his speech will be - 'make America Great Again' (make America Great Again), which has also been Trump's election slogan
 haath main hogi do bibiljankaron ke anusaar trump shapath grahan ke dauraan apane haath main do bible lekar aaenge
 The first Bible would be the one used in 1861 by former US President Abraham Lincoln for the oath
 duusari bible vah hogi jo trump kii maa ne unhen uphaar main diya he
 Obama also used Lincoln's Bible for swearing in 2009
 aisi koi sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he, lekin america ke zyaadaatar raashtrapati bible par haath rakhkar shapath lete hai
 John Robsarts, Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, will administer Trump to the oath
 obama bhi rahenge maujuudaisake pehle trump subah ek prarthana sabha main shaamil honge
 He will probably go to St
 John's Episcopal Church, located near the White House
 iske baad trump nivartmaan raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath milane white house jaaenge or unke saath coffee pienge
 President Obama will take Capitol Hill with him
 shapath grahan samaaroh ke dauraan obama or unki patni mishael obama maujuud rahenge
 Trump won the US presidential election last year
 unke samarthakon ko yah ummid he ki ve unke liye aarthik samruddhi lekar aaenge
 Some matches of next season of Indian Premier League (IPL) may be out of India
 yaa ho saktaa he ki kuch hi match bharat main hon, baaki baahar, bangladesh or srilanka main
 The reason is that when the general elections are held in 2014, the IPL time is also almost the same
 bisisiai ne ise lekar abhi se taiyaari shuru kar di he, taaki antim samay main pareshaani kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Earlier in 2009 general elections were held in India
 aapako yaad hoga tab ipel ke sabhi match south africa main karaane pade the
 The government then refused to provide security in IPL matches
 haalanki, loksabhaa chunaavon kii taarikh to abhi tak tay nahin he, phir bhi cricket board koi jokhim nahin uthaanaa chahta
 The term of this government will end in May 2014
 iske baad chunaav honge
 The IPL time is april-may
 aise main 2009 kii tarah is baar bhi donon ke kaarykram takaraa sakate hai
 According to BCCI sources, however, the situation will be completely cleared only when the dates of Lok Sabha elections are fixed
 lekin bahut sambhaavna he ki donon kaaryakramon main takaraav ho
 Therefore, contact is already being made with Bangladeshi and the Sri Lankan Cricket Board
 bisisiai ko jab south africa janaa padaa tha, tab board ko kaaphi kharch uthaanaa padaa tha
 Now that the rupee has weakened, spending in South Africa will increase even more
 bangladesh or srilanka donon deshon tak bharat se pahuchanaa aasaan he, isliye donon deshon main kuch match karaae ja sakate hai

 Describing the players' refusal to take the prize offered by Hockey India as a correct decision, Maken said, "I think they did fine by refusing to take Rs 25,000 as it would have been disrespectful to them
" hockey india ko chaiye tha ki pehle khilaadiyon yaa sarkaar se is bare main puch leti

 ’ Bala Movie Review: When hair starts falling while bathing in full youth, hair starts falling while combing in front of the mirror and then people around you start making fun of you, then the pain of that bald person Ayushmann Khurrana has himself appeared in front of the screen
 har us shaks jisane apane bal kam umr main khoyaa he or ganjepan ke mazaaq kaa shikaar bana he uski jubaan banakar ayushmaan ne na sirf ek sandesh diya balki jamkar gudgudaya
 What Amar Kaushik and the storyteller Niren Bhatt, who presented the newspaper advertisement on the screen, turned it into a story
 har ek jhadate bal kii qissagohi karnaa ayushmaan ne akele hi nahin ki balki film ke sabhi kirdaaron ne bakhubi nibhaayaa
 As people have always said that there is only one heart, how many times Ayushmann Khurana will win
 is baar bhi kuch aisa hi dekhne ko mila
 Balmukund Shukla means 'bala'
 bachapan main apane lambey baalo or jabardast atitude ke liye pahachaane jate the
 Not only this, at school, Kanpur's Sachin Chaudhary was famous for his hair style among girls
 teacher se lekar doston kaa majaak udaane main jaraa sa bhi vakt nahin lete, lekin vakt kaa pahiyaa aisa ghumaa ki khud majaak banane ko majaboor ho gaye
 The film starts in the native language of Kanpur and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh
 25 kii umr main bala (ayushmann Khurrana) kaa bal jhadanaa shuru ho gaya or phir lag gai wat
 Yes, because of hair fall all the time, more than 200 prescriptions were adopted, but still no solution was found
 aakhir main nakli baalo kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Latika Trivedi (bhumi Pednekar), who used to listen to the taunt of people since childhood due to black color, used to tease her classmate Bala
 phir life main aati hai pari mishra (yami Gautam), jo sach main bala kii jindagi ke liye pari hoti hai or phir shuru hota he film kaa asli majaa
 At the beginning of the film, you will start getting involved in back-to-back Kanpuria chatter and rhetoric
 bala (bala) yani ayushmaan khurana aapaki nazren kahin or jane dene kaa mauka nahin denge
 The actresses of the film Bhumi Pednekar and Yami Gautam fit in their character perfectly
 bhoomi ne apane dark skin luk main chaar chand laga diya
 At the same time, acting of Bala's father Saurabh Shukla, Mausha Latika's mother Seema Pahwa and Bala's brother Dhirendra Kumar Gautam's acting will win your heart
 pehali seen se lekar aakhri seen tak aapako seat chhodane kaa man nahin karegaa
 The story, dialogue, screenplay, music and acting of the film are tremendous
 ganjepan kii vajah se ek shaks kii jindagi main kaisaa bhuuchaal aata he or har vakt uskaa kaise majaak banataa he
 You can see it through Ayushman Khurana on the big screen
 beshak ayushmaan ek baar phir aapkaa dil jeet lenge
 Just before the general elections, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has turned the issue of the Ram temple in Ayodhya into a polarization towards bounce politics
 jisase upi sarkaar or vihip ke bich takaraav kii sthiti ban rahi he
 Meanwhile, in conversation with us, Singhal described Narendra Modi as the leader of Lord Rama's power and doing a lot for Hindu society
 unke mutabik ramalala kah gaye the ki baccha mandir kaa nirmaan kanoon se hi hoga or sabalog isamen sahyog karenge
 Here are excerpts of the conversation: Question - What is the purpose of this vhp's 84 Kos visit? Answer - 84 Kos travel was decided on the occasion of Kumbh in the month of February
 usamen charchaa hui thi ki ram janm bhoomi kaa nirmaan sansad se hi hoga, ye ab court kaa vishay nahin rahaa
 After 60 years, this decision has come where Ramlala is reputed, whereas Ram temple is there
 muslim vakf board jo baat kah rahaa tha ki usko masjid ghoshit kiya jaae or masjid ek plaground par banaai gai he, wo baat siddh nahin ho saki
 After Ramlala won the case, we were repeatedly told that you should wait and the decision will be made in your favor as soon as the decision is made
 faisla to haq main ho gaya
 Now the government is committed
 sarkaar ne jo 70 acre bhoomi adhigrahit kii he, ramajnmabhumi mandir ke liye samarpit kerani chahie
 The third point was said that the cultural boundary of Ayodhya will not be allowed to be an Islamic symbol under its purview
 yahi baat hamane 30 may main raashtrapati ko bhi kahi
 We have been liberated after 480 years from this crisis
 itane yudh, balidaan hue
 We do not want that any further
 isliye yah yatra hamaare santon ne tay kiya
 We said the same thing to Mulayam Singh and the Chief Minister
 do ghante kii vaarta main hamen kahin nahin laga ki ve yah nahin chaahate hai ki yatra nahin hogi, aisi baat kahin nahin kahi
 Rather we felt that by talking to our officials, they will support us, cooperate
 sawaal- ram mandir kaa maamla supreme court main lambit he, aise main is baat ko badhaane kii zarurat kyon?jawaab- dekhie, sansad hi sabase badi sanstha he
 Parliament will now have to decide
 ye vishay sansad kaa he court kaa nahin
 The decision has come from the court, where Ramlal is sitting, that is Ram Janmabhoomi
 hindu samaaj ko kab tak murkh banaaenge
 You can fool the Hindus of your party, but you fool the Hindus of all India forever, this is no longer possible
 iske liye jo baat kahi ja rahi he ki supreme court tay karegaa, ab ye vishay parliament ko tay karne kaa he
 The government is committed
 sawaal- kaha ja rahaa he ki 2014 ke chunaav or bijepi main modi ko aage badhaane ke liye viechpi aakraamak ho rahaa he?jawaab- ye santon kaa puraa kaarykram he
 With this movement, huge manpower is being prepared as devotees
 ye rambhakt aisi sarkaar bhi chaahate hai jo ram janmabhumi mandir kaa nirmaan bhi kar sake
 Saints are not political and never will be
 lekin rambhakt chahenge ki desh main aisi sarkaar bane jo sansad main is kanoon ko banaae
 Because i have great faith that Ramlala also said that the child will become its law
 unhone kaha tha iskaa kanoon banegaa or sab log iskaa samarthan karenge
 i believe that the subject of Ram Janmabhoomi is not going to be decided by the court, will be from Parliament and everyone will cooperate together
 lagbhag 450 saansadon se vihip kaaryakartaaon kaa milanaa hua he
 Nobody opposed it
 sawaal- samay par sawaal uthaa rahaa he or kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi ko phayda dilaane ke liye vihip abhi mudda uthaa rahi he?jawaab- agar rambhakt maanenge ki bijepi hamen phayda dilaaegaa to koun roak saktaa he rambhakton ko
 Do you understand that the people of the Rambhakt Samajwadi or the Congress who have bankrupted the country, drowned it, creating an economic crisis in the country
 aise luteron ke haath main dekhenge kya
 Today, there are circumstances that if people have no other choice, what will the devotees do? rambhakt chahenge ki desh main gau kii raksha karne vaale aane chahie, ganga kii raksha karne vaale, desh main samaan aachaar samhita lagu karne vaale aane chahie
 Society wants to get rid of the government that takes this country to waste
 sawaal- viechpi pehle vaajapeyi sarkaar ke khilaaf mukhar rahi he, kya modi se ummid he behatar kii?jawaab- rambhakt jo chahenge, vahi hoga
 This is my belief
 wo din chale gaye or badal gaye
 Question- It is being said that at the end of January, in the meeting of bjp-vhp-sangh, it was decided that electoral strategy will be made by combining development-hindutva? Answer- BJP is a matter of consideration for the people
 unka menithesto aayaa nahin he
 i believe that all the things are going to come in the manifesto
 ye saare vishay us ghoshnaptr main honge
 Question- What will you do if the yatra is not allowed? Answer- It is not ready to allow the yatra
 magar jab yatraaen nikalni he jin din or jis padaav se nikalni he vahaan par janata ikatthi hogi or padayatra karegi
 The saints will reach there and the journey will go on
 us yatra ko rokane kaa wo kaisaa prayaas karte hai vahi hamen dekhnaa he kyonki hajaaron kii sankhya main janata yatra main bhaag legi to use kaise roak sakenge ye log
 There was talk of stopping in Ayodhya, Ayodhya is limited, but the journey has covered the area in five districts, where will they stop us
 har din 200 sant aaenge, santon ko rokane se ye pad yatra samaapt nahin hone vaali
 Question- More than three thousand temples are 80 percent dilapidated, why not VHP? Answer - The temples used to run royalty
 1947 main rajavaade khatm
 After that it was the responsibility of the central government
 lekin hindu samaaj kii avhelnaa kii he, mandiron kii upeksha kii he, iske liye jimmedaar koun he
 Question- It is being feared that the communal harmony can be spoiled by this visit
 jawaab- koi sampradayik sauhadrr nahin bigadega
 External elements will not be able to direct their owl
 is desh ke bheetar musalmaan shanti se rahanaa chahta he wo sangharsh nahin karnaa chahta, bahari tatv uske bich main baithkar sangharsh karana chaahate hai
 Question- It is being said that the bjp-sangh strategy is traveling on the issue of VHP temple? Answer- This is a matter between VHP and saints
 is vishay par bijepi or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh
 i can say one thing about the Sangh that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been in support of the movement from the beginning and will remain because of its commitment
 bijepi main bahut badi sankhya main sangh ke log hai
 Those who have gone in them and the crores of people who will support them even today
 sawaal- bijepi se vihip ke rishte behad khattey rahe hai, aap khud bhi mukhar rahe the
 That BJP was helpless 10 years ago
 atal ji ne kaha tha ki hamako bahumat do, unako bahumat nahin mila isliye mandir nahin ban sakaa
 He said so
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki ek kaam wo karte to bahut acha hota ki isko sadan main le aate or agar sarkaar chali jaati to dekhte chali jaati
 They did not do this
 phir bhi meraa maananaa he ki is desh main phir se rambhakton kaa bahumat sansad main aae, iske liye hamaara prayaas he
 Question- So do you hope that if a government is formed under the leadership of Modi, then they will bring the proposal in the Parliament? Answer- Why not
 wo sirf itnaa hi nahin karenge, balki bahut kuch karenge
 i believe that when God has entered them in the form of the power of Lord Rama, then what will you do? hamaare yahaan par aaj jis prakaar kaa shashan chahie, duniya main hamaara mastak ooncha rahe, aisa shashan chahie
 That rule could never be formed in our country
 duniya kii mahashaktiyon main ham khadey hon
 Bane hum, it was never thought
 is soch ke saath hi khadey hon, tabhi parivartan hoga
 Question- You said that in the conversation with mulayam-akhilesh, you did not think that you will not give permission, now who do you hold responsible? Answer- See, i agree that the statement of Azam Khan has come that Mulayam Singh should have Ashok Singhal, Should not have met saints
 mujhe lagata he ki ye baat unako saarvajanik nahin bolni chahie thi
 He would have understood if he had spoken to them alone
 lekin isse baat kahin khul gai he ab mulaayam palat gaye hai to uske peeche ajam khan hai or ajam or islamic dictate se hi mulaayam singh chal rahe hai, hindu samaaj kii bhaavana ko kuchalanaa chaahate hai, daman karnaa chaahate hai
 This is due to Azam Khan's policy today, i believe

 Photos of the grand Mehrangarh Fort located in Jodhpur in Rajasthan are being shared widely on social media
 saath hi ye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki is kile se puraa pakistan dikhaai detaa he

 ye sirf usee surat main sambhav ho saktaa jab pahaado kii koi range itani duuri par sthit ho
 If such an argument is accepted as true, then parts of Pune can also be seen from the Imperial Towers of Mumbai
