 No one would have imagined that the Board of Control for Cricket in India, whose strength speaks up to the International Cricket Committee ie the ICC, will have to lose two powerful presidents, first N
 Srinivasan and then Anurag Thakur
 vishwa cricket ke is chaunkaane vaale ghatnakram ke peeche jis ek shaks ko sabase zyada jimmedaar bataaya ja rahaa he wo he bihar ke ek chote se jile chhapra se aane vaale bijnesaman aditya verma
 53-year-old Aditya was once part of Bihar's Ranji team and his fight was also to get his identity back to this team
 aditya verma ne jab bisisiai ke aakaaon se do-do haath karne kaa faisla kiya tha to unki ladaai mahaj iske liye thi ki bihar cricket association ko bisisiai se manyata mil jaae
 Verma approached the court after the BCCI denied it
 dhire-dhire ye kanoonee sangharsh bhartiya cricket itihaas ke sabase krantikari badlaavon kaa kaaran bana or anuraag thakur or ajay shirke jaise diggajon kii ek jatke main barkhaastagi ho gai
 The foundation of the quarrel was found in 2000, this battle of Aditya Verma laid the foundation in the year 2000 when Bihar was bifurcated along with Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and states like Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand respectively came into existence
 madhyapradesh or upi kii cricket associationon par to is vibhaajan kaa koi bada asar nahin padaa lekin bihar cricket association kaa naam badalakar jharkhand cricket association kar diya gaya
 The BCCI also gave him full state association recognition

 He is the secretary of this association

 Former BCCI chief n Srinivasan was forced to relinquish his chair only after court orders came during the hearing of his petitions
 tab mana ja rahaa tha ki aditya verma ke peeche shrinivasana ke dhur virdohi lalit modi kaa haath he jo verma ke bahaane shrinivasana ko bedakhal karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The special thing is that despite Srinivasan's departure and Anurag Thakur's ascension to the post of BCCI President, Aditya's motive was not resolved as the Association of Bihar was not recognized
 verma ko ab ummid he ki thakur ke hatane se or justise lodha cameti kii siforishein lagu hone se bihar ko manyata kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 Nizam badal in BCCI, niyat nahiaditya argues that when three teams of states like Gujarat and Maharashtra play in Ranji then why a big state like Bihar has been denied this
 1935 se bihar cricket association BCCI kaa purna sadsy tha
 He also had a Ranji team in which Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India's most successful captain, has played
 use sirf isliye manyata nahin di ja rahi kyonki bisisiai ke aakaaon ko uskaa vot apane khilaaf padane kii ummid thi
 When Aditya started this fight, his arguments in the media were not much preferred
 ve jis tarah court main yachikaayen daayar karte hai usase unke kareebi unhen adatan yachikakarta tak kehane lage the
 His son has played in the Bengal Under-19 team and knows that his further career is dark due to his father's feud with the BCCI bosses
 aditya verma bhale hi lo profile rahete hon lekin siyasat or cricket main unke kai dost hai
 Ever since he started two hands with the BCCI, many of his new friends have been made since then, some of them have been separated from him
 ek website se baatcheet main unhone khud bataaya ki bisisiai ke kai kaddavar vartmaan or nivartmaan padaadhikari unase sampark main rahete the

 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar has slammed the opposition's plan to form a grand alliance against the BJP
 buudhvaar kii shaam nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya or rajd, congress vaale mahagathbandhan se alag hokar bijepi kii aguwai vaale endie se haath mila liya
 Nitish Kumar will be sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar at 10 am today
 bijepi bhi nitish kii sarkaar main shaamil hogi, to pradhanmantri narendra modi bhishapath grahan main pahunchenge
 The Congress-led opposition parties have openly criticized Nitish's move
 umr abdulla ne nitish ko 'rishta mubarak' kaha he, to sipiai ke di raja ne kaha ki nitish ko lekar yah shaq tha or yah ho gaya
 Now that Nitish is standing with Narendra Modi, the question is how strong is the political solidarity of the opposition parties
 kahaan khadey hai vipakshi dal-rashtriya str par mahagathbandhan ko jatakanithish ke bijepi ke saath jane se rashtriya str par narendra modi kii aguwai vaali bijepi ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan banane kii vipaksh kii koshishon ko karaara jhatka laga he
 It is now difficult to maintain solidarity in the opposition with more than a dozen parties
 vipaksh ke paas nitish ke rup main rashtriya str par sweekaarya ek cheharaa tha, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Opposition's resistance to Nitish's clean NDA with a clean image has become lighter

 It remains to be seen how Lalu Yadav can handle his political car amidst all these obstacles

 It was said that Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi had a good relationship with Nitish
 lalu ke saath bhi congress kii apni raajnneetik saajhedaari rahi he
 Yet the Congress leadership failed to save the Grand Alliance
 haalanki congress ke liye nitish ke mukaable lalu zyada bharosemand rahe hai or yahi vajah lagati he ki congress lalu ke khilaaf nahin ja pai
 Nitish's entry into the NDA has weakened the Congress's siege against Narendra Modi
 lalu-nitish kii is cross firing main congress ke bheetar bhi matbhed tha
 Some leaders believed that Nitish was doing politics to create pressure, while senior leaders believed that the game was complete in Bihar

 There is not only a chance to be happy but also an age
 is baat kaa khulaasa ek research main hua he
 According to a new study by the American think tank, people are happiest at the age of 16 and then at the age of 70
 ‘rejolushan foundation' ne sabase adhik or sabase kam sukh kaa akalan karne ke liye aadhikarik data kaa vishleshan kiya
 It was found that the level of happiness depends very much on one's age, income level, being home and where they live and according to them its level is different in everyone
 think tanks ne kaha, “report main paaya gaya ki sukh-samruddhi kaa str aam taur par 25-26 saal kii umr se shuru hokar 50 saal kii umr hone se pehle tak girane lagata he or phir 70 saal kii umr tak yah str ek baar phir badhanaa shuru ho jaataa he
 This level of happiness and prosperity includes happiness, life satisfaction, importance and worry life
 keval umr ko aadhaar maan kar dekha jaae to 16 yaa 70 kii umr main insaan sabase zyada khush rahata he
 "happy Now?" This report, titled, found that one of the most important factors of well-being is good health, job and a spouse, but this level of happiness depends on age, income level, neighborhood, living in your home, etc
 Varies from person to person
 is report ke jariye niti-nirmaataaon se apil kii gai he ki ve logon main sukh-samruddhi ke bhav ko badhaane ke liye gaharaai se in karkon par gaur karen or phir praathamikta se is disha main kaam karen

 Prosecutors filed the application in the court of Judge Malik Muhammad Akram Awan, hearing the trial of seven accused, including lashkar-e-taiba commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi

 saavant vaghule tathaa jaanch adhikari ramesh mahale ko rawalpindi kii aatankwaad rodhi adaalat main gavaahi ke liye bhejne ko kaha tha
 India denied the possibility of sending these two officials to Pakistan, but also said that they could be talked through video conferencing
 pakistan ke grih mantri rahamaan malik kaa kahana he ki donon bhartiya adhikariyon kii gavaahi lenaa kanoonee aavashyaktaa he or isse saat pakistani sandigdhon ke khilaaf mukademe kii kaarywahi tej karne main madad milegi
 Experts believe that the testimony of the two Indian officials is also important because the trial relies heavily on Kasab's statement
 lakhvi samet maamle ke saaton abhiyukton kaa adaalat main bachaav kar rahe vakil abhiyojan kii is arji ko mukademe kii kaarywahi latakaane kaa hatkandaa qaraar de rahe hai
 Shahbaz Rajput, one of the defense advocates, said, "this petition is blatant and a waste of time
" pakistan ke maujuuda kanoonon ke mutabik video conferencing ke jariye kisi kaa bayaan lenaa mumkin nahin he
 Rajput said, "we will oppose this application
" hamaare muvakkil takreeban do saal se hiraasat main hai or abhiyojan paksh kii taraf se aise yachikaayen daayar kiya janaa is baat kii saaf nishaani he ki vah maamle ko latakaana chahta he

 ganga kii is durdasha ko sudhaarney ke naam par karodon rupee kharch kiye gaye
 The country's largest court also reprimanded the government for correcting the condition of the Ganges
 modi sarkaar ne bhi ganga se bade-bade vaade kiye, lekin ganga kaa dard jas kaa tas he
 Despite this, faith and faith did not diminish
 ganga ke avataran ke din hazaron logon ne ganga main dubkee lagaai or pujan-archan kiya
 But in this worship, people offer flower garlands in the Ganges
 yah hazaron shraddhaluon kii aasthaa kii nishaani he, par yahi aasthaa ganga ko pradooshan kaa dard bhi de jaati he
 When the Ganges used to flutter with its strong current, it would throw these flowers and garlands and throw it away from its clasp and remain serene to its devotees
 par aaj ganga kai baandhon main kaid he
 There is not much strength in his dead stream that he can shed it
 lihaaja logon kii ye aasthaa us par baari pad rahi he
 Nirmal, a bathmate, also agrees, saying that in the name of faith, we are spreading flowers by garlanding flowers
 hona ye chahie ki ye sab kahin ek kinare kone main ho
 Such faith is definitely a stain in the Ganges, but the great pain is the waste of the drains and factories falling in the Ganges
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq har saal 3000 MLD sivej ganga main daal diya jaataa he, jisamen akele banaras main 300 MLD sivej daalaa jaataa he
 In the sewage dumped in the Ganges, we are able to treat only 1000 MLD, the remaining 2000 MLD sewage is being shed like this
 tippaniyan From the Ganga Action Plan started in 1986, crores of rupees have been washed away, but the condition of Ganga has not improved
 log ab bilkul naa-ummid hai
 Those whose life goes on the ghats, the priest of the ghat bursts as soon as the child asks Maharaj Ganga cleaning, "the drain is flowing from eighty to Varuna, garbage is falling from eighty to Varuna, flower garlands are rotting from eighty to Varuna
 Huh
 laashen bah rahi hai
 There is no change
 " Who said that drinking water of Ganga and bathing, did not leave even the hunger
 par ganga sirf nadi nahin he, ye jitna jameen par bahati he, usase zyaada hamaare dilon main bahati he
 Even after spending thousands of crores of rupees and all the claims and promises, the condition of Ganga is getting worse day by day, but the faith and reverence for Ganga is equally strong today
 tabhi to ganga chaahe jitani gandi ho gai ho, uske god main hazaron log dubkee lagaate nazar aate hai
 On the day of the descent of the Ganges, thousands of people took a dip in the Ganges and worshiped
 lekin isi pujan-archan main ganga main log phool maala chadhaate hai
 This is a sign of faith of thousands of devotees, but this belief also gives the pain of pollution to Ganga
 jab ganga apni tej dhara ke saath ithlaati hui baha karti thi, tab to wo in phool-maalaon ko samet kar apane daaman se dur phenk aati thi or apane bhakton ke liye vah nirmal bani rahati thi
 But today Ganges is imprisoned in many dams
 uski dam tod chuki dhara main itani taaqat nahin ki wo ise baha sake
 So this faith of the people is overshadowing him
 snanarthi nirmal bhi isse ittefaq rakhte hue kahati hai ki aasthaa ke naam par ham hi log phool, maala chadhaakar gandagi failaa rahe hai
 It should be that it is all in one corner somewhere
 is tarah kii aasthaa ganga ke daaman main daag zarur he, par bada dard ganga main gir rahe naale or factoriyon kaa kachra he
 According to a rough estimate, 3000 MLD sewage is dumped into the Ganges every year, with 300 MLD sewage being dumped in Benares alone
 ganga main daale jane vaale sivej main ham sirf 1000 MLD kaa hi treetment kar pate hai, baaki 2000 MLD sivej aise hi baha diya ja rahaa he
 The comments 1986 se shuru hue ganga ection plan se lekar aaj tak karodon rupee bah gaye, lekin ganga kii dasha nahin sudhari
 People are totally hopeless now
 ghat par hi jinaki jindagi chalati he wo ghat ke pujari baccha mahraaj ganga kii safai ko poochhate hi fat padate hai, "assi se varuna tak naala bah rahaa he, assi se varuna tak kooda gir rahaa he, assi se varuna tak phool maalaaen sad rahi hai
 Corpses are flowing koi badlaav nahin he
 " is bekadari ne ganga ke pani ko pine or nahaane kii koun kahe aachman laayak bhi nahin choda
 But the Ganges is not just a river, it flows in our hearts more than it flows on the land
 hazaron karod rupee kharch karne or tamaam daavon or vaadon ke baad bhi din ba din ganga kii dasha kharaab hi hoti ja rahi he, lekin ganga ke prati aasthaa or shraddha aaj bhi utani hi balwati he
 That is why the Ganges, however dirty it has become, thousands of people dip in its lap
 snanarthi nirmal bhi isse ittefaq rakhte hue kahati hai ki aasthaa ke naam par ham hi log phool, maala chadhaakar gandagi failaa rahe hai

 In the 15th Lok Sabha, Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj's white SUV car arrives in the premises of the returning officer of Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh
 kshan bhar baad hi siem shivaraj singh chouhan kaa kafila yahaan pahunchataa he, chouhan kii patni sadhana singh bhi unke saath hai
 In the presence of the Chauhan couple, Sushma Swaraj wearing a tight cotton saree and black Nehru jacket did not take 15 minutes to fill the nomination

 shivasena ke divangat supremeo bal thakare ne bhi kabhi kaha tha ki pradhanmantri pad ke liye sushamaa unki pehali pasand hai
 So can another candidate from Vidisha be a potential prime minister? It is worth noting that Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the Prime Minister after winning elections from here

 Not surprisingly, the posters that Vidisha's tight and dusty streets are lined with are different from the party's national level campaign where Modi is the only one

 Last month, Sushma addressed party workers several times but mentioned Modi's name only once - on 24 March in Raisen
 apane bhaashanon main ve chouhan kaa hi gungan karti hai, ‘‘bijepi ke paas narendra modi ke rup main pradhanmantri pad ke liye yogya netaa he, or madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan ke rup main ek mahaan netaa
 Chauhan's efficient leadership, sensitivity to the problems of the people, public welfare schemes and resentment of the UPA government's misrule at the center will bring us huge success in the state

 After meeting party workers in Bari and Obedullahganj, Minister of State for Tourism Surendra Patwa twice predicted that Sushma Swaraj would become the Deputy Prime Minister in the next government
 sushamaa ne to is par aapatti nahin kii lekin yah rashtriya netritv ko akhra
 Patwa immediately gave a clarification to India Today, saying that Vidisha had earlier won many leaders who later earned a name
 inamen atal bihari vaajapeyi or shivaraj singh chouhan hai
 "(narendra Modi's disappearance from BJP Hardings in Vidisha is doubtful)" Swaraj is giving the slogan of "mission 29" to win 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 pradesh bijepi netritv kaa daawa he ki yah modi ke ‘‘mishan 272’’ ke anukool hi he
 Yet the Sangh is not comfortable with this
 bhopal main sangh ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ‘‘bijepi ne abhiyaan ke liye ek rashtriya agenda taiyaar kiya he
 It should not change at the local level

 "senior BJP leaders also believe that there has been a" lack of trust "between the party and the Sangh in the state
 khaskar adwani ko gandhinagar se ladaane ke faisle ke baad
 He says, "to avoid making Modi and Advani's differences public, Advani was not nominated as a candidate from Gandhinagar, but the Sangh believed that if Advani was to be contested from Bhopal, a trio of advani-swaraj-chauhan is a powerful a faction is formed, which is not correct
 ’’ haalanki pradesh party pravaktaa hitesh vaajapeyi kehete hai, ‘‘taqatvar gut kii baat kori kalpana he
 "one of the founders of the Jana Sangh in the state, another long-time MLA and a senior BJP leader, says that Sushma has a longing to get the highest post in the country
" unka yah bhi kahana he ki rashtriya raajnneeti main sthaan paane ke liye shivaraj bhi sushamaa par nirbhar karte hai
 He says, "sushma Raj" does not interfere in the functioning of the government
 lekin rajya main party main unka kaaphi dabadabaa he
 When Advani decided to contest from Bhopal, the celebrations started here
 bhopal adwani ke postaron se pat gaya tha
 According to sources, the Sangh intervened and asked to remove the poster as soon as possible
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main sangh ke prachaar pramukh narendra jain kehete hai, ‘‘main is bare main kuch nahin jaanata
 According to BJP District President Alok Sharma in Bhopal, the party has deployed a two-member team to find out who put those posters and hoardings

 According to sources, since last June when Advani first called Chauhan a "bigger leader" than Modi, the RSS was keeping a close watch on Madhya Pradesh

 Though the RSS does not participate in the election campaign at the national level, Bhagwat instructed his organization to be active in Madhya Pradesh and also asked to deploy campaigners at polling booths across the state
 bijepi sutron kaa kahana he ki adwani ko bhopal ke liye ‘‘nimantran’’ dene kii yojana bhi unke vahaan se chunaav ladgaye kii ichha jataane se kai maah pehle se ataki thi
 From here, 85-year-old Kailash Joshi, MP and former Chief Minister of the state, was not kept in the list to avoid trouble
 2009 main joshi ne swaraj ke liye seat khaali karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 In early March, when the state BJP sent the list of party candidates to the headquarters at Ashok Road for approval, the Bhopal seat was kept vacant
 chouhan or pradesh bijepi adhyaksh narendra tomars ne joshi ko milane ke liye bulaayaa tha
 The next day, on March 9, Joshi announced that he would not contest
 joshi ke mutabik yah unka nijee faisla tha, ‘‘is ghoshnaa ke baad maine adwani ji ko phone kiya or bhopal se ladgaye kaa aamantran diya
 They said they would look into it

 But Modi is at the forefront of campaigning in the state

 According to Chauhan's close aides, he will not talk to the national media till the elections are held

 Swaraj's additional private secretary Rajendra Sinha also says that Swaraj has decided not to talk to the national media

 The Modi government, inaugurating the Mudra scheme in April 2015, has so far distributed easy loans worth millions of crores for starting small and medium businesses across the country
 mangalvaar subah piem narendra modi namo ap or video conferencing ke jariye mudra yojana ke labhaarthiyon se rubaru hue
 While conferencing the beneficiaries of the Mudra Yojana, 'modi used to get loans by calling on the Finance Minister', PM Modi said that in previous governments, loans were available only to those who were identified
 pichhali sarkaron main siem yaa vitt mantri khud phone kar apane pasand ke udhyamiyon ko lone dilavaate the
 According to the PM, there was a time in this country, when the Finance Minister himself did not do anything to call and get loans to big industrialists, on the other hand, a small entrepreneur would drown his entire life in interest loans due to the interest of moneylenders
 Was
 mudra yojana ne byajkhor logon se desh ke yuva logon ko bachaaya he
 PM Modi said that loan fairs used to run for political benefits in previous governments
 ham chote udhyamiyon ko bhi lone dene ke liye mudra yojana lekar aae
 The Mudra scheme gave recognition to the skills of the common people
 mudra yojana ke 12 karod logon main se 55% lone desh ke SC / ST / OBC samaaj ke yuvaaon or mahilaon ko mila he
 Loans worth Rs 6 lakh crore have been given under the Mudra scheme
 sabase zyada lone mahilaon or daliton kopiem modi ne daawa kiya ki mudra yojana ke tahat sabase zyada lone mahilaon, garib dalit logon ko mila he
 Mudra scheme prevented the migration of youth
 labhaarthiyon se baatcheet karte hue modi bole ki mudra yojana main bainkon ko salaah duungaa ki research project par zyada se zyada lone den
 PM Modi also said that since independence, we have seen the disease of license raj in our country, the loan was given to one who was identified, or had a name, on the pretext of putting the middle lower class of the country out of the system
 Given, because he had neither name nor recommendation
 pichhali sarkaron main raajnneetik phaaydon ke liye chalate the lone melemodi ke anusaar aaj se 25 - 30 saal pehle siyaasi phaayde ke liye lone meley chalate the, or jo rajnatik log the, unke saath chele chapatte, thekedaar, votbank kii raajnneeti, ye bainkon se rupee maar le jate the

 We trusted our small entrepreneurs
 mudra yojana ke tahat unako lone diya gaya taaki wo apana kaarobaar kar sake
 The Mudra scheme not only created self-employment opportunities, but it is also acting as a job-multiplier in itself
 '28 pratishat lone pehali baar kaarobaar shuru karne vaale logon ko'mudra yojana par piem modi ne kaha ki kai baar sarkaar ke paas yojanaon ke liye fund hota he lekin uskaa upyog nahin hota, lekin mudra ek aisi yojana he jisamen lakshya se adhik lone diye gayi hai, or 28% lone unhen diye gayi jinhone pehali baar apana kaam shuru kiya he
 Without a bank guarantee, loans at low interest rates, the youth would start some employment on their own as soon as they were living in their city or villages, today the poorest of the poor are getting a Mudra loan, even the normal person with the help of Mudra loan Can be made
 labhaarthiyon ne bataai saxes storimudra yojana labhaarthi nasik ke hari ganor thakur ne bataaya ki is yojana ne unki jindagi badal di
 Manjunath of Karnataka, the beneficiary of the Mudra Yojana, said that he started his business by taking a loan from Mudra Yojana instead of a government job
 ab vah samay se lone bhi chukaa rahe hai or 4 logon ko rojgaar bhi de rahe hai
 Hriday Deka of Assam, the beneficiary of the Mudra Yojana, told that he took his tea business forward by taking a Mudra loan
 piem ne is par kaha ki matlab aap bhi mere jaise ho
 After hearing the success story of the targeted people on those who took loans, PM Modi said that big people run away with loans, poor people know to live a life of honor by paying a loan

 In his book 'legendots of Hyderabad', former bureaucrat Narendra Luther has written many interesting articles, which is based on documentary evidence, interviews and personal experiences associated with the city, famous for its romantic origins and mixed culture
 inamen se ek dilachasp kahani 'jai hind' naare kii utpatti se judi he
 According to the author, the slogan was given by Zainul Abidin Hasan, the son of a collector in Hyderabad, who went to Germany to study engineering
 luther ke anusaar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan netaji bharat ko aaazaad karaane ko lekar sashastr sangharsh ke liye samarthan jutaney germany chale gaye the
 He said, 'netaji met Indian war prisoners and other Indians there and appealed to them to join their fight

 Hearing this, Hassan left his studies and became Netaji's secretary and interpreter
 ' According to the author, Hassan later became a major in the INA (indian National Army) and participated in marches across the border from Burma (myanmar) to India
 iene tab imphal tak pahunch gai thi
 He had to retreat due to lack of supplies and weapons
 luther ne likhaa he, 'netaji apni sena or aaazaad bharat ke liye ek bhartiya abhibhavan sandesh chaahate the
 Got lots of advice
 hasan ne pehle 'hello' shabd diya, isapar netaji ne unhen dapat diya
 He then gave the slogan of 'jai Hind', which Netaji liked and thus 'jai Hind' became the official form of greeting of INA and revolutionary Indians

 In another application, the government presented a time limit of 400 days for the auction of spectrum
 nyaayalay ne license radd karte hue isaki nilaamee ke liye chaar maheene kaa samay diya hua he
 The Center stated in its application, 'since licenses (spectrum) can only be issued in or around March 2013 and with effect from June 2, 2012, the licenses have been canceled

 Regarding the formulation of policy in the review petition, the jurisdiction of the apex court can be questioned by arguing that the auction of 2G spectrum will affect its policy objectives as ordered by the court

 The petition can argue that the 2008 first-come-first-served policy, in which 122 licenses were allocated, helped to increase telecom density and make wireless service cheaper

 It was said that no other actor can do justice to Sanjay's role
 film kaa aakhri hissaa khud sanjay dutt ko karnaa chahie tha
 After Ranbir Kapoor on Salman's statement, now the reaction of director Rajkumar Hirani has come to the fore
 diarector ne kaha, ''agar sanjay apni byopic main khud apana hi role nibhaate to log film ke saath conect nahin kar pate
 For a moment i also thought in my mind that Sanjay should work in the final part of the film
 lekin mujhe ye ajeeb sa laga
 He further says that the person who is seeing Ranbir in the role of Sanju first, will suddenly see Sanjay on screen
 aise main yakeenan hi public film se conect nahin kar paaegi''sanju ke liye ranbir-ranvir par bahes, vidhu vinod chopra bole- main pagal thavhin salmaan ke bayaan par ranbir ne kaha tha, ''aisa kabhi nahin hua he ki kisi shaks ne khud apni byopic main kaam kiya ho
 By doing this, the effect of the character is eliminated
 mujhe pataa he ki meri tulana sanjay dutt se kii jaaegi
 That is why i have worked hard and tried to do justice to the character
 ''unhone aage kaha, ''chaahe log mujhe 40 saal ke sanjay dutt ke rup main dekhe yaa 20 saal ke, unhen aisa laganaa chahie ki wo ek kalakaar ko dekh rahe hai, jo sanjay dutt kaa role nibhaa rahaa he
 It is true that i cannot become another Sanjay Dutt
 ''kitni auraton ke saath soe ho? sanju ke samvaad par naaraazgi, shikayatabata den, salmaan ne kaha tha, ''yadi film ke baad vaale hisse main sanjay dutt kaa kirdaar khud sanjay ne nibhaayaa hota to behatar hota
 For 'sanju' i felt why someone else is doing it to such an extent? The last 8–10 years roll

 Sanju himself had to play the last part

 Senior BJP leader Syed Shahnawaz Hussain on Thursday objected to the granting of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, targeting 'muslim intellectuals' and said Article 35A was 'against Islam'
 purvi champaran jila mukhyalay motihaari main ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa hossain ne aarope lagaaya ki nirast sanvaidhanik praavdhaan ne jammu-kashmir ke baahar ke kisi vyakti se shaadi karne kii sthiti main paitruk sampatti par mahila ke adhikaar ko chin liya tha, jo sharia ke khilaaf tha
 He said that the Muslim intellectuals who are opposing the action of the Narendra Modi government on Jammu and Kashmir and making it a Hindu vs Muslim issue, have a question whether they feel that Article 35A is according to the Sharia law of Islam Was
 pravartan nideshaalay ne naksali cmanderon kii do karod 89 lakh rupaye kii jabt kii sampattihusain ne kaha ki sharia kanoon ke anusaar ek bacchee ko uske mata-pita se viraasat main mili sampatti par uske adhikaron se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 But Article 35A made him bet
 nishchit rup se samvidhan dwaara pradutt samanta ke adhikaar ke ulanghan ke alaava yah islam ke usulon ke khilaaf tha
 The former Union Minister said that Muslim intellectuals should introspect on this issue
 puure desh main enarasi lagu karne ke kendriya mantri amit shah ke bayaan kaa bachaav karte hue ki hossain ne poocha ki logon ko isse kya samasya he
 He said that no country in the world tolerates people crossing their borders illegally
 ham bharat main avaidh avrajan kii anumati dene kii ummid nahin kar sakate hai
 The BJP leader insisted that the recent controversy between the state-level leaders of his party and the JDU over the issue of recognizing Nitish Kumar as the Chief Ministerial candidate in next year's Bihar assembly elections was emphasized
 goa main aaj GST council kii baithak, kya auto sector ko mandi se ubaarane ke liye kar sakati he tex katautee?unhone kaha ki bhaajapa abhi maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaari main vyast he or sambandhit rajyon ke mukhyamantri party kaa cheharaa hai
 Hussain said that this is going to be the first time that a US President will share the stage with the Indian Prime Minister on his soil

 bijepi ko chaaron khaane chit karke or congress kaa supada saaf karke dilli kii bagdor sanbhaalane vaali aam aadmi party ne apane kaarykaal kaa ek saal puraa kar liya
 In a year, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his party have made considerable progress
 badlaav kii raajnneeti karne kaa daawa kar satta main ai AAP ne ek saal main badlaav kii jo seedhiyaan chadhi hai vah kaaphi ahm hai
 Be it a matter of friendship or enmity or goal
 
 
 saal badla, 'dushman' badale:bhrashtachar kaa mudda lekar raajnneeti main kudane vaale arvind kejariwal or unki party kekamkajur ravaiye main kaaphi badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 The rivalry of the AAP, which started a campaign against the Congress, is now directly from the BJP
 kabhi dilli kii purv siem shila dikshit ke bahaane puri congress ko gherne vaali aam aadmi party kaa focus ek saal main badla he
 The aap's dispute with the bjp-led central government is well known
 centre ke bahaane dilli police or uparajyapal najeeb jang bhi aadmi party ke gusse kii bali chadhate rahete hai
 Dissatisfied with Delhi Police and administrative officials, the Kejriwal government called both Police Commissioner BS Bassi and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung as agents of the BJP
 kabhi kejariwal ke kareebi or unki aawaaj rahe yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan bhi unke khilaaf khadey ho gaye
 Both leaders opposed Kejriwal's policies and the party showed him the way out
 kabhi jisam aadmi partiko congress ne bijepi kii bi-team kaha tha vahi AAP ab bijepi ke liye sabase badi raajnneetik chunauti ban chuki he
 Whereas BJP and AAP are in dispute over administration in Delhi, in the coming year, in the Punjab elections, BJP is expected to face a tough fight with AAP
 punjab main AAP apane pair majboot kar rahi he or uske nishane par bijepi-akali dal gathbandhan he
 In the midst of these two battles, the Congress is nowhere to be seen
 kejariwal ke dost:anna hajaare ke andolan se alag hokar arvind kejariwal ne jab 'raajnneeti kii safai' ke liye jhaadu uthaai to unka dost koi nahin tha
 There were only a few people who were included in the party's executive or party volunteers
 lekin dilli main AAP kii aitihaasik jeet ke saath baaji palati or doston kaa kaaravaan badhata gaya
 The list of Kejriwal's friends is now long
 kabhi jis lalu prasad par kejariwal aag ugalate the ab unke saath wo manch saajha karte or gale milte najar aate hai
 Among Kejriwal's special friends, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar topped the list
 centre ke khilaaf kai muddon par in teenon kii gahari dosti dekhne ko mili he
 Revenge Goal: Aam Aadmi Party started politics with a campaign to change politics and remove corruption, but soon started walking on the same pattern of politics in which all are going on
 kranti karne ai AAP kaa lakshya ab raajnneetik rup se majboot hona or sarkaar chalaanaa he
 Currently, Kejriwal and the party's target is Punjab elections in 2017
 punjab main unki koshishdillijaise chamatkaar ko dohraane kii hogi
 For this, the party has already started fielding

 11 deaths in Burari, Delhi stunned everyone
 lekin aahista-aahista rahasy, anumaan, ashanka, tantra-mantra se dhanki is kahani ke kai sire pakad main aane lage hai
 The biggest evidence and witness is the register, which tells the inside story of Burari's murders
 sutron ke mutabik buraadi ke ghar main hui ek saath 11 maut kaa shaq ab parivaar ke chote bete lalit par aa kar tik gaya he
 The registers, diaries and other evidences found in the house indicate that Burari's Bhatia family was destroyed forever due to tantra-mantra
 darasal jo kuch beeti shanivaar or ravivaar kii darmiyaani raat ko hua uski bhoomika aaj se kai saal pehle banani shuru ho gai thi
 Leaving Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, Lalit's father Bhopal Singh died due to his hard work and business in Delhi
 parivaar kaa sabase chota betaa hone kii vajah se lalit unke behad kareeb tha
 Apparently, the biggest shock of the father's death also reached Lalit, which steadily deepened over time
 phir jaise itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha ki kuch saal pehle lalit kii aawaaj ek haadase main chali gai
 Despite long treatment, Lalit's voice did not return
 pita kii gaiyr maujuudagi or bol naa paane kii vajah se lalit tuutane laga, lekin isi bich ek ajeeb baat ghatane lagi
 Lalit started claiming from 5-6 years ago that he saw his father Bhopal Singh
 usase baaten bhi karte hai
 One day again what happened that no one expected
 lalit kii khoi aawaaj waapas laut ai
 Lalit gave full credit to the recitation and his religious faith for returning his voice
 pehle se ati dharmik rujhaan kii uski patni tina ne bhi uskaa saath diya
 After returning the voice, Lalit began to see his father constantly
 wo unke adeshon ko sunne or maanane laga
 The impact of the father on him was such that he began to take out his voice too
 lalit kaa daawa tha ki mrit pita bhopal singh uske jariye puure parivaar se sampark main hai
 According to the police Lalit kept writing every order of his father in the registers which have been recovered from the house
 bhaatia parivaar ko bhi lalit ke in ahsaason par andhaa bharosa tha, isliye wo lalit ke bataae anusaar hi kaam karte the
 One day Lalit's father also ordered him to meet the family
 ek register main lalit ne pita kaa hawala dete hue likhaa he, 'main kal yaa parason aauungaa, nahin aa paaya to phir baad main aauungaa
 Fine was writing everything written in the register
 wo pita se milane ke baad ab isi register main bhagwaan se milane kii bhi baat likhane laga
 All things were written as if father Bhopal Singh were writing
 register main aage likhaa tha, 'tumhen pataa he ki bhagwaan kabhi bhi hamaare ghar main aa sakate hai isliye puri taiyaari rakho
 'lalit has also written everything on the page on a page of the register about what the Bhatia family did between last Saturday night and Sunday
 'aakhri samay par jhatka lagegaa, aasmaan hilegaa, dharti hilegi
 But don't you worry, make the chanting fast, i will save you
 jab pani kaa rang badalegaa tab neeche utar janaa, ek duusare kii neeche utarane main madad karnaa
 You will not die, but you will achieve something big
 ' shaayad yahi vah aadesh tha jise puraa karne ke pher main puure parivaar kii jaan chali gai
 According to sources, Fine was suffering from mental illness
 medical science main ise shared psycotic disorder yaa diluzan bhi kehete hai
 This is a kind of disease
 isamen koi apana marane ke baad bhi dikhaai or sunai dene lagata he
 Such people again want to make their close friends feel the same
 medical science main iskaa ilaaj he
 Lalit instead of visiting psychiatrists took refuge in Babas
 patni ne bhi saath diya
 There was probably no one who could give Lalit the right advice at the right time
 vakt badhane ke saath hi lalit kii beemaari bhi badhati gai
 The family members started to listen to him even more
 yahaan tak ki apni bhanji kii shaadi naa hone par usne vishesh puja kii to uskaa rishta tay ho gaya
 During the search of the house, the police found several diaries and registers
 inamen 200 pannon kaa wo register sabase ajeeb he, jo poojasthal par rakhaa hua tha
 It began writing on 27 May 2013, which closed in between
 lekin iske baad phir 2015 main register main kuch baaten likhi gayi
 From January this year, various types of things were written in the register
 policeko pataa chalaa he ki lalit ye baaten likh kar register poojasthal main rakh detaa tha or register main likhi baton ke hisaab se hi is parivaar ke log apni dincharya yani routine tay karte the
 Now, seeing the constant entry in recent times, it is clear that Lalit was more than suffering from this particular type of mental illness these days

 The question is not whether there has been development in Gujarat or not
 sab sweekaar karte hai
 i accept that there was development in Gujarat

 Gujarat has the highest number of Muslims in government jobs
 ye aapaki sarkaar ke aankade hai or aap unka khauf dikhaate hai
 Jayaram: In the broad economic situation, Muslims are also better
 jab sachhar cameti kii report ai thi
 Then i did the analysis
 karnataka, kerala vagairah main overol behatar tha, to musalamaanon ko bhi hua
 But when it comes to Maharashtra, there was no development compared to South India
 main aapako ek sawaal puch rahaa hum
 How many of the 182 mlas of Gujarat are Muslims
 amit shah:gujarat kaa chunaav aa rahaa he yaa desh kaa aa rahaa he
 Election is coming for the country
 desh kii janata 10 saal ke upie shashan ke aadhaar par nirnay karne ja rahi he
 Their leader, their work will be sought for answers
 jairam ramesh:chunaav prachaar main ham in sab sawaalon kaa tagada jawaab denge
 On the question of SIT investigation of Gujarat riots
 jairam ramesh:bari karte hue bhi court ne yahi kaha ki mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 But criminal involvement cannot be denied
 amit shah:jakia jaafaree cese main esaiti ne saaf saaf kaha ki prosicute karne laayak kuch nahin he
 Jafri has alleged
 aath maamalon main
 In which there were major accidents
 unhone kaha ki puraa shadyantra he
 He alleged that big officials, ministers and cms of the state machinery are involved
 is esaiti ko banane main, uskaa kaaryakshetra tay karne main gujarat sarkaar kaa koi role nahin he
 The report goes to the Supreme Court
 report main likhaa jaataa he ki prosicute karne laayak saboot nahin he
 The court says that file in the right court
 ise chelange bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 After this, the decision came in the lower court
 usamen bhi modi ji bari ho gaye
 But the Congress is still raising the issue
 ise hi ham dhruvikaran kehete hai
 But this will not avoid the issue of scandal, inflation, inflation
 plis muddon par aa jaaie
 The public has moved beyond the Hindu Muslim issue
 magar aap abhi bhi vahiin atake hai
 Jairam Ramesh: The real agenda is yours
 ye jidipi kii baat to mukhauta he
 Amit Shah: If on the basis of performance, one party has got the maximum mandate, then it has got BJP
 sawaal (amit shah se): kanoon kachhari ek taraf, maanavtaa ek taraf
 Whoever did what
 jisaki bhi galati
 But does not Narendra Modi have this responsibility as the Chief Minister
 ki ek baar danga peediton se milen
 Shah: When the riot happened, Modi ji visited eight Muslim camps and seven Hindu camps
 us vakt raahat shivi main jitne bhi minurity cameti ke log the sabase mili
 Talked for three hours
 iskaa record he
 But the propaganda is being carried out
 iske liye to artiai kii bhi jarurat nahin
 i will make it available to you
 jairam:or unke offis se teen kilometre dur gulberga socity he
 Riot is happening there
 amit shah:aap galatfahami main ji rahe hai
 It is thirty kilometers from the office
 or rahi camp kii baat, to vah dange ke baad banaae gaye
 Question (from Jairam): On 2002 you get furious
 magar 84 ke dangon par bataaie kisko sajaa mili? jairam ramesh:84 ke dangon kaa koi samarthan nahin kar saktaa
 There was massacre
 indira ji ko kaha gaya tha, aap apane suraksha bal badaliye
 They did not change
 2002 ke dangon kaa vichaardhaara ek dwesh kaa vichaardhaara tha
 Amit Shah: Rajiv Gandhi himself said that a big tree falls
 tab dharti mil rahi he
 Big tree means Indira ji
 or dharti matlab sikh
 Jairam Ramesh: Our president apologized at the Golden Temple seven-eight years ago
 Question: But justice was not given Jairam Ramesh: Yes, that is the right question
 magar modi ke khilaaf koi sajaa hui kya
 a case is going on against Maya Kodnani
 amit shah:or unhen sajaa hui
 The matter happened in Gujarat itself
 aap bataaen sajjan kumaar or jagadish titalar maamle main kya hua
 Jairam Ramesh: If there is a punishment from the court, you will not survive
 modi ne to kabhi maafee bhi nahin maangi
 Amit Shah: Modi ji has repeatedly said that if a crime has happened, then just forgiveness will not work
 siarpisi ke tahat maamla darj hona chahie
 How Congress works jab 84 kaa narsanhaar hua, to manmohan singh jo us vakt vitt mantralay main kaam karte the
 Caught him and asked for forgiveness
 jairam ramesh:manmohan singh ne 2005 main sadan main maafee maangi
 Amit Shah: What difference does it make
 nyaay to nahin mila na sikhon ko
 And the issue is that the election will be on the performance of the UPA
 chunaav chaahe dhruvikaran par ho yaa vikaas ke muddon par
 Your defeat is certain
 hamaare upar aarope bhi lage hai
 The court also investigated
 magar aap to discus hi nahin karnaa chaahate
 Allegations on himself
 janata ke sawalsawaal (jairam se): kya aap aashwaasan denge ki 84 dangon ke gunahagaaron ko sajaa milegi
 Court has just given date? Jayaram: Yes, Punishment Milegswal (from Amit Shah): What is Modi's future plan for Muslims? Shah: My party believes in the development of everyone
 jab gaanv main bijli pahunchati he, pani pahunchataa he, to phayda sabko miltaa he
 Hindu and Muslim too
 main nahin chahta ki vikaas hindu yaa musalmaan ke aadhaar par
 We do not want the government to run according to religion
 sawaal (jairam se): log abhi rahul gandhi ke vichaar diguest nahin kar pate
 How will we do in 2014? Jairam ramesh-rahul Gandhi is two years younger than Kejriwal
 yuva netaa hai 
 Marathoner of politics
 vah 100 meter daudane nahin aae
 We are currently contesting the 2014 election
 sanghathan main badlaav kii vah jo baat kar rahe hai
 Don't just look at it from the perspective of this election
 aage tak kaa plan he
 We recognize that in many places the organization is weak
 kiran kher kaa sawaal, jairam ramesh se:meri ek iltijaa he
 Manmohan Singh apologized for 84
 sonia or rahul ne maafee nahin maangi he
 You say that justice is not available from the lower courts of Gujarat
 dilli ke loar court se kise insaaf mili
 At least decide the compensation for them
 itane bure haal main rah rahe hai
 Jairam Ramesh: i absolutely agree
 muaavja or insaaf milanaa chahie
 this is wrong
 ham par kalank he
 84 was wrong
 2002 galat tha
 i would do what is in my hand
 vilamb hua he
 Justice has not been received
 amit shah:mitron, ek jamaana tha, jab jansangh or bijepi sushasan prashasan kii baat karte the
 We were not ruled then for comparative studies
 panchayat se sansad tak congress thi
 Now this is not the case
 chah saal centre main sarkaar chali
 We have been partners in power in 17 provinces
 aaj janata ke saamne donon partiyon kii parformens he
 Leaders of both parties are also available
 meraa aaj tak ke jariye desh se yah aagrah he ki aap ye tay karen pradarshan ke aadhaar par ki satta kise milani chahie
 As far as the government of 10 years of UPA rule
 har morche par vifal rahi
 On the issue of corruption, i would say that the government has never been so corrupt since the constitution was created
 kolgate, 2ji spectrum, westland helicopter, adarsh, kaamanwealth
 Friends are so confused in this government that three such programs will fall short
 har ghotaale main sieji kii report or anushansa maujuud he
 Electricity, Petrol, Gas, Diesel
 jairam ramesh ke mutabik camershal baaten hai
 Food and drink items, which have become expensive, are in front of the public
 sarhadon kii suraksha, mahilaon kii suraksha, har jagah vifal rahi he
 As Shri Krishna said, victory is victory
 upie ke liye ek hi baat kahi ja sakati he
 Fail is fail ham shriman modi ke netritv main chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 We have presented them to the people
 congress bhale hi na bole
 But Rahul Gandhi is from the Congress
 tulana karuunga to jairam ji aitraaj karenge
 We have made him a candidate
 ek saadhaaran kaaryakarta se piem candidet tak pahunchane vaala, barambar janadesh paane vaala rajaneta hai
 Question (from Amit Shah): You are accused of misuse of Tantra
 snupaget kaa maamla aayaa
 The worry is whether Amit Shah and Modi, if they come to Delhi, do not think that citizens will be monitored using the system
 ye sahib koun he?amit shah:jis tarah se puri dangon kii raajnneeti narendra modi ke ird gird bunane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Ultimately, nothing came out of the country's highest court
 mujhe jabaran encounter main fansaane kii koshish kii gai
 Nothing came out
 isi tarah snupaget ke liye ek judishal kamishan hamane banaaya
 i want to tell the people of the whole country from this forum
 jis din report aegi
 In this too, nothing will come out except publicity
 sarkaar ke har norms ke hisaab se kaam hua he
 Question (from Jayaram): You will believe that Modi is acquitted in the charge sheet
 jairam:amit shah ne karpshan ke maamalon main sieji kii report kaa zikr kiya
 Many reports also came on the Gujarat government
 state petroleum corporation par report aae
 They should not be double standard
 amit shah-koi sarkaar court ko karrwai nahin kar sakati
 If Modi had done anything wrong then your NGO Brigade would have followed us
 jairam ramesh- bijepi aarope lagaati thi ki sibiai congress beuro of investigeshan he
 He was disappointed that his name did not appear in the charge sheet
 ab ye janata ke saamne aarope kaise doharaaenge
 Amit shah-cbi did not favor
 pehali chargeshit par court ne para viz remark maange hai
 The CBI did not file an answer thereon
 sawaal (amit shah se): snupaget main jo tepperecorder saamne aae
 Whose voice is it in? Amit Shah: When the Judicial Commission will call me and i will go and speak
 kamishan kii maryaada he, isliye baahar kuch nahin kahuunga
 Question (from Amit Shah): Why is it that even after 84, the Sikh community has faith with the Congress
 kai baar punjab main hamaari sarkaar bani
 But why did Muslims not join BJP on the same lines? kya isliye ki aapkaa adarsh hindu raashtra he, jisamen musalamaanon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Golwalkar ji wrote in the book, Hindus of the country should learn lessons from Hitler
 is par aapkaa kya kahana he?amit shah:maine golwalkar kii kitaab padhi he
 Nowhere else did we write such a question, this time only Modi ji's government is going to be formed with the vote of Muslim brothers

 He spoke to KCR over the phone and talked about supporting his candidate

 The NDA split! The nda's two oldest ally parties, the Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena, are angered by JDU MP Harivansh, nda's nominee for Deputy Chairman in the Rajya Sabha
 darasal, akali dal ko ummid thi rajyasabha main endie kaa upasabhapati kaa ummidavaar unka hoga
 Explain that Naresh Gujral's name from the Akali Dal was in the news, but at the last moment the BJP made JDU MP Harivansh a candidate, which has caused resentment in the Akali Dal
 jise lekar punjab ke purv upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal kii adhyakshata main akali dal ke sansadeey dal kii baithak kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal ke ghar par hui

 Himachal will vote in a single phase on November 9 but the counting of votes will take place on December 18
 matdaan or matganana ke bich 40 dinon ke antar ko lekar congress ne sawaal khadey kiye the
 It is believed that the voting in Gujarat will take place before December 18 and the two states will have the same vote counting simultaneously
 congress kaa aarope he ki gujarat main chunavi vaadon or ghoshnaaon ke liye sarkaar ko mauka dene ke liye tarikhon kaa elaan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 The Election Commission's reasoning was when Chief Election Commissioner Achal Kumar Jyoti was asked why he was not declaring the election schedule of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh together, breaking the tradition, his reply was that the counting of votes in both the states would be on the same day i
e
 December 18 
 ayog kaa ye bhi kahana he ki himachal pradesh main barfbaari se pehle matdaan karaane ke liye 9 november kaa din tay kiya gaya he
 On the 2012 announcement of the Commission's connection, senior journalist Neelanjan Mukhopadhyay said that in 2012, election dates were announced in the first week of April and the election schedule for Himachal and Gujarat was announced simultaneously
 tab himachal main chaar november ko voting hui thi lekin matganana 20 disambar ko hui thi
 Voting took place in two phases in Gujarat and votes were cast on 13 and 17 December
 nilanjan ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi us samay gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 He had expressed unhappiness that the long electoral schedule would affect development work as the election notification continued
 piem modi is samay 'van nesan, van ellection' campan kii vakaalat karte rahe hai, uske mul main bhi unki yahi soch he
 However, counting of Himachal and Gujarat together will be held on 18 December
 congress ne EC ke faisle par jataai hairanicongress ne chunaav ayog ke faisle par hairaani jataai thi or kaha tha ki ayog kaa nirnay samaj se pare hai
 If elections are delayed in Gujarat, then the party in power will have time to make baseless and unnecessary populist announcements to woo the public which may affect the election results
 bachaav main bijepi ne kya kaha?haalanki bijepi pravaktaa saiyad jafar islam ne chunaav ayog ke faisle kaa bachaav kiya tha or kaha ki donon rajyon ke chunaav saath ghoshit nahin ho sakate kyonki himachal vidhansabha kaa satr 7 janvari ko khatm hoga jabaki gujarat kaa 21 janvari ko hoga
 He said that any government can make populist announcements even earlier
 uske liye antim dinon kaa intjaar karne kii jarurat nahin rahati
 The great batsman Viv Richards did not see Sir Don Bradman playing, but he does not see any better than Sachin Tendulkar in all the batsmen of the current round
 richards ne kaha ki maine don ko khelte nahin dekha lekin jitne ballebaajon ko maine dekha he, unamem sachin tendulkar se behatar koi nahin he
 He said that if there is any better batsman than Sachin, he probably has not come yet
 richards ne tendulkar ko bryan lara, riki ponting, jaak kallis or apane daur ke sunil gavaskar tathaa javed miyandad se bhi behatar banaaya
 Brandman had scored 29 centuries in 52 Tests in his 20-year career
 tendulkar 22 saal ke karier main ab tak 99 antarrashtriya shatak bana chuke hai
 Richards said that Tendulkar's biggest advantage is that he has completed a career circle by recovering from pain, failure, fatigue and injury
 iske baavjood vah lagaataar acha khel rahaa he
 He is the complete package and also the most respected cricketer
 unhone westeindies daure se baahar rahane ke tendulkar ke faisle kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 Richards, who came to a publicity program of Jani Walker here, said that Tendulkar is 37 years old, he is not as young as before, so his decision should be respected
 unhone kaha ki use bakhubi pataa he ki uske liye kya thik he
 He also said that Tendulkar's presence would have been an inspiration for the youth on the Caribbean tour
 richards ne kaha ki yuvaaon ke liye use khelte dekhnaa yaadgaar anubhav hota
 How he prepares for the innings, how he enhances it, how he adapts himself to the situation
 yah behtareen anubhav hota
 He said he was overwhelmed by the love he received from the Indian cricket community

 Pakistan's army is busy building bunkers on the outskirts
 jammu kii seemaa ke us paar bane hai 150 kilometre se zyada lambey bandha or unke peeche lagaataar ban rahe hai cement ke pakke bunker
 However, the way the terrorists have been infiltrating these areas, it seems that the terrorists will not hide in place of the soldiers in these bunkers
 kai sawaal ab bhi ansulajhe hanakhir sarhad par yun bunker banane kaa matlab kya he
 Why are high and tall walls being erected on the border
 kya seemaa ke us paar koi badi taiyaari chal rahi he
 Will the preparation be of any special purpose under the wall
 aise kai sawaal ab bhi ansulajhe hai
 But a lot is clear before the eyes
 saaf ye ki in banksron ko chhipane ke liye banaaya ja rahaa he
 On normal days, the army remains here
 lekin koi hairat nahin hogi agar yahaan kabhi aatanki bhi aakar chhipane lagen
 This border is 180 kilometers long
 jammu-kashmir ke kathua se akhnur tak faili lambii seemaa
 It is believed that this is the easiest route for border infiltration
 pehle bhi kai baar aisi hi ghuspaith ho chuki he
 There is no preparation for war in the guise of Bandh
 Now the question is that what Pakistan needs is pucca bunkers
 usase bhi zyada bada sawaal he ki oonche bandha kaa kya matlab he
 Is there any conspiracy behind them? mumbai hamalon ke baad se is kaam main kaaphi teji ai he
 Now the security forces are also worried that the bunkers should not be used for attack
 bhartiya sena kii taraf se in nirmaanon kaa virodh bhi kiya gaya, lekin wo nahin maane
 Pakistan claims that these are just for security
 lekin bhartiya suraksha balon kii bhi najar har harakat par he
 Precaution is being taken that there is no preparation for any war under the cover of Bandha
 satark rahanaa behad jarurikarib 200 kilometre lambey faile is sarhad ke zyaadaatar hisson par biguef hi tainaat he
 From the beginning of the 1990s, there was infiltration from this border
 uske baad se hi bharat ne sarhad par fensing kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 After this, from the year 2003, the boundary and bunkers were made in Pakistan border
 khufia jaankaree ke mutabik, pakistan ne ab tak 150 kilometre se zyada bandha or unki aad main kai darjan bunker bana liye hai
 According to intelligence sources, the work of building bunkers in Pakistan has already been in progress
 lekin sij fire ke dauraan bhi sarhad ke us taraf pakke bunker banate rahe
 Obviously, this is one, which is very important to be cautious about
 sarahadi ilaakon main rahane waalon kii maane, to khauf unki jindagi kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 He says that till a few years ago, the awe was with bullets and now what is going on behind the bandha and bunker, it hurts
 dar to is baat kaa he agar seemaa-paar se firing shuru ho gai, to phir kisi ko ghar se nikalne kaa mauka tak nahin milegaa
 Pakistan is engaged in new preparations under the guise of ceasefire
 khauf sirf pakistani sena kaa nahin he
 Fear is also there of those nefarious people who are giving shelter to terrorism
 surakshabal ke adhikari bhi is baat ko maanate hai ki sarhad ke paar aatank ke kai training camp chal rahe hai
 In Pakistan, the work of bunker and bandh is being done openly when there is a cease-fire between the two countries
 naa jane kya he iske peeche kii manshaa
 But it is clear that the preparation is in full swing

 bijepi ne uparashtrapati pad ke liye kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ke naam par antim muhar laga di he
 But exactly one and a half months before today when Naidu's name cropped up when the Vice President election was in full swing, Naidu in his own style rejected the news outright
 agar taarikh kii baat kii jaae to, 31 may ko jab naidu seup-raashtrapati ummidavaariko lekar sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha tha ki vah naa to raashtrapati bananaa chaahate hai, or naa hi uparashtrapati vah usha ke pati hokar hi khush hai
 At that time, Naidu in his familiar style had rejected the candidature
 darasal, usha venkaiya kii patni kaa naam he aurnaidune apni patni ke naam kaa udhaaharan dekar khabaron par viraam laga diya tha
 Apart from Naidu, the names of several other leaders including Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Najma Heptullah and Sharad Yadav were being mentioned in the race
 haalanki somvaar ko apane naam ke elaan se thik pehle naidu ne kaha tha ki party agar unhen naam par vichaar karti he to unhen party kaa faisla manjuur hoga
 Not only this, in the news even then, the name of Venkaiah Naidu was being claimed because the BJP has been losing its political ground in the south, especially in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 aise main party naidu par daanv laga sakati he

 jo bhi ho, ab bijepi ne naidu par daanv lagaakaar dakshin bharat ke logon ek sandesh dene kii koshish kii he
 Naidu will now face UPA candidate Gopal Krishna Gandhi in the vice-presidential election

 bharat ne 2007 main bermuda ke khilaaf 413 ran or 2010 main gwalior main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 401 ran banaae the
 In this match, Sachin Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 200 runs
 sahvaag ke alaava gautam gambheer ne 67 or suresh raina ne 55 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 Sehwag hit 25 fours and seven fours in his 149-ball innings
 unhone gwalior main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 200 ranon kii naabad pari khilne vaale sachin kaa sarvocch vyaktigat yoga kaa ricard dhwast kiya
 In this innings, Sachin hit 25 fours and three sixes in 147 balls
 sahvaag ne kisi ekadivasiy pari main sarvaadhik 25 chauke lagane ke sachin ke ricard kii bhi barabari kii
 He is the only Indian cricketer to have scored a triple century in Tests and a double century in odis
 apni is shandaar pari ke dauraan sahvaag ne ekadivasiy maichon main 8000 ran ke aankade kaa bhi paar kiya
 Sehwag, who came to start the innings with Gambhir, started showing his color with the first ball and added 176 runs for the first wicket with Gambhir
 holkar main yah pehle wicket ke liye ab tak kii sabase badi saajhedaari he
 Earlier, Robin Uthappa (86) and Rahul Dravid had added 166 runs for the first wicket at this ground against England in 2006
 baharhaal, gambheer 67 gendon par 11 chaukon kii madad se 67 ran banane ke baad durbhagyapurna tareeke se ran out hue lekin isse sahvaag ke ran banane kii gati par koi asar nahin padaa
 Raina, who came on the wicket to support Gambhir in place of him, started to play Sehwag with the same enthusiasm with which Gambhir was playing
 yahi kaaran tha ki donon ne duusare wicket ke liye 17
 Add 140 runs in 3 overs
 raina kaa wicket girane tak bharat ke khate main 316 ran jud chuke the
 Washing off his failure in this series, Raina scored 55 runs off 44 balls with the help of six fours
 rabindra jadeja (10) ne niraash kiya lekin rohit sharma (27) ne tej pari kheli
 Rohit hit three fours on 16 balls
 viraat kohli 11 gendon par teen chaukon kii madad se 23 ran banaakar naabad laute
 In this way, the Indian team was able to score 400 runs in odis for the fourth time and its highest ever score
 agar aapke ghar ke saamne sadak itani oonchi ban jaae ki ghar kaa daravaaza band ho jaae yaa itnaa chota ho jaae ki khidki lagane lage to kya aap bardaasht karenge
 Will you tolerate if you have to go to the house after bathing and washing utensils, dirty water after storing it in bucket several times and leaving it outside the house and throwing it away at an empty place somewhere in the locality
 kya aap us bharat mahaan kaa gungan karenge, jiskaa aajkal tivi ke har duusare sho main india-india kiya jaataa he
 After all, how long will we force our citizens to live such a life
 maine bina pani ke itani sankhya main duube hue makaanon ko nahin dekha he
 If you are not sure, then you will definitely watch prime time tonight on NDTV India at 9 pm
 kaise logon ke ghar bina pani ke dub gaye hai
 Due to the drainage and sewer not being used, the rainwater accumulated
 saal-dar-saal us par khadnja bichaate rahane ke kaaran sadak oonchi hoti chali gai
 So high that the roof of every house went down the road or was so submerged that now people get out of their house by putting stools and benches
 gali-dar-gali main makaan sadak se neeche dub gaye hai
 The houses have been destroyed due to the sinking of houses
 bahut kam logon ke paas ab paise hai ki ve neeche ke makaan ko bharkar uske upar makaan bana len
 Most of the people work as waste, labor, timber workers, run rickshaws, and even live by selling chaat-peanuts
 aise logon kii koi awaz is chunaav main sunai nahin detii he, lekin netaaon ko inaki sankhya maaloom he, isliye aap dekhenge ki dilli main jitne bhi hording lage hai, unamem har duusare par inhen se jude mudde hai
 But there is no discussion of these issues
 koi eemaandaar bahes nahin he
 Seeing the clean road of cement, you will say that development has taken place, but this is to be understood
 aakhir yah koun sa vikaas tha, jiske tahat itnaa nahin sochaa gaya ki sadak bana dene se kisi ke ghar kaa daravaaza band ho saktaa he, ghar dub saktaa he
 Road water now falls in the house
 colony main kahin bhi pani kaa conection nahin he
 They all have hand pumps in front of their house
 dilli jaise mahanagar main handpump kii maujuudagi bataa rahi he ki hamaari sarkarein sabko pani dene main fail rahi hai
 Where the hand pump is installed, drain water is coming out from there
 nateeja yah hua he ki ganda pani zamin ke neeche ja rahaa he or handpump se upar aa rahaa he
 i saw many women filling the bucket in water and waiting for two hours to let the dirty part of the water sit down so that they could do some household work
 aurate pine kaa pani lene ke liye do-do kilometre paidal chalakar jaati hai
 Many traders selling water have come to the area, but they do not have the basic right to water
 auraton kaa sara jivan pani ke aasapaas kaid hokar rah gaya he
 a few days ago Sanjay Gandhi Colony of South Delhi went
 vahaan pani kii samasya ne auraton ko duusari tarah se jhukaa diya he
 Large drums of chemicals are filled with water
 zaahir he, ise auraten apane sir par uthaakar nahin le ja sakati hai, lihaaza unhen drum ko neeche giraakar dhakka maarna padataa he
 One woman said that it takes several hours to take her home by beating the drum
 maine us mahila ko dekha ki jaise hi drum ko dhakke maarane ke liye jhuki, saamne se motorcycle aa gai
 He had to stand up, then after pushing away, someone else came in front
 is tarah se jhukate-uthte vah drum ko apane ghar tak le gai
 Therefore, writing slogans on hoarding - that everyone will get a house, get water - is not enough
 in coloniyon main rahane vaale logon kii sankhya saath lakh bataai jaati he
 There is strength of numbers in a democracy, but these people are helpless
 vidhayak-parshad or sthaneey gundon kii dhamkee ke kaaran unke saath rahane ke liye majaboor bhi hai
 They know that if votes are reduced from this street then houses will be demolished
 nigam ke tanker se pani nahin milegaa
 Their issues are not resolved just by writing slogans
 sadak to bani he, magar uske kaaran ghar duube hai
 Now, if you have to provide sewer and water connection, then you have to break the seven to eight feet high road and put a sewer line
 yah sab ek jatil kaam hai or vaaki eemaandaar niyat kii zarurat he
 Any government in its priority has to take it ahead of slogans
 dilli ke liye bhi acha he ki bharat kii rajdhani ke saamaanya nagarikon ko sammanit jivan jeene kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 The new CEO and MD of Infosys, Salil Parekh, will get Rs 16 crore as salary
 yah selary company ke purv siio vishaal sikaa se kaaphi kam he
 Infosys independent board member Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said that Salil will get a package of Rs 16 crore
 isamen unki fiks selary 6
 5 crores will be Rs
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik shaw ne bataaya ki sall ko 6

 75 karod rupee kaa vairieble pe paane ke hakdaar rahenge
 According to him, 3 to Parekh
 25 karod rupee kii stock units or 13 karod rupee ke vaarshik equity grants milenge
 Infosys appointed Salil Parekhko as the new CEO of the company in December last year
 unhone vishaal sikaa kii jagah lee
 Vishal Sikka resigned from his post after a dispute with the founders of the company
 sikaa ke company chhodane kii ek sabase badi vajah company ke sansthaapak narayan murti kii taraf se lagaataar hamale kiye janaa rahaa
 There was a controversy over the Rs 42 crore salary paid to the coin
 salil paarekh ko 5 saal ke liye siio pad kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalenge
 The annual package that Parekh is getting is equal to one third of the coin's package
 vaivaahik jivan main kamyaabi ke liye danpati ke bich ek-duusare par bharosa hona bahut jaruri he
 This trust is also determined by whether they have had physical relations with any other person before marriage
 naitikta kii kasuti par khare utarane par danpati ke bich bharosa or pyaar, donon beshumaar hone kii sambhaavna bahut bad jaati he
 a research has revealed that people who have less number of sexual partners before marriage have better relations with their wife
 isaki vajah yah he ki aise log apni patni se zyada pyaar paane kii tamanna rakhte hai or unhen zyada pyaar dete bhi hai

 When the Indian cricket team picked up the ICC World Cup in 1983, the whole nation began to rejoice, then the foundation of this dream was laid
 us samay main nau saal kaa tha or milon dur baithe hue televijan par apni team ko jashn manaate dekhakar mujhe garv mahasoos hua tha
 When i started playing cricket, from then on i used to dream of picking up the World Cup and getting ready to prepare myself months before the tournament started
 1996 kaa vishwa cap isliye khaas tha, kyonki bataur sah-mejabaan yah toornament ham apane desh main khel rahe the
 But his hopes of ending his fairytale collapsed in the semi-final against Sri Lanka
 us shaam hotel lautne kaa rasta bahut lanbaa lag rahaa tha or ham vah match baar-baar apane dimag main khel rahe the
 We were regretting thinking how we had made such a big mistake in identifying the Eden Gardens pitch, due to which we finally lost
 vishwa cap jeetne kaa aglaa mauka 2003 main aayaa, jab team junun or jazbe se bhari thi
 We reached the final big match for the match against Australia
 us samay tak team se sabhi khiladiyon ne sirf dusron ko hi vishwa cap final main hissaa lete hue dekha tha
 This was a tremendous opportunity for us
 lekin ek baar phir pehle ballebaaji karne kaa hamaara faisla vinaashkari sabit hua or riki ponting ne apni sabase acchhee van-de pari khelte hue hamen apane balle se chaaron khaane chitt kar diya
 Then after the disappointment of 2007, the 2011 World Cup was played in India and its final match was held in Mumbai, which will always be special for me
 hamaari taiyaari asal main toornament ke bahut pehle se hi shuru ho gai thi
 This preparation also included very small things, such as the promise of losing 3 kg weight for each and thus becoming a more fit team
 harek is vaade par khara utraa
 i own 3
 8 kilo vajan kam kiya or team ke mere saathiyon ne bhi apane-apane lakshya puure kiye
 i must admit that i had dreamed of lifting the cup, but i had not even imagined what the victory celebrations would be like! It was such a glorious night, which India had seen just once before — what men, women, all were dancing on top of cars and nobody was even objecting
 1983 ke vishwa cap main bharat kii jeet ke baad mujhe ek bachche kii tarah apana naachna yaad he
 From this week, the Indian team will start their campaign to save their World Cup title
 ve apane paaramparik pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf maidan main honge or ise dabaav se bharaa match kahana baat ko kam karke kahana hoga! pakistan ke khilaaf vishwa cap kii shuruyaat karnaa team ke kai khiladiyon ke liye nayaa tajurba hoga
 a well-made plan may also have to be changed in critical combat
 2003 main viru (virendra sahvaag) or maine bataur openar pari kii shuruyaat karne kaa faisla kiya tha or yah bhi tay kiya tha ki ham donon main se koi ek aakhir tak khelegaa
 i took the first strike to defeat the triple challenge of Waqar (yunus), Wasim (akram) and Shoaib (akhtar)
 maje kii baat yah ki aisa hua nahin or ham tej gati se ran banaate chale gaye
 In the second innings the body language of the team changed and we became more aggressive
 bharat or pakistan ke bich khele gaye sabhi muqablon kii yah dilachasp khaasiyat rahi he, tabhi se jab 1992 ke vishwa cap main maine unka pehali baar saamana kiya tha
 The match will always be remembered for that famous feud between Kiran More and Javed Miandad, in which Miandad made the famous frog jump to intimidate Moray and stop him from giving further instructions to the bowlers! This was the first time since the start of the World Cup, when both teams were playing against each other in this tournament, and India won this first match of many more matches ahead
 1996 ke game main aamir sohail ke saath venki (venkat prasad) kii jhadap ke baad maidan main tanaav charam oonchai par pahunch gaye
 The match was also a sweet memory for India, with Navjot Sidhu scoring a strong 93-run knock and then Ajay Jadeja scoring 45 off 25 balls to take India to 287 in 50 overs
 yah match sabase zyada venki ke haathon sohail ke out hone ke liye yaad kiya jayega, khaskar isliye ki sohail ne boundry kii taraf apana balla laharaate hue venki ko kaaphi buree-bhalee baaten boli thim
 After this incident and then taking the wicket of Sohail, the whole team got into tremendous action and we held the match in our fists
 phir 1999 ke vishwa cap main england main bhi kuch aisa hi hua
 Here we played the match against Pakistan in the Super Six match
 isamen venki ne ek baar phir 5 wicket liye or ham 47 ranon se match jeet gaye
 The 2011 victory was also very special, as the entire team contributed together in this victory and Zaheer took very important wickets in one of his great spells
 umr gul or viru ke bich hui takkar bhi joardaar thi, jab hamane pehle ballebaaji kii or duusari pari main hamaare sabhi gendbaajon ne milakar shandaar yogadan dete hue pakistan ko out kar diya
 i can say in advance that there will be a very tough match on 15 February, because there is definitely something in this match, which forces both teams to perform at their best, especially if Pakistan's performance in the warm-up match If we consider it as a signal, then it is even more certain
 bhartiya team itnaa jabardast dabaav hoga ki uski kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati; toornament kaa pehla match hoga or donon padosi deshon ke bich maidan par or maidan se baahar kaaphi purana itihaas rahaa he
 But apart from India's opener match, there will be some more spectacular matches in this World Cup, which will be interesting to watch
 is vishwa cap main sabaki nigahen sabase zyada agar kisi par hongi, to vah e
 B

 South Africa is the team that would like to take full advantage of their recent form this time
 aalochakon ne un par kuch beja tohamatein madhi hai
 Success in this tournament has impressed India on many occasions, but South Africa has always played more or less amazing cricket in all World Cups, whether it was Kepler Vessel's team in 1992 or Graeme Smith in 2011, and now lead in de Villiers Be a team playing in main ummid karata hum ki newjiland, england or dakshin africa duusari tiimon kii bajaae phaayde main rahengi, kyonki ve apane jane-pahachaane wicket par khel rahe honge
 But among all the teams, i think South Africa is the team that needs to be watched (apart from Australia), because they are playing very good cricket and they have some very good all-round players
 asian deshon main bharat ke paas bhi aise hi kaabil khilaadi hai
 Although he has struggled under Australian conditions in the last two months, he should not be dismissed completely
 main yah hakeekat jaanata hum ki bataur captain em
 s
 dhoni or unke utsaahi khiladiyon main chizon kaa rukh mode dene kii or apni haar se teji se sabak seekhney kii rahasyamay kaabiliyat he
 Among the rest of the Asian teams, i am confident that Sri Lanka will perform very well
 main samajhataa hum ki (kumaar) sangakaara or (tillakaratne) dilashaan kaa hona kisi bhi team ko khatarnaak dhar de detaa he
 Last month he was on a tour of New Zealand, this will also be important for his campaign
 cricket premiyon ko bharat se dher sari ummiden hai or ve ummid karenge ki team vishwa cap main har match jite
 i would only hope that the team enjoy this experience, fight their lives and focus their attention on the game itself; Then victory will automatically follow them
 vishwa cap kaa sapana kuch aisi cheez he, jo ek cricketer kii ankhon se tab tak ojhal nahin hota he jab tak ki vah vijeta team kaa hissaa na ban jaae
 But i would only advise them to enjoy the game to the fullest, and play it openly, do not let the heat of the atmosphere dominate you and do not let the fun of the game get gritty under any circumstances
 main itnaa kahuunga ki team tajurbe kaa majaa le, apni jaan ladaa de or khel par puraa dhyaan lagaae, phir jeet to khud unke peeche chali aegi
 a statement has been issued by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Ayodhya Sadbhavana Coordination Committee Chairman Amarnath Mishra on the allegation of Salman Nadvi, a member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, for dealing with the Ram temple
 is bayaan main saaf kiya gaya he ki amarnath mishra naa to shri shri ravishankar ke pratinidhi hai or naa hi unki sanstha se jude hue hai
 The Art of Living has made it clear in its statement that Amarnath Mishra is not a representative of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
 jari bayaan ke mutabik art of living ne kaha he ki ham sabhi kaa khule dil se swaagat karte hai or sabko saath lekar chalate hai
 The institution welcomes anyone who wishes to cooperate in resolving the Ayodhya issue peacefully
 gurudev (shri shri ravishankar) sabhi pakshon ko shaamil karte hue iskaa samaadhaan karnaa chaahate hai
 From the very beginning our stance is quite clear
 shri shri ravishankar ke anusaar nyaayalay ke baahar ayodhya vivaad kaa 'saude yaa sangharsh se nahin, sauhaard se hal nikaalnaa hoga'
 It is important for the unity and peace of the country that the people of both the communities sit together and resolve it in an atmosphere of mutual brotherhood
 yah bahut khed kii baat he ki kuch nihit swaarthee tatv is acchhee pahal ko naakaam karne ke liye or avishvaas paidaa karne ke liye har prakaar ke pantare laga rahe hai
 Amarnath Mishra accused Salman Nadvi that he has spoken of a deal on Ram Janmabhoomi
 jisamen unhone 5000 karod or 200 acre jameen ayodhya main maangi thi
 However, Nadvi had termed all these allegations baseless and said that she had not spoken of any such deal
 sakshi maharaj ne bhi amarnath mishra ke aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataate hue shri shri ravishankar ko saamne aakar sachai bataane kii baat kahi thi
 In a statement issued by the Art of Living, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar while flaying Amarnath Mishra said that he is neither his representative nor has anything to do with his organization
 koyale se hira kabhi bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 Provided, there are intentions for this
 kaam karne kii ichhashakti ho
 There is the ability to work hard and the officers are allowed to take decisions
 isamen ab shaq kii gunjaaish isliye nahin bachi he kyonki is baat kaa saboot mil chukaa he
 Remember
 jab mahalekha niyantrak (kaig) ne kaha tha kikoyale khadaanon kii nilameese sarkaar ko kam se kam 1
 86 lakh crore rupees have been lost, there was a lot of uproar
 ye baat tab kii he jab centre main upie 2 kii sarkaar thi
 At that time, the ministers of the government had exaggerated the cag's claim as a statistic
 kya koyala bhi sone jaisaa phayda de saktaa he? centre sarkaar ke afasaron kii ek choti si team ne ise sach kar dikhaaya he
 How much and who benefits? The Central Government has so far raised two lakh crores from the auction of coal mines
 ye rakam 30 koyala block kii nilaamee se mili he
 The government has a total of 1 excluding royalty
 76 lakh karod kii raashi ugaah liye hai
 These amounts and royalties from the coal auction will be given to six states
 kaise mili kamyaabi?kendriya koyala rajya mantri piyush goyal ne is kaam kaam kii jimmedaari koyala sachiv anil swaroop ko saunpi or phir ek nominated athurity banaai gai
 Vivek Bhardwaj, the most junior officer in the ministry, was chosen for this task
 joint secretary bharadwaj ne central secretareat ke afasar esake shahi ko athurity main diarector ke taur par liya, saath hi kol india se asthai taur par do karmchaariyon ko bhi shaamil kiya
 In less than five months, this team of only four people worked from ordinance making to auction, and also kept the government's side in 15-20 cases going on in the court
 sabase badi baat to ye rahi ki inamen se kisi ne bhi is dauraan ek din kii bhi chuttee nahin lee
 What is the story of profit? In September last year, the Supreme Court canceled 214 coal blocks and within a month the government brought the ordinance
 is adhyadesh ko taiyaar karne main afasaron kii is team ne paanch din lagaae
 About one and a half months after the ordinance was passed by the cabinet, the complete ordinance of the ordinance was prepared
 afasaron ke liye badi chunauti to ye thi hi, kaam bhi mushkil tha kyonki kyonki desh main pehali baar koyala block kaa i-ocshan kiya ja rahaa tha
 Tender rules and documents were made by this team of officers
 kansaltesan paper jari kiya gaya, suzav maange gaye
 Transparency remained the entire process online
 mana jaataa he ki naukarshahi jo kahati he, netaa vahi karte hai
 The second system is that bureaucracy does what the leaders say
 ferj kiijie
 What will happen when bureaucracy and leadership work together? The result is in front of you
 ye koyale kii kahani nahin, naukarshahi ke kaamkaaj or leadership ke iraadon par uthte sawaalon kaa behad khamoshi se diya gaya ek khubasurat jawaab he
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday and expressed concern about the safety of Kashmiri students
 unhone jammu kashmir ke alaava anya rajyon main pard rahe kashmiri chaatro kii suraksha ko lekar grahamantri se unke awaas par mulaakaat kii

 On Thursday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the country stood apart from all his earlier speeches and such occasions
 aamtaur par lambey vyaakhyaan dene vaale pradhanmantri modi kaa bhaashan 38 minute main samaapt hua or kathanak kashmir tak simata rahaa
 gahe-baghe mentioned Jammu and Ladakh but during this period neither did he appear to give a slogan to strengthen the Hindus nor raise the issue of rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits
 unke bhaashan ke nayak bhi kashmiri the, udhaaharan bhi kashmiri the or sandarbh bhi kashmiri
 In terms of diplomacy and politics, Modi's speech was neither for his fans across India nor for his countrymen
 pakistan kaa yaa bharat main pakistani gatividhiyon kaa to pradhanmantri ne naam tak nahin liya
 Modi was actually trying to address both the Kashmiri people and the world community through this speech
 kam se kam sandesh to ye hi tha
 Modi's speech for the world community and Kashmir had two messages
 donon hi vishwamanch par saraahe jane vaale shabd hai- devlepment or demokrasi
 In his speech, Modi continued to emphasize on strengthening democracy, creating a new political generation and various types of elections, or trying to show the future images to the people in the dream world of development
 ye donon hi baaten sakaaratmak hai kyonki isamen naukariyaan hai, behatar jivan str he, samashtibhav he, behatar sansaadhan or vyapaar he, majboot loktantr he or logon kii pratibhagita kaa aahvaan he
 But it is not that Modi's strategy is completely new
 modi kaa yah ek testad formula he to abtak safal hota aayaa he or kam se kam unhen to yah ummid he hi ki kashmir ke maamle main bhi ye sahi sabit hoga
 This formula of Modi's panacea formula can be understood by reversing the politics of the last few years
 avadharana sidhi he
 Whichever state has its foothold, first identify the political domination and the strongest looking political houses there
 phir unki jaateey or saamudayik satta kii simit aabaadi ke alaava baaki logon ko avasar, shakti or samanta ke naare ke saath jodo
 In this way, Modi has been winning the victory till date by drawing a big line parallel to the earlier lines
 udhaaharan se samajhnaa chahen to uttar pradesh kii ore dekhen
 Mayawati is the political identity of Jatavs
 vahiin akhilesh yadav emwai (muslim-yadav) sameekaran ke uttaradhikari
 But their penetration among other castes was limited
 modi ne baaki choti-choti jatiyon ko ekikrut karke in kshetreey dalon ke varchasv ko haashie par laa diya
 Here, Modi has used the appeasement of dynastic and casteism or a particular sect against the first line to gather majority in his court
 bihar main yahi sthiti lalu prasad kii jati aadhaarit raajnneeti kii hui he
 His MY equation was also a big line in state politics, which Modi has proved to be small by pulling a big line from him
 aisa mana jaataa rahaa he ki haryana kii raajnneeti main jaaton se alag hokar dhan kii ek paudh tak ropi nahin ja sakati
 But the manner in which the frozen families of Jat and Jat politics were marginalized from the state assembly elections to the two Lok Sabha elections, this has been possible only by this formula of Modi
 keval raajnneetik vipaksh hi nahin, bhaajapa se jude sanghathanon ke saath bhi aisa hua he
 What could be a better example than the Shiv Sena
 aaj shivasena kii chatapataahat ensipi yaa congress ke prati kam, bhaajapa se paidaa ho rahe khatre ke prati zyaada he
 Next bet is in Kashmir and now it is the turn of Kashmir
 modi apane bhaashan main ek kaam sabase zyaada karte nazar aae or tha kisi bhi jati, sampradaay yaa kshetreey pahchaan se upar uthakar bahumat aabaadi ko rijhaane kii koshish karne kaa
 Modi neither mentioned Kashmiri Pandits nor Hindu Muslims or Buddhists and Sikhs
 wo sabake liye naukariyon, vyapaar ke avasar, vishwastareey paryaton, cinema or khanpan, wajife or bhartiyon lekar aae
 He dreamed of bringing state employees and police on par with central employees
 yuvaaon ko bhavishya, pariwaron ko behatar jivan str, do pariwaron tak simit satta kii paristhitiyon main sabase liye raajnneeti main avasar modi kii is khaabida tasviir main shaamil the
 In Modi's speech, all these images of development have been surrounded by the families that have been in power for decades
 iraadaa saaf he, in raajnneetik pariwaron kii lakeer se lambii lakeer kheenchna or inhen jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti ke panne par haashie tak samet dena
 People love long lines
 wo lakiron main behatar takadir dekhne lagate hai
 But the streak in Kashmir is not only about family politics
 logon ke dilon main lakeer he kyonki unhen gahare ghaav jhelane pade hai
 Modi may have reduced the line of the houses of regional politics with his strategy, but the streak of the hearts of Kashmiris is long and the question here is not to get beyond that, to erase it
 modi ke raajnneetik jivan kii shaayad duusari sabase badi chunauti bhi yahi he

 (input ieenes se bhi) (also from input IANS) mantrimandal main NCP ko 14 va congress ko 12 mantri pad milengeshivsena ke khate main mukhyamantri ke alaava 14 mantri pad bhimaharashtra main shivasena ke netritv vaali gaiyr bijepi sarkaar banane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 The Shiv sena-congress and NCP have almost agreed to form the government
 haalanki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare or aditya thakare main se koun mukhyamantri banegaa yah tasviir abhi tak saaf nahin hui he
 Although Shiv Sena contested the election by advancing Aditya Thackeray, now the situation has changed
 bijepi se rishta khatm hone ke baad shivasena ab apane dhur virdohi congress or ensipi jaise raajnneetik dalon ke saath milakar sarkaar bana rahi he
 Running a government in harmony with politicians like Sharad Pawar and a strong opposition like BJP will be a big challenge for the new CM
 aise bani sahmatimaharashtra sarkaar banane ko lekar shivasena, congress or ensipi ke bich lagaataar baatcheet chal rahi he
 a consensus is being reached between the three parties on the Common Minimum Program (CMP)
 is formule ke tahat shivasena ko puure kaarykaal ke liye mukhyamantri pad milegaa, jabaki congress or ensipi ke ek-ek dipti siem honge
 Apart from this, NCP will get 14 in the cabinet, Congress will get 12 ministerial posts
 shivasena ke khate main mukhyamantri pad ke alaava 14 mantri pad kii sahmati bani he
 Formation of government in Maharashtra has been decided between Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP
 iske saath hi 'thakare parivaar' se mukhyamantri bananaa bhi tay he, lekin naam par sanshay ab ban gaya he
 The question is whether Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray himself will take over the reins of power or will Aditya be named as the third generation of the Thackeray family for the post of CM? Shiv Sena contested the assembly elections in the name of Aditya Thackeray
 isi ke maddenjar aditya mumbai kii varli vidhansabha seat se chunaav lade or jitkar vidhayak bane
 After the election results, the Shiv Sena is going to form a government with the Congress and NCP by breaking the 25-year-old relationship with the BJP for the post of CM
 aise main congress or ensipi ke liye aditya thakare ko siem banaae jane par sahamat hona mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Aditya Thackeray will also face a challenge It will not be easy for Aditya Thackeray to run a coalition government with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and veteran and experienced Congress leaders
 wo bhi tab jab bijepi jaisaa majboot vipaksh unke saamne hoga
 On the other hand, there is Narendra Modi government at the Center, from which Shiv Sena has already come out
 aise main aditya thakare jinka siyasat main abhi padaarpan hi hua he unke liye aage kii raah bahut hi chunauteepurn ho sakati he
 This is the reason why the Shiv Sena may be betting on replacing Aditya Thackeray as Uddhav Thackeray
 uddhav thakare sahyogi dalon ke saath behatar dhang se sarkaar chalaa sakate hai, ve bijepi jaise majboot vipaksh se bhi nibatna jaanate hai
 However there is also a screw here
 uddhav siem banate hai to bijepi ko sawaal khadey karne kaa mauka mil jayega ki unhone gathbandhan apni khud kii raajnneetik laalasaa main aakar hi todaa he
 Not only this, this will be the first time that the Thackeray family will leave the role of King Maker and take direct power
 aise main thakare parivaar par vipaksh sidhaa hamalaa karegaa, isse thakare parivaar or matoshri ke us rutabe main kami aa sakati he, jiske dam par shivasena kii raajnneeti chalati he
 This is the reason, who will be the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra? Political analysts are certainly not in a position to say anything about this
 aamir khan in dinon bechaini kaa shikaar ho gaye hai isse nijaat paane ke liye vah smoking kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 bollywoodlife
 com main chhapi khabar ke mutabik aamir khan kii bechaini kii vajah he film 'dangal'
 Yes, you heard it right but there was no digging that a well-known actor like Aamir Khan was nervous
 lekin site kii sutron ke mutabik, aamir ke saath aisa har baar hota he, jab bhi unki film relies hone vaali hoti he
 He starts feeling nervous before the release of each of his films
 aisa 'dhooma 3', 'pike' or film 'talash' ke dauraan bhi unke saath hua tha
 Aamir Khan quit smoking for the last time in January this year, after which he lost 25 kg and brought his body in shape for 'dangal'
 abamir kii film 'dangal'ke pre-relies daur se guzar rahe hai or aise main unki nervasness badhati ja rahi he
 This uneasiness has made him completely smoker, due to which he is not knowing how many cigarettes he is lighting
 din main kai baar kash laga rahe hai
 Aamir Khan just refrains from smoking cigarettes in front of son Azad because Azad does not like to drink cigarette of Aamir
 sutron kii maane to aamir jab bhi smoke karte hai to aaazaad unhen kamare se baahar jane ke liye kah dete hai
 One reason for Aamir Khan's nervousness about 'dangal' is also considered to be Salman Khan
 kyonki is saal salmaan khan kii restling par besd film 'sultan' blockbster hit sabit hui thi
 The film broke the records of all films except PK in terms of earnings
 isliye ab 'dangal' or 'sultan' kii tulana kii bhi khub charchaa ho rahi he
 The question in everyone's mind is whether the film based on Aamir's wrestler's life will be able to beat Salman's Sultan at the box office
 kahin yah sab charchaaen hin aamir kii bechaini kaa kaaran to nahin

 He said that neither there is an opinion in the government on the criteria of poverty line, neither the bank accounts of all the poor are open nor the Aadhaar cards have been made for everyone

 use lagata he ki ise aadha adhuraa lagu kar dene se hi log manhagaai, bhrashtachar, ghotaale or mahilaon ke saath kadachaar aadi kii baaten bhul jaaenge or uske paksh main matdaan karenge
 Describing it as a misconception of the Congress, he said that this alleged game-reversing scheme would prove to be the game of reversal of the Congress
 yah baat ab kisi se chhipi nahin he ki congress kaa khel ab kharaab ho chukaa he
 He is not going to benefit from plans to throw dust in the eyes of the poor
 ’shahanvaj ne kaha ki ukt tamaam kamiyon ke alaava garibon ke bank khaaton main rajsahayta kii nagdi ke sidhe antaran kii yojana ‘phool pruf’ (truti rahit) nahin he
