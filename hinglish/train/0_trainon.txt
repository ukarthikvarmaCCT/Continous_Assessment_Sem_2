 Viju is given the contract to kill Jaban police officer Karan i

 Sonu Sood, who is engaged in eliminating gangsters
 viju kii ek hi problem he
 If an old man speaks, the mind falls apart, but will Viju really kill Karan
 yahaan kahani main ek tivest he jo bataakar ham aapkaa mazaa kirkira nahin karenge
 'budha Hoga Tera Baap' is produced by director Puri Jagannath, who has made South's superhit film Pokiri
 pokiri ko rimek karke salmaan khan kii film wonted banaai gai
 That is why the editing of 'budha Hoga Tera Baap', Villain, is clearly reflected in the film's twist and turn

 This old man gives romance tips to youngsters but also beats them for molestation

 Although these recorded songs do not sound like original, they are fun to watch
 amitabh kii engri yangamain pasarnelity se match karte hue kai chutile dialogs likhe gaye jinhen sunakar aap hansate rahenge
 Sadly, the item number filmed on Raveena Tandon is missing
 amitabh or hema malini ko lekar bagban jaise seens garh die gaye jahaan film dhili nazar aati he
 Barring Big B, the other characters did not develop very strongly, not even Villain
 villen jitna majboot hota hero utana hi zyada strang dikhataa lekin film kii sabase badi khaasiyat he isaki intertenment value
 There is action, emotion, drama and comedy too
 'buddha hoga tera baap' ke liye meri reating he 3 star

 After this attack, petrol in India has become more expensive by two rupees

 Addressing government officials during the 'water Policy Workshop' at the Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal said that the use of privatization of the power sector was very unfortunate
 unhone kaha, ‘main is sawaal main nahin janaa chahta ki bijli kaa nijeekaran hona chahie tha yaa nahin, lekin aaj jab iskaa audit kiya gaya to is prayog par ek sawalia nishaan he
 In such a situation, there should be no privatization of water in the national capital

 The responsibility of government in education, water and health sector cannot be escaped from it
 unhone is maukey par varsha jal sanchayan par bhi jor diya

 For the Cricket World Cup, 30 potential players of Team India were selected
 cricket prashansakon kii ummiido se ulat yuvaraj singh, virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, harbhajan singh or jahir khan ko is suchi main jagah nahin mili
 There is only one question in everyone's mind, why did this happen to these senior players
 ham aapako bataate hai, isaki vajah
 
 
 1
 team main chune jane kaa pehla paimaana pradarshan hota he
 In the last two years, Sehwag has played 13 odis in which he averages 20
 23 rahaa
 At the same time, Gambhir scored 23 in 30 odis
 58 kii ausat se ran banaae
 These averages are extremely simple for any opener
 vijay hajaare toornament main donon khilaadiyon ne kul 6 match khele jisamen donon ne 1-1 ardhashatak jade
 In this tournament, Harbhajan Singh captained Punjab and got only 7 wickets in 6 matches
 yuvaraj singh ne bhi balle se koi khaas pradarshan nahin kiya, paanch maichon main 168 ran
 Zaheer had last landed in the IPL played in May this year
 fitness kii fans main aise fanse ki mumbai kii ranjai team main bhi jagah nahin mili
 2
 is baar world cap australia-newjiland ke maidaanon par khelaa jayega
 Not only New Zealand, but the cricket grounds of Australia are much larger than other grounds in the world
 aankade yahi bataate hai ki in maidaanon par boundry se zyada khel dabl or tripal kaa he
 That is, fielding emerges as an important aspect of the game
 aise main in paanch khilaadiyon kii umr or fitness unke chayan ke aade aa gai
 Sehwag, Gambhir, Zaheer and Harbhajan are less agile than the youth
 yuvaraj kii fielding par koi sawaal nahin uthta, par beemaari ne unhen bhi dhimaa kar diya he
 In such a situation, Dhoni cannot ignore this important aspect of the game
 sach yahi he ki unke paas koi or vikalp nahin tha
 3
 cricket un chand khelon main se he, jisamen captain kii bhoomika ahm hoti he
 Whether it is a decision on the field or the selection of the team
 2011-12 ke australia daure ke baad hi dhoni ne ishaaron main saaf kar diya tha ki bhavishya kii team india main senior khilaadiyon ke liye jagah nahin he
 This desire of Dhoni also got the support of the board, gradually the senior players retired and the young players became part of the team
 bhartiya team ko to pichley do-teen saalon main in khilaadiyon ke bina khilne kii aadat si ho gai he
 We won the ICC Champions Trophy without them
 gharelu sirijon main jeet kii lay barkaraar rakhi
 Despite the indications being clear, it seems meaningless to expect these five players to make a place in the team
 4
 If the Cricket Board had included these five players among the 30 possible players to keep the hearts of fans, then what next? aap apane dil par haath rakhkar puuchhie ki kya ye khilaadi antim 15 main jagah banane main kaamyaab ho pate
 You know the answer, of course not
 aise main yuvaaon ko mauka kyon na diya jaae
 After all, the future is the same and if they are not encouraged at this time, it might not be late
 aaj kii taarikh main safalataa kaa ek maatr mantra he
 
 
 Catch Them Young
 chaahe vah corporate duniya ho yaa phir cricket kaa maidan
 The one who showed confidence in the youth got success
 5
 This is how change happens
 ab aapane ghar ko hi le lijie
 As you grow older, your decisions have to be accepted by senior members of the household
 team india bhi isi phej se guzar rahi he
 At one time it was the era of these players, they made us world champions
 inkaa sikaa bolta tha, par ab paristhitiyaan alag hai
 The board has also agreed that now all faces are on young faces
 world cap cricket kaa aakhri toornament to he nahin, iske baad bhi khel jari rahegaa
 Through these arguments we do not want to tell that today's young players are better than Veeru, Gambhir, Yuvi, Bhajji and Zaheer
 hakeekat yahi he ki ye naa hote to ham 2011 main world champion shaayad hi ban pate
 The records also support this point
 pichley world cap main in khilaadiyon ne kul 40
 1171 runs at an average of 38 which includes two centuries
 in khilaadiyon ne kul 14 kaich pakade or 45 wicket liye
 But the future cannot be sacrificed for the sweet memories of history
 uttar pradesh ke mainpuri se ek dil dahala dene vaali khabar he
 Here, a girl burned a two-year-old innocent girl alive only because the girl's mother had accused the young woman of theft
 ilaaj ke dauraan aspataal main jahaan bacchee kii maut ho gai he, vahiin paanch saal kii maasoom bacchee is ghatana kii chashmadid bani he
 The police have registered a case against two people including the accused woman and started investigation
 ghatana thana vichhawaan ilaake ke bhojpur gaanv kii he
 It is said that Deeksha, the two-year-old daughter of Ahiwaran Singh, was playing with young children near her home on 23 July
 is dauraan ghar main koi bada maujuud nahin tha
 In such a situation, the 20-year-old girl, aka Baby, a resident of the village at the same time, reached the house of Ahiwaran Singh with a glass of oil in a bucket
 dekhte hi dekhte usne diksha ke upar mitti kaa tel udel diya or phir maasoom koag ke hawaale kar diya
 After the incident, there was a ruckus, and in a hurry, Ghyalabchi was taken to the district hospital, but the doctors referred him to Mini PGI Saifai
 jindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahi maasoom diksha kii ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho gai, vahiin uski ek paanch saal kii dost ghatana kii chashmadid bani he
 The special thing is that the child-turned-child Shabnam belongs to the family of the accused woman
 yuvati par lagaaya tha chori kaa iljaambataya jaataa he ki is vaardaat ke peeche badale kii bhaavana thi
 In fact, some time ago Deeksha's mother Anita accused the accused woman of stealing the coil
 anita ke mutabik, style ne kundal churaakar ek sunar ke yahaan 6000 rupee main girvee rakh die
 Panchayat sat after the matter was revealed
 panchayat main yuvati se 6000 rupee waapas dilaae gaye, jiske baad se hi style badla lene kii soch rahi thi
 However, for this she would fall to such an extent, no one had an idea

 Urmila Matondkar has now reacted in this matter
 urmila ne kaha 'mere khilaaf jo shikaayat darj karai gai he wo ekadam niraadhaar he
 This is a case of gross misrepresentation and the person who has lodged this complaint against me, he is a member of BJP and his motives are not right
 maine apane intervyuu main kaha tha ki bijepi dwaara hindu dharm ke naam par jo farji, baantne vaali or hinsak vichaardhaara ko failaayaa ja rahaa he, usase hamaare mahaan hindu dharm kaa niraadar ho rahaa he

 Railways have constituted a high-powered committee of senior officials to investigate the stampede incident at New Delhi railway station on Sunday
 bhagdad kii is ghatana main do logon kii maut ho gayi thi or 8 anya ghayal ho gayi the
 The three-member committee comprises additional member (commerce) Brij Mohan, additional member (civil engineering) SK Malik and additional director general of Railway Protection Force Northern Railway PK Mehta
 rail mantralay ke ek pravaktaa ne bataaya ki samiti se kaha gaya he ki vah jitna jald sambhav ho apni report saunp de
 The committee has started its investigation work
 sthiti kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue rail mantri mamata banerjee ke nirdesh par chaar sadasyeey samiti ke sthaan par varisht adhikariyon kii is teen sadasyeey samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 Although Mamata had announced the formation of a three-member inquiry committee earlier on Sunday, but shortly there was talk of forming a four-member committee of senior officials
 maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan ke liye rajyapal kii sifarish ko cabinet ne manjuuri de di he
 It was sent to the President for approval
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne jald hi is sifarish ko manjuuri de di or maharashtra main aakhirkaar raashtrapati shashan lagu ho gaya
 However, Shiv Sena has moved the Supreme Court against the Governor's recommendation of President's rule
 sutron ke anusaar maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke peeche mukhya rup se paanch aadhaar hai
 During the ongoing political deadlock in Maharashtra, on the basis of five major facts, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari sent a recommendation to impose President's rule
 maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish ke peeche paanch aadhaar-1
 Political deadlock persists in Maharashtra 2
 daawey ke baavjood shivasena samarthan ke patr nahin de saki‬ tathaa or adhik samay maanga
 3
 nesanalist congress party (ensipi) ne bhi or samay maanga‬
 4
 vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht ke aarope lagane lage
 5
 congress uhapoh kii sthiti main bani rahi
 According to the sources, on the basis of the above facts, the Governor had recommended the Governor of Maharashtra, Bhagat Singh Kosari to impose President's rule
 isko kendriya cabinet ne manjuuri de di
 Later, the President also gave the green signal and Maharashtra came under President's rule
 udhar rajyapal kii is sifarish ke khilaaf shivasena supreme court pahunch gai he
 Shiv Sena says that the Governor did all this at the behest of BJP
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki rajyapal ne party ko sirf 24 ghante kaa samay diya
 It is being told that the issue of Maharashtra was discussed in the cabinet meeting held before the Prime Minister's visit abroad and the recommendation of the Governor was accepted
 shivasena ne supreme court main rajyapal dwaara maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish karne ke faisle ko chunauti di he
 The Shiv Sena has said that it had sought three days to seek letters of support from the NCP and the Congress, but the governor rejected
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki rajyapal ne bijepi ko yah bataane ke liye 48 ghante kaa samay diya ki kya vah sarkaar bana sakati he, lekin samarthan patr hasil karne ke liye shivasena ko sirf 24 ghante kaa samay diya
 The Shiv Sena alleged that the governor acted in haste at the behest of the BJP to deny him the opportunity to form the government
 shivasena ne yachika main kaha he ki rajyapal ne is maamle main fast farvad tareeke se kaam kiya he
 The Governor's 11 November decision not to give time to the Shiv Sena is unconstitutional, arbitrary, illegal and a violation of the right to equality
 shivasena ne supreme court se aagrah kiya he ki vah sarkaar banane ke liye use vaazib samay dene kaa nirdesh jari kare

 desh main cricket ke alaava duusare khelon kii jab bhi baat hoti he, to badahaali, paise kaa abhaav federation or khel mantralay kaa sahi tareeke se kaam na karnaa, khilaadiyon kii andekhi, acchhee facility kaa nahin hona
 
 
 Such things are heard
 kya sara dosha federation khel mantralay or adhikariyon par madhnaa sahi he
 In India, the game like tennis is marginalized because no one is paying attention to it or there is another reason for it
 
 Why is there an emptiness in Indian tennis? The history of Indian tennis has been very glorious
 ramanathan krishnan, vijay amritraj, ramesh krishnan, liender pes, mahesh bhupati, sania mirza or rohan bopanna jaise diggaj khilaadiyon ne apni maujuudagi kaa khub ahsaas karaayaa he
 Yet sports lovers find a bit of emptiness in Indian tennis
 kuch adhuraa lagata he
 Why is this incompleteness after all? Why he could not achieve the position in Indian tennis that was expected
 1996 atlanta olympic ke singles muqablon main liender pes ne bronj medal jitkar sansani machaa di thi
 It is as if a new era has started in tennis
 lekin 21 saalon main abtak koi bhi bhartiya tennis khilaadi olympic main apana jalawaa nahin dikhaa sakaa
 In the Grand Slam doubles and Mix doubles matches, the Indian players kept pairing with the player of another country
 lekin aapas main ek-duusare ke saath khelte samay manmutav saamne aata rahaa
 Is this the reason for emptiness in tennis
 kya he bhartiya tennis ke pichhadane kii vajah?bade khilaadi hone ke baavjood kyon bhartiya tennis pichhadaa hua dikhaai detaa he
 When Aaj Tak
in spoke to Olympian and international player Vishnu Vardhan on this issue, he said that there is no help from the Federation and the government for the players
 khilaadiyon ko apni jeb se paisa lagaakar travel karnaa padataa he
 Many times there is not even money to give to coaches and physios
 jisaki vajah se khilaadi pichad jate hai
 Is the Ministry of Sports and All India Tennis Federation really keeping their eyes closed? Because of which Indian tennis is lagging a bit
 wo rigelt nahin aa rahe jisaki ummid kii jaati rahi he
 How right is it to blame the Federation and the Ministry of Sports? All India Tennis is responsible for increasing the atmosphere of tennis in the country and for creating new players
 federation ke ek adhikari ne apana naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki kisi par tohamat laga dena bada aasaan hota he
 The federation has organized tournaments for junior, sub junior, national and international level
 paisa pani kii tarah bahaya, lekin in toornament ko kabhi positive tareeke se nahin liya gaya
 It has always been said that this is the work of the Federation
 use yah karnaa hi he sahi kaam ko kabhi nahin saharaaya gaya
 Then due to the absence of sponsors, losses were also incurred
 jiskaa khamiyaja khilaadiyon ko uthaanaa padaa or dosha federation par madh diya gaya
 In a population of 125 crore, only two thousand youngsters play tennis all over the country
 sports athurity of india or khel mantralay ke paas ve saare sansaadhan maujuud hai jisase desh main kai tennis khilaadi banaae ja sakate hai
 The apathetic attitude of the government can also be considered as a major reason for this emptiness in tennis
 star khilaadiyon kaa asapas main takaraav ne bhi bhartiya tennis ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 What have the Indian tennis associations done so far? The failure of the All India Tennis Federation and some former players against it formed the Indian Tennis Association in the year 2013
 jiskaa makasad khilaadiyon ko sahi fecility dena or desh main tennis kaa vikaas karnaa tha
 The association had veterans like Mahesh Bhupathi, Joydeep Mukherjee, Somdev Burman
 pichley chaar saalon main association ne ground level par kitna kaam kiya isaki jaankaree kisi ke paas nahin he
 In such a situation, it is understandable for the players to blame the government and the federation
 nijee swaarth ne bigaada khelkya vaaki main bhartiya tennis ke pichhadane main ol india tennis federation, sarkaar or khilaadiyon kaa dosha hai
 Actually, Indian tennis could not progress due to the right synergy and personal selfishness
 khilaadi, federation, khel mantralay main ekajutata nahin dikhi
 Because of which Indian tennis could not achieve the place it was supposed to be
 kisi bhi khel ko upar laane ke liye kuch buniyadi baton ko samajhakar ek saath chalane kii jarurat hoti he, tabhi kisi bhi khel kaa vikaas hota he

 Facing heavy international pressure, Pakistan has banned Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud Dawa and two other terrorist organizations, including the dreaded terrorist organization Haqqani Network, and also banned Saeed, the main conspirator of the 2008 Mumbai attack, from going abroad
 Has given taliban dwaara peshawar main army skool par aatanki hamale main 136 chaatro samet 150 logon ko goliyon se bhune jane ke baad pakistan par achche or bure aatankwaadiyon ke bich antar khatm karne ke liye pad rahe antarrashtriya dabaav ke bich yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 State Department spokeswoman Tasneem Aslam confirmed the ban in his weekly press conference on Thursday
 hakkaani network or anya aatankwaadi samoohon ke khilaaf yah karrwai america ke baari dabaav ke bich kii gai he, lekin asalam ne kaha, ‘pakistan ne yah faisla sanyukt raashtra patibaddhtaon ke tahat kiya he
 Not under pressure from any other party, including John Cary (US Secretary of State)
 ’unhone bataaya ki bain hue samoohon ke bank khaaton main len dein par bhi pratibandh laga diya gaya he or said kii videsh yatraaon par roak laga di gai he
 Radio Pakistan has given this information
 america raashtrapati baraak obama kii 26 janvari ko ganatantr diwas samaaroh main bataur mukhya atithi shaamil hone ke liye bharat yatra se kuch din pehle hi pakistan ne yah faisla kiya he
 Earlier a Pakistani official said that the decision to ban JUD and several other groups was taken by the government several days ago and the Home Ministry was asked to decide the modalities for implementing the decision
 mantralay ne said ke do samoohon jeyudi or falaah e insaaniyat foundation (exef) samet charampanthi or aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main unki sanliptata ke liye unhen pratibandhit sanghathanon kii suchi main daalate hue in adeshon kaa paalan kiya
 The FIF is the premier charitable organization of Pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba, which has been banned by the US
 said par ek arab dollar kaa inam ghoshit tha or vah pakistan main khuleam ghumta tha or aksar saarvajanik reliyon ko sambodhit karata tha jinamein vah bharat ke khilaaf bhadakaau bayaan detaa tha
 Pakistan has been consistently saying that there is no case against Saeed and as a Pakistani citizen he is free to roam the country
 bharat baar baar pakistan se said ko 2008 ke mumbai hamalon main uski bhoomika ko lekar usase poochtacha karne ke liye use bharat ko saunpe jane kii maang karata aa rahaa he
 166 people were killed in the Mumbai attack
 adhikari ne bataaya ki jin anya pramukh samoohon par bain lagaaya gaya he unamem hakkaani network bhi shaamil he jisaki afghanistan main kai bheeshan hamalon main bhoomika rahi he
 The US has long been demanding action against Haqqani and JUD
 pratibandh ke baad in sabhi samoohon kii sampattiyon ko sil kar diya jayega
 The United Nations Security Council called lashkar-e-taiba a masked organization of the JUD after the Mumbai attacks
 uske baad se sanyukt raashtra or america ne jeyudi ke kai netaaon par pratibandh lagaae hai
 The Haqqani network, founded by Jalaluddin Haqqani, is accused of bombing the Indian embassy in Afghanistan in 2008 in which 58 people were killed
 iske alaava usne kabul main saal 2011 main america duutavas hamale ko anjaam diya or saath hi afghanistan main usne kai bade trek hamalon ko bhi anjaam dene kii koshish kii
 US and Afghan officials have repeatedly said that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI has secretly supported the Haqqani network to increase its influence in Afghanistan
 pakistan is aarope se inkaar karata he
 The US gave the group the status of a terrorist organization in September 2012
 pakistan ne 2002 main jeyudi par pratibandh laga diya tha lekin aatankwaad main samooh kii sanliptata ke sabooton ke abhaav main court ne baad main is pratibandh ko hataa diya
 The group has been banned by the US, European Union, India and Russia as a terrorist organization
 input bhashaa se Team India captain Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that even though Sachin Tendulkar may be one step away from completing centuries in international cricket, the cricket batsman's night before the World Cup final to be held at his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium will not be disturbed
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘1989 main padaarpan karne ke baad se pichley 21 baras main puraa bharat unase ran banane kii ummid kar rahaa he

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘usne kaaphi kuch hasil kiya he or use kuch or karne kii jarurat nahin he
 He will get a good night's sleep and will do his best to get on the field
 ’test cricket main 51 jabaki ekadivasiy maichon main 48 shatak jamaane vaale tendulkar ne toornament ke lig charan main england or dakshin africa ke khilaaf shatak banaaye lekin mohali main pakistan ke khilaaf semifinal main vah 85 ran par out hokar tisare shatak se chook gayi
 Dhoni said, 'I have always said that it is not a matter of outcome, you cannot control the outcome
 aap sirf apni taiyaari ko niyantrit kar sakate ho or agar aap acchhee taiyaari kar rahe ho or agar yah aapkaa din he to aap badi pari khelkar apni team ko jita sakate ho
 There is no point in thinking about what you are going to achieve
 ’unhone kaha, ‘vah jis tarah kaa vyakti he, vah hameshaa maidan par utarkar apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karata he
 It is his love and passion for cricket
 vah jab bhi abhyaas yaa match ke liye aata he to shat pratishat prayaas karata he
 Praising this legendary batsman, Dhoni said that Tendulkar's attitude has not changed in the last 21 years
 unhone kaha, ‘vah behtareen vyakti he
 His attitude has not changed in the last 21 years
 adhikansh log ruchi kho dete hai
 God has created Sachin to play cricket and he has been doing this for the last 21 years and will continue to do so for the next few more years

 Reacting to the Mumbai special court's decision, Chidambaram told reporters, "the court has convicted some of the accused
 usne do aropiyon ko bari bhi kar diya he
 This shows that the court is independent, fearless and honest in its decisions
 ’unhone kaha ki yah ek khulaa mukadmaa he jo kanoon ke anuroop chalaa or aropiyon ko apana bachaav karne kaa puraa mauka diya gaya tha
 He said, 'I am satisfied that within a year, we were probably able to decide against some of those accused in large numbers in a very complex trial
 ’ grih mantri chidambaram ne kaha, ‘yah mukadmaa is baat ko spasht karata he ki bharat ek aisa desh he jahaan kanoon kaa shashan chalata he
 He said that the criminal case can only go step by step and the prosecution has been able to prove the culprit in this case throughout the year
 ’ chidambaram ne pakistan ko lekar sandesh diye jane ke bare main puche ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘yah faisla pakistan ko yah sandesh he ki unhen bharat main aatankwaad kaa niryaat nahin karnaa chahie

 It has been decided to increase the pension for the families of the employees who have died before completing 7 years of service
 pension kaa yah sanshodhit niyam sarkari karmchaariyon par lagu hoga jinamein kendriya sashastr bal ke karmi bhi shaamil hai
 The Central Government has made a change in Rule No
 54 of the Central Civil Services (pension) Rules, 1972 and this change will come into effect from October 1, 2019
 badale hue niyam ke mutabik 7 saal se kam kii seva ke bich hi nidhan ho chuke karmchaariyon ke parijanon ko agle 10 saal karmchaaree kii antim selary kaa 50 fisadi hissaa pension ke rup main diya jayega
 The first rule was that if a worker who completed more than seven years of service died, his family would have received 50% of the last salary as pension, but if the death of an employee of less than seven years of service
 Had his family received only 30% of the employee's last salary as monthly pension
 carmik, lok shikaayat or pension mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha he, 'sarkaar yah maanati he ki aise karmchaaree jinka naukari ke shuruaati daur main hi nidhan ho jaataa he, unke parivaar ko pension zyada rate se dene kii jarurat he, kyonki shuruaati daur main karmchaaree kii selary kam hoti he
 Now, according to the revised Rule 54, the family of those government employees who die within seven years of joining the job will also be given an increased rate, a pension of 50% of the last salary for the next 10 years

 isi tarj par ab duniya main motobot dastak dene vaala he
 Although it will not be transformed into a car, but it will definitely compete with a great racing champion with a superbike
 aapako bataa den ki is motobot ko duniya kii mashhoor company yamaha ne 44ventokio motor shoke dauraan pesh kiya he
 It is currently in the development stage and the company is planning to make it even better
 yah bhi padhein: maaruti kii premium hazbek Baleno lonchacompany ne iskaa ek video jari kiya he jisamen kaha gaya he 'I am Motobot and i was created to surprise you' (main ek motobot hum or mujhe aapako hairaan kar dene ke liye banaaya gaya he)
 The video also shows Motobot performing a stunt
 company is motobot se motogp ke racing circuit main 193 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se superbike chalaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 If the company launches it successfully then it can take on the champion in the racing world
 yah motobot insaan kii tarah hi super bike chalaata he
 It applies brakes on time, reduces speed more and it also reduces gear when speed is slow
 company dwaara jari press relies main ise yamaha research ourdeveopment projectaka ek part bataaya gaya he, jise company lagbhag 200 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se superbike chalavaanaa chaahati he
 See how it applies the accelerator and brakes, however, looking at the two supports next to its wheel, it seems that this motoboto needs to be improved and it will be interesting to see if this motorboat will be used for professional racing or not
 If done, it will be nothing short of a nightmare for racing champions

 After this, all the auspicious planets have a role in it

 Saturn, Rahu and Ketu generally interfere with Mars functions
 mangal jab karaab ho to mangal kaary hona ek chunauti ho jaati he
 When auspicious tasks are done easily at home? - Auspicious tasks are done easily when Mars is favorable
 - chandramaa kii shubh dasha hone par bhi mangal kaary hote hai
 - Even when auspicious in the horoscope of Jupiter, Mars is a combination of works
 - saadhe saati yaa dhaiyya ke utarane par bhi shubh kaaryon kii sthiti banati he
 - It happens even when blessed by a saintly Mahatma
 kab ghar main mangal kaary nahin hote?- jivan main shani kii dasha chalane par mushkil aati he
 - Mars actions do not happen when Rahu in the horoscope is bad
 - brihaspati ke ashubh hone par bhi mangal kaary nahin hote hai
 - Even after regular bickering afflictions in the house, the auspicious actions do not occur
 - ghar ke mukhya dwaar ke karaab hone par bhi aisi sthiti banati he
 Ways to get Mangal work done at home? - Make a place of worship in the house and worship worship regularly
 - ghar main saptaah main ek baar samuhik puja jarur karen
 - Minimize discord strife at home
 - ghar ke mukhya dwaar par niyamit bandanvaar lagaaein
 - If the sound of regular bhajan kirtan comes in the house, it would be better

 krishi aay par kar ke vivaadaaspad mudde ko uthaate hue jalaan ne bhartiya paristhitiyon main krishi or chote kisaanon ke mahatv kaa ullekh kiya

 jalaan ne kaha ki teen saal main hamane jo hasil kiya he vah oonchi vruddhi or nichali mudrasphiti he

 jab anbhavi khilaadi form nahin hota he uskaa chayan australia team main nahin hota he
 That is why the Australian team performs well
 bharat kii raajnneeti main bhi yah formula lagu hona chahie
 New leaders should be given tickets instead of those who are not in the form
 yah jo puraane netaa he unhen tennis kii tarah non plaing captain bana dena chahie jo baahar baithkar salaah dete rahe
 Given the experience, if you give a ticket, then this tired leader will not be able to perform well in the election
 yah kabhi nahin sochna chahie ki agar baap bada netaa he to betaa bhi chunaav jeet jayega
 If that were the case, Sunil Gavaskar's son Rohan Gavaskar would have been a big player
 film star ke bete bhi bade film star ban jate
 Like cricketers and film stars, leaders will have to perform themselves or else people will reject
 ab congress par aate hai
 The Congress is becoming a VIP party
 congress ke kai bade netaa is party ko apana sampatti maanate hai
 They think he is the party's contractor
 party unki vajah se chalati he
 But they should bear the brunt of public everything in a democracy
 rahul gandhi ne shanivaar ko CWC kii baithak main kaha ki chidambaram ne kaha tha ki agar unke bete ko tikat nahin mila to wo party chhod denge
 Kamal Nath said what is the use of being my Chief Minister if i cannot get my son a ticket
 chhindwara mere parivaar kii seat he
 Rahul Gandhi said that Gehlot Saheb stayed in Jodhpur for a week
 magar bete ko jitwa nahin sake
 When a party leader is blackmailing, he should be expelled from the party immediately
 rahul gandhi ko yah kade kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 Kamal Nath says Chhindwara is the seat of his family
 paariwarik seat kya hota he ? kya kamalnath ne is seat ko banaaya he
 Bought this constituency? People give such answers and beat such leaders
 ashok gahalot rajasthan ke mukhyamantri he unako rajya ke har jagah janaa chahie tha lekin hafton tak wo apane bete ko jitaane ke liye jodhpur main rahe iskaa matlab gahalot sirf apana bete ko ke liye zyada gambhir the jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi haar gaye
 Could not save your seat
 log yah bhi kahata he sindhiya hameshaa raja jaise vyavhaar karte hai
 It is a big deal if a man walking behind Scindia takes a selfie to beat Scindia
 amethi se rahul gandhi kii haar bhi badi haar he
 Rahul Gandhi worked hard this time as the president of the party
 rahul gandhi ne sirf apane kshetra main nahin ghumaa wo lagbhag sabhi rajyon main prachaar kiya apane ummidavaaron ke liye vot maanga
 He performed his duty as Chairman
 ashok gahalot kii tarah rahul gandhi agar sirf amethi camp lagaae hote to shaayad wo jeet jate
 But the public defeated Rahul Gandhi and the public should respect the decision
 is chunaav kuch aise criminal bhi jeet gaye hai jinako jeetna nahin chahie tha
 In democracy, the public is the boss, but the public should always see what is the back ground of the person who is voting? There are so many criminal cases against him but nobody pays attention to this thing
 phir jab netaa kaam nahin karata he to janata roti he
 The people of Delhi defeated Atishi and won Gautam Gambhir
 meraa maananaa he janata kaa yah nirnay sahi nahin he
 Atishi has been working hard for many days
 dilli ke ajukeshan ke liye aatishi ne kaaphi acha kaam kiya
 Gautam Gambhir is a good cricketer but he has no experience in politics
 agar cricket ko dekhte hue aap kisi ko saansad bana rahe hai to janata yahaan galat he
 Hansraj Hans also won, he also has no experience in politics nor has he done anything for Delhi
 sirf narendra modi ko piem banane ke liye logon ko kisi ko bhi chunakar sansad bhejnaa nahin chahie kyonki yah loktantr ke liye sahi nahin he
 In Delhi, the Congress did not ally with the Aam Aadmi Party and gave tickets to the old leaders
 agar congress gathbandhan kar leti to sabhi netaaon ko tikat nahin mil paata
 The Congress believes in contesting elections more than winning
 shila dikshit ko tikat mili
 Should Sheila Dixit get a ticket? yah sahi he ki shila deekshit acchhee netaa he lekin har cheez kaa ek samay hota he
 It was not right to stand for election at the age of 81
 is maamle main bijepi kaa 70 saal zyada umr waalon ko netaaon ko chunaav main na utaarna vaala nirnay sahi he
 People like Mahabal Mishra, Arvind Singh Lovely, Ajay Maken got tickets
 arvind singh lavali pehle congress the, congress chhodkar bijepi chale gaye the phir congress main waapas aaye to unhen tikat mil gaya
 People argue that if there is more Sikh people there, they have corrected Lovely by giving them tickets
 kya puure congress main sirf lavali hi sikh he? kya us chunaav kshetra main lavali ke sivaa koi or sikh netaa nahin he ? vikalp ke rup main congress duusare netaaon ko bhi bananaa chahie tha
 The Congress is being completely decimated in Odisha
 yahaan bhi netaa apni manamaani chalaate hai
 New people do not get a chance
 ek samay odisha main congress taqatvar maani jaati thi
 Till 2000, most of the Congress ruled in Odisha, but after 2000, the condition of the Congress in Odisha started getting thin
 vahaan ke netaa sirf apana phayda dekhte chale gaye
 Didn't think about what people think
 log jin netaaon ko baar baar riject kar rahe hai congress ko agle chunaav main phir unheen netaaon ko tikat detii he
 In Odisha, Congress has more familism
 baap ke naam par betaa yaa betiyon ko tikat milti he
 That is why the Congress's core voter in Odisha has shifted to BJP
 congress kaa vot pratishat lagaataar kam hota ja rahaa he
 In 2014, the Congress was second in most places, but this time it has come in third place
 congress ke saath sabase badi samasya yah he ki nae logon ko chunaav main mauka nahin detii he
 Leaders whom people repeatedly reject are given tickets
 odisha main congress ko naveen patnayak se siikhnaa chahie
 Naveen Patnaik is the chief minister for 19 consecutive years and has won this time
 paanch baar lagaataar mukhyamantri bananaa koi choti baat nahin he
 Opposition has completely failed in Odisha in front of Naveen's planning
 2014 main modi lahar main bhi naveen ne odisha main bijepi ko roka
 This time also managed to stop the BJP
 naveen ne is baar 33 pratishat mahilayon ko tikat diya he
 Naveen has given tickets to the winning candidates in the Lok Sabha, there is no criminal case against anyone
 kai puraane netaaon ke tikat bhi badal diya
 Congress did not learn anything from the 2014 debacle
 in paanch saalon main congress ne nae netaaon ko nahin bana paaya yaa phir nae chehre ko mauka nahin diya
 Rahul Gandhi should also introspect
 logon se judane kii jarurat he logon se milane kii jarurat he
 Voters are everything in this country
 wo kabhi kisi ko hero banaate he to kabhi kisi ko jiro
 That is why the leader should not always consider himself a hero
 uske har pradarshan ko matadaata dekh rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has a chance that the leaders who are not performing should make those leaders non-playing captain who sit outside and give their advice
 nae logon mauka de
 Give opportunity to the youth who are working sincerely or else the Congress will end the Congress

 On September 6, the upper castes across the country shut down India, expressing resentment against the central government against amendments to the SC / ST Act
 desh ke savarnon kaa jatigat maamle main mandal andolan ke baad yah is tarah kaa doosraa sabase bada pradarshan tha, jisamen ve sarkaar ke khilaaf sadak par utre
 There was a time when the upper castes were agitated against the implementation of the recommendations of the former Prime Minister VP Singhdwara Mandal Commission
 aaj uski punrariti hoti dikh rahi he jabpradhanmantri narendra modiki sarkaar ne supreme court ke faisle ko palatate hue essi / asti act main sanshodhan kar ise mul swaroop main behaal kar diya
 With this decision of the Modi government, the original vote bank (savarna) of BJP came out on the streets
 veepi singh: wo raja jo fakir ho gaya'raja nahin fakir he, desh kii takadir he', yah naaraa jab pradhanmantri kaarylay main baithe manda naresh or purv pradhanmantri vishwanath pratap singh ke kaanon main gunja hoga to unhen ek baar jarur laga hoga ki desh ke aarthik or saamaajik taur par pichhadon ke liye avasar ke jo dwaar unhone khole hai, vah unhen bhavishya main phir se satta ke shikhar par baitha degaa
 VP Singh was an advocate of affirmative action in the matter of social justice
 kam logon ko pataa hoga ki bhudaan andolan main hissaa lete hue unhone apni zyaadaatar jameen daan main de di thi
 For which his family had broken up with him
 mandal kamishan kii siforishein lagu karne ko lekar bhaajapa va anya vipakshi dalon kaa abhijatya varg veepi singh se is kadar naaraaz hua ki unhen satta se bedakhal karne ko lekar sab ek ho gaye
 Even Chandrashekhar of his own community became a challenge for him against VP Singh
 us samay veepi singh kii sanyukt morcha sarkaar bijepi kii baisakhi par chal rahi thi
 There was discussion of Mandal commission in the country
 lekin us vakt mandal andolan ko kharmandal karne ke liye bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kamandal uthaa liya
 Lalu Yadav intercepted Advani's chariot and arrested him
 bijepi ne sanyukt morcha kii sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya or sansad main vishwaas mat ke dauraan unki sarkaar gir gai
 What happened after that is history
 saamaajik nyaay ke liye itnaa patibaddh hone ke baavjood unhen ek khalanaayak kii tarah yaad karne waalon kii taadaad bahut zyada he
 Those opposing him believe that he had implemented the recommendations of the Mandal Commission to pursue his political interests
 ram mandir andolan ke baad kii jaateey pahchaan kii raajnneeti yah hindutv kii god main baithi hui mili
 Today, the enthusiasm shown in the backward classes about the BJP was not exactly the intention of VP Singh
 narendra modi: ham to fakir aadmi hai, jhola lekar chal padenge!veepi singh ke nidhan ke lagbhag 10 saal baad ek or 'fakir' desh kii kaman sambhaal rahaa he
 Remember the speech delivered in Moradabad by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2016, in which he said that 'we are a fakir man, we will carry a bag'
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki modi ko pradhanmantri banane main desh ne jati se upar uthakar unhen itani zyada siten deen
 But it is also not untrue that the fire of ethnic strife was still burning under the ashes, which had been pacified by the kamandal during the Mandal movement
 baharhaal essi / asti act ko lekar supreme court kaa faisla, uske baad daliton kaa deshvyapee andolan or phir dabaav main sarkaar dwaara sarvocch nyaayalay kaa aadesh palatate hue act main sanshodhan kar use mul rup main lagu karnaa
 All these developments have again ignited the fire that was buried somewhere
 savarna, bhartiya janata party kaa mul vot bank hai, jinaki andekhi bijepi nahin kar sakati
 So the backward and scheduled castes / tribes who trusted Prime Minister Modi cannot be ignored
 yah sawaal haal hi main dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah sang bhaajapa shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii baithak main jor shor se uthaa tha
 All the Chief Ministers also made the Prime Minister aware of the displeasure of the upper castes regarding this decision
 is baithak main yah bhi zikr hua ki kis tarah se fasebuk, whats ap or anya soshal media plateform par ek sangathit abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he, jisamen savarnon dwaara aagaamee chunaavon main nota kaa vikalp apnaane kii apil kii ja rahi he
 After discussing the situation in the country and the state, the agitation of the upper castes has put the Modi government and BJP in a dilemma
 dharm ke naam par jatiyon main bante hindu samaaj ko ikattha karne kii ranneeti ek baar phir jati ke naam par tuutati dikh rahi he
 If you look at the history, the Modi government may also have to bear the brunt of this decision in the coming times
 kyonki saamaajik nyaay ko lekar itnaa bada faisla lene ke baavjood purv pradhanmantri veepi singh saarvajanik jivan main haashie par chale gaye the
 Actually, there is a bitter truth in the politics of this country that whoever works above the interests of his caste group will be marginalized in public life
 kyonki hamaare desh kaa loktantr ek aise chunavi tantra main tabdeel ho gaya he, jiskaa khyaal sabhi raajnneetik dal rakhte hai yaa rakhane ko majaboor hai

 On October 21, Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was campaigning for the Congress in the last year's assembly elections and the Lok Sabha elections held this year, has started raising questions about the distance from the Jhabua by-election

 At that time, a large crowd used to listen to him in the meetings of Scindia
 sindhiya ne jhabua main abhi tak ek bhi sabha nahin kii he
 At the same time, BJP has described it as a conspiracy between the Kamal nath-digvijay duo
 purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne to kaha he ki khud congress ab sindhiya ko nahin puch rahi he
 There are so many factions in the Congress that each group is trying to degrade each other
 ab sindhiya ko chunaav prachaar main bulaayaa yaa nahin bulaayaa ye to congress jane lekin puri congress party aisi hi he
 State vice-president Rameshwar Sharma has said that the jugalbandi of Kamal nath-digvijay has made this condition of Scindia

 In Mizoram, the Mizo National Front has returned to power after ten years and has sent a grief-stricken party from the Northeast to the Congress, steeped in victory in three states
 joramathanga ek dfa phir se rajya ke mukhyamantri banane ja rahe hai
 But very few people know the interesting story of the birth of this party which is associated with the blossoming of a flower, but that flower was not a 'lotus flower'! The flower was of bamboo
 aapane shaayad bans ke phool nahin dekhe honge, kyonki yah phool khilata hi bahut barason main ek baar he
 This happens about forty-eight years later when the flowers bloom in the bamboo forest
 bans ke phulon ke khilne ke dauraan chuuhe ise khate hai or isse chuhon kii prajnan shakti kaaphi bad jaati he or hindustani lokoktiyon or muhaavaron main bans ke jangal main phool khilne ko apshakun mana jaataa he
 The reason is that in a farming country India, if rats become excessive, they will destroy the crops and the possibility of famine will increase
 san 1959 kii baat he
 That year too, flowers bloomed in the bamboo forests of the Northeast
 chuhon kii sankhya betahasha bad gai thi or unhone puure ilaake ke gharon-godaamon ke anaaj chat kar die
 By the time the Delhi government woke up, the corrupt officials-traders had black-marketed the grains and the people became disillusioned
 assam sarkaar ke ek purv acountint ne iske khilaaf logon ko golband karnaa or apane str par raahat kaary karnaa shuru kar diya
 He created the National Mizo Femin Front (later renamed Mizo National Front) and the movement soon became anti-india

 It is said that the army forcibly moved the people along the highway to monitor the people from the villages

 Thousands of people have been killed, disappeared and rendered homeless in Mizoram, a bloody conflict that lasted for nearly two decades

 The Indian government was forced to use the Air Force against its own people for the first time when the separatists announced the capture of Mizoram's main city of Lungleh and liberated the region from the Indian Union
 isse algaavvaadiyon ko jangal main sharan leni padi or jaan-maal kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua
 In 1986, a peace agreement was signed during the tenure of Rajiv Gandhi, in which bureaucrats like G
 Parthasarathy played an important role and that terrorist kept the weapon

 july, 1990 main laldenga kii mrityu fefde ke cancer se ho gai or uske baad unke kabhi leftinent or sachiv rahe joramthanga party ke adhyaksh bane
 This is the same Zoramthanga who, during the Mizo National Front's separatist form and during Mizoram's 1966 declaration of 'independence', was a believer in Laldenga and gritty in India's eyes
 lekin vakt ne aisi palati maari ki laldenga or joramthanga ko shanti kii ahmiyat samaj main aa gai or mizoram aaj purvottar ke rajyon main sabase tarakkee karata hua rajya he or vikaas ke kai maanakon par ek model state he
 The last time flowers in the bamboo forests were in Mizoram in 2008 and the provision of budget for bamboo cultivation became a social media humor when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced the 'national Bamboo Mission' in the budget of 2018-19
 Of! But who knew six decades ago that a political party would be formed because of the bamboo flower? *** sarkari padon par nikali he kai naukari, zyada jaankaree ke liye jarur padhein 14 june ke JOB ALERT

 dhoni kaa maananaa he ki agar yah pad kuch samay ke liye khaali bhi rah jaae to koi baat nahin

 With the departure of Duncan Fletcher after the World Cup, there are constant speculations about the coach position

 He said, 'if you guys are indirectly indicating that we need a coach, we have a lot of sporting staff who can take care of the players

 - Input IANS loksabhaa chunaav 2019 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye jitna mahatvapurn he, usase kahin zyada isaki ahmiyat samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or bahujan samaaj party kii pramukh mayawati ke liye maani ja rahi he
 This is the reason why in order to preserve its political existence, the SP-BSP has decided to forget the 23-year-old rivalry and forge an alliance
 iske baavjood agar sapa-basapa milakar bhi narendra modi ke vijay rath ko uttar pradesh main nahin roak pate hai to phir donon dalon khaskar basapa ke liye apane raajnneetik vajood ko barkaraar rakh paanaa mushkil sabit ho saktaa he
 Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have put a big challenge in front of Narendra Modi by forming an alliance, but in the way the Congress has decided to field all the seats as a third force by joining small regional parties of the state
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan dalit, yadav or muslim votbank ke dam par jahaan soobe kii siyaasi jang fatah karne kii ummid laga rahi hai
 At the same time, BJP is talking of repeating the results like 2014 with the help of upper caste, non-yadav OBC and non-jatav Dalit voters
 haalanki, congress ko teen rajyon main mili jeet se uske hausale buland he
 In such a situation, the possibility of triangular competition is visible
 soobe kaa siyaasi sangram main koi bhi kisi se kam nahin najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the SP-BSP are unable to beat Modi in the state, then a political crisis is bound to arise in front of him
 sapa-basapa ke liye astitv bachaane kii chunautiupi ke 2012 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad se mayawati kaa lagaataar janaadhar gata he
 His party has lost two consecutive assembly elections and his account in the Lok Sabha is not even open
 maujuuda samay main upi main basapa ke paas 19 vidhayak hai, lekin loksabhaa sadsy ek bhi nahin he
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav lost power in 2017 after eating out in SP 2014
 sapa ke paas mahaj 47 vidhayak he, ye party ke itihaas main sabase kam he
 In such a situation, if the SP-BSP do not have any big charisma in 2019, then it will be very difficult for both the parties to preserve their existence
 dalit-obisi votbank kii daavedaari kamjor hogisube kaa dalit matadaata basapa kaa mulvot bank mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that the BSP has got around 19 percent votes in 2014 and 21 percent in 2017
 vahiin, sapa kaa paramparaagat vot bank yadav or muslim ke saath-saath obisi maane jate hai
 In view of this, the SP-BSP has formed an alliance, but despite this, if they are not able to beat the BJP, then the vote bank of both the parties may be inclined towards other parties
 modi virdohi muhim kamjor hogiuttar pradesh main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek badi raajnneetik takat ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Both parties are also very strong in terms of political and ethnic equations
 aise main ye bhi raajnneetik prayog modi ke khilaaf safal nahin hota he to iske baad kam se kam upi main modi virdohi muhim ko tagada jhatka lagegaa
 In the state, the national parties will dominate
 If the SP-BSP are not able to beat the BJP in the electoral arena, then in such a situation, the vote banks of both parties can collapse
 aisi sthiti main in donon dalon ke paramparaagat vot rashtriya dalon kii taraf jane kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 If this happens, both the Congress and bjp-parties will gain strength from it

 The Game of lifestardew valleybloons TD 5grand Theft Auto: San Andreas What is samadhi? Is there really any truth to samadhi? Can a person really come back alive after going into samadhi for days, months or years? These questions about samadhi have been there for centuries, but a Baba's 15-day earth mausoleum in Bihar has revived him
 madhepura ke pramod baba itane hi dinon tak bagaiyr khaae-pie jameen ke neeche rahe or phir baahar nikal aae, lekin ye kya tha? baba kaa koi chamatkaar yaa phir logon ko bharamaane kaa koi khel?darasal, 30 saal ke pramod bababiharke hi purniya jile ke rahane vaale hai, lekin logon kii maane, to unhone madhepura ke bhagatama jiromile naam ke is gaanv ko hi apni karmbhumi bana rakhi he
 This time, he has surprised everyone by taking a tomb for fifteen days in this same work place
 jab baba ne jaahir kii bhu-samadhi kii ichhagaanv waalon kii maane to baba ne pichley maheene logon ke kalyaan ke lievishnumahayajna karne kaa elaan kiya or yajna se pehle is bhu-samadhi kii ichha jaahir kii
 If Baba was new, perhaps his people would have doubted his powers, but for years in this village, Baba's devotees did not find anything strange in it
 pichley 12 saalon se nahin khaaya annapichley 12 saalon se bhi zyada vakt se kathith taur par bagaiyr ann khaae or bagaiyr bole-chaale rahanevaale in mauni baba ke bhu-samadhi kii taiyaariyaan shuru ho gayi
 For about a week, a tunnel 10 meters long and 14 feet deep was dug in the middle ground for Babaki Samadhi
 jab surang main gum ho gaye babaphir 28 farvari ko dopaher ke dhai baje baba surang main gum ho gaye
 Even all was well, but at the behest of Baba, the mouth of the tunnel was covered with bamboo arches and mud, and inside the tunnel, Baba began to worship at the Samadhi
 pandrah dinon tak baba jameen ke nichebaba ne surang ke andar deraa daalaa or baahar bhakton kaa rela shuru ho gaya
 Thousands of people thronged the tomb to get a glimpse of Baba and his tunnel
 jayakaaron se puraa ilaaka gunjane laga or meley kii surat main baba kii bhu-samadhi kaa jashn manaaya jane laga
 Meanwhile, there were as many talks about Baba's stay under the ground for fifteen days
 15 din baad baahar nikle babakisi ke liye ye chamatkaar tha, kisi ke liebaba ji kaa khel
 Amidst all these things, the biggest question was whether after 15 days Baba would truly come out of his land samadhi safely or else this samadhi would prove to be his last samadhi
 tamaam kudarti niyam-kanoonon ke ulat 15 din baad baahar nikal kar baba ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 Pramod Baba, popularly known as Mouni Baba, Pramod Baba, popularly known as Baba Mauni Baba, went to the fair outside when he went under the ground for samadhi
 havan pujan se lekar jayakaaron kaa daur shuru ho gaya, lekin naa to kisi ne baba ko jameen ke neeche jate hue dekha or naa hi kisi ne baahar aate hue
 All media cameras were also kept away from this tomb in public place
 to kya logon kii nigahon se dur lee gai is samadhi main hi samadhi kaa sach chipa tha?madhepura kaa jila prashasan bhi natmastakkhud pramod baba ne jahaan maun vrath dhaaran kar rakhaa he, vahiin unke bhakton or shraddhaluon main se koi bhi is sawaal kaa sidhaa or saaf-saaf jawaab dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 By the way, before this tomb of Baba's Samadhi and devotees, the district administration of Madhepura itself is also bowed down
 tabhi to ilaake ke sarkari adhikari yahaan pahunch kar baba ko samadhi lene se rokane kii koshish karne ke baad bhi apane iraade main kaamyaab nahin ho sake or unhen bairang lautnaa padaa
 Nobody saw Baba, who was in the name of Samadhi, for 15 days, and on the last day he suddenly became noticeable in front of everyone
 ab ise aap chamatkaar kahen, andhvishwaas yaa phir baba ji kaa khel

 dubai main ek sho hota he
 The host of the show was a famous RJ from Ahmedabad, a radio jockey
 us sho kii jo vinar banati he usase aaraje ko pyaar ho jaataa he
 She was also from Ahmedabad
 phir aanan-fanan main donon shaadi bhi kar lete hai
 After this, the same girl dies every day by falling down from the tenth floor of a building in Ahmedabad
 pyaar se lekar shaadi or shaadi se lekar maut ye sab kuch sirf do maheene main hota he
 But before he dies, a message is sent to his friend from the girl's mobile
 massej main likhaa tha- suicide at sachin tower
 Kunal Desai, a successful radio jockey from Ahmedabad
 ahmedabad kii hi ek aam ladki bhoomi panchal
 Faqat, what happened when the two met in Dubai during a show two months ago, the two were left together forever
 unhen pehali najar main pyaar ho gaya or phir donon ne shaadi bhi kar lee
 But just before this beautiful couple could live their married life properly, a twist came in this love story
 dasvin manzil se girakar kiya sucidehmadabad ke posh ilaake main maujuud hai-rij building sachin tower kii dasvin manzil se bhoomi neeche ginati he or dam tod detii he
 And thus Fakat gets the end of a short love story of two months but with few questions
 kya bhoomi ne dasvin manzil se khud chalaang lagaai?kya bhoomi nekhudakushiki?yaa bhoomi ko kisi ne upar se dhakka diya?magar in savalon ko abhi or hawa miltaa tabhi achaanak ek nayaa khulaasa hota he
 a friend of Bhoomi comes in and says that just ten minutes before he dies, Bhoomi has sent him an SMS
 esemes main usne likhaa tha- suicide ait sachin tower
 What is the secret behind the message, but was it true? Or was there some other secret behind this SMS as well? Is it not so that someone tried to cover the truth of death by sending this SMS to his friend from the mobile phone of the land? Go and commit suicide darasal sachin tower se naa to kunal kaa koi lenaa-dena tha or naa hi bhoomi kaa
 Neither both lived here nor did any of their knowledge stay here
 haa, itnaa jarur he ki jis sachin tower kii dasvin manzil se neeche gir kar bhoomi kii maut hui thik usee sachin tower ke peeche bhoomi ke pati yani aaraje kunal kaa studio jarur tha
 In such a situation, even if the land committed suicide, why did he choose the Sachin tower for death? The husband's office is only nearby, so it seems strange that someone jumped from a nearby building
 is kahani main bhoomi yaa kunal kaa is building se bas itnaa hi rishta tha
 But what did Kunal and Bhoomi's relationship outside the building take such a turn that the whole story ended in two months? taliban ab pakistan ke khilaaf hi takat dikhaa rahaa he

 Apart from this, terrorists are hiding in slums in the hill areas of Manghopir and Orangi
 report main ye bhi bataaya gaya he ki pratibandhit sanghathan taharik e taliban ke naayab amir or hasan mahmud bhi karachi main hi chhipe hue hai
 After this report, there is an atmosphere of panic in Karachi
 kuch samay pehle soharaab goth main hi taliban ke aatankwaadiyon ke hone kii khabar mili thi or jab police ne ek chote se hotel main chapa maaraa to aatankwaadiyon ne police par hamalaa bol diya tha
 All the policemen on the team would have been killed if another police team had not reached from behind
 tab tak talibani do pulicekarmiyon kii hatya kar chuke the or 11 ko ghayal kar chuke the
 The rest of the policemen came out of Sohrab Goth as a way of life
 iske baad siaidi ke esaspi fayyaj khan ne chapa maaraa or taliban ke aath aatankwaadiyon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan
 ise pakistan kii aarthik rajdhani kaha jaataa he
 This is Port City

 On May 26, when Narendra Modi was swearing in as Prime Minister, 46-year-old Uday Singh Deshmukh (bhyuji Maharaj) was also brought among his 4,000 VIP guests
 aam taur par baba log kisi math-mandir yaa shrriddhalu ke ghar tikte hai, lekin bhayyuji dakshin dilli ke ambesder hotel main tehre or kuch chuninda logon se mulaakaat ke baad agle din indore laut gaye
 This time Delhi did not pay much attention to this person, but when he last came to break the fast of Anna Hazare at Ramlila Maidan in 2011, everyone's eyes were on him
 yahi nahin, us samay jedy (you) adhyaksh sharad yadav ne loksabhaa main jab anna andolan par apni bhadaas nikaali to bhayyuji ko bhi khub lapeta tha
 At that time people saw for the first time a man who looked like a white-spotted, high-spirited hero as a monk
 yah bhartiya aadhyatmik jagat kaa bilkul nayaa kalevar tha
 Maratha, accomplished in fencing and horse riding, tried to persuade Anna at the call of a minister of the then UPA government
 or ab ve jis tarah se gujarat main 'sant nagari’ bana rahe hai, usase lagata he ki nai sarkaar main is nae daur ke 'maharaj’ kii puch parakh badaae ja rahi he
 The Sant Nagri project was announced by Narendra Modi on 28 January 2011
 is pariyojna main bharat ke sabhi dharmon ke 2,700 se zyada sant-mahatmaon kii murtiyon or itihaas sanjoya jayega, taaki nai peedi bharat kii aadhyatmik viraasat se rou-ba-rou ho sake
 In his meeting in Indore adorned with the image of Bal Shivaji standing by holding the finger of mother Jijabai and the beautiful deities of Lord Ganesha, the science graduate said about the 'sant Nagari', "here the idols and views of the gurus of all religions of India are quoted Will be done
 ” darasal unhone gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ko sant nagari kaa prastaav bheja tha, jise unhone hathonhaath sweekaar kar liya
 In the changed political environment of the country, such projects can redefine political relations along with religion
 yah baat bhi dhyaan dene kii he ki 2011 main modi jab ahmedabad main sadbhaavna upwas par baithe the—yah upwas us samay vivaad main aa gaya tha jab modi ne muslim topi pahanane se manaa kar diya tha—us vakt duusare santon ke saath bhayyuji bhi vahaan maujuud the
 And he was among those who favored Modi citing the development of Gujarat
 baharhaal, apane ashram main lage chitra main bharat mata ke haath main hal thamane vaala sant bade chaav se bataata he ki kaise usne maharashtra main pardi samaaj kii mahilaon ko veshyavriti se nikaalane ke liye kaam kiya he or kaise unka 'shri sadguru dutt dharmik evam parmaarthik trust’ ab tak 7,709 kanyaon kaa vivaah kara chukaa he
 He is a spiritual master who has modeled for Siyaram Suiting, who does not avoid expensive cars, but is willing to count the amount of money in the trust account
 jab aap unase dharmik kaaryon ke bare main poochhate hai to ve saamaajik kaaryon kaa byora dete hai
 As they will tell with great passion that they have rebuilt hundreds of ponds in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
 deshbhar main unhone 19
 Has planted 39 lakh saplings and to arouse people's trust in democracy, their trust has so far distributed 1
5 lakh copies of the constitution
 darasal, unka maananaa he ki aadhyatm se jude logon kii jimmedaari samaaj ke prati baaki logon se kahin zyada he or dharm se jude log agar apane prabhaav kaa sahi istemaal karen to samaaj ke liye zyada kaam kar sakate hai
 They are embodying the image of a new type of karmayogi
 ve vivaahit hai
 They have a daughter
 or ve aam grihasth kii tarah isi 2 may ko apane pitaaji ke nidhan se pehle tak mata-pita ke saath ghar main rah rahe the
 According to them, they travel several hundred kilometers every day, so that they keep an eye on the social work they are doing
 ve fasebuk, twitor par sakriy hai or apana blog bhi chalaate hai
 The topics of his blog can range from religion, social work to schizophrenia (a type of mental illness)
 sadhu-mahatmaon kii puraatan style kii bajaae ve aakarshak pahanaave or nai jabaan ko tarjeeh dete hai
 Instead of giving blessings to Mahatmas, they want to create a definition of a volunteer type of monk who wants to work on his own instead of blessing a person capable of doing work
 shaayad isiilie pratibha patil, narendra modi, nitin gadakari, smriti irani, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh, uddhav thakare, prithviraj chouhan jaise bahut se netaaon ke saath unki tasviren aapako dekhne ko mil jaaengi
 Earlier it seemed that the Congress leaders are closer to them, but if we examine the BJP leaders who are related to them, then the same thing can be seen
 uddhav thakare ko bahut acha netaa maanane vaale bhayyuji narendra modi kii is baat ke kaayal hai ki modi achche prastaavon ko badi teji se pahchaan lete hai or un par kaam karte hai
 Despite these political connections, they believe that governments cannot do much
 samaaj uddhaar kaa kaam samaaj ko hi karnaa hoga
 And then putting your big eyes in your eyes deeply, question both the society and the government, "why should a black deer hunter get a Padma Shri?" Those who are Rs 500
 film dekhne par kharch kar sakate hai, unhen mahangaai kaa ronaa rone kaa kya haq he? samaaj agar galat logon ko apana adarsh banayega to khud bhi galat disha main jayega
 "so can you come into politics too? The simple answer to this question is, "never
" ” to kya baba ramdev kii tarah kii prakarantar raajnneeti karenge? is par bhi miltaa-julata jawaab, ''kisi se tulana karnaa uchit nahin he
 "but they definitely say that work has to be done in this society, so everyone's cooperation will have to be taken
 netaa or raajnneeti se parhez karne kaa koi tuk nahin he
 Now you have to decide whether with this cooperation you will build your big monastery or spend it on the public
 yani bhayyuji main ve saare lakshan dikhaari de rahe hai jo ab tak tejatarraar saamaajik kaaryakartaaon main dekhe gaye hai
 As such, their method of getting the ponds excavated is very simple
 ashram main salbhar bhandare kaa sanchaalan karne vaale bhayyuji kaa suzav he, ''yaa to main bhakton se sone-chaandi ke singhaasana banavaa luun yaa phir unase samaaj ke kaam kara luun
 Somebody has a JCB machine, someone is a big contractor, someone is doing stone work
 main unase kahata hum ki amuk kaam ke liye apane sansaadhan laga do or ve laga dete hai
 Together they do not forget to say that devotees do not work for the sake of charity, but they all have their own interests
 ve to yah kaam isliye karte hai ki ishwar unke swaarth puraa karegaa
 But by doing this, Bhagyuji is saved from any kind of economic scams or being called Dhanna Seth Maharaj, because the work is going on but the money is not being transacted by his trust
 lambey samay tak maharashtra or madhya pradesh main kaam karne ke baad ab ve apane kaam kaa dayera desh ke baaki hisson main le jane ko utsuk hai
 a large number of his devotees are from the people of Maharashtra, but the scope of his projects has reached Gujarat
 brahmamuhoort se sadhana main rat hone ke baavjood ve din main bade-bade saamaajik or rajnatik maamalon main madhyasth ke taur par uplabdh hai
 After becoming a landlord from a landlord's boy to a seeker, then a seeker to a model, and then from a model to a householder saint, how will the horizon of Bhagyuji Maharaj now expand, it is not easy to say
 lekin agar bharat ke dharmik jagat kaa 30-40 saal kaa itihaas dekhen to yahaan rajnatik satta ke samaantar ubharne, chamakane or phir sthir ho jane vaale sadhu-mahatmaon kii lambii jamaat he
 The kind of aggression, spirituality, and political relationships that have been found in all of these are also largely visible in Bhayuji
 apane mata-pita ko hi apana sabase bada ishwar maanane vaale bhayyuji philhal samajaseva par dhyaan laga rahe hai
 But know so much that from the land of Malwa, a new comet, which is making a bridge between spirituality and politics, is rising

 yahaan sarkaar banane kii kavayad tej to he lekin aarope-pratyarope kaa jo silsilaa chal niklaa he usase na keval uljhan paidaa ho rahi he balki ek tarah kii niraashaa bhi
 In fact, the credit for bringing the politics to a boil here goes to Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, who in his old style has accused the BJP
 unhone pehle to kaha ki party unke vidhayakon ko laalach de rahi he, phir kaha ki vah congress ke vidhayakon ko tod rahi he or jab isse bhi baat nahin bani to sidhaa uparajyapal nazeeb jang par hi aarope laga diya ki guruuvar ko vah bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa aamantran dene ja rahe hai
 Kejriwal, as usual, was seen making all kinds of statements through radio, television and posters
 ek antaryami kii tarah ve ‘sab kuch’ bataane lage
 For Kejriwal, who was badly defeated in the Lok Sabha elections, Delhi is now an important destination and a majority in the Assembly is a question of survival for him
 unhone pichhali baar mukhyamantri pad se istipha dekar jo galati kii, uskaa praayshchit vah phir se yahaan sarkaar banaakar karnaa chaahate hai, jo sambhav nahin dikhataa
 It is obvious that he does not want the BJP to form a government here and hence, like a skilled politician, is already accusing the party of breaking the mlas of the other party
 lekin unke aaropon main abhi tak to koi thos sachai nahin dikh rahi he
 Not only this, the allegation against the Lt
 Governor that he will call BJP to form the government is absurd
 dilli vidhansabha main bijepi sabase zyada sadasyon vaali party he or agar uparajyapal use sarkaar banane ke liye bulaate hai to yah kanuunan koi galat nahin hoga
 The Lieutenant Governor gave Kejriwal a chance and he formed the government
 lekin phir vah khud hi ronaa rote hue istipha dekar chale gaye, jaise ki vahaan unke saath bahut ninsaphi ho rahi ho
 Now he does not want the BJP to get an invitation to form the government
 unki nazaron main yah galat hoga
 His poignant thinking shows that he considers his right to the government in Delhi
 or shaayad isliye vah congress se milakar apni sarkaar bananaa chaahate hai
 But it is not so easy and they have no idea what the consequences will be
 teji se lokapriyata kho rahi unki party aisi sarkaar banane ke baad to janata kii nazaron se itani gir jaaegi ki unhen apni vidhansabha seat bachaane ke liye bhi sangharsh karnaa pad jayega
 As far as the BJP is concerned, the party will have to avoid the greed to form the government and talk about holding the elections again, keeping away from such demands of some mlas
 dilli bijepi ko kisi tarah ke dalbadal yaa vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht se bachanaa chahie
 Doing so would be fatal for the entire party and the respect which the party has gained will be mattered
 ummid yahi kerani chahie ki anuchit dhang se sarkaar banane kii bajaay bijepi chunaav kii taiyaari karegi
 It is the good of democracy itself
 calculator se jaaniye apni sahi fitness umrafitness kii sahi umr norwegian uniwarsity of science and technology kii website se aap sahi fitness umr kii gananaa kar sakate hai
 VO2 Max shows how well the body is functioning and how it should work according to age
 aapako apni qamar ke ghere ko semi main or apane resting heart rate (30 second tak pulse rate dekhen or uskaa doguna kar den) ko naapnaa hoga
 Then you have to give information about age, gender, exercise, the calculator will tell your correct fitness age

 Do not do too much, do not do vigorous exercise for more than 45 minutes
 isse jokhim kam se kam or phayda zyada se zyada hoga
 Last month, news came that five terrorists had entered Uran adjoining Mumbai
 iske baad combing oparation chalaa, saghan jaanch hui, aatankiyon kii khabar galat nikali, lekin jaanch ne kai or baton se pardaa uthaa diya
 It was discovered that thousands of seized containers in the country's largest container port Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in the last five years for different reasons are a big threat to the security, because even after years and months, their auctions Has not happened, and many of these containers also contain explosives
 jeenpiti main pichley paanch saal main lagbhag 7,000 container jabt kiye gaye, jo kai saal se yahaan alag-alag 32 fret steshnon, yani siemoes main rakhe gaye hai
 Of these containers, 282 contain hazardous and flammable substances such as ammunition, with 50 containers containing crackers from China
 in contenron kii kul keemat lagbhag 2,500 karod rupee he
 JNPT Deputy Chairman Neeraj Bansal himself admits, "holding period above 1,000 days, there is a lockup of such value, there is a need to be more active in the coming time
 
 
 " The security of these freight stations can be gauged from the fact that a few days ago, smugglers stole three containers filled with sandal wood from the customs warehouses, which the Customs themselves complained about
 Was lodged in jeenpiti ke do terminlon se har saal 45 lakh contenron kii awajahi hoti he, so, aise main ye jabt container khud jeenpiti ke liye bada sirdard hai
 The comments bansal ke mutabik, alag-alag agenciyon se enosi (anaapatti praaanpatr) nahin milane se lekar contenron ke saalon-saal vahaan pade rahane kii kai vajahen hai
 He said, "we confiscated
 
 
 saamaan jaanchane ke baad custom dekhtaa he duty bhari he yaa nahin

 Under the Customs Act, if a person who imports goods in the country does not take it within 60 days, it can be disposed off, but the situation is becoming explosive due to lack of coordination between different agencies

 in fret steshnon kii suraksha kitni lachar he, iskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kuch din pehle custom ke godaamon se taskaron ne chandan kii lakdi se bhare teen container chura liye the, jisaki shikaayat khud custom adhikariyon ne nhava-sheva police stesan main darj karai thi
 The jnpt's two terminals have a movement of 4
5 million containers every year, so the seized containers are a big headache for the JNPT itself
 tippaniyan According to Bansal, there are a number of reasons for containers to remain there for years, ranging from non-receipt of NOC (no Objection Certificate) from different agencies
 unhone kaha, "hamane zabt kiya
 
 
 After checking the luggage, the custom sees whether the duty is full or not
 
 
 uske baad nilaamee hoti he
 
 
 Frequent auction is taking place

 When the Revenue Secretary came, a big meeting took place here

 " There is also a concern on the port scanners, which are insufficient to check the containers coming here

 The Kashmir Valley is once again boiling
 or vahaan jab-jab is tarah ke halaat banate hai to soshal media par ek tabaka pandit jawaharlal nehru ko dosha dene kaa koi mauka nahin chodta
 But in history they have also been the grooves which tell how accurate and far-reaching Nehru was thinking about Kashmir and if the then Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had obeyed Nehru, neither Kashmir would have been a tribal attack and Neither would we face these situations today
 kashmiripar kabyli hamale ke ek maheene pehle 27 sitambar 1947 ko pandit nehru ne sardaar patel ko patr likhakar aagaah kiya lekin patel ise amal main nahin laa paae
 These letters have been published in 'sardar Patel Chosen Correspondence' part one of Navjivan Prakashan Temple
 pesh hai iske khaas ansh-1
 The situation in Kashmir is dangerous and is deteriorating
 muslim lig punjab main or uttar-pashchim seemaa praant main kaaphi badi sankhya main kashmir rajya main ghusane kii taiyaari main he
 2
 sheetkaal ke samay kashmir kaa sambandh baaki bharat se cat jayega
 i understand that Pakistan's arrogance is yet to sneak into Kashmir and if Kashmir is cut off from India at least because of the upcoming cold wave, then there is a lot of military action
 3
 i doubt that the Maharaja and the armies of his kingdom would be able to face this situation on their own without public assistance

 Sheikh Abdullah and the leaders of the National Conference should be freed from prison, try to befriend them, seek their cooperation, and then declare to meet in the Indian Union
 ek baar kashmir rajya bharat se jud jaae to phir pakistan ke liye bhartiya sangharsh main aae bina adhikrut rup main yaa anadhikrut rup main kashmir par akraman karnaa bahut kathin ho jayega
 5
 shaikh abdulla pakistan se alag rahane ko bade utsuk hai or salaah-mashvire ke liye ham par bahut aadhaar rakhte hai
 6
 aaj kii uljhi hui sthiti main kya hoga, isaki guarantee koi nahin le saktaa
 But the path i have suggested, i find it more and more sensible and there is a greater possibility of getting any result
 parantu mahatv kii baat yah he ki isamen vilamb nahin hona chahie
 The importance of time cannot be forgotten in this, if delayed, we will be completely cut off from Kashmir with the arrival of winter
 7
 Your advice will naturally have a great impact on the chef
 mujhe aashaa he ki aap is maamle main koi aisa kadam uthaaenge, jisseghatnaonki gati bade or ve sahi disha main mode len
 If treated properly, the National Conference can prove to be of great benefit to us
 is laabh ko khona bada dukhad hoga
 Sheikh Abdullah has repeatedly assured that he wants to cooperate
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki ve meri salaah ke anusaar kaam karenge
 8
 main ek baar or kahuunga ki is maamle main samay kaa bahut bada mahatv he or sab baaten is dhang se kii jaani chahie ki shaikh abdulla ke sahyog se kashmir jaldi se jaldi bhartiya sangh main jud jaae
 But Sardar could not follow Nehru's advice in due course of time and in the last week of October 1947, Kashmir became tribal

 suryadevara kaa vidhansabh main deputesan khatm ho gaya he or unke mul vibhaag prasar bharti ne unase turant jwoin karne ke liye notice diya he

 prasar bharti ne unase is baat par bhi spashtikaran maanga he ki unhone sarkari seva main rahete hue sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti ke samarthan main akhbaar main artical kaise likh diya

 iske saath hi unke mul vibhaag eiaar ko likhaa tha ki suryadevara kii sevaayen vidhansabha ko de di jaae
 But the Lt
 Governor had freed Suryadevara from the services of the Delhi Government without bringing the information of the Legislative Assembly, which is an interference in the functioning of the Legislative Assembly
 media se baat karte hue spikar ne kaha, 'takaraav maine nahin khadaa kiya, alji ne khadaa kiya he

 It is not necessary to read verses
 rajpath par 21 june ko yojit samaaroh ke liye samanvay kaa kaam kar rahe aayush mantralay ke mantri shripad nike ne kaha ki musalmaan aayojan ke dauraan shloke padhane kii jagah allaah kaa naam le sakate hai
 The story of a pregnant woman in Devalia village of Botad district of Gujarat is extremely painful
 kareeb aath maheene takbalaatkaar kaa shikarhoti rahi ye mahila ab garbhvatee he
 She wants to bring down the child of rapists in the womb
 lekin gujarat hoicourt ne use is baat kii ijaajat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 In the Devaliya village of Gujarat's Botad district, the woman, who is quietly lying on a cot in a room adorned with bronze and steel utensils, wakes up only to deal with daily chores or narrate her eight-month-old painful story to the police or media
 samuhik balaatkaar kii shikaar 23 saal kii yah yuvati bataati hai, 'unhone kareeb aath maheene tak roj meraa balaatkaar kiya
 Four people were regulars, the rest kept coming and going
 agar main kuch aisa karti jo unhen pasand na aata to vah use peetate
 i was afraid to cry too
 'kabhi ek khush beti, bivi or maa rahi is yuvati ke saat maah ke garbh ko giraane kii yachika ko pichley hafte gujarat ucch nyaayalay ne khaarij kar diya
 Now she is living in her maternal home
 uske maa-pita kii nazren bhi usee par tiki rahati hai
 She says, 'this is the child of my rapists
 main isaki maa hum lekin agar yah baccha mere saath rahegaa to koi bhi mujhe or mere parivaar ko sweekaar nahin karegaa
 The court did not allow abortion
 main sarkaar se prarthana karti hum ki vah is bachche ko apane sarankshan main le le or kisi anathalay main de de
 'the uneasiness within the family is palpable
 peedita apane garbh main pal rahe bachche ko tyaagane ke vichaar se shaayad puri tarah sahamat nahin he
 At the question of keeping the child with her, she falls silent and looks slowly towards her mother
 unki maa jawaab detii hai, 'yah bachche ko kaise rakh sakati he? agar yah aisa karegi to samaaj or gaanv hamen bahishkrut kar degaa
 i have two more children
 meraa 14 saal kaa ladkaa kunvaara rah jayega
 Nobody will respect us
 'wo kahati hai, 'yah maa he lekin baccha balaatkaariyon kaa he, ham use nahin rakh sakate
 'when the mother was saying this, the victim bowed her head in a chair and was sitting in a pillow
 vah us dehshat or sadame ke bare main baat bhi mushkil se hi kar paati hai
 The mention of those days brings tears to his eyes
 khargosh kaa gosht khilaate thipane 18 maheene ke bete ko kheltaa dekhte hue vah kahati hai, 'raat ko vah jangal main khargosh or kaale hiranon kaa shikaar karne jate
 Two people would stop with me and commit wrongdoing (rape)
 phir un do kii jagah duusare do aa jate
 This happened every night for months
 ' peedita ke sasuralwaalon ne use ghar main ghusane se roka to uske pati bhi ghar chhodkar saath hi aa gaye
 She says, "one night when my kidnappers killed a rabbit, two little rabbits came out of its stomach
 main khud ko roak nahin pai or turant unamem se ek ko uthaa liya jisane meri ungliyaan kutarani shuru kar deen
 This reminded me of my children and i started crying
 'police ko di shikaayat main peedita ne saat logon ko namjad kiya he or bataaya he ki vah use lagaataar peetate the
 His hands and tongue tremble while talking
 wo kahati he, 'mujhe rota dekhakar ek ko gussa aa gaya or wo apni bandook se mujhe peetane laga jisamen baaki bhi shaamil ho gaye
 After that incident, they kept me hungry for a few days
 maine khaanaa maanga to unhone mujhe khargosh kaa gosht diya, jo main kha nahin pai
 'rape not live-in relationship' The victim's husband lodged a police report in July last year about his wife's disappearance in Surat
 peedita ke apharan se pehle shahar main unki jindagi aaraam se guzar rahi thi
 The victim's family had to go round the police and the leaders to find them but no help was found
 abhiyukt dafar samudaay se hai jo gujarat kii khanaabadosh jati he
 The victim belongs to the Goddess worship community of Gujarat
 saat namjad abhiyukton main se paanch ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 The role of the Gujarat Police in this case also raised serious questions
 peedita kii maa kahati hai, 'uske gaayab hone ke kuch din baad mujhe uske aparankartaaon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 When i told the police, they said that she is living with them on her own free will and she has given in writing that she has a live-in relationship
 lekin koun kaid rahane or balaatkaar kiye jane ke liye apni marji se kaagaj par dastakhat karata he
 The police did not believe my point
 'lekin is maamle ke jaanch adhikari police upaadhyaksh tejas patel isse anbhigyata jataate hai, 'peedita yaa uske parivaar ke saath is tarah ke vyavhaar ke bare main mujhe nahin pataa
 We have arrested five accused
 ek abhiyukt, gaanv ke sarpanch ne apni giraftaar ke khilaaf adaalat se ste order le liya he or ek faraar he
 The FIR was not written but the victim and her family make serious allegations against the police
 peedita ke paariwarik dost sardaar singh mori kehete hai, 'apartaaon ke kabje se batch nikalne main kaamyaab hone par peedita or unki maa ghanton tak jangal main chupe rahe, uske baad himmat jutakar vah police ke paas gaye
 But there was a possibility that the local policemen refused to write the complaint and then we called the Women's Police Helpline, after which our complaint was written despite not wanting
 'peedita ko medical jaanch ke liye exiaar ke 48 ghante baad le jaaya gaya
 However, after the case went to court and national newspapers made headlines, senior officials of the Gujarat Police started an inspection of the case
 is maamle main police adhikariyon kii bhoomika ko lekar rosh kaa saamana kar rahi gujarat sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko peedita ko 20,000 rupee kii aarthik sahaayta di
 For him, the biggest challenge is to overcome the practice of being 'holy', more difficult than ever to rape and give birth to an unborn child
 soshal media website fasebuk live video main lagaataar nae experiment kar rahaa he
 a recent report has revealed that the company gives crores of rupees to celebrities and media companies to make live videos
 ab fasebukalive videomen ek nayaa feechar jodygi, jiske jariye ek yujar duusare lokation ke yujar ke saath live video broadcast kar saktaa he
 Apart from this, the live video broadcaster can also invite his friends to join it
 haal hi main fasebuk ne MSQRD naam ke ekavideo filterep ko bhi kharida he
 Actually, this app has features like Snapchat through which users can swap their face with the given face
 khabar he bhi he ki ab fasebuk live video main bhikenshishdh ke ficharsyuj karegi
 Apart from this, in the coming days, Facebook live videos can be started directly through the MSQRD app
 aarthik mandi kii tsunami ne puri duniya ko chapet main le rakhaa he
 India has also been affected, but where the whole world has been affected by this recession, the Indian market seems to be coming back on the old path after eating the initial shock
 isaki ek vajah he bharat kii badi aabaadi jisane desh ko mandi kii maar se bahut had tak bachaa liya
 The ever increasing population was undoubtedly a burden for India, but the same population is making life in Indian industries
 duniya bhar main jahaan maang achaanak kam ho gai he, bharat par iskaa asar kam padaa he
 Especially the things which are directly related to the common man, their demand has not seen much effect
 aankade is baat kii tasdik kar rahe hai
 Take, for example, the mobile connection
 sirf janvari main ek karod 53 lakh logon ne nae conection liye hai, jabaki disambar main ye aankada mahaz ek karod ke aasapaas tha
 Consumption of goods like FMCG sector i
e
 sabun, oil, toothpaste is also increasing
 pichley saal ke mukaable is sector main 26
 4 percent growth has been observed
 auto sector main bhi haal kuch aisa hi he
 It seemed like only two-three months that no one is safe in this sector, but statistics show that the vehicles are being sold
 beshak disambar main gadiyon kii bikri main thodaa brake laga tha, lekin janvari main bikri 32 fisadi bad gai
 In other sectors too, desolation is seen
 makaan kharidne main logon kii ruchi phir se jag rahi he
 This is the reason why the sectors like cement and steel are returning bright
 steel sector main lagaataar teen maheene giravat ke baad bazaar main ek baar phir may 2008 jaisaa maahaul nazar aa rahaa he
 The cement industry also grew by 11 percent over the previous year
 yani kai hafton ke andhere ke baad ummiido kii roshni dikhne lagi he
 Now the need is that when the inflation rate has come down, then interest rates should be reduced and money can be put in the market so that the industry once again returns to its old pace
 ab sawaal ye he ki bharat kii arthvyavastha kya maang rahi he
 If the right decisions are taken at the right time, the impact of the economic slowdown in India will be minimal
 maang bad rahi he to udyog-dhandhe bhi badhenge, naukariyaan bachengi or selary bhi badhegi
 But this is not only necessary for the economy that has been killed in the recession storm
 jarurat is baat kii he ye maang lagaataar bani rahe
 If a storm arises anywhere in the world, its effect must reach us, but lest we also fly in that storm
 lagaataar gir rahi mahangaai dar ne hamen ek mauka diya he
 Today this rate is below four percent
 13 maheene pehle jab aisi sthiti thi, tab hamaari vikaas dar nau fisadi se upar thi, lekin aaj khatra ye he ki wo saat fisadi se bhi neeche ja sakati he
 It is not difficult to find the reason for this danger
 pichley 13 maheenon main udyog ke liye karj par paisa jutanaa aasmaan se taare tod laane jaisaa ho gaya he
 The ever-increasing interest rates have broken the back of big industrial houses
 lakhon chote-mote kaarobaariyon ko dukaan band kerani padi he
 Needless to say how interest has hit the real estate, auto and consumer goods sector
 magar aaj mahangaai kii dar ghatane or antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat teen chauthai tak kam hone ke baad hamaare paas is baat kaa mauka he ki ham apane udyogon or upabhoktaaon ko sasta karj den, utpaadan badhayen, to uske saath-saath khapat badhaane kaa bhi intjaam karen
 Recession has hit people, now let them take advantage of the opportunity created by it
 ghar saste hue hai to aisa maahaul banaaya jaae ki log use kharid paaen
 Iron and cement have become cheaper, if people are given so much money, then they can build their own house
 eendhan sasta hua he to safar bhi sasta karne ke intjaam kiye jaaen
 Also, keep in mind that there is no profit booking under the guise of recession
 sarkaar jo madad de, wo peeche ke daravaaje se kuch logon kii jeb main na chalaa jaae
 Because when the benefit reaches the common man, only then will he dare to defuse the recession
 mandi kii vajah se kai udyog dub gaye to kai badi companiyon ko bhi nuksaan jhelana padaa
 This had a direct impact on people's jobs
 badi sankhya main log berozegaar hue, lekin ek survey ke mutabik bharat main halaat sudharte najar aa rahe hai
 Like abroad, the crisis over jobs also came in his country
 hajaaron logon kii naukariyaan chali gai hai
 The problems have increased for the government just before the election
 kisi kii naukari jane kaa matlab he, vot khisakna
 In such a situation, the government is now telling companies that the salaries of big executives of the company have to be deducted, but the job of the people must be saved
 sarkaar kii chintaa vaazib he, lekin raahat kii baat ye he ki ab bhi kai udyog aise hai jahaan logon kii zarurat bani hui he
 According to a recent survey, 63 percent of the companies in the country are still giving jobs to people and only 13 percent of companies are thinking of retrenchment
 har das main se nau companiyaan apane karmchaariyon ko pramotion bhi de rahi hai or ek fisadi se bhi kam companiyaan tankhwaah main katautee kar rahi hai
 According to the survey, an average of 8 this year in India
 2 fisadi kii dar se tankhwaah badhegi, jo kisi bhi myne main bura nahin he
 Assuming the survey to be true, the pharma sector will increase salaries by 13 per cent, while the telecom sector will increase its salary to 11
 3% fisadi rahegi
 FMCG sectors will also not lag much behind with an increase of 11 per cent
 lekin agar aap retail, iti or banking sector main naukari kar rahe hai to pehle aap apni naukari bachaaen
 Last year, an average of 13 per cent of salary hikes occurred
 is nazariye se dekhen to 8
 The 2 percent hike seems to be less
 lekin iconomi kii maujuuda halaat or duusare deshon kii sthiti ko dekhte hue bharat phir bhi kaaphi behatar sthiti main he
 The survey also shows that average salaries will increase by only 3% in the US and 2% in Japan
 dekhne vaali baat ye he ki tankhwah badhane ke maamle main bharat china se bhi aage he

 isi kaaran ham bhikhaariyon kaa maangane kaa dhandha chhudaane main lage hue hai
 He told that a slogan has been given by the institution 'beggar-free Kashi Apni'
 yaad rahe ki duniyabar se kaashi pahunchane vaale payartkon ke man main is dharmanagari kii behatar chhavi banane kii disha main yahaan kaa prashasan bhi sakriy ho chukaa he

 Last week, Turkey attacked Syria, killing a large number of people and causing thousands to flee
 pichley hafte turki ne seemapar yuddh syria main kurdo ke kabje vaale kshetron main hamalaa kar diya jahaan kurdish logon kii aguwai main syrian dremocratic forces (esadf) kaa shashan he
 Turkey considers the Syrian Dramocratic Forces the largest terrorist organization
 'antaheen ladaai ladane kii jarurat nahin'kai saansadon ne kurd balon ke hataane ke is kadam kii aalochana kii he, jo iesas ke khilaaf ladaai main america kaa ahm sahyogi he
 The Turkish attack was carried out last week after US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from the region
 is hamale main kaaphi log maare bhi gaye
 Donald Trump said, 'we left from there on the grounds that we are going to bring back our great soldiers who are there
 hamen in antaheen yudhon se ladane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 We are bringing them back home
 ' saath hi america raashtrapati ne ummid jataai ki turki or syria kshetra main shanti ke liye kaam karenge
 How many US soldiers in Syria? President Trump said that the Turkish attack on Syria was no surprise to him, for a long time Turkey had been planning for it
 america sainikon kii vaapasi par trump ne kaha ki hamaare zyaadaatar sainik waapas laut chuke hai
 We think there are 28 soldiers there, but less than 50
 jo ek behad choti sena he
 He further said, 'I campaigned for the return of my soldiers, and that is why i am striving for it

 Donald Trump has also started his action in this regard and has increased the steel tariff for Turkey
 saath hi 100 million yues dollar kii deal ko khatm karne kaa elaan kar diya
 More than a week has passed since Turkey attacked Syria's Kurdish areas

 69 civilians have also died in Syria
 turki ke mutabik is hamale main uske 6 sainik maare gaye hai jabaki uske 20 naagarik bhi kurdon ke javaabi hamale main mare hai
 Control of the SDF since 2015, officials say, the withdrawal of US troops from Syria provided a green signal for Turkey to attack
 2011 main shuru hue grih yuddh ke parinamswaroop adhikansh kshetra syrian sarkaar ke niyantran se baahar ho gaye or ise 2015 se esadf dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The SDF has been a major ally of the US in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group but Turkey considers the sdf's Kurdish fighters to be 'terrorists' who support the anti-turkish insurgency
 turki ne kurd ladaakon se mukt 'surakshit kshetra' banane kii baat kahkar apane kadam kaa bachaav kiya, jo syrian sharnaarthiyon ko sharan bhi de saktaa he
 After the attack, Turkish President Erdogan said last week that we will not stop it no matter what they say

 Facts about black money may not be available very much, but everyone has some opinion about it
 zyaadaatar logon kii raay to yahi he ki kaala dhan bahut badi maatra main he
 People who work in the media have white money
 isliye prabal sambhaavna he ki ve is raay ko maan lenge
 But where does this opinion stand on the basis of logic? The traditional definition of black money says that it is income on which tax has not been paid
 agar ise upbhog kii vastuon par kharch kar diya jaae, to yah hameshaa ke liye hawa main gum ho jaaegi
 Black money can be discovered and identified only when it is planted in a permanent or durable asset
 khub sara paisa banane vaale log murkh nahin hai; ve aanshik bhugtan safed dhan se karenge, taaki sampatti vaidhanik ban jaae
 This means that in most cases of black money, the price is undervalued
 electronic len-dein se pehle share bazaaron main nakad saude aam baat the
 Nowadays cash transactions in financial assets are feasting on many problems
 lihaaja sambhaavna yahi he ki bharat main kaale dhan kaa bada hissaa real estate saudon main laga ho
 Generally corporate companies and wealthy taxpayers also prefer to pay for real estate from white money itself; And the builders are also happy to take payment from the check for new property, because they too have to spend many expenses with white money
 sambhaavna yahi he ki zyaadaatar kaale dhan kaa istemaal sampatti kii baad main hone vaali kharid-farokht main hota ho
 The government gets half per cent of GDP from property tax
 yah kaaphi kam he —brick deshon main yah ausat 1
 2 per cent and 1 in G20 countries
 9 fisadi he
 This is not because property prices in India are low, or property taxes are high
 hindustani log sampatti kii kharid-farokht bhi khub karte hai—yah unki sabase pasandida tikaoo puunji he
 So it is common to tell the property price down
 darasal ham kah sakate hai ki apni sampatti kii keemat kam bataanaa bharat main kaale dhan kaa sabase aam tarika he
 It is so common that no one gets angry about it
 videshon main rakhe kaale dhan par unhen gussa aata he kyonki ise behad amir legon ke ek bahut chote-se varg kaa vishesh adhikaar mana jaataa he
 There have been many speculations about black money
 pehali koshish 1985 main vishwa bank kii valrd deveopment report main kii gai thi
 Every country has its own currency
 lihaaja mudraon ke bich vinimay kii utani hi sambhaavnaaen hai jitani ki karency ke peyar hai
 For many decades, governments have been concerned about the balance of payments, which is the essence of the risks of such transactions
 yahi kaaran he ki ve sone yaa videshi mudraon ke bhandar apane paas rakhti hai taaki jarurat padane par bhugtan santulan ko apane paksh main jhukaa saken
 Some industrialized countries no longer do this, but they still keep accounts of the balance of payments figures
 alabatta ye aankade santulan ke kaam kabhi nahin aate
 There is a residual entry in all figures of the balance of payments, which is called a mistake
 kaale dhan ke shuruaati jhdabardaaron ne maan liya tha ki kaala dhan isi bhul-chook se aata he
 The figures of currency pairs of countries are never the same
 misaal ke taur par baltistan kaa bharat se aayaat or bharat se baltistan ko niryaat main fark he
 Other black money lords admit that this difference (after adjusting for freight and insurance costs within the country) is due to manipulation of bills and is therefore the father of black money
 pratispardhaa or moulik taur-tareekon main arthshaastriyon kaa koi jawaab nahin
 So others devised new guessing techniques
 misaal ke taur par, agar desh ke baahar kiye gaye nivesh par desh ke bheetar aane vaale byaaj kii daren kam hai to yah maan liya gaya ki jarur koi na koi videsh main byaaj chipa rahaa hoga
 It would be my ignorance to say that no one secretly sends money abroad
 jab tak sarkaar sone par aayaat shulk vasuul karti rahegi, sone kii taskari behad phaayde kaa dhandha bani rahegi
 The smuggling routes that Dawood Ibrahim & Co created in the 1980s are still open to entrepreneurs
 lekin sone kii taskari kii baat chhod bhi den, to mujhe koi kaaran dikhaai nahin detaa ki amir hindustani hawala kii madad lenaa chahenge
 a rich man can avoid all kinds of tax by keeping his wealth in insufficient capital gains
 or agar vah puunjigat laabh praapt bhi kar le to use keval 10 fisadi dhanrashi chukaani padati he
 There are simple and legitimate ways to take your money abroad
 bhartiya rigerv bank bagaiyr koi sawaal puche ham sabko har saal 1,25,000 dollar videsh main rakhane kii ijaajat detaa he
 He lets us invest abroad; We just have to tell our bank about it
 agar yah bhi kaaphi na ho, to koi videsh main jo chaahe vah kar saktaa he, basharte vah bharat main ek vitt varsh main 182 dinon se zyada na rahata ho
 If one does not like to live like 'not ordinarily resident', then there are a number of countries across the border which will give residence or nationality to wealthy Indians
 so kaale dhan kaa sahaara lene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 But who has control over someone's thinking
 agar koi yah maananaa hi chahta he ki arabon-kharbon ru
 If kept in hiding abroad, then he is free to choose his own choice

 congress aatmamanthan ke liye nahin jaani jaati
 Instead of that, she prefers such a process of factionalism, which takes the form of unity through sycophancy everywhere
 or aise main akl kii baat sirf madar godes sonia hi kar sakati hai
 When they intervene, the Congress is obliged to listen to it and follow their words
 ve nai patakatha likhti hai to usamen se jhaankate andeh or aspashtataa ko party ke log congress ke andruni sangharsh kii abhivyakti maan lete hai
 In spite of all this, consider the speech of Sonia Gandhi in Jaipur, it gives a glimpse of a respected institution - a party which was really involved in nation building and after that the alliance got molded
 varshon pehle pramukh raajnneetishastri rajani kothaari ne congress ko ek sookshm bharat kii sangya di thi
 The Congress not only gave direction to the country, but also decided the language and analogies of democratic politics
 ham sonia se yah to ummid nahin kar sakate ki ve kothaari kii tarah belaag tareeke se sach ko saamne rakh dengi, lekin congress adhyaksh ke bhaashan main un bhavi paimaanon kii jhalak bakhubi milti he jinke aadhaar par party khud ko samajhane kaa prayaas karegi
 The path that Sonia is pointing towards today, perhaps the party will follow the same tomorrow
 congress ko lekar aam logon main jo koft he un par sonia kaa kya rukh he? ek baat ekadam saaf he
 Congress is still following the path of dynastic democracy
 yadi aaj sonia ke haath satta he to kal rahul raaj karenge
 Yet there is considerable scope for interest in Sonia's speech
 sabase pehali baat, party kii vichaardhaara main badlaav
 Clearly, the point is that whatever was best for the Congress tomorrow, it will not remain the same in the coming time
 udhaaharan ke liye, sonia ne yah mana ki manaregaa ke aasapaas kaa tilsm tut rahaa he
 It was successful in rural areas, but it did not increase the party's urban voters
 vyaavhaarikta ne sonia gandhi ko ehsaas kara diya he ki ab kaushalyukt rojgaar par zyada dhyaan dene kaa vakt aa gaya he taaki congress kii chhavi nivesh ke liye behatar maahaul taiyaar karne vaali party ke rup main ho
 The presence of Congress in some parts of the country is negligible
 aise ilaakon main puri kii puri peedi congress ke achche yaa bure shashan ko dekhe bagaiyr badi ho gai
 The best example of this is Gujarat where the Congress has been out of power for almost two decades
 iske alaava congress kii chintaa kaa vishay yah bhi he ki andhra pradesh jaise uske paramparaagat garh main bhi send lag rahi he
 The Congress is shrinking, and as Jairam Ramesh clearly said, the possibility of the Congress coming to power on its own is now far-fetched
 party ke rasmi aatmvishleshan ke dauraan teen saamaajik virgon par khaas dhyaan diya gaya he-pehla, madhyam varg jise congress apana chunavi aadhaar bananaa chaahati he, saath hi apane abhiyaan ko ek nai praasangikta dene ke liye yuva or mahilaon ko bhi ahmiyat de rahi he
 The Congress believes that women are not the problem, but its central power
 party ke sadasyon kii fehrist main congress kii vistrut saamaajik kalpana kii jhalak milani chahie or prakhand se rashtriya str tak mahilaon or unase jude muddon ko pesh kiya janaa chahie, saath hi yah bhi joda ki in muddon ko mahila congress yaa sambandhit mahila sanghathanon kii jimmedaari par nahin choda ja saktaa
 Sonia has raised the fundamental change in the ideology of the male dominated party
 unka saaf maananaa he ki kisi samaaj ke liye mahilaon se jude mudde ahm hai, to siyaasi party ke rup main congress ke liye bhi ve ahm hone chahie
 The contemplation camp was introspection to teach citizenship lessons to the Congress
 yah videsh niti, sanghathan ke muddon, mahila shashaktikaran or rajnatik chunautiyon ke vibhinn khandon main banta hua tha
 Still, there was little scope for doubt, new ideas, innovative politics
 maano ranneeti par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke bajaae yuktiyon ke prayog par kitaabi bhaashan ho
 Whether the speech was from Sonia Gandhi, the Prime Minister or Kamal Nath, it seemed that everything had already been known as if an old cassette was running in which it is difficult to distinguish between the occasional and the relevant
 sonia ke bhaashan main congress main chhaae vaastavik sankat kaa sanket dikhaa
 No response to a crisis is breathtaking
 chintan shivar main gahare vishleshan, santhnik darshan or sanghathan main badlaav kii kami thi
 Sonia played the role of Professor of Congress College and Rahul as a dedicated tutor, who was doing his work in all relevant sections
 congress ko bas vahi ghisi-pity baaten doharaani aati hai
 The introspecting party must have a soul, historical and moral memory to realize what it has become
 jo dikhataa he vah satta paane kii akulaahat jisamen jimmedaariyon kaa saamana karne kaa saahas nahin
 The Congress suddenly appears to be a decent party which will have to maintain decency in many cases
 lekhak jane-maane samajashastri hai or kai vishvavidhyalayon main padhaa chuke hai Preparations have been made to open the grounds of schools in Delhi to which the DDA has given land to the surrounding children after the holiday

 jin skulon ko didie ne riyayati daron par jameen di he unke maidaanon ko skool khatm hone ke baad aasapaas ke bacchon ke liye khol diya janaa chahie

 Former French President François Hollande claimed in an interview that the Modi government had proposed to make Reliance Defense a partner
 vahiin, france sarkaar ne is par safai di he
 Hollande has revealed in the interview that the Dassault company spoke to the service group India named
 oland kaa kahana he ki dasolt ne rilanyas group ke anil ambani se sampark kiya
 France had no other option
 vahiin, france sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dasolt ne khud bharat kii reliance dephence kaa chunaav kiya
 In an exclusive interview to India Today TV, the journalist interviewing former French President François Hollande said, "it is wrong for India to say that the Indian and French governments were not involved in the deal between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defense
" francwa oland kaa intervyuu lene vaale patrkaar anton rogat ne kaha ki oland ne spasht rup se kaha tha ki bharat sarkaar ne francisi adhikariyon ko reliance dephence kaa naam prastaavit kiya tha
 Read the highlights of the interview
 
 
 india today tivi:purv francisi raashtrapati oland ne aapako die intervyuu main rafel saude or anil ambani ke reliance dephence ke bare main kya bataaya?anton rogat:purv francisi raashtrapati jo dasolt aviation or reliance dephence ke bicharafail dealpar hastakshar karne ke liye offis main maujuud the, unhone saaf taur par bataaya tha ki bharat sarkaar ne reliance kaa naam francisi adhikariyon ko prastaavit kiya he
 François Hollande claimed in the interview that the Modi government had proposed to partner Reliance Defense
 india today tivi:bhartiya sarkaar dwaara prastaavit reliance dephence kaa naam prastaavit karne ke peeche oland ne kya kaaran bataaya?anton rogat:unhone hamen bharat sarkaar ke uddeshyon ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya
 We do not know whether Hollande knew anything about this
 vahiin francisi adhikariyon ne ise isliye sweekaar kar liya kyonki rafel deal france ke liye mahatvapurn thi
 India Today TV: What did Ambani's Reliance Entertainment and Hollande's close Julie Gayet's film revealed? Holland Rogat: Deal's film connection also gave information
 unhone apni sahyogi juli gammet kii film kaa reliance antertenment se koi conection hone se inkaar kiya
 Hollande said that the film and Rafael Deal had nothing to do with each other
 india today tivi:purv francisi raashtrapati se yah baatcheet kab hui?anton rogat:is hafte unase do baar baatcheet hui
 Significantly, after Hollande's statement on the Rafale Deal, there is a fierce rhetoric
 france sarkaarne saaf kaha he ki french company ko puri azaadi thi or company ne khud hi is qaraar ke liye reliance dephence ko chunaa
 At the same time, the company has also said in its clarification that its CEO himself had chosen Reliance under Make in India
 yani ab france sarkaar or french company ek ho gai hai or oland apane bayaan kii vajah se akele pad gaye hai

 Afzal came to Delhi the same night
 aglaa din ravivaar tha
 Since morning i once again stood outside the office of the Special Cell
 main phone par lagaataar special cell ke asipi rajbir, disipi ashok chand or kamishnar ajayraj sharma se sampark main tha
 In the afternoon we were told that the visuals of Afzal and the other three of his fellow detained with him would be allowed to shoot us

 All three had handcuffs
 teenon shaayad pehali baar camere kaa saamana kar rahe the
 i was constantly trying for interviews
 19 disambar ko achaanak asipi rajbir ne mujhase kaha ki phikr mat karo, intervyuu mil jayega
 Home Minister LK Advani himself wants the whole country to know the truth of the Parliament attack accused
 disipi ashok chand ne bhi kaha ki ek baar upar se order aane do, intervyuu ho jayega
 On Thursday, December 20, i was standing outside the Special Cell office since morning

 i understand that the order has arrived from above
 daftar main rajbir apni kursi par baitha tha
 Sit me in front and then tell that Afzal Guru is going to come in this room, set your camera
 maine poocha baaki teenon? rajbir ne kaha ki main afjal hi he isliye sirf vahi bolegaa
 Rajbir said, "I too will remain in the room and the question or answer that is not right will be removed later
" maine hami bhar lee
 After this, the soldiers of the special cell brought Afzal around one and a half in the afternoon and he was seated on the chair in front of me
 afjal ke bal karine se saje the, shev shaayad kuch der pehle hi karaayaa gaya tha
 It was as if he had been washed and brought

 Asked about Gilani, what was his role in the Parliament attack? At the same time, Rajbir got a call from someone, so he could not hear my question
 lekin phone rakhane ke baad iskaa jawaab sun chukaa tha
 After this, Rajbir suddenly gestured and asked to end the interview
 iske baad jaise hi hamaara camera band hua, usne afjal ko danta ki vah gilaani ke bare main kyon bol rahaa tha
 After that the ACP told me that i kept my promise
 ab aapaki baari he
 Please remove the line interview with Gilani
 rajbir ham sabko khabaren diya karata tha
 i did not want to resent that source
 isliye us shaam jab yah intervyuu ajtak par telecast hua to maine ve line hataa deen
 i didn't really realize at that time that this line could have any significance
 magar sansad hamale ke chah maheene puure hone par ajtak ne afjal kaa vahi intervyuu phir se chalaaya
 By then i had forgotten that Gilani's line had to be removed
 tab afjal kaa puraa intervyuu chal gaya, jisamen afjal kah rahaa tha ki sansad par hamale ke bare main gilaani ko koi jaankaree nahin thi or vah bekasoor he
 Then one day Justice S

 Inside the court was ACP Rajbir and his entire team of Special Cell

 After watching the entire interview in the court, Justice Dhingra asked me why i had dropped Gilani's talk from the interview in the first place
 maine bataaya ki aisa maine rajbir ke kehane par kiya tha
 When i asked Afzal that Indian Muslims are viewed with suspicion because of the terrorism you are spreading, he said, "I realize that because of people like us, Muslims of India suffer

 unke samarthakon ne ek fasebuk group banaaya or kuch der kii charchaa ke baad faisla kiya gaya ki avijit ke mishan, unke aalochakon or unki hatya par ek choti-si film banaai jaae
 The idea was that Avijit's death should be seen as part of a well-thought out mass murder campaign that began with the killing of 900 teachers during the 1971 liberation struggle
 or ab dharmanirpeksh blogar uskaa sabase taaja nishaanaa hai

 But do you know who makes the tricolor hoisted in the country and the world? Do you know how a tricolor is prepared? There is only one answer to all these questions

 It is this unit that is the only unit of the Karkadi Khadi Gramodyog Samyukta Federation (KKGSS Federation), which produces the tricolor that is hoisted in the country and the world
 sangh ke sachiv shivanand nexjtak
 KKGSS is the only authorized national flag manufacturing unit in the country certified by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission
 yah unit karnataka ke hubli shahar main he
 Khadi manufactures since 1982: Although this association was established in 1957, it started making Khadi from 1982

 The federation received certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in 2005–06
 tab se isane tirangaa taiyaar karne kaa kaam shuru kiya
 BIS only checks the quality of the tricolor being prepared here
 shivanand bataate hai ki kareeb 18 tarah ke quality check hote hai

 Sivananda explains that only cotton and khadi are used to make the tricolor
 sabhi jaruri quality check paas karne ke baad hi tirange ko unit se baahar bheja jaataa he
 Much more care has to be taken: Sivananda explains that much caution is required while preparing the tricolor
 biies or keviisi dwaara nirdhaarit rangon main hi ise taiyaar karnaa padataa he
 Which color is in what proportion, it is all decided
 tirange par ashok chakra ke aakaar or anya maanak ko lekar bhi niyam tay hai
