 The pen drive was snatched from my hand

 That is why she says that 'now SIT can protect that pen drive
 ladki aage kahati he kii jab tak pen drive mere paas thi, surakshit thi
 Chinmayanand's lawyer Om Singh told NDTV about the video, 'the student was yesterday saying that she had been staying in the hostel for the past one year

 Because for one year she was staying in hostel and the video is of 2014
 to yah pratham drushtya hi pataa chalata he kii vah video puri tarah se phek he
 It is created by animation from a computer
 yah swami ji kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 And this is not the first video

 The SIT is investigating the Chinmayananda case
 lekin esaiti is bare main tipanni karne se batch rahi he

 chidambaram kii musiibat khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Today the CBI remand is ending, so the petition was to be heard in the Supreme Court

 The forests of Uttarakhand, the Himalayan state of the country, are under fire these days
 uttarakhand ke kumaun or gadhwal donon kshetron ke saikadon chote-bade jangalon main aag lagi hui he
 According to the forest department, since the onset of summer in these forests, about one thousand incidents of fire have been recorded, affecting about 2400 hectares of forest area
 jangalon main aag lagane kii ghatnaayen nai nahin hai
 Many times, the forests themselves have been set on fire in a controlled manner to produce good grass
 lekin in dinon jangalon kii aag vikaraal rup dhaaran karti ja rahi he, jo kai baar hafton tak jari rahati he
 Many times this fire is extinguished only after it rains
 jangal matlab sirf ped nahinchipako andolan ke activist or forest korporation main adhikari rahe vinod pandey kehete hai pehle to jangalon kaa matlab sirf ped maanane vaali soch ko badalanaa hoga
 He says that in addition to trees in the forests, there are plants, vines, vines, mushrooms, roots and hundreds of animals
 jangal in sabase milakar banataa he or aag lagane par in chote jeevon or vanaspatiyon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchataa he
 In the face of the changed forests by the British, the elimination of forests started from the British era itself
 angrejon ne desh main rail line bichaane or lisa (resin) hasil karne ke liye jangalon main chid ke pedo ko ropana shuru kiya
 This led to the end of mixed forests in Uttarakhand and the pine forests spread all around
 chid ke na galane vaale pattey jangal kii mitti main nami ko rokane main naakaam rahe or jangalon kii biodivarsity khatm karne kii badi vajah bane
 Vinod Pandey says that these forests have suffered pine trees for 60-70 years, but today the situation is ending for the pine trees and now the Mexican Devil (black Bansa) has started coming here
 jangalon ke liye phydemand hoti he aagyah sunne main ajeeb lagegaa, lekin aag kai myanon main jangalon ke liye phydemand sabit hoti ai he
 Fire has been considered part of forest ecology
 jangalon main kai kismon kii ghaas ke beej ke khol kaaphi sakht hote hai
 The process of germination begins in these seeds only after breaking down with light roasting
 inamen uttarakhand main paae jane vaale kafal (myrica Esculenta) kaa beej bhi shaamil he
 Fire has always been a part of silviculture
 isliye yah kahana sarleekaran karnaa hoga ki jangalon main aag lakdi ke taskar lagaate hai
 Read: jungle-jungle is on fire
 
 
 saal main lakhon baar lagi he
 
 
 Jungles used to extinguish their own fires, till some time ago, the forests used to control their fires themselves
 ab aisa na ho paane kii vajah jangalon main khatm hoti nami he
 The forests that protect themselves with the help of their resistance for thousands of millions of years are becoming weaker today
 jangal barish ke pani ko sahejkar apni jameen main nami banaae rakhte the
 The leaves falling from the trees played an important role in this work
 chid ke ped aa jane se iske pattey jangalon ko sukhaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Rajeev Lochan Sah, a senior journalist and editor of Nainital News, who had three major reasons for forest fires being out of control, says that in the past, there was a mutual relationship between the forests, forest department and local residents and people grew up in the fire extinguishing work
 Used to take baad main jangalon main jane par pratibandh lagane or vanavaasiyon ke adhikaar kam hone se yah sambandh tuutata chalaa gaya
 The second reason for the fire being uncontrolled is the migration of villages in Uttarakhand
 ab aag bujhane main haath bantane ke liye gaanv main log hi nahin bache hai
 The third reason, Vinod Pandey, states that officers are five times required in the forest department, but more than one-third of the forest guards who extinguish the fire are vacant
 kahaan peeche rah gaye hamavinod pandey bataate hai ki aaj aag bujhane ke naam par maikenical prayaas ho rahe hai, inhen biological prayaason main badalanaa hoga
 Only by changing the biodiversity of the forests will they be able to stop the fire
 jangalon kii biodivarsity naapane kii takanic aaj tak hamaare paas nahin he
 The damage to biodiversity of forests is never anticipated after a fire
 vah kehete hai ki jangal kii aag ko pani chhidakkar nahin bujhaayaa ja saktaa he, inke liye hamen phir se jangalon ko sakasham bananaa hoga
 Instead of pine trees, we have to give mixed forests a place in the forests again

 Congress, which has done politics with the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, has now prepared to take a big political step on the occasion of Gandhi's birth anniversary, ie, October 2
 party ne iske liye khaastaur par mahatma gandhi ke aakhri vakt ke maharashtra ke wardha zile main sthit nivas sewagram ko chunaa he
 In fact, Sevagram was the residence of Mahatma Gandhi from 1936 till the last time and it was from here that he started the fight against the British
 1942 main angrejon bharat chodo kii pariklpana bhi gandhi ji ne sewagram kii kutiyaa main hi kii thi
 In such a situation, the Congress is preparing to launch a political attack on the government on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 2018

 isi aadhaar par modi sarkaar ke khilaaf wo in naaron ke saath morcha kholane kaa man bana chuki he
 At the same time, the Congress will also attack that there was no contribution of the leaders of the RSS or BJP in the fight for independence, on the contrary, the BJP which is using the name of Mahatma Gandhi today, he is a supporter of the ideology of his killer Godse
 iske alaava party kaa ye ilzaam bhi hoga ki jin sardaar patel kaa aaj bijepi naam le rahi he, unheen patel ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke baad grahamantri rahete aresas par bain lagaaya tha
 The Congress engaged in encircling the BJP in the name of Mahatma Gandhi, on the whole, Prime Minister Modi will be doing a big program in the name of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, then the Congress will also be busy in encircling the BJP in the name of Mahatma Gandhi

 Kangana Ranaut and Hrithik Roshan's contravention was at a standstill for some time
 lekin yah vivaad ab ek baar phir se uthaa he
 Kangana's sister Rangoli has posted a video on her Twitter account
 jisamen actress ke vakil rigwan siddhiki rithik ke jhooth kaa pardaafash karte dikhe
 Let me tell you, recently, Hrithik Roshan interviewed a news channel on this controversy

 The actor claimed that he had not met Kangna for 1 year since October 2013
 isapar kangana ke vakil ne kuch video pruf ke taur par dikhaae hai
 He showed some photos from 2013 where Hrithik and his family were present at Kangana's birthday party

 Advocate Rizwan Siddiqui asked Hrithik why he did not show passport details between December 2013 and January 2014
 bataa den, rithik ne daawa kiya tha ki vah janvari 2014 main paris nahin gaye the
 Hrithik also showed his passport

 australia ke cricketer david warner or south africa ballebaaj quinton di cock vivaad main ab mahaan australian gendbaaj shen worne bhi kud pade hai
 Warne said on the tussle between the two players that the players should stop complaining about it
 shen warn ne kaha ki khilaadiyon ko vyaktigat tippanee karne se bachanaa chahie or saath milakar ek bear pikar vivaad kaa nipataara karnaa chahie
 Warne tweeted, "talking, joking and splattering have always been part of any series between South Africa and Australia, both teams always deal with it
" ’diggaj spinner worne ne kaha ki iske liye sabase ahm cheez sammaan he or ummid karata hum ki donon tiimon kii ore se kisi ke liye bhi kisi khilaadi ne koi vyaktigat baat nahin kii
 Take beer together and get back to work
 iske bare main shikaayat karnaa band karo
 Former players hired former Raisingland captain Michael Vaughan said that Warner's image was of a sneering player and it was just a matter of time as they insulted each other
 won ne kaha, ‘bilkul sahi worne, lekin yah saaf he ki kaaphi vyaktigat bakawaas kahi gayi or jis khilaadi par sawaal uth rahe hai usne kaaphi samay tak aisa kiya isaliye mujhe lagata he ki koi khilaadi aahat hone ke baad hi pratikriya karata he
 In this case, South African manager Mohammad Musaji also blamed Warner
 is par maaikel won ne kaha, ‘maidan par kuch shabd bole gayi the, agar aap kuch bol rahe ho to aapmen isaki pratikriya sunne kii sahanshakti bhi honi chahie or quinton kii raay yahi thi
 Great Australian player Adam Gilchrist also expressed his opinion on Twitter and he said, "I can only guess that a very personal thing was said to David Warner, when he gave such a response, it is not good at all
" ’dakshin africa ke purv captain greem smith bhi isse sahamat the ki yah cricket ke liye acha nahin he lekin unhone gilcrist ko online jawaab dete hue kaha ki iske liye warner khud hi jimmedaar hai
 He said, 'gilly, look Warner has broken many personal boundaries with South African players, so we cannot be surprised to see this reaction
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘agar khilaadi kuch bolte hai to unhen sunne ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 "what is the matter?" The players of both teams were returning to the dressing room after tea on the fourth day of the Test match between South Africa and Australia in Durban, when Australian vice-captain David Warner and South African wicket-keeper batsman Quinton de Kock clashed
 is ghatana kaa sisitivi footage saamne aane ke baad cricket australia (sie) ne jaanch shuru kar di he
 It can be seen in the video that while returning to the dressing room, Warner is furious and is seen flaming De Cock

 Comment on the wife? According to the report, De Cock commented on Warner's wife Candice, after which he lost his temper
 haalanki dakshin africa khilaadi ne is bahes ko badhaane ke liye warner doshi tehraaya
 Now the decision on this is to take the match referee Jeff Crowe

 The BJP has now begun to surround the Aam Aadmi Party with its biggest identity, honest and anti-corruption image
 aam aadmi party ko mili chande main gadbadiyon ke aarope lagane se bijepi ko mauka bhi mil gaya
 As soon as the suspended AAP MLA Devendra Sehrawat accused Golmaal in funding, BJP did not take any time to wash hands in the flowing Ganga
 turant bijepi kii taraf se bhi bayaan jari ho gaya ki ab aap kii eemaandaaree kaa khol fatne laga he
 The BJP said that since the day the Aam Aadmi Party was formed, there have been a lot of pockets in the name of donations
 hairaani kii baat he ki dinabhar raajnneetik galiyaaron main chande ke naam par lag rahegadabadiyonaropon kii charchaa hoti rahi, lekin aam aadmi party kii taraf se koi bhi netaa pratikriya dene se bachataa rahaa
 BJP national minister RP Singh said that the Aam Aadmi Party has nothing left in its defense, because the income tax department's papers are telling everything
 unhone kaha ki aam logon se chanda lekar chunaav ladane kii aad main party ne bahut gadabadiyaan kii hai or ab unki hi party ke andruni log hi isko saamne laa rahe hai
 In the past, there have been many such cases, when the whereabouts of the donors have turned out to be fake, and now it is also coming to the fore that the income tax department and elections are referring to the money of those who paid a large amount in donations
 The information given to the Commission is not included in the information
 iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki kahin na kahin koi bada ghalmail he
 Shyamlal Garg, treasurer of Delhi BJP, says that his party also gets donations, but the account is clear, we show where it comes from
 lekin in logon ko kahaan se paisa aata he or kahaan se dikhaate hai, isamen koi talmail hi nahin he
 Earlier too, there have been allegations that money comes from abroad, now the same truth is coming out of the messes that have come
 vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne to aam aadmi party ko mili chande kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii he
 According to Gupta, the list of donations made by the Aam Aadmi Party on its website was hidden from the Income Tax Department

 The manipulation of crores of rupees should be investigated by the CBI

 crisil ne ek adhyayan main kaha ki kisi ek timahi main mudra kii vinimay daron main utaar-chadhaav ke chalate yah sabase bada nuksaan he

 As the 2019 general election draws to a close, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its powerful Prime Minister Narendra Modi are suddenly beginning to look weak — especially after one defeat in the by-elections and some close contests in the party's strongholds
 vipakshi dalon ne bhaanp liya he ki agar ve apane vot bainkon ko ek-duusare ke saath milaane kaa koi tarika khoj nikaalen to ve centre main lagaataar duusari baar sarkaar banane kii bhaajapa kii ummiido ko chakanachur kar sakate hai
 Mamta achieved the status of 'giant Killer' in 2011 by ending the cpi-m's 34-year rule in the state
 phir 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone 42 main se 34 siton par apni party akhil bhartiya trinmul congress (tiemasi) kii jeet pakki kii
 Not only this, he won the mandate in the 2016 assembly elections with an overwhelming majority for a second term as Chief Minister
 ek ke baad ek jeet ke is silsile ne mamata ko apane dam par rashtriya netaa ke taur par sthapit kar diya
 With her long-standing experience in politics and government — she has been a seven-time MP and during this time she served as a minister in the three central governments of both the NDA and the UPA — and now the bjp's strong chariot grew
 By offering to pause, Mamata has emerged as the top challenger for Modi's strength and ambition to be re-elected in 2019
 kya ve pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaar bananaa chaah rahi hai? is sawaal kaa mamata golmol jawaab detii hai
 When India Today asked this question in a special conversation, Mamata's answer was, "this is a very stupid question
 pehle to main kahuungi ki meri koi manshaa nahin he
 i am a simple person and am happy with my work
 magar ham ek samuhik parivaar ke sadsy hone ke naate har kisi kii madad karnaa chaahate hai
 Instead of preparing for the prime ministerial candidate, let us work together
 ''to kya ve khud ko pradhanmantri pad kii daud se baahar kar rahi hai? yah poochne par unhone kaha, "kisi ko bhi baahar karne vaali main koun hoti hum? main jaanati hum ki apane itane sangharshon ke baad main tajurbekaar netaa hum, bahut varisht netaa hum
 i have been MP seven times, MLA twice and CM twice
 isliye main aisi koi baat nahin kah sakati jo dusron ko nagavar gujarey'' (dekhen baatcheet— "bhaajapa kii nafrat kii raajnneeti ne desh ko barbaad kar daalaa he'')
 Mamta is acutely aware of the enormous challenge facing the opposition parties to add a strong alliance
 aisa gathbandhan jo narendra modi-amit shah kii us majboot jodi kaa muqabla kar sake jisane 2014 main kaman sanbhaalane ke baad se bhaajapa kii pahunch ko dur-dur tak failaa diya he
 In a recent press interview, Modi had rejected the opposition's efforts for unity, saying, "there is no grand alliance in the opposition
" bas, pradhanmantri pad kii ek mahadaud he
 Mr
 Rahul Gandhi wants to become Prime Minister but TMC will not agree
 mamata ji pradhanmantri bananaa chaahati hai par usase vamapanthiyon ko dikkat he
 The SP thinks that their leader has more right to become Prime Minister than any other
 puraa dhyaan satta kii raajnneeti par he, logon kii tarakkee par nahin
 Hatred towards Modi is the only force connecting the opposition
 '' modi kii baat main dam he or mamata yah jaanati hai
 Their job is to unite scattered forces, find a common agenda and create a credible bureaucracy that can convince the voters of the country that the opposition can run this country far better than Modi and his colleagues
 mamata ko is baat kaa shrey jaataa he ki ve pichley teen saal se vipakshi gathbandhan kii aguai kii bhoomika sanbhaalane kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 He planted the seeds of this initiative at his swearing-in ceremony in May 2016, when he invited all national leaders who were not only critical critics of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar, but also "remove Modi, defeat BJP"
 'the blueprints of the program are also ready to be made
 is samaaroh main hissaa lene vaale netaaon main bihar ke chunaavon main mahagathbandhan kii kamyaabi se taaja-taaja nikhare lalu prasad yadav, neshnal conference ke faruk abdulla, us vakt uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav, dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, dramuk netaa kanimojhi or telegu desham party ke netaa thota narsinghm shaamil the
 He got a big chance to campaign against Modi and national base after five months on 8 November 2016, when the Prime Minister made a strong surgical strike on black money by closing big notes
 mamata isaki bhartsana karne vaale bilkul pehle vipakshi netaaon main hai jinhone kaha ki yah bahut beraham or sakht kadam he jiske natijatan keval museebataan hi aaengi or bhaajapa ko motaa dhan jutaney main madad milegi
 He realized the need to show sympathy to the unorganized sector, especially to the farmers and small traders who had to suffer the most for this step of the government
 chunaav vishleshak or rabindra bharti vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor biswanath chakravarti kehete hai, "yah saaf-saaf modi ke saath takaraav lene kaa maamla tha, yahaan tak ki vittiya ghotaalon ke aaropon main fanse apni party ke kuch netaaon ko daanv par lagane kii keemat par bhi
 Apart from her national credentials, she was trying to prove that the CBI was being used against her in a spirit of political vendetta by waging a fight with Modi
 ''agar yah vaaki unki ranneeti thi, to yah bhavishyadarshi thi
 In January 2017, CBI arrested TMC leader Sudip Bandopadhyay in the Lok Sabha case related to the Rose Valley Chit Fund scam
 baikfoot par jane kii bajaae mamata ne modi ke khilaaf shorgul badha diya or chunauti di ki agar himmat he to unhen or party ke duusare netaaon ko giraftaar karke dikhaaen
 Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election results in March 2017 gave a clear mandate to the policies of Modi and the BJP
 isse notebandi ke khilaaf vipaksh kaa tikhaa ninda abhiyaan khokhla najar aane laga
 After this defeat, his Hamarah Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) were forced to look inward
 magar mamata bedadak dati raheen
 Some four months later, the Modi government brought the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 isane unhen bhaajapa kii aguai vaali endie sarkaar par nae sire se hamalaa bolne ke liye gola-barood muhaiyaa kara diya
 He supported the GST, but the government was responsible for its poor implementation
 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf jang chhedane ke liye unhen kuch or bade mudde bhi mil gaye, chaahe vah niztaa ke adhikaar ko lekar uthaa vivaad ho yaa aadhaar ko sarkari kalyaan yojanaon, peedies or mobile numberon se jodne kaa vivaad ho, raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar kaa vivaad ho yaa rohingya sharnaarthiyon ko waapas bhejne kaa, swayambhu gaurakshakon kaa maamla ho yaa skulon, collejon or vishvavidhyalayon main khaas maukon par modi ke bhaashan bajaane ke echaradi mantralay ke farmaan sareekhe mudde hon
 Mamata always came forward and did a lot of shame for BJP and Central Government
 magar chautarafa dur-dur tak apni nazren daudaate hue bhi mamata puri ehtiyaat se rajya ke vikaas par bhi dhyaan de rahi thim or ise aise model ke taur par pesh kar rahi thim jiskaa anusaran duusare kar saken
 In her first term, however, she was burdened by the huge debt that the CPI (M) government had left behind
 phir bhi unhone garib-gurbon kii madad karne kii khatir bachche, khaskar bacchiyon kii, ain paidaaish se lekar shiksha, poshan or sehat, shaadi, awaas tak or yahaan tak ki besahaara pariwaron ko apane mritkon ko jalaane yaa dafnane ke liye rokade kii sahaayta tak vibhinn bahurangi kalyaan yojanaon kaa elaan kiya
 Apart from the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, he also helped the minority Muslims (27 per cent of the population of West Bengal is Muslim)
 uske baad mamata ne amal kii baarikiyon par dhyaan diya or bade afasarshahon ke saath jilon or prakhand mukhyalayon kii unki yatraaon ne unki apil main or bhi ijapha kar diya
 On the other hand, he made the administration easy and effective by citing the ministries
 isi ke dam par ve daawa karti hai ki unhone saamaajik yojanaon ke vaaste rakam jutaney ke liye rajasav main khaasi badhotaree kii he
 In her second term, Mamata is focusing on building infrastructure, boosting industrial development and providing jobs to the youth
 unhone apni udyog-virdohi or sudhaar-virdohi hone kii chhavi se chhutkaaraa paa liya he or udyogon ke liye ek bhoomi bank tathaa bhu-upyog kii niti viksit kii he
 They are also getting its benefits
 haal hi main bengal global summit main 2
 35 lakh crore Rs
 ke nivesh prastaav aae
 The government has also increased capital expenditure, especially on infrastructure, and in the last seven years, about Rs 70,000 crore has been spent on building assets in the state
 kharch kiye hai
 Mamta has proudly stated that the state GDP growth rate of 11 in 2017-18
 46 fisadi rahi jo 6
 Was twice the national average of 5 per cent
 isi miyaad main rajya ke audyogic kshetra kii vruddhi dar 4

 Another important point, as state finance minister Amit Mitra points out, is that the state's revenue collection has increased by two and a half times since TMC took over in 2011
 nijee morche par bhi ve pehle se zyada tapi hui or paripakv netaa ke taur par ubhari hai
 He is now seen as a more restrained, practical but rigid administrator than before
 darjeeling pahadiyon main andolan se nipatane or bina koi dabaav daale vidrohi gorkha janamukti morcha ko kinare lagaakar, unhone apane saahas or rajnatik kaushal kaa parichay diya he
 He has shown similar firmness in administration as well
 apni party ke ladakon ke saath bhi unhone koi riyaayat nahin barti
 Strict action was shown on the student leaders of his party who were trying to get money to enroll non-meritorious students in colleges
 jarurat padane par ve bahut sakht or nirdayee bhi ban jaati hai
 Two months ago, he ordered the police to arrest Arbul Islam, a strong leader of the TMC, who was said to be involved in the murder of Hafizul Mulla, a young leader belonging to the opposition party
 24 pargana jile main gram panchayat chunaavon main tiemasi kii jeet tay karne main arbul kii badi bhoomika rahi thi
 Action was taken on a minister who failed to win seats in his district, even the police officers and sps who did not succeed in retaining Mamata's dominance in their constituency were spared
 may main hue panchayat chunaavon ke baad unhone teen mantriyon ko cabinet se baahar kar diya to teen anya mantriyon se unke mantralay le liye or un aath jilon ke jila magistriton or police adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya, jahaan tiemasi yaa to haar gai yaa phir bamushkil kisi prakaar jiti
 However, the opposition, especially the BJP, alleges that Mamta has won the recent panchayat elections on the strength of goons
 panchayat kii 34 pratishat siton par tiemasi ke ummidavaar nirvirodh jeet gaye
 The Supreme Court also raised eyebrows on this and has commented strongly on the West Bengal government
 apana garh bachaane ke baad mamata ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon par dhyaan kendrit kiya he jisamen ab ek saal se bhi kam samay bachaa he
 She is working on a formula to unite the opposition, which she has also revealed in the talks
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri kaa maananaa he ki agar vipaksh jis kshetra main jo majboot ho, uskaa samarthan ke formule par 75 siton ke liye sanyukt ummidavaaron ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he to iskaa bahut bada asar hoga
 She says, "where Congress is strong, fight it, where regional parties are strong, fight them
" ''uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke bich aapasi sahmati kaayam ho janaa mamata kii yojana ke liye bahut mahatvapurn hoga
 In the Lok Sabha elections held in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, it was seen that if the two parties fight together, they can give a big blow to the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, which sends the highest number of mps in the Lok Sabha and most importantly
 mamata kaa maananaa he ki chunaavon ke parinaamon ke baad bhi ek nunatam saajha kaarykram taiyaar ho saktaa he or pradhanmantri koun hoga, is jatil mudde kaa bhi samaadhaan khoja ja saktaa he
 The important thing is that now Mamata has given up her earlier enmity for the Congress and she also seems to agree to form an alliance at the national level with the Congress
 congress bhi apni taraf se bahut satark ho gai he or koshish kar rahi he ki vah mamata ko lekar, khaskar bengal main, hamalavar na ho
 The party believes that the split of votes in TMC, Congress and Left parties will benefit the BJP immensely as the state has the largest number of Muslims and the saffron party can polarize votes during elections by cashing in on communal sentiments
 makapa ke netaa seetaram yechuri or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bich sambandh bahut achche hai isliye pashchim bengal main teenon dalon ko ek saath laakar ek asambhav gathbandhan ko sambhav karne kii koshishen chal rahi hai
 After all, the Congress and the JD (S), who were staunch opponents of each other in Karnataka, have joined hands to form the government
 aisa lagata he ki yah puraane dushmano ke gale milane kaa daur he
 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar announced that he has tied up with the Congress for both Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra
 vipakshi ekta ke achche sanket mil rahe hai lekin jaise-jaise loksabhaa chunaavon kaa samay najadik aayega, unamem siton ke bantwaare or satta kii saajheedaari ko lekar vivaad bhi honge
 The arithmetic of coming together with the opposition looks very good but keeping the chemistry between the leaders fine will be a difficult task (see Graphics, Mamta Formula of Delhi Fatah)
 in dalon main vaicharik matbhedon ke alaava inke kaadaron ko ek saath kaam karne ko raji kar lenaa bhi badi chunauti hogi
 The opposition has so far not been able to create a coherent and alternative bureaucracy with which it can lure voters in its favor by presenting a tough challenge to Modi and BJP
 bhaajapa ne vikaas ko mudda banaakar apana chunavi abhiyaan shuru bhi kar diya he jabaki vipakshi dal aapas main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar hi uljhe hue hai
 In 1977 and 1989, there were major issues like Emergency and Bofors brokerage that led the opposition parties to forget the differences and unite to defeat the Congress
 2019 main vaisaa hi maahaul taiyaar karnaa mamata ke liye kathin chunauti hoga
 But the one who does not seem to be lacking in them is their confidence
 ve ek samay aparaajey makapa ko haraa sakati hai or phir bhaajapa ko bouna sabit kar sakati hai to unhen bharosa he ki ve bhaajapa-virdohi dalon kaa mahagathbandhan taiyaar karke centre main satta tak bhi pahunch sakati hai
 Do not forget that whoever has mocked Mamta, she has had to repent much later

 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Vai

 Jaganmohan Reddy has decreed that 75 percent of the state's jobs should be reserved for the local people
 rajya vidhansabha ne 24 july ko andhra pradesh ke udyogon or factoriyon main sthaneey ummidavaaron ke liye rojgaar vidheyak, 2019 paarit kar diya
 The bill will be compulsorily applicable to all public-private industries, factories, joint ventures and projects of the state
 rajya ke ek afasar ne bataaya ki maujuuda companiyon ke paas is faisle ko lagu karne ke liye teen saal kaa vakt he; jabaki factory kanoon kii pehali anusuchee main darj companiyon—urvarak, koyala, pharmaceutical, petroleum or cement sareekhe jokhim vaale udyogon sahit—ko chhot milane kii sambhaavna he
 With this decision, the Chief Minister has fulfilled his promise made before the election
 unhone yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke maukey badhaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But the new law has created controversy among industry leaders
 unka aarope he ki isse vruddhi kii sambhaavnaaon ko jhatka lagegaa
 They say that this populist decision will dampen the enthusiasm of investors, who are already taking precaution to start a venture in a cash-strapped state
 ve daleel dete hai ki koi bhi udhyam honhaar yuvaaon ke bagaiyr fal-phool nahin saktaa or udyogon main sthaneey logon kii bharmaar khudakushi karne ke baraabar hogi
 Though Jagan has dismissed these criticisms as false propaganda but those who welcomed the decision are worried

 maharashtra, gujarat or karnataka main bhi aise kanoon kii maang pehle hi uthne lagi he
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath said on July 9 that he would bring a law to reserve 70 percent of jobs for the local people
 aise kanoonon se sthaneey logon kii bhartee ko badhaava to miltaa he, par rajya sarkaron ko sthaneey yuvaaon ko rojgaar ke laayak banane ke liye hunarmand banane par jor dena hoga
 Jagan says that they are working on it
 rajya sarkaar kaushal vikaas main nivesh karegi or naujavaanon ko jaruri hunar yaa kaushal kaa prashikshan dene ke liye udyogon ke saath milakar kaam karegi
 For this purpose, skill development centers will be opened in an engineering college in every parliamentary constituency, which will provide training and training for the necessary skills

 This move of jobs for the local people came at a time when Jagan's decision to review the contracts sanctioned under the previous TDP government has added to the uncertainty

 bihar vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne mangalvaar ko saafe-saafe kaha ki agency dwaara bulaaye jane par na jane kaa ye arth nahin lagaana chahie ki vijay maalya yaa lalit modi kii tarah wo desh chhodkar bhaag jaaenge
 In a communist conference in Patna, Tejashwi said, 'I went to the calling agency most often where i was questioned for nine hours and answered 80-80 questions but the method that is being adopted with us Why not being with others
 ' Tejashwi's clear reference was to Jai Shah, son of BJP President Amit Shah
 tejasvi ne kaha ki jai shah ko koi bhi agency koi notice kyon nahin detii yaa chhapemari yaa poochtacha ke liye kyon nahin bulaati he
 Tejashwi said that 'I have cooperated with the law and i am not among those who run away
 tejasvi ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se poocha ki mere maamle kii tarah kya aapane jai shah maamle main bhi phone kar saarvajanik rup se safai dene ke liye kaha yaa istipha dene ke liye kaha? unhone kaha ki sabake liye kanoon ek ho
 In this country, a law for Amit Shah, Nitish Kumar and a law for Tejashwi Yadav and Lalu Yadav will not work
 ' unhone nitish kumaar or amit shah ko salaah di ki agar jai shah ne kuch galat nahin kiya to unase im main lacture dilvaaya jaae
 The comments apane dilli pravaas ke baad patna laute tejasvi ke sanvadata sammelan main aatmavishvaas kii koi kami nahin dikhi
 He declared that he is now ready to respond to these leaders in the same manner in which the image of him and his party has been tried to tarnish the image of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi and Lallan Singh

 We will fight

 The countdown of Nitish Sarkar has started
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki hamalogon ne na kabhi galat kiya na karenge

 All the great men in this country have gone to jail and have been maligned
 tejasvi ke tevar se spasht he ki aane vaale dinon main unhen ummid he ki nitish kumaar ke liye mushkilen badhegi
 Tejashwi openly said that his doors are open to anyone who agrees with his ideology
 tejasvi kaa saafe ishaara bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bete jai shah kii ore tha
 Tejashwi asked why no agency gives any notice to Jai Shah or calls for raids or inquiries
 tejasvi kaha ki 'maine kanoon ke saath sahyog kiya he or main bhaagane vaale logon main se nahin hum
 Tejashwi asked the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that like in my case did you call in the Jai Shah case also to give public clarification or asked to resign? He said that there should be one law for everyone
 is desh main amit shah, nitish kumaar liye ek kanoon or tejasvi yadav or lalu yadav ke liye ek kanoon nahin chalane vaala
 'he advised Nitish Kumar and Amit Shah that if Jai Shah did not do anything wrong, he should be given a lecture at IIM

 Tejashwi Yadav said that we will never do wrong
 tejasvi ne saaf kiya ki filhal wo jail jane vaale nahin hai
 And going to jail is not wrong
 is desh main sabhi mahapurush jail gaye or badnaam kiye gaye hai
 It is clear from Tejashwi's attitude that in the coming days he hopes that the problems will grow for Nitish Kumar

 dilli police ne charchit maanasarowar park hatyakand kaa pardaafash kar diya he
 Police has arrested five people in this regard
 jinamein jindal parivaar ke saath maare gaye guard kaa damaad or betaa bhi shaamil he
 According to the police, the son-in-law and son of the guard had conspired for this sensational incident
 dilli police kii krime branch nemansarovar park hatyakandako sulajhaa liya he
 5 people have been arrested in this case
 hairaan kar dene vaali baat ye he ki jindal parivaar kii 4 mahilaon or ghar ke suraksha guard rakesh kii hatya ko anjaam dene vaale log khud mritak guard rakesh ke parivaar vaale hi bataae ja rahe he
 According to Alok Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Crime Branch, the deceased guard Rakesh along with his family had made a plan to loot the house of Jindal family
 mritak guard rakesh jab rakshabandhan ke dauraan apane ghar bagpat gaya tha, tabhi mritak guard rakesh ne apane bete anuj or damaad vikaas ko jindal parivaar main baari cash or jewelri hone kii baat bataai thi
 Since then Rakesh along with his son Anuj and son-in-law Vikas had planned to rob the Jindal family
 krime branch ke mutabik guard ke bete anuj or damaad vikaas ne apane 5 anya saathiyon ke saath mil kar beeti 6 akatubar ko jindal oil mil main lut kaa plan banaaya tha
 Anuj and Vikas along with their colleagues gathered in the Loni area the same night, then from there 7 people arrived in Jindal Oil Mill in two different autos
 saaton logon ko guard rakesh ne hi ghar ke andar daakhil karavaaya
 Then the deceased guard Rakesh gave voice to a woman of the family
 jaise hi parivaar kii ek mahila kamare kaa darwaja khol kar baahar ai, tabhi vikaas or anuj mahila ko kamare ke andar le gaye or parivaar kii 4 mahilaon kii hatya kar di
 After committing the murder of the four women, Vikas and Anuj, along with their 5 other associates, broke the room's wardrobe and escaped with millions of cash and jewelry
 ab aap ye soch rahe honge ki jab is puri ghatana kii sajeesh mritak guard rakesh ne rachi to guard rakesh kii hatya kyon kii gai
 The deceased guard Rakesh's son Anuj and son-in-law Vikas feared that guard Rakesh would open his mouth in front of the police when the Jindal family's women were killed
 is baat se pareshaan hokar bete anuj or damaad vikaas ne hi guard rakesh kii bhi hatya kar di
 After killing the 4 women and guards of the Jindal family, the seven people reached a park near GTB Hospital where they all shared the money and jewelery
 kisi ko in par shaq na ho isliye ye sabhi log subah apane apane kaam par chale gaye
 Joint Commissioner Alok Kumar said that Delhi Crime Branch has arrested 5 out of 7
 jisamen mritak guard kaa betaa anuj, damaad vikaas, anuj kii buaa kaa ladkaa sani, viki or niraj shaamil hai
 The other two accused Nitin and Deepak are being searched
 america main ek trek saal bhar main 3 lakh kilometre kaa safar tay karata he
 In contrast, a truck in India can travel only 50 to 60 thousand kilometers
 jiesti lagu hone se pehle desh ke transport sector ke liye yahi sabase badi pareshaani kaa sabab tha
 The reason is that no one knew how many truckloads of factory-laden trucks would stop at India from one state to another and from one city to another
 jiesti se yah badal jayega
 In any corner of the country, when the truck loaded with goods from the factory reached the other corner without interruption, then the benefit of GST will be given to each of the goods on the truck - cutting the cost of transporting the goods from the factory to the market
 ise bhi padhein: GST: sirf 35 fisadi karadaataaon ne kiya jiesti migrationis ummid par mana ja rahaa he ki desh main 1 july se jiesti lagu hone kaa ek bada phayda transport sector par padane ja rahaa he
 Good news from GST for this sector clearly means that it will directly benefit the businessmen across the country
 unka munafa bad jayega
 According to Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, the benefit of GST to the transport sector can be gauged from the one thing that now the tax department does not need the inter state check post
 kyonki maal le laden trek par rajyon ke darjanon cells tex ab jiesti main samahit ho chukaa he
 Therefore, the goods will be wired in a factory, at the same time the GST paper of its journey will be ready at the time of loading the truck, which will not need to be checked or updated during the journey
 ise bhi padhein: GST:GST council kuch chizon par badal sakati he GST dar, agast baithak main hoga faislajisti lagu hone ke baad aisa hone se desh main maal se laden trek ke travel time main badi katautee dekhne ko milegi
 At the same time, online registration of goods worth more than Rs 50,000 under the proposed e-bill system under GST will reduce the time taken by trucks at present
 vahiin transport sector main in badlaavon ke saath deshbhar sudharti hive sthiti se desh main bade container trek kii maang bhi badhegi jisase kam se kam samay main zyada se zyada utpaada bazaar tak pahunch sakegaa
 Another major benefit of single GST across the country in place of multiple phase VAT will be in logistics that companies will no longer need to have specialized warehouses in different states
 pehle alag-alag rajyon main tex dar alag rahane ke kaaran companiyon ko vishesh warehouse har rajya main bananaa padataa tha
 Now after the implementation of GST, there will be no such obligation on companies
 gauratlab he ki bharat main manuphaccharing kshetra main jiesti se pehle logistic cost 14 fisadi thi
 Whereas in the important countries of the world, this cost is just 6-8%
 kendra sarkaar ko ummid he ki jiesti ke chalate ab bharat main bhi logistic cost ghatakar 10-12 fisadi ke daayre main aa jaaegi jisase na sirf companiyaan utpaada ko kam daam par bech sakengi balki apane munaafe ko bhi badha sakengi

 The girl got stuck laughing
 magar is indicater ke pher main gaddi modane kaa khamiyaja bhi bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Because laughter can be caused by anything and fun is a negative word in itself
 film hansi to fansi hamen ye sabak dekar jaati he ki partner ke saath pyaar ko jab faisle kii taraazoo par rakhen, to shaareerik aakarshan or samajhadaari ke bedab tarkon ke bajaay dimagi harkaton ke milane ko zyada vajan den
 'hansi Toh Fansi' is an amazing film
 isamen vah sab kuch he, jisaki chaah liye ham or aap theatre main jate hai
 Story with good smooth twists, tremendous acting, fountains of constant laughter, dialogues written in true Mucci accents and a real message
 yuvaaon ko to yah film dekhni hi chahie, saath main bade-bujurgon or bacchon ko bhi
 So that we can understand the most intricate screw of life
 pech jise pyaar or shaadi kehete hai
 Some of the sirenkhil of the film's story is from childhood
 uske papa ipies hai or bada bhai iees
 Means a family with civil servants
 magar nikhil ek gujarati bijness family kii actress ladki ke pher main paisa kamaane ke pher main pad jaataa he or event management company shuru kar detaa he
 This girl's name is Karishma and she keeps on bombing the threat of breakup by repeatedly knocking Nikhil
 karishma kii kai bahanon main se ek he mita, jo bilkul 'bady tip' he
 She knows that it is more important to show the mind all the light of knowledge than to look like girls
 uske apane jagat se nyaare niraale funda hai life ke
 She runs away from the house during her elder sister's wedding
 tabhi uski nikhil se ek choti si magar yaad gali main pataa de jane vaali mulaakaat hoti he
 Mita returns after seven years, when Nikhil is engaged to Karishma and the two families are engaged in marriage in Mumbai
 mita karishma ko pichley vaakye or uske chalate parivaar main hue hangaame kii vajah se ghar nahin le ja sakati he
 So Mita falls on Nikhil's feet
 magar mita lauti kyon
 Why does she talk in Chinese periodically, why she blinks
 goliyaan kyon khaati he or sabase badi baat, vah ghar se bhaagi hi kyon thi
 And what about Nikhil, who is confused about his career and Karishma is conditioned to get a big project before marrying him
 in sab sawaalon ke jawaab milte hai auki jindagi kii tamaam paraten ek ek kar namoodaar hoti hai
 Seeing this film, how i am acting, i am not a fan again
 mita kaa tom boy luk
 Then the girl looks and the character comes out after eating all these parallel pills
 sabamein unhone jindagi bhar di he apni acting se
 Blink of an eyelid, ask for a wet towel with a tongue out, or give Nikhil knowledge on love while sitting in the bus or the discomfort of meeting his family, he has lived every moment to the fullest
 siddharth malhotra handsam dikhte hai or acchhee baat ye he ki sirf hero nahin, actor bhi hai vah
 He has tried his best in the role of Nikhil's caring, some Confused and some who want to pass the tax
 ek acchhee baat ye he ki hansi to fansi kii kamaal kii acting vaali list main sirf yahi do naam nahin aate
 Whether Manoj Joshi in the role of Mita's father or Sharat Saxena in the role of Nikhil's father, everyone's timing is very good
 karishma ke role main adaa sharma bhi apane kirdaar ke kinaaron ko kaaphi had tak sahejane main kaamyaab rahi hai
 Apart from this, Nikhil's friends-relatives and Mita's family also register their best income in small roles
 kya-kya dhansu he film mendyrector vinith mathew ne film kii raftaar kahin bhi kam nahin hone di
 He is also admired because he does not let the specifics of the relationship get lost in speed
 film kii kahani ek dam fresh he
 In dialogues, Anurag captures Kashyap's bluntness
 siaidi jokes kaa sikvence ho yaa phir kanpur ydal hone kaa daawa karne vaale nikhil ke bhai kii mita ke ird gird harakatein
 Everything shines through the colors of the film
 amitabh bhattacharya or kumaar kii kalam se nikle or vishaal shekhar ke mujeec se saje gane kahin se bhi thunse gaye nahin lagate
 Nothing vulgar is done to make them laugh and finally the film is not given a film twist
 film 'hansi to fansi' jarur dekhni chahie
 These are entertainment

 under 23 toornament hone se kisi bhi desh ko duusari team banane main madad milegi

 pankaj choudhary sirf 4 maheene jaisalmer ke police adheekshak (espi) rahe
 On 2 August, he was sent to the post of Commandant of Police Training School, Kishangarh in Ajmer
 38 saal ke ipies afasar choudhary kaa naam 49 police adhikariyon ke niyamit tabadalon kii suchi main shaamil tha lekin sabhi ko pataa tha ki unka tabadalaa 30 july ko gaji fakir kii historishit phir se kholane kii sajaa ke taur par kiya gaya he
 Ghazi Fakir, 70, is a religious leader of Sindhi Muslims and is represented in India by this religious fraternity, named Pir Pagaro, in Pakistan's Sindh province
 uske liye ve yahaan chanda bhi jutate hai
 His family holds the title of Fakir

 They have been sending messages to vote in favor of a particular party or candidate
 unka betaa saleh mohammad pokaran se vidhayak he or bhai abdulla fakir jaisalmer kaa jila pramukh
 In his first reaction to the media after being removed from Jaisalmer, Chaudhary said that the said action "may be one of the reasons for my transfer
" '' 2009 batch ke anusuchit jati ke choudhary ne dilli se em
 a
 kiya he
 They are originally from Varanasi
 espi ke rup main jaisalmer main unki pehali niyukti thi
 The talented and honest young IAS, IPS officers in Rajasthan often get the first posting as Collector / SP of Jaisalmer
 ise registani ilaake or pakistan se lagi seemaa ke kaaran chunauti bharaa or najuk ilaaka mana jaataa he
 On Chaudhary's transfer, markets remained closed in many towns in Jaisalmer, with large-scale protests also taking place
 isse pataa chalata he ki pakistan ke saath rishte hone ke kaaran gaji fakir ke prati gaiyr sindhi musalamaanon main kitna avishvaas he
 By taking action against him, Chaudhary was following the government directive from the police headquarters
 13 june ko bheje nirdesh main kaha gaya tha ki ve sabhi historishit dobaaraa kholi jaaen jo galat dhang se band kar di gai thim
 During the investigation, Chaudhary noticed that the history sheet of Ghazi Fakir was closed by Additional Superintendent of Police Ganpat Lal in May 2011 without giving any reason
 laal ke paas jaisalmer ke espi kaa atirikt prabhaar tha or unhen historishit band karne kaa adhikaar bhi nahin tha
 It is worth mentioning that Chaudhary waged a fierce campaign against the liquor brokers (laps), liquor mafia and anti-national elements
 aise tatwon ko prashray de rahe kai janpratinidhiyon or netaaon kii choudhary ko gherne kii koshish kaamyaab na hui to unhen pad se hataane kii jodtod tej kar di gai
 On receiving this news, on 4 July last, the general public and tourism businessmen appealed for the Jaisalmer bandh to stop their transfer
 maamla thodaa thanda pad gaya
 But as soon as the history sheet of Ghazi Fakir opened, the vested selfish section made Chaudhary's transfer a matter of prestige
 dilli darbar tak bhagdaud hui
 Finally, on August 2, Chaudhary's name was added to the list of 49 IPS officers transferred
 choudhary ko vaise apane tabadale ko lekar koi shikaayat nahin he
 "see, this is the government's jurisdiction, how long it wants to keep an officer in which area
" lekin itnaa jarur he ki kisi bhi afasar ko paryaapt samay to milanaa hi chahie, jisase vah vahaan kii sthitiyaan dekh-samajhakar sarkaar ke kaamon ko amali jama pahana sake
 Similarly, Giriraj Singh Kushwaha was also known for his bullying as a collector of Jaisalmer
 ve bhi kabhi gaji fakir or saleh mohammad ke dabaav main nahin aae, unka bhi 8 maheene main yahaan se tabadalaa ho gaya
 Chaudhary says that the history sheet was opened for the first time in view of the suspicious activities of Ghazi Fakir during the 1965 india-pakistan war
 kuch maamle darj hue, kuch or maamalon main bhi uskaa naam aayaa
 He was arrested under MISA on charges of illegal activities in the Emergency
 1990 main jaisalmer ke espi sudhir pratap singh ne dekha ki historishit kii file gaayab he
 He reopened the file but was soon transferred

 unhen jaisalmer aane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 Sattar's name was blacklisted with repatriation
 is maamle main saleh kaa kahana he ki unke pita ke khilaaf is umr main historishit kholane ke peeche ek sajeesh najar aa rahi he
 In his words, "my father does not see well, nor do he listen
" rajasthan main jald chunaav hone hai
 In such a case, propaganda against them is totally wrong
 saleh mohammad par aarope he ki unhone 17 may ko consteble pappuram meena ko peeta tha
 Meena along with some policemen were caught with goons who were harassing the tourists
 peechha karne par gunde saleh mohammad ke petrol pump main chhip gaye
 On getting the order from above, the case was suppressed
 lekin choudhary ke tabadale par gussa jaahir karne ke liye aakhirkaar police ne 3 agast ko exiar darj kii
 The matter has now been referred to the Crime Investigation Branch, on whose order the closed histories were reviewed

 In his article in the Economic Times, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay says that i was very impressed with the lawyer, he touched my heart
 inamdaar ne pahachaanaa yuva narendra main 'netaa'modi yah bhi khulaasa karte hai ki shaayad yuva narendra main unhone ek netaa kii pahchaan kar lee thi
 They used to ask which sport i like
 baad main sthaneey prachaarak inamdaar modi ke gaanv main aksar aane lage
 Enamdar continued to talk to Modi and these early meetings laid the foundation for a long and strong relationship between the two
 modi bhi is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki unke jivan par vakil sahab kaa khaasaa prabhaav he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's relationship with his father was not very good
 aise main yuva narendra ko inamdaar main ek pita tulya vyakti mila, jisane na keval unhen raajnneeti main guide kiya balki jivan ke anya sangharshon main bhi madad kii
 Early in his life, Modi felt the need for Enamdar's advice
 chaahe vah apane parivaar ko tyaagane ke baad gujarat lautnaa ho yaa phir bade logon ke kehane par apni padhai dobaaraa shuru karnaa
 Modi did his further studies through correspondence from Delhi University
 jab tihaad jail pahunche narendra modiinamdaar ne kabhi is baat kaa intjaar nahin kiya ki narendra modi unke paas aaenge
 He provided opportunities to Modi so that he could expand his horizons
 vakil sahab ne modi ko sanghathan jwoin karne ko kaha, kyonki akelaa ladaaka bahut dur nahin ja paata
 Modi said, 'he used to constantly say that i should join some organization
 ' inamdaar ne 1971 main narendra modi ko dilli bheja, taaki ve bangladesh ko aaazaad karaane ke liye chal rahe andolan main hissaa le saken
 This was Modi's first political move, which led him to Tihar Jail
 apatkaal ke dauraan bhumigat rahakar kaam karte rahe modidilli uniwarsity main namakan karaane kaa matlab tha, niyamit antaraal par rajdhani aana-janaa or jab apatkaal laga, to vakil sahab ne modi ko bhumigat rahakar kaam karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Modi would distribute pamphlets at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Delhi
 baad main vakil sahab ne modi ko jorge fernadins ko surakshit jagah par pahunchane kaa kaam diya
 Both the leaders were living in disguise
 sikh or sanyasi kii veshbhusha main modi kii tasviir dekhi ja sakati he
 Modi's career started flying at the speed of rocket
 After the Emergency was removed, Enamdar pushed Modi's career once again
 modi ko ek baar phir dilli bheja gaya
 This time he had the responsibility of cooperating in documenting the Sangh's resistance during the Emergency
 lakshya hasil kar liya gaya or iske baad modi kaa kariyar rocket kii raftaar se udaan bharne laga
 In 1987, the Sangh sent Modi to the BJP, Narendra Modi was made the department campaigner of Vadodara
 baad main unhen sambhag prachaarak banaaya gaya
 Meanwhile, Modi's contact with Inamdar diminished, but he did not miss the opportunity to spend time with his mentor
 modi jab bhi ahmedabad jate inamdaar se milane ke liye samay nikaal lete
 In 1987, the Sangh sent Modi to the BJP, Enamdar passed away, but the role cannot be dismissed
 jab pehali baar pradhanmantri awaas pahunche PM modiagast, 2001 main narendra modi ne pehali baar pradhanmantri awaas main kadam rakhaa, mauka tha atal bihari vaajapeyi ke haathon lakshmana raav inamdaar par modi kii likhi kitaab kaa vimochan
 The name of the book was 'setubandh', in which the lawyer has been compared to the bridge built by Lord Rama to Lanka
 agar dekha jaae to modi ke jivan main vakil sahab kii bhoomika ek sethu kii tarah hi he, jo narendra modi ke nijee or raajnneetik jivan ko jodatii he
 The bjp's 25-year-old alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra may have broken up just before the elections, but the BJP managed to handle the setback
 ekala chalo ke siddhant ko amalijama pahanaate hue bijepi ne piem ko aage rakh haryana main bhi 'chalon chalem modi' ke saath naaraa diya
 Know here that in the last stages of the assembly elections, BJP did so that the party is confident of forming in both the states
 loksabhaa chunaavon main mili apaar safalataa ke baad piem modi kii pehali pariksha kii ghadi ai, to puri party ko laga ki modi kii lokapriyata ko bhunaane ke sivaa or koi chaara nahin
 After getting the Sangh's approval, the party came out with a T20 strategy
 modi ne maharashtra main 27 or haryana main 10 reliyaan kin
 Party president Amit Shah did not lag behind him after performing 20-20 rallies in Maharashtra and Haryana
 iske saath hi grahamantri rajnath singh ne maharashtra main 12 reliyaan kin, to sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne 104 sabhaayen kin
 In all, the BJP held 715 meetings in Maharashtra
 sthaneey logon ko niraashaa haath naa lage iske liye modi hon yaa phir koi or varisht netaa, har sabha main manch par sthaneey netaaon ko hi rakhaa gaya
 Party leaders and activists from across the country were fired in both states
 sangh or bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke saath saath party ke mahasachivon or tamaam kendriya mantriyon ko bhi prachaar or sanghathan ko durust karne or nigaraanee karne ke kaam main lagaaya gaya tha
 Along with the rallies, BJP also formed clusters of 8, 10 and 12 assembly seats in Maharashtra
 har cluster kaa jimmaa ek varisht netaa ko saunpa gaya
 50 such clusters were formed in Maharashtra and 10 in Haryana
 bijepi ne ye sunishchit kiya ki har vidhansabha seat par ek varisht kendriya netaa yaa phir modi sarkaar kaa koi mantri maujuud rahe
 During the election campaign, a three-tier monitoring mechanism was working in every assembly seat
 ek sthaneey netaa ke saath saath ek kendriya netaa bhi laga tha
 So that there is no possibility of disturbances in the surveillance
 bijepi ne prachaar ke liye bane digital rathon main jeepies bhi lagavaaya taaki iskaa durupyog naa ho
 There were 86 such chariots in Maharashtra, who campaigned for BJP in more than 10 places in one day and visited around 8000 places in the state
 party ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki ummidavaaron kii gaadi main jeepies lagaae gaye the
 If sources are to be believed, BJP Maharashtra leaders have long been talking of breaking ties with Shiv Sena
 isliye jab raste alag hue tab har ilaake main kaaryakarta taiyaar the
 That is, with the Sangh and with the help of Modi, the party is feeling that now the two states will be crossed
 malaika aroda or arjuna kapur kaa relation kisi se chipa nahin he
 The hangout and vacation photos of both had already pointed to their relationship, later Malaika also officially turned their relationship on insta
 lekin shaayad kuch aise bhi log hai jinhen unke rishte se aapatti he
 Malaika Arora has now given this answer while not giving negative comments to such people

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal has been welcomed by former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah
 haalanki, unhone kai sawaal bhi uthaae he
 Omar Abdullah said that please give us your democratic right to choose our government, especially for not holding assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir
 umr abdulla ne likhaa, priy narendra modi sahib, aapako namchin hastiyon se matadaataaon ko jaagruk karne kii apil karte hue dekhnaa acha lagata he, lekin duusari taraf aapaki sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir main samay par vidhansabha chunaav na karakar jaanboojhkar yahaan ke logon ko isse bedakhal kar diya he
 Dear @ narendramodisahib, it is good to see you appealing to famous people to increase voter turnout however at the same time your government has consciously disenfranchised people in J&K by not holding Assembly elections on time
 — Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)march 13, 2019unhone likhaa, sarkaar ko chunane kaa adhikaar logon ko dena chahie, aap jis tarah ke loktantr ke bare main twit kar rahe hai, uski yah pahchaan haiy kripaya hamen apni sarkaar chunane ke liye apana loktantric adhikaar den
 The right to choose an elected government, as opposed to being governed by a hand picked nominee of the central government, is the hallmark of the sort of democracy you are tweeting about
 Please give us our democratic right to choose our own government
 - Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) March 13, 2019 Let us know, PM Modi appealed to the voters of different fields, politics, industry, sports and film industry for voter awareness
 unhone rahul gandhi, mamata banerjee, sharad pavaar, mayawati, akhilesh yadav, tejasvi yadav, emke stallin, naveen patnayak, echdi kumaraswami, chandrababu naidu, jagan mohan reddy, nitish kumaar, ram vilaas paswan, pawan chamling, harsimrat cor badal, chiraag paswan, aditya thakare ko tag kiya
 i call upon KCR Garu, @ naveen_odisha, @ hd_kumaraswamy, @ ncbnand @ ysjaganto work towards bringing maximum Indians to the polling booths in the upcoming elections
 May voter awareness efforts be strengthened across the length and breadth of India
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 13, 2019 However, PM Modi neither tagged Omar Abdullah nor his father Farooq Abdullah
 iske alaava pidipi netaa mahabuuba mufti ko bhi tag nahin kiya gaya he
 Shahrukh Khan's film Raees is directed by Rahul Dholakia
 film main shahrukh rais alam kii bhoomika main hai
 Apart from him, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Mahira Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Zishan and Narendra Jha are seen in important roles
 film kii kahani gujarat ke fatehpur se shuru hoti he jahaan rais kaa bachapan apni maa ke saath garibi main guzar rahaa he, garibi ke chalate rais bachapan main hi sharaab taskari ke dhandhe main ghus jaataa he
 In the film, the clash between groups for liquor starts, the politics of political parties, the conspiracy of conspiracy and the game of thief-police, so this was the essence of the story
 khaamiyon kii baat karen to 'rais' kii kahani behad saadhaaran he jisamen koi alag pahalu najar nahin aata
 Secondly, Rais's childhood scenes do not instill sympathy in your mind but increase the length of the film
 mahira ke saath shahrukh ke drishy bhi fike lagate hai kyonki na to ye koi bhaavana ko janm dete hai or na hi inkaa film kii script main koi yogadan he or mahira kaa abhinay bhi mujhe halkaa hi laga
 Now some features
 'rais' kii pehali or sabase badi khubi hai shahrukh khan jinke vyaktitv kaa karishma is film ko damdaar banataa he
 In any scene of the film, Shah Rukh has not made the slightest mistake of moving from his character
 apni chaal-dhaal,dialog delivery or haav-bhav se vah film kii khaamiyon kii taraf aapkaa zyada dhyaan jane nahin dete
 The film may prove to be a treat for Shah Rukh's fans
 tippaniyan The other strong pillar of the film is Nawazuddin Siddiqui who, with his flowing acting, is holding the other end of the film and along with him Jishan and Narendra Jha make the rest of the film easier
 'rais' ke dialog aapako tali or sitiyaan bajaane par majaboor kar denge
 The script is tight and the background score makes the film more interesting, the filming of the scenes is impressive for which both the director and the cinematographer deserve praise
 sangeet kii baat karen to 'udi udi jaae', 'jaalimaa', 'laila main laila' jaise gane pehle hi hit ho chuke hai
 Another thing is that the film is influenced by the 70s and 80s Sinma and its treatment is also done in the same way as the story takes place in the 80s
 yah film aapako larger dain life cinema or unke nayakon kii ek baar phir yaad dilaaegi jahaan bahut sa manoranjan, ek dabang hero or behtareen gane dekhne ko milte the
 In the same way there is entertainment in Shah Rukh Khan's film, but with a glimpse of reality, everything will not be seen over the top or artificial here
 to jaaie film dekhie, meri taraf se is film ko 3 stars
 Talking of flaws, the story of 'raees' is very simple in which no different aspect is seen
 duusari baat yah rais ke bachapan ke drishy aapke man main uske liye hamadardi paidaa nahin karte balki film kii lambaai badhaate hai
 Shahrukh's scenes with Mahira also seem to fade because neither they evoke any emotion nor do they contribute to the script of the film and i find the performance of Mahira mild
 ab kuch khubiyaan
 The first and biggest feature of Raees is Shah Rukh Khan whose personality charisma makes this film strong
 film ke kisi bhi drishy main shahrukh ne apane kirdaar se hilne kii jaraa si bhi galati nahin kii he
 He does not pay much attention to the flaws of the film due to his movement, dialogue delivery and gesture
 shahrukh ke prashansakon ke liye yah film ek treet sabit ho sakati he
 The comments film ke duusare majboot stambh hai navazuddin siddiki jo apane behate abhinay se film kaa doosraa sira sanbhale hue hai or inke saath jishaan or narendra jha film ke baaki safar ko aasaan banaate hai
 The dialogue of 'raees' will make you clap and whistle
 script kasi hui he or becoground score film ko or rochak banataa he, drishyon kaa filmakan prabhaavshaalee he jiske liye nirdeshak or cinemetographer donon hi tarif ke paatr hai
 Talking about music, songs like 'uri Uri Jaaye', 'jalima', 'laila Main Laila' have already been a hit
 ek or baat yah ki film 70 or 80 ke dashak ke sinamaa se prabhavit he or iskaa treetment bhi usee tarah kiya gaya he kyonki yah kahani 80 ke dashak main ghatati he
 The film will once again remind you of Larger Than Life cinema and their heroes where a lot of entertainment, a domineering hero and great songs were seen
 thik usee tarah shahrukh khan kii film main manoranjan he par vaastaviktaa kii jhalak ke saath yani har cheez yahaan over di top yaa banaavati najar nahin aegi
 So go see the film, this film from my 3 stars

 The Election Commission has also supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi's thinking of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together
 haalanki, chunaav ayog ne bataaya he ki iske liye samvidhan main kam se kam paanch sanshodhan karne honge
 These include the tenure of Lok Sabha and legislatures and provisions relating to dissolution of them
 chunaav ayog ne kanoon mantralay ko bheje ek note main bataaya he ki ek saath chunaav karaane ke maamle main kya sanvaidhanik chunautiyaan aa sakati hai
 Confirming the receipt of the note, sources in the legal department of the Law Ministry said that apart from this, the commission also suggested that the vote of confidence would be more rational than the no confidence vote
 gauratlab he ki bijepi desh main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ek saath karaane kii vakaalat kar rahi he
 President Ramnath Kovind and PM Modi have spoken about it themselves
 chunaav ayog ne is tarah kii pahal kaa samarthan to kiya he, lekin uski taraf se jo salaah di gai he uske mutabik yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 According to the Law Ministry report, many amendments will have to be made to the constitution for this
 sansad ke kaarykaal se jude samvidhan ke anuchhed 83 main sanshodhan karnaa hoga
 Article 85 of the rules relating to dissolution of Lok Sabha by the President will also have to be amended
 inke alaava rajyon kii vidhansabha ke kaarykaal or vidhansabhaon ko bhang karne se jude anuchhed 172 or 174 main bhi badlaav karnaa hoga
 Similarly, Article 356 related to the dismissal of the state government will also have to be changed
 sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko manaanaa hogyhi nahin, iske liye sabhi rajyon or raajnneetik dalon se vyapak sahmati kii jarurat bhi hogi
 According to the Law Ministry report, 'to maintain respect for the federal structure of our governance, it is necessary that the consent of all state governments is obtained
 ' gauratlab he in badlaavon ke liye sansad ke donon sadanon main do-tihaai bahumat kii jarurat he, isliye sarkaar ke liye sabhi raajnneetik dalon kii sahmati leni jaruri he
 The Election Commission's expenditure of Rs 2,000 crore will not increase, for such a change in the electoral calendar, the Election Commission will need to purchase additional evms / vvpats, which will cost at least Rs 2,000 crores
 ayog ne atirikt iviem or vvpat ke nirmaan ke liye 2000 karod rupee ke bajet kii manzuri kii baat bhi kahi he
 Earlier this amount was 1500 crores
 sarkaar ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki is kaary main dhan kii kami nahin hone di jaaegi
 By the way, the Commission has already said that if the Government makes constitutional changes, then the Commission has no problem in holding the elections of all the Legislative Assemblies together with the Lok Sabha in the whole country

 a gas leak occurred late Wednesday night at the TDI plant of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizer Company in Dowry, which has killed 4 workers and affected more than 10 workers, who are undergoing treatment in a private hospital
 jienefasi kaa ye sabase bada plant he or yaheen se uski 60 pratishat ke kareeb kamai aati he
 It was commissioned a few years ago
 2014 ke janvari main bhi yahaan par foszea gas kaa risaav hua tha lekin us vakt kisi ko nuksaan nahin hua tha
 But when the gas leak occurred on Wednesday night, it had a deep impact on the workers working in the company at that time
 foszea zahreeli gas he or iskaa risaav agar zyada ho jaay to aasapaas ke ilaakon ke liye bhi ye jaanaleva sabit ho saktaa he
 The comments iskaa prabhaav kitna khatarnaak hota he iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kareeb 17 mazaduron ko paas ke aspataal company ke hi ambulance main le jaaya gaya lekin 4 logon ke shwasan pranali main iskaa asar itnaa bad gaya tha ki unki maut ho gai
 Due to the problem of gas leakage in this area twice in two years, people are worried about the GNFC plant
 gujarat polution control board ne bhi apane adhikari bhejkar puri ghatana kii jaanch shuru karvaa di he
 The stock market also affected the stock of GNFC company due to such an incident and its stakes fell by more than 15 percent

 foszea zahreeli gas he or iskaa risaav agar zyada ho jaay to aasapaas ke ilaakon ke liye bhi ye jaanaleva sabit ho saktaa he

 aise main is jila sanghathan ke sahare congress ke siyaasi bhavishya kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This is the reason why Priyanka Gandhi has now started the exercise to strengthen the Congress by getting out of it

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) President Mayawati on Monday targeted the Narendra Modi government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Center
 unhone kaha ki jai bhim vaale is baar namo namo karne waalon kii jamaanat jabt kara denge
 Addressing a public meeting in favor of coalition candidate Haji Yakub Qureshi here, Mayawati said, "no matter how much the BJP people do Namo Namo, Jai Bhima will forfeit his bail
" " basapa mukhiya ne kaha, "desh main dalit, alpsankhyakon kaa utpeedan badha he
 Especially in states where BJP governments are there, oppression is more
 garib savarno kaa 10 fisadi aarakshan se utthan hone vaala nahin he
 "mayawati surrounded the Modi government on the issue of demonetisation and GST," both of which were implemented without preparation, leading to further increase in poverty, unemployment in the country
 chote va madhyam vargeey vyapaaree dukhi hai
 The country's economy has also been affected
 desh kii simaaen surakshit nahin hai, aae din aatanki ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai
 "the BSP supremo said," Like the Congress, the BJP has tried to weaken the leaders of the opposition parties by using the CBI for its political selfishness, which is continuing

 People of the country have tried them many times, now there is no need to try much
 "unhone kaha, "bhaajapa ne 2014 ke chunavi vaade puure nahin kiye

 sarkaar ne sadako kii vacum clining kii baat kahi he lekin in sari kavayad ke liye sarkaar ne 2 hafte kaa samay maanga he
 The question is that even in this terrible situation of pollution, the government needs time to resolve
 agar visheshgyon kii maane to pradooshan ke is charan par ye sari kavayad kargar sabit nahin ho sakati
 Pollution levels measured in different areas are much higher than normal

 At the same time, 2 call centers are owned and some have worked in insurance company before and some are people with the help of which bank accounts were opened in which this gang used to deposit money
 insurance company main kaam kar chuke log kaal centre ke maalik ko jaankaree dete the
 After this, the person calling from the call center, luring more profits, used to ask the victims to put money in the bank account, and as soon as the money comes into the account, then the person in whose name the account has been opened withdraws money with the help of ATM or self check
 The tax was kept by 20% himself and the rest 80% was given to the owner of the call center

 In the agenda 'aaj Tak', Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was told that nowadays, Rahul Gandhi attacks you a lot
 unke nishane par sidhe vitt mantri hote hai
 When Rahul said Gabbar Singh tax, did you touch him? On this question, Jaitley said in a sneaky manner that he lacked information

 Jaitley was asked whether Rahul is backing down? Nowadays every speech of his is cheering

 Rebellion has started against Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference working president Omar Abdullah
 umr ke khilaaf baghawat kii shuruyaat karne vaala or koi nahin balki unka apana hi jigari dost,purv media adwaijar or rajya sabha sadsy, gulam nabi ratanpuri he
 Political analysts believe that Ghulam Nabi Ratanpuri, a Rajya Sabha member of the National Conference, is attacking Omar Abdullah in a thoughtful move
 jammu-kashmir main 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle ratanpuri, neshnal conference ke netaa, umr abdulla ke media adwaijar the or vah radio kashmir, srinagar main senior produsar the
 Omar had his resignation from Ratanpuri and contested from Pulwama assembly constituency as a party candidate and lost
 lekin phir bhi umr ne dosti ko nibhaayaa or party adhyaksh or apane pita farrukh abdulla kii marji ke khilaaf ratanpuri ko rajya sabha sadsy banwaaya
 For the first time since Farooq Abdullah's brother-in-law, Ghulam Mohammad Shah alias Gool Shah in 1984, the leader of the National Conference is openly criticizing Omar
 ratanpuri kaa aarope he ki abdulla sarkaar said ali shah gilaani or anya hurriyat conference ke netaaon ko gharon or jelon main band kar rahi he
 Ratanpuri has met Gilani and other Kashmiri separatist leaders several times
 itnaa hi nahin kuch din pehle ratanpuri ne fasebuk par likhaa tha ki jab bhi umr ko kisi kendriya mantri kaa phone aata he to vah fouran apane udan khatole ( sarkari jahaaj) se dilli pahunch jate he
 Following Ratanpuri's frequent statements, Umar Abdullah in a speech a few days ago suggested to him that he should immediately resign from the Rajya Sabha seat as Ratanpuri had got around 200 votes in the assembly elections on his own
 umr ne yahaan tak kaha ki agar ratanpuri ko ek ratti bhi atmasamman he to unhen pehle sansad se tyaagptr dena chahie or phir free hokar neshnal conference ke khilaaf byanbaji kerani chahie
 But Ghulam Nabi Ratanpuri says that he is raising voice as the representative of the people
 log meri baat tabhi sun rahe he kyoki main neshnal conference kaa saansad hoon or jab main sadsyta se hi tyaagptr de duungaa to meri baat koun sunegaa
 Ratanpuri says that at present he has no intention of resigning from the post of MP
 he
 Ratanpuri says that he will only expose Omar Abdullah while staying in the party, for which he is preparing a draft
 fasebuk par apane taaja post main gulam nabi ratanpuri ne kaha he ki abhi to shuruyaat hi hui he aage-aage dekho hota he kya? The counting of votes will take place on November 19

 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ne pehali baar dilli ke purna rajya hone ke phaayde ginaae hai
 Interestingly, before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal in his speech has made almost the same promise that the BJP had made before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 purna rajya ke darje par aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne daawa karte hue kaha he ki agar centre sarkaar dilli sarkaar ko 1 saal ke liye 40 hajaar karod rupye detii he, to unki sarkaar 5 saal ke andar dilli ke ek-ek aadmi ko ghar de degi
 Explain that before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had announced that if black money outside India comes to India, then every man's bank account will get 15 lakh rupees
 haalanki bijepi ne satta main aane ke baad ise ek jumala qaraar diya tha
 At present, Kejriwal is also seen announcing on the same lines
 kejarivalane aage kaha ki puure desh me sabase zyada tex dilli vaale dete hai
 1 lakh 30 thousand crores tax is collected by the Central Government from Delhi
 badale main centre sarkaar kuch nahin detii
 The British did not suck the people of this country so much
 angrej bharat kaa sona or paisa lootakar england le jate the
 But today the British have not sucked as much as the central government is sucking Delhi
 kejariwal ke mutabik desh ke kai hisson main garibi he, dilli se 1 lakh 30 hajaar karod tex lekar duusare rajyon ko diya jaataa he
 Kejriwal says that the Aam Aadmi Party government is not begging, asking for the earning of its blood and sweat
 is tex kaa 30% kareeb 39 hajaar karod rupye dilli ko diya jaae
 Every man dreams of getting a job and a house of his own
 har parivaar ko ghar or har aadmi ko naukari mil sakati he agar dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja mil jaae
 Highlights of Kejriwal's speech- The people of this country fought the freedom, the country became independent in 1947
 desh aaazaad hone kaa matlab kya hua? desh me janatantr aa gaya, 26 janvari 1950 ko samvidhan lagu ho gaya
 Democracy means that the people will vote, the vote will elect the government, the elected government will work according to the people and if the government does not work for 5 years, the people will uproot it
 - 1947 ke baad puure desh me azaadi aa gai
 It was decided that the Viceroy would not do because the rule of the people came, but Delhi was betrayed by sitting the LG in place of the Viceroy
 1992 main bolaa gaya ki samvidhan main sanshodhan karenge or dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja denge, lekin wo samvidhan bhi dhokhaa niklaa
 - The British Government of India Act was brought in 1935
 angrejon ne tab kaha tha ki ham aapke desh ko azaadi de rahe hai, ab yahaan chunaav honge or aap apni sarkaar chunanaa lekin angrejon ke us kanoon main likhaa tha ki chalegi valsaroy kii
 Then Gandhiji, Chacha Nehru, said that this freedom is not a hoax and gave the slogan 'british leave India'
 - thik aisa hi samvidhan dilli ke liye 1992 main laayaa gaya
 Where the government will elect the public but will run for LG

 ek aise desh ke liye, jahaan sadaken jam padi rahati hai or jin par aakraamak andaaj main lekin behad dhimi gati se gadibhan chalati hai, hybrid vaahan hi sabase adarsh hai
 Such cars are quite fuel-efficient in countries like India and China, where usually all cars run on clutch-brake-clutch pressures

 In a sudden change, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is facing the first rebellion of his tenure
 teen baar saansad rah chuke or ab vidhayak karnal sonaaram choudhary ne gahalot ko ek aisa ahamkaari insaan qaraar diya he, jise congress alaakaman ko chunauti dene kaa bhi dar nahin he
 On March 31, 14 mlas led by Chaudhary met Ahmed Patel in Delhi, later returning to Rajasthan, but most of the mlas met Rahul Gandhi on 3 April
 donon hi mulakaaton main unki shikaayat yah thi ki gahalot unki or baaki pratinidhiyon kii baat nahin sunate
 He had informed the high command about how Gehlot is promoting corruption by using bureaucracy
 rahul ne asantushton se kaha he ki ve sonia gandhi se milakar apni baat bataa den
 Due to the high command's disgruntlement, the dissident remained silent for a long time and Gehlot also expressed that there was nothing to worry about as he had sent these mlas to the high command
 9 april ko dilli main sonia ke saath mulaakaat ke baad bhi gahalot ne jab yahi baat phir doharaai, to choudhary kav sabar kaa baandh tut gaya
 He spoke to reporters in Jaipur on 10 April and denied that Gehlot had told him to meet the party high command
 choudhary ne spasht kiya ki farvari main congress vidhayak dal kii baithak main jab unakv jaise kuch vidhayakon ne sarkaar ko lachar dhang se chalaae jane kaa mudda uthaaya to bakaul choudhary, gahalot ne alaakaman main apni pahunch kii dhauns dikhaai
 In Chaudhary's words, "gehlot said that he has been Union Minister, State President, National General Secretary three times and has become Chief Minister for the second time
" '' farvari kii baithak main hi gahalot asantushton ko lalakaara chuke hai
 Chaudhary and other disgruntled mlas say that Gehlot challenged us
 choudhary kehete hai, ''aisa lagata he, gahalot is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki ve mukhyamantri kav taur par apni manmarjee chalaate rahenge or alaakaman kii ore se jaraa bhi hastkshep nahin hoga
 The dissident camp claims that more than 30 mlas will soon meet Sonia Gandhi
 rajasthan main congress kii mushkil yah he ki philhal uske paas gahalot kaa koi majboot vikalp nahin he
 However, if the Congress decides to change the leadership in case of escalating controversy, then Chaudhary as Jat face and Bharat Singh as acceptable Rajput face are said to be alternatives
 inke alaava kendriya sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantri si

 joshi majboot daavedaar hai lekin unako kaman saunpe jane kii sthiti main bhilwara kii loksabhaa seat khaali kerani padegi or maujuuda raajnneetik halaat main upachunaav main seat barkaraar rakhana badi chunauti hogi
 The same is the case with Sachin Pilot and Bhanwar Jitendra Singh
 lekin virodhiyon kaa munh band karne ke liye netritv parivartan ke bajaae ek vikalp or he, jiskaa istemaal gahalot kar sakate hai
 Make disgruntled leaders, Chaudhary, Udaylal Anjana and some other mlas ministers
 rajya main virodh ko shant karne ke liye gahalot pehle bhi is pantare ko aajamaate rahe hai
 The realities of the dissidents will also be revealed by their bets
 isi formule par bharatpur cond ke baad mantrimandal punargathan hua tha
 In this, Shanti Dhariwal, close to Gehlot, resigned first and a new Council of Ministers was formed with collective resignation, after which the intentions of Dhariwal were revealed
 apana shahari vikaas vibhaag bachaae rakhane kaa gahalot ke saath hua dhariwal kaa sauda benakaab ho chukaa he
 Gehlot has been facing strong caste-based opposition since the arrest of some top leaders in various cases at the hands of the CBI
 rajya main bhrashtachar ke maamle charam par hai
 Therefore, sensing the seriousness of the situation, the high command should take cognizance and declare not to remove Gehlot or change the leadership till the upcoming assembly elections in the state

 haalanki yah lav seen ek dream sikvence ke rup main filmaae jane kii khabar he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'bajirao Mastani', which came in the year 2015, has also been accused of tampering with history and hurting feelings
 'bajirao mastaani' ke relies ke samay is film kaa pune main jamkar virodh hua tha
 In a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Peshwa's descendant Prasadrao Peshwa had demanded the government intervene in the matter, alleging, "it has been found that the original history in this film was reversed in the name of creative freedom
" is
 saath hi, ek geet ko shrimant bajirao peshwa pratham kii do patniyon kashibai or mastaani par filmaaya gaya he
 This incident does not match the historical facts

 At the same time, a lot of controversy started regarding the name of Bhansali's film 'ramlila'

 This film was also accused of tampering with history

 yah ghatana aitihaasik tathyon se mail nahin khaati
 He also said that the 'pinga' dance style is an integral part of Marathi culture and has been transformed into an item song in the film and the dress and dance direction of the song is consistent
 vahiin isse pehle bhansaali kii film 'ramlila' ke naam ko lekar bhi kaaphi vivaad shuru hua tha
 Ashutosh Gavorikar's film 'jodha Akbar' was also opposed by the same Rajput Karni Sena of Rajasthan
