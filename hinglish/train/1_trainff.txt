 maharashtra main ab kisaan parivaar kaa har vyakti karj maafee kii arji de saktaa he
 Cooperative Minister Subhash Deshmukh said on Friday that farmers were constantly requesting that a family has more than two account holders
 har ek ne kheti ke liye bank se karja liya hua he
 In such a situation, it is not right to allow only one person of a family for loan waiver
 bataa den ki chhatrapati shivaji maharaj shetakari sanmaan yojana ke tahat ab tak ek kisaan parivaar se sirf ek hi vyakti ko karj maafee ke liye arji bharne kii ijaajat thi
 Only one and a half lakh debt waivers were allowed by the state government, ie, both husband and wife together
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon dwaara sarkaar ko bataaya gaya ki donon ke karje kii rakam agar ek lakh sattar hajaar ho to dedh lakh ke upar kii rakam kisaan ko bharani pad rahi he
 Therefore, the matter came up for discussion before a sub-committee formed by the state government
 is maamle main upasmiti se sifarish karne ke baad mantri mandal ne is baat ko manjuuri di he ki kisaan parivaar kaa har ek vyakti karj maafee ke liye ab arji kar saktaa he
 Subhash Deshmukh told 'aaj Tak' that if the husband has taken a loan of 90 thousand and his wife 90 thousand from the bank, then both the debts will be able to take forgiveness
 kisaan karj maafee ke nae niyamon ke baad jin kisaanon ke parivaar main ek se zyada vyakti ne bank se karja liya he or unhone agar karj maafi kaa online form nahin bharaa to unhen dobaaraa form bharne kaa mauka milane vaala he
 Subhash Dekhmukh said that so far 89 lakh farmers had applied for loan waiver
 77 lakh kisaanon kii arji manjuur kar lee gai he
 Debt waiver of 57 lakh farmers has been done
 is nae niyam se atirikt paanch lakh kisaan parivaar ke vyakti ko karj maafee kaa phayda milegaa
 According to Subhash Dekhmukh, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has ordered that every farmer should get the benefit of loan waiver scheme
 chaahe thodi deree kyon na ho lekin sabhikisaanon koiskaa mauka milanaa chahie
 Therefore, those who have taken loans from 2001 to 2009 have also been given a chance

 After all, the party won all its seats in the state in the Lok Sabha elections
 dalit diggaj ke apane iklaute bete ko party kii kaman saunpane se shaayad hi koi chaunkaa ho
 But according to experts, this much is not enough
 pichley kuch dashak se ramvilas paswan hameshaa jite hue paksh main rahane kii gajab kii kaabiliyat dikhaate rahe hai
 For this reason, he has secured a place in the cabinet of six different Prime Ministers
 lekin ve khud bhi 2014 main apane rajnatik punerjeevan or uske baad hasil hui kamyaabiyon ke liye chiraag kii 'duuradrushti' ke mureed ho gaye hai
 Chirag, he says, explained to him to join NDA instead of UPA just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 tab bahut log lojpa ko khaarij karne lage the kyonki 2009 main vah ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai thi
 At the same time, the party could win only three seats in the 2010 Bihar assembly elections
 aise main chiraag kaa akalan sahi baitha or party 2014 main saat main se chah loksabhaa siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi or is saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon main to uske sabhi chah ummidavaar jeet gaye
 Chirag has also been given the responsibility of the state unit of the party at an important time as assembly elections are due in Bihar next year
 chiraag yah bhi dikhaa chuke hai ki ve kade faisle lene se ji nahin churaate
 Recently, when a handful of BJP leaders have raised the flag of rebellion against JD (U) chief and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the NDA ally in the state, LJP stands in favor of Nitish Kumar
 lojpa ne khulkar kaha he ki ''nitish kumaar hi bihar main endie kaa cheharaa hai or rahenge
 "chirag said," There is no alternative to Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 lojpa unhen rajya main endie kaa netaa maanati he
 This support of LJP is special in many respects
 chiraag ne ramvilas paswan ko rajyasabha main bhejne ke liye nitish kumaar ke samarthan kaa ehsaan bhi chukaaya he
 If we look at the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the combined vote share of JD (U) and LJP is quite good, 30 percent
 yah paryaapt vajah he ki bhaajapa is vyavastha ko gadabadana nahin chaahegi
 So, is Chirag fully ready to take over the reins of the party from his father? Chirag describes it as a relationship between the sun and the moon
 ve kehete hai, ''ve hameshaa meri urja or astitv kaa strot bane rahenge
 "LJP is planning a rally on its foundation day on 28 November, which will try to give some more strength to Chirag's coronation
" dashakon se ramvilas paswan apane majboot 6
 Dalits remain the face of Bihar with 5 percent vote bank
 rajya main daliton kii acchhee-khaasi aabaadi he
 However, even though Chirag is now officially in command, his political path is not so easy
 unke pita unke liye ek lambii viraasat chhod rahe hai, magar is yuva dalit netaa ko bhi logon kii ummiido par khara utarana hoga

 com / zfpu3fn3h4 Before the report of Lokayukta Santosh Hegde in the illegal mining case in Karnataka, the opposition JDS filed a case against some BJP leaders on Monday for allegedly trying to influence the Lokayukta to save Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa on the issue
 sought to
 haalanki hegade ne ab tak bellari ke khanan udhyami reddy bandhuon ko apni report main doshi tehraane yaa nahin tehraane ke sawaal par koi tippanee nahin kii he lekin is tarah kii atakalein hai ki report main avaidh khanan ko rokane ke maamle main bhaajapa sarkaar ko doshi tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Amid reports of senior BJP leaders contacting Hegde and asking him not to file Yeddyurappa's name in the report, JDS state president HD Kumaraswamy said the Lokayukta should be given to Minister VS Acharya, Special Representative of Delhi v Dhananjay Kumar and Finance a case should be registered against AJ Kudgi, former chairman of the commission and order his arrest
 kumaraswami ne is mudde par naitik aadhaar par yediurppa ke istife kii bhi maang kii or aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa or congress donon kaa sanvaidhanik taur par gathit sansthaaon main bharosa nahin he
 He said, Congress and BJP are scared of the Lokayukta's final report on illegal mining, which is expected to be submitted soon
 kumaraswami ne yah bhi kaha ki jedies mangalvaar ko yahaan ek raily karegi or rajyapal echaar bharadwaj ko gyaapan saunpkar lokayukta ko prabhavit karne kii koshish karne ke maamle main yediurppa sarkaar ko hataane kii maang karegi
 Hegde claimed that Dhananjay Kumar and Acharya had met him a few months ago and tried to influence him in the case of Yeddyurappa being accused in the report on illegal mining
 is bich varisht congressi netaa or karnataka vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa siddharamaiya ne aaj kaha ki kuch bhaajapa vidhayak yediurppa ke liye lamabandi kar rahe hai jo shame kii baat he
 He requested Lokayukta Santosh Hegde to take notice of the Chief Minister and issue a notice to the Chief Minister
 bihar main sattarudh mahagathbandhan main shaamil rashtriya janata dal, janata dal-united or congress ne is khulaase se mili jaankaree ke baad bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii aguwai vaali centre sarkaar or rajya main vipakshi dal bhaajapa par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Leaders of the grand alliance say that it is a big question that Modi and BJP are making 'smoke base' promises during the assembly elections in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh too
 isko ve kitna puraa karenge, is par sawalia nishaan he
 On the other hand, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has not said anything on this matter yet

 online antertenment channel da viral fever (TVF) ke siio or sansthaapak arunabh kumaar par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha or ab is maamle main mumbai police ne aakhirkaar FIR darj kar lee he
 Actually Arunabh Kumar was accused of molestation by one of his female employees
 bataa den ki indian follar idi se ek blog likhaa gaya he
 In the blog written with The Indian Uber- 'date is TVF' headline, the woman mentioned the incidents of molestation
 mahila ne blog main likhaa main apni puri aapbeetee likhi thi ki kaise uski mulaakaat arunabh kumaar se hui or phir kaise uske saath ghatnaon ko anjaam diya gaya
 In the case of the TVF CEO accused of molesting the police, the victim's statement in the blog, the woman also claimed that Arunabh Kumar did not desist from his antics despite threatening the police complaint
 mahila kaa daawa he ki arunabh kumaar ne police ko apni jeb main hone kii baat kahi thi
 On this matter, there was also a clarification from TVF in which the woman's accusation was told a lie
 is puri ghatana main kai mahilaon ne khulkar soshal media par likhaa lekin aakhir tak is maamle main peedita kii pahchaan ujagar nahin hui
 The new statement of TVF, Arunabh is facing allegations
 Well-known lawyer Rizwan Siddiqui intervened in the case and lodged a complaint with Mumbai's MIDC police station
 siddiki kaa aarope he ki police is maamle main unka saath nahin de rahi lekin aakhir kar IPC kii dhara 509 or 354 (A) ke tahat ke maamla darj kar liya gaya he or police maamle kii jaanch main juty he
 Former female employee accused of molesting TVF CEO jammu kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne ke liye kadam uthaane kaa samay modi sarkaar ke liye isse behatar nahin ho saktaa tha
 Sources have claimed this
 darasal, modi sarkaar teen talaak vidheyak or artiai sanshodhan vidheyak rajyasabha main paarit karaane main safal rahane ke baad is saahasik kadam ko uthaane ke liye protsaahit hui
 Sources said that with the imposition of President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir and the dissolution of the state assembly, the central government has complete control over the affairs of this state
 rajyasabha main bijd, annadramuk or wiesar congress sahit kuch partiyon kaa samarthan milane par bhaajapa nit rajg sarkaar pichley 10 dinon main ucch sadan main teen talaak or artiai sanshodhan vidheyak paarit karaane main safal rahi thi
 Let me tell you, BJP does not have majority in the Upper House
 sutron ne bataaya ki ucch sadan main do ahm vidheyakon ke paarit hone se sarkaar is tarah kaa ek saahasik kadam uthaane ke liye protsaahit hui
 Taking an unprecedented step to cut the Amaranath Yatra, the government had asked the devotees and tourists to leave Jammu and Kashmir
 modi sarkaar ko anuchhed 370 par rajya sabha main aam aadmi party or basapa jaisi partiyon kaa bhi apratyaashit rup se samarthan mila
 While on other issues, these parties are often in conflict with the bjp-led government

 Asha Ranjan, wife of Rajdev Ranjan, a journalist killed in Siwan, has expressed doubts that Shahabuddin may attack her and try to harm her
 aashaa ranjan or unka parivaar rajdev ranjan kii hatya ke peeche shahabuddin kaa haath hone kaa shaq jataata rahaa he
 After the release of Shahabuddin who has been in jail for the last 11 years in many serious cases, Asha Ranjan's fears have increased that her voice may be tried
 aashaa ranjan ne ek nijee channel par die shahabuddin ke us bayaan ko bhi aade haathon liya he jisamen unhone kaha he ki sibiai ne maamla dekhne ke baad ise apane haath main lene laayak nahin samajha or waapas kar diya
 Asha Devi's question is that what the central government and its ministry were unable to tell, how did Shahabuddin become aware of it while he was in jail
 agar is maamle main unka koi lenaa-dena nahin he to phir is maamle main jaankaree ekatrit karne kii unako jarurat kya he? Shahabuddin has clarified on Asha Ranjan's allegations that he has nothing to do with the case
 enditivi se baatcheet main shahabuddin ne kaha ki na to ve is maamle main namjad hai or na hi unke khilaaf koi chargeshit hui he
 On the contrary, they are accusing Asha Ranjan of doing politics with the help of BJP
 jabaki aashaa ranjan kaa saaf kahana he ki nyaay kii khatir ladaai main jo bhi madad ko aage aayega ve uski madad lengi
 Asha Ranjan says that after Shahabuddin's release, her challenge has increased, but she will not back down
 aashaa ranjan maamle kii sibiai jaanch ke liye aidi chotii kaa jor laga rahi hai
 She has met Home Minister Rajnath Singh on this demand
 lekin philhal unke haath maayusi hi haath lagi he
 According to Asha Ranjan, the Home Minister did not give him any firm confidence
 kaha ki sibiai jaanch hogi lekin isamen vakt lagegaa
 The reason behind this, Asha Ranjan said, was that the CBI has a lot of work to do and its busyness is high
 tippaniyan Rajdev was killed on 13 May this year
 teen din baad rajya sarkaar ne isaki sibiai jaanch kii anushansa kar di thi
 But the Central Government has not yet handed it over to the CBI
 aashaa ranjan pichley kai dinon se dilli main rahakar sarkaar se guhaar laga rahi hai
 Even after meeting the Home Minister, he has not been able to know where the matter is stuck
 ab unki koshish pradhanmantri se bhi mulaakaat karne kii he
 Asha Ranjan is also angry with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unka kahana he ki sirf anushansa kar dene se bihar sarkaar kii jimmedaari khatm nahin hoti
 He should have pressured the Center to hand over the case to the CBI soon
 faisla jald nahin hua to aashaa ranjan is maamle ko hoicourt main le jaakar ladengi
 Asha Ranjan has also slammed Shahabuddin's statement on a private channel in which he has said that the CBI did not consider it worth taking into account after seeing the case and returned it
 aashaa devi kaa sawaal he ki jo baat kendra sarkaar or uskaa mantralay nahin bataa paa rahaa aakhir uski jaankaree jail main band rahane ke dauraan shahabuddin ko kaise ho gai
 If they have nothing to do in this matter, then what is their need to collect information in this matter? aashaa ranjan ke aaropon par shahabuddin kii safai he ki is maamle se unka koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Speaking to NDTV, Shahabuddin said that neither he was named in the case nor was there any charge sheet against him
 ulta ve aashaa ranjan par bijepi kii madad se raajnneeti karne kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Whereas Asha Ranjan clearly says that whatever help will come forward in the fight for justice, they will take her help
 aashaa ranjan kaa kahana he ki shahabuddin kii rihaai ke baad unki chunauti bad gai he, lekin ve peeche nahin hatengi
 Aidi is pushing for a peak in the CBI investigation of the Asha Ranjan case
 is maang ko lekar ve grahamantri rajnath singh se mil chuki hai
 But at the moment his hand is hopeless
 aashaa ranjan ke mutabik grih mantri ne unhen koi thos bharosa nahin diya
 Said that there will be a CBI inquiry but it will take time
 bakaul aashaa ranjan iske peeche kaaran yah bataaya gaya ki sibiai ke paas bahut kaam he or uski vyastata adhik he
 The comments rajdev kii hatya isi saal 13 may ko hui thi
 Three days later, the state government recommended a CBI inquiry
 lekin kendra sarkaar ne abhi ise sibiai ko nahin saunpa he
 Asha Ranjan has been in Delhi for the past several days, pleading with the government
 grahamantri se mulaakaat ke baad bhi unako pataa nahin chal paaya he ki maamla kahaan atka he
 Now he tries to meet the Prime Minister too
 aashaa ranjan bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se bhi naaraaz hai
 He says that giving the recommendation only does not end the responsibility of the Bihar government
 use chahie tha ki kendra par dabaav daalati ki maamla jald sibiai ko saunpa jaae
 If the decision is not made soon, Asha Ranjan will fight the matter by taking it to the High Court
 aashaa ranjan ke aaropon par shahabuddin kii safai he ki is maamle se unka koi lenaa dena nahin he

 The Jharkhand Land Revenue Department is in the process of bringing a law, after its implementation, no legal action will be taken against any officer or employee in land related matters
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is kanoon main aise praavdhaan kiye gaye hai jiske tahat vibhaag ke adhikariyon or karmiyon par chal rahe puraane maamle bhi khud-ba-khud khatm ho jaaenge
 This proposed law has been drafted
 ise bahut jald hi rajya cabinet main bheja jayega
 When it is approved, it will be placed in the assembly
 vidhansabha se paas hote hi yah adhisuchana kanoon ban jayega
 What is the new law? The state government believes that due to the enactment of this law, land related matters will be settled soon
 saath hi vibhaag se jude karmi or adhikari bina kisi bhay or vibhageeya karrwai na hone kii guarantee se sahi tareeke se kaam kar sakenge
 The government also believes that due to the fear of action in land related matters, the work in this department is stuck for a long time
 jameen lut kii khuli chhotah vipakshais kanoon ke charchaa main aane ke saath hi iske durupyog kii charchaa bhi shuru ho gai he
 Almost all opposition parties are describing this law as a means of plundering the land
 unka kahana he ki rajya main bijepi sarkaar ke aane ke baad se hi sarkaar jameen luutane ke kaam kar rahi he
 Whether it is a land bank case, an attempt to amend the CNT-SPT Act or a case of giving land to small companies through Momentum Jharkhand

 It is clear that what is the intention of the government? kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ke andar jari sangharsh ke bich ek or sibiai adhikari ne supreme court main guhaar lagaai he
 CBI DIG Manish Kumar Sinha, challenging the transfer order, said that he has been transferred to change the course of investigation in an important case
 apni arji main manish kumaar ne daawa kiya ki jaanch ke dauraan aaropee ne maujuuda rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kaa naam liya
 Along with the postponement of the transfer order, Manish Kumar has appealed to the court to investigate the transfer case with the Special Investigation Team (SIT)
 manish kumaar se court se kaha he ki unka tabadalaa sibiai se nagpur karke ek varisht adhikari rakesh asthana ko phayda pahunchane kii koshish kii gai he
 Significantly, Manish Kumar Sinha was investigating an important case of taking bribe against CBI officer Rakesh Asthana
 sinha ne court se kaha he ki asthana ne rishwat lekar hyderabad ke ek kaarobaari satish sanaa ko sibiai ke samman se bachane main madad karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Satish Sana is a co-accused in a CBI investigation in several cases going on against meat trader Moin Qureshi
 satish sanaa par bhi mani londering ke maamle main jaanch ho rahi he
 CBI vs CBI: Alok Verma met to answer and in a 3-hour Supreme Court plea, Manish Kumar said that on 16 October 2018, CBI arrested one of the accused Manoj Prasad as soon as he reached Delhi from Dubai
 giraftaar ke saath sibiai ke adhikari manoj kumaar ko dilli sthit sibiai mukhyalay par le gaye
 But after reaching CBI headquarters for a few hours, Manoj Kumar acted as a bully to the officers instead of answering questions
 poochtacha main sahyog karne kii jagah manoj kumaar ne sibiai adhikariyon ko dhamkaane ke liye ucche padon par asin adhikariyon se apane najdiki rishte kaa hawala diya
 Manish Kumar told the court that the accused Manoj, who was arrested, claimed that his father Dineshwar Prasad has retired from the Intelligence Department as Joint Secretary and he has a very close relationship with the current National Security Advisor Ajit Doval
 manish kumaar ne bataaya ki sibiai mukhyalay pahunchane ke baad sabase pehle manoj ne ajit dobhaal kaa hawala dete hue poochtacha kar rahe adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa karaane kii dhamkee tak di
 Manoj Prasad even claimed that his younger brother Somesh Prasad is also very close to an officer in Dubai and he has a very good relationship with Samant Goel, the current special secretary in the intelligence department
 lihaaja in rishton kaa istemaal karte hue vah jaanch kar rahe adhikariyon ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 In Uttar Pradesh's Yogi cabinet, 'apna Dal' is also reported to be angry with the government after the minister Om Prakash Rajbhar showed a rebellious attitude
 sutron ke mutabik upi main 9 vidhayakon vaala apana dal rajyasabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke khilaaf voting kaa faisla tak le saktaa he
 According to sources, many mlas of the Apna Dal are unhappy with the functioning of the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh
 apana dal ke vidhayakon kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar kaa unke prati vyavhaar thik nahin he
 According to the information, Apna Dal, the nda's ally, is going to have a meeting with nine of its mlas for the Rajya Sabha elections
 kendriya swasthya rajyamantri or apana dal kii netaa anupriya patel apane vidhayakon ke saath baithak karengi
 In this meeting it will be decided whether to vote in favor of NDA or any other party in the Rajya Sabha elections
 agar apana dal bhi suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh om prakaash rajbhar kii tarah rajyasabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko vot nahin karne kaa faisla letaa he to bhaajapa ke liye upi se 9waan rajyasabha ummidavaar jitaana sambhav nahin ho paaegaa
 Let me tell you that Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party President, an ally in the Yogi government, and Om Prakash Rajbhar, a minister in the Yogi cabinet, has launched a big attack on his own government
 rajbhar ne aarope lagaaya he ki maujuuda upi sarkaar sirf mandiron par dhyaan de rahi he
 The government is not paying attention to the poor who voted for it
 rajbhar ne saaf kaha ki sulah samjhaute ko lekar ab wo yogi kii baat nahin maanenge, jo bhi baat hogi saaf-saaf hogi or sidhe amit shah se hogi
 There will be no talk under Amit Shah
 rajbhar ne 23 march ko hone ja rahe rajyasabha chunaav main bijepi ko samarthan na dene elaan kiya he
 The countdown to putting Asaram behind bars forever has started
 ji haa! maheene bhar pehle jodhpur police ne asaram ke khilaaf jo chargeshit daakhil kii thi use aakiri anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye adaalat main buudhvaar se baqayada muqadama shuru hone ja rahaa he
 Through the evidence of all evidence and witnesses, this case will now decide what is the truth of the crimes of Asaram? For the last two months, people searching for Asaram come to Jodhpur Central, not their ashrams
 pichley do maheenon se yahi central jail asaram kaa temprari adress ban chukaa he
 The prison gate opens and closes, but the desire to come out of Asaram dies every time
 magar, ab to jodhpur police ne jaise isi central jail ko asaram kaa permanent adress banane kii ulti gitni shuru kar di he
 Because the police, who filed a charge sheet against Asaram with a long list of charges, now want to put him in the dock
 subooton ke aaine main unka sach benaqaab kar gavaahon ke bayanon se unki kalai kholana chaahati he
 Because the trial on the charges against Asaram has come in the court, and if these charges on Asaram prove to be true after this trial starting on Wednesday i
e
 October 4, then it will surely be open to Asaram forever
 Breathing in the air will become a dream
 kyonki asaram ke khilaaf 14 alag-alag dhaaraon main daakhil is chargeshit kaa faqat ek hi ilzaam unhen taumr ke liye salaakhon ke peeche rakhane ko kaafii he, jabaki asaram par lage sabhi ke sabhi ilzaam behad sangeen hai
 The police has also filed a charge sheet against Asaram under 376 (f) and 375 (c) in addition to all other legal sections
 jiskaa matlab kisi bhi shikshak, rishtedaar, abhibhavak yaa dharmaguru dwaara kisi ladki se balaatkaar karnaa or kisi ladki ke saath jismani taur par chhedchhad karnaa he or in donon hi gunahon main das saal se lekar umr qaid tak kii sazaa mumkin he
 Moreover, the police have also charged against Asaram under Section 370 (A) of the IPC and sections of the Poxo Act
 or in sabhi kii sabhi dhaaraon main adhiktam sazaa ke taur par umr qaid ho sakati he
 Law experts say that in such a situation, if Asaram is able to cross through any one stream, then the other streams will prove to be a big problem for him
 police ne asaram ke khilaaf darj is mukademe se 140 gavaahon kii lambii fehrist taiyaar kii he
 While the victim girl's statement under section 164 of the crpc, Asaram's disciples' confessions, ecological evidence, and other evidence may prove to be important aspects of the case
 adaalat asaram par lage sangeen ilzaamon or shuruaati chaanbin ke nateezon ke maddenzar hi asaram kii zamaanat arzi thukaraati rahi he
 And in this case, this trial is the most important step between making Asaram a criminal
 ek asaram or chaudaa dharaenyon shoshan ke ilzaam main giraftaar asaram ko jodhpur police ne 14 kanoonee dhaaraon main kuch aisa lapeta he ki ab asaram ke liye khuli hawa main saans lenaa mushkil nazar aa rahaa he
 From the rape to child sexual harassment and even the trafficking of child trafficking, the book of accounts of all the crimes of Asaram will be accounted for by this case
 or sachmuch baba kii pareshaani kii ati ho gai
 The Jodhpur Police has wrapped Baba in such a condition of law that Baba's Central Jail may now become his permanent address

 is beemaari ke ilaaj ke liye asaram kii arzi ko manzur karte hue court ne jail prashasan se ayurveda ke mahiron kii madad lene kaa hukum diya he
 Earlier, Asaram has demanded a special lady doctor several times for this disease
 haalanki asaram kii ek or arzi adaalat ne khaarij kar di he, jisamen unhone peedit ladki ke kol detail kii maang kii thi
 The court has declared it to be non-essential
 asaram kaa jeena muhaal kar detii he rahasyamayi beemaariasaram ko bhi ek kamaal kii beemaari he
 One who does not climb does not climb, but when climbing, it makes life difficult
 lebar pen yani prasav vednaa jaisi dard kii vajah se asaram tadap uthte hai
 Then neither one gets up nor sits down from them
 lekin hairaani ye he ki is beemaari kaa pataa naa to emarai se chalata he naa hi blad test se
 Moreover, Modern Medical Science fails in all its ways in this disease
 asaram khud ko pichley 13 saalon se jis beemaari kaa shikaar bataate rahe hai, agar vaaki us beemaari kaa ilaaj ayurveda main maujuud he, to asaram ko adaalat ke is faisale se faaydaa milanaa tay he
 Since the court has been dealing with Asaram in a very strict manner for the last two months, Asaram has breathed a sigh of relief for the first time in the last two months
 ab dekhnaa ye ki ayurveda ke acharya unki beemaari kaa ilaaj kar pate hai yaa phir allopathy kii tarah ulajh kar rah jate hai

 In one week, Maharashtra BJP has included two Nationalist Congress Party veterans in its court by giving them lotus
 purv chikitsa shiksha mantri dow
 Vijay Kumar Gavit was inducted into the party by BJP leader Eknath Khadse on Saturday
 gavit ko ensipi ne kuch dinon pehle hi unki beti hina gavit ke bijepi se loksabhaa ke tikat par chunaav ladane ke baad party se nikaala tha
 Heena had defeated veteran Congress leader Manikrao Gavit, a 9-time MP from Nandurbar
 vahiin guuruuvaar ke din purv adivasee kalyaan mantri babanrao pachapute ko khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne party kii sadsyta thamai thi
 Significantly, both the leaders have been facing serious allegations of corruption, BJP and Shiv Sena members had adjourned the house by raising their voice against them many times
 haalanki ab party apane nae sadasyon kaa bachaav kar rahi he
 Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Eknath Khadse said that if evidence is found against Vijay Kumar Gavit, we will not only expel him from the party, but will also recommend investigation against him himself
 babanrao pachapute par mantri pad par rahane ke dauraan adivasee kalyaan ke liye kharide gaye saamaan main farjivade kaa aarope he
 Vijay Kumar Gavit is also accused of possessing disproportionate assets and medical scam, apart from this scam, a case was registered against Gavit by the Anti Corruption Bureau immediately after leaving the NCP
 bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad in aaropon par safai dete hue gavit ne kaha congress nahin chaahati thi ki main nandurbaar main rahun, lekin log mere saath hai kyonki hamane ilaake main vikaas kiya he
 By the way, a few days ago, the congress-ncp was patronizing Gavit and Pachpute in all the allegations, now the BJP attacking them is clearly telling them, maybe ideology does not matter in the elections and all parties will follow this formula

 bihar ke mujffarpur ke swadhar grih (balika grih) main ladakiyon ke saath hue yon shoshan ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya tha
 The biggest question raised by this mistreatment of girls is that such organizations running in the name of social welfare are not only doing economic scams with funding from the government but are also becoming a place of exploitation for women instead of security
 
 rashtriya mahila ayog nirikshan kar aise ghotalebaj swadhar grihon kii report taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Soon after this nationwide inspection, the detailed report will be submitted to the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare

 "for example, what are the facilities in Swadhar Greh? Are there any skills being taught for the livelihood of the women living there? How long have they been living? Vagairaha Vagairaha

 In 404 Swadhar Grehs registered in the list, a format has also been sent for assessment
 118 swadhar grihon ke nirikshan ke liye rajya ke mahila ayog ko soochna jari kii ja chuki he
 The Women's Commission has so far sent a report to the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare indicating the condition of the Swadhar Homes
 ayog kii adhyaksh rekha sharma ne bataaya, ‘‘ haalanki abhi nirikshan jari he lekin afsosjanak baat yah he ki ab tak jin swadhar grihon ke nirikshan ke aadhaar par aankalan ham kar paaen hai, unamem se kai aise grih hai jahaan is yojana ke disha nirdeshon kii dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi hai
 "women Commission chairman Rekha Sharma said," After the commission report is completed, they will send detailed information to the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare
 uske baad tay kiya jayega ki swadhar grihon ke fund ke naam par ghapala karne vaale in gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke saath kya kiya jaae?’’darasal mujffarnagar main balika grih main hue ladakiyon ke yon shoshan ke baad yah baat khulkar samaane aa gai he sarkaar main acchhee paith rakhane vaale dabang samaaj kalyaan ke naam par sarkari funding lekar sansthaaon ko gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyo kaa adda bana rahe hai

 It also included old age, short stay, open shelter
 lekin is moti rakam main se sabase jyaad paisa, 40 lakh ru
 In the name of the girl child, Brajesh's account was being deposited in the name of the government fund for years
 dekhnaa yah he ki mahila ayog kii vistrut report aane ke baad or kitne ‘brajesh thakur’ kaa naam saamne aate hai
 Obviously, when such faces are exposed, the names of many government officials and leaders will also be revealed
 yah to puri report saamne aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa ki sarkaar samaaj kalyaan ke naam par sarkari khajaana lut rahe logon se kaise nipategi?disha nirdeshon kii andekhinium ke mutabik 5 saal se zyada yahaan par peedita ko nahin rahanaa chahie
 But in many places this period was found to be longer

 Good luck It can be said about the 12 districts of Uttar Pradesh where voting will be held on Sunday that this time the contest will be Samajwadi Party vs Samajwadi Party
 uski vajah yah he ki mulaayam singh-akhilesh yadav kaa garh itawa, mainpuri, eta kannauj or auraiya main bhi chunaav isi din hona he
 People in the capital Lucknow will also decide the fate of the leaders on Sunday itself
 jin 12 jilon main chunaav hone hai vah hai sitapur, barabanki, lakhanu, unnav, kanpur, kanpur dehaat, auraiya, itawa, mainpuri, kannauj, hardoi or farrukhabad
 The biggest challenge for Akhilesh Yadav will be to repeat the Samajwadi Party's performance in the region in the 2012 assembly elections
 ravivaar ko jin 69 siton par chunaav hona he unamem se 55 siten akele samaajawaadee party ne jeet lee thim
 The BSP had got 6 seats and the BJP could get only 5 seats
 do siten congress ko mili thi jabaki ek seat par nirdaleey ummidavaar jeeta tha
 This will be a big challenge for Akhilesh Yadav in this election, whether he is able to reach his previous figures or not, because it is believed that Mulayam Singh Yadav has a good hold in these areas, but what happened in the party in the past is the result It is expected to be affected
 ravivaar ko hi mulaayam singh yadav kii choti bahu aparnaa yadav kii kismat kaa faisla lakhanu kaint main hoga to bispi chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue brijesh pathak lakhanu madhya se kismat aajamaayenge
 While Congress leader PL Punia's son Tanuj Punia is in the fray from Barabanki, Nitin Agarwal, son of Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal, is seeking voter blessings from Hardoi
 shivpal yadav jaswant nagar se maidan main he to congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hui reeta bahuguna joshi ko aparnaa yadav se muqabla karnaa he
 bjp's performance in Lucknow will be watched by everyone as Rajnath Singh is an MP from here
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main lakhanu kii 9 siton main se bijepi sirf ek seat jeet pai thi
 But the biggest test in the third phase of voting will be whether Akhilesh Yadav has won the hearts of the voters in his constituency after winning the battle in the party and the Election Commission
 samaajawaadee party ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki itawa mainpuri eta ke ilaake main kai seat aisi he jisapar bhitarghaat kii ashanka he
 The Yadav population in this entire area is quite large and if the Muslim voters join it then the way forward for the Samajwadi Party can be quite easy
 lekin tisare charan main pichhadanaa samaajawaadee party ko bahut mahangaa pad saktaa he
 Polling will also be held in Farrukhabad in this phase, which is famous for potato production
 is baat par bhi sabaki nigahen hongi kii notebandi kaa asar chunaav main kya gul khilaataa he
 He said, "bengal Cricket Association has done a good job by starting district cricket, but i think it is important to look at the state of club cricket in Kolkata

 Cash shortages have suddenly increased in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra
 aarthik maamalon ke sachiv es
 c Garg held a press conference on Tuesday and denied the cash-strapped news with the government
 es
 C
 Garg said that the government is increasing the printing of five hundred currency notes five times
 unhone bataaya ki maujuuda vakt main har din jitne 500 ke jitne note chaape ja rahe hai, unki kul keemat 500 karod he
 Which will be increased five times to Rs 2500 crore per day
 2000 ke note par kya bole gargaschiv es
 c Garg admitted that the supply of new 2000 rupee note has been stopped for the last few months
 iske peeche unhone ye tark diya ki 6 lakh rupee se zyada ke mulya ke 2000 ke note pehle se hi chalan main hai or ye paryaapt hai
 2000 notes reduced in banks He also believed that 2000 notes have reduced deposits in banks and people are keeping them with them
 lekin jab unase poocha gaya ki kya 2000 ke note kam hone or nagdi kaa sankat hone ke peeche ye bhi kaaran ho saktaa he ki log phir se nagdi ke rup main kaala dhan jamaa kar rahe hai, to unhone iskaa jawaab nahin main diya
 On this question he replied that he cannot say anything on this
 kya he jaankaron kii ryhalanki, jaanakaron kaa maananaa he ki note kii kami hone ke liye kai kaaran jimmedaar hai
 Ashwani Rana, vice-president of the National Organization of Bank Workers, said that there are four main reasons for this
 -unhone bataaya ki pehla kaaran ye he ki 2000 ke note kii supplai band he or jo log ise le rahe hai wo ise bainkon main jamaa karne ke bajaay apane paas jamaa kar rahe hai
 Second reason is that by printing 200 new notes, the government has removed the market, but not enough changes have been made to remove this new note in the atms of all banks
 -teesri vajah he ki jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai vahaan badi maatra main log nagdi apane paas jamaa kar rahe hai
 -the fourth reason why farmers also shop for farming at this time
 kyonki kheti ke liye sari kharidari nagad main hi hoti he isliye gaanvon main bhi nagdi khap rahi he

 The biggest difficulty is the persistent depletion of foreign exchange reserves
 pradhanmantri ke vittiya salaahkaar ne april main washington main hui iemef (antarrashtriya mudra kosh) or vishwa bank kii salanaa baithak main bhaag lekar lautne ke baad kaha ki iemef ne november, 2008 main liye gaye karj kaa bakaayaa chukaane main madad karne ke liye pakistan ko 5 arab dollar ke karj kii peshkash kii he
 Pakistan had taken a loan from the World Bank in 2008, struggling with a severe balance of payments crisis
 us samay videshi mudra bhandar ek maheene main hone vaale aayaat ke bhugtan se bhi kam rah gaya tha or bank ke paas karency khatm ho chuki thi
 Pakistan's financial structure was on the verge of collapse; The stock market was "stalled" and all withdrawals of mutual funds were halted
 rupye ke mulya main baari giravat or videshi mudra khaaton ke band hone kii afvaahon ke bich log dollar kharidne ke liye daud pade the jisase desh kii videshi mudra baahar jane lagi thi or banking pranali se baari maatra main nakad nikalataa ja rahaa tha
 Due to this, the value of the Pakistani rupee had fallen by 25 percent in just one year
 is tej giravat se ghabaraae logon ne apane rupye ko teji se dollar main badla or puunji kii disha dubai kii ore mud gai
 Today, memories of those days are again fresh in public discussion
 ek baar phir rupaya kamjor padane laga he or isse pehle ki sarkaar prashasnic upayon ke jariye ise majboot karti disambar main dollar ke mukaable uski keemat 100 kii manovaigyanik seemaa ko thode samay ke liye laangh gai
 The rupee's situation improved a bit due to the measures taken by the government, but in the last week of April, the rupee was definitely again in the mutual transactions of banks at Rs 100
 prati dollar ke aankade ko chuaa
 Many players of the money market predict that if the devaluation trend is the same, then by the time of the swearing in of the new government in the country, the rupee will become even more weak
 is samay bhi sabase badi chintaa kam hota videshi mudra bhandar he
 Total cash foreign exchange reserves as on July 18, 2011 as per the final data released by State Bank of Pakistan
 3 arab dollar ke sheersh par tha jahaan se girtaa hua vah aaj 12 arab dollar par ja pahunchaa he
 But this figure can be misleading because it contains 5
 1 arab dollar commercial bainkon kaa hissaa he jabaki pakistan ke state bank kaa sirf 6
 8 billion dollars, which will not be sufficient even for one month of imports
 2008 ke vittiya sankat main banker se vitt mantri ke pad tak pahunchane vaale shaukat tareen kehete hai, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata he ki ham abhi utane bure str tak pahunche hai
 Within a few weeks of assuming office, he had put Pakistan's point of view at the IMF meeting
 haalanki, unhone ‘‘agali sarkaar ke gathan ke do se teen maheene ke bheetar’’ mudra bhandar ko waapas samrudh karne ke liye thos kadam uthaane kii ahmiyat kii ore bhi ishaara kiya
 Apart from depletion of reserves, the next major challenge is the fiscal deficit
 sarkaar barason se ghate ko sakal gharelu utpaada ke 4 fisadi tak laane kii koshish kar rahi he lekin yah 7 fisadi se neeche nahin ja rahaa
 There are many reasons for this
 pehla he power kshetra kii sabsidi jo upabhoktaaon ko mil rahi dar main kareeb 75 fisadi kii badhotaree karne ke baavjood pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) sarkaar ke liye sirdard ban gai
 Despite this, the outgoing Finance Minister of the PPP had loudly announced that in five years, the Government of Pakistan alone had spent one lakh crore in electricity subsidy
 se adhik kaa bhugtan kiya jo kul vaarshik rajasav sangrah kaa lagbhag aadha he
 This figure is very large
 lekin kisi ko nahin maaloom ki apane rajnatik vajood ko khatre main daale bagaiyr ise kaise ghataya jaae
 The result is "circular debt" - continuously increasing liabilities at the level of oil imports where eventually the debt burden is becoming over the country
 yued ke saath kiye gaye yojana ayog ke ek adhyayan ke mutabik pichley vittiya varsh ke ant tak circular date (rin) 847 arab ru
 Had reached
 yah bahut zyada vruddhi he kyonki yahi aankada is sarkaar ke satta main aane ke samay 100 arab dollar se bhi kam tha
 The same study has shown that Pakistan's growth rate is less than 4 per cent due to the power crisis
 desh main bijli or prakritik gas main sabase zyada share rakhane vaali nirmaan companiyon ke sanghathanon main se ek ingro ke purv siio asad umr kehete hai, ‘‘pakistan kisi bhi haal main isse nikal nahin saktaa

 The increase in domestic debt is a cause for concern for Pakistan
 aise kanoon bhi hai jisamen sarkaar ko khaas hidaayat di gai he ki kul rin str jidipi ke 60 fisadi se zyada na bade
 But like other laws, this law is also being neutralized
 isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki isamen kahin is baat ko chinhit nahin kiya gaya he ki nirdhaarit rin seemaa kaa ulanghan hone par kis tarah ke pratibandh lagaae ja sakate hai
 Salim Raza, former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, says that the importance given to the loan is misleading
 kyonki ‘‘asli mudda tex or jidipi kaa anupaat he’’ jo darshata he ki desh kitna karj le saktaa he
 He explains, "our tax-gdp ratio is 9 percent
 ’’ unka kahana he ki anya ubharate bazaaron ke liye adarsh maanak 18 or 25 fisadi ke bich kahin bhi ho saktaa he
 "about 40 per cent of the government's revenue is spent to pay the loan installment
" ’’ pakistan kii puri banking pranali main lagi dhanrashi jidipi kaa 35 fisadi he jabaki kul gharelu dendaree 40 pratishat he
 That is, the size of the total debt in Pakistan is much more than the total money in the banking system
 jabaki adhiktar deshon main hisaab-kitaab iske thik ulat he
 Economic managers of Pakistan have long been pondering the question of how they should align development with economic stability
 baari maatra main videshi madad aane ke kaaran yah sawaal fori taur par haashie par chalaa jaataa rahaa he, jaisaa ki musharraf kii sarkaar ke samay hua
 But the biggest challenge before the latter governments was how they could revive the economy, along with the basic economic indicators like inflation and fiscal deficit, amid the declining foreign economic support and rising expectations of indigenous and foreign characters
 Be killed pakistan par kudarat meharbaan rahi he or isi vajah se yah baar-baar ubarta rahaa he
 But now the water crisis is increasing due to which the agricultural economy is collapsing and our food security is in danger
 lekin in jatil chunautiyon se nibatane kaa pakistan ne ek hi upaay nikaala-koi faisla hi na karo
 While one government is going in Pakistan and the other has not come yet, this country is once again in the same dilemma

 unhone westeindies ke purv captain or is team kaa chayan karne vaali juri ke adhyaksh kwive lid par sidhe ungali uthaayi he
 Butt waited until a conversation with the media to announce Lloyd's team as soon as the conference began
 He raised his hand that he wanted to question
 bat ne lid ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki vah keval ek pakistani khilaadi ke chayan se naakhush hai jabaki unke desh ke anya khilaadiyon ne bhi acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The report said, Lloyd stated that many players who performed well in the team were not retained because the jury also looked at the balance of the team while selecting it
 sutron ne bataaya ki bat of spinner said ajmal or ballebaaj misabah ul haq kaa chayan nahin hone se naakhush the

 Senior critic of Hindi Purushottam Agarwal expressed his displeasure at not giving proper place to tribals and folk artists at the Raiyapur Sahitya Mahotsav
 unhone kaha ki yah samskruti or lok kala ko samarpit utsav main lok kalakaaron ko hi samuchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Some folk artists who came to perform at the Sahitya Utsav were sitting on isolated ground in one corner of a courtyard
 unke liye alag se koi pandal yaa koi vyavastha nahin thi
 a crowd of people surrounded them from all over and took pictures of them
 purushottam agarwal ne kaha, 'ham unke saath alian jaisaa vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 As if they are something of a museum
 jab unki samskruti bachaane kaa daawa kar rahe hai, unke bare main ham baat kar rahe hai or ve khud is samvaad se nadaarad hai
 And it is very sad to see that they are not getting that honor and place in the festival being organized by the same tribals, folk artists at the center

 (fruit Juice vs Vegetable Juice) zeus pinaa phydemand he yaa nahin, zeus kis tarah se piya jaae, subjiyon ke zeus or falon ke zeus main koun zyada behatar he? aise kai saare sawaal hai jinke jawaab log dhundte rahete hai
 You may have heard many times that juice helps to remove toxins from the body and relaxes the digestive system, drinking juice once a day cleanses your stomach and gives you plenty of energy
 lekin puri tarah se keval zeus vaali diet par nirbhar rahanaa sahi nahin he
 In the case of juice, we have all kinds of options
 santare ke ek gilaas zeus main prachur maatra main vitamin si hota he, hari subjiyon ke zeus sharir se vifaille padaarth nikaalata he
 Popular mix juice of apple, beet and carrot helps in weight loss
 haalanki, adhiktar logon ke man main yah sawaal rahata he ki falon kaa zeus zyada phydemand he yaa subjiyon kaa zeus
 The answer is - you should follow the 90 / 10 rule in your juice intake
 yani aapke zeus main 90 fisadi sabji ho or 10 fisadi fal ho
 The reason behind this is that fruits contain more natural sugar in the form of fructose
 chaahe zeus ho yaa sookhaa fal, donon main hi sugar zyada hota he kyonki ye kansantret hote hai
 Fruit juice has more sugar than vegetable juice
 jab aap fal kaa zeus nikaalte hai to aap uskaa fibre vaala hissaa nikaal rahe hote hai
 Fiber slows down sugar release but the release of fiber causes more sugar release and increases insulin levels
 bhale hi yah sugar natural hoti he lekin zeus main natural sugar kii bhi zyada maatra bhi insulin ke str par asar daal sakati he
 This increases appetite and leads to things like weight gain
 isiilie apane zeus main keval 10 fisadi hi mithe falon or subjiyon ko aapako shaamil karnaa chahie
 The only exceptions to this rule are lemons and citrus fruits, which have low amounts of natural sugar and do not increase the amount of blood insulin in the blood
 kai health export kaa maananaa he ki falon ke zeus se blad sugar level bad saktaa he isliye diabetes ke marijon ko zeus bahut hi moderation main pinaa chahie
 Nutritionists also recommend that juice should not be consumed in breakfast because it contains carbohydrates, fiber and concentrated sugar, which is very low in protein
 isse aapako bhukh jaldi lag sakati he
 The best way is to consume smoothies or milkshakes, nuts, oats and some fresh fruits together
 pien mausami kaa zeus, hote hai itane saare phydejahaan tak subjiyon ke zeus kii baat he, subjiyon ke zeus se aapako kai tarah ke phaayde ho sakate hai
 You cannot eat many vegetables in one meal, but juice gives you this option
 kai baar logon ko kuch subjiyan khaanaa bilkul pasand nahin hota he
 In such a situation, juice proves to be a good option
 gaajar kaa zeus, chukundar kaa zeus or paalak kaa zeus behtareen vikalp hai
 However, in the case of vegetable juice, the problem of low fiber persists
 iske alaava subjiyan falon kii tulana main zyada kshareey prakruti kii hoti hai or isse pet ke bheetar ph balance bana rahata he yani amleey tatwon or kshareey tatwon kii maatra main santulan bana rahata he
 It is also worth noting that most of our diet contains more acidic food which is more harmful for the body
 aise main subjiyon ke zeus se madad mil sakati he
 View this post on instagramthe best vegetable juice i have ever had! Tomato, carrot, celery, and a little bit of red onion and garlic
 And a pinch of salt
 Noticed i noticed this time and the last time i had carrot and celery, it really helped me cough up some residual phelm
 Sorry if that's TMI, lol
 i just think that is amazing
 i am putting all final reminants of my cold behind me
 V8 has nothing on this

 But if we talk about sugar, then vegetable juice is more beneficial because vegetable juice either contains less sugar or does not exist, whereas the quantity of sugar in fruits is very high
 haalanki, iske baavjood, falon or subjiyon ke zeus ko santulit maatra main liya ja saktaa he
 It is good for children to take fruit juice as it increases the energy level
 kai baar aapke man main yah sawaal uthta hoga ki kisi fal yaa sabji ko aise hi khaaya jaae yaa uskaa zeus nikaalkar piya jaae
 The answer is that eating vegetables is healthier than drinking juice, but if there is a shortage of time, drinking a glass of juice to keep yourself active and hydrated is also not a bad option
 apni diet main alag-alag tarah kii subjiyon ko shaamil karen
 Keep changing or rotating juice vegetables
 ho sake to subjiyon kaa zeus zyada pien or falon kaa zeus kam banaaen

 ' After the crushing defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, many leaders have indirectly targeted Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki janadesh ko sweekaar karte hue rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha dene kii peshkash kar daali
 The Congress Working Committee (CWC) has since passed a resolution rejecting Rahul Gandhi's resignation
 vahiin kai aise netaa bhi saamne aae jinhone rahul gandhi istipha nahin dene ko kaha
 These leaders believe that BJP will disseminate Rahul Gandhi's resignation campaign as his victory 
 in netaaon main argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav bhi shaamil hai, jo chaahate hai ki rahul congress adhyaksh pad par bane rahen or vipaksh kaa netritv karen
 At the same time, senior Congress leader M
 virappa moili ne bhi mangalvaar ko party adhyaksh ke pad par rahul gandhi ke bane rahane kaa samarthan kiya
 He said that defeat in Lok Sabha elections is a matter of strength for this party
 moili ne kaha ki ek do chunaavon ke parinaamon se us party kaa bhavishya tay nahin ho saktaa jisane apane lambey itihaas main kai utaar chadhaav dekhe hai
 Describing Rahul Gandhi as the inspiration for the party, Moily said that it would not be appropriate for him to leave the post of Congress chief
 unhone kaha, keval isliye ki (narendra) modi jeet gaye hai
 
 yah adhyaksh pad chhodane kii koi vajah nahin he
 After all, the ups and downs have been very common for the Congress party
 hamane inhen kai baar dekha he
 Reviving a party is a 5 year process, it takes a leader like him to think long term and bring INC to its rightful position to serve the people of India
 It's not the question of finding a person outside the family
 INC itself is one big family and he belongs to that family

 M
 Veerappa Moily (@moilyv)may 28, 2019moili ne kaha ki congress kaa bhavishya ek loksabhaa chunaav or ek do vidhansabha chunaav tay nahin kar sakate
 He said that Rahul Gandhi should not stick to the matter of resigning from the post and he should keep giving direction to the future of the country and the party
 vahiin loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke pad se istipha dene par ade rahane kii khabaron kii bich congress kii telugana ikai ne unke netritv main bharosa jataayaa he
 Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) President and newly elected MP a Uttam Kumar Reddy said that we request on behalf of the Telangana PCC

 ) In Haryana, BJP is looking for a Jat face: In JJP 22, only five Jat leaders won; In Haryana, BJP is going to form the government for the second time under the leadership of Manohar Lal Khattar
 diwali ke shubh avasar par manohar laal khatter duusari baar haryana ke mukhyamantri pad kii or jejepi pramukh dushyant chautaala dipti siem pad kii shapath lenge
 Governor Satyadev Narayan Arya will administer them
 bijepi ke kai diggaj netaaon ke chunaav haarane ke chalate cabinet main kai chehre ko mauka mil saktaa he
 In the Haryana assembly elections, BJP gave tickets to a total of 22 Jats
 inamen se keval paanch hi jat netaa chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 This time, all the big Jat faces lost the election
 aise main party jat ranneeti ko dekhte hue kisi apane par daanv khelnaa chaahati he
 After the alliance with JJP, BJP is in control of which Jat leader should be appointed as its quota minister
 kalayat seat se vidhayak banikamalesh dhanda ko bijepi mantribanaati he to mantrimandal main mahila ke saath-saath bijepi kaa jat kota bhi puraa ho saktaa he
 Kamlesh Dhanda will be represented by Kaithal district by making him minister
 vaise bhi kamalesh dhanda ko mantri banaaya gaya to ek bada sandesh jayega, kyonki unhone jaiprakash (jepi) jaise bade netaa ko haraaya he
 The BJP leadership is also considering inducting NML Nirmal Choudhary from the MLA in Ganaur
 nirmal choudhary mahila or jat cote ko puraa karti hai
 Nirmal Chaudhary has come out of the Congress by defeating Kuldeep Sharma
 bijepi ke jat cote ke mantri banane waalon kii res main panipat se duusari baar vidhayak bane mahipal dhanda kaa naam bhi chal rahaa he
 Mahipal Dhanda's claim is also made because out of four seats in Panipat district, BJP has won only two seats and Congress has won two seats
 aise main congress ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye party mahipal dhanda ko mantri banane kaa daanv chal sakati he
 Independents may get a chance, however, the idea of who should be made a minister in Jats in BJP is going on till the last moment
 party kisi nirdaleey vidhayak ko jat cote se mantri banane par vichaar kar rahi he
 So that independent mlas can be appeased
 nirdaleey jat vidhayakon main se rohtak kii maham vidhansabha se vidhayak balraj kundu or dadri se vidhayak bane somvir sangwan ko mantri banaae jane kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 Both these mlas were seeking tickets from BJP before the elections
 bijepi se tikat nahin milane par nirdaleey chunaav lade or jitkar aae
 It is reported from the sources that the JJP has cleared the BJP leadership that only the JJP MLA from the Chautala family should be made a minister
 matlab saaf he ki raniya se nirdaleey vidhayak ranjit singh chautaala or ieneldi ke ekmaatr vidhayak abhaya chautaala ko khatter sarkaar ke mantrimandal main jagah nahin di jaaegi
 Ranjit Singh Chautala is the son of former Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Devi Lal and brother of Omprakash Chautala
