 He says that when he made his debut in first-class cricket at the age of 20, he had no idea of playing with the red SG ball

 So you get to know a lot about the game
 lekin agar aapako achaanak kuch alag cheez karne ko kaha jaae, to aapke liye mushkil ho sakati he
 The pacer, who has taken 92 wickets in Tests and 98 in odis, said, "I started playing tennis and rubber balls and until i turned 20, i used to be used more commonly in cricket The ball was not caught

 As i grew up, i learned a lot about fast bowling
 main jis jagah se aata hum, vah tej gendbaajon ko paidaa karne ke liye mashhoor nahin he
 "yadav said," i knew that there were many bowlers who bowled at 130-135 kmph

 input bhashaa se The new video released on youtube for the promotion of Punjabi film 'sadda Haq' has come under controversy
 is video main sikhon ke dasven guru guru govind singh ji or shahid bhagat singh ke saath aatankwaadi jaranel singh bhindrawaale or balavant singh rajoana ko dikhaaya gaya he
 In this song 'baghi' the rebels are glorified, while the makers of this film say that the song only talks about the rebels, but does not compare them to each other, nor do they compare to each other
 adds up
 film ke nirmaataa kuljinder siddhu ne kaha, 'guru govind singh ji apane samay main vidrohi the, lekin agar ham aaj ke samay kii baat karen to rajoana bhi vidrohi he
 It is a song sung by Jazzy b which is designed to promote the film and we agree with Jazzy B
 hamaara kahana he ki sikh samudaay main guruon ke vakt se lekar aaj tak vidrohi hue hai
 Whenever they feel there is something wrong in the system, they go against the system and that is why they are called rebels
 ' Significantly, Balwant Singh Rajoana has been sentenced to death in 1995 for the murder of the then Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh

 Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was a rebel leader who hid in the Golden Temple of Amritsar in 1984 with his armed supporters and fought the Indian Army until he was killed

 dillihai court ne apane faisle main ek 60 saal kii mahila ke saath rape or uski hatya ke aarope main ek vyakti ko sunai gai umrakaid kii sajaa ko maaf kar di
 The order of the lower court was quashed after the judgment of the bench of Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Mukta Gupta
 nichali adaalat ne mahila se nashe kii haalat main kathith taur par rape karne ke jurm main achche laal ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 This woman later died
 court ne kaha, ‘bina kisi andeh ke postmortem report se sabit hota he ki mahila ne bhi sex se pehle sharaab pi rakhi thi
 "he said," If Good Lal is also convicted in the crime of rape, then he cannot be convicted of murder because he neither had the intention nor knew that the woman would be killed by sex
 isliye, use ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat dandaneey aparaadh se bari kiya jaataa he
 'the court while sanctioning the appeal of Good Lal also acquitted him of rape charges,' the woman was over 60 years of age in view of the offense punishable under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC, therefore it was older than the menopause 
 ’ adaalat ne kaha, ‘ham yachikakarta (achche laal) ke vakil kii is daleel se bhi sahamat hai ki agar jabardastee sex hua to bhi yah balpurvak nahin thi or mahila kii isamen rajamandi thi
 'therefore, in our opinion it is not proved beyond doubt that the petitioner had sex with the woman against her will or without her consent,' the bench said
 ’nichali adaalat ne 2011 main achche ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi or us par das hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 The court had said, "he had forced sex with a woman much older than him whom he used to call his mother
" ’ abhiyojan ke mutabik, mahila uttari dilli ke majanuun kaa tila kshetra ke gharon main gharelu sahayika ke taur par kaam karti thi

 According to the police, a prosecution witness who saw the corpse for the first time told the court that he was drunk with good red wine while he was standing outside the woman's house
 gudgaanv ke dipti meyar parminder kataaria ke khilaaf duusari baar shaadi kaa vaada kar dushkarm karne kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Police gave this information on Wednesday
 mahila ne isse pehle pichley saal oktober main aisa hi ek maamla darj karavaaya tha
 The woman said that she had filed a rape complaint against Kataria on December 11, 2015 at the Mahila police station here, but she alleged that the police refused to register a case
 mahila ke anusaar, maamla tab darj kiya gaya, jab mahila ke vakil pradeep kumaar ne gudgaanv ke police upayukta deepak sahaaran ko supreme court ke nirdersho ke avmaananaa ke liye kanoonee notice bheja
 The woman has alleged that Kataria came to her house in December and raped her again
 tippaniyan Significantly, on October 24, 2015, the woman filed a case of rape and criminal intimidation against Kataria and two other people
 iske baad ek disambar ko mahila ne jila adaalat main ek halafanama daayar kiya tha, jisamen usne kaha tha ki vah kataaria or uske parivaar ko jaanati he or unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin chaahati

 ' mahila ne bataaya ki usne yahaan mahila police thane main kataaria ke khilaaf 11 disambar, 2015 ko dushkarm kii ek shikaayat daayar kii thi, lekin usne aarope lagaaya ki police ne maamla darj karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 According to the woman, the case was registered after the woman's lawyer Pradeep Kumar sent a legal notice to Gurgaon Deputy Commissioner of Police Deepak Saharan for contempt of the Supreme Court
 mahila ne aarope lagaaya he ki kataaria disambar main uske ghar aayaa or uske saath phir dushkarm kiya

 Subsequently, on December 1, the woman filed an affidavit in the district court, stating that she knew Kataria and her family and did not want any action against them

 Assistant Police Commissioner Dharna Yadav said that the woman had changed her statement several times since the FIR was first filed
 police adhikari ne kaha, 'mahila kaa aarope he ki disambar main aaropee ek baar phir uske ghar aayaa or uske saath phir dushkarm kiya
 We are investigating the case
 ' Significantly, on October 24, 2015, the woman filed a case of rape and criminal intimidation against Kataria and two other people

 The police officer said, 'the woman alleged that in December, the accused once again came to her house and raped her again

 ' uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey 11 march ko aae or 15 march tak mukhyamantri kii daud main kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh sabase aage rahe
 When Rajnath Singh was asked if he was going to become the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, he has to say two things - all a matter of nonsense
 ab rajnath singh kii is pratikriya kaa matlab nikaala liya jaae to do baaten saaf he, pehla, vah mukhyamantri kii daud main kabhi the hi nahin or doosraa yadi unka naam is daud main shaamil tha to vah khud is pad ko sanbhaalanaa nahin chaahate
 If the second possibility is accepted as true, then the question arises that why Rajnath Singh, who had previously held the post of Chief Minister of the state, now does not want to become Chief Minister again, leaving the post of Home Minister at the Center? 15 saal puraani raajnneetirajanath singh 2000 se 2002 tak uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 After this he became the Minister of Agriculture in the Central Government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 2003 to 2004
 phir 2004 se 2014 ke bich bijepi kii rashtriya raajnneeti main ahm kirdaar nibhaate hue rajnath singh ek baar phir 2014 ke chunaavon se pehle bijepi adhyaksh rahe lekin aam chunaavon main jeet kaa sehranarendra modi or amit shaahake sir bandhaa or unhen kendra sarkaar ne pradhanmantri pad ke baad sabase ahm ohada grih mantri kaa diya gaya
 Now leaving the post of Home Minister and becoming the Chief Minister of a state, it will be like 15 years old politics for Rajnath Singh
 2
 The first Chief Minister was more powerful; Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party governments have been formed in Uttar Pradesh for the last two decades
 yah daur aisa tha jabpradesh kaa mukhyamantridesh ke sabase taqatvar mukhyamantriyon main shumaar tha
 Due to this strength, from time to time, Mulayam Singh and Mayawati from Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have shown their strength to the ruling party of the Center
 lekin ab kendra main bijepi kii sarkaar he or rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 Apparently, due to being a party at the center and the state, now the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh will not have the status in the national politics along with the party which is the home minister of the central government
 3
 In central politics, Demon Rajnath Singh started the political journey in 1984 with the post of the President of the Youth wing of the UP BJP, in 2000, he got the post of Chief Minister of the state
 iske baad 2003 main vah party kii kendra sarkaar main bataur cabinet mantri shaamil hue
 After this, Rajnath Singh served as bjp's national president from 2006 to 2009
 khaas baat yah rahi ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle 2013 main rajaneeth singh ek baar phir party ke adhyaksh bane or party ne unki aguwai main congress ko satta se ukhaad phenkaa or narendra modi kii sarkaar bani
 Having achieved this position in national politics, becoming the chief minister of a state is no less than a demotion for Rajnath Singh
 4
 Modi will get all the credit as Chief Minister, the current politics of Uttar Pradesh is very important
 2014 main rajya ne 80 main se 71 loksabhaa siton par bijepi ko chunaa tha
 This was seen as the clearest sign of the Modi wave
 ek baar phir 2017 main 403 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main bijepi ko 312 seat mili he
 This victory has also been named after Modi wave
 lihaaja, pradesh ke nae mukhyamantri ke saamne behad kadi chunauti rahegi
 Because one thing is clear that as the Chief Minister, he will himself be responsible for every failure in the state and the credit of every success will be recorded directly in the name of the Prime Minister
 5
 The crown of thorns is the chair of UP, the chair of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh is as important as it is full of difficulties
 rajya main beete do dashakon se kshetreey dalon kaa varchasv rahaa he
 The BJP has blamed the governments of the regional parties as well as the Congress governments for the poor state of the state
 pradesh main lachar kanoon-vyavastha or khastahal arthvyavastha ko nayaa aayam dene kii chunauti nae mukhyamantri par rahegi

 in / ek nanhe bachche ke liye maa uski duniya hoti he
 He understands and learns everything from the eyes of the mother
 agar koi daant lagaae to vah maa kaa anchal talashta he
 When happy, he runs away and hugs his mother
 satya he, maa ke jaisaa nishchal prem koi nahin kar saktaa he
 Today (may 13) is Mother's Day
 yun to maa ke liye koi din nahin nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he, lekin din tay hua he to kuch naa kuch to karnaa hi chahie
 Most people give money to the mother and think that the duty is done, but the friend mother does not want money
 maa kaa hisaab karne main sari duniya kii daulat kam pad jaaegi
 The mother wants nothing except that her children are happy
 tabhi to munwwar kehete hai ki -ye aisa qarz he jo main adaa kar hi nahin saktaa,main jab tak ghar na lautun, meri maan sazde main rahati he
 
 
 You cannot imagine your home without a mother
 sari chijen yathasthaan rakhi hui mil jaati he to isamen maa kii mehnat lagi he
 If you want to do something, then reduce the burden of the house on top of the mother
 aaie jaanate hai wo 5 tareeke jinase aap apni maa kii madad kar sakate hai
 1- You are now grown up and can take care of yourself
 choti-choti chizon ke liye maa par nirbhar rahanaa bahut galat he
 You should take care of your clothes, room and things yourself
 2- maa agar ghar kaa koi kaam kar rahi he to isliye nahin ki ye unka kaam he, balki isliye taaki aap logon ko koi dikkat naa ho
 So whenever you see your mother doing some work, help them
 ho sake to kaam main haath bantaayen
 Help in the kitchen too
 aapke bachche kaa dimag hoga tej, roj khilaaen ye cheez3- ham sabhi apane offis se ek-do din kii chuttee lete hai, lekin kya maa kaa wyk of hota he? bilkul nahin
 It would be lovely if the family together decide a day off for the mother
 4- jab bhi maa pukaare unki madad ke liye turant jaaen
 If they were not needed, she would not call
 isliye maa pukaare to sab kaam chhodkar madad ke liye jaaen
 The railway will put the women's compartment in the middle of the train, you will get many facilities

 Whenever eating food, keep your utensils washed, this is a matter of small but very useful, because of this you will be helping mother unknowingly
 agar sambhav ho to maa ko ghar ke kaamkaaj se puri tarah chuttee de den
 Go for a walk with them and eat out
 maa ne apana kartavya nibhaa diya he ab aap kii baari he
 Encouraged by the purchase of buffalo through finance in the villages of the country, the world's largest bicycle company Hero Cycle has also decided to take the same route to increase the sales of its bicycles
 hero cycles ne gramin ilaakon main apni bikri badhaane ke liye microfinance companiyon ke jariye graahakon ko rin dene kii suvidha uplabdh karaane kaa faisla kiya he
 The company has tied up with Sonata Finance of Allahabad for this
 sonata finance gaanv ke logon ko cycle kharidne ke liye 100 rupee prati saptaah kaa karj uplabdh karaayegi
 It is a test case, said Pankaj Munjal, managing director, Hero Cycles
 ham purvi uttar pradesh se shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 After getting success here, we will go to Andhra Pradesh with this concept
 is prayog ko lekar utsahit munjaal ne kaha, jab gramin rin lekar bhens kharid sakate hai, to ve microfinance companiyon ke jariye rin lekar cycle bhi kharid sakate hai
 Munjal said that the idea for financing a bicycle is to make it available to every person whose monthly income is less than the price of the product
 unhone kaha ki kisi gramin kii masik aay 2,500 rupee tak bhi ho sakati he, par kisi financing yojana ke abhaav main vah cycle kharidne ke liye 3,000 rupee kharch nahin kar saktaa
 We want to extend this product to them through financing

 kendriya jaanch beuro (CBI) ne ravivaar shaam ko kolkata ke police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ke ghar par chhapemari kii koshish kii, to bavaal much gaya
 The CBI team arrived for the purpose of interrogating the police commissioner, surrounded by the police and then taken to Vidhan Nagar police station
 iske baad sibiai ke adhikariyon ko police ne hiraasat main le liya, lekin baad main chhod diya
 At the same time, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee came out openly to save Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar
 unhone sabase pehle police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ke ghar kaa daura kiya or phir kolkata ke metro channel par dharna par baith gayi
 Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar also sat on the dharna along with Mamta Banerjee
 is ghatana ke baad se rajeev kumaar surkhiyon main aa gaye hai
 Now the question is arising here, who is Rajiv Kumar, for whom Trinamool Congress (TMC) President Mamata Banerjee sat on a dharna all night
 aakhir koun hai rajeev kumarkolkata ke police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ko mamata banerjee kaa behad bharosemand mana jaataa he
 In 2016, he was made Police Commissioner of Kolkata in place of Surjit and Purkayastha
 saath hi purkysth ko pramot karke siaidi department bhej diya gaya tha
 Prior to this, Rajiv Kumar has been posted as Police Commissioner in Vidhannagar Police Commissionerate
 rajeev kumaar 1989 batch ke pashchim bengal cader ke bhartiya police seva (IPS) ke adhikari hai
 He has also served as the Special Task Force (STF) Chief of Kolkata Police
 rajeev kumaar ne sharada or roj vaili chitfund ghotaalaa maamle kii jaanch karne vaali special investigeshan team (SIT) kaa bhi netritv kiya tha
 This chit fund scam came to light in 2013
 sibiai ne is maamle ke kai ahm dastavejon ke kathith taur par gaayab hone par rajeev kumaar or anya adhikariyon se jaanch main sahyog karne ko kaha tha, lekin wo sibiai ke saamne poochtacha ke liye pesh nahin hue
 Let us tell you that many leaders of the Trinamool Congress are also accused in the much-talked-about Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scam of West Bengal
 is maamle main kai tiemasi netaaon ko jail bhi bheja ja chukaa he
 Mamta told Rajiv Kumar the most honest officer
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has described Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar as the most honest officer in the world
 mamata banerjee ne twit kar kaha, 'kolkata ke police kamishnar duniya ke sabase behtareen adhikariyon main se ek hai
 His integrity, bravery and honesty cannot be questioned
 wo 24 ghante kaam karte hai
 He accused the BJP of spreading lies and said that lies are always lies
 is dauraan mamata ne twit kar bijepi netritv par ghatiya raajnneeti karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said that the BJP leadership is not only targeting political parties, but it is also misusing power to take control of the police and destroy all constitutional institutions

 Mohammad Azam Khan is the name in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, whose magic works in every season
 umr ke 70wein padaav par chal rahe ajam khan chaar dashak se zyada kii chunavi siyasat kar chuke hai or is arase main aisa ek hi mauka aayaa he jab avam ne ajam ko nahin chunaa ho
 Even Modi wave, Yogi wave and Modi tsunami could not shake Azam Khan's strong foundation in Rampur
 maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main ajam khan ne bijepi pratyaashee jaya pradaa ko shikast di he
 During the election campaign, there was fierce rhetoric about the old feud between the two leaders
 yahaan tak ki jaya pradaa par ajam khan kii ek tippanee ke liye unke chunaav prachaar par bain bhi laga or jaya pradaa ne mahila sammaan ko ajam khan ke khilaaf ahm mudda bhi banaaya
 But despite all these controversies and then the Modi tsunami in UP, Azam Khan won his seat by a good margin
 ajam khan ko 5,59,177 vot mili, jabaki jaya pradaa kii ginati 4,49,180 maton par ruk gai
 In this way Azam Khan defeated Jaya Prada by 1,09,997 votes
 achche antar vaali jeet ajam khan ko un halaaton main mili he jab puure desh ke saath upi main bijepi ne ekatarfa jansamarthan hasil kiya he or tamaam virdohi dal dharaashai ho gaye hai
 Even Azam Khan's party SP has been able to win just 5 seats and lost elections to Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav, apart from the family to Dimple Yadav, Dharmendra Yadav and Akshay Yadav
 ye pehla mauka nahin he jab puri party ke parrast hone par bhi ajam khan apana kila bachaane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Azam Khan, along with son Abdullah Azam, had earlier seen similar situations in the 2017 UP Assembly elections
 1980 se upi vidhansabha kii raajnneeti karte aa rahe ajam khan ne 2017 kaa chunaav bhi apni seat rampur se ladaa
 In this election, SP contested the Congress alliance and was defeated badly

 After the government's refusal to give the post of Chairman of the Joint Drafting Committee of Lokpal Bill to a member of civil society and issued a formal notification for it, Gandhian leader Anna Hazare announced on April 13 to launch a nationwide jail
 jail baro andolan kaa aahvaan karte hue hajaare ne logon se is andolan ke dauraan ahimsa par kaayam rahane kii apil kii
 He announced the April 12 date for the Jailbarrow movement and later changed it to April 13
 hajaare ne kaha, ‘main mahasoos karata hum ki deshbhar main gelbaro andolan chalanaa chahie
 But you should take part in this movement by keeping Gandhiji in your mind
 kahin bhi koi hinsa nahin honi chahie
 He said that he had also run the Jail Bharo movement in Maharashtra earlier
 shuukravaar kii subah maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal kii saamaajik kaaryakarta swami agnivesh or arvind kejariwal ke saath baithak honi thi lekin yah baithak nahin hui or donon pakshon ne kaha ki ve ek duusare kaa intjaar karte rahe
 Hazare then announced this
 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kii in donon maangon ko khaarij karte hue sibbal ne yah bhi kaha ki keval sarkari adhikari hi lokapal vidheyak kii praaroop samiti ke sadsy honge or doosraa, yadi naagarik samaaj ne adhyaksh pad ke liye dabaav daalaa to koi bhi mantri uskaa hissaa nahin hoga
 He said, 'there is no possibility of issuing any official notification on the formation of the joint committee but we have told them that we are willing to give the government letter and issue press notes through the Ministry of Law
 hajaare ne berozegaar yuvakon se bhi is andolan main hissaa lene kii apil kii or kaha ki unhen jail main subah kaa naashtaa or do baar bhojan milegaa
 He said that his movement is for decentralization of power in the hands of the people and the proposed Lokpal Bill is a next step in that direction
 isi ke saath unhone spasht kiya ki unki kisi samiti kaa hissaa banane main dilchaspee nahin he
 Kejriwal said that Hazare will send a letter to the Prime Minister suggesting the names of former Chief Justice of the country JS Verma and Justice Santosh Hegde for the post of the chairman of the committee to draft the new Lokpal Bill
 hajaare ne kaha ki is desh main bhrashtachar ko roka ja saktaa he yadi is rog ke khilaaf sangharsh main juty agenciyon ko sarkaar ke bajaay lokapal ke adheen le aayaa jaae
 He said, 'CBI, Vigilance Committees or other committees etc
 which are expected to prevent corruption are under the government
 chunki ve sarkaar ke antargat kaary rahi hai isliye bhrashtachar nahin ruuk rahaa
 "CBI investigated many big cases before and after Bofors," Hazare said
 lekin kya abtak koi bhi mantri yaa iees yaa ipies adhikari jail gaya
 This happens because if someone wants to take strong action, the government stops it
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bhrashtachar ke niyantran ke liye jimmedaar agenciyaan, jo sarkaar ke adheen hai, yadi lokapal ke adheen le aayi jaae to bhrashtachari jail jaaengehi vajah he ki ham is tarah ke lokapal kii maang kar rahe hai
 The Gandhian leader, citing the Right to Information Act, said that this law has brought a drastic change and that the government will have to follow the rules and the UK has given the 'rules only for the people and control government' system
 Will go
 unhone kaha, ‘aaj desh main bhrashtachar ne apana sir uthaa liya he uske do kaaran hai
 First, the laws are so weak that corrupt persons have no fear of them
 doosraa, sarkaar chalaane vaale bahut se log in bhrasht logon kaa saath le rahe hai
 "there is also a third reason that there was no decentralization of power," Hazare said
 bhrashtachar apana sir isliye uthaata he kyonki satta sarkaar main kendrit he
 The Lokpal Bill (of power) is for decentralization and our movement is for that
 ’hajaare ke saath manch par baithe saamaajik kaaryakarta swami agnivesh samaadhaan ke prati ashanvit najar aae
 Agnivesh said, 'I don't want to see it as a confrontation
 bilkul hi nahin
 Sibal is a very reconciled person and has spoken to me over the phone and he wants to resolve the matter as soon as possible
 ummid he ki shaam tak maamla sulajh jayega
 Sibal said that the government is ready to listen to his words
 kejariwal ne andolan main kisi bhi tarah kii do-faad kii khabaron kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki isamen hissaa lene vaale log ekajute hai
 Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi also said that she is fully with this movement and she will continue to be in this struggle even further

 congress ke varisht netaa oman chandi kaa kerala kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he, kyonki pradesh congress adhyaksh ramesh chennithalaa sheersh pad kii daud se hat gaye hai
 In a meeting of senior party leaders held at the Kerala Pradesh Congress headquarters, it was unanimously decided that Chandy would lead the United Democratic Front (UDF) government
 congress vidhayak dal kii ravivaar ko baithak hone vaali he, jisamen dal ke netaa ke bare main aadhikarik ghoshnaa party ke paryvekshak mohasina kidawai or madhusudan mistre karenge
 Party sources said that Chandy has been elected for the 10th consecutive time from Puthupalli seat in Kottayam district
 vah congress ke sahyogi dalon ke kuch netaaon ke saath milakar is saptaah sarkaar banaaenge
 Although Chennithala had earlier indicated that he was interested in the top position, Chandy's seniority, his administrative experience and his ability to run the alliance made him the unanimous choice
 samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main chennithalaa ne kaha ki vah sarkaar main shaamil nahin honge, lekin bataur kerala pradesh congress adhyaksh party ko majboot dene or use ekajute banaaye rakhane par dhyaan kendrit karenge
 Chennithala, who won from Harippad, said, i think Oman Chandy should be elected unanimously as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party meeting
 is pad ke liye koi chunaav nahin hoga
 The 67-year-old former chief minister is also a trusted leader of the Front's allies
 sarkaar chalaane ke liye morche ke sahyogi kaaphi ahm hai, kyonki use 140 sadasyeey vidhansabha main aadhi se mahaj do hi siten adhik mili hai
 The Congress Legislature Party will be followed by a meeting of UDF leaders, in which the Congress leader will be formally accepted as the main leader of the coalition
 is gathbandhan ko 72 siten mili hai or usne 68 siten jeetne vaale ldf ko satta se baahar kar diya he
 The cabinet will be expanded later after discussions with allies regarding the number of ministerial posts and the division of departments
 kaaphi kam antar se bahumat hasil karne ke chalate congress nit morche ko tikaoo or prabhavi chhavi pradaan karnaa mahatvapurn he
 Therefore, the thinking in the UDF is that it would not be prudent to delay the formation of the cabinet

 Eminent historian and author Ramachandra Guha has said that India has a continuous political tradition of high level of original thinking and has touched every aspect of the human condition but has done much to restore it and make it relevant in context from today
 need to go
 guha ne kaha, ‘bharat mul raajnneeti or pratibimbit chintanashiltaa kii lambii parampara ke maamle main anokhaa desh ho saktaa he jo hameshaa ucch str kii rahi he or maanav kii sthiti ke har pahalu ko chhua he
 In his address in the fourth Penguin India lecture on 'indian political tradition-and those who laid its foundation' here last night, he said that the credit for the concept of Vishal India goes to the men and women who laid the foundation of the Indian political tradition
 And watered it
 vyaakhyaan kaa yah vishay guha kii nayi pustak ‘aadhunik bharat ke nirmaataa’ par aadhaarit tha
 Like his book, Guha started with social reformer Rajamohan Roy and described him as India's first modern and liberal who was a thinker, social actor, scholar and social reformer who faced a radical and rigid social structure from Western ideology
 guha ne kaha ki aaj ke vipareet bhartiya raajnneetik parampara ke nirmaataaon ke paas loktantr, rashtrawaad, aarthik niti, dharm, ling, jati, paryaavaran or vishwa ke saath bharat ke sambandh ke bare main kehane ke liye mul, prabhaavshaalee or praasangik chijen thim
 Giving the example of Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Jayaprakash Narayan, MS Golwalkar and Ram Manohar Lohia, he said, 'no politician or social reformer of India's political society thinks like him anymore
 hamen jis baat ko lekar chintaa karne kii jarurat he vah yah nahin ki hamaare paas chintansheel rajaneta nahin he balki aaj ke netaa apane ko jiskaa anuyaayi hone kaa daawa karte hai lekin unhen unke bare main hi maaloom nahin he
 The historian asked questions whether Congress MP Rahul Gandhi ever read letters written by Jawaharlal Nehru to Chief Ministers, did Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati ever read Ambedkar's speeches or did Samajwadi Party Mulayam Singh Yadav write a book written by Lohia Read
 unhone kaha ki vishwa ke kai anya netaaon kaa bhi yahi haal he
 However, he praised US President Barack Obama in this matter
 guha ne kaha, gandhi or nehru ne logon kii soch se bhinn apni vichaardhaara se unka saamana kiya or unhone badi mukharata se apni baat unke samaksh rakhi
 The secret of sensational assassination of NIA, National Investigative Agency, KDSP Tanzil Ahmed has been revealed
 tanzeel ahamed ke katl ke peeche naa to kisi aatankwaadi yaa aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa haath tha or naa hi unke peshey yaa peshey se jude kisi cese kii tafteesh se iskaa koi lenaa-dena tha
 Rather Tanzil Ahmed's murder is due to hostility, money and property from relatives
 unka katl unke apane hi logon ne kiya
 One DSP of NIA is shot 24 bullets
 subah hote-hote puure desh main khabar aag kii tarah fail jaati he
 The number of mouths
 koi is murder ko aatankwaadi ghatana se jodta he to koi teror group ke kisi or modul se
 Someone says that since Tanjil was behind the network of terrorists, that is the revenge
 to kisi kaa kahana tha ki tanzeel enie main bahut hi khufia mishan par the or shaayad usee kii vajah se unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 But all things just came out
 sach kuch or hi niklaa
 What is the connection of cash van robbery? There is a similar charge against Tanjil Ahmed for all the charges, which the police are neither denying nor accepting
 or ye sangeen iljaam ye he ki jis munir ne tanzeel ahamed cogoli mariusi munir ne chaar maheene pehle ek bank ke cash vine se 91 lakh rupye luute the
 Did Tanjil have anything to do with that amount of loot? According to the IG, investigations are still on regarding the amount of the robbery
 police kii giraft se dur he asal gunahagaarenie, aties, estf, local police sab mil kar ek saath kai dinon tak maathapai karte rahe
 Rinsed every angle par aakhir main sach yahi saamne aayaa he
 But is the truth complete? Or is the police still telling half the truth and half hiding it? Police have arrested two people in connection with the murder of DSP Tanjil Ahmed
 reyaan or jaini
 Both of them have told the whole story of the murder and the purpose of the murder so far
 inhen kii kahani sunne ke baad police ne media ko apni kahani sunai
 But thirdly related to this murder, rather say that the most important character i
e
 Munir is still away from the police
 munir yani 91 lakh rupye kii lut kaa mastermind
 So will the rest of the half-story unfold only after Munir? Shot so many bullets that they don't get a chance to escape
 According to the police, DSP Tanjil Ahmed's murder has two important characters
 ek reyaan or doosraa munir
 Ryan was riding a bike the night of the murders
 jabaki bike ke peeche baithe munir ne tanzeel ahamed ko bilkul kareeb se 24 goliyaan maarin
 Tanjil Ahmed was Ryan's uncle's brother-in-law
 darasal khandaan ke bich nafrat or dushmani kii shuruuaat tanzeel ahamed or reyaan ke rishton se hi shuru hui
 And the reason was money and property
 enie ke dspi mohammad tanzeel ahamed kaa katl jis sansanikhej tareeke se hua vaisaa kam hi dekhne ko miltaa he
 a murder in which the enemy not only chased his prey for a long time but also shot so many bullets at the same time that there was no scope to escape
 tanzeel kii patni ko bhi maari goli, aspataal main he bharteedo or 3 april kii raat ko bijanour main enie ke dspi mohammad tanzeel apane parivaar ke saath ek shaadi se waapas laut rahe the
 Then Ryan and Munir, riding on the bike, overtook their car in the middle of the road and blocked their way and started shooting indiscriminately
 goli tanzeel ke alaava unki bivi ko bhi lagi jo abhi bhi aspataal main behad gabhir haalat main bhartee hai
 Eyewitness to this murder Tanjil also had two children who were in the car at that time
 is hiprophile murder cese kaa pehla suraag police ko 9 mem kii us pistal se mila jisase tanzeel ahamed ko goli maari gai thi
 The IG said that after investigation in Lucknow forensics, it has become clear that the khoya used in robbery and murder was the same
 isi ke baad saaf ho gaya tha ki tanzeel ke katl se aatankavadi network yaa unke peshey kaa koi rishta nahin he
 Rather it is the result of mutual enmity
 kyonki tab tak police tanzeel ke rishtedaar reyaan ko uthaa chuki thi or wo sab kuch bataa chukaa tha
 The reason for the murder
 katl ke peeche ye tha maksadatanjil ahamed reyaan ke chachaa ke bahanoi the
 Ryan's aunt and aunt had a fight with a neighbor in Ranjit Nagar, Delhi
 police main mukadmaa darj hone ke baad unhone tanzeel se madad maangi
 Tanjil Ahmed did not help, due to which Bua and Fufa remained in jail for two days
 okhla main reyaan ke chachaa kaa chaar manjila makaan tanzeel ahamed ne liya 
 Gave a shop instead of a house
 par dukaan kii keemat makaan se sasti thi
 One crore rupees of Ryan's father's cousin was caught with a property dealer
 is maamle main bhi tanzeel se madad maangi
 But Tanjil instead of helping, got his Mamer brother to partner with the same property dealer
 reyaan kii buaa par tanzeel ne mobile chori kaa iljaam lagaaya
 Ryan was angry with Tanjil for all these things
 ye to rahi reyaan kii tanzeel ahamed se naaraazgi kii vajah
 According to the police, it was Ryan who incited Munir against Kotanjil and after that a plan was made to remove Tanjil from the road
 par sawaal ye he ki munir tanzeel se kyon naaraaz tha? tanzeel kaa us munir se kya rishta tha jisaki 2013 se hi police ko talash thi? to munir kii tanzeel ahamed se naaraazgi kii vajah kuch or thi
 UP Police reveals another sensational disclosure of the murder of DSP Tanjil Ahmed
 or wo ye ki tanzeel ahamed 2013 se wanted bhagode apradhi munir ke saath naa sirf sampark main the balki uske saath mil kar muradabad main dukaan bhi lee or praparty kaa bijness bhi karne ja rahe the
 But then how did Munir become an enemy of Tanjil Ahmed? Tanjil and Munirmunir from the same village belong to the same Sahaspur village of UP where Tanjil Ahmed was
 aligarh musslim uniwarsity ke hostal main avaidh rup se thaharne ke maamle main munir par pehla cese darj hua tha
 The police was looking for him since then
 iske baad chote-mote kai jurm karet hue uske naam sabase bada jurm pichley saal disambar main tab darj hua jab usne bank ke cash vine se 91 lakh rupye luute or do logon ko goli maar di
 These are the specific reasons for the displeasure of Munir's police Tanjil - Munir looted 91 lakh from the cash van of Punjab National Bank in Dhampur on 28 December 2015 - since this robbery, Tanjil was looking for Munir
 Munir suspected that Tanjil was informing him - though the police had been looking for Munir since 2013 - but Tanjil Ahmed was constantly in touch with Munir - together with Munir he also bought a shop in Moradabad - Munir was de It was said that Tanjil would catch him and if he was arrested for the murder of Tanjil Ahmed, then Tanjil Ahmed always insulted his family
 or bas isiilie usne unhen maar daalaa

 Both of them are mps, so the police has asked for permission to interrogate them

 ’narendra modi mazdooron ke bhakshakudhar bhartiya communist party maale ne bhi modi par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki narendra modi ko bhale hi bijepi apane pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kare lekin vah apane shasit pradesh main corporate jagat ke sangrakshak or mazdooron ke bhakshak sabit hue hai
 Swapan Mukherjee, a member of the Central Committee of CPI Male, said this in a press conference on the occasion of the 9th General Assembly of CPI Male in Ranchi starting on Tuesday
 upi-uttarakhand sahit goa or manipur main bijepi ke haathon maat khaane ke baad ab congress is saal ke aakhir main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye khaasi satark ho gai he
 The Congress is particularly focused on Gujarat, where the situation seems to be very favorable
 party agar yahaan bijepi kii 20 saal se chali aa rahi satta ko khatm karne main kaamyaab hoti he to na sirf ek bada rajya uske haath aayega balki piem modi ke griharajya main jeet puure desh main bhi uske paksh main ek bada sandesh dene kaa kaam karegi
 11th visit in 10 months, what is the reason for Modi going to Gujarat again and again? If you look at the recent political ground of Gujarat, then there is little hope for Congress
 sawaal ye he ki kya congress in halke jhonkon ko jod kuccha ke ran main raajnneetik tufaan khadaa kar paaegi
 The answer to this question will depend on how well the Congress is able to overcome the challenges facing it and how much it can capitalize on the opportunities being created in its favor
 'baagi' waghela kaa saath na chute'baapu' ke naam se jane jane vaale shankar singh waghela pichley do dashak se gujarat main congress kaa cheharaa hai or har chunaav se pehle unke baagi hone kii khabar aati he
 This time too, Shankar Singh Vaghela has shown his attitude
 twitor par unhone rahul gandhi se lekar tamaam chote-bade congress netaaon ko anfolo kar diya he
 There were also reports that Shankar Singh Vaghela had met BJP President Amit Shah
 mana ja rahaa he ki waghela is baar bhi mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bananaa chaahate hai, jabaki unhen bharat singh solanki gut se kadi takkar mil rahi he
 Solanki is the chairman of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee since December 2015
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye waghela or solanki ke bich talavaarein khinchi hui hai
 This battle is so big that the Congress had to replace Gurudas Kamat and put Ashok Gehlot in charge of Gujarat
 iske baad gurudas kaamat ne party hi chhod di
 The Congress does not want Shankar Singh Vaghela to leave the party and join the BJP before the assembly elections
 pichley 20 saal se waghela gujarat main congress kaa cheharaa hai, lekin party majboot hone kii bajaay haashiye par chali gai
 Bharat Singh Solanki faction alleges that Shankar Singh Vaghela is responsible for this situation, but the Congress top leadership is in the mood to take both Vaghela and Solanki together
 jin darbari thakuron ke samudaay se shankar singh waghela aate hai, unka vot congress nahin ganvaana chaahati
 In such a situation it has become necessary for him to stop Vaghela
 PM modi ke gujarat daure ke virodh main hardik patel ne karaayaa mundancongress se haath mila sakate hai hardik patel!aarakshan kii maang ko lekar narendra modi or bijepi ke khilaaf gujarat main morcha kholane vaale hardik patel congress ke liye madadgaar ho sakate hai
 Patel has generally been considered a BJP voter, but there is a possibility of a breakdown of Patel votes after the rise of Hardik Patel
 haalanki hardik patel kaa naam isse pehle nitish kumaar, shivasena or aam aadmi party ke saath bhi judaa lekin ab patel ne kaha he ki agar congress patidaaron ko aarakshan dene kaa vaada karti he, to ve congress ko samarthan de sakate hai
 According to Congress insiders, he has also met Prashant Kishore and Youth Congress President Raja Brar
 vipakshi partiyon ke saath talmail badhaane main lagi he congrescongress ko is baat kaa ehsaas he ki gujarat main vipaksh ko jode bina jeet paanaa mushkil he
 Therefore, every small and big party is trying to join together
 jediu or ensipi ke saath-saath sapa or basapa jaisi partiyon ke saath congress sampark main he
 So that one vote each against the BJP government in Gujarat can be saved from shattering
 pichley chunaav main dekha gaya he ki choti partiyaan bhale hi siten na jeet paaen lekin ve bijepi virdohi voton main sendhamari jarur kar detii hai
 This time, with the increasing strength of the BJP across the country, the way opposition parties are nervous, it seems more likely that they will not hesitate to unite in Gujarat to stop it
 dalit+muslim+patidaar kaa samikarnauna cond ke baad daliton main bijepi sarkaar ko lekar naaraazgi jagajaahir he

 At the same time, the Congress may also get the support of the Patidars after coming together with Hardik Patel, the Congress is already getting minority votes
 yani dalit-muslim-patidaar kaa gathjod congress ke paksh main lamaband hota he to uskaa satta kaa bees saal kaa vanvaas dur ho saktaa he
 Anti-incumbency is against BJP BJP has been in power in Gujarat for the last 20 years
 jaahir he ki uske khilaaf anti inkambasi he or vipakshi congress ke saamne use bhunaane kii chunauti bhi he
 After Narendra modi-amit Shah's arrival in Delhi, Gujarat is in turmoil in BJP
 party ke paas rajya main aisa koi cheharaa nahin he jiskaa apane ilaake se baahar puure rajya main janaadhar ho
 Apart from this, the party is also divided into different camps of leaders like Anandiben Patel, Vijay Rupani, Nitin Patel, which the BJP may have to pay in the elections

 gauratlab he ki maujuuda governrurjit patelne sitambar 2016 main raghuram rajan se kendriya bank kii kaman apane haath main lee thi

 On Tuesday, on the day of the 142nd birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Patel, the government staff gave full force to make 'run for Unity' successful on Tuesday
 centre sarkaar kii ore se kaarykram kaa prachaar prasar pehle se hi khub kiya gaya tha
 For this reason, there was a lot of enthusiasm among the youth to be a part of 'run for Unity' on 'unity Day'
 lekin ye aayojan kuch chaatraon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaya jo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke ‘shreshth bharat’ kaa hissaa banane ai thim
 On Tuesday, 14-year-old Smriti (name changed) reached India Gate in the morning with her Kabbadi team
 haalanki unke liye paas hi sthit dhyanchand stadium main practice ke liye aada roj kaa niyam he lekin 31 oktober kii taarikh ke liye unke khaas myne the
 One is the eagerness to participate in the event to show solidarity on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the first Home Minister of the country, as well as the pleasure of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bacchiyaan umang se bhari thim ki pradhanmantri ke ‘shreshth bharat’ko lekar unhen or jaanane ko milegaa
 After all that time has also come
 ek taraf piem modi manch par khadey sabakaa abhinandan kar rahe the or duusari taraf logon kaa hujum saamne se guzar rahaa tha
 In the non-stop commentary on the mic, jokes like 'sama Bandha' with words like 'heart emperor', 'everybody's favorite' for the Prime Minister were also being used
 piem haath hilaate hue muskuraate or log donon haath uthaa kar harsh vyakt karte
 Everyone was seen capturing these moments on their mobile camera
 sab kuch tha, lekin piem se rou-ba-rou hone kii ummid dil main lekar ain smriti or uski team kii anya saathi bheed main kahin gum thi
 Behind all the frills of 'unity Day', one truth remained hidden which will make anyone sad
 smriti or uski saheliyaan puure aayojan ke dauraan dhakkamukki kaa hi saamana karti raheen
 Had this thing stopped, it would have been a privilege
 suniye desh kii ek beti kii aapbeetee usee kii jubaani
 Smriti and her team got emotional when asked where they were all during the event
 saath hi boli- ' hamen bahut niraashaa hui, yahaan ladke itani hooting kar rahe the ki ham bataa nahin sakate
 While sitting, we were throwing water bottles at us and sometimes we were commenting
 'isi bich team kii sabase choti sadsy diya (badla hua naam) boli- 'ham maidan main baithe the, vahaan ladke budtameezi kar rahe the
 Sometimes we were pulling our hair, sometimes tearing the leaflets printed on Sardar Patel and throwing it at us
 vahaan maujuud guard bhi hamase itani dhkka mukki kar rahe the ham kisase kehete? hamen bahut kharaab laga
 'this complaint of Smriti and Diya was about the behavior happening at the place where the country's top government staff was engaged in making the program successful
 ekta ke utsav main bhagidaari ke liye ye betiyaan ghar se bade utsaah ke saath nikaleen thi lekin vahaan kaa haal dekh sihar kar rah gayi
 The dream of Sapna (changed name) was broken
 sapana ne bataaya,‘auron ne manaa kiya to bhi ham daudane nikle the ki ekta diwas kaa hissaa banenge
 But there was so much dirt and people were forcing their hands, it happened not only with my friends, so we had to leave the race and come back
 '‘beti bachaao, beti padhaao’ kaa naaraa to bahut jorshor se diya jaataa he, lekin mangalvaar ko in bacchiyon ko jo bhugatna padaa, kya wo ‘shreshth bharat’kii kalpana se kisi tarah bhi mail khaataa he
 The question is also for the whole society
 jab itane hiprophile kaarykram membeciyon jo man main soch kar ai thim,wo puraa hona to dur, badasluki ke chalate sahanaa bahut kuch pad gaya
 Now, imagine how safe it would be for girls to go home alone in remote areas, in low light areas? Unless the girls are assured of complete security, how can these girls fly on the open sky of golden hope? How can the picture of 'shreshtha Bharat' be realized only when these girls are away from the stage, beyond the camera lens , Crossing paper lines to get free and secure canvas

 However, on 16 December 1995, during a social movement, PAC was shot and taken to Lucknow Jail
 jail pahunchate hi unhone tay kar liya ki ab sirf samaaj seva kerani he
 After returning from prison, Phule spoke to his father and called the in-laws to express his wish

 lekin raajnneeti vigyaan main post graduate phule kii raajnneeti main aane kii kahani bhi unki nijee jindagi kii tarah hi hilaa dene vaali he
 She says, "when i passed the eighth grade, i got Rs 480 from the government scheme
 kaa wajipha mila tha, jise skool ke principal or shikshak ne jabaran apane paas rakh liya
 i protested and said that i have studied so i should get the stipend from the government
 is par skool se meraa naam kaat diya gaya or teen saal ghar bitha diya
 My politics started there
 '' raajnneeti main aane se pehle samaaj seva se judin phule ke pita railway main naukari karte hai
 Phule's political career began in 2001 when she was first elected to the Bahraich District Panchayat
 uske baad ve 2005 or 2010 main bhi is pad ke liye chuni gayi
 He was on a BJP ticket in the 2012 assembly elections in Balha (su
 ) seat se chunaav jitkar pehali baar vidhayak or 2014 main pehali baar saansad bani hai
 Although she contested from Charada assembly seat in 2007, she lost by 1,070 votes

 He says, "first the mass force, then some other force matters
 '' ve bataati hai ki vah kis tarah jivan main sangharsh kar aaj loktantr ke sabase bade mandir tak pahunchi hai

 "but Phule says that he requested to fight from his birthplace Bahraich
 unki iltijaa kabool hui aage kaa; sangharsh sansad main hoga
 But she has so much confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi that she says with utmost confidence, "I am confident that Modi ji will listen to my words literally and help to overcome the problems in the region

 Eventually, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar whipped out such police officers
 rajya police mukhyalay ne ab tak 386 daagi thana prabhariyon (eschao) or inspectoron ko unke padon se hataa diya he
 There were many allegations against these officers, so they have been removed from the responsibilities of normal functioning of the police and attached to the police line
 rajya ke police mahanideshak (dijipi) gupteshwar pandey ke anusaar, yah karrwai mukhyamantri ke aadesh par kii gai he, jo police ke bare main logon kii dharna ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 The Chief Minister's message is clear - perform or move away
 in karrwai se laaparvaah afasaron ko kadi chetavanee bhi milegi
 Law and order has been the top priority for Nitish Kumar
 unhone sakht lahaze main ek baar phir se jataa diya he ki aparaadh ke khilaaf koi rahamadili nahin hogi
 The recent efforts he has made towards police reforms are not limited to punishing policemen who do not perform well in the work
 15 agast se, bihar police ke paas ek dwibhajit bal banane kii baat kahi gai he, jisamen jaanch kaaryon or kanoon vyavastha sanbhaalane kii jimmedaari alag-alag ikaayiyon kii hogi
 DGP Pandey confirmed that each of the 1,060 police stations in Bihar would have a separate group of policemen to look into the investigation and law and order
 jaanch wing ke prabharee adhikari spidi trial sunishchit karne or duusari baar aparaadh karne waalon kii jamaanat radd karaane ke alaava, aapraadhik maamalon kii jaanch ke liye bhi jimmedaar honge
 Law and order and investigation have been done separately so that the police can pay better attention to their duties
 pichley maheene vidhansabha main nitish kumaar ne kanoon-vyavastha ke morche par chizon ko behatar banane kaa sankalp doharaaya tha, ''pichley kuch varshon main 23,000 se adhik atirikt pulicekarmiyon ko niyukt karne ke baad, hamane jaanch or kanoon vyavastha ke aadhaar par police bal ko vibhajit karne ke spasht nirdesh jari kiye hai
 We have considered giving a minimum of two years of posting in any of these responsibilities
 isse unhen dhyaan kendrit karne main madad milegi
 "nitish's arguments are clear," the state has increased the various allowances of its policemen
 unhen ek maheene kaa atirikt vetan diya ja rahaa he kyonki ve lagbhag bina kisi avkaash ke kaam karte hai
 We have given a world class Police Headquarters building which has a helipad and which will remain vulnerable to earthquakes
 ab baari police kii he ki vah hamaari ummiido par puraa utarane ke liye prayaas kare
 Those who do not perform well will be punished
 jin logon ne teen baar vibhageeya poochtacha kaa saamana kiya ho, unhen 10 varshon tak field posting nahin milegi
 Soon after the Lok Sabha elections, Nitish has focused more on law and order
 unki party jad (you) ne na sirf 17 main se 16 loksabhaa siten jeetin, balki 2015 ke vidhansabha pradarshan ke mukaable uskaa vot pratishat lagbhag 39 fisad bad gaya he
 In the reviews of the police performance immediately after the election results, Nitish has 1 pending in the police stations of the state
 4 lakh aapraadhik maamalon par gahari naaraazgi jataai thi
 He had also asked why facilities have improved manifold since he took over in November 2005, yet why criminal incidents are not being controlled
 iske saath hi police main bade paimaane par bhartiyon ko bhi manjuuri di gai he
 a recruitment drive for the appointment of 24,000 constables, 4,500 sub-inspectors and 2,000 drivers will be started soon

 Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has withdrawn the controversial order of former railway minister Lalu Prasad, in which former railway ministers, along with three colleagues and an attendant, were allowed free travel in the air-conditioned category in railways
 rail mantri mamata banerjee dwaara liye gayi faisle ke mutabik koi bhi purv rail mantri sirf do asi first class kaa jivan paryant manarth paas kii suvidha kaa laabh uthaa sakengen
 The former railway minister had the facility of complimentary first class air-conditioned passes for himself and one of his colleagues
 lalu ne rail mantri pad se jate jate ise badhaakar kul paanch kar diya tha
 This meant that apart from the former railway minister, three associates could travel with him in AC First and one attendant could travel in AC second
 19 may 2009 ke lalu prasad ke is faisle par purv rail mantri ram nayak ne aapatti uthaai thi
 He had written a letter to Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee, terming it as wrong and unfair
 baad main mamata ne kaha tha ki vah nike kii baat se sahamat he
 Owaisi said - BJP government will give citizenship to non-muslims through the bill
 This list of NRC has exposed the myth of illegal migrant But the target is ovaisi kaa kahana he ki ab bijepi naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ke jariye gaiyr muslimon ko naagarikta de sakati he
 That is, Owaisi feels that among the 19 lakh people who could not come in the NRC register, the rest can be given citizenship from the back door except Muslims
 udhar, eaiudief ke netaa aminul islam ne kaha he ki bijepi kaa agenda assam main hindu muslim raajnneeti karnaa he
 Owaisi said, "the Home Minister said in his speech that there are 4 million infiltrators
 kya wo ab bhi apane bayaan par kaayam rahenge
 Secondly, in 1997, Indrajit Gupta said that there are 4 million infiltrators
 teesri baat, 1998 main esake sinha ne kaha tha ki in avaidh pravaasiyon ke kaaran rajya ke kai jile muslim bahulya ho jaaenge
 'myth of illegal migrant busted', Owaisi said, however, this list of NRC has exposed the myth of illegal migrant
 yahi kaaran he ki bhaajapa enarasi ke bare main shikaayat nahin kar rahi he
 He told some of the 19 lakh people that his father's name is included in NRC but not of children
 mujhe ummid he ki videshi tribunel nyaaypurna tareeke se kaary karegaa
 Owaisi said that i am confident that people will apply and the number will be reduced
 ham is baat se sahamat hai ki yah bahut badi sankhya he lekin videshi nyaayaadhikaran ko vivekpurna tareeke se kaam karnaa chahie
 Owaisi has condemned the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders for not accepting the NRC
 unhone kaha ki hemanth biswa kaa bayaan nindaneey he
 This process was completed by the supervision of the Supreme Court, then why are they trying to open their Supreme Court
 'wo sabhi gaiyr-musalamaanon ko naagarikta denge'ovaisi ne kaha ki mujhe bhaajapa par andeh he ki ve naagarik sanshodhan vidheyak lekar aaenge, jisamen ve sabhi gaiyr-musalamaanon ko naagarikta denge
 Owaisi said that my complaint is for the people who voted for the BJP because they had voted for it
 unhen yah samajhnaa chahie ki bazaar main naukariyaan nahin hai
 Biscuits are not selling
 sabun kam keemton par beche ja rahe hai
 Everything in the economy is going down

 Bilaspur Vidhan Sabha seat, which is considered one of the largest cities in Chhattisgarh and the state's high profile seat, has always been the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 yahaan se bijepi vidhayanmar agarwalrajya sarkaar main kaddavar mantri hai or kareeb chaar baar yahaan sechunavjit chuke hai
 Amar Aggarwal's status can be gauged from the fact that there is a competition from Congress for those contesting against him
 kya kahata he itihaas
 
 
 Since the formation of Chhattisgarh, this seat has proved to be a stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 raman sarkaar main mantri amar agarwal pichley kareeb 15 saalon se yahaan se vidhayak chune ja rahe hai
 And stopping his victory chariot seems difficult every time
 is baar bhi amar agarwal ko congress ke hi ummidavaaron se takkar mil sakati he
 However, it also has to be seen how big a difference Ajit Jogi's party candidates can make
 2013 vidhansabha chunatomar agarwal, bijepi, kul vot mili 72255vaani raav, congress, kul vot mili 566562008 vidhansabha chunatomar agarwal, bijepi, kul vot mili 60784anil taah, congress, kul vot mili 514082003 vidhansabha chunatomar agarwal, bijepi, kul vot mili 61154anil taah, congress, kul vot mili 55311bilaspur ke bare main
 
 
 Bilaspur is considered the largest and developed city in the state after Raipur
 yahaan par aadhunik suvidhaon ke saath-saath hoicourt main bhi he jo shahar kii shaan badhaata he
 However, there are many problems that local citizens are troubled by
 udhaaharan ke taur par sivarej kaa kaam, jo abhi lagbhag 50 fisadi hi hua he
 Demand for sewerage has been one of the main demands of the citizens here, although work has started but the pace of work remains a matter of people's problem
 iske alaava bilaspur ke paas hi bahane vaali arapa nadi kaa khatm hona yahaan kii pramukh samasyaon main se ek rahaa he
 Local citizens have done satyagrahas, agitations to save the Arpa river many times, but it seems to have not been affected yet
 chhattisgarh ke bare main
 
 
 Let us tell you that there are total 90 assembly seats in Chhattisgarh
 rajya main abhi kul 11 loksabhaa or 5 rajyasabha kii siten hai
 There are a total of 27 districts in Chhattisgarh
 rajya main kul 51 siten saamaanya, 10 siten essi or 29 siten asti ke liye arakshit hai
 What were the results in the 2013 election
 
 
 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 8 disambar ko ghoshit kiye gaye the
 Among them, the Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government by defeating the Congress for the third consecutive time in the state
 raman singhki aguwai main bijepi ko 2013 main kul 49 vidhansabha siton par jeet mili thi
 While the Congress was able to win only 39 seats
 jabaki 2 siten anya ke naam gai thim
 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority
 raman singh 2003 se rajya ke mukhyamantri hai
 My initial memories of watching movies in the theater are not good
 maine pehali film pyaar kaa mausam dekhi thi
 Mere Chacha Nasir Hussain made this film in 1969 with Shashi Kapoor
 us samay main 4 saal kaa tha
 In this, my brother Faisal played the childhood role of Shashi Kapoor
 film ke ek drishy main ghar main aag lag jaati he or faisal uske bheetar funs jate hai
 Seeing that scene, i started crying and my mother took me out to silence me
 duusari baar film dekhnaa bhi utana hi naatakeey rahaa
 i went to see a film by Laurel and Hardy
 aap sochate honge ki us film ko dekhte hue mujhe bahut majaa aayaa hoga, lekin aisi baat nahin thi
 In one scene, Hardy, who is in trouble, tries to climb a wall
 uski patalun phisal rahi thi jisase vah diwaar fandakar bhaag nahin paa rahaa tha
 But instead of laughing here, i could cry for Hardy
 jaisaa ki aap kalpana kar sakate hai, in dinon main apane home theatre main filmein dekhnaa pasand karata hum
 But this is not my complaint about the experience of watching cinema in India
 multiplex kranti aane se bahut kuch badal gaya he jo filmein kabhi nahin ban paatin, ve ab banaai ja rahi hai
 People like me, who are more urban in their thinking, feel comfortable working on subjects they can relate to
 saamaanya darshak varg ke liye film banane kaa dabaav ab kam ho gaya he
 But this new kind of cinema, which calms the apps of more sophisticated people, has another side
 ekal-parade ke darshakon tathaa multiplex or saamaanya logon tathaa bhadra logon ke liye banaai jane vaali filmon ke bich pehle se kahin adhik antar aa gaya he
 In such a situation, some films become successful, but most often get beaten up
 isse bhi adhik mahatvapurn baat yah he ki tikat mahange hue hai or box offis collection badha he, lekin cinema dekhne ke anand main vruddhi nahin hui he
 a lot of money is spent on more comfortable seats, soft carpets, better airconditioning, and different types of food, but no theater owner pays attention to improving the sound or picture quality
 mere jaise rachanaatmak vyakti ko, jo apni filmon ke post-production par kam-se-kam teen maheene kharch karata he, yah hatotsahit karne vaali baat lagati he
 Why can't multiplexes spend on a good projector and sound system and get them tested in at least a month? Especially because high ticket prices are not going to see a whole audience of cinema? We need low-cost theaters to reach the growing middle class in smaller cities
 inamen tamzam nahin hoga lekin sound or pikchar kii acchhee quality milegi, jahaan log saaf-suthere maahaul main filmein dekh sakenge
 This idea came to mind when i was shooting my new film Thoja on the Grant Road in the heart of Mumbai
 ham ek puraane movie theatre ke irdagird shooting kar rahe the jahaan balcony kaa tikat 15 ru
 And the stalls cost Rs 10
 tha
 My 1995 film Terror was Terror in that theater
 isaki vajah yah thi ki koi bhi vyakti vahaan nai filmein pradarshit nahin karnaa chahta
 If we build 40 such theaters in Mumbai alone and display our films in them in the first cycle, then imagine how much the audience will increase
 america main 38,000 se adhik movie screen hai jabaki bharat main lagbhag 9,000
 We need to go to remote areas of the country
 saath hi, apni filmon or apane film dekhne vaale samudaay main vruddhi kerani chahie

 Addressing the party's rally in Mandya, Karnataka, he said that because of Manmohan Singh, the UPA government passed important bills

 vipakshi partiyaan to atmasamman kii duhai dekar piem se istife kii maang karne lagi thim
 At the same time, sources had also told that the Prime Minister was angry with Rahul's rebellion, although Sonia Gandhi himself tried to handle the matter by calling himself
 isi koshish ko aage badhaate hue aaj sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, 'it is the PM that can pass such an important bill
 hamane indira or rajeev gandhi ke siddhaton kaa anusaran kiya
 We are not like BJP or other opposition parties
 ham puure lagan se janata kii seva karte hai
 On the Prime Minister's leadership, Sonia Gandhi said, "siddaramaiah's government in Karnataka is doing a good job
 vahiin centre main manmohan singh ke netritv main bhi ham aisi hi koshish kar rahe hai
 But the opposition is trying to stop us and criticize unnecessarily
 'sonia gandhi ne kaha, 'vipaksh vaale hamaari pradhanmantri kaa majaak udaate hai par hamaari party unke saath he
 Today, the entire party stands with the Prime Minister

 There are many families who want to give higher education to their daughters, also want to do jobs but after seeing the evils spread in the society, they drag their feet back
 aap chahen to ise unka dar kah sakate hai lekin ye dar se kahin adhik unki chintaa kaa parinaam hota he
 It is true that the whole society cannot change with one person coming forward
 samaaj main badlaav laane ke liye har kisi ko apane str par koshish karne kii jarurat he
 But if you also have a girl in your house and go out in connection with a job, job or any other work, then it is also important for you to take some precautions as a parent: know your time and place if your daughter is going out somewhere, You should know the time of movement but there is no need to become Hitler
 ho saktaa he ki kisi jaruri vajah se aapaki beti ko kabhi lautne main der ho jaae, is baat par useftkaarane ke bajaay pyaar se puuchhie ki use kahaan der ho gai
 Why its late aaj ke samay main jab mobile rakhana bahut aam baat ho gai he to use bhi ek mobile de den taaki der hone par wo aapako suchit kar sake
 Also, they tell you even if there is any kind of problem
 kapade bahut bhadkile na hoparty yaa phir kisi aayojan main bhadkile kapade hi achche lagate hai lekingar aapaki bitiyaa skool, college yaa offis ja rahi haito uske kapadon kaa chayan sahi hona chahie
 Clothes are good if decent
 beti ke saath dost banakar rahenye bahut jaruri he ki aap apni beti ke saath maa yaa pita kam or dost banakar zyada rahen
 So that he can tell everything directly to you
 uski baaten hi aapako uske liye sahi faisla lene yaa phir use kisi pareshaani se bachaane main madad karegi
 It is also important for you to know about the people with whom your daughter sits with
 sangati kaa asar bahut tej hota he aise main sunishchit karen ki uski sangati achche logon kii hi ho
 Not the kind of people who provoke him to do wrong things
 use spes bhi dembacchee ko uskaa spes dena bahut jaruri he
 Staying like a shadow behind him all the time can also take him away from you
 use ye bhi lag saktaa he ki aap us par bharosa nahin karte hai
 This can cause trouble for both of you
 use jaruri baaten bataaenhar abhibhavak ko apni beti ko aatmaraksha ke bare main bataanaa chahie
 There should always be some important things in your daughter's bag that will not make her feel weak
 iske alaava aajkal kai aise camp hote hai jinamein aatmaraksha ke tareeke bataae jate hai

 Senior Executive (credit Review) - Notification specialist cader officer (kantrect) -notification Specialist Cadre Officer (regular) - Notification specialist cader officer (regular / kantrect) -notification Leader of the Opposition met President Ram Nath Kovind seeking a fair probe into the death of CBI Judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya
 vipakshi netaaon ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii aguai main isse sambandhit gyaapan bhi raashtrapati ko saunpa
 The opposition demands that the case be investigated by the SIT (special Investigation Team) headed by the sitting Supreme Court judge
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, kapil sibbal, gulam nabi aaazaad, anand sharma, pi chidambaram, sipiem ke di raja, tiemasi ke idrish ali, manish gupta, sanjay singh or bajruddin ajmal jaj loya maut kii jaanch se judaa gyaapan saunpane shuukravaar kii shaam raashtrapati bhawan pahunche
 The opposition did not trust the CBI
 Rahul Gandhi said that the memorandum submitted to the President has been signed by about 115 mps and 15 political parties
 kai saansadon ko shaq he kyonki jaj loya kii maut sandigdh paristhitiyon main hui
 At the same time, Kapil Sibal said that he does not trust the CBI, so a SIT investigation has been demanded
 gauratlab he ki vipakshi partiyanjaj loya kii maut parapahale hi nishpaksh jaanch kii maang kar chuki hai
 Rahul Gandhi also spoke to the media after questions raised on this issue by four judges of the Supreme Court
 unhone tab apil kii thi ki chaaron jajon ke aarope behad ahm he
 Judge Loya case should be properly investigated
 rahul ne kaha tha ki supreme court ke sheersh str par jaj loya ke maamle kii jaanch honi chahie, jo hamaara legal system he, us par ham vishwaas karte hai
 a serious matter has arisen, so we are talking about this
 supreme court menis maamle kii sunwaayee chif justise deepak mishra kii aguai vaali bench kar rahi he
 In the previous hearing, the CJI said that it would only hear the case related to the death of Judge Loya
 usase jude kisi anya mudde par sunwaayee nahin karenge
 The Supreme Court had asked all the petitions related to this case to be transferred to them by the High Court
 kya he puraa maamla?bataa den ki justise loya bahucharchit soharabuddin shaikh maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 In 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar were abducted by the Gujarat Police and were killed in an alleged encounter in Hyderabad
 soharabuddin muthbhed ke gavaah tulsiram kii bhi maut ho gai thi
 BJP president Amit Shah was also named in this case
 maamle se jude trial ko supreme court ne maharashtra main transfar kiya tha
 Earlier, another judge was hearing the matter, but he expressed displeasure over the non-appearance of BJP President Amit Shah in the matter, after which he was transferred
 phir justise loya ke paas is maamle kii sunwaayee ai
 In December 2014, Justice Loya died in Nagpur, which was considered a suspect
 justise loya kii maut ke baad jis jaj ne is maamle kii sunwaayee kii, unhone amit shah ko maamle main bari kar diya tha
 Recently, a magazine claimed in its report that Justice Loya's death was not simple but suspicious
 jiske baad se hi yah maamla dobaaraa charchaa main aayaa
 Political rhetoric has also continued on this issue
 haalanki, jaj loya ke bete anuj loya ne kuch din pehle hi press conference kar is mudde ko bada karne par naaraazgi jataai thi
 Anuj had said that his father's death was natural, he does not want to promote the issue
 amit shah bhi de chuke hai javabagenda ajtak 2017 ke manch par amit shah ne is mudde par puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki kaaravaan megsine ne justise loya kii maut ko lekar khabar chhaapi, to duusari ore ek angreji akhbaar ne bhi khabar chhaapi
 Whoever suspects, see the facts
 kya ye unke khilaaf koi raajnneetik shadyantr he? is sawaal par amit shah ne kaha ki main aisa kuch nahin kahana chahta
 Why should i get upset? Whoever suspects, go and see Nagpur
 sadhu-santon ke 13 pramukh akhaadon kii sanstha akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad ne madhyapradesh kii dharmik nagari ujjain main 22 april se shuru hone vaale sinhasth meley main hissedari ke liye navgathit kinnar akhaade ko manyata dene se inkaar kar diya he
 But in spite of this, the Kinnar Akhara stands firm on the Hindus to participate in this important religious gathering and they say that they do not need the recognition of the Akhara Council
 desh kii mashhoor kinnar lakshminarayan treepathi urf lakshmi bhi kinnar akhaade ke samarthan main utar aayi hai
 She joined other eunuchs in the cleanliness drive of the Kshipra River at Gandharva Ghat in Ujjain before the Simhastha fair
 kinnar akhaade ne ghoshnaa kii he ki vah maheene bhar ke dharmik meley main isi ghat par apana shahi snaan karegaa
 Before joining the Kshipra cleanliness drive, Lakshmi said, 'we did not go to seek recognition from the Akhara Council and who is this institution that will give us recognition
 kinnar to paidaaishi yogi hai
 The eunuchs have played an important role in protecting Sanatan Hinduism
 hamen kisi ke praaanpatr yaa manyata kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Furious over Akhara Parishad President Mahant Narendra Giri's recent refusal to recognize Kinnar Akhara, Laxmi said, "narendra Giri is making ruthless rhetoric
" kisi ke virodh se hamen koi fark nahin padataa
 Hamasinstha Meleki will be involved in every activity
 ’unhone kataaksh kiya, ‘kuch sant shaayad is dar se kinnar akhaade kaa virodh kar rahe hai ki tisare ling ke dharm jagat kii aguwai kii bhoomika main aane ke baad unka kya hoga
 Laxmi questioned the 13 major akharas of the sages and sages, and said, “which major scriptures of Hindus refer to the akhada method
 duusari ore, sanathan hindu dharm ke kai pavitra granthon main kinnaron kaa vishesh ullekh he
 'he said,' The existence of eunuchs has been ignored for centuries
 hamane apana khoyaa vajood hasil karne or samaaj kii mukhya dhara main shaamil hone ke liye kinnar akhaade kii sthapana kii he
 Kinnar Arena will hoist its tent at Simhastha Fair like the other 13 Akharas and hoist the flag
 iske saath hi, meley main bhajan-kirthan, nrity, aarti or yajna aadi karegaa
 The famous human rights activist of the eunuchs demanded the Madhya Pradesh government to provide all the facilities and financial assistance to the Kinnar Akhara, which it is giving to the other 13 Akharas
 unhoneujjain main kshipraa nadeemen pradooshan par chintaa bhi jataai, jiske tat par 22 april se 21 may tak sinhasth mela lagegaa
 About five crore people from all over the world are expected to attend this fair
 lakshmi ne kaha, ‘yah vidmbanapurna he ki ujjain main kshipraa nadi kii sthiti kisi naale jaisi ho gayi he
 But the administration is sleepy like Kumbhakarna
 bhartiya footbal premiyon ke liye shuukravaar 6 aktubar kaa din bahut mahatvapurn avasar hone ja rahaa he
 On this day, India's national team is going to participate in the FIFA U-17 World Cup for the first time
 do saal main ek baar hone vaale is toornament kii mejabani kar rahe bharat ne swatah hi qualiphi kar liya he
 If our young players do well in their group, they can get a chance to play with the strongest football teams — Brazil, Germany, England, France and Spain
 lekin bharat ke nausikhua khiladinnon kaa alimination round tak pahunchnaa lagbhag asambhav he
 Portuguese coach Luis Norton de Matos of the Indian team believes that the Indian team is not in a position to win a single match in this tournament
 ve kehete hai, ''mujhe is team par puraa bharosa he
 But i am also realistic
 " di matos—jo das baar belgium kii champion rahi standard lig samet kai tiimon main khel chuke hai—paanch baar portugal kii ore se khel chuke hai or unka koching kariyar unhen gini bisaau tak le ja chukaa he
 They say that India has talent but lacks experience
 is team ke khiladinnon ko kam umr main hi 2013 main goa main shuru kii gai ol india footbal federation (eiefef) ilit academy main training di gai he
 Playing against different teams, he has circled the world and prepared for the World Cup
 pratiyogita main team kaaphi sangharsh kar chuki he
 In August, he took part in a four-nation tournament in Mexico, which included teams from Colombia, Chile and India, besides hosts Mexico preparing for the World Cup
 us toornament main mexico or colombia se buree tarah pitane ke baad chile ke khilaaf 1-1 kii barabari karke bharat kii yuva team ne apana damakham dikhaaya or logon kii tarif hasil kii
 This was probably his best result so far
 isse pehle may main ''italy" par 2-0 kii jeet ne sansani paidaa kar di thi, lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki vah italy ke nichle str ke klbon main khilne vaale khiladinnon kii team thi, na ki under-17 kii rashtriya team jo kinhin kaarnon se world cap ke liye qualiphi nahin kar pai
 The draw of the World Cup to form the group has also not been kind to India
 uske group main america, colombia or ghana kii timen hai
 Colombia defeated India 3–0 in the Mexico tournament
 ghana is str par do baar world cap jeet chukaa he, donon baar 1990 ke dashak main
 Only Brazil and Nigeria have won this tournament more than that
 is bich america do baar vishwa champion rahe mexico se apane mahadweep kii pratiyogita ke final main haar chukaa he
 That is why De Matos believes that if India wins any match in his group, it will be a miracle
 di matos ne team ko koching dene kaa jimmaa march main liya tha
 Before that, Germany's Nikolai Adam had been coaching the team since 2015
 lekin is saal janvari main rus ke sharmnaak daure par khiladinnon ne jab unke upar maansik or shaareerik utpeeda kaa aarope lagaaya to unhen apane pad se hatana padaa
 In this tour, India lost 8–0 to hosts Russia in one match and suffered a humiliating defeat in other matches as well
 eiefef ke adhikari or bharat ke purv antarrashtriya khilaadi abhishek yadav ne bataaya ki di matos ne unase nae khiladinnon kii khoj karne ke liye kaha
 Yadav, who finished his career in 2011, says that he has seen more than 10,000 young players at various camps across the country for the World Cup
 kuch bhi ho lekin footbal ke premiyon ke liye bharat ke yuva khiladinnon ko world cap main khelte hue dekhne kaa yah abhootpurv mauka hoga
 The tournament is the first step towards the future of India's football and the AIFF must ensure that it attracts a large number of spectators to watch the tournament in six cities
 yuva khiladinnon ke liye apni pratibha dikhaane kaa behtareen avasar he
 The best result for India will not be to match in a match, but to impress foreign teams so much that they invite them to come where they can get both training and facilities
 gujarat ke patidaar netaa hardik patel mangalvaar ko congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi welcomed him on joining the party
 congress main shaamil hone ke baad ab hardik patel ke jamnagar loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladane kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 However, nothing has been officially cleared by the Congress as yet from which seat they can contest the Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke baad se hi aisi atakaley lagaai ja rahi thi ki hardik patel kisi bhi din congress main shaamil ho sakate hai
 According to experts, the party is likely to benefit from Hardik joining the Congress in the areas of Gujarat where the Patidars have more hold
 gauratlab he kigujarat main patidaar samudaay ke liye aarakshan kii maang ko lekar andolan kii aguwai kar chuke hardik patel ke 12 march ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii upasthiti main party main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi

 dhyaan ho ki gujarat pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa grih rajya he or congress pradesh par puraa dhyaan laga rahi he
 In the last assembly election, the party gave a tough fight to the ruling BJP
 haalanki 25 saal kehardik patel ne kuch din pehle NDTV se kaha tha ki jab tak unke paas janata kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga to party politics main jane kaa koi matlab nahin hoga
 Hardik said that he will roam all over the country and will keep opposing the wrong policies of power
 gujarat chunaav main surat ke nateezon par sawaal khadaa karne vaale hardik patel ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bhale hi congress 3 rajyon main jeet gai ho lekin iviem se chhedchhad kaa sawaal bana hua he
 Patel said that the results which have been delayed in Madhya Pradesh are again being questioned
 hardik ne kaha ki jab prime time ke vaqt kai jagah tivi par NDTV india nahin dikhataa, soshal media ke zarie bhram failaayaa ja saktaa he to aise vaqt main iviem se chhedchhad nahin ho sakati ye kaise maane? Social activist Anna Hazare says that when he recently undertook a 12-day hunger strike on the issue of 'strong' Lokpal, he never felt weak while living among the public

 Celebs do not get a chance to take time out for love because of being busy at work
 is par riect karte hue kriti ne kaha- ''nahin aisa nahin he agar pyaar ke liye vakt nahin nikaalenge to jindagi dukhabhari ho jaaegi
 One should always make time for love
 pyaar khubasurat hota he
 Love is not complex, people are

 Kathak dancer Shovna said- “I have had to face many times people thinking that how can you be a classical singer through Bihar
 sab aashcharya karte hai
 i used to wonder if i am Bihari, so i cannot be a dancer? While talking about the old times, all the classical dancers that have happened were from Bihar
 chaahe amrapali ho yaa salvati
 "shovana said- i come from a family like this, where there was no background in dancing, but still my family helped me in choosing dance as a profession
 50 ke dashak main aisa sochna badi baat thi
 But society thought the opposite
 kaise ek bihari dance ko profeshan chun saktaa he, lekin jab ek baar maine sabit kar diya to logon ne sweekaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Shovana said - There are very few people who understand the culture of Bihar
 har cheez kii do tasviren hoti hai, lekin bihar kii hameshaa buree tasviir dikhaai jaati he

 Then i saw the syllabus of NIFT, it had everything i wanted to do
 samant ne kaha- shuru main mujhe bhi is baat saamana karnaa padaa ki bihari hokar ye diziner kaise ho saktaa he
 But later when people started understanding my work, they started getting respect
 seshan main screenriter or diarector amitabh verma bhi shaamil hue
 He said- i have a lot of complaint with filmmaker Prakash Jha
 unhone hameshaa apni filmon main bihar kii buree tasviir hi dikhaai, jabaki bihar kaa ek ujala paksh bhi he
 i want to make a film, which will be a love story, but it will show the real culture of Bihar
 logon ko bihari hone par garv hoga
 Dr
 ajit pradhan ne kaha- bihar ke achche culture ke bare main bahut kam logon ko pataa he

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) ummid to yahi thi ki yogi raaj main upi kii gaayon ke liye achche din aaenge
 There were solid reasons for this hope
 yogi adityanath gaayon se agaadh prem karte hai
 350 cows have been patronized by Yogi Adityanath in the Goshala of Gorakhpur
 lakhanu ke siem awaas main bhi ab gaayon kaa baseraa he
 When the question of the cow comes, Yogi gets to see Adityanath's readiness as seen on the call of Mulayam Singh's daughter-in-law
 lekin hakeekat ye he ki yogi raaj main gaayon kaa bhavishya ujjwal nahin dikh rahaa he
 The danger of life in rearing cows: Abrar Ahmed, who retired from the army, is afraid of rearing his cow

 The family continues to live by selling cow and buffalo milk
 lekin alvar se ai khabaron ke baad inke dil kaa dar gaharaata ja rahaa he
 It is quite possible that now the seagoys will be given goodbye here and buffaloes become confident of their future

 Cows are not inferior to any problem for them
 yogi sarkaar ke liye ye report ankhen khol dene vaali he, kyonki upi kaa gaayon se rishta sirf imotional hi nahin tarakkee kaa bhi he
 For the economy of UP, it is necessary for the cows and buffaloes to be milch
 kyonki

 5
 upi chaahe to 70 fisadi mahilaon ko deyari project main rojgaar de saktaa he
 These are the figures that will make it easy for the Yogi government to understand how harmful cow protection is to the health of UP
 sawaal kisi abdul, mushtak yaa kamran kaa nahin, upi kaa he
 The strictness shown by the Yogi government on illegal slaughterhouses should also be strictly against those who commit hooliganism in the name of cow protection

 a Facebook post in Marathi has gone viral these days
 isamen logon ko chetaya ja rahaa he ki jinke paas bhartiya state bank (esbiai) ke credit or debit card hai or jin par wifi (wifai) kaa simbel bana hua he wo saavdhaan ho jaaen
 In this video post, it has been claimed that by using these cards, someone can withdraw money from your bank account because these cards do not require a PIN number
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki ye daawa puri tarah galat he
 These cards equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology or contactless cards are considered safe all over the world
 NFC chip, kam duuri tak data transfar kii ijaajat detaa he or isamen point of cell (POS) divaais ko chune kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Facebook user Harish Shetty posted a video on Facebook in which a man named Prakash Patil says in Marathi that his money was deducted only by rolling the card over the POS machine
 wo ye bhi kahata he ki is tranjection ko athoraies karne ke liye kisi PIN kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 To prove his point, Patil fills in a transaction amount of Rs 10 in the POS machine, then rolls the credit card over the POS and gets a receipt from the machine
 is video main patil ko logon se apil karte bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki ve apane card bainkon ko waapas kar den yaa block kar den jisase ki unke saath dhokhadhadi na ho sake
 This video is getting very much forward on whatsapp these days

 SBI later said that only banks have issued debit and credit cards with wifi symbols
 ye saare contactales yaa NFC yukt card hai
 Not only SBI but many banks like HDFC and ICICI have started issuing such cards
 NFC yukt card se graahak sirf POS mashin ko chhukar hi tranjection kar sakate hai, isliye graahakon ko tranjection ke dauraan apane card ko celsman ko dena nahin padataa

 For the next thirty days, yes, in the next thirty days, North Korea can do such a big blast that the world will be stunned
 ye ham nahin kah rahe
 Rather this fear is called the CIA, the strongest intelligence agency of the world's most powerful country

 But his thinking has not changed yet
 ek taraf to wo dakshin korea ke winter olympic main apni team bhejkar duniya ko dikhaa rahaa he ki wo badal gaya he
 On the other hand, he is planning a nuclear attack
 kim kii is khufia planning kaa khulaasa satellite tasveeron se hua he

 Congress leader Kapil Sibal raised several issues, once again bombarding questions on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sibbal ne aarope lagaaya ki ipel ke dinon se pradhanmantri modi or lalit modi kaafii qareeb rahe hai
 Referring to many dates, Sibal said that behind every date, many secrets are hidden
 isi ke saath unhone taarikh ginanaa shuru kiya or ek-ek kar bataaya ki us din kya hua
 The dates mentioned by Sibal are as follows: 15 sitambar 2009 Narendra Modi became the President of Gujarat Cricket Sandh, Amit Shah became the Vice President and both went to Mumbai to attend the BCCI meeting on the same day and Gujarat were given four matches of IPL
 16 sitambar 2009 Shantanu Chari of Rajasthan Royals e-mailed Lalit Modi and asked for help
 modi ne kaha, narendra modi mere kaafii qareebi hai wo madad karenge
 17 December 2009 bisisiai ne ipel main do nai tiimon ke liye tender nikaalane kaa faisalaa kiya
 Feb 2010 lalit modi gujarat gaye, amit shah or adani se mili
 Adani is a sponsor of Gujarat Cricket Association
 lalit modi ne tender main do nai shart jodin jo baad main gavarning council se paas nahin huin
 The first bidding company should have one billion dollars and be ready to deposit 460 crore bank guarantee
 7 march 2010 The remaining bidding companies objected to this
 baad main gavarning council ne tender radd kar diya
 During the meeting, there were 2 phone conversations between Lalit Modi and Amit Shah
 26 april 2010 BCCI sent show cause notice to Lalit Modi for changing the rules 10 june 2013 The inquiry committee of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin found that Modi changed the rules to benefit Videocon and Adani Group
 vahiin, sibbal ko jawaab dete hue bijepi ke netaa venkaiya naidu ne sawaal uthaae ki lalit modi maamla kab hua?, modi ko kyon desh se baahar jane diya gaya? jab modi desh se baahar gaye to us samay kiski sarkaar thi? Why was Lalit Modi allowed out of the country and no action was taken? Comments lalit modi ko madad karne ke aarope main ghiri sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje ke istife par adi vipaksh ne sansad kaa monsoon satr ek bhi din nahin chalane diya he
 In such a situation, the opposition has intensified the attack on the government due to these new allegations on the relationship between the Prime Minister and Lalit Modi
 sibbal ne kai tarikhon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki har tarikh ke peeche kai raaj chhipe hai
 With this, he started counting the dates and explained one by one what happened that day
 sibbal ne jin tarikhon kaa zikr kiya he wo is prakaar he : 15 September 2009 narendra modi gujarat cricket sandh ke adhyaksh bane, amit shah upaadhyaksh bane or donon usee din bisisiai kii baithak main shaamil hone mumbai gaye or gujarat ko ipel ke chaar match die gaye
 16 September 2009 rajasthan royles ke shantnu chaari ne lalit modi ko i-mail kar madad maangi
 Modi said, Narendra Modi is very close to me, he will help
 17 disambar 2009 The BCCI decided to put out tenders for two new teams in the IPL
 farvari 2010 Lalit Modi went to Gujarat, met Amit Shah and Adani
 adani gujarat cricket sangh ke ek sponcer hai
 Lalit Modi added two new stipulations in the tender which were not passed by the Governing Council later
 pehali boli lagane vaali company ke paas ek billian dollar ho or wo 460 karod bank guarantee jamaa karne ko taiyaar ho
 7 March 2010 baaqi boli lagane vaali companiyon ne is par aitaraaz jataayaa
 The Governing Council later canceled the tender
 miting ke dauraan 2 baar lalit modi or amit shah ke bich phone par baatcheet hui
 26 April 2010 lalit modi ko bisisiai ne niyam badalane ke liye kaaran bataao notice bheja 10 June 2013 jyotiraditya sindhiya, arun jetali or chiraayu amin kii jaanch samiti ne paaya ki modi ne videokon or adani group ko faaydaa pahunchane ke liye niyam badale
 At the same time, while answering Sibal, BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu raised the question that when the Lalit Modi case happened? Why was Modi allowed out of the country? When Modi went out of the country, whose government was that time? lalit modi ko desh se baahar jane kyon diya gaya or koi karrwai kyon nahin hui?tippaniyan The adamant opposition has not allowed the monsoon session of Parliament to run for a single day on the resignation of Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje, who were accused of helping Lalit Modi
 aise main pradhanmantri or lalit modi ke bich sambandhon par in nae aaropon se vipaksh ne sarkaar par hamalaa or tej kar diya he
 The dates mentioned by Sibal are as follows: 15 sitambar 2009 Narendra Modi became the President of Gujarat Cricket Sandh, Amit Shah became the Vice President and both went to Mumbai to attend the BCCI meeting on the same day and Gujarat were given four matches of IPL

 The Communist Party of india-marxist said on Monday that the government should cancel at least 90 controversial coal block allocations out of the total 140 coal blocks allocated and investigate this to remove the deadlock in Parliament
 makapa ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki bhartiya janata party bhi ab uski hi maang par aa gai he
 Senior CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that we have been demanding cancellation of coal blocks and their investigation
 sarkaar ko ab is disha main kadam uthaanaa chahie kyonki bhaajapa bhi uske is vichaar ke anuroop maang kar rahi he
 It may be noted that the CAG report tabled in Parliament said that due to lack of transparency in allocation of coal blocks to private companies, 1 to the exchequer
 85 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 The CAG report has not directly blamed the Prime Minister or his office, but these coal blocks were allotted (july 2004 to May 2009) when the Prime Minister was in charge of the Union Coal Ministry
 bhaajapa haalanki is masale par lagaataar pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang karti aa rahi thi
 Now it has been said on behalf of the BJP that if the allotted coal blocks are canceled and their investigation done, BJP will allow the Parliament to function

 nyaayamurti je
 Chelameswar said today that impeachment cannot be the answer to every question or problem and the system needs to be rectified
 nyaayamurti chelmeshwar ne yah bhi spasht kar diya ki vah apni sevanivritti ke baad sarkaar se koi niyukti nahin maangenge
 He said, 'I am saying in the record that after my retirement on June 22, i will not ask for any appointment from the government
 ’ ucchtam nyaayalay main pradhan nyaayadhish (sijeai) ke baad vah sabase varisht nyaayadhish hai
 Justice Chelameswar said that the press conference he held on January 12 with Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice MB Lokur and Justice Kurian Joseph was a result of anger and concern as the CJI on the issues raised by him about the functioning of the apex court The desired outcome of his discussion with the latter did not materialize
 loktantr main nyaaypalika kii bhoomika vishay par baat karte hue nyaayamurti chelmeshwar ne peethon ke gathan or vibhinn nyaayadhishon ko maamalon ke aavanton main sijeai kii praathamikta par puche gaye sawaalon kaa bhi jawaab diya
 CJI is the master of roster
 He said, 'CJI is the master of roster
 beshak, sijeai ke paas yah shakti he
 The CJI has the power to set up benches but under the constitutional system every authority has certain responsibilities with it
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya unhen lagata he ki peethon kaa gathan or maamalon kaa aavanton manamaane tareeke se nahin kiya janaa chahie, unhone iskaa sakaaratmak jawaab diya
 Talking to the judge, Karan Thapar asked whether there was sufficient basis for impeachment against CJI? In response, Justice Chelameswar said, 'why was this question asked? 'the next day someone will ask me about impeachment
 main nahin jaanata ki yah desh mahabhiyog ke bare main itnaa adhik chintit kyon he
 We (along with Justice Ranjan Gogoi) wrote in the judgment of Justice CS Karnan that apart from that there must be mechanisms to streamline the system
 ‘unhone kaha, ‘mahabhiyog har sawaal yaa har samasya kaa hal nahin ho saktaa
 This response has come in the wake of the initiation of impeachment proceedings by the opposition parties against the CJI
 gauratlab he ki desh main kisi bhi sijeai ne mahabhiyog kaa saamana nahin kiya he
 Asked whether he feared that Justice Gogoi (who was part of the letter to the CJI in November 2017) would not be promoted as the next CJI? Justice Chelameswar said he hoped that this would not happen and if it did, it would be proved that what he had said at the January 12 press conference was correct
 haalanki unhone kaha, ‘main jyotishi nahin hum 
 
 
 
 ’ unhone harvard club india dwaara yojit ek kaarykram main yah kaha
 The club consists of people who have studied at this American university and are residing here
 unhone kaha, ‘koi bhi vyakti jo saarvajanik pad par hota he kabhi bhi aalochana ko taal nahin saktaa
 Asked if the selective allocation of cases is undermining trust in the institution, he said, "I believe so and if the process is not transparent, it leads to skepticism

 Would do gujaratmen log kah rahe hai ki mahesh shah, amit shah kaa najdiki he
 In such a situation, he may also have a relationship with Modi

 Kejriwal had also alleged earlier that former Gujarat Chief Minister Suresh Mehta has said that Mahesh Shah has close ties with Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah
 aakhir iskar vibhaag mahesh shah se kisi poochtacha kar rahaa he ki koi baat saamne nahin aa rahi
 The simple question is that Modi should explain what is the relationship between him and Mahesh Shah
 mahesh shah kaa paisa aakhir kiskaa he

 Let us tell you, this slogan was chanted by Mangal Pandey to burn the fire of revolution in the hearts of slave people and soldiers and to show their desire to fight and take freedom
 ye hai duniya kii khatarnaak jhilein, leti he hajaaron jaane
 
 
 The death of April 8, 1857 was fixed for the hanging of Mangal Pandey

 JIPMER yani jawaharlal nehru institute of post graduate medical ajukeshan and research, pandicherry ke liye hui pravesh pariksha ke nattejey aa gaye hai jisamen gujarat ke arunangshu bhattacharya ne 99
 Has secured first position nationwide with 998 percentile
 arunangshu mul rup se assam ke rahane vaale hai lekin unke mata-pita gujarat ke surat main rahete hai
 In Surat itself, he took up medical preparations from Allen Institute
 NDTV ke saath apni baatcheet main unhone bataaya ki JIPMER ne apane prashnon ke str main kaaphi badlaav kiye hai
 While a few years ago, JIPMER used to have more questions related to the names of scientists in Biology or to the theory, there are more questions related to concepts like AIIMS
 biology ke sawaalon ke liye animal physiology par ab vishesh dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 The number of numericals has also increased in the question of physics
 arunangshu bataate hai ki agar aap ames kii taiyaari kar rahe hai to saath hi JIPMER kii taiyaari bhi kar sakate hai
 As far as physics is concerned, such questions are asked in it, which are based on more than one theory
 misaal ke liye mekenix kii theory kaa prayog kar duusare chapter se prashn banaae jate hai
 Similarly, in preparation of chemistry, there is no need to give any separate time for JIPMER, we can prepare this exam along with NEET
 chemistry kii taiyaari ke liye NCERT ko aadhaar maan kar chalanaa chahie
 Organic chemistry questions are somewhat difficult, but Arunangshu believes that the questions that are difficult are difficult for everyone, so their preparation should not be affected
 JIPMER ke liye angreji or mental ability par kuch adhik dhyaan dene kii jarurat nahin hoti he, mental ability ke sawaal aasaan hi rahete hai
 Similarly, if we are preparing English for our board and we have the ability to write in it, then we can easily overcome this obstacle
 arunangshu kaa kahana he ki aamtaur par logon ke man main ames or neet kaa hi dhyaan rahata he, JIPMER jaise insticute par nahin
 But students should keep in mind that this institute also comes in second-third in the country for medical studies
 agar ham isaki taiyaari bhi saath-saath karen to hamaare paas ek or vikalp rahegaa
 There is not much difference in the preparation of AIIMS and JIPMER
 ames kii tulana main JIPMER main chart or teble aadhaarit sawaal bhi adhik puche jate hai
 Arunangshu wants to specialize in neuro or cardio in future
 kevipivai (kishor vaigyanik protsahan yojana) main bhi unhone desh bhar main 26waan sthaan hasil kiya he
 At the same time, he is also going to represent the country in the Biology Olympiad to be held in Hungary

 party ke buudhvaar ke andolan ke purv samvaadadaata sammelan main gadakari ne aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ‘galat aarthik nitiyon or kushasan’ bhi mahangaai ke liye jimmedaar hai
 He said that although Pawar cannot be acquitted but the cabinet is supreme and Manmohan Singh Sonia Gandhi as its head and Finance and Commerce Minister are also responsible for common man's misdeeds
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki mahangaai ke khilaaf uske rashtravyapee andolan main agar vam yaa anya dal aage aate hai to unka swaagat he
 Asked whether the movement is only from the BJP or other NDA constituents are involved, Gadkari said, "the movement against inflation is not a political issue but a struggle for the survival of the poor
" ham vam or anya dalon ke samarthan kaa swaagat karenge
 Gadkari said that the BJP leaders visited the grain godowns in different parts of the country and saw that their condition was in chronic condition

 bijepi ke diggaj netaaon main se ek laalkrishna adwani kaa aaj 90waan janmdin he
 On this occasion, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav took birthday wishes to Advani by tweeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lalu prasad yadav ne apratyaksh rup se twit karte hue likhaa ki 'adwaniji ke janmdin par unhen hardik shubhakamanaayen, agar koi shishy baagi ho jaae to isaki chintaa kabhi mat kiijie

 Even then, while preparing the next generation of the party, Advani was isolated

 But the opposition Congress has regularly alleged that none of their advice was taken by the central government after the BJP came to power

 dilli main bekaabu bheed kaa gussa itnaa unmaadi ho gaya ki bina tasdik kiye chori ke aarope main ek yuvak kii peet petakar hatya kar di
 In Uttam Nagar area of delhi's Dwarka district, 3 people were beaten fiercely by an unruly mob on suspicion of battery theft
 jisamen ek shaks kii maut ho gai jabaki 2 log aspataal main jindagi ke liye jang lard rahe hai
 Avinash Kumar, an auto driver by profession, stood in Uttam Nagar on Saturday night
 tabhi 2 log aae or mohan garden kii taraf auto book karke le gaye
 After stopping the auto near Mohan Garden, asking to bring any goods, he went and asked the auto driver to wait
 itani der main auto driver toilet karne chalaa gaya or jab wo waapas lautaa to dekha ki bheed un donon kii pitayee kar rahi thi
 Both the accused told the crowd that auto driver Avinash is their kingpin
 maukey par maujuud bheed ne apana gussa auto driver par utaar diya or uski jamkar pitayee kii
 The mob beat Avinash so much that he died in the hospital
 darasal, auto me baithne vaale dononaropeechor the or bydaree churaakar use avinaash ke auto main rakh diya tha
 At present, both the accused are admitted to the hospital in a gross condition
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mritak shahjahanpur kaa rahane vaala he or dilli ke vikasnagar main rahakar auto chalaata tha
 Police has registered a case under section 304 in this case
 vahiin marpet karne vaale ek aaropee ko giraftaar bhi kiya he, jisase police lagaataar poochtacha kar rahi he
 At present, Uttam Nagar police station has done a postmortem of the dead body and handed it over to the family
 aropiyonke khilaaf maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he, lekin ye vaardaat ek baar phir bheed ke jaanaleva gusse ko sabit karne ke saath hi insaaniyat ko bhi sharmasaar karti he
 If you read only the books of Karl Marx, you will be surrounded by fear
 kuch or kitaaben padho
 Some such Vyomkesh Bakshi told the boy, who had come out to make revolution but was surrounded by the party because of criticizing the party
 ab party ke liye kiye apane gunahon or maarane ke liye peechha kar rahe party ke logon se bachanaa chahta tha
 So i used to walk with a razor in the bag
 film khatm hoti he to vamavaadi ladkaa nayak or jasoos vyomakesh bakshi se nai kitaaben maangata he
 Bakshi gives her to read Animal Farm, a book by Soviet communism critic George Orwell, but Vyomkesh's assistant takes the animal farm out of his hand and asks him to read the book Bangla
 yaad nahin kab itani bheed ke saath koi film dekhi thi
 Perhaps Raja Babu or Dabangg may have seen it, but the Bengali audience in Kolkata would not see Hindi cinema's viewers even after all the marketing elements, compared to the passion with which they watch Tollywood movies
 naveena single cinema theatre he
 Here today we saw the Bengali film 'vyomkesh Phire Ailo' (vyomkesh Phir Aaye Gaya)
 theatre har umr ke darshak khachaakhach bharaa tha
 People were happy as soon as the title of Vyomkesh appeared on the screen
 shuru main maine communist kranti ke naam par partibaji or lumpangiri ke prasang kaa zikr isliye kiya taaki yah jhalak mil sake ki bengal vam-smriti se kitna dur nikal aayaa he or uske paas left kii kisi bachikhuchi chhavi he
 The audience also does not counteract this theme, but naturally accepts it
 'vyomakesh phire elo' ek behtareen film he
 The craft of Bangla films is more agile than Mumbai films in telling and holding the story
 shaayad isi kaa asar hoga ki kolkata kii prishthbhumi par bani sujoy ghosh kii film 'kahani' jasusi kaa romaanch paidaa karti he
 Mumbai filmmakers have also made espionage films, but are quite weak compared to Kolkataites
 film sound or digital iffect ke sahare nahin badhati, balki ksaa hua samvaad or plot use aage badhaata he
 The thrill of espionage is still left in the literature of Bengal
 shardendu bandhopadhyaay ne vyomakesh bakshi par qareeb tees upanyaas likhe hai
 Many big directors from Satyajit Ray to Rituparno have made films with the character of Vyomkesh Bakshi
 'vyomakesh phire elo' anjan datta production kii teesri film he
 Espionage and murder have been filmed in such a tight way that the audience remains mesmerized
 abhinay bhi shandaar he
 Returning viewers have the pleasure of seeing a good film on their face
 bas vyomakesh babu kaa har baat par cigarette jala lenaa acha nahin laga
 Despite the constitutional warning, many characters of the film continue to smoke cigarettes
 koi naitik tippanee nahin kar rahaa, lekin ye to vahi baat ho gai ki bina cigarette ke jasusi ho hi nahin sakati
 Then it has to be seen in the context of Bengal
 sadak par har doosraa aadmi cigarette peetaa dikhataa he
 If you understand Bangla, you just watch the film

 The FIR has alleged that the loans given were later converted into non-performing assets (npas) causing losses to the bank, while the accused and borrowers were given undue benefits

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often takes decisions that are shocking
 17veen loksabhaa adhyaksh pad ke liye kota-bundi se saansad om birla ke naam par muhar lagaakar ek baar phir se sabko chaunkaa diya he
 Former Union Ministers Maneka Gandhi, Radhamohan Singh, SS Ahluwalia and Drs
 virendra kumaar jaise kai diggaj netaaon ko peeche chhodte hue om birla loksabhaa adhyaksh bane hai
 Om Birla's journey to parliamentary politics is not very long
 vah duusari baar saansad chune gaye hai or isse pehle kota south se teen baar vidhayak rahe hai
 Despite this, Birla has overtaken mps of eight and seven times
 haalanki saamaajik kshetra main unke dwaara kiye kaam or party sanghathan main kaam karne ke anubhav ko tavajjo mili he or party ne loksabhaa adhyaksh pad ke liye unhen chunaa he
 In fact, many of the bjp's names for the post of Lok Sabha Speaker were in the race
 inamen aath baar kii loksabhaa sadsy menka gandhi bijepi kii sabase anbhavi loksabhaa sadsy hai or adhyaksh pad ke liye ek swaabhaavik vikalp maani ja rahi thim
 Apart from this, when six-time MP Radhamohan Singh did not get a place in the Modi cabinet, it was speculated that he could be made the Lok Sabha Speaker
 isi tarah saatvin baar saansad bane dow
 There was also heated discussion about Virender Singh being made the speaker
 jab unhen protem spikar banaaya gaya to kaha jane laga ki 2004 main jis prakaar somnath chatarji ko pehle protem spikar banaaya gaya or baad main unhen loksabhaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 On the same lines, it was believed that the name of Virendra Singh could be stamped, but instead of all these names, PM Modi has once again made everyone happy by choosing Om Birla as the speaker
 pradhanmantri narendra modi hameshaa apane faisle se sabhi ko chaunkaate rahe hai
 Before this, the announcement of demonetisation or the seal of Ramnath Kovind for the President
 aise kai ahm faisle narendra modi ne liye hai jo logon ko aashcharya chakit kar dene vaale the
 Om Prakash Birla's name has also been included for the Lok Sabha Speaker in this episode
 bataa den ki june 2017 main raashtrapati pad ke liye kai naamon par kayaas lagaae ja rahe the, lekin narendra modi ne dalit samudaay se aane vaale ramnath kovind ke naam ko aage badhaakar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya tha
 Similarly, after the Haryana and Jharkhand assembly elections in 2014, everyone was surprised by the name of Manohar Khattar and Raghuvar Das for the Chief Minister
 piem modi ke aise hi ek faisle ke liye 8 november, 2016 ke aitihaasik din ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 On this date, PM Modi came on TV at 8 pm and suddenly he announced that from 12 pm on the same day, the circulation of 500 and 1000 notes will stop
 unki is ghoshnaa se puraa desh sann rah gaya
 Barring the media or anyone else, even many senior members of the Union Cabinet did not realize what PM Modi was about to announce
 narendra modi ne loksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle saamaanya varg ko aarakshan dekar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya tha
 On January 7, 2019, the PM decided to provide 10 percent reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the poor people of the general category
 iske baad samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko sansad se paas bhi karaayaa
 There have been many other pm's decisions, which was surprising to the people
