 intermediat-range newclear forces (ienef) sandhi se alag hone ke ek hafte baad hi america ne medium range krooj missile kaa test kiya
 The US Defense Department announced this on Monday, saying that we successfully test-fired the Medium Range Cruise Missile a few weeks after breaking out of the Cold War treaty with Russia
 missile ko ravivaar ko america nausena ne niyantrit san nicholas dweep se launch kiya
 The missile was released from the ground mobile launcher which targeted its target at a distance of 500 km
 pentagon ne ek bayaan main yah jaankaree di
 More recently, Defense Minister Mark Asper said that the US would fully develop conventional ground-launched missiles after withdrawing from the Cold War-era intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement
 asper ne kaha, "ab jab ham samjhaute se nikal aae hai, raksha vibhaag in paaramparik ground-lonchd mixilon ko puri tarah viksit karegaa
 "he described the move as an appropriate step in response to Russian action
 bayaan ke anusaar, america ne 2017 main ground-lonchd mixilon ke liye pehle se hi kaam shuru kar diya he
 The statement claimed that these projects are at an early stage to follow the rules of the INF Treaty

 The Congress may have tried to convert Rohit Vemula and JNU case into one big issue, but in Parliament it seems to be lagging behind on both issues
 rohit maamle ko jahaan mayawati ne pakad liya he vahiin jeenyu ke mudde par left haaavee nazar aa rahi he
 In the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati raised the issue on the Rohit Vemula case, while Left tried to move forward on the JNU case
 in donon maamalon ko aage bad kar haath main lene vaali congress sadan main kahin peeche khadi nazar aayi
 Even the Congress did not differentiate between the two issues first and then stood in the Rajya Sabha with Mayawati's demand
 ghulaam nabi azaad ne rajyasabha main mayawati kii maang se maang milaate hue kaha ki donon muddon ko alag kar dijie
 Get JNU debated today and Vemula tomorrow
 is par chair ne kaha ki notice alag-alag dena hoga
 Then Prakash Javadekar reminded that those who gave notice of the demand for debate on both the issues themselves are also free
 matlab congress ne hi donon muddon kaa ghalmail kar diya
 On the issue of taking Mayawati for the first time, BK Hariprasad says that everyone has to take along with them in the Parliament, so the Congress is a bit flexible
 hyderabad uniwarsity ho yaa jeenyu sabase pehle pahunchane waalon main rahul gandhi rahe
 He also talked about raising matters in the House
 lekin jab mauqaa aayaa to party kyon peeche rah gai? It is believed that the Congress is trying to join hands with Mayawati in the UP elections, so let them move on the Dalit issue
 congress saansad hanumant raav kaa kahana he ki mayawati mahila hai, cheef ministar thim isliye ye mudda pehle unhen uthaane diya
 While PL Punia of Congress only clarifies that notice is given in the parliamentary system
 jisane pehle de diya usne uthaa liya
 But Rahul is the first to stand against injustice
 tippaniyan On the other hand, in the Lok Sabha, the BJP very clearly attacked Rahul Gandhi by directly linking the JNU case with nationalism
 sutara bataate hai ki congress ko isi baat kaa dar tha ki use kahin rashtrawaad ke mudde par nuksaan na uthaanaa pad jaae
 But Rajiv Shukla does not believe it
 ve kehete hai congress mudde ke saath khadi he, koun pehle koun baad main isse fark nahin padataa, rashtrawaad kaa sawaal he to congress sabase aage he
 Those who are guilty in the JNU case should be caught and the innocent should not be implicated
 haalanki jyotiraditya sindhiya ne rashtrawaad or puure jeenyu kii chhavi par prahaar ko alag karne kii koshishi kii
 But the BJP has issued an order asking its leaders to be aggressive on the JNU case
 aise main jaankaar maanate hai ki abhivyakti kii azaadi kii vakaalat karti congress kahin rashtrawaad ke ulat na dikhe isliye usne apana haath thodaa peeche rakhana hi behatar samajha
 When Anurag Thakur was attacking Rahul Gandhi directly, Rahul's not saying anything also went against the party's interest
 rajyasabha main mayawati ne rohit vemula maamle par shankhanaad kar diya to jeenyu maamle ko lekar left ne aage badhane kii koshish kii
 The Congress, which took these two matters forward and was seen somewhere behind in the House
 yahaan tak ki congress ne donon muddon ke bich pehle fark nahin kiya or phir rajyasabha main mayawati kii maang ke saath khadi nazar aayi
 Ghulam Nabi Azad joined the demand of Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha and said that separate the two issues
 jeenyu par aaj or vemula par kal bahes kara lijie
 On this, the Chair said that the notice will have to be given separately
 phir prakaash jaavdekar ne yaad dilaayaa ki donon muddon par saath bahes kii maang kaa notice dene waalon main khud azaad bhi shaamil hai
 Meaning that Congress has conflated both the issues
 mayawati ko pehle mauqaa le udne ke mudde par bike hariprasad kehete hai ki sansad main sabko saath lekar chalanaa he isliye congress thodi lacheelee hui he
 Be it Hyderabad University or JNU, Rahul Gandhi was among the first to reach
 sadan main maamle uthaane kii baat bhi unhone kii
 But when the opportunity came, why did the party lag behind? mana ja rahaa he ki upi chunaav main congress mayawati ke saath haath milaane kii koshish main juty he isliye dalit mudde par unhen aage badhane diya
 Congress MP Hanumantha Rao says that Mayawati is a woman, she was a Chief Minister, so let her raise the issue first
 jabaki congress ke hi piel punia safai dete hai ki sansadeey vyavastha main notice diya jaataa he
 He who gave first took it away
 lekin rahul anyaay ke kilaaf sabase pehle khadey hai
 The comments udhar loksabhaa main bijepi ne badi safai se jeenyu maamle ko sidhe rashtrawaad se jod kar rahul gandhi par jam kar prahaar kiye
 Sources reveal that the Congress was afraid that it might have to suffer loss on the issue of nationalism
 lekin rajeev shukla ise nahin maanate
 They say the Congress stands with the issue, who does not matter first or later, the Congress is at the forefront of nationalism
 jeenyu maamle main jo doshi hon unke pakadaa jaae nirdosh ko na fansaaya jaae
 However, Jyotiraditya Scindia tried to separate the attack on nationalism and the image of the entire JNU
 lekin bijepi ne apane netaaon se jeenyu maamle par aakraamak rahane kaa farmaan jari kiya he
 In such a situation, the experts believe that the Congress advocating freedom of expression does not appear to be the opposite of nationalism, so it is better to put your hand a little back
 jab anuraag thakur rahul gandhi par sidhe prahaar kar rahe the tab rahul kaa kuch na bolnaa bhi party ke hit ke viruddh gaya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad joined the demand of Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha and said that separate the two issues

 Smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by 15 to 30 times and these people are also more likely to die of lung cancer than those who do not smoke
 niskriy dhumrapaan yani dhumrapaan karne vaale aasapaas rahanaa bhi bahut hanikaarak he
 Studies have shown that exposure to inactive tobacco increases lung cancer risk by 20 percent
 fefde ke cancer ke anya jokhim kaarak radon, esbestus, koyale kaa dhuaan or anya rasayanon ke sampark main rahanaa he
 "based on the data, Dr

 Batra pointed out that the most important factor to prevent lung cancer would be to avoid exposure to tobacco (active or inactive)
 dhumrapaan ko chhodana bahut mushkil nahin he or yadi prayaas kiya jaye to isamen kabhi der nahin lagati
 If you stop smoking before the age of 50, you can reduce the risk of lung cancer by half in the next 10-15 years

 This bill was already passed by the Lok Sabha
 isse pehle espiji bill par grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi kii suraksha kii chook main jimmedaar teen surakshakarmiyon ko suspend kiya gaya he
 In the incident that took place at Priyanka's house, Amit Shah said that an incident occurred at Priyanka Vadra's house

 samay vahi tha or gaadi bhi kaali thi to security agenciyon ne unhen jane diya
 It was a coincidence

 Home Minister Amit Shah said that Gandhi family was not brought to mind, first of all i want to remove the misconceptions about this bill
 sadan ke jo do sadsy ye kah rahe the ki is bill ko do pariwaron ko dhyaan main rakhkar ke laayaa gaya, wo hakeekat nahin he
 i want to say clearly that this bill was not brought in keeping with the three members of the Gandhi family
 unhone kaha ki jo purana kanoon tha, us aadhaar par gandhi parivaar kii suraksha samiksha ke aadhaar par unki espiji suraksha hataa lee gai he
 For this, they have been given second protection
 act ke andar 4 baar parivartan hughamit shah ne kaha ki vivek tankhaa ne jo sawaal uthaaya, wo thik nahin he
 There have been four changes inside the Act, this is the 5th change

 Why is the issue being raised about a family? Home Minister Amit Shah said that the Modi government has the responsibility of protecting not only the Gandhi family but also the 130 crore people of the country
 lekin ye jid karnaa ki mujhe espiji chahie to ye jid mujhe samaj main nahin aati he
 Those who belong to the SPG, none come from abroad
 kyon ek parivaar kii suraksha ko lekar mudda uthaaya ja rahaa he?raksha mantri vaali suraksha gandhi parivaar ke paas haiunhone kaha ki ham loktantric desh main ji rahe hai
 Therefore the law is equal for all
 ek parivaar ke liye kanoon nahin hota he
 The security of the Gandhi family has not been removed, but has been changed
 jitne pehle espiji ke jawan the, utane hi jawan unki suraksha main lage hue hai
 He said that the security given to the Defense Minister and Home Minister of the country has been given to the Gandhi family

 When this exemption was calculated, it is coming out that only 49 lakh people will get the benefit of tax exemption, whereas this year 6 crore 85 lakh people have filed the return
 haalanki sarkaar kaa daawa he ki sabhi tarah ke investment or chhot milakar ye sankhya 3 karod tak pahunch jaaegi
 2 so far in the budget
 5 se 3
 There was a provision of tax exemption of five thousand rupees due to section 87A for income up to 5 lakhs
 yah chhot ab 2
 5 to 5 lakh rupees has been increased to 12,500 rupees
 iskaa matlab he ki pehle 3,60,000 selary jisaki hoti thi use 40 hajaar kii standard didction kii chhot milti thi
 At that time taxable salary was made at Rs
 3,20,000 and tax on it was Rs
 1040
 87 e kii chhot kii vajah se ye tex shunya ho jaataa tha
 Because of this no tax was levied
 ab standard didction kii chhot 40 hajaar se 50 hajaar rupee karne par texable selary 3,10,000 ho gai
 Due to the exemption, there will be no tax on it
 jinaki inakam 5 lakh se 6 lakh heselary se inakam 5,50,000 rupee thi to usapar 40 hajaar rupee standard didction miltaa tha
 Taxable salary was then made at 5 lakh 10 thousand
 is par tex lagata tha 15,080 rupee
 Now with the increase in the standard deduction limit, taxable salary will be 5 lakhs
 ab is par bhi koi tex nahin dena hoga
 The income of which is 6 to 10 lakhs, whose income was 8 lakh 50 thousand rupees, because of the limit of their standard deduction, taxable salary of Rs 8 lakh 10 thousand was received
 is par 77 hajaar 480 rupee tex lagata tha
 Now, due to increase in the limit of standard deduction, Rs 75,400 will be taxed
 is tarah 2080 rupee kii bachat hogi
 The income of which is more than 10 lakhs, whose salary was 10 lakh 50 thousand rupees, there was taxable salary of Rs 10 lakh 10 thousand after deducting the standard deduction
 is par 1 lakh 20 hajaar 120 rupee tex banataa tha
 Now, after increasing the limit of standard deduction, there will be a tax of 1 lakh 17 thousand rupees
 isamen 3,120 rupee kii bachat hogi
 Income from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, whose income is more than Rs 50 lakh, they will save Rs 3,432
 jinaki inakam 1 karod rupee se zyada he unhen 3,588 rupee kaa laabh hoga
 Now there are such tax slabs
 According to the slab of income tax, there is no tax up to Rs 2
5 lakh, 5 per cent from Rs 2
5 to Rs 5 lakh, 20 per cent from 5 lakh to 10 lakh and 30 percent tax on income above 10 lakh
 
 is par 4 fisad kaa ses bhi lagata he
 If there is more than 50 lakh income, then 10 percent surcharge and if there is more than 1 crore income, then 15 percent surcharge is also charged
 6 karod 85 lakh log inakam tex vibhaag ke daayre membharat main 2018 main 6 karod 85 lakh log inakam tex vibhaag ke daayre main aate hai jo ritern file karte hai
 This number was 5 crore 57 lakh in 2017, 4 crore 63 lakh in 2016, 4 crore 4 lakh in 2015 and 3 crore 80 lakh in 2014
 inamen se 3 lakh 50 hajaar se 4 lakh inakam vaale slab main 15 lakh 93 hajaar 322, chaar lakh se 4 lakh 50 hajaar rupee inakam vaale slab main 16 lakh 86 hajaar 535 or 4 lakh 50 hajaar se 5 lakh vaale slab main 16 lakh 67 hajaar 740 karadaata tex bharte the
 In this way, 49 lakh 37 thousand 607 taxpayers used to pay tax of 2, 22, 842 crores, which will no longer have to pay tax
 kya hota he standard didconstandard didction aay kaa wo hissaa hota he, jis par koi tex nahin dena hota he

 ek taraf dilli sarkaar ke mantri satyendra jain inakam tex kii jaanch ke ghere main hai to duusari taraf mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chitthee likhakar chote vyapaariyon par inakam tex se red na dalwane kii apil kii he
 However, as usual, Arvind Kejriwal's letter seemed to target the Prime Minister rather than the real issues
 chitthee kii shuruyaat main kejariwal ne kaale dhan kii vaapasi kaa mudda uthaate hue likhaa he ki "aapke inakam tex department kii nayi muhim se chote dukandaar or vyapaaree ghabaraae hue hai
 The news has been published that raids are being conducted on the road side of Barapav and Jalebi sellers
 kejariwal ne likhaa he ki aapane oktober se puure desh ke 1 lakh chote vyapaariyon par chapa maarane kaa aadesh de diya he
 i have also got a job in the income tax department, so i could not believe that these small traders could raid
 chunaav ke pehle aapane kaha tha ki bharat ke hajaaron karod rupye kaledhan ke rup main videshon main jamaa hai or agar aap satta main aaye to ek ek pai desh main vaapis laayi jaayegi
 You also said that every poor can get Rs 15 to 20 lakhs from this money
 desh ne aap par bharosa kiya lekin satta main aane ke baad aapane kuch nahin kiya
 "arvind Kejriwal further wrote to the Prime Minister that" instead of taking action against those possessing black money, your government advised them to make black money white
 inakam diclaration skim ke naam par bhrashtachariyon ko ye chhot de di gayi he ki wo kuch tex dekar kaala dhan safed kar len
 Your government assured that the money earned from kidnapping, extortion, drug trade and bribery will never be investigated
 aapako ummid thi ki is skim se kareeb 1 lakh karod kii kaali kamai safed hogi or 45 hajaar karod kii tex vasuuli dikhaakar aap apni peeth thok sakenge lekin aapaki skim buree tarah flop hui
 a few days before the end of the scheme, only 4 thousand crores of black money was disclosed in place of 1 lakh crores, whereas in 1997 black money of more than thirty thousand crores was revealed in such a scheme
 "siem aravind kejariwal ne aarope ke baan chhodte hue piem modi ko apni aatma kii awaz sunne ko kaha he
 Kejriwal pleaded in sharp fashion that "modi government should stop calling the small businessman of the country a thief and stop raiding him
" jis chote vyapaaree ne aapako vot dekar pradhanmantri banaaya tha uske khilaaf atyaachaar karke aapaki aatma bhi kachhotegi
 It is gross injustice to ruin petty traders, to send them to jail, to seal their accounts, to lock their shops

 Modi was addressing the Indian community here
 unhone kaha, ‘yah donon deshon ke liye phaayde kii baat he
 "the Prime Minister said," To achieve our objective of making India a manufacturing hub, professional Indians living in Germany can become bridges between India and Germany
 ’ iske saath hi modi ne ‘santulit vruddhi’ kii jarurat ko rekhaankit karte hue kaha ki krishi, vinirmaan va seva kshetra par samaan jor diya janaa chahie
 Criticizing the IT revolution, Modi said that Indians have to play a big role in it

 Along with this, he said that if professionals were assured of a good environment in India, then the companies like Google could have started in India

 In an outrageous remark at a reception organized by the Indian community in Berlin, Modi said, "we are a hurricane in our neighborhood, but when we get out, we know where we are
" hamen kai chizon kaa pataa chalata he or ham pratispardhaa va nai oonchaaiyaan hasil karne ko prerit hote hai
 He reiterated that making India a manufacturing hub is not only an economic goal for him but also a 'self-respect movement'
 modi ne kaha ki anek utpaada baahar se aate hai
 In a light tone, he said, 'we also have to get tear gas cans from outside

 According to the traffic police, the bus and auto marked in the list were moving around with no permit or expired permit

 ek trephic adhikari ne kaha, ek baar in gadiyon ke registration certificate radd hone ke baad ye gadiyaan sadakon par nahin daud paaegi
 The traffic police has decided to take strict action on buses and auto rickshaws without permits
 jis bas main 16 disambar ko gangrape hua tha uskaa varsh 2011-12 main aath baar chaalaan hua tha or chah baar bas ko roka ja chukaa tha

 He also said that there should be strict laws for this so that these trains do not run illegally
 agar trephic police, parivahan vibhaag or court ek saath milakar kaam kare to ye gadiyaan avaidh rup se nahin chal paaegi
 Actress Payal Rohatgi, who was arrested in a controversial video case of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his father Motilal Nehru, has recently come out on bail

 paayal ne bataaya ki jail main unke saath rah rahi mahila kaidiyon ne unka puraa sahyog kiya he or isiilie vah mahila kaidiyon ke liye barrack main LED lagane kii maang karengi
 It may be known that Payal Rohatgi had posted a video on social media in which he used objectionable words for Jawaharlal Nehru and his father
 iske baad unke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai gai jiske baad unhen bundi police ne ahmedabad se giraftaar kar liya
 View this post on Instagram Today we talk about some other examples which proves that Swami Nityananda's is being targeted unfairly by the media of India
 2016 main Mysore High court ne ek ladki jisane Swami ji ke kilaaf rape kaa case darj kiya tha usko galat tehraaya or use 2
 जुर्माना Corruption penalty was paid but media did not telecast any news on it
 ab # sarahlandry karke ek videshi mahila Republic news TV par swami ji ke kilaaf bayaan de rahi he
 Republic TV which is a government supporting channel is also promoting this thinking
 yah Sarah ke bahut videos he 2017 se feb 2019 tak jahaan wo swaami ji ke bare main acha bol rahi he or ab usne apana bayaan badal liya 🧐 dikhaata he uskaa dogalapan 
 Seeing all this, we feel that a wrong case may have been put on Asaram Babu ji also because the girl who alleged that her friend told in the media that the girl had told her that there was pressure on this to give this statement
 
 saath hi POSCO act nahin lag saktaa tha kyunki ladki baalik thi papers ke anusaar
 But Asaram Babu ji is punished, even in the case of this crime and the Indian media has told a lot of lies in this case

 But the names he released are fictitious names Hindu which is very wrong as they all belong to the same community, according to the video of # yatinarsimhasaraswati
 yah agar sach he to Telangana police jaan buchakar communal angle khud de rahi he hindu naam laakar dharm nirpeksha ke aadhaar par
 i heard DCP Prakash Reddy's statement that how this accident is not communal which is false
 saath main bharat sarkaar se darkhaast he ki POSCO act dwaara child balaatkaari ko phaansi mili yah kaanoon ko implement bhi karnaa chahie
 And the rapist should be sentenced to death within 6 months
 saath main bharat ke andar jo bollywood vaale porn actors ko kaam dete hai apana picture or dhandha chalaane ke chakkar main wo bhi yah balaatkaar ke vichaardhaara main aaropee hai

 1903 main yuvati sivaakamu ke saath unka vivaah hua
 Here, not 5 September, celebrates Teacher's Day on 5 October, this is the reason- Radhakrishnan studied the Bible and the philosophy of Swami Vivekananda at the age of 12

 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was elected President, it is an honor for the world philosophy
 main unke raashtrapati banane se bahut khush hum
 Plato said that philosopher should be king and king should be philosopher
 dow
 The Republic of India has paid a true tribute to Plato by making Radhakrishnan the President
 '- varsh 1962 main unke kuch prashansak or shishyon ne unka janmdin manaane kii ichha jaahir kii to unhone kaha, 'mere liye isse bade sammaan kii baat or kuch ho hi nahin sakati ki meraa janmdin shikshak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaae
 'and since then September 5 has been celebrated as Teachers' Day

 Why Team India's Lootia drowned in t-twenty World Cup
 
 The When captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni blamed the late night party of the IPL for this, the BCCI and IPL officials fell on him
 lekin, ab jo sachai beparda hui he, wo bataati he ki dhoni ne bilkul thik kaha
 During the IPL party, players drowned the fleet of Team India by drowning in alcohol and youthfulness
 itnaa hi nahin, khabar to yahaan tak ai ki khilaadiyon ke kamare main ladkiyaan bhi jaati thi
 Only one player has revealed that Dhoni did not say anything wrong
 ipel party ke liye dabaav naa sahi, lekin halaat aise bana die gaye the ki khilaadiyon ke kadam khud ba khud party haul main pahunch jate the
 The news that has appeared in a newspaper quoting an anonymous player who has played in the IPL is very sensational
 us khilaadi ke mutabik, sari ipel partiyon kaa routine ek jaisaa hi tha
 The fashion show lasted for 35 to 45 minutes and then after getting off the ramp, the models used to mix with the people who came to the party
 vahaan modells ke alaava chiyarliders or duusari ladkiyaan hoti thim, jinhen ham escort sarvice kehete hai
 The party had beautiful women to mingle with glamor and the party began to climb
 unhen kisi bhi khilaadi se paanch minute se zyaada baat karne kii izaajat nahin thi
 If she talked for more than five minutes, a manager would remove her from there
 lekin, in partiyon main sabhi khilaadiyon ko mahilaon se dur nahin rakhaa jaataa tha
 According to the anonymous player, who was a well-known player, nothing prevents him from being with beautiful women
 wo saath rahete, baaten karte, jam chhalakaate or mouj-masti karte the
 Sometimes even in a hotel room
 khilaadiyon ke kamare main ladakiyon kii maujuudagi kaa ye khulaasa bahut sansanikhez he
 The player who has been witness to these parties, who has opened this poll, also told the players' helplessness that why the players used to go to these parties
 aksar ipel ke adhikari, praayojak yaa phir tiimon ke maalik khilaadiyon se kehete the ki agar kuch der ke liye party main aaoge, to acha rahegaa
 Some people there would like to meet you
 main rahul dravid yaa tendulkar nahin tha ki kah detaa ki main nahin aauungaa
 Often players thought that the party would go on for an hour
 lekin, vahaan jane ke baad 4 baje se pehle hotel ke kamare main lautne kaa hosh hi nahin rahata tha
 For the under-19 and under-22 players, the party was a wonder
 nae khilaadiyon ne kabhi bollywood stars, pej-thri persenalitys, muft kii mahangi cigarette or sharaab, kabhi-kabhi drugs bhi or itani dher sari hasinaaon ko nahin dekha tha
 Those who do not smoke cigarettes also joined the Cool Gang of IPL party
 ab jaahir he ki jab ipel ke adhikari or team ke maalik hi party main aane ke liye kah rahe hon, to bhala kitne cricketer khud ko is raunak se dur rah pate? wo bhi tab, jab party team ke hotel main hi ho rahi he
 What would be the condition of the players attending these parties, you can guess that they had to play the match till late evening
 phir subah 4 baje tak party
 After returning from the party, they had to pack their luggage for the next match so that they could catch the flight on time

 So far, a total of 50 witnesses have turned their statements in this case
 kya tha cese?aapako bataa den ki soharabuddin shaikh or uski patni kaa november 2005 main encounter hua tha
 During the investigation and hearing of the case, the Supreme Court had said that the investigation of this case was being affected in Gujarat and transferred the case to Mumbai in 2012 and said that the trial of the case from the beginning to the end would be done by a single judge
 haalanki 2014 main hi jaj jetti utpat kaa transfar kar diya gaya

 The Banaras Hindu University was founded in 1916 by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya
 tab se lekar aaj tak yah uniwarsity apane janak ke uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nirantar desh ke nirmaan main shiksha kaa upyog karti aa rahi he
 But nearing the completion of hundred years of its establishment, this renowned university is adopting new courses with the demand of time instead of staying in one place and becoming a part of history
 vahiin bahut-se duusare puraane institute ateet ke garbh main samaa chuke hai
 This mobility of this university can be clearly seen in India Today group-nielsen's Best University Survey
 2013 main chauthe or pichley saal tisare sthaan par rahane ke baad lagaataar badhat banaate hue biechayu is baar duusare sthaan par pahunch gai
 The reason for the continued growth of this university is that in addition to excellence in the field of Arts and Science, it has recognized the changes that have been taking place over time and has adapted itself accordingly
 masalan, 2008 main shuru kiye gaye course centre for study of soshal exklujan and inclusive policy ko liya ja saktaa he
 This course is designed to analyze the politics of direct or indirect discrimination prevailing in our socio-political society
 saamaajik nyaay or atmasamman se jude andolanon ko vyapak vishyon main shaamil karte hue yah centre itihaas ko nae sire se padhgaye par jor detaa he
 The university now also offers mphil and phd in subaltern studies
 yahaan adhyayan main jitna dhyaan theory par diya jaataa he, utana hi prayogon par bhi diya jaataa he
 In this way research can also be done in academically neglected areas
 malviya centre for pis research ko ujisi kii aathvin yojana ke tahat 1998 main shuru kiya gaya tha
 This department is also becoming increasingly popular
 yahaan sangharsh ke vibhinn kshetron kii dashaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In February 2014, Professor Priyankar Upadhyay of this department was awarded the ICCR Chair Professorship at Dublin City University
 agar soshal exklujan or pis research centre vibhinn rajnatik dhaaraon kaa adhyayan karata he or saarvajanik niti nirmaan kii disha main kaam karata he to centre for integrated rural department hafte main do baar herbal kaltivation trainingkorsachalaata he, jo chaatro ko unki jadon se jodgaye kaa kaam karata he or unhen is baat kaa prashikshan detaa he ki herbal chaay, tel or aushadhiy kadha kaise taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 We know that the Faculty of Visual Arts studies the nuances of fine arts
 lekin isamen aplide art ke taur par plastic, taxtile or pottery kii kakshaon ko shaamil karnaa fine arts kii vyapaktaa ko pradarshit karata he
 This is a rare thing for such a course, but in the minds of the students studying full time of Fine Arts, it develops a new concept about their art
 vigyaapan or dizin ko bhi jodgaye vaala yah course aaj ke bazaar aadhaarit corson se alag he
 The university is preparing to start studying various courses related to each other under the choice-based credit system
 is tarah kaa course agle shaikshik satr se shuru hone vaala he
 Vice Chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi believes that the idea of interlinking the various courses is in keeping with bhu's vision, which aims to provide holistic education to students
 ve kehete hai, “har vyakti main kai tarah kii pratibhaaen hoti hai or agar aap uski urja ko kisi ek kshetra main simit kar dete hai to baaki kii pratibhaaen khatm ho jaati hai or uskaa vyaktitv adhuraa rah jaataa he
 The idea of education related to each other gives our personality a chance to grow fully
 ham apane chaatro ko aisa avasar or manch dena chaahate hai, jahaan ve kariyar banane ke is uddeshy ko puraa kar saken
 "while there is still some time left to start such a course, in the meantime various departments of the university are trying to raise their level

 Vice Chancellor Tripathi recalls the old reputation of the Banaras Hindu University, stating, "onkarnath Thakur, the first dean of the erstwhile music faculty, (dictator Benito of Italy) treated Mussolini's insomnia by playing sleepy melodies
 kai dinon tak na so paane se chidchide musolini ne unke is ilaaj ko aajamaane kaa faisla kiya
 The result is an example in itself
 musolini kai dinon kii anidra kii bharpai karte hue kisi bachche kii tarah kai dinon tak sote rahe
 This story of Mussolini may not be authentic, but there is no doubt that even today bhu's reputation is standing like a rock

 Yes, this is what is wrong with our society
 Shallow Designers like @falgunishanepeacockindia conveniently telling a fat bride “it’s easy to lose a few inches’ and then come back to buy a wedding lehenga”
 
 i mean
 
 how about YOU make a dress instead that would fit the bride’s size wouldn’t that be easier Falguni
 And, what on earth do you mean by fat women should wear high necks and flared skirts, and not fitted clothes
 
 i mean your idea to dress a fat bride is to put her in a sack
 Disgraceful
 
 You and designers like you are toxic
 Filling young mind's with fake idea of what beauty is
 Ugh!! Let women and men be
 Everyone is beautiful
 
 Be it a size 2 or or size 22
 
 everyone is gorgeous And everyone has the right to wear and dress and buy the clothes that they’d like
 n your job is to make that fuckin dress available in every size
 Period
 😠 # stopthistoxicity let's make # fashion available for all
 Shall we?

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar arrived at 10 Janpath on Monday to meet the interim president of Congress Sonia Gandhi and felt that the deadlock in Maharashtra might be over today
 lekin sonia gandhi se meeting ke baad press conference main sharad pavaar ne yah kahkar shivasena kii in ummiido par ek tarah se pani hi pher diya ki ab to sarkaar ban hi jaaegi
 Shiv Sena's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut has consistently claimed to have formed the government
 wo bole chuke hai, 'ham sadan main 170 vidhayakon ke aankade ke saath bahumat siddh karenge
 Sharad Pawar is experienced, he wants the government
 isliye unka anubhav kaam aayega
 We have no doubt about Sharad Pawar
 ensipi or congress ke saath milakar ham agle paanch saal tak sarkaar chalaayenge
 After the meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar said that the Congress and NCP leaders will interact with the leaders of both parties besides taking stock of the situation
 ab tak sarkaar gathan ko lekar koi charchaa nahin hui
 We did not discuss other issues
 ham sthiti par najar banaae rakhenge
 Only after taking the opinion of all the leaders will we decide the way forward

 This concern of Shiv Sena was evident in Sanjay Raut's talk of meeting Sharad Pawar late in Delhi
 sharad pavaar se mulaakaat ke baad sanjay raut ne kaha ki sarkaar gathan kii jimmedaari sirf hamaari nahin he
 Those who have responsibility (BJP) have already run away from him
 lekin mujhe puraa bharosa he ki ham jald hi sarkaar bana le lenge
 Interestingly, NCP and Congress are talking to the Shiv Sena about the government, but even before meeting Sonia, Sharad Pawar had said that the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena had contested together and now they have to choose their way

 athavle ne kaha ki vah is bare main bijepi se baatcheet karenge

 In the same way, the child of the poor who does not go to school, after six months, will take him to the police station, even if i am hanged
 ’’unhone iske baad maujuud bheed kaa haath uthavakar poocha, ‘‘koi galat kaam to nahin he

 Due to the liberalization done by the Congress government in 1991, this situation has happened today that such a scheme can be implemented
 purv vitt mantri ne kaha ki bharat kii jidipi lagaataar bad rahi he or agle paanch saal main iske dogune hone kii sambhaavna he
 In such a situation it is possible to complete this scheme
 unhone bataaya ki 2019 se 2024 tak bharat kii jidipi 200 se 400 lakh karod tak pahunch jaaegi
 Implementing the NYAY scheme will cost one and a half percent of India's GDP

 According to Rahul, this scheme will be the biggest scheme so far and will be helpful in ending poverty in India
 haalanki, bhartiya janata party ne rahul gandhi kii is skim ko jhooth qaraar diya tha
 On behalf of the BJP, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was fielded, who called the scheme false, stating the history of Congress
 reyaan skool murder cese main police kii jaanch ke dauraan mukhya aaropee banaae gaye skool ke bas conductor ashok kumaar ko mangalvaar ko adaalat ne jamaanat de di
 Gurugram District Judge granted conditional bail to Ashok on a bond of Rs 50,000
 adaalat ne saath hi ashok ko hidaayat di he ki jarurat padane par use CBI ko jaanch main sahyog dena hoga or shahar chhodane se pehle police ko suchit karnaa hoga
 Ashok's father expressed happiness after getting bail from the court
 unhone kaha,"sibiai or kanoon ne insaaf kiya
 Ashoka was implicated by the school
 uski bahut pitayee kii gai to usne hatya kii baat kabool kii thi
 Now i got justice
 "vahiin pradhyumna ke pita ne kaha he ki unhen kanoon or adaalat par bharosa he or vah nyaay ke liye apni ladaai jari rakhenge
 However, on the audio tape of Ashoka's maternal uncle, which surfaced on Tuesday, he said that it is the subject of investigation
 pinto family ko bhi mili jamaantis bich punjab evam haryana hoicourt ne reyaan skool ke maalikon pinto family ko bhi sashart jamaanat de di he
 Earlier too, the High Court granted immediate relief to the Pinto family on an interim bail appeal, which was challenged by Pradyuman's father in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne phir haryana hoicourt se pinto family kii jamaanat yachika ko 10 din main nipataane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Ashok Kumar's family filed a bail petition in the court on Monday, a day earlier
 somvaar ko adaalat ne donon pakshon kii daleel sunne ke baad jamaanat par faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Earlier on Thursday, the CBI refused to give a clean chit to Ashok in the Juvenile Court
 juvenil court main sibiai ne ashok kumaar kii jamaanat kaa virodh kiya tha
 The CBI had argued that Ashok should be kept in judicial custody till the bail of the case is over
 in binduon ke aadhaar par maangi thi jamaanat- aaropee ashok kumaar nirdosh he
 He has been wrongly implicated in the case
 - jaanch ke baad se ashok nyaayik hiraasat main he
 The offenses which he did not commit are also imposed
 - aaropee bas conductor se kisi tarah kii recovery yaa poochtacha kii jarurat nahin he
 - The second accused in this case has been caught
 aise main bas conductor kii hiraasat kii jarurat hi nahin
 - The accused is a permanent resident of Ghamroj village in Gurugram
 uske faraar hone kaa koi chance nahin he
 The CBI initially questioned accused Ashok Kumar on remand
 iske baad sibiai ne aaropee ko adaalat main pesh kiya tha
 The court sent him to jail
 phir sibiai ne is maamle main reyaan skool ke hi ek naaballig chaatr ko pakadaa or yah kaha ki usee ne pradhyumna thakur kii skool ke andar hatya kii thi
 Due to the accused being a minor, the case is currently going on in the Juvenile Court of Gurgaon Sessions Court
 ashok ke vakil ne pehle juvenil court main hi jamaanat arji daakhil kii, lekin vahaan se jamaanat nahin milane par jila adaalat kaa rukh kiya
 Meanwhile, a suspicious audio tape has surfaced between Ashok Kumar's maternal uncle and the relatives of the newly murdered minor student who came to the CBI investigation, in which all the allegations of Ashok's uncle were heard saying that the school was being attacked
 ashok ke mamaa ne saath hi police par ashok par jurm kabool karne ke lieuard degree torchraistemaal karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 They allege that Ashoka's hands were put into hot water to confess the crime
 uske sir ko thande pani main dubaaya gaya
 He was given several injections

 unhone kaha ki peedita logon se milane ko lekar sajag nahin thi, kyonki har kisi ko baar-baar ek hi baat ripet kerani pad rahi thi
 Why are the media also responsible for this, who repeatedly went to collect bytes from it
 khaastaur par unhone jo clip dekha he jisamen peedita kaa kahana tha ki vah media se baat nahin karegi
 Tejashwi Yadav lashed out at the ruling party in Patna and asked why the Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, who was wiping tears on every incident before, no longer meets the victims
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar chup kyon hai
 Why are the Governor not answering the question raised? Unfortunate the incident: Sushil Modi On the other hand, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted that Gaya's incident was unfortunate
 unhone kaha ki kuch durbhagyapurna ghatnaon par chaati peetane se pehle argedy ko lalu-rabari raaj ke 15 saalon kaa daraavna aapraadhik ricard dekhnaa chahie
 He should explain what action the party took against Rajaballabh Yadav, a prisoner for raping a minor, and why former MP Shahabuddin, who was convicted in several cases including the brutal killing of three sons of a businessman in Siwan, was celebrated on bail
 The People who politicize crime are becoming monks by making rhetoric

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister cum Finance Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has claimed that after the bjp's electoral victories in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, it will now be easy for the central government to take steps for economic reform to strengthen the country

 Referring to the resumed development work in Bihar, Modi said that by reaching the power of 111 habitations in the remaining 11 days of 2017, the target of providing electricity to all 39,073 habitations in the state will be met this year

 upachunaavon ke nattejey aane ke baad bihar main endie ke jediu samet sabhi sahyogi dalon ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar koharaam machaa hua he
 In the midst of political developments, BJP has invited all its NDA partner parties to Patna this evening to mark the completion of four years of Modi government
 is baithak or raatri bhoj main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar
 About 1000 leaders, including the head of Lok Janashakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, will be involved
 bihar main bijepi-jediuke saath sarkaar banane ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab endie ke netaaon kii baithak ho rahi he
 Its main purpose is to show mutual solidarity
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan or kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha samet bijepi ke bhupendra yadav, dipti siem susheel modi, bijepi pradesh adhyaksh nityanand raay, arun kumaar samet sabhi saansad, vidhayak, vidhaan parshad, pradesh padaadhikari or sabhi ghatak dalon ke jiladhyaksh mahabhoj main shaamil honge
 Please tell that Nitish Kumar had split from BJP in 2013, then in July 2017 NDA government was formed in Bihar
 varsho baad ho rahi endie kii is baithak ko lekar raajnneetik galiyare main halchal he
 Especially the importance of the event has increased in view of the poor performance of the NDA in the by-elections
 baithak se pehle jediu ne nitish kumaar ko endie ke cheharaa ghoshit kar diya
 However, BJP and other allies also believed that Bihar's face is Nitish Kumar and the face of the country is Narendra Modi
 jediu ke rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki bijepi ko nitish kii rashtriya chhavi kaa laabh bijepi ko uthaanaa chahie
 He believes that NDA will benefit nationwide
 gauratlab he ki 2019 ke chunaav main bihar menendie kii bich siton kaa bantwaraapar pech fansata hua dikh rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar is worried that the BJP will accept him as a senior partner or not
 2009 main bijepi or jediu ne milakar loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha
 In that time JDU contested 25 seats and BJP 15
 2014 main bijepi or jediu kii rahaa juda ho gai or modi lahar main endie ke khate main 40 main se 31 siten ain thi
 Now again both parties are one
 aise main jediu ne 2019 ke liye 25 siten maangi hai
 At the same time, Paswan has kept demand for 7 seats
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi 22 or algepi 6 or kushvaha kii party ko 3 siton par jeet mili thi
 This is the reason why there is a ruckus about seats in the NDA
 bihar main teji se bad rahi aparaadhik ghatnaon ko lekar shuukravaar ko argedy netaa tejasvi yadav or jadyu ke bich main khub aarope-pratyarope hue
 The body of a 6-year-old girl was found in Munger 2 days ago and her family alleged that the incident of rape of her daughter took place
 isi ghatana ko lekartejsvi yadavane twitor par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki unke netritv main bihar ab balaatkaar raaj ban chukaa he jahaan par 6 saal kii ek naaballig ladki ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana ghati or nitish apni kursi bachaane ke chakkar main bhaajapa kii parikrama kar rahe hai
 Tejashwi said that after raping the mandate, Nitish Kumar's priority is only in saving his chair
 tejasvi yadav ke is hamale se tilamilaai jadyu ne turant palatwaar kiya or unase sawaal poocha ki kya unhen yaad he ki rajd vidhayak rajballabh yadav aakhir koun he or kis maamle main pichley 2 saalon se jail main band he ? gauratlab he ki, rajballabh yadav ek naaballig ladki ke saath balaatkaar karne ke aarope main pichley 2 varshon se jail main band he
 Party spokesperson Sanjay Singh asked Tejashwi Yadav that when he is seeking resignation from Nitish Kumar when such incidents happen, then why did he not resign when he was in government and even when such incidents were happening at that time? The Taking a dig at Tejashwi, Sanjay Singh asked if Rajaballabh Yadav has been imprisoned in Satyagraha
 tejasvi par hamalaa karte hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki jis netaa kii neenv hi bhrashtachar, hatya, narsanhaar, lut, dakaiti, apharan or ghotaale par ho bhala vah netaa janata kii seva kaise kar saktaa he ?jadyu ne kaha ki tejasvi yadav ko sarkaar main rahakar janata kii seva karne kaa mauka ek baar mila tha magar unhone us maukey ko keval dhan arjeet karne main gavaan diya

 Priyanka Gandhi has once again strongly attacked her cousin Varun Gandhi
 unhone varun gandhi par vishwasghaat karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Priyanka said, 'this is not a home tea party
 vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 If they stand with our opposing ideology then obviously we will raise questions
 'priyanka gandhi ne kaha, 'koi kitna bhi kareebi kyon na ho
 If he is on that side of the ideology, then we will be opposed, that is my belief
 main ye baar-baar kah rahi hum ki unhone pichley chunaav main kuch vichaar rakhe the, jinamein main bilkul yakeen nahin karti
 This is a fraud with the family
 mere pita is desh kii ekta ke liye mar gaye
 i can't insult her
 baat bhai kii nahin vichaar kii he
 If my own son also does this, then i will protest
 'isse pehle, amethi main priyanka ne varun gandhi ke khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 Priyanka, while appealing to the people of Sultanpur, had said that she should defeat Varun Gandhi, who is fighting on a BJP ticket, to get him on the right path
 amethi main kaaryakartaaon se baat karte hue unhone kaha tha, 'hamaari ragon main khun or nafrat nahin daudti, prem or ekta daudti he
 If someone is following the wrong path, sometimes in politics, public prudence shows the right path
 'is bich bete par raajnneetik hamalaa bolaa gaya to maa phir se saamne aa gayi
 Maneka in turn explained to Priyanka that what is devotion and patriotism does not require a certificate
 unhone kaha, 'deshseva karnaa bhatakana he to koun rasta bhatak gaya he yah desh bataa degaa
 Varun Gandhi responded to Priyanka Gandhi's attack in a very restrained manner, but also gave the advice to not judge the gestures as weak
 unhone kaha, 'maryaadit raajnneeti karen, dusron ke sammaan ko apana sammaan samajhen
 Do not harm anyone
 kabhi shaleenta kii lakshmana rekha nahin todi he
 Even if there are people from his family, there are senior leaders of other parties
 ham log lakshmana rekha na paar karen
 These days some things have been heard
 keval itnaa kahana chahta hum ki hamaari sharafat or udaartaa ko koi kamajori na samajhe
 The reason for the Jubani war is the very old association of Nehru Gandhi family from amethi-rae Bareli and Sultanpur seats
 ye bhi ittefaq he ki is baar in teenon seat par isi parivaar ke ek-ek daavedaar jame hue hai
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi is fighting on Rae Bareli seat, Rahul Gandhi in Amethi seat, and BJP general secretary Varun Gandhi on Sultanpur seat
 pichhali baar sultanpur seat se congress ke sanjay singh jite the
 But then neither Sonia nor Rahul nor Priyanka went to promote Sanjay Singh
 duusari taraf rahul gandhi ke parchaa daakhile main bhi sanjay singh pehle kabhi nahin jate the
 The party was one, but there was a different kind of sour relationship, but this time in Sultanpur, Varun changed their relationship by contesting elections
 rahul ke parchaa daakhile main sanjay singh ko bulaayaa gaya to sultanpur main sanjay singh kii patni ke liye priyanka vot maangane pahunchi, wo bhi apane hi bhai ke khilaaf
 In fact, the Gandhi family will need Sanjay Singh's help in Amethi
 aise main bayaanbaji ke hi jariye sanjay singh ko aashwast karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 loksabhaa main congress ke up netaa ke pad se hathaaye jane kii khabaron ke bich punjab ke purv mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne shuukravaar ko dilli main party adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 In response to a question on his absence in Parliament, he said, 'my mother was ill
 is silsile main maine khud congress adhyaksh se baat kii thi or unke kehane par hi main dubai gaya tha
 At the same time, on speculation about leaving the party, he said that he had been the Chief Minister and where could he leave the Congress
 punjab main party ke pradesh adhyaksh pratap singh bajva ko hataane kii maang par capten amarinder ne saaf kaha, 'hamen jeet darj karne ke liye ek majboot netritv chahie
 We cannot win elections led by Bajwa
 ' amarinder guuruuvaar ko hi dubai se laute hai
 Significantly, Captain Amarinder Singh has called a meeting of his supporters and legislators in Patiala to pressure the party high command
 aisi hi ek meeting unhone pichley saal 19 disambar ko bhi bulaai thi jisamen unke 30 se zyada kareebi netaa or kai vidhayak shaamil hue the
 However, his efforts have so far failed
 party sutron kii maane to sonia or rahul, donon hi captain ko teesri baar aajamaane ke mood main nahin hai
 The last two elections were fought under his leadership and both times Congress was disappointed
 2012 main to party ne unhen bataur mukhyamantri pesh kiya tha
 However, in support of his stand, former MP from Ludhiana Manish Tiwari said, 'any reshuffle is a monopoly of the party leadership but there is no doubt that Captain Amarinder is our strongest leader in Punjab
 ' At the same time, State President Pratap Bajwa said, 'captain Amarinder Singh should not cross the Laxman Rekha
 unki congress adhyaksh ke saath jo bhi baat hui, use media ke saamne nahin rakhana chahie tha
 Under his leadership, we lost two elections in a row
 maine kabhi un par sawaal nahin uthaaya
 i will remain the president till Soniaji and Rahul ji trust me
 ' bajva ne kaha, 'main captain amarinder singh se guzarish karunga ki mujh par nishaanaa saadhane ke bajaae vah akali-bijepi sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane main meri madad karen
 ' lagaataar gutbaji se jujh rahi punjab congress main captain or bajva guton main sheet yuddh november se hi garmaya hua he
 In fact, then state president Pratap Singh Bajwa removed Ludhiana (urban) unit president Pawan Dewan from the post on charges of anti-party activities
 dewan ko captain amarinder kaa kareebi man jaataa he
 Many leaders of North Karnataka were demanding Siddaramaiah to contest from a seat in this part of the state
 badami se pehle doctor devraj patil ko tikat diya gaya tha
 The party has announced candidates for all the 224 assembly seats in the state
 isse pehle 15 april ko congress ne 218 ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi jari kii thi
 Being courageous does not depend on strength and environment, for this intention and intention is more important
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jis rajnatik saahas ke saath kashmir main ‘parivaravaadi’ or algaavvaadi logon (sajaad lone) ke saath sarkaar bana lee, vahi himmat bajet main najar kyon nahin ai? kashmir main bijepi ke rajnatik darshan se itar jane kaa faisla jis ichha shakti se niklaa tha, krantikari sudhaaron bhare bajet ke liye thik aise hi sankalp kii darkaar thi
 After nine months of the Modi government and the average of very important budgets (rail and general budget), the question now arises whether the government intends to make any major changes in governance or call for big ideas and change only Were the election expenses accumulated? Consumers, farmers, job-seeking youth, companies and foreign rating agencies (fitch, Standard & Poor) are also not complacent about the impact of this budget, simply because it was a scared budget that could be taken away from anything new and bigger
 Has been stalled and left feeling of stagnation and cheating
 railway va aam bajet main kya mila, yah sabko pataa he
 But it would be better to know what could have happened that would have transformed them into the most transformative budgets since 1991
 bijepi ne jis thasak ke saath jharkhand main dal badal ke jariye sarkaar bana lee, lagbhag usee tarah ke rajnatik saahas ke aadhaar par suresh prabhu yah elaan kar sakate the ki railway ab sirf rail chalaaegi
 It is not the job of the railways to fill bottles of Rail Neer, make wheels-sleepers, build engine-compartments
 in kaarkaanon main sarkaar kaa hissaa bechakar mili sansadhano ko rail network main lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 It could have been the Make in India of the railway
 railway ko is tarah ke big idia kii hi jarurat thi jo ekamusth badlaav kii raah kholta
 Now if the railway remains intact after one year, it will not surprise you, because 8 in five years for the rail network
 5 lakh karod ru
 Where they will come from, even 'lord' cannot tell it
 jis jid ke saath bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon par rajnatik karavat badali gai, thik vaisaa hi saahas khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh kholane ke faisle par kyon nahin dikhaaya ja saktaa? sarkaar ke bheetar yah sab ko maaloom he ki 2018 tak kareeb 950 arab dollar par pahunchane vaala desh kaa khudara bazaar rojgaar kaa sabase bada jariya ho saktaa he
 This 'trade in India' has hidden possibilities for all sectors including agriculture, which is comparable to the increased consumer spending with cash transfers
 khudara main videshi nivesh ko lekar bijepi ko sirf apane swadeshi kunbe ko manaanaa tha, jo bhoomi adhigrahan kii contili raah se zyada aasaan hota
 If the Prime Minister, who advised the government to go out of business and govern, could not announce the disinvestment of companies like Air India, Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Insurance Corporation, then this is just a sample of weak will power
 bajet ke aankade modi sarkaar se kii gai ummiido kii chugali khate hai
 Unlike the rebuke of arms on freebies, the non-petro subsidy bill remains in the budget
 sarkaar unheen puraani saamaajik suraksha skiimon par laut ai, jinaki vifaltaa pramanik he
 The expenditure has come down on education and health, which is exactly the opposite of Modi's 'mann Ki Baat' for the general public
 rajyon ko sansadhano ke hastantaran ke nae model se sahamat hone ke liye sadhuwaad, alabatta vitt ayog kii siforishein is badlaav kaa jariya bani hai jinhen koi bhi sarkaar sweekaar karti
 If companies and foreign agencies are not able to meet the budget despite the concessions, then the reason is that modi-arun Jaitley came promising the next phase of economic reforms, not a provisional and Qatyabyant budget
 modi-jetali ko yah yaad rakhana hoga ki tukdon-tukdon main badlaavon par shaq-shubahe hote hai lekin bade va ekamusth sudhaar sarkaar ko saahsee sabit karte hai
 Accepting UPA government's direct cash transfer or Aadhaar schemes is a proof of generosity, but not being able to move beyond this is also proof that the new government could not muster more courage to improve the status quo
 yahi vajah he ki bajet kii saamaajik skiimon ke amal par thik vaise hi shaq hai jaise ki upie ke saath the or bajet ke aankadon main thik vaisaa hi locha he jaisaa ki hameshaa se hota aayaa he
 It is not a worry that the budget is average but it is a disappointment that the new and great idea that the Modi government had come to power, it could not be seen anywhere in nine months
 pichley saal disambar main hamane is stambh main likhaa tha ki sarkaron ko hameshaa ulti taraf se dekhnaa behatar hota he, kyonki paanch saal kaa samay bahut zyada nahin hota
 The Modi government now has only two budgets left
 do keemtee bajet yun hi guzar gaye
 The government's agenda should have come in the July budget and the action plan in this budget
 2016 ke bajet main sudhaaron kaa asar aank kar santulan kii koshish hoti or 2017 main nae kadam uthaae jane chahie the kyonki 2018 kaa bajet chunavi hoga or 2019 kaa bajet nai sarkaar pesh karegi
 People did not associate with the Modi government instead of breaking the stars
 ummid sirf yahi thi ki kaarobaar or jindagi kii surat badalani chahie
 Now there is no time to do too much by wishing because the next two budgets will just pass as soon as the mistakes are rectified
