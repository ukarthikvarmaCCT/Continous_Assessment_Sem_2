 ? During the Lok sabha Election, the Election Commission has denied the reports of votes being sent to the BJP by pressing any button on poor Masheel
 goa chunaav ayog (election Commission Goa) ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki is tarah kii khabare logon ko gumraah karne ke liye prachaarit kii ja rahi hai, jabaki is tarah kii koi baat nahin he
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, there were reports that the vote was going to BJP on pressing any button in the EVM which was found bad in South Goa Lok Sabha seat
 goa ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari kunal ne shuukravaar ko press ko bayaan jari kar kaha ki aisi khabaren juthi, gumraah karne vaali or tathyaatmak rup se galat hai
 Kunal issued a statement stating that it is clarified that the allegation of 17 votes going to a BJP candidate during a proxy machine by a spoiled machine is completely false, misleading and factually incorrect
 asal main, chhadam matdaan main 17 vot bhartiya rashtriya congress ke pratyaashee cosmo francisco kaitano sardinha ko gaye the
 He said evms and VVPAT machines were replaced immediately and voting was done with the new equipment reserved
 yah mudda dakshin goa loksabhaa seat ke aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar elvis gomes ne uthaaya tha
 Two seats in the state were voted on April 23
 gauratlab he ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab iviem ko lekar is tarah ke sawaal khadey hue hon
 Earlier, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav had alleged that evms all over India are either messed up or voting in favor of BJP
 akhilesh nechunaav ayogko tag karte hue twit kiya tha ki puure bharat main iviem :electranik voting mashin: yaa to kharaab hai yaa phirbhajapaake liye vot kar rahi hai
 He had said that the District Magistrate says that the Returning Officers are not trained in terms of EVM operations
 saade teen sau se adhik iviem badali ja rahi hai
 The SP chief had said that it is criminal negligence in terms of electoral process, that electoral process, on which 50 thousand crore rupees are being spent
 uttar pradesh main das siton ke liye tisare charan ke tahat aaj matdaan ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party had accused evms of disturbances during the mock poll in Goa
 kaha thaki mock pole ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki vot bijepi ko transfar ho rahe hai
 Regarding this, Delhi Chief Minister and party convenor Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted and asked whether EVM is really bad or whether such programs are set in the machine
 in aaropon ke beej goa ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari ne jaanch kiye jane kii baat kahi thi
 Actually, Aam Aadmi Party convenor in Goa, Ilvis Gomes, had questioned the mock polling on Tuesday by tweeting
 unhone twit kar ise shame kaa chunaav kehete hue aarope lagaaya ki mock poling ke dauraan sabase zyada 17 vot bijepi ko, congress ko nau or aam aadmi party ko aath vot mili the
 In his tweet, he tagged the Election Commission of India spokesperson, Chief Electoral Officer of Goa and Aam Aadmi Party
 unke twit par goa ke nirvachan adhikari ke twitor handle se jawaab diya gaya- ham maamle kii jaanch kar rahe the
 Updates will be released
 is twit par dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki goa main 'doshapurn' iviem bhi anya voton ko bijepi main sthanantarit karti he
 Are these really faulty or programmed in this way

 jab unase poocha gaya ki sarkaar dekh lakh rupye karj maaf kar rahi he to unhone kaha ki dedh lakh kii karj mukti kii jo sharten hai wo hamen maanya nahin hai
 Taking an aggressive stance, he said, "seeing what the BJP said in the manifesto at the time of the 2014 elections is not fulfilling, we have given an affidavit to the Supreme Court in 2015 stating that we cannot fulfill the promises given in the manifesto
" "jab unase poocha gaya ki jin kisaanon ne karj kaa bhugtan kiya he unka kya? to unhone jawaab dete hue kaha, "jin kisaanon ne eemaandaaree se karj kaa bhugtan kiya he unhen sarkaar ko unke karj kii raashi kaa 10 pratishat waapas dena chahie
 Commenting on Venkaiah Naidu's statement 'farmers' debt-free fashion', Prithviraj Chavan said, "venkaiah Naidu should first clarify what Narendra Modi has told him to say?" Or did he say this to Narendra Modi

 Former batsman VVS Laxman believes that tampering with Team India's support staff is not a viable option and the newly appointed team director Ravi Shastri and coach Duncan Fletcher should stay on until the 2015 World Cup
 test shrunkhlaa main england se bharat ko mili 1-3 kii karaari shikast ke baad sahyogi staff main amul chul badlaav kiya gaya
 While Shastri was made the team director, former Indian fast bowler Bharat Arun, former Indian all-rounder Sanjay Bangar and r Sridhar were also given the responsibility in place of bowling coach Joe Dawes and fielding consultant Trevor Penny
 lakshmana ne kaha ki maujuuda koching ikai ke saath bane rahanaa chahie
 Laxman, who has been the backbone of the Indian Test team's middle order for many years, said, "I am hoping that the BCCI will stand by this support staff till the World Cup, which we have for odis
" yah toornament keval chah maheene dur he isliye baahar karne or badlaav karne kaa samay nahin he
 He said, i worked with Ravi Shastri in 2007, when we toured Bangladesh and he is a very positive person, he knows a lot about the game, he was a great leader for Mumbai and he did a Test in India
 It was the captaincy in which India registered a resounding victory
 dancan flechar ko bataur mukhya coach vishwa cap tak bane rahanaa chahie
 Laxman said, i am happy that Bharat Arun and r Sridhar got a chance to coach at a high level, because they have a great record at India (A) and under-19 level

 The Hyderabad batsman was of the opinion that Rohit Sharma should open the innings during the defense of the team title in the next year's 50-over World Cup as Australia's conditions are quite favorable for them
 england ke khilaaf duusare vanade main ek pachaasa banane ke baad rohit ko anguli kii chot ke kaaran baahar kar diya tha or anjiky rahane ko salaami ballebaaj ke taur par utaara gaya tha jinhone maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaate hue chauthe vanade main ek shatak jadaa
 However Laxman Neck said that Rohit is the right person to start the innings and he should maintain it
 is stylish ballebaaj ne kaha, australia ke wicket unke (rohit) mufid honge
 The ODI series was a success for him in 2007, when he was young and non-experienced
 uski ballebaaji kii style australian halaat ke anukool he isliye main nishchit rup se rohit kaa samarthan karuunga or rahane ko ‘back ap’ ke taur par rakhuunga, lekin use madhyakram main khilaaungaa
 Laxman believes that India needs to focus on two key areas to improve their limited overs performance, one is bowling in the last over and the other is the opening pair
 hyderabad ke is 39 varshiya khilaadi ne kaha, twanti20 match main unhone antim teen overon main 50 ran de die, jo kaaphi hai isliye mujhe lagata he ki ye do mudde ek samasya he
 And at the same time, the way India starts their batting will be important because two new balls and conditions will suit the fast bowlers
 unhone kaha, bharat bhaagyashaalee he ki vah vishwa cap se pehle ek trikoniya shrunkhlaa khel rahaa he or vah bhi australia ke khilaaf uski sarajameen par
 It will be a good experience for the players to adjust to the situation
 lakshmana ne suresh raina kii tarifon ke pul baandhte hue kaha, vah kaaphi ahm khilaadi he, kyonki vah keval acha ballebaaj hi nahin he, balki behtareen kshetrarakshak he jo maidan par puri team kaa utsaah badhaata he
 He is also a useful bowler who has the ability to take wickets at crucial moments
 unhone aalochanaon main ghire viraat kohli kaa bhi samarthan kiya jo kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai
 Laxman said, it is good that he got a break before the series against the West Indies, he is not even a part of the Champions League
 or yah samay use batayega ki kya hua or vah majboot vaapasi karegaa
 He said, he is a very hard working young cricketer and i am confident that he will come back
 yah sirf samay kii baat he, vah phir se vaise hi ran bananaa shuru kar degaa, jaisaa vah pichley kuch varshon main karata tha

 vahiin, sambhav he ki dopaher 2:30 baje tak adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa nahin hone par ayog is sambandh main raashtrapati se shikaayat kare
 Significantly, on Monday, the election authorities in the state, after taking major action, got five officers removed from election duty and issued orders to transfer them within twenty-four hours from the Chief Secretary
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ayog ke is kadam se naaraaz ho gayi or unhone ayog ke aadesh ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 According to the latest information, despite the deadline for the transfer within 24 hours from the Commission, if the Chief Secretary Sanjay Mitra does not transfer the officials, the Commission can complain to the President through the Secretary to the Central Government
 bataaya jaataa he ki ayog raashtrapati se apni shikaayat main sanjay mitra kii ore se aadesh kaa paalan nahin karne ke babat karrwai kii maang bhi kar saktaa he
 The commission had issued a transfer order on Monday at 2:30 pm

 He challenged the election panel to take action against him and said that he is ready to be arrested and go to jail

 saath hi aadesh diya ki rajya sarkaar ayog ko aavashyak soochna dekar, hataae gaye adhikariyon ko gaiyr chunaav sambandhi padon main niyukti de sakati he
 On the other hand, the opposition has also strongly criticized this attitude of Mamata Banerjee
 jabaki mukhyamantri ne kaha ki agar chunaav ayog kanoon or vyavastha ko niyantrit karata he to unhen koi aapatti nahin he, lekin agar koi samasya hoti he to mamata banerjee par dosha mat madhie
 Either Mamata Banerjee will look into law and order or Election Commission will look into law and order
 congress kii dayaa se nahin pai he sattamamata ne kaha ki vah ayog yaa congress kii dayaa par satta main nahin ai hai or vah is babat ayog ko chunauti detii hai
 Mamta said, 'you go and take any step in Narendra Modi's state or at the place from where Sonia Gandhi is contesting elections
 iske baad aap ham par haath rakhen
 What will you do to me? At most i will be arrested and sent to jail

The US has been continuously pressurizing India over stringent IPR laws

 The government says that this policy will encourage new discoveries and inventions, but experts doing research on WTO are not convinced

 Yet in September 2014, after the formation of the new government, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave a statement that the government will bring a new policy in the matter of IPR within 6 months

 Habib said that people should celebrate their heritage as father of the nation
 87 varshiya habib ne yah baaten itihaaskaar, vidwaanon, kalakaaron, chaatro ko sambodhit karte hue ek kaarykram main boli
 Citing the use of Gandhiji's picture in the Swachh Bharat Mission, Habib said that today, the Modi government of the country is treating the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi like a senior sanitation inspector
 mere khyaal se is vakt hamen rashtrapita ke taur par unki viraasat kaa jashn manaanaa chahie

 Earlier in his address, the author of 'people's History of India' spoke on the idea of nationalism and Gandhi and said that the concept of nation is different from the country
 unhone kaha ki ek desh tab ek raashtra banataa he tab ise raajnneetik ikai ke rup main banane ke gambhir prayaas kiye jate hai
 He said that India had learned nationalism during the struggle for independence in colonial times and not from some ancient texts like some right wing organizations want to convince us

 The historian requested the people to celebrate on 13 January in a big way, on which is the anniversary of Gandhiji's fast unto death
 iske dinon baad gandhi ji kii dilli main hatya kar di gai thi
 Habib said that Muslim women had broken bangles in their hands after hearing the news of her murder in Pakistan

 Build Quality & Design: janvari main mahinda rajpakshe srilanka ke raashtrapati pad par lagaataar teesri baar jeet darj karne kii muhim main haare to satta saunpane ko taiyaar ho gaye or chupchaap apane sarkari awaas ko khaali kar diya
 a week later, he handed over the leadership of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and its largest ally Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to his successor Maithripal Sirisena
 lekin 13 july ko yah bhram tut gaya ki 69 varshiya rajpakshe haar ke baad raajnneeti ko bade adab ke saath alavida kah denge
 He has filed a contest to contest from UPFA in the upcoming general elections
 srilanka ke itihaas main pehali baar aisa hoga ki koi purv raashtrapati sansad main pravesh karne kaa icchhuk ho
 About 51
 28 fisadi vot hasil karke satta main aae raashtrapati sirisena apane dhur virdohi kii ummidavaari par jamkar barase
 In his televised address on 14 July, he said, "mahinda Rajapaksa lost on 8 January and would lose again
 ” unhone 17 agast ke chunaavon ke liye upiene ke paksh main prachaar na karne kaa bhi elaan kiya
 The reasons for his sudden burst are in the internal struggle going on for seven months
 november, 2014 main chupchaap kaam karne vaale sinhalai 64 varshiya sirisena sarkaar se alag ho gaye or raashtrapati pad ke liye madhyavadhi chunaavon main taqatvar rajpakshe ko chunauti dene utar gaye
 In 2009, Rajapaksa became dictator following the annihilation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and crushed all forms of opposition
 sirisena ko mukhya vipakshi dal united neshnal party (yuanpi) or 40 se adhik duusare rajnatik samoohon kaa samarthan hasil he
 Minority Tamils and Muslims had turned in their favor
 par rajpakshe ne chunavi nateezon ko chunauti nahin di
 He returned to his village Tangali on the southern coast
 chunaav nateezon kii raat sainya takhtapalat kii koshish kii afvaahon kii abhi pushti nahin hui he
 But the relief from Rajapaksa was short lived
 haal main raashtrapati sirisena ne kabuula ki purv raashtrapati kii dakhsandaji se unhen mahatvapurn sudhaaron par amal karne main kaaphi pareshaani jhelni pad rahi he
 He said, "mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the chair of the party to me, but shortly after he became noticed and started pulling my leg
 ” takaraav is kadar bad gaya ki sansadeey kaamkaaj avaruddh hone laga
 The problem was further compounded by the peculiar conditions of the Sirisena government alliance
 vipaksh ke saath chunavi samjhaute ke tahat unhone yuanpi netaa ranil vikramsinghe ko pradhanmantri bana diya
 He formed an interim government of just 47 mps in a House of 225 mps
 is kamjor-si sarkaar ko vaadon kii lambii-chaudee fehrist sau dinon main puri kerani thi
 Sirisena got some initial success in this
 sansad main bahumat rakhane vaale upiene ne us loklubhaavan bajet ko paas hone diya jisamen keemton main katautee or saarvajanik upakramon main vetan badhotaree kii gai
 But Rajapaksa's interference from behind the scenes caused obstacles in the path of further reforms
 raashtrapati ke kaaryakari adhikaron main katautee se sambandhit sanvaidhanik sanshodhan ko upiene kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye dhilaa kiya gaya
 It passed the mandatory two-thirds majority in April but the proposal to raise the domestic debt limit could not be passed in the same month
 inhen samikarnon kii vajah se prastaavit chunaav sudhaar bhi latak gaye
 The Right to Information Bill and the National Audit Bill were promised to curb corruption but could not be tabled in Parliament
 sarkaar rajpakshe or unki khaas mandali ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa mukadmaa chalaane main bhi naakaam rahi
 Sirisena remained engaged in the UPFA campaign to bring Rajapaksa to power for months
 unhone apane mantrimandal main rajpakshe ke vishwaasapatro ko is ummid main liya ki ve unka samarthan hasil kar sakenge, lekin koi laabh nahin hua
 Then, considering the possibility of a no-confidence motion being brought against Wickremesinghe, the President dissolved Parliament on 26 June and announced mid-term elections
 uske kuch hi dinon baad upiene ne elaan kiya ki rajpakshe chunaav ladenge
 Rajapaksa has chosen a seat in Kurunegala district in the north-west
 ve pehali baar dakshin main apni paramparaagat seat hambantota se nahin lard rahe
 There is a political reason for this
 kurunegala main sinhalai baudhon kii bahulata he or yahaan faujee pariwaron kii baari aabaadi he
 They are also popular among voters and can win by a huge margin from there
 haalanki rajpakshe ke liye sarkaar bananaa is par nirbhar karegaa ki upiene ke duusare ummidavaar kitni badi sankhya main jeet kar aate hai
 Their basic strategy will be to create a bogey for the LTTE, but it will also try to provoke sentiments that UNP is going to create a separate autonomous region for Tamils under Sirisena
 bharat samet videshi sarkaron par aarope lagaaya jayega ki ve rajpakshe ko haraane kii muhim main jute hai
 The UNP is entering a new alliance with the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) in these elections
 isamen 12 july ko shaamil dalon main sinhal nesanalist jatika hela urumaya (jeechayu) bhi he, jo rajpakshe ke chunaav main utarane ke baad upiene se alag ho gai he
 This party, claiming to be its own members of Buddhist ascetics, is associated with the right-wing UNP for the first time
 jeechayu ne eenefjiji ke duusare sahyogi srilanka muslim congress se apane lambey samay se matbhedon ko bhi pehali baar bhula diya he
 Wickramasinghe will once again raise issues of corruption, nepotism and repression under Rajapaksa's rule
 lekin unki sarkaar ke pichley chah maheenon ke lachar pradarshan se matadaataaon kaa bharosa dig saktaa he
 Then, the Prime Minister himself is surrounded by controversies
 un par aarope he ki unhone kendriya bank ke governor kaa brands nilaamee ke gadabadjhaale main bachaav kiya
 The governor reportedly did this to benefit his close relatives
 rajpakshe ke liye pradhanmantri kaa pad ahm he
 For Rajapaksa, who remained in the mainstream of politics for four decades, and who has exercised his executive powers as president, it can be humiliating to remain a general MP
 haalanki unki raah kaa sabase bada roda raashtrapati khud hai jinka rajnatik anubhav unase unniis nahin he
 Sirisena said on July 14, "even if UPFA wins the election, there are many senior leaders in the SLFP and allies besides Mahinda Rajapaksa who can be made the Prime Minister
 ” haalanki raashtrapati kaa apane hi party kaadaron main utana samarthan nahin he kyonki unhen vipakshi yuanpi kii sarkaar banane vaala mana jaataa he
 The battle lines have been drawn after months of uncertainty
 sansad 1 sitambar ko baithni he
 In the meantime, there will be manipulations and buy-outs from both sides until the election results are in place as it is important to form a government for both camps
 philhal yahi lagata he ki raashtrapati sirisena ke prachaar se baahar rahane ke kaaran nattejey kisi bhi ore jhuk sakate hai

 jharkhand se bacchon ko laakar noida main unase chori karwaai ja rahi he
 In the last 4 years, about 15 such children were caught in Noida and the biggest disclosure is that all these children are from three villages in the same district of Jharkhand, but the police have not yet caught any crime leading the children to the world of crime
 Could
 dekhie aise bacchon par enditivi kii exclusive report
 In an attempt to steal the woman's purse, on December 12, 2014, a child recovered from Noida, Sector-20, said that my grandmother said, "come on
" paise kii jarurat thi
 We are two brothers and a sister
 pita kii maut ho chuki he
 Nani said that he will get some work done in Delhi
 dukaan main laga denge to maine bolaa thik he
 She brought me training here, stealing purse and running away
 sawaal- training di aapako? Child - Yes, one month training sawaal- kaise kya karte the? Baby - getting behind the ladies and running away from the purse sawaal-ye nani koun he 
 
 iskaa naam kya he 
 
 kya ye aapaki apni nani he? The child is not his grandmother, the grandmother's name is Sonavati sawaal-ye kahaan mili aapako ? Child in the village sawaal-gaanv main pehali baar aayi thi yaa iske pehle bhi dekha tha ? Baby-saw for the first time sawaal-isane aapke maa-baap se baat kii thi yaa khud baat kar lee thi ? The child talked to me and i ran sawaal-gaanv se kaise laai aapako ? The child was brought by train and brought down Old Delhi mahila kaa phone chori karne kii koshish main 20 janvari, 2015 ko noida sector-20 se baraamad bachche ne bataaya ki Sunil brought it
 bol rahaa tha chalo ghumaayenge
 After coming here, he said that he would work for 2-3 days for theft
 
 
 hamane bolaa nahin karenge
 Say that there is no money
 kaise jaaenge gaanv, phone bechenge
 
 
 Question - Do you already know Sunil? baccha-wo meri mummy ko jaanata he The question — and how many children it has brought
 
 How many children does she have? baccha-2-3 lekar aayaa tha, waapas gaanv pahunchaa diya? Question - Steals all children? baccha-haa Question- Does one get beaten up for not stealing? baccha-haa Question- How many times did you steal? baccha-ek baar Question - What were you stealing? baccha-phone Question- Whose phone were you stealing? baccha-mem kaa Question- So people caught you there? baccha-haa Your question? baccha-haa Noida, the city of dreams, skyrocketing buildings, surrounded by magnificent malls and shops, the crowded Sector 18's Atta Market
 isi chakachaundh main 8-15 saal ke kuch bachche chori or jhapatmari ke pantare aajamaate hai
 
 or kisi kii palak jhapai nahin ki purse or mobile uda le jate hai kai baar kaamyaab hote hai to kai baar kismat dagaa de jaati he Childline convenor Satprakash told that from 2011 to 2015 our experience came out that where there are malls around Sector-20, small children who are around 10-16 years old are being caught stealing
 And theft is also like small theft of mobile purse
 ab tak hamaare saamne aise kareeb 15 maamle saamne aae hai or sabase badi baat ye he ki ye sabhi bachche jharkhand ke ek hi jile sahibganj ke ek hi gaanv maharajaganj se hai
 In such a situation, it is obvious that a big gang that brings children from the same place to the theft business is very active and big
 bachapan ke un saudagaron main se kuch ke naam to ye bachche bhi aapako bataa denge
 According to Childline, as soon as the children are caught in a crime, the calls from the brokers start
 kabhi koi nani banakar yaad karne lagata he to koi chachaa banakar baat karata he
 Not only this, they also offer money to redeem the children
 itnaa hi nahin childline ko khatre kaa puraa ahsaas tab hota he jab khabar dene ke baad bacchon ke garib or anpadh maa-baap vahaan se puure dastavej or pakki taiyaari kar yahaan aata he, jinhen dekhakar pehali najar main hi lag jaataa he ki unhen har tarah kii kanoonee madad dallalon kii taraf se muhaiyaa karai gai hogi taaki bacchon ko chhudaa kar dobaaraa usee dhandhe main laga saken
 For example, on December 12 last year, a woman arrived to take the captured child
 khud ko maa bataane vaali is mahila ke paas gram panchayat kaa certificate or bachche ke saath apni cat paste kii tasviir bhi thi
 Childline convenor Satprakash said that the child welfare committee should conduct a domestic inquiry with the CWC before handing over the parents to the children, who are not following this
 ab tak hamaare paas jo 15 maamle saamne aae hai
 In none of the cases did the CWC conduct a home study to find out why their children were coming to Noida
 records ke mutabik, ek baccha ek hi pattern par chori karte do baar pakadaa gaya
 According to Child Line, no FIR is made against the first time children caught
 aise bachche child and protection kii category main aate hai
 The police makes a DD entry and the children are handed over to their family members before presenting them to the Child Welfare Committee
 childline ne 2013 main noida ke esaspi se bacchon ko jurm main dhakelne vaale giroh par karrwai kii baat kahi, But the police or the CWC remained silent, now NDTV is talking about strict action by the police
 noida kii krime branch kii espi sunita singh ne ye to sahi he, bachche mili hai
 Children were also handover to families
 ab ham ye pataa laga rahe hai ki bacchon ko laayaa koun, koi na koi vyakti, ham us vyakti kii khoj kar rahe hai or jis din vah vyakti mil jayega uske khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Actually the culprits are not these children but those people who instill such thinking in children
 unhen is daldal main dhakelte hai
 These are the real players pushing children into the world of crime
 kuch isi shahar main to kuch is shahar ke aasapaas ke shaharon main, lekin inhen pakadaney main kisi ko koi dilchaspee nahin

 i have been a fan of her since childhood, whenever the camera is on, i have found her only as a character
 or camera of hote hi main kone main jaakar baith jaati thi
 He is an excellent actor
 mujhe yakeen hi nahin hota ki ek hi actor 5-7 alag alag kirdaar kaise nibhaa saktaa he, isiilie amit ji hameshaa aapako sarprise karte hai
 How correct is the use of 'galali' in films? i also abused 'ishqiyaan'
 rosemara kii jindagi main aksar gaaliyon kaa istemaal hota he
 If the story is based on real events and is true to the character, then abusing in dialogs is not wrong
 box offis kitna myne rakhata he?box offis se pataa chalata he ki zyada se zyada logon ne yah film dekhi he
 You cannot control the box office numbers
 agar sara dhyaan box offis par hi rahegaa, to kaam karne main mushkil hoti he
 Do you always want to play the lead role? It is not so, if the script is good, then there should be any co-actor in front, it is fun to do the film
 lekin aajkal diarectors pehle apane man main bana lete hai ki vidya ko ye script acchhee nahin lagegi, are ek baar mujh tak script lekar to aaiye, mujhe padhane kaa mauka to dijiye

 Will you and Siddharth work together in a film that they produce? Our effort is not to work with each other
 ye hamaari marid life ke liye acchhee baat he
 i have also left many such films but it would not be right to name them
 jivan kii film ke liye aisa tyaag dena bahut jaruri he
 Siddharth and i do not mix our personal and professional lives, otherwise nothing will be able to be different at home and office
 aap kamala das kii byopic kar rahi hai?ji, main unke bare main bahut kuch jaananaa chaahati thi
 She is very progressive lady, that's why i said yes to her biopic

 This is the same brigade parade ground where Mamata Trinamool Congress leader and West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee rallied with 22 opposition parties on January 19 and challenged that if there is strength, Modi should show this spirit
 bijepi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii raily us maidan main karne kii koshish bhi kii thi, lekin rajya sarkaar ne kathith rup se parmishan nahin di thi

 vidhansabha chunaav 2016 main bhale hi party kaa vot 10 fisadi rahaa tha, lekin rajya kii 75 fisad se adhik siton par bijepi duusare number par thi

 The party could not move ahead of the TMC, but in many places, defeating the Congress and CPM, became the No

 The attackers have been seeing the political ambitions of mamta-bjp, CM Mamata Banerjee is constantly attacking PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 mamata banerjee sibiai, rashtriya suraksha, aatankwaad, pakistan ke mudde ko lekar narendra modi sarkaar par kade prahaar karti rahi hai
 On March 5, Mamta had said that the Central Government wants to win the election on the strength of the martyrdom of the soldiers
 isse pehle mamata banerjee ne balakot air strike par gheraa tha or kaha tha ki vipaksh hone ke naate piem ko unhen oparation puri jaankaree deni chahie thi or bataanaa chahie tha ki kahaan bam giraae gaye, kitne log usamen maare gaye
 In February this year, Mamata Banerjee declared a political battle for the Central Government when she sat on a dharna in Kolkata against the CBI raid on the then Police Commissioner of Kolkata
 mamata ne tab kaha tha ki narendra modi or amit shah rajya main takhtapalat kii sajeesh kar rahe hai
 Mamta Banerjee has also attacked Narendra Modi on the issue of demonetisation
 lakhanu main akhilesh ke saath yojit ek raily main unhone kaha tha ki piem modi danga karavaate hai or ve hitler se bhi bade taanashaah hai
 Mamta had said that she has created an emergency-like atmosphere by implementing demonetisation
 piem modi kaa palatwarpradhanmantri narendra modi bhi apni hi style main mamata ke hamale kaa jawaab dete rahe hai
 Addressing a rally in West Bengal on February 2, the PM had said that Mamta Banerjee was scared to see the love of the people of West Bengal towards her
 piem ne kaha tha ki ve ab samaj sakate hai ki kyon unki party hinsa par utaaru ho gai he or nirdosh logon ko maar rahi he
 Party president Amit Shah had earlier surrounded the West Bengal government and asked why the people of West Bengal do not have the freedom to celebrate Saraswati Puja

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen, after conducting a social and cultural analysis of the politics of Jai Shri Ram and Jai Maa Durga Wali in Bengal, has concluded that the bjp's slogan of Jai Shri Ram does not stand in front of the victory of Mother Durga in Bengal
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir wo koun se halaat hai, jinaki vajah se ek nobel puraskaar vijeta arthshaastri ko shriram or maa durga ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan karne kaa idia aayaa
 Amartya Sen, a fan of Maa Durga, more than Shri Ram said, i believe the slogan of Jai Shri Ram has nothing to do with Bengali culture
 kolkata kii jadhavpur uniwarsity ke chaatro ko raajnneetishastra kii class dete nobel puraskaar vijeta arthshaastri amartya sen ke vichaar se bengal kii samskruti main shriram kii koi zyada puch nahin he
 Mum Durga has more fan following than Shriram
 amartya sen ne is nattejey par pahunchane ke liye bengal kii samskruti par apni chaar saal kii potee ke saath gahan chintan kiya he
 Amartya Sen, the echo of Jai Shri Ram and Jai Maa Durga in Bengal, asked her four-year-old granddaughter who her favorite god is? He replied, Mother Durga
 unhone kaha ki maa durga hamaari (bengali samudaay) jindagi main sarvyaapee hai
 The importance of Maa Durga cannot be compared to Rama Navami
 maa durga or shriram kii fain folowing kii tulanaatmak adhyayan karne kaa idia amartya sen ke saanskrithik dimag kii upaj nahin he balki unke ye vichaar puri tarah bengal kii maujuuda siyasat se prerit lagate hai
 In which only two slogans are echoed, one is Jai Shri Ram and the other is Jai Maa Durga
 ek taraf bhartiya janata party (bijepi) bengal main jai shriram ke sahare apni jameen majboot kar rahi he, to duusari taraf mamata banerjee ne shriram ke khilaaf maa durga ko bengal ke siyaasi yuddh main utaara he
 Regarding which, before the Lok Sabha elections, during the elections and even after the elections, there has been a ruckus in the politics of Bengal from the roads
 amartya sen or mamata banerjee ke ek jaise vichaarjaahir he ki amartya sen ke vichaar bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke vichaaron se match karte hai, kyonki bijepi ke jai shriram kaa saamana trinmul congress (tiemasi) jai maa durga ke naare se hi kar rahi he
 Political analysts say that Amartya Sen did not compare the slogans of Jai Shri Ram and Maa Durga but that of BJP and TMC
 jai shriram ke naare par bijepi-tiemasi aamane-samanimartya sen ke in vichaaron se bijepi ne naaraazgi jaahir kii
 TMC and BJP are already face to face with the slogan of Jai Shri Ram in Bengal
 ab amartya sen ne is vivaad main kudakar vivaad ko badhaane kii koshish kii he
 In Bengal, BJP too does not desist from teasing Mamata Banerjee with slogans of Jai Shri Ram
 mamata jahaan bhi jaati hai, bijepi kaaryakarta vahaan jai shriram ke naare lagaate hue pahunch jate hai
 a similar incident took place in North 24 Parganas on May 30 when some people raised slogans of Jai Shri Ram on seeing Mamata Banerjee's convoy
 jiske baad mamata itnaa chidh gayi ki apni car se utarkar naare lagane waalon par gussa utaarne lageen
 BJP accusations - India has forgotten the cultural ethos of Senjay Sri Ram slogan has no historical connection with Bengali culture
 sen ke is vichaar kii aalochana karte hue bijepi ne kaha ki arthshaastri sen bhartiya saanskrithik lokchaar se cat gaye hai, kyonki vah zyaadaatar videshon main rahete hai
 Forgetting the country's traditions due to being abroad, senbjp state unit president Dilip Ghosh said, "sen mostly lives abroad
" bharat ke logon ke prati unka koi judaav yaa yogadan nahin he, unke bhaashanon kaa koi parvaah nahin karata
 Those who depend on them are over
 vahiin bijepi ke ek anya netaa mukul roy ne kaha ki jai shriram naaraa achche shashan kaa pratik he
 He said that Sen has certainly forgotten the traditions of the country due to his being abroad for many years
 gauratlab he ki sen ne jadavapur vishvavidhyalay main shuukravaar ko ek saarvajanik sabha main kaha tha ki unhone is tareeke se jai shri ram nahin suna he
 He said that this slogan is now being used while beating people
 sen ne kaha tha ki bengali samskruti se is naare kaa koi judaav nahin he

 1947 main desh kii aazaadee ke baad satta ke kendra par baithi congress lambey samay tak desh kii sabase badi party bani rahi
 Then the Bharatiya Janata Party, formed in 1980 from the Bharatiya Jana Sangh formed by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951, is today the largest party in the country
 loksabhaa main purna bahumat ke saath party desh ke kai rajyon kii satta par kabiz he
 Many such facts are recorded in this 37-year history of the BJP, which has brought this party which stood in response to the Congress to the center of power in 4 decades
 aaie jaanate hai aisi kuch baaten jo maujuuda samay main deshbhar main bijepi ke samarthak or bhakton ko jaananaa jaruri he
 It is also important to know these things because these things made the BJP stand apart from the Congress and today in the rise of BJP, the Congress is fighting to save its existence
 1
 The foundation of the BJP was formed on 6 April 1980 in 1951, separated from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, formed by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 congress main parivaarwaad or vyapak bhrashtachar ke jawaab main yah party astitv main ai or atal bihari bajpei or laal krishna adwani iske founder member rahe
 2
 bijepi kaa chunaav chinh camel kaa phool he jiske kai myne hai
 Most importantly, the BJP uses this symbol to show its national character
 is chinh ko bijepi akhand bharat kii apni pariklpana ke saath bhi jodate hue maa saraswati kaa rup maanati he jo shiksha or prashikshan kaa pratik hai
 3
 bijepi desh ko ek aisa shashakt or khushhaal desh banane ke liye patibaddh he jo naveen, pragatisheel hone ke saath-saath saanskrithik mulyon par aadhaarit ho
 4
 bijepi desh ko ek bahusankhyak shasit rajya banane kii pariklpana par kaam karti he
 a state that gives equal opportunity to all citizens of the country without discrimination
 iske liye vah sabakaa saath or sabakaa vikaas kaa naaraa detii he
 5
 bijepi kii raajnneetik vyavastha ko desh ke prati prem or desh bhakthi ke sahare paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the party considers acts like cow slaughter a crime because the cow is the mother of a Hindu
 haalanki bijepi saamaajik ekta kii baat bhi karti he lekin vahdharmanirpekshataki europea paribhaasha ko nahin maanati he
 The BJP has always given the name of Muslim appeasement to the secularism of the Congress
 6
 The BJP takes a more nationalist stance on the issue of national security and terrorism than the Congress
 iske chalate hi atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne desh ko nabhakeey hathiyaar se las karne ke liye antarrashtriya pratibandhon kii chintaa kiye bagaiyr nabhikeey pareekshan ko puraa kiya
 7
 bijepi aatankwaad ke khilaaf kadaa kanoon banane kii pakshdhar he
 She believes in curbing terrorist activities in the country and keeping the issues of terrorism flourishing in neighboring countries with full force internationally
 8
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had been opposing making special provisions in the Constitution (article 370) for Jammu and Kashmir since the days of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh
 iske chalate jan sangh ke baad bijepi samvidhan se anuchhed 370 ko hataane kii maang karti rahi he
 9
 uniform civil code par bijepi kaa mat he ki desh main sabhi nagarikon ke liye ek samaan adhikaar hone chahie
 The party believes that only after implementing this code, women can be given equal rights in the country
 10
 The BJP took out a rath yatra in 1990 to reach the stage of national politics against the Congress
 somnath se ayodhya tak daude is rath par bijepi ke founder member laal krishna adwani savaar the
 Narendra Modi had full responsibility for the operation of this chariot
 is vakt modi party kii gujarat ikai main mahasachiv prabandhan ke pad par the
 By delivering the chariot safely from Somnath to Ayodhya, Modi had convinced the party of its operational efficiency
 11
 Due to the responsibility of the rath yatra, Narendra Modi used to give official information from the party to the country and international media
 is kirdaar main pehali baar modi ne veepi singh or mulaayam singh yadav tak ko chunauti de daali thi ki unki himmat ho to desh ke kisi kone main rathyatra ko roak kar dikhaaen
 12
 bijepi kii is rathyatra ko vishwa hindu parishad kaa purajor samarthan mila
 Actually, this time Pravin Togadia was the general secretary of VHP Gujarat unit
 togadiya or narendra modi sahyogi prachaarak ke saath-saath achche dost bhi the
 To make the rath yatra work across the country, Togadia took out 101 Ram Jyoti Yatra and 15,000 Vijay Dashami Yatra under the banner of VHP
 13
 The BJP has been a strong supporter of Swadeshi since its inception in 1980
 swadeshi ke mudde par swadeshi jaagran manch kaa sangh parivaar se gaharaa naata he
 The BJP has kept protests on the issue of Swadeshi several times during the tenure of former Congress governments, along with keeping Swadeshi in its manifesto
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki sabhi sabhyataaen apane hunar par viksit hoti he
 Along with this, giving the slogan of India First, BJP is in favor of making the country self-reliant
 14
 The construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya is necessary for the faith of crores of Hindus for the BJP
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki vah is mudde par nyaayalay ke aadesh ko maanegi haalanki uskaa kahana he ki ayodhya main ram mandir banane kaa sabase behatar tarika donon samudaayon ke netaaon kii sahmati he

 Chief ministers of these states are overheated due to the absence of a single district headquarters from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh

 Nitish claimed that whatever paperwork had to be done in this regard, the Bihar government completed it, but by announcing the first 100 smart cities, the central government released a list to make only 20 cities smart
 tippaniyan Although Nitish Kumar admitted that smart city does not make any sense, but he did not look at any of the cities of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 isse pehle 20 shaharon kii soochi aane par bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ne daawa kiya tha ki bihar sarkaar dwaara kagaji karwaai samay par puraa na hone ke kaaran centre sarkaar ne majaburi main ek bhi shahar kaa chayan nahin kiya
 But Nitish Kumar said that it is a dark city and the central government does not take care of the regional balance in its decision

 The comments haalanki nitish kumaar ne mana ki smart city kaa koi matlab nahin hota lekin bihar or uttar pradesh ke ek bhi shahar kaa chayan na hone se wo saafe naaraaz dikhe
 Earlier, when the list of 20 cities came up, the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party had claimed that the central government did not select a single city in compulsion due to the completion of the paperwork by the Bihar government in time
 lekin usapar nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki ye andher nagari he or centre sarkaar apane nirnay main kshetreey santulan kaa khyaal nahin rakhti
 Nitish is definitely upset with the selection criteria
 haalanki bihar ke mukhyamantri ne ab daawa kiya he ki smart gaanv banane kii unki ghoshnaa par kaam shuru ho gaya he
 Therefore his seven determinations include water supply to every household and construction of taps and toilets in the village as a priority of his current government

 Patrick Farhart underwent initial treatment and Dhawan succumbed to ice injury for some time, but the swelling did not decrease and it was then decided that he would have to be scanned
 australia ke khilaaf hue mukaable se pehle dhawan ko toornament main acchhee shuruyaat nahin mili thi, lekin duusare match main unhone damdaar ballebaaji kii
 After the match he had said, 'we are happy with the result because our team put in a great effort
 yah hamaari team ke liye acha sanket he or main is main of da match puraskaar se khush hum
 We are very happy with the overall performance
 'kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki dhawan kii gairmaujuudagi main lokesh rahul bharat ke liye rohit sharma ke saath salaami ballebaaji kii bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 At the same time , the name of Shreyas Iyer, Kedar Jadhav and Rishabh Pant are discussed for batsman at number four 
 koi ganesh hai jinhone fasebuk ke free basics ke trial maatr se itani jaankaree hasil kar lee ki unke kheton kii paidaavaar doguni ho gai! agar aap bharat kii kheti kii taaja dasha se waakif hai to aap duniya kii sabase badi soshal network company ke vigyapanon kii is ganesh katha ko niyam to dur, apwaad bhi nahin maanenge lekin phir itnaa tay he ki fasebuk free basics ke vishaal vigyaapan aapako “kuch to raajnneeti he” vaale sandigdh ehsaas bhare bina nahin chodenge
 Just like Facebook asks for votes to remove poverty and inequality in electoral advertisements, if Facebook appeals to choose its free basics service to remove digital inequality in India, then everything is not normal
 darasal, isse pehle ki ham apane bazaar va udaarikaran ko, sarkari va nijee donon, ekadhikaar se mukt kar pate, ham bazaar kii jatil raajnneeti main lithdane ja rahe hai
 This politics is more complicated and effective than everyday politics because elected governments also get involved in it
 fasebuk ke free basics se judaa sawaal nihaayat basic he
 Someone is calling us at the shopping mall where the entry will be free but in return there will be a discount to pick up the goods only from select shops
 agar puure mal main ghoomana-khaanaa-khareednaa chaahate hai to phir muft entry nahin milegi
 Do we want this? Before we get into the free internet debate, it is important to understand the existing system of Internet
 bharat kii maujuuda niti ke tahat mobile operators ko spectrum mila he jiske tahat sabko samaan rup se internet miltaa he
 The speed at which the data package takes is the same as the Internet
 internet kaa sasta hona jaruri he or iske liye companiyon ko suvidhaayen or riyaayaten milani chahie lekin koi company muft internet ke badale aapako ek simit kshetra main saiyr karana chaahe to yah internet kii us aazaadee ke khilaaf he jo bharat de rahaa he or duniya ke liye adarsh he
 There are three partners in the world of Internet that make it a free world
 fasebuk kaa free basics in teenon ko bigaad degaa
 Mobile operators have created the road to access the Internet i
e
 the telecom network
 jaahir he, fasebuk kaa free basics ek hi company ke network par milegaa yani ki isse oparator ko zyada graahak milenge jisase mobile bazaar kii pratispardhaa bigadegi
 Other partners in this market are media, e-commerce, etc
 Content and service companies
 bharat main internet puri tarah swatantra he
 But Facebook will have the same shop in its market which will be with it
 Third, it is the Internet itself, in which the rule of free but limited access will shake the foundation of its independence
 desh ke sabase bade oparator airtel ne pichley saal airtel jiro sarvice ke tahat kuch website par free internet acces dene kaa prastaav kiya tha iske badale ve website airtel ko paisa dene vaali thim
 The offering was the beginning of the debate on net neutrality in India
 fasebuk free basics jaisi peshkash, pratispardhaa ko poojane vaale pashchim ke bazaaron main kar hi nahin sakati, yah to sirf pichde or vikasshil deshon ko lubhaa sakati he
 Despite this, Egypt stopped the free basics two days ago
 darasal, fasebuk, airtel ke kaarobaari hit mukt bazaar main hi surakshit hai na ki us bazaar main jise ve gadhia chaahati hai
 The monopoly and cartels have already interfered in the Indian market
 fasebuk to apane aakaar, folbers or rasookh ke sahare is asantulan ko majboot karne ja rahaa he
 Even after the license permit raj ended, the Indian market was not fully opened
 agar sarkaar hati to log chuninda companiyon ke bandhua ho gaye
 Our monthly bill payments will tell us how we are giving most of the money to about two dozen companies
 chocolate se lekar mobile tak darjanon utpaada va sevaayen aisi hai jinamein hamaare paas chuninda vikalp hai
 Therefore, there are either monopolies or cartels in their market
 duusari taraf petroleum, railway, koyala, bijli aadi par sarkaar kaa ekadhikaar he isliye donon jagah upabhokta anti compitishan gatividhiyon kaa shikaar ho hota he jabaki inaki tulana main automobile, khaadya utpaada, dawa main pratispardhaa behatar he
 The reforms that India needed were to balance it with opening up the market and the government's role in it is going to be the biggest
 sarkaar ko na keval apane ekadhikaar vaale kshetron se nikalnaa tha balki jin kshetron main nijee cartil ban gaye hai vahaan pratispardhaa badhaani he
 For example, take mobile only where the number of operators going from 2G to 4G is decreasing i
e
 competition is decreasing
 in apekshaaon ke bich jab sarkaar main rah chuke nandan nilkeni jaise visheshgy aadhaar card ke jariye logon ko muft internet dene kii vakaalat karte hai to yah samajhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki aakhir ham sarkari sabsidi kii samaapti kii taraf bad rahe hai yaa nai sabsidi scimen shuru karne kii taraf
 We went through liberalization to create a free market giving opportunity to all
 hamane sochaa tha ki logon kii jindagi va kaarobaar main sarkaar kii bhoomika simit hoti jaaegi lekin congress se bijepi tak aate bharat ke aarthik udaarikaran kaa puraa model hi gaddamdd ho gaya he
 We are facing a new kind of governmentalization and the use of new methods of limiting competition in the market has increased
 pichley saal airtel jiro ke virodh ke baad bharat main net nutrality se khatra tal gaya tha lekin tiri ne is bahes ko phir khol diya he or fasebuk ke kathith ganesh mahange vigyapanon ke jariye kheti main soshal netwarking ke phaayde bataane lage hai
 Of course, the re-opening of this debate cannot be supported by the presence of the Indian Prime Minister on the American platform of Facebook, but if it turns out, it will go away and people will expect Narendra Modi that his government will be an advocate of market freedom Efforts to limit competition will emerge

 That is, scenes have been inserted for Comedy and they do not advance the story
 ab baat kuubiyon kii So there is a lot of news in this and its biggest feature is its comedy which has to be written in every scene and every line of director Raj Shandilya who has also written it

 paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki rashtriya rajdhani main yamuna nadi ke kinare bane akshardham mandir ko na to paryaavaran manjuuri mili thi or na hi mandir nirmaan karne waalon ne iske liye kabhi aavedan kiya tha

 ’ kya paryaavaran mantralay mandir ke khilaaf koi karrwai ke bare main vichaar kar rahaa he, mantri ne kaha, ‘ham akshardham mandir parisar ko nahin gira sakate
 We have to save the rest of the coastal area of yamuna River
 ’ramesh ne kaha, ‘isi tarah yah bhi ek sawaal he ki kya rashtramandal khel gaanv kaa nirmaan hona chaiye tha
 The answer is that it should not have happened at all

 In May this year, the beautiful views of the mountains of Uttarakhand from Davanal were blurred by a layer of mist
 is saal rajya main ab tak 4,200 hectare se adhik jangal aag kii bhent chadh chukaa he
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat lashed out at the forest department officials and asked what preparations did they make that the mountains were hit by such a huge fire? The Chief Minister directed to take effective steps to prevent the incidents of forest fire And said that Vanagni would be accountable to the officials concerned
 unhone sthaneey logon ko bhi is maamle main jodgaye ko kaha
 Last year, 1,244 hectares of forest area was on fire, while in 2016, about 4,500 hectares of forest was destroyed in this fire
 bhartiya aapadaa prabandhan santhaan ke daawey ke mutabik, us samay adhik garmi vanagni kaa kaaran thi
 Apart from ecology, more than Rs
 55 crores per year due to over 55 percent forest fires
 kaa aarthik nuksaan bhi hota he
 People associated with the forest department blame the locals for this fire
 hycourt ne aag se sambandhit khabaron kaa swatah sangyaan lete hue sarkaar se jawaab maanga tha
 Kapil Joshi, Chief Conservator of Forests of Kumaon Division, told the court that the fire in Kumaon region has been completely controlled
 unhone kaha ki jangalon kii aag ko niyantrit rakhane ke liye vibhaag graminon kii sahabhaagita badha rahaa he or van panchayaton ko aag bujhane ke liye dhanrashi bhi uplabdh kara rahaa he
 He told the court that in 90 percent of the cases in the state, fire was man-made
 adaalat van vibhaag ke jawaab se santusht nahin hui or sarkaar ko dobaaraa jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he
 M
, a former president of the High Court Bar Association
 si
 Pant has questioned the Forest Department's reply, "the Forest Department should enlist the help of FRI, Wadia Institute, Survey of India
 90 fisadi aag par kaabo karne kaa daawa bhi galat he
 90 percent of the fire is said to be anthropogenic, while the majority of the population has migrated from the villages
 isaki tasdik khud sarkari aankade kar rahe hai
 Local people also accuse the forest department and land mafia of setting fire
 pithauragarh ke munasyari kasbe kii paryaavaran kaaryakarta or sthaneey van panchayat adhyaksh mallika virdi kahati hai, "prakritik vajahon ke alaava darasal ghaas main se khar-patavaar or gaiyr-jaruri paundhon ko nasht karne ke liye bhi log aag lagaate hai
 They believe that grasses produced after that are good for animals
 kai baar yah aag failte hue aasapaas ke jangalon main chali jaati he or tabaahi machaati he
 "as soon as we come in contact with the lees coming out of the pine tree, this fire takes a form of a rage
" vanagni kii adhikansh ghatnaayen chid ke ghaney jangalon main darj kii gai hai
 Due to deforestation, water bodies are damaged and glaciers and rivers are also affected

 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)september 3, 2017 Introduced on the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in 2013, the option of 'none of these' (NOTA) will now have its own mark, in the form of a black 'cross' on a ballot
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main pehali baar‘nota’ke is chihn kaa iviem or mat patron par istemaal hoga
 This will be in front of the 'none of these' option
 chunaav ayog ne aaj bataaya ki is chihn kaa dizinanational institute of dizin, ahmedabad ne ayog ke liye taiyaar kiya he
 In 2013, after the Supreme Court order, the NOTA button was added as the last option on evms
 pichley saal hue aam chunaav main kareeb 60 lakh logon ne ‘nota’ kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Input: PTI sanjay dutt hameshaa se hi apane gundgardee vaale avatar se logon kaa dil jitate aa rahe hai
 Be it his serial role in 'vaastav' or the comedy character of 'munna Bhai MBBS'
 ye donon hi role sanjay dutt se behatar koi or nahin nibhaa saktaa
 Now Sanjay will once again be seen in a similar role in 'sahab Biwi Aur Gangster 3'
 film 'sahab bivi or gangster' ke nirdeshak tigmanshu dhulia ek baar phir apni film kaa sikval 'sahab bivi or gangster part 3' banane ja rahe hai, jisamen is baar gangster kaa kirdaar sanjay dutt nibhaayenge
 Let me tell you that the producer of this film is Rahul Mitra and the writer is Sanjay Chauhan
 'sahab bivi or gangster' siries kii donon filmein logon ko kaaphi pasand ai hai or ab sanjay dutt ke aane ke baad is film kaa str or bad jayega
 Apart from Sanjay, there will be more new characters in the film, Entry 'sahab Biwi and Gangster Part 3' will have many new characters this time
 haalanki pichhali filmon kii tarah is baar bhi sahab ke role main jimi shergill or bivi ke role main maahi gil hi najar aaenge
 The character of the gangster in this film has been changing every time
 pehle part main randeep hooda gangster the, duusare main irfan khan or ab sanjay dutt is kirdaar ko nibhaa rahe hai
 But this time the story will revolve around Sanjay Dutt
 kaisaa hoga sanjay dutt kaa kirdaarpart 3 kii shuruyaat main sanjay dutt khandaani andaaj main raja maharaja kii costum pahane najar aaenge
 Or rather say that in this film, Sanjay Dutt will take entry with full Rajputana airs
 sanjay kii gangster filmensanjay pehle bhi kai baar gangster ke kirdaar main tarif bator chuke hai
 Who will forget Mahesh Bhatt's film 'naam', 'possession', JP Dutta's 'weapon', Sanjay Manjrekar's 'vaastav' and so on and if the mention of gangster 'munna Bhai Series' in the style of comedy, Sanjay Dutt's career Will be considered incomplete

 is par gautam ne kaha ki abhi ve itane bade netaa bane nahin hai ki bhartiya janata party ko unke bare main sochane kii jarurat padegi
 Gautam said that during the last four and a half years BJP was accused in everything to hide its failures
 itane bade-bade sapane dikhaae gaye

 lekin shivasena bhi apane dam par sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he kyonki uske paas mahaj 56 siten hai
 Circumstances are being created that the NCP and Congress Shiv Sena should support and form a new government of Maharashtra

 After a six-wicket defeat in the second match of the three-match series against Dhoni, Bangladesh, ready to relinquish the captaincy for Indian cricket, Dhoni said in a press conference after the match that he would leave the captaincy and contribute as a player for the success of Indian cricket

 yah bhi dekho ki unhone media se jo kuch kaha vah keval niraashaa main kaha
 Bedi said, 'it happens under captaincy
 jab team jeet darj karti he to aapaki tarif hoti he or haarane par aalochana
 He has already given up Test captaincy

 But for the first time i saw her fret and it is not a good sign by any means

 lekin jin logon kii kamai is varg main he ve kehete hai ki rahan-sahan ke kharche, parivahan laagat, bacchon kii skool fees ke baad ve kuch bachaa hi nahin pate hai

 is maamle main sarkaar ne prayaas jarur kiye hai, lekin abhi bahut kuch nahin ho paaya he
 The government has to go public in the elections next year and this is its last full budget

 Apart from this, easy bank loans can be arranged for msmes on the basis of GST returns so that they do not have to go to local lenders of moneylender type
 aisa mana jaataa he ki tamaam chote kaarobaari apana dainik kaarobaar chalaane ke liye aise bhrasht netaaon, afasaron yaa bade vyapaariyon se rakam udhaar lete hai, jinke paas acha kaala dhan jamaa hota he
 For this, they also have to pay high interest
 bainkon se karj milane main mushkil kii vajah se unhen aisa karnaa padataa he
 Also, schemes like cashback of a certain portion of GST can be announced on cashless purchases
 isse jiesti or cashles lenden donon ko ek saath protsaahit kiya ja saktaa he
 This will prevent tax evasion and will also reduce the need for cash
 isse upabhoktaaon main bharosa badhegaa, vyapaar badhegaa or sarkaar ke tex khajaane main badhotaree hogi

 There was a crowd of people trying to meet the two strong leaders
 jab modi rajnath ke saamne aae to laga jaise do jigari dost lambey arase baad mil rahe hon
 In the morning, Modi wrote on Twitter that i am going to Delhi, to meet Rajnath Singh ji and congratulate him on becoming the president
 badhai unhone pehle bhi di thi, dhoorbhaash par lekin dujhi kaa abhas hua so ahmedabad se dilli aa pahunche

 agar nahin rakhni thi to jab sharif yahaan aae to unhen jhappi dekar vidaa kar dete or vahaan se jo sari ai use maa tak pahunchaakar baat khatm karte
 But canceling the conversation in this way is like a child
 sarkaar ne baatcheet se pehle pakistan ke saamne aisi koi shart nahin rakhi ki wo hurriyat se baat nahin karegaa
 Question: If an incident like 26 / 11 or an attack in Parliament happens, what will the Modi government do? Seshadri Chari: They will do what is right at that time
 hamaari respons team bahut majboot he
 Question: PM Modi did well by going to Japan
 ab china kii badhati takat ko rokane main madad milegi?manishankar ayyar:aisa bilkul nahin he kyonki shinjo abe kii sarkaar khud mushkil main he
 Although it is a prosperous country
 agar unhone hamaari baat kii to wo aaj kii nahin puraani baat he
 They have been helping us already
 agar us madad main vruddhi ho to modi ko credit jaae
 So it should not be said that a new phase is beginning with Japan
 kasee singh:ubharta china hamaare liye, japan ke liye or puure vishwa ke liye chalange he
 If China does not help Pakistan, then Pakistan cannot be a problem for India
 sheshadri chaari:ham china or japan ke saath rishton main balance karte aae hai
 We do not have to be afraid of China and there is no need to let it down in Japan

 Eid on Monday is why the Supreme Court will remain closed, so the case will be heard from August 13 to August 16
 vaise ab har hafte somvaar se shuukravaar tak cese kii sunwaayee adaalat main hogi

 Although Nitish said that there is a need for more awareness on this issue, the opposition has its own authority

 The Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal has attacked the BJP by holding a press conference on the matter of the raw colony
 kejariwal ne bhaajapa or centre sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki ramlila maidan main aane vaale dinon main keval 100 logon ko registry dekar photo khinchvaae jaaenge
 He said that through you guys, i want to tell the people of Delhi again today, do not trust anyone till the registry comes in your hands
 abhi jo maine suna he vah yah he ki keval 100 logon ko photo khinchvaane ke liye inke bade-bade netaaon kii raily hogi
 After a few days, at the Ramlila Maidan, 100 people will give the registry with their hands there
 photo khinchvaayenge
 That day will come on TV
 lekin keval 100 logon ko kyon?sari dilli ko registry kyon nahin de rahe? baaki logon ko kah rahe hai ki chunaav ke baad denge registry
 Who saw after the election? Then after the elections, the Congress would tell the same way as it used to lie? ”when asked the Chief Minister of Delhi, BJP said that once the process of giving ownership is started, people will continue to register themselves accordingly
 There is no problem in this
 is par kejariwal ne jawaab dete hue kaha, ''shila dikshit ji ne bhi teen chunaav main process chaalu kiya or jab chunaav ke baad log jate the to kaha jaataa thaki agle chunaav main aana
 Now people do not trust the process running
 ab process complit honi chahie
 Give the registry at hand
 jitne logon ke haath main registry aa jaae utane hi maananaa ki kaam ho gaya''
 Kejriwal claimed that the Delhi government is ready to give the registry to the people of the entire raw colony of Delhi within just 15 days, but the central government should first complete its process which it has not yet done
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main kachi colony bill paas ho gaya tha
 According to Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri, this will give 40 lakh people living in 1731 unauthorized colony of Delhi the right to own their house
 abhi yah bill charchaa ke baad rajyasabha main paas hona baaki he
 Describing the cbi's closure report in the Aarushi murder case as 'tragic', the National Commission for Women has written a letter to the Home Minister and the Law Minister, seeking to revisit the case
 encidblyoo kii adhyaksh girij vyas ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘bharat vigyaan or praudyogiki ke kshetra main kaaphi aage bad chukaa he or yah durbhagyapurna he ki desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai ne aarushi jaise maamle main doshiyon ko pakadaney main apni asamarthta jataai he
 He said that no one should leave no stone unturned to solve such cases so that the message goes that the conspirators of such a crime will never escape the long hands of the law
 closer report ko ‘dukhad’ bataate hue vyas ne kaha ki vah pradhanmantri se aagrah karengi ki maamle par gaur karen or is sambandh main jo bhi aavashyak kadam hon ve avashya uthaae jaaen
 He said, 'I have also written a letter to the Home and Law Minister in this regard
 ’ i did not watch the match
 mujhe yaqiin he ki match fix nahin tha
 The Indian team will never do this
 jersey par jis company kaa naam hota he, vah bhale kuch bhi kar sakati he
 Can run away with people's money
 ghatiya product bech sakati he, magar team aisa nahin karegi
 The selflessness of the team is unquestioned
 main cricket kam jaanata hum, lekin unhen jaanata hum, jo cricket dekhte hai
 After reading the comments of the people, they felt that they were doubting the team due to defeat
 jo patrkaar do-do saal se koi dhang kii khabar nahin kiye hai, ve cricket par coment kar maahaul main bane rahete hai
 Reporters like the editor's tweet
 aaj kaam na karne waalon kii duuri mit gai thi
 It worked well
 post likhakar sab bataa rahe hai ki match dekh rahe the
 Time wasted by losing the match
 varanaa match na hota, to ve hind swaraj par virendra baranwaal kii vyakhya pard rahe hote
 What happened if the Indian team played poorly? ham kai maamalon main karaab hai
 The hospital is bad
 pani kii sthiti karaab he
 The traffic condition is bad
 ek match main khel karaab ho gaya, to kya farq padataa he
 The problem is our continuity
 aaj bhartiya team ko nai jersey mili thi
 Who does not relax after wearing a new cloth
 thodaa ban-thanakar log tede ho hi jate hai
 Suddenly changing the jersey would have broken the pace
 jis khel main khilaadi baayen thukne se jeet milane par baayen hi thookte rahete hai, us khel main aapane jersey badal di
 Eliminated the inauspicious and auspicious signs earned during all previous matches
 bhartiya team ko vaastudosh lag gaya
 'new Pinch' started playing in new clothes
 viraat ko logon ne rishabh samaj liya hoga, to rahul ko rohit
 The team must relax
 fal kii chintaa na kare
