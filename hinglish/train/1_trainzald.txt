 Hrithik said these things at the launch of the title track of his film

 In the wake of the elections in Delhi, BJP is constantly besieging Arvind Kejriwal

 sitaraman ne kaha he ki ham roj arvind kejariwal se paanch sawaal puuchhenge, jab tak unhen jawaab nahin milenge, sawaal poochna jari rahegaa
 Nirmala has accused the AAP that the party's work has been outsourced

 This is an excellent story of human compassion and love
 kehete hai ki fanishwarnath renu ke 'mailaa anchal' or 'parati pariktha' jaise upanyaason par unki keval yahi ek kahani baari padati he
 The plot of this story was the craze that the famous lyricist Shailendra made a film called 'teesri Kasam'
 is film main rajkpur or wahidaa rahamaan ne mukhya bhoomika nibhaai thi
 It was directed by Basu Bhattacharya
 yah film hindi cinema main mile kaa pathar maani jaati he
 This love story of the hero 'hiraman' and the heroine Hirabai created a wonderful epic epic of love, but regrettably its grief became such a tight narrative that still captivates readers and viewers
 par kahin na kahin kachotata bhi he
 The song, music, filming and even posters of this film were unmatched
 baharhaal renu ji ne is kahani kaa dukhaant ant kyon kiya? unki punyatithi par unki is amar prem kahani 'maare gayi gulfam' ko pard faisla aap khud karen
 Story: Killed gulfam-phaniswaranath Renuhiraman looks tickling in the back of a trainman
 
 
 pichley bees saal se gaadi haankata he hiraaman
 Bullock cart
 seemaa ke us paar, morang raaj nepal se dhan or lakdi dho chukaa he
 In the era of control, the goods of burglary have been transported from this side to the other side
 lekin kabhi to aisi gudagudi nahin lagi peeth main!control kaa jamaana! hiraaman kabhi bhul saktaa he us jamaane ko! ek baar chaar khep cement or kapade kii gaanthon se bhari gaadi, zogbani main viratnagar pahunchne ke baad hiraaman kaa kalejaa pokhta ho gaya tha
 Every thief-merchant of Farbisganj would consider him a firm carman
 uske belon kii badai badi gaddi ke bade seth ji khud karte, apni bhashaa main
 The train caught for the fifth time, in the valley across this border
 mahajan kaa munim usee kii gaadi par gaanthon ke bich chukki-mukki lagaakar chipa hua tha
 Hiroman knows how fast the light of a burnt light is one and a half cubits long
 ek ghante ke liye aadmi andhaa ho jaataa he, ek chatak bhi pads jaae aankhon par! roshni ke saath kadkati hui aawaaj - “i-ya! gaadi roko! saale, goli maar denge?”bison gadiyaan ek saath kachakachaakar ruuk gai
 Hiraman had already said, "this is twenty poison!" Mr
 Daroga, putting lights on the bookkeeper lying in his car, laughed the vampire laughter - "ha-ha-ha!" Accountant G-E-E-E! Hee hee! Ai-ya, fuckin carman, what does the mouth see? Take the blanket out of the sack's mouth! " With a small stick in his hand, he stole the stomach of Munim ji and said, "this sack! s-sasala! ”there will be a very old akh-adabat in Daroga Saheb and the Bookkeeper
 nahin to utana rupaya kaboolne par bhi police-daroga kaa man na dole bhala! chaar hajaar to gaadi par baitha hi de rahaa he
 The jailor struck the second time with a stick
 “paanch hajaar!” phir khoncha - “utaro pehle
 
 
 "dropping the bookkeeper from the carriage, the inspector threw light on his eyes
 phir do sipaahiyon ke saath sadq se bees-pachchis rassi dur jhaadi ke paas le gaye
 Five gunmen on guard and vehicles guarded! Hiraman understood, not relieved this time
 jail? hiraaman ko jail kaa dar nahin
 But his bull? Do not know how many days will remain in the government gate without fodder and water - hungry and thirsty
 phir nilaam ho jaayenge
 He will never be able to show his face to brother and brother
 nilaam kii boli uske kaanon ke paas goonj gai - ek-do-teen! daaroga or munim main baat pat nahin rahi thi shaayad
 The soldier stationed near Hiraman's car asked the other soldier in his own language, in a slow voice, "how are you?" Case of a roundabout? " Then he went to the soldier on the pretext of giving him tobacco
 ek-do-teen! teen-chaar gadiyon kii aad
 Hiraman decided
 usne dhire-se apane belon ke gale kii rassiyaan khol leen
 Sitting on the car, the two were tied together
 bail samaj gaye unhen kya karnaa he
 Hiraman landed, put a bamboo ticket in the plowing car, and healed the shoulders of the bulls
 donon ke kaanon ke paas gudagudi laga di or man-hi-man bolaa,”chalo bhaiyan, jaan bachegi to aisi-aisi saggarh gadi bahut milegi
 
 
 
 ek-do-teen! nau-do-gyaarah! 
 
 gadiyon kii aad main sadq ke kinare dur tak ghani jhaadi faili hui thi
 All three beings crossed the bus with vigor - absurd, unscrupulous! Then take one, take two - trot! The two bulls stitched and then entered the thick jungles of the Terai
 raah soonghate, nadi-naala paar karte hue bhaage punch uthaakar
 Hiraman back and forth
 raat-bhar bhaagate rahe the teenon jan
 Hiraman was homeless after reaching home for two days
 hosh main aate hi usne kaan pakadqar kasam khai thi - ab kabhi aisi chizon kii ladani nahin laadenge
 Stuffed goods? Toba, Toba! Don't know what happened to the bookkeeper! God knows what happened to his saggy gadi! The real steel was an iron spindle
 donon pahie to nahin, ek pahiyaa ekadam nayaa tha
 The colorful cords in the car were kneaded with great vigor
 do kasame khai hai usne
 Will not carry the goods of a thief
 duusari - baans
 He asks each of his tenants beforehand - "stealing - is it not a shining thing?" And, bamboo? No one will give fifty rupees for loading bamboo, Hiraman's car will not be found
 duusare kii gaadi dekhe
 Bamboo cart The bamboo lead remains four hands ahead of the gadi and four hands backward! The car is always outside control so bekaabuwali ladani or kharahia
 City talk! At this point, the steward's mahabhukua servant, who was holding a bamboo lead, looked towards the girl-school
 bas, mod par ghodagadee se takkar ho gai
 By the time Hiraman pulled the rope of the oxen, the horse-drawn umbrella stuck in the vanguard of the bamboo
 ghoda-gaadeewaale ne tadatad chaabuk maarthe hue gaali di thi! baans kii ladani hi nahin, hiraaman ne kharahia shahar kii ladani bhi chod di
 And when the freight for Morang started from Farbisganj, the train crossed! For many years Hiraman plowed the bulls in half
 aadha haada gaadeewaale kaa or aadha bailawaale kaa
 Parts! Get Free! Bulls do not fill their stomachs with the income of half-masters
 pichley saal hi usne apni gaadi banavaai he
 Goddess Maia bless the tiger of that circus company
 pichley saal isi meley main baghagaadi ko dhonevaale donon ghode mar gaye
 While coming from Champanagar to the Farbisganj fair, the manager of the circus company announced in the coach-band and said - "hundred rupees will be received!" One or two trainers agreed
 lekin, unke bail baghagaadi se das haath dur hi dar se dikarne lage -baan - aan! rassi tudakar bhaage
 Hiraman rubbed the backs of his bulls and said, "look, brother, such an opportunity will not come again
" yahi he mauka apni gaadi banavaane kaa
 Otherwise, the inheritance
 are pinjade main band baagh kaa kya dar? morang kii tarai main dahaadte hui baaghon ko dekh chuke ho
 Then i am on the back
 “gadivanon ke dal main taaliyaan patapata uthin thim ek saath
 Hiraman's oxen took care of everyone
 humakkar aage batch gae or baghagaadi main jute gaye - ek-ek karke
 Only the right bull urged a lot after licking
 hiraaman ne do din tak naak se kapade kii pattee nahin kholi thi
 No one can ruin the smell of a big Gaddi without a banquet like the elder Seth ji
 baghagaadi kii gaadivaani kii he hiraaman ne
 Never had such a tickle in my back
 aaj rah-rahakar uski gaadi main champa kaa phool mahak uthta he
 He ticks the back with a fingertip when it tickles in the back
 hiraaman ko lagata he, do varsh se champanagar meley kii bhagwati maiyaa us par prasann he
 Last year the tiger cart collapsed
 nakad ek sau rupe bhade ke alaava butaad, chaah-biscuit or raste-bhar bandar-bhaaluu or joker kaa tamaasha dekha so fokat main!or, is baar yah janaani sawari
 Is it a woman or a Champa flower! The vehicle has been smelling ever since
 kachi sadq ke ek chote-se khadd main gaadi ka dahinaa pahiyaa bemauke hichkola kha gaya
 a light sigh sounded from Hiraman's car
 hiraaman ne daahine bail ko duaali se peetate hue kaha,”saalaa! kya samajhataa he, bore kii ladani he kya?”“ahaa! maaro mat!”andekhi aurat kii aawaaj ne hiraaman ko achraj main daal diya
 Like the children's dialect as fine, the frugal language! Who would not have heard the name of Hirabai, who became Laila in the Mathuramohan gimmick company! But Hiraman is unique! He has fought fairs continuously for seven years, never seen a gimmick-theater or byscope cinema
 laila yaa hirabai kaa naam bhi usne nahin suna kabhi
 What to see! So fifteen days before the fair broke, at midnight Bella, i was struck by a woman in a black trouser
 baksaa dhonevaale naukar se gaadi-haada main mol-molai karne kii koshish kii to odhanivali ne sir hilaakar manaa kar diya
 Hiraman asked the servant while sowing the car, "brother, why is there no stolen stolen goods?" Hiraman was again surprised
 baksaa dhonevaale aadmi ne haath ke ishaare se gaadi haankane ko kaha or andhere main gaayab ho gaya
 Hiraman remembered the black sari of the old lady selling tobacco at the fair
 aise main koi kya gaadi haanke!ek to peeth main gudagudi lag rahi he
 Secondly, Champa's flower blossoms in his car
 belon ko daanto to is-bis karne lagati he uski sawari
 Ride her! Woman alone, not an old tobacco seller! After hearing the sound he repeatedly casts a glance at the mud-tapper; He scrubs his back with a towel
 
 
 bhagwaan jane kya likhaa he is baar uski kismat main! gaadi zab purab kii ore mudi, ek tukda chandani uski gaadi main samaa gai
 a firefly flashed on the ride's nose
 hiraaman ko sabakuch rahasyamay - ajagut-ajagut- lag rahaa he
 The ground stretches from Champanagar to Scindia village
 
 Is there a Dakin-vampirein? Hiraman's ride turned
 chandani puure mukhade par paddy to hiraaman cheekhte-cheekhte ruuk gaya - are baap! i to pari he!pari kii ankhen khul gayi
 Hiraman turned to face the road in front and gave bullocks to bullocks
 vah jeebh ko taalu se sataakar ti-ti-ti-ti aawaaj nikaalata he
 Since Hiraman's tongue was not known, he had become dry like wood! "brother, what is your name?" 
 
 Hiraman's thumbs up
 munh se boli nahin nikali
 Both his bulls also test this ear by standing up
 “meraa naam! 
 
 
 Naam mein hairaman! ”his ride smiles
 
 
 
 There is a scent in the smile
 “tab to mita kahoongi, bhaiya nahin
 - My name is also Heera
 ”“iss!” hiraaman ko paratit nahin, “mard or aurat ke naam main fark hota he
 "yes, my name is Hirabai too
" ”kahan hiraaman or kahan hirabai, bahut fark he!hiraaman ne apane belon ko jhidki di - “kaan chuniyaakar gap sunne se hi tees kos manzil kategi kya? is baayein nate ke pet main shaitani bhari he
 Hiraman gave the left bull a light clap of dualism
 “maaro mat; dhire dhire chalane do
 What is the hurry! ”the question appeared in front of Hiraman, what should he say with gossip? So say it or here? In his language, elders are addressed here, that is to say, two or four questions can be answered in the garbage dialect, heart-opening gossip can be done in the village dialect itself
 asin-kartik ke bhor main chaa janevaale kuhase se hiraaman ko puraani chidh he
 Many times he has wandered forgetting the road
 kintu aaj ke bhor ke is ghaney kuhase main bhi vah magan he
 Winds of paddy plants bloomed from the wealth-fields along the river
 parv-paavan ke din gaanv main aisi hi sugandh faili rahati he
 Then Champa's flower blossomed in his car
 us phool main ek pari baithi he
 
 
 Zai Bhagwati hiraaman ne aankh kii kanakhiyon se dekha, uski sawari 
 
 
 Mita
 
 
 hirabai kii ankhen gujur-gujur usko her rahi hai
 An Ajani Ragini rang in Hiraman's mind
 sari deh sirsira rahi he
 Said, "do you mind if you kill the bull?" Heerabai tested, Hiraman is really a diamond
 chalis saal kaa hatta-katta, kaala-kaluta, dehati noujvaan apni gaadi or apane belon ke sivaay duniya kii kisi or baat main vishesh dilchaspee nahin letaa
 There is a big brother at home, he does farming
 bal-bachevaala aadmi he
 Hiraman respects his sister-in-law over his brother
 bhabhi se darataa bhi he
 Hiraman was also married, Dulahin died before he was even a child
 hiraaman ko apni dulhin kaa cheharaa yaad nahin
 
 
 Second marriage? There are many reasons for not getting a second marriage
 bhabhi kii jid, kumari ladkee se hi hiraaman kii shaadi karavaaegi
 Kumari means girl of five-seven years
 koun maanata he sardha-kanoon? koi ladkeewala dobyahoo ko apni ladkee garaj main padane par hi de saktaa he
 Sister-in-law is sitting on her three legs, she is sitting
 bhabhi ke aage bhaiya kii bhi nahin chalati! 
 
 
 Now Hiraman has decided not to marry
 koun balaay mol lene jaae! 
 
 
 What will someone do to the carriage after getting married! And everything is left out, Hiraman cannot leave the vehicle
 hirabai ne hiraaman ke jaisaa nishchal aadmi bahut kam dekha he
 Asked, "who lives in your district?" As soon as he heard the name of Kanpur, which laughed his laughter, then the bull broke out
 hiraaman hanste samay sir nicha kar letaa he
 When the laughter stopped, he said, "wow, Kanpur! Then will Nakpur also? " And when Hirabai said that there is also Nakpur, he started laughing and laughing
 “vaah re duniya! kya-kya naam hota he! kanpur, nakpur!” hiraaman ne hirabai ke kaan ke phool ko gaur se dekho
 Seeing the image of Naq's image, the word got up - the drop of blood! Hiraman never heard the name of Hirabai
 nautanki company kii aurat ko vah baiji nahin samajhataa he
 
 
 
 company main kaam karanevaali auraton ko vah dekh chukaa he
 The mistress of the circus company used to come to the tiger cart along with his two young daughters, feed and feed the tiger, and loved it a lot
 hiraaman ke belon ko bhi dableroti-biscuit khilaayaa tha bady beti ne
 Hiraman is smart
 kuhasaa chhantate hi apni chadar se tappar main paradaa kar diya - “bas do ghanta! uske baad rasta chalanaa mushkil he
 You will not be able to waste the dust of Katik's morning
 kajri nadi ke kinare tegchhiya ke paas gaadi laga denge
 Cut out the two wheels
 
 
 
 "he became alert after seeing the car coming from the front from far away
 li or belon par dhyaan lagaakar baith gaya
 Crossing the path, the trainman asked, "is the fair going to break, brother?" Hiraman replied, he does not know about the fair
 uski gaadi par bidaagi (naihar yaa sasuraal jaati hui ladkee) he
 Do not know which village Hiraman told the name of
 “chhatapur-pachira kahan he?”“kahin ho, yah lekar aap kya kariega?” hiraaman apni chaturaai par hansaa
 Even after putting the curtain, it feels tickling in the back
 hiraaman parade ke chhed se dekhtaa he
 Hirabai is watching his teeth in the mirror, equal to a match box
 
 
 madanpur meley main ek baar belon ko nanheen-chitti kaudiyon kii maala kharid di thi
 Hiraman, the small, little cauldron
 tegchhiya ke teenon ped dur se hi dikhalaai passage hai
 Hiraman shrugged the curtain and said, "look, this is Teghchia
 do ped zatamasi bed he or ek us phool kaa kya naam he, aapke kurte par jaisaa phool chapa hua he, vaisaa hi; khub mahaktaa he; do kos dur tak gandh jaati he; us phool ko khamira tambaakoo main daalkar pite bhi hai log
 "and with that Amrai's eye many houses are visible, is there any village or temple?" Asked Hiraman, before drinking the beedi, "drink beedi?" Do not you like the smell? 
 
 That is Namalagar Deodhi
 zis raja ke meley se ham log aa rahe hai, usee kaa diyaad-gotiyaa he
 
 
 
 ja re jamaana!”hiraaman ne ja re jamaana kahkar baat ko chaashni main daal diya
 Tilted the screen of Hirabai Tupper diagonally
 hirabai kii dantapankti
 "who is the time?" Sahagra said with a hand on the chin
 “namalgar dayodhi ka jamaana! kya tha or kya-se-kya ho gaya!”hiraaman gap rasaane kaa bhed jaanata he
 Hirabai said, "did you see that era?" "haven't seen, heard
 raaj kaise gaya, bady hafvaali kahani he
 It is heard that the deity took birth in the house
 kahie bhala, devtaa aakhir devtaa he
 Yes or No? If Indrasan is born in Miratubhuvan, how can anyone handle his glory! Like a sunflower flower, there would be sharp feeding near the forehead
 lekin najar kaa pher kisi ne nahin pahachaanaa
 Once in Uplaine, Mr
 Saat came from Maya Latni, by air
 laat ne bhi nahin, pahachaanaa aakhir latni ne
 Surjamukhi shouted at the sight - a man Raja sir, listen, this is not a man's child, he is a god
 ”hiraaman ne laatni kii boli kii nakal utaarte samay khub dam-fat-lat kiya
 Hirabai laughed openly
 hanste samay uski sari deh dulkati he
 Heerabai corrected her veil
 tab hiraaman ko laga ki 
 
 
 Felt that
 
 "then? What happened after that? "" Iss! Do you have a big listen to the story? 
 
 
 lekin, kaala aadmi, raja kya maharaja bhi ho jaae, rahegaa kaala aadmi hi
 From where will you get a fortune like Saheb! Everyone laughed and talked
 tab rani ko baar-baar sapana dene laga devtaa! seva nahin kar sakate to jane do, nahin, rahenge tumhaare yahan
 After this the game of deity started
 sabase pehle donon dantar hathi mare, phir ghoda, phir patapataang 
 
 
 "what is Patpatang?" Hiraman's mind is changing moment by moment
 man main sataranga chaataa dhire-dhire khil rahaa he, usko lagata he
 
 
 
 uski gaadi par devkul kii aurat savaar he
 God is god! ”patpatang! Money, wealth and goods are all clean! The deity went to Indrasana
 ”hirabai ne ojhal hote hue mandir ke kangure kii ore dekhakar lambii saans lee
 "but the deity said while going, there will never be two sons in this kingdom except one
 dhan ham apane saath le ja rahe hai, gun chod zaate hai
 All the gods and goddesses went away with the deity, only Sarosati Maia remained
 usee kaa mandir he
 "seeing the bunny-laden bunnies coming on the home horse, Hiraman dropped the screen of the tapper
 belon ko lalkaar kar bidesiya naach kaa bandanagith gane laga-“ji maiyaa sarosati, araji karat bani;hamaraa par hokhu sahai he maiyaa, hamaraa par hokhu sahai!”ghodldde baniyon se hiraaman ne hulsakar poocha, “kya bhav patua kharidte he mahajan?”langade ghodevale baniye ne batagmani jawaab diya - “neeche sataais-athis, upar tees
 Like goods, same sentiment
 ”jawan baniye ne poocha, “meley kaa kya haalchaal he, bhai? koun nautanki company kaa khel ho rahaa he, rauta company yaa mathuramohan?”“meley kaa haal melawala jane?” hiraaman ne phir chhatapur-pachira kaa naam liya
 The sun had come up two bamboo
 hiraaman apane belon se baat karne laga - “ek kos jameen! jaraa dam baandhakar chalo
 There is no need to thirst! Remember, that time Teghchia got into a fight with the joker and monkey siren of the circus company
 jokarva thik bandar kii tarah daant kitkitaakar kikriyaane laga tha, na jane kis-kis des-muluk ke aadmi aate hai!”hiraaman ne phir parade ke chhed se dekha, hirabai ek kaagaj ke tukde par aankh gadaakar baithi he
 Hiraman's mind is now bound in mild tone
 usko tarah-tarah ke geeton kii yaad aati he
 Twenty-twenty-five years ago, Bidesia, Balwahi, Chhokra-dances used to sing one-to-one ghazal khemta
 ab to, bhompa main bhompu-bhompu karke koun geet gaate hai log! ja re jamaana! chhokara-naach ke geet kii yaad ai hiraaman ko--“sajanavaa bairi ho gay hamaaro! sajanavaa!are, chithiya ho te sab koi baanche; chithiya ho tohai! karamwa, hoy karamwagadee kii balli par oongliyon se taal dekar geet ko kaat diya hiraaman ne
 Manuva Natuva of chokra-nach had a face like Hirabai
 
 
 
 Where has that era gone? Every month there were dancing people in the village
 hiraaman ne chhokara-naach ke chalate apni bhabhi kii na jane kitni boli-tholi suni thi
 Brother asked to leave the house
 aaj hiraaman par maan sarosati sahay hai, lagata he
 Hirabai said, "wow, you sing so well!" Hiraman's face turned red
 vah sir nicha karke hansane laga
 Today Mahavir Swami, who lives on Teghchia, is also helpless on Hiraman
 tegchhiya ke neeche ek bhi gaadi nahin
 There are always vehicles and crowds of carriages here
 sirf ek cyclawala baithkar susta rahaa he
 Hiraman stopped the vehicle after hearing Mahavir Swami
 hirabai paradaa hataane lagi
 Hiraman spoke with eyes for the first time in Hirabai - the cyclist is staring here
 belon ko kholane ke pehle baans kii tikt lagaakar gaadi ko tikaa diya
 Then staring repeatedly at the cyclist, he asked, "where to go?" fair? Where are you coming from? From Bissanpur? Tired of being so far away? - Ja re jawani! ”the lean-to-young young man, a cyclist, said something and Beidi smiled and stood up
 hiraaman duniya-bhar kii nigaah se bachaakar rakhana chahta he hirabai ko
 He looked around and saw - there was no car or horse
 kajri nadi kii dubli-patali dhara tegchhiya ke paas aakar purab kii ore mud gai he
 Hirabai kept watching buffaloes sitting in water and herons sitting on their backs
 hiraaman bolaa, “jaaie, ghat par munh-haath dho aaie!”hirabai gaadi se neeche utari
 Hiraman's heart broke
 
 
 
 No no! The legs are straight, not curved
 lekin, taluva itnaa laal kyon hai? hirabai ghat kii ore chali gai, gaanv kii bahu-beti kii tarah sir nicha karke dhire-dhire
 Who would say that she is a woman of the company! 
 
 
 aurat nahin, ladkee
 Perhaps she is a virgin
 hiraaman tikt par tiki gaadi par baith gaya
 He looked into Tupper
 ek baar idhar-udhar dekhakar hirabai ke takiye par haath rakh diya
 Then put the elbow on the pillow, bent down
 khushboo uski deh main samaa gai
 On touching the pillow cover, he sniffed the toured flowers with fingers, hey! Such an aroma! Hiraman thought, he got up by blowing five chilli ganja together
 hirabai ke chote aaine main usne apana munh dekha
 Why are his eyes so red? Hirabai came back and he laughed and said, "now guard the car, i come quickly
" ”hiraaman ne apana safari jholii se saheji hui ganji nikaali
 Took the pot on the shoulder and walked away with a bucket in his hand
 uske belon ne baari-baari se hunk-hunk karke kuch kaha
 Hiraman, on the contrary, said, "yes, everyone is thirsty
" lautakar aata hoon to ghaas doongaa, badmaasi mat karo!”belon ne kaan hilaae
 When Hiraman returned after taking a bath, Heerabai does not know
 kajri kii dhara ko dekhte-dekhte uski aankhon main raat kii uchati hui neend laut ai thi
 Hiraman has brought curd-chuda-sugar from the nearby village for refreshments
 “uthie, neend todie! do mutthi jalpan kar lijie!”hirabai aankh kholkar achraj main pads gai
 Curd, banana leaves in a new earthen pot in one hand
 duusare haath main balti-bhar pani
 An affectionate request in the eyes! "where did i get so many things from!" 
 
 
 If you want, you will get it by going to Farbisganj
 ”hiraaman ne kaha, “tum bhi pattal bichhaao
 
 
 Why? If you do not eat, then keep it in your bag
 main bhi nahin khaauungi
 "iss!" Hiraman blushed and said, "good thing! You eat first! "" What's behind? You also sit
 ”hiraaman kaa ji juda gaya
 Heerabai spread his plate with his hand, splashed water, removed the bangles
 iss! dhann he, dhann he! hiraaman ne dekha, bhagwati maiyaa bhoga laga rahi he
 Gorse on red lips! 
 
 
 pahari tote ko doodh-bhaat khate dekha he?din dhal gaya
 Hirabai slept in the tapper and laying on the ground, Hiraman slept simultaneously
 
 
 meley kii ore janevaali gadiyaan tegchhiya ke paas ruki hai
 The children are dancing
 hiraaman hadbadakar uthaa
 Peeping inside the Tupper said with a hint - the day is over! While plowing the oxen in the car, he did not answer any questions from the cartmen
 gaadi haankate hue bolaa, “sirpur bazaar ke ispetal kii dogkerani hai
 The patient is going to see
 paas hi kurmagam
 "hirabai forgot the name of chhattapur-pachira
 gaadi zab kuch dur aage batch ai to usne hanskar poocha, “pattapur-chhapira?”hanste-hanste pet main bal pads gae hiraaman ke -- “pattapur-chhapira! ha-ha ve log chhattapur-pachira ke hi gaadiwan the, unase kaise kahata! hi-hi-hi!”hirabai muskaraati hui gaanv kii ore dekhne lagi
 The road originates from the village of Tegchia
 gaanv ke bacchon ne paradevaali gaadi dekhi or taaliyaan baja-bajaakar rati hui panktiyaan duhraane lage -“laali-laali doliya menlali re dulahaniyapan khaae 
 
 
 ! "hiraman laughed
 
 
 
 Dulhania
 
 Rouge dolly Dulhinia eats pan, wipes her face in Dulha's turban
 o dulhinia, tegchhiya gaanv ke bacchon ko yaad rakhana
 Returning plum, good-hearted ladoo lakh varis tera hulha jie! 
 
 qitne dinon kaa hausala puraa hua he hiraaman kaa! aise kitne sapane dekhe hai usne! vah apni dulhin ko lekar laut rahaa he
 Children from every village are singing with applause
 har aangan se jhaankakar dekh rahi hai auraten
 Men ask, "where is the car, where will it go?" Her bride-to-be looks at the doli slightly
 or bhi kitne sapane 
 
 gaanv se baahar nikalakar usne kanakhiyon se tappar ke andar dekha, hirabai kuch soch rahi he
 Hiraman also started thinking
 thodi der ke baad vah gunagunaane laga-“sajan re jhooth mati bolo, khuda ke paas janaa he
 No elephant, no horse, no cart - go there on foot
 sajan re 
 
 
 
 ”hirabai ne poocha, “kyon mita? tumhaari apni boli main koi geet nahin kya?”hiraaman ab bekhatak hirabai kii aankhon main ankhen daalkar baat karata he
 Is the woman of the company also like this? Mistress of the circus company was Mem
 lekin hirabai! gaanv kii boli main geet sunanaa chaahati he
 He smiled openly - "do you understand the dialect of the village?" "I am, i am!" Hirabai shook his neck
 kaan ke jhumake hill gaye
 Hiraman kept silent bulls silently for a while
 phir bolaa, “geet jarur hi suniega? nahin maniega? iss! itnaa sock gaanv kaa geet sunne kaa he aapako! tab li chhodni hogi
 How can someone sing the song on the way! "hiraman pulled the left bull's rope out of the right and leaked," Then you will not go through Haripur
 ”chaalu li ko katate dekhakar hiraaman kii gaadi ke pechhevaale gaadiwan ne chillaakar poocha, “kaahe ho gaadiwan, li chhodir beli kahan udhar?”hiraaman ne hawa main duaali ghumaate hue jawaab diya - “kahan he beliki? vah sadq nananpur to nahin jaaegi
 "then babbled myself," This habit of the people of this country is bad
 raah chalate ek sau jirah karenge
 Hey brother, you have to go, go
 
 
 dehati bhucch sab!”nananpur kii sadq par gaadi laakar hiraaman ne belon kii rassi dhili kar di
 The bulls caught step by step
 hirabai ne dekha, sachmuch nananpur kii sadq bady suuni he
 Hiraman understands her eyes - "nothing to panic
 yah sadq bhi farbishganj jaaegi, raah-ghat ke log bahut achche hai
 
 
 We will reach by a clock night
 ”heerabai was in no hurry to reach Farbisganj
 hiraaman par usko itnaa bharosa ho gaya ki dar-bhay kii koi baat nahin uthati he man main
 Hiraman smiled at first
 koun geet gaae vah! hirabai ko geet or katha donon kaa shauk he 
 
 
 This Mahua Ghatwarin? He said, "well, when you have so much listen, listen to the song of Mahua Ghatwarin
 isamen geet bhi he, kattha bhi he
 After how many days Bhagwati also fulfilled this encouragement
 jai bhagwati! aaj hiraaman apane man ko khalas kar legaa
 He kept looking at Heerabai's stoic smile
 “suniye! aaj bhi parmaar nadi main mahua ghatwarin ke kai puraane ghat hai
 Mahua belonged to this Muluk! It was Ghatwarin, but there was one in a hundred Satvantis uskaa baap daaru-tadi pikar din-raat behosh pada rahata
 His stepmother Sakhat Rakasani! Very big eye-driver
 raat main ganja-daaru-opium churaakar bechnewale se lekar tarah-tarah ke logon se uski jaan-pahchaan thi
 The most hilarious
 mahua kumari thi
 But Rakasani had removed her bone while doing work
 jawan ho gai, kahin shaadi-byaah kii baat bhi nahin chalaai
 Listen for one night! ”hiraman softly clears his throat - o a-a-a-savanna-bhadwa ke - ra-umdal nadiya - I-yo-o-o, mayo gay rani bhayavani-ho -a-e-a; tadka-tadde dhadke karej-a-aa moraki hamhu j bar-nanhi re-a-a
 
 
 
 "oh mother! The river swelled by the rainy nights, the night of lightning, the lightning strikes, i am a small child, my heart hurts
 akeli kaise jaaon ghat par? so bhi paradeshi raahi-batohi ke pair main tel lagane ke liye! sat-maan ne apni bajjar-kibadi band kar lee
 The cloud rose in the sky and started raining
 mahua rone lagi, apni maan ko yaad karke
 If his mother had lived today, then in such a day, he kept his Mahua daughter in awe, for the same day, he kept you in the womb for this day? Mahua resented her mother - why did she die alone? hiraaman ne lakshya kiya, hirabai takiye par kehuni gadaakar, geet main magan ekatak uski ore dekh rahi he
 
 
 
 khoi hui surat kisi bholi lagati he!hiraaman ne gale main canpakanpi paidaa kii -“hoon-uun-uun-re dianiyaan maiyo mori-i-i,nonwa chataayee kaahe naahi marali souri-ghar-a-a
 For the sake of this day, Chhenro dhiyathenhu posli's milk and milk is grown
 
 
 hiraaman ne dam lete hue poocha, “bhakha bhi samajhati hai kuch yaa khaali geet hi sunati hai?”hira boli, “samajhati hoon
 Ugatan mane ubtan - which is applied in the body
 ”hiraaman ne vismit hokar kaha, “iss!” 
 
 so rone-dhone se kya hoe! saudagar ne puraa daam chukaa diya tha mahua kaa
 Clutching the hair, climbed on the boat and ordered Majhi, open the boat, sail! The Palwali boat went flying like a bird
 raat-bhar mahua roti-chatpataati rahi
 The merchant's servants were very frightened and threatened - Shut up, you will not pick up and throw them in the water
 bas, mahua ko baat sujh gai
 The peacock's star came out of the cloud's cloud, then hid
 idhar mahua bhi chhapaak se kud paddy pani main
 
 
 
 saudagar kaa ek naukar mahua ko dekhte hi mohit ho gaya tha
 He also jumped on Mahua's back
 ulti dhara main tairnaa khel nahin, so bhi bhari bhadon kii nadi main
 Mahua was the daughter of Asal Ghatwarin
 machhlee bhi bhala thakti he pani main! safari machhlee-jaisi farfarati, pani chirati bhaagi chali ja rahi he
 And after that the merchant's servant cried out and says - "mahua, please hold me, i am not coming to catch you, i am your companion
 jindagi-bhar saath rahenge ham log
 " but 
 
 
 
 This is Hiraman's favorite song
 mahua ghatwarin gaate samay uske saamne sawan-bhadon kii nadi umadne lagati he; amavasya kii raat or ghaney badalon main rah-rahakar bijli chamak uthati he
 In the same glow, he gets a glimpse of bari-kumari Mahua, fighting with the waves
 safari machhlee kii chaal or tej ho jaati he
 He feels that he himself is the servant of the merchant
 mahua koi baat nahin sunati
 Does not pass
 ulatakar dekhati bhi nahin
 And he is tired, floating
 is baar lagata he mahua ne apane ko pakad diya
 It has caught itself
 usne mahua ko chhu liya he, paa liya he, uski thakn dur ho gai he
 For fifteen-twenty years, his mind has got an edge while swimming in the reverse stream of the overflowing river
 anand ke ansu koi bhi roak nahin maanate
 He tried to steal his wet eyes from Hirabai
 kintu hira to uske man main baithi na jane kab se sabakuch dekh rahi thi
 Hiraman, overcoming his trembling dialect, gave the bulls a shrug - "what is not known in this song that both of them get shocked on hearing this
 lagata he, sau man boj lad diya kisi ne
 "hirabai takes long breaths
" hiraaman ke ang-ang main umang samaa jaati he
 "you are a master, Mita!" "iss!" Asin-katik's sun is withering as soon as it remains two days
 suraj doobane se pehle hi nananpur pahunchnaa he, hiraaman apane belon ko samajha rahaa he - “kadam kholkar or kalejaa baandhakar chalo 
 
 e 
 
 
 Chh 
 Chh! Good Brother! Lay-le-e-hey! har lalkaar ke pehle vah apane belon ko beeti hui baton kii yaad dilaataa - yaad nahin, choudhary kii beti kii baraat main kitni gadiyaan thim; sabko kaise maat kiya tha! haan, vah kadam nikaalo
 Take! Nannanpur to Farbisganj 3 Kos! Two hours more! Tea is also being sold at the Hat of Nananpur
 hiraaman apane lote main chaay bharkar le aayaa
 
 
 
 company kii aurat jaanata he vah, sara din, ghadi ghadi bhar main chaay piti rahati he
 Have tea or darling Heera is laughing and laughing - "hey, who told you that queer man shouldn't drink tea?" Hiraman was ashamed
 kya bole vah? 
 
 
 a matter of shame lekin vah bhoga chukaa he ek baar
 He has watched by drinking tea in the hand of the memes of the circus company
 bady garm taasir!“pijie guru ji!” hira hansee!“iss!”nananpur haat par hi diya-baati jal chuki thi
 Hiraman lit his traveling lantern and hung it in the backyard
 aajkal shahar se paanch kos dur ke gaanwvaale bhi apane ko shahru samajhane lage hai
 They challan the car without light
 baarah bakheda!“aap mujhe guru ji mat kahie
 "" You are my master
 hamaare shaster main likhaa hua he, ek achhar sikhaanevaala bhi guru or ek raag sikhaanevaala bhi ustad!”“iss! saster-puraan bhi jaanati hai! 
 
 
 What did i teach i what 
 ? "heera started laughing and muttering -" Hey-a-a-sa-savanna-bhadwa ke-su
 
 ! ”hiraman was dumbfounded by surprise
 
 
 
 This So fast mind! Hoo-hoo mahua ghatwarin! The car decelerated at the descent of a dry stream of Sitadhar
 hirabai ne hiraaman kaa kandhaa dhar liya ek haath se
 Hiraman's fingers remained on his shoulder for a long time
 hiraaman ne najar firaakar kandhe par kendrit karne kii koshish kii, kai baar
 When the car reached the climb, the diamond's loose fingers were stretched again
 saamne farbishganj shahar kii roshni jhilamila rahi he
 The lights of the fair are some distance away from the city
 
 
 tappar main latake laalaten kii roshni main chaaya naachati he aasapaas
 With lighted eyes, every light appears like a sunflower flower
 farbishganj to hiraaman kaa ghar-duaar he!na jane kitni baar vah farbishganj aayaa he
 The fair is laden
 kisi aurat ke saath? haan, ek baar
 The year her sister came in the cow
 isi tarah tirpal se gaadi ko chaaron ore se gherkar basa banaaya gaya tha
 Hiraman is surrounding his car with a tarpaulin, in the coach-belt
 subah hote hi reeta nautanki company ke manager se baat karke bharti ho jaaegi hirabai
 The fair is opening the day after tomorrow
 is baar meley main palchatti khub jami he
 
 
 
 bas, ek raat
 She will be in Hiraman's car tonight
 
 
 
 Not in Hiraman's car, but in the house! "where is the car?" 
 
 
 qun, hiraaman! kis meley se? kis cheez kii ladani he?”gaanv-samaaj ke gaadiwan, ek-duusare ko khojkar, aasapaas gaadi lagaakar basa daalate hai
 Hiraman was stunned by seeing a team of cartmen from his village Lalmohar, Dhunniram and Palatdas, etc
 udhar palatdaas tappar main jhaankakar bhadqa
 It was as if the tiger was seen
 hiraaman ne ishaare se sabhi ko chup kiya
 Then he whispered towards the car and whispered - "shut up!" The woman of the company is the gimmick of the company
 ” “company kii -i-i-i!”“ ? ? 
 
 
 The The 
 
 
 !”ek nahin, ab chaar hiraaman! chaaron ne achraj se ek-duusare ko dekha
 How effective is the company name! Hiraman aimed, the trio collapsed together
 lalamohar ne jaraa dur hatakar batiyaane kii ichha prakat kii, ishaare se hi
 Hiraman turned to the tapper and said, "no one will be open, but take some confection from here!" "hiraman, listen here
 
 
 
 i will not eat anything right now
 lo, tum kha aao
 "what is money?" This! " 
 
 
 paisa dekar hiraaman ne kabhi farbishganj main kachi-pakki nahin khai
 There are so many carriers in his village, for what day? He cannot touch money
 usne hirabai se kaha, “bekaar, mela-bazaar main huzzat mat kiijie
 Keep money ” mauka paakar lalamohar bhi tappar ke kareeb aa gaya
 He saluted, saying, "two men can eat with Khusi in the form of four men
" basa par bhaat chadhaa hua he
 h xxrep 6 h We belong to the same village
 gaanvo-giramin ke rahete hotil or halwai ke yahan khayega hiraaman?” hiraaman ne lalamohar kaa haath tip diya - “basi bhachar-bhachar mat bako
 As the four ropes of the car went away, Dhuniram opened his murmuring heart - "iss! You too are Hiraman! That year the tiger of the company, the mother of the company this time! ek to pachhim kii aurat, tis par company kii!”dhunniram ne apni shankaa prakat kii - “lekin company main to sunate hai paturia rahati he
 "shit!" All of them together gave him a tear, "what a man! Paturia will be good in the company! Look at its wisdom
 suna he, dekha to nahin he kabhi!”dhunniram ne apni galati maan lee
 Palatadas got the idea - "hiraman bhai, Janaana Jat will be alone on the car?" Whatever it is, zannaana is after all
 koi jarurat hi pads jaae!”yah baat sabhi ko acchhee lagi
 Hiraman said, "it's okay
" palat, tum laut jaao, gaadi ke paas hi rahanaa
 And look, gossip a little
 haan!”hiraaman kii deh se atar-gulab kii khushboo nikalati he
 Hiraman is Karamsaud
 us baar maheenon tak uski deh se baghin gandh nahin gai
 Lalmohar sniffed Hiraman's grin - "a-ha!" Hiraman stopped walking - "what to do, Lalmohar brother, just say it! Buddy insists, says, gotta watch the gimmick
 ”“fokat main hi?”“or gaanv nahin pahunchegi yah baat?”hiraaman bolaa, “nahin ji! ek raat nautanki dekhakar jindagi-bhar boli-tholi koun sune? 
 
 
 Desi hen willy-nilly! ”dhunniram asked,“ Will you be able to hear me even if i look at the focus? ”next to Lalmohar's bass, a wooden shop is packed with carriers
 basa ke mir-gaadiwan mianjaan boode ne safari gudbudi pite hue poocha, “kyon bhai, minaabazar kii ladani ladakar koun aayaa he?”minaabazar! minaabazar to paturia-pattee ko kehete hai
 
 
 What does this old lady say? Lalmohar whispered into Hiraman's ear and said, "your body smells great
" sach!”lahasanawaan lalamohar kaa naukar-gaadiwan he
 Is the youngest in age
 pehali baar aayaa he to kya? babu-babuinon ke yahan bachapan se naukari kar chukaa he
 He smells something in the atmosphere, nose-to-nose
 hiraaman ne dekha, lahasanawaan kaa cheharaa tamatam gaya he
 Who is coming, banging? - "who, Palatdas?" What is that? ”palatadas came and stood silently
 uskaa munh bhi tamtamaaya hua tha
 Hiraman asked, "what happened? Why don't you speak? " Hiraman warned him to gossip smartly
 vah chupchaap gaadi kii asani par jaakar baith gaya, hiraaman kii jagah par
 Hirabai asked, "you are with Hiraman too?" Palatadas nodded and nodded
 hirabai phir let gai
 
 
 
 cheharaa-mohara or boli-bani dekh-sunakar, palatdaas kaa kalejaa kaanpane laga; na jane kyon
 Yes! Siya Sukumari was tired in Ramlila like this
 jai! siyavar ramchandra kii jai! 
 
 palatdaas ke man main jai-jaikaar hone laga
 He is slave-vaisnava, Kirtania
 thakee hui sita maharani ke charan tipane kii ichha prakat kii usne, haath kii ungliyon ke ishaare se; maano hormonium kii patariyon par nachaa rahaa ho
 Hirabai sat down sobbing - "hey, what is crazy?" Go, run! 
 
 
 ”palatdaas ko laga, gussai hui company kii aurat kii aankhon se chinagaari nikal rahi he-chhatak - chhatak! vah bhaaga
 What answer should you give, palatdas? He is also thinking of a way to escape from the fair
 bolaa, “kuch nahin
 We found the merchant
 abhi hi tisan jaakar maal ladanaa he
 It is still late in the evening
 main laut aata hoon tab tak
 While eating, Dhunniram and Lahswan blamed a basket of palatdas
 chota aadmi he
 Is a bastard
 paise-paise kaa hisaab jodta he
 After eating and drinking, Lalmohar's team broke his bass
 dhunni or lahasanawaan gaadi zotkar hiraaman ke basa par chale, gaadi kii li dharkar
 Hiraman stopped walking and said to Lalmohar, "just smell my shoulder
" soonghakar dekho na?”lalamohar ne kandhaa soonghakar aankhe mand leen
 The word came out of the mouth - "A - ha!" Hiraman said, "such a fragrance when you put a little hand! 
 
 Understand! " Lalmohar held Hiraman's hand - "had a hand on the shoulder, really?" 
 
 Listen Hiraman, such a chance to see the gimmick will never be seen again
 haan!”“tum bhi dekhoge?” lalamohar kii battisi chauraahey kii roshni main jhilamila uthi
 Arriving at Basa, Hiraman saw that someone was standing near the tapper from Hirabai
 dhunni or lahasanawaan ne ek hi saath kaha, “ kahan rah gaye peeche? bahut der se khoj rahi he company 
 
 
 ! ”hiraman went to Tupper and saw - Hey, this same box-carrying servant who had hijacked Hirabai on a car in the Champanagar fair and disappeared in the dark
 “aa gaye hiraaman! acchhee baat, idhar aao
 
 
 Take this for your hire and take it for yourself! Twenty-five to twenty-five, fifty
 ”hiraaman ko laga, kisi ne aasmaan se dhakelkar dharti par gira diya
 Why someone, this man who carried the box
 kahan se aa gaya? uski jeebh par ai hui baat jeebh par hi rah gai 
 
 iss! dachhina! vah chupchaap khada rahaa
 Hirabai said, "take hold! And listen, come to Rauta company tomorrow morning to meet me
 paas banavaa duungi
 
 
 
 bolte kyon nahin?”lalamohar ne kaha, “ilaam-baksis de rahi he malkin, le lo hiraaman! hiraaman ne katkar lalamohar kii ore dekha
 
 
 
 bolne kaa jaraa bhi dhang nahin is lalamohara ko
 Everyone listened to Dhunniram's welcome, even Hirabai - how could any cartman, except the carriage and the gazelle, see the gimmick? At the fair, Hiraman said, "what will you say!" He tried to laugh company kii aurat company main ja rahi he
 What about Hiraman! The boxer carried forward showing the way - "from here

 lalamohar daudta-haanfata basa par aayaa- “i, i hiraaman, yahan kya baithe ho, chalakar dekho jai-jaikaar ho rahaa he! may baaja-gaja, chhaapi-faharem ke saath hirabai kii jai-jaikaar kar rahaa hoon
 Hiraman woke up
 lahasanawaan ne kaha, “dhunni kaaka, tum basa par raho, main bhi dekh aaun
 "who listens to Dhanni?" teenon jan nautanki company kii elania party ke peeche-peeche chalane lage
 Stopping at every corner, banjo is to be announced
 elaan ke har shabd par hiraaman pulak uthta he
 Hearing Hirabai's name, the name, she patted Lalmohar on the back - "dhanna hai, dhanna hai!" Is it or not? ”lalmohar said,“ Now speak! Still won't see the gimmick? " Right from the morning Dhunniram and Lalmohar were explaining, they had lost by explaining - “go and visit the company
 jate-jate purasis kar gai he
 "but just one thing about Hiraman -" Dutt, who will go to the offering! The woman of the company went to the company
 ab usase kya lenaa-dena! chinhegi bhi nahin!”vah man-hi-man ruthaa hua tha
 After hearing the announcement he said to Lalmohar, "must see, why Lalmohar?" The two consulted each other and Rauta went towards the company
 kheme ke paas pahunchakar hiraaman ne lalamohar ko ishaara kiya, poochtacha karne kaa bhaar lalamohar ke sir
 Lalmohar knows how to speak trash
 lalamohar ne ek kaale kotwale se kaha, “babu sahib, jaraa suniye to!”kaale kotwale ne naak-bhun chadhaakar kaha- “kya he? idhar kyon?”lalamohar kii kacharaahi boli gadabada gai - tevar dekhakar bolaa, “gulgul 
 
 nahin-nahin 
 
 bul-bul 
 
 
 No 
 
 
 
 "hiraman quickly supported -" Where can Hiradevi live, can you tell? " The man's eyes suddenly turned red
 saamne khadey nepali sipaahi ko pukarkar kaha, “in logon ko kyon aane diya idhar?”“hiraaman!” 
 
 vahi phenugilasi aawaaj kidar se ai? kheme ke parade ko hataakar hirabai ne bulaayaa - yahan aa jaao, andar! 
 
 dekho, bahadur! isko pahchaan lo
 This is my Hiraman
 samajhe?”nepali darban hiraaman kii ore dekhakar jaraa muskaraayaa or chalaa gaya
 Going to the black coat man said, "heerabai's man
" nahin rokane bolaa!”lalamohar paan le aayaa nepali darban ke liye - “khaaya jaae!”“iss! ek nahin, paanch paas
 All four stud Said that as long as it is in the fair, come and see every night
 sabakaa khyal rakhti he
 Bid that you and your partner, take a pass for everyone
 company kii auraton kii baat niraali hoti he! he yaa nahin?”lalamohar ne laal kaagaj ke tukdon ko chhukar dekha - “paa-sa! vaah re hiraaman bhai! 
 
 
 But what will happen with five passes? The counterattack has not yet come back yet
 ”hiraaman na kaha, “jane do abhaage ko
 Not written in fate
 
 
 haan, pehle gurukasam khaani hogi sabhi ko, ki gaanv-ghar main yah baat ek panchi bhi na jaan paae
 Lalmohar got excited and said, "who will say that, going to the village?" i will not bring you back from the second time if the reflex reviles
 ”hiraaman ne apni thili aaj hirabai ke jimme rakh di he
 Where is the fair Variety of Pakitakat people come every year
 apane saathi-sangiyon kaa bhi kya bharosa! hirabai maan gai
 He locked the black bag of Hiraman's cloth in his leather box
 bakse ke upar bhi kapade ka khol or andar bhi jhalmal reshmi astr! man kaa maan-abhimaan dur ho gaya
 Lalmohar and Dhunniram together praised Hiraman's wisdom; Praised his fate again and again
 uske bhai or bhabhi kii ninda kii, dabi jabaan se
 Heera's brother is like Hiraman, that's why! Had there been another brother
 
 
 ”lahasanawaan kaa munh lataka hua he
 Hearing Declaration, do not know where the clock has returned after it is very dark
 lalamohar ne ek malikana jhidki di he, gaali ke saath- “sohada kahin kaa!”dhunniram ne chulhe par khichdi chadhaate hue kaha, “pehle yah faisla kar lo ki gaadi ke paas koun rahegaa!” “rahegaa koun, yah lahasanawaan kahan jayega?”lahasanawaan ro pada - “i-e-e maalik, haath jodte hai
 Ekko peep! Just a glimpse! Hiraman said generously, "well, why a glimpse, see an hour
" main aa jaaounga
 "two hours before the gimmick starts, the nagada starts ringing
" or nagada shuru hote hi log patingon kii tarah tuutane lagate hai
 Seeing the crowd near the ticket office, Hiraman got a great laugh - "look Lalmohar, there, what a shocking people!" "hiraman bhai!" "who, counterattack! Where did the lading come from? " Lalmohar asked like a village man
 palatdaas ne haath malate hue maafee maangi - “kasoorbar hai; jo sajaa do tum log, sab manjuur he
 But to be honest, Siya Sukumari
 
 
 
 "the purine of Hiraman's mind has developed on the rhythm of the Nagade
 bolaa, “dekho palata, yah mat samajhnaa ki gaanv-ghar kii janaana he
 Look, i have given a pass for you too Take your pass, look at you ”lalamohar ne kaha, “lekin ek sart par paas milegaa
 In between, also to the laughter
 
 
 ”palatdaas ko kuch bataane kii jarurat nahin
 He has just come to talk to the lord
 lalamohar ne duusari shart saamne rakhi - “gaanv main agar yah baat maaloom hui kisi tarah 
 
 !”“ram-ram!” daant se jeebh ko katate hue kaha palatdaas ne
 Palatadas told- "athaniya gate is here!" Standing at the gate, the concierge took his hand and looked at his face in turn, said, "it is near
" kahan se mila?”ab lalamohar kii kacharaahi boli sune koi! uske tevar dekhakar darban ghabara gaya- “milegaa kahan se? apni company se puch lijie jaakar
 Not only four, see there is one more
 ” jeb se paanchava paas nikaalkar dikhaaya lalamohar ne
 The Nepalese concierge stood at a rupee gate
 hiraaman ne pukarkar kaha, “e sipaahi daaju, subah ko hi pahachanavaa diya or abhi bhul gaye?”nepali darban bolaa, “hirabai kaa aadmi he sab
 let it go
 paas hai to phir kaahe ko roktaa he?”athniya darja!teenon ne kapadghar ko andar se pehali baar dekha
 There are pedestal-bench positions in front
 parade par ram-ban-gaman kii tasaveer he
 Palatadas was recognized
 usne haath jodqar namaskara kiya, parade par ankit ramsia sukumaari or lakhanlala ko
 "jai Ho, Jai Ho!" Paltadas's eyes filled up
 hiraaman ne kaha, “lalamohar, chhaapi sabhi khadey hai yaa chal rahe hai?”lalamohar apane bagal main baithe darshakon se jaan-pahchaan kar chukaa he
 He said, "khela is still inside the curtain
 abhi jaminkaa de rahaa he, log jamaane ke liye
 "palatadas knows how to play the dholak, so Nagade shakes the neck on the beat and cuts the beat on the matchmaker
" bidi aadan-pradaan karke hiraaman ne bhi ekaadh jaan-pahchaan kar lee
 The familiar man of Lalmohar covered the body with the sheet and said, "it is still late to start dancing, till then take a sleep
 
 
 
 Better than all status
 sabase peeche sabase unchi jagah par he
 Hot straw on the ground! Hey hey! Sitting on a pedestal-bench, those watching the Tamasa in this winter season will just wander and wanna drink
 ”us aadmi ne apane sangi se kaha, “khelaa shuru hone par jagaa dena
 No, not when the game started, Hiriya woke us up when he came on stage
 ”hiraaman ke kaleje main jaraa aanch lagi
 
 
 
 heria! bada latapatia aadmi maaloom pasta he
 He told Lalmohar with an eye gesture, "no need to talk to this man
" ”ghan-ghan-ghan-dhadaam! paradaa uth gaya
 Hey, Hey, Hey, Hirabai got off the stage early! The wardrobe is full
 hiraaman kaa munh achraj main khul gaya
 Don't know Lalmohar why this laughter is coming
 hirabai ke geet ke har pad par vah hansataa he, bevajaah
 Gulbadan is sitting in the court
 elaan kar rahi he; jo aadmi takhtahjaraa banaakar laa degaa, munhamaangi cheez inaam main di jaaegi
 
 
 
 aji, he koi aisa fankaar, to ho jaae taiyaar, banaakar laae takhtahjaraa-aa! kidqid-qirri-! albatt naachati he! kya galaa he! maaloom he, yah aadmi kahata he ki hirabai paan-bidi, cigarette-zarda kuch nahin khaati! thik kahati he
 Big name is a prostitute
 koun kahata he ki randi he! daant main missi kahan he
 The tooth would have been washed by the pod
 haragij nahin
 Who is a man, talks about talking! The company woman is called a hooker! Why did you talk? Who is Randi's bhadwa? Beat the bastard! Beat! your 
 
 
 ho-halle ke bich, hiraaman kii aawaaj kapadghar ko phad rahi he- “aao, ek-ek kii gardan utaar lenge
 "lalmohar Dulali is getting beaten up by the people in front of him
" palatdaas ek aadmi kii chaati par savaar he - “saalaa, siya sukumaari ko gaali detaa he, so bhi musalmaan hokar?”dhunniram shuru se hi chup tha
 As soon as the fight started, he escaped from the cloak and ran out
 kaale kotwale nautanki ke manager nepali sipaahi ke saath daude aae
 The officer commenced beating with Hunter
 hunter khaakar lalamohar tilamila uthaa; kacharaahi boli main bhaashan dene laga - “daaroga sahab, maarthe hai, maariye
 There is no harm
 lekin yah paas dekh lijie, ek paas pakit main bhi hai
 Can see hujur tikat nahin, paas!” 
 
 tab ham logon ke saamne company kii aurat ko koi buree baat kare to kaise chod denge?”company ke manager kii samaj main aa gai sari baat
 He explained to the inspector - "huzoor, i get it
 yah sari badmaashi mathuramohan companywaalon kii he
 Infamous the company by creating a fight in the show
 
 No Huzoor, leave these people, he is a man of Hirabai
 bechaari kii jaan khatre main hai
 Had told Hujur, no! ”on hearing Hirabai's name, the inspector left all three
 lekin teenon kii duaali chin lee gai
 The manager placed the three on the pedestal in one rupee position - "you guys sit here
 paan bhijwa detaa hoon
 The wardrobe calmed down and Hirabai returned to the stage
 nagada phir ghanaghna uthaa
 After a while, the three got the idea of dhunniram together - Hey, where did Dhunniram go? "O owner, o boss!" Lahsawan is shouting out of the ward, shouting, "O Lalmohar Ma-li-k!" From Ekatakiya Gate
 ” sabhi darshakon ne lalamohar kii ore mudqar dekha
 Nepalese soldier brought Lahsawan to Lalmohar
 lalamohar ne jeb se paas nikaalkar dikhaa diya
 As soon as Lahswan came, he asked, "master, what was the man saying?" Just say it
 cheharaa dikhalaa dijie, uski ek jhalak!”logon ne lahasanawaan kii chaudi or sapaat chaati dekhi
 Empty body even in winter 
 
 These people are with the disciple-chaat! Lalmohar pacified the laughter
 teenon-chaaron se mat puche koi, nautanki main kya dekha
 How should you remember the story! Hiraman used to think, Hirabai is looking at her from the beginning, looking at her, singing, dancing
 lalamohar ko lagata tha, hirabai usee kii ore dekhati he
 She has understood, Lalmohar is a more powerful man than Hiraman! Paltadas understands the anecdote
 
 
 qissa or kya hoga, raman kii hi baat
 The same Ram, the same Sita, the same Lakhanlal and the same Ravan! Siya comes in various forms like Ravana to snatch Sukumari from Ram ji
 ram or sita bhi rup badal lete hai
 Here too, the son of the gardener who built the throne is Ram
 gulbadan mia sukumaari he
 The gardener's friend is Lakhanlala and the Sultan is Ravan
 dhunniram ko bukhaar he tej! lahasanawaan ko sabase acha joker kaa part laga he 
 
 chiraiya tonhake leki naa jaivai narhat ke bajariya! vah us joker se dosti lagaana chahta he
 Will not make friendship, Joker sir? Hiraman is halfway up a song - "killed Gulfam!" Who was this Gulfman? Hirabai was crying and singing- "oh yes, dead Gulfam!" Tididi Poor Gulpham! Giving back to the trio, the policeman said, "you come to watch dancing with sticks and duels?" The matter spread - Hirabai has run away from the Mathuramohan company, so this time the Mathuramohan company has not come
 
 
 
 His goons have come
 hirabai bhi kam nahin
 Big Khilad is a woman
 teraa-teraa dehati lathait paal rahi he
 
 
 Wow, even if i say my life! Have fun! Ten days
 
 
 din-raat!din-bhar haada dhota hiraaman
 The gimmick of the gimmick would start ringing in the evening
 nagade kii aawaaj sunate hi hirabai kii pukaar kaanon k paas mandraane lagati - bhaiya mita 
 
 
 Hiraman
 
 Master Master! There was always a ring in his corner, all day long
 kabhi hormonium, kabhi nagada, kabhi dholak or kabhi hirabai kii paijani
 Hiraman would rise and walk on the same path
 nautanki company ke manager se lekar paradaa khinchnewale tak usko pahachaanate hai
 
 
 He is a man from Hirabai
 palatdaas har raat nautanki shuru hone ke samay shradhdhapurvak stage ko namaskara karata, haath jodqar
 Lalmohar went to Hirabai one day to narrate his trashy speech
 hirabai ne pahachaanaa hi nahin
 Since then his heart has become smaller
 uskaa naukar lahasanawaan uske haath se nikal gaya he, nautanki company main bhartee ho gaya he
 He befriends the Joker
 din-bhar pani bharta he, kapade dhota he
 He says what is there in the village that will go! Lalmohar remains depressed
 dhunniram ghar chalaa gaya he, biimaar hokar
 Hiraman has arrived at the station three times from this morning
 aaj na jane kyon usko apni bhaujai kii yaad aa rahi he
 
 
 Dhunniram has not said anything, in the stroke of fever! This is how much atar-patter was going on - Gulbadan, takht-hazara! Lehwan is in the lounge
 din-bhar hirabai ko dekhtaa hoga
 Kal was saying, Hiraman Malik, i am very happy with your clan
 hirabai kii sari dhone ke baad kathaute kaa pani attargulab ho jaataa he
 Immerse my pot in it and leave it
 lo, suunghoge? har raat, kisi-na-kisi ke munh se sunata he vah - hirabai randi he
 How many people did he fight! How people speak without seeing it! People also abuse the king behind his back! Today he will meet Heerabai and say, people are very infamous by staying in the gimmick company
 sarakas company main kyon nahi kaam karti? sabake saamne naachati he, hiraaman kaa kalejaa dap-dap jalataa rahata he us samay
 To the tiger in the circus company
 
 Who would dare to go near him! Hirabai will be safe! Where is the car coming? "hiraman, a Hiraman bhai!" Hearing Lalmohar's speech, Hiraman looked at the neck
 
 
 
 What has Lalmohar brought to life? ”hirabai is looking for you on Istiman
 ja rahi he
 "heard in one breath
" lalamohar kii gaadi par hi ai he meley se
 "is she going?" where? Hirabai is leaving by train? ”hiraman opened the car
 malgudaam ke chaukeedaar se kaha, “bhaiya, jaraa gaadi-bail dekhte rahiye
 Are coming ”“ustad!” janaana musafirkhaane ke phatak ke paas hirabai odhani se munh-haath dhakkar khadi thi
 Boosting the bag said, "lo! Oh God! i met, come on, i had lost hope
 tumse ab bhent nahin ho sakegi
 i am going, Master! ”the man carrying the box has become Babasaheb wearing coat and trousers today
 maalikon kii tarah kuliyon ko hukum de rahaa he - “janaana darja main chadhaana
 Good? ”hiraman stood quietly with a bag in his hand
 kurte ke andar se thili nikaalkar di he hirabai ne
 The sac is warm like a bird's body
 “gaadi aa rahi he
 The box taker looked at Hirabai, making his face
 uske chehre kaa bhav spasht he- itnaa zyada kya he?hirabai chanchal ho gai
 He said, "hiraman, come here, inside
" main phir lautakar ja rahi hoon mathuramohan company main
 Company of your country
 vanali mela aaoge na?”hirabai ne hiraaman ke kandhe par haath rakhaa, is baar daahine kandhe par
 Then removing the money from his bag, he said, "buy a hot sheet
" ”hiraaman kii boli phooti, itani der ke baad - “iss! hardam rupaiya-paisa! rakhie rupaiya! kya karenge chadar?”hirabai kaa haath ruuk gaya
 He looked at Hiraman's face closely
 phir boli, “tumhaara ji bahut chota ho gaya he
 Why Mita? The merchant who bought Mahua Ghatwarin has bought Guruji! baksaa dhonevaale ne baahar se aawaaj di - “gaadi aa gai
 Hiraman came out of the room
 baksaa dhonevaale ne nautanki ke joker-jaisaa munh banaakar kaha, “latfaaram se baahar bhaago
 If caught without a ticket, then air for three months
 
 
 ”hiraaman chupchaap phatak se baahar jaakar khada ho gaya
 
 
 Tisson's talk, the secret of the railway! Otherwise Hiraman would straighten the mouth of this box taker
 hirabai thik samnevaali kothri main chadhi
 This So much tan! Even sitting in the car, looking towards Hiraman, tukur-tukur
 lalamohar ko dekhakar ji jal uthta he, hameshaa peeche-peeche; hardam hissaadari soojhati he
 The vehicle blew the whistle
 hiraaman ko laga, uske andar se koi aawaaj nikalakar siti ke saath upar kii ore chali gai - ku-uu-uu! i-ssa!-chhi-i-i-chakk! gaadi hili
 Hiraman crushed the thumb of his right foot with the eddy of the left foot
 kaleje kii dhadqan thik ho gai
 Hirabai wipes her face with purple saffi
 saafee hilaakar ishaara karti he 
 
 ab jaao
 The last box passed; Platform empty all empty
 
 
 khokhale 
 
 malgadee ke dibbe! duniya hi khaali ho gai maano! hiraaman apni gaadi ke paas laut aayaa
 Hiraman asked Lalmohar, "how long are you returning to the village?" Lalmohar said, "what will you do going to the village now?" Here is a chance to earn freight! Hirabai is gone, the fair will now be broken
 ”- “acchhee baat
 Want to pay someone home? ”lalmohar tried to convince Hiraman
 lekin hiraaman ne apni gaadi gaanv kii ore janevaali sadq kii ore mod di
 Now what is going on in the fair! Hollow Mela! Raw road of bullock cart is far from the side of railway line
 hiraaman kabhi rail par nahin chadhaa he
 In his mind, the old craving once again, the desire to go to jagarnath-dham, riding on the train, singing the song
 ulatakar apane khaali tappar kii ore dekhne kii himmat nahin hoti he
 Even today, the back feels tickling
 aaj bhi rah-rahakar champa kaa phool khil uthta he, uski gaadi main
 On the broken link of a song, the rhythm of the song is cut, again and again! He looked back, not even sacks, not even bamboo, not even tigers - Pari Devi
 
 
 mita 
 
 hiradevi 
 
 mahua ghatwarin - ko-i nahin
 The dead voices of dead Muhurto want to be vocal
 hiraaman ke hont hill rahe hai
 Perhaps he is swearing a third - the lad of the woman of the company
 hiraaman ne hathaat apane donon belon ko jhidki di, duaali se maare hue bolaa, “railway line kii ore ulat-ulatakar kya dekhte ho?” donon belon ne kadam kholkar chaal pakadi
 Hiraman muttered - "oh yes, killed Gulfam

 The Modi government has decided to replace the current five-year plan with a 15-year plan
 maujuuda panchavarshiya yojana agle saal march tak chalegi

 The midterm appraisal 'NDA' will be reviewed every three years in 2019-20 and its midterm appraisal will be in 2019-20
 isi samay aglaa finance kamishan aword lagu kiya jayega or nai loksabhaa bhi chuni jaaegi
 According to the source associated with the PMO, the government wants to strengthen the availability of economic resources by linking this agenda with the Finance Commission

 India topped the medal table in this game

 When 12-year-old Mirabai had lifted the bundle of wood, India's national coach Vijay Sharma said, "there is a hard work for the last four years behind this performance
" hamane prashikshan ke tareekon main badlaav kiye or khilaadiyon ke aahaar main bhi
 'he said,' Every player has the same diet in the mess of Sai, but different sports require different doses

 Lather, who became the youngest Indian weightlifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games, said, "why do players cheat, because they are not good enough
" hamane unki khuraaq kaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa 
 The Indians' performance may have been memorable at the Commonwealth Games, but the lack of a full-time physio was certainly missed
 sharma ne kaha ,‘ham kal plus 105 kilo main bhi padak jeet sakate the, lekin gurdeep singh kii qamar main takalif thi or physio bahut jaruri tha
 We have written to the authorities that this should not happen in future, hopefully we will be heard after this performance

 sarkaar ke sutron kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki eietisel kii bikri se jo rakam milegi, uskaa upyog air india ke karj kaa bhugtan karne main kiya jayega
 How much is the debt on Air India? Let us know that Air India has a debt of more than 50 thousand crores, for which efforts were being made to disinvest in the company

 Earlier, it was decided to sell 76 percent shares of Air India but no company came forward for this till 31 May
 iske baad is thande baste main daal diya gaya
 There is no target to meet the target somewhere, so questions are being raised as to why the government decided to have a subsidiary of few crores
 yah jaananaa rochak hoga ki sarkaar ne is vitt varsh main vinievesh se 8 xxrep 4 0 karod kaa torget rakhaa he lekin abhi 16000 karod hi jutaaye ja sake hai
 The government is also preparing itself for the question that the sale of Air India subsidiary company will also raise questions

 One of the films released at the box office this week is 'intaad'
 aparnaa singh dwaara nirdeshit is film main ahm bhoomika main naseerauddin shah, arshad varsi, divya datta, sagarika ghatge, sharad kelkar or divakar kumaar hai
 The makers of 'intaad' are Falguni Patel and Prince Soni
 is film ke nirmaataa or nirdeshak donon hi 'iraadaa' se apane filmi safar kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 This film is an eco-thriller i
e
 keeping the atmosphere in view, the story has been adapted as a thriller
 'iraadaa' kii kahani bhathinda main ghatati he jahaan ritred army afasar parbajit singh (naseerauddin shah) apni beti riya (romana molla) ke saath rahata he or wo use sidies kii pariksha ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa he
 But one day he learns that Riya has cancer which is the reason for the water in this state, which is polluting the drinking water of the region due to reverse boring
 unhen pataa chalata he ki riya hi nahi balkee is pradesh main ye beemaari buree tarah se fail chuki he or film main iske khilaaf kai log khadey hote hai
 But who are these people and how do they deal with this difficulty and how do they face the corporate world and politics associated with it, you should watch this film to see it
 ye film manoranjan ke saath-saath aapako reverse boring jaise muddon or uske parinaam se bhi avgat karaati he
 At the same time, i would also like to praise the producer and director of this film who did not get caught up in the magic of the film world and made a film based on one issue
 acchhee baat yah he ki unhone ise puri eemaandaaree se anjaam diya he
 Now let's talk about the shortcomings and strengths of this film
 pehle is film kii khaamiyon kii baat karen to, madhyantar se pehle film kii likhaai mujhe kamjor lagi phir chaahe wo script ho yaa scrinple
 Especially the track with Diwakar and Sagarika Ghatge
 inke kirdaar or drishy pair jamaane se pehle hi ukhd jate hai
 The audience is unable to connect with these characters and neither can they reciprocate with them and in the meantime Diwakar's character also ends
 aise main darshak kirdaar se jud nahin pate
 Apart from this, there are many scenes in the first half which are cut before reaching the peak, due to which the whole scene becomes ineffective
 kuch jagah aisa lagata he ki lekhak or nirdeshak bina bhav ke apni baat kehane kii jaldi main hai
 Apart from all this, where special effects have been used in the film, it is clear that VFX has been used here
 mujhe yah bhi lagata he ki 'reverse boring' or baaki takneekee shabdon ko aasaan karne kii zarurat thi, taaki jo log angreji nahin jaanate unhen reverse boring kii puri prakriya behatar tareeke se samaj aa jaae
 This film was lacking in flaws and now it is about merits
 tippaniyan The biggest feature of this film is its theme which is not only new to the film world, but it also warns the audience of a new danger
 ye film or iskaa vishay reverse boring jaise khatre kii ore system-sarkaar donon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne kii koshish karti he or yah bhi bataati hai ki agar is taraf samay rahete dhyaan nahin diya gaya to bhavishya bhayaavah ho saktaa he
 The second feature of the film is Arshad Warsi as NIA officer Arjun Mishra
 arshad apane abhinay ke dam par badi khubsuurati se is sanjeeda vishay main bhi halkaa kamedi kaa tadakaa laga rahe hai or is film ko bojhil hone se bachaa rahe hai
 But even after a light comedy, he has not deviated from the story or the issue
 naseer ek baar phir apane bahtareen abhinay se film main jaan daalate hai, unki or arshad kii jodi 'ishkia' or 'dedh ishkiyaan' kii tarah mazaahia to nahin he par in donon ke seens behad prabhaavshaalee hai
 At the same time, Divya Dutta and Sharad Kelkar also have great acting
 in donon ne film ke negative kirdaaron ko khubasarati ke saath parde par utaara he
 After the first half of the mid-day, both the writing and the direction of the film has a sharp edge and the film becomes effective
 film kii cinemetography film ke marm or vishay ko or sahaara detii he
 Also, i would like to mention here another scene which depicts cancer patients being taken on the train
 ye seen aapkaa dil dahala detaa he
 Its filming is Kabil-e Tarif

 i got it three stars
 is film kii sabase badi khubi he iskaa vishay jo film jagat ke liye to nayaa he hi saath hi ye darshakon ko ek nae khatre se saavdhaan karata he
 This film and its subject tries to attract the attention of both the system-government towards the danger of reverse boring and also suggests that the future can be frightening if it is not given due attention in time
 film kii duusari khubi hai arshad varsi jo enie officer arjuna mishra ke kirdaar main hai
 Arshad, on the strength of his acting, is also putting a light comedy on this serious subject and saving this film from being cumbersome
 lekin kamedi ke halke put ke baad bhi vah kahani yaa mudde se kahin nahin bhatke hai
 Naseer once again lives on in the film with his acting, his and Arshad's pairing of Ishqiya and Dedh Ishqiya are not as funny but their scenes are very impressive
 vahiin divya datta or sharad kelkar kaa bhi umdaa abhinay he
 Both of them have cast the negative characters of the film on the screen with great enthusiasm
 madhyatanr ke pehle ke aadhe hisse ke baad film kii likhaai or nirdesan donon main dhar najar aati he or film asardaar ho jaati he
 The cinematography of the film lends further support to the film's core and subject
 saath hi main yahaan ek or drishy kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga jisamen cancer ke marijon ko rail main le jate darshaya gaya he
 This scene makes your heart tremble

 jahaan sabase zyada anderworld hai vahaan sabase zyada investment yaa puunji nivesh kyon hota he? ye sawaal bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bihar ke vyapaariyon or udyogpatiyon se shakruuvaar ko ek kaarykram main poocha
 Nitish was speaking at an event organized on the 90th birth anniversary of Bihar Chamber of Commerce
 haalanki is samaaroh main uparashtrapati hamid ansaari mukhya atithi the, lekin nitish ne apane bhaashan main rajya main nivesh ko lekar bhadaas nikaali
 On the question being raised towards the law and order of the state, Nitish Kumar said that after every crime, the state government takes immediate action and even from the crime statistics, the situation in Bihar is better than other states
 rajya main nivesh kii sambhaavna hai
 He said that the people of Bihar earn a lot of money by going out, but if they put money in a little bit of Bihar too, the state will also benefit and the chances of employment in the state will increase
 nitish ne baar-baar apane bhaashan main rajya ke upadyogpatiyon ko radimaid garment ke kshetra main nivesh karne or bihar main isaki sambhaavna talashne kii apil kii, kyonki unke anusaar jab bangladesh is kshetra main itnaa bada centre ban saktaa hai tab bihar main bhi mehanatakash logon kii apaar sankhya hai
 According to Nitish, there was a lack of infrastructure in the state in the past, but it has improved a lot and referring to the power sector, he said that people are now installing air-conditioners in rural areas of Bihar
 tippaniyan At the same time, Vice President Hamid Ansari in his speech advised the state government to keep its focus on law and order and to create the necessary environment for investment in the state
 hamid ansaari kii maane to vartmaan vikaas dar se bihar ko kam se kam viksit rajyon kii shrenee main aane main abhi bhi do dashak lag jaaenge
 The ceremony also included the top five industrialists of the state and Anil Aggarwal of Vedanta even announced that in the days to come, he has started talks with the state government for investment in many sectors in the state
 anil agarwal patna ke hi rahane vaale hai or rajya kii kanoon vyavastha ke bare main kaha ki jo krime bihar main hai vah bahut chhitput he
 But Anil Aggarwal admitted that both the Nitish government and the central government are very strong at present
 nitish kumaar ne rajya kii kanoon vyavastha ke prati uthaae ja rahe sawaal par kaha ki har aparaadh ke baad rajya sarkaar tatkaal karwaai karti he or aparaadh ke aankadon se bhi dekhen to anya rajyon se bihar kii sthiti acchhee he
 There are chances of investment in the state
 unhone kaha ki bihar ke log baahar jaakar khub paisa kamaate hai, lekin agar wo thodaa-modaa bihar main bhi paisa lagaayenge to rajya kaa bhi bhala hoga or rajya main rojgaar kii sambhaavna badhegi
 In his speech, Nitish repeatedly appealed to the state's industrialists to invest in readymade garment and explore the possibility of it in Bihar, because according to him, when Bangladesh can become such a big center in this area, Bihar will also have a toil of working people

 Dr Doval, a geologist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, said that a few days ago, the Rudraprayag district administration gave us an information, under which some people had gone about 5 km from Kedarnath where a lake was being built in the middle of the glacier The matter has been told
 lekin jo jhil bataai ja rahi he, vah chorabadi jhil nahin he kyonki chorabadi jhil kedarnath se maatr 2 kilometre kii duuri par he
 But the lake that is being told remains in the middle of the glacier
 yah kedarnath se 5 kilometre kii duuri par he
 On the other hand, IG Sanjay Gunjyal, who is commanding the SDRF in the state, is considering it as a minor thing
 saath hi wadiya ke vaigyanik ne bataaya ki wo kedarnath main pichley 10 saalon se kaam kar rahe hai or chorabadi jhil ke punaruddhar kii koi bhi sambhaavna nahin he
 Because in 2013 Kedarnath Dham disaster, the Chorabari lake was completely destroyed by the disaster
 ab aise main chorabadi jhil ke punerjeevit kaa koi sawaal hi paidaa nahi hota he
 Also told that they think it is some other glacier-made lake, for this they will be able to comment on it on the spot
 vaigyanik ne bataaya ki jab glacier pighalta he to jagah-jagah choti-choti jhilein ban jaati hai
 More glaciers are expected to be formed this year as there is a lot of rain and snowfall this time
 is vajah se abhi glacier pigal rahe hai or vahiin ikattha hokar chote-chote jhil bana lete hai lekin in jhiilon se koi khatre vaali baat nahin he lekin jo chorabadi dobaaraa banane kii baat kii ja rahi he aisi koi baat nahin he
 In the report released after the disaster, earlier it was said that Chorbari lake cannot be revived
 chorabadi jhil yaa phir koi anya jhil ho tabaahi machaane ke liye kisi naam kii darkaar nahin he, pani jis tarah se ek badi jhil kaa aakaar le rahaa he wo vaaki abhi se suraksha ke upaay karne ke liye ek sanket he
 Significantly, the bursting of Lake Chorabadi was considered to be the main reason for the mass destruction in Kedarnath in the 2013 disaster, as flooding in the Mandakini valley, the lake water mixed with debris and boulder caused widespread destruction in the city

 At the commencement of the House meeting, as soon as the Chairman Mohammad Hamid Ansari announced to start the Question Hour, BJP members started shouting slogans demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over alleged corruption within the government and came before the seat
 sabhapati ne asana ke samaksh naare laga rahe sadasyon se kaha ki vah apane sthanon par laut jaaen or prashnkaal chalane den
 He said, 'let the Question Hour run at any time

 ustad bismillah khan, shehanai or banaras
 
 
 These three names are so interlinked that their identity cannot be separated from any one
 shehanai ke jaadugar bismillah khan sahab ko is duniya ko alavida kahe 11 saal puure ho gaye lekin unka makbara ab bhi udghaatan kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Khan Saheb was remembered with rose petals on his death anniversary
 21 agast 2006 ko bharat ratna bismillah khan ke intkaal ke baad unki supurd-e-kaaq kii rasm banaras kii phatman dargah main hui
 The then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone tab ustad bisamillah khan ke sammaan main kai elaan kiye the
 Such as his tomb being built, the ghat named after him, his statue erected at the station, etc
 mulaayam singh ke bete 2012 main upi ke mukhyamantri bane to unhone bismillah khan sahab ke makbare ke liye 29 lakh rupye ke prastaav ko manjuuri di
 The tomb of Ustad Bismillah Khan is definitely ready, but there are definitely questions regarding the quality of construction here
 dargah ke mukhya dwaar kaa jirnoddar hone ke saath makbare ko chat bhi naseeb ho gai
 Now it is different that despite the new construction, the roof of the mausoleum started lime in the rain
 kshetreey saanskrithik centre pramukh dow
 According to Ratnesh Verma, due to repeated additions to the mausoleum, its work is not being completed
 mul kaam se kaam kaaphi bad gaya
 According to Verma, if no other work is added, then the inauguration of the mausoleum will be written to the government in a month
 verma ne ye bhi kaha kii makbare kii chat se jahaan licage thi use durust kara diya gaya he
 At the same time, Ustad Bismillah Khan's family and fans are not happy about the quality of construction of the mausoleum
 unka kahana he ki ye samaj se pare he ki 29 lakh rupye kahaan kharch kar die gaye
 Afaq Haider, grandson of Ustad Bismillah Khan said that due to the heritage of Banaras, many people come to see Khan Saheb's ancestral home, but it is difficult to walk due to encroachment on the way to there
 haidar ke mutabik sarkaar ko is taraf bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 Let me tell you that one and a half years ago, under the UNESCO Necrative Cities of Network, Banaras was given the title of 'city of Music'
 isamen banaras kii sangithik thati ko sangrakshit karne kaa uddeshy nihit tha
 Those in key positions from Lucknow to Delhi promised that memories related to Banaras music and its funkars would be enriched and preserved
 isamen kalakaaron ke awaason or aasapaas ke ilaakon ko sajaane-sanvaarane kii baat thi, lekin hairat kii baat he is fehrist main shehanai ke jaadugar bismillah khan kaa naam to aayaa hi nahin
 However, the family and fans of Ustad Bismillah Khan are waiting for the hands of the government to come to Benares and not only inaugurate the tomb of Khan Saheb but also promise to save his heritage

 In Rajasthan, Bharatiya Janata Party state president Madanlal Saini has been mired in controversies regarding his statement on Babur and Humayun and due to this statement a debate has started on the truth of the pages of history
 saini ne 24 july ko kaha- "jahaan tak mujhe pataa he jab humayun mar rahaa tha usne babar ko bulaakar kaha ki tumhen hindustan par raaj karnaa he to ek baat hameshaa dhyaan rakhana
 Always respecting cows, Brahmins and women
 "yah tippanee unhone alvar main mob linching kii ghatana par apni pratikriya dete hue kii
 a person belonging to a minority community carrying a cow in Alwar was surrounded and beaten up by the guards after which he died
 is ghatana ko lekar bhaajapa ke rajya or centre sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he
 Saini made this comment while expressing her reaction in Jaipur on the same issue
 haalanki alvar kii ghatana par tippanee karte hue madanlaal kai galatiyaan kar gaye
 First, they told the father to be the son and the son to the father
 sach yah he ki babar ke bete kaa naam humayun tha
 But he told Humayun the father of Babur
 humayun ke naam babar kii asli vasiyatadusri tathyaatmak galati yah he ki babar ne humayun ko gaay ke bare main to naseehat di thi
 But Madanlal Saini added women and Brahmins on his behalf
 darasal, babar or humayun ke bich aise patrachaar kaa jo vivaran aitihaasik sakshya ke taur par uplabdh he, wo he humayun ke naam babar kii vasiyat
 In this will, Babur has presented Humayun's lesson to us here
 vasiyat main babar ne kaha tha, “betaa, hindustan kii sarazamiin main har mazahab ko maanane vaale log rahete hai
 Alhamdolillah has been entrusted to you the king of this country
 apane dil se bhedbhaav dur kar ke insaaf karo
 Especially do not sacrifice the cow
 isse tum hindustan ke logon kaa dil jeet loge or log badshahath se judenge
 Do not demolish the prayers of those living in the Sultanate
 itnaa barabari kaa insaaf karo ki log apane badshaah se khush hon or badshaah logon se
 Islam will move with softness, not with the sword of oppression
 shiya-sunni jhagadon kii taraf se aankh moond lo varanaa islam kamjor hoga
 Different sections of the Sultanate are like the four elements of jism
 sultanate kii sehat inke talmail par tiki he
 The example of Hazrat Amir Timur Sahib Kiran should always be in front of you
 isse sultanate ko majboot karne main madad milegi
 "we find mention of this episode in the novel" Akbar "by senior journalist and writer Shazi Zaman
 aitihaasik tathyon par aadhaarit yah upanyaas apneaap main ek anuthi koshish he us samay ke itihaas ko logon tak pahunchane kii
 The novel is like a historical and authentic document in view of the kind of misconceptions about Akbar and the Mughal period
 upanyaas varsh 2016 main raajakmal prakaashan kii ore se chapa gaya tha
 Debate on historical facts: There are many facts about the history of Mughal period and there are mutual contradictions among historians
 unheen main se ek he babar kii vasiyat kii pramanikta kaa
 Some historians believe that Babur's will in Humayun's name is not authentic
 vahiin madhyakaalin itihaas ke sabase bade itihaaskaaron main se ek, khaliq ahamed nizami is vasiyat ko pramanik maanate hai or ise apni prasiddh pustak- ‘akbar and relizan’ main shaamil bhi karte hai
 Shazi Zaman presents this will in his book from Khaliq's research
 ajtak se baatcheet main unhone bataaya, “nijaami sahab pratishthit itihaaskaar hai
 He believes that Abul Fazal did not mention it in the Akbar Nama because he did not want Akbar to be seen doing anything that someone had done before
 "kuch log aisa kehete hai ki abul fazal ne iskaa zikr akbarnama main nahin kiya
 But his reason was that Abul Fazl wanted to make Akbar's height bigger than the rulers before him
 wo aisa nahin chaahate the ki akbar kuch aisa kehete nazar aaen jo pehle koi kah chukaa ho
 "it was Maharana, not Akbar, who fought for self-respect even in that period: In the continuous response on social media since the remarks of CM Yogimadanlal Saini, many people are saying that between Babur and Humayun No historical evidence of dialogue is available
 jabaki kai itihaaskaar aisa maanate hai ki khaliq kii kitaab main jis vasiyat kaa zikr he, wo sahi he
 But Madanlal Saini appears trapped in both the situations
 agar yah baat itihaas main kahi hi nahin gai to phir madanlaal ise kahaan se kah gaye
 And if the will is correct, then where did it bring the reference of Brahmin and women in it
 phir humayun ne babar ko bulaakar kaha vaali baat to puri tarah se galat hi he
 It is clear from what is written in the will referred to, that Babur advised Humayun that the sacrifice of cow in India is not right, the worship of any sect, temples etc
 should not be harmed and rule should be made based on equality
 upi sarkaar har saal 5 navdith kaviyon ko degi gopaldaas niraj puraskarababar kii is salaah main aman or bhaichaare kii buniyaad par hindustan main hukumat kaayam rakhane kii salaah di gai he
 Madanlal Saini has introduced this reference by breaking and changing it as per his convenience
 bhartiya janata party kii ore se aisi suvidhajanya or galat jaankaree dene kaa yah koi pehla maamla bhi nahin he
 Due to its convenience or ignorance of history, many party leaders have been telling it differently
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi apane bhaashanon main itihaas ke sandarbhon ko saajha karte hue galtiyaan kar chuke hai
 Why have the Chinese set up tents in Demchek and Chumar in Ladakh? Why are Chinese soldiers occupying our land? This question is being eaten by every Indian
 elesi par bharat or china ke bich tanatani kyon badhati ja rahi he, jabaki chini raashtrapati shi jinping haal hi main bhartiya mehmanvaaji ke mureed hokar swadesh laute hai
 Indeed, the answer to this question is hidden in a statement by Chinese President Xi Jinping
 jinping ravivaar ko jab pipuls libration army ke cmanderon se kshetreey ladaai jeetne ke liye apni kshamta ko or dhardaar banane kii baat kar rahe the, to unka frestrishan saaf jhalak rahaa tha
 Xi Jinping failed to tie Prime Minister Narendra Modi to his entourage on a recent visit
 jinping chaahate the ki hind or bhartiya pradhanmantri japan ke saath apane sambandhon kii garmaahat ko kam rakhen or dhire chalem
 But Modi did not fall into Jinping's web
 lihaaja china ne elesi par apane sainikon ko khadaa kar diya, taaki bhartiya japan ke saath zyada aage naa bad paaen
 The English newspaper Times of India has published news to this effect
 pashchim ke ek rajanyik ke mutabik shi jinping bharat par sainya dabaav banaae rakhana chaahate hai, taaki vah japan se dur hi rahen
 Embracing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that Xi Jinping had asked the commanders of the People's Liberation Army to sharpen their capacity to win regional battles in the era of information technology
 bharat or china ke bich ladakh main kai morchon par is samay tanatani chal rahi he
 According to a diplomat living in Beijing, Japan is moving towards militarization
 vahiin, majboot leader ke taur par modi kaa aagaman or in sabake bich japani pradhanmantri shinjo abe ke saath unki dosti china ke liye sabase buree cheez ho sakati he
 So Xi Jinping has kept military pressure on India to keep Japan away from India
 adhikari kaa kahana tha ki is kshetra main china apni shreshthata sabit karne ke liye machal rahaa he
 He said that in this regard, you can also see the close fight between Chinese fighter aircraft and American war planes last month
 ek duusare rajanyik ne bharat-china ke bich sainya morche par jari tanaav par kaha, 'japan se bharat ko dur rakhane ke liye china kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 Whether he tempts India, threatens or anything, he can
 taaki bharat japan se dur rahen
 'he said,' China is committed to becoming a regional force in Asia
 lekin bharat-japan kii dosti uske mansoobey ko dhwast kar sakati he
 ' firdaus ne kaha, sikh dharm ke kai adarsh islam ke samankartarpur coridor par imran khan kaa rukh safakashmir ke baad ab pakistan ne sikhon ko lubhaane kii chaal chali he
 After being criticized for converting a Sikh girl, Firdaus Ashiq Awan, the special assistant of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, said that many ideals of Sikhism are similar to Islam

 The forces that spread hatred can massacre Sikhs in the Golden Temple, oppress Muslims in Kashmir
 vahiin kartarpur coridor par awan ne kaha ki pradhanmantri imran khan kaa faisla pakistan main alpsankhyakon ke adhikaron or dharmik swatantraaa ke bare main unki soch ko darshata he
 He said, i hope you guys will attend the inauguration ceremony and show the world the true face of Pakistan
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kai manchon par bihar ke vikaas kaa daawa kar chuke hai
 This is also true and many people have believed that the picture of Bihar is changing, but it is also a reality that more than 81 percent of Bihar households still do not have toilets
 yah aankada bihar ke vikaas kii hakeekat ko bayaan kar rahaa he
 The government, however, has taken the initiative to build a door-to-door toilet and the chief or public representatives have been made compulsory to build toilets in the houses to contest elections
 aisa nahin ki shauchalay ko lekar logon main jaagarukta nahin he
 Women in Bihar have become more aware of toilets and now they do not want to go to the homes that do not have toilets
 gaya jile ke lakhanpur panchayat kii rahane vaali lalita in dinon gaanv main shauchalay banane se khush he
 She says that earlier defecation on someone's land caused controversy
 isi samasya ko dekhte hue ek swayamsevi sanghathan ne panchayat main kareeb 160 shauchalayon kaa nirmaan karavaaya he
 She says that earlier, toilets were made in the poor's house with plastic sheets
 duusari taraf, aurangabad jile ke neura gaanv kii rahane vaali amisha khud nityakriya main asuvidha kii pidaa sehate-sehate ajiz aa gai hai, lekin vah apni devraani ko shauchalay kaa tohfa dena chaahati hai
 She says that her brother-in-law's marriage is fixed but she does not want her brother-in-law to be bothered about the routine
 vah kahati hai ki unke ghar main shauchalay kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he or yah shauchalay vah devraani ko tohfe main dengi
 They say that going out in the open for defecation is the most troublesome reason
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki ek taraf to bahu ko ghunghat main rahane kii naseehat di jaati he or duusari ore use baahar khule main baithkar beparda hona padataa he
 Well, this story is not only about Lalitha or Amisha
 rajya ke prayek kshetra main kamobesh haalat yahi he
 This is the story of 21st century Bihar where the founder of Sulabh International born on earth
 windeshwar pathak shauchalay nirmaan ko ek andolan kaa rup dekar kai antarrashtriya puraskaron se navaaje ja chuke hai
 However, there has been awareness among people
 kam aay vaale log sarkaar dwaara chalaai ja rahi yojanaon ke tahat shauchalay banane kii baat kar rahe hai
 State Rural Development Minister Nitish Mishra said that now the government is giving 9100 rupees for the construction of toilets
 unhone kaha ki manaregaa yojana se 4500 rupee or nirmal bharat abhiyaan ke tahat 4600 rupee die ja rahe hai
 The beneficiary himself has to spend only Rs 900
 mantri kehete hai ki sarkaar ne nirmal gram or prakhand banane ke liye kai puraskaron kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The Panchayats, which will have toilets in all houses, will be given the Nirmal Gram Puraskar and the blocks in which 100 percent of the houses will have toilets
 use nirmal prakhand puraskaar diya jayega
 25 lakhs will be given to such blocks
 nitish mishra bataate hai ki chaalu vittvarsh main 10 lakh shauchalay nirmaan kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 a target has been set to free Bihar from open defecation by the year 2022
 mantri bhi maanate hai ki bihar main 17
 Only 6 percent of the households have toilets
 vah kehete hai ki sarkaar ne panchayat or nagarpalika chunaav ladane vaale janpratinidhiyon ko apane ghar main shauchalay nirmaan karana anivaary kar diya he, ab jin pratinidhiyon ke ghar main vyaktigat shauchalay nahin hoga, ve chunaav ladane ke ayogy ho jaaenge
 The ban on SMS from prepaid mobile phones in Jammu and Kashmir has been lifted from today
 pradesh sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko yah ahm faisla liya tha

 varsh 2019 main bhi bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ko desh ke most wonted aatankiyon kii talash rahi
 In the same year, when the first list of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act i
e
 UAPA was released in the Parliament, the names of four most wanted terrorists of the country were recorded in it
 ye wo aatanki hai, jinhone hindustan ko sabase zyaada khun ke aansu rulaae hai
 Whose hands are covered with blood of hundreds of innocents from Parliament attack to Pulwama attack and from Uri to Mumbai

 Red corner notices have also been issued to the names of these four most wanted terrorists
 ye chaar aatanki hai- masood azhar, hafiz said, jacki ur rahamaan lakhvi or bharat kaa most wonted anderworld don daaud ibrahim
 The exploits of these four are written in the color of blood
 inhen duniyabar ke saath-saath bharat ne bhi aatanki kaa khitaab diya he
 However, it is a matter of pride for them because a title has been added to their bio-data of terror

 Terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar is the first biodata of Masood Azhar

 To contact this, you will have to talk to ISI i

 There are vacancies in all 272 wards, so the expectations of every small and big leader of the party have increased

 To keep the mind of the workers, the BJP had opened application counters at many places, where so far more than thirty five thousand people have applied for the ticket

 It is being told that all the important documents passed through this officer's desk

 The night before the battle of Kurukshetra began, Bhishma, the commander of the Kauravas, held his tents in his tent
 unhone dharm yuddh main donon pakshon ke liye niyam tay kiye
 There was a rule in them & "nobody will attack each other at night
 ”bhishma ne yakeenan is saal 2 janvari ko pathankot vaayu sena ke thikaane par chaar aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf javaabi sainya karrwai ko dharm yuddh qaraar diya hota
 This action was stopped every night during the three days
 apni aasteenon par saje bhagwaan krishna ke chakra kii marfat vedavyas ke mahakavy ke saath jude, rashtriya suraksha guard (enesji) ke kaali sooti vardidhari commando ke paas bhishma ke dharm yuddh ke niyam kaa paalan karne ke alaava koi chaara bhi nahin tha
 They did not have long-range viewing equipment at night, nor did they have handheld thermal imager, which would enable them to hunt and chase terrorists at night
 unke paas drone bhi nahin the, jo sandigdhon ke nishandehi vaale ilaakon ke upar chautarafa nigaah rakhte hue lagaataar ud sakate the
 There was also no command center from where they could monitor the progress of the operation
 tis par kisi mitra sipaahi kii goli se maare jane (blue-on-blue ghatana) kaa dar unke sir par savaar tha, kyonki vah 2,200 acre main failaa airbase vaayu sena ke garud commando or bhartiya sena ke javaanon yani aise suraksha balon se bharaa hua tha, jinhone kabhi saath milakar koi oparation nahin chalaaya tha
 The operation started again with full vigor at the end of the day
 vaayu sena ke us thikaane ko khatre se puri tarah mukt karne main enesji ke 200 commando ko 70 ghante se zyada vakt laga
 This was a delay which was bound to have political and diplomatic consequences
 oparation jis tarah se chalaaya gaya, usase airbase main enesji ko bhejne ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ke 1 janvari ke faisle par sawalia nishaan khadey ho gaye
 Senior military officials expressed doubts about how appropriate it was to send the NSG for the challenge
 unki raay main sthaneey sena kii tukdishaan oparation ko zyada teji se or zyada kaabiliyat se khatm kar sakati thim
 The Prime Minister had to visit the airbase on 9 January to clear the doubts of failure in coordination and to announce the success of the operation, which had not happened before
 baari gahamagahami se bhare is oparation main is zyada bade sawaal kaa jawaab nahin hi mila ki is makasad ke liye enesji feet tha yaa nahin
 a plan to modernize a total of Rs 1,400 crore would have transformed the NSG into a modern combat force by 2017, but the plan has become more of a fantasy
 enesji aisa bal he, jo barason kii andekhi ke chalate bheetar se khokhla ho chukaa he or ek sankat se duusare sankat ke bich lagaataar jhulata rahata he
 The road to Pathankot started from Mumbai on November 26, 2008, and exposed the weaknesses of the major anti-terror force
 uske baad se enesji apane commando ke liye mahaj sniper riflein, sabamshin gan or pistaulen hi hasil kar sakaa he
 Force multipliers or high-tech equipment that increase capacity manifold are still stuck in paper proposals
 misaal ke liye, pathankot main bal ko chakkar katate vaayu sena ke emi-35 jangi vimaanon par nirbhar rahanaa padaa, jinhone 2,200 acre ke vaayu sena thikaane main aatankwaadiyon ko khojane ke liye apane thermal imageron kaa istemaal kiya
 Helicopters in the grasses as high as elephants in the airbase often detected wild boars, the fastest moving traces
 enesji ne gahan chaanbin ke makasad se oparation chalaane ke liye bakhtarband gadibhan sthaneey sainya ikaayiyon se udhaar leen
 He did not have any command post from where the officers could direct and conduct the operation
 yah jangal yuddh oparation or sena jise imarti ilaakon main ladaai kahati he, donon kaa ajeebogareeb mishran tha
 "we were lucky to be able to stop the terrorists from reaching the technical area," says an officer who participated in the operation
 ” suraksha balon kii khushkismati main jin baton ne ijapha kiya, ve thim-dephence sarvice kor ke santari maanad captain fateh singh kii bemisaal or avishwasaneey javaabi ladaai, jo aatankwaadiyon se bhid gaye or unamem se ek ko maar daalaa; aatankwaadiyon kaa naakaaraapan, jo vaayu sena ke motor transport pool main teji se ghuste-ghuste ruk gaye, is tarah unke sabase ahm nishane-takneekee ilaake main khadey ladaaku vimaan or jangi jahaaj-unki najar se chook gaye
 These officials say, "we can't be so lucky in the next attack
" ” grih mantralay ke pravaktaa ne india today kii prashnawali kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Blind jambajnsg is a specialized attack force of the Ministry of Home Affairs, specially designed to deal with situations of terror or kidnapping
 phir bhi is aakhri astr kii varshon se upeksha ko vaayu sena ke apane agrim morche ke thikaane ko aatankwaadiyon se bachaane main nikammepan ne khulkar ujagar kar diya
 In Pathankot, the terrorists easily hoisted a 10-foot-high wall and hid in the tall grass for the whole day before attacking the main target
 unka mukhya nishaanaa sena ke jawan or takneekee ilaake main khadey vimaan the
 Only Air Force commandos, army and NSG personnel could stop them
 enesji ke jawan shaareerik mandandon, vetan or bhatton-commando peeth par 20 kilo ke saamaan ke saath 24 kimi kii daud lagaate hai or din main ausatan 60 chakra goliyaan chalaate hai-ke maamle main peeche nahin hai
 It is also a lucrative career in terms of earning
 unhen mul vetan kaa 25 pratishat “commando bhatte” ke rup main miltaa he
 Yet this force lacks state-of-the-art equipment and agile training
 1984 main sena kii karrwai main swarna mandir kii tabaahi ke baad enesji kaa gathan kiya gaya tha jisane gathan ke sirf chaar saal baad hi safal oparation karke duniya ko apni kshamta kaa parichay de diya tha
 In May 1988, 41 terrorists sitting inside the Golden Temple in Operation Black Thunder were gunned down by NSG shooters and not a single commando was killed in the encounter
 lekin kai varshon main dhire-dhire uski takneekee kshamta kamjor hoti gai
 This weakness of the NSG was evident during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai from Akshardham in 2002 to 2008 when they were taking on eight lashkar-e-taiba terrorists in two five-star hotels and a Jewish center in Mumbai
 commando javaanon ke aam motorola handseton kii bydaree hi khatm ho gai thi, unke paas apane bachaav ke liye helmet or belistic kavach jaise jaruri saamaan tak nahin the
 The instruments they had for viewing at night were also not effective
 badtar to yah ki cmanderon kaa apane javaanon se sampark tak tut gaya tha
 The 48-hour complex operation of the NSG in Mumbai exposed many flaws and forced it to peek inside
 26 / 11 hamalon main aatankwaadiyon kaa muqabla karne vaale ek anbhavi jawan ne grih mantri ko die gaye apane prajentation main kaha, “yah force katai vishisht nahin he
 It is simply a force
 ”mumbai hamalon ke baad ke kuch maheenon main enesji ne apni kshamta badhaane ke liye jaruraton kii suchi taiyaar kii thi
 India Today acquired a copy of that list, an August 2012 document of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which outlined a comprehensive framework for the NSG
 isamen 240 bade or chote upkarnon kii suchi di gai he, jinhen 1,400 karod ru
 To be achieved in five years
 grih mantralay ke dastavej main likhaa he, “enesji commando ke sabhi opareshnon main samay kaa khaas mahatv hota he, isliye har mausam main kaam karne kii kshamta or takneekee visheshta aprihaary he
 "it advocated" real-time sensor shoot grids, data compatibility and analysis, action-deciding centers as well as equipping the force with state-of-the-art equipment, weapons and communications capabilities "
 kisi saamaanya paryvekshak ke liye yah sirf khilaunon kii suchi bhar lagati, lekin enesji ke afasar ise un kshamtaaon ko hasil karnaa bataate hai jisase ve aatankwaadiyon par baari pad sakate hai
 All commandos will be well connected via GPS with wearable computers and body mounted cameras and satellite phones via voice and video links

 The drone and portable aerostat will keep him constantly informed of the fighting site
 vijan or thermal image fyujan camere unhen aadmi or jaanavar ke bich fark bataa sakenge
 The equipment to be replenished will force the Force's three weakened arms — the Electronic Support Group, the Technical Support Group, and the Special Weapons Squad
 kareeb do saal ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad upie sarkaar ne 1,400 karod ru
 The list of 200 items in the plan for modernization of NSG was approved at a cost of Rs
 paanch varshiya yojana main is force ko unnat radio, lambii duuri vaale sensoron, thermal image dene vaale upkarnon or portable radaron se las kiya jayega
 Eight years later, only a handful of items on the list — sniper rifles and submarines, and an armored truck — have been purchased
 enesji kii website ke mutabik, kam se kam 27 item-shot mashinagan, darwaja bhedane vaale grenade, semi-automatic sniper rifl, bandhak se baatcheet ke set, waal contact microphone, jinka istemaal kamaron main jasusi yaa jhaankne ke liye kiya jaataa he-abhi shuruaati request for infarmeshan (ref) charan main hai
 It will take at least five years for the NSG to get all the equipment at the current rate of acquiring the required items
 diene main gadabadienesji kii sabase badi chintaa yah he ki yah ek pratiniyukti par aadhaarit force he
 This means that it does not have its own permanent cadre
 sena ke karmi do saal kii pratiniyukti par enesji main aate hai or ardhsainik bal ke karmi paanch saal kii pratiniyukti par isamen kaam karte hai
 This temporary character of the Force has eroded its institutional memory
 enesji kii upeksha ke beej shaayad grih mantralay kii aadhunikeekaran kii apni yojana main hi nihit he
 In the document it is named "central Armed Police Force", a terminology that informs the death of a special force
 enesji kaa unnateekaran aam taur par kaagajon tak hi simit rahaa he, kyonki upree str par lagaataar badlaav hote rahe hai
 The Director General is the head of the provision and supply unit located at the NSG headquarters near Delhi Airport
 26 / 11 ke baad se enesji main chah mahanideshak badale ja chuke hai, prayek ausatan 14 maheene seva main rahaa he
 An NSG official says, "it only takes six months for someone to understand the process here
 or jab tak vah koi faisla karata he, uske jane kaa samay aa jaataa he
 Major General V
 ke
 Dutta (retd), who took part in Operation Black Thunder in 1988, says, "britain's SAS is also a deputation-based force, but 25 percent of the people are permanent
 bhartiya sena ke commando apane vishesh bataliyanon main 10 saal se zyada samay bitaate hai
 “NSG was to work in coordination with the Special Rangers Group (SRG)
 prayek main ardhsainik balon se liye gaye kareeb 1,000 commando vaale teen batalian hone the
 The SRG was supposed to build a siege around the siege, but was never available for the task, as nearly two-thirds of the SRG battalions have been deployed for VVIP protection
 pathankot main enesji ne haal ke varshon main pehali baar esarji kii ek batalian ko sakriy oparation main tainaat kiya
 Critics say that the Home Ministry's decision to spread the force to four metros - Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chennai after 26 / 11 - sounded its death knell
 10,000 se zyada karmiyon vaala enesji bhartiya sena ke parachute commando force se bhi bada he
 These new centers lack equipment such as ladder systems for aircraft entry, while they can be used to attack a hijacked aircraft
 sena ke vishesh balon ke afasar leptinent general prakaash chand katoch (ritred) kehete hai, “jis tarah enesji kaa kuch varshon main vistaar kiya gaya he, usee tarj par jab aap kisi bal kaa vistaar karte hai to aap maanavshakti kii training or upkaran ko halkaa kar dete hai
 He cites four global truths about special forces: Humans are more important than hardware
 gunvattta maatra se behatar hoti he
 Special forces cannot be prepared in large quantities and cannot be formed after emergency occasions
 aatankwaadiyon se mukaable ke liye france kii vishesh force jiign main sirf 650 jawan hai
 Germany's GSG-9, on whose model NSG is formed, has just 200 commandos
 ek aise daur main jab aatankwaadiyon se nipatane main police balon ke paas paryaapt kshamta nahin he, sangheey apatkaaleen force ke taur par gathit enesji ko lagaataar abhaavon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 It has not even started the process of acquiring helicopters
 vah apane javaanon ke prashikshan ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena or ro ke aviation research centre se inhen udhaar letaa he
 Former NSG DG Arvind Ranjan says that the lack of equipment is just a curtain, which hides even bigger issues than this
 ve kehete hai, “is force main sabase badi khami yah he ki iske paas adhikariyon kii taraf se koi drushti, javabdehi or jimmedaari nahin he
 Insiders say that the force has been slow in acquiring most of the equipment in its inventory
 total contanement wesel (tisivi), portable robot, helmet main lage nite vijan yantra jaise mahatvapurn upkaran abhi nahin mil paae hai, kyonki unke vaarshik rakrakhaav ke theke abhi nahin ho paae hai
 The NSG base at Manesar still lacks a modern firing range
 26 / 11 hamale ke baad 6 karod ru
 The cost of the device was never installed
 enesji kaa aadhunikeekaran ek vyapak pherbadal kaa hissaa tha, jise upie sarkaar ne shuru kiya tha
 The 2001 NDA-1 Group of Ministers (gom) report was drafted after the Kargil Review Committee
 jioem ne aantarik suraksha kii vyavastha main vyapak pherbadal kii sifarish kii thi
 But these reforms were initiated only after the 26 / 11 attack
 upie sarkaar apane kaarykaal ke antim dinon main grih mantralay ke sudhaaron kii disha se bhatak gai or yah bhatkaav endie ke shashan main bhi bana hua he
 The possibility of more attacks like Pathankot and Gurdaspur has now increased the chances that this force will be called for action soon
 aatankwaadi is vishesh bal ke apni kamajoriyaan dur karne kaa intjaar nahin karne vaale hai
 Obviously, in such an environment, if our governments do not warn, then big attacks are waiting for us
 isliye hamaare niti-nirmaataaon ko apane rajnatik hiton se upar uthakar deshhit or logon kii suraksha par dhyaan dena hoga, tabhi ham aashwast ho sakenge

 The opposition is accusing the government of making fun of the common man
 vahiin, vipaksh to vipaksh, khud sarkaar ke saathi bhi yojana ayog ke paimaane ko galat tehra rahe hai
 The attack has been initiated by BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar
 unhone kaha, 'upie sarkaar ne ek baar phir janata kaa majaak udaaya he
 By changing only one rupee in the daily expenditure, the government has denied crores of people with facilities
 'unhone kaha, 'chunaav se pehle yah sarkaar kii apane record thik karne kii koshish he
 We reject this report of the Planning Commission
 'prakaash jaavdekar ne congress ke netaaon ko chunauti di he ki ve maatr 34 rupee main dinabhar guzaara karke dikhaaen
 Significantly, according to the Planning Commission, people who spend 27 rupees 20 paise in rural areas and 33 rupees 33 paise in urban areas everyday will not be considered below the poverty line

 He said, there has been a reduction in poverty, but the figures of the Planning Commission are completely wrong
 yojana ayog ko naseehat dete hue unhone kaha, 'ayog ko khaane or rahan-sahan ke hisaab se nai seemaa honi chahie
 According to the latest figures of the Planning Commission on poverty, there has been a reduction of 15% in poverty in 2011-12 as compared to 2004-05
 2011-12 main garibi 21
 9 percent was recorded while in 2004-05 this figure was 37

 The Planning Commission says that in 2011-12, poverty was calculated according to the Tendulkar system and if this system is to be believed, then the people earning more than Rs 816 in the village and Rs 1000 in the cities have risen above the poverty line

 According to this report, the decision of demonetisation was wrong and this led to a loss of 1 percent of the country's GDP
 gauratlab he ki vitt maamalon kii yah sansadeey samiti congress netaa virappa moili ke netritv main gathit he or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh is samiti main bataur sadsy shaamil hai
 But effectively the ruling BJP dominates this committee

 In his statement, Dubey claimed that the BJP did not agree that demonetisation was a wrong decision
 vahiin doobe ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki notebandi ek safal kadam tha or isse kaledhan ko khatm karne or digital pement ko badhaava dene main madad mili thi
 According to sources, Veerappa Moily, the chairman of the committee, had spoken to the BJP members on the issue so that the report prepared on the note ban decision could be debated and a motion could be brought
 lekin 31 sadasyon vaali is samiti main bijepi ke 17 saansad sadsy maujuud hai is sankhya ke aadhaar par report ko bahes ke liye samiti ke saamne nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 It is to be noted that if the chairman of the committee had chosen the way of voting on this report, then two reports would have been reached before the committee and the second report would have made the opposite conclusion on demonetisation

 The Delhi government may be patting its back on the budget, but the Congress has made a scathing attack on this budget
 congress sarkaar main mantri rahe sabhi netaaon ne aap sarkaar ke bajet ko janata se kiya gaya chhalaava bataaya he
 Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken said that the budget of Delhi is a complete sham
 pichley baar ke bajet kaa 30% abhi bhi kharch nahin hua he
 He said that every year the budget is given a new name, sometimes Swaraj Budget, sometimes aud-even Budget, sometimes Outcome Budget and this time it has been called Green Budget, but this government only keeps the name

 Meanwhile Digvijay Singh is worshiped with computer Baba
 news agency eenai ke mutabik digvijay singh us jagah par puja karne baithe jahaan par commuter baba hajaaron saadhuon ke saath digvijay singh ke liye hathyog karenge
 Let us tell you that in Madhya Pradesh, Computer Baba was given the status of a minister in Shivraj Singh Chauhan's government, but later came out of the government due to estrangement
 aisa lag rahaa he ki pragna thakur ke ugr hindutv kaa saamana karne ke liye digvijay singh ko hathyog kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 However, some statements by Pragya Thakur have put BJP in a very uncomfortable position and party leaders have explained to Pragya Thakur what to say and what not to say
 vahiin pragna thakur ko chunaav ayog kii ore se 72 ghante ke pratibandh kaa saamana karnaa padaa he vahiin bain ke baad bhi chunaav prachaar karne kii shikaay par ek or notice bhi jari ho gaya he

 Singh is giving the road map of the development of Bhopal and details of the work done during his tenure

 ve vastav main raajnneeti ke sant hai
 "according to experts, the possibility of polarization in the election of Bhopal cannot be ruled out
 congress kii har sambhav koshish hogi ki dhruvikaran ko kisi tarah roka jaae, digvijay singh swayan dharmik sthalon par jaakar apni chhavi banane main lage hai to duusari taraf bhaajapa digvijay singh ko muslim parast or hindu virdohi bataane main lag gai he
 At the same time, Pragya is being presented as a persecuted Hindu woman by the Congress

 The 45th match of the IPL Season 12 between Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will be played at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur from 8 pm today (saturday)
 donon hi timen is mukaable main apane ahm videshi khilaadiyon ke bina hi ek-duusare ke khilaaf maidan main utregi
 Currently, the Rajasthan Royals are looking stronger than Sunrisers Hyderabad as they do not have Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler who have left for England to join the World Cup camp
 iske alaava jofara archer bhi rajasthan royles team kaa hissaa nahin rahenge
 Sunrisers Hyderabad will surely miss their explosive opener and the services of England's Johnny Bairstow who teamed up with David Warner to form a strong opening pair
 donon tiimon ke liye chijen kathin ho jaaengi jab australian khilaadi warner or royles ke captain steve smith agle hafte swadesh ravaanaa ho jaaenge
 In the points table, Hyderabad's team is better placed by winning five out of 10 matches while Rajasthan has won only four out of 11 matches
 lekin ye bhi plaof sthaan kii daud main bani hui hai
 All-rounder Archer gave Rajasthan a thrilling win over KKR on Thursday and they will be missing a lot
 england ke teenon khilaadiyon ke jane se rajasthan ko kaaphi kami khalegi, lekin ajinkya rahane or smith kii form uske liye sakaaratmak sanket he
 Hyderabad's team will be greatly affected by the absence of foreign players, but they will have to be a little smart in replacing the players in their place
 warner 29 april ko satr kaa apana antim match kings ilevan punjab ke khilaaf khelenge, unki jagah martin gaptil le sakate hai
 The search for Rajasthan Royals Rajasthan this time has been Assam's 17-year-old player Ryan Parag, who has shown great talent with bat and ball
 usne keker ke khilaaf 31 gend main 47 ran banaae or rajasthan ko mushkil sthiti se jeet kii ore pahunchaa diya
 Sanju Samson is also in good form and Rahul Tripathi also hit a half-century in place of the opener
 eshton turnar or liyaan livingstone khud ko sabit nahin kar sake hai or inhen apane khel main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 Bowling will be the biggest concern for the hosts as Archer was the most effective bowler in the death overs
 haalanki varuna aaron bhi keker ke khilaaf prabhavi dikhe jinhone 20 ran dekar do wicket chatkaaye or main aaf da match puraskaar ne unke aatmavishvaas ko badhaayaa
 Oshane Thomas also performed well

 Pakistan has finally accepted that Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist caught alive in the terrorist attack on Mumbai, is a Pakistani citizen
 haalanki isko lekar pakistan kii ore se dohare bayaan aa rahe hai
 On the one hand, he believes that Kasab is his citizen, while on the other hand he is denying it
 ab pakistan videsh mantralay ne phir kabool kiya he ki kasaab pakistan kaa hi naagarik he
 Pakistan's information minister Sherry Rehman has confirmed this
 rahamaan ne aaj tak ko esemes ke jariye is bare main suchit kiya he
 Earlier on Wednesday, there were reports in the Pakistani media that in the initial investigation of the Pakistan government, Kasab was revealed to be a Pakistani citizen
 uske kuch der baad hi pakistan isse mukar gaya
 Pakistan Foreign Ministry Spokesman Muhammad Sadiq had said that such reports are coming in the media due to confusion and it is too early to say anything
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki kasaab ke bare main abhi jaanch jari he
 Pakistan's Geo TV and Dawn News reported quoting government sources that Pakistan has accepted that Kasab is from the same place
 pakistan is maamle main baari antarrashtriya dabaav jhel rahaa he or roj nae nae bayaan de rahaa he
 But now that the Pakistani government has accepted Kasab as being a Pakistani citizen, it can be considered a major diplomatic success of India
 isse pehle kasaab ke pita or uske gaanv vaale bhi use pahchaan chuke hai

 He submitted his resignation to Lok Sabha Secretary General TK Vishwanathan
 haalanki party chaar kendriya mantriyon ko istife jaisaa kadam uthaane se rokane main manaane main safal rahi he
 Human Resource Development Minister Pallam Raju is among the ministers who offered to resign but has been asked to continue in the post

 Law Minister Salman Khurshidam, who has faced the sharp attacks of Kejriwal, feels that an 'ant' cannot be a challenge for an elephant like Congress
 khurshid ne kaha ki kejariwal apane aaropon ke jariye bade dalon ko nasht kar unka sthaan grahan karne kaa sapana paale hue hai jo kabhi puraa nahin hoga
 The minister said that Kejriwal himself is facing allegations like his NGO receiving donations from abroad, he should answer these questions instead of throwing mud on others
 kejariwal ne salmaan khurshid evam unke parivaar dwaara sanchalit enjio main kathith vittiya aniyamitata kaa aarope lagaate hue nishaanaa banaaya he
 Khurshid denied the allegations in an interview stating that he had threatened Kejriwal on his proposed visit to Farrukhabad
 abhi or khulaase karuungah arvind kejarivalunhone kaha, ‘main kejariwal ko kyon dhamkee duungaa? kis liye dhamkee duungaa? isse mujhe kya hasil hoga? aap kya samajhate hai ki unka kad, str or vyaktitv aisa he ki main unpar dhyaan duungaa
 'khurshid said,' He (kejriwal) is quite young
 itane chote hai ki hamaari party se sangharsh kar sake
 An ant cannot kill an elephant
 hathi kii sound main saikadon kii sankhya main ghusane par bhi cheentee use koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa sakati
 "when asked whether he believes that the corruption dispute involving political parties like Congress and BJP will benefit newcomers to enter politics," the law minister said, "it is only a dream
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘kuch log aisa sapana paale hue hai ki ve avyavhaarik or betuke hamalon se sabhi chizon or vashare kaa itihaas rakhane vaale raajnneetik dalon ko nasht kar sakate he
 Those legs believe that this will eliminate these parties and clear the way for them
 ’salmaan khurshid ne di arvind kejariwal ko khuli dhamkikhurshid ne kaha, ‘main samajhataa hum ki is tarah se ‘sabhi ko samaapt karne’, aise sabhi chizon ko jala dene kaa aacharan or aisa samajhnaa ki is raakh par naye bharat kaa nirmaan hoga or is naye bharat main aise chote samoohon or dalon ko satta main aane kaa mauka milegaa
 Thinking like this is only his dream
 ’kejariwal ke enjio ko videshi chanda milane ke bare main congress netaa digvijay singh ke aaropon kii pushti karne se bachate hue vidhi mantri ne kaha ki in sabhi prashnon kaa uttar diya janaa chahie or singh ne kaaphi sankhya main acchhee saamagree ekatra kii he
 Khurshid said, 'it is strange that they ask questions to anyone and expect answers but do not answer the questions asked of them
 kejariwal ko inkaa uttar dena chahie
 i answered it within three hours of coming to India
 ’ vidhi mantri ne haryana main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad rabart wadra se jude bhoomi saudon main aniyamita ke aaropon ko bhi sire se khaarij kar diya
 He said, 'there is nothing wrong in this that we need to hide
 yah galat baat he ki aap kisi nijee kaarobaari ke maamalon main dakhal den or kahen ki vah kisi se judaa hua he
 Khurshid said that he knows that this attack is not against any private businessman but against his leadership
 vidhi mantri ne un baton ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki wadra se jude bhoomi saudon se party kii chhavi dhoomil hui he
 The Law Minister said, 'someone says the wrong things about you because he expects some people to accept his words and if some people believe these things then it will be sad and tragic
 lekin mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki aisa kuch bhi nahin hoga
 Referring to the distorted statement about Kejriwal's move to Farrukhabad, Khurshid said, "if you think that no news can be made without being manipulated, then i would say that Present the whole thing and let people decide
 ’jaane salmaan khurshid kii shakhsiyat ko
 
 
 Khurshid said that about Kejriwal going to Farrukhabad, he said that Kejriwal should go there and return after getting a response to his allegations
 unhone kaha ki jab unhone kaha ki vah apane khun kaa istemaal karenge, unka aashay tha ki vah apane khun kaa upyog apni kahani likhane ke liye karenge
 Khurshid said, 'I will not use any other person's blood in my pen
 main hinsa or nuksaan pahunchane ke bare main kuch nahin kahata
 i don't say anything about looking down on a person
 tab main dhamkee kaise de saktaa hum
 Asked how an enlightened and gentle politician can use offensive language against Kejriwal, the Law Minister said, "I am not a machine
" main ek manushya hum
 "after all, who is Arvind Kejriwal? He said that when he was abroad, the protesters on the streets were making statements that" i should be arrested
 " meri patni ko giraftaar kiya jaae
 Asked if he had any bitterness or resentment, Khurshid said, 'sometimes it looks like bitterness, sometimes resentment
 kabhi yah dukhad hota he
 Sometimes i think it is a matter of concern
 keval apane bare main hi chintaa nahin balki us santhaan ke bare main jiskaa main pratinidhitiv karata hum
 If i cannot defend it as Law Minister then how will i defend my party and government
 ’ yah puche jane par ki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki vah enjio se jude visisth sawaalon kaa uttar nahin de sake, unhone kaha, ‘kaise aarope? saboot kahaan he?’khurshid ne kaha ki mul mudda yah he ki kya shiviron kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha yaa nahin
 He said that devices such as hearing aids, three-wheelers can be given to those who need it
 teen logon ne kaha ki unka upkaran duusare log le gayi
 The Law Minister started investigating against Khurshid's trust, saying, 'I am confident that i will come out of it
 agar main adaalat main sabit kar duun ki shiviron kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha or adaalat mujhe paisa detii he, kya meraa jivan pehle jaisaa saamaanya ho paayegaa
 Khurshid deferred to questions in which he was asked whether as a law minister he had evidence about alleged irregularities involving the children of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior BJP leader LK Advani as claimed by Digvijay
 Singh has done
 nitin gadakari par kejariwal ke hamale ke bare main unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ne jo kuch kaha he, usase aage vah kuch nahin kahana chahate hai
 He said, 'I would like to say that please pay attention to what you did in the last few months
