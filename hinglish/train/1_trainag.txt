 ab main is film ke bare main kahana chaahunga ki jayadeep chopra, jo film ke nirmaataa bhi hai, ne ek eemaandaar kahani ko eemaandaar tareeke se kehane kii koshish kii he
 
 
 As a director, he could also make his debut film a masala film, but he chose a story that conveys entertainment as well as a message
 
 
 tippaniyan Mona Vasu's acting is good
 
 
 sumit nizaavan kii acting se zyada lekhak ke taur par unki tarif karnaa chaahunga
 
 
 He needs to work on himself as an actor right now, but his good thing is that he does not do over-acting anywhere in the entire film
 
 
 pankaj treepathi, zakir hossain, jishaan or maanav kowshik bhi apane abhinay se chhap chhodte hai
 
 
 The script of the film is good, but the item songs and songs could have been avoided, as they slow down the pace of the film
 
 
 film kii kahani aapako baandhe rakhti he or kahani ke kai mode aapako chaunkaa dete hai
 
 
 Jaideep as the director and Sumit in the lead role should have worked a bit more on the graph of his character

 i have a rating of 'mazi' - 3 stars

 Pankaj Tripathi, Zakir Hussain, Zeeshan and Manav Kaushik also make a mark with their acting
 
 
 film kii script acchhee he, lekin item song or gaanon se bachaa ja saktaa tha, kyonki ye film kii gati ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 
 
 The story of the film keeps you hooked and the many twists of the story startle you
 
 
 nirdeshak ke rup main jayadeep or mukhya bhoomika main sumit ko apane kirdaar ke graph par thodaa or kaam karnaa chahie tha
 
 
 Overall 'mazi' is an entertaining thriller, which also gives a good message

 diu ke mashhoor saint steffens college main admician ke liye har baar kii tarah is baar bhi jabardast pratispardhaa he kyonki jari kii gai college kii cat of suchi ke tahat zyaadaatar paathyakramon main daakhile ke liye 95 pratishat se adhik ank hone chahie
 The marks of students who passed the 12th examination from the subject of commerce for appearing in the interview for admission to the college's most demanding economics course were 98 percent while 96 students of science and humanities respectively
 75 or 96
 Should be 5 percent
 isamen ganit main 85 fisadi ank kii shart bhi judi hui he
 The cut-off for SC and ST category students is 93 and 91 respectively
 5 pratishat he
 This year, 6,469 students applied for economics
 is saal doosraa sarvaadhik lokapriy paathyakram angreji he
 Its cut off is also like economics
 vahiin, sanskrit ekmaatr aisa paathyakram he jisamen cat of sabhi shreniyon ke ummidavaaron ke liye mahaj 65 pratishat he
 Around 25,636 students applied for 450 college seats
 kendriya madhyamik shiksha board kii 10veen pariksha ke nattejey jari kar die gaye hai or is baar rigelt 8 saal puraane pattern se jari hue hai, jisamen parikshaarthiyon ke number bhi jari kiye gaye hai
 The difference between the mental state of the candidates and the percentage near the results is also visible
 rigelt aane ke kuch hi ghanton baad 3 vidhyaarthiyon ne rigelt acha naa rahane kii vajah se khud ko maut ke hawaale kar diya
 Also, this time the result of 10th has also been less than previous years
 8 saal baad lagu hua marks patternaparikshaarthiyon kaa rigelt ummid ke anusaar naa aane or paas pratishat main kami hone ke peeche pariksha pattern main badlaav bhi ek ahm vajah ho sakati he
 Explain that after 8 years, the board has implemented the old system again, according to which the number and marks percentage of the candidates are given, while from 8 years the results were released through CGPA in CBSE 10th standard
 miliye un chaar honhaaron se, jinhone CBSE 10veen main kiya karnamastudents kaa bhi maananaa he ki pattern main hue badlaav se tanaav zyada rahata he or isse marks pataa chalane kaa dar bana rahata he
 At the same time, competition in CGPA system is less and competition among students is decided on the basis of each mark
 haal hi main 10veen kii pariksha main bhaag lene vaale deepies student abhinav chaturvedi kaa kahana he, 'marks pattern main hua badlaav aapasi compitishan ko janm detaa he or toppers ke naam jari hone se bhi bachche khud ko kam aankane lagate hai, jo tanaav kaa kaaran he
 'abhinav told,' Earlier when CGPA based result used to come, there was not much competition in the Friend Circle, but now there is increasing tension about number in one class only
 'vahiin bhupesh gupta kaa kahana he, 'jab mere bade bhai ne sijipie pattern se 10veen pariksha paas kii thi to unako rigelt kii itani tension nahin thi, lekin jab maine is pattern se pariksha di he to mere saath puraa parivaar tension main tha
 At the same time, there remains social pressure on the children whether their numbers have come or they have come less than me
 ' bhupesh ke anusaar sijipie pattern thik tha, kyonki usamen kam ank hasil karne vaale ummidavaar zyada pareshaan nahin rahete the
 Prakhar tops in CBSE 10th, said- EXAM did not take tension; Pass percentage decreased
 After 8 years, this pattern has also led to a drop in pass percentage
 is saal pichley 5 saalon main sabase kam fisadi bachche paas hue hai
 If you look at the figures of last year, 98 in 2014
 87 fisadi, 2015 main 97
 32 percent, 96 in 2016
 21 fisadi, 2017 main 90
 95 percent of the children had passed, while 86 this time
 70 bacchon ne safalataa hasil kii he
 How was the result, in which 25 students have made a place in the first 3 places
 pehle sthaan par 499 ank ke saath chaar parikshaarthi hai, jabaki duusare sthaan par 498 ank ke saath 7 or tisare sthaan par 497 ank ke saath 11 chaatro ne jagah banaai he
 On the other hand, many candidates are disappointed, including the candidate who failed and scored less than expected
 ye hai rigelt ke aankdeis saal pariksha main 86
 7% of children have passed
 vahiin ladakiyon ne ladakon se acha pradarshan kiya he
 Girls pass percentage of 88
 67 fisadi rahaa or 85
 Only 32 per cent boys have passed
 is pariksha main 16,24,682 vidhyaarthiyon ne hissaa liya tha, jisamen 14,08,594 fisadi parikshaarthi paas hue hai
 99 in Thiruvananthapuram
 60 fisadi, chennai main 97
 37 per cent and 91 in Ajmer region
 83 fisadi bachche paas hue hai
 This year 1,31,493 children scored more than 90 per cent, while 27,476 per cent children scored more than 95 per cent

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Mudgal committee to investigate the alleged spot-fixing and betting case in the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to decide the punishment of the accused under the rules of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
 bisisiai kii ore se upasthit varisht vakil sie sundaram ne nyaayalay ke faisle par sahmati vyakt kii he
 Earlier, Sundaram has asked the court to set up an external commission to decide the sentence so that the verdict can be transparent
 nyaayamurti ties thakur or nyaayamurti fakir mohammad ibrahim kalipholla kii peeth ne kaha, "mudgal samiti se hi is par karrwai karne or is maamle ke tarksangat suzav ke bare main poocha jaae
 They should also be given the right to impose fines
 " The court said, "now that the report has come, we can ask the BCCI to take a decision within 10 days
 " Sundaram told the court, "let the BCCI be given an opportunity to hear before him
 " On this, the court said that the Mudgal Committee report has been received by the court and the hearing phase is over
 nyaayalay ne kaha, "aakhir aap log karrwai kyon nahin kar rahe? ham karrwai kyon karen? ham sirf kii gai karrwai kii sangatta kii jaanch karenge
 We will give you an opportunity to appeal to that
 " The court said that if the court takes action on the report of the Mudgal Committee, it would be a violation of the bcci's rights
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha ki nyaayalay mudgal samiti kii report par bisisiai ke maujuuda adhikariyon evam anya logon dwaara mayppan ke khilaaf dandatmak karrwai kaa nirdhaaran kiye jane ke khilaaf he
 The court said that the powers of the current BCCI committee have expired, as its tenure has ended long back
 nyaayalay ne kaha, "maamle main sanlipt sabhi logon ko isse dur rakhaa jaae
 There should be fresh elections in BCCI and completely new faces should be brought in BCCI which can take action on the report of Mudgal Committee
 " This decision of the court has given a big blow to Srinivasan's chances of standing for the election of BCCI President for the fourth term
 sundaram ne is par nyaayalay se kaha, "nyaayalay hi koi bahya ayog nirdhaarit kare or maamle par nirnay le taaki faisle par kisi ko aapatti na ho
 " nyaayalay ke maamle main sanlipt sabhi logon ko baahar rakhe jane ke faisle kaa samarthan karte hue yachikakarta bihar cricket sangh kii ore se upasthit vakil nalini chidambaram ne kaha ki shrinivas ko bisisiai se baahar rakhaa jaae
 Chidambaram said, "in principle, Srinivasan should not stand in the next BCCI election
 " Chidambaram said that from a larger perspective like truth, honesty and public policy, Srinivasan also falls under the purview of the bcci's anti-corruption Operating Rules for not taking any action despite having knowledge of betting
 chidambaram kii daleel par shrinivasana kii ore se upasthiti kapil sibbal ne nyaayalay se kaha, "iskaa koi or makasad nahin balki sirf shrinivasana ko chunaav se dur rakhana he

 saiyad shuja naam ke is kathith haikar ne haalanki bijepi ke alaava anya kai partiyon par aarope lagaae or kaha ki sapa, basapa jaisi partiyaan bhi isamen shaamil rahi hai
 The Election Commission of India (EC) strongly denied Shuja's claim and said that India's evms are absolutely safe
 ayog ne kaha he ki shuja ke aaropon kii chaanbin kii ja rahi he or unpar kanoonee karrwai par bhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 This is not the first time that India's electronic voting machine was blamed
 haalanki desh se baahar yah pehla mauka jarur tha jab baqayada press conference kar yah bataaya gaya ki iviem tempring aasaan he or pehle hota rahaa he
 This incident on foreign soil created further controversy when senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Kapil Sibal was present in that press conference
 bijepi ne ise sajeesh qaraar diya or kaha ki congress apane 'freelansar' hameshaa taiyaar rakhti he, yahaan tak ki pakistan main bhi modi sarkaar ke khilaaf log bheje jate hai
 Union minister and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi even said at the press conference held in London that Kapil Sibal's presence was sent by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi
 beete din kaa vakya kai kadiyon main ek nai kadi rahi jab nirvachan ayog ko ek baar phir 'sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa lekin EC hameshaa se daawa karata aayaa he ki iviem phulpruf he or isaki suraksha main koi sendhamari nahin kar saktaa
 The Commission has also challenged that someone should come forward and show the EVM by tampering
 ek-do maukey aae jab netaaon or partiyon ne iviem ko 'kathghare' main khadaa kiya lekin nateeja shunya rahaa
 Let us know how many times the questions were raised on evms and how evms answered all these questions
 
 
 adwani kaa sawaal or bijepi kii jeetlalkrishna adwani desh ke namchin netaaon main ek hai or bijepi ke agrani purodhaon main unka naam he
 In 2009, one of his statements created a ruckus that till the Election Commission fully guarantees the safety of evms, elections should be conducted in the country only through ballot paper
 unhone maharashtra or teen anya pradeshon main ballat paper se matdaan karaae jane kii maang kii
 This was the first time a senior leader of a party made an open statement against evms
 us vakt adwani loksabhaa main netaa pratipaksh the
 The Congress was in government, so its reasoning was as logic as the BJP gives today
 congress ne adwani ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya or iviem se chunaav karaae jane par hami bhari
 Even after Advani's allegations, EVM managed its examination and the 2014 election was conducted in a fair manner
 maje kii baat yah he ki 2009 ke aaropon ke baad 2014 main bijepi ghanghor bahumat se satta main ai or itihaas main record darj ho gaya
 After that the BJP brushed off this charge and today the condition is that the Congress is encircling the BJP on the same things that Advani had made at that time
 baharhaal, bijepi-congress kii is tutu-manmain main iviem majbootee se khadi rahi or aaj bhi logon kaa bharosa is par kaayam he
 Madhya Pradesh elections and Congress: Madhya Pradesh assembly elections were held recently and Congress won
 matdaan sampann hone ke baad pradesh ke varisht congress netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki jis strong room main iviem mashine rakhi gayi vahaan achaanak bijli gai
 So it can be a case of tampering from evms
 ghatana bhopal jail kii he
 The Collector of Bhopal stated in his report that on 30 November, there was a power outage from 8:30 AM to 9:30 PM and during this time CCTV recording was not recorded
 haalanki tempring ke is aarope par chunaav ayog aage aayaa or usne vaikalpik vyavastha kii sari jaankaree di
 Voting took place and the result came in favor of Congress
 dilachasp baat yah he ki congress kii jeet ke baad iviem main chhedchhad ke aarope kahin gum ho gaye or ab kahin sunne main bhi nahin aate
 The AAP also took almost two years after the EVM assembly elections were held in testup
 us chunaav main bijepi jabardast siton se jiti or lagbhag sabhi partiyon kuch siton par sint gayi
 Its most sharpened on evms and the Aam Aadmi Party was at the forefront
 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne ise vyaktigat ladaai mana or ayog ke khilaaf maidan main utar gaye
 Kejriwal's allegation was also because his party had lost badly in Punjab and Goa
 kejariwal ne chunaav ayog ke khilaaf kaaphi tikhi tippanee kii or use bijepi kaa agent qaraar diya
 He said that the commission works for the BJP
 haalanki in aaropon par ayog ne sirf itnaa hi kaha ki iviem phulpruf he or chunaav ayog apana kaam eemaandaaree se karata he
 Interestingly, Saurabh Bhardwaj, an MLA from Kejriwal, was openly announcing and giving demos of how to hack evms
 haalanki ayog ne yah chalange sweekaara or un partiyon ko aamantrit kiya jinhone hack karne kaa daawa kiya tha
 The result was that neither party accepted the commission's invitation
 dilli sthit pakistan ucchayog ke baahar se ek vyakti ko hiraasat main liya gaya he, jahaan shuukravaar ko pakistan kaa rashtriya diwas manaaya ja rahaa he
 It is being told that the person was trying to go inside

 Several separatist leaders from Jammu and Kashmir were specially invited to the National Day celebrations by the Delhi-based Pakistani High Commission
 haalanki, bhartiya videsh mantralay ne pakistan ke rashtriya diwas samaaroh main aadhikarik pratinidhi nahin bhejne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The Indian High Commissioner gave this information in a press conference
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki bharat ne aaj pakistan rashtriya diwas samaaroh main bhaag lene ke liye koi pratinidhi nahin bhejne kaa faisla kiya he
 He said that no Indian representative would participate in such programs organized in Islamabad
 videsh mantralay ne yah faisla pakistan ucchayog dwaara kashmiri algaavvaadi netaaon ko bhi aamantrit kiye jane ke kaaran liya
 Over the years, India's representation in such programs has been of Union Ministerial status
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha, ‘bharat ne aaj hone vaale pakistan rashtriya diwas samarohon main kisi bhi pratinidhi ko nahin bhejne kaa faisla kiya he
 The Pakistan High Commission decided to invite Hurriyat Conference representatives to the ceremony and India decided after that
 ’kumaar ne media brifing main kaha ki bharat kaa spasht ruukh he ki pakistani ucchayog yaa pakistani netritv dwaara hurriyat conference ke saath baatcheet ke kisi bhi prayaas ko halke main nahin liya jayega
 India has been strongly opposed to Pakistan's talks with separatist leaders of Jammu and Kashmir
 kumaar ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘islamabad main hamaara ucchayog bhi vahaan ke samaaroh main shaamil nahin hoga
 'actually, calling the Hurriyat leaders for their national day on behalf of Pakistan indicates that Pakistan is still trying to interfere in India's internal affairs
 aise main bharat ne pakistan ke rashtriya diwas ke is aayojan main apane kisi bhi aadhikarik pratinidhi ko nahin bhejne kaa faisla kar ek baar phir pakistan ke samaksh ishaare-ishaare main apana rukh spasht kar diya he
 According to the information, India had informed the Pakistan High Commission last week that if Hurriyat leaders are invited by Pakistan, it will not send any of its representatives to the ceremony
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki bharat hurriyat netaaon ko nimantran dene ke kaaran kaaryakramon kaa bahishkaar kar rahaa he, na ki kisi anya kaaran se
 Let us know that in 2018, this ceremony of Pakistan was attended by Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
 yah nahin, is kaarykram main kashmir ke kai algaavvaadi netaa bhi shaamil hue the
 Let us know that Pakistan Day is celebrated on 23 March every year on the occasion of Lahore proposal
 lekin is varsh dilli sthit pakistan ucchayog ne ise ek din pehle yani 22 march ko manaane kaa faisla kiya he
 The decision has been taken by India at a time when tensions between the two neighboring countries are at their peak after India's airstrikes on jaish-e-mohammed's training camp in Balakot, Pakistan on 26 February following the Pulwama attack

 test main captaini kii ahmiyat takanic se zyada maansik hoti he or anderson-broard kii jodi cook ko jeet dilaane main kaamyaab rahati, lekin vanade main cook bataur captain or bataur ballebaaj fail hote najar aae
 In 22 innings, Cook was able to score only a half-century, which tells the story of his struggle
 itnaa hi nahin pichhali chah vanade siries main england paanch main haara he
 During this time, Cook continued the innings and failed, but he could not show any courage to captain and remove him from the team
 yahaan tak kii jab vishwacap ke liye 30 khilaadiyon kaa chayan hua, to team england kii captain cook ko hi di gai
 But even in the best conditions for batting in the seven ODI series against Sri Lanka, Cook's bat was craving for runs and England lost the series 5–2
 chayankartaaon kaa sabar kaa baandh tut gaya or der se hi sahi cook ko team se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Just before the World Cup, England's decision may surprise many, but it is a right decision
 isse england ko do phaayde honge
 Alex Hales will start the team's innings in odis and under the leadership of Morgan, the team will take the field with renewed vigor
 vahiin cook ko bhi maayoos honi kii jarurat nahin he ou yah maan lenaa chahie ki har koi har formatt main hit nahin hota
 He is the best player of the Test and in white clothes he will now have to find different colors of the game

 But within eight months of the second marriage, they started having estrangement and now both have been living apart from each other for almost a year
 pehle bhadakaau bhaashan or uske baad dhamkee
 The latest news is that Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj Thackeray has challenged the Maharashtra Government's order of inquiry related to the toll tax case, threatening that whatever the state government does against them, they will do whatever they wish
 kuch din pehle hi raaj thakare ne navi mumbai main bhadakaau bhaashan diya tha or apane kaaryakartaaon se apil kii thi ki ab toll naakon par toll tex dena band karen
 Since then, MNS activists have vandalized several toll points in Maharashtra
 iske baad rajya sarkaar ne raaj thakare ke bhaashan kii jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 But again Raj Thackeray is saying that whatever the government does, they will continue to do what they want
 raaj thakare ke khilaaf maamla darjmanase kaaryakartaaon dwaara puure rajya main vibhinn toll plaza main kii gai todphod ke baad party pramukh raaj thakare ke khilaaf kathith rup se hinsa bhadakaane or shanti ko khatre main daalane kaa maamla mangalvaar ko darj kiya gaya
 Raj Thackeray had issued a decree to his supporters on Monday not to pay toll tax and to beat up those who raised voice against this decree
 is bayaan ke baad maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke kaaryakartaaon ne rajya main kai pathakar boothon par todphod kii thi
 a case has been registered against Thackeray at Rajgarh police station of Bhor taluka for damaging toll plaza on Monday night at khed-shivpur on pune-satara road
 notebandi ko ek saal se zyada vakt ho gaya lekin bade cash mafia ab bhi raddi ho chuke 500 or 1000 ke noton ko thikaane lagane kii firaaq main hai
 Nowhere else is that right under the central government's nose, that is, in Delhi, the capital of the country
 india today kii special investigation team kii jaanch se ye gorakhdhandha benakaab hua he
 Let us know that just one day before the completion of one year of demonetisation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) seized illegal contracts worth Rs 36 crore in Delhi
 shaq he ki inkaa istemaal bharat virdohi gatividhiyon kii funding ke liye kiya janaa tha
 In this connection, 9 people were arrested
 india today ke under cover reporters ne apni jaanch se pataa lagaaya ki bade cash mafia ab bhi avaidh noton ko vaid noton main tabdeel karne ke gaiyr-kanoonee dhandhe main sakriy ho sakate hai
 During this investigation, some suspected agents were caught in hidden cameras who were willing to take 12 to 25 per cent of their real value for illegal currency
 yani agar ek lakh rupee ke 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane band ho chuke note die jaaen to uske badale 12 se 25 hajaar rupee ke nae vaid note mil jaaenge
 Clearly, this claim cannot be made without any connivance with some bank employees
 dakshin-pashchim dilli ke sarita vihaar main cash vaahak shivanand ko under cover reporter ne chhipecameremen ye daawa karte hue kaid kiya ki wo 200 karod rupee tak ke band kiye ja chuke noton ko vaid noton main tabdeel kara saktaa he
 Shivanand also offered pick up and delivery service
 shivanand ne under cover reporter se kaha ki ek haath se do or duusare haath se le lo
 It will be lifted from your place
 shivanand ne kaha ki hamaara vyakti aapke ghar par jaakar paisa (band ho chuki karency) check karegaa
 After this he will call and a van will arrive there
 ye 'haath se haath' vaala transction hoga
 When asked for the price of the exchange, Shivanand said that the rate is illegal according to what the illegal currency is
 agar 25 karod rupye kii avaidh karency badalani he to uske asal mulya ke 25 fisadi ke barabaravaidh notemilenge
 If an illegal currency of Rs 5 crore is to be converted, then 12 percent valid notes will be found in its place
 5 karod ke liye lagbhag 12-13 fisadi or 25 (karod) ke liye 25 fisadi
 Under the India Today investigation, two members of the Shivanand gang then reached Sohail and Faheem
 inhen madhya dilli ke kisaan ghat par chhipe camere main kaid kiya gaya
 Both of them insisted that no other bank official would do the work of checking, taking and converting the invalid currency
 fahim ne under cover reporter se kaha ki dekhie hamaara aadmi bank se aayega
 He will prove his identity
 ham baad main apni khep ke saath aaenge
 He (bank officer) will check your cash
 india today ke under cover reporter ne phir sandigdh adhikari tak pahunchane ke liye uske kaarysthal kaa rukh kiya
 This place was a branch of a top public sector bank in Okhla area of delhi
 vahaan sanjay naam ke staff ne naa sirf karency kii adlabadali ke liye deal kii balki usne ye khulaasa bhi kiya ki dilli main bada cash mafia kaale dhan ke jamaakhoron se avaidh karency ikattha kar rahaa he
 Sanjay was imprisoned in a hidden camera saying that he operates from a shop
 wo band ho chuki puraani karency ko ikattha karte hai
 They have set a target for big pickups
 sanjay ne apni desk se hi kaha, abhi haal main shivanand ne ek doctor se 2

 ' Lalit Modi, surrounded by controversies, may be asked to voluntarily step down at the Indian Premier League's governing council meeting on 26 April to decide his future as IPL commissioner and chairman

 BCCI President Shashank Manohar held a meeting with former board chief Sharad Pawar and informed him about the views of other members of the Governing Council
 modi ko pavaar kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 a top BCCI source indicated that Modi may be asked to step down at the Governing Council meeting in Mumbai and Pawar has also given his consent for the move
 sutara ne kaha, ‘yah ipel or bisisiai ke hit main he ki vah apane pad se istipha de den
 But if he does not do so, the Governing Council may be forced to pass a motion against him to remove him
 ’ sutara ne kaha, ‘board main is baat par lagbhag sarvasammati ban gai he ki modi ko janaa hoga
 They have no choice
 yah keval taarkik nishkarsh he
 Top officials of the BCCI believe that Modi's position has become untenable with many allegations and the process of 'cleanliness' can begin only after he is removed
 board ke andar modi ke samarthakon ke sankhya bhi lagaataar ghat rahi he or unke liye is baar sankat se nikalnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 There is also speculation that Pawar could use his position to convince Modi to step down after he took a dig at Modi and took political color to the issue
 manohar or pavaar ke bich kya baatcheet hui is bare main haalanki aadhikarik taur par pataa nahin chalaa he lekin is bayaan ke baad ki ‘sarvasammat or samuhik’ faisla kiya jayega, mana ja rahaa he ki yah modi ke liye bura sanket he
 Prior to the meeting with Manohar, Pawar also met Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Home Minister p Chidambaram
 manohar iske baad media or vitt samiti ke adhyaksh rajeev shukla or didisie adhyaksh or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa arun jetali se bhi mili or is mudde par charchaa kii
 The BCCI is in favor of resolving this issue as soon as possible but a lot will depend on how Modi approaches and defends himself
 sutara ne kaha, ‘agar modi adte hai to yah maamla aam sabha kii vishesh baithak main jayega jahaan is par voting ho sakati he
 "apart from this, there is a proposal in the BCCI to constitute a committee to investigate Modi's alleged financial irregularities, but some members are not in favor of it as the government has already decided to investigate all aspects of IPL

 Kangana Ranaut is seen in a gorgeous avatar in three minutes 19 seconds
 samooche trailor main sirf kangana hi dikh rahi hai
 In the film, she is playing the character of 'jhansi Ki Rani'
 manikarnika kangana ke kariyar kii duusari period film he
 Watch the trailer here: How is the trailer: The trailer begins with the British sitcom, which brings 'manikarnika' to save the people
 rajmahalon main pali manikarnika, aam nahin behad khaas he, iskaa ishaara kangana kii entry ke saath de diya gaya he
 With this, there is Manikarnika's entry in the trailer

 Kangnakangane has played the lead role in the film
 ection avatar main kangana ne behtareen parformens di he
 But in many places, the weight of Kangana's voice and character does not match
 film main kangana kii aawaaj par takneekee kaam najar aata he, ye baat saaf pataa chal rahi he
 However, Kangana's look in Rani's getup of Jhansi is superb
 pehali baar yoddha kaa role film main adaa kar raheen kangana ke liye ye film ek bada chalange he
 The trait and drawbacks of the character are clearly visible in the trailer
 deshbhakti, ection se bharpoor he manikarnika, damdaar hai ye 7 dialogfilmako bhavy banane kii koshish trailor main najar aati he
 Camera work also seems fine
 lekin content ke hisaab se film kaa becoground score bahut shandaar anheen ban padaa he
 Since Jhansi's Rani's personality is reflected in different dimensions in the trailer, it will be interesting for the audience to see her entire personality in the film
 film main kai bade star kaam kar rahe hai
 Among them are Danny, Ankita Lokhande Nazar, Suresh Oberoi, Kulbhushan Kharbanda
 ye film nirmaan ke dauraan se hi charchaa main rahi he

 The epicenter of this earthquake is not in India but in Afghanistan but due to its depth being 180 kilometers, its threat was felt far and wide
 haalanki afghanistan main aae bukamp kii tivrata mahaj 5
 It was 5 and cannot be classified as a dangerous earthquake
 lekin hindukush kii pahadiyon main ho rahi halchal puure ke puure desh main logon kii dhadkan badha rahi he
 Because a large part of India is very sensitive to earthquakes
 uttar bharat or purvottar bharat kaa zyaadaatar hissaa bukamp ke maamle main kaaphi khatarnaak mana jaataa he
 Himalayas are the cause of earthquake here
 himalay main chal rahi bhugarbheey hulchale bukamp aane kaa ek bada kaaran hai
 According to the theory of plate tectonic, there is a collision between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate in the Himalayan region
 bhartiya plate urasian plate ke neeche ghus rahi he or is vajah se is ilaake main bukamp aate rahete hai
 The high mountains of the Himalayas are the result of this collision
 bhartiya plate har saal amuman 40 se 50 millimetre urasian plate ke neeche ghus jaati he
 Because of this, the Himalayas are one of the most active regions around the world in terms of earthquakes
 bhartiya plate or urasian plate kii takkar kaa ilaaka sindhu or bramhaputra nadiyon kaa kshetra he
 The high peaks of the Himalayas located south of these two rivers have always been shaken by earthquakes
 is vajah uttar bharat main bade-bade bukamp aae hai
 - 7 in 1905
 5 kii tivrata kaa bada bukamp kangra main aayaa tha, isamen hajaaron log maare gaye the or kaaphi vinaash hua tha
 - 8 in Bihar in 1934
 1 kii tivrata kaa vinaashkari bukamp aayaa tha
 Thousands of people died in this earthquake too
 - 15 agast 1950 main assam main 8
 There was an earthquake of magnitude 6, in which there was a lot of destruction
 - 2005 main kashmir main 7
 There was a big earthquake of magnitude 6 in which thousands of people lost their lives
 ye bukamp to maatr baangi bhar hai
 Such devastating earthquakes have rocked the Himalayas
 kaha ja rahaa he ki puure himalay main halchal badi hui he
 In such a situation, there is no denying the danger of a devastating earthquake
 bharat main koi bhi aisi jagah nahin he jo bukamp ke lihaaj se surakshit ho
 Scientists have divided the entire country into four categories in terms of earthquakes
 dilli or ensiaar samet desh ke kai ilaake bukamp ke lihaaj se samvedansheel ilaakon main aate hai
 Seismic Zone 5, ie the most dangerous area in terms of earthquake
 jone five kaa matlab he yahaan aath kii tivrata se zyada kaa bukamp aa saktaa he
 This zone covers the entire North East area of the country, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal areas, Kutch in Gujarat, North Bihar and Andaman and Nicobar Islands
 sismik jone 4 bukamp ke lihaaj se ye bhi kaaphi khatarnaak mana jaataa he
 7 to 7 here
 9 tivrata tak bukamp aa sakate hai
 This zone includes the capital Delhi, NCR region, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, UP, Bihar and West Bengal, northern parts of Gujarat and Maharashtra and Rajasthan adjacent to the west coast
 jone 3 ko bukamp ke lihaaj se madhyam khatre vaala mana jaataa he
 This zone includes the remaining areas of Kerala, Goa, Lakshadeep, UP, Gujarat and West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 desh kii baaki jagahen sismik jone 2 main aate hai
 It is less dangerous in terms of earthquake
 yahaan 4
 No danger of earthquake of more than 9 magnitude
 yani bukamp ke lihaaj se desh kaa koi hissaa surakshit nahin he
 Therefore, it would not be wise to take the risk of earthquake lightly

 While the opposition is trying to capitalize on this by making it an issue in the elections, the government is denying Rafael's allegations
 magar ab rafel ko lekar soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat ek nai baat saamne ai he
 The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has refused to give details of its audit of the disputed Rafale aircraft agreement
 sieji ne kaha ki rafel qaraar ke ankekshan kii prakriya abhi puri nahin hui he or abhi koi khulaasa karne se sansad ke visheshadhikaar kaa hanan hoga
 The CAG gave this information in its reply to an application filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act on behalf of activist Vihar Durve based in Pune
 desh ke ankekshak ne kaha, ‘ankekshan main pragati ho rahi he or report ko abhi antim rup nahin diya gaya he

 Even though Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) President Om Prakash Chaitala and his elder son Ajay Singh are lodged in Tihar Jail on charges of teacher recruitment scam, Ajay's 18 Janpath bungalow in Delhi on 20 August was quite hot
 haryana main is saal aktubar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle chautaala ke chote bete abhaya chautaala chaar baar congress ke saansad rahe avatar singh bhadana kaa baanhen failaae party main swaagat kar rahe the
 And Bhadana also failed to get angry: “hooda is the Congress in Haryana, not Congress
 hooda robert wadra ke jameen ghotaalon ko lekar sonia gandhi ko blackmel kar rahe hai
 All self-respecting Congressmen are leaving the party
 ”is bangale se bamushkil do kimi dur mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ke pandit pant maarg vaale bangale par agle din aisi hi bheed najar ai
 People of full height in white pajama-kurta or pant-shirt encamped with their supporters in the courtyard of the bungalow in the hope of ticketing
 or ghute hue netaa hooda unhen aashwast kar rahe the
 These two bungalows, despite having two opposite axes of politics, have a similarity - that is the capture of Jat politics
 sirsa kaa chautaala parivaar or rohtak kaa hooda parivaar us jat jati se taalluk rakhata he, jisane haryana ke 20 main se 13 mukhyamantri die hai
 And anyway, why not 1 here
 20 karod votaron main se kareeb 24 fisadi jat samudaay ke hi to hai
 That is why here the equation of politics largely revolves on the axis of Jat and non-jat
 isiilie teesri or nai takat bijepi kaa ganit he ki uske paas aae congress ke jat netaa jaaton kaa vot kaatenge or baaki jat vot congress or chatala main bant jaaenge
 In such a situation, non-jat voters will make way for the party to form the government on their own for the first time
 haryana ke bijepi prabharee jagadish mukhi yah bataanaa bhi nahin bhoolatey ki ab tak congress or ieneldi sareekhe rajya ke duusare dalon se 100 se zyada log party ke saath jud chuke hai
 He says, “we have been joined by senior leaders like Chaudhary Birendra Singh, 9 former state ministers, 11 former mlas and prominent officials of opposition parties
 ”yah uplabdhi myne rakhti he
 Especially when the Chautala family of Tau Devi Lal has been the center of purely Jat politics here
 vahiin, congress ke hooda ne khud ko jat-dalit gathjod par khadaa kiya he
 On the other hand, Haryana Janhit Congress, the party of the late Bhajanlal's son Kuldeep Bishnoi, belonged to the Vaishya community, on the initiative of mobilizing non-jat votes
 haalanki kuldeep is sameekaran ko saadh nahin paae, lekin pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya janata party ne yah kar dikhaaya
 There is an atmosphere of confusion in the Congress between these changing equations
 kabhi pradesh congress ke diggaj netaa rahe raav indrajit singh loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi paala badalakar bijepi main chale gaye or gudgaanv se saansad banane ke baad centre sarkaar main rajyamantri hai
 Congress General Secretary Chaudhary Birendra Singh also turned away from the party before the assembly elections
 kabhi hooda ke dost rahe vinod sharma ne jan chetana party bana lee
 Within the party, Captain Ajay Yadav and Kiran Choudhary are eyeing Hooda
 haalanki hooda is bhagdad ko nazarandaaj karte hai, “loktantr main sabko apni party chunane kaa haq he
 This will not affect the electoral prospects of the Congress
 ” (dekhen baatcheet)
 But all this is happening at such a turning point, when the BJP has flown in 7 out of 10 seats in the Lok Sabha elections held three months ago
 yahi nahin, lagaataar pichley teen vidhansabha chunaavon main 9 fisadi voton ke aasapaas simtane vaali bijepi raturaat 35 fisadi vot bator le gai
 Not only this, Hooda, the political heirs of Devi Lal, the ruler of Jat politics, also lost sleep
 bijepi ke hausale is kadar buland hai ki party ne loksabhaa main sahyogi rahi haryana janhit congress ke naaj-nakhre uthaane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The condition is that on August 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared official but by nature, the Chief Minister was present on the stage when he reached Kaithal for a party rally, but Kuldeep Bishnoi was nowhere to be seen
 jabaki donon partiyon main loksabhaa main gathjod tha
 Listen to Mukhi's comment on the possibility of an alliance, "we are in favor of an alliance, but the old formula will no longer work
" agar gathbandhan nahin hua to party sabhi 90 siton par chunaav ladgaye ko taiyaar he
 "in the midst of all this, Hooda is hoping that the Congress will get his traditional Dalit vote, along with him being a Jat leader, Jat will join him
" unhen apane kaarykaal main hue vikaas kaaryon or kisaanon ko di ja rahi bahut-si riyaayaton se badi ummid he
 He is also expected to get the support of the middle class by increasing the retirement age of government employees by two years
 maje kii baat he ki is varg par bijepi kii nigaah sabase zyada he
 On the other hand, INLD has expectations
 agar saamaanya avasar hota to is chunaav main ieneldi kii jeet kii sambhaavna hi jataai jaati kyonki 2009 ko chhod den to pichley 30 saal main haryana kii satta kii chaabi ek baar congress ke haath main or ek baar chautaala parivaar ke haath main rahi he
 But this time the situation is different
 apane hare kalgidaar safe main janata se judye vaale omprakash chautaala chunaav prachaar ke liye uplabdh nahin hai or unke sahabjade ajay bhi jail main hai
 Abhay visits and consults father and brother in jail, but it cannot compensate for Chautala's direct presence in the election
 abhaya bhi is baat ko sweekaar karte hai
 (see conversation) Election is also stuck in terms of data
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 35 or congress tathaa aeneldi ko kramshru 23 or 24 fisadi vot mili the
 When the equation of votes reaches this granular level, then the Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati is remembered on the plank of Haryana
 unki party pichley teen vidhansabha chunaav or pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 4 se 6 fisadi ke bich vot hasil karti rahi he
 But this time Mayawati got the former MP from the Congress car Dr
 arvind sharma par daanv khelaa he
 Mayawati clearly stated, “the party will contest elections alone in Haryana on the pattern of Uttar Pradesh
 brahman samudaay ke sharma party ke mukhyamantri pad ke pratyaashee honge
 "if Mayawati's dalit-brahmin coalition manages to leave a mark, the balance of political figures in the state could be shaken

 In such a situation, huge possibilities of changing the market are open on first negotiation and then the deal is not sealed
 haa, ieneldi ne tikat ghoshit kar apane pattey khol die hai
 In such a situation, on whom the farmers of Haryana, who are facing 60 percent less rain among the convoys of election rallies and dusty cars, will vent the anger of Indra Dev, for this, keep an eye on the chapels where the hookah keeps moving around neatly

 parmaanu kshamta se sampann donon padosi desh aazaadee ke baad se hi kashmir par takaraav kii sthiti main rahe hai
 Kashmir is divided into two countries
 bharat or pakistan in vibhajit bhaagon main alag-alag shashan vyavastha chalaate hai, lekin donon puure kashmir par apana daawa karte hai
 Khurshid said that India routinely accuses Pakistan's military of firing it to divert attention when armed rebels infiltrate across the border
 ye vidrohi seemaa paar karne ke baad hamale kiya karte hai
 In an interview to The Australian newspaper, Khurshid acknowledged the tension in the relationship between the two countries
 khurshid ne kaha, ham samay-samay par pakistan se baat karte rahete hai or nijee bhav-bhangimaaon main hamen kaaphi garmjoshi dikhaai padati he
 Khurshid said, but the ground reality and the results of our meetings are very disappointing
 haalanki pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne pichley maah bharat ke saath shanti behaal karne kii disha main 'atirikt prayaas' karne kii patibaddhta jataai thi, khurshid ne kaha ki bharat unki baat par gaur karegaa
 Written by Khurshid, Pakistan faces very difficult problems within its own country
 hamaara maananaa he ki hamen unhen samay dena chahie
 Although we will not give this time at our cost, but we should give them the benefit of doubt

 According to weather experts, there is a possibility of good snowfall in all areas of Himachal from 4th date

 This round of rain and snowfall will last till 5th and 6th

 With this, the temperature will remain high here in the midst of strong sunlight
 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan he ki yahaan par 5 janvari tak din ke taapmaana saamaanya ke mukaable 5 degree upar bane rahenge
 This simply means that daytime temperatures in Delhi and surrounding areas will be recorded around 25 ° C

 Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal has claimed to bring an educational revolution, just like the economic revolution, in terms of providing free and compulsory education to every child
 unhone somvaar ko kaha ki bacchon ko muft or anivaary shiksha kaa adhikaar dene gunvattta vaali shiksha or prashikshit shikshak muhaiyaa karana samprag sarkaar kii praathamikta he
 Sibal, while replying to the discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Bill to children between six and 14 years, said that this revolution will come only through the partnership of state governments and every section of society

 After the minister's reply, the House passed the bill voice-over after Sibal's amendments were approved and the cpi-m's Moinul Hasan rejected the amendments
 sibbal ne apane jawaab main kaha ki har rajya main paristhitiyaan alag alag hai isliye padosi skool kahaan sthapit karne hai yah rajya sarkarein tay karengi
 At the same time, the states will decide how to provide reservation in schools to the children of disadvantaged and weaker sections as per the provisions of the bill

 ye ashanka akhir kis aadhaar par jataai gai ye samajhane ke liye hamen himalay ke nirmaan ko samajhnaa hoga
 According to geologists, the earth was divided into two major continents about five hundred million years ago
 uresia or gondvanaa land
 In the course of the development of the earth, Gondwana land was scattered in many pieces and moved towards different directions
 iskaa ek hissaa jo bhartiya upmahadweep bana wo uttar kii ore urasian plate se takaraayaa
 The folds formed by the same bump and rub between the two plates form the Himalayas
 ye takkar jari he or nateeja ye he ki himalay kii oonchai aaj bhi bad rahi he
 The Indian plate is still pressurizing the Eurasian plate at the rate of five centimeters per year or, say, sliding under it
 donon platon ke bich bad rahe is dabaav main chuphi urja rah rahakar jab release hoti he to yahaan bukamp aate hai
 There have been earthquakes of around eight magnitude in this Himalayan region
 jaise 1897 main shilong, 1905 main kangra, 1934 main bihar nepal border or 1950 main assam kaa bhayanak bukamp
 This is the one thousand kilometer long belt between Kangra and Shillong where there is terrible restlessness under the ground
 ise central sizmik gap kaha jaataa he
 Here the increasing pressure between the two tectonic plates is sitting within it, containing terrible energy
 tippaniyan The earthquake in Nepal has been a source of release of this energy
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya iske baad ye silsilaa tham jayega? jawaab he nahin
 The Indian plate continues to collide with the Eurasian Plate and this pressure may be further exposed in the form of another earthquake in another area
 sabase zyaada ashanka he central sizmik gap main
 Now the only way to avoid damage from such earthquakes is to use seismic technology in building construction
 ye samajhadaari hamen viraasat main bhi mili he jise ham chote-chote laalchon kii vajah se bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 By the way, it is said that earthquake does not kill us

 This collision continues and the result is that the height of the Himalayas is increasing even today
 bhartiya plate aaj bhi paanch centimetre prati varsh kii dar se urasian plate par dabaav bana rahi he yaa kahen ki uske neeche khisak rahi he
 Earthquakes occur here when the energy released between the two plates is released while staying under the hidden energy

 The Aam Aadmi Party once again disagrees with the Election Commission hearing in the Office of Profit case
 party vidhayako ne puure maamle main chunaav ayog par paksh na sunne kaa aarope lagaate hue hoicourt main rit daakhil kii he
 AAP MLA Alka Lamba said that Aam Aadmi Party mlas have moved the High Court on Friday
 alka lamba ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet karte hue chunaav ayog par kai bade aarope lagaae hai
 He said that earlier the High Court overturned the decision of the Election Commission
 lekin ab bhi chunaav ayog aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ke vakil ko yachikakarta se sawaal jawaab nahin karne de rahaa he
 The AAP mlas have asked why the Election Commission wants to save the petitioner? The AAP MLA has given clarification by denying the office of profit
 hoicourt dobaaraa jane kii vajah poochne par alka lamba kaa kahana he ki sabhi 70 vidhayakon ke paas daphtar hai
 But those offices did not meet as parliamentary secretary
 is shankaa ko dur karne ke liye yachikakarta or jawaab daakhil karne vaale adhikariyon se poochtacha honi chahie
 It is so clear that the Aam Aadmi Party mlas do not agree with the second hearing in the Election Commission
 alka lamba kaa aarope he ki chunaav ayog jis tarah sunwaayee kar rahaa he wo saafe taur par dawaab main nazar aa rahaa he
 The hearing has been settled for 10 days from May 17 to May 27
 isse pehle 19 farvari ko faisla aata he or 21 farvari ko raashtrapati kii mohar lag jaati he
 If the High Court did not give us relief, then it had done an undemocratic work
 ye poochne par ki kya aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon ko sadsyta jane kaa dar sata rahaa he
 In response, Alka Lamba said that it is not a matter of membership of 20 mlas
 yah sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par kam ho rahe vishwaas kaa maamla he
 We are not worried about the chair, but the game played with democracy
 hamen ummid he ki hoicourt hamaara paksh sunegaa
 In Jhansi, UP, the police have arrested 6 people for the business of blood

 puliceor aushadhi vibhaag ne soochna ke baad aropiyon kii giraftaar kii
 On receiving the information, Inspector of Drugs Department Umesh Kumar along with the Bharti Police team reached a house in Digara village

 The police team also freed 7 people taken hostage there
 mukt karaae gaye logon ne police ko bataaya, is kaarobaar ko anup gupta naam kaa yuvak chalaa rahaa he
 He was the one who kept them hostage in the house
 peediton ke anusaar, unhen pehle sharaab pilaai jaati thi
 Their blood was then extracted
 agar koi iskaa virodh karata to uske saath marpet kii jaati thi
 The victims said that this fraud has been going on for a long time
 khun nikaalane ke baad use jhaansi keblad bankemen bechaa jaataa tha
 Police are currently interrogating the arrested accused
 police pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki vah log shahar main khun kahaan-kahaan bechate the
 Also, who used to buy blood from them in the blood bank

 Laxman Gilua has been made the new state president of Jharkhand BJP
 pashchim singhbhum ke bijepi saansad lakshmana gilua ko pradesh adhyaksh kii jimmevary die jane par mukhyamantri raghuvar das ne badhai di
 The Chief Minister said that under his leadership, the party will touch new heights
 anusuchit janajati ke gilua 54 saal ke hai or inaki shaikshanik yogyata ucch madhyamik he
 Significantly, the former state president of BJP, Marandiqi, was in danger due to his son's marriage with a minor, and the BJP was looking for a new tribal face
 marandi ke liye kursi bachaana mushkil tharaajanneeti main shuchita kaa paracham uthaane kaa daawa karne vaali bijepi jharkhand main ho rahe ghatnakram par paini najar gadaaye hue thi or vivaad gaharaata dekh party ko fajihat se bachaane ke liye kade faisle lene ko taiyaar thi
 Actually, the BJP was getting very dirty in the state because of the son of the state president
 jahaan ek ore pradesh ke vipakshi dal is ghatana ke virodh main lamaband ho gaye the, vahiin yah khabar galat vajahon se rashtriya str par surkhiyaan bhi bator rahi thi
 In such a situation, it became very difficult for Tala Marandi to save his chair
 duusari taraf is ghatana kii vajah se bijepi shasit is rajya main pradhanmantri modi ke mahatvakankshi 'beti bachaav-beti padhaao' muhim ko bhi jhatka laga tha
 The new leader did not meet the Santhal Parganas
 The party wanted that this responsibility should be given to any tribal leader from Santhal Parganas
 is silsile main rajya ke bal vikaas kalyaan mantri louis marandi kaa naam bhi uchhla tha, lekin bataaya jaataa he kii luis iske liye taiyaar nahin hui
 In fact, the BJP is weak in Santhal Parganas, which is called the jmm's stronghold, despite its factionalism and tussle, the party could not get any tribal face from this area
 chunki rajya main gaiyr adivasee mukhyamantri he, is vajah se party ko ek adad adivasee netaa kii zarurat thi, or lakshmana gilua feet ho gaye

 Principal Suspended Iqbal wrote 117 years ago in 1902 on the song 'lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Banke Tamanna Meri'
 This strange incident happened in a famous school in the famous Rachnipilibhit district recently when its principal was suspended because the children in his school were suspended
 The famous poet Iqbal's classic work 'lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Banke Tamanna Meri' was taught
 principal ke nilamban kii karrwai jiladhikari ne vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) or bajrang dal kii shikaayat ke baad kii
 The principal of a government school in Pilibhit was suspended on the complaint of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the local unit of the Bajrang Dal
 in sanghathanon kaa aarope he ki chaatr subah kii prarthana main 'lab pe aati he dua banake tamanna meri' geet ga rahe the
 The poem 'lab Pe Aati Hai Dua' was written in 1902 by Mohammad Iqbal, famous as Allama Iqbal
 ikbaal ne hi 'saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara' ko bhi likhaa tha
 'lab pe aati dua' is still sung in many parts of the country
 pakistan ke har madrase or skulon main ise rojaanaa gaaya jaataa he
 It is surprising to see the principal suspended when the 117-year-old sings this song
 kareeb 270 vidhyaarthiyon vaale skool main phurkan ali na keval principal the balki akele shikshak bhi the
 There is no teacher left in the school after his suspension and the school is closed
 uttar pradesh main kai skool aise hai jahaan par puure skool kii jimmedaari ek hi shikshak par he
 What is the matter? According to the report, Block Education Officer (BEO) Upendra Kumar initiated an investigation into the complaint of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
 unhone apni jaanch main paaya gaya ki skool main bachche subah kii sabha main aksar yahi kavita gaate the
 On this matter Pilibhit district officer Vaibhav Srivastava said that the principal has been suspended because he did not get the students to perform the national anthem
 principal agar chaatro ko koi anya kavita padhaanaa chaahate the, to unhen anumati leni chahie
 If he sings a poem to the students and does not make the national anthem, then charges are made against him
 nilambit prisimple ne thukraayaa aaropahaalanki nilambit shikshak phurkan ali (45) ne apane upar lage aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 He says that the students continuously perform the national anthem and Iqbal's poetry is part of Urdu syllabus from classes one to eight
 unhone aage kaha, 'vihip or hindu yuva vahini kaaryakartaaon ne mujhe nikaalane kii maang karte hue skool or colectoret ke baahar virodh kiya
 i have only sung the poem which is part of the syllabus of the government school
 mere chaatr bhi pratidin sabha ke dauraan 'bharat mata kii jai' jaise deshbhakti ke naare lagaate hai
 Devendra Swaroop, the Basic Education Officer (BSA) of Pilibhit, said the complaint of the VHP and Bajrang Dal members is not against whether the national anthem is held or not, but has opposed Iqbal's poem
 vihip ke jila pramukh ambarish mishra ne kaha ki unhone sarkari primary skool main madrasa kii kavita ko gaae jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 On the eve of New Year in Delhi, a 17-year-old student has lodged a report with the police about the rape of her, after which two youths have been arrested
