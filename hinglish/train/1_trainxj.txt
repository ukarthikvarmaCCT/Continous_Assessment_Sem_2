 3611notanone of the Above1270610127161 During his fast against black money, Baba Ramdev, who has faced the strict action of police at Ramlila Maidan, came down in support of Gandhian Anna Hazare
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon ko mitaane main lag jaati he
 After accusing the Congress and the government of Hazare, Baba Ramdev issued a statement in Haridwar saying, "the government's conspiracy to crush the people's interest in the dictatorship is totally undemocratic, unconstitutional and irresponsible
" ’unhone kaha, ‘‘anna hazaare sahit jo bhi vyakti kaledhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he or andolan karata he, sarkaar bhrashtachar mitaane or kalaadhan desh main waapas laane ke bajaay us vyakti par hi aarope lagaakar use badnaam karne or mitaane main lag jaati he
 This is very unfortunate
 ’gauratlab he ki baba ramdev or unke samarthakon par police karrwai ke virodh main june main hazaare ne haalanki ek din kaa anshan kiya tha lekin kaha tha ki unke or ramdev ke bich kuch mudde hai jin par sthiti spasht hona jaruri he
 Only after this, some uncomfortable relations were seen in both
 abhi bhi hazaare or ramdev donon ne ek baar bhi khulkar yah nahin kaha ki ve 16 agast se prastaavit gandhivadi kaaryakarta ke anshan ke dauraan ekasaath maujuud rahenge
 The Enforcement Directorate has been investigating against Baba Ramdev's trust since the Ramleela Maidan incident

 oinstin ke E=mc2 (c scawair) ke pehle se hi vaigyanikon ne jaan liya tha ki parmaanu main aseemit urja nihit he
 This information was obtained from radioactivity
 (1945 main anistine ne ek lekh likhakar apane aapako parmaanu urja prapti kaa pita maanane se inkaar kiya tha
 He believed that his role in this process had been indirect) chemists Otto Han and Lise Maitner at the Kaiser William Institute in Berlin (germany) had been studying uranium atoms and studying their radioactive products
 baad main inke saath ek or rasayanashasri fritz straasmaan bhi jud gaye
 Originally physicist Lise Maitner was a Jew, he left Germany before being arrested in 1938
 haan or straasmaan apane prayog main jute rahe
 Attacking the atoms of uranium, he found that the atom had broken into about two equal parts
 unhen yaqiin nahin ho rahaa tha ki unka prayog safal ho gaya he
 Although he did not realize the consequences
 (otto haan ne kisi bhi tarah atom bam ke nirmaan main sahyog nahin diya) in parinaamon ko sabase pehle mahasoos kiya unke puraane saathi rahi lise mitener ne, inhone hi apane bhaanje otto frishch ke saath milakar use Nuclear Fission (nabhikeey vikhandan) naam diya
 They realized that energy is released in it and the broken parts run away from the terrible beg
 thik yahi prayog paris or america main bhi dohraye gaye
 Another thing that came to the fore in the experiment of Italian physicist Anaerica Fermi in the US was that in this process of nuclear fission, two new neutrons come out, they also have the ability to further fission
 isi se shrinkhalaa abhikriya (chain Reaction) or parmaanu bam kii kalpana hui
 Experiments so far have shown that the atom is fragmented, energy is released from fission and this could have happened in a chain reaction
 is ghatnakram ko do anya vaigyanikon ne oinstin ko bataaya or unase aagrah kiya ki ve apni mitra belgium kii maharani ko patr likhakar aagaah karen ki belgium congou ke kshetra hitler ke haathon main na padane paaen kyonki ye kshetra uranium ke prachur bhandar the
 Einstein did this but before that he also wrote a letter to US President FD Roosebelt
 is patr kaa uddeshy bhi germany dwaara parmaanu hathiyaaron ke nirmaan ke bare main aagaah karnaa tha
 Roosevelt took the first step towards the construction of the Atom Bomb and set up a nuclear committee
 1942 main is yojana ne raftaar pakadi or manhattan yojana banaai gai
 In December 1942, Nuclear Chain Reaction was successfully carried out in human history
 manhattan yojana ke aage tamaam sawaal ubhare, unamem se kuch the ki bam ke liye uranium yaa plutonium kii kitni maatra rakhni hogi? kitni urja paidaa hogi, uskaa pareekshan hawa, zamin yaa pani, kahan hoga? bam kaa aakaar kya hoga
 
 
 a separate place was set for this
 new mexico main ek gaanv los begaas ke paas viraan jagah kaa chunaav kiya gaya
 There was only a mcdonald Wrench house in the name of the building
 yahan jo laboratory banaai gai, colombia vivi
 Physicist J
 in robert openhimer ko diarector niyukt kiya gaya
 More than 1
25 million people were involved in the Manhattan plan under his leadership
 1943 se 1945 tak do varsh lage or chaar bam banakar taiyaar hue
 The uranium bomb was named Little Boy
 plutonium se bane bam ko fitman naam diya gaya
 Everything was ready in July
 ab pareekshan kii baari thi
 The code name for the test is 'trinity'
 isiyat main trinity (tridev) yani ishwar, ishwar ke putr or pavitra aatma shaamil hai
 In Hinduism, 'tridev' is called brahma-vishnu-mahesh
 july main hone vaali is prakriya se pehle hi germany, jisko dhyaan main rakhkar ye bam banaae gaye the, ne may main aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 Now what is the work of the atomic bomb? Vinoba Bhave has said that when science combines with politics, destruction is born
 sabhi sheersh vaigyanik chaahate the ki parmaanu bamon kii jaankaree soviet rus (jo us samay mitra rashtron ke saath tha) bhi di jaani chahie
 America did not do this
 isi dauraan rusebelt kii maut ho chuki thi
 Truman became the new president of America
 unka maananaa tha ki germany ne sahi to japan par bam giraakar yuddh samaapt kiya jaae
 Now came the turn of the trial, July 16, 1945, time 5:29 am
 
 
 plutonium vaale 'the Gadget' (jo aage fitman bana) ko ek tower par rakhaa gaya
 The director of the scheme, Openheimer, was watching it from several kilometers away
 bam jab fata to usase itati urja (prakaash) nikali ki openhimer ko gita kaa shloke yaad aayaa;divi suryasahasrasy bhavedyugapadutthita
 If the light that would be generated by the rise of thousands of suns together in the sky, like the Sāशीशीशीi-like Sybhāsastāsya Mahatmān, is also hardly like that poison

 Yuval Noa Harari has called it the biggest and glorious moment of the last 500 years in 'sapiens'
 unke anusaar manushya na sirf itihaas kii disha modane balki uske ant karne ke samarthy se las ho gaya
 Man himself had become God
 vah minuton main duniya ko nasht kar saktaa he
 The feeling of "I am God" arrived in America
 20 din baad japan ke do shahar is mahakaal kii shakti kii traasadee jheli
 Suffering from this terrible and destructive capability of bombs, Openheimer remained in mental torture all his life
 unhone kaha tha ki yadi yuddhrat deshon ke shastraagaar main atom bam jamaa hote rahe to maanavjaati mujhe shaap degi
 He later opposed the development of hydrogen bombs when he recognized the dangers of radioactivity
 neuyork main janme openhimer german-yahudee the
 These verses of Gita were memorized in English but they knew Sanskrit (language)
 gita kaa adhyayan kar rakhaa tha

 isliye los vegas main unhen gita ke shloke yaad aae
 In later years, he was considered a Communist in American and declared a threat to the country
 (16 july 1945 main subah 5:29 minutepar ye pareekshan kiya gaya tha

 se prakashit) The debate on social media has started after the picture of a model walking breast-feeding while walking the ramp
 model maaraa martin ne apni navjaat bacchee ko ramp vaak ke dauraan brestfding karaayaa
 Many people have supported it, while many have raised questions
 miami main hue Sports Illustrated magazine ke fishan sho main model aakhri 16 main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The model's daughter is just 5 months old
 model ne ramp vaak ke dauraan bikini pahan rakhaa tha
 In the observer's eyes, this photo is not obscene: HC was the model confidant and smiling
 magazine ne oficial instagram pej par ramp vaak ke video ko bhi post kiya
 After this, many people have also appreciated it
 kai mahilaon ne kaha he ki model ke is kadam se kaam ke dauraan brestfding ko badhaava milegaa
 Some other women wrote that many women would feel comfortable about their body after watching this model video
 @steaphanyw ne likhaa ki shukriya yah dikhaane ke liye brestfding natural hota he, ashleel nahin
 @heidi_steinmetz wrote that it matters a lot
 kyonki aapane apratyaksh rup se hi kaam ke dauraan brestfding karaane ke liye ek campan shuru kar diya he

 If a batsman does not know where he is going to bat, then the conditions are not easy for him, but Dhoni is telling this to the team and if captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes then the team needs Kohli at number four
 It is more

 The mata-pita ko apane bacchon kii tarif karne se pehle do baar sochna chahie kyonki australia main kiya gaya ek nayaa shodh kahata he ki bacchon kii jarurat se adhik tarif or bal pratadna ke bich ek gaharaa sambandh he
 During his research, Tony Nobel, an expert at Australian Catholic University, found that self-esteem is also associated with praise and harassment
 tippaniyan Nobel said, "some of the children who torture other children develop a sense of belonging to others because of the greater appreciation of the parents
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘ yah ek galatfahami he ki khud ko kamatar maanane vaale bachche hi duusare bacchon ko pratadit karte hai
 "according to a local media report," If you instill in children a sense of privilege, then it instills in them the feeling that they are entitled to get what they want
 ’’ isse bacchon main dabangai or aakraamakata badhati he or isiilie mata-pita ko vaastaviktaa ke aadhaar par hi bacchon kii tarif kerani chahie
 Another psychiatrist said, "it is very important for us to understand that parents should have some control over children

 It was what i needed to do for my overall health

 On 18 August, PIB had accepted the day of Subhash Chandra Bose's death and declared it his death anniversary
 re ne buudhvaar ko telephone par landan se pitiai ko bataaya, ''main is faisle kaa swaagat karata hum
 "PIB tweeted on Sunday," PIB remembers the great freedom fighter Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose on his death anniversary
 ''haalanki netaji ke parivaar ke ek varg ne iskaa virodh kiya tha, jiske baad ise waapas le liya gaya tha
 Grandson of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose had said that the mystery related to Netaji's disappearance is yet to be solved and any announcement about his death should be made only by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 chandra kumaar bose ne twit kiya, ‘‘raashtra netaji se jude rahasy ko samaapt hote dekhnaa chahta he, khaastaur par nihit swaarth vaale logon dwaara failaaye ja rahe jhuthe siddhanton ko rokane ke liye

 However, many believe that Netaji survived the plane crash
 varsh 2006 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh sarkaar ne sweekaar kiya tha ki renkoji mandir main rakhe avshesh netaji ke hai

 vahiin congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi gujarat chunaav ko lekar ji-jaan se jute hue hai or sattadhari bijepi par jamkar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 On the allegations being made by Rahul during the election campaign in Gujarat, the Gujarat government for development works, Amit Shah told reporters that the development of Gujarat is a joke for the Congress but it is a mood for us
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ko gujarat ke vikaas par sawaal uthaane kaa koi haq nahin he
 Shah said, 'we have done the Bhoomi Poojan of the primary health center and collector office of the Amethi in which there were three generations of Gandhi family members
 pehle congress saaf kare ki itane saal unhone yah sab kyon nahin kiya
 Amit Shah also said that there is a lot of difference between talking about development and development
 'gujarat ke aagaamee chunaav prachaar kaarykram ke bare main amit shah ne ajtak se vistaar se baatcheet kii
 Rahul Gandhi has accused of corruption? The Congress which committed scams of 12 lakh crores during 10 years of rule, Rahulji is coming to Gujarat today and accusing him of corruption
 koun sa bhrashtachar? is tarah ke aaropon se kuch nahin hota
 Who did the 2G spectrum scam? Who scamed ISRO? Who scam the Adarsh society? Who did the CWG scam? There is a list of scams, one must answer it first

 sawaal-gujarat chunaav main vikaas ke mudde par chunaav ladane kii baat kii ja rahi he, lekin jativaadee factor zyada dekhne mil rahaa he
 Answer - When the Congress fought the elections, then it was fought on the basis of casteist elections
 jatvaad ko badhaane kaa prayaas kiya he
 The bitter fruits of increasing casteism have been found since the time of Madhav Singh Solanki
 mujhe vishwaas he ki gujarat ki janata vikaas ke mudde par hi bharosa rakhegi or vikaas ke mudde par hi aage badhegi
 Question- Rahul Gandhi has talked about the removal of GST
 jawaab-rahul gandhi ne aisa maharashtra main bhi kaha tha, jharkhand main bhi kaha tha, assam main bhi kaha tha, uttarakhand main bhi kaha, uttar pradesh main bhi kaha tha, lekin kahin par bhi unki sarkaar nahin ai
 Question- PM Modi has inaugurated projects worth Rs 650 crore for Gujarat's Kutch area in the last few months
 lekin udghaatan ke 6 mahine bhi in projects par kaam shuru nahi ho sakaa he

 lekin narendra bhai ne pichley 12 saal main kai aise kaam kiye hai kuccha ke liye, jiske bhumi pujan bhi hue ore project bhi aae
 bjp's record is that we have inaugurated the one who has done Bhoomipujan
 ye wo congress he jisamen jawaharlal naheru ne bhumi pujan kiya or udghaatan narendra modi ne kiya
 Question- Rahul Gandhi says that the government is not taking action on Jai Shah

 Jai himself has gone to court
 congress par itane aarope lage hai, kabhi koi court main gaya he? jiske paas jo bhi saboot hai, use court main pesh karnaa chahie, kyon ghabara rahe hai
 New laws of question-income tax are coming
 jawaab-agar kahin samasya he to samvednaa ke saath use sunenge, use samajhenge or use hal karne kaa prayaas bhi karenge
 Question- What will we do to remove the anti-incumbency? Answer - We are roaming all over Gujarat
 agar kahin satta virdohi maahaul hogi to hamen bhi dikhegaa naa
 Question - Development has happened so why do BJP have to field so many big leaders? Answer - Election is a festival of democracy, but people have to go
 vaise jo kaam sarkaar ne kiye hai, use logon tak pahunchane ke liye lok sampark to karnaa hi hota he
 And we are putting big leaders in the election campaign, so where is the evil in that? so, bukamp aane par in baton kaa dhyaan rakhen, or apane mitron-naatedaaron ko bhi yah jaankaree den, taaki ham sab surakshit rah saken

 rasoi gas li hone se ghar main aag lag gai
 Father-son got severely scorched due to the fire
 donon ko jhaansi medical college aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 The condition of both of them remains critical here
 jaankaree ke mutabik,thana chirgaanv ke baral nivasee madan mohan (27) ke ghar kaa gas silendar khatm ho gaya tha
 He installed a new cylinder, from which the gas was leaking, but he ignored it
 usne chuulhe main silendar laga diya or jaise hi gas jalaai, kamare main aag lag gai
 Madan Mohan and his three-year-old son Brijendra were engulfed in flames
 parijan jab tak aag bujhane main kamayab hue, tab tak donon gambhir rup se jhulas gaye
 The family admitted both to the nearest health center, where their condition is stated to be serious
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ko lagata he ki agar ballebaaj bache hue do test maichon main shuruyaat karne ke baad out ho jaaen to mehmaan team ke liye yah thodi chintaa ban sakati he
 On the pitch on which England scored 569 for seven, the Indian team was reduced to 330 and 178 runs in two innings
 dhoni se jab poocha gaya ki kuch ballebaaj acchhee shuruyaat karne ke baad apana wicket ganvaa baithe to unhone kaha, agar iskaa lagaataar doharaav hoga to yah thodi chintaa kaa vishay ban jayega
 Hopefully this does not become a habit
 captain ne kaha, lekin acchhee baat yah he ki ballebaaj acchhee shuruyaat kar rahe hai or ummid karte hai ki ve in shuruyaaton ko badi pariyon main tabdeel karen
 a good start is more difficult than turning the start into a big innings
 ummid he ki ve majbootee se vaapasi karenge
 Dhoni also admitted that his batsman did not play off-spinner Moin Ali well
 sapaat pich par unki team kii asafalataa kii duhai dete hue dhoni ne kaha, ham unke jeetne kii ummid nahin kar rahe the, lekin yahi antarrashtriya cricket he
 We knew they would come back strongly and it was a new challenge for us to continue the momentum after the victory at Lord's
 dhoni ne kaha, hamaare ballebaaj tej gendbaajon ke khilaaf behatar khele, lekin hamane moin ali ko acchhee line evam length se gendbaaji karne di
 The pitch was very bad and it benefited him
 saath hi vahaan kaaphi kareeb main kshetrarakshak bhi the
 i think we should have been a little more positive against him
 shuru se hi bharat is test main pichhadaa-sa lag rahaa tha jaise ki lagaataar maichon kii thakaan team par haaavee ho gai ho
 The bowlers looked tired, the fielders missed important catches and missed the fifth bowler, forcing them to field seven batsmen this time
 dhoni se jab stuart binni ke rup main atirikt gendbaaj ko baahar rakhane kaa faisle ke bare main poocha to unhone kaha, is test ne hamen dikhaa ki kuch kshetra aise hai, jisamen hamen sudhaar karnaa hoga or test match jeetne ke liye hamen 20 wicket chatakaane kii jarurat hoti he
 But we could not even get 10 wickets in this match and it was definitely a setback
 maharashtra bijepi ke adhyaksh hai chandrakant patilkoored seat se chunaav lard rahe hai chandrakant patilpatil ke outsidar hone kaa mudda garmayamaharashtra bijepi ke adhyaksh chandrakant patil ke liye pehla vidhansabha chunaav hi kai morchon par chunauteepurn ban gaya he
 On the one hand, where NCP-MNS and Congress have united against Chandrakant Patil for the first time in the election, on the other hand, in the assembly seat from which Patil has got a ticket, he has to be two to four with the tag of Outsider
 is bahes se nijaat paane ke liye chandrakant patil ne ab apane dost ke ghar hi deraa daal liya he
 Chandrakant Patil, one of the strongest ministers in the Fadnavis cabinet, also holds the responsibility of the state president of BJP
 wo maharashtra vidhanparishad ke sadsy hai
 This time Chandrakant Patil is contesting the assembly elections
 ye patil kaa pehla chunaav he
 Chandrakant Patil has been given ticket from Kothrad seat in Pune
 bijepi ne sitting vidhayak medha kulkarni kaa tikat katkar chandrakant patil ko maidan main utaara he
 Chandrakant Patilman, who hails from Kolhapur, is believed that supporters of Medha Kulkarni are not happy with this decision of the party
 party ke ek tabake main chandrakant patil kii ummidavaari ko lekar naaraazgi he
 Now this resentment is focused on Chandrakant Patil's outward appearance
 kolhapur se taalluk rakhane vaale chandrakant patil ko pune kii kothred seat se pratyaashee banane par virodh ke swar saamne aa rahe hai
 So, to avoid this, Chandrakant Patil has now started staying at a friend's house
 saath hi ek karyaalay bhi kiraye par le liya he
 Understanding, not alliance: Raj Thackeray and Sharad Pawar Chandrakant Patil, who came together against bjp-shiv Sena, told PTI that it is not new to go elsewhere and contest elections
 unhone bataaya ki wo apane dost ke ghar rah rahe hai, lekin unhone koi agreement sin nahin kiya he
 Also, Chandrakant Patil also told that he has also hired an office to communicate with the public
 patil ke khilaaf ekajute hue virodhicothred vidhansabha seat par congress-ensipi ke saath MNS kii bhi anderstanding dekhne ko mili he
 MNS has fielded Kishore Shinde in front of Chandrakant Patil
 scindia majboot sthaneey netaa ke rup main jane jate hai
 NCP has not fielded its candidate here, while Congress has also announced the support of MNS
 yani chandrakant patil ko chunauti dene ke liye teenon pramukh vipakshi dal ekajute ho gaye hai

 east emsidi ne alag-alag ilaakon main kooda ikaitha karne ke liye dustbin kharidi kii yojana banaai, lekin dustbin kharide jate iske pehle east emsidi ke iraadaa badal gaya
 Now dustbins will be bought when officers are not afraid of bombing
 yah vakya jitna ajeeb he, utana hi dilachasp bhi he, kyonki afasaron ne jin dustbin ko kharidne kii yojana taiyaar kii, unki kamiyon or khaamiyon ko pehle hi gina diya
 Garbage will be scattered here and there in every area of delhi
 nae dustbin isliye nahin kharide ja rahe hai, kyoki east emsidi ke afasaron ko dar he ki inamen koi aatankwaadi bam rakh saktaa he or ise rokane kaa koi tarika unke paas nahin he
 Due to this fear of officers, the offer to buy new dustbin has been returned
 east emsidi standing cameti ke adhyaksh sanjay surjan ne kaha, 'sosayadi or duusari jagah nae steel ke dustbin kharidne kaa prastaav hamaare saamne aayaa tha, lekin vibhaag ne ashanka vyakt kii he ki peeche kai visphot dustbin main bam rakhkar kiye gaye the, aise main afasaron ne kaha ki iskaa koi upaay nahin he
 Therefore, we have refered the proposal
 dustbin kharide jane ke liye jo prastaav taiyaar kiya gaya he, usamen likhaa he ki kaamanwealth khelon ke pehle aatankwaadiyon ne bam visphot ke liye dustbins kaa istemaal kiya tha, aise main inhen lagaana khatarnaak ho saktaa he, kyonki emsidi ke paas aisa koi tarika nahin he, jisase wo dustbin main bam rakhane se roak sake
 Not only this, in the proposal to buy steel dustbin, it is also written that this dustbin can break quickly

 shaayari or smaili
 Two different modes of expression
 alag-alag kaal kii
 One is going through the stamp of being traditional and the other is being said to be modern
 agenda aaj tak ke duusare din shanivaar ko inhen donon vidhaon par tafasil se baat hui
 He is also the famous poet Munawar Rana, this time poet Kumar Vishwas, between actor Annu Kapoor and writer Amish Tripathi
 shaayari banaam smilicharcha kaa vishyatha- shaayari banaam smaili
 The intention behind this conversation was to know whether the style of expression has changed in the era of mobiles? Has smiley replaced nazm in love talk? When the talk of mobile happened, this lion of Uday Pratap was bound to come
 har faisla hota nahin sikaa oochaal ke, ye dil kaa maamla he jaraa dekhbhaal ke
 What did you know about the lover of mobiles, they used to take out the letter in the letter
 baat isi se shuru hui or isi baatcheet main smaili kii paribhaasha bhi garh lee gai
 Smiley Jhalak, Shayari tableauannu Kapoor said that smiley is change
 smaili sirf jhalak he or shaayari jhaanki he
 Munavvar extended this definition and said - When words start falling short, smiley is needed
 kumaar vishwaas ne smaili kii simaaen bhi bataa di
 Said- When someone dies in the house, the smiley does not work there
 baat ab badalte hue andaaj-e-bayaan par aa tiki
 The way of saying that in 144 characters, the challenge is to say everything
 haalanki annu kapur ne kaha ki fasebuk, twitor or watsape ke jamaane main ladke sher main abhivyakt kar rahe hai
 How meaningful this change was when it came to Facebook and whatsapp, Kumar Vishwas also tried to show the fine line between light and light literature
 isi charchaa main do udhaaharan aae
 One- When Salman Khan is released, the lion created by joining him and Asaram, in which Asaram's release is sought
 or doosraa- ikbaal sahab kaa sher ki thahari-thahari si tabiyat main ravaani ai, itani aasaani se milti nahin fan kii daulat, dhal gayi umr to gajalon pe javaani ai
 Munawwar also added that the weather is dry, his will ahead
 ishaara saaf tha, abhivyakti safal hui or watsape massej ke saath bheji smaili yahaan naakaam ho gai, halki ho gai
 Smiley's make up, Alankar Hoamish Tripathi, realizing Smiley's strength, said that he is an expression of today's era
 use khaarij bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Kumar Vishwas suggested a way of agreeing that smiley should also be adorned and decorated
 unhone smaili se mil rahi chunauti ko sweekaara ki sankat imoshan par he
 This is an instant crisis
 yah sankat patrakarita, sahitya or raajnneeti har jagah he
 Vishwas said- Our, Amish's challenge is that we write such that a boy or a girl can remove our poetry or a smiley for that one line
 ann ne bhi mana ki smaili or shaayari ek duje kii poorak hon or nai takat bane
 Do not consider smiley as your enemy
 bhashaa or bhashaa kaa sanskarasmaili kii bhi apni ek bhashaa he or bina bhashaa ke na kavita he, na kahani he or na hi shaayari
 So the language that came with Smiley was also talked about
 kumaar vishwaas ne ek kissa sunaaya
 His words - i was fifth
 tab padhata tha ki radha or krishna ke bich prem prakat hua
 When the love was revealed, inquiring of his teacher father, he got the answer - Love is God and it only appears
 phir naunvin main aayaa to padhaa peter phal in lav
 Curious as to why the love fell
 phir hindustan or angrejon kii samskruti kaa antar samaj aayaa ki shaayari, kavita, lekh hamen or hamaare vyaktitv ko paribhaashit karte hai
 We travel with those words

 There is a need for a major surgery in the next few months for which the housemates have come to Delhi from Orissa, hoping for help
 aareesha kii maa amarine akhtar logon se apil kar rahi hai ki sarkaar or aam log unki bacchee kii madad ke liye aage aae kyonki bacchee kii jindagi khatre main he
 According to Arisha's parents, in February 2013, soon after finding out the disease, Majumdar of Bengaluru took her to the Cancer Center, where doctoron ne kaha ki agali farvari main bone maro transplant karana hoga or is par 20 lakh se zyada kaa kharch aa saktaa he
 Dr
 Sunil Bhatt of Mazumdar Shea Cancer Center says that patients suffering from this disease have to give blood every month for a long time
 darasal, sharir main maujuud bone maro main red cell, white cell or platelets banate hai
 In this disease, red cell formation stops, which leads to serious consequences later

 The BJP, which has held the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) for the last 10 years, has captured the MCD for the third consecutive time

 With this, the BJP has also consolidated its domination on the MCD by pushing the Congress to the third position in the municipal elections
 nagar nigam main fail hui aapadilli nagar nigam par beete 10 saal se bijepi kaa paracham laharaa rahaa he
 The BJP made its place in Delhi Municipal Corporation by defeating the Congress in the 2007 elections and since then it has continued to dominate the Municipal Corporation
 haalanki 2016 main hue nagar nigam upachunaavon main 13 siton main sarvaadhik 5 siton par jeet darj kar dilli par shashan kar rahi aam aadmi party ne apana khaataa kholaa
 But now after winning just 41 seats in the 270 seats of the municipal corporation, it has become clear that she has been the victim of a big defeat at the hands of BJP in Delhi

 However, after the midterm elections in 2016, political experts believed that even though the Aam Aadmi Party was successful in opening its account, it is clear that the Delhi state has registered a decrease in the votes (vote percent) in its favor
 The catch has weakened after the unexpected results of the assembly elections
 ab emsidi chunaavon ke nateezon ne ek baar phir dikhaa diya he ki dilli par aap kii raajnneetik pakad lagaataar majboot ho rahi he
 The vote share of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been reduced to half that of the assembly elections
 aam aadmi party kaa vot pratishat vidhansabha chunaav ke mukaable 26 pratishat kam hua he
 54 in the assembly elections to the party
 3 pratishat vot mili the
 In 2007, the BJP won 164 seats in the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections
 in chunaavon main duusare number par 67 siton ke saath congress or 17 siton ke saath mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party thi
 At the same time, in the municipal elections held in 2012 after five years, BJP won just 138 seats and Congress got 77 seats
 in donon chunaav main sabase khaas yah rahaa ki anya yaa chote raajnneetik dalon or independent ne milakar 2007 main 41 seat or 2012 main 52 siton par jeet darj kar nagar nigam main apni ahmiyat banaai thi
 But due to the Modi wave in the current civic elections, while the hopes of the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have fallen, small political parties have also been wiped out
 vot percent main congress ko dabl phaaydanagar nigam chunaav main tisare sthaan par rahane vaali congress ko saal 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke mukaable is chunaav main 11 fisadi zyada vot mili hai
 The bjp's vote percentage, which won 181 seats out of 272 seats in the municipal elections, increased by 5 percent
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa pratishat 9
 Was 7 percent
 vahiin, emsidi chunaav main yah pratishat badhkar 21
 Is 28

 lekin hakeekat iske bilkul ulat he
 There are many things that women do not tell anyone
 yahi nahin baar-baar puche jane par bhi ve in baton ko sweekaarti bhi nahin hai
 In some cases she does this due to her nature, and sometimes she maintains a special image of her
 khaas baat yah he ki purush mahilaon se in baton ke bare main jaanane ko bekaraar rahete hai lekin ve kabhi in baton ko saamne nahin aane detii hai
 If you are thinking about what women are so royal about, then these are: 1
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki ek aurat, duusari aurat se sirf chidhati or jalan karti he par aisa nahin he
 Like men, women are also attracted to women with attractive personalities
 par ye baat wo kisi se bhi nahin bataatin, khaastaur par purushon ko
 2
 mahilaayein kabhi bhi apanepahale pyaar ko bhul nahin patihain
 He is fond of keeping information about them
 haalanki wo kabhi bhi iskaa zikr apane vartmaan partner se nahin karatin par unhen ye jaanane main khaasaa dilchaspee hoti he ki unka partner aajkal kiske saath he or kya kar rahaa he
 3
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki purush hi edlt filmein dekhte hai, par aisa he nahin
 Women also like to watch adult movies
 4
 Women like to stand in front of the mirror and behold themselves
 unhen alag-alag poj banaakar aaine ke saamne khadey hokar khud ko dekhnaa pasand hota he
 5
 mahilaon ko hameshaa lagata he ki unkapartner kuch na kuch unase chhipaata jarur he
 They always have the discomfort to know all this

 Jayalalithaa became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu five times after inheriting the legacy of her pioneer and superstar MGR, who wielded the magic of acting in Tamil cinema in the sixth and seventh decade
 raajnneeti main tamaam jhanjhaavaton kaa saamana karte hue unhone apni badaulat apana mukaam hasil kiya
 Jayalalithaa was born into a Brahmin family in Mysore, Karnataka

 68-year-old Jayalalithaa had to step down in corruption cases but was able to make a dramatic comeback on both the occasions
 nayika ke taur par jayalalita kaa safar ‘vennira adai’ (da white dress) se shuru hua
 He started in politics in 1982, after which MGR made him the Secretary of Publicity the following year

 The faction of leaders such as RM Veerappan, senior minister in the MGR cabinet, stymied the aiadmk's path to becoming the undisputed chief and faced a fierce struggle
 jayalalita ne bodinayakanur se 1989 main tamilnadu vidhansabha chunaav main jeet hasil kii or sadan main pehali mahila pratipaksh netaa baniin

 However, he lost power at the hands of his arch-rival DMK in 1996 due to allegations of corruption over a five-year tenure, heavy show at his adopted son's wedding and not performing as expected
 iske baad unke khilaaf aay ke gyaat strot se adhik sampatti sahit kai maamle daayar kiye gaye

 Released today is Abhishek Chaubey's film 'dedh Ishqiya', which is a sequel to 'ishqiya'
 
 
 film kii star cast main nasiruddin shah or arshad varsi shaamil hai, jo 'ishkia' main bhi the - khaalu or babban ke kirdaar main - lekin is baar cast main maadhuri dikshit bhi shaamil hui hai, jinaki 'dedh ishkia' kambek film kahi ja rahi he
 
 
 Along with him are Huma Qureshi, Vijay Raj and Manoj Pahwa in 'dedh Ishqiya'
 
 
 'ishkia' kii kahani shaayad aapako yaad hogi
 
 
 So of course, people would have expected from 'dedh Ishqiya' that Babban and Khalu would feed some new gulls and that is exactly what happened
 
 
 'dedh ishkia' mujhe 'ishkia' se behatar lagi
 
 
 The story is not different or unique, but the script presents it in a concrete way
 
 
 screenple or dialog aap par jabardast asar chhod sakate hai
 
 
 The performance and jugalbandi of Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi is amazing
 
 
 mujhe lagata he ki 'ishkia' main maujuud rahe kirdaar bhi is film main pehle se behatar nazar aate hai
 
 
 Wherever the comedy is in the film, it seems comfortable with stagnation
 
 
 jo log bematlab kii kamedi se pareshaan hai, shaayad unke liye 'dedh ishkia' raahat bhari ho sakati he
 
 
 Madhuri Dixit does not leave any deep impact in the film, but Huma Qureshi's performance is good
 
 
 vijay raaj or manoj paahwa parde par ek alag or acha asar chhod pate hai
 
 
 The first part of the film, ie before Interval, is quite an Ismetal of Urdu, which may not be liked by many, but i liked it
 
 
 haalanki film main sab-tital hai, so, samajhane main dikkat nahin hogi
 
 
 'our Atria 
 
 ' gaanaa acha he, or maadhuri kaa dance bhi, lekin huma kuraishi kii parformens maadhuri se behatar he
 
 
 Now speaking of flaws, the first thing is that the film is a bit long
 
 
 duusari baat, 'hamari atariyaa pe
 
 
 Except for the rest of the songs, they are not able to leave their mark and thirdly, the film depicts a past of the characters of Madhuri Dixit and Naseeruddin Shah, which you may find a bit strange, but you will probably forget the beauty of the film
 
 
 kul milakar 'dedh ishkia' behtareen film he, or is film ke liye meri reating he 4 star

 lagata he controvarsi punam pandey kaa doosraa naam he
 His debut film 'nasha' is going to be released on Friday this week, but before that there has been controversy
 mumbai main jagah-jagah punam pandey kii film ke bold poster lagaae gaye hai, jisase shiv sena ke kaaryakarta khaase naaraaz ho gaye hai
 On Monday, some Shiv soldiers uprooted Poonam Pandey's posters in Mahim, Lower Parel, Borivali and Andheri areas and burnt them
 posters main punam pandey bacoles or bikini pahane hue dikhaai de rahi hai
 Some protesters have even demanded a ban on the film
 in virodh pradarshnon se naaraaz punam ne soshal netwarking site par post kiya he, 'main hameshaa vivaadon main rahi hum, lekin main kahana chaahati hum sabhi vivaad achche nahin hote
 It definitely hurts me
 'nasha ke produsar aditya bhaatia ke mutabik, 'mujhe desh ke raajnneetik dalon kii dasha par dukh hota he
 They uprooted and burnt the posters of my film

 ' jammu-kashmir ke handwara main beete maheene ladki se chhedchhad kii ghatana ke baad bhadki hinsa kaa maamla phir garma saktaa he
 The girl initially said that the molester was not an Army soldier, but once again she has retracted the statement
 usne thane main shikaayat dekar sena ke jawan or pulicekarmiyon par yon utpeedan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The minor girl told the media on Monday that the man who had gone with her on April 12 was an Army soldier
 saath hi usne yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki use police ne galat bayaan dene ke liye majaboor kiya tha
 'he came and held my hand,' said the girl, 'I went to the bathroom
 tabhi baahar se sena kaa ek jawan aayaa or usne meraa haath pakad liya
 i ran out of there and screamed while running
 uske baad mujhe police stesan le jaaya gaya
 'the allegation was also made on the police officer, about a month after the incident, for the first time that the girl has given a statement in front of the media
 usne aarope lagaaya ki police use baar-baar hiraasat main lekar ek jagah se duusare jagah shift kar rahi thi
 He has also accused the policemen of harassment
 ladki ne kaha, 'pulisavaalon ne meraa utpeedan kiya
 i just kept crying
 wo baari-baari se aakar mere saath jyaadati karte rahe or main cheekhti rahi
 One of the officers who was a policeman came to me and spit on me
 ' ladki ne police vaale kaa naam mohsin bataaya he
 The SP also forcibly recorded the statement, accusing the police that the girl also said that they used to beat her and force her to change the statement
 ladki ne kaha, 'unhone mujhemaar-markar majaboor kiyaaki kisi bhi haalat main sach nahin bataanaa he
 Then the SP of the area came and said that he would record my statement
 bayaan main maine jo kuch bhi kaha vah sirf jabardastee kahalwaya gaya
 'please tell that after the incident on April 12, the girl was placed in a protective custody and left only last week
 kal raat main apane sahakarmi ke yahaan dinar par gai hui thi
 Booked an Uber cab from Noida Sector 21 to return home at 10
49 am
 mujhe sector 100 janaa tha
 It takes hardly 15 minutes to get there at night
 itane main hi ek safed hundai accent ubar cab mujhe lene pahunch gai
 My coworker left me to the cab
 iske baad cab main baith vakt driver meri taraf dekhakar muskuraayaa or ham ghar kii taraf chal die
 Within 4-5 minutes we reached the underpass of GIP Mall
 vahaan mujhase driver ne poocha ki mujhe kahaan janaa he
 When he spoke, i smelled of alcohol from his mouth, which was trying to hide him by drinking betel leaf
 iske baad maine baahar kii taraf dekhakar sochaa kii koi or rasta nahin he
 In a few moments the train turned towards noida-greater Noida Expressway
 sadak bilkul sunsaan thi
 When i saw the time, 10
 55 ho rahe the
 On the empty road, the driver was driving at a speed of about 100 km per hour
 itani speed mujhe dikkat to de rahi thi, lekin ghar jane kii jaldi main, main chupchaap baithi rahi
 Shortly after, the driver took the vehicle on the road in front of the expressway, turning left and the vehicle stopped immediately after taking a few shocks as soon as Sector 45 left
 maine jab driver se poocha to usne kaha, petrol nahin he
 After that it took me a few moments to understand what was going on
 phir maine driver se poocha "petrol nahin he matlab? aapako pataa nahin tha?" wo ekadam bolaa "mujhe nahin pataa tha" or iske saath hi sharaab or paan kii badboo teji se ai
 Then the driver opened the window and spit out the pan
 phir maine usase poocha "aapaki gaadi main petrol indicater nahin he" aise kaise aapako pataa nahin he?" usne bataaya kii indicater kharaab he
 Now i could not speak anything
 itane main hi driver ne gaadi ke lock band kiye or andar kii lite jala di
 i told him to turn off the light
 aap soch nahin sakate kii ham aisi jagah par ruke hue the, jahaan se aksar logon ko luutane or marpet karne kii khabaren aati rahati hai
 Then i got a call from my colleague whose house i came from
 phone milaate hue maine dekha kii driver bhi kisi ko kol kar rahaa tha
 On picking up the phone of my colleague, i told him that the cab i went with has run out of petrol and we are standing on a deserted road
 apane sahakarmi se baat karte karte mujhe driver kii kuch baaten bhi sunai di, jisame wo kuch "petrol" petrol pump" "expresve ke paas" "sawari" "client" shabd bol rahaa tha
 Till now, while calm myself, i was just looking for ways to get out of here that i heard the driver speak "woman"
 ye shabd mere liye aisa tha jaise koi dard kaa atake mujhe aayaa ho
 Still, handling my voice and condition, i told my friend my correct location on the phone
 vah mujhe lene ke liye ghar se nikal gaya tha
 Now the driver asked me "have you called someone to pick you up?" i answered him yes
 phir usne kaha "aap 10 minute ruk jaaiye meraa bhai petrol lekar aata hi hoga
 "well, i ignored his point and then called my colleague and checked to see where he has come
" usne bataaya kii vah bas expresve par hi he
 Around 11 at the time
 05 hue the
 During this time, the driver called the same two people, whom he had talked to a while back
 main us samay apane aap ko samajhane main lagi hui thi kii sab thik hoga, vivek bas aane hi vaala he
 Meanwhile, many vehicles passed by there, i saw a Uppuliski car also going, but they were very fast
 kuch minute rukne ke baad maine apni ek or friend ko kol milaayaa or samaanya dikhne kii koshish main use bataaya kii bas vivek pahunchane vaala he
 After that the driver also called his brother and talked
 taqariban 11 bajkar 12 minute par vivek kii car hamaare paas pahunch gai
 After that i asked the driver to cancel my trip and sat in Vivek's car
 usne trip cancil nahin kii or mujhe ghurkar dekha
 We got out of there and i canceled the trip on the way
 gaadi main maine vivek ko thoda halke tareeke se puri kahani bataai
 Vivek left me at home and went back
 ghar jane ke baad lagbhag 10 minute main chupchaap apana sir pakad ke baithi rahi
 Throughout the night i kept remembering small parts of that incident
 yahaan tak ki sari ghatana ko twit karte hue bhi saham rahi thi
 i put two complaints about this in the Uber app
 maine ubar sahaayta ke twitor acount par bhi apni mail idi or number ke saath sidhaa massej kiya
 About half an hour later i received two emails from Uber
 ek main likhaa tha ki maine ek trip par kai baar shikaayat kii hai or ve problem ko jaanch rahe hai
 At the same time, in the second mail, he was not in the driver's touch due to the delay in the night
 phir agle kai ghante mere dost or jaankaar mujhe massej or kol kar mere haalchaal poochhate rahe
 i spent the entire night without sleeping to recover from this incident
 main jab bhi aankh band karne kii koshish karti, to mujhe us pal kii yaad aati
 When the driver stopped the car completely
 aaj subah twitor par doston or sahakarmiyon se mili acchhee saport ke baad, mujhe ubar kaa kol aayaa
 In this half-hour call, he told me that the driver's phone has been locked since the trip while he was investigating
 unhone mujhe yakeen dilaayaa ki uskaa acount suspend kar use ubar se nikaal diya jayega
 Now 20 hours after the incident, i just want to thank my friend who came to pick me up before the driver's brother
 or mere dost ke saath phone switch of or ekadam se gaadi kharaab ho jane jaisaa kuch nahin hua
 Because of which i reached my home safely

 kehete hai tasviren jhooth nahin bolti or ab chandigarh ke varnika chhedchhad maamle main tasveeron kii gavaahi bhi saamne aa gai he
 In the same high-profile molestation case of Chandigarh which has shaken the entire nation, two CCTV footage has now surfaced and in these footage, the car of accused Vikas Barala is seen chasing the car of the victim girl Varnika
 shahar kii do alag-alag jagahon par qaid hui ye tasviren varnika kii us horer story kii tasdik karti he, jisaki shikaayat usne police se kii he
 The case of molestation of Varnika Kundu, daughter of Haryana senior IAS Virendra Kundu, is in the news
 ghatana kaa mukhya aaropee bijepi ke pradesh adhyakshasubhash baralaaka betaa vikaas baraala he
 In the case of Vikas and his friend being granted bail from the police station, the subsequent removal of bayonets imposed on them, questions are being raised on the functioning of the police
 vahiin somvaar police ne ilaake ke 5 sisitivi footage baraamad kar liye hai jabaki pehle sisitivi footage naa milane kii baat sane ai thi
 The entire Khattar government of Haryana has been clouded because the slogan of the Haryana government's slogan 'beti Padhao, Beti Bachao' is being seen
 chandigarh kii sadakon par shanivaar raat 12 bajkar 32 minute par camaron main qaid hui sisitivi footage apane-aap main puri kahani bayaan karti he
 There is nothing strange about these pictures of two cars passing in the dark of the night
 lekin jab aap in car main savaar logon or unase judi mid nite horer kii puri kahani jaanate hon, to phir yahi sisitivi footage aapke rongte khadey kar detii he
 Yes, replying to those pictures incarcerated in camera may be overwhelming to Raiszade Vikas Barala and his friends who belong to the influential political family of Haryana
 vajah ye inhen sisitivi footage se judi kahani in raiszaadon kaa shikaar bani bahadur ladki varnika kundu pehle hi puri duniya main aam kar chuki he
 In the complaint given to the police, he has told how that night Vikas Barala and his friends not only chased him for a long time, but also tried to kidnap him from the middle road
 or ab saamne ai sisitivi kii ye tasviren varnika ke saath hue usee vaakye kii tasdik karti hai, uski gavaahi detii hai
 See from two different cameras that a black sedan is running on the streets of Chandigarh at full speed in the middle of the night, while just a few seconds later an SUV is seen chasing the car
 or haqiqat ye he ki ye sidan jahaan haryana ke senior iees afasar virender kundu kii beti varnika kundu kii he, jabaki peechha karti is esayuvi menharyana bijepi ke chifasubhash kaa betaa vikaas baraala or uske doston ke hone kaa ilzaam he
 According to Varnika, that night continued for about 20 to 25 minutes and she somehow lost her life
 ilzaamon se ghire raiszade shaayad in baton ko bhi jhuthla dete, in tasviren ko ittefaq bhi qaraar dete
 But these pictures of that mid-night horror were incarcerated in CCTV cameras at not one place in Chandigarh, but at three to four places and two of these CCTV pictures are still available with Aaj Tak
 lekin jab itane sisitivi camaron main ek si tasviren qaid hon, to unhen hawa main udaana yakeenan aasaan nahin ho saktaa
 It is another matter that now the political tug of war over these CCTV footage is fast
 baharhaal, ab inhen tasveeron kii binah par police vikaas baraala samet duusare mulzimon par shikanja or kadaa karne kii baat kah rahi he
 It remains to be seen whether this can actually happen in the coming times or whether everything proves to be airborne in front of the influence of the Barala family

 He said that the central government has allocated Rs 3 lakh 81 thousand crore under the Bihar Development Plan head, which is 10 percent more than the previous year
 unhone kaha ki begusarai main jald hi barauni fertilizer kaarkaane kaa punarnirmaan kaary bhi prarambh kiya jayega
 Minister of State for Sanitation and Drinking Water, Yadav said that the central government is helping Bihar a lot, but development in Bihar is going to corruption
 unhone kaha ki jab tak nitish sarkaar ko ukhaad nahin phenkaa jayega, tab tak bihar kaa vikaas sambhav nahin
 He said that RJD will be eliminated in the next assembly elections

 What AAP did for the environment in the last 5 years - Gambhir had already told about 'not joining the meeting', BJP MP Gautam, who was absent from meeting of Parliamentary Committee meeting on pollution and eating jalebi in Indore Gambhir, while clarifying, has accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of ignoring Delhi
 unka kahana he ki pichley 5 maheene se jab se vah saansad bane hai paryaavaran ke liye ke liye kaaphi kuch kaam kiya he
 After coming under attack from Delhi's Kejriwal government, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Gautam Gambhir hit back, saying, "I am an MP for the last 5 months
" paryaavaran ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya he
 But the same question will be asked by the Chief Minister what he did in 5 years
 pradooshan kam karne ke liye kuch bhi khaas upkaran kharida he
 On the question of not attending the special meeting called on environment, Gautam Gambhir said, 'I could not attend the meeting because the mail came to me on the 11th

 That's why i had to go there

 Has it ever happened to you that a man has seen you and he has not been able to remove the eyes from your face even if he wants to
 agar aap chaahati hai ki purushon kii nazren ek pal ke liye bhi aapke upar se naa haten, jab wo aapako dekhen to dekhte hi rah jaaen, to mohatarama aaj se hi apane honton ko laal rakhana shuru kar den
 Yes, a recent research has revealed that women who have more red lips tend to seduce men more
 is adhyayan ke anusaar, yun to mahilaon ke sharir ko har ek ang purushon ko aakarshith karata he, lekin mahilaon ke hoth unke sharir kaa sabase arkshak bhaag hote hai
 Beautiful and sensual lips not only attract men to women, but also red rose petals like ruddy red lips are very much liked by men
 visheshkar jab mahilaayein apane hothon par laal rang kii lipstick lagaati hai, to purush apane honton se unke laal hothon ko chhune ke liye utaavle hone lagate hai
 The red lips of women affect men so much that they are eager to spend more time with women
 agar mahilaayein gulabi rang kii lipstick apane hothon par lagaati hai, to purush 6 second tak unke chehre se apni najar nahin hataa pate, vahiin jab mahilaayein laal rang kii lipstick se apane hothon ko or kaamuk banaati hai, to vah 7 second tak mahilaon ke chehre ko ek tak dekhte rahete hai
 The study was conducted by scientists at the University of Manchester
 jisamen unhone 50 purushon ko shaamil kiya
 In this study, it was found that when a woman beautifies her lips with red lipstick, men are not able to remove their eyes from these juicy lips for at least seven seconds, in which she is 0
 95 second mahilaon kii ankhon main dekhne or 0
 85 seconds see their beautiful gulls

 For 2 seconds, he keeps staring at his lips, in which he 2
 97 second mahilaon kii ankhon main hi nihaarne or 2
 77 seconds look at his nose
 to agar aap chaahati hai purushon ko apni ore aakarshith karnaa, to aaj se hi apane raseele or khubasurat honton ko laal rang kii lipstick se or adhik kaamuk banane kii taiyaari main jute jaaen
 Then see the wonder of these red lips

 Under the Samajwadi Party's reconciliation formula, speculation was rife on Amar Singh, but Mulayam's relief in the disproportionate assets case in the Supreme Court proved to be a boon for Amar Singh
 vaise yadav parivaar ke bheetar akhilesh or ramgopal kii jodi lagaataar amar singh par hamalavar rahi, lekin supreme court ne aay se zyada sampatti ke maamle main faisle ke baad mulaayam ko amar kii or jhukaa diya
 Only after this, Mulayam appointed Amar Singh as national general secretary of the Sasamajwadi Party, showing his love
 is puure ghatnakram ke baad 'aaj tak' ne amar singh se khaas baatcheet kii, pesh hai baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:sawaal: aap party mahasachiv bana die gaye hai, kya ye akhilesh or ramgopal ko jhatka he?jawaab:ramgopal mere bhai jaise hai, unase vivaad kaa sawaal hi nahin,akhileshsamajawaadee party kaa bhavishya hai
 i am with all his decisions, Akhilesh too, considers the decision of the SP leader
 isliye netaa ji kaa faisla sar ankhon par
 Question: Will you answer our questions? Will you interview the media? Answer: Look, the socialist family is united, Netaji is the chief, everyone accepts his decision
 unhone faisla kiya he jiske baad meraa kartavya sirf itnaa he ki main netaji ke dil main rahane ke liye har ladaai laduun kyonki netaji ne kaha tha ki amar singh mere dil main rahete hai
 Question: What do you have to say on the inner arrogance of the Samajwadi Party? Answer: The decision of Netaji in our party is the last, is acceptable and i am a socialist, a soft-hearted and a soft-sonist
 isliye netaji kaa faisla sar ankhon par
 Question: When will Amar Singh ji bring the matter of heart to the tongue? Answer: The one who is in my heart, told Vonetaji
 netaji ne faisla kar liya, ab maine tay kiya he ki main chup rahoonga
 Neither i will talk to the media nor i will give an interview because the leader has said that silence is like gold, so today i am liking gold more than silver
