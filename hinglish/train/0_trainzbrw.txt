 It's a sunny Sunday and Gulshan Grover is wearing a salon apron at the Viacom 18 office in Mumbai
 ve haath milakar abhivadan karte he
 Yes, Gulshan Grover has changed handshake into his personal style
 ve tab se tashan se haath milaate hai jab tashan ke bare main koi jaanata bhi nahin tha
 They want you to hear the title song of Badman
 bedman ek mocumentary yaa hansod film he jisamen ve khud apana kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 The film is about his conversation on whatsapp with director Soumik Sen
 aap gane ke bol par acchhee tarah dhyaan de paaen, iske liye grover vahaan ikattha team ke sadasyon par chillaate hai, ''chup raho!'' aisa nahin ki ve bilkul khamoshi chaahate hon

 Everyone agrees to them

 And no one asks the villain his age
 aisa karnaa hero ke mukke se zyada chot pahunchaata he
 Everyone here does not know what Grover is and also that he is one of the earliest actors working in Hollywood
 unki viraasat se nawakif logon main vycom18 ke siio ajit andhaare kii do betiyaan bhi hai
 Andhare is also doing a small role in Badman
 ladkiyaan nahin chaahatin magar grover unke saath ek tasviir utaravaate hai
 Actually when they are not shooting, that is, when they are not recording the moments of mockumentary, this is what Grover does
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''aam taur par log kehete hai ki 'gulshanji, kya aapke saath ek photo khinchvaa sakate hai?'' or yahaan main kah rahaa hum, 'lo photo khincho
 Alok Nath and Baba Sehgal will also be seen on Viacom 18's digital platform Voot and will often entertain people by making them laugh at themselves

 These shows prove that the Internet has become a tool for Bollywood to reach a larger audience and through this he also wants to tell that he can laugh at himself and is the fellow of today's youth

 Golani is confident that future online content will be tested by the 'originality of programs'

 At the JD (U) state headquarters, Yadav said, 'the central government should' roll back 'the decision of FDI in retail trade or discuss the Kamroko proposal of the opposition in Parliament
 is bare main samoochaa vipaksh ekamat he
 He said that during Anna Hazare's agitation for the introduction of Jan Lokpal Bill, the government continued to call Parliament supreme, but when the issue of FDI in retail business came up, it proved itself supreme instead of passing a decision in Parliament
 yah doharaa maapdand kaise chalegaa
 Due to Parliament, such decisions should not be done at the government level
 rajg sanyojak ne kaha ki janamat ke saamne kendra sarkaar ko jhukna hi padegaa, kyonki loksabhaa main is mudde par uske paas aavashyak bahumat nahin he

 It is noteworthy that on the basis of talks with Mukherjee, Mamta had said in Kolkata that the decision of FDI in retail business has been suspended
 unhone kaha ki jab tak is par aam sahmati nahin banati, ise nilambit rakhaa jayega
 Yadav said that on the initiative of Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, it was decided that inflation would first be discussed in the House and after that the issue of black money and corruption would be discussed on the Kamroko proposal of the opposition, but on the same night, the Union Cabinet did not give retail business
 In approving FDI, a new uproar was created, causing Parliament to come to a standstill
 rajg sanyojak ne kaha ki pichley varsh march main ek dhyanaksharn soochna par sarkaar ne mana tha ki khudara vyapaar main epadiai ko ham aam sahmati banaakar lagu karenge, lekin usne is par amal nahin kiya
 Asked whether the BJP had supported FDI in its election manifesto, he said that who reads the election manifesto in the country
 chunki yah maamla aayaa, to aapane kahin se dhundhakar ise pard liya hoga
 Yadav said that there are 25 crore people connected with retail trade in the country and all these will become unemployed with multi-brand FDI

 Should cinema halls be reopened in Kashmir or not? There has been a debate on this on social media
 darasal, mangalvaar ko jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne twit ke jariye saudi arab main cinema haul khole jane kaa swaagat kiya tha
 This has led to a flood of reactions on social media in favor and opposition of the possibility of opening a cinema hall in Kashmir
 kashmir main kisi vakt cinema haul main filmein dekhne kaa khub chalan tha
 Also, cultural activities were also done on a large scale
 saal 1990 se ghati kaa maahaul ashaant hone ke saath hi har tarah ke manoranjan par viraam lag gaya
 The film business suffered the most due to the closure of the cinema hall
 mangalvaar komukhyamantri mahabuuba muftin twit kiya, ‘main saudi arab kii ore se cinema haul par ek dashak puraane pratibandh ko hataane ke faisle kaa swaagat karti hum, jo vahaan ke crown prince kii ore se saamaajik sudhaaron kii kadi ke hisse ke taur par uthaaya gaya he
 Self-observation and self-improvement are the hallmarks of a progressive society
 ’I welcome the decision by Saudi Arabia to lift a decade-long ban on cinemas as part of a series of social reforms by the crown prince
 Introspection & self reform are marks of a progressive society
 — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)december 12, 2017siem mahabuuba ke twit ke samarthan main soshal media par raay rakhane vaale logon ne kaha ki jis tarah sports sector ne yuvaaon ke liye avasaron ke dwaar khole hai, usee tarah cinema haul bhi dobaaraa khulte hai, to wo swaagat yogya hoga
 Critics, however, said that security forces are present in the cinema hall campus
 unhen hataane ke liye pahal koun karegaa? twitor par ek yujar ne sawaal kiya ki ghati main or bhi bahut se mudde he, jin par dhyaan die jane kii jarurat he
 Why is the government focusing on this issue (cinema hall)? Jammu and Kashmir cabinet minister Naeem Akhtar told India Today, “we should open cinema
 samaaj ke logon kii ore se pehla kadam uthaaya jaae
 The government will take responsibility for security
 sarkaar apni ore se dakhal nahin de sakati
 This is a social restriction
 adhiktar log gharon par filmein dekhte hai
 People need entertainment
 nagarikon ke paas parivaar ke saath baahar jane ke liye vajah or vikalp hoga
 Sources say that the government currently has no plans to reopen the cinema hall
 haalanki is prastaav ko lekar jo samooh bhi dilchaspee dikhaa rahe hai, sarkaar unhen sakaaratmak rukh dikhaa rahi he
 Once upon a time, many people used to come to Srinagar to watch Bollywood movies in Neelam and Palladium, but all changed during the period of unrest
 ye donon cinema haul suraksha balon ke camp main tabdeel ho gaye
 Where once there were queues to watch new movies of the cinema people, now these cinema halls see barbed wire fences and teen sheds
 saal 1999 main reagal cinema ko dobaaraa shuru karne kii koshish hui thi, lekin is cinema par aatankiyon ne hathgolon se hamalaa kiya
 Since then there has never been an attempt to re-open Regal

 Even if the enemy gets a ticket, but win it
 "iske baad digvijay ne jo bolaa usne congress main lagaataar ho rahi unki upeksha ko bayaan kar gaya

 com / yuhmmvo6er - Rohit Sardana (@sardanarohit) October 15, 2018 This is the cause of pain
 Actually, there are many reasons behind the pain of Digvijay Singh
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi jab bhopal aae to road sho or bhel dashahra maidan main raily sthal par unke katout nadaarad dikhaai die
 While the pictures and hoardings of all the Congress leaders were visible in the entire city, the party's factionalism was also visible due to the absence of hoardings of Digvijay Singh
 haalanki iske liye baad main congress pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath ne unase maafee maangi thi
 But other Congress leaders themselves believe that there is a conspiracy against Digvijay Singh in the Congress itself
 congress ke varisht netaa maanak agarwal ne kaha ki postaron se digvijay singh kaa gaayab hona unke khilaaf sajeesh thi
 If Manak Agarwal is to be believed then the complaint has also gone to the Congress High Command

 The news of Vijay Mallya's arrest in London suddenly came on Tuesday evening and after a while the news of bail also came
 iske baad maalya ne twit kiya or bhartiya media par hi nishaanaa saadhaa
 After this, people started raising questions on social media whether the government will be able to bring Mallya back to India
 sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki kisi ko bhi bakhsha nahin jayega or abhi prakriya to puri hone dijie
 Difficult but possible
 jaanate hai aakhir ve koun se kadam hai jinke jariye 9000 karod rupee ke lone difolt cese main aaropee maalya ko waapas bharat laayaa jayega?pratyrpan ke 9 charnon main se ye pehlabritain ke saath bharat kaa pratyrpan sandhi he
 The extradition proceedings against Mallya started with Tuesday's case but this is only the first phase of the 9 extradition phase
 maalya ko apil karne ke 3 maukey milenge
 What is indo-uk extradition treaty? India and Britain had an extradition treaty in 1993
 iske tahat donon deshon ke bich vaanchit logon ko pratyrpit karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 There are several cases against Mallya including money laundering, loan default
 bharat sarkaar ne british ucchayog ke jariye maalya ke pratyrpan kaa anurodh bheja tha
 How will the decision on extradition? According to the British government, Britain maintains an extradition treaty with around 100 countries of the world under multinational conventions and bilateral treaties
 inamen bharat category 2 ke tip bi vaale deshon main shaamil he
 The UK is decided by the Foreign Ministry and the courts on the request from the countries involved in the category in which India is
 prakriya kaaphi lambiipratyrpan kii prakriya kaaphi lambii he
 - Foreign Minister will be requested, who decides whether to certify it or not
 -jaj nirnay karata he ki giraftaar ke liye warrant jari kiya jaae yaa nahin
 It will be followed by an initial hearing
 -phir baari aegi pratyrpan sunwaayee kii
 The Foreign Ministry then decides whether to order extradition or not
 -aagrah karne vaale desh ko crown prosicution sarvice ko aagrah kaa shuruaati masauda saunpane ke liye kaha jaataa he, taaki baad main koi dikkat pesh naa aae
 - First the British Home Ministry's International Criminality Unit considers this request
 agar durust paaya jaataa he, to ise aagrah adaalat ko badha diya jaataa he
 -if the court agrees that an arrest warrant will be issued if sufficient information has been made available
 isamen vyakti vishesh se judi sari jaankaree hoti he
 The arrest is followed by an initial hearing and an extradition hearing
 sunwaayee puri hone ke baad jaj santusht hota he to maamle ko videsh mantralay ko badha diya jaataa he
 Despite this, the person whose extradition is being negotiated can appeal the judge's decision to send the case to the Ministry of External Affairs
 -maamle par vichaar ke baad videsh mantralay faisla letaa he
 There are three circumstances in which extradition cannot be done: If there is a fear of coming to judgment against the person after extradition, if there is any special arrangement with the country of solicitation, if the person If extradited to Britain from a third country
 khaas baat ye he ki videsh mantralay ko maamla bhejne ke do maheene ke bheetar faisla karnaa hota he
 If it is not so, the person can apply for release
 haalanki videsh mantri adaalat se faisla dene kii taarikh aage badwa saktaa he
 Even after this entire process, the person has the right to appeal in the High Court and the Supreme Court

 After bail, Mallya got angry with the Indian media and said that apart from Mallya, these four people also planted the country with thousands of crores
 The Government of India had asked Britain in May last year to return Mallya as his passport has been canceled
 british sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki unke yahaan rahane ke liye kisi ke paas vaid passport hona jaruri nahin, lekin kyonki maalya ke khilaaf gambhir aarope he, isliye unke pratyrpan par vichaar kiya jayega
 What is the information known? Senior advocate KTS Tulsi says that Mallya's extradition may take several years
 ye is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki bharat sarkaar kis tarah ke dastavej british sarkaar ke saamne pesh karti he
 Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan says that the government should also initiate extradition proceedings against Lalit Modi

 yuvakon dwaara ashleel ms ko saarvajanik karne kii dhamkee dekar beete do maah se yuvati ko blackmel kiya ja rahaa tha
 According to police sources, on the complaint of the girl's family, the Betul Kotwali police arrested four youths by registering a case against the accused for blackmailing the girl by making obscene MMS, while the police is actively searching for five other accused
 police kaa maananaa he ki aropiyon ne iske purv bhi yuvatiyon ke ashleel ms banaakar unhen blackmel kiya hoga
 The cases did not come to light after the victim did not complain, but in the latest case, the accused were arrested after the victim's family complained to the police
 sutron ke anusaar baitool nivasee ek yuvati kaa vivaah maharashtra main hua tha
 In May 2011, the girl was in her maternal home
 police ke mutabik 10 may, 2011 ko yuvati apane rishtedaar ke saath baitool ke sameep sthit sonaghati ghoomane gai thi, jahaan 8-9 yuvakon ne donon ke saath marpet kii or unhen forest nursery ke paas le gaye
 The youth intimidated the young woman and made a video of her from mobile and started blackmailing her by demanding Rs 20,000 for threatening to make pornographic MMS public

 aise main bijepi kisi khaas jati samudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale kisiek netaa ko party kaa phase nahin bananaa chaahati he
 Therefore, it is not necessary that the party comes out with a face before the election
 sabhi jati samikarnon par khara utarane vaala cheharaa nahiparty ke paas abhi uttar pradesh main rajnath singh, yogi adityanath,varun gandhiore keshav prasad maury jaise naam hai
 But the leaders of the party believe that none of these leaders can make a dent in all the castes
 kuch netaaon kaa naam jarur bada he lekin ground reality ke hisaab se party aage badhegi
 Of course all these names are going on in the media, but the party has not yet taken any final decision in this direction that the party will go to the elections with the help of face
 piem modi kaa cheharaa sabase badaparty leadership ko lagata he kipradhanmantri narendra modika phase hi sabase bada phase he, jiske sahare upi main vah chunaav jeetenge
 At the same time, BJP is fully engaged to keep pace with the caste equations there

 BJP leaders believe that if Swami Prasad Maurya comes out of the BSP, he may or may not benefit, but the BSP will definitely suffer and the BJP will benefit from it
 haalanki swami prasad maury ko bijepi apane paale main laana chaahati he
 Some BJP leaders have met Maurya many times but the final decision has not been made when he comes to the party

 Madhya Pradesh alleges that despite being overflowing, Rajasthan is not releasing its share of water from the Gandhi Sagar Dam, due to which the crops of the farmers of Chambal region are drying up
 lekin rajasthan is aarope ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 It says that Madhya Pradesh has not raised this issue on any platform before it

 Pancham Singh, 40, a farmer from Holapura village in Morena district, says, "the crop of wheat is affected every year due to lack of water in the canal
 ''saath ke dashak main hue ek samjhaute ke mutabik madhya pradesh or rajasthan ko chambal nadi par bane baandhon kaa 50-50 fisadi pani milanaa chahie
 But Madhya Pradesh never got all the water

 Officials of the two states met in December last year regarding the sharing of water, but the dispute was not resolved

 After spending, he has laid a network of canals in Chambal region so that water can be available to the farmers and the crop can also be full

 He says, "there is no injustice happening to Madhya Pradesh
" ham unhen puraa pani de rahe hai
 Madhya Pradesh did not raise any such case in the high level meeting held in Delhi in December

 Input: IANS gujarat main pehle charan ke liye 19 jilon kii 89 siton ke liye voting honi he
 The BJP may be pushing for high-tech campaigning in the elections, but BJP President Amit Shah is relying most heavily on Panna Pramukh, the strongest link in his election strategy, to win the election

 But it had no effect on the election results and the BJP lost in Delhi

 India a coach Rahul Dravid respects the Supreme Court verdict in the recent spot-fixing case but has sympathy for the players affected by the verdict
 court ke faisle kaa sammaan hona chahiebharat ke purv captain ne kaha ki chennai super kings or rajasthan royles ko ipel se do saal ke liye baahar karne ke justise lodha samiti ke faisle se yuva khiladiyon par asar padegaa lekin ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara niyukt samiti ke faisle kaa sammaan kiya janaa chaiye
 It is disappointing, said Hedravid, 'it is disappointing that at times the antics of one or two persons affect so many people
 in halaat main pyramid main sabase neeche maujuud logon par sabase zyada asar padataa he
 Top players and coaches always get work
 hamaari team ke sheersh khiladiyon ko duusari tiimon main jagah mil jaayegi
 "young players will be impacted" Dravid said in the press conference before the series against Australia A, "it is unfortunate that it will have an impact on young players
" unke liye niraashaa he lekin faisle kaa sammaan karnaa hoga kyonki ucchtam nyaayalay ke paas adhik jaankaree thi or unhone is par bahut sochaa hoga
 People should decide whether it is a blot or not, when asked if it is a blot on their career, Dravid said that it is up to the people to decide
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki yah logon ko tay karnaa he ki kya yah dhabba tha
 i do not want to defend myself
 meri bhoomika menter or coach kii thi
 People have to decide what should be connected with the coaches and mentors to the antics of owners and shareholders
 main sirf itnaa kahana chahta hum ki hamen ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 'it is not my business to decide whether it was a tough decision, Dravid said,' It is not my job to decide whether the decision was harsh or not
 yah team, khiladiyon or lig ke liye kathin faisla he lekin hamen iskaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 There are people who have no fault and who are very good but they will be affected by this decision
 main nahin jaanata ki team kaa bhavishya kya hoga kyonki main na to sanchaalan parishad kaa hissaa hum or na hi bisisiai se judaa hum
 You did not know about the fixing
 Let me tell you that two years ago, three players of Rajasthan Royals were found guilty of spot fixing
 us samay team ke menter rahe dravid ne kaha ki coach ke liye yah pataa karnaa bahut mushkil hota he ki koun bhrashtachar main lipt he
 Dravid said, 'I did not know that these three players are doing something suspicious
 yadi mujhe pataa hota to main usase nipatata
 i had no doubt and i have spoken clearly about this to the Mudgal Committee
 pataa karnaa mushkil ki koun galat haiunhone kaha, 'ek team main hote hue bhi yah pataa karnaa mushkil hota he ki koi spot phixing main shaamil he yaa nahin
 If i start doubting every wide hair or fours, then love and interest in the game will end
 main isaliye har match yaa team main chauke chakke lagane par khiladiyon par shaq nahin karata
 Dravid said that it is necessary to be vigilant to avoid duplication of such incidents in future
 unhone kaha, 'aise masale aane par cricket kii chhavi par dhabba lagata he
 It is sad for all the people associated with Indian cricket
 hamen hameshaa satark rahanaa hoga
 Despite this decision, there are people who will try to harm cricket, we have to be vigilant

 Since 2003, Shashibala and Vijayalakshmi, who visit the Kalkaji temple every time, have got a share from their brother only when they turned to the court and ordered the court themselves
 lekin abhi tak pujari bhai ne mandir me seva ke adhikaar se bahanon ko dur hi rakhaa he
 No female priest has ever been made in the history of the Kalkaji temple
 shashibala ne kaha ki bhai satyadev kaa vyavhaar behad kharaab he
 His people are sitting everywhere in the temple
 hamen to wo mandir kii sidhiyon par bhi nahin chadhane dete

 They have no other source of income

 The verdict may come on Friday, the rise in Kalkaji in the court will also raise questions on the ashes of the temple
 hai court main buudhvaar ko hui sunwaayee main court ne ye tak kah diya ki agar chadhaave ke bantwaare ko lekar itani pareshaani he to kyon na kalkaji mandir ko vaishno devi trust yaa aise hi kisi or trust ko saunp diya jaae
 The Delhi High Court had asked the counsel of the Kalkaji priest that why women cannot worship and serve in temples? The High Court can pronounce a decision in this matter on Friday

 In 2017, the central government brought the FRDI bill to bail out the banking sector from the problem of NPA
 is bill ko kendra sarkaar ne waapas le liya he
 This decision has brought relief to crores of bank account holders in the country
 yah echardiai bill desh ke sarkari or privet bainkon ko sankat se oobaarane ke liye bainkon ko aisi shaktiyaan detaa jiskaa sidhaa asar karodon bank khataadharakon par padataa
 What is the FRDI Bill? With the FRDI bill proposed by the government, the government wanted to resolve all financial institutions like banks, insurance companies and other financial organizations under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
 is bill ko kanoon banaakar kendra sarkaar biimaar padi vittiya companiyon ko sankat se ubaarane kii koshish karti
 The need for this bill was felt after the financial crisis of 2008 when many high-profile bankruptcies were seen
 iske baad se kendra sarkaar ne jandhan yojana or notebandi jaise faislon se lagaataar koshish kii he ki zyada se zyada log banking vyavastha ke daayre main rahen
 Due to this, it becomes very important that those who have joined the banking system have a guarantee of their money security in the event of the bank or financial institution sinking
 ise padhein: kendra sarkaar ke mutabik FRDI kanoon se or surakshit ho jayega bank main jamaa aapkaa paisaechardiai bill kaa pramukh praavdhanis bill main ek rejolution corporation banane kii baat thi
 This corporation would be replaced by Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
 yah rejolution corporation vittiya sansthaaon ke swasthya kii nigaraanee karata or unke doobane kii sthiti main use bachaane kaa prayaas karata
 At the same time, when the financial institution is set to sink, in such a situation, this corporation had to solve their financial liability
 gauratlab he ki rejolution corporation kaa ek ahm kaam graahakon ko diposit insurance dene kaa bhi he haalanki abhi is insurance kii seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he
 Why is it afraid of the FRDI bill? Through the FRDI bill, the resolution corporation also has the right to take (bail in) steps to rescue the failing entity
 jahaan bel out ke jariye sarkaar janata ke paise ko sust padi arthvyavastha main nivesh karti he jisase use ubaara ja sake vahiin bel in ke jariye bank graahakon ke paise se sankat main pade bank ko ubaarane kaa kaam kiya jaataa he
 Read this: NPA becomes a burden, the government's lost sweat in improving the health of the banks, the crisis on bank balance, due to this provision of the FRDI bill, the common people were afraid that if their bank fails then they may have to lose their hard earned money
 is
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda praavdhaan ke mutabik kisi bank ke doobane kii sthiti main graahak ko uske khate main jamaa kul rakam main mahaj 1 lakh rupee kii guarantee rahati he or baaki paisa lautaane ke liye bank baadhya nahin rahete
 The government has not yet taken any decision on this amount of guarantee in the proposed FRDI bill
 kendra sarkaar ne prastaavit financial rejolution and diposit insurance bill 2017(echardiai bill) par safai di thi ki sansad main pesh kiye gaye bill main bank graahakon ke liye maujuuda suraksha praavdhaanon main kisi tarah ke aise badlaav kii peshkash nahin kii he jisase unke hiton ko nuksaan pahunche
 Apart from this, the Central Government had also claimed that through the proposals in the bill introduced in Parliament, efforts will be made to provide extra security to the customers as well as bring more transparency in the banking sector
 gauratlab he ki echardiai bill ko sansad main pesh karne ke baad kendra sarkaar ne safai di thi ki echardiai bill main kiye gaye bel-in praavdhaanon se bank ke graahakon kii jamaa rakam par khatra nahin aayega
 The Central Government had sent the FRDI bill presented in the Lok Sabha on 11 August 2017 for consideration of the Joint Committee of Parliament, terming it as an error
 lihaaja sansadeey joint samiti ne is bill par sabhi hitdharakon se raay lee
 The joint committee also tried to find out how the safety norms of banks' health and bank customers could be strengthened
 kendra sarkaar ke mutabik maujuuda samay main bank ke prayek graahak ko 1 lakh rupee tak ke diposit ko diposit insurance and credit guarantee corporation ke tahat suraksha di jaati he
 On the other hand, deposits above Rs 1 lakh are not given any security and are considered equivalent to the claims of the unsecured lender
 lihaaja, prastaavit bill main kendra sarkaar ne maujuuda suraksha dene ke saath-saath asurakshit paise ke bhi suraksha maandand ko badhaane kii peshkash kii thi
 The central government claims that the FRDI bill has been prepared keeping in mind the interests of bank customers, while elsewhere, the bail-in provisions do not provide for the approval of creditors and depositors
 vahiin prastaavit kanoon main sarkari bainko samet sabhi bainkon ke financingh or rejolution kii sarkaar kii shaktiyon main bhi kisi katautee kaa prastaav nahi kiya gaya he

 Whatever time it takes to put Masood Azhar, the leader of terrorist group jaish-e-mohammed, on the list of global terrorists, India is ready to exercise restraint with China but will not compromise on its position on terrorism
 aadhikarik sutron ne shanivaar ko yah jaankaree di
 The statement came from India after China blocked the announcement of the Jaish chief as a global terrorist
 bharat sarkaarase jude sutron ne kaha ki aise kai mudde hai jinhen china ko pakistan ke saath sulajhane kii jarurat he kyonki pakistan kii bhoomi par aatankwaadiyon ke sakriy hone ke paryaapt saboot hai jo china ke bhi hit main nahin he
 He said that China should resolve these issues with Pakistan and India will exercise restraint on it
 bharat ne china sahit sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke sabhi sadsy deshon ke saath ajahar ke khilaaf saboot saajha kiye hai
 It should be noted that on Wednesday, China once again technically banned jaish-e-mohammad's proposal to ban the kingpin
 bharat ne china ke is kadam ko niraashajanak qaraar diya tha
 According to sources, India is cautiously confident that Azhar will be included in the global list of terrorists as there is a strong case against the jaish-e-mohammed leader
 sutron ne kaha ki bharat ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne main sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad yaa sanyukt raashtra kii pratibandh samiti ke saath naa koi samjhauta karegaa or naa hi koi samjhauta khatm karegaa
 New Delhi is ready to wait a long time on the issue
 unhone kaha ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) ke 15 main se 14 sadasyon ne bharat kaa is mudde par samarthan kiya he jabaki saat sadsy ajahar ko soochibaddh karne ke prastaav ko sah-pryojit kar rahe hai
 India will continue its fight until it is banned by the United Nations
 france, britain or america ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke 1267 al kaayda pratibandh samiti ke tahat ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne kaa taaja prastaav pesh kiya tha
 The proposal was brought after 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir
 jaish-e-mohammad ne pulavama hamale kii jimmedaari lee thi
 Sources said that terrorism is an issue on which India cannot compromise, if China needs time, then New Delhi is ready for it
 unhone kaha ki bharat ajahar ke mudde par sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kaa rukh nahin karegaa or agar ajahar ko soochibaddh karne kaa koi anya rasta he to vah shaktishaalee sanghathan ke sadasyon ko uskaa pataa lagaana hoga
 He also ruled out any other country becoming an arbitrator between India and Pakistan on the matter
 sutron ne kaha ki bharat, pakistan dwaara apni jameen se sanchalit hone vaale aatanki samoohon ke khilaaf uski karrwai ke sandarbh main vittiya kaary bal (efeetief) kii kaaryayojna ke anupaalan par kadi najar rakhega
 Significantly, China has stopped the proposal to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist for the fourth time in the last 10 years

 lekin phir bhi kuch aisi galtiyaan hai jo purush genes pahante vakt aksar karte hai
 1
 purush crop genes pahante vakt aksar uski lambaai ke saath gadabadi karte hai
 The length of crop jeans should be equal to or below the ankle
 purushon kii genes kii lambaai kaa khaas dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Ranbir's sister gave Sonam this gift 2
 purush halke or dark color kii genes ke saath bhi bahut gadabad karte hai
 Dark shade jeans should be worn in the evening or at night
 halke shed vaali genes ko din main pahanane se hamaara dressing sens kaaphi shandaar dikhataa he
 But men keep making such mistakes with the shed of jeans
 kyon hoti he pipal ke ped kii puja, kya he khaas mahatv3
 Due to the long running of men's jeans, they often gather on top of shoes, which is very bad to see
 agar aapaki genes ke saath aisa hota he to aapako uski lambaai kam kara leni chahie
 By doing this, the jeans will look good and its fitting will also be good

 Everyone wants to wear their fitting jeans whether it is a man or woman
 lekin sharir se mote purushon ko slim feet kii genes nahin pahanani chahie
 Such men should avoid wearing slim fit jeans
 slim feet genes pahanane se wo aakarshak nahin dikhte
