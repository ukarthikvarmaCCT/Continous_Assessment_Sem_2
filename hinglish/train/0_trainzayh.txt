 Asus ne haal hi main bhartiya bazaar main ek bajet smartphone zenfone Live launch kiya he
 The company claims that it is the first smartphone in the world to have inbuilt beautification feature for live videos
 aisa lagata he jaise is smartphone ko isli launch kiya gaya he kyonki company iske divaais ke jariye live butification fitures laana chaahati thi
 During the review, we found that this smartphone has been launched only because the company has given live beautification in it
 isaki sabase badi khaasiyaton main se ek yah he ki yah chota or halkaa he
 zenfone Live Review till date zenfone Live's body is made of plastic and if you want to use a small screen smartphone then this is a better smartphone for this
 metal finnish vaale is smartphone ko dur se dekhakar koi bhi dhokhaa kha saktaa he ki yah metal smartphone he
 Despite the lack of metal unibody, its build quality is superb
 ek haath se yuj karne ke liye to yah jabardast he
 These days most companies are launching big screen smartphones, so some people will definitely like this device of Asus
 yah chota hone ke saath saath patala bhi he, isliye acchhee feel detaa he
 The speaker grill is at the bottom of the phone while the antenna band is at the top
 displexendone Live main 5 inch kii 2
 The 5D curved display is given which is really bright and its touch is also excellent
 aapako yuj karne main majaa aayega
 The screen resolution is HD and the screen size is low, so it looks much better
 camera departmentphotography ke liye isamen 13 megapixl kaa rier picksal master camera diya gaya jiskaa aparchar f / 2

 a 5 megapixel front camera with 4 micron pixels sensor has been given
 iskaa aparchar f / 2
 2 and it has a soft lit LED flash
 aapako bataa den ki isamen laga lens 82 degree wide angel he
 The selfie camera of this smartphone has impressed us
 khaskar isamen die jane vaale butification fitures real time live ke liye is segment ke hisaab se kaaphi bahatar hai
 Although the selfie clicked with beautification features makes the faces look strange, machine-like
 haalanki agar aap heavi yujar hai yani smartphone main gaming karte hai, filmein dekhte hai or zyada spes vaale ap yuj karte hai to shaayad yah smartphone aapako niraash kare
 Because the specification given in it is mid range only
 live butification ficharkampany ne launch ke dauraan is feechar ko kaaphi pramukhataa di, lekin kya sach main yah khaas he? agar soshal media par live jane kii aadat he aapako, na sirf fasebuk balki utyub or instagram par bhi aap lagaataar live jate hai to is smartphone main aapke liye kai chijen khaas hai
 Usually, you cannot experiment with your face much when live streaming
 lekin isamen die gaye feechar yani real time butification feechar se skin tone badal sakate hai
 But they look artificial

 It has a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad core processor, which is almost four years old, with a speed of 1
 5ghz he
 Its internal memory is 16GB which can be increased to 256GB via micro SD
 spacification damdaar na hone kii vajah se parformens ke maamle main is smartphone ne hamen kaaphi niraash kiya he
 It takes a lot of effort to run heavy apps and multitasking is quite troublesome
 itnaa hi nahin isamen android ke puraane varjan marshmelo besd zenui par chalata he
 However, there are definitely many small work features that you may like
 lekin overol parformens ke maamle main yah smartphone niraash karata he
 Battery This smartphone has a 2,650mah battery which has impressed us a lot
 mixd yuj karke ise puure din aaraam se chalaaya ja saktaa he jiske baad bhi isamen kuch bydaree bachi rahegi
 Overall, according to this segment, this zenfone LIVE did not impress us
 haalanki hamane jaisaa upar bataaya he isamen kai khaasiyaten bhi hai, lekin isamen kuch chizon kaa na hone ise bazaar main peeche kar saktaa he
 Apart from the fingerprint scanner, the metal body, new version of Android and new processor would have been something else

 The BJP has hit back at the Congress amidst the continuing political turmoil in Karnataka
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne buudhvaar raat kaha ki congress samvidhan kaa paath na padhaaye
 How did the Congress protect the constitution by imposing emergency in the country, so it should not cry before the BJP

 Ravi Shankar Prasad, citing two commissions, said that in the Bommai case it has been said that if a CM loses his majority, he will have to bring the majority to the House through a trust vote
 bomai maamle se pataa chalata he ki chunaav ke baad sarkaar banane ke liye kise aamantrit karnaa he, yah rajyapal ke vivek par nirbhar karata he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that three things have become clear in the Sarkaria Commission
 isse saaf ho jaataa he ki rajyapal ko kisi party ko pehle sarkaar gathan ke liye bulaanaa hota he
 According to the recommendation of the Commission, the Governor can call the pre-election coalition to form the government first
 doosraa, chunaav main jo sabase badi party hoti he, rajyapal ko use sarkaar gathan ke liye aamantrit karnaa hota he
 According to the subsequent order, the Governor has been invited to invite the coalition after the election to form the government

 Read the opportunity to get the job of Manager in Vacancy NBCC for the post of Project Assistant in JOB ALERTCBRI as on 30 April Apply for Engineer Recruitment in India Electronics Limited for Junior Clerk and Stenographer in Vacancy MPEDA at Navali Lignite Corporation bhartiya janata party main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jo gata tha vaisaa hi aam aadmi party main dilli chunaav ke baad hua
 The only difference was that Advani's tears, the frustrations of Sushma Swaraj, the marginalized migration of senior leaders were decent and gracious while in the Aam Aadmi Party it was in a rough and devious manner, which was like the Chhathaiya politics in the street
 phir bhi bhaajapa or aap main yah ekarupata itani phikr paidaa nahin karti jitani niraashaa is par hoti he ki bharat main nai gavarnence or nai raajnneeti kii ummiden itani jaldi murjhaa rahi hai or donon ke kaaran ek jaise hai
 Narendra Modi emerged with dominant politics in the BJP, so he could not adequately incorporate his own party's experiences in the government which was necessary for far-reaching changes in governance, as a result his powerful government could not be weighty and effective
 duusari taraf arvind kejariwal ne satta main pahunchate hi samaveshi raajnneeti kii puunji ganvaa di, jo unhen auron se alag karti thi
 The disintegration of the Aam Aadmi Party is a more far-reaching phenomenon than a split in a traditional political party
 yah party us eent gaare se banati nahin dikhi thi jisase anya rajnatik dal bane hai
 Beliefs on family, person, identity or thought are the foundation of India's traditional party politics, which may keep the parties conservative but solidarity remains on their side
 kejariwal ke paas aisi koi pahchaan nahin he
 His 49-day poor governance was forgotten because the Aam Aadmi Party was creating a new politics related to participation, transparency and land, which many people wanted to try
 'aap' kaa prahasan dekhne ke baad yah kahana mushkil he ki iske agua netaaon main mahatvakankshaayen nahin thim yaa is party main duusare dalon jaisi hikeman samskruti nahin he
 However, when you are climbing and screaming on top of the ideal, you should also devise an idealistic way of handling political disagreements
 kejariwal kii party asahmati ke ek chote jatke main hi chauraahey par aa gai jabaki paaramparik dal isse zyada bade vivaadon ko kaayade se sambhalate rahe hai
 Delhi's victory suggests that Kejriwal may have prepared for governance but not an ideal party politics that is essential for better governance
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par log kejariwal kii simaaen jaanate hai, alabatta nai raajnneeti ke avishkaarak ke taur par unase apekshaaon kii fehrist bahut lambii thi
 Kejriwal has five years
 ve dilli ko thik-thaak gavarnence de sakate hai lekin ve acchhee raajnneeti dene kaa mauka chook gaye hai
 On the political scale, the Aam Aadmi Party has now become like SP, BJD, Trinamool, DMK which are limited to one state
 is nae prayog ke rashtriya vistaar kii sambhaavnaaon par andeh karnaa jaij he
 Kejriwal's supporters, like today Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan are proving to be unnecessary and burdensome for the party, similarly Narendra Modi's supporters were dismissing the party's older generation at a time when the Modi era in bjp's national politics Was beginning nau maah main modi kii lokapriyata main jabardast giravat (india today vishesh janamat surveykshan) dekhte hue yah mahasoos karnaa mushkil nahin he ki gavarnence main modi kii vifaltaaen bhi shaayad unke raajnneeti ke model se nikali hai jo hikeman samskruti or party main asahmati rakhane waalon ko vanprastha dene ke maamle main congress se zyada talkh or do took sabit hua
 Despite Modi's resolve and goodwill as Prime Minister, if his government looks like a normal government within a year, there are two reasons
 ek-modi ke netritv main bijepi ne gavarnence ke liye koi taiyaari nahin kii thi or do-vishaal bahumat ke baavjood ek prabhavi sarkaar aakaar nahin le saki
 The BJP could not even create the vision document of its government before the election
 ghoshnaa patr to matdaan shuru hone ke baad aayaa
 These things have come up in the heat of the election, but the truth is that the BJP came to power without a visionary model of new governance because the work of building governance was not done and the people who were doing so were marginalized
 
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne jab faisle liye to ve chunavi sankalpon se alag dikhe yaa pichhali sarkaar ko doharaate najar aae
 Even after almost a year of coming to power, if Modi is not able to create a strong experienced and talented government which raises confidence to change the chemistry of the governance of this huge country, then perhaps this is also due to his political form
 modi centre main gujarat jaisi gavarnence laana chaahate the par darasal ve bijepi ko chalaane kaa gujarati model party kii rashtriya raajnneeti main le aae, jo sabko saath lekar chalane main yakeen hi nahin karata yaa ausat team se khilne ko bahaduree maanata he
 Not only the first year of the previous NDA government, but the entire tenure was full of visionary decisions
 vipareet maahaul or gathjod kii sarkaar main atal bihari vaajapeyi itnaa kuch isliye kar sake kyonki unke paas gavarnence kaa spasht road map tha or unhen sabko sahejane, sabakaa sarvshereshth saamne laane kii kala aati thi
 Politics and governance are deeply intertwined
 modi or kejariwal is antarasambandh ko kaayade se saadh nahin sake
 Now both of them stand on the same ground of reality
 apekshaaon kaa jowar neeche aayaa he
 Attempts to make leaders superhuman and messiahs have come to an end

 The beginning of governments is very valuable because there is not much time to show taxes

 This will be considered as a historic decision through which the three judges have unanimously held that the idol should be placed at the place where the idol of Ramlala is seated and that the place should be given to the Hindus
 haalanki ramajnmabhumi vivaad par teenon jaj ek mat nahin thea
 According to Justice SU Khan, it was the recognition of Hindus that prevailed a few decades before 1949 that where the idol of Ramlala is enshrined there is Ramjanmabhoomi
 isaki koi pukhta saboot nahin he aisa justise khan kaa maananaa he
 Jatis Khan has also said that the disputed structure was built as a mosque according to Babur's orders
 lekin kisi mandir ko todakar masjid nahin banaaya gaya
 However, evidence has been found that there were remains of the temple in the dilapidated condition at that place and some of the remains of the temple may have been used in the construction of the mosque
 lekin donon paksh chaahe hindu hon yaa musalmaan yah sabit nahin kar saken ki vivaddit jameen par malikana haq kiskaa he
 In the opinion of Justice Agarwal, Ramjanm is the place where the idol sits
 haalanki justise khan or justise agarwal is baat par ekamat hai ki vivaadit ramajanm bhoomi sthal ke teen hisse hone chahie
 In which a part of Hindus where Ramlala is sitting in the present situation
 sita rasoi or rama chabutara nirmohi akhaada ke dekharekh main rahe or musalamaanon ko puja karne ke liye is kshetra kaa kamase kam ek tihaai hissaa jarur diya janaa chahie
 There is no scope for controversy after this decision

 According to sources, the entire scam is related to the steel scrap and iron business

 There has been no significant progress in India's manufacturing sector in the last five years

 i would be better off working in an NGO

 bhartiya parampara he ki subah snaan ke baad surya ko jal chadhaakar hi bhojan kiya jaataa he
 You will be surprised to know that science has also enumerated its many benefits
 aap bhi jaaniye inhen
 
 
 The benefits of offering water to the sun have a tradition of offering water to religious logic
 shastron ke anusaar suryadev ko jal chadhaane se suryadev prasann hote hai
 Sun does not rage on humans
 saath hi uske raashi dosha khatm ho jate hai
 Do you know why oil is offered to Shani Dev? During the sunrise of scientific reasoning, the rays of the sun are not very strong, which act as a medicine for the body
 ugte surya ko jal chadhaate vakt jal kii dhar main surya dikhaai detaa he
 The rays of the sun filter through the water and fall on the eyes and body
 jisase ankhon kii roshni tej hoti he
 This reduces the risk of jaundice, tuberculosis and heart diseases
 surya kii kirnon se vitamin-di bhi miltaa he
 By adding water to the sun in the morning, pure oxygen is also provided
 vahiin snaan ke baad bhojan ko dharmik nazariye se ahm mana gaya he
 This tradition is also centuries old
 shanidev ke bare main jaane ye 7 baaten, khulegaa bhagyasnan ke baad hi bhojan karnadharmik tarkshastron ke anusaar bina snaan kiye bhojan karnaa varjit he
 According to the scriptures, after bathing, one should eat after being pure
 bina snaan kiye bhojan karnaa pashuon ke samaan he ise apavitra mana gaya he
 By doing this the Gods and Goddesses are unhappy
 ramajaan main khul jate hai jananath ke daravaaje, har dua hoti he kubulavaigyanik tarkvaigyanik drushtikon se snaan karne se sharir kii gandagee nikal jaati he sharir main nai taazgi or sphurti aati he
 After taking bath naturally feel hungry
 us samay bhojan karne se bhojan kaa ras sharir ke liye pushtiverdhak hota he

 i-mitra kiyosk (booth) kaa shater upar karte hi darjanabhar logon kii qatari lag gai
 They have the necessary documents for making Aadhaar card, Bhamashah and ration card in their hands
 aadhaar card banavaane ke liye apane dastavej saunpte hue dabda gaanv kii manju puuchhati hai, “card kab tak banakar aayega?” kiyosk sanchaalak sivakumar sharma kaa jawaab he, “banate hi aapke mobile main massej aa jayega or hafte bhar main ghar tak pahunch jayega
 "the Aadhaar card, which was not available for the first six months, has started coming up in ten days
 line main lagi kaushalya devi ko rashan card banane ke liye bhi itane hi din kaa hawala diya gaya
 Regarding the functioning of the kiosk, Sharma explains, "after getting the necessary documents, it does not take much time for further processing
 ”yahi vajah he ki kabhi viraan pade rahane vaale i-mitra kiyosk ab aabaad ho gaye hai
 Alam is that through kiosks in the state, only 81 million jobs of 163 government services were done last September
 pichley chaar maheene kaa record dekhen to log i-mitra kii sevaaon se lagaataar jud rahe hai
 People have taken 36 lakh services in June, 46 lakhs in July, 58 lakhs in August

 e-mitra scheme was launched in 2004 in Rajasthan to make government schemes and services accessible to the public online
 iske tahat i-mitra kiyosk sthapit hue
 Initially the plan was quite sluggish as they did not have large services nor did the people find the e-mitra kiosks reliable
 isliye ye fail ho rahe the
 The Vasundhara Raje government rapidly expanded services on e-mitra after coming to power
 philhal janata ko i-mitra ke marfat 225 sevaayen mil rahi hai
 There are plans to add banking services as well
 sarkaar ne 42 companiyon se pradesh main i-mitra kiyosk lagane kaa qaraar kar rakhaa he
 There are 33,391 kiosks operating through these companies
 shahari kshetra main inaki sankhya kareeb 10,000 or gramin kshetra main 23,000 hai
 Of these, 8,000 are running in Atal Seva Kendras and the rest in private places

 Says Sharma, “people are seeing tremendous engagement with e-mitra
 abhi data online kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 After that the work will be done in a pinch
 ”sarkaar ne kaam ke badale kiyosk ke liye kamishan tay kar rakhaa he
 Private companies are scheduled to get 25 per cent commission and kiosks 75 per cent
 bijli, pani or telephone ke bill jaisi nickshulk sevaaon kaa kamishan sambandhit vibhaag detaa he
 30 for the rest of the services like ration card
 , mul nivas pramaan or jati pramaan patr ke liye 15 ru
 , 15 for Aadhaar enrollment
 , bijli-pani ke conection ke aavedan ke 50-50 ru
 E-friend kiosks charge directly from customers
 sharma bataate he, “gramin kshetra main ek kiyosk prati maah 5,000 ru
 15,000 to Rs
 tak kama saktaa he, to shahari kshetra main isse bhi zyada
 "if all the work is online then there is also a record of earning of the e-mitra kiosk, so that there is no fear of disturbances
 online gadabadi bhale hi na ho lekin in kiyosk par ofline lut jamkar ho rahi he
 Even at some places, five times more than the fixed fee is being collected
 pradesh main i-mitra kiyosk par beete maheene 81 lakh kaam hue hai
 From this, it can be estimated how much illegal recovery can happen
 darasal, adhiktar kiyosk par sarkaar kii ore se tay shulk suchi chaspaan nahin kii jaati, jisase log jhaanse main aa jate hai
 Additional money is also being collected in the name of the form and photo copy
 vahiin atal seva kendron par sambandhit kaam ke dastavej bhi taiyaar karwaae ja rahe hai, jinamein gram sevak yaa sarpanch kii muhar lagaani hoti he
 Instead, operators charge extra
 ise kaam karwaane kii jaldi kahen yaa sarkari yojanaon se vanchit hone kaa dar, gramin aasaani se avaidh rakam de rahe hai
 The farmer leader of Deedwana, Bhagirath Yadav, laughs, pointing out, "this is a convenience fee that was previously paid to the lower staff of Babu or Panchayat, but now this fee is being worked on immediately
" ”vahiin ity or communication vibhaag, nagaur ke jila adhikari ghanashyam goyal bataate hai, “hamaare paas is tarah kii koi shikaayat nahin ai he
 He has acted on more than 100 e-mitra kiosks in the past due to irregularities, which did not list the list of fixed charges
 vahiin ofline charge vasuulne ke aarope main pradesh bhar main kareeb ek darjan kiyosk ke license radd kiye gaye hai
 Still the loot continues
 udhar i-mitra ke paas jane se pehle graahakon ko sambandhit kaary ke dastavej taiyaar karaane ke liye aaj bhi bhatakana pad rahaa he
 The government is also being accused of linking public services directly with e-mitra without resources
 kai gaanvon main aaj bhi bijli na ke baraabar aati he to kai gaanvon main broadband kii suvidha to dur phone conection bhi nahin hai
 For example, in the village of Faraud, about 30 km from Nagaur district headquarters, phone connections have been cut for the last four years
 yahaan ke enarai sarpanch or nagaur sarpanch sangh ke adhyaksh hanmanram farbooda kehete hai, “jile main saikadon aise gaanv hai jahaan broadband suvidha nahin he
 In which case, e-friend will work with the help of ”baharhaal, saare vibhaagon kii sevaayen i-mitra par utaarne kii sarkaar kii pahal rang laa rahi he or logon kaa sarkari kaam unke ilaake main hi ho rahaa he
 But at the same time, the government also needs to monitor e-mitra, otherwise they can also spoil the image of the government among the public

 Date 3rd February, at half past one in the night, place Rohini Police Station
 achaanak police control room kii ghanti bajati he
 As soon as i pick up the phone, the voice comes from the other side: 'I have killed my wife and child, you come
 'police kuch samaj paati usase pehle hi wo apane ghar kaa pataa bhi bataa detaa he
 House number 112, Pocket 11, Sector 22, Rohini and after this the phone is disconnected
 phone karne vaala phone kaatane ke kuch second baad phir ek number dial karata he
 The number was from the Bhogal area of south Delhi and he made the call to his in-laws
 duusari taraf phone uthaate hi wo phir kahata he: 'maine shweta or garv ko maar diya he, aap aa jaaie
 As soon as he says this, he disconnects the phone
 udhar phone rakhte hi sasuraal vaale sann rah jate hai par phir unhen lagata he ki shaayad unka damaad nitin mazaaq kar rahaa he
 So he turns around and calls his son-in-law at the same time and says that such a joke is not a good thing on such a night
 duusari taraf se phir vahi awaz aati he: 'main mazaaq nahin kar rahaa, maine sachmuch donon ko maar diya he, aap aa jaaie
 After this, the phone is disconnected
 phone par khabar milte hi police fouran bataae hue pate par pahunchati he
 As soon as the door opens, the police ask about Nitin
 tamaam ghar vaale tab gahari neend main the, unhen kuch bhi pataa nahin tha
 All he knew was that Nitin is sleeping in his room with his wife Shweta and four-year-old son Garvey
 police sidhe nitin ke kamare main jaati he, daravaaza andar se band tha
 The door does not open even after a lot of beating and sound
 lihaaza majabuuran police darwaja todane kaa faisla karti he or phir kisi tarah kundi tod kar darwaja khol detii he
 There was a strange mood inside, Nitin was sitting on the bed, and two people were sleeping on the same bed with him, both Shweta and Garvey were inside the quilt
 police or gharavaalon ko dekhte hi nitin pehali baar munh kholta he
 Nitin says that i have killed my wife and son, but they do not get cold so i have put a quilt on them
 ab jahaan mujhe le janaa he le chaliye
 After this, the truth of Nitin is revealed as soon as the police remove the quilt
 saamne sachmuch shweta or garv kii laash padi thi, donon ko galaa ghont kar maaraa gaya tha
 The murderer, the murderer's confession and two corpses were in front of the police
 cese aaine kii tarah saaf tha, par phir tabhi jaise hi police nitin ko gaur se dekhati he chaunk uthati he
 How can a person who has been standing on his feet for the last six years not get up and sit without taking any support, Nitin can kill two or two? Nitin first calls the police and then his in-laws call his wife and Confession of son's murder was accepted
 camere ko dekhakar nitin apana cheharaa kambal main chupa rahaa he, darasal nitin chal nahin saktaa
 In a road accident that took place six years ago, his entire waist-down part became useless
 tab se wo wheel chair par tha or isiilie giraftaar ke baad bhi pulisavaale use god main uthaa kar le ja rahe hai
 Now the question is, can Nitin bleed with his hands in such a situation? Could Shweta be so easily controlled? Wouldn't Shweta have tried to save herself? And did the housemates not hear any sound from the room? When the police started investigating the matter with these questions, it was found that everything was fine in the house till Thursday night
 balki guruuvar raat to ghar main jashn kaa maahaul tha
 On February 2, Nitin and Shweta had their sixth wedding anniversary
 is maukey par ghar main party rakhi gai thi, party main nitin or shweta ke gharavaale bhi shariq hue the
 After this, the party ended before midnight and everyone went to sleep in their respective rooms
 nitin bhi shweta or garv ke saath apane kamare main so rahaa tha, garv ko subah skool janaa tha
 Since Nitin could not move, Shweta must have locked the latch of the room herself
 gharavaalon kii maane to puri party or party ke baad ek pal ko bhi aisa nahin laga ki nitin gusse main yaa pareshaan he, wo sabase hans kar baaten kar rahaa tha
 But what happened after hours of going inside the room that he killed his wife and son with his own hands? After all, what happened late last night after the anniversary party that Nitin killed his wife and son with his own hands? And then he himself called the police and in-laws to inform them about the murder? So after the initial investigation, the police are also assuming that both the killings were done by Nitin
 darasal jis kamare main katl hua us kamare ke daravaaje kii kundi andar kii taraf se band thi
 There was none other than Nitin, Shweta and Proud in the room
 yahaan tak ki khud nitin bhi andar se kundi nahin khol saktaa tha
 According to the police, Nitin was drunk when he was arrested late at night, he was drunk
 yani usne donon katl nashe main kiye, par usne katl kiya kyon?police ke mutabik nitin or shweta ne lav marij kii thi or donon shaadi ke baad bhi behad khush the
 But Nitin had become irritable since coming on the wheel chair, Shweta's going to work started shaking her
 use shweta ko lekar shaq hone laga tha, shaayad use kahin naa kahin ye dar bhi sataane laga tha ki kahin shweta apahiz samaj kar se chhod naa de or isiilie usne maa-bete ko maar daalaa
 But the people of Shweta's own house have something else to say
 is dohare katl ko lekar unki apni kahani he or is kahani main nitin ke gharavaale bhi shaamil hai
 Many aspects of this painful tale of double murder are astonishing
 nitin or shweta kii shaadi unki apni marzi se hui thi
 The two loved each other, Nitin's family says that Shweta's family did not like this relationship
 lekin shaadi ke baad rishte behatar ho chale the, tabhi hua haadasa or nitin wheel chair par aa gaya
 Nitin's family members say that after the accident, Shweta's family wanted to get her married to Nitin's brother
 laachaar or berojgaar nitin wheel chair se uthakar khadaa bhi nahin ho saktaa tha
 The expenditure of the house was on the earnings of two of Nitin's brothers
 is dauraan nitin kii patni shweta ek enjio main naukari karne lakshmi nagar jane lagi lekin nitin ko haragiz nahin pasand tha ki uski bivi naukari kare
 Now one more important thing
 
 
 shweta ke gharavaale is hatyakand main nitin ke bhaaiyon par bhi shaq jataa rahe hai
 In fact, Nitin received a compensation of Rs 21 lakh for the incident
 nitin ne apni bivi or bachche ko nomini banaaya tha, to kya is baat se is dohare qatl kaa koi naata he? police tamaam pahaluon par gaur kar rahi he

 The story of 'the Lowland' has been woven on the basis of India and America and will be published in September
 landan ke saahitiyik galiyaaron main ise aasaan or prabal daavedaar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Born in London in 1967 and living in New York, Lahiri is the daughter of an Indian diaspora from West Bengal
 unhone varsh 2000 main pulitzer puraskaar jeeta tha jo unhen unke pehle kahani sangrah ‘interprator aaf maladies’ or pehle upanyaas ‘da nemsek’ ke liye mila tha

 The minister said that the current tax system is only valid for one more year

 amit mitra ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke achaanak notebandi abhiyaan se rajyon kii arthvyavastha charmara gai he
 It is worth mentioning that GST will replace all central and state taxes to create a single market across the country
 iske chalate rajyon ke karon ke hatane se unke nuksaan kii bharpai centre agle paanch varshon tak karegaa
 But Mitra said the government should do additions and deletions again and this has led to skepticism when it is implemented next April
 natijatan sarkaar ko sahi samay par jiesti lagu karne par ab vichaar karnaa chahie
 Calling the demonetisation decision a 'tactical' hit, Amit Mitra said, "I am very concerned about the timing of GST
 ab log mandi kii baat karne lage hai
 Due to this the two percent fall in GDP is a serious thing, in such a situation what is the possible implementation of GST? ”he said that due to this, he would put his concern before the Finance Ministers of other states how their revenue would be affected by it

 darasal, pashchim bengal ke vitt mantri amit mitra jiesti parishad main shaamil hai, joki is tex kii dar or daayre kaa draft taiyaar kar rahi he
 Amit Mitra said that the sudden demonetization drive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shaken the economy of the states
 ullekhneey he ki puure desh main ekal bazaar banane ke makasad se jiesti tamaam kendriya or rajya karon kaa sthaan legaa
 Due to this, the Center will compensate for the loss of the states from their taxes for the next five years

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2018 may include the promotion of Make in India from one of his flagship programs
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki daavos main mangalvaar ko piem modi kaa sambodhan saal 2014 ke swatantraaa diwas ke unke pehle bhaashan jaisaa ho saktaa he
 He will push for India's major economic reforms and the rise in ranking of business ease to impress global economic giants and make them come to India and join 'make in India'
 gauratlab he ki daavos main yojit world iconomic forum main duniya kii diggaj companiyon ke 200 se zyada siio, 70 deshon ke rashtradhyaksh or antarrashtriya sanghathanon ke 45 mukhiya shirkat kar rahe hai
 On this global stage, business leaders and business leaders of the world discuss major economic issues
 piem modi kaa is diggaj aarthik manch par pehla bhaashan hoga
 The largest ever Indian delegation of more than 100 members has gone with PM Modi 
 apane bhaashan se pehle piem modi ne twit kar kaha he, 'daavos main main bharat ke bhavishya main antarrashtriya samudaay ke saath judaav par apane vijan ko saajha karnaa chaahunga
 'soon after taking charge in the year 2014, PM Modi talked about making India the next manufacturing hub of the world
 kuch dinon baad hi unhone mek in india kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 In his first Independence Day speech in 2014, PM Modi had called upon companies from all over the world to come to India and do manufacturing
 ' is bhaashan main unhone kaha tha, 'duniya ke kisi bhi desh main aap saamaan bechein, lekin use yahaan banaaen
 We have the skills, talent, discipline and perseverance to do something
 ham duniya ko yahaan aane ke liye anukool avasar dena chaahate hai

 piem modi ke saamne yah mauka he ki ve phir se ek baar duniya kii diggaj companiyon ko bharat aane kaa nyauta den, unhen yahaan ke badale kaarobaari maahaul, badali sarkari nitiyon ke bare main prabhavit karen or bharat akarmanuphaccharingyani mek in india ke liye prerit karen
 ' yah lijie! oont yani registan kaa titannic dub rahaa he
 All government measures to save it seem to be insufficient
 ab se ek dashak pehle aabaadi ke lihaaj se bhartiya uunton kaa sudan or somalia ke baad teesraa sthaan tha
 But the latest figures of their calculations show that they have now reached the 10th position
 registani 'titannic' ke doobane kaa khatarnaak manjar dikhaane ke liye kuch aankade rakhana jaruri hoga
 In 2001, the number of camels in the country was more than 1 million
 dhyaan rahe ki pradeshon main uunton kii gananaa har chaar saal main hoti he
 The last count was done in 2011 but its figures are not yet available
 or agar rajasthan kii hi baat karen to 2001 ke mukaable 2007 main pradesh main uunton kii aabaadi aadhe ke kareeb aa gai
 Accordingly, today's situation can be easily estimated
 desh main sabase zyada oont rajasthan main hi paae jate hai
 4 in 2007
 36 lakh oont yahaan ke registani samandar main tairne ke liye bache the
 Four years later, obviously, it must have decreased
 desh or pradesh main uunton kii lagaataar kam hoti aabaadi kii sabase badi vajah he is pashu kaa lagaataar anupayogi hote janaa
 Earlier, camels used to be the most useful means for traffic in thousands of km sandy sea of rajasthan and in the plowing etc
 par kheti main mashiinon ke badhate upyog kii vajah se inaki jarurat lagaataar ghatati ja rahi he
 On the other hand, pastures are also being cleared in the strong wave of development, which have been the biggest source of fodder for camels

 Sharma explains, 'the desert ship today is two to four with increasing mechanization
 nagaur bail kii misaal bhi kuch aisi hi he
 It is true that it is sixteen that the cattle ranchers did not have enough pastures
 bikaner ke mahajan gaanv ke bhikhaaram rika kaa daawa he ki unke gaanv main charaagaah ke liye koi jameen hi nahin bachi
 Apart from this, he remains there for four months for the firing range of the army running nearby
 gaanvon ke aasapaas kuch charnot or naadiyon vaali jameen bhi hoti thi, jahaan pashu charaa karte the
 Now there is nothing left in the name of fodder too
 yah bhi sach he ki oont kii bajaae bhens, gaay, bhend or bakrii sareekhe duusare paaltu pashu zyada phydemand sabit ho rahe hai
 The cattle rearers earn a little from them
 un par kharch bhi kam aata he or saar-sambhaal bhi utani nahin kerani padati
 The recent World Animal Census report is questioning all the government measures that have crores of rupees in their names
 kharch ho chuke hai
 And there are camels that are decreasing rather than growing
 haalanki tamaam koshishon ke liye tark bhi gadhe hi ja rahe hai

 patil kehete hai, ‘ham apni yojanaon ke jariye is pashu kii upyogita sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 For the protection of camels, camel keepers will be organized at the government level
 centre ne iske liye ek yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya he, jisamen uunton kii nasl main gunatmak sudhaar ke liye unke rahane vaale sthaan ke aasapaas hi kaam kiya jayega
 a breeding plan has been prepared at the range level
 ’chaliye, thodi der ke liye maan lete hai ki uunton ke sangrakshan kii sarkari yojanaayen sahi disha main chal rahi hai
 But the question of lacquer vaccines comes out that why should farmers keep camels? Will all the government departments and their schemes be able to make this animal equal to other milch animals? Research centers and other government schemes have also tried to attract the cattlemen to this animal but between the expenditure i
e
 cost and net profit Due to the absence of distance, the herders are now escaping from traveling by this ship
 anusandhan ne haalanki kai badhiya or safal prayog kiye
 For example, camel milk started making chocolate
 ab uske doodh se paneer bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 Research officials also confirm that the quality of things made from camel milk is manifold
 patil yahaan jodate hai, ‘sarkaar ko duusare utpaadon kii tarah in utpaadon ko bhi super market main bechnaa chahie
 'they are confident that one day these products will sell fiercely
 yani ye jahaaj dubegaa nahin? patil ko to aisa hi lagata he
 At this research center in Bikaner, four breeds of camels across the country are currently being worked on
 ye hai bikaaneri, jaisalmeri, mewari or kacchi
 The center currently has about 300 camels
 manushya main hone vaali bimariyon kaa ilaaj uunton main paae jane vaale antigen se kiye jane par bhi shodh chal rahe hai
 Actually 4 species of camels are found in the country
 inamen teen to akele rajasthan main hai-bikaaneri, jaisalmeri or mewari
 The fourth species Kachchi is found in the Kutch area of gujarat
 inamen se mewari or kacchi prajatiyon ke uunton kii taadaad main haal ke varshon main teji se kami aati dekhi gai he
 Jaisalmeri camels run much faster than the rest of the camels
 ooncha kad, patali or lambii taangon vaale ye oont jaisalmer, barmer or jodhpur ke retile dhoron main rahete hai
 They are used extensively to guard the border
 lekin inaki aabaadi aise hi ghatati rahi to is kaam ke liye bhi ye milane mushkil ho jaaenge

 November 8, 2016
 raat aath baje achaanak pradhanmantri narendra modi ne raashtra ke naam apane sambodhan main 500 or 1000 ke note band karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 With Modi's announcement, as if there was a stir in the whole country
 har koi atm kii ore bhaag rahaa tha, koi petrol pump kii taraf ja rahaa tha
 Nobody could understand what exactly happened
 vipaksh ne sarkaar ke is faisle ko loktantr kaala din bataaya or lagaataar iskaa virodh kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation and asked people to cooperate for 50 days
 notebandi ke dauraan bainkon or atm ke baahar kaaphi dinon tak logon kii bheed jamaa ho gai thi
 The Modi government has consistently called demonetisation a success and the opposition is opposing it today as Black Day
 vipaksh main aar-parnotbandi kii saalagirah par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi twitor ke jariye logon ko dhanyavad kiya
 He wrote 'I bow to the people of India for their strong support to the strict steps taken by the government to eradicate black money and corruption' i bow to the people of India for steadfastly supporting the several measures taken by the Government to eradicate corruption and black money

 Zyan Dreze, a well-known economist and member of the National Advisory Council during the UPA tenure, compared demonetisation, saying that the act is the same as if someone was shot at the wheel of a fast racing car

 Another user wrote that today is the first anniversary of my dear countrymen
 notebandi ke baad bana tha desh kaa pehla 'cashles' gaanv, ab yahaan chalati he sirf nakadipradhanmantri narendra modi ne 8 november 2016 ko jab 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note band karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, tab cashles hone kii bayaar chal padi thi
 In the same wind, a village in Madhya Pradesh was first declared as 'cashless village'

 sansad kii yah samiti jaananaa rigerv bank or vitt mantralay se jaananaa chaahati thi ki aakhir notebandi kaa faisla kab, kaise or kiske dwaara liya gaya
 Debate in India, but efforts like demonetisation failed in these countries, crores of people in the country did not understand what is the purpose of this decision and what should they do with the currency that has been declared as waste
 ab notebandi ko ek saal bich chukaa he
 The biggest question today is whether the demonetisation was the right decision of the central government or has time proved the verdict wrong? Demonetisation has not resulted in a political loss, bjp's successive BJP declared it to be action against black money If the opposition parties campaigned against demonetisation
 notebandi ke chand dinon baad desh ke kai rajyon main nagar nikaay or vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ne ek ke baad ek jeet hasil kii or vipaksh dalon ko baari nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Nobel laureate Richard, who was in favor of demonetisation, told the 2000 note that these wrong supporters also include the name of Nobel Laureate Professor Richard Thaler in economics
 bataa den ki richard theller ne notebandi ke dauraan iskaa samarthan kiya tha or iske samarthan main twit bhi kiya tha
 Thaler described it as a first step in the fight against corruption
 notebandi par 'palaturam': pehle kiya saport, phir maangi maafijab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne iskaa elaan kiya tha, uske baad se hi deshbhar main unka virodh shuru ho gaya tha
 But this decision was openly welcomed by some people
 inamen kai hastiyaan bhi shaamil rahi thim

 How did a farmer spend the entire year like this? 
 
 ye samajhane kaa prayaas kiya 'ajtak' ne
 Demonetisation: What happened? PM Modi's promise of saving the common man 10 thousand rupees, along with the benefits of Kanotbandi, PM Modi promised that this step will save up to 10 rupees per month in the pocket of the common man in the country
 notebandi main villen bane jan dhan khate? jaane ek saal main kya huaaankadon kii baat karen to kendra sarkaar ne kalaadhan kaa bahi-khaataa rakhane ke liye jis garib kalyaan yojana ko launch kiya usamen mahaj 5,000 karod rupye ekatra hue hai
 This money can be called black money recovered from demonetisation till date
 modi sarkaar ko cash se dikkat lekin japan main top gear par he cash iconomidesh main 8 november ko notebandi kaa elaan karne ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi japan ke daure par chale gaye the
 The special thing is that the central government announced demonetisation in the country and made efforts to make India a digital economy
 lekin is elaan ke turant baad japan kii yatra par pahunche piem modi vahaan rubaru hue cash iconomi se or vah bhi top gear main chalane vaali
 Demonetisation: First snatching up, now one year back on track, business is completing one year of demonetization on 8 November

 The petition said that two judges hearing the case have been transferred, due to which it is getting late for justice and execution of the culprits
 bataa den ki supreme court ne apane faisle main doshiyon kii faansee kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Why transfer the case to another judge? Actually, two judges who are hearing sexual matters in special fast track court have been transferred, at present no judge has been appointed

 In this notice, the Tihar Jail administration had told the four convicts that if they file mercy petition before the President, then tell the administration, else the jail administration will take further action under the law as per the court order and the death penalty within seven days will be given

 'unhone bataaya ki haalanki namakan waapas lene kii taarikh (20 november) biit chuki he, isliye saluja kii ummidavaari aadhikarik taur par waapas nahin lee ja sakati
 But now he is not a party candidate
 rajouri garden se ab aam aadmi party kii ore se koi nahin ladega
 The dowry harassment case against Preetpal was reported by the party that in October 2012, an FIR was registered against Saluja and three family members in Lucknow
 lakhanu police kii ore se daakhil kii gai chargeshit main unke khilaaf dahej utpeedan kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 Yogendra Yadav said, 'on November 11, a notice was issued to him by the trial court, which probably did not reach him till November 14
 14 november ko hi saluja ne aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar ke taur par namakan bharaa tha
 That is, there was technically no case against him while filing his nomination
 'party kaa daawa, chunaav ke itihaas main aisa pehali barparty ne daawa kiya ki saluja ke khilaaf abhi court main koi maamla sabit nahin hua he, phir bhi party yah faisla le rahi he
 Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, in the Supreme Court, looked at all the papers in the case, found them authentic, after which the party decided
 unhone daawa kiya ki chunaavon ke itihaas main yah pehali baar he jab chunaav se thik pehle party ne kisi ummidavaar ko aapraadhik maamla darj hone kii vajah se waapas le liya
 Yogendra also apologized to the voters of Rajouri Garden Assembly

 "A bench headed by Justice Aftab Alam told the government," We do not want to be harsh with you in the matter
 ham udaartaa dikhaa rahe hai, lekin is tarah nahin chalegaa
 The bench made the remarks when senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appointed to assist the court, pointed out that the government had not taken any action against anyone during the last 12 years after the scam was busted
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘ham (kendra kii karrwai se) jaraa bhi khush nahin hai
 Dwivedi said that there is a lack of political will from the government to take action in this matter

 The court adjourned the case till 28 November after briefly hearing the case
 adaalat kargil main ‘oparation vijay’ ke liye raksha kharidariyon se jude kathith ghotaale par ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 Earlier, Dwivedi referred to the CAG report stating that nearly 75 per cent of the supplies worth Rs 2,163 crore were received much after the end of the conflict and hence it did not help the campaign in any way
 adaalat ne isse pehle chintaa jataai thi ki agar sarkari vibhaag sieji kii reporton ko dabaae rakhe or abhiyojan ke liye manjuuri dene se inkaar karte rahe to desh main ‘arajak sthiti’ utpann ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that the CAG found 35 cases of deficiencies and irregularities in defense purchases

 unhone test cap pahanane se pehle kaaphi ekadivasiy match khele lekin tab bhi ve acha pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Raina played 98 odis before playing the first Test
 unhone ab tak 15 test khele hai jinamein vah 29
 He has scored only 710 runs at an average of 58
 kohli ko 59 vanade khilne ke baad test khilne kaa mauka mila lekin vah chah match main 21
 He has scored 234 runs at an average of 27
 rohit bhi abhi tak 72 ekadivasiy match khel chuke hai
 The reason for his failure is not being able to play on the backfoot on fast and bouncy balls
 upmahadweep kii sapaat pichon par front foot par jaakar shaat maarna aasaan hota he
 Foreign pitches have a bounce greater than knee height and do not have the technical skills to play parallel shots
 iskaa parinaam he ki ve asafal ho rahe hai
 Most experts believe that by consistently hitting in Twenty20 and ODI international matches, they have failed to meet the real test of Test cricket
 bhartiya paristhitiyaan bhi ballebaajon ke vikaas ke anukool nahin hai
 Ranji Trophy pitches are lifeless
 iske alaava 80 pratishat antarrashtriya cricket swadesh main khelaa jaataa he tathaa kaaphi ekadivasiy match khel ja rahe hai
 Along with this, the IPL is also being played
 jo bhi coach hai ve yuva khilaadiyon ko yah nahin bataate ki unhen apni takanic sudhaarney ke liye gendon ko rakshaatmak tareeke se khelkar rokna he
 Anyone wants to raise money and earn money as soon as possible
 purv bhartiya ballebaaj sanjay manjrekar ne bataaya ki jab vah nets par hawa main shaat khilne kaa prayaas karte the to unki kalai par chot pad jaati thi
 Coaches also believe that such shots can be played on Indian pitches but such is not possible on bouncy pitches
 kuch purv bhartiya ballebaajon ne bhi bataaya ki kis tarah se unhen lafted shaat khilne par balla sir ke upar uthaakar puure maidan kaa chakkar lagane kii sajaa di jaati thim austrailia ke vartmaan captain or sidney main tihare shatak jadne vaale maaikel clark achche udhaaharan hai
 Clarke said that he refused to play in the IPL and Twenty20 Big Bash because he wanted to be a good batsman
 clark ne kaha ki maine twanti 
 Good decision except 20 and focusing on odis and Test matches
 mujhe lagata he ki maine apane khel main sudhaar kiya or vaisaa khilaadi bana jaisaa ki main sambhavat: ban saktaa tha

 or bundelkhand ke vir sapoot bhaaiyon or bahanonye meraa saubhaahgya he ki aaj mujhe is vir bhoomi par aane kaa saubhaahgya mila
 And whenever it comes to the freedom struggle of 1857, the Parcham of Bundelkhand, the Parcham of Jhansi comes to new heights all over India
 ye vir bhoomi he
 It is also the land of intelligent people
 or jiske liye hamaari vartmaan peedi garv karti he, wo hockey ke jaadugar dhyanchand bhi isi mitti kii paidaaish the
 (cheers from the crowd) i bow to that soil
 main aapke paas rone dhone nahin aayaa hum
 i have not come to shed tears na aansu bahaane waalon kii koi katha sunaane aayaa hum
 i have come here today to give you the confidence to wipe your tears
 main sankalp lekar aayaa hum ki bundelkhand kii kathinaaiyon main ji rahi, garibi main punap rahi, yahaan ke garib ke aansu ponchney kaa main sankalp lekar aayaa hum
 Despite the rivers and water, the Bundelkhand Pyasakya does not have power in the people, the farmers here do not have power
 agar dam nahin he
 
 
 So not in Lucknow and Delhi
 (bheed kaa shor) unako parvaah nahin he
 brothers Sisters
 main helicopter se aa rahaa tha
 So many rivers, so much water, why is Bundelkhand Pisa even after that
 yahaan kii dharti sukhi kyon he
 Why is the farmer here forced to commit suicide
 bhaaiyon bahanon main dilli kii sultanate se sidhaa sawaal poochta hum
 Answer kya kaaran he ki jahaan jahaan unke pair pade, unako shashan karne kaa avasar mila he
 Whether it is Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra
 usamen bhi chaahe vidarbha kaa sookhaa ilaaka ho or chaahe congress kaa samarthan karne vaali yahaan kii sarkaar ho
 Why do my farmer siblings commit suicide in all these states
 hindustan ke or rajyon main aisa he kya
 Neither these people care about the village, nor do they care about the poor, nor do they care about the farmer
 apni jeb ke liye baantate hai packagejab chunaav aate hai to hamaare congress ke mitra revadi baantne lag jate hai
 And nowadays, wherever we go, we talk about packets and packages
 aapke yahaan bhi aayaa tha
 You must have thought that he had come to do good
 nahin mitron
 That package was not for your benefit, it was sent to throw a piece to silence the leaders of UP
 dilli or lakhanu ne milakar aapas main baant liya package, aapke yahaan nahin aayaa
 Someone should tell me, the market was going to be constructed here
 hua (bheed se aawaaj aati he 'nahin hua') yahaan kuan khodne kii baat kii gai thi
 Is seen
 yahaan nadiyon par checkdam banane kii baat hui thim
 Somewhere water appears
 to rupaya gaya kahaan
 This package is for their pocket
 shivaraj ne kharch kii package kii pai-paior bhaaiyon bahanon, ye bundelkhand ko jo package mila, uskaa aadha hissaa upi ke bundelkhand ko mila or aadha empi main padane vaale bundelkhand ko
 And today i can proudly say that the honorable Shivraj Singh Ji Chauhan, the soldier of my party, when the package came to him, the pie was spent for the good of Bundelkhand
 uskaa nateeja ye rahaa ki 30 pratishat se zyada bhoomi ko sinchai pahunchane kaa kaam puraa kar diya
 The crop used to be in that area earlier
 usase teen guna fasal shivaraj ji ne paidaa kar dikhaai
 Today i am not saying this as the leader of the BJP
 planning kamishan, jiske adhyaksh desh ke piem hote hai
 He said that if someone made good use of this package, then the MP government, BJP used it and looted everything here
 aapke naam par aata he
 Jaata is in his pocket
 or isliye bhaaiyon-bahanon, ab ye package kii baaten bahut ho chuki hai
 Now the time has come to pack the sp-bsp-congress and leave
 sapa ke karnaamon se raamamanohar lohia ko hoti hogi pidaaye sapa yahaan jo karnam karti he
 Wherever Ram Manohar Lohia would be, he would have suffered so much, which he cannot even imagine
 ye sabakaa lutate hai
 Samajwadi's party, Bahujan Samaj Party's and Congress's
 yani sabakaa
 These three trio rob
 inhone upi ko, bundelkhand ko tabah kar diya he
 i have also visited in UP
 jab sanghathan kaa kaam karata tha, yahaan ke har jile main gaya hum
 The people here have to go
 yahaan kii prakritik sampada ko samajha he
 i say with confidence that UP has so much power that UP alone can eradicate the poverty of entire India on its own
 ye takat upi main he
 But they are not interested in developing, nor are they interested in creating a future for the youth here
 unhen sirf satta kaa ganit bananaa
 Doing politics of alliances, fighting brother to brother, sharing them all, this is their business
 ham aapaki takadir bhi badal denge or desh kii tasviir bhi badal dengebhaayiyon bahanon agar upi kii dharti par, sab vaadon kaa ikattha yahaan laalan paalan hua he
 All the suits have emerged here
 ye dharti he, jahaan ek taraf congress kaa ahankaarwaad he, samaajawaadee party kaa parivaarwaad he or bahujan samaaj party kaa vyaktvaad he, ye vaadon se bhare hue log aapke vaade puraa karnaa nahin chaahate
 They want to fill their own stomach
 or isliye bhaaiyon, bahanon
 Until Uttar Pradesh resolves to get rid of these three types of crises, my young friends, your fate cannot change
 mitron aaj main, shashan ke mere anubhav ke aadhaar par aapako vishwaas dilaane aayaa hum
 Seeing the work that i got the privilege of doing in the last 12-13 years, i have come to assure you
 main deshavaasiyon ko kahata hum, jhaansi kii dharti se kahata hum, rani lakshmibai kaa punya samaran karte hue kahata hum
 My countrymen, you gave the Congress sixty years
 hamen sirf saath maheene dekar ke dekho
 What they have destroyed in sixty years
 main bijepi ke sipaahi ke naate vishwaas dilaataa hum ki aapane saath maheene ke liye bhi avasar diya to ham aapaki takadir bhi badal denge or desh kii takadir bhi badal denge
 (modi-modi's noise
 
 
 bhaashan ruk jaataa he kuch der ke liye)upi-bihar ke logon kii mehnat se gujarat chamak rahaa habhaaiyon-bahanon, aap mujhe bataaie
 My young friends will answer my question
 man se baat karenge
 Is any young man from Bundelkhand? apana gaanv, apana ghar chhodkar ke mumbai kii, gujarat kii jhuggi jhonpadi main janaa chahta hum
 (no Noise) wants to leave his old parents, he wants to wander from living to living (no Noise) Brothers and sisters, he forced you to leave the village
 pet bharne ke liye
 To fill the stomach of the parents, the young man is sweating on the soil of Gujarat
 bhaaiyon main garv se kahata hum upi-bihar andhra ke logon ne itnaa pasinaa bahaya ki unki mehnat se meraa gujarat chamak rahaa he
 If this sweat had been shed here, where would my Uttar Pradesh and Bundelkhand have reached? maine ek nayaa prayog kiya he
 We called some factorymen
 inamen upi ke bihar ke noujvaan mazdooree karte hai
 Now they work for eight hours
 phir chale jate hai
 There are 25 people in a room
 maine inhen kaha ki aap hisaab lagaaie ki agar ye saptaah main chah din aath ghante kaam karata he
 Gives as much output
 uskaa hisaab lagaaie
 If he feels like working two to four hours more
 or usko jodie or us output ke aadhaar par uske kaam ke ghante tay kiye jaaen
 It will work if it is encouraging, it will not work, or it will not
 ye apane aapako badshaah or shahjada maanate hanmitron payalat project shuru kiya
 The youth here, instead of eight, started working for 12-13 hours, working for one year in six months
 maine kaha ki ye jo noujvaan chah maheene main kaam kar gaye hai
 Give them six months' leave with salary
 or chuttee tab do, jab yahaan kheti kaa mausam ho, khet kaa kaam niklaa ho
 He will work in the field here
 maa baap kii madad karegaa
 Will get salary phir waapas jaakar kaam karegaa
 If this pilot project is successful, then my youth will do good for UP and also for Gujarat
 kyon aayaa ye vichaar
 Because i felt that the boys here should get all kinds of opportunities
 magar dilli ke paas sochane ke liye samay bhi nahin he
 Now the Lok Sabha elections have come
 ye dilli waalon ko apane kaam kaa hisaab dena chahie ki nahin
 Now what are you saying? jo saajha gum rahe hai
 Answer what you have to say on corruption
 kyon nahin de rahe jawaab
 This inflation, this rape of mothers and sisters
 jawaab dene ko taiyaar nahin
 You tell me that this elected government is a servant of the people or not
 janata ko jawaab dena chahie ki nahin
 They consider themselves to be kings and shahzada
 chunaav aae to puraane jakhm kured rahe hai shahjademain sun rahaa hum
 The speech that Shahzade gave
 main gambhir sawaal uthaanaa chahta hum
 He said that when my grandmother died
 mujhe bahut gussa aayaa
 i want to ask Shahzade whether it is true that all the Congressmen got angry
 kya ye sach he ki aapane or aapaki party ke logon ne hajaaron sikhon ko jinda jala diya or aaj tak ek ko bhi sajaa nahin hui
 Did you just get angry with grandma's death? kya aapako un hajaaron sikhon ko maarane waalon par gussa aayaa
 Troubled
 or aaj jab dilli main chunaav aae hai, to aapane us ghaav par namak chhidakane kaa paap kiya he
 The families whose youth were burnt alive and today you are talking about the anger over the grandmother's death
 maanavtaa main yakeen karne vaala koi bhi vyakti unhen maaf nahin kar saktaa
 Why the intelligence of India go to Shahzade and report a serious question
 aakhir ye shahjade hai koun
 Is an MP
 kya hindustan ke intelligence ke log
 How are you sharing India's most secret information with a person who has not taken any oath of secrecy
 desh jaananaa chahta he or aae din hindustan kii sarkaar ke liye ghanton vivaad karne waalon se bhi poochna chahta hum
 Someone can tell why the intelligence of India goes to Shahzade and reports
 khufia agency ke log unke rajnatik bhaashanon ke liye input dete hai
 He said that the ISI is in touch with Muslim youth in Muzaffar Nagar
 shahjade, desh main hukumat kii party kii he
 What is the reason that ISI has the power to spread its foot under your nose in UP
 aap kya kar rahe ho
 The country demands answers
 aapane relif camp main rah rahe logon par ek gambhir lagaaya he ki ve log iesai se mili hai
 Shahzade Saheb is your responsibility
 wo koun noujvaan hai, unke naam saarvajanik karo
 Who are those who have met with ISI
 or agar naam ghoshit nahin karte ho,to kisi kaum par is tarah kaa iljaam lagane se pehle aapkaa jimmaa banataa he
 And if there is no name, then you should publicly apologize to those youth of the country
 ye aapkaa jimmaa he
 The government of Delhi seems to be the news agency, the government of Delhi
 aisa lagata he ki jaise wo koi news agency he
 Whose job is to give news only to us
 ki iesai ye kar rahi he
 Hey your job is to report that ISI is going to be fixed
 mujhe bataaen mitron, kya aap aise netaaon par bharosa kar sakate hai
 Overthrow isane tabaahi kaa manjar kar rakhaa he
 And so brothers and sisters, they are making fun of poverty
 inke liye, garibi ek majaak kaa saadhan ban gaya he
 In the olden days, the king used to have very big palaces of the Maharajas
 samay beetaa
 His downfall happened
 yudhon main paraajay hui
 In time, their big palaces could not be restored, then ruins
 unke bacchon ke baap dada ab khandhar dikhaane le jate hai
 It is said that our grandfather's grandfather ruled from here
 aajkal ye shahjade bhi apane purvajon kaa parakram dekhne lagate hai
 What did our father do? hamaari daadi ji ne kya kiya
 What did our maternal grandfather do? unke parakram kaa avshesh dekhne garib kii jhopadi main jate hai
 This is the result of the might of their ancestors
 aapke bundelkhand main aae the
 Ration cards were also taken
 ab tak lautaaya bhi nahin
 Do you remember? or wo bechaari rashan card ke liye taras rahi he
 It took 60 years, Shahzade makes slogans in reaching from half roti to full roti
 log kehete the ki aadhi roti khaaenge
 Now Shahzade says to say complete bread
 saath saal lag gaye, aadhi roti se puri roti tak pahunchane main
 Brother pet bhar roti main to ye or 100 saal laga denge
 Do you want to wait garibon kaa majaak uda rahe hai
 Friends, tell me whether your family can spend a day for 26 rupees
 shahar main rahane waalon kaa 32 rupee main guzaara ho saktaa he
 Can i have tea with my family? piem jis planning kamishan ke adhyaksh hai, vah kahata he ki aap 26 rupee se, 32 rupee se zyada kamaate ho, to aap garib nahin ho
 Look at his mental poverty
 ye log garibon kaa bhala nahin kar sakate
 They do not even know how the brothers and the poor live, how they spend their lives
 congress, sapa, basapa mukt bharat kii he jaruratamitron aaj jarurat he, congress mukt, sapa mukt or basapa mukt bharat
 Until you bid farewell to those who looted the country
 aapkaa bhala nahin hoga
 Brothers and sisters, there was a slogan in 1857 from this land
 apane bachche ko peeth par baitha kar virangana lakshmi bai ne naaraa diya tha
 i will not give my Jhansi kahaan tha na
 The war of 1857, Roti and Lotus, became the symbol of a revolution
 bhaaiyon or bahanon ye sangram roti or camel lekar aayaa tha or bundelkhand jaag uthaa tha
 Today, we have once again brought a lotus to the land of Lakshmi Bai
 mitron, or lakshmi kahaan virajit hoti he
 She resides on the lotus
 agar camel he, to lakshmi aegi
 And if Lakshmi comes, the bread is sure to come, friends, this revolution has to be brought
 mitron, lakshmi bai ne lalkaar kiya tha ki nahin duungi nahin duungi meri jhaansi nahin duungi
 Friends will call me with a slogan
 puri takat se bulaayenge
 Friends i will say aap jaraa naaraa samaj lijie
 This is the voice of the land of Bundelkhand
 mitron rani lakshmibai ne kaha tha, nahin duungi, nahin duungi, meri jhaansi nahin duungi
 Friends, i say
 beyimaanon ko nahin denge nahin denge
 You say, i will not give my country 
 
 naare kaa shor
 
 
 Speak twice
 
 
 shor or tejamitron ye desh ham beyimaanon ko nahin denge
 The brothers and sisters are robbed
 bhartiya janata party ne mujh jaise ek saamaanya vyakti ko, pichde parivaar main paidaa hua, railway ke dibbe main chaay bechney vaala baccha
 See the greatness of this party

 a person from such a backward family was declared the PM candidate of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon aap mujhe pradhanmantri mat banaaie
 You make me a watchman
 or bhaaiyon bahanon main dilli main jaakar chaukeedaar kii tarah baithunga
 Assure you aap aisa chaukeedaar baithaaoge main desh kii tijori par koi panja nahin padane duungaa
 That is why i want to serve as a watchman
 aapane unhen saath saal die
 Give me sixty months ham takadir bhi badalenge or tasviir bhi
 Speak with full force bharat mata kii jai
 Speak with strength ye media vaale aapaki tasviir lenaa chaahate hai
 There is a lot of excitement in the Congress about the presidential election
 aise main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki abhi raashtrapati chunaav main samay bachaa he or ummidavaaron ko lekar dhairya rakhana chahie
 Earlier today, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also met Sonia Gandhi
 mamata banerjee ne bharosa dilaayaa ki UPA dwaara raashtrapati pad ke liye namit vyakti kaa wo samarthan karengi
 While coming out after meeting at Sonia's residence, the Trinamool Congress chief refused to divulge more details about the meeting

 The loss occurred after Texas purchased an oil refinery in Pasadena
 ‘petrobras’ ke purv pramukh or nideshak mandal ke teen anya sadasyon kii sampatti fries karne kaa aadesh bhi diya gaya he
 Judge Vitale Do Rego said it appears that "deliberate mismanagement was done to cover up the irregularities"

 During this purchase in 2006, Dilma was the Chairman of the Board

 The case of sealing of shops in Delhi is becoming hot
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne ceiling rokane ke liye alji anil baijal ko chitthee likhi thi, jiskaa jawaab dete hue alji daftar ne 'aap' vidhayak ko salaah likh bheji he
 At 3 pm on Monday afternoon, many mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party reached the meeting without any time on the issue of sealing
 alji daftar ke chaaron taraf bericads lagaakar baari police bal tainaat kiya gaya tha
 The police told the AAP mlas that LG had gone to attend the Beating Retreat program, after which all the mlas sat on a dharna near the LG office
 dharne par baithe AAP ke ye vidhayakdharne par baithne vaale vidhayakon kii list main yogya or haal hi main ayogy tehraae vidhayak bhi shaamil rahe
 Among them, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Amanatullah Khan, Sanjeev Jha, Bandana Kumari, Commando Surendra, Jagdeep Singh, Pramila Tokas, Jitendra Tomar, Vishesh Ravi, Hazari Lal Chauhan, Sahi Ram, Rituraj Jha, Sridutt Sharma and Rakhi Birlan sat on the dharna That unless LG Sahab meets, he will just keep on waiting for them
 'khoja ja rahaa he ceiling mudde kaa samaadhaan'is bich uparajyapal neam aadmi party kepravaktaa or greater kailash se vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ko khat likhakar jawaab diya
 LG stated in its letter that they had held several meetings with representatives of shopkeepers and traders to understand aspects related to sealing
 alji ne bataaya ki ceiling ke masale par sabhi nyaayik adeshon or maujuuda kanoonon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, sambhavit samaadhaanon kaa pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 LG gave these suggestions to the mlas
 The Governor further said that this is a complicated matter and if the mlas have some suggestions, they should send it in writing themselves or through the Urban Development Minister because the Urban Development Department is the department which is mixed in the streets
 Reserves the right to issue land related notifications
 alji ne apni chitthee ke ant me vidhayak ko ceiling ke mudde ko badha-chadha kar pesh naa karne kii salaah bhi di he
 Saurabh Bhardwaj replied that Aam Admi Party spokesman and MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj did not delay in responding to the letter from LG
 saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha, 'alji ne hamen ceiling ke mudde par urban divelepment ministry, dilli sarkaar ko apane suzav bhejne ko kaha he
 It is very important to be clear about some things about DDA here
 dilli main ceiling kaa ek kaaran ekher bhi he, jise master plan 2021 main sanshodhan karke badhaayaa ja saktaa he or ceiling ko roka ja saktaa he
 According to the common man party, Delhi's Master Plan 2021 can be amended only by DDA and is the chairman of LG DDA itself
 master plan kaa dilli sarkaar ke shahari vikaas mantralay se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Sharad Pawar voted in Tardeo area of mumbai ipel-10 ke tisare match main kolkata nite rides ne gujarat ke liance ko aisi haar di jise vah lambey arase tak nahin bhuulenge
 The Kolkata team won the match by 10 wickets
 mukaable main kolkata liance ke openar gautam gambhir or kris lin ne team ko dhuandhar shuruyaat di
 Both of them took the news of opposition bowlers fiercely
 praveen kumaar or chinamen shivil kowshik sahit gujarat liance kaa koi bhi gendbaaj in donon par asar nahin daal paaya
 This was the reason that the score board kept 'jumping' like a taxi's meter
 tippaniyan It was a batting season that the team scored the highest IPL score (73 runs) in the powerplay
 team ne pune varirs ke 2012 ke 68 ran ke score ko peeche choda
 During this, the lin-gambhir pair made their first century partnership of IPL-10
 in donon ne pehle wicket ke liye 184 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 This was the biggest partnership for any wicket from Kolkata Knight Riders
 yahi nahin, yah kisi bhi str ke tii-20 cricket main bina wicket khoe chej kiya gaya sarvaadhik score he
 During this, more dangerous Lin appeared, who hit more sixes than fours in his unbeaten 93-run innings
 unki 41 gendon par kheli gai is pari main chah chauke or aath chakke shaamil the
 On the other hand, during his 76-run innings, Gambhir faced 12 balls and hit 12 fours

 sunwaayee ke dauraan shriramjenmabhumi punaroddhar samiti ke vakil pien mishra ne haddees ke hawaale se islamic kanoon ke zarie zamin ke kharid or istemaal ke niyamon kaa zikr kiya
 He narrated the sentences between Hazrat Mohammad Sahab, his followers Hazrat Umar, Saeed Bukhari and the Jews
 unhone kaha ki masjid ke liye kai kaayade niyam or buniyadi chize hoti hai
 The conditions of the mosque's land and the building, the waqf owner should be the rightful owner of the land, instead of Azan, the Wazukhana is a must
 kam se kam rojaanaa do baar azaan or namaaz ho
 Be the source of water for the cause
 masjid main ghanti, praani, yaa murtiyon kaa chitra naa hon
 There is no place of worship of any other religion on the plot where the mosque is there
 masjid main koi rihaayash, khaanaa banane kii jagah yani chulhaa vagairah naa ho
 PN Mishra said that there is also evidence of Sita being kitchen at the disputed site
 kabren naa hon
 The one who has to offer prayers masjid kaa rakrakhaav kaa zimmaa kisi or dharm ke log nahin kar sakate
 Ramlala is the deity
 bhakt aate rahe hai
 According to Islam, it is neither a mosque and cannot be prayed there
 pien mishra ne kaha, 'babar ke vanshaj kisi imaarat ke maalik ho sakate hai lekin vah imaarat masjid nahin ho sakati
 Hindus continued to worship there for centuries but Muslims were never alone occupied
 vah imaarat hamaare kabje main thi
 Muslims, being rulers, used to offer namaz there
 1856 se pehle vahaan koi namaaj nahin hoti thi
 Till 1934 there was only a prayer of 'jumme'
 is justise chandrachud ne poocha- kya koi shaasha sarkari yaa apni nijee milkiyat vaali zamin par masjid bana saktaa he? is par pien mishra ne jawaab diya ki mughal kaal main bhi aise vaakyaat hue the
 But the Kazi was replied to the king that after constructing a mosque on the land purchased from his own income, it is also the responsibility of the builder to arrange for his maintenance
 masajid al haram, al aksa or masjid nabavi kaa rukh kaaba kii ore nahin he
 Apart from this, the walls of all the mosques around the world are towards the Kaaba, that is, the prayer of Namazi is towards the Kaaba
 pien mishra ne kaha ki antim baar 16 disambar 1949 ko vahaan namaaz adaa kii gai
 Only then riots occurred and the administration stopped the namaz
 1934 se 1949 ke dauraan masjid vaali imaarat kii chaabi musalamaanon ke paas rahati thi lekin police apane pehre main juma kii namaaz ke liye khulawaati thi or safai hoti iske baad namaaz lekin is par bairangi or sadhu shor machaate or namaaz main khalal padataa jisase tanaav badhata tha
 On the night of 22-23 December, prayers were offered for Zuma but the prayers could not be done
 shri ramajnmabhumi punaroddhar samiti ke vakil piem mishra kii daleelein puri ho gayi to hindu mahabha kii ore se harishankar jain ne bahes shuru kii
 He said that this place remained under the authority of Hindus from the beginning
 azaadi ke baad bhi hamaare adhikaar simit kyon rahen? kyonki yah to 1528 se 1885 tak kahin bhi or kabhi bhi musalamaanon kaa yahaan koi daawa nahin tha
 Martin referred to the place in 1838 with the same quote, furthering Buchanan's research
 us kitaab main bhi hindu puja parikrama kii jaati thi
 No mosque was mentioned then
 trefan thailar ne bhi kisi masjid kaa zikr nahin kiya he
 Surprisingly, the then Muslim historians did not even mention the mosque
 harishankar jain ne daleel di, 'hinduon kaa 1855 se 1950 tak puja paath hota rahaa lekin angrejon ne puja ke adhikaar ko simit kar diya tha
 Even after getting independence and the implementation of the constitution, when Article 25 came into force, we still did not get full right to worship '
 anuchhed 13 kaa hawala dete hue jain ne kaha ki azaadi se pehle chunki hamaara kabza tha to vah barkaraar rahanaa chahie
 The invaders looted and destroyed our shrine
 islam ke mutabik ye lut unke liye maal ke ganimat tha
 Jain quoted Sura: 8 of the Quran, saying that under the guise of religion, the goods received from the war were available to the commander and he distributed it to everyone
 jain ne kaha ki mandir ek baar ban gaya to wo sarvada ke liye mandir hi rahata he
 Rama and Krishna are the cultural heritage of our country
 ye sthapit daleel he ki babar ne mandir todakar masjid kaa rup diya
 The original chapter of the constitution also has a picture of Ram in the third chapter
 ram sanvaidhanik purush bhi hai
 Jain said that Rama was born in the palace in Ayodhya
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki ye to vishwaas kii baat he
 Jain said that this is not true because all texts say this
 hindu mahasabha ke duusare vakil varinder kumaar sharma ne kaha ki jo maang yachika main nahin thi wo faisla kaise kiya?iske baad shiya board kii taraf se daleel shuru kii gai
 MC Dhingra said that in 1936, it was decided to make Shia, Sunni Waqf Board and list of Waqf properties of both started to be made
 1944 main board ke liye adhisuchana jari hui
 That mosque was the property of Shia Waqf
 hamaara mutavalli to shiya tha lekin galati se imam sunni rakh diya
 This is why we lost the case
 record main darj he ki 1949 main mutavalli jacki shiya tha
 The court said that you are not opposing the Hindu side, that is enough
 sijeai ne kaha ki hoicourt main aapaki apil 1946 main khaarij hui or aap 2017 main SLP lekar supreme court aae
 Why so late? On this, the Shia board said that there was a crackdown
 hamaare dastauez or record bhi sunniyon ke paas the
 Dhingra said that our documents were confiscated by Sunni parties
 somvaar se sunni vakf board daleel shuru karegaa
