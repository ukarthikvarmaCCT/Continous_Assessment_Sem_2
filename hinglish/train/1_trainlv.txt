 bharat or srilanka ke bich paanchvaan or antim ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket match khatarnaak pich ke kaaran bich main hi radd kiye jane kii vajah se firozshah kotla maidan par kam se kam ek saal kaa pratibandh lag saktaa he
 This pitch incident led to an embarrassing five-match series in which India won 3–1
 is ghatana se dilli ke vishwa cap 2011 ke maichon ke aayojan par bhi sawalia nishaan lag gaya he
 According to the ICC pitch and outfield monitoring process, for the first time the international venue is suspended from 12 to 24 months on the violation and instructions are given for substantial improvement
 isisi pravaktaa ne kaha ki prakriya shuru ho gayi he or match referi alan hurst agle 12 ghante ke andar apni report saunp denge
 He said, "BCCI will get 14 days to respond and the whole process will take about four months
 usee ke baad dilli par faisla kiya jayega
 "just 12 years earlier, on 25 December 1997, the match played between India and Sri Lanka at the Nehru Stadium in Indore was canceled due to the dangerous pitch, after which the ICC banned the stadium for two years

 nirbhaya cond ke doshiyon ko sajaa-e-maut kab milegi, is baat kaa faisla adaalat ko karnaa he
 But the Tihar Jail Administration has been prepared to hang them
 ab jaise hi adaalat chaaron doshiyon ke khilaaf farm number 42 yani blike warrant jari karegi, vaise hi unhen faansee die jane kii prakriya shuru ho jaaegi
 In the days before any convict is hanged, he is kept in the hanging cell
 phir vahiin se sajayaftaa mujrim apana aakhri safar puraa karata he
 Last conviction of a criminal When the court issues a death warrant, ie a black warrant, against a criminal, it is also written on the time to sentence the prisoner to death
 jis din kaidi ko faansee di jaani hoti he, us din use pahanane ke liye nae kapade die jate hai
 a bath is asked
 chaay bhi poochi jaati he
 Then according to the time written on the black warrant, that prisoner is taken out of the hanging cell
 surakshakarmiyon ke ghere main hota he kaideebahar nikaalane ke baad uske chehre ko kaale kapade se dhak diya jaataa he
 So that he cannot see what is happening around there
 use lene ke liye 12 hathiyaarband surakshakarmi aate hai
 They surround him and walk
 kai baar to maut ke dar se kaidi ke pair tak kaanpane lagate hai
 The security personnel or jail staff then carry the sentenced prisoner on the shoulder and carry him to the gallows
 or vahaan faansee kii karrwai puri kii jaati he
 There is no movement in jail
 When any convicted prisoner is hanged, legal action is not complete until the corpse is taken down
 faansee kii prakiya ke dauraan puri jail ke andar har kaam roak diya jaataa he
 Every prisoner is in his cell and his barrack
 yahaan tak ki jail main koi movement nahin hota
 If you put it in easy words, as the time in jail stops
 har taraf sannata or khamoshi pasar jaati he
 Far from the barrack, the hanging Kothi began to be built in 1945 in Tihar Jail
 13 saal baad 1958 main tihaad ban kar taiyaar hua
 And the prisoners started coming there
 angrejon ke jamaane main hi tihaad ke nakshe main faansee ghar kaa bhi nakshaa banaaya gaya tha
 The hanging house was built according to the same map
 jise ab faansee kothi kehete hai
 This hanging is in a secluded secluded place in Kothi Tihar's jail number three, not far from the prisoners' barracks
 jaane kya hoti he deth cell or faansee kothitihaad kii jail number teen main faansee kothi he, usee building main kul 16 deth cell hai
 Death cell is the place where only those prisoners who are sentenced to death are kept
 deth cell main kaidi ko akelaa rakhaa jaataa he
 He is taken out for only half an hour in 24 hours, that too for a walk
 TSP ke paas he suraksha kaa jimmadeth cell kii paharedaari tamilnadu special police (TSP) karti he
 In a two-hour shift, they only work to keep an eye on the prisoners sentenced to death
 taaki wo khudakushi karne kii koshish naa kare
 That is why prisoners of the death cell are not allowed to wear pajamas even if they leave anything else
 desh ke gunaahagaadab puure desh ko nirbhaya cond ke chaaron gunaahagaaron ko faansee par latakaae jane kaa intjaar he
 The countdown of which has started
 adaalat jaise hi blike warrant jari karengi, nirbhaya cond ko anjaam dene vaale darindon mukesh, vinay, pawan or akshay ko faansee ke fande par lataka diya jayega
 China has not made any intrusions into Indian territory
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne loksabhaa main shuukravaar ko yah jaankaree di
 In his written reply, the Defense Minister said that due to the difference in perception of Line of Actual Control (LAC), there are frequent encroachments
 vaastavik rekha nirdhaarit nahin hone se atikaramanparrikar ne kaha ki bharat ourchin ke bichvastavik niyantran rekha saamaanya taur par nirdhaarit nahin he

 The court rejected the person's claim that she was free from any liability because there was an agreement between her and the child's mother that once she received the sum of Rs 50,000 she would not raise any relationship issues
 
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish anuraadhaa shukla bharadwaj ko magistrate kii adaalat ke faisle main koi khami najar nahin ai jisane bachche kii dekhbhaal ke liye siarpisi kii dhara 125 ke tahat do hajaar rupee prati maheene bhugtan karne kaa aadesh is vyakti ko diya tha

 ’ 'missed Calls' - When i first saw Hindi of 'missed call' on a mobile set, i was a little surprised
 chhuti hui kaale, yani ve kol, jise aap samay par uthaa nahin sake
 But now you can leave your membership there by giving a missed call to any political party
 aap uske liye chute hue graahak nahin rahenge, balki sadsy ban jaayenge
 a missed call is an English sentence, also a thought
 iskaa istamaal avasar ganvaa dene ke arth main bhi hota he
 Missed the bus
 hindi main bhi mauka ganvaa dene ke anek muhaavarey hai
 Missed call facility is available in all phones, but it is more popularized by Indians as a means of cheap communication
 mobile phone ne missd kol ko na sirf paise bachaane kaa madhyam banaaya, balki iske zariye samvaad ho jaataa he
 a missed call also means that the work is done
 udhar se phone karne kii zarurat nahin he
 Missed calls also mean that they have reached where they were intended to be
 is tarah ke anek istemaal hai
 Political parties have come up with the idea of gaining membership through it
 janvari, 2014 main aam aadmi party ne dilli vidhansabha chunaav main mili kamyaabi ke baad missd kol ke jariye sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The party's target was to have one crore members by 26 January
 aisa kar party akhil bhartiya upasthiti darj karana chaahati thi
 The campaign was named as 'main Aam Aadmi' and membership was absolutely free
 party ne 10 rupee kaa sadsyta shulk hataa diya tha
 Arvind Kejriwal had said that the common man cannot give 10 rupees, so we are freeing it
 tab is maukey par party netaa gopal raay ne daawa kiya tha ki bharat ke itihaas main pehali baar ho rahaa he, jab koi party apni sadsyta ke darvaaze is tarah se khol rahi he
 Anyone could be a member of the Aam Aadmi Party by giving a missed call on 07798220033
 esemes ke jariye apana naam, vidhansabha kaa naam or astidi code dekar sadsy ho saktaa he
 Then there were also reports that Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi have also become members of the Aam Aadmi Party
 mazaaq ke taur par hi sahi, lekin tab kuch logon ne kaha tha ki missd kol se jo sadsy banegaa, us sadsyta kaa kya matlab he
 Membership is distributed free of cost, such as sale in Delhi in the months of February and August
 kisi party kaa sadsy hona itnaa aasaan ho gaya ki koi niyam-kanoon nahin, vichaardhaara kaa prachaar yaa sangyaan nahin, bas missd kol dijie or ban jaaie party kaa member
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party had claimed that one can become a member by filling the online form
 jinke paas mobile phone nahin he, ve apane voter ycard kaa number dekar sadsy ban sakate the
 Then Arun Jaitley in his blog called it 'gimmick', ie Prapancha, and said that such 'gimmick' does not have far-reaching effects
 bijepi ne bhi 1 november se missd kol se abhiyaan shuru kiya he
 Anyone can become a member of the BJP by giving a missed call to the number 1800 266 2020
 iconomic times main bhaavana vij aroda ne likhaa he ki bijepi duniya kii sabase badi party bananaa chaahati he
 For this, the party has set a target of creating nine crore members by March 2015
 china kii communist party ke aath karod sadsy hai
 The BJP also wants to get ahead of that
 yah saaf nahin he ki china se badi party banakar bijepi kya sabit karnaa chaahati he
 Power in China does not change according to the party, only the leader changes
 china main 1949 se lekar aaj tak communist party of china kaa hi shashan he
 There are also eight more parties to say, which are legally recognized
 bijepi kaa aisa makasad he yaa nahin, abhi saaf nahin he
 The BJP had three and a half crore members before the campaign
 bijepi ne apane abhiyaan ke pehle hi maheene main ek karod missd kol vaale sadsy bana liye hai
 To set a target of nine crore, the BJP will have to create eight crore members in the next four months, i
e
 two crore every month
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 17 karod se zyada vot mili the
 More than 93 crore people in India have mobile sets, so 9 million missed calls are not an impossible target
 bijepi ke liye yah abhiyaan kaaphi gambhir he
 The party's website has promotional videos and audio in many languages for it
 gali-gali main poster lage hai or radio par khub vigyaapan aa rahe hai
 In one such advertisement, a Sikh youth is telling the youth, "modi ji is changing the country
" 
 
 or ham kya kar rahe hai
 
 
 Like them, commenting
 
 
 main ja rahaa hum desh badalane
 
 
 Join BJP, and AAP
 
 
 " yahi like-coment karne vaali jamaat he, jise bijepi or aam aadmi party ne apni raajnneetik puunji ke rup main dekha he
 Now a kind of shame is being sent to this group that you are just commenting
 desh badalanaa he to bijepi se judana hoga
 No advertising agency will have the expertise and thought that our political parties have in the matter of dialogue
 ek or badlaav aayaa he
 Narendra Modi has made the number dominant in the terminology of politics
 number kaa istemaal karne se hasil bada lagane lagata he
 Otherwise, the Aam Aadmi Party thought at first that membership could be made through a missed call, but Narendra Modi made it more attractive by taking it to the number scale
 bijepi ko nau karod sadsy chahie, taaki vah china kii communist party se bhi badi party ban jaae
 The history of political membership in our country will not be more than a hundred years
 gandhi ne congress ke liye chaar aane kii sadsyta nirdhaarit kii thi
 There were many conditions as well
 varsh 2006 main 'telegraph' akhbaar main ek lekh chapa, jisamen kaha gaya ki arjuna singh ko pataa tha ki sonia gandhi congress kii chaar aana sadsy bhi nahin thim, praathmik sadsy bhi nahin thim
 Membership in Congress was of two types - primary and active
 praathmik sadsy hi aage chalakar sakriy sadsy hota tha
 Provided he has made 25 more members and worked for the party for two consecutive years
 varsh 2010 main congress ne is niyam ko badal diya or do charnon kii sadsyta pranali samaapt kar di
 Hindu newspaper reports state that the Congress party in Kerala started a membership campaign from this August, which is running till December 31, but the campaign is not from a missed call
 akhbaar ke anusaar congress ke netaaon ko ghar-ghar jaakar sadsy banane honge
 Similarly, in the initial phase, there will be a similar membership process of the BJP or other parties, where there will be a special meaning to take membership
 bijepi kii website par sadsyta vaale kollam ko clic karne par ek puraa parchaa bhi khulata he, jisamen party kii yatra se lekar siddhanton tak ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 It enumerates the punishments for those who are members of the BJP - nationalism and national integrated democracy, Gandhian attitude towards social and economic problems, establishment of an equitable exploitation-free society, positive secularism, politics based on values - but where is the missed call Will read vah to bas samarthak se sadsy ban jayega
 But the arrival of missed calls in terms of membership is telling that our political parties are changing
 25 sadsy banane kaa formula kuch vaisaa hi he, jaise pradhanmantri narendra modi safai abhiyaan ke liye nau sadasyon ko manonith karte hai, or ve nau sadsy aage nau-nau ko manonith karte hai
 On this formula, a few years ago a postcard printed in the name of Santoshi Mata or Vaishno Devi used to say that if 25 or 50 people were not sent, then the mother would have to become angry
 kaaryakarta or missd kol se bane sadsy main kya antar he, yah to in dalon ko hi saaf karnaa hoga
 On Sunday, Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi gave a statement regarding Ramdev
 unhone kaha ki baba ramdev bijepi ke chavaniya sadsy bhi nahin hai
 In Patna, Modi said that Ramdev is not even a primary member of BJP, then how can his words be put in bjp's account
 susheel modi se patrakaron ne sawaal kiya tha ki ramdev ne kaha tha ki 100 din main kaala dhan aa jayega
 Now it is also not clear whether missed calls are becoming primary members
 unki sadsyta bijepi ko lekar kis prakaar kaa adhikaar detii he
 What kind of rights they get within the BJP from membership is also not clear
 bhavishya main in sadasyon ke aacharan ke prati bijepi kaa kya stand hoga
 Will the party dismiss them as convenient as Sushil Modi did to Ramdev
 missd kol kii sadsyta ke bare main samaj saaf honi chahie
 Will members with missed calls have an opportunity to vote in the party's internal elections
 agar ve party se kisi tarah naaraaz hue to missd kol se lee hui sadsyta kaise waapas karenge
 Will he become a member forever by giving a missed call once
 kai log hote kisi or dal ke sadsy hai, lekin kisi or dal ke netaa se prabhavit hokar duusare dal ko vot kar dete hai
 If someone from a single phone becomes a member by giving a missed call to the bjp's toll free number and from the same Aam Aadmi Party, then it will be separated from which software soup or sieve
 missd kol kii sadsyta ko lekar kai sawaal hai
 What to know, one day also get the answer

 In some states, the results of the latest round of the recent assembly elections were also reflected in it
 sushasan ko in rajyon kii janata ne dil kholkar inaam diya
 On the other hand, leaders associated with a government considered to be an ineffective type at the Center were badly hit

 udghaatan bhaashan main india today ke chairman or pradhan sampadak arun puri ne kaha ki desh main khaas taur par yuva varg main badlaav ke liye tagdi bechaini he
 The result was that the change in states quietly took shape
 unka kahana tha, ''purvottar ke simavarti rajyon se lekar pashchimi ghat tak, dakshini tat se lekar himalay tak sabase acha karke dikhaane vaale har jagah maujuud hai
 Together these states have kept alive the concept of India in which we all have believed
 yani ki ek global agua, jo aarthik shakti sampann bhi ho or saamaajik nyaay main bhi badi takat ho
 "he also said that on the contrary, more money has been lost in scams than the central government has used in projects
 aayojan ke mukhya atithi kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh bade hi sahaj andaaj main the or jaise tay karke aae the ki kisi jaal main nahin fansenge
 Instead, he lauded the year-round survey of states 'condition and direction' in an impartial manner and said that every state has some success story from which other states can learn
 unka kahana tha ki gujarat kaa aarthik model acha he, to kerala ne swasthya or shiksha jaise saamaajik sanketakon main jabardast tarakkee kii he or tamilnadu ne aarthik vruddhi ko saamaajik vikaas se joda he

" ab to satta kii lagaam na sirf rajyon balki sthaneey nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ke haath main deni hogi

 Some people attribute the unnecessary emphasis on populist schemes to the Congress's poor performance in the recent assembly elections
 jabaki duusari ore bhaajapa vikaas ko praathamikta de rahi he
 Starting the debate, Jairam Ramesh, while disagreeing on the use of the term populist, said that everyone has an opinion on the importance of welfare schemes
 unka kahana tha ki ''log akasar kisi kadak rajaneta kii taraf yah sochakar aakarshith ho jate hai ki vah loklubhaavan raajnneeti nahin karegaa
 But it is very unlikely that the new leader can cancel the welfare schemes of the previous government
 misaal ke taur par mujhe is baat se bahut hairaani hogi, agar rajasthan kii nai mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje muft dawa dene kii ashok gahalot kii yojana band kar detii hai
 In Parrikar and Reddy's view, the larger issue of debate was the use of good governance to effectively implement welfare schemes
 parrikar ne kaha ki ''gaiyr chunavi saal main aisi yojanaayen banaai ja sakati hai, jo sirf vot na dilaaein balki lambey samay tak saamaajik vikaas ke liye hon
 In 2002, for instance, the Goa government had started a plan to directly transfer cash into the account
 rajya ke saamne chunauti yah pataa lagane kii he ki paisa labhaarthi tak pahunch rahaa he yaa nahin
 "andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy agreed with this and said that first the objective of the scheme should be assessed and the full data of the people to whom benefits should be given
 unka kahana tha ki ''sabhi yojanaon ko loklubhaavan nahin kaha ja saktaa
 “empowering local bodies can be a way of effective implementation of schemes

 One of the many films released this Friday is also a horror film, titled 'dobara'
 yah film angreji film ‘oculus’ kii oficial hindi rimek he
 The film has been directed by Praval Raman, who has previously directed films like 'darna Mana' and 'darna Must'
 film ke kalakaaron kii baat karen to isamen huma kuraishi pehali baar apane sage bhai saaqib ke saath najar aa rahi hai
 Along with these two, Adil Hussain, Lisa Ray and Riya Chakraborty are also seen in the film
 film kii kahani main natasha marchet yani huma or kabir marchet yani saaqib bhai bahan hai or landan main rahete hai
 The two separated 11 years ago, but years later, the siblings then reunite to solve the mystery of their mother's murder
 unki maa kii hatya ke peeche haath he ek shishe kaa kyonki is shishe main supernetural power hai
 Both of them will have to face the supernatural powers of the same glass to solve all the knots
 lekin aakhir yah kaam ye donon bhai bahan kaise karenge, kya unki maa kii hatya kii gutthi sulajh paayegi or kaise karenge vah supernetural power kaa saamana yah dekhne ke liye to aapako cinemagharon kaa rukh karnaa hoga
 The comments film kii khaamiyon kii baat karen to sabase pehle baat aati he iske screenple kii
 Many scenes of the film look alike, ie the scenes start repeating and this slows down the speed of the film
 jaahir he isse aapako thodi boriyat ho sakati he
 i also felt a little lightness in filming some scenes and due to which i can say that director coral needed to rein in and tighten the direction
 in sabake alaava mujhe lagata he kii dialogs par or dhyaan dene kii zarurat thi kyonki dialogs main wo dhar nahin he or vah halke sabit hue hai
 Talking about the merits of the film, special effects and background scores are the most important in such films, because to create an atmosphere of fear in any horror film, both of them must be the best
 jahaan tak is horer film kii baat he to yahaan special effects achche hai
 Also i would like to compliment the cinematography background score, which is quite good
 acting kii baat karen to saaqib kaa kaam acha he or wo aapako apane abhinay se prabhavit karenge
 At the same time, Adil Hussain is also seen acting strongly
 huma apane kirdaar main thik hai par shaayad unhen thodi or mehnat kii zarurat thi
 This film from my side 2
 5 stars
 In the film's story, Natasha Marchett means Huma and Kabir Merchant is Saqib siblings and lives in London
 yah donon 11 saal pehle alag ho gaye the, lekin saalon baad yah bhai-bahan phir apni maa kii hatya kii gutthi sulajhane ke liye phir se milte hai
 His mother's assassination is behind a mirror because this glass has supernatural power
 sabhi gutthiyon ko sulajhane ke liye in donon ko isi shishe kii supernetural powers kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 But after all how will these two siblings do it, will they solve the murder of their mother and how will they face supernatural power, then you have to go to theaters to see it
 tippaniyan Talking about the shortcomings of the film, the first thing comes to the screenplay
 film ke kai seens ek jaise najar aate hai yani drishy ripet hote lagate hai or isse film kii speed dhimi pad jaati he
 Obviously this can cause you some boredom
 kuch drishyon ke filmakan main bhi mujhe thodaa halkaapan laga or jisaki vajah se main kah saktaa hum kii nirdeshak pravaal ko nirdesan kii lagaam or kasne kii zarurat thi
 Apart from all this, i feel that the dialogues needed more attention because the dialogues do not have that edge and have proved to be light
 film kii khoobiyon kii charchaa karen to is tarah kii filmon me sabase ahm hote hai special effects or becoground score kyonki kisi bhi horer film main dar kaa maahaul rachane ke liye in donon kaa hi behtareen hona jaruri he
 As far as this horror film is concerned, the special effects here are good
 saath hi main tarif karnaa chaahunga cinemetography kii becoground score kii, jo kaaphi achche hai
 Talking about acting, Saqib's work is good and he will impress you with his acting
 vahiin adil hossain bhi damdaar abhinay karte najar aate hai
 Huma is fine in her role but perhaps she needed some more effort
 meri taraf se is film ko 2

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that everyone has heard Chidambaram's statement of sprinkling salt on the wounds of the common man and he cannot be exonerated by accusing the media that he did not understand the context of his talk
 unhone sonia se kaha, ‘samprag sarkaar ke mantri jaanboojh kar baar-baar aam aadmi or madhyam varg ke jakhmon par namak chhidakane vaale bayaan de rahe hai
 But why are you silent even after seeing all this

 He said that Sadhvi Pragya has worn saffron after wearing T-shirt and jeans
 unhone kaha, pragna thakur ne kai logon ke saath budtamiji kii he, isliye vah sadhvi nahin balki adatan apradhi hai
 Pragya, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast, is currently out on bail and is contesting against Congress leader Digvijay Singh

 Baghel continued, "how many people Pragya has spoken in the language of slippers and he also stabbed a man
" bilaigarh kaa har shaks jaanata he ki vah shuruyaat se adatan apradhi rahi hai
 Targeting Sadhvi, Baghel said, "later he started wearing saffron but wearing it does not make him a sadhvi
" unka vyavhaar sadhvi kii tarah nahin lagata
 But when Baghel was asked what is the status of Pragya's stabbing case, he did not respond
 baghel ke is bayaan par madhya pradesh bhaajapa ke pravaktaa hitesh bajpei ne kaha ki chhattisgarh ke siem kaa bayaan ashobhaneey, sharmnaak or jhootha he
 This is not the first time that Baghel has attacked Sadhvi

 sadhvi ne kaha tha ki ram ke mandir par apshisht padaarth the, jinhen hamane hataa diya or unhen babari masjid giraayi jane par garv he
 Sadhvi had said that she would soon build a grand temple of Rama in Ayodhya
 unke is bayaan par chunaav ayog ne unhen notice bhi jari kar aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 After this, Sadhvi in sehore called Digvijay Singh a terrorist
 bayaan main sadhvi ne kaha tha, 16 saal pehle uma bharti ne haraaya tha or vah 16 saal tak munh nahin uthaa paaya
 Now raising the head again, another monk is in front, which is a direct proof of his deeds
 sadhvi ne kaha tha ki aise aatanki ko khatm karne ke liye phir sanyasi ko khadaa hona pad rahaa he

 raaj thakare ke netritv vaali manase ke hisse main nau siten ain jabaki congress or rakanpa teen-teen siton ke saath chauthe sthaan par raheen
 Despite being an ally in the state government, the BJP and Shiv Sena broke their ties between each other over the never-ending scandal on various issues before the civic elections in these two cities
 trephic rule todane vaale ko gulab ke phool bhent karne jaisi ‘gandhigiri’ kii tamaam ghatnaayen aapane pehle suni hongi
 But the specimen of 'collective Gandhigiri' in Bihar is very interesting
 rajya sarkaar kii ore se training paa rahe nae teacher jab class main let pahunchate hai, to kuch jagahon par unka swaagat joardaar taaliyon se saath kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there is a large-scale recruitment of TET pass teachers in the state, who are given 30-30 days of special training (prerna-2) in the group
 jis centre par aisi training di jaati he, use BRC (block Resource Centre) kehete hai
 All teachers have to arrive on time for training
 jab training paane vaale koi shikshak class main der se pahunchate hai, to baaki shikshak unka swaagat taaliyaan bajaakar karte hai
 Such applause is called 'teen Tali' here
 aisi taaliyaan bajaane kaa makasad yah hota he ki let pahunchane vaale ko is baat kaa ehsaas ho jaae ki usne tay vakt par na aakar galati kii he
 Also, the mistakes should be made in such a way that nobody gets hurt in the mind
 is bare main sankul sansaadhan centre (cluster Resource Centre) kanya madhya vidhyalay, maner ke koordinator madhurendra kumaar ‘madhup’ ne bataaya, ‘aam taur par lunch time khatm hone par kamare se baahar gaye shikshakon ko andar bulaane ke liye lagaataar taaliyaan bajaai jaati hai, jise sunakar ve turant laut jate hai
 The practice of clapping when late is not everywhere
 ’unhone bataaya ki lunch khatm hone par bel kii bajaae is tarah kii taaliyaan bajaai jaati hai
 Also, during training, they are greeted with 'five applause' on some special achievement or when a very special guest arrives at the center
 aisi sabhi taaliyon ko bieepi (bihar Education Project) kii tali kaha jaataa he
 Another interesting thing is that if someone makes a mistake by losing their rhythm in order to collectively clap, then they have to recite the song, latifa or some motivational theme as a 'bonus'
 let aane waalon ko bhi isi tarah ‘dandit’ kiya jaataa he
 Ramashankar Gupta, Coordinator of Cluster Resource Center, Middle School, Gopalpur, said, "teachers who are responsible for teaching discipline to children and building their character can only be expected to be punctual
 agar teacher khud let-latif honge, to bachche unase kya seekhenge
 'he said that no one feels offended by the kind of' welcome 'that occurs when he is late, and the' message 'from the applause also reaches the wrongdoer
 baharhaal, ghanti ke vikalp ke rup main taaliyon kaa istemaal or let aane par taaliyon se swaagat kii aisi misaal shaayad hi kahin or dekhne ko mili

 According to sources, in the Congress Core Committee meeting, it was decided that some of Anna's demands could be included in the current Lokpal bill as an amendment

 Apart from this, all government employees can also come under the purview of Lokpal

 in ilaakon main bijepi un votaron kii khinchne kii ranneeti main jute gai jo paramparaagat rup se congress or basapa se jude the
 Before voting, the BJP raised the issue of 'cremation and graveyard'
 khud piem modi ne chunavi sabha ke dauraan akhilesh sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jab ramajaan main 24 ghante bijli mil sakati he to phir diwali par bhi 24 ghante bijli milani chahie
 The BJP made a polarization move and then the issue of development, corruption disappeared
 jabaki 'shmashaan or kabristaan' par chunaav bhaashanon main tik gaya
 Fifth stage: In the 'donkey' speech, issues are missing
 The 5th phase is being voted on today (monday) in 51 seats in 11 districts including Amethi
 pehle chaar charnon ke matdaan main siton ke ank ganit main phisalane kii khabar se chintit bhaajapa ne bache teen charnon ke liye puri takat lagane or sangh ke sahyog se bache teen charnon main puraa dam lagane kii ranneeti tay kii he
 At the same time, Akhilesh turned his entire focus on the 'donkey' statement
 piem paanchaven charan ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan har sabhaaon main akhilesh is bayaan ko lekar palatwaar kaa mauka nahin choda
 At the same time, Amit Shah gave a new definition of 'kasab' i
e
 a-congress, C-SP, B-BSP
 bataa den, bhaajapa bhale hi pehle chaar charnon kii 262 siton main se 175 siten jeetne kaa daawa kar rahi ho lekin sangh ke jamini kaaryakartaaon kii or se sangh ko chaar charnon ke chunaavon ke baad jo jamini report sangh ne apane kaaryakartaaon se ekatrit kar bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv ko bheji he
 It has become a cause of concern for the BJP
 bhaajapa mukhyalay pahunchi khabar main kaha gaya he ki chaar charnon ke chunaav ke baad bhaajapa bamushkil 75 siton ke aasapaas simat sakati he
 The ground workers of the BJP also sent an estimate of 75 to 80 seats in the report sent to the BJP high command
 jamini report se aa rahe feedback ne bhaajapa kii chin ta ko badha diya or daud main bane rahane or satta paane ke liye bhaajapa ne bache hue teen charnon ke liye aakraamak chunaav abhiyaan apnaane, sangh kaa puraa sahyog lene or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii relia badhaane kii ranneeti tay kii he
 After the fourth phase of the focus on grassroots workers, the booth management of the grassroots workers of the Sangh and the voters were entrusted with the task of taking them out of the house to vote
 sangh kaa apane basti, mohalla, nagar str se lekar praant or kshetra ke padaadhikaariyon ko bhaajapa ke paksh main maahaul banane kaa nirdesh
 At the same time, the focus was also on increasing PM Modi's rallies
 vahiin upi main baaki do charnon ke chunaav prachaar charam par he
 In the sixth phase, voting will be held on March 4 in 49 seats of Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia districts

 While in the seventh and final phase, voting will be held on March 8 in 40 seats of Ghazipur, Varanasi, Chandauli, Mirzapur, Bhadohi, Sonbhadra, Jaunpur districts
 2012 ke chunaav main yahaan se samaajawaadee party ko 23, bhaajapa ko 4, congress ko 3 or basapa ko 5 siten mili thi
 In the remaining two phases, the BJP is directly targeting the Akhilesh government along with regional issues
 saath hi akhilesh ke gadhaa bayaan ko lekar bhi chhod nahin rahi he
 Amit Shah himself is reviewing the election strategy every day and issues are being raised according to the region

 rajasthan ke barmer main doda post kharidne pahunchi setu devi dukaan band padi dekh fat padati hai
 She says, "our life has become miserable
 doda na milane se mere pati or ladakon kii haalat kharaab he or ve kaam par nahin ja paa rahe hai
 "his talk can be gauged by his passion for Doda Posta
" pashchimi rajasthan main doda post kii dukaanon par rojaanaa kii lambii kataren is sach ko or numaayan karti hai
 Alam is such that due to non-availability of Doda, people have started committing uproar and highway jam
 vidambnaa hi he ki ek ore centre sarkaar vishwa swasthya sanghathan kii guideline ke mutabik or uske dabaav main doda post jaisi nashili vastuon ko hatotsahit karne ke liye unki kheti ke rakabe main saal-dar-saal kami kar rahi he jabaki iske vipareet doda post or opium kaa seven karne waalon kii sankhya main oochaal aayaa he
 Interestingly, according to the state government in western Rajasthan, only 7,247 people have got their permits, while their number is far more
 doda post kii uplabdhta main baari kami ne aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya he
 Government supply of Doda Posta is also not complete
 uske na milane se log nashe ke injectionon kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 Two persons allegedly committed suicide even when the intoxication was unbearable
 pashchimi rajasthan ke kai jilon main aisa hi haal he
 Hundreds of people blocked the highway in Barmer last week
 ye sabhi doda post kii aapurti karne, sabhi kaa license banane yaa license kaa niyam khatm karne kii maang kar rahe the
 On the other hand, in Jaisalmer district also, due to lack of doda poppy, the anger of the troubled people was aroused
 ek nashedi farsa ram ne bataaya, ''doda kii kami kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki ghar kii mahilaon ko ab sadakon par utarana pad rahaa he
 Fusaram, an addict from Barmer, said, "people are now resorting to drug injection because of not getting doda
" ''barmer ke shiv se vidhayak maanavendra singh ne doda post ke sankat ke liye centre sarkaar ko jimmedaar bataaya
 He told, "the main reason for this is the decrease in the yield of doda poppy
 '' 2011-12 main chittorgadh or pratapgarh jile ke andar kul 20,372 kaashtkaaron ko 9,491
 Leases were issued by the central government to cultivate doda poppy in an area of 30 hectares
 lekin 2012-13 main sirf 18,351 kaashtkaaron ko 2445
 Leases were issued on 40 hectares
 lihaaja 2012-13 main iskaa utpaadan 75 fisadi kam hua
 Additional Excise Commissioner of Jodhpur Division b
 aar
 Delu admitted that the government was reducing the lease every year for the cultivation of doda poppy
 unhone bataaya ki rajya sarkaar ne 2001 ke baad koi bhi nayaa permit jari nahin kiya he
 The permits issued also include many people who have died and after 2-3 years, the permits of those who did not renew the permits have been rejected
 delu bataate hai ki jodhpur sambhag main barmer main 22, jaisalmer main 8, jalaur main 11, paali main 11, sirohi main 6 or jodhpur main 17 doda post bikri kii dukaane hai lekin inhen permitdhaariyon ke mutabik hi uski aapurti ho rahi he
 Despite the uproar, the government is not looking serious

 jila parishad ke dipti meyar pad par behalabajat satr main mukhyamantri ne kii thi tariftelugana main kuch hi maheenon pehle ek mahila van adhikari par samarthakon ke saath hamalaa karne vaale sattadhari party ke netaa ko apane pad par phir se behaal kar diya gaya he
 India Today aired a video of the attack on June 30, after which the entire nation was stunned
 telugana ke sirpur kagaznagar main van adhikari anita apni team ke saath vriksharopan karvaa rahi thim, tabhi sthaneey vidhayak konaru conppa ke bhai konaru krishna ne apane samarthakon ke saath un par lathi, dandon or bans sehamla kiya tha
 Anita had suffered a lot of injuries, she was hospitalized
 ab usase bhi zyada stabdh karne vaala nirnay saamne aayaa he
 Accused Konaru Krishna has been reinstated to the post of deputy chairman of the Zilla Parishad
 konaru krishna telugana main telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) ke vidhayak konaru conppa ke bhai hai
 At the time of the attack on the female officer, he was the deputy chairman of the Zilla Parishad
 kyon hue the giraftaar?hamale ke baad unke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya tha or samarthakon ke saath unhen giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Even Union Minister Prakash Javadekar condemned the attack
 us samay dabaav ke chalate krishna ko pad se bhi hatana padaa tha
 However, after this attack, Telangana Chief Minister and TRS President k Chandrasekhar Rao took silence instead of reacting
 yahaan t k ki unhone jakhmi haalat main aspataal main bhartee adhikari se bhi na baat kii or na hi aspataal jaakar mulaakaat kii, jabaki aspataal unke awaas se kuch hi kilometre kii duuri par tha
 The chief minister's praise was the most surprising thing that during the budget session of the assembly, Chief Minister Rao openly praised MLA Konaru Konappa and his brother
 bajet satr ke dauraan van bhoomi par charchaa karte hue mukhyamantri chandrashekhar raav ne kaha tha ki main praja darbar lagaaungaa or sachai kaa pataa karuunga
 There have been some unfortunate incidents
 unhone kaha tha ki maine van prashasan or vidhayak se kaha he kividhayak ke bhai achche aadmi hai, bure aadmi nahin hai
 He won the district council election by an overwhelming majority
 ve adivaasiyon or unke adhikaron ke liye prashasan ke saamne khadey rahe lekin unheen ke khilaaf cese darj hue
 it saddens me
 van vibhaag ke adhikariyon main aakroshhamale ke baad van adhikariyon ne vidhayak or unke bhai ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha
 There is anger among the forest officials for the statement of the Chief Minister on this incident and now the return of the accused leader
 gauratlab he ki peedit adhikari anitha, jo ki hamale ke samay duty par thim or unke khilaaf bhi cese darj kiya gaya tha
 The mla's brother and his supporters had accused Anito of SC / ST harassment and abetment to suicide
 bollywood filmon main aksar dekha gaya he ki agar heroin ke saath koi bevafaayee karata he to doosraa hero yaa to use sahaara detaa he yaa phir us bande ko tabah karne ke liye ji-jaan se jute jaataa he
 In the coming days, Bollywood will see something similar
 jahaan salmaan khan apni dostkatrina kaifaka badla box offis par ranbir kapur se lete najar aaenge
 Reason: Some time back the market was hot due to the news of their love affair and the pages of the newspaper were buzzing and the news was getting tremendous response on the websites
 lekin prem kii is jananath main filmon se judi naakaami rupi saanp ne apni jagah bana lee or donon premiyon kii raahen juda ho gayi
 Katrina Kaif again remembered her old friend and friend Salman Khan also went ahead and supported them and expressed friendship openly
 salmaan ne katrinako sahaara hi nahin diya, balki'ek tha tiger' ke sikval 'tiger jinda he'main unhen role bhi dilaa diya
 The funny thing is that Salman Khan, who always crosses his eyes with the help of festivals, chose the Christmas week of 2017 for the release of his film
 yahi vah haftaa he jis din ranbir kapur kii sanjay dutt kii jindagi par aadhaarit byopic ko relies kiya janaa he (abhi tak kii khabaron ke mutabik)
 Anyway, Salman has been keeping distance from Sanjay ever since the talk of Ranbir Kapoor playing the role of Sanjay Dutt
 pehle donon hi kalakaaron main jabardast bromance dekhne ko miltaa tha jo sanjay ke jail se aane ke baad ekadam hawa he
 Now this could also be Salman's intention to shoot two birds with one stone as he has been targeting many people in Bollywood, and this time he intends to hit two people through one of his films
 dekhnaa yah bhi he ki rajkumaar hiraani kii filmon kaa record jabardast rahaa he
 In such a situation, Rajkumar advances his film date or intends to get involved with Salman
 salmaan ek baar jo soch lete hai vah karke hi dikhaate hai kyonki vah apane jigari dost shahrukh khan kii'rais'ko pehle hi dar-badar kar chuke hai or esaaarake apni is film ko bachaane kii har koshish main jute hai
 Bad timing hunters should be smart as Salman Khan may also intend to equalize the Katrina episode with Dhobi beating him at the box office
 isliye hamen to salmaan khan ko lekar police ke bare main kahi jane vaali yahi kahawat dhyaan main aati he, 'na inaki dosti bhalee na dushmani

 soochna ke adhikaar kanoon yani artiai se mili jaankaree bataati he ki ames main bhrashtachar ujagar karne vaale afasar sanjeev chaturvedi ko pratadit karne kaa silsilaa jari he
 The central government has neither given him any work, nor is he being transferred to the Delhi government, as demanded by Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 artiai se mili jaankaree bataati he ki chaturvedi ke dilli sarkaar main tabadale kii file lambey vakt se khud mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke paas he or us par kuch nahin ho rahaa
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought Sanjeev Chaturvedi as OSD on February 16, but the central government has not relieved Chaturvedi even after more than five weeks have elapsed
 1 march ko khud kejariwal ne media main bayaan diya tha, jisamen unhone kaha tha, "chaturvedi ne ames main bhrashtachar ke kai maamle ujagar kiye hai
 We in the Delhi government are asking him to use his experience, but the central government is neither using Chaturvedi himself nor is giving them to us
 bas unhen sidline karke rakhaa hua he
 " enditivi india ke paas jo dastauez hai, ve bataate hai ki chaturvedi kii file pichley kai dinon se paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke paas he
 On 16 February, the Delhi government demanded the transfer of Chaturvedi
 17 farvari ko prakaash jaavdekar ne media main kaha ki centre sarkaar ko isamen koi dikkat nahin he
 NDTV India, after looking at the file tracking records, revealed that the proceedings to release Chaturvedi began on 18 February
 19 farvari ko mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne file ko sachiv ke paas bheja, lekin jab sachiv ashok lavasa ne 2 taarikh ko ye file waapas mantri ji ke paas bheji, to uske baad se us par kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, the Kejriwal government has been sending reminders to the Center to relieve Chaturvedi
 pichhlaa reminder 28 farvari ko bheja gaya, lekin centre is bare main chup baitha he
 Interestingly, the Delhi government had also sought deputation to officers of Uttar Pradesh and Central Revenue Department, whose transfers have been made immediately
 sawaal ye he ki arvind kejariwal kii file mantri ji ke paas kyon padi hui he, jabaki khud paryaavaran mantri jaavdekar ne media se kaha tha ki chaturvedi ko relive kar diya jayega
 We sent questions to the environment minister about this, but even after trying several times, no answer was given to us
 sawaal isliye bhi uth rahaa he ki nai sarkaar aane ke baad chaturvedi kii us maang par ho rahi kaarywahi ko bhi thande baste main daal diya gaya he, jisamen unhone apana kader haryana se badalakar uttarakhand karne kii maang kii thi
 When i first bought a BMW car a few years ago, i found out that it does not have a stepney
 stepni nahin hoti? matlab? matlab isaki dikky main wo atirikt pahiyaa nahin hota, jo aam taur par sabhi gadiyon main hota he
 And the reasoning behind this was that this vehicle has run flat tires
 ran flats tair kaa matlab aise tair, jo panchar ho jane ke baad bhi kuch dur chal sakate hai
 When BMW cars were launched in India, the company's people did not study the roads here properly
 europe or america main ye gaadiyaan safalataa purvak chal rahi thim, to uski vazah ye thi ki vahaan sadaken kaaphi acchhee hoti hai, or duusari baat ye ki jagah-jagah company ke sarvice centre bhi hote hai
 When i bought a BMW car, i was told that it does not need or need extra tires
 ab stepni nahin hone kaa arth ye to nahin tha ki gaadi panchar hi nahin hogi
 One day the train was punctured
 main gaadi chalaata rahaa
 Ideally, these tires can run up to fifty kilometers after being punctured, but bmw's service station must be fifty kilometers away
 meri gaadi panchar hui, dilli-jaipur ke raste par
 i kept dragging the car, finally the tire broke completely
 raste me kisi tair vaale ke paas meri gaadi kaa ilaaj tab nahin tha
 i will tell you how i got out of that problem, but today that i complained to the company, the company said that i should put a 'donut' tire in the car
 ab donot tair kya hote hai?america main khai jane vaali ek mithai ko donot kehete hai
 It is a round dessert of flour and sugar
 agar jalebi uljhi hui na ho, sirf gol ho, to wo bhi donot kii tarah dikhegi
 The BMW company doing business in India had realized that the roads here could not run without extra tires, so they started selling a thinner tire in the name of donut tire
 yah ek tarah se motor cycle ke tair jaisaa ek tair hota he, jise emrazansi main aap panchar pahie kii jagah laga kar kuch kilometre kii duuri dhire-dhire tay kar sakate hai
 a few kilometers means a few kilometers
 ise laga kar aap na gaadi farrate se chalaa sakate hai, na bahut dur ja sakate hai
 i also bought donut tires
 gaadi main use rakhane kii jagah nahin thi, par maine kisi tarah peeche rakh liya
 Hi Ray Sanjay Sinha's luck! Once on my way to Mathura my car got punctured again
 maine bahut mashkkat se panchar pahiyaa kii jagah donot tair laga diya
 With the help of donut tires, i reached Mathura, but bmw's service center was not found anywhere
 ab ran flats tair kaa kya karun? donot tair se vahaan pahunch to gaya, par vaapasi kaise ho?us din bhi main baari mushkil main padaa
 Run flat tires were not found everywhere, they were also not repaired everywhere
 aise main gaadi to thi, par chal nahin sakati thi
 i will tell the whole story of tire and car again
 aaj to itnaa hi ki main us gaadi se itnaa pareshaan ho gaya tha ki maine gaadi hi badal di
 Well, today i don't want to talk about that
 aaj to main aapse rishton kii stepni kii baat karne ja rahaa hum
 Just yesterday, i came to know that an acquaintance of mine, who lives alone in Delhi, is ill
 main unase milane unke ghar gaya
 She was lying on the bed alone in the room
 ghar main ek naukaraani thi, jo aaraam se drawing room main tivi dekh rahi thi
 When i rang the doorbell, the maid opened the door and she welcomed me in a very warm manner
 aisa laga jaise maine naukaraani ke aaraam main khalal daal di ho
 When i went to the acquaintance's room, she was lying down, looking very weak and broken
 mujhe dekh kar unhone uth kar baithne kii koshish kin
 i put them on the bed with support
 meri parichit chupchaap meri ore dekhati raheen, phir maine poocha ki kya hua? parichit mere itnaa poochne par bilakh padin
 She started saying, 'son is very much lonely in life
 koi mujhase milane bhi nahin aata
 She started crying after saying so
 kehane lageen, 'sanjay betaa, maut bhi nahin aati
 i am tired of lying alone
 puri zindagi vyarth lagane lagi he
 'I remembered that her husband was a high government official
 jab tak wo rahe, inaki zindagi kii gaadi bmadblu ke ran flats tair par puure raftaar se daudti rahi
 He invested in many houses, shops, shares, but not in relationships
 tab inhen lagata tha ki zindagi makaan, dukaan or share se chal jaaegi
 He looked at relatives coming home with a keen eye
 inhen yakeen tha ki zindagi kii dikky main rishton kii stepni kii zarurat nahin
 He had a son and like the sons of all the elders, he too went to America studying in English schools
 ek din pati sansar se chale gaye, meri parichit akeli rah gayi
 What should i go into in greater detail, let me tell you that they have been alone here for the last several years
 kyonki inhone apane ghar main rishton kii stepni kii jagah hi nahin rakhi thi, to inase milane bhi koi nahin aata
 If there is a car now, then there can be puncture
 to ek din inhone naukaraani rupi donot stepni dekhbhaal ke liye rakh lee
 Yesterday when i went to my acquaintance's house, that donut stepney of relationships was watching TV in the drawing room
 meri parichit apane kamare main bistar par kuch aise leti padi thim jaise mathura main apni gaadi ke panchar ho jane ke baad jab tak company se koi gaadi uthaane nahin aayaa, main padaa tha
 It is necessary to have a spare tire in the car, cheap or expensive
 stepni ke bina kitni bhi badi or mahangi gaadi ho, panchar ho gai, to kisi kaam kii nahin rahati
 Whatever happens in life, if you do not have a relationship for happiness and sorrow, then all the beautiful life you have lived, one day it will start to look futile
 uthie, aaj hi apni gaadi kii dikky main jhankie ki vahaan stepni he yaa nahin
 If it is, the air is fine or reduced
 uthie or aaj hi apni zindagi kii dikky main bhi jhankie ki usamen rishton kii stepni he yaa nahin
 If there is love in it or it is reduced
 dhyaan rahe, donot tair ke bharose car kuch kilometre kii hi duuri kar paati he, puraa safar tay karne ke liye to puure pahie kii hi zarurat hoti he

 " argedy ke purv saansad or bahubali netaa shahabuddin kii jamaanat ko lekar bijepi ne bihar sarkaar par ek baar phir nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Former Deputy Chief Minister of the state Sushil Kumar Modi made the disclosure on Tuesday and explained in detail how and under what circumstances Shahabuddin was granted bail
 susheel modi ke mutabik,shahabuddinne siwan ke adije ke yahaan yachika daakhila kar bataaya ki wo behad garib hai or uske paas mukaddama ladane ke liye paise nahin he
 Therefore, a government lawyer should be provided to fight his case
 siwan ke adije ne 18 july 2013 ko shahabuddin kii yachika manjuur karte hue sarkari vakil muhaiyaa karaane kaa aadesh de diya
 But Shahabuddin did not find a qualified lawyer in the panel of government lawyers, so he hired Abhay Kumar Rajan, a lawyer outside the panel, to fight his case
 siwan kii court ne isaki bhi manjuuri de di
 The High Court imposed an injunction on the order of the ADJ, further said, "against this decision of Siwan court, the government approached the Patna High Court and presented it in the court of Shahabuddin's property, saying that the sex service authority's sex Under the law, they cannot be allowed to have a lawyer at the government expense
 is par patna hai court ne adije siwan ke aadesh par tatkaal prabhaav se roak laga di
 Patna High Court also said that its information should be given to Shahabuddin through post
 patna hai court ne apane aadesh main ye bhi likhaa ki shahabuddin ke court main sasharir upasthiti ke baad cese ko soochibaddh kiya jaae
 'could not appear in Shahabuddin's court, accused Kumar Modi that despite Shahabuddin being in jail for the last three years, Shahabuddin was not served the notice of Patna High Court, which resulted in the appearance in Kishabuddin's court
 Could not be found and the case could not be listed
 modi ne kaha ki siwan court ke aadesh par roak, notice kaa tamil naa hona or court main peshi nahin hone ke kaaran siwan court main shahabuddin ke khilaaf saare cese ke trial band pade rahe
 Sushil Modi raised the question, the SAWBJP leader asked the government why Shahabuddin was not served the notice of Patna High Court? Why was Shahabuddin not produced in the court while he was still in Siwan jail? In all the cases against Shahabuddin for three years, why was the trial closed in all cases except two? What efforts did the government make to start the trial? Modi said that out of the cases where the trial is closed, there are many cases in which imprisonment up to death can be awarded
 modi ne kaha ki agar trial main ruke maamle main sajaa mil jaati to shahabuddin ko phir se nichali adaalat se lekar upree adaalat tak jamaanat ke liye janaa pad saktaa tha

 ) The legislators will now find a solution to how to catch dogs and monkeys
 sunne main zarur atapata sa lagegaa lekin ye sach he
 Actually, the problem of dogs and monkeys growing in Delhi is no longer common
 pehle sansad main khud uparashtrapati ne is samasya ko uthaaya tha or ab dilli vidhansabha main bhi bandaron or kutton kii samasya kaa vishay joro par rahaa
 On Friday, about half a dozen mlas in the Delhi Assembly told the House that the number of dogs and monkeys in their area was increasing steadily
 jiske kaaran naa sirf sthaneey logon ko balki khud vidhayakon ko bhi raat ke vaqt ghar se nikalate vakt dar lagata he
 On this subject, the legislators in one opinion, while holding the MCD responsible, also advised the Delhi government to take the responsibility of capturing the Bandar and the dog
 vidhansabha adhyaksh ramanivas goyal ne bhi is vishay par chintaa vyakt kii or dilli vidhansabha main ghatit ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue bataaya ki vidhansabha main bhi bandaron ke aatank ke kaaran ek vyakti kii jaan jate jate bachi
 Considering the seriousness of the subject, the Delhi Assembly has formed a committee of 5 mlas Saurabh Bhardwaj, Alka Lamba, Rajesh Rishi, OP Sharma, to be chaired by Somnath Bharti
 bandaron aurakutton ke kaatane sekai logon kii maut ke maamle bhi kai baar saamne aa chuke hai, vahiin varsh 2007 main tatkaaleen up mahayor eses bajva ko bhi bandaron ke kaaran apni jaan se haath dhone pade the
 The population of people is increasing in Delhi, for whom it is becoming very difficult to find a place to hide their heads, but these mlas are talking about establishing separate mohalla for these dogs

 What is 4D brain mapping? Chairman of Brain Behavior Research Foundation and Dr
 alok kumaar mishra ne apni team ke saath milakar kariyar counselling kii4di brain masping technology ko taiyaar kiya he
 Mind Body Medicine and Brain Mapping Expert Dr
 mishra kehete hai,brain masping keliye vyaktitv ke chaar ayaamon kaa gahanta ke saath vishleshan hota he
 Genetic potential is first assessed
 duusare number par neurological,tisare number par psychological or chauthe number parabiological vishleshan hota he
 Then after analyzing all these dimensions, the antennas are made by putting together the front of your brain, or the brain card is prepared
 genetic kshamta kaa akalan-vaigyanik rup se koi do raay nahin ki hamaare vyaktitv or kshamtaaon kaa ekbada hissaa anuvaanshik hota he
 That is, we have received a lot from our ancestors from generation to generation
 yah viraasat hamaare diene main surakshit rahati he
 Genetic mapping is done first by just checking this DNA
 diene ke bheetar maujuud genetic code ko dicodkar yah pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki aakhir aapke purvajon ne aapako kya kshamta di he
 What does brainwave say? alok mishra kehete hai ki hamaare dimag ke bheetar kai tarah kii tarange hoti hai
 Their number and speed of flow vary from person to person
 jaise dhyaan kii avasthaa main ek khaas tarah keetarang tej hogi to taarkik kaam karte vakt duusare tarah kii tarang bahegi
 The ability to understand our thinking, solve problems and take decisions can also be detected through a certain type of wave speed
 ye tarange har dimag main bahati hai
 But to detect which wave is most effective in which person, a special type of device is the use of electro encephalogram (EEG)
 is puri prakriya ke jariye neurological masping hoti he
 Biological dimension-third analysis gathers information about the effective part of the brain
 jaise dimag do hisson main banta hota he,left or rhite hemisphere
 If the right hemisphere is activated, then you have the capabilities of the art-related field and the left has the capabilities to go to the logical field like mathematics, banking
 psychological aayam-ant main psychological aayam ko jaanane ke liye kuch prashnawaliyaan di jaati hai
 Whose answers are analyzed by explaining what the personality is like, how the environment is around, how your friends are

 lekin4di analysis kaa upyog kar kariyar kaa kaccha nahin balki pakkaa nakshaa banaaya jaasakata he
 Because every person's abilities are a mixture of his genetic, practical, biological and psychological characters

 *** The Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the country's famous professional political strategist Prashant Kishor have joined hands for the Delhi Assembly elections 2020
 yani dilli chunaav main prashanth kishor aam aadmi party ke liye prachaar karenge
 It has been said by the Aam Aadmi Party that Prashant Kishore Volunteer will voluntarily promote the party
 This means that there is no economic deal between the Aam Aadmi Party / Kejriwal government of Delhi and Prashant Kishore
 arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party ke duusare netaa sabhi yah daawa karte hai ki beete paanch saal main kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli main jitne or jis tarah ke kaam kiye hai uske baad unhen is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav 2020 vah jeetne ja rahe hai
 It is not just a matter of saying
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya kii body language or aatmavishvaas dekhakar yah lagata he ki ve keval kehane ke liye nahin kah rahe balki khud bheetar se bhi aashwast hai
 In Punjab too, Prashant Kishore was with the Congress at that time, due to this the Aam Aadmi Party could not come to power there
 isliye ab prashanth kishor ke aam aadmi party ke saath aa jane par atakalein lag rahi hai ki ho saktaa he punjab chunaav main bhi donon saath rahen
 It is also discussed that the party wants to enter the country's largest state of Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections will be held in 2022 along with Punjab
 iske alaava rashtriya raajnneeti main aam aadmi party kaa dakhal tab tak nahin ho saktaa jab tak vah loksabhaa chunaavon main siten na jite
 At present, the Aam Aadmi Party has only one MP in the Lok Sabha
 aam aadmi party sutara dilli se aage kii baat par khulkar to kuch nahin kah rahe lekin yah ishaara jarur kar rahe hai ki 'prashanth kishor se lambey samay se baatcheet chal rahi thi to wo keval dilli ke liye to nahin hogi!'lekin prashanth kishor is samay aupchaarik rup se janata dal united main hai
 But the manner in which he criticized his party's stand on the Citizenship Amendment bill and after the party leaders questioned Prashant Kishore, there is speculation that Prashant Kishore will still remain in the Janata Dal United? The news of joining hands of Kejriwal and Prashant Kishore gives rise to a lot of speculation in itself
 atkal yah ki kya janata dal united chhodkar prashanth kishor aam aadmi party main shaamil honge?aam aadmi party sutara filhal sirf itnaa kah rahe hai ki 'prashanth kishor ke saath hamaara sambandh short turm ke liye nahin long turm ke liye he

 In the event of getting the money (budget) from the Finance Ministry at the right time, it will be able to make major changes in the condition of the railway by 2022
 lekin railway sirf pariyojnaon ke liye hi bajet kii mohataaj nahin he

 Are among the famous students of Patna University
 shatrughna ne kaha ki is bare main unhone in donon se bhi baat kii he or unhone bhi aamantrit nahin kiye jane par aashcharya vyakt kiya he
 Asked whether his name was deliberately not included in the Prime Minister's program due to his outrageous remarks from the party line, Shatrughan said it could happen
 is samaaroh ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke saath rajyapal satyapal malik, mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi, lojpa pramukh ramvilas paswan or kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad manch saajha karenge
 Shatrughan, a student of Science College of Patna University, said that recently vice-chancellor Bihari Singh had come to meet him along with Yashwant Sinha and wanted guidance for the successful conduct of this function
 apane sansadeey nidhi se patna vishvavidhyalay ke collejon main suvidhaayen uplabdh karne vaale shatrughna ne kaha ki ve aashaa karte hai ki pradhanmantri ko is vishvavidhyalayon main shikshakon kii kami or dhanrashi kii kami sahit anya samasyaon se avgat karaayaa jayega
 The comments patna vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati bihari singh ne shatrughna sahit anya ko aamantrit nahin kiye jane kaa koi arth nikaale jane ko sahi nahin tehraate hue kaha ki aamantran patr ke chhapane main vilamb hone ke kaaran unhen bheja nahin ja sakaa, par ve hamaari atithi suchi main shaamil hai

 Governor Satyapal Malik, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will share the dais with the Prime Minister during the ceremony
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke sains college ke chaatr rahe shatrughna ne kaha ki haal main yahaan ke kulapati bihari singh unase milane yashavanth sinha ke saath aae the or is samaaroh ke safal aayojan ke liye maargdarshan chaha tha
 Shatrughan, who provided facilities in Patna University colleges with his parliamentary fund, said that he hoped that the Prime Minister would be made aware of other problems including shortage of teachers and lack of funds in these universities

 At that time it is not difficult to understand what will happen to the CRPF personnel sitting inside the vehicle
 usee hinsak virodh ke dauraan 21 varshiya kaisar mohammad siarpief ke vaahan ke neeche aakar gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya tha
 Kaiser Mohammed died the next day in hospital
 siarpief vaahan main us vakt ek adhikari or driver samet 4 jawan the
 These five, while talking to India Today, believed that anything could have happened that day, that day could also be the last day of their life
 baharhinsak bheedke haath main jo bhi aa rahaa tha, pathar, cycle wo siarpief ke vaahan par barasaaye ja rahe the
 There was also an attempt to get him out of the vehicle
 itnaa sab kuch hote hue bhi javaanon ne sanyam banaae rakhaa or aatmaraksha ke liye firing kaa sahaara nahin liya
 Vishal Ji Pawar, 25, who was present that day on the driving seat of the CRPF vehicle, says that the situation was much worse than seen in the photos
 teen saal pehle hi siarpief jwine karne vaale pavaar ne kaha, ‘bheed itani thi ki vaahan kaa khisakna mushkil ho gaya tha
 They were violently shaking the vehicle from all four sides
 patharav itnaa tej tha ki mujhe dikhaai bhi nahin de rahaa tha
 The vehicle was being rocked
 aage kuch bhi nahin dikh rahaa tha, mujhe us vakt ahsaas bhi nahin hua ki gaadi ke neeche koi aa gaya he
 "pawar said," Not only stones but even bicycles were being thrown at the vehicle from the crowd
 vaahan ke bonete par bhi kai log chadhakar kud rahe the
 Not only this, they were also trying to open the door of the vehicle
 pavaar ke mutabik unhone or jeep par savaar unke saathiyon ne baad main us din kaa video dekha
 The situation was much worse than it looked in the video
 wo vaahan ko aag bhi laga sakate the
 Pawar said, 'that was the worst day of my life
 ’siarpief ke vaahan main us din senkend in cmand adhikari es es yadav driver ke saath vaali seat par hi baithe hue the
 Yadav, 54, has been in service for 30 years
 unki kashmir main teen posting rahi hai
 Yadav said, “that day we went to supervise two CRPF in Nohatta and one company in MR Ganj
 sab kuch saamaanya tha
 When we were returning from MR Ganj, Khwaja was crowded near the market
 vaahan ko duusari len se nohatta jane ke liye modaa to bheed hinsak ho uthi
 Stones were pelted on the vehicle from all sides
 ”yadav ke mutabik unhone duty par pehle bhi aisi sthitiyon kaa saamana kiya tha lekin us din jaisaa patharav pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 Yadav said, "for us it was a question of saving lives
 ek vakt to meraa haath bandook par bhi chalaa gaya lekin dil main yahi prarthana kar rahaa tha ki isaki naubat naa aae
 The crowd was so much that once the driver had to stop the vehicle
 usee vakt mujhe baahar khinchne kii koshish kii gai
 But the CRPF jawan sitting behind me immediately locked the door loudly
 baahar nikaal liye jane par hamaare saath kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 "yadav said," i knew that gun is not an option
 usase bheed main log hataahat hote
 i then told the soldiers in the jeep that no one would fire unless i said
 ” yadav ne ek minute ke liye tab siarpief commandent randeep singh se bhi baat kii
 According to Yadav, if the mob had taken out the soldiers, they would have been beaten to death
 thik vaise hi jaise jammu kashmir police ke dspi ayub pandit ko jama masjid ke paas peet-peet kar maar diya gaya tha
 Yadav and Pawar were accompanied by constables Ningappa Natekar, constable Ram Avatar and constable Ram Naresh on that CRPF vehicle that day
 teenon ne ek saath kaha ki wo hamaari jindagi kaa aakhri din bhi ho saktaa tha
 Constable Avatar said, "the angry mob was blocking the path of our vehicle
 ham andar baithe the lekin vaahan ko jor-jor se pite jane kii aawaaj sun rahe the
 They were moments of great stress for all of us
 ham sab bal bal bache
 Dr
 Sunim Khan, Medical Specialist of CRPF, is counseling all the five people on board
 da khan ne kaha, "jab maine us ghatana ke baad unhen dekha to sabhi stabdh the
 Yadav's blood pressure was low
 log ye nahin samajhate ki vardi ke andar bhi insaan hai
 They have been counseled
 ham unhen kuch din obsarv karenge
 According to Dr Khan, the driver Pawar was apprehensive about the FIR but was told that he would be fully supported by the organization
 srinagar menciarpienke aiji ravideep saahi ne kaha, “driver or officer ne us vakt jo kiya vahi sabase sahi kadam tha
 The important thing was that the soldiers did not fire
 aisa karke unhone keemtee jaanon ko bachaaya
 He certainly did a good job by doing so
 siarpief adhikariyon ne jammu or kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ke rukh kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 According to officials, the incident on June 1 is a tragedy but should not be politicized
 umr abdulla ne ghatana ke baad twit kar kaha tha ki sangharsh viraam kaa matlab bandook uthaanaa nahin he lekin to iskaa matlab kya he ki ab jeep kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 Regarding the registration of an FIR against the CRPF driver, Jammu and Kashmir Police DIG SP Vaid said, “I do not want to speak on the matter but death has happened so the FIR has been registered
 ” In the last and seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections, votes will be cast in eight parliamentary seats of Madhya Pradesh on 19 May
 ye sabhi siten madhya pradesh ke malwa or nimad ilaake kii hai, 2014 main bijepi in sabhi aath siton ko jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 In this strong bastion of the BJP, the Congress had changed the political mood of the state by making a tremendous dent in the assembly elections held last year
 aise main bijepi ke saamne apane durg ko barkaraar rakhane kii badi chunauti he
 Let us know that the eight parliamentary seats in Madhya Pradesh are going to polls
 iske tahat 64 vidhansabha siten aati hai, jinamein se 40 siton par congress kaa kabja he or mahaj 23 siten bijepi ke paas he
 While one seat was won by independents
 vidhansabha chunaav jaisaa hi voting pattern rahaa to bijepi ke liye apane puraane nattejey doharaana aasaan nahin he
 Indore: Indore Lok Sabha seat is considered to be a strong fort of BJP
 bijepi ne is seat par pehali baar 1989 main kabja jamaaya tha, iske baad se jeet kaa yah silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 Sumitra Mahajan, a BJP MP from Indore for eight consecutive terms, decided not to enter the electoral fray this time due to her age, the BJP has replaced her as Shankar Lalwani
 congress ne is seat par pankaj sanghavi ko utaara he
 In this way, there is a direct fight between Congress and BJP
 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad indore kaa raajnneetik sameekaran badal gaya he, yahaan kii aath main se congress or bijepi donon ke paas chaar-chaar siten hai
 Dewas: The Dewas Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh is reserved for Scheduled Castes
 is seat par congress ne padmashri or kabir vaani gane vaale bhajan gayak prahlada singh tipaania par daanv lagaaya he
 Whereas BJP has fielded former judge Mahendra Singh Solanki by cutting its sitting MP ticket against Tipania
 donon hi partiyon ke ummidavaar apni raajnneetik pari kaa aagaaj loksabhaa chunaav se kar rahe hai
 This seat came into existence in 2008
 astitv main aane ke baad pehali baar 2009 main hue chunaav main congress ke sajjan kumaar ne jeet darj kii thi
 He reached Parliament by defeating Thawarchand Gehlot
 iske baad 2014 main modi lahar par savaar bijepi ne yah seat congress se chin lee or yahaan se manohar oontwal saansad bane
 If the BJP has fielded the former judge by cutting the ticket of its sitting MP to retain this seat, the Congress has made the contest interesting by taking down the Bhajan singer
 devas seat ke tahat 8 vidhansabha siten aati hai, jinamein se chaar congress or chaar bijepi ke paas he
 Ujjain: There is a direct contest between Congress and BJP in Mahakal's city Ujjain
 haalanki yah ilaaka bijepi kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 In Ujjain parliamentary seat, BJP has fielded Anil Ferozia this time in place of his current MP Chintamani Malviya
 jabaki congress ne babulal malviya ko maidan main utarkar ladaai ko dilachasp bana diya he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Chintamani Malviya of BJP defeated Premchand Guddu of Congress by 3 lakh votes
 pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav ke baad ujjain sansadeey seat kaa sameekaran badal gaya he, yahaan kii aath vidhansabha siton main se paanch par congress kaa kabja he or teen par bijepi kaa
 If such voting pattern is there then it will be a big challenge for BJP to retain this seat
 mandsaur:madhya pradesh main kisaan andolan ke ranbhumi rahi mandsaur sansadeey seat par sabhi kii nigahen hai
 BJP has again fielded its sitting MP Sudhir Gupta from Mandsaur Lok Sabha seat, while Congress has once again reposed faith in Meenakshi Natarajan
 2014 main inhen donon netaaon ke bich siyaasi jang hui thi or sudhir gupta ne natarajan ko kareeb 3 lakh maton se maat di thi
 In terms of assembly elections, the Mandsaur parliamentary seat consists of 8 assembly seats, 6 of which are held by the Congress and two by the BJP
 aise main congress is seat par bijepi ko kadi chunauti detii hui najar aa rahi he
 Khargone: BJP has reposed faith in Gajendra Patel by cutting the ticket of its sitting MP Subhash Patel on the Khargona Lok Sabha seat
 jabaki congress ne govind mujalda ko maidan main utaara he
 In 2014, bjp's Subhash Patel won by nearly 2

 Khargona Lok Sabha seat consists of 8 assembly seats, out of which Congress won six seats
 jabaki mahaj ek seat bijepi or ek seat nirdaleey ne kabja jamaaya tha
 Such a changed equation is a big challenge for the BJP to retain this seat

 While the Congress has fielded its veteran leader and former Union Minister Arun Yadav

 The Congress has once again fielded its veteran leader and tribal face Kantilal Bhuria in Madhya Pradesh

 lekin ek saal ke baad hi unka nidhan ho gaya or baad main hue upachunaav main kantilal bhuriya bijepi se yah seat chhinane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 ratlam-jhabua parliamentary seat consists of 8 assembly seats
 pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main in aath main se 5 congress or 3 bijepi jiti thi
 In this way, there is a contest between the Congress and the BJP
 dhar:dhar loksabhaa seat anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit he
 On this seat, BJP has fielded Chhatar Singh by cutting the ticket of its current MP Savitri Thakur
 jabaki congress se dinesh girwaal chunavi maidan main utarkar mukaable ko dilachasp bana diya he
 In 2014, BJP had won this seat by one lakh, but the equations have changed after the assembly elections
 yahaan aath vidhansabha siton main se 6 congress or do bijepi ke paas hai
 In such a situation, it is not easy for the BJP to retain this seat

 Raj Babbar has resigned as the state president of the party

 In place of Raj Babbar, the command of the party can now be handed over to a Brahmin face

 Due to the changing political equation of the state, Raj Babbar is now unfit on the chair of UP Congress President

 There are five reasons behind Raj Babbar's departure from the presidency

 ab jab soobe main basapa-sapa ek saath aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, the Congress is not able to make its place in the opposition united against BJP due to Raj Babbar
 congress aise chehre ko laana chaahati he, jo sapa-basapa ko saadh sake
 The strategy to take advantage of the results of the by-elections has increased resentment in the Brahmin community due to the defeat of bjp's Upendra Shukla in Yogi's fort Gorakhpur by-election in Uttar Pradesh

 Despite this, he could not give any edge to the party's organization

 In such a situation, the party is not in a position to do any charisma in 2019

 On the one hand, Pakistan is clearing the way for the release of Hafiz Saeed, founder of the dreaded terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba and the leader of jamaat-ud-dawa, on the other hand his party Milli Muslim League (MML) to mislead the world
 Not recognizing as a political party
 jabpakistan chunaav ayogne MML ko raajnneetik dal ke rup main panjikrut karne ko lekar grih mantralay se raay maangi, to usne kaha ki MML ke taar aatankiyon se jude hue hai
 Therefore it cannot be recognized as a political party
 iske baad pakistan chunaav ayog ne MML ko raajnneetik party ke rup main panjikaran karne ke aavedan ko khaarij kar diya
 Experts say that due to pressure from India and America, Pakistan is pretending to stop Hafiz Saeed from entering politics, but the fact is that the Pakistan Army itself is lobbying to bring many terrorists including Hafiz Saeed into politics
 
 haal hi main pakistan kii sheersh adaalat ne navaj sharif ko pradhanmantri pad se barkhaast kar diya tha, jiske baad lahore kii NA-120 seat par upachunaav hua tha
 In this by-election, the Pakistan Election Commission banned the MML from contesting elections
 iske baad MML ke pratyaashee ko nirdaleey ke rup main chunaav maidan main utaara gaya tha
 During this, the picture of Hafiz Saeed was used indiscriminately in his banner and poster
 haalanki chunaav main MML samarthit pratyaashee ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin vah tisare paaydaan par jagah banane main kaamyaab rahaa
 The terrorists have been strong since this election
 aatankiyon ne pakistan main hone vaale aagaamee aam chunaav main bhi utarane kaa elaan kar diya he
 At the same time, the path of Hafiz Saeed's release also seems to be clear
 lahore hoicourt ne chetaya he ki pakistan sarkaar hafiz said ke khilaaf saboot de, varanaa usko reeha kar diya jayega
 Actually, Pakistan has kept the eyes of Hafiz Saeed under pressure from India and America
 haalanki pakistan ke rukh se saaf hota he ki vah hafiz said kii raajnneeti main aane kii khwaahish puri karnaa chaahati he
 Pakistani Foreign Minister had told Hafiz that during the US visit, Pakistan Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif had described Hafiz Saeed as a burden on his country
 neuyork main asia sosaeti seminar ke dauraan asif ne america ko bhi aade haathon liya tha or kaha ki kuch saal pehle washington aise logon ko 'darling' maanata tha
 Pakistani Foreign Minister said that it is very easy to say that Pakistan is supporting Haqqani, Hafiz Saeed and lashkar-e-taiba, but it is a burden for the country and we have said before that it is a burden for us, But give us some time to remove this burden
 40 saal ke mukesh rathod aajkal aaraam karke hi zyaadaatar samay katate hai
 He is waiting for when his diamond cutting unit will start again and he will get some work so that he can give some support to his family of 5 people
 vaise to surat main hira udyog 15 navambar se hi shuru ho jaataa he lekin is baar halaat alag hai
 Mukesh used to get 15 days salary as Rs 7500 on December 1, but this time due to demonetisation, the diamond industry has not been started yet

 ab sab kuch ligali tex ke daayre main aakar karnaa padegaa
 It will take 4 to 6 months to be implemented in the system
 tippaniyan However, many believe that in the end all will be well
 pehle karigar paisa lekar bhaag bhi jate the, wo bhi band hoga
 In normal days, where there is no place to walk, shops in the diamond industry market are completely closed today
 kai vyapaariyon ne apane karmchaariyon ke liye bank khate khulwaanaa shuru kar diya he lekin karmchaaree bhi apane kaam ke liye cash lenaa hi pasand karte hai
 In such a situation, the situation arising out of demonetisation seems extremely challenging for the diamond industry

 Many traders have started opening bank accounts for their employees, but employees also prefer to take cash for their work

 grih mantralay ne haal hi main NIA ko is maamle main masood ajahar or teen or aatankiyon ke kilaaf aarope patr daayar karne kii ijazat di he
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar also said in the Lok Sabha on March 16 that there were six terrorists in the Pathankot attack
 udhar is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi NIA kahati rahi he ki use sirf chaar aatankiyon ke shav mili hai
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has recently allowed the NIA to file charge sheets against Masood Azhar and three more terrorists in the case
 akele chunaav ladgaye ke apane purv ke prastaav ko darkinar karte hue shivasena ne aagaamee loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye bhaajapa ke saath haath milaane kaa faisla liya
 a few days later, a rift between the two parties began to emerge again
 shivasena netaa tathaa pashupaalan or matsay paalan rajyamantri arjuna khotkar ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ve jaalnaa loksabhaa seat se vahaan se saansad or maharashtra bhaajapa adhyaksh rawasaheb daanve ke khilaaf chunaav ladenge
 Khotkar has been an MLA from Jalna thrice, while in the last Lok Sabha elections Danve won this seat for the fourth time
 khotkar ne aise samay main yah ghoshnaa kii jab shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha he ki unki party sabhi matbhedon ko darkinar karte hue bhaajapa ke saath milakar kaam karegi
 Khotkar's rivalry with Danve is well known; for the last two years, he has been preparing for the Lok Sabha elections to defeat the BJP leader in his stronghold
 spasht rup se, yahaan ladaai vyaktigat pratishtha kii he
 But the battle between Danve and Khotkar is not the only case
 thane main, 22 bhaajapa parshadon ne mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ko patr likhakar shivasena ke saansad rajan vichaare kii ummidavaari kaa virodh kiya he
 However, a source says that the rebellion has been fueled by Shiv Sena leader and PWD minister Eknath Shinde
 scindia vichaare kii jagah apane bete shrikant, jo vartmaan main kalyaan se saansad hai, ko thane seat se chunaav ladaana chaahate hai
 In Aurangabad, local BJP workers have conveyed their reluctance and troubles to the party to work for Shiv Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire
 chandrapur main shivasena ke vidhayak suresh dhanorakar ne ghoshnaa kii he ki agar kendriya mantri hansraj ahir ko tikat diya gaya to ve bhaajapa ke khilaaf kaam karenge
 At the same time, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya in Mumbai north-east seat is facing opposition from Shiv Sena workers
 1989 se donon dal ek saath chunaav lard rahe hai or shivasena ne rajya main kai varshon tak gathbandhan main bade bhai kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 But after BJP came to power in 2014 assembly elections, Shiv Sena started criticizing it
 ek shivasena netaa kaa kahana he ki unki party ke kaaryakarta bhaajapa ko gathbandhan par haaavee hone dene ke mood main nahin hai
 The senior leadership of both the parties are making all efforts to bridge the differences between their cadre and local leaders
 udhaaharan ke liye, uddhav ne caderon ko chetavanee di he ki jahaan kahin bhi gathbandhan main aapasi jhagade najar aaenge, party un siton par chunaav hi nahin ladegi
 In an initiative to end the quarrel, Danve, on his part, has asked Khotkar's close friend and state cooperative minister Subhash Deshmukh in the BJP to celebrate Khotkar
 baad main, khotkar ne bhi kaha tha ki ve apni party adhyaksh ke faisle kaa sammaan karenge
 There are also mps like Rahul Shewale (shiv Sena) and Poonam Mahajan (BJP), who are sure that they will get full support of the workers of both parties
 is rassakashi par aabkaari mantri chandrashekhar baavankule kehete hai, 'mujhe in vivaadon kii koi vajah nahin dikhti
 The Shiv Sena used to dominate the Shiv sena-bjp alliance earlier
 ab shivasena ke netaa nahin chaahate ki bhaajapa gathbandhan main haaavee ho
