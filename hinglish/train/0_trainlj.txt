 With this, the discord of Mumbai Congress has emerged
 urmila or kripashankar singh ke congress chhodane ko party ke liye mumbai main bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 Urmila expressed her anguish with her resignation and said, 'instead of working on a major goal of my political and social sensibilities, some people in Mumbai Congress are using them for mutual fight

 karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 State power has become a nose fight, especially for BJP and Congress
 rajya main jati, samudaay kii raajnneeti kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Considering the huge population of backward, Dalits and Muslims in the state, Congress Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has introduced the AHINDA policy of social engineering
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki bijepi iskaa kya tod nikaalati he
 What is AHINDA state elections are held on 12 May
 iske liye mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne apni soshal ejineering kii niti AHINDA pesh kii he
 AHINDA is short form in Kannada which means Dalits, Minorities and Backward Castes
 gauratlab he ki siddharmaiya ne rajya main kareeb 150 karod rupee ke kharch se saal 2015 main ek jati janaganana bhi karai thi
 But his report was not made public
 haalanki, yah li ho gai he
 Accordingly, the share of Savarna Lingayat community in the state has come down from 16-17 per cent to just 9
 8 fisadi rah gaya he
 Similarly, the share of Vokkalinga community has come down from 14-15 per cent to around 8 per cent
 janaganana ke mutabik rajya kii 6
 Dalits constitute the highest 24 per cent of the 5 crore population
 rajya main musalamaanon kaa hissaa 12
 5 percent
 anusujit janajatiyon or kurubaas (jis samudaay se mukhyamantri siddharmaiya aate hai) kii jansankhya 7-7 fisadi he
 The population of Brahmins is just 2 percent
 is tarah AHINDA main karnataka kii kul jansankhya kaa kareeb 80 fisadi hissaa aata he
 This leaked data has forced all political parties in the state to change their strategy
 bijepi lingayat or vokkalinga ko manaane kii puri koshish kar rahi he
 JD s has tied up with Mayawati's BSP in Karnataka to woo the Dalit votes
 centre for studies of develping studies (CSDS) ne saal 2008 ke chunaav main karnataka main pade voton kaa saamaajik- jativaar vishleshan kiya he
 According to this study, in the last election, votes of high social background in Karnataka were almost equally divided among the three major parties
 congress ko is varg ke 34 fisadi, bijepi ko 33 fisadi or jedy (es) ko 31 fisadi vot mili the
 BJP has the highest number of votes of the upper castes, however, there is a huge difference in votes according to caste
 study ke anusaar sarvan lingayat ke 51 fisadi vot bies yediurppa ke netritv vaali bijepi ko mili the
 Yeddyurappa himself comes from the Lingayat community
 congress ko lingayat samudaay ke sirf 25 fisadi or janata dal es ko 15 fisadi vot mili the
 In terms of caste, the highest vote share of the upper castes was 41% for BJP, 33% for Congress and 13% for JD (S)
 echdi devgauda ke netritv vaali party jedy (es) ko vokkalinga samudaay ke 40 fisadi vot mili the
 The Congress got 35 per cent of this community, while the BJP got only 18 per cent of the votes
 AHINDA kaa sabase zyada vot congress ko mila thanichle saamaajik prishthbhumi ke voton kii baat karen to isamen congress kaa bahut acha janaadhar he
 In the last election, the Congress got 54 per cent of the votes of this class, while the BJP and JD (S) got 18–18 per cent votes
 obisi varg main se 38 fisadi vot congress ko, 29 fisadi vot bijepi ko or 20 fisadi vot jedy (es) ko mili the
 Dalits, tribals and Muslims voted for the Congress
 is teenon virgon se congress ko kramash: 50 fisadi, 44 fisadi or 65 fisadi vot mili the
 In comparison, BJP received 20 percent of Dalits, 25 percent of tribals and only 11 percent of Muslims
 is maamle main gaur karne kii baat he ki pichley kai chunaavon se karnataka main voton kaa yah pattern barkaraar rahaa he
 Considering the importance of caste and community votes in the state, all parties have also been making their strategy accordingly
 saal 1952 se ab tak rajya ke zyaadaatar mukhyamantreelingayatya vokkalinga samudaay se rahe hai
 Hence it has become the belief that these two communities are the most powerful in the state
 lekin siddharmaiya is dharna ko badalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court will hear the status of minority institution to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)
 isse pehle supreme court kii teen jajon kii peeth is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 Earlier, on the affidavit of the central government, the AMU had asked the Supreme Court for four weeks' time to reply
 bataa den ki centre sarkaar ne supreme court main upie sarkaar kii apil ko waapas lene kaa halafanama daakhil kiya tha
 The central government said in the Supreme Court that AMU cannot be given the status of minority institution
 sarkaar ne apane halafname main 1967 main ajij baasha cese main samvidhan peeth ke jajment ko aadhaar banaaya he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki AMU ko centre sarkaar ne banaaya tha naa ki muslim ne
 In the affidavit, the central government has cited the statements of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during a debate in Parliament in 1972, in which she said that if this institution was given minority status, then in denying other minority class or religious institutions in the country There will be trouble
 in sab ke bich centre sarkaar ne upie sarkaar vakt echaradi mantralay ke un patron ko bhi waapas le liya he jisamen factoti of medicin main muslimon ko 50 fisadi aarakshan diya gaya tha
 The Center gave minority status to AMU by passing amendment bill in Parliament against the Supreme Court Judgment of 1967 in 1981, which has also been misunderstood by the Modi government
 halafname main kaha gaya he ki is tarah court ke jajment ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye sanshodhan karnaa sanvaidhanik dhaanche ke khilaaf he
 Significantly, on the affidavit of the central government in the matter of giving minority status to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), the AMU had also filed its reply through an affidavit, saying that Modi government's affidavit is inspired by politics and the UPA government to the Center The affidavit should not be allowed to be withdrawn
 supreme court ne centre ko teen hafte main iskaa jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he
 The AMU had said that with the change of government, the attitude of another government should not be changed
 eemyu desh kii sabase puraani muslim uniwarsity he
 The minority status it gets has special significance for all Muslims
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main upie sarkaar kii apil ko waapas lene kaa halafanama daakhil kiya tha
 The Modi government has said in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that AMU cannot be given the status of a minority institution
 modi sarkaar ne halafname main 1967 main ajij baasha cese main samvidhan peeth ke jajment ko aadhaar banaaya he jisane kaha tha ki eemyu ko centre sarkaar ne banaaya tha na ki muslim ne
 The Center has also withdrawn the letters of the Ministry of Human Resource Development during the UPA Government in which 50% reservation was given to Muslims in the Faculty of Medicine
 centre ne 1967 ke supreme court ke jajment ke khilaaf 1981 main sansad main sanshodhan bill paas karte hue eemyu ko alpsankhyak kaa darja diya, use bhi modi sarkaar ne galat tehraaya he
 The affidavit states that making amendments to nullify the Judgment of the Court is thus against the constitutional framework

 Politically, Obama's visit to India was writing a new chapter of success
 lekin is daure ne bharat kedo padosiyon ko pareshaan kar diya
 Even if both neighboring countries say anything to show, their intention is clearly visible
 baichaiyn chinajab bharat main obama kaa bhavy swaagat kiya ja rahaa tha, tab china tilamila rahaa tha
 When Obama was praising India and Modi, the government of our neighboring country China was getting restless
 china ke tevar itane talkh ho gaye ki usne bharat ko america se dur rahane kii hidaayat tak de daali
 How can the infiltrators in the Indian border tolerate that the most powerful man in the world stays in India for three days and works towards further strengthening his relations with India
 fouran china ne pakistan ke saath apni dosti kaa bakhaan kiya
 Issuing a statement, told Pakistan to be his evergreen friend

 unka gussa bhi na chhip sakaa or pareshaani bhi nahin
 On the very first day of Obama's visit to India, Pakistan's nefarious intentions came to light
 seemaa par golibari kii gai
 On the second day, a news channel there, calling the PM Modi a 'butcher of Gujarat' and 'donkey', while keeping the civilization at bay
 paak sarkaar kii is jalan or pareshaani kaa ek sabab or bhi he ki pakistan ne bharat daure par aane se pehle obama ko apane yahaan aane kii daavat di thi lekin obama ne paak ke daavatnaamen ko thukraa diya tha
 In such a situation, Pakistan started to express its relationship with China

 Several partnerships between Obama and Modi were signed at Hyderabad House

 Apart from this, a comprehensive strategy against terrorism, India's permanent membership in the Security Council, development of new smart cities in the wake of climate change, digital and business sectors, establishment of 'hotline' among national security advisors, sharing of aircraft technology, foreign investment Under the liberalization of FDI regulations in defense and insurance sectors, with the help of the US, Visakhapatnam, Allahabad and a Big agreements have been signed like making Jammer a smart city, which will benefit India

 dilli sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich jang kaa silsilaa abhi thama nahin he
 Now this case has once again reached the Supreme Court
 dilli sarkaar transfar-posting ke maamle main sabase badi adaalat ke paas pahunchi he, is maamle par agle hafte sunwaayee ho sakati he
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal alleged that Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is still not accepting the court order and not allowing the transfer posting to the government

 But on the issue of transfer posting, there was a clear message from the Lieutenant Governor that this right cannot be given to the government
 is par kejariwal kaa kahana he ki aisa pehali baar hua he ki centre sarkaar sabase badi adaalat kaa aadesh hi nahin maan rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party says that the Supreme Court has said that the Delhi government has the right to take decisions on all issues except police, land and public order, yet why this is happening

 iske alaava supreme court ne saaf kar diya he ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja milanaa mumkin nahin he
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the elected government of Delhi is responsible for running the state
 faisle ke baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi twit kar khushi jataa di he, unhone kaha he ki dilli main loktantr kii jeet hui he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has been continuously alleging that the Modi government at the Center is pushing its agenda through LG and not allowing the state government to work

 ye chintaa isliye bhi zyada he ki duniya ke jane-maane bhavishyavaktaa nastredamas ne bahut pehle yah bhavishyavaanee kar rakhi he ki varsh 2018 main teesraa vishwayuddh hoga
 Nostradamus said that this third world war would be between two directions
 yani teesraa vishwayuddh purab or pashchim ke bich hoga
 Between the two directions, the world's greatest Nazumi, the prophet Nostredamus, has predicted that in the year 2018, there will be a third world war
 is bhavishyavaanee ke mutabik teesraa vishwa yuddh sirf do or do se zyada deshon main nahin balki do dishaao ke bich hoga
 That is, between east and west
 yevishwayudhitna bheeshan hoga ki iske khatm hone ke baad is prithvi par mahaz kuch log hi shanti kaa anand uthaane ke liye jinda bachenge
 However, the prophecy of Nostradamus is not necessarily true
 aisa pehle bhi ho chukaa he
 There are 15 thousand nuclear bombs in the world, all the countries of the world have accumulated the goods of destruction
 is vakt puri duniya main saadhe 15 hazaar se zyaada parmaanu bam hai
 Each of these bombs is enough to make a whole city become a cremation ground
 japani shahar hiroshima or nagasaki par america ne parmaanu bam giraakar jaisi tabaahi machaai thi
 If the same scene will be in the whole world, then no one will be left to see it
 donon paksh hai majbootamgar maujuuda halaat jaise ban rahe hai use dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki agar vishwayuddh hua to wo vaaki do dishaao ke bich ho saktaa he
 Because on the one hand the US and its allies are NATO countries, on the other side, China and Russia are seen as a shield for North Korea
 in donon pakshon ke hathiyaaron ko aamane saamne rakhaa jaae to ye barabari par najar aate hai
 Many countries are on both sides
 Through a possible figure, understand in which direction all countries armed with nuclear weapons are seen to be moving
where america ke saath jahaan france, england or israel khadey dikhaai de sakate hai
 So China and Russia can stand with North Korea
 to aaie dekhte hai kiske paas kitne hathiyaar hai
 The number of weapons of both the factions is the highest in America with 6800 nuclear weapons, while France has 300, England has 215 and Israel has about 80 nuclear weapons
 matlab america gut main kul parmaanu hathiyaaron kii taadaad 7395 hui
 On the other hand, North Korea is believed to have 6 nuclear weapons in the faction of North Korea
 haalanki kuch agenciyaan ye taadaad das ke aasapaas bataati hai
 On the other hand, if China and Russia are to be treated with North Korea, then China has 260 and Russia has 7000 nuclear weapons
 inaki kul taadaad ko joda jaae to uttar korea gut ke paas 7270 he
 That is, both groups have almost equal number of nuclear weapons
 bharat ke paas hai 140 parmaanu hathiyaarais fehrist main bharat or pakistan ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he kyonki jang ke halaat main inkaa ruukh kya hoga ye abhi saaf nahin
 But if both countries have the number of nuclear weapons, then India has 130 nuclear weapons, while Pakistan has 140 nuclear weapons
 prithvi kaa chakkar lagane vaali missilsochie agar 2 parmaanu bamon ne japan ke do shaharon kaa bura haal kiya tha to 15 hazaar se zyadaparmaanu bamis dharti kaa kya karengen
 If there was a world war, only a few people would really survive to see peace
 aisa isliye kyonki in deshon ke paas aisi aisi misile bhi hai jo parmaanu bamon ko lekar puri prithvi kaa chakkar laga sakati hai
 Several thousand km
 tak ja sakati hai misilecmerica ke paas 15 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai, to vahiin france ke paas 10 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai
 England has 12 thousand kilometers of missiles
 israel ke paas saadhe 11 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai
 At the same time, North Korea has 13 thousand kilometers of missiles in the North Korea group
 china ke paas 14 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai
 While Russia has missiles capable of hitting up to 15,000 kilometers
 prithvi ko barbaad kar degaa sirf ek batanyani america kii missile north korea ke har shahar tak or north korea kii missile america ke har shahar tak pahunch sakati hai
 The same situation exists for missiles of other countries
 or khaufazada karne vaali baat ye he ki in tamaam deshon kii mixilon ke batan rashtradhyaksh apni apni teble or brikekeson main rakhte hai
 That is, the start of the third world war and the destruction of the earth is just a matter of pressing a button

 Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday, addressing the election meeting, forgetting the rivalry of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and JDU senior leader Nitish Kumar, said that this will not wash away the sins of imposing the alleged jungle raj on Bihar and Nitish again in Bihar 
 fasebuk ke jariye lalu or nitish ke milane par kataaksh karte hue susheel ne aarope lagaaya ki argedy pramukh lalu prasad or purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne gale milane kaa jo naatak kiya, usase bihar par jangal raaj thopane ke paap nahin dhulenge
 He alleged that while Lalu Prasad kept Bihar hostage in hooliganism and poverty for 15 years by pretending to Mandalism, Nitish Kumar paved the way for Jungle Raj-2 as an excuse for secularism
 donon ne bihar kii bhalaai ke liye nahin, keval apni satta bachaane ke liye haath milaayaa he
 Sushil said that these leaders, who have heard each other for twenty years, have mocked the mandate of 2005 and 2010 with unethical mail
 unhone kaha ki janata ne nitish kumaar ko lalu prasad se gale milane ke liye vot nahin diya tha
 If this was to be done, instead of resigning from the post of Chief Minister, he should have dissolved the Assembly and got a new mandate
 susheel ne kaha ki lalu-nitish ek-duusare ko bhai bataate hai
 If both of them have accepted to walk together half-heartedly, then they should thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for creating such political compulsion
 aisa swaarthee milaap karne vaale log khud hi mit jate hai
 He said that people remember that Lalu Prasad had once made fun of the fast development of BJP-JDU government of Bihar
 aaj ve desh ko bullate train dene ke narendra modi sarkaar ke faisle kaa majaak uda rahe hai
 Sushil said that Lalu had once said that eating biscuits of Nitish Kumar during the solar eclipse was inauspicious
 ve bhaajapa ke lokapriy netaa narendra modi ko aaj ashubh bataa rahe hai
 Accusing the Nitish government, he said that to remain in power, Nitish may forget everything about Lalu Prasad, who pushed Bihar into superstition and poverty, but will not forgive anyone

 The group plans to repay about 60 per cent of the debt by selling its assets
 daawa he ki asset bikri se samooh kaa kul karj ghatakar 48,645 karod rupee rah jayega
 The group's telecom company Reliance Communications (rcom) alone owes about Rs 47,000 crore of debt to 38 defaulters and is going through a debt restructuring process
 company apana spectrum, fibre, telecom tower, aadi bechakar kareeb 25,000 karod rupee jutaney kii ummid kar rahi he

 milengi yaa nahin yaa wo kisi hogi yah abhi saaf nahin he
 Throughout the day news came that Yogendra would be given charge of Maharashtra and Prashant would be given the responsibility of legal cell, but a formal announcement was made that a new responsibility would be given
 arvind kejariwal is baithak main nahin the, magar unka sadasyon se sampark zarur rahaa hoga
 Arvind's resignation was rejected by the executive
 aath ghante tak chali is baithak se yah sanket to miltaa he ki aam aadmi party main faisla bahumat kii aupchaarikta se hi hota he, lekin yah saaf nahin he ki maamla sulajhaa he yaa in donon netaaon ko kinare kar diya gaya
 But the statements of both the leaders are telling that they will remain in the party even as ordinary workers
 buudhvaar subah jis tarah se maafeename se shuruyaat hui usase laga ki aam aadmi party main bhalmansahat kii to kattai kami nahin he
 Ashish Khaitan apologized for his tweet, Yogendra Yadav said that i will also improve
 kumaar vishwaas ne kaha ki ve donon pakshon se baat kar rahe hai or maamla sulajhaa lenge
 Along with such well-received statements, news was also flashing on the channels, which seemed like everything was set
 yogendra yadav ne bhi kaha ki shaam ko acchhee khabar milegi lekin kapasaheda ke farm house kii band deevaaron ko kya pataa tha ki sab tay hone ke baad bhi tay hone main itnaa vakt lag jayega
 a crowd of locals gathered outside the Kapashera farm house
 kuch aap samarthak bhi yogendra, prashanth bhushan, manish sitaudiya or arvind kejariwal kii achche dinon vaali tasviren lekar aae the
 You also got to print United's hashtag
 in sabaki maang thi ki aap na toote
 Some well-wishers of the Aam Aadmi Party also wrote letters to the executive and said that we are all concerned about the happenings in AAP
 khaskar aap ke bheetar aalochanaon ke prati badhati asahansheeltaa ko lekar
 Attempts are being made to shore up voices that demand internal democracy, accountability and transparency
 kisi bhi party main virodh or asahmatiyaan hoti hai lekin use ek zimmedaar tareeke se sanbhaalanaa chahie
 It is signed by people like filmmakers Anand Patwardhan, Himanshu Thakkar, Purushottam Agarwal
 kya maamla sulajh gaya
 It was already being said that Prashant and Yogendra were outside
 ye badi baat he ki is faisle par ab party ke bahumat kii muhar he
 Is it clear that the questions raised were discussed or decided
 ye sab bataane ke liye sirf kumaar vishwaas or pankaj ko adhikrut kiya gaya he
 But this is what politics is called
 kam se kam jo bhi hua wo aamane saamne hua
 Both groups must have been fighting for their talk in the executive for eight hours
 lekin sab kuch wo nahin hota jo baithak ke baad kaha jaataa he
 What happened in the meeting will be the real news
 kya yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke baahar hone se ek baar phir tay ho gaya ki party par arvind kejariwal kii hi pakad he
 Party members know and recognize their leader
 yah baat bhi kam mahatvapurn nahin he ki kaaryakarini main yogendra or prashanth ko 8 mat mili hai
 This means that eight people held a different opinion from Arvind Kejriwal or his supporters
 kya in sab baton se is vivaad ke alaava aantarik loktantr kii prakriya ko vishwasaneeyata milti he
 It is true that the leader who will be held and who will hold the bet, but the record of those who are out is not so bad
 to aam aadmi party main loktantr kaa paalan hua yaa loktantr ke naam par bolne waalon ko sazaa mili
 BJP and Congress leaders have attacked that Yogendra Yadav has been sentenced to speak
 sawaal he ki yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ne baahar hokar hasil kya kiya
 What Arvind Kejriwal gained from this controversy
 kya ve isse bari ho gaye ki party main sirf unheen kii chalati he yaa ye sabit ho gaya ki unke khilaaf bolkar aath log kaaryakarini ke sadsy to he hin
 Those of you who participate in politics or want to do it in future should take full care of how the party runs
 kisi raajnneetik dal kii sari uplabdhi isi par nirbhar nahin hona chahie ki wo sarkaar kaise chalaati he
 How the party runs or is run is a bigger question than the government

 In contrast, there is a terrible shortage of fodder in Gaushalas located in Harevali, Delhi, where the Delhi government is making all claims to promote cowsheds and welfare of animals
 gaushala prabandhan ko punjab kii cheema mandi se chaara khareednaa pad rahaa he wo bhi dabl daam par
 Typically, the fodder that was available for 2
5 to 3 rupees per kg was given to the gaushala management for Rs 6: 30 per kg
 dilli haryana border par sthit gopal gau sadan gaushala ke manager rashtrapal ne bataaya, "gaushala main jagah kam he, dedh saal se dilli sarkaar ne fund nahin diya or govansh zyada hone se gaushala ke chaara godaam khaali pade hai, agar sarkaar vakt rahete paisa de detii to sijan main hi chaara store kar liya jaataa
 "this cowshed, spread over 15 acres, has a capacity of keeping only 3200 bovines while 4500 cows are living here
 yahi vajah he ki ab gaushala ne MCD kii gaayen lene se manaa kar diya or ab dilli ke alji se or sarkaar se gaushala ke liye or jameen kii maang kii he
 Due to lack of space in cowsheds, fodder stores could not be stored during the season
 lihaaja chaara khatm hote hi unhen adhik daam main khareednaa padataa he
 The increasing number of cows has made it difficult for the management to run the expenses of the cowshed
 gaayon ke saamne chaare ke sankat se gaushala prabandhan pareshaan he ki unhen chaara khilaaen kyonki unke paas bajet he hi nahin
 You can understand how the 5 gaushalas under Delhi government are running on the donations of the rich

 Revla Khanpur Gaushala has a capacity to hold 3440 cows, but Gaushala has now stopped keeping cows here
 bataa den ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 17 janvari bavana kii shri krishna gaushala kaa daura kiya or daawa kiya ki yahaan pani kaa intazaam kiya jayega
 Targeting the MCD, he had also talked about releasing 12 crore outstanding funds
 gaushala kii dekharekh karne vaale log mukhyamantri kejariwal ke is daure se khush to hue lekin unki maang he ki sarkaar gaayon kii dekharekh ke liye die ja rahe kharch ko badaye
 Gaushala manager Rajendra Singh Shekhawat has said that the amount of money to be maintained per cow should be increased from Rs 20 to Rs 80

 Former India Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav described bjp's politics as communal in India Today Chemind rocksevent held in Delhi on Saturday
 unhone bijepi netaaon ke is bayaan par jawaab diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki pichhali sapa sarkaar main muaavje sirf muslimon ko hi milte the
 Akhilesh Yadav said, 'I said that the election of UP was fought with communalism
 bijepi ke netaaon ne kaha tha ki hinduon kii maut par kuch nahin hota he, muslimon kii maut par 50 lakh kii madad kii jaati he
 'SP has been accused of being a casteist party
 bijepi aksar is mudde par sapa ko gherti rahi he
 In response to this charge, Akhilesh said, this will not happen in 2019
 ab hamane unka formula unheen par laga diya he
 Now they will not win, so they are losing
 agar ham gathjod karen to kaha jaataa he ki jativaadee log hai, bijepi kare to usesoshal ejineeringkaha jaataa he
 What is Hindi in this social engineering
 bijepi ke log mudde par chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai, ham unhen muddon se nahin bhatakane dena chaahate hai
 The SP lost in the last UP assembly elections
 us chunaav main congress or sapa kaa gathbandhan tha
 Both Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav had seriously taken steps for the alliance
 haalanki donon partiyon ko karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Will the two parties come together again in future elections? In response, Akhilesh said that we had a good friendship with Rahul ji
 main us chunaav (assembly chunaav) kii baat kar rahaa hum
 The BJP people were nervous then
 main us tarah kaa noujvaan hum ki ek baar dosti kar letaa hum to phir kabhi nahin chodta hum
 The Congress party has suffered two consecutive embarrassing defeats of its political history
 party adhyaksh rahul gandhi istipha dene par ade hai, to vahiin kaaryakarta soch rahe hai ki aakhir is sthiti se kaise baahar niklaa jaae
 The House of the Lok Sabha has also started here
 is bich congress kaaryakarta ne ek poster nikaala he, jisamen upie cheirperson or purv congress adhyaksha sonia gandhi kii tulana jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai se kii gai he
 This poster has been printed by Prayagraj Congress activist Hasib Ahmed
 poster main sonia gandhi ko jhaansi kii rani darshaya gaya he
 Apart from him, the poster has pictures of rahul-priyanka-rajiv-indira Gandhi, Pramod Tiwari and some other leaders
 tasviir par jo likhaa he vah bhi khaas he
 It has been written, 'in the glow of year 91, that sword is old, it is a very strong man, she is Indira, the queen of Rajiv'
 aapako bataa den ki haseeb ahamed, prayagraj ke kaaryakarta hai or poster boy ke taur par hi jane jate hai
 Often posters made by him are the subject of discussion on media and social media
 phir chaahe priyanka gandhi wadra ko congress main laane kii maang ho, rahul gandhi ko bhavi pradhanmantri bataanaa ho yaa phir aisi kai maangen jinhen kaaryakarta puri karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Recently, Hasib also wrote an open letter to Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi jab adhyaksh pad se istipha dene par ad gaye the, tab unhone ek khat jari kar likhaa tha ki rahul kii aguwai main party aage badi he or jamkar ladi he
 Therefore, if he resigns, many workers will commit suicide
 aapako bataa den ki congress ko lagaataar 2 baar loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In the 2014 elections, the Congress, which was reduced to 44 seats this time, does not even have enough numbers to get the post of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 pichhali loksabhaa main bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha
 In politics, the difference between haemorrhage and floor is so small that when and where it reaches, it is not understood
 abhi 4 maheene pehle vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bijepi kii taraf se vasundhara raaje or congress kii taraf se sachin payalat donon hi partiyon kaa cheharaa the
 But everything has changed in this month itself
 congress kii taraf se mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kii lokapriyata par vot maanga ja rahaa he to bijepi piem narendra modi kii aandhi par apni ummid tikaae baithi he
 Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Congress state president Sachin Pilot, who claimed to hold power during the Rajasthan assembly elections, are nowhere to be seen in the Lok Sabha elections
 chaar maheene main hi inaki kismat is kadar palati khaaegi inhone bhi kabhi nahin sochaa hoga
 CM Ashok Gehlot is handling the election command from the Congress
 naam ke liye pradesh adhyaksh ke taur par payalat najar aa rahe hai, yahaan tak ki party ke kaaryakartaaon kii baithak bhi ashok gahalot hi le rahe hai
 Ashok Gehlot is also making the final decision of who will be the candidate in the Lok Sabha elections
 kisne sochaa hoga ki 4 maheene main hi rajasthan ke up mukhyamantri sachin payalat kii haisiyat ek aam mantri kii ho jaaegi
 Congress leaders are saying that Gehlot is more popular than Narendra Modi in Rajasthan
 ashok gahalot ke chehre par hi log congress ko vot denge
 Congress general secretary in-charge Avinash Pandey and Health Minister Raghu Sharma believe that Ashok Gohlot is very popular with Modi in Rajasthan today
 vasundhara ji kii baat to bijepi adhyaksh se pucho
 
 
 What can i tell, no one knows where Vasundhara Raje is after the defeat
 kaha to yah ja rahaa he ki dilli main pichley 4 dinon se baithi hai
 But BJP national president Amit Shah is not giving even time to meet
 kahaan to 4 maheene pehle bijepi kii sabase taqatvar netaa hua karti thim
 The state could not even become a president without his consent
 vah pradhanmantri or rashtriya adhyaksh tak ko ankhen dikhaa de rahi thim, lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi kii ho rahi sabhi bainkon se vasundhara raaje gaayab hai
 Here, BJP national president Amit Shah is taking all the decisions directly
 is maamle par poochne par jaipur granmin se saansad or kendriya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod ne kaha ki vasundhara ji kii baat to bijepi adhyaksh se pucho
 
 
 What can i tell modi banaam ashok gahalot kii yah ladaai pehali nahin he
 Even during the assembly elections, both these faces were bet by the Congress and the BJP
 pehle daur main narendra modi ne baaji maari thi
 Now once again both Congress and BJP are going to fight in these two faces in the Lok Sabha elections

 bharat main modi sarkaar ko hindu sarkaar kaha jaataa he
 Right-wing government
 bijepi kii sarkaar
 The formation of this government here has gone through Pakistan
 use laga ki kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna kaa dar ki aazaadee ke baad hindustan main musalmaan surakshit nahin rahegaa, ab sach ho jayega
 The foreign media also understood that a Hindu government was formed in India
 lekin aaj aazaadee ke lagbhag 70 saal baad bhi burma (myanmar) main 13 lakh musalmaan beghar hai
 These Muslims are Rohingyam Muslims
 sufi sect ke sunni musalmaan hai or aazaadee ke kai dashakon pehle se bengal se palaayan kar myanmar main rah rahe the
 In the old accounts, they were considered citizens of Burma
 burma ke jis kshetra main rohingiya musalmaan rahete hai, vahaan 98 fisadi yahi musalmaan hai
 But when added to the entire Burma population, these Muslims are a minority
 buddha dharm ke anuyaayi burma main inaki naagarikta kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 In 2015, the Myanmar government has rejected citizenship of these Muslims
 ab vah chahta he ki ye musalmaan avibhajit bengal ke us ilaake main waapas chale jaaen jo ab bangladesh ke adheen he
 They are Muslims, but Bangladesh does not want to take them because, except Hinduism from Bangladesh, it has been many decades to migrate to Muslim and become illegal refugee in India
 ab sawaal yah he ki yadi burma ke rohingiya musalmaan bangladesh ke hai or inkaa vivaad aazaadee ke pehle se he, to kya aaj pakistan in musalamaanon ko apane mulk main kubul karegaa? bharat kaa is maamle se koi lenaa-dena nahin he kyonki aazaadee or bantwaare ke vakt rohingiya musalmaan bangladesh yaa east pakistan ke us ilaake main rahete the jo muslim bahul tha
 They were naturally part of Pakistan according to the partition rule
 lekin east pakistan main garaabi, laachaari or barbarta ke chalate ye burma ke gaiyr-rihaayshi ilaakon main bas gaye
 Today this Rohingia Muslims are homeless
 unka maamla antarrashtriya str par behad pechida mudda bana hua he
 They are exiled from Burma
 bina naagarikta ke duusare darje ke naagarik yaa rifuji kah len
 At the same time, the countries of America and Europe may shy away from taking these Muslims as refugees because they themselves are facing serious challenges from Muslim refugees
 iske baavjood yah musalmaan pakistan yaa bangladesh kii taraf nahin dekh sakate
 Because the condition of these two countries is going through a great challenge due to Islamic Jihad and terrorism
 ab in rohingiya musalamaanon kii tarah bhale pakistan ek sunni bahul desh he
 These Rohingia Muslims cannot look for any help from them because the condition of such refugees in Pakistan is very bad
 shiya, sufi, hindu or buddha dharm ke longon ke liye pakistan main vaise hi koi jagah nahin he
 In Myanmar, only their citizenship and land has been taken away, on reaching Pakistan, the question will be raised on their religion and according to the Law of the Land they will also be declared non-muslims

 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki bijepi pradesh kii 50 siton par apni jeet kaa paracham laharaayegi
 He also said that not only strong candidates will be fielded against Rahul Gandhi from Amethi parliamentary constituency, but local people will also have favorite candidates

 Asked who will be the party candidate from Amethi, Chaurasia said that BJP is an ideological organization and that the decisions are also collective, so it is not fair to say who will be the candidate right now but it is certain that there will be a strong candidate of local choice from here

 In response to the allegations against Madhya Pradesh Finance Minister Raghav and the question about his arrest, he said that this is a private matter, but it will not have any impact on the Lok Sabha elections

 18 karod rupye kii kamai kii, pichley teen din main kik ne box offis par jhande gaadte hue 83 karod se zyada kii kamai kar lee he
 Sallu's fans are very fond of the film
 Film Review: superstar salmaan khan kaa best package he kikullekhneey he sallu bhai ke liye id hameshaa lucky rahati he
 It is believed that on the day of Eid, Salman's fans will reach Salman in maximum number of Idi and this film can break all the records through his earnings
 gauratlab he kik kii kahani or ection sab kuch yashraj binar kii dhooma siries se mail khaataa he
 devil-turned-salman Khan has defeated Dhoom's bike stunt with his bicycle stunt
 salmaan ke stant ne dhooma ke aamir, jon ar rithik ko peeche chhod diya he
 Now it will be a crime for children below 14 years to do physical work like hard labor
 desh ke bal shram kanoon main sanshodhan ne bal mazdooree kii paribhaasha badal di he
 Now in any case, children below 14 years of age cannot be employed
 bal shram kanoon main hue sanshodhano par ab sirf raashtrapati ke dastakhat hone rah gaye hai
 After the President's approval, we have to send information to the International Labor Organization that we have implemented these provisions in our country
 taaki bacchon ke shaareerik or maansik swasthya ke liye samuchit dekhbhaal ho
 Because of this, children will get the benefit of Right to Education
 bachche ko kaam par nahin bhejne kaa dar hoga to use skool bheja jayega
 New changes will come from the new provision, it will be to see how the new provision will tighten on child labor and will pave the way for children's education
 ab tak 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon ko kuch surakshit maane jane vaale halke phulke kaam karaane vaale udyongon main mazdooree karana vaid tha
 Initially, there was an exemption that if there is a family industry or business, then any child under the age of 14 years was admitted as a helper there
 lekin ab kisi bhi tarah ke shram se bacchon ko dur rakhaa jayega
 If the business is family, then only blood relations like parents, uncle, maternal uncle and aunt have family business or domestic industry, then the child can only help there after school period or earlier, not wages
 nahin liya ja sakegaa bacchon se kisi bhi tarah kaa kamsarkaar ab khatarnaak, kam khatarnaak or surakshit udyogon kii suchi bana rahi he
 In this list being made for the first time, the definition and scope of such dangerous industries or businesses will be clarified so that no one can take advantage of any confusions or blurring
 aise khatarnaak udyogon main aatishbaajee, tejaab yaa rasayan se sambandhit anya kai tarah ke udyog dhandhe aaenge
 In the first 18 professional and 65 processing businesses, children were allowed to work
 lekin ab chunki 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon se kisi bhi tarah kaa kaam nahin liya ja saktaa he lihaaja ye suchi bekaar ho gai he
 Now, the double punishment will be met, if punishment is given to those who violate these provisions, then even double or even more strict provisions have been made in it
 yani pehle ye niyam the kibal shram kanoonke tahat doshi paae jane par das hajaar rupee tak jurmaana yaa teen maheene se lekar saal bhar tak kaid yaa phir donon kaa praavdhaan tha
 But now for the first time, there is a provision of fine of 20 thousand to fifty thousand rupees or imprisonment for six months to three years or both
 bacchon ke liye ab fund kaa praavdhandusri baar pakade jane par sidhe saal bhar se teen saal tak kii kaid kaa praavdhaan he
 Now cognizable offenses will be filed against those caught in violation of child labor law
 yani jamaanat ke liye magistrate ke saamne peshi jaruri he
 Now there is also a provision of a separate fund for the rehabilitation of children rescued from child labor
 pehle aisa koi kosh nahin tha
 Because of this there was no means of rehabilitation or education of the child
 jisase bachche ke waapas dhandhe main laut aane kii ashanka yaa majaburi bani rahati thi
 But now this will not happen, it has been expressed
 bacchon ko khilone behad pasand hote hai, unhen dekhte hi unke chehre ke bhav unki khooshi ko saaf taur par darshane lag jate hai
 With these toys, children learn a lot, for example, the identification of Colors, Counting, Table and more
 lekin akasar mata-pita bina soche samajhe bacchon ke liye khilone kharidne lagate hai, jinka asar unke maansik vikaas par padataa he
 If you want your child to be active and have continuous development of learning ability, then select toys for children carefully
 adhiktar ajukational toy aise hote hai jo bacchon ko ek edlt ke saath bina kisi saport or condishan ke ghulana-milanaa sikhaate hai
 There should be no toy option to get parents attention
 bacchon ko aise surakshit, saste khilone upalbadh karaaen, jinka vikasaatmak upyog ho
 Children's toys should be those that promote learning and development in areas that encourage development and creativity
 un khilaunon se bachanaa chahie, jo kalpanaashakti kaa upyog karne se bacchon ko hatotsahit karte hai
 Give children toys that develop their social, emotional and cognitive skills in coping with life's problems
 yah jaruri he ki aap aise khilaunon kaa sillection karen, jo bacchon ko sochane or samajhane kii ore prerit karen
 Note that such toys are not very expensive or trendy
 apane bacchon ke saath aisi kitaaben or magazine share karen, jinhen aap bhi unke saath pard saken
 Some toys promote violence or racial or gender discrimination
 aise khilaunon se apane bacchon ko dur rakhen
 Use of video and computer games should be limited
 pratidin bacchon kaa kul screen time, jisamen tivi or computer dekhnaa bhi shaamil he pratidin 1 se 2 ghante se zyada nahin hona chahie
 Allow children under 5 years of age to use TV and video games only when they are developmentally appropriate for them
 bacchon ko die gaye khilone aise hone chahie jo nukile na ho or bacchon ko nuksaan na pahunchaa saken
 If your child is small, do not give them toys that have small parts
 aapkaa baccha in khilaunon ko munh main le saktaa he, jisase uski jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 Most educational toys are those that teach children to mingle with an adult without any support and condition
 mata-pita kaa atension paane ke liye khilone opshan nahin hone chahie
 Provide safe, inexpensive toys to children that have developmental use
 bacchon ke khilone aise hone chahien, jo unhen vikaas or rachanaatmakataa ko protsaahit karne vaale kshetron main seekhney or vikaas ko badhaava dene vaale hon
 Avoid toys that discourage children from using imagination
 bacchon ko aise khilone den, jo jivan kii samasyaon se ubaarane main unke saamaajik, bhaavnaatmak or sangyanatmak kaushal ko viksit karen
 It is important that you select such toys, which motivate children to think and understand
 dhyaan rahe is tarah ke khilone bahut adhik mahange yaa trendi nahin hote
 Share such books and magazines with your children, which you too can read with them
 kuch khilone hinsa yaa jaateey yaa ling bhed ko badhaava dene vaale hote hai
 Keep your children away from such toys
 video or computer game kaa istemaal simit hona chahie
 The total screen time of children per day, including watching TV and computer, should not exceed 1 to 2 hours per day
 5 saal se chote bacchon ko tivi or video games kaa istemaal tabhi karne den jab vah unke liye vikasaatmak rup se upyukt hon
 Toys given to children should be such that they are not sharp and do not harm the children
 agar aapkaa baccha chota he to unhen aise khilone na den jinke chote-chote parts hon
 Your child may take these toys in the mouth, which may threaten his life
 kohinoor heere ko britain se waapas laane kii yachika par supreme court ne sunwaayee band kar di he
 The court said that we are satisfied with the reply of the Center that the government is making efforts so the court need not hear further in this matter
 - ham britain main hone vaali nilaamee ko kaise roak sakate hai yaa kisi duusare desh ko aise aadesh kaise de sakate hai
 We are surprised what kind of petitions are filed
 court ne yah kehete hue yachika kaa nipataara kiya
 On September 2016, the Center said in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that the Kohinoor diamond belonged to India and was fraudulently seized by the East India Company from Maharaja Dilip Singh when he was a minor
 105 carat ke kohinoor ko kabhi bhi britain kii maharani ko bataur tohfa nahin diya gaya
 This has connected the sentiments of the people of the country
 bharat kohinoor ko britain se waapas laane ke liye sambhaavnaaen talash rahaa he, kyonki kanoonee rup se ye sambhav nahin he
 Although both India and Britain are bound by the UNESCO treaty, India cannot go to the International Court of Justice in Kohinoor as Kohinoor was already taken from India before the treaty
 tippaniyan The petition states that Kohinoor was not gifted by Maharaja Dilip Singh to the East India Company but was forced to give it
 kohinoor se sambandhit puraane kagajaat bhi yahi bataate hai ki centre ko is mudde par antarrashtriya forum janaa chahie or kohinoor ko waapas laana chahie
 a petition to bring the Kohinoor diamond back from Britain was heard in the Supreme Court
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne kaha tha ki kohinoor kaa maamla gambhir he, centre sarkaar ko is mudde par kisi thos suzav ke saath court main aana chahie
 India is exploring possibilities to bring Kohinoor back from Britain as it is not legally possible
 haalanki bharat or britain donon UNESCO sandhi se bandhe hue hai lekin kohinoor ke maamle main bharat antarrashtriya court nahin ja saktaa kyonki kohinoor ko sandhi se pehle hi bharat se le jaaya ja chukaa tha

 The comments yachika me kaha gaya he ki kohinoor ko maharaja dilip singh ne east india company ko gift nahin kiya tha balki unhen ise dene ke liye vivash kiya gaya tha
 Old papers related to Kohinoor also suggest that the Center should go to the international forum on this issue and bring back Kohinoor

 Polling for the third phase of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections is going on
 jaise-jaise matdaan ho rahaa he, pratyaashiyon ke dilon kii dhadkan bhi badhati ja rahi he
 Where can the wave of voters turn their stance, nothing can be said
 lekin in chunaavon main ek baat jo saaf nazar aa rahi he, vah he shivpal yadav ko khud kii seat kaa khatra
 Shivpal Singh is contesting from Jaswant Nagar assembly seat for the fifth time
 pradesh main chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai main kahin chachaa shivpal kii kursi na chali jaae
 This can be gauged from the fact that Shivpal Singh has not left his Assembly for the last one month
 khasbaat yah ki na to shivapal vidhansabha chhodkar baahar gaye hai or na hi ab tak koi bayaan diya he
 They are keeping quiet
 haa, bas itnaa hi kehete nazar aate hai, '11 march ke baad boluungaa
 ' party sutara bataate hai ki akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav ke virodh main khadey ho jane ke kaaran shivpal ko apni kursi jane kaa dar sata rahaa he
 He is not afraid of any opposition party but of his own family
 kyonki akhilesh yadav reliyon ke dauraan saaf-saaf kah chuke hai ki apane log hi party or parivaar ko nuksaan pahunchane main lage hue hai
 At a rally held in Etawah on Thursday, he said, 'people of Etawah who have created a gap between Netaji and me, to teach them a lesson
 ’ akhilesh jaswant nagar main prachaar karne nahin aae
 Shivpal has no hope of getting along with his nephew, so he campaigned alone in the assembly

 In the battle of uncle-nephew in the state, the chair of uncle Shivpal should not be lost
 is baat kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pichley ek maheene se shivpal singh apni vidhansabha chhodkar kahin baahar nahin gaye hai
 Significantly, neither Shivpal has left the assembly nor has made any statement so far
 ve ekadam chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Yes, i can only say, 'I will speak after March 11
 ' Party sources say that Shivpal is afraid of going to his chair as Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav stand up against him
 unhen dar kisi vipakshi party se nahin balki apane khude ke parivaar se lag rahaa he
 Because Akhilesh Yadav has clearly stated during his rallies that his own people are engaged in harming the party and family
 guuruuvaar ko itawa main yojit ek raily main unhone kaha, ‘jinhone netaji or mere bich khai paidaa kii he, itawa ke log unhen sabak sikhaane kaa kaam karnaa

 '' yah kahkar naveen patnayak kaa kafila aage bad jaataa
 Patnaik will be sworn in as the Chief Minister of Odisha for the fifth time
 is maamle main unhone sikkim ke mukhyamantri rahe pawan kumaar chamling kii barabari kar lee he
 Chamling has held the post of Chief Minister for 24 years, but this time he lost the election
 vahiin, is chunaav main modi magic bhale hi puure desh main chalaa, par odisha jaakar yah nishprabhavi ho gaya
 The BJP may have won 8 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, but in the assembly elections Patnaik stopped the Modi wave
 kul 147 siton vaali vidhansabha main 146 siton par chunaav hue jisamen 112 siten patnayak kii party biju janata dal (bijd) ne hasil kii hai
 Patnaik has neutralized Modi's wave in 2014 too
 tab bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko loksabhaa chunaav main ek or vidhansabha chunaav main 10 siten mili thim
 The Odishaites have confidence in Patnaik's leadership, which he also highly respects
 shaayad yah baat odisha ke logon kii bhi samaj main aa gai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi called and congratulated him just after his golden victory in the assembly elections
 patnayak kaa kahana he ki endie ko desh main mili safalataa ke liye unhone bhi modi ko badhai di
 Patnaik is in favor of having a better relationship with the Center
 unka kahana tha ki odisha ke hit main unki soch sakaaratmak he
 In such a situation, his relationship with the center is expected to be good
 rashtriya raajnneeti main bijd kii bhoomika ke sawaal ko unhone wet and vaach kahkar taal diya
 Patnaik has been the Chief Minister of Odisha since 2000
 desh ke sabase garib rajya kaa patnayak ne jis tarah se kayapalat kiya, vaisaa koi karishmai netaa hi kar saktaa he
 Modi broke into Mamata Banerjee's votes in West Bengal but she did not do any in Odisha
 haalanki, iske liye modi ne pradhanmantri banane ke baad odisha main kareeb 14 sabhaayen to bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne 13 sabhaayen kii hai
 As soon as some exit poll surveys showed BJP coming from 23 to 45 seats in the Odisha Legislative Assembly, BJP state president Basant Kumar Panda and Union Minister Jual Oram gave a statement that this time the BJP government will be in Odisha
 yahi nahin, mukhyamantri ke chehre ke rup main kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan or bhubaneshwar se loksabhaa chunaav jeetin aparajita mahanti kaa naam charchaa main aa gaya
 But when the results came, BJP could get only 23 seats
 rajya main bhaajapa kaa sarkaar gathan kaa sapana mungerilaal ke haseen sapanom kii tarah hi sabit hua
 However, after winning the 2014 elections, the confident Naveen Patnaik suffered a setback when the BJP seats in the Zilla Parishad elections in February 2017 increased from 36 to 297
 vahiin bijd 651 se ghatakar 473 par or congress 128 se ghatakar 60 par aa gai thi
 Seeing the same growth, the bjp's national executive meeting was held in Bhubaneswar on 15 April 2017, in which all BJP stalwarts including Narendra modi-amit Shah were present
 is kamyaabi ke baad patnayak bhaajapa kii ore bahati bayaar ko rokane ke liye bahut sakriy ho gaye the
 By shuffling the organization and government, they showed the door to tainted and disputed leaders
 unke daahine haath rahe baijayant panda, damodar raut sareekhe diggajon ko bhi party se baahar kar diya gaya
 Business conclaves started to be organized with public welfare schemes and projects for development of Odisha and for investment for industrialization
 darasal, congress kii darakati jameen kaa laabh bhi bhaajapa uthaanaa chaahati thi par patnayak kii sooyeeboojh bhari raajnneeti ne aisa nahin hone diya
 He also fiercely fought the conspirators and outside opponents within the party
 isse odisha main patnayak kaa graph badhata gaya
 This election was actually between two strong-image leaders
 ek taraf modi to duusari taraf patnayak
 Patnaik did the work which could not be done in a big way in this election
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi bhaajapa ne 8 siten hasil kar lee hon, lekin vidhansabha chunaav main patnayak ne modi or unki party kii daal nahin galane di
 He restricted the BJP to 23 seats in the assembly
 is tarah odisha aise rajya ke rup main ubhara jahaan modi magic nahin chalaa
 Naveen once again emerged as invincible
 haal hi main odisha main fani chakravaat ke dauraan raahat-bachaav ke kaary ko lekar bhi patnayak kii chautarafa tarif hui
 Modi also praised Patnaik government for its disaster management after visiting Odisha
 fani chakravaat se tabaahi kaa manjar abhi bhi kaayam he
 Patnaik's state government and Modi's central government will have to reconcile with the challenge of rebuilding Odisha
 varisht patrkaar praphul das kaa kahana he ki media main publicity se dur rahane vaale patnayak 'baat kam or kaam zyada' ke siddhant par chalate hai, so unka bhaashan sankshipt hota he
 His knowledge of Odia has also been questioned, but he was not deterred
 kahin se nahin laga ki unhen odissa nahin aati
 His popularity can be gauged from the fact that for the first time he also contested and won from West Odisha assembly seat Bijapur
 unke kshetra main har das main se nau log yahi kehete the ki ve vidhansabha main patnayak or loksabhaa ke liye modi ko vot denge
 In such a situation, it seems that the people of Odisha wanted to vote for Modi, but Patnaik is the Jananayak there, in such a situation he was sure to get the crown of Odisha
 patnayak ne chunavi adhisuchana se pehle sabhi 30 jilon kaa daura kiya or phir chunavi adhisuchana ke baad bhi ise doharaaya
 Along with the demand for women reservation, they also got the benefit of implementing 33 percent reservation in ticket distribution in Lok Sabha elections

 com / wxzpbagwwt It is clear that the Indian management will change the XI for the third Test, but it is very difficult to say for sure what those changes will be
 perth main khele gaye duusare test main bharat kaa team management pich ko padhane main puri tarah naakaam sabit hua tha
 The Indian team landed in Perth without a spinner
 or iskaa bada khamiyaja bharat ko bhugatna padaa tha
 After this, the team and captain had to face all round criticism
 team ke saath museebataan bhi jari thim
 Prithvi Shaw, Rohit Sharma and Ashwin were out with injuries
 ab chayankartaaon ne baaki maichon ke liye mayank agarwal or hardik pandya ko team main shaamil kiya he
 Despite this, it is difficult to predict the exact XI
 ab jabaki team main philhal teen visheshgy salaami ballebaaj hai, to sanjay ne suzav diya he ki bharat ko melbern main hanuma vihari se pari kii shuruyaat karaani chahie
 This is because Sanjay wants that it will be very difficult for Mayank Aggarwal to immediately shield himself from the Australian situation, while Vihari has played a Test
 is par manjrekar ne kaha ki kukabura gend ke saamne ekadam se hi bina match practice ke nae salaami ballebaaj ko utaarna gat hoga
 At the same time, India also has a long history that no top batsman has played his first Test in Australia
 unhone kaha ki agar yah test bharat main hota, to mayank ko sidhe match main utaare jane se koi samasya nahin thi
 But it can be risky to land them in Australia without match practice
 vaise sanjay kii ilevan main rohit sharma kaa chayan thodaa hairaani bharaa he
 Rohit's ODI attitude in Perth was shocking! Also, their way of getting out
 baharhaal, jaan lijie ki melbern test ke liye sanjay manjrekar kii final ilevan kya he

 Although various economists are giving reasons for demonetisation and GST for the decline in India's GDP growth rate, BJP President Amit Shah has attributed the technical reasons behind it

 He said that Indian companies and trade organizations should focus on getting patents on their products, so that their assets are retained within the country
 amit shah ne kaha ki modi sarkaar alpakaalik laabh ke bajaay dirghakaalik lakshyon par dhyaan de rahi he

 The district administration of the SP leader's native town of Rampur is now considering listing Azam Khan (azam Khan) as a land mafia on the state government's 'anti-land mafia' portal

 Rampur Superintendent of Police Ajay Pal Sharma said that keeping in mind the many cases of land grabbing, the name of Azam Khan has been listed on the anti-earth Mafia portal

 pakistani videsh mantralay ne apane ek bayaan main kaha he ki bhartiya paksh har baar kii tarah uchit jaanch kiye bagaiyr gaiyr jimmedaarana bayaan dete hue niraadhaar aarope lagaataa he
 On the contrary, Pakistan accused India of making such an allegation only to divert attention from the brutal efforts being made to overcome the ongoing 'armed rebellion' in Kashmir
 saath hi pakistan ne elosi paar kisi bhi tarah kii javaabi karrwai ko lekar bharat ko chetavanee bhi de daali
 Pakistan has further said in its statement that we hope that the international community will pressurize India to stop the persecution and human rights violations in Kashmir, and such incidents across the loc are permanently curbed

 is raily main arvind kejariwal, akhilesh yadav, faruk abdulla, emke stallin or echdi kumaraswami samet kai vipakshi netaaon ne hissaa liya tha

 Mamta Banerjee also said that we respect those whose slogan is 'inquilab Zindabad'

 Not only Mamta Banerjee, but many leaders of the opposition - Farooq Abdullah, HD Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowda and Tejashwi Yadav also concluded their speeches with 'jai Hind'
 gujarat ke yuva patidaar netaa hardik patel ne apane bhaashan ke ant main ‘bharat mata kii jai’ kaha
 Surprisingly, before Shah's claim, a picture like the Hindi newspaper clipping was being shared on social media, it was claimed that the opposition leaders never shout patriotic slogans
 cliping kii tasviir vaale daawey ko jhootha hi ajtak news channel kii ek pramukh ankar shweta singh ke naam ke saath jod diya gaya

 ab yah kahana bhi thodaa kam hi hoga ki pichley 30 varsh se ram mandir andolan kii aguai kar rahi vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) or vrihad sangh parivaar ayodhya mandir maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle se atyadhik prasann hai
 But amidst the gloom, there have already been reports of wrangling over who will be a part of the trust the court has ordered to build the temple
 darasal, faisla abhi puri tarah se logon ke jehan main utraa bhi nahin tha ki trust ke masale par sugabugahat shuru ho gai thi
 Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, head of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, said that no further trust is needed as this trust was formed only for the construction of the Ram temple
 haalanki, ramalala par swaamitv kaa daawa karne vaale nirmohi akhaada (jiske shaibayat ke adhikaar ke daawey ko supreme court ne faisle main khaarij kar diya he) ke mahant dinendra das ne nyaas kaa virodh kiya he or kaha he ki use nae trust kaa hissaa bananaa chahie
 Therefore, there is confusion now because the Supreme Court order also states that the Nirmohi Akhara will be represented in the new trust, so he is currently the only confirmed member of the trust
 vihip ne mandir nirmaan ko lekar anaupchaarik baatcheet main kuch baaten pehle hi spasht kar di hai jin par vah samjhauta nahin karegi
 First, the money to build the temple will come from the people, not from the government
 yah bhi ki 1990 ke dashak ke ram janmabhumi andolan ke dauraan ekatra kii gai eenton kaa istemaal mandir kii neenv main kiya jayega or mukhya mandir kaa nakshaa bhi vahi rahegaa jo gujarati vaastuvid chandrakant sompura (jinke dada ne somnath mandir kaa dizin taiyaar kiya tha) ne pariklpit kiya he
 Forty percent of the work has been done in the form of stones and it will be used in the temple
 phir mandir ke singh dwaar kaa nirmaan usee sthaan par hoga jahaan 1989 main mandir ke liye shilanyas hua tha, jisaki pehali eent sangh parivaar kii vrihad hindu samavesh yojana ke tahat ek dalit karsevak kameshwar chaoupal ke haathon se rakhwai gai thi
 Says Surendra Jain, national joint general secretary of the VHP, "the trust should represent those who have been involved in the campaign for the construction of the temple, who had a vision of how the temple would be built and operated and together the society Must be respected people
 ham ummid karte hai ki sarkaar trust ko har vaanchit swatantraaa pradaan karegi
 "now speculations are being made about how big the trust will be and who (other than Nirmohi Akhara) will be involved in it
" centre sarkaar main ek sutara kaa kahana tha, ''sarkaar ne philhal is bare main vichaar nahin kiya he ki trust kaa gathan kaise kiya jayega
 She will soon take a decision in this regard and consent of all the parties will be taken in it
 ''andolan se sambhddha zyaadaatar log sarkaar se yah apeksha bhi kar rahe hai ki vah un pramukh santon ke bhi kam se kam ek-ek pratinidhi ko trust main rakhegi jinhone mandir ke liye sangharsh kiya tha or ab ve is duniya main nahin hai
 These include Paramhans Ramchandra Das, head of the Digambara Akhara and Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas of Ayodhya, Mahant Avaidyanath of Gorakshpeeth, Gorakhpur of Gorakhpur (present Mahant of the Peeth and Guru of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath), Jagadguru Ramchandra Acharya and Swami Vamdev
 mahant nrity gopal das or yugapurush paramanandji maharaj ke bhi trust main rahane kii sambhaavna he
 VHP joint general secretary Swami Vigyanand said, "the trust should be autonomous, transparent and truly representative of all
" ''haalanki is kathan ko lekar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh zyada aashwast nahin he
 a senior RSS official, on the condition of anonymity, said, "it is not necessary that all the people fighting for the temple should be in trust
" trust ko niojakon va kriyanvayan karne waalon kii jarurat he or in santon main se kai log is kaam ke liye upyukt nahin bhi ho sakate hai
 However, the final decision in this regard has to be taken by the government, which has been given the responsibility of forming the trust
 hamane abhi tak sarkaar se is bare main baat nahin kii he
 The Supreme Court said in its judgment that the construction of the temple should be done through a trust under the supervision of the government
 kuch vidhi visheshgyon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki chunki ayodhya adhigrahan adhinium 1993 ke praavdhaan 6 va 7 ke tahat tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pi
 V
 narsingh raav sarkaar ne ayodhya main vivaadit sthal or uske aasapaas 67
 Had acquired 7 acres of land, so it also gives the current government the right to hand over the construction work of the temple to an existing trust instead of creating a new trust
 darasal, supreme court ne inhen praavdhaanon par nirbhar rahakar sarkaar ko yah nirdesh diya he ki vah is kanoon ke khand 6 ke tahat kisi trust yaa upyukt sanstha kaa gathan karke ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye teen maheene main ek yojana taiyaar kare
 VHP executive chairman Alok Kumar said, "I believe that this work can be entrusted to an existing trust
 lekin meri yah vyakhya puri tarah se ek vakil ke taur par he, kisi vihip netaa ke taur par nahin
 If i am right, this trust can also be the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, which has so far worked to carve stones for the temple
 ''mahatvapurn baat yah he ki vihip yah bhi chaahati he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah trust ke sadsy bane kyonki uski najar main vah hindutv kii alag-alag takaton ko ekajute karne vaale shaks hai
 a VHP leader said, "amit Bhai is the pivot who will take all sides with him
" '' sutron kaa kahana he ki sarkaar khud bhi is baat par vichaar kar rahi he
 a major task before the Trust will also be how 67 acquired in 1993
 7 acre jameen ko istemaal kiya jaae
 People like Sompura, the original craftsman of the temple, hope that no new dimensions will be added to the main temple
 ve maanate hai ki dizin main maamuli-sa bhi badlaav ab tak kiye gaye pathar ke kaam ko bekaar kar degaa
 "the government should show prudence not to do so," says Sompura
 '' ve itane varshon main is pariyojna par kaam kii dhimi rakrataar se kaaphi mohabhang-sa mahasoos kar rahe the
 Soon after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, 350 artisans were put to work, but for the past few years, only seven artisans were working there
 nyaas ne 1990 ke dashak ke shuruaati varshon main pariyojna ke liye kareeb aath karod rupye ekatra kar liye the, jisamen se zyaadaatar chote-chote yahaan tak ki 1 va 2 rupye ke ansh main the
 But in subsequent years, the inflow of money kept diminishing
 abhi tak kii jo dizin he, uske anusaar mukhya dhaancha 270 foot lanbaa, 145 foot chaudaa or 141 foot ooncha hoga
 It will be one of the few rare temples that will have an octagonal sanctum sanctorum
 sompura ke model main vibhinn gatividhiyon jaise ki aspataal, sant niketan, katha kunj, bhojanalay or darshanik va anusandhan centre ke liye bhi gunjaaish rakhi gai he
 According to Sompura, this is the area in which the trust can use new technology to change and promote it
 mandir ke shilpkaar kaa maananaa he ki bhavishya kii tasviir ab bhi dhundhlee he kyonki ''kaam nyaas ko saunpane ke bajaae abhi nae trust ke gathan kaa kaam ho rahaa he
 The Uttar Pradesh government had already started the rest of the work in the city in hopes of a favorable decision
 sarayu nadi ke tat par 250 karod rupye kii laagat se ram kii 251 foot oonchi pratimaa, 500 karod rupye ke kharch se nai ayodhya nagari kaa vikaas or ek hawaii adde ko pehle hi manjuuri di ja chuki he
 The government also hopes that now the number of passengers in Ayodhya will also increase rapidly
 kaashi-mathura masalaajaha tak kaashi va mathura ke mandiron ke andolanon kaa masalaa he, unako lekar sangh ke netaaon ne philhal chuppi saadh rakhi he
 But there is no doubt that they will use this victory in the Ayodhya case to gain further strength
 alok kumaar kaa kahana tha, ''is samay hamaara sara dhyaan ayodhya par kendrit he or baaki maamle uthaakar ham mukhya mudde se dhyaan bantaana nahin chahenge
 There are also reasons for doing so
 sangh parivaar kii vrihad ranneeti ke tahat pradhanmantri narendra modi or sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kathith rup se is baat par sahmati jataai he ki parivaar main kisi bhi vyakti ke jariye kaashi or mathura ke maamle philhal nahin uthaae jaaenge
 a strict instruction in this regard has been sent to all the affiliated organizations of the union
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki supreme court ne yah rukh saaf kar diya he ki puja ke sthaan (vishesh praavdhaan) adhinium 1991 ke anusaran main kisi bhi anya puja sthaan ke bare main bhavishya main ab koi bhi mudda nahin uthaaya jayega
 This law prohibits any change in the status of the time of independence of any place of worship
 lekin vihip ke bheetar se dikkatein khadi karne vaali awaajen pehle hi sunai de rahi hai
 Some leaders have gone on to say that even if a mosque is built on five acres of land acquired by order of the Supreme Court, it is not in the name of any Muslim aggressor but any inclusive member of the community like Paramveer Chakra winner Havaldar Abdul Hameed or former President A

 Meanwhile, if the situation remains favorable then the temple should be ready in three-four years, i
e
 before the general elections of 2024 and the Modi government will be ready to make it a big electoral issue
 sompura ke anusaar, pattharon kaa kaam 40 fisad ho chukaa he or neenv rakhe jane ke baad uskaa turant istemaal ho saktaa he
 The point is clear, even if some difficulties were encountered at this time, the Ram temple in Ayodhya will be ready as a reality by 2024

 He broke the teeth of a classmate, for which he has been suspended from school as a punishment for a month
 aise main agar bachche ko skool main maaraa nahin gaya to phir mansukh singh ke peeth par jo chot ke nishaan dikh rahe hai
 Where and how did those marks come from
