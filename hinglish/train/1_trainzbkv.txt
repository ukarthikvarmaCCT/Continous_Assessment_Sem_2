 Should i commit suicide or love? About four months ago on 24 November 2015, Pooja Tiwari asked this question on her Facebook
 ye sawaal yun hi tha, yaa iske peeche tab bhi koi matlab tha ye to pataa nahin
 But after four months, this question suddenly became very important after the death of Pooja and especially the manner in which she died
 par is sawaal kaa matlab aap samajhen uske liye puraa kahani samajhnaa pehle jaruri he
 Dostapuja Tiwari, who was present in the flat at the time of death, was a journalist in a web portal in Faridabad and lived in a rented flat on the fifth floor of the same apartment in Faridabad
 pichley ravivaar yani ek may kii der raat isi apartment kii paanchavin manzil se gir jane kii vajah se uski maut ho gai
 When Pooja fell from the fifth floor, her two friends were also present in her flat
 ek police inspector amit or duusari amarine
 Soon after Pooja's death, both her friends told the police that Pooja herself had jumped from above as she was upset about a case of blackmailing against her lodged in the police
 kahani kaa pehla pahaloodrasal jis web portal main puja kaam karti thi usee portal ke liye usne ek story kii thi
 This story was against the scouring doctors and especially those doctors who were involved in the feticide
 is silsile main puja ne apane dost ke saath milakar sting bhi kiya tha
 But later one of those doctors wrote a police report against Pooja saying that she is asking for two lakh rupees from her and is blackmailing her
 ab chunki police main maamla darj tha, lihaaja police ne bhi shuruyaat main maan liya ki bahut mumkin he ki isi tanaav main puja ne khudakushi kar lee ho
 The twist that came in the story was one aspect of the story, but there was only one problem in this story, and that the case of blackmailing against Pooja was registered a long time ago
 agar usne sirf usee vajah se apni jaan di to koi suicide note nahin kyon nahin likhaa? police isi pahalu se abhi maamle ko khangaal hi rahi thi ki tabhi kuch aisi chijen saamne ain jisane puja kii maut kii kahani main kai nae mode laa die
 Recording of calls received in the phone, a simple case of death has suddenly become very complicated
 kyonki puja ke phone main ek recording baraamad hui
 There are many such things in this recorded conversation in which the secret of Pooja's death is hidden
 or ye sari baatcheet puja kii maut se bas kuch der pehle kii he
 This conversation can not only reveal the truth about Pooja's death but also answer her question that she wrote on Facebook four months ago
 darasal jis raat puja kii maut hui us shaam ko bhi inspector amit puja ke saath tha or maut se ain pehle bhi saath tha
 In the evening, Amit and Pooja were sitting in a park near the flat
 amit tab park main hi baitha sharaab pi rahaa tha
 After this, Inspector was in Pooja's house till one and a half hours
 yahaan tak ki puja paanchavin manzil se neeche tab giri jab amit ke haath se uskaa haath chuta
 Pooja spoke to her friend Bharata over the phone
 is vakt puja ke saath amit bhi maujuud tha
 Call recording evening 05
 12 se 05
 Up to 40
 kya he recording main?is recording main amit vashishtha naam kaa ye police inspector, jise puja ke gharavaale apana family friend or puja kaa local gargian bataa rahe hai, puja se kaise or kis mudde par baat kar rahaa he
 Drunk in alcohol, this local guardian is asking all things to Pooja in a police-like style, which usually someone with a very important place in one's personal life can ask
 wo puch rahaa he ki banki naam ke ek ladke ke saath puja akele room main kyon gai or kitni der rahi or kya-kya kiya
 Here Pooja and Amit are together, while a third friend named Bharata is on the phone
 ye baat apane-aap main puja kii jindagi main amit ke role kii ek jhalak dikhaati he
 Incidentally, the day Pooja fell from the fifth floor under mysterious circumstances, Amit Vashistha was still in the Pooja room in the middle of the night and both of them together with their third friend Amreen had drunk heavily that night but before that Amit Had created a lot of uproar
 amit ke khilaaf aaropee doctorlekin itnaa hone ke baavjood faridabad police philhal sirf amarine ke usee bayaan kii binah par puja kii maut ko sidhi-sidhi khudakushi maan kar chal rahi he, jisamen amarine ne blakemeling kaa cese darj hone kii vajah se puja ke khudakushi karne kii baat kahi he
 However, the doctor who lodged a report of blackmailing against Pooja and after Pooja's suicide, who has been charged by the Faridabad police to force suicide, has now come out against Inspector Amit Vashisht
 dow anil goyal ne kaha, 'amit kii bhoomika sandigdh he
 What was he doing in Pooja's room at half past one night? ho saktaa he, usee ne dhakka diya ho
 'amit told this story, there came the questions, Amit told the story of Pooja's suicide, it is also very strange in itself
 amit kii maane to us raat puja pehle balakani se latak gai thi or tab usne puja kaa haath bhi pakad liya tha, lekin haath chhot gaya or puja paanchavin manzil se neeche gir gai
 Now the question arises that if all this was going on at midnight, then why did he not make noise to save the life of Pooja
 kyon uski teesri friend amarine duusare kamare se balakani tak nahin chali ai
 Apparently, a lot happened that night before Pooja's death and Amit continued to create a ruckus about Pooja's relationship for a long time
 aise main ye saaf he ki maamla jitani sidhi-sapaat khudakushi kaa bataaya ja rahaa he, vaisaa he nahin
 Amit and Pooja who had married now after Pooja's death, a neighbor of Pooja has come forward and she has made many shocking revelations about Pooja and Amit's relationship
 is mahila kaa daawa he ki puja or inspector shaadi kar chuke the
 The name of this woman who describes herself as Pooja's mouth sister is Usha
 usha kaa kahana he ki puja, amit se na sirf beintehaa pyaar karti thi, balki donon ne shaadi bhi kar lee thi lekin amit hameshaa uske saath jyaadati karata tha
 He was also often beaten up badly
 bachche ko janm dene ke liye videsh janaa chaahati thi poojadrasal, puja faridabad main jis jagah pehle kiraye ke makaan main rahati thi, usee ke paas usha kii dukaan he
 Pooja often used to come to Usha's shop
 yaheen se donon kii dosti hui
 After this, Pooja started calling Usha in law
 usha ke mutabik puja use apni sari baaten bataati thi
 Usha Pooja said that some time ago Amit was already married but she kept this thing hidden from him
 magar baad main puja ko sach pataa chal gaya jiske baad donon main jhagada bhi hua
 According to Usha, Pooja was also pregnant, but Amit got her aborted
 aise main puja aage pregnant hone par videsh ja kar apane bachche ko janm dena chaahati thi
 Not given the truth, the truth has been told that the things that are being said about the suicide of Pooja are false
 puja itani majboot ladki thi ki wo khudakushi kar hi nahin sakati
 Usha said that Pooja had sent her personal photos on her mobile
 inamen unki puja or amit kii shaadi kii tasviren bhi thim
 But Pooja's brother deleted all the pictures from his mobile
 usha kaa kahana he ki wo puja ke maa-baap ko uski sachai bataanaa chaahati thi lekin puja ke bhai or amit ke logon ne use aisa nahin karne diya
 It was very strong that till a few hours before Pujamaut, Pooja who was going to Mumbai office to talk about her case in the blackmailing case filed against her, how did she commit suicide by jumping from the fifth floor shortly after? This is a big question
 ye sawaal isliye bhi bada he, kyonki puja ko jaanane vaale bataate hai ki wo kamjor ladki nahin thi balki behad khushmijaaj or majboot ladki thi
 Pooja Tiwari came to Delhi from Indore a few years ago to dream of becoming a big and famous journalist of the country
 kuch akhabaaron main kaam kiya phir bas kuch vakt pehle hi ek bade group ke news portal main naukari mil gai
 While working here, he also performed a sting operation on the satchel doctors but this sting operation proved to be a big headache for him
 doctoron ne uske khilaaf blakemeling kii report likhva di or puja suspend ho gai
 But if the people who knew Pooja were to be believed, then she was not so weak that she would commit suicide on such a thing
 kyonki apni khudakushi se ain pehle bhi apane ek dost ke saath baat karte hue puja ne is maamle main apana paksh rakhane ke liye portal ke mumbai offis jane kaa apana plan share kiya tha
 In such a situation, she will commit suicide after some time, it is difficult to even think
 lekin iske kuch hi der baad uski rahasyamayi halaat main maut ho gai
 Pooja was very active on Facebook and often uploaded her pictures, but surprisingly, Pooja, who was so close to Inspector Amit, never put any pictures of her on Facebook
 vaise puja kii munh boli bhabhi kii maane to amit hameshaa apane or puja ke rishte ko chhupaae rakhana chahta tha
 And when this secret opened in later days, he took Pooja to Sadbhavana apartment
 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur jile main thagi kaa ek hairaan karne vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Where only one Sub Inspector of UP Police became a victim of cheating
 ek shaatir thag ne khud ko adishnal espi bataakar sab inspector se hajaaron rupee thag liye
 However, by the time he understood the whole case, the accused escaped
 ghatana kaa shikaar hone vaale sab inspector jhangaha thana main padasth hai
 According to the information, a call was received on the mobile phone of the said Sub Inspector on Sunday night at 8:30
 kol karne vaale ne duusari ore se khud ko adishnal espi bataaya
 Seeing the style and voice of the caller, the inspector could not understand anything
 wo phone karne vaale ko adishnal espi samajhakar baat karne laga
 The caller asked the sub-inspector to come to him with 20 thousand rupees
 sab inspector bina deree kiye 20 hajaar rupee lekar us shaks ke bataae pate par pahunch gaye
 The man was sitting in a car in Railne Colony waiting for the inspector
 vahaan car main pichhali seat par baithe shaatir shaks ne bade aatmavishvaas ke saath sab inspector ke kaam kii tarif kii or unase 20 hajaar kii rakam lekar driver ko piparich kii taraf chalane ke liye kaha
 All this happened in such a hurry that at first the inspector did not understand anything, but after some time he realized his mistake
 iske baad sab inspector ne fouran piparich thane ke prabharee nireekshak ko phone karke aapbeetee sunai
 The inspector in-charge, after listening to the officer, blocked a blockade to apprehend the accused, but the police got the car in which the accused was riding
 car main shaatir thag nahin tha
 When the police caught the driver and questioned him, he told that his car was rented by someone
 baad main vah shaks kasbe main utarkar kahin chalaa gaya
 This incident is being discussed in the entire department
 jisase daroga ji kii kirakiri ho gai
 At present, the police is not ready to say anything on this matter

 The committee had suggested to include other subjects in the training of teachers
 maanav sansaadhan mantri ne shikshakon kii training ko ucch shiksha se jodne kii baat bhi kahi
 These decisions related to teachers are being linked to the speech given on the Prime Minister's Teachers' Day
 haalanki shikshakon kii training main riform ke suzav 2012 main justise verma kamishan ne bhi die the
 Training of teachers under Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was also done in this meeting

 Bhojpuri Cinema: After Diwali, Chhath Puja starts in the entire country including Bihar
 chaaron taraf chhath puja (chhath Puja Geet) ke geet bajane shuru ho jate hai
 This time too Bhojpuri famous artists like Pawan Singh, Khesari Lal Yadav, Nirahua (nirahua) are making six songs
 bihar or upi ke kai ilaakon main chhath puja ke song logon kii jubaan par chadhate ja rahe hai
 On the occasion of Chhath Puja, these Bhojpuri Songs have rocked
 dekhen chhath puja ke 5 dhamaakedaar video
 
 
 During the Mahaparva Chhath Puja (chhath Puja) of Chhathi Maiya, devotees have a big buzz of Bhojpuri songs
 nahaye-khaay (nahay Khay) yaa kharnaa prasad (kharna or lohanda) ho yaa phir surya dev ko arghya dene kii baat ho sabhi bhakt bhojpuri bhakthi gaanon (bhojpuri Bhakti Songs) kii bhakthi main dub jate hai
 This time Chhath Puja (chhath Puja) starts from 31 October
 jiskaa samaapan 03november subah surya dev ko arghya dene ke saath hoga
 During this time, not only in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Nepal, also the devotion of Chhathi Maiya will be seen
 bihar main sattarudh endie main sab shant hai lekin sab kuch asaamaanya he
 During the last one week, BJP leaders, especially the Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who went round every day with statements and tweets aimed at 'watering' Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the pretext of water logging, intervened by BJP Working President JP Nadda
 Currently halts after lekin donon dalon ke netaa maanate hai ki sab kuch saamaanya nahin he jiske kaaran kaaryakartaaon main asamanjas kii sthiti he
 However, in the coming days, this tension and a situation of confusion may not affect the promotion of one Lok Sabha seat and five Vidhan Sabha seats and the NDA managed to keep all the seats except Kishanganj assembly seat
 lekin donon dalon main kuch baton ko lekar ab kisi ko sanshay nahin he lekin is vivaad ke jad main kya hai usko lekar abhi maathapai ho rahi he
 One thing is clear from Patna's water system that there are now two factions in Bihar BJP one by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi and the other by Giriraj
 jahaan patna kii baadh or jalajmav se modi kii prashasnic kushalta par sawaal ho rahe hai
 At the same time, former MP Pappu Yadav got very good in the public when Tejashwi Yadav and Sushil Modi and BJP MLA stayed away from relief and rescue work
 giriraaj singh agar har mudde par nitish kumaar ko nishane par rakhkar bol rahe hai to unke peeche party netritv kaa bhi shah mila hua he isko lekar janata dal united (jediu) main bhi ab kisi ko bhram nahin he
 But the behavior of JDU leaders too, especially regarding Home Minister Amit Shah, is like jumping over Laxman Rekha
 is sandarbh main pichley maheene jab enarasi kii report aayi thi tab jediu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor kaa twit bhi amit shah ke rukh se alag tha
 Similarly, BJP does not like to work for Mamata Banerjee through her own company
 haalanki ye prashanth kishor ke liye uplabdhi kii baat ho sakati hai ki bengal main kuch maheene ke kaam ke baad bijepi ko uskaa asar dikhne laga he
 In the same way, BJP is not happy with another newspaper spokesperson Pawan Verma criticizing the BJP for his articles in the newspaper
 ye baat bhi sach hai ki pichley saal patna vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh ke chunaav ke dauraan prashanth kishor kii aakraamak bhoomika or abivipi ke daphtar tak main chhapemari karaane ke baad bihar bijepi ke sabhi varisht netaaon ne nitish se milakar virodh jataayaa jiske baad prashanth kishor ko nitish ne loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari se prachaar tak bilkul alag rakhaa
 Their activism increased after the Lok Sabha elections when Modi and Shah refused to accept representation under Nitish Kumar's formula in government formation
 iske alaava bijepi ke kendriya netritv ko jharkhand main nitish kumaar kii aguwai main vahaan ke mukhyamantri raghubar das ke kilaaf bhaashanbaazi bhi pasand nahin aayi
 However, Janata Dal United leaders say that the BJP forgets that Nitish Kumar did not release his manifesto during the Lok Sabha elections on his request
 saath hi media se is baat par duuri banaae rakhi ki wo baar-baar use vivaadaaspad muddon ke bare main hi baat karenge or jo bhi unka jawaab hoga uskaa har vyakti apane hisaab se arth nikaale jaaenge or kaaryakartaaon main koi asamanjas kii sthiti naa rahe
 If today BJP is aggressor and even after being occupied by the Municipal Development Department of Patna Municipal Corporation for years, if it is blaming Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for water logging, then it is also part of his thoughtful strategy
 janata dal united ke netaa kehete hai ki unke paas bhi feedback he
 Where the polarization has increased in Bihar like other parts of the country after the abolition of Article 370 of the Constitution, if the decision on the issue of Ram temple will come in favor, then the atmosphere can be more favorable for BJP
 aise main bijepi har chote muddon ko pratishtha kaa prashn banaakar sarkaar main rahane ke baavjood mukhyamantri ko gherne kii koshish karegi
 However, the leaders of both BJP and Janata Dal United also believe that the real purpose of this drag is that the politics of pressure has already started for the talks about seats in the assembly elections next year, where BJP says that as Despite winning two seats in the Lok Sabha for the last time, BJP got Nitish Kumar to share the seat equally, then on the basis of the same formula, both parties were equal for the assembly elections

 If you observe Chhath every year, but for some reason you are not able to fast, then you can offer your Prasad to someone else as well
 yahaan tak ki aas-pados main bhi yadi koi vrati he to aap use apana prasad de sakate hai
 That person will offer Prasad to the sixth mother instead of you
 ab tak praapt rujhaanon main desh ke uttar-purv rajyon main bhi bijepi kii aandhi chal rahi he
 BJP is leading from the beginning in 14 Lok Sabha seats here
 puure desh kii baat karen to bijepi nit endie 340 siton par aage he to upie maatr 96 siton par he
 There are other good parties from UPA who are seen losing 106 seats
 uttar purv ke rajyon main bijepi kaa pradarshan agar acha rahaa he to iske peeche neshnal register of citigens (enarasi) or citigens bill ko jimmedaar mana ja saktaa he
 Before the election, there was not only a lot of opposition in the North Eastern states on this issue, but also on the national level
 maamla supreme court tak gaya or vipakshi dalon ne ek saath kai morchon par bijepi ko gheraa
 Despite the uproar, the BJP did not budge in its mission and vowed to implement it
 gauratlab he ki assam sarkaar ne disambar 2013 main enarasi ko apadet karne kii prakriya shuru kii thi
 All the people of the state were asked to present their documents to prove that their families were living in India before March 24, 1971
 baad main iskaa masauda jari hua jisamen 3
 More than 40 lakh people were found to be intruders out of 29 crore applicants
 bijepi ne apni pratikriya main kaha ki bahari logon ko kisi bhi surat main assam ke sansadhano par kabja karne nahin diya jayega
 The BJP also started the process of sending outsiders to their country in which some Rohingya Muslims were sent to Myanmar
 congress or trinmul congress jaise dalon ne iskaa ghor virodh kiya lekin bijepi apane agenda main kaamyaab rahi
 It can be said that this campaign started in Assam also made a good impact in other states of the North East and the issue was successful in generating votes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi khud is mudde par assam main prachaar karte dikhe or kaha ki "jis tarah se modi ne naksaliyon or aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii he, usee tarah se modi ghuspaithiyon ko chhodane nahin ja rahe hai
 On the other hand it will do justice to Chowkidar refugees, who are victims of the Congress's historic lapse
 " modi kaa yah bayaan assam main achook nishaanaa sabit hua dikhataa he kyonki yahaan kii kul 14 siton par bijepi 9 siton par badhat banaae hue he
 The issue of Citizenship Bill was also in the news in the North Eastern states, which the BJP had brought
 vipakshi dalon ne iskaa bhi baari virodh kiya or ek samay aisa kaha ja rahaa tha ki bijepi ko iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Although the counting trends are telling that the way the BJP is leading in the North East, it cannot be said that the issue of Citizenship Bill betrayed the BJP
 yah mudda tab or surkhiyon main aayaa jab sansad main ise lekar baari hangaamaa hua
 However, the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed despite opposition from many opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress
 yah vidheyak bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan ke chah gaiyr muslim alpsankhyak samooh ke logon ko bhartiya naagarikta hasil karne main aa rahi baadhaon ko dur karne kaa prabandh karata he
 The matter grew so much that 11 political parties of the Northeast united against the Citizenship Bill and appealed to the Central Government to repeal it
 duusari ore sarkaar apane iraade par atal rahi lekin uttar purv ke logon ko bharosa jarur dilaayaa ki unke hiton kaa koi nuksaan nahin hua

 Due to family circumstances from Bihar's Gopalganj district, Nitesh, who had been working in a blanket factory for three years in search of livelihood bread, left the army alive and safe after 73 hours from the rubble of a dilapidated building
 is haadase main abtak 14 logon kii maut ho chuki he lekin chaar kii pushti nahin ho saki he
 In the wreckage of the ruined three-storey building where relief and rescuers were hoping to get someone alive, the army pulled out Nitesh (18) with the help of NDRF which is nothing short of a miracle
 duusari ore jiladhikari priyank bharti ne bataaya ki abhi tak 10 shav ko nikaal liya gaya he
 Four more dead bodies found in the wreckage have not been removed yet
 jab tak unhen nikaala nahin jaataa tabatak unke marane kii pushti nahin ho sakati he
 So far 62 have been saved alive
 andiaref ke sahaayak commandent musafir ne bataaya, ‘nitesh ke jivit nikalne ke baad hamane bulldozer kaa kaam rukvaa diya he
 People buried in the debris are likely to be alive
 unka pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Before Nitesh, Sanjeev of his village was evacuated from the debris in the early hours of Wednesday after 50 hours
 nitesh teen saal pehle apana skool chhod kar kaam kii talash main yahaan aayaa tha
 He was accompanied by his brother
 haadase ke vakt vah mashin par kaam kar rahaa tha
 Seven more people were with him
 vah kahaan he iske bare main use pataa nahin
 The army says that when he was evicted, Nitesh said that there are four more people there
 nitesh ne bataaya, ‘achaanak imaarat giri
 We do not know what happened
 kaccha kambal taiyaar hone ke baad hamane use ek par ek sahej kar rakhaa tha
 Meanwhile, the beam dropped and got stuck on the pile of blankets
 main usee ke neeche tha
 'he said,' i kept on sounding
 meri sunne vaala koi nahin tha
 People stuck with me once chanted 'jai Shri Ram'
 uske baad sab kuch shant or andhera
 Slowly everyone's voice stopped
 hamane ummid chod di thi
 Late Wednesday evening, people came in an attempt to remove a dead body
 phir saat ghante ke baad unhone mujhe nikaal liya
 According to Manoj, who is sitting near Nitesh looking after him, he is completely safe
 uske sharir par chot kaa koi nishaan nahin he
 However, he still has the creepy scene in his mind
 vah is bare main baat karne se inkaar kar rahaa he
 "he has no external injuries," says Nitesh's doctors admitted to the trauma center at Sadar Hospital
 phir bhi ham puri tasalli ke baad hi uske bare main kuch kah sakate hai
 He was brought here at half past one on Wednesday
 ’nitesh ne kaha, ‘mujhe laga ki main batch nahin paaunga
 i started making sounds
 haalanki, koi hamaari sudhi lene vaala nahin tha
 Suddenly some people heard my voice
 mujhe pani bheja or nikaalane ke liye surang bananaa shuru kiya
 i was removed by cutting the beam
 ’ aatmavishvaas se labarej is yuva ne raahat or bachaav karmiyon ko kaha ki vah use koi hathiyaar den taaki vah bhi surang banane main unki madad kar sake
 But he was not given it
 phir bhi mashin ke lohe se jitna ban padaa utana apni ore se bhi usne kiya
 'his courage was given to him when the army men made a place for him to come out, then he himself got up and came out
 baahar nikalne ke liye usne strechar kii koi madad nahin lee
 Another doctor at the trauma center says that he is not hurt but he still has a creepy look in his mind
 nitesh ne phir kaha ki vah apane bhai ke saath ab ghar laut jayega
 Actually, his brother was also trapped in this rubble
 nitesh ne nikalate hi apane bhai ke bare main poocha
 He was told that he had been evicted
 haalanki, uski mulaakaat abhi bhai se nahin ho paayi he
 Even if Sri Lanka has won, magar dhoni ne dil jeet liya

 com / sypgu5jgfc Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as the sixth Prime Minister of India at the age of 40 after the assassination of his mother Indira Gand in 1984
 iske saath hi ve desh ke sabase yuva pradhanmantri ban gaye
 On 21 May 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was killed in an explosion at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu
 unki punyatithi ko aatankwaad virdohi diwas ke rup main bhi manaaya jaataa he
 First one story: One time Dhoni gave new players cricket coach M
 pi
 Batting tricks were learned from Singh, learning how to use backlifts, legs and defense
 satr ke baad unhone cricket prashikshak em pi singh se kaha ki ve dobaaraa unhen vah sab sikhaaen
 Singh went to Acchaka
 unhone kaha, ''tum india ke khilaadi ho, shatak maar chuke ho or ye sab ab siikhnaa chaahate ho? dhoni ne sahajata se kaha, ''siikhnaa jaruri he, kabhi bhi ho
 "obviously, the game is in Dhoni's nature and cricket is a natural thing for him
 filmdhoni- da antold storica vah drishy yaad kariye, jab apni motorcykilon kii dekh-rekh karte vakt dhoni vah cheez hasil kar lete hai, jo unako kaamyaab hone se roak rahi thi
 Dhoni is not meant for defensive play
 yahi baat film main bhi unase kahi gai thi, or yahi baat shaayad dhoni ne is baar samaj bhi lee, par is dfa tarika alahada he
 Growing old, he felt that he needed to work on his timing
 dhoni ne apane ballon (vah amuman apni pariyon main do vajan ke alag-alag ballon kaa istemaal karte hai) ke vajan ko kam kar liya he
 This has made their timing better
 or shaayad is vajah se dhoni vahi shots laga paa rahe hai, jiske mureed ham sabhi rahe hai
 Do you remember Visakhapatnam's match against Pakistan in April 2004? Newcomer and shoulder-long wicket-keeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni washed the Pakistanis with washing powder and gave up 148 runs in 123 balls
 phir to aapako 2005 ke aktubar main jaipur vanade kii bhi yaad hogi, jab srilanka ke khilaaf dhoni ne 145 gendon main naabad 183 ran banaae the
 Be it an unbeaten 72-run stand against Pakistan in Lahore in February 2006, or 77 not out from 56 balls in Karachi
 yahaan tak ki 2011 vishwa cap final main bhi aakhri chakka udaate dhoni kaa bhavaheen cheharaa aapke chehre par muskuraahat laa detaa hoga, jab 91 ran kii naabad pari ke liye dhoni ne mahaj 79 gendo kaa saamana kiya tha
 Our same Dhoni seems to be back
 australia ke vanade siries main mahendra singh dhoni apane puraane avatar main dikh rahe hai
 The character has changed a bit
 dhunaai ke ustad, lekin kutai jaraa karaari nahin he
 Now he does not wield a chapar (big knife) like a butcher, now he ferociously snatches like a surgeon
 balla ab aise chal rahaa he jaise chitrakaar canvas par kuchi pher rahaa ho
 The same Dhoni, for whom we have been praising him
 dhoni vahi maahi najar aa rahe hai, jise barason pehle hamane dekha tha, tab, jab unke bal kandhon tak aate the or thode bargandi color main range hote the
 Dhoni was a young man then
 par aaj ke dhoni ke haathon kut-piskar gendbaaj jab gend ko hawa main udakar darshakon ke bich girte dekh rahe hote hai, tab jaakar unhen yakeen hota he ki are, umr ke chauthe dashak main chal rahe adhed dhoni ke haathon main harkulies vaali takat abhi bhi barkaraar he
 And Dhoni is using that power very well
 bas aap australia siries ke duusare vanade ke aakhri or tisare vanade ke 49wein over main ude chakke or chauke main lagi takat ko yaad bhar kar lijie
 In this series, Mahi proved that the big player has to change gears just once
 37 saal kii umr main mahendra singh dhoni ne australia ke khilaaf is vanade siries main kul 193 ran banaae hai or unhen is shandaar pradarshan ke liye 'main of da siries' chunaa gaya
 Earlier Dhoni was dropped by the selectors from the T20 squad against the West Indies and Australia, but Mahi has given a befitting reply to his critics, making a strong comeback against the Kangaroos
 is siries main dhoni do baar naabad rahe or ek baar vah ampire ke behad kharaab faisle kaa shikaar hue the
 Dhoni scored 51 runs in the first match of the 3 match ODI series played in Sydney
 us match main dhoni ko ampire ne elbeadblyoo qaraar de diya jabaki gend leg stump ke baahar pich hui thi
 India lost by 34 runs in Sydney, but Dhoni scored an unbeaten 55 in the second ODI in Adelaide to give India a 6-wicket victory
 melbern main khele gaye siries ke aakhri or nirnaayak match main mahendra singh dhoni ne us halaat main naabad 87 ran banaae jab team india ke top 3 ballebaaj pachaas tak nahin bana paae
 India beat Australia by seven wickets in Melbourne on a 121-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Mahendra Singh Dhoni (87 not out) and Kedar Jadhav (61 not out)
 is aitihaasik jeet ke baad dhoni ko 8 saal baad vanade international siries main 'main of da siries' chunaa gaya
 The last time Dhoni got the title of 'man of the Series' was in the 5-match domestic ODI International series played against England in 2011
 yah dhoni kaa vanade international siries main 7waan 'main of da siries' kaa aword he
 In Melbourne, Dhoni played an unbeaten 87 off 114 balls with the help of six fours while Jadhav scored 61 not out off 57 balls with seven fours
 nijee taur par vaise to viraat kohli ne bhi umdaa khel dikhaaya he, par is baar pehle vanade main kai aalochakon ne dhoni ke dhime khilne par sawaal uthaae the
 But Dhoni still hit Pachasa
 duusare vanade main vah jeet ke khewanhaar rahe or teesraa vanade to ballebaaji main unke hi naam rahaa
 Kedar Jadhav played in his shadow and played better
 jeet ke baad bhi saamaanya bane rahane main dhoni ko agar koi takkar de saktaa he to vah iklauta bhartiya he abhinav bindra
 There is no need to remain calm in cricket, yet Dhoni has lent his personality to his patience with his patience
 yah ek paripakv or sthir mastishk kaa sanket he, jo is baat ko samajhataa he ki kamyaabi koi ek baar main bahak jane vaali cheez nahin, ise lagaataar banaae rakhana padataa he
 Such people are not encouraged
 ve apni khushi ko apane tak rakhte hai, is tarah ausat logon se zyada uplabdhiyaan hasil karte hai
 He has always silenced critics and made his point known to senior players
 unhone chote shaharon kii ek samoochee peedi ke liye prerana kaa kaam kiya he
 It is not easy to describe Dhoni's story in words
 unki pari ab bhi jari he
 Dhoni, who shot the helicopter, has established himself like a rocket this time
 dhoni ke diwane ek dfa khush hai
 Sixes are hitting but not skyscraper
 par kya fark padataa he zyada jor se maaro to bhi boundry ke baahar girti gend kitni bhi dur jaae ran to chah hi milte hai
 Sons of fours are watching the balls open from the rain
 camentator unki tej najar ko dhoni rivyuu system kahkar hairatjada ho rahe hai, to kabhi dhan dhanadhan dhoni kahkar munh baae de rahe hai
 Commentators like Sehwag who once called him Mahendra Bahubali from Thanj are also silent
 khamosh to dhoni bhi hai, par unka balla bol rahaa he
 But this time, classical music, not jazz, is coming off the bat

 aapaki shaadi agar barbaadi main tabdeel ho chuki he, to usase peechha chhudaana ab aasaan ho gaya he
 The Union Cabinet has approved the amendment in the Marriage Act
 iske mutabiktalaak kii arjidene ke baad kai maheenon kaa intjaar jaruri nahin rah jayega
 Some of the highlights of the change in marriage act are: - a new condition has been added to the conditions required for the lock
 agar shaadi kii aisi haalat ho gai he, jisamen sudhaar kii koi gunjaaish na bachi ho, to is shart ke tahat agar patni talaak kii arji detii he, to pati virodh darj nahin kara saktaa
 But if the husband has applied and the wife has lodged a protest, the court will consider it
 -talaak to jaldi milegaa, lekin ab talaak ke baad patni kaa haq aapaki us sampatti par bhi hoga, jo aapane shaadi ke baad jutai he
 Court will decide how much property the wife will get
 -agar talaak hota he, to god liye bachche ke bhi adhikaar bhi thik vaise hi honge, jaise apane paidaa hone vaale bacchon ke hote hai
 The decision was taken in the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 pati kii sampatti main adhikaar dene ke alaava vivaah kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak 2010 kaa uddeshy god liye hue bacchon ko bhi maa-baap se janme bacchon ke samaan adhikaar dilaanaa he
 Two years ago this bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 phir ise kanoon evam carmik sambandhi sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke paas bheja gaya
 On the basis of the recommendations of the Standing Committee, the draft of the Bill was remodeled and approved by the Cabinet, the Bill provides for the equal rights of children born to parents in the event of divorce of husband and wife
 sarkaar ne sansadeey samiti kii is sifarish ko bhi haalanki maan liya he ki talaak kii sthiti main patni kaa pati kii sampatti main adhikaar hoga, lekin kitna hissaa milegaa, yah maamle dar maamle aadhaar par adaalatein tay karengi
 BJP leader Shivkumar Yadav was going from his Fortuner car when the biker miscreants started firing on him
 jaankaree ke anusaar bijepi netaa apane skool se waapas ghar kii taraf laut rahe the
 Then the bike riders opened fire on them

 Video: Hundreds of people attended the last visit of BJP leader Gauhar Ahmed in Kashmir hamale main bijepi netaa shiv kumaar yadav ke saath driver or unke ek surakshakarmi kii maut ho gai
 
 is ghatana ke baad ilaake main sansani fail gai he
 The police is believed to be a mutual scapegoat behind the incident and is now looking for miscreants
 Video- kashmir main bijepi netaa gauhar ahamed kii hatya, antim yatra main shaamil hue saikadon log The driver and one of his security personnel along with BJP leader Shiv Kumar Yadav were killed in the attack
 
 After this incident, sensation has spread in the area

 In the politics of Uttar Pradesh, the SP and the BSP have come together and done something that happened about 25 years ago, but this time they come together
 yah gathbandhan bhartiya raajnneeti kii tasviir badalane vaala he
 Both Mayawati and Akhilesh decided to come together, bypassing their egos
 uttarapradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party 38-38 siton par chunaav ladengi
 Also, no candidate will stand in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 yahi nahin ek-ek seat kuch choti partiyon ke liye bhi chodi gai hai
 There is also room for Ajit Singh in this alliance
 unhen samaajawaadee party apane cote se bhi seat degi
 This means that in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP currently has 68 seats, the SP-BSP alliance has tightened the contest
 yadi aap desh ke paanch rajyon jisamen uttar pradesh,bihar, maharashtra,pashchim bengal or tamilnadu kii loksabhaa siton ko jod den to kareeb 250 siten baithti hai
 Now let's see how the BJP is in these states
 uttarapradesh main bijepi ko 2014 main sabase badi safalataa mili thi
 It won 70 of the 80 seats
 yah silsilaa 2017 main bhi jari rahaa jab bijepi ne vidhansabha chunaav main shandaar jeet darj kii or yogi kii sarkaar bani
 But since then, the bjp's graph has been falling
 khaskar jab mukhyamantri or up mukhyamantri kii seat par hue upachunaav main bijepi ne gorakhpur or phulpur donon siten haar gai
 Later in Kairana, the BJP was defeated as the opposition gathered against the BJP
 yahi haal sapa or basapa milakar 2019 main bijepi kaa karne vaali hai, aisa kai rajnatik jaankaar maanate hai
 Now let's talk about Bihar
 yahaan jediu, bijepi or algepi gathbandhan ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan majbootee se khadaa he
 Here RJD, Congress, Kushwaha and Jitanram Manjhi are there and the vote share is going up to 40%
 yani bihar kii 40 siton par bhi ladaai jabardast hone vaali he
 Maharashtra has 48 seats
 yahaan congress or ensipi saath milakar chunaav ladengi, yah tay ho chukaa he
 But it is not certain whether Shiv Sena and BJP will fight together
 isi tarah pashchim bengal main 42 siten hai
 The BJP has two seats
 yadi vah chaar bhi ho jaaen to koi zyada fark nahin padegaa
 There are 39 seats in Tamil Nadu, where BJP has only one seat, the rest is occupied by AIADMK i
e
 Jayalalithaa's party
 to kya bijepi ediemke ke saath jaaegi? yah abhi pakkaa nahin he
 On the other hand, the alliance of DMK and Congress is firm
 jaankaar maanate hai ki diemke or congress kii jeet yahaan pakki he
 That is, there is not much encouraging news for the BJP in these 250 Lok Sabha seats
 batch gai karnataka kii 27 siten, jahaan congress or jedies kaa gathbandhan saath chunaav ladega
 Then BJP seems to save even its current 15 seats, it does not appear
 haa congress-jedies gathbandhan loksabhaa chunaav se pehle tut jaaen to baat kuch or ho sakati he
 Similarly, BJP holds all 25 seats in Rajasthan
 ab vahaan sarkaar badal chuki he to jaahir he bijepi sabhi 25 siten to nahin hi jeet sakati he
 Similarly, BJP is in possession of 26 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh, but now there are Kamal Naths who will not let BJP repeat their old performance
 jaahir he 2019 main bijepi ke liye kam se kam kaagaj par siton kaa akaal najar aata he
 Yes, if he finds an issue that causes a ripple in his favor, then it could be something else
 iske liye aapako chand maheenon tak intjaar karnaa padegaa
 By the way, it is certain that the 2019 Lok Sabha election is going to be very interesting and fun

 Bareilly District Collector Captain Raghavendra Vikram Singh had posted a post on Facebook on the Kasganj incident
 unke 39 shabdon ke is chote se post ke baad vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 During that time UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had said that action would be taken against DM
 bareli ke jiladhikari captain raghavendra ne 28 janvari ko apane post main likhaa tha, "ajab rivaaj ban gaya he
 Take forceful processions in Muslim neighborhoods and shout slogans of Pakistan Murdabad
 kyon bhai ve pakistani hai kya? yahi yahaan bareli main khaylam main hua tha
 Then there was stone pelting, lawsuits were written
 
 
 " Can there be any philosophical aspect related to stone or stone? Or can any stone even speak? This question can come to your mind when you come to the ghats of Kashi, built on the banks of the Ganges, the North Mother
 yahaan aisa kya he ki maa ganga bhi in ghaaton se aisi bahati hai maano vilaas kar rahi he
 Starting from Assi Ghat in Banaras, when you reach Tulsi Ghat, Chet Singh Ghat, Adi Keshav Ghat, Dashashwamegh Ghat, Manikarnika Ghat, you will feel that you have gained a lot and made of stone
 These ghats have already told you about the life here
 assi ghat se raja ghat tak lagbhag 4 mile ke vistaar main faile 84 ghat balua pattharon se ardhachandrakaar aakaar main kuch is tareeke se banaae gaye hai maano aap kisi ardhachandrakaar mukt akashiya manch par jivan kii satyata dekh rahe honti hamaari ye soch tab or paripakv ho jaati he jab aap ganga ke kinare gwalior ke peshwa se lagaayat rajasthan or bengal ke raison ke ghat ek qatari main dekhte hai
 Perhaps our thinking of omnidirectional and all-encompassing has been preserved in these tall high-rise buildings built on these ghats and perhaps this same thinking has taken place from time to time in the calm atmosphere between the platform of these ghats on the banks of the North Ganges mother Ganga and the waves of the Ganges
 But sometimes gave words to the mind of Tulsi, sometimes made Kabir and Raidas realize the truth of life, sometimes Pandit Kanthe Maharaj, Kishan Maharaj's tabla, and sometimes Bismillah's shehna Became mesmerized the whole world
 yahi soch gudai mahraaj, sitara devi, girizaa devi jaise darjanon sangeet marmagyon kii gale kii taan or ghunghruon kii jhankaar ban kar in ghaaton ko hameshaa zankrut karatin he
 The craze of these pictures that speak to the ghats saved by these great men of their ghats, is speaking to the heads of photographers all over the world today
 lihaaja banaras main in dinon photo tourism teji se badha he or duniya bhar ke photographer camere kii nigahon se banaras ko dekhne aa rahe hai
 Not only this, in the competition of street photography to be held in the world, only photographer from Benaras was selected second in the street photographer category
 banaras ke ghaaton kii kisi bhi angel se khinchi hui tasviren ghaaton kii zindagi ko bayaan karti nazar aati hai
 Photographers from all over the world will be seen strolling these ghats of Benares to imprison these spoken pictures in their cameras
 inhen main se ek england se ai karen or dezi he jo in dinon banaras ke har pahalu ko hameshaa ke liye camere main qaid kar rahi hai
 Karen and Daisy say that it is the most beautiful place in the world in terms of photography
 jahaan lite bahut acchhee he, ek dam soft, ye bahut puraani nagari he or yahaan ke log bahut achche hai
 This uniqueness of Banaras lies not just in its ghats but also in its streets
 jahaan deevaaron par bani masabari kala ke chitra or gharon kii puraani banaavat in photographeron ko unke man pasand subject uplabdh karaate hai
 This is the reason that the steps of these foreign cinematographers fall in these streets as well and they seem desperate to imprison the life here in their camera
 pehle tourist yahaan sirf ghoomane aata tha, ab ek nai cheez ai he
 Every tourist now comes here as a photographer and every photographer now wants to come here and ask for help because nothing more beautiful than this is found in the world
 banaras main ye photography tourism nae jamaane kii dein he
 Because the pictures here on whatsapp, Facebook, social media started reaching the world through the photographers like Street photographer Vinay and Manish
 jab isaki shoharat hui to baqayada ek photo walker group ban gaya
 In which Manish made colorful photographs of different lives of his ghats, making him the second number street photographer in the world in street photography competition held in the world
 tippaniyan This photo tourism has also created a new demand, that is photo tourist guide
 jise manish or vinay jaise banaras ke photographer bina kisi paise ke puraa kar rahe hai
 It means to say that these ghats of Banaras speak not of lifeless stone, they also speak, so the first thing we realized is that these Ghats must have given words to the mind of Tulsi, sometimes Kabir and Raidas should have a life
 Must have made the realization of the truth, then at some time the beat of Pandit Kanthe Maharaj, Kishan Maharaj's tabla would have given new height
 or aaj yahi ghat apni bolti tasveeron se duniya bhar ke photographeron ko na sirf mantrmugdh kiye hue hai balki unhen apni taraf khinch bhi rahe hai
 And this is also the life of the Ghats of Banaras, then only Nazir Banarsi says that the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes back to me; yahaan aisa kya he ki maa ganga bhi in ghaaton se aisi bahati hai maano vilaas kar rahi he

 The same thinking always chimes these ghats by becoming the taunts of the throats and throats of dozens of music admirers like Gudai Maharaj, Sitara Devi, Girja Devi
 apane mahapurushon ke inhi jhankaar ko saheje ghaaton kii bolti in tasveeron kaa craij aaj duniya bhar ke photographeron ke sir chadh kar bol rahaa he
 Hence photo tourism has increased rapidly in Banaras these days and photographers from all over the world are coming to see Banaras with the eyes of the camera
 itnaa hi nahin duniya main hone vaali street photography kii pratiyogita main banaras ke hi photographer, street photographer category main duusare nambar par chune gaye
 Photographs taken from any angle of the Ghats of Benares are seen to describe the life of the Ghats
 inhi bolti tasveeron ko apane camere main qaid karne ke liye duniya bhar ke photographeron ke qadam banaras ke in ghaaton par chahalqadami karte dikh jaaenge
 One of them is Karen and Daisy from England who are incarcerating every aspect of Banaras in camera these days
 karen or dezi kahati hai ki photography ke lihaaj se ye duniya kii sabase khubasurat jagah he
 Where the light is very good, absolutely soft, it is a very old city and the people here are very good
 banaras kaa ye anoothaapan sirf uske ghaaton main nahin balki uski galiyon main bhi he
 Where the paintings of the Musbari art on the walls and the old texture of the houses provide these subjects to their favorite subjects
 yahi vajah he ki in videshi chhayakaaron ke qadam in galiyon main bhi padate hai or wo yahaan kii jeevantata ko apane camere main qaid karne ke liye betaab nazar aate hai
 Previously tourists used to visit here only, now a new thing has come

 The comments is photo tourism ne ek nai demand bhi paidaa kii he, wo he photo tourist guide kii

 usee ke chuninda ansh aap bhi padhenjaisa ki aapane bhoomika main bhi likhaa he ki gita ke subject or iske vistaar ko dekhte hue pehle aap peeche hat gaye the
 How did i start this work again in 2008
 Comparative study of literature has been in my nature
 bie main form bharte vakt angreji, urdu or arabi litarechar bhar diya
 That is, this thing was sitting in nature somewhere
 islam ko padhaa to sochaa ki hindu dharm kii kitaaben bhi padhpsi chahie
 So read parts of Gita, Ramcharitmanas and Upanishads
 gita padhate vakt laga ki isamen bahut-si baaten aisi hai jo quran or paigambar ke hadison main bhi hai
 In the last 150 years, there have been 24 lines of Gita
 par wo jamaana percianised urdu kaa tha
 Hardly 8-10 books were found
 sochaa kyon na main ise jan saamaanya kii bhashaa main dhaal duun
 It seemed that in easy language it can be taught to both Hindus and Muslims
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aapane shloke ko lok tak pahunchane kaa tulsi jaisaa kaam kiya he lekin morari baapu kehete hai ki nahin, yah aapane vedavyas kaa kaam kiya he, tulsi kaa kaam to tab hoga jab aap maanas ko bhi urdu shaayari main dhaal den
 Now? Bapu saw that when a man can communicate Gita in easy language, he can also do psyche
 unhen mere tallent par itnaa vishwaas tha ki unhone isharatan dua ke taur par mujhase ek baat kah di
 Bapu gave me a sacred work for the rest of my life
 par gita sanskrit main he or sanskrit aapaki bhashaa nahin rahi he
 This is the period when you will find a large literature in dozens of languages
 gita ke 5-6 urdu anuwaad mere paas hai
 There are also Hindi and English
 lekin gita par osho rajnish kii tikaa (gita darshan) se main bahut mutassir hua
 i would read a verse
 us par osho, (lokmaanya) tilak or ajmal khan sahab vagairah kii tikaaen dekhtaa
 After reading them, i would make poetry with the squeeze of the feeling that came to my mind: first the words, then the eraser and then the lion
 osho se mutassir hone kaa kya arth?pehle hi pehle shloke main andhe dhritarashtra sanjay se poochhate hai ki maidan main kya ho rahaa he? maine yun shuru kiyah dhritarashtra ankhon se maharoom the, magar ye na samajhe ki maasoom the
 Its second line is given by Rajneesh
 ve kehete hai ki andhe hone se ye na samajhie ki vasanaayen-icchhaaen khatm ho jaati hai
 The Gita has a special point: there is a lot of base
 uskaa ek shloke, arth or vyakhya padhie, aath din baad phir padhie, tab kuch or arth mil jayega
 The way the analysis of human psychology in Shakespeare's dramas might have become a big thing, i think Shakespeare must have read the Gita
 gita kaa is tarah kaa anuwaad karne ke idia par aapke paas feedback kya tha?aath baras pehle maine (jalalpur main) apane college main kahin yah baat kah di thi
 a channelist took this opinion from both the eldest of the Shias in Lucknow, Kalim Sadiq and Sunni Alim Khalid Rashid

 Muslim intellectuals also investigated
 is tarah ke bade granthon ke kavyanuwaad main mul kaa dhaancha or uski style kii jakadaaa haaavee rahati he
 You have broken it
 yah aakhir kaise sambhav hua?dekhie, jab kisi darshan se, kisi falsafe se, vyakti se yaa ideology se aapako ishk ho jaae, ishk main badi pavitrataa he or aakhri seemaa tak jane kaa sangharsh he
 So i liked the style in which Krishna speaks in the Gita
 yahi quran kaa divine style he
 God says to humans that this world, this mountain, this land, this sky, this moon and sun
 
 
 agar ye meraa jalawaa nahin, ye meri nishaniyaan nahin to kiski hai? bataao i insaanon, meri koun koun-si nematon ko jhuthlaaoge? krishna isi style main bolte hai
 This complete presentation of the Gita in Urdu poetry is deeply insistent on teaching it
 main tay kar chukaa tha ki ise itnaa aasaan bana duungaa ki hindi or urdu vaale, donon ise apni hi bhashaa kaa kahen
 a word came asrar, i
e
 mystery
 mujhe laga hindi waalon ko samajhane main dikkat hogi
 So i used Raj

 You consider yourself to be a man of wonder and those with literature rely on effort

 In view of this trend, Google has celebrated this festive season by writing Happy Holiday
 desh-videsh main christmas kii dhooma, aadhi raat ko girijagharon main prarthanabata den ki duniyabar main har saal 25 disambar christmas de ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The person of every religion celebrates the biggest festival of Christianity

 ek tej dhoop vaali subah shahatut ke pedo kii qatari ke bich bane ek sankare raste par mor panktibaddh hokar chalate najar aate hai

 The swarm of bees is affixed to a hive
 batakh apni adaa main dagamagaate hue chal rahe hai
 Situated in Patan Kala in Alwar district of Rajasthan, 90 km from Delhi, this 40-acre idyllic farm has some animals for sale
 lekin batakh to bilkul nahin beche jate
 "these ducks are my natural pest controllers," says Ayesha Grewal, owner of Organic Acres Farm
 ” par aakhir kaise? asal main batakh machharon kaa pupa khate hai
 They also eat snails and other insects, which keeps many vegetables and other vegetables from this farm safe
 is farm main salad pattey kii 13 prajatiyaan ugaai jaati hai, jinamein boston, bib, lola rosa or batavia shaamil hai
 Apart from these, white turnips, golden beetroots (beetroot), Caribbean chillies like Scotch bannets, asparagus, artchokes, fennel and Japanese algae okahiziki are also grown
 hindustan main is tarah kii saag-subjiyon ko videsh kaa kuch khaas mana jaataa he
 Till recently, none of these was cultivated here
 desh ke bade-bade restaraan salad pattiyon se lekar europea subjiyon tak aisi har cheez kaa videsh se hi aayaat karte the
 All of this exercise was meant to attract wealthy customers who could pay huge sums for non-hybrid tomatoes such as arugula and baby radish salad or bruschetta (bruschetta refers to tomatoes whose seeds have typically been sourced for generations
 Have been)
 videshi saag-subjiyon kii hindustan main kheti kaa chalan vaise pichley teen saal main kaaphi teji se badha he
 The number of farms cultivating green vegetables and vegetables of foreign variety has also increased rapidly, especially in Manesar (in Haryana near Delhi), Pune, Bangalore and Mysore

 haalanki, greval kii tarah iske zyaadaatar kisaan chote str par shuruyaat kii vajah se kaaphi teji se vruddhi kaa aankada dekh paa rahe hai
 The reason for this is not difficult to know
 desh kii yuva aabaadi kii vajah se restaraan industry kaaphi teji se bad rahi he
 Such young people are having an increase in their income and the trend of eating and drinking outside is increasing
 duniya bhar ke tarah-tarah ke khan-paan ke prati jaagrukta bhi bad rahi he
 According to a study by the National Restaurant Association of India and Technopak, the food service market in India was around $ 48 billion in 2013

 raja bhaiya badi safagoi se kehete hai ki unhone kabhi jail mahakme kii maang nahi rakhi thi lekin haa man main yah mahakama paane kii khwaahish jarur thi
 Raja Bhaiya, while speaking to reporters late on Tuesday night said, "the jail did not ask for anything but there was a desire in the mind that if i get this secret then i can do something for the betterment of the prisoners based on the experience spent in the jail
 "unhone kaha, "main jail kii rag-rag se waakif hum kyonki main basapa sarkaar ke do kaarykalon ke dauraan 26 maheene jail main bitaa chukaa hum
 "he said," In jail, i have seen how people stay in jails for more than the prescribed time in lieu of not depositing the fine
 meri koshish yahi hogi ki jail main band har kaidi ko ve suvidhaayen or adhikaar milen jinke ve hakdaar hai
 "he said that due to non-payment of fines, help of ngos will be taken to take out the people in jails
 unhone aparaadhiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki rasookh kaa istemaal kar jelon main najaaij tareeke se suvidha hasil karnaa ab aasaan nahin hoga, iske liye kade kadam uthaae jaaenge
 He said, "jails are basically reform houses but in Uttar Pradesh the jails have been converted into torture houses and i have to change this perception
 kai baar kaidi isliye dam tod dete hai kyonki unhen sardiyon main ek kambal tak naseeb nahin hota
 The level of what you get in the name of food is very poor
 "raja bhaiya ke rasookh kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki nirdaleey vidhayak hote hue bhi vah sapa kii sarkaar main cabinet mantri kaa darja paane main safal rahe
 Mayawati had taken many tough decisions against Raja Bhaiya during her tenure due to which she had to go to jail
 a post shared by Nora Fatehi (@norafatehi) on Jun 26, 2018 at 8:12am PDT More than 350 people have died due to the biggest floods of the century in Kerala

 In fact, in the affidavit filed by the Kerala government in the Supreme Court, it has been said that after the water level in Mullaperiyar Dam has risen due to sudden release of water

 Then suddenly the release of water from the Mullaperiyar dam forced the Kerala government to release more water from the Idukki district

 The Kerala government said in an affidavit filed in the court that a total of around 3 from Kerala due to this flood
 48 karod kii aabaadi main se 54 lakh se adhik log baadh se prabhavit hue hai
 The state government said that the state water resources secretary had written a letter to his counterpart in the Tamil Nadu government and to the monitoring committee of Mullaperiyar Dam, requesting that the water level of the reservoir reach its maximum level due to its engineers being warned in advance
 The process of releasing water should be controlled without waiting
 kerala sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki aisi sthiti kii punrariti rokane ke liye nigaraanee samiti kii kaman kendriya jal ayog ke adhyaksh ko saunpi jaae or donon rajyon ke sachivon ko iskaa sadsy banaaya jaae
 This committee should be empowered to take a majority decision at the time of flood or any such crisis
 kerala sarkaar ne mullaperiyar baandh ke rojaanaa ke sanchaalan ke prabandhan ke liye bhi ek prabandh samiti gathit karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Explain that the state government has filed this affidavit in this case as directed by the apex court on August 18
 unhone kaha, ‘‘tambaakoo se har saal kshetra main 13 lakh logon kii maut ho jaati he, jo 150 maut prati ghante ke baraabar he

 Jagmohan Dalmiya may have been known as Jaggu Da among his fans, but he was known as Machiavelli and Master of Realpolitik of Indian cricket
 ye niknem bhartiya cricket board main unki haisiyat ko bataata he
 In fact, today India is the world's largest market of cricket, and India's dominance in world cricket is looking strong, so Dalmiya contributed a lot in it

 There is a saying when Rome was burning Nero was playing flute
 The same situation is in the capital Delhi
 The capital Delhi is going through a big crisis at the moment but our leaders are that they have nothing to do with this situation in Delhi at this time
 The kind of air pollution and the kind of data that is being received, it can be said that Delhi is currently the most polluted city in the world
 The finer particle than PM2
 5 kaa level saamaanya ke mukaable 12 se 14 guna tak pahunch gaye isi tarah piem 10 kii maatra dilli kii hawa main surakshit str ke mukaable 8 guna se zyada darj kiye gaye
 This situation has not been made in 1 day
 It has been 12 days since the capital of the capital has become so toxic
 jimmedaar koun, kendra yaa dilli ?ab sawaal uthta he kya is sthiti ke bare main centre or rajya sarkaar ko pataa nahin tha yaa unke paas is baat ko jaanane kaa koi jariya nahin tha ki dilli kii hawa itani jahrili hone ja rahi he
 The simple answer to this is that government agencies were constantly informing the Modi government and Kejriwal's government about this
 centre sarkaar kii baat karen to unke paas mausam vibhaag se aane vaali jaankaree ke saath hi central polution control board se milane vaale purvanumaan bhi the
 In addition, under the Safar Program of the Environment Division of the Meteorological Department, frequent forecasts have been issued for this situation which are accurate to an extent
 to vahiin duusari taraf dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ke paas dilli polution control board se milane vaale purvanumaan or mausam vibhaag se milane vaale purvanumaan maujuud the lekin in purvanumaanon ko koi tavajjo nahin di gai
 The governments failed to understand the meteorological department's warning
 On 26 October, the American Space Agency NASA released a picture of the fire being planted in the paddy fields in the plains of India, and this made it clear that this time also like last year The smoke emanating from Punjab will show its color in North India
 mausam vibhaag ke vaigyanikon ko is baat kaa andaja tha ki aane vaale dinon main dilli samet uttar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main kaisaa mausam hone ja rahaa he
 The Meteorological Department usually has accurate information about 15 days and this is known by the Central Government as well as the State Government
 lekin mausam kii gambhirtha ko har baar kii tarah is baar bhi sarkaar samajhane main naakaam rahi he
 Every weather parameter was indicating that there is going to be a tremendous increase in air pollution in the capital around Diwali
 in sabake baavjood centre sarkaar kii is agency ne logon ko ehtiyaat baratane kii koi chetavanee jari nahin kii, mausam vibhaag ne apane enwyrement divijan ke safar program ke tahat safar kii website par 3 dinon kii chetavanee ko lagaae rakhaa
 The Meteorological Department did not understand the need to warn people by advertising such a dangerous situation in newspapers and TV
 yani un logon ko jinako is baat kaa mandet he ki vah desh ke logon ko mausam se jude hue khataron ke bare main logon ko pehle se jaankaree den unhone is jimmedaari ko sahi tareeke se nahin nibhaayaa
 The Punjab and Central Governments were sleeping, what steps did the central government take? Despite the pictures of burning the field from the satellite, the Modi government sitting in Delhi and the Badal government sitting in Punjab kept sleeping
 baat baat main centre sarkaar ko kosne vaale mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal modi or badal sarkaar kii tarah is maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajhane main naakaam rahe
 After Diwali, when smog conditions were created in all areas of Delhi NCR, everyone felt that it is a matter of few days that there is pollution of Deepawali
 lekin aisa nahin hua aisa nahin hoga is baat kii puri jaankaree mausam vibhaag ko thi
 But no government department asked him nor did he bother that he would alert any administrative staff, everything continued to depend on Ram
 paryaavaran mantri ne bulaai sachivon kii baithkajab yah sthiti control se baahar hoti dikhi media main khabaren aane lagi to achaanak soi hui sarkari jaag uthi, phir kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ne dilli or iske aas paas ke rajyon ke sachivon ke saath meeting bula lee
 In the meeting, more than two and a half hours were discussed, all the issues were discussed and the environment secretary AK Jha informed that all the issues have been discussed and it has come out in this conversation that during the smog last year, Jin 42 On the points, there was agreement among the states of delhi-ncrk that the state governments have implemented Lahwali to implement them all
 dilli ensiaar main bade hue pradooshan ke chalate centre sarkaar ne central polution control board ko 17 sabase zyada pradooshan failaane vaale ughogon ke kaarkaanon ko check karne kii baat kahi
 Apart from this, the State Governments who spoke to the Delhi Government on pollution spreading from the Badarpur Thermal Power Plant were also asked to strictly follow all the rules and laws related to the environment
 yani kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki ek gambhir samasya ke liye sirf sarkari meeting kii tarah lagi
 Steps taken under pressure from the NGT: Amidst the pressure of the NGT and the hue and cry over the pollution, the Kejriwal government of Delhi finally took many steps in Anand Phanan
 sthiti yahaan tak ho gai centre sarkaar ko har maamle main kosne ke liye badnaam kejariwal ne is baar bhi kasar nahin chodi patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue unhone rajdhani dilli ke upar kritrim barish karne kii sambhaavna kaa bhi zikr kar daalaa or kaha iske liye centre sarkaar se baat karenge
 Do not understand what kind of government it is and how people are advising them, Common Sense says that at least clouds will be needed to make artificial rain but Kejriwal has started planning for rainless clouds
 Explain that this is the post-monsoon season and the rains are due to western disturbances and when there is an anti cyclone circulation over Delhi, then Clouds place are not formed, the Kejriwal government has also failed to realize the gravity of the situation
 sarkaron kaa haal to bahut bura he, lekin is baat kii chetavanee koun jari karegaa ki itane oonche pradooshan level medical immergency he
 There is also a Punjab election
 In Punjab, assembly elections are going to be held in the coming days and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is preparing to harvest his votes in Punjab
 aise main vah bhala punjab ke kisaanon ko dilli ke pradooshan ke liye kaise jimmedaar tehra sakate hai
 Therefore, all such steps are being taken that the increased pollution of Delhi cannot be reduced quickly
 On the other hand, the Union Minister of Environment of Delhi met the Chief Ministers of the States of Delhi NCR and discussed all steps to reduce air pollution
 lekin is baithak main bhi punjab ke upar koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya ki vah apane kisaanon ko kheton main aag lagane se roke
 The case here is also about the harvest of votes in the next assembly elections in Punjab
 aise main mausami paristhitiyaan badalane ke alaava or doosraa koi vikalp nahin he
 Winds are changing and pollution is decreasing but they are still well above safe levels
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue siarpief ke javaanon par aatanki hamale ke baad se hi bharat or pakistan ke bich tanatani kaayam he
 Since the Pulwama terror attack, Pakistan has accused the Indian Air Force of violating the Line of Control between the two countries
 pakistan ne bharat par aarope lagaate hue daawa kiya he ki bhartiya vayusena ne elosi ko paar kiya he
 Explain that 40 soldiers were martyred in the Pulwama terror attack, the attack of which is claimed by the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed

 According to which, Pakistan has claimed that the Indian Air Force violated the Line of Control, soon after which the Pakistani Air Force responded and the Indian Air Force aircraft went back

 Earlier, the Pakistan Army on Monday targeted forward posts and border areas near the Line of Control in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistani sena ne pichley hafte main chah din un ilaakon main sangharshaviram kaa ulanghan kiya
 a defense spokesman said that Indian troops have given him a befitting reply
