 There is a special emphasis on the five elements in the Hindu tradition
 ham prithvi ,jal, agni, akaash or vaayu sabame ishwar kaa ansh dekhte hai
 Of these five elements, Agni is considered the most sacred
 agni ke pratik ke rup main deepak ko sabase zyada moolyawaan or pavitra mana jaataa he
 The significance of Deepak is so much that, we also celebrate "diwali", a whole festival of lamps
 ham ishwar ko prakaash ke rup main maanate hai
 Hence, lighting a lamp, meditating on God as its light
 deepak se man ekagra hota he or ekagra man se kii gayi prarthana sweekrut hoti he
 The month of Kartik is special for the lamp donation
 is maheene main alag alag mukhon ke deepak jalaakar ham apni alag-alag manokamanaayon ko puraa kar sakate hai
 a Mukhi lamp is normally lit with a Mukhi lamp before every pooja recitation and chanting
 is deepak main do batiyaan hoti hai jisamen se sirf ek sira jalaayaa jaataa he
 Any puja can be worshiped by lighting such a lamp
 is tarah ke deepak ko jalaane se ishwar kii krupa saralata se mil sakati he
 These lamps are lit under the basil plant throughout the month of Kartik
 Two lamps are not lit normally
 is deepak kaa prayog swasthya or aayu raksha ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Such lamps also have two things, in which two ends are lit
 karthik maas main shiv ji ke samaksh do mukhi deepak jalaayenaisa karne se aayu or swasthya kii samasyaon se raksha hogidhyaan rakhen ki deepak ghi kaa hona chahie
 Three-faced lamp Three-faced lamp is very beneficial in special conditions
 is tarah ke deepak ko jalaane se shatru baadha or virodhiyon kii samasya dur ho jaati he
 This type of lamp also has two things and three heads are lit
 is deepak main sarson kaa tel bharne se sheeghra laabh hoga
 Four-faced lamp is lit to fulfill special wishes of four types
 dhan prapti, grah dosha nivaaran or siddhi praapt karne ke liye is deepak kaa sabase zyada prayog hota he
 This type of lamp has two things and all four lights are lit
 is tarah kaa deepak mukhya puja sthaan par jalaayaa jaataa he or yah jitna bada ho utana hi acha hota he
 Make sure that ghee will be filled in the lamp
 agar karthik maas main ye deepak maa lakshmi ke saamne nity jalaayaa jaay to, dhan sambandhi samasyaayein dur hoti hainchh mukhi deepaksantan kii prapti or santan sambandhi samasyaon ke nivaaran ke liye chah mukhi deepak jalaayaa jaataa he
 This type of lamp consists of three things and the six ends of these lamps are lit
 is deepak ko agar pati patni ek saath jalaaen to santan sambandhi samasyaon kaa nivaaran aasaani se ho jaataa he
 Those couples who have any problem related to their children should light a six-faced lamp in front of Ganesha

 Senior Congress and BJP leaders are busy campaigning loudly
 vahiin duusari taraf jod-tod kii bhi har mumkin koshishon raajnneetik dalon ke bich dekhne ko mil rahi hai
 But the Congress has not yet received any major leadership in this direction

 Asked whether he would join hands with the Congress or share the stage with Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Jignesh said, "we will not share the stage with any political party
" bhale hi vah congress hi kyon na ho
 Not only did Jignesh shock the Congress at the snub on the BJP, he also severely criticized the BJP
 unhone kaha ki ham gujarat main vikaas par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai, lekin bijepi sex sidi relies karnaa or us par charchaa karne main lagi he
 Jignesh has also accused the BJP of giving communal color to the election, questioning the development model of Gujarat

 " ullekhneey he ki sharapova pichley 10 varsho se swasthya sambandhi pareshaaniyon ke kaaran 'meldonium' dawa (jise 'mildronet' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he) kaa seven kar rahi thim, jise wada dwaara ek janvari 2016 se nishiddh dawaaon kii suchi main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The comments sharapova kaa kahana he ki unhen is bare main jaankaree nahin thi

 i should have paid more attention to it

 You have heard the mention of Wahhabi Islam in all the debates in this context
 iske liye aapako polytical islam jaise shabdon ke maane samajhane honge
 That means the creation of political power on the basis of religion, which will run from Sharia and not the Constitution
 motaa moti ise polytical islam kah sakate hai
 The comments wahaab islam ko aap yun samajhiye ki sthaneey samskruti or samaaj ke asar ko samaapt kar pavitra kitaab ke anuroop hi aacharan kiya jaae
 Saudi Arabia is said to be a preacher of Wahhabi Islam, but there are many variations of the holy stream of Islam
 jaise bharat main aap tabalig or wahaab ko ek nahin kah sakate
 In the same way, you have to be very careful about whether you can call Wahhabi Islam and Saudi Wahab in India
 kya bharat kaa wahabi musalmaan bhi saudi yaa islamic state se jude wahabi yaa salphi musalamaanon kii tarah raajnneetik satta ke liye ladata he
 All these questions are important
 yah bhi ki islamic state main shaamil kya saare aatankwaadi wahabi dhara se hi aate hai
 You know that there are different types of spin in Islam
 panth hai
 Every sect also has a fight with each other
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf masjidon main takreer kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 But the Islamic State is getting youth from online
 kya online par kuch or he jiske prabhaav main noujvaan prabhavit ho rahe hai
 This should also be a question

 aatankwaad ke khilaaf masjidon main takreer kaa elaan kiya gaya he

 kya online par kuch or he jiske prabhaav main noujvaan prabhavit ho rahe hai
 This should also be a question
 to masjidon main apil or takreer kaa elaan kar muslim sansthaaen bachaav kii mudra main hai yaa wo america, rus or france kii madad kar rahi hai, aatankwaad se ladane main prime time
 There have been more than 400 raids and 60 arrests since Friday's attack in Paris
 75 hathiyaar baraamad hue hai
 France has said that the Radical Mosques will be closed
 rus ke raashtrapati ne ek ayog kaa gathan kiya he jo pataa lagayegaa ki aatankwaad ko koun paise de rahaa he
 They want to know who funded the Russian plane that exploded on 31 October
 islamic state ne us hamale kii zimmedaari lee thi lekin is faisle par pahunchane ke liye kya putin ko paris hamale ne prabhavit kiya yaa ve un 40 deshon ke bare main or pataa lagaana chaahate hai jo unke mutabik islamic state ko fund kar rahe hai
 If you search the answers to all these questions, who created the Islamic State, who gave the money, then you will get Obama's statement from Google that the Muslim society is not taking enough steps to stop the extremists
 yah sunate hi bharat ke muslim sanghathan turant sakriy ho gaye jaise obama ji ke aagrah kaa intazaar ho rahaa tha
 Jamiat Ulema Hind has demonstrated against terrorism in many cities of India today
 kaha he ki islam kaa ISIS se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Jamiat has proclaimed jihad against terrorism and appealed to Muslim countries to join it
 moulana mahmud madani ne kaha ki kuch log brain vaash karne kii koshish kar rahe hai lekin ham log kattar takaton ke khilaaf ladenge
 You know that in 2013, Jamiat organized a fatwa by gathering against terrorism at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 usase pehle 2008 main daarul ulum devband ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf fatwa jari kiya tha
 Some time ago an organization named Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith also held a public meeting at Ramlila Maidan in which fatwas were read against terrorism
 is sabha main gaiyr muslim dharm guru bhi shaamil hue the
 In 2015, Ahle Hadith issued a fatwa against Dais ie Islamic State
 2006 main aatankwaad ke khilaaf jari fatve ko ek kitaab kii shakl main chapa gaya he
 In Mumbai, Mufti Mohammad Manjar Hasan Ashrafi said that he had issued a fatwa from the US in the month of September that Islam is against terrorism
 is fatve par 1070 mufti or imam ne dastakhat kiye hai
 The Raza Academy in Mumbai has announced that it will appeal to all mosques and clerics to call IS a terrorist organization
 ek maheenaa pehle bengaluru ke jama masjid ne karnataka kii 6000 masjidon ke imam ko khat likhaa he ki ve apni takreer main islamic state ko aatanki sanghathan bataaen
 Before or after the namaz, say that a terrorist organization called Islamic State is un-islamic
 maa baap se kahen ki bacchon ko bataaen ki aise sanghathanon kii taraf aakarshith na hon
 Whether such activism is in America, Europe, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, but Islamic organizations of India have taken commendable initiative
 isse ek massej to jayega par kya kattarpanth ke raste par koi sirf dharmik kaarnon se hi chal padataa he, dharmik kaaran to hote hi hai lekin kya kuch or kaaran nahin hote honge
 a young man who goes to Syria with passport visa from Belgium, Britain, France, gets recruited in Islamic State's terrorist army, does he not know that Islam has nothing to do with terror
 kya wo islam ko lekar itnaa naasamajh he
 But on the other hand it is so sensible that he leaves his house and goes to become a terrorist
 aapane is sandarbh kii tamaam bahason main wahabi islam kaa zikr suna hoga
 For this, you have to understand the meaning of words like political Islam
 matlab dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneetik satta kaa nirmaan jo sharia se chalegaa samvidhan se nahin
 Fat fat can call it political Islam
 tippaniyan Just understand Wahab Islam, that the effect of local culture and society should be abolished and be treated according to the holy book
 saudi arab ko wahabi islam kaa prachaarak bataaya jaataa he lekin islam kii pavitra dhara ke bhi kai rup hai
 Like in India you cannot call tablig and wahab one
 usee tarah se aap bharat main wahabi islam or saudi wahaab ko ek kah sakate hai yaa nahin is baat ko lekar khaasi satarkta baratani hogi
 Does the Wahhabi Muslim of India also fight for political power like the Wahhabi or Salafi Muslims associated with Saudi or Islamic State
 yah sab sawaal zaruri hai
 Also, do all the terrorists involved in the Islamic State come from the Wahhabi stream itself
 aap jaanate hai ki islam main tarah tarah ke phirake hai
 Are cult
 har panth kii ek duusare se ladaai bhi he
 Protests have been announced in mosques against terrorism
 lekin islamic state ko noujvaan online se mil rahe hai
 Is there anything else online that is affecting the youth? yah bhi ek sawaal hona chahie
 So Muslim institutions are on the defensive by declaring appeals and arguments in mosques or they are helping America, Russia and France, prime time in fighting terrorism
 yah sunate hi bharat ke muslim sanghathan turant sakriy ho gaye jaise obama ji ke aagrah kaa intazaar ho rahaa tha
 Jamiat Ulema Hind has demonstrated against terrorism in many cities of India today
 kaha he ki islam kaa ISIS se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Jamiat has proclaimed jihad against terrorism and appealed to Muslim countries to join it
 moulana mahmud madani ne kaha ki kuch log brain vaash karne kii koshish kar rahe hai lekin ham log kattar takaton ke khilaaf ladenge
 You know that in 2013, Jamiat organized a fatwa by gathering against terrorism at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 usase pehle 2008 main daarul ulum devband ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf fatwa jari kiya tha
 Some time ago an organization named Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith also held a public meeting at Ramlila Maidan in which fatwas were read against terrorism
 is sabha main gaiyr muslim dharm guru bhi shaamil hue the
 In 2015, Ahle Hadith issued a fatwa against Dais ie Islamic State
 2006 main aatankwaad ke khilaaf jari fatve ko ek kitaab kii shakl main chapa gaya he
 In Mumbai, Mufti Mohammad Manjar Hasan Ashrafi said that he had issued a fatwa from the US in the month of September that Islam is against terrorism
 is fatve par 1070 mufti or imam ne dastakhat kiye hai
 The Raza Academy in Mumbai has announced that it will appeal to all mosques and clerics to call IS a terrorist organization
 ek maheenaa pehle bengaluru ke jama masjid ne karnataka kii 6000 masjidon ke imam ko khat likhaa he ki ve apni takreer main islamic state ko aatanki sanghathan bataaen
 Before or after the namaz, say that a terrorist organization called Islamic State is un-islamic
 maa baap se kahen ki bacchon ko bataaen ki aise sanghathanon kii taraf aakarshith na hon
 Whether such activism is in America, Europe, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, but Islamic organizations of India have taken commendable initiative
 isse ek massej to jayega par kya kattarpanth ke raste par koi sirf dharmik kaarnon se hi chal padataa he, dharmik kaaran to hote hi hai lekin kya kuch or kaaran nahin hote honge
 a young man who goes to Syria with passport visa from Belgium, Britain, France, gets recruited in Islamic State's terrorist army, does he not know that Islam has nothing to do with terror
 kya wo islam ko lekar itnaa naasamajh he
 But on the other hand it is so sensible that he leaves his house and goes to become a terrorist
 aapane is sandarbh kii tamaam bahason main wahabi islam kaa zikr suna hoga
 For this, you have to understand the meaning of words like political Islam
 matlab dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneetik satta kaa nirmaan jo sharia se chalegaa samvidhan se nahin
 Fat fat can call it political Islam
 tippaniyan Just understand Wahab Islam, that the effect of local culture and society should be abolished and be treated according to the holy book
 saudi arab ko wahabi islam kaa prachaarak bataaya jaataa he lekin islam kii pavitra dhara ke bhi kai rup hai
 Like in India you cannot call tablig and wahab one
 usee tarah se aap bharat main wahabi islam or saudi wahaab ko ek kah sakate hai yaa nahin is baat ko lekar khaasi satarkta baratani hogi
 Does the Wahhabi Muslim of India also fight for political power like the Wahhabi or Salafi Muslims associated with Saudi or Islamic State
 yah sab sawaal zaruri hai
 Also, do all the terrorists involved in the Islamic State come from the Wahhabi stream itself
 aap jaanate hai ki islam main tarah tarah ke phirake hai
 Are cult
 har panth kii ek duusare se ladaai bhi he
 Protests have been announced in mosques against terrorism
 lekin islamic state ko noujvaan online se mil rahe hai
 Is there anything else online that is affecting the youth? yah bhi ek sawaal hona chahie
 So Muslim institutions are on the defensive by declaring appeals and arguments in mosques or they are helping America, Russia and France, prime time in fighting terrorism

 aisi sakriyata america, europe, pakistan, bangladesh indonesia main he yaa nahin lekin bharat ke islamic sanghathanon ne saraahneey pahal to kii he
 This will send a message, but does anyone walk on the path of fundamentalism for religious reasons only, there are religious reasons but there will be no other reasons
 jo noujvaan belgium, britain, france se passport visa lekar syria chalaa jaataa he, islamic state kii aatanki sena main bhartee ho jaataa he kya use nahin maaloom ki islam kaa aatank se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Is he so dumb about Islam? lekin duusari taraf is kadar samajhadaar he ki apana ghar baar chhod aatankwaadi banane chalaa jaataa he
 You have heard the mention of Wahhabi Islam in all the debates in this context
 iske liye aapako polytical islam jaise shabdon ke maane samajhane honge
 That means the creation of political power on the basis of religion, which will run from Sharia and not the Constitution
 motaa moti ise polytical islam kah sakate hai
 The comments wahaab islam ko aap yun samajhiye ki sthaneey samskruti or samaaj ke asar ko samaapt kar pavitra kitaab ke anuroop hi aacharan kiya jaae
 Saudi Arabia is said to be a preacher of Wahhabi Islam, but there are many variations of the holy stream of Islam
 jaise bharat main aap tabalig or wahaab ko ek nahin kah sakate
 In the same way, you have to be very careful about whether you can call Wahhabi Islam and Saudi Wahab in India
 kya bharat kaa wahabi musalmaan bhi saudi yaa islamic state se jude wahabi yaa salphi musalamaanon kii tarah raajnneetik satta ke liye ladata he
 All these questions are important
 yah bhi ki islamic state main shaamil kya saare aatankwaadi wahabi dhara se hi aate hai
 You know that there are different types of spin in Islam
 panth hai
 Every sect also has a fight with each other
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf masjidon main takreer kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 But the Islamic State is getting youth from online
 kya online par kuch or he jiske prabhaav main noujvaan prabhavit ho rahe hai
 This should also be a question

 desh ke chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf congress samet duusare vipakshi dal mahabhiyog laane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Its process has also been started
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or anand sharma is sambandh main vipakshi dalon se baatcheet bhi kar rahe hai
 But if this happens, will the impeachment prove to be effective, that is the big question
 darasal, supreme court ke chif justise ko pad se hataane ke liye mahabhiyog laana hi ekmaatr vikalp hota he or sadan ke donon sadanon se do tihaai bahumat se prastaav ko manjuuri milane ke baad raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke baad hi unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This is the whole process - the signature of 100 mps in Lok Sabha and 50 members in Rajya Sabha is required to move impeachment motion against CJI
 hastakshar hone ke baad prastaav sansad ke kisi ek sadan main pesh kiya jaataa he
 The motion has to be submitted to either the Rajya Sabha chairman or the Lok Sabha speaker
 -rajyasabha chairman yaa loksabhaa spikar par nirbhar karata he ki vah prastaav ko radd kare yaa sweekaar kare
 If the Rajya Sabha chairman or Lok Sabha speaker approves the proposal, a three-member committee is formed to investigate the allegations
 is cameti main ek supreme court kaa nyaayadhish, ek ucch nyaayalay kaa mukhya nyaayadhish or ek nyayavid shaamil hota he
 -if the committee finds the judge guilty, then this report is presented in the House in which the motion has been made
 yah report duusare sadan ko bhi bheji jaati he
 The Inquiry report is sent to the President after it is backed by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament
 -raashtrapati apane adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue chif justise ko hataane kaa aadesh de sakate hai
 What is the current situation in Parliament, Congress is preparing to bring impeachment notice in Rajya Sabha
 ensipi saansad maajid memon ne isaki pushti karte hue bataaya he ki congress ne pradhan nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii karrwai kii prakriya shuru kar di he
 At the same time, MP DP Tripathi has told that he has signed and other mps are also participating in it
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki congress ko is prastaav par ensipi, tiemasi, sapa, diemke, left or iuemail kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 Talking about the strength of the anti-bjp parties in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress has 51, DMK 4, IUML 1, RJD 5, NCP 4, SP 13, TMC 13, BSP 4 and Left 6
 Are members
 is lihaaj se congress rajyasabha main mahabhiyog prastaav laane main kamyaabi hasil kar legi
 At the same time, if the proposal is also brought in the Lok Sabha, the opposition will be able to do so
 lekin ise paarit karaane kii sthiti main vipaksh nahin he
 In such a situation, there is no possibility of impeachment motion being passed
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki congress supreme court ke chaar jajon dwaara uthaae gaye masalon ko aadhaar banaakar mahabhiyog laane kii taiyaari he
 In which he is getting support from other opposition parties including TMC, NCP
 haalanki, yah notice kab diya jayega, is par abhi aadhikarik taur par koi jaankaree nahin he
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said that in the ongoing discussions about forming a similar alliance in Uttar Pradesh after the grand victory of the Grand Alliance in Bihar Assembly elections, the state ruled out the possibility of formation of such a Grand Alliance in the 2017 assembly elections

 However, Akhilesh did not clarify what other parties could join the SP in that grand alliance

 He had said that if these two parties meet then bjp's defeat is certain
 mukhyamantri ne jonpur main kaha kisampradayik shaktiyonse agar kisi dal ne sarthak muqabla kiya he to vah sapa hi he
 He said that Netaji will decide on the alliance

 Kumbh Mela, the world's largest fair is being held in Prayagraj
 makar sankranti ke saath kumbh meley kii shuruyaat ho jaaegi
 According to Hinduism, it is believed that bathing in any river in Kumbh provides freedom from all sins
 yahi vajah he ki kumbh main desh-videsh se log pavitra nadi main dubkee lagane pahunchate hai
 This time 12 crore people are expected to come to Kumbh
 tirth raaj prayag kii dev bhoomi par ganga, yamuna or saraswati kaa sangam hota he isliye is sthaan kaa mahatv or mahima sarvopari he
 Pilgrimage Prayag is also mentioned in the scriptures
 kehete hai ki yahi wo sthaan he, jahaan se prabhu ram ko kevat ne ganga paar karaayaa tha

 There is also a legend associated with this
 is parv kaa sambandh samudr manthan ke dauraan ant main nikle amrit kalash se judaa he
 When the deity-asura was snatching the nectar kalash from each other, a few drops of it fell in the three rivers of the earth
 jin teen nadiyon main amrit bunde giri thi ve hai ganga, godavari or kshipraa
 Kumbh is held at the place where these drops fell
 prayag main is baar ardh kumbh kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Now the question is also what is the difference between Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh
 ardhakumbh kya he?haridwar or prayag main do kumbh parvon ke bich 6 varsh ke antaraal main ardhakumbh kaa aayojan hota he
 Mythological texts also have astrological analysis regarding the holding of Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh

 It took Jayant 12 days to take the Amrit Kalash to Swargalok
 devon kaa ek din manushyon ke 1 varsh ke baraabar he

 php?file_name=careers About 25 years ago, a Kolkata newspaper published a one-page interview with me
 mujhase sawaal poocha gaya tha, “mi
 Advani, what is your weakness? " i immediately replied, "books" and then i said, "chocolate if i say it openly
" ” tab se lekar ab tak kisi khaas maukey par jo log mujhase milane aate hai unamem se kai yaa to kitaaben bhent karte hai yaa phir chocolate
 The best book i have received in recent times is The New Digital Age
 ise google ke agjicutive chairman erik shmit or google idiaj ke diarector jared kohen ne likhaa he
 These authors started the book as: “among the things that humans have created, the Internet is one of the few things that they do not fully understand
 ”bharat ko aaazaad hue 60 saal se zyada ho gaye hai
 We have not yet been able to overcome poverty or illiteracy and many other structural deficiencies
 ham karodon logon ke swasthya ko lekar bhi kuch thos nahin kar sake hai
 Despite this, the world respects our country as a healthy and active democracy
 ham aisa isliye kar sake kyonki hamane abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par hue daman ke saath samjhauta nahin kiya he, sivaay unke jinhen ‘taarkik’ kaha ja saktaa he
 Political activists like me cannot forget what happened during 1975-77 in the name of internal security
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 352 ke tahat desh main imargency laga di gai thi
 Fundamental rights were suspended and more than one lakh politicians and journalists were taken into custody without trial, posing a threat to internal security
 isliye jab mujhe bataaya gaya ki is vishesh lekh kaa vishay haih bharat main soshal media ko rajnatik niyantran se aazaadee kii jarurat kyon he? to main jhat taiyaar ho gaya
 The lesson of the Emergency's experience is that the answer to this question should be positive
 main bataanaa chaahunga ki internet ke aane se ekadam nae halaat bane hai
 Terrorism is a new challenge as far as the safety of citizens and the country is concerned
 da new digital aij main aatankwaad par ek puraa adhyay he
 It reads: "as we have made clear that technology brings everyone on par and gives powerful tools in the hands of people to fulfill their objectives, which are sometimes miraculously creative but sometimes imaginative Going beyond can also be disastrous
 ”yah kitaab vishesh taur par 2008 main mumbai main hue hamale kaa hawala detii haih “technology ne is hamale ko kahin zyada vinaashak bana diya tha, lekin jab aakhri hamalavar pakad liya gaya (iklauta jinda) to uske or uske saathiyon ke chode saamaan se mili soochna ke aadhaar par pakistani thikaanon or logon tak electronic madhyamon kii madad se pahunchaa ja sakaa, jo pehle shaayad sambhav nahin ho paata

 Senior BJP leader L
 ke
 lkadvani of Advani
 in naam se blog he Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly Paresh Dhanani has defended Congress leader Rajiv Satav
 darasal, saatav ne narmada sardaar sarovar virdohi or medha patkar ke samarthan main kiye gaye apane twit ko delit kar diya tha
 After this, the opposition party BJP attacked him fiercely
 is mudde par paresh dhanani ne apane party ke netaa saatav ke bachaav main kaha ki bijepi kii niti chori par siinaajori jaisi he
 He also thanked Medha Patkar, saying that he helped the people displaced due to the Sarodar Sarovar Dam in Madhya Pradesh and fought for their justice
 darasal, medha patkar ne madhya pradesh main narmada par sardaar sarovar baandh ki unchai ko badhaane ke faisle kaa virodh kiya tha
 Their protest lasted for a long time
 gauratlab he ki gujarat ke liye narmada sardaar sarovar baandh ko jivan kii door ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 Today, 75 percent of Gujarat gets water for drinking due to Sardar Sarovar Dam on Narmada River
 madhya gujarat se lekar saurashtra or kuccha tak narmada kaa pani jaataa he
 In such a situation, the sentiments of the people of Gujarat are associated with this project of Narmada
 bataa den ki rajeev saatav ko haal hi mengujarat congresske prabharee ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya he
 After which he deleted the tweet made against Narmada in support of Medha Patkar within three days

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet is expanding today
 mishan 2019 se pehlemodi cabinetka ye aakhri bada vistaar mana ja rahaa he or is vistaar main pradhanmantri ne rajanetaaon se zyada purv naukarshahon par bharosa dikhaaya he kyonki 9 nae chehron main se 4 purv naukarshah hai
 It is believed that by relying on the bureaucrats, Modi has hit two targets with one stone
 modi aaj jin chehron ko apni cabinet main shaamil kar rahe hai unamem purv grihasachiv aar ke singh, mumbai ke purv police kamishnar satyapal singh,didie ke purv kamisionar1979 batch ke iees officer alphons kannathan or research and information system for develping countries ke president hardip singh puri shaamil hai
 Of these, RK Singh is also the Lok Sabha MP of BJP from Baghpat in Tosatpal Singh UP from Ara in Bihar
 jabaki alphons or hardip kaa sidhe sidhe raajnneeti se koi vaasta nahin he
 Alphons was a 1979 batch IAS officer of Kerala cadre
 didie ke kamisionar ke rup main unhen demolision main kahkar pukaara jaataa tha jabaki hardip puri 1974 batch ke iesces afasar rahe hai
 The way Modi has played bets on officers, his two objectives are being fulfilled
 ek to unkemantrimandalmen prashasnic rup se daksh logon kii kami puri hogi or kyonki in chehron kaa lanbaa prashasnic anubhav rahaa he or apni-apni field main ye zyada nipunata rakhte hai, duusari ore rajanetaaon ke mukaable afasaron ko mantri banane kaa ek phayda ye bhi he ki afasar apane vibhaag ke naukarshahon se zyada behatar tareeke se conect ho pate hai or modi apane mantriyon se jis tarah ke parinaam kii ummid rakhte hai, vaise rigelt mantri or naukarshahon main talmail ke bina sambhav nahin hai

 BJP has decided to field Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for campaigning in Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections
 modi agle hafte apana prachaar abhiyaan shuru kar sakate hai
 Although there are many star campaigners like LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Hema Malini, but according to BJP sources almost every party candidate in UP wants Modi to campaign for it

 Particularly, the controversy over the inclusion of Babu Singh Kushwaha in the rural health mission scandal, has scared all the candidates that they may not have to bear the brunt of it in the elections, so the candidates hope that by jumping into Modi's campaign this loss Will be replenished tejasvi yadav ne niteesha kumaar par tanj kasate hue bole ki aadarneey nitish ji ne kaha ki wo mahatma gandhi ji ko maanate he
 Nitish ji, i have a sincere prayer to you, at least do not make Gandhiji a part of your ultra-narrow, narrow, U-turn and immoral politics
 aap to gandhi ji ke hatyaron se mil gaye phir kis munh se aap gandhi ji ke anuyaayi hone kaa jhootha daawa karte he
 How many times have i said from the stage in front of you that the BJP is the party of Gandhiji's killers, it is the party of those who believe in Godse
 nitish ji, prakhar samaajawaadee lohia ji kii yah shiksha nahin thi ki jis party kii niti, siddhant or ghoshnaa patr aapke sanjha kaarykram ke viruddh ho, gathbandhan sahyogiyon sang milakar unhen chunaav main karaari shikast di ho or bich main ghotaalon main fansi apni gardan bachaane ke liye aap unheen ke saath milakar sarkaar bana len
 You cannot hide your immoral decisions in the eyes of great men like Gandhi and Lohia

 If found guilty, it can take up to three years
 gangster shriprakash shukla ko aaj bhi upi kaa ab tak kaa sabase khoonkhaar criminal mana jaataa he
 The reason for this was that he was the first criminal who had an AK-47 rifle
 film star sanjay dutt ko jail kii sazaa kaatani padi, kyonki unke ghar se eke-56 rifl mili thi
 Having an AK-47 rifle is a serious crime in itself
 magar aajkal bihar kemungerke nadi, naale, kuen, jangal, zamin, dukaan or makaan sabhi ek-47 rifl ugal rahe hai
 Even Mikhail Klassnikov, who made weapons Zakhirake-47 in Munger, would not have imagined that his life-threatening search would be discovered by searching the river drains like this
 wo bhi bihar ke bihadon se
 So far, the Munger police has recovered around 20 ak-47s and 500 parts of this way
 sabase bada search oparation29 agast 2018
 This series of gunpowder and gunfire from Munger river drains started from this date
 pehali baar 3 eke-47 baraamad hui thim
 One person was arrested

 The police also arrested him

 Policemen are searching for gunpowder in the river drains
 Sweet water should be released from the wells
 munger main un kuon se jaanalevaeke-47nikal rahi hai
 Among the rivers in which fish should be searched are the Klassnikov rifles
 naalon main bhi gande pani se zyaada khatarnaak barood bharaa he
 However, there is no doubt that Munger is a Naxalite affected area of bihar
 mulk kii azaadi ke baad se police ne yahaan katte or desi bam to kai baar pakade hai
 But this is the first time that the police are getting an AK-47 in this internal area of bihar
 darjanabhar se zyada log giraftaapub to puure munger main tamaam nadi naalon ke nazadik khufia kutton ko phiraaya ja rahaa he
 Weapon detection machines and its experts are searching the entire area
 ab 13 logon ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 20 ak-47s and around 500 parts have been recovered
 magar shaq he ki abhi in ilaakon main kai or eke-47 ho sakati hai
 It is astonishing to hear of the death being made in Munger, but the Munger which was considered to be an arms factory and mine of illegal materials
 ab vahaan duniya kii sabase hifai raifal baraamad ho rahi he
 That is AK-47
 kaha ja rahaa he ki munger ke hathiyaar vyapaariyon ne itani tarakkee kar lee he ki wo eke-47 bechney lage hai
 Or say that these arms traders are providing deadly weapons like AK-47 to the Naxalites
 or munger se ai tasviren is baat kii tasdik kar rahi hai
 Recovered AK-47 Magazine and Parts Actually, the quality of AK-47 is that its parts can be disassembled easily and then can be folded back to make AK-47
 kul milakar hathiyaaron ke saudagaron or naksaliyon ke bich jabardast nexs chal rahaa he
 This is revealed by the recovered AK-47 magazine and parts

 Who is the mastermind of this whole matter and where are these weapons coming from
 iskaa khulaasa abhi baaki he
 There is no power shortage in the capital Delhi and the power cuts are due to the power companies
 ye kahana he dilli ke urja mantri haaron usoof kaa
 It is clear that during the election year, the Delhi government is not ready to bear the wrath of the people on electricity
 isliye sidhe bijli companiyon par nishaanaa saadh rahi he
 According to Aaron Yusuf, Delhi currently has 6000 MW of power and the maximum demand is close to 5200 MW
 isliye dilli main kahin bijli nahin aa rahi he yaa bijli cat rahi he, to iskaa ye matlab katai nahin he kii dilli main bijli kii kami he
 The reason for that deduction may be the local fault
 or ye local folt bhi kam se kam ho, iske liye discom ko sakht nirdesh die ja chuke hai

 This was followed by a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the apex policy-making body of the Congress, on Tuesday
 jisamen congress ne tay kiya ki jammu-kashmir ke logon ke saath party khadi rahegi or bijepi ke 'vibhaajankaree agenda' ke khilaaf ladegi
 However, in the long meeting of Congress CWC on Article 370, the party appeared to be divided into two factions
 jyotiraditya sindhiya, arpyen singh se lekar jitin prasad or deependra hooda jaise congress party ke uttar bhartiya netaaon ne dhara 370 hataae jane ke samarthan main apane tark rakhe
 These leaders expressed their concern about the political crisis of the Congress
 iske baavjood 'gandhi parivaar' modi sarkaar ke dwaara hataae gaye 370 faisle ke khilaaf ekamat he
 In the CWC meeting, Congress leader and former MP Jitin Prasad said that the atmosphere of the country is with the BJP on this issue
 aise main ham iskaa virodh karke desh ke siyaasi maahaul ke khilaaf ja rahe hai
 Jitin Prasad, while targeting Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, said that the favor of some people is getting support in Kashmir
 is par congress ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri pi chidambaram ne kaha ki aap kerala or tamilnadu ke bare main aisa nahin kah sakate hai
 On this Jitin said that it is okay but i come from UP, there is this feeling
 purv kendriya mantri or uttar pradesh ke kushinagar sansadeey seat se loksabhaa sadsy rahe arpyen singh ne bhi dhara 370 ke hataane ke virodh karne ke khilaaf apana tark rakhaa
 RPN said that you can be technically correct on Kashmir, but what to take among the public and what should be the answer? He said that after the decision to remove Section 370, political aspects, not technical, came out, which we have to take with the public
 is tarah se arpyen kaa sidhaa maananaa he ki maujuuda siyaasi mizaaj ko dekhte hue hamen iskaa virodh karnaa raajnneetik taur par mahangaa pad saktaa he
 Devendra Hooda, a veteran Congress leader and MP from Rohtak in Haryana, supported the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir
 unhone twit kar kaha tha, 'meraa pehle se hi vichaar he ki 21veen sadi main anuchhed 370 kaa koi auchity nahin he or isko hataanaa chahie
 This is not only for the integrity of the country but also in the interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of our country
 ' seedblusi kii baithak main deependra huda ne safai di
 He said that this was what i said after Pulwama and then tweeted freshly, but also wrote the government's way is not right
 hooda kii tarah jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhi dhara 370 ko hataane or kashmir ko do dhadon main baantne ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Scindia had tweeted, "I support the steps taken on Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and their complete integration in the country of India
" sanvaidhanik prakriya kaa purna rup se paalan kiya jaataa to behatar hota
 Also, no questions arise
 lekin ye faisla rashtrahit main liya gaya he or main iskaa samarthan karata hum
 'scindia said at the CWC meeting on Tuesday that i tweeted what the public sentiment was saying
 haalanki sarkaar ke tareeke se asahmat hum
 However, Scindia's talk received no support from anyone including the Gandhi family
 rahul gandhi ne sabhi netaaon kii baat sunne ke baad apni baat rakhi
 He said that we are with the truth but public sentiment alone cannot be the scale
 rahul ke haa main haa milaate hue congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar ne dhara 370 par loktantr kaa majaak banaaya
 In this way, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi appeared unanimously against the removal of Article 370

 According to a senior company passenger, the move is in line with the company's decision not to serve non-vegetarian food in less than 90 minutes of flight
 sutron ne bataaya ki ise pichley hafte se lagu kar diya gaya he, shuruaati anumaanon se prathit hota he ki isse airline ko 8-10 karod rupee kii bachat hogi
 a senior airline official, on the condition of anonymity, said the move has been taken only on the demand of passengers, although business class passengers on domestic flights will have the option of choosing both vegetarian or non-vegetarian food
 vahiin udyog ke visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki yah kadam company ke liye ulta asar karegaa or bachat to kaaphi hogi vahiin yatriyon kii sankhya bhi ghat jaaegi

 At the same time, industry experts say that this step will have the opposite effect for the company and the savings will be considerable, while the number of passengers will also decrease

 Allah will not ask any ruler what he did for the people of one religion
 He will ask people like me how did we make his work better? Pakistan was not created so that one religion dominates the other

 Now after the strong storm on Sunday, the meteorological department itself has accepted this fact
 mausam vibhaag ke didism doctor dharmendra pradhan ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki mausam vibhaag ne pehle 50 se 60 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar kaa anumaan lagaaya tha lekin dilli-ensiaar main aandhi ke dauraan hawaaon kii adhiktam raftaar 109 kilometre prati ghanta record kii gai

 The Meteorological Department has also issued an alert for rain and thunderstorm in more than 20 districts of Uttar Pradesh till Tuesday morning

 At a time when the biggest campaign of the central government is about cleanliness, how can it be that while cleaning sewage across the country, there is no movement on the death of the sweepers coming from all over the country

 The death of four people in Delhi's Githorni was given prominence by the media, but during the internet search, it seemed that such news as a routine somewhere in a corner and die forever
 aam log rozmarra kii zindagi main hi itnaa uljhe hai ki unhen dosha nahin diya ja saktaa he ki koi fark nahin padataa

 Therefore, if there is a confirmed job, then a family member will have to be replaced
 research ke dauraan ye baat saamne ai ki kisi bhi nagarpalika main siver yaa gater saaf karte vakt dam ghutane se hone vaali maut kaa sahi-sahi aankada nahin rakhaa jaataa he

 magar kai report main is baat kaa zikr mila ki marane vaale safaikarmiyon ke parijanon ko muawza nahin miltaa he
 On July 12, 2011, the Supreme Court passed a landmark order outlining the plight of manual scavengers and sewage workers
 court ne unke kalyaan or suraksha ko lekar sarkaar kii samvedanheenata kii bhi kadi aalochana kii
 Not only did the Supreme Court order more compensation to the families of those killed, as well as directing the urban bodies to immediately follow the Delhi High Court's order that ensures the safety of those working in sewage

 Apart from this, compensation was given to the sewage laborers suffering from their work related diseases, to their dependents after their death, to provide PF and other facilities

 magar, iskaa bada hissaa he shaharon kii safai or sivej kaa treetment
 Most of the hygiene advertisements have been made regarding toilets

 However, the safety of the scavengers and the equipment required for them is nowhere to be seen
 mumbai kii nagarpalika kaa bajet to kai hazaar karod he vahaan bhi manhole saaf karte hue safaikarmchaaree mar jate hai
 This means that they do not have enough modern machines and the design of our cities is such that these giant trucks cannot reach everywhere

 uri main hue aatanki hamale ke mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nishane par lete hue shivasena ne kaha ki aaj sthiti congress ke shashan ke dauraan rahi sthiti se bhi kharaab ho chuki he
 The Shiv Sena said that if the Prime Minister is unable to attack Pakistan and eliminate terrorists, his efforts to create a global image will prove futile
 shivasena ne jammu-kashmir main aatankiyon or pakistan-samarthak tatwon se sakhti se nipatane ke liye rajya kii sarkaar ko bhang karne or rajya main marshall lau lagane kaa bhi aahvaan kiya
 Taking an aggressive stand, the Shiv Sena said that Pakistan has waged an open war against India with this attack and our efforts to gather evidence of Pakistan's involvement have not yielded any international results
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main ek sampadakeey main kaha, 'aapako sweekaar karnaa hoga ki aaj kii sthiti congress ke shashan ke dauraan rahi sthiti se kharaab he
 At a time when slogans are being raised in support of Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir and hoisting Pakistani flags there, the Center should dissolve the state government and impose 'martial law' there, because the President (governor) Governance will not be enough
 ' Shiv Sena said, "pakistan has now waged an open war against India, while we cannot do anything except give warnings
 pathankot main kiye gaye aatanki hamale kii jaanch kaa nateeja bhi pakistan ke khilaaf kisi karrwai ke rup main saamne nahin aayaa
 ' shivasena ne kaha, 'ham is aatanki hamale main pakistan kii sanliptata kaa saboot kyon dhundh rahe hai? is saboot kaa antarrashtriya str par koi mahatv nahin he
 If you (in PM Modi) do not have the courage to attack that kind of attack on Pakistan as the US had said for the elimination of Osama bin Laden, then it is no use to build an international image
 ' The editorial said that external countries will not help India on this issue
 agar pakistan tabaahi machaane ke liye chaar aatankiyon kaa istemaal kar saktaa he to bharat pakistan par hamalaa bolne ke liye apane suraksha balon kaa istemaal kyon nahin kar saktaa? The Shiv Sena said that the issue would not be resolved by placing a wreath on the coffins of the martyred soldiers or accepting the condolences of foreign countries
 iske bajaay is samay jarurat hamaare suraksha balon ko bal die jane kii he
 The Shiv Sena said, "terrorist attacks have become common in Jammu and Kashmir
 yah kiski vifaltaa he? modi chetavaniyaan dena jari rakh sakate hai lekin sawaal yah he ki pakistan ko iskaa parinaam kab or kitna bhugatna hoga?'tippaniyan Significantly, heavily armed militants attacked an army base in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday
 is hamale main 17 jawan shahid ho gaye
 It is suspected that the terrorists were associated with the jaish-e-muhammad, a Pakistan organization
 jammu-kashmir main sena par kiye gaye is ghaatak hamale par bharat ne kadi pratikriya di he or pradhanmantri ne bhi is hamale kii kadi ninda kii he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The Shiv Sena also called for dissolving the state government and imposing martial law in the state to deal with terrorists and pro-pakistan elements strictly in Jammu and Kashmir

 The Supreme Court's decision on 30 is to come
 ayodhya main yah vivaad sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha
 Now this dispute is about to end
 vaise to hoicourt ko darjanon vaad binduon par faisla dena he lekin yahaan ek mahatvapurn mudda ye bhi he ki yah duniya kaa ek anokhaa cese he jisamen court ke saamne fariyadi khud bhagwaan hai
 It was because of this that the Babri Masjid Sangharsh Samiti was set up to tell you that in 1986, on the appeal of a local lawyer and journalist Umesh Chandra Pandey, then Faizabad District Judge Krishnamohan Pandey passed the order to lock the disputed premises on 1 February 1986
 is aadesh kaa bahut virodh hua muslim pairokaron ne ise ekatarfa faisla bataaya tha
 In response to this, the Babri Masjid Sangharsh Samiti was formed in February 1986 and the Muslim community too adopted the path of movement and struggle like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 1 july 1989 main kaha gaya ram is sampatti ke maalik1989 ke aam chunaav se pehle vishwa hindu parishad ke ek netaa or ritred jaj devaki nandan agarwal ne 1 july ko bhagwaan ram ke mitra ke rup main paanchvaan daawa faijabad kii adaalat main daayar kiya
 It was accepted in the claim that on 23 December 1949 the idols of Ram Chabootare were kept inside the mosque
 daawa kiya gaya ki janm sthaan or bhagwaan ram donon poojya hai or vahi is sampatti ke maalik bhi hai
 Babur was mentioned to tell you that in this case it was mainly mentioned that Babur broke an old Ram temple and built a mosque there

 Aditya Thackeray has opposed the cutting of forests, as well as has expressed to the Central Government and the State Government that they are not unanimous on the issue of environment
 There’s no point for the Central government ministry of climate change to exist, or to speak about plastic pollution when the@mumbaimetro3senselessly destroys the Aarey vicinity
 This ego battle taken up by Metro 3 is destroying the purpose of making it

 Talking about plastic pollution with the construction of Mumbai metro is insensitivity

 Has the power struggle started in the family of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav? Is Lalu's son Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav face to face to capture the party? These questions are arising because Tej Pratap on Saturday showed rebellious remarks against the party and alleged that now he is not being heard in the party
 darasal, shanivaar ko tej pratap kaa ek video viral hua, jisamen wo is baat ko lekar naaraaz dikh rahe hai ki party main unki koi nahin sun rahaa he
 In this viral video, Tej Pratap Yadav is talking about RJD leader Rajendra Paswan, who comes from Dalit society
 wo rajendra ram ko party main sammanjanak pad dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 They are also complaining that this demand is being ignored by the party
 is viral video main tej pratap yadav argedy ke andar kuch asaamaajik tatwon kii entry kii baat kah rahe hai, jo party ko na keval kamjor kar rahe hai, balki unhen tejasvi ke saath ladvane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Tej Pratap is complaining in this video that if he calls any leader, no one gives a response
 tej pratap video main party ke andar anushaasanheenata kii bhi baat kehete hai
 Former Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap also says that the reports of his confrontation with his brother are completely wrong
 wo tejasvi ko apane jigar kaa tukdaa bataa rahe hai
 Tej Pratap is saying that the anti-social element inside the party is trying to break the RJD and weaken Lalu Prasad Yadav
 tejpratap is video main maang kar rahe hai ki party ke andar jo asaamaajik tatv ghus gaye hai, unhen alaakaman turant baahar nikaalen
 According to Tej Pratap, when he told his wife about his neglect in the party to Aishwarya, she was shocked to hear this
 sutron kii maane to argedy ke agle pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar tej pratap or tejasvi yadav main than gai he
 While Tej Pratap wants Rajendra Paswan to be the next state president of the party, Tejashwi Yadav is in favor of making former minister Shivchandra Ram as state president
 donon bhaaiyon ke bich sab kuch thik nahin he
 This was known only on Saturday morning, when Tej Pratap Yadav made a tweet
 isamen unhone khud ko krishna or tejasvi ko arjuna bataaya tha
 In this tweet, Tej Pratap said, 'I think that i should sit on the throne of Hastinapur and go to Dwarka myself
 ab kuchhek chugalkhoron ko ksht he ki kahin main king mekar na kahalaauun
 After this viral video of Tejapratap surfaced and the controversy started, Tejashwi again tweeted, in which he said, 'in front of RJD and coalition partners, there is a big responsibility to form a new government for the year 2019, but we are not against those anti-social elements Be careful who want to break into this unity

 An alliance has been formed between the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of Abhay Chautala to contest the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ab donon dal saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav or upi va haryana main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko ek saath milakar ladenge
 The objective of this alliance is to form a third front against BJP and Congress
 yah teesraa morcha basapa supremeo mayawati ke netritv main banegaa
 However, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and BSP differ on this issue
 isse pehlespa pramukh akhilesh yadavakah chuke hai ki saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye congress samet sabhi dalon ko ek manch par laana hoga yani tisare morche main congress bhi shaamil hogi
 Whereas after this alliance between Mayawati and Abhay Chautala's party, it was said that this third front is against BJP and Congress
 donon dalon ne desh ko lutaa he or ab inako satta se baahar kiya jayega
 This third front will work to bring farmers and Dalits on one platform
 bijepi ke aane ke baad se haryana ab tak teen baar jal chukaa he
 With the joining of the INLD and the BSP, one thing has become clear that the two parties will fight together for the upcoming assembly elections in Haryana, but at present the picture is not clear about the electoral alliance to be held in 2019
 isaki vajah yah he ki upi main chunavi gathbandhan karne vaali basapa or sapa ke bich tisare morche main congress ko shaamil karne ko lekar matbhed he
 The SP is in favor of taking the Congress along in this electoral front, while the BSP and the INLD are talking about keeping the Congress out of this front
 in donon dalon kaa kahana he ki teesraa morcha sirf bijepi hi nahin, balki congress ke bhi khilaaf hoga
 Both Congress and BJP have looted the country
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ladane ko lekar basapa or sapa ke bich matbhed mushkil paidaa kar sakate hai
 It may be known that before the BSP, the SP has contested the UP assembly elections with the Congress
 haalanki haalia up chunaav basapa or sapa ne milakar ladaa tha, jisamen bijepi ke khilaaf jeet bhi mili thi
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has remembered Ram Lala as soon as the elections in Uttar Pradesh come to a head
 bijepi 'vikaas' ke saath 'ram' naam ko jodakar chunavi baitarani paar karne ke jugad main he
 Not only BJP, Congress is also preparing to chant 'ram' before the elections
 yahi vajah he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi 6 sitambar se upi main chunavi shankhanaad ke liye mahayatra par niklenge to ek raat ayodhya main bhi deraa daalenge
 The tune and development of Ram as well as the UP election is the biggest challenge for bjp's 'shah' Amit Shah
 bihar chunaav main party kii jo gat bani use amit shah kisi bhi keemat main upi main doharaate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 For this, he has prepared the mantra of development with the name of 'ram'
 modi sarkarupi menram-van-gaman-maarg or ram-janaki-maarg se do nae maarg viksit karne ja rahi he
 They have been named the Ramayana Circuit
 ram van gaman margyah rasta ayodhya ko chitrakoot se jodega
 The 262 km long route will cover Faizabad, Sultanpur, Pratapgarh, Jethavara, Shrangverpur, Manjhanpur, Rajapur
 ram janaki margyah maarg ram kii nagari ayodhya ko nepal main sita ke maayke janakapur se jodega
 Uttar Pradesh will have 218 km of this route
 is maarg par upi main chhavnee, kalwari, barhalganj, barhaaj or bihar main sivaan, chakiya, madhubani or sitamarhi aaenge
 Ayodhya is an important step in Rahul's march? If the BJP is confident of the Ramayana circuit, then the Congress is also looking to regain the lost land in UP by turning the garland of 'ram'
 yahi vajah he ki 6 sitambar se shuru ho rahicongress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhiki mahayatra ko ayodhya le jane kii bhi taiyaari ho rahi he
 a section of the Congress believes that if Rahul visits Ram Lalla, a good message will be sent to the voters
 yatra ko lekar congress nahin khol rahi pattesutron ke mutabik, rahul kii mahayatra kaa sabase ahm padaav ayodhya main ek raat kaa vishram rahegaa
 However, the Congress is not opening full cards about this
 upi main congress ke prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad se jab ayodhya main rahul ke kaarykram ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone sirf itnaa kaha, 'agar mahayatra ke raste main ye aayega to ve vahaan jarur jaaenge
 But nothing has been decided yet
 'bataa den ki rahul kii mahayatra 6 sitambar ko devaria ke rudrapur se shuru hokar upi ke 39 jilon se gujaregi
 The 2500 km journey will cover 55 Lok Sabha constituencies and 223 assembly constituencies of UP
 pike ne taiyaar kiya rahul kii yatra kaa guna-ganitarahul kii mahayatra kaa root upi ke liye congress ke master ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne taiyaar kiya he
 The Congress is engaged in brainstorming all aspects related to Rahul's Ayodhya halt
 baharhaal, rahul kii mahayatra ko kaamyaab banane ke liye koi kasar nahin chhod rahi he
 This is the reason why RPN Singh, Rajiv Shukla and Mim Afzal have been appointed media incharge for better media management of the yatra
 baharhaal, ram ke raste par chalakar jahaan bijepi lakhanu main satta ke dwaar tak pahunchnaa chaahati he, vahiin congress bhi jataana chaahati he ki ram dhun gane main wo bhi peeche nahin he

 unheen ke chauke se bharat ne jeet hasil kii

 yujavendra chahal kii aguwai main bhartiya gendbaajon ne dakshin africa ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya lekin main ant main kris mauris (42) or kaagiso rabada (naabad 31) ke bich aathven wicket ke liye 66 ranon kii saajhedaari ke dam par dakshin africa kisi tarah bharat ke saamne 228 kaa lakshya rakh paane main safal rahi
 In this match, Chahal and his partner Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav once again lured the batsmen for runs in the middle overs and took pressure wickets
 chahal ne chaar wicket apane naam kiye, kuldeep ko haalanki ek hi wicket mila
 Before the Chahal, South Africa had to suffer the wrath of Bumrah

 unhone kaha ki yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki kuch samay ke liye uttar pradesh ke kaaryvahak rajyapal niyukt kiye gaye kuraishi ne vahaan bhi kuch vishvavidhyalayon ko galat dhang se manjuuri de di or kulapatiyon sahit kuch anya niyuktiyaan bhi kar deen
 Baluni said that our demand is that the entire decisions taken during Qureshi's tenure should be examined objectively, so that the truth can be revealed to everyone
 bijepi netaa ne is sambandh main uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri par bhi tanj kasate hue kaha ki har samay pradesh ke hit kii badi-badi baaten karne vaale harish ravat bhi is masale par chuppi saadhe rahe or tatkaaleen rajyapal ko ‘galat kaam’ karne se nahin roka
 Input: IANS basapa vidhayakon ne bhi payalat ke khilaaf kholaa morchabaspa vidhayak gudha ne kaha ki hamaare netaa gahalot hamrajasthan congress main ghamaasan apane charam par he
 Amid opposition from the state Congress President and Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot over Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) mlas joining Congress here, the BSP mlas also made it clear that our leader is Ashok Gehlot
 vidhayakon ne kaha ki or kisi ko vah netaa nahin maanate hai
 MLA Rajendra Gudha, who won on the Bahujan Samaj Party ticket from Udaipurwati in Jhunjhunu district, has joined the Congress and says that we have joined the Congress party in the face of Ashok Gehlot
 kisi or ke chehre par ham congress main nahin aae hai
 CM will decide on the opposition of Sachin Pilot to include the mlas from the Padmavujan Samaj Party in the Council of Ministers, who said that it is the right of the Chief Minister to include and not to include in the cabinet
 kisi or ko is maamle main dakhal dena nahin chahie or dakhal dene kaa adhikaar bhi nahin hota he
 Gudha was asked when Congress state president Sachin Pilot is repeatedly saying that Bahujan Samaj Party mlas have given a great example of morality and joined the Congress party without any will
 is par gudha ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki naitikta to vah hoti he ki congress party kii haar ke baad congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahe rahul gandhi ne istipha de diya tha
 Pilot in favor of its leaders
 Actually, Sachin Pilot has made it clear that if the cabinet is expanded or there are political appointments, then the Congress leaders who were sweating the elections should get a place in it
 payalat kii naaraazgi is baat ko lekar bhi he ki vah rajasthan main congress ke pradesh adhyaksh hai or unhen media se pataa chalaa ki bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak congress ke vidhayak ban gaye hai
 Even none of these mlas have yet met State Congress President Sachin Pilot
 is bare main jab hamane gudha se poocha to unhone kaha ki hamane koi jaruri nahin samajha
 Anyway, one of our mlas, Wajib Ali, has gone to Australia, so we thought that he would come and meet him once
 ek baar jab ham congress main shaamil ho gaye hai to kabhi bhi jaakar mil sakate hai
 On the question of the Congress organization not knowing about the mlas' involvement, Ashok Gehlot was in our contact for a long time
 unki baatcheet congress kii rashtriya adhyaksh sonia gandhi se chal rahi thi, achaanak se raat ko unka aadesh aayaa to ham turant jaakar congress vidhanmandal main shaamil hone kaa aavedan de aae
 On the question of leaving Bahujan Samaj Party, Gudha said that even before we said that tickets are sold there, still on the day of Mayawati's birthday, we were told that all 200 will collect 7-7 lakh rupees from the assembly and send to Lucknow
 itnaa zyada bhrashtachar ham bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe the

 ' On the other hand, Secondary Education Minister DS Cheema says that speaking on drugs has become a fashion in Punjab
 hamaare skulon main 55 lakh bachche hai, in sabakaa test karwaanaa mumkin nahin or isaki zarurat bhi nahin he
 But teachers believe that any such attempt will curb the drug
 punjab teachers association ke sanyukt sachiv surajeet singh ke mutabik yah test zarur hona chahie
 He said that if the government cannot get everyone tested, then at least get a random test done, this will let the parents also know what necessary precautions should be taken in time
 ullekhneey he ki punjab main nashe kaa jaal teji se fail rahaa he
 In the border areas, 75 per cent of the 15 to 25-year-old youth are addicted, while according to government statistics, 67 per cent of the households in the villages have at least one drug addict
 pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi tak, desh ke sheersh netritv ne punjab main nashe kii samasya par chintaa jataai he, jabaki punjab kii badal sarkaar kah rahi he ki punjabiyon ko bevajaah badnaam kiya ja rahaa he, haalanki rajya sarkaar ke paas apane bachaav ke liye koi thos aankada nahin he

 Tell our readers something about the process of being your own writer? - i have not understood myself till date
 kabhi kabhi koi ek kahani kii tasviir man main hoti he, kabhi koi ek vaakya hi hota he jo puri kahani main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 Sometimes a small blurred part of a story is sitting in a dark corner of the mind, then suddenly it comes up under some unknown pressure by becoming a story
 barason baras adivaasiyon ke bich jangalon main rahaa
 Experiences of living in the forest later came to be useful of writing, that is, this journey was a journey of constantly watching, understanding and learning and writing
 to mujhe lagata he ki zyada behatar rahaa
 Around 19–20 years of age, he started writing stories and stories started appearing in big magazines
 shuruyaat main kam likhaa lekin yah jaldi hi mahasoos ho gaya ki lekhan ke bagaiyr ab chhutkaaraa nahin, likhnaa ek tarah kii ki vivashtaa ho gaya

 ek ejeeniyar ko uski vyavsaayik jimmedaariyaan zyada lubhaati hai yaa shabdon kii duniya?- ejeeniyar hona roti kii majaburi he
 Compulsion of employment
 varanaa main to ek skool main adhyaaapak hona chahta tha
 But while writing in the beginning, one day i came to know that i have started writing stories and i have my own world within the world of words
 shabdon kii duniya se baahar mere liye baahar kii duniya zyada kathin he
 To get out of this difficulty and complexity, or to retaliate, i like writing more
 bahut jaldi mujhe lagane laga tha ki ejeeniyar bahut saare ho sakate hai
 But there is only one writer
 ejeeniyar hone kii jimmedaari se zyada badi jimmedaari lekhak hone kii he
 While writing, there are big references to humanity
 ek aadmi kii takalif likhte hue tamaam manushyon kii takalif likhnaa kathin he lekin jaruri bhi
 This is the first responsibility of a storyteller

 Which of your works have you considered to be your best work? And why? - It is very difficult to name a single story
 ek lekhak ko apni har rachana se prem hota he
 Every story stands out as a challenge every time
 kisi ek kaa naam bataanaa duusare ke saath jyaadati he
 Every story has taken the same tough test as the first story
 
 
 isliye kisi ek kahani kaa naam bataanaa thodaa kathin lagata he
 The language, craft and content of each story is different, so one story cannot be put on an anorexia account on any one basis

 Your reaction to what is being written in Hindi literature today? - Today the situation is better and partly worse
 behatar isliye kii navlekhan main kahani ko lekar kahe to shilp ke str par bada kaam hua he, lekin bura yah hua ki ab sab kuch bazaar ke hawaale hota ja rahaa he
 The ideals of most young writers are not Premchand, Renu but Chetan Bhagat
 sasti lokapriyata zyada aakarshith karti he
 As values are being lost in society and life, it is also affecting creativity
 yah ek dukhad sthiti he
 Everything is handed over to the market
 lekin adhikansh lekhak khush hai or garv se kehete hai ki yah vikaas he varanaa kya abhi bhi baiylgaadee yug main rahaa jaae ? bazaar jo vikaas de rahaa he, uskaa mulya hamaari saamaajik or saanskrithik asmita ko centre main rakhkar chukaana pad rahaa he
 Nobody is concerned about language, society and culture, this is a sad situation
 darasal har kalkhand main sahitya ke saamne chunautiyaan bhinn-bhinn hoti hai
 Today, due to the work of former litterateurs, deep insights and relationships are not being formed
 prayek ke apane nijee aagrah vaishishty prakat hone lage hai
 The meaning of what is written is that later writers can get a creative challenge from it
 darasal lekhan saamaajikta main shaamil hokar khud kii talash kaa aadhyatmik or moulik tarika he
 Writing is a sensitive exploration and investigation of social concerns on the basis of personal and has its own level of expression

 How much and at what level do campuses affect the writer in the literary world? - The main reasons for the camp are the position, award, power and desire for proximity to power and other reasons
 jo lekhak puraskaar paanaa chahta he or use nahin mil paata, to is kheme bandi ko kosne lag jaataa he or jaraa sa avasar milte hi isi gandagi kaa hissaa ho jaataa he
 But the prize that is freed from attachment does not have any effect on camp
 vah apane ekant main nirantar likhata rahata he
 Khembandi has damaged many writers, many talents, but in today's market time it is a kind of accepted gang betting
 isi khemebaaji ke kaaran anek lekhak avsaad kaa shikaar hue kyonki khemon ne apane chaheton ko chaahe vah tisare darje kii pratibha ho, pramot kiya
 This ganging prioritized sycophancy and neglected talent
 bhuneshwar or muktibodh jaise lekhakon ko maraghat ke raste saahitiyik sweekruti or prasiddhi mili, yani marane ke baad
 Khemabaji also brought fame and fame to many talentless writers through the thieves door of Khemabaji

 Your novel 'jas Ka Phool' became very popular? How real and how fictional are its characters? Along with telling about this, also tell me what you are writing these days? - Jas Flower characters are characters raised from life
 bas maine itnaa bhar kiya he ki jivan yatharth ko katha yatharth main badal diya or yah paatr mere hi jivan main kyon har kisi ke jivan main har kisi ke aasapaas najar aa jaaenge
 It is very common and common people
 inaki vishistataa inaki saamanyata main chhipi he
 The important thing is that these characters seem closer to life and reality
 jivan se katha main or katha se jivan main inaki awajahi sahaj bani hui he
 This is also the ease of the novel
 jab log kehete hai ki is upanyaas ke paatr hamen apane aasapaas ke or sahaj lagate hai to mujhe lagata he ki likhnaa sarthak hua
 These days i am working on a novel about the life-struggle of the tribals

 You must have read and heard a lot about the earnings, characters, story, filming, scenes etc
 of Bahubali 2 so far
 film kamai ke nae record tod rahi he, ye bhi aapako pataa hoga
 But today we are telling you about an untouched aspect of the film
 ji haa, baat hogi devsena kii
 One of the main characters in this film is Devasena
 wo jitani khubasurat he, utani hi jaambanj bhi
 a girl who is perfect in every way
 feminist bhi or sanskari bhi
 Come, know those 5 things of Devasena that you should see on the big screen
 misaal: formula res car chalaane vaali pehali bhartiya mahila baniin gul panaag1
 Devasena is as beautiful as Jambanj too
 film main uski entry hi talwaar chalaate hoti he
 Devasena is the woman's form, which you can call ideal
 har ladki ko devsena kii bhaanti khud ko multi-telented hone par dhyaan dena chahie
 2
 devsena jab vivaah kaa prastaav thukaraati he to uski aatm nirbharta or atmasamman jhalkata he
 He does not like gold-plated platter but loves dignity
 ye kisi bhi ladki ko self rispect kii sikh detii he
 3
 devsena ko jisase pyaar he, uskaa khulkar izhaar he
 Even in Mahishmati's court, she openly says that she has the right to choose her husband
 iske liye wo kisi kii parvaah nahin karti
 Even the mother tells Sivagami about her rights to choose a Kshatriya girl
 isse awarenes kii sikh milti he
 Example: 16 year old Srishti Kaur became Miss Teen Universe 20174
 devsena ko apane pyaar par puraa yakeen he
 She plays Amarendra Baahubali in every situation
 chaahe uskaa vakt bura ho yaa acha, har samay main wo uske saath dikhti he
 For a girl, this is a learning of culture
 5
 She does not tolerate the poor behavior of the commander while going to the temple
 mahilaon ke shoshan ke khilaaf wo itani buland he ki kataari se senapati kii anguliyaan tak kaat detii he
 This shows that no matter what the time is, she will not tolerate exploitation at all

 Ashwini alleged that a minister and a Member of Parliament, a relative of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, are directly complicit in this, hence the state government cannot conduct a fair investigation in this matter, hence the matter should be investigated by the CBI

 How many complaints have been filed against Ramvriksha since 1 January 2014? How many firs were registered? How many chargesheets were filed? The answers to all these questions have to be given by the UP government to the High Court by the next date

 US President Barack Obama called him today after the resignation of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and said that he is one of the few leaders whom he appreciates and that he will miss the lack of working with him

 He expressed confidence that the Narendra Modi government will do everything possible to take it further

 There are few such leaders in public life, whom i greatly like and appreciate
 ' The US President told the former Prime Minister, "your tenure India and India
 america sambandhon ke liye acha rahaa
 i will continue to miss working with you on a daily basis
 ’’ At the same time, Manmohan Singh thanked the US President for showing appreciation, cooperation and friendship
 singh ne unase kaha, 'aapkaa netritv vaishvik chunautiyon ko hal karne main zyada sahyogparak dhaancha taiyaar karne main ahm kaarak rahaa
 ' bihar main siyasat kii hawa kaa rukh is ore saaf ishaara kar rahaa he ki jeethanram maanjhi kii jagah nitish kumaar phir se siem ho sakate hai
 There is a meeting between Jitan Ram Manjhi and JDU National President Sharad Yadav
 samajha ja rahaa he ki donon ke bich netritv parivartan ko lekar charchaa ho rahi he
 Manjishrad Yadav, who did not reach Nitish's convening meeting, is meeting Manjhi at the Chief Minister's residence
 buudhvaar ko bhi sharad or maanjhi ke bich mulaakaat hui thi
 Nothing has been said on this meeting from the party
 haalanki sharad yadav baar-baar kehete rahe hai ki jeethanram maanjhi ko siem pad se nahin hataaya jayega
 Party leaders have pointed out that Manjhi is trying to convince them to propose the name of Nitish Kumar himself
 mulaayam ne kiya nitish ko phone, CM pad par charchaaek taraf janata jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav kehete hai ki jeethanram maanjhi apane pad par bane rahenge
 On the other hand, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav has called and talked to Nitish Kumar three times
 mulaayam nitish par phir se mukhyamantri banane ke liye dabaav bana rahe hai
 RJD President Lalu Prasad has already said that he has nothing to do with who becomes the CM of JDU
 unhen nitish ke mukhyamantri banane par koi aitraaj nahin he
 Ramitha Ram, a Dalit minister in the Jitan Ram Manjhi government, says Manjhi will no longer be the Chief Minister of Bihar until February 15
 in sabake bich ek baat sabhi jaanate hai, chaahe ve mantri hon yaa vidhayak, jeethanram maanjhi kii badaulat bijepi or narendra modi kaa muqabla nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, Nitish will have to take the reins of power again
 nitish kab or kaise banenge siem?10 farvari ko dilli chunaav kaa parinaam aana he
 If AAP succeeds, it will be an opportune time for Nitish
 dilli kii haar se bijepi ko jhatka lagegaa
 Even if the result of Delhi is reversed, Nitish still has time from February 10 to February 20, as the budget session of Bihar Legislative Assembly is starting from February 20
 satr ke lanbaa chalane kii vajah se uske baad netritv parivartan kaa koi matlab bhi nahin rah jayega
 It will also have an impact on the morale of the party workers
 15 farvari kii dedline isliye tay kii gai he ki us din patna ke gandhi maidan main jediu apana kaaryakarta sammelan kar rahaa
 Nitish has called the conference
 jediu ke nitish samarthak chaahate hai ki ve us din bataur mukhyamantri usamen hissaa len, taaki iskaa acha prabhaav pade
 On the other hand it is also being said that the working style changed after Nitish's government came to Bihar, it went completely old during Jitan Ram Manjhi's government
 pradesh main tabadalon kaa daur chal padaa he
 Two ministers of Manjhi, Lalan Singh and PK Shahi have also questioned their own government regarding transfers
 jeethanram maanjhi khud kehete hai ki mantri or adhikari unki baat nahin sunate hai
 The law and order situation has deteriorated, so the party leadership feels that in these circumstances the BJP can benefit in the coming elections
 yahi vajah he ki nitish par phir se mukhyamantri banane kaa dabaav bad rahaa he
 However, the BJP never wants Jitan Ram Manjhi to step down from his post, because as long as he stays, the BJP will be in profit
 isliye bijepi ke netaa baar-baar unhen vidhansabha bhang karne kii salaah bhi de rahe hai, taaki chunaav tak ve keretekar siem ke taur par rahen
 Manjhi's supporters also want the same
 aise main jediu netritv kaaphi phoonk-foonkkar kadam rakh rahaa he, taaki saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi na toote
 The party believes that the situation should be such that Jitan Ram Manjhi himself proposes Nitish Kumar to take over as Chief Minister, so that no one will say that he has been removed from the post
 baharhaal, ab party ko isamen kitni safalataa milti he, yah dekhnaa abhi baaki he
 It seems that the matter will be completely cleared within the next few hours

 There was a stir after a bomb was reported in a building in Mumbai
 police kaa bam nirodhak dasta maukey par pahunchakar chaanbin main juta hua he
 The case is on Thursday evening
 mumbai ke mahalakshmi ilaake main star india kii building main bam hone kii soochna di gai, jiske baad vahaan afratfari fail gai
 The building has been evacuated
 police ko ab tak vahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa visphotak padaarth nahin mila he
 It is worth noting that sometimes some mischievous people give false information about the bomb to the police
 kai baar sandigdh yaa laavaaris chizon ko bhi bam samajhakar isaki soochna police ko de di jaati he
 Despite these things, it becomes extremely important for the administration to be vigilant
 pakistan nausena ne mangalvaar ko daawa kiya ki ek bhartiya pandubbi pakistan kii jal seemaa ke taraf badhati dekhi gai or usne ghuspaith kii koshishon ko naakaam kar diya
 In order to justify its claim, the Pak Navy also released a video clip on which the original footage of the Indian submarine was written
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne padtaal main paaya ki pakistan kaa yah daawa bhraamak he
 The video clip on which the government of Pa Kistan is making this claim is actually an old video, it has been manipulated with graphics to make this clip come true
 pakistan sarkaar ke aadhikarik taur par bhartiya nausena par aarope lagane se pehle hi mangalvaar subah sepakistani mediamein ye video braking news ke taur par chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 Not only this, the news was also becoming viral on social media that the Pakistan Navy has foiled the attempt of Indian submarine to enter Pakistani waters
 pakistani mediane ye video chalaanaa shuru kar diya or daawa kiya ki pakistan sarkaar ne saboot ke taur par video muhaiyaa karavaaya he
 Not long after this happened, the Imran government also issued an official statement
 mangalvaar dopaherpakistan kii information ministrine pehle twit kiya, uske baad vahaan ke diarector general public relations (navy) ne ye video post karte hue statement jari kiya
 In this video of a total of 50 seconds, for the first few seconds some pictures of submarine are seen which are said to be a file photo of an Indian submarine trying to enter Pakistani waters
 iske baad pani main ek pandubbi kaa mast yani (sabamarine kaa upree hissaa) aage badhata najar aata he
 After this, a band also appears on the 43-second video that reads, "actual footage of Detected Indian Submarine
" " video par najar aa rahi aviation ditels main taarikh, samay or jiyolocation koordinates dikhaai dete hai
 According to this video, the night of 4 March 2019 is 8:35 pm
 bharat main kai soshal media yugers ne is video ko saal 2016 kaa bataaya jab pakistan ne aisa hi daawa kiya tha ki bhartiya pandubbi ne pakistani jal kshetra main ghusane kaa prayaas kiya
 India at the time also denied these claims
 antarrashtriya mediane is ghatana ko pramukhataa se chapa tha
 Pakistan Kadon News also aired this video on 18 November 2016, allegedly saying that the government of Pakistan had given them this video
 hamen is viral ho rahe 43 second ke video main kai samanthaayen najar ain
 The 2016 footage did not have flight data, though the entire video showed the same band that read "actual Footage of Detected Indian Submarine
" "saal 2016 or 2019 donon hi baar pakistan ne keval 43 second kaa chota video dikhaaya jin par ek jaisaa band tha
 After watching the video carefully, it is clear that these are two different parts of the same video
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki video par samay, taarikh or jiyolocation darshane vaala flite data kahaan se aayaa? isaki padtaal karne par hamane paaya ki kisi bhi video par flite data lagaana aasaan kaam he
 For this, software called "dashware" can be used and not only can the flight data be captured in a few minutes but it can also be synced with the data on the screen
 you tubeper kisi video par flite data lagane ke liye kai tutorial videos bhi uplabdh hai
 The Indian government has categorically denied Pakistan's claim, calling it misleading and misleading
