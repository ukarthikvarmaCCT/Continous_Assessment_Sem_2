 lambey samay se uthaai ja rahi is maang ko is bajet main moort rup mil saktaa he
 The National Pension System or NPS is a retirement savings account
 is skim kii shuruyaat bharat sarkaar ne 1 janvari 2004 ko kii thi
 Earlier this scheme was started for government employees only
 haalanki 2009 ke baad ise nijee kshetra ke karmchaariyon ke liye bhi shuru kiya gaya he
 People's tendency towards this National Pension Scheme has not been very special
 logon ne ise kaaphi kam pasand kiya he
 The reason behind this is that the tax exemption is less in the case of other savings schemes
 enpies khatese aap sirf 60 fisadi rakam viddraow kar sakate hai
 After this, 40% of the amount goes as annuity, which is later received as pension
 philhal 60 fisadi macurity amount main se sirf 40 fisadi rakam tex free hoti he
 In this budget, the government can increase this limit from 40 to 60 percent
 agar aisa hota he, to zyada log is skim kii taraf bad sakate he
 Apart from this, the Central Government will try to make this scheme a preferred option among the people to make it attractive like other savings schemes like PPF and EPF
 iske liye sarkaar enpies ke morche par kai ghoshnaaen kar sakati he
 Let me tell you that at the moment PPF account gets a partial tax benefit
 pipief main jamaa hone vaali rakam, is par milane vaale byaaj or macurity par milane vaali rakam par bhi koi tex nahin dena hota he
 Only in these three do you get tax rebate
 enpies main bhi ab macurity tex free ho sakati he
 The Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is run by the bank and the post office
 yah provident fund se alag hoti he or isamen koi bhi apni swechha se khaataa khulavaa saktaa he
 This account can also be opened for at least 100 rupees

 In fact, Salman was in tears when he rebuked him for his actions
 priyanka sharma ne arshi kii personal life se jude aarope lagaae the
 He said that he knew all about Arshi's goa-pune scandal
 iske baad arshi rone lagi thim
 On this action, Salman said about them, you have come back and started spreading dirt
 ye sunakar priyank rone lage
 Priyank had raised his hands on Akash Dudlani for development
 iske baad salmaan ne unhen apane power kaa istemaal karte hue sho se baahar kar diya tha
 Now once again Salman has warned him for the last time
 arshi kii nijee jindagi par sapana boli- 'sab jaanati hum, kya hua tha pune or goa main'bataa den ki priyank sharma or arshi khan kaa vivaad court-kachhari tak pahunch gaya he
 The matter became serious when Priyank made allegations about Arshi's personal life
 priyank ne arshi ke goa or pune sex scandle ko lekar baat kii

 Now the question arises that what was Arshi's alleged sex scandal in Pune and Goa? In 2016, according to a report in Pune Mirror, Pune police had a feeling of being part of Arshi's sex racket
 is maamle main vipul dahal naam ke ek shaks ko agent bataaya gaya tha or giraftaar bhi kiya gaya tha

 According to the report, Arshi had assured the police that they are not connected to it

 His legal team has termed these allegations baseless
 unhone court ke saamne arshi kaa paksh rakhaa he

 input:bhashaa The political battle going on in West Bengal is not taking its name
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne rajyapal kesari nath treepathi par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki bijepi bengal ko gujarat banane kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin bengal gujarat nahin he
 Mamta unveiled the new statue of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar in Kolkata on Tuesday
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki main rajyapal kaa sammaan karti hum lekin har pad kii apni sanvaidhanik seemaa hoti he
 Bengal is being maligned
 agar aap bengal or isaki samskruti ko bachaana chaahate hai to saath aaie
 Efforts are being made to turn Bengal into Gujarat
 bengal gujarat nahin he
 Targeting the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Mamta Banerjee said that we have everything in the documents

 Mamta said in a challenging tone that whoever will harm and leave Bengal and Bengalis' spirit and culture there
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main rojgaar ke morche par sanrachanaatmak badlaav dekha gaya he
 Many new sectors are now getting more jobs, but the government is ending with the stagnation or job cuts in many traditional sectors
 saal 2014 ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan bijepi ne vaada kiya tha ki satta main aane par vah har saal ek karod yuvaaon ko rojgaar degi
 In its manifesto, the BJP had said that 10 years of Congress rule has left the country behind by 20 years and made millions of men and women unemployed
 bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main yah bhi kaha gaya ki menuphaccharing, tourism, iti jaise sector ko badhaava diya jayega, jinamein har saal lakhon rojgaar paidaa karne kii gunjaaish he
 It is clear from the series of quarterly labor surveys that the economy is indeed undergoing structural changes
 ab construction or iti / bipio kii jagah shiksha or swasthya jaise sector main sabase zyada naukariyaan mil rahi hai
 But before the 2019 general elections, the bjp-led government has stopped printing all relevant data about jobs
 timahi shram survey (QES), rojgaar-berogari survey (EUS) or bahupratikshit eneseso ke 2017-18 periodic lebar force survey (PLFS) ko saarvajanik karne se roak diya gaya he
 The reason seems obvious, because all these reports show a blurred picture of jobs in the country
 saal 2008 main congress ke netritv vaale upie sarkaar ne QES kii shuruyaat kii thi taaki shram pradhan aath sector kii nigaraanee ho sake
 With this, suitable steps could be taken in time if needed
 saal 2016 main bijepi sarkaar ne iske scope ko or badhaate hue isamen 80 fisadi sangathit shrambal ko shaamil kar liya
 The new QES series also included manufacturing, tourism and the IT sector
 lekin sarkaar ne oktober 2017 se is survey par hi roak laga di
 Seven surveys of the new QES series, at the top of the manufacturing, health and education sectors, show that there is considerable structural change in the state of jobs in the country
 nirmaan or iti-bipio sector naukariyaan dene ke maamle main agua nahin rah gaye hai or na hi tourism sector main us tarah se lakhon naukariyaan paidaa ho paa rahi hai, jaisaa bijepi ne ummid lagaai thi
 There are now three top sectors in terms of jobs - manufacturing, health and education
 haalanki in sector main bhi bahut zyada naukariyon kaa srijan nahin ho rahaa
 For example, in manufacturing, only 1 in seven quarters (of which there is monitoring)
 99 lakh naukariyaan mili, jabaki kul 1
 49 of all sectors to be monitored with 01 crore jobs
 3 fisadi rojgaar detaa he
 Not only this, there were two quarters in which 12,000 and 87,000 jobs were created in this sector respectively
 iske baad 1
 Education sector second with 89 lakh jobs and 1
 08 lakh naukariyon ke saath health sector tisare sthaan par he
 Overall 80 new jobs in these three sectors during the survey period
 5 fisadi hissaa rahaa
 The QES survey shows that the construction sector jobs declined by 35,000 during this period, while IT-BPO also created only 38,000 new jobs
 haalanki nae QES siries ko bhi andeh kii najar se dekha ja rahaa he, kyonki in aankadon main do bade aarthik jhatkon notebandi or jiesti ke asar ko puri tarah se nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 Demonetisation was implemented in November 2016 and GST in July 2017
 notebandi or jiesti se hue the lakhon berozegarais baat ke ab pratyaksh pramaan saarvajanik rup se uplabdh hai ki is dohare jhatkon ne arthvyavastha ko bepatori par kar diya tha or isse badi sankhya main log berozegaar hue
 a study by The Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows that 1
5 million people lost their jobs in the first four months of 2017
 ol india menuphacturers organijeshan (AIMO) ke mutabik is dohare jatke se sookshm, laghu or madhyam udhyamon (msmes) main 35 lakh log berozegaar ho gaye
 But according to government data, before the ban on demonetisation and GST, there was a cut in jobs in the four sectors - construction, trade, accommodation, restaurants and education - in the quarter of july-october 2016, while the growth in jobs in transport and health sector was also zero
 doing
 haalanki notebandi or jiesti ke baad bhi construction ke alaava baaki sector main naukariyon kii sankhya badhati rahi
 Due to lack of significant growth in job creation for almost a decade, it was necessary that the government monitors the data of jobs in the economy, but perhaps it was not done due to fear of deteriorating image
 naukariyon ke srijan ke bare main aankade lene or iske bare main kuch karne kaa mauka ganvaa diya gaya
 Earlier the job was less, now it is not only that the BJP government promised to create more jobs when it came to power in 2014, but the government is coming to an end with huge job cuts
 eneseso kii 2017-18 pielephes report ko sarkaar ne rashtriya sankhyikee ayog (NSC) se manjuuri milane ke baad bhi teen maheenon tak roke rakhaa, NSC ke pramukh sahit do sadasyon ne virodh main istipha bhi de diya or aakhirkaar yah do akhabaaron main chap gaya
 There is evidence that the government has failed to create jobs
 report ke anusaar saal 2017-18 main berogari dar 6
 1 per cent, which is the highest level in the last 45 years
 saal 2011-12 se 2017-18 ke bich workforce kii sankhya ghatakar 4
 7 crores is left, which means jobs have decreased
 isi tarah shram bal bhagidaari dar (lfpr-naukari karne vaale yaa naukari kii talash main lage kaaryshil jansankhya kaa hissaa) bhi saal 2011-12 ke 55
 49 in 2017-18 as compared to 9 per cent
 5 fisadi rah gai he
 This means that nearly half of the working population (15–60 years) is out of jobs, because there are no jobs
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni china yatra ko lekar kaaphi utsahit dikh rahe hai
 He said on Wednesday that he was confident that his visit would lay the foundation for increasing cooperation in several areas with China and strengthen stability, progress and prosperity in Asia
 modi ne angreji orchini bhashaa main twitakia, ‘hamaari do pracheen sabhyataaon or do sabase bade vikasshil deshon ke bich dosti ko badhaane ke liye 14 se 16 may tak china yatra ko lekar ashanvit hum
 In Chinese, he said he would visit Xi'an, the native place of President Xi Jinping, besides Beijing and Shanghai
 modi ne twit kiye, ‘main raashtrapatishi jinping or pradhanmantri lee kwingke saath sakaaratmak baatcheet kaa utsukata se intjaar kar rahaa hum
 i am confident that my visit will lay the foundation for further expansion of economic cooperation with China in many areas
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe vishwaas he ki china kii meri yatra asia main sthirataa, pragati or samruddhi ko majboot karegi
 Modi said that he is also looking forward to meeting industrialists in Shanghai and wants to share with them the great opportunities in India
 china ke alaavaamodi mongolia kii bhi yatra karenge
 "I am also happy to visit Mongolia on 17 May to mark 60 years of our diplomatic relations with Mongolia and the Silver Jubilee Year of Mongolia's democracy
" ’ Instead of running on the treadmill in the gym, if you like running between the cursory winds, exercising in the glass in the gym, instead of seeing your sweaty face looking green, then you would surely worry about air pollution more than others
 dilli jaise mahanagaron main sardiyon main smog kaa kahar is kadar ho jaataa he ki eksrasij kya, kabhi kabhi saans lenaa bhi mushkil ho jaataa he
 So the question arises that should we go out and do some exercise because of fear of air pollution? There is no doubt that breathing in poisonous air containing carbon mono oxide damages the lungs
 asthma, heart atake, stroke, cancer jaisi bimariyon kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 When people perform aerobic activity, people draw more breath in and the breath goes deeper into the lungs
 iske alaava eksrasij ke dauraan log zyaadaatar munh se saans lene lagate hai
 Due to not breathing through the nose, the air is not filtered and harmful pollutants reach more quantity inside the body
 vaayu pradooshan hone par bacchon or buudhon ko baahar eksrasij karne se khaskar bachanaa chahie
 If you are not exercising, then you may have health problems when exposed to air pollution
 lekin vaayu pradooshan or eksrasij kaa combination zyada khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Air pollution increases the risk of headaches, itching in the eyes, damage to lungs, risk of asthma, risk of heart attack and stroke, lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases
 mahanagaron main vaayu pradooshan kaa str kai baar vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke maanakon se bahut zyada hota he
 However, it is unclear how long exposure to air pollution poses a threat or what type of air pollution poses a greater risk of exposure
 duusari taraf eksrasij karne se bahut se phaayde hote hai isliye eksrasij karnaa chhod dena bilkul sahi nahin he
 Research has also revealed that the benefits of regular exercise outweigh the dangers of air pollution
 eksrasij karen lekin koshish karen ki aaf vaayu pradooshan ke kam sampark main aaen
 You can reduce the ill effects of air pollution, just for this you should adopt these suggestions
 vaayu pradooshan ke str par najar rakhen-apane ilaake main vaayu pradooshan ke badhate str ko lekar jari hone vaale alert par najar rakhen
 With the help of all the apps, you can also estimate the level of air pollution
 apane workout ke liye samay kaa chunaav soch samajhakar karen
 When an alert on air quality has been issued, avoid going outside to exercise
 apni physical activity kaa samay kam kar len or intecity gata len
 Avoid exercising in the morning and evening
 kahaan karen outdoor eksrasij?jis samay baahar bheedbhad yaa trephic zyada rahata ho, us samay eksrasij karne baahar naa nikalen
 Avoid visiting areas with high pollution
 sadak ke 400 meter ke daayre ke andar pradooshan kaa str zyada hota he
 Choose a quiet and crowded place for exercise
 jab vaayu gunvattta behad kharaab ho to gym yaa ghar ke andar eksrasij karen
 If you have diseases like asthma or diabetes, please consult your doctor

 The state government is looking for about 1
25 acres of land for this
 is vishvavidhyalay ke liye vistrut kaaryayojna banaai ja rahi he
 The Central Government's help will also be taken in its construction
 tippaniyan Uttar Pradesh Sports Minister Chetan Chauhan said, the department is working on setting up a sports university for sports and sports management in Uttar Pradesh

 This university will also have a b
p
ed degree course
 lekin ham pehali baar khel prabandhan par emb jaisaa ek vishesh paathyakram bhi shuru karnaa chaahate hai
 Chauhan said that the course of sports management is very important that for every sports competition, an event management or a private company is required, but since they do not have enough knowledge about sports, so often we want to organize the event like Can not be done
 jab khel prabandhan paathyakram karne ke baad koi yuvak khel prabandhan kaa kaam karegaa to vah us khel ke bare main acchhee tarah se samajhegaa or behatar tareeke se aayojan kaa kaam kar sakegaa
 He said that this will also provide employment opportunities to the people associated with sports, as well as to organize the games in a better way

 He was asked that there will be no cricket in this university, on this he said that there will be cricket but since there are many academies for this game, special emphasis will be on Indian sports
 unhone kaha ki is vishvavidhyalay main vibhinn khelon ke prashikshak coach banane ke liye vishesh prashikshan kaarykram bhi honge taaki apane khel se sanyas lene ke baad khilaadi coach kaa course kar nayi pratibhaaon ko prashikshit karne kaa kaam kar saken or rojgaar ke avasar paa saken

 unhone kaha ki isse khel se jude logon ke liye rojgaar ke avasar bhi uplabdh honge saath hi saath khelon kaa aayojan bhi behatar tareeke se ho sakegaa

 unase poocha gaya ki is vishvavidhyalay main cricket nahin hoga is par unhone kaha ki cricket bhi hoga lekin chunki is khel ke liye kai academiyaan he isaliye vishesh jor bhartiya khelon par rahegaa
 He said that this university will also have special training programs to make coaches coaches of different sports so that after retiring from their sports, players can take the course of coaches and work to train new talent and get employment opportunities
 khel mantri se poocha gaya ki is vishwavidayalay ke liye shikshak kahaan se laayenge to unhone kaha ki vibhinn khelon ke puraane khilaadiyon ko vishvavidhyalay joda jayega or saath hi atithi shikshakon ke rup main vibhinn khelon jude videshi khilaadiyon tathaa prashikshakon ko bhi samay samay par bulaayenge

 It is said that Bhagat Singh was feared to be hanged by his mother Vidyavati to have an unbroken recital at a gurdwara to protect his life
 is par paath karne vaale granthi ne prarthana karte hue kaha, ‘guru sahab, maa chaahati he ki uske bete kii jindagi batch jaae, lekin betaa desh ke liye qurbaan ho janaa chahta he
 i have put both sides in front of you, which seems fine
 ’shahid e ajam ke pautra (bhattije babar singh sandhu ke putr) yadvinder singh ne parivaar ke bade sadasyon ke sansmaranon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki vidyavati jab bhagat singh ke jivan kii raksha ke liye aradaas karne gurudware gayi to bhagat singh ne unase kaha tha ki vah desh par balidaan ho jane kii apane bete kii khwaahish kaa sammaan karen
 He said that when Vidyavati reached the jail to meet Bhagat Singh, Shaheed A
 Azam asked him what Granthi said
 is par maa ne sari baat bataai or bhagat singh ne iske jawaab main kaha, ‘maa aapke guru sahiban bhi yahi chaahate hai ki main desh par qurbaan ho jaaun kyonki isse bada koi or punya nahin he
 Dying for the country is bigger than your love
 ’yadvinder ne bataaya ki bhagat singh chaahate the ki jab unhen faansee ho to unki parthiv deh unka chota bhai kulbir ghar le jaae or unki maa us samay jail main haragij nahin aaen
 However, this desire of Bhagat Singh could not be fulfilled as the British hanged him a day before the scheduled time and in pieces burned his body on the banks of the Sutlej River
 unke anusaar bhagat singh ne apni maa se kaha tha, ‘maa meraa shav lene aap nahin aana or kulbir ko bhej dena
 Because if you come you will cry and i do not want people to say that Bhagat Singh's mother is crying

 According to the family, Shaheed A
 Azam was named Bhagat Singh due to his name being 'bhaga Wala' (lucky One)

 is bare main baat karnaa or apana-aapnaa experions share karnaa unka or aaropee ko moulik adhikaar he
 Talking on such issues is very good for the interest of society so that awareness is spread
 lekin durbhagyavash bharat ke zyaadaatar purushon ko jis tarah se unki maae paalati hai, unhen itani bhi tahjeeb nahin hoti ki peshaab karne se pehle pot ke dhakkan ko uthaaya jaataa he
 After this sharp statement, Kangana said, 'it is very important to tell the king son the meaning of NO
 ab samaaj ko raja betaaon ko wo sikhaane or bataane kii jarurat he jise bataane main unke mata-pita asafal rahe hai
 It is necessary to convince them that fundamental rights are equal for both men and women
 vishwaas kariye jab unhen ye bataaya jayega to ye unke liye ye ek news hogi
 'tanushree-nana controversy: The film's AD eyes looked uprooted, actress Kangana Ranaut also said that these days the news of rape, exploitation and molestation is coming, seeing these people in the category of human beings is wrong
 kangana ne boleen- 'mujhe lagata hahame is tarah kii ghatnaon ke bare main baat kerani chahie or apane saath hue vaakyon ko bhi ujagar karnaa chahie
 By doing this, this fear will surely arise in the hearts of those who commit such crimes, that a girl can raise her voice against the incident that ever happened to her
 kyonki hamaari jindagi kii is tarah kii kahaniyon kii koi expyri date nahin hoti

 Bagga said that we are inspired by the heroic sacrifice of the Sikh Gurus and in such a situation, removing the history of the Sikh creed whose sacrifices were kept due to the sacrifice is in itself a shameful step for which Captain Government should be criticized

 The debate may be followed by a vote
 yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki sthiti kya banati he
 Your sent photos on Anna's movement After this meeting, Law Minister Salman Khurshid said that we are concerned about Hazare's health
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ek prastaav or ek majboot vidheyak chaahate hai lekin har baat se pehle ham unka anshan samaapt chaahate hai kyonki hamen unke swasthya kii chintaa he
 What is Jan Lokpal Bill? When Khurshid was asked if the government had received any promise from the Anna team, he said that there is hope but no promise
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar aashaa karti he ki din ke dauraan kisi bhi prakaar kii sahmati se unhen hamaari gambhirtha, ichha or eemaandaaree ke bare main manaaya ja sakegaa ki ham yah sunishchit karnaa chaahate hai ki ek acha majboot lokapal vidheyak ho
 Special coverage Senior Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, who met Anna, spoke to him twice over the phone and apprised him of the seriousness of the government on the issues raised by him
 loksabhaa janalokapal vidhyek or samaaj ke anya vidheyak praroopon par charchaa karne vaali thi lekin ain vakt par congress or bhaajapa prakriyaagat muddon ko lekar ulajh gayi or ab aaj ek alag rup main yah mudda aa saktaa he
 Differences arose in the Anna team over Kejriwal's 'class' on the Jan Lokpal Bill, Hazare's fast
 udhar, unke swasthya ko lekar doctor chintaa main pad gaye lekin hajaare ne pradhanmantri ko bheji chitthee yah maang karte hue 11 dinon se jari anshan todane se manaa kar diya ki unke teen muddon par sansad main prastaav paarit ho jane par vah anshan tod denge
 Public Parliament is higher than Parliament: The three major demands Anna Hazare has made include bringing the lower level officers under the Lokpal, setting up Lokayuktas in the states and making Citizen Charter
 sarkari lokapal vidheyak kii jagah doosraa vidheyak pesh karne kii sambhaavnaaon se inkaar karne vaale mukherjee ne ab shanivaar ko loksabhaa main bayaan de sakate hai jo charchaa kaa aadhaar banegaa
 The country is threatened by traitors: In Anna Hazaredin, opposition members had given notice to discuss the issue of Lokpal under the rule that there is a provision for voting but the members of Congress want it to be done under a rule which does not have voting provision is
 shuukravaar ko sansad main matdaan kii ummid kar rahi team anna ne kadi pratikriya dete hue kaha ki anna hajaare apana anshan tabhi samaapt karenge jab unki teenon maangon par sahmati bane yaa kam se kam jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main pesh kiya jaae

 mediapart has said that Dassau had visited his Indian partner Reliance Defense before the deal for Rafale aircraft, then he had only found the warehouse there and he was conditioned to choose Reliance as partner
 bharat main rafel vimaan saude ko lekar raajnneetik dal sarkaar par aarope laga rahe hai
 The main opposition party Congress is constantly raising questions about Rafale aircraft prices and choosing Reliance Defense as an offset partner in the deal
 desh ke supreme court ne bhi sarkaar se kaha he ki uske saamne is deal kii puri prakriya rakhi jaae
 Explain that Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is currently on a visit to France
 vahiin, mediapart ke aaropon par daso ne vistrut jawaab diya he
 Dassau says there was a government-level agreement between France and India in September 2016
 isamen daso ne bharat sarkaar ko 36 rafel vimaan beche the
 The company has stated that it had promised to choose an Indian company as an offset partner in accordance with Indian regulations (defense Procurement Procedure) and the tradition of such deals
 iske liye company ne joint-venture banane kaa faisla kiya
 Dassault Company has said that it had chosen Reliance Group as an offset partner of its own accord
 yah joint-venture daso reliance airospes limited (DRAL) farvari 2017 main banaaya gaya
 BTSL, DEFSYS, Kinetic, Mahindra, Miani, Samtel
 
 Other agreements were made with the companies

 The website claimed that Dassau's representative visited Anil Ambani's company when the satellite image showed that there was only one ware house, apart from this no facility was present
 website kii ore se jari kiye gaye dastavejon kii mutabik french company daso ke saamne anil ambani ke company reliance ke saath rafel deal karne kii shart rakhi gai thi or iske alaava koi anya vikalp nahin diya gaya tha
 Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Dashau Aviation said this clearly while giving a presentation in front of the staff of both companies in Nagpur
 mediapart ne apane dastavej main yah daawa kiya he
 Dassau's deputy CEO gave this statement in Nagpur on 11 May 2017
 haalanki jab mediapart kii ore se is bare main daso company se pratikriya maangi gai to unhone is dastavej kii baton ko sire se khaarij karte hue tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Explosive revelation in French media: an internal Dassault document says the Reliance offset deal was a "trade-off", "imperative and obligatory" to clinch the # Rafaledeal
 ⁦@incindia⁩https: / / t
 co / 2ximmgwl9k —shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor) October 10, 2018 a few days ago, the French website quoted former French President François Hollande as proposing the name of Anil Ambani's Reliance for the Rafale deal
 
 daso aviation company ke paas koi or vikalp nahin tha
 Hollande said that the name of Reliance was given by the Government of India
 ise chunane main daso kii bhoomika nahin he
 Adway Planley, president of Media Part, who published Holland's interview, told India Today that Hollande was very clear about the deal
 unhone deal ke vakt anil ambani kii maujuudagi ko lekar bharat sarkaar se sawaal kiye the
 Reliance was forcibly imposed in this case by the Indian government
 pehle qaraar 100 se zyada vimaan ko lekar tha, lekin baad main bharat sarkaar ne 36 vimaanon par sahmati jataai
 In the wake of the reshuffle in the Modi cabinet, the appointment of ministers who are being canceled - the competition for knowing the date of booking Ashok Hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan - Tomar's name plate landed from the Ministry of Urban Development, the countdown for the reshuffle has started in the Union Council of Ministers
 bhaajapa ke saansad or mantri yahmaan kar chal rahe hai ki sitambar ke pehle saptaah tak mantrimandal main pherbadal ho jayega
 Therefore, since 25 August, as a minister, approvals have been canceled for attendance as guests of the program
 pherbadal kab ho rahaa he yah jaanane ke liye vibhinn netaaon or mantriyonke khaas log raashtrapati bhawan main phone kar yah jaanane ki koshish kar rahe hai ki ashok holkis tithi ke liye book he
 Significantly, the oath taking ceremony is usually held in this hall
 pradhanmantrinarendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah se mantrimandal main pherbadal ko lekar partike andar se bahut saare sawaal hai
 But the biggest question is, who will ask them the question? In such a situation, the ministers, who do not feel secure in their posts, are themselves coming into the mode of leave
 venkaiya naidu ke uparshtrapati banane ke baad shahari vikaas mantralay kshatirikt prabhaav dekh rahe narendra singh tomars ke mantralay sthit chembar se nem platehata liya gaya he
 a Brahmin minister coming from Uttar Pradesh has canceled all his appointments after 25 August
 pashchimi uttar pradesh se aane waleek mantri bataur mantri kii jagah bhaajapa saansad ke naate kaarykram main upasthit honeka samay dene lage hai
 Amidst all this, the current ministers are seen to be cutting their cards, which Amit Shah had said in the Chief Ministers meeting held recently that some should come forward to fulfill the responsibility of the organization in order to make the government stand
 ravishankar prasad,mahesh sharma,nirmala sitaraman,piyush goyal,dharmendra pradhan,jepi nadda,rajeev pratap rudi un mantriyon main shaamil hanzinhe amit shah sarkaar kaa ruukh majbootee se rakhane ke liye badhai de chuke hai
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that many of them should be asked to come and serve in the organization so that the development work of the Modi government can be reached to the people in a better way

 In the matter of land acquisition, the central government has defended its ordinance with full force
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki maujuuda kanoon rahul gandhi ko khush karne ke liye laayaa gaya tha, jisamen kai sari khamiyaan thim, lihaaja yah adhyadesh laana padaa
 Rural Development Minister Birendra Singh on Friday hit back at the opposition, saying that there were many flaws in the old Land Acquisition Act
 birendra singh ne kaha, "rahul gandhi ko khush karne ke liye itani sari galtiyaan kii gayi
 
 
 Now we have to suffer that
 " Defending the Land Acquisition Ordinance, Rural Development Minister Birendra Singh, apart from making a political attack on the opposition, also gave administrative arguments
 unhone daawa kiya ki ye adhyadesh kisaan virdohi nahin he, kanoon kii mul bhaavana ke saath he
 Birendra Singh reminded that in June itself, 32 states and union territories had demanded a change in the law and said that if the ordinance were not there, many laws would have been difficult to implement
 gramin vikaas mantri ne daawa kiya ki agar 31 disambar tak adhyadesh nahin laayaa jaataa, to 13 mahatvapurn kanoonon ko sahi tareeke se lagu karnaa mushkil hota
 But it is being told that the new conditions for land acquisition exemption will change the original law by about 70 percent
 doosraa ahm sawaal ye he ki jis bill ko puri sansad ne aam sahmati se kanoon kii shakl di thi, use bina sansad main laae kyon badal diya gaya
 Bypassing the opposition's allegations, the Rural Development Minister has justified the Land Acquisition Ordinance, now the next challenge before him will be to get the ordinance approved by Parliament in the budget session

 The confluence of madhuri-juhi is amazing
 yah kahana katai galat nahin hoga ki film dekhne laayak he
 It can be said that its color will be very rich in Hindi belt
 bollywood main is tarah kii filmein kam banati hai
 Which has action and both of its lead characters are women
 saumik sen ne yah kar dikhaaya he
 How powerful the story is of Madhopur in North India
 jahaan rajjo (maadhuri) mahilaon kaa ashram chalaati he
 The cottage makes them stand on their feet through industry
 unka puraa ek samooh he jo mahilaon par hone vaale atyaacharon ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he
 Then there is the game of politics
 rajjo kaa badhata prabhaav kuch logon ko khatkata he
 Then comes Sumitra Devi (juhi) who changes the entire scene
 vah netaa hai or rajjo kii lokapriyata kaa istemaal karnaa chaahati he
 Then begins a game of trickery, tremendous action
 maadhuri ne jise bakhubi parade par utaarne kii koshish kii he or vah apni is duusari pari main dhak-dhak girl kii image se baahar nikalne kii koshish karti dikhti hai
 There is Holi in the film, there is politics, there is the story of women, there are court scenes, there is jail and there is a lot of emotions
 yani bharpoor masala he
 It would not be wrong to say that the star appellation says that the Gulab gang is bound to see Madhuri and Juhi
 donon ne behtareen acting kii he
 In many scenes, Juhi falls heavily on Madhuri
 kul milakar donon apane kairactor main ghus jaati hai or gaharaai tak apil karti hai
 The only thing that stings is that both the actresses are of a 'soft face', somewhere they realize this
 unke saath najar ain tanishta chatarji, priyanka bose or divya jagadale ne bhi dhyaan khinchaa he
 The story of the film is a bit new
 hindi pattee ke darshakon ko conect karti he
 Sampat also shows Pal's life well
 saumik kii riting or diarection donon hi achche hai
 The budget of the film is also said to be medium
 phir juhi or maadhuri kii kamaal acting film ko ek baar dekhne laayak to banaati hi he
 Anyway, making such a meaningful action film for women in Bollywood is a really new endeavor
 baaki sab audiyans conect par he

 com / pvaw5jlfbd An important achievement for Team India in the series against Australia was the improved performance of their fast bowlers
 khaastaur se tej gendbaaj umesh yadav main gajab kaa sudhaar dekha gaya or unhone puri siries main australian ballebaajon kii naak main dam kar diya
 Batsmen like David Warner, Steve Smith, who specializes in fast bowling, also looked uncomfortable in front of his balls
 siries main 17 wicket le chuke umesh yadav ne yah gendbaaji bharat ke un viketon par kii, jo tej gendbaaji ke lihaaj se nirjeev maane jate hai or jisamen australiya ke world class tej gendbaaj bhi utane prabhavi nahin rahe
 Umesh also played magic in Dharamsala Test and took five wickets
 duusari pari main to unhone australian pari ko tahas-nahas kar diya
 In this, Bhuvneshwar Kumar supported him well
 is bich umesh or bhuvi kii david warner se kahasuni bhi hui
 On the third day of the match, after beating the Australian team for just 137 runs, the team India's fast bowler duo questioned each other about bowling
 
 
 isamen donon ne match ke dauraan ballebaajon ke prati apane gusse or ranneeti kaa khulaasa kiya
 
 
 In fact on the third day of the match, the Australian team was behind by just 32 runs and it was believed that they could take a big lead over Team India, but as soon as their innings started, the Indian fast bowler duo made both Kangaroo openers
 Did not even get a chance to breathe and showered bouncers on them
 ve har duusari gend par umesh or bhuvi ke aage sangharsh karte dikhe
 During the conversation with BCCI TV, Bhuvneshwar Kumar first questioned Umesh, then Bhuvi answered Umesh's questions
 
 
 bhuvi : aapane bounsar khundak (gusse) main kii thim yaa phir aisa kisi yojana ke tahat kiya? Umesh: There were plans as well as Khunnas
 jab main ballebaaji kar rahaa tha, to mujh par bounsar phenki gayi
 When i went back, at that time i thought that our turn would also come and we can also put bouncers
 bhuvi : kya isamen majaa aayaa? Umesh: Enjoyed a lot
 jab unke gendbaaj pat camins ne bounsar daale, to maine sochaa ki hamane pehali pari main bahut kam bounsar kiye hai, isliye hamane duusari pari main zyada se zyada bounsar karne kii yojana banaai
 Bhuvi: Can you tell us about the two wickets of Rainshaw and Warner? umesh : jab main bounsar kar rahaa tha, to mujhe raneshow asahaj najar aae or jab main bounsaron ke bich-bich length par hit kar rahaa tha, to vah chakma khate dikhe
 He did not understand whether to go forward or to retreat
 warner soch rahe the ki main back length par gend daaloongaa, lekin maine unhen isse pehle kaaphi gendbaaji kii hui thi or maine tay kiya ki is baar unhen thodaa phul length par gend kerani hogi or maine yahi kiya
 Bhuvi: Did you do sledding with Warner? umesh : vah bahut jaldi hi out ho gaye, isliye mujhe unke saath slage karne kaa samay hi nahin mila
 Anyway i do not do sledging but rather show agression
 iske baad swing ke ustad bhubaneshwar ne umesh yadav ke sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Bhuvi also troubled the Kangaroos in the second innings and was seen throwing a bouncer
 
 
 tippaniyan Umesh: What was your plan to bounce Warner? bhuvi : jab main batting kar rahaa tha, to pat camins gendbaaji kar rahe the
 At that time Warner asked me if it is faster! Then when i harassed him with the bouncer, i asked him, 'this one was fast what
 ' maine pehle hi soch liya tha ki jab main warner ko gendbaaji karuunga, to unase yahi sawaal karuunga
 i was glad that i gave a witty reply to me
 isamen bahut majaa aayaa
 Umesh: What was the thinking behind the ball that you dismissed Smith? bhuvi : vastav main unke bare main maine zyada kuch nanhin sochaa tha
 He was a bit difficult to bowl in the way he was batting
 aisi sthiti main vah keval isi tareeke se out ho sakate the

 He was a bit difficult to bowl in the way he was batting
 aisi sthiti main vah keval isi tareeke se out ho sakate the
 Bhuvi: Did you do the bouncer in Khundak (anger) or did it under any plan? umesh : yojana bhi thi or khunnas bhi
 When i was batting, a bouncer was thrown at me
 jab main waapas gaya, to us samay maine sochaa tha ki hamaari baari bhi aegi or ham bhi bounsar daal sakate hai
 Bhuvi: Was it fun? umesh : bahut majaa aayaa
 When their bowler, Pat Cummins, put the bouncers, i thought we had very few bouncers in the first innings, so we planned to have as many bouncers in the second innings
 bhuvi : kya aap hamen renshow or warner ke do vikaton ke bare main bataa sakate hai? Umesh: When i was doing a bouncer, i found Renshaw uncomfortable and when i was hitting the length between bouncers, he was dodging
 unhen yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki aage jaaun yaa peeche hatuun
 Warner was thinking that i would bowl at the back length, but i bowled him a lot earlier and i decided that this time he would have to bowl at full length and that's what i did
 bhuvi : kya aapane warner ke saath sledging kii thi? Umesh: He was out very soon, so i did not get time to sledge with him
 vaise bhi main sledgingle nahin karata balki agreshan dikhaata hum
 After this, the master of the swing, Bhubaneswar answered the questions of Umesh Yadav
 bhuvi ne bhi duusari pari main kangaaroon ko jamkar pareshaan kiya or bounsar phenkate najar aae
 
 
 The comments umesh : warner ko bounsar karne ko lekar aapaki kya yojana thi? Bhuvi: When i was batting, Pat Cummins was bowling
 us samay warner ne mujhase poocha ki zyada tej he! phir jab maine unhen bounsar se pareshaan kiya, to maine unase poocha, 'ye vaala tej tha kya
 'I had already thought that when i bowled Warner, i would ask him the same question
 mujhe khushi is baat kii hui ki maine jaise ko taise vaala jawaab diya
 It was great fun
 umesh : aapane smith ko jis gend par out kiya, uske peeche kya soch thi? Bhuvi: Actually i didn't think much about them
 vah jis tarah se batting kar rahe the, usamen unhen gendbaaji karnaa thodaa mushkil kaam tha
 In such a situation, he could only get out this way
 bhuvi : kya isamen majaa aayaa? Umesh: Enjoyed a lot

 mujhe nahin lagata
 He said, he has to ask himself this question
 vah aise khilaadi nahin hai, jo kariyar ke aakhir main sangharsh karnaa nahin chaahate honge
 It will be difficult
 hamane dekha he ki in donon shrunkhalaaon main vah sangharsh karte dikhe
 They have to consider it and the Indian selectors too

 Dravid said that he wants Zaheer to end his career brilliantly
 unhone kaha, vah kapil dev ke baad bharat ke sarvshereshth gendbaaj rahe hai

 Regarding the Indian spinners, Dravid said that even before, they have been battling in foreign conditions and people have to be restrained with them
 unhone kaha, hamen spinneron ke maamle main thodaa dhiraj rakhana hoga
 Whether it is Ashwin or Jadeja
 donon ke liye antarrashtriya cricket main yah shuruaati daur he
 "we have seen that some of India's greatest spinners, including Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, have taken time to adapt themselves to the Kookaboora ball on foreign pitches," Dravid said
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki aswin ke maamle main hamane sanyam nahin rakhaa he
 We have not given him that many opportunities, so i think he should give some more matches to the team
 vah anubhav ke saath hi sikhega

 The Joker's character became immortal in 2008 with Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight
 is film main hith lager ne joker kii bhoomika nibhaai thi or yah kirdaar itnaa dark tha ki film release hone ke samay tak hith ne apane kamare main aatmahatya kar lee thi
 After his death, Heath received an Oscar for his best performance
 prashansakon ko lagata rahaa ki hith lager se behatar joker kaa kirdaar nibhaana kisi ke liye bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 In the 2014 film 'deadpool', Jared Leto introduced the audience to a new clown clown, but failed to meet the audience's expectations
 haalanki 'dark nite' kii relies ke 11 saal baad vaakeen finnics ne apni haroonges parformens se hith lager ke kirdaar ko aakhirkaar chunauti de daali he or hith kii tarah hi phinics bhi auskar ke majboot daavedaar ke taur par ubhare hai
 Some films leave you empty
 aap main kuch kirdaar is qadar utarate hai ki aap ek trans main chale jate hai
 After the film is over, the characters come out of the theater with you in your space
 arthur flek bhi kuch-kuch aisa hi he!main yah nahin kah sakati ki arthur se mujhe muhabbat he yaa nafrat
 It's just that his character has stayed in Zehn
 film shuru hoti he ek dark or glumi jagah se
 Whose name is Gotham City
 shahar ek tarah ke hadtaal se guzar rahaa jiske tahat shahar main faile gandagee kii safaai nahin ho paa rahi
 Fat mice run out of their burrows and run towards the garbage heap
 ye chuuhe shahar ke sabase garib tabake ko signifaai karte hai
 The whole city is bathed in yellow light, but in this yellow light there is no happiness, depression seems to dissolve
 log bemasad yahaan se vahaan aate-jate dikh rahe hote hai
 In such a situation there is the entry of our hero Arthur, who can be a villain for anyone
 arthur ne apni aadhi zindagi mufalisi or apni biimaar maa kii dekh-rekh karte hue guzaar di he
 But he has not given up his dreams
 use yaqiin he ki ek din wo stand-ap kamedian zarur banegaa
 Currently, to run home, he becomes a clown and sometimes goes to a hospital for sick children, sometimes he holds a flyer on the streets
 lekin uskaa hona kisi ke liye myne nahin rakhata
 No one cares about his happiness or sorrow
 bheed main hota he magar kisi ko bhi vah nahin dikhataa
 But later we learn that Arthur is mentally ill
 bachapan main use molest kiya gaya, saath hi saath uske sir par kisi chiz se maaraa gaya, or isi vajah se na chaahate hue bhi vah ‘histyrian hansi’ hansane lagata he
 This laughter is such that the people around start getting uncomfortable
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, zindagi bhar wo is qadar akelaa rahaa he ki ab usne jaagti ankhon se sapane bunane shuru kar die hai
 He is going on a date with someone in his dream world
 jab wo apni biimaar maa ke paas akelaa baitha he to uski preyasi uskaa maathaa chuum le rahi he
 But then these are Arthur's dreams
 haqiqat se bilkul alahada
 Tests of life are left for him
 log jinhen apane alaava kisi kii bhi nahin padi, jo white collar job main hai
 Those who feel that the world is at their shoes
 aise logon se arthur kaa saamana hona baaqi he
 Arthur does not even know that his father is the richest man in the city
 arthur jaise-jaise duniya ke qareeb jaataa he use is duniya kaa kurup cheharaa nazar aane lagata he
 This world is such that the powerful are becoming more powerful and the poor and destitute are being pressed and crushed
 ye majaboor log sirf chunaav ke vaqt netaaon ko yaad aate hai baaqi uske baad wo zindaa hai yaa mar gayi kisi ko farq nahin padataa
 But how long will someone bear injustice? arthur ko bhi ek din lagata he ki ab bahut ho gaya
 You have to take a stand for yourself
 apane haq ke liye ladanaa hi padegaa
 Then Arthur Flake becomes Arthur's clown
 joker, jo sirf ab bacchon ko hansaane kaa kaam nahin karata, balki on da spot faisalaa karata he kiye ja rahe gunaah kaa
 Conception of the film starts from here
 kuch logon ko lag rahaa he ki mental ilnes kii aad le kar tod-filp (film ke nirdeshak) serial-kiling ko glorifaai kar rahen
 Arthur means the Joker does not have the right to kill someone
 magar arthur ab un sabhi dabe-kuchle logon ke liye hero ban chukaa he jinke liye koi stand nahin letaa
 From this perspective, the Joker is the hero for you

 majaruuh sultanpurine 50 or 60 ke dashak membollywoodfilm industry ko ek se badhkar ek nagamen die
 Who can forget the songs of friendship film
 dev anand ke kai superhit gaanon ke peeche majaruuh kii hi kalam kaa jaadu chipa tha
 Majrooh classed the tunes from Naushad to Anu Malik with their words
 unke janmdin par unke jivan se judi kuch baaten-1- unka puraa naam asraar ul hasan khan tha
 But the world came to be known as Majrooh Sultanpuri
 uttar pradesh ke azamgarh jile ke nizamabad gaanv main 1 oktober, 1919 ko janm hua
 Here his father was posted in the police department
 purakhon kii asal jameen sultanpur main thi
 2-naushadse worked with Anu Malik and Jatin Lalit, AR Rahman and Leslie Lewis
 1965 main film 'dosti' ke gane 'chaahunga main tuje sanjh savere' ke liye filmphere aword jeeta
 He was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1993
 3- pita nahin chaahate the ki betaa angreji siikhe
 So they were sent to the madrasa
 yahaan unhone arabi or farsi jabaan sikhi
 Majrooh's father worked in the police department
 4- aalim banane ke baad vah lakhanu pahunche
 Learning Unani system of medicine
 phir ek din is asafal hakim kii kismat ne karavat lee
 He recited his Ghazal at a Mushaira in Sultanpur
 logon kii daad unhen itani sachhee or hausalabaksh lagi ki unhone tay kar liya ki bahut hua naadee jaanchane kaa kaam
 5- He increased the number of Mushayars
 jigar muradaabadi kii shagirdi bhi shuru kar di
 'I went alone, Janib-e-magar but people came along and became caravans
 '6- 1945 main majaruuh ek mushaayare main shaamil hone ke liye bombai aae
 His ghazals and nazams were well liked by the people
 sunne waalon main ek the produsar eaar kardaar
 Hearing the words of Majrooh, Kardar reached his mentor Jigar Muradabadi for recommendation
 magar majaruuh ne filmon ke liye likhane se inkaar kar diya
 In the Adabi section, such work was considered light in those days
 phir jigar ne samajhaayaa
 Money is good in this
 parivaar ko madad ho jaaegi
 7- Then the Kardar took Majrooh to Naushad
 unhone majaruuh ko ek tun sunai or kaha, iske meter par kuch likho
 Majrooh wrote, 'when he spread the gesu, the clouds came to the jhum
 ' naushaad ko ye lafj pasand aae or unhen film 'shahjahan' ke liye bataur geetkaar rakh liya gaya
 In this, KL Sehgal sang, 'when the heart is broken'
 sahagal chaahate the ki unki aakhri yatra main yahi gaanaa baje
 8- The film journey of Majrooh has started
 mehboob kaa andaaj, shahid latif kii araju
 But his association with the well-known camp was reflected in his rebellious attitude
 1949 main unhembalraj saahnijaise kai vamapanthiyon ke saath jail main daal diya gaya
 He was told to apologize, otherwise he would be jailed for two years
 jail main rahane ke dauraan hi unki badi beti hui
 The family faced financial crisis
 tab raaj kapur ne majaruuh kaa likhaa 'duniya banane vaale kya tere man main samaai' kharida or parivaar ko us vakt hajaar rupee die iske aivaj main
 9- Majrooh Sultanpuri was the first songwriter to be awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award
 10- 24 may, 2000 ko unka nidhan ho gaya
 Due to pneumonia attack us vakt unki umr thi 80 baras
 Chahte mainge tujhe saanjh svere, yet sometime ab naam ko tere, this song from the friendship film, for which Majrooh received the first Filmfare Award

 ’ As soon as the results of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections came on December 23, it seemed that the barometer of public meetings had knocked out the People's Democratic Party (PDP)
 bijepi ko 25 siten milane se uske belgaum josh ko saanp soongh gaya
 The victory in just 28 seats shocked the PDP so much that it was also hesitant to celebrate its emergence as the largest party in the state
 nateezon se 24 ghante pehle pidipi ko puraa bharosa tha ki rajya main agali sarkaar uski banegi
 Now it is a matter of relief that the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley stopped the bjp's victory chariot at the Jawahar tunnel
 bijepi ne ghati main 46 main se 34 siton par ummidavaar khadey kiye the, jinamein se 33 kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 The BJP was a huge success, winning unexpected 25 seats in the Jammu region
 rajya main party ke chunaav prachaar sanchaalak mahasachiv ram madhav yah bataate hue apni khushi chipa nahin paa rahe the ki rajya main pehali baar koi muslim ummidavaar bijepi ke tikat par jeeta he
 In Kalakot, bjp's Abdul Ghani Kohli created a new political history in the state by defeating National Conference (NC) Hindu candidate Rachpal Singh
 ram madhav ne bijepi kii is jeet ko jansangh ke sansthaapak shyama prasad mukherjee ko samarpit kiya jinhone rajya main anuchhed 370 lagu kiye jane ke virodh main 1953 main kashmir jate hue ek kashmiri jail main praan tyaage the
 An even bigger setback for the PDP is that the BJP won the maximum 23 percent votes in the state, while its share was 22
 6 pratishat vot aae
 The National Conference won just 15 seats but 20
 7 pratishat vot le gai
 Congress won 12 seats but got 6 votes
 8 pratishat hi mili
 Of course, the BJP has got most of the votes from Jammu region, while other parties have penetration in all three regions

 In Beerwah, the outgoing Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah of the National Conference defeated Congress's Nazir Ahmed Khan by just 910 votes
 in 17 siton main se 11 par pidipi kii haar hui
 The PDP lost the 18th seat by 2,189 votes

 When the MP from Udhampur, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Jitendra Singh, announced the removal of the clause giving special status to the state in the constitution, party candidate Hina Bhat from Amirakadal in Srinagar threatened to carry an AK-47 rifle

 Experts in Srinagar believe that the PDP did not really show itself apart from the BJP
 2003 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ne jammu-kashmir main algaavvaadi netaaon ke saath inasaaniyat ke daayre main baat karne kaa jo elaan kiya tha, use pidipi ne badi shiddat se yaad kiya or modi kii bijepi se rishton ko lekar apane kaaryakartaaon ko uljhan main daal diya
 In Srinagar, there was no attempt to suppress the rumors that Modi had called Mufti Sahab on the phone immediately after becoming Prime Minister

 The government exempted the French company from giving bank guarantees on the Rafale deal
 isaki jagah ‘letters of comfort’ se kaam chalaa liya gaya
 Due to this, the price of Rafale deal increased further
 ‘da hindu’ akhbaar ne apni ek report main yah daawa kiya he
 According to the newspaper, the seven-member Indian team (INT) negotiating the deal had reported in its report to the Ministry of Defense on July 21, 2016, that the cost of waiver of bank guarantee was 57
 4 karod euro tak hogi
 This led to 7 for 36 flyaway aircraft on 23 September 2016

 Para 21, 22 and 23 of this report give details of how the cost of abolishing bank guarantee 57
 4 karod euro tak hoti he
 The figure was determined on the basis of the bank's annual commission of 2 per cent, the Indian bank's confirmation charge, which was reported by SBI on 2 March 2016

 But in the final final report of INT, silence has been taken in this matter what will be the commercial impact of not getting bank guarantee
 supreme court ko di apni report main sarkaar ne kaha he ki rafel sauda iske pehle ke mmrsie kharid prakriya se ‘behatar sharton’ par hua he
 According to the newspaper, the Cabinet Committee on Security gave relief to the French company from the need for a bank guarantee and instead accepted only the 'letter of Comfort' of the French Prime Minister, which is legally binding
