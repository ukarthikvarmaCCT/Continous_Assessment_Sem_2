 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that Pakistan has become very isolated after the Airstrike
 pakistan duniya ke saamne expoj hua he
 It was easy for Pakistan to kill the Airstrike and hide it, because if he had accepted it in front of the world, he would have to pay a heavy price
 ajtak dwaara yojit vishesh 'suraksha sabha' ko sambodhit karte hue jetali ne yah baat kahi
 He said, 'what will be the greater cost of airstrike for Pakistan that countries like China and Turkey are neutral
 islamic deshon kaa sanghathan oisi bhi aapaki baat nahin sun rahaa
 'he said,' When we did strike, we did not tell the world, the first information to the world at 4 in the morning
 45 par unki fouj ne di
 There were two reasons for this
 ye spasht he ki vahaan kii sarkaar ko sena chalaa rahi he, pakistani sena ne jinhone apana aura kuch deshon main banaaya tha ki pakistan kii seemaa bahut majboot he, lekin in ghatnaon ke sach se unka aura nasht ho jaataa, agar ve sweekaar kar lete ki sargical strike main bhartiya fouj ne unke ghar main ghuskar aatankiyon ke thikaane nasht kar die
 In Airstrike, foreign aircraft entered their home and took action and if they could not do anything, then what would have happened to them
 'duniya main ghir jaataa pakistanunhone kaha, 'agar paak sweekaar kar letaa ki ye ghatana hui he to international community bahut sawaal puuchhati ki kahaan hua? vahaan kya ho rahaa tha? jo mare ve koun the? ve kya jawaab dete? ye koi jangal ke andar tent main chalane vaala camp to nahin tha
 These were institutional camps like Army, Military
 satellite ke madhyam se hamen sab pataa tha
 What they tell the world that we have Jaish Kamps running and India's army came and destroyed it with an air missile attack
 to sabase sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad pratibandh lagaataa, uske efeetief bhi pratibandh laga detii
 So it was easier for Pakistan to kill and hide it and accept it, it would have cost them a lot
 bharat duniya kaa ek taqatvar desh he
 On the other hand, Pakistan has gone to the IMF for the 13th time to help me
 'jetali ne kaha, 'aaj china ke saath aarthik, kootnithik sambandh bad rahe hai
 We are also trying to settle the boundary dispute with him
 bangladesh main kabhi aatankwaadiyon ko prashray miltaa tha aaj vah hamaara mitra desh ban chukaa he
 The situation has also changed with the Maldives
 pakistan se hamaare sambandhon main yah mahatvapurn mode aayaa he

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav 2017 ke matdaan ko bahut kam din rah gaye hai
 Strong leaders of both BJP and Congress are coming to campaign in Gujarat
 aise main ek ke baad ek vivaadit bayaan saamne aa rahe hai
 Bollywood actor and MP Paresh Rawal got caught in a controversy while addressing a gathering in Rajkot on Saturday
 haalanki unhone turant vivaadit bayaan kaa rukh duusari taraf mode diya
 Addressing the gathering at the inauguration of the bjp's election office on Saturday evening on Ring Road, Rajkot, MP Paresh Rawal said something, for which he had to immediately press conference and change the statement
 paresh rawal ne bhaashan ke dauransaradaar patelka zikr kiya
 Rawal said that i am talking about Sardar Patel because i played the role of Sardar Patel
 maine unke haavbhaav kaa abhyaas kiya tha, bahut sari jaankaree lee thi
 i had learned a lot about Sardar Patel
 aise main yah brahman kaa betaa jitna jaanata he, utana patel kaa betaa bhi nahin jaanata hoga
 Paresh Rawalne said that what i am going to say right now is for those who insult Sardar Patel
 aapako bataa duun ki patle ko apamaanit karne main congress waalon ne koi kami nahin rakhi he
 Nothing is lacking in doing injustice
 raja-rajvaade ko lekar vivaadit bayaanparesh ke bhaashan kaa vivaadit hissaa iske baad aayaa
 Paresh Rawal further said that Patel had united the country
 ye raja- rajavaade, jo bandar the, unako sahi kiya tha, sidhaa kiya tha
 Not much was written about Patel, while JRD Tata also said that had Sardar Patel been his prime minister, where would the country have reached? rawal ne aage kaha ki sardaar patel kaa apmaan karne vaale ke paas sardaar patel kaa binar nahin he
 The same Congress gave him the Bharat Ratna 30 years after the death of Sardar Patel, while it was given soon after the death of Rajiv Gandhi
 virodh shuru huasaansad paresh rawal ke is vivaadit bayaan se rajkot ke kshatriya samudaay virodh main utar aae
 He was announced to burn effigies of Paresh Rawal
 soshal media par bhi paresh rawal kaa virodh shuru ho gaya
 Reversing the statement, seeing the apology growing, the BJP had to immediately call a press conference and change the statement from Paresh Rawal
 saansad paresh rawal ne maafee maangate huai kaha ki yah jo baat maine baat kahi he, vah hyderabad ke nizaam ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kahi he
 The Rajputs have not said
 rajput to hamaare desh ke gaurav hai
 Rajpujas like Krishna Kumar Gohel, who climbed up and supported Patel
 paresh ne aage kaha ki aise logon ke liye or aisi kaum ke liye hamaare munh se aise shabd kabhi nahin niklenge
 That's all i have to say, even if someone's heart is hurt, i am a heart lover

 Jhatkamanjhi's party fought Lok Sabha elections for Mahagathbandhan with Hindustan Awam Morcha alone to contest elections; Former Chief Minister of Harbihar and National President of Hindustani Awam Morcha Jitan Ram Manjhi lashed out at leaders of Mahagathbandhan and NDA on Friday It rained
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki in donon gathbandhanon ne unhen hameshaa thaga he
 During this, Manjhi also announced that his party will field itself on its own in the next year's assembly elections in Bihar
 darasal, bihar main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jithan ram maanjhi apni party kaa vistaar karne main lage hue hai
 In this episode, on Friday, he started the membership campaign of the party in Patna
 saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jithan ram maanjhi kii party hindustani awam morcha ne mahagathbandhan ke saath milakar 3 seat par chunaav ladaa tha
 However, he did not win a single seat
 mahagathbandhan main argedy or congress se jithan ram maanjhi kii naaraazgi seat bantwaare ke samay hi jagajaahir ho gai thi
 He claimed to contest 5 seats, but his party was given only 3 seats
 maanjhi ke saal 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akele ladane ke elaan ke baad yah baat spasht ho gai he ki bihar main mahagathbandhan ke upar ek baar phir se sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Grand Alliance fielded candidates for 40 seats in Bihar
 inamen use sirf ek seat par jeet hasil hui thi
 In such a situation, the announcement of Jeetan Ram Manjhi to contest alone before the next assembly elections is a big blow to the grand alliance
 mahagathbandhan loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar ke sadame se abhi ubar bhi nahin paaya tha or maanjhi ne use doosraa jhatka de diya
 Manjhi alleged that along with the grand alliance, the NDA has cheated him
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan maanjhi endie main shaamil hue the, magar kuch hi samay ke baad unhone endie kaa saath chhodkar mahagathbandhan kaa daaman tham liya tha

 The fierce debate started on whether the alleged man-eating tigress was targeted by the Supreme Court's guidelines after the Maharashtra forest department killed a tigress named Avni on the night of November 2
 is ghatana se kshubdh najar aa rahi kendriya mahila evam bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ne iske liye maharashtra ke van mantri sudhir mungantiwar ko jimmedaar thaharaaya or kaha, ''yah hatya he
 While there, Mungantiwar hit back at Gandhi and said that she was forming her opinion on the basis of insufficient information
 udhar, baghin kii maut ke khilaaf vanyajeev kaaryakartaaon sahit anya log bhi pradarshan par utar aae
 Incredibly the state forest department had failed to catch Avni (T-1) during the last two years despite deployment of around 200 vehicles, paragliders, 104 trap cameras, four elephants and two Italian spy dogs
 yahaan tak ki usne achook nishanebaajon shafaat ali khan or unke bete asagar kii bhi sevaayen le rakhi thim
 Following reports that Avni killed 13 people during June 2016 to August 2018 and some of them ate limbs, the state's Chief Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) A

 On September 4, Mishra ordered that the tigress be killed if it is not possible to faint her safely
 ise baagh sangrakshan se jude jeril banaait ne chunauti di, lekin supreme court ne rajya van vibhaag ke aagrah par mishra ke aadesh ko kaayam rakhaa
 Mungantiwar claimed that when the tigress attacked the forest department team after failing to make her unconscious, Asghar fired only one bullet at her
 lekin shav pareekshan se pataa chalaa ki behosh karne ke liye daaga gaya dart uski twachaa ko bhed bhi nahin paaya tha
 But this gives the basis for alleging that after killing the tigress, he was later darted to make a lip-granddaughter
 shav pareekshan se yah bhi pataa chalaa ki avani ne kam se kam chaar-paanch dinon se koi shikaar nahin kiya tha yaa kuch khaaya nahin tha
 The tigress weighing 119 kg died due to excessive bleeding and failure of respiratory system
 use uske dhad ke neeche bain ore goli daagi gai jisane uske kandhe ko bhedakar uske fefdon ko nuksaan pahunchaa diya
 While Avani was killed by wildlife lovers in Mumbai on November 11, residents of villages near the Yavatmal forests celebrated it
 vasantrao nike sheti swaavlamban mishan naamak rajya stareey nigam ke pramukh or krishi kaaryakarta kishor tiwari menka gandhi par kshetra ke adivaasiyon ke hiton kaa virodh karne kaa aarope lagaate hai
 The Union Minister has raised this issue to help his spiritual mentor Prem Sai, who wants a BJP ticket from Yavatmal
 is bich, mungantiwar ne yah pataa lagane ke liye ek visheshgy samiti kaa gathan kiya he ki avani ko maarane main maanak prakriya kaa paalan kiya gaya tha yaa nahin
 Defending his minister, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected the demand for Mungantiwar's resignation
 lekin raajnneetik paryvekshak kehete hai ki darasal fadavis ko mungantiwar ko kinare lagane kaa ek mauka mil gaya he
 Mungantiwar is considered close to central Nitin Gadkari and is brightening his image as the future leader of Maharashtra

 lok janashakti party ke netaa chiraag paswan ne kaha he ki narendra modi sampradayik netaa nahin hai
 In Aaj Tak's program Sidhi Baat, he sided with Modi and said that he is doing politics of development
 chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'hakeekat yah he ki endie se gathjod hamaari majaburi ban gai
 This alliance will prove to be not only helplessness but also the strength of our party, because we tried hard to stay in the UPA
 do baar soniyaji se mili
 Rahul Gandhi has not even met us
 iske baad hamen ek majboot vikalp kii jarurat thi, jo hamen bijepi main dikhaa'
 On the question as to what is the helplessness of political principles, Chirag Paswan said, 'we have not compromised on principles to join NDA
 hamaara yah gathbandhan puri tarah muddon par aadhaarit he
 Even 12 years ago, when we were part of the NDA, we kept our principles
 'yah sawaal puche jane par ki congress ke tarjeeh na dene par endie se gathjod kya mauqaaparasti nahin he, iske jawaab main chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'ye katai maukaparasti nahin he
 All the senior leaders of Lok Janshakti Party felt that Congress is insulting us by ignoring our party
 iske baad hi hamane bijepi ko ek majboot vikalp ke taur par chunaa
 On the question that Ram Vilas Paswan has always considered BJP as a riot party, but in the greed of power, Ram Vilas Paswan has joined BJP, Chirag Paswan said, "this alliance is based not on power but on issues
" 
 hamane endie se judane ke baad bhi daliton, alpsankhyakon se jude muddon, bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene or yuva kamishan jaise masalon ko choda nahin he
 All our issues will be included in the manifesto of NDA under the Common Minimum Program
 ''bayaan paristhiti ke aadhaar par hote hai'ye puche jane par ki kabhi lok janashakti party adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ne bijepi ko 'bharat jalaao party' pukaara, to kabhi yah bayaan diya ki aresas ke dabaav main bijepi ne narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya
 In response to the fact that his party is not keeping the principles in alliance with the BJP, Chirag Paswan said, 'the statements are always given on the basis of circumstances
 halaat badalane par bayaan badal bhi sakate hai
 If we were to compromise the principles, then we would not have parted with the NDA after the riots in 2002, nor would have failed to form a government in Bihar in 2005, because at that time we demanded that the Chief Minister of Bihar should be a minority
 'chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'jab tak gujarat dangon ke maamle main supreme court ne narendra modi ko clinit nahin di thi, tab tak ham upie ke saath bane rahanaa chaahate the
 But the Congress was not giving any importance to our party
 kabhi congress kahati thi ki wo bihar kii sabhi chalis loksabhaa siton se chunaav ladegi, to kabhi kah rahi thi ki wo lok janashakti party ko bihar main do yaa teen seat degi
 This was an insult to us
 'modi communal hai yaa secularchirag paswan narendra modi ko communal maanate hai yaa secular, iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki modi filhal sampradayik nahin, balki vikaas kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 What can be a bigger secular thing that BJP President Rajnath Singh has also apologized to Muslims
 jab chiraag paswan ko yah yaad dilaayaa gaya ki unki party ke adhyaksh ne 2002 main modi ke istife kii maang kii thi, to iske jawaab main chiraag paswan kaa kahana tha ki 2002 main jo hua wo bahut bura tha, lekin hamen vaqt ke saath chalate hue aage badhanaa hoga
 On the question whether Chirag Paswan is influenced by Narendra Modi, Chirag said, 'the youth of the whole country is influenced by Modi, because Modi is talking about development only and only

 rajdhani dilli main chal rahe hukka baar ko lekar The National Green Tribunal (NGT) ne guuruuvaar ko bada aadesh diya he
 The court rejected the plea for the closure of hookah bar in Delhi, saying that hookah bar cannot be included in the polluting factors under the NGT Act as it does not cause pollution in the environment but it is in closed room Is the thing to be known
 haalanki dilli sarkaar ne pichley saal kai hukka baar ko band karaayaa tha, lekin phir bhi dilli main saikadon hukka baar abhi bhi chal rahe hai
 The court's decision for such a hookah bar is a relief
 is yachika ke khaarij hone or engiti kii ore se hukka ko engiti act main pradooshan failaane vaali chizon main shaamil nahin kiye jane ke baad pradooshan ke naam par ab rajdhani main philhal hukka baar ko band karnaa behad mushkil hoga
 However, the NGT, while rejecting the petition, also directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests to examine the effects of hookah in the context of indoor air pollution and set appropriate standards on the issue i
e
 the hookah bar may not be included in the NGT Act today
 But in future it can be changed based on the investigation report
 engiti ne yah bhi kaha ki shahar main restra or baron main hukka ke istemaal rokna uske nyaayakshetra main nahin he
 Apart from this, the NGT also said that the court would also like to advise the Ministry of Environment and Forests to consider the effects of hookah in the context of domestic air pollution

 This petition mainly said that the people who come to drink hookah have to unnecessarily pass passive smoking to the people in the restaurant and their health is affected by the smoke of hookah

 96 lakh hectare ho gai
 Obviously, if sowing is high, then yields will also be high
 aankade bhi is ore ishaara karte hai
 The yield was more than seven lakh quintals in 2010, which increased to eight lakh quintals in 2011
 2012 main to kareeb 24 lakh quintal tak guar paidaa hone kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Had there been another crop, these days there is no place to set foot in the mandis, but it is the guar, which is lying in the closets of most farmers, and they do not seem to be in the mood to take it out at the moment
 uhapoh kii aisi sthiti ban gai he, jiske bare main kuch saal pehle tak sochna bhi mumkin na tha
 Last year's prices are showing the path to farmers, which was earlier considered to be limited to traders, that is, stocking to increase demand and prices in the market
 fark itnaa he ki is baar kisaanon ne vyapaariyon kii takanic apana lee he or yahi anokhi baat he
 As Kaluram Sirav of Fakirwali in Padampur tehsil points out, "I have 80 quintals of guar
" hamane apane gharon ke jevar tak girvee rakhe hue hai, par guar ko rakhane ke liye maine boriyaan kharidin or unamem bharkar rakh diya
 "they say that in the same day last year, working class people bought 28 bikes in cash in their lonely village in Dhanteras, this was Guar's magic
" ganganagar tehsil main 7 vaai gaanv ke gurpal singh to pichley saal kaa guar bhi apane paas rakhe hue hai
 Then he bought 15 quintal guar 15,000
 ke bhav par bechaa tha
 Later the prices were doubled, even then he did not sell it in the hope of further increase
 ab unke paas kareeb sava sau quintal kaa bhandar he
 He says with comfort, "the new mustard crop has arrived
" rupye-paise kii jarurat usase puri ho jaaegi, to phir jaldi bhi kya he, padaa rahegaa
 "mango farmers feel that a section of traders and guargam entrepreneurs are trying to trick them this time so that after coming to the mandis from the fields, the prices of guar will increase and the traders take advantage of it
" sar choturam smarak samiti se jude gurbalapal singh sandhu ko is tarah kii kai misaalen yaad hai
 They state that the market price of American cotton last year was Rs 3,800
 tha
 When the farmers stopped with themselves, the price was Rs 3,500
 ve bataate hai ki isi tarah kisaanon ne apana gehun 1,200 ru
 Sold at a price of Rs
 1,800 and ten days after going to the traders, the price was Rs
 1,800
 quintal ho gaya
 The same happened in Guar
 zyaadaatar kisaanon kaa guar saste main bika, lekin usee ko vyapaariyon ne 32,000 ru
 Selling profusely to sell vaise guar ko neshnal cammdity and derevatives exange li
 (NCDX) means that its prices had increased so much by being included in the futures business, but now when the harvest was about to come, guar was thrown out of it and its prices came down drastically
 sandhu poochhate hai, ''jau, chanaa, sarson, aalu sab encidiex main hai to guar kyon nahin? vaayada kaarobaar ayog kendrreey vaanijya mantralay ko isaki sifarish bhi kar chukaa he or guar ko shaamil karne se aam upbhog kii vastuon par koi asar nahin padataa, kisaanon ko acchhee keemat ke saath sarkaar kii videshi mudra kii aay bhi badhegi kyonki guar se banane vaale guaragam kii khapat sabase zyada videshon main hi he
 Why this inadvertence? Many people like Sandhu and Kaluram Sirav were quite surprised at an event last December
 choturam smarak samiti ne guar ko encidiex main shaamil karne kii maang ko lekar jodhpur main pradarshan kaa elaan kiya, to pradarshan se thik ek din pehle kuch companiyon ne yahaan ke akhabaaron main bade-bade vigyaapan dekar use naakaam banane kii koshish kii
 Overall, the language of the advertisement was such that in the US and other countries, guar substitutes are being used and this has reduced the demand for guar
 aise main guar kaa upyog sirf tel or gas udyogon ke liye rah jayega or vah maang is saal badi hui upaj ko khapa nahin sakegi
 Sandhu says, "this propaganda of companies was only to create panic among the farmers, but if the farmers were not affected by that propaganda, then other tactics are being adopted
" ''krishi vipanan mahakme ke kshetreey up nideshak tii
 R
 meena maanate hai ki abhi bhi kisaan sara guar mandiyon main laane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 According to him, these days four to five thousand sacks are coming in the market of Ganganagar and it is not special in view of the yield
 mahakme se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, 2010-11 main jile kii tamaam mandiyon main aae kareeb 7 lakh quintal guar main se zyaadaatar kii aavak farvari tak ho chuki thi
 The same situation continued in 2011-12
 is baar paidaavaar zyada he, to bhi farvari tak sirf kareeb saadhe paanch lakh quintal guar hi mandiyon main bikne ke liye aayaa tha
 However, businessman Hanuman Goyal says, "to clear once the loan of Village Service Cooperative Societies and Banks in March, farmers will have to extract more guar, even if the price is Rs 10,000
 prati quintal hi rahen
 According to Goyal, farmers have accepted that prices will not reach the same level as last year, nor will it be included in the futures trade, but it seems that farmers have left no stone unturned in the last chance
 have taken
 ab sabhi kii nigahen sar choturam smarak samiti kii ore se 25 march ko ganganagar main prastaavit colectrate gheraav kii ore lagi hai
 The main demand is to include guar in futures trading
 is kaarykram kii kamyaabi yaa naakaami guar kii paidaavaar vaale ilaakon main badale hue paridrishy par kaaphi asar daal sakati he

 haalanki donon kii baatcheet ab tak final nahin ho saki he
 Manish Sisodia said that the birth of the Aam Aadmi Party was fighting the corruption of the Congress, but considering the way the pair of Modi and Amit Shah poses a threat to democracy, AAP has considered the alliance

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The Mayor of Jaipur was finally removed by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in the case of cows dying in Hingonia Gaushala, Jaipur
 hingonia gaushala main hajaaron gaayon ke marane ke maamle main jaanch cameti ne meyar nirmal nahata ko doshi mana tha
 On 13 December, celebrating the third anniversary of his government, Vasundhara Raje announced the removal of the Jaipur mayor
 bijepi ke pradendhyaksh ashok paranami kii taraf se kaha gaya ki jaipur meyar nirmal nahata ne vyaktigat kaarnon se meyar pad chhodane kaa faisla kiya he
 In fact, when the plight of 'aaj Tak' Nehingonia Gaushala was shown how thousands of cows have been dying of hunger and thirst and trapped in the marsh for many months, the pressure to remove the bjp's Jaipur mayor is both the Modi government and the Vasundhara government at the Center Was on kyonki hingonia gaushala kii jimmdari jaipur nagar nigam kii hi thi
 The inquiry committee admitted that Nahata was negligent but then BJP state president Ashore Parnami, close to Vasundhara Raje and Rajpal Singh, the minister of the department, convinced Vasundhara that the mayor was not at fault
 tab vasundhara raaje ne ek jaanch cameti gathit kii thi
 According to the report of the committee, Mayor Nirmal Nahata has been considered negligent and it has also been said that the villages were dying despite the information of the Mayor
 meyar ko is baat ke liye bhi doshi mana gaya he ki teen maheene se hadtaal kii vajah se halaat bigadane ke baavjood mukhyamantri yaa mantri ko is maamle kii jaankaree nahin di thi
 The opposition raised many questions, however, the opposition says why the government took so long
 hingonia kii khabar agast ke duusare saptaah main ai thi or ab chaar maheene baad meyar ko kyon hataa rahi hai? lekin logon main charchaa kaa vishay he ki vasundhara raaje ne apni teesri varshganth kaa jashn manaate hue iskaa elaan kyon kiya he? haalanki sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki meyar or jaipur nagar nigam se pehle hi hingonia gaushala kaa charge lekar nijee haathon main akshay paatr ko de diya gaya tha
 And the report of the inquiry committee was awaited
 gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko hi is vibhaag ke shahari vikaas mantri raajapaal singh kaa bhi vibhaag badla gaya he or gopaalan vibhaag krishi mantri prabhulaal saini se chhina he
 In fact, it was becoming difficult for the cow talking BJP to go public and the party received feedback from the activists that the suspension of four officers in the name of government action and not taking any major action on the culprits Wrong message
 philhal bijepi ne apane sabhi parshadon ko sitapura ke ek nijee hotel main band kar diya he, jahaan se subah 10 baje sidhe jaipur nagar nigam main laakar nae meyar kaa chunaav kiya jayega

 Kaushik Basu, the chief economic adviser of the finance ministry, is embroiled in a new controversy
 is baar hangaamaa unke ek bayaan ko lekar he
 Kaushik Basu, who arrived in Delhi to participate in a program, was asked what the government was doing to pursue the economic reform plan



 
 
 'hamen aarthik sudhaar ke kuch prastaavon par aage badhanaa hoga lekin iske raste main sabase bada roda gathbandhan upie se jude raajnneetik dal hai
 We must prepare these parties to support proposals for economic reform
 kowshik basu kaa yah bayaan upie ke samarthak dalon ko raas nahin aayaa he
 Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh told NDTV that Kaushik Basu has become accustomed to plunging the morale of the country
 piem koshish karen ki koi bhi naukarshah anaap−shanaap bayaan na den
 Mohan Singh said that the Samajwadi Party will decide to give its support only after taking into account the merits of different proposals for economic reform and the SP will not blindly support the policies of the UPA

 Kaushik Basu's statement may be upset with the politicians but it would not be wrong to say that UPA-2 has failed to carry forward the agenda of long-pending economic reforms to which opposition is not only from outside the UPA but inside the UPA Due to opposition from Mamata, it is also difficult to move forward the reform agenda

 'we have to move forward on some proposals for economic reform but the biggest obstacle in this way is the political parties associated with the UPA

 On the other hand, the opposition is also concerned about the claim of Kaushik Basu, in which he said that it will take at least four more months to recover the economic situation in the country
 tippaniyan BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi alleged that the UPA government has been repeatedly claiming to improve the situation for the last seven years but the common people have not been given any relief so far, according to CPI MP d Raja, UPA government implements such economic policies
 Is doing so that ordinary people are not getting any benefit

 Senior Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh attacked the central government for not accepting the demand for a 2-G spectrum allocation case from the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)
 singh ne congress saansadon ke is nirnay ko majaak qaraar diya ki jin dinon main sansad main kaam thap rahaa un dinon ke bhatte nahin liye jaaenge
 Speaking to reporters, he said, 'this pretense of not taking daily allowances is a big joke with parliamentary democracy
 kaam kii paribhaasha kya he
 mps do not work on the basis of muster rolls
 ’party pramukh lalu prasad ne kaha, ‘jepisi mini-sansad kii tarah he
 Why is the central government running away from JPC jepisi kii maang na maanakar unhone sabit kar diya he ki sansadeey pranali main unka koi vishwaas nahin he

 The Congress government has kept an eye on the largest vote bank in Delhi, which has been wooing for the last five years only after hearing the sound of regularization
 lekin ham jo khulaasa karne ja rahe hai use dekh kar yahi dar lagata he kahin ek baar phir colony pakki hone kii ummid lagaae baithe lakhon dilli waalon ke haath khaali to nahin rah jaaenge
 Delhi Aaj Tak has an audit memorandum of CAG
 isamen kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase hai
 The way to the throne of Delhi leads only to the thick lanes of colonies left behind in the pace of development
 sarkaar ko ye baat acchhee tarah maaloom he ki agar is vot bank ko pakkaa kar liya to chunaavon main baaji maar lee
 Therefore, just before the last elections, the RWA representatives of these colonies were given provisional certificates in the hands of UPA President Sonia Gandhi
 magar tabase lekar abtak sarkaar ne jo kuch kiya unheen kagajaton ke dam par ab sieji ne niyamit karne kii puri prakriya par hi sawaal khadey kar die hai
 In regularizing colonies, the Supreme Court's orders have been questioned in the name of the Provisional Certificate without any recognition
 jab is report kii exclusive jaankaree dilli ajtak ko mili to hamane is masale se jude mantri se bhi puure maamle kii tasdik kar lee
 Now the minister may consider it as mild but according to the information received by Delhi Aaj Tak, the CAG has blown out the government's claims on ten points
 ek ek kar ham bataate hai wo tamaam pahalu jisapar sieji ne sarkaar ko gheraa he
 Case number one - Government disregarded Supreme Court orders
 Case number two - Provision was made in the name of provisional certificate, case number 3 - Regularization was not completed within a year of giving certificate
 Case number 4- Colonies without verification of revenue department Boundary set: case number 5- There were mistakes in fixing the boundary; number 6 - rigging in fixing the boundary
 In making specific plans MCD delay had examined Kimamla number 8- Regulraijeshn the individual has not claimed a record of applications Gimamla number 9 RWA allow different departments applications Gyamamla number 10 RWA for
 yani agar is maamle kii tah main bhi nahin jaaen to sirf or sirf in binduon main hi sarkaar kii kalai khul rahi he
 Opposition is also besieging the government over this
 sieji ne apni report main ye bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar se usne jitani filein maangi wo sabhi muhaiyaa nahin karai gayi
 Even the government is avoiding giving information about how much money has been spent in these colonies till now
 kachi coloniyon main fareb kaa ye pakkaa khel yaheen khatm nahin hota
 The CAG has pointed out more irregularities in government work
 kahin colony ko niyamit karne ke liye aabaadi badha di gai to kahin khaali jameen ko bhi colony ke nakshe main shaamil kar liya gaya
 The CAG report is nine pages, detailing several flaws
 sieji ne kaha he ki vibhaag ne hazaron karod to coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke naam par laga die magar uskaa hisaab nahin de rahe hai
 The CAG has also given an example of several colonies in its report, how two figures have been given in the government files from the population to the map about the same colony
 kachi coloniyon ke naam par dilli main kaisaa khel chal rahaa he ye jaanakar aap chaunk jaaenge
 Can there be two different figures of population in the same colony on the same date, no
 
 
 lekin dilli kii anadhikrut coloniyon main ek nahin balki kai maamalon main aisa hua he
 An example in the CAG report is that where the settlement was less than 25 per cent, but it was reduced to 81 per cent for regularization in government files
 isi tarah zamin kii herapheri kaa maamla bhi sarkari filon main ujagar hua he
 Of the 28 files given by the government, the CAG did not get the maps in 16 files
 12 coloniyon ke nakshe aise mili jahaan khaali zameenon ko bhi colony main mila liya gaya
 Despite such disturbances, the government is still pursuing work in the colonies
 regularigeshan ke niyamon ke hisaab se jin coloniyon main sarkaar kii zamin aati he vahaan un vibhaagon se manjuuri lenaa jaruri he
 But the CAG report clearly states that the land of agencies like DDA, Jal Board, Railways have also been regularized without asking
 iske alaava report main sarkaar ke andar kii baghawat kaa bhi zikr he jisamen kaha gaya he ki alag-alag zilon ko dipti kamishnar ne bhi saaf taur par coloniyon ko main hui galatiyon ko sudhaarney se manaa kar diya
 Not only the government, but the MCD has also been pulled in this report for late
 sieji kii ye report us samay saamne ai he jab chunaav sir par hai
 In such a situation there will be a ruckus and in such a situation, the government may have to answer on the confusion of the colonies
 khaas taur par jab ye sawaal sieji ne uthaae hai

 Team India's second opener Shikhar Dhawan continues to be in poor form
 ajinkya rahane ko tisare or viraat kohli ko chauthe number par ran banane honge, taaki madhyakram par dabaav naa bane
 In the absence of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, the pressure of scoring fast runs in the last over will be on captain MS Dhoni

 Another defeat will make it very difficult for India to return to the series

 unka sabase bada agenda big-3 model khatm karne kaa tha
 He has been of the opinion that every country should get an equal share in ICC earnings
 tippaniyan BCCI suffered more from internal clutter than Shashank Manohar
 lambii adalati ladaai ke baad supreme court dwaara niyukt justise lodha cameti ne bisisiai main sudhaar ke liye kai suzav die, lekin ise ab bhi puri tarah lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The BCCI is currently overseen by the COA, the committee of administrators
 isamen bharat ke purv CAG vinod raay, purv mahila cricketer dyna edulaji, cricket lekhak ramchandra guha or IDFC bank ke managing diarector vikram limaye shaamil hai
 Due to lack of time and experience, this committee in the ICC could not turn member countries on the Big-3 revenue model
 haalanki iskaa sidhe isamen koi role nahin tha
 With the removal of the Big-3 revenue model, India's income has come down from 3,660 crore to about 1,860 crore
 zaahir he bisisiai ko jald hi apana ghar durust karne kii zarurat he
 Otherwise, difficulties may increase in the time to come
 shashaank manohar se zyada bisisiai ko andruni avyavashtha kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 After a long court battle, the Justice Lodha Committee appointed by the Supreme Court made several suggestions for reforming the BCCI, but it has still not been fully implemented
 filhal bisisiai kaa kaamkaaj COA yani prashaskon kii samiti dekh rahi he
 This includes former India CAG Vinod Rai, former women cricketer Diana Edulji, cricket writer Ramchandra Guha and IDFC Bank Managing Director Vikram Limaye
 samay or anubhav kii kami ke kaaran isisi main ye cameti big-3 revenue model par sadsy deshon ko apane paksh main nahin mode pai
 However, there was no direct role in it
 big-3 revenue model ke hatane se bharat kii aamadani 3,660 karod se ghatakar kareeb 1,860 karod rah gai he
 Obviously, the BCCI needs to get its house repaired soon

 aam aadmi party ke netaa eches phulka ne somvaar ko punjab main akali, congress or bhaajapa main gathjod kaa aarope lagaaya he
 On Sunday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had mentioned in the Punjab public meeting that the BJP and the Akali Dal are supporting the Congress and that the money earned by the Akalis is being misused by the Akalis in the Congress campaign
 eches phulkane bataaya, '1984 main hue katleam se jude jagadish titalar ke cese sibiai court main bataa rahi he ki narendra singh pakad main nahin aa rahe hai
 Phoolka said that we have given a phone number, it was misquoted
 aaj ek akhbaar main khabar chhapi he, isamen reporter ne usee phone number par baat kii he
 Narendra Singh said that he is ready to cooperate in the CBI investigation
 usne bataaya ki sibiai ke ek adhikari mistar khan ne mujhe approach kiya tha
 He was also told about it
 'gavaah ke gaayab hone par sawaal khadey karte hue phulka ne kaha ki titalar ko bachaane ke liesibiocourt main jhooth bol rahi he
 If action is taken against Tytler, the Congress will lose in Punjab
 yah gathjod kaa bada saboot he ki congress ko phayda dene ke liye modi sarkaar dabaav daalkar court main sibiai se jhooth bulavaa rahi he
 Let us tell you that cmerwind Kejriwalar is on a three-day Punjab tour from Sunday to 25 October

 One thing that is common in both South Africa and now New Zealand tour is that both times Gautam Gambhir's name is not included in the Indian team
 pehle county or phir ranjai trophy main lagaataar achche pradarshan ke baad bhi gambhir ko chayankarta baar-baar nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that what will Gambhir have to do that will bring his team back to India? Gautam Gambhir has loved cricket from the beginning to the extent, and that is why he is inside the ground or the ground
 Not buried under anyone ranon kaa ambaar lagane kii baat ho yaa phir zubaani jang kii, gambhir kahin peeche nahin rahe
 The events with Shahid Afridi and the events of the IPL with Virat Kohli will be fresh in your mind even today
 haal hi main khabaren ye bhi ai thim ki didisie ke adhikariyon or chayankartaaon ke saath gambhir kaa manmutav ho gaya he
 So, is his 'rebellious' attitude coming in the way of his selection? Gambhir scored 578 runs in Ranji Trophy, which included one century and three half-centuries
 dakshin africa daure main naa chune jane ke baad sabhi ko ummid thi ki kam se kam newzealand daure ke liye to gambhir ko zarur chunaa jaayegaa, lekin yahaan bhi haath lagi to niraashaa
 In a special conversation from today till date, Gambhir also admitted that yes, he definitely felt disappointed
 2009 main jab bharat newzealand ko unki hi dharti par pehali baar haraakar seenaa chaudaa karke ghar lautaa tha, to us jeet ke hero koi or nahin gautam gambhir hi the
 India beat New Zealand 1–0 in a 3-match series after 41 years of waiting
 vahaan kii swinging conditions or oochaal bhari pichon par gambhir ne teen test maichon main bharat kii taraf se sabase zyada 445 ran banaae the, jisamen 2 shandaar shatak or ek ardhashatak bhi shaamil tha
 Despite all this, the selectors did not give a chance to Gambhir
 in tamaam niraashaaon ke bich bhi gambhir ko ummid he ki wo jald hi team main vaapasi karenge
 Now it will be seen how India performs in New Zealand without Gautam Gambhir, who proved to be the trump card for the team in the last series

 On this pretext, all the misconceptions spread about the Sangh are also dispelled

 This speech also indicates the agenda of the Sangh and all the 36 allied organizations for the next year

 Therefore, political analysts are eyeing this speech to be organized on the foundation day of the association

 Since then the RSS celebrates Foundation Day on the day of Vijayadashami every year

 In Chhapra, JDU nominated the Legislative Council Deputy Chairman Salim Parvez as his candidate, but he suffered a heavy defeat

 is baat ko lekar kaaphi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki is baar 1 farvari ko jab vitt mantri bajet pesh karenge to vah lekhanudaan (antarim bajet) hoga yaa bijepi sarkaar parampara ko todate hue purna bajet pesh karegi
 It is being said that the NDA government will present the full budget this time, to assure that it will come back to power after winning the 2019 general election
 yah mana ja rahaa he ki is bajet main kai loklubhaavan ghoshnaaen kii ja sakati hai
 If we look at the recent tweets of the Ministry of Finance and Government of India, this is clearly visible
 aise kai twit main aagaamee ek farvari ko 'kendriya bajet' yaa 'bajet 2019' pesh karne kii baat kahi gai he, jabaki pehle aise antarim bajet ke liye zyada sweekaarya 'vot-aan-acount' (lekhanudaan) shabd kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 Even social media hashtags have # Budget2019 written
 is vajah se bani paramparagauratlab he ki aam parampara yah rahi he ki chunaav ke saal main sarkaar lekhanudaan yaa antarim bajet pesh karti rahi he
 This is a matter of morality
 jane vaali sarkaar tab tak ke kharch ke liye lekhanudaan pesh karti he or is par sansad kii ijaajat leti he, jab tak ki nai sarkaar kaa bajet nahin aata
 The government does not want to impose its policies on the incoming government
 ho saktaa he chunaav ke baad jo nai sarkaar aae use pichhali sarkaar kii nitiyaan pasand na aaen or vah ise puri tarah se palat de
 Therefore, it has become a tradition that the last budget of any government i
e
 the year of election is the interim budget and the government that comes after the election presents the full budget
 udyog jagat ko mili sanketalekin shaayad is baar sarkaar aise kisi bandhan main nahin bandhane vaali
 For the last few weeks, industry chambers, corporate world, accountants, consultants etc
 have been meeting with the government and giving their wishlist or advice on the budget and there is a feeling among the people returning from these meetings that the government is going to present the full budget in the same way
 As it has been in previous years
 usee tareeke se bajet bhaashan hoga, yani is baar bhi bajet main sarkaar logon ko tex slab main badlaav, nai skim, chhot, nai ghoshnaaon kaa tohfa de sakati he
 The head of a top industry chamber says, "the government will try to indicate that if you choose this government again, you will get what is being told
" ' to sarkaar is baar bajet main kar riyaayaton (jaise inakam tex chhot kii seemaa 5 lakh karne), utpaada shulk main badlaav, nai yojanaon or nai ghoshnaaon par jor de sakati he
 Industry Chambers say that the people of all sectors had not sent their recommendations to the government this time assuming that an interim budget would come in the election year
 lekin sarkaar kii taraf se kuch kaaphi utsaah dikhaate hue siforishein maangi gayi
 The industry was not ready for this and many industry organizations had to prepare overnight recommendations on a war footing
 iske pehle agar itihaas par gaur karen to 1991 main chandrashekhar kii sarkaar main vitt mantra rahe yashavanth sinha ne lekhanudaan main saarvajanik companiyon ke vinievesh karne jaisi badi ghoshnaa kii thi
 Not only this, while presenting the Interim Budget of the UPA Government in February 2014, then Finance Minister P

 The Delhi government had ordered the Delhi government to form a probe team under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 to investigate the CNG fitness scam, which had to investigate every aspect of the scam

 lekin jaise hi amit shah pahunche kii bheed bekaabu ho gai wo log jo apane asana par baithe the khadey ho gaye
 It came to light that Swami Ramdev had to repeatedly appeal to the people for restraint but there was no effect on the uncontrollable crowd

 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has made a big bet to help the farmers along with creating an atmosphere in favor of BJP through 'jan Ashirwad Yatra'
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri khatter ne haryana ke kareeb 10 lakh kisaanon ko vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bada tohfa diya he
 Manohar Lal Khattar announced the Lump sum Samadhan Yojana (OTS) for indebted farmers of cooperative banks during Jan Ashirwad Rath Yatra on Monday
 is yojana ke tahat karj ke byaaj or jurmaane kii kareeb 4750 karod kii raashi maaf kii jaaegi
 Before the assembly elections, the BJP is considered to be a big bet because farmers in Haryana have the power to create and spoil power
 in sahakaari bank se liye gaye karj par milegaa phaydapraathmik sahakaari krishi samitiyon, jila kendriya sahakaari bank, haryana bhoomi sudhaar evam vikaas bank ke rini kisaanon ko is yojana kaa sidhaa laabh milegaa
 Farmers' accounts were declared NPA (non Performing Assets) by these banks and farmers were not able to renew the loans, now farmers will be able to change the cycle of loan accounts after this announcement
 bataa den ki ekamusth samaadhaan yojana kaa laabh lene ke liye kisaanon ko teen maheene main sahakaari bainkon se liye gaye karj kii mul raashi jamaa karaani hogi
 The last date for repayment of principal loan has been set as 30 November 2019
 paanch hajaar karod karjamukhyamantri khatter ne ekamusth samaadhaan yojana karne ke dauraan bataaya ki praathmik krishi evam sahakaari samitiyon se lagbhag 13 lakh kisaanon ne rin le rakhe hai

 haryana bhoomi sudhaar evam vikaas bank (land morgej bank) ke 1
 There are 10 lakh indebted farmers
 in baikon ke dwaara kisaanon ne fasal ke liye karj liya he
 The amount of interest and penalty of these farmers' loans will be forgiven
 vipakshi dalon se chin liya kisaanon kaa muddahryana kii siyasat main kisaan kingmekar maane jate hai
 This is the reason why opposition parties, including the Congress, have been continuously targeting the BJP government led by Manohar Lal Khattar as an anti-farmer government
 congress kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii baat uthaati rahi he
 In such a situation, Manohar Lal Khattar, instead of completely waiving the loans of farmers, has run the gamut of waiving the interest and penalty amount
 is faisle se na keval punjab, rajasthan or madhya pradesh kii tarj par rin maafee kii maang kar rahe kisaan sanghathanon ko saadhane main madad milegi, balki vipakshi dalon se ek bada siyaasi mudda bhi bijepi ne chin liya he

 a high-profile lawyer and Congress leader immersed in a pile of legal documents in his artfully built office in a thriving capital city of Delhi, gave a very simple explanation of the party's problems — the overdose of democracy
 ve ise bhartiya loktantr kii sabase badi vidambnaa maanate hai
 "our party is the one whose leader is the leader of the lineage tradition, but he becomes highly democratic in taking decisions in an effort to please everyone and give space to everyone's talk," said this Supreme Court lawyer
 nateeja yah hota he ki ve koi faisla hi nahin kar pate
 In contrast, the BJP is a democratic party, but in it two people make all the decisions in a dictatorial manner — right or wrong — and all of them accept those decisions quietly
 yah antar hi bharat main do rashtriya partiyon kii safalataa or vifaltaa ko spasht karata he
 "like the court, they present evidence here as well
" is saal uttar pradesh chunaav se thik pehle congress ne teen maheene yah tay karne main laga die ki priyanka gandhi kahaan or kaise prachaar karengi
 Finally, after several rounds of deliberations, it was decided that she would campaign only in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 unka kahana tha, ''itnaa samay keval yah faisla karne main barabaad kar diya gaya ki ve vahi karti rahengi jo pehle se karti aa rahi hai
 "many such decisions are still awaited in the Congress
" himachal pradesh main is saal chunaav hone vaale hai
 Demand is being raised that the ailing Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, who is besieged in several corruption cases, should not be given a chance to lead the party again
 madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav agle saal hone hai or vahaan diggaj netaa kamalnath or loksabhaa main party ke mukhya vip jyotiraditya sindhiya, donon hi mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar banane kii ummid lagaae hai
 It is not yet clear who will take charge of the party in the elections in Gujarat later this year
 congress kaa rashtriya rodmap bhi kaaphi aspasht he
 Whichever leader India Today spoke to, he said that the party should first revive in the states from where popular leaders will emerge
 yah tabhi mumkin ho paaegaa jab congress kii jadon ko majboot kiya jaae
 Block and district units and booth committees should be empowered
 do saal pehle 2015 main vipashyana ke liye apane charchit avkaash se pehle congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne party ko phir se khadaa karne ke liye blue print apni maa ko saunpa tha
 That blueprint was mainly around these suggestions
 lekin vah blue print tab se dhul hi kha rahaa he
 Most leaders considered close to party president Sonia Gandhi believe that the decisions are hanging because of Rahul
 haal ke varshon main kai shaareerik takalifon se jujh raheen 70 saal kii sonia gandhi ne apane zyaadaatar adhikaar rahul ke hawaale kar die hai
 Senior party leader Digvijay Singh, once considered to be Rahul's political mentor, says that "he should take decisions
" log indira gandhi ko pyaar karte the kyonki ve nirnay leti thim
 Narendra Modi takes decisions - right, wrong or absolute
 lekin faisle nahin lene ne party ko sabase bada nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 However, there have been some decisions
 congress ke is saal goa vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa se zyada siten jeetne ke baad bhi sarkaar na bana paane ke baad goa or karnataka ke prabharee mahasachiv ke rup main digvijay singh ko pad se hataa diya gaya

 si
 Was given to Venugopal
 venugopal aksar loksabhaa main rahul ke bagal main baithe najar aa jate hai
 Rahul's most favorite Mohan Prakash has also been removed from the post of general secretary in charge of MP, which would have made Digvijay, Scindia and Kamal Nath happy
 rahul ke najdiki logon kaa yakeen kiya jaae to unke party adhyaksh banate hi kai krantikari kism ke faisle honge
 Now it is almost certain that Rahul will contest for the post of president in the Congress organizational elections to be held next month
 iske sanket unhone barkale main california uniwarsity main bhaashan main bhi de die the
 a source close to Sonia says that they are against fighting for Rahul's election for president
 unhen dar he ki koi anya bhi maidan main kud saktaa he or kahin rahul ko sharmindagi kaa saamana na karnaa pade kyonki nichle cader main rahul kii lokapriyata sandehaaspad he
 The party's Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi says that the Congress should take a hard decision about Rahul becoming president
 uske peeche chaahe jo bhi vajah hon, is kaam main ab jaraa bhi deree nahin honi chahie
 Another general secretary in-charge of many states claims that the decision making speed, process and core structure of the party will all change once Rahul takes over
 e
 People like Chellakumar and Venugopal are being given charge of the states in place of the old leaders who used to interfere in many areas earlier
 haalanki is prakriya main bhi thodi visangati dikhi he
 Mohanprakash and Madhusudan Mistry, two of Rahul's close associates, suffered the party's poor performance, while former Union Minister C
C
 pi
 Joshi still handles the entire Northeast, Bihar and West Bengal
 party assam, bihar or manipur main satta se baahar ho gai or kai netaa saath chhod gaye or joshi dekhte rahe
 Joshi says that it will not be appropriate to evaluate Rahul's performance yet
 ve kehete hai, ''sonia ne 1998 main party kaa jimmaa sambhala tha or party chah saal baad (centre main) satta main aa gai thi
 Rahul has not even started yet
 '' haalanki joshi bhul jate hai ki rahul party main faisle lene kii prakriya kaa hissaa kareeb ek dashak se hai jise ve khud bhi barkale main sweekaar kar chuke hai
 He claimed to have taken the credit of bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir and said that he had been working closely with the UPA governments even though this was in stark contrast to his stand so far in which he had been saying that he was being unfairly He has been held responsible for the decisions of the government in which he was not involved
 congress ke kai netaaon kaa kahana he ki barkale main rahul kaa bhaashan party ke punerjeevan ke liye unki yojanaon kaa khaakaa pesh karata he or unke khilaaf chalane vaale dushprachaar ke khilaaf unke badale nazariye kaa bhi sanket detaa he
 For the first time, he did not defend familyism, but described it as an integral part of Indian politics
 lekin unhone yah bhi saaf kar diya ki ve party ke sheersh pad ke liye loktantric rasta chunenge, chunaav ladgaye kaa
 It was a relief for the party veterans that they gave a clear indication that their potential core team would have a mix of youth and experience
 unhone is baat ko bhi eemaandaaree se mana ki ve yuva netaaon ke paksh main hai lekin ab sanghathan chalaane ke liye pratibhashali bujurg brigade kii jarurat he
 Many signs of this are already being found, and the most important of these is the re-emergence of Manmohan Singh who is being fielded to attack the Modi government on various issues from GDP to Kashmir
 unki ek 'anicchhuk' netaa kii chhavi banane kii 'computer par baithe 1,000 bhaajapaayiyon' kii koshishon kaa sidhaa jawaab dene kii sambhavatya apni tarah kii pehali koshish main rahul ne yusi barkale ke chaatro ko chunauti di ki ve unki yogyata kaa moolyankan unke kahe ke aadhaar par karen
 Most notably is his emerging strategy against Prime Minister Modi for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone maan liya he ki ve bhaashan dene kii kala main modi ke baraabar nahin hai
 They have also understood that attacking the pm's schemes like Make in India in the midst of nationalist outcry will have the opposite effect
 isaki bajaae unhone sarkaar par un masalon ke liye chot karne kaa faisla kar liya he jahaan use sabase zyada takalif ho—arthvyavastha or naukariyaan
 After demonetisation and GST, Rahul raised the point of employing Make in India for the benefit of small and medium enterprises
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki sarkaar rojaanaa mahaj 500 naukariyaan hi srujit kar rahi he jabaki jarurat 30,000 naukariyon kii he
 He referred to rising communal violence and intolerance
 modi se sidhi ladaai se bachate hue rahul ne ek or dushman ke khilaaf morcha khol liya—sangh
 Between the two claims of defamation leveled at them by Sangh activists, it makes sense to focus their attention on the organization
 sangh kaa rashtravyapee dhaancha hi bhaajapa ke vistaar main madadgaar rahaa he
 Digvijay says, "it is a battle of ideology and the Sangh is against the things that make India
" '' dilli ke ek netaa kaa kahana tha, ''agar ve nichle str par party ko majboot nahin banaate hai to sangh yaa bhaajapa kaa saamana karnaa to dur, dilli main 'aap' se bhi nahin lard paaenge
 Do they have any strategy for the 2019 elections? Joshi puts it in a very easy way
 pehle to 2014 ke chunaavon main acha pradarshan karne vaali partiyon ko saath main laana hoga
 He says, "the Bihar election has proved that the BJP can be defeated
" '' haalanki sapa, basapa, rajd, trinmul, vamadal, bijd or dramuk ko saath laana rahul ke liye kathin ho saktaa he
 That is why despite Rahul taking over the party, Sonia will continue to be UPA President
 philhal to rahul maidan main kudane ko taiyaar hai, unhone apane mukhya dushman kii pahchaan bhi kar lee he
 There is also a big difficulty
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kaa kahana he, ''rahul ab bhi sawaal hi kar rahe hai or koi samaadhaan nahin pesh kar rahe hai
 The learning process is already very long
 '' barkale main rahul ne kaha tha ki ve aise kai or samvaad karenge
 Perhaps they will also have to tell the people that they can offer an alternative to Modi

 renu jogi ne sonia ko bheje patr main kya likhaais bich renu jogi ke us patr ko lekar raajnneetik galiyaaron main khaasi charchaa he jo unhone congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko likhaa he
 Renu Jogi has written in a letter to Sonia that my husband and son were defamed by bringing fake cds, i kept quiet
 main do varshon se nirantar apamaanit hoti rahi lekin kabhi bhi aapako ek shabd nahi bataaya, main chup rahi
 The party always endured silently for the benefit of the party
 ek kshan ke liye bhi mujhe aisa nahin laga ki aap mere saath nahin khadi hai
 i always kept my strong allegiance to the Congress party and the Gandhi family
 unhone yah bhi likhaa ki 'maine kabhi kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki mere jivan se jude nirnay aapako bataane ke liye mujhe aapako patr likhane kii aavashyaktaa padegi
 It has been more than three decades, the relationship between us is so close that there is no wall between me and you
 maine sadaiv aapako apana adarsh mana
 There has never been any alienation in my family and yours
 ham niswaarth bhaavana se ek duusare se jude rahe
 We stood neutral to each other's interests under all circumstances, political and non-political, happiness and misery
 aapane mujhe bahut pyaar or satkar diya
 Honoring your love, i also supported you in every adverse situation
 mere pati or gandhi parivaar ke prati sarvocch nishtha rakhane vaale jogi ji jab apamaanit hokar congress se alag hue or apni nai party banaai, tab bhi maine congress or gandhi parivaar ko apane parivaar se upar rakhaa or congress party kii seva karti rahi
 In the letter, Renu Jogi wrote, "after Jogi Ji's new party was formed, his opponents targeted me to stop him and to serve his political interest
" mujhe saarvajanik jivan main pratadit kiya gaya, phir bhi main chup rahi
 Congress leaders ran a false campaign against me, i kept quiet

 Not even for a moment did i feel that you are not standing with me
 maine hameshaa congress party or gandhi parivaar ke prati apni majboot nishtha rakhi
 Never under any pressure
 apane swayan ke parivaar ke hiton ko tilanjali dekar aage badi or congress party ke liye kaam kiya lekin shaayad niyati ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 'renu Jogi wrote,' In the end, what happened was not what the Congress friendly but Jogi's opponents wanted
 jis kota vidhansabha kshetra ko maine apane parivaar kii tarah paala or seva kii, use hi mujhase aaj chin liya gaya
 My ingenuity, innocence, my renunciation and allegiance were deliberately viewed through the prism of malice, jealousy and narrow politics under a conspiracy and today there is an attempt to eradicate my existence, to bring that conspiracy to fruition
 ab tak baat mere parivaar tak simit thi lekin aaj mere kotawasiyon se mujhe dur karne kaa aniatik or anyaaypurna krity hua he
 'renu Jogi further wrote, i am extremely sorry to inform you that neither the Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Party has any discretion nor any person to test the self-respect and sacrifice of a loyal and senior women worker in the party

 No one can separate me from the quota
 maine apana shesh jivan kotawasiyon ko samarpit kar diya he
 i will contest from Kota to prove that the truth remains silent, but that does not mean that it is defeated

 My personal relationship and respect with you will always remain the same as it has been for the last three decades

 baluchistan kii aazaadee ke paksh main america main bhi chhitput awaajen uthni lagi hai
 a senior US lawmaker raised the issue on Friday, saying that the US should support the Balochists and the victims of repression in Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki ye maanavadhikaar ulanghan ke bade maamle hai or vahaan ke sthaneey log swashaasan kaa adhikaar chaahate hai
 Congress member Dana Rohrabacher said that Pakistan should remember what happened in 1971
 maanavadhikaar ulanghan or sthaneey logon par julm ke chalate hi purvi pakistan uske haath se nikal gaya, jo baad main bangladesh ke rup main janaa gaya
 Balochistan, which is rich in mineral wealth, is the largest province in Pakistan, but has a very small population
 yahaan beete kai dashak se aazaadee kii maang ko lekar vidroh ke swar uthte rahe hai
 However, the Pakistani Army has been suppressing these voices of rebellion through the use of force
 america sadan main pratinidhiyon ko sambodhit karte hue rohrabaker ne kaha ki bangladesh ke logon ne jab pakistani sarkaar se thodi aazaadee chaahi or apane jivan ko apane tareeke se niyantrit karne ke liye apni sarkaar chaahi, to is maang ko barbartapurvak dabaa diya gaya
 And as a result of this, people got up and liberated themselves as Bangladesh
 unhone kaha ki thik isi tarah kaa daman balooch logon ke saath ho rahaa he
 Not only this, this is also happening with the idiots who came to Pakistan from India after partition
 rohrabaker ne kaha ki muhajir log is bhrasht, aatank samarthak sainya shashan vaali pakistan sarkaar ke vasheebhoot nahin hona chaahate
 The American MP further said that we should stand with these people who want their freedom and believe in the same values as us
 aavashyaktaa is baat ki he ki america balooch logon kaa samarthan kare
 Rohrabaker alleged that the Baloch people are being oppressed by the Pakistanis and are being subjected to frequent killings
 unhone kaha ki ye pakistan kaa itihaas rahaa he
 Now these people are doing this with Baloch and Sindhis
 punjabiyon or anya ko chhod diya jaae to aise bahut saare samooh hai jo daman ke shikaar hai, sirf pashtunon ko chhodkar jo pakistan main sarkaar ko niyantrit karte hai
 The BJP and the Congress have given full force to win the political battle of Karnataka Assembly elections
 congress or siem siddharmaiya ne rajya ke kingmekar maane jane vaale lingayat samudaay ko alag dharm kaa darja dekar masterstroke chalaa, to vahiin bijepi bhi apane paramparaagat lingayat vot ko saadhane ke liye kii koshishon main lagi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has formulated a strategy to play Lingayat cards from London and BJP President Amit Shah from Bangalore
 12 veen sadi lingayat samudaayake darshanik or sabase bade samaaj sudhaarak basavanna kii aaj jayanti he
 The BJP does not want to let this opportunity go out of its hands under the Karnataka Assembly elections
 piem modi ne landan se twit karke kaha, main bhagwaan basavesheshwar kii jayanti ke maukey par naman karata hum
 They have a special place in our history and culture
 saamaajik sadbhaav, bhaichara, ekta or sahanubhuti par unka jor hameshaa hamen prerana detaa he
 Lord Basaveshwara united our society and gave importance to knowledge
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaamanwealth summit main shirkat karne ke liye landan pahunche hai
 Modi is trying to win the heart of the Lingayat community from the land of London
 landan ke tems nadi ke paas lingayat samudaay ke samaaj sudhaarak basavanna (unhen bhagwaan basavesheshwar bhi kaha jaataa he) kii murti par shradhanjali arpit karenge

 Neeraj Patil is the President of Basaveshwar Foundation UK
 piem modi kii is kavayad ko karnataka vidhansabha chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 In fact, the Lingayat community in Karnataka has 17 per cent of the vote
 bijepi kaa mul votbank mana jaataa rahaa he
 But the Congress had put the BJP on the backfoot by accepting their years old separate religion demand to bring them into their court
 piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah isaki bharpai karne kii koshishon main lage hai
 Amit Shah is reaching Karnataka on the occasion of the birth anniversary of social reformer Basavanna
 ve rajya main do din tak rahenge
 Shah will visit the statue of Basavanna in Bangalore
 iske baad shaam ko lingayat samudaay ke ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karenge
 The Shah Lingayat writer will garland the statue of Chidananda
 iske baad ek dalit lekhak ke saath bhi mulaakaat karenge
 The political connection of Lingayat community not only in northern India but also in the politics of the south, political politics is woven on the basis of caste and religion
 karnataka kii siyasat main lingayat samudaay king mekar maani jaati he
 The Congress has had a strong vote bank during the Lingayat era, but when the Congress government was formed in 1989, Rajiv Gandhi removed the then CM Virendra Patil from the post due to a controversy
 congress ke is kadam se lingayat samudaay main aakrosh kii bhaavana jaagi or unhone congress kaa daaman chhodkar bijepi ke ramkrishna hegade kaa samarthan kiya
 After the death of Hegde, BS Yeddyurappa became the leader of Lingayats
 yediurppa kii jariye hi bijepi ne 2008 main karnataka kii satta main ai
 Yeddyurappa was CM for just three years, but after three years, BJP removed him from the post of CM
 bijepi bhi congress kaa daanv chalaa
 When Yeddyurappa was removed, the Lingayak community also turned away from the BJP
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa ki bijepi ko 2013 haar mili
 The Lingayat community has always been taken care of in Karnataka politics
 congress ne lingayat ko apane paale main laane ke liye alag dharm kaa darja diya to bijepi ne dobaaraa se yediurppa ke chehre ko aage kiya

 According to Spotby, Salim Khan says, "this is not the first time this has happened

 And sometimes a man has his own compulsions
 mujhe abhi tak detail nahin pataa he ki priyanka ne bharat kyon chodi lekin ham jald hi kisi or ko cast kar lenge

 mid-de se baatcheet main nikhil ne kaha, "priyanka ne do din pehle hamen bataaya ki sagaai ke chalate use yah film chhodani hogi
 It was a little unprofessional of him to do it all of a sudden
 " maaloom ho ki priyanka ke jane ke baad ab mekars katrina or jacleen ke bare main vichaar kar rahe hai
