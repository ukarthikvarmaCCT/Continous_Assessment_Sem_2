 is kaaran iske tel ko zyada dinon tak rakhaa ja saktaa he or khaadya tel ke rup main iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Agricultural scientist Prabhakar Kumar Singh, a professor at Kanpur-based Chandrasekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology and a pioneer in research and testing on the new species of linseed TL-99, told IANS, "flaxseed oil has the properties that olive oil has , So this oil is beneficial in terms of health

 The battle is also such that it won on every front, won even from the Supreme Court, but unless someone says from the heart that we have a relationship with blood, then what happens with what the paper and the law says
 lekin 2 march, 2014 ko chijen achaanak badal gayi
 Actually it happened that Amma (dr
 ujjwala sharma) ko pataa chalaa ki tiwari ji (narayan dutt tiwari) ilaaj ke liye dilli ke ames aspataal main bhartee hai
 She knew that it was not right for him to go, she could also be insulted, but she went there by force
 ames pahunchin to pataa chalaa ki tiwari ji kii chuttee ho gai he lekin do taarikh ko ve uttar pradesh sadan main rahenge
 Tiwari ji's convoy was leaving when she reached the house with the desire to see the old man once again
 donon kii nazren milin
 Tiwariji respectfully asked him to sit inside and said that he comes to settle a meeting
 ammaa andar jaakar baithi or khud ko halaat ke mutabik dhaal hi raheen thi ki tiwari ji waapas aa gaye
 He did not go to the meeting and returned by the way
 jo varshon se nahin hua tha, vah us din hua or donon kii ankhen nam ho gayi
 Tiwari asked attachment, "how is Rohit?" Amma said, her health is not good
 tiwari ji kaa dil bhar aayaa
 His body was not supporting, but he immediately insisted on coming to me
 ammaa ne unhen roka or mujhe phone kar bulaayaa
 i told Rukhai that what is the use of such a meeting, are they ready to accept the truth in front of the world? Tiwari ji said, they are ready for everything
 main koi 11
 Arrived there at 30 o'clock at night, along with electronic media
 varshon baad parivaar ke is milan kii tasviren to aapane tivi par dekhi hi hai
 But after the camera was off, the three of us sat together crying for a long time
 aaj mere dil se malaal khatm ho gaya he
 Anyway, i certainly opposed Tiwari ji in court and public forums but never used such indecent language
 main aaj jitna sammaan apni maa kaa karata hum, utana hi sammaan pita kaa bhi karata hum
 May you be the mother goddess, mother goddess
 lekin is happy anding ke baavjood itane varsh kii tadwa ne mujhe bahut kuch sikhaaya he
 i remember how Tiwari used to come home on my every birthday
 unke bheje mahange-mahange tohfe mujhe kabhi nahin bhoolatey
 Rohit used to be small on his travels
 lekin usee rohit kii maa ne jab kaha ki bete ko apana naam do, to tiwari ji kaa pyaar achaanak dhundhala hone laga
 When my mustache was coming in 1995, when i was a teenager, Tiwari ji's doors were closed forever for us
 maa ne bhi dil par pathar rakh liya or mujhe meri padhai-likhaai puri karne di
 The needle of time kept spinning, but the twinge of my life did not diminish
 phir 2002 aayaa
 Tiwari became the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand
 main bhi ab 23 saal kaa jawan ho gaya tha
 i told Amma that i will go to Tiwari to ask for my rights
 main, ammaa or nani dehradun pahunche
 To this day what the grandmother said to Tiwari ji resonates in my ear, "we have come to offer prayers, not congratulations
 ” tiwari ji ne aashwaasan diya ki ve mujhe haq denge
 The same trend continued till 2005
 main dehradun jaataa
 They would pamper themselves in seclusion, but held me in the Hotel Madhuban
 kai baar aisa hua ki main 15-15 din tak dehradun main padaa rahata or ve haridwar main jame rahete
 Neither did he come here nor let me come there
 har mulaakaat ke baad meraa vishwaas pukhta hota gaya ki jo aadmi mujhe apana naam tak nahin de saktaa usase or kisi cheez kii ummid kii jaae
 In 2007 we moved to court
 isi kanoonee ladaai ke dauraan mujhe dil kaa daura bhi padaa
 It was a shock to Amma
 ek taraf unhen mukademe main jaleel hona padataa, duusari taraf jawan betaa gambhir beemaari se jujh rahaa tha
 Tiwari ji was unaware of all these things
 ve satta kii oonchi kursiyon par asin the or ham adaalat kii chaunkhat par edinan ragad rahe the
 The court gave us justice
 nyaay dene vaale nyaayadhish mujhe devdoot se kam nahin dikhte
 But words like 'badlan' and 'mistress' used for mother in legal proceedings kept tearing my heart
 aisi gaaliyaan kam se kam kanoon kii bhashaa se to nikaal di jaaen
 i have decided that i will campaign to remove such objectionable words from the court vocabulary
 iske alaava har adalati taarikh par mujhe sanni deol kaa dialog ‘taarikh par taarikh’ yaad aata rahaa
 After all, we are such a big democracy, so why is the number of courts so low? Why do judges have so many lawsuits? Why is the cost of fighting a lawsuit so high? When will we think about judicial reform? These questions will follow me
 lekin mujhe santosh is baat kaa he ki maine apni maa ko samaaj main vah sammaan dilaayaa jo 21veen sadi main har nari ko milanaa chahie
 Amma always says, "if we go away from tradition, society can accept, but if we move away from humanity, society does not accept it
" ” tiwari ji or maa ek parampara se hate the isliye main duniya main aayaa lekin tiwari ji to insaaniyat se hi hat gaye the
 Today his heart has melted
 ve maanavtaa ke raste par laut aae hai
 i also know that some people had a vested interest in causing them to wander
 lekin ab kuch roshni kii kiran dikh rahi he
 i am thankful to all those who supported Mera and Amma in their unique trial in the world
 main chahta hum ki ab koi maa is tarah ghut kar na jiye or meri tarah har santan apni maa ko uskaa haq dilaae

 tomorrow
 enditivi india ko sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki nai dilli or duusare jagahon se kathmandu jane vaale transport vimaanon kii awajahi par ab roak lag jaaegi
 Transport aircraft will be sent to Kathmandu in relief operations only when necessary
 isaki ek nahin kai vajah hai
 The biggest reason is being told that the Government of Nepal and the Nepalese Army in particular are not happy with the fact that in the Indian media only India is being shown in the relief operations and all the credit is being given to the Indian forces
 is
 nepali sena ko isse apni tathaa bharat ke alaava un anya mitra deshon kii chhavi kii chintaa sata rahi he jo rahat abhiyaan main madad de rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Nepal Army did not let any Indian journalist fly by helicopter with relief operations on Tuesday
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ab raahat saamagree lekar vayusena kaa jo bhi vimaan nepal jayega to use pehle saare ditels dene honge, masalan kya saamaan lekar aa rahaa he or usamen kya-kya shaamil he? isse pehle aisa nahi tha
 From the Palam airbase, the aircraft flew directly to the Trimbhuvan Airport in Kathmandu and did not have to provide any specific details
 tippaniyan On 27 April, two Air Force transport aircraft went to Kathmandu but were not allowed to land
 us samay isaki vajah ye bataai gai ki kathmandu main air trephic bahut zyada he
 Then an Air Force officer reached Kathmandu on Tuesday to resolve the issue and the matter is being claimed to be resolved
 par ye sab itnaa aasaan nahin lag rahaa
 Even on Wednesday, only one C-130 could fly to Kathmandu from Hindon with baby food
 iske pehle mangalvaar ko bhi keval do hi vimaan ja paae
 One of them had reached Kathmandu with relief material from Delhi and one from Bathinda
 vaise ab bharat or nepal ke bich sadak maarg bhi khul gaya he or ho saktaa he jo bhi raahat saamagree ab bharat se nepal jaae vah sadak maarg ke jariye bheji ja sakati he

 The Nepalese Army is worried about this and the image of other friendly countries besides India, who are helping in the Rahat campaign
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki nepal kii sena ne mangalvaar ko ek bhi bhartiya patrkaar ko helicopter se raahat abhiyaan ke saath udaan bharne nahin di
 It is being told that now whatever plane of the Air Force will go to Nepal with relief material, it will have to give all the details first, for example what goods are coming and what is included in it? This was not done before
 palam airbase se vimaan sidhe kathmandu ke tribhuvan airport ke liye udaan bharte the or unhen koi khaas ditels dene kii jarurat nahin padati thi
 The comments 27 april ko vayusena ke do transport vimaan kathmandu gaye the lekin unhen utarane nahi diya gaya
 At that time, the reason was stated that there is a lot of air traffic in Kathmandu
 phir is masale ko sulajhane ke liye vayusena kaa ek adhikari mangalvaar ko kathmandu pahunchaa tha or maamla sulajh jane kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 But all this does not seem so easy
 buudhvaar ko bhi dopaher tak hindon se keval ek si-130 kathmandu ke liye udaan bhar sakaa wo bhi baby food lekar
 On Tuesday, only two aircraft were able to go
 inamen ek dilli se or ek bathinda se raahat saamagree lekar kathmandu pahunchaa tha
 By the way, the road between India and Nepal has also opened and whatever relief material may now go from India to Nepal can be sent via road
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ab raahat saamagree lekar vayusena kaa jo bhi vimaan nepal jayega to use pehle saare ditels dene honge, masalan kya saamaan lekar aa rahaa he or usamen kya-kya shaamil he? isse pehle aisa nahi tha

 The neighboring country said on Monday that India's membership in the meeting in Seoul is not an issue
 china ne kaha, 'enesji ke sadsy desh abhi bhi is mudde par ekamat nahin hai
 In such a situation, talks on the entry of a new country in the group during the upcoming meeting will be childish
 ' yah baithak 24 june ko hone vaali he

 "we think India is concerned", he added, "we understand that no such topic is included in the annual conference in Seoul this year
 ham samajhate hai ki gaiyr enpiti desh enesji main apane pravesh ko lekar phikrmand hai

 ' hua ne aage kaha ki vah yah bataanaa chaahati hai ki enesji ke agenda main gaiyr enpiti deshon ke enesji main shaamil hone kaa mudda kabhi shaamil nahin rahaa
 What is the objections of China: The NSG looks at the important issues related to nuclear and its 48 members are allowed to trade and export nuclear technology

 China is opposing India's entry into the NSG
 uskaa kahana he ki bina parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) par hastakshar kiye kisi bhi desh kii is samooh main entry nahin ho sakati
 The NSG was formed in 1974 after India's first nuclear test
 iskaa lakshya tha ki duniya main bhar main parmaanu hathiyaaron ke prasar ko roka jaae
 India's NSG membership not on Seoul meet agenda: China

 According to Fotedar, just a few days before her assassination, Indira Gandhi suggested Priyanka's name as political successor
 priyankaki kushalta or swabhaav ke kaaran vah unhen raajnneetik apni uttaradhikari maanati thim
 He saw political acumen in Priyanka
 haalanki sonia gandhi ko yah baat ab tak jami nahin he
 Indira did Kashmir Referring to the last days of Dawoodirah Gandhi, Makhan Lal Fotedar said that he visited Kashmir in October 1984
 is dauraan vah hindu or muslim dharmik sthalon main gayi
 Only then did he mention this
 gauratlab he ki 30 oktober ko photedaar kii kitaab 'chinar leeves' launch ho rahi he
 In this book itself, Fotedar has made many big revelations about the Gandhi family
 photedaar ne kaha ki indira ne behad bhavuk andaaj main priyanka ke bare main charchaa shuru kii thi or 'bhavi netaa' ke taur par priyanka kii pahchaan banane kii baat kahi thi
 Both Rajiv and Sonia had told the Kshwishwarishtak Congress leader that after Indira's assassination, he had made Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi aware of this
 haalanki donon ne is par kabhi zyada gambhirtha se vichaar nahin kiya
 In his book, he will also explain the circumstances under which Sonia Gandhi had to enter politics? Tell that during the Lok Sabha elections, there was a strong demand in the Congress that Priyanka Gandhi be brought to the fore and given a place in the party

 darasal baadh ke chalate yahaan bigade halaat ko dekhte hue vibhaag ne yah faisla liya
 The National Education Policy of 1986, revised in 1992 for more than two decades, remains the central government's guideline in the field of education
 iske pehle 1968 main rashtriya shiksha niti banaai gai thi, jo aazaadee ke baad shiksha ke maamle main pehali rashtriya pahal thi
 However, during the British Raj, the Wardha Education Scheme (mahatma Gandhi's Nai Talim) drafted a "national policy" in 1938 and recommended the provincial governments to implement it
 cab (siabii) cameti kii ''yuddh ke baad bharat main shiksha ke vikaas kii yojana" par 1944 kii report (saragent plan) main shiksha ke ''bhartiyakaran," praathmik shiksha ko sabake liye sulabh banane or shiksha kii kul gunvattta ko sudhaarney par jor diya gaya tha
 Although the education policy of 1986-92 is very broad in terms of thought and concept, but it has not yielded proper results in the field of education
 tamaam tarah ke lakshyon or kaaryakramon ke baavjood desh main shiksha kaa maamla sabase lachar he
 Most of the objectives and goals have not been partially achieved
 isaki badi vajah yah he ki na koi vyaavhaarik ruparekha he or na sanchaalan sambandhi vishisht niyam-kaayade
 Moreover, with the heavy politicization at every level from the village / block itself, the scope of corruption has increased to such an extent that no aspect of education is left untouched
 pichley kareeb teen dashakon kii to yahi sabase ahm kahani he
 Education and public health are perhaps the two most important symbols of development in a democracy
 pichley dashakon kii hakeekat yahi he ki in kshetron kii ore ratti bhar bhi dhyaan nahin diya gaya he
 So today, unfortunately, the ground reality is very different from what was stated as the purpose of this policy
 skulon main or ucchtar shiksha sansthaanon donon main daakhile teji se bade hai lekin uske saath kai behad anachaahe nae maamalon main bhi ijapha hua he
 There has been an increase in basic facilities in the school system but there has not been a slight difference in the quality of education
 yahi nahin, lagaataar kai adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki schuli padhai ke nateezon main chintajanak giravat ai he
 Government schools have also failed to provide minimum quality education
 natijatan, gramin ilaakon main bhi nijee yaa ''sahaytaprapt" skool bade paimaane par khul gaye hai lekin ye bhi koi marke kaa nateeja nahin de paae hai
 There has also been a flood of private colleges and universities, most of which do not make much difference and many legitimate questions have been raised on the degree awarded
 shiksha kii uplabdhta or daakhile ke maamle main kaaphi pragati to hui he lekin ab nai chintaa shiksha kii gunvattta ko lekar badhati ja rahi he
 The issue of "inclusive" education system has been left far away
 rashtriya shiksha shodh or prashikshan parishad (ensiiarti), enjio pratham (eyesiaar), or gujarat sarkaar ke sanchaalan main chalane vaala ''gunotsav" bhi pichley kareeb 15 saal se padhai or nitiyon par amal ke str ke akalan main jute hue hai
 His recent studies present a very disappointing picture
 masalan, eyesiaar, 2014 ke mutabik aathvin kaksha ke 25 pratishat bachche duusari kaksha ke paath nahin pard sakate, gramin skulon main duusari kaksha ke aise chaatro kii sankhya 2010 main 13
 32 in 2014, up 4 percent
 5 pratishat ho gai he jinhen akshar gyaan tak nahin he
 The level of education in government schools declined sharply between 2010 and 2012
 paanchavin kaksha ke aadhe bachche aisi buniyadi baaten bhi nahin sikh paae the, jo unhen duusari kaksha main sikh leni chahie thi
 About 50 percent of children complete eight years of schooling without learning the basics of mathematics
 iske baad yah bataane ke liye kisi vishesh tippanee kii darkaar nahin he ki hamaari shiksha vyavastha baari durdasha kii shikaar he or usamen fouran sudhaar ke liye thos kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 Due to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, there has also been an increased emphasis on infrastructure with admission to schools, but now new serious issues have emerged which need to be resolved
 khaskar ''fail na karne kii niti" par dobaaraa vichaar karne kii jarurat he
 It should be assured that this is optional and should be done with prudence
 shiksha vyavastha main, skool or ucchtar shiksha donon ke str par nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari ke sambandh main koi spasht niti nahin he
 There is scope to adopt different methods in different states in this matter, but the roles of the government and private sector are not clear
 siddhant rup main hamaari vyavastha yah mantra japti dikhti he ki shiksha shkaarobaarya nahin he, ki kisi shiksha santhaan kaa uddeshy munafa kamanaa hi nahin hona chahie
 But like all other areas of public life, reality is completely different from these mantras
 pichley do dashakon main ucchtar shiksha sansthaanon main baari vruddhi darasal ''capitesan fees" ke chalan par aadhaarit he, jo kaale dhan or sandigdh vittiya len-dein par palati he
 There is also the fact that many so-called "charitable learning trusts" aim to make pure money and in most cases run their business in connivance with or fueled by the political fraternity
 ye sab ghatnakram gambhir or ati kathor sudhaaron ke takaaje kii yaad dilaate hai
 The quality of academic research is much lower than expected in both total admissions and results
 academik kshetra main sakriyata or teji ke liye nae vichaaron or shodh kii darkaar he
 This area needs special attention which can contribute greatly to our economy
 har mahatvakankshi samaaj main maa-baap kii swaabhaavik chahat yahi hogi ki unke bachche ''acchhee shiksha" paaen
 However, there have been no serious formal efforts to develop skills for the employment sector and to set academic standards at par
 iskaa yah bhi matlab he ki degree ke saath aage badaae ke raste muhaiyaa nahin hai
 Urgent attention is also needed to create an environment to make quality employment training a respectable status and to make them acceptable in the society
 ek bada or nayaa pahalu soochna or sanchaar takanic kaa bade paimaane par istemaal he
 New technology is now available in exchange of information, increase in skills and many other cases, but they have not yet been adequately utilized in the field of education
 gunvattta main sudhaar, shikshakon kii taiyaari, kaksha main shikshak kii madadgaar takanic or koching ke liye takanic main ijaphe kii prachur sambhaavnaaen hai
 This direction should be seriously considered
 chaatro kii padhai ke str, chaatro ke pradarshan se shikshakon ke pradarshan ko jodgaye, alag-alag skulon kii pragati ko jaanchane jaise anginat chijen ''big data" se kii ja sakati hai
 Of course, technology has reached India in a big way, but it has not yet been attempted to suit Indian conditions
 khushkismati se, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay, khaskar maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne shiksha kshetra ke punerjeevan ke liye bade kadam uthaae hai or ve jaldi hi nai shiksha niti kii ghoshnaa karne kaa iraadaa rakhti hai
 This is a very welcome move
 ummid kii jaati he ki nai pahal shiksha kshetra ko nai disha degi, shiksha ke maanakon main baari giravat ko rokegi, or behatar gunvatttapurna maanakon kii raah prashast karegi
 The political will to raise the level of education, eliminate or at least eliminate political interference at all levels, can bring India to the world stage in a single generation
 so, nai niti ke daanv oonche hai, isi se tay hoga ki bharat is sadi main vishwa guru banegaa yaa nahin

 Strongly criticizing Rahul Gandhi's comments about the 2002 riots in Gujarat, the BJP today said that many rioters were killed in the state police firing to prevent the violence, while the 1984 anti-sikh riots were state-sponsored to prevent The police did not fire a single bullet and the rioting crowd openly murdered Sikhs by raising blood slogans
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh arun jetali ne rahul ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki gujarat dangon ke bare main congress upaadhyaksh jaankaree ke abhaav se grast hai or unhone us bare main jimmedaarana bayaan nahin diya he
 While denying Rahul's statement that there was no action by the state government to stop the Gujarat riots and the then Congress regime taking action to stop the anti-sikh riots, Jaitley said that the truth is contrary
 gujarat main hajaaron log giraftaar kiye gaye or police ne halaat par kaabo paane ke liye kai sthanon par bade paimaane par firing kii jisamen lagbhag 300 dangai maare gaye
 a case was registered against thousands and hundreds were punished
 ames main hi lagane lage the khun ke badale khun ke narecongress par palatwaar karte hue jetali ne kaha ki duusari ore 1984 ke dangon main 31 aktubar kii dopaher ko ames, jahaan indira gandhi kaa parthiv sharir rakhaa hua tha, vahaan khun kaa badla khun ke naare lagane lage or kathith rup se congress netaa hajaaron sikhon kii hatya karne vaali bheed kii aguwai karte dekhe gaye
 Jaitley questioned the Congress vice-president, where did it come from in Rahul Gandhi's imagination that the state had no collusion in the 1984 riots
 jisane kii jaanch use bana diya congress ne saandjetali ne kaha ki 1984 ke dangon ke maamalon kii jaanch nahin kii gai
 a Commission of Inquiry was constituted which gave the impostor report
 unhone kaha ki ayog kii aguwai jis jaj ne kii baad main congress ne use rajyasabha kaa sadsy bana diya or aaj bhi peediton ko nyaay kii pratiksha he
 Significantly, in an interview to a TV channel on Monday night, Rahul accused the Narendra Modi government of inciting and aggravating the 2002 riots and claimed that the Congress government had tried to stop the 1984 riots
 bakaul rahul, gujarat or 1984 main fark yah he ki gujarat sarkaar dangon main shaamil thi
 Modi was the chief minister when the Gujarat riots took place
 gujarat sarkaar vastav main dangon ko or uksaa or bhadkaa rahi thi
 Not seen the clean chit of the Supreme Court, Rahul Nejtali said that all the allegations against Modi for the riots have been proved wrong
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri supreme court dwaara gathit vishesh jaanch dal sahit kai jaanchon kaa saamana kar chuke hai or unke khilaaf koi sakshya nahin paaya gaya
 Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad asked Rahul to explain what is the concentration of power in the Congress that led him to become the vice-president of his party and a group anthem started declaring him as the prime ministerial candidate
 unhone kaha ki duusari ore narendra modi kaa udhaaharan he jo garibi main paidaa hue or apni kadi mehnat, eemaandaaree or shashan ke apane ricard kii badaulat pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke str tak panhuche
 Another party leader Subramanian Swamy alleged that more people were killed in the 1984 anti-sikh riots than the Gujarat riots
 rahul ke pita ne sahi tehraaya tha dangon koh jaavdekrudhar bhaajapa pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi rahul ke aaropon ko puri tarah galat bataate hue aarope lagaaya ki 1984 kii tabaahi rajya pryojit thi
 Javadekar said that no one justified the unfortunate Gujarat riots, but on the other hand, Rahul's father Rajiv Gandhi justified the 1984 massacre by saying that when a big tree falls, the earth vibrates
 jabaki sachai iske ulat yah he ki jab dharti dolati he to bade ped girte hai

 The one who is raising his voice against the government and the ruling party, his breath is being taken away

 At the same time, tension was also created in Ganjam district over the murder of another BJP worker Santosh Kumar Pati
 banaaskantha ke babuji ke paas do acre hi jameen he
 Earlier it was difficult to survive on farming, but in the last ten years, they almost stopped farming and started animal husbandry
 aaj unke paas kareeb 19 gaayen hai
 Now even in the fields, fodder is grown only for cows and buffaloes
 aakhir pashupaalan se doodh kii aamadani hi itani he
 He earns around two lakh rupees every month

 Even after taking out the expenses, they earn very well

 There is a milk collection center in every village, so that livestock owners do not have to go outside the village to sell milk
 sirf gaanv ke centre main jaakar doodh jamaa karwaanaa hota he
 Here milk is kept in a state-of-the-art manner, Banas Dairy itself maintains a smooth system of transporting milk to dairy
 pashupalkon ko vakt par paisa mil jaataa he or wo bhi cashles tareeke se sidhaa unke apane bank khaaton main
 The dairy center also has an ATM from which money can be withdrawn at any time
 kuch barason pehle banaaskantha gujarat kaa sabase pichhadaa jila tha
 Water was less, so life was not easy
 lekin sahakaari taur par deyari kaa vyavsaay gujarat main aisa apanaaya gaya ki ye sabase pichhadaa jila aaj sirf desh kaa hi nahin lekin puure asia kaa sabase zyada dugdh utpaadit karne vaala jila ban gaya he
 The Banas Dairy here collects about 5 million liters of milk every day, and in addition to everyday milk, making butter, ice cream and other products like this adds value to the farmers by adding value
 vajah pashupaalan se judi har suvidha pashupalkon ko muft muhaiyaa karwaanaa he
 Shankar Chaudhary, president of Banas Dairy, says that selling milk only after collecting it is not cooperative
 unhone pashuon ke biimaar hone par muft main pash chikitsak kii suvidha jutai he
 Such factories of fodder have been made, where the fodder that is made in a scientific way gives more milk than animal food
 tippaniyan After earning a name in Asia, Banas Dairy is now preparing this milk revolution across the country
 sabase pehle gujarat ke baahar uttar pradesh main apana sahakaari model aajamaaya ja rahaa he
 Banas Dairy will make milk production and other products from its model in more than 10 districts of Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh gujarat se bahut bada he, doodh bhi gujarat se chaar guna hota he lekin sangrah or marketing kii vyavastha na hone se pashupaalak pareshaan hai, unhen apane doodh ke sahi daam nahin milte
 In Gujarat today, more than 42 rupees per liter of cattle are given, which is the best in the country
 shankar choudhary ke mutabik philhal banaas deyari uttar pradesh main rojaanaa kareeb teen lakh litre doodh ikattha kar rahi he or 2022 tak 20 lakh litre tak kaa lakshya he
 Factories have also been built for this in Lucknow and Kanpur
 jald hi varanasi main bhi factory taiyaar ho jaaegi
 Everything will be done from the cooperative model of Gujarat where there is no owner of dairy, cattle are themselves
 jo bhi munafa hota he wo bhi pashupalkon ko saal ke ant main bonus ke taur par mil jaataa he
 If Uttar Pradesh finds Gujarat to be a true model, then there is scope to overtake Gujarat
 kisaanon ko lag rahaa he agar doodh ke saath saath krishi main bhi agar sahakaari model apanaaya jaay to kisaanon kii badahaali bhi kuch kam ho sakane kii gunjaaish he

 a few years ago, Banaskantha was the most backward district of Gujarat
 pani kam tha isliye jindagi aasaan nahin thi
 But cooperatively, the dairy business was adopted in Gujarat so that this most backward district has become the largest milk producing district not only of the country but of the whole of Asia
 yahaan kii banaas deyari roj kareeb 50 lakh litre doodh ikattha karti he, or usamen se rosemara ke doodh ke alaava is tarah butter, icecream or anya utpaada banaakar vailu adishan karke kisaanon ke liye munafa jamaa karti he
 The reason is to provide every animal related facility free of cost to the cattle rearers
 banaas deyari ke adhyaksh shankar choudhary kahete hai ki sirf doodh jamaakar use bechnaa hi sahakaarita nahin he
 They have provided the facility of a veterinarian free of cost when animals become ill
 chaare kii aisi factoriyaan banaai hai jahaan jo vaigyanik tareeke se chaara banataa he wo khaane se pashu doodh bhi zyada dete hai
 The comments asia main naam kamaane ke baad ab banaas deyari puure desh main ye doodh kranti kii taiyaari main he
 Firstly, its cooperative model is being tried in Uttar Pradesh outside Gujarat
 banaas deyari uttar pradesh ke kareeb 10 se zyada jilon main apane model se doodh utpaadan or anya utpaada banaaegi
 Uttar Pradesh is much larger than Gujarat, milk is four times the size of Gujarat but due to lack of arrangements for collection and marketing, cattle rearers are not getting the right price for their milk
 gujarat main aaj prati litre pashupaalak ko kareeb 42 se zyada rupye die jate hai jo ki desh main sabase behatar he
 According to Shankar Chaudhary, at present Banas Dairy is collecting about three lakh liters of milk daily in Uttar Pradesh and the target is to reach 20 lakh liters by 2022
 lakhanu or kanpur main iske liye factoriyaan bhi bana lee gayi hai
 Soon the factory in Varanasi will also be ready
 sab kuch gujarat ke sahakaari model se hi hoga jahaan deyari kaa maalik koi nahin he, khud pashupaalak hi hai
 Whatever profit is made, the cattle owners also get a bonus at the end of the year
 uttar pradesh agar gujarat ko model sahi taur par apana paaya to gujarat se aage nikalne kii bhi gunjaish he
 Farmers are feeling that if the cooperative model is adopted in milk as well as in agriculture, then there is a possibility that the plight of the farmers may be reduced

 -input bhashaa The Jokihat assembly by-election in Bihar was a noose for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, but in this battle of prestige, he was defeated at the hands of Tejashwi Yadav, who is fast identifying as the state's biggest opposition leader
 jokihat vidhansabha upachunaavamein 24 daur tak chali matganana ke baad argedy ummidavaar shahanvaaj alam ne 41 hajaar se zyada maton ke antar ke saath jeet apane naam kar lee
 RJD has emerged victorious from here for the first time
 shahanvaj ne apane nikatatam pratidwandi jediu ke murshid alam ko 41,224 maton ke antar se haraaya
 Shahnawaz got 81,240 while Murshid got 40,016 votes
 shuraat main dikhi kadi takkarsubah 8 baje baje matganana shuru hone ke baad kuch der tak jediu ummidavaar murshid alam shuruaati rujhaanon main aage chal rahe the, lekin chathe round ke matganana ke baad hi baaji palatati dikhi or iske baad se hiargediummidavaarshahanvaj almalgataar apni badhat banaae rakhi
 In a special conversation till date, RJD candidate Shahnawaz Alam said that Nitish Kumar and his government had camped in Jokihat for more than 1 month and even tried to influence the elections, yet it could not succeed in its plan
 
 lagaataar 4 jeet ke baad haarashhanvaaj alam ne kaha ki rajyasabha saansad aaaraseepi singh tathabihar sarkaarake kai mantri lagaataar jokihat main chunaavon se pehle bane hue the lekin iskaa koi phayda unhen nahin mila
 Shahnawaz said that even after spending lakhs of rupees and making full use of administrative staff, JDU had to face defeat
 jokihat vidhansabha upachunaav main jediu kii haaranithish kumaarake liye bada jhatka he
 Since becoming the Chief Minister in 2005, Nitish Kumar's party JDU has been winning the Jokihat Assembly elections four times in a row, but this time it has had to face the heat
 tejasvi bane bade netajokihat vidhansabha upachunaav nitish ke liye kahin naa kahin naak kaa sawaal ban gaya tha lekin argedy ne nitish ke sabhi mansoobon par pani pher diya he
 Even before the election, the battle of Jokihat was not JDU vs RJD but Nitish Kumar vs RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav kii anupasthiti main tejasvi yadav jokihat main party kaa morcha sambhaal rakhaa tha or antat fatah hasil kii
 jdu's election defeat in Jokihat has also proved that Nitish Kumar's decision to leave the Grand Alliance last year and form a government with BJP has not been liked by Muslim voters, whose brunt of the party was also seen in Araria Lok Sabha by-election 2 months ago
 Where JDU suffered a drastic defeat and RJD candidate Sarfaraz Alam won
 vahiin jokihat main mili chunavi jeet argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ke liye badi uplabdhi he

 maujuuda samay main congress ke paas ek bhi saansad nahin he
 In the 2017 assembly elections, Congress could win only one seat from Purvanchal area
 jabaki congress sapa ke saath milakar chunaav maidan main utari thi
 Purvanchal used to be the strongest stronghold for the Congress at one time

 inamen kushinagar, salempur, mirzapur, pratapgarh, bhadohi, sant kabir nagar, basti or maharajaganj loksabhaa siten shaamil hai
 In these eight seats of Purvanchal, Congress veterans are considered very strong

 Laliteshpati Tripathi, the great-grandson of former UP Chief Minister Kamalapati Tripathi, is contesting the Mirzapur seat adjacent to Banaras
 salempur seat par congress ke purv saansad rajesh mishra bijepi or gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 Whereas, in Pratapgarh seat, the Congress has spoiled the equation of everyone by removing Ratna Singh, daughter of former foreign minister Dinesh Singh and who has been MP many times
 congress ne bhadohi seat par azamgarh se kai baar saansad rah chuke ramakant yadav ko utaara he
 Although Bhadohi is a new area for Ramakant, despite this he has been giving tough competition to both BSP and BJP candidates

 When asked to support Jairam Ramesh's statement about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress MP said that he was the first person to say that there are not many things in the Modi government that are viewed positively
 unhone kaha, ‘‘modi is chunaav main vot pratishat ko 31 se badhaakar 37 karne main safal rahe hai or jab congress kaa vot pratishat 19 fisadi hi rahaa to hamen yah samajhane ke liye prayaas karnaa hoga ki aisa kyon hua

 'sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa ganit bhi bigadegakashi yadav kehete hai priyanka ko laakar congress bijepi ke saath-saath sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko bhi nuksaan kar sakati he

 aise main congress ne priyanka kaa daanv chalakar bijepi ko tagada jhatka diya he
 Mishra says that Priyanka has been given the responsibility of Purvanchal, where the politics of Dhuri is Brahmin and Rajput
 haalanki raajnneetik taur par donon samudaay ek duusare ke dhur virdohi maane jate hai
 After the BJP came to power in UP, the Brahmin could not get the attention he was expecting

 mere mitra narbhas laal is dharti par tab avatarit hue the, jab desh main nasbandi kaarykram apane sampurna parakram ke saath chal rahaa tha
 His father Dubba Lal was a vassal of the sterilization program, but had already become the father of 6 children before becoming a murid
 so, nasbandi karakar unhone narbhas laal ke is dharti par aane kii sambhaavna ko khatm hi kar diya tha
 He also underwent sterilization with his favorite friend and famous doctor
 lekin kaha jaataa he na ki jise aana hota he use koun roak saktaa he
 Just as all the opposition parties did not do the sterilization right but Jugalbandi to stop Narendra Modi from coming back to power, yet Modi threatened to come back to power again
 thik isitarah dubba laal ke ghar saatvin santan aa hi gaya
 Shocking and bewildered, Dubba Lal, in a complaining tone, met Dr
 Chola and reported the arrival of the seventh child
 dubba laal ne jab da
 When he saw this condition of his thigh, he felt sorry for his friend
 dubba laal ne kaha ki, ‘thole ! nervas kyon ho rahe ho, jis dharti par bachche aankh, kaan, naak or gadaa tak main paidaa ho jate hai vahaan tumhaari nasbandi kii kya aukaat he
 Well, if you have a son, then at least name it

 The chin felt relieved but according to his mood he turned the child's name to Narbhas Lal
 istarah narbhas laal naamak ratna is desh main badhate, palate or khelte hue jawan ho gaya
 Narbhas Lal has never done injustice to his name
 skool ke dinon main unhe ek shikshak ne bataaya ki asli chaatr vah hota he jiske man main sawaalon kaa ambara laga hua ho
 In every matter whose 'why' arises in his mind, he is the ultimate knowledgeable student
 narbhas laal ne is baat kii ganth baandh lee
 There were so many questions in the class that the teacher and Narbhas Lal's classmates got upset
 phir ek shikshak ne narbhas laal ke ‘kyon’ ke prakope se bachane kaa rasta nikaala
 The teacher was successful in telling Narbhas Lal why he should find the answer himself and tell it to the world only when Narbhas Lal's name would be famous in the whole world
 is tarah janm or gyaan praapt karne ke baad narbhas laal ham sab ke bich upasthit ho chuke hai
 He keeps an eye on every incident in the country and abroad
 har din vah kuch na kuch baton kaa manan-chintan karte hai or apane moulik vichaaron ke saath mujh se mukhaatib hote rahete hai
 If i am on vacation, he does not forget to call and inform me about his thoughts
 unhone mujhe is baat ke liye raji kar liya he yaa yun kahen ki mujhe peechha chhudaane ke liye raji hona hi padaa he ki main, har hafte, unke moulik vichaaron main se kisi ek yaa do ko pathakon tak pahunchaa duungaa

 Since last night, Narbhas has been speaking out against Lal Dhoni
 maine unhe kaha ki bhai rahane do kai baar balla nahin chal paata he
 Hearing this, Dhoni became furious with me as well
 bole, balla kaise nahin chalata he
 'you have not seen a legislator in Madhya Pradesh caught a bat for the first time in life and gave it to the officer
 or aisa nahin he ki is vidhayak ke pita ne use balla thamaya tha
 His father was famous by jutting the officers as mayor
 dhonia (dhoni) to jivan bhar balla bhaanjata rahaa he
 At least on the video, that MLA could have seen the bat banging, then the chopper shot could have been confirmed
 ’ maine baat badale ke liye narbhas laal se kaha ki dekha nahin vidhayak ke balla bhaanjane kaa nateeja, jail janaa padaa use
 Narbhas Lal, who is going to be silent? fouran hi bole to kya hua jab jail se bel par baahar niklaa to kaise gende ke phool kaa motaa-motaa maala (haar) samarthakon ne uske gale main daal diya
 Well i said whatever happens after going to jail, he will never beat an officer again with the bat
 narbhas laal bole, ‘tumhaara aankalan thik he
 The son belongs to his father and will come into the discussion only when he tries to exploit an officer
 khayr tum bechaare vidhayak ke peeche kyon pad gaye ho
 In Uttar Pradesh, i had not seen how an MP working in the same party had given a lawmaker to a legislator of his own party in a meeting
 ’ narbhas laal bole darasal, jis tarah se puri duniyaan ek chakra main gumti he usee tarah gariyaane, dhakiyane, jutiyane, thappadiyane, ped se baandh kar peetane, daura-daura kar peetane, nanga karne ke peetane, lita kar peetane, bitha kar peetane, khadaa kar peetane kaa ek chakra chalata he
 This cycle is eternal
 kuch samay se ise maav linching kaa naam bhi diya jane laga he
 The cycle of government goes on and on with this eternal cycle
 main narbhas laal kii baton main kho gaya or ek bhayaavah kalpana se guzarane laga, tabhi narbhas laal ne jhakzodate hue kaha, narbhasa gaye kya ? main kuch bolta usase pehle narbhas laal ne chaay kii pyaali meri ore badha di
 On the go, Narbhar Lal has instructed that "there should not be any splash with his language", that is why it has been my compulsion to present the above language unabashedly in front of you
 (sujith thakur india today main assistant editor hai)*** This series started on 21 August this year
 jab iraq or syria main sakriy aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ne pehla sir kalam karte hue pehla video jari kiya tha
 This was followed by three more dates
 2 sitambar, 13 sitambar or teen oktober
 Every date brought another video with them
 ek aisa video jisamen ek kaa sir kalam karte dikhaaya jaataa or duusare ko aglaa jinda shikaar bataaya jaataa
 This time the same thing has happened
 chauthe sir ke saath paanchavin dhamkee
 So far, four pictures of ISIS vandalism have been released, videos of the brutal killing of four people
 ek 21 agast kii, duusari do sitambar kii
 3rd of September 13th
 or chauthi 3 oktober kii
 Almost the same place in all four pictures
 thik usee tarah ke kapade main nakaabposh
 And just like the unaided American and British journalist in orange clothes
 or to or jis tarah pehle video main ek patrkaar kaa sir kalam karne ke baad duusare ko jinda dikhaa kar dhamkee di gai thi
 In the same video, in the second video, after beheading one, a new hostage was finally shown alive and threatened
 tisare video ke aakhir main phir se chauthe shaks ko dikhaa kar dhamak di gai
 And now exactly the same old threat showing the fifth hostage at the end of this fourth video
 dhamkee ki iesas ke khilaaf jane par aglaa sir iskaa hoga
 British citizen Alan Henning beheaded American journalist James Foley
 uske baad british patrkaar steven footlauf kaa sir
 Then the head of human rights activist and British hostage David Hanes
 or ab ek or british naagarik alan banning kaa sir
 Just like James Foley, James Sautloff and David Hanes, Alan Henning was also dressed in orange
 thik usee tarah kaa nakaabposh is baar bhi alan ke bagal main khadaa hota he
 Before beheading Alan, he is also given a bad statement of supporting Obama and his policies against Britain
 alan ke bolne ke baad thik pehle ke teenon video kii tarah hi ab ye nakaabposh aatankavadi america or obama ko dhamkata he
 Allen is also beheaded immediately after threatening America and Obama
 iske baad video main phir ek nae bandhak ko dikhaaya jaataa he
 This fifth mortgage is from America
 isaki pahchaan peter edward kaseig ke taur par hui he
 Threat is the same
 meri baat nahin maani to aglaa sir iskaa
 Both the United States and Britain have condemned the imprisonment and said that they will find and punish the criminals of ISIS
 par sawaal ab bhi vahi he
 The question is, how long will this video and the series of heads last? Four heads have been penned so far with four videos
 ab kya paanchaven bandhak kaa bhi paanchvaan video aayega? chathe bandhak ke saath? yaa usase pehle iesas kii darindagi ko koi khatm karegaa? Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who took the program on Sunday demanding full statehood, has accused the BJP of hiding its failures
 dilli bijepi ne rajghat ke saamne pradarshan karte hue kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya se pehle kejariwal pani or bijli hi thik se den
 Party state president Manoj Tiwari said that Kejriwal has no meaning with the full state but he is talking about the full state with the aim of hiding his failures
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki dilli ne madanlaal khurana, sahib singh verma or shila dikshit mukhyamantri rahe lekin kisi ke kaam nahin ruke or naa hi inamen se kisi ne purna rajya naa hone ko kabhi apni naakaami chhipaane kaa jariya banaaya
 But Kejriwal has tried to hide the failures of the last three and a half years by talking about the full state
 dilli bijepi ke pradarshan main manoj tiwari ke alaava teenon mahaamantri samet sainkadon kaaryakarta shaamil hue
 Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, said that Kejriwal has given his full strength for a new play to demand full statehood to Delhi at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium
 gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki yah ek asafal or haare hue netaa kii rajnatik hataasha kaa pratik he
 Gupta alleged that irrespective of the people of Delhi, Kejriwal has created such a structure of lies and deception that will be an excuse for him during his remaining tenure, while the truth is that the powers that the Chief Minister got in the present structure Kejriwal has not been able to use them properly
 gupta ne kaha ki jab sedilli vidhansabhabani he tab se yahi system puri safalataa ke saath kaam kar rahaa he
 Gupta also lashed out at Kejriwal through Jan Lokpal and said that 'one such drama was done by Kejriwal with regard to the Jan Lokpal bill
 kejariwal ise vidhansabha main pesh tak nahin kar sake
 He said that Kejriwal first sat on a couch in the office of the Lieutenant Governor on a couch and the Chief Minister and his council of ministers slept for 9 days
 iske baad mukhyamantri nijee kaarnon se 10 din kii chuttee par bangalore nikal gaye or ab jab dilli waapas aaye he to unka shashan chalaane kaa koi mood nahin dikhataa
 bjp's Kejriwal has been asked by the BJP, and the BJP has asked Kejriwal the question and said that the Chief Minister will have to answer what he did to reduce water shortages, reduce pollution and save trees from cutting

 iske baad is 10 varshiya amaar ne bhi apane chehre ko scan karke iphone x analock kar diya
 We do not confirm the veracity of this video either
 yah video kaaphi viral ho rahaa he or ise utyub par 14 november ko aplod kiya gaya he or ab tak ise 4 lakh baar dekha ja chukaa he
 This child named Amar Malik, seen in this video, inadvertently unlocked the iphone X, then his parents decided to make this video
 is video ko ataullah malik naam ke ek yujar ne utyub par aplod kiya he
 The description of this video reads, 'we have seen a flood of videos on youtube in which people are trying out iphone x and we have tried to fool its Face ID
 iphone x lene kaa baad hamaara iraadaa aisa nahin ta,lekin 3 november ko jab hamane isaki settinkar lee iske baad ham bedroom main baithe the tabhi hamaara 10 saal kaa betaa aayaa or usne iphone x le liya
 My wife said that she is locked with her face ID and cannot open another
 lekin aisa nahin hua or bete kaa cheharaa dekhakar hi iphonex analock ho gaya
 In a conversation with Wired Portal, Ataullah said that he unlocked it as many times as he tried
 unhone kaha he, ‘ham phase idi ko disable nahin karnaa chaahate, kyonki yah kaaphi aasaan he
 But in the case of privacy, it is very difficult, 'currently no official statement has been issued by Apple on this matter

 Lu also did not say anything directly to General Rawat's remarks that India and China resolved the issue of Chinese troops' plans to build a road in Indian territory in Arunachal Pradesh's Tooting in the last week of December
 unhone arunachal pradesh par china ke daawey ko doharaaya
 China has been describing Arunachal as part of South Tibet
 lu ne kaha, ‘mere sahakarmi isse jude sawaal par kai baar pratikriya jaahir kar chuke hai
 i must reiterate that there is a huge dispute on the eastern side of the china-india border
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lihaaja, hamen aam raay ke jariye samjhaute par pahunchnaa hoga

 aap unase nafrat kar sakate hai, unhen haraane main mazaa le sakate hai yaa unhen adiyal kah sakate hai, lekin aap australia ko is vakt duniya kii sabase majboot team maanane se inkaar nahin kar sakate jisane paanch alag alag mahadwipon main vishwa vijeta hone kaa paracham laharaaya ho
 This team has given 4 names out of the last five World Cups, so much so that it has such a structure of cricket that everyone can be jealous
 lagaataar haar or naakaami unhen kachotati he or ise wo bardaasht nahin kar pate
 If a star comes or some officer goes, his hunger for victory never ends
 is vishwa cap ko apane haathon main thame maaikel clark ab apane desh ke liye kabhi bhi rangeen jersey main nazar nahin aaenge
 It is also possible that stars like Mitchell Johnson, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson may not appear in the next World Cup, but assume that this team will dominate the next World Cup as well
 ek mahaan team banane ke liye aapke paas laajawab gendbaaz hone chahie or is vakt australia kii team yuva or tej gendbaazon se labalab he
 Mitchell Starc - 25 years, Josh Hazelwood - 24 years, James Faulkner - 24 years, Pat Cummins 21 years and James Pattinson 24 years, being so fit and fast young bowlers is a danger bell for the rest of the team
 haa, team ke paas abhi bhi ek acha spinner nahin he lekin ye kami test maichon main zyaada khal sakati he, chote formatt main nahin
 If you add Steven Smith's form and commitment with all this, then this team is going to get a captain in the coming times, even if he is 23 years old, but in a few months he has won the heart of every critic of Australia
 
 lekin ye bhi dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ye team apane ghar se baahar kaisaa khelti he kyonki pichley kuch saalon main da
 Apart from Africa, no team has been more impressed by playing outside their home
 magar samay se pehle is sawaal ke bare main charchaa bhi thik nahin
 The thing that you think of as your strength, Australia players attack it first
 team ne vishwa cap main champion hone kaa gaurav hasil kiya he isliye vakt abhi jashn kaa he
 At the same time, this World Cup has decided that the death of ODI cricket is not going to happen as quickly as some cricket-pundits often predict, but no one should consider the success of this tournament as a guarantee of the return of ODI cricket
 Is supposed to do deshon ke bich hone vaali vanade series main abhi bhi darshakon kii zyaada ruchi nahin he
 Yes, tournaments such as Asia Cup, Champions Trophy and World still arouse people in the country, which brings back the beauty of odis
 ummid he itani samaj isisi ko bhi ab aa gai hogi
 It is also important to praise New Zealand
 har isisi toornament main team kaa pradarshan aisa rahata he ki phens kabhi maayoos nahin hote
 The pool or number of players playing cricket in this country will probably be as much as in any small district in India but still the team always convinces everyone with fearless cricket and zhujaru attitude
 brandan makkulam kii captaini kii har koi tarif kar rahaa he lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki wo dhoni yaa clark kii lig main abhi hai
 The Kiwi team has always played well under their circumstances and this World Cup told them that it will remain intact in the coming times
 da
 What to talk about Africa? Nobody has ever doubted their talent
 is desh ke phens kaa dard or gussa samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 No one has an answer as to why the team does not win
 log inhen chokars kehete hai shaayad ye is baat kii gavaahi he ki wo is team se kitni ummiden lagaae rahete hai
 It is said that Luck comes with the same guarantee that he can change at any time, but the fate of the proteas is that they are still angry with him
 inhen zaroorat bas ek lucky captain kii he
 From the West Indies and England, now their fans are not hopeless but also hopeless
 kai saalon se yahaan cricket ram-bharose hi chal rahaa he
 In the West Indies, it has become difficult to say how long this game will last
 tallent kii kabhi yahaan koi kami nahin rahi, lekin jahaan khilaadiyon ke man main desh ke prati khilne kaa koi gaurav na ho, jahaan haar ke baad mil rahi haar khilaadiyon or adhikariyon ko pareshaan na karti ho, jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa koi system nazar na aata ho, vahaan cricket kii dasha or disha or bhala kisi ho sakati he
 There is pity on England
 jis khel ko usne duniya bhar main failaayaa ab usee ke liye wo paraayaa ho gaya he
 Despite such a strong cricketing structure, if a team always feels disappointed then the shortage becomes more of the officials and selectors
 apni galatiyon se na siikhnaa or shutuuramurg jaisaa ravaiya apnaane vaale english cricket board kii jab tak soch nahin badalegi, tab tak is desh ke liye nattejey bhi nahi badalenge
 What to say about India
 team ne lagaataar jeet kaa record banaaya
 Also set a record for all-out opposing teams
 jis tarah kaa vishwa cap ke aayojan kaa formatt tha usase ye to tay tha ki team india quarter final main pahunch jaaegi
 It was also decided to go into the last four due to a clash in the quarter-final against Bangladesh
 magar australia ke khilaaf mukaable ne donon tiimon ke bich ke antar ko bhi sabake saamne laa diya
 The team demonstrated that the fans should not be disappointed and that all questions should be lost amidst the glare of IPL when they get home
 aane vaale kaaphi samay main team india ko apane ghar main apni pasandida pichon par hi khelnaa he yani ol iz wel kii awaajen aati rahengin
 What was the performance of the players, this shows that when the ICC made their World Cup team, no Indian player got a place in it
 vaise ye sochane kii baat he ki under-19 cricket ho yaa fir amerging cricket toornamet ho, bharat kaa pradarshan hameshaa shandaar rahata he auki ham hameshaa australia se behatar pradarshan karte hai lekin jab baat in yuva khilaadiyon ko mahaan banane kii hoti he to hamaara system kangaaroon se maat kha jaataa he
 In the meantime, Twitter and Facebook should thank Anushka and Virat that both have given such excellent jokes in the last few days that the grief of defeat was not felt

 In a way, the ball is now in his court and he has to decide what position he will give to his movement on Lokpal

 unhone or 2014 main upiessi pariksha kii topper rahi shaareerik rup se viklang ira singhl ne kaha, ''takreeban har ladki ko kabhi na kabhi yah baat kahi gai he ki vah amuk kaam nahin kar sakati

 unhone kaha, ''main roj ek jang lard rahi hum, un mata-pita ko raji karne kii koshish main lagi hum jo apni betiyon ko chhod dena yaa khatm kar dena chaahate hai
 "these are the success stories of women who are fighting against the orthodox perceptions of society in everyday life
" inhen main ek hai nandini harinath, jo mangal abhiyaan kii upanideshak hai or isro main rahete hue is abhiyaan kii sanchaalak thim
 He said that he has never been discriminated against within ISRO, but due to the cultural diversity here, the number of women scientists in India is so low
 harinath kii tarah hasya kalakaar aditi mittal ne bhi rudh dharanaon ko todgaye kaa kaam kiya he
 She does not like being called a female comedian
 ve kahati hai, ''mahila koi shrenee nahin he
 Everything i do is not 'female humor', i generate humor from the surrounding things and the scene
 ''shahari aakroshadharanaen sirf peshon tak simit nahin hai
 There was also a lot of discussion on urban outrage in this conference, ranging from losing weight to reproductive dysfunction, broken marriages and divorce
 manochikitsak varkha chulani, poshan visheshgy rujuta divekar or abhinetri bhoomi pednekar ne vajan par charchaa karte hue sawaal uthaaya ki kya patala hona vastav main saundarya kaa lakshan he or yah ki kaise bachapan ke dinon se hi apni chhavi ke bare main ladakiyon ko chetaya jane lagata he or khud parivaar vaale ladakiyon ko acha dikhne (patala dikhne) ko kehete hai

 The chief guest in the evening session was Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, who concluded the conference by distributing the award
 unhone kaha, ''gharon ke bheetar maansikta ko badalane kii jarurat he
 Our expectations from sons and daughters should not be different
 donon main hi jimmedaari kaa ehsaas hona chahie
 Why should only the daughters be questioned about their movements
 ''sammelan kaa ant india today vuman aword 2015 se hua jisamen nau mahilaon ko puraskaar die gaye
 The atmosphere of the parents and husband of the first woman officer of India, Lieutenant Kiran Shekhawat, who lost her life while on duty, was enraged
 aurat hone ke dard or sukh ko manaane kaa isse behatar mauka or tarika kuch nahin ho saktaa tha
 He received the India Today Woman Award: Story Teller Award Juhi Chaturvedi, Screenwriter in Science Award Nandini Harinath, Physicist, Mangal Expedition Director, Khel Award, Eastern Chandela, Shooter Hemelata Annamalai in Corporate Sector, Founder and CEO, Empower Wehikelson praachi pavaar, adhyaksh, nilavasant medical foundation and research centarprerak mahilabibi sandip cor, 80 dattak betiyon kii maanstil ke libediti raav hydari, abhinetrivuman of da yearira singhl, upiessi main2014 kii toprasaahsee mahilale
 Kiran Shekhawat (posthumously) upi ke shiksha mantri ramgovind choudhary ne bayaan diya he ki in dinon bacchon kii pitayee nahin hoti isliye ve padhai-likhaai nahin karte
 In fact, the minister says that in his time children were beaten, so they used to read and write but now this does not happen
 desh ke sabase bade soobe ke shiksha mantri kaa bayaan bataata he ki duniya bhale badal gai he lekin bacchon ke padhane−padhaane kaa dhang bhi badal gaya lekin maansikta nahin badali he
 The statement of the education minister of the country's largest state shows that the world may have changed but the way of teaching and learning of children has also changed but the mindset has not changed

 After an exciting match in the first Test drawn, Team India is all set
 udhar world number van dakshin africa team bhi jeet se kam kuch bhi nahin chaahati, kam se kam wo jeet ke saath apane test olerounder jaik kallis ko vidaai dena chaahati he
 But statistics are showing that the table is heavy with guests, not hosts
 yani boxing de par shuru hone ja rahe is nirnaayak test main team india ke liye achche sanket hai
 8 runs away from victory in the first Test
 africadakshin africa or duusare number kii team bharat ke bich pehle test ke paanchon din romaanchak sangharsh dekhne ko mila or ise ab tak ke dra hue sarvakalik behtareen test main se ek mana ja rahaa he
 Chasing the biggest goal in Test history, South Africa stayed away from victory by just 8 runs
 duusari taraf bharat hairaan tha ki kaise chaar din ke dabadabe ke baad sirf ek satr ne uski kismat badal di
 Four days into the first Test, India's dominating team was surprised when India gave it a befitting reply
 kohli ne jimmedaari sanbhali or wanders main pehali pari main shatak jad diya jo dakshin africa main or is team ke khilaaf unka pehla shatak bhi he
 South Africa's bowling was not very effective in the first Test and Team India dominated the first four days of the Test
 duniya kii number ek team dakshin africa ne bhi haalanki haar nahin maani
 The team made a comeback and went from a losing streak to an almost win-win situation in three sessions on the final day of the match but ultimately the match was drawn and now everyone's eyes are on Durban
 bharat kii yuva team takkar dene ko taiyaar he
 Team India bowlers should not be tired, the biggest concern for India before the drone test is the tiredness in their fast bowling attack
 jahir, mohammad shami or ishanth sharma ne pehle test main adhikansh samay gendbaaji kii jabaki of spinner ravichandran aswin ne sahyogi kii bhoomika nibhaai
 There is a difference of only three days between the two Tests and it will be important to see if the main bowlers are fit
 wicket par kaaphi uchhaaliske alaava ek sawaal yah ki he ki kya kingsmid main spinner kii bhoomika adhik ahm hogi jahaan pich ke dhimi hone kii sambhaavna he
 Curetaker Wilson Gobis said, 'there is a lot of bounce on this wicket which can be beneficial for both batsmen and bowlers
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yahaan pehali subah ballebaaji kaaphi chunauteepurn hogi kyonki hawa main kuch nami rahati he jiskaa phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Of course Spin could play a role as the match progressed, more than the Wanders helped
 ’ dakshin africa team haalanki spinneron kii madadgaar pich nahin chaahegi
 The South African team won the last Test here, six years ago in January 2008 against the West Indies by an innings and 100 runs
 tab se mejabaan team ne yahaan chaar test ganvaae hai
 In these four tests, the team was reduced to less than 200 runs at least once
 isse bhi badi chintaa kii baat yah he ki team ne in chaar maichon main jo 80 wicket ganvaae usamen se 29 wicket spinneron kii jholii main gaye
 On the previous tour of India in 2010-11, Harbhajan Singh was able to take just two wickets for 169 runs at Centurion but he played a key role in the team's victory, taking six wickets for 80 runs in Durban
 harbhajan ke pradarshan se aswin kaa aatmavishvaas bad saktaa he jinhen johanisburg test kii do pariyon main ek bhi wicket nahin mila
 South Africa has won the ODI series, but South Africa's team was successful in the first blow
 teen vanade kii shrinkhalaa se pehle koi abhyaas match nahin tha or mejabaan team ne iskaa phayda uthaate hue bharat ke khilaaf kuch badi jeet darj kii
 The Indian team came here after a long domestic season and did not know how to deal with the situation here
 pichley kuch samay main sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana jaise diggaj khilaadiyon ke sanyas ke baad yuva team ko kaaphi kuch sabit karnaa tha
 In the ODI series, however, the world number five South Africa, after registering a 2–0 win, sent number one team India to the backfoot
 mejabaan team ne johanisburg main 141 ran or durban main 136 ran se jeet darj kii
 While the third ODI could not be completed due to rain

 On the issue of Kanhaiya Kumar, the president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union, he was openly different from the attitude of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 guuruuvaar ko patna main ek sanvadata sammelan main ramvilas paswan ne kaha, 'kanhaiya ke saath hamaari hamadardi he, bihar ke hai
 We have sympathy, they are young and elected president
 ' Paswan not only showed open sympathy with Kanhaiya but also clarified his stand on the criticism of Jawaharlal Nehru University, that from there one to one people became District Magistrates and sps in the country at this time and during the Emergency, he himself Months were hidden there
 nishchit rup se paswan ke is vaktavy se bhartiya janata party ke netaa or centre sarkaar main unke sahyogi khush nahin honge
 The comments lekin paswan ne kaha ki kisi sabha main jane se koi deshadrohi nahin ho jaataa
 But they also said that crossing the Lakshman Rekha is illegal
 lekin kanhaiya ke bare main unhone kaha ki ye jaanch kaa vishay he or is maamle kii puri jaanch honi chahie
 Ram Vilas Paswan while going on also said that he was in favor of the freedom of ideology but he also said that nationalism and secularism are not the same but separate
 paswan ke ye nape tule bol nishchit rup se chaunkaane vaale hai or khaskar rohit vemula ke mudde par unki chuppi lekin kanhaiya ke vishay par unka rukh saafe karata he ki wo is baat ko lekar nishcint hai ki centre sarakar or dilli police ke paas kanhaiya ke khilaaf koi aisa sakshya nahin hai jisase use rashtradroh ke maamle main doshi qaraar diya jaae
 And Paswan, who is resentful of the Dalit community, does not want to disappoint his supporters by remaining more silent
 jawaharlal nehru vishvidhyalay chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ke mudde par wo khul kar bhartiya janata party ke rukh se alag dikhe
 At a communist conference in Patna on Thursday, Ram Vilas Paswan said, 'we have our sympathies with Kanhaiya, belong to Bihar
 hamaari sahanubhuti he, wo jawan hai or nirvaachit adhyaksh hai
 ' paswan ne na keval kanhaiya ke saath khul kar sahanubhuti dikhaai balki jawahar laal nehru vishvidhyalay kii ho rahi aalochana par bhi apana rukh saafe karte hue kaha ki vahaan se ek se ek log is samay desh main jiladhikari or espi hue or apatkaal ke dauraan vah khud do maheene vahiin chhipe the
 Certainly Paswan's statement will not please the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and their allies in the central government
 tippaniyan But Paswan said that no one becomes a traitor by going to a meeting
 lekin unhone saath main yah bhi kaha ki lakshmana rekha ko paar karnaa gaiyr kanoonee he
 But about Kanhaiya, he said that this is the subject of investigation and the matter should be thoroughly investigated
 ramvilas paswan ne jate-jate ye bhi kah daalaa ki wo vichaardhaara kii svantrtaa ke pakshdhar hai lekin unhone ye bhi kaha ki rashtrawaad or dharmanirpekshata alag-alag nahin balki ek hi hai
 These simple words of Paswan are certainly shocking and especially his silence on the issue of Rohit Vemula but his stance on the subject of Kanhaiya makes it clear that he is convinced that the Center Sircar and Delhi Police have against Kanhaiya There is no evidence to hold him guilty of treason
 or dalit samudaay kii naaraazgi jhel rahe paswan or adhik maun rah kar apane samarthakon ko niraash nahin karnaa chaahate
 Paswan not only showed open sympathy with Kanhaiya but also clarified his stand on the criticism of Jawaharlal Nehru University, that from there one to one people became District Magistrates and sps in the country at this time and during the Emergency, he himself Months were hidden there

 So they thought that apart from the activities of people, plants also contribute to global warming
 aam taur par din main prakaash sanshleshan ke dauraan paudhe carbon-daai oxide grahan karte hai or raat main carbon daai-oxide chhodte hai
 But during photosynthesis, plants discard this gas in small quantities compared to the proportion in which carbon dioxide is absorbed

 The other accused have to be questioned face to face
 chidambaram jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 The CBI says that Chidambaram did not provide the complete documents, even after repeatedly saying that the documents were not made available
 sibiai ne court ko hoicourt kaa aadesh saunpa
 The CBI told the court that "the high court has rejected the anticipatory bail
" is cese main chargeshit abhi fil nahin hui he
 We are on the pre charge sheet stage, we are waiting for some documents
 aaropee sawaalon se bachataa rahaa he
 They need custodial interrogation

 It has a complete money trail
 philhal sibiai kii daleelein puri ho chuki he
 On behalf of p Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal said in court, the accused in this case are Karthi, who has been awarded bail on 23 March 2018

 From the High Court Judgment, it appears that a draft charge sheet has been prepared

 chidambaram se sibiai ne abhi tak sirf ek baar poochtacha kii
 Chidambaram never ran away from questioning
 agar chidambaram sawaalon se batch rahe hai to sibiai un sari baton ko court main rakhe
 Kapil Sibal said before the court, 12 questions were asked to Chidambaram, out of which 6 have been answered by Chidambaram in the previous inquiry
 kal arest hone se lekar aaj 11 baje tak sibiai ne koi poochtacha nahin kii, jabaki chidambaram ne baar-baar poochtacha ke liye kaha
 This case is based on documents
 agar paisa mila he to wo kisi acount main gaya hoga, wo koun sa acount he, kisne paisa diya, kab diya? 5 million dollar kahaan par diya gaya? sibbal ne jaj se kaha ki cese diary main dekh lijie agar aisa kahin kuch likhaa he to
 Kapil Sibal said in the debate, the questions that were asked earlier are being asked again
 in logon ne ek baar poochtacha ke baad dubaara lambey samay tak poochtacha kyon nahi kii
 The anticipatory bail order was hung for 7 months
 keval aaropon ke aadhaar par remand nahin di ja sakati
 After this Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued on behalf of Chidambaram
 unhone kaha, jin 6 sachivon ne jo FIPB kaa faisla liya unhen arest karne kii koshish bhi nahin hui, kyonki wo public life main nahin he
 Indrani Mukherjee made a statement in court in February 2018, this lady (indrani Mukherjee) became a government witness in June 2019
 14 maheene tak poochtacha ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya or ab ye giraftaar kar rahe he
 Is there any evidence to become a government witness? Can he be arrested on the basis of that? The judge asked, when was the summons issued to Chidambaram? Singhvi said, in June 2018
 aapako wo jawaab nahin mil rahaa jo aap sunanaa chaahate he
 Then the judge said, he will give whatever is the answer
 singhvi bole chidambaram wo jawaab nahin denge jo sibiai sunanaa chaahati he
 Singhvi further said in this debate, Mehta has sought remand but has not made any allegations against him
 ye bataaen aarope kya hai? is mukademe main sibiai kaa sara approach hi galat he
 No triple risk from Chidambaram, flight risk, to run away, to impress witnesses and to erase evidence
 ye castady dene ke laayak majboot cese nahin he
 There was also a heated argument between CBI lawyers Tushar Mehta, Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi regarding the remand
 6 june 2018 ke baad is cese main koi deveopment nahin hua
 CBI lawyer Tushar Mehta said again, those who know Chidambaram are not telling
 is par chidambaram ne kuch kehane kii koshish kii, lekin sibiai ke vakil ne roka
 Mehta said that 2 lawyers are already arguing in the court
 sibiai kii taraf se tushaar mehta ne kaha, gambhir frod kii jaanch main kisi nattejey tak pahunchane tak samay lagata he
 On 20 June 2018, new facts emerged
 iske turant baad chidambaram ko hoicourt se raahat mil gayi
 Even after arresting them, questions are still avoided
 hoicourt kaa bhi maananaa tha ki ye bel dene ke laayak nahin he
 We cannot reach the truth without custodial interrogation
 ham jaanch kii baaten public main nahin bataa sakate
 Chidambaram wanted to present his stand, but the CBI protested and said that this would be a wrong tradition
 chidambaram ne kaha, ''maine har sawaal kaa jabaab diya or na hi mainen paisa liya
 i have given information of my son's account abroad to CBI
 meraa koi acount videsh main nahin he

 US President Donald Trump removed his NSA, upset by John Bolton's aggressive policy
 trump-iran-north Korea issue on both sides sparked relationship with Thiran, embroiled in many major problems in the world including trade war with China on Tuesday
 Political upsurge occurred
 raashtrapati donald trump ne apane rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (NSA) jon bolton ko barkhaast kar diya or jald hi nae NSA ke elaan kii baat kahi
 Trump tweeted Bolton's dismissal in two tweets and made it clear that his and John Bolton's policies did not match
 jon bolton kii ginati america ke un naukarshahon main hoti he, jo apni niti ko lagu karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 Then even if it is about war
 iran, north korea, afghanistan main america kaa sakht rukh unki hi dein he or inhen ke chalate unke or donald trump ke bich vivaad hua or antat: unhen pad chhodana padaa
 Click and read this news: Trump's tweets that brought the world the biggest breaking newsjohn Bolton has been a supporter of the Republican Party since the age of 15, and Bolton attended the school for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater (1964) Was promoted
 uske baad se hi vah lagaataar is party ke liye kaam karte rahe or pichley 2-3 dashakon se nitigat faislon kaa hissaa rahe
 His policy has always been aggressive, who are in favor of change of power in many countries, ready for war from any country
 jon bolton kii aakraamak niti se jude kuch pahaluon par yahaan nazar daalen:- 1998 main jon bolton america kii agency new american centuri ke project diarector rahe hai, jinhone iran ke saath yuddh kaa samarthan kiya tha
 - Donald Trump has taken friendship steps with North Korea in the past, but John Bolton's policy is different
 bolton kaa maananaa rahaa he ki america ko bina deree kiye north korea par strike kerani chahie, nahin to vah khatra ban saktaa he
 In the past, when trump-kim Jong-un met, John Bolton's policy was behind it
 kyonki jon bolton ne north korea ke saamne kai kathin sharten rakh di thim
 - At present, there is talk about nuclear deal between Iran and America
 jon bolton kii iran ko lekar ek hi niti he agar vah naa maane to bam barasaa dene chahie
 Bolton's same policy led to Donald Trump removing his foreign minister Rex Tillerson
 is khabar ko clic kar padhein: koun hai jon bolton jinhen trump ne NSA ke pad se kiya barkhaast- jab baraak obama ne 2015 main iran ke saath parmaanu deal par baat kerani shuru kii thi, to jon bolton ne iskaa kaaphi virodh kiya tha
 And wrote in an article in the New York Times that the time has come to start action
 - 'sanyukt raashtra kii koi jarurat nahin he', ye maananaa tha jon bolton kaa
 When John Bolton was sent by George Bush to the UN as ambassador, he said in a speech that the world does not need UN, the world can show the direction when powerful countries come
 or america sabase taqatvar he
 Apart from these, there are many issues where John Bolton's policy has been very different
 bhale hi duniya donald trump ko aakraamak maanati ho, lekin jon bolton kahin aage hai
 If they do, they can get regime change in Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Cuba and North Korea, and if it is not so, they can fight for it

 (input from IANS) 2 ji spectrum aavanton ke moolyankan karne ke kaig ke taur tareekon ko gambhir rup se trutipurna qaraar dete hue sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki iske aavanton main koi ‘rajasav nuksaan’ nahin hua or ‘pehle aao, pehle paao’ kii telikam niti vaajapeyi sarkaar ne banaai thi
 Communications and Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters, "we are saddened by the methods adopted by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in evaluating the allocation of 2G spectrum and the revenue losses shown in it
 There is no basis
 ’kaig ne apni report main spectrum aavanton main 1
 76 lakh crore has shown a revenue loss but Sibal claimed that the taxpayers have not actually suffered any loss
 unhone kaha ki kaig kii report ke kaaran pehle sarkaar ko asahaj sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa or ab tathy saamne aane ke baad vipaksh vishesh taur par bhaajapa ko asahaj sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 He said that the telecom policy introduced in 1999 was actually introduced by a minority government led by Vajpayee, while former President Chandra Shekhar and Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray were opposed to it besides former President Narayanan
 lekin vaajapeyi ne is niti ko sahi qaraar diya tha
 Taking a dig at the main opposition party BJP, Sibal said, 'now we are following his policy
 76 lakh karod ke rajasav nuksaan kii baat kahi ja rahi he, jo vastav main janata ke bich bhram failaane kaa prayaas he
 The Minister said that in the 10th Plan document presented at the time of the NDA Government in December 2002, declaring the telecom sector as an infrastructure sector, it explained the nature of providing incentives and in this regard stressed not to make revenue earning as the main determinant
 i went
 lekin aaj bhaajapa apni hi niti kaa virodh karti dikh rahi he
 The CAG report showed a loss of Rs 1,76,645 crore to taxpayers in the allocation of 122 licenses in spectrum allocation and 35 dual-use technology licenses in 2007-08
 vipaksh is maamle kii sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) se jaanch karaane kii maang par adi he jiske kaaran sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main kaamkaaj thap rahaa tha
 Sibal said, "we have full respect for all the institutions but there is a serious flaw in the cag's assessment and it has no technical ilm
 ’unhone kaha ki 122 license 4
 4 were in the Mega Hertz range but the CAG estimated 6
 2 mega hertz ke tahat tha
 The CAG conducted the assessment in 2010 while the licenses were granted in 2008
 sibbal ne prashn kiya ki, 2010 ke mulya ke anuroop aap 2008 kaa akalan kaise kar sakate hai
 Similarly, it took one year for the license to be implemented
 unhone kaha, ‘agar ham sampoorn akalan ko vyavasthit dhang se karen to spectrum aavanton main kar daataaon ko koi rajasav nuksaan nahin hua
 The minister said that the main theme is how the rate of revenue share for licenses was reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent and later to 8 percent during the NDA rule
 isse kisko phayda mila, yahi prashn he
 41 licenses were issued during Ram Vilas Paswan's tenure as Communications Minister, 18 licenses during Pramod Mahajan's tenure and 26 licenses during Arun Shourie's tenure
 jabaki daayanidhi maaran ke kaarykaal main 25 license or e raja ke kaarykaal main 122 license jari hue
 Sibal said that the rate per call from mobile was Rs 32 in 1994, it has come down to Rs 16 in 1998-99, six rupees 70 paise in 2000 and today it has been 30 paise per call
 unhone kaha, ‘spectrum aavanton se kisko phayda hua yah sab logon ke saamne he or vipaksh kaa aarope niraadhaar he
 Due to spectrum allocation, people of Bihar, UP living in other areas of the country have benefited greatly and are getting up to Rs 1,200 monthly savings
 ’unhone kaha ki telikam kshetra se sarkaar ko 30 pratishat rajasav kii prapti ho rahi he
 This has greatly benefited the farmers and fishermen of every section of the society and the opposition 1
 76 lakh karod rupee ke rajasav nuksaan kii baat kar rahi he jo vastav main he hi nahin
 Sibal said, 'the CAG has done injustice to our (government), and the opposition is doing injustice to the common man
 kyonki isse aam aadmi ko phayda hua he

 '' There is a temple on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, where Mahadev darshan in two forms under one roof
 is mandir main do-do nandi bhi hai or wo bhi aamane-saamne
 It is said that whoever gets the good fortune to see these forms gets salvation
 ise mahadev kii mahima kahie, shiv kaa chamatkaar kahie yaa phirbholenathka vardaan
 In this temple built on the banks of Namarda, Mahadev darshan the devotees in not one but two forms
 gujarat main narmada ke kinare nadi ke tat par bana aughaddani kaa ye adbhut or chamatkaari mandir he
 Here Dhaneshwar calls one form of Mahadev and the other is called as Lukeshwar
 bataaya jaataa he ki dhaneshwar mahadev kisthapanaswayan kuber ne kii thi
 It is said that when Ravana snatched away the Lanka of gold from Kubera, then Kubera meditated on Lord Shiva to get him back
 bhole bhandari ke usee rup ko bhakt dhaneshwar ke naam se puujate hai
 Lukeshwar Mahadev Temple, which sits alongside Dhaneshwar Mahadev, is equally ancient
 vishnu ne dharaa stri rupapuranic katha ke mutabik, bhasmasur naamak daitya ne mahadev kii tapasya kar vardaan paaya tha ki jis par wo haath rakhega wo bhasma ho jayega
 After getting the boon, Bhasmasura once ran after Shiva, then fearing Bhasmasura, Mahadev Narmada hid in these bushes on the shore and then Lord Vishnu took a female form and put the hand of Bhasmasura on top of him
 bhasmasur apane hi vardaan se jalakar bhasma ho gaya or tabhi se bhole bhandari ko yahaan lukeshwar ke naam sepukara jane laga
 These two forms of Mahadev, Dhaneshwar and Lukeshwar Mahadev can be felt only after their arrival in the court
 ek taraf jahaan bhakt yahaan aakar mahadev ke anokhe rup ke darshan kar dhanya ho jate hai, vahiin bhakton kaa maananaa he ki yahaan aane se na keval unhen shanti milti he balki bhole bhandari sukhi jivan kaa vardaan bhi dete hai
 Even more important is that by coming here and providing food to Brahmins, devotees get rid of all types of Pitradosh
 mahadev ke is rup kii mahima or unkechamatkaaron kii charchadur dur tak faili hui he
 Disappointed devotees from every side come to Mahadev's court, they get so relaxed and relaxed that the devotees just stay here

 His claims and fighting style also won the hearts of the people of Delhi
 70 main se 67 vidhansabha siten jitkar ve rajya ke mukhyamantri to ban gaye, lekin beete sau dinon main unki raajnneetik aparipakvata or adiyal ravaiye se dilli main raajnneetik kudon kaa ambara lagata dikh rahaa he
 By the way, in addition to political garbage, garbage and garbage are also being spread in the streets and mohallas of Delhi due to the strike of the Municipal Corporation employees
 jis dilli ko kejariwal vishwastareey city banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai, uski vyavasthaaen ab charmarati dikh rahi hai
 The latest controversy is related to big leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party
 arvind kejariwal ne jin jitendra tomars ko kanoon mantri banaaya, ve kanoon ke shikanje main hai
 Accusations of fake degrees are being exposed layer by layer of their lies
 farji degree hasil karne kaa rog nayaa nahin he, lekin aam aadmi party jis shuchita kii baat karti rahi he, use pankchar karne ke liye kaaphi he
 The allegations against Tomar were already there, but Kejriwal never heeded those charges
 jab mantri mahoday giraftaar ho gaye, party or sarkaar kii fajihat ho gai tab aam aadmi party ne tomars par jaanch bithaane kaa faisla liya
 The problems of Somnath Bharti, who was the law minister in the previous government of Aam Aadmi Party, have also increased
 unki patni ne un par gharelu hinsa ke gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Although the question mark on the timing of the allegations of the wife definitely arises, but this does not reduce the charges against Somnath Bharti
 somnath bharti or unki patni bhi alag alag rahete hai, lekin is maamle ne bhi aam aadmi party kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 In both these cases of the party high command, the silence for a long time and the attempts to describe it as a conspiracy are also reducing the benefits and losses
 in do netaaon ke alaava aam aadmi ke do anya vidhayakon par halafname main farji degree dikhaane kaa aarope he
 The politics that Kejriwal has been claiming in the name of image has now come to dominate them
 vaise vivaadon kii shuruyaat to farvari main dilli kii sarkaar sanbhaalane kii baad hi shuru ho gai thi
 After coming to the government, the way Arvind Kejriwal showed the party's founding members Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav and Anand Kumar out of the party also damaged the party's image
 aam aadmi party ek chehre kii party main tabdeel hoti dikhi, jahaan haikaman kii chalati he
 The party recovered from this quarrel, before that a strange battle began between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor
 pehle kejariwal sarkaar, dilli police se anti karpshan beuro par adhikaar ke liye hoicourt gai
 After this, the deployment of Shakuntala Gamlin and Principal Secretary Anindo Majumdar as Chief Secretary was seen to escalate between the Delhi Government and the Deputy Governor
 majumdaar ke daftar main sarkaar kii taraf se taala lagava diya gaya
 The state government's dispute with the Deputy Governor increased so much that the Union Home Ministry had to issue a circular telling that Delhi is not a full state and what comes under the Governor's purview
 tippaniyan For the first time, there is so much tension between the Government of Delhi and the Deputy Governor
 kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad die apane pehle saakshaatkaar main (jo unhone enditivi ko diya tha) main najeeb jang par kaaphi vyaktigat hamale bhi kiye
 Though these issues could be resolved through negotiation intelligently, it appears that Kejriwal wants to create an image of himself suffering from the central government
 is chhavi se unhen or unki raajnneeti ko phayda bhale ho, lekin dilli kii janata ko kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the government of Arvind Kejriwal also issued a circular to curb the media, indicating a kind of dictatorship
 aise main ab dilli main faile kooday ko lekar ek baar phir kya kejariwal sarkaar apni raajnneetik naasamajh kaa parichay dekar is masale ko bhi apane liye nai mushkil banaati dikh rahi he
 However, the need is that the Delhi government should work with a cold head and avoid charges and counter-allegations to create this trust among the public, for which it has got a strong majority
 vaise, raajnneetik kudon ke alaava dilli nagar nigam ke karmchaariyon kii hadtaal ke chalate dilli kii sadakon or mohallon main kooda-kachra bhi failata ja rahaa he
 The arrangements of Delhi, which Kejriwal is claiming to be a world-class city, are now seen creaking
 taaja vivaad aam aadmi party ke bade netaaon se judaa he
 Jitendra Tomar, who was made law minister by Arvind Kejriwal, is in the grip of law
 farji degree ke aarope main unke jhooth kii parat-dar-parat khulti ja rahi he
 The disease of obtaining a fake degree is not new, but the purity of which the Aam Aadmi Party has been talking about is enough to puncture it
 tomars par aarope pehle se the, lekin kejariwal ne un aaropon ko kabhi tavajjo nahin di
 When the Minister was arrested, the party and the government were troubled, then the Aam Aadmi Party decided to put an inquiry on Tomar
 aam aadmi party kii pichhali sarkaar main kanoon mantri rahe somnath bharti kii mushkilen bhi bad gai hai
 His wife has made serious allegations of domestic violence against him
 haalanki patni ke aaropon kii timming par sawalia nishaan jarur uthta he, lekin isse somnath bharti par lage aarope kamatar nahin ho jate hai
 Somnath Bharti and his wife also live separately, but this case has also damaged the image of the Aam Aadmi Party
 party haikaman kii in donon maamalon main kaaphi samay tak chuppi or ise sajeesh bataane kii koshishon se bhi phayda kam, nuksaan zyada ho rahaa he
 Apart from these two leaders, two other mlas of the common man are accused of showing fake degrees in the affidavit
 image ke naam par jis raajnneeti kaa kejariwal daawa karte rahe hai, ab vah un par baari padane laga he
 However, disputes started only after the Delhi government took over in February
 sarkaar main aane ke baad arvind kejariwal ne jis tarah se party ke sansthaapak sadasyon prashanth bhushan, yogendra yadav or anand kumaar ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya, usase bhi party kii chhavi ko nuksaan hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party was seen turning into a face party where the high command runs
 is jhagade se party ubarti, usase pehle dilli sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich ajeeb si jang shuru ho gai
 First the Kejriwal government went to the High Court seeking authority over the Anti Corruption Bureau from the Delhi Police
 iske baad mukhya sachiv ke taur par shakuntla gamelin or pramukh sachiv anindo majumdaar kii tainaati par dilli sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich tanatani dikhne ko mili
 Majumdar's office was locked by the government
 rajya sarkaar kaa up rajyapal se vivaad itnaa badha ki kendriya grih mantralay ko circular jari kar bataanaa padaa ki dilli purna rajya nahin he or yahaan rajyapal ke daayre main kya-kya aata he
 The comments pehali baar dilli kii sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich itani tanatani dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Kejriwal, in his first interview after becoming Chief Minister (which he gave to NDTV), also made a lot of personal attacks on Najeeb Jung
 haalanki in muddon ko samajhadaari se baatcheet ke jariye suljhaayaa ja saktaa tha, lekin aisa prathit hota he ki kejariwal khud kii chhavi centre sarkaar se peedit mukhyamantri kii bananaa chaahate hai
 This image may benefit him and his politics, but the people of Delhi are suffering in terms of their work
 itnaa nahin, arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ne media par ankush lagane ke liye circular jari karke bhi ek tarah kii taanaashaahee kaa sanket diya
 In such a situation, now Kejriwal government is looking to make this issue even more difficult for itself by showing its political senselessness once again about the garbage spread in Delhi
 haalanki jarurat is baat kii he ki dilli sarkaar thande dimag se kaam kar aarope-pratyarope se bachakar janata ke bich ye bharosa paidaa kare, jiske liye use prachand bahumat mila he

 haalanki in muddon ko samajhadaari se baatcheet ke jariye suljhaayaa ja saktaa tha, lekin aisa prathit hota he ki kejariwal khud kii chhavi centre sarkaar se peedit mukhyamantri kii bananaa chaahate hai
 This image may benefit him and his politics, but the people of Delhi are suffering in terms of their work
 itnaa nahin, arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ne media par ankush lagane ke liye circular jari karke bhi ek tarah kii taanaashaahee kaa sanket diya
 In such a situation, now Kejriwal government is looking to make this issue even more difficult for itself by showing its political senselessness once again about the garbage spread in Delhi
 haalanki jarurat is baat kii he ki dilli sarkaar thande dimag se kaam kar aarope-pratyarope se bachakar janata ke bich ye bharosa paidaa kare, jiske liye use prachand bahumat mila he
 In both these cases of the party high command, the silence for a long time and the attempts to describe it as a conspiracy are also reducing the benefits and losses
 in do netaaon ke alaava aam aadmi ke do anya vidhayakon par halafname main farji degree dikhaane kaa aarope he
 The politics that Kejriwal has been claiming in the name of image has now come to dominate them
 vaise vivaadon kii shuruyaat to farvari main dilli kii sarkaar sanbhaalane kii baad hi shuru ho gai thi
 After coming to the government, the way Arvind Kejriwal showed the party's founding members Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav and Anand Kumar out of the party also damaged the party's image
 aam aadmi party ek chehre kii party main tabdeel hoti dikhi, jahaan haikaman kii chalati he
 The party recovered from this quarrel, before that a strange battle began between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor
 pehle kejariwal sarkaar, dilli police se anti karpshan beuro par adhikaar ke liye hoicourt gai
 After this, the deployment of Shakuntala Gamlin and Principal Secretary Anindo Majumdar as Chief Secretary was seen to escalate between the Delhi Government and the Deputy Governor
 majumdaar ke daftar main sarkaar kii taraf se taala lagava diya gaya
 The state government's dispute with the Deputy Governor increased so much that the Union Home Ministry had to issue a circular telling that Delhi is not a full state and what comes under the Governor's purview
 tippaniyan For the first time, there is so much tension between the Government of Delhi and the Deputy Governor
 kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad die apane pehle saakshaatkaar main (jo unhone enditivi ko diya tha) main najeeb jang par kaaphi vyaktigat hamale bhi kiye
 Though these issues could be resolved through negotiation intelligently, it appears that Kejriwal wants to create an image of himself suffering from the central government
 is chhavi se unhen or unki raajnneeti ko phayda bhale ho, lekin dilli kii janata ko kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the government of Arvind Kejriwal also issued a circular to curb the media, indicating a kind of dictatorship
 aise main ab dilli main faile kooday ko lekar ek baar phir kya kejariwal sarkaar apni raajnneetik naasamajh kaa parichay dekar is masale ko bhi apane liye nai mushkil banaati dikh rahi he
 However, the need is that the Delhi government should work with a cold head and avoid charges and counter-allegations to create this trust among the public, for which it has got a strong majority

 In real life our soldiers do not get any second chance or retake
 lekin shooting ke dauraan unhone in sari chizon kaa anubhav kiya
 The opportunity was to shoot JP Dutta's new film Paltan
 datta ne apni is film kii do maheene kii shooting kaa shedul ladakh scouts ke sainikon ke saath 15 november ko ladakh main puraa kiya
 This type of shooting in the outdoor is not easy for any manufacturer because they have to prepare for it almost the same way as the army to go to the border
 kalakaaron or unit kii team ke saath shooting main istemaal hone vaale baari-bharkam or atyaadhunik upkarnon ko mumbai se dhokar lokation par le jaaya jaataa he or is kaam ko line producers bakhubi nibhaate hai
 For the shooting of Dutta's film Paltan in Ladakh easily, the film's line producer Odpal Dzor George had taken full responsibility for the cause
 jorge kehete hai, ''1962 ke bharat-china yuddh par aadhaarit film palaton ke nirmaan main raksha mantralay sahyog kar rahaa he
 Because of this, he had complete control during the shooting
 film main ladakh scouts ke hi sainik or unki unifarm istemaal kii gai he
 "the line producer is the first person in a unit of any film to rid the producer of all the trouble of outdoor shooting and thereby reduces the headache of the production house
 jorge datta kii elosi kargil film ke nirmaan ke dauraan pehali dfa unase jude the
 Now Datta remembers George whenever he has to shoot his film in Ladakh
 jorge kaa maananaa he ki yuddh vaali filmon ko lekar raksha mantralay kaa rukh khaasaa sakaaratmak rahata he
 George has so far taken up the position of line producer while shooting over 20 films
 inamen datta kii filmon ke alaava rajkumaar hiraani kii thri idiyats, omprakash mehara kii mijrya or bhaag milkha bhaag or vipul shah kii vakt jaisi filmein shaamil hai
 His job as a line producer is to get legal permission for outdoor shooting, locating locations, arranging the necessary equipment, meeting the needs of the local people in the film, lodging and eating arrangements of the unit, etc
 yah sab karte hue bajet par najar gadaaye rakhni padati he
 It is obvious that the line producer cannot work for any one production house
 unka kaam freelansar kii tarah hota he
 a successful line producer is said to be the one who is well versed in the technical and locations of legal permission in addition to the best management
 iskaa koi aisa aupchaarik course bhi nahin hota ki jisase is kaam kii baarikiyaan pataa chal jaaen

 But social organizations and family members of Peer Khan, say that the names of 6 officials of Hindu organizations, who were mentioned by Peer Khan, have not yet been caught at the behest of the government
 ab sibisiaidi ne bhi unhen sarkaar ke ishaare par klanchit di he
 The CBCID did not consider those involved in the FIR as accused
 sibisiaidi ne is baat ko lekar tark diya ki ghatana ke vakt unki mobile lokation ghatana sthal se 4 kimi
 Is coming far away
 ghatnasthal par marpet ke video main sabhi 6 aaropee nahin dikh rahe hai
 Witnesses have also not confirmed their being on the spot
 jabaki nae aaropee banaae gaye do logon samet baaki ke saat aaropee ghatana sthal par video main marpet karte dikh rahe hai
 His presence there has also been confirmed by the witnesses present on the spot
 isse pehle exiaar main darj logon ko giraftaar karne se manaa karte hue police ne tark diya tha ki jab pahalu khan is ilaake kaa nahin tha to use marpet karte vakt sabhi kaa naam kaise pataa chal gaya or kaise yaad rahaa
 Aspect Khan's condition was not such that he knew the names and addresses of all the people at unknown places
 kisi sthaneey vyakti ne jaanboojhkar un 6 logon ke naam exiaar main darj karwaae the
 By arresting them, the whole case would be weakened because these people were not present on the spot
 jo log marpet karte video main dikh rahe the
 All the accused would have survived due to none of them being named in the FIR
 alvar ke ramgarh se vidhayak gyandev ahuja kaa kahana he ki jin logon kaa namefiaramen he, wo us vakt vahaan the hi nahin
 The first three vehicles were caught
 uske liye unhone police ko phone kiya tha
 Those people took him to Goshala
 ye log samajasevak hai
 Goshala also has his photo with ASI
 in 6 namjad logon ko clinit dene ke maamle main police ne bhi sibisiaidi kii jaanch ko sahi tehraaya he
 And has described the investigation as completely transparent
 udhar, grahamantri gulab chand kataaria ne kaha ki ham police kii jaanch par sawaal nahin uthaa sakate hai

 Former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is no longer among us
 jetali ke nidhan se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko bada jhatka laga he kyonki jetali ke kad kaa netaa party ne kho diya he
 After 2014, the way BJP came to the front foot in the politics of the country, Jaitley's strategy was the most important
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or grahamantri amit shah ko har siyaasi tufaan se bachaane vaale bhi jetali hi the
 In the present-day political era, the modi-shah duo is not far off
 aise main jetali kaa alavida kah dena party ke saath modi-shah ke liye bada nuksaan he
 The Lok Sabha elections were lost, but Jaitleyarun Jaitley, who was an outspoken leader of the stage, was always elected from the Rajya Sabha but lost his stature in the party
 party kii nitiyon or vichaardhaara ko vah kisi bhi manch se mukhar hokar rakhte the
 Despite losing the Lok Sabha elections despite the Modi wave in 2014, Jaitley found a department like the Finance Ministry
 unhone jo kaam kiye use party aage bhi bhunaati rahegi
 The decision of demonetisation and GST was taken while Jaitley was the Finance Minister
 in do faislon kii jab bhi charchaa hogi jetali ko yaad kiya jayega
 modi-shah's support in crisis Arun Jaitley supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah when he was forced out of Gujarat
 is dauraan amit shah jetali ke saath aksar dekhe jate the
 After the Gujarat riots, Jaitley also took over the responsibility of resolving the legal problems of the then CM Narendra Modi
 party main bhi modi ke khilaaf tikhe hamale ho rahe the, us dauraan bhi jetali ne modi kaa hi saath diya
 Jaitley had persuaded the party's biggies to make Modi the bjp's prime ministerial candidate in 2014
 iske liye jetali ne rajnath singh, shivaraj singh chouhan or nitin gadakari ko saath laane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley passed away, here Shraddhanjalitin came out openly on divorce, Arun Jaitley was the one who initiated the Jaitleetin divorce case
 is bade mudde par sarkaar kii sthiti jetali ne hi spasht kii thi
 The Modi government had been trying to get the triple talaq bill passed since coming to power for the first time
 rajyasabha ke baad 30 july 2019 ko yah bill loksabhaa se bhi paas ho gaya tha
 Considered bjp's brain, Arun Jaitley was made Minister of State in the Ministry of Law and Justice, Information and Broadcasting and Disinvestment in the Vajpayee government
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke sabase bharosemand logon main se jetali ek the
 At that time, only Arun Jaitley and Anant Kumar were considered to be the brain of the BJP
 haalanki ab party ke paas donon hi netaa nahin hai

 He was the first among the 24 mps who campaigned for the removal of Rao after being badly defeated in the 1996 elections and urged Sonia to make him the party president
 ve garv ke saath nehru-gandhi parivaar ke prati apni bhakthi kaa pradarshan karte hai
 "I am here to implement the strategies and programs formulated by Sonia Gandhi," he proclaims
 ”66 varshiya bhupinder singh hooda congress ke sabase prabhaavshaalee mukhyamantri ke rup main ubhare hai
 But not only because of being close to the Gandhi family, but because of the efficient exploitation of Haryana's only 'natural resource' (the precious land area adjacent to Delhi whose demand never ends) has become inevitable
 saatven dashak ke madhya main apane hometown rohtak main vakaalat shuru karne vaale hooda ne raajnneeti main achaanak pravesh kiya or parde ke peeche se chupchaap kaam karte rahe
 His footsteps in the path of politics were noticed by few people
 ve kehete hai ki 1982 main raajnneeti main unka pravesh paariwarik faisla tha
 In his words, "A full-time politician was always present at home
" pehle, mere dadaji choudhary matu ram or phir mere pita choudhary ranbir singh
 This career move opened the doors to success
 2005 ke march main sonia ne rajya main congress ko shandaar jeet dilaane vaale or shirrsh pad ke daavedaar bhajanlaal ko khaarij kar hooda kii vafadari ko saraahte hue unhen haryana kaa mukhyamantri bana diya
 Since then, in these eight-nine years, Hooda used the sharp edge of politics he had learned during four consecutive terms in the Lok Sabha, taking full advantage of new opportunities by surprising the opponents in his state and his support in the All India Congress Committee Kept up
 dilli ke copernicus maarg par haryana bhawan kii pehali manzil par mukhyamantri kaa bhavy kaksh kisi korporate mukhyalay or rajnatik offis kaa khubasurat mail najar aata he
 People waiting for a two-and-a-half minute meeting with CM Sahaba, from administrative officials, leaders dressed in Khadi to business executives and builders sitting with their colleagues, are also seen
 isi bich hooda apane kaksh se bhi bhavy conference room main baithkar kuchhek 'atyant jaruri’ meeting nibataate hai or aakhirkaar baahar aate hai
 Everyone stands up
 hooda ke chehre par muskaan saji he
 They are apparently unaware of the recent allegations that Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi, involved in suspicious land transactions and large construction companies were unfairly benefited
 unka kahana he, ''yah (wadra- dlef vivaadaaspad sauda or anya bhoomi ghotaalon par iees adhikari ashok khemka kii report se uthaa aaropon kaa tufaan) saraasar bakawaas he
 "they insist that" one inch of land "has not been given directly to developers since he became chief minister in 2005
 krishi bhoomi ko commercial or awasaiya pariyojnaon main istemaal ke liye manjuuri dete samay 1975 kii bhoomi license niti kaa paalan kiya gaya
 He says his political rivals like Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh, who are seeking an inquiry into all other land deals in the district, including the vadra-dlf deal, have also benefited from this policy
 unke shabdon main, ''khud inderjeet ko 83 acre jameen ke liye license mila he
 Inderjeet is refusing to give any response, saying that he does not want to get involved in further controversies
 kaha ja rahaa he ki unhen congress netritv ne chetaya he ki hooda kii nitiyon kii aalochana na karen
 Hooda has felt reluctant that his government has been very liberal in granting licenses
 ve kehete hai, ''haryana main koi prakritik sansaadhan nahin, par ise sabase zyada phayda is baat se ho rahaa he ki isaki seemaa teen taraf se dilli se satee he
 This gives the people of Haryana a better price for their land and the government finds a way to woo investors
 ”lekin is par vichaar karen: 1981 se haryana main aane vaali sarkaron ne 30,418
 Licensed for 65 acres of land
 isamen se 22,000 acre jameen bilders ke paksh main gai
 Since March 2005, this land allegedly went under the supervision of Hooda in the bag of builder companions or special friends like Vadra
 rajya ke toun and country planning department se mili aankadon se pataa chalaa he ki hooda har saal 2,732
 16 acres of agricultural land have been approved for commercial and residential use
 yah chah purvavarti mukhyamantriyon—devilal, bhajanlaal, bansilaal; antarim mukhyamantri hukum singh or banarsi das gupta or omprakash chautaala—ke kaarykaal ke dauraan di jane vaali 356
 72 acres is eight times more than the land
 ve is aalochana ko anuchit tehraate hai
 "I have provided economic value to the farmers' land
 ” floor daron ko niyat karne ke unki sarkaar ke faisle se jameen kii keemton main oochaal aa gaya he
 During Chautala's tenure (2005), farmers were given Rs 1 lakh per acre of land
 ke mukaable main unhen prati acre 1 karod ru
 Could get it done
 ”hooda 135 kimi kii kundali-manesar-palaval express-ve ke liye die gaye muaavje kaa zikr karte hue samajhate hai ki chautaala sarkaar ne adhigrahan kii keemat 160 karod ru
 While we had planted Rs 650 crore to the owners of the land
 dilwaaye
 "hooda says that fixing the floor rate has also benefited such pieces of land which are not important in commercial or residential places
 panchakula, ambala, asaandh, rewadi, bahadurgard, bhivani, kurukshetra, kaithal, karnal, palaval, sirsa or yamunanagar jaise ''anchhue ilaakon” main ho rahi nirmaan pariyojnaon kii ore ishaara karte hue ve kehete hai ki ''gudgaanv ke baahar kareeb 13,000 acre jameen ko license diya gaya he
 "with a face of complacency, he says," Haryana has undergone rapid urbanization in the last eight-nine years compared to Delhi
 ”lekin unke pratidwandvi or sahyogi, donon maanate hai ki atyant lubhaavni bhoomi license niti ne jahaan bhoomi se jude kareeb sabhi logon ko phayda pahunchaaya he, vahiin haryana ke mukhyamantri kii jholii main unke kisi bhi duusare mukhyamantri se zyada phayda udela he
 Its short-sightedness was seen in the grand hosting of Hooda during the Congress Executive Committee meeting held in Surajkund in November 2012
 yah aisa mauka tha jise paane ke liye rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne ji jaan laga di thi
 Ahmad Patel, Sonia Gandhi's political secretary, even approved to hold a meeting in Jaipur
 hooda ne haryana ko dilli se najadik hone kaa hawala dekar ise behatar vikalp bataaya
 According to insiders, Hooda's ability to raise funds has made him the star of the Congress leadership
 mukhyamantri ke rup main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan ve gandhi parivaar ke or bhi kareeb aa gaye hai
 "as far as i know, he is the only Congress leader who can address Rahul Gandhi unabashedly," says a senior IAS officer who has seen Hooda's confidence and influence grow
 ”hooda kii takat ko lekar kisi ke man main us vakt koi shankaa nahin rah gai jab june main kendriya cabinet ke pherbadal main unhone haryana congress main apane pratidwandvi birendra singh ke cabinet mantri banane ke mansoobon par pani pher diya
 However, he insists, "I was not behind that
" main kabhi aisi gandi raajnneeti nahin karata
 "but his opponents say that Hooda is someone who does not take rest until the last nail in the political coffin of the opponents is hit
 unke ghar tak pahunch rakhane vaale karibiyon kaa kahana he ki hooda kuch khaas logon par hi bharosa karte hai or unamem gine-chune netaa, adhikari, vyapaaree or rohtak ke dinon ke unke chand dost hai
 One of his colleagues says that among such people, industrialist-leader and former Union Minister Vinod Sharma is at the top, whom Hooda "cannot say no"
 sharma ab bhi unke dost or rajnatik salaahkaar hai
 Like Sonia Gandhi, Hooda believes in offering loyalty
 apane bharosemand adhikariyon ko ritair hone ke baad ve mahatvapurn padon se navajte rahe hai
 For example, Chief Secretary of State P
W
 ke
 He gave Chaudhary an unusual extension of six months of service
 hooda ke pramukh sachiv chhattar singh bhi seva vistaar par chal rahe hai or uske baad ve upiessi ke sadsy ban jaaenge
 Hooda, who has been interested in playing tennis since the days of Kunjpura Sainik School, says that the time of the day is best for him when Jaydeep, a former Davis Cup player on the meadow at Chandigarh's Chief Minister's residence or at Delhi's Gymkhana Club Playing tennis with Mukherjee
 ve niyamit taur par ek ghanta tennis khelte hai
 "boris Becker came to India earlier this year," he says
 tab maine unke khilaaf dubles match khelaa tha
 "it is very fun to tell 'bhupi Hooda' of family friends about achievements related to family
" suniye jaraa: ''mere pita choudhary ranbir singh samvidhan sabha ke sabase kam umr ke sadsy the
 He was 33 then
 ve aath vidhansabhaon ke sadsy rahe or sambhavat: yah valrd record he
 "he recounts with great fervor how his grandfather Matu Ram filed an election petition in 1923 against the then Agriculture and Industry Minister of Punjab, Rai Bahadur Lal Chand, for Rs

 Lal Chand was the father of Raghavendra Singh, owner of DLF, a well-known real estate company
 is peedi main unke bete saansad deepender ko chhodkar unka koi kareebi rishtedaar raajnneeti main nahin he
 His elder brother Inder Singh looks after the family's property in Bajpur, Uttarakhand, while younger brother Dharmendra Singh takes care of his 95-year-old mother in Rohtak
 hooda khud ko narendra modi ke congressi sanskaran kii tarah pesh karte hai
 In his office, all the figures will always be ready to prove how his state is better on economic-social norms than Modi's Gujarat
 ve kehete bhi hai ki gujarat kii prati vyakti aay 75,115 ru
 While Haryana's Rs 1,09,227
 he
 He says, "we have achieved 192 per cent increase in resource mobilization in Haryana while Gujarat only 96
 5 fisadi par hi itaraa rahaa he
 We have far higher rates of honorarium, scholarship, minimum wages, MGNREGA wages and other remuneration
 kai maamalon main labhaarthiyon kii sankhya ke maamle main ham chaar guna aage hai
 Hooda passionately describes his relationship with Gujarat
 unhone paanchavin class ke chaatr ke taur par jamnagar ke sainik skool main shuruaati chand maheene bitaye the
 Then why is everyone talking about Modi? According to Hooda, it is because they are expert in showing, not by projections
