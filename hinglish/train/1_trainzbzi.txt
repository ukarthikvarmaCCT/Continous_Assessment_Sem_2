 Goods and Services Tax (GST) will come into effect from July 1
 iske baad stadium main jaakar cricket match dekhnaa mahangaa ho jayega
 Match tickets will be in the tax bracket of up to 28 percent
 khaskar ipel (indian premier lig) ke muqablon ke tikat par isaki sabase zyada maar hogi
 There was earlier a provision of 28 per cent tax on organizing sports organizations
 lekin guuruuvaar yani 29 june ko hui baithak main ise 18 fisadi karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 But here the government placed a condition
 18 fisadi kaa tex keval unheen maichon ke tikaton par lagegaa jahaan tikat kii keemat 250 rupee se kam hogi
 Since tickets are more than 250 in almost all the matches of cricket, especially in IPL matches, tickets are very high, so only 28% tax will be charged on them
 isi tarah hockey lig, kabddi lig, raceling lig jaise aayojanon ke mahange tikaton par bhi 28 fisadi tex vasula jayega
 However, hockey, football and other sports whose tickets are relatively cheap and tickets cost less than Rs 250 will be charged only 18 per cent tax
 yani yahaan darshakon ko zyada nuksaan nahin uthaanaa padegaa
 Cricket matches are completely full, especially during the IPL
 in maichon ke tikat bhi mahange hote hai
 In the last few years, the number of people watching the match has increased on the field
 aise main sarkaar ko laga ki yahaan se revenue kamaaya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, the government does not want to disappoint even the general sports fans, so the middle way was taken out and a tax of 18 per cent and 28 per cent tax was imposed on tickets priced below Rs 250

 das saal pehle pehali baar doorsanchaar ke kshetra main bhidane vaale bharat ke do sabase aakraamak or romaanchak udhyami mukesh ambani or sunil mittal ek baar phir 4ji ke kshetra main ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai
 Airtel launched India's first 4G service in Kolkata and Bangalore in May 2012
 abhi 4ji seva keval broadband or wireles data ke liye he
 It does not allow voice telephony
 4ji main 3ji ke mukaable lagbhag chauguni yaa 2ji se 16 guni zyada gati se data bheja ja saktaa he
 Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries may launch its 4G services across India in the second half of 2012
 ambani akavle aise oparator hai, jinhen 4ji sevaaon ke liye bharat ke sabhi 22 cirkilon main license mila he
 Bharti Airtel has a presence in eight major circles, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Kolkata
 kai visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki 4ji kii data sevaaon main hi telecom udyog kaa bhavishya he
 "in a country like India, where there are very few fixed line telephones, Internet services can only be spread through wireless broadband," says Mahesh Uppal, independent telecom consultant
 ''bharat main tej gati kii data sevaaon, khaskar video ke liye maang to he hi
 Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former telecom entrepreneur and Member of Parliament, says, "the penetration of cable and satellite TV is far less than mobile connectivity in India
" sambhaavna bhare is bazaar ke liye 4ji ekadam upyukt technology he
 "india has more than 800 million mobile subscribers, but television has a reach of only 45 million people
" video filon main bafring or dhimi gati se aplod hone jaisi dikkatein 4ji sevaaon main nahin hongi
 But other experts are not too optimistic about the prospects of income from 4G services
 swatantra doorsanchaar salaahkaar ravi vishweshwaraiya prasad kehete hai, ''bharat main doorsanchaar companiyon kii 85 pratishat aay dhwani sevaaon yani baatcheet se aati he
 Only 15 per cent of their income is from data services, including SMS
 '' prasad kaa maananaa he ki ambani or mittal ne 4ji ke aise vyapaar main kadam rakhaa he, jisamen jokhim zyada he kyonki aay ke strot zyada bade nahin hai
 But he says about Ambani's ambition that "the new initiator always gets an edge over the rest
" ''sarkaar ne jab june, 2010 main 4ji spectrum kii nilaamee kii, us samay na to ambani or na hi mittal ne ise zyada gambhirtha se liya
 Ambani entered the 4G sector soon after the auction by buying a 95 percent stake in Infotel, a company owned by Himachal Futuristics promoter Mahendra Nahata
 infotel akeli aisi company thi, jise puure bharat main sevaayen dene ke liye 4ji license 13,000 karod ru
 Found in less than
 ambani ne infotel kii hissedari kharidne ke liye 4,800 karod ru
 Paid
 bataaya jaataa he ki license kii rakam kaa bhugtan bhi unhone hi kiya
 Mittal's Airtel made about Rs 3,500 crore to get spectrum in four circles
 chukaaye
 In May 2012, Airtel bought a 49 per cent stake in Qualcomm's 4G arm for the Indian unit for Rs 1,000 crore
 se kuch kam main kharidi, jiske paas dilli, mumbai, haryana or kavral kii chaar aakarshak cirkilon main spectrum he
 This indicated that Mittal is going to get seriously into 4G
 mittal or mukesh ambani ke bich disambar 2002 or june, 2005 ke bich kii ek sankshipt avadhi main ladaai ho chuki he
 In December 2002, Mukesh Ambani launched Reliance Infocomm, his first venture after his father's death
 us samay ek press vijyapti main kaha gaya tha ki mukesh ambani ke netritv main reliance infocom ''bharat main ek digital kranti kii shuruyaat karegi
 Ambani landed in the region using CDMA technology, which upset all GSM operators including Mittal
 lekin mukesh ambani 2005 main doorsanchaar kshetra se alag ho gaye, jab vyapaar ke bantwaare ke tahat reliance infocom unhone apane bhai anil ambani ko saunp diya
 The battle of 2G and then 3G was left to Anil
 digital kranti kii paraten abhi saat saal baad bhi khul hi rahi hai
 And Mukesh Ambani once again stands at the forefront
 sambhav he ki 4ji sevaaon kaa ek bada aadhaar banane main samay lag jaae
 At the moment, the equipment available to offer 4G services is quite low
 uppal kehete hai, ''4ji kaa echosystem alag-alag frequency ke aadhaar par banta he
 Availability and price of these devices is still a challenge
 '' duniyabar main 4ji seva 2,500 megahertz ke band main di jaati he
 But in India, a frequency of 2,300 mhz has been given for this service
 lihaaja aaayaatit upkarnon ko bhartiya paristhitiyon main dhaalnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Chandrasekhar is not too worried about the ecosystem
 ve kehete hai, ''ek baar 4ji shuru ho jane ke baad echosystem apane-aap ban jayega
 In places where Bharti Airtel has started 4G services, it is still offering reasonably priced 4G tablets
 uppal ummid karte hai ki hardware nirmaataaon or 4ji seva companiyon ke bich majboot sambandh banenge
 4G services can be offered via tablets, dongles, (devices fitted with laptops) and computers
 reliance infocom ne 2002 main upabhoktaaon ko apni sevaaon ke prati aakarshith karne ke liye sidime handset kaaphi saste main beche the
 It is almost certain that Mukesh Ambani will follow a similar strategy to promote his 4G services
 aisi khabaren bhi aa rahi hai ki reliance khud hi upkarnon kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 It has also collaborated with Ericsson for 4G devices
 vahi oparator 4ji kii ladaai jitegaa, jo iske liye sabase sasta echosystem de paaegaa
 The battle will also depend on the content available from the 4G service company
 mukesh ambani ne raghav bahal ke tivi18 or network 18 main 1,700 karod ru
 The investment made by it was a conscious step to make inroads in the field of providing content
 telecom regulatory athurity of india (tri) kii siforeeshon ne bhi 4ji ke kshetra main ek nayaa mode laa diya he
 These recommendations were made by its former chairman J
 es
 Placed in April just before Sarma stepped down on 13 May
 tri ne suzav diya he ki spectrum ke istemaal ko udaar banaaya jaae, taaki 4ji kaa prayog wais telephoni ke liye bhi ho sake
 The government has not yet accepted this recommendation
 yah vivaadaaspad he kyonki 3ji ke mukaable 4ji spectrum behad sasta isi vajah se bechaa gaya ki 4ji kaa prayog wais telephoni ke liye karne kii anumati nahin thi
 Critics argue that the liberalization of spectrum in this way gives entry to new players from the backdoor in the telecom sector
 agar ye siforishein sweekaar kar lee gayi to mukesh ambani wais telephoni dene main mittal ke saath muqabla kar sakenge
 Both Mittal and Mukesh Ambani require that their 4G service be successful
 wais telephoni main galakat pratispardhaa ke chalate mittal ke munaafe par dabaav he
 The fact is that if trai's recommendations on the reforming of spectrum were accepted, they would get Rs 40,000 crore
 kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Ambani's oil and gas business is under unprecedented pressure from the Petroleum Ministry
 haalanki ambani ab bhi vittiya rup se majboot sabit ho sakate hai
 Reliance Industries Rs 1 lakh crore
 kii nakadi ke vishaal bhandar par baithi he
 But despite tough conditions, Mittal, who is making a profit, will compete fiercely
 isse upabhoktaaon ko sasti, tej or behatar gunvattta vaali sevaaon kaa laabh milegaa

 In the midst of the fierce protests in the Samajwadi Party, the era of man-spirit has started
 lakhanu main siem akhilesh yadav se milane ke baad party mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ne guruuvar ko kaha ki mukhyamantri ko bahari dakhal bardaasht nahin he
 He also said that some people take advantage of the simple nature of Netaji i
e
 Mulayam Singh Yadav
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko akhilesh yadav ne kaha tha ki maujuuda sankat ke liye parivaar se baahar kaa vyakti jimmedaar he
 Although Akhilesh did not name anyone, but it is understood that the target was on MP Amar Singh
 amar kii party main failaa raitamulaayam ke kunbe main jari ghamaasan akhilesh sarkaar ke do mantriyon or phir mukhya sachiv ke hataae jane ke baad shuru hua
 In the backdrop of this incident, some such things happened recently that hold Amar Singh responsible for this whole episode
 darasal, is pherbadal kii patakatha ravivaar raat amar singh kii ek party main likhi gai thi
 Apart from Mulayam Singh, Shivpal Singh and Chief Secretary Deepak Singhal also attended this party held at a five star hotel in New Delhi
 is party ke liye nyotaa to akhilesh ko bhi gaya tha lekin wo nahin aae the
 Amar Singh is heard a lot
 It is being said that during this party, Amar Singh told Mulayam Singh in the presence of Deepak Singhal that up's mining minister Gayatri Prajapati is on the CBI radar
 agar wo giraftaar hote hai to samaajawaadee party, pradesh sarkaar ormulaayam parivaarake liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban sakati he
 The next day, Mulayam invited Amar Singh and Deepak Singhal to his residence in Delhi
 mulaayam ke poochne par in donon ne raat kii baat doharaa di
 On this, Mulayam Singh asked Akhilesh to change the department of Gayatri Prajapati as well as Raj Kishore Singh
 akhilesh ne netaji ke kehane par kiye pherbadalamangalvaar ko gayatri prajapati ne netaji se milakar unhen yah samajhane kii koshish kii ki amar singh or deepak singhl kaa daawa bebuniyaad he
 Prajapati managed to convince Mulayam Singh about his innocence
 iske baad mulaayam singh ne deepak singhl ko mukhya sachiv ke pad se hataane ko kaha
 It is being told that Akhilesh was already angry with Singhal, so he immediately removed Singhal from the post of Chief Secretary and appointed his favorite officer Rahul Bhatnagar as the new Chief Secretary of the state
 akhilesh ne nahin suni netaji kii batmukhya sachiv ke pad se hataae jane se hairaan singhl mulaayam singh ke paas pahunche
 He said he had no opinion about the ministers and was only listening to Amar Singh
 amar singh ne bhi singhl ko behaal kiye jane kii apil netaji se kii
 At this Mulayam asked Akhilesh to restore both the ministers and Deepak Singhal again
 lekin akhilesh ne is baar pita kii baat nahin maani
 He explained to Mulayam that his move during the election season would send a wrong message
 mauka milte hi saadhaa nishanaamulaayam ne akhilesh ko manaane kii jimmedaari ramgopal ko saunpi lekin siem tus se mas nahin hue
 Angered by this, Mulayam snatched the post of state president from Akhilesh and handed it over to Shivpal
 siem ne palatwaar karte hue shivpal se saare ahm vibhaag chin liye
 In this way, Amar Singh's hand is being told in the politics of UP for the past 72 hours
 haalanki amar singh isse inkaar kar rahe hai ki akhilesh ne 'bahari' ke taur par unki ore hi ishaara kiya tha
 Akhilesh, who was against Amar's return, was also not happy about Amar Singh's return to the Akhilesh Samajwadi Party
 siyasat ke jaadugar kahe jane vaale amar singh kii sapa main vaapasi to ho gai, unke manachaahe kaam nahin ho paa rahe the
 Sanjeeda Akhilesh never allowed Amar Singh to dominate his image
 iskaa dard kabhi kabhi rajyasabha pad se istife kii dhamkee to kabhi party chhodane kii chetavanee ke rup main baar-baar dikh rahaa tha
 Although Amar Singh has been very close to Mulayam Singh Yadav but due to his close proximity to Shivpal, the path of his return to the party was cleared after six years and Rajya Sabha was also sent
 akhilesh kii tarah ramgopal bhi amar singh kii vaapasi ke khilaaf the
 Therefore, in this case, for the first time on Thursday, Amar Singh remained the target of Ram Gopal in front of the media
 amar ne tode kai ghar!amar singh ke bare negative yah he ki wo kisi kunbe main kalah daalane main maahir hai
 From Amitabh Bachchan to the Ambani family is an example of this
 amar singh ne apana varchasv badhaane ke liye shivpal se kareebi kaa phayda uthaaya or parde ke peeche se unke asantosh ko hawa dene main jute rahe
 Shivpalaka dissent is around four and a half years old when Netaji made Akhilesh the CM after the sp's victory in the assembly elections
 us vakt shivpal hi siem bananaa chaahate the

 ' Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N
 chandrababu naidu ne ravivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ‘‘khokhla'' vyakti qaraar diya, jinhone desh ke liye ‘‘kuch nahin'' kiya he
 He accused the Modi government of "refusing" to give special status to Andhra Pradesh despite promising it in Parliament
 naidu ne kaha ki modi ne 12 varsh mukhyamantri rahane ke baavjood apane grih rajya gujarat ke liye bhi kuch nahin kiya lekin har kisi ko vishwaas dilaa diya ki unhone ‘‘bade kaary'' kiye
 The Chief Minister said, "we all believed in it
 puure desh ne vishwaas kiya, lekin ve thage gaye
 He issued a white paper on the "implementation" of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014 and the "assurances related to it"
 jisamen mukhyat: pradhanmantri ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Naidu said, "we all trusted what Narendra Modi said

 Hollow lok janashakti party (lojpa) ke pramukh or rajyasabha sadsy ramvilas paswan ne ‘narendra modi prakaran’ main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke ravaie ko dabbu qaraar dete hue kaha he ki mukhyamantri kumaar yadi sachmuch alpsankhyakon ke hitaishi hai to ve naye halaat main bhaajapa se apane sambandhon ko tatkaal spasht karen
 Paswan said, 'BJP spokesman Balbir Punj has once again challenged Nitish's party by calling Narendra Modi worthy of the Prime Minister's post
 secular pradhanmantri kaa mudda chhedane vaale nitish kumaar kaa ravaiya dabbu kism kaa he
 If not, they should immediately clarify their party's relationship with the BJP
 ’purv kendriya mantri ne kaha, ‘modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke bare main bhaajapa or janata dal you ke bich tu-tu, main-man main bhaajapa ke varisht netaa maun hai
 It seems that he too is in favor of Modi
 aise main bihar mukhyamantri ko bataanaa chahie ki rajg ke saath unki party kaa kya rishta hoga
 Paswan has canceled his three-day show in Bihar
 unhone kaha, ‘main raashtrapati pad ke liye pranav mukherjee kii ummidavaari kaa prastaav karne vaale mukhya prastaavkon main hum
 i have to propose his candidature tomorrow so we have postponed our Bihar program
 ’unhone kaha ki nitish ne modi ko lekar jo raag chhedaa vah ‘gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main modi ke paksh main hawa banane main madad karne kaa kaam lagata he kyonki modi kii ranneeti matadaataaon ke dharmik aadhaar par dhruvikaran kii he
 'it is worth mentioning that the intense rhetoric between BJP and JDU has not stopped on Nitish Kumar's statement that' Only a secular leader can be the Prime Minister of India
 ’ yah tippanee karte samay nitish kumaar ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin liya tha par isse utpann sari bahes narendra maadi par kendrit he
 Modi has been in constant controversy since the Godhra incident of February 2002
 bhaajapa pravaktaa punj ne kal vadodara main kaha ki modi pradhanmantri pad ke kaabil hai or bhaajapa ne yah tay karne kaa theka kisi bahari vyakti ko nahin diya he ki uske bich dharmanirpeksh koun he
 The BJP and JD-U have advised their spokespersons to stay restrained in this matter, but after Punj's statement, JD-U president Sharad Yadav has publicly expressed his displeasure
 upi ke alag-alag ilaakon main prabhaav rakhane vaali choti raajnneetik partiyon ne aam aadmi party (aap) kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaayaa he
 Omprakash Rajbhar, convenor of the Ekta Manch, a front of seven smaller parties, has written a letter to Delhi CM and aap's prominent leader Arvind Kejriwal, saying that he wants to join them in their fight
 patr main rajbhar ne hawala diya he ki upi ke chunavi sangharsh main agar aap or ekta manch saath aa jaaen to upi main badi raajnneetik partiyon ko dhul chataayee ja sakati he
 Rajbhar says that Arvind Kejriwal had appealed for cooperation in the struggle against parties like bjp-congress-sp-bsp, after which i sent this letter to him
 lekin ab tak unki taraf se koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Ekta Manch fielded candidates for 91 seats in the last assembly election
 do siton par pratyaashee jite jabaki 32 siton par 25,000 se 49,000 tak vot mili
 In the February 2013 assembly by-election in Bhatpar Rani, the candidate of Ekta Manch got more votes than BJP and BSP
 vidhansabha chunaav ke samay ekta manch main do partiyaan bhartiya samaaj party or kaumi ekta dal thim, lekin ab parivartan dal, mahaan dal, janavaadee party, phulan sena or sarvajan vikaas party jud gaye hai
 Is there a difference between grains and grains? Probably not, but there is a difference between food made from grains and its price
 75 pratishat tak hota he
 The public has to arrange expensive thali at the market price, while the honorable ones sent by him to the highest temple of democracy get so much subsidy on the thali thali that they are fed up
 yadi artiai se maamla nahin khulata to na jane kab tak dakaar bhi nahin lete
 The rate card of the mp's plate is amazing
 Only members of Parliament who churn on kimhangai and subsidies make such a difference between themselves and the public
 aise main unase insaaf kii ummid kaise kii ja sakati he
 Of course, the truth that has been revealed is very bitter
 jahaan aam aadmi mahangi daal khaane ko majaboor he, vahiin saansadon ko mali madad kahen yaa sarkari imadad ki 13 rupee 11 paise laagat vaali frid daal keval 4 rupee main milti he
 Vegetables for just 5 rupees
 masala dosa 6 rupee main
 Fried fish and chips for 25 rupees
 matan katlet 18 rupee main
 Mutton curry for 20 rupees and 99
 04 rupee kii nonvej thali sirf 33 rupee main
 It is a matter of luck that if the government subsidy is added to the plate of mps, then the figure of help reaches at least 63 percent and maximum 75 percent
 is sach kaa doosraa pahalu bhi he
 The gas needed by the common man has now gone into the quota system
 salbhar main keval 12 sarkari imadad vaale silendar ek parivaar ke liye hai
 There were also populist advertisements, inspiring speeches by the Prime Minister and a request to leave government subsidies
 yakeenan, yahi hindustan kii khaasiyat he ki avam itani bhavuk or meharbaan hui ki ek jatke main saadhe 5 lakh logon se zyada ne gas par sabsidi chhod di or isse sarkaar par 102
 The burden of 3 crores was reduced
 kya kabhi saansad apanaayenge sabsidi chhodane kii muhimsbsidi chhodane kii muhim chalani bhi chahie
 It is inevitable over time and also necessary for the development of the country
 sawaal bas ek hi he ki jab hamaara sabase bada numaayinda hi 100 rupee kaa khaanaa 25 rupee main khaane par sharmida nahin he, jise pagaar or duusare bhatton ke jariye har mahinededh lakh rupee se zyaadaki aamadani hoti he, to ausat aay vaale gas upabhokta, jinamein dihadi majdoor or jhopad pattee main rahane vaale garib bhi hai, sabsidi chhodane kii apil beja nahin lagati
 After the RTI disclosure, when the debate on it was reached, the matter reached the 'kicking on the stomach' of the honorable people
 sansad kii khaadya maamalon kii samiti ke adhyaksh jitendra reddy ne sabsidi hataane kii sambhaavna ko khaarij kar diya or kaha, 'meri nani kahati thi ki kisi ke pet par laat nahin maarani chahie
 'the debate will end as a matter of concern,' Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Venkaiah Naidu seems to be the subject of a good debate, but he says that the decision is not just for two-four people, it will be considered if the matter comes
 kuch saansad bhalmansahat main yah bhi kah gaye ki ham sabsidi chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 It is also to be noted here that for the first time on 2 March this year, Narendra Modi, as a Prime Minister, had a meal in the canteen of Parliament for only Rs 29 and wrote 'annadata Sukhi Bhava' in the visitor's book
 ho saktaa he, unhen khyal na aayaa ho, varanaa sansad kii canteen kii sabsidi khatm karne kii behatar pahal usee samay shuru ho sakati thi
 14 crore 9 lakhs to the cantons of Parliament in the year 2013-14, 10 in the year 2009-10
 46 rupee or 2011-12 main 12
 a subsidy of Rs 52 crore was given
 in canteenon main saansadon ke alaava kareeb 4000 karmchaaree bhi khate hai, jinamein 85 se 90 fisadi iskar daata hai
 Are you really mps? After the RTI revelations of the real needy Subhash Aggarwal, it has now become a hotly debated issue
 21 july se shuru hone vaale sansad ke monsoon satr main mananeeyon kii thali jarur bahes kaa mudda banegi
 There should also be debate
 sawaal bas itnaa he ki kya is par vichaar hoga kisarkaari imadadke liye bina bhedbhaav nai or spasht lakshmana rekha banaai jaae or deshbhar main tamaam mahakamon, sansthaaon or iske asli hakdaar kaa saarvajanik taur par khulaasa ho or khajaane par padane vaale boj kaa phayda keval jarurat mandon ko hi mili
 May it not be that the hard earned money of the public as government servants is spent secretly on the good food of the honorable people, that too in crores every year

 Currently, there is no respite from the prices of petrol and diesel
 antarrashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemton main lagaataar aa rahi badhotaree ke chalate yah badhat jari he
 One liter petrol 80 in Mumbai on Monday
 10 rupee par pahunch gaya he
 At the same time, people here for diesel 67
 10 rupee chukaane pad rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the government has said that it is constantly trying to bring petrol and diesel under the purview of GST
 somvaar ko petrol kii keemten ek baar phir exise duty ghataae jane ke pehle ke str par pahunch gai hai
 Diesel has the same condition
 somvaar ko dilli main ek litrpetrol kii keemat72
 23 is the money
 oil ministar dharmendra pradhan ne kaha he ki sarkaar lagaataar petrol-dijal or kerosene ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kii koshish main juty hui he
 Efforts are being made for this; unhone ummid jataai kijiasti parishadjald hi isko lekar koi faisla le sakati he
 Regarding the ever-increasing prices of petrol and diesel, he said that international crude oil prices are increasing continuously
 duusari taraf, rajyon kii taraf se vasule jane vaale waite kii vajah se bhi keemten lagaataar badhati ja rahi hai
 If petrol and diesel are brought under the purview of the GST, then the prices of these two can come under 50 rupees
 isse kendriya str par lagane vaali exise duty or rajyon kii taraf se vasule jane waalo waite se aam aadmi ko chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Under GST, the council can impose a maximum of 28 per cent GST on it
 iske saath hi ye bhi sambhav he ki sarkaar kuch extra ses bhi iske saath lagaae
 However, no consensus has been reached about this at the moment
 isse bhale hiaam aadmi ko rahatamile, lekin rajyon ko isse rajasav main bada nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 This is the reason that all states are taking time to give their consent for this
 aise main agar petrol or dijal ko jiesti main laayaa jayega, to unki kamai main badi katautee hogi jiskaa centre sarkaar ko kahin duusari jagah se intjaam karnaa hoga
 However, Narendra Taneja says that if petrol and diesel come under GST, then the general public can get a relief of Rs 10 to 15 per liter
 vitt mantri arun jetali negiasti parishadki baithak ke baad bataaya ki bhale hi sabhi rajya philhal iske liye raji nahin hai, lekin congress petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane ke liye taiyaar he
 This will make the path a little easier
 unhone ummid jataai ki parishad kii agali baithak main isko lekar koi faisla ho saktaa he

 The political stir in Bihar is intensifying
 mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ke din lad chuke hai or nitish ek baar phir bijepi ke saath milakar rajya main sarkaar bana chuke hai
 On Wednesday evening, Nitish Kumar submitted his resignation to the governor and after this, while talking to reporters, the things he was pointing out that due to corruption charges against Tejashwi Yadav, the Deputy Chief Minister of the state and younger son of Lalu Yadav
 It was difficult for him to work
 patrakaron se baatcheet main nitish kumaar ne kaha ki wo yah kadam apni antaratma kii aawaaj par uthaa rahe hai
 Four years ago, when Nitish had split from BJP, he had said something similar
 tab unhone kaha tha ki hamane dhokhaa nahin kiya
 We do politics to connect the country
 dhokhaa to unhone kiya he
 In such a situation, it was difficult to work together

 Then the things that Nitish Kumar had mentioned in his letter were seen repeating the same things even today
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki jab pachchis saal pehle hi nitish, lalu se itane dukhi the, aahat the
 Telling him that he was immersed in corruption, why did he go with Lalu after separating from BJP in 2013
 We teach you some parts of this letter
 nitish likhte hai

 Corporate and Minority Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said in the news channel CNN ibn's 'devil's Advocate' program, "of course everyone knows that he (sonia Gandhi) has real power, but he (manmohan Singh) is the real Prime Minister

 Asked whether the Prime Minister's decision to make a cabinet minister with Sonia is not a violation of the Prime Minister's privileges, Khurshid said, "no, it is not a violation
" beshak vah pradhanmantri hai or unhen avashya hi jimmedaari leni chahie, lekin vah (sonia) hamaari party kii netaa hai
 Asked why Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, Urban Development Minister Jaipal Reddy and Sports Minister MS Gill should continue in their posts when several agencies are investigating the alleged scam in the Commonwealth Games
 Khurshid said, "if something concrete and serious appears, then we will take action
" 
 But you cannot punish a person before reaching the final verdict

 khurshid ne yah sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya ki sonia gandhi cabinet ke kisi mantri ke khilaaf karrwai karne se singh ko roak rahi hai
 He said that getting the views of both the leaders before the verdict does not mean that Sonia should be turned away and be told that it is the government, do not interfere in it

 Rajasthan government is going to give reservation to Gurjars once again
 is baar obisi main hi vargeekaran kar gurjaron ko aarakshan diya jayega
 OBC quota will be increased for this
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rajasthan sarkaar kii taraf se mantriyon ke samooh or karnal kirodi singh bansla ke maargdarshan main gurjar pratinidhimandal ke bich samjhauta hua he jiske baad mukhyamantri nivas par is par muhar lagi
 As per the agreement between the Rajasthan government and Gurjar leaders, the OBC quota has been increased from 21% to 26% to provide 5% reservation to five castes including Gurjars
 rajasthan main gurjaron ko paanch fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye alag se jo esbisi (special baikward class) banaakar aarakshan diya gaya tha use notification ke jariye khatm kiya jayega
 For this Gujjar reservation, for the third time in the last 10 years, the Rajasthan government is going to bring a bill in the assembly
 sarkaar ne sanket die hai ki sitambar ke monsoon satr main sarkaar iske liye vidheyak pesh karegi
 In fact, the Chopra Committee, formed after the Gujjar agitation, had said to give five per cent reservation to Gurjars on 15 December 2007, after which the Rajasthan government introduced the Bill in 2008 in the Legislative Assembly giving five per cent and 15 per cent reservation to Gurjars financially

 The Rajasthan High Court stayed the reservation more than 50 percent
 uske baad 6 may 2010 ko 50 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan maanate hue sarkaar ne ek fisadi aarakshan gurjaron ko diya or tab se ye maamla court main hi chal rahaa he
 The Supreme Court has at present placed the order of the High Court in the status quo
 rajya main philhal 28 fisadi aarakshan essi-asti ko he or 22 fisadi obisi ko he jabaki ek fisadi esbisi ko he jisamen gurjar samet paanch jatiyaan he
 But the Gujjars were bent on agitation and were asking for reservation inside the OBC so that it could be saved in the court
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki vidheyak ke jariye esbisi cote koobicemen shaamil kar lene kii sarkaar kii is chaalaaki kaa court par koi asar nahin padegaa or 50 fisadi se zyada keaarakshanpar court ne pehle se roak laga rakhaa he

 We have seen them trying to mainstream terrorism in the past and now what you are telling me is that they want to bring hate speech into the mainstream

 agar jetali hindi main bajet pesh karenge to vah desh ke pehle vitt mantri honge jinhone apana bajet bhaashan hindi main pesh kiya
 Sources reveal that the strategy behind Jaitley's speech in Hindi is that the common people also take interest in the budget, especially those living in rural areas

 Shayarishahdabshire: Munawar Ranavani Publication Price 225 Rs
 urdu ke shaayar munwwar rana ko unke sangrah shahadaaba par sahitya academy puraskaar kii ghoshnaa hui, to soshal cites par fusfusaahaten tej ho gayi
 It is said that by writing ghazals on the mother, she has encouraged passionate poetry or may be a popular poet but does not have an important place in the great poetry of Urdu
 jajbaati shaayari ke aarope par munwwar ne khud hi kaha tha ki unki shaayari old age home ke khilaaf elaan-e-jang he
 By the way, they are aware that the shayari written on the mother has given them strength - who would have explained it to the princess of Tankeed / mother if we had not called her a lion? Born in Rae Bareli, the pen of Munavvar has the fragrance of the soil of Awadh and the conscience for mother, daughters and elders in conscience
 unki samvednaa kaa angan vishaal he
 The Qaumi poet also breathes in them, the idiom that has a great example
 2012 main prakashit shahadaaba unki gajalon, najmon or mukhtsar sheron kaa sangrah he
 Most of them have new ghazals
 najmen pehali baar saamne ai hai
 However the magic that is in his ghazals is not in the nazams
 lekin unki samgr shaayari kaa cheharaa unki gajalon, najmon or prachur maatra main likhe lalit or vaicharik gadhy se banataa he
 Urdu poetry through Nangalib and Mir has reached the stage today, Munawar is its new pen
 unhone yatharth ko kareeb se dekha he, jisaki misaal unki shaayari main har kadam par milti he-ghar kii jaruraton ke liye apni umr ko / bachche ne kaarkaane kii chimney pe rakh diya
 He is not a political poet, but a weak vein in this collection is a ghazal on Sonia Gandhi and a song dedicated to Sahara Shree
 to kya satta kaa vipaksh maani jane vaali shaayari ne ab sikri kii choukhat par apana maathaa rakh diya he? yah baat kuch khatkati he
 The common man has never been out of his senses and this is what makes his poetry special
 ve bolchaal vaali bhashaa se apni shaayari ko sajaate hai, or isliye use kinhin myanon main kamatar nahin aank sakate
 Munawar's poetry moves towards attaining the spirit of humanity where the differences between caste, race and community are erased
 ghazal main unka dastakhat sabase alahada he
 Mune Munawar - My scent in my ghazal is intact / Every lion has a mohar-e munawar on it

 Modi 2
 0 main kai kendriya mantri apana padbhaar grahan kar rahe the or isamen ek naam tha amit shah kaa
 On 1 June, Amit Shah took charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 usee din yah sawaal uthaa ki ab bijepi kaa 'ghar' koun dekhegaa
 The question was also legitimate because bjp's 'chanakya' Amit Shah had now come into the government and was given the responsibility of an important ministry
 sarkaar main unki bhoomika ko dekhte hue jagat prakaash nadda ko bijepi kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Also, in the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Board, it was decided that Amit Shah will continue to be the President of the BJP for the next few months
 loksabhaa chunaav main party ko aitihaasik jeet mili or is jeet ke 5 maheene baad jab maharashtra ,haryana vidhansabha ke jo chunavi nattejey aae hai, uske baad yah sawaal uth khadaa hua he ki kya amit shah ke sarkaar main chale jane se party ko vaise nattejey nahin mil paae
 Amit Shah could not give the party much time due to the important portfolios like Home Ministry, which has had an impact on the election results
 in paanch maheenon main jaise mausam main badlaav aa gaya he or halki thand ne dastak de di he, kya kuch aisa hi asar bijepi main bhi hua he
 Maharashtra and Haryana are number-1, but they are not the result of the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections
 maharashtra kii 288 siton main bijepi ko 105 or haryana kii baat kii jaae to bijepi 40 siton par simat kar rah gai he
 Even in both these states, BJP may be at number one but it could not manage to form government on its own
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi ko pichhali baar ke mukaable bhi is baar kam siten mili hai
 The BJP had won 122 seats in the last assembly elections in Maharashtra
 vahiin is baar bijepi ko keval 105 siten mili hai
 While Haryana had won 47 seats in the last election in Haryana and the BJP formed the government on its own, this time the figure was reduced to 40
 in do rajyon ke jo nattejey aae hai uske baad yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya bijepi ke 'chanakya' kii kam sakriyata kaa asar nateezon par padaa he
 Increasingly active in the government, Home Minister Amit Shah became active from day one as if he were in the party
 ek ke baad ek wo kai faisle le rahe the
 In a short time, the Narendra Modi government at the Center took a historic decision and abolished Article 370 giving privileges to Jammu and Kashmir
 yah ek aisa faisla tha jisko lekar bijepi lambey samay se apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main vaada to karti ai thi lekin puraa nahin kar pai thi
 The activism that Amit Shah showed in and around the house will be remembered for a long time
 anuchhed 370 ko samaapt karnaa hi nahin balki uske baad halaat ko sanbhaalanaa bhi ek badi chunauti thi lekin jis tareeke se puure masale par amit shah ne baarik najar banaae rakhi usee kaa nateeja he ki vahaan halaat puri tarah niyantran main he
 370 Not only in a short time, important decisions were taken by the government on triple talaq and NRC and this was the result of Amit Shah's activism
 padhein: haryana-maharashtra main donon CM nae the, phir bhi dobaaraa jeetne par hamen garv he: PM modiyun hi nahin ban gaye bijepi ke 'chanakya'2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 80 saansadon vaale uttar pradesh kaa prabharee amit shah ko banaaya gaya
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP had won a historic victory in 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, after which people started saying that there is something
 is jeet ke baad july 2014 main amit shah ko bijepi kaa rashtriya adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 In his first term as president, the party achieved historic success in many states
 janvari 2016 main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke rup main dobaaraa se amit shah ko chunaa gaya
 The party won a historic victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and at this time it was Amit Shah
 iske baad unki sarkaar main entry hui or wo party ko ab pehle jaisaa vakt nahin de pate
 It was believed that Amit Shah's chances of paying more attention to the party would be less because of taking over important portfolios like Home Ministry
 ab jo nattejey aae hai uske baad yah sawaal uth rahaa he bijepi ko is bare main bhi sochane kii jarurat padegi
 The biggest challenge before the new president was JP Nadda's challenge as the president was to keep the rhythm of the bjp's victory
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pehali baar maharashtra, haryana main vidhansabha chunaav ho rahe the
 BJP may not have gone to number two in any state, but victory is not a great thing either
 akele apane dam par in donon hi rajyon bijepi sarkaar banane se chook gai he
 It will be a challenge for the new president to maintain the position Amit Shah has made to the BJP during his tenure
 jepi nadda abhi kaaryakari adhyaksh hai, lekin unke saamne party ko sheersh par banaae rakhane ke saath-saath khud ko ek shashakt or damdaar adhyaksh ke rup main pesh karnaa hoga

Did the story happen? Bad days gone or not? Was there a time for loot or not? modi ne kaha, 'chunaav ke baad maine vaada kiya tha ki main pradhanmantri nahin, pradhan santari banuunga
 And will not let any paws fall on the vault
 maine yah vaada nibhaayaa ki nahin, lut kaa khel band karaayaa yaa nahin?' Modi said, 'some people are very upset these days, their problem is that all the people have good days but bad days have come for them
