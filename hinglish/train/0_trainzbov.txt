 shiv kii stuti ke liye rachaa gaya vah samaveda kaa vah strot, jise ravan ne gaaya tha, ko aaj bhi ravan-strot va shiv tandav strot ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 At the end of Shiva worship, Lakshmi remains stable by singing or reciting this Ravanized Shiva Tandava Stotra in Pradosh time
 bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana va upasna ke liye rache gaye sabhi anya stotron main ravan rachit yaa ravan dwaara gaya gaya shivatandav stotra bhagwaan shiv ko atyadhik priy he, aisi hindu dharm kii manyata he or mana jaataa he ki shivatandav stotra dwaara bhagwaan shiv kii stuti karne se vyakti ko kabhi bhi dhan-sampati kii kami nahin hoti, saath hi vyakti ko utkrisht vyaktitv kii prapti hoti he
 That is, a person's face becomes bright and his / her confidence also increases
 shivatandav stotra kaa pratidin paath karne se vyakti ko jis kisi bhi siddhi kii mahatvakanksha hoti he, bhagwaan shiv kii krupa se vah aasaani se purna ho jaati he
 Also it is believed that regular recitation of this hymn also leads to speech attainment
 yani vyakti jo bhi kahata he, vah vaisaa hi ghatit hone lagata he
 Siddhis like dance, painting, writing, yoga, meditation, samadhi etc
 are related to Lord Shiva, so the person who recites the Shivatandava Stotra starts getting success related to these subjects
 itnaa hi nahin, shani ko kaal mana jaataa he jabaki shiv mahakaal hai, at: shani se peedit vyakti ko iske paath se bahut laabh praapt he
 Also, for those people who have snake yoga, kalasarpa yoga or Pitra dosha in their horoscope, reciting Shivtandava Stotra is also very useful for those people, because in Hinduism, Lord Shiva is considered to be the lord of age, death and snake

 Along with this, Chirag Paswan also said that due to the decision given by SC in the case of reservation in promotion, the case of reservation in promotion is stuck
 essi / asti ke maamle main pichhadepan, kshamta or pratinidhitiv ko lekar jo faisla kiya gaya he, use durust karne hetu samvidhan main sanshodhan karnaa chahie
 It is clear that this is an election year, the opposition will try to surround the government in Parliament and outside Parliament with full force, but the NDA allies have to go to the elections, so they join their ideology to influence their party's vote bank
 Issues are being raised so that their vote bank does not slide, even if the Modi government gets in trouble due to the issues raised by them
 dikh rahe hai sahyogi dalon ke tewarajab se tidipi andhrapradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ke mudde par endie se baahar gai tab se endie kai sahyogi dalon ne bijepi par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya

 Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, has clarified that he is not working on the Kashmir problem

 Responding to a question in the Washington-based think tank 'council on Foreign Relations', Holbrooke said that the Kashmir issue is neither included in our mandate nor do countries in the region expect them to do so
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe spasht karne dijie
 i am not working on Kashmir problem
 yahaan tak ki main is samasya kaa ullekh tak nahin karata
 i go to India constantly because we keep telling India about our efforts, because here India is a very important component
 ’’afghanistan or pakistan ke liye america ke vishesh doot richard holebrook ne kaha ki vah agle maah bharat jaaenge

 Holbrooke said, "whenever this question came up, your Indian journalist colleagues mentioned the word 'A' and wanted to know something from me, but i don't because everybody says that i either covertly about it i am working on it or i should work on it
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin unki donon baaten galat hai

 ’’ The Congress released its manifesto on Tuesday for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 congress ne ghoshnaptr main vaada kiya he ki satta main aane ke sashastr bal (visheshadhikaar) adhinium (AFSPA) kii samiksha kii jaaegi
 The BJP has become an attacker on this
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se lekar kendriya mantri arun jetali tak AFSPA ko lekar congress ko kathghare main khadaa kar rahi he
 But, like the Congress, the BJP has promised to review AFSPA
 congress ne apane ghoshnaptr main vaada kiya he ki vah sashastr bal (visheshadhikaar) adhinium (AFSPA) 1958 main suraksha balon ke adhikaron or nagarikon ke maanavadhikaron main santulan banane ke liye sanshodhan karegi or jabaran laapata kiye jane, yon hinsa or yatnaa main mili chhot (immunity) ko hataayegi
 Explain that under the AFSPA Act, the army has got some special rights
 sena kisi ko bhi giraftaar kar sakati he or hinsa kii sthiti main firing bhi kar sakati he
 The Congress has promised an AFSPA review in the election announcement when it comes to power
 bijepi ne is par gambhir sawaal khadey karte hue kaha he ki congress party khatarnaak vaade kar rahi he or uske menifesto main aisa agenda hai jo desh ko todane kaa kaam karte hai
 However, in 2014, BJP also promised a similar review of AFSPA
 pidipi adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir main bijepi ke saath hamaara gathbandhan hua tha or donon partiyon ke bich kaaman minimum program bana tha, usamen AFSPA kii samiksha karne kii baat thi
 Mehbooba Mufti tweeted on Tuesday that the Congress has shown great courage by supporting the issue that the PDP had included in the agenda of its alliance with the BJP
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki AFSPA ko lekar congress jo vaada is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main kar rahi he
 BJP has already done it
 iske baavjood kendriya mantri or bijepi netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ke doston ne jo menifesto banaaya he vah jammu-kashmir or raashtra kii suraksha ko lekar sahi nahin he
 In this manifesto, there are agendas that work to break the country
 yah raashtra kii ekta ke khilaaf jate hai
 The decision taken by the Congress Party and the Nehru Gandhi family regarding Jammu and Kashmir was a historic mistake
 uske liye desh unhen kabhi maaf nahin kar saktaa he
 Preparation is to pursue that agenda in a more dangerous way
 arun jetali hi nahin bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi AFSPA ko lekar congress par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki main congress pramukh se poochna chahta hum
 Does he want to strengthen the armed forces or is he trying to lower his morale? What message does he want to give on AFSPA? Every news of the election will be directly delivered to your inbox

 ) samaajawaadee party main pichley dinon lagaataar vivaadon main rahe shivpal yadav kaa nayaa bayaan akhilesh ke liye musiibat khadi kar saktaa he
 Shivpal Yadav said after nominating from Jaswant Nagar seat that he would form the new party after March 11
 haalanki shivpal ne yah bhi kaha ki philhal ve party ke chunaav nishaan cycle par hi chunaav ladenge lekin aage kaa faisla 11 march ke baad hoga
 Mulayam is also angry, apart from Akhilesh these days, Mulayam Singh Yadav is also angry
 unhone bhi sapa-congress gathbandhan ke paksh main chunaav prachaar karne se manaa kar diya he
 Apart from this, Mulayam Singh had also said that the local SP leaders should contest the seats won by the Congress after the alliance
 dalbadalu ho rahe sapitikat katane ke baad mulaayam-shivpal ke paale ke adhiktar sapa netaa apana dal badal chuke hai
 SP leader Ambika Chaudhary did not take the name of the start
 sharada prasad shukla ne haal hi main apni sarojini nagar seat se areldi pratyaashee ke taur par namakan kiya he
 Sitapur's overbearing leader Rampal Yadav, Beni Prasad's son Rakesh Verma, Kaued leader Mukhtar Ansari and his brother recently Narada Rai, close to Shivpal, have also left the SP
 iske alaava aisi khabaren bhi aati rahi hai ki akhilesh cabinet main mantri raheen or shivpal-mulaayam kii kareebi shaadaab fatima bhi bispi jwine kar sakati hai, haalanki abhi tak unke dalbadalu hone kii pushti nahin hui he
 What will happen? Akhilesh will be the biggest loser due to the displeasure of Asmulayam and the uproar of Shivpal
 sapa-congress gathbandhan kii jeet ke liye puraa jor laga rahe akhilesh ko apni urja apana parivaar sanbhale rakhane main bhi kharch kerani hogi
 On the other hand, the traditional voters of SP, who have been voting till now at the behest of Mulayam and Shivpal, will once again come in a state of confusion
 gauratlab he ki sapa ke adhiktar voter or kaaryakarta netaji se bhaavnaatmak rishta rakhte hai
 His distance from the campaign can be detrimental to both Akhilesh and SP
 sapa sabase zyada majboot upi ke madhya kshetra main hi he
 At the same time, the SP is divided into two camps
 isi kshetra main yadav parivaar kaa grihnagar itawa bhi aata he
 There is anger among SP workers over marginalization of Shivpal Yadav in this area
 in vidhansabha chunaavon main sapa ke navaniyukt rashtriya adhyaksh kii sabase badi chunauti bhitarghaat se ladanaa hi hogi
 a slight vote shift can give a big setback
 The difference of victory in UP elections only determines a few percent vote share
 aise main sapa ke voter kaa asamanjas main hona use bada jhatka de saktaa he
 You can understand this from the figures of the last three assembly elections
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sapa ko kul 29
 13% of the votes were received while the BSP, ranked second, had 25% of the vote
 91% tha
 The SP had a total of 224 seats in its account, while the BSP had to settle for only 80 seats
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bispi ko kul 30
 The vote was 43% while SP stood second with 25
 43% vot mili the
 Significantly, in the elections, SP contested only 393 assembly seats while BSP in 403 seats
 chunaavon main bispi ne 206 or sapa ne 97 siten jiti thim
 SP got a total of 25 in the 2002 assembly elections
 37% vot mili the jabaki duusare number par rahi bispi ko kul 23
 06% votes were received
 aapako bataa den ki in chunaavon main sapa ne 390 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or 143 siton par jeet darj kii thi jabaki bispi ne 401 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or 98 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 In order to stop the Muslim vote, big trouble Ansari has separated from the SP
 bahubali netaa atik ahamed ko akhilesh ne tikat nahin diya
 Removed z Security engaged in protection of MLC Ashu Malik
 ab shaadaab fatima ke bhi party chhodane kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, it is a big problem for the SP to hold the Muslim vote
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki sapa ko congress ke saath gathbandhan kii raah pakadani padi
 The data of the alliance's Fayadaja Opinion Poll shows that the Samajwadi Party's vote share has increased by 7% with the Samajwadi Party's cycle joining the Congress hand
 opinian pole ke mutabik espi ke paas 26 fisadi hai
 But this alliance 33 after being aligned with the Congress
 2% vot milane kaa anumaan he
 However, the bjp's own vote share is unaffected by this new alliance
 asaliyat ye he ki bijepi kaa apana vot share jo disambar main 33% dikh rahaa tha wo janvari main bad kar 34
 8%
 upi main chunaav ab mote taur par bijepi or espi-congress gathbandhan ke bich do ghodon kii daud sareekha ho gaya he
 In December, BJP had a 100-seat lead over nearest rival SP
 lekin ab akhilesh-rahul ke saath ne upi ke raajnneetik samikarnon ko puri tarah badal daalaa he
 Although the Congress is a marginal power in the state, it has helped to increase 76 seats for the so-called secular coalition in a span of one month
 agar upi chunaav kii tulana ghuddaud se kii jaae to disambar main bijepi kaa ghoda kahin aage daud rahaa tha
 But in January its speed started to decline
 duusari ore, espi ke ghode ko congress se shaktivardhak khuraaq mili to isane pehle se kahin tej raftaar se daudna shuru kar diya
 The next few weeks will decide whether the bjp's horse manages to retain its lead or is defeated by the opponent in the last stretch
 philhal, do mukhya pratidwandviyon main vot share kaa antar 1
 Hinges at less than 6%, which itself falls within the 'margin of error'

 cordiyak surgery ko open heart surgery bhi kaha jaataa he
 There are two types of open heart surgery
 ek jab hriday kii nasen block ho jaati hai tab or duusari jab hriday ke volve main samasya aa jaati he
 Let's know how cardiac surgery is done in AIIMS
 jab hriday kii nasen block ho jaati hai to bypass surgery kii jaati he
 Bypass surgery involves an operation of an artery called internal thoracic artery from the inside by making an incision in the chest
 isamen pehle haath yaa pair kii nas lete hai or iskaa istemaal vaahak nalee ke taur par karte hai
 This is done only when there is a problem in all three major arteries of the heart
 isko bypass surgery isliye kehete hai kyonki jahaan par blockege hoti he usase aage bypass nalee ke jariye hriday kii mansapeshiyon main rakt kaa pravaah karaayaa jaataa he
 The woman was rubbed with a stone to make the child blond
 The second surgery is the valve of the heart
 hriday ke andar chaar volve hote hai
 Most of the problem comes in the left side valve
 baanyi taraf ke volvs yaa to sikud jate hai yaa phir li karne lag jate hai
 In both cases, these valves need to be replaced
 ise bhi open heart surgery kaha jaataa he
 'I still write love letters to my girlfriends', apart from this, when a heart operation is done due to a hole in the heart, it is also called open heart surgery

 Whether or not the Samajwadi Party will remain in power after the elections is not decided, but Shivpal Yadav has decided the power of his son Aditya Yadav for the next five years

 That is, whether SP or not will remain in power after the elections, Akhilesh Yadav may or may not be the Chief Minister, but Shivpal's son Aditya Yadav will hold this powerful post in the state

 Sources reveal that fearing this apprehension, Shivpal got Aditya to resign from this post prematurely and two days later by consensus he was re-elected for the next five years
 matlab agar paristhitiyaan bahut hi vikat na huin, to aditya ab 2021 tak is pad par bane rahenge, bhale hi agle kuch hafton main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main samaajawaadee party satta main vaapasi kare athwa na kare
 Congress said - Dirty gameshiwapal's move is being considered as his political masterstroke as he is trying to raise his son against Akhilesh in Samajwadi Party
 shivpal ne is kadam ke jariye ye sunishchit kar liya he ki akhilesh bhale hi agle paanch saal upi ke mukhyamantri na rahen lekin aditya rajya ke is taqatvar pad par kabiz rahenge
 Aditya is also a director on the board of IFFCO and the International Cooperative Alliance
 is bich congress ne shivpal ke is kadam ko darty game bataaya he
 Mohammad Sharif, vice chairman of the city Congress Committee, said that Shivpal has proved that the Yadav family can break all the rules of governance to stay in power

 He said that the Samajwadi Party is taking every step to serve its interests in the government but none of its steps can avoid its defeat in the elections
 unhone kaha ki ye bahut sharmnaak he ki loktantr main yadav parivaar raajaaon kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahaa he or mahatvapurn padon par apane parivaar ke logon kii niyukti kar rahaa he
 He said that in 2017 the Yadav family would lose power and it would prove to be a big relief for the public
 bhala start-ap india kaa mek in india se kya rishta he? vaisaa hi jaisaa ki mek in india kaa bhartiya kheti se he yaa phir gramin arthvyavastha kaa shahari or audyogic arthvyavastha se he, kyonki gramin or kasbaai maang ke bina auto, cement, khaadya or upabhokta utpaadon kaa bazaar aaj jaisi mandi main dub jaataa he
 Start-ups with India's highest valuations (seven times the average of net business) come from e-commerce
 i commers bharat ke vishaal udyog kshetra ke liye choti-si shopping mal jaisaa he
 On the other hand, Start-up India's customers come from urban areas where industries and related services are the biggest source of employment

 Prior to this month, the funding of venture capital-based companies reached $ 12 billion, or about Rs 80,000 crore, in the last two years before the idea of a government start-up fund was generated (the fund is far away)

 The $ 3 billion funding was done in 2015
 isliye start-ap ko paisa kaise milegaa, yah sawaal nahin he balki chunauti to yah he ki inhen bazaar milegaa yaa nahin
 If companies did not start investing in manufacturing services, start-ups would have neither demand nor profit, and then their valuations would become bubbles, fearing that softbank President and COO Nikesh Arora also showed up from the grand platform of Start-up India 
 start-ap india kii safalataa ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi or vitt mantri arun jetali kii jodi ko us mandi ko toduya he jo companiyon kii balance shit main baithi he
 Despite all the serious efforts and serious publicity in the last two years, the challenge of the economy has deepened in the last 18 months
 bharat main udyog, nirmaan or sevaayen rojgaar ke sabase bade strot hai lekin yah morcha til-til kar dhah rahaa he
 Industrial growth hit a four-year low in November
 2015-16 kii pehali do timahi main companiyon kii kamai 6 se 15 fisad ghati
 And this decline has continued for the last two-three years
 lagaataar niryaat mushkilen doguni kar rahaa he
 Despite the efforts of Make in India and two budgets, why the Modi government could not persuade the industries for new investment? India's industry is now under the grip of recession which is called balance sheet rationing in technical parlance
 yah puraani paaramparik mandi se alag or jatil he
 This slowdown arises out of debt owed to companies
 nai arthvyavastha man adhikansh nivesh nijee companiyaan hi karti hai
 During the balance sheet resuscitation, companies are badly in debt, so companies invest whatever they earn in repaying debt and not in new investment
 aisi sthiti main nayaa nivesh khatm ho jaataa he
 Global economists believe that Japan's recession from 1990 to 2005 actually stemmed from the debt that they had taken from banks, squeezing companies' balance sheets
 america main 2007 se 2009 ke bich kii mandi bhi balance shit riseshan hi thi
 The debt has broken the back of companies in India
 ek aarthik akhbaar ke adhyayan ke mutabik, 2014-15 ke ant main desh kii 441 pramukh companiyaan kareeb 28
 5 lakh crore rupees were sitting on loans which 98 of the total 656 non-financial companies of the country
 1 fisadi he
 In December, Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank, did not just tell companies the biggest problem in the way of investment
 companiyon ke sanchaalan laabh karj par byaaj dene yaa chukaane ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 The number of companies feeling such pressure was 16 in 2009-10, which has risen to 29 and now 67 three years ago
 isi tarah companiyon ke nivesh par ritern bhi 2014-15 main ghatakar dashak ke sabase nichle str 7
 Has come to 4 percent
 yahi balance shit riseshan he
 Remember, the debate on reducing the interest rates on loans for growth that took place last year and it seemed that both the Reserve Bank and the Ministry of Finance were on two poles
 alabatta rigerv bank sahi niklaa
 The debt of companies has increased so much that the income they are earning is going to repay the debt
 duusari taraf, bank bakaayaa karjon ke pahaad tale dab gaye hai
 This is the reason why despite the reduction in interest rate neither investment nor growth
 iske saath hi yah samaj main aa gaya ki is mandi kaa ilaaj sasta karj he hi nahin kyonki jis vajah se companiyaan biimaar hai use badhaane vaali dawa vah kyon lengi
 If the Finance Minister agrees with this truth, then the budget will have to be treated for this recession
 sarkaar badalane se sab kuch badal jane ke khyalipulav kii mahak ab khatm ho rahi he or audyogic utpaadan, niryaat, kheti kii upaj, share bazaaron main giravat kii talkh hakeekat saamne aa chuki he to unhen bajet kaa puraa ganit badalanaa hoga
 The last two budgets of the Modi government did not appear to have a major decisive strategy to end the recession
 sirf kharch rokkar or tex badhaakar ghate ko sanbhaalane kii koshish safal hui lekin in bajaton se maang kii kami or us mandi kaa ilaaj nahin hua jo companiyon kii balance shit main paith gai he
 Modern economy ie start-up, old economy ie Make in India and agriculture now want recession cure from all three government, want the dream budget, will the finance minister be able to give big projects, sharp increase in spending and reduction in taxes? If this courage is not shown, then the slope of the real economy should increase to start-up India, then leave it, it will not even give a chance to stay on foot

 tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ke vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram had repeatedly appealed to every section of the BJP to cooperate in getting the insurance bill passed
 lekin unhen har kadam par avrodh kaa hi saamana karnaa padaa
 Now in a changed situation, the beleaguered Congress is sitting on the opposition benches in Parliament and the BJP, which is in power, is similarly opposing the opposition for legislative support to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector
 kursi badalane kaa vichaaron par kitna asar padataa he, uski misaal is bill ko lekar saaf dikhti he
 Whereas a year ago, BJP was advocating provisions to ensure strict control for Indian shareholders, Congress is now opposed to raising capital from foreign institutional investors (fiis) under FDI
 yah virodh ke liye virodh kii raajnneeti kaa umdaa udhaaharan he
 But for the Congress, it is probably more than that
 iskaa sambandh sansad main praasangikta khone kii hataasha se bhi he jahaan sirf rajyasabha main hi uske sankhya bal kii koi ahmiyat rah gai he
 However, being relevant also has different meanings that depend on the motive of power
 yaheen aakar rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne paaya ki unke saamne ek kathin chunauti he
 Where it was clear that the Congress would not let the government sit quietly on the issue of this bill
 congress netaaon kaa kahana he ki is mudde par party kaa virodh sadan kii kaarywahi thap kara dene kii had tak he
 Two kinds of steps emerged here - first, that the government be forced to amend the definition of FDI in the bill and second, to keep the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha stalled as long as possible
 chidambaram, anand sharma jaise kai purv mantriyon or digvijay singh jaise varisht netaaon ke bare main bataaya jaataa he ki ve yah sandesh dene ke liye in vikalpon ko aajamaane ke icchhuk hai ki kisi mahatvapurn mudde par congress bhi sarkaar ko jhukaane kaa madda rakhti he
 The second possibility, which is said to have the support of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and is that no compromise be made until a political price is recovered
 is drushtikon kaa samarthan karne waalon main madhusudan mistre tathaa ambika soni ke naam shaamil hai
 Therefore, when the Trinamool Congress, CPM and AIDMK suggested to set up a Select Committee (select Committee) at the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC), Azad did not delay in taking advantage of the opportunity
 kaha jaataa he ki baad main unhone pramukh vipakshi dalon kii ek gupachup baithak bulaai or bataur netaa vipaksh apane naam se 11 sadasyon vaali ek pravar samiti gathit kiye jane kaa prastaav pesh kiye jane par sabaki sahmati praapt kar lee
 The only party that did not agree was AIADMK because J
 jayalalita ke nirdesh praapt nahin ho paae the
 The initial proposal was submitted without AIADMK and included NCP, which later dropped out
 phir 4 agast ko eiediemke ke ve
 Maitreyan brought Jayalalithaa's consent and introduced an amendment to include her name in the proposal
 ab taaja sthiti yah he ki do baar aage-peeche hone ke baavjood sarkaar tab tak raashtrapati se sanyukt satr bulaane ke liye nahin kah sakati jab tak donon sadanon ke bich asahmati na ho
 In this case, the Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2008 and so far it has not come out
 saaf he ki congress ko bijepi kaa daanv bijepi ke hi saath khilne kaa acha mauka mil gaya he
 The question is, what political price does Congress want to charge in return for support on this bill? If the discussion is going on in the political corridor, then it can be a relief in the National Herald case
 5 agast ko vitt mantri arun jetali ne yah kahkar is atkal ko hawa de di ki agar congress karj chukaa de to maamla khatm ho saktaa he
 It is clear that there is a big intention of the Congress to appear relevant in any way, there is a message for the BJP that if the government does not step up, the Congress can obstruct the path of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic agenda
 congress ne apni baat sunaane kii disha main kadam rakh diya he
 Adopting this path, the Congress has indicated that, whether it has to make any compromise now or in the winter session of Parliament after the Prime Minister's visit to America, it will not let the government underestimate its importance
 congress iske liye upie raaj ke apane rukh se palatney ko bhi taiyaar he
 It is now the responsibility of the government to find a way out of this dispute
 philhal vah narmi ke mood main nahin he
 She can take the risk of rejecting the bill in the Rajya Sabha and start a process that ultimately paves the way for a joint session
 saath hi vah kuch kshetreey dalon ko phir se apane paale main karne kii sambhaavna bhi tatol rahi he
 Whatever, however, something has to be lost
 dilli main bhale hi kadaake kii thand pad rahi he, lekin chunavi maahaul garm he

 'dilli ke dil main' vijay goyal ne kaha ki ham dilli main aisi sarkaar denge jo dharna nahin degi, vikaas karegi
 On the other hand, Ashish Khaitan said that our meetings are crowded

 The Congress did the work of regularizing the colonies

 dilli ke dil main kya he? kaarykram main purna rajya, mahila suraksha, pradooshan, coloniyon ko niyamit kiya janaa jaise mudde janata ne mukhya taur par uthaae he
 In these, BJP appeared to be stuck on many issues and AAP on many
 dilli main siem candidet na utaare ko lekar janata se goyal se tikhe sawaal kiye to kejariwal ke dharna pradarshan par bijepi or congress samet dilli ke logon ne jamkar chutki lee
 Apart from this, Congress leader Mahabal Mishra was also seen giving roundly answers on the issue of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 bihar membijapike netritv vaale endie main chaar dal shaamil hai
 There is a ruckus between all these parties over the seat sharing before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 rajya main kul 40 sansadeey siten hai
 In such a situation, the exact formula of seats between BJP, JDU, LJP and RLSP is going on, but as of now the right path of mutual agreement between these parties does not seem to be found
 bataa den ki pichley saal july 2017 membiharke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne argedy se naata todakar bijepi ke netritv vaale endie main vaapasi kii thi
 Since the arrival of JDUK, there is no coordination between the three other parties of NDA
 angreji akhbaar iconomics times kii report ke mutabik rajya main endie ke sahyogi dalon ke bich seat bantwaare ke chaar formula sujhaaye gaye hai
 Formula number onebjp is working on different formulas for resolution among allies in the NDA
 aise main pehla rasta ye he ki bijepi apni jiti hui 21 siton se do chhod sakati he, lekin araspi ke 1 baagi saansad bijepi ke saath hai
 In this way BJP 20, LJP 6 and RLSP can get 2 seats
 is tarah baaki bachi 12 siten jediu ke khate main aaengi
 However, it is difficult to formulate JDU on this formula, because his party has spoken about the role of elder brother to Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 aise main vah endie main sabase zyada siton kii ummid lagaae hue hai
 Formula number Tubihar BJP does not want to leave the JDU in any case
 aise main bijepi ke saamne doosraa rasta ye he ki vah apni jiti hui 4 siten chode
 In this way, BJP contested 18 seats
 jediu 14, algepi 6 or araspi 2 ko siten mil sakati hai
 JDU may agree on seat sharing in this manner, but RLSP is ready, it is difficult, because in 2014 it had 3 seats in its account
 formula number thriaraspi ke tevar ko dekhakar lagata he ki wo endie se baahar ho sakati he
 BJP 20 if such situations are created
 jediu 14 or algepi 6 siten khate main aa sakati hai
 This formula is something that everyone can agree on, as Nitish Kumar has a good relationship with Ram Vilas Paswan
 RLSP se deal karnaa bijepi ke liye aasaan kaam nahin hoga, jo loksabhaa main zyada siten chaahati hai
 Formula number 4 is the fourth formula for seat-sharing between forda's allies under which BJP and JDU states distribute 20-20 Lok Sabha seats
 iske baad bijepi apane khate se araspi ko siten do or jediu apane khate kii siton main se algepi ko siten de
 In this way both the larger parties agreed with their smaller allies

 pulavama hamale kii jimmedaari lene vaala aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad bhi padosi mulk pakistan kii sarazmi par hi pal rahaa he
 Many terrorist organizations like him who have conspired against India are in the shelter of Pakistan, which has become a terrorist
 un aatanki sanghathanon ke sargana vahaan baithkar har vakt bharat ke khilaaf aag ugalate hai
 Openly threatens India
 aise hi teen aatankwaadi hai, jo aaj bharat ke sabase bade dushman he
 The elimination of these three terrorists is very important
 ham aapako bharat ke in teen dushmano kii kaali karatuuton ke bare main bataate hai
 Enemy No
1 Masood Azhar Bahawalpur is running a terror shop from Pakistan's enemy number one ie Masood Azhar from Pakistan in the name of Madrasas
 bhartiya fouj ke jaanbaaj commando ne bas zaraa sa trailor hi dikhaaya tha ki pakistan main baithe bharat ke dushmano ke paseene chhot gaye
 Masood Azhar is also residing at the new base after the surgical strike
 sutron ke mutabik ab haafiz said or masood donon apane-apane madrason or sanghathan ke headquarter se dur kuch chuninda gurgon ke saath ghani aabaadi ke bich rahane chale gaye hai
 Their thinking behind this is that it is more secure to live among the densely populated
 pathankot hamale ke master mind or aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar par pratibandh lagane kii koshishon par china ke lagaataar lagate vito se sarkaar is masale par nae tareeke talash rahi he
 India certainly has the option of a surgical strike to avenge the Pathankot attack and to rein in terrorist organizations like jaish-e-mohammed
 haal hi main pulavama main siarpief ke kafile hamale kii jimmedaari aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne hi lee he
 Enemy number 2 Hafiz Saeedthiq likewise Hafiz Saeed also runs a panic shop under different names, living in the area of murid, Pakistan
 hafiz said apane thikaane badalata rahata he
 He hides among the people in dense settlements to save his life
 bharat ke sargical strike or international pressure kaa hi asar he ki pakistan ab khulkar haafiz said kaa saath nahin paata
 Pakistan had also put Hafiz Saeed under house arrest to show the world
 paak kaa kahana he ki uski gatividhiyaan desh main shanti ke liye khatra thim
 Along with Hafiz Saeed, the Punjab Home Department also detained four of his associates Abdullah Ubaid, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rahman Abid and Qazi Kashif Hussain
 gauratlab he ki mumbai aatanki hamale kaa mastermind hafiz said kaa sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa pakistan main swatantra he

 But he was winning during the counting but at the same time he was accused of booth capturing and was arrested
 uske giraftaar ho jane ke baad vahaan jamkar hangaamaa hua
 After that there was talk of threats to Salahuddin
 lekin jail se chhootakar aane ke baad usne elaan kiya ki kashmir ko aaazaad karaane ke liye bandook kaa sahaara lenaa hi sahi hoga
 After this Salahuddin subscribed to hizb-ul-mujahideen
 uske baad vah iesai ke sampark main aa gaya
 At the behest of the Pak intelligence agency, he became the head of the organization
 tabhi se vah bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh rachataa rahata he
 The NIA has declared him most wanted
 ghar main ghuskar marampulawama hamale ke baad bharat ke log chaahate hai ki in aatankwaadiyon ko usee tarah se ghar main ghuskar maaraa jaae, jaise osama bin laden ko america navy sil ne uske ghar main ghus kar maaraa tha

 He told the public not to worry, the government electricity companies are neither getting short of poles nor in size of poles
 jabaki purv siem shila dikshit ne bayaan kii ninda karte hue kaha ki aisi bhashaa ek mukhyamantri ko shobhaa nahin detii
 Kejriwal said to the public on the problem of electricity on Saturday, 'don't worry, we are not making any shortfall in punishing the power companies
 na danda main kami he or na danda kii sies main
 However, his statement and the language used in it are also considered controversial
 danda se bijli nahin aati: sheeladusri ore, purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne kaha ki kejariwal bijli companiyon ke liye jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa prayog kar rahe he, aisi bhashaa ek mukhyamantri ko shobhaa nahin detii
 Sheila further said that the power of the poles does not come
 pehle to yahi companiyaan bijli detii thim
 The high-level meeting will be held on the power cut
 Earlier, Kejriwal said on Saturday that the Energy Minister had also held a review meeting on Friday

 He said that power cuts are happening more in the areas of BSES

 He said that the people of Delhi need more electricity due to the scorching heat
 siem arvind kejariwal ke bayaan ke pramukh ansh -- hamane DERC ko policy diarection die hai jo kanoon ke tahat dilli sarkaar ko power he
 - In any area there is undeclared power cut, if there is a storm, it is a different matter, but the unannounced power cut will have to be fixed in two hours
 varna vahaan ke logon ko muaavja dena hoga
 - Have talked to DER C, this policy is going to be implemented soon so that their accountability can be fixed
 - 15 saal pehle dilli main nijeekaran kyon kiya tha
 Because the electricity system in Delhi improved, not every year electricity prices increased
 - hamane sarkaar aane ke baad dilli ke andar bijli ke rate badhane nahin die
 - Accountability needs to be fixed, these people say that the local fault has occurred
 ejineering main tay ho ki folt kya ho rahaa he?- main aajkal raat-raat bhar logon kii shikaayat ke phone uthaa rahaa hum
 - We are showing stick, don't worry
 danda kii kami nahin he, na danda kii sies kii kami he ab

 @ pmoindia — Ram Vilas Paswan (@irvpaswan) 26 September 2019 Apart from this, the Modi government has taken many more decisions to curb interest prices
 sarkaar ne rajyon ko nirdesh diya he ki pratyaksh khudara bikri ke liye centre sarkaar ke paas uplabdh bafer stock kaa upyog karen
 a message has also been sent to the state governments in this regard
 ab tak haryana, andhra pradesh, dilli, tripura or odisha ne is centre sarkaar ke bafer se pyaaj kii maang kii he
 At the same time NAFED has been told not to sell more than Rs 24 per kg onion through Mother Dairy, Safal, NCCF and own shops in Delhi
 sarkaar kii koshishkendre sarkaar ne apane bafer se dilli sarkaar ko pyaaj dene kii peshkash kii he
 Onion kharif crop from Karnataka has already started coming to the market
 isse maharashtra se aapurti ke saath-saath aasapaas ke kshetron main keemton par dabaav kam hoga
 Maharashtra has sufficient stock of onions to meet the current demand
 haalanki, keemton ko kaabo main karne ke liye aapurti par lagaam lagaai ja rahi he
 The government is providing all possible help to fix onion availability
 ab centre sarkaar kii ore se sanyukt sachiv str ke do adhikariyon ko maharashtra bheja ja rahaa he jo kisaanon, vyapaariyon or transportron se baat karke pyaaj kii uplabdhta kii samiksha karenge or adhik se adhik pyaaj bazaar main laane kii koshish karenge

 iske alaava bangladesh or srilanka ko pyaaj ke nunatam niryaat mulya se neeche ke niryaat ko turant roak diya jayega
 On the other hand, trade sources said that onions have started coming into the country from Afghanistan to Pakistan
 sutara ke anusaar afghanistan se jald hi 30-35 trek bharkar pyaaj desh main aa jayega, vahaan uski loding ho chuki he
 The criminal court, which has deep roots in Indian politics, has been hammered by the country's largest court
 supreme court ne ek aitihaasik faisalaa sunaaya he jiske baad daagi netaaon ke liye chunaav ladanaa mushkil ho jayega
 The court has decided that the leaders who will be sentenced to 2 years or more, their membership will be canceled immediately
 haa, agar supreme court kaa faisla inke paksh main aayega to inkaa sadsyta swat: waapas ho jaaegi
 Not only this, a leader will not have the right to vote while incarcerated nor will he be able to contest elections
 kyonki jail jane ke baad unhen namakan karne kaa haq nahin hoga
 This decision of the Supreme Court shall be deemed to have come into force with immediate effect
 supreme court ne janpratinidhiyon ko suraksha kavach pradaan karne vaala janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara 8(4) ko khatm kar diya he
 Under this there was a provision to remain in the post until the appeal is pending after the sentence
 haalanki court ne ye raahat jarur di he ki ye faisla pehle hi doshi tehraae ja chuke un jan pratinidhiyon par lagu nahin hogi jo faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kar chuke hai
 The Supreme Court has heard the verdict on the application of Lily Thomas and an NGO
 janpratinidhiyon ke liye supreme court kaa farmaan bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 The Central Government had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court earlier this year justifying Section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act
 arse se sansad ko svachh banane kii maang hoti rahi he
 According to the May 2009 report of the National Election Watch, there are 150 tainted mps in the fifteenth Lok Sabha
 inamen 73 ke khilaaf gambhir aarope hai
 However, these are not punishment
 lekin itnaa to tay he ki supreme court kaa ye faisla sansad or vidhansabha ko saaf karne kii disha main aitihaasik he
 The Supreme Court gave this ruling during the hearing of the Lily Thomas case
 gauratlab he ki aapraadhik record vaale 'daagi' netaaon ko shashan-tantra se baahar kiye jane kii maang lambey samay se hoti rahi he
 Soon after the important decision of the Supreme Court, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that they welcome it
 unhone kaha ki court ke faisle se vidhayika main sudhaar hoga
 There has been a long-standing demand to bring Lokpal or Jan Lokpal to remove the 'filth' spread in the political system of the country, which is still awaited by the public
 aise samvedansheel or ahm masalon par desh haal hi main andolanon kaa bhi gavaah ban chukaa he
 But after this case came to light, it is clear that Rabri Devi, Nitish Kumar or Sushil Modi all could not uncover this scam
 kam se kam is maamle main shikaayat par jo karrwai honi chahie thi use dabaane kaa kaam unke sarkaar ke samay jarur hua
 However, this time after the case came to light, Nitish Kumar himself disclosed it to the media, and also did not leave the investigation on the district police and sent a special investigation team
 lekin shayad sibiai bhi is baat kaa jawaab jarur dhundhegi ki aakhir 750 karod tak kii raashi ke gaban hone tak aakhir bankers, jila prashasan ke adhikariyon, kuch jila adhikariyon or satta ke kareebi neton kii mileebhagat se ye ghotaalaa badastoor kyon jari rahaa
 However, after the case has gone to the CBI, a big issue has been snatched away from the hands of the opposition parties
 lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki aisi vittiya aniyamitata ko aakhir kyon or kaise saalon tak chalane diya gaya
 One such news has come out from AIIMS in Raipur, when after death a person could not even get an ambulance
 aakhirkaar patni ko apane pati kii laash ko thele par lekar janaa padaa
 The relatives of the person who died behind the cart also moved towards the house and the passerby kept watching the scene
 lekin kisi ne unki madad ke liye apane haath aage nahin badaye
 Meanwhile, the policemen kept an eye on the cart
 unhone thela rukvaaya or phir phone kar ambulance bulawaai
 The help of kind-hearted policemen worked
 chand minute main hi ambulance maukey par pahunchi or mritak kaashav uske gharapahunchaaya gaya
 It is being told that a 35-year-old man named Sanjay was admitted to AIIMS about a month ago
 wo kisi laailaaj beemaari se grasit tha
 The financial condition of the family was so weak that he could not get many tests for his treatment which could not be done in AIIMS
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye test kaaphi mahange hone kii vajah se suvidha ames main nahin he
 Sanjay finally succumbed on Thursday evening
 ames main shav ko ghar tak pahunchane kaa koibandobastanhin tha
 Sanjay's family appealed to several doctors and management of AIIMS to take the body home
 lekin koi bhi unki sahaayta ke liye saamne nahin aayaa
 Sanjay's wife did not have enough money to bear the expenses of the private ambulance
 aakhirkaar usne thela kiraye par liya or usamen apane pati kaa shav rakh apane ghar kii raah pakad lee
 Even the people who were looking at the path did not introduce humanity and did not proceed to help anyone
 pulicekarmiyon kii sahaayta se mritak sanjay kaa shav uske ghar pahunch sakaa

 sutron kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne lokapal kii niyukti ko lekar sellection cameti kii baithak 1 march ko bulaai he
 The Modi government is on target of the Opposition regarding the Punjab National Bank (PNB) Mahaghotale
 vipaksh 5 march se shuru ho rahe sansad ke bajet satr main bhrashtachar ke mudde par sarkaar ko gherne ke liye qamar kas chukaa he

 For this, four days before the commencement of the Parliament session, the government has called a meeting of the Lokpal's selection committee so that an agreement can be made in the name of the Lokpal

 At the same time, the BJP will also equip its mps with information about the steps taken against corruption to respond to the opposition's attack

 On the Congress target, the Modi government has been questioning the Modi government on the pretext of delaying the appointment of Congress Lokpal
 kuch hi din pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne twit kar modi sarkaar par lokapal ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Referring to the Lokpal, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted that 'four years have passed, why are these people who are away from the advocates and responsibilities of democracy silent on the neglect of Lokpal?'

 Scientists say that the presence of a particular bacterium in children's throats may indicate bone and joint infection
 is bacteria ke kaaran bacchon ke chalane-phirane par to bura prabhaav pad hi saktaa he, saath hi saath maut kaa khatra bhi ho saktaa he
 In a new study, researchers found that 'kingella Kingae', a bacteria found in children's throats, is associated with infections in bones and joints
 3 saal ke is bachche ko nahin aata ronaa, tut gaya pair phir bhi ankhon se nahin niklaa aansu, jaaniye kyon
 
 
 Earlier, most infections were believed to be caused by Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria
 tab inkaa ilaaj lambey samay tak antibiotic chalaakar yaa surgery se kiya jaataa tha
 In the last few years, highly sensitive techniques have enabled the precise identification of the bacteria responsible for these infections
 shodhakartaaon ne chah maah se chaar saal tak ke 77 bacchon kaa adhyayan kiya
 He was admitted on suspicion of bone or joint infection
 inamen se 65 bacchon ko pakke taur par haddi yaa jodon kaa sankraman tha
 They found that most of the children under the age of four who had been diagnosed with bone or joint infections were infected with the Kingella Kingae bacteria
 jaaniye, maa ke doodh main aisa kya hota he, jo bacchon ko sankraman se bachaata he
 
 
 Joslene Gravel of Montreal University of Canada said that the most important thing is that we found out that children who had bone or joint infections had these bacteria in their throats
 haalanki sankraman se bache hue bacchon (maatr chah pratishat) main yah baat saamaanya nahin he

 Does the central government have any kind of guideline on the content being served on Amazon Prime, Netflix and other online platforms like this? The Delhi High Court has asked this question to the government
 dilli hai court ne sarkaar se ye sawaal ek yachika par sunwaayee karte hue kiya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki online plateforms par ashleel content dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 In the petition, the court has been requested to issue instructions from the court to create a regulatory body on the online movie app
 yachika main ye bhi kaha gaya he kiamejan prime, netflixor iske jaise anya online platform ke content se desh me logon kii dharmik bhavanaaen bhi aahat ho rahi hai

 lihaaja court ne sarkaar ko apana jawaab dene ke liye kaha he, taaki yah tasviir saaf ho paae ki online plateform par dikhaai ja rahi tamaam chizon par kisi tarah kaa koi sensor he bhi yaa nahi?dilli hai court main is yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta ne kaha ki is maamle main naa sirf iti act kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he balki jis tarah se mahilaon ko nagn avasthaa main alag-alag serial or filmon main dikhaaya ja rahaa he, wo samaaj or parivaar ke liye bahut ghaatak he
 Apart from this, the kind of content being shown on these online platforms is an open violation of Indian Penal Code and IT Act
 yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki jab tak is tarah kii online plateforms ke liye vidhivat guideline nahin banati tab tak in sabhi online plateforms par bain lagaaya jaae
 However, the court has not yet accepted such demand of the petitioner, because firstly the court wants to know the central government's side in this case
 isse pehle bhi dilli hoicourt main netflix kii siries secred games ko bain karne ke liye bhi yachika lagaai ja chuki he
 Serials on the online platform and many series have been accused earlier that by taking advantage of weak guidelines, provocative scenes and controversial dialogues are being shown on the online platform

 Due to heavy rigging and corruption in the supply chain, the government has now decided to give cash subsidy instead of giving cheap food grains to the poor
 garibon ke khaaton main sidhaa paisa transfar kiya jayega
 This evening, there is a meeting of the National Committee on this, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister
 is yojana main garibon ko alag−alag sabsidi kii rakam sidhe cash main di jaaegi
 This money will directly reach their bank account
 sarkaar kaa iraadaa he ki yuaidi card ke aadhaar par garibon kii pahchaan kii jaae or parivaar kii mahilaon ke khate main paise jamaa kiye jaaen
 Every family will get 35 to 40 thousand rupees in a year
 sarkaar ko is yojana par salanaa kul 4 lakh karod kharch karne honge
 The comments sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is paise se log anaaj ke saath-saath rasoi gas, mitti kaa tel or khaad bhi kharid sakate hai, lekin jaankaar kehete hai ki cash sabsidi se garibon ke halaat or bigadenge
 The question is whether in the country with a population of 120 crores, the poor will be identified with the help of Aadhaar
 abhi desh kii kareeb 25 fisadi aabaadi ke paas hi yuaidi hai
 The second big doubt is the fear of ending the PDS i

 kuch jaankaar isse mahangaai badhane kaa andeshaa bhi jataa rahe hai to kuch kah rahe hai ki sarkaar anaaj kharid main dhilaai bartegi, jisase kisaanon kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The question is also why the government is talking of cash subsidy instead of food security bill just before the elections
 sarkaar kaa iraadaa he ki yuaidi card ke aadhaar par garibon kii pahchaan kii jaae or parivaar kii mahilaon ke khate main paise jamaa kiye jaaen
 Every family will get 35 to 40 thousand rupees in a year
 sarkaar ko is yojana par salanaa kul 4 lakh karod kharch karne honge
 The comments sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is paise se log anaaj ke saath-saath rasoi gas, mitti kaa tel or khaad bhi kharid sakate hai, lekin jaankaar kehete hai ki cash sabsidi se garibon ke halaat or bigadenge
 The question is whether in the country with a population of 120 crores, the poor will be identified with the help of Aadhaar
 abhi desh kii kareeb 25 fisadi aabaadi ke paas hi yuaidi hai
 The second big doubt is the fear of ending the PDS i

 the government grain sharing system in the country
 kuch jaankaar isse mahangaai badhane kaa andeshaa bhi jataa rahe hai to kuch kah rahe hai ki sarkaar anaaj kharid main dhilaai bartegi, jisase kisaanon kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The question is also why the government is talking of cash subsidy instead of food security bill just before the elections

 Some experts are also anticipating the rise in inflation from this, while some are saying that the government will slow down the purchase of grains, which can cause loss to farmers

 In response to the remarks made by former foreign minister Natwar Singh in her book, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has said that she will write a book herself, so that everyone will know the truth
 enditivi se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan sonia gandhi ne kaha, "main khud kitaab likhuungi, or tab har vyakti sachai jaanegaa
 
 
 i am serious about writing this (book), and i will write
 
 
 " It is noteworthy that former Foreign Minister Natwar Singh had claimed on Wednesday that Sonia Gandhi had refused to become Prime Minister in 2004, following the bitter objections of her son Rahul Gandhi, not 'hearing the conscience'
 natwar singh ke mutabik rahul gandhi ne aisa isliye kiya tha, kyonki unhen dar tha ki agar sonia pradhanmantri pad sweekaar lengi, to unke pita or daadi kii tarah unki bhi hatya kii ja sakati he
 By the way, 83-year-old Natwar Singh, once considered a friend of the Gandhi family, left the Congress in the backdrop of Iraq's grain-for-oil scandal during the UPA-1 in 2008
 in aaropon ko lekar sonia gandhi ne kaha, "is tarah ke aaropon se ab mujhe koi takalif nahin hoti, kyonki main apni saas kaa goliyon se chalni hua sharir dekh chuki hum, apane pati kaa shav dekh chuki hum
 
 
 i have risen above being unhappy with such things
 
 
 " Talking about Natwar Singh, the Congress President said, "they keep doing what they want to say, i don't mind
 
 
 unhen agar in kaamon se khushi milti he, to ve karte rah sakate hai
 
 
 But i do not have any problem with them, because i am used to all this
 
 
 " On the remarks of former Congress leader Natwar Singh, Manmohan Singh said, i did not show any file to Sonia Gandhi, private conversation should not be public
 ullekhneey he ki purv videshmantri natwar singh apni kitaab main likhaa he ki rahul kisi bhi keemat par nahin chaahate the ki sonia gandhi pradhanmantri bane
 Rahul feared that his mother would be murdered like grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv Gandhi
 natwar singh ne yah bhi daawa kiya he ki beeti 7 may ko priyanka unase mahila mufti kii poshaak main milin or is baat kii guzarish kii ki vah 2004 ke sonia prakaran kaa zikr kitaab main na karen
 Natwar Singh also claims that Sonia apologized for her behavior
 kitaab main likhaa gaya he ki sonia kii pahunch sarkaar kii tamaam ahm filon tak thi or saare jaruri faisle 10 janpath par liye jate the
 According to Natwar Singh, Sonia Gandhi's control over the party was more than that of Indira Gandhi
 unki har baat party ke liye kanoon thi
 Natwar, a minister in the Rajiv government, claims that Sonia Gandhi is a better leader than Rajiv
 is par purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha, maine sonia gandhi ko koi file nahin dikhaai, nijee baatcheet saarvajanik nahin honi chahie 83-year-old Natwar Singh, who was the foreign minister in the UPA government, had to resign in 2005 after being named in the oil-for-food grain scam
 iske baad 2008 main unhone congress chhod di 
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that this is his statement
 party se baahar jaakar 9-10 saal baad unhone ye kaha
 There is talk on both sides
 kitaab aae log padhein, uske prachaar ke liye bhi aisa ho saktaa he
 NCP leader DP Tripathi said that Natwar Singh is an educated politician
 nehru ji ke samay se sambandh hai, indira ji, rajeev ji or sonia ji ke samay main bhi rahe
 They may not have written it wrong
 bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki congress kaa cheharaa benakaab ho gaya he
 What we and Modi ji said was the power in the hands of mother and son, it proved the same
 sipiai netaa atul anjaan ne kaha ki jab wo videsh sachiv the, budhimaan the, congress main aane par (dimag) girvee rakh diya
 Earlier it was said that the leader is right, my future is bright
 aaj kehete hai ki leader is rong, maai future ij note good BSP leader Mayawati said that she (natwar Singh) is responding to whatever the Congress president said about her by referring to his book

 aapako bataa den ki 2016 main jab siesi ne anil kumble ko coach chunaa tha, tab bhi sachin tendulkar ke alaava saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana siesi ke sadsy the, tab team ke diarector rah chuke shastri kaa coach bananaa tay mana ja rahaa tha, lekin anil kumble kii entry ne saare sameekaran badal die
 Tendulkar had also favored Shastri and said that the team was also happy with him and that he should be appointed the coach of the team, but Sourav Ganguly preferred Anil Kumble at that time

 (aap log apana bachapan yaad karenge to samaj jaaenge ki main ise 'mushkil' jagah par 'funsana' kyon kah rahaa hum
 
 
 Actually, for a child who is not even a year old and does not know how to walk, even getting down from the bed without help from anyone can be a difficult task like climbing a mountain
 
 
 ) As the video begins, the child is seen sitting on the bed with a nipple in his mouth, and it is clear that there is no one in the room other than the child and the camera who can help him
 
 
 khayr, camera laga hone kii vajah se hi ham or aap vah kartab dekh paae, jo is hoshiyaar bachche ne kuch hi second baad kiya, or apane pita kii chaati garv se phula di

 com / lkolxstip4— simon hughes (@theanalyst)july 31, 2019naish ne 1966 se lekar 1983 ke dauraan 17 saal ke apane pratham shrenee cricket kariyar main 993 wicket hasil kiye the
 We got independence from British slavery on 15 August 1947
 isi din vishwa ke nakshe par bharat ko alag pahchaan mili
 Also, we got the freedom to sing the national anthem 'jana-gana-mana'
 saal 2016 main cinemahol main bhi raashtragan bajaanaa anivaary kar diya gaya
 Let us know in which eight places it is necessary to play the national anthem and what are the other rules of singing the national anthem
 supreme court ne bataaye ye niyam- cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle raashtragan bajaayaa jayega
 - It is mandatory to show the national flag on the screen while playing the national anthem
 - raashtragan bajte samay haul ke daravaaje band kar die jaaen
 - During the national anthem, people present in the hall should stand in its honor
 - raashtragan ko sankshipt karke yaa kaat-chhaant kar bajaane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 - The national anthem cannot be used for economic gain
 - kisi bhi haal main raashtragan ke natya roopaantar kii ijaajat nahin hogiye hai wo aath maukey jab bajataa he raashtragansarkaar dwaara yojit yaa aupchaarik rajya kaaryakramon or anya kaaryakramon main raashtrapati ke aagaman par
 The National Anthem is played on special occasions such as the arrival of the Governor or the Governor / Lieutenant Governor inside the respective States / Union Territories
 rajyapal / leftinent governor ke unke rajya / sangh rajya ke andar aupchaarik rajya kaaryakramon main aagaman par
 It is played before the film starts in the cinema hall
 ol india radio par raashtrapati ke raashtra ko sambodhan se purv or uske baad raashtragan gaaya jaataa he
 The national anthem is sung when the national flag is inaugurated in the parade
 jab regiment ke rang prastut kiye jate hai to raashtragan gaaya jaataa he
 The national anthem is sung to hoist the colors of the Indian Navy
 pehle ye tha niyamsaal 1960 ke dauraan bhi cinema haul main film khatm hone ke baad raashtragan bajaane kaa niyam tha
 But as the film rang later, people used to leave before it, so it was discontinued
 bacchon ko nikaale jane par supreme court ne kaha1985 main ek anokhaa maamla aayaa jab tamilnadu main ek vishesh sampradaay ke teen bacchon ne skool main raashtragan gane se manaa kar diya
 When the management expelled him from school, the children resorted to court
 supreme court ne is maamle main faisla diya ki raashtragan ke samay khadey hone or ise gane kii koi baadhyataa nahin he
 Human commitment is also responsible in this
 teen saal kii ho sakati he sajaalekin niyam ye bhi he ki yadi koi rajkeey kaarykram main raashtragan ke dauraan khadaa nahin hota yaa phir ise gane se manaa karata he to ye dandaneey nahin he
 If someone intentionally interrupts while singing the national anthem at national events on Independence Day, he may have to face a three-year sentence and a fine

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal in dinon dilli ke alag alag vidhansabhaon main jaakar vot maang rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party is also putting all its efforts to win its MP candidate in seven seats, but in the meantime, AAP MLA Arvind Kejriwal's desire to become Prime Minister is seen in public
 darasal, badali vidhansabha se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak ajesh yadav ek sarkari kaarykram ke dauraan dilli sarkaar kii ore se karaae gaye kaamkaaj kii tarif kar rahe the
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was accompanied by Minister Satyendar Jain on the stage here
 tabhi apane bhaashan main 'aap' vidhayak ajesh yadav ne arvind kejariwal kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha, "aap jaisaa mukhyamantri jis pradesh ko mil jaae us pradesh kii kismat acchhee or mujh jaise vidhayak ko arvind kejariwal mil jaae to meri netagiri main kismat acchhee
 i pray that if you (arvind Kejriwal) become the Prime Minister of this country, then the luck of this country is also good
 "iske baad bhaashan dene aae mantri satyendra jain bhi sarkari manch se aam aadmi party ke saansad ko jitaane kii apil karte najar aae
 Satyendra Jain asked the people at the event that "how many mps will be won this time out of 67 seats in Delhi? If the MLA is from Kejriwal, the government is for Kejriwal, then the MP should also belong to Kejriwal
" "mantri satyendra jain ke bhaashan ke dauraan dilachasp mode tab aayaa jab logon se puch baithe ki is baar pradhanmantri koun banegaa? tabhi janata main maujuud aam aadmi party samarthak ne tej aawaaj main jawaab diya 'arvind kejariwal sahab'
 Satyendra Jain targeted PM Modi and said that "this time Narendra Modi will not become the Prime Minister of the country, then do not get caught up in him because PM Modi himself has been circling abroad and has made the country big
 "sarkari manch se tarif hi sahi lekin aam aadmi party ke vidhayak or samarthak ab arvind kejariwal ko pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhne kii baat khuleam kar rahe hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mangalvaar ko karnataka ke udupi main ek jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 In his speech, PM Modi took two shots with one stone in front of the people of Karnataka
 chunavi raily main unhone ech di devgauda kaa zikr karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par purv pradhanmantri ke apmaan kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Prime Minister said that whenever former Prime Minister Deve Gowda asked for time in Delhi, i met him
 devgauda jab ghar aate hai to main unki gaadi kaa darwaja kholkar unka swaagat karata hum
 When they leave, i make them sit in the car
 vehamaare raajnneetik virdodhihai, lekin ve hamaare sammaneey netaaon main se ek hai
 Taking a dig at the Congress President, the PM said that how the Congress President was mentioning Deve Gowda in election meetings, this is your ego
 abhi to aapke kariyar kii shuruyaat hui he
 You humiliate them
 abhi aapaki jindagi kii shuruyaat he, unke aane vaale din kitne bure ho sakate hai, aap soch sakate hai
 In fact, during an election rally in Karnataka, the Congress President had called Deve Gowda's Janata Dal Secular (JDS) as bjp's b team
 is par palatwaar karte hue devgauda ne bhi kaha tha ki yah vakt tay karegaa, koun kiski bi team he
 Let us tell you that in 2004, BJP and JDS formed a government in Karnataka
 modi ke bayaan ke mynepiem modi jaanate hai ki agar chunavi nateezon main bijepi bahumat kaa aankada nahin chhu paati he to devgauda kii party jedies kingmekar ban sakati he
 According to all opinion polls, no party is getting majority in Karnataka
 india today ke pole main congress ko 90 se 101 seat or bijepi ko 78 se 86 seat milane kii sambhaavna he
 On the other hand, JDS is likely to get 34-43 seats
 aise main agar trishanku vidhansabha rahati he to bijepi ko bahumat ke liegedies kaa saharalena pad saktaa he
 This is the reason why during the election rallies, PM Modi is constantly attacking the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi but other important opposition parties are adopting a soft attitude towards the JDS and their leaders
 kya rahegaa jedies kaa rukhopanian pole ke baad jedies ke mukhya pravaktaa danish ali kah chuke hai ki jedies karnataka main congress or bijepi donon ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahi he
 He said that the JDS has been talking of non-bjp and non-congress camps at the national level and is preparing a front outside the two national parties across the country
 unka kahana he ki pole main sthaneey party ko hameshaa kamatar aanka jaataa rahaa he lekin nattejey main jedies purna bahumat ke saath sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The results of the last election, in the 2013 assembly elections, Congress won 122 of the 224 seats in the state, while BJP and JDS won 40 seats each
 bijepi se baghawat kar chunaav ladane vaale bies yediurppa kii kegepi mahaj 6 siten jeet saki thi
 Apart from this, others had got 16 seats
 haalanki baad main yediurppa dobaaraa se bijepi ke saath aa gaye
 Let me tell you that voting for 224 seats for the 225-member Karnataka Assembly will be held in a single phase on May 12
 15 may ko voton kii ginati kii jaaegi
 If you are part of any work in which income tax is paid, then Aadhaar number is mandatory for you
 agar aapaki mali haalat durust nahin he yaa saamaajik pichhadon main shumaar hai or sarkari kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh lene kii darkaar he to aapako 12 ankon kii vishisht pahchaan sankhya dikhaani hi hogi
 And if you do not come in any of these but want to do financial transactions, then you need a permanent account number or PAN number
 lekin aapako apni pan sankhya ko aadhaar se jodpha hi padegaa
 In short, if you want to live peacefully, if you want to take advantage of the facilities of being a citizen of India, then you have to keep your Aadhaar number ready
 supreme court ke 26 sitambar ko aadhaar (vittiya or duusari sabsidiyon kaa lakshith vitaran, laabh or seva) adhinium, 2016 kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata pradaan karne vaale faisle kaa vyaavhaarik matlab yahi he
 However, upholding its validity, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court quashed Section 57 of the Act, which allowed companies or even individuals to ask for an Aadhaar number to provide goods or services
 sarvocch adaalat ne march 2017 main tri ke us circular ko bhi khaarij kar diya jo mobile number ko aadhaar se jodgaye ko anivaary banaata tha
 Now the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the agency implementing the Aadhaar scheme, has asked telecom companies to submit a plan to abolish the Aadhaar-based certification system by October 15, as per the Supreme Court order
 lekin mobile phone or bank khaaton se aadhaar sankhya ko jodgaye kii yojanaayen to abhi badastoor kaayam hai
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is advocating for a bill to be passed in Parliament
 madras hycourt main aadhaar ko matadaata sankhya or voter aaidi card se jodgaye ke liye ek janhit yachika bhi daayar ho chuki he
 The Election Commission has also said that it has no objection in this
 beshak, aap bina aadhaar card ke bhi matdaan karne jaise kai adhikaron ke hakdaar hai
 You can refuse to mention the Aadhaar number to banks (also government), phone companies and school-colleges, etc
 lekin aadhaar or pan card ko jodgaye or pan card banavaane ke liye aadhaar ko anivaary banaakar supreme court ne paroksh rup se to yah aashwast kar hi diya he ki aapke bank khate ke byore yuidi tak pahunch jaaen
 PAN number is now mandatory to open a bank account in the country
 sarkari kalyankari yojanaon se aadhaar ko jodgaye kii ijaajat dene ke liye adaalat ne is daleel ko manjuur kar liya ki isse vyapak janhit saadhaa ja rahaa he
 While delivering the verdict, Judge Arjan Kumar Sikri said that the bench is satisfied with the plea that Aadhaar is a reasonable target, an appropriate measure for prevention of leakage and misuse
 adaalat ne aadhaar kanoon kii dhara 7 ko kaayam rakhaa, jiske mutabik desh ke samekit kosh se puri kii jane vaali sarkari yojanaon ke liye yah anivaary he
 This means that if you want to avail the benefits of ration, LPG subsidy, MNREGA etc
 then you will have to provide your Aadhaar number or Aadhaar application number
 aadhaar ke pairokaar aksar yah daleel dete hai ki isse sarkari yojanaon ke vitaran main khamiyaan dur hui hai
 Welcoming the Supreme Court verdict, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, "about 500,000 welfare schemes, worth about Rs 90,000 crore every year, are plugged by the use of Aadhaar numbers for identification
 kii bachat hui he
 Even Rahul Matthan, an author on privacy matters, agrees that Aadhaar's digital infrastructure is helpful in driving economy
 ve kehete hai, "lone paane ke liye kevaisi (apane graahak ko jaane) prakriya kaa kharch 1,000 ru
 While Aadhaar-based e-kyc costs only Rs 5
 hi baithta he
 However, a study by NITI Aayog in Puducherry, Chandigarh and dadar-nagar Haveli between January 2016 and March 2017 showed that the leakage in direct benefit transfer through Aadhaar-linked bank account was comparable to the earlier public distribution system leakage Have not been reduced
 data gopneeyata kii prabal pairokaar arthshaastri reetika kheda ke mutabik licage ko khatm karne yaa vaazib labhaarthi kii pahchaan main aadhaar koi bhoomika nahin nibhaa paata he, iske badale isse logon ko daayre se baahar karne kaa ek tarika taiyaar ho gaya he
 In fact, Kheda claims that the primary goal of the Aadhaar scheme has never been to involve more people and improve the process of welfare schemes
 unhone ek stambh main likhaa, "ekadam spasht vyavsaayik pariyojna ko aage badhaane ke liye kalyankari yojanaon kii chaashni main lapeta ja rahaa he
 These business activities require a base like digital infrastructure, which has been prepared with public money
 '' apane daawey ko pusht karne ke liye ve kahati hai ki aadhaar infrastracchar taiyaar karne main madad karne vaale kai "swayamsevak'' ab uskaa istemaal karke apana vyavsaay khadaa kar rahe hai
 The Supreme Court noted an article in which he referred to a survey of 900 families in Jharkhand
 surveykshan se sabit hua ki anivaary aadhaar pahchaan prakriya se bujurg vidhwaaon jaise sabase durbal log dukaan par apni pahchaan puri karne ke liye nahin ja sake or usase dusron ko baari kathinaayee uthaani padi
 a bench headed by then Chief Justice Deepak Mishra agreed that Aadhaar was designed to benefit only the deprived sections but also gave a clear warning to the government, "in the context of serious complaints of exclusion from the scope of financial gain, the court It is directed that not a single person should be deprived of welfare schemes such as grain distribution on the pretext of Aadhaar number
 ''lekin aadhaar kanoon kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti dene vaale yachikakartaon kii badi chintaa aadhaar kaa vah tantra he jo sarkaar ko samaaj par vyapak najar rakhane kii suvidha muhaiyaa kara detaa he
 The petitioners contended that the Aadhaar law violated the basic right to privacy, which the Supreme Court had validated in 2017
 aadhaar pariyojna ke tantra main ek kendriya pahchaan data kosh (siidiaar) he, jo data rakhata he or uske pramanikaran kaa hisaab-kitaab karata he
 One petitioner argued that through this mechanism, government officials can find out the location of a person seeking certification
 ek yachikakarta arthshaastri jyaan drej kehete hai ki adaalat ke faisle ne aadhaar se sarkaar ko vibhinn databes se judye or taak-jhaank kaa infrastracchar khadaa karne kii takat par na ke baraabar hi ankush lagaaya
 Senior advocate Shyam Dewan argued in the Supreme Court that the Aadhaar project is an electronic means of controlling people
 kheda kahati hai, "kendrikrut or ek-duusare se jude databes trekking, profiling ko aasaan banaata he jisase swatah-sensorship kii pravriti bhi bad sakati he jisase hamaari aazaadee khatre main pad jaati he
 "indeed, if Aadhaar is eventually linked to bank accounts, mobile numbers and voter cards, the government will be able to monitor its citizens day and night
" sarkaar kii "aadhaar anivaary hona chahieya kii hunkaar se iske aalochakon ne yahi ashanka to jaahir kii thi
 Mattan also agrees that the possibility of linking different databases can endanger people's privacy
 ve kehete hai, "aadhaar kaa data apane aap main khatarnaak nahin he
 The danger is that Aadhaar should be linked to government databases like MNREGA, LPG distribution
 philhal to ye alag-alag mantralayon ke jimme hai or unhen jod paanaa aasaan nahin he
 But if there is any initiative to add them, then according to the interpretation of the Supreme Court last year, the right to privacy must be kept in mind
 ''in chintaaon par court ne tavajjo to di par kaha ki aadhaar main nunatam data hi hota he or iskaa istemaal vyapak janhit main hota he
 However, the court also provided partial relief
 vah praavdhaan radd kar diya gaya jisase paanch saal tak pramanikaran ke record rakhane kii ijaajat milti thi yani jab-jab koi apni pahchaan bataane ke liye aadhaar kaa istemaal karata, paanch saal tak uskaa record rakhaa jaataa
 Such a record can now be kept for only six months
 adaalat ne logon ke lenden kaa meta data rakhane par bhi pratibandh laga diya
 This means that UIDAI cannot collect data sets and cannot use them for further data analysis
 supreme court ne aadhaar kanoon kii dhara 33 (2) ko bhi radd kar diya, jisase rashtriya suraksha ke naam par suraksha agenciyon ko data muhaiyaa karaane kii ijaajat milti thi
 Section 47 of the law was also dismissed, according to which only the government had the right to complain of theft of Aadhaar data
 ab koi vyakti bhi isaki shikaayat kar saktaa he
 The Supreme Court also asked the government to enact strict laws for data security as soon as possible
 philhal to sarkaar vyaktigat data suraksha vidheyak, 2018 ke masaude kii jaanch-parakh kar rahi he, jise nyaayamurti bi
 N
 shrikrishna kii aguai vaali visheshgy samiti ne july main saunpa tha
 The most vehement criticism of the draft of this bill is that it has provisions for strict action against private players for breach of data privacy, but in the case of government it becomes soft
 neshnal institute of public finans and policy kii kansaltent smriti pashira ke mutabik, khufia or kanoon kii rakhwali duusari agenciyon ko data uplabdhta ke maamle main prastaavit vidheyak main kade praavdhaan kiye jane kii darkaar he
 She says, "there is a big difference between what is said in the report and the form it is included in the proposed bill
 masalan, khufia or pulisia agenciyon ko data uplabdh karaane ke maamle main report main saaf kaha gaya he ki maujuuda vyavastha naakaafi he or taakazank karne kii ijaajat ke liye purv nyaayik samiksha kii vyavastha jaise sudhaaron kii darkaar he
 But this idea has not come in the draft of the Bill
 ''nyaayamurti shrikrishna bhi sarkari taakazank ke khatre se waakif hai
 He has recommended that the executive should enact laws related to judicial supervision on peeping action
 matthan kehete hai, "aisi taak-jhaank ke liye har chah maheene par sansadeey manjuuri lene kaa bhi prastaav he, taaki loktantr ke teenon stambh sahabhaagi ban saken
 Then, he points to the biggest drawback of the proposed secrecy law, that there is no penal provision on the government for violating confidentiality provisions
 shaayad isi khami kii vajah se sarkaar aadhaar ke maamle main bhi supreme court ke aadesh kii avhelnaa kaa saahas juta leti he
 For example, despite the Supreme Court's directive to limit Aadhaar to just five welfare schemes in 2015, the Narendra Modi government linked Aadhaar with at least three dozen welfare schemes
 ab sarvocch adaalat ne sarkaar ko chetaya he ki jinke paas aadhaar nahin he, unhen kalyankari yojanaon se vanchit na kiya jaae kyonki unke liye abhi bhi koi tantra or dishanirdesh nahin he
 How the Supreme Court reshuffled the Aadhaar law - Section 57 of the law was repealed, which also allowed companies or individuals to ask for an Aadhaar card in goods or services transactions - Section 33 (1) Identification and authentication records The information was allowed to be disclosed, unless the order of the court below the District Judge
 is upadhara ke bare main ab supreme court ne kaha he ki us vyakti ko sunwaayee kaa mauka diya janaa chahie-kanoon kii dhara 33 (2) ko khaarij kar diya gaya jo centre sarkaar ke sanyukt sachiv str ke adhikari ke nirdesh par rashtriya suraksha ke hit main pahchaan or pramann record jaahir karne kii ijaajat detii thi
 The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial officer (preferable if there is an existing judge of the High Court) should be involved in this case and that the government should bring a new law in this regard- Section 47 was repealed which would make the right to complain in case of data theft Used to give authority not only to the person but to the UIDAI
 ab agar kisi ko lagata he ki uskaa data chori hua to vah shikaayat kar saktaa he-pahchaan pramanikaran record paanch saal tak surakshit rakhane kaa praavdhaan khaarij ho gaya
 Now it can be kept for only six months - the provision of securing meta data of transactions of individuals is rejected
 matlab yah ki yuidi data set nahin bana saktaa or na adhik data yaa vishleshan ke liye use surakshit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa-yuidi companiyon ke saath data saajha nahin kar sakegaa*** Kenya's security forces have taken Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall under their 'control'

 The security forces' operations against the attackers will be announced soon
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki imaarat kii talaashi le rahe suraksha balon ko kahin bhi pratirodh kaa saamana nahin karnaa pad rahaa he
 He said, 'our special forces are searching the rooms inside the building
 hamaara maananaa he ki prayek bandhak ko baahar nikaal liya gaya he lekin ham koi bhi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahate

 Jadhav said that due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms in March, fruits of mango trees of other species fell in large numbers in the Kattiwada region, but the fruits of Nur Jahan, due to its high weight and strong grip with dal, caused this havoc of nature

 nafrat kii buniyaad par khinchi gai hindustan or pakistan kii sarhad kii lakeer ke donon taraf maahaul garm he
 Although there are five types of border lines between India and Pakistan, but most of the movement is on the LOC i
e
 Line of Control
 vahi elosi jise paar kar bharat ne pakistan ko pakistan main ghus kar maaraa or usee ke baad se pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he or lagaataar elosi par gadabadi karne kii firaaq main he
 Our soldiers on the outskirts are so ready that not a single PAK is going on
 pakistanke uri hamale kaa badla hindustan ne elosi ke teen kilometre andar ghus kar sargical strike se liya
 Pakistan has been troubled since this attack
 wo pachaa nahin paa rahaa he ki hindustan is tarah ghar main ghus kar bhi use maar saktaa he
 So now he is engaged in such a change that how can he remove his shame in any way
 iske liye wo lagaataar chatapata rahaa he or usee chatapataahat main elosi par lagaataar golibari bhi kar rahaa he
 But Pakistan does not know that the lions of the border are awake

 ab chunki elosi ko donon hi desh vivaadit maanate hai, lihaaja elosi par hi sabase zyada halchal rahati he
 It is said that there is no more patrolling on any border in the world than South Korea and loc
 uri hamale ke jawaab main elosi par sargical strike bharat kii ek sochi -samajhi ranneeti kaa bhi hissaa tha
 Since both countries are considered disputed by LOC
 aise main elosi ke andar aisa koi oparation karnaa kisi desh kii seemaa main ghuspaith yaa us desh par hamalaa nahin mana ja saktaa, naa hi ise jang kaha ja saktaa he
 The PAK army is aware of the surgical strike
 However, if India did this surgical strike through any part of the indo-pak border, then it was considered a violation of the border or a threat of war, and this is also being said by the experts of Pakistan itself
 sargical strike ke baad baqayada bhartiya fouj nepakistani phojko is oparation kii jaankaree bhi di thi
 The reason was that where this operation took place, it was LOC i

 The round-the-clock vigil is no less than a big challenge amidst the difficult situation in this desert area bordering the india-pakistan border
 vaise to ye border aatankwaadiyon or taskaron kii ghuspaith ke lihaaj se pehle se hi samvedansheel he, lekin ab nae halaat main isaki samvedansheeltaa kahin zyada bad gai he
