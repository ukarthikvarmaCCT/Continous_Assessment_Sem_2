 While a clean chit was given to Narendra Modi by a Gujarat court in the 2002 riot case, the BJP praised it as a moral victory, while the Congress said that the option of legal avenue was still open, while the Left parties called it unfortunate
 adaalat ke aadesh kaa swaagat karte hue bhaajapa ne congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki party modi ko aapraadhik maamle main fansaana chaahati he, kyonki vah raajnneetik taur par nahin lard sakati
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that fake statements cannot be evidence
 asaty or satya ke bich ek buniyadi fark yah hota he ki satya ke saath sabhi tathy ekasaath rahete hai, jabaki asaty bikhar jaataa he
 He said that giving a clean chit to Narendra Modi in connection with the 2002 Gujarat riots confirmed the bjp's view that the allegations were propagated and politically and there were no facts
 unhone kaha, hamen yah kehane main koi sankoch nahin he ki congress party narendra modi ke khilaaf koi raajnneetik ladaai nahin lard sakati he, isliye is tarah ke dushprachaar karti rahi he
 Jaitley said, Modi remained unaffected by the propaganda of the Congress party and its friend ngos in the last 11 years and during this time he had a landslide victory in the state elections of 2002, 2007 and 2012
 unhone kaha ki raajnneetik or prashasnic kushalta sabit karne ke baad modi ko aaj nyaaypalik ne bhi paak-saaf qaraar dene kii pushti kii he
 This is a moral victory for BJP and Narendra Modi
 ullekhneey he ki modi ko badi raahat dete hue metropolitan adaalat ne 2002 ke dangon ke maamle main vishesh jaanch team dwaara unhen clin chit die jane ke khilaaf daayar jakia jaafaree kii yachika khaarij kar di
 Jaitley said that the allegations of some people have been proved wrong by this decision, which said that Modi had a role in the Gujarat riots
 adaalat ke faisle par kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha he ki ve peediton ke dard ko samaj sakate hai
 On Sibal's statement, Jaitley said, "we all understand the pain of the victims of all the riots, including the victims of the 1984 riots
" unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad yah pehali ghatana he jab ek mukhyamantri ne aarope lagane ke baad apane khilaaf jaanch ayog gathit kiya
 After this the Gujarat Police investigated, then the Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigated and its Supreme Court, Nyaya Mitra
 jetali ne kaha, itani jaanch ke baad modi nirdosh hokar baahar nikle hai
 Congressmen can compare this with the 1984 anti-sikh riots
 udhar, congress ne kaha ki yah nahin mana janaa chahie ki adalati faisla 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke silsile main mukhyamantri narendra modi ko mili clin chit kii 'pushti' he or is maamle main shikayatakarta ke liye sabhi kanoonee vikalp ab bhi khule hue hai
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters that the complainants are entitled to challenge this order
 bhaajapa ke liye is faisle ko nyaayik tathyon par aakhri shabd maananaa yaa pushti bataanaa galat tathaa puri tarah se digbhramit karne vaala he
 Singhvi said that by the time an upper court is looking into the complainant's complaint, Modi has received temporary relief and the Metropolitan Magistrate has rejected the protest petition
 unhone kaha ki jahaan tak jakia jaafaree maamle kaa sawaal he, congress is rukh par kaayam he ki vaastavik ghatana kaaphi bheeshan or ghrunit thi
 Singhvi said that as far as Modi is concerned, it is the decision of the Metropolitan Magistrate who has dismissed the petitioner's petition
 congress ko is charan main kuch nahin kahana he, kyonki shikayatakarta ke liye sabhi vikalp khule hai

 adhiktar aatankwaadiyon ko sena ne afghanistan main soviet sena ke khilaaf or kashmir main bharat ke khilaaf yuddh ke liye poshit kiya tha
 It was claimed that when the loss of life or property or the allies objected to the repression action in their constituencies, the leaders usually do not have the courage to face public opinion

 jama masjid ke mukhya imam saiyad ahamed bukhari ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki unhone congress ke khilaaf vot diya kyonki congress party ne muslimon ko dhokhaa diya or pichley 60 varsho se samudaay ko andhere main rakhaa
 Bukhari said, "the Congress promised me that an FIR would be lodged in the Batla House case in return for supporting the Congress candidate
 parantu koi praathmiki nahin darj kii gai, samudaay ko dhokhaa diya gaya he
 i voted congress ke khilaaf maine ek dharmanirpeksh party ko vot diya kyonki main bhartiya janata party ko vot nahin de saktaa
 The Congress and other parties have used Muslims only
 "yah puche jane par ki vah musalamaanon se kise vot dene kii apil karenge shahi imam ne kaha, "maine musalamaanon se koi apil nahin kii ki ve kise vot den
 Muslims themselves must choose who is best for them
 main sabhi musalamaanon se apil karata hum ki ve vot den kyonki loktantr main sangharsh kaa yah sabase bada hathiyaar he
 "he said that for the last 60 years, the minority community has voted for many parties that identify themselves as secular
 par iske badale main use sirf upeksha mili
 Now Muslims need to become a political force

 During the 13th over of the Pakistani innings, both of them were warned to run in the Danger area
 pari ke 18wein over main isi kaaran pakistan ke khilaaf penlti ke taur par 5 ran die gaye
 After the last ball of the innings, once again 5 runs were given as a penalty against the Pakistan team
 iske myne yah hue ki pakistan team ne bhale hi 20 over main 133 ran kaa score banaaya lekin bhartiya team ko nirdhaarit over main jeet ke liye keval 124 ran banane kii jarurat thi
 Even before the first ball was bowled by the Pakistani team, 10 runs were added to the Indian team's account
 pakistan team kii ore se pehali gend phenke jane ke pehle hi bhartiya team kaa score bina wicket khoe 10 ran ho chukaa tha
 Pakistan team captain Zaveria Khan said, "I spoke to the umpires about this, they told me that they had already warned the batsmen three times and after that they gave penalty runs against the team

 uttar pradesh main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liesamajawaadee party(sapa) ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar chal rahi charchaa ke bich congress ne uske saamne 100 siten or upmukhyamantri pad kii maang rakhi he
 In UP, the real contest is being considered between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
 haalanki notebandi ke baad upi ke badale chunavi samikarnon main congress ko apni badi ahmiyat kaa ehsaas he
 According to media reports, the Congress wants to show itself as a strong contender by claiming the post of Deputy Chief Minister in the state
 notebandi ne badla upi kaa samikarancongress netaaon kaa maananaa he ki modi sarkaar ke notebandi ke faisle or uske baad logon ko ho rahi dikkat ke chalate chunaav kaa plot badal gaya he or bijepi ko iskaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 The party believes that in such a situation it has become more relevant for the SP and the BSP
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, 'sapa netritv jaanati he ki congress ko saajhedaar banane par use bijepi or bispi ke khilaaf yadav-muslim votaron ko ekajute karne main madad milegi
 In the same way, if the BSP also contests with the Congress, it will also help in mobilizing the dalit-muslim voters
 ' vah saath hi kehete hai, 'haalanki, abhi ham sirf sapa se baat kar rahe hai
 'congress can make or break sports' Another leader associated with the Congress, pointing to its importance in the election summer of UP, said that even if the Congress contests alone in UP, it may not win 100 seats, but this will give SP and BSP The game can be bad
 haalanki yahaan yah baat bhi dhyaan dene vaali he ki rahul gandhi ke netritv main upi main congress ko dobaaraa ubhaarne ke liye lambey samay se chal rahi koshishen safal nahin ho pai he or aise main party ko lag rahaa he ki use yahaan bijepi ko haraane par jor lagaana chahie
 Due to these reasons, he is also under pressure to combine with the SP or BSP, the two big forces of the state
 sapa se gathbandhan kii lambey samay se chali rahi parade ke peeche batsamajawaadee party or congress ke bich gathbandhanke liye parade ke peeche kaaphi lambey samay se baatcheet chal rahi he, tabhi yah charchaa thi ki congress rajya main 100 siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 However, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav said on November 9 that his party was not going to tie up with anyone
 tab yah mana gaya tha ki mulaayam ne yah bayaan media kaa dhyaan gathbandhan kii charchaa se hataane ke liye diya tha
 Samajwadi Party wants to contest 300 seats out of the total 404 seats in the state and the remaining seats of Congress, Ajit Singh, according to the news that is coming from the political circles of SPP, wants to contest 300 seats in UP
 Ready to give to allies like RLD and some smaller parties

 The meeting of NCP and Congress (congress) between the ongoing agitation for forming the government in Maharashtra has ended
 is baithak ke baad elaan kiya gaya he ki maharashtra main 'shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar banegi'
 Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan said, 'the discussion has been positive
 ham maharashtra main sthir sarkaar denge or ham sarkaar banaaenge
 At the same time, the Congress has said that there is still some discussion left, it will be completed in a day or two
 is dauraan ensipi ke pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha, 'hamane sabhi binduon par charchaa kii
 'let us tell you that before the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, many speculations were being made but now the situation in Maharashtra seems to be clear
 isse pehle congress ne rashtravaadi congress party pramukh sharad pavaar or shivasena ke saath alag-alag baithak kii thi
 Explain that Congress President Sonia Gandhi was not in favor of joining hands with the pro-hindutva Shiv Sena, Shiv Sena broke its ties with the ally BJP after the Maharashtra elections on the issue of partnership in government, but senior This was after Congress leaders met Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on the sidelines of the congress-ncp meeting at Sharad Pawar's house
 Ket was finding that this alliance is taking shape

 Attending bjp's public defense march program in Kerala on Wednesday, Yogi Adityanath said, 'kerala is constantly witnessing political violence and is being sponsored by the state government
 ’yogi ne yahaan kareeb 10 kilometre tak padayatra kii
 BJP President Amit Shah also took 10 km on the first day

 At the same time, the Congress and the CPM have strongly condemned Yogi for the Kerala tour
 congress ne tanj ksaa ki yogi kerala isliye gaye, kyonki bijepi ke mutabik vahaan kanoon vyavastha kharaab ho gai he
 However, the reality is that Uttar Pradesh is burning and curfew is imposed in nine districts of the state

 haalanki bangaroo lakshmana ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 After this, Sushila Bangaru, wife of Bangaru Laxman, was made BJP candidate in Jalore in 2004 Lok Sabha elections

 sapa ne loksabhaa chunaav main aapasi gathbandhan kii naakaami ke baad basapa pramukh mayawati ke talkh bayanon par palatwaar karte hue ravivaar ko kaha ki janata basapa kii asaliyat jaanati he or uttar pradesh ke aagaamee vidhansabha upachunaav main vah use jawaab degi
 sp's national spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said on a question that even though the BSP chief is calling the SP bad, the public knows his reality
 basapa pramukh ke bayanon par sapa adhyaksh kii koi pratikriya nahin aane ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki pradesh kii 12 vidhansabha siton ke liye hone vaale upachunaav main janata basapa ko jawaab degi
 Chaudhary said that his party has started preparations for the by-election and will fight with full preparation against all the opponents including SP BSP
 gauratlab he ki sapa or basapa ne haal main sampann loksabhaa chunaav aapasi gathbandhan karke ladaa tha
 However, this alliance was not achieved as expected
 basapa ko 10 or sapa ko paanch siten mili thim
 The BSP could not win a single seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 baharhaal, mayawati ne pichley dinon basapa kii ek baithak main sapa se gathbandhan ko nuksaandeh bataate hue ise khatm kar diya tha or bhavishya main sabhi chunaav apane balboote ladane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Let me tell you, in the recent Lok Sabha elections, 11 mlas of the state have become mps
 inamen se aath vidhayak bhaajapa or ek-ek vidhayak sapa or basapa ke hai
 These seats include Rampur, Tundla, Iglas, Gangoh, Jalalpur, Zaidpur, Balha, Lucknow Cantt, Govind Nagar, Pratapgarh and Manikpur

 arun jetali se bhidana kabhi dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko baari pad gaya tha
 When Arvind Kejriwal had to apologize to Arun Jaitley in a defamation suit
 kejariwal sahit aam aadmi party ke 6 netaaon ne 2015 main arun jetali par dilli jila cricket association (didisie) main bhrashtachar karne ke aarope lagaae the
 On which Jaitley dragged Kejriwal and his party leaders - Kumar Vishwas, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadha, Ashutosh and Deepak Bajpayee to the court for a defamation case of Rs 10 crore
 ram jethmalani jaisaa vakil karne ke baad bhi arvind kejariwal ko raahat nahin mili thi
 Rather, during the trial in the court, Jethmalani forced Arun Jaitley to face further defamation case by calling him abusive
 buree tarah ghirne par kejariwal ne maafee maangane main hi bhalaai samajhi thi
 Kejriwal made allegations of corruption during Jaitley's tenure as DDCA President from 2000 to 2013
 kejariwal ke maafeename ke baad donon pakshon kii taraf se hoicourt va patiala house court main sanyukt yachika daayar kii gai thi
 What was written in the apology Kejriwal Neshriman Arun Jaitley ji, i made a statement in December 2015 about you and your family, which was about the post of President of your Delhi Cricket Association
 ye maamla philhal dilli hoicourt main lambit hai or dilli ke patiala house court main bhi chal rahaa he
 The statement i made was based on some documents and information provided to me by some people
 haalanki, ab mujhe pataa chal gaya he ki jo bhi jaankaree mujhe mili thi vah sahi nahin thi
 i made allegations against you based on those false information
 isliye mere dwaara jo bhi aarope aapke upar lagaae gaye the, un sabhi ko waapas lenaa chahta hum
 a malicious statement was made by my lawyer Ram Jethmalani in the Delhi High Court during the defamation case hearing, i had no idea about it
 iske alaava aapke khilaaf is maamle main print, electronic or soshal media par lagaae sabhi aarope main waapas letaa hum
 i apologize to you and your family for any damage done to your image by these allegations
 haalanki ham donon donon alag-alag partiyon se jude hue hai
 i believe that now we should put an end to the needless prosecutions on this issue and put our capacity to serve the people of the country

 ab is vidheyak par sansad main bahes hogi or ise paarit karaane ke liye sarkaar jor lagaaegi
 The BJP has also issued a whip to its mps to be present in Parliament for the next three days

 jiske aadhaar par sarkaar baaki deshon se jaruri karrwai kaa anurodh kar paaengi
 But at the same time it will still be a big challenge to deal with the laws of other countries, the security provided to those who take citizenship through those laws

 Mallya holds foreign citizenship due to which the security provided by the law there is causing delay in legal action

 The family's meeting with former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, imprisoned in Pakistan, may be seen as a relief, but Pakistan has once again shown its genuineness with its attitude
 pakistan ne kulbhushan kii maa or patni ke saath jo bartaav kiya or jadhav parivaar ko milaayaa gaya usase pehle hi pakistan ne apni manshaa jaahir kar di thi
 In fact, Indian agencies wanted to send a woman diplomat, along with his mother and wife, who arrived in Pakistan to meet Kulbhushan on Monday

 However, when Jadhav met his family, an Indian High Commission official was present there
 lekin unhen jadhav kii maa or patni kii meeting spot se dur rakhaa gaya
 After the meeting with Jadhav's mother and wife, the spokesman of the Indian Foreign Ministry attacked Pakistan
 pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki suraksha ke naam par kulbhushan kii patni-maa ke mangalsutra, bindi, kapade tak ko badalawa diya gaya
 Whenever Kulbhushan's mother tried to talk to his son in Marathi, he was repeatedly interrupted
 yahaan tak kii unke juute bhi nahin lautaae gaye
 However, on Tuesday evening, Pakistan rejected India's pleas that Kulbhushan Jadhav's mother and wife were harassed
 pakistan ne daawa kiya ki kulbhushan kii patni ke juute suraksha kaarnon se jabt kiye gaye the, kyonki usamen kuch tha
 The Pakistan Foreign Office said in a statement that Pakistan does not want to get involved in the meaningless battle for words and dismisses India's baseless accusations and distorted facts about Kulbhushan's attitude to authorities during his meeting with his mother and wife

 murali vijay ne apane ballebaaji kaushal or ekaagratha kii shandaar misaal pesh karke aaj yahaan shatak jadaa jisase bharat ne prayek satr ke shuru main jatke sahane ke baavjood england ke khilaaf pehle test cricket match ke shuruaati din chaar wicket par 259 ran banaae
 Vijay batted according to the brilliance of the occasion and scored his fourth and first century on foreign soil
 vah abhi 122 ran banaakar khel rahe hai jiske liye unhone 294 gend kheli hai
 His innings included 20 fours and a six
 unke saath captain mahendra singh dhoni (naabad 50) khel rahe hai jinhone din ke aakhri over main apane kariyar kaa 30 ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Dhoni's 64-ball innings included five fours
 vijay or dhoni ne ab tak paanchaven wicket ke liye 81 ran jode hai
 It can be said to be a good start for India as the last time they lost the series 0-4 in England, their highest score was 300 runs in eight innings
 dhoni ne ballebaaji ke liye anukool paristhitiyon main pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya
 India did not start well and lost the wicket of Shikhar Dhawan (12 off 24 balls) quickly
 agle do satr main bhi bharat ne shuru main jatke sahane ke baad sthiti sanbhali
 Cheteshwar Pujara (38) and Virat Kohli (1) were dismissed at the start of the second season while Ajinkya Rahane (32) returned to the pavilion in the first over after a tea break
 england kii taraf se james anderson ne 70 ran dekar do jabaki stuart broad ne 26 or liyaam plunket ne 56 ran dekar ek-ek wicket liya
 Pujara came to the crease to support Vijay and the two moved the innings with ease
 kshetrarakshan chhitar jane ke baad ran banane lage
 By lunch, India had scored 106 for one wicket and looked to be in a very good position
 vijay or pujaara donon ne subah ke satr main duusare wicket ke liye 73 ran jode the jabaki england ke gendbaajon ko sapaat wicket par kaaphi mehnat kerani pad rahi thi
 But after lunch the story changed completely
 anderson or broad ko achaanak hi reverse swing milane lag gai
 Pujara returned to the pavilion in the second over after lunch
 anderson kii teji se andar aati gend pujaara ke balle se lagakar sidhe sili mid aan par khadey ian bel ke paas pahunch gai jinhone apane daayin taraf ek haath se dive lagaakar behtareen kaich lapka
 Pujara was unable to increase his score after lunch
 agle over main hi nae ballebaaj kohli ke out hone se bharat ekadam se baikfoot par chalaa gaya
 Kohli would face the penalty of tampering with Brad's fast-paced ball, which, kissing his bat, went into the safe hands of Bell standing in the second slip
 isse score teen wicket par 107 ran ho gaya
 This situation was not good because India are playing with only six batsmen
 rahane ne shuru main krij par kuch visham pal gujaarey
 Vijay, on the other hand, maintained his patience
 in donon ballebaajon ko england ke donon mukhya gendbaajon ke saamne kadi pariksha se guzarana padaa jisase ran rate gir gaya
 But in the third session, India lost the wicket of Rahane in the first over
 plunket kii short pich gend ko rahane ne pul karne kii koshish kii jo unke balle ke nichle hisse se lagakar sidhe sili point par khadey england ke captain elistare cook ke paas pahunch gai
 Rahane was unable to add any runs to his score in the third season
 vijay ne phir apane jazbe kaa pradarshan kiya or khud par dabaav nahin banane diya
 However, he slowed down after reaching close for a century
 duusari taraf dhoni ne shuru main gendon ko parakhane ke baad apane shot khilne shuru kiye
 Vijay completed his century by flicking Anderson to square leg and taking a run
 yah trentbrij main test cricket main 100waan shatak bhi he
 After this, Vijay also sent Moin Ali for six runs
 dhoni ko sapaat pich par khilne main dikkat nahin hui
 He completed a half-century in the last over of the day, setting a new record for India to score more than 50 times as captain
 yah 26waan avasar he jabaki unhone captain rahete hue 50 se adhik kaa score banaaya
 Dhoni broke the record of Sunil Gavaskar (25)
 isse pehle bharat ne paanch gendbaajon ke saath khilne kaa faisla kiya or stuart binni ko test cricket main padaarpan kaa mauka diya
 For this, Rohit Sharma was excluded
 vah purv cricketer or vartmaan chayankarta roger binni ke bete hai
 This father is the tenth pair of father and son playing Test cricket for India

 bulandshahr sadar se vidhayak aleem choudhary kii patni rehana kii murder mistry sulajhati najar aa rahi he
 During the investigation, Delhi Police arrested Nadeem, the driver of the mla's business partner, and inquired that the murder was carried out by Anas and Danish, two sons of MLA Alim's first wife
 driver ne poochtacha main bataaya he ki murder kii raat wo anas or danish ke saath rehana ke ghar main daakhil hua tha
 The car was taken by Nadeem to Rehana's house
 rehana ke saath ghar main kuch der baithne ke baad danish ne pehle rehana ko goli maari or phir danish ne chaakuon se 12 waar rehana ke jism par kiye
 Nadeem was to be given 5 lakh rupees for his involvement in the murder

 Police say that Haji Aleem did not pay attention to his first wife's sons, while Rehana had all the property, love and money and this is the reason for the murder
 police ab bhale hi murder ke is maamle ko sulajhaa lene kaa daawa kar rahi ho lekin ye jaanch sawaalon ke ghere main he
 The question is - why was the driver of the mla's business partner involved in the murder? Is there any business scope in this case of murder? Where are the two sons of the mla's wife? Why did the police not interrogate them in the initial investigation? Apparently the answers to these serious questions of this murderous murder are with the two people who are still absconding and the police are considering them as murderers is

 He has more faith in his character and his hard work than his form
 role chaahe chota ho yaa bada, usamen chunauti or romaanch hona chahie
 This was the reason that Chadha was not deterred from acting in Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ramlila with Deepika Padukone and Supriya Pathak
 jaisaa ki shweta treepathi kahati hai, “parade par mere kirdaar kii avadhi ne mujhe kabhi pareshaan nahin kiya
 You want to be remembered for your character because you have done justice to him
 ”nae daur kii ye nayikaayen diler bhi hai
 Following the accolades and two awards Masan received at the Cannes Film Festival, Chadha posted a picture on Twitter showing him his middle finger to his opponents
 ve kahati hai, “yah pratikriya un logon ke liye thi, jo aapako gyaan dete hai ki alag kism kii, choti bajet kii or naach-gane se khaali filmon main kaam na karo
 “the dividing line between commercial and independent cinema is becoming blurred
 deepika padukon, kangana ranot, priyanka chopra or anoushka sharma jaisi nayikaon ko bhi ab nayakon kii baahon main jhulana raas nahin aata
 That is why in NH 10, Anushka Sharma's character is seen as a vengeful and angry wife
 piku main deepika aisi aaazaad, aatmanirbhar yuvati ke rup main dikhti hai jo apni nijee or peshewar jindagi ke bich santulan kaayam karne kii jaddojahad main he
 At the same time, Kangana of Tanu Weds Manu Returns looks completely changed
 box offis par in filmon kii kamyaabi ne is vichaar ko majboot kiya he ki ek abhinetri kitni shashakt ho sakati he
 That is why actresses like Nimrat Kaur (the Lunchbox) and Huma Qureshi (dedh Ishqiya) are still left and despite being less well-known, the filmmakers appear willing to try them
 haalanki nae daur kii zyaadaatar nayikaon ne choti or swatantra filmon se naam kamaaya he, lekin ve is jarurat ko bhi samajhati hai ki apana dayera badhaayaa jaae or kisi khaas kism ke cinema main bandhakar na rahaa jaae
 Chadha says, "in this industry, we are really oppressed, because many seals have been stamped on us according to many things
 ham commercial, arty, glamer rahit, sexi
 
 
 And what are the details kisi se milane se pehle hi itane saare filter laga die jate hai
 "I have never had an image," Apte says
 main kisi chhavi ke chakkar main nahin hum or ummid he ki aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 "the waiting game is from Pune, then like Chadha, Tripathi grew up in Delhi too
" filmi duniya se unka koi sampark nahin tha
 Now Mumbai is his second home
 lihaaja ye nayikaayen khud hi apni godfadar hai
 That is why patience and flexibility are very important in their case
 chaahe vah kisi dream project par dastakhat karne kii baat ho yaa apni film ke relies tak kaa intjaar
 Tripathi is familiar with all these methods
 enieft se snaatak treepathi ne digni ke sho kya mast he life main kaam kiya
 The first film he got in Haramkhor 2013 was directed by new director Shlok Sharma
 navazuddin siddiki isamen nayak hai
 The film has been screened at international film festivals
 bharat main abhi iskaa pradarshan hona he
 Tripathi does not like to live in Andheri, where many film people live because every person asks the same question when living there, "what else is going on?" She says, "it is difficult to get the job you want to do anyway
 vigyapanon ke maamle main bhi chunanaa padataa he
 This means that your work is never easy
 ”industry ke anukool banane kaa matlab he ki aap khel ke kuch shaashvat niyamon ko sweekaar kar len
 Walking on the red carpet at fashion shows and attending parties is as important as making an appearance at international film festivals
 treepathi kahati hai, “main shaayad hi kabhi kaajal lagaati thi
 Leave makeup at all ab maine car main bhi mechap karnaa sikh liya he
 i used to think that my talent would be enough, but how you look in this industry is also very important
 ”santulan sadhnaatay he ki ye abhinetriyaan chaalu kism kaa cinema nahin karengi
 She will also make a conscious effort to play a meaningful character
 masaan main treepathi agar chulbule kirdaar main aakarshith karti hai to haramkhor main ve 15 saal kii ladki kii bhoomika main aapako chaunkaa dengi, jiskaa prem umr main kai saal bade teacher (siddiki) ke saath he
 After the release of The Lunchbox, Nimrat Kaur waited for a challenging role for a year
 phir unhen airlift main akshay kumaar ke saath role mila, jo 2016 main relies hogi
 During this time, Chadha played a dancer in Pooja Bhatt's next film, Cabaret
 cor or chaddha jaisi abhinetriyon ko mukhyadhara ke cinema main lene kii filmkaaron kii taiyaari bataa rahi he ki hindi cinema kin raaston se badal rahaa he
 Despite this, independent cinema is the only place where these heroines will feel most comfortable
 sudhir mishra kii film or devdas main chaddha ne kaam kiya he or kalki kochalin ke saath ve jiya or jiya main bhi najar aaengi
 Qureshi can be seen in the Indian version of the popular US horror film Oculus and Gurinder Chadha's Viceroy's House
 apte bhi kaaphi vyast hai
 She will appear in Ajay Devgan Production's film Parched, which is to be shown at the premiere of the Toronto International Film Festival
 saath hi ve tamil superstar rajnikant ke saath bamberiya kii shooting shuru karne vaali hai
 She knows that success is a very delicate thing
 ve kahati hai, “mujhe nahin lagata ki sangharsh kabhi khatm hota he
 You struggle for your share first, then to keep finding it
 phir sangharsh is baat kaa hota he ki aapaki koi chhavi na banane paae
 i think stability is a more important thing
 agar thodi-si bhi mil gai to khush rahuungi

 Water was also being looted in Bundelkhand, once a stronghold of dacoits
 yahaan ke chitrakoot dham mandal main pani ke sankat se darjanabhar gaavon ke log pareshaan hai
 There are pipe lines in these villages, but the water from those pipe lines is looted
 darjanabhar gaanvon kaa pani maatr teen gaanv ke log banduukon ke bal par lut lete hai
 The surprising thing is that the government officials who are aware of the situation give a brief answer on the arrangement of water and make people walk
 pani kii rojaanaa ho rahi is lut ke kaaran darjan bhar gaavon ke log pyaase mar rahe hai
 The condition of animals and birds is more or less the same here
 bandajal santhaan bhuragarh se jude gusayari, fatepur, kapasa, tikri, chaandi, bhabhai, biharka, ichaili or nayak purava gaavon ke logon ko pani kii baari killat se jujhna pad rahaa he
 Despite the laying of water tanks and pipelines in these villages, people here have not had a drop of water for almost a month
 kshetra ke graminon kii maane, tobandajal santhaan bhuragarh se chaalu hone vaali pani kii tankiyon ke sameep sthit teen gaanv goyara, achharod or mohanpurva ke log pani lut lete hai
 They carry guns with them, so no one can muster the courage to oppose them
 graminon ne bataaya ki pani luutane or uski killat hone kii shikaayat maudaha tehsil ke tehseeldaar se lekar jiladhikari hamirpur,chitrakoondham mandal kii ayukta or rajya kii sattadhari samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke rashtriya mahasachiv or rajyasabha saansad vishmbhar prasad nishad se lekar mandaleey abhiyantaa tak se kii gai he
 But nobody bothered to know his problem
 kuch graminon ne to yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki bhuragarh sthit mandaleey jal santhaan ke jis bindu se pani kii supplai shuru hoti he, vahaan ke kanishtha abhiyantapani ke badale rishwat kii mangakarte hai
 This is just a hallmark of the problems being faced by the people due to the domination of the bullies in the country
 is gaanv ke pani ke sankat or adhikariyon kii andekhi kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pyaas ke kaaran yahaan par abhi tak kai pashu-pakshiyon kii jaan chali gai he
 The truth is that the villagers have to buy water at the rate of two rupees per liter to save their lives
 alam yah he ki yahaan ke log pani milane ke kaaran hone vaali bimariyon kaa shikaar ho rahe hai or unhen mahamari kaa dar sata rahaa he

 The defense minister took security, seeing such preparations, it seems that Pakistan and China are not doing any new trick
 mana ja rahaa he ki is khufia report ke baad rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman abtak teen baar in ilaakon kaa daura kar raksha taiyaariyon kaa jayja le chuki hai
 Pakistan is not only building bunkers with the help of China, but also building infrastructure such as defense canals, swamps and road networks in these areas
 pakistan ke gabbaar or chawlistaan sector main nae biopi kaa nirmaan kaaphi teji se ho rahaa he
 According to Indian intelligence agencies, the stones that are being used for bunkers are not found in these areas
 registan main safed or pile pathar hote hai, jo barish main ghul jate hai or kamjor ho jate hai
 In such a way, China is preparing a bunker with such stones which cannot dissolve
 inaki oonchai itani rakhi gai he ki ye ret main dab nahin sakate
 Pakistan's anti-terrorism court on Wednesday framed charges of "terror funding" against Hafiz Saeed, the main conspirator of the Mumbai terror attack
 aatankwaad virdohi adaalat ke nyaayadhish malik arshad bhutta ne said or uske saathiyon par punjab praant ke vibhinn shaharon main ‘‘teror funding'' kaa aarope tay kiya
 Earlier on Saturday, the court could not frame charges against Hafiz Saeed for financing terrorism as authorities had surprisingly failed to produce a co-accused in this high-profile hearing on Saturday
 punjab police ke aatankwaad nirodhak vibhaag (CTD) ne said or uske sahyogiyon ke khilaaf ‘‘teror funding'' ke aaropon main punjab praant ke vibhinn shaharon main 23 praathmiki darj kii thim or jamaat -ud-daawa pramukh ko 17 july ko giraftaar kiya tha
 He is currently lodged in Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore
 hafiz said ke uparlahore, gujranvala or multan main al-amphal trust, daawatul irshaad trust or muaaj bin jabaal trust sahit trust yaa gaiyr-laabh sanghathanon (enpio) ke naam par banaai gai sampattiyon ke madhyam se aatankwaad ke vittaposhan ke liye dhan ekatrit karne ke liye maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 It is believed that under the pressure of the international community, Pakistani officials have used the lashkar-e-taiba, jamaat-ud-dawa and the entity-run falah-e-insaniyat Foundation (FIF) to use their assets and trusts to finance terrorism
 Is investigating said ke jamaat-ud-daawa ko lashkar kaa pramukh sanghathan mana jaataa he, jisane 2008 main mumbai main aatankwaadi hamalon ko anjaam diya tha
 166 people were killed in the Mumbai attack
 instent miseging ap whatsapp main kuch nae fitures aae hai
 The company has released an update that includes new features along with bug fixes
 die gaye mukhya feechar kii baat karen to ab aap delit kiye gaye media files ko bhi downlod kar sakate hai
 Whatsapp's new feature 2 after a report by wabetainfo
 18
 106 and 2
 18
 The version between 110 is given
 aapako bataa den ki jab bhi koi aapako photo, video, jif image yaa koi documents whatsap par bhejtaa he or aap use whatsap foulder se delit kar dete hai, to iske baad aap dubaara ise waapas nahin paa sakate the
 Now this has been changed in the new update and you will be able to download the deleted files as well
 delit kiye gaye files aapako dubaara downalodkarne kaa feechar mil rahaa heiskaa matlab kya he? matlab saaf he ki aapke files delit or downlod hone ke baad bhi watsap ke sarwar par rahenge
 Earlier, the terms were that if the file you have not downloaded remains available for 30 days and whenever the receiver downloads the file, the server deletes it
 aise samay main jab fasebuk privesi ko lekar lagaataar sawaalon main he, mark jakarberg lagaataar logon se maafee maang rahe hai
 In such a situation, the new update of whatsapp may seem strange to some people, because the longer the information about the users is stored on the server, the more the threat is on the privacy
 
 According to reports, whatsapp recently changed its behavior in this and when the media file is downloaded by the user, it will still remain on the server
 yujar ke delit karne ke baad whatsap phir se use yujar ko degaa
 For example, you can download the whatsapp media files you deleted 2 months ago
 haalanki media files phir se downlod karne ke liye aapke paas sender kaa massej hona chahie

 The police has started investigating the case
 doshi par karrwai kii jaaegi
 People at the Diva, Mumbra or Kalwa local railway station, holding water jars in their hands, surprise the outsiders, but the rest of them know that this body is carrying water on the head, beside and in the hand as soon as possible
 There are nothing more than puppets dancing on every drop
 ye log apane ghar se pani kii talash main nikalate hai, train pakadte hai or koi mandir, baavdi yaa aisi koi jagah jahaan pani mil jaae vahaan pahunch jate hai
 As soon as the summer starts, water cuts have started in the areas of Thane and Navi Mumbai adjacent to Mumbai
 thane, mumbra, kalava, deeva or navi mumbai main pichley maheene se 40 fisadi pani kii katautee shuru kar di gayi thi
 The municipality says that the availability of water is extremely low and this deduction is necessary to keep the remaining water running till it rains
 pani katautee kii yah sthiti or bhayaavah hone vaali he kyonki buudhvaar se hi 60 ghanton ke liye in ilaakon main pani kii supplai puri tarah band rahegi
 People are desperate for water
 alag alag tarah se pani kaa prabandh karne main lage rahete hai
 One has to stand in queues for hours for drinking water
 jahaan ek ore bade ghar baahar ke kaam kaaj nipta kar sidhe pani ke nal ke paas pahunch jate hai vahiin bachche bhi skool se aane ke baad pani kii fikr main lag jate hai
 The most trouble is in areas like Diva, Mumbra and Kalwa
 in jagahon par vaise bhi pani kii kami kii samasya thi lekin is baar shuru hui katautee ne logon kii qamar tod di he
 People have to do different kinds of water for water
 houseing sosayadi main rahane vaale log pani ke tanker kharid ke kaam chalaa lete hai
 But 3-5 out of 24 people living in slums are sacrificed for trying to fill water
 thane or uske aas paas ke ilaakon main yah nazaaraa aam ho gaya he
 The 40% water cut, which started last month, has upset people
 aise main sarkaar or nagarpalika kaa ravaiya or niraash karne vaala he
 The municipality is claiming that efforts are on to provide relief to the people through tankers and borewells
 lekin logon kaa ek bahut bada tabaka ab bhi us sarkari madad ke intazaar main he
 The comments pani kii katautee shuru hote hi pani kai guna mahangaa ho gaya he
 The prices of water tankers have gone up
 log isaki shikaayat kar saken iske liye nagarpalika ne toll free nambar uplabdh karaayaa, lekin us nambar par shikaayat sunne vaala koi nahin miltaa
 Thane Collector Ashwini Joshi says that the helpline number is not working due to some technical fault
 pani kii is maramari ke bich thane nagarpalika aag lagane par kuna khodne kaa ravaiya apanaati hui nazar aa rahi he
 Thane, which is facing shortage of water, is called the city of lakes where about 30 lakes and 500 borewells are present
 lekin in jhiilon kaa rakh rakhaav kabhi is tarah se kiya hi nahin gaya ki aisi sthiti main is pani kaa istemaal ho sake
 And now when the matter seems to be getting out of hand, the municipality wants to start from the beginning
 is pani ko logon ke liye uplabdh karwaane par nagarpalika ab vichaar kar rahi he
 The rains have almost two months to come and till then the people have no answer for what solution the people have for this problem
 garmiyaan shuru hote hi mumbai se sate thane or navi mumbai ke ilaakon main pani kii katautee shuru ho gayi he
 In Thane, Mumbra, Kalwa, Diwa and Navi Mumbai, 40% water cut was started since last month
 nagarpalika kaa kahana he ki pani kii uplabdhta behad kam he or is bache hue pani ko barsaat hone tak chalaane ke liye yah katautee zaruri he
 This situation of water cut is going to be more frightening because the water supply will be completely closed in these areas for 60 hours from Wednesday itself
 log pani ke liye behaal hai
 They are engaged in arranging water in different ways
 pine ke pani ke liye ghanton kataron main khadaa rahanaa padataa he
 While on one hand the big houses deal with the work outside and reach the water tap directly, the children also take care of the water after coming from school
 sabase zyaada takaleef divaa, mumbra or kalava jaise ilaakon main he
 There was a problem of water scarcity in these places anyway, but this time the cuts have broken the back of people
 pani ke liye logon ko tarah tarah ke jatan karne padate hai
 People living in housing society carry on the task of purchasing water tankers
 lekin jhuggiyon main rahane vaale logon ke 24 main se 3-5 ghante pani bharne kii koshish kii bali chadh jate hai
 The scene has become common in Thane and its surrounding areas
 pichley maheene shuru hui 40 fisadi pani katautee ne logon kaa haal behaal kar diya he
 In such a situation, the attitude of the government and the municipality is further disappointing
 nagarpalika daawa kar rahi he ki tanker or borwell ke zariye logon ko raahat dene kii koshish jari he
 But a large section of the people is still waiting for that government help
 tippaniyan Water has become costlier by the time water cuts begin
 pani ke tankeron kii keemten bad gayi hai
 To enable people to complain, the municipality provided a toll-free number, but no one can hear the complaint at that number
 thane ke colector ashvini joshi kaa kahana he ki kuch takniki kharabi kii vajah se helpline number kaam nahin kar rahaa
 The Thane Municipality seems to be adopting the attitude of digging a well in the midst of this raging water
 pani kii killat jhel rahe thane ko jhiilon kaa shahar kaha jaataa he jahaan kareeb 30 jhilein or 500 borwell maujuud hai
 But these lakes have never been maintained in such a way that this water can be used in such a situation
 or ab jab baat haath se nikalati hui nazar aa rahi he to nagarpalika shuruyaat se shuru karnaa chaah rahi he
 The municipality is now considering making this water available to the people
 barsaat aane main lagbhag do maheene baaki hai or tab tak logon ko is samasya kaa kya samaadhaan ho iskaa nagarpalika ke paas koi jawaab nahin he

 haal hi main airtel or edia ne apane data chargeej badha die hai
 This move of the telecom companies will have the biggest impact on the smartphone users who use the internet every day
 agar aap bhi kuch aise tareeke dhund rahe hai jinase internet ke istemaal ko thodaa kam kar mobile bill control main rakhaa ja sake to ye tricks tri kar sakate hai
 Smartphones have some data Hungarian apps, i
e
 apps that use your mobile data more and also consume more battery
 data yuj ko kam karne kaa daawa karne vaale dheron ap aapako mil jaaenge par lagbhag sabhi ap aapke mobile ko slo karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Such apps are infested with malware that hangs the phone as well
 ham aapako kuch tricks bataa rahe hai jisaki madad se aap data yuj kam or internet kaa zyada istemaal kar sakate hai
 For this you will not need any third party app because the money will save itself
 krom broujar kaa data sever on karen:kya aapako pataa he ki mobile ke krom broujar main data sever kaa opshan bhi he
 You should go to Chrome browser settings and turn on 'data Saver' which is already off
 ye webpej ko compress kar data bachaayegaa
 Facebook Video Play: The Facebook video play option is always on with the Facebook app in the smartphone, so that the Facebook app starts consuming data faster as Facebook opens
 use disable karne ke liye fasebuk ap kholkar uski setting main Videos Auto-play ko of kar den yaa wi-fi Only
 Please do it
 auto apadet hone vaale ap ko disable kar den:kuch ap internet milte hi khud apadet hona shuru ho jate hai
 To avoid this, "do Not auto-update Apps" or "auto update over wifi Only" from Google Play Store settings
 restrict becoground data:android kaa yah feechar data yuj ko kam karne ahm role nibhaayega
 You have to go to the data usage settings of the mobile and select 'restrict background data'
 or phir becoground ap khud band ho jaaenge
 Keep the push content of the app disabled: Chatting app or Facebook, all have push cut option by default
 ap kii settings main ja kar push notification ko band kar den
 And finally, do pay attention to one thing, after opening any app, close it properly and do not leave the app by minimizing it
 in tareekon ko apana kar aap data to bachaayenge hi saath hi aapkaa smartphone pehle se fast bhi hoga

 Himanta Biswa Sarma said that Hindu immigrants should not be excluded from the list
 "hindu pravaasiyon ke ek chote hisse ko suchi se baahar kar diya gaya he
 They had their own refugee certificates, but were not considered
 haalanki bhaajapa agle sansad satr main naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak paarit karne ke liye patibaddh he
 On the other hand, Biswa disagreed that all refugees should be given shelter regardless of religion

 This building is important because the top officials of the National Information Center (NIC), who have implemented the second largest pastime of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ie, Digital India after Netagiri, sit here
 pradhanmantri karyaalay kii website migov ke siio gaurav dvivedi bhi yaheen baithte hai
 It is here that Dr
 Ajay Kumar, Director General of NIC in his office of the fourth floor is busy in handling the files
 kaam sanbhaalane ke baad se hi unka kaam lagaataar badha hua he
 After all, it is NIC that hosts more than 7,000 websites of central and state governments and carries over 9 million email messages every month
 har maheene 25,000 video conferencing ghanton ke jariye sarkaar chalaane main madad karne vaale enisi kaa sara kaamkaaj agar puraane sarvaron se uthaakar cloud “meghraaj” par daalana enisi prabandhan kii badi kamyaabi he to sarkaar kii takreeban roj hone vaali ghoshnaaon ke liye nae eps taiyaar karnaa or i-gavarnence lagu karana vaaki unki chunauti he
 But despite these achievements, NIC is ready to meet the challenges
 kyonki chunauti kitni badi he, ise khud pradhanmantri ne is saal 1 july ko digital india saptaah ke shubharambh ke maukey par is tarah bataaya tha, “vah din dur nahin he, jab sari sarkaar mobile phone main hogi
 But we all have to work for it
 
 
 digital takat ko baccha bhi samajhataa he
 If we do not understand this change then the world will go away and we will be lying in the corner
 ” to kya modi sarkaar vaaki digital ho gai he?sust email or adhuri hajirimodi sarkaar aane ke baad sarkari dacrataron main karypranali sudhaarney ke liye aadhaar card ke jariye biometric hajiri kii pranali shuru kii gai
 But the condition of its success is that a ministry secretary told India Today, “my presence in it disappears many times
 main baaki adhikariyon se kya sawaal karun?” biometric upasthiti pranali zyaadaatar dacrataron main ab tak bharosemand nahin ho pai he
 Although Dr
 ajay kumaar kii daleel he, “biometric hajiri ko 75 fisadi kamyaabi mili he
 Those who do not work willfully reduce it
 ” (dekhen baatcheet) duusari taraf sarkari email pranali bhi sust najar aati he
 Despite the claims of NIC, most government officials still consider it better to use official ID as well as G-mail or other ids
 sarkari websites par bade paimaane par hamale bhi hote rahete hai
 According to a report by the Computer Emergency Report Team (CERT), 1 related to security on nic-linked websites in 2014
 30 lakh maamle saamne aae
 Are such situations safe? On this question, Cyber laws expert and Supreme Court lawyer Virag Gupta says, "after all Hillary Clinter's controversy was about the use of private emails in government work
 ” gaur talab he ki hillari ne america videshi mantri kii haisiyat se nijee email kaa istemaal kiya to sarkari jaankaree main send lagane ke sawaal uthe the
 Government services are truly digital
 Most of the services related to the everyday life that Modi wants to change, are with the state and local bodies
 rashan card, voter aai card, driving license, bipiel card, naregaa kaa job card, makaan kii registry, sinchai kaa pani, bacchon kii padhai or police kaa chakkar, ye saare aise maamle hai, jinamein centre dhanapradaata yaa maarg darshak se zyada kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa saktaa
 Yes, the platform through which NIC has to do all these works is definitely with the center
 iske alaava centre kaa janata se sidhaa sambandh hawaii yatra, rail yatra, hive, inakam tex or passport jaisi suvidhaon ke liye hota he
 In the current Mali situation of the country, the rest of things are connected with the big men, only the rail and road share are common people
 rail main buniyadi suvidhaon main bhale hi koi badlaav na aayaa ho, lekin isamen doraay nahin he ki online tikat pranali pehle se kahin behatar hui he
 The mobile app connected to it has made the information related to rail accessible
 lekin modiji kaa digital india kaa sapana in sevaaon tak nahin simatata
 To have a glimpse of their Digital India, first of all we have to turn to the websites of the Central Government
 websites kii surat badali, sirat nahibgar surkhiyon main rahane vaale mantralayon kii websiton par najar daalen to unke aakarshak bana die gaye home pej kuch had tak digital muhim kaa abhas karaate hai
 Prime Minister's Office, Digital India, Make in India, mygov, Ministry of Information Technology, Jan Dhan Yojana, Mudra Bank, Namami Gange are some of the websites whose homepage, the first page, seems to be changing the virtual face of the government
 lekin hompej se aage badaae par badlaav ghistane lagata he
 For example, beautiful pictures will be found on the "namami Gange" website, but clicking on the online data of pollution in the Ganges will not be available
 ganga ke “new project” par clic karen to 2009 main bani ek report saamne aa jaati he
 Yes, donation to the "clean Ganga Fund" has been made easier
 mek in india kii website se koi chota udhyami yah nahin samaj saktaa ki uske liye is mishan main kya he
 Despite filtering the website of Mudra Bank, if anyone wants a loan, he has to go to the bank first, online jugaad will not be seen here
 naagarik udyan mantralay bhi puraani reporton ko hompej par daalkar digital india kii itishree maanata he
 And the Digital India website itself seems to be the hub of a long discourse and another weblink
 sidhe pradhanmantri se judi websites bhi kam dilachasp nahin hai
 One website is pmindia and the other is Migov
 piemindia website pradhanmantri ke bhaashanon ke video or aakarshak mudraon main unki tasveeron se pati he
 Apart from this, he has a detailed introduction, in which he is described as a capital of hope for 120 crore people
 purv pradhanmantriyon ke profile bhi yahaan hai
 But if you want to reach the Prime Minister, then the website will send you to pgportal (website related to public grievance) started during the Manmohan Singh government
 agar aap koi salaah dena chaahate hai to aapako migov kii site par janaa hoga
 Migov is the most preferred site of the Modi government
 is site par 12
 There are 8 lakh registered users
 site par is tarah kii suvidha he ki log sarkaar ke manachaahe vishay par suzav de sakate hai
 Those who recommend a good idea may get praise from the government
 lekin is site par bhi koi vyakti sarkari suvidha paane yaa takalif dur karne kii fariyaad nahin kar saktaa
 Gaurav Dwivedi, CEO of Migov Portal explains, “mygov is not a portal to diagnose problems or provide service
 yahaan policy matters main aam naagarik sarkaar ko behatar suzav de saktaa he
 "but in making law and policy, the government has always been asking for suggestions from the people
 paaramparik rup se yah kaam samachar madhyamon main vigyaapan nikaalkar hota rahaa he, jahaan log patr yaa khud prastut hokar suzav dete hai
 So has mygov not just added a new platform? Dwivedi's flat response to this question is, "yes, it is the platform itself, but here people can see the suggestions of others besides themselves
 ” yani pradhanmantri kii apni site bhi vah kaam karti nahin dikh rahi, jiskaa zikr ve digital india kii avadharana main karte hai
 Hope of hope Despite these obstacles, there are some areas where the impact of Digital India can be seen
 isamen se ek he “jivan pramaan” portal
 The purpose of this portal is to provide online life certificates to pensioners so that they do not have to go to the bank and get stuck in the struggle to prove themselves alive
 5 lakh pensionurs ab tak iskaa laabh uthaa chuke hai
 Similarly, the lost-found Portal, created to search for missing children, is the first platform in the country where anyone can upload information about missing children and security agencies across the country can work on it in Coordinated Way
 sarkari aspataalon main opidi main dikhaane ke liye online booking kii pranali bhi ab gati pakadaaey lagi he
 Presently, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is using it better
 haalanki is pranali kii kuch shikaayatein bhi mili hai, jaise aavedan karne vaale ko aspataal se opidi booking kaa massej booking kii taarikh guzarane ke do din baad aayaa
 People can collect their certificates online through digital locker and this can relieve them from the hassle of getting the documents authenticated again and again
 soochna praudyogiki se jude kanoonee maamalon ke jaankaar supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta sawaal karte hai, “dastavej jamaa karne main sabase badi chintaa data chori kii rahati he
 Trustworthy technology is still far away
 ” is saal july ke ant tak website dephasement ke 13,000 maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 That is, cyber security is still a big challenge
 sanchaar evam soochna praudyogiki mantri ravishankar prasad ne is saal march main loksabhaa main jo aankade pesh kiye unke mutabik, 2012, 2013 or 2014 main kramshah 371, 189 or 155 sarkari websites hack kii gayi
 This July, Anthrox Corporation Ltd
, an arms research arm at ISRO
 kii website hack hone kii baat bhi kahi gai, haalanki baad main paaya gaya ki sarwar kii samasya thi
 The Prime Minister himself had also warned in a speech in the "shasari Sarkar Mobile Phone" that technology is changing so fast that even a boy studying in 10th-12th can clear your entire bank balance
 arabiai ke mutabik, 2013-14 main sibar krime main haikaron ne 78 karod ru

 Now the broadcast of 'PK' on TV also seems to be postponed, as the deal between the channel and 'PK' producer could not be agreed

 lekin raju kahata tha- apni dhyaan khud rakhaa karo
 Akshay Kumar will be the brand ambassador of cleanliness of UP, on the road with CM Yogi, my father died 17 years ago

 But when Raju came in the role of father, it was not known
 jab maine apni beti simer ko padhai ke liye america bheja, to meri beti ne kaha ki kya main akele vahaan manage kar paaungi
 Then i do not know how power came and i told my daughter to take care of herself
