 Editor Arun Puri was reading something
 yah sunate hi unki najar uthi
 There was a twinkle in his eye behind the glasses
 unhone mujhe is par kaam karne ko kaha
 a commentary thus became a story and later transformed into a cover story titled Midlife Blues (march 31, 1989)
 un dinon hamen story kii talash main dur-dur bheja jaataa tha, jinhen ham fishing trip kehete the
 The owner did not have to explain much to persuade his news
 bas halkaa-sa ishaara hi kaaphi hota tha
 Almost the same story is also associated with a story focused on pornographic dances in Hindi films: in those days the influence of sexuality in songs was increasing
 pehle jo geet kabhi halki romaaniat se bhare hote the, unamem ab kahin zyada teevr tareeke se sex kii abhivyakti ho rahi thi
 After interviewing a few dance directors in Bombay on this story (the front body blow was almost a regular feature in his dance direction), i realized that this story is much bigger
 maamla sirf naach-gane kaa nahin tha balki filmein khud ashleel hoti ja rahi thim
 i was told that i should remain in Bombay till the story was completed
 is tarah hua yah ki jise do panne kii story hona tha, vah bhartiya cinema main badhati youniktaa par aavaran katha ban gai
 Film director Shashilal Nair made a very pithy talk about it, “the skill has now reached below the shoulders
 ” us vakt apane abhinay ke shikhar par chal raheen maadhuri dikshit ne bhi isaki pushti kuch aise kii thi, “ab ham apane nitambon se bhaawanaaon kaa pradarshan karte hai
 “earlier this work was done by eyes only
 aruna raaje kii maane to ab camera “stan or nitambon par juum hone laga tha
 "now the focus was not on the person, but on his organs
 ”main 1986 se 2000 ke bich jab india today main thi, us dauraan badlaav sabase ahm shabd tha
 The continuously expanding middle class had started to make its own identity
 puraani maryaadaayen tut rahi thim, nayaa paisa aa rahaa tha
 Joint families were either breaking up or changing
 korporate jagat achaanak ahm ho gaya tha
 The landscape of society was constantly changing
 mahatvakankshaon ne sataha par jagah bana lee thi or unhen use mahatv diya ja rahaa tha
 Psychoanalysts and psychiatrists had grown up in the society like mushrooms
 logon main badlaav aa rahaa tha
 In simple words, the identity of the person was now beginning to separate from his family
 sara maamla ab khud se prem karne or apane liye hi sab kuch karne tak simatata ja rahaa tha
 Gradually uncomfortable taboos were bypassed
 is badlaav kaa ek ahm hissaa youniktaa thi
 i wrote all the articles, including Midlife Blues and Cinema Goes Sexy (november 15, 1991), which were investigating this change
 samaaj main ho rahe badlaav, khaskar badalte yon vyavhaar or naitiktaaon kii ek samaj banane main cinema ek kargar chashme kii bhoomika nibhaa rahaa tha
 It was only a few decades ago when heroines were required to be virgins

 kaamuktha kaa rujhaanayah assi ke dashak ke uttarardh kii baat he jab bade parade par youniktaa kii abhivyakti kaa buniyadi muhaavara hi badal gaya
 Obviously, this must have been the effect of the change coming out in the society
 hamane dekha ki romance ab puraani baat ho chali thi or uski jagah kaamuktha ne le lee thi
 While i was working on sexuality in cinema, actor-director Shekhar Kapur told me that "now the urgency and intensity of the occasion has become more important
 ” unhone kaha tha, “pehali najar main hue pyaar ko chumban tak pahunchane main pehle ek reel lag jaati thi
 Now it is done in a few seconds
 
 
 assi ke dashak main to nayak or nayika ko sparsh karne main hi kai reel khatm ho jaati thim
 "rakratar grew in reality as well, though the most marquee experience was that of Marhoom Rang-director Satyadev Dubey while he was training actresses for a TV serial
" maine jab unase yuva abhinetriyon par apni ek story invejan of starlings (30 june, 1986) ke silsile main ek sawaal poocha, to ve shikayati lahaze main bole, “in “modern” ladakiyon ko main sharmaana nahin sikhaa paa rahaa hum
 They do not know how to be shy, nor do they understand any meaning of this
 ” paradaa ho yaa vaastavik jindagi, prem sambandhon ke panpane main shame-lihaaj kii bhoomika badi taqatvar rahi he
 Shame was no longer a part of women's face
 nirdeshak aruna raaje kii maane to camera bhi ab drishyon main rati kii talash karne laga tha
 She says, "now it is zoomed on the breast and buttocks, focusing on the organs instead of the whole body
 ” raaj kapur ke cameraman radhu karmaakar kii maane to camera dhoort bhi ho gaya tha
 Neither were the men spared
 nayak ab genes pahanane lage
 Seeing the desired bulge at exactly the appropriate places on his body, it seemed as if some color had been sprayed on the body
 yah najaara parade se lekar sadakon tak aam ho chalaa tha
 After this, the shirt was sacrificed
 isaki shuruyaat popai jaisi ubhari hui mansapeshiyon ke dhani salmaan khan ne kii
 Following in his footsteps, Hrithik Roshan and his ilk later came to the screen with some Mahabali carved in the gym
 inaki tarah sicks-pack yaa at-pack mansapeshiyaan bananaa utana aasaan nahin tha, uske baavjood mahanagaron or chote shaharon ke ladke apane nayakon kii nakal karne lage
 Of course, these heroes were also visible to women
 yahaan tak ki shahrukh khan jaise hero ko bhi chahat kii vastu bana diya gaya, jinke maamle main at pack to dur kii kaudi najar aate the lekin uski bharpai karne ke liye kabhi khushi kabhi gam main unhen jalidaar shart pahana di gai (jaise pehle heroinon ko geeli sari pahanaai jaati thi)
 It took him almost a decade to create a body like Mahabali
 2007 main ai om shanti om main ve “dard-e-disco” vaale geet par hi-main main badale hue dikhe
 During this time, the objectification of women had increased further
 sadi kaa ant aate-aate sthiti yah thi ki nayikaayen utana hi badan ughaadti thim jitne ke unhen paise milte the
 Now fleshy sexuality was knocking
 aane vaala daur item girls kaa tha
 Young children In the eighties, the taboos of society and sexuality began to collapse
 udaarikaran ne jab gharon main dastak di, to yah prakriya or tej ho gai
 Now there was a storm of change on small screens and computers and children were not untouched by it
 bacchon kii duniya par sex or hinsa kii chhaviyon kaa kabja ho chalaa thah inamen yon kendrit filmein, amtivi or america tivi dharawahik or unke ghatiya bhartiya sanskaran shaamil the
 This made childhood narrow

 The children were now beginning to look like adults
 haalat yah ho gai ki choti bacchiyon ke liye bina hill vaale juute tak milanaa band ho gaye

 The petition said that the Supreme Court should reconsider its decision and for this a bench of five judges should be set up
 yah bhi maang kii thi ki bench main chif justise ties thakur na hon
 According to the petition, the decision of the Supreme Court is not correct in many ways
 justise lodha panel na to khel ke visheshgy hai or na hi unki siforishein sahi hai
 The Supreme Court formed the panel and outsourced its decision in a way
 bisisiai ke liye sansad main koi kanoon nahin banaaya ja saktaa

 It also demanded that Chief Justice TS Thakur not be present on the bench
 yachika ke anusaar supreme court kaa faisla kai myanon main sahi nahin he
 Justice Lodha panel is neither a sports expert nor their recommendations are correct
 supreme court ne panel kaa gathan kar ek tarah se apane faisle kii outsorcing kii he
 No law can be made in Parliament for BCCI

 Everyone is aware of the arrogance of Congress leader and Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma
 unhone ye kahkar ek or vivaad ko nyotaa de diya he ki ayodhya main giraae gaye babari masjid dhaanche ke shadyantra main bijepi or sapa donon shaamil the
 Beni also described the 84 Kosi Parikrama of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) as a drama of the BJP and the SP, saying it would not make any difference, as both Hindus and Muslims were well aware of the conspiracy and conspiracies of both parties
 benny ne kaha, ‘babari masjid ke saath hi prastaavit parikrama bhi bijepi or sapa kaa naatak he, lekin isse koi antar nahin padane vaala he
 Because both the communities have now fully understood their tricks
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya ki sapa or viechpi ke netaaon main mili bhagat thi varanaa baari bandobast ke baavjood praveen togadiya kaise ayodhya pahunche or ashok singhl ko lakhanu pahunchane diya gaya jabaki unhen dilli main roka ja saktaa tha
 Verma said that he does not understand why BJP and SP together organize such programs around elections on the issue of temple construction in Uttar Pradesh, whereas the number of Muslims in Bengal, Kerala and Kashmir is not less
 is
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sach yah he ki uttar pradesh kaa maahaul sapa or bijepi ke kaaran hi tanavagrast or sadbhaav bigaadane vaala banaaya jaataa he
 He said that BJP leader Sakshi Maharaj, who ran a shovel on the Babri structure, was made a member of the Rajya Sabha by SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Kalyan Singh, who awakened the temple, not only included the SP chief but also his son in the cabinet
 Was also included in unhone aarope lagaaya ki bijepi or sapa kii mili bhagat ujagar ho chuki he
 Neither the temple nor the Hindus have anything to do with the BJP and the SP does not care about the Muslims, both these parties have been doing the politics of power only with the help of votes

 unhone match se ek din pehle press conference main kaha ki ham unhen kam score par rokane kii koshish karenge
 It is like the rest of the matches and in this format an easy way to prevent the teams from putting pressure is to take wickets only

 Congress veteran Makhanlal Fotedar died on Thursday
 photedaar 85 saal ke the
 He breathed his last in a hospital in Gurugram
 maakhanlaal photedaar purv kendriya mantri rahe hai
 He has been close to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 unhen raajnneeti kaa chanakya bhi mana jaataa he
 Sonia expressed grief: Congress President Sonia Gandhi has expressed grief over the demise of Makhanlal Fotedar
 unhone kaha, 've apane paanch dashak ke lambey or sakriy raajnneetik kariyar main bina thake or ruke logon ke adhikaron ke liye ladaai ladate rahe or unki seva karte rahe'
 He also said that he was always one of the guide for the Congress
 sonia ne kaha ki unki jagah koi nahin bhar saktaa
 Fotedar, originally from Kashmir, was brought into politics by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru after independence
 iske baad wo congress main sabase majboot netaa ke rup main ubhare
 In 1980, Indira Gandhi appointed him as her personal secretary
 unki hatya ke baad rajeev gandhi ne maakhanlaal ko teen saal tak apane raajnneetik sachiv ke taur par rakhaa
 He later became part of the Union Cabinet
 kashmir vidhansabha main bhi wo kaaphi samay tak rahe hai
 He was an MLA from Pahalgam Legislative Assembly from 1967 to 1977
 saath hi do baar rajyasabha sadsy bhi rahe
 Fotedar has also said many important things about Indian politics and leaders in his book The Chinar Leaves
 is kitaab main unhone jo khulaase kiye hai wo kaaphi charchaa kaa vishay rahe hai
 Despite failing in the Delhi Police recruitment examination, he wore a police uniform but not for the elimination of crime, but by wearing a police uniform he became a criminal himself
 logon ko apni oonchi pahunch or rutabe kaa dhauns jamaakar unase thagi bhi karne laga
 The thug named Robin did not spare his childhood friend either
 usne apane dost ko yah bharosa dilaayaa ki vah dilli police main esai ke pad par karyrat he or vah uske bhai kii railway main naukari lagava degaa
 For this work he also took a quarter and a half lakh rupees from that person
 robin kii vardi dekhakar or baaten sunakar uskaa dost uske jhaanse main aa gaya or bagaiyr kuch soche-samajhe paise de bhi die
 However, Robin's reality is soon revealed to her when she finds her ATM card missing
 tippaniyan Seeing the money coming out of the account, he immediately reported it to the police
 isse sisitivi footage ko dekhne ke baad police is baat ko lekar pukhta ho gai ki yah kaam kisi pulicekarmi kaa nahin balki kisi thag kaa he
 After much effort, the police team finally arrested Robin from Jalandhar in Punjab
 police ab is jaalsaaj se is baat kii padtaal karne main juty he ki is thag ne is tareeke se or kitne logon ko chuunaa lagaaya he
 People also cheated him by bullying his high reach and status
 robin naam ke is thag ne apane bachapan ke dost ko bhi nahin choda
 He assured his friend that he was working as SI in Delhi Police and would get his brother's job in railway
 is kaam ke liye isane us shaks se sava do lakh rupee bhi liye
 Seeing Robin's uniform and hearing his friend, his friend got into the hoax and without giving some thoughtful money
 lekin, jald hi us par robin kii asaliyat jaahir ho gai jab usne apana atm card gaayab paaya
 The comments khate main se paise nikle dekhakar usne isaki khabar fouran police ko di
 After this, after seeing the CCTV footage, the police cemented that this work is not of any policeman but of a thug
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baad police kii team ne aakhirkaar robin ko punjab ke jalandhar se giraftaar kar liya
 The police is now investigating this fraudster to find out how many more people have been looted by this thug in this manner

 ) In Karnataka, the Congress is taking steps forward
 party jaanati he ki chunaav aate hi bijepi har baar ek hi siyaasi ranneeti ke saath maidan main utarati he or congress uski majboot kaat nahin dhund paati
 The difficulty of the Congress is that where it directly encounters the BJP, it lags behind
 lekin kai jagah dekha gaya he ki jahaan bijepi kaa muqabla majboot kshetreey kshatrapon ke saath hota he to wo pichad jaati he
 The Congress feels that in states where there is a small Muslim population, it mobilizes in the same way to surround the anti-bjp parties
 kisi naa kisi mudde ko hawa di jaati he or phir kabhi pakistan kaa naam lekar, kabhimuslim tushtikarnaka naam lekar virdohi dalon ke khilaaf hawa banane kii koshish karti he
 Congress leader Sandeep Dixit cites the example of Delhi, saying that during the elections there, the BJP had associated the Shahi Imam with the Aam Aadmi Party under the same strategy, but Kejriwal seemed wise at the time
 isi tarah bihar main bhi bijepi ne aisi hi koshish kii thi
 It was even said that if the Grand Alliance won, firecrackers would explode in Pakistan
 lekin us vakt lalu or nitish kii jodi ne congress ke saath milakar bijepi ko jeetne nahin diya
 In this context, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee President Raj Babbar says that akhilesh-congress alliance and Mayawati fought separately in UP
 iskaa phayda to bijepi ko mila hi
 At the same time, the BJP also made a lot of statements like diwali-eid lightning and graveyard-cremation
 modi or amit shah ne puri koshish karke chunaav ko sampradayik rang se sarabor karne kaa kaam kiya
 Seeing all this, the Congress took precaution during the Gujarat assembly elections
 rahul gujarat prachaar ke dauraan mandir-mandir gayi, khud ko shivbhakt, janeudhari hindu brahman bataaya
 On the other hand, the inner party campaigned among the Muslims not to react to the provocation and go peacefully to vote
 gujarat main bijepi kii ore se purv piem manmohan singh par pakistani duutavas ke logon ke saath milakar saazish kaa aarope tak lagaaya gaya
 Whereas after the Gujarat results, there was an uproar in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley brushed off saying that no one had any doubt about Manmohan Singh's credibility
 haalanki gujarat ke nateezon ne sabit kiya ki congress kii koshish behatar rahi, lekin wo sarkaar banane main phir bhi kaamyaab nahin ho pai
 In such a situation, the Congress is now taking a lesson from the Gujarat elections
 congress ke mutabik, pichhali ranneeti ke tahat hi jinna or pakistan ke kareeb bataanaa shuru hua
 Recently, Amit Shah told the thinking of Pakistan and Congress close to each other

 There are some important aspects to consider when buying a health insurance cover, which will help in making a wise decision with complete information
 prayek health plan ke alag-alag feechar hote hai or ise kharidte vakt vibhinn plance or unke feechar kii tulana karte hue hi policy kharidni chahie
 Amit Chhabra, Head of Health Insurance, policybazaar
com, is telling what things should be kept in mind while taking health insurance
 aamtaur par jab bhi koi health insurance kharidta he, to vah policy ke premium ke hisaab se sabase sasta plan chunata / chunati he
 Sometimes it is not right to compare health plan on the basis of premium rate only because it is necessary to see the features of the plan
 aksar yah dekha gaya he ki sabase sasta plan simit suraksha pradaan karata he
 An agent can certainly help you in purchasing a health plan, but you should not be completely dependent on it
 isaki bajaay online jaakar policy khareednaa kaaphi adhik madadgaar he kyonki yahaan aap alag-alag plan or unke clem setlement dar kii tulana kar sakate hai
 After this, you can choose the right plan for yourself based on the best features and prices
 ek aam galatfahami yah he ki agar hamen koi beemaari he, to health insurance kharidte vakt isaki jaankaree dena nahin chaahate
 People do this because they fear that their policy application is rejected or the premium amount increases
 lekin yahaan yah jaananaa jaruri he ki jab aap koi clem karne jaaenge or beemaa company ko yah pataa chalata he ki aapane koi jaankaree chhipaai he, to aapkaa clem khaarij bhi ho saktaa he
 You should tell all the important facts related to your health because even though it will increase the premium amount, at least your claim will not be rejected
 yah jaruri he ki health insurance kharidne ke liye premium ke saath hi plan ke fitures kii tulana bhi kerani chahie
 The plans that come with add-ons and rider will be a bit expensive, but you must buy it so that all the expenses related to the hospital can be covered in it
 prayek health plan main shaamil na hone vaali chizon kii apni list hoti he, jo policy dastavej main darj hoti he
 We often ignore it
 isliye ab aapako yah turant jaananaa chahie ki aapke health plan main koun se kharch shaamil nahin he taaki clem khaarij hone par aapako aisa na lage ki aapke saath dhokhaa hua he
 We may be living in the 21st century, but the specter of superstition is still there

 Yu Dongshiyom, assistant professor at the International College of Defense of the National Defense University of the People's Liberation Army, said that if Indian strategists and policymakers think that China will return, they are making a mistake
 you dongshiom ne kaha ki bhartiya sainikon ko bina shart tatkaal waapas ho janaa chahie
 In Xinhua, China's official news agency, Yu wrote that Beijing would not withdraw troops from Doklam, as the region belongs to China, and the 1890 treaty between Britain and China is evidence of this
 unhone kaha, 'agar china abhi peeche hatataa he, to bharat bhavishya main or adhik samasyaayein paidaa karne ke liye protsaahit hoga
 There are many differences between Beijing and New Delhi on many borders, but Doklam is not included
 'agar china apni sena waapas bulaaegaa, to bharat bhi hataayegabharat ne kaha he ki agar china apni sena waapas bulaata he, to vah bhi apane sainikon ko vahaan se hataa legaa

 Be it Bhutan's security concerns or under the guise of protection
 bharat ne apni karrwai ke sambandh main koi kanoonee aadhaar pradaan nahin kiya he
 'india justifying action in the name of Bhutan's defense: According to Yu Dongshiyomu,' India is trying to justify its action in the name of Bhutan's defense, arguing that Doklam is a Bhutanese territory
 agar yahi maamla he, to bharat kaise apane sainikon ko vahaan bhejne kaa daavedaar ban gaya he

 To assess this, till today, when we did a reality check, it was found that if you cannot withdraw more than 10 thousand from a bank, then there is no cash in any bank
 kisi bank main sirf paanch sau rupee hi ek din main nikaal sakate hai
 The team first reached ICICI Bank of Noida Sector 1 for the reality check

 The crowd was absent in the bank
 kuch log paisa nikaal sakate hai, lekin samasya aaj bhi vahi ki ek din main 24 hajaar rupee nahin nikaal sakate
 The money was not found in this bank's ATM

 The team then reached State Bank of India, the largest government bank in Noida Sector 1
 yahaan bhi vahi puraani tasviir dekhne ko mili
 Only five hundred rupees can be withdrawn from the bank in a day
 vahiin bank ke atm main paise na hone kii vajah se logon ne atm kaa shater gira rakhaa he

 This reality check found that even though the demonetization deadline has been fulfilled, the cash shortage continues

 Of these 51 runs were from Suryakumar
 unhone ankit rajput par pehle chakka or phir chaukaa jadkar 34 gendon par is satr kaa teesraa ardhashatak puraa kiya
 The pressure of constantly increasing BCCI run rate was clearly visible on the batsmen and Suryakumar caught the path of the pavilion by waving the ball in the air in an attempt to pull it

 In such a situation it was a strange decision to send Akshar Patel to bat
 karun nair (12 gendon par 23 ran) or akshar (12 gendon par 13 ran) ne chauthe wicket ke liye 21 gendon par 36 ran jode
 The ball once went for six runs in the next three overs, but both batsmen returned to the pavilion in an attempt to play long shots

 To highlight the "duplicity" of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the issue of Narendra Modi, he will publicly release a CD of his speeches in which he has consistently praised his Gujarat counterpart since the 2002 riots
 bijepi or jediu kaa rishta tuutane ke ek din baad bhaajapa netaa susheel kumaar modi ne ‘hamaare paas kai sidi he jisamen kumaar ne saream or khule taur par gujarat ke apane samakaksh ko saraahaa he or tarif main yah baat bhi kahi he ki unki sevaayen or unka netritv desh ke liye laabhakaari hoga

 Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Sushil said that Nitish had not given much weight to the Gujarat riots that had taken place a year earlier during a function in Kutch on 13 December 2003, and said that more than that incident, the state's impressive development was given importance needed

 He said that the PM should have known his statement about Pakistan before criticizing him
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle nasik main ek raily main piem modi ne guuruuvaar ko daawa kiya tha ki sharad pavaar ne haal main ek kaarykram main kaha ki unhen pakistan acha lagata he
 The Prime Minister's allegation was rejected by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 party ne aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri ne pavaar ke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya
 Let me tell you that on this statement of PM, Sharad Pawar said that the Prime Minister said that i love my neighboring country, i have been the Defense Minister of this country
 pradhanmantri ko meri aalochana karne ke pehle mere bayaan kaa pataa lagaana chahie tha
 Pawar said this while addressing a meeting of party workers
 baithak main sharad pavaar ne kaha ki maine kaha tha ki pakistan ke raajnneetik or sainya netaa pakistani raajnneeti main apana dabadabaa banaae rakhane ke liye bharat ke khilaaf jhuthe bayaan dete rahete hai
 These words do not express love for Pakistan in any way
 unhone kaha ki main aage modi kii aalochana nahin karuunga kyonki main pradhanmantri karyaalay kii garima ko thes nahin pahunchaana chahta
 Significantly, Sharad Pawar while referring to Pakistan said that i had received tremendous respect there
 unhone mumbai main ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki mai pakistan gaya hum or mujhe bahut aadar or sammaan mila
 Pakistanis believe that if they cannot meet their relatives in India, then every Indian should treat their relatives
 unhone aage kaha tha ki yahaan log kehete ki pakistani ke saath anyaay ho rahaa he or vah khush nahin he
 While this is not correct
 aise bayaan pakistan kii vaastavik sthiti ko jane bagaiyr sirf raajnneetik phaayde ke liye die ja rahe hai
 The ruling party is only spreading such things for political gains
 bataa den kiyah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab sharad pavaar ne pakistan ko lekar bayaan diya he
 Earlier, Sharad Pawar had said that NCP chief Sharad Pawar gave a strong message to those who start giving free advice to anyone to go to Pakistan
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne sakht lahaze main kaha tha ki jo log muslimon se ‘pakistan jaao' kehete rahete hai ve pakistan or bharat donon ke bare main agyaan tha
 Let us know that former Union Minister was speaking on the occasion of the release of the book 'we the Change' written by senior journalist Sanjay Awate
 sharad pavaar ne kaha tha ki jab alpsankhyak samudaay kaa koi vyakti apni raay jaahir karata he or agar vah raay kuch logon ko pasand nahin aati he to us vyakti se pakistan jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 He is told that he has no right to live in this country
 'unhone kaha tha ki jo kehete rahete hai ki ‘pakistan jaao', aise logon ko pakistan yaa bharat ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 Pawar had said that the Maharashtra government should not tamper with the present reservation by deciding on the Maratha community's demand for reservation
 unhone kaha, ‘essi, asti or obisi ke aarakshan ko nahin chuaa janaa chahie
 He said what is Pakistan? It was a part of India before partition
 jo log us vakt the, sabhi bhartiya the us vakt
 But during partition, people on both sides moved here and there
 unhone kaha tha ki jab main isisi kaa president tha, tab kai baar mujhe pakistan jane kaa mauka mila

 After releasing that song, Deepika went to Jaipur to release her second song
 deepika apni is film ko lekar kaafii utsahit hai or film ke prachaar ke liye qamar kas kar maidan pakad chuki hai
 Generally, old artifacts are shown in the walls of the palace of Jaipur, but for the first time, Bollywood was shown
 is rajmahal main pehali baar 'baji raav mastaani' kaa gaanaa jari kiya gaya

 dewan houseing finance korporation limited (dchaefeel) kaa sankat main funsana puure houseing finance or enbiensi sector ke liye ek nazeer he
 On Tuesday, the company was given a message to the distributors that the company is currently withholding new deposits, renewals of existing deposits and pre-maturity withdrawal (withdrawing money prematurely from investors)
 yah kadam nishchit taur par company main sabakuch thik nahin hone kaa sanket he
 Following this development, dhfl's stock is trading more than 10 per cent down at around Rs 115 per share in Wednesday's trade, which was at Rs 600 per share last year (may 23, 2018)
 beete shuukravaar ko bricowork retings kii ore se company kii credit reating ko ghataakar bibibi plus kar diya gaya
 The question here is that what has happened to the company in the last one year is that more than 80 percent of the investors' capital has sunk? And the company was caught in such a crisis that such steps had to be taken
 escort security ke head (research) asif ikbaal kehete hai, ‘’dchaefeel dikkat main kyon fansi? iske liye company ke bijness model ko samajhnaa hoga
 "companies like DHFL raise capital from the market for a short period and provide loans to consumers for a long period
 companiyon ko puunji mutual fund, bond, diventure, bainkon se lone aadi ke jariye milti he, jabaki company ke upabhokta 20 saal ke home lone yaa bade bilders hote hai, jo lambii avadhi main karj chuktaa karte hai
 Now the problem starts in the company when the sources of the capital start demanding money and the people who have given the loan to the company are not returning from it
 dchaefeel ke saath donon hi samasyaayein ek saath khadi ho gai
 Due to the slowdown in the economy, the demand of housing finance companies also decreased and NPA increased due to non-refund of money
 vahiin duusari ore mutual fund kii ore se bikwaali or bazaar main se paisa nikaalane kii hode ke chalate company par paisa waapas dene kaa pressure bad gaya
 This asset and liability mismatch became a crisis for the company
 notebandi ke baad bainkon main jamaa hue paise kaa bada hissaa enbiensi ko karj ke rup main diya gaya tha
 The problem of DHFL often started in September last year, when Sivan p Mutual Fund saw a huge sell-off in the shares of Dewan Housing, after which the company's stock fell by 40% in one day
 aise halaat main jab company bazaar se paisa jutaney gai to bond or ensidi par zyada byaaj dena padaa
 The cost of funds from the market (cost of funds), the slow pace of return of debt, the exit of investors from short-term capital, the cocktail of all these negative signals has not only helped DHFL but all housing finance companies
 Got into trouble
 nai puunji na le sakane ke kaaran hi company ne pre maior vidrol par roak lagaai he
 The emergence of NBFC companies stuck in crisis will surely be a big challenge for the new government

 unhone kaha he ki sabhi partiyon ke mukhiyaaon va anya varisht padaadhikariyon evam netaaon ko raajnneeti main aane se pehle or uske baad kin kin sroto se sampatti banaai he, unako bhi desh kii janata ke samaksh khulaasa karnaa chahie
 Significantly, with Mayawati filing the form of Legislative Council on May 26, the details of her assets were criticized by the opposing parties and demanded the CBI to investigate the increasing assets of the BSP chief day by day
 mayawati ne kaha ki durbhagyapurna sthiti to yah he ki jo log pratikriyaayein de rahe hai ve khud kharbon kii benami sampattiyon ke maalik bane hue he or aise logo ko apana munh kholane se pehle apane girebaan main jhankkar dekhnaa chahie tha
 He said that leaders of various political parties should also honestly disclose to the public all their acquired assets because in today's situation, usually the heads of political parties and their senior officials and leaders are the owners of trillion benami properties
 Even after this, only few disclose property to the public
 apane mukhya pratidwandi samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav par nishaanaa sadhate hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jab vah raajnneeti main aaye to unke paas kuch bighas jameen or ek cycle ke alaava kuch bhi nahi tha lekin apane raajnneetik safar ke dauraan mulaayam singh yadav evam unke najdiki rishtedaar aaj baari bharkam nami evam benami sampatti ke maalik ban baithe he
 Mayawati said that the same situation is generally seen with the heads, office bearers and senior leaders of various political parties who had nothing compared to today before entering politics but after coming into politics today People have become owners of big industries
 unhone poocha ki aakhir desh main kaali kamai ke bal par raajnneeti chalaane kaa dhandha kya desh ke hit main he
 He clearly said that during the election, whether it is the NDA or the UPA, the leaders of these coalitions had loudly talked about bringing back the black money of the country deposited abroad but after the election, the issue of bringing back the black money after the election was completely silent
 Have gone mukhyamantri ne maang kii ki haal hi main german sarkaar dwaara jin lagbhag 50 ‘safed poshon’ kaa kaala dhan germany ke bainko main jamaa he, unki suchi bharat sarkaar ko saunpi gayi he, unke naam tatkaal saarvajanik kiye jaye or unke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaaye jaye
 Mayawati said that during the Lok Sabha elections, she had clearly stated that if the BSP comes to power at the center, then all the money stashed abroad will be brought back immediately and strict steps will be taken for this
 unhone spasht kiya ki vibhinn raajnneetik netaaon kii tarah unka koi bhi dhan naa to companiyon ke sheyaron main laga hua he or na hi videshi bainkon main unka koi paisa he kyonki vah anya logon kii tarah kaali kamai ko safed karne main vishwaas nahin rakhti or unke paas jo bhi sampatti he uskaa saaf taur par janata ke saamne khulaasa kar detii hai
 The Supreme Court, while hearing a case related to Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi, has questioned the procedure in the criminal defamation case
 court ne is puure prakaran kii khaamiyon ko ujagar karte hue kaha ki aapraadhik manahani ke maamle main na police exiaar darj kar karti he or na hi magistrate kisi bhi tarah se police kii koi report maang saktaa he or na hi jaanch karne ko kah saktaa he
 The court said that the law cannot be different in the case of x and Y
 court ne poocha ki is cese main magistrate ne kaise police se report maangi? However, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, Tushar Mehta argued that the law magistrate can ask the police for investigation in such cases

 The court while highlighting the flaws in the entire case said that neither the police register an FIR in the case of criminal defamation nor can the magistrate ask for any police report in any way nor ask for investigation
 court ne kaha ki kanoon x or y ke maamle main alag-alag nahin ho saktaa
 The court asked how the magistrate sought a report from the police in this case

 The Shiv Sena said on Saturday that LK Advani will remain the 'biggest' leader of the BJP despite not standing in the elections
 party ne gandhinagar seat se bijepi pramukh amit shah ko ummidavaar banaae jane ke do din baad yah tippanee kii
 Advani has been representing this seat
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main ek sampadakeey main kaha ki adwani kii jagah shah ke chunaav ladane ko raajnneetik rup se aisa mana ja rahaa he ki bhartiya raajnneeti ke ‘bhishmacharya' ko 'jabaran ritairement' de diya gaya ho
 "LK Advani is considered to be the 'bhishmacharya' of Indian politics but his name is not in the list of BJP candidates for the Lok Sabha elections which is not surprising," the editorial said
 ' shivasena ne kaha ki ghatnakram yah darshata he ki bijepi kaa adwani yug khatm ho gaya he
 Advani (91) has been the Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
 vah gandhinagar seat se chah baar jite
 Now Shah is contesting from this seat for the first time
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya,'adwani gujarat ke gandhinagar se chah baar nirvaachit hue hai
 'now Amit Shah will contest from that seat
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab he ki adwani ko ritairement ke liye vivash kiya gaya he
 Shiv Sena said that Advani was one of the founding members of the BJP who along with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took the party's chariot forward
 lekin aaj modi or shah ne unka sthaan le liya he
 Already, such an atmosphere has been created that this time the elderly leaders do not get any responsibility
 party ne kaha ki adwani ne raajnneeti main 'lambii pari' kheli he or vah bhaajapa ke 'sabase bade' netaa rahenge
 The Uddhav Thackeray-led party also targeted the Congress, which said that the Gandhinagar seat was snatched from Advani
 shivasena ne kaha, congress ko bujurgon ke apmaan kii baat nahin kerani chahie
 The then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, who ran the Congress government in difficult times, humiliated the party even after his death
 usne 2013 kii us ghatana kaa bhi zikr kiya jab rahul gandhi ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii maujuudagi main ek adhyadesh faad diya tha
 Shiv Sena said, what happened to Sitaram Kesari? In such a situation, respect of the elders does not suit the mouth of the Congress
 congress ke senior netaa digvijay singh ne purv piem indira gandhi or desh ke pehle grih mantri sardaar vallbh bhai patel ko shradhanjali di
 He also raised questions on the intention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this occasion
 unhone kaha ki kyamodiko headgavar, golwalkar or dinadayal upaadhyaay ko bhi shradhanjali nahin deni chahie? yaa unhen aisa lagata he ki inkaa raashtra nirmaan main koi yogadan nahin rahaa he
 Congress leader tweeted

Or he feels they had nothing to contribute to Nation Building ?— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)october 31, 2014 DMK chief m Karunanidhi will arrive in Delhi on Monday to meet his son-in-law in Tihar Jail in connection with the 2-G scam
 vah congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se nahin milenge
 Karunanidhi told reporters, 'I am going to Delhi to meet my daughter on Monday
 ’ sonia se milane ke sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki iskaa mauka milegaa
 Since his party's alliance with the Congress in 2004, he has been meeting Sonia Gandhi every time he comes to Delhi
 karunanidhi ke kal subah dilli aane or kal hi shaam laut jane kii sambhaavna he
 However, it is not clear whether he will meet Kanimoi in jail or in court
 kal unki patni rajati ammal adaalat main kanimoi se milin thim
 The DMK chief yesterday said in a letter to party members that her daughter's only crime was that she was a partner of 'kalaignar TV'
 unhone kaha, ‘yah giraftaar dramuk or mere parivaar se kanyakumari se himalay tak liya gaya badla he
 However, he hoped that he would win in the 'final war'
 unhone kaha ki unhone hi kanimoi ko kalenganor tivi main hissedaar banane kaa suzav diya tha
 The stake was raised through funds from Sun Television Network which were acquired by his wife Dayalu Ammal in October 2005 by selling his stake
 dayaalu ne yah hissedari 100 karod rupee main bechi thi

 The case of the investigation of a missing woman in the national capital Delhi has been stuck for the last eight months
 kyonki jyotishi ne is maamle main 'mahadosh' kii baat kahi he or kaha he ki 19 april ko 'mahadosh' khatm hone se pehle is maamle main kuch nahin ho saktaa
 The case of the woman's disappearance is from Air India employee Sulakshana Narula
 sulakshana pichley saal sitambar se laapata hai
 The investigation into the missing case was handed over to the Delhi Crime Branch, but she still could not locate the woman and she thought it appropriate to wait till the 'mahadosh' was over on the advice of the astrologer
 dilli aparaadh shakha ke adhikari vijay samaaria ke nijee jyotishi ne kaha ki is maamle main 'mahadosh' khatm hone tak kuch nahin ho saktaa or yah 19 april ko khatm hoga
 It is said that Samaria then persuaded Sulakshana's son Anubhav to give her mother's horoscope to her and after that she also showed that horoscope to her astrologer
 jyotishi ne janmapatri dekhne ke baad kaha ki isamen bhi 'mahadosh' he
 The police officer is now confident that he will detect the rectification at any time after April 20
 police jis tareeke se maamle ko le rahi he, usase sulakshana kaa parivaar achambhit he
 Even experience was asked to perform 'upasya' in front of Baglamukhi Devi in chhatarpur temple
 parivaar ke logon kaa kahana he ki 58 varshiya sulakshana ke laapata hone ke maamle main praathmiki darj hone ke baad bhi ab tak is maamle main kuch nahin hua
 The case was transferred to the crime branch in October, but it remains unsolved

 Yana Gupta arrived at a charity event in Mumbai wearing a very short dress
 lekin wo apni blike dress ke andar undervier pahananaa bhul gayi
 Journalists present there also took a photo of Yana without panties
 is ghatana ke baad bollywood main charchaa chal padi ki yana ne yah kaam isliye kiya taaki unki charchaa ho or unhen kuch filmein mili
 However Yana refutes such things
 yana ke mutabik ve ek dance reality sho kii reharsal kar rahi thi or dance karne main takalif mahasoos hone kii vajah se unhone apni panty utaar di thi
 During dance rehearsal, it was time for her to go to the event and she reached the event without wearing panties
 agle din yana gupta kii bina panty vaali tasviir akhabaaron main chhapi to unase poochne waalon kii bheed lag gai
 When asked the question, he gave his response and said that he did not mind it
 yana to shaan se kehane lagi ki wo 'no-panty' girl hai
 Not only this, Yana has started trying to cash in her pictures printed without wearing panties
 yana ne ek akhbaar ko die intravyuu main yana ne kaha he ki behatar hoga wo kisi undervier company kaa vigyaapan karen
 Yana says that earlier she was known only as item girl, now people will come to know her as no panty girl
 yana ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki ab mujhe kisi undervier company ke liye vigyaapan karnaa chahie or mere vigyaapan kii tagaline hon chahie kii dekhon ab maine undervier pahan lee he
 Yana clarifies about not wearing panties, saying, “for the past few weeks i have been practicing for a dance show
 jahaan dance karte vakt main kai baar apni panty se pareshaan ho jaati hum
 She annoys me by getting stuck in my back
 ’yana kahati he ki dance karte vakt camera unhen shoot kar rahaa hota he
 In such a situation, it is not right to repeatedly fix panties in front of the camera
 isliye maine sochaa ki behatar tarika yahi hoga kii main panty hi na pahanuun
 Yana says that on the day of the pictures, after practice, she did not get time to go home and went straight to the charity event
 yana ne kaha, ‘mujhe pataa tha ki maine panty nahin pahani he isile main kuch kadamon ke baad baar-baar apni dress neeche kar rahi thi
 i didn't know it would happen
 mujhe yah bhi nahin pataa tha ki kya dikh rahaa he
 'yana said,' i was able to know what was seen only after looking at the pictures
 kya ab main rone laguun?’film ‘dam’ ke ‘babuji jaraa dhire chalo’ item geet se yana gupta raaton raat lokapriyata ke saatven aasmaan par virajman ho gai thim
 After the film 'dum', she suddenly disappeared from the scene after spreading her flames on several newspapers and magazines
 ab yana chote parade ke jariye phir se sine jagat main vaapasi karne ja rahi hai
 Yana will be seen competing against other contestants in the fourth season of 'jhalak Dikhhla Jaa' aired on Sony
 yana sho ke final tak pahunche yaa nahin ye to baad kii baat he par ye to tay he ki yana jaisi hot item girl ke aa jane se chota paradaa bhi garm hone vaala he
 Although viewers will be desperate to see Yana on the small screen, but she will have to wait
 haalanki yana kah chuki hai ki kisi sho ki shobhaa badhaane ke liye kaam nahin karuungi
 But the thing to be seen is that Jana Jhalak enhances Dikhla Ja's charm or shows something powerful
 vaise yana kaa yah ‘panty’ prakaran ek stant sho bhi mana ja saktaa he khud ko waapas limlite main laane kaa
 Maybe Yana is thinking that this is a better way to remind Yana of the forgotten Yana through such a stunt

e
dtc
 9 se 19 november tak ditisi conductor ne manaahi ke baavjood 500 or 1000 ke note yatriyon se lekar sarkari khajaane main jamaa kara die
 The Delhi government suspects that passengers may have actually given valid notes to the conductor, but this may be the black money of the conductor or DTC officials who were deposited in the treasury with collusion
 tippaniyan When the Delhi government got suspicious, it set up an inquiry into the matter on 19 November
 praathmik jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki ditisi ke 40 main se 20 depo se bainkon main tikat collection ke naam par 500 or 1000 ke avaidh note jamaa hue
 There are a total of 33,647 notes of 1000 rupees and 95,677 notes of 500 rupees, whose total value is 8 crores 14 lakh 85 thousand 500 rupees
 haalanki khud sarkaar maanati he ki sirf conductor is tarah se kaala dhan sarkari khajaane main jamaa nahin kara sakate, kyonki conductor yatriyon se kiraaye kaa paisa vasuul jarur karata he, lekin iske baad kaisier, depo manager or acount vibhaag kii bhi isamen bhoomika hota he
 Transport Minister Satyendar Jain has ordered to hand over the matter to ACB
 dilli sarkaar ko shaq he ki asal main yatriyon ne to vaid note hi conductor ko die honge, lekin ye conductor yaa ditisi adhikariyon kaa kaala dhan ho saktaa he, jo mileebhagat se sarkari khajaane main jamaa kar die gaye
 The comments jab dilli sarkaar ko shaq hua to usne 19 november ko is maamle kii jaanch baitha di
 Preliminary investigation has revealed that out of 40 depots of 40 of DTC, 500 and 1000 illegal notes were deposited in the name of ticket collection in banks
 inamen 1000 rupee ke kul 33,647 note or 500 rupee ke 95,677 note he, jinka kul mulya 8 karod 14 lakh 85 hazaar 500 rupee he
 However, the government itself believes that only conductors cannot deposit black money in the public exchequer in this way, because the conductor definitely collects the rental money from the passengers, but after that the cashier, depot manager and accounts department also have a role in it

 bal thakare ne maharashtra kii siyasat ko lambey samay tak prabhavit kiya
 But now the biggest question after his death is that who will handle his political legacy? Who will further reinforce the tremendous impression he has left in the political arena? Will Uddhav Thackeray, who became the Wildlife photographer from Shiv Sena acting president, take forward Balasaheb's ideology while taking over the reins of the party? Will Aditya Thackeray now be given a big responsibility in Shiv Sena? Or, in the midst of this changing political development, the President of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Raj Thackeray will win the game
 pichley kai arase se bal thakare ke netritv main shivasena ne maharashtra samet puure desh kii siyasat ko prabhavit kiye hue tha lekin ab unke jane ke baad teen logon par nazren bani hui hai uddhav thakare, raaj thakare or aditya thakare
 For the past several years, Raj Thackeray had been working hard to snatch the Shiv Sena's strength from Uddhav, but he could not do so
 lekin ab raaj ke liye mauka he
 The doors of the agreement were opened, although the Shiv Sainiks would definitely want Uddhav and Raj to unite and Shiv Sena to lead them
 votbank kii khatir aisa mumkin bhi he
 According to political analysts, if both parties are not united then it will prove to be quite suicidal for both Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)
 ek baat yahaan gaur farmaane vaali he ki maujuuda sthiti ne uddhav or raaj main samjhaute ke daravaaje bhi khol die hai
 If a compromise is reached, Raj Thackeray can be the face of the party and Uddhav can play an important role in deciding the party's strategy, as he has always done
 iske alaava maharashtra main vah apni-apni jimmedaariyaan baant sakate hai
 One can increase votebank, whatever the decision and rule, but one thing is clear that the politics of Maharashtra will be greatly affected by what they do
 unka ek hona or marathi manus kii asmita ko or aage le janaa unhen ek acha votbank de saktaa he
 At this time, people have sympathy with him
 aise main unke paas maharashtra kii satta main apni jagah banane kaa avasar he
 Congress and NCP may be benefited Political analysts believe that if Raj and Uddhav do not give up their egos and turn away from each other, Uddhav Thackeray is going to suffer more in such a situation
 ho saktaa he ki bal thakare ke kushal netritv ke chalate kuch log chaahate hue bhi shivasena chhod emenes main nahin ja sake the
 Such people can now join hands with MNS
 is utaar-chadhaav se marathi manus vot batenge or pratidwandi party congress or ensipi ko phayda hoga
 The Shiv Sena may be a regional party, but its influence is national
 shivasena ne raajnneetik or saanskrithik soch ke dharaatal par agar apni chhap chodi to yah sirf bala sahib thakare ke vyaktitv kaa kamaal tha
 The sharpness and edge in the Hindutva of Rajathakare suited to the ideology of the Sangh was suited to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
 unke jane se sangh or bhaajapa donon kaa nuksaan hua he
 If there is a choice between Uddhav and Raj, the Sangh can choose Raj
 balasaheb kii anupasthiti sattarudh party ke liye phydemand ho sakati he
 There is also a belief in favor of Dharna Raj that Raj Thackeray can handle the reins of Balasaheb's political legacy better than Uddhav
 raaj thakare kii vichaardhaara, netritv or sanghathanaatmak kshamta or unka vyaktitv is sambandh main kaaphi sahaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 That is, the question is also to handle Balasaheb's Hindutva agenda
 vahiin duusari taraf uddhav kaa udasin, shant va naram swabhaav unke liye ghate kaa sauda sabit ho saktaa he
 He may not be able to become a successful and attractive face of the party due to his personality
 thakare naam kii brands velueek baat ye bhi he ki thakare naam ke bina shivasena kaa vajood nahin he
 It is like imagining the existence of Congress without the name Gandhi
 raaj or uddhav main se jo bhi shivasainikon kii bheed jutayega, vahi sahi myne main 'hindu hriday samraat' ban paaegaa
 Uttarakhand has now announced a year-long visit to the world famous Chotachar Dham

 The government wants that the religious tourism of Uttarakhand can also be linked to wildlife tourism and travelers can see the famous forests and fauna of the place

 Last summer, when Punjab National Bank deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty issued lous for a year to Nirav Modi's companies just before his retirement, his high officials should have been alerted
 lekin pienbi ke ucchadhikari sote rahe
 lous are usually issued for 90 days only to a diamond trader
 bank afasar satark rahete to yah ghotaalaa pehle hi pakad main aa jaataa
 According to the Times of India news, Shetty was the centerpiece of the 11,300 crore Mahaghotale
 shetty asal main yah sunishchit karnaa chahta tha ki saal 2011 se uske dwaara kiye ja rahe is farjivade kii jaankaree uske ritairement ke baad kam se kam ek saal tak kisi ko na ho, taaki vah is bich apane surakshit hone kaa intjaam kar le
 How the matter opened but the matter opened in January this year when Modi's company officials went to the Brady House branch in Mumbai for renovation of the facility
 shetty kii jagah nae aae pienbi ke agxcutive ne LOU yani ek tarah kii guarantee jari karne ke liye company se baari cash margin bank main jamaa karne kii maang kii
 But officials of Modi's companies said they have never given such a margin before
 is khulaase se nayaa bank adhikari chakit rah gaya
 Subsequently, PNB officials launched an internal investigation and eventually a major scam was uncovered
 pienbi ke adhikari yah sweekaar karte hai ki yah vastav main bank ke system kii khami he or bank ko is bare main kaaphi pehle hi sachet ho janaa chahie tha
 The transfer of the scamster was not done, it also raises the question whether there is connivance of some other PNB officials in it, because Shetty was kept on the same duty in the same branch for many years continuously, while according to the rules Shetty Was an officer of Scale-1, so his desk should have been changed every six months and transferred to another branch in three years
 CBS ko SWIFT se kyon nahin kiya conectsaaf he ki pienbi apane hi maanakon ke paalan karne main vifal rahaa
 Apart from this, the biggest question is why the Bank's Core Banking Solution (CBS) was not connected to the International Money Transfer tool SWIFT
 isaki vajah se hi shetty ko apana password istemaal karte hue fund transfar switch ke dwaara massej bhejne main aasaani hui
 This transaction did not show in the core banking software due to lack of interconnection in both systems
 bank se lekar rigerv bank tak ke auditor kii dhilaai!yahi nahin, yah baat hajam nahin hoti ki bank ke kuch hi karmchaariyon ko isaki jaankaree ho, kyonki sutron ke anusaar jab bhi aise aloyu jari hote the, bank ko isaki fees bhi milti thi
 Bank officials should have been alerted only then
 iske saath hi bank ke internal auditor orrijrv bank kiodit team bhi shaq ke ghere main aati he jo samay-samay par bank kii jaanch karte rahete hai

 pehali baar mila to 'bhagwaan' ke pair chhu liekuch patrakaron ne sudhir ko bataaya ki sachin usee din trident hotel main event main aane vaale the
 He kept waiting for them there with his bicycle
 sachin ke aane par wo bheed or security ko cheerata hua sachin kii taraf bhaag vahaan usne pehali baar sachin ke pair chhue
 Sachin invited him to come to his house there
 5
 Sachin fed food On October 29, when he reached to meet Sachin, Sachin not only fed him food, but also gave the pass for the next one-day match
 6
 When the police caught him, Sachin got rid of Sudhir's graduation exam the next time when Sudhir met Sachin
 sachin ne use exam dekar waapas aane ko kaha
 But then India had a one-day match with New Zealand in Cuttack
 usne sochaa ki exam to wo kabhi bhi de saktaa he, isliye wo match dekhne chalaa gaya
 India's condition was very bad
 lekin jab sachin ballebaaji kar rahe the, to wo ground main unke pair chune bhaaga
 He was caught by the police there, but Sachin again rescued him
 7
 Then ran to the ground, the police put him in jail, after this the Indian team performed well in the match held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in Hyderabad, and Sachin also scored a century there
 pichhali baar sachin ne use ground main aise bhaag kar aane ko man kiya tha, lekin sachin ki parformens dekh kar utsahit sudhir phir se ground main bhaaga
 This time the police put him in the Secunderabad police station
 8
 Sudhir's family did not want to get married many times he wished to get married
 lekin sudhir kaa maananaa he ki kyonki uske paas koi job nahin he or koi thikaana nahin he, isliye wo shaadi nahin kar saktaa
 He has dedicated his entire life to cricket
 cricket ke alaava use or kuch nahin sujhata
 9
 match ke chalate bhai-bahan kii shaadi main nahin ja payasirf isliye ki sudhir india ke kisi na kisi match main biji rahaa, wo apane chote bhai or bahan kii shaadi main bhi shaamil nahin ho paaya
 Apart from this, when his sister calls him on Rakshabandhan, he still does not talk to her
 kisi rakshabandhan par wo india ko saport karne bangladesh main hota he, to kabhi srilanka main
 10
 aaj bhi garib he parivaraitani lokapriyata paa chukaa sudhir bataata he ki uskaa kisaan parivaar kaaphi garib he
 The house is so small that even the viewers may find it strange
 deevaaren puraani hai
 Water drips from the roof
 bharosa nahin kab dhah jaae
 Often the radio or TV people call him and take his travel expenses for India's matches
 badale main sudhir unke liye program karata he
 Like every match, his travel expenses are sponsored in this World Cup too
 lekin wo khud koi paise nahin kamata
 What does he believe he will do with the money? Earlier in the train he used to go without a ticket
 pichhlaa world cap jeetne ke baad jab wo train se kolkata ja rahaa tha to titi ne use pakad liya
 TT left him after telling about himself and Sachin
 lekin titi ne jab usase kaha ki aise wo sachin kaa naam kharaab kar rahaa he, tab se usne bina tikat safar karnaa band kar diya
 Like Percy of Sri Lanka, Bashir Chacha of Pakistan, Gravy of West Indies and Larry of Ireland, Sudhir is crazy about his country's team
 lekin aisi tamaam baaten hai jo sudhir ko baaki sab phans se alag karti hai
