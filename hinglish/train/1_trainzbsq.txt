 In fact, Mayawati is beginning to feel that the BJP is eyeing the bsp's core vote bank

 As Mayank Sethi writes, the threat of Mayawati's resignation is merely that of the Khamba cat, a cat cat

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has invited applications for the post of head coach on Thursday, prompting head coach Anil Kumble that his current tenure ending after the Champions Trophy will not be automatically extended

 He objected to statements by RJD leaders Shahabuddin and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, both of which challenged the Chief Minister

 Before that, BJP leader Sushil Modi held a press conference in Patna
 susheel modi ne kaha ki shahabuddin agar jail main rahete hue apharan or hatyaein karvaa sakate hai to baahar aakar kya kya nahin kar sakate
 Crime Control Act should be imposed on them so that they do not work to influence the investigation
 bijepi ke netaaon ne bihar ke rajyapal se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 Meanwhile, you may remember that on 15 May, the Bihar government recommended a CBI inquiry into the murder of journalist Rajdev Ranjan
 sifarish kii chitthee lekar rajdev ranjan kii patni aashaa ranjan pichley kai dinon se dilli main netaaon or mantriyon ke yahaan bhatak rahi hai ki may se sitambar aa gaya or is bich shahabuddin baahar aa gaye

 Does the CBI take over in four to six months after the recommendation of each case
 kya bijepi ke netaaon ne iske liye hangaamaa kiya, kya mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii taraf se hangaamaa kiya gaya ki sibiai jaanch nahin kar rahi he
 Shahabuddin's name is not even mentioned in the FIR registered in the case of journalist Rajdev Ranjan
 is hangaame or raajnneetik ke bich koi yah baat nahin kar rahaa he ki shahabuddin kii zamaanat kaa virodh koun karegaa
 Will bjp's lawyers or Prashant Bhushan do it? prashanth bhushan ne peshkash kii he ki ve zamaanat kaa virodh karenge

 shahabuddin ko lekar nyaaypalika kii bhoomika ko bhi dekhnaa chahie
 The answer should be whether it is true that the notice of the High Court was not served to the prisoner Shahabuddin
 jiske kaaran kai maamalon main trial anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa
 The High Court should be informed and the Law Minister of the State Government should also reply on this
 raajnneeti apni jagah he
 But the question must be asked right
 anya nagarikon kii tarah shahabuddin ko bhi supreme court se faisla aane tak zamaanat par baahar aane kaa haq he
 Even the state government is right
 lekin rajya sarkaar bataaye ki kya yah baat sahi he ki shahabuddin ko hoicourt kaa notice sarv nahin hua
 If not, then who is responsible for this? kisne kya karrwai kii
 It is right for the leaders of the state government and Janata Dal United that anyone has the right to come on bail till the Supreme Court's decision
 bheed ke dabaav main kanoon kii is tay prakriya se chhedchhad nahin honi chahie magar yah bhi tabhi nahin hoga jab log sahi sawaal puuchhenge
 The first is what Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will do to expedite the rest of the cases
 zamaanat kaa virodh karne ke liye mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kya apil karne kii soch rahe hai, agar soch rahe hai to unke jawaab kaa intazaar rahegaa

 Are they being accelerated? agar jaldi supreme court se sunwaayee nahin hui to zamaanat par baahar aane se koun roak saktaa he
 Is everyone waiting for him to come out so that there is politics
 agar sab sirius hai to dilli aakar patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii patni aashaa ranjan ko kyon bhatakana pad rahaa he
 No one has the answer to Chanda Babu's questions

 The coalition is at stake for Shahabuddin
 sawaal he ki daanv par koun laga rahaa he
 For whom it is being planted shahabuddin ke baahar aane kii raajnneeti se kis kis ko phayda he
 According to Shahabuddin, if Nitish Kumar is the Chief Minister of the circumstances, then the circumstances are changing
 iskaa jawaab sirf or sirf nitish kumaar ke paas he
 Keep an eye on them
 ye jawaab nahin he ki unke paas phaltu chizon par dhyaan dene kaa vakt nahin he
 Had Shahabuddin been redundant, the leaders of the JDU would not press Lalu to hold the responsibility of practicing coalition religion

 You understand completely
 usase pehle patna main bijepi ke netaa susheel modi ne press conference kii
 Sushil Modi said that if Shahabuddin can get kidnapped and murdered while in jail, then what can he not do when he comes out
 un par krime control act lagaaya janaa chahie taaki ve jaanch ko prabhavit karne kaa kaam na karen
 BJP leaders have also met the Governor of Bihar
 is bich aapako yaad hoga ki 15 may ke din bihar sarkaar ne patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii hatya ke maamle main sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kii thi
 With the letter of recommendation, Rajdev Ranjan's wife Asha Ranjan has been wandering in Delhi for several days with leaders and ministers saying that May to September arrived and in the meantime Shahabuddin came out
 aashaa ranjan ne 8 sitambar ko kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Even after this, the CBI has not taken the case under its control
 hamaare sahyogi uma shankar singh ne aashaa ranjan se baat kii
 Asha asked Uma to show my interview without editing
 kahin meri baat edit to nahin ho jaaegi
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the BJP and the central government, the three, should answer Asha Devi's questions as to why the CBI did not take over when the CBI probe was recommended on 15 May
 kya sibiai har maamle kii sifarish ke baad chaar se chah maheene main techover karti he
 Did BJP leaders create a ruckus for it, was there a ruckus on behalf of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that the CBI is not investigating
 patrkaar rajdev ranjan ke maamle main jo exiaar darj hui he usamen shahabuddin kaa naam bhi nahin he
 Amidst this uproar and politics, no one is talking about who will oppose Shahabuddin's bail
 kya bijepi ke vakil karenge yaa prashanth bhushan karenge
 Prashant Bhushan has offered that he will oppose the surety
 prashanth bhushan to aage aa gaye hai lekin tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke itane vakil hai wo kyon nahin aage aa rahe hai
 Many lawyers are also associated with BJP
 party main bhi hai or sahanubhuti rakhane vaale bhi hai
 Why did he not say that he would oppose Shahabuddin's bail
 kya shahabuddin ke baahar aane kaa sabhi ko intazaar tha
 The role of the judiciary regarding Shahabuddin should also be seen
 iskaa jawaab milanaa chahie ki kya yah baat sahi he ki hoicourt kaa notice jail main band shahabuddin ko sarv nahin hua
 Due to which in many cases the trial did not reach its end
 hoicourt ko bataanaa chahie or is par rajya sarkaar ke kanoon mantri ko bhi jawaab dena chahie
 Politics has its place
 lekin sawaal sahi poocha janaa chahie
 Shahabuddin, like other citizens, also has the right to come out on bail until a decision from the Supreme Court
 yahaan tak rajya sarkaar kii baat sahi he
 But the state government should tell whether it is right that the High Court notice was not served to Shahabuddin
 agar nahin hua to iske liye koun zimmedaar he
 Who took what action
 rajya sarkaar or janata dal united ke netaaon kii yah baat thik he ki supreme court ke faisla aane tak kisi ko bhi zamaanat par aane kaa haq he
 This fixed process of law should not be tampered with under crowd pressure, but it will not happen only when people ask the right questions
 pehla ki baaki maamalon main tezi laane ke liye mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kya karenge
 What Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is thinking of appealing to oppose the bail, if he is thinking then he will be waiting for his reply
 tippaniyan What is the progress of the cases where the trial court has been sentenced
 kya unamem tezi laai ja rahi he
 If a hearing is not held from the Supreme Court early, who can stop the bailout from coming out
 kya unke baahar aane kaa sabhi intazaar kar rahe hai taaki raajnneeti ho
 If everyone is a Sirius then why does Asha Ranjan, the wife of journalist Rajdev Ranjan, have to go astray in Delhi
 chanda babu ke sawaalon kaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 His picture shocked everyone
 shahabuddin ko lekar gathbandhan daanv par he
 The question is who is at stake
 kiske liye lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Who has benefited from the politics of coming out of Shahabuddin? agar shahabuddin ke anusaar nitish kumaar paristhitiyon ke mukhyamantri hai to kya paristhitiyaan badal rahi hai
 Nitish Kumar has the answer only and only
 aap un par nazar rakhiye
 This is not the answer that they do not have time to pay attention to the useless things
 shahabuddin agar phaltu hote to jadyu ke netaa press conference kar lalu par gathbandhan dharm nibhaane kii zimmedaari na daalate
 We also understand so much politics
 aap to kair samajhate hi hai

 Somnath Bharti was the Law Minister in the 49-year-old Aam Aadmi Party's first government in 2014
 is dauraan somnath bharti ne khidki ekstansion ke kuch sthaneey logon kii shikaayat par aadhi raat ko police ke saath chhapemari kii thi
 The National Human Rights Commission had blamed Bharti for forcibly entering into the house and mistreating 12 women of African descent and fined them 25 thousand rupees
 haalanki aam aadmi party ne is maamle main purv kanoon mantri ko clin chit de di thi or hoicourt se bhi somnath ko doshi tehraae jane par roak laga di gai thi
 Now his troubles have increased after the Delhi Police was allowed to file a case against Somnath from the Lieutenant Governor
 gyaat ho ki pichley dinon somnath par unki patni ne bhi gharelu hinsa kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 This matter is still going on
 tippaniyan Somnath had raised a controversy last Monday, saying that if the police in the NCR came to the hands of the 'delhi Government', 'beautiful women wearing jewels' would be able to roam safely outside even at midnight
 somnath ke is kathith sexist coment par siyaasi dalon se saath unki patni lipika mitra bhi unke khilaaf kud padi hai
 CPI leader Brinda Karat has said that Somnath Bharti has been consistently making mistakes in terms of mentality about women, there is no level of such sexist statements
 somnath kii patni lipika ne kaha, 'main dekhne main ausat mahila hum
 Maybe that's why they treated me badly
 unhen meri suraksha kii koi phikr nahin he, unhen to sirf khubasurat mahilaon kii suraksha kii chintaa sata rahi he
 ' somnath bharti saal 2014 main aam aadmi party kii 49 din chali pehali sarkaar main kanoon mantri the
 Meanwhile, Somnath Bharti raided the police at midnight on the complaint of some locals of the window extension
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne bharti ko jabardasti ghar main ghuskar africa mul kii 12 mahilaon ke saath badsuluki karne kaa doshi tehraaya tha or unpar 25 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bhi laga diya tha
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party gave a clean chit to the former Law Minister in this case and Somnath was also convicted from the High Court
 ab dilli police ko uparajyapal se somnath ke khilaaf cese darj karne kii ijaajat ke baad unki museebataan bad gai hai
 It is to be known that Somnath was also accused of domestic violence by his wife in the past
 yah maamla bhi abhi chal hi rahaa he

 Somnath's alleged sexist comment from political parties along with his wife Lipika Mitra has also jumped against him
 sipiai netaa brunda karaat ne kaha he ki mahilaon ko lekar maansikta ke maamle main somnath bharti lagaataar galati karte rahe hai, aise sexist bayanon kaa koi str nahin he
 Somnath's wife Lipika said, 'I am an average woman to watch

 The Delhi Daredevils, who have kept their hopes alive in IPL 10 through timely innings of batsmen after their five successive matches, will come down to feather their hope against the Gujarat Lions here tomorrow
 duusari ore suresh raina kii aguwai vaali team agar magar kii kathin dagar main bane rahane kii koshish karegi
 The Daredevils have maintained their hopes of reaching the playoffs by defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad by 6 wickets in a thrilling match here last night
 uske ab nau maichon main chah ank hai lekin uski aage kii raah katai aasaan nahin he kyonki rahul dravid kii koching vaali team ko agar nokout main sthaan bananaa he to use apane baaki bache paanchon match jeetne honge
 The good thing for Delhi is that he has to play four of these matches at his home ground, Ferozeshah Kotla, and his batsmen, who have been performing poorly so far, are fulfilling their responsibilities at the right time
 dairedevills kaa team prabandhan haalanki yah baat acchhee tarah se samajhataa he ki ek match main bhi haar us par baari pad jaaegi or isliye vah kisi bhi tarah kii dhilaai se bachanaa chahega
 Talking about Gujarat Lions, its biggest problem is not the expected performance of the batsmen
 iske kaaran uski team ne ab tak das maichon main saat match ganvaae hai or uske keval chah ank hai
 It seems highly unlikely for the Lions to reach the playoffs but if Magar's arithmetic remains his blurred prospects and his team will surely be committed to keeping these hopes up
 isse pehle tak keval sanju samson ke pradarshan main hi nirantarata dekhne ko mili thi jinhone ab tak 313 ran banaae hai
 Except him, no other batsman from Delhi has reached 200 runs, so it can be guessed that if the Daredevils are struggling to reach the playoffs, then their batsmen have been largely responsible for this
 jahir chotil hone ke kaaran pichley do maichon main nahin khel paae
 The team missed his inspiring captaincy, experience and a keen bowler
 jahir kii anupasthiti main kaagiso rabada par daaromadar tha lekin sunrisers ke ballebaajon ke saamne unki ek nahin chali thi or vah chaar over main 59 ran lutaa gaye the
 This South African bowler will definitely be desperate to improve it
 tippaniyan Chris Morris has usually won the all-rounder's role, while Mohammed Shami has raised hopes with his precise bowling
 amit mishra ab bhi team ke mukhya spinner hai lekin vah ek jaisaa pradarshan karne main naakaam rahe hai
 Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem and off-spinner Jayant Yadav have so far only played four and two matches respectively in which they bowled economically
 gujarat liance kii pareshaani uske ballebaajon ko nirantar acha pradarshan nahin kar paanaa he
 The batting order of the team looks very strong in the presence of Brandon mccullum (318 runs), Suresh Raina (318 runs), Dinesh Karthik (221), Aaron Finch (199), Ishan Kishan (149) and Dwayne Smith (94) but They could not perform according to the needs of the team on most occasions
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) dilli ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki use inamen se chaar match apane gharelu maidan firozshah kotla par khilne hai or ab tak lachar pradarshan kar rahe uske ballebaaj sahi samay par apni jimmedaariyon par khare utarane lage hai
 However, the team management of the Daredevils, however, understands well that even in a match, the loss will be overshadowed by him and hence he would like to avoid any laxity
 gujarat liance kii baat karen to uski bhi sabase badi samasya ballebaajon kaa apekshit pradarshan nahin kar paanaa he
 Due to this, his team has lost seven matches in ten matches so far and has only six points
 liance ke liye plaof main pahunchnaa lagbhag naammumkin lag rahaa he lekin agar magar ke ankaganit main uski dhundhlee sambhaavnaaen bani hui hai or nishchit taur par uski team in ummiido ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye patibaddh hogi
 Earlier, only Sanju Samson's performance was seen as a continuation, which has so far scored 313 runs
 unako chhodkar dilli kaa koi bhi anya ballebaaj 200 ran tak nahin pahunch paaya he jisase andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki agar dairedevills ko plaof main pahunchane ke liye sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he to iske liye kaaphi had tak uske ballebaaj jimmedaar rahe hai
 Zaheer did not play in the last two matches due to injury
 team ko unki preranadai captaini, anubhav or ek manze hue gendbaaj kii kami khali
 In Zaheer's absence, Kagiso was on Rambada but he did not get a single in front of the Sunrisers batsmen and he was dismissed for 59 runs in four overs
 yah dakshin africa gendbaaj nishchit rup se isamen sudhaar karne ke liye betaab hoga
 The comments kris morris alrounder kii bhoomika main amuman khare utre hai jabaki mohammad shami apni sateek gendbaaji se ummiden jagaai hai
 Amit Mishra is still the main spinner of the team but he has failed to perform the same
 baayen haath ke spinner shahbaaj nadeem or of spinner jayant yadav ko ab tak kramash: chaar or do maichon main hi khilne kaa mauka mila he jinamein unhone kifayati gendbaaji kii
 The problem of Gujarat Lions is their batsmen are not able to perform consistently
 brandan maikulam (318 ran), suresh raina (318 ran), dinesh karthik (221), eron finch (199), ishan kishan (149) or dwen smith (94) kii maujuudagi main team kaa ballebaaji kram behad majboot dikh rahaa he lekin ye adhiktar maukon par team kii jaruraton ke hisaab se pradarshan nahin kar paae

 The Lord's ground, called the 'mecca' of cricket, is very special for every cricketer
 har cricketer kaa sapana is maidan par aakar badi pari khilne kaa hota he, vahiin team chaahati he ki is aitihaasik ground se use khitaabi jeet hasil kar use champion team ke rup main pahchaan mili
 Talking about the World Cup, this ground has been very special for many teams
 world cap ke 12wein sanskaran se england ke rup main cricket jagat ko chatha or lords ke maidan se teesraa world champion mila
 5 Final matches of the 12 World Cups have been played at the historic Lord's Cricket Ground so far and the most spectacular thing is that the team that became World Champion 3 times out of 5 managed to win the title for the first time
 iske alaava kolkata kaa eden gardens, melbern kaa emsiji or pakistan kaa gaddaphi stadium bhi ek-ek baar world champion team dene main kaamyaab rahaa
 World Cup cricket began in 1975 in the inaugural 3 World Cup Final Lords
 pehle sanskaran main westeindies or australia kii cricket team final main pahunchi, donon tiimon ke bich khitaabi jang aitihaasik lords par hi hui jisamen westeindies ne laajawab khel dikhaate hue pehla world champion banane kaa gaurav hasil kiya
 In 1979, the West Indies reached the final in the second World Cup, while the England team got into the title battle for the first time and lost in the match at Lord's
 1983 kaa world cap bhi england main hi khelaa gaya
 Putting a hat-trick like the last 2 times, the West Indies team reached the final and Team India was in front of them
 1975 ke baad 1983 se lagaataar 4 nae championlords par hi lagaataar teesri baar final muqabla khelaa gaya, or is baar saare kayaason ko jhuthalaate hue team india ke rup main ek nayaa world champion cricket kii duniya ko mila
 The opening 3 World Cups were played in England while the final was held at Lord's
 kapil dev kii aguwai main team india ke world champion banane ke baad 1987 kaa world cap bharat-pakistan kii mejabani main khelaa gaya or iske saath hi world cap kii mejabani kaa dayera england se nikalakar duusare desh (bharat) pahunchaa
 After arranging 2 World Cups (1992 and 1996), the opportunity to host the 1999 World Cup was won by England and the hosts of the final match at Lord's ground, but then the victory went to Australia's account which started the process of becoming World Champion in 1987
 Had finished kangaroo team record 5 baar world champion bani
 Now after 20 years, the World Cup again reached England
 sava maheene ke khel ke baad 14 july ko mejabaan england or newjiland ke bich lords par hi final muqabla khelaa gaya or yahaan se bhi ek nayaa world champion nikal kar saamne aayaa
 In this way, excluding 1979 and 1999 in the total of 5 World Cup finals played at Lord's, a new champion was found from the 1975, 1983 and now 2019 World Cups

 After India became the World Champion in 1983, the World Cup was played under the indo-pak host in 1987 with the final match being held at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata and from here Australia managed to become the champion team

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha he ki aam chunaav ke baad uttar pradesh ke nattejey hi is baat kaa faisla karenge ki centre main agali sarkaar kiski banegi
 He has also appealed to the people in his speech to vote keeping in mind the national issues
 manmohan singh ne pilibhit main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue yah baat kahi
 Singh targeted the BJP fiercely
 unhone kaha, 'logon ko rashtriya muddon ko dhyaan main rakhkar matdaan karnaa chahie
 The Prime Minister asked the people in question that whether there should be a government of such a party in the country which works to divide the society
 logon ko hameshaa hi satark hokar matdaan karnaa chahie taaki aisi shaktiyon ko badhaava na mili
 The Prime Minister said that the BJP is trying to divide the country through the manifesto
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ke shuruyaat ke din bijepi ne apana ghoshnaa patr jari kiya or isamen kaaphi badi-badi baaten kahi gai hai or kai chizon ko badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya he
 The Prime Minister said, 'the real issues are not being discussed in the country
 bina upi ke vikaas ke desh kaa vikaas sambhav nahin he
 Our government's work has been better than previous governments but our achievements are not being discussed
 hamaara record kaaphi acha rahaa he
 'he said,' We kept the country's economy in such a situation when there was twice the economic recession in the whole world
 vipareet paristhatiyon main bhi hamane acha kaam karke dikhaaya he or desh ke har tabake ko vikaas kii dhara se jodne kaa prayaas kiya he
 ' dilli police ne dilli vishvavidhyalay se ellem kii padhai kar rahe ek aise shaks ko giraftaar kiya he, jisane mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay kii farji website banaakar naukari dene ke naam par 5000 se zyada logon ko lakhon kaa chuunaa laga diya
 The Ministry had given a complaint in this matter
 27 saal kaa sumit kumaar dilli vishvavidhyalay se ellem kii padhai kar rahaa he, vah dilli vishvavidhyalay se hi elelbi or bikom kii shiksha puri chukaa he
 His wife is a gazetted officer in Delhi and father is an inspector
 lekin uskaa karnama sunakar aap bhi hairaan ho jaaenge
 The police have arrested him on charges of cheating
 police ke mutabik sumit ne mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay kii ek farji website banaai, jisamen mantralay kaa logo lagaaya or helpline number bhi daalaa
 On the website, he advertised recruits for 6,000 posts
 naukariyon ke liye aavedan karte vakt 400 rupee kaa shulk online jamaa karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 a bank account number was given in the advertisement for depositing the application fee
 dekhte hi dekhte mahaj 8 din main 5000 se zyada logon ne 20 lakh se zyada rupee jamaa kar die
 When the Ministry got this information, a case was registered at the Parliament Street police station
 police ne jab sumit kacount fries kara diyato vah karolbaag ke bank main isaki jaankaree lene pahunchaa
 The bank's employees immediately informed the police and the police arrested him from the bank itself
 police ke mutabik aaropee sumit ne ek trust bhi register kara rakhaa he
 This is the 11th of February
 centre for adivasee research and deveopment 'card' ne ramanika foundation ke sahyog se jab 'ramanika sammaan puraskaar' kii shuruyaat kii, to unhen yah bhaan nahin tha, ki ve itihaas rach rahe hai
 Ramanika Gupta was present full time at 36 Pt Ravi Shankar Shukla Lane despite Delhi's cold and disease
 unhone is kaarykram main adivasee bhashaaon main saahitiyik kaaryon or anuwaad ke liye jharkhand kii jyoti lakada ko sammanit karte hue is samudaay ke liye kiye gaye apane kaamon kii sankshipt charchaa kii
 But what Ramanika was, she wrote it herself in her autobiography 'aaphudari' in these words
 sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye is pustak kii bhoomikasch bolnaa kyon jaruri-main ramana hum, mere kai rup hai, jisase aap meri is katha yatra main rou-ba-rou hoiega
 i have also faced the brunt of being a bad girl, though i admit that i was not bad, but who am i to hear this judgment? Read no further! Will you tell me i was bad? Am i bad What i am, i want to hear from your mouth! Let's go with the autobiography! Yes, i am Ramna
 skool-college or praaanpatron main meraa naam 'ramanika' he jo 'ramnik' ko sangya kaa rup dene ke liye jaanboojhkar banaaya gaya he
 i love change even though i am still very much inside
 vahi ramana- kahin akeli khelti, kahin akeli daudti, kahin akele datati, kahin akele jhagadati or bisurti hui yaa bheed main juujhati hui, bahes karti, tark rakhti ek dubli-patali marial-si, sidhi-saadi, bhondu-si ladki! aise main abhi kya hum, ye kuch log jaanate hai, aap bhi jaan jaaenge
 At this stage, 'ramna' has brought me to this place, who used to laugh or smile even when she was stubborn, bad or bad or called a fool, but was adamant on her words
 nadi ko na pathar baandh sakate hai, na baandh
 The river does not stop until its water source is exhausted and i never let the source of my inner woman perish
 chunki main use nadi maanati hum, jisamen sab apni gandagi dhokar chale jate hai, par vah satat svachh abaadh gati se bahati rahati he
 Then how could my woman allow herself to become dirty by being bound by those stereotypes or restrictions, which i always rejected and broke
 main kitna nakaar pai, kaise nakaara, vah sahi tha yaa galat- ye aap bataaie
 When a girl is older, the girl's body is larger, not just her personality
 uske saath-saath uske sanskaar, granthiyaan, bhay or sankalp bhi bade hote hai or kabhi-kabhi ladki in sabase aage bad jaati he
 i ran to move or ran to run, i will tell these events, in which i kept happening or which i kept getting violated
 darasal har chiz paane ke liye ek hath jaruri hota he, ghoda bhi hath karata he or manushya bhi
 How much did i or my woman get, this is a question Perhaps the difference of time will give an answer - the woman's journey is still far! Faith is not eternal
 meri aasthaaen bhi badalin or ek din ve aasthaa na rahakar tark ban gayin
 It is only right to be argumentative
 uchit-anuchit kya he, maine isaki chintaa nahin kii, ye meraa kaam nahin
 i considered it more important to implement what the argument says, what i conclude, perhaps even correct
 tark ne mujhe amal karne kii raah dikhaai
 How far i have lived, it cannot be decided on the prescribed criteria since i had changed the criteria
 main safal hui yaa nahin, yah mere liye mahatvapurn nahin
 'I tried sincerely' was important to me
 kasautiyaan shaashvat nahin hotin, yahi meraa tark tha, yahi meri manyata thi
 i have a legacy of experiences which, along with me and my family, are the legacy of my era, my country and the world, whose conclusions are relative, not eternal
 aap apane-apane saapeksh dhundh sakate hai, rach sakate hai
 You can make new conclusions according to your own attitude and mindset
 iske liye aap aaazaad hai lekin yaad rakhie niyam, kanoon, daayre or samaaj, yahaan tak ki desh or duniya ke centre main manushya hi he
 Everything is for man only, for them man has neither been nor will be made
 isliye nishkarsh nikaalte samay yaad rahe ki aap pehle manushya hai
 Man's criterion is humanity, not the laws or laws of society
 unhen to manushya hi banaata he, manushya hi badalata he! main sadaiv aisa hi manushya banane ke prayaas main rahi
 i expected the same from my generation
 parivaar main prem-prasangon ke bahurange silsile kisi main bhi pyaar kii lalak paidaa kar dete he
 This love becomes more social rather than personal
 duusare ke pyaar ko barkaraar rakhane kaa prayaas, khud hi ek pyaar ban jaataa he
 The ardor of love is joined by the hunger for love of society
 is lalak ne aaj tak meraa peechha nahin choda
 This ardent slut has never been there, because there is no ardent slut attached to love, but society has been cursed to stand as a barrier to love
 yaheen shuru hota he pyaar or vyavastha kaa takaraav
 i supported love prem hota he, 'ho jaataa he' yojana bana kar kiya nahin jaataa
 This was probably the first episode in my family for a new generation
 meri usamen ruchi, parivaar kii prachlit parampara ke khilaaf 'vidroh' kaa samarthan tha
 On the other hand, the continuation of planned relationship was continuing, the same was valid
 manyataon or ichha ke sangharsh main maine ichha kaa saath diya
 My love sprouted in the fertile land of desire
 punjab ke hir-ranjha kii katha ko suna tha, apane ghar main use ghatate dekh kar main romanchit ho uthi thi
 How much this thrill and romance affected the life ahead was also imprisoned in the future
 jivan ke vartmaan main hi bhavishya kii neenv padati he
 The present in my subconscious was writing my future
 mere bheetar ghuti-ghuti apradhi-si meri icchhaaen adventure kathaon ko janm de rahi thim
 In my dreams, the stories of princes, knights, warriors, jinn and martyrs were born, died, climbed and martyred
 main abhinay or nrity ke jariye khud ko abhivyakt karne ko lalayit, vibhinn paatro ko apane nrity kii bhangimaaon main jeene lagi thi
 The hatred of that Khoost Arya Samaji master used to make the metaphor of a genie
 mere bheetar koi shahjada, rajkumaar yaa nite basataa tha, jo mere bheetar baithi ek dari-dari si ladki ko mukti dilaane ke liye sadaiv tatpar rahata tha
 The prince's voice echoed continuously in my ears
 pataa nahin kyon ek antarang saathi ban kar ek purush meri madad main aa jaataa tha, jabaki purush se hi trast thi main
 On one side was the 'I' of my difference and on the other side was my external 'I'
 meraa bahyarup vaachaal, hameshaa bahes karata, tark karata, hansataa, mazaaq karata, kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar
 He would not wait for a prince, nor a prince or a knight 'always ready to play the role of self-rescuer'
 mere antarman kii kamazori tha prem lekin jab lakshya kii prapti yaa patibaddhta kaa sawaal uthta to meraa bahirman prem ko bhi darkinar karne kii kuwwat rakhata
 It is my nature to take risks
 adventure kaa jazbaa keval romance hetu nahin, kisi uddeshy kii purti ke liye sadaiv hajir rahata he
 Like love, hatred is an essential emotion of human nature, which is born of insecurity and fear
 yah irshyaa or badale kii bhaavana se paravaan chadhataa he
 The development of civilization has taught society to hate
 usee ne varchasvvaadi banaaya he ise, yahaan tak ki is vikaas kram ne aurat ko bhi sampatti bana diya
 Property arises from possession and possession produces ego
 yahi aham, yahi darp duusare ko chota maanata he or khud ko bada
 Men climbed the stairs of development of civilization, became the head of society, became the creator
 vah ban gaya superman, jo kisi bhi kamazor se ghrinaa karata he, kisi bhi kamazor ko jinda rakhane ke paksh main nahin he
 Such a male-dominated society sowed the seeds of hatred and discrimination on the basis of gender, color and birth
 manushya paidaa hote hi ghrinaa nahin karata, prem jarur karata he
 Society only teaches him to hate
 maine behad prem kiya he
 There has been a lot of hatred, but hatred has not been able to dominate me for a long time
 isliye, haa isiilie shaayad main prem ko vyashti se samshti main badalane main kaamyaab rahi
 When love spreads to the group level, it becomes a giant
 uske saamne vyaktigat prem bouna ho jaataa he
 Faith itself becomes a necessary condition of greatness
 tark prashn karata he, prashn kaa uttar vishwaas ko janm detaa he
 The two have an interdependent relationship
 maine tark or vishwaas ko jiya he
 So whenever the trust was broken, i was shocked, i felt that my argument was defeated
 phir bhi maine na to tark choda, na vishwaas
 Both are needed to live
 vishwaas kho jane kaa arth he jeene kaa arth kho dena yani mrityu! tarkahin ho jane kaa arth he jivan jeena chhod dena arthath jivit laash ban janaa
 Logic creates trust by resolving doubts, then faith gives rise to hope
 maine ummid kabhi nahin chodi
 Therefore, after getting defeated again and again, she stood up
 yahi baar-baar uth janaa hi to vah utsaah he, ullas he, jo jeene kii ichha jagaata he
 It can also be said that the desire to live only keeps the urge to rise again after falling
 sach kehane kaa hausala bhi mujhe meri jeene kii ichha se hi mila
 i lived every moment maine yaadon se siikhaa he jinda rahanaa
 i have also lived memories uske liye jaruri he sach kehane kii himmat or kuwwat
 The harder the truth is, the bigger it is
 jitna bada sach hota he, utani lambi or prabhavakaari uski anugunj hoti he
 The more flat and clear the truth is, the bigger the secret is hidden within it
 vah jitna rahasyamay hota he, utana hi maarak hota he
 All the signs of change, all the juggling of shaking inertia, all the conditions of changing society, are hidden in the womb of truth
 maine satya kii isi rahasyamayi maarak or vidhvasank shakti kaa prayog kiya, apane khilaaf khadi saamaajik paramparaon, roodhiyon or tathakthith sanskaron kii baadh se ubarne ke liye
 Many attacks took place, many allegations were made, blasphemies were hurled
 maine unhen sweekaar nahin kiya or vaapis usee samaaj ko lautaa diya
 They all boomerang on them
 main agali muhim ke liye phir se uth khadi hoti rahi
 i had many deviations, but i raised myself from them
 aage badhane ke liye bhatkaav par roak lagaana jaruri hota he
 However deviation also does not go completely in vain
 vah bhi kuch-na-kuch sarthak chhod jaataa he
 The antelope of disorientation and the replenishment of repentance upon recovering from them also save them from getting lost in the missteps of life
 main apni galatiyon se isliye sikh pai, chunki maine unhen chipaaya nahin
 i put them in the bag of truth, which is filled with everlasting gifts of patience and tolerance
 lakshya kii talash main hi log bhatak jate hai
 They have the quickness to achieve everything quickly
 yah chatapataahat har achche-bure raste ko parakhane ke liye vichlit rahati he, isiilie phisal jaati he
 Even this slippery does not let a human go empty handed
 bure hi sahi, kuch anubhav lekar hi lautataa he manushya, jo sadaiv use khabardaar karte rahete hai
 The verdict can be wrong, if the intention is not wrong, then the verdict can also be changed
 dohare maapdand vaale saamanti samaaj main aparaadh-bodh se grasit khud ko apradhi maanati main, is stigma ko mitaane ko aatur main, apane gird mere jaise bedaag aparaadh-bodhiyon ke ghere se ghiri main, un gheron ko todane ke sankalp liya karti thi
 i knew that only those who called me a criminal made me a criminal
 in granthiyon se ubarna itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 These cracks which have been lying in personality since childhood are hardly removed
 zindagi bhar inkaa prabhaav bana rahata he
 These cracks, do not become trenches anywhere, so that i do not get lost in them, my good girl settled inside me struggled throughout my life
 main kitni kaamyaab houngi, yah samay ke antaraal main chipa tha par maine koshish nahin chodi
 My subconscious never considered me a criminal, not an infidel! i fell in love mujhase prem hua or maine prem kii hadein todakar prem kiya
 Love is not done, it is done
 maine khul kar jeena siikhaa
 Truth can eliminate duplicity, i know it
 isliye likhane baith gai main apane jivan kaa sach ki samaaj ke domuhepan ko ujagar kar sakuun
 With the intention of abolishing the double standards of human beings, which include both men and women, I, my woman, first started living on my own criteria
 aise maapdand kisi baadha ko sweekaar nahin karte
 i decided that i would not become anyone's tool
 praayah striyon ko hathiyaar yaa aujaar kii tarah purush upyog karata he
 My experience taught me don't be a tool
 praayah striyaan koi asuvidhajanak sthiti utpann hone par chup rah jaati hai
 It is better for them not to let such a situation arise
 baad ke dinon main mujhe yahi formula apnaanaa padaa
 i hated being exploited hard
 isliye uski gandh aate hi maine rishte tode hai
 The courage to break this gave me the courage to accept my truth
 sach bolne kii muhim, shaayad us yuva man ko raahat de sake, jo doraahe par khadaa nirnay lene se hichkichaata he, prem karnaa chahta he par darataa he samaaj se, khud apane se, chunki uske apane man main bhi samaaj ke maapdand haaavee hote hai
 The truth of girls is to bear first and then protest
 maine bhi is sach ko jiya
 The second truth that girls usually live in is the danger of abuses of Shuchita and the guilt that comes from it
 is shuchita yaa comarya ko bachaane kii phiraaq main hi aurat jivan bhar khud ko apradhi maanati rahati he
 The sense of purity was filled in my mind from childhood, whereas my purity was never safe
 virale hi koi stri hogi, jisaki shuchita samaaj ne surakshit rahane di ho, yah bhi ek satya he
 Eventually, his futility began to make sense to me
 samaaj kii nirarthakta siddh karne hetu mere liye yah tathy hi paryaapt tha
 i was aware of the futility of purity long ago, but i recovered much later from this book
 shuchita bhang hone kaa dansh, aparaadh ban kar jivan bhar kasakataa he or isi ke kaaran aurat janm-janmaantar tak aparaadhini, bevafa, vishwasghatini or chhinaal kehalaati he
 If the woman understands its futility beforehand, then perhaps she can avoid suffering from inferiority
 shuchita kaa tootna use apni hi nazar main giraata he jabaki purush apane pehle sahavaas ko mardaangi kaa sartificket ghoshit karke shekhi bagharta he
 Breaking this double standard, a woman can be free
 shuchita ke is pakhand ko todane kii pahal swayan stri ko hi kerani hogi
 In contrast to the code of conduct of our society, in western society, the purity of a woman is an obstacle in marriage
 ise uskaa gun nahin, uski anubhav-hinata samajha jaataa he
 This alleged Indian quality in him does not prove to be pleasant for household life
 mere aatmakathy kaa sach yah sabit karata he ki shuchita koi mudda hi nahin he
 It is a myth created for male supremacy, in which the number of impostors in the eyes of men and women falls in their eyes
 is maapdand se mukt hokar hi aurat ek swatantra aurat ban sakati he
 She can avoid the feeling of being unholy
 is hinata se ubarna hi use mukti de saktaa he
 It is true that a woman keeps asking for a story of guilt and fragrance around herself, but it is also true that only women who go on the journey of guilt can change society
 maine kaise usase nijaat pai, yah is aatmakatha kaa sach batayega
 It is a big truth that the law can be changed and changed only by breaking the law
 shuchita bhang hone ke baad maine yon-sambandhon kii gopneeyata ke niyam tode
 Secrecy is the biggest tool for women's subordination
 yon kii gopneeyata na sirf stri ke liye ghaatak he balki saamaajik vyavastha ke liye bhi khatarnaak he
 This gives rise to crimes
 na rishton main chhipav honge, na koi blackmel kar sakegaa
 The old values and the current values of the present, i and my generation used to face my test in my subconscious, i would participate in the creation of the bench of rebellion within me, new criterion, seeds of new values, of time
 Rugged in the rough field
 meri puri peedi hi lagi thi shaayad naye mulyon kii paudh kii ropai main, unke vikaas main lekin ateet khaad na ban kar, bhavishya ke kandhon par hi ladak gaya
 Till date society is carrying, feudal norms
 bhavishya ke bazaar main unhen bikaoo maal kii tarah prastut karne main vah koi kor-kasar nahin chhod rahaa
 These criteria of the feudal era are still being sold in the market
 suvidhaavaadi mulya tab bhi kaayam the, aaj bhi kaayam hai
 This generation challenging these values is also falling victim to those values
 main bhi kis had tak inkaa shikaar bani or inke khilaaf kitni had tak ladane main kaamyaab rahi, yah is aatmakatha kaa meraa sach batayega! maine apane or apni peedi ke sach ko aaj kii nazaron se bayaan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 How successful i am, this time will tell
 main yah jarur daawey ke saath kah sakati hum ki main haari nahin
 i have never given up because i understand that 'losing is not my destiny!' The destiny of a woman is not to lose herself, to fall and rise again, to struggle and move forward
 main multah ek kavi hum
 i started writing prose very late
 1978 main main bahut biimaar ho gayi thi
 i had two operations in Ranchi Hospital
 vahaan hazaribagh ke ek ubharate yuva kavi bharat yaayavar meri dekhbhaal ke liye aspataal main mere saath rah rahe the
 He had implemented the plan to organize Hazaribagh writers and organize seminars regularly at my house
 beemaari ke dinon main koyala khadaanon kii do mahila kaamgaar bhi mere paas meri dekhbhaal ko aa gayi thim
 The laborers used to come from the collieries everyday and take my news and collect the necessary expenses of the hospital
 unheen dinon bharat yaayavar ne teen mote registeron main meri diariyon se sabhi kavitaayen khoj-khojkar darj kar deen
 He only said that 'why don't you write on those for whom you are struggling so much? You will get so many stories about their life-struggle
 ' unheen kii prerana se maine ‘paravatiya’ kahani vahiin aspataal main hi likhi
 i have always considered Bharat Yayavar as my Guru
 ve hameshaa mere lekhan ko protsaahit hi nahin karte rahe, use disha bhi dete rahe
 Poetry was part of my life
 use jan main laane kaa kaam yaa patrikaon tak pahunchane kaa kaam shuru main bharat yaayavar ne hi kiya
 Then people started to know that i am not only political but also a poet
 meraa vidrohi swabhaav mujhe raajnneeti kii taraf le gaya tha, taaki main vyavastha ke khilaaf lard sakuun, use badal sakuun
 My heart was filled with compassion, towards creative programs and literature, that i should create something, i would make it
 kai sansthaaon ke nirmaan se maine samaaj ko kargar hastkshep karne ke liye taiyaar kiya, to sahitya ke madhyam se drushtikon badalane kaa abhyaas! darasal mere liye ye do raste nahin the, ek hi raste ke do chor the
 One is the starting point, the second is the end
 For a campaign, movement or a way, it is necessary to have both
 shuruyaat hi nahin hogi to lakshya par kaise pahonchega koi? meri ruchi, meraa swabhaav or meri prakruti bhi is raah par le jane kaa kaarak rahi he
 The only difference is that now politics has taken hold of literature and literature has taken political direction
 swaabhaavik he, bhatkaav kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin bachi thi
 This is the journey of my plans, which the struggle accelerated, and the accidents took two steps back and the inspiration and plan for the journey again! Struggles never let me get tired, taught me how to change the way! My experiences rode the tip of the pen, started landing on the pages! At first she used to write occasionally, when in mood, she would write only poems, which used to force me on during the struggles
 duusari baar dil kaa daura padane par mujhe bhay ho gaya tha ki shaayad main bachuungi nahin
 Without reciting my compositions, songs, i will leave without singing
 iskaa mujhe bada malaal ho rahaa tha
 i came to Delhi to have a heart operation done
 meraa dil ke aaparishan ke baad gol blader kaa aaparishan hona tha
 At the same time, i took Dr
 ramvilas sharma ji se milane kii thaanee, taaki apana rachana sansar unhen dikhaa kar unase disha le sakuun
 Taking time on the phone, i reached my home in Vikaspuri with my poetry books and diaries
 unhone meri katipay kavitaayen sunin bhi
 He asked, "what do you do?" i told them that i am struggling to get the rights of the workers of the coal mines and i am the General Secretary of the 'coalfield Labor Union' affiliated with CITU
 maine unhen kuju main mujh par hue intak ke kol maafiye ke hamale kii ghatana sunai or raligadha va kedla main hue sangharshon kii charchaa bhi kii
 He said, 'you write poetry, keep writing but you record your experiences in stories' Even if you write descriptive, it will be very important' It will be document, history, this era
 yah shodh ke liye kaccha maal bhi banegaa
 If not you or someone else will use them
 maine unhen kavita main likhi apni jeevani ke bare main bataaya
 He advised me to write stories based on my experiences and i started writing prose
 unase mil kar mujhe bahut santosh hua ki itane bade aalochak ne mujhe suna or disha di
 Dr
 ramvilas sharma ji se milane ke baad maine yojanabaddh tareeke se gadhy likhane kii thaan lee
 i decided that now i will write my experiences, the experiences of the workers, the reality of the farmers, the tragedy of the tribals, the pain of displacement, the search for the identity of the woman
 main likhuungi samaaj, satta or vyavastha main badlaav ke kisse, mukti kii drushti
 Now my poems started communicating as characters of fiction! My pen stood at the crossroads of thinking and thinking, started searching for direction of discussion
 mere shabd vigat 50 varshon ke ateet kaa itihaas gherne-baandhne ko vikal ho uthe
 Even today we are nervous, restless! i don't know how many texts i write everyday in my thinking! How many poems remain unmarked, lost in oblivion! i decided to write an autobiography
 main likhuungi aatmakatha
 i will write the truth without fail i will also accept my mistakes and hurt them
 itani lambi jindagi he meri
 Yes, i will record all my life
 maine aatmakatha ke saath–saath upanyaas bhi likhane shuru kar die
 With her inspiration, i wrote two novels 'sita' and 'mausi', which focus on the struggle of the tribal women of the jungle and coal mines
 phir apane sangharshon kii aatmakatha likhane baith gayi, jo ‘haadase’ ke rup main chhapi
 Harivansh ji, an abbreviated form of the accident, was serialized in 'prabhat Khabar' Patna in the name of 'agnidiksha'
 ‘mausi’ upanyaas ko satyaprakash ne banaras se ‘aaj’ main dharawahik chapa
 This story of 'aaphudari' is an assessment of events, clashes, conflicts and deviations in my life in the eyes of a woman
 ‘aapahudari’ meri aatmakatha kii duusari kadi he
 The first was 'accident'
 hazaribagh ke sangharshon ke baad hue sangharshon ko maine ‘haadase’ main darj kiya he, lekin stri drushti se mere nijee jivan kii takaraahaton kii jhaanki usamen nahin he
 At the time of the launch of the accident, Rajendra Yadav Ji had said that my autobiographies - 'vertical' are not running parallel
 ‘aapahudari’ main maine nijee jivan or sangharsh ke sach ko stri drushti kii kasuti par, aaj ke pariprerakshya main prastut karne kii koshish kii he
 The time of 'accident' was limited, the time of 'apahudari' is very long and space and geography are huge
 bachapan se lekar dhanbad tak kii yatra isamen darj he
 The third volume will be published later in the context of Hazaribagh's activities
 use likhnaa abhi baaki he
 The fourth section will discuss the extent of my experience and my experience among the litterateurs on coming to Delhi, and the story of the torture of the laborers and farmers who came to the house to de-class themselves due to being disconnected from the family
 mere yatra-sansmaran kii ek pustak, ‘laharon kii lay’ prakashit ho chuki he
 i have traveled to 21 countries
 is pustak main gyaarah deshon ke yatra sansmaran hai
 i also went to Hawaii after publishing the book
 uskaa vivaran patrikaon main to chapa he par pustak rup main aana baaki he
 Dinesh ji, Suman and Shikha have worked very hard with me in preparing 'aaphudari'
 unki main abhaari hum
 It is not enough to say thank you or thank you for the support that Bharat Bhardwaj, Abhishek Kashyap, Sadhana Aggarwal, Abhay Kumar Dubey and Ibbar Rabbi have given in improving the autobiography and above all thanks Mr
 Mahesh Bhardwaj, Managing Director Of publication, who not only prepared this book with great care, but also patiently waited for the book to be prepared
 unke baar-baar israar se bhi yah katha apana vartmaan rup le pai

 srilanka ke khilaaf ravivaar se shuru ho rahi vanade siries main viraat kohli ek baar phir se apana jalawaa bikherne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Team India played the last bilateral ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2012 under the captaincy of MS Dhoni
 jisamen kohli ne do shatakon kii madad se siries main 296 ran banaae the
 Team India won 4–1 in this series
 jaahir he ki viraat kohli us karname ko dohraane ke liye betaab honge
 However, this time Kohli would like to name three big records of which he is very close
 koun se hai wo record aaie ek najar daalate hai
 Virat Kohli, who is ranked second in terms of making the most ODI centuries, has so far recorded 28 centuries in 189 odis and he is third with Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya in terms of making the most ODI centuries
 donon ke naam 28-28 shatak hai
 Given the form in which Virat Kohli is playing, he does not find it difficult to score at least 3 centuries in five matches against Sri Lanka
 agar kohli siries main 3 or shatak laga lete hai, to vah riki ponting ke 30 vanade shatakon ke record ko tod denge or vanade cricket main sarvaadhik shatak lagane ke maamle main number 2 par pahunch jaaenge
 At number one is Sachin Tendulkar with 49 centuries
 100 vanade chakke puure karne kii kagaar par viraat kohliviraat kohli ke naam vanade main 91 chakke ho gaye hai or unhen apane 100 chakke puure karne ke liye 9 or chhakkon kii jarurat he
 It is obvious that he would like to achieve this record in this series
 kohli agar vanade main apane 100 chakke puure kar lete hai to vah yah karnama karne vaale duniya ke 32wein or bharat ke aathven ballebaaj ban jaaenge
 Suresh Raina (120) Rohit Sharma (124) Virender Sehwag (136) Yuvraj Singh (155) Sourav Ganguly (190) Sachin Tendulkar (195) MS Dhoni (208) 800 fours in odis Virat Kohli, Virat Kohli has 766 fours in odis
 unhen vanade main apane 800 chauke puure karne ke liye 34 chaukon kii or darkaar he
 Since, the series is of 5 matches
 aise main kohli ne agar do yaa teen maichon main badi paariyaan khel di to vah is record ko mukammal kar lenge or vanade main 800 chauke jadne vaale duniya ke 20wein khilaadi ban jaaenge
 India's record of highest fours in odis is in the name of Sachin Tendulkar

 They also do this to divert public attention from the internal problems of their country
 bijepi netaa ram madhav ne to yahaan tak likh diya ki bharat bacchon ke liye achche khilone banaata he
 The Congress too strongly criticized Bilawal Bhutto's statement and said that he is' daydreaming

 Former Chief Scientist of the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Gauhar Raza has called the Election Commission's claim as unscientific that it is impossible to tamper with the evms
 raja kaa kahana he, "duniya main aisi koi mashin nahin bani jise temper naa kiya ja sake
 From bicycles to spacecraft and calculators to evms
 haa temper karne ke naam alag-alag jarur hai
 If tampered with lawfully, it is called an operation and if it is done illegally, it is called a taper
 mashin ko thode hi maaloom he ki chhedchhad vaid rup se ho rahi he yaa ki avaidh rup se
 "gauhar Raza, a graduate from Delhi IIT and other highly educated students, says," When the world's scientists are remotely controlling the aircraft that reached the moon and Mars while sitting on Earth, there is no claim to our machine Can not be tapped
 takneekee taur par to tempring sambhav he
 But let the Election Commission hand over evms for this
 uchit aujaar muhaiyaa karaaye or saath hi software or hardware kii jaankaree bhi daavedaar ko de
 Also give proper time and then see if the machine is tempered or not
 varanaa to daawa nahin bakawaas he
 "raza believes that there is no claim even in who will taper 16 lakh machines and how
 unka kahana he, "sachai ye he ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko agar wo chaahe to chunaav jeetne ke liye sabhi mashiinon ke saath chhedchhad karne kii naa to jarurat he naa hi majaburi
 Only ten percent evms where the party has been at number two, elections can be won easily by tapping the machines there
 rahi baat takneekee paksh kii to aise main jahaan mashine ban rahi hai vahaan isamen aasaani se badlaav kiya ja saktaa he
 Because the software is coming from where the desired programming can be done
 "unka kahana he, "sabase pehlechunaav ayogko apana swabhaav or ravaiya badalanaa chahie
 The Commission feels that every person who raises a finger on the safety of evms is an enemy of democracy
 sunani sabaki chahie
 It is necessary to get satisfactory answers to everyone's questions

 In the meantime, he was expected to interact with the Congress at times
 lekin philhal is aawaaj-e-punjab manch ne kahin na kahin raajnneetik panditon ko hairaan jarur kar diya he

 aise main is morche kaa elaan pargat singh, bains bandhuon or siddhu ke liye badi safalataa kii guarantee banakar ubhar saktaa he
 These big names may also be involved

 kayaas ye bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki baagi 'aap' saansadon harindra singh khalsa or dharmaveer gandhi, jagamit singh baraada, vir davindra singh sahit anya or baagi netaa bhi isamen shaamil ho sakate hai
 What is written is that in the picture on the Facebook page of Pargat Singh in the poster of the front, it is written that awaaz-e-punjab should be tested, tested and met every test
 tasviir main likhaa he, 'aas or vishwaas kii raajnneeti ke liye ham ek hai
 Our war is against the forces which ruined Punjab
 ' haalanki, navjot singh siddhu kii ore se nai party banane ke bare main adhikarik pushti kaa abhi intjaar he
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party is torn apart
 aise menvirohi dhadaais manch se khaasaa khush najar aa rahaa he
 The Congress and the Akali Dal are currently taking a nip on this front, but all the political parties that are inside know that if the wave of this front is somewhere, the political future of many big leaders will be at stake

 Its music producer Meghdeep Bose explains what is the new arrangement, new element and new sound in it
 gane kii sichuation yah he ki dhoni apana exam dekar bhaagate hue cricket practice ke liye jate hai
 Meghdeep explains, "the music composer Amal Malik told me that the basic thing in this song is the railway station
 or vahaan sabase pehle kya dhyaan dete hai ton ton ton yatrigan
 Please pay attention to the announcement
 yahi is gane kii khaasiyat he
 If you see this film, you will definitely see the railway station in the song intro
 '' 27 varshiya meghdip kehete hai ki dhun ke peeche aap jo magic feel kar rahe hai vah mujic produsar kaa kaam he
 When the song is started, the song's intro comes and the magic producer who produces that time produces a music producer
 bakaul meghdip, "mujic produsar kisi bhi geet kii dhun ko kapade pahanaataa he
 Body is my tune and shirt is my production music
 gane main dhun ke saath main kya lapetata hum vah myne rakhata he
 So the arranger and music producer should not be called behind the scene

 According to him, the music producer's work is holistic
 bich main mujic synthetic hone laga tha
 He says, "this thing was tickling me
 isliye main organic mujic par kaam kar rahaa hum
 According to him, what was it in the '90s that was in Rahman Saheb
 vah tha production
 Rahman is a great programmer, arranger, sound designer
 unke gaanon main sound kaa element bada myne rakhata he
 He has taken elements of the instrument, such as the wind that comes out while playing the bass
 meghdip kaa maananaa he ki burman sahab aaj hote to ve next level par experiment kar rahe hote
 Meghdeep explains that music composer and music producer are entitled to equality in making a music
 lekin jab yah aam logon ke bich pahunchataa he to uskaa credit compoger ko diya jaataa he
 He says that music producers should also get credit
 iske liye ve sangharsh kar rahe hai
 Meghadip said, "I can't see my work being ignored
 haalanki, mujhe kuch sangeetkaar credit dene lage hai
 "they also say that the culture that has not yet come in our industry is in America, royalty is also available there
" meghdip bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani hai
 He is also a music producer, arranger, vocal arranger and singer
 sangeet unhen viraasat main mila he
 His father Dilip Bose got the job of music composer at the Catholic Missionary Center
 unhone boul mujic or tagore mujic se prerit hokar carch mujic banaaya or aaj bhi jitne hindi bhashi carch hai, vahaan unka mujic bajataa he
 It was this music that laid the foundation for the music of Meghdeep

 Rahman himself produces music which makes people feel his music

 ve bataate hai, "kai compojaron ko sirf dhun bananaa aata he, jaise anu malik or jatin-lalit
 Jatin Lalit was blown away
 usamen unka mujic kyon change ho gaya kyonki saleem-suleman ne mujic produs kiya tha
 All the songs of Adnan Sami were produced by salim-suleman
 sound kaise change hua mujic produsar kii vajah se
 "music is the life of Meghdeep
" ve har tarah ke instrument ko seekhney kii koshish karte hai
 At the age of 18, he used to come to Mumbai to learn piano because he did not have a classical music teacher in Bhopal
 unhone guitar or tabalaa ke alaava rabindra sangeet bhi siikhaa he
 His dream in the music world could not be fulfilled in the same way that Rahman was left unfinished, that is, he could not study music at Boston's Berkeley College of Music
 meghdip ke parivaar kii aarthik sthiti acchhee nahin thi jisase ve vahaan kii 40 lakh rupye kii fees jamaa nahin kar sakate the
 As a fan, when he met Rahman and told this thing, Rahman was encouraging and said that no matter what, work hard here
 or rahamaan ke sangeet se prabhavit meghdip 2013 main apana sangeet dene ke liye mumbai chale aae
 He got the support of composer Raju Singh and started working as an arranger in his team
 teen saal tak unke saath rahe
 Meanwhile, he continued to work for other composers as well
 ve kehete hai, "mere andar sangeet seekhney kii pyaas thi isliye alag-alag mastaron ke paas jane laga
 i knew that the more musicians i work with, the more my growth will be as a musician
 '' compoger amaal malik kaa dhyaan unki ore gaya, jab amaal yashraj studio main landan ke ek compoger ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Amal told him that he also wanted a similar music
 bakaul meghdip, "amaal ke saath meraa pehla gaanaa aayaa main hum hero tera (april 2015 main)
 He gave me credit as a music producer
 meraa kariyar chaalu hua
 According to Meghdeep, the credit for recognizing the music producer in Bollywood goes to Vishal Bhardwaj

 Amethi's political soil in Uttar Pradesh is such that it recognizes only one seed
 isliye chunaav ke mausam main jab gandhi parivaar kaa beej daal diya jaataa he to aasapaas vipakshi dalon kii sari fasalein nasht ho jaati or congress kii fasal kaati jaati he
 Members of the Gandhi family have been winning by record votes and reaching Parliament
 desh main modi kii lahar jitani bhi najar aae, lekin yah lahar amethi seemaa par aakar khatm ho jaati he
 The Gandhi family has strong roots here, only when the BJP, riding on the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was left out of lotus feeding
 haalanki, rahul gandhi ke saamne bijepi ne smriti irani or AAP ne kumaar vishwaas ko maidan main utaara tha, lekin congress ko maat nahin de sake
 However, for the last five years, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been conducting the memory of the BJP Irani in Amethi for the last five years
 2014 kii nattijeyrahul gandhi amethi se lagaataar teesri baar saansad hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Rahul Gandhi received 408,651 votes
 jabaki bijepi kii ummidavaar smriti irani ko 300,74 vot mili the
 Thus the margin of victory was reduced to 1,07,000 votes
 jabaki 2009 main congress adhyaksh kii jeet kaa antar 3,50,000 se bhi zyada kaa rahaa tha
 There is not a single MLA of Congress from Amethi, Amethi Lok Sabha seat comes under five assembly seats
 inamen amethi jile kii tiloi, jagadishpur, amethi or gauriganj siten shaamil hai
 While Salon in Rae Bareli district is the assembly seat
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 5 siton main se 4 siton par bijepi or mahaj ek seat par espi ko jeet mili thi
 Although the sp-congress entered the electoral arena by alliance, it could not win
 sapa ne to gauriganj seat jeet lee, lekin congress ko ek bhi seat nahin mili
 Durg Amethi parliamentary seat of Congress is called the fort of Congress
 is seat par abhi tak 16 loksabhaa chunaav or 2 upachunaav hue hai
 Of these, the Congress has won 16 times
 vahiin, 1977 main lokdal or 1998 main bijepi ko jeet mili he
 While the BSP and SP have not been able to open their account yet
 amethi kaa jaateey samikargamethi loksabhaa seat par dalit or muslim matadaata kingmekar kii bhoomika main hai
 The Muslim voters in this seat are around 4 lakh and about three and a half lakh voters are Dalits
 inamen paasi samudaay ke voter kaaphi achche hai
 Apart from this, Yadavs, Rajputs and Brahmins are also very well in this seat
 amethi sansadeey seat kaa itihashazadee ke baar pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav hue to amethi sansadeey seat vajood main hi nahin thi
 Previously this area used to be in Sultanpur South Lok Sabha seat and Balakrishna Vishwanath Keshkar of Congress won from here
 iske baad 1957 main musafirkhaana seat astitv main ai, jo philhal amethi jile kii tehsil he
 Keshakar was also successful in winning from here
 1962 ke loksabhaa chunaav main raja rannjay singh congress ke tikat par saansad bane
 Rananjay Singh was the father of current Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh
 amethi loksabhaa seat 1967 main parisemen ke baad vajood main ai
 Vidyadhar Vajpayee of Congress became the first MP from Amethi
 iske 1971 main bhi unhone jeet hasil kii, lekin 1977 main congress ne sanjay singh ko pratyaashee banaaya, lekin vah jeet nahin sake
 After this, in 1980, Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay Gandhi entered the electoral fray and thus transformed this seat into a Gandhi family seat
 haalanki 1980 main hi unka vimaan durghatana main nidhan ho gaya
 Subsequently, Indira Gandhi's elder son Rajiv Gandhi was elected as an MP from Amethi in the by-election held in 1981
 saal 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue chunaav main rajeev gandhi ek baar phir utre to unke saamne sanjay gandhi kii patni menka gandhi nirdaleey chunaav ladiin lekin unhen mahaj 50 hajaar hi vot mil sake
 While Rajiv Gandhi won by 3 lakh votes

 darasal 1997 main upi sarkaar ne ek niyam banaaya jiske tahat sabhi purv mukhyamantriyon ko sarkari awaas aavantit karne kaa praavdhaan laayaa gaya
 The government argued that the former chief minister serves the public, so they are given this facility
 suraksha ke lihaaj se bhi sarkari awaas dena jaruri he
 The comments lekin, supreme court main daakhil yachika main ek gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan ne kaha ki samvidhan main iskaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Even under up's own law, there is no provision to house former chief ministers
 ye aadesh radd nahin kiya gaya to baaki rajya bhi aise aadesh jari kar sakate hai
 After hearing the Supreme Court ruled that they should vacate the government bungalow in two months

 Also, as long as these people stayed in the bungalow, they should also pay reasonable rent for that time

 patrakarita or patrakaron ke bare main aksar charchaa hoti rahati he
 Today, this discussion is more common
 aaj mahatma gandhi kaa janmdin he or aaj ham aapako mahatma gandhi ke jivan judi ek aisi ghatana ke bare main bataa rahe hai jisamen unhone patrakaron khaskar reports ko apane saath le jane se manaa kar diya tha
 The Mahatma himself has written about this incident in his autobiography, 'the Uses of Truth'
 gandhi bihar main champaran kii yatra par the
 He wanted to meet farmers to listen and understand the problems of indigo farmers there
 gandhi ke champaran main hone kii vajah se vahaan ke sthaneey angrej adhikari chidhe hue the
 He wanted to send Gandhi back from Champaran by any means
 gandhi ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa he ki jab wo kamishnar se mili the unhone lagbhag dhamkaate hue champaran chhodane ke liye kaha
 Gandhi was later sued on the initiative of the commissioner, who later withdrew on the orders of the Collector
 inhen ghatnakramon ke bich gandhi ek is baat kii bhi charchaa karte hai ki unhen akhabaaron main roj chhapane vaali khabaron or charchaaon kii koi vishesh jarurat nahin thi
 He feared that the news published in newspapers would harm him and poor farmers
 gandhi tab sthaneey akhbaar ke sampadakon ko ek patr likhakar kaha tha ki aap apane samvaadadaata mere saath na bhejein
 If i find anything urgent, i will send you from there
 is bare main mahatma gandhi likhte hai, 'mujhe apni jaanch ke liye sarkari tatasthta kii jarurat to thi lekin samachar patron kii charchaa or unke samvaadadaataaon kii aavashyaktaa na thi
 Not only this, there was a fear of loss from more needles and longer reports of investigation
 isliye maine khaas akhabaaron ke sampadakon se prarthana kii thi ki ve reportron ko bhejne kaa kharch na uthaaen; jitna chhapane kii jarurat hogi utana main swayan bhejtaa rahoonga or unhen khabar detaa rahoonga
 'gandhi writes further in this sequence,' i used to think that Champaran's nymphs are very irritated
 main yah bhi samajhataa tha ki adhikari bhi man main khush na honge
 They will be more irritated by the printing of true and false news in newspapers
 unki is chidh kaa prabhaav mujhapar to kuch nahin padegaa, par garib, darpok raiyat par pade bina na rahegaa

 Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS
 vaaki ajeeb he aatank kaa ye aaka
 In recent times, the most intriguing puzzle about someone's death has been figured out, that's it
 isaki zindagi agar chhalaava he to maut ek paheli
 For one and a half years it had kept silence of death
 ab dedh saal baad achaanak phir se bol uthaa he
 It is reported that after the boria-bed was tied to Iraq and Syria, now ISIS and its leader Africa have reached Africa
 darasal, ek sawaal sabake jehan main aata he ki agarbaidadizindaa he to phir kahaan he? kya pichley dedh saal se 'beghar' he bagdadi? kya bagdadi ko chahie sir chupaane kii nai jagah? wo nai jagah kahin africa to nahin?ye bada sawaal isliye he kyonki dedh saal kii khamoshi or iesas kii barabaadi ke baad ek baar phir aayaa he bagdadi kaa audio
 In this audio, Baghdadi is appealing to his terrorists to unite and not give up
 lekin sawaal ye ki bagdadi ke is paigaam kaa matlab kya he
 Even if ISIS terrorists spread around the world accept Baghdadi, where will they be united? kyonki iraq or syria main to senaaon ne apana kabza waapas hasil kar liya he
 Then where did these terrorists from Baghdadi go? Is IS now building its base in an African country? It is reported that the Islamic State has begun to establish its roots in Somalia in recent days, after losing control of Syria and Iraq late last year
 vahaan aies ke hamale bhi bad gaye hai
 IS has claimed to have killed 14 people in the Lower Shabelle area of south Somalia recently
 janvari se july 2018 tak somalia main aies ke hamalon se jude aankade bataate hai ki is desh main aies kii gatividhiyaan bad rahi hai
 IS claims to have carried out several systematic attacks in Somalia
 kuch hamale jo din ke samay kiye gaye unhen filmaaya bhi gaya he
 Initially most of the attacks were claimed to be in the southwestern city of Afgoye
 lekin haal main azyaadaatar hamale rajdhani mogadishu ke aasapaas ke shaharon main ho rahe hai
 According to statistics, IS has carried out 39 attacks in Somalia from January to July this year
 inamen se 27 hamale sirf may, june or july main kiye gaye
 In 2017, the IS made 21 assaults in Somalia throughout the year
 iskaa matlab he ki somalia main aies ke hamalon main badhotaree ho rahi he
 IS carried out most of the ambush or shot killings, but improvised explosive devices (ieds) were also used in some
 aies ke nishane par kufia adhikari, somali police or sanyakarmi rahe
 However, despite increasing IS activities, their attacks in Somalia have been small for the time being
 somalia main aies kaa muqabla aatanki sanghathan al-shabaab ke saath he jo sena, sarkaar or africa senaaon par aksar bade or ghaatak hamale karata he
 And in fact al-shabaab's presence hinders the expansion of IS in Somalia
 somalia main aies ke hamalon kii jaankaree uski media wing amaaq de rahi he
 Most of Amaq's reports contain photographs or videos of the attack or the aftermath
 jinhen dekhakar lagata he ki inhen behad kareeb se filmaaya gaya he
 They have often been filmed with people in broad daylight and public areas
 iesasane ab tak somalia ko samarpit ek hi propeganda video banaaya
 Which was released in December 2017
 jisamen christmas or nae saal ke dauraan 'western target' ke kilaaf hamale ke liye uksaaya gaya tha
 IS has been claiming its presence in Somalia since late 2015
 isamen shaamil zyadatar log pratidwandvi al-shabaab se laae gaye hai
 Abdikadir Mumin has been described as the leader of IS extremists in Somalia
 mumin or uske kuch ladaake al-shabaab se aae hai or aktubar 2015 main wo aies ke mukhiya abu bakar al-bagdadi ke saath ek video main pratigya lete hue dikhaae gaye
 IS was at its peak then
 is saughandh ke baad aies kaa ek media campan bhi aayaa jisamen al-shabaab ke logon se aies main shaamil hone kii apil kii gai thi
 However, due to the dominance of al-shabaab, IS fighters have to chew gnaw to make their way into Somalia
 kyonki al-shabaab desh main aies charampanthiyon kaa khuleam safaaya kar rahaa he
 Even those members who wanted to join IS or had an inclination towards it
 haalanki america kaa maananaa he ki somalia ke aies ladaake yaman se hi hathiyaar lete hai

 ’(inputah bhashaa) The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament, on Wednesday passed the much-awaited Land Acquisition Bill
 rajyasabha main vidheyak ke kuch praavdhaan sanshodhit hone ke kaaran ise ek baar phir se loksabhaa se paarit karana hoga
 It would replace the 1894 Land Acquisition Act at the time of British rule, after the President's approval, after being passed by both the Houses
 'uchit muaavja or bhoomi adhigrahan, punarvaas evam punasrthaapan main paardarshita kaa adhikaar vidheyak, 2012' ko loksabhaa ne 29 agast ko hi manjuuri de di thi
 In the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, 131 members voted in favor of the bill and 10 members opposed
 ek sadsy ne matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 During the discussion in Rajya Sabha, members of different parties elaborated on various aspects of the law
 sadasyon ne vidheyak ke kuch mahatvapurn praavdhaanon ko lekar ashanka jaahir kii
 The BSP and SP termed it an election bill
 sarkaar kii taraf se sadasyon kii charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar vidheyak laae jane ke aaropon kaa khandan kiya or kaha ki yah do varsho se sansad main vichaaradhin he isliye ise chunavi manshaa ke tahat laayaa gaya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Ramesh responded to the objections and apprehensions raised by the members
 isse pehle charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue bhartiya janata party ke vinay katiyaar ne kaha ki yadi adhigruhit bhoomi kaa istemaal paanch varsh tak nahin kiya jaataa he to us sthiti main jameen bhoomi bank ke paas na jaakar kisaanon ko waapas milani chahie
 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati said that most of the people affected by land acquisition are small farmers and tribals and the government should think about their rehabilitation
 mayawati ne kaha ki vidheyak main kuch kamiyaan hai or sarkaar ko adivaasiyon or laghu kisaanon kaa vichaar lekar ek rashtriya sahmati banani chahie
 Responding to the discussion, Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh said that the Land Acquisition Bill is' an attempt to strike a balance between development and land acquisition and protect the rights of tribals who are displaced in the process
 ' mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki vidheyak main rajyon ke adhikaron kii bhi raksha kii gai he or urvar bhoomi ke adhigrahan ke bare main faisla lene kaa adhikaar rajyon par choda gaya he
 He also said that irrigation projects will not be brought under the purview of the Bill and the Special Economic Zone will be within its ambit
 notebandi kaa ek or said effect saamne aayaa he, transport kaarobaariyon ke mutabik notebandi ke baad lagbhag 90 fisadi kaarobaar thap ho gaya he
 The wheels of thousands of trucks carrying goods have come to a standstill, according to traders, the transport work is based on cash
 aise main notebandi kii vajah se trek driver se lekar transport company tak pareshaan hai
 Transport is a major part of the country's economy
 doodh-dahi, sabji, fal, anaaj sabakuch mandi se bazaar tak ek rajya se duusare rajya tak inhen trakon ke jariye laae-lejaae jate hai
 It is not only Delhi but also Asia's largest transport city
 lekin duvidha ye hai ki yahaan hajaaron trakon ke pahie tham gaye hai
 There is no Kamgurudaspur resident Lakhwinder Singh has been sitting vacant in Transport Nagar of Delhi for the last three days
 lakhvinder ke mutabik notebandi ke baad dukandaar se saamaan lekar kisi duusare shahar le jane main cash kii dikkat saamne aa rahi hai
 Neither new notes or open money are with the shopkeeper nor with the truck driver
 lihaaja trakon ke chakkar bhi aadhe ho gaye hai
 Lakhwinder Singh is not the only one whose truck is parked at Transport Nagar but there are thousands of trucks who have come to Delhi
 lekin ab dilli se duusare rajya jane ke liye naa to inhen koi kaam mil rahaa he or naa hi cash
 Ashok Saw, who reached Delhi from Kolkata, did not get any work for about 8 days after the 8 November demonetisation announcement
 jaise-taise saamaan lekar ashok dilli to aa gaye lekin ab chintaa he ki dilli se loding kaa kaam kab milegaa ?desh main 30 lakh trekajankaree ke mutabik desh main kareeb 1 karod commercial gaadiyaan chalati hai, inamen se 30 lakh trek ek se duusare shaharon ke bich maal kii dhulaai karte hai
 Shyam Sundar, vice-president of the United Federation of Transport Associations, said that before the ban of demonetisation, between 5 and 6 thousand trucks used to come everyday
 lekin ab ye sankhya 500 - 600 main badal gai he, trek sanchaalkon ke mutabik lambii duuri vaale trek kaa sanchaalan kar paanaa abhi mushkil he
 Actually, the driver has to pay cash for this, but due to demonetisation, this amount of cash is not possible, while other papers are also not able to give new notes, so the business is completely stalled

 agar aap share bazaar main sheyaron kii kharid-briki karte hai to aapke liye jaruri khabar he
 Actually, from April 1, the shares of listed companies can be transferred only in electronic form
 haalanki jin niveshkon ke paas physical form main share hai, ve ise rakh sakenge
 Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said, "there will be no restriction on the physical holding of the shares with the investors
" haalanki, agar koi niveshak physical rakhe sheyaron ko transfar karnaa chahta he to 1 april 2019 ke baad aisa sheyaron ke dimat rup main hone ke baad hi kiya ja sakegaa
 Explain that the decision to transfer the shares in mandatory demat or electronic form was done in March 2018
 sebi ne disambar 2018 main electronic share transfar kii samaysima badhaakar 1 april kar di thi
 Now SEBI has decided not to extend this deadline
 yani yah niyam 1 april 2019 se lagu hoga
 Sebi says that the purchase and sale of shares in demat form will make the record of shareholding of companies transparent
 iske alaava companiyon ke swaamitv ko lekar vivaad main kami aegi
 What is the physical form of shares? Before buying shares of a company, investors were given share certificates
 ise hi physical share kehete hai, yah prakriya online nahin hoti he
 But to convert physical shares into demat form, investors will have to open a demat account first
 dimat acount open karavaate vakt niveshak ko apni jaankariyaan deni hogi
 After opening the demat account, they have to fill the demat request form for every share
 iske baad unka physical share dimat acount main transfar honge

 upi main maheene bhar se chale aa rahe ganna kisaanon, chini mil maalikon or sarkaar ke bich vivaad ravivaar ko khatm hone ke asaar dikhaai diye
 The sugar mill owners have agreed to the minimum support price issued by the government and assured to start the mills at the earliest
 sarkaar ne kaha ki kisaanon ko apni fasal milon tak pahunchane or uski tay keemat milane main koi pareshaani na ho iske liye sthaneey prashasan or chini milon ke prabandhan ko nirdesh de diye gayi hai
 Finally, on Sunday, the sugar mill owners of UP succumbed to the opposition of sugarcane farmers and the hardening stance of the government
 mukhya sachiv kii ore se jari ek bayaan main bataaya gaya ki mil maalikon ne ganne kii kharid ko lekar 225 rupee ke rate kii jid chhod di he
 Now all the mill owners have agreed to buy sugarcane at the price of Rs 280 per quintal fixed by the government and start crushing in their mills
 magar iske liye chini mil maalikon ne tex main riyaayaton ke alaava ganne kaa paisa kisaanon ko do kishton main dene kii shart rakhi thi
 Which the government approved
 uttar pradesh ke mukhya sachiv javed osmani ne bataaya ki upi chini mil association ne patr likhakar pushti kii he ki perai tatkaal shuru kar di jaaegi
 The price of sugarcane will be payable according to the government fixed rate i
e
 Rs 280
 milon kii aarthik sthit or chini ke girte daamon ko dekhte hue mil maalikon ko kisaanon kaa paisa do hisson main dena tay hua he
 260 rupees when purchasing sugarcane for the first time and twenty rupees outstanding before the crushing season is over
 magar isse pehle upi main chini milen shuru karne ko lekar hai-tauba ravivaar ko bhi jari rahi
 On one hand, due to the state-wide Chakka jam of the National Lok Dal, the traffic stopped at the place, on the other hand, the sugarcane farmers led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union continued to sit outside the sugar mills of Western UP
 magar pradesh main raajnneeti kaa centre bane is mudde par samaajawaadee party sarkaar ko gherne main bijepi or congress bhi peeche nahin raheen
 It is evident that farmers have taken the biggest brunt of this month's delay
 jahaan ek ore pashchimi upi main kisaan virodh ke taur par apni ganne kii fasal sadakon par jalaai vahiin duusari ore purvi upi ke ek bade hisse main kisaan apni salbhar kii kamai kodiyon ke bhav bechney par majaboor rahe
 As the negotiations between the sugar mill owners and the government became inconclusive, many farmers who demanded a price of Rs 350 per quintal removed their sugarcane crop at Khandasari for less than a quarter of the price
 bichauliyon ne bhi iskaa phayda jam kar uthaaya
 Meanwhile, about a dozen farmers of Bankeganj town of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh have sent an affidavit to the President seeking permission for euthanasia
 pradesh kii chini milen na chalane se pradesh ke ganna kisaanon kii haalat dinon din bigadati ja rahi he
 Somewhere farmers are encircling the mills, somewhere suicides, and somewhere the farmers are forced to sell their sugar cane for 60 rupees quintals, then somewhere the farmers are demanding death due to their indebtedness in the debt and society
 lakhimpur khiri ke bankeganj kasbe ke rahane vaale bade kisaan prem bihari laal ne apane ek darjan saathiyon ke saath milakar raashtrapati ko shapath patr bhejkar ichha mrityu kii anumati kii maang kii he
 Small scale industries such as crusher and crusher operating in the district are buying sugarcane from farmers at throwaway prices
 kuch ganna kisaan to apana ganna 60-70 rupee main bechney ko majaboor he
 Former Minister of Delhi Government and MLA Kapil Mishra launched India Against Corruption Movement Part 2 at the Constitutional Club in Delhi
 kapil ne is maukey par india against karpshan or anna andolan se jude kai kaaryakartaaon ko aamantrit kiya
 Kapil started his speech by describing Kejriwal as a robber Khadag Singh and later announced that Kapil had carried out a surgical strike on Kejriwal
 kapil ne kahaaki kejariwal ko sargical strike ke saboot maangane kaa shauk he isliye saare saboot bhi die hai
 Kapil Mishra presented 7 proposals before the public which were passed with the consent of the public
 ab janata darbar main ye 7 prastaav arvind kejariwal ko dene kii baat kahi gai he
 These 7 Proposals passed - In order for our resolution of a corruption-free India, the people's movement for the continuation of the movement, India Against Corruption will continue in a continuous manner and will work to make governments accountable to the people by tightening the corruption
 2-jan lokapal kii maang ko lekar khadey hue is andolan se nikali aam aadmi party main party ke har str par nishpaksh aatanrik lokapal va lokayuktaon kii niyukti avilamb kii jaae
 3-the donations of Aam Aadmi Party should be immediately publicized on the website and the reasons for its removal in the past should be investigated
 4-dilli vidhansabha kaa khulaa satr ramlila maidan main bulaakar sarkaar par lag rahe ghotaalon par khuli bahes karai jaae va sarkaar in aaropon par shwet patr jari kare
 5-the people are the owners of the country, the people's representatives are responsible to the people, the right to recall is in the core spirit of our movement
 dilli sarkaar ke bhrashtachar ke saamne aane ke baad is sarkaar par vishwaas ke aankalan hetu pehla refrendom nai dilli vidhansabha main kiya jaae
 The tragic death of sister Santosh Koli, an early partner of the 6-movement, took place under extremely suspicious circumstances, even the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party called it a conspiracy and called it a murder
 arvind kejarivalane swayan bhi purna satta kii sarkaar aane par is ghatana kii sibiai jaanch karaane kii baat kahi
 The martyrdom of Santosh was used as an election
 unka parivaar aaj bhi nyaay paane kii ummid main lard rahaa he
 The assembly passes a resolution by the Delhi government to conduct a CBI inquiry into the causes and circumstances of Santosh Koli's death
 7-pehle rejigneshan phir investigeshan kii ladaai hamaare andolan kii pramukh maang he or arvind kejariwal or satyendra par itane aaropon ke baad unhen khud ke die gaye is mantra ke anusaar istipha den or khud par lage aaropon kii nishpaksh jaanch hetu sahyog karen
 The BJP has opposed the demand for increasing the salary of mlas in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne somvaar ko kaha ki 'janpratinidhitiv ek samarpan he, ek seva he or iske madhyam se milane vaale vetan evam bhatton par koi vyakti apana paariwarik jeevanyaapan nirbhar nahin rakh saktaa
 Tiwari alleged that there is a shortage of money for items like salaries of sweepers in Delhi but the Aam Aadmi Party is trying to increase the salaries of mlas
 tiwari ne kaha ki janpratinidhitiv ek simit kaal ke liye hota he or jaruri nahin ki janata 5 saal baad phir aapako chunegi hi yaa raajnneetik dal aapako 5 saal baad tikat degaa hi or isliye janpratinidhitiv ko ek sthai peshey kii tarah nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Also read: AAP and BJP together paralyze MCD: Mukesh Goelmanoj Tiwari has said that while mlas are already getting good salaries and allowances on the other hand, corporators giving more time to the public on the other hand Type of salary is not available
 bijepi ne aarope lagaaya ki tyaag or mitvyayita ke saath lokseva kaa sankalp logon ke saamne rakhkar satta main ai aam aadmi party kii sarkaar evam vidhayak jab se satta main aae hai tab se wo lagaataar apane vetan or bhatton main badhottaree ke liye koshish kar rahe hai jabaki duusari ore nagar nigamon ke karmchaariyon, khaastaur par safai karmchaariyon ke vetan bhatton ke liye aavashyak fund dena ho yaa phir dilli ke skulon ke liye shikshakon kii vyavastha, kisi bhi maamle main kejariwal sarkaar jaruri paisa nahin de rahi he
 Finally Manoj Tiwari said that 'there is a shortage of money for items like salary of sweepers in Delhi but the Aam Aadmi Party is trying to increase the salary of its mlas
 BJP government strongly condemns this
 ' The Congress is in the grip of Chhattisgarh government again and again in the state
 vah samaj hi nahin paa rahi ki aakhir rajya kii bijepi sarkaar karnaa kya chaahati he or vah kin muddon par use ghere
 Chief Minister Raman Singh's cabinet is repeatedly reversing its decisions
 ise prashasnic chook kahen yaa phir laaparvaahee yaa phir bijepi kii ranneeti kaa hissaa, lekin rajya sarkaar ke ek ke baad ek you-turn lene se congress bhram kii sthiti main aa gai he
 The BJP government withdraws its decisions as soon as the Congress sets the roadmap for the protests
 isse congress ko samaj hi nahin aa rahaa ki wo bijepi ke khilaaf pradarshan kahaan se shuru kare or kahaan khatm
 However, the U-turn of the state government is giving it new opportunities to attack the BJP
 chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav ke kareeb aate hi mukhyamantri raman singh or unki sarkaar ke you-turn se congress bharamaa gai he
 The confusion is such that the Congress does not understand where to start and end the agitation against BJP
 darasal mahinebhar ke bheetar chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaar ne cabinet se paarit apane hi faislon ko waapas lenaa shuru kar diya
 Due to these steps of the government, from the opposition parties to the BJP, the general public is also in control
 mukhyamantri raman singh kii cabinet mahatvapurn maamlo par jitani jaldi faisla le rahi he, utani jaldi apane faislon se palatate bhi ja rahi he
 The first case is related to the amendment of the Land Revenue Code regarding the land of the tribals
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne cabinet main prastaav laakar yah niyam paarit kiya ki ab adivaasiyon kii jameen vikaas kaaryon ke liye kharidi bikri kii ja sakegi
 The cabinet proposal was opposed across the state and ultimately the government had to withdraw its decision
 doosraa maamla,ski yojana se judaa he
 Under this scheme, the BJP government of the state announced to distribute smartphones for free to more than 55 lakh people at a cost of about one thousand crore rupees
 behatar connactivity ke liye raman singh cabinet ne prastaav paarit kiya ki mobile toweron kaa nirmaan panchayaton ke fund se kiya jayega
 For this, the cabinet got the approval of the amount of about eight to ten lakh rupees spent on the construction of mobile towers from the development fund of all gram panchayats in the state
 sarkaar ke is faisle kaa bijepi or congress shasit donon hi panchayaton ne virodh kiya
 After all, the government also reversed its decision
 teesraa maamla,rajya ke purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii jati se judaa he
 On the directions of the Supreme Court, the state government constituted a High Power Committee to investigate Jogi's caste, but a member committee called Jogi a fake tribal
 jogi ne hoicourt main is faisle ko chunauti di
 The High Court on technical grounds rejected the decision of the High Power Committee as illegal, and directed the BJP government of the state to set up the committee afresh
 teenon hi maamalon ko lekar bijepi sarkaar kii jamkar kirakiri hone ke baad faisle palatney se janata bhale hi pashopesh main ho, lekin mukhya vipakshi dal congress tilamilaai hui he kyonki uske virodh-pradarshan kii ruparekha hi nahin ban paa rahi he
 The government's U-turn from its own decisions indicates the failure of the government machinery
 kisi bhi masale par cabinet kaa faisla liya janaa ek mahatvapurn sarkari nirnay hota he
 The law which is also binding, but the speed with which the government is reversing its decisions, also raises questions on the credibility of the government
 rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh kaa maananaa he ki unke you-turn se koi fark nahin padane vaala
 If the work is better then they will come to power again for the fourth time
 philhal rajya main ek ke baad you-turn kii naubat aakhir kyon aa rahi he, yaa phir ye bijepi kii ranneeti kaa koi hissaa he ise lekar raajnneetik maahaul garmaya hua he

 desh ke pradhanmantri ke naam par faisla to loksabhaa chunaav ke baad hi ho sakegaa
 Akhilesh said that i have nothing to say on what Congress President Rahul Gandhi says about becoming Prime Minister
 darasal, karnataka main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki agar congress sabase badi party banati he, to vah pradhanmantri ban sakate hai

 masalan raashtrapati chunaav main kul 1 xxrep 4 0 1 vaid vot hai to vijeta ko 1,00,001 / 2 + 1= 50,000
 50 + 1 means at least 50,001 votes

 iske baad karnataka ke mukhyamantri tak kaa pad sambhala or ab hubli-dharwar central seat se bijepi ko jeet dilaane ke iraade se maidan main hai
 This seat is considered to be their traditional seat, having been an MLA 5 times

 He has also played the role of Leader of Opposition and Speaker in the Assembly

 This time it is considered very difficult for Shettar to be attached to the ground and calm in nature
 shettar rajya main yediuppa ke baad bijepi ke duusare sabase bade lingayat netaa hai
 There is resentment within the community for the BJP because of the Congress Kealingayat card and Shettar may have to suffer as a result
