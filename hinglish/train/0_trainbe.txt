 purv nyaayadhish tii jairam chauta or aar balasubrahmanyam ke do sadasyeey panel ne bisisiai kaaryakarini ko apni report saunp di jisaki ravivaar ko baithak hui
 With this the return of Srinivasan of Tamil Nadu is fixed
 is panel kaa gathan shrinivasana ke damaad or chennai superkings ke team principal gurunath mayppan, rajasthan royles or uske sah maalik raaj kundra kii bhoomika kii jaanch karne ke liye kiya gaya tha

 'srinivasan can take over the office of president only on August 2
 us din bisisiai kaaryakarini kii baithak bhi hogi
 Nothing was clear about Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan's role in the case
 pataa chalaa he ki jaanch ayog ne use clin chit nahin di he
 Shah did not respond when asked if Meiyappan had been given a clean chit
 sutron ke anusaar jaanch report main mayppan ko spot phixing main paak saaf qaraar diya gaya he lekin vah sattebaaji main lipt ho sakate hai iske koi spasht saboot nahin hai
 Dalmiya said that the report of the Commission of Inquiry was received only on Sunday morning and the rumor is not correct that it had got the BCCI earlier
 unhone kaha, ‘bisisiai sachiv sanjay patel ko report mili or use dopaher baad kaaryakarini main rakhaa gaya
 "dalmiya was asked who would preside over the meeting to be held on August 2," he said, "srinivasan will decide on it
 unhen apana faisla karne dijie
 He said that the report of Ravi Savani, head of the anti-corruption Unit of BCCI, was also discussed but one player Ajit Chandila is in police custody so the investigation could not be completed
 daalamia ne kaha, ‘ham kuch samay intjaar karenge or phir us hisaab se aage badhenge
 Savani is currently on leave due to his son's marriage
 unhen waapas aane dijie
 "rajiv Shukla has resigned from the post of Chairman of IPL Governing Council and in such a situation, on who will preside over the meeting, Dalmiya said," i have requested him to continue in the post
 maine shukla kaa istipha manjuur nahin kiya he
 Dalmiya said that the BCCI is in the process of finalizing the schedule of tours to South Africa and New Zealand
 unhone kaha, ‘yah prakriya main he
 There are two other seizures as well
 ham sahi samay par aapako suchit kar denge
 On the controversy over the alleged conflict of interest of Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Dalmiya said that nothing will be kept under pressure
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane kaam karne kaa apana tarika badal diya he
 Players must declare their interests in sports management companies
 ’ ipel spot phixing maamla tab saamne aayaa tha jab bhartiya tej gendbaaj es srisanth or rajasthan royles ke unke do saathiyon ajit chandila or ankit chavaan or 11 sattebaajon ke ipel main kathith spot phixing ke maamle main giraftaar kiya gaya
 The crisis escalated when on May 26, the Chennai team's Team Principal and Srinivasan's son-in-law Mayappan were arrested for betting
 isaki jaanch ke liye teen sadasyeey panel gathit kiya gaya tha jisamen do jajon ke alaava bisisiai ke tatkaaleen sachiv sanjay jagadale shaamil the
 Srinivasan refused to resign, but on June 2, he agreed not to discharge his functions until pending investigation
 unhone yah kadam jagadale or tatkaaleen koshadhyaksh ajay shirke ke tyaagptr ke baad uthaaya tha jinhone shrinivasana se naitik aadhaar par istipha maanga tha
 The World Cup has started and speculation is also at its peak
 semifinal ke chaar daavedaaron main shumaar team india ke naam par bhi charchaaon kaa bazaar garm he lekin master blaster sachin tendulkar kii maane to team india kaa rasta itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 According to Sachin, the match to be held in Adelaide on 15 February will be very close
 tendulkar ne kaha he ki us din donon hi timen apana best pradarshan karne utrengi aise main team india kaa rasta aasaan nahin hoga
 According to Sachin, if Pakistan's performance in warm-up matches is seen deeply, the danger bell is ringing for Team India, although Sachin has full confidence in Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his team and believes that Team India will never Also the tournament stance may change
 sachin ke mutabik upmahadweep kii tiimon par is baar bhi khaas najar rahegi
 Sri Lanka have been touring New Zealand for a long time, which will give them full advantage, players like Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan will prove dangerous in Australia and New Zealand conditions
 sachin ke mutabik australia, newjiland, england or dakshin africa ko paristhiyon kaa sabase zyada phayda milegaa kyonki jis tarah ke wicket par unki timen saare saal khelti hai, waisi hi paristhiyon main unhen world cap bhi khelnaa he
 However, according to Sachin, the most dangerous team in the tournament is South Africa
 bharat ke liye sachin kii salaah ye he ki khilaadi pehle match se hi apana puraa damakham jhonk de kyonki pehali jeet hi aatmavishvaas badhaane kaa kaam karegi
 According to Sachin, India's first match against Pakistan will be difficult, but the encounter in South Africa on February 22 in Melbourne is also very important
 bharat dakshin africa se ajtak worldcup main jeet nahin paaya he
 According to Sachin, this team has been taken very lightly till date, but this time South Africa is a strong contender for the title
 apni bhavishyavaanee ko lekar isse pehle pareshaani main funsane vaale australia ke diggaj leg spinner shen warn ne aaj phir se bhavishyavaanee kii jo kaaphi had tak sach bhi sabit hui
 The comments bharat or australia ke bich chauthe or antim test match main camentry kar rahe warn ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki australia duusari pari main 157 ran banayega
 Incidentally, Australia lost nine wickets for 157 runs and later the team was able to score 164 runs
 warn ne isse pehle vishwa cap 2011 ke dauraan bharat or england ke bich bengalooru main khele gaye match ke taai samaapt hone kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 The match actually missed the tie and then Warne's prediction was viewed with suspicion
 isisi ne bhi tab unki is bhavishyavaanee par gaur kiya tha
 Commenting on the fourth and final Test match between India and Australia, Warne predicted that Australia would score 157 runs in the second innings
 sanyog se australia ne nau wicket 157 ran par ganvaa die the or baad main team 164 ran hi bana pai
 Warne had earlier predicted a tie between India and England during the World Cup 2011 in Bengaluru
 yah match vastav main taai chuta or tab warn kii bhavishyavaanee ko andeh kii najar se dekha jane laga tha

 varsh 1877 main test cricket kii shuruyaat ke baad se iske niyamon main kai badlaav kiye gaye hai
 Test cricket is at another point of change
 27 november 2015 ko yah de-nite cricket main pravesh kar rahaa he
 With this, the tradition of using the pink ball in it will also begin
 pehali baar ek hi pich par lagaataar paanch dinon tak de nite cricket kheli jaaegi
 While the behavior of the pitch will be monitored on the one hand, on the other hand, pink ball remains the most discussed topic as it is being used for the first time and there is curiosity in the entire cricket world about its behavior
 vanade main safed to phir test main kyon nahin?vanade cricket main ek safed gend kaa prayog 25 overon ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 In this, new balls are used from both ends
 isaki peeche vajah he,safed gend kaa rang jaldi nahin kharaab hoor dudhia raushnee main ise aasaani se dekha ja sake
 At the same time, in Test cricket, the rule of changing the ball is only after the match of 80 consecutive overs
 vanade kii ek pari ke baad hi safed gend kaa rang bhura padane lagata he vahiin 80 overs tak to iskaa rang gaharaa bhura ho jayega
 There is a brown pitch
 yani ballebaajon hi nahin balki fielders ko bhi isse khaasi pareshaani hogi
 Along with this, even though the test is going on day night, the color of the cricketers' dress will remain white
 yani safed gend se is test ke khele jane kaa koi prashn hi nahin uthta
 How pink ball was selected? Like red color, there is a big problem with red ball
 paramparaagat test cricket laal gend se din kii raushnee main kheli jaati he
 But when this ball is seen in milky light, it looks brown
 jo pich kaa rang bhi he
 For this reason it was already rejected for day night cricket
 test cricket dekhne ke liye lagaataar darshakon kii sankhya main giravat ne is prayog ke liye exparts ko prerit kiya
 For this, the first choice was the selection of the ball
 emsisi ke export chaahate the ki gun or vyavhaar main donon gendon (laal or us gend jise de nite test ke liye chunaa jaae) main adhiktam samanta ho
 That is, there is no problem in seeing human eyes in milky light
 gahan adhyayan ke baad imperial college of landan ke export ne anya sabhi rangon par pink ko variyata di
 Experts also experimented on 15 different shades in pink
 antat jis pink rang kii gend kaa upyog is aitihaasik test main kiya janaa he use pasand kiya gaya
 How is pink different from the red ball of the test? Pink, red and white have maximum equality in all three balls
 in gendon kii oochaal, kadaapan or chamade main koi antar nahin he
 Yes, pink has a distinct difference other than colors
 darasal phinishing ke dauraanpink balpar rang kii ek or parat chadhaai jaati he
 Because of this, the color of the ball remains bright for some more intervals and remains in the state of play for a long time
 export ke liye ball ko color dena bahut kathin kaam nahin tha
 How will there be a balance between bat and ball? This was the biggest challenge for him
 unke liye yah jaananaa jaruri tha ki jab ball match main prayog kiya jayega iskaa vyavhaar kaisaa rahegaa? isaki oochaal kisi rahegi? prayog ke baad ball kii surat jab bigadegi to yah kaise bartaav karegi? pink ball ko antim rup dene main is sabhi pahaluon par gaur kiya gaya
 No lunch break during the test Another feature of this test will be that there will be no 40 minute lunch break
 haa isaki jagah dinar brake jarur milegaa
 This is the name given to Tea Break
 lekin yah brake pehle or duusare seshan ke bich main milegaa
 Experts hope that the way Carrie Packer started the tradition of playing one-day matches in 1970 in a milky light with white ball and colorful dress and one-day cricket changed
 usee prakaar test main bhi ye de nite kaa prayog ise adhik romaanchak bana degaa
 This time the rules of Test cricket have been given a pink color, keeping all other traditions intact
 ummid he ki is dauraan adhik se adhik darshak maidan main dikhenge
 So let's wait for the third session game when the floodlights will be turned on and see what the pink ball feeds

 One such picture is becoming viral on social media, in which it can be seen that after years a son suddenly sees his father as a prisoner, what happens to both of them
 ye tasviir kahaan kii he, betaa kin halaat main pita se mila, ye sab aap tak pahunchaayenge, lekin usase pehle aapako bataaen ki kuch arsa pehle soshal media par ahmedabad kii ek tasviir viral hui thi
 This picture was of the occasion when the children of a school were taken to an old age home
 skool kii ek bacchee vriddhashram main apni daadi ko dekhakar hairaan ho gai
 Grandma and granddaughter both started seeing each other and started crying
 skool ke baaki bachche bhi yah drishy dekhakar bhavuk ho gaye
 Actually, that girl did not know that her grandmother would also be in the old age home
 wo jab bhi ghar par daadi ke bare main puuchhati thi to use yahi bataaya jaataa tha ki daadi kisi rishtedaar ke ghar par gai hui hai
 Now let's return to the first photo which is being told of Thailand
 vahaan ek skool ke bacchon ko moral ajukational activity ke tahatjeldikhaane ke liye le jaaya gaya
 a schoolboy was stunned to see his father in prison as a prisoner
 beta naam ke is bachche ne beete 10 saal se pita kaa munh nahin dekha tha
 The child was not told at home that his father was in jail
 bachche se yahi kaha gaya tha ki uske pita laapata hai
 The child started crying after seeing the father
 pita-putr kii tasviir ko arom khunmong naamak shaks ne sabase pehle 05 sitambar ko apnefesbukpej par aplod kiya
 After seeing this, his post went viral
 arom khunmong kii ore se banjud raing naamak ek sanghathan chalaaya jaataa he
 This organization arranges educational and recreational tours for schools and companies
 arom ne apni fasebuk post main jail main pita-bete ke bhavuk milan kii ghatana ko vistaar se bataaya
 With the picture of father and son going viral on social media, thousands of responses started on Facebook, Twitter
 khojbin se pataa chalaa ki tasviir thailand ke reyong praant ke ek jail kii he jahaan "jam ryong skool" ke bacchon bacchon ko moral ajukeshan tour par le jaaya gaya tha
 Arom wrote in his Facebook post- 'to understand the moral values, when the children of class 10th to 12th entered the prison premises, there were many prisoners standing at the pre-determined places there
 saare bachche aage badhate gaye, lekin 10veen class kaa ek baccha vahiin kone main thithak gaya
 The child was staring at a prisoner
 mere liye ye ajeeb tha
 The prisoner was also crying seeing that child
 maine bachche se poocha ki kya hua to usne bataaya ki teacher, wo mere pita hai
 i was also shocked to hear this
 bachche ne pita se milane kii baat kahi to pita tak ye baat pahunchaai gai
 At first the father hesitated to meet the son
 pita ko dar tha ki bete ko skool ke sahpaathiyon main sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 After much persuasion, the father agreed to meet the son
 teachers ne jail prashasan se milane ke baad pita ko kaidiyon se alag bulawaaya
 Both father and son clinging to each other and started crying
 pita ne bete se poocha ki skool ke doston ko bhi pataa chal gaya hoga ki tumhaare pita kaidi hai
 Because of me you must also be feeling embarrassed
 is par bete kaa jawaab tha- 'nahin bilkul nahin
 i am more than happy to meet you
 'pita ne bete se vaada bhi kiya ki wo jail se nikalakar ek behatar insaan banenge
 At the same time, he advised the son to become a good person
 phir bete ne thai samskruti ke mutabik pita ke pairon par sir rakh kar vidaa lee
 Arom Khunmong also wrote in the post- 'after seeing this emotional union of son and father, i am deeply moved myself, so i am not writing about the crime and punishment of the father

 Earlier late Wednesday, a farmer named Bhinarmada Prasad gave his life in Hoshangabad

 khet kisaan congress adhyaksh sukadev muni kutraahe ne kaha ki kisaan ramesh kii maut kii vajah uskaa karj tha jiske liye use notice aa rahe the
 Due to which the distressed farmer Ramesh ate poison in the field today, due to which he died in the hospital

 Probably because of this he ate poisonous medicine

 He does not look for headlines, but studies the way he writes

 Another study, 'pious Teens, Social Media and Privacy Report', has also drawn a similar conclusion
 america ke pus focus group kaa kahana he ki ab bacchon ke mata-pita or ghar ke bade bhi fasebuk par sakriy ho gaye hai or yahi vajah he ki tinegers main isaki lokapriyata ghatati ja rahi he
 Apart from this, the growing drama between over-sharing and Facebook friends is also the reason for this

 Research also found that Teenagers has an average of 300 Facebook friends, while only 79 followers on Twitter

 According to him, 'people think that we try to look cool
 lekin ye kabhi meraa makasad nahin tha
 i am the least cool of all the people on Facebook
 ham lagbhag 10 saal puraane hai isliye ham pehle kii tarah nahin kool nahin or ab hamaare liye aisi chijen taiyaar bhi nahin kii jaatin
 Instead of making Facebook cool, Zuckerberg wants to make it a tool like electricity which people use every day

 Three days ago, the country's Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde was advising Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on a visit to Uttarakhand, but his tone was changed on Tuesday, due to Rahul's visit
 scindia bole ki ab halaat thik hai, isliye rahul ji daura kar rahe hai
 If you are confused about Shinde's moving tongue and changing statement, then listen to this incident
 ye pichley baras kii baat he
 a school program was going on in Pune
 aaj ke grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia vahaan chif guest kii haisiyat se maujuud the
 It was the turn of speech and the reference turned towards corruption, then Shinde said, people in India forget all
 boforce bhul gaye
 You will also forget the coal gate or the coal scam
 bayaan par bavaal machaa, to scindia bole ki program bahut syrius ho chalaa tha, isliye maine majaak main ye tippanee kii
 The incident may be the result of political anecdote
 magar ye sach he ki home ministar kii syrius post sambhaal rahe scindia is tarah ke majaak ab bhi lagaataar karte rahete hai
 Only then, within three days, his tongue began to lighten stuttering
 bayaan badal gaye or iske peeche kii besharmi chupaane ke liye sabhi netaaon ko dhanyavad karne kaa lihaaf bhi odha gaya
 Three days ago, when Narendra Modi arrived in Uttarakhand as part of his pre-announced program, according to protocol, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand first met Vijay Bahuguna
 rajya ke halaat par charchaa kii or sahaayta kii peshkash kii
 Significantly, this assistance was not just financial
 narendra modi ne kaha ki bhuj main bukamp aayaa tha
 The city was then relocated
 isamen ejiniyaron kii jo team lagi thi, vah yahaan aa sakati he
 This offer to Bahuguna was neither swallowed nor bled
 unhone shaleenta se bas itnaa hi kaha ki yahaan kaa ilaaka pahari he, halaat alag hai
 Will have to see
 iske baad modi ne ilaake kaa hawaii daura kiya
 Home Minister Shinde's directive had the effect that Modi was not allowed to go to relief camps
 us vakt desh ko mantri ji kaa tark thos laga tha
 After all, there is a hindrance in relief work from VIP visits
 us vakt scindia bole the ki uttarakhand ke alaava kisi bhi or rajya ke mukhyamantri ko vahaan nahin janaa chahie halaat dekhne ke liye
 Only the police and the army should be allowed to do relief work in a professional manner
 durust baat rahi
 Then the Congress gathered in the face
 modi ko prachaar kaa bhookha qaraar diya gaya
 Disaster tourism was cited by IB minister and Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari
 diggi to aise main hameshaa chaukas rahete hi hai
 He also said that feku at work again
 magar ye kya, teen din main hi scindia feku najar aane lage
 On Tuesday, he was asked the question that right now you were saying that no VIP will be allowed to land and Rahul Gandhi has been doing air and road tour of the state since Monday
 is par scindia ne jo jawaab diya, use unheen kii jubaan main sunen, padhein
 Shinde said, 'we did this because all the policemen are under the vip's arrangement because of the landing of VIP people below, so we requested
 main khud nahin ja paaya
 i was refused
 narendra modi bhi nahin gaye
 He also just overviewed from above
 nirikshan kiya
 Now Rahul ji has gone, because the situation is right now, the first three-four days were not good
 maine keval siem uttarakhand ko jane ke liye kiya tha
 Don't let anyone go, he said
 sab netaaon ne desh ke ise suna, main dhanyavad detaa hum
 This kind of work takes people
 bachaane kaa kaam hota he
 Everything is going well cordially
 ’is bayaan main koi kaat chhaant nahin kii gai
 Whatever you have told till date, presented before you
 magar gaur kariye isaki ibaarat par
 The home minister of the country, who is considered to be the most powerful after the PM in the order of power, is expressing helplessness
 kah rahaa he ki mujhe hi uttarakhand jane se manaa kar diya gaya
 And this Khanti leader of Solapur, was so straightforward that he agreed
 phir paristhit thik ho gai
 But the minister did not know
 chalata to wo daura karne pahunch jate
 But then Super PM Rahul Gandhi arrived
 aise main scindia kya safai dete
 So said that everything is fine now
 aisa hi sab thik manmohan ne bhi bataaya tha desh ko
 But how wrong it was, he came to know in 24 hours from the flood of reactions
 is sandarbh main congress kaa modi ke khilaaf aakraamak ravaiya or hamalavar rukh dhardaar nahin dikh rahaa
 Congress leaders are taking a dig at the CM of Gujarat
 koi unhen rambo kah rahaa he, to koi ravan or superman
 But notice that they are the same leaders who also say in the same breath that Modi is not a threat to the Congress
 agar khatra nahin to itani tavajjon kyon
 On the other hand, Modi has been pulled from another corner
 unke aane ke baad teen partiyon main simate endie ke ghatak dal shivasena ne nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Army supremo Uddhav Thackeray wrote in the party mouthpiece Saamana that how long Modi will remain the leader of Gujaratis only
 sawaal jaij he or modi ko vakt rahete iskaa jawaab khojna hoga
 They will also have to see that the legends about them are being refuted before they become a joke
 varna rambo modi or 15 hajaar ke aankade janashruti banane main der nahin lagaate

 dolphinon kaa lagaataar ho rahaa shikaar or ganga ke pradooshan ko iskaa kaaran mana ja rahaa he
 By the way, the government is now going to open Asia's first dolphin research center in Patna to save the dolphins
 varsh 2009 main centre sarkaar dwaara banaai gai 'bhartiya vanya jeev sangrakshan niti' ke tahat dolphinon ko suraksha pradaan karne ke prayaas ke baad bhi bihar main ganga nadi main is standhari praani kii suraksha ke liye koi khaas prayaas nahin kiye ja rahe hai
 Experts say that just as the tiger symbolizes the health of the forest, similarly the dolphins are a sign of the health of the Ganges river
 ganga main ghatate jalastr va uski gandagi par bhi paryaavaran vaigyanik samay-samay par chintaa prakat karte rahe hai
 As the water level decreases, the chances of hunting dolphins increases
 jaankaar bataate hai ki puure desh main dalphinon kii sankhya 1800 he jisamen keval bihar main 1200 dolphin hai
 According to the data, two-three years ago there were 200 dolphins in Patna from the Cow Ghats to the Klectriot Ghats, but now their number has come down from 25 to 30
 ullekhneey he ki inhen suraksha pradaan karne ke liye sarkaar ne varsh 1991 main bihar main sultanganj se lekar kahalgamv tak ke kareeb 60 kilometre kshetra ko 'gangetic river dolphin sangrakshit kshetra' ghoshit kiya he lekin iske baad bhi inke shikaar main kami nahin aa rahi he
 The Chairman of the Advisory Committee set up by the Central Government for Dolphin Conservation and Dr
 a k Sinha, Head of Department of Biology, Patna University, told IANS that a special type of oil is found in dolphins
 kisi bhi dolphin main yah tel uske vajan ke 30 pratishat ke baraabar hota he
 The smell of this oil attracts other fish
 machuaare apane jaal main isi tel kaa prayog karte hai or is tel ko paane ke liye ve dolphin kaa shikaar karte hai
 He says that there are less than 2000 dolphins in India now
 vah dolphinon kii kami kaa kaaran ganga kaa pradooshayukt hona bhi bataate hai
 He says that stopping the declining water level of the Ganges is a big challenge
 gauratlab he ki farvari 2012 main yojana ayog ke adhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia bihar daure par aae the
 When he set out on a trip to the Ganges, he had seen the dolphins' stuttering
 tabhi unhone yahaan dolphin shodh centre kholane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Sinha says that this center, built on the initiative of the Bihar government, will be Asia's first dolphin research center
 unhone kaha ki isse dolphin or uski kuch prajatiyon ko bachaane kii raah kholegaa
 Gangetic dolphins are one of four species found in clean water
 dolphin standhari jeev he jo citesia samooh kaa ek sadsy he
 Dolphin, also known as Sons and Sansu, is also known as 'ganga's cow' in common parlance
 jaankaar bataate hai ki ek purna vyask dolphin kii lambaai do se 2
 They weigh up to 70 meters while they weigh from 100 to 150 kg
 maadaa dolphin nar dolphin se apekshaakrit badi hoti he
 In the course of the development of dolphins, a very subtle 'eco location system' develops in them, like bats

 Facebook F8 is a two-day annual developer conference of social media website Facebook
 aakhri din company ne ek khaas tareeke kaa camera pesh kiya he
 Earlier also, the company introduced a virtual reality camera
 is baar ek nayaa video camera kaa elaan hua he jo khaastaur par 360 degree videos record karne ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Such videos are mostly made for virtual reality headsets
 fasebuk ke nae camera kaa shape ball kii tarah hajisamen 24 lens lage hai
 It also has a smaller version which will have 6 lenses
 isse pehle 2016 main develper conference ke dauraan hi fasebuk ne UFO jaisaa dikhne vaala camera launch kiya tha jo company kii pehali peshkash thi
 The last time Facebook kept its camera open source, that means its blue print was made free
 developers iske blue print se aisa camera bana sakate hai
 But this time the company is not preparing to free it, but can make the camera itself
 is camere main kya he khasis camera system ke jariye virtual experience jaise concert, muse ya kisi popular jagahon par ghoomane main chaar chand laga degaa
 If you are alone then it is for you or you are with someone
 iske liye aapako hedset kii jarurat hogi jo aapaki pojishan ko trek kar sake
 Is this camera for general users? It is not a common camera but a virtual reality camera and Facebook will not sell it directly to users
 maujuuda daur main virtual reality hedset kaa concept nayaa he or log VR Headset isliye bhi nahin kharidte ki unke paas isamen dekhne ke liye khaas content nahin hote hai
 In such a situation, if Facebook gives such cameras to film makers, then perhaps it will show interest in it and in the coming time, Facebook's earnings can increase
 ye nae camere record kiye gaye videos main extravijual eliments jode ja sakate hai
 The new camera shoots in 6 degrees, that is, you can move back and forth in a scene while watching videos recorded with it
 na sirf left rhite balki upar neeche bhi ja sakate hai
 This will help make the virtual world as real
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki use ummid he ki is saal ke aakhir tak parteners ke jariye yah uplabdh honge
 Although the company has not told how much it will cost, but it is obviously for the professional, then it will be an expense

 'padmavati' is not on historical facts: Bhansali 12: 02 AM Lucknow: From 8 am today, the counting of votes will be held amarnath yatriyon par yah hamalaa pichley kareeb do dashak main pehali baar hua he
 Earlier there was an attack in 2002 at Pahalgam passenger camp
 is hamale ke baad jammu–kashmir police or siarpief ne kaha he ki bas yatra jatthe kaa hissaa nahin thi or yatriyon ne niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 In the first reactions from traditional media to social media, there is also a sense of anger with grief and frustration
 hamale ke baad kuch logon ne soshal media par ise sampradayik rang dene kii koshish bhi kii he
 The truth is that this pilgrimage is as much for the holy Hindus as it is for the Kashmiri Muslims
 varsh 2002 main hue hamale ke agle saal 2003 main is reporter ne amarnath yatra ko cover kiya tha
 For every hotel, horse-mule and shopkeeper, this journey is the biggest source of earning in a year
 palki waalon se lekar apane peeth par yatriyon ko ladakar le jane vaale sabhi musalmaan hi hote hai
 Many of these people have no other means of earning
 "ham is yatra kaa puure saal intazaar karte hai
 
 
 These two months of the year, whatever we earn, is the whole year's earnings for us
 
 
 " ek khachchar vaale ne 2003 main mujhe bataaya tha
 At this time, the fear or anger in the Hindu community will arise from this journey, more disappointment for these people, for whom walking or not walking this journey is like a question of life and death
 tippaniyan Travelers do not just go to the holy cave of Amarnath
 inamen se bahut-se vaishno devi or ladakh bhi jate hai or patni top, gulmarg or kashmir ke nazaaron kaa mazaa bhi lete hai
 In Kashmir, it becomes time for pashmina shawl merchants, boat house owners, cashew-almonds and nut sellers
 yani yah sirf hindu tirth kaa nahin, balki puure kashmir kii arthvyavastha ko gulzaar karne kaa mauka he
 The religious aspect of the Amarnath Yatra is also associated with an interesting relationship with the Muslim community
 kareeb 14,000 foot kii oonchai par basii yah gupha or shivlinga kii khoj ek musalmaan charvaahe bootaa malik ne 19veen shatabdi main kii thi
 The priests may be Hindus, but even today the protectors of the cave are members of Malik's family, so this attack of terrorists is not an attack on a community but on the shared culture and economy of Kashmir
 sachai yah he ki yah yatra jitani pavitra hinduon ke liye he, utani hi mahatvapurn kashmiri musalamaanon ke liye bhi
 This reporter covered the Amarnath Yatra in 2003, the year following the 2002 attack
 har hotel vaale, ghode-khachchar vaale or dukaan lagane vaale ke liye yah yatra salbhar main kamai kaa sabase bada zariyaa he
 From the sedan to the passengers carrying all the passengers on their back are Muslims
 inamen se bahut saare logon ke paas kamai kaa koi or zariyaa nahin he
 "we look forward to this journey all year
 
 
 saal ke ye do maheene jo kuch ham kamaate hai, vahi hamaare liye puure saal kii kamai he
 
 
 "A mule guy told me in 2003
 is vakt hindu samudaay main jo dar yaa gussa is yatra se panpa hoga, usase kahin adhik niraashaa in logon ke liye he, jinke liye is yatra kaa chalanaa yaa na chalanaa jivan–maran ke sawaal jaisaa he
 The comments yatri sirf amarnath kii pavitra gupha hi nahin jate
 Many of these also visit Vaishno Devi and Ladakh and enjoy the views of Patni Top, Gulmarg and Kashmir
 kashmir main pashmina shawl vyapaariyon, boat house maaliko se lekar kaashew-baadaam or akhrot bechney waalon ke liye yah vakt kamai kaa ban jaataa he
 This means that it is not just a chance for the Hindu pilgrimage, but for the economy of the entire Kashmir
 amarnath yatra kaa dharmik pahalu bhi muslim samudaay ke saath ek dilachasp rishte se judaa he
 Situated at an altitude of about 14,000 feet, this cave and Shivalinga were discovered in the 19th century by Buta Malik, a Muslim shepherd
 pujari bhale hi hindu hon, lekin aaj bhi gupha ke sangrakshakon main malik ke parivaar ke log hai, isliye aatankiyon kaa yah hamalaa ek samudaay ke khilaaf nahin, balki kashmir kii saajha samskruti or arthvyavastha par hamalaa he

 Then the attackers blocked their way and shot them

 This sensational incident of murder is from Antu police station of Pratapgarh
 jahaan rasulpur gulraha gaanv main mangalvaar kii der shaam jila pradhan sangh ke adhyaksh dinesh dube kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that foreign payment companies like Visa, mastercard can process their transactions abroad, but they have to bring the data to India within 24 hours and store it here
 gauratlab he ki rigerv bank ne pichley saal april main apane nirdesh main kaha tha ki sabhi videshi pement companiyon ko apane data kaa 'keval bharat' main rakhana hoga taaki un par nirbaadh tareeke se nigaraanee rakhaa ja sake
 Now the Reserve Bank has given clarification on this
 news agency riters ke mutabik rigerv bank ke pichley nirdesh ke baad hi america sarkaar or companiyaan is niyam main badlaav ke liye jabardast lobying kar rahi thim
 He said that this directive would increase the cost of companies' infrastructure and hurt their investment plans
 videshi system se delit karnaa hoga databudhvaar ko rigerv bank ne kaha ki vah apane pehle ke rukh par kaayam he, lekin saath hi yah spasht kiya ki pement ke tranjaction ko desh se baahar process kiya ja saktaa he, lekin unke data ko desh main hi sangrahit rakhana hoga
 The Reserve Bank has also said that if a transaction is processed abroad, its data has to be brought to India within 24 hours and deleted from the system located abroad
 gauratlab he ki haal main vaanijya mantralay ne technology or pement companiyon ke saath baithak ke baad kaha tha ki unki chintaaon kaa samaadhaan rigerv bank karegaa
 The standoff between the Indian government and US companies in this case has increased the trade tension between the two countries
 bharat data storage ke liye kade niyam or data tak aasaan pahunch chahta he
 Apart from payment companies, India also wants to store data of all companies locally
 rigerv bank ne beete saal april main pement companiyon se local sarwar par apana data surakshit rakhane ke liye kaha tha, jiske anupaalan ke liye 6 maheene kii dedline bhi tay kii gai thi
 Despite the passage of this deadline, many foreign companies including Visa and mastercard have failed to do so
 videshi companiyaan aam taur par global sarvars par data store karti hai or sthaneey str par data store karne ke liye unhen atirikt nivesh karnaa hoga
 However, the government believes that storing data locally will help in monitoring and checking it if needed

 acchhee yaa buree jo bhi he
 You can't spoil it
 lekin lutiuns or khan market gang ne ek purv pradhanmantri kii chhavi 'mistar clin, mistar clin' kii banaai thi, vah kis tarah se khatm ho gai?' Surrounded by sharp opposition from the opposition on the issue of frequent seizing of the country's sailors by the Somali pirates, the government said that all efforts are being made to free the hijacked Indians, but will avoid doing anything that will prevent the Indian sailors Life is in danger videsh mantri es em krishna ne rajyasabha main kaha, ‘hamen is mudde par uddeshyparak najariya apnaane kii jarurat he
 We all get emotional when it comes to Indians, but we cannot get into an emotional impulse on this issue because our sailors are in danger

 We cannot endanger the lives of Indian sailors who are already at risk

 While the Spanish warship freed 'rake Africans' on which 11 Indian sailors were on board, there are still concerns about the safety of about 79 Indian nationals aboard another ship 'MV Suez'
 krishna ne kaha ki duutavaason se kaha gaya he ki ve sambandhit jahaajon ke maalikon par bhartiya navikon ko surakshit mukt karaane ke liye sabhi prayaas karne kaa dabaav daalen
 He said 11 Indian sailors aboard the 'rake African' ship were freed after 'negotiation of the agreement'
 11 bharatiyon kaa mukt hona hamaare liye acchhee khabar he
 On this, BJP member Venkaiah Naidu said that the government should also explain what this 'agreement' was and whether any ransom was given
 makapa sadsy seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kuch deshon ke bich sanyukt gasht dene ke liye bhi samjhauta hua or us disha main kya prayaas hue hai
 Krishna said, 'there are many things in the negotiation of the agreement

 On the other hand, Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakur and Jignesh Mevani, who have made their mark through reservation, prohibition, unemployment and Dalit oppression movement, are seen to be completely spoiling the political equations of the BJP
 patidaaron ke maseehaa bane hardik patelpatel aarakshan andolan ke jariehardik patelko pradesh hi nahin balki desh main nai pahchaan mili
 Hardik Patel changed the picture of Gujarat through the movement

 pichley dinon hardik ne bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf sankalp yatra nikaala tha or rahul gandhi ke saurashtra yatra ke dauraan swaagat bhi kiya
 Patidar's displeasure For BJP, the Patel community in Gujarat is about 20 per cent
 jo satta banane or bigaadane kii takat rakhata he
 Of the 182 assembly seats in the state, the Patel community has influence in 70 seats
 pichley do dashak se rajya kaa patel samudaay bijepi kaa paramparaagat voter rahaa he, jo philhal naaraaz mana ja rahaa he
 As a result, out of 11 Zilla Panchayat elections held in 2015, the Congress won 8 out of 11 Saurashtra and the BJP had to face defeat

 jignesh ne wo kaam kar dikhaaya, jisase dalit samaaj sadiyon se mukt hona chahta tha
 In the 'azadi Kooch Andolan', a dalit-muslim unity, Jignesh administered an oath to 20,000 Dalits not to raise dead animals and carry dirt
 jignesh kii aguwai vaale dalit andolan ne bahut hi shanti ke saath satta ko karaara jhatka diya
 This movement got the support of every class
 andolan main dalit muslim ekta kaa bejod najaara dekha gaya

 At present, the biggest theme is the Hindu Muslim theme
 isi theme ke bheetar saare prayog ho rahe hai
 Sometimes it is threatened, sometimes hate is sown and sometimes it is given good advice
 har kisi ke bas kii baat nahin he hindu muslim theme se azaad hona
 The politics of India has entrapped the public in this theme
 netaa bahut chaalaaki se kabhi-kabhi acchhee baat karne kaa dhong kar jate hai magar aap thodi chaturaai se samaj len to dikh jayega ki yah to vahi theme he jiskaa naam hindu muslim topic he

 Sohit wants you to see the audience how your young people prepare in a difficult situation and how the governments cheat with them
 aakhir sarkaar naukariyaan kyon nahin de rahi he, nahin deni he to saaf saaf kah de ki nahin denge magar form nikaalkar yogyata parikshaayen paas karakar kai-kai saal tak latakaane kaa kya tuk he
 Thanks to Sohit Mishra who came up with the essential story even a day before Holi, usually on this day, the reporters of the channels are searching for a singer who can sing on Holi, which can fill the TV space
 sohit ne khaali pet kii khaali aakankshon se is spes ko bharne ke liye mumbai se story bheji he
 Any state has a selection commission, it has made our youth cry
 unase sapane tod diye hai
 The cycle of examination is not completed for four years
 hamaari naukari series esayssi ke kaaran shuru hui thi
 From August to October 2017, the results of about 15,000 youngsters were reported
 merit list main naam aane ke baad chuppi pasar gai
 Nobody was telling when he would be appointed
 prakriya kab shuru hogi
 Troubled, the youth started calling but still no answer
 chaatro ne bataaya ki hamen niyukti patr nahin milegaa, kyonki 12 janvari ko ek aadesh niklaa he ki niyukti kii prakriya roak di jaae
 We could not believe it nor could we confirm it
 tabhi 29 janvari ko sanchaar mantralay se ek chitthee jari hoti he
 Its first line states that on 12 January the order of the Director of the Postal Department was that all circles should be stopped from the appointment of those who passed the SSC 2015 examination, till further orders
 chaatro kii 12 janvari vaale aadesh kii baat sahi thi
 In this order, it had come out that now the order has been issued that the process of appointment of 5205 youths of the Postal Department should be started
 jab ham yah series shuru kar rahe the tab sieji main jin chaatro kaa hua tha wo khub messej bhej rahe the
 Was calling tang kar diya tha
 He said that no one is talking to the CAG
 hamen kaaphi hairaani hui
 Vinod Rai is unable to speak, but the CAG can only speak after him
 pataa chalaa ki alag-alag padon ke kareeb 1700 naujavaanon kii naukari kaa sawaal vahaan atka padaa he
 During our series, the CAG had to speak for the first time that SSC has sent their dossiers
 isamen certificate, paas hone kaa pramaan patr vagairah hota he
 The result was arrived in August 2017, the dossier had not arrived for six months
 ye haal he esayssi kaa
 But after that again silence
 ham bich-bich main sieji kaa zikr karte rahe
 But on March 1, there is double good news
 kareeb 700 chaatro kii jwining kaa notification sieji kii site par aa gaya he
 The first news reported that 200 auditors have been allocated to the state CAG
 rajya mukhyalayon se ab niyukti patr milanaa shuru ho jayega
 By evening, another news came that 500 accountants have also been divided among the states
 rajyon ko inkaa dosier bheja ja rahaa, taaki niyukti patr jari ho sake
 The comments is series ke dauraan sieji ke chayaraman ne apni website par ek notification jari kiya, jisamen meri taraf ishaara kiya gaya ki ek channel buree niyat se yah sab kaam kar rahaa he
 My intention was not bad, i was sure that this series would go on until they get the letter
 esayssi ke chairman asheem khurana ji ne ek or patr website par daalaa ki inaki niyukti main esayssi kii koi bhoomika nahin he, enditivi ke ankar ko is sthiti kii jaankaree nahin he
 Now it is written in all the orders that SSC has sent the dossiers of the students, the process of recruitment is starting
 8 se 9 hazaar chaatro kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 You can ask those young people about this series
 uske pehle kitne hataash the, ab kitni aashaaon or umangon se bhare hai
 They have blossomed like the colors of Holi
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki hamaari naukari series ke baad chayan ayog sudharenge
 If it happens next year, we will do it for twenty days next year as long as i keep anchoring till then
 bahut se chaatr ab dar rahe hai
 Got the job
 main samajhataa hum
 Stay honest in your job
 sochie main bhi dar gaya hota yaa ek hi din yah report kar aage bad gaya hota to intazaar kii yah raat kitni lambii ho gai hoti
 Do not be afraid
 gandhi ji ne aazaadee kisi se darane ke liye nahin dilaai thi
 We do not celebrate the birthday of freedom heroes because they will be scared of anyone
 bank par aaj kuch nahin magar bankeron se yahi kahuunga ki agar unhen lagata he ki unase ghulaami karai ja rahi he to ve kisi ko holi ke sandesh na bhejein, na holi khele
 When there is no color, what is the color to pretend in life? aapke banker vaaki gulam kii zindagi ji rahe hai varanaa ve ek ankar ko phone kar foot-foot kar nahin rote
 You talk to them
 unhen gulaami se nikaaliye
 Bring out their suffering
 philhal hindu muslim theme hi sabase badi theme he
 All experiments are being done within this theme
 kabhi dhamkee di jaati he, kabhi nafrat boi jaati he to kabhi nek salaah di jaati he
 It is not a question of everyone to be free from the Hindu Muslim theme
 bharat kii raajnneeti ne janata ko is theme main fansaa diya he
 Leaders cleverly sometimes pretend to be good, but if you understand a bit cleverly, then it will be seen that this is the same theme which is named Hindu Muslim Topic
 hamaari raajnneeti ke paas aapke rojgaar bhavishya ke liye koi thos idia nahin he
 Therefore, there is a search for an idea that can confuse you in the debate
 aapako khuraaq de sake ki wo aapako mil rahaa he
 In the meantime, some youths have been addicted to opium, so they are asking about the question of their jobs, but listen to the answer that is being received
 aapane jinhen suna ve jharkhand ke bokaro ke bhaajapa vidhayak biranchi narayan hai
 The MLA ji joined hands that he did not have a job
 chunaavon ke dauraan mumbai se thagon kaa ek giroh aata he
 One who writes slogan for you with money
 palaayan nahin hoga, ghar-ghar rojgaar hoga
 After the election, the gang escapes first with the money to write the slogan
 rah jaati he janata or chunaav jeet kar vidhayak
 Biranchi Narayan ji liked a quality that he did not leave the anger of the youth, but kept speaking in the midst of them
 unke saath bane rahe
 This is a good quality of leader
 magar noujvaan kya kah rahe the
 The way of questioning the youth was also very good
 ek baar bhi apane vidhayak kaa apmaan nahin kiya, balki apane sawaal par tike rahe
 This led to a dialogue relationship between the legislator and the public
 naujavaanon jharkhand sarkaar kii ek niti kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The Jharkhand government has divided the state into two
 11 zile kii naukari main shesh bharat ke logon ko bhi hissaa milegaa
 There will be 13 districts where the jobs will be reserved for the people there
 ek hi rajya main do sthaneey nitiyon ke khilaaf chaatro andolit ho rahe hai
 Recently 20,000 students took out a rally in several districts
 11 march ko inkaa phir se andolan hone vaala he
 Our job series is ongoing
 holi se ek din pehle ek noujvaan kaa massej aayaa he ki use apointment letters mil gaya he
 The SSC (CPO) examination continued for the year 2016 and finally came out on 31 January 2017
 uske teen maheene baad medical jaanch hui
 The final result comes in September 2017, but nothing of joining is known
 kaaran ek ladke ne cese kar diya
 Joining 4350 youth stopped
 disambar 2017 main adaalat se aadesh bhi aa gaya
 The joining which was to be held in 2017 will now take place in April 2018, because in the letter which came on 1 March 2018, it is written that you have to join on 23 April
 SSC (CPO) kii pariksha ardhsainik bal or dilli police main sab inspector kii hoti he
 Happy Happiness on the day of Holi to 4000 people
 21 wein ank main hamane joda tha ki 7000 se adhik naujavaanon ko kader milane, jwining letters milane, jwining se pehle kii prakriya puri hone ke patr aane lage hai, aa chuke hai or aaenge
 Now you add 4350 to it
 is series ke dauraan jin naukariyon ke liye niyukti pakriya shuru hui he ab uski sankhya 11000 se adhik pahunch rahi he
 Perhaps this is the reason for the excitement that punishment for Propaganda has been confronting the questions of your life by staying away from the news
 is dauraan hamane hazaron chaatro ke messej padhe, unki baaten suni
 It was a tremendous experience
 badi sankhya main chaatro ne kaha ki ve kabhi hindu muslim dibet nahin karenge na iskaa hissaa honge
 Some students have told that the students told that many youngsters are still waiting for the appointment letter, having passed the SCC CGL 2016 exam
 ctrolar general of dephence acount main 3125 naukariyaan honi hai
 They have passed the examination
 jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra also visited these students a day before Holi
 din bhar unke saath bhatakate rahe
 Kept talking 15-16 ghante kii ye chaatr taiyaari karte hai
 They keep an eye on each news about when the recruitment came, what is the authority of the chairman, why the examination is delayed
 sohit chaahate hai ki aap darshak dekhen ki aapke noujvaan kis mushkil sthiti main rahakar taiyaari karte hai or inke saath sarkarein kis tarah se dhokhaa karti hai
 After all, why the government is not providing jobs, if it is not to be given, then it will be clear that we will not give it, but what is the reason for hanging the qualification examinations by hanging out for many years
 sohit mishra kaa dhanyavad jo holi ke ek din pehle bhi zaruri story lekar aa gaye, aamtaur par is din channelon ke reporter kisi gayak ko khoj rahe hote hai jo holi par ga de, jise lekar tivi kaa spes bharaa ja sake
 Sohit has sent a story from Mumbai to fill this space with empty aspirations of an empty stomach
 kisi bhi rajya kaa chayan ayog ho, isane hamaare naujavaanon ko rula diya he
 Dreams have been broken from them
 chaar-chaar saal tak pariksha kaa chakra puraa nahin hota he
 Our job series started due to SSC
 agast se lekar aktubar 2017 tak kareeb 15000 naujavaanon ke riselt aa gaye the
 Silence broke out after being named in the merit list
 koi bataa nahin rahaa tha ki unki niyukti kab hogi
 When will the process begin? pareshaan hokar noujvaan phone karne lage phir bhi koi jawaab nahin
 Students told that we will not get the appointment letter, because on 12 January an order has come out that the appointment process should be stopped
 hamen yakeen nahin hua or na hi ham isaki pushti kar sake
 Then on 29 January a letter from the Ministry of Communications is issued
 isaki pehali line main likhaa he ki 12 janvari ko postal vibhaag ke nideshak kaa aadesh tha ki sabhi cirkilon ko esayssi 2015 kii pariksha paas karne waalon kii niyukti roak di jaae, agle aadesh tak ke liye
 The January 12 order of the students was correct
 isi aadesh main niklaa tha ki ab aadesh yah jari hua he ki postal vibhaag ke 5205 naujavaanon kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kar di jaae
 When we were starting this series, the students who had been at the CAG were sending a lot of messages
 phone kar rahe the
 Was bullied
 unhone bataaya ki sieji se koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 We were very surprised
 vinod raay bol nahin paa rahe hai, magar unke baad sieji to bol hi sakati he
 It was found that the question of the employment of about 1700 youth of different posts is stuck there
 hamaari series ke dauran sieji ko pehali baar bolnaa padaa ki esayssi ne inke dogier bhej die hai
 It contains certificate, certificate of passing, etc
 agast 2017 main rigelt aa gaya tha, chah maheene tak dogier nahin pahunchaa tha
 This is the condition of SSC
 magar uske baad se phir khamoshi
 We kept mentioning the CAG in between
 magar 1 march ko dabl khushkhabari ai he
 The notification of joining about 700 students has come on the site of CAG
 pehle khabar ai kii 200 auditor ko rajya sieji kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 Appointment letters will now start being received from state headquarters
 shaam hote-hote duusari khabar aa gai ki 500 accountint kaa bhi rajyon kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya he
 Their dossier is being sent to the states, so that the appointment letter can be issued
 tippaniyan During this series, the chairman of the CAG issued a notification on his website, pointing out to me that one channel is doing all this with bad intentions
 meri niyat buree nahin thi, meraa iraadaa pakkaa tha ki jab tak inhen letters nahin milegaa yah series chalati jaaegi
 SSC Chairman Ashim Khurana ji put another letter on the website that SSC has no role in his appointment, the NDTV anchor is not aware of this situation
 ab saare aadesh main yahi likhaa aata he ki esayssi ne chaatro ke dogier bhej die hai, niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho rahi he
 The process of recruitment of 8 to 9 thousand students has started
 aap khud un naujavaanon se is series ke bare main puch sakate hai
 How desperate he was before, now he is filled with hopes and expectations
 ve holi ke rangon kii tarah khil uthe hai
 It is to be hoped that the selection commission will improve after our job series
 agar agle saal aisa hua to ham agle saal bhi ise bees din karenge basharte tab tak main ankaring karata rahaa to
 Many students are now afraid
 naukari mil gai he
 i understand naukari main jaakar eemaandaar bane rahiega
 Think i would have been scared or would have gone ahead after reporting it on one day, then how long the night would have been
 darana nahin he
 Gandhiji did not give freedom to fear anyone
 ham azaadi ke nayakon kaa janmdin isliye nahin manaate ki kisi se dar jaaenge
 Nothing on the bank today, but will tell the bankers that if they feel that they are being enslaved, then they should not send Holi messages to anyone or play Holi
 jab rang hi nahin he jivan main rang kaa kya dhong karnaa
 Your bankers are indeed living the life of a slave, otherwise they do not cry bitterly by calling an anchor
 aap unase baat kiijie
 Take them out of slavery
 unki pidaa ko baahar laaiye
 In the meantime, some youths have been addicted to opium, so they are asking about the question of their jobs, but listen to the answer that is being received

 Nothing on the bank today, but will tell the bankers that if they feel that they are being enslaved, then they should not send Holi messages to anyone or play Holi

 Your bankers are indeed living the life of a slave, otherwise they do not cry bitterly by calling an anchor

 The SSC (CPO) examination continued for the year 2016 and finally came out on 31 January 2017
 uske teen maheene baad medical jaanch hui
 The final result comes in September 2017, but nothing of joining is known
 kaaran ek ladke ne cese kar diya
 Joining 4350 youth stopped
 disambar 2017 main adaalat se aadesh bhi aa gaya
 The joining which was to be held in 2017 will now take place in April 2018, because in the letter which came on 1 March 2018, it is written that you have to join on 23 April
 SSC (CPO) kii pariksha ardhsainik bal or dilli police main sab inspector kii hoti he
 Happy Happiness on the day of Holi to 4000 people

 Now you add 4350 to it
 is series ke dauraan jin naukariyon ke liye niyukti pakriya shuru hui he ab uski sankhya 11000 se adhik pahunch rahi he
 Perhaps this is the reason for the excitement that punishment for Propaganda has been confronting the questions of your life by staying away from the news

 It was a tremendous experience
 badi sankhya main chaatro ne kaha ki ve kabhi hindu muslim dibet nahin karenge na iskaa hissaa honge

 Our colleague Sohit Mishra also visited these students a day before Holi
 din bhar unke saath bhatakate rahe
 Kept talking 15-16 ghante kii ye chaatr taiyaari karte hai
 They keep an eye on each news about when the recruitment came, what is the authority of the chairman, why the examination is delayed
 sohit chaahate hai ki aap darshak dekhen ki aapke noujvaan kis mushkil sthiti main rahakar taiyaari karte hai or inke saath sarkarein kis tarah se dhokhaa karti hai
 After all, why the government is not providing jobs, if it is not to be given, then it will be clear that we will not give it, but what is the reason for hanging the qualification examinations by hanging out for many years
 sohit mishra kaa dhanyavad jo holi ke ek din pehle bhi zaruri story lekar aa gaye, aamtaur par is din channelon ke reporter kisi gayak ko khoj rahe hote hai jo holi par ga de, jise lekar tivi kaa spes bharaa ja sake

 Silence broke out after being named in the merit list

 When will the process begin? pareshaan hokar noujvaan phone karne lage phir bhi koi jawaab nahin
 Students told that we will not get the appointment letter, because on 12 January an order has come out that the appointment process should be stopped
 hamen yakeen nahin hua or na hi ham isaki pushti kar sake
 Then on 29 January a letter from the Ministry of Communications is issued

 The January 12 order of the students was correct
 isi aadesh main niklaa tha ki ab aadesh yah jari hua he ki postal vibhaag ke 5205 naujavaanon kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kar di jaae
 When we were starting this series, the students who had been at the CAG were sending a lot of messages
 phone kar rahe the
 Was bullied
 unhone bataaya ki sieji se koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 We were very surprised
 vinod raay bol nahin paa rahe hai, magar unke baad sieji to bol hi sakati he
 It was found that the question of the employment of about 1700 youth of different posts is stuck there
 hamaari series ke dauran sieji ko pehali baar bolnaa padaa ki esayssi ne inke dogier bhej die hai
 It contains certificate, certificate of passing, etc

 These students prepare for 15-16 hours
 inhen ek ek khabar par nazar he ki kab bhartee nikali, chairman ke adhikaar kya he, kyon pariksha main deree ho rahi he
 Sohit wants you to see the audience how your young people prepare in a difficult situation and how the governments cheat with them
 aakhir sarkaar naukariyaan kyon nahin de rahi he, nahin deni he to saaf saaf kah de ki nahin denge magar form nikaalkar yogyata parikshaayen paas karakar kai-kai saal tak latakaane kaa kya tuk he
 Thanks to Sohit Mishra who came up with the essential story even a day before Holi, usually on this day, the reporters of the channels are searching for a singer who can sing on Holi, which can fill the TV space
 sohit ne khaali pet kii khaali aakankshon se is spes ko bharne ke liye mumbai se story bheji he
 Any state has a selection commission, it has made our youth cry
 unase sapane tod diye hai
 The cycle of examination is not completed for four years
 hamaari naukari series esayssi ke kaaran shuru hui thi
 From August to October 2017, the results of about 15,000 youngsters were reported
 merit list main naam aane ke baad chuppi pasar gai
 Nobody was telling when he would be appointed
 prakriya kab shuru hogi
 Troubled, the youth started calling but still no answer
 chaatro ne bataaya ki hamen niyukti patr nahin milegaa, kyonki 12 janvari ko ek aadesh niklaa he ki niyukti kii prakriya roak di jaae
 We could not believe it nor could we confirm it
 tabhi 29 janvari ko sanchaar mantralay se ek chitthee jari hoti he
 Its first line states that on 12 January the order of the Director of the Postal Department was that all circles should be stopped from the appointment of those who passed the SSC 2015 examination, till further orders
 chaatro kii 12 janvari vaale aadesh kii baat sahi thi
 In this order, it had come out that now the order has been issued that the process of appointment of 5205 youths of the Postal Department should be started
 jab ham yah series shuru kar rahe the tab sieji main jin chaatro kaa hua tha wo khub messej bhej rahe the
 Was calling tang kar diya tha
 He said that no one is talking to the CAG
 hamen kaaphi hairaani hui
 Vinod Rai is unable to speak, but the CAG can only speak after him
 pataa chalaa ki alag-alag padon ke kareeb 1700 naujavaanon kii naukari kaa sawaal vahaan atka padaa he
 During our series, the CAG had to speak for the first time that SSC has sent their dossiers
 isamen certificate, paas hone kaa pramaan patr vagairah hota he
 The result was arrived in August 2017, the dossier had not arrived for six months
 ye haal he esayssi kaa
 But after that again silence
 ham bich-bich main sieji kaa zikr karte rahe
 But on March 1, there is double good news
 kareeb 700 chaatro kii jwining kaa notification sieji kii site par aa gaya he
 The first news reported that 200 auditors have been allocated to the state CAG
 rajya mukhyalayon se ab niyukti patr milanaa shuru ho jayega
 By evening, another news came that 500 accountants have also been divided among the states
 rajyon ko inkaa dosier bheja ja rahaa, taaki niyukti patr jari ho sake
 The comments is series ke dauraan sieji ke chayaraman ne apni website par ek notification jari kiya, jisamen meri taraf ishaara kiya gaya ki ek channel buree niyat se yah sab kaam kar rahaa he
 My intention was not bad, i was sure that this series would go on until they get the letter
 esayssi ke chairman asheem khurana ji ne ek or patr website par daalaa ki inaki niyukti main esayssi kii koi bhoomika nahin he, enditivi ke ankar ko is sthiti kii jaankaree nahin he
 Now it is written in all the orders that SSC has sent the dossiers of the students, the process of recruitment is starting
 8 se 9 hazaar chaatro kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 You can ask those young people about this series
 uske pehle kitne hataash the, ab kitni aashaaon or umangon se bhare hai
 They have blossomed like the colors of Holi
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki hamaari naukari series ke baad chayan ayog sudharenge
 If it happens next year, we will do it for twenty days next year as long as i keep anchoring till then
 bahut se chaatr ab dar rahe hai
 Got the job

 You talk to them

 chaatro ne bataaya ki hamen niyukti patr nahin milegaa, kyonki 12 janvari ko ek aadesh niklaa he ki niyukti kii prakriya roak di jaae
 We could not believe it nor could we confirm it
 tabhi 29 janvari ko sanchaar mantralay se ek chitthee jari hoti he
 Its first line states that on 12 January the order of the Director of the Postal Department was that all circles should be stopped from the appointment of those who passed the SSC 2015 examination, till further orders
 chaatro kii 12 janvari vaale aadesh kii baat sahi thi
 In this order, it had come out that now the order has been issued that the process of appointment of 5205 youths of the Postal Department should be started
 jab ham yah series shuru kar rahe the tab sieji main jin chaatro kaa hua tha wo khub messej bhej rahe the
 Was calling tang kar diya tha
 He said that no one is talking to the CAG
 hamen kaaphi hairaani hui
 Vinod Rai is unable to speak, but the CAG can only speak after him
 pataa chalaa ki alag-alag padon ke kareeb 1700 naujavaanon kii naukari kaa sawaal vahaan atka padaa he
 During our series, the CAG had to speak for the first time that SSC has sent their dossiers
 isamen certificate, paas hone kaa pramaan patr vagairah hota he
 The result was arrived in August 2017, the dossier had not arrived for six months
 ye haal he esayssi kaa
 But after that again silence
 ham bich-bich main sieji kaa zikr karte rahe
 But on March 1, there is double good news
 kareeb 700 chaatro kii jwining kaa notification sieji kii site par aa gaya he
 The first news reported that 200 auditors have been allocated to the state CAG
 rajya mukhyalayon se ab niyukti patr milanaa shuru ho jayega
 By evening, another news came that 500 accountants have also been divided among the states
 rajyon ko inkaa dosier bheja ja rahaa, taaki niyukti patr jari ho sake
 The comments is series ke dauraan sieji ke chayaraman ne apni website par ek notification jari kiya, jisamen meri taraf ishaara kiya gaya ki ek channel buree niyat se yah sab kaam kar rahaa he
 My intention was not bad, i was sure that this series would go on until they get the letter
 esayssi ke chairman asheem khurana ji ne ek or patr website par daalaa ki inaki niyukti main esayssi kii koi bhoomika nahin he, enditivi ke ankar ko is sthiti kii jaankaree nahin he
 Now it is written in all the orders that SSC has sent the dossiers of the students, the process of recruitment is starting
 8 se 9 hazaar chaatro kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 You can ask those young people about this series
 uske pehle kitne hataash the, ab kitni aashaaon or umangon se bhare hai
 They have blossomed like the colors of Holi
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki hamaari naukari series ke baad chayan ayog sudharenge
 If it happens next year, we will do it for twenty days next year as long as i keep anchoring till then
 bahut se chaatr ab dar rahe hai
 Got the job

 Do not be afraid
 gandhi ji ne aazaadee kisi se darane ke liye nahin dilaai thi
 We do not celebrate the birthday of freedom heroes because they will be scared of anyone
 bank par aaj kuch nahin magar bankeron se yahi kahuunga ki agar unhen lagata he ki unase ghulaami karai ja rahi he to ve kisi ko holi ke sandesh na bhejein, na holi khele
 When there is no color, what is the color to pretend in life? aapke banker vaaki gulam kii zindagi ji rahe hai varanaa ve ek ankar ko phone kar foot-foot kar nahin rote
 You talk to them
 unhen gulaami se nikaaliye
 Bring out their suffering
 kisi bhi rajya kaa chayan ayog ho, isane hamaare naujavaanon ko rula diya he
 Dreams have been broken from them
 chaar-chaar saal tak pariksha kaa chakra puraa nahin hota he
 Our job series started due to SSC
 agast se lekar aktubar 2017 tak kareeb 15000 naujavaanon ke riselt aa gaye the
 Silence broke out after being named in the merit list
 koi bataa nahin rahaa tha ki unki niyukti kab hogi
 When will the process begin? pareshaan hokar noujvaan phone karne lage phir bhi koi jawaab nahin
 Students told that we will not get the appointment letter, because on 12 January an order has come out that the appointment process should be stopped
 hamen yakeen nahin hua or na hi ham isaki pushti kar sake
 Then on 29 January a letter from the Ministry of Communications is issued
 isaki pehali line main likhaa he ki 12 janvari ko postal vibhaag ke nideshak kaa aadesh tha ki sabhi cirkilon ko esayssi 2015 kii pariksha paas karne waalon kii niyukti roak di jaae, agle aadesh tak ke liye
 The January 12 order of the students was correct
 isi aadesh main niklaa tha ki ab aadesh yah jari hua he ki postal vibhaag ke 5205 naujavaanon kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kar di jaae
 When we were starting this series, the students who had been at the CAG were sending a lot of messages
 phone kar rahe the
 Was bullied
 unhone bataaya ki sieji se koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 We were very surprised
 vinod raay bol nahin paa rahe hai, magar unke baad sieji to bol hi sakati he
 It was found that the question of the employment of about 1700 youth of different posts is stuck there
 hamaari series ke dauran sieji ko pehali baar bolnaa padaa ki esayssi ne inke dogier bhej die hai
 It contains certificate, certificate of passing, etc
 agast 2017 main rigelt aa gaya tha, chah maheene tak dogier nahin pahunchaa tha
 This is the condition of SSC
 magar uske baad se phir khamoshi
 We kept mentioning the CAG in between
 magar 1 march ko dabl khushkhabari ai he
 The notification of joining about 700 students has come on the site of CAG
 pehle khabar ai kii 200 auditor ko rajya sieji kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 Appointment letters will now start being received from state headquarters
 shaam hote-hote duusari khabar aa gai ki 500 accountint kaa bhi rajyon kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya he
 Their dossier is being sent to the states, so that the appointment letter can be issued
 tippaniyan During this series, the chairman of the CAG issued a notification on his website, pointing out to me that one channel is doing all this with bad intentions
 meri niyat buree nahin thi, meraa iraadaa pakkaa tha ki jab tak inhen letters nahin milegaa yah series chalati jaaegi
 SSC Chairman Ashim Khurana ji put another letter on the website that SSC has no role in his appointment, the NDTV anchor is not aware of this situation
 ab saare aadesh main yahi likhaa aata he ki esayssi ne chaatro ke dogier bhej die hai, niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho rahi he
 The process of recruitment of 8 to 9 thousand students has started
 aap khud un naujavaanon se is series ke bare main puch sakate hai
 How desperate he was before, now he is filled with hopes and expectations
 ve holi ke rangon kii tarah khil uthe hai
 It is to be hoped that the selection commission will improve after our job series
 agar agle saal aisa hua to ham agle saal bhi ise bees din karenge basharte tab tak main ankaring karata rahaa to
 Many students are now afraid
 naukari mil gai he
 i understand naukari main jaakar eemaandaar bane rahiega
 Think i would have been scared or would have gone ahead after reporting it on one day, then how long the night would have been
 darana nahin he
 Gandhiji did not give freedom to fear anyone
 ham azaadi ke nayakon kaa janmdin isliye nahin manaate ki kisi se dar jaaenge
 Nothing on the bank today, but will tell the bankers that if they feel that they are being enslaved, then they should not send Holi messages to anyone or play Holi
 jab rang hi nahin he jivan main rang kaa kya dhong karnaa
 Your bankers are indeed living the life of a slave, otherwise they do not cry bitterly by calling an anchor
 aap unase baat kiijie
 Take them out of slavery
 unki pidaa ko baahar laaiye

 agle saal dilli main chunaav hai, isiilie tej barish bhi mukhyamantri shila dikshit kaa rasta nahin roak pai
 On the issue of illegal colonies, the Chief Minister reached the Union Urban Development Minister amid heavy rains
 dilli sarkaar se jin coloniyon kii list centre ko bheji gai thi, unamem se 900 coloniyon par jaldi hi baat bhi ban gai
 Demand for regularizing illegal colonies was being raised for a long time
 aise main, in coloniyon main rah rahe kareeb 40 lakh logon ke liye ye ek badi raahat he
 The special thing is also that now the preparations are being made to regularize the colonies which are in dispute
 itnaa hi nahin risettlement coloniyon ko free hold karne ke liye bhi kamalnath ne 31 taarikh ko didie kii meeting bhi bulaai he
 So that all colonies can be regularized soon
 mana ja rahaa he ki ye chunaav se pehle kii taiyaari he
 Just one hour of meeting changed the fortunes of 900 colonies
 ab ye kachi coloniyaan pakki to ho jaaengi, lekin bada sawaal ye he ki kuya in coloniyon tak sarkaar buniyadi suvidhaayen bhi pahunchaayegi
 The dispute between India and China over Doklam was not halted even now that tension has arisen over the Asaphila region
 ek baar phir se donon deshon ke bich tanaav kii sthiti banati dikh rahi he
 Amid tense atmosphere over Asafila region, Chinese Foreign Ministry says that China has never given recognition to Arunachal Pradesh
 chinividesh mantralay ke pravaktaa gen shuang nearunachal pradeshmen seemaa vivaad ko lekar kaha ki hamen aisi kisi bhi ghatana ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 China has never recognized Arunachal Pradesh
 pehle kevivadonke samaadhaan ke liye donon pakshon ko niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Meanwhile, China used new technologies in its surveillance system on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) along the Indian border
 china ne elesi par satellite varning system lagane ke saath hi new petrol boats bhi tainaat kar diya he
 Apart from this, he has also installed cameras for surveillance near the border
 is camere main cover karne ke daayre ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 China's objection a day before this, there was a report on Sunday that China has raised a strong objection to the Indian Army's patrolling in the Asafila area of arunachal Pradesh
 china ne is kshetra ko lekar phir se apana daawa thoka or bhartiya sena kii petroling ko atikaraman qaraar diya
 China claimed that the Asaphila region is part of it
 jabaki bhartiya sena ne chini sena ke in aaropon or aapattiyon ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 According to sources, China raised the issue during the Border Personnel Meeting on March 15, which was promptly rejected by the Indian Army
 yah baithak kibithu ilaake main china kii taraf daimai chaowkee par hui
 The Indian Army has also rejected China's claims in the Asafila region
 yah hamaara hissaa: bharatbharat kaa kahana he ki asphila arunachal pradesh ke subansiri kshetra kaa hissaa he ourbhartiya senise ilaake main lagaataar petroling karti aa rahi he
 Sources said that China termed the Indian Army's patrolling in the Asafila area as an encroachment, to which the Indian Army lodged a strong objection
 bhartiya sena ne asphila kshetra main china ke daavon ko bhi khaarij kiya he
 It says that Asafila is part of the Subansiri region of Arunachal Pradesh and the Indian Army has been continuously patrolling the area
 arunachal pradesh ke asphila kshetra main chini daawey ke baad paidaa hue tanaav ke bich chini ghuspaith kaa bada khulaasa hua he
 Intelligence reports have revealed that Chinese troops entered 6 km inside the Indian border near Pangong Lake in Ladakh
 bhartiya tibet seemaa police (ITBP) ne grih mantralay ko saunpi apni ek report main chini ghuspaith kii puri jaankaree di
 There has been protest before also
 On the other hand, China's opposition to patrolling the Indian Army in Asafila area is astonishing
 is ilaake main china kii sena aksar ghuspaith karti rahati he, jisko bhartiya sena gambhirtha se leti rahi he
 Earlier, China had tried to do construction work in this area, which was strongly opposed by the Indian Army
 bharat kii ore se hue virodh ke baad china ko yahaan par nirmaan kaary ko band karnaa padaa tha
 During the Border Personnel meeting, the incidents of infiltration on the border from both the countries and such issues are raised, due to which there has been a situation of tension again on the border

 In Vidisha, close to Shivraj Singh Chauhan family and former General Secretary of Kisan Morcha Ravish Chauhan has opposed this amid reports of Shivraj's wife Sadhana Singh contesting elections from Vidisha and said that if this happens then BJP will have to bear the brunt of it
 raveesh chauhan ne kaha ki vidisha se yadi sadhana singh ko tikat mila to bijepi par parivaarwaad ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagegaa
 According to Ravish, he is an old acquaintance of the Shivraj family and therefore his advice is that Sadhana Singh should contest from Vidisha by not giving tickets to Guna or Chhindwara
 raveesh ke mutabik vidisha se sadhana singh ko tikat milane par vipaksh iskaa mudda banayega or sirf vidisha hi nahin, ise madhyapradesh kii sabhi 29 loksabhaa siton par bhi bhunayega
 Ravish Chauhan says that either Shivraj Singh himself should come and contest the election from Vidisha or he should come and contest a worker himself, or else this seat will go out of hand in the Lok Sabha elections just like the assembly elections
 'main bhi daavedaar'- raveesh chouhanaravish chouhan ne iske saath hi kaha ki wo bhi pichley 30 saalon se raajnneeti main he or isliye unhone bhi vidisha loksabhaa seat se apni daavedaari thoki he
 Chauhan has said that if Sadhna Singh contests Lok Sabha elections from Guna or Chhindwara, then the party can benefit because due to 13 years Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Sadhna Singh knows the public, which will benefit the party through women voters in elections

 Earlier, regarding the formation of a strong Lokpal, social activist Anna Hazare met the leaders of the major political parties of the country from the level of his team and got his opinion expressed

 On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Left have not opened their cards yet
 jaaniye kis party ne anna ko diya kis tarah kaa aashwaasan
 
 
 bjp's stand on Lokpal: Gandhian Anna Hazare and his fellow workers met top BJP leaders, in which members of the society were assured of the support of the main opposition party on the issue of effective and strong Lokpal
 is baithak ke baad bhaajapa pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha, ‘‘hamane hazaare paksh ko aashwaasan diya he ki bhaajapa prabhavi or majboot lokapal ke gathan kii unki maang kaa samarthan karegi
 After meeting Hazare's side, the bjp's top leaders met separately to decide the party's formal stand on the Lokpal issue
 ’’anna hazaare se samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon ke saath hui baatcheet par ‘purna santushti’ jataai
 However, the formal stance of the BJP will be known only after the all-party meeting

 After this meeting which lasted about 40 minutes, Nitish indicated that he wanted to form a Lokayukta in his state based on the suggestions of the Hazare side
 nitish ne kaha, ‘‘hamane abhi hazaare paksh ke masaude kaa vistrut adhyayan nahin kiya he
 We will decide our stand on the Lokpal issue only after looking into the draft, discussing it within our own party (JD-U) and negotiating with allies
 ’’sattadhari congress kii razenna hajaare ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakat kar congress se bhi matbhed dur karnaa chaha
 Despite this, there are five main issues on which the government and Anna's team is screwed: First issue: Members of the Lokpal Selection Committee Civil Society wants the 11 members of the Lokpal Election Committee to include the PM, Leader of Opposition, and a senior minister
 The rest are non-political people

 jabaki sarkaar puri tarah ise sarkaar ke kabje main rakhane chaahati he

 Kiran Bedi, who has been known for many decades, Rough Tough and a bold image and once known as Crane Bedi, looked different on Wednesday
 kiran roj kii tarah apane ilaake krishnanagar main road sho par thim ki logon ke bich achaanak hi bhavuk ho gayi
 He said that i am thankful, i got so much love from these people
 main ise apane kaam se lautaaungi
 But as soon as Arvind Kejriwal's name came up, the emotional Kiran got a target and then did not even stop attacking, saying that Kejriwal wants to be in the news, so he talks like that
 kiran bedi ne media se kaha ki ye aapkaa faisalaa he ki negative khabar ko chalaate hai yaa nahin
 At the same time, till now, a group of Delhi-based autocrats of Kejriwal's camp reached Krishnanagar to encourage Kiran Bedi
 ve kejariwal se naaraaz bhi dikhe
 The autocrats said that Kejriwal has broken our trust, so we are supporting Kiran Ji
 kiran bedi ne bhi autowalon ko niraash nahin kiya
 While going, she said that i cannot tell everything, otherwise others will copy
 maine chipa kar rakhi hai aapke liye kai chijen
 After that said that insurance will be arranged for you, good arrangements for children and training
 dilli main autowalon kii raajnneeti nai nahin he
 In 2013, Autowale was unilaterally supporting Kejriwal, but now the picture is changing
 krishnanagar ke autowalon ke auto ke peeche bhale hi poster ab bhi aam aadmi party kaa laga ho, lekin jhanda wo bijepi kaa buland kar rahe hai
 Till now, a section of autowalists who are unilaterally supporting Kejriwal have broken down and come in support of Bedi
 auskar manoranjan kii duniya kii sabase badi trophy maani jaati he
 The trophy for this award has a different significance
 jahaan har kalakaar is trophy ko paane kaa khwab dekhtaa he
 At the same time, do you know how much the trophy is worth for this award? 
 
 sone kii parat main lipati auskar trophy dekhne main bhale hi behad mahangi dikhti ho, par isaki keemat mahaj 1 dollar he yani kareeb 65 rupee
 Let me tell you, currently the value of 1 dollar is about 65 rupees in India
 ye keemat auskar ke aadhikarik academy regulations ke anusaar he
 At the same time, the Oscar trophy is also called Golden Lady
 ek auskar trophy ko taiyaar karne main kareeb 36 hajaar rupye kaa kharch aata he, lekin bechney jaao to yah sirf 1 dollar main bikati he
 Oscars 2018: 'the Shape of Water' Best Film, Watch Crores of Rupees spent for the entire list of awards
 Crores of rupees are spent every year to get this trophy worth only $ 1
 bibisi kii ek report ke mutabik har saal hollywood auskar trophy hasil karne ke liye 6 karod se lekar 33 karod rupye tak kharch karte hai
 Conditions for selling the trophy According to Oscar's rules, the Oscar winner does not have full ownership of his trophy
 vijeta trophy ko chaahakar bhi kahin or nahin bech saktaa
 In fact, if anywhere in the world wants to sell an Oscar trophy, first of all it has to be sold to the academy giving this trophy
 vahiin academy is trophy ko sirf 1 dollar main hi kharidegi
 The reason for this is a 1951 rule, which lawfully stipulates that any Oscar should first be sold to the Academy
 jisaki keemat bhi academy hi tay karti he or philhal yah 1 dollar yani kareeb 65 rupee he
 The first Oscar trophy was priced at $ 10, according to this 1951 rule, the first academy set a price of $ 10 (600 rupees) to buy an Oscar trophy, but after 2015, this rule was changed
 saal 2015 main america kii ek adaalat ne academy ke 1951 ke niyam ko sahi tehraaya
 The academy then raised the trophy to $ 10-1
 academy regulations ke mutabik trophy ko kahin nilaamee ke liye rakhane se pehle yaa phir kahin baahar bechney se pehle ise academy ko diya janaa chahie
 Legal action will be taken against those who do not do so

 film super 30 ke anand kumaar se le kar war ke kabir tak apane transformation ke liye bhi abhinayta ko behad saraahaaja rahaa he, jise ruthik ne sirf do maheenon main hasil kiya he

Today, "the genie of information technology is not taking our time away from our hands ahead of time?" Will the traditional tools of our literature be able to keep us grounded against the modern weapons of media? ” What should be the author's politics today? In order to find solutions to many such questions, Shivamurthy may have gone out of the way to find the 'chemistry of creation', and the screen was removed from many layers of our society
 unase barabas kuch or sawaal poochne or unke uttar jaanane kaa man ho uthta he
 For example, why is literature not able to be the carrier of creating a new load in society today? Why is the interest of the new generation decreasing in him or why is he looking helpless in front of efforts to reduce it? They are also aware of this when they hear the new generation saying why there is no 'new idea' in Hindi? Or why are there only things of sorrow, struggle, why there is no new hope and hope? Shivamurthy has such questions and he seems to be trying to find answers
 dalit chetana ke ubhaar or is maamle main hindi ke 'pichhalaggupan’ par unka khud se bhi sawaal he—''phir kyon main doum praathamikta vaali samasyaon main magn rahaa?” phir ve kehete hai ''jaateey vargeekaran main hamamen se kuch log 'agade’ bhale hon lekin lekhak ke rup main ham sabhi 'pichde’ hai
 
 
 Who could tell us to walk with a torch in front, we could not even become a ready hanger
 ”shivamurti isaki vajah shaayad in panktiyon main talashte hai: ''lekhak ke hisse main aamajan kii apeksha jo bhav adhik prabal mana jaataa he, vah he samvednaa
 
 
 For this reason, he feels more deeply the misery, pain, injustice and exploitation prevailing in the society
 satta paksh ke viruddh khadaa hona ek lekhak ke liye hameshaa hi mahangaa padataa rahaa he
 
 
 Therefore, there are few examples of authors who stand in favor of the common people by doing division
 ”haalanki ve yah bhi sweekaarte hai ki ''vichaardhaara ko mul bindu maanakar kahani kaa dhaancha khadaa karnaa mere liye sambhav nahin
 "the chemistry of creation" and the raw material of the story, while fumbling, Shivamurthy opens the layers of his life with a unique story
 unhone apane ilaake ke ek lok gayak kaa zikr gajab ke chaunkaau andaaj main kiya
 When he lured the folk singer to broadcast on AIR and reward him, the folk singer said that we are happy among our own people
 isi tarah ve 'soochna-praudyogiki’ or 'media’ ke hamalon se sahitya ko bachaane ke liye jaadui yatharthwaad ke sandarbh main ek loakgeet kaa zikr karte hai: bhor bhae bhinsarva ki juniya / sita bahaarai khori / ramchandra kii pari najariya / sita bhai larakori
 It really gives that magical feeling through which literature can be saved from the flood of the current race
 lekin yah ek or satya udghaatit karata he ki hamaara samaaj kitna jeevant rahaa he
 Today, even the watchdogs of morality can go to court with the demand to remove it from folklore by considering it as objectionable! The chemistry of creation gives a taste of many stories like Mahabharata and the reader is exposed to all the questions of the past and today

 Chinese company Vivo is set to bring the first smartphone with fingerprint scanner inside the display
 iskaa concept company ne pehle hi dikhaaya tha, lekin tab yah saaf nahin tha ki ise kab launch kiya jayega
 Last week, Synaptics announced that it had fixed the problems of installing a fingerprint scanner in the display and now these sensors would be designed for top-5 smartphone vendors

 It is worth noting that till now there is no such smartphone whose fingerprint scanner is given inside the display
 lekin ab yah technology kaalpanik se asaliyat main tabdeel hone vaali he
 Tell a fact that Qualcomm is also working on a similar technology, but now Vivo has changed its course
 kyonki jab vivo ne under disple fingerprint scinar kaa prototip dikhaaya tha tab wo qolkom ke saath thi, lekin ab qolkom nahin balki sineptic ke saath mil kar company apane smartphone ke disple main fingerprint scinar degi
 Tech analyst Patrick Moorehead tweeted

 This decision of the government has proved that by going a step ahead of the policy of Muslim appeasement, it has now openly supported the terrorists
 'pathak ne kaha ki gorakhpur main hue silsilewar bam visphot ke mukhya aaropee ke virudgh nyaayalay main vichaaradhin mukademen main faisla aane se pehle hi sapa sarkaar ne use begunaah hone kaa praaanpatr dekar deshbhakt janata ke saath bada vishwasghaat kiya he
 He said that on the one hand Akhilesh government is failing to stop the rising crimes and atrocities on women on the other hand, on the other hand, by withdrawing the cases of criminals and accused of terrorist incidents, is pushing the state towards anarchy

 keshav maury ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki ram mandir kaa mudda supreme court main he isliye pradhanmantri narendra modi or siem yogi iske nirmaan par faisla nahin le sakate hai

 UP Deputy CM said that we understand the sentiments of saints
 lekin congress ke kaaran ram mandir ke nirmaan main deree hui
 Those of the opposition who are doing politics on this matter will remember that CM Yogi had announced the construction of a grand Ram idol in Ayodhya at the last Diwali function

 But a grand temple will definitely be built on the birthplace of Ramlala in Ayodhya, we cannot tell when the date will be built

 "significantly, amid the ongoing discussion on temple construction, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will remain in Ayodhya today

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) April 29, 2019 Story of what will happen? After watching the Avengers endgame, people are questioning what will happen next? Answering this question, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige told Screen Rant in an interview with, "I think the one thing that is most interesting about the timeline of the film in our case is that these characters have a great past
 Is, and there is a possibility of future stories about it
 " to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye he ki maarval kii agali film ek prikval film ho sakati he
 Marvel has been showing old stories of the characters before
 aise vakt main jab purana saal 2010 ja chukaa he or nae saal 2011 kaa aagaaj ho chukaa he, film jagat ke pratishthit movie masala award 2010 kaa elaan ho gaya he
 This time, the movie Masala Award was dominated by Salman Khan's film Dabangg
 kul 6 shreniyon main se paanch ke award film 'dabang' kii jholii main gaye
 The best actress award was given to actress Katrina Kaif for her strong performance in the film Rajiniti
 lagata he ki dabang logon ke dimag par is kadar chaa gai ki unhone use hi sabhi shreniyon main apni pasand bana diya
 Whether it was the best actor or the best film, Dabangg retained its charm
 janata ne salmaan khan ke chulbul pandey ke kirdaar ko khub saraahaa or unhen sarvshereshth abhinayta chunaa
 The effect of the Munni Badnaam song is still speaking to the heads of the people, that's why people chose this song as the best song
 sarvshereshth nirdeshak kaa award bhi dabang ke nirdeshak abhinay kashyap ko hi mila jabaki is film se apane filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaali abhinetri sonakshi sinha ko sarvshereshth navdith kalakaar ke puraskaar ke liye chunaa gaya
 The public voted Salman as the best actor with 52 per cent of the votes while Sonakshi Sinha got 60 per cent
 vahiin 'munni badnaam' gane ne 54 fisadi vot hasil kiye or 'dil to baccha he ji' or 'shila kii javaani' jaise gaanon ko pachhad diya

 a few hours after Rahul Gandhi's speech, in Mumbai at an event, former chief of Tata and Sons, with RSS chief Bhagwat, shared the taunting platform and said that religion means brotherhood
 mumbai main yojit naanaa paalkar janmashatabdi varsh or naanaa paalkar smriti samiti suvarna mahotsavi varsh saangta samarohame ratan tata vishesh atithi ke rup main maujuud the
 While Sarsanghchalak Mohan Rao Bhagwat of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was present as the chief guest of the program
 naanaa paalkar smriti samiti aresas se sambandhit gaiyr sarkari sanghathan he or yah bimaaron kii seva karti he
 Earlier, the RSS chief met Ratan Tata in December 2016 at the Sangh headquarters
 jabaki is saal june main purv raashtrapatipranab mukherjeenagpur sthit aresas ke mukhyalay main sangh ke ek kaarykram main shaamil hue the
 At the beginning of his speech, Bhagwat said, 'like everyone present at the event, i was excited that Ratan Tata ji would speak something from the stage today, i asked him that if you speak today, he said that he has difficulty in speaking
 'sangh pramukh ne aage kaha, 'kuch log hote hai jo bolne main sahaj mahasoos nahin karte, lekin unka kaam bolta he
 While some people are kept to speak and they have to speak as i am
 'unhone apane sambodhan main swargeey naanaa paalkar ke kaaryon kaa sansmaran kiya or kaha ki upasthit logon ko unke kaaryon se prerana lete hue kaam karnaa chahie
 Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Bhagwat said that the meaning of religion is to connect everyone and not to distribute, it serves to raise the society
 dharm kaa matlab hi he bhaichara
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while addressing the people at the London-based think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies, today said, "rss's thinking is like the Brotherhood of Muslim organizations in Arab countries
" aresas bharat kii prakruti ko badalane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Other parties have never attacked India for capturing institutions, but the RSS is doing
 ' bijepi kii ore se is bhaashan par joardaar jawaab diya ja chukaa he
 The CM said that according to the report of the committee, elections will be held, the atmosphere regarding 370 in the state is in favor of the BJP
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne kaha he ki hamane swytt shashan mantri shanti dhariwal ke netritv main cameti kaa gathan kiya he
 According to the report of the committee of that formation, elections will be held
 darasal, congress kii andruni baithak main kai vidhayakon or mantriyon ne kaha he ki rajya main abhi 370 ko lekar maahaul bijepi ke paksh main bana hua he or aise main bada chunaav hota he to iske parinaam loksabhaa chunaav jaise ho sakate hai
 In view of this, it was said that the election of the mayor was done through the councilors
 is par mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne kaha ki hamen bhi is tarah ke input mili hai
 It will be considered
 ashok gahalot ne kaha ki kaaryakarta sarvopari hota he
 In fact, the last time Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot passed a bill in the Legislative Assembly and made a law that now the public will directly elect the Mayor, not the councilor in the municipal corporations
 bijepi ne satta main aane ke baad us kanoon ko khatm kar diya tha magar rajya main ek baar phir se mukhyamantri banane ke baad gahalot sarkaar dobaaraa vidhansabha main yah kanoon le ai thi
 In March this year, this law was made under which the election of the Mayor will be done directly by the public
 rajasthan ke sabhi 6 nagar nigamon main janata ke sidhe meyar chune jane kaa praavdhaan kar diya gaya he
 The state elections are to be held in late October or early November
 aise main is tarah ke input aane ke baad rajya sarkaar ke liye faisle se ekaek peeche hatana aasaan nahin hoga
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has constituted the committee and the process of direct election will be abolished through an ordinance citing the committee report
 vahiin bijepi kaa is puure maamle par kahana he ki congress chunaav ladane se pehle hi haar gai he
 Fear is looking for excuses to change his own law
 duniya ke kuch bade kendriya bainkon ne maujuuda aarthik sankat se nipatane ke liye ek yojana kaa elaan kiya he
 The US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Canada, Japan and Switzerland's central banks have said that they will cheapen the purchase of US dollars so that funds can be easily provided to the common people and traders
 saste america dollar ke alaava ye bank jarurat padane par paanch disambar se duniya kii kai anya pramukh mudraon ko bhi aasaani se muhaiyaa karaayenge
 After this news, a bounce is being seen in the stock markets across the world
 jamarni, france or britain ke share upar chadhe hai
 The banks have benefited more from this boom
 jab bhi baadh aati he ham baadh ko aapadaa kii tarah cover karne lagate hai
 The entire government machinery starts building relief camps and the chief minister visits by helicopter
 ab kuch log god main bhi daura karne lage hai
 This shows what we know and what we do not know about the flood and at times it seems that we do not mean to know anything
 channelon par baadh kii jo tasviren tair rahi hai wo kyon sirf tabaahi kaa manzar pesh karti hai
 Is the story of flood only a loss of property and property
 jab hamen skool se lekar college tak yahi padhaayaa gaya he ki baadh acchhee chiz he, to ham baadh ko lekar jashn kyon nahin manaate hai
 Have we ever thought about the impact of the floodplain land and its fertility
 agar main yah kahuun ki desh ke kai ilaakon main baadh ai he, bahut acchhee baadh ai he or ye bahut acchhee baat he to ek darshak ke naate aapaki pratikriya kya hogi
 When teachers used to say the same thing in school and college, what was your reaction? jab aap bhi bahut mehnat se yaad karke imtahaanon main likhte the ki baadh aati he to uske saath pahaado se upjau gaad maidaanon kii taraf aata he
 a new layer of soil is formed with nutrients
 pune ke professor vishwaas kaale se hamane poocha to unhone kaha ki baadh nadi kii jivan prakriya kaa ahm hissaa he
 The life cycle of the river is not complete without flooding
 baadh ke saath aane vaali nai mitti ke kaaran kheton kii urvartaa kaaphi bad jaati he
 This is the reason why farming has been taking place in the ganga-yamuna plain for thousands of years, but the fertility there never decreased
 desh kii pachaas karod kii aabaadi ganga-yamuna ke maidan main basati he
 Not only this, the river channel is constantly clearing due to floods
 badi yaa choti nadiyaan apane saath saamaanya samay main jo cediment, ret-pathar apane saath laati hai or kinaaron ke aasapaas jamaa karti jaati hai, usase nadi kaa channel sankara or uthlaa hota jaataa he jisase nadiyon main pani bahane kii jagah kam hoti jaati he
 When a major flood occurs, it takes this entire silt forward and keeps the river channels clear
 naale ke rup main sankuchit ho chuki nadi phir se fail jaati he
 The floods of the river liberate the areas on which its banks are occupied from the sand mafia to the land mafia
 baadh aane se nadiyon ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main underground water richarge hota he, jo saal ke baaki samay main pani kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke kaam aata he
 The larger the area that will be flooded, the more the area will have water recharge
 hamane baadh par puri zindagi adhyayan karne vaale professor dinesh mishra se baat kii
 There are very few people who research floods
 main chahta tha ki ve 'prime time' main aa jaaen, lekin unhen aaj kisi yatra par janaa tha
 When i asked Prof
 Mishra whether flood was a disaster, there was catastrophe, his reply was that flood is not a disaster for Bihar
 agar aapadaa hoti, tabaahi laati to bihar main jansankhya kaa ghanatv kaaphi kam hota
 People would leave the state
 koi apni zamin chhod kar isliye nahin jaataa, kyonki bihar kii zamin isi baadh ke kaaran upjau he
 The water level here is good, that is why you do not see women carrying water from far away, like Haryana or Rajasthan
 pro mishra ne kaha ki baadh ek laabhadaayak dhandha he
 After 9 years in Bihar, there has been such a flood, due to which the land here has been revived
 jab kosi kii baadh ai thi tab anupam mishra ne ek lekh likhaa tha - tairne vaala samaaj dub rahaa he
 He said that the flood was not a guest
 wo achaanak nahin aati he, balki uske aane kii taarikh tay he
 This is why we treat him like a calamity when a flood comes
 anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki sochiye jab sarkarein nahin thim, helicopter nahin tha tab log baadh se kaise apni raksha karte honge, kyonki jis zamin par ve rahete aae hai, vahaan baadh to sadiyon se aa rahi he
 We have settled in the path of flood, flood never comes in our way
 baadh se tabaahi kyon hoti he
 One reason is that we have all encroached on the banks of the river
 chunki kai saal tak baadh nahin aati he, isliye ham sochate hai ki baadh kabhi nahin aegi
 Then we start working on the idea of connecting rivers in different ways
 kuch kaa kuch dimag lagaate chalate hai
 But one day there is flood
 ab puuchhiye ki janmaal kaa nuksaan kyon hota he
 Can it be saved aap jaanate hai ki bharat main baba aadam ke jamaane se baadh kii bhavishyavaanee kii ja rahi he
 This prediction is made on the basis of the danger mark
 aap samaacharon main sunate bhi honge ki falaan jagah par ganga yaa punpun kaa pani khatare ke nishaan se itnaa centimetre upar bah rahaa he to baadh aegi
 At around 175 places in the country, such danger marks have been made, on the basis of which the flood is predicted
 is system ko gej tu gej korelation kehete hai
 Like you heard that the water of the Ganges in Patna is flowing above the danger mark
 iske liye kareeb saath-sattar kimi pehle ek or jagah par jalastr ko napa jaataa he
 It has a historical data, on the basis of which it is said that if the water there is above the danger mark, then flood water will come in Patna's Mahendru Ghat or LCT Ghat
 yadi aap patna ke puraane darshak hai to yaad kiijie ham or aap bachapan main kaise bans ghat yaa mahendru ghat jate the, yah dekhne ki kitni sidhiyon tak pani aa gaya he
 If water reaches such a ladder, the flood water will enter the city
 jaahir he isse pataa chalata he ki jal str se baadh kaa khatara naapane kaa system lok jivan kaa hissaa ban gaya hoga
 This would have made an accurate prediction, only then from the government to the common citizens believe in this prediction
 radio anounsar jab khanakdaar awaz main kehete the ki patna main ganga kaa jalastr khatare ke nishaan se das centimetre upar bah rahaa he
 On hearing this, people used to go to the terrace with potato onions
 aasmaan main dekhne lagate the ki helicopter se chanaa or biscuit koi giraayega
 But gradually, all the pictures of the flood were devastated
 log marane lage, makaan doobane lage or kitna kuch nasht hone laga
 Why did this happen
 hamane is kshetra ke ek or jaankaar se baat kii
 He says that India has a system of water level forecasts, that is, forecasts based on water level
 bharat ko ab flud forcast karnaa chahie yani yah bataanaa chahie ki aapke ilaake main baadh kaa pani kab tak aayega, kitna upar chadhega or kab tak rahegaa
 This probably happens in the rest of the world
 paanch chah din pehle se alert jari hone lagate hai
 If there were flood forecasts in India, hundreds of people would not have died due to floods in Chennai, people would not have died by drowning in their own houses
 agar hamen baadh se hone vaale nuksaan ko rokna he to flud forcast kii taraf kadam badhaane honge
 At present, the water level is predicted by the Central Water Commission
 jalastr kii bhavishyavaanee kii ek seemaa he
 You measure the danger mark at two places between fifty-sixty km, but there is no system of prediction if water suddenly comes in the middle and spreads to the surrounding area
 jaise maan lijie chennai ke kinare kii nadi main jal str bad gaya lekin baari varsha ke kaaran shahar main pani kii maatra duusari taraf se bad gai
 Now there should be a system of calculating it and how deep the flood is going to happen in Chennai
 isliye jo log pehali manzil ke makaan main rah rahe hai unhen kam se kam do manzila makaan kii chat par janaa hoga
 it does not happen

 Where there are no rivers, there is flooding from storm water
