 chhattisgarh meiambikapurke sarkari medical college se hairaan karne vaala video saamne aayaa he
 In this medical college, along with doctors, tantra-mantras also treat patients
 medical college ke vaardon main doctoron, baigaa, gunia, baba or tantric bhi marijon kaa ilaaj karte he
 The medical college administration argues that there is a medical staff in their wards at all times, so there is no question of the presence of those who are getting treatment with the broom
 magar medical college ke saamaanya vardo se ai ye tasviren unhen munh chidhaa rahi he
 Actually, a video has exposed the inside of the Government Medical College of Ambikapur
 yah video marij ke ek parijan ne banaaya tha, is videon main dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah se medical or surgery ward main doctoron ke alaava neem hakim bhi marijon kaa ilaaj karte he
 The medical ward of this medical college has many patients suffering from orthopedic to common diseases
 is medical college main allopathy se hi marijon kaa ilaaj hota he, yah kahana jaraa mushkil dikh rahaa he
 All the patients admitted in this ward are aware of his method of treatment
 yah shaks ambikapur kaa janaa-mana neem hakim he, iskaa naam shiv baba he
 Shiva Baba treats the patients by sweeping
 kabhi marijon ke ghar main to kabhi medical collejon main upasthit ho kar apana hunar dikhaate he
 That too through his medical practice, a patient's family Hemlal told that he is not getting benefit from allopathy
 isliye unhone shiv baba se bhi ilaaj karana jaruri samajha
 Hemlal's brother's leg was broken, he has been admitted here for a month
 aisa nahin he ki medical vardo main neem hakimon kii maujuudagi kii khabar medical prashasan ko nahin he
 But it is said that there is a relation between doctors and quacks
 jab doctor marijon kaa chekup karne ke liye aate hai to neem hakim aspataal se dooriyaan bana lete hai
 And when the quacks treat the patients in their own way, then do the para medical staff also break their ties with the hospital

 Of the total sanctioned 180 posts, only 26 doctors are posted
 iskaa sidhaa asar aspataal prabandhan par bhi pad rahaa he

 bharat dwaara jaish-e-mohammadpramukh moulana masood ajahar ke khilaaf pakistan sarkaar se karrwai kii maang kaa asar hota dikh rahaa he
 According to information received from sources, the Pakistan government is planning to take action against Masood Azhar
 sutron kaa kahana he ki haalanki pakistan sarkaar aisa karte samay bharat ke dabaav main nahin dikhnaa chaahati he
 This is the reason why Pakistan is not in favor of action like putting Masood Azhar in jail
 khabar he ki pakistan sarkaar is baat par bhi vichaar kar rahi he ki yuanessi dwaara masood ajahar ko global aatankiyon ke list main shaamil karne kaa vah virodh na kare
 If the Government of Pakistan does so, then the basis of using veto power in opposition to Masood from China will also be over
 bataa den ki masood ajahar ko lekar yues, euke or france ne nayaa prastaav pesh kiya he
 China has a chance to use the veto by 13 March regarding this proposal
 sutron ke anusaar madus ajahar ko lekar imran khan sarkaar beete kuch dinon se is manthan main lagi he ki aakhir aise ‘indivijuls' kaa saath dekar kya pakistan ko kya mil rahaa he
 The army of Imran Khan is also seen behind this thinking or some say that Imran Khan is getting full support of the army there that there will be no exaggeration
 army ke saport kii vajah se hi bharat ke wing commander abhinandan kii rihaai ke baad imran khan ko pakistan main koi virodh nahin jhelana padaa
 It is believed that if Nawaz Sharif's government had taken this decision, there would have been slogans like 'modi's friend Pakistan's traitor' in Pakistan
 'wing commander ko chhodane ke imran khan sarkaar ke faisle kaa pakistan main kisi bhi raajnneetik party ne virodh nahin kiya, yahaan tak kii ise lekar koi bada virodh pradarshan bhi nahin hua
 According to government sources, the government of Pakistan is preparing to take some tough decisions in the national interest
 isaki ek vajah yah he ki pakistan in dinon aarthik morche par kadi chunautiyaan jhel rahaa he
 He can not get out of the gray list of the Financial Action Task Force without showing strong attitude towards terrorism and overcoming it

 '' After the Supreme Court's decision on Monday in the Vyapam case, Congress has once again attacked Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 madhya pradesh congress adhyaksh arun yadav ne court ke faisle ke baad siem shivaraj ke istife kii maang kii he
 Let us tell you that while hearing the Madhya Pradesh Vyapam recruitment scam on Monday, the Supreme Court has canceled the admission of more than 500 students
 ye wo chaatr hai jinhen 2008 se 2012 ke bich embibies course main daakhila diya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court ruled that the admission of all these were against the rules and canceled the admission of 634 students
 supreme court kaa faisla aate hi congress mukhar ho gai
 Arun Yadav alleged that Shivraj Singh Chauhan calls himself uncle, then the children's 'uncle' should take moral responsibility and resign from his post
 congress ke mahasachiv or madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne bhi supreme court ke faisle ke baad twit karte hue likhaa ki empi main vyapam dwaara medical college main paisa le kar kii gayibhartee ko avaidh maanakar supreme court ne radd kar diya
 Our allegation has been found correct
 iske alaava digvijay singh ne twit kar kaha ki jinhone farzi bhartee kii rup rekha banaai, dhokhaa diya, paise liye unka kuch nahin hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party raised the question, besides the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party also alleged after the court's decision that corruption has spoiled the future of the students and the real culprits are still free
 aam aadmi party ke madhya pradesh sanyojak alok agarwal ne kaha ki vyapam ke asli aaropee aaj jail se baahar hai

 mishael obama ko bhale hi duniya america kii first ladi ke taur par jaanati he
 But beyond this identity, Michelle is a person full of confidence
 jisane duniya main apane dam par ek pahchaan banaai hai
 a glimpse of this was found recently, when Michelle addressed the graduates at the City College in New York
 is program main mishael ne students ko exam ke grad or jindagi ke exam ke bare main bataaya
 It is important to face the problems
 Michele started her speech telling her experience and said that the most important thing in life is how do you cope with the problems that come from your experience and knowledge
 yahi aapaki asli jeet hoti he
 Learn to balance in bad times
 He told me that before coming to Rashtrapati Bhavan, i worked in the post of Dean in the college
 jahaan maine aise tamaam student ko dekha jinhen parivaar se har tarah kaa saport mila tha
 He lived a life of luxury
 lekin jab kabhi unke bure grad aa jate to wo apana balance nahin bana pate
 They felt as if everything was lost
 isaki vajah thi ki unhone jindagi ke exam ko paas karnaa nahin aata tha
 So never forget that there are many troubles in life which are much worse than your bad grade
 unka samaanaa karo puri tarah datakar
 Bring flexibility and seriousness in yourself
 You meet people who are not responsible in everyday life, they have all the arguments to keep their point right and above
 rojaanaa aisi kai samasyaayein bhi aati hai, jinaki vajah aap nahin hote phir bhi aapako unka saamana karnaa hota he
 Keep flexibility and seriousness inside yourself at such times
 aisa karne se aap khud ko behatar bana sakenge
 You will be able to get out easily from the situation which had come to dominate you

" takhtapalat kii koshish main pahaado se girakar chotil bijepi kaa sheersh netritv sahamaa hua to he lekin usne ummiido kii door chodi nahin he
 Therefore, the BJP, which is backward in the political washout, is now working on a strategy for image improvement as well as keeping in mind the social and geographical equation

 a leader's comment on the bjp's preparedness for a possible assembly election in january-february next year also exposes the awe of the party
 ve kehete hai, ''party kii koshish he ki kam se kam dilli-bihar vidhansabha chunaav jaisaa hashr na ho, jahaan hamaare saamne party ke bajaae ek vyakti centre bana tha or ham uski chhavi ko dhoomil karnaa to dur, apni saakh bhi nahin bachaa paae the

 However, the Congress camp also questioned whether the 10 rebels who went to BJP have gone free
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa anil baluni aarope jadte hai, ravat sarkaar bhrashtachar main aakanth dubi he or ravat aise netaa hai jinhone alag uttarakhand ke andolan kaa virodh kiya tha

 If sources are to be believed, the bjp's focus will be more on the Garhwal region, so the party has made up its mind to give tickets to all these 10 rebels in the election

 BJP strategists say that the negative image among the Dalit and Muslim voters only worsens its electoral equation
 isliye is baar party ne sabhi 70 vidhansabha kshetron main essi sammelan karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 The BJP has moved towards creating a social bouquet of Dalit voters along with Brahmins, Rajputs, Vaishyas

 "the reason for our last defeat in Uttarakhand was internal factionalism," says a senior BJP leader
 yah jari rahi to jeetna asambhav ho jayega
 73-year-old Koshyari was expected to be inducted into the Narendra Modi cabinet but was replaced by Ajay Tamta, a Dalit MP in a strategic sense
 dabaav banane ke liye aakhri daanv ke taur par koshyari ne 2019 main raajnneeti se sanyas kaa elaan kar diya he
 In the past Satpal Maharaj has openly opposed him

 He had never seen the appearance of school and could not even write his name
 lekin aaj 14 saal kaa ye baccha auskar ke liye nominete hui film 'capraneyam' kaa star he, norge main rahane laga he or skool bhi jane laga he
 a film changed Jain's life overnight
 jain or uskaa parivaar pichley chah maheenon se norge main rah rahe hai
 Jain and her three siblings are going to school for the first time in their lives
 filmmekar nadin labaki kii is film main jain ek aise bachche kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahaa he jiskaa janm lebanon main hua he lekin aadhikarik taur par wo kisi desh kaa nahin he kyonki uske parents ke paas uske janm ko register karaane ke paise nahin hote he
 He gets very upset with his circumstances and files a case against his own parents because despite being born they are unable to take care of him
 jain kii real life kahani bhi kam chunauteepurn nahin he
 Zain's father, Ali Ar Rafia, said, "we are Syrians and we decided to come to Lebanon in 2012 in view of war-like conditions and violent conditions in Syria
" 'lebanon ke shahar bayrut main yuddh jaisi paristhiti se to chhutkaaraa mil gaya lekin kaam kii kami or mahangi jagah hone ke chalate zindagi guzar basar karne main dikkatein aane lagi
 The Lebanese administration is against giving Permanent place to Syrian refugees in their country
 yahi kaaran he ki vahaan aadhikarik rifuji camps nahin he or vahaan syria ke log keval kheti-baadi, saaf safai or construction jaise sectors main hi kaam kar sakate hai
 Jain's father said, 'our economic conditions were very bad
 main din-raat mehnat kar rahaa tha
 Despite this, my family was barely able to survive
 'film ke casting diarector jis samay bayrut main the, us dauraan 12 saal kaa jain gali main apane doston ke saath khel rahaa tha
 Jain also used to work to support his family members

 Filmmaker Nadine Labaki said, "when i saw Jain, i thought that how comfortable and sensible this boy is, his future should not be wasted in these slums
" film release hui or ise darshakon kaa jabardast rispons mila
 Jain also became extremely popular with the release of this film
 haalanki lebanon se risettle hokar duusare desh janaa aasaan nahin he
 According to an estimate, out of the 9 lakh and a half Refugees living in Lebanon, only 9,000 Refugees were able to settle elsewhere in 2018, but after the fame of this film, Jain's family has managed to shift to Norway
 ali ne kaha - 'mujhe apane bacchon kaa bhavishya andhakaarmay dikh rahaa tha
 But now i can hope that my children can also become engineer doctors by studying
 lekin pehle to main is tarah ke sapanom ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Even though Jain's life may not have changed in the film, Jain's life in real life has changed completely and Jain is a classic example of how cinema can change people's lives overnight

 Mehta said that the exact figures will be available on Monday
 unhone kaha ki agar antim ghante main baari matdaan hua hoga to matdaan kaa pratishat 60 fisadi ko paar kar saktaa he
 In the last election held in 2007, the voting percentage was just 42
 78 fisadi rahaa tha
 Both Congress and BJP claimed their party's victory in the elections
 dilli congress pramukh je pi agarwal ne kaha ki vah apni party kii jeet ko lekar ‘100 fisadi’ aashwast hai jabaki unke bhaajapa ke samakaksh vijender gupta ne kaha ki unki party teenon nigamon main jeet darj karne ja rahi he
 The counting of votes will take place on Tuesday

 aparaadh rokane main naakaam indore police-prashasan ne apni naakamayaabi kaa thikra dawaaiyon par phoda he
 The police issued a unique order not only prohibiting the city drug stores from openly selling five types of medicines related to insomnia and depression, but also ordered the doctors to submit the original prescription of the doctor and keep the bill records
 Huh
 aadesh kii avhelnaa karne vaale vikreta ke khilaaf rasuka kii karrwai hogi
 This impractical order, implemented from August 1, has surprised the drug dealers and doctors, while the difficulties of patients have increased
 sawaal yah bhi he ki pratibandh sirf shahari seemaa tak lagaaya gaya he jabaki aasapaas ke kshetra main ye dawaaen aasaani se uplabdh hai
 These are medicines that are used as diabetes, cardiovascular, psychiatric and pain relievers
 lekin police kaa daawa he ki nitravett naam kii dawa shahar ke yuvaaon main aparaadh kii pravriti badha rahi he
 In the excitement of this drug, even such youth committed murders, who never had any criminal record

 jain kehete hai, ''rogiyon ko ye dawaaen simit maatra main di jaati hai
 Excessive intake may increase aggression
 ''rasuka ke dar se kai dawa vikrataaon ne ye dawaaen hi rakhni band kar di hai
 According to the order, the drug dealers have started to submit the original prescription of the doctor, which is a matter of reflection for the patients, because the seller will deposit the original slip, then every time a prescription will have to be written to buy the medicine and every time the doctor will have to pay a consultation fee
 shahar main pichley paanch saal main hue aparaadhon kaa record khangaalane or aropiyon kaa manovishleshan karne ke baad police ne 12 tarah kii dawaaon ko khuleam bechney par pratibandh kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 But only five drugs — alprazolam, clonazipam, diazepam, nitrazipam and lorazipam — were banned from open sale after discussion with city representatives, drug dealers and doctors
 police ke aalaa adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki isse ek had tak aparaadhon ko niyantrit karne main madad milegi jabaki shahar ke kareeb 1,500 khudara dawa vikritaon or chikitsakon kaa kahana he ki police ko apni naakamayaabi kii vajah dawa kii parchi main dhundhane par kuch hasil nahin hone vaala
 Vinay Bakaliwal, president of the Indore Drug Dealers Association, says that these drugs are given during and after the operation
 aise samay main kai baar nurse hi dawa kii parchi bana detii he lekin vikreta ab yah parchi sweekaar nahin kar rahe
 In such a situation, patients are getting tested for medicine
 nursing home association kii adhyaksh dow
 Sunanda Jain says that these medicines are also given to women undergoing menopause, but two to three months of medicines are not written on a prescription
 ab marij ko har baar parchi lene aana padegaa
 Although the President of Indore Medical Association, Dr
 anil bandi kehete hai ki isse aparaadh rokane main madad milti he to unka puraa samarthan police-prashasan ke saath he
 IG Sanjay Rana, who is spearheading this campaign, says that there is a provision under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act that certain types of medicines cannot be purchased without a doctor's prescription, they are strictly enforcing the same rule
 yah pratibandh dawa vikritaon or chikitsakon kii rajamandi se hi lagaaya gaya he
 However, there is no problem with surveillance, so an investigation team is being formed with them
 police-prashasan ke anokhe aadesh se hairaan chikitsa tantra''kanuunan kuch khaas kism kii davaaiyaan chikitsak kii parchi ke bagaiyr nahin kharidi ja saktin
 We are just strictly enforcing the same law

 These satirical compositions, which hurt at the dislocations spread at the topical, political, social, administrative levels, sometimes evoke but do not leave the expected impact due to the flat-bottomedness
 lekhak kaa yah maananaa he ki aaj ke daur main hamaari khaal moti hone ke kaaran kisi par vyangy kii maarak shakti kaa asar nahin ho rahaa he
 But to change the form of challenge in desperation is a sign of competent satirist

 In Jharkhand, the formation of a new government under the leadership of bjp's Arjun Munda within the next two days is believed to be almost certain, due to which the 20-day dilemma about forming a government here is likely to end
 nayi sarkaar ke gathan ke liye sakriy purv mukhyamantri arjuna munda ne rajya ke mukhyamantri shibu sorain or bhaajapa vidhanmandal dal ke sadasyon se kai daur kii mulaakaat ke baad somvaar ko kaha 'nayi sarkaar ke gathan kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he or bahut jaldi hi yahaan bhaajapa ke netritv main sarkaar gathit ho jaayegi
 Asked under whose leadership the new government would be formed from the state, Munda said, "we have been asked to talk to JMM, AJSU, JD (U) and independents for formation of new government here at present and hope that i will do this work till Tuesday
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon ne naam na prakashit karne kii shart par bataaya ki mangalvaar yaa buudhvaar ko hi nayi sarkaar ke gathan ke swaroop ke bare main antim faisla kar liya jaayegaa or buudhvaar tak nayi sarkaar kii tajposhi arjuna munda ke netritv main ho jane kii sambhaavna he
 Meanwhile, the voice of protest emerging in the JMM regarding the formation of a government under the leadership of the BJP has also stagnated in view of the preparations to form the government under the leadership of Arjun Munda
 ravivaar ko jhamumon ke adhiktar vidhayakon ne shibu sorain se mulaakaat ke baad kaha ki guruji jo faisla karenge vah unhen manjuur hoga
 He was in favor of keeping Guruji as the Chief Minister, but if he would agree to form a government under the leadership of the BJP here, he would accept it in front of his decision
 isse pehle bhaajapa sansadeey board kii dilli main hui baithak main yah tay kiya gaya tha ki jharkhand ke liye naye mukhyamantri kaa naam yahaan ke vidhayakon or saansadon kii raishumaari ke bad tay kiya jaayegaa
 For this task, BJP President Nitin Gadkari sent former BJP President Rajnath Singh and BJP General Secretary Ananth Kumar as Central Supervisors here
 bhaajapa ke kendriya paryvekshakon ne yahaan ke party ke 18 vidhayakon evam saansadon tathaa anya netaaon se mukhyamantri ke ummivaar ke bare main vistrut vichaar vimarsh kar apni report party adhyaksh, nitin gadakari ko de di thi jiske baad jaise hi bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv yahaan sarkaar ke gathan ke bare main antim faisla karnaa chahta tha
 Instead of making public its decision to avoid any kind of gritty, the former Chief Minister of the state called Arjun Munda and asked him to start the exercise to form a government in the state
 82 sadasyeey jharkhand vidhansabha main bhaajapa or jhamumon ke 18-18 sadsy he, jabaki uske anya sahyogi dalon ol jharkhand students unio (ajsu) or jad (you) ke vidhaan sabha main kramash: paanch evam do sadsy he
 Apart from these, two independents and others also have the support of the coalition government
 arjuna munda ne ravivaar ko mukhyamantri shibu sorain ke ghar pahunch kar ek baar unke bete or jhamumo vidhayak dal ke netaa hemanth sorain or dobaaraa mukhyamantri shibu sorain se mulaakaat kii
 He also met several other JMM leaders and mlas
 arjuna munda ne apni mulaakaat main shibu sorain or hemanth se rajya main gathit hone vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ke liye samarthan maanga or nayi sarkaar ke swaroop ke bare main bhi vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Later he reached the BJP office and there he held several rounds of talks with all the senior party leaders and party mlas including bjp's National vice-president Karuna Shukla Assembly Speaker CP Singh
 unhone daawa kiya ki rajya main sarkaar ke gathan kii prakriya main kisi bhi prakaar kii koi kathinaayee nahin he or bhaajapa ke netritv main jald hi nayi sarkaar kaa gathan ho jaayegaa
 It is believed that both parties have agreed to run the government for 28-28 months in the state and the BJP will take charge of the government in this shift
 is samjhaute par rajamandi se jhamumon main aam taur par khushi he, kyonki uskaa maananaa he ki use rajya kii sarkaar main aadhe kaa haq chahie tha, jo mil gaya he
 Sources in the BJP said that most of the BJP mlas and several mps of the state have suggested the name of senior BJP leader Arjun Munda for the post of Chief Minister, due to which the party has put its name on it
 bas aadhikarik taur par uski ghoshnaa hona baaki he
 His being a tribal is also going in his favor because the JMM, the main ally of the BJP here, has been continuously demanding here that the BJP should make any tribal here the chief minister
 jharkhand rajya ke varsh 2000 main hue gathan ke baad se hi yaha sabhi mukhyamantri adivasee hi rahe he
 The current Deputy Chief Minister Raghuvar Das, who emerged as a rival to his Chief Minister, is not a tribal and he has got the open support of only a few people among the party's mlas

 42-year-old Arjun Munda had previously been the Chief Minister of Jharkhand in the year 2003 and also in the year 2005
 varsh 2003 main march maah main unhone bhaajapa ke rajya ke pratham mukhyamantri babulal marandi se rajya kii bagdor sanbhali thi

 Arjun Munda, a resident of Gorabandh in Jamshedpur, started the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha politics in the 1980s after earning a bachelor's degree in social science
 unhone kharsanva vidhansabha kshetra se varsh 1995, 2000 or 2005 main vidhansabha chunaav jeeta tha
 He reached Delhi after winning the Lok Sabha elections held in May last year
 rajya bhaajapa se jab babulal marandi ne aantarik raajnneeti main arjuna munda ke aage shikast khaakar varsh 2006 main naata tod liya or jharkhand vikaas morcha prajatantric naam se apni alag party bana lee
 BJP President Nitin Gadkari has appointed National General Secretary in his new team in view of his political capabilities

 Women make up half of the world's total population, but their number in vocal characters in films is less than one-third
 britain-america ke bich sahyog se banane vaali filmein or bhartiya filmein is silsile main bahut peeche hai
 Showing women sexy in movies has become a standard throughout the film world
 unhen purushon kii tulana main kahin kam kapadon main yaa puri tarah se bina kapadon kii or charhari dikhaaya jaataa he
 In terms of showing women in sexy clothes, India is third after the German and Australian films

 In his petition, a person living in Ahmedabad, using his right to get information, asked the Central Information Commission this peculiar question, but the commission rejected his petition
 yachika khaarij karte hue ayog ne kaha ki is tarah kii suchanaaen maangana yakeenan soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke daayre ko kaaphi lanbaa kheenchna he
 The petitioner sought information about Mahatma Gandhi, some former presidents and other ministers

 However, the first question in the petition was related to the level of 'IQ'

 The Samajwadi Party reached one step closer to the break on Saturday

 After this meeting which lasted one and a half hours, Akhilesh Yadav told these leaders that his father Mulayam Singh Yadav is trusting Amar Singh more than his son
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki jab tak unke uthaae gaye masalon ko hal nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak vah jhukne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Akhilesh Yadav also did not give any assurance that he would participate in the Silver Jubilee Celebration of Samajwadi Party on the 5th to save the honor of the party and father
 aisi bhi khabaren aa rahi hai ki ramgopal yadav bhi 5 november ko ho rahe lakhanu ke janeshwar mishra park main samaajawaadee party kii 25veen saalagirah samaaroh main maujuud nahin rahenge
 Akhilesh Yadav does not want him to share the stage with Amar Singh in front of lakhs of party workers and leaders
 isse pehle in varisht netaaon ne 2 ghante takamulaayam singh yadavase mulaakaat kii thi or unase yah peshkash kii thi ki wo akhilesh se milakar unhen samajhane kii koshish karenge
 The real hope of reconciliation also went away when party state president Shivpal Yadav announced the names of new leaders in the youth wing of the party on Saturday evening
 in youth wing ke sanghathanon ke adhyaksh pehle akhilesh yadav ke kareebi netaa the, jinhen shivpal yadav ne party virdohi gatividhiyon ke aarope main hataa diya tha
 The announcement of new names clearly means that Shivpal Yadav has closed the door for Akhilesh Yadav's favorites
 samaajawaadee partiki kalah us vakt saaf ho gai, jab shanivaar ko ek hi samay par mulaayam singh yadav, shivpal yadav or akhilesh yadav apni-apni alag baithak karne ko majaboor ho gaye
 Mulayam Singh Yadav was sitting with senior leaders at his house to discuss how to celebrate Akhilesh Yadav
 mulaayam singh ko chintaa he ki agar akhilesh 3 taarikh ko apana rath lekar nikal gaye or 5 taarikh ko party ke jalse main lakhanu main nahin rahe, to unki or party kii baari fajihat hogi
 Shivpal Yadav was sitting in the office of the Samajwadi Party at the same time as the state president and was meeting his new executive
 baithak main chetavanee di gai jo log idhar-udhar kaanaafoosee kar rahe hai, unki pahchaan karke unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 At the end of the meeting, the decision came that MLC Udayveer Singh, who wrote a letter to Mulayam Singh Yadav, has been expelled from the party for 6 years
 udhar akhilesh yadav mukhyamantri awaas main apane samarthakon or party se nishkasit un netaaon ke saath baithak kar rahe the, jinhone samaajawaadee party daftar janaa band kar diya he
 Akhilesh's meeting had the same agenda, the chariot of his election campaign on the 3rd, when it comes out, everyone will realize who the party people and people are with
 ravivaar ko akhilesh yadav ne party ke vidhayakon ko apane ghar par bulaayaa he or is baithak par sabaki nigahen lagi hai ki kya akhilesh yadav ravivaar ko hi koi badi ghoshnaa kar denge

 If we talk about many ministers of Bihar in the matter of personal property, then their wives or their dependent families are more wealthy than them

 Rural Affairs Minister Bhim Singh is also seen lagging behind his wife in the matter of ownership of houses
 vaaki in sab aankadon ko dekhakar is soch main padana lajimi ho jaataa he
 How was the veteran politician poorer than his dependents? When Nitish returned to power in November 2010, it was his first decision to declare assets of ministers
 rajg-2 ne aisa hi ek faisla lete hue karmchaaree or adhikariyon ko bhi sampatti kii ghoshnaa karne ko kaha
 Now mlas have also agreed that they will declare their assets every year

 Shahi Nitish Kumar is the wealthiest member of the cabinet
 haalanki paardarshita ke ucch siddhanton ko dhyaan main rakhkar kii gai ghoshnaa ke baavjood, kai tarah ke prashn phir bhi paidaa hote hi hai
 For example, the Minister of Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), Chandra Mohan Roy, does not take any caution when announcing the property
 apni chal sampatti kii ghoshnaa karte hue raay bataate hai ki unke paas 30 gram sone ke aabhushan hai jinaki keemat 90,000 ru
 While his wife owns 800 grams of gold and diamond jewelry
 jinaki keemat lagbhag 3,00,000 ru

 jahaan raay ne apane aabhushanon kii keemat maujuuda bazaar mulya par lagaai he vahiin unki apni patni ke aabhushanon-jo mantri ke aabhushanon se 26 guna zyada he-kii keemat pehle kii ghoshnaa ke mutabik hi he
 There are other announcements too, which cause questions in mind
 jaraa in par najar daalen, to malti singh (gramin kaarymantri bhim singh kii patni) ke paas patna nageshwar colony ke kavi raman path par sthit 1,600 varg foot ke makaan kii keemat 11,10,864 ru
 Has been judged aisa lagata he ki yah keemat kaaphi kam bataai gai he
 This is the colony of Patna where the estimated price of the house is Rs
 4,000
 prati varg foot se kam nahin honi chahie
 The minister may not have taken the current market price into account
 jiske chalate sampatti kii ghoshnaa kaa uddeshy hi bekaar ho gaya he
 In addition, another major drawback of these announcements is the lack of uniformity in the declaration style
 mantriyon ne parisampattiyon kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye apane hi formet kaa chayan kiya he
 Ministers make any improvement in the declaration of their assets in the future, only it will be known that this exercise is indeed bringing some color
 yaa sab sirf apane mutabik chizon ko pesh karne kaa ek tarika bhar he

 ke hai, jo ek tarah se bazaar mulya he
 But his wife's 800 grams of gold and diamond jewelery cost Rs 3,00,000

 Apparently Rai has given different prices for his and wife's gold

 Rural works minister Bhim Singh said the price of a 1,600 sq ft house named after his wife was Rs 11,10,864
 bataai he jo bazaar mulya se kam he
 The house is situated on the poet Raman Path of Patna Nageshwar Colony

 The announcement by Industry and Disaster Management Minister Renu Kumari states that they have house number 101 in Patna's AG Colony

 Sugarcane and Minor Irrigation Minister Awadhesh Prasad Kushwaha valued 60 grams of jewelery at Rs 1,05,000

 It is alleged that MLA Bharti sought a file containing fifteen lakh rupees and asked the ADM to sign it
 jab unhone niyamon kaa hawala diya to vidhayak aag-babula ho gaye or unhone yah elaan kar diya ki file par dastakhat nahin hone tak vah afasar ko uski kursi se nahin hilne denge
 It is alleged that the MLA kept the officer hostage for several hours and misbehaved with him
 ediem ko daraaya-dhamkaaya gaya or unase kai filon par jabaran dastakhat karwaakar vidhayak apane saath le gayi
 The officer signed the files under pressure but at the same time noted that he was doing this order under the pressure of the MLA
 afasar ke mutabik in teen-ghanton main vidhayak ne uske saath bahut bura saluk kiya
 He was very bad and continued to threaten him
 haalanki media ke pahunchate hi vidhayak chalate bane
 The mlas accused in this case were not ready to talk to the media first
 der raat unhone apni safai main kaha ki afasar pichley kai maheene se unka kaam nahin kar rahaa tha or unki filon ko jaanboojhkar latakaakar rakhe hua tha
 It is noteworthy that the officer who has been accused of hanging the job for several months, MLA ji, took charge on this post only on 22 May and soon after that he went on leave for several days

 film 'force-2' kii kahani he mumbai police cop harshavardhan or ro agent keke kii jo ek gaddaar ro agent ko dhundne ke liye mishan par nikalate hai
 This RAW agent has killed three Indian RAW agents in China and threatens the lives of the remaining RAW agents
 harshavardhan yani jon is mishan main isliye shaamil hote hai kyonki china main mare teen main se ek unka sabase acha dost tha or vah marane se pehle jon ko ek klu de jaataa he
 'force - 2' is an action thriller film with tremendous action by John Abraham
 chunki mishan budapest main he isliye vahaan ke sundar najaare film main dekhne ko milenge
 The entire sequence of running and catching on the beach in the middle of thatch is filmed in an excellent way
 sadakon par tej raftaar se daudti bhaagti or peechha karti gadiyon ke drishy bhi achche hai
 The screenplay of the two-hour film is so strict that you will not be bored
 abhinay dev kaa nirdesan bhi thik he
 The comments yah film ection or style se bharpoor to he magar kahani main kuch nayaapan nahin he
 It is a film of spies to say, but spying is less
 jon hon yaa sonakshi, inke paas abhinay ke liye zayaada scope nahin tha
 Yes, Tahir Raj Bhasin has acted well
 yah film ek baat or bataati he ki ro agent jaan-boojhkar apni jaan ko jokhim main daalate hai or desh kii seva karte hai
 But after being caught spying in other countries, the country refuses to recognize them
 kabhi-kabhi to desh drohi kaa thappa bhi laga detaa he
 This message of the film touches the heart, so my rating for 'force-2' is 3 stars
 'force - 2' ek ection thriller film he jisamen jon abraham ne jabardast ection kiya he
 Since the mission is in Budapest, beautiful views will be seen in the film
 is shahar ke bichon-bich chappar par daudane bhaagane or pakadaney ke puure sikvence ko behtareen tareeke se filmaaya gaya he
 The scenes of running and chasing cars running at high speed on the roads are also good
 kareeb do ghante kii film kii patakatha itani sadhi hui he ki aapako bor hone nahin degi
 Abhinay Dev's direction is also fine
 tippaniyan The film is full of action and style but there is nothing new in the story
 kehane ko yah jasuson kii film he magar jasusi hi kam he
 John Hone or Sonakshi did not have much scope for acting
 haa, taahir raaj bhasin ne acchhee acting kii he
 The film tells one more thing that RAW agents willfully risk their lives and serve the country
 magar duusare deshon main jasusi karte hue pakde jane ke baad desh unhen pahchaanane se inkaar kar detaa he
 Sometimes the country also imposes malevolence
 film kaa yah sandesh dil ko choota he isliye 'force-2' ke liye meri reating he 3 star

 During this time, the state administration was completely alert and alert
 pradesh ke 10 jilon main dhara 144 lagaai gai
 The administration monitored through drones

 har naagarik ke liye mere dil kaa dwaar khulaa hua he
 On the other hand, Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said that there should be no injustice to anyone during the bandh
 shantipurna tareeke se virodh pradarshan karne or band karne kaa adhikaar he
 Explain that earlier, Dalit organizations had called 'bharat Bandh' on April 2 in protest against the Supreme Court's decision on SC / ST Act, when the maximum violence took place in Gwalior and Chambal divisions of Madhya Pradesh

 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office, the attitude of the Government of Pakistan is certainly true for India, but the revenge is definitely there
 haalanki donon mulkon ke 'dostana' se pakistani satta main dakhal rakhane vaali vahaan sena khaasi naaraaz he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Pakistan Army has summoned the entire cabinet in its headquarters except the home minister
 yahi nahin, beete kuch samay se sena kaa sarkaar kii policy mekking main bhi dakhal bad gaya he
 The political situation in the neighboring country has become a bit more unstable since the Cabinet meeting at the General Militaryquarter in Ralvalpindi
 sarkaar main sena kaa prabhutv bhi saaf dikh rahaa he
 It is said that in this meeting the policy related to external security and security of the country was discussed

 When they go out of the village they do not forget to wear the cap of AAP

 isi dauraan mohan bhagwat ne raajnneeti main shmashaan or kabristaan aurabhagava aatankwadjise maamalon ke hone par bhi jawaab diya
 In response to this question, he also referred the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Center and the country's main opposition Congress
 bhagwat se sawaal poocha gaya tha ki raajnneeti main shmashaan, kabristaan, bhagava aatankwaad jaise shabdon ko kaise dekhte hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main bhagwat ne kaha ki raajnneeti lokkalyaan ke liye chalani chahie
 He said that the medium of public welfare is power
 agar raajnneetik varg ke log aise chalane lagen to phir shmashaan, kabristaan, bhagava aatankwaad jaisi baaten hongi hi nahin
 He said that all these things happen when politics only runs for power
 jo log raajnneeti main hai unka us tarah kaa prashikshan hone kii jarurat he
 The Sangh chief said that if politics will be for the welfare of the people according to Gandhi and Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan, then the politics of cremation will end
 aapako bataa den ki shmashaan-kabristaan vaala maamla bhartiya janata party ke netaaon kii ore se uthaaya jaataa rahaa he to bhagava aatankwaad ke maamle ko congress uthaati rahi he
 Mohan Bhagwat has given an answer to the Congress and the BJP together, saying that such issues are not in place in the politics of public welfare
 iske saath hi sangh pramukh ne raajnneeti main shaamil na hone or keval bhaajapa ko hi sanghathan mantri dene or bhaajapa ke alaava duusare dalon ko samarthan dene ke sawaal kaa bhi jawaab diya

 abhi tak kisi duusare dal ne sanghathan mantri nahin maange hai
 If asked for from us, we will also consider it, if those parties are doing good work then they will definitely give it
 iske saath hi sangh pramukh ne kaha ki 93 saal mensang ne kisi dal kaa samarthan nahin kiyaahai, sangh keval nitiyon kaa samarthan karata he
 Those who support the policy of the Union take advantage of the power of the Union
 unhone kaha ki jab sangh ke swayamsevak apatkaal ke khilaaf lade to babu jagjivan ram or marxvaadi gopaalan jaise logon kaa bhi samarthan kiya
 After this, the BJP gained due to being in favor of Ram temple

 The mob neither considered it appropriate to call the police nor hand over the accused minor to the police
 bina jurm sabit hue hi bheed ne insaaf karne ke naam par peet peet kar ladke kii hatya kar di
 In this case, the police have also caught a minor boy including the landlord Mukesh, Ram Chandra, Vishal, Ram Dhyan, Rajkumar

 Opportunity to get job in NCELT for many posts including assistant, 1091 vacancies for government posts, 524 vacancies anjaan or adrishy takaton kii khoj karne vaale indian paranormal sosayadi ke sansthaapak gaurav tiwari ne khudakushi kii thi
 Delhi Police say that Gaurav's death is not an unusual incident
 dilli police is maamle kii vaigyanik tareeke se jaanch kar rahi he
 Gaurav died of suffocation, Delhi Police has also denied Gaurav's theory of murder at present, although the police also say that once the final postmortem report is received, the whole puzzle will be solved
 dilli police kii maane toindian paranormal sosayadi ke gaurav tiwariki maut paranormal nahin he, balki gaurav ne khudakushi kii he
 The police are still awaiting the final postmortem report
 vaise jo shuruuaati postmortem report saamne ai he uske mutabik gaurav kii maut dam ghutane se hui he
 According to Gaurav's Lashpulis, hanging in the bathroom, he got the news of Gaurav's death when the family took Gaurav to the hospital
 ghar waalon ne police ko bataaya kii 7 july kii subah kareeb 11 baje achaanak bathroom se kuch girane kii aawaaj ai
 At this, when Gaurav's father and wife ran towards the bathroom, they found that the bathroom door was locked from inside
 kaaphi peetane par bhi jab darwaja nahin khulaa or naa hi gaurav kii koi aawaaj ai, tab duusari taraf se bathroom kii jaali khol kar wo andar daakhil hue
 Gaurav's neck was tied around his neck and his other end was tied to the latch on the bathroom ceiling
 khudakushi maanane kii hai kai vajahagaurav kii maut ko paranormal maanane kii bajaae khudakushi maanane kii police ke paas kai vajah hai
 Like -1
 bathroom kaa darwaja andar se band tha, jiskaa matlab he ki gaurav ne khud darwaja band kiya tha
 2
 gaurav kii laash fande se jhul rahi thi
 3
 ghar main gaurav ke maa-baap or patni ke alaava koi or nahin tha
 4
 gaurav ke gale ke alaava chot ke kahin or nishaan nahin mili or gale par nishaan fanda kasne kii vajah se he
 The forensic team went to Gaurav's house for investigation
 Now apparently Gaurav's death has come to know from the family members of Gaurav because Gaurav's housemates took his body to the hospital even before the police was informed
 lihaaja bathroom kaa sach or gaurav ke ghar waalon ke bayaan kii tasadeeq ke liye mangalvaar ko forensik or doctoron kii ek team gaurav ke ghar gai thi
 To find out whether Gaurav died in the bathroom or not
 rishton ke pench main funskar di gaurav ne jaan?dilli police ne doctoron se postmortem report jaldi dene kii guzarish kii he, taaki gaurav kii maut kii paheli zyada der tak naa uljhi rahe
 The postmortem report will reveal the reason for Gaurav's death, but the question is why Gaurav committed suicide
 bakaul police gaurav ne rishton ke pench main funs kar apni jaan de di, haalanki shaadi se pehle jis ladki ke saath gaurav ke rishte kii baat saamne aa rahi he usne aaj tak se baatcheet main gaurav ke saath apane saath rishton ko kori afvaah bataaya he
 Gauravadilli police had met friends a day before the death, during the investigation, it was found out that Gaurav had a relationship with a girl attached to the Indian Paranormal Society before marriage
 magar phir kisi vajah se donon ke rishte tut gaye, jiske baad gaurav ne isi saal farvari main shaadi kar lee
 On the night of July 6, the day before his death, Gaurav met many of his friends, one of whom was a girl
 chah july kii shaam saadhe saat baje gaurav ghar se dilli ke ek honted place kii tafteesh karne gaya tha or raat dedh baje ghar lautaa tha
 Gaurav and his old friend met only between seven and half in the evening at half past one
 ghar lautakar gaurav kii hui patni se ladayeeder se ghar lautne par us raat gaurav kii apni patni se jhagada bhi hua tha
 In fact, Gaurav often quarreled with his wife because of his late return home
 jhagade ke baad gaurav ne gusse main apana mobile diwaar par de maaraa tha
 That night, the police are also accepting that there is a fight between the husband and wife
 is bich 'aaj tak' ne us ladki se bhi baat karne kii koshish kii, jiske saath gaurav ke rishte kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 Although he refused to speak on camera
 ladki ne kaha gaurav ke saath rishte kii baat he afvaahus ladki ne kaha, 'sori, main philhal gaurav kii maut par kuch nahin kahana chaahati
 The family of Gaurav himself is still silent on this matter
 gaurav kii shaadi se pehle yaa shaadi ke baad mere or gaurav ke rishton ke bare main jo bhi baaten kahi ja rahi hai, wo sab kori afvaah he
 There is no truth in it
 plis in afvaahon par yakeen mat kijiega
 i request you that my name will not be dragged in these rumors
 agar mujhe lagegaa ki aapse kuch share karnaa chahie, to main jarur aapako bataaungi
 'gaurav's phones and laptops are being investigated, so to know the reason of Gaurav's death, the police is also investigating Gaurav's relationships
 police kaa kahana he ki use media ke jariye hi gaurav ke rishton ke bare main jaankaree mili he
 The family members never said anything like this
 dilli police ke sutron ke mutabik bahut mumkin he ki gaurav rishton kii vajah se hi pareshaan tha or isiilie usne khudakushi kii ho kyonki ab tak kii tafteesh main aisi koi or vajah saamne nahin ai he, jisaki vajah se gaurav jaan detaa
 The police are also interrogating the rest of his colleagues of the Indian Paranormal Society, who work with Gaurav in this regard, and are also investigating Gaurav's phone and laptop

 After some time, when asked about Basu's remarks, he again reiterated, "yes, i still believe that it was historical error, because such occasions do not come again
" itihaas aise avasar doharaata nahin he
 He said that the United Front had offered him to become Prime Minister knowing that he was a Marxist and Communist because he did not see any other person for the post of Prime Minister

 november: chuttee nahindisambar: 1 disambar- id (shuukravaar), 25 - christmas (somvaar) Onamkeral is an important festival but its popularity remains in other states as well
 yah vaarshik tyohaar 15 agast ko shuru hua tha or 27 agast ko khatm hoga
 This time the Onamke festival has lost its sheen due to the devastating floods in Kerala
 is tyohaar kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki is din log mandiron aadi main puja-archana nahin karte, ghar main hi puja karte hai
 In the context of this festival, it is said that there was an Asura king named Mahabali in Kerala, in whose honor people celebrate the festival of Onam
 log isefasalaur upaj ke liye bhi manaate hai
 Onam is celebrated for ten days
 is dauraan sarp nauka daud ke saath kathakali nrity or gaanaa bhi hota he
 In the month of Shravan, this is seen in every part of India, but in Kerala, the weather becomes very pleasant in this month
 fasal pakane kii khushi main logon ke man main ek nai umang, nai aashaa or nayaa vishwaas jaagrit hota he
 In this happiness, Lord Shravan and Goddess of flowers are worshiped in every house
 kerala main olym kaa tyohaar badi dhoomdhaam se manaaya jaataa he
 Just as Ramlilaas are held ten days before in Dussehra, in the same way ten days before Onam, the program of decorating the houses with flowers goes on
 olym har saal shravan shukla kii trayodashi ko manaaya jaataa he
 Flowers are made in the house, ten days before the festival of Onam in Gharkerel, its preparations begin
 har ghar main ek phool-grih banaaya jaataa he or kamare ko saaf karke isamen golakaar rup main phool sajaae jate hai
 On the first eight days of this festival, floral decoration is organized 
 nauven din har ghar main bhagwaan vishnu kii murti banaai jaati he
 They are worshiped and the women of the family play dance applause around it
 raat ko ganeshji or shravan devtaa kii murti banaai jaati he
 Children sing songs of worship of Vamana avatar
 murtiyon ke saamne mangaladeep jalaae jate hai
 The idol immersion is done after the puja-archana
 olym ke dauraan banate hai lajij vyanjanbhojan ko kadli ke patton main parosa jaataa he
 Apart from this, 'pachadi-pachadi Kallam, Ollam, Dawa, Ghee, Sambar' are also made
 papad or kele ke chips banaae jate hai
 Milk pudding has special importance
 darasal ye sabhi paak vyanjan 'nimboodiri' brahmanon kii paak–kala kii shreshthata ko darshaate hai tathaa unki samskruti ke vistaar main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 It is said that eighteen types of milk dishes are made in Kerala
 inamen kai prakaar kii daalen jaise mung va chanaa ke aate kaa prayog bhi vibhinn vyanjanon main kiya jaataa he
 Ancient traditions-1
 kerala main manaae jane vaala yah tyohaar hast nakshatra se shuru hokar shravan nakshatra tak chalata he
 On this ten-day festival, people draw pictures with different flowers on a triangular statue of Mahabali clay in the courtyard of the house
 pratham din phulon se jitne golakaar vrut banaai jaati hai dasven din tak uske dasven gune tak golakaar main phulon ke vrut rache jate hai
 It is believed that on the third day of Thiruvonam, the Mahabalis return to Hades
 jitani bhi kalakritiyaan banaai jaati hai, ve mahabali ke chale ke baad hi hataai jaati hai
 This festival is associated with Keralites as an old tradition
 olym vaastavik rup main fasal kaatane kaa tyohaar he jisaki vyapak manyata he
 2
 kaha jaataa he ki jab parashuramji ne sari prithvi ko kshatriyon se jeet kar brahmanon ko daan kar di thi
 Then there was no place for them to stay, then they did the penance of water god Varuna sitting in the cave of Sahyadri mountain
 varun devtaa ne tapasya se khush hokar parashuram ji ko darshan die or kaha ki tum apana farsa samudr main phenko
 As far as your ax will go into the sea, the sea water will dry up and become earth
 vah sab prithvi tumhaari hi hogi or uskaa naam parashu kshetra hoga
 Parshuram ji did the same and the land he got in the sea, the present is called 'kerala or Malayalam'
 parashuram ji ne samudr se bhoomi praapt karke vahaan par ek vishnu bhagwaan kaa mandir banwaaya tha
 The same temple is still famous as 'tirukkara Appan'
 jis din parashuram ji ne mandir main murti sthapit kii thi, us din shravan shukla kii triyodashi thi
 Hence the festival of 'onam' is celebrated on that day
 is parv kii lokapriyata kaaphi zyada he
 This is the reason why the Government of Kerala celebrates Onam as a tourist festival
 is dauraan kerala kii saanskrithik dharohar dekhte hi banati he
 On the occasion of Onam, the whole of Kerala comes alive with programs such as boat competition, dance, music, Mahabhoja etc
 yah tyohaar keralavaasiyon ke jivan ke saundarya ko saharsha angikaar karne kaa pratik he
 This festival is one of the most colorful festivals in India

 congress kii nai mahasachiv priyanka wadra ke liye 6 farvari kaa din behad ahm rahaa
 On this day, Priyanka faced a situation in which she again proved why her entry into the Congress on the ventilator has brought new life
 darasal buudhvaar ko pati priyanka wadra ko idi daftar tak chhodane ain priyanka gandhi ne ye saaf massej de diya ki wo kal bhi robert wadra ke saath khadi thim, aaj bhi saath khadi hai or aage bhi robert wadra ke saath khadi rahengi
 In such a situation, it is also necessary to mention those statements of the past in which Priyanka Vadra has been answering questions raised on her husband Robert Vadra
 inamen pati robert wadra kaa bachaav karnaa bhi shaamil he or narendra modi ko jawaab dena bhi
 In the case of Robert Vadra, Priyanka Gandhi, who was never on the backfoot, will become a burden in the political career of Vadra's political career
 jis tarah priyanka wadra apane pati ke saath idi ke daftar main pahunchin, usase unka massej clear ho gaya ki apane pati par lag rahe aaropon par wo baikfoot par nahin khelengi
 By the way, Priyanka Vadra has never been on the backfoot in the case of Robert Vadra before
 jab ‘damaad ji’ kahkar modi karte the warsawl 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle prachaar joro par tha
 Modi used to refer to Robert Vadra as 'son-in-law' in almost all his speeches and accused the Congress family of benefiting him and promoting corruption
 usee dauraan america akhbaar washington post main jab robert wadra ko lekar khulaasa chapa to narendra modi ne chhattisgarh ke vishrampur main 20 april ko ek raily ke dauraan chutki lee thi
 Modi said in a sarcastic tone that the young man who had studied till class 10, who had Rs 1 lakh in his pocket, had Rs 300 crore in three years
 aisa jaadugar? ye maa-bete kaa kaarobaar he
 This is their model
 tu-ji kaa to suna tha
 Now i have also heard of brother-in-law
 priyanka kaa jawaab- jitna jaleel karenge utana majboot hongethik usee vakt priyanka gandhi wadra raibareli main sonia gandhi ke liye chunaav prachaar kar rahi thim
 In it, Priyanka Gandhi responded to Narendra Modi's attack on Robert Vadra
 22 april 2014 ko priyanka gandhi ne jansabha main kaha ki bahut baaten hoti hai
 Hard things
 mere parivaar ko jaleel karnaa, mere pati ke bare main bahut baaten kahi jaati hai
 i feel sad dukh is baat kaa nahin he ki aap kisi ko jaleel kar rahe ho or sachai aage nahin aa rahi he
 i explain to my children that one day the truth came out
 maine indira ji se siikhaa tha
 When the intention of the heart is correct, a shield is formed, inside the chest
 jitna jaleel karte hai, ye kavach utana majboot banataa he
 Modi told the RSVP that the new model was the first time Priyanka Gandhi had publicly given clarification on the allegations leveled against her husband
 tab narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri se desh ke pradhanmantri banane kii taiyaari kar rahe the or reliyon main robert wadra kaa naam le lekar congress ko gher rahe the
 During the campaign, Modi said that our country was also run by RSVP
 pehle RSVP arthshaastra main hua karata tha
 Now the model of RSVP has come
 r yani rahul
 s means Sonia
 v yani wadra
 p means Priyanka
 ba se bas bhi karienarendra modi ne jab RSVP vaale hamale main wadra kaa naam shaamil kiya tha to priyanka ko jaraa bhi acha nahin laga tha
 In his next rally, Priyanka Vadra replied to Modi
 tab priyanka ne kaha ki kabhi ABCD, kabhi RSVP
 Sometimes country from de
 kabhi k se kaua
 Oh, just do it from b too
 aap kisi praathmik paathshaala ko to sambodhit nahin kar rahe hai
 Priyanka Vadra has always been at the forefront of defending SP Robert's return Thebert Vadra

 Robert Vadra's name was not included in the list of spg-protected people, but at the instance of former SPG chiefs and Delhi Police
 hamaare parivaar ne kabhi is tarah kii suvidha nahin maangi thi
 It should be removed immediately
