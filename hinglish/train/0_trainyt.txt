 It is indeed good news that Liberty Cinema, which has been a part of Mumbai's glorious history, is going to start again with Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj's film 'ek Thi Dion'

 Liberty Cinema, which could provide less business as compared to other famous cinemas in South Mumbai, closed a year ago
 haalanki pichley ek saal se filmon kaa pradarshan na kar rahe liberty cinema main film ke music lonch parties or anya chote mote samaaroh hote rahete hai
 This is the reason why the beauty of this cinema has been preserved even today through renovation

 If the glorious history of Liberty Cinema, which is going to start with Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj's 'ek Thi Dion', is repeated once again, do not be surprised at it, rather it will be considered as the majesty of the witches

 Richards said i like Virat's aggressive style

 ’unhone viraat kii aakraamakata kii or apane khilaadiyon kaa bachaav karne ke liye prashansa kii
 Richards said, 'as someone who wants to see' class' not batting, i like his (virat's) aggression as a captain
 vah har maukey par apane khilaadiyon kaa bachaav karegaa or mujhe isamen koi bhi buraai nahin dikhti
 ' sar richards ne yahaan kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki is tarah kii safalataa ke baad kohli or team ke liye aglaa str videshon main austrailia or england kaa saamana karnaa he
 If you can do the same as you have performed here, then the Indian team will join the 'great teams'
 ’ 121 test match khilne vaale is anbhavi cricketer ne bharat kii australia ke khilaaf siries ko sabase kathin siries main se ek qaraar diya
 He praised the team's consistency and Kohli's captaincy going forward, saying, "the recent home season has been very good, they have set an unbeatable record

 Tehseen Poonawala did this in retaliation after Hegde's statement in which he said that Hindu girls should not touch his hands
 asal main, anant hegade ne kaha tha ki agar koi shaks hindu ladki kaa haath choota he to uske haath bachane nahin chahie
 We need to think again about our society's priorities
 unhone kaha, 'ek shaks jo hindu ladakiyon ko chhue, uske haath bachane nahin chahie

 Anant Hegde's statement is getting a lot of criticism in the social media world
 isi kram main tahseen poonawala ne unhen chalange kar diya
 My marriage is holy, do not drag me Anant Hegde also got involved with Congress leader Dinesh Gunddu Rao in Karnataka on Monday
 unhone apane pratidwandvi congress netaa dinesh gunddu raav par unki patni ko lekar vyaktigat tippanee kar di
 The BJP leader said that i know Dinesh Gunddu Rao as someone who ran after a Muslim woman
 is par palatwaar karte hue dinesh gunddu raav ne kaha, 'yah dukhad he ki vah (anant hegade) is tarah kii tippanee kar rahe hai
 This is the standard of people in high positions in this government
 ve hameshaa bhadakaau bhashaa kaa istemaal karte hai
 Perhaps people in his party ask him to do so

 Nobody is invincible in electoral politics, not even the self-proclaimed Bahubali and the politician Chanakya
 phir bhi modi-shah ke jodi kii aisi abha rahi jo pichley chaar saal se har chunaav main vipaksh ko paraajay kii bhaavana or haar kii anivaaryta se jakadte hue dikhi
 Politics is a game of chess, often played in the mind like a campaign
 isiilie in chunaavon ke nattejey aakhirkaar vipaksh ko aatmavishvaas denge ki koi bhi aparaajey nahin he, yahaan tak ki madhya pradesh main hui kaante kii ladaai main bhi nahin, jahaan yah ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki bijepi kaa behatar sanghathan kisi tarah use nuksaan se bachaane main sakasham hoga

 congress isiu se baahar aa gai he lekin phir se khadey hone kii sthiti se abhi dur he
 If the Congress sees the victory in three states as a complete revival of the party, it would be a big mistake
 party ab chaar rajyon main sarkaar bana rahi he, jabaki bijepi kaa camel desh ke 16 rajyon main ab bhi tair rahaa he
 The Congress's resentment in Rajasthan and not being able to take full advantage of the exhaustion of the government of the same party thrice in Madhya Pradesh is a sign of the party's weak organization, which still lacks the art of delivering knockout punch on a favorable pitch
 akaaran hui jeet punarutthan nahin he balki ek pareshaan sena ke liye ek raahat he
 If this victory creates complacency of an 'all is well', as it may be, then the Congress may need to be awakened once again: If it still does not wake up, look at Chhattisgarh leader Bhupesh Baghel who Showed what it takes to fight a street battle 24x7; Even Kamal Nath who gave some form to the organization scattered in MP, or Sachin Pilot who got the chance to get out of the trap of Lutyens Delhi

 The BJP is slowly losing its grip in the Hindi belt
 saal 2014 main bijepi kii lahar ne uttar bharat ke rajyon ko goa ke pashchimi tat se uttar ke himanchal pradesh tak rajya dar rajya apane kabje main le liya tha
 In the Hindi belt area alone, the party won an unprecedented 192 out of 210 seats, setting the stage for a clear majority in Parliament
 rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh kii 65 main se 62 siten jeetin: yadi 11 disambar ke nateezon jaisi hi sthiti rahi to yah sankhya kam se kam aadhi ho jaaegi
 Even if we assume that the general elections are different from the states' bouts, the fact remains that the wave has stopped: unlike Gujarat where bjp's vote share increased last year, in these three states of the Hindi belt The party's vote share has declined
 yah ek ashubh sanket he, khaas taur par aisi sthiti main jab bijepi ko agle saal upi main espi-bispi gathbandhan jaise sambhavit chunauteepurn pratidwandviyon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa

 voter ke mahatv ko kabhi kam na samajhen
 People will describe the results of December 2018 as the 'poor' who seek to overcome the bright light of the big cities as the vengeance of Sikar or Saguja '
 lekin chunaav ke nattejey aksar jatil hote hai: udhaaharan ke taur par bijepi ne gramin madhya pradesh ke bade bhaag par apni pakad banaae rakhi he, paramparaagat sarvan jati kaa samarthan kho detii he phir bhi kor obisi vot par pakad banaae rakhti he, shaayad is tathy kii pushti karata he ki 'kisaan putr' shivaraj singh chouhan ne apni saakh barkaraar rakhi he
 In Rajasthan too, the regional gap was more than the deep moat of cities and villages, while in Chhattisgarh, the party suffered in the entire state
 exis maai india pole dikhaata he ki party kaa janajaatiy, dalit, yuva or kisaan majdoor vot gata he, yah is baat kaa sanket he ki kam aay vaale samooh kaa mohabhang hua he
 This was not merely an anti-demonetisation election, but a result of the triple strike: in which rising oil prices, agrarian crisis and lack of employment opportunities have put BJP on the backfoot
 yah ek tarah se aam aadmi, cheharaavihin bhartiya kaa pratishodh he jiskaa aakhri hathiyaar vot he

 We thought that the anti-incumbency wave was the cruel rule of Indian politics; We believed that the public hated the family's governance and allegations of corruption; We were told that freebies are bad not only for the economy but also for politics; We used to think that the vote bank is divided on the basis of caste and religion

 The 'pink Tsunami' of Telangana reminds us that regional leaders do not follow traditional wisdom but form their own rules

 Chandrashekhar Rao made a big gamble of holding elections early
 unhone vaada kiya tha ki ve sabhi ko galat sabit karenge
 He was right: the work of public interest in KCR style for all sections of society and the rising wave of Telangana sub nationalism was enough for the Telangana Rashtra Samithi

 There were elections in Mizoram too
 raajnneetik rup se prabhaavshaalee hindi pattee ke kolahal main, ham lagbhag bhul gaye ki mizoram bhi bhartiya sangh kaa abhinn ang he
 Aizawl's results are no less important: the Northeast is truly 'congress-free' and its 25 Lok Sabha seats will prove to be important next year
 vijeta bhi vah vyakti he jo hamaare loktantric aavegon ke liye thos sabak pradaan karata he
 The Mizo National Front in its earlier incarnation was a militant separatist organization

 Rahul Gandhi has arrived as a politician
 rahul gandhi kaa raajnneetik 'aagaman' ek antaheen pratiksha kaa khel rahaa: na bhoolen ki unhone apni raajnneetik shuruyaat 14 saal pehle kii thi
 During this time, Mr
 Gandhi started doing politics in and out, sometimes his surname became his only identity
 bhale hi ve ek saal pehle hi congress ke adhyaksh bane hon, lekin yah ek loktantric chunaav se zyada unka rajtilak tha
 And when he has attained the post, he is yet to earn the respect of party workers
 is chunaav ke faisle ne kuch had tak unki hameshaa haarane vaali chhavi ko badal diya: mistar gandhi ko ab congress ke saamaanya jan is tarah se dekhenge jo badi jeet dilaa saktaa he
 More importantly, by being aggressively leading, showing conviction and consistency in his messages, he has removed the fear of modi-shah's chariot from the mind of the average Congress worker
 wo abhi bhi pragati par ho sakate hai, unamem abhi bhi trutiyon kii sambhaavna ho sakati he, ho saktaa he ki wo ab bhi jahaan hai vahaan sirf vanshavaad ke siddhant ke aadhaar par hon, lekin unke sabase bade aalochak bhi ab maanenge ki rahul gandhi ke netritv ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa

 gandhi or hindutv rashtrawaad se pare, modi-shah ko nae nerrative kii jarurat he
 In 2014, Modi was the contender, an anti-incumbent hero who has come to eliminate old raiyats
 yah role ek '56 inch' bahubali tikhaa bolne vaale jananetaa ke unke vyaktitv ko suut karata he: wo lagaataar har muddon par manmohan singh kii upie sarkaar par hamalaa kar sakate the
 Amit Shah also had a role as a strategist - a master of hard work who can organize the BJP organization into a ruthless political engine
 donon netaaon ko ab khud ko pun: pesh karne kii jarurat he
 Modi's new India cannot be merely a slogan, it needs to provide a meaningful alternative to governance
 vibhaajankaree mandir abhiyaan ko punerjeevit karnaa or yogi adityanath ke aakraamak upyog or hindutv kii raajnneeti kaa dhruvikaran karne kaa unka brands, kya bataata he? pradhanmantri dilli kii sadakon par viechpi ke pradarshnakariyon dwaara jama masjid giraane kii dhamkee bhare naaron par khamosh kyon he? or aakhir is baat ko sweekaar karne kii anichhaa kyon he ki ho saktaa he ki notebandi achche iraadon se kii gai ho, lekin manamaane dhang se uthaaya gaya yah kadam bahut galat rahaa, jisane lakhon gairsandigdh logon ko prabhavit kiya or chote dhandhon ko khatm kar diya? 22 karod pariwaron ko sarkaar ke kaarykram kaa laabh mila, jaisi hedline hi kaaphi nahin hai; un pariwaron ke jivan main vitaran pranali ke jariye dikhne vaale badlaav kii jarurat he
 When the Prime Minister mentioned Christian Mitchell and namdar-kamdar at a rally in Dausa, Rajasthan, it did not touch the audience who wanted assurance that their next year's crop would not be lost in the business-bureaucratic nexus
 amit shah ko bhi mahasoos karnaa padegaa ki raajnneetik pratidwandita sirf gandhi parivaar par hamalaa karnaa yaa phir kaalpanik shatru paidaa karnaa jaise ki bangladeshi ghuspaithiye, yaa phir pados main maujuud muslim parivaar, se zyada hota he
 The flag bearers of change have to present a positive agenda of trust and optimism
 aisa naa ho ki ve sirf nakaaratmakataa or sampradayawad kaa dhindhora hi peetate rahen
 The best way to stay in power for a long time is to be less arrogant and more polite

 The 2019 race has started and the BJP is still at the forefront of this race
 in chunaav ke nateezon se in tathyon par phir se muhar laga di he ki bhale hi bijepi kaa nerrative phisalata ja rahaa ho, ellection mashin abhi bhi kadai se bijepi ke haathon main he, phir chaahe wo vittiya sansaadhan ho, yaa phir jameen ke sipaahi
 The Congress may be slowly learning from Amit Shah's Electoral School for booth management, social media management and contact with the people standing on the last queue, but the Congress still has neither the money nor the people who belong to the Sangh Parivar Work like dedicated activists
 bijepi kii haar se ye cader agle saal naye josh ke saath kaam karne aa sakate hai
 The defeat of 'mahakutami' in Telangana has also exposed the boundaries of the opposition's coalition politics
 jahaan par kamyaabi ke liye aankadon ke ganit ko jameen par maujuud sameekaran kaa saath milanaa jaruri he
 In this way, the door that can prove to be the gate of Congress in the south is now seen to be closed
 iske ulat bijepi bhale hi haari ho, lekin abhi out nahin hui he
 Modi can hope that the same voters who rejected the BJP in the state elections will support the party in the general election
 yahaan par rajasthan kaa ye naaraa nahin bhuulaa janaa chahie, 'modi tujhse vair nahin, vasundhara teri khayr nahin
 "now it is certain that the BJP is going to change the 2019 contest into 'who is against Modi'?" yahaan par vipaksh ke liye mukhya chunauti deshbhar main 543 siton par rashtriya chunaav ko sthaneey main badalanaa he, jahaan par muddon ko lekar bahes hoti he naa ki shakhsiyat ko ahmiyat di jaati he

 media hameshaa apane aap main massej nahin hota he
 In the last four years, one thing that has been a constant companion of the BJP is that the media, especially TV news, remained its cheerleaders
 is desh ke itihaas main isse pehle kabhi bhi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par media itani gairalochanatmak nahin rahi; isse pehle kabhi bhi ek shaks / party ko itnaa prime time spes mila; isse pehle media kabhi nahin apane naitik daayitv se is kadar vimukh rahaa
 BJP lost despite media playing the role of Team shah-modi's 12th player; It has a message for all of us: it is public, everyone knows it
 matadaataaon ne apni galati sudhaar lee he
 When will we do it so that the contest is on par in 2019? During the Gujarat elections last December, an enthusiastic anchor borrowed a dialogue of the Dawn film and said, "it is impossible not to defeat Modi Shah
 " chaliye acha he ye ek doylaag he jo disambar 2019 ke liye zyada maujuun he: "wo sinkadar hi dosto kehalaata he
 
 
 As much as anyone knows who loses

 Charges were framed in this case on Swami Aasimanand, who was arrested in November 2010

 After the fodder scam case involving Deoghar Koshaghar, Lalu has now been convicted in another case related to Chaibasa
 lalu ke alaava kul 12 logon ko is maamle main doshi paaya gaya he
 Lalu has been sentenced to 5 years in this case
 ab sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya lalu raajnneetik sakriyata ke apane vakt main kabhi jail se baahar aa sakenge?darasal, ye puraa cese janvari 1996 main saamne aayaa
 After which 6 separate cases were filed against Lalu Yadav
 maamla patna hai court tak pahunchaa, jisane sibiai ko ghotaale kii jaanch ke aadesh die
 On September 30, 2013, the special CBI court convicted Lalu Yadav in the first case related to Chaibasa Koshaghar, sentencing 5 years in the first case
 unhen paanch saal jail kii sajaa sunai gai
 This case is of embezzlement of Rs 37 crores
 jail ke saath un par 25 lakh rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya tha
 Lalu remained in Ranchi's Birsa Munda jail and got bail in December 2013 and came out of jail
 duusare cese main saadhe 3 saal kii sajaachaara ghotaalaa se jude devgarh koshaghar cese main lalu yadav ko 23 disambar ranchi kii vishesh sibiai adaalat ne doshi mana, jiske baad unhen jail bhej diya gaya

 isamen se ab tak kareeb 1 saal do maheene lalu jail main guzaar chuke hai
 That is, in three cases only, Lalu will have to remain in jail for more than 12 years as per the decision of Ranchi special CBI court
 agar, lalu ko ucch adaalat se raahat nahin milti he, to lalu prasad yadav 2019 to dur 2024 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi shaayad hi janata ke bich ja saken
 Lalu Yadav, the next born of independence to the country, is at that stage of age who is moving towards retirement in terms of political activism
 isse bada sankat ye he ki kul 900 karod ke chaara ghotaale main lalu ke khilaaf abhi teen or maamle lambit hai
 On the other hand, getting bail for Lalu, who has been convicted in three cases, is also considered as a legal challenge
 aise main 69 saal ke ho chuke lalu kii sakriyata ab 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav, 2020 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav or uske baad 2024 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dekhne ko mili, ise lekar ashankaayen hai

 digvajay singh ne kaha ki bharat main keval ramdev hi keval deshbhakt nahin he
 Digvijay Singh has given this response to the statements made by Baba Ramdev about corruption and black money
 isse pehle congress ke is varisht netaa ne hi somvaar ko kaha tha ki baba ramdev ko apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa kerani chahie
 After this, the sages of Haridwar also said that Ramdev must declare his wealth
 mangalvaar se sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he or isse do din pehle congress ne sarkaar ko ultimatum de diya he
 Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said that running the Parliament is not the responsibility of the opposition parties but it is the responsibility of the government
 sarkaar agar chaahati he ki satr sucharu rup se chale, to sarkaar ke paas 24 se 48 ghante hai, lekin is bich congress ne sushamaa swaraj ko lekar narmi ke sanket bhi die hai
 In Parliament, the Congress will not directly target Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj nor will it follow any strategy like boycotting her
 rajya sabha main netaa vipaksh or congress ke mahasachiv ghulaam nabi azaad ne sushamaa ko sansad main gherne ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki ye kisi vyakti vishesh kaa maamla nahin he
 The party will not encircle any of the Union ministers, mps, Chief Ministers or mlas surrounded in this matter, but will raise this whole issue vigorously
 thodi der baad puche gaye ek duusare sawaal ke jawaab main azaad ne lalitget main ghire vasundhara raaje or vyaapman main ghire shivaraj singh chouhan kaa naam lekar istife kii maang kii
 It is clear that the Congress's position on Sushma Swaraj has softened
 lalitget ke khulaase ke shuruaati dinon main congress sushamaa ko lekar bahut hamalavar thi
 In every press conference she used to demand the resignation of Sushma Swaraj along with Vasundhara Raje
 baad main wo puri tarah se vasundhara ko gherne main jute gai
 Now that the monsoon session of Parliament is beginning, one way for the Congress as the main opposition party was to boycott Sushma Swaraj as foreign minister
 jab bhi wo bolne ko uthen yaa videsh mantralay se jude kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene ko hon, congress sadan se uth kar chali jaae yaa unako sunne ko taiyaar na ho
 But according to the indications from the Congress, she is not going to do so
 congress ke rukh main aae badlaav ke peeche ek badi vajah ye he ki congress ke saath khadi rahi kai vipakshi partiyon kaa rukh sushamaa ko lekar naram he
 It also includes RJD-JDU, with which she is going to contest elections in Bihar
 iske alaava samaajawaadee party bhi sidhe sushamaa par istife ke liye dabaav banane ke paksh main nahin he
 Sushma is considered an anti-modi group within the BJP
 aise main akalan ye he ki sushamaa agar vipakshi hamale kii shikaar hoti hai, to modi ko or khulaa maidan milegaa
 While Modi feels pressure on him to ask Sushma to resign or remove him from the post of the Ministry of External Affairs, it will give air to their mutual rivalry
 lekin ranneeti sushamaa ko banaae rakh kar modi ko gherne kii he
 The comments modi kii captaini par sawaal uthaane kii he
 In much the same way, despite giving a certificate of honesty to Manmohan Singh, the BJP, as the opposition party, kept on issues like 2G because they are the head of the government and they have the ultimate responsibility
 somvaar ko sarvadaleey baithak hone vaali he
 In this meeting, the Congress will try to read the words of all the small and big opposition parties
 uske baad usee hisaab se sansad main apni ranneeti tay karegi
 In the initial days, there is every possibility of a loud ruckus, but how much to chant and to what extent the Congress does not want to adopt the policy of Ekla Chalo as a chaos
 ye zarur he ki mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par modi sarkaar or bijepi se sabase majbooti se loha lete hue dikhnaa chaahegi
 If the government wants the session to go smoothly, then the government has 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime, the Congress has also indicated softness regarding Sushma Swaraj
 sansad main congress bhartiya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko sidhe nishane par nahin legi or na hi unako boycott karne jaisi kisi ranneeti par chalegi
 In the Rajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition and Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad, in response to a question about Sushma being surrounded in the Parliament, said without mentioning that it was not a matter of any particular person
 party is maamle main ghire kisi ek kendriya mantri, saansad, mukhyamantri yaa vidhayak ko nahin gheregi balki is puure mudde ko zorshor se uthaaegi
 In response to a second question asked a little later, Azad demanded his resignation after naming Vasundhara Raje in Lalitgate and Shivraj Singh Chauhan surrounded by Vyapam
 isse saaf he ki sushamaa swaraj ko lekar congress kaa rukh naram hua he
 In the early days of Lalitgate's revelations, the Congress was very aggressive about Sushma
 har press kafrence main wo vasundhara raaje ke saath-saath sushamaa swaraj ke istife kii maang bhi karti thi
 Later, she completely engulfed Vasundhara
 ab jab ki sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he, mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par congress ke liye ek tareeqa ye bhi tha ki videsh mantri ke taur par sushamaa swaraj kaa boycott kiya jaae
 Whenever he wakes up to speak or has to answer any question related to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Congress should leave the House or he is not ready to listen
 lekin congress kii taraf se mil rahe sanketon ke mutabiq, wo aisa nahin karne ja rahi
 a big reason behind the change in the attitude of the Congress is that many opposition parties standing with the Congress are soft on Sushma
 isamen argedy-jediu bhi shaamil he, jiske saath wo bihar main mil kar chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 Apart from this, the Samajwadi Party is also not directly in favor of pressuring Sushma for resignation
 sushamaa ko bijepi ke bheetar modi virdohi kheme kaa mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the assessment is that if Sushma is the victim of opposition attack, Modi will get more open ground
 jabaki modi apane upar dabaav mahasoos kar sushamaa se istife ke liye kehete hai yaa unhen videsh mantralay ke pad se hataate hai to isse unki aapasi ranjish ko hawa milegi
 But the strategy is to surround Modi by retaining Sushma
 tippaniyan Modi's captaincy has to be questioned
 kuch-kuch vaise hi jaise manmohan singh ko eemaandaaree kaa certificate dene ke baavjood vipakshi party ke taur par bijepi 2ji jaise muddon par isliye gherti rahi ki ve sarkaar ke mukhiya hai or antim zimmedaari unki banati he
 An all-party meeting is scheduled to take place on Monday
 congress is baithak main tamaam choti badi vipakshi partiyon ke ravayai ko padhane kii koshish karegi
 After that, it will decide its strategy in Parliament accordingly
 shuruaati dinon main to zordaar hangaamaa hone kii puri sambhaavna he, lekin kis mudde ko kitna tool den or kis had tak jaaen congress is maamle main aflatoon ban kar ekala chalo kii niti nahin apnaanaa chaahati
 It is sure that as the main opposition party, Modi would like to appear to be taking the iron out of the government and BJP most strongly
 rajya sabha main netaa vipaksh or congress ke mahasachiv ghulaam nabi azaad ne sushamaa ko sansad main gherne ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki ye kisi vyakti vishesh kaa maamla nahin he
 The party will not encircle any of the Union ministers, mps, Chief Ministers or mlas surrounded in this matter, but will raise this whole issue vigorously
 thodi der baad puche gaye ek duusare sawaal ke jawaab main azaad ne lalitget main ghire vasundhara raaje or vyaapman main ghire shivaraj singh chouhan kaa naam lekar istife kii maang kii
 It is clear that the Congress's position on Sushma Swaraj has softened
 lalitget ke khulaase ke shuruaati dinon main congress sushamaa ko lekar bahut hamalavar thi
 In every press conference she used to demand the resignation of Sushma Swaraj along with Vasundhara Raje
 baad main wo puri tarah se vasundhara ko gherne main jute gai
 Now that the monsoon session of Parliament is beginning, one way for the Congress as the main opposition party was to boycott Sushma Swaraj as foreign minister
 jab bhi wo bolne ko uthen yaa videsh mantralay se jude kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene ko hon, congress sadan se uth kar chali jaae yaa unako sunne ko taiyaar na ho
 But according to the indications from the Congress, she is not going to do so
 congress ke rukh main aae badlaav ke peeche ek badi vajah ye he ki congress ke saath khadi rahi kai vipakshi partiyon kaa rukh sushamaa ko lekar naram he
 It also includes RJD-JDU, with which she is going to contest elections in Bihar
 iske alaava samaajawaadee party bhi sidhe sushamaa par istife ke liye dabaav banane ke paksh main nahin he
 Sushma is considered an anti-modi group within the BJP
 aise main akalan ye he ki sushamaa agar vipakshi hamale kii shikaar hoti hai, to modi ko or khulaa maidan milegaa
 While Modi feels pressure on him to ask Sushma to resign or remove him from the post of the Ministry of External Affairs, it will give air to their mutual rivalry
 lekin ranneeti sushamaa ko banaae rakh kar modi ko gherne kii he
 The comments modi kii captaini par sawaal uthaane kii he
 In much the same way, despite giving a certificate of honesty to Manmohan Singh, the BJP, as the opposition party, kept on issues like 2G because they are the head of the government and they have the ultimate responsibility
 somvaar ko sarvadaleey baithak hone vaali he
 In this meeting, the Congress will try to read the words of all the small and big opposition parties
 uske baad usee hisaab se sansad main apni ranneeti tay karegi
 In the initial days, there is every possibility of a loud ruckus, but how much to chant and to what extent the Congress does not want to adopt the policy of Ekla Chalo as a chaos
 ye zarur he ki mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par modi sarkaar or bijepi se sabase majbooti se loha lete hue dikhnaa chaahegi
 In response to a second question asked a little later, Azad demanded his resignation after naming Vasundhara Raje in Lalitgate and Shivraj Singh Chauhan surrounded by Vyapam
 isse saaf he ki sushamaa swaraj ko lekar congress kaa rukh naram hua he
 In the early days of Lalitgate's revelations, the Congress was very aggressive about Sushma
 har press kafrence main wo vasundhara raaje ke saath-saath sushamaa swaraj ke istife kii maang bhi karti thi
 Later, she completely engulfed Vasundhara
 ab jab ki sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he, mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par congress ke liye ek tareeqa ye bhi tha ki videsh mantri ke taur par sushamaa swaraj kaa boycott kiya jaae
 Whenever he wakes up to speak or has to answer any question related to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Congress should leave the House or he is not ready to listen
 lekin congress kii taraf se mil rahe sanketon ke mutabiq, wo aisa nahin karne ja rahi
 a big reason behind the change in the attitude of the Congress is that many opposition parties standing with the Congress are soft on Sushma
 isamen argedy-jediu bhi shaamil he, jiske saath wo bihar main mil kar chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 Apart from this, the Samajwadi Party is also not directly in favor of pressuring Sushma for resignation
 sushamaa ko bijepi ke bheetar modi virdohi kheme kaa mana jaataa he

 Watch the trailer here: bijepi ko satta ke shunya se shikhar tak pahunchane vaale purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne party main netaaon kii puri ek peedi taiyaar kii
 This is the reason that today BJP is in power in more than 20 states along with the Center
 pradhanmantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad se har bade maukey par or apane bhaashanon main narendra modi kabhi atal bihari vaajapeyi ko yaad karnaa nahin bhoolatey
 Click here to pay homage to Atalji
 Actually, both the leaders have a long association
 wo atal bihari vaajapeyi hi the, jinke faisle se narendra modi aaj satta ke shikhar tak kaa rasta tay kar paane main safal hue hai
 In the 1995 elections in Gujarat, the BJP formed an absolute majority government
 shankar singh waghela or narendra modi ko darkinar kar keshubhai patel ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 After this Narendra Modi was called to Delhi to see the work of the party
 1998 main gujarat main madhyavadhi chunaav hue or ek baar phir bijepi kii satta main vaapasi ho gai
 But the central leadership kept Modi still in Delhi and Keshubhai Patel was again given the responsibility of CM

 According to media reports, in October 2001, Narendra Modi went to a funeral in Delhi
 usee vakt unke paas pradhanmantri nivas se phone aayaa or aakar milane ke liye kaha gaya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee then asked Modi to leave Delhi and leave from here
 tab modi ne poocha ki iskaa kya matlab he
 Then later Vajpayee's whole thing was explained to Modi
 jisamen unhen bataaya gaya ki vaajapeyi unhen (modi) gujarat kaa mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai, isliye unhen dilli chhod gujarat jane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the NDA was in power at the Center and Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister
 us din vaajapeyi se mulaakaat ke baad narendra modi gujarat main mukhyamantri banane ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 After which in 2002, 2007 and 2012 also he became the CM of Gujarat and in 2014 got the chance to take the chair of the Prime Minister of the country

 shridevi ke nidhan ko lekar soshal media par phans se lekar tamaam netaaon or abhinaytaon ne twit kar apana dukh jaahir kiya
 Meanwhile, many superstars also shared their sweet relationship and memories with Sridevi, but there was no response from Bollywood star Salman about this big tragedy of Bollywood
 ab tak salmaan kii ore se shridevi kii maut ko lekar naa hi koi bayaan saamne aayaa or naa hi koi twit yaa post
 What would have been the reason for this? LIVE: Reports have been made about Sridevi, every eye Namaskar Sridevi and Salman, wrapped in a tricolor in a truck decorated with white flowers, that the bonding of these two stars was very good
 ek dfa shridevi ne intervyuu main is baat zikr kiya tha ki unke khud ke baad or unki betiyon ke baad unki jindagi main kisi cheez kaa unhen pishan he to wo he painting
 Salman is one of those who gifted a painting made by Sridevi himself
 yahaan tak ki ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki wo salmaan hi the jinhone shridevi ko painting karne ke liye protsaahit kiya tha
 Click here to pay tribute to Sridevi
 
 
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki shridevi ke itane kareeb hone ke baavjood bhi salmaan kaa koi riection nahin aayaa
 The answer is that Salman has been seen tweeting less about his personal relationships earlier
 salmaan ke personal spes main shridevi kii ahm jagah thi
 There are some experiences that cannot be shared with everyone
 salmaan ne bhi shridevi ke nidhan ke dukh ko sirf unke parivaar waalon ke saath hi baantne chaha
 Let me tell you that Salman had also reached Anil Kapoor's house to pay tribute to Sridevi
 LIVE: antim yatra par bollywood kii 'chandani', trek par maujuud hai arjuna-boni kapoorsalmaan akasar shridevi ke kaam kii tarif karte aae hai
 Even when Sridevi was awarded the Star of the Millenium award at the Zee Cine Awards, Salman said while announcing the award- 'I, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar and Shah Rukh Khan did many films in their careers Will be

 'kitne din main bazaar main aata he nakli yphone?lajpat raay market ke khudara vikreta in nakli smartphone ko gharelu bazaar se lekar videshon tak main bech rahe hai
 When Apple launched its latest iphone-11, which is priced from 64 thousand 900 to 141 thousand 900, it would not have been imagined that in less than a month its fake version would be in Delhi at a lower price

 dilli main pichley dinon hue gangrape ke babat die gaye bayaan ko lekar vivaadit or dharmaguru hone kaa daawa karne vaale asaram baapu ne buudhvaar ko media par thikra phodte hue kaha ki unke bayaan ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya gaya
 Asaram, who attended the Mahakumbh, also announced that he would give Rs 50 lakh as a reward if someone proves that he had also attributed the victim to the gangrape
 gauratlab he ki asaram ne pichley dinon kaha tha ki yadi 23 saal kii peedita ne doshiyon ke saamne raham kii guhaar lagaayi hoti or unase yah kaha hota ki vah to unki bahan kii tarah he to vah apni izzat or jaan bachaa sakati thi

" ’ Ever ready to merge his party RLD into JDU with Nitish Kumar, Chaudhary Ajit Singh is yet to open his cards about where he will stand in the 2017 UP Assembly elections
 sutron kii maane to choudhary har taraf haath aajamaa rahe hai
 Along with JDU, BJP is also in touch, and is also talking to Congress
 lekin ab kahin bhi baat ab tak bani nahin he
 According to sources, Chaudhary went to 10 Janpath last week to meet Sonia Gandhi, but could not be reached when Chaudhary was given a Rajya Sabha seat
 choudhary ne sonia se rajyasabha seat chaahi to sonia ne sochoongi kahkar koi aashwaasan nahin diya
 Unhappy with this, Chaudhary did not make any statement to the media after the meeting, instead deciding to keep the meeting secret so that there would be an opportunity to deal elsewhere
 bijepi se bhi ab tak mila jhatkaudhar, choudhary sonia se mili or sochaa ki ab unki mol-tol kii takat bad jaaegi lekin sonia se mulaakaat kii bhanak lagate hi bijepi ne ek kadam aage badhaate hue saaf kar diya ki, choudhary bijepi jwine karen, unki party se samjhaute par wo raji nahin
 Anyway, bjp's Sanjeev Balyan leader from western Uttar Pradesh is strongly opposed to taking Chaudhary along
 unka maananaa he ki jat hindu ke taur par bijepi ke saath hai hi or akele hone par choudhary ke paas muslim jat sameekaran rahegaa nahin
 In such a situation, Chaudhary is seen getting entangled in his own woven web
 rajyasabha seat kii darkaar or bete kaa bhavishyadrasal, loksabhaa chunaav main choudhary kii party ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 Chaudhary himself and his son Jayant also lost the election
 apane pita choudhary charan singh ke jamaane se lutian jone main mili kothi bhi khaali kerani pad gai
 Moved away from Parliament politics
 ab vidhansabha main itani siten nahin ki rajyasabha kii ek seat bhi mil sake, isiilie choudhary dar-dar bhatak rahe hai
 Chaudhary's second problem is the future of his son Jayant Chaudhary
 choudhary ke salaahkaaron kaa maananaa he ki aaj bhale hi pashchimi upi main party ke paksh main dangon ke chalate maahaul na ho, lekinparty kaa base vot jat or muslimhai, vahi aane vaale vakt main party ko dobaaraa khadaa karegaa
 In such a situation, the party should not go with the BJP in view of the future
 sapa or basapa se bhi nahin bani batsapa ko choudhary zyada mufeed lage nahin kyonki usko lagata he ki aaj ke vakt jat-muslim sameekaran choudhary ke haq main nahin he or muslim aise main muslim sapa ke saath rah saktaa he, lekin choudhary ke saath jane par muslim khisak saktaa he
 That is why he declared all his Rajya Sabha seats
 vahiin basapa kaa bhi maananaa he ki, choudhary ke saath jane kii bajaay wo dalit muslim sameekaran kaa phayda le sakati he
 Overall, Chaudhary is currently standing in the lurch
 lekin kisi bhi vakt karavat badalane main maahir choudhary kii agali karavat kis taraf hogi, ye shaayad khud choudhary bhi nahin jaanate, kyonki is baar wo apane sabase bure siyaasi vakt se guzar rahe hai

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Gandhian Anna Hazare, who is running a mass movement against corruption, said on Thursday that he does not see any difference between the BJP and the Congress to eradicate this evil
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh milakar unhen badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Hazare said in an eight-page two-letter letter to Congress leader Digvijay Singh, written to him on October 11 and 12, that both parties (congress and BJP) do not have the voice of their own to eradicate corruption, both to eradicate corruption
 i do not see any difference in parties
 sangh se swayan ko jode jane ke digvijay ke aaropon par unhone kaha, aapane mujhe bhaajapa or sangh parivaar se jodne kaa prayaas kiya he
 You either will not know or you are becoming ignorant even by knowing

 Neither appeared in my movement
 unhone kaha, agar bhagwat ne kaha ho ki anna ke andolan main ham sahabhaagi the to jaise aapaki party (congress) mujhe badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahi he, vaise hi aresas bhi meri badanaami kii koshish kar rahi he, aisa main maanata hum
 Either of you must have tried to slander me together
 hazaare ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki kya aapaki party, kya bhaajapa or kya aresas, koi meri kitni bhi badanaami kii koshish kare, satya hameshaa satya hota he
 The Gandhian activist said that the people of the country have nothing to do with BJP, Congress or RSS
 janata bhrashtachar se pareshaan he, bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii koshish jab tak aap or aapaki party kii sarkaar nahin karegi, tab tak in juthi baton kaa janata par koi asar nahin hoga
 Your big leaders have experienced this
 sangh kii ore se unhen likhe gayi patron ke aadhaar par unka sangh parivaar se rishta jode jane ke digvijay ke daavon par hazaare ne kaha, hamaare andolan ko shikast dene ke liye aap aresas ke suresh bhaiya kaa patr janata ko dikhaa rahe hai, aise patr kaa saboot aap bana rahe hai
 
 
 The proof may be that when i have replied to such a letter
 
 
 aisa koi patr he to saboot ho saktaa he
 He said, for the good of society and country for 30 years, i have been facing slander and have prepared to bear slander even further
 jis ped par fal hote hai, usee ped par log pathar maarthe hai, is baat ko main acchhee tarah jaanata hum
 Hazare advised Digvijay that the color of his glasses to see his movement is wrong and that he should change the glasses
 bhaajapa dwaara unhen raashtrapati pad kaa aglaa ummidavaar banaaye jane ke sabjbag dikhaane ke digvijay ke daawey par hazaare ne kaha, naa to raashtrapati banane kii meri paatrata he or na hi dil main raashtrapati banane kii meri ichha

 At the same time, the central government said in the court that many suggestions and objections have been received from the state governments regarding these rules which are being considered

 After this, the central government will change the rules and issue notifications again

 The central government told the court that it would take three months for states to identify markets for animals
 centre agast ke aakhir tak niyamon main badlaav karegi
 Till then the rules of this notification will not apply
 darasal supreme court ne pashu bazaar main vadh ke liye maweshiyon ko kharidne or bachane par roak lagane vaali adhisuchana ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par centre ko notice jari kiya tha
 The petitioner, a resident of Hyderabad, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court, stating that the notification of the Center is 'discriminatory and unconstitutional' as it violates the rights of cattle traders
 yachikakarta mohammad fahim kuraishi ne pashu krurta rokthaam (jabt pashuon kii dekhbhaal tathaa ilaaj) kanoon, 2017 ko bhi chunauti di he
 Faheem Qureshi, a lawyer by profession, has contended that the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (cattle Market Regulation) Act, 2017 and the Prevention of Animal Cruelty (care and Treatment of Seized Animals) Act, 2017 are arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional
 yachikakarta ne 23 may ko jari donon adhisuchanaaon ke vibhinn praavdhaanon ko chunauti di he
 Faheem Qureshi has questioned the rule that under-age cattle cannot be sold in the market until the buyer submits an affidavit stating that he is a farmer, the cattle will be used only for agricultural purposes
 And it will not be sold for six months
 bataa den ki centre sarkaar ke is notification kaa kerala samet desh ke kai rajyon main virodh kiya gaya he

 The Supreme Court said that when the Central Government issues the notification again, enough time should be given to the people
 vahiin, centre sarkaar ne court main kaha ki in niyamon ko lekar rajya sarkaron se kai suzav or aapatti jataai he jin par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The Central Government is not currently implementing the rules and it will take about three months to make changes in them
 iske baad centre sarkaar niyamon main badlaav kar dobaaraa notification jari karegi
 The comments supreme court ne sari yachikaaon kaa nipataara kiya or kaha ki jab nae niyam banenge to koi bhi court main chunauti de saktaa he
 The petition filed against the notification issued by the central government for selling and buying animals for slaughter, was put forward
 centre sarkaar ne court main bataaya ki rajyon ko pashuon ke liye bazaaron kii pahchaan karne main teen maheene kaa vakt lagegaa
 The center will change the rules by the end of August
 tab tak is notification ke niyam lagu nahin honge
 In fact, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the Center on a petition challenging the notification prohibiting the purchase and escape of cattle for slaughter in the animal market
 hyderabad nivasee yachikakarta ne ucchtam nyaayalay main yachika daayar kii thi or kaha tha ki centre kaa notification ‘bhedbhaav purna or asanvaidhanik’ he kyonki yah maveshi vyapaariyon ke adhikaron kaa hanan karata he

 The petitioner has challenged the various provisions of both notifications issued on 23 May
 fahim kuraishi ne us niyam par sawaal uthaaya he, jisamen kam umr ke maweshiyon ko tab tak bazaar main nahin bechaa ja saktaa, jabatak ki kharidaar ek halafanama bhare, jisamen vah bataae ki vah ek kisaan he, maveshi kaa keval krishi uddeshyon ke liye istemaal hoga or use chah maheenon tak nahin bechaa jayega
 Explain that this notification of the Central Government has been opposed in many states of the country including Kerala
 kerala main to vidhansabha ke ek divasiy vishesh satr main hissaa lene se pehle vidhayakon ne naashte main gomance kaa seven kar virodh jataayaa tha
 At the same time, the central government said in the court that many suggestions and objections have been received from the state governments regarding these rules which are being considered

 aspx Deepa Karmakar has made history by qualifying as the first Indian woman gymnast in the Olympics
 lekin bharat ko final main entry dilaane ke liye unhen apni jindagi ko daanv par lagaana padaa
 The feat he performed to secure the place is called Produnova, which was done by Russian gymnast Elena Produnova in the year 1999
 isamen aage ek handspring or do somarsolts hote hai
 It is considered one of the most difficult gymnastics
 deepa kii uplabdhiyaan9 agast ko 23 varsh kii huin deepa nirbhayata or kamyaabi kii misaal hai
 Since 2007, Deepa has won 77 medals at the state and international level, including 67 gold

 The Wall Street Journal reported that the game of death was described by Produnova as a game of death by the Wall Street Journal, because whenever a gymnast performs it, there is a risk of being crippled as well as likely to be killed
 ek choti si galati bhi kisi khilaadi kaa puraa kariyar tabah kar sakati he
 American gymnast Simon Biles says that one can die by performing it and Deepa also knows this
 lekin yah khatra deepa ke hausale ke aage bahut chota he
 This feat is so difficult that till date only five people have been able to perform it
 biles kaa mahila jimnast shrenee ke itihaas main sabase zyada gold jeetne kaa record he
 But despite this, he decided not to do Produnova, which gives him a special edge
 jab america jimnast lori hairnadez se practice ke baad prodoonova ke bare main poocha gaya to unki coach ne kaha, shukriya, magar ham ise nahin karenge
 In other words, Biles said, "I am not trying to die, not a friend of my life, just look at the Olympic medal
 But according to reports, Deepa has performed this feat 1000 times in the last three months in the Olympic practice
" jis kartab koethlite olympicsmein parform karne se ghabaraate hai, use deepa rojaanaa kar rahi hai
 This is what sets them apart from others
 olympic khel tab aae jab practice ke liye teen maheenon kaa vakt tha
 Despite this, he secured a Rio Olympics ticket in the last moments
 vishwa pratiyogitaaon main paanchave sthaan par rahane ke baad deepa rio ke liye daawa pesh nahin kar pain thim
 But he was sent by the Gymnast Federation of India for the test event which was his last chance to qualify for Rio
 unhone is maukey kaa bharpoor phayda uthaate hue event main gold medal hasil kiya

 Stephen Hawking, one of the world's greatest scientists, passed away
 unhone apane jivan main spes-time ko lekar kai shodh kiye
 He has explained many theories, including Bing Bang Theory and Black Hole Theory, etc
 unki jindagi par aadhaarit ek film 'da thiari of avarithing' bhi relies hui thi
 Let's know about some of his research
 
 
 singularity kaa siddhant (1970)-oinstin ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant bhi singularity ke bare main bataate hai
 However, during Hawking's research, it was found that the Big Bang is actually the inversion of a black hole
 jaane- kya he big baing theory? stephen ne bataaya kaise bani thi duniyablike hole kaa siddhant (1971-74)-stephen hawking ne blike hole ko lekar kai shodh kiye
 According to their first theory, the total surface area of a black hole will never be small
 ek anya siddhant ke anusaar blike hole garm hota he
 Cosmic Inflation Theory (1982) - This theory was given in the year 1980 by Alan Guth
 baad main unhone bataaya ki padaarth ke vitaran main kam badlaav hota he arthath inflation ke dauraan yah brahmad main akashgangaon ke prasar ko janm de saktaa he
 None of Stefan's body used to work except for the mind, which was because Universe's model on wave function (1983) —stephen Hawking was interested in establishing a quantum theory of gravity, but with James Hartley, he worked with Hartley in 1983 — Hawking State model was published
 yah siddhant kahata he ki samay mahavisphot se pehle maujuud nahin tha or isliye brahmad kii shuruyaat kii avadharana arthhin he
 top-down Theory (2006) -hawking says that the universe has a gravitational force, so it can create new creations and does not need the help of a god like that
 jab bhi ham yah sunate padhate hai ki padhai hindi yaa maatrubhaasha main hoti he, ham dar kyon jate hai
 Are people in our country not studying in mother tongue? agar aap sarkari skulon kaa vistaar dekhenge or garibon kii shiksha tak pahunch kaa moolyankan karenge to abhi hi karodon bachche apni apni matra bhashaa main shiksha main grahan kar rahe hai
 In the same Delhi city, there are 12 Bengali medium schools and 13 Urdu medium schools
 sankhya bhale na paryaapt ho magar hindi, angrezi ke alaava is shahar main kannada, telugu, bangla or urdu ke skool chalate hai
 This is why i am studying in India in the mother tongue
 inaki sthiti kya he, yah ek alag se charchaa kaa vishay he
 Now you will be asked whether you would like to teach your child in Indian language mediums or in English medium school, what would be your answer
 bagair kisi whatsap ke prabhaav main aae is sawaal kaa jawaab dijiega
 Will you be ready to send your child from Hindi medium school to Hindi medium or Bangla medium
 yah sawaal meraa he na ki kisi sarkaar ne bheja he
 On 8 October 2015, Times of India Reema Nagarajan reported that in 2008-09, only two of Delhi's 9 districts outnumbered English medium students in Hindi medium students
 paanch saal ke bheetar puri dilli main ye sthiti palat jaati he
 In 2013-14, the number of English medium students in six districts exceeded the Hindi medium students
 paanch saal ke bheetar hindi madhyam chaatro kii sankhya main 1 lakh chalis hazaar kii kami aa gai
 Meaning people have increased towards English medium schools
 kya logon ne apane bacchon ko english medium main isliye daalaa kyonki hindi medium skool karaab the yaa phir angrezi kii zarurat ke kaaran ve hindi yaa maatrubhaasha se dur gaye
 It is also a fact that there is an advocacy for teaching in the mother tongue throughout the world
 vidwaan ise shreshth maanate rahete hai
 In Friday's Indian Express, Ashutosh Bhardwaj's news that the Education Culture Uplift Trust, associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has proposed to the Ministry of Human Resources to end the English imperative at all levels
 sabhi skulon main kaksha paanch tak maatrubhaasha anivaary ho
 a language university should be established in every state in which management, engineering, medical studies should be conducted in that language
 iaiti or im aadi angrezi madhyamon ke sansthaanon main bhi bhartiya bhashaaon main adhyayan karne kii avilamb suvidhaayen di jaaen
 No compulsory option of foreign languages should be given in schools at any stage
 tribhaasha niti kii samiksha kar nai bhashaa niti par vichaar ho
 Dinanath Batra is the head of the Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas
 isi saal agast main iconomik times kii praachi verma kii ek report chhapi he ki angrezi madhyam ke kaaran kai chaatr pehle hi saal main fail ho ja rahe hai or unhen santhaan se nikaal diya ja rahaa he
 About 1 percent of the students in six iits are fired in the first year due to English
 iaiti kanpur ke 3000 chaatro main se 30 chaatro ko nikaala gaya
 Out of 850 IIT Delhi students, 12 were fired
 pratishat ke hisaab se to bhashaa ke kaaran nikaale gaye chaatro kii sankhya to kam he lekin itane bade santhaan se koi angrezi ke kaaran baahar ho jaae to uski bhashaa hi nahin saamaajik prishthbhumi bhi dekhni chahie
 You are aware that the Ministry of Human Resources is advising on the new education policy
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ne sirf suzav diye hai
 It has not yet become the policy of the government
 yah spasht rahanaa chahie
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has told BJP sources that we cannot take the country back
 dakshin bhartiya rajyon ke bhi sawaal hai
 India is competing globally
 aise main angrezi ke bina kaam nahin chalata he
 The Internet has become a global village
 angrezi vaishvik bhashaa he
 With the coming of the Modi government in 2014, there was a certain kind of activism about Hindi and Sanskrit, but so far the government has not done anything concrete on such a large scale that it seems that it is going to finish English and encourage Hindi or Indian languages
 bhashaa ke sawaal par to bijepi camere par baat kar sakati thi magar yah zaruri nahin he ki sutron ko har samay camera acha hi lage
 In 2005, the Yashpal Committee stated in the National Curriculum Framework that the medium of instruction in schools should be the language spoken at home
 yashpal cameti ne madar tang se pehle home language or first language kaa istemaal kiya he
 The committee had said that schools must provide education in home language at the primary level
 tippaniyan The Yashpal Committee has not rejected the importance of English
 uske vikalp ko sweekaar kiya he lekin shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas kii tarah angrezi kii anivaaryta ko samaapt karne kii baat nahin kii he
 The 2005 National Curriculum Framework states that the level of starting English is political, not an academic or utility issue
 angreji ko karikulam yani paathyacharchaa main kis str se padhaayaa jaae is bare main janata kii raay kaa aadar karnaa hoga, is aashwaasan ke saath ki ham us tantra ko or adhik neeche na le jaaen jo fail rahaa he
 Apart from this, the institution associated with the RSS suggests that every university adopts ten villages and educational institutions adopt a township or village
 pradhanmantri ne bhi saansadon se kaha he ki ve adarsh gram yojana ke tahat gaanv god len
 If all the villages are adopted, what will the other agencies do
 panchayat se lekar zile kii agencia kya aisa nahin kar paa rahi hai jiske kaaran gaanvon ko god diya ja rahaa he
 There is another issue on this again separately, but there is another issue in the suggestion that research should be published in more and more Indian languages
 angrezi main prakashit shodh kaa ek bhartiya bhashaa main anuwaad anivaary ho
 Research work should be linked to national needs
 shodh ko rashtriya aavashyaktaa se kaise joda jayega
 We will also discuss this
 kya kavita yaa kahani main hone vaale shodh ko rashtriya aavashyaktaa maanenge, research main rashtriya aavashyaktaa kaise feet karenge, kya koi rashtriya aavashyaktaa ayog hoga, kya is vakt zaruri vishyon par shodh nahin hote hai
 It is very important to underline that by saying that at this time all universities, especially in the states, also have phds on unsolicited topics
 baharhaal kya aap angrezi kii anivaaryta se mukti paane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Let me again say that it has been suggested, the government has not taken any decision
 ab aapse poocha jaae ki aap apane bachche ko bhartiya bhashaa madhyamon main padhaanaa chahenge yaa angrezi madhyam ke skool main to aapkaa jawaab kya hoga
 Will answer this question without any whatsapp effect
 kya aap apane bachche ko angrezi madhyam skool se naam kataakar hindi madhyam main yaa bangla madhyam main bhejne ke liye taiyaar honge
 This question is mine and not from any government
 8 oktober 2015 ko times of india kii rima nagarajan kii report chhapi thi ki 2008-09 main dilli ke 9 zilon main se sirf do zilon main angrezi madhyam chaatro kii sankhya hindi madhyam chaatro se adhik thi
 This situation reverberates throughout Delhi within five years
 2013-14 main chah zilon main angrezi madhyam ke chaatro kii sankhya hindi madhyam ke chaatro se adhik ho gai
 Within five years, the number of Hindi medium students decreased by 1 lakh forty thousand
 matlab english medium skulon kii taraf logon kaa rujhaan badha he
 Did people put their children in English medium because Hindi medium schools were bad or did they move away from Hindi or mother tongue due to need of English
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki duniya bhar main maatrubhaasha main shiksha dene kii vakaalat hoti rahati he
 Scholars continue to consider it superior
 shuukravaar ke indian express main ashutosh bharadwaj kii khabar chhapi ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke saamne prastaav rakhaa he ki sabhi str par se angrezi kii anivaaryta samaapt kii jaae
 Mother tongue should be compulsory till class five in all schools
 har rajya main us bhashaa kaa vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya jaae jisamen prabandhan, ejineering, medical kii padhai vahaan kii bhashaa main ho
 Immediate facilities for studying in Indian languages should also be provided in English medium institutions like iits and iims
 vidyalayon main kisi bhi str par videshi bhashaaon kaa anivaary vikalp na diya jaae
 The new language policy should be considered after reviewing the trilingual policy
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ke pramukh deenanath batra hai
 In August this year, a report by Prachi Verma of the Economic Times published that many students are failing in the first year due to English medium and they are being expelled from the institute
 chah iaiti main kareeb 1 pratishat chaatr pehle varsh main angrezi ke kaaran nikaal diye jate hai
 Out of 3000 students of IIT Kanpur, 30 students were fired
 iaiti dilli ke 850 chaatro main se 12 ko nikaala gaya
 According to the percentage, the number of students fired due to language is less, but if someone goes out of such a large institution due to English, then his language and social background should also be seen
 aap jaanate hai ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay nai shiksha niti par salaah mashwara kar rahaa he
 Education Culture Upliftment Trust has only given suggestions
 wo abhi sarkaar kii niti nahin bani he
 It should remain clear
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne bijepi ke sutron se bataaya he ki ham desh ko peeche nahin le ja sakate hai
 South Indian states also have questions
 bharat vaishvik str par muqabla kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, no work is done without English
 internet kii vajah se global village ban gaya he
 English is a global language
 2014 main modi sarkaar aane ke saath hindi or sanskrit ko lekar ek khaas kism kii sakriyata dikhi lekin abhi tak sarkaar ne vyapak str par aisa kuch thos nahin kiya he jisase lage ki wo angrezi samaapt kar hindi yaa bhartiya bhashaaon ko protsaahit karne ja rahi he
 On the question of language, the BJP could talk on camera, but it is not necessary that the sources always like the camera
 2005 main yashpal cameti ne neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha tha ki skulon main shiksha kaa madhyam ghar main boli jane vaali bhashaa hi ho
 The Yashpal Committee has used Home Language and First Language before Mother Tong
 cameti ne kaha tha ki skool praathmik str par home language main zarur shiksha den
 The comments yashpal cameti ne angrezi ke mahatv ko khaarij nahin kiya he
 Accepted its option but did not talk of ending the imperative of English like Education Culture Upliftment Trust
 2005 ke neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha gaya he ki angrezi shuru karne ke str kaa maamla raajnneetik he, naa ki iske peeche koi academik yaa upyogita kaa mudda he
 Public opinion has to be respected at which level English should be taught in curriculum, with the assurance that we do not take the system further down which is failing
 iske alaava aresas se judi sanstha kaa suzav he ki har vishvavidhyalay das gaavon ko god le or shikshan sansthaaen ek basti yaa gaanv god len
 The Prime Minister has also asked mps to adopt villages under the Adarsh gram Yojana
 saare gaanv god le liye jaaenge to baaki agenciyaan kya karengi
 Panchayat to district agencies are not able to do this due to which villages are being adopted
 is par phir kabhi alag se lekin ek or mudda he is suzav patr main ki shodh kaa prakaashan adhik se adhik bhartiya bhashaaon main ho
 Translation of research published in English into an Indian language is mandatory
 shodh kaary ko rashtriya aavashwayakataaon se joda jaae
 How will research be linked to national need
 ham is par bhi baat karenge
 Will the research in poetry or story be considered as a national necessity, how will it fit the national need in research, will there be a National Requirements Commission, is there no research on the necessary topics at this time
 yah kehete hue is baat ko rekhaankit karnaa bahut zaruri he ki is vakt tamaam vishvavidhyalayon main khaskar rajyon main anaap shanaap vishyon par bhi piechdi hoti he
 However, are you ready to get rid of the inevitability of English
 phir se kah den ki ye suzav diya gaya he, sarkaar ne koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Meaning people have increased towards English medium schools
 kya logon ne apane bacchon ko english medium main isliye daalaa kyonki hindi medium skool karaab the yaa phir angrezi kii zarurat ke kaaran ve hindi yaa maatrubhaasha se dur gaye
 It is also a fact that there is an advocacy for teaching in the mother tongue throughout the world

 Dinanath Batra is the head of the Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas
 isi saal agast main iconomik times kii praachi verma kii ek report chhapi he ki angrezi madhyam ke kaaran kai chaatr pehle hi saal main fail ho ja rahe hai or unhen santhaan se nikaal diya ja rahaa he
 About 1 percent of the students in six iits are fired in the first year due to English
 iaiti kanpur ke 3000 chaatro main se 30 chaatro ko nikaala gaya
 Out of 850 IIT Delhi students, 12 were fired
 pratishat ke hisaab se to bhashaa ke kaaran nikaale gaye chaatro kii sankhya to kam he lekin itane bade santhaan se koi angrezi ke kaaran baahar ho jaae to uski bhashaa hi nahin saamaajik prishthbhumi bhi dekhni chahie
 You are aware that the Ministry of Human Resources is advising on the new education policy
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ne sirf suzav diye hai
 It has not yet become the policy of the government
 yah spasht rahanaa chahie
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has told BJP sources that we cannot take the country back
 dakshin bhartiya rajyon ke bhi sawaal hai
 India is competing globally
 aise main angrezi ke bina kaam nahin chalata he
 The Internet has become a global village
 angrezi vaishvik bhashaa he
 With the coming of the Modi government in 2014, there was a certain kind of activism about Hindi and Sanskrit, but so far the government has not done anything concrete on such a large scale that it seems that it is going to finish English and encourage Hindi or Indian languages
 bhashaa ke sawaal par to bijepi camere par baat kar sakati thi magar yah zaruri nahin he ki sutron ko har samay camera acha hi lage
 In 2005, the Yashpal Committee stated in the National Curriculum Framework that the medium of instruction in schools should be the language spoken at home
 yashpal cameti ne madar tang se pehle home language or first language kaa istemaal kiya he
 The committee had said that schools must provide education in home language at the primary level
 tippaniyan The Yashpal Committee has not rejected the importance of English
 uske vikalp ko sweekaar kiya he lekin shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas kii tarah angrezi kii anivaaryta ko samaapt karne kii baat nahin kii he
 The 2005 National Curriculum Framework states that the level of starting English is political, not an academic or utility issue
 angreji ko karikulam yani paathyacharchaa main kis str se padhaayaa jaae is bare main janata kii raay kaa aadar karnaa hoga, is aashwaasan ke saath ki ham us tantra ko or adhik neeche na le jaaen jo fail rahaa he
 Apart from this, the institution associated with the RSS suggests that every university adopts ten villages and educational institutions adopt a township or village
 pradhanmantri ne bhi saansadon se kaha he ki ve adarsh gram yojana ke tahat gaanv god len
 If all the villages are adopted, what will the other agencies do
 panchayat se lekar zile kii agencia kya aisa nahin kar paa rahi hai jiske kaaran gaanvon ko god diya ja rahaa he
 There is another issue on this again separately, but there is another issue in the suggestion that research should be published in more and more Indian languages
 angrezi main prakashit shodh kaa ek bhartiya bhashaa main anuwaad anivaary ho
 Research work should be linked to national needs
 shodh ko rashtriya aavashyaktaa se kaise joda jayega
 We will also discuss this
 kya kavita yaa kahani main hone vaale shodh ko rashtriya aavashyaktaa maanenge, research main rashtriya aavashyaktaa kaise feet karenge, kya koi rashtriya aavashyaktaa ayog hoga, kya is vakt zaruri vishyon par shodh nahin hote hai
 It is very important to underline that by saying that at this time all universities, especially in the states, also have phds on unsolicited topics
 baharhaal kya aap angrezi kii anivaaryta se mukti paane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Let me again say that it has been suggested, the government has not taken any decision
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ke pramukh deenanath batra hai
 In August this year, a report by Prachi Verma of the Economic Times published that many students are failing in the first year due to English medium and they are being expelled from the institute
 chah iaiti main kareeb 1 pratishat chaatr pehle varsh main angrezi ke kaaran nikaal diye jate hai
 Out of 3000 students of IIT Kanpur, 30 students were fired
 iaiti dilli ke 850 chaatro main se 12 ko nikaala gaya
 According to the percentage, the number of students fired due to language is less, but if someone goes out of such a large institution due to English, then his language and social background should also be seen
 aap jaanate hai ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay nai shiksha niti par salaah mashwara kar rahaa he
 Education Culture Upliftment Trust has only given suggestions

 South Indian states also have questions

 In such a situation, no work is done without English

 English is a global language
 2014 main modi sarkaar aane ke saath hindi or sanskrit ko lekar ek khaas kism kii sakriyata dikhi lekin abhi tak sarkaar ne vyapak str par aisa kuch thos nahin kiya he jisase lage ki wo angrezi samaapt kar hindi yaa bhartiya bhashaaon ko protsaahit karne ja rahi he
 On the question of language, the BJP could talk on camera, but it is not necessary that the sources always like the camera
 2005 main yashpal cameti ne neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha tha ki skulon main shiksha kaa madhyam ghar main boli jane vaali bhashaa hi ho

 2005 ke neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha gaya he ki angrezi shuru karne ke str kaa maamla raajnneetik he, naa ki iske peeche koi academik yaa upyogita kaa mudda he

 iske alaava aresas se judi sanstha kaa suzav he ki har vishvavidhyalay das gaavon ko god le or shikshan sansthaaen ek basti yaa gaanv god len

 It was the era of the Second World War when two engineers, Walter Dornberger and Werner von Bronn, built missiles for the Nazi army
 ye belistic missile ek tarah kaa ve 2 rocket tha
 It was first used in 1944 for the attack on London, but the interesting thing is that it was not used by Germany
 is pehali missile kaa nirmaan or isse judi kahani kaaphi rochak he
 Even though today the us-russia are at number one in terms of missiles and weapons, the world's first missile was made by Germany
 baad main yaheen ke vaigyanikon ne rus or america ke liye misile banaain
 During World War II, Germany converted a village into a missile factory
 is gaanv kaa naam tha penmunde jahaan 1935 main german ejeeniyar varnor won bron ne apana missile kaarkaana shuru kiya
 Engineer Walter Robert Dornberger was born on six September
 wo german sena ke topakhane ke adhikari the
 It was during his tenure that World War i and World War II took place
 wo naaji germany ke V-2 rocket kaarykram or pinamunde army research centre main anya pariyojnaon ko lead kar rahe the
 In October 1918 Dornberger was captured by the United States Marine and spent two years in a war camp
 unke kai baar bhaagane kii koshishon ke chalate unhen ekant karawas main rakhaa gaya
 When it comes to education, Dornberger earned an MS degree in mechanical engineering
 1935 main dornaburger ko ek maanad doctoret kii oopaadhi mili
 He was appointed Senior Artillery Commander in 1944 in the German Army
 1945 main unhone oparation baikaphire main hissaa liya tha
 Here he was caught by the British War Crimes Investigation alleging that he had employed slave laborers in the making of his V2 rocket
 mangal grah par maanav mishan kii vakaalat karne vaale varnor megnas meximilian frihir won bron ek german or baad main america airospes ejeeniyar rahe
 He was a unique space architect in himself
 unka janm 23 march 1912 main hua tha or mrityu saal 1977 main hui
 Werner, who was a pioneer in the development of rocket technology in Germany, was also a pioneer in rocket technology and space science in the United States
 won bron ne naaji germany ke rocket vikaas kaarykram main kaam kiya
 During the Second World War, he helped design and develop the V-2 rocket in Germany
 yuddh ke baad, wo oparation paperclip kaa hissaa bane or kareeb 1,600 anya german vaigyanikon, ejiniyaron or takanicianon ke saath gupt rup se sanyukt rajya america le jaae gaye
 Here he worked on an intermediate-class ballistic missile program for the US military, and he developed the rockets that launched the United States' first space satellite explorer
 bibisi kii ek report ke mutabik rocket ke pareekshan ke baad ye donon vaigyanik maan rahe the ki isaki madad se wo doosraa vishwa yuddh aasaani se jeet jate
 Albert Speer, responsible for developing new weapons in Germany, also agreed
 magar germany ke taanashaah hitler ko is par yakeen nahin tha
 For this reason, the German government did not give much credence to the successful test of the rocket
 jab hitler ne 1939 main yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii to wo wo kaarkaana puri tarah se taiyaar nahin tha
 Then in 1943, Dornberger and von Bronn showed Hitler a film of a successful test of the A-4 rocket
 ise dekhakar hitler ne is pehali missile ke nirmaan ko hari jhandi di
 But by then it was too late
 german fujen tamaam morche par haar gai thim

 The much-awaited expansion of its Council of Ministers was included in the nearly one-month-old Arjun Munda government of Jharkhand by including nine new ministers on Friday

 On the auspicious occasion of Mahalayam in Raj Bhavan, Governor MOH Farooq, bjp's Baijnath Ram, Vimala Pradhan and Satyanand Jha Batul, Hemlal Murmu of JM, Haji Hussain Ansari, Mathura Prasad Mahato and Champai Soren, jdu's King Peter and ajsu's Chandra Prakash Chaudhary was sworn in as a minister
 naye mantriyon ko milakar ab rajya mantriparishad main mukhyamantri samet kul 12 sadsy ho gayi hai
 The state of Jharkhand with an 81-member assembly should have a twelve-member Council of Ministers as per the constitution
 mukhyamantri bhaajapa ke arjuna munda ne pichley maah kii nau taarikh ko rajya main sarkaar banane kaa daawa karne ke baad ajasu ke sudesh mahato env jhamumo ke hemanth sorain ke saath 11 sitambar ko hi shapath grahan kar lee thi
 But due to all the pulls, the Council of Ministers could not be expanded till now

 Earlier, to make room for the expansion of the Council of Ministers in the state, till Thursday night there was a tussle between various coalition members and mlas of different parties, due to which the Chief Minister could send a formal proposal for the expansion of his Council of Ministers and the list of new ministers to the Governor at nine o'clock

 Earlier, Chief Minister Arjun Munda had gone to New Delhi on Wednesday to talk to the top BJP leaders before finalizing the cabinet expansion and returned on Thursday after talks with the BJP leadership there
 ranchi pahunchane ke baad unhone apni party ke netaan or sahyogi dalon ke saath vistrut vichaar vimarsh ke baad nau naye mantriyon kii suchi taiyaar kii jise raatri main rajbhavan preshit kiya gaya
 It is known that Governor moh Farooq wrote a letter to Chief Minister Arjun Munda on October 1, asking him to extend his cabinet by October 8 in any case
 rajyapal ne apane patr main samvidhan ke anuchhed 164 (1e) kaa hawala bhi diya he jiske anusaar mantrimandal kaa aakaar kisi bhi rajya main 12 se kam nahin hona chahie
 Arjun Munda was sworn in along with his two coalition partners JMM and two deputy chief ministers of AJSU on September 11, but the state cabinet could not be expanded since then due to the pull of ministerial positions
 nayi sarkaar ne 14 sitambar ko rajya vidhansabha ke vishesh satr main apana bahumat bhi sabit kar diya tha
 The Congress and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha and several other parties and organizations have sought to sack the new government by making a huge delay in the expansion of the Council of Ministers in the new government amidst a fierce battle for the post of minister in the state
 rajyapal ne apane patr main mukhyamantri ko spasht rup se likhaa tha ki yadi aath aktubar ko samvidhan ke praavdhaanon ke tahat rajya main mantrimandal kaa vistaar nahi kiya jaataa he to vah is sambandh main report kendra sarkaar ko bhej denge
 The Governor had also objected to the tribal welfare ministry being held with the Chief Minister and termed it a violation of the provisions of Article 164 (1) of the Constitution
 mukhyamantri karyaalay ne is sambandh main puche jane par spasht kiya tha ki mukhyamantri ne rajyapal ko mantrimandal vistaar ke bare main 28 sitambar ko hi likh diya tha or unase aath aktubar kaa samay bhi maanga tha
 In such a situation, no one should have any doubt about the expansion of the cabinet in the state
 mukhyamantri sachivalay ne bataaya ki isse purv bhi mantrimandal vistaar kaa kaary kiya ja saktaa tha lekin pitru paksh is kaary ke liye shubh na hone se hi mantrimandal vistaar kaa kaam aath taarikh ke liye taala gaya jab mahalayarambh ho rahaa he
 Several others, including Congress, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha Prajatantrik and former Deputy Chief Minister of BJP Raghuvar Das were absent at Raj Bhavan during the expansion program of the Council of Ministers on Friday, while top representatives of all other parties and top officials of the government were present
 shapath grahan ke dauraan rajya ke purv mukhyamantri shibu sorain urf guru ji bhi upasthit the or unhone nayi sarkaar ke mantriyon ko apana aashirwad diya

 The recently elected BJP government in the state is preparing to promote the Patanjali range of consumer goods and other products of Yoga Gurubaba Ramdev through a network of fair price government shops

 This stereotyped image of Bihar became so strongly associated with public perception that it became politically and literally called a "jungle state"
 vahiin aarthik taur par isane anivaary taur par kam aamadani or kangaali ke dushchakr main fanse bimaaru (apni aarthik badahaali ke liye bihar, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, odisha or uttar pradesh ke pehle aksharon ko milakar banaaya gaya chota naam) rajya kii nakaaratmak or gumraah karne vaali tasviir banaai, jisamen yah hindustan ke nakshe main neeche phisalata hua sust or murjhaata rajya tha
 The actual picture is quite the opposite
 aitihaasik taur par bihar hindustan ke teen sabase pehle or sabase shaktishaalee samrajyon kii gauravshaalee or paaramparik dharti rahaa tha—pehla tha ajatshatru ke maatahat magadh samrajya (isa purv chhathi or paanchavin shatabdi), maury samrajya (332 isa purv-185 isa purv) jisamen uske budhimaan or shaktishaalee samraat ashok shaamil the or gupt samrajya (320 se 350 isvi) jisaki aguai samudragupta or chandragupta-11 ne kii thi

 Throughout its ancient history, Bihar has been the land of development of Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism and later Islam and Sikhism
 lekin aazaadee ke baad patan ke lambey daur rahe
 a sharp decline was observed in 15 years between 1990 and 2005

 Bihar has grown at an annual growth rate of over 10 per cent in the last decade and has more than doubled its economy
 bihar ke aarthik survey ke mutabik, 2016-17 ke dauraan is rajya ne 10
 Achieved an economic growth rate of 3 percent, while the national average was 7 percent during this period
 bihar kii oonchi vruddhi dar kii kuch vajah ye ho sakati hai—aarthik tehraav ke chalate pichley dashak kaa nichalaa aadhaar or vaishvik vruddhi ke khaasaa tej daur (2003-2012) kaa acha asar
 But the thing that particularly affects is to maintain the double digit growth of Bihar's economy for a decade
 vahiin duusare bimaaru rajyon se tulana karen, to misaal ke liye iskaa pashchimi padosi uttar pradesh is dauraan 6
 Slow growth of 6%

 In other ways, Bihar grew at a faster pace despite being surrounded by land and less connected with the global economy, while Odisha's growth rate was lower than that of the sea and global trade was much closer
 
 hakeekat to yah he ki agar ham bihar kii vruddhi ke pichley record kii sabhi bimaaru rajyon se tulana karen, to yah rajya unamem kahin aage najar aata he
 There is one more thing that has happened along with this is the significant increase in literacy of Bihar, especially after 2001
 saal 2001 or 2011 ke dauraan mote taur par sarv shiksha abhiyaan or nijee skulon ke failaav ke chalate bihar kii sakshartaa dar 47 fisadi se chalaang lagaakar 64 fisadi par pahunch gai
 Never before has there been such an increase of nearly 17 percentage points
 sakshartaa dar main is kayapalat kii ek khaas baat mahila sakshartaa main ai oochaal he
 Bihar's female literacy rate is increasing by nearly 18 percent, with the national female literacy rate filling up
 iske baavjood sakshartaa main desh ke anya pradeshon kii barabari main aane ke liye bihar ko abhi lanbaa rasta tay karnaa hoga, kyonki 2018 main bihar kii sakshartaa dar 64 fisadi he jabaki desh kaa ausat 74 fisadi he
 Despite the potential driver of Bihar's growth being caught in the trap of poverty and many challenges facing the state, this metamorphosis in Bihar has sparked a serious debate among economists
 arthshaastri arvind viramani apane lekh "bihar'' growth—larning from experions'' main bihar kii aarthik vruddhi ko tej karne vaale sector aadhaarit chaalkon kii ore dhyaan dilaate hai
 Virmani compares two periods — from 1993–94 to 2004–05, when the country's annual economic growth averaged 6
 8 fisadi thi tathaa 2004-05 se lekar 2011-12 jab desh kii salanaa aarthik vruddhi 8
 Was 3 percent
 pehle vaali miyaad main bihar kii ausat vruddhi salanaa 5
 3 per cent, but in the latter period it was an unprecedented 11 annually
 7 fisadi par pahunch gai
 In the second period, the economic growth rate more than doubled from the earlier growth rate
 viramani kehete hai, "yah vruddhi dar, jo rashtriya ausat se mahaj 80 fisadi thi, badhkar rashtriya ausat vruddhi dar se 1
 7 was doubled and thus began the process of Bihar coming on par with the rest of the world
 ''agar 2005-06 ko, jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar satta main aae, vibhaajak saal ke taur par liya jaae, to vruddhi kii yah raftaar or bhi tej najar aati he
 Virmani states, "this growth rate between 1993-94 to 2005-064
 8 fisadi ke salanaa ausat se badhkar 2005-06 se 2011-12 ke bich 13
 Reached an annual average of 5 per cent
 '' agar 2004-05 se 2014-15 ke lambey vakt ke rujhaan ko len, to sabase sakht akalan ke hisaab se bhi bihar kii ausat vruddhi dar dahaai ankon main yani 10 fisadi salanaa kaayam rahati he
 Separate the overall growth rate, then what were the main sectors that were taking the growth rate forward? Six out of 17 sectors surpassed the average growth rate of 10 per cent
 viramani kaa akalan he, "ye sector the sanchaar (27
 5 per cent), construction (21
 8 fisadi), banking or beemaa (19
 4 per cent), mining and digging (14
 1 fisadi), registerd manuphaccharing (13
 1 per cent) and trade, hotels and restaurants (12 per cent)
 ''dayaneey rajkaaj or rajya kii kamatar kshamta ke lambey daur ke baad nitish kumaar ne jo kanoon or vyavastha behaal kii, vah bihar kii vruddhi kii mukchay vajah rahi he
 It generally created such a mold of development that many activities were started
 isane sabase pehle rajya se udhyamiyon ke palaayan ko roka jo chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh sareekhe padosi rajyon main ja rahe the
 The reality is that it enticed some Bihari migrants to invest once again in the state
 isse nijee or saarvajanik, donon nirmaan ke kaamon main achaanak teji aane lagi or ye bihar kii vruddhi ke duusare chaalak ban gaye
 This was followed by rapid growth in the infrastructure, energy and communications sectors
 rashtriya rajmargon or rajya ke rajmargon donon kii sadakon main jabardast sarkari nivesh hua
 Rural and urban networks became the arteries of business and economic activity and growth
 seva kshetra—banking or beemaa—main oochaal ai or ye vruddhi ke ahm chaalak bane
 One of the reasons for the boom in banking and insurance activities was the increase in people going out and sending money to their families from abroad as well as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and from the western and southern states of the country to Bihar
 hospitality kshetra—vyapaar, hotel or restaraan—main oochaal kaa isamen ahm yogadan rahaa
 Half-complete metamorphosis? What are the limits of such rapid metamorphosis in the economy? Economist Kaushik Basu admits that significant metamorphosis has taken place, but he also points out that there has been no significant reduction in poverty as a result of Bihar's high growth rate
 basu is nattejey par pahunchate hai, "2004-05 or 2009-10 ke bich bihar main garib logon main mushkil se hi koi kami ai, jabaki rashtriya str par isse ulataa hua tha
 The number of poor in Bihar has actually increased in the last five years
 isliye aage abhi jabardast chunauti bani hui he
 "but Oxford economist Sabina Alkire, who has studied the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in all countries of the world, is not convinced by this," More than half of all the multidimensional poor in India live in four states
 garibi ke kshetra puure bharat main paae jate hai, par bahuaiami garibi chaar rajyon—bihar, jharkhand, uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh main khaas taur par gambhir or ahm he

 6 karod emypi garib in rajyon main hai—jo desh ke kul emypi garibon ke aadhe hai
 "but there was also progress
" alakire kahati hai, "bahuaiami garibi ko kam karne main sabhi rajyon main jharkhand ne sabase oonchi chalaang lagaai he, jabaki arunachal pradesh, bihar, chhattisgarh or nagaland bahut thode hi peeche hai
 "alkyre has studied multidimensional poverty reduction in all states of India from 2005-06 to 2015-16
" duusare kaarak kya hai jinaki badaulat 2004-05 main bihar kaa kayapalat hua? 14wein vitt ayog ke purv sadsy professor sudipto mundley bihar kii vruddhi kii kahani ko saarvajanik vitt ke nazariye se dekhte hai, jisamen vikaas kaaryakramon ke liye saarvajanik kharchon ke rannatik lakshya tay kiye gaye or rajkoshiya majbootee laai gai
 Says Mundle, "the second reason for Bihar's strong performance in terms of growth in recent years is the strengthening of fiscal condition
 bihar ke vikaas ke shandaar kayapalat main rajasav khate main rakam ke bachane kii shuruyaat, puunjigat kharch kaa badhata hissaa or vikaas ke kaamon par badhata kharch sabase ahm hai
 "one of the powerful ways to emphasize capital in the public sector is capital expenditure
" duusare lakrajon main, puunjigat kharch sadakon, doorsanchaar or bijli vitaran vyavastha sareekhe saarvajanik bhalaai ke kaamon par kharch ke aankade muhaiyaa karata he
 At the same time, government spending on all services of development can be judged by development expenditure, which includes both capital expenditure and revenue
 rajasav vruddhi or jidispi kaa anupaat rajkoshiya majbootee kii taraf le gaya, jiskaa shrey rajya ke rajasav main badhotaree ko hi nahin balki centre se milane vaali rakam main ijaphe ko bhi diya ja saktaa he
 The central government accounts for 75 per cent of Bihar's revenue
 haalanki centre se milane vaali rakam kaa mukhya hissaa kendriya karon main bihar kaa anivaary hissaa he, jisaki sifarish kai vitt aayogon ne kii he
 The Nobel-winning economist Amartya Sen, who became the first vice-chancellor of Nalanda University, started with a new vigil, goes into the depths of Bihar's glorious history and gives this debate a long-term view
 sen likhte hai, "pehla akhil bhartiya samrajya, yani maury samrajya, patliputra se sanchalit hota tha, jo nayaa patna he, or isane desh bhar ke bade hisson main kanoon or vyavastha kii ekarupata sthapit kii thi
 "poor states like special status status Bihar are heavily dependent on central funds
 krishi, praathmik shiksha, swasthya, kanoon-vyavastha or rajya ke anya maamalon kii apni jimmedaariyon par kharch kii purti ke liye tex vasuulne kii unki shaktiyaan kaaphi kam padati hai
 The main thing in the central revenue system is that citizens of all the states of the country should get the same level of public service at the same tax value under the unified national jurisdiction
 vittiya ayog isamen kuch hi madad kar pate hai kyonki ve kendriya fund ke ek hisse kaa kuch dhan hi muhaiyaa karvaa pate hai
 The Gadgil formula also helps a little
 mundley ke mutabik, centre pryojit yojanaon ke tahat rajyon ko anaupchaarik rup se hi fund miltaa he, na ki kisi antarraji nishpaksh niyam ke tahat
 Bihar has been the worst victim of this federal transfer system
 mundley kehete hai ki chunki bihar saamaanya shrenee ke rajyon ke bich sabase garib rajya he, isliye "apane vittiya nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye centre se ek vishesh sahaayta package se praapt karne kaa iskaa daawa sabase majboot he
 '' Public finance expert M
 govinda raav kaa tark he, "bihar kii kshatipurti ke liye aparyaapt kendriya hastantaran ke kaaran bihar prati vyakti vikaas vyay ke lihaaj se saamaanya shrenee ke rajyon main sabase nichle paaydaan par khadaa he
 Its per capita development expenditure is equal to half of the average per capita development expenditure in all states of the country and one-third of the average of the highest spending states
 '' prati vyakti aay ke lihaaj se to bihar sabase pichhadaa rajya he hi, yah shiksha, swasthya or aarthik tathaa saamaajik sevaaon par kharch main bhi sabase peeche rah gaya he
 Says Rao, "the case of the special aid package for Bihar is further strengthened by the fact that the transfer gap exists despite concerted efforts by the state government on fiscal consolidation
 ''kshetreey bhinnata or saanskrithik vividhtaganga or uski sahaayak nadiyon—kamala, kosi, son or kai anya choti nadiyon se laai gai upjau jalodh mitti, bharpoor pani or vanaspati tathaa jaev vividhta bihar kaa sabase mahatvapurn prakritik sansaadhan he
 The entire Bihar is situated on the Gangetic plain, where the hills with common slopes are found somewhere in the north, south and east of the Ganges
 himalay kii ore se nikalne vaali kosi, kamala or gandak jaisi nadiyon kii badaulat uttari bihar main pani kii uplabdhta dakshini bihar ke mukaable behatar he
 And these rivers of North Bihar are also the cause of floods
 madhubani, shivahar, supaul, saharsa, madhepura or arriya jile-kamala or kosi ke bich main padate hai
 There is always a possibility of flood in these areas
 ye jile prati vyakti aay ke lihaaj se bihar ke sabase pichde jile hai or inhen kshetron se mazdooron kaa sabase zyada palaayan hota he
 When the flood waters recede, the fields become quite fertile and there is good cultivation of fruits like paddy, wheat, maize, lentils, mustard, sugarcane as well as mango, litchi and banana
 aamtaur par ganga ke uttar kii tulana main dakshin kaa bhooplaster bahut kam he
 Rainfall is slightly more in the Northeast
 ganga nadi rajya ko uttar or dakshin bihar main vibhajit karti he
 This natural division is also the main economic division of the state
 uttar bihar ke ulat dakshin bihar samrudh hai
 South Bihar is more urbanized and has cities such as Patna, Gaya, Munger, Bhagalpur, Barauni and Begusarai
 uttar main inke mukaable kaa ekmaatr shahar mujkrafarpur hi dikhataa he
 Other urban centers are basically large populated towns
 darbhanga ek samay par rajya ke sabase achche medical college, do sheersh vishvavidhyalayon, ek hawaii adde (darbhanga vimaanan darbhanga raaj kii nijee swaamitv vaali ek cargo airline thi jise baad main vaayu sena ne adhigrahit kar liya or iske paas bihar kaa sabase bada ranve he) or sangemarmar se bane nargauna mahal samet vibhinn mehalon ke saath apane vaibhavpurn ateet par itaraa saktaa he
 But now it is getting dilapidated
 janata dal (you) ke vidhaan parishad sadsy sanjay jha kehete hai, "dilli, kolkata or mumbai ke saath uttar bihar ko sidhe jodgaye ke liye airport ke punarnirmaan or 2019 tak ise karyanvit karne kii disha main gambhir prayaas ho rahe hai
 "air connectivity development also gets momentum and the situation in the northeast of the state is Kishanganj which is close to Bagdogra Airport in the neighboring state of West Bengal and has benefited immensely
" uttar bihar adhik saghan aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 It is economically poor but culturally rich

 Folklore and theater have been enriched in the Bhojpuri-speaking region of Saran as Bidesiya of Nautanki and Bhikhari Thakur
 dakshin bihar main aabaadi utani saghan nahin he
 The area here is partly hilly, irrigation facilities are much richer than North Bihar due to the network of canals
 isamen patna, munger, bihar sharif or nalanda ke bade shahari centre shaamil hai
 Nalanda had the oldest university in India that flourished between 500 and 1200 CE
 ab use nae sire se antarrashtriya centre ke rup main viksit kiya gaya he
 Due to regional and cultural diversity as well as extreme poverty in some districts and economically prosperous in some districts, a comparative study of various districts of the state has been made to understand the situation
 is drudh vishwaas ke saath ki desh kaa bhavishya unke rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main hi he, hamane 2003 se rajyon kii dasha or disha surveykshan shuru kiya
 It has emerged as a reliable standard of performance assessment for states
 isamen ek nishchit samay ke dauraan vibhinn shreniyon main har rajya ke jilon ke pradarshan kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 Each category is usually a composite index of some of the parameters that are analyzed at different time intervals, provided the data are available
 bihar ke maamle main, pradesh ke sabhi 38 jilon kaa tulanaatmak vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 Urban areas have been more profitable than far-flung rural areas
 phir bhi, kuch ubharate jile vibhinn shreniyon main sheersh par najar aate hai
 These include districts such as Kishanganj on the north-western corner of the state, Rohtas and Kaimur in the south-east, even Darbhanga, Madhubani and Shivhar districts, considered as the poor belt of Bihar
 agar rajnatik duuradrushti garib rajya kaa kayapalat kar sakati he, to jile ke adhikariyon kii sthaneey duuradrushti jilon kii bhi tasviir badal sakati he
 Apart from this, Patna is the most prosperous district of Bihar and also in the overall development, Patna plays a big role in the development of the state
 krishi se judi chunautiyanrajya main adhikansh logon kii aajeevika kaa mukhya strot krishi he
 It provides disease to 66 percent of the total workers of the state and 75 percent of some workers working in rural areas
 inamen se zyaadaatar chote kisaan or krishi majdoor hai
 Agricultural holdings are divided into very small pieces and about 85 percent of the farmers have less than one hectare of land
 rajya kaa fasal pattern bhi ek nirvaah arthvyavastha vaala hi he jisamen ugaai jane vaali fasalon main 87 pratishat hissaa anaajon kaa he
 Rice and wheat are cultivated on 44 percent and 26 percent of the total agricultural land of the state respectively
 iske alaava, nirvaah fasal kaa yah pattern samay ke saath or sakchat hota gaya
 Comparing Bihar with agronomically advanced states like Madhya Pradesh, you will find that despite the relatively favorable and fertile soil and better climatic conditions, the average yield rate of most crops in Bihar is low
 chaaval or gehun kii ausat utpaadakta rashtriya ausat kii tulana main 20 se 25 pratishat kam he or krishi kshetra main sarvshereshth pradarshan karne vaale madhya pradesh jaise rajyon ke to aadhe se bhi kam he
 The reasons for the backwardness of Bihar's economy include its poor law and order in the past, as well as decaying infrastructure and very little investment
 ateet main rajya main bijli kii bhi baari killat rahi he
 The Bihar government's Har Ghar Bijli Yojana, started in November 2016, has transformed villages
 pehle rajya main prati vyakti bijli kii khapat 112 prati kilowat-ghante (kedbluech) thi
 Today it has more than tripled 360 kilowatt-hours
 phir bhi yah 1,200 kedbluech ke rashtriya ausat kii tulana main kaaphi kam he
 But the main reason for low power consumption in Bihar is the acute lack of industries in the state
 maharashtra or gujarat jaise audyogic rup se viksit rajyon main 40 pratishat upabhokta haai tension upabhokta hai yani bijli audyogic ikaayiyon main istemaal ho rahi he
 Electricity demand in Bihar has increased two and a half times in three years: from 1,800 MW in 2014 to 4,600 MW in 2017
 rajya ne 2019 kii shuruyaat tak is maang ko badhaakar 6,000 megawatt tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Every household electricity scheme is expected to increase agricultural productivity
 krishi ke liye samarpit alag-alag krishi feader banaae gaye hai
 At present, there are 1,312 feeders dedicated to agriculture
 is saal ke ant tak anya 800 feader chaalu karne kii yojana he
 This will give a boost to agriculture, as well as save on spending on diesel pump sets
 gujarat or madhya pradesh kii tarj par yahaan krishi utpaadakta ke badaae kii sambhaavna he
 At present, agriculture accounts for only 3-4 per cent of the total power consumption in the state
 iske 18-20 fisadi tak pahunchane kii sambhaavna he
 The new industrial strategy Bihar is largely dependent on jobs and partly on agriculture
 rajya main kisi bhi prakaar ke audyogic kshetra kaa puri tarah abhaav dikhataa he kyonki saal 2000 main rajya ko vibhajit karke isse jharkhand ko alag kiya gaya
 The entire mineral rich Chotanagpur plateau of the south went to Jharkhand
 kuch arase tak rajya main udyog ke naam par ek maatr kshetra nirmaan kshetra hi rahaa he
 Food processing, manufacturing, dairy and healthcare were later added to this list
 apane chote aadhaar ke saath hi sahi par audyogic vikaas dar main teji ai lekin phir bhi is audyogic kshetra kaa rajya kii aarthik sthiti par koi bada prabhaav nahin dikhaa
 Now the state will have to travel a long way to develop industry

 Bihar's performance in terms of social and human development indicators is very poor

 The most worrying aspect of this is the high rate of dropout in Bihar
 rajya main dropaut dar (kaksha 1 se aathvin) 70 pratishat ke chintajanak str par he jabaki puure bharat main yah dar mahaj 43 pratishat he
 In health indicators, Bihar is better than the sick states but below the national average

 Lalu Yadav overturned the social base of the upper castes, upper classes of Bihar politics and formed a muslim-yadav (MY) alliance which was also supported by some Dalit groups
 lekin lalu yadav 15 saal tak khud or uske baad apni patni rabari devi ke jariye rajya kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baavjood un tabakon ke aarthik halaat ko badalane ke liye kuch khaas nahin kar paae
 In fact, Lalu Prasad Yadav is known as a leader who pushed Bihar into a financially stagnant and political chaos and darkness from the perspective of law and order

 The state has witnessed several political upsets in the last 13 years

 Nitish Kumar, once again introducing political acrobatics, took Lalu's hand and joined BJP

 With double-digit growth rates, Bihar began writing a new chapter of development and good governance, with fiscal prudence, targeted development of infrastructure, large scale electrification of villages, encouragement of girls to come to school and alcohol prohibition
 jis rajya kii arthvyavastha mukchay rup se seva kshetra ke aasare ho, uske liye lambey samay tak salanaa do ankon kii aarthik vruddhi ko banaae rakhana bahut mushkil he
 Although recently there has been some emphasis on agriculture with horticulture and food processing industry, compared to states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, agricultural productivity is still quite low in Bihar
 bihar ko vikaas kii apni ranneeti badalane kii jarurat he
 The state needs to emphasize on the development of agriculture by focusing more attention on dealing with the floods in the north and drought conditions in the south

 The failure of agriculture in the state and lack of jobs for the youth is causing an endless migration of people of Bihar to other southern and western states of the country, even the middle-east and other regions of the world

 But this whole story of Bihar's change is based on the service sector and agriculture has some stake in it
 udyogikaran se abhaav se bihar ke vikaas kii is kahani ko gati nahin mil paa rahi he
 Some initiatives have been taken to develop the IT sector, but due to lack of mineral wealth (which had moved to Jharkhand in 2000), Bihar's policy makers have been battered
