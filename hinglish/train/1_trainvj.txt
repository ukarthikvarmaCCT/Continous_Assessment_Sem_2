gajiabad aalaa police adhikariyon ke anusaar khodaa thane main yuvak kii missing report darj kii gai he
 The youth's car was recovered by the police from miscreants during an encounter in Meerut
 haalanki yuvak kaa koi suraag badmaashon se nahin mila 
 The police have gone to jail and interrogated the miscreants
 jaankaree mili ki badmaashon ko car laavaaris haalat main khadi mili jise badmaash chori kar le gayi the
 And in the vicinity of the location from which the car was stolen, the missing young man Krishna was also searched
 lekin koi suraag yuvak kaa police ko nahin mila
 Now the police are trying to locate the young man through interrogation routes and relatives of the missing youth
 6 maheene kaa samay biit chukaa he lekin dilli se sate gajiabad kii hytech police bhi yuvak ko dhughane main naakaam he
 Many questions are being raised on the working style of the police
 jabaki yuvak kii car meerut main muthbhed ke dauraan badmaashon se baraamad hui thi
 The police should have cross-checked the statements of the miscreants by bringing the miscreants to Ghaziabad on remand so that the truth of the miscreants' statement could be revealed
 vahiin aapako bataa den ki yuvak kii last lokation indirapuram main mangal bazaar chowk ke aasapaas kii ai thi
 And in the past years, there were many such incidents here that the miscreants had kidnapped people including the car from this area and escaped by throwing them in a drunken state on Meerut and its surrounding routes
 badmaashon se yuvak krishna kii car milane ke baad ashanka yah bhi he ki ki aise hi kisi ghatana kaa shikaar to laapata yuvak nahin ho gaya
 However, the police has not been able to find any trace of the young man
 ab yuvak kaa parivaar uske milane kii aas main har din thane or police ke chakkar lagane ko majaboor hai

 Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP coalition may be sealed today i
e
 on Friday, but before that a big information is coming out that if Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray does not accept the post of Chief Minister, then party MP Sanjay Raut can take over Huh
 shivasena main uddhav thakare ke baad siem pad kii res main sanjay raut hi aage chal rahe hai
 Earlier in the meeting on Thursday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar tried to convince Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray that he should step down as Chief Minister
 baithak main maujuud rahe shivasena saansad sanjay raut or aditya thakare ne bhi uddhav ko siem pad sanbhaalane ke liye kaha
 The meeting of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP in Maharashtra, the political drama which has been going on for the last one month, may now end
 dilli ke baad shuukravaar ko mumbai main mulakaaton kaa final daur he
 Where Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP will also meet among themselves
 mana ja rahaa he ki shaam main saajha press conference main nai sarkaar ke formule kaa elaan hoga
 It is almost certain that Uddhav Thackeray will be the next Chief Minister
 teen dal chaahate hai anbhavi netaa ke haath main ho kamanasootron kaa kahana he kimaharashtra ke agle mukhyamantri uddhav thakrehi honge
 Actually, not only Shiv Sena but Congress and NCP also want that Maharashtra's command should be given in the hands of experienced leaders like Uddhav Thackeray, because Aditya Thackeray does not have deep experience in politics, senior leaders of both the parties who became CM Will become a minister, he may feel uncomfortable with Aditya
 janata ko uddhav thakare par bharosaavaheen teen dalon ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaane kaa jimmaa abhi aditya ke kandhe par nahin daalaa ja saktaa
 If Uddhav can form a government by keeping Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi in such a situation, then he can also run the government of Maharashtra for five years
 isliye sutron kaa kahana he ki maharashtra ke agle mukhyamantri uddhav thakare hi honge
 However, it is yet to be formally announced
 sanjay raut bole- janata chaahati he uddhav bane siemsanjay raut ne shuukravaar ko ek baar phir kaha ki shivasena kaa hi mukhyamantri hoga
 Raut said that in Maharashtra 5 will be the CM of Shiv Sena for 5 years
 unhone kaha, har koi chahta he ki uddhav thakare hi mukhyamantri kaa pad sanbhaalein, kyonki janata bhi yahi chaahati he
 Apart from this, not only in the Shiv Sena but also the demand of the three parties that Uddhav take over the post of Chief Minister of Thackeray
 philhal desh main sabase zyada saarvajanik bahason kaa mudda 36 rafel vimaanon kii kharid kaa hi he
 Between this and I, i remembered an old saying, 'don't confuse me with facts
' hamaare rashtriya netagan ek-duusare ko chor-beyimaan, jhuthe, dhokheybaaj or bhrasht bataa rahe hai
 Even the current and former presidents of Pakistan and France have been dragged between these allegations and counter-allegations
 aisa lag rahaa he ki desh kii do rashtriya partiyaan nahin balki do mukkebaaz ring main hai, jinaki ankhon par pattee baandh di gai he
 And they are throwing indiscriminate punches in the air with the thought of not knowing which one of the punches that will make the opposition sit around
 sachaai kaa galaa ghontne ko amada na jane kitne ardh-satya hawa main tair rahe hai
 Industrialist Anil Ambani is the worst trapped in this storm
 sara vivaad 30,000 karod rupye ke 'offsets' ke aasapaas kendrit he jise daso or uske sahyogiyon ko bhartiya nirmaataaon ke saath kharchana hoga or yah 59,000 karod rupye ke rafel jahaajon ke saude se judaa hi ho, yah bhi jaruri nahin he
 The allegation is that Chhote Ambani is closely associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 isi kaaran daso ko sanket die gaye ki vah ambani kii company ke saath ek joint venture banaakar 30,000 karod rupye ke kaarobaar main saajheedaar banaae
 However, there is no truth in the allegation that the entire work of Offset is being given to Ambani's company
 is saude kii saajhedaar francisi companiyon- safaran, thels, daso aviation- ne ofaset ke liye 72 companiyon kii pahchaan kii he
 It is expected that Ambani will also get a good job, but the biggest beneficiary of this deal will be the country's government organization Defense Research and Development Organization or DRDO, which is expected to get a job of Rs 9,000 crore
 doosraa bada mudda yah he ki ambani ke paas raksha nirmaan kaa koi purana anubhav nahin he or unke zyaadaatar udhyam asafal rahe hai
 Most of their group companies are in dire financial straits and have 1 on them till March 2018
 12 lakh karod rupye kaa baari-bharkam karj tha
 That was not enough, some suspicious 'coincidences' also appear to be formed with him
 unhone 10 april 2015 ko, rafel saude kii ghoshnaa ke maatr 12 din pehle hi apni raksha company banaai thi
 His entertainment company financed a film produced by former French President François Hollande's partner and actor Julie Gaye
 ambani kii company ne is baat kii baqayada press vijyapti jari karke ghoshnaa us dauraan kii thi, jab 26 janvari 2017 ko ganatantr diwas parade ke mukhya atithi ke taur par oland bharat aae the
 And this is the reason that the Ambani has come under attack from the people
 baat itane par nahin rukii
 Hollande, in a conversation with mediapart, a French website last week, set ablaze, saying that he had no role in choosing Ambani's company as an offset partner to Dasso, the Indian government himself had proposed Ambani's name
 or yah bayaan tab aayaa, jab bharat sarkaar jor dekar yah kah rahi thi ki ambani ko saajhedaar banane kaa faisla daso kaa apana nirnay tha, bharat sarkaar kii isamen koi bhoomika nahin he
 After this, panic-stricken efforts to save their lives started and both governments are saying that whom should the slaves be their offset partners, it was their own decision
 is faisle se kisi sarkaar kaa koi lenaa dena nahin tha
 There are many other controversial issues related to the deal which make it more complicated
 jahaaj kaa vaastavik mulya kya he? chah saal pehle upie sarkaar dwaara jo rakam tay kii gai thi, kya yah usase sasta he?upie dwaara tay kii gai rakam main jo jahaaj milane the, ve hathiyaaron se puri tarah susajjit hote yaa nahin? jab upie sarkaar 126 jahaaj kharidne ke samjhaute par bad rahi thi, to ab ham keval 36 jahaaj hi kyon kharid rahe hai?echeel ko saude se baahar kyon rakhaa gaya jabaki pehle vah usamen shaamil tha? kya pradhanmantri ne sarkaar kii kharid prakriyaaon ko kaat-chhaantkar chota kar diya? hamaare kaaryakari sampadak or raksha visheshgy sandip unnithan kii cover story isse jude har paksh kaa gaharaai se vishleshan karti he
 However, Rafael has become an excuse for a dirty political scandal
 haalanki is saude main madhyasthon yaa rishwatakhori kaa koi spasht saboot nahin he, boforce ghotaale kii tarah isamen koi swiss bank khaataa yaa dhan ke len-dein ke pramaan bhi nahin hai
 Furthermore, all these contracts will be completed after three to five years
 congress party ko lagata he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi garv ke saath bhrashtachar or kroni capitaljm mukt bedaag sarkaar chalaane ke jo daawey karte hai, rafel se unki is chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 In the 2014 general elections, when Modi was in the race for the post of Prime Minister, he also made similar allegations on the UPA government
 chunki chunaav ab kareeb aate ja rahe hai to rahul gandhi modi ke hathiyaar se, modi par hi prahaar ke prayaas kar rahe hai
 Whether any of these charges will survive and will become an election issue, the answer is yet to be found
 lekin itnaa to jaahir he philhal bhaajapa khud ko baikfoot par mahasoos kar rahi he
 Mudging in this way is not good for India's much awaited defense purchases
 chunki pradhanmantri ke prayaason se yah samjhauta do deshon kii sarkaron ke bich hua he isliye paardarshita hi sabase acha rasta hoga
 Put all the facts and arguments in front of everyone in a fair way so that milk can have milk and water of water

 Telecom companies face huge hike in prepaid tariff after five years Have given
 sasti kol or internet ke din chale gaye lagate hai
 Jio, Airtel, vodafone-idea have all announced huge increases in tariffs for their prepaid products and services
 isse graahakon ke mobile bill main 50 fisadi tak kii badhat ho sakati he
 Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Sunday announced a 15 to 40 percent increase in their tariffs
 yah badhat 3 disambar se lagu hogi
 Jio also announced a 40 percent increase in its new tariff plan on Sunday
 reliance jeeyo ne ek bayaan main kaha ki uskaa nayaa plan 'ol in van' chah disambar se lagu hoga
 Jio said in a statement, 'jio will bring an all-in-one plan with unlimited voice and data
 is plan main anya mobile network par kol karne ke liye uchit upyog kii niti hogi
 'the new all in one plan will be 40% more expensive
 jeeyo ke kareeb 33 karod graahak hai
 For Vodafone Idea's network, phone calls and data pre-paid consumers may now have to pay 50 per cent more
 udhaaharan ke liye idia vodaphone kaa jo 12 jibi data plan pehle 999 rupee kaa tha vah ab 1499 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Similarly, in the new plan of Airtel, every day tariff of 50 paise to 2
 85 rupee tak bad gaya he
 Talking about the plan of Rs 169 from Airtel's new plan, customers may have to pay more than 46 percent
 vodaphone ke kareeb 38 karod graahak hai, jabaki airtel ke kareeb 28 karod graahak hai
 After five years, it has been reported that due to fierce competition from telecom companies, calls and data charges in India became very cheap
 ab jo ijapha ho rahaa he, vah pichley 5 saal main pehali baar ho rahaa he
 Why the companies are increasing the tariff The telecom companies have to pay huge revenue to the government due to the Supreme Court decision on Adjusted Gross Income (AGR)
 isaki vajah se is vitt varsh kii duusari timahi main vodaphone ko bhartiya corporate jagat kaa sabase zyada 50,922 karod rupee kaa ghaataa hua he
 Also 1 above the company
 17 lakh karod rupee kii baari dendaree he
 Airtel reported a loss of Rs 23,045 crore in the second quarter of this financial year
 isliye companiyon ke paas apana tarriff badhaane ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin dikh rahaa tha
 What happens AGR Adjusted gross revenue (AGR) is the usage and licensing fees charged by telecom companies by the Department of Telecommunications (dot) in the Ministry of Communications
 iske do hisse hote hai- spectrum ujes charge or licencing fees, jo kramash 3-5 fisadi or 8 fisadi hota he
 The Department of Telecommunications states that AGR should be calculated based on the total revenue or revenue of a telecom company, including income from non-telecom sources such as deposit interest and asset sales
 duusari taraf, telecom companiyon kaa kahana he ki AGR kii gananaa sirf telecom sevaaon se hone vaali aay ke aadhaar par honi chahie
 After this, the telecom companies challenged it in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne bhi 24 oktober, 2019 ke apane aadesh main doorsanchaar vibhaag ke rukh ko sahi tehraaya or sarkaar ko yah adhikaar diya ki vah kareeb 94,000 karod rupee kii bakaayaa samyojit gros revenue (AGR) telecom companiyon se vasulein
 It is close to 1 with interest and fine
 3 lakh karod rupee ho jaataa he
 The court asked the telecom companies to deposit the outstanding amount within three months

 dekhie is video main rahul gandhi puri baat bataate hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 An attempt was made to make fun of Rahul Gandhi by removing a four-second clip from this video
 is tarah kii sharaarat soshal media par nai nahin he

 unka bhi ek video soshal medio main khub share hua tha jisamen wo ye kehete dikh rahe the ki 'pani se bijli banane par uski takat khatm ho jaaegi or wo kheton ke liye kisi kaam kaa nahin bachegaa

 video viral ho jane ke baad ashok gahalot ko is baat kaa khandan karte hue sachai bataane ke liye apni press conference kaa puraa video bhi jari kiya tha
 It is said that the first to extract electricity from water was said by Haryana socialist leader Mani Ram Bagdi

 Bhai Dooj is a festival of reverence and trust of sisters towards brothers
 is parv ko har saal karthik maas ke shukla paksh kii dwitiya tithi ke din hi manaaya jaataa he
 But very few people know about the reason for celebrating it
 bhai-bahan ke sneh kaa pratik yah parv deepawali ke do din baad manaaya jaataa he
 It is also called Yama Dwitiya
 isi vajah se is parv par yama dev kii puja kii jaati he
 According to the belief, one who worships Yama Dev does not fear premature death
 hinduon ke baaki tyoharon ki tarah yah tyohaar bhi paramparaon se judaa hua he
 On this day, sisters wish their brother a long life by applying tilak and giving him a gift
 badale main bhai apni bahan ki raksha kaa vachan detaa he
 Eating a brother's house at his sister's day is particularly auspicious
 mithila nagari main is parv ko aaj bhi yamadvitiya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 On this day rice is applied in both hands of brothers
 saath hi kuch sthanon main bhai ke haathon main sindur lagane kii bhi parampara dekhi jaati he
 Without these things, after applying a paste of vermilion and rice in the hands of the thali-bhai of incomplete Bhai Dooj, five betel leaves, betel nut and silver coin are placed on it
 us par jal udelte hue bhai kii dderghaayu ke liye mantra bolaa jaataa he
 Brothers give gifts to their sister
 bhai kii aarti utaarte vakt bahan kii thali main sindur, phool, chaaval ke dane, paan, supaani, nariyal, phool maala or mithai hona jaruri he
 According to a mythological belief about the beginning of such Bhai Dooj - Bhai Dooj, Yamuna had fasted for the long life of his brother Yamraj on this day and fed him the food of Annakoot
 katha ke anusaar yama devtaa ne apni bahan ko isi din darshan die the
 Yam's sister Yamuna was too distraught to meet her brother
 apane bhai ke darshan kar yamuna behad prasann hui
 Yamuna was happy and paid a lot of respect to her brother
 yama ne prasann hokar use vardaan diya ki is din agar bhai-bahan donon ek saath yamuna nadi main snaan karegein, to unhen mukti praapt hogi
 For this reason, bathing in this Yamuna river with brother and sister is of great importance
 iske alaava yama ne yamuna ne apane bhai se vachan liya ki aaj ke din har bhai ko apni bahan ke ghar janaa chahie
 Since then, the practice of celebrating Bhai Dooj has been going on

 The announcement of the punishment of RJD chief and former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in Deoghar fodder scam has been postponed again today
 lalu kii sajaa kaa elaan ab shuukravaar ko hoga
 Lalu was taken back from the court to jail
 ranchi kii vishesh CBI adaalat ko ye faisla pehle buudhvaar ko sunaanaa tha, lekin use taal diya gaya tha

 He said that there will be video conferencing from tomorrow, not from video today
 aapako bataa den ki buudhvaar ko lalu yadav samet maamle main anya doshi bhi sajaa ke elaan ke liye court pahunch gaye the
 But due to the death of the lawyers, other lawyers opposed the work, due to which the declaration of sentence was deferred
 is cese main lalu samet 16 logon ko aaj sajaa sunai jaani he
 The court found Lalu Yadav guilty of cheating, conspiracy and corruption under sections 420, 120B of the IPC and section 13 (2) of the PC Act
 is maamle main bihar ke purv siem jagannatha mishra or dhruv bhagat samet 6 logon ko bari kar diya gaya tha
 Lalu's lawyer will appeal to the court to sentence Lalu to a minimum sentence, while the CBI counsel said that this is a case related to corruption and in such a case, the court will be requested for maximum punishment

 Learned that jolly means humorous nature
 swasth majaak kar apane aas-paas ke maahaul ko khushnuma rakhane vaale log jolly kahe jate hai
 Sometimes someone would speak at home, the boy is of a jolly nature, and the heart would be happy
 phir aapkaa naam suna
 a few years ago, you were MLA Vijay Jolly
 phir pichley vidhansabha chunaav main shila dikshit ko haraane ke liye gol market vidhansabha pahunch gaye
 Your bet was half right
 khub prachaar mila
 i still remember that during the campaign you came to take Sheila's blessing
 laga ki are ye to acha raajnneetik shishtachar he
 The days of politics are remembered when people like Atal Bihari, Chandrashekhar, VP Singh and Rajiv Gandhi took care of this courtesy
 atal ke ilaaj kaa pataa chalane par rajeev unhen pratinidhimandal main shaamil kar america bhejte
 Used to get the best machine for Atal AIIMS when the VP dialysis was detected
 lekin nahin, main galat tha
 It seems that you are hungry for propaganda and for this you do actions like bahupis
 abhi pichley dinon aap hi the na, jo pyaaj kii tokari lekar shila dikshit se diwaali par milane gaye the
 Still got the same idea
 oho bada jolly leader he ye
 But what is this, today you have crossed the limit for publicity
 chalo pehle aapako or sabko bataaen ki aapane aakhir kiya kya
 Is a journalist
 shoma choudhary naam he unka
 Managing Editor of Tehelka
 kuch hafte pehle tak mahila adhikaron kii champion bani phirti thim
 Sometimes on a TV channel, sometimes in a fest
 magar jab se tahalaka ke sampadak tarun tejpal ke haathon santhaan kii hi ek mahila patrkaar ke yon utpeedan kaa maamla saamne aayaa, aapaki is masale par pratikriya saamne ai, hamen samaj aa gaya ki ek or kalai utar gai
 We all questioned Shoma's journalistic values
 aalochana kii or unhen vichaaron ke katghare main khadaa kiya
 After initial vigil on Tejpal's shameful act, the media also got a lot of coverage
 aise main tejpal to aaj nahin to kal police kii giraft main honge hi
 There has also been talk of police investigation of Shoma's role
 magar
 
 
 What you did 
 
 yaheen aakar hamaare virodh or aapaki badtamiji main bada fark ho jaataa he
 Goa police has been questioned by Shoma Chaudhary
 unhone police ke sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Answering media questions and not absconding
 unhen koi saman jari nahin hua he
 Then what do you do to become a Kotwal, Vijay Jolly
 apane chand samarthakon ko saath lekar aap shoma choudhary ke ghar gaye
 Reporters were tipped before the protest
 jab camere jute gaye, to lage tamaasha karne
 You do not even notice that the Shoma Chaudhary house you are abusing for a crime against a woman is also a woman and you are violating her dignity
 kaisaa jaahilon jaisaa bayaan he yah
 Where Shoma Chaudhary will be found by the people of Saket and the youth of Delhi, they will be caught and handed over to the police
 chashma to aap lagaate nahin
 So it must also be seen that when you and your companions were doing hooliganism there, Shoma had to go to her car under police protection
 to phir hawaale karne kii baat kahaan se aa gai
 He already is
 aapane kaalikh shoma choudhary kii nem plate par nahin, apane political kariyar par pot lee he
 And the speeches of this soot have also fallen on your party BJP
 isiilie to sushamaa swaraj ne fouran pratikriya dete hue aapke krity kii kadi ninda kii or alaakaman kii ore se karrwai kaa zikr bhi kiya
 But the damage is done
 abhi subah tak akhbaar or surkhiyaan is baat kii thim ki aapaki party ne doctor harshavardhan ko siem ke liye project kya kiya, bijepi kaa haal hi badal gaya
 The party now seems to be number one in almost every opinion poll
 harshavardhan bhi pehali pasand hai
 It is only today, when a smiling picture of him appeared on the front page of a big English newspaper
 vah ek maa ke god main baithe bachche kaa kaan jaanch rahe the
 Not as a leader, but as a doctor
 aap bhi unke paas jaaie
 Get the ears, eyes and nose treated
 lagata he ki raajnneetik sambhaavna or kalank ke bich kaa fark dekhne, soonghney or sunne kii kshamta kho baithe hai aap
 Jolly, we have no qualms in saying that your actions are shameful
 shoma par lage aarope agar sahi hai, to unhone nishchit hi galat kiya he
 The agency and intelligence are doing their work
 magar aapane shoma ke saath jo kiya, vah ek netaa ko katai shobhaa nahin detaa
 So mister jolly, you are not at all jolly
 ek mahila ke ghar par kaalikh potte or nautanki karte hue aapkaa sir shame se nahin jhukaa, par is desh kii raajnneetik jamaat or unhen chunane waalon kaa sir jarur jhuk gaya he

 raashtrapati samvidhan kii manyataon kaa rakhwala hota he
 Sati and Shiva's relationship was unbreakable
 bhagwaan bhole main basati thim sati or shakti ke hriday main rahete the shiv
 But after the fire of Sati, when Shiva was wandering in the whole universe with Sati's body, where Sati's heart fell, there was a temple of Mata Amba
 sati mata kaa hriday jahaan gira, vahiin par bana sabase pavitra shaktipeeth
 It is also a mythological belief that nand-yashoda had got Lord Krishna shaved here
 bhagwaan ram or lakshmana, sita mata kii khoj karte hue yaheen se gujarey the or yaheen mata ne unhen ravan ko maarane kaa baan bhi diya tha
 Not only this, Valmiki Muni started writing Ramayana with this taphobhoomi
 bhakt dete hai maa ko nyotrambaji main bhado poornima kaa khaas mahatv he kyonki isi din se navaratri ke liye bhakt maa ko apane ghar aane kaa nyauta dete hai
 Devotees bring here the flag of Bhagwati and offer it to the mother's temple, call the mother to her home
 ye ambe kii mahima hi he ki yahaan aanevaala koi bhakt khaali haath nahin lautataa
 But the most special thing about this temple is that here in the sanctum sanctorum, instead of the idol of the mother, the yantra is worshiped
 amba devi kaa yantra gupt rakhaa jaataa he, jise khule main dekhnaa bhi nishedh he
 Priests worship it with blindfolds
 shaktipeeth ambaji main navaratri utsav kii shuruyaat bhado kii poornima se hoti he or navaratri ke dauraan isaki chata dekhte hi banati he
 This is the reason why millions of devotees walk here with the Ghosh of 'jai Jai Ambe' to knock in the court of the mother
 amba maa ke ek bhakt jitubhai bhi hai jinke jivan main maa ne wo chamatkaar kar dikhaaya jisaki unhen ummid tak nahin thi
 For 20 years, her sister's voice was heard and she decided to offer Shraddha Suman by attending her mother's court
 wo lakhon bhaktaganon ke saath maa kaa jayakaara lagaate hue amba mata ke darshanon ke liye nikal pade
 While chanting 'jai Jai Ambe', gulal was draped over the body, and lakhs of devotees wrapped on their mother's feet, Bhado walked on foot to reach the temple of Amba Mata on the full moon day
 desh ke alag-alag rajyon se aae lakhon bhaktagan haathon main dhwaja-pataakaa liye hue, maa ke bhajanon main leen hokar maa ke darshanon ke liye kadam badhaate hai
 Whether there are blisters on the feet or fatigue of long journey, these devotees, anxious to see the mother, do not worry about anything
 sabhi bhakt apni choti-choti tukadiyaan banaakar aate hai or saath main maa amba kaa rath bhi laate hai
 When the devotees reach the temple after a long padyatra, the atmosphere is no less than a celebration
 garba kii taal par jhuumate hue, hothon par maa ke bhajan or ‘jai jai ambe’ ke buland naare lagaakar bhaktajan apni hajri lagane maa ke darbar tak panhuchate hai
 Ambaji Shaktipeeth is one of the 52 Shaktipeeths of the country, which is also mentioned in the scriptures
 kaha jaataa he kii ambaji ke is mandir kii jagah par sati mata kaa hriday gira tha or yahaan par shaktipeeth kaa nirmaan hua
 Here, adornment and worship are also done in a special way
 savere balaroop kii, dopaher ko yauvan swaroop kii or shaam ko praudh swaroop kii puja hoti he
 The miracle of this puja archana is that no one has returned empty handed from here till today
 ambaji main bhado poornima par paidal chalakar aane ke saath-saath dhwaja pataakaa lekar aane kii bhi vishesh parampara rahi he
 Devotees express their devotion by offering small flags and 52 yards long flags to the Mother's temple
 amba mata ke mandir main paidal chalakar aanevaale sabhi shraddhalu maa amba kii aarti ke saath judane ko apana saubhaahgya maanate hai or aarti ke darshan karne par hi shraddhalu apni yatra ko safal maanate hai

 pakistan media kaa kahana he ki bharat kii ‘nijee aadhyatmik yatra’ par gaye raashtrapati asif ali zaradaari kaa daura mezbaan desh ke is ishaare ke saath sampann hua ki ‘hindustan kaa dil jeetne ke liye abhi or mehnat kerani hogi
 The Pakistani media, however, also wrote that the visit should set the stage for the two sides to resolve controversial issues such as the investigation into the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks
 sabhi pakistani akhabaaron ke pehle panne par muskuraate hue jaradaari kii vah tasviir chhapi he jisamen vah pradhanmantri manmohan singh se haath mila rahe hai
 Reports published about his meeting with Singh during the President's one-day visit to India on Sunday said that the Indian leader has accepted Zardari's invitation to visit Pakistan
 duusari ore jaradaari ne pakistan kii dharti par based aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf adhik karrwai kii bharat kii maang par hami bhari he
 The Express Tribune has written in its head, 'under the shadow of JUD, Singh accepted Pakistan's invitation
 ’ udhar prabhaavshaalee don dainik ne apni report kaa shishark lagaaya he, ‘pyaar paane ke liye mehnat karo, dilli main jaradaari ko sabak
 On his visit to Zardari, The Dawn has stated that the President had enjoyed a 'lajiz Bhoj' before the Jiyarrat at the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, but his one-day private visit to India concluded with the host's gesture that Now they will have to work harder to get the love of India
 ’da express tribune ne apni report main kaha he ki singh ne jaradaari kaa paak yatra kaa nimantran sweekaar kar liya he lekin saath hi nai dilli ne apni yah maang dohraayi he ki ‘islamabad 2008 ke mumbai hamale ke doshiyon ko sajaa de
 Which is a clear reference to Hafiz Saeed, the head of Jamaat ud Dawa
 ’di news ne ‘ek nijee yatra’ sheershak vaale apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki pichley saat saalon main pakistan ke kisi rashtradhyaksh kii yah pehali bharat yatra thi
 It has also been written that it was not easy to arrange a meeting between the leaders of two countries who usually negotiate the margins during international diplomatic events
 sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he ki yah yatra pichley saal donon deshon ke vyavsaayik samudaayon ke bich kaaphi satarkta ke saath shuru hue kaarobaari rishton kaa dayera vyapak karne ke makasad se kii gayi jo aapasi vishwaas bahaali upayon ko majbootee pradaan karne kaa hissaa he
 Although it was not explicitly mentioned
 da news or pakistan today ne apane sampadakiyon main jaradaari kii is yatra par aae kharch ko lekar desh kii bheetar ho rahi aalochana ko bhi jagah di he
 The News and Pakistan Today have written that a large delegation along with Zardari visited India, including his son and Pakistan People's Party chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who was involved in the tour despite not being in any official position
 media ne likhaa he ki raashtrapati ke pratinidhimandal kaa aakaar or uski awajahi par hua kharch kuch sawaal khadey karata he ki kya vastav main yah ‘nijee’ yatra thi
 The Daily Times wrote in an editorial titled 'spiritual Journey' that Zardari's visit should set the stage for resolving controversial issues between the two countries, including the investigation of the Mumbai attacks and the issue of river water sharing
 pakistan today, da express tribune or daily times ne likhaa he ki jaradaari kii yatra kii purv sandhya par siachin glacier main himaskhalan main 124 pakistani sainikon samet 135 log dab gaye hai
 The media has called for the liberation of the world's highest altitude cold war zone

 Instead of attempting to be too ambitious, the media wrote, the government cautiously took small steps towards peace, moving inch by inch through business and regular high level meetings
 ’isamen likhaa gaya he ki singh ke saath jaradaari kii baithak ‘is baat kaa ek or sanket he ki donon desh sthaayee shanti sthapit karne kii ore majbootee se bad rahe hai’ or donon desh ‘bhaagyashaalee hai ki donon ke paas aise netaa hai jo shanti prakriya ke liye patibaddh hai lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki chaaron ore khatra nahin mandara rahaa he

 5 Star Artists: Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhu Devadirector: Remo d'suzamasala is a different thing to film, and it is different to focus on one art
 vishay dance ho or jameen bollywood ho to kadam or bhi phoonk-foonkkar rakhane chahie
 As Remo d'souza did in the first part of 'ABCD' (any Buddy Can Dance)
 lekin is baar remo usee syndrome kaa shikaar ho gaye jiskaa adhiktar bollywood diarector ho jate hai
 bling Bling
 sikval hit ho gaya to agali film main bade sitaron kaa jalawaa or motaa bajet
 Here the matter starts to get entangled, the fun of the big platform seems to be gritty and in this way the film of about two and a half hours looks like a finale of a dance reality show
 jise dekhakar lagata he ki pehali film dil se banaai thi to vahiin'abisidi-2'box offis ke haathon majaboor hokar safalataa ke liye gadhi gai he
 How much Damvarun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor are part of a dance group in the story and they take part in a match 
 mukaable ke dauraan ve kisi or group kaa act dikhaa dete hai
 Slander is stained
 samaaj jeena muhaal kar detaa he
 Varun then decides to try his hand at a Las Vegas hip hop bout
 prabhu deva aate hai
 Then a trip to Las Vegas
 remo kahani ke jariye baandhakar rakhane main chook jate hai, or aisa lagata bhi he ki ek koreographer hone ke naate ve jald se jald dance par pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 The length of the film is also high, and the same thing starts to bother
 abisidi bollywood main dance johnor ko main stream main laane kii kaabiletarif koshish thi, vahiin yah film sirf uskaa vistaar jaisi hi najar aati he
 Which cannot connect
 film diarectaron ko yah baat samajni chahie ki agar film do ghante se zyada ho to uski kahani damdaar honi chahie nahin to audiyans ko itnaa samay mil jaataa he ki vah film main kahani dhundne lagata he
 Star Appelvarun Dhawan's dance is good
 suresh ke role ke liye thik pasand the
 But on the acting front they still miss the dialog delivery
 beshak sicks pack aibs achche hai, dance acha he, ab varun ko thodaa acting par janaa chahie
 Shraddha Kapoor looks good, but she can do a little bit of acting
 unhone dance kii acchhee koshish kii he, lekin profeshnal dancers unke ird-gird hote hai, isliye ve thodi feeki pad jaati hai
 Prabhu Deva is good
 ve mjedaar lagate hai
 It is better to see more than what the rest of Vishnu says about Sir
 raghav juaal, dharmesh,lauren gotlibor punit tivi ke jariye kaaphi pahchaan bana chuke hai
 But don't act with them
 kamai kii batfilmi duniya kaa yah usul he ki ek hifilmake saath diarector or actor ke tevar badal jate hai
 While ABCD was Remo's first attempt at a dance film, by ABCD-2, he had become a big name as a director
 is tarah unhen nami stars kii jarurat thi
 If the film was to be taken abroad by some excuse, it was taken to Las Vegas
 phir thridi factor to shuru se hi he
 In this way ABCD where about 12-15 crores
 main ban gai thi vahiin abisidi-2 kaa bajet takreeban 60 karod ru
 Being told is tarah unhone kamjor kahani par bada daanv khelaa he
 Dance lovers can enjoy it but the story lovers will be disappointed

 police gave this information

 pariyojna ke vitt poshan ke bare main puche jane par gadakari ne kaha ki kendriya sadak kosh se 2
 37 lakh crores will come while 2
 05 lakh karod rupee bazaar se jutaaye jaaenge
 Apart from this, 34 thousand crore rupees will be raised from monetization of highway projects and 60 thousand rupees from budgetary allocation
 gadakari ne kaha ki iske alaava or bhi kuch pariyojnaayen hai jinka lakshya dakshin asia tathaa asian ke deshon ke saath sampark badhanaa he
 (from input language) haal main kai aisi ajeebogareeb ghatnaayen saamne ai hai, jise jaanakar kisi ke rongte khadey ho jaaen
 Recently, a similar strange incident occurred in which a wife cut off her husband's private part ie 'penis'
 ajeeb baat ye he ki patni kuch dinon pehle bhi apane pati ke pennish ko kaat chuki thi, jise doctoron ne surgery ke jariye jod diya tha
 But the wife was so angry that she again attacked her husband's private part
 aisi ghatnaayen duniya ke kai deshon se saamne ai hai
 But in the midst of all this, the big question is what mental and physical sufferings the men have to suffer through such an incident
 kya aise mard waapas saamaanya jivan bitaa sakate hai? kya aisi ghatnaon ke shikaar mard kii sex life samaanya ho sakati he yaa phir jinke privet part ko surgery kii sahaayta se joda jaataa he, unhen kis tarah kii dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Some basic questions like this have been tried here
 kitna dard he is chot mecondkosh ko hataae bina pennish ko hataaya janaa peedit ke liye maansik pratadna jaisaa he
 In such a situation, the victims become victims of sexual frustration
 bina pennish ke mard bina goli kii bandook kii tarah he
 In such a situation, men are unable to satisfy their partner
 surgery se guzar chuke mardon ko bike chalaane main dikkat jaisi samasyaon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 What are the remedies in case of such a situation, according to the Urologist Professor Raj Prasad, to emerge from such injuries, it is necessary to see on which part the injury is more
 pennish ke nason ko dobaaraa jodna behad hi mushkil kaam he, kyonki pennish main maujuud corporal tissue behad hi sookshm hote hai
 Corporal tissues help erection
 kya kate hue pennish ko dobaaraa joda ja saktaa heexparts bataate hai ki kate hue pennish ko surgery kii madad se dobaaraa joda ja saktaa he
 But it is very complicated
 kai maamalon main ye safal nahin ho paata
 Even after surgery, the penis does not work as before
 ek chini shodh ke mutabik, 50 marijon kii pennish ko surgery dwaara joda gaya, jisamen sirf ek marij hi puri tarah swasth sambhog ke liye taiyaar ho paaya
 If the penis cannot be added, then in which cases the penis cannot be added back with the help of surgery, in such cases, the doctor creates a new penis
 iske liye doctor peedit vyakti ke hi maance or tissue kii madad lete hai
 But such a penis cannot be considered right
 peedit sex kar saktaa he kyaaye sabase ahm sawaal he jo aamtaur par peedit ke dimag main aata he
 According to a Chinese research, this is not entirely possible
 kai maamalon main peedit vyakti ke liye sex karnaa sambhav nahin hota
 What will be the problem in urinating? This is a big problem for a person who is struggling with such incidents
 ye bada sawaal he ki bina pennish kaa shaks peshaab kaise karegaa
 Experts believe that if the penis has been rebuilt, the afflicted person can stand and urinate like a normal man
 lekin agar pennish thik tareeke se joda yaa banaaya nahin ja sakaa he, to doctors oparation kii madad se peshaab kii nalee ko andkosh ke jariye baahar nikaal dete hai
 After this happens, what the victim is called is that the person slowly starts living a normal life
 lekin aisi ghatana se ubarne main peedit ko kaaphi vakt lag saktaa he
 Many times the victim also goes into deep shock
 behatar yahi he ki aise vyakti se saamaanya tareeke se hi pesh aayaa jaae, taaki use kisi tarah kii kuntha kaa saamana naa karnaa pade

 Kamal Nath said that i built the biggest Hanuman temple in the state in my area but never promoted it

 On the poster of Shivbhakt Rahul, Narmadabhakt Congress, Kamal Nath said that we are not putting up such posters but even if our workers are putting up, this is their sentiment but why is the BJP objecting to it
 kya bijepi ne hindu dharm kaa theka le rakhaa he jisaki wo holcel distributor banakar baith gai he
 Kamal Nath said that even today when i go to the temple, the media reaches there but we have always been going to the temple, what is new in this

 ) The Garhwaghat Ashram is in Varanasi
 is ashram ke anuyaayiyon kii sankhya karodon main he, jinamein zyaadaatar dalit or pichde samaaj, khaskar yadavon kii hai
 The main reason for this is that this ashram is considered to be the descendants of Lord Krishna
 lihaaja yahaan par samay-samay par lagbhag sabhi partiyon ke netaaon kaa aana janaa laga rahaa
 Not only this, the faith of many big politicians is also attached to this bench
 rahul gandhi se lekar rajnath singh jaise netaa yahaan aa chuke hai
 sp's patron Mulayam Singh Yadav has been coming here often, during the 2017 assembly elections, PM Narendra Modi reached Garhwaghat Ashram for the first time and started his campaign campaign from here
 or ab ek baar phir uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi aditya nath yahaan par apni dastak de rahe hai
 The BJP, which is struggling to repeat the results of the 2014 elections in the state, has chosen this path with a lot of thought
 yadavon kii sabase badi gaddi par bijepi ke sheersh netaaon kaa aana mahaj ittepak nahin he
 Through this, the BJP wants to give a message to the Yadav society
 bijepi chaahati he ki obisi varg main sabase badi haisiyat rakhane vaale un yadavon ko apni ore joda jaae jo ab tak samaajawaadee party ke voter maane jate hai
 Since SP and BSP were fighting separately in 2014 and BJP easily managed to get the Dalits on their side, this time the situation is different
 SP-BSP are not only together but the Yadav vote is also visible like this BJP is also trying to woo Yadav votes with Dalits so that SP-BSP alliance can be affected
 iskaa kitna asar yadav voton par padegaa yah to nahin kah sakate lekin yogi se mulaakaat ke baad gadhwaghat ashram ke sant sharnanand ne rashtrawaad par jor dete huve apni baat jarur kahi
 During the interaction with the media, he said that for every countryman, the country is necessary first
 hindustan hinduvadi raashtra he or isaki asmita kii raksha karnaa hamaara kartavya he
 This talk of Swami Sharanand may excite the BJP as it is believed that the Yadav society stands up at the sound of the ashram
 aise main swami sharnanand ke rashtrawaad kii baat bijepi ke liye mufeed baithti he
 Yogi had not only visited the ashram during his visit to Varanasi, but had also reached the house of Kanhaiya Lal Yadav, former Varanasi mayor, to take his ploy
 vahaan pahunchakar bhi unhone yadav samaaj ko ek sandesh dene kii koshish kii he
 But is it so easy, be it the Modi government of the Center or the Yogi government of the state, Yadav is marginalized
 yogi mantrimandal main sirf girish yadav ko rajyamantri kaa ohada hasil hua he
 Apart from this, the leader of Yadav society does not have any important post
 yahi nahin transfar, posting ko lekar bhi yadav samaaj ke log yogi sarkaar se khafa hai
 They feel that they are being discriminated against because of their proximity to the SP
 aise main kya yadav birdari bijepi ko gale lagaaegi ye bada sawaal he baavjood iske bijepi yadav maton ko apni taraf karne ke liye purvanchal kii raajnneeti main gadhwaghat ashram ko ek nai prayogshaala ke taur par dekh rahi he
 Sources are also saying that the BJP is trying to become a member of the Yadav community on the guidelines of the ashram as the proponent of PM Modi

 The police have now thought of questioning Varun in custody
 police kaa maananaa he ki kanda kii pareshaan hokar khudakushi karne se pehle geetika varun se mili thi
 The police also believe that Geetika had told Varun about Kanda's antics
 police varun ke i-mail acount ke bare main pataa laga chuki he or ab unki jaanch kii ja rahi he

 Likewise, IMF and World Bank do not have much meaning without proper role of India
 blair ne kaha ki duniya kii ek pramukh shakti kii haisiyat se bharat maang karegaa or apana sthaan hasil karegaa
 But after this, Blair said a concise statement, but we should know that with strength the responsibility will also increase
 blair ne kaha ki log aapke daravaaje par na sirf apni raay dene aaenge, balki uttar bhi jaanane aaenge

 online pariksha ke centre hote hai jahaan pahunchane ke liye chal kar janaa hota he
 Examination centers are called online even when students have to travel 1500 to 2000 km to reach these centers
 ek tarah se yah online or ofline kaa mixchar hua
 Dalmanth Examination System
 aapako pataa he ki railway kii assitant loko payalat or technician kii pariksha 9 agast se hone vaali he jisamen 47 lakh 56 hazaar parikshaarthi hissaa lene vaale hai
 On Friday, a large number of students contacted us that their center has been given 1500 km away and they do not have the capacity to spend 2000 rupees
 aap agar rail mantri or rail mantralay ke twitor handle par jaakar dekhenge to aisi shikayaton kii baadh ai hui he jisamen chaatr rail mantri se gidgidaa rahe hai ki unka centre dur nahin rakhaa jaae varanaa imtahaan chhot jayega
 First you see what the Ministry of Railways has responded to this problem after three days
 unke aadhikarik jawaab ke anusaar is pariksha ke liye 47 lakh se adhik abhyarthiyon ne aavedan kiya he
 Out of these, about 34 lakh or more than 71% applicants have been given examination centers within 200 km
 vishesh rup se ullekhneey yah he ki 99% divyangon va mahilaon ko 200 kilometre ke andar pariksha centre die gaye hai
 Similarly, about 500% applicants have been accommodated within a distance of about 83% within 500 km
 or keval 17% aavedakon ko 500 kilometre se adhik duuri ke centre aavantit hue hai
 In its press release, the railways gave the number up to 40 lakhs, but only the percentage of center people with distance of more than 500 kilometers
 aise chaatr sirf 17 pratishat hai
 This is 17 percent, about 8 lakh
 8 lakh chaatr pareshaan hai ki unhen katihaar se telugana janaa he, bangaleru janaa he jodhpur janaa he
 Is it a low number, it is normal to send 8 lakh students so far that many of them are not in a position to cut tickets
 yah kisi vyavastha he ki 8 lakh logon ko 2000 kimi kii yatra kerani pade or 40 lakh logon ko 500 kimi se kam kii yatra kerani pade to kya yah sarkaar kii taraf se barabari kii vyavastha hui
 Railways has said that the number of applicants from some states is much more than the capacity of the examination centers available there
 jaise bihar se 9 lakh, uttar pradesh se 9
 5 lakhs and 4 from Rajasthan
 5 lakh aavedak hai
 These states do not have the number of suitable examination centers with CCTV, frisking, metal detector, etc
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki in teen rajyon ke jin abhyarthiyon ne shuruyaat main aavedan kiya he unhen nikat ke centre mili hai, jabaki jinhone baad main aavedan kiya he unako dur ke centre aavantit hue hai
 The last date for the examination form was till 31 March
 kya is dauraan bhare gaye farm ko pehle yaa ant main bharne ke aadhaar par antar kiya ja saktaa he
 Railways has said that it was taken care that they should be allotted examination centers in the main cities with better traffic facility
 kya railway ne vaaki iskaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 Tirupati is the center of students of Saran district of Bihar
 ek chaatr se baat kii aap bhi uske train kaa kaarykram sun lijie
 We have named them Mohan for convenience
 mohan kii pariksha 21 agast ko he
 If he has to take the Ernakulam Express from Patna to Tirupati then he will have to take the ticket on August 14
 kyonki patna se ernakulam express saptaah main sirf mangalvaar ko chalati he
 If his examination is on Tuesday, then he has to plan afresh
 vah 18 agast ko siwan se patna ke liye nikalegaa, bas se 8-9 ghante lag jate hai
 The evening of August 18 will leave for Patna from Kolkata
 kolkata pahunch kar 8 ghante tirupati ke liye train kaa intazaar karegaa jo ravivaar ko chalegi
 It will leave Kolkata on 19 August and reach it on 20 August i
e
 8 pm on Monday night
 is tarah mohan 37 ghanta safar main rahegaa or platform par 8 ghanta intazaar karegaa
 In total, it will take 45 hours to travel between August 18 and August 20
 general bogi kaa tikat liya he, ek taraf se kiraaya 1200 ke kareeb lagegaa
 If you look in this way, it does not seem correct that the claim of Railways is that the students have been allotted examination centers in the main cities with better traffic facility
 train der ho gai to uskaa tanaav alag se jhelegaa
 Mohan's father does farming
 teen din or teen se chaar hazaar kharch kar pariksha centre pahunchnaa mohan jaise lakhon chaatro ke liye aasaan nahin he
 According to the railway itself, the number of such students is 8 lakh
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne abhi tak in chaatro ke liye rail mantri se baat nahin kii he
 The railways have understood that this problem is only from Bihar, so they have given the answer about Bihar
 jabaki hamen upi or rajasthan ke chaatro kii bhi shikaayatein mili hai
 Out of total 26502 vacancies, only 2292 vacancies are from Bihar while 24210 vacancies are from other regions of India
 bihar ke abhyarthiyon ne in 2292 rictiyon ke atirikt desh ke anya rail bhartee board kii rictiyon hetu bhi aavedan kiya he isliye unhen uplabdhta ke anusaar anya rajyon ke pariksha kendron main bhi aavantit kiya gaya he
 Online examination should at least be within your state
 9 lakh chaatr agar is tarah se safar kar pariksha dene pahunchenge to un par kya beetegi
 On Saturday and Sunday a large number of students kept calling us
 ve rone lage
 They started saying that they are very poor, their examination will be missed, for which they have been strangling for four years
 haddi galaana matlab pariksha ke liye mehnat kar rahe hai
 Many people said that everybody has 2000 to 3000 rupees
 yah bataata he ki ham logon ke prati kitne asamvedansheel ho gaye hai
 We talked to many students
 ek chaatr ke pitaaji atm main guard hai
 Would they have got so much money that the son could spend four thousand to go through the examination
 bahut se chaatr tution padhaakar kaam chalaate hai
 Many parents earn only seven to eight thousand a month
 inke liye 3000 rupaya bahut he
 In Ara town many students come from village to village to do group study
 kai chaatr 8 se 10 kimi cycle chalaa kar yahaan aate hai taaki kiraaye kaa 20 rupaya batch jaae
 If they were children of a rich household, mosquitoes would not have gathered in the ground for preparation after getting bitten by a fly
 yah rewelganj chhapra kii tasviir he
 Here too, students come from several km and do group studies
 7 se 10 kimi cycle chalaakar aana or padhanaa
 The financial condition of all of them is not such that they can spend five to five thousand to give exams
 aapako yakeen na ho to is neeli kameez ko dekhie
 This is the ATM guard shirt which gets 3500 a month
 bataaiye ki iskaa baccha 4000 kharch kar bangaloru ja saktaa he
 Think of one thing, how much stress he will have at this time
 do din kii yatra he use tikat nahin mila he
 This is a picture of some houses, from which you can guess which houses the students come from which are going to take the railway examination
 kisi ko tikat nahin mil rahaa he to kisi ko reserveshan nahin mil rahaa he
 At least the spectators and mps of the metropolis should understand why the money is being put on the students of poor houses to give their examinations
 main to ganit main kamazor hum magar shivank ne hisaab lagaaya ki 4 lakh bhi imtahaan dene nahin ja sake to 100 rupye farm bharne ke hisaab 16 karod kii kamai ho sakati he
 Eight lakh students have been troubled
 ye sankhya railway ke hisaab se he
 Many students whose forms have been rejected for strange reasons, they cry by calling that their four years have been wasted
 railway ne aaj jo press relij jari kii he usamen kahin bhi nahin likhaa he ki pariksha centre badalane ke vikalp die jaaenge
 So students should not pay attention to the information here and there
 abhi tak yahi soochna he ki railway ne unka centre badalane kaa koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Sudeep Samant has tweeted to the Railway Minister that he is from Bangalore but his center has been given to Kolkata
 yah kaise ho gaya he
 In this second tweet, Avinash has told the Railway Minister that he lives in Bangalore but the center of the examination has been given to Bhopal
 kripaya centre badalane kii suvidha dijie
 Krishna Kumar of Chandigarh has tweeted to the Railway Minister that his center has been given 1600 km away to Kolkata
 saurabh singh ne twit kiya he ki bhubaneshwar ke chaatr kaa centre gujarat padaa he, acha hota neuyark bhej dete
 Amritsar has given the center of Kumar Ashok of Rajasthan Sikar
 naveen ne twit kiya he ki dilli ke rahane vaale hai magar urisa centre padaa he
 What does online mean isliye is samasya ko bihar kendrit bataanaa thik nahin lagata he
 What does it mean to give Bhopal to a Bangalore student? chandigarh vaale ko kolkata dene kaa kya matlab he
 If Shivank had not helped so much, there would not have been many questions about the answer of the Railways
 railway agar apane faisle par kaayam he to uski apni samaj hogi, magar jo pareshaani ham tak pahunch rahi he usase hamen yahi lagata he ki garib chaatro ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa he
 After four-four years, the opportunity has come to give examination and that too, he has to leave the house for a week before giving the examination, then he should take notice of his problems
 kam se kam rail mantri ko apana twitor handle check kar lenaa chahie
 Not only this, the railway examiners are asking when they will get Rs 400 back for those who had filled the Rs 500 form
 aapako yaad hoga ki pehle farm kii keemat 500 rakhi gai thi lekin jab hamane prime time main sawaal uthaaya ki iees ke imtahaan vaale upieses kii farm 100 rupee kaa he or group di ke imtahaan kaa farm 500 kaa to yah ninsaphi he
 The Railways immediately reduced the rupees to 100 rupees and said that the remaining 400 rupees would be refunded
 aaj tak waapas nahin hue
 We told the financial situation of those students so that both the officers and spectators sitting in Rail Bhavan can see who takes the railway examination
 ve kahaan rahete hai, unke pariwaron kii aarthik banaavat kisi he
 Radha Kund railway station is near Mathura
 ek maheenaa pehle yah stesan chaalu hua tha
 This station was built at a cost of 15 crores but could not last even 30 days
 barish kaa bahaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he magar is hisaab se to is desh main kya kya nahin dhans janaa chahie barish ke dinon main
 Should the station sink within a month, is it normal? chota sa stesan he magar iskaa farsh dhans gaya he
 The entire floor of the bench where the bench is kept is sunken
 seedhiyaan dhans gai hai
 The walls have cracked
 platform dhans jaae aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 How much material the contractor must have made
 barish se dhansa he to kya use nahin pataa tha ki bharat main barish hoti he
 See photos of the walls inside the station
 sillen he or daraaren aa gai hai
 Our colleague Mukul Gautam went to Radhakund station
 sthaneey media main aane ke baad flatform par dhansi hui farsh ko ukhaad kar phir se kaam hone laga tha
 What Mukesh showed were pictures of work after the sunset
 tippaniyan 1400 students of Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia have been performing since 23 July
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki inke saath dhokhaa hua he
 At the time of admission, on the website, the prospectus wrote that this course is full time
 2014-15, 2015-17 or 2016-17 kaa teen saal isi mugaalate main guzar gaya ki hamane to bachaler of ejineering main daakhila liya he or degree milegi
 But in the last year it is said that their course is part time from AICTE
 chaatro kii baat sahi he ki phir inhen uniwarsity kii taraf se galat soochna kyon di gai ki course phul time he
 a part time Bachelor of Engineering degree is not considered a degree and is not recognized anywhere
 ek tarah se in chaatro kaa bhavishya barbaad hone ke kagaar par pahunch gaya he
 Due to their performance, the entrance examination for new admission has been canceled, but these students are looking for a way to save their lives
 7 dinon se lagaataar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Police has also been called on campus
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki jab tak inaki maang puri nahin hogi, phul time degree nahin milegi, tab tak ek ek chaatr bhukh hadtaal karne lagenge
 The students say they did not know that there is part time
 jab ek senior kii niyukti BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD main hui tab unhen naukari nahin di gai kyonki kaha gaya ki aapkaa course AICTE se part time manzur he
 The students started asking questions to the university
 jab jawaab nahin mila to andolan par utar aae
 The lives of 1400 students are at stake
 yahaan par paanch branch he jiske liye jamiya alag se pravesh pariksha leti he
 This course has been going on for many years, but now problems have started especially since 2005 when the court had canceled the recognition of part time course
 jo chaatr puraane hai or naukari kar rahe hai unhen bhi naukari main isaki degree ke kaaran dikkat aa rahi he

 Not only this, the railway examiners are asking when they will get Rs 400 back for those who had filled the Rs 500 form

 a part time Bachelor of Engineering degree is not considered a degree and is not recognized anywhere

 Due to their performance, the entrance examination for new admission has been canceled, but these students are looking for a way to save their lives

 In its press release, the railways gave the number up to 40 lakhs, but only the percentage of center people with distance of more than 500 kilometers
 aise chaatr sirf 17 pratishat hai
 This is 17 percent, about 8 lakh
 8 lakh chaatr pareshaan hai ki unhen katihaar se telugana janaa he, bangaleru janaa he jodhpur janaa he
 Is it a low number, it is normal to send 8 lakh students so far that many of them are not in a position to cut tickets
 yah kisi vyavastha he ki 8 lakh logon ko 2000 kimi kii yatra kerani pade or 40 lakh logon ko 500 kimi se kam kii yatra kerani pade to kya yah sarkaar kii taraf se barabari kii vyavastha hui
 Railways has said that the number of applicants from some states is much more than the capacity of the examination centers available there
 jaise bihar se 9 lakh, uttar pradesh se 9
 5 lakhs and 4 from Rajasthan
 5 lakh aavedak hai
 These states do not have the number of suitable examination centers with CCTV, frisking, metal detector, etc
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki in teen rajyon ke jin abhyarthiyon ne shuruyaat main aavedan kiya he unhen nikat ke centre mili hai, jabaki jinhone baad main aavedan kiya he unako dur ke centre aavantit hue hai
 The last date for the examination form was till 31 March
 kya is dauraan bhare gaye farm ko pehle yaa ant main bharne ke aadhaar par antar kiya ja saktaa he
 Railways has said that it was taken care that they should be allotted examination centers in the main cities with better traffic facility
 kya railway ne vaaki iskaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 Tirupati is the center of students of Saran district of Bihar

 We have named them Mohan for convenience
 mohan kii pariksha 21 agast ko he
 If he has to take the Ernakulam Express from Patna to Tirupati then he will have to take the ticket on August 14
 kyonki patna se ernakulam express saptaah main sirf mangalvaar ko chalati he
 If his examination is on Tuesday, then he has to plan afresh
 vah 18 agast ko siwan se patna ke liye nikalegaa, bas se 8-9 ghante lag jate hai
 The evening of August 18 will leave for Patna from Kolkata
 kolkata pahunch kar 8 ghante tirupati ke liye train kaa intazaar karegaa jo ravivaar ko chalegi
 It will leave Kolkata on 19 August and reach it on 20 August i
e
 8 pm on Monday night
 is tarah mohan 37 ghanta safar main rahegaa or platform par 8 ghanta intazaar karegaa
 In total, it will take 45 hours to travel between August 18 and August 20
 general bogi kaa tikat liya he, ek taraf se kiraaya 1200 ke kareeb lagegaa
 If you look in this way, it does not seem correct that the claim of Railways is that the students have been allotted examination centers in the main cities with better traffic facility
 train der ho gai to uskaa tanaav alag se jhelegaa
 Mohan's father does farming
 teen din or teen se chaar hazaar kharch kar pariksha centre pahunchnaa mohan jaise lakhon chaatro ke liye aasaan nahin he
 According to the railway itself, the number of such students is 8 lakh
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne abhi tak in chaatro ke liye rail mantri se baat nahin kii he
 The railways have understood that this problem is only from Bihar, so they have given the answer about Bihar
 jabaki hamen upi or rajasthan ke chaatro kii bhi shikaayatein mili hai
 Out of total 26502 vacancies, only 2292 vacancies are from Bihar while 24210 vacancies are from other regions of India
 bihar ke abhyarthiyon ne in 2292 rictiyon ke atirikt desh ke anya rail bhartee board kii rictiyon hetu bhi aavedan kiya he isliye unhen uplabdhta ke anusaar anya rajyon ke pariksha kendron main bhi aavantit kiya gaya he
 Online examination should at least be within your state
 9 lakh chaatr agar is tarah se safar kar pariksha dene pahunchenge to un par kya beetegi
 On Saturday and Sunday a large number of students kept calling us
 ve rone lage
 They started saying that they are very poor, their examination will be missed, for which they have been strangling for four years
 haddi galaana matlab pariksha ke liye mehnat kar rahe hai
 Many people said that everybody has 2000 to 3000 rupees
 yah bataata he ki ham logon ke prati kitne asamvedansheel ho gaye hai
 We talked to many students
 ek chaatr ke pitaaji atm main guard hai
 Would they have got so much money that the son could spend four thousand to go through the examination
 bahut se chaatr tution padhaakar kaam chalaate hai
 Many parents earn only seven to eight thousand a month
 inke liye 3000 rupaya bahut he
 In Ara town many students come from village to village to do group study
 kai chaatr 8 se 10 kimi cycle chalaa kar yahaan aate hai taaki kiraaye kaa 20 rupaya batch jaae
 If they were children of a rich household, mosquitoes would not have gathered in the ground for preparation after getting bitten by a fly
 yah rewelganj chhapra kii tasviir he
 Here too, students come from several km and do group studies
 7 se 10 kimi cycle chalaakar aana or padhanaa
 The financial condition of all of them is not such that they can spend five to five thousand to give exams
 aapako yakeen na ho to is neeli kameez ko dekhie

 This is a picture of some houses, from which you can guess which houses the students come from which are going to take the railway examination
 kisi ko tikat nahin mil rahaa he to kisi ko reserveshan nahin mil rahaa he
 At least the spectators and mps of the metropolis should understand why the money is being put on the students of poor houses to give their examinations
 main to ganit main kamazor hum magar shivank ne hisaab lagaaya ki 4 lakh bhi imtahaan dene nahin ja sake to 100 rupye farm bharne ke hisaab 16 karod kii kamai ho sakati he
 Eight lakh students have been troubled

 Many students whose forms have been rejected for strange reasons, they cry by calling that their four years have been wasted
 railway ne aaj jo press relij jari kii he usamen kahin bhi nahin likhaa he ki pariksha centre badalane ke vikalp die jaaenge
 So students should not pay attention to the information here and there

 Sudeep Samant has tweeted to the Railway Minister that he is from Bangalore but his center has been given to Kolkata

 In this second tweet, Avinash has told the Railway Minister that he lives in Bangalore but the center of the examination has been given to Bhopal

 What does online mean isliye is samasya ko bihar kendrit bataanaa thik nahin lagata he
 What does it mean to give Bhopal to a Bangalore student? chandigarh vaale ko kolkata dene kaa kya matlab he
 If Shivank had not helped so much, there would not have been many questions about the answer of the Railways
 railway agar apane faisle par kaayam he to uski apni samaj hogi, magar jo pareshaani ham tak pahunch rahi he usase hamen yahi lagata he ki garib chaatro ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa he

 bataaiye ki iskaa baccha 4000 kharch kar bangaloru ja saktaa he
 Think of one thing, how much stress he will have at this time
 do din kii yatra he use tikat nahin mila he
 This is a picture of some houses, from which you can guess which houses the students come from which are going to take the railway examination
 kisi ko tikat nahin mil rahaa he to kisi ko reserveshan nahin mil rahaa he
 At least the spectators and mps of the metropolis should understand why the money is being put on the students of poor houses to give their examinations
 main to ganit main kamazor hum magar shivank ne hisaab lagaaya ki 4 lakh bhi imtahaan dene nahin ja sake to 100 rupye farm bharne ke hisaab 16 karod kii kamai ho sakati he
 Eight lakh students have been troubled
 ye sankhya railway ke hisaab se he
 Many students whose forms have been rejected for strange reasons, they cry by calling that their four years have been wasted
 railway ne aaj jo press relij jari kii he usamen kahin bhi nahin likhaa he ki pariksha centre badalane ke vikalp die jaaenge
 So students should not pay attention to the information here and there
 abhi tak yahi soochna he ki railway ne unka centre badalane kaa koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Sudeep Samant has tweeted to the Railway Minister that he is from Bangalore but his center has been given to Kolkata
 yah kaise ho gaya he
 In this second tweet, Avinash has told the Railway Minister that he lives in Bangalore but the center of the examination has been given to Bhopal
 kripaya centre badalane kii suvidha dijie
 Krishna Kumar of Chandigarh has tweeted to the Railway Minister that his center has been given 1600 km away to Kolkata
 saurabh singh ne twit kiya he ki bhubaneshwar ke chaatr kaa centre gujarat padaa he, acha hota neuyark bhej dete
 Amritsar has given the center of Kumar Ashok of Rajasthan Sikar
 naveen ne twit kiya he ki dilli ke rahane vaale hai magar urisa centre padaa he
 What does online mean isliye is samasya ko bihar kendrit bataanaa thik nahin lagata he
 What does it mean to give Bhopal to a Bangalore student? chandigarh vaale ko kolkata dene kaa kya matlab he
 If Shivank had not helped so much, there would not have been many questions about the answer of the Railways
 railway agar apane faisle par kaayam he to uski apni samaj hogi, magar jo pareshaani ham tak pahunch rahi he usase hamen yahi lagata he ki garib chaatro ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa he
 After four-four years, the opportunity has come to give examination and that too, he has to leave the house for a week before giving the examination, then he should take notice of his problems
 kam se kam rail mantri ko apana twitor handle check kar lenaa chahie
 Not only this, the railway examiners are asking when they will get Rs 400 back for those who had filled the Rs 500 form
 aapako yaad hoga ki pehle farm kii keemat 500 rakhi gai thi lekin jab hamane prime time main sawaal uthaaya ki iees ke imtahaan vaale upieses kii farm 100 rupee kaa he or group di ke imtahaan kaa farm 500 kaa to yah ninsaphi he
 The Railways immediately reduced the rupees to 100 rupees and said that the remaining 400 rupees would be refunded
 aaj tak waapas nahin hue
 We told the financial situation of those students so that both the officers and spectators sitting in Rail Bhavan can see who takes the railway examination
 ve kahaan rahete hai, unke pariwaron kii aarthik banaavat kisi he
 Radha Kund railway station is near Mathura
 ek maheenaa pehle yah stesan chaalu hua tha
 This station was built at a cost of 15 crores but could not last even 30 days
 barish kaa bahaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he magar is hisaab se to is desh main kya kya nahin dhans janaa chahie barish ke dinon main
 Should the station sink within a month, is it normal? chota sa stesan he magar iskaa farsh dhans gaya he
 The entire floor of the bench where the bench is kept is sunken
 seedhiyaan dhans gai hai
 The walls have cracked
 platform dhans jaae aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 How much material the contractor must have made
 barish se dhansa he to kya use nahin pataa tha ki bharat main barish hoti he
 See photos of the walls inside the station
 sillen he or daraaren aa gai hai
 Our colleague Mukul Gautam went to Radhakund station
 sthaneey media main aane ke baad flatform par dhansi hui farsh ko ukhaad kar phir se kaam hone laga tha
 What Mukesh showed were pictures of work after the sunset
 tippaniyan 1400 students of Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia have been performing since 23 July
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki inke saath dhokhaa hua he
 At the time of admission, on the website, the prospectus wrote that this course is full time
 2014-15, 2015-17 or 2016-17 kaa teen saal isi mugaalate main guzar gaya ki hamane to bachaler of ejineering main daakhila liya he or degree milegi
 But in the last year it is said that their course is part time from AICTE
 chaatro kii baat sahi he ki phir inhen uniwarsity kii taraf se galat soochna kyon di gai ki course phul time he
 a part time Bachelor of Engineering degree is not considered a degree and is not recognized anywhere
 ek tarah se in chaatro kaa bhavishya barbaad hone ke kagaar par pahunch gaya he
 Due to their performance, the entrance examination for new admission has been canceled, but these students are looking for a way to save their lives
 7 dinon se lagaataar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Police has also been called on campus
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki jab tak inaki maang puri nahin hogi, phul time degree nahin milegi, tab tak ek ek chaatr bhukh hadtaal karne lagenge
 The students say they did not know that there is part time
 jab ek senior kii niyukti BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD main hui tab unhen naukari nahin di gai kyonki kaha gaya ki aapkaa course AICTE se part time manzur he
 The students started asking questions to the university
 jab jawaab nahin mila to andolan par utar aae
 The lives of 1400 students are at stake
 yahaan par paanch branch he jiske liye jamiya alag se pravesh pariksha leti he
 This course has been going on for many years, but now problems have started especially since 2005 when the court had canceled the recognition of part time course
 jo chaatr puraane hai or naukari kar rahe hai unhen bhi naukari main isaki degree ke kaaran dikkat aa rahi he
 If you are not sure, look at this blue shirt
 ye atm guard kii kameez he jise maheene kaa 3500 miltaa he
 Explain that his child can spend 4000 to go to Bangalore
 ek baat sochie to sahi ki wo is vakt kitna tanaav main hoga
 It is a two-day trip, he has not received a ticket
 ye kuch gharon kii tasviir he jisase aap andaaza kar sakate hai ki chaatr kin gharon se aate hai jo railway kii pariksha dene ja rahe hai
 If one is not getting a ticket, one is not getting a reservation
 kam se kam mahanagaron ke darshak or saansad mukhyamantri andaaza karen ki garib ghar ke chaatro par imtahaan dene ke liye paise kaa bhaar kyon daalaa ja rahaa he
 i am weak in Mathematics, but Shivank calculated that if 4 lakhs could not go for examination, then Rs 100 crore could be earned by filling the form of 100 rupees
 aath lakh chaatr pareshaan ho gaye hai
 This number is according to the railways
 bahut se chaatr jinke farm ajeeb ajeeb kaarnon se riject ho gaye hai wo phone karke rone lagate hai ki unke chaar saal barbaad ho gaye
 Nowhere in the press release that Railways has released today, it is written that options will be given to change the examination center
 isliye chaatr idhar udhar kii jaankariyon par dhyaan na den
 So far, it is reported that the Railways have not decided to change their center
 sudeep samant ne rail mantri ko twit kiya he ki ve bangaloru ke rahane vaale hai magar unka centre kolkata diya gaya he
 How has this happened? is duusare twit main avinaash ne railmantri ko kaha he ki ve bangaleru main rahete hai magar pariksha kaa centre bhopal de diya gaya he
 Please allow change of center
 chandigarh ke krishna kumaar ne rail mantri ko twit kiya he ki unka centre 1600 kimi dur kolkata de diya he
 Saurabh Singh tweeted that Bhubaneswar's student center was lying in Gujarat, it would have been nice to have been sent to New York
 rajasthan sikar ke kumaar ashok kaa centre amritsar de diya he
 Naveen has tweeted that he is a resident of Delhi but the Orissa Center is lying
 online kaa kya matlab hua
 Therefore, it does not seem right to call this problem Bihar-centric
 bangaleru ke chaatr ko bhopal dene kaa kya matlab he
 What does it mean to give Chandigarh to Kolkata? shivank ne itani madad na kii hoti to railway ke jawaab ko lekar itane sawaal nahin uthte
 If the railway is firm on its decision then it will have its own understanding, but due to the problem that is reaching us, we feel that the poor students are having fun
 chaar-chaar saal baad imtahaan dene kaa mauka aayaa he or wo bhi imtahaan dene ke liye haftaa bhar pehle ghar se nikalnaa pade ta phir unki pareshaani ko notice main lenaa chahie
 At least the railway minister should check his Twitter handle
 yahi nahin railway ke parikshaarthi puch rahe hai ki jinhone 500 rupee farm ke bhare the unka 400 rupaya kab waapas milegaa
 You may remember that the price of the first form was 500, but when we questioned in prime time that the form of UPSS with IAS examination is Rs 100 and for Group d examination, the form of 500 is unfair
 railway ne turant 100 rupaya kar diya or kaha ki baaki 400 rupee waapas honge
 Did not return till today

 The students are right that why they were given wrong information from the university that the course is full time

 In a way, the future of these students has reached the verge of ruin

 Students say that until their demand is not met, full time degree will not be given, then each student will start a hunger strike
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen pataa nahin tha ki part time he
 When a senior was appointed in BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD, he was not given a job because it was said that your course is part time approved by AICTE

 jab ek senior kii niyukti BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD main hui tab unhen naukari nahin di gai kyonki kaha gaya ki aapkaa course AICTE se part time manzur he
 The students started asking questions to the university
 jab jawaab nahin mila to andolan par utar aae
 The lives of 1400 students are at stake
 yahaan par paanch branch he jiske liye jamiya alag se pravesh pariksha leti he
 This course has been going on for many years, but now problems have started especially since 2005 when the court had canceled the recognition of part time course
 jo chaatr puraane hai or naukari kar rahe hai unhen bhi naukari main isaki degree ke kaaran dikkat aa rahi he
 Sudeep Samant has tweeted to the Railway Minister that he is from Bangalore but his center has been given to Kolkata
 yah kaise ho gaya he
 In this second tweet, Avinash has told the Railway Minister that he lives in Bangalore but the center of the examination has been given to Bhopal
 kripaya centre badalane kii suvidha dijie
 Krishna Kumar of Chandigarh has tweeted to the Railway Minister that his center has been given 1600 km away to Kolkata
 saurabh singh ne twit kiya he ki bhubaneshwar ke chaatr kaa centre gujarat padaa he, acha hota neuyark bhej dete
 Amritsar has given the center of Kumar Ashok of Rajasthan Sikar
 naveen ne twit kiya he ki dilli ke rahane vaale hai magar urisa centre padaa he
 What does online mean isliye is samasya ko bihar kendrit bataanaa thik nahin lagata he
 What does it mean to give Bhopal to a Bangalore student? chandigarh vaale ko kolkata dene kaa kya matlab he
 If Shivank had not helped so much, there would not have been many questions about the answer of the Railways
 railway agar apane faisle par kaayam he to uski apni samaj hogi, magar jo pareshaani ham tak pahunch rahi he usase hamen yahi lagata he ki garib chaatro ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa he
 After four-four years, the opportunity has come to give examination and that too, he has to leave the house for a week before giving the examination, then he should take notice of his problems
 kam se kam rail mantri ko apana twitor handle check kar lenaa chahie
 Not only this, the railway examiners are asking when they will get Rs 400 back for those who had filled the Rs 500 form
 aapako yaad hoga ki pehle farm kii keemat 500 rakhi gai thi lekin jab hamane prime time main sawaal uthaaya ki iees ke imtahaan vaale upieses kii farm 100 rupee kaa he or group di ke imtahaan kaa farm 500 kaa to yah ninsaphi he
 The Railways immediately reduced the rupees to 100 rupees and said that the remaining 400 rupees would be refunded
 aaj tak waapas nahin hue
 We told the financial situation of those students so that both the officers and spectators sitting in Rail Bhavan can see who takes the railway examination
 ve kahaan rahete hai, unke pariwaron kii aarthik banaavat kisi he
 Radha Kund railway station is near Mathura
 ek maheenaa pehle yah stesan chaalu hua tha
 This station was built at a cost of 15 crores but could not last even 30 days
 barish kaa bahaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he magar is hisaab se to is desh main kya kya nahin dhans janaa chahie barish ke dinon main
 Should the station sink within a month, is it normal? chota sa stesan he magar iskaa farsh dhans gaya he
 The entire floor of the bench where the bench is kept is sunken
 seedhiyaan dhans gai hai
 The walls have cracked
 platform dhans jaae aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 How much material the contractor must have made
 barish se dhansa he to kya use nahin pataa tha ki bharat main barish hoti he
 See photos of the walls inside the station
 sillen he or daraaren aa gai hai
 Our colleague Mukul Gautam went to Radhakund station
 sthaneey media main aane ke baad flatform par dhansi hui farsh ko ukhaad kar phir se kaam hone laga tha
 What Mukesh showed were pictures of work after the sunset
 tippaniyan 1400 students of Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia have been performing since 23 July
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki inke saath dhokhaa hua he
 At the time of admission, on the website, the prospectus wrote that this course is full time
 2014-15, 2015-17 or 2016-17 kaa teen saal isi mugaalate main guzar gaya ki hamane to bachaler of ejineering main daakhila liya he or degree milegi
 But in the last year it is said that their course is part time from AICTE
 chaatro kii baat sahi he ki phir inhen uniwarsity kii taraf se galat soochna kyon di gai ki course phul time he
 a part time Bachelor of Engineering degree is not considered a degree and is not recognized anywhere
 ek tarah se in chaatro kaa bhavishya barbaad hone ke kagaar par pahunch gaya he
 Due to their performance, the entrance examination for new admission has been canceled, but these students are looking for a way to save their lives
 7 dinon se lagaataar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Police has also been called on campus
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki jab tak inaki maang puri nahin hogi, phul time degree nahin milegi, tab tak ek ek chaatr bhukh hadtaal karne lagenge
 The students say they did not know that there is part time
 jab ek senior kii niyukti BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD main hui tab unhen naukari nahin di gai kyonki kaha gaya ki aapkaa course AICTE se part time manzur he
 The students started asking questions to the university
 jab jawaab nahin mila to andolan par utar aae
 The lives of 1400 students are at stake
 yahaan par paanch branch he jiske liye jamiya alag se pravesh pariksha leti he
 This course has been going on for many years, but now problems have started especially since 2005 when the court had canceled the recognition of part time course
 jo chaatr puraane hai or naukari kar rahe hai unhen bhi naukari main isaki degree ke kaaran dikkat aa rahi he
 Therefore, it does not seem right to call this problem Bihar-centric
 bangaleru ke chaatr ko bhopal dene kaa kya matlab he
 What does it mean to give Chandigarh to Kolkata? shivank ne itani madad na kii hoti to railway ke jawaab ko lekar itane sawaal nahin uthte
 If the railway is firm on its decision then it will have its own understanding, but due to the problem that is reaching us, we feel that the poor students are having fun
 chaar-chaar saal baad imtahaan dene kaa mauka aayaa he or wo bhi imtahaan dene ke liye haftaa bhar pehle ghar se nikalnaa pade ta phir unki pareshaani ko notice main lenaa chahie
 At least the railway minister should check his Twitter handle
 yahi nahin railway ke parikshaarthi puch rahe hai ki jinhone 500 rupee farm ke bhare the unka 400 rupaya kab waapas milegaa
 You may remember that the price of the first form was 500, but when we questioned in prime time that the form of UPSS with IAS examination is Rs 100 and for Group d examination, the form of 500 is unfair
 railway ne turant 100 rupaya kar diya or kaha ki baaki 400 rupee waapas honge
 Did not return till today
 hamane un chaatro kii aarthik sthiti bataai taaki rail bhawan main baithe adhikari or darshak donon dekh len ki railway kii pariksha koun log dete hai
 How is the economic structure of their families where they live

 The students are right that why they were given wrong information from the university that the course is full time
 part time bachaler of ejineering kii degree degree nahin maani jaati or isaki kahin manyata nahin he
 In a way, the future of these students has reached the verge of ruin

 Performing continuously for 7 days
 campus main police bhi bula lee gai he
 Students say that until their demand is not met, full time degree will not be given, then each student will start a hunger strike
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen pataa nahin tha ki part time he
 When a senior was appointed in BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD, he was not given a job because it was said that your course is part time approved by AICTE
 chaatro ne uniwarsity se sawaal poochna shuru kar diya
 When the answer was not received, they came out on the movement

 desh kii rajdhani dilli ke logon kaa halak suukh rahaa he
 The government is making all the claims of development and amenities, but a reality is that lakhs of people here still do not get even 1 liter of water every day
 hindustan kii dhadkan he dilli, sapanom kaa shahar he dilli, yahaan koltar kii chaudee-chaudee sadaken hai, yahaan atyaadhunik metro seva he, yahaan sabake liye sabakuch milane vaale aaleeshaan bazaar hai; lekin agar kuch nahin he to wo sabake liye svachh pani
 The power of the country runs from here
 desh ke liye kanoon yaheen se banataa he, desh ke vikaas ke liye nitiyaan bhi yaheen tay hoti hai, lekin afsos iske baavjood dilli kii janata pyaasi he
 The population of Delhi has been around twenty million, but still many lakh people do not get the basic facilities of life
 dilli ke kai ilaakon main jameen ke neeche pani kaa str 150 feet neeche tak ja pahunchaa he
 148 from water ground in Chhatarpur area of south Delhi
 5 feet neeche ja chukaa he
 Water is getting 132 feet below ground in Vasant Kunj in south west Delhi
 dakshin dilli ke hi chitaranjan park main jaldevataa ab jameen se 116 feet neeche paae jane lage hai
 In different parts of Delhi, the water level has fallen from 30 percent to 200 percent
 pani ko lekar dilli kii sachai or bhi khatarnaak he
 There are 629 official sources of water in Delhi
 inamen se 2008 se lekar 2012 tak 304 strot puri tarah se suukh chuke hai yaa gaayab ho chuke hai
 Not only this, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee examined 223 samples of water, out of which only 46 percent were found to be drinkable
 aaj bhi dilli ke kai shahari ilaakon main nalon se kaala ganda jaharila pani nikalataa he
 It is a compulsion; it also has to be drunk; it also requires a bath
 dilli main har roj 1025 million galen pani kii zarurat hoti lekin pani miltaa he sirf 835 million galen yani maang or supplai main har roj kami he 190 million galen pani kii
 Statistics testify that the situation is getting out of control
 agar vakt rahete dilli main pani ke sangrakshan or pani kii barbaadi rokane ke upaay nahin kiye gaye to rajdhani main pani kii ek ek boond ke liye khun kharaba hote der nahin lagegi
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met the media before the GST Council meeting in Goa

 a friend shot dead another friend in Sangam Vihar area of south East Delhi
 philhal police ghatana ke vakt maujuud tisare shaks se poochtacha kar pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki aakhir kis baat ko lekar dost ne hi dost kaa qatl kar diya
 Sanjay was shot by his friend Praveen

 Family members say that if there was any quarrel or conflict with Praveen, why would Sanjay go with him? At present, the police are constantly questioning the third person present at the time of this incident, what happened between the two at the time of the incident
 sanjay ke bhattije karan ne bataaya ki koi dushmani nahin thi
 Had called on food, if something like this had happened, why would he go? اتكلم عن جمال صوت دلجيت وجمال بيبو ولا جمالهم سوا ولا بيبو وبنطالون كرن لطافه لطافه لابعد حد **طبعاً مرن كلجه وم فيني اعدلها

 But the war of Sudarshan Chakra has not yet calmed down, this has resulted in complete Kashi ashes along with Kashi Naresh's son
