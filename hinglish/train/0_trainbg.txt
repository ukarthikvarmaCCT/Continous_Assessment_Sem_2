 Troubled by the harassment of ngos, MNREGA workers now want the government to remove the ngos and appoint them directly on contractual basis
 deepawali ke din jab puure pradesh ke log tyohaar manaa rahe the, us samay bhi maranegakarmi vidhansabha ke saamne apni maangon ko lekar date hue the
 a total of 2,641 posts of MNREGA workers have been created in Uttarakhand, but 50 percent of these posts have not been appointed
 abhi yah pariyojna keval 1,124 karmchaariyon ke sahare hi chal rahi he, jisamen 800 rojgaar sevak, 230 junior ejeeniyar va 94 computer oparator hai
 The government's seriousness towards this scheme can be gauged from the fact that not a single employment servant has been appointed in Dehradun
 manaregakarmiyon kaa aarope he ki enjio unke vetan se lekar bhavishyanidhi ke paise main na sirf golmaal karte hai, balki maheenon tak unka vetan bhi roak diya jaataa he
 Regarding the appointment of employees in the draft of MGNREGA project, it has been written that the state government can appoint employees through contract or service provider
 manaregaa karmiyon kaa sawaal yah he ki jab adhinium ke mutabik rajya sarkaar khud niyukti kar sakati thi to usne seva pradaata ke rup main enjio ko bich main rakhane kaa vikalp kyon chunaa
 The workers allege that ngos as service providers only keep track of the attendance of MNREGA workers and forward it to the CDO and the District Magistrate from where the salary of MGNREGA workers is paid to the NGO on the basis of this attendance
 is kaary ke liye sarkaar enjio ko karmchaariyon ke vetan kaa paanch se aath pratishat kamishan detii he
 Despite this, the situation is that all the six ngos working with MNREGA in the state are leaving no stone unturned to exploit the employees
 uttarakhand manaregaa karmchaaree sanghathan ke koshadhyaksh sundaramni semwal kaa kahana he ki enjio kai-kai maheenon tak vetan rokkar apane khaaton main byaaj banaate hai
 The institutions were supposed to deposit 12 percent of the salary in their provident fund accounts, but the investigation revealed that hundreds of provident fund accounts in almost all districts including Pauri, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Almora, Pithoragarh
 jin khaaton main rakam jamaa bhi kii gai, vah bhi vetan ke 12 fisadi ke hisaab se behad kam he
 After the agitation that started on 5 September, the government assured to deploy on contract basis, but even after two months, no steps have been taken in this direction
 karmiyon ne 11 sitambar se bhukh hadtaal shuru kii
 After a week-long hunger strike, former Chief Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Bhagat Singh Koshiyari announced the appointment of all MNREGA workers on a government contract after reaching the site of the agitation, but it also proved to be a sham
 24 sitambar ko rajya kii graamy vikaas mantri vijaya badthwaal ne vahaan pahunchakar is baat kaa likhit aashwaasan diya ki is maamle main turant karrwai kii jaaegi, lekin us aashwaasan ko bhi ek maheene se upar ho gaya he
 State General Secretary of Uttarakhand MNREGA Employees Organization, Rajendra Prasad Nautiyal, says that despite the written orders of Barthwal, officials are ignoring the case
 sarkari yojana main paanch saal kaam karne ke baad bhi unka bhavishya asurakshit he
 The movement of MNREGA workers is also impacting the implementation of the project

 More than 5,000 job cards have not been generated in the state even after application

 anandapal kii maa or uski beti is encounter kii sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 They demand that the two brothers of Anandpal be brought for cremation and let the elder daughter Yogita come from Dubai
 anandapal kii badi beti yogita ke khilaaf rajasthan police ne lukout notice jari kar rakhaa he
 Because the police suspect that Yogita also helped her father escape from prison
 lekin gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki anandapal ek samajasevi tha
 None of his crimes have been proved in court so far
 wo jail se tab bhaaga tha, jab us par baar jail main lagaataar jaanaleva hamale ho rahe the
 Anandpal's wife and mother say that they will not give cremation until demands are met
 choti beti charanjit kaa kahana he ki uske pita kafarji encounterkia gaya he
 Why is the police not investigating him? anandapal kii maut ke baad puure rajasthan main rajput samaaj andolan par utraa hua he
 It is alleged that Anandpal was sent by the leaders to the world of crime and he was killed because if he was caught alive, the secrets of many leaders would be revealed
 anandapal kii do betiyon ke alaava ek betaa bhi he
 But the son is mentally weak
 badi beti dubai main rahati he
 Some say she handles Anandpal's business in Dubai, while some say she studies in Dubai
 badi beti yogita par apane pita ko jail se bhagane kaa aarope he
 The younger daughter is studying management in Pune
 pichley 21 maheenon se tamaam suraksha agenciyon kii ankhon main dhul jhunkane vaale anandapal kii maut ke saath hi rajasthan main aparaadh kii duniya kaa ek adhyay khatm ho gaya
 Gangstar Anandpal remained the biggest challenge for the Rajasthan Police Force since Ferrari
 anandapal wo sawaal ban chukaa tha, jiskaa jawaab grih mantri or dijipi se har ek pres conference main maanga jaataa tha
 On the night of 24th June, there was a news at around ten past ten
 rajasthan ke churu jile ke ratangarh ilaake main gaanv malasar main haive ke kinare do manjila makaan bana tha
 The house was surrounded by armed men from the police and SOG team
 makaan kii upree chat par maujuud tha mostwanted anandapal singh, jise police or esaoji kii team ne muthbhed main maar giraaya
 Many questions have also been raised about the encounter - 1
 masalan police kaa kahana he ki anandapal kii jaankaree uske bhaiyon se mili jabaki anandapal ke kahin hone kii jaankaree bhaiyon ko bhi nahin rahati thi
 2
 anandapal ke paas do eke-47 thi or 400 kaartoos bache the or wo eke-47 se goliyaan barasaa rahaa tha phir bhi police ne uske paas jaakar peeth main goli maar di
 3
 ghayal pulicekarmi rajput hi kyon dikhaae gaye hai
 Because the sympathy of the Rajputs was with Anandpal
 eke-47 se keval maamuli ghayal kare, aisa bhi anaadi nahin tha anandapal
 4
 soharabuddin farji encounter main chargeshited rahe grahamantri gulabchand kataaria baar-baar kyon kah rahe hai ki mujhe nahin pataa tha
 The Chief Minister told me
 saath hi soharabuddin maamle main hi jamaanat par chal rahe aiji dinesh enem puure maamle ko lead kar rahe the lekin kaha ki mujhe is baat kaa pataa nahin tha ki muthbhed anandapal se chal rahi thi
 5
 police kaa ye bhi kahana ki seedhi par jaakar aainaa laga diya or aaine main dekhakar goli maari gai, yah baat gale nahin utarati he
 One went to install the mirror at ten thirty in the night and the second one came in the house where Anandpal was firing the mirror
 6
 When Anandpal was shooting from the house, how were the policemen entering the house and locking the women in a room
 7
 DGP Manoj Bhatt had refused to speak on this issue on Saturday night, saying that everyone would speak together in the morning
 anandapal farrotedaar angreji bolne vaala padhaa likhaa lau graduate tha
 But Anandpal came into the world of crime after losing by two votes to former minister Harjiran Buraq's son in the election
 sharaab ke dhandhe se lekar apharan or hatya tak main uskaa dakhal tha
 Then she joined Sikar's lady dan Anuradha Chaudhary
 anandapal par hatya, lut, phiroti, apharan ke 24 maamle rajasthan ke alag-alag thanon main darj hai
 Anandpal had hideouts in 5 states of the country
 uske 108 gurgon ko police ab tak pakad chuki he
 Of these, 60 have been granted bail while 48 are still in jail
 police ke anusaar mantri, vidhayak or afasar samet 21 logon ko anandapal se khatra tha
 Let us tell you that on 3 September 2015, while returning from the court in Didwana Court, Anandpal escaped with his two companions
 is ghatana ne rajasthan kii siyasat main bhuuchaal laa diya tha
 His absconding became a question of the Rajasthan Police's nose
 police ne use pakadaney kii koshish to kii lekin kamyaabi nahin mili
 The task of capturing it was then given to SOG and ATS
 esaoji or aties ne bhi prayaas kiye lekin safalataa nahin mili
 Taking command of the SOG, Dinesh MN, after taking action one by one, in collaboration with the district police, caught 100 gangs of Anandpal Gang and seized assets worth about 200 crores
 jisase anandapal kii aarthik qamar tut gai thi

 Ganguly said, "good marketing of Test cricket is necessary
 mujhe bhi lagata he ki yah samay kii maang he
 People do not have time to watch Test cricket in the morning, it is a matter of 'common sense'
 ' saurav ganguli ne kaha ki unhen eden gardens par bangladesh ke khilaaf har roj darshakon se bhare stand kii ummid nahin thi
 Ganguly said that there will be more enthusiasm for Test matches against strong teams like Australia, England and New Zealand
 unhone yah bhi kaha, 'pink ball test paaramparik test maichon kii jagah nahin le sakate, jo subah 9

 Infosys co-founder and former CEO Krish Gopalakrishnan participated in it
 manch saajha karte hue unhone technology ke kai pahaluon par baat kii
 Also answered the questions of the students present in the program
 ek behtareen starop kaisaa hona chahie? is sawaal ke jawaab main krish gopalkrishnan ne kaha ki starop kaa idia kaaphi hatke or nayaa hona chahie
 There should be an idea that can change the world
 saath hi idia main itnaa nayaapan hona chahie ki log us idia par kaam karne ke liye dilchaspee len
 He also said that the idea of generating ideas is a 5 percent challenge
 asal mushkil uske kriyanvan main hoti he
 Raising the company is a marathon
 raaton-raat koi bhi company khadi nahin hoti
 Apart from this, about the threat of job, Krish says that every technology can take away your job
 hamemshinonke saath rahanaa he or unke jitna smart bananaa he
 Technology also creates new jobs
 jaise fasebuk par 23 hajaar log keval photose filter karne kaa kaam karte hai
 At a time when people are thinking that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other automatic technologies can take away our jobs, Krish believes something else
 unhone kaha ki AI aaj ke daur main bahut sari chizon ko badal saktaa he
 For example, he told that if a cart driver does not learn to drive in the age of machines, he will lose
 har nai technology main logon ko riples karne kii kshamta hoti he
 In such a situation, we have to identify the future jobs and develop our skills accordingly
 artificial intelligence par baat karte hue krish ne kaha ki AI keval ek calculating mashin he
 Humans will have to learn what to calculate
 AI kaa upyoghelthsector samet kai or sector main behatar tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 Because it works with machine learning and can remember more data than humans
 AI se paidaa hone vaali nai naukariyon par baat karte hue infosis ke purv siio ne kaha ki artificial intelligence sephaydautane kaa ye sahi samay he
 Developing algorithms for machine learning or creating new chips and processors for machines are the tasks that youngsters can go into
 yuvaaon se baat karte hue krish ne kaha ki aapke liye maujuuda trend ko pahchaanana jaruri he or isi par aage badhanaa he
 He said AI, machine learning, neuroscience and brain science are recent trends that can be taken forward

 We got a lot of love in Kolkata and everywhere and i would like to thank everyone for this
 mumbai ne keeran pollard (naabad 60) kii shandaar ballebaaji ke dam par pehle khelte hue superkings ke saamne 149 ranon kaa lakshya rakhaa, jo sateek gendbaaji karne vaale uske gendbaajon ke umdaa pradarshan ke kaaran super kings ke liye baari sabit hua or ek se ek shandaar khilaadiyon se ladi paanchavin baar final khel rahi team lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 20 overon main nau wicket ganvaakar 125 ran hi bana saki
 The Mumbai Indians team won the Super Kings by 23 runs in the title match played at the Eden Gardens Stadium on Sunday and captured the title for the first time
 rohit ne match ke baad kaha, ham jaanate the ki beete paanch saal hamaare liye sookhe rahe hai or isi kaaran ham is saal khitaab kaa sookhaa khatm karne ko lekar kritasankalp the

 We had strategized that our strike bowlers would bowl to their best batsmen
 kolkata or har jagah hamen bahut pyaar mila or main iske liye sabakaa dhanyavad karnaa chaahunga
 Mumbai, aiming for 149 runs in front of the Superkings on the basis of the superb batting of Kieran Pollard (60 not out), proved to be huge for the Super Kings due to the excellent performance of their bowlers who bowled accurately and one to one
 The team, playing the final for the fifth time laden with players, could only manage 125 runs after losing nine wickets in 20 overs

 There are two pictures on your screen
 ek kisaan kii he or doosraa udyogpati vijay maalya kii he
 One takes loans from banks for farming and one for business
 ek pachaas-saath hazaar rupee ke karz ko bardaasht nahin kar paata, or ek hazaron karod rupee ke karz uthaa letaa he
 Loans are necessary for both farming and business
 magar jab kheti chaupat hoti he to kisaan faansee ke fande par pahunch jaataa he
 If the businessman's business gets drowned, then his health does not matter because he takes a loan not in his name, but in the name of the company
 2014 main 5642 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 According to a report in Hindu newspaper, from 2001 to 2015 in Maharashtra, 20,504 farmers have committed suicide
 26 farvari 2016 ke indian express kii report main likhaa he ki maharashtra ke marathavada main 2015 main 1100 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii or is saal janvari-farvari main 139 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Lack of debt is a major cause of suicide
 2013 se 2015 ke bich bharat ke sarkari bainkon ne badi-badi companiyon kaa 1
 14 lakh crores waived off debt
 desh ke qareeb aadhe kisaan karz main duube hai
 Of these, 42 per cent are owed to banks and 26 per cent are owed to Mahajans
 31 march, 2015 tak desh ke top paanch bainkon kaa 4
 87 lakh crore rupees was outstanding on only 44 big companies
 ye sabhi bakaaedaar wo hai jin par paanch hazaar karod se zyaada kaa bakaayaa he
 The State Bank of India has announced that the loan of 21,313 crore can no longer be repaid
 yadi aap kisaan hai to yaad kiijie ki kis bank ne aapkaa lone kab maaf kiya he
 Right off that you have suffered so much due to crop and market hit that you cannot repay the loan, so the bank declares a loan loan of so many thousand crores
 kisaanon ko upkaar film kaa gaanaa sunaaya jaataa he or companiyon par lakhon karodon ke upkaar kiye jate hai
 There is a difference between a farmer and a company
 donon desh ke liye bainkon se karz lete hai magar karz na chukaa paane kii sthiti main donon ke alag kanoon he
 Banks declare bankable defaulters to be unable to repay loans
 ek prakriya hoti he vasuuli kii, jitani ho sakati he hoti he na hui to use maaf kar diya jaataa he
 The rough case is that Vijay Mallya formed a company, Kingfisher Airlines
 yah company ab band ho chuki he or is par 17 karzdaataaon ke 7800 karod rupye bakaayaa hai
 State Bank of India has 1600 crore rupees left on Kingfisher
 baaki karzdaataaon main punjab neshnal bank, bank of baroda, kaknara bank, bank of india, central bank of india, fedral bank, euko bank or dena bank shaamil hai
 Kingfisher Airlines stopped repaying the loan from January 2012 after incurring losses
 pichley saal state bank of india ne maalya ko vilphul difolter yani jaanboojhkar karz naa chukaane vaala ghoshit kar diya
 Punjab National Bank also declared Vijay Mallya as his company United Breweries Holdings and Kingfisher Airlines as a defaulter
 is bich vijay maalya ne sharaab company united spirits limited ko landan main listed company diajio ko apni hissedari bechney kaa qaraar kiya
 Under this, Diageo has to pay Rs 515 crore to Vijay Mallya
 iske baad is company kii sari dendaree se maalya mukt ho jaaenge
 Mallya saheb has called this deal a sweethard deal after which he wants to spend time with his family in London
 is bich state bank of india vijay maalya ke kilaaf date recovery tribunel chalaa gaya
 SBI said that Vijay Mallya, promoter of UP group from Diageo company, is getting Rs 515 crore, which should be the first right of the borrowers
 bank ne DRT se kaha he ki maalya ke kilaaf karrwai kii jaae
 On a priority basis, the DRT judge first took up the petition in which the first claimant on the amount received from Diageo was the debtors
 vijay maalya ke vakil hola ne kaha ki unke muvakkil reliance jaisi badi companiyon ke muqaabale bahut chote difolter hai
 They allege that banks are harassing small defaulters while leaving large defaulters
 unhone reserve bank kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki bank badi machhliyon ke kilaaf karrwai nahin karte hai
 Many companies have defaulted to forty thousand crores and nothing happens to them
 7800 karod kaa karjadaar apane ko chota difolter bataata he
 Points to a defaulter of four hundred million
 ek aap hai jo pachaas saath hazaar ke karz kaa boj nahin uthaa pate hai
 That's why you watch 'upkar'
 tivi mat dekhie
 Banks have shown activism about Vijay Mallya, but are they doing the same with the big creditors
 agar ye sari vasuuli ho jaae to kaala dhan se pehle lone dhan se hi sabake khate lahalha uthenge
 Vijay Mallya has also written a letter to present his side
 maalya ne likhaa he ki media main unke kilaaf abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 He launched Kingfisher Airlines company after an evaluation of international advisors and SBI Capital Market
 durbhagyapurna he ki company bazaar or sarkaar kii nitiyon ke kaaran nahin chal saki
 On 31 January 2012, the State Bank of India wrote to the Reserve Bank of India
 aisa nahin he ki kingfisher ne lone nahin chukaaye hai
 1250 crores is deposited in different cases in Karnataka High Court
 sheyaron ko bechakar 1244 karod nakad raashi ricover kii gai he
 2494 crore has been recovered in total
 main bainkon se lagaataar sampark main hum or ek hi baar main lone dein rafa dfa karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 i have not personally taken any loan
 na hi main difolter hum
 i am helping in every legal process
 mujhe baikon ke enpie kaa poster bvoy banaaya ja rahaa he jabaki bainkon kaa enpie 11 lakh karod he
 There are many creditors who have taken more money than Kingfisher
 inamen se kisi difolter ko vilphul difolter nahin banaaya gaya he
 i have challenged this in court
 hamaara bhi to paisa duba he
 We had invested 4000 crores in Kingfisher Airlines
 bainkon ko to kuch na kuch hissaa mil bhi gaya he
 Are the banks just targeting Vijay Mallya? unhen hi vilphul difolter ghoshit kar rahe hai
 According to the Mail Today newspaper of 26 February, the Central Bank of India has issued a public notice against Unitech, a real estate company, that they owe Rs 38 crore 53 lakh
 unitech kaa jawaab chapa tha ki hamane 300 main se 264 karod chukaa diye hai
 The remaining amount will be paid soon
 isliye sahi nahin he ki sirf maalya sahab ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The question is definitely who are the people on whom the banks have millions of crores left and action is not taken against them on a war footing
 indian express ne artiai ke zariye pataa kiya he ki sarkari bainkon ne pichley teen saal main 1 lakh 14 hazaar karod rupee maaf kiye hai
 Which is called Right of in English
 bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish justise tii
 s
 thakur kii bench ne kaha he ki logon par sarkari bainkon ke hazaron karod rupee ke karz hai
 This is the biggest fraud
 2015 main das bade bainkon ne 40,000 karod ke karz maaf kar diye
 The court has also sought a list of creditors who have taken loans of more than 500 crores
 kya kisi kisaan ne aisi koi khabar padhi he ki uskaa lone maaf ho gaya
 So he should listen to the song of Upkar and thank Manoj Kumar saheb
 do bigha zamin na denkhen bevajaah tanaav ho jayega
 The comments pichley saal disambar jab maalya sahab saath saal ke hue to goa main ek party di
 Called just 600 people and stayed in a five-star hotel and the party would have happened
 ise lekar kaaphi hangaamaa hua ki aapaki company par hazaron karod ke karz he or aap hai ki shahi tareeke se janmdin manaa rahe hai
 Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan Saheb also said that you have a system loan
 aisa lagata he ki aap logon ko massej de rahe hai ki aapako in sab baton se koi fark nahin padataa
 If you are in trouble then you should reduce your expenses
 maalya sahab ke paas ipel kii ek team he or unhone saadhe teraa karod dekar carabinayan cricket lig main team kharidi he
 Kingfisher employees have not received arrears of salary
 unhone maalya ko khulaa patr likhaa he ki maalya ji aapke haath koon se range hai
 The Finance Minister says that banks have sufficient powers to recover dues and the government is not making any political interference in this jurisdiction
 kya bank us adhikaar kaa istamaal kar rahe hai
 Somewhere the government is not saving these big creditors in the name of saving banks

 According to the Mail Today newspaper of 26 February, the Central Bank of India has issued a public notice against Unitech, a real estate company, that they owe Rs 38 crore 53 lakh
 unitech kaa jawaab chapa tha ki hamane 300 main se 264 karod chukaa diye hai
 The remaining amount will be paid soon

 thakur kii bench ne kaha he ki logon par sarkari bainkon ke hazaron karod rupee ke karz hai
 This is the biggest fraud
 2015 main das bade bainkon ne 40,000 karod ke karz maaf kar diye
 The court has also sought a list of creditors who have taken loans of more than 500 crores

 2013 se 2015 ke bich bharat ke sarkari bainkon ne badi-badi companiyon kaa 1
 14 lakh crores waived off debt
 desh ke qareeb aadhe kisaan karz main duube hai
 Of these, 42 per cent are owed to banks and 26 per cent are owed to Mahajans
 31 march, 2015 tak desh ke top paanch bainkon kaa 4
 87 lakh crore rupees was outstanding on only 44 big companies
 ye sabhi bakaaedaar wo hai jin par paanch hazaar karod se zyaada kaa bakaayaa he
 The State Bank of India has announced that the loan of 21,313 crore can no longer be repaid
 yadi aap kisaan hai to yaad kiijie ki kis bank ne aapkaa lone kab maaf kiya he
 Right off that you have suffered so much due to crop and market hit that you cannot repay the loan, so the bank declares a loan loan of so many thousand crores
 kisaanon ko upkaar film kaa gaanaa sunaaya jaataa he or companiyon par lakhon karodon ke upkaar kiye jate hai
 There is a difference between a farmer and a company
 donon desh ke liye bainkon se karz lete hai magar karz na chukaa paane kii sthiti main donon ke alag kanoon he
 Banks declare bankable defaulters to be unable to repay loans

 The rough case is that Vijay Mallya formed a company, Kingfisher Airlines

 baaki karzdaataaon main punjab neshnal bank, bank of baroda, kaknara bank, bank of india, central bank of india, fedral bank, euko bank or dena bank shaamil hai

 motaa moti maamla yah he ki vijay maalya ne ek company banaai kingfisher airlines
 The company is now closed and owes Rs 7800 crore to 17 lenders
 state bank of india ke 1600 karod rupaya kingfisher par baaki hai
 The remaining borrowers include Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Kakanara Bank, Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Federal Bank, UCO Bank and Dena Bank
 kingfisher airlines ne ghate main jane ke baad janvari 2012 se karz chukaana janaa band kar diya tha
 Last year, State Bank of India declared Mallya a willful defaulter, intentionally defaulter
 punjab neshnal bank ne bhi vijay maalya unki company united bruaries holdings or kingfisher airlines ko vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya tha
 Meanwhile, Vijay Mallya agreed to sell his stake in liquor company United Spirits Ltd to listed company Diageo in London
 iske tahat diajio ne 515 karod rupye vijay maalya ko chukaane hai
 After this, Mallya will be freed from all the liability of this company
 maalya sahab ne is deal ko sweethard deal kaha he jiske baad ve landan main apane parivaar ke saath samay vyateet karnaa chaahate hai
 Meanwhile, the State Bank of India went against Debt Mallya's debt recovery tribunal
 SBI ne kaha ki diajio company se upi group ke pramotor vijay maalya ko 515 karod rupye mil rahe hai, us par karzdaaron kaa pehla haq hona chahie
 The bank has asked the DRT to take action against Mallya
 DRT ke jaj ne praathamikta ke aadhaar par sabase pehle us yachika ko liya jisamen diajio se mili rakam par pehla haq karzdaataaon kaa bataaya gaya he
 Hola, Vijay Mallya's lawyer, said that his clients are very small defaulters compared to big companies like Reliance
 unka aarope he ki bank chote difoltaron ko pareshaan kar rahe hai jabaki bade difoltaron ko chhod rahe hai
 He cited the Reserve Bank as saying that banks do not take action against big fish
 kai companiyon ne to chalis hazaar karod tak kaa difolt kiya he or unhen kuch nahin hota
 The debtor of 7800 crores describes himself as a small defaulter
 chalis hazaar karod vaale difolter kii taraf ishaara karata he
 You are the one who cannot bear the debt of fifty sixty thousand
 isliye aap 'upkaar' film dekhiye
 Don't watch tv bainkon ne vijay maalya ko lekar sakriyata to dikhaai he lekin kya ve bade lendaaron ke saath bhi vaisaa hi kar rahe hai
 If all this recovery is done, then everyone's accounts will be stirred by loan money before black money
 vijay maalya ne bhi ek patr likhakar apana paksh rakhaa he
 Mallya has written that a campaign is going against him in the media
 unhone kingfisher airlines company antarrashtriya salaahkaaron or esbiai capital market ke moolyankan ke baad launch kii thi
 It is unfortunate that the company could not run due to market and government policies
 31 janvari 2012 ko state bank of india ne bhartiya reserve bank ko yahi likhaa he
 It is not that Kingfisher has not repaid the loan
 1250 karod rupee alag-alag maamalon main karnataka hai court main jamaa hai
 1244 crore cash amount has been recovered by selling shares
 kul milakar 2494 karod kii recovery ho chuki he
 i am in constant touch with the banks and trying to clear the loan at one go
 maine vyaktigat rup se koi karz nahin liya he
 Nor am i a defaulter
 main har kanoonee prakriya main madad kar rahaa hum
 i am being made the poster boy of npas of banks while the npas of banks are 11 lakh crores
 kai lender aise hai jinhone kingfisher se zyada paise liye hai
 None of these defaulters have been made as willful defaulters
 maine adaalat main ise chunauti di he
 We too have lost money
 hamane kingfisher airlines main 4000 karod nivesh kiye the
 The banks have also got some share
 kya bank sirf vijay maalya ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 They are declared willful defaulters
 26 farvari ke mail today akhbaar ke anusaar central bank of india ne real estate kii company unitech ke khilaaf saarvajanik notice jari kiya he ki un par 38 karod 53 lakh rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 Unitech's reply was printed that we have paid 264 crores out of 300
 baaki kii rakam jaldi chukaa di jaaegi
 So it is not right that only Mallya saheb is being targeted
 yah sawaal zarur he ki wo koun log hai jin par bainkon ke lakhon karod baaki hai or unke kilaaf yuddh str par karrwai nahin hoti he
 The Indian Express has revealed through RTI that the public sector banks have waived 1 lakh 14 thousand crore rupees in the last three years
 jise angreji main rhite of kehete hai
 Chief Justice of India Justice T
 es
 The bench of Thakur has said that people owe thousands of crores of rupees on public sector banks
 yah sabase bada frod he
 In 2015, ten big banks waived debts of Rs 40,000 crore
 court ne aise lendaaron kii suchi bhi maangi he jinhone 500 karod se adhik ke karz liye hai
 Has any farmer read any such news that his loan has been forgiven
 isliye use upkaar film kaa gaanaa sunanaa chahie or unhen manoj kumaar sahab kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Do not see two bighas of land will cause unnecessary stress
 tippaniyan Last December, when Mallya sahib turned sixty, he gave a party in Goa
 sirf 600 logon ko bulaakar paanch sitara hotel main tehraaya or jaisi party hoti he waisi hui hogi
 There was a lot of ruckus that your company owes thousands of crores and you are celebrating your birthday in a royal way
 bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar raghuram rajan sahab ne bhi kaha tha ki aap par system kaa lone he
 It seems that you are giving a message to people that you do not mind all these things
 agar aap mushkil main hai to aapako apane kharche kam karne chahie
 Mallya Sahab has an IPL team and has bought the team in the Caribbean Cricket League by paying thirteen and a half crores
 kingfisher ke karmchaariyon ko vetan kaa bakaayaa nahin mila he
 He has written an open letter to Mallya that your hands are colored with blood
 vitt mantri kehete hai ki bainkon ke paas bakaayaa raashi vasuulne ke paryaapt adhikaar hai or sarkaar unke is adhikaar kshetra main koi raajnneetik dakhlandaazi nahin kar rahi he
 Are banks using that right? kahin sarkaar bainkon ko bachaane ke naam par in bade lendaaron ko to nahin bachaa rahi he
 Meanwhile, Vijay Mallya agreed to sell his stake in liquor company United Spirits Ltd to listed company Diageo in London
 iske tahat diajio ne 515 karod rupye vijay maalya ko chukaane hai

 26 farvari ke mail today akhbaar ke anusaar central bank of india ne real estate kii company unitech ke khilaaf saarvajanik notice jari kiya he ki un par 38 karod 53 lakh rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 Unitech's reply was printed that we have paid 264 crores out of 300
 baaki kii rakam jaldi chukaa di jaaegi
 So it is not right that only Mallya saheb is being targeted
 yah sawaal zarur he ki wo koun log hai jin par bainkon ke lakhon karod baaki hai or unke kilaaf yuddh str par karrwai nahin hoti he
 The Indian Express has revealed through RTI that the public sector banks have waived 1 lakh 14 thousand crore rupees in the last three years
 jise angreji main rhite of kehete hai
 Chief Justice of India Justice T
 es
 The bench of Thakur has said that people owe thousands of crores of rupees on public sector banks
 yah sabase bada frod he
 In 2015, ten big banks waived debts of Rs 40,000 crore
 court ne aise lendaaron kii suchi bhi maangi he jinhone 500 karod se adhik ke karz liye hai
 Has any farmer read any such news that his loan has been forgiven
 isliye use upkaar film kaa gaanaa sunanaa chahie or unhen manoj kumaar sahab kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Do not see two bighas of land will cause unnecessary stress
 tippaniyan Last December, when Mallya sahib turned sixty, he gave a party in Goa
 sirf 600 logon ko bulaakar paanch sitara hotel main tehraaya or jaisi party hoti he waisi hui hogi
 There was a lot of ruckus that your company owes thousands of crores and you are celebrating your birthday in a royal way
 bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar raghuram rajan sahab ne bhi kaha tha ki aap par system kaa lone he
 It seems that you are giving a message to people that you do not mind all these things
 agar aap mushkil main hai to aapako apane kharche kam karne chahie
 Mallya Sahab has an IPL team and has bought the team in the Caribbean Cricket League by paying thirteen and a half crores
 kingfisher ke karmchaariyon ko vetan kaa bakaayaa nahin mila he
 He has written an open letter to Mallya that your hands are colored with blood
 vitt mantri kehete hai ki bainkon ke paas bakaayaa raashi vasuulne ke paryaapt adhikaar hai or sarkaar unke is adhikaar kshetra main koi raajnneetik dakhlandaazi nahin kar rahi he
 Are banks using that right? kahin sarkaar bainkon ko bachaane ke naam par in bade lendaaron ko to nahin bachaa rahi he
 Meanwhile, the State Bank of India went against Debt Mallya's debt recovery tribunal
 SBI ne kaha ki diajio company se upi group ke pramotor vijay maalya ko 515 karod rupye mil rahe hai, us par karzdaaron kaa pehla haq hona chahie
 The bank has asked the DRT to take action against Mallya
 DRT ke jaj ne praathamikta ke aadhaar par sabase pehle us yachika ko liya jisamen diajio se mili rakam par pehla haq karzdaataaon kaa bataaya gaya he
 Hola, Vijay Mallya's lawyer, said that his clients are very small defaulters compared to big companies like Reliance
 unka aarope he ki bank chote difoltaron ko pareshaan kar rahe hai jabaki bade difoltaron ko chhod rahe hai
 He cited the Reserve Bank as saying that banks do not take action against big fish
 kai companiyon ne to chalis hazaar karod tak kaa difolt kiya he or unhen kuch nahin hota
 The debtor of 7800 crores describes himself as a small defaulter
 chalis hazaar karod vaale difolter kii taraf ishaara karata he
 You are the one who cannot bear the debt of fifty sixty thousand
 isliye aap 'upkaar' film dekhiye
 Don't watch tv bainkon ne vijay maalya ko lekar sakriyata to dikhaai he lekin kya ve bade lendaaron ke saath bhi vaisaa hi kar rahe hai
 If all this recovery is done, then everyone's accounts will be stirred by loan money before black money
 vijay maalya ne bhi ek patr likhakar apana paksh rakhaa he
 Mallya has written that a campaign is going against him in the media
 unhone kingfisher airlines company antarrashtriya salaahkaaron or esbiai capital market ke moolyankan ke baad launch kii thi
 It is unfortunate that the company could not run due to market and government policies
 31 janvari 2012 ko state bank of india ne bhartiya reserve bank ko yahi likhaa he
 It is not that Kingfisher has not repaid the loan
 1250 karod rupee alag-alag maamalon main karnataka hai court main jamaa hai
 1244 crore cash amount has been recovered by selling shares
 kul milakar 2494 karod kii recovery ho chuki he
 i am in constant touch with the banks and trying to clear the loan at one go
 maine vyaktigat rup se koi karz nahin liya he
 Nor am i a defaulter
 main har kanoonee prakriya main madad kar rahaa hum
 i am being made the poster boy of npas of banks while the npas of banks are 11 lakh crores
 kai lender aise hai jinhone kingfisher se zyada paise liye hai
 None of these defaulters have been made as willful defaulters
 maine adaalat main ise chunauti di he
 We too have lost money
 hamane kingfisher airlines main 4000 karod nivesh kiye the
 The banks have also got some share
 kya bank sirf vijay maalya ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 They are declared willful defaulters

 According to the Mail Today newspaper of 26 February, the Central Bank of India has issued a public notice against Unitech, a real estate company, that they owe Rs 38 crore 53 lakh
 unitech kaa jawaab chapa tha ki hamane 300 main se 264 karod chukaa diye hai
 The remaining amount will be paid soon
 isliye sahi nahin he ki sirf maalya sahab ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The question is definitely who are the people on whom the banks have millions of crores left and action is not taken against them on a war footing
 indian express ne artiai ke zariye pataa kiya he ki sarkari bainkon ne pichley teen saal main 1 lakh 14 hazaar karod rupee maaf kiye hai
 Which is called Right of in English
 bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish justise tii
 s
 thakur kii bench ne kaha he ki logon par sarkari bainkon ke hazaron karod rupee ke karz hai
 This is the biggest fraud
 2015 main das bade bainkon ne 40,000 karod ke karz maaf kar diye
 The court has also sought a list of creditors who have taken loans of more than 500 crores
 kya kisi kisaan ne aisi koi khabar padhi he ki uskaa lone maaf ho gaya
 So he should listen to the song of Upkar and thank Manoj Kumar saheb
 do bigha zamin na denkhen bevajaah tanaav ho jayega

 Called just 600 people and stayed in a five-star hotel and the party would have happened
 ise lekar kaaphi hangaamaa hua ki aapaki company par hazaron karod ke karz he or aap hai ki shahi tareeke se janmdin manaa rahe hai
 Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan Saheb also said that you have a system loan
 aisa lagata he ki aap logon ko massej de rahe hai ki aapako in sab baton se koi fark nahin padataa
 If you are in trouble then you should reduce your expenses
 maalya sahab ke paas ipel kii ek team he or unhone saadhe teraa karod dekar carabinayan cricket lig main team kharidi he
 Kingfisher employees have not received arrears of salary
 unhone maalya ko khulaa patr likhaa he ki maalya ji aapke haath koon se range hai
 The Finance Minister says that banks have sufficient powers to recover dues and the government is not making any political interference in this jurisdiction
 kya bank us adhikaar kaa istamaal kar rahe hai

 kya aap jaanate hai ki hamaare kishor nyaay adhinium, 2015 (juvenil justise act yaa jeje act) ke tahat kisi bhi bachche ke mata-pita ko bal kalyaan samiti (CWC) naamak panel 'ayogy' ghoshit kar saktaa he or bachche ko anivaary rup se sarkari sangrakshan main le ja saktaa he
 
 
 The Do you know that this system has also been applied to newborns and toddlers? Such children taken under government protection can be forcibly kept in foster care or government institutions till the age of 18 years
 CWC aise bacchon ko apane maa-baap se mulaakaat tak karne se roak sakati he
 Is this CWC, well? Actually, it is a panel of five members elected from among the public, who are given the powers of the court, but it does not follow the court standards
 yah faisle suna saktaa he, magar isamen koi nyaayadhish nahin hota
 Retired judges or lawyers can be its members, but their selection is not mandatory
 ekmaatr shart yah he ki uske sadsy bacchon se sambandhit kisi kshetra se hon - masalan adhyaaapak, bal chikitsak, manovaigyanik yaa 'soshiyologist' jaise peshewar, jinke paas taftishi, forencik yaa kanoonee kaabiliyat nahin he
 Under this arrangement, any district level government official or any NGO can separate children from their parents, and for this they will only need the consent of the CWC
 ab aap dekh sakate hai ki jeje act nirdosh pariwaron or unke bacchon ko kis tarah jokhim main daal detaa he
 The power to permanently separate children from their parents is perhaps the most terrible power given to the government after the death penalty
 is tarah kii kathor shaktiyon ko saarvajanik javabdehi ke sabase sakht maanakon ke adheen kiya janaa chahie tha, or inhe saarvajanik praadhikaran kii kavayad se sambandhit kanoonon main prashikshit peshewaron dwaara prayog karwaanaa chahie tha, jo puri tarah jaanate hon ki kis tarah in shaktiyon kaa durupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 In this view, our foster care system has surpassed the foster care laws of many western countries
 zyaadaatar pashchimi deshon main bagaiyr nyaayadhish ke aadesh ke sarkari sansthaaen bachche ko maa-baap se lekar apane sangrakshan main nahin le sakati hai
 The Union Ministry is advocating the adoption of Model Guidelines for Foster Care, 2016 ('foster Care Guidelines') from all states
 in guidelins kii bhashaa ko padhane se saaf he ki iskaa dayera sirf laavarison or chode hue bacchon tak simit nahin he, balki ghar-pariwaron main rah rahe bachche bhi is kanoon ke mukhya lakshyon main hai
 Foster Care Guideline 2
 9 (a) main kaha gaya he ki foster placement ke liye jaivik mata-pita kii sahmati anivaary nahin he or iskaa daaromadar keval 'zarurat' or 'maukey' ke hisaab se tay kiya jayega
 Guidelines mention Foster Parents 'challenges' stating that 'separation from one's family is the most upheaval experience for any child' (appendix g first point)
 isi ke bindu 2
 2
 4 main bataaya gaya he ki bachche ko uske 'paidaayashi parivaar se alag hone' ke bare main 'counselling' di jaani chahie
 It is clear from this that the government is giving the powers to snatch the children in the family from their waking parents
 vaise yah dikhaane ke liye niyamavali main puri saavdhaanee barti gai he ki parivaar ke saath bachche ke punarmilan ko praathamikta di jaaegi; bachche ko uske paidaayashi parivaar ke paas lautaane kaa harsambhav prayaas kiya jayega; pariwaron kii 'sakshmata' vagairah ke liye puraa prayaas kiya jayega
 But such jargon also appears in Western child protection systems
 aisi laffaazi ke baavjood pashchimi deshon main yahi vyavastha lagu karke bilkul saamaanya pariwaron ke bacchon ko nihaayat betuke aadhaaron par unke mata-pita se chin liya jaataa he
 These problems are even more worrisome when you take into account that under our foster care laws, it is not necessary that children be subjected to severe harassment or neglect in order to forcibly separate children from their parents
 iske liye mata-pita kii 'upyuktata' or 'jubaani utpeedan' (varbal abus) masalan daant-dapat, evam 'bhaavnaatmak utpeedan' (imotional abus) jaisi vajahon kaa bhi sahaara liya ja saktaa he
 These unclear and widely draft laws leave much scope for the abuse and harassment of innocent families
 hindi pattee ke teen ahm rajyon main bhartiya janata party ko patkhni dene ke baad ab congress sarkaar banane kii koshishon main jute gai he
 In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Congress got a majority, but it got stuck in the name of the Chief Minister
 rajasthan main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar ashok gahalot, sachin payalat ke naam par charchaa chal rahi he
 The supporters of both leaders are shouting slogans from Delhi to Jaipur
 is bich rajasthan ke vidhayak pi
 r Meena has said that, "if Pilot Pilot is not made the Chief Minister, he will leave the party
 70 se 80 pratishat vidhayak payalat ke saath hai
 "meena also targeted Ashok Gehlot
 unhone kaha ki puure chunaav main sachin payalat ne mehnat kii he
 Therefore, he should be made the chief minister
 gahalot ne ab tak kya kiya?maaloom ho ki congress adhyaksharahul gandhiparyvekshakon se mulaakaat kar charchaa kar rahe hai udhar, rajasthan se nirdaleey vidhayak lagaataar ashok gahalot ke paksh main bayaan de rahe hai
 The legislators say that the people of Rajasthan and their demand is that Ashok Gehlot should be entrusted with the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye dangal ab tej hota ja rahaa he
 Proponents of Sachin Pilot are shouting slogans outside the Congress office in Delhi
 isse pehle jaipur main bhi sachin payalat or ashok gahalot ke samarthakon ne narebaaji kii thi
 It is known that Sachin Pilot is the state president of Rajasthan Congress, under his leadership, the party has won
 samarthak lagaataar sachin payalat ko mukhyamantri banane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Considering the formula of Deputy CM? Congress in Rajasthan is working on the formula of Deputy CM
 aaj ashok gahalot or sachin payalat rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 All the mlas have been asked to stay in Jaipur
 rajasthan main bhi ashok gahalot or sachin payalat ke samarthakon ne jaipur main shakti pradarshan kiya
 But now everyone's eyes are on Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi ke saath jediu kaa rishta khatm karne kaa sharad yadav or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke aupchaarik elaan ke baad bihar bijepi ke netaa susheel modi ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki pichley chaar dinon main aisa kya hua, jo yah gathbandhan tod diya gaya

 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ko endie ke netaa ke rup main chunaa gaya tha, isliye naitikta ke aadhaar par nitish kumaar ko pehle siem pad se istipha dena chahie tha, phir jediu kaa netaa nirvaachit hone ke baad rajyapal se milakar samarthan patr dete
 The comments unhone kaha ki rajya ke har mahatvapurn nirnyon ko laane, lagu karne main bijepi kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 BJP had already assured that the opinion of allies would be taken on PM Post
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki nitish ne janata ke saath vishwasghaat kiya he, isliye 18 june ko bijepi 'bihar band' or 'vishwasghaat diwas' ke rup main manaayegi
 We will appeal to the people of Bihar to avenge this betrayal in the Lok Sabha elections
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki jediu ne sampradayikta kaa mudda apni suvidha ke anuroop tay kiya
 Not a single riot took place in Narendra Modi's state in ten years, but riots took place in Congress ruled states and other states
 unhone kaha ki kuch log narendra modi se ghabara gaye hai
 He said that Nitish Kumar was chosen as the leader of the NDA, therefore, on the basis of morality, Nitish Kumar should have first resigned from the post of CM, then after the JDU leader was elected, he would meet the Governor and give a letter of support
 tippaniyan He said that BJP played an important role in bringing and implementing every important decision of the state
 bijepi ne pehle hi aashwast kiya tha ki piem post par sahyogi dalon kii raay lee jaaegi

 ham bihar kii janata se apil karenge ki loksabhaa ke chunaav main vah is vishwasghaat kaa badla le

 Apply by visiting wo apni choti bahan kii bahut parvaah karata tha
 a few days ago, like every year, he had tied a rakhi on his hand to his sister
 apni bahan ko raksha kaa vachan diya tha
 But what that younger sister did to her brother surprised everyone
 us ladki ne bhai-bahan ke rishte ko hi sharmasaar kar diya
 In the city of Amreli, Gujarat, a minor girl strangled her brother to death
 ladki ko bhai kaa murder karne kaa edia ek tivi sho se mila
 Actually, the brother of the murdered girl was interrupted in her love affair
 isliye ladki ne uskaa galaa kaat daalaa
 Vakil Rameshbhai Arajnabhaika is home in the Chitralod area of the city
 beeti shaam unka 23 varshiya betaa siddharth or 17 varshiya beti nitika (badla hue naam) ghar main akele the
 Meanwhile, suddenly Nikita came out of the house running
 or rote hue chillane lagi ki kisi ne uske bhai kaa murder kar diya he
 When entering the neighboring house, Siddharth's body was found lying in the blood
 police ko soochna di gai
 And when the police questioned Nikita on suspicion basis, the case was opened
 sab log hairaan ho gaye
 Brother's throat was reported to Retapulis with a knife
 mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchi police ne jab muyna kiya to unhen shaq hua ki aakhir ghar main kisi ko pataa chale bina itani safai se siddharth kii hatya kaise kii ja sakati he
 The police questioned the people around
 pataa chalaa ki nitika kaa kisi se afaire he
 And he often quarreled with his brother about this
 iske baad police ne jab sakhti ke saath poochtacha kii to ladki ne apana jurm kabool kar liya
 Planikita, who was watching crime petrol, told the police during interrogation that he had seen the crime petrol show on TV a few days ago
 vahiin se use murder kaa idia aayaa
 She had seen in the episode of the show that a woman makes an excuse to murder her husband
 uski ankhon par pattee baandh detii he phir uske donon haath bhi
 After this, the woman sits her husband in the chair and gives her throat from behind
 thik vaisaa hi nikita ne apane bhai ke saath bhi kiya
 Clothes washed to erase blood stains, the police told the police that when he sat in a chair and cut his brother's throat from the back, he fell to the ground
 isi bich nikita ne uske gale par chaaku se ek ke baad ek kai waar kiye
 Nikita stopped the attack when her body stopped moving
 hatya karte vakt uske kapadon par khun ke dhabbe lag gaye the
 That's why he immediately washed his clothes and put them to dry
 iske baad usne kapade change kiye padosiyon ko bulaane ghar se baahar ai
 Amid growing tension on the indo-pak border, more than 2500 terrorists are preparing to infiltrate into India
 ye aatankwaadi paak adhikrut kashmir sthit aatankwaadi shiviron main hai
 Intelligence reports indicate that 42 terrorist camps are operating across the border, of which 25 are in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and 17 are in other parts of Pakistan
 kendriya grih mantralay ke sutron ne bataaya ki 2500 se adhik aatankwaadi prashikshan, hathiyaar or gola barood ke saath taiyaar ho rahe hai taaki ve bharat main ghuspaith kar saken
 In 2012, at least 90 Pakistani intruders entered through the indo-pak border
 kam se kam 125 aatankwaadi jammu kashmir main us samay pakde gayi, jab ve ghuspaith kar bharat main pravesh kii koshish kar rahe the
 While the number of Pakistani intruders stood at 63 in 2011, the entry of 90 intruders in 2012 raised alarm bells in the Ministry of Home Affairs and thereafter security agencies were asked to increase vigil on the border
 bharat-paak seemaa se 2010 main 94 or 2009 main 69 pakistani ghuspaithiyon ne pravesh kiya
 After Padmavat, Karni Sena will now oppose Kangana Ranot's film Manikarnika
 pehle se hi manikarnika kaa virodh sarv brahman mahasabha kar rahi he
 Actually, when the Karni Sena was opposing Padmavat, the Brahman Mahasabha supported him
 ab manikarnika ke virodh main karani sena bhi uskaa saath degi
 Explain that the Sarva Brahmin Mahasabha in Rajasthan has accused the makers of the film 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' for tarnishing the image of Rani Laxmibai
 kaha he ki kangana kii film main lakshmibai ke britisher ke saath lav sikvence dikhaaya gaya he
 In fact, the organization quoted its sources as claiming that Laxmibai's love affair with the British was in the film
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii padmavat ke baad kisi film ke content ko lekar ye nayaa vivaad he
 By the way, there is no such mention about Laxmibai in the books of traditional history
 haalanki kuch saal pehle ek angreji main ek kitaab ai thi, jisamen lakshmibai ke ek angrej ke saath prem prasang ko pesh kiya gaya tha
 Bad news for Kangana, another film will appear on Manikarnika's first Rani Laxmibai in the book? 10 years ago UK based writer Jayashree Mishra wrote a book called 'rani'
 jayshri ne apni kitaab main rani or jhaansi ke tatkaaleen raajnneetik agent robert elice ke bich afaire kaa zikr kiya
 However, he has made it clear that his book is a historical fiction and love story, which can hurt the sentiments of the Indian people
 kitaab main zikr he ki donon kii dosti ke bare main sirf rani lakshmibai kii sahaayak sundar ko pataa tha
 Jayashree Mishra's book also mentions personal moments between Robert and Alice
 kya angrej se prem karti thim lakshmibai? kitaab main aise hua he zikrabatate chalem ki jayshri mishra kii is vivaadit kitaab par 2008 main upi kii tatkaaleen siem mayawati ne roak laga di thi
 People described it as an insult to the queen of Jhansi
 haalanki online cites par yah kitaab aasaani se kharidi ja rahi he
 The super hit song 'dheere Dheere Se Meri Zindagi Mein Aana' from the 1990 film 'aashiqui' was released in Mumbai
 is gane ko rimek kar dobaaraa banaaya gaya he jisamen ruthik roshan or sonam kapur ne abhinay kiya he
 This song has been composed by Yo Yo Honey Singh
 gane ko release karne ke liye ruthik or sonam khud ek multiplex main aaye
 The old song was composed by Nadeem Shravan and went by Kumar Sanu
 us jamaane kaa ye bahut hi mashhoor or super hit gaanaa tha jo ab yo yo hani singh kii awaz main dobaaraa bana he
 In 1990, the song was filmed on Rahul Roy and Anu Agarwal and the new song will feature Hrithik and Sonam
 tii siries ke bhushan kumaar ne aaj ke darshakon ke liye apane is puraane gane ko nae andaaz main pesh kiya he
 The song has been shot in Turkey
 5 minute ke is gane main ameerajade kii bhoomika main ruthik ko sonam se dhire-dhire pyaar hota he
 The comments gauratlab he ki ruthik or sonam ko darshakon ne ek phone ke vigyaapan main pasand kiya he
 Now these two together as a romantic couple are seen in this song
 is gane kii release par 'aashiqui-3' banane kii baat bhi hui kyonki pichley dinon ruthik ke is film ko karne kii khabar ai thi
 Neither Hrithik nor Bhushan Kumar said anything clearly here

 Very happy or hona bhi chahie akhir kitnon ke naseeb hota he pradhanmantri bananaa
 For two terms

 The country is also involved in your happiness

 The promises which were not completed in the last five years, the promises remained incomplete
 unhen puraa karne kii koshish kijiega
 People have chosen you with great expectations
 koshish kijiega ki ye ummid na toote
 Sir, take special care that this time half the population of the country ie women have played a big role in your victory
 unhone beti bachaao, beti padhaao, ujjwala yojana, svachh bharat abhiyaan or ayushmaan yojana ko dhyaan main rakh kar ek baar phir se aapako chunaa he
 The same Muslim women have also voted on the triple talaq considering your steps
 aise main ab sar aapkaa farz banataa he ki 33 fisadi aarakshan se lekar, mahilaon kii suraksha kaa khaas khyaal rakhen
 Just like you raised your voice against the gang rape in Alwar, you will also take care of the BJP ruled states on the same lines

 To prevent them, you need to change the system

 Those who have been treated from outside there are forced to live on the streets
 un bimaaron ke saath aae logon ke rahane kaa intazaam rajya sarkaar karwaae, is baat kii taaqid kijiega
 Apart from this, there is a need to think deeply about the farmers
 kisaanon ko nae takanic se kheti ke liye trend karnaa ke saath unke fasal ko nirdhaarit nunatam mulya mili ise bhi tay karnaa hoga
 You had already said that you are working on a plan to double the income of farmers
 use bhuuliega mat
 The farmer is growing very much, but growing more is becoming a curse for him
 ve apni upaj sadak par phenkane ko majaboor hai
 Please make some mandis, sir
 kisaan ridh hai hamaare desh kii, unako yun kamazor hota nahin dekh sakate
 Whatever is made for their upliftment, they will do

 Sir hindu-muslim, cow-pakistan is enough
 ab kuch aisa kiijie ki ham sach main duniya ke patal par ek mahashakti ban kar ubharen
 And yes, i am reminding you of one of your promises
 maine suna tha aap ganga ko saaf karne kaa bidaa uthaae hai
 What happened to the cleaning of the Ganges? pradhanmantri ji, ganga phool phenkane or asthiyaan visarjeet karne se gandi nahin hoti he
 It is dirty from sewer of cities and waste from industries
 ganga ko saaf karne ke liye aapako thodaa kathor rukh apnaanaa hoga
 You gave a lot of money in your first term, but sad that the Ganges is still not clean
 aap nayaa savera laaenge desh main
 Where there will be happiness and light
 jahaan araajaktaa nahin hogi
 People will have faith in the justice system
 ek aise viksit desh kii kalpana karte hue main is chitthee ko viraam de rahi hoon
 i do not know whether this letter will reach you or not, but i have tried to give word to the expectations of the people of the country

 The Lok Sabha elections due in 2014 are still delayed, but many BJP veterans have intensified their efforts to contest from this parliamentary seat
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik adhyaksh rajnath singh khud is seat se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk hai
 If the names of Rajnath's close friends are considered, then the names of other claimants have cropped up since his name was discussed
 unke samarthakon ke mutabik rajnath haalanki ek baar mahona seat se vidhansabha kaa chunaav lade the, lekin unhen haar mili thi

 If he has made up his mind to contest this seat, i do not think the names of the remaining candidates have any meaning
 rajdhani ke mahayor dinesh sharma bhi haalanki hameshaa se hi tikat ke daavedaaron main shaamil rahe hai
 According to party strategists, however, the party would never want to take the risk of vacating the post of Mayor of a metropolis like Lucknow and giving Sharma a ticket

 haalanki angadaan ko lekar ab bhi bahut adhik jaagrukta to nahin aayi he lekin acchhee baat bas itani he ki log ab is bare main baat karne lage hai
 Imagine if the lamp of someone's house is extinguished and with one of your decisions, if the light of his house burns again and again, can there be anything better than this? The irony is that we donate kidneys to the people of our home while alive, but even today we are not able to accept organ donation wholeheartedly
 4 ko di nai jindagi18 saal ke deepak dhaketa ke mata-pita ne jo faisla kiya wo vaaki ham sabhi ke liye prerana he
 The 18-year-old Deepak, admitted to the Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, was killed
 indore socity for organ donneton ke sachiv or indore ke sarkari mahatma gandhi memorial medical college ke dean dow
 When Sanjay Dixit got the news of this incident, he inspired Deepak's parents to donate his organs
 unki rajamandi milte hi angon ko jaruratmandon tak pahunchane ke liye shahar main hi teen green coridor banaae gaye or dopaher tak deepak ke dil, liver or donon kidaniyon ko indore ke ek anya aspataal samet, gudgaanv or dilli ke aspataalon main pahunchaa diya gaya
 Deepak's limbs saved the lives of four people
 pehle bhi hue hai prayasdow
 Dixit says that so far 16 kidney, nine liver and five hearts have been donated due to the efforts of the society
 unke anusaar, philhal indore main dil or liver transplant kii suvidha uplabdh nahin he isliye in angon ko ham duusare shaharon main bhej dete hai
 The society has taken a unique initiative to encourage people to contribute
 yah socity angadaan karne vaale vyakti ke parijan kaa teen lakh rupye kaa beemaa karwaati he
 Its effect is also visible
 pichley saal oktober maheene se lekar ab tak indore main nau baar green coridor banaaya gaya he or mrit vyakti ke angon ko dilli, mumbai or gudgaanv main jaruratmandon tak sahi-salaamat pahunchaaya ja chukaa he

 galle ke maidan par pehla test match haar jane ke baad ab bharat ke upar kai sawaal khadey honge
 While till yesterday, cricket pundits were praising India's great game and praising it as deserving of victory, but after this defeat, India will not and should not be entitled to this compliment
 srilanka kii jeet se zyada bharat kii haar par charchaa hogi or captain viraat kohli kii captaini par sawaal uthanaa shuru ho jaaenge jo galat he
 Both teams have played well in this match
 kal tak bharat kaa palada baari tha or aaj srilanka ke shandaar pradarshan kii vajah se use jeet mili, yahi to test match kii sundarataa he
 i am not saying that there should be no question about India's defeat
 duusari pari main bharat kii batting kaaphi niraashajanak thi
 India lost their last 9 wickets in just 89 runs which is a matter of concern
 lekin iske saath-saath hamen srilanka kii gendbaaji or captaini kii bhi tarif kerani chahie
 Both the Sri Lankan spin bowlers won the bowling with great bowling
 srilanka ke yuva spin bowler tharindu kaushal ko is match main 8 wicket mili jo unke kariyar kii sabase behtareen bowling he or rangana herath bhi 7 wicket lene main kaamyaab hue
 No one can forget Dinesh Chandimal's brilliant innings of 162 runs in the second innings
 lekin har match ko haar yaa jeet kii nazariye se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 For India, Shikhar Dhawan and captain Virat Kohli hit a brilliant century in the first innings and r Ashwin also bowled brilliantly, taking 10 wickets in this match which should be appreciated
 lekin agar poocha jaye ki match kii sabase zyada badi baat kya thi to sabase zyada bharat kii haar kii baat aegi, phir srilanka kii jeet kii or alag-alag khilaadiyon ke pradarshan par bhi charchaa hogi
 But in the midst of this defeat and victory, we are forgetting a player who has given a new identity to Sri Lankan cricket and that is Kumar Sangakkara
 sangakaara kaa is maidan par aakhir test match tha
 After Sri Lanka's victory, Sangakkara's happiness has forgotten the grief of India's defeat
 ho saktaa is test match main sangakaara acha na khel paae hon
 But this ground of Gaul has given Sangkara a new identity
 is maidan par sangakaara ne kai behtareen paariyaan kheli hai or srilanka ko jeet bhi dilaayi he
 Sangakkara played the first match of his Test career on 20 July 2000 against South Africa at this ground
 apane test kariyar kaa pehla shatak sangakaara ne is maidan par bharat ke khilaaf 2001 main maaraa tha or srilanka ko is match main jeet bhi mili thi
 The comments sangakaara ne apane kariyar doosraa shatak bhi isi maidan par saal 2001 main west-indies ke khilaaf maaraa tha
 In 2014, Sangakkara had a brilliant innings of 221 runs against Pakistan at this ground while performing a brilliant game
 apane test kariyar ke 38 shatak main se 6 shatak sangakaara ne isi maidan par thoke hai or jab-jab sangakaara ne is maidan par shatak thoka he tab tab srilanka ko is maidan par jeet mili he
 Sangakkara also holds the record for the most runs scored in a Test match for Sri Lanka
 133 test match main kareeb 58 kii ausat se sangakaara ne 12350 ran banaae hai jo ek mahaan khilaadi kaa parichay detaa he
 Sangakkara may not have scored much runs in this Test match but this ground has been lucky for Sangakkara, so how could Sri Lanka lose in Sangakkara's last match on this ground? So many times this Gaul ground has embraced Sangakkara, but this ground has proved that Sangakkara is not only his favorite player but also close to his heart
 is jeet ke saath srilanka kaa sangakaara ke liye isse bada gift koi ho nahin saktaa
 More than Sri Lanka's victory, there will be discussion on India's defeat and the captaincy of captain Virat Kohli will start to be questioned which is wrong
 donon timen is match main acha kheli hai
 Till yesterday, India had the upper hand and today Sri Lanka won due to the brilliant performance, which is the beauty of Test matches
 main yah nahin kah rahaa ki bharat kii haar ke upar sawaal nahin uthanaa chahie
 India's batting in the second innings was quite disappointing
 bharat ne apane aakhri 9 wicket sirf 89 ran main ganvaa die jo chintaa kii baat he
 But at the same time we should also praise the bowling and captaincy of Sri Lanka
 srilanka ke donon spin boleron ne shandaar bowling karte hue jeet dilaai
 Sri Lanka's young spin bowler Tharindu Kaushal got 8 wickets in this match which is the best bowling of his career and Rangana Herath also managed to take 7 wickets
 dinesh chandimal kii duusari pari main 162 ran kii shandaar pari ko to koi bhula nahin saktaa
 But not every match should be viewed from the perspective of defeat or victory
 bharat kii taraf se pehali pari main shikhar dhawan or captain viraat kohli ne shandaar shatak jade or aar asina ne bhi shandaar gendbaaji karte hue is match main 10 wicket liye hai jisaki tarif honi chahie
 But if asked what was the biggest thing of the match, then it would be about India's defeat, then the victory of Sri Lanka and the performance of different players will also be discussed
 lekin is haar-jeet ke bich ham ek aise khilaadi ko bhul rahe hai jisane srilanka ke cricket ko ek nai pahchaan di he or vah he kumaar sangakaara
 Sangakkara finally had a Test match on this ground
 srilanka kii jeet ke baad sangakaara kii kushi ne bharat kii haar kaa dukh bhula diya he
 Sangakkara may not have played well in this Test match
 lekin galle ke is maidan ne sangakaara ko ek nai pahchaan di he
 Sangakkara has played many fine innings at this ground and also won Sri Lanka
 sangakaara ne apane test kariyar kaa pehla match is maidan par 20 july 2000 ko south africa ke khilaaf khelaa tha
 The first century of his Test career, Sangakkara hit this ground against India in 2001 and Sri Lanka also won the match
 tippaniyan Sangakkara also hit his second career century against the West Indies in 2001
 2014 main sangakaara ne shandaar khel kaa pradarshan karte hue pakistan ke khilaaf is maidan par 221 ran kii shandaar pari kheli thi
 Out of 38 centuries in his Test career, 6 centuries have been scored by Sangakkara on this ground and Sri Lanka have won on this ground whenever Sangakkara has scored a century on this ground
 sangakaara ne srilanka ke liye test match main sabase zyada ran banane kaa record bhi kaayam kiya he
 Sangakkara has scored 12350 runs in 133 Test matches at an average of around 58, which makes for a great player
 ho saktaa he sangakaara is test match main koi zyada ran nahin bana paae hon lekin yah maidan sangakaara ke liye bhaagyashaalee rahaa he to phir is maidan par sangakaara ke aakhri match main srilanka kaise haar saktaa tha? aise to kai baar galle ke is maidan ne sangakaara ko gale lagaaya he lekin is maidan ne sangakaara ke aakhri match main srilanka ko gale lagaate hue sabit kar diya ki sangakaara uskaa sirf priy khilaadi nahin balki dil ke kareeb bhi he
 With this win, Sri Lanka cannot have a bigger gift for Sangakkara

 Friends help you solve every small and big problem and that's why you want to share everything with them
 kai baar aap apane partner or apane bich kii bhi kai baaten apane doston ko bataa dete hai lekin kuch baaten aisi hoti hai jinhen aapako apane doston ke saath nahin share kerani chahie
 If your partner only tells you something in secret, then keep it to yourself
 ho saktaa he ki un baton ko aapke doston ko bataane se kisi kaa kuch nuksaan naa hota hon lekin kai baar ye aapke partner kaa bharosa khatm karne kii vajah ban sakati he
 Do not talk to your friends about your partner's personal life, job or family problems
 agar aapkaa partner aapako apni tasviren bhejte hai to unhen apane doston ko naa dikhaaen
 The same applies to your sex life
 apni sex life ke bare main baat karte samay thodi saavdhaanee baraten
 Do not share what your partner thinks about your friends with your friends
 aapke partner ke dimag main kya chal rahaa he, sab kuch dusron ke saath share karne kii jarurat nahin he
 If you know about any weakness or insecurity of your partner, then do not discuss it in front of your friends even if they are not judgmental at all
 agar aap apane doston ko manaa karke apane partner ke saath kahin jate hai to unhen is bare main bataakar unki naaraazgi mol naa len
 If your partner has problems related to money and both of you are facing it then keep this thing in your midst
 apane partner kii ateet yaa unke relationships ke bare main doston se charchaa naa karen
 You may have accepted your partner's past, but not necessarily your friends
 apane doston se partner se hui ladaai ke bare main baat karnaa galat baat nahin he lekin har chote-moti bahes ko bhi unke paas naa le jaaen
 Do not complain to friends about the problems happening in your in-laws, as it can hurt your partner when it is detected
 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne mexico ke apane samakaksh ko phone kar dhamkaate hue kaha he ki agar mexico kii sena apane desh ke 'gande logon' ko kaabo main karne ke liye kuch or nahin karegi to america is kaam ke liye apni sena bhejne ke liye taiyaar he
 Trump had used the phrase 'bad homers' (dirty people) for Mexico's 'drug smugglers and bad guys' in a presidential debate in October and pledged to rid America of them
 'da associat press' ko america ke raashtrapati trump or mexico kerashtrapati enrik pena nitoke bich shuukravaar subah phone par hui baatcheet ke kuch ansh mili hai
 However, it does not mention in detail to whom Trump is using the word 'dirty people' and neither has he explained the tone and perspective of his remarks
 baatcheet ke ye durlabh or chaunkaane vaale ansh is baat kaa khulaasa karte hai ki naerashtrapati trumpaki band daravaajon ke peeche kootneeti kis tarah kii he
 Trump's remarks suggest that he is also interacting with world leaders in the same tone and tone as he did in his rallies during his election campaign
 white house ke pravaktaa ne is tippanee par koi pratikriya nahin di
 The government of Mexico stated that this description was not correct
 26 janvari ko bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke maamle main emenes pramukh raaj thakare abtak aaazaad gum rahe hai jabaki unke khilaaf pune ke do police thanon main exiaar darj ho chuki he
 However, today Raj Thackeray is going on a 2-day visit to Pune and in such a situation, the big question is whether Raj will be arrested
 kya salaakhon ke peeche jaaenge maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke adhyaksh raaj thakare
 The question is big, at which there is no concrete answer at the moment
 lekin ek do dinon main jawaab saamne aa saktaa he kyonki raaj thakare aaj do din ke daure par pune pahunchane vaale hai
 The same Pune where an FIR has been registered against Raj Thackeray for making inflammatory speech
 raaj thakare ke khilaaf pune ke do police thanon loni kalbhor or rajjagad main dhara 109 ke tahat cese daakhil kiya ja chukaa he
 It is possible that during which Raj will be present in Pune, the police there can take any strict action against him
 pune police ne bhi maan liya he ki 26 janvari ke navi mumbai main raaj thakare ne ek aisa bhadakaau bhaashan diya tha jiske baad rajyabar main emenes kaaryakartaaon ne darjanon tolaa naakon par jamkar utpaat machaaya or ji bharkar barbaadi kii
 Within a few hours of Raj Thackeray's speech, the MNS soldiers had started their arbitrary toll points and created a ruckus on 36 toll points within 3 days
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki maharashtra sarkaar ne bhi raaj thakare ke bhaashan kii jaanch ke aadesh die lekin karrwai karne kii himmat abtak nahin juta pai he
 But now, FIA is also registered against Raj Thackeray
 dekhnaa he ki rajya sarkaar iske baad kitni himmat dikhaai he

 This change can neither be defined nor challenged
 aalochak modinomics ko mahaj prachaar bataa rahe hai
 In such a situation, showy events like Vibrant Gujarat Sammelan expose poor performance in the real things that bring changes in the life of the common man
 congress or baaki dalon ne narendra modi ke gujarat model kaa pardaafash karne ko apane chunavi agenda main sabase upar rakhaa he
 But there is no doubt that for the first time, the mathematics of caste and culture is not the only issue for debate before the voter, but also the theory of development presented by the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) prime ministerial contender
 to aaie dekhen ki asal main ye gujarat model kya he? kya yah kargar he? or agar yah kargar he to bhi baaki bharat ke liye yah kaam kaa he yaa nahin?gujarat main kadam rakhte hi sabase pehle najar chaudee sadakon, gaanv main lahalhate kheton or kisi bade mahanagareey shahar ko takkar detii ahmedabad ke kuch hisson kii shaano-shaukat par padati he
 This is the Gujarat that has brought tremendous economic growth
 2004 or 2012 ke bich rajya kii vruddhi dar 10
 1 percent, while the national average is 7
 6 fisadi kaa tha
 But if we walk a bit away from these well-manicured roads and glittering highways, a different picture emerges
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki buniyadi dhaanche, nivesh or i-gavarnence ke maamle main gujarat model kaamyaab rahaa he, lekin uski apni simaaen hai
 These limitations are highlighted by the failure to provide better treatment to the common man and failure in education
 aaj bhi navjaat bacchon kii maut or auraton kii sakshartaa ke maamle main gujarat duusare rajyon se peeche he
 But the question is also how responsible Modi's policies are for the failure or success in this? After wandering far and wide in various parts of Gujarat and interacting with government officials and economists, India Today identified four key principles of governance in Gujarat today: - Emphasis on changing the methods of farming and a keen eye on industry 
 -ilaaj or padhai-likhaai jaise kshetron main nijee udhyam ko badhaava
 - Infrastructure like cities in villages too
 -sarkaar kaa vikendrit model jisamen yojanaayen sthaneey aabaadi kii jarurat or maang ke hisaab se banaai jaaen
 Through these principles, Modi's plans for India can be drawn
 kheti main badlavsarak, bijli or panigujrat kii modi vikaas gaatha mul rup se is sidhe-sade nitigat faisle par tiki he ki har kisi ko sadak, bijli or pani mili
 The effective scheme here is Jyotigram scheme
 2006 main shuru kii gai is yojana se gujarat ke 18,000 gaanvon ko sinchai ke liye aath ghante bijli or ghar ke liye 24 ghante bijli milti he
 So far this scheme has been implemented in 97% villages
 sadaken acchhee hone se kisaan mandi tak aasaani se pahunch sakate hai
 One can find resources to grow more than one crop and to run dairy
 sinchai ke nae tareekon khaskar checkdam ke nirmaan ke bal par gujarat ne sanï 2000 ke baad se desh ke sabhi rajyon main sabase tej yani 9
 6 percent growth is recorded
 gujarat main ghumen to badlaav ke kai nishaan dikhaai dete hai
 Farmers in Valia tehsil said that the pomegranate, which was grown only in the northern part of the state and flourished thrice a year, has now been added to the rich crop of papaya, banana, sugarcane and chiku in this area
 surat or bhadooch ke liye sahaayak bagbani nideshak dinesh padalia ke anusaar har taluka main bagwani adhikari kii tainaati se kisaanon ko phayda hua he
 The state government is promoting dairy farming with this arrangement
 kapaas jaisi nakadi fasal, zyada kamai dene vaale maveshi, fal or subjiyan tathaa gehun kii vajah se zyada tarakkee hui he, kyonki inaki upaj or mulya teji se kai guna ho gaya he
 But can this demonstration of farming be repeated in other states? According to Apoorva Ojha, Chief Executive Officer of the Aga Khan Rural Assistance Program in Gujarat for several years, the cost of the Jyotigram scheme is Rs 2,000 crore
 he
 He says, "even if you add the inflation rate to it, the cost of adopting this scheme across the country is about Rs 65,000 crore
 aegi
 "this amount is large, but arrangements can be made
" 2014-15 main sirf eendhan kii sabsidi ke liye kul 65,000 karod ru
 are placed
 gujarat main kheti main tarakkee kaa ek or pahalu bhi he
 On one hand the yield increased and on the other hand the number of farmers decreased
 yani kam kisaan ab zyada kamai kar rahe hai
 This is a good sign in itself
 bharat main logon ko kheti se hataa kar gaanvon main paaramparik sarvice sector yaa shaharon main udyog se jude sarvice sector main lagane kii jarurat he
 According to the 2011 census, 3 out of 10 farmers in Gujarat in 10 years
 55 lakh kii kami ai he, lekin berozegaar khetihar mazdooron kii sankhya usee anupaat main badi he
 According to the census data, the number of industrial workers in Gujarat has increased by more than 22 lakhs during this period
 iskaa matlab gaanvon se badi sankhya main log shaharon main jaakar kaam karne lage hai
 If all of this happened in the whole country, then along with increasing agricultural yields, employment opportunities in non-agricultural sectors would have to be increased
 yani ek aisa dhaancha khadaa karnaa hoga jisamen kheti munaafe kaa sauda ho or kheti se baahar hue log baaki kaam-dhandhon main behatar aajeevika paa saken
 a new type of urbanization in the state, the story of modernization in the villages, at a function in Ahmedabad in 2011, Modi acknowledged that there is a problem of migration of large numbers of people to the cities

 According to Modi, the kind of civic and basic facilities are available to the cities, the same facilities are provided to the villages
 aisa karke ve ek tarah se gaanv kii aatma ko jinda rakhana chaahate hai
 The scheme started in 2011, so its ground results are difficult to see, especially in the tribal areas of Gujarat
 phir bhi isse buniyadi dhanchaagat suvidhaon main sudhaar kii vachanabaddhata to dikhti he
 In many cases, from Antasubah in Ahmedabad to adjoining Khorj in North Gujarat, basic amenities have improved, whether it be new schools, hospital buildings or concrete roads
 lekin yah gaanvon kaa shaharikaran deshbhar main chal rahe isi tarah ke gramin vikaas kaaryakramon se alag nahin he
 Therefore, the question cannot arise whether it can be adopted nationwide
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah vichaar sabase pehle doctor e

 Abdul Kalam gave it as President
 unhone ise puraa (piyuare) yani gaanv ke ilaakon main shahari suvidhaayen dena kaha tha
 Industry land and incentives a major aspect of the various types of infrastructure in Gujarat is that the government has adopted concrete measures for industries
 rajya kii audyogic vruddhi dar 2005-09 ke dauraan badhkar 12
 65 per cent, just 3 during 2001-04
 95 pratishat thi
 Much of the credit for this goes to the government's policy that large companies were supported by the availability of basic amenities and land

 There is a merit-based support package for basic infrastructure projects with investment of Rs

 unka kahana tha ki is samay kaarobaar badaae kii jo raftaar 10 fisadi he, vah, ''sarkari madad se doguni” ho sakati he
 Decentralization: Since 2005, Gujarat has adopted many schemes to decentralize power and make essential services reach people in villages
 yojanaon kaa prasar karne kaa tarika bhi niraala he
 To interact with the villagers, a fair is organized
 misaal ke taur par krishi mahotsav meley main vaigyanik, sarkari adhikari or krishi visheshgy gaanv pahunchakar kisaanon ko drip sinchai, mitti ke pareekshan, barsaat kaa pani ikattha karne ke bare main jaankaree dete hai
 The government also organizes two festivals
 inamen se 'kanya kelaavani’ kaa makasad zyada se zyada ladakiyon kaa skool main daakhila karnaa he
 At the same time, 'gunotsav' is celebrated every year to assess the quality of primary education
 in yojanaon ke antargat mantri or sarkari afasar sabhi 18,000 gaanvon main jate hai
 After spending three days there, survey the schools and talk to the families about the need to teach girls, because there is less trend of teaching girls in tribal areas
 in kaaryakramon kii madad se primary skool main nae admician kii sankhya pehle ke 73 fisadi se badhkar 2012 main 85
 3 percent
 in yojanaon kii sabase badi takat ''apano talluko, wibrant talluko” naam se sthaneey prashasan kii majboot vyavastha he
 Another aspect of decentralization is the deliberate use of local authorities in planning for tribal and coastal populations according to region-specific needs
 2005 main shuru hui vanabandhu kalyaan yojana aisi hi ek yojana he
 It coordinates the functioning of many government departments, so that the schemes can be molded according to the needs of the tribal population
 tateey aabaadi ke liye sagar khedu yojana bhi isi model par chalati he
 According to government data, between 2007 and 2012, the Vanbandhu scheme employed about 10,000 such people, who failed the Class x or XII examinations
 iske alaava rajya kii 42 adivasee tahseelon main 50 nae skool bhi khule
 Can this model of decentralization be adopted across the country? Economist Bibek Debroy says, "gujarat has a healthy tradition of Panchayati Raj since the 1960s, due to which the plan for decentralization becomes easy
 ” anya rajyon main apnaane ke liye sabase pehle sthaneey swashaasan ko majboot karnaa hoga
 That is, the basic question will come that the people of the rest of the country should first be made aware that it is in their best interest

 The e-land project of the revenue department has digitized the records of the land of about half the owners in Gujarat
 isse jameen ke malikana haq main herapheri ke maamle bahut kam ho gaye hai
 The most unique scheme is probably the welcome online grievance redressal system established in the Chief Minister's Office
 modi har chauthe shanivaar ko kareeb chaar ghante tak gaanvvaalon kii shikaayatein khud sunate hai or unka online samaadhaan karte hai
 But after becoming a prime ministerial candidate for a year here, how much time he would have been able to get out for these works is difficult to say
 gujarat main kai i-prashasan yojanaayen lagu karne vaale pankaj gupta pehle tata kansaltency services ke pramukh the
 According to Gupta, the cost of implementation of these schemes has been kept low
 unhone bataaya, ''rajya main 2003 se apanaae gaye aath bade or kareeb ek darjan chote projects kii laagat kareeb 1,200 karod ru

 According to data from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for 2012, there was a shortage of 34 per cent of doctors in public health centers in Gujarat, compared to a national average of 10 per cent
 ahmedabad se kareeb 150 kimi uttar main bhiloda gaanv main ek sarkari aspataal, rajya ke gaanvon main janaswasthya seva kii sthiti bayaan karata he
 There was a queue of patients outside a room on the bottom floor, so the lab technician told that there is only one medical officer in the 98-bed hospital
 kareeb 400 marij rojaanaa aspataal main aate hai
 To overcome this shortage of doctors, the government is giving people the option of getting treatment in private health centers
 mukhyamantri amritam yojana main garibi rekha se neeche ke pariwaron ke adhik se adhik paanch sadsy sarkari manjuuri vaale nijee aspataalon main do lakh ru
 While the Chiranjeevi scheme encourages women to deliver in private hospitals

 The infant mortality rate in Gujarat was 38 in 2012, lower than the national average of 42 but higher than states such as Tamil Nadu (21) and Maharashtra (25)
 matra mrityu dar yani prati 10,000 prasavon par prasav ke dauraan marati mahilaon kii sankhya gujarat main 122, kerala main 66 or maharashtra main 87 hai
 But one reason for this is that 15 percent of the tribal population lives in remote areas
 vaise yahaan sawaal yah bhi he ki kya kerala or maharashtra ke adivasee shahar se sate gaanvon main hi rahete hai?abhi haal tak gaanvon main doctor 1

 The government has now increased this bond more than three times to Rs 5 lakh

 Some of these shortcomings have been overcome by 24 per cent increase in plan expenditure in the state budget for 2013-14 on health

 The facilities of Government Primary School in Navbhavnath village in North Gujarat are worth visiting

 The teachers in this school are covered under the Vidya Sahayak Yojana, which includes Rs 5,300

 The opposition Congress has long termed it as open exploitation of teachers
 bijepi mahasachiv amit shah ne india today conklev main congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ke sawaal par yah baat kabool kii thi
 However, he made it clear that those teachers stayed part-time for four years and were made permanent thereafter

 Such teachers are generally educated, but their mind keeps on searching for better employment
 yahi samasya jab skool se college str ke adhyapakon tak pahunchati he to or bhi bhayaavah ho jaati he
 According to a 2013 report, over 1,700 posts were vacant in engineering colleges across Gujarat
 ise sudhaarney kaa iraadaa pakkaa he
 The government has increased the number of universities in the state from 15 to 52 since Modi came to power
 phir bhi shikshakon kii kami ke kaaran ab tak khaas phayda nahin hua he
 In 2013-14, the government increased plan spending on education by 43 percent
 sarkaar kii in sari pahal ko bahut sakaaratmak nazariye se dekha jaae to bhi aaj tak gujarat kii chhavi behatar profeshnal, vaigyanik, doctor yaa ejeeniyar paidaa karne vaale rajya kii nahin bani he
 There is no strong perception about Gujarat in terms of dominance in administrative services
 vigyaan ke maamle main aaj bhi dakshin ke rajyon ke dabadabe vaali dharna kaayam he
 The English classes also dominate the administrative examinations
 gujarat kii chhavi aaj bhi behatar kaarobaari or vyapaaree paidaa karne vaale rajya kii he
 This image is not bad, but if education is considered a criterion of merit, then Gujarat will look backward
 balki is maamle main to apekshaakrit pichde rajya bihar kaa uttari ilaaka or bengal hameshaa se chhap chodta rahaa he
 Gujarat can learn from them
 faislamanzil abhi dur hearthshastriyon kaa maananaa he ki gujarat ko adarsh paristhitiyon kaa laabh mila he—sarkaar ke paas audyogic gharaanon ko dene ke liye bahut sari jameen kaa hona, sadak banane ke liye anukool jameen hona or gujaratiyon kaa kaarobaari hunar kamyaabi kii pakki guarantee he
 It cannot be denied that under Modi's leadership, Gujarat has given a big boost to basic amenities
 isse kheti kaa rup badal gaya he or dhire-dhire gujarat ke gaanvon kaa cheharaa badal rahaa he
 It may be difficult to replicate economic growth in other states to such an extent
 gujarat ne jis daur main 10
 Achieved a growth rate of 1 percent at that time in two states — Maharashtra (10
 8 fisadi) or tamilnadu (10
 3 per cent) - only beat him

 The services can be easily adopted across India and the adoption of technology across India
 lekin jab tak unke saath achche doctor, achche shikshak or kushal staff dene kaa sankalp nahin hoga, tab tak saamaajik sanketak pichhadate rahenge
 The government has tried to increase the bond for doctors and increase the number of universities
 iske baavjood saamaajik sanketak sudharne main lanbaa vakt lagata he or aaj kiye gaye nivesh kaa laabh ek dashak yaa uske bhi baad main milegaa
 Two things are clear that Gujarat is not yet an ideal state as Modi's supporters would believe, nor is it as scattered as Kejriwal and other leaders say
 agar vishesh rup se swasthya or shiksha jaisi kuch samasyaayein dur kar di jaaen to gujarat aadhunik bhartiya rajya kii aisi misaal ban saktaa he, jise duusare rajya apana sakate hai
 (ahmedabad-vadodara Expressway in Gujarat) But there is one more thing to be remembered in this whole analysis - whatever scale Gujarat government, independent organizations and international organizations have adopted to measure development, the society in poverty-rich, village-city or It has been seen in divisions like men and women
 jitne bhi paimaanon kii charchaa yahaan kii gai he usamen sampradaay yaa dharm ko puri tarah soch-vichaar se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Whereas communalism or simply, injustice to Muslims has been the biggest topic of criticism of Narendra Modi
 modi jise vikaas model kehete hai, usee model ko baghawat ke dinon main uma bharti ne vinaash model or media kaa phulayaa gubbaaraa kaha tha
 And when this model has to be attacked, the opposition directly connects it to the riot model
 kuch virdohi netaa yah bhi daleel dete hai ki modi kaa virodh karke koi musalmaan gujarat main nahin rah saktaa
 May be these things are baseless, but even this general election is being held on perception, propaganda and dreams instead of basics

 As expected, Reliance Jio has extended the last date of becoming a prime member till April 15
 iske saath hi Jio ne samar sarprise ofer kaa bhi elaan kar diya he
 After this, there are many questions in the minds of live users
 kyonki bataaya ja rahaa he ki ab teen maheene tak ke liye phir se sarvice free milegi
 But free is nothing
 yugers ke man main ye sawaal honge ki agar prime member ban gaye to kya hoga ab? agar 99 rupee kaa hi richarge karaayaa he to kya hoga? 303 vaala richarge nahin karaayaa to kya hoga? 149 rupee vaala richarge karaayaa to kya hoga?aise hi sawaalon ke jawaab yahaan aap aasaan shabdon main samaj lijie
 What is summer surprise offer? samar sarprise ofer ke tahat free sarvice ko teen maheene tak keliye badhaayaa gaya he
 But it has its conditions
 shart ye he ki agar aapane is elaan ke pehle prime member kii sabsakripshan kara lee he or saath hi 303 rupee kaa richarge kara liya he, to yah july 2017 se lagu hoga
 Prior to this, service data and calling will continue to be available for three months
 teen maheene baad 303 rupee vaala pack shuru ho jayega
 Only applicable on packs of Rs
 303 or above
 Summer surprisesummer Surprise Offer is only for those customers who have recharged with packs of 303 or more with Prime Service
 agar aapane prime membership lekar 149 rupee kaa richarge karaayaa he to jeeyo ap ke jariye phir se 303 rupee kaa richarge karana hoga
 This means that if you want a free offer then it will be necessary to recharge the 303 after the subscription of Rs 99
 agar 149 rupee ke pack saath richarge karte hai to standard tarriff legenge
 What will happen to the recharge of Rs 149, if you have already recharged Rs 149, then it will not end, but this plan will be implemented after the summer surprise offer ends
 is plan main sirf 2GB data milegaa
 If you do not recharge Rs 303 and only Rs 99 is recharged, what will happen? Prime members will be made, but will not be able to use unlimited service
 samar sarprise ofer bhi aapako nahin milegaa
 That is, a recharge of Rs 303 is necessary for summer surprise
 kul milakar baat yah he ki ab 149 rupee se aapkaa kaam nahinchalegaa
 Recharge of Rs 303 will be necessary, otherwise summer surprise off will not be available
 99 rupee kaa hi richarge karaayaa or kuch bhi nahin karaayaa15 april tak koi richarge nahin karaayaa to teen maheene ke bheetar aapkaa sim kaam karnaa band kar degaa
 Data will not be available and will not be able to make calls
 ab aap khud andaja laga lijie ki aapke 99 rupee gaye kahaan

 " unhone kaha, "tamaam nagarikon ne bhi isi tarah kii ichha jaahir kii he
 It shows his love and affection for me and his aspiration
 main vaaki main is samarthan se gadgad hum
 i respect all these aspirations
 unhone mere upar jo bharosa kiya he, uske liye main unhen dhanyavad dena chahta hum
 " kalam ne aage kaha, "maine is maamle par or maujuuda raajnneetik halaat par samagrata se vichaar kiya or 2012 kaa chunaav na ladane kaa nishchay kiya
 " sutron kaa kahana he ki kalam ne apane is faisle kii jaankaree sabase pehle bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ko di
 Advani called Kalam twice and requested him to contest the presidential election
 adwani ke sahyogi sudhindra kulkarni ne bhi is silsile main somvaar ko kalam se do baar mulaakaat kii
 Kalam's declaration of not contesting elections is considered a major setback for the Trinamool Congress as it had first sought the appointment of Kalam with Samajwadi Party (SP) as President
 trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee ne to unhen pehle hi badhai bhi de di thi
 Now after Kalam's announcement of not contesting elections, all eyes are on NDA to decide what he decides
 uske paas ab do hi vikalp bache hai
 The first is to support Mukherjee and the second is to form a consensus among allies in the name of former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma
 kyonki biju janata dal (bijd) or ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke) abhi bhi unke samarthan main hai
 It is another matter that his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is not supporting him
 udhar, nitish kumaar ne patna main kaha ki raashtrapati ke chunaav ke maamle par vah aam sahmati ke pakshdhar hai, haalanki isamen kaaphi It's late unhone kaha ki rajg main bhi aam sahmati banane par vichaar chal rahaa he
 When asked about the candidate, he said that it is not appropriate to speak in the meeting in the NDA
 is bich, trinmul congress ne saaf kiya ki centre sarkaar se uske mantriyon ke istife dene kii khabaron main tanik bhi sachai nahin he
 He made it clear that the Trinamool Congress will continue to support the UPA government, even if it wants to oust their party
 trinmul congress ke saansadon va vidhayakon kii ek baithak ke baad uske varisht netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne kolkata main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "aisi khabaren chal rahi hai ki trinmul congress ke mantriyon ne centre sarkaar se istipha de diya he or apane istife mamata ko saunp die hai
 There is no truth at all in these reports
 hamaara iraadaa sarkaar giraane kaa nahin he
 Yes, we will not be difficult for him
 "tippaniyan Bandopadhyay said, “our mps are mentally ready to resign
 jab bhi mamata banerjee kahengi, sabhi istipha de denge
 "he said," We still want former President Dr
 apije abdul kalam desh ke raashtrapati bane
 There is still time left in the presidential election
 ham sahi samay par sahi faisla lenge
 " mamata ke saath kalam kaa naam sabase pehle lene vaale sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par kalam ke naam par vichaar karne kii sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue kaha ki ab raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaaron par vichaar karne kaa adhyay band ho chukaa he
 The Congress, while praising Kalam's decision not to contest the elections, sought support from the Trinamool Congress for Mukherjee
 kalam ne ghoshnaa kii ki unhone puure maamle kaa adhyayan karne ke baad raashtrapati chunaav na ladane kaa nirnay liya
 Kalam said in his statement, "you are aware of the developments going on in the presidential election
 yadhyapi maine ek or kaarykaal ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa or na chunaav ladane main ruchi hi jaahir kii, lekin trinmul congress kii adhyaksh mamata banerjee or anya raajnneetik dal mujhe apana ummidavaar bananaa chaahate the
 "he said," many citizens have expressed a similar desire
 yah mere prati unke prem or lagaav ko tathaa unki aakanksha ko jaahir karata he
 i am really stunned by this support
 main in sabhi aakankshaon kaa aadar karata hum
 i want to thank them for the trust they have placed in me
 " Kalam further said, "I thought over the matter and the current political situation in totality and decided not to contest the 2012 election
 " Sources say that Kalam first informed about this decision to senior BJP leader LK Advani
 adwani ne kalam ko do baar phone kiya or unase raashtrapati chunaav ladane kaa aagrah kiya
 Advani's aide Sudhindra Kulkarni also met Kalam twice in this regard on Monday
 kalam ke chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa trinmul congress ke liye bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he kyonki sabase pehle usne hi samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke saath kalam ko raashtrapati banaae jane kii maang kii thi
 Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee had already congratulated her
 ab kalam ke chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa ke baad sabaki nigahen endie par tik gai he ki vah kya faisla letaa he
 He now has only two options left
 pehla ki mukherjee kaa samarthan kiya jaae or doosraa purv loksabhaa adhyaksh pie sangama ke naam par sahyogi dalon main sahmati banaai jaae
 Because Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) are still in his support
 yah alag baat he ki unki rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) hi unka samarthan nahin kar rahi he
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar said in Patna that he is in favor of consensus on the matter of the election of the President, although there is a lot of der ho gai he
 He said that a consensus is on to form a consensus in the NDA
 unase ummidavaar ke vishay main puche jane par unhone kaha ki abhi rajg main baithak chal rahi he aise main unka bolnaa uchit nahin he
 Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress made it clear that there is no truth in the news of the resignation of its ministers from the central government
 usne spasht kiya ki trinmul congress kaa samprag sarkaar ko samarthan jari rahegaa, bhale hi vah chaahe to unki party ko nikaal baahar kare
 After a meeting of Trinamool Congress mps and mlas, its senior leader Sudeep Bandopadhyay told reporters in Kolkata, "there are reports that Trinamool Congress ministers have resigned from the central government and submitted their resignations to Mamata 
 in khabaron main tanik bhi sachai nahin he

 "comments bandopadhyaay ne kaha, "hamaare saansad istipha dene ko maansik rup se taiyaar hai

 " SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who took the first name of Kalam along with Mamta, denied the possibility of considering Kalam as the presidential candidate, saying that the chapter to consider the presidential candidates has now closed is

 Beni Prasad Verma later regretted this disputed statement

 jiske baad sapa netaa shivpal yadav ne kendriya mantri par ‘opium kii taskari karne’ or charas istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya

 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who has been surrounded by controversies many times with his impeccable opinion, has again raised new questions in the interview to Manoranjan Bharti, political editor of NDTV India
 is baar unhone gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se kai sidhe or tikhe sawaal puche hai
 He says that the women's honor of Modi is just a sham or else he would have made Sushma Swaraj the prime ministerial candidate
 unhone gujarat ke vikaas ke modi ke daawey par bhi sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Presenting this entire conversation
 manoranjan bharti− aapane kaha tha ki do power centre uchit nahin he
 Why did the Congress party have to backtrack later? digvijay singh− meraa sandarbh post 2014 se he, pre 2014 se nahin
 Manoranjan Bharti- This means that you agree with the arrangement now? digvijay singh− chal hi rahaa he
 Manoranjan Bharati - If a student of political science says that there are no two power centers, then what is wrong with it? digvijay singh− ye to ab party main dibet hogi tab puuchhenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - All the veteran leaders of the party have said off the record that there should not be two power centers in the party
 digvijay singh− agar aapane yah baat kahi he to hamaari party ke jitne varisht netaa hai unhonen kaha hoga
 Manoranjan Bharti- Should one person hold the post of PM and party in 2014? digvijay singh− ye to bada hipothetical prashn he kyonki 2014 main bahumat hamen milegaa
 Our government will be formed
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar banegi
 It is not clear which parties will be our allies
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par 2014 main hi ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh
 aap mulaayam singh par kis had tak bharosa kar sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to rata-rataa speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that spoiled the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 He says that the women's honor of Modi is just a sham or else he would have made Sushma Swaraj the prime ministerial candidate
 unhone gujarat ke vikaas ke modi ke daawey par bhi sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Presenting this entire conversation
 manoranjan bharti− aapane kaha tha ki do power centre uchit nahin he
 Why did the Congress party have to backtrack later? digvijay singh− meraa sandarbh post 2014 se he, pre 2014 se nahin
 Manoranjan Bharti- This means that you agree with the arrangement now? digvijay singh− chal hi rahaa he
 Manoranjan Bharati - If a student of political science says that there are no two power centers, then what is wrong with it? digvijay singh− ye to ab party main dibet hogi tab puuchhenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - All the veteran leaders of the party have said off the record that there should not be two power centers in the party
 digvijay singh− agar aapane yah baat kahi he to hamaari party ke jitne varisht netaa hai unhonen kaha hoga
 Manoranjan Bharti- Should one person hold the post of PM and party in 2014? digvijay singh− ye to bada hipothetical prashn he kyonki 2014 main bahumat hamen milegaa
 Our government will be formed
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar banegi
 It is not clear which parties will be our allies
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par 2014 main hi ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh
 aap mulaayam singh par kis had tak bharosa kar sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to rata-rataa speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he

 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that spoiled the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Manoranjan Bharati- You said that two power centers are not appropriate
 baad main aakhir kyon kangras party ko bekatrack karnaa padaa
 Digvijay Singh- My reference is from post 2014, not pre 2014
 manoranjan bharti− iskaa matlab he ki jo abhi vyavastha he usase aap sahamat hai? Digvijay Singh - is going on
 manoranjan bharti− yadi raajnneeti vigyaan kaa koi chaatr do power centre naa hone kii baat kahe to isamen galat kya he? Digvijay Singh - He will be debated in the party now, then he will ask
 manoranjan bharti− party ke sabhi diggaj netaaon ne of da record kaha he ki party main do power centre nahin hone chahie
 Digvijay Singh- If you have said this, then all the senior leaders of our party are said
 manoranjan bharti− kya 2014 main piem pad or party kii satta ek vyakti ke haath main honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh- This is a big hypothetical question because we will get majority in 2014
 hamaari sarkaar banegi
 a coalition government will be formed
 koun si partiyaan hamaari sahyogi hogi, ye abhi spasht nahin he
 Depending on the circumstances, the strategy will be decided in 2014 itself
 manoranjan bharti− kya chunaav samay se pehle ho sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - i do not think the election will be premature
 manoranjan bharti− uttar pradesh ko aap deal karte hai
 To what extent can you trust Mulayam Singh? digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
 kya aap maanate hai is theuri ko? Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharati - You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 digvijay singh− meraa sandarbh post 2014 se he, pre 2014 se nahin
 Manoranjan Bharti- This means that you agree with the arrangement now? digvijay singh− chal hi rahaa he
 Manoranjan Bharati - If a student of political science says that there are no two power centers, then what is wrong with it? digvijay singh− ye to ab party main dibet hogi tab puuchhenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - All the veteran leaders of the party have said off the record that there should not be two power centers in the party
 digvijay singh− agar aapane yah baat kahi he to hamaari party ke jitne varisht netaa hai unhonen kaha hoga
 Manoranjan Bharti- Should one person hold the post of PM and party in 2014? digvijay singh− ye to bada hipothetical prashn he kyonki 2014 main bahumat hamen milegaa
 Our government will be formed
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar banegi
 It is not clear which parties will be our allies
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par 2014 main hi ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh
 aap mulaayam singh par kis had tak bharosa kar sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to rata-rataa speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that spoiled the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Manoranjan Bharti- This means that you agree with the arrangement now? digvijay singh− chal hi rahaa he
 Manoranjan Bharati - If a student of political science says that there are no two power centers, then what is wrong with it? digvijay singh− ye to ab party main dibet hogi tab puuchhenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - All the veteran leaders of the party have said off the record that there should not be two power centers in the party
 digvijay singh− agar aapane yah baat kahi he to hamaari party ke jitne varisht netaa hai unhonen kaha hoga
 Manoranjan Bharti- Should one person hold the post of PM and party in 2014? digvijay singh− ye to bada hipothetical prashn he kyonki 2014 main bahumat hamen milegaa
 Our government will be formed
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar banegi
 It is not clear which parties will be our allies
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par 2014 main hi ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh
 aap mulaayam singh par kis had tak bharosa kar sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to rata-rataa speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza

 Digvijay Singh - is going on
 manoranjan bharti− yadi raajnneeti vigyaan kaa koi chaatr do power centre naa hone kii baat kahe to isamen galat kya he? Digvijay Singh - He will be debated in the party now, then he will ask
 manoranjan bharti− party ke sabhi diggaj netaaon ne of da record kaha he ki party main do power centre nahin hone chahie
 Digvijay Singh- If you have said this, then all the senior leaders of our party are said
 manoranjan bharti− kya 2014 main piem pad or party kii satta ek vyakti ke haath main honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh- This is a big hypothetical question because we will get majority in 2014
 hamaari sarkaar banegi
 a coalition government will be formed
 koun si partiyaan hamaari sahyogi hogi, ye abhi spasht nahin he
 Depending on the circumstances, the strategy will be decided in 2014 itself
 manoranjan bharti− kya chunaav samay se pehle ho sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - i do not think the election will be premature
 manoranjan bharti− uttar pradesh ko aap deal karte hai
 To what extent can you trust Mulayam Singh? digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
 kya aap maanate hai is theuri ko? Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharati - You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 manoranjan bharti− yadi raajnneeti vigyaan kaa koi chaatr do power centre naa hone kii baat kahe to isamen galat kya he? Digvijay Singh - He will be debated in the party now, then he will ask
 manoranjan bharti− party ke sabhi diggaj netaaon ne of da record kaha he ki party main do power centre nahin hone chahie
 Digvijay Singh- If you have said this, then all the senior leaders of our party are said
 manoranjan bharti− kya 2014 main piem pad or party kii satta ek vyakti ke haath main honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh- This is a big hypothetical question because we will get majority in 2014
 hamaari sarkaar banegi
 a coalition government will be formed
 koun si partiyaan hamaari sahyogi hogi, ye abhi spasht nahin he

 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharati - You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 digvijay singh− ye to ab party main dibet hogi tab puuchhenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - All the veteran leaders of the party have said off the record that there should not be two power centers in the party
 digvijay singh− agar aapane yah baat kahi he to hamaari party ke jitne varisht netaa hai unhonen kaha hoga
 Manoranjan Bharti- Should one person hold the post of PM and party in 2014? digvijay singh− ye to bada hipothetical prashn he kyonki 2014 main bahumat hamen milegaa
 Our government will be formed
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar banegi
 It is not clear which parties will be our allies
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par 2014 main hi ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh
 aap mulaayam singh par kis had tak bharosa kar sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to rata-rataa speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that spoiled the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Manoranjan Bharati - All the veteran leaders of the party have said off the record that there should not be two power centers in the party
 digvijay singh− agar aapane yah baat kahi he to hamaari party ke jitne varisht netaa hai unhonen kaha hoga

 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh- If you have said this, then all the senior leaders of our party are said
 manoranjan bharti− kya 2014 main piem pad or party kii satta ek vyakti ke haath main honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh- This is a big hypothetical question because we will get majority in 2014
 hamaari sarkaar banegi
 a coalition government will be formed
 koun si partiyaan hamaari sahyogi hogi, ye abhi spasht nahin he
 Depending on the circumstances, the strategy will be decided in 2014 itself
 manoranjan bharti− kya chunaav samay se pehle ho sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - i do not think the election will be premature
 manoranjan bharti− uttar pradesh ko aap deal karte hai
 To what extent can you trust Mulayam Singh? digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
 kya aap maanate hai is theuri ko? Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharati - You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 manoranjan bharti− kya 2014 main piem pad or party kii satta ek vyakti ke haath main honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh- This is a big hypothetical question because we will get majority in 2014
 hamaari sarkaar banegi
 a coalition government will be formed
 koun si partiyaan hamaari sahyogi hogi, ye abhi spasht nahin he
 Depending on the circumstances, the strategy will be decided in 2014 itself
 manoranjan bharti− kya chunaav samay se pehle ho sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - i do not think the election will be premature
 manoranjan bharti− uttar pradesh ko aap deal karte hai
 To what extent can you trust Mulayam Singh? digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
 kya aap maanate hai is theuri ko? Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female

 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 digvijay singh− ye to bada hipothetical prashn he kyonki 2014 main bahumat hamen milegaa
 Our government will be formed
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar banegi
 It is not clear which parties will be our allies
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par 2014 main hi ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh
 aap mulaayam singh par kis had tak bharosa kar sakate hai? Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to rata-rataa speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that spoiled the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Manoranjan Bharati- Can elections be held ahead of time? digvijay singh− mujhe nahin lagata he ki chunaav samay se pehle hoga
 You deal with Manoranjan Bharati - Uttar Pradesh

 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate

 How can we give employment to people through the development of the cycle, which is a big achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we gave right to education, gave right to education, gave right to work, now We have given the right to foot

 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that spoiled the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh - i do not think the election will be premature
 manoranjan bharti− uttar pradesh ko aap deal karte hai
 To what extent can you trust Mulayam Singh? digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
 kya aap maanate hai is theuri ko? Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharati - You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 manoranjan bharti− uttar pradesh ko aap deal karte hai
 To what extent can you trust Mulayam Singh? digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
