 The Uttarakhand government has also left this visit to God
 sarkaar ne kudarat se ladane main khud ko asamarth bataate hue mangalvaar ko saaf kiya ki yadi mausam yun hi kharaab rahaa to sarkaar bhi kuch nahin kar sakati
 Currently, the Char Dham Yatra has been stopped after thousands of people have been stranded on the way to Badrinath after the Kanchenjunga glacier collapsed

 But everyone is upset due to the lack of mobile network in the rural areas of agar-malwa

 vahiin gruhaniyon kaa bhi kahana he ki network nahin hone kii vajah se unhen bahut pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 They say that when there is no way to talk to the relatives living on mobile then transferring money through mobile is very far away
 mobile network sarvice prowider companiyon ke dilers se is sambandh main baat kii gai to unka kahana tha ki cashles india kii muhim ko safal bananaa he to jaruri he ki log mobile banking se paise kaa lenden kar saken
 Mobile SIM dealer Neeraj Jain said that without the presence of a network with strong signal, the dream of Cashless India cannot be turned into reality

 There are preparations to deploy these tanks on the Pakistan border in Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir
 tii-90 tanks kaa istemaal yuddh ke liye pramukhataa se kiya jaataa he
 There is a saying about Patna Sahib seat
 kehete hai patna sahib se bijepi, nalanda se jediu or kishanganj se congress kisi ko bhi tikat de de to uski chunaavon main jeet pakki he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad is a veteran leader anyway but the battle for him is not so easy
 unka muqabla apane hi sajaateey pratyaashee shatrughna sinha se he
 From a candidate who has been an MP from Patna Sahib twice in a row
 ravishankar prasad patna sahib kii sadakon par utarkar logon se mil rahe hai
 There is a surge of supporters behind
 peeche narebaaji chal rahi he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad's enthusiasm with slogans is also increasing
 is bich ajtak ne ravishankar prasad se unke chunavi kshetra patna sahib main alag alag muddon par baat kii
 Prasad told Aaj Tak's executive editor Anjana Om Kashyap, 'I will not take the name of Shatrughan Sinha
 ye muddon kii ladaai he-aashaa banaam avasarwaad
 Now he went to the new party, 22 years was in our party
 ham logon ne unhen jitaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii
 Been there, let it go
 jis party main gaye hai, unase jarur sawaal puuchhenge ki rahul gandhi aaj shaheedon kaa apmaan karte hai, saboot maangate hai
 The point of this election is whether the martyrs need proof or Hindustan needs a true son
 'ravishankar prasad ke liye patna sahib kii jang naak kii ladaai ban gai he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad and BJP have given full strength in the election campaign
 ravishankar prasad apane liye nahin, balki modi ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, he said, 'I have been roaming the area for one and a half months
 sab meraa samarthan karne baahar nikle hai
 See their enthusiasm, everybody wants to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister again
 aaj mujhe garv he ki narendra modi ji ne bharat ko us oonchai par pahunchaaya he
 For the poor, for the soldiers and for the honor of India has increased
 is chunaav kaa mudda he ki hindustan ko koun aage badhayega or hindustan kaa koun maan-sammaan rakhega
 In Patna Sahib, Ravi Shankar Prasad is trying hard to win, on the other hand, Shatrughan Sinha is also frozen in the electoral arena with full force
 shatrughna sinha bijepi ke tikat par patna sahib se do baar saansad bane lekin is baar to shatrughna sinha kii raajnneetik duniya hi badal gai
 Shatrughan started his political innings against the Congress but is now contesting from Patna Sahib on a Congress ticket
 pichley kuch saal se shatrughna sinha ke tevar sarkaar ke virodh main chal rahe the, lihaaja bijepi ne unhen party se to nahin nikaala lekin unka tikat jarur kaat diya
 RJD and Congress started circling for the enemy ticket
 unki jid thi ki sichuation bhale hi kuch ho lekin lokation nahin badalegi
 That means if you fight with Patna Sahib
 shatrughna sinha aakhirkaar patna sahib seat se congress kaa tikat paa hi gaye
 So the BJP fielded Ravi Shankar Prasad against him
 do-do diggajon kii ladaai main bihar kii viipi seat rahi patna sahib seat ab or bhi surkhiyon main chaa gai he
 The battle of Patna Sahib has become interesting in the fight of two Kayastha leaders
 patna sahib seat par 28 pratishat savarna voter hai, jinamein zyaadaatar kysth hai
 Kayastha votes have been decisive in Patna Sahib seat
 patna sahib kii 6 main se 5 vidhansabha siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 In response to a question from Aaj Tak, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, 'BJP will have a historic victory
 hamen is baat kaa santosh he ki narendra modi kii aguai main bharat ko eemaandaar banane kii koshish kii he or ise ve aage badhayenge
 On a question about Shatrughan Sinha, he said in Bhojpuri that 'we are hero Nayakhi, an ordinary worker of Patna
 ham janata ke bich rahile aur hamaraa ke uhe rahe deen
 Now formed the hero of Hamra
 jo hero baadan unka rahe deen (main hero nahin hum, patna kaa ek saadhaaran kaaryakarta hum
 i live in public and let us be so
 ab mujhe hero banane kii jarurat nahin he, jo hero he use rahane den)
 Ravi Shankar Prasad further said that if it is counted on the 23rd, there will be a historic victory
 sirf bhaajapa ko akele purna bahumat milane ja rahaa he
 The common citizen of India believes that the country is safe in the hands of Modi ji
 abhi haal main pradhanmantri modi ne rajeev gandhi ko 'bhrashtachari number 1' bataaya
 On a question related to this, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, 'what is Rahul Gandhi not saying to Prime Minister Modi
 ek baar boforce kii kahani khul gai to ve pareshaan ho gaye
 Who was maternal uncle? If it comes out, it will go away, the history of Congress is well known in the case of corruption
 patna ke saansad jis party main gaye hai, unhen jawaab dena padegaa
 Proud that there has not been a single corruption led by Narendra Modi
 wo 17-18 ghante khatate (parishram) hai or humlog bhi khatate hai, is tarah desh ko aage badhanaa he
 In 2014, BJP got 48 percent upper caste votes, RJD got 23 percent and JDU got 6 percent upper caste votes
 siyasat ke diggajon kaa maananaa he ki kysth vot bank bijepi ke bhi patibaddh voter rahe hai, lihaaja kysth voton main bade paimaane par bantwaaraa nahin ho saktaa
 Shatrughan Sinha may get Muslim votes along with other castes
 baharhaal donon pratyaashiyon ne patna sahib main puraa jor laga rakhaa he
 On 8 May, Shatrughan Sinha did a road show in Patna, while Ravi Shankar Prasad did a road show with a team force in Patna on 26 April
 ravishankar prasad yun to apane virodhiyon kii dhajjiyaan udaane main koi kor kasar nahin rakhte lekin chunavi raajnneeti ke aagaaj ke saath unki ek duvidha bhi shuru ho gai
 Actually he has Shatrughan Sinha in front of him, who is his old friend
 ravishankar prasad unke khilaaf kuch bhi kehane se bachate hai
 This confusion of Ravi Shankar Prasad is not one sided
 shatrughna sinha bhi jahaan modi sarkaar par jamkar barasate hai, vahiin ravishankar prasad par sidhe sidhe koi waar karne se bachate hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad is a product of the JP movement
 vishvavidhyalay kii raajnneeti se desh kii raajnneeti main pahunche hai
 Has been in bjp's national executive since 1995
 unki ahmiyat isi baat se jaani ja sakati he ki wo atal sarkaar main mantri rahe to modi sarkaar main bhi kanoon mantri hai
 He may be fighting elections for the first time but specializes in politics
 wo jaanate hai ki unki pehali raajnneetik ladaai aasaan nahin he
 Shatrughan Sinha is also an actor along with the leader, twice has been an MP of Patna Sahib
 donon diggaj apni jeet ke liye pasinaa baha rahe hai, diggajon kii jang dilachasp mode par pahunch chuki he
 Patna Sahib seat will be voted in the last phase on May 19 and the results will be on May 23

 jitiya vrath ke bare main aasthaa he ki ise karne se bhagwaan jiutvahan, putr par aane vaali sabhi samasyaon se uski raksha karaten hai
 This fast is observed by married women
 manyata he ki ise karne se putr prapti bhi hoti he
 There was a city named Kanchanabati near the Kathanarmada river of Jitiya fast
 vahaan kaa raja malyketu tha
 To the west of the river Narmada was the desert, which was called Baluhata
 vahaan vishaal pakad kaa ped tha
 The eagle lived on it
 ped ke neeche khodhar tha, jisamen siaarin rahati thi
 Both Chil and Sarin were friends
 ek baar donon ne milakar jitiya vrath karne kaa sankalp liya
 Then both of them performed Nirjalavratrakha to worship Lord Jeevaatavahan
 vrath vaale din us nagar ke bade vyapaaree kii mrityu ho gayi
 Now he was cremated at the same desert
 kaali raat hui or ghanghor gata barasane lagi
 Sometimes lightning strikes, sometimes clouds thunder
 toofaan aa gaya tha
 Siyarin was now hungry
 murda dekhakar vah khud ko roak na saki or uskaa vrath tut gaya
 But the eagle kept sobriety and passed the fast on the next day with the rule of faith, then in the next birth both the women were born as daughters in the Brahmin family
 unke pita kaa naam bhaskar tha
 Chil became the elder sister and was named Shilwati
 shilvati kishadibuddhisen ke saath hui
 Siyaran was born as a younger sister and was named Kapuravati
 uski shaadi us nagar ke raja malayaketu se hui
 Now Kapuravati became the queen of Kanchanabati Nagar
 bhagwaan jiutvahan ke aashirwad se shilvati ke saat bete hue
 But all the children of Kapuravati died as soon as they were born
 kuch samay baad shilvati ke saaton putr bade ho gaye
 They all started working in the king's court
 kapuravati ke man main unhen dekh irshyaa kii bhaavana aa gayi
 He told the king and cut off the heads of all the sons
 unhen saat nae bartan mangvakar usamen rakh diya or laal kapade se dhakkar shilvati ke paas bhijwa diya
 Seeing this, Bhagwan Ji Joutvahana made the heads of the seven brothers from the soil and sprinkled nectar on everyone's head by attaching it to his torso
 isse unamem jaan aa gai
 The seven men became alive and returned home
 jo kate sar rani ne bheje the ve fal ban gaye
 Rani Kapuravati, on the other hand, was anxious to get information from Budhisen's house
 jab kaaphi der soochna nahin ai to kapuravati swayan badi bahan ke ghar gayi
 She was shocked to see everyone alive there
 jab use hosh aayaa to bahan ko usne sari baat bataai
 Now he was regretting his mistake
 bhagwaan jiutvahan kii krupa se shilvati ko purv janm kii baaten yaad aa gayi
 She went to the same Pakad tree with Kapuravati and told him all the things
 kapuravati behosh ho gai or mar gai
 When the king got the news of this, he went to the same place and cremated Kapuravati under the Pakad tree

 aane vaali film'jajba'se bollywood main kambek kar raheen actress aishwarya raay bachchan ab bahut hi kade dialog bolti hui najar aaengi

 aparaadhiyon se do-do haath karti police officer bani priyanka chopra kii film 'jai gangaajal' behad charchaa main he
 The trailer of the film is getting a lot of praise, but before the release of the film, the censor board scissors are ready to cut it big
 hameshaa raajnneetik or saamaajik muddon par film banane vaale 'jai gangaajal' ke nirdeshak prakaash jha sensor board ke faisle ke khilaaf court jane kaa man bana rahe hai
 As soon as the Shyam Benegal Committee was set up, a filmmaker has once again raised his voice against the censor board
 bihar kii raajnneeti, police-prashasan or vahaan ke samaajik taane-bane ko bayaan karti jha kii 'jai gangaajal' kahani bihar kii prishthbhumi par gadhi he or isliye yahaan kii boli, yahaan kaa andaaj or jumale, film main istemaal hue hai
 But, even before the release of the film, the Censor Board has suggested several cuts to the film
 tippaniyan The censor board wants parts of the film's sound track and scenes in which verbal and physical violence is shown
 media ko bayaan jari kar nirdeshak prakaash jha ne sensor board ke khilaaf naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Jha says that two members of the censor board want to give an 'A' certificate to my film
 main 'e' certificate nahin le saktaa
 The board's revising committee saw the film and with 11 cuts they agreed to give me a 'UA' certificate
 ection seen ko 50 pratishat kaatane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Even the scene is fine, but this kind of manipulation of the language used in the film is wrong for my film

 jab jha kii film 'gangaajal' bani thi, tab bhi bijepi kii hi sarkaar thi or ravishankar prasad soochna evam prasaaran mantri the
 In his statement, Jha said that the government had appreciated the film without major changes then
 lekin, 'jai gangaajal' par is tarah kanchi chalaanaa sirf ek vyaktigat soch dikhti he yani pehlaaj nihlani phir ek baar bollywood ke nishane par hai
 Jha's 'jai Gangajal' story, describing Bihar's politics, police-administration and its social fabric, is set on the backdrop of Bihar and hence the dialect, style and jumle here are used in the film
 lekin, film ke relies hone se pehle hi sensor board ne film ko kai kats sujhaaye hai
 The comments sensor board chahta he ki film ke sound trek or drishyon ke un hisson ko hataaya jaae, jinamein maukhik or shaareerik hinsa dikhaai gai he
 By issuing a statement to the media, director Prakash Jha has expressed his displeasure against the censor board

 The film 'junoon', based on the 1947 revolution, was screened at the 16th Mumbai Film Festival in Mumbai
 film main sarfaraaj ke ahm kirdaar ko nibhaane vaale nasiruddin shah ne nijee zindagi kii kuch baaten share kii
 He gave 2 reasons for doing this film
 pehali yah ki naseer saab videshi mul ke actor 'geoffrey candal' ke kaaphi bade prashansak the, jinke saath unhen mushkil se 2 minute kaa seen karnaa tha
 The second reason stated that he did not have to share the same room with actor Kulbhushan Kharbanda luckily, due to which Naseeruddin Shah got rid of Kulbhushan's snoring
 nasiruddin shah ne bataaya kii wo 'junun' film ke dauraan bilkul apane bete vivaan jaise the, jaisaa wo happy new year main dikhte hai
 Naseeruddin Shah said that he does not watch Hindi commercial films, and anyone else watches cinema
 nasiruddin shah ne bataaya ki hamaare desh main chillane or rone ko hi 'acting' kaha jaataa he jo ki galat he
 Significantly, 'junoon' is produced by Shashi Kapoor and director Shyam Benegal
 yah film mashhoor lekhak 'ruskin bond' kii short stories par aadhaarit he
 Figures are not dishonest in themselves, but they do not have enough strength to stop their arbitrary use
 bihar chunaav se thik pehle aae janaganana-2011 ke aankadon kaa dharmik khand kai maamle main isi traasadee se guzar rahaa he
 These figures are mainly presented as if the Hindu population is decreasing and the Muslim population is increasing
 dekhne kaa ek najariya yah to ise dekhne ko or bhi bahut se sateek tareeke ho sakate hai
 For example, if it is said that between 2001 and 2011, the population of Hindus increased four times compared to Muslims, then this would be a matter of fact
 is dashak main musalamaanon kii sankhya main 3
 4 crores and 13 in number of Hindus
 8 karod kaa ijapha hua
 It is clear from this that four times the number of Muslims in India is associated with Hindus in this decade
 prachlit mimasa main doosraa tathy yah aa rahaa he ki muslim aabaadi ke badhane kii raftaar hindu aabaadi badhane kii raftaar se tej he
 So in this we should also think according to our national population policy
 iske hisaab se ham aabaadi ko niyantrit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The special thing is that people of both the communities took initiative in this direction and the growth rate of population in both religions has decreased from the growth rate of the last decade
 yani tamaam bhrantiyon ke baavjood itnaa to tay he ki musalmaan bhi pehle se kam raftaar se aabaadi badhaane ke falsafe se sahamat hai
 Here, who can take a view of the social condition of the Muslims, may also ask why the Muslims are not putting a brake on the population at the same speed as the Hindus
 to unhen sachhar cameti kii report se bhi mukhaatib bane rahanaa chahie
 According to this, in many cases the condition of the Muslims of India has gone through the economic social condition of the Dalits
 sarkari naukariyon main unki hissedari bhi aabaadi ke anupaat main kam he
 It is also recognized that there is a direct relation between population control and economic social level of rise
 bharat main ashikshit or garib samaaj madhyamvargeey pariwaron kii tulana main aaj bhi jansankhya ke bare main alag dharna rakhata he
 It is possible that when the government releases the caste-based census data in the future, it will be known what trends are there in the population among the deprived and the affluent castes
 aankadon ke abhaav main rosemara ke anubhav se to yahi dikhataa he ki garib parivaar aaj bhi us dharna se puri tarah cat nahin paae ki jitne haath honge utani kamai
 While the middle class thinks that the fewer children there are, the better parenting
 haalanki yah varg bhi bete-beti ke fark ke pher main ghira he
 It is necessary, however, to think that inanimate figures are not presented as an unnecessary challenge to the living mankind
 aankadon ko tanj yaa hikaarat kii tarah oochhaalane se behatar he ki yah sochaa jaae ki pichde logon ko tarakkee kii raah main baraabar kaa bhagidaar kaise banaaya jaae
 On the day that the growth figures will start coming from one for all religions, it may be that on that day the figures of population growth should also go beyond the restrictions of caste and religion

 a glimpse of this was seen on Friday when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in his party meeting, without naming Giriraj Singh, said that those who are engaged in scrapping the coalition will get an answer after the assembly elections and also said that Some people make a statement against me and when they meet, they say that they do so for a splash
 is par giriraaj ne twit kar turant apana jawaab diya
 He tweeted, 'by the kindness of Mahadev, which i think is right, i do not speak in front of anyone nor do i speak back and remain firm on what i say

 Then Tejashwi Yadav asked why he was made Deputy Chief Minister then
 tejasvi ne shanivaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar apane vikaas par itnaa bharosa he to akele chunaav kyon nahin lard lete
 Then Tejashwi, in favor of Giriraj Singh, asked Nitish Kumar that if the people who are warning him to take action after the election, why not take action before the election? Why did the angry Nitish Kumar say to the media- Whatever is in your mind, do not print or print, i have no need for publicity

 BJP netaaon ke bayaan se dukhi nitish ne kaha- gathbandhan main 'khachapach' karne vaala vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bure haal main hogaalekin bhaajapa ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki jis prakaar se giriraaj or tejasvi ek duusare se bayano main sur taal mila rahe hai usase raajnneetik laabh akhirkaar nitish kumaar ko hi hoga
 If Yadav and Bhumihar caste leaders are kept together or on different targets by Nitish Kumar, then the traditional voters of Nitish are especially non-yadav, backward, extremely backward and Mahadalit and more mobilized, which was seen in 2010

 mujhe vishwaas he ki hamaari team se koi na koi yah acchhee gend phenkega
 When someone asked if this match could be considered Kohli vs Malinga, the Sri Lankan captain did not give it much importance

 The final is a big match and the tension is completely different
 match ke din jo acha khelegaa, vah jeet saktaa he
 Malinga said, i never get down to any match with the intention of proving myself
 meri team main anya khilaadi bhi hai, jo team ke liye kaam ko anjaam de sakate hai

 Lahiru got the chance and proved how good a player he is

 We have to see the pitch and then decide what combination we want

 The opposition in the Rajya Sabha is not strong on the demand of the Select Committee and the Opposition is firm on its stand that the bill which the government wants to pass has all the flaws and it is desperately needed to be sent to the Select Committee

 Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Aggarwal's statement on Kulbhushan Yadav is being condemned all-round
 naresh agarwal se jab buudhvaar ko jadhav se mulaakaat ke samay unki maa or unki patni ke saath hue bartaav ko lekar poocha gaya to naresh agarwal ne kaha ki, jab pakistan unhen aatankwaadi maanata he to unke saath vaisaa hi vyavhaar karegaa
 He also said that India should deal with terrorists in the same strict manner
 is bayaan ko lekar jab bavaal machana shuru hua tonaresh agarwalane safai di ki unke kehane kaa matlab yah nahin tha

 National Wildlife Board member and author Prerna Singh Bindra says this will have an adverse effect on tiger conservation as 40 per cent of tigers are not confined to sanctuaries

 Abhilash Bhaskar explains, "in July 2012, when the Supreme Court imposed a complete ban on such tourism to protect tigers, conservationists argued against it that it would increase the smuggling of wildlife because then the hunters open up fearlessly
 They will be able to see that no one is watching them

 inamen dhamkee di gai he ki tii24 lautaa to pradarshan kiye jaaenge
 The big question is why the Rajasthan government took the decision to move the T-24 in such a hurry and why not take the path to negotiate with the Central Zoo Authority and the NTCA? To understand this, we have to examine all the factions active in Ranthambore

 The lobby has close ties not only to Thapar but also to many local and other important wildlife experts and voluntary organizations, many of whom have interests in the hotel business and rotate tourists for a fee as expert guides

 yahaan dekhen bhartee kaa notification In 2015, the picture of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani and 10 of his associates in Kashmir, which not only went viral but also appeared in many magazines and newspapers in the country, has now become a history
 is tasviir main burhan brigade kaa aakhri aatanki wasim ahamed shah shanivaar ko pulavama jile ke bheetar gaanvon main may suraksha balon ke saath ek muthbhed main maaraa gaya
 All 10 terrorists seen in the photo were killed in Kashmir and the 11th terrorist Tariq Pandit is serving a sentence in prison after surrendering
 2015 main maaraa gaya tha burhantasvir main burhan vaani ke saath jo baaki 10 aatanki he unamem se 2015 main hi burhan vaani ke saath-saath 7 aatanki maare gaye the jabaki jabaki burhan vaani ke uttaradhikari sabjar bhat or ek anya ko 2016 main maaraa gaya or maatr ek bache aatanki wasim shah ko shanivaar ko maar giraaya gaya
 However, after the killing of Wasim Shah Burhan Wani, Hizbul left the Mujahideen and joined the lashkar-e-taiba and was the Lashkar commander of Shopian district
 kai kashmiri yuvaaon ne pakadi aatank kii raah2015 main yah tasviir viral hone ke saath-saath kashmir main aatankwaadiyon ke liye prachaar kaa ek saadhan bhi ban gayi thi or mana ja rahaa he ki is tasviir ke soshal media par viral ho jane ke baad kai kashmiri yuva aatankwaad kii raah pakad kar aatanki samooh main shaamil ho gaye
 Somewhere it is also a reality because before this, terrorists active in Kashmir did not present their pictures in this way
 yah kashmir main chal rahe kareeb teen dashakon ke aatankwaad main pehla mauka tha jab ek saath 11 aatanki vah bhi khoobasarat or hathiyaarband tareeke se tasveeron main nazar aae the
 After that, the local terrorists in Kashmir made social media their weapon and gave direction to terrorism with them and kept connecting with them among their supporters
 burhan bigrade kaa khatmakashmir main suraksha balon ke liye is tasviir main dikh rahe aatankiyon kaa khaatmaa naak kaa sawaal ban gaya tha or aakhirkaar 14 oktober 2017 ko sena or suraksha balon ne kaante kii tarah chubh rahi us tasviir ko itihaas bana hi diya
 But now the question arises whether the elimination of Burhan Brigade has brought an end to terrorism in Kashmir but it probably will not happen because 130 local youths have become militants in the valley after Burhan Wani was killed and many of them are killed everyday
 They are also going and new local terrorists are also being formed every day
 kashmir main sena or suraksha balon kii taraf se oparation ol out chal rahaa he lekin jaankaron kaa yahi maananaa he ki aatankwaad ko khatm karne ke liye aatankwaadiyon ko maarane se zaruri un samasyaon par kaabo paanaa he, jo aatankwaad ko paidaa karte hai

 Against Korea, India lost despite a 2–0 lead due to the defense's weakness

 The Congress created a lot of uproar over the Parliament session starting on Friday
 saath hi kaha tha ki sarkaar ne gujarat chunaav ko dekhte hue sheetakaaleen satr ko samay par nahin bulaayaa
 The Congress also alleged that the government wanted to avoid issues related to corruption

 The first two phases of the Lok Sabha elections saw polling in 16 seats in Uttar Pradesh, out of which the Samajwadi Party (SP) had fielded candidates in only three seats, but in the third phase on April 23, 10 seats will be voted out of which nine seats are SP
 The candidates are in the fray

 Two days ago, in Mainpuri, Mulayam Singh Yadav shared the stage with BSP supremo Mayawati while burying his two and a half decade old enmity
 mainpuri ke parinaam ko lekar koi anumaan nahin he kyonki mulaayam singh yadav yahaan sabase kaddavar or lokapriy netaa hai
 He was elected from both Mainpuri and Azamgarh in 2014, but later chose Azamgarh
 badaayun main sapa ke ummidavaar dharmedra yadav hai jinako congress pratyaashee saleem ikbaal sherwani se sidhi takkar mil rahi he

 In Rampur, there is a contest between BJP candidate Jayaprada and sp's Azam Khan
 pilibhit main bhaajapa saansad varun gandhi ko sapa ke hemraj verma chunauti de rahe hai to moradabad main bhaajapa pratyaashee sarvesh singh ko yuva kavi imran pratagadhi chunauti de rahe hai
 The BJP is looking at its strong position in both these parliamentary constituencies

 pdf Actor Dilip Kumar, considered the favorite actor of his time, has been an ICU Admittee for the last four days
 dihydration or urinary infections kii samasya ke chalate buudhvaar dopaher ko unhen mumbai ke leelavati aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya tha, jiske baad se unhen isiu main rakhaa gaya he
 If sources are to be believed, there is no improvement in Dilip Saheb's health at the moment but surprisingly it is that not a single Bollywood star has arrived to know the status of this Bollywood legend
 guuruuvaar kodilip kumaaraki kidney me infections kii khabare ain lekin abhi tak unki tabiyat main koi sudhaar nahi hai
 Despite being admitted in the Bandra area of mumbai for the last four days, no Bollywood actor has visited Lilavati Hospital to meet him till now
 jis aspataal main dilip kumaar admit hai vahaan se lagbhag 5 se 10 minute kii duri par bollywood ke kai stars rahete hai jiname shahrukh khan, salmaan khan, sanjay dutt, rekha, jaiki shroff, nasiruddin shah sahit tamaam baden kalakaaron ke naam shaamil he
 However, one reason for this is that the arrival of VVIP guests increases the responsibility of hospital administration
 isi ke chalate aspataal prashasan nedilip sahab ke parivaaravaalon se apil kii he ki kam se kam log hi unase milane aaen taaki aspataal ke anya marijon ko kisi bhi tarah kii pareshaani naa ho
 The second reason is that Dilip Saheb is in ICU, so it is not appropriate to meet him properly and perhaps that is why no artist from b Town has reached Lilavati Hospital till now to meet Dilip Sahab
 philhaladilip sahabake phans unke jald se jald thik hone kii kaamana kar rahe hai
 Politics is raging in Kerala over the cow slaughter of Congress party workers and the Beef Party case

 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav najadik aate hi basapa pramukh mayawati ne virodhiyon par hamale tej kar die hai
 Former Chief Minister Mayawati held a press conference on Monday, targeting PM Modi and SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 mayawati ne yahaan tak kah diya ki upi main samaajawaadee party or congress ke bich gathbandhan kaa bhavishya bijepi par nirbhar he
 Mayawati has been out of power since 2012
 november main piem modi ne jab notebandi kaa elaan kiya to kaha gaya ki centre sarkaar ke is kadam kaa upi chunaavon main use phayda hoga
 It was claimed that the money game will no longer run in the elections, in such a situation the winning parties will have to suffer the loss of demonetisation due to money power
 bispi hi nahin, soobe kii sattarudh samaajawaadee party or congress ne bhi notebandi ke faisle ko lekar modi sarkaar par hamalaa bol diya
 BJP says that there is uneasiness within these three parties due to demonetisation
 in partiyon ke log kamishan par note badalane main lage hue hai or notebandi ko lekar janata ko gumraah karne kii sajeesh kar rahe hai
 The BJP believes that the demonetization decision is definitely causing trouble to the public but it is also expected that it is getting the support of the public and the saffron party will benefit from it in the elections
 ab mayawati kah rahi hai ki upi main sapa kagathabandhan bijepi ke dabaav menho rahaa he
 Mayawati said in the press conference, 'the final decision of the alliance of Congress and SP will be on bjp's profit, loss and behest
 ' mayawati ne kaha ki gathbandhan ke liye bijepi hari jhandi dikhaaegi or yah tabhi dikhaaegi jab use lagegaa ki gathbandhan se use chunaav main jarur phayda hoga
 The BSP supremo alleged that the PM Modi-led central government is pressurizing Mulayam Singh Yadav with the help of ED, Income Tax and CBI to tie up with the Congress
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat he ki mayawati mulaayam par jis tarah ke aarope ko lekar sanket de rahi hai, hakeekat iske ulat he
 Both Mayawati and Mulayam have been in the discussion regarding the matter of disproportionate assets
 taaja sthiti yah he ki aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main sapa mukhiya ko supreme court se raahat mili he jabaki sheersh adaalat aise hi maamle main mayawati ke khilaaf sunwaayee ko raji ho gaya he
 Not only this, the Income Tax Department has started an investigation against Mayawati's brother Anand Kumar in the benami property case
 aise halaat main piem modi or sapa mukhiya ko lekar mayawati kii baukhalaahat ko unki party kii aagaamee chunaavon main sambhaavnaaon ke maddenjar bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Opinion polls conducted so far for the assembly elections are showing Mayawati's party at number three
 mayawati ko shaayad is baat ko bhi lekar ashanka he ki agar sapa-congress kaa gathjod hua to unki satta main vaapasi kii ummiden kam ho jaaengi
 The BSP is preparing to stake a claim on Muslim voters in this election
 agar sapa or congress kaa gathbandhan hua to muslim vot bank main send lagaana basapa ke liye aasaan nahin hoga

 The Central Educational Institutions (reservation in teacher cadre) Bill 2019 has passed in the Lok Sabha on Monday
 iske mutabik kendriya shaikshik sansthaanon main department kii jagah vishvavidhyalay yaa college ko unit maanakar rigerveshan lagu kiya jayega
 After this, teachers will be appointed all over the country and reservation will be given
 elahabaad hoicourt ne 2017 main banaras hindu uniwarsity (biechayu) ko ek aadesh diya tha
 In which it was said that reservation should be calculated by considering the department as a unit and based on that, reservation should be given to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 jise 2018 main supreme court ne bhi hari jhandi de di thi
 But after the passing of this bill, now the university or college will be implemented as a unit instead of reservation department
 kendriya shaikshanik sanstha (shikshak ke coder main aarakshan) vidheyak 2019 saamaanya varg ke garib shikshakon ko bhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon main aarakshan kaa praavdhaan detaa he
 However, the ordinance that was implemented in March 2019 did not have a provision for reservation for them
 vidheyak ke donon sadan main paas hone ke baad raashtrapati ke paas anumodan ke liye jayega
 The government is claiming that after this the path of appointment of 7000 teachers will be cleared
 kya kahata he bilbil ke mutabik ab ek department ko unit maanane kii jagah kendriya shaikshik santhaan ko ek unit mana jayega
 Those institutions come in the form of Central Educational Institutions which are established and funded by the Central Government
 iskaa udhaaharan banaras hindu uniwarsity he
 The provision of the bill will not apply to research institutes, institutions of national and strategic importance
 bill kii aathvin anusuchee main yah bataaya gaya he ki aise 8 santhaan hai jin par yah lagu nahin hoga
 The government has stated that 717 for 2019-20 and 2020-21 for the recruitment of vacant posts in central educational institutions
 83 karod aavantit ho chukaa he
 Representation will be reduced as the department considers the unit, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe teachers have been constantly urging that they have less representation in higher educational institutions
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne 2017-18 main ol india survey for hair ajukeshan (AISE) karaayaa tha
 According to this the total number of teachers was 12,84,755
 jisamen saamaanya varg ke shikshak 56
 8 per cent
 jabaki anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati kaa pratinidhitiv kramash: 8
 6 percent and 2
 27 fisadi tha
 While the obcs represent 32
 3 fisadi tha
 It was revealed in the survey that in giving reservation to the department as a unit, the representation of the reserved classes will be reduced, while the university or college will be considered as a unit
 vartmaan main anusuchit jati ke liye 15 fisadi, anusuchit janajati ke liye 7
 There is a provision of 5 per cent and 27 per cent reservation for obcs
 aise main agar kisi department main 1 pad khaali he to uski bhartee main aarakshan lagu nahin ho paata he, kyonki ise 100 fisadi mana jayega
 For example, if there are 6 vacancies in a department and if a scheduled caste is recruited, then it is 16
 6 fisadi aarakshan ho jayega
 In such a situation, there should be at least 7 posts for the recruitment of a scheduled caste
 usee tarah anusuchit janajati ke ek pad ko bharne ke liye kam se kam 14 pad hone chahie kyonki unka aarakshan 7
 5 percent and at least 4 posts should be vacant for recruitment to one post of OBC
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saansad varun gandhi ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki naukariyon main anusujit jati evam janajati ke lieaarakshankhatm kar diya janaa chahie kyonki yah aam janata ke hiton ke viruddh he evam yogya ummidavaaron ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan he
 Varun Gandhi said in a program at the Hindu College in Moradabad, 'I am the only MP who raised voice against reservation
 ’ unhone kaha ki kaarykushalta ke str par khaskar swasthya kshetra kii naukariyon main koi samjhauta nahin hona chahie
 Commenting on the functioning of the young mps, he said that most of them ignored their constituencies while public representatives in developed countries make every effort to keep in touch with voters
 pilibhit ke saansad ne kaha ki apane nirvachan kshetra ko adhikadhik samay dena unki sheersh praathamikta he taaki logon kii shikayaton kaa nivaaran ho

 ’(input agency se) Maithilisharanandakishore Navalrajkamal Publication, Price: 650 Rs
 labboluab: gupt ji kii sabase sundar gyaarah kritiyon par naval likhit vishleshnatmak aalekh padhane ke baad swatah hi sabit ho jaataa he ki ve khadi boli hindi ke bade kavi hai
 But the socialism and ideology inherent in his poems are not deeply explored
 ek aise daur main jab samay-samay par likhe gaye samikshatmak nibandhon ko sangrahit kar aalochana pustak taiyaar karne kaa chalan joro par he, nandakishor naval hindi ke un gine-chune aalochakon main hai jo aaj bhi aalochana karm ke prati apni gambhirtha or nishtha ko barkaraar rakhe hue hai
 This book is called Maithilisharan
 isamen unhone maithilisharan gupt ke kavy ko centre main rakhkar apana vishad or vyavasthit adhyayan prastut kiya he
 He has presented similar systematic studies on Muktibodh and Nirala
 is kitaab main naval ne yathasambhav gupt ji ke sampurna kavy kaa vivechan-vishleshan kiya he
 He has also discussed small poetic books of the Gupta in terms of poetic beauty in a big article
 lekin kitaab kaa mukhya aakarshan ve gyaarah lekh hai, jinke antargat gupt kii sabase sundar gyaarah kritiyon kramshah jaydrath vadh, panchvati, saket, jai bharat, yashodhara, vishnupriya, dwapar, siddhraj, bharat-bharti, swadesh-sangeet or jhkaar kaa vyapak adhyayan-vishleshan kiya gaya he
 After reading this, the reader proves to be an important poet of Hindi, standing on the basis of his great poetic sensation and creative experiments in the eyes of the reader
 aalochak ko is sandarbh main alag se kuch kehane kii jarurat hi nahin rah jaati
 Maithilisharan Gupta is by far the most popular poets in modern times
 jahaan tak hindi pathak kaa sawaal he, usne aarambh se hi unako apane jaateey kavi ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 There was never any doubt in the mind of the Hindi reader about his greatness
 andeh kaa bijaropan to un aalochakon ne kiya jinhone 'aitihaasik mahatta banaam saahitiyik mahatta' or 'lokapriyata banaam shreshthata'' kaa nirarthak vibhaajan paidaa karke gupt ji aitihaasik mahatv vaala or lokapriy kavi kii shrenee main daalkar unka ghor avamulyan kiya
 Naval strongly opposes such divisions in this book and the consequent treatment of him in Hindi criticism
 ve kehete hai, ''yah asambhav he ki koi kavi saahitiyik drushti se mahatvapurn na ho or vah itihaas main amarta kaa adhikari ho
 Secondly, it is also impossible for a poet to turn the stream of poetry by giving speeches or writing articles
 
 
 yah baar-baar kehane kii aavashyaktaa he ki gupt ne apni aparimit srijan-kshamta se khadi boli main kavy rachana kaa maarg prashast kiya or use nae-nae aayam pradaan kiye
 "naval has shown it reliably that even in terms of poetic beauty, his creations are no less than anywhere
 lekin jaisaa aksar hota he, har uplabdhi ek duusare sandarbh main seemaa bhi ban jaati he
 In this book, Aditya is shown by giving long quotes from Gupta's poems that his works are full of poetry
 par unki kavitaaon main antarnihit saamaajikta or vaicharikta kii gahari or vyapak chaanbin nahin kii gai he
 If that had been done, it would have been a comprehensive critique book on Maithilisharan Gupta

 The selectors may also consider this in the future to not give much consideration to the performance of the IPL in the selection of the team as most of the players did not show ipl-like commitment

 janata janardan bhagwaan kaa rup hota he
 The people of Karnataka have responded to the misleaders

 is chunaav ne mere man kaa prabhavit kiya he
 'congress bets, Congress is yet to lose courage in the midst of the changing trends in the Karnataka assembly elections
 congress is samay rujhaanon main bijepi ke baad duusare number kii badi party dikh rahi he
 The BJP seems to be lagging behind by a majority and the Congress wants to try to form a government in Karnataka at least once
 iske tahat kumaraswami ne rajyapal se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is present in Karnataka, told reporters that he had a phone conversation with both Deve Gowda and his son Kumaraswamy
 unhone bataaya ki jedies ne is prastaav ko sweekaar kiya he
 Azad said that the JDS government will run
 unhone aage kaha ki shaam ko governor se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya jayega

 isse pehle, mangalvaar dopaher ko sonia gandhi ne karnataka main maujuud congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ko phone karke kaha ki vah jedies pramukh echdi devgauda se baat karen

 Nobody objected
 ab ve nai maangon ke saath aae hai jo hamaare liye sweekaarya nahin hai
 Amit Shah said that the imposition of President's rule was necessary because there could be an allegation that the Bharatiya Janata Party's temperament government was running
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi, aaj bhi rajyapal se sarkaar banane ke liye sampark kar saktaa he
 He said that the opposition is doing politics on this issue
 yah loktantr ke liye swasth parampara nahin he

 He also said that if anyone has suffered due to the coming of President's rule, it has happened to the Bharatiya Janata Party, because our caretaker government has gone

 film se nikaale jane par taapasi ne dukh vyakt kiya he
 He also said that he was not told anything about his removal from the film and that someone else was taken without being told
 jab maine isaki vajah poochi to mujhe thik-thaak vajah nahin bataai gai
 Let me tell you that the husband and wife were released in 1978

 The film was directed by Baldev Raj Chopra
 film ke lead rolls main vidya sinha or ranjita cor bhi the
 You want them to be offered very beautiful, fresh and absolutely fragrant flowers every day while worshiping the Lord
 parantu inhen jutaney main samasyaayein kai hai
 If you go to buy flowers, then you will know that they are also suffering from inflation
 is mandi se us mandi, us mandi se is mandi tak aate-aate inaki pankhudiyon par tanaav or thakaan ke bahuterey nishaan pad gaye hai
 When swinging on the branches, then there was no limit to the fragrance
 par jaise hi saudagaron ke haathon main aae, khushboo bhi kam ho gai
 Even if you go to buy the sticks, you will suffer
 koi brands nahin janchataa, koi pocket main nahin samaa paata
 In the pocket, there is 'smell' in it, but 'su' is missing
 devi-devataaon par chhidakane ke liye ghar main gangaajal khojein, to vah bhi nadaarad
 After all, how long will Gangajal kept in a small vessel for a year
 
 
 ?matlab yah ki ham apane ishtdev ko jo chijen bhautik rup se arpit karnaa chaahate hai, usamen kai tarah kii samasyaayein hai
 Shortage of funds, shortage of time, availability problems etc
 aakhir iskaa nidaan kya ho? bhagwaan ko khush kiya jaae to kaise?upaay bilkul sidhaa or saral he
 Many glories of Manas worship have been sung in our scriptures
 maanas puja kaa matlab he man hi man, dhyanpurvak bhagwaan kii stuti karnaa, man se unhen phool, chandan, itr, vastra, naivedhy aadi arpit karnaa
 It is necessary to clarify here that Manas Puja is not a method of worship practiced in any helplessness
 shastron main aisa ullekh miltaa he ki is tarah kii puja bhagwaan ko bhi sabase zyada priy he
 God is hungry for sentiment, not of any earthly things
 bhakt or prabhu ke bich bhaawanaaon ke jariye hi sambandh pragadh hota he
 It is said in Mudgalpurana: Kritvadau Mansi Pujanta: Pujana Samacharret
 isamen bataaya ja rahaa he ki agar bahari chizon se puja kerani hi ho, to bhi pehle maanas puja kii jaani chahie
 The best thing is that there is no limit to your thinking in Manas Puja
 aap sundar se sundar, taaja va sugandhit phool apane isht dev ko arpit kar sakate hai
 Here neither the price of flowers rubs your mind, nor is there any possibility of it becoming stale
 isi tarah gangotri se lekar gangasagar tak, kahin kaa bhi gangaajal secondon main uplabdh ho jaataa he, vah bhi jitna chahen, utana
 Similarly, other imaginary things always get ready
 maanas puja kii sabase badi khubi yah he ki jitani der sadhak man se in kaamon main juta rahata he, utani der vah sansaarik chizon se kataa rahata he
 God is very pleased with this type of worship, the seeker also comes into meditation
 aakhir puja-archana kaa uddeshy bhi to yahi he

 ) Questioning the Modi government during a debate in the Lok Sabha in a no-confidence motion against the government, Mallikarjun Kharge said that when Modi goes from power, it seems good days will come
 saath hi unhone sarkaar par kai sawaal daage or poocha ki kisaanon ke halaat kab sudharenge or kalaadhan kab aayega
 Mallikarjun Khargene said that Rajnath Singh has just taught us the history of the country
 karnataka ke har ek vyakti ko jo pataa he vah paath rajnath ji hamen padhaa rahe the
 You did not mention anything new, you should have told about the achievements of your government for four and a half years
 rajnath ramaman-mahabharat tak gaye, lekin sirf ram, bhim or krishna hi yaad aae, shanbuk or eklavya nahin
 Ram is in your mouth, a knife in your armpit
 congress ne bachaaya loktantrcongress ke is varisht netaa negrihamantri rajnath singhke loktantr vaale bayaan par jawaab dete hue kaha ki agar aaj ham aapke jaise chalate to loktantr khatm hi ho jaataa
 You tried to break the society, society is being pushed towards inequality, in such a way democracy would end
 congress ne loktantr bachaane kii koshish kii or yah aapako maananaa padegaa
 Kharge further said that during the discussion, it was repeatedly said that the opposition parties do not help, but you are not ready to make a small change in the Lokpal, so you do not have the right to speak about democracy
 aap vipakshi dal ke netaa ko lokapal main shaamil karne kaa sanshodhan ajtak nahin laae hai
 You talk big about democracy, but the truth is different
 avishvaas prastaav laane kii vajah par mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki tidipi, congress samet anya dalon ne iskaa notice diya
 He also thanked the speaker for giving him more time
 andhra kaa mudda uthaate hue khadge ne kaha ki ham aapke saath hai, phir bhi aap tidipi kii maang maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The government does not want Andhra Pradesh to get their rights, because in the last session we wanted to discuss but the government was not ready
 khadge ne kaha kicongressandhra pradesh ke logon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye har mumkin koshish karegi
 Despite not having the numbers here, all of us have supported this proposal of TDP
 iske alaava ensipi, muslim lig, sipiai or sipiem jaise dalon ne bhi is prastaav kaa samarthan kiya he
 Targeting the Vadamodi government, the government did not complete, Kharge said that the government had promised to double the income of farmers before coming to power, but according to what you promised, the price of crops was not increased
 sarkaar prachaar main zyada jor detii he or kaarobaari bhi aapke saath hai
 The decision to increase the MCP has been taken in view of the elections, but nothing will happen from that
 mallikarjun khadge ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bijepi samvidhan ko badalanaa chaahati he
 The government should tell when the black money of 80 lakh crores will be returned
 khadge ne kaha ki bainkon ke lutere waapas kab aaenge, kisaan kii haalat kab sudharenge, kalaadhan kab aayega, uniwarsity main pichhadon ko kab tak aarakshan milegaa is jawaab sarkaar ko dena hoga
 He said that when Modi ji goes from power, it seems good days will come
 bhaashan khatm karne ke baad khadge ne phir se khadey hokar kaha ki sarkaar ne deshavaasiyon ko mungery laal ke haseen sapane dikhaakar unhen luutane kaa kaam kiya he

 renuka ne turant us yujar ko sudhaarte hue 'dam' (baandh) or 'dam' (laanat) main ssailing kaa antar samajhaayaa
 Do you mean "damn"? Dams are built over rivers, to harness electricity
 You don't mean I'm a dam, right? Even if i wanted to be, i couldn't
 They are non living things
 Damn! Now may i correct your sentence? "you are just a damn actress" Yes i am! And I'm damn good! https: / / t
 co / pj3lsguc04 The actress said, "did you want to say dam (damn)? Because dam (dam) is used to stop the flow of river and make electricity
" tum mujhe yah vaala dam (baandh) nahin kahana chaahate the, kyon sahi he naa? kyonki yadi main chaahun, to bhi yah nahin ban sakati hum
 They are not alive
 dam (laanat)! ab kya main tumhaare vaakya ko sahi kar sakati hum? 'tum sirf ek dam actress' ho yah sahi he! or haa main hum
 "in Hali Hi, the actress reacted to the Prime Minister's tweet, in which she appealed to everyone to hold a peaceful demonstration and maintain peace on the Citizenship Amendment Act
 pradhanmantri ko jawaab dete hue renuka ne twit kar kaha tha, "sar, krupa karke logon se kahen ki vah aapke iti cell vaale twitor handle se dur rahen
 They spread rumors and falsities the most and are completely against brotherhood, peace and unity
 asal main tukade-tukade gang aapke iti cell main he sar
 Please stop them from spreading hate
 "sir, please ask people to stay away from all your IT cell Twitter handles then
 They spread the most amount of rumors, falsehoods and are totally against brotherhood, peace and unity
 The real

 Vikas sent this notice by his lawyer Shamsher
 notice main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki anuraag ne apni hi company kii sadsy ko ghoose dekar ye sab kaam karaayaa he
 So that he makes another charge of sexual harassment against Vikas
 "vikaas ne yah bhi saaf kiya he ki ve chaaron hi kuch maheenon se is baat ko lekar charchaa kar rahe the ki chaaron alag ho jaaenge, ham chaaron ke bich hi kaaphi kriyative difrences aa chuke the
 The notice also states that in the statement given by Anurag Kashyap on the same issue in the year 2017 and now the statements given are completely different from each other
 notice main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki pichley hi maheene motwani ne vikaas bahal se mulaakaat kii thi or kathith peedita se hui baatcheet kaa ek screenshot dikhaaya tha jisamen usne sexual asolt kii kisi bhi ghatana se inkaar kiya tha
 Please tell that Phantom Films was founded in 2011 by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwani, Vikas Bahl and Madhu Mantena

 In it, he said, "I withdraw my name from all duties of the Board of Members of MAMI
 duusari baat ye he ki main un sabhi aaropon ko khaarij karata hum jinke mutabiq 2015 main hue maamle par maine kabhi koi ection nahin liya
 In particular, i do not want to give clarification to those who do not understand the legal rules
 "main bahut sari mahilaon ke saath kaam karata hum, kai mahilaayein mere saath kaam karti hai
 i owe them all
 wo sab mere ection ke gavaah hai
 "" This is a time when we should look into ourselves and think how to face them all
 "anuraag kaa kahana he, "samay bitne ke saath maine ye baat sidhe tareeke se sikhi he sahmati kii rekha "nahin" kah dene bhar se paribhaashit nahin hoti he

 i first came to know about this in the year 2017 when Anurag called me and told me about it
 madhu, main or anuraag us ladki ke saath baithe or usne hamen puri dastaan sunai
 It was a shocking incident
 "anuraag ne kaha tha, ghatana handle karne ko lekar patibadyanurag ne kaha, "main ab ise thik se handle karne ko lekar patibaddh hum
 i have full faith in the woman
 us mahila ko puraa saport karata hum
 He said, whatever Vikas Bahl did is intimidating

 We will do whatever we can in this matter
 "kangana ne lagaaya vikaas par aaropakangna ne apane statement main likhaa tha, 'main is peedit par puri tarah se bharosa karti hum
 Vikas was still married while we were shooting for the film Queen, but he used to mention having a physical relationship with a new partner daily
 vikaas har raat party karte the or mujhe in partiyon main shaamil naa hone ke liye sharminda karte the
 Whenever Vikas met him, he would hug me strangely, sniff my hair and say that he loves this fragrance
 " The recent controversy over singer Honey Singh's lyrics has sparked a fierce debate in social media
 twitor par kai log hani singh kaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai jabaki kai kaa kahana he ki abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa sammaan hona chahie
 Shivam Garg wrote on Twitter that the FIR against Honey seems to be that the Indian system is confused about the rapper and the rapper (rapist)
 saf ali khan abhinit ‘cocktail’ ke geet ‘angareji beet’ se lokapriy hue raper hani singh dilli ke samuhik balaatkaar maamle ke baad vivaadon main ghir gayi
 After an online complaint, Honey had to cancel her program in Gurgaon on New Year's Eve

 Singh refused to write the disputed song on Twitter, accusing him of using it as an excuse
 haalanki internet par log is mudde par vibhajit hai
 Some people are questioning the Bollywood item song like 'sheila Ki Jawani', 'munni Badnaam Hui' 'hulkat Jawani', while others believe that freedom of expression should be respected
 film nirmaataa anuraag kashyap ne bhi hani singh kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki agar desh yah maanegaa ki hani singh ke kaaran balaatkaar hote hai to phir mujhe bhi kuch kehane dijie
 i will stand up and say that you do not know what you are doing, behaving like a crowd and then anything that bothers anyone should be banned
 kashyap ne kaha ki ham jitna naitik banenge or abhivyakti ko kaabo karne kaa prayaas karenge, utana zyada daman hoga
 Daman is the main root of most evils
 ek vyakti ne likhaa ki agar hani singh kaa geet bhadkau he to (dabang 2) ke karina kapur par filmaaye item sang (‘main to tandoori murgi hum yaar, gatkale sainyaa alcohol se) kya kam bhadkau he

 comkabi sanskrit main kavita karne vaale janaki vallabh shatri ne sooryakanth treepathi 'niraala’ kii prerana se hindi main geeti natya, kahani, upanyaas, aalochana or sansmaran aadi vidhaon main anek kritiyaan sahitya jagat ko deen
 But in the 'discussion' of the history and criticism of literature, his name is little known to the extent that even ordinary readers of Hindi, research scholars are also almost unfamiliar with his name and work
 kalidas jaisaa upanyaas, radha jaisaa mahakavy or sahitya darshan jaisi aalochanatmak kritiyon kaa lekhak bhi is prakaar se acharchit or aparichit rah saktaa he, shaayad hindi main hi sambhav he
 Gopeshwar Singh, a disciple and critic of Shastri, has resolved to bring to light his entire literature
 usee kii pehali kadi ke rup main kitabgar se chhapi unki sansmornatmak kriti hansbalaka kaa yah pun: prakaashan he
 Hansabalaka is more than half as Shastri's autobiography
 unhone prasad, niraala, premchand, agyeya, janendra or hajaari prasad dvivedi ke jo sansmornatmak chitra prastut kiye hai ve in sahityakaron ke kai alakshith pakshon ko prakat karte hai
 Only Shastri can describe prasad-premchand meeting together - "here Prasad and Premchand" both white people were sitting so close together
 prasad kaa cheharaa bharaa, anishchay, asantosh or aakroshahin, premchand kaa sookhaa mukh, andruni ulajhanein sulajhati-si jhurriyaan, gantavy par pahunchane kii pahchaan liye chamakili ankhen
 Of course there was a competition of laughter, but Premchand was overshadowed every time
 premchand kii hansi samudr mathne se bepanaah ufante jhag kii si or prasad ji kii sarovar ke nirmal tal se uthati taraltar tarangon jaisi thi
 "this quote not only exemplifies Shastri's unique language and style, but also points to his subtle observation
" shastri ko niraala kaa maanas putr kaha ja saktaa he
 Abhinandan Granth was planned on the Golden Jubilee of Nirala
 vah taiyaar na ho paaya to shastri ne swayan hajaar pannon kaa granth nikaalane kii thaanee
 However, that plan may not be completed
 par niraala ke jivan kaa satya shastri ne kuch hi shabdon main kah diya he: ''niraala ne ateet se vidroh kiya, apni ruchi kaa nayaa vartmaan gadhia chaha, kshamta kii bhatthi main pratibha ko pighalaaya, nit nae saanchon main dhaala; par nateeja kya niklaa? rachana ke kuch gulab khile or jindagi kii daal kaanton se lad gai
 Admittedly, the art is not shallow, but in the flow of life, it has become a vortex
 ”hajaari prasad dvivedi kaa jaisaa virat vyaktitv tha, usee ke anuroop un par lekh bhi sabase lanbaa he
 Such a 'fine memoir' has not been written on him till date
 aisi adbhut pratibha or apratim style ke baavjood shastri saahitiyik itihaas ke maanchitr par alakshith se hi kyon rahe? tamaam bade aalochakon-lekhakon-samikshakon ke paas shaayad iskaa koi uttar nahin
 After Gopeshwar ji, Hansabalaka, how long are the other works of Shastri ji coming
 shastri ji ke rahete to nahin lekin sambhavat: ab unako unka prapya milane kaa samay aa gaya he

 The teachers alleged that the Social Science Department recently received a 'threatening letter' asking them to list the voters who voted against this system

 Professor Pramesh Ratnakar, a teacher of English at Deendayal Upadhyay College, said, "if the administration is so willing to change the semester system then it should be done on a tark basis in which there is justice to the subject and our way of teaching is also not hurt
 Not only the subject but also the overall development of the students is included

 And as he descended into the shadow of Rama in Nirala's Shakti worship of Rama, he found what he was probably looking for
 tulsi ke maryaada purushottam or niraala ke manushyavat ram main fark kya-kya hai, aise pakshon par kavi-nirdeshak vyomesh shukla se lambii charchaaon ne unka samaadhaan kiya

 In Karnataka, the magic of the biggest face of BJP, BS Yeddyurappa, is speaking, and due to this, BJP has come close to majority
 dakshin bharat main bijepi duusari baar satta main aati dikh rahi he or is kamyaabi kaa sehara yediurppa ke sir bandhata he, jinhone 2008 ke chunaav main 'oparation lotus' ke jariye satta hasil kii thi, us chunaav main bijepi ne 110 siten jitkar sarkaar banaai thi
 Moving from a rice mill clerk and a farmer leader, Yeddyurappa became a lotus-feeding hero in the south as the BJP government in Karnataka for the first time
 or ab 2018 main unhone ek baar phir bijepi kii satta main vaapasi lagbhag sunishchit kar di he
 It is known that Yeddyurappa had become the villain for BJP when the assembly elections were held five years ago in 2013
 2018 ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav membijepiyediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaakar chunavi maidan main utari
 He worked hard to feed the lotus for the second time in the state
 yediurppa apni puraani paramparaagat shikaripura vidhansabha seat se chunaav lade the
 It is considered a Lingayat dominated seat
 yediurppa khud lingayat samudaay se aate hai
 The Congress has fielded GB Maltesh against him
 vahiin jedies ne achti baligar par daanv lagaaya he
 BS Yeddyurappa has completed 75 years of age
 unka janm 27 farvari 1943 ko rajya ke mandya jile ke bukanakere main siddhalingappa or puttathyammaa ke ghar hua tha
 He lost his mother at the age of four
 siyaasi safaryediurppa rajya ke sabase prabhavi lingayat samudaay se aate hai
 In 1972, he was elected president of Shikaripura taluka Jana Sangh and entered politics
 1977 main janata party ke sachiv pad par kabiz hone ke saath hi raajnneeti main unka kad or bad gaya
 First time MLA His real political career started in 1983 when he reached the assembly for the first time and since then he has been elected MLA from Shikaripura 7 times
 wo teesri baar party ke pradesh adhyaksh kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe hai
 For the first time, the BJP won a landslide victory in the 2008 assembly elections thanks to Yeddyurappa, the CM for 7 days
 hameshaa safed safari suut main najar aane vaale yediurppa navambar 2007 main janata dal (es) ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar girane se pehle bhi 7 dinon ke liye mukhyamantri rahe the
 In 2008, Kamal Khilayediyurappane started 'operation Lotus' campaign in Karnataka from Operation Lotus campaign
 is abhiyaan ke jariye bijepi ne rajya main camel khilaane kii baat kahi thi
 For this, BJP workers went door-to-door to talk about bjp's policies
 camel ko hindutv ke pratik ke taur par bhi pesh kiya tha
 The BJP managed to win a majority in the 224-member assembly in 2008 on 'operation Lotus', but the influential Reddy brothers Janardhana and Karunakar, who belonged to the mining sector, remained in trouble for them
 sankaton bharaa rahaa siem kaarykalakarnataka main bijepi ke liye camel khilaane vaale bies yediurppa ke teen saal 62 dinon kaa kaarykaal sankaton se bharaa rahaa
 Let us tell you that the Lokayukta report in the mining scam became a sore throat for Yeddyurappa and he had also lost his chief ministerial chair due to corruption
 un par jameen or avaidh khanan ghotaale ke aarope lage the
 After this he went to jail and was released again
 iske baad unhone bijepi se baghawat karke apni party kaa gathan kiya
 Once again, the BJP imposed bets in the assembly elections in 2008, along with the BJP, they had to face a crushing defeat
 iske baad modi ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar banane ke baad janvari 2013 main unki dobaaraa bijepi main vaapasi hui
 Recovering from one crisis after another, Yeddyurappa has proved himself as a political figure within the party
 2018 ke chunavi nattejey isaki shandaar gavaahi dete hai
 The central government made 25 more files related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose public
 ab saarvajanik kii gai filon kii taadaad 250 ho gai
 Most of the files made public this time belong to the Ministry of External Affairs
 is baar bhi filon ko saarvajanik karne kaa naa to koi samaaroh hua or naa hi mantri ne is kaarykram main bhaag liya
 This time also a famous file related to the Prime Minister's Office has not been made public, some pages of which are torn, that is, missing
 pichhali baar hi ye file is vajah se roak lee gai thi ki kahin koi vivaad naa bade
 So far, 250 files related to Netaji, despite 250 files out of thousands of files kept in the Central Government's basements and national archives, so far no such facts have been revealed which provide strong evidence that Netaji was still alive after August 1945
 haalanki abhi bhi bada sawaal ye he ki aakhir netaji ke parivaar ke logon kii jasusi kyon karai ja rahi thi
 But most of the facts have come before in the books written about Netaji
 netaji par research karne waalon ko milegi madadfilhal sarkaar ke paas vibhinn mantralayon se sambandhit 990 filein ab bhi hai
 Apart from this, 271 files related to the Kholsa Commission, 759 files related to the Mukherjee Commission and 1030 files of the Ministry of Home Affairs are in the National Archive
 inako dhire-dhire treet kar digitimed kiya ja rahaa he, taaki inhensamay-samayper saarvajanik kiya ja sake
 At the moment, the benefits of making these files public will be available to those who research about Netaji
 sarkaar or sthaneey prashasan kii lagaataar koshishon ke baavjooddilli-ensiarmempradooshanke str main koi kami nahin aa rahi or in sabake bichsupreme courtkapatakhonper se kuch sharton ke saath bain hataanaa ek behad ahm faisla he jo ki tay karegaa ki is saal diwaali ke baad dilli kii aabo-hawa kisi rahegi
 The Supreme Court has lifted the ban on the sale of firecrackers with some conditions
 court neicofrendli pataakheki baat kahi he lekin uski pahchaan kaise hogi? jo pataakhe abhi bazaaron main bik rahe hai kya wo ecofrendli hai or agar nahin to unka kya hoga? kya logon ko tay samay seemaa main pataakhe jalaane tak simit rakhaa ja saktaa he? aise kai sawaal he jinke jawaab ab prashasan or jaanch agenciyo ko denne honge
 Who will investigate firecrackers? Actually, the Supreme Court removed the ban on firecrackers across the country, saying that the constitutional right of firecrackers and sellers to live their livelihoods cannot be ignored but the public interest and health of the country also get attention This ban is being removed with certain conditions
 court ne ek nishchit tay samaysima sima (shaam 8 baje se raat 10 baje tak) main lau emishan pataakhon ko jalaane kii anumati di he
 In addition, PESCO (petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization) has been given the responsibility to check the pollution emission level of firecrackers arriving in the markets and also check the firecrackers already in the market
 bazaar main sanshay kii sthiticourt ke is faisle ke baad bazaar main khushi to he par abhi bahut sara kanfusion bhi bana hua he
 Shopkeepers are haphazardly selling old firecrackers without having to do a pollution level check, and buyers also do not see any difference at the moment
 faisle ke baad bazaar kii raunak ai he
 Fireworks have started selling in Sadar Bazaar, Filmistan Bazaar, Chandni Chowk and other markets
 logon khushi he ki pataakhon kii anumati mil gai
 Now firecrackers will be burnt very strongly, so some believe that a ban on firecrackers was necessary
 sadar bazaar kii sthitilogon kii milijuli pratikriya ke bich hamane sadar bazaar kaa jayja liya to paaya ki puure sadar bazaar main is samay pataakhe kii keval ek dukaan khuli hui he, baaki ko license nahin mila
 a shopkeeper said that he was happy with the court's decision and this time he expected good shoplifting
 lau emishan pataakhon ko lekar usko zyada jaankaree nahin hone par jo pataakhe wo bech rahaa he unki jaanch ke liye bhi hami bhar di
 But if the ground reality is seen, then the biggest challenge before the administration will be to stop the firecrackers being sold
 logon kii roycourt ke faisle ke baad PESCO ke liye un pataakhon ko jaanchana aasaan he jo abhi bazaaron tak nahin pahunche hai lekin wo pataakhe jo in dinon bazaaron main dhadlle se bik rahe hai un par ankush lagaana naammumkin hoga
 According to Malviya Nagar's RWA chief Rajiv Rao, it is not possible to stop people from burning firecrackers
 malviya nagar ardblue ne green diwaali kii parampara kii shuruyaat kii he jisamen socity ke log mil kar park main taron kii chhaanv main ek saath mil kar gaanaa bajaanaa karte hai or saath hi apane-apane gharon se khaane ke alag-alag vyanjan bana kar le jate hai
 They believe that it is much better than the noise and smoke of firecrackers

 duniya bhar main kai aise cricketer hue jinhone maidan main badi badi misaalen kaayam kin
 Some won the hearts of the people with their ball and bat, some made an impression in the mind of crores of cricket lovers by their game as well as their nature
 aise hi kuch cricketron main pakistan ke abdul rajjak bhi hai
 Razzaq earned a big name at a very young age, but despite this, his ego never dominated
 unhone apane virodhiyon ko kabhi munh se nahin, balki hameshaa apane khel se jawaab diya
 Abdul Razzaq, who is a faceless smile, is celebrating his 35th birthday on Tuesday
 pakistan cricket team apane khilaadiyon ke vyavhaar ko lekar hameshaa hi charchaa main rahi he
 From Javed Miandad to Shahid Afridi, he was often criticized for his blatant and irresponsible statements
 lekin usee team kaa hissaa rahe abdul rajjak ne apane khel or apane shaleen vyavhaar ke jariye cricket premiyon ke dil main alag jagah banaai
 Abdul Razzaq, one of the finest all-rounders in the world, was born on 2 December 1979 in Lahore
 unhen apana pehla vanade 1996 main khilne kaa mauka mila
 However, he did not get much chances initially and played only 13 odis in the first three years
 lekin 1999 main rajjak paak team ke niyamit sadsy ban gaye, or phir unhone peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Razzaq gave a tough fight to Waqar, Wasim and Shoaib Akhtar
 Abdul Razzaq's entry into the Pakistani team was when Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram were at their peak
 in donon gendbaajon ke saamne achche achche apane ghutane tekte dikhaai dete the
 Just think how difficult it must have been when Razzaq made a different identity among these veterans
 rajjak ne apni raftaar or reverse swing se duniya bhar ke ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya
 In 1997, Shoaib Akhtar also joined Pakistan's fast bowling fleet
 lekin rajjak ne apni sateek gendbaaji se in teenon tej gendbaajon ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar pakistan ko kai match jitaaye
 He took 269 wickets in 265 odis for Pakistan, while Razzaq has 100 wickets in 46 Tests
 
 
 
 When Razzaq hit Glenn mcgrath for 5 consecutive fours in a single over, he was not only famous for his bowling but also for his stormy batting
 2000 main australia ke khilaaf ek match main rajjak ne glen mcgra ko ek hi over main lagaataar 5 chauke jad die the
 In that triangular series, Razzaq was awarded the title of 'man of the Series' for his all-round performance
 toornament kii teesri team bharat thi
 However, Australia defeated Pakistan in the final
 rajjak ne 265 vanade main 5080 ran banaae, jabaki 46 test main rajjak ke naam 1946 ran hai
 Some special things: * Abdul Razzaq holds the world record for taking hat-trick at the youngest (20 years) in Test cricket
 rajjak ne june 2000 main srilanka ke khilaaf yah karnama anjaam diya tha

 bharat ratna se sammanit purv cricketer sachin tendulkar ne apane kariyar ke dauraan shaayad hi cricket se alag kabhi kuch kaha ho
 Whenever Sachin spoke, always talk of cricket
 sachin ko ek baar tab pratikriya karte dekha gaya, jab 2007 world cap ke dauraan greg chapel ne unka ballebaaji kram badalane kii koshish kii thi
 Sachin's autobiography 'playing it my way' has been in the news for the past few days due to its revelations
 apni kitaab main sachin ne tatkaaleen coach greg chapel ko team ko todane kii koshish karne vaala bataaya he
 In 2007, when Sachin tried to explain the reason for landing as a salute pair, some people saw his side as selfish
 sachin ko laga ki bhartiya team ke prati unki patibaddhta par sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 At that time, the Indian team could not enter the second phase in the World Cup
 world cap se lautne ke baad sachin or chapel ke bich manmutav khulkar saamne aa gaya or sachin yah maamla bisisiai tak lekar gaye
 The story started to unfold in such a way that it has been seen many times that the BCCI has shown the way out to the coaches, taking the side of their senior players
 kai baar to senior khilaadiyon ne team par pad rahe kharaab asar ko dekhte hue kai saathi khilaadiyon ko bhi baahar kaa rasta dikhaane main bhoomika nibhaai he
 Chappell, in an interview a few years ago, expressed regret over his decision to force Sachin to bat at the lower order
 aise main sachin ke kathan ko itihaas ke kram main dekha janaa chahie ki aakhir us world cap main vastav main hua kya tha
 Chappell suggested Sachin to replace Rahul Dravid as captain based on some technical data
 haalanki chapel kaa kahana he ki vah world cap 2007 se kareeb 12 maheene pehle sachin ke ghar gaye the
 The manner in which Tendulkar has written Chappell's statement is similar to what is happening between the two kingdoms of Mumbai regarding their jurisdiction
 tendulkar kii aatmakatha 'plaing it maai ve' main sachin ne chapel ke hawaale se likhaa he, 'rahul dravid se team kaa niyantran apane haath main lene main meri madad karen
 So that we can control Indian cricket for years
 'kya vaaki chapel ke kareeb the dravid?bhartiya cricket team ke 2005 se 2007 tak coach rahe austrailian chapel par tendulkar ne apni pustak main jamkar bhadaas nikaali he
 Tendulkar wrote, 'chappell was like a ringmaster who used to impose his views on players
 chaahe khilaadi ke liye vah suvidhajanak ho yaa nahin
 Former captain Saurabh Ganguly was then the only one to speak against Chappell and had to lose his captaincy in return
 ganguli ne tab sansanikhej khulaasa karte hue kaha tha ki chapel ne dravid ko apane paksh main karke unhen captaini se hataaya
 But here a disputed situation arises that if Dravid was so close to the chapel, how could Tendulkar be made the captain by removing him
 haalanki is puure maamle se dravid ne khud ko puri tarah alag rakhaa he
 He said, 'he is not entitled to speak in a private conversation between two persons
 ' sachin ke paksh main tab harbhajan singh or jahir khan saamne aae the or donon ne chapel par khilaadiyon ke bich matbhed or asuraksha paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In fact, Chappell came to India with completely new ideas and he did not know that he was going to put his hand in the snake's bill and his absolutely new ideas were not going to be accepted here
 chapel ne hi sabase pehle kahana shuru kiya tha ki mahendra singh dhauni yaa dinesh karthik main captain banane kii kshamta he, jo senior khilaadiyon se dabaav kam kar sakate hai
 It is also known that Chappell tried to get VVS Laxman to start the innings and said that Laxman's Test cricket is towards the end
 kuch bhi ho ek khilaadi ke taur par sachin ke yogadan par sawaal nahin khadaa kiya ja saktaa
 Those who believe them to be God will keep their writing on their eyes and of course when publishers bring the autobiography of such a great player, then their aim is to bring something that will compel the supporters of the author to buy the book

 Punia said, "these teams have been asked to be vigilant so that there is no attempt to match unused evms with the used evms on counting day
 ham koi chance nahin le sakate
 'veteran Congress leader Motilal Vora, who constantly meets party leaders of Chhattisgarh, said, evms will be closely monitored

 'congress is also very cautious about the tabulation of votes
 puniya ne bataaya, agenton kii ore se voton kii tebulation list saavdhaanee se banaai jaani chahie

 ’ congress saansad tii sahu ne kaha, bijepi jis tarah sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog karti he, use dekhte hue hamen bahut satark rahanaa chahie
 We have taken some precautionary steps and we are ready for the counting day

 ) diemke party ke pramukh em karunanidhi ne apane bete emke alagiri ke party se nilamban ke baad apane kadam par kaha ki alagiri ko stallin se shikaayat thi or usne uske khilaaf sakht bhashaa kaa prayog kiya or yahaan tak kah diya ki stallin kii kuch hi maheenon main maut ho jaaegi
 Karunanidhi said that how can a father tolerate this
 karunanidhi ne kaha, 'vah (alaagiri) stallin ke khilaaf nafrat rakhte hai
 Alagiri even said that Stalin would die in three months
 koi pita kisi bete ke khilaaf aise shabdon ko nahin sun saktaa
 i had to tolerate them as party president
 ' Describing Alagiri's withdrawal from the party, the DMK president said that his elder son came to his house on the morning of 24 January and spoke harsh words against Stalin
 karunanidhi ne poocha, 'kya apni samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye party adhyaksh ke ghar aane kaa yah (subah 6-7 baje) vakt he
 When asked about Alagiri's statements against the party in Madurai, Karunanidhi said that Alagiri is interviewing newspapers and channels against the party's decision of the General Council and the Working Council, resulting in unintended political consequences
 karunanidhi ne yah bhi kaha ki mujhe yah samaj nahin aata ki aakhir kyon alagiri ke bheetar stallin ke prati itani nafrat kyon he
 Because of this factionalism has also been taking place in the party
 gauratlab he ki pichley hafte diemke pramukh ne madurai ke pramukh netaa, purv kendriyamantri tathaa karunanidhi ke putr emke alagiri par karrwai karte hue dramuk ne unhen party kii praathmik sadsyta or sabhi padon se nilambit kar diya tha or unase kaha he ki dramuk-emdmake gathbandhan ke unke virodh ko halke main nahin liya jayega
 Party general secretary k Anbazhagan said on the action against Alagiri, 'this statement reflects the high command's stand
 ' karunanidhi emdmake ke saath gathbandhan ke paksh main the or unhone haal main alagiri kii tippanee se khud ko alag kar liya tha
 On 7 January, in a stern warning to his son, the DMK president said that anyone who would go against the party's stance on an important subject like the coalition would face disciplinary action including expulsion
 alagiri ko party se asthaayee taur par nilambit kiye jane kaa nirnay unke apane pita se mulaakaat ke kuch hi ghante baad saamne ai he
 The timing of the suspension is considered to be very important, as the DMDK is scheduled to meet on February 2 in which Vijayakanth can make an announcement about the alliance in the context of the Lok Sabha elections
 dramuk netaaon ko lagata he ki is karrwai se sahi sandesh jayega
 The DMDK chief was hurt when Alagiri said that he would never consider the captain (vijayakanth as his party people call him) a political figure
 alagiri par party rukh ke khilaaf jane or vijayakaanth ke netritv vaale emdmake se gathjod karne ke vishay par alag vichaar vyakt karne ke aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Alagiri has been temporarily removed from all posts, including the dmk's primary membership

 Narendra Modi's visit to America has been historic in many ways
 bharat ravaanaa hone se pehle america videsh mantri jon kairi ne modi ko mahatma gandhi ke baraabar khadaa kar diya
 In fact, Narendra Modi had said that as Gandhi made the freedom struggle a mass movement, similarly we should make development a mass movement
 modi chaahe hindustan main hon yaa baahar, apane har bhaashan main ve rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ko yaad karte hai
 Be it Rajghat in Delhi, Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat or Gandhi Statue in Washington
 modi ko jab bhi mauka miltaa he, wo baapu ko yaad karte hai
 But Modi would not have imagined that when he was returning from America, the world's most powerful country would be comparing him to Gandhi
 paanch din ke america daure ke aakhri din uparashtrapati jo biden kii taraf se modi ke sammaan main die gaye lunch main america videsh mantri jon kairi ne unhen gandhi ke baraabar khadaa kar diya
 Carrie said, 'we want to remember Prime Minister Modi's contribution to India's development and Mahatma Gandhi's contribution to India's independence in a way
 'yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab kairi ne modi kii khulkar tarif kii he
 Earlier in July, when he visited India, he praised Modi's slogan 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', while heartily praising his journey from 'chaiwala' to PM here
 vikaas kaaryakramon kii tarif ek baat he or modi ko gandhi ke baraabar khadaa karnaa alag baat
 Modi has just four months to take charge of India and he has yet to bring the country's economy back on track
 lekin isse pehle hi us america ne modi ko itnaa bada tamgaa de diya, jo unke piem banane tak vija dene tak se kataraa rahaa tha
 The question arises, how did America get such a big change of heart? Whatever it may be, this will be a major victory for Modi in the five-day US tour
