 7 may 2018 ko unke jinda hone kaa pataa chalaa tha or pakistan jail main hai
 In the document, the address of the village of Gajanand has been stated as the Mahar Kala village in Samod in Jaipur district
 police ne apni report main bataaya tha ki bahut saalon se gajanan kaa parivaar jaipur ke brahampuri main rahane laga he
 According to the Government of India, a file of evidence of Gajanand, the prince of Bundi of Rajasthan and Jaisingh of Ajmer in the jail of Pakistan, was also sent to the Home Department of the Government of Rajasthan
 bataa den ki ajmer police ne jai singh ke parijan nahin milane kaa hawala dekar file waapas lautaa di thi
 But the release of 25-year-old Jugraj of Rampuria village in Bundi district has not been reported

 sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) ke rajdoot ahamed al banna ne dubai main anderworld don daaud ibrahim ke thikaanon par chhapemari sambandhi media reports kaa khandan kiya he
 He dismissed all the media reports that the news of Dawood's confiscation of property worth Rs 15,000 crore was completely baseless
 kuch hafton pehle soshal media main piem modi ko badhai dete hue kai twits viral hue the
 In these tweets, the action taken against Dawood in Dubai was credited to PM Modi as being the masterstroke of pm's diplomacy
 saath hi daaud kii takreeban 15 hajaar karod rupee kii sampatti sij karwaane ke liye piem modi ko dhanyavad diya ja rahaa tha
 At the same time, many facts related to this were also continuously released from the bjp's official social media cell
 kathith facts ke mutabik, pradhanmantri ne 2015 main sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) kii apni yatra ke dauraandaaud kii sampattiyonki ek suchi yuai adhikariyon ko saunpi thi or daaud ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii thi
 In exclusive talks with our affiliate news channel India Today, UAE Ambassador Ahmed Al Banna denied all these reports on social media
 unhone kaha, kisi bhi vyakti ke khilaaf karrwai karne se pehle unke desh main kanoonee prakriyaaon kaa mukhya rup se paalan kiya jaataa he
 Excerpts from the conversation between India Today channel deputy editor Smita Sharma and Foreign Ambassador Ahmed Al Banna: Smita Sharma: In recent years, we have seen that some people have been deported as per extradition treaty between India and UAE
 anderworld dondood ibrahim ke bare main khabaren thim ki bharat kii ore se enese ajit dobhaal ne yuai ko daaud ke khilaaf dogier saunpa he? kya aap is khabar kii pushti karte hai?videshi rajdoot ahamed al bannadamain jaanata hum ki vahaan (yuai) par antarrashtriya niyam-kanoon hai
 Bilateral agreements have been reached between the two countries and these agreements are decided by both countries through pragmatism and mutual understanding
 antarrashtriya dhaanchon ke tahat sin kiye gaye samjhaute kanoonee or nyaayik vyavastha ke antargat aate hai
 It is true that the NSA of the two countries met several times, but i do not have any information according to which Dawood was raided against his bases in the UAE
 smita sharmawahaan (yuai) kii bhi reports he ki daaud ke thikaanon par chhapemari kii gai he
 We do not know if this is true, false
 aap is baat kii pushti karnaa chahenge?videshi rajdoot ahamed al bannabhyah pehali baar he ki maine iske bare main suna he
 i do not know anything about this
 jaisaa ki maine bataaya sanyukt arab emirate ek aisa desh he, jahaan niyam hai, kaayade-kanoon hai or samvidhan hai
 If the legal proceedings in the country are connected with the judicial proceedings then i believe that it should be left as is
 meraa maananaa he ki kanoonee or nyaayik kaarywahi ke bagaiyr desh main kisi par bhi karrwai nahin kii ja sakati
 Smita Sharma: If you see any evidence in the evidence submitted by Dawood Ibrahim against India, will the UAE take action against Dawood? Foreign Ambassador Ahmed Al Banna: As i have already said that there are agreements between the two countries , Then under him only action can be taken on any particular person
 samjhauton ke tahat hi donon desh aapas main baatcheet karenge or phir sabooton ke aadhaar par hi sanyukt rup se karrwai kii jaaegi

 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in) August 25, 2017 ghar main AK-56 rakhane ke maamle main sanjay dutt ko jail bhijwane main ahm role play karne vaale patrkaar balajit parmaar ne sanjay dutt ke jivan par bani film sanju dekhne se manaa kar diya he
 He described the film as a medium to earn money
 fasebuk post karte hue balajit ne likhaa ki ''kisi bhi khaas purush yaa mahila par bani is tarah kii byopic film logon ko prerit karne ke uddeshy se nahin banati hai
 Their purpose is to tarnish the real image of that person from the mind of the people
 ''6 din main 200 karod ke kareeb sanju, box offis par kamaal jari''drugs kaa seven karnaa, mahilaon ke saath sona, system or socity ko hameshaa doshi tehraana, jaanboojh kar khud ko galat kaamon main shariq karnaa, apni puraani galatiyon par pashchaatap naa karnaa, jabardastee kii sahanbhuti lenaa or dikhaawati aasuun bahaanaa agar yahi ''sanju'' he to mujhe film dekhne ke liye naa jane ke apane nirnay par koi khed nahin he
 "let me tell you that in 1993, Baljeet Parmar, who worked in a Mumbai newspaper, broke a news about Sanjay Dutt
 isamen unhone sanjay dutt par AK- 56 jaise khatarnaak hathiyaar rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Five days after this, when Sanjay Dutt returned from shooting from abroad, he was arrested
 sanju par aise trol ho rahe hiraani, yugers ne bataaya-3 ghante kaa prisake baad sanjay dutt par TADA act ke tahat aarope lage the
 Apart from this, he was convicted under the Arms Act and was sentenced to 6 years
 film nirdeshak rajkumaar hiraani ne sanjay dutt ke jivan par film banaai jisamen ranbir kapur ne sanju baba kaa kirdaar play kiya
 The film is also being well liked by the audience
 haalanki kuch log iskaa virodh bhi kar rahe hai or ise byopic kii shrenee main nahin rakh rahe hai

 Film: Gabbar Is Baccarating: 2
 5 stardiarector:krishaklakaarathkshay kumaar, shruti hasan, suman talwaar or sunil grover'gabbar'jaisi film dekhakar aamir khan kaa vah gaanaa dimag main ghoomane lagata he ki 'dil he ki maanata nahin'
 So is our Bollywood who is not ready to accept it
 kuch nayaa karne ko iskaa dil karata hi nahin
 Just serves a film every Friday with the hope that he has worked very hard and the film is worth 100 crores
 kaa aankada paar kar legi
 'gabbar Is Back' is also a film made with the same intentions
 akshay apni pichhali kuch filmon ke saath sandesh dene kii koshish karte aa rahe hai, phir chaahe yah 'baby' ho 'holiday' yaa phir ab 'gabbar ij back'
 The purpose of the film is good, but it seems that the director has vowed not to mind, and he does not understand that the public has become smarter
 use south kii rimek banaakar bahalaaya nahin ja saktaa
 The film runs in the flow, but everything seems to be stuck
 har cheez dekhi hui lagati he
 That too many times
 kahani main kitna darrkshay kumaar hameshaa sahi raah par chalane vaala professor he or uskaa lakshya yahi he ki vah nai peedi main kuch karne ke liye josh jagaae or prerit kare
 He is fighting corruption
 lekin uskaa ek ateet he, jisamen vah kuch logon kii beyimaani se apane parivaar ko kho baithta he
 This is also the real reason for his fight
 vah bhrasht adhikariyon ke safaye kii disha main kadam badhaata he or gabbar ban jaataa he
 There is no hesitation in bringing any corrupt government official to its end
 film kaa luk bahut kuch south kii filmon jaisaa he
 This may have been due to its remake, but this is missed
 kya bollywood creativity ke maamle main itnaa kangaal ho chukaa he?star apilafilm hameshaa kii tarah jaisaa bollywood ke superstars ke maamle main hota he, sirf hero ke liye banaai gai he
 In such a situation, Majal is able to show his character or work
 akshay kumaquechche lagate hai
 Such rolls can only do that
 kairactor main jamate hai
 But now please do something new
 sunil grover thode ajeeb lagate hai kyonki hamane unhen gutthi ke role main zyada conect kiya he
 But he has done a good job in the role of a policeman
 shruti hasanko kaaphi mehnat kerani he
 Acting and dialog delivery have to be taken care of
 main villen suman talwaar ekadam south mark villen hai
 Talking about the earnings: Sanjay Leela Bhansali gave a hit like 'rowdy Rathore' with Akshay Kumar last time
 yah film bhi south kii rimek thi, lekin jaayaka or van liner mjedaar the
 It is missing in x Factor 'gabbar'
 film kaa sangeet acha he
 The budget of the film is around 70 crores
 bataaya ja rahaa he
 The way the farmers of the country are suffering with the weather, similarly the Indian box office is gasping because of the Bollywood films
 'gabbar' se ise bahut ummiden hai lekin yah film hausale bahut badhaati lagati nahin he
 a new twist has come in the ongoing corruption case against bjp's Karnataka unit president BS Yeddyurappa
 karnataka administration sarvice ke adhikari ne rajyapal ko patr likhakar is bare main khulaasa kiya he
 The officer said in his letter that he was pressurized to make a statement against the then Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa
 adhikari ne patr main kaha he ki use bayaan dene ke liye dhamkee di gai ki or kaha gaya ki aisa na karne par use maamle main sah aaropee bana diya jayega
 Yeddyurappa, the first CM of BJP in South India, Yeddyurappa is once again the face of BJP in Karnataka

 This was the first BJP government in South India
 haalanki july 2011 main avaidh khanan par lokayukta santosh hegade dwaara saunpi gai report main yediurppa ko doshaaropit kiye jane ke baad unhen mukhyamantri pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The report found Rs 10 crore from Prerna Trust from South West Mining Company and 1 at Rochenhalli by the mining company
 02 acre jameen kharidne ke badale main trust ko 20 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiye jane kii baat kahi gai thi
 The trust is owned and managed by Yeddyurappa's family

 karnataka main agle varsh kii shuruyaat main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai jiske liye party ne 150 se zyada seat jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Shah will interact with the party people at various levels and may also advise senior leaders to stay united as the party had to face embarrassment due to open accusations and counter-accusations among senior leaders till recently

 a good sleep serves as energy
 agar neend nahin puri ho rahi ho to bhi aapaki sex life prabhavit ho sakati he

 But what happened to Nitish Kumar, who did not go to the house of those victims and reached Delhi to participate in the secularism meeting of 14 parties? As chief minister of his state, he had a duty to go to the victims' home or send a personal messenger to console them

 bharat or nepal ne ek-duusare se lagane vaali apni seemaa ke har khambhe par global pojishning system (jeepies) lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 The decision to this effect was taken at the second indo-nepal Border Working Group (BWG) meeting on 26-27 August in Dehradun
 baithak main tay kiya gaya ki donon desh apni 1,880 kilometre lambii seemaa par 83 niyantran ikai (control point) banaaenge or seemaa par lage sabhi 8553 khambhon par jeepies lagaayenge
 Madhusudan Adhikari, Director General, Survey Department, who led the Nepali side in the conversation, said, "once the GPS is installed, the search for these poles will be easier when they are harmed by a natural disaster or someone will encroach upon it
 " The reason for the two countries' consent on GPS is the challenge arising on the issue of border demarcation after the pillars move from their place
 abhi inke abhaav main yah tay karne main dikkatein pesh aati hai ki pehle ye khambhe kis jagah par the
 The official said that the GPS will be permanently installed on the poles
 unhone bataaya ki seemaa ke donon taraf banane vaali 83 niyantran ikaiyaan (control point) seemaa par lage khambhon ke bare main har tarah kii jaankariyaan rakhengi
 It has also been agreed to install special pillars in the rivers and drains on the border between the two countries and in Someshwar with dense forests
 tippaniyan According to the official, out of total 8553 pillars, 1325 are missing and 1956 are in damaged condition
 unhone kaha, "ham gaayab ho chuke khambhon kii jagah par nae khambhe lagaayenge or jo bache hue hai unhen safed rang se rangenge
 " beadbluji baithak main edidije str kii survey adhikari samiti ke liye nae disha nirdesh bhi tay kiye gaye
 This committee works at the grassroots level
 yah seemaa ke donon taraf (kalapani or susta ko chhodkar ) nirmaan-marammat-punasrthapanaur 'no mans land' kii safai kaa kaam dekhati he
 It was decided in the meeting that the two countries would build 83 control units (control points) on their 1,880 km border and put GPS on all 8553 pillars along the border
 baatcheet main nepali paksh kaa netritv karne vaale surveykshan vibhaag ke mahanideshak madhusudan adhikari ne bataaya, "ek baar jeepies lagane ke baad in khambhon kii talash us sthiti main aasaan ho jaaegi jab kisi prakritik aapadaa main inhen nuksaan pahonchega yaa koi vyakti iskaa atikaraman karegaa
 " jeepies par donon deshon kii sahmati kii vajah khambhon ke apni jagah se idhar-udhar hone ke baad seemaa ke nirdhaaran ke mudde par uthne vaali chunauti he
 At present, there is a problem in deciding where these pillars were earlier

 However, Twitter also said, "today is the fastest growing market for bharattwitter worldwide and we will continue to invest on our specific projects to increase audience and user engagement here"
 pichley kuch dinon se bhartiya cricket main khel ke alaava har mudda charchaa main he
 The coach-captain fight, the captain's insistence on a new coach, the humiliation of the big players
 lekin ant main vahi hua jo captain viraat kohli chaahate the
 Ravi Shastri was made the coach of the Indian team, after that Ravi Shastri also got the right to choose his team with complete leeway and Bharat Arun, Sridhar was associated with the team as bowling and fielding coach
 lekin is puure vivaad ke bich bisisiai ek badi bhul kar baitha
 The advisory committee formed by the BCCI to reform cricket and take big decisions proved to be dwarfed by the insistence of just one captain
 bisisiai yah bhul gaya ki agar bharat main cricket ko ek dharm kii tarah puja jaataa he ki uski ek badi vajah ye mahaan cricketer hi hai
 From the resignation of Anil Kumble to becoming the coach of Ravi Shastri, everyone saw India's greatest players being dismissed
 dekhen koun kis tarah khaarij hua -1
 The Advisory Committee, adorned with Khawarschin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, had the authority to take any decision in the interest of cricket
 samiti ne hi pichley saal kumble ko coach ke rup main chunaa tha, lekin vahiin baad main bhi kumble ke kaarykaal ko badhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But such an atmosphere was created in the dressing room that Kumble had to resign
 2
 Anil Kumble dismisses Anil Kumble is one of the best bowlers in India, which is why he was made the coach of the Indian team
 apane ek saal ke kaarykaal main kumble ne bataur coach shandaar pradarshan bhi kiya, par kyonki captain or team ke khilaadiyon ko ek routine ko follow karne ko kaha jaataa tha yahi kaaran se unki captain se nahin bani
 And he was forced to resign
 kumble ne apane istife main bhi kaha tha ki shaayad team ko meraa tarika pasand nahin aayaa
 3
 virendra sahvaag bhi khaarijbharat ke mahaan openron main se ek virendra sahvaag ko salaahkaar samiti kii taraf se hi coach pad ke liye applai karne ko kaha gaya tha
 But because Captain Kohli wanted Shastri as the coach from the beginning, that is why Sehwag was not given attention
 intervyuu main kis aadhaar par sahvaag ko khaarij kiya gaya tha is par bhi koi saaf kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he
 4
 jahir-dravid bhi khaarijsalaahkaar samiti ne jahir khan or rahul dravid ko bataur gendbaaji or ballebaaji salaahkaar coach niyukt kiya tha
 But Shastri demanded the team of his choice from the BCCI and the BCCI also met him
 saaf he ki apane kariyar main 610 wicket lene vaale jahir khan par 6 wicket lene vaale bharat arun baari pad gaye
 And Rahul Dravid who shaped India's future is also shying away from entering this dressing room
 dravid ne kaha he ki vah team ke saath travel nahin kar paaenge lekin camp main jaakar unki sahaayta zarur karenge
 It is clear that Rahul Dravid, Zaheer Khan, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Anil Kumble have been one of the great players of Indian cricket
 agar kabhi bhi bharat kii dream team chunane kii baat aegi, to inke record or pradarshan ke aadhaar par ye sabhi khilaadi us team kaa hissaa zarur honge
 But perhaps the BCCI forgot all this in front of the insistence of a captain and coach

 In interrogation with the police, Rakesh confessed that he committed both murders to steal jewelry and money from Devakanya's house

 padhie un teen fiks overon kii har gend ko
 
 
 Sawai Man Singh Stadium of Jaipur and Pune vs Rajasthan match on 5 May
 pune kii team pehle ballebaaji karne vaali thi
 The match was going to start
 lekin match shuru hota usase pehle ek buki rajasthan ke spinner ajit chandelia ko phone karata he
 They both have conversations over the phone
 par donon ko hi pataa nahin tha ki ye baatcheet dilli police bhi sun rahi he
 Because both the phones had been put on surveillance by the police since April
 sauda tay ho chukaa tha
 The bookie himself was inside the ground, as Chandelia had to gesture before throwing the fix over, according to the deal
 ishaara apni tii-shart uthaa kar
 But it was possible that the camera would not have been on Chandelia when Chandelia pointed
 isiilie khud buki maidan main baitha tha
 So that he can see Chandelia's gesture with his eyes before the over starts
 taaki uske baad us over par satte kaa bhav kholaa ja sake
 
 aage badhane se pehle samajhen ki yahaan ek fiks over kaa matlab kya he? yahaan sauda chandelia ke ek over main kam se kam 14 ran dene kaa he
 If you give more than 14 runs, it does not matter
 par 14 ran se kam nahin hona chahie
 Now think, Bookie knows that Chandelia's no less than 14 runs in the over
 jaahir he ab jo satta lagegaa to lagane vaale ko to ye baat nahin pataa ki is over nen kitne ran banenge? yani uski haar tay he
 While the bookie is sure to be rich, because he already knows the result of the over before the start of the over
 khayr, sauda ho chukaa tha
 In the whole four million
 ek over yani chah gend phenkane or un chah gendon main 14 ran dene kaa sauda
 Chandelia throws the first over of the match
 ye over thikthak tha kyonki sauda chandelia ke duusare over ko lekar tha
 It was the third over of the match and Chandelia's second over
 chandelia kii pehali gend
 Outside legstump
 par ran ek hi bane
 Second ball, that too outside legstump
 robin uthppa ne usapar chaukaa jad diya
 Third ball
 of stump par thi short ball
 Easy ball again
 chauthi gend gudlength thi or kuch behatar
 No run
 iske baad paanchavin gend par ek ran
 Till now only ten runs were scored on five balls
 shart 14 ran kii he
 Chandelia b knew this
 lihaaja ye phenki chhathi gend
 Extremely bad ball on the leg side
 finch ne badi aasaani se usapar chaukaa maar diya
 The condition has been met
 chandelia apane duusare over main 14 ran de chukaa tha
 Prior to the match for this one over, Chandelia had received 20 lakh as advance out of 40 lakh
 par chandelia se ek galati ho gai thi
 Before starting the over, he forgot to sign the bookie by lifting his T-shirt according to the condition
 ab chunki usne sinal nahin diya lihaaja buki ne us over par satte kaa bhav kholaa hi nahin
 Because Bookie thought that Chandelia might have forgotten the deal or something went wrong
 lihaaza chandelia ko paise lautaane pade
 But this was the beginning
 ab baari agle match kii thi
 Of the next player
 agali deal bhi 40 lakh kii thi
 The first over was settled for 40 lakhs
 ab deal duusare over kii honi thi
 Deal again for 40 lakhs
 par is baar bowler badal gaya
 This time the deal was with Team India's former fast bowler s Sreesanth
 shrishanth ko apane duusare over main 14 ran dene the or wo 14 ran de rahaa he ye ishaara karne ke liye use apni pant main towel lagaana tha
 So that the bookie deal is confirmed
 padhie 40 lakh main bika hua shrishanth kaa ye doosraa over
 May 9, Mohali, Punjab vs Rajasthan - This time also the team was from Rajasthan
 par muqabla punjab se tha
 This time before the match, the bookie calls not Chandelia but former team India's fast bowler s Sreesanth
 pehali baar kii tarah hi is baar bhi bowler ke duusare over ko fiks karne kii deal hoti he
 This time too, there is a deal to loot at least 14 runs in an over
 is baar bhi over shuru hone se pehle bowler ko ishaara dene kaa hukum sunaaya jaataa he
 Bookie says two things
 pehali ye ki shrishanth apane duusare over kaa ishaara pant main towel lapet kar degaa or duusari ye ki over phenkane se pehle wo eksrasij vagairah kar thodaa time legaa taaki buki ko bhav kholane kaa vakt mil sake
 Sreesanth does the same
 pehla over wo bina towel ke karata he
 But after this comes the fourth over of the match
 yani srisanth kaa doosraa over
 The same over which is booked
 40 lakh main
 Sreesanth has to give 14 or more runs in this over
 saude ke tahat shrishanth doosraa over jab daalane aata he to pant main towel lataka kar
 That is, he had pointed to the bookie
 buki bhav khol chukaa tha
 Sreesanth fixes the first ball of the second over
 of stump ke baahar shot ball
 Sreesanth was given a chance but the batsman did not play properly
 isliye koi ran nahin ban paaya
 Second ball
 overpich
 Easy Ball
 chaar ran
 Third ball
 ye bhi of stump ke baahar
 But the batsman could not take advantage of this
 chauthi gend
 Getting up short
 par ballebaaz phir thik se pul nahin kar paaya
 Therefore, only one run was found in place of sixes or fours
 shrishanth apane bal noch rahaa he
 Fifth ball
 abaki leg said par
 wreck ball
 chaar ran
 So far, nine runs were scored on five balls
 chhathi gend par chaukaa
 The deal was for 14 runs
 par ran gaye 13
 Because despite the efforts of the batsman Sreesanth could not get the run
 par saude ke mutabik shrishanth ko 40 lakh phir bhi mili
 Because the bookie was done
 or iske saath hi ab kaam ho chukaa tha dilli police kaa
 But the police wanted the players to make some other mistake so that they could catch them easily
 or ittefaq se is match ke chah din baad yani 15 may ko ek tisare khilaadi ne dilli police ko ye mauka de hi diya
 The third deal was for 60 lakhs
 or khaas baat ye tha ki is baar ye deal khud ek khilaadi duusare khilaadi ke saath kar rahaa tha
 At the behest of the bookie
 to 80 lakh rupye main bike do over aapane dekhe
 Now it was the turn of the third for sale
 par ye teesraa over is baar 60 lakh main bika
 Actually, this third over also throws Ajit Chandelia
 magar match se ain pehle pataa chalaa ki chandelia team main nahin he
 Ankit Chauhan is playing in his place
 lihaaja is baar buki ne chandelia se ankit kii deal kii
 Now the third over of 60 lakh rupees was going to be thrown
 15 may, vankhede stadium, mumbai, mumbai banaam rajasthan- plaof main top tu posishan par rahane ke liye rajasthan or mumbai donon ke liye ye match behad ahm tha
 But Ajit Chandelia was not playing in this match
 uski jagah nae spinner ankit chouhan ko mauka mila tha
 Bookie also knew this
 lihaaja buki ne ajit chandelia ko apana mohara banaaya or use ankit chouhan kaa ek over fiks karne kii jimmedaari saunpi
 Chandelia deals with Ankit
 ankit maan gaya
 This time the deal was worth 60 lakhs in return for one over
 par ye 60 lakh chandelia or ankit donon main bantane the
 This time, the game was the same
 ankit ko apane duusare over main kam se kam 13 ran dene the
 And the same gesture was to be done before throwing the over
 ankit ne apana pehla over behad shandaar phenkaa tha
 Only two runs were given in that over
 ab baari thi match ke tisare over kii
 That means Ankit's second over
 vahi over jo bika hua he or jisamen kam se kam 13 ran lutaaney hai
 Ankit was the new player
 maudaan kaa bhi or is dhandhe kaa bhi
 So he was not patient with it
 pehali hi gend short daali or chah ram gaye

 com / ouox6khoqt After the water tanker and premium bus scam, the BJP has now been surrounded in the case of the irregularities in the purchase and installation of a high security number plate
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki hai security number plate lagane vaali company ne sarkaar ke logon ke saath milakar saadhe chaar sau karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa kiya he
 The company was not working according to the conditions, the company alleged that during the 49-day government, the Kejriwal government had come to know about the irregularities of Rosemerta, the company that installed the high security number plate, and the government then formed a fact finding committee
 is cameti kii report main bhi company ghatiya number plate saplaay karne kii doshi pai gai thi
 He was also found guilty of not working according to the terms of the agreement
 companiyon ko mili bazaar dar se paanch guni rakamayahi nahin cameti ne apni report main ye bhi likhaa tha ki company ne kaaron kii number plate ke liye 1200 rupee prati plate ke hisaab se charge kiya, jo tay daron se paanch guna tak zyada thi
 According to Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, the contract of the company was not canceled even after the report was exposed, but the Kejriwal government continued the contract even after coming to power for the second time
 450 karod rupee kaa ghotaladilli bijepi ke pravaktaa harish khurana ne kaha ki 15 maheene main 450 karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 This money either went in the pocket of the company or in the pocket of the people of the Aam Aadmi Party
 isaki jaanch honi chahie
 This is a scam, because the government not only knew about the disturbances, but it was also proved in the report of their own committee
 is maamle main dilli keparivahan mantri satyendra jainaka kahana he ki unhone haal hi main vibhaag sambhala he
 So they are not aware of the whole matter, but soon they will find out about it
 mantri bhale hi anjaan hai, lekin hamaare paas jo dilli sarkaar kii fact finding cameti kii report he, uske mutabik -- hai security number plate ke liye congress sarkaar ke dauraan 2012 main tender hua
 - In March 2012, m / s Rosemerta High Security Registration Plate Ventures Pvt Ltd got the job of installing high security number plates on trains
 - sarkaar ko is company ke khilaaf kai shikaayatein milin
 - During the 49-day government, the government made a fact finding committee regarding this contract
 - 31 janvari 2014 ko fact finding cameti ne apni report di
 According to this report - Concessionaire company was taking high security number plates from unproved and unverified sources
 - isaki vajah se is baat kii ashanka thi ki ye number plate ghatiya ho sakati thim
 Number plates were being installed from centers which were not approved by the Transport Department
 - number plate ke evaj main vaahan maalikon se overcharging kii ja rahi thi
 (up to Rs 1200 for car and Rs 600 for two wheelers
 jo teen se chah guna tak the
 ) - The committee received a letter from the Automotive Research Association of India on 15 January, according to which the conformity of production i
e
 COD certificate of Utsav Safety Systems Limited, a subsidiary of Rosemarta, was put on hold
 - fact finding cameti ne apni report main ye bhi likhaa ki uske paas expartise nahin hone or infrastracchar kii kami kii vajah se wo company kii kai takneekee khaamiyon kii jaanch nahin kar pai
 Therefore, it should be investigated by an expert committee
 ab bijepi sarkaar se sawaal kar rahi he ki,- fact finding cameti kii report ke baad company kacontract radd nahinkia gaya
 - Overcharging money not recovered
 jo 15 maheenon ke dauraan kareeb 450 karod rupee hua
 The company placed a plate of 200 rupees in 1200
 har maheene kareeb 3 lakh gadiyon par number plate lagaai jaati hai
 If we look at this accordingly, then in 15 months the figure reaches 450 crores
 ye paisa kiski jeb main gaya?- isi tarah kii gadabadiyon ke chalate madhyapradesh or sikkim kii sarkaar ne hai security number plate kaa kantract radd kar diya tha
 - The government says that it is in arbitration with the company, but should have gone after canceling the contract in arbitration
 jaahir he premium bas yojana main gadabadi or tanker ghotaale kii file dabaane kaa aarope jhel rahi kejariwal sarkaar ke liye vipaksh is mudde par bhi pareshaani khadi kar saktaa he

 Two things are understandable from the team that has been selected, the biggest thing is that captain Virat Kohli will play in all three formats
 jis bhartiya captain ke bare main kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah shaayad west indies ke daure par nahin jane vaale hai or thodaa aaraam karne vaale hai magar viraat ne in sabhi khabaron ko viraam dete hue na sirf west indies jane kaa faisla kiya balki teenon formet bhi khelenge
 After all, what were the reasons for Virat, due to which Virat had to take this decision
 sabase bada kaaran he vishwa cap main bharat kaa semifinal main haar janaa, jabaki vah cap kaa daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 The second reason is more than that, in the entire World Cup, Virat Kohli's bat did not yield a single century, only five half-centuries were made, while Rohit Sharma scored five centuries
 iske baad yadi viraat kohli west indies nahin jate to rohit sharma ko captain banaaya jaataa
 Anyway, one lobby in odis and T20 has been advocating Rohit Sharma to be captain for a long time
 bhale hi ye sabhi log mumbai cricket se jude hue hai magar unki baat main dam he
 Especially with T20 captaincy
 rohit kii captaini main mubani indian chaar baar ipel jeet chukaa he jabaki viraat kohli ke netritv main aaarasibi ek bhi baar champion nahin bani he
 Another argument is made that Virat Kohli wants to respond to his critics with the bat because he was not happy with his performance in the World Cup and the situation in the West Indies team, Virat does not want to miss this chance
 aakhir ve master blaster sachin tendulkar ke rirkad kaa bhi to peechha kar rahe hai
 All eyes will now be on Virat and Rohit's batting
 yah ek aisi pratispardhaa he jisamen sabhi kii dilchaspee rahegi
 The absence of Dhoni in the team going to the West Indies is also a big news
 chayankartaaon ne ek baat to saaf kar di he ki dhoni ko team se hataaya nahin gaya he balki unhone chuttee lee he cricket se kuch dinon ke liye
 But the biggest question is what is the way forward for Dhoni? It is certain that Dhoni will play T20 World Cup next year because if sources are to be believed, Virat has also talked to the selectors about this
 ab sabase bada sawaal he ki dhoni tab tak cricket khelte hue kitne kaamyaab hote hai
 After the West Indies, four T20 series are to be held in India continuously, with South Africa, Bangladesh, West Indies and Zimbabwe
 jabaki bharat paanch match kii ek tii-20 series newjiland ke saath uske ghar par hi khelegaa
 In such a situation, Dhoni will have to prove that he can be a part of the World Cup team in 12 domestic T20 matches
 darasal chayankarta dhoni ko unke ritayament ke liye dabaab na banaakar faisla unke upar hi chhod rahe hai jaisaa ki sachin tendulkar ke saath kiya gaya tha
 It is now up to Dhoni to decide whether he retires after the World Cup
 dhoni par chennai super king kaa bhi dabaab he ki ve 2020 tak tii-20 kii bhartiya team main bane rahen kyonki chennai super king ke saath unka 2020 tak kaa qaraar he or ipel main kiye gaye prardashan par kaaphi kuch nirbhar karegaa
 It is certain that Dhoni's height in Indian cricket is so great that no one can impose judgment on him, he will have to decide his career on his own
 is baar vanade or tii-20 kii team main chune gaye ek khilaadi kaa zikr jarur karnaa chaahunga, wo hai rajasthan ke navdeep saini
 Fast bowler Saini is the search for Gautam Gambhir who was called to throw the ball over the net
 150 kilometre kii raftaar se saini gend phenkate hai
 Virat is also in the eye of the Royal Challenger in the IPL, but the biggest story is that at one time Navdeep Saini used to go to play a Tenil Ball tournament in Karnal for just Rs 200
 do chachere bhai bhi team main hai deepak chahar or rahul chaahar
 Deepak is a swing bowler
 ek vanade or ek tii-20 bhi khel chuke hai or philhal chennai ke liye ipel khelte hai

 Let's see what our new stars feed in the coming days
 karnataka chunaav ke parinaam aane main kuch ghante bache hai
 Both Congress and BJP are claiming majority
 is bich mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kaa kahana he ki congress satta main bani rahegi or kaha ki yah unka antim chunaav he
 In fact, if the Congress manages to save power in Karnataka, then the party will try to show it by linking it with Rahul's strategy
 lekin punjab kii tarah jeet to party kii hogi lekin shrey amarinder kii tarahasiddharmayaco jayega
 For example, there was an attempt to link Congress's victory in the Punjab elections with Rahul Gandhi with all the arguments
 lekin raajnneeti ke tamaam jaankaron ne saaf shabdon main kah diya ki jeet bhale hi congress kii hui he lekin iskaa shrey keval or keval amarinder singh ko jaataa he, punjab ke logon ne amarinder ke liye vot kiya he
 Even in Karnataka Sonia Gandhi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Khargene held many rallies
 lekin karnataka main em siddharmaiya kii daavedaari ke peeche sarthak tark hai
 Only Siddaramaiah had his face in front of the people of Karnataka
 yahi nahin, un muddon par chunaav ladaa gaya jo pichley 5 saalon main siddharmaiya ne karnataka ke liye kiya
 If the Congress strategy is seen in the elections, it gave Siddaramaiah a free hand to a large extent
 lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kaa mudda ho yaa kannada asmita kii raajnneeti siddharmaiya ne har daanv apni ranneeti ke tahat chalaa
 He also left no stone unturned in making this election local versus external and he continued to attack PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah instead of getting entangled with bjp's CM candidate Yeddyurappa
 yahi nahin, vipaksh se mukaable ke liye bhi siddharmaiya akele maidan main date rahe
 In every election, Siddaramaiah was targeted by bjp's CM candidates BS Yeddyurappa and PM Modi
 siddharmaiya akele donon se chunavi reliyon ke saath-saath soshal media main jang ladate dikhe
 In order to compete with Siddaramaiah, the BJP also had to change its strategy several times in Karnataka
 aise main agar karnataka kii janata ne 'haath' ko vot diya he to unke saamne siddharmaiya kaa cheharaa he, or siddharmaiya bhi ye acchhee tarah se jaanate hai
 If after the election, the party gets coaxed, then Congress should give them credit or not, they will take it away in their own right
 kyonki karnataka kii janata unke saath he
 Significantly, the discussion on the name of Dalit CM in Karnataka Congress is in full swing
 khud siddharmaiya ne bhi kaha ki agar party kisi dalit ko siem banaati he to wo kursi chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai
 But at the same time, Siddaramaiah has also bet that this is his last election
 varisht makapa netaa seetaram yechuri ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki agar maovadi hinsa kaa rasta chhod loktantr ke tareeke apana len to unase baatcheet karne vaale pehle vyakti vah honge
 On Mamata's accusation of adopting double standards on the issue of Maoists on Yechury, who intervened talks with ultra-leftists in Nepal, he said that he started thinking about Nepali Maoists when they gave up violence and returned to the democratic path 
 samvaadadaataaon ko unhone bataaya, ‘isaki tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 The Nepalese Maoists gave up arms and took the democratic path
 iske baad hi maine unase baatcheet kii
 Yechury said, "let the Indian Maoists also leave the path of violence
 iske bina baatcheet kaa koi bindu nahin
 Let them leave the violence and i will be the first person to talk to them

 Some people feel that there is pain in the back due to lack of vitamin D, some feel that it is happening due to not sleeping properly
 vahiin peeth dard ke kuch pratishat marij kii isaki vajah calcium kii kami ko maan lete hai
 There is also a belief that working too much causes back pain
 peeth dard kii ye sabhi sambhavit vajahen hai
 Many times, back pain persists despite having stone problem, but recently a very interesting cause of back pain has been revealed
 ek holistic therepist sophia capse ke mutabik, peeth main dard kii vajah shaareerik hone se kahin adhik bhaavnaatmak hoti he
 According to Kapse, we have back pain since childhood and remain hidden but when we grow up it increases and then it becomes difficult to tolerate it
 capse iske liye ek kaaran yah bhi detii hai ki nakaaratmak vyavhaar yaa phir kisi nakaaratmak baat ke chalate hamaari mansapeshiyon main acid jam jaataa he
 It is responsible for pain
 capse kaa yah style kaaphi anokhaa he
 She works under Langellotti tri-therapy

 She then pressures and massages those places and tries to find out what is the reason for the muscle twitch
 is puure ilaaj ke peeche ek soch he
 According to the theory, when we go through a trauma our muscles get pushed

 This affects the sensory nerve and causes pain

 To be buried like a brave warrior? As soon as you take the oath of Chief Minister, by taking this terrible thought, she will hold the reins of new nationalist thoughts?

 BJP spokesperson MJ Akbar said on Sunday that the Union Minister had responded based on the police's statement and facts

 He said that Irani has put forth all the official facts
 mantri sirf police ke oficial acount ke aadhaar par hi bayaan de saktaa he
 Anyone can go and see his statement

 He has stated that Smriti's statement on Rohit Vemula caseusidenot was based on the statement of the police

 The General Budget is going to be presented in Parliament on Monday

 Irani in his speech had strongly targeted Rahul Gandhi and the Left parties on the issue of JNU and Hyderabad University
 unhone in dalon ko bachche kii maut par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Congress, JDU and Left will give notice of breach of privilege Major opposition Congress, CPM and JDU have accused Minister Smriti Irani of 'willfully misleading' Parliament
 congress netaa mukul vaasanic or pravaktaa shailaja ne aarope lagaaya ki ek dalit chaatr ke suicide maamle main jaanboojhkar sansad ko gumraah kiya gaya

 He said that the government has brought Congress motion on the lies that Rafale has lied in the Supreme Court but there was no discussion on that
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne supreme court main jo jhooth bolaa he usase unhone puure desh ko gumraah kiya he, isliye ham us sarkaar par koi vishwaas nahin karte
 Azad says that the same Kirafel issue was discussed in the Supreme Court at the CAG, after that it was discussed in the PAC and then it was placed in the House in the Lok Sabha and all this came in the public domain, but the truth is different
 Neither the matter came up in the CAG, nor was it discussed in the PC, there is no question of coming to the Lok Sabha
 aaazaad kaa kahana he ki yah itihaas main pehali baar he ki centre sarkaar ne supreme court main galat shapath patr dekar gumraah kiya or usee aadhaar par supreme court kaa faisla aayaa, isliye ham sarkaar ke khilaaf privillage moshan lekar aae hai or jepisi kii maang bhi jaruri ho jaati he

 Most of the opinion polls conducted earlier in the state polls show the ruling Congress and BJP as two strong contenders for power, while former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's party Janata Dal Secular (JDS) may play the role of kingmaker after the results

 However, since 1985, no party has come to power in Karnataka for the second time in a row
 us saal ramakrishna hegade kii aguwai main janata dal phir satta par kabiz hua tha
 The Congress is focused on the goal of retaining the only major state after Punjab, while the BJP is trying to form its government in Karnataka
 sabhi dalon ne kiya jeet kaa daawaabijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki karnataka party ke liye duusari baar dakshin main kadam rakhane kaa dwaar hoga

 Janata Dal Secular President HD Kumaraswamy has admitted that it is a question of life and death for his party

 On the other hand, the Congress is confident that it will break the trend of not coming to power continuously and Siddaramaiah said that his party will create history this time
 siddaramaiya ne twit kiya, ‘mujhase aksar kaha jaataa he kiitihaas mere khilaaf hekhyonki lambey samay se karnataka main koi sarkaar phir ye nahin chuni gai

 sattarudh aam aadmi party (aap) ke liye aaj kaa din sankatbhraa he kyonki chunaav ayog ne laabh pad ke maamle main uske 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraae jane kii sifarish raashtrapati ramnath kovind se kii he
 If Kovind accepts this recommendation, then the membership of 20 members from Delhi will be lost
 aise main 70 sadasyeey dilli vidhansabha main aap party ke vidhayakon kii sankhya 66 se ghatakar sidhe 46 par aa jaaegi
 MLA Kapil Sharma has been a rebel
 jabaki kumaar vishwaas rajyasabha main nahin bheje jane se naaraaz hai or bataaya jaataa he ki unke paas kareeb 10 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hai or mauka dekhte hue vah paala badal sakate hai
 If this happens, the crisis will continue on the Kejriwal government
 duusari ore, bhartiya janata party ke 4 vidhayak hai
 Assembly elections were held on February 7, 2015 in which the party won a historic victory under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal
 AAP kaa chunaav ayog par pakshpaat kaa aarope, vipaksh ne maanga kejariwal kaa istifahalanki aap party ne chunaav ayog kii sifarish ke baad hoicourt jane kaa elaan kiya he
 In the coming times, the political developments in Delhi are going to be very exciting, it has to be seen that where the politics here turns
 firaaq main hai bhaajapa-congress!duusari ore, raashtrapati agar is sifarish ko maan lete hai to 20 sadasyon kii sadsyta chali jaaegi, aisi sthiti main dilli main phir se chunaav kaa maahaul banegaa
 In the event of elections to these seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress may have a chance to improve their position in the Delhi Assembly
 lagaataar 15 saal tak shashan karne ke baad congress ko 2013 main karaari haar mili or 8 siton par simat gai thi
 Government in crisis due to rebellion! On his last working day before retiring on January 22, Chief Election Commissioner AK Jyoti recommended the membership of 20 members be dismissed
 aap party ise faisle ko court main le jaaegi, jabaki bhaajapa or congress chaahegi ki raashtrapati is par jald faisla len or sari sthiti puri tarah se saaf ho jaae
 On the other hand, the AAP party is very much worried about the rebellious attitude of its mlas
 party ke kai bade sadsy gujarey 3 saalon main saath chhod chuke hai yaa phir saath chhodane kii firaaq main hai
 Another problem facing Chief Minister Kejriwal is that he himself has removed his 4 ministers, seeing the opportunity, he too can join the rebellion
 4 hataae gaye mantriyon ke baghawat karne or 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta jane kii surat main bahumat kaa ankad ghatakar 42 tak aa jaaegi
 At the same time, Kumar Vishwas, who is angry with the party, is believed to have the support of about 10 mlas and he can change his position depending on the opportunity
 congress kii b team he aam aadmi party: manoj tiwariiske baad 2015 main phir chunaav hue to is baar congress apana khaataa bhi nahin khol saki
 Whereas the BJP, which was looking forward to return to power, could win only 3 seats
 baad main uske khate main ek or seat aa gai
 AAP MLA from Rajouri Garden seat Janrail Singh resigned from Punjab to contest the assembly elections
 phir upachunaav main ye seat bhaajapa ke paas chali gai
 The AAP failed in 2014, the BJP was hopeful that it would return to power in the December 4, 2013 election, but the hung assembly turned its hopes on
 31 seat hasil kar vah rajya main sheersh party banakar ubhari jarur, lekin 8 seat hasil karne vaali congress ne 28 seat jeetne vaali aap party ko apana samarthan de diya, jisase arvind kejariwal ne sarkaar bana lee
 However, this government could only run for 49 days as Kejriwal resigned after admitting his failure to pass the Jan Lokpal bill
 kaha yah gaya ki kejariwal dilli main mili chunavi kamyaabi se utsahit hokar 2014 main aam chunaav main badi jeet hasil karne kaa daav chalanaa chaah rahe the, lekin is baar wo naakaam rahe
 After waiting for almost a year, Delhi again saw the assembly elections (2015) and this time the AAP party won 67 out of 70 seats, defying all speculations
 bhaajapa or congress sirf mook darshak banakar rah gaye
 Kejriwal formed the government for the second time on his own with a bumper majority
 bade dalon ko nahin pachi aap kii yah jitarashtriya rajdhani main aap jaisi nai naveli party kii itani badi jeet kisi bhi rashtriya dal ko raas nahin ai
 From time to time, there were reports that big political parties should be in the process of toppling the government
 lekin halaat kabhi unke paksh main nahin gaye
 There was also a discussion in political circles that the opposition party wanted to topple the AAP government on the strength of rebel MLA Kapil Mishra, but it was not successful
 haalanki is bich aap sarkaar ne march 2015 main ek aisi galati kar di, jiskaa nuksaan party ko aage karnaa pad saktaa he
 The Kejriwal government appointed 21 mlas to the post of parliamentary secretary
 jisko lekar prashanth patel naam ke vakil ne laabh kaa pad bataakar raashtrapati ke paas shikaayat karte hue in vidhayakon kii sadsyta khatm karne kii maang kii thi
 Then from here the opposition parties got a chance to reduce the government's bumper majority to some extent by disqualifying the legislators on this pretext
 kareeb 3 saal puraane laabh kaa pad maamle main chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon ne ab tak ise taale rakhaa
 But the current Chief Election Commissioner AK Jyoti showed courage and considered it appropriate to take a decision on the matter before he retired
 sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main haar chuki he aapvahin dilli main hue sthaneey nikaayon main aap party kaa kharaab pradarshan bhi use khaasaa pareshaan kar rahaa he
 In the elections held in April last year, BJP got 64 seats in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation while AAP got 21 seats
 vahiin dakshin dilli nagar nigam main bhaajapa ko 70 or aap ko 16 siten mili jabaki congress 12 siton par simat gai
 The same situation happened in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation elections, where BJP won 47 seats, AAP 13 and Congress 3 seats
 aap party kii sarkaar rahete hue bhaajapa ne lagaataar teesri baar dilli nagar nikaay chunaav main bahumat hasil kii

 Lalit has claimed to have met Sushma in London with the help, while there are reports that the government may cancel Lalit Modi's passport

 Not only this, Chidambaram said that there are 16 cases against Lalit Modi
 maamle main britain or bharat sarkaar ke bich jo patrachaar hue hai, sarkaar ko un dastavejon ko sawarjanik karnaa chahie
 The former finance minister said that if the foreign minister helped Modi on the basis of humanity, she could also ask him to apply to the Indian High Commission
 sarkaar kii ore se lalit modi ko waapas bharat aane ke liye kyon nahin kaha gaya
 The government should ensure that Lalit Modi comes to India and then charges against him are investigated by the ED

 Under this, a Red Corner Notice will also be issued against him

 ED has convincing evidence: Sources in the ED say that the agency has strong evidence against Lalit Modi in a case of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and with the help of him Lalit Modi can be surrounded in British court too
 idi sutron ne bataaya ki ab tak lalit modi ke khilaaf sirf blue corner notice hi jari kiya gaya tha, kyonki ab tak unke khilaaf koi majboot saboot nahin tha, jise british court main pesh karne kii jarurat hogi
 But now the investigation of the case has gone much further and now the ED is ready to take this process forward

 Work done by rules: Britain: The UK says that in issuing travel documents to Lalit Modi living in London, the work was done appropriately and according to the rules

 The arrears of had gone up lekin tab aisa nahin hua
 Mallya challenged that decision in the Calcutta High Court

 gupta kehete hai, “aisa kaise hua ki bank keefee kii khaamiyon ko bhaanpane main ekadam naakaam rahe? yah airline company ek samay main bazaar hissedari or lod factor, donon hi maamalon main kaaphi acchhee chal rahi thi lekin uske baad vah ek bear company kii tarah kaam karne lagi
 "an airline company cannot function as aggressively like a beer company for which brand promotion and advertising are very important
 shaayad maalya ke dhandhe ko chaupat karne vaali sabase badi vajah air dekan kaa sauda tha jise unhone antarrashtriya udaanon ke license ke liye kharida tha
 According to Indian regulations, only those airlines that are allowed to operate flights abroad have completed five years in domestic services
 ise kam kiraye vaali kingfisher red kaa naam diya gaya
 Eventually, the airline was shut down in 2012 with a total loss of Rs 8,200 crore, and arrears of salaries and airports
 isi ke chalate maalya par ek aarope yah he ki unhone apni baaki companiyon kaa kaaphi dhan airline ke dhandhe main laga diya
 Auditors of Diageo, which took over a controlling stake in Mallya's United Spirits in 2014, found that Mallya allegedly owed him Rs 7,200 crore
 airline kii taraf mode die jo phir aage kisi or mad main daal die gaye
 Apart from this, the group company United Breweries was also allegedly valued at Rs 1,300 crore
 beimaani se idhar-udhar karne kii jaanch unke khilaaf chal rahi he
 There is also another allegation that Mallya was constantly nagging the system
 ek taraf to unki airline band ho rahi thi, unke staff ko vetan nahin mil rahaa tha or unki dendariyaan byaaj ke saath milakar 9,000 karod ru
 She had done it, but there was no difference in her euphoria
 ek samay maalya ko karj dene vaale lekin samay par samoochee rakam vasuul kar lene vaale ek sarkari bank ke purv chairman kaa sawaal tha, “aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki aap itani badi rakam ke dendar hon or khud aisi tadak-bhadak ke saath jivan bitaa rahe hon ki logon ko lage ki aap paisa uda rahe hai?”galati yakeenan bainkon kii bhi thi
 During the high growth phase of the economy, public sector banks were in a mood to continue lending
 ve badi pariyojnaon ko rin de rahe the lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main in vyavsaayon ke nafe-nuksaan kaa akalan hi nahin kar rahe the
 He had neither the will nor the will to evaluate all such projects
 natijatan kai karj duubate gaye
 One banker said, "there were very few organizations like SBI Caps or ICICI Bank that could go into the expansion of a project and assess its credit worthiness
" karj dene kaa kaam karj lene vaale kii saakh ke aadhaar par bahut kam hi kiya jaataa tha
 Anil Singhvi, chairman of corporate advisory firm Icon Investment Advisors, says, "if your growth rate has been very good for several years since 2006, it was because of the easy availability of such funds
" haalanki yah dhan “bankers” kaa nahin, “sahukaaron” kaa tha kyonki ve banker hote to yah bhi jaanate ki apane dhan kii vasuuli kaise kii jaati he
 Why is it that the NPA in the private sector is equal to zero? Do they not have pressure from outside? ”in this system, add the judicial system which is very strict on the retail borrowers but they allow the big corporate to go on holiday
 uparokt banker kaa kahana tha, “khudara karjadaaron ke maamle main to credit information beuro of india vyaktigat karjadaaron ke karj kii sthiti kaa puraa hisaab rakhata he or bainkon ko kisi vyakti kii saakh ke bare main pehle hi aagaah kar detaa he
 "flaws in the system raise serious questions
" kya aisa he ki bainkon ne maalikon kii taraf se kii ja rahi gadabadiyon par ankhen jaan-boojhkar band kar rakhi hai? kya aise vyavsaayiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne main ve jaan-boojhkar dhilaai barat rahe the? jab 2010 main maalya ne apni airline ko dhan uplabdh karaane ke liye karjadaaron ke ek samooh se charchaa shuru kii to bankeron kii is masale par raay banty hui thi
 However, it was decided by majority that Rs 1,500 crore from them
 vyaktigat guarantee lene ke baad nae sire se dhan uplabdh kara diya jaae
 The borrowers also obtained a list of their assets
 is tarah maalya ne kul 1,500 karod ru
 Described the value of shares, real estate, and other assets
 gupta kehete hai, “bankers ko us maukey par faisla lenaa tha or unhone faisla karj dene kaa kiya
 Now, it was a bad decision
 ” ab yah to nai jaanch se hi pataa chal paaegaa ki kya unhone kisi bahari dabaav main yah faisla kiya yaa bakaaedaar ke saath unki koi santhganth thi
 SBI has made it clear that it has used all available resources to repay the loan from KFA and there was no laxity on its part
 yah to khaas nahin!maalya bankeron ke saath kisi mileebhagat se saaf inkaar karte hai
 In a recent open letter, he stated that the KFA was initiated on the basis of an assessment of SBI Capital Markets and strong business plans of eminent international aviation consultants
 lekin tamaam prayaason ke baavjood aarthik vajahon or sarkari nitiyon ke kaaran vah naakaam rahaa
 He said, "the reality of financial pressure from Kingfisher Airline and external factors was made clear by SBI in a letter sent to the Reserve Bank on 31 January 2012
 ”unhone yah bhi kaha he ki ve koi akele bakaaedaar nahin hai or kisi bhi duusare bade bakaaedaar ke bare main koi khulaasa nahin kiya gaya he
 They said that they have challenged the decision of the banks in the court
 supreme court ne 16 farvari, 2016 ko bhartiya rigerv bank ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah chah hafte main silband lipaphe main un companiyon kaa vivaran uplabdh karaae jinhone 500 karod ru
 Has defaulted in repayment of debt of more than Rs
 in bakaaedaaron main bhushan steel, bharti shipyard, vinsom diamonds and jewelers or essar steel tak shaamil hai
 Total bad loans in the Indian banking system in the first half of the financial year from Rs 6 to 7 lakh crore
 mulya kaa bataaya jaataa he
 But unlike Mallya, all the other companies are protecting themselves
 mana jaataa he ki maalya ke liye unki vyaktigat guarantiyaan ghate kaa sauda rahi hai jinke bina unke liye dhan ugaahna mushkil tha lekin jinaki badaulat ab bank unke peeche ja sakate hai
 Some people say that the banks must have been kept in the loop that everything is right in Kingfisher
 maalya ne yah tay kar rakhaa tha ki unke nideshak mandal main bade va bharosemand log rahen-chaahe ve sebi ke purv pramukh ji

 kuch bank pehle hi padtaal ke daayre main hai
 The Enforcement Directorate says that IDBI Bank, which gave Rs 900 crore to KFA in the case of money laundering, did not relieve the mortgage held in exchange for the loan
 nideshaalay ke adhikariyon ko pataa chalaa he ki usamen se 300 karod kii rakam ko britain main le jaaya gaya or baaki 600 karod ru
 To the rest of the country
 iske liye maalya, keefee ke tatkaaleen vitt pramukh e
 Raghunathan and IDBI Bank officials passing the loan are under investigation
 kuch logon ne to rigerv bank kii is niti par hi sawaal uthaae hai ki jamaanat ke abhaav main kisi karj ko khaarij na kiya jaae
 Many are also raising the question of how Mallya Kingfisher brand gets Rs 3,500 crore
 ke liye rehan rakhane main kaamyaab ho gaye jabaki company kanoon is baat kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 Under the vision bond agreement between SBI and KFA on August 10, 2010, if KFA failed to repay the loan, SBI would have to get ownership of all the trademarks and credentials, including Fly Kingfisher, Flying Models, Fly the Good Times, Funliner and Kingfisher are included
 kansalting company thornton ne to 2009 main kingfisher trademark ko bhi 4,111 karod ru
 Price was judged
 lekin ab to uskaa mulya naganya he
 In such a situation, what are the chances of the banks returning the original money? 1,200 crore by selling shares and other securities held so far
 juta paae hai
 Apart from this, the Karnataka High Court has Rs 1,250 crore
 or jamaa hai
 In the year 2013, when some banks approached Mallya for the dues, that time Rs 6,493 crore
 mulya ke the, to maalya ne unase kaha tha ki iskaa kaaphi kuch diegio se saude ke baad chuktaa ho jayega kyonki british company united bruvarij holdings or usail kii baaki companiyon main 5,000 karod ru
 Was about to get shares of value
 yah sauda 2013 main ho to gaya lekin 2,400 karod ru
 At a very low value of
 phir jab bank is daleel ke saath court main chale gaye ki yah sauda us sahmati ke anuroop nahin he, to hycourt ne saude par roak laga di
 The case is now in the Supreme Court
 banking vyavastha kii taraf bhi kai ungliyaan uth rahi hai
 Banks should have declared the npas earlier and taxed earlier, they should not have restructured kfa's debt in 2010, when they raised Rs 1,355 crore
 ke karj ko keefee ke share ke bazaar mulya ke 61
 6 percent was converted into immunity at a premium and RBI should not have allowed such restructuring
 mani londering kii jaanch yaa kisi bhi aapraadhik maamle ke chalate bakaaedaar ko sajaa to ho sakati he lekin bainkon ke bakaae dhan kii vaapasi nahin ho sakati
 In the case of Kingfisher, banks may never recover their dues because the company has no assets left
 doosraa vikalp maalya kii nijee parisampattiyon ko vasuulne kaa ho saktaa he lekin usamen kanoonee adchane bhi hongi
 The Mallya episode is eye-opening for the government, regulators and the banking system
 lekin is baar bhi agar vyavastha kii safai nahin ho paati he, doshi log sajaa nahin pate hai or bakaae kii vasuuli nahin ho paati he to yah mahaj tantra ko parrast karne vaale ek or dhokheybaaj vyavsaayee kaa maamla banakar rah jayega

 shanti swaroop bhatnagar ke naam se diya jaataa he
 After the award distribution at Vigyan Bhawan, PM Modi said that Indian scientists have always contributed for the betterment of humanity
 vigyaan se jude hamaare sansthaanon ko bhavishya kii aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop apane aapako gadhana hoga
 PM Modi said, 'we have to mold ourselves according to the future society and economy while retaining our fundamental strength
 ab hamaare pharma sector or biotech sector ko zyada gati dene kaa samay aa gaya he
 Today, medicines made in India are being exported to more than 200 countries of the world
 'unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab ichha shakti ho to simit sansadhano main bhi kaise adbhut parinaam die ja sakate hai, iskaa udhaaharan hamaara spes program he
 He said that today India has become the fastest growing economy in the world

 Sanjay Raut gave reply on Sharad Pawar's CM, Sanjay Raut said - Sharad Pawar is a big leader of Delhi, the situation seems to be very complicated about whose government will be formed in Maharashtra and with the support of which party
 shivasena apni sahyogi bijepi ko tevar dikhaa rahi he to ensipi ke prati naram najar aa rahi he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut is saying that Shiv Sena is in touch with NCP
 haalanki, jab unase sawaal kiya gaya ki kya maharashtra ke agle mukhyamantri ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ho sakate hai to raut ne unhen dilli kaa netaa bataakar apana jawaab ghuma diya
 On the question of Sharad Pawar being CM, Sanjay Raut said, 'he (sharad Pawar) is a big leader of Delhi, why do you want to bring him here in Maharashtra
 ' saath hi sanjay raut ne ye bhi kaha ki meri sharad pavaar se baat hui he or duusari partiyaan bhi unke sampark main hai
 That is, Shiv Sena may be in a mood to revolt with BJP and form a government with the support of NCP or Congress, but Shiv Sena does not want to comprehend any kind of fight for the Chief Minister's fight with BJP

 On this occasion, Bollywood veteran actress Shabana Azmi said that the root of the problem is our patriarchal mindset, where once a boy is born he is made to realize that he is better than women
 aaj jab aurat azaadi kii baat karti he, khaas kism ke kapade pahenti he, yahi kaha jaataa he - 'vah 'yah' chaahati he'tippaniyan Politician Kalikesh Narayan Singh Dev said that our women colleagues have to work harder than us to reach Parliament

 Kalpana said, there is a difference between staring and looking
 purush ghurne ke liye mahilaon kii poshaakon ko dosha dete hai, or hamaare samaaj kaa maahaul kuch aisa he ki khud par sabhi prakaar ke niyantran mahilaon dwaara hi lagu kiye jane kii ummid kii jaati he
 Advocate, researcher and human rights and women's rights activist Vrinda Grover said that staring is a crime that is rarely reported, because no woman wants to get into the trouble of going to the police to report and then prove the crime 
 is avasar par bollywood kii diggaj abhinetri shabana aazmi ne kaha ki samasya kii jad hamaari pitru-sattatmak maansikta he, jahaan ladke ke paidaa hote hi use yah ehsaas dilaayaa jaataa he ki vah mahilaon se behatar he

 sutron kii maane to shiya vakf bordsupreme courtse maang karegaa ki mukhya maamle kii sunwaayee se pehle uski uski yachika par sunwaayee kii jaae
 In its petition, the Shia Waqf Board has challenged the decision given by the lower court on March 30, 1996, under which ownership of the land was given to the Sunni Waqf Board
 upi central shiya vakf board is babat kuch hindu sanghathanon ke sampark main he
 The board wants these organizations to support him during the hearing of this petition in the report
 shiya vaqf board ke sutron ke mutabik is yachika par court kaa faisla unke haq main aa jaataa he to mukhya maamle kii sunwaayee kii jarurat nahin hogi, kyonki wo vivaadit jameen par se apana malikana haq chhodane ke liye taiyaar he

 The Shia Waqf Board asserting its claim to the Babri Masjid also said that the Babri Masjid was built by demolishing the temple
 supreme court main daayar apni yachika main board ne kaha ki chunki isse sambandhit sabhi maamle supreme court main lambit hai
 He has therefore challenged the decision of the lower court directly in the court
 apni yachika main board ne yah kaha ki babari masjid mughal badshaah babar ne nahin balki unke sipahasaalar abdul mir baaki ne banavaai thi
 The board also says that Mir Baqi built it with the money of his own earnings
 mandir ko todakar babari masjid kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Since Mir was a rest of Shia Muslim, it is the property of Shia Waqf
 saikadon saal is masjid ke mutavalli yani castodian bhi shiya log hi rahe hai
 The petition said that the lower court's order was wrong in denying the Babri Masjid as the property of Shia Waqf
 ab bahes main ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki supreme court shiya board ke daawey ko kitni ahmiyat detaa he

 The second expansion in the Modi government's cabinet will take place before June 21
 kyonki 4 june ko pradhanmantri narendra modi videsh daure par ja rahe he
 PM will return late at night on 9 June
 or uske turant baad 12 june or 13 june ko bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarani kii baithak elahabaad main honi he
 Actually, the expansion in the Modi government and BJP President Amit Shah had to announce his new team last month, but due to elections in five states neither the cabinet nor Amit Shah could announce his new team
 chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar hoga vistaardarabal, piem modi or amit shah isliye bhi mantrimandal kaa vistaar or nai team kii ghoshnaa ek saath isliye bhi chaahate he kii party se sarkaar main or sarkaar se party main ek saath transfar posting kii jaae
 That too, keeping in mind the states where elections are due next year and based on the performance of ministers and party officials
 agle saal utar pradesh main chunaav hai or ye chunaav jeetna party ke liye har haal main jaruri he
 How many representatives of UP should be in the cabinet, the party is in deep consideration
 20 may kopiem modi, amit shah or vitt mantri arun jetali ne mantrimandal main vistaar or amit shah kii nai team ko lekar charchaa kii thi, lekin tab ye sahmati bani thi ki 26 may ko sarkaar ke 2 saal puure ho rahe he aise main sarkaar main chhedchhad karnaa thik nahin he
 This will not only send the wrong message among the public, but the opposition will also get a chance to attack the government

 In the government's development festival, 33 groups of all ministers and party officials have put together a duty
 jisamen sabhi group ko 6 rajyon main janaa he or ek din rajya main rahanaa anivaary he
 So the announcement of expansion in the cabinet and Amit Shah's team was put on hold for about a month
 27 may ko amit shah ne press conference main mantrimandal ke vistaar par kaha tha ki faisla hoga thodaa intjaar kiijie
 PM Modi and Amit Shah would consult the leaders of the Sangh once before expanding in the Cabinet and then forming a new team, as well as taking feedback from ministers to party officials

 In fact, a film titled "manto" has been made under the direction of Nandita on the life of the most popular and controversial writer-journalist Saadat Hasan Manto in his time
 navazuddin siddikine film main manto kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 For the film, Nandita read a lot of Manto's stories and her compositions
 film ke baad nandita ne "manto" kii manapsand 15 kahaniyon kaa sankalan taiyaar kiya he

 However, the controversy over the cover is starting even before the book arrives

 Which is Manto's poster only

 The publication group wrote in a long Facebook post, "the aim is to make Manto's literature and the film made on them to reach as many people as possible
 isliye kitaab kaa front cover film ke poster kaa hi kuch badla hua rup he
 The logo of the film's production house is also printed with the publication logo on the back cover of the book

 Lunar Eclipse 2019: The first lunar eclipse of 2019 is scheduled to happen on 21 January
 yah purna chandra grahan hoga
 The Moon that comes out on this day has been named 'super Blood Moon'
 darasal, grahan ke dauraan chandramaa laal rang kaa ho jayega or is dauraan chandramaa dharti ke behad kareeb hoga
 The total duration of this eclipse will be 3 hours 30 minutes
 haalanki, yah chandra grahan bharat main dikhaai nahin degaa
 Why this lunar eclipse is special - The lunar eclipse on January 20-21 will be the first and last full lunar eclipse of 2019
 iske baad purna chandra grahan 29 may 2021 main lagegaa
 Therefore, the importance of eclipse has also increased
 super chandra grahan kaa samay-21 janvari somvaar grahan armbh- subah 9 bajkar 4 minute
 Eclipse Middle - Ultimate Grass - 10 am 42 minutes
 grahan sparsh samaapt- subah 11 bajkar 13 minute

 kin-kin deshon se dekha ja sakegaa purna chandra grahan-21 janvari ko lagane vaala purna chandra grahan america, greenland, pashchimi africa, pashchimi europe aadi deshon main dikhaai degaa
 Why lunar eclipse and super blood moon occur? Full lunar eclipse occurs only when full moon occurs
 is dauraan surya ek taraf, chandramaa duusari taraf or prithvi bich main hoti he
 The direct light of the sun does not fall on the moon when it comes in the middle of the earth
 balki, surya kii roshni prithvi ke vayumandal ke kinare se hokar chandramaa par padati he, jisase chandramaa laal rang main dikhaai detaa he
 Due to the red color of the moon, it is called the blood moon
 is dauraan chandramaa dharti ke sabase zyada kareeb hota he
 Also, the moon looks much larger and brighter than its size
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke chunaav main deree, farvari main lagi muhardilli main farvari main vidhansabha chunaav kaa ho saktaa he elaandilli vidhansabha kii siyaasi bisaat bichaai ja rahi he
 Delhi assembly elections may be announced early next year
 vahiin, bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke chunaav se pehle 15 disambar tak rajyon main sanghathan ke chunaav kii dedline tay kii gai thi
 The election process of bjp's state organization has not been completed on this deadline
 aise main saaf he ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi kaa nayaa rashtriya adhyaksh milanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 The deadline for the election of state organizations of BJP has been exceeded, but the electoral process has not been completed yet
 isi kaa nateeja he ki ab bijepi ko agle saal farvari main kahin jaakar nayaa rashtriya adhyaksh milane kii sambhaavna he
 The president will be elected after a month-long organizational election process
 is dauraan kai rajyon main bhi party ke nae adhyaksh chune jaaenge
 a senior BJP leader said that in states where the presidents have been recently appointed, they are unlikely to be replaced
 haalanki kai rajya hai, jahaan abhi bhi pradesh adhyaksh ke naam par muhar nahin lagi he
 There are many states including Haryana, Himachal and Uttarakhand, where the name of BJP state president is still not stamped
 bataa den ki haal hi main bihar, rajasthan or karnataka main haal hi main nae adhyaksh banaae gaye hai
 At the same time, the process of appointing new presidents in other states will now start from January 15
 unhone kaha ki pradesh adhyakshon ke chunaav aam sahmati se hoga, jaisi ki party kii parampara he
 According to the bjp's constitution, more than half of the total state elections should be held before the election of the national president
 iske baad hi nae pradesh adhyaksh ke naam par muhar lag paaegi
 All these processes can pass for about two months
 isiilie mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi ke nae adhyaksh ke naam par farvari main muhar lag sakati he
 Meanwhile, the assembly elections in Delhi will be at its peak
 bataa den ki vidhansabha chunaavon ke chalate jharkhand main bijepi kaa sanghathanaatmak chunaav or dilli main philhal pradesh adhyaksh kaa chunaav nahin hona he, kyonki dilli main vidhansabha chunaav hone he
 That is why the election of the state president has been postponed in Jharkhand and Delhi

 mobile number veriphication ke liye aadhaar card jarurisupreme court main isse pehle bhi mobile number koadhar cardse anivaary rup se link karne ko chunauti dene vaali ek yachika daakhil hui thi
 Advocate Raghav Tankha has filed a fresh petition in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the telecom ministry's notification dated 16 August 2016 and 23 March 2017
 is notification se mantralay ne puraane mobile number ke veriphication ke liye or nayaa mobile number lene ke liye aadhaar card ko anivaary kar diya he
 The 'center misinterpreted the order of the court' The petition said that the Central Government had deliberately misinterpreted the order of the Supreme Court in the Lokniti Foundation case
 SC ke us aadesh par centre sarkaar ne kaha ki court ne aadesh diya he, puraane mobile number ke veriphication ke liye or nae mobile number lene ke liye aadhaar card ko anivaary kiya jaae, jabaki supreme court ne apane aadesh main aisa kuch nahin kaha tha
 The verification of the mobile number for national security says that in the case of Lokniti Foundation, the Supreme Court in its order had directed the Central Government to get the mobile number verified keeping in mind the national security
 jabaki centre sarkaar ne court main halafanama daayar kar kaha tha ki aadhaar card anirvaay nahin he
 However, the central government had also said that verification is easily done through Aadhaar card
 lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki aadhaar card ke jariye hi puraane mobile number kaa satyaapan or nayaa mobile number mil saktaa he

 There has been a war on Twitter between Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress Party's candidate for Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh
 arvind kejariwal ne amarinder singh par prachaar abhiyaan main drugs ke paise kaa istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya, jiske baad amarinder singh ne kaha ki kejariwal chizon ko aise apane tareeke se pesh kar rahe hai
 All these allegations are baseless
 itnaa hi nahin unhone kejariwal ko saarvajanik rup se bahes karne kii bhi chunauti di he
 This tweet by Kejriwal triggered a tweet war between the two leaders, in which Kejriwal alleged - Sir, the people of Punjab are talking that you are using the drugs of Vikram Singh Majithia in their campaign
 kya yah sahi he? aapane teen saal pehle unhen sibiai jaanch main bachaaya tha
 Sir, ppl talking in Punjab that u using Majithia's drug money in ur campaign

 ' unhone saath hi kejariwal se ye bhi kaha ki 'ab jabaki aapane apana munh kholaa hi he to mere saath khuli bahes kariye, jagah or vakt aap tay karen

 Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) October 24, 2016 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke pradhan sachiv or varisht iees afasar rajendra kumaar kii mushkilen badhati ja rahi hai
 a new case has been registered by the CBI against him
 sibiai kii team ne mangalvaar cockejariwal ke pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaarake daftar or ghar par chhapemari kii karrwai ko anjaam diya tha
 At the same time, more bottles of liquor were recovered at his house
 isi ko maddenjar rakhte hue unke khilaafabakaari act ke tahat ek nayaa mukademaadarj karaayaa gaya
 a case has already been registered against him on charges of corruption
 gauratlab he ki bharat main bhrashtachar kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane vaali transperency international ne is saal may main chitthee post karke dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko yah jaankaree di thi ki unke pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar buree tarah se bhrashtachar main lipt hai
 The copy of that letter from Transparency International was also sent to Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee and Chief Vigilance Commission
 bharat main itihaas kii sabase bada debit card frod kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 After this, six banks of the country have blocked about 32 lakh debit cards
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah mailaware vaale atm yuj karne kii vajah se aisa hua he
 Now it is natural to raise the question that atms and debit cards look like a mess
 kya sirf mailaware ke jariye hi isamen sendhamari kii ja sakati he
 It is not that there are many ways to hack ATM card
 jaaniye or kin tareekon se havers apane khatarnaak mansoobon ko anjaam dete hai
 Have you ever wondered what happens in an ATM machine? Almost all atms have the components below
 - oparating system- ATM units management system- yujar se interact karne ke liye khaas software- processing centre se communicket karne ke liye khaas software jo tranjaction kii jaruri jaankariyaan detaa he
 In addition to all these anti-virus software and control software, engineers keep Adobe Reader, Redmin, Team Viewer and other remote software in it for their convenience so that it can be fixed
 ye havers ke liye soft torget kii tarah kaam karte hai
 CCTV cameras installed in Visual collectionatm are not like common cameras
 ye camere bhi computers kii tarah internet protocol yani ypi adress ke jariye kaam karte hai
 Many times they are inter connected and sometimes they can be accessed from any corner of the country through IP
 esbiai yaa duusare bank ke atm main lageaipi camaron kaa accesbank ke paas hota he or iske footage sarwar par record hote hai
 Now it is not very difficult for hackers to hack IP camera
 camera hack karnaa yani wo ye dekh sakate hai koun sa shaks kab atm yuj kar rahaa he or khaas baat yah he ki yaheen se wo us shaks dwaara enter kiye gaye pin ke pattern ko bhi note karte rahete hai
 There have been many cases across the world through atms where no hardware has been found in the ATM machine
 ye kii logar kii shakl main hote hai jinhen havers atm mashin main aisi jagah rakhte hai jise kisi ko is baat kaa andaja nahin hota
 This leads to a clone of the black stripe made on it with the information of ATM and hackers can use it to blow money
 security wyk ke ek security research kaa daawa he ki kriminls ek yuasabi stick ke jariye atm se cash tak nikaal sakate hai
 There have been many cases where such incidents have been reported
 Tyupkin atake ke jariye bhi udaae jate hai card ditelskai aise maamle aise bhi dekhne ko mili hai jahaan havers speshlifed mailaware ke jariye bina card ke hi atm mashin se paise uda le gaye hai
 This is a backdoor also known as Tyupkin
 iske liye havers ko atm mashin kii zarurat hati he jisamen 32 bit vaala windos oparating system yuj hota he
 Most atms have machines in Windows XP By 2014, around 95 percent of ATM machines worldwide still use Windows XP as the operating system
 microsoft ne ab is oparating system kaa saport band kar diya he
 That is, security patches are not being given in it, due to which the threats have increased
 haalanki company ne atm network ke liye security ptch casilasilaa jari rakhaa tha
 Nevertheless, ATM experts believe that if all the banks fail to update the new version of Windows, then this may pose a threat to customers
 agar havers Windows XP kii nai khaamiyon pataa laga lete hai to lambey samay tak wo atm mashin ko torget kar sakate hai
 Attacks through Tyupkin are bootable cds that contain malware to attack Tyupkin
 is sidi ke jariye mashin main is khatarnaak script ko daalaa jaataa he
 The machine reboots once and then comes under the control of the Criminals
 iske baad ataikar ise control karte hue customers ke atm card ke data main sedh lagaataa he
 According to Tyrukin-affected country researchers, these programs were found in more than 50 b atms in Eastern Europe
 yah sabase pehle rus se aayaa or ab duusare deshon main bhi ise yuj kiya ja raah he
 It includes countries like America, China, Israel and France including India
 desh, duniya, mahanagar khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 The political drama released in Karnataka is not taking its name
 iskaa ant kab or kaise hoga, iske bare main andaja lagaana bhi mushkil he, kyonki guuruuvaar ko kumaraswami sarkaar ko vidhansabha main floor test clear karnaa tha, lekin dinabhar chale siyaasi drame ne number test kaa mauka hi nahin aane diya or vidhansabha kii kaarywahi ko shuukravaar subah 11 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 The BJP was sitting in the assembly thinking that the Kumaraswamy government would fall today, because the government did not really have the numbers, but voting on the trust vote was taken away for seven and a half hours and finally adjourned the proceedings instead of voting
 Gone
 iske baad to bijepi vidhayak vidhansabha main hi dharna dekar baith gaye
 They demand that they will not withdraw from the assembly until voting takes place
 bistar or khaane kaa intjaam vidhansabha main hi kar liya gaya or aaj kii raat bijepi ke vidhayak vidhansabha main hi guzaarenge
 BJP says that the vote of confidence was presented by the government, but for only 15 minutes the vote of confidence was discussed, the time of the rest of the day's proceedings was removed here and there
 ye sab isiilie kiya gaya kyonki congress or jedies ke paas vishwaas mat hasil karne laayak vidhayak nahin hai
 They just want to hang the trust vote
 is par voting nahin karwaanaa chaahate
 BJPBJP went to the Governor, had also gone to the Governor regarding this matter
 spikar ke paas rajyapal kaa massej bhi pahunchaa tha ki aaj kaarywahi khatm hone tak vishwaas mat par faisla kiya ja saktaa he, lekin rajyapal ke us sandesh ko spikar ne andekha kar diya or vishwaas mat par aaj hi voting karwaane ke bajaay aakhir main sadan kii kaarywahi sthagit kar di
 In view of the present situation in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, today the Legislative Assembly had 205 mlas in total, of which the majority figure is 103
 isamen bijepi ke paas 105 vidhayak hai, or congress-jedies apane sabhi vidhayakon ko milakar 100 tak hi pahunch rahe the
 Today, the number of mlas who have disappeared from the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly increased to 20, including 14 Congress mlas, 3 JDS mlas, 1 BSP MLA and 2 Independents
 congress or jedies is ummid main thi ki inamen se kuch vidhayak waapas laut aaen or unki sarkaar batch jaae, lekin baagi vidhayak waapas laute nahin
 Rather, two more Congress mlas disappeared
 yahi number game tha jisaki vajah se aaj subah 11 baje se lekar shaam saadhe chah baje tak yani kareeb saadhe saat ghante tak ek tarah se kumaraswami sarkaar samay katati rahi
 Kumaraswamy accused the BJP of discussing the motion of faith and the Congress and the JDS gave 26 names to the speaker, not two to four to give a speech
 vishwaas mat pesh karte hue kumaraswami ne kaha ki vipaksh ko aisi bhi kya jaldi he? aaj hi charchaa kyon khatm karnaa chahta he? congress vidhayak dal ke netaa siddharmaiya kaa number aayaa to wo vidhansabha kii kaarywahi ke niyam samajhane lage
 Siddaramaiah raised the case of the whip that if the proceeding on the confidence vote goes ahead, the whip will apply and if the whip is implemented then the rebel legislators will have to come to the assembly, then what will happen to the order of the Supreme Court? That is why the BJP started making noise Gave that Siddaramaiah is pulling his word deliberately
 ye congress or jedies ke netaaon kaa hatkandaa he, jisase wo vishwaas mat ko lekar der par der kiye ja rahe hai
 In this verbal battle, the time was up to half past one in the afternoon
 iske baad spikar ne lunch ke liye 3 baje tak kaarywahi sthagit kii
 Siddaramaiah's statement came in the middle that the trust vote should be postponed
 bijepi ke liye samay kaatna hua mushkilidhar congress or jedies time paas main juty rahi to bijepi ke liye time kaatna mushkil tha, kyonki wo to chaahate the ki vishwaas mat par turant voting ho
 Four hours later, nothing but speech was visible
 bijepi ne kah diya ki wo rajyapal se milane ja rahi he
 Meanwhile, Congress leader DK Shivakumar started showing photos of Congress MLA Shrikant Patil, who disappeared from the Congress camp yesterday and was found in a hospital in Mumbai this morning
 congress ne bijepi par aarope lagaaya ki wo unke vidhayak ko uthaakar le gai
 bjp's reply to this was that in the pain of going to power, leaders of Congress and JDS are talking such things
 dosha bijepi ko nahin mukhyamantri or grih mantri ko dena chahie jo vidhayakon ko bachaa nahin paa rahe
 In the midst of this verbal war, after lunch, the Assembly resumed at 3 pm, which was adjourned once again within an hour
 isi bich bijepi ke netaaon ne rajyapal se shikaayat kar di, jisamen kaha gaya ki rajyapal spikar ko bolen ki vishwaas mat par wo der naa lagaaein, kyonki siem ke paas bahumat nahin he or unhen aaj hi vishwaas mat hasil karnaa chahie
 When the Governor's letter reached the Speaker on the matter which decided on the vote of confidence, the Congress interrupted how the Governor can give directions to the Speaker
 is par spikar ne kah diya ki rajyapal ne nirdesh nahin die, balki ichha jataai he ki aaj kii kaarywahi puri hote hote vishwaas mat par voting kii ja sakati he
