 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav had about 90 minutes of talks in Lucknow today amid efforts for reconciliation after the Samajwadi Party was torn apart
 sutron ke mutabik mukhya muddon par donon pakshon ke ade hone ke kaaran koi sulah ke asaar nahin bane or baatcheet benatija rahi
 Earlier on Friday, both the parties submitted their claim before the Election Commission on the party's symbol 'bicycle'
 ab sulah kii khatm hoti ummiido ke bich donon pakshon kii ummiden chunaav ayog ke rukh par tiki hai
 However, according to sources, Akhilesh camp has also prepared for Plan B
 yani ki yadi unako cycle simbel nahin miltaa he yaa ayog is simbel ko fries kar donon pakshon ko nae simbel dene kaa faisla karata he to akhilesh yadav ayog se 'motorcycle' chunaav nishaan dene kii guzarish kar sakate hai
 The comments is sambandh main akhilesh yadav ke ek kareebi yuva netaa ne kaha, ''2012 ke chunaavon se pehle akhilesh ne apane abhiyaan ke dauraan saikadon kimi kii yatra kar party ke chunaav nishaan cycle ko phir se behad lokapriy banaaya
 Now if we do not get that mark, then we will request the Election Commission to give us a motorcycle
 iskaa gramin upi ke lihaaj se ek pratikatmak arth bhi hoga ki ab vikaas ke kaaryon ko tej gati di jaaegi
 '' vahiin duusari taraf mulaayam kheme kii taraf se shivpal yadav ne apane samarthakon ke saath ek meeting main kaha tha, ''ve log motorcycle ko lekar taiyaari kar rahe hai, mujhe is bare main pehle se hi pataa he
 
 
 Whatever they want to do, we are ready
 '' haalanki mulaayam kheme ne is masale par abhi chuppi saadh rakhi he ki yadi unako cycle simbel nahin mila yaa ayog ne ise fries kar diya yaa ise akhilesh yadav ko de diya to wo unke vikalp kya honge
 Now between the hopes of the end of the reconciliation, the hopes of both sides are dependent on the stand of the Election Commission
 haalanki sutron ke mutabik akhilesh kheme ne plan bi kii bhi taiyaari kar rakhi he
 That is, if they do not get the bicycle symbol or the commission decides to freeze the symbol and give new symbols to both the parties, then Akhilesh Yadav can ask the commission to give the 'motorcycle' election mark
 tippaniyan In this regard, a youth leader close to Akhilesh Yadav said, "before the 2012 elections, Akhilesh traveled hundreds of km during his campaign to popularize the party's election trail cycle again
 ab yadi hamako vah nishaan nahin miltaa he to ham chunaav ayog se motorcycle dene kii guzarish karenge
 It will also have a symbolic meaning in terms of rural UP that now the pace of development will be accelerated
 '' On the other hand, on behalf of the Mulayam camp, Shivpal Yadav said in a meeting with his supporters, "those people are preparing for motorcycles, i already know about this
 
 
 unako jo bhi karnaa he karen, ham taiyaar hai
 However, the Mulayam camp has kept quiet on the issue that if they do not get the cycle symbol or the commission freezes it or gives it to Akhilesh Yadav, what will be their options

 team india srilanka ke khilaaf pehla test haar chuki he
 The dramatic manner in which the Indian team almost sealed victory in the Gaul Test was really painful
 darasal yah mahaj ek haar nahin balki indian team ke liye ek aaine jaisaa he
 No one had thought that Team India, standing in the event of winning by an innings margin, would lose the match in this manner
 khayr, ek match to gaya haath se lekin ab batch ke rahanaa hoga
 The mistake that Team India made in Gaul will be avoided
 aaie jaanate hai ki captain viraat kohli ko galle kii kin galatiyon ko durust karne kii jarurat he:dosti yaari apni jagah, team kii jarurat apni jagahcricket kaa khel bhi kabhi kabhi shatranj kii tarah ho jaataa he
 If any one move goes wrong then the check is fixed
 cricket main sahi team kaa chayan haar or jeet ko nirdhaarit karne main behad ahm bhoomika nibhaati he
 Captain Virat Kohli has to understand whether the theory of 5 bowlers is right for the team or 4
 kyonki saurav ganguli se lekar emes dhoni tak hamane dekha he ki vah 4 gendbaaj, 6 ballebaaj or 1 wicketiper ke saath maidan main utre
 Are Rohit Sharma the right choice for key positions like number 3? Does Pujara not have a place in the team? Does India need a third spinner as Harbhajan Singh? Does Team India not need an all-rounder? Virat Kohli will have to think very seriously on all these questions
 kohli ke saath-saath khaastaur par ravi shastri ke liye salaah-baaten kam kaam zyadatim india ke diarector ravi shastri hameshaa kehete hai ki ham aakraamak cricket khilne main vishwaas karte hai
 Shastri ji, is it aggressive cricket that you went to chase 176 and lost the match by 63 runs? Should your opener (shikhar Dhawan) not score even one run after playing 35-40 balls on the fourth day, this is aggressive cricket? At one time you were in a position to defeat the opposition by an innings margin, but still you let them take the lead of 175 runs, is it aggressive cricket? The director has to understand that it is not a film that has come out after saying big things
 yahaan har kahi hui baat sach karke dikhaanaa hota he
 That's why things work less
 agar test match jeetna he to spinneron ko sahi se khelnaa siikhnaa hogasachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli, rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana ke sanyas ke baad ab tak koi bhi aisa khilaadi bharat ko nahin mila jo spinner ko bahut safai se khel saktaa ho
 Looking at the last few tours, the spinners became the biggest reason for the defeat of Team India
 had to tab ho gai jab england or australia jaisi jagahon par bhi ham spinneron kii vajah se test match haare
 In Australia, Nathan Lyon made us dance, and in England, we made Moin Ali a pure spinner
 yah sach he ki raaton raat is kami ko thik nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin jitna jaldi team india ke ballebaaj is khami ko dur kar paaenge utana hi unke liye phaayde kii baat hogi
 Captain Kohli will have to avoid being over-exploited, when India made a dent in Sri Lanka's second innings in the Test, the captain had to work a little more patiently
 dinesh chandimal, jehan mubarak or anya ballebaajon ko rokane ke liye kohli ke paas koi plan najar nahin aayaa
 The captain felt that 5-6 wickets fell and now the match is at hand
 chandimal jab tik kar khel rahe the tab bhi or aakraamak hue tab bhi, donon hi sthitiyon main kohli ke paas unako rokane ke liye koi upaay najar nahin aayaa
 Kohli will also have to develop Plan b and c as captain soon
 paristhitiyon ke hisaab se khud ko or team ko dhaalane kii jaruratemes dhoni takneekee rup se koi bahut sakasham khilaadi nahin hai
 But the biggest reason for the achievements he achieved in his career was that he always adapted himself and the team to the circumstances
 halaat ko sahi dhang se padhane or uske anukool khud ko dhaalane kii kshamta jitani jaldi kohli or baaki khilaadi seekhenge utana acha rahegaa
 In Malaysia, the Muslim commentator Zakir Naik's problems in racial commentary are increasing

 He informed that Zakir Naik has been called to Bukit Aman at 3 pm

 But in the midst of moments of intimacy, the practical Dhoni kept Ganguly away from limited-overs cricket and laid the foundation for building a young team
 ab 38 varshiya dhoni kaa bhavishya bhartiya cricket main anischitata ke daur main jhul rahaa he
 There is not much scope for emotion at the discussion table
 ganguli bhi dhoni ke bhavishya kii baat karte hue peshewar najariya dikhaate hai
 Talking to India Today, Ganguly said, 'every big player has to hang up his shoes (withdraw from the game), this is the game
 footbal ko dekho, maradona ko chhodana padaa
 There is no player bigger than that
 tendulkar, lara, breadman

 lekin bhavishya main kya ection hona he, road map kya hoga, ye chayan samiti ke haathon main he
 'dhoni, who was known as Mr
 Finisher on more than one occasion in the recent World Cup, failed to produce the results for which he has been known
 chaahe wo chej karte hue jeet dilaanaa ho yaa phir bharat ke pehle batting karte hue virdohi team ke liye bada target fiks karnaa
 Ganguly says, 'he is at the stage of his career where he has to evaluate where he stands
 unhen tay karnaa he ki kya wo ab bhi bharat ke liye match jeet sakate hai
 Can he contribute like any other player like MS Dhoni? kyonki jab emes dhoni, viraat kohli, sachin tendulkar jaise khilaadi jab tak khel rahe hote hai to har koi ummid karata he ki wo apni pahchaan ke mutabik hi khelenge or match ko jitaayenge
 i think it is for Dhoni to decide
 sirf ek khilaadi hi jaanata he ki uske tanks main abhi kitna eendhan bachaa he
 And how matchless is his match-winning ability
 ’lekin rishabh pant jis tarah chote formet main khel kii tricks sikh rahe hai or dhoni kii umr bad rahi he, usko dekhte hue ganguli kehete hai ki bhartiya cricket ko dhoni ke bina kii vaastaviktaa kaa aadi hona hoga
 Ganguly says, "indian cricket has to understand the fact that MS Dhoni cannot play forever and will not live together for long, and i think it is for Dhoni to take that decision

 In the india-australia series, everyone's eyes are on the pace battery of the visiting team
 sabhi ko intjaar hota he ki bhartiya spinners kangaroo team par haaavee honge yaa phir unke pesars mejabaan team par
 But Nathan Lyon's good performance in the last Test of the last series has raised expectations from him this time, which has led some to believe that the competition is between Ashwin and Lion
 2013 main jab australian team bharat ai tab line ne siries ke 4 test main 15 wicket liye, or aswin ne 29 khilaadiyon ko pavilion bheja tha
 Australia lost 4–0 in the Test series
 chaar saal baad test main 228 wicket le chuke line kii koshish hogi ki wo bharat main apana record behatar kar saken
 Also this time they are expecting better results for Australia as well
 australian spinner nathan line ne kaha, 'maine upmahadweep main khilne ke liye chaar saal pehle kaa apana najariya badal liya he
 Fans will have to wait till the start of the Test match to see it '

 Ashwin took 27 wickets in 3 Tests against New Zealand and 28 wickets in 5 Tests against the English team
 australian team aswin and company kaa khatra bhaanp rahi he
 This team has come to India with 4 specialist spinners
 bharat ai kangaroo team main anubhav ke maamle main nathan loyan sabase anbhavi spin gendbaaj hai
 Nathan himself is convinced of Ashwin and also intends to learn spin tricks from him
 line kehete hai, 'maine aswin kii gendbaaji ke videos dekhe hai
 He is a brilliant spinner and currently the best in the world
 main unase kaaphi kuch sikh kar bharat main uskaa istemaal kar saktaa hum
 ' aswin ke alaava virdohi team ko ravindra jadeja kii phiraki se bhi bada khatra he
 Jadeja has taken 14 wickets in 3 Tests against New Zealand and 26 wickets in 5 Tests against England
 india e ke khilaaf abhyaas match main loyan ne 4 wicket jatke lekin wo bharat main milane vaali kadi chunauti se waakif hai
 Lion has played 11 Tests in Asia countries in which he scored 42
 57 kii ausat se wicket liye hai
 'as a team we emphasize our preparations and not what the opposing team is doing
 ham jaanate hai hamaari team ek majboot team he
 Lion said after the practice session in Pune
 jaankaar maanate hai ki bharat or australia ke spinners ke bich bada faaslaa he
 Spinners like Nathan and Ashton Agar are also getting more thrilled with how effective the Test series will be compared to spinners like Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja
 'ek team ke taur par ham apni taiyaariyon par jor dete hai naa ki virdohi team kya kar rahi he
 We know our team is a strong team
 ' line ne pune main abhyaas seshan ke baad kaha
 Experts believe that there is a huge gap between the spinners of India and Australia

 The latest case is about Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana'
 soshal media par do tasveeron kaa ek kolaj viral ho rahaa he, jiske saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki 'saamana' ne apana mastahed (pehle panne par akhbaar kaa naam) bhagava se badal kar hare rang main karke 'secular' ho gaya he or akhbaar ne apni tagaline bhi badal lee he
 The Post claims that the change happened on the day Uddhav Thackeray took oath as Chief Minister
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki viral ho rahipostka daawa puri tarah galat he
 Neither the masthead of the face has changed nor has the tagline changed
 kya he daawafesbuk yujar 'rajendraprakash Saxena' ne 'saamana' ke do sanskarnon ke mastahed ko milakar banaai gai ek tasviir share kii he
 It can be seen in the picture that both these versions are from 22 November and 28 November respectively
 22 november vaala mastahed bhagava rang kaa he or uski tagaline he 'jwalanth hindutwcha puraskaar karanaare ekmev marathi dainik'
 It has a Hindi meaning, 'the only Marathi daily to raise burning issues of Hindutva'
 28 november ke mastahed kaa rang haraa he or isaki tagaline he, 'sarvadharm sambhawacha puraskaar karanaare ekmev marathi dainik'
 It means in Hindi, 'the only Marathi daily to raise issues of Sarva Dharma Sambhav'
 tasviir main dekha ja saktaa he ki is sanskaran kii taarikh ko haath se likhaa gaya he jabaki gaur se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki yah 18 november kaa sanskaran he
 In the post by Rajendraprakash Saxena, the caption reads, 'after the support of Congress and NCP, the encounter has become secular
 
 
 bhagava se haraa rang'
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 fasebuk par is post ko kaiyugersane share kiya he or whatsap par bhi yah post viral ho rahi he
 afwa's investigation, we encountered the Internet and found that its masthead is still in saffron color and the tagline is the same - 'the only Marathi daily to raise burning issues of Hindutva'
 hamane'saamana'ke archive se iskaa 28 november kaa sanskaran or 18 november kasanskarnanikala or paaya ki na to iskaa mastahed badla he, na hi tagaline
 'saamana' newspaper was founded by Bala Saheb Thackeray in 1988 to propagate his ideas
 AFWA ne 'saamana' ke kaaryakari sampadak or shivasena saansad sanjay raut se baat kii
 He told, 'there are some people who have a stomach ache how the government was formed and hence they are making fake pictures through photoshop and making them viral
 'is tarah spasht hua ki shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' kaa mastahed or tagaline pehle jaisaa hi he, bhale hi usne apane virodhiyon ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee ho

 Throughout the past week, my wife and i have been walking in the Warmia district of Poland, and we visited the battlefield of 'battle of Tannenberg' (battle of Tannenberg) on special dates - 26 to 30 August - when and where the year In 1914 there was an initial battle of the First World War between Russia and Germany
 german jeniyas won shliphane ne lagbhag do dashak pehle ek yuddh yojana taiyaar kii thi, taaki german sena yuddh shuru hone ke 33 din ke bheetar paris pahunch jaae
 It was expected that even if Russia went to war against Germany, it would take at least 30 days to get into a war situation, and by then Germany would have completely occupied France, and Will be ready to fight Russia with full force
 lekin sabhi ko hairaan karte hue rus ne apni taiyaari 15 din main hi nipta lee, or tab tak germany belgium or uttari france main hi atka hua tha
 The Russian plan was to send his first army under the leadership of General Renenkampf from the north of Varmia, to prevent German attempts to flee towards the Baltic Sea via the main Vietnamese port of Danzig
 iske baad renenkamp ko bain ore mudakar dakshin disha se aage bad rahi rus kii duusari sena, jiskaa netritv general samsonov kar rahe the, se jud janaa tha, taaki germanon ko dotarafa gheraa ja sake, or ve (german) vistula nadi kii ore pashchim main peeche bhi na hat saken
 The German army would have been in such a situation across the Russian River when they had stopped before the Vistula River, when they could reach Berlin in just a week, and once Berlin was captured, it could be negotiated in exchange for Paris
 Was, and the World War would have ended within six weeks
 yadi aisa ho paaya hota, to lagbhag dedh karod jaane batch jaatin, jo vishwayuddh ke vastav main varsh 1918 main khatm hone tak gayi
 And if the World War had ended in September, 1914 itself, it would not have actually been a World War, and therefore there would not have been a Second World War, and about 100 million lives would have been saved
 so, peeche mudakar dekhen to aaj 100 saal baad bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki tannenberg kaa yuddh kitna mahatvapurn tha
 However, barring 'what was expected to happen', let's talk about it, 'what actually happened'
 
 
 purvi morche par roosiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye pashchimi morche se hatane main naakaam rahi german sena, jiskaa netritv sabase naakaabil general won pritvitz kar rahe the, ne tay kiya ki ve prashia se hatakar vistula nadi ke pashchim main chale jaaenge, taaki nadi par yaa uske paar se roosiyon kaa muqabla kiya ja sake
 That is why Russia's first army, led by General Renenkamf, was surprised when they found miles of deserted villages, and there was no one to stop them
 parantu ek german kor commander general francoes, jo aagyaakaari nahin tha, prashia ko chhod dene kaa german haikaman kaa aadesh nahin maan paaya, or usne tay kiya ki vah peeche nahin hatega, or usne renenkamp ko gambinen main aamane-saamne bhidane kii chunauti de daali
 He was defeated on the right and the left, but through the cavalry (cavalry) of the Russian army, he destroyed
 iske baad general francoes us samay hairaan rah gaya, jab use apni jeet ko or shandaar banane ke liye protsaahit karne ke sthaan par peeche hatane or dur dakshin-pashchim main jaakar samsonov kii sena se muqabla karne kaa aadesh diya gaya
 General François was even more surprised when his counterpart Russian General Renenkamp broke contact, and did not attempt to surround the retreating German troops
 usee vakt, apane saahasvihin or kamazor commander ke netritv main haari hui roosi ghudsavaar sena chhitara gai, or bachi-khuchi sena roosi seemaa or uske paar bhaagane lagi
 The reality was that Renenkamf and Samsonov hated each other, and Samsonov also felt despised at the hands of General Zielinski, who had to maintain coordination between Renenkamf and Samsonov's forces from his rear base in Warsaw
 vaise, renenkamp or samsonov ke vipareet, jinhen yuddh kaa acha-khaasaa anubhav tha, zilinski ek chamachaa tha, jo kaabiliyat ke sthaan par krupa ke jariye pad par pahunchaa tha, thik usee tarah, jaise hamaare yahaan general bm kaul the, jinhen bharat-china yuddh kii shuruyaat main varsh 1962 main durbhaagyashaalee IV kor kaa commander niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Zielinski was wrongly promoted by Russian Foreign Minister Sukhomlinov, just as Kaul was wrongly promoted by VK Krishna Menon
 or vaise donon kii tarakkee kaa kaaran bhi lagbhag ek jaisaa tha - zilinski darasal rasputin ke jariye zaarina (roosi rani) kaa kareebi mana jaataa tha, or thik usee tarah kaul ko tinmurti bhawan se judaa samajha jaataa tha
 After this, instead of chasing down the fleeing Germans and not removing the commander of the fleeing cavalry, the commander of the First Army, Renenkampf, asked him to march west and join the other army
 Zieliस्कीski ordered the commander of the second army, Samsonov, to move towards Vistula, while he did not have enough logistics, so the German army of the Russian army resulted The surrounding grab both the plan was very good on paper, did not take as fact never tangible
 is dauraan, germanon ne apane bekaar sabit hue commander ko hataakar hindenberg or ludendorf kii jodi ko laane kaa faisla kiya - jo germany ke sainya itihaas kii sabase mashhoor commander jodi bane - or unhen pashchimi morche se purvi morche kii ore bheji gayi do tukadiyon se majbootee milani thi
 But even then, this illustrious pair could not succeed if the stubborn mind of Commander General François, who won a partial victory at Gambinen, did not contribute
 usne zid kii ki jab tak uski baari gola-barood vaali tukdi nahin pahunch jaati, hamalaa nahin kiya jaae
 (I recall John Dalvi posted in Brigadier namka-chu, because if he too would have refused to obey the senseless orders he received from the Army Headquarters to attack, he would be considered the beginning of the 1962 war
 Would have survived the disgrace of the post-destruction
 ) Hindenburg and Ludendorff went to the base of François himself, and ordered him to attack before his plan, but despite this, François remained adamant
 use usee shaam aadesh na maanane ke liye barkhaast kar diya jaataa, agar roosiyon ke do khaas sandesh pakad main na aae hote, jinhone yuddh kii tasviir hi badal daali
 As the Russians were not broadcasting their message codes in the language, the Germans received copies of Russian orders from a local telegraph office, which showed that Renenkampf decided not to join Samsonov's army, and those messages included Samsonov The exact position of the army the next day was also given (just like the Indian peacekeeping force in Sri Lanka was sent without using code language)
 Information foray of their paratroopers from countries in the Jaffna University were sitting Prabhakaran, and consequently were made victims in the sky)
 so, jab agle din francoes ne apane gola-barood ke saath morcha kholaa, samsonov kii duusari sena puri tarah nestnabud ho gai, or sirf ek roosi commander - general martos - bachaa, jisane francoes ke morche se kuch hi mile uttar main hohensten main apane german samakaksh ko buree tarah haraa daalaa, lekin us abhiyaan main usne 4,000 faujee or apane adhiktar afasar kho die, bilkul usee tarah, jaise brigadier hoshiyaar singh ne sela main baari chini fouj ke saamne ganvaae the
 In the meantime, instead of Samsonov coming to the rescue, Renenkampf, according to the original plan, sent only one regiment to Samsonov, who despite fighting valiantly at Duraten, trampled between the two lakes
 or iske baad samsonov ke paas sharminda hokar peeche hatane ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa tha
 This led to a nervous breakdown (remember, Kaul was sick in Tawang too?) And then shot himself by reaching the edge of the forest near the Russian border to avoid the shame of carrying the news of defeat to the Tsar
 Lee
 vah aakhri shikaar tha, us abhootpurv or stabdh kar dene vaali haar kaa, jiske baad 10 karod or jaanon kaa janaa tay ho gaya
 In my mind, the memories of a meeting in India International Center are refreshed in 1983, when the Sri Lankan crisis had just begun, where a very senior general of the Indian Army, whose tone was completely British, insisted , If our government allows, they will rip Sri Lanka in the same way as a knife to rip butter
 ham jaanate hi hai, uske baad kya hua tha
 The battle of Tannenberg clearly shows that there is a shadow between human plans and destiny, which cannot be seen before
 so, agar ham badi-badi muchhen tanakar tivi par bolne vaale ritair ho chuke phogiyon kii sunne lagen, to dakshin asia khud ko is 21veen shatabdi main bhi vaise hi halaat main paaegaa, jo 20veen shatabdi main the, or jinaki vajah se karodon jaane gayi

 In the second match of the three-day ODI series between India and Bangladesh, the Indian team will take on the host team at the Shere Bangla Stadium in Dhaka today
 pehle match main mili haar se tilamilaai team india is match main jabardast palatwaar karne ke mood main he
 The batsmen will have to show that the Indian batting order, which is seen heavily on the flamboyants, is expected to look heavy on the ground today, or else the Bangladesh team will not take any time to make another upset
 vahiin duusari taraf bhartiya gendbaajon par bangladeshi batsmanon ko bada score karne se rokane kii jimmdari hogi
 The Indian openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are expected to start the team well again, while the middle order, who missed the last match, will have to score as much as they can to understand their responsibility
 dhoni ke saath hi raina or rahane kii form bhi jaruribhartiya team ke liye jahaan duniya ke best finishars main se ek mahendra singh dhoni kii form main vaapasi jaruri he vahiin saath hi van-de maichon main bhartiya middle order ke aadhaar stambh ajinkya rahane kii test jaisi form bhi jaruri he
 If we talk about Raina, it is very important for the team to have a match winner player like Raina because, if Raina comes out, it becomes very easy for the team to hang or chase any target on the board
 dhaval ko milanaa chahie maukaawahin duusari taraf agar ham gendbaajon kii baat karen to mohit sharma ne pichley match main 5 overon se bhi kam gendbaaji kii thi jisamen unhone 10 chauke khaae the
 So at the same time Umesh Yadav also gave away more than 7 runs per over
 is match ke liye agar dhoni chahen to inaki jagah dhaval kulkarni or stuart binni ko mauka de sakate hai
 The team will also have to avoid situations like the push-and-fight between Dhoni and Mustafizur Rahman in the last match, as Rohit Sharma said in the press conference, 'india has a lot to lose'
 Bowler On the other hand, if we talk about the Bangladeshi team, then the bowling of the team led by Mustafizur Rahman, who debuted from the last match, performed tremendous Is
 pehle match main jis tarah se unhone bharat ke majboot ballebaaji kram ko saste main nipta diya or apane pehle hi match main 5 wicket le liye use dekhte hue is match main bhi bharat kaa rasta kathin hi dikh rahaa he
 The rest of Bangladesh's bowlers also supported Rahman well
 bangladesh kii batting bhi he shandarajabaki agar ballebaaji kii baat karen to bangladeshi ballebaajon ne bhartiya gendbaajon kii khub pariksha lee or board par 300 se bhi zyada ran taang die
 It was the performance of the batsmen that was bowled over by the bowlers
 lekin pehle match main hui controvarsi ke baad mustafijur ko aisi baton se bachanaa chahie kyonki abhi wo apane kariyar ke shuruaati daur main hai or unhen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki wo bangladesh ke liye khelte hai naa ki australia ke liye or jab aap bangla sheron ke liye khelen to aapkaa atitude kangaaroon jaisaa nahin hona chahie
 This is very harmful for career

 Former NC minister Khalid Najeeb Sohrawardy, who hails from Chenab Valley, alleges that the BJP is trying to instill fear among the Hindus of Jammu
 unka kahana he ki chenab ko swaittata dene se us kshetra kaa vikaas hoga

 2013 main hasi ke saath unhone duusare wicket ke liye 140 ran jode the jo aaj bhi is wicket ke liye chennai kaa record he
 That is, if we say that Suresh Raina is the Sachin Tendulkar of IPL, then it will not be an exaggeration

 According to the ICC statement, if the Sri Lankan team loses in Palekele, the table can be changed twice
 isisi vishwa twanti-20 ke final main pahunchane vaali srilankai team isisi tii-20 antarrashtriya championships talika main number ek ranking team ke taur par shuruyaat karegi, jabaki isisi vishwa tii-20 super aath charan main super over main do match ganvaane vaali newjiland kii team aathven sthaan se shuruyaat karegi
 a win by Sri Lanka will ensure that he finishes the year as the number one team in the T20 rankings, but if he loses, the ICC World T20 champions will be included in the ICC Championship table, first launched in 2011
 The West Indies can snatch her number one position
 srilankai team ke newjiland se haarane se angelo maithyuj kii team chah reating ank ganvaa degi or derren saimi kii team ke saath 121 reating ank par pahunch jaaegi
 The comments iskaa matlab he ki agar westeindies kii team 10 disambar ko dhaka main bangladesh ko haraa detii he, to carabian team apane isisi vishwa khitaab main number ek ranking bhi jod degi
 However, it will remain in the top order for a short time as the Indian team can beat the West Indies if they beat England in the Twenty20 Internationals to be held in Pune and Mumbai on December 20 and 22 respectively

 With the Sri Lankan team losing to New Zealand, Angelo Mathews' team will lose six ratings points and move to 121 ratings points with Darren Sammy's team
 tippaniyan This means that if the West Indies team defeats Bangladesh in Dhaka on 10 December, the Caribbean team will also add the number one ranking to their ICC world title
 isse haalanki sheersh kram main vah thode samay tak hi rahegi, kyonki bhartiya team agar england ko 20 or 22 disambar ko kramash: pune or mumbai main hone vaale twanti-20 antarrashtriya maichon main haraa degi, to vah west indies ko pachhad sakati he
 If India beat England 2-0, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will get seven rating points and the team will reach 127 rating points and will be five points above the West Indies
 bhartiya team agar 1-1 se baraabar rahati he, to is parinaam se bharat or england shrunkhlaa se pehle ke reating ank barkaraar rakhenge

 Just a day after the attack on security forces in Kashmir, suspected militants launched a grenade attack targeting a police vehicle in a crowded busy market in Anantnag district, injuring five civilians
 police ke ek pravaktaa ne bataaya ki agyaat aatankwaadiyon ne yahaan se 45 kilometre dur srinagar-jammu rajmarg par bijabehaara shahar ke gorivaan bazaar main dopaher ek bajkar chalis minute main grenade phenkaa
 He said the grenade exploded outside a shop, injuring five civilians
 aadhikarik sutron kaa kahana he ki sambhavat: vahaan se guzar rahe police ke ek vaahan ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha, lekin nishaanaa sateek nahin baitha
 The grenade attack comes just after a series of attacks targeting security forces in Srinagar and Shopian district of south Kashmir on the previous day
 is ghatana kii kisi bhi aatankwaadi sanghathan ne ab tak jimmedaari nahin lee he
 This incident has created fear among the people of this city located on the side of the highway
 sutron ke mutabik, police ne ardhsainik balon kii madad se shidhra hi ghatnasthal ke aasapaas ke ilaake kii gheraabandi kar di, lekin ab tak kisi ko giraftaar nahin kiya ja sakaa he

 whatsapp ne bharat ke liye fact check sarvice kaa elaan kiya he
 However, it cannot be called whatsapp's service, as it has been commissioned by whatsapp as a research project
 ye ek tipline he or is number par fact check ke liye contant bhej sakate hai
 For this, the company partnered with a local startup named Proto and released a number
 is number par massej karke aap khabaron ko veriphai kar sakate hai
 But i tried it and there is no fact check for more than 24 hours
 kai logon ne tri kiya, sirf auto riplai miltaa he
 According to whatsapp, it is not a service of whatsapp nor is it a feature of whatsapp
 proto or duusare local starop ke saath watsap ne partnership kii he jo fact check karte hai
 This number is not whatsapp's own, but Proto's
 agar aap ye samaj rahe hai ki ye watsap kii sarvice he or watsap ne bharat main fact check sarvice launch kii he to aap galat hai
 whatsapp has more than 200 million users in India
 aise main is tarah kii fact check sarvice asambhav lagati he
 India is the first country where whatsapp has taken this step
 iskaa makasad phek news ko rokna he
 This company named Proto does Artificial Intelligence for Fact Check or it is verified by people, it is secret
 fasebuk ne apane plateform par fact check karne ke liye kai companiyon ke saath pehle se partnership kii he, lekin phir bhi iskaa asar fasebuk par nahin dikhataa he
 It is possible that whatsapp has found this way to avoid the constant pressure of the government
 sarkaar kaaphi pehle se ye maang kar rahi he ki phek news bhejne vaale ke origin kaa pataa lagane ke liye company ek tul develop kare
 whatsapp has clearly stated that this cannot happen, because whatsapp is a platform with end to end encryption
 aam chunaav bhi aane vaale hai, aise main watsap ne ek third party fact check agency ke saath mil kar ek number jari kiya he
 Perhaps this will reduce the pressure of the government on whatsapp
 bhale hi fact check ho yaa na ho
 whatsapp has said in a statement that the company is working with a local startup named Proto
 iske tahat yugers ko unke request par ye bataaya jayega ki khabar tru he, falls he, misliding yaa yaa disputed he

 Later, the parents learned that he did not even go to school and became addicted to the game
 or iske liye use daant bhi lagaai gai
 The minor's father works in a private firm in Thane while the mother works in a firm in Navi Mumbai
 kishor ke pune jane kii sambhaavnanvi mumbai police kii sibar cell ne pabaji acount idi check kiya to pataa chalaa ki vah game top level par pahunch gaya tha
 After questioning some of his friends, the police found that a friend made through PUBG game offered him a job in a cyber cafe in Pune where he would have a chance to play PUBG game without any hindrance
 police ko shaq he ki vah pune gaya hoga, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki usne pabaji idi badal diya hoga or ek nae idi ke saath game khel rahaa hoga
 a team from the crime branch of Navi Mumbai is in Pune and is investigating all the big cyber cafes to find the child working there, but no positive results have been found so far
 yahaan tak kii servilans ke jariye bhi najar banaai ja rahi he ki agar koi baccha online pabaji game kheltaa he to uskaa lokation pataa chal jaae

 He later died while being taken to the hospital

 The impact of Modi wave in Benaras is like froth created at the time of plunge

 This Ganga also knows that there is talk of a wave in the whole country, keeping it at the center
 lekin uski laharon kii nahin
 Someone else's wave, which has come to Benares
 ganga ke dariyaa main utana pani nahin he ki dubo dene vaali lehren paidaa ho sake
 Ganga and Banaras are immersed in a strange kashmaksh
 is shahar kii pahchaan hi mandir, math, ghant or mahanton se he or bhartiya raajnneeti main mandir kii entry bahut pehle hi ho chuki he
 This is the reason that after 92, the mayors, councilors, mlas and mps in Benaras have mostly remained of the BJP
 aise main modi ko adwantage he duusare dalon ke mukaable
 Bharat Lal, an auto driver by profession, says Modi is different from other leaders, so we will vote for him
 haalanki pichhlaa saansad bekaar niklaa
 Generally, Benares has been identified as a city with harmony and ganga-jamuni teejib
 lekin yahaan kii satta par bijepi kaa kabja lambey samay se he
 In response to this question, Professor Raman Pant of the Department of Statistics at Kashi Vidyapeeth says why Hindutva will be immersed in Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb
 secular or buddhijivi log ganga jameen tahjeeb ko jagaae rakhte hai
 He says that minority politics has been accepted in this country

 There is no need to gather a crowd to gather in Modi or BJP rallies
 vah swatah aati he or jute jaati he
 He does not mind whether he shook hands with Modi or not
 unka yaheen kahana he ki modi aae gujarat kii tarah desh kaa vikaas hoga
 The whole of Benaras has been bridged with Modi-centric posters
 kuccha kii kaseedakaari or gujarat ort fere ke poster bhi dikhne lage hai
 Perhaps this is a glimpse of the coming development
 bijepi ke mukaable kejariwal ko apni raily organij kerani padati he
 This shows that Kejriwal is lagging behind in the matter of local support
 haalanki muslimon kii ek sankhya kejariwal kii reliyon main dikhti he
 Bharat Lal, an auto driver, says that the competition here is between Kejriwal and Modi
 ajay raay to vot ke maamle main baccha he
 Both mafia have been found and will begin recovery after winning
 banaras kii janata ab samaj gai he
 Ajay Rai and Mukhtar Ansarika joining hands can give Kejriwal an edge
 jis tarah hindu voter mukhtaar ko pasand nahin karte hai thik usee tarah muslim voter bhi ajay raay ko
 In such a situation, Muslim votes can be broken and go to Kejriwal's court
 kejariwal ke road sho main muslimon kii bheed is factor kii ore ishaara karti he
 But there is also a screw in this, the last time the votes of Shia Muslims went to BJP
 jiske dam par joshi jeet hasil kar sake
 This time also Shia votes can go to BJP
 kalbe javwaad or bijepi kaa rishta pehle se hi madhur dikh rahaa he
 a major problem facing Kejriwal is the local support
 modi ke mukaable unhen sthaneey kamjor dikh rahaa he
 Outside the city, however, their people remain in reach
 lekin wo vot main kitna tabdeel ho paaenge ye koi nahin kah rahaa he
 However, the students of IIT BHU are busy in full support in support of Kejriwal
 shahar ke bahargaanv or bastiyon main sapa or basapa kaa jor he
 His vote hardly goes back and forth
 purvanchal main ek kahawat he basapa waalon ko kitna bhi samajhaaoge
 He sees nothing in front of the elephant
 rahi baat congress kii to rahul gandhi kitna bhi jor laga len, purvanchal main mafia raaj ek bada factor he jo unke khilaaf hi jayega
 Modi and his team have come from Banaras from Gujarat
 aisa nahin he
 Organizations like All India Tribal movement-gujarat and Adivasi One Jan Shramjeevi Union have been active in Banaras for the past one month under the banner of Shared Sanskriti Manch and Sangharsh 2014 which are warning people to choose the 'right' candidates
 inhen logon main se ek bhargavi kahati he ki har gaanv main ek dalit basti he yahaan
 But most people have not even heard of Modi's name
 ve kehete hai ham to sthaneey ummidavaar ko vot karenge
 Mercury is climbing rapidly in Purvanchal including Banaras
 chunavi sargarmi aakhri charan main he or sabhi partiyon ne puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 But the people of Benaras are still fathom
 kuch log modi or kejariwal kaa naam le rahe hai
 But the bet is not open yet
 modi samarthak se pucho to kehete hai ki kejariwal dilli chhodkar bhaag gaye ye desh kya chalaayenge
 
 lekin is baat ko maanate hai ki modi ko takkar dene koi aayaa he or muqabla fansaa hua he

 Recently you saw the news that Parle, the world's largest selling biscuit maker, can lay off its 10,000 employees
 company kii daleel he ki market main demand kam hone ke chalate uskaa maal kam bik rahaa he
 We tried to know why a biscuit like Parleji is not being sold
 We reached Sahibabad Industrial Area
 sahibabad industrial aria dilli kii seemaa se sate uttar pradesh kaa ek bada audyogic kshetra he
 There are about 10,000 factories employing around 2
5 lakh laborers
 majdoor varg main parle-ji khaasaa lokapriy mana jaataa he, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki is biscuit main glucose kii maatra zyada hoti he jisase majdoor kam paisa kharch karke zyada urja paa letaa he or kuch samay ke liye uskaa pet bhar jaataa he bhukh shant ho jaati he
 Ramnivas runs a tea shop here for the past 28 years, mostly workers are its customers
 bataate hai ki pehle rojaanaa 24 parle ji biscuit ke packet bik jaaya karte the, jabaki ab mushkil se 2-3 bikate hai
 It is said that since Parle ji made a price of Rs 4 for a packet of 4 rupees, and instead of 16 in the packet of biscuits, he changed the cost of Parcel ji to 13, and since then the worker has started finding Parle ji expensive and he is moving towards the other cheaper option
 
 ramanivas ne bataaya, parle ji kii bikri ab bahut ghat gai he
 Earlier used to sell 24 pieces daily, but now only two or three pieces are sold
 beete chah-saat maheene main zyada antar padaa he
 People are now taking papay, mutti, rusk instead of taking Parleji biscuits with tea
 biscuit kaa packet chota he, 5 rupee kaa jabaki duusare vikalp 1 rupee kaa ek he jisase pet bhar jaataa he
 We found many laborers at the tea shop
 ek factory main kaam karne vaale kishor kumaar sharma ne bataaya ki pehle ke mukaable parle ji biscuit 1 rupye mahangaa ho gaya he or teen biscuit bhi usamen kam ho gaye hai jisaki vajah se ham log parle ji biscuit ab nahin kha rahe hai
 Also, the condition of companies here is very bad, due to which we are facing difficulty in getting salary
 ek nijee company main security guard kaa kaam karne vaale ompal mili
 8 thousand rupees a month
 bataate hai jabase parle ji ne biscuit ke packet kaa vajan ghataya, tabase chaay ke saath paape khaakar kaam chalaa rahe hai or har baar 2 rupee bachaa rahe hai
 According to the labor union, at first Parleji was the cheapest and favorite of the working class, but after demonetisation and GST, the salary of the laborer is not increasing but the fear of going to the job is more, Parle ji lost more weight
 isliye mazdooron ek ek rupee bachaane main lage hai jisase use 5 rupye kaa biscuit bhi mahangaa lagane laga he
 Sahibabad chief of the Center for Industrial Trade Union Ishwar Singh Tyagi said, the laborer is thinking to save every single rupee by some means
 chaay pani main ek do rupee bachaae 5-10 rupee bachaae
 Save in the biscuits there
 ab dekho parle ji kaa biscuit pehle log kha liya karte the
 The laborer used to eat Parle ji's biscuits very happy, but what has happened now, Parle ji's biscuit is coming for 5 rupees, in which the laborers are eating 2 rupees of a mutti
 biscuit kii kshamta gata di gai he
 Earlier 16 packets used to come in a packet, now 13 are coming
 kul milakar kahani yah he ki pehle parle ji 4 rupye kaa biscuit kaa packet aayaa karata tha, jisamen 16 biscuit mila karte the
 But after the introduction of GST, the tax on biscuits increased from 12 percent to 18 percent
 jiske chalate company ne biscuit ke packet par 1 rupye badhaayaa or teen biscuit kam kar die
 Economic conditions are also going bad in the country, in such a situation, the working class did not like this decision, due to which the demand was reduced and the result is that the company is talking about retrenchment of employees

 2009 main jab congress ne centre main dobaaraa satta hasil kii thi uske baad pehali baar congress ke pradesh karyaalay main is tarah dhoomdhaam se kisi chunavi jeet par jashn manaaya ja rahaa tha
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress was reduced to 2 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and only 7 seats in the 2017 assembly elections
 aise main ab congress ke liye hindi belt ke teen pradeshon—rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main chunavi jeet ne uttar pradesh main party ko apni sambhaavnaaen majboot karne kii raah khol di he
 Rajeshwar Kumar, associate professor and political affairs expert at Lucknow University, says, "the electoral victories in the Hindi-speaking states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will help the Congress build an organization in the Gangetic plains
 party ke saamne ab in rajyon kii safalataa kaa ek model he
 On the same lines, the Congress can improve the organization in Uttar Pradesh and open the way for good performance in the next Lok Sabha elections
 ''nae sire se taiyaar hoga sanghathanmadhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh main shandaar pradarshan ke baad congress ab upi main sanghathan ko nae sire se loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaar karne kaa tanabana bun rahi he
 Uttar Pradesh Congress state president Raj Babbar, who has done more than 100 election rallies as a star campaigner in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, will now devote most of his time to the organization in the state
 ve kehete hai, ''sabhi sanghathanon or kaaryakartaaon kaa kaam ke aadhaar par moolyankan kiya jayega

 After former Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi joined the BJP, the Congress, which is trying to get hold of women, is looking forward to forward Aradhana Mishra, daughter of senior leader Pramod Tiwari and MLA from Rampur Khas

 In order to deal with the increasing activism of the RSS in the state, the outline of the programs being run continuously through the Seva Dal before the Lok Sabha elections will be finalized soon
 seva dal se jude ek padaadhikari bataate hai, ''seva dal kaaryakarta gaanv-gaanv pahunchakar prabhaat feriyaan nikaalenge
 Participation of farmers, women and youth will be increased in these
 '' rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh main sarkaar banane ke baad congress sanghathan main aane vaali majbootee kaa laabh in rajyon se sate uttar pradesh ke jilon par bhi padegaa

 jaldbaaji main gathbandhan nahinuttar pradesh ke padosi rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress kii jeet ne pradesh main bhi party ke kad main ijapha kiya he
 Mayawati, the national president of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Akhilesh Yadav, the national president of the Samajwadi Party (SP), may have announced support for the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, but in Uttar Pradesh, these parties will give more importance to the Congress
 Are not in lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main associat professor or saamaajik-rajnatik maamalon ke jaankaar manish hindvi bataate hai, ''chunaav nateezon ne upi main bhi congress ko akele loksabhaa chunaav main jane kii himmat di he
 These results have also put pressure on the SP and BSP to take the Congress along, who are preparing to build an alliance before the Lok Sabha elections in the name of stopping the BJP
 '' pradesh main sapa or basapa bhale hi congress se duuri banaae hue hon lekin congress netaa in partiyon par naram rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 After the results of the assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi said in conversation with journalists at the party headquarters in New Delhi that "the ideology of SP and BSP is similar to that of Congress
" ''uttar pradesh main bhaajapa virdohi gathbandhan main sabase bada pech siton ke bantwaare ko lekar he
 Both the SP and the BSP are willing to give less than 10 seats to the Congress
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main congress ke ek bade netaa bataate hai, ''bhaajapa virdohi gathbandhan kaa mukhya aadhaar muslim maton main kisi bantwaare ko rokna he
 After a landslide victory in the assembly elections, the Muslim voters of the state may be inclined towards the Congress because it is the only party that can compete with the BJP at the national level
 '' uttar pradesh main congress rashtriya lokdal ke saath gathbandhan kar chuki he lekin duusari partiyon ko lekar vah jaldbaaji main nahin he
 The party is ready to decorate the tableau of opposition unity once again at the government's swearing-in ceremony in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in which invitations will also be sent to Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 yuvaaon par badhegaa bharosalokasabhaa chunaav se pehle apni dhamak dikhaane ke liye congress uttar pradesh main yuvaaon ko aage karne kii ranneeti par kaam or tej karegi
 Senior Congress leader and national panelist Surendra Rajput says, "congress President Rahul Gandhi has always reposed trust in the youth
 yuva josh or anubhav ke mail se hi vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne pataakaa fahraai he
 With the presence of Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan and Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, the trend of the Congress will increase among the youth of Uttar Pradesh
 ''congress ne devaria ke keshav chandra yadav ko yuvak congress kaa rashtriya adhyaksh banaakar pichde varg ke yuvaaon ko lubhaane kaa daanv chalaa he
 This is the first time after Narayan Dutt Tiwari that a youth of Uttar Pradesh has been given the responsibility of national president
 raibareli se vidhayak aditi singh ko akhil bhartiya mahila congress kii rashtriya mahaamantri or jonpur se purv vidhayak nadeem javed ko alpsankhyak vibhaag kii kaman saunpi gai he
 The Congress is also working on a soft Hindutva agenda as well as a strategy to balance the Muslim youth further
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main saharanpur se aane vaale purv vidhayak or tej-tarraar netaa imran masood ko pradesh upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Masood is an important link in the dalit-muslim alliance strategy of the Congress in Western UP
 isi prakaar pradesh main pravaktaaon or penlist main hilaal nakvi, jishaan haidar, saf ali nakvi ke saath rafat fatima, sadaf jafar jaisi mahilaon ko jagah dekar muslim yuvaaon main paith banane kii ranneeti bhi he
 The Congress has also put forward the young Muslim women leaders of the party to cut the stakes of the BJP to woo Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kuch or yuva netaaon ko mahatvapurn jimmedaari dekar congress behad aakraamak dhang se apane chunavi abhiyaan main jutane kii taiyaari kar chuki he
 However, the real test of the Congress, which hoists the victory flag in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, will be to burn its life in a dull organization in UP
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii centre main satta vaapasi kii ummiden tabhi paravaan chadhengi jab 'haath' ko upi kaa saath milegaa
 Mayawati is not possible to be ignored
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on 6 December bhimrao ambedkar ke parinirvana diwas par hone vaale shradghanjali kaaryakramon main bad-chadh kar hissaa leti thi par is baar maahaul kuch thanda tha
 While senior party leaders had camped in the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the national president Mayawati was also busy in the election rallies
 uttar pradesh main lagaataar chunavi haar ke baad sanghathan bhi kis tarah utsaahhin ho chukaa tha, isaki jhalak lakhanu ke gomtinagar sthit dow
 Ambedkar was also seen at the tribute ceremony organized at the social change site
 pichley varshon main mayawati kii gairmaujuudagi main hui shradghanjali sabhaaon main saamaajik parivartan sthal ke bheetar mukhya gumbad ke saamne kaa hissaa puraa bhar jaaya karata tha par is baar jo bheed juty, vah mukhya gumbad ke bheetar maujuud ambedkar kii pratimaa ke irdagird simat kar rah gai thi
 However, the song 'sister Mayawati will get the crown, not someone's Gundaraja Chalega' was playing continuously from the loudspeaker on the road outside the venue

 Five days later, on December 11, the results of the five state assembly elections remained silent even as the results came
 nai dilli main gurudwara rakabganj road sthit basapa ke kendriya karyaalay main 11 disambar kii subah kuch netaa jute
 After full results in the evening, the BSP had captured 2 seats in Madhya Pradesh, 6 in Rajasthan and 2 seats in Chhattisgarh
 vahiin varsh 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main basapa in teen rajyon main kul 8 siten hi jeet pai thi
 The bsp's electoral performance was steadily falling after UP was voted out of power in 2012
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek bhi seat na jeetne vaali basapa ke liye paanch rajyon ke chunavi nattejey 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle zyada raahat lekar nahin aae hai
 That is why Mayawati said, "the election results of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are not according to the expectations of the party
" party isaki samiksha kar aage kii ranneeti tay karegi
 '' Dr
 in Lucknow bhimrao ambedkar vishvavidhyalay main associat professor vivekanand bataate hai, ''madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh main basapa ne bhale hi mahaj 10 siten jiti hon par party ko mili maton ne rashtriya raajnneeti main mayawati kii haisiyat main ijapha kiya he
 Mayawati may have a bigger role in the anti-bjp alliance formed before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ''chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii janata congress chhattisgarh se gathbandhan kar basapa ne 3
 Won 9 percent of the vote
 vahiin madhya pradesh or rajasthan main party kii vot hissedari kramshah 4

 a former BSP coordinator in western UP says, "the impact of the election results of five states will be seen in UP as well
" pichley chunaavon main chhitak chukaa vot bank basapa ke jhande tale ekajute hoga
 The election results of the five states were not encouraging for the Samajwadi Party (SP)
 sapa ko mahaj ek seat par santosh karnaa padaa
 This result has determined Mayawati's leading role in the possible alliance between SP and BSP in UP
 basapa ke ek purv saansad bataate hai, ''kisi bhi gathbandhan main party upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main aadhi se adhik siton par chunaav ladegi
 As a strategy, the SP and the BSP are refraining from holding public discussions on the alliance before the Lok Sabha elections code of conduct next year
