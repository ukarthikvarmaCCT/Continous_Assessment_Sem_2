 Another issue of the matter, Haji Mahboob said that we will not accept the tingling

 Respected Sakshi Maharaj, pranaam
 i am writing salutations and respectful to you because you are older than me in age, and second and foremost in front of your name, saints like 'saint' and 'maharaj' are used
 aise main main aapako 'dear' or 'hai' kahkar sambodhit karne kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakati
 Not much is known about you, nor has there ever been a desire to know, but ever since the new government has come to the center, you come in the headlines every time
 pehle godse vaale bayaan par, phir kal hindu mahilaon ke chaar bacchon ko janm dene vaale bayaan par
 i am in awe of your statement, because i do not know how to react
 
 
 kyonki janm se main bhi hindu hum, or stri bhi, lekin phir bhi aapke chaar bacchon vaale aahvaan ko aatmsaat karne ke mood main nahin hum
 Now it is not that i am against it at all, but i have some questions in my mind
 
 
 agar aap mujhe unka jawaab de den to kya pataa meraa bhi man badal jaae
 You said that every Hindu woman should give birth to four children and one of them should be given to monks and the other should be sent to fight at the border
 pehali baat yah ki main mere bachche ko khud se alag nahin karnaa chaahati, kam se kam tab tak, jab tak ki vah apana khyaal khud rakhane laayak na ho jaae or na hi kabhi bhi yah chaahuungi ki vah bhagava andolan kaa hissaa bane
 Secondly, even if i decide to send him in the army or army as you said, then i have to maintain him for 20-22 years before going there
 main mere saat saal ke bete ko dilli ke ek convent skool main padhaa rahi hum, isliye chaahati hum ki baaki ke bachche bhi usee str kii shiksha paaen
 Will you take care of their education and upbringing before going into the army? 
 
 ? kya aap meri in donon sthitiyon, yaa yun kahe sharten maanane ko taiyaar hai
 
 
 The pataa nahin, aap tivi dekhte hai yaa nahin, par maine kal hi tivi par dekha ki sarkaar legal garbhpaat ke samarthan main ek aid chalaa rahi he, jisamen saaf taur par yah kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi sthiti main garbhpaat hamen sarkari doctoron kii dekharekh main hi karaane chahie
 However, there will be many rules in it, which i have to find out now
 ab yaa to aap apni sarkaar kii raay se ittfa nahin rakhte yaa sarkaar aapaki raay se
 
 
 There is a big wall of communication gap between you
 
 
 tabhi to aapke vichaar itane juda hai
 Your party president also denied your statement and said that this is your personal comment and further decision will be taken by the party's Discipline Committee
 aapane kahin par yah bhi kaha ki 'in deshadrohiyon ko santosh nahin hua he
 
 
 'I am confused about which people you are talking about
 
 
 ? kripaya khulkar bataaen
 
 
 Sakshi Maharaj, don't you think that you are using poor, religious, less educated women to fulfill your personal ambitions
 kya aap nafrat kii raajnneeti ko mahilaon kii keemat par falana-failaana nahin chaahate hai
 If it is not, then my direct question to you is why did you make this call in a religious meeting
 
 
 ? kya aap aisa aahvaan fikki ke mahila sammelnon yaa army yaa airforce ke kisi function main kar sakate hai
 
 
 The Probably not, because then nobody will take you serially there
 
 
 aapane jaan-boojhkar un mahilaon ko apana target audiyans banaaya, jinke jivan kaa vistaar hi dharm main hota he
 For whom religion and religious leaders are the essence of life
 
 
 ye ve mahilaayein hai, jinhone apane paanv par abhi khadaa hona nahin siikhaa he, jinhen ghar kii charadivari se nikalne ke liye dharm kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Maharaj, these are women who are financially dependent on others, whether it is husband or son
 
 
 vah doosraa vyakti hi he
 You have said, but have you ever thought that if a woman produces four children, then how will her own health end, if she will have children even at the gap of four years, then the important 16 years of her life The children will be raised in the cradle, and during this time, along with his body, his mind will also become a victim of osteoporosis forever
 ab bataaie, main kaise aapke bayaan ko mahila virdohi or vyaktigat mahatvakankshaon ke liye mahilaon kaa istemaal karne vaala or dhoort bayaan na maanu
 
 
 The maharaj, main hindu stri hum, hindu dharm ke anusaar jivan ji rahi hum, apane bete ko ek bhai yaa bahan bhi dena chaahati hum, lekin iske saath-saath apane aap se bhi behad pyaar karti hum
 i do not want my bones to be so weak when i step into old age that i cannot climb mountains, i want to live well, with my family and my child
 
 
 unke saath ghoomana-phirana, samundar kii saiyr karnaa, hansi-thahaake lagaana, apane dukh share karnaa, apane buudhe hote mata-pita kii dekhbhaal karnaa, film dekhnaa
 
 
 i want to do all this
 main nahin chaahati ki meraa baccha hameshaa yah shikaayat karte hue bada ho ki meri maa ke paas kabhi mere liye vakt nahin rahaa, kyonki bachche ko sabase juyada apni maa kii zarurat hoti he
 Last and foremost, i do not want to be financially dependent on others, i want to earn all these happiness on my own, through my hard work
 
 
 kisi rishte kii aad main bonus swaroop nahin
 In such a situation, i have no choice but to ignore you
 
 
 agar aap mere in sawaalon kaa jawaab de den to shaayad meraa maargdarshan ho

 sibiai ke jaanch adhikari e ji el kaul ne aaj gajiabad main court main bayaan diya he ki is hatyakand main vijay mandal, rajkumaar or krishna kaa koi haath nahin tha
 The investigating officer has pointed fingers at the Talwar couple for the murder

 According to the official, no evidence has been found of the presence of any third person in the house and no one other than the Talwar couple was present there

 He said that it was Rajesh and Nupur Talwar who carried out the incident

 uttar pradesh police in dinon karmchaariyon (pulicekarmiyon) kii baari killat se jujh rahi he
 Experts believe that the lack of police force is also a main reason behind the worsening law and order situation in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh main naagarik police kii kul taadaad 2
 95 lakhs, but the total number of actual serving policemen is 1
 45 lakh ke aas-paas he
 This means a shortage of about 50 percent of the police force overall
 ye aankade uttar pradesh police dwaara haal main taiyaar kii gai vistrut aantarik report main saamne aae hai
 According to the report, the biggest reduction is at the level of head constables, which is around 65 percent
 constablon kii kami kii baat kii jaay to wo kareeb 45 fisadi, nirikshakon or up-nirikshakon kii kami kramash: 50 or 55 pratishat he
 Arun Kumar, Additional Director General of Police (law and Order), Uttar Pradesh, refrains from saying much that he believes that such a huge shortage of police force definitely affects the law and order situation with more burden on the serving policemen
 
 police vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke mutabik, uttar pradesh main pulicekarmiyon kaa prati lakh jansankhya par ausat keval 74 he, jo desh main keval bihar (prati lakh jansankhya par 63 pulicekarmi) se behatar he
 Talking about the national average, the police average per lakh population in the country is 130, which is less than 207 in Pakistan
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne beete bajet satr ke dauraan haalanki kaha ki rajya sarkaar police karmiyon kii kami dur karne ke liye 2,200 computer oparator, chaar hajaar up-nireekshak or 24 hajaar constablon kii bhartee karegi
 Even if these policemen are recruited in the coming time, even then the shortage of police force will hardly be less
 rajya ke ek purv police mahanideshak ne naam se saarvajanik hone kii shart par kaha ki soobe main police bal kii itani baari kami hone ke baavjood police bal ke ek bade hisse kaa prayog viipi duty main kiya jaataa he
 He said that every VIP especially politicians want to be surrounded by policemen from all four sides
 uttar pradesh police ke purv police mahanireekshak aas aar darapuri kehete hai ki ek to polisbal kii kami or ek bade hisse kii tainaati viipi duty main rahane se rajya main kanoon-vyavastha prabhavit ho rahi he, kyonki police kaa mukhya jimmaa aparaadh ko rokna or kanoon-vyavastha ko banaae rakhana hota he
 He said that if the police force deployed in VIP security is minimized, success can be achieved in the control of law and order to some extent
 rajya ke purv police mahanideshak ke el gupta kehete hai ki kanoon-vyavastha ek badi samasya hone ke baavjood soobe main police bal kii ye kami kaaphi lambey vakt se chali aa rahi he
 The governments that came to power were certainly not shown as much seriousness as they should have in filling the shortage of police force

 sanjay lila bhansaali ke dream project film inshollah se salmaan khan alag ho chuke hai
 Why Salman broke all ties with the film after the finals, the exact answer to this question has not been found yet
 is bich ye khabaren bhi aa rahi hai ki bhansaali apane project ko rokenge nahin
 According to reports, Bhansali has decided to replace Salman with Shah Rukh Khan in Inshallah
 sutron ke mutabik inshollah film main salmaan ke baad bhansaali ne shahrukh khan se baatcheet kii he
 Soon Bhansali is going to make an official announcement to make the film with Shah Rukh
 kyon salmaan kii jagah shahrukh hi sahi?shahrukh khan ke project main aana sanjay or shahrukh donon ke liye behatar hoga
 There are many reasons for this
 inshollah main jis tarah kaa kirdaar bataaya ja rahaa he use shahrukh hi behatar dhang se nibhaa sakate hai
 According to reports, the film is a love story, in which the hero is aged and heroin is of young age
 aise main is kirdaar ko bollywood ke kisi yang hero kii bajaay shahrukh behatar dhang se nibhaa sakate hai
 Shahrukh also has his own image of a romantic hero
 wo bhansaali ke saath devdas main kaam bhi kar chuke hai
 Although Shahrukh will work in this film or not, nothing can be said about it right now
 vaise shahrukh aalia bhatta ke saath isse pehle dear jindagi main kuch-kuch aisa hi kirdaar kar chuke hai
 However, the film was not liked by the audience and proved to be a flop for the makers

 The Prime Minister intervened in the Lok Sabha during the Question Hour, the Finance Minister said in his budget speech, and i responded to the President's address
 
 The factors responsible for this were mentioned
 manmohan ne kaha, iske kai antarrashtriya kaarak hai
 There have been two crises in the international system
 ek 2008-09 kaa banking sankat he, uske baad 2011 main eurozon sankat aayaa
 Manmohan said, these things affect our economy
 lekin iske anya kaarak bhi hai
 There are domestic factors also and we are trying to deal with all these problems

 Although we are in trouble, we are confident as the Finance Minister said in his budget speech

 Manmohan said, it has many international factors
 antarrashtriya vyavastha main do sankat aae hai
 One is the banking crisis of 2008–09, followed by the Eurozone crisis in 2011
 manmohan ne kaha, ye chijen hamaari arthvyavastha par asar daalati hai
 But there are other factors as well
 iske gharelu kaarak bhi hai or ham in sabhi samasyaon se nipatane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The comments pradhanmantri prashnkaal ke dauraan bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke sadsy shahanvaaj hossain dwaara maujuuda aarthik paridrishy par puche gaye ek prashn kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Manmohan said, i will urge the House that nothing is going to be achieved by toppling the sentiments of its people
 yadhyapi ham mushkil main hai, lekin hamen bharosa he jaisaa ki vitt mantri ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaha tha
 We are confident that in two-three years we will be able to bring the economy back on the path of strong growth

 vah piesi main tainaat ek sab-inspector kii beti he
 Her boyfriend made some intimate pictures viral on whatsapp, due to which she was upset
 is sambandh main uske pita ne aaropee ke khilaaf cese darj karaayaa he
 According to the information, a 22-year-old girl jumped from the third floor balcony at around 7
12 am on Thursday inside the Cross River Mall in Anand Vihar area of east Delhi
 use turant hedgavaar aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan usne dam tod diya
 The entire incident was captured in the mall's CCTV camera
 suicide note main maangi maafeelogon kii madad se guard use uthaakar paas ke hedgavaar aspataal le gaya, jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan uski maut ho gai
 a suicide note written by the girl has also been found, which is soaked with water
 usamen ladki ne apane maa-baap se maafee maangi hai

 rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ajtak ne rajya kii nabj tatolane kaa kaam kiya
 All the issues related to the Rajasthan elections were discussed on Thursday in Aaj Tak's special program 'panchayat Aajtak'
 kaarykram ke chauthe satr 'kiskaa hoga rajasthan' main karani sena ke netaa lokentre singh kaalvi ne kai daawey kiye
 During this, he said that Vasundhara Advani will enter the mode after the election
 is satr ke dauraan bijepi kii diya kumari or congress kii ore se raagini nayak ne bhi hissaa liya
 'vasundhara Advani will enter the mode' Karani Sena leader Lokendra Singh Kalvi claimed that Vasundhara Raje is the 'creation' of former Vice President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 lekin unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki ek baar bhairon singh shekhavat ne unase kaha tha ki vasundhara ko siem banaakar maine bahut badi galati kii
 He claimed - Vasundhara Raje will enter Advani mode after the election
 kaalvi yaheen nahin ruke
 Pointing towards Diya Kumari, he said that the legislature of Sawai Madhopur will enter Modi mode
 kaalvi ne kaha- ajmer upachunaav main bijepi haari
 The name of the Rajput society was maligned
 unhone rajput samaaj se apil karte hue kaha- main to kahata hum ki sabhi 36 comen vot kii chot den
 i will get BJP defeated in Sawai Madhopur
 rajput hone ke daawey par savalkalavi ne vasundhara kaa naam liye bina kaha ki kai log rajput hone kaa clem kar rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that Vasundhara has given many statements that she is the daughter of Rajput and daughter-in-law of Jat family
 is par bhi kaalvi ne tanj kiya
 He said that many people of Rajput society have been opposing the marriage of the exogamous
 'bijepi rajput samaaj se kya chaahati he?'karani sena se jab poocha gaya ki kya aap bijepi ko blackmel karenge to jawaab main is sena ke netaa lokentre singh kaalvi ne kaha- karani sena kii aawaaj buland he
 But what do BJP people want from the Rajput society? Rajputs supported BJP to the extent of slavery, but what is the importance of Rajput society today? There was no political will among the people sitting in Delhi
 yahi vajah thi ki rajasthan, madhya pradesh or gujarat ke alaava film padmavat deshbhar main relies hui
 Did we and you (diya Kumari) not meet Amit Shah on Padmavat's case? Many conclaves are being held to convince the Rajputs
 congress ne rajputon ko samajhane ke liye kamity banaai he
 When i was ill, both the national presidents (congress and BJP) asked about my well being
 tab maine samajha ki meraa nahin rajput samaaj kaa haalchaal puch rahe hai

 If the Prime Minister, who came to the press conference for the first time in five years, did not answer the questions of journalists, then why are they so disappointed? The Prime Minister's stance actually states that he does not care about this journalism
 agar unako yah ehsaas hota ki patrakaron se baat na karne ke nuqasaan honge to ve koob baat karte, tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab dete
 But how will this damage happen? The Prime Minister, who did not give a second time to the journalists, kept his head completely on the eyes
 pradhanmantri apane dauron par media ko nahin le jate rahe, bas ek team unke saath hua karti thi, lekin kya mazaal ki unke kisi bhi bhaashan kii report chhuti ho
 In the last five years, wherever they went, whatever they said, jin-jin's hug or fall, the media reported all of them with great loyalty
 pradhanmantri ne bataaya ki kisi desh se 100 million dollar kaa nivesh aa rahaa he to bina tasdik kiye maan liya ki ve sach hi bol rahe honge, agar pradhanmantri ne bataaya ki unke rahete aatankiyon ke hausale tut chuke hai tab kisi ne nahin poocha ki phir itane aatanki hamale kyon ho rahe hai
 If the media coverage received by different leaders is calculated in the last five years, then the Prime Minister will be seen ahead of others
 agar pichley pradhanmantriyon se bhi unki tulana kii jaaegi to bhi pradhanmantri sabko kaafii peeche chhodte dikhenge
 It is a different matter that despite this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and BJP still complained to the media and when they got the opportunity, they were seen trying to teach journalism to journalists who disagreed with them
 jab kisi pradhanmantri ko bina press conference kiye itani kawarej milegi to vah kyonkar press conference karegaa? jab patrakarita uske aage shraddhanath rahegi to vah kyon unako ankhon main aankh daal kar sawaal poochne kaa avasar degaa
 It is not that the Prime Minister did not give interviews during this time
 unhone kai intervyuu die
 Some interviews said that questions and answers were preordained
 in panktiyon ke lekhak ke paas isaki pushti kaa koi zariyaa nahin he
 He considered it necessary to give some interviews to people like Prasoon Joshi and Akshay Kumar
 prasoon joshi kaa intervyuu sabase lanbaa tha lekin chapalusee kii adbhut misaal tha
 By watching that interview, you can learn how not to take an interview
 lekin patrakarita se jude intervyuu bhi achche sawaalon vaale nahin rahe
 Even during the election phase, the Prime Minister spoke to reporters from different channels
 kisi ek bhi intervyuu main yah nahin dikhaa ki unhen asuvidha main daalane vaale sawaal unase puche gaye hon
 Apart from this, the TV channels that have been broadcasting subliminal speeches of their kind over the course of five years raised some serious questions on some occasions, except for very obvious catch-all mistakes
 to jab aisa abaadh prachaar pradhanmantri ko bina press conference ke mil rahaa ho to ve patrakaron ke jawaab dena kyon zaruri samajhate
 It is easy to conclude that a large part of the media was rooted in Modi devotion, so it lost its critical role
 lekin sachai yah he ki khud ko sarkaar virdohi maanane vaale akhbaaron or channelon par bhi jaani-pahachaani aalochana ke alaava koi aisa gambhir vimarsh nahin dikhaa jisase logon ko sahi or sateek suchanaaen mil saken
 Actually, this whole phase is a period of information about a major crisis of journalism
 shaayad patrakarita main jaldi se jaldi khabar dene kaa jo nayaa dabaav he, usne patrakarita ke gun dharm ko lagbhag kshatigrast kar diya he
 This is a period of shocked journalists who have no time to verify the information
 to hota yah he ki kisi bhi strot se koi soochna chali aati he, patrkaar uske bas vaahak hokar rah jate hai, vah use sanshodhit nahin kar pate, usase pratiprashn nahin kar pate
 For example, the BJP and the Prime Minister were most concerned about the fact that during his tenure, terrorism received a befitting reply
 agar isamen 2010 se 2014 ke bich or 2014 ke abhi tak ke aankadon kaa tatasth vishleshan kisi ke paas hota to yah baat bahut spasht ho jaati ki is maamle main unki ore se kiya ja rahaa daawa galat he
 Similarly, the claim of Pakistan being battered after the surgical strike is also doubtful
 ulte pakistan sargical strike ke baad zyaada tikhe dhang se yudhviram ulanghan karata rahaa
 The same can be said about the impact of demonetisation or other economic claims
 aisa nahin ki in aankadon kaa kisi ko dhyaan nahin rahaa hoga
 But gradually this culture is getting destroyed that you ask a question to a powerful man
 yaa agar koi taqatravar aadmi kisi sawaal kaa galat bhi jawaab de to usase phir se nae sire se sawaal poocha jaae
 Amit Shah has the facility to dismiss the entire investigation only when questions are asked about Pragya Thakur
 unhen koi yah bataane vaala nahin hota ki ve galat bol rahe hai
 In journalism, there is only the pretense of asking questions
 tivi par anwarat chalane vaali jo bahasein hoti hai unamem sawaal bhi jane-pahachaane hote hai, jawaab bhi or un bahason ke nattejey bhi
 In such a situation, even if the Prime Minister comes to the press conference, he is pleased with the journalists
 ve patrakaron ke sawaalon ke jawaab nahin dete tab bhi kisi ko bura nahin lagata
 The talk goes on
 'times of india' kaa sampadak rahete hue kabhi dilip padaganvkar ne kaha tha ki desh kaa sabase taqatvar aadmi is desh kaa pradhanmantri he or doosraa sabase taqatvar aadmi 'times of india' kaa sampadak he
 Even then this statement was severely criticized
 kisi achche patrkaar ko takat ke moh main nahin padana chahie
 This fascination first erodes his journalism
 lekin patrakarita jab apana kaam kar rahi hoti he tab vah jis naitik abha se bhari hoti he, uski takat ke aage bhi sab sir jhukaate hai
 But this is probably another era
 ab to haalat ye he ki sattadhish aata he, bhaashan detaa he, krupa kii tarah kuch patrakaron kaa haalchaal poochta he or kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene kii parvaah kiye bina nikal jaataa he or uske ek din baad tamaam akhbaaron or channelon main uski sanyasi mudra main tasviren hoti hai
 In such a situation, to whom should he be accountable and why should he be accountable
 darasal patrakarita ko kuch sawaal apane-aap se bhi poochne kii zarurat he
 Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who arrived on a visit to China, said that in recent years, along with Beijing, New Delhi had got the most polluted cities in the world, but due to the steps taken by the government, the best air quality in the year The number of days has increased
 bataa den, javedkar ne vishwa kii sabase teji badhati arthvyavasthaaon brazil, dakshin africa, bharat or china (bricks) ke mantriyon kii 29veen baithak main shanivaar ko jaavdekar ne kaha, ‘pradooshan ke str ke sandarbh main dilli main behatar dinon kii sankhya badi he or kharaab vaayu gunvattta vaale diwason kii sankhya ghati he

 'baithak main chini samakaksh lee ganjei se baatcheet ke baad jaavdekar ne kaha ki china pradooshan se muqabla karne ke liye khaastaur par beijing main lard rahaa he
 He said, 'china is learning from India
 lee ne poocha ki is saal vaayu pradooshan se kaise niptenge
 This is an ongoing battle and for this new innovations are constantly needed
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki dilli or beijing pradooshan se ladane main sahyog kar rahe hai or isamen vruddhi kii sambhaavnaaon ko talaashenge, kyonki pehle hi donon shaharon ko ‘sistar cities' ghoshit kiya gaya he

 The tiny cellphone has become an essential part of life for most people

 According to telecom regulator TRAI, the number of cellphone subscribers in the country stood at 61 by the end of May 2010
 753 karod thi
 Data from research firm Gartner says that by the year 2014, the number of cellphone connections in the country increased to 99
 3 karod ho jaaegi
 Gartner also estimates that by the end of this year the number of mobile phone holders in India will reach 66 million
 bharat apane padosi mulk china ke baad duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada cell phone bazaar he
 However, this growing trend of 'mobileophobia' has also realized the need to set a separate code of practices
 agar dhang nahin badale to yah cellphone dushwariyon kii vajah bhi ban jaataa he
 atket Specialist Upasana Singh says that cellphone bells cause deep disruption in meetings, hospitals, court premises, theaters, theaters, worship halls, schools, etc
 isliye in sthanon par jane se pehle cellphone ko visamel par yaa wibrasion par rakhana chahie taaki kisi ko vyavdhaan na ho
 It is better to turn off the cell phone in the meeting
 ek anya atikate specialist gaurav das kehete hai ki cellphone par kai log jor jor se baaten karte hai jisase nijee yaa gopneey suchanaaen saarvajanik ho sakati hai
 Similarly, domestic talk can also make others smile as well as make them wince
 gaurav ke anusaar, cell phone par baaten karte samay sanyam banaae rakhana chahie or gusse se bhi parhez nahin karnaa chaiye kyonki ho saktaa he ki aapaki niztaa kaa cheekhta varnan aasapaas baithe yaa khadey vyakti ko na suhaae

 Multimedia applications such as MMS, video etc

 inkaa galat istemaal nahin hona chahie
 He says that if FM radio is being run on a mobile phone, then its voice should be slowed so that others do not have trouble
 aise main yearphone kaa istemaal behatar hota he
 Gaurav says that cell phones should not be used while driving, otherwise you can risk the lives of others along with you

 Salman's lawyer, sister Alvira, bodyguard Shera and manager arrived in the sessions court - Khatri had heard Salman's sentence of five years
 - sijeem dev kumaar khatri se kiya paraamarsh
 - Sessions Judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi reached court
 isse pehle salmaan ke vakil mahesh bora ne kaha tha ki agar aaj seshan court se salmaan ko jamaanat nahin milti he to ve link court main petishan lagaayenge
 He will try his best to hear the bail petition in the Link Court also today, because if it does not happen, then Salman will have to spend at least two more days in Jodhpur Central Jail
 udhar, sarkari vakil bhavani singh bhaati kaa kahana he kiadalatne puraa maamla sun liya he
 Now it is up to the judge whether he will hear the case or not
 unka kahana he ki yah sajaa ke nilamban kaa maamla he, koi niyamit jamaanat kaa maamla nahin
 He said that despite the transfer, it is not right to give the decision of the judge
 bataa den ki yachika par sunwaayee kar rahe jodhpur seshans court ke jaj rabindra kumaar joshi kaa tabadalaa ho gaya he
 The Rajasthan High Court late night issued orders for outright transfers of 87 judges, including Joshi's name
 ye transfar isliye ahm he kyonki jodhpur seshans court main aaj subah saadhe das baje salmaan khan kii bel par sunwaayee honi he
 Hearing on Bell on Friday, Judge Ravindra Joshi reserved the decision and now his transfer has become Sirohi
 joshi kii jagah lenge chandrakumarajoshi kii jagah jodhpur seshans court ke nae jaj ab chandrakumar songra honge
 In such a situation, suspense has been created on who will hear the Bell after the transfer of the current judge
 haalanki, jaankaree ke mutabik ye baat saamne aa rahi he ki chandrakumar aaj charge nahin sanbhaalenge
 If such a situation arises and Joshi does not even hear, then it is possible that the bail petition be transferred to another court
 routine main aisa hota rahaa he
 This transfer is important because on Friday, Judge Ravindra Joshi made this remark during the bail debate, he will look at the court order carefully and he deferred the decision on Bell till date after hearing all the arguments of Salman's lawyer
 aise main bel par sunwaayee rabindra joshi ke bajaay nae jaj chandrakumar karte hai yaa phir kisi or court main bel yachika jaati he to is baat kii bhi ashanka he ki salmaan ko aaj bhi raahat na mil paae
 However, senior counsel KK Manan said that since Judge Joshi had reserved the judgment yesterday (friday), it is more likely that he will pronounce the verdict on Salman's bail today
 vahiin, kaala hiran shikaar cese main bishnoi samaaj ke vakil mahipal bishnoi kaa kahana he ki april ke maheene main aise routine transfar pehle bhi hote rahe hai, isliye ise kisi tarah dekhnaa uchit nahin he
 However, suspense remains on Salman's bail till now
 agar salmaan ko aaj jamaanat nahin milti he to unhen kam se kam do din or jail kii salaakhon ke peeche gujaarne padenge
 Tomorrow will not be held due to Sunday
 isliye aaj salmaan or unke parivaar ke liye behad ahm din he

 Dabdi Dalit leader of Bihar Chedi Paswan is the fourth such leader who has to pay the price to meet Modi
 isse pehle sadhu yadav, dasai choudhary apni partiyon se baahar kiye ja chuke hai
 Chedi Paswan is such that after meeting Modi, the party did not give the time of day, even for an hour
 chhedi paswan ne gandhinagar main mulaakaat kii, lekin surya ast hone ke pehle hi unhen party ne 6 saal ke liye nilambit kar diya
 While returning from meeting Narendra Modi, Chedi Paswan told Aaj Tak that it is wrong to call Modi communal, Modi is completely secular
 chhedi paswan ne is baat ko pukhta karne ke liye modi ke us kisse ko sunaaya, jo bakaul chhedi paswan, narendra modi ne unhen ek ghante kii mulaakaat main sunaaya
 According to him, Modi helped a Muslim boy, who was languishing in jail, for threatening Modi
 modi ne na sirf us ladke kii madad kii, balki uski bahan kii shaadi karai or dobaaraa jail se baahar aane par uski naukari bhi behaal karai
 Actually Chedi Paswan was angry with Nitish Kumar for a long time

 On one side, Nitish's mlas were meeting Modi, on the other hand Nitish's ministers were treating Narendra Modi as a man-eater in a party meeting
 baharhaal, yah spasht he ki modi ke bihar aane main mahinebhar kaa bhi vakt nahin bachaa he
 In such a situation, it is certain that the JDU will be deepened in the name of Modi

 In this letter, concern has been expressed that the target of doubling the rail line for 2016 was set at 1600 km
 lekin is lakshya ke ulat railway ne disambar tak mahaj 531 kilometre kii rail line kaa doharikaran kiya he
 Apart from this, it has been said in the letter that the target of electrification of the rail line was set to be 2000 km for 2016, but only 1210 km of rail line has been electrified so far
 nripendra mishra ke is patr memrelway mantralayase kaha gaya he ki unako ummid he ki railway apane lakshya se zyada kaa kaam karegaa
 By doing this, the Railways will justify that the amount given for its development works in the next year's budget is reasonable

 In response to this report, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said that the sequel to ohchr's report is a continuation of his previous false and politically motivated discussions on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki is report main kahi gai baaten bharat kii samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kaa ulanghan karti hai or usamen seemapar aatankwaad ke mul mudde kii andekhi kii gayi he
 Kumar said that the situation arising out of the cross-border terrorism that has been going on in Pakistan over the years and the casualties due to it has been analyzed without citing it
 yah duniya ke sabase bade or jeevant loktantr ke saath aatankwaad kaa khuleam samarthan karne vaale desh kii kritrim rup se barabari karne kii kaalpanik koshish bhar he
 He said that we have strongly objected to this link from the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bharat ne pichley saal bhi sanyukt raashtra kii is report ko khaarij kar diya tha
 At the time, India rejected the UN report on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir, calling it 'misleading'

 We question the intent of this report

 Significantly, in the ongoing report, the United Nations had spoken out about alleged human rights violations in Kashmir and demanded an international inquiry in this regard

 Efforts are on to evacuate 12 football players and their coaches trapped in the cave of Thailand
 kharaab mausam or oxigen kii kami kii vajah se oparation main kaaphi dikkatein aa rahi hai
 These players have been trapped inside the caves since June 23, which is filled with water
 is bich thai adhikariyon ne ravivaar ko kaha ki ab ve sabase pehle uttari thailand main gupha ke aasapaas ke kshetra ko khaali karne kii yojana bana rahe hai, jisase khilaadiyon or unke coach ko bachaane kaa kaam kiya ja sake
 The announcement comes after the northern mountains of the country were hit by rain on Sunday morning
 khilaadiyon or unke 25 varshiya coach ko bachaane ke liye bachaav dal ko pani or samay ke saath jang ladani pad rahi he
 Football players trapped in the cave are aged between 11 and 16 years
 aapako bataa den ki mausam vibhaag ne 15 july tak baari barish kii ashanka jataai he
 What are there to save children? The plan is filled with water within the cave and it may take up to 5-6 hours to come out
 gotaakhor oxigen silendar ke saath tairkar andar ja sakate hai lekin bacchon ke liye silendar ke saath itane lambey vakt tak tairnaa mumkin nahin hoga
 Also, the children are very tired and have become weak due to lack of food
 aise main agar barish kii vajah se pani kaa str bad jaataa he to bacchon ko nikaalnaa mushkil hoga
 According to the information, to bring a child out of the cave, at least 2 divers have to be engaged
 tub ke jariye nikaalane kii koshishgupha main tub daalkar bacchon ke baahar nikaalane ke upaay par bhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The local construction company has suggested to the rescue team that they can bring the children out through a tube going from outside to inside
 yah tub pani ke bheetar daale jaaenge jinke andar pani nahin hoga
 But it may also suffer from lack of oxygen and suffocation within it
 chimniyon se baahar nikaalane par vichaarbachaav dal ne gupha ke upar pahaad par chimaniyaan banaakar bacchon ko baahar nikaalane kii koshish par bhi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 More than 100 chimneys have been built for this
 inhen 400 meter gaharai tak daalaa jayega lekin is kaam main dikkat yah he ki abhi tak bacchon kii lokation kaa sateek pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa he
 The depth of the cave can be more than this

 ' BCCI ne supreme court main apana jawaab daakhil karte hue lodha cameti kii zyaadaatar siforeeshon kaa virodh kiya he
 In its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the BCCI said that the expenses of BCCI are more
 isliye har over ke baad vigyaapan dikhaanaa jaruri hota he kyonki in vigyapanon se kharche nikalate hai
 If these advertisements are not shown, that will also affect the broadcasting rights
 lodha cameti ne apni sifarish main har over ke baad vigyaapan dikhaane ko manaa kiya tha
 The BCCI stated in its affidavit that being a member of the State Cricket Association and a member of the BCCI are both different things
 rajya cricket association or BCCI donon alag-alag tareeke se kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, the recommendation of the Lodha Committee is not correct, in which the committee said that a member of the State Cricket Association and a member of the BCCI cannot be a person in both these positions
 70 saal se zyada umr ke log agar BCCI main rahete hai to unke anubhavon kaa BCCI ko phayda milegaa
 Therefore, the recommendation of the Lodha Committee cannot be accepted that a person above the age of 70 should not be a member of the BCCI
 vahiin, BCCI ne lodha cameti kii us sifarish kaa bhi virodh kiya he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki koi mantri BCCI kaa pad nahin le saktaa
 In its affidavit, the BCCI stated that doing so would be a violation of article 93
 artical 93 kahata he ki kisi bhi vyakti ko sadsy banane se nahin roka ja saktaa
 If he is eligible
 BCCI ne yah bhi kaha ki har rajya se ek sadsy kaa BCCI main shaamil hona sambhav nahin he
 It may be known that Justice Lodha had said in his recommendation that one member from every state should be a member of BCCI
 tippaniyan In fact, in the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had bluntly said that the Justice RM Lodha panel's report on reforms in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would have to be implemented
 court ne sakht lahaze main kaha tha ki maamla khatm or duusari pari kii gunjaaish nahin he
 Hearing the petition of the Cricket Association of Bihar, the Chief Justice had made a strong comment, saying that the matter is now over
 lodha panel kii report vyavhaarik or taarkik, isse sweekaar kiijie
 We know that this will trouble big people, especially those in big positions

 isliye lodha cameti kii is sifarish ko bhi nahin mana ja saktaa ki 70 se zyada umr ke vyakti ko BCCI kaa sadsy nahin hona chahie
 At the same time, the BCCI has also opposed the recommendation of the Lodha Committee, in which they said that no minister can take the post of BCCI
 apane halafname main BCCI ne kaha ki aisa karnaa artical 93 kaa ulanghan hoga
 Article 93 says that no person can be prevented from becoming a member

 congress ke diggaj netaa kamalnath rajya kii kaman sanbhali
 He was elected an MP 38 years ago and was sworn in as the 31st Chief Minister of the state on Monday
 kamalnath ko aath maheene pehle hi madhya pradesh congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 When he was made the state president, it again came up in the discussion that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi considered him his 'third son'
 darasal, ek baar indira gandhi chhindwara loksabhaa seat se lard rahe kamalnath ke liye chunaav prachaar karne ai thim
 Indira then told people at the election rally, 'kamal Nath is like a third son to me
 kripaya unhen vot dijie'saal 1979 main kamalnath ne morarji desai kii sarkaar se muqabla karne main congress kii madad kii thi
 Kamal Nath was Sanjay Gandhi's hostelmate and also went to jail for him in Morarji Desai's government after the Emergency
 39 saal baad 72 saal ke kamalnath ne ab indira gandhi ke pote congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye bhi madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main damdaar bhoomika nibhaai he
 Kamal Nath's Journey Kamal Nath is counted among the leading politicians of the country
 madhya pradesh ne desh ko jitne bhi nami rajaneta die hai unamem se ek kamalnath bhi hai
 Born on 18 November 1946 in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Nath did his schooling from the famous Doon School
 doon skool main unki dosti sanjay gandhi se hui
 After studying from the Doon School, Kamal Nath earned a b from St
 Xavier's College, Kolkata
 com kiya
 On 27 January 1973, Kamal Nath tied the knot with Alka Nath
 kamalnath ke do bete hai
 His elder son Nakulnath is active in politics
 34 saal kii umr main jeeta pehla chunaavkamalnath 9 baar loksabhaa ke liye chune ja chuke hai
 He won elections for the first time from Chhindwara in 1980 at the age of 34 which continues till now
 kamalnath 1985, 1989, 1991 main lagaataar chunaav jite
 From 1991 to 1995 he held the Ministry of Environment in the Narasimha Rao government
 vahiin 1995 se 1996 tak ve kapadaa mantri rahe
 Kamal Nath also won the 1998 and 1999 elections
 lagaataar jeet hasil karne se kamalnath kaa congress main kad badhata gaya or 2001 main unhen mahasachiv banaaya gaya
 He remained the General Secretary of the party till 2004
 chhindwara main to jeet kaa doosraa naam kamalnath ho gaye or 2004 main unhone ek baar phir jeet hasil kii
 This was his 7th consecutive win
 gandhi parivaar kaa sabase kareebi hone kaa inaam bhi unako miltaa rahaa or is baar manmohan singh kii sarkaar main ve phir mantri bane or is baar unhen vaanijya mantralay mila
 He held this important ministry for the entire 5 years in the UPA-I government
 iske baad 2009 main chunaav hua or ek baar phir congress kaa yah diggaj netaa loksabhaa ke liye chunaa gaya
 This 'lotus' of the Congress continued to bloom in Chhindwara and this time under the Manmohan Singh government, he got the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 saal 2012 main kamalnath sansadeey kaarymantri bane
 The important responsibility that was given in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath is counted among those Congress leaders who are always with the party even in times of crisis
 chaahe wo rajeev gandhi kaa nidhan ho, 1996 se lekar 2004 tak jis sankat se congress guzar rahi thi, is dauraan bhi vah party ke saath rahe wo bhi tab jab sharad pavaar jaise diggaj netaaon ne party kaa saath chhod diya tha
 He became the President of Madhya Pradesh Congress on 26 April 2018
 unhen arun yadav kii jagah adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 How came into politics Kamal Nath was born in Kanpur, studied in Dehradun and West Bengal, but what happened was that Kamal Nath had to do politics from Madhya Pradesh
 darasal desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik parivaar se aane vaale sanjay gandhi kii dosti doon skool main pashchim bengal se aane vaale kamalnath se hui
 The friendship started from Doon School gradually became family
 doon skool se padhai karne ke baad kamalnath kolkata ke saint jevier college pahunche
 Though the city changed, the friendship of the two did not last long
 kamalnath purv piem indira gandhi ke daur se hi gandhi parivaar ke kareebi rahe hai
 Kamal Nath wanted to grow his business
 aise main ek baar phir doon skool ke ye donon dost phir kareeb aa gaye
 It is said that during the Emergency period, when the company of Kamal Nath was running in crisis, Sanjay Gandhi played an important role in removing it from it
 sanjay gandhi kii chhavi ek tejatarraar netaa ke taur par hoti thi
 Kamal Nath lived with this young son of Indira Gandhi all the time
 bade bete rajeev gandhi ko raajnneeti main aane kii ichha nahin thi
 In such a situation, Sanjay Gandhi needed to be together and he was Kamal Nath
 1975 main immergency ke baad se congress kharaab daur se guzar rahi thi
 Sanjay Gandhi had died prematurely during this period, Indira Gandhi's age was also not supporting her now
 congress lagaataar kamjor hoti gai
 Kamal Nath had come close to the Gandhi family, he was also working hard
 vah lagaataar party ke saath khadey hue the
 Indira Gandhi rewarded him when he was given a ticket from Chhindwara seat and cast in politics
 bas phir kya iske baad chhindwara kamalnath kaa ho gaya or kamalnath chhindwara ke
 He has been continuously winning elections from this seat ever since
 sirf ek baar unako is seat par haar mili he
 This area has become the stronghold of Kamal Nath
 vah is seat par tab bhi jite jab 2014 main congress ne ab tak kaa apana sabase kharaab pradarshan kiya
 Chhindwara voters have disappointed Kamal Nath only once when they lost in 1997 to former CM Sundar Lal Patwa
 1996 main kamalnath kii jagah unki patni chunaav ladi thim or jeet mili thi

 Pic Credit : jcstudio Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani said on Friday that President Pranab Mukherjee, not Rahul Gandhi, took the position on the controversial ordinance and Congress vice-president United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi only used image correction Did for apane blog par adwani ne likhaa ki cabinet dwaara daagi jan pratinidhiyon se sambandhit adhyadesh ko waapas lenaa samprag sarkaar ke ankarshak itihaas kaa ek or badsoorat adhyay he
 Advani said that most media reports have shown this entire incident as Rahul's victory
 isse saaf he ki aajkal media kitna satahi ho gaya he
 The comments adwani ne likhaa ki sonia ji ne chhavi sudhaar ke liye rahul kaa upyog kiya
 The objective of this task could have been fully fulfilled if Rahul had simply said that the decision taken by the government needs to be reviewed
 adwani ne kaha ki raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne congress ke mantriyon ko bulaakar adhyadesh ke prati apni aapattiyon kii jaankaree unhen di
 Returning the ordinance without a signature by the President would have been a major setback for the government
 isliye rahul gandhi ko is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye istemaal kiya gaya
 On his blog, Advani wrote that the withdrawal of the ordinance related to tainted public representatives by the cabinet is another ugly chapter in the unflattering history of the UPA government
 adwani ne kaha ki adhikansh media khabaron main is puri ghatana ko rahul kii jeet ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he
 This shows how superficial the media has become these days
 tippaniyan Advani wrote that Soniaji used Rahul for image correction
 is kaary kaa uddeshy puri tarah purna ho saktaa tha yadi rahul keval saadhaaran rup se kehete ki sarkaar dwaara liye gaye faisle kii samiksha kii jarurat he
 Advani said that President Pranab Mukherjee called the ministers of Congress and informed them about their objections to the ordinance
 raashtrapati dwaara bagaiyr hastakshar ke adhyadesh ko waapas kar dena sarkaar ke liye ek bahut bada jhatka sabit hota
 Hence Rahul Gandhi was used to fulfill this objective

 The impact of demonetisation is clearly visible in Bhadohi's carpet industry in this one month
 dhandhe kii raftaar kam ho gai he, kyonki paise kii vajah se nagad dihadi ke majdoor kaam par nahin aa rahe, jisase maal taiyaar nahin ho paaya
 The effect was even greater because it is their peak season
 janvari main videshon main lagane vaale expo ke liye jo kaaleen taiyaar ho rahe the, wo aadhe-adhure rah gaye, jisase inhen bada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 55-year-old Tanveer Hussain is one of Bhadohi's oldest exporters
 inkaa taqariban 12 karod rupee kaa salanaa turnover he, lekin wo aaj behad chintit he, kyonki janvari main lagane vaale sabase bade expo ke liye jo maal taiyaar karnaa tha, usamen se sirf do sample taiyaar hai, jabaki abhi 11 taiyaar hone ko baaki hai
 The comments tanwir kehete hai ki ye hamaara peak sijan he
 Some goods are being prepared, they are being delayed and due to which our shipment is being delayed
 janvari ke maah main chaahe germany ho yaa america, vahaan expo lagate hai
 There is a year-long order, but how will the work when the goods do not go
 tanwir kii tarah hi duusare exporter abdul rab hai
 Abdul Rab paid his artisans by check to get their goods ready
 isamen hi ek varkar naeem hai, jinaki pagaar 7,000 rupee he or unka acount kenra bank main he, lekin atm nahin he
 It took several days in line to withdraw the money received from the check, but could not get the money and in the meantime could not even come to work
 abdul rab bataate he kii bhadohi main takreeban 900 exporter hai, jo ek saal main lagbhag 7,000 karod kaa turnover karte hai or isse 15 lakh log jude hue hai, jo zyaadaatar card or cashlesh vyavastha ko nahin jaanate
 The final link in the carpet industry is that of the weavers who live in the village and make hand-knotted and handloom carpet, which is in great demand in the market
 inamen hi bunakar vijay or shyaam hai, jinaki unglia to notted kaaleen banane main lagi hai, lekin dimag paise par, kyonki inhen abhi inke maalik se bas kisi tarah khaanaa-khuraqi kaa hi paisa mil rahaa he
 So these people want that the money will come in the market soon, so that their work can go on
 55 saal ke tanwir hossain bhadohi ke sabase puraane exporter main se ek hai
 They have an annual turnover of about Rs 12 crore, but they are very worried today, because of the goods that were to be prepared for the biggest expo in January, only two samples are ready, while 11 are yet to be ready
 tippaniyan Tanveer says that this is our peak season

 Expo takes place in the month of January whether it is Germany or America

 Like Tanveer, the second exporter is Abdul Rab
 abdul rab ne apane maal ko taiyaar karaane ke liye apane kaarigaron ko check se pement kiya
 There is only one worker Naeem, who has a salary of Rs 7,000 and has an account with Canara Bank, but no ATM
 check se mili paise ko nikaalane ke liye kai din line main lage, lekin paisa nahin mil paaya or is bich kaam par bhi nahin aa paae
 Abdul Rab says that there are about 900 exporters in Bhadohi, who have a turnover of about 7,000 crores in a year and it has 1
5 million people, who mostly do not know about the card and cashless system
 kaaleen udyog kii antim kadi un bunakaron kii he, jo gaanv main rahete hai or haath se notted or handloom par kaaleen kii banaai karte hai, jinaki bazaar main maang bahut hoti he

 In the nineties, when poets like Gagan Gill, Anamika, Savita Singh and Katyayani came on the scene of contemporary Hindi poetry, they broke the male dominance in poetry
 hindi kavita kaa pasamanjar badalakar unhone purushon kii kavitaaon se alag shilp, bhashaa or vishay se hindi ko samrudh kiya tha
 After that in the 21st century, many poets like Nirmala Putul, Devyani Bhardwaj, Leena Malhotra Rao, Babusha Kohli gave a new dimension to female discourse
 is tarah samakaleen hindi kavita main stri swar kii pradhanta dikhaai padane lagi
 Due to this emergence, almost Bisexual poems are active these days
 ek do varsh ke bheetar bhi kai or kavyitriyon ke sangrah saamne aae hai jinamein anuraadhaa singh, sujatha, rashmi bharadwaj, swati shweta or prakruti kargeti bhi shaamil hai
 The first collections of all these young poets have been published nearby which have attracted the attention of contemporary poetry lovers
 ye kavyitriyaan soshal media par bhi sakriy hai or apane vichaar samay-samay par prakat bhi karatin hai tathaa samaaj main ghat rahi ghatnaon par tatkaal hastkshep bhi karatin hai
 These five poets have different colors and emotions of poetry, but one thing that is common is that they challenge patriarchy and call for the protection of their rights by freeing the woman from all forms of exploitation and women
 She also seeks true love in her life
 ve prem vivaah ke paaramparik arthon se alag nai paribhaashaayen bhi gadhati hai
 Anuradha Singh's collection of Needs to Sleep, Not God, presents the female discourse with a mature vision that underscores the woman's identity in a humble tone with deep impetus
 ve purush samaaj se yah prashn bhi karti hai ki kya chaahate ho stri se
 That is, the poet says in front of the men who expect all kinds of things from the woman, she says — she seeks a lover / lover hidden in you in every role / What do you want from a woman
 anuraadhaa apni kavita main yah bhi kahati hai ki striyon kaa dukh itnaa gaharaa he jise ve ab kisi se kahana bhi nahin chaahati hai, ve apni ladaai akele laduya chaahati hai
 They also despise the market and religion and political powers
 brahmasaty, main phir behatar thi, khurdabeen, sristi jo hamane rachi jaisi anek kavitaaon main anuraadhaa kii chintaaon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mahadevi Varma's neer-filled change has continued even today
 is arth main ve khud ko us parampara se bhi jodatii hai lekin unka yah dukh keval karunaa paidaa nahin karata balki pathak ko vichlit bhi karata he
 Anuradha's poem has a deep affinity as well as a loving affection for the readers
 unamem kisi tarah kaa koi pradarshan nahin he
 They compose poetry with solitude which has no noise or hurry
 unki kavita ke rajnatik arth bhi hai jo unke muhaavarey main najar aate hai par ve un rajnatik arthon ko kavyamay tareeke se kahati hai
 The title of his collection is a statement of contemporary politics, he wants sleep, not God
 ve dharm or rajya ke gathjod se paidaa hone vaali ashaanti se parichit hai isliye unhen neend chahie jo manushya ko gaharaa sukun detii he
 Anuradha's poem also gives readers a respite
 sujatha bhi anuraadhaa kii tarah mahanagareey samvednaa kii kavyitri hai par thodi bhinn
 The poem for him is in the midst of provisional silence
 par vahaan pratirodh bhi he
 The title of her poem is Resistance in which she expresses herself like a rock within a river
 unki ladaai ghar se hi shuru hoti he nnyonki ghar ek duswapn he
 They find love by removing this sand spread in the house
 dukh unke yahaan bhi he par karunaa jagaanaa unka uddeshy nahin
 Anuradha answers what she wants in her poem to a woman, Sujata gives her poem in the average woman
 ve kahati hai—tumhen chahie ek ausat aurat / na kam na zyada / bilkul namak kii tarah / uske jabaan hon / uske dil bhi hon / uske sapane hon
 
 
 Sujata is in favor of a perfect woman
 ve kahati bhi hai—deh or man ke ekalay ho jane kaa / durlabh kshan / jise lenaa / ho janaa ek sampurna stri
 In all these poems, there is an unbroken search for love beyond the body
 sujatha main ek adamya aatmavishvaas or sangharsh kii kaamana najar aati he
 She also challenges patriarchy with poetry like Nahi Marungi 
 unki kavita katyayani kii tarah nidar stri kii kavita he
 She also says - to make a roti round / it is necessary to have infinite patience / to become a woman
 sujatha kii yah kavita anamika kii kavitaaon kii yaad dilaati he jisamen stri ke anant dhairya kaa bakhaan he
 Rashmi Bhardwaj in her collection An Extra a unveils stories created in the society with women
 unki ek charchit kavita he charitraheen, jisamen ve us purush samaaj kii maansikta ko ujagar karti hai jisamen apane haq ke liye ladgaye vaali striyon ko charitraheen bataaya jaataa he
 Rashmi has also questioned this patriarchy like Anuradha and Sujatha
 unke sangrah main bhi prem ko lekar anek kavitaayen hai
 In the love of women, there is no body of love of male poets or Lipsa
 rashmi ne apni bhoomika main likhaa he, "meri lekhnee tabhi sarthak hogi agar meri bechaini, meri talash bas mujh tak nahin simat jaae
 Part of it reached you
 '' rashmi ke yahaan ishwar anuraadhaa ke ishwar se alag he
 He is not in a negative but positive sense
 ve kahati hai—bachapan ko rachate rahanaa jid he ishwar kii / 
 
 
 Childhood is the resistance to creation
 swati shweta apane sangrah ye din karfu ke hai main mulk kii vyathaa ko aakrosh or dukh ke saath likhti hai
 The language and idiom of his poetry are different from those of Anuradha, Rashmi and Sujatha
 ve samakaleen kavita kii mukhyadhara ke sweekrut shilp se alag shilp rachati hai isliye unamem vah hunar bhale na dikhe par ve apane kathy ko lekar sajag or mukhar hai or patibaddh bhi
 The war will continue
 In the poem, she speaks like Sujatha in a firm voice
 swati ke yahaan bhashaa thodi angadh he yaa yun kahen ki ve kathy ke dabaav main apni bhashaa par kam dhyaan detii hai
 Prakriti Kargeti is the youngest poetess of Hindi whose first collection has come to the city and complaints
 ve apni nai kavy bhashaa or shilp kii talash main hai
 But she also talks about giving the word form to the woman in her poems because the word itself has an expression
 unke yahaan to khamoshiyon ke bhi parade hai jinamein ve ankahi baton ko bhi khojane kaa prayaas karatin hai
 Sleep continued to float, now that we are not children, i do not respect you, inside the fetish and Ghalib arises from poems like from his grave there are signs of a potential poetess
 ye paanchon kavyitriyaan jivan ko khule dhang se abhivyakt karne kii pairvi karti hai
 This is the new woman's identity and new discussion

 agar aisa ho paata he to kohli and company ek or itihaas kaayam karegi
 Not only this, former captain Kapil Dev also favors Ravi Shastri
 wo kehete hai, 'series kaa nateeja kaafii kuch is baat par nirbhar karata he ki pich kisi banati he
 If the pitch is made according to South Africa, India will be difficult
 lekin agar bhartiya team ke hisaab se pich banegi to ham jeet sakate hai
 ' mohali test ab do din dur khadaa he
 After the defeat in the T20 and ODI series, at least one thing is being considered before the Test - that the Indian team management does not want to make any concession on the pitch
 lekin sabko ye bhi maaloom he ki saamne he duniya kii number van team - aise main bade daawey bhi nahin kiye ja rahe
 That is, the players will get the turning track in the Mohali Test, this thing is almost certain
 team management ke saath kai purv cricketer or exparts maanate hai ki isamen koi galat baat bhi nahin he
 The home team gets the benefit of the home ground
 mehmaan dakshin africa team ko is baat kaa acchhee tarah andaaza he ki duniya main number 1 team hone ke baavjood bhartiya pich or halaat unke liye chunauteepurn sabit ho sakate hai

 The Mohali test now stands two days away
 tii20 or vanade series main haar ke baad test se pehle kam se kam ek baat tay maani ja rahi he - ki bhartiya team management pich ko lekar koi riyaayat nahin baratna chaahati
 But everyone also knows that the world's number one team is in front - big claims are not being made in such a situation
 yani mohali test main khilaadiyon ko terning trek hi milegaa, ye baat qareeb-qareeb tay ho gai he
 Many former cricketers and experts with team management believe that there is nothing wrong in this
 gharelu team ko gharelu maidan kaa faaydaa miltaa hi he
 The visiting South African team is well aware that despite being the No
1 team in the world, the Indian pitch and conditions can prove challenging for them
 unki ek badi mushkil ye he ki bharat ke number 1 spinner aar

 While Ravi Shastri says that Ashwin is bowling brilliantly and if the South African team focuses on Ashwin, then the two remaining spinners of the team can surprise him
 team diarector ravi shastri is baat par jor dete rahe hai ki team india kii ausat umr qareeb 25 saal he or ye team sakaaratmak cricket khelkar jeet hasil karne kii koshish karegi
 If this happens, Kohli & Co

 The Congress lashed out at the Kejriwal government for two innocent girls at Samaypur Badli in Delhi
 congress kii pravaktasharmishtha mukherjee kejariwal sarkaar ko sirf vaah wahi karne vaala netaa bataa diya
 In fact, Sheila Dixit government had created 103 general resource centers for social services in Delhi
 lekin ab ye band ho chuke hai
 The purpose of these centers was to make society aware of women and girls and work at ground level
 lekin kejariwal sarkaar isi saal isko band kar diya
 Congress spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee asked the question that if the Kejriwal government was to close a social awareness resource center about women, then what other option did it work on
 sharmishtane kaha ki ek taraf sarkaar mahilaon or ladakiyon kii suraksha ko bayaanbaji kar rahi he to duusari taraf mahilaon or ladakiyon ke hiton main chalane vaale centre ko bina soche samajhe band bhi kar detii he
 Congress raised the question that after all how much publicity was advertised through women to remove social inequality, the government is doing its own thing only through advertisements but is not taking any steps to remove social inequality
 to vahiin shila dikshit sarkaar ke samay bane 103 centreo ko bina soche samajhe band kar diya

 lekhak bhartiya nausena ke purv pramukh hai*** In the by-election in Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aditya Nath's stronghold Gorakhpur, the alliance (samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Nishad Party) defeated the BJP heavily
 is baar bhi gathbandhan apni jeet kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Yogi Adityanath is also very alert after the defeat
 nishad party ko apane paale main karne se lekar abhinayta ravikishna ko tikat dekar unki lokapriyata ke jariye matadaataaon ko apane paale main laane tak har sambhav prayaas bhaajapa ne kiya

 On this question, the Nishad Party is now with the BJP

 But this time the party has worked fiercely on both factors

 But the question arises that will the factor of Ravikishan's outwardness not come in the way of his victory? On this, Agarwal says, "firstly they are not outsiders
 Secondly their popularity will go in our favor

 Baba Ramdev, forcibly moved from New Delhi, has resumed his fast at his ashram here and says that until the central government agrees to his demand to end corruption and bring back black money, his The 'satyagraha' will continue
 patanjali yogapith sutron ne bataaya ki baba ramdev apane samarthakon or anuyaayiyon ke saath kal der raat yogapith kii yajyashala main satyagrah par baithe
 After the police crackdown against supporters in Delhi, the yoga guru tried to launch his satyagraha in Noida yesterday but he was not allowed to enter Uttar Pradesh
 mujffarnagar jile kii seemaa par buraahari police chaowkee par adhikariyon ne unhen roka or uttarakhand waapas jane ko kaha
 Later Ramdev returned to Patanjali Yogpeeth and started his fast late at night
 yoga guru ne kaha ki jab tak bhrashtachar khatm karne or kaale dhan ko waapas laane kii unki maang centre sarkaar maan nahin leti, tab tak unka ‘satyagrah’ jari rahegaa
 Ramdev said yesterday, 'no one should violate the law and therefore i am not going to Delhi
 mujhe uttar pradesh ke noida jane kii bhi anumati nahin di gai
 Now this (fast) will be here
 ’ unhone kaha ki sarkaar unhen dilli aane se 15 se 30 dinon se zyada nahin roak sakati or vah jald hi rashtriya rajdhani jaaenge
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank met the yoga guru last evening and assured him that if Ramdev wants to continue his fast, he will be given full support and full security
 uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri or congress ke varisht netaa en di tiwari bhi baba ramdev se milane ke liye yogapith gaye or unke prati samarthan jataayaa
 The Uttarakhand unit of the BJP has announced that it will celebrate 'black Day' today in all the district headquarters of the state to protest against the police action against Baba Ramdev and his supporters
 yogapith sutron ne bataaya ki agar baba ke saath anshan karne waalon kii sankhya badhati he to is duusare charan main satyagrah patanjali yogapith ke bade sabhaagaar main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Police said that keeping in view the plans of the protests of various groups, the entire state has been put on high alert
 ‘gujarat ke ankhon kaa tara he-saputara, is hill stesan par baat karne ke liye koi nahin he sivaae badalon ke’ye ek line us ek minute paanch second ke aid film se lee gai he, jo amitabh bachchan ne gujarat tourism ke liye shoot kiya he
 There is no doubt that Saputara is the eye of Gujarat
 ek aam gujarati yaa khaskar suuratvasi ke liye daang jile main sthit yah hill stesan unke liye vickend main masti luutane kaa adda he
 Picnic spot
 ho bhi kyon naa jab yah gujarat kaa akelaa hill stesan he
 But for 270 Dang families living in Nawagaon, a short distance from Saputara, this place changes its meaning
 inke liye saputara us tis kii tarah he, jo saalon inke bheetar uth rahaa he
 It is like that palace, which was built on their land, without their will and now all these people serve that palace
 1970 se pehle saputara or navagaanv kaa namonishaan nahin tha
 The same name was -junagaon
 junagaanv main tab daang adivaasiyon ke 42 ghar the or wo vahaan aaraam se rahete the
 But in the year 1970 these 42 Dang families were removed from there and then came into existence, Saputara
 yah he us maanviya vinaash se sthapit khokhli vikaas yatra
 With this, the existence of Junagaon ceased to exist and the Dang tribes living there settled a little further away from what was called, Nawagaon
 sawaal yah uthta he ki saalon se rah raheadivaasiyonko jab unke jameen se hataaya gaya to kis tarah se? kya unase unki sahamati lee gai? kya unhen sammanpurvak tareeke se vahaan se hataaya gaya? yaa phir adivasee vahaan se hatane ke liye khud hi taiyaar ho gaye the? un sabhi adivaasiyon ko hataane se pehle kahaan basaane kii yojana thi? wo aaj kahaan-kin halaaton main ji rahe hai?in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab ratan bhai hari bhai gangulake de rahe hai
 Because they have seen the time when this displacement took place
 hari bhai ko hindi nahin aati
 He puts his point in Dangi dialect, which has been translated into Hindi by a boy from Basti
 wo kehete hai, ‘hamen jab hataaya gaya tha to barish kaa mausam tha
 We did not want to get up from there; At that time, not many people were educated, so they had taken the thumb impression most forcefully and then the police came and forcefully broke our house and removed us
 us visthaapan main congress kii sarkaar thi or hitendra kanhaiyalaal desai mukhyamantri the
 The change of power took place and the Bharatiya Janata Party has been in power in the state for a long time now
 vartmaan pradhanmantri narendra modi rajya main sabase adhik samay tak mukhyamantri rahe
 During this time all the equations changed
 sthitiyaan badal gayi
 Sapatara developed rapidly as a tourist destination, but what has not changed is the status of the displaced tribals
 kabhi kheti-kisaani karne vaale ye daang adivasee aaj maharashtra main jaakar angoor kii kheti main mazdooree karte hai
 In Saputara, we put a cart or go to a big hotel to sing folk songs or perform folk dances
 inhen se inke ghar kaa chulhaa jalataa he
 They have 270 families in Nawagaon and out of 311 villages in the entire district, this is the only village which does not have any land for farming
 jis jameen par ye philhal based hai, us par bhi inkaa adhikaar nahin he
 Since the displacement, these people have been demanding from the government that at least the land where they are living should be given in their name, but they have not been successful so far
 raamu bhai kehete hai, ‘ham sarkaar se zyada kahaan maang rahe hai
 They are asking for a house to live and a little land to eat and earn
 lekin itnaa bhi nahin mil rahaa he
 On the contrary, another government notice was received a few years ago, asking to vacate this land too
 kyonki touriston ke liye sarkaar yahaan park bananaa chaah rahi he
 'some people of this community had also met Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the year 2012 for their demand and they had assured that they would do something for Nawagaon
 us bare main ramchandra chiman hads bataate hai, ‘ham gaye the milane
 i met Modi ji in front of him
 unhone ek letters bhi diya tha
 Said that work will be done
 file chalegi, lekin aaj tak kahaan kuch hua? pataa nahin file kahaan chal rahi he?in pariwaron tak bijli pahunchati he
 Reaches the internet
 lekin inke gharon main shauchalay nahin he
 The reason for this is said by local journalist Hemant, 'see, there is no land in any of these names
 kaagaj main yah koi gaanv he hi nahin
 Now in such a situation, neither do they get the benefit of the scheme of making them toilet, nor do they have enough money to make them toilet

 With the victory of JDU candidate Mohit Prakash, it has now been proved that the BJP was completely disillusioned with the strategy that Prashant Kishore had adopted to win the Patna University Students' Union to his party
 patna vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh chunaav main prashanth kishor kii pratishtha daanv par lagi thi
 Because after joining the party and becoming the vice-president, this was the first election in which he had to show his power

 JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh also attacked the BJP after the election results and said that the manner in which four BJP mlas sat on a dharna at Pirbhor police station against Prashant Kishore and arrested Prashant Kishore in violation of the code of conduct This bet of demand turned upside down for them
 jadyu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki bijepi ghamandi party he
 Sanjay Singh completely denied that Prashant Kishore interfered in the election in favor of JDU
 unhone kaha ki agar unhone chunavi prakriya main hastkshep kiya hota to jadyu paanchon siton par jeet hasil karti
 Sanjay Singh said that the BJP is uneasy about the fact that it dominates in urban areas, but there too the JDU candidate has won
 duusari taraf, bijepi vidhayak nitin naveen ne kaha he ki abivipi ne chaatr sangh chunaav main 3 siten apane dam par or vipareet sthiti main jiti hai

 Our government wants to change the life of the farmer by giving Rajasthan a cold chain and new technology
 kisaan ne narendra modi ko shakti dikhaai, ab duniya ko dikhaanaa he
 He said, the farmers of India should not play on the backfoot
 main chahta hum ki hindustan kaa yuva, kisaan frontroot par khele or chhakke maare
 Narendra Modi has played on the backfoot so far but we will not do so
 ' rahul ne kaha, 'hindustan ke yuva ko kisi se darane kii jarurat nahin

 On Wednesday, Congress has a victory rally at the Vidyadhar Nagar Stadium in Jaipur, with a target to bring 2 lakh farmers
 mana ja rahaa he ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav prachaar kaa aagaaj rahul gandhi jaipur se karenge
 Although the capacity of the stadium is being told from 50 thousand to 60 thousand

 Such farmer rally will be organized across the country on behalf of Congress

 Farmers do not have money for farming, but the Modi government at the Center does not want to waive loans to farmers

 Congress national president Rahul Gandhi will go public with this matter

 yah modi sarkaar kaa ek or jumala he, iske sivaa kuch bhi nahin he

 Uddhav Thackeray, who wanted to fulfill the promise made to Balasaheb, broke Uddhav's dream by forming a government with the BJP
 Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wants to fulfill the promise made to his father, Balasaheb Thackeray, in which he will one day send a Shiv Sena to Maharashtra
 There was talk of making Chief Minister
 balasaheb ke sapane ko saakaar karne liye uddhav thakare ne bijepi se 25 saal puraani dosti ko todakar apane virdohi ensipi-congress ke saath haath mila liya
 The Shiv Sena would stake claim to form the government on Saturday, but before that Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar broke the NCP and shattered Balasaheb's dream
 darasal, shivasena ko ummid thi ki bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye congress-ensipi use tatkaal samarthan de dengi, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Formation of the government was decided only after several rounds of meetings with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray with congress-ncp leaders
 shuukravaar shaam saarvjaanik rup se kaha gaya ki uddhav thakare paanch saal ke liye siem banenge or shanivaar ko 12
 At 30, the leaders of the three parties will meet the governor and stake claim to form the government
 shivasena-congress-ensipi netaaon kii shuukravaar shaam ko hui baithak ke baad congress netaa manikraav thakare ne kaha tha ki yah lagbhag final ho gaya he kimaharashtraka aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena se hoga
 The NCP had never demanded the post of CM
 udhar, shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha tha ki maharashtra main ensipi-congress or shivasena kii gathbandhan sarkaar main puure 5 saal tak shivasena kaa hi mukhyamantri hoga
 In this way Balasaheb's dream seemed to be coming true
 ajit pavaar ne badla maharashtra kaa siyaasi khelmaharashtra main kingmekar banakar ubhare sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne raturaat aisa khel kiya ki maharashtra kaa siyaasi game hi palat gaya
 Shiv sena-ncp-congress kept making plans to form a government together and Ajit Pawar formed a government with BJP
 ajit pavaar ensipi vidhayak dal ke netaa hai
 In such a situation, he also had the letter of support signed by the legislative parties
 aise main unhone sharad pavaar sahit tamaam ensipi netaaon ko peeche chhodte hue bijepi ko samarthan dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari administered the oath of office to Chief Minister and Ajit Pawar as Deputy CM to Devendra Fadnavis at 8 am on Saturday
 haalanki sharad pavaar ne kaha ki yah ensipi kaa samarthan nahin he
 At the same time, Supriya Sule said that the family and the party have broken up
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki ajit pavaar ne ensipi ko todakar sarkaar banane main kaamyaab ho gaye hai
 But the real test is yet to be held in the house
 maharashtra main fadanvis-ajit pavaar kii sarkaar banane ke saath hi uddhav thakare ke mukhyamantri banane ke armaanon par pani phir gaya he
 This is the reason why Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Ajit Pawar had gone out on the pretext of meeting the lawyer
 satta or paise ke dam par puraa khelaa hua he
 Ajit Pawar was unable to see
 andhere main ajit pavaar ne daaka daalaa he
 Ajit Pawar and his comrades have maligned Chhatrapati Shivaji's name

 The India Today Education Summit 2015, held in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, drew attention to the changes and needs coming in the field of education
 summit ko sarkari or nijee kshetra samet glamer duniya kii kai hastiyon ne bhi sambodhit kiya
 The squeeze of the speakers came out that for the betterment of education sector, the government and private sector will have to work together
 summit main shiksha se jude paanch vishyon par diggajon ne apni raay rakhi
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that education is not a business but a mission and everyone has the right
 unhone bataaya ki pradesh sarkaar is disha main aage badhate hue kamjor virgon se aane vaale chaatro ko sansaadhan uplabdh karvaa rahi he
 He also stressed the need for government and private sector to work together
 nijee kshetra par gairajaruri dabaav nahinchauhan ne summit main shiksha ke kshetra ke nijee khiladiyon kaa hausala bhi badhaayaa
 He clearly said that it would be too much to expect from the private sector that free education will be made available to all on its behalf, or to expect the student not to recover the expenditure on education
 isliye pradesh sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki nijee collejon main pard rahe garib chaatro kii puri fees bhi vah khud degi
 "students have to take loans from the bank because of the fees of vocational education," he said
 kai baar garib pariwaron ke chaatro ko bank lone isliye nahin mil paata kyonki unke abhibhavak bank guarantee nahin de pate
 Therefore, we have made arrangements in the state that the State Government will take loan guarantee for these children
 aisa karne se sarkaar par badi sankhya main takneekee ucch shikshan santhaan kholane kaa baari kharch turant nahin aayega
 Urban Administration and Development Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, who was present on the occasion, said that Madhya Pradesh is emerging as a new center of education
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki shiksha ke vistaar ke saath hi uski gunvattta ke kaary bhi kiye jaaen
 The government has been openly accepting the participation of private investors, their cooperation and suggestions in these efforts
 unhone kaha, ''pehle videshon main bhopal kii pahchaan gas traasadee kii ghatana se hoti thi
 But in the last nine years, due to the efforts of the state government, a new identity of the state has been created
 ab log kehete hai ki madhya pradesh vah rajya he jahaan kaa mukhyamantri aam aadmi ke rup main janakalyaan ke kaary kar rahaa he
 "promoting the private, rein also the need to promote the private sector in the field of education" All the speakers were unanimous
 'shiksha ke kshetra main saarvajanik-nijee bhaagidaari' vishay par satr main pradesh ke ucch shiksha mantri umashankar gupta ne kaha, ''sarkaar shiksha ke kshetra main thos prayaas kar rahi he taaki bachche duusare bade shaharon kaa rukh na karen
 However, at the same time, he also stressed the need for control in education and said that if this is not done then it will start arbitrary
 gupta ne kaha ki shiksha aisa kshetra he jahaan nirantar sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa he or yah kaam chand saal main nahi kiya ja saktaa
 He also said, "I am not satisfied with the education provided by public-private partnership (PPP)
 isamen abhi kaaphi kuch karne kii jarurat he
 "(actress Swara Bhaskar at Education Summit) Government's responsibility will not be less, the private sector can do value addition in the field of education or health but 90 percent work will have to be done by the government," said Principal Secretary (health) Praveer Krishna
 
 unhone kaha, ''ni:shulk seva gunvattta ke saath kaise uplabdh karaaen yah sarkaar ke liye chunauti he
 It is the intention of both the central and state government to provide quality service to the people
 ''isi satr main shaamil eiesisiti uniwarsity ke chancelar santosh kumaar choube ne bataaya ki pehle soochna praudyogiki kii padhai sirf angreji main hoti thi lekin desh main pehali baar hamane hindi main iske course shuru kiye
 This benefited the children of small towns, who were unable to study IT because of not knowing English
 choube ne kaha, ''aaj anya pradeshon ke bachche bhi madhya pradesh main padhai karne aa rahe hai
 Children from 19 states are studying in our university itself
 '' unhone pipipi ke madhyam se innovations par jor diya
 Apart from education, education is the first step of the Bhikariar
 summit main glamer or cricket kii duniya ke jane-maane chehron ne bhi apane anubhav saajha kiye
 On the subject of 'education — another aspect of academics', Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association chief coach and former Indian cricketer Ameya Khorasia said that education should not be made a business
 unhone kaha, ''jarurat he ki aap main junun ho
 We should always make every effort to fulfill our dreams
 '' tanu vaids manu or ranjhna fame abhinetri swara bhaskar ne is baat par jor diya ki bollywood jab theatre ko mauka degaa tabhi tasviir badalegi
 He said, "granted, not everyone can become Deepika or Shahrukh but everyone should work hard in their own way
" '' abhinayta saurabh shukla ne dil kholkar apni baat rakhi
 He told, "I used to be a very bad student
 aakhirkaar tang aakar post grajuation main thaan liya ki ab mujhe abhinay ke kshetra main hi janaa he
 In this way i went into a completely different field, which was not under any university
 ''shukla ne sensorship se jude dheron sawaalon kaa jawaab kuch yun diya, ''keechad main hi camel ugta he
 If you want to show lotus then you have to show mud
 agar aap filmon main apshabdon ko katate hai to hindi sahitya kii kai acchhee kitaaben bain kerani padengi jaise kaashi kaa assi
 "first Need Quality" Additional Chief Secretary Aruna Sharma stressed on the quality of education
 'shiksha-kaushal vikaas, rojgaar nirmaan' vishay par unhone kaha ki saikadon aise shikshan santhaan khul rahe hai jahaan se nikal rahe bachche kisi kaam ke nahin hote
 There is a need to control such institutions
