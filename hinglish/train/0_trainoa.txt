 biryani kise nahin pansad! chikan biryani, matan biryani, veg biryani, soya biryani or aig biryani, aisi tamaam verieti main milane valeeis biryani ke log diwane hai
 Imagine if you got this biryani in the temple as a prasad? Yes, there is a temple in South India where mutton biryani is fed as Prasad
 yahaan hazaron kii sankhya main log biryani khaane aate hai
 Biryani is being fed to people as prasad in the village of Vadakkampatti in Madurai, Tamil Nadu since 1937
 ye biryani muniyaandi hotel mandir main khilaataa he
 Actually, Gurusamy Naidu started the Muniyandi Hotel in the name of Muniyandi, the local deity of this village
 phir ek ke baad ekamuniyaandi naam se baaki logon ne bhi hotel khole
 All these hotels are known to feed their customers delicious non-veg

 modi sarkaar ke aitihaasik kadam notebandi ke 3 saal puure8 november, 2016 ko notebandi ke elaan se bhounchakka rah gaya tha deshpiem modi ke is kadam kii kisi ko bhanak nahin lagane pai thinotbandi ke teen saal puure ho chuke hai
 There are different claims about its success and failure, but everyone is unanimous on one thing, that is the tremendous success of keeping it confidential
 piem modi ne 8 november, 2016 ke apane aitihaasik sambodhan se pehle apane kuch chuninda afasaron ko chhodkar desh main kisi ko bhanak nahin lagane di
 For the historic step like demonetisation, the Prime Minister selected some of his trusted officers, who were less known in the financial circles of the country
 koun log the piem modi kii gopneey team kaa hissapiem modi ke is kadam se raturaat desh kii 86 fisadi nakadi ko bekaar ho gai thi or arthvyavastha mushkil main pahunch gai thi
 The then revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia along with five other people who were aware of this, kept it highly confidential
 piem modi ke saath saath yuva researchrs kii ek team thi jo pradhanmantri karyaalay main hi baithkar kaam karti thi
 According to a report in the Economic Times in 2016, the head of the finance ministry, Adhia, was monitoring this entire campaign with the support of the backroom team
 adhiya saal 2003 se 2006 tak narendra modi ke pramukh sachiv rah chuke hai, jab modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, isliye unka modi se bahut hi kareebi rishta he
 When an issue had to be discussed in depth, the two used to talk among themselves in Gujarati
 kyon jaruri thi gopneeyatayah gopneeyata isliye behad jaruri thi, taaki pehle se jaankaree hasil kar sandigdh log sona, property yaa anya koi asset kharidkar apane kaale dhan ko thikaane na laga len
 The research team, under Adhia's supervision, fully prepared its theoretical blueprint
 is team main data or financial analysis ke yuva export the, to kuch aise yuva bhi jo modi ke soshal media account or smartphone ap kaa kaamkaaj sambhalate hai
 Elections were going to be held in UP next year and some BJP leaders were afraid that the party might not suffer the loss, but Narendra Modi said in a cabinet meeting called shortly before the announcement of demonetisation, 'I completed Have done research in this way, if it fails then blame me
 'saal bhar pehle se chal rahi thi taiyaarinarendra modi kii bijepi sarkaar kaa sabase bada vaayada kaale dhan ko waapas laane kaa tha,isliye sarkaar par kuch bada kadam uthaane kaa dabaav tha
 a year ago, Modi brainstormed with the finance ministry, central bank officials and several think tanks on how to take action on black money
 isamen modi ne in sawaalon par jawaab maange the ki desh main kitni teji se nae note print kiye ja sakate hai, unka vitaran kaise hota he, yadi saarvajanik bainkon main kaaphi rakam jamaa ho jaae to unhen kya phayda hoga or notebandi se kise phayda hoga?haalanki yah saare sawaal alag-alag tareeke se puche gaye the taaki koi is baat kaa andaja na laga paae ki sarkaar aisa karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 In fact, the government kept a lot of secrecy about it because if this information was leaked in any way, then this whole exercise would have been meaningless
 sadiyon se apni har samasya ke liye gram devataaon kii choukhat par mattha techne vaali bastar kshetra kii janajatiyaan jan apekshaaon kii kasuti par khare nahin utarane vaale devi-devataaon ko bhi dandit karne kaa jajba rakhte hai
 This punishment can also be in the form of economic fines, temporary suspension or a farewell from forever
 yah sab hota he janata kii adaalat main
 Every year the Bhado Jarta festival is celebrated in Keshkal town of Bastar district with great pomp and show
 yahaan kii bhangaraam devi ilaake ke nau pargana ke 55 rajasav gram main sthapit ek hajaar se bhi adhik gram devi-devataaon kii pramukh aradhy devi hai
 On the last Saturday of Bhado month, all the deities are present at the rate of all Bhangaram Devi
 yahaan ke pujari saraju ram gaur bataate hai ki isse pehle devi bhangaraam kii seva puja lagaataar chah shanivaar tak hoti he
 This year Bhado Jarta month festival is being held on 23 and 24 August in Keshkal
 padhaare devi-devataaon kaa paramparanusaar swaagat kar unhen pad or pratishtha ke anuroop sthaan diya jaataa he
 The priest, Gayata, Sirha, village head, Manjhi, Mukhiya and Patel arrive with them as representatives

 To keep the deities happy and calm, they will be offered sacrifices and other gifts as per customary
 bina manyata ke kisi bhi nae dev kii puja kaa praavdhaan yahaan nahin he
 According to the need or on the demand of the villagers, new deities are also recognized here
 kshetra ke naagarik magaraj goyal ke mutabik, doshi paae gaye yaa tehraae gaye devataaon ko bhi alp maatra main shulk adaa karnaa padataa he
 An example of communal harmony is also found in Bhado Jarta
 bhangaraam devi ke mandir ke sameep doctor khan dev naamak devtaa bhi maujuud hai, jin par sabhi nau pargana ke nivaasiyon ko bimariyon se bachaae rakhane kii jimmedaari he
 Experts say that years ago there were some doctors in the area who used to treat the sick with full service and selflessness
 un ke na rahane par unki seva bhaavana ke kaaran unhen yahaan kii janata ne dev rup main sweekaar kar liya or unki bhi puja kii jane lagi
 While other gods and goddesses are sacrificed as an offering, Doctor Khan Dev is offered egg and lemon
 sthaneey nivasee krishnadutt upaadhyaay bataate hai ki ilaake main beemaari kaa prakope hone par sabase pehle doctor khan dev kii hi puja hoti he
 The puja-archana that began on Saturday evening lasts till late in the night, and begins on Sunday morning, a unique example of its unique religious and karmic tribal heritage throughout the world

 Their power is also assessed from time to time
 akarmanya or gaiyr jimmedaar devi-devataaon ko safai kaa mauka diya jaataa he, or jan adaalat main unhen sajaa bhi sunai jaati he
 There is no one else to punish the deities but only their devotees
 gauratlab he ki bhangaraam devi ke ilaake kii pramukh devi hone ke baavjood jorta utsav main mahilaon kaa pravesh or prasad grahan sarvatha varjit he
 According to Sirha Roop Singh Mandavi of Narna village, if women are emotional, then the decisions taken against the deities in the court of Jowarta against the gods can be adversely affected
 kohkameta ke sirahaa nathulal thakur kehete hai ki sachai yah bhi he ki vikaas or suvidhaon ke abhaav main yahaan ke aadimajan apni samasyaon ko lekar inhen devi-devataaon kii alokik shaktiyon ke sahare aaj tak ji rahe hai, baavjood iske unki soch kaaphi gahari he
 There is also a provision for the return of the deities to be punished, but their stages can only be fortified if they pledge to prioritize public welfare works in the future by correcting their mistakes
 yah vachan sajaa paae devi-devtaa sambandhit pujari ko swapn main aakar dete hai
 Balram Gaur, a resident of Keshakal, said that after the completion of this process, God is given a new form

 '- input bhashaa RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's advice is the demise of selfless man, but people do not leave RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has given advice on the ongoing fight between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki sab jaanate hai ki swaarth bahut kharaab baat he, lekin apane swaarth ko bahut kam log chhodte hai
 Take the example of country or of individuals
 nagpur main ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue sangh pramukh ne kaha ki sabhi manushya jaanate hai ki prakruti ko nasht karne se ham nasht ho jaaenge
 But the work of destroying nature did not stop
 sab jaanate hai ki aapas main jhagada karne se donon kii haani hoti he, lekin aapas main jhagada karne kii baat abhi tak band nahin hui
 In the context of Maharashtra, Mohan Bhagwat's talk is being linked to this statement of the RSS chief with the ongoing battle over the politics of Maharashtra
 bataa den ki maharashtra kii raajnneeti main saalon tak mitra rahe shivasena or bijepi kii raahen juda ho chuki he
 Shiv Sena is now preparing to form a government with the Congress and NCP here
 unka bayaan bijepi-shivasena ke isi jhagade kii ore ishaara karata hua dikh rahaa he
 The head of selfishness, the non-union chief Mohan Bhagwat, gave a message at an event held in Nagpur, 'everyone knows that destroying nature will destroy us too, but the course of destroying nature has not stopped
 sabhi jaanate hai ki aapas main jhagada karne se ek paksh nahin balki donon ko haani hoti he lekin jhagade phir bhi nahin ruke
 Bhagwat did not stop here
 He also said that everyone knows that selfishness is the demerit of man, but there are very few people who give up selfishness, whether it is of the country or of individuals

 How politics is becoming a part of an event management, its Mujahira was clearly seen in Panchalhari Kritapura village of Rudrapur block, 35 km from up's Deoria district headquarters
 6 sitambar kii subah aath baje kaali tii-shart or neeli genes pahane chah yuvaaon kaa ek jhund gaanv ke kuch kisaan pariwaron se baatcheet karne main tallin tha
 SPG personnel guarded by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi were strictly against Congress leaders wearing white kurta pajamas, but the youth wearing black T-shirts and blue jeans were allowed to go anywhere
 ye chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor (pike) kii team ke sadsy the jo kareeb do ghante baad rahul ke panchaldhi pahunchane se pehle sari taiyaariyaan durust kar lenaa chaahate the
 At exactly half past ten, Rahul's helicopter landed on the field helipad outside the village
 rahul ne ek-ek karke panchaldhi ke kisaan hans kumaar, sadsy singh, pradhyumna singh or vimala ke ghar pahunchakar unki takaliphen sunin
 At the time when he was meeting the peasant families, people were angry in the Dalit colony situated on one side of the village
 inhen main se ek 40 varshiya ramaasre bhi the jo snaatak hone ke baavjood mazdooree karke apane parivaar kaa pet paalate hai
 He says, "rahul Gandhi only met the people of Sainthwar (backward caste) in Panchladhi
 daliton kii basti kii ore jhaanka hi nahin
 After this, Rahul started the Kisan Mahayatra
 ek khaas tarah se taiyaar kii gai volvo bas par savaar hokar ve rudrapur-karahkol maarg par kareeb 15 kilometre chalane ke baad dopaher kareeb saadhe baarah baje sataasi inter college, rudrapur pahunche
 Around 2,000 footpaths were laid on the college grounds under the supervision of the members of Team PK
 jaise hi rahul kaa kafila khaat sabha main shirkat karne ke liye bich main bane manch par pahunchaa sabhi log apni charpaayiyon par khadey ho gaye
 The Khat Sabha was to be held by Rahul, but for more than half an hour, local MLA Akhilesh Pratap Singh and UP Congress in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad kept giving speeches before the farmers
 sava baje jab rahul kii baari ai to subah se intjaar kar rahe kisaanon ke saamne unhone 11 minute main apana bhaashan nibata diya
 In this unique khat gathering started with the brainchild of Team PK, Rahul completely failed to create the kind of atmosphere among the farmers as he had done before the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government of the state in Bhatta Parsaul before the 2012 assembly elections
 Was made against
 apane puure bhaashan main rahul centre kii narendra modi sarkaar par to jamkar barase par pradesh kii samaajawaadee party (sapa) sarkaar or bispi par chuppi saadhe rahe
 This is the reason why Rahul's speeches in the Khat Sabha did not make as much headlines as the plunder of the four-legged after the meeting caught attention
 29 july ko lakhanu main rahul gandhi ke ramp par chalakar kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet karne vaale kaarykram kii tarah khaat sabha main bhi team pike kaa bhavy event management saaf jhalak rahaa tha par yah rahul ko kisaan netaa ke rup main sthapit nahin kar pai
 In his speech in front of the farmers, Rahul also used more English words
 jab unhone kheti main laagat kii baat kii to use baar-baar 'iconmi' kaha
 The manner in which Team PK has transformed Rahul's 'kisan Yatra' from Deoria to Delhi covering 225 assembly constituencies and covering a total distance of 2,500 km has increased the challenges of the Congress
 khaat sabha, ramp par chalakar kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet jaise team pike ke abhinav prayogon ke chalate sthaneey or jamini pakad rakhane vaale congressi netaaon kii upeksha party ke liye sukhad sanket nahin de rahi he
 More than 15 members of Prashant Kishore's team encamped at different places two days before the start of the Kisan Mahayatra from Rudrapur in Deveradia, Team PK
 panchaldhi main rahul gandhi se milwane ke liye kisaan pariwaron kaa chayan karne kaa jimmaa bhi team pike kaa hi rahaa
 Local leaders are feeling marginalized as Team PK gets more attention in Congress programs
 pradesh congress kaaryakarini main shaamil rahe devaria ke ek kisaan netaa bataate hai, ''team pike ke sadasyon ne kisaanon ke ghar jaakar unki takaliphen suni or unhen rahul gandhi tak pahunchaaya
 Local leaders were sidelined in this whole exercise
 rahul gandhi ke jane ke baad team pike ke sadsy bhi chale gaye
 Whom should the farmer find now? "the growing interference of Prashant Kishore and his members in the UP Congress has led to some big leaders being vocal
 kareeb do hakrate pehle banda se congressi vidhayak vivek singh ke phone par raat 11 baje team pike ke ek sadsy ne phone karke unase unke vidhansabha kshetra 'bandra' (asal main bundelkhand kaa banda vidhansabha kshetra) ke bare main jaankaree maangi
 Vivek Singh, hurt by the arbitrariness of the members of the team PK who do not know the name of the assembly area properly, has complained to the senior leaders of the members of the PK team
 pichley maheene bijepi main shaamil hue saharanpur ke vidhayak pradeep choudhary kehete hai, ''congress main puraane jamini netaaon kii salaah ko darkinar kar team pike ko hi tavajjo di ja rahi he
 This is causing dissatisfaction among senior leaders
 '' haalanki pradesh congress ke mukhya pravaktaa satyadev treepathi prashanth kishor or unke sadasyon kii karypranali par uth rahe sawaalon ko nakaarte karte hue ise vipakshi partiyon kii ek chaal bataate hai
 In the next assembly elections, BJP and SP have used the chariots to gain control over remote areas
 ab congress bhi rathon ke jariye ladi ja rahi ladaai main kud padi he
 Prashant Kishore has prepared 250 'chariot chariots' specifically for UP under his supervision
 'karj maaf, bijli bill half, samarthan mulya kaa karo hisaab' jaise naare likhe rath har us vidhansabha kshetra main pahunchenge jahaan rahul gandhi jaaenge
 These chariots have specially prepared worker guides, door stickers, mobile stickers and demand letters to be filled with farmers
 congress pravaktaa surendra rajput bataate hai, ''ye rath har vidhansabha ke gaanv-gaanv jaakar party kii nitiyon kii jaankaree to denge hi saath main aisa maahaul bhi banaaenge jisase kisi ilaake kaa congress ke prati samarthan saaf jaahir ho
 "to reach out to the common people, the Congress will fill up the demand letter from the people in the assembly constituencies on the way during Rahul Gandhi's" Deoria to Delhi "visit
 is maang patr main kisaanon kaa naam, pataa or mobile number ke saath yah bharvaya jayega ki unke upar kitna karj he
 Receiving will also be given to the farmer after filling the demand letter
 rajput bataate hai, ''congress centre sarkaar se kisaanon kaa karj maaf karwaane ke liye dabaav banaaegi
 a target has been set to get at least 25,000 people from every block and at least two crore demand letters from all over the state

 Ajit Kumar says, "rahul Gandhi is redeeming the same issues among farmers in UP which he has run in the Lok Sabha elections

 brahmin-muslim Jugalbandi Prashant Kishore has a special focus on the Brahmin and Muslim in UP politics, in which a party has a dilemma about support
 upi siem ke ummidavaar ke rup main dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko pesh karne ke baad congress ne behad aakraamak dhang se brahmanon ke bich paith banane kii ranneeti banaai he
 PK spoke directly to young leaders like former Union Minister Jitin Prasad, MLA Lalitesh Pati Tripathi, Aradhana Mishra, Rajesh Mishra and informed them about the roadmap prepared for the Brahmins
 congress upi main brahmanon ke bich 'abhi nahin to kabhi nahin' jaise naare ke saath apana focus karegi
 Apart from this, the Congress will not directly coordinate and send its leaders to the program of non-political organizations of Brahmins
 kanpur ke aryanagar main 4 sitambar ko brahman chetana parishad ke kaarykram main congressi netaa jitin prasad maujuud the
 Jitin accuses the BJP of neglecting Brahmins as a strategy
 ve kehete hai, ''loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne upi se 73 siten jeetin par chunaav baad pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant bajpeyi ko bike se ravaanaa kar diya
 Rahul Gandhi, who started the Kisan Maha Yatra from Deoria, the parliamentary constituency of bjp's Brahmin face and Union Minister Kalraj Mishra, also gave a message of soft Hindutva by worshiping at the famous Dugdeshwar Nath temple here
 udhar, musalamaanon ko sandesh dene ke liye unhone apni kisaan mahayatra main upi ke prabharee or rashtriya mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad ko saath rakhaa he
 Making changes in the state Congress, Kishore has handed over the command of the organization to the Congress leader Fazle Masood coming from Purvanchal (see box)

 State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is misleading the people of Bihar about central projects
 nitish ne yah tippanee manmohan ke us kathan ke sandarbh main kii jisamen unhone kaha tha ki bihar sarkaar centre pryojit yojanaon ko lekar pradesh kii janata ko gumraah kar rahi he tathaa unhen lagu karne main apni jimmedaari thik dhang se nahin nibhaa rahi
 The Chief Minister challenged open debate for this and said, 'we are not doing the same to mislead
 ’ rajg ke ghatak dal jadyu or bhaajapa dwaara sanyukt rup se bulaae gaye samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue nitish ne kaha ki kaha ki pradhanmantri bade aadmi hai or vah unki izzat karte hai
 Even though he is the leader of another party and he also has the right to ask for votes for his party, he would like to tell them that he has not yet learned the art of misappropriation of funds nor has he got so much
 nitish ke saath varisht bhaajapa netaa arun jetali bhi maujuud the
 Describing the Prime Minister's statement as sad, the Chief Minister said that to what extent it is appropriate to make false accusations on others and to concoct things
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki chunaav ke dauraan log apni baaten rakhte hai
 He has waged his campaign within a dignity, but it is not right if breaking the other dignity and making unsympathetic statements
 bihar kii janata in sab chizon ko dekh rahi he
 Nitish said that Lalu ji's previous account is in front of everyone
 15 saal unhone bihar ke liye jo kuch ‘kamaal’ kiya he janata bhi is baar ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main ‘kamaal’ kaa prati uttar degi
 Nitish Kumar said that the Congress party is trying to build its base in Bihar and its previous account is also in front of everyone
 unhone kaha ki varsh 1997 main bihar main jab rajd kii sarkaar alpamat main aa gayi to uski raksha ke liye congress party aayi or use bachaaya
 In the year 2000, the two parties separated from each other and contested
 jaisaa is baar ho rahaa tab bhi vaise hi chunaav main unke tamaam bade netaaon ne chunaav prachaar kiya or usamen vahi baaten kahin jo aaj kah rahe hai
 Even then Congress leaders had said that they would never go with RJD but after the elections of 2000, when the situation of hung assembly came and they got a chance to form government first, the Congress party decided to support RJD again
 And a common government was formed
 unhone kaha ki us samay congress party ke 23 vidhayak the or usamen ek bihar vidhansabha sabha ke adhyaksh bane or baaki anya mantri bane
 Accusing the Congress and RJD of meeting even today, Nitish said that this time too, under a fixed strategy, they are attacking each other directly and do not present any evidence for that
 nitish ne kaha ki unhone kai baar yah sawaal uthaaya he ki loksabhaa main chaar sadasyon vaali party rajd ke netaa lalu prasad ko sadan main agali seat kiski krupa se mili hui he
 He said that this cemented the intimate relationship between the Congress and the RJD
 congress party ko lekar logon kaa purana tajurba he ki jab bhi vah centre main aati he manhagaai badhaane ke saath hi loktantric sansthaaon or paramparaon ko todane kaa kaam karti he tathaa sangheey dhaanche par hamalaa karti he
 Nitish said that this time too inflation has increased in the country like the previous Congress governments and the federal structure is under attack
 unhone pradhanmantri dwaara kal die gaye bayaan par aashcharya vyakt karte hue kaha ki unako party se alag hokar chizon ko dekhnaa chahie
 Nitish said that he had been inviting the Prime Minister to come to Bihar for the last five years but he did not get any time
 unhone kaha ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang rakhane ke liye sarvadaleey shishtmandal ke liye pradhanmantri se samay maanga par varsh 2006 se aaj tak unhen samay nahin diya gaya
 On the Prime Minister's statement that during the last six years, Rs
 6000 crores was given to Bihar as a special package by the Saprang Government of the Center, Nitish said that the Prime Minister would not ignore the facts in this way and it was not expected that he would improve Would like to do nitish ne kaha ki bihar ko ukt raashi varsh 2002 se mil rahi he or yah nirnay samprag sarkaar kaa nahin balki centre kii pichhali rajg sarkaar kaa nirnay he or isaki jad main bihar punargathan vidheyak he
 Urging the Prime Minister to preview the Bihar Reorganization Bill once, Nitish said that the decision to give one thousand crore rupees to Bihar was taken at the time of Bihar's separation from Bihar at the time of Partition
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki varsh 2004 main centre main samprag kii sarkaar banane par pradhanmantri ne bihar ko vishesh package dene kii baat kahi thi par vah aaj tak nahin mila or na hi is pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya
 He said that apart from this, permission was not given to make sugar cane from sugarcane, nor was it given coal linkage
 nitish ne kaha ki pradhanmantri yojana ayog ke adhyaksh hai or ukt raashi ke bare main kuch bhi bolne se pehle vah yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh se puch lete kyonki ukt raashi to kendriya agenciyon ko hi kharch kerani he
 He said that the charges that are levied on the states regarding the central amount should not be levied, but by doing so with the Union minister indiscriminately attacking the federal structure of the country
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki yojnamad ke tahat jo sahaayta rajyon ko centre se milti he uskaa formula purv se bana hua he
 He said that about the taxes collected in the country, the Planning Commission decides how much share will remain with the center and how much will be given to the states
 nitish ne kaha ki ukt tex par rajyon kaa bhi adhikaar he isliye centre jo kisi rajya ko raashi detaa he vah uski krupa nahin hoti
 Nitish said that as far as the centrally sponsored schemes are concerned, the states also have to put their share in it and the matter has been raised in the National Development Council to reduce it and leave the decision over the states
 mukhshmantri ne kaha ki lekin yahaan ho yah rahaa he ki purv main centre apane paas jitna rakhata tha vartmaan main usase zyada apane paas rakh rahaa he or kam hissaa rajyon ke bich vitarit kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that he has made it clear in the past that seventy percent of the amount in the plan size of Rs
 20 thousand crore is from the internal sources of the state
 is avasar bhaajapa ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne centre par bihar ke saath bhedbhaav baratane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ek arthshaastri hone ke naate pradhanmantri ne bihar kii vartmaan aarthik sthiti kaa vishleshan kiya hota to ve us par is tarah kaa bebuniyaad aarope nahin lagaate
 He said that he is satisfied with the work done by the NDA government of the state for the development of the state and will appeal to the people to give a second chance to the Nitish-led NDA government

 america vaigyanik ek aisi dawa ko duniya ke saamne laane ke kareeb pahunch chuke hai jiske baad mumkin he hamaari umr main ijapha ho jaae or badhati umr kaa asar dhundne se bhi na mili
 According to the New York Times, scientists have reached that stage and the use of this miraculous drug has also started in the laboratory

 Protein present in the body searches for the source of energy in sirtuin cells and resveratrol will act to induce sirtuin which will meet the high calorie requirement
 nateeja ye hoga ki sharir adhik calories kii zarurat hi mahasoos nahin kar sakegaa
 At present, the rats were housed in nutritious but 30 percent lower calorie intake than normal calories

 It is believed that when the experiment on mice has been successful, then it is possible that if this formula is applied to humans too, the result will surely go in favor
 haalanki javaani ko barkaraar rakhane ke is nae formule ko lekar kai vaigyanikon or shodhakartaaon main matbhed bhi he
 American scientists Gary Rouvkun, Jann Wigg and Judith Campisi consider it a blank fantasy

 Even if scientists do not agree with the ongoing experiment on the process of eradicating old age and curbing its symptoms, it is sure that due to this, the efforts of humans and bio-researchers will certainly be accelerated

 The legend of Chyavan Rishi is recorded in the Puranas, when Ashwini Kumar, the physician of the gods, brought with him the divine nectar that always made him young
 puranic katha ke mutabik, satyuga main aranyak van main chyavan rishi tapasya main itane leen the ki unke sharir par chintiyon ne bambi bana lee thi
 Then King Shariati arrived with his queens and only daughter Sukanya
 chintiyon kii bambi se chamakati rishi chyavan kii do ankhon ko sukanya ne kuch or samajha or ek lakdi se kured diya
 Sage Chyavan groaned with pain, then King Sharyati married Sukanya to Chyavan Rishi to atone for this sin
 sukanya apane pati chyavan rishi kii seva karti rahi
 Pleased by his devotion, Ashwini Kumar, the physician of the gods, brought a special avaleh made of 52 herbs
 us avaleh ke seven se chyavan rishi kii ankhon kii roshni hi nahin, balki javaani bhi laut ai
 52 Herbal Qualities In just one pill, the Ayurveda experts believe that the 52 herbs that the Chyavan sage received from him were Chyawanprash, which is still considered a rare recipe for health
 ab vaigyanik javaani kaa jo formula taiyaar karne kii kavayad main jute hai, use dekhakar to yahi lagata he ki chyavan rishi ko mili 52 jadi-bootiyon ke gun bas ek goli main samaa jaaenge
 Scientists at the Barshop Institute of Longitudinal and Aging Studies, Texas, USA, have been working day and night to convert a chemical called rapamycin into a youth pill
 institute ke diarector doctor arlan richardsan kaa daawa he ki unki team anti aging drug yani lambey samay tak jawan banaae rakhane vaali dawa kaa nuskhaa kaaphi had tak dhund chuki he
 Age will increase by 20 years According to Doctor Richardson, if the anti-aging drug works on humans, then the age of people will increase by at least 20 years
 philhal is goli kaa chuhon par kaamyaab prayog kiya ja chukaa he
 Doctor Richardson, who has been searching for anti-aging medicine for 35 years, says that he was frustrated that he would be able to see such a medicine while he was alive, but a chemical called Rapamycin found in the soil of Easter Island made it impossible to do so
 vigyaan patrika nechar main javaani kii goli kaa jo byora chapa he, uske mutabik prashanth mahaasaagar ke anokh tapu easter island kii mitti main ek khaas baio chemical mila
 The old name of this island was Rapa Nui, hence the chemical was named 'rapamycin'
 umr ke asar kii raftaar sust ho jaati heenti aging drug banane main jute vaigyanikon kaa daawa he ki rapamicine badhati umr ke saath sharir main banane vaale cells par bahut asardaar he
 It prevents the formation of aging cells, which slows down the effect of age on the body
 isse kisi insaan kii ausat umr main 28-38 fisadi tak ijaafaa ho saktaa he
 According to Nature magazine, along with the team of Doctor Richardson, scientists of Michigan University of America and Jackson Laboratory of Bar Harbor are also involved in making anti-aging drugs and they are sure that soon common people can be in the hands of young people
 Gun Shot
 lekin vaigyanikon or shodhakartaaon kii mehnat rang laaegi isko lekar shankaa or sanshay bhi barkaraar he
 There are many experts who do not agree with its success
 bhavishya kii dawa kaa istemaal insaanon main naammumkinoxford uniwarsity kii shodhakarta line cokes ke mutabik rapamycin se bani dawa sharir kii rogon se ladane kii takat ko kamjor kar sakati he
 Lion Cox says that the use of drugs on mice in the laboratory was extremely successful but cannot be used in any way to increase the lifespan of humans because the antifungous agent rapamycin destroys the immunity of humans
 is lihaaj se rapamycin se banane vaali bhavishya kii dawa kaa istemaal insaanon main naammumkin he
 Currently, it is used on patients who have undergone an organ transplant operation
 in marijon kii pratirohak kshamta jab sharir main shaamil kiye ja rahe nae angon ko kabool karne rukaawat banati he to phir dawaaon ke jariye ise anukool banaaya jaataa he
 People will forget the definition of old age, although rapamycin has not yet been used to increase the lifespan of humans, but in the coming days it is being seen as an expectation from which the story of defeating age can begin
 
 bhale hi javaani barkaar rakhane ke nae formule ko lekar hone vaali mushkilon ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai lekin itnaa to tay he ki agar prayog kaamyaab rahata he to phir budhapa kise kehete hai log shaayad isaki paribhaasha bhi bhul jaaen

 pakistan or afghanistan ke liye america ke vishesh doot hollbrook agle hafte pakistan aa rahe hai
 Despite the increasing strength of the Taliban in Pakistan's border areas, especially in the Swat Valley, and despite this, Pakistan's careless attitude has forced the US to tighten its grip on Pakistan
 isi makasad ko pukhta karne ke liye hollbrook ye daura karne vaale he
 During this tour, Hallbrook will also prepare a blueprint for further action by the US on the land of Pakistan and Afghanistan
 america ne alqaida or taliban kaa puri tarah safaya karne ko tay kar liya he
 However, Obama had also given his opinion as soon as he became President
 pakistan ke sarahadi ilaake main talibani thikaanon par danaadan daagi jane lagi thim misile
 Not only this, the US had also made it clear that it has not taken up the contract to run Pakistan's house by directly cutting the civilian assistance to Pakistan by $ 55 million
 jaahir he paak sarkaar is karrwai se baukhalaai hui he or jagah-jagah america ko gidad bhabhakiyaan detii phir rahi he
 But, America has also decided that it does not matter to all of them
 wo chahta he to taliban or alqaida ke thikaanon kaa khaatmaa
 Meaning the message for Pakistan was clear, either eliminate the Taliban or let us do this
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se muslim mahilaon ke hit main teen talaak kaa mudda uthaae jane ke baad se desh bhar main nai bahes shuru ho gai he, lekin phir bhi muslim mahilaon ko unke pati kii ore se talaak dene kaa silsilaa rukne kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Now a similar case has come to light in Surat, Gujarat, where a Muslim husband divorced his wife over the phone and escaped with the real sister-in-law
 surat ke jhapa bazaar ilaake ke taiyabi mohalle main rahane vaali jainab bibi kaa nikaah teen saal pehle mohammad kasim ke saath hua tha
 After marriage, their marital life was going well
 magar pichley kuch dinon se donon ke bich maamuli baat par jhagada shuru ho gaya
 Zainab is also the one year old son of Bibi and Mohammad Qasim
 is baar jab jainab apane pita ke ghar ai, tab achaanak pati kaa phone aayaa
 Zainab felt that the husband wanted to talk to them, but what the husband said on the phone, the ground slipped under Zainab Bibi's feet
 mohammad kasim ne phone par teen baar talaak kaha or in teen shabdon ne jainab se sab kuch chin liya
 Zainab Bibi was stunned to hear three divorces
 vah phone paratlakadene vaale apane pati se kuch kah paati ki isse pehle hi mohammad kasim ne phone kaat diya
 After divorcing Nikah Zainab Bibi by running away with Shali, Mohammad Qasim has eloped with his only younger sister i
e
 his sister Nasim Banu
 phone paratlakka shikaar hui jainab bibi ne kabhi sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki uskaa pati aisa karegaa
 Where will justice be found Bibi is worried about where she should go for justice? She also went to file a police report against her husband, but the police did not register her report
 ab prashasan bhi unako nyaay dilaane main laachaar najar aa rahaa he
 The police is also not helping Zainab in any way
 vahiin, is ghatana se jainab bibi ke pita par pahaad tut padaa he
 They do not understand what to do about the future of their daughters? On one hand the younger daughter's house was set up, on the other hand the elder daughter's house was destroyed
 ab vah apni badi beti ko nyaay dilaane ke liye dar-dar kii thokare kha rahe hai
 Law required for Muslim women, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has raised his voice for the rights of Muslim women
 agar sarkaar is babat kanoon bana detii he, to talakshuda jainab bibi jaisi hajaaron mahilaon ko sanjivani mil jaaegi
 Muslim women will also get the right to law
 saath in mahilaon par atyaachaar band ho jayega

 Under the central government's Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana, many of the veteran mps of Uttar Pradesh did not start the change at the basic level even after a year passed in the villages for adoption
 congress, samaajawaadee party (sapa), bahujan samaaj party (basapa) jaise pramukh dalon ke rashtriya adhyakshon ne bhi uttar pradesh ke gaavon ko god liya he,lekin in gaanvon ke nivasee apane ko thaga-sa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The reason for the negligence of public representatives is that about 65 percent of the mps of the state have not yet invested a single part of their MP funds in development works
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi god liye apane gaanv ko ek baar dekhne tak nahin gayi
 It is worth mentioning that on 11 October 2014, on the birthday of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash, the Prime Minister started the MP Adarsh gram Yojana
 is yojana main gaanvon ko viksit karne kaa kaary atirikt dhan ke bajaay saansad nidhi se hi karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 This scheme is now beginning to be a joke
 yojana shuru hone ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne adarsh gram yojana ke tahat apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke jayapur gaanv ko god liya
 After this, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav adopted Tamoli village in his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne bhi lakhanu ke maal gaanv ko god liya he
 Congress president and MP from Rae Bareli has chosen Udava, the ancestral village of Rana Beni Madhav Bakhsh Singh, the immortal fighter of the first freedom struggle of 1857, while her son and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has adopted Dih village of Jagdishpur block in Amethi

 uttar pradesh main adarsh gaanvon main pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara god liye gaye jayapur gaanv main badlaav kii shuruyaat hui he
 Six months ago, Jayapur village was unknown even though it was near the varanasi-allahabad highway
 yojana kii shuruyaat ke baad se hi yahaan daakghar, bank va kaimkaanon kaa nirmaan ho chukaa hesonia kaa godaganvcongress adhyaksh or raibareli kii saansad sonia gandhi ne jab udwa gaanv ko god liya to logon kii isse kaaphi ummiden jud gai thim, lekin graminon ko is baat kaa malaal he ki saansad ne udwa gaanv ko god to le liya, lekin na to use dekhne ai or na hi unka koi numaayinda logon kaa dukhadard jaanane aayaa
 Not a single penny has been received from mp's fund for development
 gaanv waalon ne bataaya ki unhen log bataate hai ki sadak or handpampon ke liye prastaav banaae gaye hai
 But no one knows anything about when these proposals will get money, when will there be development
 mulaayam singh yadav kaa godagaanvazamgarh ke palhani vikaas khand kaa tamoli gaanv ko mulaayam singh yadav ne god le rakhaa he
 Even after being adjacent to the district headquarters, the village was anonymous
 isamen bhu-bhaag or kheti-baadi to thi par vikaas kii raftaar nahin thi
 The villagers say that some plans are also ready and waiting for their concrete form, while the under construction medical college has changed the appearance of the village
 gaanv main deyari or stadium ke khulne kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 31 projects are underway for the overall development of the village
 jila vikaas adhikari jagatnarayan raay ne bataaya ki tamoli yojanaon ko amalijama pahanaae jane ko lekar 14 va 15 may ko gaanv main samanvay ke liye baithak ho chuki he
 Guidelines of the MP scheme have been made available to all
 gaanv kii sabase badi samasya he pani kii nikasi
 The construction of a drain in the village has come to a standstill due to disputes
 rajnath singh kaa godagaanvarajnath singh ne lakhanu ke paas benti gaanv god liya he, lekin paanch maheene bitne ke baad bhi yah gaanv apane vikaas kii baat joh rahaa he
 Many basic facilities like roads, water, colleges and hospitals still look far from the reach of this village
 beete 10 april ko lakhanu aae rajnath singh ne elaan kiya tha ki bentigaanv ke vikaas kaa khaakakhinch liya gaya he
 Development works will be started soon there, but when people were talked to here, it was found that their hopes were over
 chah disambar ko rajnath singh benti gaanv main oriental bank kii shakha kaa udghaatan karne aae the
 After this, 10 hand pumps were installed by the bank itself, while 30 hand pumps are still needed in this village
 benti gaanv ke pradhan girish tiwari kaa kahana he ki rajnath singh ko gaanv god lene ke baad aam sahmati se 20 maangon kaa prastaav bheja gaya tha
 After a long time, they have not received any reply so far

 chunaav haarane ke baad pehali baar akhilesh yadav apane pita mulaayam singh yadav se milane unke ghar panhuche
 Though there is only one wall gap between the two bungalows on Vikramaditya Marg, this gap could be bridged six months after losing the election when Mulayam refused to read the script to form Shivpal's separate party
 baap bete kii ye mulaakaat kareeb 25 minute chali, jisamen donon taraf se gile-shikave dur karne kii koshish hui
 According to sources, Mulayam became emotional after Akhilesh's arrival, his throat was strangled
 kaaphi der tak donon chup rahe
 The conversation started by Akhilesh Yadav
 mana ja rahaa he akhilesh yadav ne unhen 5 oktober ko agra main hone vaale rashtriya adhiveshan main bataur sangrakshak aane kaa nimantran diya
 If sources are to be believed, Mulayam has agreed to go to the national convention
 agar mulaayam singh rashtriya adhiveshan kaa rukh karte he toshivpal yadavake liye ab sabhi raste band ho jaaenge
 The melting of the snow on the relationship between father and son started with the press conference held at Lohia Trust
 isamemulaayam singh yadavane shivpal ke nai party banane kii koshishon ko ek jatke main palitha laga diya tha
 Although Mulayam had whipped Akhilesh with his father for taking away the post of president, even said that what would happen to someone who did not belong to his father
 kose jane ke baad bhi akhilesh ne mulaayam singh yadav ke jindabad kaa naaraa buland kiya tha or twitor par netaji or samaajawaadee party jindabad likhaa
 At the same time, dozens of Akhilesh supporters went to meet Mulayam and took photographs with him
 mulaayam singh ke is nae you turn ko raajnneetik halkon main behad hi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 If Mulayam stands on the podium with Akhilesh, the Samajwadi Party will again be full of enthusiasm and he will get the Sanjeevani which he needs most in the 2019 elections

 film kaa naam: nurdiarector: sunhill sippistar cast: sonakshi sinha, canan gil, manish choudhary, purab kohli, shibani dandekar, smita tambivadhi: 1 ghanta 54 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2 starsaal 2014 main pakistani jarnlist-riter sabaa saiyad ne 'karachi you aar keeling meen' naamak nowell likhaa jo kii bestceller ke rup main bhi sabake saamne aayaa
 The story in Novel was that of 20-year-old journalist Ayesha, who has been brought forward through the film 'noor'
 upanyaas par aadhaarit or sonakshi sinha ke lead role ke saath kisi bani he yah film, aaie jaanate hai:kahani:yah kahani mumbai kii rahane vaali 28 saal kii jarnlist nur roy choudhary (sonakshi sinha) kii he, jo apane pita ke saath rahati he
 Noor's mother died in childhood
 nur kii jindagi main uske do dost jaaraa patel (shibani dandekar) or saad sahagal (canan gil) kaaphi ahmiyat rakhte hai
 Noor always wants to do stories based on real issues, but his boss Shekhar Das (manish Chaudhary) always asks him to do entertainment stories
 isi bich nur ko ek aise gang kii kahani kaa pataa chalata he jo bahut bada racket chalaata he or jisamen shahar ke bade-bade log bhi involve hai
 Noor does this story too but her story is stolen
 isi bich kahani main ayaan banerjee (purab kohli) kii entry hoti he
 Eventually, the story takes several turns and the story takes place
 bollywood kii bikini bebs main ab sonakshi sinha kii bhi entrikamjor kadiyaan:film kii kamjor kadi isaki kahani he jo kaaphi boring he or bahut hi dhire dhire chalati he , isaki raftaar tej kii ja sakati thi or saath hi jis nowell par aadhaarit yah film he usamen kai saare utaar chadhaav or thrilling eliments hote hai par film ko koi or hi rup de diya gaya he jisaki vajah se kaaphi feeki feeki si kahani ban gayi
 No character seems to be justified and in many places there seems to be quite a drawn story
 film main mumbai se related ek bada monolog he, jisaki likhaawat to kamaal kii he lekin use or bhi damdaar tareeke se pech kiya ja saktaa tha
 The story of a journalist is depicted in the film but Sunhil has failed to show the story going on around the journalist or in real life
 film kyon dekh sakate hai:film main sonakshi sinha ne bahut hi badhiya abhinay kiya he jo kaaphi dilachasp he
 Other characters like Sonakshi Sinha, Kanan Gill, Manish Chaudhary, Purab Kohli, Shibani Dandekar, Smita Tambe have also acted spontaneously
 smita tambe ne kuch seens kamaal ke kiye hai
 The story of the film is quite interesting and the dialogues are quite hard heating
 film kaa pehla or aakhri seen aapako sochane par vivash kar hi detaa he
 The direction, location of the film is good and the way of shooting is good
 sangeet thik thaak he lekin 'gulabi ankhen' behtareen sog he
 Box Office: The budget of the film is said to be around 15 crores and there is a hope of cost recovery of the film along with digital and satellite rights

 vah daur ab ja chukaa he jab bade hue pet ko khate-pite ghar kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 Nowadays, children want to become slim-trim from bourgeois
 zyaadaatar log apane bade hue pet se pareshaan rahete hai
 Actually in today's lifestyle, where we have to work sitting in front of the computer for hours, we have become like eating and sleeping etc
 in one place
 jiskaa nateeja hamaara badha hua pet hota he
 But if you want to get flat tummy, then you can fulfill your desire by removing some special things taken daily from your diet
 aaie jaanate hai in chizon ke bare main
 Along with the packed juice and soda, remove sugar from your tea and coffee
 din main kam se kam 8 se 10 gilaas pani jarur pien, yah na keval aapako hydrateed rakhega balki isse aapako baar-baar bhukh bhi nahin lagegi
 You like to drink milk and you cannot live without it, if this happens, then let your desire for flat tummy go
 darasal doodh pine ke baad gas hone kii samasya baraabar bani rahati he, jis kaaran hamaara pet phoolne lagata he
 You can use curd instead of milk
 ham apane test ke hisaab se apane khaane main namak istemaal karte hai
 Some people also like to eat extra salt mixed with it
 par aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki namak kaa adhik seven karne se sharir main water rettesan bad jaataa he
 In this case, use as little salt as possible
 adhik tala-bhunaa or chatapata khaanaa flats team paane kii ichha kaa kabhi puraa nahin hone degaa
 You may complain of stomach irritation and pain
 is tarah ke khaane ko diguest karne main bhi dikkat hoti he, jis kaaran vasa hamaare sharir main jamaa hone lagati he
 Eating fried and junk food with friends may be your favorite, but keep in mind that they are enemies of your perfect figure
 agar aap flats tami paanaa chaahate hai to in burgers or pizza ko khaanaa band kar den
 In addition, such foods, which are high in carbohydrates, cut them out of your diet
 packed zeus or soda ke saath-saath, apni chaay or coffee main se sugar ko hataa den
 Drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day, it will not only keep you hydrated but it will not make you hungry again and again
 doodh pinaa aapako behad pasand he or iske bina aap rah nahin sakate, agar aisa ho to janaab flats tami kii apni chahat ko said kar dijie
 Actually, after drinking milk, the problem of gas remains the same, due to which our stomach starts bloating
 doodh kii jagah aap dahi kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 We use salt in our food according to our test
 kuch log upar se extra namak milakar bhi khaanaa pasand karte hai
 But you will be surprised to know that excessive intake of salt increases water retention in the body
 aise main khaane main jitna kam ho sakate utana namak istemaal karen
 More fries and fattening food will never allow the desire to get a flat team
 isse aapako pet main jalan or dard kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 It is also difficult to digest such food, due to which fat starts to accumulate in our body
 frends ke saath fried or junk food khaanaa ho saktaa he aapako behad pasand ho par ye dhyaan rakhen ki ye aapke parfect figure ke dushman hai
 If you want to get flat tummy then stop eating these burgers and pizza
 iske alaava aise khaadya padaarth, jinamein carbohydrate adhik paaya jaataa he, inhen apni diet main se cat kar den

 5
 Overcoming the pressure - Team India did not let the pressure of falling three wickets early and the slow run rate in the middle overs

 Why is the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos so important this year? Global economies are poised to bring the free market to center, amid the slowdown of the global recession and a period of diplomatic stability on both sides of the Atlantic Sea

 Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has alleged that Vasundhara Raje will probably be the first leader in the entire country after independence to submit an affidavit to the foreign government in favor of a fugitive from the country
 itnaa bada aparaadh karne ke baad to raaje kaa naitikta ke aadhaar par istipha de dena chahie tha
 Gehlot told reporters in the assembly premises that the money that was put in the palace of Dholpur of Vasundhara Raje came from Mauritius
 vahi paisa lakhanu or dilli main bhi laga he
 He said that it is a matter of crores of rupees
 dhaulpur main 7 star hotel ban gaya he, uski jaanch kare to vastav main morishas ke raste aae paise kaa kaise upyog hua he, jaanch main saamne aa jayega
 It is not hidden from anyone that the money that was looted as a 'power broker' in the era of Lalit Modi has come to their companies through Mauritius
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vasundhara raaje ne ek baar bhi media ko apane upar lage aaropon kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also holding silence
 unhone videshmantri sushamaa swaraj, vasundhara raaje or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh ke bare main ek shabd bhi nahin kaha he
 The comments unhone kaha ki unki drushti se yaa to unka bhi maananaa yahi hoga ki ye teenon doshi hai athwa vah rajnatik kaarnon se bachaane main lage hue hai
 The former Chief Minister said that there is no such thing as government in Rajasthan today
 yah ek nikammi or bhrasht sarkaar he
 Lalit Modi was present during Raje's previous government
 aaj vah adrishy rup se maujuud he
 He said, it is surprising that Vasundhara Raje is still sitting on the chair
 main soch rahaa tha ki naitikta ke naate vidhansabha satr shuru hone se pehle vah shaayad istipha de dengi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi maun dhaaran kiye hue hai
 He has not said a word about Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh
 tippaniyan He said that from his point of view either he must believe that these three are guilty or he is engaged in protecting for political reasons
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki rajasthan main aaj sarkaar naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 It is a poor and corrupt government
 raaje kii pichhali sarkaar ke samay lalit modi maujuud tha
 Today it exists invisibly
 unhone kaha, aashcharya is baat kaa he ki vasundhara raaje aaj bhi kursi par baithi hai
 i was thinking that she would probably resign before the assembly session started due to morality

 Just give me two minutes ” ham amuman roj yah baar-baar doharaate hai
 Two minutes
 120 second
 This very small piece of time passes before we know it
 kaam kaa din puraa hone se pehle yah 150 se 300 baar apane aapako doharaata he
 Coffee breaks, instant phone calls, fixing a messed up printer - two minutes is usually not enough to complete one of these simple tasks
 magar yahi ve do minute hai, jo patna hycourt main ek saamaanya din ek jaj ko ausatan ek sunwaayee ke liye milte hai
 Two minutes! This is one of the many frightening figures that Daksha has found in his study of the Indian judiciary
 yah to khayr jaani-maani hakeekat he ki hindustani adaalaton main mukademon main bahut lanbaa vakt lagata he
 Why is this? What can be done to solve this problem? What does this delay mean from the perspective of the rule of law in the country? What is the political, social and economic value of this delay? These are some of the most important questions that the judges, scholars and various commissions have asked, but have failed to answer them with certainty
 vidhi ayog kii puri kii puri reportein hai, jo isi sawaal ko samarpit hai
 Even then, despite all the discussions, debate and policy suggestions to tackle this issue, nothing has changed
 agar ham is badlaav na hone ko lekar chintan-manan karen or isaki vajahon par thik-thik ungali rakhen to do hi shabd dimag main aate hai-aankade or jimmedaari
 Why this delay is a complete lack of attention to relevant figures in this case
 hamen yah to pataa he ki nyaay vyavastha main kul milakar kitne maamle lambit hai (teen karod kaa aankada media vakt-vakt par doharaata rahata he) or kuch avaigyanik tathaa kaalpanik miyaad bhi bataai jaati he ki nyaaypalika ko in puraane lambit maamalon ko nibatane main kitna vakt lagegaa
 But we know very little about this delay problem
 masalan, aakhir ve kis kism ke mukademe hai jinhone puri vyavastha ko jakad rakhaa he? nyaayadhish beintahaa lambey-lambey vakt tay karte hai, iske baavjood aisa kyon he ki deree ke is vishaal pahaad main koi sanjeeda send nahin lagaai ja paa rahi he? kya ek soobe ke jaj kaam main duusare soobe ke jajon se zyada chust hai? alag-alag kism ke maamle aakhir kitne lambey vakt tak vyavastha main lambit rahete hai or kyon rahete hai? ham insaaf ke vakt ko zyada se zyada kaise badha sakate hai? badlaav laane ke liye in sawaalon ke jawaab bahut jaruri hai
 Yet until recently, no systematic attempt has been made to collect such data and information, which can help in finding answers to these questions
 daksh kaa “rule of lau project” nyaayik aankadon kii is kami ko kaaphi had tak puraa karata he
 Daksha's database currently contains details of more than 40 lakh such cases, which are pending in various courts of the country
 hamaare paas jin 21 hycorton kaa data maujuud he, unamem kisi bhi mukademe ke lambit hone kaa ausat vakt 3 saal or 1 maheenaa (1,128 din) he
 If you have a case going on in any subordinate court, then the probable average time taken to decide on it is about 6 years (2,184 days)
 agar maan len ki ek mukadmaa supreme court main nahin jaataa (or nyaay vyavastha main aane vaale bahutayat maamle nahin jate), to kam se kam ek oonchi adaalat main apil karne vaale ausat vaadi ko 10 saal se zyada vakt adaalaton main gujaarna pad saktaa he
 If your case goes to the Supreme Court, then the average time increases by at least 3 years
 yah bhi jarur yaad rakhen ki ham sirf ausat ke bare main baat kar rahe hai
 If you are very unlucky, your lawsuit may take longer than the average
 baat ko or sahi nazariye se saamne rakhane ke liye hamaare databes se khulaasa hua ki 1940 or 1950 ke dashak ke maamle bhi abhi adaalaton main lambit hai
 The frustration and frustration of those filing the case can be understood
 deree se paidaa hui anischitata or kuch nahin to kam se kam takalifdeh to he hi, kyonki yah adaalaton main lade ja rahe muddon par sawalia nishaan laga detii he
 a delayed solution may not ultimately be the solution
 ham dekh sakate hai ki agar aap karnataka ke hycourt main aaj koi mukadmaa daakhil karen, to aap bahut jaldi se jaldi 2019 tak adaalat main bane rahane kii ummid kar sakate hai
 In these 2 years and 8 months (969 days) you can expect to visit the court approximately 12-13 times, as the time between two hearings in the Karnataka High Court is 78 days
 ham kuch or bhi zyada tafaseeldaar aankadon par najar daal sakate hai
 For example, 7% of the total cases in the Karnataka High Court are regular first appeals (RFA)
 ye refe ausatan 4 saal or 3 maheene (1,553 dinon) se lambit hai
 On the other hand, company petitions have been pending for an average of 6 years
 haalanki ye karnataka hycourt ke kul maamalon kii mahaj 1 fisadi hi hai
 Our database has also presented a comparative picture of individual courts
 hyderabad ke hycourt main mukademe ausatan 2 saal 2 maheenon (779 dinon) se lambit hai
 The jurisdiction of this High Court includes both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, with a population of 8
 5 karod he
 Compare this with Gujarat, which has a population of 6 crore and whose average duration of pending cases in the High Court is a little over three years and 2 months (1,163 days)
 2
 In spite of having more than 5 crore people, how is it possible that the High Court of Hyderabad seems more efficient and agile than the High Court of Gujarat? The number of judges in the country is a figure which has a lot of hype
 magar jahaan yah to jaruri he ki nyaaypalika main sweekrut jajon kii niyukti kii jaae, vahiin jajon kii ginati badhaane bhar se mukademon ke salosal lambit hone kii samasya gaayab nahin ho jaaegi
 What should be considered instead of the ratio of judges to the population is the ratio of cases against the population
 daksh ke databes main maujuud aankadon ke mutabik aabaadi ke bainks mukademon ke anupaat kaa rashtriya ausat (683 main se 513 jilon ke maujuud aankadon ke aadhaar par) 1
 77 percent
 ab agar un jilon ko dekhen, jahaan aabaadi ke bainks mukademon kaa anupaat kam he, to isse hamen aise maahaul kii pahchaan karne main madad milegi jinamein mukademebaaji kii daren kam hoti hai
 And districts with higher rates can be better filled with more judges and infrastructure
 beshak mukademon kaa jaldi nibatara acchhee nyaay vyavastha kaa akelaa paimaana nahin he
 Lawsuits have to be dealt with fairly and equitably
 isse ham waapas thik vahiin pahunch jate hai, jahaan se hamane shuru kiya tha-nyaaypalika main lagane vaale vakt kaa sawaal
 Our database tells us that in the High Courts of India, judges hear between 20 and 150 cases a day in any number of cases
 is tarah roj 70 sunwaayiyon kaa ausat aata he
 Add one more aspect to this figure and that is the working hours
 jaj mukademon kii sunwaayee main roj ausatan 5 se 5
 Spend 5 hours
 yani 300 se 350 minute
 When we put the two figures together and give them a simple part, we find that the judges, who are the least burdened with workload in the country, have 15-16 minutes to listen to each case that comes before them
 Happens, while the busiest judges like the Patna High Court have just 2 to hear a case
 5 minute kaa vakt hota he or ek mukademe kaa faisla karne ke liye jajon ke paas ausatan 5-6 minute kaa vakt hota he
 We are just talking about the average here and yes, the judge spends a lot of time on the last hearing cases or the cases that need more attention
 lekin jab ek insaan se 70 maamalon se jude muddon par faisla dene ke liye kaha jaataa he to isamen se ninsaphi yaa anauchity kii baat ko alag hataa paanaa naammumkin he
 It is not only unfair to litigants and lawyers (and practicing lawyers will test the uncertainty arising from the sheer number of cases in our courts), but it is also extremely prejudicial to judges
 
 koi bhi samaaj apane jajon se is kadar tanaav kii haalat main na to kaam karne ke liye kah saktaa he or na hi unase rojaanaa insaaf dene kii ummid kar saktaa he
 It is like chasing a 300-run mountain in a T20 match
 har koi jaanata he ki aisa kar paanaa lagbhag naammumkin he or yah jaanate hue kaam karnaa faisle lene main kismat or sanyog, donon ko dakhal dene kaa mauka dena he
 In this way, the pressure to maintain the pace of runs in the chase forces the batsman to lose his wicket without thinking
 agar unhen munasib ranon kaa peechha karnaa hota to ve lakshya hasil kar sakate the
 Similarly, a judge is also forced to deal with certain cases casually and easily accepts the plea for the next date because he has a long list
 magar nyaayadhish beshak is boj se dabi vyavastha ke sabase kamjor shikaar nahin hai
 Daksha surveyed the accessibility of justice to get the perspective of the real victims of this system
 is survey main duusari baton ke saath-saath hamaari aapraadhik nyaay pranali ke gahare raaj ke bare main sawaal puche gaye-un vichaaradhin kaidiyon ke bare main jo abhiyog main mukarrar sajaa se kahin zyada vakt kaid main kaat chuke hai
 About 28 percent of the accused said that they had spent more time in jail than the prescribed punishment
 jamaanti aparaadhon ke aaropee 34 fisadi logon ne daawa kiya ki ve jail main hi rahane ko majaboor hai kyonki unke paas jamaanat yaa guarantee dene vaala koi nahin he
 Even if we remove the scope of mistake and the possibility of misconception, both of these figures are going to test
 beshak samoochee aapraadhik nyaay pranali ke liye nyaaypalika hi jimmedaar nahin he, lekin to bhi ye aankade niraashajanak tasviir to bayaan karte hi hai
 And that is the biggest aspect
 logon ko insaaf maangane or adaalaton main aane kii baari keemat chukaani padati he
 While lawyers' fees and court fees can be huge, the personal costs can also be very high, which the litigant has to pay
 survey ne do keemton kii thaah lene kii koshish kii
 One of these was the price to be paid by the litigants in coming to the court for a hearing, and the other was the cost of work and business loss because of their presence in court
 prayek vaadi ne adaalat main maujuud rahane par ausatan prati din 519 rupee kharch kiye
 Assume a minimum of two litigants in each case and the number of lower courts in the country (we have taken this number to 16,400, as per the Supreme Court data, the number of lower courts in the country is at least 20,000) and average court hearings per court Multiply that by the number, we can estimate the total amount that the plaintiff is spending just to be present in the hearings of the courts
 itane bandhe-badhaae hisaab se bhi yah rakam har saal 30,000 karod ru
 Stay! This amount is so huge that it is shocking on every scale
 isse bhi zyada badtar yah he ki salanaa 1 lakh ru
 The less-than-income litigants spent 10% of their earnings on being present at hearings in a year
 duusari kanoonee fees chukaain, so alag
 Especially for poor people, it can be better to live without justice than to get such expensive justice
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki hamaare survey main mukadmaa karne vaale jin logon se baat kii gai, unamem 33 fisadi ne adaalaton kii sharan main jane kii bajaae vivaadon ke nibatare ke vaikalpik sadhano ke istemaal kii tasdik kii
 They went to the family elders, village or caste panchayats or police before going to the courts to deal with the cases
 adaalaton ke baahar masalon ko sulajhane kii koshish main koi buraai nahin he, lekin unamem se kuch ne zyaadaatar maukon par jin tareekon kaa istemaal kiya, unhen gaiyr-kanoonee nahin bhi to kanoon se hatakar hi kaha ja saktaa he
 These were the ways through which the foundation of getting justice is hurt only by the constitution and rule of law
 to bhi asal dhakka pahunchane vaali baat kaam yaa kaarobaar kaa baari nuksaan he
 This is due to wastage of work time, salary and business losses
 hamaare survey ke mutabik, utpaadakta kaa yah nuksaan prati vaadi 873 ru
 is
 har sunwaayee ke liye harek vaadi ke adaalat jane par kharch kii gai rakam kaa hisaab lagane ke liye hamane jis tareeke kaa istemaal kiya tha, usee bandhe-bandhaae tareeke kaa istemaal karen to ham har saal utpaadakta ke nuksaan kaa hisaab laga sakate hai
 This figure is also very shocking, with Rs 50,387 every year
 he! rashtriya keemat ke taur par yah desh ke jidipi main 0
 Increases by 48%
 agaryah mukademebaaji kii baari-bharkam keemat nahin he to or kya he?ise kaise karen durustato is masale ko sulajhane vaala aakhir koun he? badakismati se yahi saaf nahin he
 Both the judiciary and the executive are deeply concerned about the issue of delays in lawsuits
 haal ke varshon main raashtrapati, pradhan nyaayadhish or kai cabinet mantriyon ne saarvajanik bayaan die hai ki kis tarah nyaaypalika is sankat se darpesh he or kis tarah yah kanoon kii hukumat ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 So the real issue is not worry or concern, kuwat, strength and time
 aaj koi aise pahachaane hue log nahin hai, jo nyaay pranali ke prashasan ko vakt de rahe hon, jisamen na sirf nyaayadhish balki usase jude naukarshah bhi aate hai or jo dher saare kaamon ko anjaam dete hai
 If these works are done efficiently then the efficiency of the system can be increased significantly
 sanvaidhanik yojana main hycourt (anivarytah uske mukhya nyaayadhish, jo prashasnic pramukh hote hai), ko rajya kii puri nyaaypalika kii dekharekh kii shakti di gai he
 Unfortunately, the Chief Justice also handles judicial work and, as mentioned above, is also strapped in time
 natijatan kuch prabud jajon ko chhod den to prashasan par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya jaataa or ise mote taur par registry ke adhikaar kshetra main chhod diya jaataa he
 The focus of the registry is mostly on everyday processes and does not have the means to focus on data collection, analysis or reforms at the policy level
 is sabake nattejey main nyaayik prashasan ek tarah se anaath ho gaya he
 Unless concerted efforts are made to create a well-established administrative structure, no effort to improve the system will have far-reaching consequences
 court manageron kii yojana ko acchhee tarah taiyaar or lagu karne main yaa rashtriya nyaayalay prabandhan pranali samiti kii duuradrushti ko aage le jane main naakaami isaki numaayan misaalen hai
 The need right now is judicial and political will
 harish narsappa vakil hai or saath hi data-sanchalit shodh ke aadhaar par rajkaaj kii sansthaaon main kshamta or javabdehi mensudhar ke liye kaary kar rahe sanghathan daksh ke sah-sansthaapak hai

 When he sent the file to the government with the specific condition that only BPL families be given Pongal gifts and those falling in the APL and AAY categories would not be eligible for it, i returned the file to them, registering our protest against their arbitrary decision
