 After IPL, Sehwag will have to undergo a second operation of shoulder rotator cuff muscle (the first one was in 2009)
 iske alaava unhen is saal ke shuru main ek short ball se pasli main chot lagi
 Gambhir suffered a dangerous shoulder injury during the World Cup 2011 Final League match

 "so, not surprisingly," second injury syndrome "is common among cricketers

 The vein behind Tendulkar's knee is disturbing again
 yuvaraj kaa ghutana or jahir kaa peeth dard or anya pareshaaniyaan baar-baar sataati hai kyonki usee mansapeshi kaa istemaal zyada hota he
 According to Dilip Nadkarni, orthopedist at the Sport Medicine Unit at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, four types of cricketing movement cause injury: push (when the ball hits), the centerpiece (when the batsman starts running and then, comes back for some reason 
 isse ghutane yaa kandhe main chot lag sakati he), twisting (khilaadi gend ke saath daudta he, takhne ko jhtka detaa he or gir jaataa he), or streacing (kaich lene ke liye dive
 This may cause an injury to the back of the knee)
 tej gendbaaj aisi chot ke shikaar banate hai
 "it is like an absconding car that needs high class servicing, correct technics, rehab, prehab (special exercise)," says Nadkarni
 iske alaava, lambey pratispardhaatmak khelon main zyada pasinaa nikalne ke kaaran sharir main pani kii kami ko ham kam mahatv dete hai

 unhone kaha ki sharir main pani kii kami se mansapeshiyon main khinchaav, dhadkan, ekaagratha main kami aa sakati he jiske parinamswaroop chot lag sakati he
 Older cricketers do not accept such things

 But if he rests during a tour, then the selectors should be tough not to select that player for future tours

 It depends on whether the player is trained at NCA Bangalore or the team trains them at the match venue, India or abroad

 The Gujarat Congress has jumped into the controversy started by the state government over the action of seizing the land of Sikh farmers
 party ne kaha he ki modi kisaanon ke visthaapan ke mudde par purv kii congress sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraakar ‘jhooth’ bol rahe hai

 kendriya mantri wike singh ne lekhakon dwaara ashishnutaa kaa ullekh karte hue puraskaar vaapasi ko ek sajeesh qaraar diya or kaha ki vah yojanabaddh tha
 Singh also said that Karan Johar's remarks on democracy and freedom of expression at the Jaipur Literature Festival were meant to gain publicity and remain in the news and should not be 'given importance'
 ' pakistan ke saath sambandh ke bare main unhone kaha, 'dwipaksheeya muddon ko sulajhane ke liye jari vaarta kii prakriya pathankot jaisi ghatnaon se prabhavit nahin honi chahie
 During the release of his book 'an Unsweetable Boy' at the Hindi Literature Conference, Karan had said that 'if you want to tell your mind or unravel the secrets of your personal life, India is the most difficult country
 ' unhone saath hi kaha 'mujhe to lagata he jaise hameshaa koi legal notice meraa peechha karata rahata he
 No one knows when an FIR is lodged against him
 ' On this occasion, Karan said, '14 years ago i have faced a case of insulting the national anthem
 apni nijee raay rakhana or prajatantr kii baat karnaa, ye donon hi mazaaq hai
 We talk about the expression of ideas, but if i give my opinion as a celebrity, then a big controversy arises
 'darasal jaipur sahitya sammelan main apni kitaab 'en ansuteble bvoy' ke vimochan ke dauraan karan ne kaha tha ki 'aap man kii baat kahana chaahate hai yaa apni nijee jindagi ke raaj kholana chaahate hai to bharat sabase mushkil desh he

 conklev main piem modi ne kai badi baaten kahi
 Read below: First of all, many congratulations and best wishes for this event
 india today conklev se judane kaa mujhe pehle bhi avasar mila he
 i have been told that yesterday, the editor-in-chief of India Today Group has given me a new post - 'disaster-in-chief'
 do din se aap log 'da great disrpshan' par manthan kar rahe hai
 Friends, for many decades we went in the wrong direction with wrong policies
 sab kuch sarkaar karegi yah bhav prabal ho gaya
 The mistake came to mind after several decades
 galati sudhaarney kaa prayaas hua auki sochane kii seemaa bas itani thi ki do dashak pehle galati sudhaarney kaa ek prayaas hua or use hi riform maan liya gaya
 Most of the time, the country has either seen the same type of government or mixed
 uske kaaran desh ko ek hi Set of Thinking yaa activity najar ai
 The first born of political system was election driven or based on the Rigid Framework of Bureaucracy
 sarkaar chalaane ke yahi do system the or sarkaar kaa akalan bhi isi aadhaar par hota tha
 We have to accept that technology has changed in the last 20 years, more than technology has changed in 200 years
 sweekaar karnaa hoga ki 30 varsh pehle ke yuva or aaj ke yuva kii aspirations main bahut antar he
 One has to accept that all the equations of Bipolar World and Inter-dependent world have changed
 aazaadee ke andolan ke kalkhand ko dekhen to usamen Personal aspiration se zyada National Aspiration thi
 His intensity was such that he drove the country out of slavery for hundreds of years
 ab samay kii maang he-aazaadee ke andolan kii tarah vikaas kaa andolan- jo personal aspireshan ko colective aspireshan main vistaar kare or colective aspireshan desh ke sarvangin vikaas kaa ho
 This government is running with the dream of an India-best India
 samasyaon ko dekhne kaa tarika kaisaa ho, is par approach alag he
 For many years, there was a struggle on english-hindi in the country
 hindustan kii sabhi bhashaaen hamaari amaanat hai
 Attention was given to how to tie all languages into the formula of unity
 ek bharat-shreshth bharat kaarykram main do-do rajyon kii pairing karai or ab rajya ek-duusare kii saanskrithik vividhta ke bare main jaan rahe hai
 That is, things are changing and the way is different
 isliye aapkaa ye shabd in sab baton ke liye chota pad rahaa he
 This is not a thinking to destroy the systems
 ye kayakalp he jisase is desh kii aatma akshunn rahe, vyavasthaaen samay ke anukool hoti chalem
 This is the mind of the 21st century public
 isliye 'diserptor- in- chif' agar koi he to desh ke sava sau karod hindustani hai
 The person who is associated with the public mind of India will understand very well who is the Disaster
 bandhe-bandhaae vichaar, baton ko ab bhi puraane tareeke se dekhne kaa najariya aisa he ki kuch logon ko lagata he ki satta ke galiyare se hi duniya badalati he
 It is wrong to think so
 hamane Time bound impalimentation or Integrated thinking ko sarkaar ke work-culture ke saath joda he
 Such a way of working where there is transparency in the system, processes should be made citizen friendly and development friendly, re-engineer the process to bring efficiency
 dosto, aaj bharat duniya kii teji se viksit hoti arth-vyavasthaaon main se ek he
 India has been ranked in the world's top three prospect host economy in the World Investment Report
 varsh 2015-16 main 55 billian dollar se zyada kaa record nivesh hua
 In two years, India has risen 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum
 mek in india aaj bharat kaa sabase bada initiative ban chukaa he
 Today, India is the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world
 dosto, ye sarkaar kooparative federalism par jor detii he
 The GST that we have reached today is the result of a democratic democracy in which every state interacted
 GST par sahmati hona ek mahatvapurn outcome he lekin isaki prakriya bhi utani hi mahatvapurn he
 This is a decision that has been taken by consensus
 sabhi rajyon ne milakar isaki ownership lee he
 From your perspective it may be disruptive, but the GST is actually proof of the federal structure reaching a new height
 sabakaa saath-sabakaa vikaas sirf naaraa nahin he, ise jikar dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Friends, in our country it has been considered that labor laws are a hindrance in development
 duusari taraf ye bhi mana gaya ki labour laws main sudhaar karne vaale anti-labour hai
 That is, both were extreme conditions
 kabhi ye nahin sochaa gaya ki implyer, implai or aspirents teenon ke liye ek holistic approach lekar kaise aage badha jaae
 In order to comply with different labor laws in the country, the first employer had to fill information in 56 different registers
 ek hi jaankaree baar-baar alag-alag registeron main bhari jaati thi
 Now last month, the government has notified that the employer will have to maintain not just 56 registers under the labor laws
 ye business ko easy karne main udhyamiyon kii badi madad karegaa
 The government is also focused on expanding the job market
 Public Sector, Private Sector ke saath hi sarkaar kaa jor Personal Sector par bhi he
 Under the Mudra scheme, young people are being given loans without bank guarantee
 pichley dhai varshon main chah karod se zyada logon ko mudra yojana ke tahat teen lakh karod se zyada karj diya gaya he

 pehali baar kaushal vikaas mantralay banaakar isapar puri planning ke saath kaam ho rahaa he
 Formal Employment is being promoted through Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana and Income Tax exemption
 isi tarah aprintisship act main sudharkarke aprintison kii sankhya badhaai gai he or aprintis ke dauraan milane vaale steepend main bhi badhotaree kii gai he
 Friends, manpower is more important than the power of government
 india today conklev ke manch par main pehle bhi kah chukaa hum ki bina desh ke logon ko jode, itnaa bada desh chalaanaa sambhav nahin he
 It is not possible to move forward without taking the manpower of the country
 diwaali ke baad kaledhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hui karrwai ke baad aap sabhi ne janashakti kaa aisa udhaaharan dekha he, jo yuddh ke samay athwa sankat ke samay hi dikhataa he
 This manpower is coming together because people want to end the evils within their country, want to beat the weaknesses and move forward, create a New India
 agar aaj svachh bharat abhiyaan ke tahat desh main 4 karod se zyada shauchalay bane hai, 100 se zyada jile khule main shouch se mukt ghoshit hue hai to ye isi janashakti kii ekajutata kaa pramaan he
 If more than one crore people are refusing to take advantage of the gas subsidy, then this is an example of this manpower
 isliye aavashyak he ki janabhaawanaaon kaa sammaan ho or janaakankshaon ko samajhate hue deshhit main faisle liye jaaen or unhen samay par puraa kiya jaae
 When the government started the Jan Dhan Yojana, it was said that the poor of the country will be connected to the banking system
 is yojana ke tahat ab tak 27 karod garibon ke bank acount khole ja chuke hai
 Similarly, the government set a target that in three years, 5 crore poor people will be given free gas connections, in just 10 months, nearly two crore poor people have been given gas connections
 sarkaar ne kaha tha ek hajaar din main un 18 hajaar gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaayenge, jahaan aazaadee ke 70 saal baad bhi bijli nahin pahunchi
 Electricity has been delivered to more than 12 thousand villages in about 650 days
 jahaan niyam-kanoon badalane kii jarurat thi, vahaan badale gaye or jahaan samaapt karne kii jarurat thi, vahaan samaapt kiye gaye
 So far, more than 1100 old laws have been abolished
 saathiyon, saalon tak desh main bajet shaam ko 5 baje pesh hota tha
 The British had made this arrangement because in India it was 5:30 in the morning according to Britain at 5 o'clock in the evening
 atal ji ne isamen badlaav kiya
 This year you have seen that the budget was presented a month ago
 impalimentation kii drushti se ye bahut bada parivartan he
 Otherwise, before this, the budget used to come in the end of February and months would go out to reach the departments, then there was further delay due to monsoon
 ab vibhaagon ko unki yojanaon ke liye aavantit dhanrashi samay par mil jaaegi
 Similarly, in the budget there was an artificial division of plan, non-plan
 surkhiyon main aane ke liye nai-nai chizon par Emphasis di jaati thi or jo pehle se chalaa aa rahaa he, use nazarandaaj kiya jaataa tha
 Because of this there was a lot of imbalance on the ground
 is artificial division ko khatm karke hamane bahut bada badlaav karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 This time the Railway Budget was also merged in the General Budget
 alag se rail bajet pesh karne kii vyavastha bhi angrejon kii hi banaai hui thi
 Now the dimensions of transport have changed a lot
 rail he, road he, aviation he,, water ve, samudri rasta he, in sabhi par integrated tareeke se sochna aavashyak he
 This move of the government will form the basis of technological revolution in the transportation sector
 pichley dhai varshon main aapane sarkaar kii niti-nirnay or niyat, teenon dekhi he
 i believe that this Approach for New India will take the country to new heights in the 21st century, and strengthen the foundation of New India
 hamaare yahaan zyaadaatar sarkaron kii Approach rahi he- die jalaana, riban kaatna, or ise bhi kaary hi mana gaya, koi ise bura bhi nahin maanata tha
 You will be surprised to know that more than 1500 new projects were announced in our country but they were only buried in the files
 aise hi kai bade-bade project barason se atake hue hai
 Now a system has been developed for proper monitoring of projects - 'pragati' ie pro-active Governance and Timely Implementation
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main main baithta hum or saare kendriya vibhaagon ke sachiv, saare rajyon ke chif secetry video conferencing ke madhyam se judate hai, jo project ruke hue hai unki pehle se hi ek list taiyaar kii jaati he
 So far, projects worth more than Rs 8 lakh crore have been reviewed in progress meetings
 desh ke liye bahut mahatvapurn 150 se zyada bade project, jo barason se atake hue the, unamem ab teji ai he
 The government's focus is on Next Generation Infrastructre for the country
 pichley 3 bajet main rail or road sector ko sarvaadhik paisa diya gaya he, unke kaam karne kii kshamta badhaane par bhi lagaataar najar rakhi ja rahi he
 This is the reason that the average speed of working in both the rail and road sectors has increased considerably
 pehle railway ke electrifiction kaa kaam dhimi gati se chalata tha
 The government gave impetus to the railway's route-electrifiction program
 isse rail ke chalaane ke kharch main kami ai or desh main hi uplabdh bijli kaa upyog hua
 Similarly, railways were given the facility of open access under the electricity act
 is kaaran se railway dwaara kharidi ja rahi bijli ke upar bhi railway ko bachat ho rahi he
 Earlier, the power distribution companies were opposed to this, forcing the railways to buy power from them at an expensive price
 ab railway kam daam par bijli kharid sakati he
 Earlier, the linkage of Power Plants and coal was in such a way that if the plant is in the north then coal will come from Central India and coal from North or East India will go to West India
 is kaaran Power Plants ko koyale ke transportesan par zyada paisa kharch karnaa padataa tha or bijli mahangi hoti thi
 We localized the coal linkage, which reduced both transportation expenses and time and made electricity cheaper
 ye donon udhaaharan bataate hai ki ye sarkaar Tunnel Vision nahin, Total Vision ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kaam kar rahi he
 For example, the railways did not get permission for months to build a rail over bridge to take the road from below the railway track
 maheenon tak isi baat par maathapai chalati thi ki Rail Over Bridge kaa dizin kya ho
 Now, Uniform Design for Rail Over Bridge has been made in this government and if the proposal is based on this design then NOC is given immediately
 bijli uplabdhta desh ke aarthik vikaas kii puunji he
 Ever since our government came, we have been working holistically on the power sector and are also succeeding
 46 hajaar megawatt kii janareshan kapacity ko joda gaya he
 Generation capacity has increased by nearly 25 percent
 koyale kaa transperent rup se ocshan karnaa or power plant ko koyala uplabdh karana hamaari praathamikta rahi he
 Today there is no such thermal plant, which is critical in terms of availability of coal
 critical yani, koyale kii uplabdhta 7 din se kam kii hona
 At one time there was a big breaking news that the power crisis in the country has deepened - coal is running out near the power plant

 It is worth mentioning that on Thursday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also said in Parliament that inflation will be 7 percent by the end of March, compared to 5 in the beginning of the financial year
 5 pratishat tak rahane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 The Economic Review states that due to high prices of consumer goods globally, there will be pressure on prices in the domestic market
 iske alaava kai viksit desh arthvyavastha main jaan foonkane ke liye nakadi kii uplabdhta badhaane main lage hai
 Its effect can also come in the form of rising inflation in the domestic economy
 samiksha main kaha gaya he ki antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne bhi apni taaja report main is taraf ishaara karte hue kaha he ki duniya ke ubharate or vikasshil rashtron main upabhokta mulya se judy mudrasphiti oonchi bani rahegi
 The IMF has said that there will be pressure on the market due to lack of supply and demand demand in developing countries

 Congress President Akhil Shahul Gandhi's views about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are not hidden from anyone
 chaahe desh me koi manch ho yaa videsh kii dharti, rahul ne sangh kii aalochana karne kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 Now the same Sangh is going to call the Congress President in its program
 darasal 17 sitambar se 19 sitambar tak rashtriya rajdhani dilli main 'bhavishya kaa bharat:rashtriya swayamsevak sanghaka drushtikon' naamak kaarykram main sangh, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri samet vipaksh ke kai netaaon ko aamantrit karne ja rahaa he
 Due to which the rumor has increased in opposition parties including Congress
 haalanki aresas ke prachaar pramukh arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki yah nyotaa kisi vyakti vishesh ko nahin, balki har vipakshi dal ko bheja jayega, jisamen congress bhi shaamil he or agar rahul gandhi aate hai to sangh ko koi aapatti nahin
 Let me tell you that during the debate on the motion of no confidence in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi said that no matter how much the Sangh and BJP hated him, there was no slightest hate in his heart
 or yah kehete hue rahul piem modi se gale mili
 Now it has to be seen how much Rahul is able to maintain on his statement of Parliament
 philhal sangh ne apane sabase mukhar aalochak rahul gandhi ke paale main gend daal di he
 It is noteworthy that Congress leaders, including former Home Minister p Chidambaram and former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh, had objected to former President Pranab Mukherjee's participation in the Union's third year program
 lekin rahul gandhi yaa gandhi parivaar se kisi vyakti ne pranab par tippanee nahin kii thi
 Significantly, Congress President Rahul Gandhi compared the RSS to the Muslim Brotherhood at an event in London, which drew a lot of criticism from him
 sangh ke prachaar pramukh arun kumaar ne rahul ke bayaan par kaha ki jo bharat ko nahin samajhataa wo sangh ko nahin samaj saktaa
 Let me tell you that a defamation case is going on in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra, regarding Rahul Gandhi's statement that the RSS has been convicted for killing the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne adaalat kii salaah ke baavjood apane bayaan par kaayam rahane kaa faisla liya or kaha ki ve court kii karrwai kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar hai
 However, Rahul, who has been continuously attacking the RSS over the intolerance, the assassination of Gandhi, the participation of women in the Sangh, is seen standing at the crossroad by the invitation of the Sangh
 yadi ve is kaarykram main nahin jate hai to un par ashishnu hone or sansad main apni hi kahi baat se peeche hatane kaa laanchhan lag saktaa he
 On the other hand, if they are involved in the program of the Sangh, then it can be promoted like giving recognition to the RSS
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki rahul gandhi purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii tarah sangh ke kaarykram main shaamil hone kii risk lete hai yaa nahin? The trailer of director SS Rajamouli's dream project film 'baahubali' has been released

 mayawati ne ravivaar ko yahaan party karyaalay main yojit ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki adaalat ke nazariye ko dekhakar basapa deshbhar main sarvasamaj main bhaichara or saamaajik sauhaard paidaa karne ke liye sarvasamaj bhaichara ke naam par sammelan or reliyaan karegi
 He said that the party will not abandon its social change campaign so that people of the society can truly move forward in accordance with the intent of the Constitution
 unhone kaha ki basapa kii taraf se abhi tak jis bhi samaaj ke naam par sammelan kiye gaye unhen jaateey aadhaar par samaaj main aapas baantne ke liye nahin balki sadiyon se jaateey aadhaar par bante hue samaaj ke logon ko aapasi bhaaichaare ke aadhaar par jodne ke liye kiye gaye
 The BSP chief said that the court has told all political parties not to hold a conference on the basis of caste, on the other hand, keeping the constitution in mind, our party also has to tell the court that in order to give importance to a particular religion in our country With the aim that there are many organizations like Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bajrang Dal, which in almost every election the direction of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and choose v strategy set
 adaalat ko aise sanghathanon par roak lagaani chahie
 Because the Constitution does not allow to do politics on the basis of religion
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue mayawati ne kaha ki vah bhartiya samvidhan kaa gambheertha se dhyanpurvak adhyayan jarur karen, kyonki hamaare desh kaa samvidhan hindutv ke aadhaar par nahin balki puure taur se dharm-nirpekshata ke aadhaar par hi nirmit he
 Therefore, while describing Modi as a Hindu nationalist on the political stage, the dignity of the Indian Constitution should also be taken care of

 He said that our party requested the central government to file an appeal against this decision
 tippaniyan Mayawati has condemned the terrorist attack in Bodh Gaya and has put the central government in the dock in the matter of the country's security
 vah somvaar ko bodhgaya jaaengi
 Mayawati attacked the Samajwadi Party (SP) government of Uttar Pradesh in a press conference and said that there is no law in the state
 chaaron taraf bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa he
 Mayawati said at a press conference held at the party office here on Sunday that the BSP would hold conferences and rallies in the name of Sarvajam Samaj Bhaichara to create brotherhood and social harmony in the society across the country
 unhone kaha ki party apane is saamaajik parivartan ke abhiyaan ko kisi bhi surat main nahin chhodeygi taaki sarvasamaj ke log sahi myne main samvidhan kii manshaa ke anuroop chalakar aage bad sake
 He said that all the conferences held in the name of the BSP have been done so far, not to divide them on the basis of caste, but to connect the people of the caste-divided society on the basis of mutual brotherhood for centuries

 Taking a dig at Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Mayawati said that she should study the Indian constitution seriously, because the constitution of our country is not based on Hindutva but on the basis of secularism as a whole
 isliye modi ko raajnneetik manch par apane aapako hindu rashtravaadi bataate hue, bhartiya samvidhan kii garima kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie

 congress netaa raashid alvi ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri va bijepi netaa narendra modi par us kathith daavon ke liye hamalaa bolaa ki vidhansabha chunaav main rajya main 25 pratishat muslimon ne unhen vot diya tha
 Former Congress MP Alvi said, 'this is a false and baseless statement
 puure desh main keval do muslim narendra modi ke paksh main apana vot de sakate hai
 One from Bihar (shahnawaz Hussain) and the other from Allahabad (mukhtar Abbas Naqvi)
 bijepi sutron ke anusaar modi ne party ke pradesh adhyakshon or chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke sadasyon ko sambodhit karte hue daawa kiya tha ki unhen apane rajya main 25 pratishat muslimon kaa samarthan praapt he or party ko puure desh main alpsankhyakon tak pahunch banane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 Alvi said that even if Modi's statement is accepted, how many Muslims were given tickets there that 25 percent voted for him
 unhone kaha, ‘ham yah dekh rahe hai ki paanch rajyon ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav or agle loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kitne muslimon ko ummidavaar banaati he
 'alvi said that BJP leaders are very hungry to become Prime Minister and they are not realizing their defeat in Karnataka, where he was the President of BJP Campaign Committee and there is our government

 yah kist reporting ke do bharosemand ghise-pite siddhanton se shuru ho sakati he
 First, an apology that this was my first visit to Jharkhand (or the area that was formed as the new state 14 years ago) in almost 40 years of being a reporter
 indian airlines kii us puraani isi 489 udaan se safar karte hue main yahaan 40 minute tehra jarur tha, jo tamaam jagahon par rukati hui guwahati jaati thi
 So, another well-known idea
 neeche utarate hawaii jahaaj kii khidki se yah yaad karun ki janvari 1981 main ranchi kaisaa dikhaai diya tha or ab kya badal gaya he
 But don't mind me not doing it
 mere paas or ek kargar tarkeeb he, bagal kii seat par baithe yatri ke saath baatcheet
 My co-passengers in the adjacent seat are well-known Congress leaders
 haalanki vah sudur karnataka ke hai, phir bhi unke naam kaa zikr na karnaa hi uchit hoga
 He asked me, "of course you are planning to write a book?" And then generously started giving suggestions for a possible theme of the book
 unhone kaha, ‘‘pehle aapako bananaa republic par ek kitaab likhni chahie
 The first and the longest chapter should be on Jharkhand
 is par to ek puri kitaab ho sakati he
 "going towards the airport bus, i asked," It is known that there is a mess in this state, but why Banana Republic? Literally speaking, more bananas are not grown here
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘sar, jharkhand main bilkul shanti or sauhaard he
 Here the leaders, bureaucrats, police, contractors, businessmen, mining barons, mafia, judiciary, Maoists and of course your media, all sit around a table and sort out all the issues through mutual reconciliation
 kya yah bananaa republic nahin he?’’itnaa kahkar congress netaa khisak lete hai
 Apparently he has to increase the non-existent morale of his almost non-existent party here

 But the words of that Congress leader not only ring in your ears, but also stare staringly - well where else, from the writings written on the wall

 rajya banane ke baad 14 saal main yah nau mukhyamantriyon, 14 diji police, 10 mukhya sachivon or raashtrapati shashan ke teen dauron se guzar chukaa he
 When i stopped to take a picture on my ipad, the driver, who is the most trusted political pundit anywhere in the world, and shrugged and finished the talk: "he forgot one thing, sir, even eight governors changed 
 ’’ phir vah apane pasandida akhbaar kaa bachaav karte hue kahata he, barbaadi ke saare saboot ginane ke liye ‘‘ek hording shaayad puraa nahin padataa

 It is a story of anarchy, plunder and, most importantly, political instability
 14 saal main jharkhand main jo nau mukhyamantri rahe, unamem se ek naam vayovruddh shibu sorain kaa he, jo teen baar mukhyamantri rahe
 The fourth Soren is assuredly his son Hemant, the current Chief Minister
 arjuna munda teen baar mukhyamantri rahe
 Even an independent Madhu Koda is in this list, who died in jail
 or ant main babulal marandi, jo bijepi main the lekin chhodkar baahar aa gaye-har koi maanata he ki ve sabase saaf-suthere netaa hai, lekin ve is kadar naakaam isliye rahe, kyonki ‘‘raajnneeti ke liye jaruri dhairya unamem nahin tha
 "(if you believe BJP leaders, including Sushil Kumar Modi of neighboring Bihar), or" There was a lot of cleanliness for the politics of Jharkhand
 ’’ (agar aap kisi bhi sthaneey netaa se puuchhen)
 The figures written on the walls reveal an even more interesting story
 14 saal main ye sabhi mukhyamantri adivasee rahe hai
 This can be understood, because the overwhelming desire for liberation from British colonial slavery and then from elder brother Bihar came from among the tribals
 19veen sadi main tir-dhanush se las or nange haathon angrejon se ladgaye vaali adivasee sena kii gaathaon ne hamen birsa munda kii jhakzorne vaali kinvadanti di he, jo gore hamalaavaron ke khilaaf america bashindon kii ladaaiyon kii kahaniyon se milti-julati hai

 To understand this, my education then started from a small tea shop on the roadside, which is a favorite place of a wandering reporter
 lekin yah maamuli chaay kii dukaan nahin he
 It is owned by Dayamani Barla and her husband Nelson, the staunchest advocates and activists of tribal rights in the state
 dayamani ne puunjipatiyon (khaskar el

 Freed from politics, she has returned to activism

 He started doing small wages to feed the family and soon left the world
 dayamani or unke bhai-bahanon ne skool janaa jari rakhaa, lekin jaldi hi unki maa rasoi main naukaraani kaa kaam karne ke liye ranchi aa gayi
 Dayamani says that she had seen what illiteracy did to her father

 Interestingly, his activism started not against the government, but against an NGO

 i will have many arguments about his ideas and ideology (leave all the fertile land for farming, mostly stop mining, take out external investment), but no doubt about his honesty, commitment and sense of pride among fellow tribals is

 The school was built in 1931 and should be a pilgrimage center for us hockey lovers

 This man was one of the first generations to adopt Christianity as one of the most famous tribes
 khilaadi or adhyeta ke taur par unka kariyar tab paravaan chadha, jab unke parivaar kaa dharmantaran karwaane vaale or unke skool ko chalaane vaale padri britain laut gaye or apane saath unhen bhi lete gaye
 So, in his perfect example, we also get a glimpse of a more serious flaw in our tribal society, in which the RSS and its partner organizations encounter Mubtila with Christian missionaries
 iske natijatan jo maansik or darshanik takaraav paidaa hota he, vah dharmik hone ke saath hi nasleey yaa jaateey bhi he
 From where does an Adivasi gain a sense of identity — from the God whom he has been persuaded to pray for, or from his ethnicity? It has broken the tribal population from top to bottom
 isai sabase achche skulon kaa sanchaalan kar rahe hai, jabaki aresas, apane ekal vidyalayon ke saath, unki barabari ke liye jaddojahad kar rahaa he

 The previous generations may have tolerated this, but this generation will not, because school education, engagement with the rest of the world and better income have also led to more aspirations among them

 You can see that the tribal people are also changing, even though their political leaders still have not changed

 Why did Jharkhand and especially its tribal people lag behind in spite of political power and the precious treasures hidden within the ground? Sushil Kumar Modi and bjp's intellectual spokesperson Saryu Rai point out that this is because the state's status was definitely achieved on the strength of the tribal movement, but no state level leader developed here

 udaan main mere saath safar kar rahe congress netaa kaa jharkhand ko bananaa republic kahana kyon sahi tha, adivasee shikshak ne draupadi ke saath itani maujuun langiktavaadi tulana kyon kii thi, or kyon kashyap ne is ilaake ko itnaa sahi-sahi samajha
 Even i felt scared walking alone in Wasseypur, a Muslim colony in Dhanbad, and was stopped by a close-up photograph of Don Faheem Khan's mansion
 fahim or betaa ikbaal ek virdohi ke parivaar kaa safaya karne ke aarope main jail main hai
 And i do not know if they look like Manoj Bajpayee and Nawazuddin Siddiqui or not, but i am told that they run their business with great ability even from jail
 jail unke liye sabase mahfuj jagah he
 Anyone will tell you that their "business" is of junk

 Political infighting is at a peak in Bihar
 tejasvi yadav ko jediu-argedy kaa tej badhata ja rahaa he
 In the midst of the tussle between the two parties, the flamboyant Yadav is seen standing in the middle
 jediu jahaan unhen mantrimandal se baahar karne kaa man bana chuki he, vahiin argedy kisi keemat par tejasvi kii ferevail nahin chaahati
 The question that arises in the midst of all this is that how long will the Bihar government's Naiyya survive
 yaa phir tejasvi kaa istipha hone ke baavjood bhi nitish kumaar kii mahagathbandhan vaali sarkaar chalati rahegi?ab nitish ke faisle kii ghadi bhi kareeb he
 After the meeting of JDU leaders on Tuesday, Lalu Yadav was given 4 days to act on Tejashwi
 ye miyaad shanivaar ko khatm ho jaaegi
 But before this, RJD has cleaned its stand completely
 argedy baar-baar ye kah chuki he ki tejasvi ke istife kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 On Thursday, RJD MLA went ahead and made Nitish Kumar realize his strength by telling him to have 80 mlas
 yani janata dal you or argedy apane-apane rukh par kaayam hai
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has to decide now
 ye bhi jagajaahirahai ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par nitish kumaar koi samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 RJD sources say that if Tejashwi resigns, he can present himself as a martyr
 ye he argedy kii ranneetiwahin, argedy ke ranneetikaar ye bhi maan kar chal rahen he ki nitish kumaar zyada din tak tejasvi par karrwai taal nahin sakate
 In such a situation, they are also strategizing about their options
 ranneeti ke mutabik tejasvi yadav ko agar barkhaast kiya jaataa he to argedy ke sabhi mantri bhi istipha de sakate hai
 But even after doing so, the RJD will not withdraw support from the Nitish government
 samarthan jari rakhegi argediargedy sutron kaa kahana he ki argedy janata dal united sarkaar ko samarthan detii rahegi taaki wo phir se bijepi ke saath na chali jaye
 On the other hand, RJD also does not want it to be out of the government on this delicate occasion
 kyonki lalu prasad yadav kaa parivaar sibiai or idi ke cese main fansaa he
 In such a situation, staying without government can weaken them
 haalanki, argedy congress ke saath kuch nirdaleey yaa phir jediu main yadav vidhayakon ke bharose sarkaar banane ke vikalp par bhi vichaar kar sakati he
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar will also have to think where he should go and trust him
 haalanki, bijepi ne pehle hi baahar se samarthan dene kaa sanket diya he
 Similarly, now RJD is also working on a strategy to support from outside
 aise main nitish kumaar kii kursi ghar vaapasi kiye bina bhi khisakane se batch sakati he

 Hello Ravish Kumar, 624 people have died and 9311 cases have been registered
 swine flu gujarat, rajasthan, madhyapradesh, dilli, maharashtra ke kasbon se lekar zilon tak se report hone laga he
 On Tuesday, the Union Health Minister also called a high-level meeting, but before the government system came into action, so many people died due to oblivion or the system did not give them timely relief
 iskaa hisaab kab hoga or koun karegaa
 In 2009, 3000 people died of swine flu
 15 farvari ko rajastan main 11 logon kii maut ho gai
 Nearly three thousand people have swine flu here
 jodhpur ke neshnal lau university ko 2 march tak ke liye band kar diya gaya he kyonki ek chaatr ko swine flu ho gaya
 Eight people have died of this disease in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat in the last 24 hours
 bhopal ke jepi hospital or privet astpal ke chaar doctoron ko swine flu ho gaya he
 Doctors are also caught in Delhi, but swine flu is also spreading in Delhi and Tamil Nadu
 haalanki in do rajyon main marane vaale logon kii sankhya kam he
 Probably because people are aware of the symptoms and treatment of this disease
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar ham saamaanya se saamaanya jan ko iske prati jaagruk kar den to kaaphi logon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati he
 1500 people have suffered swine flu in Delhi but only seven have died
 ham kisi kii maut kii traasadee ko ginati se kam nahin kar sakate hai par samay par ilaaj se jaan batch sakati he
 This disease is also showing how the condition of our hospitals is
 doctor or dawaaon kii uplabdhta or khaskar isiu kii sankhya ko lekar bhi sachai saamne aa rahi he
 Teams have been sent from the center in Rajasthan and Gujarat
 yani paanch saalon main bhi ham rajya str par swine flu se nipatane kii mukammal vyavastha nahin kar paae hai
 Let me tell you here that there is a medicine called Oseltamivir, Tammy Flu
 sarkaar daawa karti he ki yah dawa har jagah uplabdh he or isaki koi kami nahin he
 With this, you are seeing the people coming out with swine flu patients on TV screens

 jabaki tej bukhaar, badan dard, naak bahane par hi swine flu kaa test hota tha
 Doctors say that many may not have high fever but have swine flu
 dast bhi ab swine flu ke lakshanon main jud gaya he
 This time people want to get the test done already because they do not want to risk
 sarkari aspataalon main test free he
 But government-recognized private labs are quite expensive
 haalat ye he ki dilli ke privet lab main deshbhar se sample aa rahe hai
 Red Path Lab and Quest are being tested for Rs 5000 and Dang and Lifeline Lab for Rs 9000
 esarel religer main 7230 rupee main test ho rahaa he

 ab pehali ikai june, 2013 main shuru hone vaali he, yani agle sansadeey chunaavon ke lagbhag salbhar pehle
 Bihar has to get 50 percent of the power of this unit, due to which the project has political importance in this state facing power crisis
 koi aashcharya nahin ki vidyut ejeeniyar se mukhyamantri bane nitish kumaar parinaam chaahate hai or vah bhi thik samay par
 In November last year, the Chief Minister appointed Sandeep Pundarik, an IIT engineer and then IAS officer, as the new Energy Secretary
 jahaan pradesh sarkaar ko yah ummid he ki urja vibhaag ke kaamkaaj ko sudhaarney main unki visheshgyata kaa phayda milegaa, vahiin 1993 batch ke iees adhikari pundaric ko vidyut se sambandhit nitish ke vaade ko hakeekat main utaarne ke spasht nirdesh hai
 Yet the state government's path is not so easy
 bihar kii adhiktam maang 3,000 megawatt he jabaki bijli kii kul uplabdhta sirf lagbhag 1,750 megawatt hi he
 54
 3 megawatt kii vibhinn jalavidyut pariyojnaon ko chhod diya jaae to bihar main ab bhi bijli kaa koi utpaadan nahin karata
 But a ray of hope is also visible
 bihar main jald hi kai vidyut pariyojnaayen puri hone vaali hai
 For example, the renovation, modernization and expansion of Kanti and Barauni thermal power plants of the State Electricity Board will generate about 1,000 MW of power
 uske baad baadh super thermal power plant se utpaadit bijli kaa aadha hissaa, 1320 megawatt bhi bihar ko hi milanaa he
 Not only this, Bihar will continue to purchase 1,000 MW of power from Adani Power for the next 25 years from 2014 under an agreement
 phir 2015-16 tak 1,980 megawatt vaale nabinagar super thermal power plant ke bhi puraa ho jane kii ummid he
 It is estimated that by 2015 power demand in Bihar will reach 4,000 MW
 sanyogvash 2015 main hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 If everything goes according to plan, by then Bihar will become a surplus power state and 5,000 MW power will be available in Bihar including internal generation, share from central sectors and purchase from private sector

 ) Protests in Delhi Cantonment by Delhi Congress against sealing happening in the capital Delhi
 is pradarshan ke dauraan congress ne bijepi par hamalaa karte hue dilli main ho rahi ceiling ke liye use jimmedaar tehraaya
 The Delhi Congress has once again taken to the streets against the continuous sealing in the Delhi Cantonment area and staged a strong protest against the BJP
 is dauraancongresspradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan kaa kaha ki ceiling kaa mudda sirf dilli kaint kaa nahin balki puri dilli kaa he or iske liye bijepi or kejariwal donon jimmedaar hai
 Ajay Maken said that these two parties are the same people of the same plate and are misleading the people of Delhi
 unhone kaha ki congress is mudde ko lekar janata ke saath khadi he or ceiling ke khilaaf vah virodh pradarshan jari rakhegi
 Not only this, the Congress also protested against the sealing, as well as charging the people living in the Delhi Cantonment area Rs 5000 on behalf of the Cantonment Board in the name of Swachh Bharat Tax
 ajay maakan kaa kahana tha ki cantonment board dilli kaint kii janata ko swatchta ke naam par jabaran tex vasuul rahi he or safai ke naam par board puri tarah se fail he
 Accusing the BJP, Maken said that the Central Government takes cess in the name of cleanliness, but is not able to give salary to the employees of the scavengers, in which the BJP is only working to rob the public
 congress kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki agar unke dwaara uthaaye gaye muddon par dilli sarkaar or rajya sarkaar ne koi kaarywahi nahin kii to wo raksha mantri ke karyaalay tak ja kar pradarshan karegi
 The opposition of the Congress was also on the removal of the voters' list from the people living in many areas of the Cantt area

 aisi hi ek chhavi maine bana lee thi, apane hindi teacher sudesh pachori ke bare main
 This is the time when i attended graduation in Zakir Hussain College in 2004
 meraa admician sports cote se hindi onors main hua tha, lihaaja mujhe yahi lagata ki hindi padhanaa bhi mahaj gilli danda kaa khel hai
 While living in this thinking, i used to practice sportsmanship and never went to the class of Hindi
 agar vakt mil bhi jaataa to main canteen main baithkar dosti yaari nibhaataa rahata tha
 One day my Hindi teacher reached Sudesh Pachauri in the canteen and he asked me 'mr, are you a student of Hindi Honors?' My answer was yes
 itane main doosraa sawaal bhi aa padaa, 'kitni classes ab tak aapane atend kii hai? is par maine badi hi aasaani se kah diya ki main sports cote se aayaa hum to meraa kaaphi vakt khel ke maidan main gujarata he or uske baad class atend karnaa mushkil he
 Hearing this, he went quietly but the next day he said to take the Hindi test, which was to be given to everyone
 mujhe khabar to mil gai thi or main bina kisi dar ke pahunch bhi gaya kyonki ab tak mere andar sports cote se admician hone kii khumaari chadhi thi
 The test was finally done and the results were also announced
 puri class main mere sivaa sabhi paas the
 In the correct sentence, i was the only student who failed
 is par bhi mujhe koi fark nahin padaa kyonki sports person ko padhanaa jaruri nahin hota main is khushvahami main ji rahaa tha
 Time passed and the final exam time came closer
 mere andar kii beficri abhi bhi barkaraar thi
 One day my teacher called me again and said that your presence is not in the class, in that sense you cannot sit in the exam
 meri akal or akad donon hi kam nahin hui thim
 So i said what difference do sports quota attendees have
 ve to aasaani se mil jaaegi
 After this i met the teacher of sports but they raised their hands saying that i can show 40% attendance but for 20% you have to go to Hindi class
 aakhirkaar haarkar main apni hindi class main pahunch hi gaya
 First day and today Sudesh ji was also fully prepared
 meri dhang se class lagi or aisa do din tak chalaa
 After this i thought to talk to the teacher, to be honest, here too i went to meet thinking that i will find a way out of the conversation
 lekin vahaan jaakar jo hua wo meri soch se pare tha
 Sudesh ji met me in a very simple way
 maine hindi ko lekar apni baat rakhi
 Then he said that your problem is that you understand Hindi very easily, whereas it is not so
 bhashaa kii izzat karnaa siikho
 i sat near him for a long time, he told me about himself and also about Hindi
 uske baad mere andar ek badlaav tha
 i used to go to class every day and in the final exam, the student who failed the test also got 50%
 yah baat maine unhen bataai, jis par unhen khushi se zyada garv tha
 Today, many years have passed on this matter, but they grew day by day in respect of Hindi
 yahi nahin meraa yah najariya bhi badal gaya ki insaan kii pahchaan uskaa pahanava nahin, asal main uski soch hoti he

 The Chief Minister has written in the letter that due to the closure of grain, the supply of 655 tonnes of rice received from the Center to 471 recognized institutions and the Central Government has also stopped, which will affect 43,640 people
 inamen anusuchit jati, janajati, pichhadaa varg ke chaatr or duusare vanchit tabakon ke log shaamil hai
 Says Raipur's philanthropist Vikrant Sharma, "the concern of the two party leaders is not about the closure of these Dal Bhat centers, but that who will be able to surround them on this issue

 koun-koun pahan saktaa he muunge kii maala-agar yaaddasht kamazor ho, padhai main bachche kamazor ho, bachche kahana naa maanate ho, kundali main buddhi kaa grah budh kamazor ho, gyaan kaa grah guru kamazor ho to muunge kii maala pahanani chahie
 Wearing coral garlands makes Mars strong
 lekin maala dhaaran karne se pehle is maala kii hanuman mandir main puja jarur kara len
 Coral garland enhances self confidence- With the coral garland one can chant the mantras of Hanuman ji and Shri Ram
 - agar suhaagin stri muunge kii maala pahane to unke pati kii sehat thik rahati he
 - Their every crisis ends and Lord Hanuman always protects the whole family
 muunge kii maala kab pahanen-- tulsi kii maala muunge kii lakdi se laal dhaage main banaai jaati he
 - It should be worn on Tuesday
 - dhaaran karne se pehle hanuman ji, shiv ji or shri ram ji kii puja kerani chahie
 - Wearing a coral garland does not make one look and one gets all kinds of happiness
 - ise gangaajal se dhokar, dhoop deep dikhaakar pahanen
 - Wearing coral garland can not consume mass wine and cannot lie

 yahi nahin, unhone bina naam liye hi ishaaron main aamir ko salaah di ki unhen desh kii pratishtha ke bare main keval auto rickshaw chaalkon ko hi nahin, balki apni patni ko bhi gyaan dena chahie
 Addressing the students at Delhi University's SGBT Khalsa College, the BJP leader gave his views on several issues
 unhone aword vaapasi ko desh kii asmita se jodate hue kaha, 'sarkaar yah sunishchit karegi ki bhavishya main puraskaar vaapasi kii jarurat nahin ho
 He said that no compromise would be made on the security of the country's borders and its self-esteem
 bharat main saath kaa dashak azaadi ke baad ke pehle mohabhang kaa dashak bhi tha
 The dreams seen in the era of independence were from tiredness
 azaadi kii ladaai ladane vaali peedi vidaa ho chuki thi or uski kamai khaane vaale log har taraf ubhar rahe the, china yuddh ke baad kii hataasha or nehru ke nidhan se paidaa shunya ke bich bhartiya raajnneeti khud ko punarparibhaashit or punarvyakhyayit karne kii chunauti se guzar rahi thi
 In this era, Lohia and his socialist concerns related to village-countryside and backward were on one hand and on the other side was the emerging Jana Sangh which still chanted a united India and sometimes raised the slogan of hindi-hindu, Hindustan
 is nae sire se sangharshrat bharat main jo kuch chamakate chehre bhavishya ke prati aasthaa jagaate the, unamem jorge furnandis bhi ek the
 They had risen like a comet
 shuruyaat unhone mazdoor andolan se kii thi
 He was the leader of the Taxi Union of Mumbai
 tab unke ek ishaare par mahanagar kaa chakkaa jam ho jaaya karata tha
 In 1967, he entered the Lok Sabha by defeating Maharashtrian SK Patil

 com / djqqyktfxyesake patil azaadi kii ladaai ke netaa rahe, nehru, laal bahadur shastri or indira gandhi kii sarkaar main mantri rahe or unhone kalpana tak nahin kii thi ki unhen dakshin mumbai main haraaya bhi ja saktaa he
 But they lost and George came across as a sensation
 sattar ke dashak main is sansani ne bataaya ki vah dirghajivi jwalamukhi hai
 The way he went on strike with 15 lakh railwaymen before the Emergency is remembered as a myth in the history of the labor movement
 isi tarah immergency ke dauraan jail main rahete hue unhone mujffarpur seat se jis tarah jeet hasil kii, vah bhi raajnneeti kii baar-baar duharai jane vaali kahaniyon main he
 Among the leaders of that era, apart from Atal, he was the other whose speech style was discussed separately
 unhen 'daayre main band toofaan' kaha jaataa tha
 Two-three things about George were very clear
 ve ladanaa or jujhna jaanate the
 He did not take time to connect with the poor, laborers and common people
 ve apni tarah ke jazbaati sarvhaara the
 They used to give hope
 unka saahas bilkul romaanch kii had tak chalaa jaataa tha
 The Baroda Dynamite case is seen as an example of his audacity
 indira gandhi kii sarkaar ko ve fasivadi sarkaar maanate the or ise hataane ke liye ve dynamite tak ke istemaal kii soch sakate the
 When the Janata Party government was formed in 1977, George was made the Minister of Industry
 unhone jo ahm faisale kiye, unamem cocacola jaisi badi company ko bharat se bhagaanaa bhi tha
 It is a different matter that coca-cola returned to his life after nearly two decades
 baad main rail mantri, raksha mantri sab kuch banate gaye
 But George's entire politics shows how the big firebies of possibility in Indian democracy changed into cold parts of agreements
 is raajnneeti kaa adhyayan yah samajhane ke lihaaj se dilachasp ho saktaa he ki aakhir fasiwad or sampradayikta ke khataron se ladane niklaa bhartiya samaajwaad kaise unki hi god main jaakar baithta chalaa gaya
 In fact, these days those who put communism and socialism in exactly one political line may not know that at one time the Indian Socialists used to tease the Congress and the Indian Left in such a way that they did not even bother to come close to the Jana Sangh
 lohia kaha karte the ki poonjeevaad or samyawad donon bharat par hamale ke aakiri europea hathiyaar hai
 George, associated with the labor movement, considered China as a great threat to India and was willing to join hands with anyone who was badly offended by Indira Gandhi and the anti-democratic individualist attitude of the Congress
 1977 kii pehali janata party sarkaar main jorge-madhu limaye or atal-adwani kaa saath aana isi vidambnaa kaa ek rup tha jiske khataron ko tab kisi ne pahachaanaa nahin tha
 The truth is that George's political acrobats begin from this period
 1979 main jab janata party tuuti to jorge ne 24 ghante main paala badla
 a day earlier, strong arguments were made in favor of Morarji's government and the next day he appeared in another court
 beshak, yah samjhautaparasti se zyaada taatkaalik raajnneetik dabaavon ke akalan kii hadabadi thi jisase jorge ne yah faisalaa liya
 Such decisions become more visible in the coming days
 khaas kar 90 ke dashak main unhone lalu yadav ke bhrashtachar or parivaarwaad ke kilaaf pehle samta party banaai or uske baad bijepi se haath mila liya
 George is suddenly seen changing here
 vah aag buji hui si nazar aati he jiske bich unka sulagta hua vyaktitv banataa tha
 He also becomes the defense minister of the Vajpayee government and also the Sankatmochan
 achaanak ham pate hai ki odisha main fadar jorge sten or unke bacchon ko zindaa jala kar maar die jane kii ghatana se bhi ve aprabhavit rahete hai
 They go to the center and investigate and return with a clean chit to everyone
 kya yah puraane jorge se sambhav tha? vah hota to aag laga dene kii sochataa
 The intolerance that is being discussed today started at the same time when the first NDA government at the Center was formed under the leadership of the Prime Minister, who was considered liberal
 lekin vah ek mukhauta bhar the, yah baat kisi or ne nahin, us govindacharya ne kahi thi jo un dinon bijepi or sangh parivaar ke niti nirdharakon main pramukh hua karte the
 Needless to say that this mask is filled to the hut today
 baharhaal, kargil ke samay bhi jorge ke kuch bayaan hairaan karne vaale rahe
 Later, due to Tehelka's sting operation, he also had to resign for some time
 ve dubaara laute, lekin unako lekar sansad main takaraav chalata rahaa or ve isse beasar rahe
 a leader who dreams of fighting the forces that weaken democracy and create a socialist India, one day suddenly goes to the other end and becomes the partner of the same forces that are weakening the democracy - no matter how depressing
 , But reading it like a personal overthrow of George's politics would have exposed many of the questions that led to the situation that many people The Eme moved into the camp
 yah vah traasadee he jo bharat main loktantr ko fasiwad ke lagaataar majboot hote jaal se bachaane kii chunauti ko bada bana rahi he
 Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on # georgefernandes: It is very sad news
 He was like an elder brother to me
 Our association started when i joined Janata party
 When i met him i felt i was meeting my hero
 He was a simple man
 He did a lot of work in the Defence Ministry

 com / jejrtkmjgv When George came into politics, there was a kind of disillusionment
 unka aana jitna naatakeey tha, unka janaa utana hi anaatakeey rahaa
 He continued to breathe breathlessly for years away from the torture of memory
 vismriti kii bhi koi yatnaa hoti he yaa nahin, yah nahin maaloom, lekin jorge sabakuch bhul chuke the- vah bahut kuch bhi jo vaaki bhuulaa jane laayak tha
 But we have to remember - what were the irony that caused a big and likely leader of our childhood and teenage days to drift away from us
 lekin yah unke vyaktitv kaa hi jaadu tha ki unase asankhya shikaayatein raheen, lekin koi shikaayat kisi shatru-bhav main nahin badal saki

 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has given a new argument on the debate over Aadhaar
 unhone kaha ki privesi ke naam par innovations (navachaar) kii hatya nahin kii jaani chahie
 Actually, the central government is linking all welfare schemes with Aadhaar, which is opposed by many people
 inkaa kahana he ki aadhaar surakshit nahin hai
 This is a violation of the fundamental right to privacy
 haal hi main aadhaar data ke li hone kii bhi khabaren aa chuki hai
 a petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court regarding this
 hindustan times ke mutabik ravishankar ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main yah bhi aashwaasan diya ki aadhaar nahin hone par kisi ko kalyankari yojana kaa phayda uthaane se vanchit nahin kiya jayega
 He said that the biggest concern is being expressed about the fact that by applying Aadhar card for welfare schemes, the poor will suffer the most
 haalanki aisa nahin hai
 Food will not be denied to poor due to not having an Aadhaar card

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki koyala blaak aavanton ko lekar kaig kii report main aniyamittaaon ke jo aarope lagaae gaye hai ve tathyon par aadhaarit nahin hai or saraasar bebuniyaad hai
 After making a statement in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister also made a statement in the media outside the Parliament House
 unhone unki 'khamoshi' par taana kehane waalon ko jawaab dete hue sher padhaa, 'hazaron javaabon se acchhee he meri khamoshi, na jane kitne sawaalon kii aabru rakhi
 Singh said in his statement on the CAG report in both the Houses of Parliament that i want to reassure the honorable members that as the Minister in-charge of the Ministry of Coal for some time out of the period mentioned in the report, i will take decisions of the Ministry
 i take full responsibility of main kahana chahta hum ki aniyamittaaon ke jo bhi aarope lagaae gaye hai ve tathyon par aadhaarit nahin hai or saraasar bebuniyaad hai
 He also described the three main objections made in the CAG report as 'clearly controversial'
 uparokt report par unase istife kii maang kar rahe mukhya vipakshi dal bhaajapa ko bhi aade haath lete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki samprag kaa shashan aane par koyala blaakon kaa aavanton pratispardhi boli se karne kaa prastaav hua tha lekin vipakshi dalon ke tatkaaleen shashan vaale chhattisgarh, jharkhand, odisha, rajasthan, pashchim bengal aadi rajyon ne pratispardhi boli prakriya apnaane kaa purajor virodh kiya tha
 He said that the then Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje, in a letter written to her in April 2005, opposed the competitive bidding, saying it would be contrary to the spirit of the Sarkaria Commission's recommendations
 singh ne kaha ki isi prakaar chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne june 2005 main bheje patr main maujuuda niti jari rakhane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 He said that similarly the then Left Front-ruled West Bengal and bjd-ruled Odisha governments had written letters to him formally opposing the competitive bidding system
 singh ke mutabik vipaksh shasit rajyon kaa kahana tha ki pratispardhi boli ke jariye koyala blaak aavanton se koyale kii keemat badhegi jisase unke kshetron main udyogon ke vikaas par pratikul prabhaav padegaa or pattedhari kaa chayan karne sambandhi unke visheshadhikaar bhi kam honge
 The Prime Minister made a strong comment on the CAG going out of its jurisdiction, saying that in any situation in a democracy it is difficult to accept that any decision on the government's legal reforms to implement a change in policy is audited Adverse comments should be made
 koyala blaak aavanton main pratispardhi boli ke liye vidheyak main aavashyak sanshodhan main vilamb ke bare main kaig kii tippanee par unhone kaha ki kaig report main is nirnay ko teji se lagu nahin karne ke liye sarkaar kii aalochana kii gayi he
 i fully agree that if it were possible to work by order only then we could have done this work much faster, but it is difficult to do so in view of the complex process of consensus building in our parliamentary system
 unhone kaig kii report main aavanton par mukhya teen kaarnon se jataayi gayi aapattiyon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki kaig kii tippaniyan spasht rup se vivaadaaspad hai
 These are the three observations of the CAG, the inquiry committee did not adopt a transparent and impartial methodology while making recommendations for allocation of coal blocks
 maujuuda prashasnic nirdeshon main sanshodhan kar 2006 main hi pratispardhi boli shuru kii ja sakati thi lekin lambii prakriya apanaayi gayi jisase nirnay lene main vilamb hua
 The third main objection to the report is that the delay in introducing competitive bidding led to many private companies getting around 1 from the current process
 86 lakh karod kaa aarthik laabh hua
 The Prime Minister said that the policy which the CAG has criticized has been in existence since 1993, long before the UPA government
 unhone kaha ki ek antar mantralayan jaanch samiti kii sifarish ke aadhaar par 1993 se hi koyala blaakon kaa aavanton kiya ja rahaa tha
 The committee also had representatives from state governments
 unhone kaha ki koyala evam captive kol blaakon kii teji se badhati maang ko dekhte hue samprag
 The government first considered allocation in June 2004 through competitive bidding
 singh ne kaha ki kaig kaa yah kathan doshapurn he ki maujuuda prashasnic nirdeshon main sanshodhan karke 2006 main pratispardhi boli shuru kii ja sakati thi
 He said that a meeting was held in the Prime Minister's Office on 25 July 2005, which was attended by representatives of coal and lignite states
 baithak main rajya sarkaron ke pratinidhiyon ne pratispardhi boli apnaane ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya tha
 In the statement, he said that after the meeting it was seen that it would take a long time to bring in the legislative changes required for the proposed change and the allocation process of captive mining could not be held back for so long in view of the increasing demand for coal, hence the meeting It was decided that until the new competitive bidding process becomes prevalent, the coal blocks through the existing screening committee process s allocation may be continued and the Center and related collective decision of the state government

 During this time, there is constant pressure on you to keep your income sources intact, because you have to pay a huge amount from your total monthly income every month as EMI payment
 iske baavjood kabhi halaat main koi baari ulatpher ho jaae or apni EMI kaa bhugtan karne main sakasham nahin rahete to aapke saamne vaaki ek badi samasya he
 This problem worsens if your unemployment period is prolonged
 aamtaur par in halaaton main aapke paas lone par lee hui us sampatti ko ghate main bechney ke sivaae koi vikalp nahin hota
 In such a situation, you become a bank loan defaulter and the credit rating is damaged
 lihaaja, aapaki koshish rahati he ki pareshaani kii is ghadi main aap kis tarah se apana financial management karen
 However, in such a situation there are other options for you which you can try with the opinion of your financial advisor
 gauratlab he ki bank teen maheene tak lagaataar iemai main difolt hone par aapako difolter ghoshit karata he or aapke viruddh koi karwai shuru karata he
 1
 immergency fund or nivesh:aise najuk halaat main aapako apane paas padaa koi purana nivesh yimergency fundka rukh karnaa chahie
 According to financial advisors, employed people should make a fund of 6 times their monthly salary
 yah fund aapaki kam avadhi kii berogari main aapako sambhaal saktaa he or nai naukari milane tak aap apni iemai kaa bhugtan is fund ke jariye kar sakate hai
 2
 phixd diposit or mutual fund:yadi kisi kaaran aapke paas immergency fund nahin he to is surat main aap apane dwaara kiye gaye nivesh jesephixd diposit or mutual fundko bhunaa sakate hai or iemai bhugtan karne or masik ghar kharch ke liye fund bana sakate hai
 3
 insurance skim:aamtaur par home lone lene ke pehle log kai tarah kii aisi insurance skim main nivesh karte hai jisamen bachat kaa bhi praavdhaan rahata he
 Many insurance schemes may give you low returns but you can use them to take a loan
 lihaaja, home lone ke difolt se bachane ke liye aap apane dwaara lee hui in skiimon kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 Financial experts generally believe that people should invest in 3-4 such schemes
 4
 Provident Fund: According to experts, if you are not able to adopt the above methods then you should turn to your provident fund
 aamtaur par is fund ko chune se log kataraate hai kyonki yah aapke ritairement ke liye kii gai jamaa puunji he
 But, by default in bank loan, when you do not have any option, then you pay your EMI using it
 yadi aap 5 saal kii naukari kar chuke hai to is fund se nikasi par aapako kisi tarah ke tex kaa bhugtan nahin karnaa hoga, lekin nai naukari milane ke baad aapako nayaa provident fund acount khulwaanaa padegaa
 If you cannot adopt all these methods, then in this case you should talk to the bank directly
 bank ke paas adhikaar rahata he ki vah aapaki iemai ko kuch avadhi tak roak sake yaa rifinancingh kaa vikalp de de
 In this case the bank can extend the duration of your EMI payment
 financial maamalon ke zyaadaatar jaankaron kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki yadi aap ne mahaj nivesh ke liye kisi sampatti ke liye lone liya he to is surat main aapako sidhe saste dar par lee hui sampatti ko bechakar apane lone ko band kar dena chahie

 The governor directed Manohar Parrikar to be the next Goa appointee to pass the floor test within 15 days
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle parrikar ne 21 vidhayakon ke dastakhat vaala samarthan patr governor ko saunpa tha
 The Congress went to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Governor of Goa where it got reprimanded
 supreme court ne bhi apane faisle main jald se jald floor test kii baat kahi he
 Meanwhile, a Congress MLA has also targeted the Congress
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rajya main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta party ke netritv se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 Leaders believe that the Congress took a late decision in forming the government and did not get too serious in contacting the smaller parties, due to which the BJP was defeated

 We cannot blame any one, but this is a big lapse

 Kumar said on Thursday that in the Hajipur village of the city Kotwali area, on Wednesday evening, a young man named Golu entered a girl's house and sprayed kerosene on her and set it on fire, the girl was referred to Lucknow today in a serious condition
 The condition is said to be critical
 unhone bataaya ki golu pichley kuch vakt se ladki ko buree najar se dekhtaa tha or do din pehle usne uske saath budtamiji bhi kii thi, jiskaa ladki ne virodh kiya or aaropee ne buudhvaar ko ladki ko ghar main akelaa paakar vaardaat ko anjaam diya or ghatana ke baad se aaropee laapata he
 Kumar said that the girl's family has accused the police of not filing a case and it will be investigated and strict action will be taken if any negligence is found by the police
 kya aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki khud ko duniya kaa sabase bada or mahaan loktantr kaa dhindhora peetane vaale bharat kii sansad main bangladesh, pakistan, afghanistan, srilanka or chini mul ke ummidavaar chunaav jitkar pahunch jaaen
 India currently has no such example apart from Sonia Gandhi
 britain main hue chunaavon main jis tarah asian mul ke logon ne fatah hasil kii he vah ham bharatiyon ke liye aainaa he
 The Parliament of Britain and America is full of such examples and we are one that keeps judging one's patriotism on the basis of birthplace, giving citizenship and making every effort to keep it away from institutions
 aakhir britain kii janata or vahaan kii sansthaaon ko hamaare yahaan jaisaa khatara kyon nahin hota he? vahaan kii janata kii paripakvata yaa aatmavishvaas hamase zyada kaise he ki ve duusare deshon se aae logon ke bacchon ko apana baccha samajhate hai or pratinidhi chunate hai
 We will have different types of parties with sticks and start telling them that one day their population will increase, one day they will become a threat to Parliament and then the country
 in dalon ko britain main jaakar prachaar karnaa chahie tha ki pleez aap asian mul ke logon ko vot mat do
 They are a threat to patriotism
 britain main to yahaan tak kaha ja rahaa he ki ek din hamaara pradhanmantri asian mul kaa hoga
 This thing is not being said to scare, but Britain is waiting for that moment of glory
 vishwa guru or shakti banane kaa sapana sanjone vaala bharat kya kabhi aisa aatmavishvaas dikhaa paaegaa
 After all, what is the nationalism of Britain, which does not fear finding out the birthplace of its citizens
 bharat main jaise hi sonia gandhi ke pradhanmantri kii baat hoti he hamaara loktantr sakapaka jaataa he
 Even after being a citizen, the debate about the origin of Sonia Gandhi goes on that she is fine till MP but how can a foreigner become Prime Minister
 ham samvidhan ke die naagarik adhikaron kaa bhi sammaan nahin karte hai
 After the UPA victory in 2004, Sushma Swaraj immediately announced that if Sonia Gandhi became the Prime Minister, she would turn her head
 2013 main bhi loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan sushamaa swaraj ne phir kah diya ki main abhi bhi is raay par kaayam hum ki sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri nahin bananaa chahie
 It is another matter that immediately Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the issue of Sonia Gandhi's Italian origin is now dead
 yah mudda mara he yaa nahin iskaa pramaan turant mil jayega bas koi kah de ki sonia gandhi pradhanmantri banengi
 Will see how the statement comes
 agar ham britain yaa america kii sansad main bhartiya mul ke logon ke jeetne par itnaa gaurav karte hai to kya ham vahi gaurav duusare mul ke logon ko de sakenge
 Will a person of Chinese origin win the election from any seat in Delhi
 koi party tikat dene kaa bhi saahas karegi
 No election passes in which the issue of Bangladeshi citizens does not arise
 iskaa ekmaatr makasad hota he bhartiya musalamaanon ko sandigdh kar sampradayik dhruvikaran karnaa
 This time in the UK parliament, Tulip Siddique, niece of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has won
 alan mak chini mul ke pehle british saansad bane hai
 Mak has said that there is no need to celebrate much about his origin
 main britain main paidaa hua hum or yahi meraa mulk he
 Obviously, authority or attachment to the country is not due to birthplace
 britain kii cricket team main hi kai baar aisi vividhta dikh jaati he, jise lekar ham punjab se lekar dilli tak main jashn manaane lagate hai
 Can you imagine Nasim Shah of Pakistani origin as his representative, whose mother has gone to jail for murdering her tortured husband
 bharat main aisi prishthbhumi kaa koi ummidavaar aa jaae to uske maa baap ko hi mudda bana denge or bheed ko uksaaya jane lagegaa ki apradhi parivaar kaa saansad banegaa to vahi karegaa jo ek apradhi karata he
 However, our record in making criminals MP should not be worse than any other country in the world
 lisa nandi vigan se or seemaa malhotra south west landan se saansad bani hai
 Suella Fernandes is an MP from Fairham and Priti Patel from Witham
 alok sharma riding west se to virendra sharma ealing southol se saansad bane hai
 Rishi Sunav, son-in-law of Infosys founder Narayana Murthy, has also been elected as an MP
 shailesh vaara ko british janata ne cambristshar north west se apana saansad chunaa he
 If you are proud of these names, then the same pride will have to be returned to the history of the world
 america britain yaa kahin bhi duusare deshon ke mul ke logon kaa chunaa janaa bataa rahaa he ki saansad hone yaa loktantric sansthaaon ko chalaane kii zimmedaari yaa paatrata kisi ke janmasthan ke mul se nahin tay hoti he
 Patriotism will not be defined on the basis of birthplace, rather it will be a measure of one's civic duty
 ek bade desh kii pahchaan sirf vasudaiv kutunbakam kehane se nahin hoti he
 He will also be identified with the fact that he will give the citizens of other countries on their land the civil rights to reach the highest positions
 is maamle main bharat abhi mahaan nahin hua he
 We cannot be happy with two or four examples of the past
 hamen apane doharepan se nikalnaa hoga
 It cannot be that Indians in other countries are happy to reach the summit and no other country in their country can reach the Parliament to do its politics
 britain kii sansad main is baar bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina kii bhatiji tulip siddiq jiti hai
 Alan Mak became the first British MP of Chinese origin
 mak ne kaha he ki unke mul ko lekar zyada utsav manaane kii zarurat nahin hai
 i was born in Britain and this is my country
 zaahir he mulk par adhikaar yaa usase lagaav sirf janmasthan ke kaaran nahin hota hoga
 Such diversity is often seen in the British cricket team itself, which we start celebrating from Punjab to Delhi
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki pakistani mul kii naseem shah ko bhi vahaan kii janata ne apana pratinidhi chunaa he, jinaki maa apane atyaachaari pati kii hatya ke aarope main jail ja chuki hai
 If a candidate of such background comes to India, his parents will make it an issue and the crowd will start to be encouraged that if the criminal becomes the MP of the family, then he will do what a criminal does
 haalanki aparaadhiyon ko saansad banane ke maamle main hamaara ricard duniya ke kisi desh se karaab nahin hona chahie
 Lisa Nandi has become MP from Vigan and Seema Malhotra from South West London
 suela fernadis fareham se or priti patel vitaham se saansad bani hai
 Alok Sharma has become MP from Riding West and Virender Sharma from Ealing Southall
 infosis ke sansthaapak narayan murti ke damaad rishi sunaav bhi saansad chune gaye hai
 Shailesh Vara has been elected by the British public as his MP from Cambridgeshire North West
 in naamon se garv ho rahaa he to yahi gaurav bharat ko bhi duniya ke itihaas ko lautaanaa hoga
 The election of people of origin from the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the United States is telling that the responsibility or eligibility to be an MP or to run democratic institutions is not determined by the origin of one's birthplace
 deshbhakti janmasthan ke aadhaar par paribhaashit nahin hogi balki iskaa paimaana hoga kisi kaa naagarik kartavya
 a large country is not identified simply by saying Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 uski pahchaan is baat se bhi hogi ki vah apni zamin par duusare mulkon ke logon ko sarvocch padon par pahunchane ke naagarik adhikaar degaa
 India has not become great in this matter
 ateet ke do chaar udaahranon se ham khush nahin ho sakate hai
 We have to get out of our duplicity
 yah nahin ho saktaa ki duusare mulkon main bharatiyon ke shikhar par pahunchane se khush hon or apane mulk main koi duusare mulk kaa sansad tak main na pahunch paae isaki raajnneeti karen
 Indian National Lok Dal supremo Omprakash Chautala will have to hold an election rally
 dilli hai court ne chautaala ko tihaad jail main sarender karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Chautala was granted bail at the Health Ground but he held an INLD election rally in Jind on Thursday
 chautaala apane pita or purv up pradhanmantri devilal ke 100wein janmdiwas par jind main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 The CBI informed the court today that Chautala rallied
 aise main unhen jail main rakhaa ja saktaa he kyonki court ne unhen medical grounds par jamaanat di he
 On the information of the CBI, the court ordered Chautala to be surrendered to the officers of Tihar Jail
 chautaala ke vakil ne is par 20 dinon kii mohalat maangi
 Chautala will now surrender on 17 October
 haryana main jebiti shikshak bhartee maamle main sibiai court ne chautaala ko 10 saal kii sajaa sunai he

 dilli hai court ne unhen rashtriya rajdhani kshetra se baahar nahin jane or kisi raajnneetik jansabha ko sambodhit na karne ke halafname daayar kiye jane ke baad hi sashart jamaanat di he, lekin chautaala na keval raily main aae balki unhone raily ko sambodhit bhi kiya jo sidhe-sidhe adaalat ke aadesh kii avmaananaa he
 Friday morning in Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh was very challenging for some officials
 kyonki unhen 18 gaanvon main jaakar yah jaanane ko kaha gaya tha ki vahaan log khule main shouch to nahin karte
 The officials handled this responsibility well and also shared photos of some people through social media (whats App) to the Chief Development Officer, who are now being processed

 And then reporting started by chance
 ' The CDO said, 'members of the Cleanliness Campaign Monitoring Committee caught many people in their area defecating in the open
 kai ko aisa karne se roka gaya or phir gaanv waalon ko khule main shouch karne se hone vaale nuksaanon ke bare main chetaya gaya
 ' unhone bataaya ki ab tak jile ke do gaanv puri tarah se is kupratha se mukt ho chuke hai tathaa 16 anya chaynit gaanvon ko bhi is kupratha se mukt karne ke liye yuddh str par prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Soon there will be success
 tippaniyan Varma said that by April 15, these villages will be freed from defecating and a target has been set to include 150 villages in the district by Independence Day (august 15)

 ek taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi pramukh nadi ganga ko pradooshan se mukt karaane or uski safai ke liye karodon rupye kii yojanaayen banavaa rahe hai, vahiin duusari ore lupt saraswati nadi kii sahaayak maani jane vaali or rajasthan kii maru ganga kahi jaati rahi luni lupt hone kii kagaar par he
 The situation is so bad that the catchment area of the river is reduced by encroachments and small dams meant for irrigation
 jodhpur main isaki sahaayak nadi jojri to balotra main luni nadi ke basin par sthit rangai-chapai factriyon se nikle pradooshit pani kii vajah se yah barbaad ho gai he
 Due to water barriers, the rain water in this 530 km long river is not reaching the end
 ajmer se shuru hone vaali yah nadi barmer ke gandhav se hote hue gujarat main kuccha ke ran main samaapt hoti he
 The flow area of this river used to be 37,363 sq km, which is very limited
 sukadi, mithdi, khaari, bandi, jawai or jojri jaisi isaki sahaayak nadiyaan bhi atikaraman kii bhent chadh gai hai
 The situation in Balotra area of barmer is that the raw water has poisoned the fresh water of the land
 isse jahaan logon main bimaariyaan faili hai to jal mafia kai saal se logon ko meetha pani dene ke naam par lut rahaa he
 Luni was a symbol of prosperity for Balotra till the beginning of the textile industry here
 2012 main jodhpur haai court ne nadi ko bachaane ke uddeshy se nadi main kisi bhi prakaar ke pradooshit pani ko chhodie par roak laga di thi
 But due to the negligence of the administration, that decision could not be implemented
 sarkaar ne balotra main textile udyog se hone vaale pradooshan ko rokane ke liye bade water treetment plant bhi bana rakhe hai par ye bhi asafal sabit ho rahe hai
 Polluted water coming from the textile factories of Balotra is stored in these plants
 barish kii aad main unheen plants se luni main pradooshit pani daalaa ja rahaa he
 The Pollution Control Board is taking very small action against the units leaving the untreated water in the Luni area in Balotra
 july, 2014 main balotra main board ke kshetreey adhikari ke rup main charge sanbhaalane vaale ech
 R
 ksaana kehete hai, “ham hycourt ke adeshon kii puri paalna karvaa rahe hai
 Some units are releasing water without treatment
 isaki jaankaree milane par ham turant karrwai kar rahe hai
 ”(bandi, a tributary of Luni in Pali, has been transformed into dirty sewer) The situation is almost the same in Pali district
 luni kii sahaayak nadi bandi bhi textile ikaayiyon se pradooshit pani se barabaad ho chuki he
 Pollution water has also been filled in the Nehra dam, 40 km from here
 kisaan paryaavaran sangharsh samiti ke adhyaksh mahavir singh shukrlai kehete hai, ''paali main lagbhag 600 vastra audyogic ikaiyaan hai
 Due to their polluted water, serious diseases are spreading in humans as well as silent animals and birds
 ” mahavir bataate hai ki rajya pradooshan niyantran mandal ne 23 march, 2014 ko aadesh jari kar kaaman efluent treetment plant (siitipi) ko rifus karne kaa notice diya tha lekin aaj tak aisi ikaayiyon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui
 Thus the catchment area of jaswantasagar, the largest dam in Luni's drainage area, used to be 3,367 sq km till three decades ago, but its storage and fixed filler capacity has drastically decreased
 udgam sthal se baandh ke bich nadi ke hisse ke rup main mul cachament main kareeb 62
 Small structures have either been built or encroached upon in 2 per cent area
 mul cachament 3,367 varg kimi ke mukaable is vakt keval 1,272 varg kimi aria hi upyogi rah gaya he
 However, there is a dire need for Luni's protection, otherwise the industrial competition will swallow him up

 If the Congress wins the Lok Sabha elections, then Rahul Gandhi will become the Prime Minister of the country, hence the poster of the future Prime Minister has been put up

 slamdog milenier film ke geet jai ho ke bol logon ko behad bhaae
 The pearls as they came out were from the pen of Gulzar saheb
 slamdog milenier ko superhit kaa khitaab dilaane main geetkaar gulzaar kaa yogadan bhi kam nahin he
 Gulzar saheb with white shirt and pajama and sweet smile on his face is being conquered all over the world
 unke gane jai ho ne dhooma machaa di he
 There is only one echo around the world
 jai ho, jai ho
 Gulzar's hail also resonated at the Oscars
 
 
 ab to har kisi kii jubaan par chadh chukaa he jai ho gaanaa
 Gulzar has always been known for his songs, new experiments in his films
 slamdog milenier main bhi unhone apane bolon main us tabake kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa
 
 jiske upar bani he slamdog milenier
 Gulzar saheb died in each song of the song
 shaayad isiilie jai ho gane ne gulzaar sahab ko pehali baar antarrashtriya puraskaar auskar tak pahunchaaya
 The song of Jai Ho, which came out of Gulzar's pen is a chore for the common man, so the color of literature has also emerged in the imagination of Gulzar as sky-awakening awning gulzaar kii jai aaj bhale hi unke geet kii vajah ho rahi ho lekin ye bhi sach he ki gulzaar jaisaa geetkaar shaayad aaj doosraa koi nahin
 His inner aspect of human being is also exposed in his songs, which is not possible to see even with naked eyes
 slamdog milenier ke duniyabar main mashhoor hone ke peeche gulzaar ke geeton kaa bhi utana hi haath he, jitna film ke baaki pahaluon kaa
 Although Gulzar's name may have gone from Jai Ho to the Oscars, but Gulzar is the name that Jai has been celebrating for the last several decades and will continue to be for many centuries

 Input: PTI pregnancy main morning sickness hona bahut hi saamaanya baat he
 During this time, problems like vomiting, dizziness, loss of appetite occur
 subah kuch der ke liye ye problem hona normal he lekin aapako dinabhar aisa hi lage to ye chintaa kii baat ho sakati he
 In most cases of pregnancy, these symptoms occur in the initial third and fourth months, but some women have to face this problem for a full nine months
 yun to morning sickness koi beemaari nahin he lekin ise lekar bahut adhik laaparvaahee dikhaanaa khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 There are many types of changes in the body in pregnancy and morning sickness is due to that change
 morning sickness agar lambey samay tak bani rahati he to iskaa bura asar bachche par bhi pad saktaa he
 Tips to remove morning sickness: - Get up from the bed early and walk some steps at home
 - khaali pet rahanaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 If you have a problem of morning sickness, then wake up in the morning and eat something then do some work
 - subah uthakar organic tii len
 This will give energy
 - apni diet main bahut adhik tali or bhuni chizon ko lene se bachein
 - Do not allow calcium and vitamin deficiency in the body
 kai barmahilaayein morning sickness dur karne ke liedwaiyaan lenaa shuru kar detii hai
 But it is wrong to do so
 pregnancy main kisi bhi dawa ke seven se pehle doctor kii salaah jarur len varanaa iskaa bura asar bachche par bhi ho saktaa he
 The wedding season is there and big cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Surat, and bullion markets are closed to even small towns
 jo log ratti or tola jaisi baarik maatra main jevaraat ko gande main lage rahete the, ve log, kareeb ek pakhwaade se, bhaanti-bhaanti ke binar poster banaakar apni shilpkaaree kaa parichay de rahe hai
 To make your performance stronger than the rest, the method of being impregnated is being adopted, and somewhere the yagna-havan is being done for the mental purification of the government
 dilli main pragati maidan ke railway overbrij par tange vishaal binar main ise 'sarkari aatankwaad' tak ghoshit kar diya gaya
 But what really happened? Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has imposed an excise duty of 1 percent on gold and other precious jewelery in the budget presented on 29 February
 saath hi do lakh ru
 Use of PAN card was made compulsory for jewelery purchases over Rs
 sarkaar ne spasht kiya ki sone-chaandi or jevaraat ke kaarobaar main paardarshita laane ke liye ye kadam uthaae gaye hai
 In 2012, in the era of the UPA government, a similar proposal came in the budget, which was later withdrawn under the pressure of bullion market
 lekin is baar sarkaar atal he
 The government may not have said that it is an initiative to curb the use of black money in the sale and purchase of jewelery in the country, but it is actually a step in that direction
 yah maani hui baat he ki dhan kaa jo bhi len-dein hisaab-kitaab se baahar hota he, asal main vah kaala dhan hi he, bhale hi rakam zyada ho yaa kam
 It is interesting that neither the government nor the bullion traders are using the word 'black money'
 sarkaar ise paardarshita kah rahi he to virodh kar rahe sarafa vyapaaree ise inspector raaj kii vaapasi kah rahe hai
 Surendra Kumar Jain, vice president of All India Sarafa Association said, "this is a direct return of Inspector Raj
 sarkaar jab tak 1 fisadi utpaada shulk waapas nahin legi hadtaal jari rahegi
 But the harassment of gold-silver businessmen and the poor artisans associated with it will not be tolerated
 '' ol india jecwas and jewelri federation ke chairman shridhar ji
 V
 ne bataaya, ''ham ghaataa uthaakar bhi hadtaal jari rakhenge
 We have suggested to the government that if it wants to increase customs duty, excise duty should be removed
 '' sarafa vyapaariyon or sarkaar ke bich ab tak kii baatcheet naakaam rahi he
 According to the bullion traders, a strike of 15 days costed 20,000 crore
 kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he, yah rakam ganga ke liye paanch saal tak aavantit rakam ke baraabar he
 At a huge gathering held at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, bullion traders warned of intensifying the movement
 inspector raaj aa jane ke sarafa vyapaariyon ke andeshe ko dur karne ke liye central board for exise and custom (sibiisi) ne 4 march ko spashtikaran jari kiya
 It clearly states that Rs 12 crores
 salanaa se adhik kaa kaarobaar karne vaale sarafa vyapaariyon ko hi ek fisadi kaa utpaada shulk chukaana he
 6 crores to traders with a turnover of less than 12 crores
 tak ke kaarobaar par utpaada shulk se chhot milegi
 This practically means that if a businessman is 10 crores
 salanaa kaa kaarobaar karata he to use chaar karod ru
 The excise duty is to be paid only on the business of yah raahat kitni badi he, ise samajhaate hue sibiisi ke ek adhikari ne bataaya, ''kutir udyogon ko bhi sirf 1
 5 crores Rs
 ke kaarobaar tak hi utpaada shulk se chhot milti he
 Cottage industries are considered to be in the category of weakest industry
 isaki tulana main sarafa kaarobaar ko to chaar guna zyada chhot mili he
 "to remove the queries of the traders, the government has made it clear that the businessmen can get their business details deposited by a Chartered Accountant, and in no case the inspector will come to check on their shop
" sarkaar ne vyapaariyon kaa yah andeshaa bhi dur kiya he ki unhen apana stock bataanaa hoga
 Although this language has been used in government explanations to 'remove the obsession of the inspector state', it may have hidden the indication that the government is not being as strict on domestic black money as traders understand
 lekin vyapaariyon ko in sab baton par yakeen hi nahin ho rahaa
 "the government keeps saying lakhs, but we have seen Inspector Raj," says a real businessman from Meerut
 agar koi inspector jaanch karne aata he, to yah gaiyr-kanoonee to hoga nahin
 Most of the small goldsmiths or jewelers are working in cash, except for gold merchants
 hamaare saath saakh or udhaar kaa dhandha bhi chal rahaa he
 Artisans get remuneration according to the market
 ham kis-kis cheez ko kanoonee jama pahanaate phirenge
 "traders are afraid that even if the small businessman does not have to pay excise duty, he will have to keep an account of whatever business he declares
 iskaa matlab he ki kahaan se sona kharida or kise bechaa yah bataanaa padegaa
 Upwards of two lakhs
 se upar kii bikri par pan card kaa istemaal anivaary he
 How will all this work be done in cash transaction? However, Sridhar says, "jewels have many parts in each piece
 inhen alag-alag logon ne banaaya hota he
 Keeping an account of each part of the jewelry is a difficult task in itself
 iske liye alag se logon ko kaam par lagaana hoga
 It is impossible for a small bullion trader to do so
 ''isiilie kaarobaari puri takat se virodh karne main jute hai
 Till now, businessmen who have been performing at the state level are now directly surrounding the central government in Delhi
 yahaan congress or aam aadmi party kaa unhen puraa sahyog mil rahaa he
 The grassroots leaders of BJP are understanding the damage done by this movement that BJP has the strongest base in this business class
 bijepi netaaon ko yah bhi ashanka he ki iskaa asar duusare vyapaariyon par bhi padegaa
 But the Prime Minister's intention to make the economy more transparent and curb black money, nothing is available

 Swayambhu Sant Rampal, who showed his eyes to the law, has reached behind bars
 rampal kii giraftaar ke baad se haryana samet samooche bharat main hadakamp machaa hua he
 The court and police have taken strong action against Rampal who sow thorns of hypocrisy, hypocrisy and prapancha
 haryana ke deron par court kaa danda chalaa he
 In the Rampal case, the government Anupam Gupta requested for a report on all the dera and ashrams running in Haryana
 police aise vivaadit deraa or ashramon kii jaanch kar rahi he or isaki report court ko di jaaegi
 Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, which run the business of misdeeds under the guise of faith, have many ashrams and dera where arms and ammunition are used illegally

 Babagiri will be closed? After Rampal's arrest, all other dera may also get a shock
 ek anumaan ke mutabik punjab or haryana main kareeb 9000 dere hai
 That is, every village has more than one camp on average
 yahaan aise kuch deron kaa zikr karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he jo vivaadon main rahe hai
 The biggest name is of Dera Sacha Sauda, which is run by Guru Ram Rahim in Sirsa
 deraa par 160 saadhuon ko napunsak banane kaa aarope he
 The dera is also accused of having a private army
 deraa ne haryana main haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Baba Mansingh's camp is in Kurukshetra, Haryana
 iskaa sikh dharm ke logon par zyada asar he
 a few years ago, this dera was in the news due to a rape case
 punjab ke jalandhar main ek aisa hi ashram he divya jyoti jagriti santhaan
 This ashram has a conflict with Sikh institutions
 rajya ke tarantaaran main pichley maheene hi ek takaraav hua tha
 It is also said to have a private army of armed men
 punjab ke hi ludhiana main namdhari parampara kaa ek deraa he

 is deraa kii bhi nijee sena he
 Baba Bhaniarawala has a camp in Ropar
 iske sansthaapak piyaara singh bhaniyarwala par sikhon ke pavitra granth guru granth sahib ko jalaane kaa aarope he
 The court has sought a report on all such deras
 yani kuch na kuch to gadabad jarur he

 The Jan Lokpal Bill has that power
 isi kaaran se ham is kanoon ko lagu karne ke liye sarkaar par dabaav daal rahe hai
 He supported the provision of severe punishment to prevent corruption, saying, "why should there not be life imprisonment for it?" In fact, we are saying that the corrupt should be hanged
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘bhrashtachar main lipt vyakti se raashi baraamad karne kaa praavdhaan hona chahie
 Just sending the guilty person to jail will not be enough
 raashi bhi us vyakti se baraamad honi chahie

 If his son is the Health Minister of Bihar, is it appropriate to deploy dozens of doctors only for minor diseases like cold, cough and diarrhea while misusing the post
 modi ne kaha ki aijimes main vaise hi doctoron kii kami he aise main bechaare doctoron ko aath-aath din tak awaas par tainaat karnaa kahaan tak uchit he
 Modi said that if Laloo Yadav was seriously ill, then why was he not taken to Delhi by air lift, should have been hospitalized, that means he was not seriously ill
 agar gambhir biimaar the to jo seva aspataal main ho sakati he wo ghar par nahin
 Somebody is sick like JP, it is too old that it is not possible to go to the hospital, in such a way, should half a dozen be given the service of the entire IDI, i will not oppose him for Lalu ji
 lekin maamuli beemaari hui aisi beemaari to roj-roj netaaon ko hoti he
 In such a situation, stop IGISS daily and put all the doctors in Lalu's family
 modi ne kaha ki agar unkabeta swasthya mantrin bhi hota or ve purv mukhyamantri na bhi hote, agar koi purv vidhayak bhi he to uski seva honi chahie, puri chikitsa honi chahie
 But the question is whether he was seriously ill, if he was seriously ill then why not he was taken from Delhi Air Ambulance, and why not admitted to ICU here
 ye pramaan hota he ki wo gambhir biimaar nahin the, agar wo gambhir biimaar hote or aijises ko band karke saare doctoron laga di jaae ek darjan nahin 50 doctor laga di jaae lalu yadav kii jaan bachaane ke liye main uskaa samarthan karuunga
 But this is an old-time zamindar and new king
 betaa swasthya mantri he or pita ji agar itane biimaar the to baap kii chintaa ke bajaaye dushman maaran jaap kara rahe the, or bihar ke marijon ko aise chhodkar asi gadee main baithkar vrundavan chale gaye
 They are joking
 bihar kii kshavi aisi chizon ke liye badnaam hoti he, lalu ji jab mukhyamantri the to kapadaa faad holi hoti thi
 What did not happen
 phir bihar un puraane dinon par laut kar aa gaya he

 If not this joke, what is happening? to nitish ji bihar kii kshavi ham logon ke kaaran nahin jin logo ke aap saath hai jinhen sangrakshan de rahe hai unke kaaran bihar kii kshavi kharaab ho rahi he

 In the New Year, a decision of the Modi government has brought great relief to China and America
 darasal, china, europea sangh or america se aaayaatit coted paper par bharat anti dampig charge nahin lagayegaa
 The DGTR, the investigation arm of the Commerce Ministry, has found that the domestic industry has not been affected due to the alleged dumping
 yah kaagaj magazine, kitabon, calendar aadi kii printing main istemaal hote hai
 "we do not consider it appropriate to impose anti-dumping duty on imported paper from the US, China and the European Union," the directorate said in the notification
 in deshon se kaagaj ke aayaat main mahatvapurn vruddhi hui he lekin gharelu udyog kaa utpaadan girane ke chalate yah jaruri tha
 The complaint was filed by the Indian Paper Manufacturers Association on behalf of Built Graphics Paper Products, a subsidiary of Ballarpur Industries, to DGTR
 is shikaayat main dijitiar main aavedan karke in deshon se aaayaatit coted kaagaj ke aayaat par damping rodhi jaanch shuru karne kii maang kii gai thi
 The Directorate General of Trade Remedies, after its anti-dumping investigation, said that there is no direct link between the large amount of coated paper from these countries and the loss of domestic industry
 is faisle ke baad coted paper ke saste hone kii sambhaavna he 
 There will be a charge on this product, recently it was reported that the Modi government is preparing to impose anti-dumping charge on synthetic rubber imported from China
 mukhya rup se is rabar kaa istemaal vaahan or anya udyogon main hota he
 The Finance Ministry has to take a final decision in this regard
 yah charge 18 maah ke liye lagaaya jayega
 Earlier in the month of December, India extended the time limit for the ban on the import of food products like milk and chocolate made from China
 bataa den ki yah pratibandh sitambar 2008 main lagaaya gaya tha
 At the moment, Devendra Fadnavis is seen as the lone leader of Maharashtra
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii siton main kami kaa nateeja yah hua ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne unhen mukhyamantri ke rup main duusare kaarykaal ke liye hari jhandi dikhaane se manaa kar diya
 Fadnavis calls Thackeray a 'close friend', but he is failing to get close to Thackeray demanding equal participation in power
 fadanvis kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa or shivasena ne mukhyamantri pad main saajhedaari kii charchaa kabhi nahin kii thi
 His attitude gave reasons for Thackeray to doubt the intentions of the BJP
 unhone turant apane vishwast sahyogi or rajyasabha main party ke netaa sanjay raut ko rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke pramukh sharad pavaar ke paas gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon kii talash ke liye bhej diya
 Raut returned and claimed that the army had the support of 161 mlas
 unhone 4 november ko patrakaron ke saamne elaan kiya, ''aglaa mukhyamantri nishchit rup se shivasena se hoga
 Raut's mathematics is based on the argument that NCP (54 seats) and Congress (44 seats) will support Shiv Sena (56 seats)
 saath hi 7 nirdaleeyon ke bhi samarthan se vah sarkaar bana legi
 An NCP leader said that the party can form a government with the army which the Congress should support from outside
 hoshiyaari se kaam lete hue pavaar ne sena kaa saath dene kii sambhaavna se na to inkaar kiya or na hi samarthan
 He also met Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on November 4 and told reporters, "we have not received any proposal from the Shiv Sena about the alliance at the moment
 aisi sthiti main ham koi faisla kaise le sakate hai?''rajnatik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki ensipi-sena main gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko hawa dekar pavaar thakare ko bhaajapa ke saath tagdi saudebaaji karne main madad kar rahe hai
 Indicating a slight leniency in its stand, the BJP has also tried to show leniency to the ministries and said that it could talk about handing over the ministry to the army except the chief minister's chair and home department
 fadanvis ab bhi maanakar chal rahe hai ki ve sarkaar bana lenge
 On November 4, he said, "I will not give any feedback about who is talking about the equation of power
" maharashtra ko jald se jald nai sarkaar kii jarurat he or uskaa gathan sheeghra hoga
 Fadnavis met BJP President Amit Shah on 4 November
 unhen ummid thi ki shah maharashtra main naiya paar lagane main madad karenge
 But Shah refused to intervene and asked him to settle the matter at the state level
 rajya main bhaajapa ke varisht netaa nitin gadakari, ekanath khadse or pankaja munde bhi unki koi madad nahin kar rahe
 So Fadnavis is left alone
 vaise jal sansaadhan mantri girish mahajan jaise unke saathi jor dekar kehete hai, ''ve akele nahin pade hai, mere jaise kaaryakarta unke saath hai
 "the second week of November will be important in determining the direction of the future politics of the state
" maujuuda vidhansabha or fadanvis kaa kaarykaal 8 november ko khatm ho rahaa he
 If the ncp-sena forms a government together, the Supreme Court's decision in the Ram temple case of Ayodhya will also play an important role in whether the Congress will support the right-wing Shiv Sena
 sena ke sansthaapak bal thakare kii punyatithi 17 november ko he
