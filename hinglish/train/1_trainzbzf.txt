 kebisi (KBC) main guuruuvaar ko bihar kii rajdhani patna main shikshika sangeeta kumari hotsit par pahunchi
 Here he also shared the story of his hard work by Amitabh Bachchan
 unhone bataaya ki ve apana bhavishya doctorl main bananaa chaahati thim, lekin aarthik tangi ke chalate vah apana sapana puraa nahin kar pain
 Sangeeta Kumari won 12 lakh 50 thousand rupees in KBC
 unhone 25 lakh rupye ke sawaal par game quit karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 His question was for 12 lakh 50 thousand rupees - in the name of which scientist there is no chemical element in PERIODIC TABLE
 sho ke rule ke hisaab se is sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye sangeeta ke saamne chaar opshan rakhe gaye the- A
 Albert Einstein, b
 albert nobel, C
 Thomas Edison, d
 enrico fermisangita ko sahi jawaab nahin pataa hone ke kaaran unhone quit karne kaa faisla kiya kyonki unke paas ab koi lifeli bhi nahin bachi thi
 Well the correct answer to this question was- Thomas Edison
 haalanki agar vah is sawaal kaa jawaab detii to bhi galat hota
 Because the answer he gave was not correct
 thags of hindustan ke sawaal par kya bole amitabh?sangeeta kumari 9veen or 10veen ke bacchon ko science padhaati hai
 In the show, Sangeeta was asked the question of the film Goliyon Ki Rasleela ram-leela
 is sawaal ke jawaab ke baad sangeeta ne big bi ko bataaya ki unhone ye film nahin dekhi he
 Amitabh Bachchan was also surprised to know this
 iske baad sangeeta ne bataaya ki unhone amitabh bachchan kii film thags of hindustan jarur dekhi he
 After this, Amitabh said in a mild manner, we will not talk much about this film because it did not go unfortunate
 amitabh bachchan kii ye film pichley saal relies hui thi
 Made in a budget of about 250 crores, the film starred Aamir Khan, Fatima Sana Sheikh and Katrina Kaif, but the film did not like the audience
 box offis par yah film badi flop sabit hui thi
 You say that you are called after your evil characters
 isse khij hoti he?jab aap khalanaayak banate hai to is chhavi kaa asar padataa he
 Even highly progressive ad filmmakers do not take any villain in advertisements
 kabhi chhavi se bandhane kaa ehsaas hua?maine apni chhavi khud banaai or isamen bana rahaa
 i wanted to make a brand
 mujhe khushi he ki main yah kar paaya
 i am glad of it
 nabbe ke dashak main aap hollywood gaye to aapane kya alag karne kii koshish kii thi?mujhe lagata he ki maine sahi vakt chunaa tha
 This was not a personal victory
 maine unka parichay shandaar bhartiya cinema se karavaaya, jiske bare main unhone suna bhi nahin tha
 How do i like my work? To be honest, i start seeing flaws in it as soon as the work is over
 main sochataa hum, aah ! ise behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Regret on what he did as a villain on screen - abusive and physical violence acts with female characters
 mujhe lagata he ki vah bhi maine maryaada main rahakar kiya
 If there was an alternative, i would have chosen such filmmakers who would have asked to reduce such scenes

 Vishal told Fox-23, 'he (the doctor) told me that i had an infection in my nose and because i was on the operating table and was unconscious, he had to take a decision

 haalanki ye saare daawey tab fail ho jate hai jab sote samay apane kharraaton yaa duusari aadaton ke chalate aapako koi disturb kare
 After this, quarrels and arguments begin
 jaaniye wo tareeke, jisase bilkul bhi disturb ho aapaki neend
 
 
 1
 ek bada bed khariden:research ke mutabik, koi bhi shaks raat main sote samay kam se kam 60 se 70 baar karavat badalata he
 In such a situation, if the bed is small, then the sleeping person is bound to have problems
 isse bachane ke liye bada bed khariden
 2
 takie kaa istemaal karen:agar sote samay aapkaa sathibechainimahasoos karata he or haath-paar jhatakane lagata he to isse bhi aapaki neend disturb hona swaabhaavik he
 To avoid this, you sleep with a pillow in the middle of the bed, which will keep the distance
 3
 Keep two quilts: If your partner pulls a quilt or blanket at bedtime and your sleep is disturbed, the best solution is to buy two quilts or blankets
 4
 Hybrid Bed: This bed is such that you can adjust its softness according to yourself
 isse aapaki neend bilkul disturb nahin hogi
 In this, you can also set a movement, so that the movement of one of the movements will not be known to the other
 5
 Take a break on snoring: In a survey conducted on about 1100 people, it was found that due to snoring, the partner's sleep is disturbed and many nights have to stay awake
 doctors ke mutabik, sone se pehle sharaab yaa aisi duusari chizon ke seven se bachein
 This will not hurt you and will not snore
 6: set karen do alarm:sote samay achaanak phone yaa aapke partner kaa alarm bajataa he to jhunjhalaahat hona tay he
 If your timing is different then set different alarms
 khaskar silent alarm kaa istemaal karen
 This will not only wake you up but the partner's sleep will not be disturbed either
 7
 Do not make a relationship: According to the latest research, couples fall asleep quickly after having a relationship, especially men
 doctoron kaa maananaa he ki aisa lagaataar hone se kisi ek ko samasya hone lagegi or aapke rishton main kadavaahat aegi
 Therefore, it is not a bad idea to talk to each other or to grow a good book if you do not sleep

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne piem modi (PM Modi) par hamaal bolaa he
 He said on Monday that the public has only one solution to avoid the lies of PM Modi
 or vah yah he ki janata is chunaav main piem modi ke hothon ko leukoplast lagaakar sil kar de
 By doing this, PM Modi will not be able to lie
 siem (mamata Banerjee) kaa yah bayaan piem modi ke pashchim bengal ke duusare daure ke baad aayaa he
 At a rally in Cooch Behar, PM Modi said that today the situation in West Bengal is such that people are speaking more modi-modi than didi
 or is vajah se mukhyamantri kii raaton kii neend ud gai he
 During his rally in Nagarkata, Mamata Banerjee said that Modi did not have time to focus on the problems of farmers and the middle class as he was busy wandering the world for four and a half years during his five-year tenure
 banerjee ne aarope lagaaya ki jab chunaav najadik aa rahe hai to modi har kisi ko daraa dhamka rahe he or jhooth bol rahe hai
 He claimed that if there was a competition for lying, Modi would get the first prize
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav main log unke hothon par leukoplast chipka denge taaki ve jhooth naa bol paaen
 For the sake of the country, he should not only be removed from the chair (prime Minister's post) but also from politics
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki paanch saal ke dauraan vah saadhe chaar saal duniya ghoomte rahe
 When farmers across the country were committing suicide, what were they doing? What were people doing when people were dying due to demonetisation and crores lost their jobs? Significantly, this is not the first time that Mamata Banerjee has attacked PM Modi
 isse pehle unhone kaha tha kiunhone (mamata Banerjee)piem modi ko 'expyri babu' kaha tha
 Mamata Banerjee had said that she is an expiry babu and her government is also going to expire after a few days
 West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on PM Modi: He is an expiry babu
 his govt has expired
 you(pm) said in Siliguri that we(tmc Govt) did not do anything for poor, what have you done in the last 5 years? Don't speak lies everyday
 pic
 twitter
 com / gdsodzv8r1 He said that PM (PM Modi) said in Siliguri that TMC has not done any work, i ask you what you have done in five years
 main bataati hum ki aapane sirf jhooth bolaa he
 Addressing a public meeting held in Cooch Behar district, Mamta claimed that her government in West Bengal has done many welfare works for the people
 unhone kaha tha ki unke shashan main bengal main kisaanon kii aay main teen guna vruddhi hui he
 While mocking Prime Minister Modi as 'expiry babu' and 'expiry PM', Mamata Banerjee challenged him to have an open debate on TV or in public meeting
 unhone kaha tha ki main modi nahin hum, main jhooth nahin bolti
 He had alleged that the Prime Minister lied about tmc's actions in West Bengal
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki modi ke shashan main desh main 12,000 kisaanon ne khudakushi kii
 This counterattack by the Trinamool supremo came after the attacks by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a BJP rally in Siliguri and Kolkata
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle piem modi ne mamata banerjee par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhen speed braker kaha tha
 PM Modi said that there is a speed breaker in West Bengal, which you know as Didi
 didi ko garibon kii chintaa nahin he
 After all, Didi has to do politics of poverty, how can she work to end poverty? If poverty will end, then Didi's politics will end
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki pashchim bengal main chitfund ghotaalaa hua
 Didi's ministers, Didi's legislators, Didi's companions ran away, taking the money of my poor brothers and sisters, they looted the poor
 garib kii chintaa ko samajhate hue centre kii endie sarkaar ne ayushmaan bharat yojana shuru kii
 The poor had said that up to Rs 5 lakh treatment will be free in case of illness, you will not have to spend a single rupee in the hospital
 kin speed braker didi ne kya kiya? garib kaa bhala karne vaali is yojana par pashchim bengal main brake laga diya
 Didi has also put a break on the development of more than 70 lakh farmer families of West Bengal
 desh ke tamaam rajyon main piem kisaan sammaan yojana ke tahat kisaanon ke bank khate main sidhe paise transfar kiye ja rahe hai
 But the sister is a sister
 piem kisaan sammaan yojana par bhi unhone pashchim bengal main brake laga diya
 Here, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will also start her election campaign from Cooch Behar in North Bengal on Wednesday
 mamata kii raily kooch bihar ke dinahataa main hogi
 According to Trinamool Congress leaders, Mamata was first to start her campaign on April 4, but later decided to start the campaign a day before taking on the BJP directly

 Praveen Togadia, who was sidelined by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, is now fighting for his survival
 swami chinmayanand ne saaf taur par kah diya he ki praveen togadiya kaa viechpi se ab koi lenadena nahin he
 After this, Togadia has tried to show that he is the President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad by sending an invitation letter to the media for an event held in Mumbai on 14 January
 media ko nimantran patr bhej kiya daawadrasal, togadiya ne 14 janvari ko mumbai main amrit mahotsav samiti kii ore se yojit kaarykram kaa ek nimantran patr media ko bheja he
 In this, Togadia has been described as the International Head of VHP as a special guest

 a photo has also been sent along with this letter, in which Togadia is seen sitting next to Sadhvi Ritambhara
 togadiya ne yah patr or photo bhejkar daawa kiya he ki ve hi vishwa hindu parishad ke adhyaksh hai
 Togadia, who is isolated, is said to have separated himself from the entire controversy, not only by the RSS but also by the VHP after allegations such as Praveen Togadia hatched a conspiracy against the government against him and for an encounter
 Praveen Togadia currently has nothing to do with VHP
 swami chinmayanand ne kya kaha thailahabaad main hone vaale sant sammelan main swami chinmayanand ne kaha ki togadiya kaa vishwa hindu parishad se ab koi sambandh nahin he
 There is no place for indiscipline here
 unhone togadiya ke chunaav karwaane ke faisle ko bhi galat bataaya

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray gave some similar indications at the press conference on Friday
 unhone daawa kiya ki do dinon ke bheetar donon dalon ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar ghoshnaa ho jaaegi
 Uddhav Thackeray's statement shows that Shiv Sena's stand on the issue of seats is not obstinate but soft
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne yah bhi kaha ki gathbandhan main siten usee formule par bantengi, jise loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or siem devendra fadanvis ke saath meeting main final tay kiya gaya tha
 Let us know that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena contested on 23 seats, while BJP contested on 25 seats
 is prakaar loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi bade bhai kii bhoomika main thi
 The way Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has spoken about the distribution of seats in the assembly on the basis of the formula for the Lok Sabha elections
 isse sanket milte hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi bade bhai kii bhoomika main rahete hue zyada siton par chunaav ladegi
 However, Shiv Sena has been demanding equal seats in the east
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi bijepi ne uski maang ansuni karte hue apane se do kam siten di thim
 The Shiv Sena feels that the bjp's political position has been strengthened due to the overwhelming majority in the coalition's Taktalok Sabha elections and several major decisions taken by the Modi government within a hundred days
 ise shivasena bhi bakhubi samajhati he
 This is the reason why she does not want to be stubborn about seat-sharing in the alliance
 kyonki shivasena ko bhi pataa he ki akele dam par vah sarkaar nahin bana sakati or satta main aane ke liye bijepi kaa saath jaruri he
 According to sources, due to this, Shiv Sena is willing to accept less seats than BJP
 2014 ke chunaav main shivasena akele chunaav ladi thi
 Only 63 were won when candidates fielded 283 seats
 vahiin bijepi ko tab 122 siten milin thim
 After the elections, both the parties formed a government in Maharashtra by forming an alliance

 manyata he ki inke daant nahin hai
 According to the scriptures, Lord Shankar broke the tainted legend of Pushan that Pushan had gone to join the Daksha Yagya, but in the Yajna, Shiva's wife Uma surrendered her body to the fire of the yagna
 vahaan inhone shankar bhagwaan kii hansi udayi thi
 It is also mentioned in Taittiriya Samhita that he did not have teeth, but the story is different
 kehete hai ki devataaon dwaara die gaye havirbhaag ko khaane se inke daant tut gaye the
 The mention of breaking his teeth by Lord Shankar is like this in the scriptures: Pushapanatya: Pishtado Bhagradanto Bhabwat
 yosau dakshay kupitan jahaas vivruthdvaj:
arth- santanheen pusha ne ek baar bahut badi bhul kii thi
 Lord Shankar came to destroy Dakshayagya
 tab pushan daant dikhaakar hans rahe the
 This provoked Shiv
 unhone inke daant hameshaa ke liye tod die
 According to the legend, the glory of Pushan is found in the Rigveda
 rugveda ke 8 sookhton main pushan devtaa kii mahima kaa bakhaan miltaa he
 Like Rudra, he too has shaved and shaved

 India has maintained an unbeatable order in their ICC World Cup matches against arch-rivals and arch-rivals Pakistan at the cricket ground
 bharat ne ravivaar ko manchester ke old trevord maidan par khele gaye mukaable main pakistan ko 89 ranon se haraate hue lagaataar 7veen jeet darj kii
 Every strategy of Pakistan team proved to be unsuccessful in this epic
 7 maichon main pehali baar toss jeetne ke baad gendbajitos jitkar pehle fielding karne kaa faisla captain sarfaraj ke liye kaal sabit hua
 Earlier, the same team won the first World Cup in 6 World Cup matches
 is baar pakistan ne toss jeeta, lekin gendbaaji kaa faisla kiya
 Captain Sarfraz Ahmed's decision overshadowed him
 agar paak captain sarfaraj ahamed toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte to parinaam kuch or bhi ho saktaa tha
 Captain Sarfaraz, who did not listen to the advice of the Pak PM, captain Imran Khan, who won the World Cup in Pakistan in 1992, made several tweets before the match
 unhone apane twit main pakistan cricket team ko salaah di
 Imran Khan said that given today's match, both teams will be under a lot of mental pressure
 aise main aap apane dimag par kaise control karte hai, ye dekhne vaali baat hogi or yah match kaa parinaam tay karegaa
 He had said that we are lucky that we have an adventurous captain as Sarfaraz
 aaj unhen apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Imran Khan had told the Pakistan captain via tweet what he should decide to do if he wins the toss
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne sarfaraj ko salaah dete hue kaha tha ki jab tak pich nam nahin hoti, toss jitkar ballebaaji kerani chahie
 Pakistan team, which also looked weak in fielding, ignored the advice of the Prime Minister and the Pakistan captain decided to bowl even after winning the toss
 is wicket par pehle ballebaaji karnaa kargar sabit hua
 Team India benefited from the lack of moisture on the pitch
 saath hi team india ke ballebaajon ne bhi sooyeeboojh ke saath khelaa
 The Pakistani pace attack was battered in front of the Indian batsmen
 iske alaava fielding bhi pakistan kii acchhee nahin rahi
 Rohit Sharma could have been run out at the start of the match, but the Pakistan team missed this chance and Rohit Sharma scored a magnificent century (140)

" ’ The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had complained to the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police that in the name of playing a Ranji Trophy match, some people had taken lakhs of rupees from the young players of Delhi
 iske baad police ne dhokhadhadi or aapraadhik sajeesh kaa maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 After the case of forgery in cricket, the crime branch of Delhi Police has started preparing to clamp down on the accused

 Not only is the coach and cricket association member on the radar, the network extends to Jamshedpur and Ranchi in Jharkhand
 in jagahon ke kai khilaadiyon se match khelaane ke naam par 10 lakh se 25 lakh rupee tak rakam vasuuli gai

 While giving a welcome statement, k Srinivasarao, secretary of Sahitya Akademi, said that the creator is not only made bigger by his works, but by how many new creators he has placed, influenced and moved in literature, he is also recognized and remembered
 is
 aadarneey nemichandra jain ji aise hi rachanaakaar the
 Jain gave a new vision to many new creators and cremated them
 apane udghaatan vaktavy main nandakishor acharya ne kaha ki nemichandra jain ne parampara ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekha he or nae satya kaa udghaatan kiya he
 He was always on the lookout for a novelty that brings a sense of morality in humans
 ve ek tareeke se nisang aalochak the
 Hindi criticism has not paid proper attention to his literary thinking and practical criticism
 or ye unki pratibha kii andekhi he
 More work needs to be done about his poems
 vishisht atithi ke rup main padhari rashmi vaajapeyi ne unke puure jivan ko yaad karte hue unki udaartaa ke kai udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki ve ek pati or ek pita ke rup main striyon kii swatantraaa ke prabal pakshdhar the
 After marriage, he not only educated his wife but also allowed him to work in various art mediums
 aisa hi unhone ham bahanon ke liye bhi kiya
 Referring to the special interest among the youth, he said that they wanted to spread the cultural understanding to the coming generations
 beej vaktavy dete hue prakhyat aalochak jyotish joshi ne kaha ki nemichandra jain sabhi arthon main virale vyakti the
 His work in all areas of Hindi literature will be memorable
 joshi ji ne kavita ko unke vyaktitv kii kunjee bataate hue kaha ki isi ke sahare ham unako behatar tareeke se samaj sakate hai
 It is necessary to properly analyze their operations
 ek aalochak ke rup main ve ‘sabhyataa sameekshak’ hai jo samskruti kaa koi bhi pahalu anchhua nahin chhodte hai
 He wanted to make Indian theater work centric, which is primarily director-centered
 unhone hindi aalochakon par talkh tippanee karte hue kaha ki unhone nemichandra jain ke saath behad sankeernata dikhaai he
 He further said that the poem of Nemichandra Jain needs to be watched with caution
 unhone kahani, upanyaas kii samiksha ke pratimanikaran kaa bada kaam kiya tha
 It is very important to explain their actions
 apane adhyakshiya vaktavy main madhav kowshik ne kaha saahitiyik sankeernata ke chalate hamane nemichandra kaa moolyankan uchit tareeke se nahin kiya he jisaki aaj behad zarurat he
 The first session which was on Natyalochan and Culture discourse was chaired by Devendraraj Ankur and Hrishikesh Sulabh, Kirti Jain and Suman Kumar presented their articles
 sarvapratham kirti jain ne nemichandra jain kii natya aalochana ke sandarbh main kaha ki hindi rangamanch ke vikaas main ve hindi pradesh kii samantvaadi soch ko zimmedaar tehraate the
 He believed that theater is not a classical genre in which changes cannot be made
 rangamanch ko nirantar apane darshakon ke saath samvaad karte rahanaa chahie
 Nemichandra Jain was expecting theatrical critics to pay serious attention to the essential and non-essential elements of the play
 hrishikesh sulabh ne kaha ki ve saanskrithik vimarsh kaa raajnneeti se prerit ho jane par chintit the
 He believed that plays are not just design but a mixture of all arts
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki nemichandra jain ne hi natya aalochana kii sahaj bhashaa ko taiyaar kiya
 He wanted to increase the intellectual capacity of Hindi theater
 suman kumaar ne kaha ki nemichandra jain ne yuva rangakarmiyon ko vah vivek diya jisase ve naatakon kii vibhinn shaileyon ko dekh or parakh sake
 Devendraraj Ankur, president of the session, said that the situation of theatrical criticism is still very serious and we still have not developed any overall vision to test it
 unhone ne kaha ki nemichandra jain hameshaa is baat par jor dete ki naatak kii samiksha main keval kisi ek paksh kii shreshthata kaa akalan nahin hona chahie, balki sabhi kshetron ko samyak drushti se dekhnaa chahie
 The next session focused on his poetry and poetry which was chaired by Nandkishore Acharya and Dhruv Shukla and Om Nischal presented their articles
 om nishchal ne nemichandra jain ke kavy-sansar ko chihnit karte hue kaha ki unka ekant ‘palaayanwadee ekant’ nahin tha balki usamen nij ke saath samaaj ko dekhne kii drushti thi
 The innerness of Nemichandra Jain is his vaishti
 nemichandra jain kaa kavi sankochi or kavy-sanyam kaa adbhut mishran he
 Dhruv Shukla said of his poem that his simplicity in poetry can be distinguished separately
 ve apane samakaleen kaviyon se prerana lete hue unke saath khadey dikhte he or sahchar or sahdharmee kii ek nai misaal prastut karte hai
 The chairman of the session, Nandkishore Acharya, considered Kavita his most beloved genre and said that he did the merger and socialization of Aham in poetry in a very balanced manner
 hamen unki kavita ko aitihaasik pariprekshya main samajhane kii zarurat he
 The final session was of Kathalochan and Interview which was chaired by Rohini Aggarwal and Satyadev Tripathi, Prabhat Ranjan and Pallava presented their articles
 pallav ne apane aalekh main kaha ki nemichandra jain apni pustak ‘adhure saakshaatkaar’ main aalochak kaa sachcha dharm nibhaate hue kabhi bhi kisi upanyaaskaar yaa upanyaas se abhibhoot nahin hote balki uski aalochana samgr rup se karte hai
 The formula of authenticity, subtlety and depth that he gives to test the novel is still classy today
 prabhaat ranjan ne kaha ki ve apni is pustak main aalochana ke aise sutara dete hai jo aane vaali peedi ko upanyaas padhane kii nai drushti dete hai
 Satyadev Tripathi said that his peculiarity of criticism is that he does not allow the critic of his play to come in the narrative review
 ve hameshaa kriti ke madhyam se samiksha karte hai or ‘mailaa anchal’ kii samiksha main yah udghaatit karte hai ki pehle hamaara samaaj aadhyamikta or dharmikata se sanchalit hota tha
 He is now being governed by politics
 rohinee agarwal ne apane adhyakshiya vaktavy main kaha ki vah apni aalochana main lekhak ko darkinar kar rachana se samvaad karte hai or uske tal main chhipi hui saadhaaran se saadhaaran chizon ko jaanch-parakhkar upar laate hai
 The program was moderated by Sahitya Akademi editor Anupam Tiwari
 kaarykram sthal par nemichandra jain ke vyaktitv or krititv ko pradarshit karti ek chitra-pradarshnee bhi lagaai gai thi

 6 maheene ke andar apane pad se ritair hone vaale justise jasti chelmeshwar supreme court main duusare number ke pramukh jaj hai
 It was he who led a group of 4 lawyers who appeared before the media against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra today
 iske saath hi unhone apni vakaalat ke kariyar main sabase badi matbhed ko abhootpurv tareeke se saamne rakhaa
 Together with Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Madan Lokur and Justice Kurian Joseph, he told the media that all is not well in the Supreme Court
 chelmeshwar ne kaha ki vah 20 saal baad yah nahin sunanaa chaahate hai ki in chaaron jajon ne apni aatma bech di thi
 Much that was not desired has happened in the last few months
 iske saath hi unhone chif justise mishra par kai aarope lagaae
 Along with this, he also made public the letter in which he said that the cases were not dealt to the best of their ability
 justise chelmeshwar sahit4 jajone letters main likhaa he ki yah jaruri siddhant he ki roster main keson ko unki merit ke hisaab se unhen sahi bench diya jaae, jo jaruri sadasyon or unki sankhya ke str par khare utre
 Four judges, including Justice Chelameswar, alleged that these rules were not followed in recent times
 kai mahatvapurn cese, jinka desh or supreme court par khud doorgaami prabhaav ho saktaa tha, vaise keson ko chif justise dwaara apane pasandida bechon ko diya gaya
 It did not adopt a rational approach
 haalanki yah pehla maamla nahin he jab justise jasti chelmeshwar ne apana matbhed jaahir kiya ho
 Even before this, in many cases, he has kept his different opinion from the rest
 bebaaki se rakhte hai batsupreme court ke vakil atul kumaar ne bataaya ki justise jasti chelmeshwar supreme court main apane vichaaron or faislon ko lekar kaaphi mukhar hai
 When PA Sangma filed a petition against Pranab Mukherjee becoming the President and was rejected by a bench headed by the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir, Justice Galasti Chelameswar was the judge to stand against that decision
 us faisle main 2 mukaable 3 jajon ke mat ne yachika ko khaarij karne main bhoomika nibhaai thi or tatkaalinchif justiseltamas kabir aakhri samay main faisla apane anusaar dene main safal rahe the
 Justice Ranjan Gogoi along with Justice Jasti Chelameswar were also against the verdict in this case
 faisle kaa virodh karte hue unhone mana tha ki raashtrapati pad ke liye nomination file karte samay pranab mukherjee ne laabh kaa pad barkaraar rakhaa tha
 The major case in which Justice Chelameswar showed his differences before the NJAC case was related to the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act
 samvidhan ke 99wein badlaav ke saath lagu hue rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog adhinium se rajanetaaon or civil socity ko supreme court or hai court main jajon kii niyukti ke maamle main power mil gaya tha
 The NJAC Act was repealed in 2015 by a five-member bench of the Supreme Court
 aapako bataa den ki sanvaidhanik bench ke us faisle main bhi sirf justise chelmeshwar ne act ko radd kiye jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 In writing the reverse judgment, he had upheld the act and stated that he believed the practice of collegium is completely opaque and that it is out of reach for both the general public and history, except in one or two cases
 supreme court ke vakil atul kumaar ne bataaya ki justise chelmeshwar ne colegium kii un baithkon main bhaag nahin liya, jab ties thakur chif justise hua karte the
 Justice Chelameswar signed those files only when he was sent to him by the Collegium
 MCI kesasenchhi cese main jajon par ghoose lene kaa aarope laga tha
 In this case also, Justice Chelameswar gave a different opinion from the other judges
 is cese main supreme court ke prashasnic maamalon ko lekar unhen chif justise ke saath thik aamane saamne paaya gaya
 Hearing on the petition in November last year, Justice Chelameswar ordered that a five-member constitutional bench be set up to consider whether the SIT was constituted in the case
 haalanki jab tak justise chelmeshwar is maamle main apana aadesh likh pate, unke teble par is cese ko duusare bench ke paas transfar karne kaa aadesh pahunch gaya
 The order came directly from Justice Deepak Mishrake
 justise chelmeshwar ne us draft order ko anulgnak karte hue likhaa ki sanvaidhanik bench banane kaa aadesh chif justise kii anupasthiti main bhi diya ja saktaa he
 Supreme Court lawyer Atul Kumar said that it was against the established rules of the Supreme Court
 chif justise mishra ne is maamle main justise chelmeshwar ke aadesh ko rivyuu karne ke liye ek alag 7 sadasyeey sanvaidhanik bench bana di
 Two judges were disqualified in this bench, while five judges, including Chief Justice Mishra, quashed the order of Justice Chelameswar
 khudcholegium kepeedit rahe hai justise jasti chelmeshwar?justise jasti chelmeshwar 20 oktober 2011 ko unhen supreme court kaa jaj banaaya gaya
 His decision to reach the Supreme Court is considered to be delayed, as he was the Chief Justice in the Gohati High Court from May 2007 to March 2010
 vahiin supreme court main jaj banane se pehle unhen kerala hai court kaa chif justise banaakar bheja gaya
 With this, the Supreme Court Collegium, which made Justice Jasti Chelameswar a judge of the Supreme Court, made Justice Deepak Mishra a judge of the Supreme Court
 haalanki mishra ko listing main varishthata de di gai, jis vah se justise jasti chelmeshwar ne chif justise banane kaa chance ganvaa diya
 While Justice Jasti Chelameswar will retire in June, Chief Justice Mishra will retire in October
 kanoonee cirkil main is baat kii charchaa rahi he ki justise jasti chelmeshwar colegium pratha ke peedit rahe hai
 For this reason, Justice Jasti Chelameswar is the biggest warrior who advocates transparency in this practice
 kai kaa maananaa he ki supreme court dwaara colegium ko lekar online jane ke faisle kii vajah bhi justise jasti chelmeshwar he, jinhone 23 saal puraane pratha kii khulkar aalochana kii he
 At the same time, in their letter to the Chief Justice, the four judges have opposed some names, which have been cleared to become the judges of the Supreme Court
 NJAC radd karne ke baad jajon kii niyukti ke liye supreme court memorondom of proscisger banane kii prakriya main he
 Who is Justice Justi Chelameswar Born in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, Justice Justi Chelameswar has been the Chief Justice of the High Court of Kerala and Guwahati

 After graduating in Physics, he obtained a law degree from Andhra University in 1976

 He spoke of a long debate on this rule

 Party General Secretary Ravi Shankar Prasad was made deputy leader in Rajya Sabha after SS Ahluwalia
 
 
 ek vyakti-ek pad siddhant ke aadhaar par unhone mahasachiv pad choda or gadakari kii team main unki jagah nae mahasachiv ke aane ke kayaas lagane lage
 
 
 After much digging, it was found that the new general secretary in Gadkari's team will be Amit Shah
 
 
 haalanki tab aisa nahin ho paaya
 
 
 In January 2013, Gadkari could not become president again
 
 
 rajnath singh ne party kii kaman sanbhali
 
 
 Amit Shah was made the General Secretary and given the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 isi ke saath tay ho gaya tha ki loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main narendra modi na sirf bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar honge, balki uttar pradesh se chunaav bhi ladenge
 
 
 It is not easy for the BJP to feed lotus on the barren land of Uttar Pradesh for 15 years
 
 
 khaastaur se aise vyakti ke liye to bilkul nahin, jisane kabhi gujarat ke baahar kaam na kiya ho
 
 
 Amit Shah has made his mark as a strategist in the last three assembly elections in Gujarat, and Shah has had a big role in the state from the selection of candidates to deciding the issues
 
 
 soharabuddin farji muthbhed maamle main supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik jab unhen gujarat se dur rahane ko kaha gaya to unhone uskaa istemaal dilli main rahakar modi ke liye jameen taiyaar karne main kiya
 
 
 Amit Shah is now engaged in Uttar Pradesh for the last 10 months
 
 
 aaj janamat surveykshanon main bhavishyavaanee kii ja rahi he ki loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bhaajapa uttar pradesh main kam se kam 40 siten jeet sakati he
 
 
 It is difficult to say whether this happens or not, but it is certain that after Amit Shah's move to Uttar Pradesh, a different kind of atmosphere has started to come in favor of Narendra Modi
 
 
 upi kaa prabharee banane ke baad amit shah ne rajya kaa daura shuru kiya
 
 
 He has gone to all 62 districts
 
 
 in dauron main shah ne kaaryakartaaon or netaaon se vyaktigat taur par milanaa shuru kiya
 
 
 Shah used to stay in the workers' houses instead of staying in a hotel or guesthouse at night
 
 
 is tarah unhone jamini str par samvaad kaayam kiya
 
 
 Raised teams of workers at booth level
 
 
 netaaon-kaaryakartaaon ko naseehat di ki narendra modi ke naam ko ghar-ghar tak pahunchaaen
 
 
 He kept saying that the Lok Sabha elections 2014 would be fought in the name of Narendra Modi

 As a result, every rally of Modi in Uttar Pradesh was bigger than the previous rally

 Local activists are not comfortable giving tickets to Jagdambika Pal from Dumriaganj from Congress, SP Singh Baghel from BSP from Firozabad and Dharmendra Kushwaha from Samajwadi Party from Amla
 
 
 bijanour main ain vakt par ummidavaar badalanaa padaa he
 
 
 Demonstrations have been held against candidates in many seats and many big leaders have turned their backs
 
 
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki tikat bantwaare main party adhyaksh rajnath singh ke aage amit shah kii nahin chal saki
 
 
 But Shah's close aides say that the distribution of tickets was deliberately delayed, so as not to provoke much dissatisfaction
 
 
 rajya main lambey samay baad bhaajapa ke paksh main maahaul bana he or kai netaa chaahate hai ki unhen chunaav ladane kaa mauka mili
 
 
 Amit Shah says that the SP-BSP declared their candidates many years ago, but they also change at the last moment
 
 
 bhaajapa or congress aisa nahin kar sakate, isliye tikaton main deree swaabhaavik he
 
 
 On the question of bringing candidates from outside, Amit Shah says that this number is not very high, and priority has been given to such people who are not disputed and can win their seats
 
 
 narendra modi ko banaras (varanasi) se chunaav maidan main utaarna amit shah kaa sabase bada daanv he
 
 
 The BJP, battered in Purvanchal, is likely to get new life from it
 
 
 ilaake kii 27 siton par bhaajapa kii nazren hai
 
 
 The party is trying to benefit from Modi's candidature from Bihar
 
 
 banaras se modi ko ladaana hindutv ke samarthakon ko sandesh dena bhi he
 
 
 Modi has not mentioned the Ram temple even once in his rallies
 
 
 amit shah jarur ayodhya gaye or vahaan ramamandir nirmaan kii baat kahi, lekin uske baad se unhone ek baar bhi ramamandir kii baat nahin kii
 
 
 Uttar Pradesh is very important personally for Narendra Modi
 
 
 vah jaanate hai ki pradhanmantri banane kaa unka sapana tabhi puraa ho saktaa he, jab loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main party ko upi se '90 ke dashak jaisi kamyaabi mili
 
 
 That is why he has given the responsibility of the state to his very close Amit Shah
 
 
 agar yahaan kamyaabi milti he to shah bhavishya ke liye party main badi jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke liye apni jagah pakki kar lenge

 We are satisfied with the favor of Additional Advocate General Sanjay Jain, who appeared for the government's side in this matter, that the government is not leaving any shortcoming in its efforts regarding Kulbhushan Jadhav
 court ne kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav kii rihaai ko lekar centre sarkaar apni visheshgyata or anubhav ke saath kadam uthaae
 What the court said: The court said that we feel that this petition has been made to get media attention and such petitions need not be supported
 jadhav kii rihaai or international court of justisake saamne jadhav kaa maamla rakhane kii maang vaali yachika par court ne sunwaayee se saaf-saaf inkaar kar diya or kaha ki sarkaar kaa kaam apane nagarikon kii suraksha karnaa he
 We hope that the government is doing the same in this matter
 ham ise sarkaar kii visheshgyata par chhodte hai
 Earlier in the hearing, the Central Government told the High Court that the Government had already said in the Parliament that whatever better efforts may be made to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav to India
 is maamle me sarkaar hi nahin balki puraa desh ekamat he
 The petitioner said that this case is related to Jadhav's kidnapping
 dilli hai court ne yachikakartako kaha ki jo prere aap court me lekar aae hai kya aap wo sarkaar ke paas lekar gaye or agar nahin gaye to kyon nahin gaye
 You are filing a PIL, do you know how many cases like Jadhav which are related to kidnapping
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki hamane sarkaar ko ek artiai lagaai thi
 In which we got a reply from the Government of India that no protocol is followed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in such cases
 court ne is baat par bhi naaraazgi jataai ki is tarah ke samvedansheel maamalon main jab tak court me sunwaayee nahin hui, tab tak aap ise media ko kaise de sakate hai

 Arvind Kejriwal, an important member of Team Anna, hurt by Baba Ramdev's advice, left the hunger strike
 kejariwal ne apane bhaashan main kai saansadon ke naam liye, jisapar baba ramdev ne aapatti jataai
 He said that his intention was to attack the government without naming anyone because taking names creates controversy
 jantar-mantar par hajaaron kii bheed ko sambodhit karte hue baba ramdev ne doharaaya ki sarkaar videshi bainkon main jamaa paisa waapas desh laae
 Attacking the Prime Minister directly, he said that he may be honest personally, but he should also ensure the honesty of his cabinet
 unhone kaha ki vah nau agast ko phir dilli aaenge or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf vyapak andolan kaa sutarapaatr karenge
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress criticized the joint fast
 sapa ke shahid siddiki ne kaha ki unke saath aane se koi parinaam saamne nahin aayega, jabaki congress ne kaha ki is tarah baar-baar loktantric sansthaaon par hamalaa raashtra ke liye acha nahin he
 Attacking Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Baba Ramdev said, "the Prime Minister says 'I am honest', but the country does not see you as a person
" " unhone kaha, "desh vyaktigat rup se aapke eemaandaar hone kaa sammaan karata he, lekin aapako raajnneetik rup se bhi eemaandaar hona chahie
 The country sees you as the highest constitutional post
 aapaki vyaktigat eemaandaaree kaaphi nahin he
 
 apane mantrimandal ko bhi eemaandaar rakhen
 " iske baad kejariwal ne rajanetaaon par hamalaa tej karte hue apane sambodhan main kaha ki lokapal vidheyak tab tak paarit nahin ho saktaa, jab tak ki sansad main lalu prasad, mulaayam singh yadav, e
 mps like Raja and Suresh Kalmadi are present
 unhone pradhanmantri par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki varsh 2006 se 2009 ke bich jab unke paas koyala mantralay kaa prabhaar tha, koyala blokon kaa aavanton undervier banane waalon, casette banane waalon or gutka banane waalon ko kiya gaya
 Soon after concluding Kejriwal's speech, Baba Ramdev objected to this and said, "today we thought we would not name anyone but Arvind Bhai took the name in the flow
 isse anaavashyak vivaad paidaa hoga
 " apane bhaashan par saarvajanik rup se aapatti jataae jane ke turant baad kejariwal anshan sthal se chale gaye
 However, he later wrote on the microblogging site that he left because he was not feeling well
 is bich, sapa netaa shahid siddiki ne kaha ki anna hajaare or ramdev isliye ek-duusare ke saath aae, kyonki unhen ek-duusare ke samarthan kii aavashyaktaa thi, lekin unke saath aane kaa koi parinaam saamne nahin aayega
 At the same time, Congress also criticized Anna Hazare and Baba Ramdev's fast
 kendriya krishi rajya mantri harish ravat ne kaha ki bhrashtachar se ladane ke naam par kaaryakarta loktantric sansthaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 He said, "they want to destroy all institutions in the name of fighting against corruption
" yah sweekaarya nahin hoga
 " anshan shuru karne se pehle baba ramdev va anna hajaare mahatma gandhi ke samadhi sthal rajghat gaye
 The two sat silently there and then went to Shaheed Park
 iske baad donon apane samarthakon ke saath subah kareeb 10 baje jantar-mantar pahunche

 Kejriwal named several mps in his speech, to which Baba Ramdev objected
 unhone kaha ki unka iraadaa kisi kaa naam liye bina sarkaar par prahaar karnaa tha kyonki naam lene se vivaad utpann ho jaataa he
 Addressing the crowd of thousands at Jantar Mantar, Baba Ramdev reiterated that the government should bring back the money deposited in foreign banks
 unhone pradhanmantri par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki vah vyaktigat rup se bhale hi eemaandaar hon, lekin apane mantrimandal kii eemaandaaree bhi vah sunishchit karen
 He said that he will come to Delhi again on August 9 and will initiate a mass movement against corruption
 vahiin, samaajawaadee party (sapa) or congress ne sanyukt anshan kii aalochana kii
 sp's Shahid Siddiqui said that coming with him would not yield any result, while the Congress said that repeated attacks on democratic institutions in this way is not good for the nation
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh par hamalaa karte hue baba ramdev ne kaha, "pradhanmantri kehete hai ki 'main eemaandaar hum', lekin desh aapako ek vyakti ke rup main nahin dekhtaa
 "he said," The country respects you to be honest personally, but you must also be politically honest
 desh aapako sabase oonche sanvaidhanik pad par asin vyakti ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Your personal honesty is not enough
 
 Keep your cabinet honest too
 " After this, Kejriwal intensified the attack on the politicians and said in his address that the Lokpal Bill cannot be passed unless Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, a in the Parliament
 raja or suresh kalmadi jaise saansad maujuud hai
 Attacking the Prime Minister directly, he said that between 2006 and 2009 when he had charge of the Ministry of Coal, coal blocks were allocated to underwear makers, cassette makers and gutka makers
 kejariwal ke bhaashan samaapt karne ke turant baad baba ramdev ne is par aapatti jataai or kaha, "aaj hamane sochaa tha ki ham kisi kaa naam nahin lenge lekin arvind bhai ne pravaah main naam le hi liya
 This will cause unnecessary controversy

 HD Kumaraswamy's government's departure in Karnataka is almost certain
 rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne lagaataar duusare din rajya sarkaar ko vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 Meanwhile, in a letter to the Chief Minister, the Governor has said that your government has lost majority
 aap sirf floor test taalane ke liye lambii bahes ko anjaam de rahe hai
 Significantly, the Governor has given an ultimatum to the Kumaraswamy government till 6 pm on Friday
 mukhyamantri kumaraswami ko likhi gai chitthee main rajyapal ne likhaa he ki main pehle hi kah chukaa hum ki aapke paas bahumat nahin he or aap floor test taalane ke liye bahes ko badha rahe hai
 i am constantly getting reports that the mlas are being bought and sold
 aise main meri aapse maang he ki aap jald se jald vidhansabha main apni sarkaar kaa bahumat sabit karen

 30 baje tak vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne kaa aadesh diya tha

 He said that another love letter has come to me from the Governor, in which he is accusing our government of buying and selling mlas
 kumaraswami ne bataaya ki ab rajyapal kah rahe hai ki horse trading ho rahi he jo vidhansabha ke liye thik nahin he
 It is worth noting that if the 16 rebel mlas are not part of the floor test to be held in the Vidhan Sabha, then Kumaraswamy's government will come in a minority
 aisi sthiti main congress-jedies ke paas 100 or bhartiya janata party ke paas 105 vidhayakon kii sankhya hogi
 BJP is also blaming the jds-congress
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki sarkaar bahes ko jaanboojh kar badha rahi he
 On the other hand, it has also been said by Siddaramaiah that as many as 20 people have left speaking speakers in the assembly on their behalf, so the floor test will be done only after the debate is over
 yani floor test somvaar ke liye taala ja saktaa he
 The Congress and Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy have again reached the Supreme Court against the Governor's order

 Some brothers say that the house is dilapidated, and the government is not paying any heed to it, so we will break it down and make Katra below and will keep the masters' heritage in a new hall above
 lekin duusari ore kuch bhai is faisle ke khilaaf hai, or ve makaan ko mul avasthaa main hi rakhana chaahate hai
 His elder son Haji Mahtab Hussain, who lives in the old house in Haraha Sarai Mohalla, Varanasi, Ustad Bismillah Khan, says, "ustad's shehnai went missing in 2009
 
 
 kahaan gai, kahaan he, pataa nahin
 
 
 We have not informed the police, as it is a family matter, but now we are finding out

 The Shiv Sena has reacted sharply to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement about Hindus in Chicago
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main party pramukh uddhav thakare ne sangh pramukh ke is bayaan par sawaal uthaaya he ki hinduon main varchasv banane kii koi mahatvakanksha nahin he, aakraamakata nahin he
 Bhagwat had said in Neshikago that Hindus as a society should come together and try for the welfare of mankind
 hinduon par aropashivsena pramukh uddhav thakare ne 'saamana' ke sampadakeey membhagwatke bayaan par likhaa- 'ye hinduon par lagaaya gaya aarope he
 Hindus should be aggressive, what do we mean? And if the aggressor Hindus are being crushed under the legal tank under their rule, then what is the churan for the Sangh? Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj established Hindavi Swarajya because Hindus had ambition to dominate
 ''bajirao peshwa nehindutvaka pataakaa afghanistan, pakistan se bhi aage laharaaya tha
 From Tatya Tope and Mangal Pandey to Veer Savarkar, many people fought the British for Hindu supremacy
 hindu aakraamak nahin hota to ayodhya kaa babari kaa kalank poncha nahin gaya hota or ye sab-kuch karne ke peeche shivasena kaa aakraamak hindutv hi tha
 "if the Shiv Sena had not had an aggressive Hindutva during the Mumbai riots of 1992-93, would all the Hindus here have had such a terrible situation?" Where were all these Hindu Hindu Congressmen hiding at that time? ”what did the Hindus in power do? In an editorial, Uddhav Thackeray also commented on the Hindutva agenda of the BJP
 saath hi bijepi ke shivasena ko lekar ravaiye par bhi naaraazgi dikhaai
 The editorial reads - 'vaishno Devi and Amarnath Yatra' ended smoothly without the 'roaring' of Shiv Sena chief in Mumbai and the green lungis of the terrorists were yellow, but what did they do as Hindus, what did they do? " Modi was aggressive and united, so Modi became the Prime Minister
 us ekajutata or aakraamakata kaa kya fal mila? shivasena se judaav todakar hindutv kii peeth main khanjar bhonkkar dekha or jo-jo aakraamak hindutv kii, rashtrahit kii hunkaar bhar rahe the, unhen bijepi dushman tehraane lagi
 "hindutva is coming to power with the help of the ladder and throwing the ladder as soon as it is done, such Hindutva continues these days
 ab satta main baithe dikhaawati hindutvvaadiyon kii mahatvakanksha hindutv kii aakraamakata kii aawaaj ko band karnaa he, hinduon ko unke hi hindusthan main aatankwaadi tehraakar khatm karne kii he
 At the Hindu Congress in Chicago, Bhagwat would have said something better on these subjects
 'hinduon kaa istemaal kar rahi bijepiudhav thakare ne sawaal kiya ki chicago main hue vaishvik hindu sammelan main shivasena yaa hindutv kaa jhanda lekar aage jane kisi or bhi dal ko nyotaa kyon nahin diya gaya
 The editorial reads that the way the Congress used Muslims, the BJP is using Hindus in the same way
 aisi bhaavana badhane lagi he or aisa uddhav thakare ko lagata he
 At the end of the editorial, Uddhav writes- 'leave the blessings of Hindus in the current' Hindutva 'rule, they are being made' secular '
 congress se congress kii ore, desh kii aisi yatra shuru ho chuki he
 ' congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne bhopal main kaha ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or pratibandhit sanghathan students islamic movement aaf india (simi) main koi antar nahin he or in sanghathanon se jude logon ke liye bhartiya yuva congress main bhi koi sthaan nahin he
 Reacting sharply to Rahul's statement, union spokesperson Ramadhav said that Rahul did not know the difference between a banned organization and a nationalist organization
 unhen italy or columbia se pehle bharat ko samajhnaa chahie
 Rahul Gandhi told reporters in Bhopal on the last day of his three-day visit in view of the Youth Congress elections that he considered both the Sangh and SIMI alike because of radical ideology

 Nimrat Chandani, a student of BDS final, was found dead in hostel on September 16, student is telling this case, police is telling the case, the mysterious death of Hindu student Nimrita Chandani of BDS final was found dead on September 16 in the hostel of Medical College in Larkana, Pakistan
 Has shaken up nimrata kii maut ko aatmahatya bataane kii koshish kii ja rahi he, lekin sachai isse pare najar aa rahi he
 Vishal Sundar, brother of Nimrata, who works as a physician in a hospital in Karachi, told local journalists on the day of the incident that his sister could not commit suicide under any circumstances as her family could not see any reason behind it
 vahiin, pakistan kii police is maamle kii lipapoti karti najar aa rahi he or vah lagaataar nimrata kii maut to aatmahatya kaa naam de rahi he
 The truth, however, seems to be the opposite as it is almost impossible to digest Nimrita's social media profile studying at the BB Asifa Dental College of Shaheed Mohatrama Benazir Bhutto Medical University, that a vivacious girl belonging to a highly affluent and educated family is good How can one commit suicide
 FB par 14 sitambar ko badla tha profile photonimrata kaa shav hostel ke unke kamare main fande se lataka hua paaya gaya tha
 On 14 September, Nimrita updated her profile photo on her Facebook page and in this picture she is smiling standing in a park in pink sareej and white salwar
 unki is tasviir par unke doctor bhai vishaal sundar or unki patni samitha vishaal sundar ne khub pyaar lutaaya he
 Earlier on 25 February, Nimrata posted a video congratulating her on her brother's wedding anniversary

 Nimrat had posted another post on September 2018, in which she is seen having fun in Karachi with her brother and sister-in-law
 is post main nimrata ne likhaa tha 'papa (jaipal chandani) ve aar missing you
 Earlier, on 17 June 2018, Nimrata posted another post, in which she is smiling standing in a restaurant with her father and uncle Pawan Chandani
 berthde par kiya tha ahm postanimrata ke fasebuk wal par sabase ahm post 7 june 2018 kaa he, jisamen unhone apane jivan main parivaar ke mahatv ko bayaan kiya tha
 She writes that the family makes them complete and they have no existence without the family
 is post main nimrata ne apane parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ko ek-ek karke yaad kiya or apane jivan main sabake mahatv ko bayaan kiya tha
 This post was probably done by Nimrita on her birthday and she was missing everyone while staying away from the family in the hostel
 yahi kaaran he ki is post main nimrata ne apane chachere bhai or bahanon ko bhi yaad kiya he or likhaa he ki in sabaki badaulat hi vah life main itani sari masti kar paati hai

 BJP leader Varun Gandhi may have thrown his foot in the poison against the Muslim community in Pilibhit, but the Shiv Sena has stood with him
 shivasena pramukh bal thakare kaa kahana he ki varun ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha or jo bhi kaha he sach kaha he
 In the party mouthpiece Saamana, Bal Thackeray has praised Varun Gandhi fiercely and said that at such a time, BJP should stand with him
 yahi nahin thakare ko varun main unke pita sanjay gandhi kaa aks najar aa rahaa he
 On the same excuse, he also pulled up the Congress for minority appeasement
 thakare ne likhaa he ki varun ke man main jo aag bhadki he use bujhane mat dijie
 Varun has told the truth
 aachaar samhita ke naam par ham par zyaadati kii ja rahi he
 Speak carefully, write carefully, do everything carefully
 ye sabak sirf hamen kyon sikhaaya jaataa he
 Further, he also says that after seeing Varun, we feel that Sanjay Gandhi has taken birth again
 aaj agar ve zindaa hote to congress alpsankhyakon kaa is kadar tushtikaran nahin karti
 Sanjay also spoke of Hindu interests
 aaj sanjay kaa koon varun kii raghon main ufaan maar rahaa he
 In this case, while writing to the BJP, he writes that what Varun said in Pilibhit's meeting is not the 'poison' but the anger of the majority
 varun ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha
 Varun is a young face of the BJP
 party ko unke saath khadaa hona chahie
 Thackeray writes that we do not think Varun needs any apology
 bhaajapa ko uske peeche khadaa hona chahie
 We have fallen in love with Varun and are blessing him

 The railway of Suresh Prabhu, dreaming of a bullet train, gives its rail passengers a blanket of un-washed blankets for months
 kaig ne train main milane vaale kambal kii saaf safai ke bare main jari kii gai apni report main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he
 According to this report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), washing of the blankets once in two months, blanket washing is done in many places in the railways at intervals of 6 to 26 months
 gauratlab he ki railway board ke nirdeshon ke mutabik, har 2 maheene main kam se kam ek baar kambal kii dry clining kii jaani jaruri he
 Audit studied data on the number of blankets and number of washed blankets during the review period at 33 selected coaching depots
 yah adhyayan 2012-13 se 2015-16 ke dauraan istemaal kiye gaye kambalon par kiya gaya
 The CAG in its study found that no blanket dry washes were done in 14 selected coaching depots of 9 Zonal Railways
 iske atirikt paanch kshetreey railway ke 7 depo ko chhodkar kisi bhi chune gaye depo main linen kii safai nahin kii gai thi
 a specific clause was added to all washing contracts for dry cleaning of woolen garments from chloro ethylene powered dry cleaning machines in South Central Railway, exposing a huge breach of contracts
 iske baavjood uparokt theka praavdhaan ke ulanghan main oonee kambalon ko dhoyaa ja rahaa tha
 During the joint investigation in the three Zonal Railways North Central Railway, Central Railway and Western Railway, it was observed that the provisions for contracts for dry cleaning of blankets were given each month, but this was not done monthly
 isi prakaar dakshin purv railway main 1 maheene main do baar dhulaai kaa praavdhaan tha, parantu aisa nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 Cleaning of blankets at intervals of 6 to 26 months No provisions were made for blanket cleaning and use of disinfectants
 lekhapariksha ne paaya kii 35 koching depo main se kambalon kii safai kaa praavdhaan paanch kshetreey railway ke keval 6 depo ke liye thekon main maujuud the
 However, there was no provision in contracts for two depots of Northern Railway
 kambalon ko hot air tareeke se 30 din or 15 din ke antaraal par saaf kiya jaataa tha, lekin kambal kii bhaap se safai yaa rasayan se safai nahin kii jaati thi
 The CAG in its investigation found that in relation to 12 coaching depots of 8 Zonal Railways during 2015-16, it can be said with certainty that the blanket was washed here after a gap of 6 to 26 months
 takiye to dhule hi nahin!yah to hui kambal kii baat ab baat karte hai railway main milane vaale takie kii dhulaai or safai kii
 In March 2016, the Railway Board directed that washing of pillows should be done at least once every 6 months or even earlier if needed so that every passenger can be provided with clean pillows
 march 2016 se pehle takiye kii dhulaai ke sambandh main koi nirdesh nahin die gaye the
 Despite this, those pillows where the washable pillows were to be washed
 lekin kaig ne yah paaya ki nirdeshon ke abhaav main samiksha kii avadhi ke dauraan do kshetreey railway ko chhodkar kisi bhi duusare kshetreey railway main takie nahin dhoe gaye
 In this way, the CAG in its investigation found that blankets and pillows were neither dryly cleaned nor cleaned before coming to the railway for supply to passengers

 At this stage, where there is a challenge for the BJP to save its fort, then it is a challenge for the Congress to regain its lost base
 in sabake bich congress or bijepi ke kai diggaj netaaon kii saakh daanv par lagi hui he, jo apni-apni jeet ke liye jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 Lohardaga (ST): The most interesting contest between the incumbent and former president of the Congress is in the first phase of the Lohardaga seat
 yahaan congress ke maujuuda or purv pradesh adhyaksh ke bich siyaasi sangram he
 Rameshwar from Congress is in Oraon Maidan, while Sukhdev Bhagat, former Congress president, has switched sides to BJP
 ajasu se niru shanti bhagat kismat aajamaa rahi hai, jo ki party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh camel kishor bhagat kii patni hai
 Interestingly, both the Congress and BJP candidates have been candidates for the Lohardaga seat
 is tarah se yah seat do raajnneetik dalon se zyada do naukarshah ke bich bhi maani ja rahi he
 In 2014, this seat was won by Kamal Kishore Bhagat of AJSU, but due to his conviction, Sukhdev Bhagat of Congress managed to win this seat
 is baar unhone paala badalakar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 In such a situation, it is to see who wins this high profile seat
 LIVE: jharkhand main jari he pehle charan kaa matdaan, padhein apadetabhavnathpur: chehre vahi, party naibhavnathpur vidhansabha seat par do paramparaagat pratidwandi bhanu pratap shahi or anant pratap dev ke bich kadaa muqabla he
 However, both the candidates are contesting from the new party ticket
 bijepi se purv swasthya mantri bhanu pratap shahi taal thok rahe hai to algepi se anant pratap dev maidan main hai
 Whereas, KP Yadav is trying his luck from Congress
 bhanupratap shahi jharkhand ke bahubali maane jate hai or yah unki raajnneetik tuuti bolti he
 In 2014, Bhanu Pratap Shahi won the election as an AJSM candidate, but later joined the BJP
 aise main party ne un par daanv khelaa he
 Vishrampur: In the contest, the contest is between the two old veterans in the minister's seat at Vrishrampur
 bijepi se diggaj netaa or gramin vikaas mantri ramchandra chandravanshi maidan main he to congress se chandrashekhar dube kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Whereas, Anju Singh from JVM is in the fray
 2014 main bijepi ke ramchandra chandravanshi jitkar mantri bane the
 His name comes among the strong leaders of Raghuvar Das government, due to which this seat is considered very high profile
 latehar (essi) :aamane-saamne do yoddhalatehar vidhansabha seat anusuchit jati ke arakshit hai, lekin is seat par donon puraane chunavi yoddha hi aamane-saamne hai
 However, both of them have changed the party this time and entered the electoral arena
 bijepi se prakaash ram chunavi taal thok rahe hai
