 vahi hui jiskaa dar tha, ho gaya salmaan-ulia kaa brallep! ab bharat kii sabase badi chintaaon- garibi, berozegaar or jammu-kashmir masale ke alaava 'salmaan khan' kii shaadi dobaaraa shaamil ho gai hai
 The Salman Khan, on whom millions of girls spend their lives, remains the only virgin, how can this be so? This question is bothering everyone
 javaani ke 51wein vasant main kadam rakh chuke sallu kii shaadi unke phens ke bich vaaki ek 'rashtriya chintaa' kaa vishay ban chuki he
 This is the reason why once upon a time, Salman had also publicly announced his wedding date during an interview
 unhone kaha tha ki wo 18 navambar ko shaadi karenge
 But there was no confirmation on which year it will be
 padhen: salmaan ko phir nahin mila prem ratan dhan, ulia se bhi brikepagauratlab he ki yahi wo mukammal taarikh he jis din unke mata-pita kii shaadi hui thi or unki bahan arpita khan kii bhi
 Tosalaman also wants to marry on this date
 lekin pataa nahin koun se saal main aisa hoga
 The media has already started 'research' on the reasons for their not being married, mainly in which five reasons have been revealed
 
 
 1
 Salman's large family: Salman's family consists of people of different religion and caste, including mother, father, brother, sister and sisters-in-law
 vaaki yah family sahi myanon main ek True Indian family he
 Apart from this, his family and his family are also engaged in charity works
 ab bhala aisi ladki milanaa bhi to mushkil he jo na sirf ghar ke sabhi sadasyon kaa dhyaan rakhe or unki seva kare balki saath hi saath charity main bhi haath bantaye
 Perhaps this is the reason why Sallu Mian's list of female fans and girlfriends is very long, but when it comes to marriage, everyone will cut their own
 padhen: bhaijan ke man main phir se jaagane laga katrina ke liye 'fitur'2
 Salman's craze: Salmanke's attitude, angry temper and attitude are like 'sweet on the cake' on his personality
 salmaan apni lifestil or chizon ko lekar bahut particular hai
 He likes everything well
 uske alaava 'bhai' ko na sirf gussa jaldi aata he, balki ek baar aayaa to tikta bhi kaaphi lambey samay tak he
 Now where will the girl with such endurance be found who can tolerate all Salman's tantrums? 3
 aij gap:isi saal disambar mensalmanpure 51 saal ke ho jaaenge
 Now at this age, usually girls in our country start worrying about their children's marriage
 ek sangeeta bijlani ko chhod diya jaae jo unke baraabar kii umr kii thi unki baaki garlfrends umr main salmaan se 10 se 20 saal tak choti rahi hai
 Now if someone marries a person of old age, then there must be maturity in it
 lekin salmaan tehre mammaj bvoy, papaaj bvoy, fimali bvoy
 
 
 Now who should play with them in this way? 4
 salmaan kii kundali:saptam bhav, vivaah bhav kaa swami brihaspati kaa pancham bhav yani pyaar bhav yaa kahe lav house se sambandh ban rahaa he sapthamesh brihaspati or panchmesh shukr kaa ek duusare ke saath purna ithshaal he aisi sthiti mensalmaan khankisi ke saath pyaar ke bandhan main bandha sakate he lekin pyaar shaadi tak pahunch jaae ye andeh he
 In Nawansh also both Jupiter and Venus are sitting together with Rahu in the eighth position, this situation tells the love and trouble in love
 kundali kii maane to pyaar kaa romance chalate rahegaa lekin abhi shaadi main deree tay he
 5
 salmaan ke court cese:salmaan par chale tamaam court keson kii vajah se ek lambey arase tak industry main unki image par 'bed boy' kaa thappa laga rahaa
 Others like themselves did not want to bring a daughter-in-law to the house in such an atmosphere of tension
 unhone to yahi sochaa tha ki ek baar saare court cese nipat jaaen to phir sukh-shaanti se shaadi kaa sochenge taaki honeymoon ke samay court kii date ke liye bhagkar waapas aane kii jaldi na ho

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main dilli main congress or aam aadmi party (aap) ke gathbandhan ke kayaason par aap ke sanyojak or arvind kejariwal ne viraam laga diya he
 While addressing the press conference on Thursday, Kejriwal said that AAP candidates should be won in all the seven seats of Delhi
 isse saaf he ki dilli main aap akele chunavi maidan main utregi
 In fact, after the command of the Congress was given in the hands of Sheila Dixit in Delhi, it was believed that the Congress and AAP would enter the electoral fray
 lekin kejariwal ne saaf kar diya he ki narendra modi ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main haraana he to dilli kii sabhi siton par aap ummidavaaron ko jitakar sansad bhenje taaki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaayaa ja sake
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party has appointed its in-charge in five Lok Sabha seats in the state
 wo sabhi apane-apane sansadeey kshetron main lagaataar sakriy hai
 Atishi has been made the East Delhi seat, party spokesperson Dilip Pandey has been made in charge of North East Delhi, the party's national secretary Pankaj Gupta has been in charge of Chandni Chowk
 aap ke koshadhyaksh rahe yuva netaa raghav chaddha ko dakshini dilli jabaki kuch samay pehle bijepi se AAP main aae guggan singh ranga ko uttar-pashchim dilli loksabhaa kshetra kaa prabharee niyukt kiya tha
 But did not appoint in-charge on West Delhi seat on New Delhi seat
 ab jab kejariwal ne kah diya he ki wo saaton siton kii baat kii he to aise main baaki bachi do siton par bhi prabharee niyukt karne honge
 However, in the last Lok Sabha election, the Aam Aadmi Party had contested all the seven Lok Sabha seats, but did not win a single seat
 sabhi saaton siton par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Whereas in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, seven seats went to the Congress account
 bataa den ki dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ko rajya kii 70 siton main se 67 siton par jeet mili thi
 The remaining 3 seats were won by the BJP and the Congress could not even open an account

 In today's era, it is difficult to find honest people
 aise main koi eemaandaar mil jaae to kisi chamatkaar se kam na samajhie
 One such honest honesty is caught in the CCTV in Hira Nagari Surat
 gujarat kii hira nagari kahe jane surat shahar ke mahidharpura hira bazaar main ek hira vyavsaayee kii jeb se gire 25 lakh ke heere ek thele vaale ko mili to usne eemaandaaree se hira vyavsaayee ko lautaa die
 Kahira Bazaar in Mahidharpura area of surat, diamonds worth crores of rupees are traded everyday
 isi hira bazaar main kuch hira kaarobaari footpath par baithkar apana kaarobaar karte he to kuch kaarobaari offison ke bheetar se apana kaarobaar chalaate hai
 In Surat's Mahidharpura diamond market, a person named Badrinarayan also does business of hero transactions
 23 agast kii raat kariban 8 baje hira bazaar main sthit ek dukaan ke baahar badrinarayan apni shart main kuch nikaalane ke haath daalata he to usee ke saath isaki jeb main rakhaa heere kaa packet neeche gir jaataa he
 But the diamond merchant Badrinarayan does not even know about it and goes away
 vyapaarike jeb se gire is heere ke packet par aasapaas ke logon kii bhi najar nahin padati
 But if a packet is standing there, then it does not directly pick it up
 vyapaaree ko nahin mila packetahire kaa packet uthaane se pehle wo dukaan ke bheetar jaataa he or phir kuch der baad baahar nikalakar is heere ke packet par pair rakhkar khadaa ho jaataa he or idhar-udhar dekhne ke baad dhire se neeche jhukta he or jameen par gire is heere ke packet ko uthaakar apane paas rakh letaa he or phir vahaan se chalaa jaataa he
 When the diamond merchant went to search for the diamond packet again at the same place, he could not find anything at that place
 heere kaa packet na milane par hira vyavsaayee ne baad main police kaa sampark kiya tha
 When the CCTV footage of Hirenzeek returned from him was traced, the entire matter was arrested from the pocket of the diamond to the merchant till the cart was taken away
 duusare din jab phir usee jagah par hira vyapaaree police ke saath pahunchataa he or aas-paas ke logon se poochta he to thele vaala saamne se bataa detaa he ki heere kaa packet uske paas he or wo heere kaa packet police kii hajiri main dinesh ne eemaandaaree se hira vyapaaree ko saunp de detaa he
 Badrinarayan Soni, who lost the diamond, also thanked him for seeing the honesty of the handler

 piem modi ne shuukravaar ko sadan main laae gaye avishvaas prastaav par bolte hue piem modi ne kaha ki desh ke kone-kone ko modi par vishwaas he, lekin kuch dalon ko vishwaas nahin he
 Modi said, 'we have repeatedly asked the reason for his mistrust, but he could not give reasons and was hugged
 'piem ne kaha ki ahankaar, dambh or daman ke sanskaar aaj kaa yuva bharat sahane ko taiyaar nahin he

 He said, 'A few days ago the sugarcane farmers came to meet me in Delhi and i told them that soon the sugarcane farmers will get to hear a good news and i have come to Shahjahanpur to fulfill the same promise

 There has never been a hike in the government price of 14 crops of rice, maize, pulses and oil from Rs 200 to Rs 1800

 PM Modi said that the sugarcane sown this time is Rs 155 per quintal
 lekin is baar jo mulya tay kiya gaya he wo paune do guna ho rahaa he
 The PM further said that even if the recovery of sugar is less per quintal, then the rate of Rs 261 will be more than before

 He said that just when the refinery people were telling me about it, i asked him to tell the date of inauguration
 piem bole ki ye samay sankalp se siddhi kaa samay he
 The refinery will be inaugurated before 2022
 PM modi ne is dauraan purv uparashtrapati bhairo singh shekhavat, bijepi netaa jasamvat singh kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that there was a tradition in our country to forget history
 unhone kaha ki isroyal ke piem in dinon bharat ke daure par hai, desh kii aazaadee ke baad main pehla piem tha jo isroyal gaya tha
 He said that when i went to Israel, i went to Haifa, then paid tribute to the Indian heroes who sacrificed to liberate Haifa in the First World War
 us dauraan sainikon kaa netritv rajasthan ke major dalpat singh ne kiya tha
 Teen Murti Chowk in Delhi is built in his memory, now it has been renamed as Teen Murti Haifa Chowk
 congress or akaal judwa bhipiem ne kaha ki pehle main sunata tha ki rajasthan main congress or akaal judwa bhai hai, jahaan congress jaaegi vahaan par akaal saath-saath jaataa he

 The Congress gave Rs 500 crore in the interim budget and kept cashing it throughout the election
 sirf bajet main kaha gaya tha lekin is par kaam shuru nahin kiya tha
 The Congress at OROP said in the siege PM rally that by giving only 500 crores, did the Congress really want to do good for the soldiers, the total expenditure in this was Rs 12000 crores
 maine phogiyon ko kaha ki sarkaar ke paas bajet kam he, isliye ek saath nahin de sakate hai
 The soldiers accepted my point and agreed to take pension in four pieces

 com / cvddhfj77o— PIB India (@pib_india)january 16, 2018is 43,000 karod rupee kii laagat vaali pariyojna ke chaar saal main puraa hone ke baad isse pratyaksh va apratyaksh taur par 10,000 logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 It is a joint venture of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and the Government of Rajasthan, with a refinery of 9 MMTPA (million metric tonnes per annum) capacity
 iske utpaada bies-viai utsarjan ke maanakon ke anuroop honge
 Addressing the rally, the Chief Minister of Warrajasthan on Vasundhara's Sonia said that the present day Rajasthan is historic
 unhone kaha ki is sapane ko hamaari pichhali sarkaar ne dekha tha, aaj bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan hi isaki shuruyaat ho rahi he
 The Congress did nothing for four years during its tenure, but at the time of the election, it was done by calling Sonia Gandhi in a hurry
 unhone kaha ki congress kii niyat is pariyojna ke liye sahi nahin thi
 Our government has worked on this plan in detail, not just about the populace
 congress ne kiya he viropcongress kaa aarope he ki is rifinary kaa shilanyas pehle hi tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kar chuki hai
 Then why PM is doing this
 is bich barmer rifinary ko lekar congress va rajasthan kii sattarudh bhaajapa ke bich raajnneetik bahes tej ho gai he
 Regarding the refinery, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had questioned the Prime Minister as to why the foundation stone of the refinery is being redone, when it has already been done in 2013
 iske turant baad vitarit kiye gaye aamantran patr main 'kaary shubharambh samaaroh' likhaa gaya he
 Gehlot said in a quick comment on this that this is a step like hiding the face of the Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia government
 dilachasp he itihaas2013 main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle gahalot sarkaar ne sonia gandhi ko bulaakar tel rifinary kaa shilanyas karavaaya tha
 Vasundhara Raje closed it after coming to power, calling it a loss deal
 ab 2018 main vidhansabha chunaav he to vasundhara raaje ne 16 janvari ko phir se shilanyas karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bulaayaa he
 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is citing his Hindu deeds on BJP on this matter, saying that it is not right to cancel the program of chanting at one place and worship at that place

 ahm baat majumdaar kii posting he
 This is being seen as two targets of the Delhi Government with one stone
 isse afasarshahi main ye sandesh diya ki sarkaar unke prati utani sakht nahin jitani bataayi ja rahi he yaa jaisaa maahaul ban rahaa he or doosraa uparajyapal ke aham ko bhi shant karne kii koshish kii he
 Anindo Majumdar is the only officer who appointed Shakuntala Gamlin as acting chief secretary on the orders of LG, while the Delhi government said that the appointment was made without her consent and the appointment of Anindo Majumdar was removed
 tippaniyan The LG then ordered the Delhi government to cancel the order and reinstate Majumdar, but the government refused to oblige and had locked Majumdar's office
 alji ne baad main phir aadesh diya lekin sarkaar ne kah diya ki alji ko adhikaar hi nahin aise aadesh dene kaa or jab vivaad lanbaa chalaa to grih mantralay notification le aayaa
 CM Kejriwal met LG on Tuesday and after that orders have come on Wednesday
 yani kul milakar afasaron kii naaraazgi or alji kii baat kaa kuch maan rakhane kii koshish ko halaat sudhaarney kii disha main kejariwal sarkaar kaa ye ek ahm kadam mana ja saktaa he
 The important thing is the posting of Majumdar
 ye dilli sarkaar kaa ek tir se do nishane ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 This gave the message in the bureaucracy that the government is not as strict towards them as it is being told or the atmosphere is building and another has tried to calm the ego of the Lieutenant Governor
 anindo majumdaar hi wo adhikari hai jinhone shakuntla gammlin ko alji ke aadesh par kaaryvahak mukhya sachiv niyukt kar diya jabaki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki ye niyukti bina uski sahmati ke hui or niyukti ke anindo majumdaar ko pad se hataa diya tha
 The comments iske baad alji ne dilli sarkaar kaa aadesh radd karne or majumdaar ko behaal karne kaa aadesh diya lekin sarkaar ne maanane se manaa kar diya or majumdaar ke daftar par taala jad diya tha
 LG later gave the order again but the government said that LG did not have the authority to give such orders and when the dispute went long, the Ministry of Home Affairs brought the notification
 mangalvaar ko siem kejariwal alji se mili or uske baad buudhvaar ko ye aadesh aaye hai
 That is, the resentment of the officers overall and the lg's attempt to have some value can be seen as an important step of the Kejriwal government in improving the situation

 modi se ummid nahin ki vah aam sahmati banane kii koshish bhi karenge, isliye raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke chunaav main ummidavaar utaaregaa vipaksh
 Earlier, Sonia and Rahul have separately met Sitaram Yechury, d Raja, Omar Abdullah, Nitish Kumar, Sharad Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Kutti of IUML
 sutron ke mutabik, party kaa ek khemaa maanata he ki, raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke naam par agar endie taiyaar ho jaye to aam sahmati ho jaaegi, kyonki pranab mukherjee ke kareebi sutron kaa maananaa he ki wo chunaav nahin ladenge, haa agar unke naam par sabhi sahamat hon to wo vichaar karenge
 Apart from this, the name of any non-political person is also being considered, on which everyone can agree
 sutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki, sharad yadav or sharad pavaar ke naam par bhi charchaa hui
 That is why Sonia met Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar separately
 haalanki, pavaar ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki, wo nahin ladanaa chaahate
 The opposition realizes that they are behind in the numbers game
 isliye ek vichaardhaara or ek hi vyakti yani modi kaa faisla thopane ke khilaaf sabko saath laane kii koshish kii ja rahi he, jisase bhavishya main mahagathbandhan banaaya ja sake
 With the principles of national interest, protection of Indian democracy standards, accountability and responsibility of the Constitution, the Congress is set to execute the Grand Alliance
 is bare main congress ke media prabharee randeep surejwaala ne yah sweekaar kiya ki sonia ji or rahul ji tamaam vipakshi netaaon se milakar raashtrapati or uparashtrapati chunaav ko lekar charchaa kar rahe hai

 Does Congress President Rahul Gandhi not know the courtesy of how to meet the people sitting in constitutional positions? There is a flood of misleading claims to demean politicians during the election season
 fasebuk par kuch log, ek tasviir ke jariye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 It is being claimed that Rahul Gandhi met Vice President Venkaiah Naidu in a rude manner
 tasviir main bhi aisa dikh rahaa he ki rahul gandhi safed dhoti pahane hue kisi varisht netaa se kuch ajeeb tareeke se haath mila rahe hai jinka cheharaa saaf nahin dikh rahaa he
 The India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this claim is misleading
 rahul gandhi jis netaa se mulaakaat kar rahe hai wo uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu nahin balki congress ke varisht netaa pi chidambaram hai
 a Facebook user named Pradeep Tamhankar posted the post with the picture that reads, "even after seeing Rahul Gandhi's rude behavior during his courtesy call on Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, the Congress would have dreamed of making Jahil a PM
 So damn "
 khabar ke likhe jane tak is post ko 450 se zyada log share kar chuke hai
 Reacting to this post, many people are expressing displeasure with Rahul Gandhi, but there are others who said that the claim being made in this post is false
 hemanth seetaram naam ke ek vyakti ne is post ke jawaab main likhaa ki jis vyakti se rahul gandhi mulaakaat kar rahe hai wo naidu nahin balki chidambaram hai
 When we searched this photo by reverse searching, we found this picture on the website of indiatimes which was printed on 6 December 2013 i

 Looking at the photo, one can be deceived because Rahul Gandhi can be seen clearly from the front, but p Chidambaram's photo is taken from the back, so his face is not visible
 dakshin bharat se hone kii vajah se pi chidambaram or vankaiya naidu donon hi aksar safed dhoti or shart pahante hai

 ab jabaki 21 march ko holi ke din akshay kumaar kii filmakesaria rahi he, kaaphi log saragadhi kii ladaai ke bare main jaanane ko utsuk ho gaye hai
 But less people will know that there is also a Saragadha Gurudwara in Amritsar, Punjab
 saragadhi gurudwara amritsar ke toun haal or swarnmandir ke paas hi bana he
 The gurudwara is so small that you hardly see it
 lekin is chote se gurudware se sikhon kii dilari kii amit kahani judi he
 This is the story of the battle of Saragarhi and the bravery of Sikh soldiers in it
 khaas baat yah he ki is gurudware ko san 1902 main khud angrejon ne apane 21 bahadur sikh sainikon kii yaad main banwaaya tha
 These soldiers sacrificed their lives to save the Saragarhi post
 kya thi saragadhi kii ladisaragadhi kii ladaai 12 sitambar, 1897 ko 36veen sikh regiment ke 21 sipaahiyon or 10,000 afgaan kabailiyon ke bich ladi gai thi
 Saragarhi was a British military post in the North West Frontier Province (present-day Pakistan) of India at that time
 afghanistan se lagane vaale ilaakon par kabja banaae rakhane ke liye angrej sena yahaan tainaat kii gai thi
 There were frequent battles between the Afghans and the British over the occupation in this area
 isi dauraan 12 sitambar, 1897 ke din afaridi or aurakazai kabeeley ke 10,000 se 12,000 afgaanon ne saragadhi post par hamalaa kiya
 The Saragarhi Post served as a signal to the surrounding forts
 saragadhi kile ko do kilon loclert or gulistaan ke bich main ek pahari par banaaya gaya tha
 a contingent of 20 soldiers was stationed with Havildar Ishar Singh for the protection of Saragarhi
 afgaanon kaa gheraa aisa tha ki paas ke kilon se madad bhi nahin bheji ja sakati thi
 It is said that after the Afghan attack, these soldiers were also asked to evacuate the post and retreat, but these soldiers, following the Sikh tradition, decided to fight the enemy till death
 ishar singh or unke sipaahiyon ne bahaduree se hamale kaa saamana kiya
 The 21 soldiers kept fighting the Afghanos who came in thousands throughout the day
 goli-barood khatm hone par unhone haathon or sangeenon se aamane-saamne kii ladai ladi
 Ultimately, the Afghans captured Saragarhi, but in this battle, the Afghans suffered a great loss of life
 is ladaai ke kaaran madad ke liye aa rahi angreji fouj ko samay mil gaya or agle din aae angrejon ke daste ne afgaanon ko haraakar phir se saragadhi par kabja kar liya
 After the British re-occupation, Sikh soldiers' wariness came to the fore
 angrej sainikon ko vahaan kareeb 1400 afgaanon kii laashen mili
 Gurmukh Singh, the last soldier left on Saragarhi, killed 20 Afghans while fighting inside the signal tower
 jab afgaan gurmukh par kaabo nahin paa sake to unhone tower main aag laga di or gurmukh jinda hi jal kar shahid ho gaye
 The bravery of Sikh soldiers was also discussed in the British Parliament
 yahaan shahid hue sabhi 21 bahadur sikh sainikon ko us samay bhartiya sainikon ko milane vaale sabase bade veerta puruskaar indian order of merit se sammanit kiya gaya
 Later, as a memorial to this battle, the British built three gurdwaras in Amritsar, Ferozepur and Waziristan
 is ladaai kii yaad main aaj bhi 12 sitambar ko saragadhi diwas manaaya jaataa he
 UNESCO has counted the battle of Saragarhi in 8 of the most heroically fought battles in the world till date

 press conference kii shuruyaat main ashutosh ne ginaae piem modi ke notebandi vaale bayaan-1

 But when PM did not say a word on the issue of Akhlaq, Najeeb, Rohit Vemula, we would have assumed that the BJP is a minority and anti-dalit
 lekin notebandi par hui samasya par kya piem naagarik virdohi ho gaye hai
 PM himself should decide at which crossroads he has to come
 notebandi ke 50 din puure hone par AAP ne piem modi se puche ye sawaal-1
 Why did the PM not say anything over 100 deaths? 2
 lakhon logon kii berogari kaa jimmedaar koun?3
 What did PM Modi think of farmers when their farming was ruined? 4
 agar ek bhi aatankwaadi ghatana hoti he to kya piem istipha dene kaa elaan karenge?5
 Who is responsible for the small business closed by demonetisation? 6

 vahiin nijee bainkon main pramukhon kii selary or sarkari bainkon main selary kaa antar samaj se pare he
 This becomes more important when the salary of the head of the central bank of the country, which is responsible for deciding monetary policy along with the treasury of the Government of India, is just a few lakhs more than the head of the State Bank

 When Team India captain Cool MS Dhoni suddenly announced his retirement from Test cricket, he was criticized by many veteran cricket pundits
 kuch ne kaha ki vanade or tii-20 cricket kii captaini se bhi unhen hataa diya janaa chahie
 But there is also no dearth of cricket pundits who are convinced of Dhoni's captaincy
 purv cricketer or camentator sanjay manjrekar ne dhoni ko duniya kaa best captain qaraar diya he or saath hi kaha ki wo aadhi team ke baraabar hai
 Now less than a month is left for the World Cup to begin and all the teams are busy in preparations
 sanjay kii maane to dhoni world cap main akele aadhi team ke baraabar honge
 Sanjay said that Dhoni is a master of amazing personality
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik manjrekar ne dhoni kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah anokhe khilaadi hai
 Manjrekar said, "dhoni has nothing to do with the history of cricket
 agar unase poocha jaae ki bharat ke pichley chaar yaa paanch captain koun hai to shaayad vah nahin bataa paaen
 But he is amazing as a player or as a captain
 ' sanjay ne kaha ki vastav main world cap main vah aadhi team india ke baraabar sabit honge
 When Sanjay was asked to compare the 1992 team that played the World Cup, he said that the current team will get better marks for fielding and running
 vartmaan khilaadi viketon ke bich behatar dhang se daudte hai
 The team at that time was never able to convert two runs into three and run-outs were common
 unhone majaak karte hue kaha ki main isamen aage tha
 He admitted that Team India has the potential to win the World Cup but would have to motivate the bowlers to score at least runs in the last over
 deth over bahut ahm hote hai
 Now our spinners owe it to how they bowl
 unhen middle overon main vicketen leni hongi
 Virender Sehwag's bat had forgotten to shoot and Sachin Tendulkar was not getting runs off the bat
 yah alam tha newlands maidan kaa jahaan duniya main number ek bharat behad rakshaatmak ravaiya apanaakar guuruuvaar ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf teesraa or antim test cricket match drow karwaane main safal rahaa
 India had a target of 340 runs to create new history by winning the series for the first time on South African soil, but their batsmen came to the ground thinking of a draw from the beginning and they scored 166 for three in 82 overs in the day
 It was considered appropriate to tie the series of matches 1–1
 gautam gambhir ne drow karwaane ke bhartiya abhiyaan kii aguwai kii
 He batted for almost four and a half hours, scoring 64 off 184 balls
 tendulkar ne dhai ghante main 91 gend par naabad 14 ran jabaki rahul dravid ne bhi itane hi samay main 112 gend par 31 ran banaaye
 Only VVS Laxman (32 not out) strike rate (47) among Indians
 76) behatar rahaa
 South Africa took the new ball after 80 overs but after only two overs both teams agreed to draw the match
 bharat is tarah se pehali baar dakshin africa main shrinkhalaa baraabar karaane main safal rahaa
 South Africa won the first Test match played at Centurion by an innings and 25 runs in which Tendulkar made history by scoring his 50th century
 bharat ne durban main lakshmana ke behtareen prayaas se doosraa test match 87 ran se jitkar shrinkhalaa baraabar karaayi thi
 Now the only Twenty20 between the two teams and then a series of five odis will be played
 alam yah tha ki apane visphotak tewaron ke liye mashhoor sahvaag lagbhag ek ghante par krij par bitaane or 40 gend khilne ke baavjood keval 11 ran bana paye
 Sehwag, who could not play any big innings in the series, was also given a life by JP Duminy, who was fielding in place of injured Jacques Kallis
 sahvaag iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye or morkal kii gend par pehali slip main captain greem smith ko kaich dekar pavilion laute
 Gambhir also appeared in a mood to repeat his feat against New Zealand in Wellington in 2009
 tab unhone lagbhag saadhe das ghante krij par bitaakar bharat kii haar taali thi
 He was stuck on 62 runs for 31 balls in the middle and he also got two lives
 apni rakshaatmak ballebaaji ke kaaran ‘bhartiya diwaar’ kaa visheshan paane vaale dravid to aisi paristhitiyon main khilne ke aadi hai or unhone bhi gambhir ke saath krij par samay bitaane ko hi tarjeeh di
 These two rarely played aggressive shots and kept on playing balls that went out of stumps
 pehali pari main 93 ran banane vaale gambhir ne del sten kii gend ko cat karke seemaa paar bhejkar apana ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Kallis, who scored a century in both innings for South Africa, could not get on the ground due to an injury in the rib and hence Smith played the fifth bowler in the middle
 haris kii kuch gendon ko raf aria se asmaan oochaal mili jisase ballebaajon ko thodi pareshaani bhi hui
 Harris made a leg-up appeal against Dravid but was turned down by umpire Ian Gould
 riple se lag rahaa tha ki tab gend middle stump par lag rahi thi
 Dravid (31), however, was dismissed by Lonwabo Tsotsobe shortly before tea to give South Africa the necessary breakthrough
 dravid ne short pich gend ko rakshaatmak rup se khilne kaa prayaas kiya lekin vah unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar teesri slip main eshwel prince ke haathon main chali gayi
 Gambhir AB de Villiers and Alviro Peterson also gave lives
 gambhir kii is sanghasharpurn pari kaa ant aakhir main sten ne kiya jinke leg said kii taraf ja rahe bounsar par balla adaane ke chakkar main unka globs lag gaya or wicket ke peeche bouchar ne use kaich main tabdeel kar diya
 Tendulkar also landed at the crease with the aim of setting foot like Angad
 bich main unhone 25 or phir 34 gend khelkar koi ran nahin banaaya
 However, Laxman put some good shots in the meantime, including two fours in one over of Sotsobe

 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf uttar pradesh main yatra par nikle aadhyatmik guru shrishri ravishankar ne kaha he ki desh main bhrashtachar lagaataar punap rahaa he or sirf aadhyatm se hi is buraai ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Addressing the gathering at the Khurshid Club ground, Ravi Shankar said, 'people say why spiritual gurus talk about mass corruption
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki aadhyatm se hi bhrashtachar samaapt hoga
 He said, "there is lack of affinity and spirituality in the country due to which corruption is flourishing
" ab main bhrashtachar ke viruddh khadaa ho gaya hum
 The spiritual master said that the injustice done to the farmers in the country did not happen to any other class
 duniya main sabase zyada anaaj or saag-sabji ugane vaala desh bharat he, lekin phir bhi yahaan ye chijen mahangi hai
 There is something black in the lentils

 mahagathbandhan main jagah nahin milane se naaraaz jan adhikaar party ke adhyaksh pappu yadav ne madhepura or purniya se chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 In Maghepura, he is expected to be pitted against Mahagathbandhan candidate Sharad Yadav and in Purnia against Congress candidate Pappu Singh
 unhone kaha ki vah 26 march ko madhepura se or 28 march ko purniya se apana namakan daakhil karenge
 Pappu Yadav contested from Madhepura in 2014 on an RJD ticket and won
 unhone jediu ke sharad yadav ko haraaya tha, lekin is baar sharad yadav argedy ke nishaan par chunaav lard rahen hai or argedy se nishkasit pappu yadav apni jan adhikaar party ke binar par chunaav ladenge
 With Pappu Yadav contesting from two places, it is certain that there will be a split in the Grand Alliance's votes
 pappu yadav kaaphi samay se mahagathbandhan se apane seat maangate rahen he lekin unhen seat nahin mili
 Annoyed Pappu Yadav said that the leaders of the Mahagbandhan are not opposed to the BJP but are opposed to Pappu Yadav
 pappu yadav ne congress ke raste mahagathbandhan main jane kaa prayaas bhi kiya
 He also expressed faith in the Congress
 is sambandh main wo kai baar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or bihar prabharee shakti singh gohil se milte rahe, lekin argedy ke yuva netaa or lalu yadav ke bete tejasvi yadav ne pehle hi pappu yadav ko riject kar diya tha
 The Congress also wanted to give a seat to Pappu Yadav but due to the opposition of Tejashwi, she too was cut off
 pappu yadav kii patni ranjita ranjan supaul se congress kii tikat par hi chunaav jiti thim or is baar bhi supaul se congress kaa tikat milanaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 It is clear that RJD will have to bear the loss of Pappu Yadav contesting elections in Madhepura and Congress in Purnia
 halaki, pappu yadav ko abhi bhi congress se ummid he ki shaayad koi nirnay le taaki wo apana vikalp talash saken
 Congress has announced to make Uday Singh alias Pappu Singh its candidate from Purnia, while Sharad Yadav from Madhepura will be RJD candidate
 aise main pappu yadav ne khagadiya se chunaav ladane kii ichha jataai he taaki wo mahagathbandhan main aa saken

 mujffarpur balika grih balaatkaar maamle main aakhirkaar samaaj kalyaan vibhaag kii mantri manju verma ko istipha dena padaa
 On Wednesday afternoon, Manju Verma met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at his official residence 7, Circular Road and submitted his resignation
 manju verma ne apana istipha tab diya jab mujffarpur cond ke mukhya aaropee brijesh thakur ne mantri ke pati ke saath santhganth kii baat kabuuli
 The script of Manju Verma's resignation began to be written from Wednesday morning, when CBI sources investigating the Muzaffarpur scandal revealed that Brijesh Thakur, along with Chandeshwar Verma, the minister's husband, between January and May 17 spoke on the phone
 sibiai ne brijesh thakur ke do mobile sim card ko japt kiya he, jiskaa number 943xxx0777 or 896xxx9 777 he
 CBI has been scrutinizing the call detail records of both these mobile numbers for the last few days
 isi dauraan kol detail se sibiai ko is baat kaa pataa chalaa ki pichley kuch maheenon main 17 baar brijesh thakur ne mantri ke pati se unke mobile number 947xxx8202 or 9709xxx203 par baat kii
 CBI investigation has also revealed that many times Brijesh Thakur and Chandeshwar Verma used to fly to Delhi by airplane
 jaanch main is baat ke bhi saboot mili hai ki brijesh thakur hi aksar is yatra ke liye paise kharch kiya karata tha
 The CBI is currently looking for a travel agency that used to book plane tickets for both of them
 sibiai kii jaanch ke dauraan is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua he ki pichley kuch maheenon main chandeshwar verma 9 baar us balika grih main gaya jahaan 34 ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar hua he
 Significantly, Shibha Singh, wife of Ravi Roshan, a child protection officer arrested in Muzaffarpur, has also alleged that the minister's husband often used to come to the girl child and told her officers to stay on the ground floor and go to that first floor themselves Used to go where girls lived
 lekin is puure maamle main sabase sansanikhej khulaasa tab hua jab brijesh thakur ne buudhvaar ko pokso court main peshi se pehle media se baat karte hue yah baat ko kabool kiya ki uske chandreshwar verma ke saath rishte the or vah aksar unase baaten kiya karata tha
 After this confession of Brijesh Thakur, it became difficult for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to let Manju Verma hold his post
 sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantri kii ore se manju verma ko sandesh pahunchaaya gaya ki vah is puure mudde ko lekar apana istipha de den
 Recognizing the Chief Minister's talk, at 2:30 pm on Wednesday, Manju Verma met the Chief Minister and submitted his resignation
 manju verma ke istife ko manjuur karne ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se rajyapal satyapal malik ko bhej diya gaya he

 These students demonstrated outside their institute near ITO, Delhi

 How can this happen
 hamaara system logon ko daudane main maahir he
 a student from Odisha has written that in 2017 the supply inspector's examination form came out, the examination took place in November 2018 but in September 2019, there is no idea where the result is
 odisha se chaatr likh rahe hai ki rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog chaar se paanch saal main pariksha kaa riselt nahin nikaalata he
 On 24 December 2016, the Police Sub Inspector was reinstated
 teen saal baad yani 8 sitambar 2019 ko isaki pehali pariksha hui he
 Neither any government is watching nor any court
 naujavaanon ko sarkaron ne pareshaan karne main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Now there is only one support
 non resident indian ko yah baat bataai jaae ki bharat ke noujvaan jo pariksha dete hai uskaa riselt chaar saal main bhi nahin aata he
 The advertisement for the reinstatement of Assistant Commercial Tax Officer came in 2016 in Odisha itself
 uski prelimanary pariksha 2017 main hui
 The result has not come till today
 abhi mens intervyuu or apointment baaki he
 The United Nations should do research on India's examinations
 harvard or oxford ke research bhi bharat ke in yuvaaon par shodh kar sakate hai
 It is amazing that even after showing for months, the government and society are not making a difference
 sabase acchhee baat he ki yah baat yuva bhi samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki unke saath kya ho rahaa he
 This is the best thing
 aap in chehron ko nahin pahchaan paaenge
 Actually we did not know

 The grandfather of this child was displaced for a scheme, now he is fighting the battle of grand justice
 1960 main dada ji ke samay pong baandh ke liye zamin lee gai thi or ab unka pota 2019 main punarvaas kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 These eyes were noticed when hundreds of letters started coming from our office
 ye sabhi himachal pradesh ke kangra zile ke hai
 You will not believe that these people have been fighting for their right for 50 years
 supreme court se jeet jane ke baad bhi inhen punarvaas kii zamin nahin mili he
 If plans are announced then development is development
 wo log jo yojanaon se dur hote hai, hedline dekhakar khush ho jate hai
 Those whose plans are to be realized on the ground, their senses fly away
 wo lambey samay ke liye mukademon or andolanon kii sharan main dhakel die jate hai
 All governments have many rehabilitation policies to show, but until they are implemented, such a long time is spent that neither the press is interested and if you want too much of the report gets entangled in the answer or question
 Do not understand nor answer
 jo aam aadmi hota he vah samay samay par binar liye pradarshan kar rahaa hota he
 Taking information from RTI
 pradhanmantri se lekar chif justise tak ko patr likhata rahata he
 The whole case is made such that the one who is displaced appears to be a liar
 har din himachal ke kangra se is tarah darjanon patr aate hai
 All letters are typed
 neeche bhejne vaale kaa naam he, signechar he
 The sender states that he is a displaced farmer of Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh and has been struggling for rehabilitation for 50 years
 50 saal guzar gaye
 If you do the same check where you missed, then months will pass
 inhone apane patr main jo kaha he uske anusaar rajasthan kii zarurat ke liye jab pong par baandh bana to kangra zile kii upjau zamin dub gai
 In which 339 villages were drowned and one and a half lakh people became homeless
 1970 main punjab, himachal or rajasthan ke mukhyamantriyon ke bich samjhauta hota he ki har visthapit ko 15 acre se kuch adhik zamin di jaaegi
 2 in Sriganganagar for this
 20 lakh acre zamin nikaali gai
 But after reaching the waters of Indira Canal, the government forgot the Pong's displaced
 bhu-mafiaon ne farji kaagazat banaakar visthapit kisaanon kii zamin apane naam kar lee or kisaanon ko kuch nahin mila
 The farmers then went to the Supreme Court in 1996
 supreme court se kisaan jeet gaye or adaalat ne zamin dene ke liye puri vyavastha kii, cameti banaai, cameti ke sadsy tay kiye
 From 1996 to 2019, the High Power Committee was able to hold only 24 meetings in 24 years
 sriganganagar kii upjau zamin na dekar jaisalmer or bikaner main retili, banjar bhoomi de di gai
 Where there is no electricity, no water, no road or school
 phir usee hai power cameti ne aktubar 2017 main likhaa ki yah zamin kheti laayak nahin he
 Canceling the allocation of that land and asked that new land be given
 48 saal se ye cameti cameti main uljhe hue hai magar zamin nahin mili
 This letter has definitely come to me but is addressed to the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi
 50 saal lag jate hai punarvaas ke
 This is justice, of the system
 is patr main kisaanon ne apana phone number, gaanv kaa pataa sab diya he
 Those who can write have barely written their names and those who cannot sign have put their thumb impression there
 aaj ke press ko maaloom nahin he ki aisi samasyaon kaa kawarej kaise ho
 So people are writing letters
 kangra ke in kisaanon kii maansik pareshaani kaa andaaza kiijie
 That committee, while doing court, must have been broken in 50 years
 yah he hamaara system he
 In fact, this is the meaning of getting everything right in India
 jaisaa he vaisaa hi bane rah janaa he sab thik hona he
 When the displacement took place 50 years ago, there were 17000 families but now their family has grown up to 35-40 thousand
 kisaanon kii teesri peedi haq kii ladaai lard rahi he
 On the other hand, in these 24-30 years, so many papers will have been deposited in the High Power Committee, how many officers have come and gone that their answers have no meaning
 aakhir ham 50 saal main in kisaanon kaa punarvaas nahin kar pate hai
 The administration knows that the journalists will also leave tangled, but watch the endurance of the people's fight, they have been fighting for their land and rights for 50 years
 media main aane ke baad bhi kise fark padaa he ki sardaar sarovar baandh main pani bharna shuru hua to madhya pradesh ke 178 gaanv dub gaye
 Water was flooding in Gujarat, villages were drowning in Madhya Pradesh
 mukhyamantri patr vatra likhane kii aupchaarikta puri kar jate hai magar gaanvon kaa doobana ruk nahin paata he
 Ranjana Hiralal Gore's house was flooded in Khaparkhera in Dhar
 ranjana apane ghar se nikalnaa hi nahin chaahati thim
 Somehow evacuated but their house was drowned
 parivaar kahata he ki abhi tak punarvaas kaa anudaan nahin mila he, kahaan jaaen
 Wahid also disintegrated in Chikhalda
 dekhte dekhte ghar angan sab dub gaya
 Medha Patkar is also fighting here, but imagine that there is no one to fight for the farmers of Kangra
 medha patkar ko media jaanata he phir bhi ab unki ladaai ko dikhaane likhane kii aupchaarikta bhi nahin karata
 In some parts, there is news of their movement, but more than 170 villages were drowned no one was impressed
 praveen kaa ghar dub gaya to usne narmada main hi chalaang laga di
 Somehow the sailors saved him
 aam log samaj nahin paae apni jaan bachaae yaa maveshi kii yaa phir apana ghar bachaae yaa gaanv
 The claim of rehabilitation is something of the government, there are other things about the farmer
 anuraag dwari ne pichley dinon is par vistaar se report dikhaai thi
 What you are seeing is the affected farmers of Kangar's Pong Dam for the last 50 years
 unhen punarvaas kii zamin nahin mili
 For 50 years, the farmers of Kangra have been fighting for their rehabilitation
 narmada ke visthapiton kii kahani ab media main bhi thakne lagi he lekin jinaki zamin gai he, jinke ghar duube hai, wo kaise apane gaanv or ghar bhul sakate hai

 Veteran leaders of BJP and Congress are holding rallies for the Karnataka assembly elections
 raajnneetik dal lagaataar ek-duusare par hamale bol rahe hai
 Here the challenge before the Congress is to save its fort, then to end its exile in front of the BJP
 karnataka main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi khud reliyaan kar rahe hai
 Also on Tuesday, Sonia Gandhi is going to campaign
 mangalvaar ko rahul gandhi ne jahaan ek ore piem modi or bijepi par hamalaa bolaa, to duusari ore logon se kai vaade kiye
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress will build 50 lakh houses in the next five years
 piem modi ne rojgaar kaa vaada kiya tha, jise unhone todaa
 Read the highlights of his speech
 karnataka main lakhon logon ko rojgaar mila
 Karnataka leads the state in providing employment
 hamaari sarkaar ai to agle paanch saal main ek karod logon ko rojgaar degi
 Water will reach every corner of Karnataka
 ham mahilaon ko sarkari naukariyon main 33 fisadi aarakshan denge
 Basavanna said, do what you say
 bijepi adhyaksh yahaan aae, unhone vaada kiya tha ki emspi ko badhayenge
 They talk about the farmers, but when the time comes to help, their words are hollow
 bijepi ne loksabhaa main emspi badhaane kaa mudda uthaaya he
 You lost Rs 450 crore, but they didn't give you Rs 5 crore
 mujhe khushi he ki pehali baar karnataka kii sarkaar ne online trading shuru kii he
 That too in Tiptur
 chunaav main aapako chunanaa he ki aap garibon kaa siem chaahate hai yaa bhrasht siem
 Do you want to choose the Congress party which helps the poor, the weak or the BJP that allows four-five people to commit corruption? This time Congress workers have stood together
 yahaan par vichaardhaara kii ladaai chal rahi he, ek ore congress, ek ore bijepi or bich main jedies
 This battle cannot be stood in the middle
 janata dal secular (jedies) ke naam main es secular shabd he, lekin karnataka main sawaal uth rahaa he ki es kaa matlab secular he yaa sangh parivaar he? unako sidhaa kah dena chahie, ve kis said main hai- karnataka kii janata kii said main aresas-bijepi kii said main
 Congress will win and develop in elections
 hamaare kaaryakarta hamaari vichaardhaara ke liye ladate hai
 At the same time, BJP has also fielded Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the election campaign
 mangalvaar ko piem modi ne karnataka ke coppal main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that BJP believes in patriotism and social service, whereas Congress works only for the family
 gujarat main jari vidhansabha chunaav ab kendra sarkaar ke liye kadi chunauti ban chukaa he
 In the midst of saving the credibility of the BJP in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state and the efforts of Rahul Gandhi sitting in the Opposition to bring the Congress to the front, the Modi government at the Center does not want to take any risk that will backfire in the Gujarat elections
 yahi vajah he ki rajya main chunaavon ke maddenjar kendra sarkaar dari hui he
 Questions are not arising on the central government
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main uthe in sawaalon ke peeche raajnneetik vajahen bhi bataai ja rahi hai
 First question: Why did the Modi government stop the latest GDP data? State Bank of India has claimed in its research that in the second quarter (july-september) of FY 2017-18, the gross domestic product (GDP) is below 6% Are expected to chaalu vitt kii pehali timahi (april-june) ke dauraan jidipi aankade teen saal ke nunatam str 5
 Had reached 7 percent
 is giravat ke liye kendra sarkaar dwaara desh kii arthvyavastha ko pehle notebandi kaa jhatka or phir 1 july se gharelu kaarobaar ko guds and services tex (jiesti) kaa jhatka diya janaa jimmedaar he
 However, this trend of decline according to SBI Research 6 during the third and fourth quarter of the current financial year
 5 fisadi par aakar tham jayega
 But the biggest challenge facing the second quarter data is voting in Gujarat
 rahul gandhi ne narendra modi ke garh main bijepi ko hilaane ke liye arthvyavastha ke saath kendra sarkaar ke chhedchhad ko mudda banane main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 To keep its point among the people of Gujarat, the Congress has enlisted the help of ex-finance minister p Chidambaram and all the left-wing economists of the party, including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ise bhi padhein: mahangaai kii aahat, sakapakaai modi sarkaar ne aayaat-niryaat par shuru kii bandishenvahin raajnneetik galiyaaron main congress netaa anand sharma kii pahal ke baad sawaal uth rahaa he ki kendra sarkaar chunaavon ke maddenjar aarthik aankadon ke saath khilwaad kar rahi he
 He is afraid that the coming figures of the second quarter may not force the Congress attack and he has to face the elections
 gauratlab he ki aamtaur par duusari timahi ke jidipi aankaden 1 november tak jari ho jane chahie the
 Second question: Modi government postponed Winter Session of Parliament? Winter Session of Parliament usually starts in the third week of November
 lekin disambar main gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon ke maddenjar sansad kaa yah ahm satr philhal taal diya gaya he
 Such is the claim of sources in the Central Government and the Parliament Secretariat
 sutron ke mutabik gujarat chunaavon main prachaar kii antim taarikh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ko taal diya gaya he
 Normally around Deepawali, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs fixes the date for the winter session, but Deepawali has been delayed for more than a month and the Central Cabinet meeting has not been called to this effect
 sutron kaa daawa he ki ab sheetakaaleen satr kaa elaan gujarat chunaavon main prachaar thamane ke baad kiya jayega
 ALSO READ: Historic relief of crude oil prices ending, now will knock inflation! Third question: Why is the government silent on the Padmavati controversy? Producer-director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film has been engulfed in controversy for more than a week
 film kii relies ko gujarat chunaavon ke prachaar tak taalane ke sanket die ja chuke hai
 So far, where Karni Sena has threatened to attack Sanjay Leela Bhansali, to cut the nose of the film's actress Deepika Padukone
 deshbhar se bijepi ke saansad, vidhayak or netaa film ke virodh main sur alaap rahe hai
 It is believed that Rajput families across the country have raised objections to the love shown between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in the film
 in logon kaa maananaa he ki film main itihaas ko galat dhang se pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Amidst all this, the Central Government has kept silence in the whole matter at the moment
 vahiin bijepi ke aalaa netaaon kaa maananaa he ki film main rajasthan ke kshatreey rajgharaanon ko galat dhang se darshaya gaya he
 The special thing is that the BJP as well as the Congress leaders have also voiced their opposition to the film
 ab raajnneetik galiyaaron main mana ja rahaa he ki is vivaadit film par vipaksh ke saath-saath sattarudh dal bhi khadaa he
 So there is a possibility that the film will not be released before the elections in Gujarat

 BP Sharma, CMD of Pawanhans Helicopters Limited, the company that runs the subsidy heliport service on behalf of the Center, says that to promote regional air transport, the Central Government is already giving subsidy in its kings
 yahi vajah he ki helicopter se ghoomane kaa kiraaya itnaa sasta rakhaa gaya he

 Aam Aadmi Party leader and famous poet Kumar Vishwas is often in the discussion due to his statements
 bijepi ne shanivaar ko hi unke ek bayaan par shikaayat darj karai thi
 Meanwhile, while addressing an election meeting in Delhi's Narela Assembly, Vishwas lashed out at BJP leaders
 narela ke metro vihaar main arvind kejariwal kii sabha main vishwaas ne bijepi netaaon par jamkar vyangy baan chode
 Kumar Vishwas appeared here in his poet avatar
 unhone bijepi ke sabhi netaaon par jamkar chutki lee
 Vishwas created an atmosphere of Kavi Sammelan and reminded people of the press conference where Kiran Bedi was inducted into the BJP
 unhone kaha, 'press conference karne ke baad dilli bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay kaa cheharaa dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha jaise dulhe ne kot silava liya lekin ghodi bhaag gai
 They did not stop
 unhone harshavardhan ke bare main kaha ki harshavardhan ke chehre se harsh gaayab tha
 Jagdish Mukhi looked sad at that time
 vishwaas ne bijepi ko kaaliyon kii fouj kaha to khud ko or kejariwal ko sholay kaa jai-viru bataaya
 In the public meeting of Narela, Kumar Vishwas did not spare even Prime Minister Modi
 unhone modi kii jamkar nakal utaari
 Vishwas said that when BJP did not find any honest person in his party, he took it from our team and declared him as the CM candidate
 kumaar vishwaas puure rang main the or kisi ko bhi bakshne ke mood main nahin the
 He said that this is the first time that the Prime Minister of the country has left his job and is wandering in the streets of Delhi himself
 media par bhi tanj kasate hue vishwaas ne kaha, 'ye yahaan isliye aae hai ki main kuch boluun or ye shaam ko tivi par chalaaen, phir fisali jubaan

 aspx Rhetoric has an important role in deciding the direction of politics
 ab congress netaa shakeel ahamed ko le lijie
 He has made a statement on the blast outside the BJP office in Bangalore, which became a necklace for his own party
 bangalore dhamaake se bijepi ko phayda hoga: shakeel ahmadbangalore main hue dhamaake ke chand ghante ke andar hi shakeel ahamed ne twit karke kaha ki is dhamaake kaa bijepi ko chunavi phayda ho saktaa he
 Shakeel Ahmed was criticized all around as soon as the statement came out
 congress ne is bayaan se pallaa jhaad liya to bijepi ne is gaiyr-jimmedaarana qaraar diya
 Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi even gave him the advice not to do politics on terrorism
 bangalore BLAST: bayanon ke saath shuru 'siyaasi' jangdansal, congress pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne twit kiya tha, 'agar bijepi daftar ke baahar hua dhamaakaa aatanki hamalaa he to bijepi ko iskaa chunavi phayda jarur hoga
 BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain made a sharp comment on this statement of Shakeel Ahmed
 shahanvaaj hossain ne kaha, 'congress netaaon ko is tarah ke gaiyr-jimmedaarana bayaan nahin dena chahie
 i will ask the Congress whether the Congress has benefited from the earlier bomb blasts
 'grih rajyamantri arpyen singh ne shakeel ahamed ke vivaadit bayaan se duuri banaate hue kaha, 'yah unki nijee raay ho sakati he
 Congress does not do politics on such issues
 'congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne bhi ishaaron main hi shakeel ahamed kii khinchaai kar daali
 He said that there should be no politics on terrorism
 sipiai netaa di raja ne shakeel ahamed ke twit ko anuchit or betuka bataaya
 He said let the NIA investigate the blast, there should not be such rhetoric
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki kya shakeel ahamed ke is ke liye khamiyaja bhi bhugatna padegaa? The popularity of 'bahubali: The Beginning' is so spread that the audience is watching every step of its main character 'bahubali' i

 Prabhas
 vartmaan main is film ke sikval 'bahubali : da conclujan' ke liye prabhas kaaphi pasinaa baha rahe hai
 He worked hard for four months and is following his 'diet chart' completely
 iske liye prabhas ko junk food, meetha or icecream khaanaa sakht manaa he, lekin agar baat icecream kii ho, to 'bahubali' ko rokna mushkil he
 The comments aise main pichley ek saal se chal rahe sawaal ki katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa? kaa jawaab bhi shaayad is par joke banane vaale yah kahkar den ki bahubali iscream khaane kii jid kar rahaa tha, isliye katappa ne use maar diya
 Sources associated with Prabhas said that the actor loves ice cream and his favorite flavor is 'fruit Exotica', which he rarely consumes despite strict instructions
 bahubali manamaujee he or isliye is baat par film ke nirdeshak es
 Rajamouli also does not get angry
 unhone chaar maah tak ji-tod mehnat kii or purna rup se apane 'diet chart' kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 For this, Prabhas is strictly forbidden to eat junk food, sweet and ice cream, but if it is about ice cream, it is difficult to stop 'bahubali'
 tippaniyan In such a situation, the question that has been going on for the last one year, why Katappa killed Bahubali? Perhaps the jokers on this answer should say that Bahubali was insisting on eating ice cream, so Katappa killed him
 prabhas se jude sutron ne bataaya ki abhinayta ko icecream behad pasand he or unka pasandida flavor 'fruit exotica' he, jise vah sakht hidaayat ke baavjood bhi kabhi-kabhaar kha hi lete hai
 Bahubali is capricious and hence the film's director S

 iske baad duplasis or petersan ne apni takat or kaushal kaa namoona pesh kiya
 After this, the scenario changed and Duplessis and Peterson were unable to maintain this momentum

 com / fba5qs5jhj manoj kumaar ko hindi cinema ke bharat kumaar ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Manoj acted in several films involving patriotic feelings
 manoj kumaar ek actor hone ke saath-saath ek lekhak bhi rahe hai
 Telling some stories related to his life on his birthday
 manoj kumaar kaa puraa naam hari kishan giri goswami tha
 He was born on 24 July 1937
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke hindu college se unhone apni padhai kii
 After this, the idea of working in films knocked him in his mind
 magar filmon ke prati unki ruchi 10 saal kii umr main hi aa gai thi
 There is also an interesting anecdote associated with Manoj Kumar for working in films
 manoj ne apni mangetar shashi goswami se poochkar filmon main kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Manoj Kumar also narrated the story of his struggle
 rajyasabha tivi ko die gaye intervyuu main unhone bataaya ki kaise ve rifuji camp main rahete the or mushkilon main jivan gujaarte the
 During this time, he lost his younger brother at a very young age
 manoj kumaar ne apana aapa kho diya tha or ve marpet karne lag gaye the
 During this time, they also had to eat police poles
 jab baat had se aage bad gai to unke pita ne unhen kasam dilaai ki ve kabhi bhi marpet nahin karenge
 Actually, when Manoj got an offer to work as a lead actor in a film, he said that he would not work in films without the permission of his fiance
 phir unhone shashi se is bare main baat kii
 When Shashi agreed, Manoj Kumar said yes to work in the film
 baad main shashi se hi unhone shaadi bhi kar lee
 Manoj Kumar was awarded the Padma Shri in 1992 by the Government of India for his outstanding work
 saal 2015 main unhen film main apane yogadan ke liye dada sahab phalke aword se sammanit kiya gaya
 India had two successes in the US Open Grand Slam lawn tennis tournament

 unhone ek ghanta 17 minute main 6-4, 6-1 se match apane naam kiya
 Sania and Martina scored 72 out of a total of 125 points

 Hingis later defeated second seeded pair of Rohan Bopanna of India and Yung Jan Chan of Chani Taipei 6-2, 7-5 in the semi-finals of the mixed doubles category along with Paes
 yah mukaable ek ghante se kuch adhik samay tak chalaa
 Paes has won the mixed doubles title here in 2008 and has won the men's doubles title three times here in 2006, 2009 and 2013
 final main pes or martina kaa saamana america kii bethane matek or sam quere ke saath hoga

 Input: IANS ekta kapur kaa popular tivi serial 'ye hai mohabbatein' aajkal apni fain folowing khota hua dikh rahaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the serial's story is also taking a peculiar turn
 kisi jamaane main top rated rah chukaa yah sho aaj top 10 kii list main sabase neeche aa chukaa he
 The show of actors Divyanka Tripathi and Karan Patel was launched on 3 December 2013
 is kahani main shaadi se lekar talaak, dobaaraa shaadi, extra-marital afaire, lav-triangal, garbhpaat, sarogesi, murder, hostage, aatankwaadi hamalaa, bukamp, bhoot or aatma kaa saaya, magaramchh hamalaa, adaalat main tamaashe or na jane kya kya dikhaaya gaya
 Many twist audiences also liked it
 lekin kahani abserial ke mukhya paatro se hatatinjar aa rahi he
 According to sources, in the next story Raman Bhalla will be married to lawyer Nidhi and currently struggling with death, Ishita will soon return to the pair with ACP Abhishek
 asal jindagi main bhi ishita (divyanka treepathi) or asipi abhishek (vivek dahia) kii sagaai ho chuki he
 According to BARC India data, the ranking of this serial stood at 8 on the rating chart in the week ended 19 February
 saal 2016 kii shuruyaat se hi yah sho apni populerity kho rahaa he
 Breaking the Ishita and Raman duo might be a twist for the show's producers, but it could be bad for the show from the audience's perspective

 saal 2004 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ne satta main vaapasi ke liye india shining kaa naaraa diya or iske prachaar abhiyaan ke liye karodon rupee kharch karne or duniyabar main desh kii chhavi chamakaane ke baavjood aam chunaav main haar mili or vaajapeyi ko satta se bedakhal hona padaa
 Click here to pay homage to Atalji, despite the change in attitude from allies and lack of change in the ground condition of the people due to immense self-confidence, running campaigns like India Shining are considered to be the two main reasons for the defeat of the Vajpayee government
 flop sabit hua india shining abhiyansaal 2004 main aam chunaav ke pahaleindia shining abhiyaanke peeche bijepi ke tatkaaleen 'chanakya' pramod mahajan kii soch maani jaati he or ise grey worldwide aidwartiging company ke nirvik singh ke netritv main saakaar kiya gaya tha
 India was being described as an emerging and bright country through India Shining, on the other hand the figures on the ground were telling a different story
 is abhiyaan ke pichley teen saal main bharat kii jidipi main badhat kramash: 4
 4 per cent (2000-01), 6 per cent (2001-02) and 3
 8 fisadi (2002-03) hi thi
 BJP shed crores of rupees like water on the campaign of India Shining
 is abhiyaan ke dwaara yah bataane kii koshish kii gai ki bijepi sarkaar main desh kii kaaphi tarakkee hui or logon ke jivan main baari badlaav aayaa he
 But India Shining liked only big businessmen and the stock market, not the public
 sach to yah he ki amiron or garibon ke bich khai bad rahi thi
 Unemployment was at its peak
 garibon kii haalat behad kharaab thi
 India had gone further down in the United Nations Human Development Index
 peyajal, buniyadi dhaanche, shiksha or bijli jaisi mul jaruraton par sarkari kharch ghat rahaa tha
 The anti-bjp slogans used this slogan to tell voters whether they really feel that India is shining? Are their houses shining? 
 
 ? bharat main jabardast garibi he
 
 
 Farmers have their own problems
 
 
 bharat kahaan chamak rahaa he?'sahyogi dalon se berukhi'india shining'ke naare se atmamugdh bijepi ne 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apane teen aise mahatvapurn sahyogi dalon se naata tod liya tha, jinhone san 1999 main use satta main pahunchaaya tha
 The BJP had then made the mistake of ignoring the strength of the vote banks of those regional parties
 iskaa nateeja yah hua kiatal sarkarasan 2004 main satta se baahar ho gai
 Then the BJP was so confident of its victory that it held elections ahead of time
 bijepi ke berukhi kii vajah se saal 2004 ke aam chunaav se pehle diemke, indian neshnal lokdal or lojpa jaise dal endie se baahar ho gaye
 The NDA lost 55 seats in the Lok Sabha due to the separation of these three parties
 2004 main endie ko kul 185 siten mili thim
 Had these parties been together, he would have got 240 seats
 bijepi kii siten bhi 1999 ke 182 ke mukaable 2004 main ghatakar 138 hi rah gayi
 After the election, BJP leader LK Advani himself said that the NDA lost the 2004 general election due to excessive self-confidence and wrong slogans like 'india Shining'
 unhone kaha ki ati vishwaas or india shining jaise galat naaron kaa istemaal karne ke kaaran ham haar gaye
 The Gujarat riots also suffered losses: The 2002 riots in Gujarat also resulted in losses to the then NDA government
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne apni aatmakatha 'da coalishan ears 1996-2012' main likhaa he, 'gujarat main 2002 main hue dange atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar par sambhavat: sabase bada dhabba the or iske kaaran hi 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 'mukherjee wrote,' Vajpayee was an outstanding MP
 bhashaa par umdaa pakad ke saath vah ek shandaar vaktaa bhi the, jinamein tatkaal hi logon ke saath jud jane or unhen saath le aane kii kala thi
 In politics, Vajpayee was getting the trust of the people and in the process he was earning the respect of his party, allies and opponents in the country
 vahiin, videsh main unhone bharat kii sauhardrapurn chhavi pesh kii or apni videsh niti ke jariye desh ko duniya se joda
 According to 'mukherjee,' nda's India Shining campaign was completely reversed and there was a wave of disappointment in the BJP, due to which Vajpayee was sad that he could never understand the voter's mind
 '2004 ke aam chunaav oktober main hone the, lekin bijepi ne madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav main mili jeet ko dekhte hue chah maheene pehle hi chunaav kara liye the
 Mukherjee said, 'there was a wave of happiness in BJP due to victory in important states
 haalanki kuch logon ne in parinaamon ko rashtriya rujhaan samajhane kii bhul na karne kii salaah bhi di thi
 ' chini airforce ke ladaaku vimaanon se loha lene ke liye bhartiya vayusena ko mili akaash mixilon main se kam se kam 30 fisadi shuruaati jaanch main fail ho gaye
 a recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has also stated that the use of Akash missile in any war-like situation is not reliable and that is why it was not deployed on the eastern border
 jameen se hawa main maar karne vaale ye swadeshi missile bharat ke 'chikan nek' kahalaane vaale siliguri coridor sahit china seemaa se sate chah ahm base par lagane the
 The CAG said in its report laid before Parliament on Thursday that between 2013 and 2015, these missiles were to be launched at these places, but no missile has been planted till now
 khaas baat yah he ki bharat or chini sena ke bich doklam main jis jagah par aamanaa-saamana hua he, vah silligudi coridor se kuch hi kimi dur he
 Made by Bharat Electronics Limited (bell), the total cost of these missiles is around Rs 3900 crores, out of which the Airforce has paid Rs 3800 crores
 purvi seemaa par vaastavik niyantran rekha ke kareembhartiya vaayu senaco chah akaash missile squadran tainaat karnaa tha
 China has eight fully operational airbases in Tibet
 sieji ne apni report main kaha he, 'bada masalaa yah he ki semple test main 30 fisadi tak fail hona isaki vishwasaneeyata par sawaal khadey karata he
 Whereas 95 per cent payment has been made on the basis of this
 'badtar baat yah he ki sieji ke mutabik kam se kam 70 missile kii jivan kaal kam se kam 3 saal aise hi is vajah se bekaar ho gaya, kyonki unke storage ke liye koi suvidha uplabdh nahin thi
 Each Akash missile costs crores
 isi vajah se 150 anyamissile kaajivan kaal do se teen saal or 40 missile kaa jivan kaal ek yaa do saal kam ho chukaa he
 The life span of the Akash missile is 10 years from the 'manufacturing date' and they have to be stored under certain controlled conditions
 upie sarkaar ne saal 2010 main hi akaash missile kii silligudi coridor main tainaati ko manjuuri de di thi

 - It is not right to bring girls from here and there on the day of main girl worship
 - grih pravesh par kanyaon kaa puure parivaar ke saath pushp varsha se swaagat karen or nav durga ke sabhi nau naamon ke jayakaare lagaaein
 Now, these girls should sit in a comfortable and clean place and place their feet in a plate or plate filled with milk and wash their feet with their hands and should be blessed by touching their feet

 Then, after meditating on Mother Bhagwati, provide food to these goddess girls as desired

 What should be the age of the girls in the worship of the girl? The age of the girls should be above two years and up to 10 years and their number should be at least 9 and there should also be a child who is considered to be the form of Hanumanji
 jis prakaar maa kii puujabhairavake bina purna nahin hoti , usee tarah kanya-pujan ke samay ek balak ko bhi bhojan karana bahut jaruri hota he
 If more than 9 girls are coming to the banquet then there is no objection

 Worship of this family leads to welfare
 jabaki paanch varsh kii kanya rohinee kehalaati he
 By worshiping Rohini, a person becomes disease free

 Kalika forms Vidya, Vijay, Raja Yoga

 By chanting the Chandika form one attains austerity
 - aath varsh kii kanya shaambhavi kehalaati he

 sirf 9 din hi nahin haijivanabhar karen inkaa sammaan-navaratri main bharat main kanyaon ko devi tulya maanakar puja jaataa he
 But some people forget all this after Navratri
 bahoot jagah kanyaon kaa shoshan hota he or unka apnaam kiya jaataa he
 Even today in many villages in India, Kanyaka's birth is celebrated
 aisa kyon? kya aap aisa karke devi maa ke in roopon kaa apmaan nahin kar rahe hai
 We have to change our thinking towards girls and women
 devi tulya kanyaon kaa sammaan karen
 Honoring them is as virtuous as worshiping God
 shastron main bhi likhaa he ki jis ghar main aurat kaa sammaan kiya jaataa he vahaan bhagwaan khud vaas karte hai
